Goldbug capitalist and their ad
vocates in congress and journalism,
in answer to the demand of the
people for an expansion of the cur
rency by the free and unlimited
coinage of silver and its restoration
to its place as one of the metals of
final payment, get it down fine
when they urge as an excuse for
their contention that the govern
ment would be acting dishonestly
if it palmed off 50-cent silver dol
lars on the people. But what do
the people care whether the unlim
ited coinage of silver should re sult
in 50-cent dollars, as comlpared with
the gold dollar, or not; they don't
expect to buy any ofthe gold. B at
they would have more dollars than
they now have, and they could use
each one of them for a dollar, and
prices of all products would rise and
they would again become proeper
ons. A 50-cent silver dollar-it
there be such a thing-would suit
the people jnflnitely better than <
does the now 200-cent gold dollar.- I1

GOODBYE WORLD, HOWDY
HELL.
Proctor Knolt'. Rac) letterl
Read in the HIouse Debate.
l)uring thlie debate in the house,
elsewhere reported, MIr. Hatch
read a letter fromn Proctor Knott,
of Kentucky, to Senator Black
burn. Our readers will doubtless!
enjivoy this pirotluction of the Uman
who delivered the famous D)uluth
speech while in congress in the
seventies, and it is given below in
full, as we find it in the Congres
sional lh-cord :
""I do not knoiw when my dermoc
racy has been more comipletely out
raged than by thel last insolent de
iIman111d of the golelites that the gov
ernment shall issue 5(K0),0(),000 in
~o.ld bonds and re.tire the treasury
note circulation with the proceeds.
They ijo not seem to want to leave
us even a hereafter.
(Laughter.)
"'You know, as 'everybody else
multst who has half as much sense
as a sucking guinea pig, that when
ever this governillmeint agrees to pay
that uaiinnut or a tithe of it in gold,
silver is doomned, so far as we are
concerned to all enternity. As old
.Judge Forbish said to Johnny
Mooth-, it had 'jest as well say
good-bye, world, and howdy
hell.' (Laulghter.)
"Great God ! how rapidly this
long sutleiring peolle are being
Sdriven to the dreadful alternative
of slavery or inter.ecine strife, to
determine whether they will tame
ly hohl out their hands and have
the shackles ot a remorseless plu
tocracy ri\ eted upon their wrists
or fight.
"Now mark what I say, it the
inexorable law of cause and effect
has not beeni expungted from the
statute book of the Almighty, uu
less a halt is called p. d. q. you
may expect to see the horrors of
the French revolution put on the
Aoerican stage with all the esn(
ern improvemaents, and that within
the next decade.
"I remember I was suspected by
some of mIav friends of political lu
nawcv in ldm); because I predicted
that in the event of Mr. Lincoln's
election there would he a war be
tween the states. They could not
see why it ought to be so. Neither
could I, but I knew the causes
which were at work, and which
would in the long run produce that
result, and I regarded hjs election
sinply as the spark which would
explode the mine. So, when the
fiery cloud appeared in less than
one short year which deluged the
country in blood for nearly a lus
trum some of those who had
thought me a croaker, a mere dys
peptic pessimist, began to retgard
me as Byron did Jeffreys--as "a
d-d, disconcerning fellow." I
tell you, Senator, in all seriouness,
I see far more reason to appre
hend the speedy approach of a ter
rible revolution in this country
than Lord Chesterfield saw in
France when he wrote his historic
prediction from Paris Nor am I
alone. That gentleman, Astor,
who went to England some time
ago, bought him a place on the
island, and became a British sub
ject, saw what is coming as plainly
as I do, so he took time by the
forelock and skipped out when
there was not such a rush for state
rooms- as there will be after a
while. Hle knew very well that
if things should keep on as you
and I have seen them for some
years past, the time was not far
off when there would be such a
crowd of his class of people hur
rying aboard every outgoing steam
er he might beshoved ol the stage
plank.
(Laughter.)
"Our good friend, Mr. Sibley,
sent me a copyof his magnificent
speech anent the Carlisle abortion
theother day. I was sick in bed a
when it came, lonesome and low-I
spirited, my wife in Louisville un
der treatment for her throat trou
ble, and not a Gol-blessedl friend
near me to cheer me up. Ireadit
over, in some places two or three
times, and it stirred my old blood
like the call of the trumpet stirs
that of the war horse, or perhaps
you will understand me better
when I say it acted on me like
good wine-King Solomon's favor
ite prescription to those that be of
heavy hearts.' (As the average
United States senator is not pre-'
sumed to be familiar with the I
Iwvritinv.- of that anii'n,!,t :iln thor,

SThe Over-Produc(llon hadow.
T A few of the cotton pila ters t
tlhe Southl I;\have wasted a great deal
of valuable tie ti tr3 ilng to discover
s some lmeans to reduce the pIrnFllte
ri Lion of cotton, and seen:u to believe
i that the low price is caused by
e over-p riOdlction.
I It must be sweet to the million
aire ghll hlolders of Europe and
the United States to see these rob
bed people blaimiiug an inole iisive
animaiill for stealiing their sustenance,
anid followiilng its trail shouting
ldeath to poor)1 "overplroduction,"
a while,they the real wolves, are
, sitting back in their carpeted of
fices smiling at the creduality of
e people who ought to have imoresenll.
It' there is any thing grown or iman
ufactured in this country, (which is
e not protected by patents,) that
e is ;ot said to be produced more than;
Sthe demand for it, point it out?
To Inchu cotton, sugar, rice, corn.
e potatoes, wool, hors'es, mules, sheep
I cattle-everythiug the farmer has
Y to sell is sold below the cost of pri.
Stduction, because of over-production,
and the manutifacurers will tell tou
s that they can't make ally mlioneiy;
that the market is overstocked, and
e that it hardly pays the wear and
tear ot machinery to keep runningiii
e at the present prices they receive
fir goods.
s According to those peold,4 who
shout "over- production,"jit wouold be
t a good thing for every boly in the
e United Staaes to take a year off
llland fish and hunt for a living, or
do nothing until conisumption catch
. es up with production.
We say to the cotton planters,
u who have been running arter a shad
dow, that it gold is continued the
sole standard of value, as It is at
this time, that iu two years a six
8 million bale cropof Annericau cotton
will sell at 3 cents per pound for
t middling.
r If the people ever expect to get
s higher prices for products they
t must make silver a standard money.
I These United States must again
I open the mints to the coinage of the
m noney named in the Constitution
of our Republic-gold and silver.
That was the law until John Sher
man got it rebealed and became
rich oy so doing. Re-enact the law
that was in existauce and operative
t during 70 years of the lite of this
Union and all will be well. Let
gold remain the sole stsndard of
value and the ruin and distress
throughout the length and breadth
oj the land will be appalling.

Hineton Ward is "Dry."
An election was held in Hines
ton ward on Feb. 2, 1895, for the 1
purlpose of taking the sense of the I
qualified voters of that ward as to
whether or not the sale of intoxica
ting licensed and sold in that ward.
The election resulted in 61 votes
against license and 19 votes in
fivorof license, so hereafter no in- I
toxicating liquors will be sold in
HIineston ward. Rapides parish is
now "dry" with the exception of the
towns of Alexandria, Boyce, Pine
