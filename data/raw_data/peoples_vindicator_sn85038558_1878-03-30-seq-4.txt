ni The city is expected to take fifty hy
F drlant for fire purptses at a cost of

Ssorely needed in Shreveport and we 1
ih hope to have them at no distant day.
r They would prove a great saving to

A curious instance of the decline

C(atse of Sudden Death.
[N. Y. Mereury.]
Very few of the sudden deaths which
are said to arise from diseases of the
heart do really arise from that cause. To
ascertain the real origin of sudden deaths
lexperiments haive been tried in Europe
and reported to a Scientific Congress held i
at Stralshorg. Sixty-six c as of suddten
death wore made the subject of ea thor- for
o99gh post-mortem examination ; in these
ollly two were found who had died from
disacose of the heart. Niine out of sixty.
six had died from apoplexy, while there
.!ere forty-six cases of congestion of the
longs--that is, the lungs wtreso fill of
dlood they could not work, there not be.
ing room enough for a quantity of air to
enter to Istpport lift. 'The ecauses that
prodnce congestion of the longs are cold
fet, tight clothing, costive bowels, seit
ting still, chilled alter being warmed A
with labor or rapid walk; going too sud- FIS
denly frou close, heated rooms into the PE
cohl icir, especially after speaking, and call
saudden depressing news olerating on the n
biosl. The causes of sodden death be.
ing known, an avoidance oif them may -
serve to lengthen tlany valuable lives
which would otherwise he lost, under the
virdlict o' "h art complaint. ThaTb
din-sse is supposed to be inevitable and KEI
Isuirable; hence manny do not take the
uains they would do to avoid sudden TO
death If they knew it lay it their power. $
