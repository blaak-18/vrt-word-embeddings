sight of a man daring to act and talk
counter to th* all pertading senti
ment of hearty loyalty "to the Confed

' After reeomtrnetion had
uenoed, that insane policy adopted
by the United States government
from hate and persisted m from oon r
flietency, the fruits of which that
same government will one day de
plore as England now deplores her
fatnoua Irish policy of two centuries
ago, the recreants who wefe blatant
in professions of loyalty to the Uni
ted States were required to show it
by a consuming " zeal for the negro
and hia rights. Brownlow was be
hind none, in his championship of
their newly acquired priviliges It is
not unlikely he was, or became sin
cere in his advocacy. Men some
times think of an idea, advocate it—
discus« it until they adopt it. BroWn
low maintained that the black man
and the white man were equal, that
each has the Same rights that all
roust alike respect, and that consti
tutions and laws and customs and
usages must all bo abrogated when
ever they conflict with this cardinal
.principle. * For thus acting as negro
champion, this reckless partisan) and
vile blot on the Christian ministry
was thrust ih the Senate to drsgraco
the wholo.country as he had his par
ticular*Bection of it. . „ ■<.(', (
And now the insolent aggressive
ness of tho negro's demands have
surpassed even' his expectations* and
provoked 0 his resistance. - Mixed
schools have bqen aH alöng the pet
scheme of the black levellers. They
see that tho white man can and does
keep aloof from the black. The
white woman shnns him as she would
a leper. But if they can force a com
minglement of-white and black chil
dren in the schools, they will at oDce
inflict a blow on the pride of" the
whites and enter tho wedge which
shall ultimately removo the last bar
rier^ between tho races. We all know*
the force of habit. Our own preju
dices on" this, subject are mainly due
to that. Once accustom white chil
dren to promiscuous contact with
blacks in their studies and sports—
and your next generation will eat and
drink with negroes as quick as the
late lamented Senator, whose eulogy
has been hypocritically pronounced
by Southern men. o
Brownlow waxes wrathful over this
new developement and still more
wrathful' over the impertinent dar
kîfes who presuine to denounce him
because he is no.longer .obedient to
their behôsts. You^have reversed
Tancy'sdecision, 8ays the despicable
creature to his black censors, and
maintain that a white man has no
rights that a negro is bound to res
pect And thus he, and those like
him, .who inspired and - -fomented this
«rasade far the jiegro, are waking
from their delusion. It is-°well that
it ia so. Redress of the' grievances
of the Southern whites cannot longer
be deferred.. If the Northern people
are influenced, as now seems proba
ble, by' a returning, sense of justice—
and (he re-action bqpomos practically
effective through governmental* ac
tion, these grievances will be redress
ed peaceably. If not, they will^be
redressed at all hazards by the surest
means^at our disposal.

When we annout
«M».
natism based on a practical reeog
"ilonito
(
wliite man for official positron and
political power, there wore some
who, while not condemning the
principle ae* heresy, yet thought
it injudioioua to lÉign to üa pro
mulgatkm n " special promlaenee.
The above Wtfteneis ahew what
was thought oa this matter by the
great Apostle of modern republi-.
canism. •They are sentences which
if carved upon hia tomb Would prob
ably dimiuiah the >nfimber of wOr
shippers at that Mecca of Uegro
dom, but they contain truths that
the white man would do «well to
ponder add the black man would
do well to believe.
Tokens are not wanting that s
healthy torn* of thought is superced
ing the sickly senti mental ism that
spread over .this countrymen the-ne
gro question after the great ^»nflict
that produced emancipation. The
conduct ot the negroes had materi
ally aided in producing this healthy
reaction. We do not-think it liaz
ardîms to predict that there will be
a total revulsion in public senti
ment on this matter within the
next two-yeârs. The negro is not
the equal of the white man and
cannot be°made so. In a country
where Abe two' races have long ex
istedinthe position of master and
slave aB here, you cannot by law
produce that wftich custom, preju
dice, and instinct fortrid. As the
fugitive slave law was not and could
not be enforced in the North because
of a controlling public sentiment
more powerful than law,°so a Civil
Right» bill which shall attempt to
make white and black companions
at tlie table, in hotels aud railroads
at theatres and the race track, will
n'ever be executed in the South
• And we wish here to state anoth
er conviction tho Caucasian has,
The negro, by claiming too much
is in danger-of losing that which
has already been conceded to him
He has aroused the pride of race
amour propre 06 the white man, and
the dictum of Mr. Lincoln may. be

honored him living, and mourns him
dead, as a bequest, the execution
of which is to it a paramount'duty.
The recent eilactment by an over

unfurling the party banner, rtrpect
fd maroii to victoryuuder the high
souiiding and distinctive title of the
Whi£e Man's Party.'* The name iß
not particularly "hTgh sounding,"
Imt after six years of oppression
and misrule, jsubiect to the govern
ment of the very worst class of
knaves and fools, forced *to submit
to*the domination of an ignorant
anS inferior race, whose impudence
and vaulting ambition knows no
bounds, the name of White Man's
Party, is however, euphonious and
conveys an idea, that creates
pleasant emotion, in the bosom of
every wlfite man, Who sighs for the
supremacy of his race, and the res
toration of an honest and good gov
ernmcnt.
The Telegram says : "The naine
is good, and its glittering sheen will
probably attrtict the influence, of
many who do not understand that
it is intended as an array of race
against race." We do not suppose
that there is a white man in Louis
iana, whose powers of perception
are so obtuse, as not to understand
that the, very object of the White
Man's Party, is to array the white
race into a political organization in
direct antagonism to the domina
tion of the negro race; to wage in
cessant warfare tor its supremacy,
and right of dominion in all things
pertaining to our local and State
governments. Is there any® one :n
this State that does not know that
the negroes have, from the date of
their enfranchisement, been held
together, and blindly led by a di
rect appeal to their prejudices of
race, and at every -election, have
demonstrated this fact-, by meeting
us at the polls with iin unbroken
front, voting directly in opposition
to the wfeite race aud its interests.
The White Man's Party makes no
new issues, it is merely accepting
those that are forced upon it, and
those that have existed in reality
tor tho last six years, although the
party has been called by a differ
ent name. Wo, therefore, have no
tears for tlic predictions of the Tel
egram, that many will be at first
attiacted, and then desert, when
they find out, what they of necessi
ty know now, that it is intended "as
an array of race against race."
But, says the Telcgrairf: "the
Democratic party or whatever name
the opponents to" Republicanism
may assume, can 110 more do with
out the colored vote than capital
can exist without labor, or labor
succeed without capital."
Such has not been the history of
the past. Tho Democratic -party,
Succeeded in« 18G8, in electing their
Presidential Electors, by a largo
majority aud we were told.by the
Republicans that it was a fraud be
cause the negro element refused to
vote the Democratic ticket through
out tho State, and assuming as they
have-always assumed, that the 11Ô
gro vote was in the* ascendency in
Louisiana, they therefore declared
the election one of fraud—carried
by intimidation and violence. Does
not the Editor of the Telegram re
member that the issue then was oue
of race, and the white race organ
ized into th<î Knights of the White
Camélia, succeeded"-in carrying the
election by a large majority, -with
bui> the assistance, the Republicans
said, of the negro vote.
Did we not have the same result

it hau been the opinion of the lead
ers of the Democratic jtarty in the
past, that the iujgro vote was ne
cessary, as "they made strenuous
efforts in past éâip paigns to seoure
and conciliate thd colored voter and
win him over to their sfde." ïhore
Ib no question bot that the Demo
cratic party and those.acting with
it, in opposition to Radicalism in
this State, have made strenuous ef
forts to obtain the negro vote and
have gone' so far in tbeir efforts -of
loncfli&tion that they aotually in
the last campaign, placed one of
their race on their ticket for'an im
portant state office, anâ yet the Re
publican Journals and politicians
denounced Armstcad as a traitor to
his party and race, and after the
election was over, vociferously de
nounced our efforts of conciliation
as an abortion, productive of no ben
eficial results; We frankly admit
the fact, and pur experience in that
campaign forces us to the conclu
sion^ that all efforts to conciliate
the negro voter will prove abortive
and more influence can be exercised
by private individuals, who come in
contact every day with their negro
laborers, than by a political party
that openly conciliates, exhibiting
thereby a degree of weakness,
in calling oil their bitterest ene
mies, when they shonld rely alone
upon on the strength and effective
ness of their own organization. It
is the humiliating experience of the
past, and the conviction that the
negro in Iiis ignorance and folly,
will not heed our efforts to concili
ate, however much it might be for
the interest of both classes, that we
lrave determined to accept the is
sue, which ho in his folly and stu
pidly has made, and aro therefore in
ôivor of a White Man's Party, be
cause we believö that it will unite
tho white people in Louisiana. But
says tho same Journal, "Let the
would bo apostles of a new party
study tlio political history of JFir
gitiia since the war, and they will
find that eo-opetation, liberality of
sentiment, and the union of all men
believiug in reform and honesty,
regardless of past affiliations, have
contributed to place that aud other
States in a healthy and prosperous
condition." If the Telegram means
that Virginia, by dropping the
name of the Democracy and uniting
all her white citizens inttf a conser
vative organization, that gained a
victory over Radicalism," wo agree
with it. In the last campaign in
Virginia, Governor Kemper made
the statement, in his political cam
paign, that the contest was.0110 of
race, the white contending for su
premacy In the government oyer the
negro. This issue wafe accepted by
the people, and VirglniaBs true to
their manhood and pride of race—
redeemed, end disenthralled their
State, from the ruinous rule o£ Rad
icalism. Many prominent men who
had affiliated hitherto with the Re.
publican party, joined in with- the
conservatives, and assisted in. the
contest, when it was announced
that it was one of white vs. black
And so we believe it will he in
Louisiana. The Whito Man's Par
ty pioscribes no one, but asks eve
ry citizen, that honostly wishes re
form in the State government, to
join Its standard, and whether Re
publican Journals. and politicians
favor it or not,- we feel confident
that its principles tfill succeed.
