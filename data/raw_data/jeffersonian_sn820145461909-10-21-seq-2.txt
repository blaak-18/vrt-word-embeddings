A REPLY TO THE JEFFERSONIAN
By Archibald McLean
N THE April Jeffersonian
there is a remarkable article
on missionaries. Some of
the statements in that arti-
I]
cle may mislead readers who are not
acquainted with the subject. To
prevent this, if possible, I submit
some observations and ask space for
them in the Jeffersonian.
Reference is made in the opening
paragraph to Mrs. Jellyby. It may
be that Dickens knew a woman who
was deeply interested in Africa and
who neglected her own home and
children. But if Dickens had a large
acquaintance with Christian women
who support missions he knew that
they were as good wives and moth
ers and as good housekeepers as their
neighbors who do not touch the mis
sionary enterprise with the tips of
their dainty fingers. Dickens gave
the world a portrait of Chadband
and Pecksniff. But Chadband was not
a typical English clergyman and
Pecksniff was not a typical English
Christian man. Dickens had a pen
chant for creating and describing
freaks, and Mrs. Jellyby was one of
that class. Dickens was a great nov
elist, but could hardly be regarded
an authority on religious matters.
His opinion on missions is not with
out interest from a historical point
of view, but is not decisive with
Christian people.
Christ is the author of the mis
sionary propaganda. He charges his
followers to go into all the world
and preach the gospel to the whole
creation. As the Father sent him
into the world, so he sent them into
the world. He mapped out their
field. They were to begin where
they were and to carry His religion
to the uttermost parts of the earth.
They have no option in the premises.
They have vowed eternal allegiance
to him and they must do what He
commands.
“Theirs not to make reply
Theirs not to reason why,
Theirs but to do and die?’
If one is not a Christian he can re
tuse to do what is in his power to
evangelize the world; but if he is a
Christian he must help Christ give
the gospel to all mankind. This is
the one work that the church was
organized to perform. The mission
of the church is missions.
The Editor of the Jeffersonian is
mistaken as to our Lord’s instruc
tions to His disciples. It was not
when He sent them out into all the
world with the message of salvation
that He told them to “carry neither
scrip nor purse.” That was said
when He sent them on a short tour
through Palestine to announce Ito
their countrymen that the kingdom
of heaven was at hand. They were
sure of hospitality in every city and
village they might enter. He gave
no such command when He sent
them to preach from continent to con
tinent. In the latter case the condi
tions were entirely different. They
could expect nothing from those with
whom they had to do. His command
to take no anxious thought for what
they should eat or drink or wear,
and not to lay up treasures on earth,
but in heaven, was given to the
whole body of believers and not to
the apostles alone. That command
is as binding upon the Christians in
America as it is upon the men and
women out in the far-flung battle
line. In the service of God there is
only one standard of sacrifice and
consecration for all Christians,
wherever they may happen to live
and labor. The Christian in America
who criticises missionaries for not
living up to his conception of that
one standard should qualify himself
to act the critic by first living up to
that standard himself. Otherwise he
will fall under the condemnation of
those who say and do not do.
In the article under review the
author seeks to make the impression
that the simple and heroic stand
ards of the pioneer days are
unknown now; that the mission
aries have a corking time gen
erally; that they are as well or
better off than their supporters at
home. Had the writer visited the
fields and learned of the workers and
their work and the difficulties they
must meet and overcome, he would
have written differently. There is
as much heroism in the lives of most
missionaries now as there was in the
lives of the pioneers. The romance
and glamour are largely gone, but the
heroism remains. The men on the
field are picked men. They are
above the average in point of ability.
For the most part they are men with
university training. They could live
at home and earn much more than
they now receive and have a hun
dred comforts and conveniences
where they have one now. As it
is, they live among an alien race;
they have to master and use a
strange language; they are misunder
stood and distrusted and hated by
the very people they are seeking to
benefit; they labor on while their
children are at home receiving an
education; frequently they do not
see a white face for a year or more.
No man goes to the field thinking
that he can better his condition in
any sense or that he may have a
corking time generally. There are
men who could be earning from five
to fifty thousand dollars a year who
receive a thousand dollars a year
as missionaries. They are there be
cause they believe that God called
them into that particular form of
service, and there is not money
enough in the mints of the nation to
lead them to resign and come home.
They feel that theirs is the tiptop
position in all .the world, not be
cause of their stipend, or because
they have an easy berth, but because
they are where their Lord wishes
them to be, and their joy is com
plete. If the man who thinks they
have a corking good time generally
would go out and help in the work
for a term of years he could change
his views. Colonel Denby, United
States Minister to China, said that
he made it his business to visit all
the missionaries in all the open ports
of that country. He wrote that men
and women who spent their lives
teaching Chinese children on a sal
ary that barely enabled them to live
were heroes and heroines as truly as
Jeffersonian
Grant and Sheridan, as Nelson and
Farragut. Denby said, “Believe no
man who sneers at the missionaries;
the man is simply not posted on
the work.” Denby was writing to
sinners like himself. He was writ
ing as Pliny wrote to Trajan. He
said, “I am a man, and nothing per
taining to human interests is a mat
ter of indifference to me.” This tes
timony is true. It could be corrob
orated most amply were that neces
sary.
The editor makes merry over the
claim for costly wardrobes and much
jewelry lost by missionaries in the
Boxer uprising. It may be that some
missionaries lost expensive clothing
and splendid diamonds; but if they
did, one thing is as clear as daylight,
namely this, they did not pay for
such articles out of their salaries.
If they were possessors of costly
wardrobes and much jewelry, they
either inherited them or they receiv
ed them as gifts from their family
or from their friends. It is not pos
sible that they could have bought
them out of their allowances as mis
sionaries. The average salary for a
man and his wife is about one thou
sand dollars a year. In addition, a
modest home is provided and medi
cal expenses are paid. Living on
most fields is as expensive as at
home. No living man could buy
costly apparel and magnificent jew
els for his wife either in America or
in any mission field on a salary of
one thousand dollars a year. Some
remarks purporting to have been
made in the Senate chamber are
quoted. In a letter from the Acting
Secretary of State, Mr. Huntington
Wilson, dated June 24, 1909, he
writes: “A detailed examination
made by the Department of all Chi
nese claims seems to show that, in
general, the claims of the mission
aries and their wives were not un
reasonably excessive, and, specifical
ly, that there was no claim on ac
count of jewelry or wardrobe large
enough to attract attention.” This
testimony should satisfy all reason
able men. Reference was made in
the article to Judson and other pion
eers. Mrs. Judson was savagely crit
icised in her time for wearing a
very costly cashmere shawl. It de
veloped that the shawl was a gift
from a prosperous man whose chil
dren Mrs. Judson had befriended in
a time of great need.
The editor would have his readers
believe that our Lord would have
missionaries preach and do nothing
else. He insists that preach means
preach. He condemns the use of hos
pitals and schools and the press as
missionary agencies. Jesus did
charge His disciples to preach the
gospel to the whole human race.
There can be no doubt as to that.
Preaching was their chief business.
But it is clear that whatever was re
quired to make their preaching effec
tive was not forbidden. They were at
liberty to use whatever would help
them in their work. Jesus was a
preacher, but He spent as much time
in healing the sick as He did in
preaching. He went about all the
cities and villages, teaching in their
synagogues, and preaching the gos
pel of the Kingdom, and healing all
manner of disease and all manner
of sickness. When He sent out the
twelve on their first tour He bade
them preach the gospel, heal the sick,
raise the dead, cleanse the lepers,
and cast out demons. We know that
the apostles, under the guidance of
the Holy Spirit, ministered to body
and soul. Peter and John healed the
lame beggar at the gate called Beau
tiful. The sick and those vexed with
unclean spirits were carried into the
streets of Jerusalem that Peter’s
shadow might fall on some of them.
The record says that they were heal
ed, every one. The miraculous cures
of that time were revelations of the
love and saving grace and power of
God. They called attention to the
joyful message of salvation and dis
posed the people to accept it. We
know that such was the fact.
The hospital and the dispensary do
for the missionary what the power to
work miracles did for our Lord and
his apostles and their associates. The
medical missionary has all the re
sources of modern science; these are
God’s gifts and are to be used for
the benefit of His children. The med
ical work attracts the people and
prepares for the preaching of the
evangelist. Every employee in the
hospital makes it his first concern to
pass on the good news. Nowhere
can such miscellaneous crowds be
preached to regularly as in the wait
ing-rooms of the dispensary. Many
are reached there who would never
hear the gospel in any other way.
Those who are admitted to the hos
pital have unique opportunities of
hearing and receiving systematic in
struction in Christian truth. The
•hospital and dispensary are object
lessons of Christian love and mercy.
They are a practical exemplification
of the parable of the Good Samari
tan. The people say, “It must be a
good doctrine that produces such
good deeds.”
Dr. Parker opened China at the
point of a lancet. “His remarkable
cures awakened feelings of wonder,
admiration, gratitude, trust and
deep devotion. Morning by morn
ing approaches to the hospital were
crowded with patients coming for aid;
some of them, in their eagerness, ris
ing at midnight, others spreading
their mats the previous evening and
sleeping by the threshold, that they
might be more certain of early ad
mission.” Dr. Parker made the lame
to walk and the blind to see. His
cures were pronounced miracles, and
his fame was carried through the
eighteen provinces. He found grateful
patients receptive of his gospel teach
ings. Thus the cures effected in
three months did more to break down
Chinese prejudice and hostility than
could have been accomplished by
years of customary missionary work.
Di. Parker gained friends from every
tank and from near and distant prov
inces. Dr. Post, of Syria, tells how
sick people from Palestine, from Bag
dad, from the Great Sahara, from
Turkestan, from the headwaters of
the Euphrates and the Tigris, from
