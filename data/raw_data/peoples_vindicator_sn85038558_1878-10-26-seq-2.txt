DISCIFIl.E.
The Democratic party is a disci
plined army. It recognizes no man
that does not yield obedience to the
monnlates of the lmajoritl. What iQ
decided by that majority, if he he
Democrat, he must obey. The voter
who will not so yield to party disci
pline is, in this country, a dangerous
foe to our institutions.
It is well enough to look back to
the old days and to read of what
fine times there are at elections in
the North. Such is all very well.
Before the war here, as it is in the
North now, all were white men
equally interested in rood laws, low
taxation and honest government.
We have no such condition of affairs
now. A voting population, totally
ignorant of their duties, full of bit
ter prejudice and of a lower race,
have been suddenly advanced to citi
zenship. The eight years rule of
that class in the parish is reason
enough, argument enough, to convince
any reasoning mind, that the white
man cannot afford to divide--that
discipline must be maintained in our
ranks at all hazards.
Every "Independent" candidate is
an insult to discipline; a disorgani
zer, and should he stamped out. No
man has any right to jeopardize the
welfare of this community that he
may gratify a personal spite, or ad
vance his selfish ends.
Let all good men unite to promote
harmony, for that is essential to suc
cess.
While brave men are being assas
sinated, as Mr. Johnson was on Sat
urday night last we find a lot of
wretches endeavoring to run them
selves into office upon tihe precious
blood of martyrs in the cause of free
dom from negro rule. Have xFrr, and
when we say fMEN we speak of those
whom we know and honor as such,
candidateh
that our eAnd that candidate thought
ding blfravest and best are shed
g. ,od and giving up life for
which are eternal.
re now be a stop put to all
such tIi us hallow the memory
of son) as Jo and cherish the
friendship of n aso Atkinson,
who did their duty for ta race and
civilization. Let every goo man
silence the whinining of any "1
who will not stand up in support
of a cause for which these gallant
men bled. Out upon the coward who
would profit by such sacrifices,as
these; they desire nothing better
than Blunt's fate and should receive
it.

Citizens, as the French say, you
are now making history.
You are showing other parishes
how radicali-ti can he throttled in an
hour. You were first in 1I74, you
are first in 18T.
Shall it be said that von killed rad
icalism on a bhight September Sat
urday and (dimmed your victory with
the indelible stain of scratching a
ticket or skulking from the polls. ,
Let your devotion to the cause of
honest government be marked in
your majority. Those who hate cor- r
rapt government and labor for its
success need fear no oblivion. They
will be heralded to ages as examples
worthy of honorable imitation, while
the'parasites of corrupt power, who
have lived without virtue and died
without repentance, will have neither
script, nor picture, norn marble, only
the universal detestation of mankind
to embalm their infamy !

. The idea of a man claiming to be a
Democrat and running against the
r nominee of his party is simply pre
posterous. If he is a Democrat his
duty is to work and vote for his par
ty, not to attempt to disorganize the
o whites and turn his people over to
t the bad negroes and worse white men.
n And that is exactly what Mr. Grappe
is doing. There is no more chance
e for him to be elected, tihan there is
, for him to fly, consequently every
v vote cast for hinm aids Boullt.
If Grappe does not see artdkunow
this, theni he is a fool, atnd totally in

and if he does know it, lie is a bad

LET THE FUNERAL PRIOCEISSION
PROCEED--"The Democracy did not
beat us, any way," is the consolation
of a Republican journal at the result
of the Maine election. It seems to
think that defeat at the hands of the
Nationals more endurable than at the
hands of the Democracy. Perhaps
that is so. There is no accounting
at all times for the eccentricities of I
human nature. If Republicans prefer
death at the hands of the Nationals, a
far more radical organization than
that of the Democratic party, than at
the hands of the I)emocracy. all we
have to say is, let the funeral proces
sion proceed.-[Cincinnati Enquirer.
