THE JEFFERSONIAN MAGA
ZINE AS A CHRISTMAS
GIFT.
Spring-field, Mo., Dec. 21, 1908.
Mr. Thomas E. Watson, Atlanta, Ga.
Dear Friend: We have read your
publications so long and valued them
so highly that we think we can send
no finer Christmas gifts to our two
boys than your fine Magazine for a
year; they will appreciate them as
the best they could receive from
father and mother. They are both
great readers and deep thinkers, and
want to learn what is best for them
selves and their fellow man. Allow
me to compliment you upon your
speech of acceptance last summer;
it surpassed any I ever read in my
life; and I have been reading them
for thirty-five years, have many good
speeches on file, but yours beats
them all —will keep it long as I live.
Times are brightening up a little
here now. The fool people will con
tinue to vote the old party tickets;
then whine about hard times. I tell
them they have it in their power to
make it better if they would; but
they show more ignorance in that
than in anything else.
One of the greatest desires of my
life is to see you President of this
grand United States. My happiness
would be complete, my children’s fu
ture would be assured, then. They are
well educated and good, steady young
men, and their success lies in doing
and voting right; for which I have
taught them.
I send you Christmas greeting;
peace on earth, good will to men.
May your life be spared for many
a Christmas to come; for the good
you are doing by your able pen.
I will close with the best wishes of
your true friends,
MARY & JAMES SMALLEY.
MONEY QUESTION PARAMOUNT.
Adel, Ga., Nov. 5, 1908.
Gentlemen: I feel that the cause
of the farmer, his relief from the op
pression he now suffers, his future
freedom or slavery, is almost wholly
dependent on such works as The
Jeffersonians and such men as Thos.
E. Watson.
There is no Watson club here, and
I hardly think one could be success
fully organized. I believe the best
work we can do here for the next
two years will be to push the money
question before the Farmers’ Union.
As a member of the Farmers’ Union,
I have found that this is the one
question of legislation that appeals
most to them —the great rank and
file. They can see into this some
what, and are beginning to realize
that they are powerless to demand
and obtain any definite living price
for their produce so long as our Na
tional Government by act of law
to one exclusive class (national
bankers) a monopoly on money and
the power to “corner” it. Let us
either fight the national banks and
demand that the government take
this function of issuing money away
from them and issue it direct itself
on equal basis to all industries or
classes, or cease to fight the national
banks and contend for the govern
ment to loan money to all of us that
can put up safe collateral just as it
does now, in substance, to its one pet,
the national bank. I rather believe
this last course best —will make less
enemies to fight, and appeal to State
banks, and other such institutions, in
a friendly and business way just at
this time, when they just last fall
came so near being put in the same
hole with the farmer by this “pet”
money monopoly, so that they had to
resort to the underlying principles of
the old Alliance sub-treasury plan to
save themselves, and thus admit all
the substance of its argument in the
issue of certificates.
Yours truly,
W. D. WELLS.
To the Populists of Laurens County.
The power to corrupt by hate is
now a fixed principle of the Hamil
tonian Democracy of the South. The
law-making power and the courts are
in their hands. They control the
voting, and the elections must go their
way, though you poll two to their one.
The broad field of the South is their
plantation by mortgage. The South
ern people are their laborers. No
laws can be made without their con
sent, none can be enforced without
their consent.
The prices of all things are fixed by
them, what you buy, and what you
sell. This was the intended doom for
the South, by the leaders of the war
of the North upon the South in 1861-
65 in case they should be able to over
throw the American liberties, which
they succeeded in doing, and set up
an imperial government over the once
sovereign States of the old Republic.
Now we say to you that, at an early
date probably, there will be a
mass meeting called of more than ex
traordinary interest, and from now
until then rest upon your oars of
honor, and be sure to meet on that
day.
POPULISTS OF LAURENS CO.
< ‘ FEWER BLISTERS!, MORE POUL
TICES.”
Hephzibah, Ga., Dec. 17, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson: I read in your
Jeffersonian of December 3rd a piece
headed, “Remember the Old Folks.”
I enjoyed reading it very much; so
timely, and appropriate, so true. I
always enjoy your writings, and es
pecially when you write on such sub
jects. I earnestly wish you would
write more on such themes, subjects
that appeal to the sympathy of men.
Apply less blisters and more poultices,
and you will be loved more by the good
Christian people of our grand old
country.
Mr. Watson, don’t understand me
to be criticising your writing, for I
am not. You are a man that I esteem
above all public men. I have an ad
miration for you that will linger with
TSfoft ‘Seffersontan
life. You are doing a grand work,
and I hope the masses will soon un
derstand you better, and you will be
spared to see your cause triumph.
Give us a good piece next week for
Christmas, “on a Christian theme.”
I know you can if you will slightly
try, from your brilliant storehouse
of knowledge. I have enjoyed your
piece on “Remember the Old
Folks” so that I have sent a copy to
The Augusta Chronicle and Wesleyan
Christian Advocate to copy. The
Wesleyan copied your piece last
March I sent them on “Strong
Drink. ’ ’
With best wishes for your health
and happiness, I am sincerely yours,
R. E. MELTON.

WANTSi UNITED REFORM
PARTY.
Albia, lowa, Nov. 26, 1908.
Dear Mr. Watson: All other po
litical parties copied largely from the
People’s Party platform this year,
and it is consoling to know these
facts. It certainly is a lack of intelli
gence to maintain and keep up four
or five separate reform organiza
tions, there is no more sense in keep
ing up so many organizations than
there is in having four or five wheels
to a wheelbarrow, when one united
organization could do great good and
accomplish something for the ‘com
mon people now. United we stand,
divided we fall.
I can see no reason why we should
not try to perfect a strong, united
political party, taking as a basis the
initiative, referendum and recall,
with postal savings banks and public
ownership of public utilities, as its
platform.
All reform factions could unite
upon such a platform, then when in
power they could add other neces
sary reform measures.
Respectfully,
J. R. NORMAN,
Populist State Chairman.
SYSTEMATIC ORGANIZATION A
TRUMP CARD.
Jacksonville, Fla., Nov. 14, 1908.
Mr. Thos. E. Watson.
My Dear Sir: Seeing the results
of November 3rd, also a few criti
cisms of some of the Georgia papers,
I am today and henceforth your
friend, and will support your Jeffer
sonians so long as I am financially
able. I have been a Democrat and
voted their’ ticket for forty years,
but am pleased to feel that I did not
vote for the “social equality” hire
ling in this past glorious failure of
his. He has, as you know, run
Democracy out of existence and be
come the henchman of his bosses
(Plutocrats). Has he enough com
mon sense to realize he is not want
ed? Hope he has. I have read the
Jeffersonians for past year and pass
them to others. My idea is for you
to call a convention of representa
tive Populists of the United States
within the next eight months and
organize national, State, county and
district organizations and push the
work for county and State officers,
and four years hence go in to win in
a national campaign. Systematic
organization is the strongest trump
we can play in any business.
Best wishes for the cause in any
way you may choose.
Your friend,
NEMO.
UNFAIR DEALING IN ARKAN
SAS.
Hope, Ark., Nov. 16, 1908.
My Dear Mr. Watson : Not a word
has been said in any of the papers
about anybody’s receiving a vote,
except Bryan and Taft, and to my
own personal knowledge there were
several hundred votes cast in this,
Hempstead county, for the Hon. T.
E. Watson.
We managed to get out an elec
toral ticket with two electors on it.
the Hon. A. W. Files, of Little Rock,
and Mr. H. N. Segler, of White
county. It is a fact, under our pres
ent system of balloting there is no
possible chance of ever having an
other fair election in this county or
the State. When the judges of the
election are disposed to perpetrate
fraud, it is not only practiced in the
general election, but it is practiced
in our Democratic primaries to a
shameful degree.
The question is, how much longer
will the people tolerate it?
Respectfully,
S. J. WIGGINS.
EMPHATICALLY NOT DISCOUR
AGED.
‘Sycamore, Ga., Nov. 14, 1908.
Hon. T. E. Watson.
Dear Sir: In 1904 the “Pops”
voted 42 at this precinct and the
Democrats voted 84. This time we
“Pops” voted 39 and the Dems 57,
which shows how the wind is blow
ing in this neck of the wiregrass.
Discouraged, indeed! Just as well
talk of going back into the service
of the devil because Christ died!
Os course, a large per cent of men
are like swine. If they have what
they deem a measure of prosperity,
at intervals, they are satisfied.
If you will send me some samples
of the Jeffersonians, I will distribute
them and try to get subscribers.
In the cause,
J. T. DICKEY, M. D.
FROM A SCHOOL GIRL.
Crest, Ga., Dec. 17, 1908.
Dear Mr. Watson: I will write to
you thanking you very much for the
book, which contains a variety of
your speeches and things which hap
pened during your early times of
life, which words are inexpressible
for the gratification due unto you
from me.
I am not your namesake, but really
I think should have been if I were
a boy. I certainly do like to read
my book. Father and all the family
