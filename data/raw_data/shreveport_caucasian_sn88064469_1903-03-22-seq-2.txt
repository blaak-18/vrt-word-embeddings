FOR GOOD ROADS.
B. W. Richardson Principal Speaker a.
the First Session.
Dallas, March 20.-The Good Roads
convention was called to order at the
Commercial club. O. P. Bowser of Dal
las was chosen temporary chairman
and John G. Hunter temporary secre
tary. The inclement weather mili
tated against the large attendance ex
pected, but there was nevertheless a
goodly number of delegates.
R. W. Richardson of St. Louis, sec
retary of the National Good Roads as
sociation, made an address that was
listened to with marked attention. Mr.
Richardson spoke of the necessity of
first-class roads and urged those pres
ent to inaugurate the move for good
highways at once.
MRS. HULL NOT SICK.
Attorney Hartsell Declares the Rumor
Is Utterly False.
Buffalo, N. Y., March 20.--Lwyer Al
bert H. Hartsell, counsel for Mrs. Hull,
mother of Mrs. Burdick, was seen with
reference to the reported injury or ill
ness of Mrs. Hull. He said: "Mrs.
Hull is in her usual health. She has
not been hurt or injured. I was at
her house about 8 o'clock Wednesday
night, and she was all right. This
story of hurts Gi injury is absolutely
false. A man named Allen, at the
house, is stationed there with Instruc
tions to refuse information."
The report concerning Mrs. Hull was
current Wednesday night. Inquirers
ta the Burdick home were met by a
young man by the name of Allen, who
refused to confirm or deny the rumors
further than to say that Mrs. Hull was
weakening under the nervous strain to
which she has been subjected since the
murder of Mr. Burdick.
RARE OPERATION.
Upper Right Extremity of a Little Child
Is Amputated.
Pittsburg, Pa., March 20.-Surgeons
at the Mercy hospital here amputated
the complete right upper extremity of
achild two years old. The amputation
included, besides the arms, the collar
bone and shoulder blade. It took al
most an hour and a half. A malignant
growth of the shoulder, infecting the
whole upper extremity and which soon
would have infected the whole body
and caused death, made the operation
necessary. Only once before has the
operation been attempted on a child
tio years old, and the patient died.
The chil, stood the operation well and
it is thought she will kecover.

GOLD GONE.
A Bar Valued at Many Thousand Dollars
Is Reported Missing.
Detroit, Mich, March 20.-A bar of
gold, said to be valued at $20,000 to
$23,000, disappeared from the express
car of Wabash train No. 4, which ar
rive I from the west at 8 o'clock Wed
nesday night and left for Buffalo at
midnight. The property was in charge
of the Pacific Express company, and
consigned to Buffalo. As soon as the
messenger missed the gold, he notified
the local express agent of the compa
ny, who in turn asked the police to as
sist in the search for the missing
treasure. Every available detective on
the staff of Chief of Detectives Mc
Daniel was assigned the case and
private detectives wer also retained to
assist. Local officials say there is a
bare possibility that the bar has been
misplaced and will turn up in Buffa
lo. "We are impatiently waiting for
news from Buffalo," said the manager
of the local branch of the Pacific Ex
press company.
ARKANSAS CITY.
Citizens Have Made a Noble With Fair
Success
New Orleans, March 20.-A special
to the Picayune from Arkansas City,
Ark., says: Your correspondent return
ed from Medford and Red Fork, on the
Arkansas river, where he went on
board the government steamer Vidette,
whose mission was to carry 10,000
sacks to be used by the Red Fork levee
board in holding intact the Arkansas
river levee from Pendleton south.
Citizens along the line have made a
noble fight and now have the situation
well in hand. These levees along their
line are in very good condition, and
with a falling river will give them but
little more trouble, unless heavy rains
should occur along the upper Arkansas
during the next few days.
Planters say they each have over 100
bales of cotton yet in the fields un
picked, and they expect to have hands
picking cotton in one part of the fields
this spring while the seed is being
planted in another part. The Arkansas
river has shown a fall of over two
tenths at Medford and is on a stand at
Red Fork. The condition along the
Mississippi river levees in this district
is not materially changed. Everything
is reported as being in good shape, and
little seepage water seems to be com
ing through for the extreme high stage
of water. The line of levees is being
patrolled by well organized guards.
The government gauge at this point
registered 51.20, showing a rise of .04
during the past twenty-four hours.
The highest stage at Arkansas City
may reach fifty-two feet or a fraction
over.
YOUNG SPOKE.
He Devoted Almost the Entire Day to
Defense of Merger Interests.
St. Louis, March 20.-Almost the en
tire session of the United States court
of the district of Minnesota, before
which the case of the United States
government against the Northern Se
curities company is being tried, was
occupied by former Judge Geo. B.
Young, in defense of the merger in
terests. Judge Young was followed by
M. D. Grover of St. Paul, also counsel
for the defense.
Later former Attorney General
Griggs informed the Associated Press
that in order to facilitate the hearing
of the Northern Securities company
case, it had been decided by the coun
sel for the defendants not to read in
court a brief prepared by Daniel Wil
cox and signed by him and by Francis
Lynde Stetson in behalf of J. P. Mor
gan. Robert Bacon and Daniel F. La
mont, and that copies had been given
to all concerned in the case, which was
done.
Argument Concluded
St. Louis, Mo., March 20.-Argu
ments in behalf of the Wabash road
were concluded Thursday in the in
Junction suit and the first statement
in behalf of the men by F. N. Judson
of St. Louis was unfinished when
court adjourned for the day. No re
striction has been placed by Judge
Adams upon the duration of argu
ments and the attorneys will be given
ample time for exhaustive discussion.
Another Chapter.
Washington, aMrch 20.-Minister
Bowen wrote a note to Sir Michael
Herbert, British ambassador, telling
him that rumors had been current that
the powers are not disposed to send'
the question of preferential treatment
in the Venezuelan matter to The
Hague tribunal. Mr. Bowen does not
think that Venezuela should be bound
to pay the thirty per cent provided
for in the protocol of February 13 if
The Hague protocol is not signed be
fore' April 1st. and took this position
in the note to Sir Michael Herbert.
The plan of Mr. Bowen, it is believed
here, will bring the whole question to
an issue promptly and terminate the
indecision which now apparently ob
tains as to just what the intentions of
the various allied governments are in
the matter of settling their claims.

WARWHOOP .ND UMBRELLA
A Combination That Saved a Mls
sionary From a Tiger.
Dr. Chamberlain, in his entertaining
story of "'The Cobra's Den," tells of an
experience in India which the reader
will scarcely envy. He says:
It was just one hour before sundown
of a cloudy. drizzly afternoon. I had
my double umbrella, black inside and
white outside, for fending off both sun
and rain, but had closed it over my
hand, without clasping it, to go through
a narrow opening in the bushes. I had
crossed a little open grass plot of a few
rods and was just entering a narrow
footpath through the mountain jungle
that would take me down to the east
foot of the mountain, where I was to
meet my pony.
Suddenly a spotted tiger sprang into
the path between the bushes and dis
puted the passage. I saw at once what
he wanted-only great hunger impels
these tigers to come out during the day
-he had eaten lie breakfast and want
ed missionary meat for supper. I did
not wish hlim to have it. Besides, I had
an appointment for that evening with
the people of three villages and wished
to keep it. He stood in the only path
through that dense mountain jungle,
glaring at me. I eyed him equally in
tently, and, gaining his eye, held it
while I formed my plan.
It is always best, if a scrimmage is
to take place, to be the attacking party.
My old grandmother used to teach me
that everything would come in use
within seven years if you only kept it.
When I was a boy, I had gone out
among an Indian tribe in Michigan and
learned their warwhoop. I had kept it
for thrice seven years, but it proved
trebly serviceable then. When my
plan of attack was formed, springing
toward the tiger, I raised this war
whoop and at the same time suddenly
opened my double umbrella.
What it was that could so suddenly
change a perpendicular dark figure in
to a circular white object and at the
same time emit such an unearthly yell
the tiger did not "know. He stood his
ground, however, until I dashed for
ward and, suddenly shutting my um
brella, raised it to strike him over the
head. It seemed instantly to occur to
him that I was the more dangerous an
imal of the two and that one of us had
better run. As I did not, he did. Spring
ing aside, over a bush, into the open
ground, he made for the crest of the
hill which I had just passed.
Lincoln at Play.
It is natural to find that Lineoln, the
most American of all Americans, should
have played the most national of all
our games, baseball. An old neighbor
of Lincoln's, who is now a switchman
in an Indiana town, remembers how
Lincoln played "the great game." His
name is Rooney, and his story, as. the
Cincinnati Commercial Tribune tells
it, gives a hearty account of the man
who even as president was ready to
unbend to trivial amusements.
When Lincoln was practicing law
in Springfield, he lived a few doors
from Rooney, who used to wrestle with
him. Whenever Lincoln saw a chance
for a game of ball, he rushed out of his
ofice, with his tall silk hat and long
tailed coat, and joined the sport.
During the wrestling match that of
ten followed-wrestling was Lincoln's
favorite sport-Lincoln's hat, coat, cra
vat and braces hung on the fence.
His tall hat was a target for the ball,
and many a silk tile was ruined by the
players. In reaching for balls Lincoln's
long arms did good service. He played
the game as he played all games-with
all his might.
Modern Carthage.
For the first time in many centuries
something modern has appeared on the
site of the ancient city of Carthage.
Here, where once flourished the arts of
war and peace, is a vast, lonely plain.
Of the streets through which the con
quering Hannibal marched in triumph
nothing now remains but the shadeless
wheatflelds. Popular Mechanics de
scribes the stalking camel plodding
along, drawing the modern American
plow or cultivator.
The soil is as rich as it was on the
day when the Phoenicians founded the
city, and the American and his indus
tries have found their way to the his
toric spot where the Romans wrought
such devastation in their conquests.
Americans. in charge of native work
men, may be seen directing the use of
the modern farming implements in
harvesting or tilling the soil. These
machines are a source of wonder to the
natives, who for generations employed
only the crudest of farm implements.
The place is on the northern coast of
Africa, about ten miles from the pres
ent city of. Tunis. Americans find the
market there for their inventions a
lucrative one.
Boston's Low Birth Rate.
Not since 1894 have so few children
been born in Boston. In 1901 the birth
rate was only 27.10. During the year
there was an actual gain in population
of only 4,275. The proportion of na
tive whites of native parentage is now
only 30 per cent of the whole popula
tion, and many of these are but two re
moves from an immigrant ancestry. It
is very evident that the old American
stock is dying out and that it will in
evitably be replaced by the newcomers
of the end of the nineteenth century
and the beginning of the twentieth.
The foreign born element constitutes
about one-third of the population, but
contributed about two-thirds of the
births. Among the Italians there were
1,411 births, among the Russians 1,337
and among the Irish 3,591.
The highest birth rates in the city are
found in those wards where live the
poor and the foreigners. The lowest
bfrth rates are found in the Back Bay
