Binghamton, N. Y.—Tammany Hall
was bitterly attacked by Superinten
dent Anderson of the Anti-Saloon
League, in a speech delivered . here
before the men’s organization of the
North Presbyterian church, in which
he said that the “politico-ecclesias
tical combinations of Tammany and
the Catholic church were intent upon
discrediting the Ku Klux Klan as an
un-American institution.” He de
clared that the acts of Tammany Hall
tended to increase membership in
the Klan and that if he was brought
to trial before election it will be the
last desperate card of the anti-pro
hibition interests.
Hie Foreign Masters
“If I am brought to trial before
election in an effort to secure a ver
dict of guilty from a jury composed
of men formerly in the liquor business
or hangers-on of that business (of
course, purely through the accident
of drawing), which jury is fixed or
tampered with by representatives of
this Tammany politiao-ecclesiastical
combination, it will be thoroughly un-
derstood that it is the last desperate
card being played by his bunch in
their effort to elect a Tammany as-
sembly that will do things that may
put the entire state at the mercy of
Tammany and its real foreign
masters for a generation.
“This New York district attorney
claims to be a Protestant, holds mem
bership in a reputable Protestant
church whose pastor he evidently
compelled to come to his feeble de
fense, and yet he is doing the dirty
work of the anti-Protestaiit gang
that is working through Tammany’s
control and prostitution of the ma
chinery gf justice. This Tammany
district attorney is high in Masonic
circles, and yet he allows himself to
be made in this matter the mere tool
and cat’s paw of the anti-Masonic in
fluences that are trying to tear down
most of what Masonry stands for. The
New York district attorney’s ally in
this unsavory business is the Rocke
feller representative who, as a federal
official during the world war, double
crossed the Masons to advance the
Knights of Columbus.
Trying to Destroy Schools
“This same politico-ecclesiastical
combination that is trying to destroy
the public schools that taught the ef
fect of alcohol, and that is trying to
cripple the Protestant churches by
disrupting their Anti-Saloon League
agency following the blow at the
churches by the vicious Knights of
Columbus propaganda against the
Young Men’s Christian association,
is walking the echoes with its pro
tests against the KU Klux Klan on
the ground that it is an un-American
institution.
“I know absolutely nothing about
the Ku Klux Klan from the inside,
for I have never been, am not and
never shall be a member. But it
does not take more than one eye, and
that not wide open, to see that most
of the enemies of the Ku Klux Klan
are mainly the enemies of the Prot
estant churches and of prohibition,
of the public school, and of the
American constitution generally.
Propaganda Against Y. M. C. A.
“I do not approve of lawlessness,
whether committed by Klan members
or anybody else. I think the Klan
will probably some day recognize the

need of taking due steps to protect
itself against representatives of this
politico-ecclesiastical outfit putting on
hoods and robes themselves and com
mitting crimes for the purpose of
having • them charged to the Klan.
Organizations like Tammany and the
anti-Protestant politico-ecclesiastical
combination behind it are doing more
to recruit the Klan at the present
time than anything else. And aside
from the public school question, things
like the Knights of Columbus propa
ganda against the Young Men’s
Christian Association as a blow at
the Protestant churches, and now the
attempt to disrupt the Ani-Saloon
League as the agency of these
churches by discrediting and ruining
iss officials, seem destined to obtain
for the Klan a church backing of a
sort that would otherwise have been
impossible.
Voices Preference For Klan
“And further, notwithstanding the
falsehoods already uttered and cer
tain to be uttered to the effect that
I have endorsed he Klan, I have no
hesitation in saying that as between
Tammany and the so-called religious
influences behind it on one hand and
the Klan on the other, I infinitely pre
fer the Klan without knowing a thing
about it.”
The church was crowded to capac
ity to hear the speaker who has been
in the limelight through the efforts
of certain interests to indict him and
his leadership of the dry intedests in

Six Persons Who Can Neither Read

Schools.
—K-K-K
Crowley, La—A few weeks ago
the public spirited citizens of this city
endeavored to raise the school levy a
small amount to secure some very ne
cessary funds for certain improve
ments. Catholics defeated the pur
pose of the Protestants who wished
ti improve the schools. Since that
time a survey of the names has been
made to learn the class of persons
who signed petitions to defeat the
securing of funds to aid the schools
Among the first twelve persons shown
as signing the petition there were six
that had to make their marks as they
could not write.
Following are the twelve names
that headed the petition and will
give the young American who is
looking to the public school for his
education, an idea of the kind of per
sons who would ruin the schools that
have made America the greatest
country on earth:

LEGION RESENTS THE
LAXITY OF CEMETERY
—K-K-K
“Poor Box” Is Kept at Gate in France
and Conditions Are Deplorable,
Says Spafford.
—K-K-K
New York.—An investigation of
what he says are the deplorable con
ditions of the American Military
Cemetery of Belleau Wood. France,
will be demanded of Congress, Ed
ward E. Spafford, New York state
commander of the American Legion,
said recently.
Commander Spafford expressed in
dignation that a “poor box” is kept
at the entrance to the cemetery for
solicitation of funds from foreign and
American visitors to maintain the
grounds where 2,170 American sol
diers and marines are sleeping.
The Legion commander’s state
ment was based upon a dispatch to
an afternoon newspaper from Paris
describing the state of the cemetery
as pitiable because appropriations of
Congress were insufficient. It said
officials of the Graves Registration
Service in Fran'ce knew nothing of
the “poor box” and thought it might
be a device of French laborers to
extract tips.
Ground Is Bare
The Paris dispatch quoted Ameri
can visitors to the cemetery as say
ing that the ground was bare and
resembles the foundations construc
tion of a New York skyscraper.
Expressing gratitude that the con
dition had been revealed, Comman
der Spafford said the Legion would
demand punishment “of every Amer
ican who has been guilty of neglect
of duty.” He said the Legion had
been promised that the cemetery
would be placed in perfect condition
last summer.

ARKANSAS KLANSMEN MEET AT
DANVILLE
•
Harkey Klan Number 43, Realm of
Arkansas, held a barbecue and initia
tion just across the Petit Jean River
from Danville last week with rep
resentatives from dozens of Klans in
the Western part of Arkansas in
attendance.
This Klan has made Yell County a
better place in which to live and its
membership is growing rapidly.
Moonshiners have vanished, most of
them being in the penitentiary, and
church attendance has increased.
After the initiation at Danville pa
triotic addresses on Klan principles
were delivered by several speakers.
AMERICANIZATION IS BADLY
Some conception of the magnitude
of the Americanization program that
must be undertaken by the Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan if the principles of
America’s forefathers are to be re
established may be obtained from a
census of Chicago just made by the
Association of Commerce.
This census shows that Chicago is
only 28 per cent American, in the
strictest sense of the word.
Seventy-two per cent of the popu
lation —1,947,376 persons of 2,701,705
—are of foreign birth or parentage,
only 752,329 residents of Chicago
were born in the United of
American parents.
Of the 752,329 Americans in the city
109,458 are negroes. Subtraction of
that group leaves a total white
American population of only 642,871
or less than 25 per cent of the whole
population of 2,701,705.

the presence of Imperial Wizard Dr.

AMERICA FIRST
NEEDED HERE
PROPAGANDA NOW
CLUTCHES MOVIES
Roman Catholic propaganda is
being spread through the country by
motion picture stars who have organ*
ized themselves into the Catholic Mo*
tion Picture Actor’s Guild. Hundreds
of thousands of Protestant children
who view our movies weekly and
whose minds are in the formative
stage will be given sugar coated
doses of Catholicism and what it
stands* for in the way of opposition
to the public school and the placing
of church over state.
Already the leaven is being felt.
In one film now going the rounds the
United States mail service, a service
which every American admires, is
featured. The film shows every char
acter as an Irish Catholic, the intima
tion being that the acme of effi
ciency in this service could only be
reached through those of this parti
cular nationality and religious belief
and that Protestants would make a
fizzle of the job.
Other stuff of this sort may be
expected through the agency of the
Catholic Motion Picture Actors’ Guild.
Los Angeles papers tell of the recent
meeting of the guild at St. Thomas’s
church with Father M. J. Mullins
presiding.
Thomas Meighan was elected presi
dent; Jack Coogan, Sr., vice president;
T. J. Gray, second vice president
May McAvoy, third vice president;
Ben Turpin, fourth vice president;
Eddie Boland, secretary, and Mary
O’Conflor, treasurer. Mrs. Emmett
Corrigan, Collen Moore, George
Siegman, Frank Keenan, J. J. Franz
and John Considue, compose the exe
cutive committee.
The guild has opened headquarters
in Los Angeles and Protestants will
do well to keep their eyes open for
“touches.” The organization had five
hundred movie actors and actresses
in attendance at the last meeting.

MEMORALIZING MR. HARDING
President Coolidge and members of
the cabinet have under active consid
eration a movement to rear a suit
able memorial to the late Warren G,
Harding. It is not quite clear from
the brief dispatches that have come
to Minneapolis whether it is pro
posed that the government shall have
part in providing the funds or wheth
er the money shall be raised entirely
through voluntary offerings by the
people.
In a very unusual way President
Harding drew to himself the per
sonal affection of the people whom
he served. eMn differed from him in
politics and policies, but it can al
most be said that no man who met
and talked to him face to face or
came within the radius of his charm
of personality went away without a
kindly feeling for him. It is pecu
liarly fitting that a national me
morial to such a man should be one
made possible with a fund raised en
tirely by the willing gifts of men,
women and children of America, ac
cording to their ability or their im
pulse to give.
The Lincoln monument in Spring
field, 111., is maintained by the state
of Illinois, but the money for its
building was obtained by popular
subscription. The Grant monument
in New York was made possible with
funds raised in this way, and so with
memorials to other presidents. It is
right that there should be in Wash
ington a qommemoration of Mr.
Harding provided by the government
in some form or other, but the me
morial which is to stand for the per
sonal love and affection of the people
for a fine man and a leader of ex
alted character should be a gift of
the people. It should represent the
democracy of the people in their pri
vate capacity, thus symbolizing in the
s>est way the broad, sympathetic hu
man spirit of Warren G. Harding.—

HIS UST WORDS
What were his last words? What
were his last words; are questions
asked by millions of people as- the
sad story is read to them of the
death of some loved one. History,
says the Lo* Angeles Record, records
many notorious words and then it
proceeds to add the last words of
many drivers of automobiles. ’Here
are some of them:
“I can beat that train to the cross
ing.”
*‘l always take this curve at 45
miles an hour.”
“I'll take the right of way—he’ll
slow down.”
“Fog doesn't bother mer. I know
every inch of this road.”
“Let me show you how fast this
car will go.”
“Light a match and see how much
gas there is in the tank.”
“I’m going to have my brakes re
lined tomorrow.”
“Watch me dodge between those
two fellows.”
“This is good stuff. The bootleg
ger is a friend of mine.”

HYPHENATED GANG
INSULTS LLOYD GEORGE
—K-K-K
Brilliant Guest of America Is Quick
to Realize Rowdies Were
Not Americans
—K-K-K
New York.—While thousands of
citizens most cordially received Lloyd
George and his family last week as
the guest of the nation, notwithstand
ing the informality of his visit to
this country, a small band of Irish
agitators came down from the head
quarters of the American Associa
tion for the Recognition of Irish
Freedom and started a single file pro
cession from the Municipal building
£}ong the eastern margin of City Hall
park, in full view of 10,000 persons
who liad assembled to witness the
visit of the distinguished Welshman
to the mayor’s office. All the parad
ers were dressed in black and carried
banners derogatory to Lloyd George
and the English.
A squad of policemen intercepted
the marchers, took away their ban
ners of insulting epithets and de
stroyed them on the spot.
When the Lloyd George procession
reachel Duane street on the march up
Lafayette toward the Waldorf-Astoria
several scores of men and women,
largely women and palpably Irish,
were standing with banners, on which
were printed such lines as “Turn
Out De Valera’* and “To Hell With
You.”
As Mr. Lloyd George’s automobile
came abreast of this crowd it surged
toward the vehicle, uttering boos and
shaking fists so fiercely that the
mounted policemen considered it
necessary to force them back, and
then they shook their fists and booed
at the police. . *
Lloyd George, who has had an ex
tended experience with the “Irish
question,” was quick to realise that
the discourteous display was not the
act of American citizens, but was the
outburst of hyphenated Irish-Ameri
cans who would be “agin the govern
ment” no matter on which side of the
Atlantic they might happen to be. y

bers came from Wilmington, congest

The feature of the evening was the
presentation of an American flag and
a lofty pole to the Newport school
