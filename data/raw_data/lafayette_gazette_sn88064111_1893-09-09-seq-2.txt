Air'M REASONv W Yf
Our excellent contemporary, the
Valley of the Teche, takes issue
with as because of an article which
.appeared in The Gazette wherein
we gave it as our adis'iddal opinion
that the contemplated railroad be
tween this place and Breaux Bridge,
as well as the one between the latter
place and New Iberia, owing to cer
tain information that had reached
us, added to our own deductions
drawn from existing conditions,
would fail to materialize, and our
idea was and is, that it would be
best to concentalte our united ef
forts on a refinery, because a refin
ery could be secured in a few
months.
The Gazette is strongly impressed
'with the plea advanced by its es
teemed contemporary, and gives us
the opportunity to reiterate an often
expressed wish that no one can have
a stronger desire to see railroad con
nection between the two towns than
The Gazette, and it would hail with
pleasure the intimation that the rail
road officials had fully determined
to build this tap.
We took the view that for the im
mediate advancement of the real ma
tlrial interests of the town, it would
be advantageous to let go the rail
road scheme and devote our best
energies to the refinery. The refin
ery first, because it will enhance the
prosperity of the people to such a
degree that they will be better
equipped to grapple with the rail
road problem: The operating of a
refinery would at once place some
$s6o,ooo to $200oo,ooo a year in cir
calation, and besides it would tend
to revive the drooping confidence
of our farmers, caused by the small
returns which their staple crop, cot
ton, brings them. This waning
confidence must be revived. How
best to do so? We contend by the
building of a central refinery.
Confidence in the ultimate reali
zation of an object, and confidence
in the immediate certainty of an ab
solutely needed enterprise, are two
things, and The Gazette has as
sumed that the active support of the
latter will be most advantageous to
the people of the town, and this can
be done without dropping the form
er altogether. I'e believe results z
will be achieved all the sooner by
acting upon the lesson conveyed by
the father, whose son being unable
to break, together, the bundle of
sticks, was shown how easily it
could be done by breaking one at a t
time.
T7f. COMI0NG CROP.
There is a larger acreage in cane
in the Parish of Lafayette to-day
than has ever been cultivated be
fore. The planters have realized
that while cotton will always com
mand a market, the price is far e
from bringing the remunerative
returns for the same labor expended
that cane will, and, in consequence,
are turning their attention to the
latter crop.
Cane will yield from r5 to 35
tons to the acre in this parish, and
the price to-day is $4.25 a ton. It
is easy to see the profits that can be
made. Any good worker can raise
so acres of cane, and the other
crops of feed and vegetables he
needs, many, in other parts, have n
done even better. The crop is laid a
by in June, so his crop is made be-.'
fore the hot weather comes on.
Stop Talking Panic.
The country has been pretty s
nearly talked to death during the
past three or four months.
Somebody suddenly observed
that gold was going .off to Europe.
It had been doing this for three
years, but nobody noticed it until
the drain began to tell on the Gov
ernment's gold reserve. Then
somebody spoke of it with an omi
~ats shake of the head, and imme
diatel)r went up a great hue and cry
about the danger just ahead. The b
people were scared out of their wits.
They began to take their money out
h ks and hide it away some
Sbanks had to suspend.
.an to skimp and scrape
and deny themselves the
indulgences of life, and
found trade dull and I
to pay their bills.
conld be obtained we
"opor with a death c
Sof being sent about its -
Piaying debts. Bankt
loaded up their Vaults with reserves
of 3o, 4p, 3' or 6 per cent., :and
SreAssedjto cash their deposltors'
checks Qr loan a dmne on the best
of security. We becaml a nation
of nervous wrecks as to money mat
teg,--a nation of crazy fools, some
ad body has put it-and each" went
- about yelling ",Panic!" at the top
of his voice to alarm his neighbors
all the more.
It is surely about time to stop
tC such nonsense. Here is an official
e statement that there is in the posses
:h sion of the people of the country,
in outside of the Treasury, over sixty
n million dollars more than on August
M z, and nearly seventy millions more
e. than they had a year ago, when they
rr felt pretty flush. And yet this crazy
r- scare, induced by talk and kept alive
by senseless gabble, has so effec
ts tually banished it from its proper
s, place in business Tat the whole
ir country has been running on one
Âºe wheel for a month or more.
The way to restore confidence is
1- to restore confidence, and the best
w plan is the old Jerusalem style of
each man looking out for that part
of the wall over against his own
* door. Pay your bills. Use your
s money as you . would ordinarily.
n Pnt your cash in the banks. Don't
e talk panic, or act panic, and in a
- little while there will be no panic.-?

I- Outlook Encouraging.
d The announcement that all the
banks in Memphis had been notified
by their New York connections that
they were prepared to ship all the
money necessary to move the cot- i
d ton crop caused comparatively little =
comment in the trade in this city.
Vice President Anderson Gratz,
t of the American Manufacturing t
- Company, which supplies a large
e portion of the bagging used for cot
s ton in this country, in discussing 1
r the outlook said: "In the Memphis
section they have just begun to =
move the cotton. In the South
t Georgia and Texas sections they
began to move the product two
weeks ago. I think the financial '
1 stringency has been felt less in the
South than anywhere else. We v
e have every confidence in our cus- c
I tomers and are taking their notes r
- freely. The cotton growers are well f
off at this time because when they c
began to harvest the 1892-93 crop F
they could not get credit, and.con- t
sequently could not sell out in ad- 1
vance. Now they own their cotton
outright and there is a good market c
for it. The outlook in the South is t
very encouraging and money is now
comparatively eIsy."
lMarry in Haste.
SI"Marry in haste and repent at leisure,"
is a familiar proverb in all languages. Sage,
poet and humorist have all had their fling
at matrimony.

Ends Well."

marriage: r

Before he takes a wife, a
In fact, I see no earthly cause e
