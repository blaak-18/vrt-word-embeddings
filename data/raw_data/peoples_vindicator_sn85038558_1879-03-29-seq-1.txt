LIVER PILLS
FOR THE CURE OF
Eepatitis, or Liver Complaint.
DYSPIPSIA AND SICK HKADACHR.
Symptoms of a Diseased Liver.
[)AIN in the right side, under the A
l edge of the ribs, increases on pres
sure; sometimes the pain is in the left 1
side; the patient is rarely able to lie J
on the left side; sometimes the pain
is felt under the shoulder blade, and
it frequently extends to the top of the
shoulder, and is sometimes mistaken
for rheumatism in the arm. The stom
ach is affected with loss of appetite
and sickness; the bowels in general
are costive, sometimes alternative with
lax; the head is troubled with pain,
accompanied with a dull, heavy sen
sation in the back part. There is gen
erally a considerable loss of memory,
accompanied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done. A slight,
dry cough is sometimes an attendant. t
The patient complains of weariness
and debility; he is easily startled, his
feet are cold or burning, and he coin
plains of a prickly sensation of the t
skin; his spirits are low; and although i
he is satisfied that exercise would be I
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely i
summon up fortitude enough to try it. I
In fact, he distrusts every remedy. I,
Several of the above symptoms attend s
the disease, but cases have occurred ;
where few of them existed, yet exam- I
ination of the body, after death, has i
shown the LIVER to have been exten- I
sively deranged. I
d
AGUE AND FEVER. I
DR. C. MCLANE'S LIVER PILLS, IN 1
CASES OF AGUE AND FEVER, when U
taken with Quinine, are productive of
the most happy results. No better
cathartic can be used, preparatory to,
or after taking Quinine. We would C
advise all who are afflicted with this t'
disease to give them a FAIR TRIAL.
For all bilious derangements, and II
as a simple purgative, they are un- p
equaled. Ip

note the following accident to Mr. a
Wells and request our confrere of the a
&ntisel to extend to him our sym- a
pathlies:
On Sunday morning last at about ii
10 o'clock, the steamer Bart Able 8
passed Bayou Sara on her upward trip d
freighted withl the Natchiteches pria- h
oners and many ,of their friends who S
were with them in New Orleans dur-.
ing their persecution. The patriotic d
citizens of our sister village gave full d
evidene, of their rejoicing ever the k
release of these brave men, by the 0
frequent discharge of anvils and the b
discourse of sweet music by the Bayou a
Sara Brass Band. One very unfor- 1
tunate accident, however, ocensared t
which cast a damper upon the bight- d
ened spirits of the assembly. Mr. tl
Lawrence Wells, one of the most en. b
thusiastic of the gunners, while stoop- v
log to poor a charge of. powder in a
the touch hole, spilt some of the o Im
boatible composition on a live coal of te
fire on time ground, which immediate. a
ly ignited, and communicating with to
a paper bag partly filled with u
powder in the hands of our young a
friend, bleu it up, seriously, but we a
hope, not dangerously ounding bhit. d
Dqring the entire week his friends Il
have attended him both night anod I
day, and but for the most iron nerve b
he possesses, he weaould no doubt now 5y
be numbered among the missing. It fa
is our sincere 1ish, as well as that of I
his many friends that in a few days t1
be will again be on our streets. 8

This week we are informed of a
fiendish outrage perpetrated .upon a
I boy on Bayou du Large, on Thors
day evening, Feb. 28th. The scene
is at the house of a small farmer, Mr. ,
Phillip Lmnny, residing on the low
er line of Bayou du Large. Mr. Lan
maoy is away from home, sad his wife
and children left alone. It is dark
about seven o'clock, and 'the moeaer B
and her frolicksoone children are seat
ed around a cosy hearth, little dream
t ing of the dark cload above them.
Suddenly a kneok is heard at the
door. The unsuspecting mother sends
her oldest child-a son of about 12
years-"to open the door and see T
who is there." The boy opens the A
door, and, seel no one, goes out to H
I discover the mysterious cause or that A
knock. Bie makes but a few steps w
outside when he is suddenly seised e,
by a negro, black as the ace of spades ,
and carried into the adjoining field. m
The brute wares the scared boy not og
to utter a single cry under penalty of ,
death. The boy remains silent. In A
the meantime the mother not seeing di
her son return, calls him--but Ino
vain. The poor woman becomes
Iafrijited and a erle loudly for help. G,
Her neighbors are aroud and comne t
to the rescue; the premises are G
searched ; the boy is called, but all of
to no purpose. The neighbora give A,
up the search, and the po afflicted Ili
mother is i- despair, when in fa ,t
wail-a piteous cry, is heard from tie h,
, distant field. The peopip hasten to
thie spot, the. boy is foud-found li
I r ut n what condition. He body has w
b, een savagely mutilated and his C,
eouthful face almost difigemed, bet no
fortunately the numerous wopids G,
have mot proved fatal. What lead to M
this brutal ae, we cannot say. The ae
fiend has not been esptured and Lever -
will, in all probability.. Al

There are epidemics in matrimony, ar

It is said of Alston that he had
had many previous similar dilecul
ties in his life, and that he had a pre
sentiment that lie was to die sudden.

fact, his fadmr history includes a
bloody vendelts. His uncle, Angus
tun Alston, fought a duel in Florida
with rifles mnany years ago, and was
killed by his advqrsary, a nearsiight.
ed man, named Reed. His father
Willis Alston, met this man Reed in
the streets of Columbus, Ga., aubse
quently, and killed him. Reed's
brother now took up the quarrel, and ,
meeting Willis Alston in Texas, one
day, shot and killed hir."

to run you during the year. Youo
accounts are due the Ist of Novem
ber each year. You can't bold the
cotton. You are forced to take what.
ever price you are offered. You are
mistaken when you say it is your
cotton, for It never did belong to you.
Your creditors say what the product
of your labor is worth and you are
Iound by their dictations. And
your labor during the year was be 1
towed on the cnlture of this cottob,
neglecting to grow corn, wheat and
other grains that will make you in- I
dependent. The farmer will never
be prosperous and thrifty until he
ean make his produce yield him
above its productive coat. Thirbhe
can never do until he can have coo- I
trol of that produce and sell it when
his Judgment dictates. You see from I
th statistics your labor produces
more raw material then over. It
seems nature and your own exertions
have been more energetice then usual.
There is no want of effort In either.
But, alas! the stark, horrid ghastly
pltare of want is stilt overshadow- I
ing you. Nature and your own effort
have sueeeded and there is an error
and a grievous mistake somewhere.
Whenever there is an abandant yield
and still shere is want in the couneatry
it is evident there is a radical wrong.
That error is you. It eomes from

but we ean this: You go to your a
plow-tocks, azehelves, omes, sn
gletrees and many other thins that I
economy soggests yon should make

aneestors did male at home. You J
me told that these thingp an now be

you pan have them made and on n- Ip
per and talk is dues seem so. Butnt
dethobnry and practeie will not hold
out. Yoeesan show conclusively by
figure that is s cheaper to reis all
eotton and bay your core. Try it one
year and your igulres have deelived
you. You are extravagant is not as.
tang the fersilsing elements on your I
own land. From this you get our1
Idea of your extravagance.
Again, yoa plant too mush cotton
and too little eorm and other grain.
You would have realised as much
maney for your cotton erop this year
if yeou had raised only half the
amiount. If the labor then of rasis
mg. this serplas of eotton had
