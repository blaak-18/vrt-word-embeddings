N. O. Bulletin, eint.
" This Republican sheets of the Nortl~
accepting the mendacious reports of
their Southern coajutors, have pre.
sistentlyiisrepre seuted. every;,effori
made ly the white, people of the
South to secure an honest erection
and admfointration, And In iao one
particular have they labored-, more
streunously than they hlave to create
a" falal inpression concerning the
'object;'bf tlie "White Leauge," Ig
'nodrathe fect that' acouatnr leafgue
on the.part of the blacks has existed
ever since the year 8(idi .
A brief history of the origin of the
Black League in the State of Mis
sissippi may contribute, in some miens
ure, to correct the opinions formed in
consequence of these false statements.
Soon. after the close rV the war the
ounth was flooded with a clasp nf ad
vdnturers who diiscovered, in tihl ig
irg!ance and superstition of the negro,
a sure means of elevating and en
riching themselves. They began by
alarming their dupes pith reports
that the white men intend to de rive
them of their recently.acquired lib
erties; that they were resolvqd to
grant thenm no privileges under the
law, and that all their efforts were
being directed to the end of reduieing
them again to slavery; Under the
specious pretext of providing a main.
tenance for widows, orphans au4 sn
perannuated negroes, they orgasized
societies which were given the ifame
of "Union. Brotherhoods." Small
sums of money were exacted from
each member, ostensibly for the pur
pose of providing a benevolent fad,
bit, inreality, to further the ends of
their carpetrbag leaders,
These brotherhoods were soon
transfi~med into secret organizations,
anid assumid the name of "Black
LeMgue.'.. Imposing upon the efedu.
lityandesuperstition of the negooes,
they, ound them by the most terible
oathp tosecrecy; and instructe ithem
in digns, passe-words, and all' the other
forms of secret orders. So thd6eagh J
ly under the control of these leagunes
were the members, and even ;thone
who were not members, that they
dare not take the responsibility of
acting independently of their instruec
tions. When the constitution of 18%6
was defeated, by a majority of 7000,
in Mississippi, numbers of negroes
were prevailed upon, and assurances
of protection against outrage from
their fellow-negroes, to vote against
it. They trembled te they polled
their vote, and invariably exclaimed
that they looked'for protection to the
white people. In many instances
they were really attacked, and their
lives threatened, while, at the same
time, they were upbraided with hav
ing violated their oaths. In all sub
sequant elections not one of them
has dared to vote . otrary .to the
diretijon of hip league., ,Just lefore
eletiop a courier passes from planta
tied to' plantation, and reads an edict,
puripfdtng to be an' addreds from the
Cnttal -.Hepubliean Committee, butl
what in,realty is a secret orderfroa

The Blacki League of Mississippi
has long been, in efftrect, a military or

The Color Line.
We see that mnly of our cotempo.
raries are begiuning to advocate a
white man', party, a party based on
color, which shill include all the
whites if the Stal regardless of old
party ties, name of fflliation. This
is an issue that the conservative- or
Democratic press' and people have
tried earnestly to tave off, and have
used every mInean epnsisteut with lion.
or to avoid, and have approached
even to the verge eo'timidity in their
desire to prevent patty lines from be
ing based upon races This line was
early establihsed by the Radical and
they have been as e ldulous in keep
ing up and strengthning this it as we
have been in trying to break it down,
in our siqeere belief that it could
only be productive of mischief, and
probably Iii the end beget an animo
sity that wotfld prove destructive of
the best interests of our cotntry.
But the issue is upon us and we can
not longer avoid it if we would. We
have tried: onciliation, We have nused
reason, argument, persuasion, all in
vain. Conciliationl and copromise
has met with coldness and distrust,
reason and argument with sneers.
The negro is thoroughly inqculate4
with the idea that the White Muan'
interest is necessarily antagonistic to
his own, and lsa been firmly impres
ed by his scalawag and carpet.bag
leaders anll instructors, that what
ever ii to the' white man's interest, is
beyond all question to his disadvan
tage. They have been taught to re
gard with suspicion any and every
thing that came from the white man,
and well have they learned thelesson,
He will believe'teadily, whatever any
straggling adventurer, claiming to be
long to the loyal al.leagu, may choose
to tellohim, if it be but something
against or detrimentaltto the interest
or honor of the Southern white manr.
To convince the colored man that
we were not opposed to Northern man
and a Radtcal, for the Gubernatorial
Chair, believing him a good man, who
would do justice to both sides, aid
again, giving away to his prejudice,
because, he was a brother-in-law of
that Mahonmet of this worship, Gen.
Grant. What was the renst of this
concession! The negro voted dead
against him, because, the white man
souported him. ,.,
Hdw  uchk longes must it take ti
whilte peolet to unde'statid that tfis
Color Line is already established, and'
drawn in, the deepest and darkest hues.
We may. hut our eyes, and atteonpt
to ignore it, but it will not alter the
fact that it is so. The Radicals have
drawn thetine linid arrayed the ne-1
groes in solid ranks, with a strict cen
sorship to prevent " their, straying.
Their Leagues are strictly organized,
and bind theim'b tie strongest oaths
that they kdow rhow to administer.
Every negroio. Siaor against the
white man.., Tooe is only one thing
left for us, and that is to meet the s.
sue manfally. ' liere is no .dodging

SENAtOR MORTOx AND LOUISIANA.-..
In an article criticizing the recent
Speech of Senator Morton at Terre
Haute, the St. Louis Republican re
marks:
In vain.does Senator Morton with
carefully judggled phrase invoke new
politic life for himself and new pros.
pect for his fortunes from the trans.
portation question. The memory of
Louisiana whom he struck down in
his pride and power, haunts him.
Even while he prates of the "wrong
of the farmer," the pitifnll face of the
stricken Commonwealth is upturned
to him in, her agony, and upon it is
written the story of wrongs of the
farmer are almost trivial.
No mabI may escape aXemesis, and
such is, Louisiana to Morton. The
memory of her woe is branded upon
the muids of men as with a searing
Iron, and with the smarting brand his
atd 'in Ineffaceably coupled. We
ase not ofithesewho ceaselessly yearn
for lyeange. , There are Wted who
ha-stlpned in the way of oppressing
Secnquered people, who can be and
ate freely forgiven for the sake of
their reletance, told in good works
even at the eleventh hour. But Mor
ton is not one of those men. The
ti& turned, the eleventh hour passed
and still' fdnd the maths of hias n
gem fresh upon the throat of Louis
iana, so that for him it is too late to
repent.
