The absorbing opic seems to be
the ammo, undr whbich the whate peo
ple of this State. 'iBall do battle for
their constitutigeql righlts, for their
liberties as freemie; In the great 'vic
tory to be won in November next.
For ourselves we are not choice, and
are willing: perfictly, to take any ti
tie that will bear with it any certain
ty of success, although we fail to see
what good use there id iu party ap
pellations, unless a fixed andi broad
set of principles be enunciated which
will command the respect, attention
and support of the white citizens of
Louisiana.
In the issue now before as we have
butone object in view, as have all men,
no matter what particular preferences
they may have for this political or
ganization or that, who are seriously
interested and really in earnest, and
are actuated by that one patriotic
motive; and that Is the redemption of
our fair Stats frojm the misrule of the
Radieal and Negro party, who feast
among the ruins of our once proud
prosperity.' This great problem con
tains not one. spgle question f. the
success of. any great Nationalt , ,
and is in fact utterly foreign to them,
as parties. What ire desire is, that
we should not be misunderstood in
this canvass as advocating ' Demo
cratic or Republican principles, and
therefore we'ap people consider the
Democratic party as a party, as a
National organization; have no more
right to demand our support pr die
tate'; line of polie .to us than the
Repubicean party,~a a party have.
We are tryinag to redeem Louisiana,
and in so doing, ask the formation
of a 8tate organization having a plat
form broad enough l prineiple to
admit of. ,bom for all classat and
shades of politiil 'opinioa; of aien
who Id ld estly iqseers I their 'de,
sire and d64tailamtion to rid the
Stateda badgovoernment. a ..

Ignorant or Criminal.
The New Orleans I.7plics takes
a very stinPglarow ol the action od
our people, in renovimg certain
ish offlers; and in i:article inwto1
ia of altk inst., It trays a willfal
criminality or a wanton ignorance of
the whole matter. Its idul of the 1
"basis principle of Republiman gov
einient" is well worthy the consid
eration of some despot, for, the con
ception of Democracy theraeaaneia
ted, could be imitatld 'with good ef
fect by the Khan of Tartery. This I.
the first time we hboar that, law is
the "basis principle" of Republies,
and still notwithstand so good an an
thority as the New Orleans Republi
can, being the olcislamoutlh-piece of
thbee whom, either self constituted or ,
not, have the bsnor of expounding4
the Constitution, we beg leave in our
humble ignorance to differ... It has
the candor to admit that 'ire have
among as, however, a doctrine that
whenever a ,law of taation 'repre
sstation," mark, well, "ftaxstio or
reprmestation," is opprelres upon
those trio disapprioe "of it, thelps a
reserved ad irnalienable i gbt to
evade or resist such law." The above
clause we think seotains all'ie "ba
eis of Republics, and certabily that
of the United States, for it was i on
that principle and in direct ltieo
of the ,laws of England,. that the
Colopist's,revolted against, not only
the wll of the mass of the English
people, kat against the wishbe of the
mass of the (kmbist's tA seduew; for
we are well' aware that datiog the
dark and trylpg days of the Revola.
tion, the patriot Colonist's were af
flicted with just such trimmersas the
Republica., and jast ph . inebnsist
ant reasoners existed.'
It was upon this doctrine which is
garbled in its meaning as expressed
In the Repaubliea, but' whid, a peo*
pli determined; to be free perfectly

parish ",praded and resieted' the law

whom as a majority we murstelbmit;

been by reason of foisting into ppwer
such characters as are represented by
the Repablica, who after collecting
an enormous amount of money for
these very Canals and Levees and
misapprppriating it, have the audaci

robbed and ruined people, a lecture r
upon the duty of citises and an gov

slap as in the face with being fed
with "Federal rations, and receivrng
Federal benefits without seruple and
without thanks." We suppose this

- The vietory of Pindabsck, the ad
voae of his race eptd d.he Africni
aten of oar State+, 4fraello and
Pdikard, the whinldg fallowers and
the white-livered fhinkies, who are
willing, and do sarifice their honor
and the respectability of their race
for gaie, is, we think, enough to sat
isfy those who would longer wish to
deal in 'this wishey-washey never-to
sdcdoed policy of open affiliation.
Here is the question brought home
and we cannot iee for the life of ui,
how" the honorable white man can
possibly shirk the lesse. Pinchbeck
declares the colored man in the ma
jority, and for that reason and that
reason alone, he should assert his
right to control the, State. For turn
sad twist, dodge It as you may, there
it stands staring you in the face.

We were stunned, utterly astonish
ed, 4bat some leading men in our
parish were advpcating the same old
want-of-candor policy, that has mark
ed our "course in our political can
vas for the past, six years. T'hat we
find among as men, who have been
tried in a thousand ways and found
puare, who would desire that this
"cup might pass from their lips," is
not at all singular. No man who
has the best interests of his country
at heart, would wish to array one
race against the' other, but ft hi beet
done without our consest and we must
meet the issue, or no more boast of
our superiority. The question of the
white man's party hue been ably ar
gued, and In all it lights and bear.
ligs we have been unable to see any
semblance of ostracism, prsoriiption
or disfranehisement, as some have
discovered.'
We do not object to the negro ea
joying amy right, any privilege, that
we enjoy, if he can attain that right or
prievi through is.mw superior edu
eatioa and d*arekr, but we distinct
ly declarethat he is not fitted to en
joy ofeial poeiiam now, from the
fact that his mental ealiber-that his
property identification is not at all
suffiient to entitle him to such mark
ed eooaideration of being constituted

will be required to have, if we wirold
succeed in this contest-boldnass and

•J. We declare that we do not in.
lead to deprive the colored citizen of
any right which is guaranteed to him
by the Constitution and laws of this
State or of the United States-on ti
a~itrary, we firmly declare it to be
our fixed purpose to foster and pro.
tect him in all vested rights, to edu.
cate him and his children, are willing
to be taxed for that purpose, aso tl
they may become fit to take part i
the management of affairs of goverl,

industry, and by a system of wio
legislation, add to his mental, moral
and material progression.
4th. To do this we insist that tin
white race alone is' capable of bring.
log about reform in our affairs, t
by reason of their saperior intelli.
gence they are alone fitted to govern,
and that all offiees of honor, pnrt
and trust, shall be Ailed by hoaet ano

5th. We call upon all men with.
oat regard to past political diferen.
eos, without regard to race color at
previous condition, who are honest
and sincere in their protestations for
good And honest government, to unite
with us ii: the election and qualifica
tion of white men, fully competent to
.11 positions and of known and tried
virtue, who represent the material
intrest of our tax-payers and good
citizens, and we request and desire
the co-operation and support of the
colored men of this Parish and State,
who are rea1 desirous for a return
to an eonolesical conduct of govern
meat.
6th. We state that the People's, the

redemption of our Parish and State
from the rule of incompetent and cor

Warra BMEN, the manaagement of our
local and State pairs. That the

unite their efforts with the good peo
