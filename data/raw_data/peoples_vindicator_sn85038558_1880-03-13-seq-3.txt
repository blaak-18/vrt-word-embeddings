We have nosympathy for that class
of young men who sneer at the la
borer as he tolls from day today;
who have a horror of a horny hand;
whose dellcate feelings are hurt by the
grlme and dust and soot which stain
the mechanic's honest palms. Yet
bow many are there of just suob
obharacter, in every hamlet, town vil
Iase, and city in the land ! They are
the drones in the great hive of buma
ulty, who toll not, neither do they
spln, but are content to live off the
labor and sweat of their fellow men;
leading an aimless life, and never
leaving a single impress on the sands
of time, to golude hereafter some for
lorn and shblpwreked brother. They
heed not the poet' refrain:
"Let as then be up and doing,
With a heart for every fate,
Still achieving, still puraling,
Learn to labor, and to wait."
Will some one rite and eaplain
why it Is that no enterpris, no mat

with success or attain permamnaey,
in this ioty ? There are not wanting
men, both young and of maturer
years, men of intelligence, enterprise
and energy, to inaugurate projeots
for the mental, moral and physiaol
culture of themselves and their fel
low citiseans. Bu these efforts seem
to be'merely sporadlc, and after a
brief strut upon the stage of life

The number for April is one of un
usual attractiveness; its pages are
brilliant with literary and artistic
gems. Among the most notable ar
ticles are a charming German alle
gory, "The Maiden of the Winged
Wheel"; a comprehensive article on
the Mormons, by the Rev. W. Fiem
ing IStevenson, entitled "A City of
Saints." It is profusely illustrated,
as Is likewise "Martib Luther," a
blograpical study, by A. H. Guern
sey. There is a timely and appro
priate article by M. E. W. B., en.
titled "Fashion and Faith." The
subject of No. III. of "The Children
of the Bible," is "Joseph the Dream
er." The department of fiction con
tains, besides, the continuation of
the popular serials "Be-Be, the
Nailmaker's Daughter" and "Little
Hinges," some exceedingly interest.
iog stories by celebrated writers.
There are poems of unusual merit;
one by J. D. Burns entitled "Baal.
bek," with two views of the anieent
city; "April," by the late Frances
Ridley Havergal (finely illustrated),
and the "Magnificat," a poem of the
New Testament, by the Bishop of
Derby, are admirable. "Beligious
Notes and News, at Home and
Abroad," is a new and interesting
feature. There are numerous illus
trations and descriptions of ecoles
stical architecture, scenery natoral
history, adventure, etc. Also many
articles illustrative of religious hab.
Its and customs, with Sritptural in.
terpretations. In faot, the 128 quar
to pages teem with most delightful
and edifying matter. The illustra
tions number about 100. A single
number is only 5 aents, and the
annual subscription $3, postpaid.
