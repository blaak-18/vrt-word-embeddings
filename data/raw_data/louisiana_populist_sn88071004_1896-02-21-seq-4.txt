Nervous
People wonder why their nerves are so weak;
why they get tired so easily; why they do not
sleep naturally; why they have frequent head
aches, Indigestion and
Nervous Dyspepsla. The explanation is
simple. It is found in that impure blood feed
ing the nerves on refuse instead of the ele
ments of strength and vigor. Opiate and nerve
compounds simply deaden and do not cure.
Ilood's Sarsaparilla feeds the nerves pure,
reh blood ; gives natural sleep. perfect diges
tion, i the true remedy for all nervous troubles.

The Parisian wits are reviving an
old story about the wonderful cure
from deafness of a patient who was
a recommended to go to hear "Lohen
grin," and to sit near the orchestra,
by the trombones. The doctor ac
comhanied his patient and sat beside
him. All of a sudden, while the noise
of the instruments was at the loudest.
the deaf man found he could hear."
*'Doctor," he almost shrieked, "I can
hear." The doctor took no notice.
"I tell you, doctor," repeated the man,
in ecstacy, "you have saved me. I
have recovered my hearing." Still
the doctor was silent. He had be
come deaf himself.

's WILLIAM WALDORF ASTOR FOR
SAKES HIS COUNTRY.
SDeclares from Ills Home In England
e that lie Will Never Return to Amer
I'a to LAve-To Marry an Ex-.meri
:an uirl, L~idy Churchial:.
T IS asserted by
Sforeign gossips that
shortly after the
prescribed term of
mourning William
Waldorf Astor will
marry Lady Ran
dolph Churchill.
Mrs. Astor, former
ly Miss Paul, of
Philadelphia, died
Dec. 22, 1S91. Lord
Randolph Churchill's death occurred
early last year. William Waldorf As
tor is the first one of his family who
ventured outside the beaten paths of
commerce and society. lie read law,
entered politics and wrote books, and,
a few years ago went over to England
and devoted part of his ancestral mil
lions to printing periodicals and a
newspaper, with the double view of
cultivating and enlightening the Brit
ish mind. He had acquired a taste for
life abroad in a residence of three years
as United States minister to Italy in
Arthur's term. Mr. Astor at first rent-,

ed Lansdowne House as a residence,
paying $25,000 annually. He then!
bought a London residence and subse
quently purchased Cliveden, an estate
on the Thames, from the Duke of West- 1
minster. Here it was that Mrs. Astor I
died. Shortly after her death her hus
band discontinued the printing of the
Pall Mall Budget, an illustrated week
ly belonging to him. He assigned the
somewhat strange reason for permit
ting the periodical to die that his wife
had taken an active personal interest
in the journal, and he sought to honor
her memory by stopping the publica
tion. Enterprising Englishmen are
now issuing a paper called the New
Budget, which in dress, style and scope
of subject is a reproduction of the As
tor weekly. Mr. Astor's income is rated
as high as $10,000,000 per year and his
r-operty is valued all the way up to
$150,000,000. He has three children,
Waldorf, a boy of 16; Pauline, 15 yers i
old, and the fourth, John Jacob, 9 years i
old. He recently said that he would I
never live in America again.

Orstetal to the Stowaway.
Stowaways usually receive scant
courtesy from the indignant omcers of
the ship. on which they steal passage,
and usually, too, scant ratlons and plen
ty of work, with a prospect of jail at
the end of the trip. A stowaway on
one of the Pacific steamers, however,
an a recent trip from Yokohama to Ta
coma, received not only the best of
tretmnent, but a substantial present of
money when he left the ship. The yes
sel eneanoutered a heavy storm on the
voyage, sad the stewaway, who was
weralng about the deck, distingdaished
himself by great bravery at one of the
mut perilous moments during the gale.
The oelcers made up a purse of 2O for
him to help him on his eourney after
her left the ship.

the knowledge that so many forms of
sickness are not due to anyv actual dis
ease, but simply to a con-tipated condi
tion of the system, which the pleasant
family laxative, \rupof Figs. prompt
ly removes. Thatl is why it is the only
remedy with millions of families, and is
everywhere esteemed so hig~hly by all
who value good health. Its beneficial
effects are due to the fact, that it is the
one remedy which promotes intcrnal
cleanliness, without debilitating the
organs on which it acts. Itis therefore
all important, in order to get its bene
ficial effects, to nit, when you pur
chase, that you have the genuine article.
