The Burning Question.
During the iext campaign the
people of the United States will be
called upon to answer the most se
rious question they have ever had
to tace. The question is: are the
peoplle capable of self government ?
It will not come in the form of any
issue that has been presented here
totore but on the question of wheth
er the government shall control
finance, or finance control the gov
ernment. There will be other mui!
iflying questions arise and the dan
ger to the people lies in their be
ing liable to permit minor ques
tions to over-shadow the greater.
The one great question of money
must be settled in the next cam
paign if it is ever settled peacably.
The people must lay aside their
differences on other great questions
and array themselves on the side
of free and unlimited coinage of
silver and government issue of
money, without the intervention of
banks. When this question is set
tied to the satisfaction of the peo
ple and the safety of the country
then other issues will arise and
other divisions would not injure
the cause of the people. If the
people who favor government con
trol of the finance suaffer them.
selves to be divided into hostile
armies to destroy each other, it
will show their inability to look af
ter their own welfare, and there is
no doubt that every possible nieth
od will be used to divide and con
quer the forces of liberty. No one
who uuderstauds the situation can
doubt the importance of unlimited
coinage of silver and the issuance
of all money by the government.
Will the friends ofreform in faunce
permit themselves to be drawn
away from the main issue by some
other question that can be as safe
ly solved in 1900, as it can now
There is a class of men who hang
on like grim death to all their de
mands and say they will die light
ing before they give up one of them.
Their nerve is to be admired, but
how about their judgment?
These claim they are reformers
on the line. "Land, finance and
transportation." What would you
think of a general who had three
divisions of a county to detend
from an invading foe who would
not concentrate his forces against
the ememy when he saw a chance
for a decisive battle, but would
have his strength scattered all
over the three divisions of his ter
ritpry. The strength of the ene
mims et popular liberty Is now con
stratord on the attempt to take
the control of the finances away <
from the people and into their own
hands. There never has been as:
great eneroahments on the rights
of the people-as represented by 4
the ooestttution and goverment-.
as have been made in the last fear
years. The money power has al I

platform may have no plank de

to destroy the money p6wer is for
all its opponents to get into one
party organized for that purpose.'
Then when this is accomplished
what is to hinder the friends of
government ownership of all natu
ral monopolies from getting togeth
er and making a clean fight on that
question and then the satme with
land monopoly. Of course we
know that there is a class of dema
gogues who will profess to be so
patriotic as to fight to the death
for the whole plattorm, but we do
not think that class of men is com
petent to lead any body to victory,
but always todeath. Weno donbt
risk getting the antagonism of this
class in taking the stand we do,
but we do it honestly and for what
we believe to be the good of the
whole people. Destroy the power
of the gold gamblers and banking
monopoly and it will be easy to ac

our friends who may not agree with
us on all, but weakens usaud gives
the enemy greater strength. The
threatened revolt of the extreme
socialists will not weaken us, but
bring us greater force from the
conservative element. Let us win
the silver fight at all hazards first.
Then on to victory along other
lines.-Battle Flag.

Under this caption the New
York Sun (evening edition) of Jan
unary 1st sounds the bugle call of
plutocracy which summons their
merciless minions to another on
slaught upon helpless American
wealth producers. In prophetic
spirit, the inspired high priest of
the modern Moloch says:
"The year does not promise any
thing of momentous interest es
pecial to the United States. The
industrial processes that are im
piled by 5 cent cotton and 50 cent
wheat are of a tedious character."
Take that ye mortgage ridden
farmers and realize what the keen
est mind in the service of plutoc
racy accepts as the standard upon
which business of this favored
country must hereafter rest.
There is no hope or expectation
of raising this standard above that
fixed by the "Sun" so long as pro
ducts are raised "for sale."
There is henceforth no hope for
the American farmer except the
co-operative commonwealth where
in the labor represented in a bush
el of wheat or a pound of cotton
shall exchange in any part of our
common country for a like amount
of labor represented in any line of
merchandise. No deductions for
rent, interest, pro~t or taxation,
every function of production, trans
portatadh sad distribution being
performed at cost, sa the postal
service is nowperformed, by train
ed and e~eist publio oioers. Of

The sting of this editorial, like
other venomous stings, is at the
tail, where proof is given of the
identity of interest etweeoon the
producer of 5 cent cotton, 50 cent
wheat and the railroad boys. It
says:
"Such, then, are some of the
features of the year 1895 that come
home to men's pockets and bosoms.
Each purveys seine food for
thought and seems to impose a pru
dence that need not he anxiety.
One fact, clear as the sun at noon,
is that American transportation
has to cut its expenditures. A
smart share of this cut must per
force fall upon the pay rolls."
Ye railroad men who believe that
the railroads will hesitate before
inviting another great strike take
those inspired writings as your
answer from a triumphant plutoc
racy. Dividends and interest must
be maintained until the people own
and operate the roads, and you are
doomed like blind Sampson to
grind corn for the Philistines until
you grasp the pillars of monopoly's
temple on election day and drag it
down. From the ruins of private
monopoly the people will build a
temple of universal prosperity in
scribed, collective ownership of all
the means of production and dis
tribution.
H. B. SALISBURY.
A Note Of Warning.
From the Watchman.
The more we consider the prop
osition of a single issue on financi
al reform the more necessary it
appears. Had we doubted it pre
viously, the action of the St. Lou
is conference would have confirm
ed us fully in the idea. For years
we have contended that the two
old parties were afraid to make a
fight squarely upon the financial
system of this country. We have
charged them in the press and up
on the stump with using the
"bloody shirt" and the tariff in
order to sidetrack the possibility
of such an issue. In making these
charges there is not the shad9w of
doubt that we were right. 'Now,
however, when we have dtiven
them from point to point, when
the stern logic of events has forced
them to acknowledge that the
question of finance is supreme and
that they are ready to meet it, we
find a few people in our ranks who,
through tactics similar to those of
the two old parties seek to avoid
the issue. Such action is repre
hensible, and we do not believe it
will be tolerated by the populist
party. We have demamled for
years a full and free discussion of
these iancial questions before the
people, in order that they might
vote iaitelligently upon this impor
tant subject, and now, when the
opportunity is at last secured,
some who claim to be oar own peo
ple smeking to sidetrack the con
test. This casno be done, and
thos who seek to bring about such
a resultwillfalnd themselves in a
hopeless mianority. The battte for
Iasnialrefrm is mow oe, and
noane, save the coward or the
traitor will refue to taike a part.

Once upon a time (that makes`
you think of childhood stories,
. doesn't l)-it matters not when and
it matters not where-a ship was
r wrecked off the coast of a fertile
island. The crew and paAsangers
were saved together with many
things from the ship's store. But
food and shelter must be produced
and many were put to .farming by
_ inclination or generar desire: Dog
wood being plenty, plow-beams
were made of it. As the popula
tion increased and more farmers
used plows, dog-wood gave out,
r farmers could not plow, food be
came scarce, and distress and anx
iety overspread the island. Some
dog-wood plow beams were held
by a sew who had not used them
much. At this serious crisis a
farmer wont to the community's
plow-maker, and asked to have a
t plow-beam made of oak, which
grew in abundance, but the plow
maker asked him if he ever heard
of a plow-beam made of oak.- He
must he crazy! The matter was
laid before the officers who owned
the few dog-wood plow-beams, and
they were astonished at the very
idea! The farmer was told to go
home as he had lost his reason.
But necessity being the mother of
invention, the farmer slept over
- the matter and presented himself
- before the plow maker next morn
ing, and told him he thought he'
could solve the problem. If he
would make him an oak plow-beam
and base it on the dog-wood beami
he thought it would work. This
was a new idea. It was lail be
fore the owners of the dog-wo3d
I beams, and they thought it would
work. So mechanics were set to
work making oak plow-beams, and
soon there were a thousand beams
based upon the dozen dog-wood
beams, on which the owners of the
dog-wood beams collected a royal
ty. It worked. In 20 years the
owners of the dog-wood beams'
owned all the island-land, cattle,
houses and all the oak beams too.
And wasn't it a pretty slick scheme :
Of colase, we wise Americans
laugh at such childish stories. We
don't do such foolish things, not
we. Onr gold basis money is not
of that nature-o, no! And the
band plays Annie Rooney while the
rich dance and the poor starve.
