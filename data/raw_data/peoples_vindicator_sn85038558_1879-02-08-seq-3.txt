The complaint this winter of dogs and
their depredations upon stock, particular
ly sheep, is. universal. Farmers in the
aeighborhood of this city have lost, In
the last month onm doegs, at least 300
head of grown sheep and near 1000 lambs
In value about 2,000. Are we to con.
tinue to rear sheep, or must we turn our
attention to dogs? That question now
agitates the public mind. In other
States It has long been settled that sheep
are of Imore proft sad beneft to farmers
than degs. Whether this can be brought
about in our state remains to be seen.
It Is at least worth a trial. Let us then
declare war on the dogs for a season, and
try and save our mutton ?

t Our Cou r ( ir ll Pia Is no lugeu r thoe
Snumbre appearance it possessed for
if eight years, or nearly. In those dreary
y days it was the resort of crowds of
- idle negroes and worthless white
g scamps. Courts were gala days for
is professional jurymen, and the gang
i. waxed fat on parish paper, while de
r cent people, who payed the piper,
r- groaned in anguish of spirit.
Our district judiciary has, since the
'retirement of Myers of notorious
fame, been purged of imbecility and
p corruption. Judge C. Chaplin brought
4 to the bench, in 1875, purity of char
acter and judicial learning; lie was
I. succeeded by Judge D. Pierson of
i equal characterand ability. Our par
Sish court lingered in the lap of igno
. ance until Judge J. M. B. Tucker
If was triumphantly elected by the
I white and colored democrats of the
n parish. This places our ermine on a
Is line, as to purity and capacity. May
e it so remain. Clerk Tunnard, elected
e upon the Republican ticket in 1876,
has made so far a most excellent of
e ficial. Hie has, from bench, bar and
+. lobby, met encomium and good will.
e Sheriff Deblieux and his chief deputy,
t Col. W. W. Breazeale, have re-enstat
a ed thIe sheriff's office to its old standard
and you enter now to find business
e men, intent on publie business. Mr.
Kearney, the Recorder, and every one
I knows George, is in clover, for he is
surrounded, in his public hour, by
gentlenmen who are fit associates. The
s old "gang" is gone and with them
Sgoes the hope their like may never
return to darken our peace and pros
perity. Sheriff Breazeale has changed
the diet of the prisoners in jail from
"neck and corn bread" to a diversi
fled bill of fare. Hie gives them vege
tables, such as beans, turnips and po
tatoes, with flour bread alternate days
a and good wholesome soup. This is
' as it shbould be. Prisoners are not
Sbruates and their health and misfor
tunes demand care and kindness.
On last Monday quite a crowd gather
f ed on Front street to witness a set-to
between a gentleman of tape and weights
and a well known knight of the last and
i hammer. Owing to the absence of the
I sporting frateroity pools were not open
ed. The side-walk was the place selected
for the battle ground. Gen. Benzine, who
is well known in this vicinity for his I
I true grip of love for the boys, was seleet- '
"ed as referee by the knight. Time was
eatled, and the valisat knight after the I
first round was sent into the getter in I
seven beautifol tableans with a pane- I
ranml ertain drawn over bhi left optic,
giving a beautiful picture of the eleet of a I
mud bath. This last roand ended the fan
for the boys, and the knight was seen 1
wending his way to his mansion, some i
thought to retire beneath the shades of a
leather beach, but not so; with the
thermometer up In the hundreds and a
hammaer within his reacb, how could be?
An idea struck him; being scarea ofpegs
he would bammer that clerk's kadwl

So far tihe supply of labor has been

SIn our opinion this removal of Ia

The dismal winter we have just
