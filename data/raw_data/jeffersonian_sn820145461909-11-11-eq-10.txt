Jeffersonian Club News
The outlook for the organization
of twenty-five clubs in Georgia with
in the next few weeks is very bright,
and by the first of the year it is
probable that we shall have a State
organization.
A Jeffersonian Club, with a mem
bership of 116, was formed at Bow
man, Ga., and Mr. J. J. Brown was
elected president.
Clubs at Thomson, Ashland, Litho
nia, Millen, and LaGrange, Ga., and
at Steprock, Ark., are reported to be
increasing their membership rapidly.
Ve would be glad to receive reports
from other club secretaries.
The Thomson Club appointed a
committee at their last meeting to
decide upon having a button for their
members. Suggestions from other
clubs will be welcomed. Address all
commcnications on this subject to the
Secretary, Jeffersonian Club No. 1,
Thomson, Ga.
Bowman, Ga., Oct. 17, 1909.
In response to a call of the people
of Goshen District, Elbert county,
Georgia, the following met and or
ganized a Jeffersonian Club, the pur
pose of such organization being to
discuss in a non-partisan and inde
pendent way such legislative matter
affects local matters, county,
State and nation, at all times adher
ing to the principles of government
as taught by Thomas Jefferson,
namely, the people rule, a govern
ment of the people, by the people
and for the people, and not a gov
ernment by and for the few:

The organization of Jeffersonian
Clubs is spreading very rapidly
throughout the State. At Bowman a
club was organized a week or two
ago with a membership of one hun
dred and seven.
This club is composed of repre
sentative citizens from every walk in
life. Not only is this movement
drawing recruits from the very best
citizenship, but from every political
party. If we properly understand
the object of these clubs they are in
tended to promote the principles of
government as taught by Jefferson.
It is strictly a non-partisan move
ment. They will not try to further
the interest of any one political par
ty, but will be independent. At the
same time they will meet at regular
periods for the purpose of discussing
questions of governmental econom
ics. They will demand from their
lawmakers, of whatever political
faith or creed laws for the benefit of
the greatest number, and will see to
it that only those who are thor
oughly in sympathy with the doc
trine of “Equal rights to all and spe
cial privileges to none’’ receive their
support. If this movement grows,
as it undoubtedly will, and they ad
here to their intention of independ
ent action in all matters political, it
will see the passing of party slavery
and party prejudice.
Our club is now one hundred and
twenty strong and we will double by
January first. —J. J. 8., in Royston
