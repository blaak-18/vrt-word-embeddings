S" must be driven
out," said the
general, low
lw * ering his field
glasses, and
turning a pair
of cold gray
.eyes upon a
staff officer
S who was stand
ing near.
"If we could get a battery into Clip- 1
per Gap," responded the officer ad
dressed, "the question might be set
1 tied, and at close range. The config
uration of the land and the bore of our
guns combine, it seems to me, to make
m any other solution impossible." 1
s "Clipper Gap!" echoed the general,
h rising visibly in his saddle, and then 4
° settling back with a sarcastic smile. t
S"Clipper Gap, did you say, colonel?
e White, you are talking at random. t
7 Surely your suggestion is not feasible.
You ought to know that a battery
a could not live to unlimber there, but
even if it got into action-why, good !
God, man, you must be dreaming."
Col. White looked hurt, and instead 4
of meeting the sharp glance of his
commander, he allowed his eyes to
wander down to the left, and in the
direction of an old plantation dwell
f ing, where a masked mortar battery (
had, an hour before, opened on the a
federal lines with terrible effect. t
P "I merely mentioned the matter,
general," replied the staff officer, after i
y a few moments of silence. "I shall be
r glad to execute any orders that you
may have in the consummation of a
r better plan."
"iBut, my good man," returned the 1
general, "a gunner could not live five I
minutes at the Gap. It would be down
right murder to order a battery in I
there. Col. White, would you lead a
battery into Clipper Gap?" t
"What a question," replied theother. C
1 "What a question for a soldier. To be
sure I would lead a battery into the P
Gap, or into hell for that matter-if
ordered to do so. By the way, gen
eral, this would be a great opportunity t
for your brave Capt. Langhorne."
Gen. Colby laughed heartily.
"Can't you forgive me, White, for
saying that Langhorne is the bravest
man in the Third corps? You grow
sarcastic every time you refer to the
conversation of last evening. Lang
horne is brave-brave as a lion. I
know him under fire. Southerner, is
he not? Col. Williams told me that he
had two brothers in the confederate
army. Did you know him before the v
war?"
"Yes," answered the other, looking 9
again in the direction of the house.
"I knew him very well. We were in
p the same class at the University of r
Virginia. Rivals first for class leader- q
ship, and later for the hand of the
fairest woman in the old common
wealth. Langhorne got the girl, who. o
by the way, was of northern birth. e
Perhaps that accounts for his fighting t
sympathies. Ilis people are all on the
other side. JIe lives in this section
somewhere, I believe. As to his
bravery, I never considered him brave I
at all. You will say at once, general,
that this is a prejudice arising from
our early relations. Not so. I am not
inclined to depreciate Langhorne's i
war record, which we all admit is
splendid. I say simply that he is not
a man of great physical courage."'
During; the brief recital the general's
face wore a smile of innocent raillery,
but as WVhite concluded, a stern ex
pression stole over his countenance.
He thrust his field glasses into a sil
ver-bound case, and almost fiercely
beat the long leg of his cavalry boot
with a pair of heavy gauntlets, which
he had taken off a few moments be
fore. lie was a man of imperious dis
position and violent temper, with lit
tle liking for opposition from any
source. White was a distant relative
and trusted adviser, but it was evident
that he had gone too far. VWhen the
first flush of his wrath had been beaten d
out upon his boot, he was enabled to ii
speak, with some degree of modera- C
tion, the thoughts that had sent a e
wicked expression to his face. ti
"Col. White," he began, deliberately, c1
"you impugn the courage of one of the
bravest men in the service-a man
whom I have learned to love and re
spect. I tell you he is as brave as a
lion, and his courage is always tem
pered with the coolest judgment-the
very highest form of courage. Do you
remember the day at-" s
Here the general broke off abruptly,
and drawing out the field glasses, fixed
his sight upon the house that stood on t
a long stretch of level land below,
whence rose at frequent intervals
white puffs of smoke, telling of the
cannonade still furiously waged from h
the mortars of the confederate bat
tery. In a moment he broke off his
inspection, and turning to Col. White,
said:
"IPerhaps your suggestion of the
Gap as a point of action is not so bad
after all. I really do not see any way
out of it, and just to prove that I am
right. I shall order Capt. Langhorne
in there. Some one has to go, and I
am convinced that Langhorne has the
right kind of stuff in him. He can
wipe away the arrogant conceit of
military prowess in three or four hun
dred confederate hearts, and at the
same time wipe away the arrogant
conceit of snap judgment in the heart
of a brother officer," and Gen. Colby I
again smiled good naturedly upon his th
staff officer. a
Whether this sudden change ofth
opinion came from an honest convic
tion of military necessity, or from the ,
motive of vindicating an insolent dc
judgment that was wont to consider
itself infallible, we are not to judge.
Men have been slaughtered before,
and will be again, without apparent a
motives of any kind.
Calling his orderly and pointing to a si
group of mounted offia.sers that rested '.
on a little knoll three or four hundred is
yards away, he said:
'"Tell Capt. Langhorne to come here ,
at once."
The orderly saluted and withdrew.
Gen,. Colby looked at his watch, nerv- C
rously. slapping the neck of his black
mare with the bridle rein: "We shall
now see," he muttered half aloud, -.
"who is qualified to weigh the qual- th
ties of a soldier." Col. White, who Ac

toushed his cap. His appearance was
not -0oP0deif. though he sat his hore.
well.; His long blond hair framed a
face of delleate refinement, which was
lighted up by blue eyes that might
have belonged to a woman. He wore
his soiled forage cap a little to one
I aide, and his blouse was open for a
n space of three buttons at the top, ez
, posing a white shirt front, and a silk
handkerohief of the same color bound
d about his throat.
d Gen. Colby looked first at Col. White,
r then frigidly returned the salute of the
young captain.
a "Capt. Langhorne!" he 'aegan, and
r his voice trembled slightly. "It is nee
- essary that those devils at yonder
house should be dislodged Take your
,. battery to the gorge directly in their
L front, known as Clipper Gap. It is
G narrow, and you will be able to use
only one gun at a time. In getting
r your position follow the ravine where
e we were this morning as far as possi
ble. it will afford some 'cover."
L, The captain looked straight at his
n commander. The commander looked
straight at his captain. Col. White
? looked straight into his own soul.
1. Capt. Langhorne broke the silepce.
,. "Pardon me, general, did ybu say
y Clipper Gap? Did I understand the
t order to open fire on the house oppo
a site the gorge?"
"Capt. Langhorne, is not my order
a clear?"
8 "Yes, sir, quite clear, but I wanted
o to ask if-if-it is absolutely necessary
e -if--er-er-"
"- "Yes," thundered the general, "the
y order is imperative. Are you a cow
e ard? Have you-" but in the midst of
this furious tirade Capt. Langhorne
again respectfully saluted, and then
r galloped away to execute the order of
L his chief.
M Soon the notes from a bugle floated
over from the rear and right, and the
two officers turned to see Langhorne's
a battery sweep at full gallop across a
3 gentle depression directly in the rear,
and then disappear behind the high
i hills that skirted the ravine. Once
s more they come in sight as they left
the ravine, and debouching in the
open, plunge full in the tace of the
enemies' guns, into the mouth of the
gorge, unlimber, and go into action.
f Then from the house, now less than
a thousand yards away, twelve hither
to silent pieces opened their brazen
mouths, carrying death and desolation
into the ranks of the federal battery.
In twenty minutes the horses had all
been killed or disabled. Then the
guns were run up by hand, discharged
and by the same method returned for
loading. The slaughter was fearful,
and in this vortex of fire and blood
and death all order was soon forgote
ten. There was only two things to do
-load and fire. And they did that
well, many dying in the doing, but all
believing, no doubt, that. it was very
glorious to die for one's flag and coun
try.
The fire of Langhorn's men nas
rapid and accurate, as attested by fre
quent changes in position of some of
the confederate guns, and by the si
lence of others. About sunset the fire i
of the. opposing forces ceased altogeth
er, and ten minutes later six men (all
that were left of the federal battery)

IT WAS A VICTORY DiEARLY BOUO;IT. C
dragged their weary and wounded
limbs into the heavy undergrowth that
covered the slopes of the gorge on
either side. Some went to rest with C
the hope of recovery, and others to
die. t
It. was victory clearly bought.
Two hours later, having dined com
fortably at his headquarters, after a
sending a detachment over to the Gap E
with the purpose of looking for the 8
dead and wounded, Gen. Colby, with a
Col. White and another member of his 1
staff, rode down to the house which B
had borne the bruntof the federal fire,
and from which the confederates had
hastily retreated, simultaneously with a
the discharge of their last gun. There i
was ruin everywhere about the place,
which was apparently deserted. Only
the shell of what a few hours before
had been a fine old residence of colo
nial architecture now remained to tell P
of the cruel ravages of war. All about E
were evidences of easy living, marking
the dismantled habitation as the home B
of a wealthy planter. After a walk c
about the place for nearly half an hour. II
some one mentioned the cellar, and the l
general, who was not half a bad com
mander in exploring wrecked southern b
homes, nodded assent. V
The o-derly made a torch, and, light- a
ing it, led the way down to the cellar,
which the visitors.were much surprised
to find already lighted. An oil lamp S
burned brightly from the top of a bar- t:
rel, and in a far corner of the room,
upon a heap of debris, a tallow candle g
threw its unsteady rays upon the dead o
and mangled bodies of two female fig- v
ures that lay upon the floor. Close to ii
them a man was seated upon a low p
camp-stool. His face was black, save h
where a stream of blood, trickling n
down from an ugly gash over the tem- d
ple, had washed the darker stains a
away. As the officers approached G(en.
Colby asked: "Who are you and what u
are you doing here?" $
"I have a perfect right to be here, tl
sir," answered the blood-stained man. F
"I own the property about here. This y
is my home." a
"And these bodies?" questioned the F
commander. S
