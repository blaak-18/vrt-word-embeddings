Portland, Ore., !tarch 25.-Not since
the fierce Hlghbinder fight, fifteen
years ago, when several Chinamen
were killed in Chinatown, has the
Chinese section of this city been in
such a state of uproar and excitement
Two leading Highbinder associations
of the city have declared open war
fare, and two more leading societies
are fast being drawn into the trouble.
The Po Ling Tong and Bo On Tong
societies are leaders in the fight, and
are making preparation. to contest
to the bitter end. Fifteen Chinese of
fighting fame arrived here from As
toria Sunday night, to be on hand
when the trouble comes to a head. As
toria Chinamen belong mostly to the
Po Lin Tong, and it is said the Bo On
Tong have sent to San Francisco for
a delegation of Highbinders. The Hop
Sing Tong and Sui Sing Ton, leading
societies of Portland, thus far have
refused to be drawn into the dispute.
Chinese thronged police station
Monday night and told tales of fear to
the police. The chief of police inform
ed them he would have a double pa
trol in Chinatown until the trouble is
abated.

isville, Ky., on a vacation. Miss Wag
gy fired five shots at McDannaald, two
of which took effect in the side and
one in the back, either one of which
the doctors will cause death.

sued McDannaald in the circuit court

this had ended the matter, but she
