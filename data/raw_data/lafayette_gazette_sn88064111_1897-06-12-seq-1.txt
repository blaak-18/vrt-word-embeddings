AT SCOTT
News Items Picked Up by The Gazette
Correspondent.
Scott was, comparatively speak
ing, deserted last Sunday. All the
folks participated in the amuse
ments at Lafayette. Ye scribe
had to remain alone.
We were delighted and felt highly
honored to think that our Rayne
friends still have small spots in
their noble hearts left for us.
Messrs. E. Daboval, Jr., Mark
Summers, Jack Bonin, W. Fonte
not, Chas. Daboval, Henry Mc
Bride, Ernest Levy, A. Terrians,
Dr. R. C. Webb, Aug. Crouchet
and the Jovial R. J. C. Bull paid us
a pleasant visit while on their way
to Lafayette last Sunday.
The meeting last Saturday was
well attended, and from all appear
ances we will be blessed with a
church in the near future.
It was moved,. seconded and
carried that a grand tournament
will take place in Scott on July z4,
for the benefit of the proposed new
church. As the members of the
several committees are energetic,
we have no doubt the affair will go
through with success. A church
would mean a great deal to Scott,
as the distance is rather great at
present to walk in order to attend
divine services.
We are informed by our friend,
A. J., that Dr. Girard, who is now
sojourning in Cameron with other
friends, captured a monster fish, 40
feet wide. As the fish is such a
monster, they have been unable so
far to ascertain its length. We
have no doubt the monster was
hard to capture and Dr. Girard will
have a long one to relate on the
fish subject.
Scott still holds her own and is
growing slowly. Orl-oN.
The following are the proceed
ings of the meeting held last Satur
day in the interest of the new
church:

use their influence toward building a
worthy edifice.

THE MEETING
Held at Falk's Hall Thursday
Night Was Entertaining and
Instructive.
Probably one of the most enter
taining and instructive popular
meetings in connection with the
Summer Normal now in session at
this place was held last Thursday
evening at Falk's opera-house. A
very large and intelligent audience
assembled on short notice evidenc
ing very strongly the deep interest
aroused in the pullic mind upon
the subject of education through
the instrumentality of the distin
guishededucators in charge of the
institute.
t Dr. T. B. Hopkins, president of
the parish School Board, called the
-meeting to order. Dr. G. A. Mar
tin then addressed the audience
upon the subject of education.
The doctor paid eloquent tribute to
the efforts now being made to ad
vance the cause in our midst, and
while admitting the unpleasant fact
as to the educational standing of
Louisiana in the sisterhood of
States, found grounds for congratu
lation in the wonderful impetus
now being given along this line
throughout the State. The vital im
portance of education was dwelt
upon, and compulsory laws advo
cated. Dr. Martin was heartily
applauded at the conclusion of his
address.
Prof. A. L. Smith was then
called upon, and in his usual happy
style favored the assemblage with
a most interesting and instructive
talk on "Child Study and Mother
Clubs." The learned professor
drew from his own rich experience,
as an educator, to illustrate his ar
guments in advocacy of child stud'
and the formation of mother clubs.
The culpable negligence of parents,
due to utter ignorance of the most
ordinary principles of mental and
physical development, was too of
ten responsible for defects and de
formities in the child, which in af
r ter years would blight the useful
ness and enjo)ment of life. Apt
t and forcible examples were intro
duced in support of the position
f taken and there can be no doubt
that beneficial results will flow from
the impressions and convictions
made.
The feature of the evening, how
ever was a lecture delivered by Miss
Clara Baer, of New Orleans, on
"'Physical Culture." This graceful
and charming advocate of physical
development and training began by
making an apology for the promi
nence and importance attached to
the subject of physical culture, by
many considered new and really
ante-dating the christian era by
some three thousand years, having
been practiced at that early time by
the Chinese. By classical allusions
the distinguished young lady showed
the wonderful effects of the science
in the physical and intellectual
development of ancient Greece.
A strong plea was entered
for this culture, not for the purpose
of developing animals of the Cor
bett and Fitzsimmons type, but to
t furnish the proper foundation for
moral and mental development on
the principle of a sound mind in a
sound body. Miss Baer's lecture
i was replete with apt illustrations
shown from personal experience and
Sobservation and was most enthusi
astically applauded.
Supt. Latiolais on behalf of the
I audience requested a recitation of
:Miss Baer, who gracefully complied
by rendering in her own inimitable
style "Mammy's Baby." The
young lady's elocution was only
a surpassed by her exquisite concep
tion of the character personified.
To those familiar with that rare
t specimen of of ante-bellum days,
I the good old block mammy, the
portrayal touched the tenderest and
>most appreciative sense. So de
Slighted was the audience that Miss
Baer was encored and responded
by reciting the experience of a
young school marm In teaching
elocution, the story being founded
on Longfellow's poem, ",I Stood
on the Bridge ,at Midnight."
The teacher's error in adapting one
recitation to all pupils, regardless
of their various qualifications, was
most ludicrously presented and
elicited storms of applause. The
audience laughed into tears over
the graphic portrayal of the faiiings
and short-comings of children, due
in a large measure to the egregious
mistakes on the part of teachers.
The entertainment of the evening
was much enhanced by the musical
selections rendered by Misses
Richard, Martha Mouton, Lea
Gladu and Lizzie Mudd.
It is understood that several more
popular meetings will be held ant
those so unfortunate as to have been
absent last Thursday evening would
do well to attend in the future.
The entertainment given last
Monday night by the pupils of
Mount Carmel convent was a very
creditable affairs. The girls and
boys who took part in the perform
ance did very well. The program
was well selected and splendidly ren
dered.
The Teachers Entertained.
On Thursday afternoon the
Misses Mudd and Mrs. Darling en
tertained the faculty and visiting
teachers of the Summer Normal.
Miss Baer introduced her new
game "Newcombe"; the sides were
"Bronze" and "Blue"; captains,
Dr. Girard and Mr. Keeney;
scorer, Mr. B. Clegg. When the
limited time had expired the points
on both sides were equal, in the
tinal contest the Blues gained by a
small majority. The "Newcombe"
is entirly original with Miss Baer.
It is novel, interesting and well
worth learning. After partaking of
refreshments, several games of ten
nis followed, so the hours of the
afternoon were pleasantly whiled
away.
A Horse-thief Captured.
Alexander Azore, a fleet-footed
and light-fingered son of the dark
continent, who bade "au revoir,
buft not good-live" to Constable
Hirsch about six months ago has
returned to Lafayette under the
chaperonage of Sheriff Broussard.
The sheriff heard that Azore was
enjoying the gulf breeze on the
coast in St. Mary parish and a few
days ago he brought his pleasures
to a ralnfully abrupt end. When
Azore saw the sheriff he readily
consented to accompany him home.
The officer asked the wily coon why
he did not repeat his performance
and take to his heels as he had done
before. He replied that this time
he happened to be between Ike and
the deep, blue sea and he thought
the wisest plan was to surrender.
Azore is wanted for horse
stealing.
The Outgoing Council.
"Well done, good and faithful
servants," may be truthfully said of
the members of the outgoing Coun
cil. The Gazette says, without fear
of successful contradiction, that
since the incorporation of this
town, a better and more intelligent
Council has never administered its
affairs. It went into office with the
fixed determination to do its duty
and it has done it well. It has
been absolutely free from any bos
sism and if for no other reason it
deserves a world of credit for the
independence it has always shown.
The administration of the financial
business of the town has been ad
mirable. Every cent collected has
been accounted for. Every month
the financial condition of the town
was given to the public in the
Council proceedings, and at all
times it was within the power of
every tax-payer to know how the
books were.
We have carefully watched the
couise pursued by the members of
the retiring Council and we believe
that we are doing them but simple
justice in stating that it has never
obeen the good fortune of the people
of Lafayette to have their munici
pal affairs administered by better men
whose every official act was an ex
Semplification of their belief in the
I great truth uttered by Ex-President
SCleveland that ",public office is a
Spublic trust."
THE NEW COUNCIL.
The First Monthly Meeting Held
-Officers are Elected.
The newly-elected City Council
held it first monthly meeting Mon
day evening and transacted a large
amount of business. The first thing
that was done was the election of
officers to serve during the ensu
ing term. For secretary there was
only one name presented; it was
that of Sterling Mudd who was unan
imously elected. Messrs. Baxter
Clegg, D. V. Gardebled and Gus.
Schmulen sent in applications for
the office of treasurer. Mr. Clegg
was the victorious candidate. Mr.
Clegg was the secretary of the out
going Council. Mr. Danton J. I
Veazey was the only candidate for I
marshal and he received the votes
of all the councilmen. The Adver
tiser and Gazette were made the
official journals of the town on a 1
joint bid.
A resolution was introduced em- 1
powering the town marshal to ap- I
point three policemen and a deputy
tax-collector. The resolution
passed the Council, but Mayor Caf
fery vetoed it and it failed to be
come a law. Action upon the
mayor's veto was deferred to a
future meeting. Should the resolu
tion be adopted there will be one of
ficer to attend to the collection of
taxes and for his services he will
receive the commission allowed by
law. The Gazette thinks this
would be a very satisfactory ar
rangement as the collection of the
town's revenues would receive
the undivided attention of one
person and the chief of police
would be in a position to
devote all his time to his
duties as a peace officer. The re
solution provides for the payment
of the three policemen out of a
monthly appropriation of $zoo.
The Gazette believes that it is
impossible for two men to properly
police this town. Two men for the
day and two for the night is, we
believe, necessary to preserve the
peace and insure protection to all
the citizens. It is not in the power
of two men to do the work.

CAIENCRO NEWS.
Items of Interest Gathered by The
Gazette Correspondent at
Carencro.
Misses Estell and Agnes Guil
beau ate attending the Summer
Normal at Lafayette.
The Grand Coteau band was in
town during the week serenading
Carencro friends. The courtesy
and the good music were much ap
preciated.
Miss Pellerin, of Breaux Bridge,
is visiting Miss Rita Jeanmard.
Aristide Francez, Zackery Fran
cez, Louise and Hector Prejean,
pupils of the State Normal School,
have returned for their vacation.
An enjoyable surprise party was
given on Saturday night, at the
residence of Mrs. Galbert Guilbeau
by the young people of the town,
who were so pleased by their success
that there is talk of a speedy repe
tition of the same pleasure.
Dr. E. J. Perrault is visiting in
New Orleans.
Miss Mercedes Broussard, of La
fayette, passed the day with Miss
Sarah Brown on Monday.
A number of Carencro people
took advantage of the convenient
schedule on the branch to visit La
fayette on Sunday to meet the ex
cursion from New Orleans; there
were also many vehicles on the
road, loaded with pleasure-seekers.
The weather was beautiful, Lafa
yette and her people were in gala
attire, amusements were provided in
full for guests, and a most pleasur
able day was spent.
Mr. and Mrs. Aristide Dugal, of
Balwin, were visitors to Mrs. Dimi
try last week.
Improvements are going on stead
ily. Mr. A. C. Guilbeau is having
his residence entirely renovated, and
the front completely changed. Mr.
Edmond Villere is superintending
the work in the carpenter line,
while Mr. Felix Villere has charge
of the painting and papering.
Mr. IV. A. Robert has made
much improvement on his mother's
place.
Mr. H. Crouchet's saloon build
ing is also being greatly Improved.
Mr. Henry Micand having charge
of the work.
Mr. L. A. Veazey has started on
the new store of Sibille Brothers.
This will be a building measuring
45 by 6o feet. The entire lower
front will be taken up with large
show windows, and receding glass
entrance; the building will be sub
stantial and erected on strictly
modern lines. . The front of the
second story will be of ornamental
iron. This floor will be properly
equipped for theatricals and public
amusement. The rear portion will
be divided into two rooms-one will
be used as an ante-room, while the
other will be occupied by the Ata
kapas Club. A large gallery will
run the full width in front, and
there is no doubt that when com
pleted the building will prove quite
an ornament to our town.
The "Atakapas Club" was or
ganized a couple of week since, and
the following officers elected to
serve for the ensuing year. Presi
sident, C. C. Brown; vice-presi
dent, O. P. Guilbeau; secretary,
C. F. Latiolais; treasurer, E. J.
Perrault; governing committee, Dr.
W. W. Lesley, L. G. Stelly and D.
A. Dimitry.
Our public school building might
hold its own in a Mexican adobe
village, but it certainly cuts a very
sorry figure in such a progressive
and wide awake town as Carencro.
Being situated in the most central
part of the place, it stands out as
architectural night-mare, and holds
its own as the ugliest structure that
persists in attracting the weary eye.
Our energetic school superinten
dent will do all he can to relieve us
of our peculiar little school house,
and it is to be sincerely hoped that
he may be supported in his efforts
by the School Board, and the
people.
Crop are in very fair condition.
The recent rain shower came "just
in the nick o'time."
At a meeting of the Town Coun
cil recently elected, the following

beau; street commissioner, Odon
Guidry; town marshal, St. D. Ar

THE COTTON FRAUD.
Daily States.
In the Senate yesterday Mr. Vest
campared the Democrats in that
disgraced body to a convention of
monkeys whose deliberations were
suddenly thrown into a wild
scamble when a few nuts were
thrown into the cage. The Senate
today is, indeed, a sad spectacle
for Democrats to witness. The Re
publicans stand solidly like a band
of well-trained highwaymen, while
the Democrats resemble a lot of sneak
thieves, each hunting alone in the
by-ways and slums to pick up some
swag. About the biggest traud
that has been or can be perpetrated
in tariff legislation was the duty
yesterday levied upon imported
cotton. That amendment was of
fered by Senator Bacon, of Georgia,
and instantly snapped up by the
Republicans, who wanted to put
the Democrats in a hole, and by
Southern Democratic protectionists
(God save the mark!) who wanted
to propitiate the cotton planters,
whom they have outraged and be
trayed by voting with the Republi
cans. Millions of pounds of our
cotton are exported and the price
fixed necessarily in the market of
import. The contention that Egyp
tian cotton is a rival in our ports of
American cotton is nonsense of the
baldest kind, and was only intended
to bamboozle the cotton planters
and make care of their interests,
and no doubt there are some of
them silly enough to be captured
by the fraud. As a matter of fact,
the only effect of a duty on cotton
is to give the manufacturers an ex
cuse, a fraudulent excuse it is true,
but still an excuse, to raise the
price of cotton goods on the Ameri
can consumers. Thus, the scheme
is a double villainy-a villainy in
deluding the American producers
of cotton and a robbery of the
American consumers of cotton
goods.
The cotton planters are a body
of intelligent American citizens.
They do not want government aid;
they are willing to rely upon their
own intelligence, energy and enter
prise. But they do not desire to
be robbed of their earnings to fat
ten dealers in hides and sugar and
wool and coal and iron. Give
them freedom of trade, untaxed
commodities and banking facilities
that will enable them to operate on
six or eight per cent, and they will
be content and keep out of the ring
of tariff robbers.
A Fire-bug Caught.
Over a year ago a negro named
Eloi Daniels was charged with the
crime of arson, but he succeeded to
escape from the parish before he
could be arrested by the officer in
whose hands the warrant had been
placed. Daniels managed to keep
out of the law's way up to a few
days ago, when Sheriff Broussard
discovered his whereabouts and ar
-rested him. The sheriff believes
that it can be shown that Daniels is
the fellow who burned a house for
Mr. B. P. Landry near Royville
and a barn belonging to Mr. P. B.
Roy. Daniels is said to be a dan
gerous charicter and his capture
Swill be learned with satisfaction by
the people of that section where he
- pursued his nef: rious occupation.
