We learn that the greatest govern

It will be msen from the published

San Acceasst. - We learn that
while out coon hunting, Mr. Samuel
Sheppard, who is well known here,
was killed by a fall from a tree which
he bad ombed to knoak out a coon.
The fall was fifty feet and the jar was
so terrible that both his arms and
legsop were broken, falling ib seems
upon his .hands and feet. He lived In
great agony for twenty-four hours.
This is sad indeed, and we deeply
sympathibs with his family In their
bereavement. Mr. Sheppard bas
many friends here, and was one of
our best soldiers in Virginia during
the late war. Peace to his ashes.

The Only Danger.
In to-day's issue we copy from our
: able and popular contemporary, the a
Shreveport ibses, oa artiele which so C
aptly fits our case that we eannot re
frain from asking for it a careful and hi
attentive perusal.
Recent events have transpired in of
our city since the fall of the mighty
ring, that have led us to believe the
sin of Bourbonism, that of learning to
o nothing, forgetting nothing, can be
o applied as well to younger, and more or
vigorous political bodies than the il
I "last ditch" element of the Democra.
o cy. This belief is made manifest by
the "suggestions" of men, whose mo- th
r tives no one impugns, for we believe de
them to be pure and patriotic; that t
at this time the condition of the
country was such, the mind of the ei
colored man being in a plastic con- at
dition, and the masses without ap- fo
parent leaders in whom they could o
* place confidence; advantage might
a be taken of it, and by oar people go. L
ing over to them, the negro could be
used in future to insure good govern
meat. But our people have been, ra
and these men should be, long since g
a convinced from actual trial of the in
vain fallacy of longer putting trust in ed
the promises of the Republican lead- in
en, and of controlling negro votes in at
any way, but by .n appeal to their fe
worst passions, or their basest fears. i,
- Have we not since 1867, endeavored th
by all the means within our power, to le
a bring them to a true and proper dense t
1 of their duties as citizens to the coun- t,
t try, our promises to them were all I,
s that men could make, and in some cc
instances, that of unification; we ex- 4
tended all bounds of reason, and sa
1 sank the pride and honor of the white C
t race in an endeavor to avert a dirct bi
Sissue; an issu we we felt the ignorant fe
- black man -would draw on by the b,
false teachings of their thieving lead- na
e- , and these attempts have all met
the same fate. The egro has turned ee
from our promises with mr on his D,
face and hatred in his heart towards
us, and drunk in the damnable teach- .
logs of the Carpet-bag and Scalawag cl1
office seekers, until bis pigmy reason id
l overcome with promises of the booty ,
and beauty of the whites, he has sunk
to the level of a beast and has been
used for naught but the basest par. th
poses. It is too late now to re-open co
the pros and aons of a dead lease, m
that line of policy has been essayed to
more than once, and the same fate as
awaits its renewal.
P There has been too omuch of this O0
r casting away good and permanent ns
Sresults to try experimental policies, cil
f and this one as proposed has been r
. tested in all its forms, from a pledge tb
on oar partl, from adescent to a mix- th
tare of oar children with theirs at tj
s our public shoolsh to a nomination all
I and support of their beat sad repro- d
Ssentstive men for our most honorable b
a sad lunrative oLces. The aegro does t
a not desire us with him, his mind s
r semt upon one thing, the social degra- a
a dation of oar race, and to gain tha it

' Learn Nothing. ForgetNothlng. P
The few old party hacks who have si
ruled and ruined the Democratic or. ji
u ganimation in our State, seem defiant h
ie in their attitude towards the express. a
' ed will of the country parishes, and a
- in a letter addressed to Gov. McEnery I
° and others, in response to the mani- a
Ir festo of citizens of north Louisiana, e
s" "unhesitatingly decline" to rescind h
d the call for a Convention in New Or
a leans, and further show their band in1
1 the last clause of the letter, in which
. the committee expect' "that the op- b
11 position manifested to the policy of p
18 conducting this campaign Under the ti
" ai(qpi*e oftAs Democratic party, will a
d subside," and that as in 1868, all the a
C onservatives will rally under its tl
t banner. We san hardly express our v
t feelings at such a letter, and to see it a
1e backed up by the Btlltim surprises i
as more. The same spirit that has a
Sactuated the old Bourbon element, a
d seems to "move" the iesbers of this b
SDemocrate Committee, and they a
maunt In the faces of the couantry eii-i p
son the ultimatum of the New Orleans ci
C clique, that this shall be a Democrat- tl
° l&eampaig, and all opposition must
subside. This is decidedly cool, to h
k say the least of it, and we can only i
speak for our parish when we say
that.the spirit of this self constitated a
° connection will be met in a proper e
manner by Us. We adU Aa.e otkag n
Sto do sih tle Democratle 1 or party,
and if this selfish biggotry is to be ii
continually shown us by the New p
s Orleans Democracy, in our hours of t

Van Duzen on the War Path. I
HIS WARRIORS ASSEIBLING I
Paint and Powder.
Van Dozen, the pedagogical carpet- j
bag Justice of the Peace for the 3d t
ward, by the grace of Kellogg, seems h
to be on the war path. At least he is
making or preparing to make, one of ,
the Republkcs' "demonstrations," in
the shape of an armed body of negroes. t
We learn that be had a parade a few
days sines attended with the usual
minutia of an army, pickets, videttes
ite. One gentleman travelling along
the public high-way was peremptorily
halted and told he could not travel
that road by one of the Myers-Van b
Dozen out-posts. The gentleman
saw the force, amounting to about
two hundred armed negroes. What
does this mean t War and nothing
else. Let a put a stop to this fel
low's acts once for all : if he cannot
live among us and conduct himself
peacefully he must be made to do so
or leave. Mr (t) Van Dozen, we have
stood such stuff as armed parades
just aslong as we intend to, and you
had better have a care bow you try
us, you may go too far and then you
will have to bear the consequences.
We advise the gentlemen of the 3d
ward to wait upon this would-be gen
eral and learn what is the meaning of
his conduct.
Have We A 0Ne Seeker Amog Us t o
We have been asked this question a
by men, whom we had reason to sup
pose would never apply any but pa- b
triotic motives, to a movement so
sweeping and so successtful as the one
now inaugurated in our Parish. Still
the query has been propounded and
we naturally turn to ourselves for an
answer--to look over the field and see
if we have done aught to merit such
an imputation, and we are proud to
say that such is not the case; that we
have done nothing to require such an
assertion; and we find ourselves pre
pared to turn upon our accusers and
bharge them with the base motive in
their insinuations. e
Our community, from long practie, b
has been very, very conservative, and
it seems a wonder to some that old 0
Natchitoehes should become so bold 0
and defiant as she is. Her action has
struck terror to the hearts of her ene
mies, at the same time that it has de
privod the "trimmers" who are found
in all communities of opportunities to
ply their vocation. It was "killing
two birds with one stone," and our
silent friends in casting about for
something to ost upon, barve succeed
ed in discovering a hags mosse, in a
sacces brought about without their
amistance, and that i, that we are
looking for olcial pap ourselves.
We cannot finad words to eozpress the
indignation of our people, ast such a
fooullander, and the base mind that
could conceive no higher, mobler moe.
tive for his fellow-eitsens, than that
they are actuated by sch a sordid do
she, isbeneath the contempt even of
our enemies. This is but the weak
ery of a mme ma, who did not pos
-ea the mahbood to show himself
when his services were required sad
because he was t cowardly to do I

Primary Elections vs. Convny- C
tions.
With the reforms to be inaugurated
by the white people of the State of
Louisiana, comes that of a revolution
in the manner of selecting candidates I
to represent us in the eontest now at a
hand. We mean that of a primary *
election in place of a convention, and
we see that several of the north a
Louisiana journals speak in favor of
the former.
The primary election although at
tended with some little trouble is the
most feasible way by which a full ex
pression of a majority of the people
can be had in the matter of selecting
such candidates as are most accepta
ble to a majority. Conventions have
heretofore stood charged with "pack
ing and favoritism," and although
some chances in the new feature of
nominations exist for "packing," still
the people would be willing to give
f it a trial as something that eannot be
worse than the old hackneyed con
vention, of cut and dried nominations.
Let as have then a new way to nomi
nate, and new men with our new par
ty.
The plan briefly stated Ci this : as
soon after the State Convention as pos
sible, a primary election will be held
in the Parish and one or more boxes
r will be opened in each ward upon a
certain day or days, at which polling
places the voters of the party shall
Iast their ballots for a choice of the
parties as candidates, for such pees
as they may declare !themselves.
Each person who submits hisasame to
be voted for at the primary election
is to pledge himself to abide by the
result of such election, and the par
ties receiving the majority of votes
at this polling, yill be declared the
candidates for tie respective offices
for which they are named, in the en- I
suing fall election.
We are more particularly in favor
of this plan beeause we are from the
city of Natchitoches, and our people ti
have been charged, and we think un. b
justly, of exercising an undee lnAu- a
ence at the Conventions which have ca
been heretofore held in this parish. k
Let our citiseans think this matter v
over and select the best plan, and the b
one less susceptible of giving cause a
for discontent. a
