A CARD. ,
its the last issue okfthe 'afayette
Advertiser, in a card, signed by th
Mayor and some members of the
City Coancil of Lafayette, t -
son given by theselgentlem
not having offered he p rit
-i~g of the town to the I bhld-,
4em is: "that it came to eteiP .*orot
edge froam a reliable source that The
Gazette had" proposed to the Ad
wertiser to combine for kie public
printing, by way -of bids between
them and to divide the spoilr."
The card of the Mayor and others,
waoes .not name this reliable infor
wssat; but in an editorial in the
-ame issue of the Adveritiser, A. C.
+ rdL y, -editor of that paper, has
rtfitted that he was the reliable
''mformant of the City Council, and
.says that said proposition was made
by me; therefore, this card is ad
dressed to A. C. Ordway, editor of
taWe Lafayette Advertisr._ I did
ausk him to put in a joint bid for the
public printing, and to divide the
price which the City Council was,
.and is always free to allow or to re
ject, bid or no bid. There was no
'mentioa made of the price for which
we would undertake the printing.
My idea was if the City Council
would agree to give $S5o for the
contract, the proceedings and or
'dinances would be published alike
in The Gazette and in the Atdver
tiser and that each paper would get
half of the price allowed by the
Council. And this proposition was
-made in the face of the fact that we
had been warned that it woukld not be
acceded to. This proposition was
refused by the editor of the Adver
tiser. I then asked the Coun
cil to put the public printing to the
lowest bidder, my intention being
to take the contract for less than
-$5o, and much less.
Now, if A. C. Ordway has, (and
i believe that he has) told or insi
'lnated,to the members of the Coun
cil of Lafayette, that I had pro
posed to him to enter into a com
bine or scheme to fleece and rob the
town treasury by a kind of black
mail with him, or that the joint bid
proposed by me was to exceed Sr5o,
the amount given to the Advertiser
for the public printing, and then
divide the spoils and booty with
him, I say that such an assertion
or insinuation, is false, malicious
and untrue, and that the man who
has utterred or made it, is purely
and simply a slanderer and liar.
I-OMER J. MOUTON.
ONE WORD MORE.
In the last issue of the Advertiser
the city fathers who voted to give
the public printing without putting
it to the lowest bidder, and the
Mayor (who by the way did not,
and could not vote on the question,
and the councilman who voted both
ways) have published a card, at
tempting to justify their action in
the premises. In that card, among
bther very wise things, they say:
"We acknowledge under different
efrcdimstances the public printing
should have been given to the lowest
bidder, but undler the conditions that
existed at the time, we think our
constituents will agree with us in the
kay we acted. On the morning-be
fore we met to organize and elect
our different officers, it came to our
hknowledge from a r/izable source
that a proposition from The Gazette
to the Advertiser to combine for the
public printing by way of bids be
tween them and divide the spoils,
all of which was refused by the Ad
tertiser. We do not know what
this combinatIon might have cost
e ceorpration had it been eff~ected;
it evidently was not for the purpose
of dividing the ten dollars alluded
to *o the acticle of The Gazette. It
s maore likely that irstead of paring
frSo per antrnum which was the price
padl for years for ostr public printing,
Mad we might Aav'e bent forced to pay
dabrs tMe amount, ete., etc., (Italic
The statement that they were in
Isrmed that that proposition had
been made to the Ader,'rtiser, and
O at it was refused bylhe Adrertiser,
coupled to the fact that an editorial
gplafied in English in.that same
suae, oan the same subject matter,
be~ conclusion is irresistible that the
elatable (?) informant was A. C.
l erray, its editor.
In that "editorial the following
passage -occurs : ",That we (the Ad
vertiser) would not print the pro
ceedings for a "less skuim than $so
per annum, and that as'the council
had not called for bids none would
be put in by the Advertiser unless
called on -to-dlo so by the -coun
cil. T'hat $150 was a fair price for
the work ** ; and if the council
asks for bids, ours (the Advertiser's)
would be for that amount, and not
for a cent less.'"
If there is anything clear and to
the -point in all of the above, it is
that the'Advertiser would have done
or taken the -public printiag forr55o
atf 9dry 'least, had the council
ptt 'the 'lowest bidder. With
staring them in the face
d: eity fathers have had
ul -apprenhensions
about the ciLy treasury? How could
they say: "i of paying $x5o
per vanin 'mtlt a ne might have been
fore do a do hat amount."
D yo>irant to kl ? We hesitate
to say when we think under what
ss of mind, what emotions of ip
ation, and unde what feelings
ve responsibililas guardians
of th. public fundl the must have,
lahrdl rt was simel tCtause they
foIot at. under n ossibility
colu the poration ade to
pay more tan $I 'an be
cause they foraiA) . t put
it to the lowest bid dvltti
ser's bid would have been . o, and
not a cent less.
All we have to say about their
justification is that their intention
may have been good, but that their
memory must have been bad.~:~ /
COFPLJMENTAR Y TO TLE
GAZETTE.
From the first issue of The Ga
zette, we have been the recipients
of many kind words of encourage
ment approving the course of the
paper-some written, some verbal.
We have refrained from publishing
them, and only do so in this in
stance for satisfactory reasons.
The following letter was roceived
Tuesday and dated from Youngs
ville: .
Editor La.'yeti.c Gazette
Indeed it is with great satisfaction and un
told pleasure that we have watch the gradual,
but steady progress of your "go ahead"
paper, since it put an appearanuce in our
midst. It, so far, has unquestionably cov
ered every foot of ground, from "low" to
"high," with a something like conscious
nes~s, yet no special favoritism to any.
Therefore, as Jos. Jefferson says, if we re
member correctly, "May you live long, be
happy and prosperous." Fail not to send
us The Gazette when due. Yours and more
anon, A FRIRN'n.
Our readers will bear us out in
the statement that The Gazette has
not been given to "'tooting its
horn" on the slightest provocation,
preferring to let the paper stand or
fall on its own merits. Consequently
we have gone right on giving our
best efforts towards upbuilding the
town of Lafayette, as well as every
part of the parish, without, (to use
the words of "'A Friend,") "special
favoritism to any." This course,
has met the approbation of the gen
eral public. We thank our friend
for his kind words.
We are not surprised that the management
of The Gazette should feel a little disap
pointed in not getting the printing, but we
are surprised that they should have written
or published the last paragraph their article
contains, as it is misleading, and a great in
justice to the council, and must have been
published with the purpose of decceiving the
publlic.-Advertiser loth instant.
The statement that The Gazette
had the least "'purpose of deceiving
the public," is a lie pure and simple.
In Regard To Cotton.
BRotssaio, P. O. June 52, IS93.
Fditor Larfa~rettle Gaze':
Dear Sir-Inclosed please find a
circular mailed me by Harris, Day
&S Co., of New Orleans, which is
well worth consideration, study and
publication; it is high time that we
should ask a hearing of Congress in
regard to cotton, and have some re
lief. Now the question is opened
for discussion how shall we get that
needed relief? Shall we ask for
import duty on raw cotton or free
importation of cotton goods. In or
der to be placed on an equal foot
ing with American mannfacturers,
we should by right and jtustice get
one or the other, i. e. , duty on raw
cotton, or free importation on man
ufactured cotton goods.
Let the country press open the
discussion, and very soon we will
see the city press come out in assis
tance to their country brethren, and
give us ideas how to go to work in
order that we may be assured of a
hearing from Congress, and get sat
isfactory results therefroms
Yours truly,
J. O. BROUSSARD.
In Regard to Cotton.
It is to the interest of American Cottn-
producers that they shonuhl be informed that
the steady increase of importations of foreign
cotton into the United States is seriottusly af
fecting the Cotton interests of a large sec
tion of the South. If it were the result of
free and unrestricted competition between
Sour cotton growers and those of Peru and
Egypt. we should, perhaps, be forced to
bear thie consequences without objecting.
But w'e do ot~ect most strenuously to
furnish the pauper labor of the Nile witahi
means of entering our home territory, en
couraged and -ostered by our own laws to
drive us to the wall. Pampered and protee
ted to the utmost by tariff enactments, Ame
rican mill owners are mniters of the field for
the sale sf cotton goods to the people of the
United States. We are their forced custo
mers and -must buy from them whether we
will or not, simply because the United States
government charges foreign manufactures so
much for permission to bring their goods in
to this country for sale, that they cannot
enter our markets in competition with Amne
rican mills.
The difference between what we pay for
American goods and the price at which
foreign goods could be furnished to us, were
there eo restrictive tariff, amounts to many
milliion of dollars annually. These millions
represent actual forced contributions by the
agricultutal section to the support and enrich
ment of manufacturers. The result was that
last year while the American cotton planting
interests were unable to make both ends
meet, American cotton manufacturers were
abundantly supplied with cheap raw cotton
and realized handsomely paying prices for
their gowds.
Not satlified- with this, however, they are
looking for till cheaper markets in whichr to
obtain their raw material. and is they are of
the favored laess who are permitted to buy
in the cheapest and sell in the dearest
markets of the World, they are not only en
riching themselves out of our pockets, but
building their fortunes on our rains.
The importation of Egyptian and Peruvian
cotton not only affects the Sea Island pro
duction on the Atlantic sea-board, which
aggregates say sixty to seventy thousand
bales per amnnum, but has affected disastrous
ly the values of all of four hundred thousand
bales of the good and extrxa staple products
of the Missssippi Valley. Mills that pur
chased thousands of bales cf our hinders and
long staple cotton some years since have
, bought only a few hundred bales of the
American crop of 1S92, at small difference
for premium on current prices for common
run of staple. The tariff has run up the
pric of every yard of goods we consume
consjlerably over 5ooo1, lhfit is plain
thagU admission of long s til otton duty
free, our prodaers are cut down for those
desc*#tions of their product to prices that
are ruinous.
We do not w.sh to. argue from the stand
point of free trade and protection. All we
ask is to be placed on a level, as cotton
growers, with the people who buy our cotton
-in a word, if we are forced to trade with
t hem be forced to trade with us.
If on the other hand the restrictions are
removed, and our markets are thrown open
to the World, we are willing to take our
chances, but we have a right to insist that
until this is-done, we should be placed on an
equal footing; as am: agrulrt people,
with the manufacturers of the East.
We earnestly trust that formers and plan
ters throughout the Mississippi Valley. and
especially those in the bottom lands, will
place this matter before their members of
Congress, annt insist that we shall have jus
tice rendered to us in the premises.
All our people ask is a fair chance, and
we believe that Congress will readily see the
necessity for prompt action in that direction.
DRIVE TIEiI OUT.
The more firmly the present ad
ministration becomes settled in the
routine of duty, notes the Shreveport
Times, the more frequent the expo
sure of rottenness, crookedness,
fraud and corruption in every de
partment during the Harrison ad
ministration. It is now conspi
cuously apparent that the sole aim
of the Republican employes was to
secure funds, and there was- no
means considered too base, no trust
too sacred, no secret too profound,
no public interest too great, not to
be readily and willingly sacrificed
to the greed of gain. It was high
time, indeed, for honesty to invade
the temple of liberty and snatch the
scepter of power from the grasp -of
the horde of robbers and despoilers.
And the rascality discovered is
only limited to the number of em
ployes turned out. The whole kit
I from top to bottom will be ordered
to vacate,- sooner or later, and Dem
ocrats put in their place so that
I Democratic methods. shall prevail
in all departments.
COJIIERCL.4L GAAIBLING.
The history of France one hun
dred years ago is in danger of be
ing re-enacted in this land, and
from the same causes. The rob
bery and spoliation of the people
by the future gambling system is
working even more damage to the
South than the wrongs of the tariff
and silver demonetization combined.
Cotton men in different parts of
the South are fast coming to this
opinion. They have been consid
erably divided on the "future" ques
tion, but the course of the cotton
market for the past two months has
opened their eyes and forced them
to see. Prices have been forced
down a cents per pound within that
time, all the conditions of trade, all
the legitimate influences of the cot
ton market were decidely favorable
to higher values, and so recognized
by every intelligent cotton man.
But in spite of it all, and to the
amazement of our wisest cotton
dealers, prices have been forced
down about 2o per cent more in the
last two months-all through the
manipulation of futures by the Newr
York rings. This decline has cost
the South many millions and has
led to- failure of merchants all over
the South, the wrecking of banks,
increased stringency and depression
in business circles, and the finan
cial ruin of many individuals-all
because a gang of sharpers in New
York are permitted to work a vile
scheme by which they can drive the
market price of our cotton any way
they please. Oh, it is monstrous
that such things can be! And it is
astonishing that Southern legislators
stand by and give consent as some
did in the last Congress! It is be
yond conception why both United
States Senators from Texas aided
these robberies by their votes!

gest rush of job work this week, ne

GRANTS.
Rev. a. H. Patteson. of East Baton Rouge.
The sugsrz problem has been solved
in the central factory sOstem, wherel
the cane is bought from the surroun
ding country and manufactured on
a very large scale. This is found
to be so economical that the manu
facturer can afford to pay a good
price for the cane and yet make a
,go'od profit for himself, white thei
planter is well paid for his labor.
Cane yields from 15 to 50 tons per
acre, the yy:ld depending largely
upon the cultuire, this cane is worth
from $3 to $5 per ton, price depen
ding somewhat upon distance from
factory and the facilities. This year,
cane was bought for $3.75 and haul
.ed more than too miles by railroad.
Cane near the factories was sold as
high as $5:. * * * It'is easy to see
the profitt-that can be made. Any
good lands will bring from 2o to 30
tons .pes:acre. Any good worker
carn raiSj,. a,cres of cane and all
the other A ps of feed and vege
tables he needs, many do much
more. Thisctop is laid by in June,
so his crop is made before the hoet
weather comes on.
* * * *
Many planters do well if they get
$ to for thee whole proceeds of an
acre. Hay will bring from one to
five tons, and nowsells at from $x5
to $z5 in the market. Irish pota
toes produce two cropsa year. Cab
bage, lettuce, onions, etc., can be
had the year round with a little
care. Sweet potatoes grow in the
greatest abundance all over the
State. The yield is from 300 to
8oo bushels per acre. For feed,
two bushels of sweet potatoes are
equivalent to one bushel of corn.
There is no better need for hogs,
cattle and males, and horses do well
on them.
Now, think of a western farmer
raising 300 to 400 bushels of corn,
per acre and feeding hous at present
prices. Why, it would be better
than a gold mine. Its equivalent
can be prodiuced in Louisiana at
any time. I have tried it and know
whereof I affirm. I have also seen
many others do the same. If what
I have said be true, why have not
the people flocked here instead of
going to the cold Northwest coun
try and the home of the blizzards?
Simply and solely because, beeaause
they don't knowri it.

The Bradley-Ordway Affair..
LAFAYETrs,; IA., June 13, 1893.

Sir--Ilerewith We hand youi the statement
of the facts, in regard to the communication
addressed to ;ir. C. II. radley, lately
entrusted to us, ias they occurred. In order
-that you -y -ay fully wnderstand our acttcn,
we quote you- from the Louisiana Code of

of South Carolinia, as follows :
- CH-ArPTR I11.
2. L'pon- the acceptance of the challenge
the seconds make the necessary arrange
ments for the meeting, in which each party
is entitled to-perfect equality. The old no
tion that the party challenged was author
ized to name the place, distance and weap
on, has long since been exploded, nor would
a manr of chivalric honor use such a right if
he possessed it. The time must he as soon
as practicable, the place such as had ordina
rily been used where the parties are, the dis
tance usual, and the weapon that which is
most generally used which in this country is
the pistol.
3. If the challengee insist upon what is
not usual in time, place, distance and weap
on, do not yield the point, but tender in
writing what is usual in each, and if he re
fuses to give satisfaction, then your friend
may post him."
We are therefore under the neceessity of
advising you that you are at liberty to post
