My experience with the usie and sale of
Dr. Tichleuor's Antiseptic has Ieesl indleed
satisfactory. I can str.ugly endorse it
as a good nmeicdine,
W. O. HARRISON.
I have been liing )Dr, Tichlinor's An

mnend it as a most excellent fiunily meilli

For cults, Ihrns, bruises, etc.. there is

Dr. Tichenor's Antiseptic is so well and
favorably known throughout this section
that it hardly needs any reconmnendation.
I always carry it in stock and tinl it the
best seller I handle in that line.
J, W. DIYSON.
I have handled Dr. Ticheuor's Antiselp
tic for several years, and found it deci'.
edly the boat seller of its kind I evi r
saw. I have also handled the imitations
but the large majority of my trade pre
ferred Dr. Ticheuor's.
B. A. FORTSON.
