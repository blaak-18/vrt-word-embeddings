A TBZP TO THE SPEIÎT&S.
Laut week we made a short visit to
the Sulphur Springs in Catiihoulii Pur
isli, to join u piii tv win» liiul proceeded
us a low «lays. YW found tilings niiicli
livelier tliiin on llie occasion of a visit
to tut) weeks ago.
AT THE HOTEL
were Cnptnin JnmesG. White and fatn
, ilv, Mr. Fred. Seip aini Lady, Mrs. Jno
Weil, Mr*. 3. Sclimnlinski and Dr. H.
St.. John, from Alexandria. With the
family of Dr. Lovelace and other visi
tors there was quite an agreeable par
ty at the Hotel.
IN TIIE COTTAGES.
In a new and neat cottage close to
the hotel were Captain James Jeffries
and family, and in another a short dis
tance i»ff, were Mrs. C. H. Flower, Mrs
Spring and Dr. Tom Compton and
Family, nil from Rapides. This is a
■very agreeable way of spending »lie
time lit the Spring*, and will doubtless
be again an general as it was before
the war, when this was a very popular
summer resort for our citizens.
AT MltK. waiiu's
Are our le nien t and popular Tax Col
lector, Mr. Mieheal Lrgrasand Daught
er and our efficient President of the
Police Jury, Mr. J. W. Osborn. Mrs.
Ward lias a very largo, roomy and
comfortable house, with numerous fur
nished rooms which she rents at mod
erate prices. Altogether there is am
ple pleasant accommodations at the
Springs fora hundred persous or more.
FISHERMEN.
Besides those mentioned, there was
a merry party of young gentlemen from
Kapides, camped near the Springs com
posed of Messrs. HusSfl Rogers, Mur
iii y Hetlierwick, Pintard llynson,
Thomas Hynson and Doc. Flower.—
These young gentlemen were "in
town" as there were several young la
dies present with whoa* they enjoyed
quiet card parties, croquet, music etc.,
to the almost entire exclusion of fish
ing. We think they said that they had
caught three fish. The bright eyes of
the young ladies were the only depths
in which tliey fished. We are afrai.l
that some of thoso fishermen got
caught themselves on silver hooks
without barbs. But, we must not "tell
g > tales out of school."
A FISH FRY.
We found, on our arrival at 11
o'clock A. M., after having left Pine
ville at f»i o'clock of the same mnu
ing, that the ladiesand gentlemen wWe
to have a fis^ fry on the Creek or rath
er at Captain Welsh's Springs near by,
and we proceeded to give, ourselves an
invitation to attend for the purpose of
interviewing the party on the best way
of frying fish anil to test our stowins:
capacity after a drive of twenty-three
miles without breakfast.
We found the ladies all assembled
in the shade at the Spiin^ and tin', the
gentlemen had not if tiii ikiî I 'iic.
tutorial expedition dmvn ti,
They noon came up, limvt'.vr;. with
their fish baskets filled with nice limit
0 »nd perch, mid the frying was com
menced l»y the servants. Meanwhile,
lis one, or pet haps all, of the gentle
men had been bitten by either a snake
or mosquito, we forget which, we pro
dnced a preset iption which our genial
friend Geiger, at the, Dmg Store of Dr.
Henry St. .John had carefully prepared
for us before fitJirtinif, fo filmet j'int
er queer looking prescript inn bottle,
hud been cooled in the Springs, we
proceeded to cure the snake bites in
the approved medical style. We soon
had an ample repast under the super
vision of the ladies who, kindly insist
ed that Dr. St. John and Mr. Seip who
had lost their breakfast fishing, and
ourself should be first served as we
were presumed to be -the hungriest of
the party. We fully proved the wis
dom of this assumption on (lie part of
the ladies, and we know of half a doz
en trout who sport no more in the lim
pid waters of classic Trout Creek, and
whoso usuul biding places know them
no more.
Poor little fishes! Nice little Trout !
They baited a hook, tliey put in the water,
They fooled, they beguiled you out
Aud I'm sure they hadn't ought'er.
A PARTY.
On Friday evening the young folks
met at the Hotel and had a dance, with
its usual promenades etc., until about
eleven when those who had couches re
tired to them and "the boys" who had
only the floor of the old church, pro
ceeded each to select his particular
"soft" plank. As the thermometer
had been as high as 102° during the
day, and the night was proportionate
ly hot, it was even then some time be
fore "balmy sleep, tired nature's sweet
restorer" sought our weary lids.
A POLITICAL MEETING.
On Saturday there was a gathering !
of the clans of the neighborhood at, the!
Springs to hear the political news of I
the day and to consult as to their in- j
s ^.ndX ^fiiZ.°ViS,'x p i
at least a hundred of the good citizens j
ntion to assist in freeing Louisiana'
n :i
limited Captain M. i
of Catahoula not together on so short a 1
notice, speaks well for their interest
in this campaign and if their determin-1
Lovelace, who nominated Captain M.
Welsh, as Chairman. The Captain was
â A ï jsäl aa 1
sues of the day and that his neighbors, j I
na well as the whole people oftlie par
i, » '"V ® confidence in his wisdom and :
that they duly appreciate his , U anv!
sterling qualities. The meeting was
then first talked to bv us upon the in- 1
traduction of the Chairman. We could
only preach orthodox While Man's
Party doctrine, but wo don't know : R
liowit took with the people, as
idea was new fo the most of them.— I
i'uptaiii J. G. White was then intro
uccu u» ti it; uniting at,«] lu* made an j
* KM) (lent «*u<J :i!»!e ]}«
rnr
ried the meeting with him by his earn
est eloquence and telling appeals to
them and if there were any laggards
there. Captain White convinced them
of their duty to work zealously and
faithfully fortlie redemption of Louis
iana from foul wrongs and odious bur
dens, ail of which he portrayed in most
effective terms. He was frequently
applauded and made a most flattering
impression upon the meeting. His
speeeh will do much good in that
neighborhood ami in others when his
ideas will be carried by the people who
were present. The people of Catahou
la may be safely counted on ill the
campaign. ,
THE TIUI* I1ÖME.
Bright and early on the next morn
ing, Captain White and family, Mr. F.
Seip and lady. Dr. II. St. John and
ourself hid adieu to the Springs and
started for home. Having got safely
across Little River it was our intention
to breakfast at Big Creek, but it com
menced to raiu before we got there and
we drove on to the hospitable house of
Mr. Dean on this side. A (ire was soon
Mazing, coffee made, and a most excel
lent lunch and breakfast combined, for
which we were indebted to the fore
thought of the Doctor, was spread.
Seasoned with the Doctor's witticisms
and a ravenous appetite, our breakfast,
even in the face of the rain, was all
that could bo desired. "A feast of
reason, and a flow of soul" prevailed
throughout and we count that as a
bright spot in our pleasant memories.
Clear Creek and Flaggon quickly pass
ed, a short halt at Lewis' Spring, witii
a peep at the yellow jackets whose
stings occasioned another resort to the
prescription bottle, a friendly exchange
of regrets at the near approach of our
pleasant journey's end, the red hill, the
ferry boat and our trip to the Springs
and back was over. We were never
more kindly treated, more pleasantly
entertained ami made to eujov our
selves more than on the trip. We de
sire to express our thanks for the uni
form kinducss shown us by the eutire
party.

Dkak Sins—Your correspondent in your

twaddle about "Mr. T.," and his scrap

point at, issue, and which my previous
communication was designed to show, and
did plainly show, viz : that a certain po
em published iu the Democrat a few weeks
since, with his name attached to it as the
author, was written by somebody else
years ago. The nearest he approached the
subject, in point, was that the writer of
t!i is ' bad discovered a slight resemblance
between a poem published fifteen years

You garbled it and "gobbled" it. Had
your few verbal changes not, injured the
original any, it would not have been so
bad, but where those changes occur the
beauty is marred and the sense seriously
impaired. Yon infer that "T.," is some
what, taciturn, etc. Perhaps so, but you'll

That Regret
of
The Editor of-the Democrat says
that he attended the Democratic
Mass Meeting "as a listener and re
porter," (something more than
he did for the people's Mast» Meet
ing on the 8th inst,) and " regrets
to state that the meeting of Inst
Saturday was "thinly, beggardly
attended, only some eight persons
participating therein." We would
not have noticed this article of the
Democrat but for its singular course
in refusing to publish in full the
proceedings of the Mass Meeting
the White Man's Party. But the
course of that Journal is rather sin
gular aud inconsistent, and it
clearly perceptible that he has
"soured" on some thing or some
body. The Democrat «for the last
month has been wagfng incessant
warfare against the action of the
Democratic Central Committee, and
joined in the call for a Mass Meet
ing on the 8th inst. As every one
knows that the Mass Meeting which
adopted the White Man's Party
was the largest, most enthusiastic
and harmonious that has assembled
iu this Parish since the war, it is
strange indeed that the Democrat
should regret that the Democratic
meeting which was iu opposition to
the White Man's Party, should be
so thinly attended. From this re
gret , we can infer only, that the ed
itor of that Journal, is desirous of
seeing greater discord in the ranks
of the white people of Rapides, the
effect of which would be to retain iu
power the present set of vampires,
and give the parish and State over
to the negroes. Now iu charity to
the Democrat we will say, that we
do not believe that this is its de
sire; and our'regrets are that it
does not properly appreciate the
voice of the people with whom it
has so long lived, and march bold
ly up to the front, giving battle to
the eueiny, under the banner and
name, that has been adopted. The
white people wish no equivocal or
doubtful status, in a contest that is
for the preservation of their civili
zatiôn, their property and the su
premacy of their race. Have no
more regrets but let us be rejoiced
that such unanimity exists, in our
ranks, as portends defeat to the en
cmies ot our prosperity.

An Insinuation .—"Any blind
than can pierce the thin veil, and
everybody here understands it."
Kxactly ! Everybody understands
that the Democrat advocates the
liail Road, because it has no trou
ble in writing its articles, and it
pays ; aud everybody kuows be
sides, that they are written by the
Attorney of the road, who is paid
his legitimate and well earned fee
for so doing. Nobody objects to
either tor so doing, but then, you
know Democrat , that it all sounds
like special pleading on one side,
rather than a fair argument of
both sides.
But this was not what the words
quoted above even intended to in
sinuate. It was, that because one
of our Editors is in his individual
capacity, lessee of tho Bayou Ro
bert 1'lauk Road, he influences the
Caucasian in opposition to the Rail
Road. The Editor of the Democrat
who once held the same positioh is
welcome to think so if he wants to,
welcome to think so if he wants to,
but for the benefit of others, it may
be well to stato that the three Edi
tors of this paper are in perfect ae
cord on this Rail Road question,
and Plank Road or not, happen
to be on the side of the people, and
that is just what hurts the " cliron
grumbler" of the Democrat

river in a miserable boating condition,
just as we expected and we will "jnst

in one week of twenty-one inches will
give us eight inches for boating busi

The Directors of the Association in conséquence of the impoverished condition of
our people and tho general stringency of the times, find themselves unable to obtain
from the ordinary methods of raising funds—means sufficient and necessary to place
tins institution upon a solid and permanent basis—one that will enable thein to
increase its sphere of' usefulness and attractiveness to all classes of the public
To accomplish the following desirable ends: 1st. The extinguishment of all debts
which may now be due by the Association. 2nd. The erection of suitable buildings
for the Mechanical and Agncultnaal products exhibited, and for the protection of
stock—the Directors have adopted the foregoing plan, which seems to tliern the only
tcasibleand practical wayof raising the necessary funds. In proposing this scheme the
Directors do not disguise from themselves the difficulties which must attend its
execution; but reposing their confidence iu the worthiness of their aims, they ap
peal to the sympathy and pride of the citizens, especial! vof this and our sister par
ishes, and to every public spirited Lonisianian, to come forward and aid an enter
prise, which seeks only to build up and develop the resources of our beloved State.
1 he object of the Association is to create a renewed interest among all classes of
our citizens m our coming Fair, and at the same time, by offering large inducements
to stimulate the sale of its tickets to an extent that will enable it to realize an
amount adequate to its pressing wants. The plan of The Association is to issue 20 -
000 tickets at seventy-live cents a ticket-the price of admission to the Fair with a
coupon attached bearing a number: the said ticket entitling the holder to one ad
mission to the rair, the coupon being retained by himself.
Ou the last day of the Fair, numbers corresponding with the number of ticket*
issued, will be placed in a wheel, and all of the prizes in another, when the GrauU
Drawing will take place under tho supervision of tho folluwiug well-kuowu t «u.
