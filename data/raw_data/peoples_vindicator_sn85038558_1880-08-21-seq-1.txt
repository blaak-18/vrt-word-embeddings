People who go around growling
about the heat. don't know when
they are well off. It is a very rare
thing that we have the temperature
obore 100 degrees. A French as
tronomer has recently discovered
that the temperature in the sun is
90.000 degree above zero. Just pon
der on those figures for a moment.
Of course being in the sun the ther
mometer's state in the shade cannot
be given. The thermometer couldn't
be tl the sun and in the shade at
the same time. What must the price
of palm leaf fans be in the center of
our solar system. Ice cream there

town, says to Smith: "Is this hot

ihWho tube for the last half hour has
just slid down and says Its only 16,
640 now." Probably when the ther
mometer gets down to about 14,000,
people begin looking up their furs
and flannels there. The sun shines
for all, including its own inhabitants.
An Episode.
A sombre-faced man, with long
hair like a corn doctor or a poet. en
tered the post office one day last
week and laid down a nickel, and in
quired for two three-cents stamps.
ile was Informed that six cents was
necestry for the purchase.
"This Is the economy of the coun
try Is It? ? In the country where I I
came from I always get two stamps
for five cents. Is this the only post c
office in town ?
"It is."
"Ab, ha. That accounts for it.
Oompetltion la whatgives life to all
business. If you only had two or
three post offices here stamps would
go down to twenty cents a dozen Into
no time. It's a wonder some enter
prising aespitalist don't go nlato the
poet ofiee business here, and brinlg
prices down where the ought to be."
Then shblng an old-lufashioned cop
per out of his poocket, sad laying t it in
the delivery window, he adhered hisl
stamps to a yellow envelope, and
ranibhed like a beautiful dream.

"MI'otber, has anvthing happlned ?"
"Nothing but, what we expected,"

"AAnd tthi is Woeitanedeay." she eBali ;
"it is too bad ! I just hate that Mr.
Arle! Wh, does he, with all his
wealth, want to take away out. little
farm ' Olh, dear! Can't anything
be done i?"
Mrs. Derwent only sobbed in an
swer, but Hannah looked keenly at
her young s ster, as she said mean
inglv:
"You are the one who can best
answer that question, Katie."
Katie's face turned crimson, and
then grew very pale.
"Oh, Hannah," she said, mploring
ly, "don't ask me to do that, for I
cannot; no, I never can !"
"You would rather see us turned
out of home than maker small sac
rifice, than ?"
"A small sacrifice, Hannah'? To
melt seems very large."
"Heaven only knows what we are
to do!" walled Mrs. Derwent. "We
haven't fiftry dollars in the world !"
"Oan't we borrow enough money
from Squire Davis to pay off this
mortgage" asked Katie, desperately,
"You must think Squire Davis has
no sense," said Hannah. sharply.
"He would know well enough there
was no chance of our ever paying
him back. We manage to make just
enough off the farm to live, and that's
all."
"To think that I should have to go
to the almshouse nla my old age !
moaned Mrs. Derwent.
"Oh, mother!" surely not quite so
bad as that ?" said Katie.
"Perhaps you will kindly suggest
some plan," said Hannah, sareastlel
ly. "I know of but one way In which
we can keep our home, and that does
not appear to suit you."
"I'll have to think it ove',"sald
Katie, "and while I am thinking, I
will catch that gray rooster you want
for dinner, Hannah."
"Very well; but Paul can't help
you, for I've sent him on an errand.
And I hope you'll think to some pur
pose, Katie."
Hannah began to wash up the
breakfast dishes as she spoke know
lng that her sister understood very
well what she meant by her last re
marks, for Katie sighed heavily as
she put on her straw hat and went
out to the farmyard in search of the
gray cock, which she found scratch.
ing in some straw, utterly unooncious
of his impending doom.
But at the first flutter of her apron,
which she tried to throw over him,
he fled, closely pursued by the young
girl, whose seventeen summers had
not given her dignity, or taken from
her a childish love of racing and
climbing.
But running proved hard work in 1
the hot August sun, and, out of
breath at last, Katie stopped in the f
clover-field, the frightened fowl still
a safe distance off.
In -Squire Davis' great meadow I
she could see the busy laborers load
ing the immense wagons with new
mown hay, and just beyond the stone I
wall which divided his farm from the
Widow Derwent's, lay one of the f
men under the shade of the' spread
ing oak-tree, his hat pulled over his
eyes, and his rake lying on the green
grass besiae him.
A sudden Inspiration eized Katie,.
who, putting her foot on the juttling
stone of the wall, sprang ihtly to
the top. ,
"Man?" she called loudly-"oh, 1
man ! will you please help me catch
my rooster ?' I know Squire Davi I
won't mind if you do."
Tae man thus asingularly addressed
satup suddenly, his straw hat falling
from his head, and thereby reviallng
a wealth of curly chestnut hair. BHis
elothes were rough and Ill-itinog, it
is true, but his face a refined and
handsome one, and his bearing far
above that of the average hired man.
"I will help you in any way I can." I
he said, after a quick lanee at the
flushed, pretty face of te girl on the
stonewall, " Did yaou y you want
ed me to help you catch a rooster !"
hesltating just a little.
"Yes, may sister wants him for din
ner, and I've run until I'm tired out.
Do yon suppose the squire will sold
if you spend a little while helping
me ?"
"Why should he?" in a toneof sur
"Well, he's very strict, and hisl
hired men have to work hard, i've
heard. I gues he don't know of
your testing under this tree, and I'm
afrand be will hear of it from the
other men, and pay you your wages
and turn you ofm."
"Oh, I see," said the young man,
with a smile.
"It is true; you don't know him as
well as I do. I guess you harvn't
been working for him long."
"Only this morning."
"You look smart enough to make
something better of youmrself than a
hired man jin a hayfeld.," pursued
Katie. "Buntof course that is your
own afatir. Don't let us waste any
more time talking; that rooster is
getttng all his strength back." _
The young man sprang lightly
over the stonewall, and again the
obase began the poor towl sueoumb

Iof hard running.
"And now you had better hurry

The chicken dinner was much en
joi e, by little Paul, the only one of
Cho family who did not feel troubled
at the Impending removal from the
old homt, and he, poor child! was
tuoo young to know what sorrow
rIeaxt.
Hannah looked stern and forbid
ding. Mrs. Derwent's eyes were red,
and there were traces of tears on
KaTre's cheeks, for she had not es
,'aped a scolding from Hannah, for
unnecessary delay in the catching of
the fowl.
When dinner wasover, and she had
helped her sslater tidy the kitchen,
Katie took a tin pall from the pan
try and her hat from Its peg, and
started out.
"*Where are you going asked Han
nah sharply.
"To the stone wall in the pasture
to pick blackberries," answered
Katie. "I saw some nice ones up
there this morning when I was chas
Ing the rooster, and I thought mother
would like some for super.
"Very well." said Hannah: "but
don't stay the whole afternoon, for
you've all these dish-towels to hem,
though there's no telling if we'll use
'em, since we'll be in a poorhouse
after Monday.
The afternoon sun shone full
on the blackberry bushes and
Katie found picking the ripe fruit no
cool task; but she preferred it to sit
ting in the house with Hannah, Ilst
ening to bitter reproaches for her
refusal to take the stop which could
prevent the old home from passing
into the hands of Mr. Arle.
"Why should I have nothing, and
Squire Davis all the good thigR ?"
she said, aloud. "Even the shade is
on his side of use wallt"
She was interrupted in her rebel
lious reflections by the sudden ap
pearance of Hannah, almost out of
breath from running.
"Katie," she said, "come home at
once, Squire Davis is waiting to sen
you."
"Oh, Hannah, I can't go! I don't
want to see him!"
"Katie Derwent, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself," cried Hannah,
loudly. "Squire Davis is rich, a
member of tue church, and a man
any woman might be glad to marry."
"But he is so old, Hanna, and I am
only seventeen."
"Pehaw! what does that matter?
You will see us thrown on the charl.
ty of our friends, robbed of our hoime
and its comforts, rather than make a
trifling sacrifice. You can't have
much love for your poor, sick moth
er or little brother. Squire Davis
would pay off the mortgage at once
if you would only promise to marry
him. Come. Katie, don't be so stub
born."
"I'm not stubborn, Hannah. I
would do almost anything for mother
and Paul, but, oh! let me have a lit
tie more time. I will thing of it-I
will indeed. Tell the squire to come
to-morrow, and I'll give him my an
swer."
"Do YOU suppose he will submit to
such treatment ?" demanded Han
nah. "Told to come and go at your
fancy! You promised lastsunday to
give him an abswer to-day."
"But I can't, Hannah; no, I can't
to.day. You can tell him anything
you like, but I won't see him to
day."
"Then i'll tell him I couldn't find
you," said the wily Hannah. "It I
should tell him youea had refused to
come he would suapect somethling."
Katie waited until her sister's
gaunt figure had disappeared over
the rising ground, and trea, throw
ing hereMlf down by the blackberry
bushes, burst into tears.
"I suppose I must do it," she
moaned.
"'No you mustn't," said a very
sympathetic volce, and lookting up
Katle espied, to her astonishment,
her acquaintance of the mornlng,
sitting above her on the stone wall,
He was handsornely dressed now in
a sualt of gray tweed, and looked un
idenably a gentleman.
"Were you listeniang?" she de
manded, sitting up, the tears still
Ilngering on her Long, courling eye
S"Yee. I was," was the frank reply.
You see, I grow tired of work, so I
left the equirq's employ, put on m
Suuday clothes and strolled out. I
was lying down La the shade of the
wall, dozing, and had just become
aware of your presence on the other
side when your sister eame. Of
course I could not then declare my
proximIrty without embarraesrlng you
botth., so 1 waited."
"You don't seem to think you are
embarras3ing me now," said Katie,
woondering why bhi black eyes spar
kled so ,mlele vously.
"Am I ?" very cooly. "Well. I
am sorry. Still you don't look very
much overcome with confusion."
"Appearances are deceitful some
times." said lale, risLing to her feet.
"True; you will have cause to re
member that later. Now. take a lit
tie advice in return for that you gave
me this morning, Don't let your
sister persuade you to marry the
squire. You are far too young to
take the puiltlon of stepmother to
his ble chldrefn.
"But if I dtm't marry him we can't
keep the farm. No one else will lend
us the mnem'y to pay offthe mortgage,
Oh, hlw I hatr that nr. Arle!"
The yo3uCng man saileul.
S"ou.oethillg tells me that all will
come out right ih the end," he said,
"Walt a little while and see it I am
not correct in my prophecy."
"You are very ktnd, I'm sure to
taks such interest 'in me' maid kin
tie. "I thank you very mueh; and
now goodbe-_I feel too badly to
stay out in this hot sun any longer,"
and picking up her pall of betries
she waqted away, the younag man
watching her until she was lost to
eIght over the rising ground otolover
Katle's hea1t flt :lightew, though
abshe could scarcely tell why, and ne
crept up the backtail~.oto erown
room unnoticed by Ilannah,, and
bathed her red eye. Thea, feeling
much refreshed, silbhrew heself on
her bed and was 0oon solee wp, m ,
pletely worn out-ty the exitmpat
of the day.
"*he wa.,eabined Yby stislbui -

sofs in easy conversation with 0aer
mother, the young man whom she
had left two hours previously by the
stone wall in the clover:-leld.
"Katle, this is Mr. Arle," said Mrs.
Derwent; "and he has been so kind
as to offer to let us keep the tfarm at
a small rent. Comeand thank hle."
But Katie did not stir in obedience
to her mother's command. She gas
ed at Mr. Arie a moment as It petri
fled with amazement, and thea turn.
lag, fled, slamming the door behind
her.
"Forgive her rudeness, Mr. Arle,"
murmured the proper Hannah. "She
is only a child, and does not know
how to behave."
George Arle smiled, but said noth
ing, understandlng better than Han
nash Katie's strange conduct.
Katie was standing under the ap
ple tree by the gate in the front gar
den when George Arle cane out of
the house and she waited for him.
"Forgive me," she said, as he came
close to her. "I did not know. I
thought you were really-"
"The squire's hired man," he ion
terrupted. "You see that, as you
said, appearance are deceitful some
times. I borrowed that old suit from
Bob Davis, and I went to the bay
field for a frolic; but I found it less
fun to toss bay than I had antleipa
ted, so I went under that: old tree to
lie down. I came yesterday to the
squire's to spend a few days with
"What must you have thought of
me ?" Katie faltered. "I gave you
advioe and samid-"
"That you hated Mr. Arle. Oh, I
don't bear you any grudge. I am
very glad you did not know to whom
you were speaking, for, had y
tnown I should not pi,abl h'ave
learned what my agent was about. I
did not even know that the mortmgge
was due; or, if he told me of it d
forgotten It. But I is all right now,
and there is no reason Whatever that
you should marry the iquire," with
merry laugh.
Then he went away, and left Katie,
with a radlent fae and a very light
heart, standing by the gate.
When the squire came the nest day
for his answer, he received it from
Katie herself, and it was very deci
dedly In the negative.
Disappointed and chagrlned, the
elderly lover went home to pour the
story of his sorrows into the ears of
hib iguest, George Arle, who sincere
ly advised him to transfer his affeo
tions from the childish Katie to the
practical Hannah, who was in every
way fitted to rule his house with
judgment and economy.
The squire's thoughts were driven
Into a new channel, and be was not
slow to see the soundness of the ad
vice offered him. -
The result was that three months
had scarcely elapsed before Hannah
was lnstalled mistres of the'Davis
1household, she batng noseruples on
the score of her admirer's advaneod
Yrears,.,
The three months had not *otved
uneventful to Ktle who rebealved
calls from G tl- Ai whenever he
could spare a day from his business
in the city. tanding totherone
evenalng n late October under the old
apple tree by the gate, the young
man suddenly took In his both the
small brown hands of his blushing
comn ion.
."K ," he said, trying to look

sistently aveed, "tell me, dearest,

There was no answer, and George
raised with one hand the dimpl
ohita until hecould at last see ioto
the shy blue eyes. What answer to
this question he read there, he could
beettell; butlitmust have been the

uncontrollable desire to do what we
see others do, and the other an Irre
sletable wish to see what others see.
History reeords many lnstones of
these manias.

first occurred in AIx-le-Oapelle and
other oitles in 137t, when an asem
blage of personb appeamed who had
"danceed their way through Germa*

that there were 30,000 persons thus
engaged.
Its ommiencement was suposed
to have been that a single Individual,.

mania, to actas others act, Jolied In
