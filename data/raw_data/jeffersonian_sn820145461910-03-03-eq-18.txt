In the Government’s suit to dissolve ,the
merger of the Union and Southern Pacific
Railroads, rather an amusing bit of testi
mony was brought out.
One of the road’s officials testified that the
Union Pacific used trained goats for unload
ing live stock at night. It seems that a sheep
is afraid to leave the car in which it is loaded
after dark, but can be persuaded to do so if
led by a goat. The railroad officials, know
ing the sheep’s fear of the dark, keep a drove
of trained goats to unload the sheep shipped
to Omaha over the Union Pacific.
Many’s the time that a small corporation
official has been made the “goat” of a prose
cution by getting the prison sentence which
rightly belonged to the man higher up, but
this is the first news of a goat doing the real
work of a brakeman.

It’s something new and cheap. It
catches at all seasons—something no
other tackle will do. It will tickle you

voted for Weaver the first time on a

for Gen. Butler, four years later for
A. J. Streeter, of Illinois.
Still four years later for Weaver

I went to the war as soon as I was old
enough to keep from being conscript
ed early in 1862, served under
Wheeler as a cavalryman until I was
taken a prisoner, near Murfreesboro,
Tenn.
My colonel, major, second lieuten
ant, and a host of privates and cap
tains and lieutenants of other compa
nies, about 1,200, in all, were sta
tioned for two days in a part of Ro
sencrant’s infantry at Murfreesboro,
where I heard both sides of the war
question discussed between our side
and the Yankee officers. There I
made up my mind that I would never
shoot another gun for Jeff Davis or
secession.
I was moved from there to Camp
Chaos, in Ohio, for a while, from
there to Fort Delaware, thence to
Point Lookout, in Maryland.
In March, 1863, I was parolled as
a prisoner, sent across to Richmond,
Va. From there I worked my way
home to Blount county, in North Ala
bama, a mere skeleton, where I found
my widowed mother, four brothers
and three sisters; I was the oldest of
the children. I remained at home
with them till the close of the war.
Then Abraham Lincoln was assassi
nated, and Johnson took his place,
called on the Southern Governors to
call the Legislature together, who
had been serving during the war, to
frame a Constitution that would not
conflict with the Constitution of the
United States. They made one, but
the United States did not accept it,
but passed a State law imposing a
$3.50 poll-tax on both white and
black from 21 to 45 years of age.

The next Legislature was Republi

the Confederacy, or secession, of the
Lost Cause, the better I will like it.

Jeffersonian
You have often heard the statement that
the way to reach a man’s heart was through
his stomach or through his pocketbook.
For goodness sake, let’s hope it is true. If
the Trusts are not reaching the heart of the
common people by both routes with our pres
ent tariff, please tell us why.
You can hammer tariff at the people from
one year to another. You can show how they
are being robbed in the clothing, the shoes
and hats they wear, the material with which
they have to build their homes and the tools
with which they work, but about the greatest
interest you arouse is a tired grunt.
But now that the outrageous price they are
paying for what they are eating is beginning
to "make that gnawing feeling in the stomach
there may be some hope of showing them
what their tariff is doing.
If this turns out to be the case, then the
unlimited greed of the Beef Trust will have
done an unintended good,—made the people
open their eyes enough to see what is really
going on in this country.
ties of the United States. She can
throw a million or more votes to this
side or that, as she wills, to her own
advantage. Thus she virtually con
trols the result of our Presidential
elections, and this gives her unlimit
ed power with the politicians, who
will go to any length to gain her
favor.
In 1912 she expects to name one
or both of the Presidential candi
dates, and dictate as to the member
ship of the Cabinet of the new Presi
dent.
Will you help us to counteract her
influence in politics? This can be
done with an organization of one or
two million Protestants. The ques
tion whether you are Democrat, Pro
hibitionist, Republican, or Socialist,
will not be asked.
We simply ask for AMERICAN
PROTESTANTS.
As a clergyman you can help us
wonderfully. We have already in
our membership many well-known
clergymen who are Baptists, Congre
gationalists, Episcopalians, Disciples,
Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyte
rians, etc., but we desire at least
twenty thousand ministers, and then
victory will be assured, for this will
mean a million or two million or
more laymen..
There is no charge to clergymen
for membership, and literature on all
phases of the papal question will be
sent free of charge.
We are also forming a “Literature
and Lecture Board” to reach foreign
immigrants. Protestant clergymen
who preach in French, German, Por
tugues, Spanish, Italian, Swedish,
and other languages, have volunteer
ed to help us.
We have the greatest Christian
charity for Roman Catholics as indi

“Democrats With Stupidity Becloud Their Rare
Chance.
“If They Had Gone Out to Seek Deliberately a
Mode for Party Suicide, They Couldn’t Have
Chosen Two More Effective Mistakes Than to An

Holy Moses, save us; what has happened to
the Hon. John Temple since he pulled up
stakes and left Atlanta?
The Democrats seek party suicide by op
posing new battleships and a Merchant Ma

If the Democratic party could show such a
suicidal record all the way down the line, the
next Congress would be so overwhelmingly
Democratic and the next Democratic candi
date for President would be elected by such
a big majority that the Republican party
would be put out of business for years to

We must not take Mr. Graves too seriously,
though, for he hasn’t been a very good weath

hasn’t improved one bit.
