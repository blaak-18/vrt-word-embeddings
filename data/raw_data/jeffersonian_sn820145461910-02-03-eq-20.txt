HOLY HERB
The Yerba Santa, as the old
Mission Fathers of the West
named the “Holy Herb” of the In
dians, is hard to gather in its
mountain heme, and has, there
fore, never been placed on the
market as a drug. Made into a
hot tea, it is palatable, and yet a
most marvelous remedy for colds,
coughs, fever, and even pneumo
nia. It warms quicker than whis
ky, and is absolutely harmless. So
destructive is it to the microbes of
disease that the Spanish mission
aries, seeing the wonderful cure
wrought by the Indian herb,
named it “Holy”.
If you have a cough, cold, fever,
trouble with your stomach or in
testines, send me a silver dime, or
ten cents in stamps, and I will
mail you a sample of the “Holy
Herb”. It can not hurt you, and,
if you follow the simple directions,
it will cure you.

Thomas Watson and Foreign Missions
Tom Watson is “in it,” up to his
neck.
Thomas’ views on subjects and
things are apt at times to be radical
and rabid.
He has a knock-down and drag-out
style of argument which isn’t pleas
ing to those opposed to him.
And Thomas has tackled “Foreign
Missions” with so much bitterness
that he has a formidable challenge
thrown at him, suggesting a joint de
bate as the only way to settle forever
the views Mr. Watson holds.
The joint debate is to be based on:
“Resolved, That the Foreign Mis
sions as at present conducted by the
Christian churches is unwise, un
necessary and fruitless.”
Mr. Watson will doubtless gasp
when he gets that challenge, for the
wording is so beyond the sentiment
expressed by him.
There are a great many people,
not so fearless nor so irascible as
Mr. Watson, who hold strong views
on the question of Foreign Missions.
With all due respect for those who
conduct them, for the many noble
men and women who are interested
in them, there are some of us who
honestly think that “Foreign Mis
sions” and charity are made to do
duty for a multitude of things whose
names are different.
In overlooking the duties which
lie closest, it isn’t always neglect on
the part of those so doing, it is often
ignorance of the condition nearest.
And a great deal of meddling and
rather overbearing actions have been
known to be done under the head of
“mission work.”
Almost daily, every newspaper in
the State of Georgia is in receipt of
pleas for publication of the needs of
the orphanages and schools for poor
children in the State.
It has been proven by all sorts of
statistics that, as a State, Georgia
ranks among the wealthiest, but
gives the least to the cause of edu
cation; it must also be true that her
parsimonious tactics extend to her
charities, else we would not be so
beseiged with pleas for aid.
Mr. Thomas Watson may be per
fectly rational in his attitude toward
Foreign Mission work, he may have
noted the attitude of people toward
home mission work and realized that
“the poor whom we have always with
us” lose out when it comes to a ques
tion of aid.
“The sails of all ships look white
in the distance” is an old Italian
proverb; stripped of its verbiage it
means a far view of anything makes
it less distinct and therefore of more
interest.
Some how, a missioner preaching
for money for Kwang Sue Ling and
Wo Ching Fung, finds it easier to
get money for their needs than when
asking for money to send Jimmy
Brown and Jennie Smith to school
in decent clothes and with the neces
sary books.
Foreign Missions are excellent
things, but—has it occurred to many
that China, Japan, and India are
vastly richer than the United States?
That the percentage of Christian
ized and enlightened people is large
enough to Christianize and enlighten
the rest of their countries?
And, also; no one insists on do-
TJaffersonlan
Ing for themselves what they can get
others to do for them.
And again: in the mountains of
Tennessee and Kentucky, there are
white men, women and children
whose unbroken lives of ancestry go
back to before the days of the Ameri
can Revolution, but who know of
God only as an unknown quantity,
who have never seen a printed paper
to know its contents; who have no
conception of what civilization or en
lightenment is beyond “thou shalt
not kill” and “thou shalt not steal.”
Is it with these people in mind
that Mr. Watson speaks?
If it is, then there are many of us
with him in sentiment.—The Bruns
wick Journal, edited by Alice Louise
Lytle.
General Lee —A Great American
In a letter to the Chicago Record-
Herald, Lieutenant-Colonel Watrous
deprecates the efforts now being
made in Michigan and Illinois to
have the statue of General Robert E.
Lee excluded from the Hall of Fame
at Washington.
We think that few citizens can
have heard of these efforts or can
have read the resolutions resulting
from them without disagreeing with
their object and without regretting
the temper they show.
General Lee was an American. He
was one of the very greatest of
Americans. He was a lovable, Chris
tian man—a man whom future gen
erations of Americans will never
cease to hold proudly in regard.
Virginians wish his statue along
with that of General Washington in
the space allotted to their State in

could not be jointly honored. This,
we believe, is the real sentiment of
the North —a sentiment that, on the
test, would show itself by an over
whelming majority of voices.
