"Josiah Allen's wife's receipt book."
R. L. Turner writes to the Solthern
C'aidtivtor as follows;
Supposing that tile sweet potatoes
of the previous crops are i iinilips
i. e. put up in conical shape or cov
ered with straw or corn stalks, and
then earth, and then hoarded over, I
commence in March by taking oilff my
board cover from my seed pump andi
let in rain on it. In April, my pota
toes being sprouted, I mark out the
size I want lay seed bedl, ani have it
dug out in spade deep; tihen fill it
loosely with reen cotton seed ; then
get in on a and tramp down the
seed. 'rhey wit! tramp down nearly
one-4talf. Then pIt in four inches of
earth ; then lay your sweet potatoes,
touehibg each other, all over the
earth; then cover one and a half
inchei with earth.
It there is a rainy spell, all right;
but if not, water this seed bed thor
onglly twice a week. By the first of
May your bed will have thousands of
plantsoto it.
Noev for the potato patch, as we
call it. Plough your intended potato
patch two or three times before set
ting out drawers, having it in rows.
Plaghk and reverse, getting the soil
in flue tilthl. When the time is near
for setting out, tank a single shovel
plough, open your beds to the depth
of three inches, put a little pure sta
ble cltfure in the trench, and await
the Tral. If the rain does not come
set oat with Hater-lhalf a pint to
each hill--the earth being pressed
firmly around the potato root, andt a
little dry earth sprinkled around the
top ground. Next is the setting out
-somle say one foot, solim say two
feet apart--I ray four inches.
Then the cultivation-is to plough
to your potatoes all the time, pulling
the earth up around the little plaits
with the hoe the first working.. ever
bar off, thereby saving the siuall roots
which make potatoes, and saving one
half the ploughiing.
In t8f6, I nlmdle 150 bushels sweet
potatoes on one-half acre of hInd Iby
this mode-giving onie lhoeing, or p1,11
ling up witil a hoe, and two plough
lugs, o the potatoes.
American Cookery.
The impotanee of good cooking as
a mean. of health and halppitess is
vet, much utlerrated by many
housekeepers, especially those of
America. ThIere must always be
enough to eat, bat the quality is con
sidered of mlauch less eonsaequence;
provided it he whltlesmne ntld not too
much trowble to Iprelare, the ordlina
ry American minid is folly satisfied.
Thel taste of the thrifty housekeeper
runs nmnch tiore to a file disllhy of
table-linen, silver, and glass-things
which delighlt the eye, but can never
satisfy a hungry man, nor promote
friendship and good humor. At how
imany tables, even of rich Americals,
may we find this gorgeous array ot'
table frnitnre, and view the elegaunt
uhina Illed with food at whichli aiy
ordinary Frenlch laborer would tlurn
up his nose ! Among people of mod
erate means thle erroneous Illea Ire
vtails that delicate liviig is extrava
gLnt and out of the reach of ordina
ry mortals, who eat their greasy beef
sad watery potatoes with tle coln.
fortlttg reflection tlhat thereby
they are practising the great virtue
of economy. This in a terrible ttis.
take. Those same people are daily
waisting material enough to en;able
agy French peasant woman to preo
pare a delieate and palatable repast.
Fgonomy in the kitchlen is of course
iipbseible where matters aire left in
charge of some ignorant cauk who
easnot and would not if she could,
pay the least attention to the saving
and proper use of all the bits and
ends which under her sway find their
way to the soanp-fat man and tile
swill-tab. Waste appears to be the
grand watclh-tword of the ordinary
American or English kitchen, and it
in all thle more piteous to behold whlen
we conidcer the saving and thrifty
character oh these very Ipeple. This
waste, then, i purely the result of
ignorance and itntteution to what is
really one of the great questions of
social life. On this acount every
new book bringing forward now filcts
and new ideas in regard to this all
importat ealtject should be warmly
welcoomed and faithfully studied by
every American weonu . "'lrolt in
nate eoquetry alone," says Mrs. lieo
dlereen, "the Frenclth women appre
iate the powers of their dainty ta
ible. Cooking is an art thley cultivate.
Any of the Meau meols aro proud to
origiaste a new dish, many fatlous
ones doing them credit in tCearing
their namuls." Until this is true of
American women as well, the Ameri
can eaiae can scarcely be ezpseted
to rile above its present mediocrity,
for, alas I Mrs. Heudersou's remark is
too true, that "American wiomen seem
lpoeaeed with thie idea that it isn not
the fhakioa to known how to coik ;
that as m a ccomplishment, the art
.onsee&Ing is not.as ornarnmertal as
that of needle-woik or piano play

For the principles by which Tile World
will be governed in its discussionard
treatment of the lpublie questions, it will
suttice to say that The World, while toe
servative in politics, desires the consert
tion only of what is good and wiseino
public institions and no limitations apec
the right, of peivate ,jndgment andth
aspirat ions of Reform, save those wbih
are imposed by prudenee decorum, a
i fational respect for vested rightsal
for the holiest opinions of all classeslrt
sects of men. While it has laboredfr
the principles and hails the triumphd
the )emocratic party as affording as
practical promise of Reform in our pnui
admimiwtlrations, city, state and natiaonl,
it will not be blindly devoted to tlhe
vancrement of any party or any cliqu4
It will freely canvass the pnublic condd
while it will treat with respect theFp1
vate rights, of Public Men, and it tills
amino fe'arlessy into the workingaeofo"
national, state and municipal geVa"
ments.
It will inculcate a steadfast eliaB0
upon the original principlesof oatper
tical system as the oely sround basis ofl
needed inllporveutect theiu: a~u .:ft
ering devotion to the Constitntiolld
the Union, a scrupulons fidelity to.k
pirit-as well asn the letier ofoarlsr4
and a sleepless vigilance in uniautaian1
all the great safegurads of Civila
Religions Liberty. It will seek toat
igate and not to aggravate the evils ia
separablelO rom Plarty Governmenties
Free Country'; to promote good all1dO
ill tieling among our fellow-citreneorll
creeds and colors, all sections andal
sects; and to advance both by its pie
e'pts and by its exampli the trOn
Rcason and of Law over prejndiae

the dliselnsicrn of all public affairs.
It will do justice always. to the ied

Nor will it lose sight nmeanwhile of tl
