THE FARCE AT WASHINGTON.
The trend of affairs on the alleged
tariff revision in progress at Wash
ington promises to develop into a
farce. An extra session of Congress
was called for the specific purpose of
revising the tariff and the President’s
message, famous for its brevity,
stated in plain terms that tariff re
vision was the only thing to be con
sidered and urged the utmost speed
in passing a new tariff bill. Instead
of doing what it was called in ses
sion to do the leaders in Congress
seem determined to prevent any re
vision. Not only will they hold to
the Dingley schedules, but in some
instances they have raised them. To
show the absurdity of this, it is only
necessary to put the matter in this
form: “Congress called into extra
ordinary session to maintain the
Dingley tariff and if possible raise a
rate here and there.”
What a mockery to the demand for
revision! Most of the Republican
press that supported the administra
tion, and especially those throughout
the West, have been for weeks de
nouncing the House bill and the Al
drich program. The St. Paul Pioneer
Press calls it “the outrageous ef
frontery and chicancery of the Aid
rich and Payne bills.” The Press fur
ther serves notice on the Aldrich wing
in this fashion: “The West is sick of
the domination of Cannon and Al
drich. * * * It would take very
little leadership, if able and sincere,
to detach the entire West from the
Republican party. * * * The West
is not Republican for the sake of the
label. The Republican party has no
mortgage on this section.” This is
straight from the shoulder talk, and
coming from a journal that has never
failed to support the Republican par
ty and protection, is most encourag
ing. While the outcome of the pres
ent revision session promises to be a
disappointment to such party organs,
it is not surprising to the impartial
observer. The absolute control of
the dominant wing of the Republican
party by the protected industries,
whenever the tariff is under consid
eration, has always been recognized
and never more clearly than at this
time. Senator Dolliver aroused the
ire of the member from Rhode Island
by saying the protected industries in
a certain line wrote that schedule of
the tariff. He might have gone
further and stated that every protec
tive tariff schedule for the past forty
years has been dictated by its bene
ficiaries. Those most familiar with
our methods of tariff legislation can
see no hope of its ever being other
wise. There is one chance for the
elerflent of the party that is honestly
striving to carry out the promises of
A Weekly Paper Edited by THOS. E. WATSON and J. D. WATSON
the platform for revision, and that is
the President, but Judge Taft is say
ing nothing. It looks as though he
would have an opportunity to show
his grit before this session is ended.
One thing is certain, the country is
well aroused on this question and is
determined to have relief from ex
cessive ’ tariff duties. If the party
now in power is unable to accomplish
this, some other party will be found
to execute the popular demand. —

“WHY WIRZ?”
To the Editor of the World:
I have been waiting for some one
to inform the World why the South
fSawaBMI 7Js nr ri j
erects a monument to Henry Wirz.
Capt. Wirz suffered martyrdom if
ever man did. He was actually
lynched in defiance of “due process
of law” to appease the thirst of those
of the North who were clamoring for
the blood of a victim. More than 140
witnesses, nearly all of whom were
Andersonville prisoners, testified at
his trial that not only did they not
see him kill or maltreat prisoners as
he was accused, bvrt that he always
sympathized with them, and night
and day did all that lay within his
power to alleviate their sufferings.
This testimony is borne out by James
Madison Page, of Michigan, himself
an Andersonville prisoner, in his re
cently published “True History of
Andersonville.”
The prosecution was able to pro
duce but a bare ten or a dozen wit
nesses to testify to the cruelties of
Capt. Wirz, and the testimony of a
Atlanta, Ga., Thursday, July 1, 1909
goodly number of those was success
fully impeached.
When James G. Blaine, who was
making his bid for the Presidency by
waving the bloody shirt, declared
that “neither the deeds of the Duke
of Alva in the Low Countries, nor
the massacre of St. Bartholomew,
nor the thumb-screws and engines of
torture of the Spanish Inquisition
began to compare in atrocity with the
hideous crimes of Andersonville,” he
doubtless forgot that it remained for
the enlightened Government of the
North to devise new means of torture
and to add new lustre to the Alvan
halo by making drugs a contraband
of war. Shut in as the South was,
how was Andersonville to combat dis
ease?
Gen. Sheridan’s boast that he had
burned more than 2,000 barns filled
with wheat and corn; had driven off
and killed every animal, including
even poultry, and destroyed every
mill and factory in the Shenandoah
Valley, leaving nothing to sustain hu
man life, not even that of the women
and Children, was but the echo from
every hillside in the South. Where
was Andersonville to get food for her
prisoners? Wherein was Capt. Wirz
to blame?
In August, 1864, the Confederate
Commissioner of Exchange informed
the Federal authorities that if they
would furnish transportation he
would turn over to them their ten or
fifteen thousand sick and w r ounded,
and if there were not that many he
would return enough well ones to fill
the quota. Yet this proposition was
not accepted until four months later.
It was between those dates that the
greatest mortality occurred. Who
was to blame for this? Assuredly not
Capt. Wirz.
That the death-rate of Anderson
ville was great no one denies, but if
we accept the reports of Secretary
Stanton, what are we to think of
Northern prisons where there was
food and drugs in abundance? His
reports show in round numbers 270,-
000 Federal prisoners in Confederate
prisons during the war with a mor
tality of 22,000, while there were
2 20,000 Confederate prisoners in
Federal prisons with a mortality of
26,000. Twelve per cent, of the Con
federate prisoners in Northern pris
ons died, while but 9 per cent, of the
Federal prisoners in Southern pris
ons died.

It is said that Earnest Willie Up

but pity his judgment, for there is
no use for a man to step into the fire
and not expect to be burnt.—Gwin

DETAILS NOT DESIRED.
An American, speeding over the
continent of Europe in his automo
bile, asked the chauffeur, “Where are
we?”
“In Paris,” shouted the man at
the wheeel, and the dust flew.
“Oh, never mind the details,” ir
ritably screamed the American mil
lionaire; “ I meant what continent.”
—Argonaut.
A JUDGE OF GOOD CHARACTER.
An old woman was profuse in her
gratitude to a magistrate who had
dismissed a charge brought against,
her.
“I thought you wouldn't be 'aid
on me, your worship,” she remarked,
as she left the dock; “I know 'ow
often a kind 'art beats be’ind a ugly
face.”—Tid-Bits.
THE AUTO STROP.
When the train stopped at the lit
tie Southern station, the Northern
tourist sauntered out on the plat
form. Under a scrub-oak stood a
lean animal, with scruggy bristles.
The tourist was interested. “What
do you call that?” he queried of a
lanky native.
“Razorback hawg.”
“Well, what is he doing rubbing
against that tree?”
“He's stropping himself, mister,
jest stropping himself.” Success
