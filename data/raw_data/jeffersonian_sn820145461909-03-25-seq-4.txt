A MOTHER’S QUESTION.
Soft waves of chestnut hair —gold in
the sun —
Red mouth, whose curving lips dim
pled with fun;
Skin fair and soft and smooth, cheeks
tinged with rose,
Eyes in whose smiling depths happi
ness glows,
Never the cloud of tears shadowed
their blue —
This was the mother’s face my baby
knew.
Hair white as driven snow, face seam
ed and drawn,
Pale lips with grief-lines marked, all
laughter gone,
Eyes dull and lustreless, faded by
tears,
Empty arms, aching heart, all these
long years.
Lord, if we meet again, by Thy dear
grace,
How shall my baby know his mother’s
face?
—Bohemian.
JOHN AND JIM.
Some years ago an old lady from
South Carolina related to the writer
some of her experiences during the
Civil War. One of the most interest
ing stories was of the bravery of her
two iboys aged ten and twelve years.
The eldest was John and the second
was Jim. One fine spring morning
these two boys were standing in the
road in front of their house when they
saw a regiment of Yankee soldiers
coming toward them. Their mother
looked out the window and saw them
too, and was much frightened. She
called to the lads to come in.
As they started towards the house
one of the soldiers advanced and said,
“Hey, Bud, have you got any horses
here?” John answered: “Yes.”
The soldier said: “Where are they?”
John said: “There they are,” point
ing to the lot. Then the soldier said:
“Come on, boys, let’s get a fresh
horse.” “No, you won’t,” said John,
at the same time calling to Jim to
come to him. The boys went into the
lot and turned the horses out, starting
in behind them in a gallop, while sev
eral soldiers advanced on their horses
and told them to stop. John and Jim
both exclaimed, “You shan’t have my
mamma’s horses,” and on they ran,
clapping their hands, whooping and
driving the horses at a rapid speed till
they came to an open place which had
been used as a pasture. When the
horses reached this place they each,
five in number, galloped off miles; the
boys ran back toward the house
laughing. The soldiers had chased
the boys, but to no avail, and were
still bent on getting them, when the
Colonel rode up and said: “Let those
horses alone; we have no time to trou
ble with them.” When the boys came
to where the greatest number of sol
diers were they saw them driving
thirteen cows away. John and Jim
said: “You let our cows alone; you
must not have our cows.” One pert
soldier said: “Oh yes, we must have
some steak today,” and continued to
drive the cows. When John saw that
they were making some headway with
Under The Vine and Tig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
the cows he placed himself in front
of the cows and screamed to the top
of his voice, “Hey, there, Pink!”
“Hey, Doll!” “Whoa, Bill! Come
here, Rose!” and so on till he called
the name of each one, when every cow
stopped still in the road and, do as
much as they could, the soldiers could
not make them move but a few steps
from where they stood. The Colonel
rode up and said: “Let us have the
cows, Sonnie.” Jim said, “You must
not have our cows.” “You shan’t
take them,” said John. “But what
if I take them any way?” said the
Colonel. “But you just must not
take our cows, sir,” said both. “ What
if I was to shoot them?” said the
Colonel. John, with his hat in his
hand, and one hand across his breast,
said: “(Sir, no one but a coward would
do that.” The Colonel eyed his men
and put spurs to his horse and left
without a word. The boys drove the
cows back into the lot, when they told
their mother what had'happened. She
was more frightend, but was glad to
save her stock. When the writer saw
the lady she was totally blind and
John was her sole comfort. Now all
of them have gone to the land of rest.

WOMAN’S SUFFRAGE QUESTION
IN ENGLAND.
Thirty or more English suffragettes
have just been sentenced to prison, for
varying terms of from one to two
months. These are not the first suffra
gettes to see the inside of an English
prison, and the subjects of this appli
cation of the law and the circum
stances connected with it show that
England has to deal with a very seri
ous movement.
These ladies were arrested because
they determinedly persisted in reach
ing the prime minister with their pe
tition, after they had been repeatedly
and emphatically warned to desist. It
may be accepted that they were ar
rested very unwillingly, and only as a
last resort deemed necessary to sup
press them. They demand the ballot
3effersonian
for Englishwomen, and this the gov
ernment determinedly and sternly op
poses.
After having been arrested and
tried, the sentence imposed upon them
was made still harsher by giving them
the severest terms of imprisonment in
“the second division,” according to
which the prisoners are to be humili
ated by being garbed in prison stripes
and held to the regulation prison
fare and prison rules of conduct. But
the sentence in each ease was to be
suspended upon a pledge of the de
fendant to abstain in future from ac
tive efforts in contending for women’s
suffrage. The severe sentences coup
led with this conditional pardon were
intended to cause ithese women to re
tire from active propaganda work,
but the purpose failed entirely. Not
one of these women weakened. Every
one of them promptly and positively
refused to make any pledge as to the
future, and all went to jail.
These were not shopgirls, nor wo
men of the lower classes of society.
On the contary, they were all women
of the upper classes, several of them
members of the nobility. Os course,
there are suffragettes also among the
workingwomen, who are ready to go
as far as these women did and to act
as their firm allies, but in' this in
stance it was women of wealth and so
cial standing alone who were the ag
gressors and violators of police orders.
In our country, to have sentenced
thirty ladies of wealth and high so
cial standing to prison like common
felons, merely for persistently seek
ing to present a petition to one high
in authority, would have been a stain
which American manhood could not
ha.ve withstood. The sanctity of the
law, or the despotism which exercised
it, would have been defied, and the
jail would have been stormed if the
women had not been quickly released.
Englishmen suffered this outrage to
be committed, but even they will not
stand such proceedings long. And,
when the determination of a large and
growing number of Englishwomen to
force women suffrage is so convinc
ingly demonstrated, it is plain that
the English government has to con
tend with a serious problem.
How long it will be, nor through
how much turbulence or tribulation
England will pass before its govern
ment will yield, can only be deter
mined by time, but that it will end
with the franchise being extended to
Englishwomen may no longer be
doubted. —Augusta Hera 1 d.

WOMAN SUFFRAGE PROGRESS.
The highest distinction which has
yet come to the cause of woman suf
frage throughout the world is un
doubtedly the victory won last month
by the suffragists in Sweden, when,
by a substantial majority in each
house of the Diet, a law was enacted
providing that hereafter all persons,
without distinction of sex, who shall
have attained a designated age and
who fill other prescribed conditions,
shall exercise the parliamentary fran
chise. Sweden is an independent
nation whose people are among the
most enlightened on earth, who ap
parently are quite willing to confide
to their women equal powers with
their men in deciding vital questions
of national welfare and defense. Wo
man suffrage now obtains in Norway,
Finland, New Zealand, the com
monwealth of Australia, and in four
of our Western States (Colorado,
Wyoming, Idaho, and Utah). The
victory for the suffragist cause in
Sweden has greatly encouraged advo
cates of that policy in England, who
have for the past three or four years
been conducting a campaign for the
suffrage right remarkable for its vig
or, persistence, and somewhat sensa
tional character. —American Review
of Reviews.
RUSSIAN WOMEN.
A Russian paid the following glow
ing tribute to the women of his na
tive land: “The women of Russia
combine the vivacity and wit of the
Frenchwoman with the industry and
thrift for which the women of Ger
many are famous. She is a- superb
wife and mother and withal a fine
mental worker. The Russian girl stu
dent is generally in the front rank at
the universities. Doubtless some of
her fine qualities are due to the fact
that in Russia women are free and are
in every respect considered to be the
equals of men. Russian women are
born politicians and diplomats and
so intensely patriotic that they es
teem no sacrifice too great for their
country; hence as revolutionists —
however misguided—they are infinite
ly more daring and devoted than the
men. Secrets have been wrung from
male revolutionaries by torture, but
never from the women.”
