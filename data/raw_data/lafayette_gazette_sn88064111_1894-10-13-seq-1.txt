"'ILl. HAVE THE LAW ON HiM."
D the best of friends and neighbors. ,
Scarcely a week elapsed without a
visit between the two families. b
Hiram Grigsby and Seth Stubblefield
exchanged work at corn-planting'and
harvest time, and their wives consulted n
each other on such momentous ques
IC tions as soft-soap. or apple-butter mak
ing. and the relative merits of Ply
mouth Rock and Black Spanish fowls
as layers and setters.
Tom Grigsby and Ben Stubblefield,
, n ell-known lads of sixteen and seven
teen years of age, had been chums
evtr since they were "little tackles."
'They attended "deestrick school"
together in winter, and went gunning t
or fishing, and helped each other pile d
shcks in the harvest field in summer. c
The daughters of the two families
e were also on the best of terms. They
exchanged patchwork scraps and
basque patterns, confided important
secrets to one another, and were, in
a. fact,. kindred spirits in every fespect.
?d This friendly intercourse continued
until the feud broke out, and all neigh
borly feeling was at an end.
Ilow the trouble began, or which
party was most to blame, it would be
f hard to' say. Doubtless there was
some fault on both sides.
At all events the hatchet was dug
11 up, and hostilities were carried on, un
gas til. from sympathizing friends, the two
families became relentless enemies.
Farmer Grigsby fenced up the little
pool which ran from his spring. and
from which his neighbor's stock had
been wont to quench their thirst for
years gone by.
99 Faftmer Stubblefield at once retali
ated by blocking the private road
through his woods pasture, thereby
- forcing the (rigsbys to drive two miles
" further around in hauling cord-wool ,
or taking their garden truck to market.
The well-trodden foot-path across
lots was neglected and grass-grown,
e and when the rival factions met at
church meetings, or basket-picnics and
other rural gatherings, they turned
their heads aside, or glared at one an
other with uncompromising hostility.
1. So the feud kept growing, until at
last it culminated in a lawsuit.
"'He'll sue me. will he?" blustered
* Farmer Stubblefield, red with anger.
"Let him go ahead, I say. He'll find
rs, out two kin play st that game. I
ils don't care if my cattle did tromp down
at his growin' corn. What'd he turn his
di- pigs inter my medder furP?"
ti- "I'd make him smoke fur it yet, if I
was you, seth," put in Mrs. Stubble
at field. "He 'lows he kin scare you by
goin' to law."
en- "'That's what I know," replied Seth,
giumpily. "But he'll haul in his horns
afore I'm through with him. rln show
him whose ole hog eat up the grind
stone!"
It was early in the springtime when
the puit was brought, but owing to the
lawadelays it was still unsettled when
Sharvest-time came on.

PLUCKY SWALLOWS. T
ow They nefaemd. Themselves Asatme The
he spamrrows.
There was a fourishing family of Hi
young barn-swallows just hatched out was
in a stanch mud-nest that clings to the silk
inside ledge of a jutting post-on a wide crea
balcony of a certain pretty Long Island his
house-quite an ordinary little swal- him
low's nest and very commonplace hun- en.
gry birdlings in it, but the family that thel
lives in the Long Island house regard gra_
the parent birds as the pluckiest pair ful
of housekeepers they ever knew. For way
three seasons in succession the swal- wits
lows, a handsome, lively pair of birds, asw
have come back to bill and coo and an
hatch their little brood in a mud-nest' girl
stuck to a pillar at the west end of the ' seal
balcony. er,
Some warm spring day they come roo
back, apparently just from a long trip I
in the south, and, perching on the of r
nest's edge, in loud, cheerful chirps in
discuss the necessary renovations and in
improvements. They then set prompt- pre
ly to work, toss out all the old lining "
of the year before, and down along the "y,
pond's edge or in the public highway sta
are seen industriously getting mud for lan
needed repairs. The work goes on for stir
a week usually before Mrs. Swallow air
begins to lay her eggs, and this year res
the swallow family came back to the son
old nest in due season and began to the
work on it. From their own pretty the
downy coats they pulled feathers for Yo
lining, and one egg was laid, when a loo
little gray chipping sparrow undertook we
to turn these honest folk out of their we
old home. She deliberately tossed the ful
new laid egg and down lining out and wa
began to lay in such twigs as she W1
thought best. ter
The swallows seemed indignant and vol
grief-stricken, but satisfied themselves aft
by giving the sparrow a sound scold- fai
ing, turning out her twigs and begin
ning to reline the nest. Another egg yo
was laid, and again in their absence col
the sparrow repeated her cruel trick. `e
This time the swallows punished the hi
destroyer of their home severely. They to
met her on the gravel path by the
balcony steps and Mr. Swallow struck
her such a blow with his stout, short on
bill that she fluttered, reeled, and fell
over on the gravel as though dead. tl
Then the swallows disappeared for a
' week. A' the end of that time they th
came back, selected- a ifnge -f a pillar
on the east end of the baieonv
and began to build a new home.
Knowing they were full two weeks be
hind all the other birds, they worked i
like beavers until in the space of our

though a few days late. Mrs. Swallow
hatched out as fine a family of young
ones as one would care to see and c1
was very little behind her neighbors in
r getting her babies on the wing. Every
night her good husband pcnt perched di
on a hook driven into one of the bal- f
Scony beams, from which a canary's cage
M hung, and in July the swallows disap

Not until the season arrives for mi

, September the swallows come back, sit I a
on the nest's edge, apparently talk over r

THE LAST HUMAN BEING. b
SSelentists Tell of Many Ways in WhLeh ian
Will Become Esxtinct.
The opinions of the leading scientists
of the world concerning the probable
fate of the last man are given below:
e i. The surface of the earth is slowly a
but surely diminishing: all the landed
m portion will at last be submerged and
the last man will be drowned.
2. The ice is gradually accumulating
at the north pole and slowly melting a
away at the south: eventually the
earth's center of gravity will suddenly
change and the last man will be crushed
by the rush of movables that will
quickly glide over its surface.
3. There is a retarding medium in
space, causing a gradual loss of velocity
in all of the planets. The earth, when
her revolutions finally cease, will be
drawn nearer and nearer to the sun
until the last man will be literally
roasted off the face of the earth.
4. The amount of water on the earth's
surface is slowly drying up; the last
man will die begging for a drop of
moisture with which to wet hisparched
tongue.
.a 5. A gigantic planet or comet is like
ly to tumble into the great sea of gas
which surrounds the sun. In that
h, event our great luminary would blaze
up and burn the earth and all the other
le planets to cinders.
ke 6. Beginning with the year o000 A.
D. humanity will commence to retro
grade, and by the end of the year 1,
n 000,000 man will be no larger and have
d, no more intelligence than a plant
ng louse. In that event there will be no
"last man."
th- 7. The sun's fires will gradually burn
out an'd the temperature cool in conse
ng quence; the earth's glacial zones will
ras enlarge, driving shivering humanity
)ld towards the equator. At last the
ng habitable space will lessen to nothing
of and overcrowded humanity will be
frozen in a heap.-St. Louis Republic.

He was carefully dressed. There one
was not the slightest blemish on his yon
silk hat. His trousers were carefully to

his stick in the approved fashion. With ' of n
him were two charming-looking wom- son
en. Their complexions were fresh,- th
their teeth white and small, and their eac]
gray eyes bright with an honest, mirth- Ar,
ful sparkle. They boarded a Broad- spo

with unconventional alacrity, the man
Sswinging himself to the platform with el
i an assumption of easy dignity. TheI
'girls plumped themselves down on a bre
Sseat and then crowded closely togeth- wh
f er, for the car was about full, to make spr
Sroom for him. bit
S"Sit here, George. There is- pleqty pob

I inches of space with a little hand that for
I in a mouse-colored glove looked very wh
- pretty. - theI
"Oh, no," said George, graciously.
"You will be more comfortable if I tee
. stand up." So the girls smiled and hei
r laughed and chatted, while he stood ea
r straight up with a lofty, "know-it-all" hai
r air' Those girls were delightful tothe pal
r rest of the passengers. There was we
e something about them that showed that si.
3 they were not New York girls, though egj
S they were dressed in the proper New sta
r York fashion. They were wholesome- Ch
a looking girls, who smiled when they -
c were pleased and laughed when they of
were amused. They were full of youth- san
ful spirits and their innocent frankness W1
was reflected in their pretty faces. f
e When they laughed they made no at- Pi
tempt to conceal the clear ring of their th
d voices. There was not the slightest be
s affectation in their manner; not the int
1- faintest trace of a "pose." sa
Every movement and posture of the ho
'g young man was studied to give him a
e cold, calm, superior appearance. If he b

his splendid hat and they skinned his li

Is- There was an alarm in the facet of " 14
the young women then, but when he v
o gathered up his hat and stick, and with u
sit a bored, uninterested look on his face, b
rer resumed as easy a position as circum- 11
at stance would permit, the countenances a
no of the girls changed. t
"A mnan-trap," he said, with calm f
scorn, and at that it came-two bursts a
of ringing laughter. They tried to stop, I
but they could not. He did look like a i
fool, standing tihre with a haughty a
an look on his face, but a battered hat on
his head, a passionless, steely eye, I
ble s t a skinned nose. Peal after peal
came, not loud and vulgar, but musical
and mirth-stirring. There was no I
