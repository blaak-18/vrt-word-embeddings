A Protect Against Destruc-

I am a bee-keeper. As a natural
result I am used to stings, “getting
it in the neck,’’ and almost every
where else at times, without think
ing anything much of it; but when,
some few weeks ago, I began to cir
culate a U. S. Monetary League peti
tion to Congress to prevent the de
struction of the greenbacks and the
silver dollar, the last of the people’s
money, I was agreeably surprised at
my reception among the people and
the rapidity with which I secured
some 500 signatures or more. In
fact, almost everybody would sign
after reading the petition, or after I
had explained its meaning. Such ex
pressions of enthusiasm and pleas
ure as “You bet, I’ll sign that two or
three times if you will let me.” “You
bet, we’ll all sign that; keep that go
ing,” etc., are quite common. Once
in a while, however, a man would
say, “The rascals: what are our
members in Congress for? They
should prevent such as this,” and
would evince an inclination, not to
sign the petition, but after being re
minded that it was the duty of the
people to watch what is being done
and tell their members in Congress
what they want done; and after sug
gesting what a weapon these peti
tions would be in the hands of our
Senators or members of Congress to
defeat any legislation that might be
introduced to destroy our good
money, I almost invariably secured
a signature.
Often some man in a group would
read the petition alond, creating
great interest and resulting in some
volunteering to work to secure sig
natures, and almost every man sign
ing. At Farmersburg the miners
took it to their Locals and brought
back such long lists of names; in
fact, everybody seems pleased that
some one is working to try to save
the silver dollar and greenbacks and
establish “Government money” equal
to all.
You may ask, Who is it that would
destroy, limit or stop entirely the
coinage of gold and all other “Gov
ernment money?”
Morgan’s Money Trust.
And why is it that the trust would
thus rob Uncle Sam of his right and
duty to supply us with a medium of
exchange?
1. Because the non-interest bear
ing Government money competes
with the more than $400,000,000 of
notes now circulated by the national
bankers of the trust.
2. Because the trust would like to
hog the whole business of supplying
the currency. Then by lending, or
refusing to lend, us their vicious
substitute for money (national bank
notes), they could by thus control
ling the volume of the circulating
medium determine wages and the
price of all commodities absolutely.
Besides, Morgan wants to put his
notes in the place of those $946,000,-
000 in greenbacks and silver dollars
which the Government now circu
lates without interest. Then his
notes loaned out at lawful interest,
compounded at the several periods,
would wring from the American peo
ple a yearly tribute of nearly $90,-
000,000, or one dollar per head. In
other words, the country now gets
$34 6,000,000 in greenbacks and
$600,000,000 in silver dollars free
of charge, whereas Morgan’s notes
to replace them will cost $90,000,-
000 per annum. In addition to this,
he wants a nice little central bank
at Washington, D. C., into which the
funds of the National Treasury and
all other banks will flow. All that
would be nice for King Morgan and
his pals;, but whom else will it bene
fit? In fact, the sum and substance
of the whole matter is that Morgan
wants to so centralize, systematize
and remodel the present gigantic
machine of monetary exploitation
(the national banking system) so
that it will run so smoothly in its
business of supplying us with a sub-
stitute currency that it will just
make a break at the point of a maxi
mum of robbery with a minimum of
failures.
No sirree, Bob! wq don’t want
anything like that. What we do
want, and need badly, however, is
that Congress^the Government) de
termine the volume, create, and pay
into circulation all the money, as per
the Constitution. Let it be made
out of what Congress deems best and
secured by the entire wealth and
credit of the nation, every dollar
equal and a lawful tender for debt.
As to the “rubber” (expanding and
contracting properties), if any of
that is needed let the Government
furnish that also. Then we’ll have
no panics, and will have as safe a
financial system as it is possible for
any nation to have.
In conclusion, I respectfully ask
every friend of right and justice to
write to me for blank petitions to
Congress to save the silver dollar
and the greenbacks, the last of the
people’s free money. I will forward
same at once, and ask you to send
me great lists of names, which I will
then forward to Senator Benj. F.
Shively to present in the Senate of
the United States to help defeat the
dastardly scheme of Aldrich, Taft &
Co., agents and tools for the Morgan
Money Trust.
Senator Shively has the gun (offi
cial position), but he wants ammuni
tion (names). Boy, let’s get busy,
and send him a lot of it.

THE OLD-TIME DINNER HORN.
The notes that swelled from Tasso’s
lyre,
Infused with rich Italian fire,
Nor lute that trilled through Tyrean
halls
Gave half the bliss my soul recalls.
Adown a threescore years’ elapse,
With solemn pace and memory taps,
Comes ancient melody reborn —
I hear the old-time dinner horn!
T-o-o-t, toot, t-o-o-t! That welcome
strain
Rang o’er the hill and down the
lane;
Not dearer notes from martial fife
E’er called to arms for battle’s strife.
Sing not to me of dying Greece,
The pomp of war or pipe of peace,
But just midway to dusk from morn
Resound the old-time dinner horn.
The rustic swain, his plow behind,
Plods drowsily with head reclined;
Anon the corn blades green are
stirred,
A piercing, welcome peal is heard;
The old mule halts midrow and
turns —
“Gee,” “haw” and “whoa” alike she
spurns,
Nor heeds the wreck of waving corn
To seek the old-time dinner horn.
The songs that thrilled the Thracian
soul,
Nor wine that graced Anacreon’s
bowl;
No viands rich and rare could vie
With old “corn pone” and “pumpkin
pie.”
The boyhood dreams and homely
joys
No after life or state alloys.
Can Gabriel on the judgment morn
Efface the old-time dinner horn?

The Call Direct
Fearful lest, in allowing his peo
ple to go up to Jerusalem and do
reverence to Jehovah in the God
given way, he should lose his king
dom to Rehoboam, Jeroboam, King
of Israel, established a worship of
his own.
Standing by his heathen altar, in
the very act of offering incense
thereon, he is startled into a venge
ful anger by the sudden appearance
and awful warning of a prophet from
Judah.
Convinced that he is a messenger*
of God, by the twofold miracle of in
stant paralysis to his violent, out
stretched arm, and, at the prophet’s
prayer, its sudden restoration, Jero
boam presses him to accept refresh
ment and reward. Repeating God’s
positive command to the contrary,
the seer firmly refuses, and goes his
way.
Able to resist manifest evil while
in the strength of inspired zeal, he
yet, during the inevitable exhaustion
following, yields weakly to the seduc
tion of pretending good.
The motive actuating the old
old Israelitish prophet in his effort
to bring the prophet from Judah
back, is not stated; but I can’t help
believing there is jealousy, in part at
least. Living in the midst of this
bold idolatry, he has been either too
indolent or too timid to rebuke.
And shortly we find this messen
ger from Judah, who obeyed the
lying pretender rather than God’s
voice direct to his own soul, hearing
his condemnation; and this time the
message comes through the source
he had chosen to believe, —and in

preme authority. Combining all the knowledge or writers on
this question, from dawn of history to the present time, ap

the midst of the eating and drinking

Sad and humiliated, we may well
believe, he is again started on his
journey, but this time equipped by
man’s hand, ahd the end is not far
to see: death, with the lion, which
in the strength of the Lord he might
have slain with his weaponless hands,
standing over his body.
This Bible story has many editions
in modern type. Many prophets in
Isreal, living among conditions which
they should rebuke, aryl do not, be
stir themselves when the voice of
Judah’s prophet is heard, and seeks
to turn him from his way. And
many of these messengers, after
striking the first blow valorously,
are glad to turn back, and believe in
an easier way. Sent back a second
time by the seducer, who is at last
forced to acknowledge the righteous
ness of their mission, they are but
poorly equipped and fall by the way.
The prospects before a reformer
are not cheering, and they who
would accuse them of selfish mo
tives should think on this. Only the
bravest and truest can stand the
clamor of exposed evil, bear without
bitterness the ignorant abuse of
those whom they would save, smile
cheeringly on their pitifully thin
ranks of supporters, and, turning
resolutely from the seducer’s whis
per, listen only to that Voice which
says: “What are these things to
thee? Follow thou Me.”
