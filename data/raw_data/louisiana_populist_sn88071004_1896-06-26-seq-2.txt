FRIDAY, June 26, 18g6
There is already a disposition in
certain q(uart'ers, high up in the
Populist manatgemient, to attribute
the Oregon victory to the fact that
the Populists confined their cami
paign to silver alone. This might
work hut for the fact that the old
party candidates were also nearly
all for silver. The fact therefore
that the people preferred Populists
t-, the others showed that there was
something else lbsides silver that
attracted. In other words Popu
lism, with all that the name im
plies, was the winning card in Ore
gon.-Noneonformist.
The Democrats of Natchitoches
are "amoosin' cusses." After yel
ling for the militia to enable them
to steal the parish, they met a few
days ago to elect delegates to the
Democratic State convention, and
congratulated the party on the fact
that the steal had been a success.
Among the delegates chosen were
Freeman, who stole the sheriff's of
fi e; Caldwell, who stole a legis
lative seat belonging toJ. A. Tetts;
G. L. Trichel, who stole a senator
ship, and M. J. Cunningham, who
stole an attorney-generalship. Rob
in Hood's men once assembled to
congratulate their clan that com
mon honesty was yet alive, and
"pointed with pride" to their past
deeds in the marauding line. Mr.
Hood and friends should have lived
in Natchitoches.-THE OsERvox,
in Daily Item.
In these rushing times for office
hunting the following from the
Atlanta Con'stitutipn flls the bill:
"John, wher's yer daddy r"
"He'seot yander gettin' beat fer
coroner."
"An' yer uncle I"
"Seein' how clost he kin come

"An' Bill-wher's he I"
S"*Well, Bill don't 'mount ter
moueh, an' I've bearn tell they're

Teller vs. McKinley.
The bolt 4.f Sten:ator Henry 3M.
' Teller from the eplihlic:an party
furnishes the first real opportuni
ty for the D)emiocrats to win the
ftight this fall.
Those ieln who have led the Denm
r ocratic irty when in power, and
r. failed to secureC free silver, can
(h:ardly inspire the free siliver hosts
outsilde that party, and draw them
I to its support.
So if the I)Democratic party would
will, and its only hopl, is to agree
with the HRepliblicatns on taritf and
with the l'opulist'. on free silver,
le It it nominate Senator 'Teller for
its standard-he'arer. and his nomi
nation will be heartily indorsed I,
- the Populits aIt St. Louis, Jully"
22nd.
r Such a imian as Teller, who has
been friendly to the South and an
id(ol of the West, and who has the
` confidence of the entire country for
integrity and ability, can unite the
Sreat masses of this country on
l the two grandest principles of
American economy--free silver
and protection-and lead them to
victory.
If the Democratic party should
1do this it would astonish the world
by doing the wisest thing it could
do under the present situation.
On this combination Teller would
sweep this State against McKinley,
and likewise almost every other
State South of the Potomac and
West of Pennsylvania.
Under this plan the Populists
would come in for little or none of
the "spoils," but they would be
absolutely and sure of free silver
and protection, and 9-tenths of
them would te satisfied, while the
l)eumocratic politicians by reason
of the size of their organization
would control nearly all the ap
pointments, and would therefore
be happy.
If this is not done there will be
throee Presidential tickets in the
field, and the Populists and Repub
licans will combine on a joint elce
toral ticket in this State, and will
carry it overwhelmingly.
On The War Path.
R. L. CASPARI, SECRETARY
TO LIEUTENANT
Governor Snyder Acts Disgrace
fully and Is Jailed.
R. L. Caspari, of Natchitoches,
is Lieutenant Governor Snyder's
private secretary.
Saturday night he took in the
local sights; also a lot of fire wna
ter. He finally wended his way to
the corner of Burgundy and Cus
tomhouse streets, where he acted
like a Comanche Indian, and be
cause the blue-coated guardians of
the peae told him to cease his
war dano and yells he vowed with
terrible oaths that he would wipe
every policeman off the face of the
Crescent City's earth.
But Caspari was not in Natchi
toches, and before he realized it,
he was peering through the bars of
the third precinct station. This
morang he faced Judge Bezou,
charged with being drunk, disturb
ing the peace and resisting an offi
cer.
The court gave him $1Q or twen
ty days, and he left minus ten dol
lars.-I)Dily Item.
There is no use asking Populists
to endorse the Democratic ticket
beesmse their convention declares
for silver. There are many Popn
lists who, under no eircumstances,
will listen to any such proposition.
Even if all their press and leaders
should try to persuade them, it
could not be dmone. The only re
sult woould be a hopeless split in
the party and the complete des
truction of its ueesfln.e.--Non

Political Situation in Lou

Ii- nces to the Time-honorded

ini.., the Attairs of (Our
r7. B at: .e,
O()r Will They I)canmd :a Fair
IElection, and IIHave It.
To every generation of men and
every political party that has ever
n existed is given, one Ipart or phase
e of some great problem to solve.
)Our immedliate predecessors had
C to deal with the black man Ibond
n age in this country. With the alb
olition of slavery came still graver
r matters. We are charged with se
o curing industrial freedom, so that
n:en may not only own and control
1 their muscles, hIut that they shall
I get what they earn, and themselves
enjoy the profits.
i That, if I ulnderstand the mean
ing of lPopulism, is the time mis
sion of our party. To-day we are
contronted in LouisianL with a
situation that is fairly demorali
zing to the best interest of our fair
State. We have barely escaped a
political revolution from the sim
ple fact that n:en have been denied
the right to express their political
views. The l)euwcr:itic party in
the State of Lou-iiuna to-dby as
sinies the right to perpetua:te its
lp)-oer by iraud and intimidation,
and thereby nulify the best inter
est of our St:ate.
From 1174 to '7., we were con
fronted with the question of negro
-domination. A few carpet-baggers
with the negroes, assumed the I
right to govern our State, The 1
Carpet-baggers would pass the c
word along the line to the negroes, I
and they would mass and in solid
phalanx to the support of any men- 1
sure they miight suggest. Their
manner of governing the affairs of
our State was so thoroughly antag
onistic to the wishes of the masses
of the white men of our State
that they rose up in arms and rebel- 1
led against it. To-day we are con- c
fronted with a condition of affairs t
not very much unlike the days of t
'74 and 'T8. A party of political
Ixolloers marching under the ban
nor of Democracy anlcallin them- i
selves Democrats, are to-day con- 1
trolling the affairs of o:uj State.
How ! With the negro votes. )Do
the negroes believe with them, and
vote with them ? No ! Then how I
do they utilize their votes ? By 1
stealing them in such places as (
they can and by intimidation where 1
they are watched. (
Compare the party of l.74 with c
the party of 18.)6. This is the I
difference; the party of '74 divi
ded the boodle and offices with the I
negroes, but the party of '96 takes I
all the offices and keeps all the t
twboodle. This aught to encourage
every colored man in Louisiana to 3
effect an organization to get his
people to stay out of politics.
They can't hope to ever dominate
in politics, and as long as they al- -
low themselves to be used they will
only serve to satisfy the wishes of
some office seeker, and will never
be the party to accomplish any (
great principle. They were used a
against us on April 21st in quanti- a
ties large enough to satisfy Foster I
and his minions. A word of cheer *
passed along our lines when we
were assured that the legislature t
would pass ap election law that r
woukl insure fair elections and give
us a constitutional convention with
unrestricted powers. But our
hopes are being blighted, over
half the semsion is out and nothi
has yet been done towards reform.1
SFoster's minions seem to prefer
Sthe same old system of ballot boxi
stulf$ag rather than any system that
Swould satisfy the best people ofl a
our State. I
They have the power to pass U
such laws as will insure the peace i
-and plrj"lt rity of our p),o)i. If

c is clear a. s t the lllto enl ii tof lto -

i we havey Ibeen madi:e to eat grass :is

i insinhtion is not true, for while
our board tills arc yet unpai(d, we
ii are still suIl)sistin, upon :1 grani
lI vorous and c:arnivorous as well as
n herbivorous d(lit.
Inasmuch :as our flirtation wit's
s the Citizens' LelgIue has not allict
, ed us as Nebuchadnezzar's sin li I
-him, we object to the imputation
and ask that you retract your un
fair allusions.
a We are sorry (for you) that you
s cannot see that in the Senatorial
o fight we used the C. L. much like
e the angry lancers (id the lrompt
e or whom they wanted to pitch out
of a window, but upon reflection
I saved hint for a club with which
Sthey knocked the fiddler down stairs
r True, the C. L. did not vote to
f go Iehin( the returns, but they
were splendid clubs with which to
s demolish Trezcvant and BHinchard.
D These two worthies who have
- been hlareiack riding the farmers
- of North Louisiana for niry years,
s are now bundles of dead aspirn'
f tions; while McEnery and his New
SOrleans friends, who have lswen
- "gall and wormwooxd" to said leag
- ures, have by our indirect efforts
- been suddenly Irought back to vig
orous life and pernicious activity.
In other words, the Pops have
1 no reform legislation an(l no like
Slihood of getting any, but their
worst enemies in the State are
dead; while the league has no re
form legislation and no likehhood
of getting any and their worst lo
cal enemies are in the sadd(lo for
SFederal pie.
The score is, therefore, "one
Shorse" on the Citizens' Legstre it
ftvor of the Pops, who are still "at
the bat" crying "next !"
SPlease make due correction in
your "next" and oblige
SYour patient friends, who were
born in iadversity, hut get there,
