LETTERS F<HOW THE PEOPLE
Dade City, Fla., Nov. 6, 1908.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson,
Thomson, Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson: The election
is over and Bryan is overwhelmingly
defeated and with him goes down
forever the Democratic party, as
known for many years. If my posi
tion is true, it means that Populism
is bom again, and salvation has come
to our republic at last, and,
like Samuel, I come to anoint
you, before the time, as the
next president of these United
States, for in all our wanderings in
the political wilderness, you alone
have stood firm for those principles
of true Democracy that have made us
what we are. Tariff, money and rail
roads are the three great issues of
this country. The Republicans and
Democrats virtually stood together on
these, and hence no choice so far as
the vital issues are concerned. Na
turally, one must die. You, almost
alone, have kept the gospel of true
Democracy before the people and now
is your opportunity come to you of
necessity, and nothing can prevent or
stop the growth of Populism in the
next four years. Blow the whistle
now and let the mighty car roll out
from the station and begin to move
over this country, marked on its
coaches, F. P. G. 0. R. R. —Free
Trade, Postal Savings Banks, Govern
ment Ownership of Railroads. I en
close $1 for your paper.
Very respectfully,
0. N. Williams.
Gillett, Arkansas County, Ark.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson.
My Dear Friend: I want to let
you know w 7 ho lam and what I stand
for. First, I am an old Confederate
soldier, born in old Scott county in
Mississippi, went in the war at first
call, got through, and have been one
of the old guard Populists since its
organization. Have been in reform
cause from the time the Grange was
organized, and I want to assure you K
my friend, that I will stand by you
and your political policy to the end
of time with me. I read both of your
publications, and will continue to read
and press your doctrine at all times
and any and everywhere. I have been
talking with the old politicians of
my county for years, and they have
fought me as hard as they could any
man of my power in politics. I have
been defeated twice for county and
probate judge by the influence of the
politicians of the county; they even
brought in the influence of such men
as state senators to down me. I am
not running for office, but am fighting
them just as hard, and you will get
several votes through my influence.
Populists are not dead, but disorgan
ized, but they are coming, and will
continue to come. If it were not for
Billy Bryan as a catspaw for Wall
street, to divide the people, they
would come to you by the thousands
and tens of thousands, but he has
about done his do this time. I am
glad to see your determination not to
be outdone, that you are going to
call a conference as soon as the elec
tion is over, and I hope great good
will come out of it. I have given the
people’s platform to many, with
yours and Judge S. W. Williams’
speeches of acceptance, with the re
quest they would read them. Even
the hardest cases say they are all
right, but many say you have no
chance. I ask them if Bryan or Taft
would have any chance if the voters
should declare against them. They
say no, I reckon not. Poor excuse, I
tell them. I will vote for what I
want if I cast the only vote for it,
then I w T ill be with you.
Say, don’t you think old Bro. T. H.
Tibbles has been sending me Mr.
Bryan’s paper, The Commoner, and I
think Mr. Bryan is making an ass of
himself if I can read aright, but,
through modesty, I am not going to
say so. I have just read Mr. Bryan’s
Omaha speech and it is an empty
vase, if there is anything in it I fail
to find it. He tells what is demo
cratic sometimes, but if his Denver
platform declares it I fail to find
Democracy attached to it.
May God in his great mercy spare
you, as he did Moses, to bring the
oppressed out of bondage, is my
prayer.
Your friend and coworker,
E. B. Langham.
Arlington, Ga., Nov. 7, 1908.
Dear Mr. Watson:
It is all over, and we are beaten,
but thanks be to the powers that be,
the other fellow got beat too. And
various are the causes. Early county
would have gone into the Watson col
umn, but in two of the strongest pre
cincts, they never opened the polls.
They have quit paying managers and
clerks in Early county and for that
reason no election was held in two of
our strongest precincts. I want to
Miller county just before election. I
think I did some good distributing
sample copies of The Jeffersonian.
Enclosed please find 50 cents in
stamps for Jeffersonian for six
months’ subscription. So please send
Jeffersonians to T. J. Rambs, Col
quitt, Miller county, Ga.
Very truly yours,
W. P. Andrews.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Friend: I did all I could for
you on the third of November and
found many who believed in our
principles. Organization is what is
wanted. I am heartily in accord
with your plan to unite the South
'and West, and am anxious for the
movement to begin. There will be
an old soldiers’ reunion at Mobile
on November twenty-fourth, twenty
fifth and twenty-sixth. The program
will contain several features of en
tertainment, and will draw a large
crowd. I want you to consent to be
there to fire the first gun for the
uniting of the two great agricultural
sections. If you will come, let it be
known through the weekly Jefferso
nian, and I will go to work to secure
subscribers for it, and also send no
tice to the Mobile Item. I am a
blind man and can’t get around
among the people as I would like to,
but will do my best.
73 be Jeffersonian
Hoping for a favorable considera
tion by you, I am,
Very respectfully,
W. 0. Kyle.
Jeddo, Ala. *
Davison, Mich., Oct. 14, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I haven’t seen a copy
of the platform on which you are
now running. May I have one? Do
you put out a text-book? Stamps
enclosed.
I am at a great loss how to vote.
The trend of Republican, Democratic
and Socialist parties is away from
individualism —Democracy and the
Prohibitionists are quite as bad.
Persia, Russia, Turkey, homes of
tyranny, despotism, nationalism and
imperialism, are turning to Democ
racy. India demands autonomy;
China is awakening to the voice of
personal liberty; the South Sea
Democracies lead the world; England
and Switzerland are close followers,
and the Spanish Peninsula writes its
demand for personal self-government
in blood.
And now comes Mr. Bryan posing
as the arch Democrat, advocating
such imperial pow T ers to the nation as
government ownership of railroads;
bank guarantee fund; limit of out
put of owners of patents, copyrights,
etc., to 50 per cent of output, and
other as intensely imperialistic and
nationalistic powers to the State at
the expense of the individual. And
no one seems to notice that Mr.
Bryan is outbidding the Republican
party with imperial plans for the
sole purpose of vote getting.
E. Hollenbeck.
P. S.—What is your definition of
Democracy? Here is mine: The
widest measure of self-government
to the individual consistent with ex
istence of the State.
I define Nationalism as the widest
measure of power to the State con
sistent with existence of the indi
vidual.
E. H.
Odum, Ga., Nov. 3, 1908.
Mr. Thos. E. Watson.
Dear Sir: Will say to you that the
fight is over in our district. There
were about 120 registered voters in
our district. We polled 66 votes out
of that number and you won 55 of
them, Bryan won 10, Taft 1.
Bryan’s followers confused our
crowd by arguing to them that they
had taken part in the June primary
and were in duty bound to support
Bryan, and for fear they were, they
would not vote at all. But I want to
say to you there were but two young
men that voted for Bryan. Two of
the old rock-ribbed fellows of the
past stepped up and polled their votes
for you like men. If Bryan is de
feated we won’t have much opposi
tion in our district. Will feel in the
morning like we had won a powerful
victory. Will rally to the cause of
the people in the morning as a fresh
set of soldiers. Would be glad if you
would publish through The Jefferso
nian how the election went as near
as you can. What we see in it we be
lieve.
The Reason I write you this is to
let you know, for I don’t have any
idea that you ever see it
through our newspapers. Some frieiTd
will let you know tomorrow how the
county went.
Want you to know this, that we
have whipped the fight in our district.
If Bryan is defeated we won’t have
any more trouble.
Will close, wishing you much suc
cess.
C. D. Pittman.
Opelika, Ala., Nov. 1, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: In another thirty-six
hours the campaign will be a thing
of the past, and while we all know
there is no hope for it to land you
in the White House, yet you have
won the greatest victory of all, and
we trust that the time may come
when you will see the complete tri
umph of our principles. I did all I
could for you with the means at
hand, and I now pledge my support
to you as long as you stand by and
fight for Jeffersonian Democracy,
which, I feel sure, will be throughout
the remaining years of your life.
J. Roy McGinty.
Soldiers’ Home, Ohio, 12th Ward.
October 23, 1908.
Tom, old boy, you are funda
mentally on the right track. Pull the
throttle, and let her rip. Your At
lanta speech was a clincher. Make
another and put it in The Jefferso
nian. Every one can swear by the
Atlanta speech. It comes home to
the heart and brains of every voter.
If let alone, every voter prefers to
vote for principles which he knows
are right. Sometimes a financial
wrong miay for a time benefit the
wrong-doer, but it is damaging to
those to whom the wrong is done.
Is it not? I ask you to emphatically
convey this idea in your speeches—
with your usual variations.
Addison R. Titus.
Canon, Ga., Nov. 4, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: A very light vote polled
in this county; rained in the after
noon, and lost a large per ceht of the
country vote.
Canon district: Watson 82, Taft
36, Bryan 16. Franklin county.
Watson 329, Taft 253, Bryan 379.
I firmly believe if we had had an
efficient State organization, we would
have carried the State for our ticket
by a good majority.
Yours truly,
A. J. Owens.
TICKETS LATE.
Lyons, Ga., Nov. 7, 1908.
Mr. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Your tickets received
November 4, 3 p. m. But with all
that, I sent to Mr. Tate Newton at
Ohoopee, Ga., and got some, and di
vided them with another district. We
had a pooi turnout. But of 25 votes
Bryan got one and Taft got two. It
looked to me like you would be elect
ed if it was left with us.
J. H. Cowart.
