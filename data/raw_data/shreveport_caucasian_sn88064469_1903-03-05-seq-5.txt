foreign buyers get their models. From
the displays already made by the mil
liners it appears that there is a tend
ency to decrease the size of the hat,
" while the broad flat effect is relieved
by a sharp upward turn of the brim or
d mounted up floral garniture. The curves
- and shaping to the broad brims of the
new hats indicate a desire toward in
diriduality and the suiting of chic cha
peaux to various types of face.
The smart Monte Carlo hat always
shows a liberal display of floral decora
tion: Parma violets and roses, not to
! speak of primroses and mimosa, all
have their turn on the spring models.

STHE NEW MATERIALS.
All Sorts of Wash and Thin Silk
Fabries-Chic Spring Models.
Wash fabrics for midsummer wear
are already being shown, and experi
enced shoppers declare that now is the
time when selections should be made,
as every line is complete and exclusive
novelties are soon e:hausted. One of
the daintiest of diaphanous fabrics is a
light, sheer gauze striped with mer
cerized lihes of more solid weave, also
In white. At intervals a:re ribbon stripes
of dresden pattern alnd the price is (S
cents a yard. The colors in which this
last eatrct is obtainabie include blue,
pinK and bl:ck and .white.
Merceiriz:,d madras is one of the most
serviceable materials for shirt waists.
as it washes and wears very well.
Nothing looks more fresh and clean
than the white grounds with small
mercerized stripes of self color set with
tiny blocks of the same. Figures, dots
or wee little squares of color in broken
lines are showered over the entire sur
face. The price is 28 cents a yard, and
the material exceptionally fine and
nice. One of the best designs is a tri
angle of tiny dots In blue, black or red.
French canvas is a new material es
pecially adapted for shirt waists. and
has a good, strong body and smart
weave. Stripes of color defined with
an edge of black are alternately solid
and lacy in effect. The price is 55
cents.
Oxford shirting is again to the fore
and costs but 18 cents a yard. A good
pattern is of tiny squares made of
triple half moons centered with a dot.
Mercerized cheviot is still another va
riety of these wash fabrics and can be
recommended for shopping oilwalking
costumes in a pretty design of broken
checks. The effect is not unlike the
shepherd's checks used so much last
summer, but yet sufficiently different
to be new-price, 39 cents a yard. This
comes in different sizes and in black
and white or blue and white. Large
solid spots are a favorite design for
plain materials, a rose silk and linen
pongee being patterned with these dots
in a less definite shade of the same
colors and costing 18 cents. This comes
in blue and other light shades as well.

cents ante both good purchases and rea
sonable in price.
Marky of the new foulards show satin
stripes and figures in the same shade
as the ground and forming a part of It,
the patterns scattered regardless over
them. However: almost all the higher
priced foulards are silk finished, as it
is affirmed that the satin finish will no
longer be grande mode, except in the
very finest quality, having been found
inferior in durability when expense has
had to be seriously considered.
White foulards patterned with black
are again upon the summit of populari
ty i th modish women and. certainly
are not to be outdone in smartness by
any other combination, though next in a
order is that delightfully soft green
known as"reseda.
Most chic and beautiful is a black
satin finished foulard,. scattered with
a round moon effect of dots in self col
or, which are more or less visible as the
light happens to strike them. The
whole fabric ip then showered with
tiny pin points and further embellished
with undulated stripes of white in dif
ferent widths. The effect is entirely
unusual and remarkably good. The
price is $1.75 a yard. .
Vogue, the source of the foregoing
item, illustrates some taking spring
and summer gowns. The first figure
shows a dark blue striped summer silk.
The three pieced skirt has a flounce
laid in inverted box plaits and straps
and tabs of white taffeta. The natty
little shirt waist is smartened with a
white taffeta box plait, stock and col
lar. The belt is of black patent leather,
the hat black and white straw, with a
bandeau of black moire ribbon.
The spotted black and white pique of
the'second figure has a circular skirt
trimmed with two groups of wide tucks
and mitered straps of white linen, a
plaited pounce and inverted back. The
shirt waist shows four plaits front and
back, a box plait, yoke straps and belt
of white linen and bishop sleeves with
linen cuffs. A stock of red satin and ii
a burnt straw outing hat trimmed with b
red satin give a lively touch of color to .
the whole.
Add For Manieuriag,
The best manicure acid is a teaspoon- f
ful of lemon juice in a cup of tepid wa
ter. This Sot only whitens and removes
all stains from the nails, but it loosens
the cuticle much better than scissors
do.

ities are easily discerned in the built in
seat and the staircase of white painted
wood, with a contrasting note of color
brought in by the adoption of. cherry
spindles. The square panels and the
Ionic capital and column add to the
architectural value. The side lights at
each side of the front door and two
side windows (one on the stair land
ing) are of clear and stained glass. The
wall paper is a cherry' red in the dull
tones of the spindles, and the floor is of
hardwood covered with rugs. An old
time spinning wheel stands inone cor
ner of the hall.
The compactness of every item con
nected with the culinary department
is one of the happy accomplishments in
a house that wears well. A woman in
speaking of her own kitchen said, "It
is the roomiest place in the house, but
I wish the space was somewhere else."
The large kitchen is not a labor sav
ing device, It in fact makes more work
and consumes more time than the one
of smaller size.
Sliding doors between the dining
roodn and parlor are a convenience of
ten overlooked until it is too late to
supply them. They are most necessary
in this particular location of the house
to give the privacy demanded at meal
times. To the housekeeper their need Is
no less urgent on cleaning days.
A pretty treatment of a double door
way is the hanging of a thick green net
with a heavy mesh that does not en
tirely exclude the light.

Embroidered letters for marking ijb

crochet workk is so popular again thie
cleve! idl'n has occurred to ine worker
to utilize it in th making of these let
ters. The letters are done in what is
known as Irish crochet. which is so

needle occasionally, %ut tot 4b an!
gTreat extent. A stitch here and ther
has been employed to give the correct
expression to the leaves, and the orna
ments are all made separately ud
sewed on.
The skillful worker should be able to
construct her own designs for such lets
ters, those sketched here being only iW
tended as suggestions.
The round ornaments of various sizes
are all made on the same plan, either
with or without an edge. The cotton is
wound round a knitting pin until the
required thickness has been attained
and single treble then worked all
round. They are all made round and
pinched into the shape required.
The Figure bi Today.
Tall, slepder women have iL all the
own way. The perfect figure has bee
discussed of late, and the fiat seems 1
be that slenderness combined wit
good lines is essential. But it is r
good being thin unless you are willow
and grqceful. The taller, the moi
slender, the better; the shoulder
broad, the arms long, the waist line i
the front long, the, hips well shaper
neither flat nor hollow. The line mu!
be straight from under the arms to th
Mnkle. There must be a slight outwar
curve at the back of the waist. It
the greatest mistake to pad over tb
hips. One of the artifices of a fashioi
able eorsetiere is to lace the hips into
lat line. Stays grow longer and consi
quently far less comfortable, but whil
they lengthen below the waist they bi
some shorter above.
A Good Batter Pudding.
A good batter pudding is made b
beating two eggs, adding one cupft
of milk, three and a half cupfuls o
sifted flour, three tablespoonfuls o
melted butter, one-half of a teaspoor
ful of salt, one tablespoonful of sugai
two teaspoonfuls of baking powder an!
one scant cupful of canned cherries o
any small fruit. Turn this into a, wel
greased mold, cover and place in
steamer or pot of boiling wates fo
two and a half hours. Serve with it
creamy sauce.
