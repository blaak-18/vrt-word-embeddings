FATE.
Two shall be born the whole wide
world apart,
And speak in different tongues and
have no thought
Each of the other’s being, and no
heed;
And these o’er unknown seas to un
known lands
Shall cross, escaping wreck, defying
death;
And all unconsciously shape every
act,
And bend each wandering step to this
one end
That one day out of darkness they
shall meet,
And read life’s meaning in each
other’s eyes.
And two shall walk some narrow way
of life
So nearly side by side that should >
one turn
Ever so little space to left or right,
They needs must stand acknowledged
face to face;
And yet with wistful eyes that never
meet;
With groping hands that never clasp,
and lips
Calling in vain to ears that never
hear,
They seek each other all their weary
days,
And die unsatisfied, and this is Fate.
—Susan M. Spalding.
MYSTERY ABOUT THE MAINE.
The Sulzer bill providing for the
raising of the Maine and the burial
of the 63 seamen now held in the
wreck, has been before the house com
mittee on naval affairs nine months,
and it promises to die in its hands.
A call for letters and data brought
forth nothing of value or public in
terest. But all feel that there is some
reason why influential men at Wash
ington do not desire to see the Maine
raised.
The Spanish contingent in Cuba say
the Americans refuse to raise the
Maine because the fact would then
stand exposed that the ship was sunk
by an interior explosion —that the
Spaniards had nothing to do with the
explosion, and that American officers
should be punished for the loss of the
ship.
iße all that as it may, there is hesi
tation over an appropriation, say,
$200,000, for the raising of the ship.
“No American,” said Mr. Sulzer, “is
afraid of the truth.” This is no doubt
true of the great propoi t im of our
citizens, but it is plain there is a
small circle at Washington which is
able to defeat year after year any at
tempt to appropriate money for the
raising of the Maine. In other words,
there is a degree of mystery in the
case. —Birmingham Age-11 craid.
THE GOOD STEEL TRUST.
Evidence before the congressional
committee which is investigating the
absorption of the Tennessee Coal and
Iron Company by the United States
Steel Corporation, throws a new light
on the “Good Samaritan ism” by
which the latter gained absolution
from the president. Mr. Grant B.
Schley, who was one of the syndicate
holding the.control of the Tennessee
company, admits that his firm was
the object of serious attack at that
time. “We were under great stress,”
he says, and relief was welcome. The
members of the syndicate knew the
value of the property they had bought.
Others, including the steel trust, knew
the value. The Tennessee company,
independently, was in a position to
become a competitor of the billion
dollar corporation. Consolidation with
the Republic Steel Company was being
considered, and would have ended the
domination of the steel trust. They
were unwilling to sell. Then the at
tack commenced against bankers,
brokers and individuals concerned in
the syndicate. Credit was threatened.
Pressure was being applied. The story

bears a striking similarity to a chap
ter from the formative period of the
Standard Oil Company. As Mr. Arch
bold said of the independent refiners
of Pennsylvania, the syndicate “re
tired gloriously.” The United States
Steel Corporation saved their lives by
relieving them of the Tennessee stock.
So the highwayman saves a life when
he lowers the muzzle of his gun bar
rel and allows his victim to “retire
gloriously” after giving up his valu
ables. Was the president “cognizant
of all of the details of this transac
tion ? ’ ’ —Boston Herald.
“SENATE NEAR FIZZLE.”
Under the above caption, Walter
Wellman tells in last Thursday’s Chi
cago Record-Herald how President
Roosevelt granted immunity from
prosecution to the steel trust in order
to get certain information relative to
the absorption by that trust of the
Tennessee Coal and Iron Company.
Now, a common one-horse county
editor is not supposed to know much,
so it is not strange that we just can’t
get it through our wool, why the
’Jeffersonian
president wanted to know about the
steel trust’s illegal swallowing of
other corporations badly enough to
enter into an agreement not to prose
cute it —or rather, to not use as evi
dence the only positive proof he could
possibly get —the testimony of the
trust officials and the information con
tained in their own books.
Nor we can’t understand why Mr.
Wellman and the Record-Herald ap
prove of the president’s “sharp prac
tice” in ordering Herbert Knox
Smith, head of the bureau of corpora
tions, to bring all papers relating to
the aforesaid illegal absorption by the
steel trust of other concerns, to the
White House, and locking them in
the president’s private safe in order
“to outwit the Senate committee on
investigation,” which was appointed
to investigate the president’s sanction
of the. steel trust’s unlawful action in
the premises. It is hard for the or
dinary man to discover just what ad
vantage there is in knowing that the
steel trust or any corporation has
violated the anti-trust laws, and then
lock the information up where it can
not 'be gotten at. On the whole, it
looks as though all the noise about
the big stick, and Teddy’s trust-bust
ing talk is nothing more than a big
noise. Let the investigation proceed,
fizzle or no fizzle. —The Better Way.
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS
FOUGHT ITS LAST GREAT
FIGHT.
The election just closed, resulting
in the victory of Taft, and defeat of
Bryan, destroys forever all hope of
Democratic success in the future.
There is no road open to them. If
they try conservatism they can not
hope to compete with the Republican
party, famous under the name of the
safe and sane. If they aspire to radi
calism they will find it difficult to sur
pass the Socialist and Populist.—Polk

THE STEEL TRAP.
The steel trap and other traps,
largely used by rabbit catchers and
game keepers, have been well describ
ed as abominable devices, both as a
means of destruction and as instru
ments of torture most horrible, for
not only do the sharp teeth by which
<the victim is held and lacerated cause
excruciating pain, but this pain is
often prolonged for days and weeks
together, until the keeper or some
passer-by may happen to visit the
spot and put the sufferer out of his
misery. Household pets are also often
caught in these traps. Laws should be
passed forbidding the use of such
cruel and criminal contrivances. —Our
Dumb Animals.
ONLY FOOLING US.
The row in congress over the presi
dent’s message is a little at variance
with consistency. Our lawmakers, as
a general thing, are not more ( godly
than they should be. If we had as
good legislators as an intelligent band
of monkeys would have a right to ex
pect we would have had a let-up on
the panic that has held the country
in its grasp for more than a year, be
fore now, and less businesses would
have gone to the wall. We would have
had fewer orphans for our good peo
ple to have been taking up collections
for. The large cities’ bread lines
would not have been altogether so
long. However, Roosevelt’s policy
does not indicate that he has any care
for anything save T. R. and family.
If the people could get their consent
to change horses at least we couldn’t
be hurt. The devil in hell couldn’t
give us much worse laws than some
we have. We grow criminals and
paupers by law and tax the people to
imprison and maintain them. It is so
strange that we can’t understand that
if we plant a tree it is likely to bear
fruit. Why should we be surprised
at a condition that we have created?
The fuss between Teddy and congress
is only a sham battle, to make fools
of the voters, so that the godless
creatures who engineer the legislation
may proceed undisturbed or unno
ticed, while the common herd, viewing
the fight, will not know what’s going
on.—’lnter-State Herald.
REGISTER YOUR LETTERS.
If you send money in a letter to us,
register it. There have been so many
cases of robbery of the mails by post
office employes lately that we can not
be responsible for loss of money sent
to us in an unregistered letter. It is
best to send money orders or checks.

of Africa offer equal to chasing the
