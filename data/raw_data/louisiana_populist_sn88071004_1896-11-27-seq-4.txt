The wife of a phyiclan who lives In
'Washington tells a story of a distant
kinswoman who was her guest daring
the Chrstitan Dndeavor conveanto.
The kinswoman lives in an inland New
England town, and when she came ti
Washington she spent one night of the
journey on board a steamboat It was
the first time she had ever traveled by
water. She reached Washington ex.
tremely fatigued. The doctor's wife re
marked it.
"Yes, rm tired to death," said the
kinswoman. "I don't know as I care
to travel by water again. I read the
card In my stateroom about how to put
the life Ipresorver on and I thought I
understood it, but I guess I didn't,
though. Some way. I couldn't seem to
go to sleep with the thing on."
She Felt Renesured.
"'What we want is to have money get,

said, excitedly, "of every citizen to ext

"John, dear," said his wife, "I'm os
glad to hear yoa say so. I want to ordae
ever so many things at the store, but I
hesitated about doing it, for fear you
wouldn't want to see the money getting
out of your hands into crculation."

e Dwarf elephants are not unakown to

this country, where they seem to de- c

The Shet4and and other ponies are
the pygmies among horses, and in the
early days there was a horse hardly as
large as a fox, if we may believe the
evidence of the rocks which hbve pre
served the remains of various fossil
horses.
A very beautiful pygmy deer group
is found on the Sunda Islands. These
little creatures are not much bigger
than a cat, while the young are beau
tiful little animals, hardly the size of
a smaU rabbit, yet perfect in shape
and form. The ordinary mask deer of
Central Asia is a pygmy in every sense
of the word, and one of the most ats
I tractive of the tribe. To the natural
/ist it is as undeveloped creature. It
is about three feet in length, twenty
inches high at the shoulder, and has~

to it is the pygmy sperm that was dis
coovered on the New Jersey sands afew t
years ago and forwarded as a rare
prise to the National Museum at Wash
tngton. While the real sperm whale
is possibly eighty feet in length, the t'
pygmy speelman is but eight. This f
little creatare has the peanulitar blunt c
head,the toothed jaw of the big sperm. b
but is a very diminutive edition of it, I

1 (f "UNCLE DAVE'S" SCHEME.
, He Enjoyd-a Sieesta WVile Nelghbors
as Die His wdIL
Blaireltow, N. J., .as a clever old
farer, who has eviden y read the
story of how Tom Sawyer cajoled his
friends into wblhewashing the front
tenee for him. Blairstown's man of
n, genius, however, made his friends dig
h tis well gratis. His name to David
Hennion, or "Uncle Dave," as ha is
fb amiliarly known.
A few days ago he decided to sink a
well, and, determining not to have fur
ii the- trouble in obtaining water, made
the well large and deep. He bought a
windmill and then started to excavate.
Ht ie went down and down, although the
jn ob was a slow and tedious one. Final
i ly he struck a splendid stream of water
it and prepared to line the well with
stone. He carried a large quantity of
stone to the well side and dumped it.
The weight of the stones or something
3 else caused the sides of the well to cave
r in.
"Uncle Dave" viewed the collapse
with chagrin and disappointment, for
r It meant much more hard work on his
y part to clear the well again. Finally
he struck an idea and proceeded to car
1 ry it into effect. He obtained his coat
and placed it near the excavation, then
he placed his hat on top of his coat.
9 This done he sought the hay loft of his
barn and secreted himself. The neigh
bore had taken considerable Interest in
the well, and it was not long before
one of them came along to see how the
work was progressing. He saw the
half-filled well and the hat and coat
close by. Believing the walls had
fallen in on him, he rushed to the house
and asked where "Uncle Dave" was.
Mrs. Hennlon had not seen him and a
search of the farm did not bring him
to light The conclusion was he was
buried under the earth and stones in
the well.
The neighbors for a great distance
around were alarmed, and within a
couple of hours twenty men were at
work digging to clear the well and res
cue the body of their neighbor.
By morning they had the well cleared
to the bottom, but found no trace of
"Uncle Dave." The men, when they
found they had nothing for their pains
except a cleared well, went away
weary and startled. When the coast
was clear, "Uncle Dave" emerged from
his hiding place to find his wife sit
ting beside the well hole, dazed and
mystified. She was as much puzzled
as any one. "Uncle Dave'se" first greet
nug to her was: "Golly, Sally, I'm most
starved; get me something to eat; but
didnu't those fellows work hard?"
How Bleyole Tubing Is Made
Solid .raw steel tubes have been
made fo" years for boilers and general
use, but the great demand arose when
the safety type of bicycle came into
vogue, the diamond frame requiring the
use of a greater length of tubing and
necessitating that this should be as
light as possible. There are varlations
in the methods for producing a cold
drawn steel tube, but the principle of
all is practically the same. Only a very
high clas of steel Is suitable for the
purpose, -and that hitherto employed
has been chiefly Swedish charcoal steel,
containing a certain proportion of car
bon. The steel is taken in the form of
a billet "wo feet long and about six
inches in diameter. A hole Is bored
through the center and it s heated, an
nealed and rolled into the form of a
tube about 1% inches in diameter. with
walls of about 10 gauge. This a then
drawn through a die and over a man
drel by means of a draw-oeuch, until
about 800 feet long, beautifully smooth
and bright both within and without.
This is not drawn at once, but In a
number of operations, and between
each of 'bem the metal has to be re
pickled and reannealed to prevent the
crystallisautm to which the drawing
prooues leds to give rise. The frst
drawings of the tube leave it about
three-eighths of an lch thlek, but thilq
gradually decre.see antil a tabe is pro
duced which is of the thickness of stout
writing paper. This is the clam of tube
employed in bleycles and that imparts a
strength and rigidity out of all propor
tiontoita lightness.-Boston Trans~ipt

We have all read of the discovery of

rightly directed. There is comfort in
the knowledge that so u::ny forms of
eickness are not due to any actual dis
ease, but Pimply to a constipatedeondi
tion of the syotem, which the pleasant
family laxative, Syrupof Figs, prompt
ly removes. That is why it is the only
remedy with millionr of families, and i
everywhere esteemedl so highly by all
who value good health. Its beneficial
effects are duo to the fact, that it is the
one remedy which promotes internal
cleanliness, without debilitating the
organs on which it nots. Itis therefore
all important, in order to get its bene
ficial effects, to note when you pur
ehase, thatyou have tLe ' n nine article,
which is manufacturcel 1 y the California
Fig Syrup Co. only, and sold by all rep

If in the enjoyment of good health,
and the system is regular, then laxa
tires or other remedies are not needed.
If affioted with any actual disease, one
may be commendedt to the most akillful
physicians, but if in need: of a laative,
then one should have the 1. "t, and with
the well-informed everywhere, Syrup of
