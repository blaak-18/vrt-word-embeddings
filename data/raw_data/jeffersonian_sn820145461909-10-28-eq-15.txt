should the voter lose these two
months? Who is benefited by it?
You might ask whom does it hurt?
The answer is, it hurts the young
man who has recently come of age,
it hurts the voter who has been neg
lectful and has omitted to register six
months before the election; it may
injure many a poor man who could
not scare up the money to pay his
taxes earlier than that. The tax-col
lector is compelled to close his books
by the first of April; the registrars
are compelled to close theirs by the
first of June, consequently the op
portunity of the voter is narrowed
down to a smaller space than ever
before in the history of this State.
Now, I see that this has been
done by such men as Mr. Boykin
Wright, who by stuffing the ballot
box at the court-house precinct in
the City of Augusta, disfranchised
the nine country counties which
wanted to send me to Congress, I can
not believe that the motive is friend
ly to the country voter. In the same
connection I am compelled to re
member that in the Macon platform,
Mr. Smith and his friends demanded
that each city should have a State
Senator. Such an innovation would,
of course, lessen the power of the
country counties and augment that
of the cities. What have the country
counties done that they should be the
victims of discrimination? Is the
country vote more corrupt than that
of the cities? Is corporation in
fluence stronger in the rural com
munities than it is in the crowded
cities where their employees are so
numerous and where their patron
age of the daily papers is so necessa
sary to the success of journalism?
Has the whiskey ring demonstrated
that it has a greater power to con
trol legislation in the country coun
ties than in the big cities? Have not
recent occurrences shown that it re
quired the vote of the country repre
sentatives to close the barrooms in
Georgia—including the barroom out
of which Mr. Hoke Smith accumu
lated such a considerable portion of
his great fortune?
We must remember in this con
nection, that a blessed political power
is now enjoyed by the smaller coun
try counties. Under our Constitution
it was never meant that the
largest city should have more than
three times the power of the smallest
country county. Who authorized
those politicians to make such a rad
ical change in our system, which
has been in peaceful operation ever
since the new Constitution of 1877?

How dared they propose this reso
lution at a secret meeting of
the executive com’mittee and adopt
it on the vote of a handful of
city politicians like Boykin Wright,
of Augusta; A. L. Miller, of Macon,
and Hoke Smith of Atlanta? Was it
not a most arrogant thing for the
politicians to adopt this change in a
star-chamber meeting without hav
ing said one word to the people
about it?
That was the main reason of my
«•
change of attitude towards Governor
Smith. I had already criticised him
severely for paying'his political debts
at the expense of the taxpayers of
this State by adding two members to
the Railroad Commission, and by
making such changes as increased
the yearly cost of that tribunal sll,-
000, without increasing its useful
ness in the least.
I am a country county man; my
residence is in one of the smaller
counties; my political following is
composed chiefly of country people—
consequently, I could not endure it
tamely and silently when such un
scrupulous tricksters as Boykin
Wright began to tamper with our
election laws with a view to making
the influence of the big cities pre
dominate over the rural population.
I don’t think it is to the interest of
the commonwealth that city influence
should be supreme. Owing to various
circumstances, the cities are more
corrupt than the country counties.
There are thousands of the purest
and noblest men and women in such
cities as Atlanta, Augusta, Savannah
and Macon, but, owing to the inevita
ble consequences of modern commer
cialism, there are portions of every
city that are absolutely leperous and
contaminating. The purchasable vote
is found in larger proportions in At
lanta, or Augusta, or Savannah, or
Macon than in the smaller country
counties. The influence of whisky and
of money, of the job-lash and of the
trade-boycott is infinitely greater in
the crowded centers of population
than it is or ever can be in the agri
cultural districts.
My dear sir, I have no motive ex
cept to serve my country. No office
could tempt me; I have no axe to
grind; am not even seeking to add
a dollar to my moderate competence
—a competence which is only valua
ble in my eyes because it enables me
to help the distressed occasionally,
and to do ray work in the editorial
and literary fields.
Very respectfully,
THOS. E. WATSON.

SOCIALISM, By Thos. E. Watson

THE MYSTERIOUS CASE OF
DREWFORTH
BROTHER BRAND AGAIN.
(Concluded from Page 5.)
at from $4 to sl2 per acre; and in
many cases farm values are the same
that they were twenty and thirty
years ago. If Mr. Brand is willing
to buy on a ten-year plan, and is
willing to offer $6 or $8 per acre,
he can get improved land in nearly
every part of the old States. The
farm often sells for much less than
the improvements are worth. Surely
that is getting the land for nothing,
and you couldn’t ask for cheaper
property.
Where many men compete for the
same land—as in thickly settled, rich
and communities, it is, of course,
different. But anybody -who is not so
particular as to location, can pick
land throughout the country on al
most his own terms. If tenants in
Texas are paying thirty per cent,
rent, it must be those who believe
that, even on those terms, their farms
are more profitable than would be a
self-owned hillside or sandbed here
in old Georgia or in South Caro
lina.
Tenants, with us, do not pay any
thirty per cent. They have the op
tion of working for wages, or of
cropping-on-halves with the landlord
—and the tenant prefers to pay
standing rent.
If he pays part of the crop as rent,
the landlord gets one-fourth. Out
of this he must pay the taxes, the
repairs and the expenses of manage
ment. By the time this is done, the
landlord is in luck when he clears
from eight per cent, to fifteen per cent.
And if he isn’t extremely careful, his
land will run down, and wash away
so badly, under tenant management,
he will, in a few years, have on his
hands much land that no one will
tend. Then he has to come down on
the rent of the whole place; and I
myself know of places that have been
so reduced in this way, that thp rent
does not net five per cent, interest on
the cost of the farm.
How can a city Socialist under
stand the farming question or the
land question? They don’t. Yet our
landless country-people swallow all
the nonsense these city ranters in
dulge in.
Brother Brand argues that a life
tenant who would not make valua
ble, permanent and beautiful im
provements would not make them
were he the owner in fee simple. That
reveals the very general misconcep
tion of human nature which so many
Socialists exhibit.
Brother Brand must be a bachelor.
In every normal man is the desire
for a mate; in every normal couple
is the desire for children; in all nor
mal parents is the pure, ardent de
votion to their offspring. And this
affection embraces the grandchildren
with even greater tenderness. Now,
when a man makes a home, he is not
only seeking a haven that shall be
exclusively his, but he is thinking
about his children, his posterity.
When one constructs a handsome
dwelling, lays out grounds, and im
proves his fields, he does so with the
idea that they are his; and that the
moment he dies, whether next year
or forty years thereafter, those im
provements go to his descendants.
Without that motive, he would do
nothing more for the farm than is
necessary to his present enjoyment.
Life is so uncertain and human self
ishness so great, that nobody would
go to the trouble to erect superior
dwellings, and make extensive and
permanently valuable improvements
on lands which, at his death, next
month, might go to strangers.
As to all men being “created
equal,’ Jefferson did not mean it as
Brother Brand contends. Such men
as General Washington and George
Mason knew that they were superior
men; so did Jefferson. What was
meant was that all men were entitled
to freedom, self-government, to
equality of opportunity and equal
treatment by governing powers. Such
a patrician as Jefferson never meant
to say that a Digger Indian, a Guinea
Negro, a Malay or a Hottentot, was
his equal.
There is no such thing as racial
equality. Each race of the five dif
fers from all the others, and the
Caucasian is the highest of all. The
other four races are not our equal,
and we should not mix our blood
with theirs.
Brother Brand says that he has
only recently become a Socialist.
Sorry he did not wait a little bit
longer before miring in the nasty,
European mess which the foreigners
have imported into this country.
As will be shown in the Jefferson
ian Magazine, Socialism is a system
of philosophy which is at once a new
religion and a new social organiza
tion. Its aim is to establish com
munism, as to property, and free
love, as to sexual relations; it means
to do away with churches, courts,
laws and institutions.
Just wait and see if I don’t prove
what I say. T. E. W.
