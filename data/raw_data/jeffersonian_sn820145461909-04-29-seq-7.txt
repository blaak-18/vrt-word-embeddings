the game if the pot hunters and whole
sale bird-slaughterers would stop in
truding upon the farmers by running
over their crops and shooting in their
pastures among their stock and around
their houses.
I have, and so have my neighbors,
often had to go and stop bird hun
ters from shooting in our pastures
among our stock. A very unpleasant
thing to have to do. There is scarce
ly a boy old enough to handle a gun,
and some of them handle them very
young, but what spends enough money
for guns and ammunition each year,
both white and black, to pay their
tuition for six months in any school,
shooting the little innocent birds. We
need the birds. Most of them are
harmless and useful as insect de
stroyers, and deserve our care and
protection from the merciless gunners.
If the wholesale slaughter of quails
and doves is not stopped in sec
tion of Georgia, they will soon be a
thing of the past.
How can we stop it? Will licens
ing the sportsman do it?
The game wardens of the State
would like very much to have a game
license law for Georgia, and so would
the sporting fraternity. Let us see
how it would work in Georgia. Florida
being mostly a low marshy country,
abounding in a lot of worthless
swampy land and game, and fre
quented by pot hunters from all parts
of the United States, saw the wisdom
of the game license law, not only as a
protection to the game, but as a
source of revenue from this waste land
for the State. In Africa they have a
game license law for the protection of
game in the jungles, as well as to de
rive revenue to run the government.
Such a law, I suppose, is necessary
in a country where the wild animals
are more valuable than the land; but
I can’t see the equity of a law that
forces the farmers to care for the
birds’ nest, nurture and feed them
until they are grown, and then-license
a few sportsmen, who are able to pay
the license, to come out in the fall
and shoot them for him. Absurd.
Under the present game law you
can, by watching close, post against
the merciless bird-slaughterers, but
under a State license the State is their
domain, and the farmers must stand
by and see tlfeir birds shot down and
their crops trod down, without re
course. I believe that the game that
raised on a man’s premises are
just as much his, while they are with
in his boundary, as his fruit or ber
ries, and that no man should have the
right to take them without his per
mission.
The game season should be short
ened; say from December Ist to Feb
ruary Ist of each year. Two months
are enough to loaf , in one year.
And then if the Legislature would
enact the following law, I believe the
game would be protected and the
farmers satisfied.
Make it a misdemeanor for any per
son or persons to enter upon the prem
ises of another with gun and dogs
for the purpose of killing game with
out permission from the owner there
of or the tenant in charge.
Such a law would give every per
son the absolute control of the game
on his premises. The landlord could
contract with his tenants to preserve
the game on his tenure or a certain
part of it, just as he so disposed; and
those who wished to shoot birds would
only have to go to the proper person
or persons and secure the right to
hunt and pay for the privilege, if
charged. Such a law would give the
farmers the right to limit the amount
of birds to be killed on his premises
each year, and thus protect the birds.
The farmers are the best game war
dens to be found. It is wholly in their
power to preserve the birds’ nest or
to destroy them. When the law is
placed in their hands and they shall
have the right to say who shall hunt
on their premises, and the amount to
be paid for the privilege, you will see
the wholesale slaughter of birds
stopped in this section of Georgia.
In place of the iState licensing the
sportsmen to kill the farmers’ birds
let them pay the farmers for the
privilege to hunt on their premises,
and this fee would, to some extent,
compensate the farmers for careing
for the birds’ nest, and stimulate the
farmers and farmers’ boys to take
more pride in raising and careing for
them.
When a boy finds a quail’s nest, he
calls it his quail’s nest and dares any
other boy to molest it without his
consent, and when they are hatched
he calls them his birds, and when they
are grown he calls them his birds, and
you can’t imagine how it hurts his
feelings to see some strangers come in
and shoot them without his consent.
W. I. Dorris.
Ed. Note: Our friend Dorris is
right—the way in which town sports
men and boys “run over” the coun
try land-owners is often outrageous.
But Mr. Dorris must have read the
proposed new game law very hastily if
he failed to see that a remedy is of
fered for that very evil. The written
consent of the farmer must be had be
fore even a licensed hunter can le
gally hunt on Iris land. The land
owner can refuse this written con
sent, or demand a fair price for it.
In selling a permit to hunt, a land
owner could limit the sportsman as
to the number of birds he is to kill.
Mr. Dorris will see, also, by referring
to the proposed game law that it de
mands a shortening of the season,
just as he suggests.
THE KIND OF “CONFIDENCE”
THE SPECIAL INTERESTS
WANT RESTORED.
Winter Haven, Fla., April 4, 1909.
My Dear Watson:
We go to Boston tomorrow (our
summer home) and as soon as we
know just where we shall stay, I will
send for back numbers to the maga
zine and subscribe anew.
I want all your books. I have read
“ Pop” Gospel many years, but no
one has hit the bulls-eye like you,
“Tom.”
That missionary “fraud” is rich
reading. 1 wish you would publish it
in pamphlet form. I want several
copies to give away.
“Confidence is being restored” un
der the new man at the wheel. “Rail
roads are feeling better.”
I saw in the papers that they have
advanced the rates one-half cent a
mile in some States!
The kind of “confidence” wanted is
that the grafters will not be med
dled with by the government while
they rob the people.
Hit ’em hard, Tom.
Respectfully,
Chas. H. Whittier.

A BROTHER EDITOR IN LINE ON
THE MISSION QUESTION.
Union City, Ga., April 8, 1909.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga., '
Dear Sir:We get on our exchange
the Weekly and it is
always read with interest. In last
week’s edition we read your editorial
referring to a preacher who had taken
issue with you on your foreign mis
sion stand. This prompted us to at
once buy a copy of the Jeffersonian
Magazine, and from reading carefully
your strong editorial on foreign mis
sions, we write to express our opinion
of the same, and to state that it meets
our hearty approval.
We hope you will find time occa
sionally to continue your broadside
lire against foreign missions as now
conducted. Too long have we church
members contributed towards educat
ing. clothing, feeding and supplying
with free books, medicines, etc.,
foreigners in other lands, while in the
mountains, rural districts, and in fact
all about us there are thousands in
this country who would eagerly grasp
such opportunity.
Very truly yours,
Wm. F. Parkhurst,..

DEFENSE OF SANITORIUM.
Tarboro, Ga., April 12, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Believing that you are
always willing that the people should
hear both sides of a question, I beg
that you will publish this letter.
Through the mercy of God, there
has been no necessity for my being
put in the iState Sanitarium, and I
am considered by my family and
friends to have a clear, comprehen
sive mind, so perhaps what I will try
to tell in my simple way will have
some weight with the people of Geor
gia.
I have a very near and dear rela
tive in the State Sanitarium, her
affliction being a result of the un
holy Civil war of 1861-5. I visit her
frequently and am treated as a mem
ber of the family of the superinten
dent. I have not gone there as a
spy, but from the first had confidence
in the physicians and nurses. I real
ized it was the noblest calling a man
or woman could follow, far more self
sacrificing, self-obliterating, a Chris
tian life, than to be a missionary to
heathen countries. In the latter case
the missionary may feel a kind of self
glorification in self-sacrifice, but these
noble men and women minister to and
care for the most unfortunate crea
tures on the face of earth, and I have
never heard a rough word or seen an
unkind act by one of the nurses. On
the contrary, they are patient, gentle
and kind to these poor unhappy peo
ple, controlling them in a firm, quiet
manner. I have the greatest admira
tion for these gentle women who have
taken up this noble work. And I am
sure did I know as much about the
men nurses, I would feel the same for
them.
It is not for me to say what causes
insanity in all cases. We all know
that “the sins of the fathers are
visited upon the children, unto the
third and fourth generation,” and
doubtless some of these unfortunate
people are suffering for the sins of
their fathers. But they have to be
taken care of. The State is doing

Headache?
If it does, you should
try Dr. Miles’ Anti-Pain
Pills. Why not do so.
They will relieve the
pain in just a few min
utes. Ask your druggist
There are 45,000 druggists
in the U. S. Ask any of
them. A package of 25
doses costs 25 cents. One
tablet usually stops a
headache. They relieve
pain without leaving any
disagreeable after-effects
—isn’t that what you
want?
"My son Frank Snyder has used
Dr. Miles’ Anti-Tain Pills for a long
time. He never had anything to
help him so much for headache. A
year ago he came home, and I was
down sick with such a dreadful nerv
ous headache. He gave me one of
the Anti-Pain Pills, and after while
I took another and waa entirely re
lieved. I always keep them in the
house now, and gave many away to
others suffering with headache.”

Your druggist sells Dr. Miles’ Antl-
Paln Pills, and we authorize him to
return the price of first package (only)
if it fails to benefit you.
