Sugar is one of the necessaries of
life, but if it was put on the free
list without an adequate bounty be
ing given th.e producer, no greater
howl would go up from any source
than from those Democratic jour
nals in South Louisiana, which are
trying to destroy the influence of
Senator McEnery and read him out
of the party.--Cataboula News,
Dem.
How can the good white citizens
organize independent of party lines,
for the purpose of giving to Louis
iana white supremacy? It would
be a good plan to organize in all
parishes, as they did in New Or
leans. If the good aitizens do not
get together in opposition to this
constitutional convention we may
as well not vote on election day for
the bosses say "we must have the
convention if the ballot-box has to
be stuffed." We can organize and
rid ourselves now, but after that
convention we may not have the
opportunity. A good body of rep
resentative citizens could form a
new constitution far superior to our
present one in many respects, but
no such men could be elected by
bosses.-Grand Cane Beacon, Pop.
The Louisville Times, in noting
the fact that when the negro who
assaulted a negro at Texarkana,
Texas, a few years ago, was burned
at the stake, the victim lighted the
fire, and that the Ohio woman who
suffered the same outrrge, praises
the mob who avenged her, suggests
that the women of the North do
not differ from those of the South
any more than do the mobs.-Daily
States, Dem.
The governor of Alabama should
be held morally and legally respon
sible for any life that may be sacri
ficed in defending the two negro
brutes now in the Huntsville jail.
There is an unwritten law before
which legislative enactments should
be silent. It is that the ravisher
shall be hanged to the nearest tree,
if incontestible evidence of guilt be
at hand, rather than that his life
shall be indefinitely prolonged
through the miserable quirks and
quibbles of the law, and if in con
trovention of this unwvritten statute
one life be taken the official,
whether governor or sheriff, re
sponsible therefor, should be con
victed of and hanged for murder.
-Daily States, Dem.
A surveyor of the Southern Paci
fic.Railroad was here this week and
made a trip up to Arnauville, going
over the surveys that were made
some time ago on both sides of the
bayou. This visit is made for the
road to decide on which side they
'want the right of way which the
several committees will have to ob
tain to secure the extension of this
branch road to Arnauville. We be
lieve that the road will be built
shortly if the people of the upper
part of the parish want it; but if
they create some ridiculous oppo
sition because the road passes on
one side or the other or the stations
are not placed where certain indi
viduals want them for their per
sonal benefit, they will not get the
railroad. The matter of greatest
importance for them is to get the
railr~ad, whether on the east or
west side, and regardless of where
the stations are located. The rail
road people will select the side and
locations thiat will be most advan
tageous to them; and the people
along the line should offer no ob
jection to the right of way it they
want this road.-St. Martinville
Messenger.
The trial and conviction of
Gardes and Girault will have a
salutary effect in the State. It is
about time to enforce the laws, re
gardless of the social or financial
standing of the accused.
The Times-Democrat suggests
the formation of a medal associa
'ton whose mission will be to take
cognizance of all cases of life
saving and award medals to the
degerving ones. Guiding itself by
the light of r4ecent experience, the
medal association should establish
headquarters at Algiers.
Calvin Schwing, of the Iberville
South, is a hot member. Some
one cast certain reflections on the
South's printing contract, and
the following pointed rejoinder ap
peared in the columns of that
paper last Saturday under the sig
nature of Mr. Schwing:
"'As to the intimation that The
South has been a party to a scheme
of robbery,. I denounce the state
ment as an unmitigated, malicious
lie, and the author of the article,
whoever he may be, as an unmit
igated, malicious and contemptible
liar."

The True Remedy.
W. M. Repine, editor Tiskilway,
Ill., "Chief," says: We won't keep
house withodt Dr. King's New Dis
covery for consumption, coughs
and colds. Experimented with
many others, but never got the true
remedy until we used Dr. King's
New Discovery. No other remedy
can take its place in our home, as
in it we have a certain and sure
cure for coughs, colds, whooping
cough, etc." It is idle to experi
ment with other remedies, even if
they are urged on you as just as
good as Dr. King's New Discovery.
They are not as good, because this
remedy has a record of cures and
besides is guaranteed. It never
fails to satisfy. Trial bottles free
at Clegg's drugstore.
