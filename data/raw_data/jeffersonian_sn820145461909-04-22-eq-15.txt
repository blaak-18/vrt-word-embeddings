THE CHEAT OF OVERCAPI
TALIZATION.
(Continued from Page Thirteen.)
There is only one way in which they
could have made these fortunes—that
is, by causing the railroad to issue to
them securities vastly in excess of the
money they put in, and then by charg
ing such rates for transportation as
would majce the artificial securities
valuable. The common stock, cer
tainly, was all water. In 1899, when
the Central Pacific settled its debt to
the government by giving three per
cent notes, it was deemed expedient to
“readjust” its capitalization and its
relationship with the Southern Pa
cific. So holders of $67,275,500 Cen
tral Pacific stock exchanged their
shares for the same amount of South
ern Pacific stock and received in addi
tion a bonus of twenty-five per cent
in four per cent bonds. The old bonds
were exchanged for new securities,
each SI,OOO receiving from $1,050 to
$1,400, according to priority.
The Southern Pacific railroad was
originally a quite modest enterprise.
To build the road from which the
present flourishing system grew, cost,
according to testimony, less than $7,-
000,000, while the syndicate that did
the building issued to itself $40,000,-
000 in various securities. The South
ern Pacific, which is a holding com
pany, at present has over nine thou
sand miles of road. Its funded debt
and preferred stock issue amount to
$44,000 per mile of road —which, in
all human probability, is more than
was ever actually invested in con
structing and equipping the lines. In
addition, it has $197,849,253 common
stock. On this common stock divi
dends are paid at the rate of five per
cent a year. Last year, after meet
ing all expenses and charges, the road
earned more than eight per cent on
this common stock. How could it
possibly do that unless it were charg
ing higher rates for transportation
than would yield a fair return upon
the investment?
Still the Same Old Game.
They say that stock-watering in the
railroad field, though practised with
regrettable vigor in the early days, is
now a thing of the past. But saying
so doesn’t make it so. The process
continues, but, in the main, in some
what subtler forms. The year 1901
was not an early day. Somebody then
bought, in the market, great quantities
of the stock of the Chicago, Burling
ton & Quincy road —at about $125 or
$l3O a share. Presently it was an
nounced that, under the auspices of
Messrs. Hill and Morgan, the Great
Northern and Northern Pacific roads
would jointly buy all the Burlington
stock offered at S2OO a share, payable
in four per cent bonds. Those two
roads did buy $107,000,000 of Bur
lington stock, out of a total of sllO,-
000,000, and issued therefor $214,000,-
000 of four per cent bonds —which
were then sold to investors, who, to
be sure, got but a modest return upon
their money. Say, for the safe of
the argument, that there was no water
whatever in Burlington stock. The
capital invested in it would then show
as receiving eight per cent a year.
Thanks to the Hill-Morgan operation
of converting it into double the
amount in bonds, the capital invested
now actually shows as earning only
four per cent —which helps out argu
ments before the Interstate Commerce
Commission and elsewhere that rail
road rates cap. not possibly be too
high because the capital invested gets
such a small return.
In 1902 the Messrs. Moore and their
friends bought up $70,000,000, in
round numbers, of the stock of the
Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific —
which had paid from two to three and
a half per cent a year in dividends
through the hard times. By the sim
ple devices of a lease and a holding
company,
They converted this $70,000,000 of
Rock Island into
$ 70,000,000 4 per cent Bonds
49,000,000 4 per cent Preferred
Stock
70,000,000 Common Stock
$189,000,000
In short, a capitalization of $70,-
000,000 was converted into a capitali
zation of $189,000,000 out of hand
and without adding a single dollar to
the actual investment in the road it
self.
And this $189,000,000 enters into
Mr. Stickney’s calculation as part of
that poor, starved railroad capital
that gets hardly any return because
rates are so low.
Being criticized in some quarters
for this rank inflation, the Rock
Island people then issued a compara
tive statement proving that, with
$119,000,000 of pure water just added,
the capitalization of their road, per
mile of line, was still decidedly
smaller than that of many other
Western roads —which is quite sig
nificant.
Following this inflation, Rock Is
land brought $29,000,000, ’Frisco com
mon —all water; never paid a divi
dend—and gave in exchange 60 per
cent in bonds and 60 per cent in
stock, or 120 per cent in all. ’Frisco
bought control of Chicago & Eastern
Illinois by issuing certificates at
$250 a share for the common stock
and $l5O for the preferred. Mr.
Morgan obligingly relieved Colonel
John W. Gates of $30,600,000 Louis
ville & Nashville stock and sold it to
Atlantic Coast Line for $10,000,-
000 cash, $35,000,000 in four per cent
bonds, and $5,000,000 in stock, or
$50,000,000, in all. The manner
in which Mr. Harriman trebled the
capitalization of Chicago & Alton has
been extensively explained and com
mented upon of late.
Just here one is reminded of an
other argument on the railroad side
of overcapitalization, put forth by the
Chicago & Northwestern, which may
as well be noticed here. They say
that if there was originally a good
deal of water in railroad securities,
the large sums that have been taken
out of earnings and applied to per
manent improvements have made this
good—so no harm, finally, has been
done. . In the last two years Chicago
& Northwestern, after meeting all ex
penses and charges, including very
liberal appropriations for mainten
ance of track and equipment, has
earned net and clear fifteen per cent
on its total issue of capital stock. But
it has actually paid rather less than
half of this in dividends. The re
mainder it has devoted to extensions
and permanent improvements. In the
last four years, the amount taken out
of earnings folr permanent better
ments, over and above the regular
and liberal appropriations for main
tenance, is $23,321,604. If one goes
back eight years the amount reaches
$50,000,000, or half the total stock
outstanding at the date of the last an-
