All who have tried it,acknowledge its superiority; A
mand where its virtues are know., no ote hesitates
as to what medicine to employ to relieve the dig.
tress and suffering peculiar to pIhonarDy afec
tions. Ctlantr PECTORAL always affords in.

mildervarieties of brolchial disorder, as well as fo
the more formlidable diseases of the lungs. dici
As a safegutard to chihIren, amid the distress. chI

SThis medicine gains friends at every trial, as
