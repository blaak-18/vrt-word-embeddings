The Only Vital Question.
If the Democratic party is not sue
ceasstl this coming Presidential elec
lion it will be because of their own
self. willed fiolishness.
The issue, before the American
people are perfectly plain-so plain
that all attempts to subvert them are
palpable, and easily understood. This
bhug-a-boo finance question is only
intended by the Republicans to de
tract public attention from the vital
qnestions of the hour-whether we
shall continue in power 'the rulers of
the past eight years, who have viola
ted every principle of the government,
or that they be replaced by a consti
tutional party. We admit that the
Democrats of Ohio have gone riving,
insanely mad, like children, over a
question that has no possible bearinug
upon the point at issue, and the Had
icals of that State, as well as of the
entire South, feel correspondingly
elated with the hope. that some such
mania may seize the mind of the
White people here-thereby covering E
up a tangible, living reality, under a t
poor weak abstraction.
If the Bourbon element in New Or- A
leans dare afflict this people with such I
an issue for next year, no punishment
enlhl bi to onrerre ,, . rr... alrr7me.
They should bear in mind that ty- r
ranny can be exercised by friend as I
well as foe, and that retribution will I
come to each, from those who have t
been outraged. Louisiana must be a
sared; must be redeemed, not only E
from the rule of radical politicians, i
but the peoplo must take charge, put
ting back the self-"constituted
monarchs" that are ever ready to per- I
ish--at the rate of ten dpllars a day,
from among them.
The campaign of 1876 in Louisiana,
will be bitter and vital ; upon it hangs
the fate of the whites of the State
the question is Africanization or not;
that ignorance and vice shall rule, and
virtue and intelligence depart. This
is the whole issue in a nut shell, and
no outside abstractions-can, or will
divert the mind of the well-intending
citizen from it. There is no politics in
Louisiana now, nor has there been for
the past eight years, nor will there
be, until that issue is settled, how
ever much, some may desire it. The 1
fight is for race supremacy, and we 1
must be plain spoken about it.
This is to be a State governed by
its native white intelligence, or al
wilderness given over to the howling
rantings of the ignorant 'blacks and
their attendant vultures, the white
skinuned Carpet-baggers and Seali
wags.
Ames, villain as he is, has sounded
the key note-"whites or blacks must r
rule." That's the point, and no'
amount of "swash buckling," licking,
maudliog slobbering, can cover it up. 1
We fight corruption, Soutlh, combin- I
ed with stnlupidity-North, tlhe fight is
against educated rascality. We fight I
the blundeliug highiwayman, thliat in
open day, pistol in hand, demands a
"stand and deliver I"-they, the learn
ed doctors of the trade, who with fin,
isheld tools, enter, take and depart.
We desire to see all the Conserva
tive Journals in Louisiana come oat
plainly on this matter-many of them
have been "slurring around", and
"comnplementing" enough to make the I
white people disgusted, and moreover,
we want to see peple '"cut," socially,
such pinks of thievery and outrage as
perambunlnte the public streets of our
cities, towns and villages. What
good, in God', iname, comes from as
sociation with theem? Have we not
respectable men of onr own class to
associate with, without hunting up
these miscreants -
Uome down. to the "pan rock" and

The contest in Ohio was purely lo
cal, nothing national Idepended upon
its results, and no one should be dis
couraged thereat.
The republicans of that State were
as emphatic as the I)emocrats, in de
nonncing Grant's Southern policy,
and the people of LEuisians should
go on with renewed efforts to seuenre
their own liberty.
In Pennsylvania, the endeavors of
the Republicans to, drag in the cur
rency issue and make it a leading
feature of the political contest, haa
proven a signal failure, They wjil be
beaten upon the open question of the
frands, peculation and corruptability
of their party. Upon that ground
must they stand. We admit, how
ever, that the failure of the Cincinnat- I
ti Enquirer's wild, visionary scheme, I
whicfeh is Pendleton's pet hobby, will
injure us to somle extent, but will not
impair our certain success.

The New Orleans 7imes, of Octo
ber 6th, is in error with regard to the
reticence of the people upon the cur
rency questions They do not, nor
will not regard that as the vital issue.
It is only a small part of the complex
object.
There is much "ulterior object,"
great "eventual beeefit" in view,
which imperatively requires the "citi- I
zen of even ordinary wisdom to en
gage in the struggle." There has
been entirely too much of this curren
cy chaff in our city journals of late,
and our country friends are not over
pleased thereat.
We are sorry to ib our ,friend, the
Times, seemingly engaged in assist- .
ing Packard, Kellogg and their hosts
in diverting the mipd of the people
of Louisiana from tle vital point at
issue now, and whichl will be at is- 1
sue next year. Or~ntism-with its
attendent parts, radical-negro gov
ernment, is of more danger to us, as a
people, than all the inflationists from
iHalifax to Connaught. The enurren
cv and tariff questions will be regn
lated by events-when there is gold
enough in the Treasury of the United
States, specie payments will be re
sumed. This consumation certainly
cannot be reached without that con
tingent; and free trade doctrine will
nsurp the place of' the present pro
tective tariff system at the pro-1
per time, or when a majority of
thle people turn foed enough, as in
the present instanrce, to exchlainge
substance for shaddow, to be lead off
with such buncome trash as the Ohio
Democrats have gone crazy over, and
forget in a struggle' for liberty and
self-government, allissnes save that of
the "rations" during the war. -
We beg the Times, an able paper,
and doing good work for the people,
not to"stir up" that question again.
Let it rest, as it certainly will never
enter into politio# here aext year.
Besides, we have some men who, if
you should get talking on enurrency,
are the biggest "starters" you ever
heard, and some one will be "green
backed" or "gilded" to death before
the winter is out. At present theire
isan "unaccountable reticenee" among
pocket porte-monnaies up this way,
as we have not seend one "open" in
so'in time, althoughi weV ltrve dinned
the curreney question in the ears of
the autocrats (who owe us) for many
days, and have expressed a willing
anxiety to take o'uvsi "hard or soft."
Go softly friend 'llme,, during these
hard days, let us "rather bear those
ills wte have, thrian fly to others."

The robber has entered the citadel I
of Louisiana; has been caught in the
acnet of plundering It of the choicest I
treasures and desires to discuss the i
propriety of taking them off in the

murderer pardoned-the robber re
leased and all will be lovely-all t

The platform of the Republican
party, adopted at Baton Rouge in Ti
1872, is, perhaps, in all respects, as th
a- good as that recently enunciatad, and
it moreover pledged your party to
in carry out certain refqral measures
whichm. Jf 1872 were, mndbnow are im
'r peratively essential "to the end of en
h, srur pree, good ordera a stable py

T Rpublican party has pmisse- be
ks ed plitcal power in Lou baolmce of
), Iherefire respnelbb' .t all n
' acts rn commission and .m.iom i
ag that date, and has made no effarts to
id redeem its pledges given in 1872,
If. with the exception, if exception it be,
of the funding act. W1
T The people of Lonisiana, if I judge a
x- corretly, are not se the partisan
ed adhereits: to any politial party. The ei
absolute necessity for the establish
meat ofa repestable State govern
ir oeat amd their earnest desire for
re peace and prosperity willt iduee them is
ins to accept aid froms and to act with all
air men and any party practically at.
tempting to realize that desire. Such di
attempts, however, must be shown by
er acts and not alone by declarations, nI
hat glittering with generalities. Will the sl
0, Republican party prove its faith by Its b
wort ?
BW To illustrate the idea more clearly : •
tlh- The Legislature will assemble in Jan- a
me nary nst, the Senate bet. Repub.
lican, the House Consepvs . Sup
e- pose the seate originateº ad passes
a number of billa-sme repealing
pa- existing laws, unjust and iiuitoeus,
tol others exacting beneficial mehsures- N
ºp, which are cocarred in by the. Hone,
er appro,ved by theim Gvenor and tihus
become laws.
for The Republican party weud a n
Sy :questionably be entitled to elatim and I
in would receive theim greater portio of
the credit due for tme passage of nch
measures, and if the State were thas
[otin efifect redeemed, the people in their '
on great joy would feel greatful to those ti
od to whom they would th'.be so mueclh
Sindebted, and waving all questions
of the past, would hopefully press on
ward to the glorious future awaiting
. Louisana.
S If the Republleab party intends to
nta carry into effect the prinmples an
op- nounced in the deelaration of its lead
er. ers, will, at the next session of the
me. General .Assealy, aid in carrying i
our through and thmosseeure, as they an
the dobtlEdlyt esi demshipasmsae t all
measures looking to reform. Among
other thigs, existing laws relative to
hi election, revenue and printing should
be repealed, and laws passed edbo
abs dying provisions as to those matters
all in aeeordanee with tile prinipe of r
80 free goverment.
