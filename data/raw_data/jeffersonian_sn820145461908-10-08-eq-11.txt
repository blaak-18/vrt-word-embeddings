Why <
Suffer?
If you suffer pain from
any cause, Dr. Miles’ Anti-
Pain Pills will relieve it
—and leave no bad after
effects. That’s the impor
tant thing.. Neither do
they create a habit. More
often the attacks become
less frequent, or disappear
altogether. Dr. Miles’
Anti-Pain Pills have no
other effect except to re
lieve pain and quiet nerv
ous irritation.
“We are never without Dr. Mlles’
Anti-Pain Pills. My husband and
son, aged 15 were always subject to
sick headache until we begaji using
these Pills, and they have broken
them up entirely. Don’t think they
have had to use them for six months.
I recommend them to every one. A
few weeks ago I heard an old lady
friend was sick. I went to see her.
She was down with LaGrippe, and
nearly crazy with awful backache.
I gave her one of the Anti-Pain Pill*
and left another for her to take In
a short time. They helped her right
away, and she says she will never be
without them again, winter my
husband was taken with pluerisy on
both sides, and I know he would have
died if it hadn’t been for the Pills.
In less than half an hour he was
sweating, and went to bed and slept.”

HAYTI 'DTSC'RTST'D
V ithout any pretensions to being in
any way exhaustive or historical, the
following brief account of the con
ditions of existence in Hayti may be
of general interest in view of the
prominence of that republic at this
moment. Although the experiences
gained were accumulated some years
ago, there is no reason to doubt their
general appropriateness at the pres
ent time, having in mind the absolutely
retrograde principles which for a cen
tury past have dominated the inter
nal affairs and politics of the coun
try.
The island itself is a beautiful one,
so fertile and prolific that sufficient
sustenance for the natives is obtained
by the merest pretence of cultivation,
and as their ambition does not usual
ly extend beyond a sufficiency of food
and nun, and the wherewithal to bar
ter for or buy the indispensable
sheathknife, it is not to be wondered
that the people are an indolent race.
The climate is delightful, the heat be
ing tempered by regularly (alternating
land and sea breezes, only the short
intervening calm being oppressive and
stifling. When it rains—and the pre
cipitation is tremendous during the
rainy season —it invariably does so
at night, the succeeding dawn ami
day being bright and clear until the
clouds gather on the hilltops at sun
set.
Port-au-Prince has a population es
timated at about 7.000 or 8,000. It
is delightfully situated upon the
banks of a handsome and safe har
bor, land behind it the hills rise by
degrees to a considerable height, the
hillsides being covered by a dense
vegetation in which a species of aca
cia predominates. The town itself
was originally laid out in a scientific
manner on square lines, the streets
being spacious and either parallel to
the water front or leading up town at
right angles. The harbor has become
largely silted up with the rubbish
from the town, and is also encum
bered with ancient wreckage, so that
much care needs be observed in fol
lowing the available deep water chan
nels. Cargo and passengers are con
veyed to and from the shipping by
flats or lighters, there being no wharf
age accommodation.
The town is chiefly built of wood,
and is constantly devastated by fire,
which as often as not is of incendiary
origin. Stores are often built upon
professed fireproof principles, with
iron doors and shutters, hut owing
to the heat and dryness, and the in
flammability of the neighboring struc
tures, they generally go with the rest.
Tn the periods of calm between the
revolutions it is a recognized indus
try to start a fire with a view to pil
lage. With such great disadvantages
there is naturally little inducement to
go in for superior architecture, and it
has become a proverb that all the
best buildings are built by insurance
companies. The sidewalks beneath
the projecting upper stories of the
houses are often paved by the owners
of the houses, but ias each uses his
own discretion as to material, etc., the
result is anything but uniform.
"Glje
The ruling line in the local politics
is one of color, ny very superficial
observer can quickly note the friction
which exists between the blacks and
the mulattoes. The blacks (or Con
servatives), who occupy the country
districts, and the mulattoes (Liberals)
hate each other cordially and un
swervingly, and in times of stress are
ready to sink any private animosities
for their joint cause. Eiach party
would gladly wipe out the other and
make a clean sweep, but as this is
not practicable they do their best as
opportunity offers in time of insurrec
tion. The mulattoes are undoubted
ly more enlightened than their black
brethren, but practical experience of
living under both styles of govern
ment goes to show that there is no ad
vantage in either, both forms being
equally corrupt. Should by any
chance some well-meaning person be
come prominent through leanings to
ward real reform of any kind he is
quickly wiped out.
As regards the religious aspect of
the community, it is nominally Roman
Catholic. As a matter of fact, the
god of the Haytian is Luck, and noth
ing else. Voodooism (phonetic) is
the secret influence which sways the
superstitions native, no matter wheth
er he goes to church pro forma or not.
The priest of Voodoo is called the
Papa-loi, and there is little doubt that
innumerable crimes are committed
with his connivance, and even his act
ive help. The rites of Voodoo have
three grades. The first consists of
cutting the throat of a cock, which is
then placed into a hollow in the
ground, together with various fruits
and vegtables, and dances and incan
tations are performed round it. The
second, which is of deeper signifi
cance and greater elaboration, calls
for the sacrifice of a goat. The third,
which is only rarely performed, is a
most horrible affair, the victim being
a “goat without horns,’’ a human be
ing in fact, and usually a child. Tn
this case it is said that the living
sacrifice is placed in the hole with the
vegetables and fruit, and the assem
bled company dance and perform
their incantations until it dies. Fi
nally, the body is cooked and eaten
amid the most appalling scenes of
drunkenness, debauchery and hor
ror. It is a fact, although most
strenuously denied by the respecta
ble portion of the people, that these
barbarousxand odious superstitious
rites are on the increase.
Just an instance of what the Euro
pean trader has to put up with: It
was during a revolution, when all the
whites had fled to their consulates.
One merchant —the writer’s brother
—stayed at his business house, wljjch
was duly set on fire at. the back in
hopes of pillage. At the back the
mob could not enter owing to the
fire, but the solitary white man stood
in the front door with a navy re
volver in each hand and defied the
raving crowd until the heat drove him
out. He then stalked alone to the
British consulate through the rabble
and was not molested. They all
know what ia British gunboat would
do if necessary.—London Globe.
