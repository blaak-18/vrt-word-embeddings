O LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE O
A LETTER WHICH EXPLAINS
, ITSELF.
My Dear Sir: —I thank you for
your attention, and I have no doubt
that you are sincere in thinking that
I ought to continue to notice Sol
Tyson. My dear friend, that would
be a mistake. He simply repeats
what he said before, and I would
have to repeat what I have said be
fore, and everybody would get tired
of it. I guess they are tired of it
even now.
I heard Mr. Smith’s speech during
the campaign, made here at Thom
son, and not one word did he say
about diminishing the power of the
country counties, and increasing
that of the cities. I did not read his
Madison speech, nor did I read the
Macon platform until after the row
started. I was in Virginia when it
was adopted, and having no occa
sion to think that the platform would
be different from the agreement
made between Hardwick, Smith and
myself, my curiosity was not arous
ed. Mr. Smith’s Madison speech was
not read by me. It is very seldom
that I read printed speeches.
As a matter of fact, nobody un
derstood what was meant by that
majority vote business until after
the Executive Committee met early
’ in 190 S and formulated the rules
which were to govern the election.
Then, we could all see that the cities
were going to take away from the
country counties that share of
power which they had enjoyed for
thirty-one years, and which the Con
stitution of 187 7 contemplated they
should have.
Georgia is very differently situ
ated from South Carolina and Missis
sippi. Those two States have no
great preponderating cities such as
we have. You could drop either
Charleston or Columbia down in the
middle of Atlanta, and it would al
most take a search warrant to find
it. So with Mississippi,—it has no
• great preponderating cities; but in
Missouri, where they have, you saw
how those new rules worked when
Folk —the people’s man—ran against
Gum Shoe Bill Stone, the corpora
tion man. Folk carried the country
counties, but the cities of St. Louis
and of Kansas City gave Stone such
an overwhelming’ numerical vote that
the country counties were swamped.
The same thing would have happen
ed in Georgia if the Hoke Smith rule
had carried in Georgia.
If I was careless in catching on to
what cards they carried up their
sleeves, it should be remembered
that I did get on to the game in time
to defeat it.
A very complete response to Ty
son’s question would be this ques
tion: “Do you, Mr. Tyson, believe
that the country counties should
have been deprived of their propor
tion of political power, as they
would have been under the new
rules? Is it not best that the small
est county shall continue to have
one-third as much power as Fulton
County, Chatham, Bibb and Rich
mond counties, rather than sink so
low that these big cities counties
would have from twenty to thirty
times as much power as Emanuel,
Johnson, Screven, Bulloch, Jenkins,
etc.?’’ How in the world can a
country editor defend the city politi
cians who were trying to revolution
ize our system and take away what
the Constitution makers thought
was necessary to the soundness,
healthfulness and equilibrium of our
political system,—namely, the wise
distribution of power, partly upon
numbers, and partly upon county or
ganizations?
That my discovery of the true
meaning of the new rules came some
months after Glover had been exe
cuted is not any more strange than
that the rules themselves were formu
lated after Glover was executed. I
couldn’t know theii' real nature until
they were definitely shaped up and
published. That not having been
done until after Glover’s execution,
iny discovery of the scheme that was
on foot, naturally, was after the
Glover tragedy.
Speaking of woman murderers, —
Governor Hoke Smith gave a full
pardon to a man who committed a
crime against a woman that all
right thinking women consider to be
worse than death, and this -white
man who received the benefit of Gov
ernor Smith’s executive clemency
didn’t even have the excuse of being
a single man: he was a married
man. In another case, he gave a
full pardon to a man, a bachelor —
and a young one at that —who had
murdered a husband because the
husband remonstrated with the
young bachelor about the indecency
of his conduct in the sight of the
husband's wife.
Governor Smith was not asked to
“pardon’’ Glover. A commutation of
the death penalty' to life-imprison
ment was the prayer in that case —a
prayer made in person by the agon
ized wife to whom Governor Smith
could give only a few minutes of his
time.
Very truly yours,
THOS. E. WATSON.

A LITTLE NAMESAKE DIES.
Dear Sir: —We are so sad on ac
count of the death of our own dear
little Thos. Watson that we can not
refrain from writing to you about it.
The little fellow died on December
31st, just as the cannons were
“booming’’ for the passing out of the
old year, 1909.
In your Christmas piece in the
December Magazine I was very forci
bly struck by the peculiar fitness to
myself and family of the paragraph
wherein you say, “Would next Christ
mas Eve find all the stockings hung?
Would three merry voices mingle in
the hubbub over the gifts of Santa
Claus, and would three happy little
faces shine as they came running to
you with: ‘See what Santa Claus
brought me?’ ”
“Or upon next Christmas Eve
would you be sitting alone by the
dying fire, racked with a pain that
w’ould never, never lose its power to
torture —because upon this Christ
mas Eve, there were but two?’’
This caused me to think seriously
at the time I first read it, but after
the little one sickened and died I
have thought more and more that
the above was meant by the Allwise
one as a warning to me.
Little did I know then which one
of our three little ones it would be,
Zsl>e Jeffersonian
or that o.ne would be so soon called
away from us.
I am sending subscriptions on an
other sheet.
Believe me your sincere friend
and admirer,
J.'P. OWENS.
P. S. — If you would print Tom
Watson Owens’ picture in the Junior
Jeff Department, I’ll send it.
Lindale, Texas.
Answer.
It is with unspeakable regret and
sympathy that I read of the loss of
your little boy and my namesake.
The Christmas piece to which you
refer fitted facts similar to those out
lined in your own case. Such writ
ing can only come from one’s heart,
and such feelings are inseparable
from actual experience.
Indeed it would give me pleasure
to print the picture of your lost child,
and if you will send it to me, di
rect, will have cut made for the
Junior Jeff. Department.

AN APPEAL FOR HOME MISSIONS.
Dear Mr. Watson: —One of our
trustees, Mr. M. M. Hobbs, devours
all you write in the Jeffersonians,
from -week to week, and believes
every word to be the gospel truth.
Now, I must confess that I can not
quite do that, but I appreciate your
position as a reformer.
I appreciate what you have done
for our school along the line of ad
vertising, and otherwise.
Our good trustee, alongside many
others, has done all that he is able to
do for the school, and just now we
lack about S4OO, having enough
money to barely complete our dormi
tory, and the way the property is
deeded to the school by the church
we can not use the school property
for security without involving the
church. Such a move would be un
wise now.
We have canvassed Dublin, and
still we must look to the “outside”
for about SSOO before W’e can move
further. Dublin has helped in small
amounts from time to time, and has
been liberal in away, but never have
w’e received but S2OO from a distance.
You are a martyr to reform and
know' how to overcome all. Do you
know how’ to battle with poverty and
ignorance? Can you help us out of
our difficulty?
Yours very truly,
EMMA PERRY.
Dublin, Ga., Route 4.
Answer.
This appeal ought to strike every
one of us where we live. Miss Emma
Perry is a noble little Georgia wo
man, w r ho is devoting her life to the
uplift of the poor boys of her own
community. In. Laurens county,
Georgia, she has founded an indus
trial school, in which each lad who
has ambition for education, and a
willingness to work, can hew out his
own preparation for a useful, honor
able career.
While such maniacs as the Editors
of the Christian Herald are begging
people to send money to the mission
aries in Africa to buy up from their
relatives such little nigger orphans
as “Dear Little Dora”, so that these
black children can have the benefit
of support, maintenance and educa
tion in luxurious orphans’ homes,
let us hearken to the cry of the little
children of our own land, the chil
dren of the great white race, upon
which depends the future of Chris
tian civilization.
In the mail immediately preced
ing that W’hich brought me ’Miss
Perry’s letter, I had enclosed to her,
through my friend, C. H. Kittrell, of
Dublin, a check for $25. Now, how
many of my friends will send checks
for $5, $lO, sls, S2O and $25 to this
heroic little sister of ours who is
consecrating her beautiful life to
this magnificent work? Send me
your names, and send the checks
either to hei’ direct, at Dublin, Ga.,
Route 4, or to my friend, C. H. Kit
trell, Dublin *Ga.
Let us raise among ourselves the
comparatively trifling sum which she
needs to make a success of her
school. T. E. W.
HOW THOMAS JEFFERSON STOOD
ON FOREIGN MISSIONS.
So far as I have been able to learn,
your friends everywhere are glad
you side-stepped the learned, but
deeply wounded, Dr. Len G. I often
think of our lamented Sam Jones
when I hear a fellow howl.
Some time ago the Doctor was
preaching on one of his favorite sub
jects—heli. During the discourse he
quoted Booker Washington. Then
complimented Washington as being a
wise man, and said the saying of
Washington should be passed along.
I have often wondered why he could
not prove this most glorious doc
trine by white men and the Bible
without the aid of Booker.
Keep shelling the woods, Mr. Wat
son. Don’t hold up because you hear
that a man is hit. There are others
in this foreign missionary wilderness
that will yet be heard from.
The best religion in the world is
the one that costs a man the least
money. But religion has got high.
No more do we hear of free salva
tion.
/
The best preacher in the world is
the preacher that makes his own liv
ing and preaches “free” for the good
of the world. When a man preaches
to me and I know it means no money
to him I listen. But when I know
one is going to take up a collection,
if he succeeds in converting me, I
reserve my conviction.
The way the necessaries of life are
going up no poor man should give
away anything except to very unfor
tunate people. Every man who is
able should go to work. It will make
it lighter on all.
I never heard of such taxes as the
people are paying this year. There
is the street tax, the road tax, city
taxes, State and county taxes. Then
the preacher wants some. The home
missionary society, the ladies’ aid
society, and the superannuated
