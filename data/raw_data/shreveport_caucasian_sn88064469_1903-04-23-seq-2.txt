FIGHT OF ATTORNEYS
In Piteous Tones the Millionaire De,
dlared That He Is a Rational
Being, bht Doctors Hold
to the Contrary.
Lafayette, I1d., April 17.-There was
a fist fight in the circuit courtroom
Thursday afternoon between Attor
neys Dan Simms, representing Fred
Chase, father of Moses Fowler Chase
and A. L. Kumker, representing Mr.
and Mrs. Chas. Duhme of Cincinnati
who are asking for the possession of
young Chase, the millionaire
The attorneys had met for a con
ference with the judge as to what
should be done with Moses Fowler
Chase pending the pending of the
guardianship case. Kemmler denounc- I
ed the attorneys on the other side and I
also Chase's father, and declared that
Moses Fowler Chase had been broug:ht1
to Irdiana from France by force and t
fraud. c
He had further asserted that the un- d
fortunate young man was put on ex
hibition at the law offices of Chase's at
torney, when former Judge E. P. Ham
mond shouted: "That's an abrupt'
falsehood!"
Attorney Simms jumped up from his
seat and assaulted Kumler. who tried
to ward him off. Simms then landed
a fierce right hand swing on Kumler'i s'
jaw, and followed with a smash witth
his left. Both blows landed, Kumlet tl
protecting himself as best he could. ! ,
The courtroom was crowded and T
lawyers, court officials and spectators! s
sprang toward the combatants and at
draged them apart. The judge fined
Simms $25 for striking the first blow li
and this quieted matters. hi
Simms then apologized and Kumler sj
asked the court to remit the fine, as. he
said, he felt sure that Simms strucki b
in a moment of temper. The court m
remitted the fine and directed that lit
Moses Fowler remain in this court's he
jurisdiction with the understanding gl
that Mr. and Mrs. Duhme, who are his er
aunt and uncle, are not to interfere bh
with him. They have the privilege de

Dr. Lairy said: "I asked the boy it ge:

presided at a private meeting of the
landlords' committee, sent word that
John Redmond, the Irish leader. sug
gested the land conference reconvene
Saturday, after the opinion of the na.
tional convention on the land bill was
known, so both landlords and tenants
may then discuss their mutual objec
tions.
Mr. Redmond will be unable to de
cide on the proposition until aftel
first proceedings, for which a length;
addenda has been provided, consisting
of many proposed amendments to the
details of Secretary Wyndham's pro- 1
posals, the chief movers being William I
O'Brien and Michael Davitt.
The former, while congratulating t
Ireland on the fact that the British a
ministry introduced the bill accepting a
in principle, after centuries of strug
gle, that land should be restored to the
people of Ireland, will urge the dele
gates to press an amendment enlarg
ing the financial scope of the bill.
Mr. O'Brien, however, will ask the a
convention to trust to parliamentary v
power the responsibility of eventually 0
dealing in committee with amend
ments. c
It is learned by a correspondent of p
the Associated Press that Lord Dun- h
raven is of the opinion that some p
amendments in the Nationalist pro- ci
gramme can never be accepted by the
government, but some others might be
accepted.
A motion to reject Secretary Wynd
ham's Irish land bill as not meriting
support was defeated by an overwhelm
ing majority. This insures conference w
approving bill in principle. g

the crop. But this trusting to the un
certainties of the weather did not pay,
andi about 18903 it was found nec.tssary
to resort to irrigation, which really
marks the beginning of te rice in
dustry in this state in itsoresent form
and vast proIportions.
In the old days rice was grown in
the Texas marshes, as 0 still is in
Georgia and the t':trolin:s, the seed he
ing planted 1 Inonds and ot rassis a:nd
the water being drawn off s-veral
times during the growing season. I ut
now the method o(f growing rice is en
tirely ditterellt. and co!ntrarv t ,1 ,
idea that most people have the land
suitable for cultivation is not marsh.
but comparatively high and well
drained. The most impIortant factor
is its irrigation, which is done by
means of canals and pumps.
In the first place, companies are or
ganized to build the canals and put in
the pumping mlachinry, and this ne
cessitates an outlay of $50,000 to $300,
000, according to the amount of land
to be irrigated. Rice canals are con
structed by building two parallel levees
over the prairie, 100 feet apart an(l
varying from time to time eight feet in
height.
The levees of the main canal begin
on the banks of some inexhaustible
stream, at which point an immtense
pumping plant Is located.
After preparing the soil l)y plowing
and harrowing, the planting is done In
April and May, and the rice Is allowed
to become six or eight inches, high be
fore the irrigation begins. Then the
pumps are started, and a regulap
stream is sent boiling and fonnilng
through the streets, filling them bank
full. The floodgates to the lateral ca
nals are then opened, and the whole
intersected country is submerged to a
depth of at least three inches and is
kept so flooded for a period of about
seventy days.
At the end of this time the water is
drawn off and harvesting is begun as
soon as the fields dry sufficiently to
permit the harvester to enter, whichli is
from ten to fifteen days. The rice self
binder is identical with other grain lmur
vesters, save that it is stronger and
heavier and has broad wheels to pre
vent cutting into the soft earth. '.le
machinery is necessarily very strong.
as the rice straw is larger and lie
yield of grain greater than wheat ar
other grains.
After standing about twenty days
after shocking the thrashing takes
place, and there is very little differ
ence between the thrashing of rice andi
wheat, and the charges per bushel atne
practically the same. The Pice is sacked
at the machine, the average weight per
sack being 180 pounds, and it is not
unsacked until emptied into t;e bin at
the mill.
In case the ftrmer owns hit own
land he simply rents die water supply
from the irrigating company. payin
therefor at the rate t( two sacks of
rice per acre. If. however, thetrull.-t
does not own his lanl nor wishi.s ito
