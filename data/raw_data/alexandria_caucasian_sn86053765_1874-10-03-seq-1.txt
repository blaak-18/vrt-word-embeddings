for $25,00. ' '
Persons holding numbered coupons liave the ta na chance of winning a prize in
the Lottery, us those who use their tickets for admission to tho Fair.
Tho Directors of the Association in consequence of the impoverished condition of
our people and the general Stringency of the times, find themselves unable to obtain
from the ordinary methods of raising funds—means sufficient aud necessary to place
this institution upon a solid and permanent basis—one that will enable them to
increase its sphere of usefulness and attractiveness to all classes of the public.
To accomplish the following desirable ends: 1st. The extinguishment of all debts
which may now be due by t he Association. 2nd. Tho erection of suitable buildings
fur the Mechanical and Agricnltuaal products exhibited, and for the protection of
stock—the Directors have adopted the foregoing plan, which seems to them the only
feiisibleand practical way of raising the necessary funds. In proposing thisschenie the
Directors do not disguise from themselves the difficulties which must attend its
execution; but reposing their confidence in the worthiness of their aims, they ap
peal to the sympathy and pride of the citizens, especially of this and our sister par
ishes, and to every public spirited Louisianian. to come forward and aid an enter
prise, which seeks only to build up and develop the resources of our beloved State.
The object of the Association is to create a renewed interest among all classes of
our citizens in our coming Fair, and at the same time, by offering largo inducements
to stimulate the sale of its ticket« to au extent that will enable it to realize an
amount adequate to its pressing wants. Tho plan of The Association is to issue 20 -
000 tickets at seventy-five cents a ticket—the price of admission to the Fair with à
coupon attached bearing a number: the said ticket entitling the bolder to one ad
mission to the Fair, the coupon being retained by himself.
On the Inst day nf the Fair, numbers corresponding with the number of tickets
issued, will be placed in a wheel, and all of the prizes in another, when the Grand
Drawing will take place under the supervision of tho following well-known aeu
