Dear Vindicatar :
Spring, like a coy maiden, seems dn

her stern old parent Winter, and to as
sntib tlibstg'ntlo graces 86 winnibug nd
attractive: ith that coquetry attribu
ted to every thing of the fethinine gen

sweet inflnences of the season, and
plunge us into the fiery embraces of
Summer. To' mitigate thh fir reath
which will soon assail'tn, let fts prepare
for the enjoyment of the fruite and vege
tables mantured by its' power And apro
pos to'that 'Kenuicky Slaw" will not be
amiss. The late celebration of the So.
ciety of Iltuai Brith, in Natchitoches,
suggests calling tupon the daughterstif
"Sarah, Rebecca and Leah," to' bring
forth'their eulinary lore. I am told thbt
one sitt4ng.at their well spreawl beards,
is often temptdl to exclaim wiah Felix of

while we are catering to the physical

the heart. Let us throw oiffthe benumb

Pear Vindicator : and
From a short piece in your issue otf h''1
the 21st, I am led to infer that our liad
Iegisature has enacted a law jiranit
ing b tra compensation to the Chair
nman ,bf the ditlerent Committees of
the Ilojisi- ~ind Senate. Now it does "`
appear to Vyoui correspondnt tlhat 'r"
the per diemn and mileage, which the til
nwmn!mers receive by the authority Of of e
the Consttitution, are sufficient salary, I'e i
without Ia resort to the "extra cony- IIl.
lpeinsation dodge." The Democratic Ae
party, in tihe canvass, struggled hard am
to carry the different, proposed am t endin
meats to the Constitutiod, and par- and
ticularly, tile one reducing the mi' .ige put
and per diem of members of the Leg- at
islature. But whep a Democratic lixt

Id In your last iSBle ydti refer to the

Sour citizeus known here as the In

bt finally and fully closed, and' tlrai a
ds, general reconciliation was toe' be ac
of complished. Our best citiitns had
e- educated themselves to the pbtnt of

so- them pure miotives thit prorrited
