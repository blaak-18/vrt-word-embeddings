Summary of Events as They Happen

of these cases will prolong these important
issues for months, perhaps years, and the de
lay has the effect of suspending all opera
tions against the unlawful acts of both these
corporations for an indefinite period.
The death of Justice Brewer may pro
foundly have affected the Supreme Court, but
the stated desire to have a full court consider
these cases should not retard too long mat
ters which should not be left
uncertain.
The Supreme Court IS the
Supreme Court; and therefore
its decisions could not be re
viewed by any higher tribunal,
nor carried there on the pre
text that the Court was crip
pled by the death of one of its
members. “What is the law?
Has it been violated?” Are the
points, it seems, the Supreme
Court must decide, and the fact
that two swollen corporations
are defendants, while of public
importance, is not a thing
which can be presumed to enter
into the consideration of the
Justices. Indeed, the mere
halting’ of the cases because the
parties are great corporations
departs from the rigid line of
impartial justice that should be
preserved. If decided by eight,
instead of nine judges, natural
ly either party against whom
the decision went would always
allege that the incompleteness
of the Court occasioned the ad
verse decision, but this in itself
would unsettle nothing.
Mr. Taft should by all means
hasten his appointment of
Judge Brewer’s successor, and
let these cases be re-heard, if
necessary, and disposed of. As
the matter stands, it looks very
like the harried members of the
Court hailed the death of their
associate as a respite from a
decision which is ticklish to
make. The public would like
to know WHY it is ticklish.
They are not there to consider ’
anything but justice—without reference to its
effect upon “capital” or anything else.

But either the one or the other forgot the cue
and the sacred compact, or got the wires
crossed, or something, for to the horror and
amazement of the standpatters, and the un
holy glee of the insurgents, the reports next
day carried the suave and soothing words of
Taft, as he gently tried to cajole the recalci
trants into the “regular” corrall, while Wick
