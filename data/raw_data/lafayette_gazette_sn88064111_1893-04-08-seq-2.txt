FINIS.
In 189o suit was instituted by
Lehman, Stern & Co., a commey
cial firm in New Orleans, against
Mrs. M. A. Broussard, wife, et al.,
in the District Court in the parish
of Lafayette, involving an amount
of about $4ooo. The legal phases
appeared "of -such a complicated
nature, and was fought so stubborn
ly from its incipiency as to. justly
become a cause celebre.
After over two years of tedious
labor before the District Court, it
went up to the Supreme Court,
which higher court affirmed all the
rulings of the lower court.
And now this celebrated case was
brought to an abrupt close Saturday
last by the plaintiffs moving for a
discontimance,' thereby admitting
that they were in error in their ap
plicaton of the law in the case and.
facts applicable thereto. And thus
suddenly ended a case wherein the
costs of court will approximate' some
$sooo which will be paid by plain
tiff.
The attorneys engaged in behalf
of -Lehman, Stern & Co., were
Mebsrs' Henry Garland Jr., Kenneth
Bailo, L. I. Tansy, and White;
Parlange and Saunders, while Mri.
Broussard :and others were repre
sented by Messrs. Conrad Debail
lon and C. H. Mouton; and al
though pitted against an array of
formidable talent, reputed to be
high in learning, the two attorneys
for Mrs. Broussard were more than
a match for them, as events proved.
The Gazette doffs its hat to the
two gentleman and compliment
them on their victory, and the ad
mirable manner in which they
handled the case.
TO BA TON ROUGE.
The Texas, Louisiana and East
ern railroad is presently engaged in
extending its road from Conroe,
Texas, and it is now built to a point
near the Trinity river, and is being
pushed east, the ultimate end being
Baton Rouge. And from the tenor
of an interview with the treasurer of
the company, and reported in the
Galveston News, we judge work is
progressing right along, and before
many months have lapsed the ob
jective point will be reached.
The building of this road should
possess some interest to the people
of Lafayette, because it brings with
in the reach of the proposed, and
frequently talked of, Louisiana Cen
tral (the road that will eventually
be built between Lafayette and some
point on the Misstssippi river) an
other connecting link.
With the Texas and Paci~c rail
road and its vast number of con
necting lines; the Texas, Iouisiana
and Eastern. railroad and its con
nections; the Anchor line of steam
ers, and the Mississippi Valley
Barge line, any or all of these could
been chained with the LouisianaCen
tral would form part of a truly
grand trunk line covering every.
point, by rail and river, east, west,
north and south. And thus would
be furnished in its amplest meaning,
such competition that would afford
the most aneficial results.
Strtis, *orable to the fullest
development of'our great dormant
resources, are being wafted towards
as from every point of the compass,
and the town and parimh of Lafa
yitte, it is to be hoped, will not mis
take them for will-o'-wisps.
