BITTERS.
Grateful Thonsands proclaim
V inegar B itters the most wonder
ful Invigorant that ever sustained
the sinking system.
No Person can take these Bit
ters according to directions, and re
main long unwell, provided their
bones are not destroyed by mineral
poison or other means, and vital or
gans wasted beyond repair.
Bilious, Remittent, and In
termittent Fevers, which are so
prevalent in the valleys of our great
rivers throughout the United States,
especially those of the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, Arkansas, Red, Colo
rado, Brazos, Rio Grande, Pearl,
Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
° with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarks
bly so during seasons qf unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
• other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon tbeso vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal t» D r . J. W alker's V inegar
B itters , as they will speedily remove
the (lark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
nnd generally restoring the bSlthy func
tions of the diçi iti vo organs.

Scrofula, or King's Evil, White
Swellings, Ulcers, Erysipelas, Swelled

Indolent Inflammations, Mercurial affec
tions, Old Sores, Eruptions of the Skin,
Sore Eyes, etc. In these, as in all other
constitutional Diseases, W alker ' s Y ih -
koa r B ittkrs have shown their great cur
■ ative powers in the most obstinate and
intractable canes.
For Inflammatory and Chronic
Rheumatism, Gout, Bilious, Remit
tent and Intermittent' Fevers, Diseases
of the Blood, Liver, Kidneys and Bladder,
these Bitters havo no equal. Such Dis
eases are caused by Vitiated Blood.
Mechanical Diseases.— Persons
engaged in Paints and Minerals, such as
Plumbers, Type-setters, Gold-beaters and
Miuers, as they advauce in life, are sub
ject to paralysis of the Bowels. To. guard
against this, take a dose of W alkeb's

worms, Scald-head, Soro Eyes, Erysipe
las, Itch, Scurfs, Discolorations of the
Skin, Humors und Diseases of the Skin of
whatever name or nature, are literally
dug up and carried out of the system in a
short time by the use of these Bitters.
Pin, Tape, and other Worms,
lurking in the system of-so many thou
sands, are effectually destroyed and re
moved. No system of medicine, no ver
mifuges, no anthelmintics will free the
system from worms like these Bitters.
ForFenialeComplaints, in young
or old, married or single, at the dawn of
womanhood, orthe turn of life, these Ton
ic Bitters display so decided an influence
that improvement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Yitia#d Blood
whenever you find its impurities bursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores \ cleanse it when you find it ob
structed and sluggish in the veins; cleanse
it when it is foul ; your feelings will tell
you when. Keep the blood pure, and the
ïuAlth of the system will follow.
