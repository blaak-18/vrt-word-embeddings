ports and writings of any character upon the
subject of wrecks, derailments, collisions, de
lays and breakdowns occurring upon said rail
road since Ist of January, 1906, and the causes
of the same, in order that the commission may
judge whether or not travel upon the said road
Is safe and expeditious as the law requires and
demands.
10. That after the defendant has filed its
said answer and the lessees have filed the doc
uments above set forth, complainant prays that
the commission have such hearings, inspec
tions and further investigations as may be
deemed necessary for an ascertainment of
whether or not travel upon the said road is
safe and expeditious according to law.
It seems to me that Mr. Phinizy has done all
that the commission asked of him. His SPE
CIFIC requests are really SPECIFIC charges.
It is now up to the railroad commission to
make the investigation or explain to the peo
ple why they refuse to do so.
A GOOD OFFER. .
The word FREE Strikes most peo
ple as meaning nothing, hence there
are opportunities absolutely free of
fered to people every day which sim
ply goes unnoticed and overlooked by
the masses, simply because they saw
the word “free” attached to the of
fer. As one of the most prominent
men of our country today once said
that he could always tell who were
the most successful, It was those that
took notice. So let us call the read
ers of our paper to the John Foster
Company, of Atlanta, Ga., to their add
which is shown in this paper. Look
for it, they offer to send their catalog
of stoves and ranges free to any one;
their catalog gives you lots of infor
mation and may be the means of sav
ing you dollars on an article of neces
sity. The information which their
catalog gives is worth something. It’s
free; doesn’t cost you anything. So
write to the John Foster Company, of
Atlanta, Ga., for their free stove cata
log.

WEALTH IN COTTON.
American Exports last Year Nearly
$500,000,000.
Washington, Feb. 22. —America’s
pocketbook was enriched by practical
ly $500,000,000 through its exportations
last year of cotton and the products
of that staple, according to a state
ment issued today by the bureau of
statistics of the department of com
merce and labor. The exports of these
products amounted to 28 per cent of
the $1,773,000,000 value of the domes
tic exports.
The following figures show the kind
of cotton products exported last year
and their value: Unmanufactured cot
ton, $413,137,936; manufactures of cot
ton, $42,961,048; cottonseed oil, $13,-
993,431; cottonseed oil cake and meal,
$14,165,268; cottonseed, $245,920; cot
tolene, lardine, etc., chiefly from cot
tonseed, $4,801,000, bringing the total
exports of these products up to $489,-
304,681.
Os the $413,000,000 worth of raw
cotton exports, $173,000,000 went to the
United Kingdom, $109,000,000 to Germ
any, $45,000,000 to France, $31,500,000
to Italy, nearly $7,000,000 to Belgium,
$5,000,000 to Russia and $1,000,000 to
the Netherlands, while to Japan the
exports were valued at over $11,000,-
000 and to Canada $7,333,000. The
figures show a reduction in the exports
of cotton sent to Japan compared with
1905, while to Canada they show a
slight increase.
In quality the records show a falling
oft as compared with 1905, the total
number of pounds shipped in that year
Speaking of the Georgia Railroad, Bowdre
Phinizy has already accomplished something
for which all of us living along the line should
be thankful. He is making the management
get a move on in the way of making repairs.
Many of the bad places have been put in good
order since his original complaint was filed.
If it has the effect all along the line that it has
had here, the EXPERT, which this road was
willing to pay, will have an easy job. We are
not particular about having the road made
better by recommendation of the railroad com
mission, or by the EXPERT’S report —just
so it is put in good condition. Do that before
the INVESTIGATORS have time to INVES
TIGATE, and we will be satisfied. It meets
the same end.

being 4,137,154,935, while for 1906 the
figures were 3,850,229,030. The fall
ing off in quantity, however, was more
than offset by the increase in price
of cotton exports, the increase in val
ue in 1906 exceeding the previous year
by $21,000,000.
Os the cotton manufactures export
ed the bulk went to countries other
than Europe. The value of cotton
cloths exported last year was $32,-
500,000, of which a little over $500,000
went to Europe, $16,750,000 to China,
$5,000,000 to other Asiatic countries,
about $3,000,000 worth to the West In
dian islands exclusive of Porto Rico,
$1,500,000 to Central America and more
than $750,000 to Canada.

But all ob er sudden,
De clouds brake away,
De sun shine pon ’im,
An e elude not ter stay.

An effort was made to launch a Hoke Smith
Presidential boom, but Mr. Smith very mod
estly stopped the same by saying that he de
sired to give Georgia much needed reforms, as
her next Governor. There are reforms need
ed in Georgia, and if the next legislature goes
back on Mr. Smith, he will let the people “at
home” know it. Perhaps a few Statesmen will
be hunting other jobs before two years have
expired.
A good thing that our next legislature can
do is to investigate our public school system.
Public schools should be what the name im
plies, that and nothing less. We pay taxes to
this fund, and we should get, in return, what
we pay for.
The system may work all right in some sec
tions of Georgia, but where it is cheaper to
send to a private school than to the public
school, there is something wrong about ttye
system at that place, and the tax payers are
not getting what they pay for.
