Farmers' Wives. et
Farmers shonid be very indulgent to si
their poor hilard-working wives. Let er
it not be stlpposed thtut their work is iI
light and easy because they do not go 0
out into thle field and work side by "
aide with men. The truth is, thiieir tl
work is often iharder than that of lesn. r
The thlings necessary to be done llholt it
the house are bewildering in nuniber e
and variety, and nothing but the i
plodding patience of a good wilfe
-a true womlan-is equal to perform
aing them. She is elpected to draw
the water, bring in the wood, feed
the hens and turkeys, milk the cows, r
do the entire house-wRk, whichli in- 1
eludes cooking, washing, ironing,
making beds, sweeping, scrubbing, i
mending, sewing, making soap, boil. t
i1mg down sap in the proper tinme of
the year, besides being always ready
to lead a helping hand at turning the
griodstone, raking hay, dropping seed
seorn, weeding the garden, and a score
of other duties which it would be
wearisome to enumerate.-Our Home

The Vicksburg Herald gives good

tai Wiillard, of San eateon Coanty, Cait
fornia, gives a very simple, and, in co
his experience, a very effective safe. uf

full. takes two round pieces of tin, like the 4
tch." bottoti of a fruit can pneihes a hole
in thle centre of each piece, and strings
them on a strong wire, one near each
end. Then hl e stretches the wire from
ent to side to side o( a room and fastens n
Let each end firmly. Anything which is c
ork is h ang upon the wire between the plates -
Nt go of tin is safe from the rats, for if they
de by walk out upon the wire, every time
their they try to mount the circle of tin it
Smt. revolves and they cannot pass over
ot it. Mr. Willard has found the simp;le
nsher contrivanice very useful in saving
tt the meat, grain, etc, and advises all far
wif n mers to try it.

og the Cattle Fond.-Experience teaches
useed s that cattle thrive best on a ix- c
a score ed diet; all hay or all grain will puo
td be dunce less beet than hay alnd grain.
ome The animal structure of the ox also
demands bulk in food as well as rich
iess; the feeding of concentrated
a good food being only profitable so far as
vvelost the animal assimilates it, beyond that
what is simply increasing the mantre heap
at a cost far beyond its value. The
New ox has appro-imately eleven and
one-half pounds of stomach with on
Now ly two and one-balf ponnds of intes
tines to 109 pounds live weight - the
Now sheep has less stomach and more in
testines, giving a smaller percentage
olaes. of digestive apparatus; while the pig
for every 100 pounds of his hive
, Now weight has only one and one-third
pounds of stomach to six pounds of
mont of intestines. A steer would thrieve on
f fbank. a bulk of straw with a httle oil meal,
that would shrink a sheep and starve
r rchill a pig. Pork can be produced from

quites a greater variety of food, and

our friends.
TILE SUN will continue to be the strenuous
advocate of'reform and retrenchment, and of
the, substitution of statesmanship. wisdom, and a
integrity for hollow pretence. imblecilit, and C
fraud in the administration of public affairs. It t,
will contend for the government of the people
by the people and for the people, as opposed to
goevernment by fralds in the ballot Ibox and in
the counting of rotes, enforced by Imilitary t
violence It. will endleavor to supply its read
eis-la bodly now not far from a million of soulsn
-with the most careiful, complete, and truest
worthy acCo'nnta of current events, and will
employ for this purlpose ai nunxeroniA and rare.
fully selected staff of reporters and correspon.
dents. Its repo; ts from Washiengton. especial
ly, will be full, acetrate, and fearless ; and It
will doubtless continue to deserve and enjoyi
the hatred of thbse who thrive by plunderingt
the Treasury or by umsirping what the law dloes
not give them, whlil it will emllavor to uali .

S For the principles by which The World
o will he governedl in its discussion sad
its treatment of the pl:Q';' questions, it will
to suffice ti say that The World, while con
ao servative in politics, desires the colsevs
tion only of what is good and wise in our
public institiionus and no limitations upon
- the right of plivate judgmient and the
aspirations of Reform, save those which
are nilmlosed iby prudence decorum, and
a rational respect for vested rights and
for the honest opinions of all classes and
sects of men. While it has labored for
-the principles and hails the triumph of
the Democratic party as affording use
i practical promise of Reform in our public
adninlstrations, city, state and national,
it will not be blindly devoted to the al.
Den vancement of aniy party or any clique.
It will freely canvass the public conduct,
while it will treat with respect tlepri'
ER vate rights, of Public Men, and it will es*
aninhe fearlessy into the workings of oar
ted national, state and municipal govern'
ins ments,
""i It will inculcate a steadfast relille
uad npon the original principles of our poli
'el- tical system al the only sound basis of all
i is needed imporvenlent therein ; an unfalt'
Fhe ering devotion to the Constitution and
el- the Union, a scrupulous tidelity to the
plirit as well as the letter of our laws,
3ra- and a sleepless vigilance in mnaintaining
iral all the great safegurads of Civil aad
n11 Religious Liberty. It will seek to mit
Hn igate and not to aggravate the evils il.
ews separable trom Party Government in a
ns Free Country; to proiote good and not
ill feeling among our fellow-citzensof all
to creeds and colors, all sections an;d ll
sects; and to advanee both by its p'l
cepts and by its example the reign of
Reason and of Law over prejudice Ind
-passion in all our public action and is

its ability to all men and to all classesof
