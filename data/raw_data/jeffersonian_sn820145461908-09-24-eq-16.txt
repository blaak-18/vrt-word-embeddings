Now is the time for the Populists
of Alabama to get in some good work.
At a meeting of the Executive Com
mitlee held in Birmingham on July
4, the following electoral ticket was
nominated:
Electors for State at large—A. P.
Longshore, of Shelby; I. M. Boswell,
of Geneva.
First District —Webster C. Kyle,
of Monroe.
Second District—William B. Rog
ers. of Wilcox.
Third District: —J. C. Cox, of Ge
neva.
Fourth District —M. N. Ethridge,
of Dallas.
Fifth District —E. A. Phillips, of
Clay.
Sixth District —G. T. Hassell, of
Fayette.
Seventh District —John Yarbrough,
of St. Clair.
Eighth District —J. Z. D. Byers, of
Lawrence county.
Ninth District —W. A. Fountain,
of Perry.
We owe it to the principles for
which we stand —Jeffersonian Democ
racy —to do all in our power to elect
this ticket.’* Though we do not ex
pect to elect them, we can give them
a big vote, and a big vote for these
principles is a mighty big stick over
the heads of the old parties when they
make their platforms and adopt their
policies, so a vote for this ticket will
not be A 4 thrown away” if we do not
elect our man, and we may accom
plish a great amount of good without
having the reins of government di
rectly in our hands.
And let us not only help with our
votes, but do all the 4 ‘missionary
work” we can. Subscribe for the
Jeffersonians and get others to sub
scribe. Get sample copies and dis
tribute them among your neighbors.
-Democratic newspapers in Alabama
are not as friendly to our cause as
they are in other states, and we have
very little opportunity to do educa
tional work or to keep our friends
posted as to what is being done. The
Alabama Populist, published at Sel
ma, Ala., is our official organ, and
all Alabamians should do .something
toward increasing its circulation.
Send for a sample copy. Then sub
scribe and get others interested. It
is absolutely necessary that we keep
in close touch, and we cannot do it
without some medium, so give the
Alabama Populist your support.
We know our principles are right;
we know our candidate for president
is the brainiest and best man in
America; we know we have always
made a clean tight, never surrender
ing one inch of ground—what have
we to be ashamed of?
Let us poll a big vote for Populism.
