Sam Jones’ Grandson Awarded to Grand
mother.
Cartersville, Ga., Jan. 20. —Judge A. W.
Fite has directed that Same Jones Sloan, the
two-year-old grandson of the late Rev. Sam
P. Jones, be given into the custody and ex
clusive control of the grandmother, the widow
-of the late evangelist, until it has reached the
age of 7 years, or until the further orders of
his court.
A large crowd of people remained at the
court house all day during the hearing of the
petition of habeas corpus brought by the
mother for the possession of the baby.
It will be recalled that B. C. Sloan, son-in
law of the great Georgia evangelist, on Janu
ary attempted to carry the child to Penn
sylvania to the home of Mr. Sloan’s mother,
but was arrested at Dallas, Ga., just as he
was attempting to board a train for the East.
He was brought back to this city on a war
rant for abduction.
His wife sued out a writ of habeas corpus
to obtain possession of her child, which had
been taken away by its father. It was upon
this petition that the court entered upon the
hearing today. After the filing of the original
petition, Mrs. Sloan waived her claims in the
proceeding in favor of an intervention, which
was filed by Mrs. Sam Jones, her mother.
A great deal of interest has been mani
fested in the case by this community, and the
case was warmly contested by both sides.
Attorney John T. Norris, of this city, and
Hon. Thomas E. Watson, of Thomson, repre
sented Mrs. Jones, while Judge Thomas W.
Milner and son, of this city, represented Mr.
Sloan. The case was ably managed by both
sides, and a score of affidavits were introduced.
Special interest, however, was centered in
the speech of Hon. Thomas E. Watson, and
he did not disappoint the large crowd that
had gathered to hear it. It was a magnificent
effort, full of logic, law, pathos and common
sense, and at times moved those present to
tears.
The father, B. C. Sloan, is given the right
to see the child at the home of Mrs. Jones,
as well as other privileges in connection there
with incident to such cases. —Tribune-Herald.
