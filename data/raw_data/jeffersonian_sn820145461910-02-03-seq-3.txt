THE MONEY QUESTION
SEE from the papers, that
King Aldrich is now engaged
in preparing a money sys
tem. After forcing his Con-
1®
Mi*
gressional slaves to impose on the
people his robber tariff, he ought to
be satisfied without adding the addi
tional burden of a plutocratic money
system. The references to this sub
ject, I have noticed, have been from
the standpoint of the bankers. I wish
to make a few suggestions in behalf
of the people.
Money is a creature of law, a
representative of value, a medium of
exchange, and a legal tender for
debt. It can be made out of any
material the lawmaking power se
lects; and the idea that it must be
redeemed in anything, is a device of
the bankers. In support of this I
cite the fact that, although the Con
stitution of the United States only
mentions gold and silver, Congress
has made money out of nickel, cop
per and paper; and has made paper
money a legal tender for debt, pub
lic and private. The validity of this
law has been sustained by repeated
decisions of the Supreme Court: and
finally the $346,000,000 of green
backs remaining in circulation were
made irredeemable by Act of Con
gress of May 31, 1878; are now
simply exchangeable for gold; are
as absolute money as gold and sil
ver; and are received by the Gov
ernment on tariff duties the same as
gold.
Paper money is a legal tender for
debt, public and private, redeemable
in nothing, but exchangeable for all
kinds of money; and every variety
of property.
From the major premise just stated,
which can not be questioned,—it fol
lows that Congress should issue all
money, coin and paper, directly to
the people; and not furnish cur
rency to the banks, without interest,
to loan to the people at such rates of
usury as they see fit to exact. And,
still worse, give the banks absolute
control of the currency under the
power, of Reserves, and the other
robber provisions of the National
Banking law; so that they can pro
duce panics at will.
To banks, both National and State,
as parts of the business machinery
of society, I have no objections. As
places of deposit, for sale of ex
change, for loans and discounts, and
all the legitimate function of bank
ing, they are all right. But for Con
gress to furnish the national banks
currency without interest; allow
them to control the volume of the
currency and produce panics and
money famines, as they did in 1893,
and in 1907, is simply legalized rob
bery; and has resulted in the sacri
fice of billions of dollars’ worth of
property to the debtor class.
Money is a circulating medium,
and bears the same relation to the
body politic that the blood does to
the human body. As long as the
blood circulates freely to every part
of the system, there is perfect health;
but if the circulation congests on the
brain, lungs or any other vital or
gans, disease results, and unless re
lieved death is the end. When our
circulating medium congests in the
money centers, financial suffering
and poverty results. Under the sys
tem of Reserves, and other unjust
provisions of the banking law, the
bulk of the money is kept in New
York for speculative purposes; re
sulting in the ruinous panics already
referred to; and which will con
tinue, as long as the present nation
al banking system is tolerated.
Let us briefly analyze this system
of legalized robbery, and explain
some of its rottenness.
Upon what are the national banks
based? The answer is: United
States bonds. Upon what are these
bonds resting that they should be
considered a necessary basis for our
monetary system? Simply on the
credit of the nation, and the labor of
this and succeeding generations. Ex-
actly the same basis that paper
money stands on. If interest bearing
bonds are a safe basis for our finan
cial system, then paper money is bet
ter than bonds, because it rests on
the same basis, with three conclu
sive advantages in its favor. First,
it bears no interest. Second, it is a
medium of exchange, which employs
labor, , stimulates trade and brings
prosperity. Third, it need nqt be re
deemed or paid, as bonds must.
For thirty-five years, I have been
amazed and humiliated that the
American people can not see so sim
ple a thing, and that they do not rise
in sovereign majesty and wipe
out this infernal system of banks and
bonds, and establish a just monetary
system.
Paper money is a legal tender for
debts, public and private, redeemable
in nothing, but exchangeable for all
kinds of money and every variety of
property.
But I am not yet .done with the
bonds. In the very face of the Con
stitution, Congress has villainously
robbed the people by class legisla
tion; and one of the most high
handed outrages is that United
States bonds are exempt from taxa
tion, State and national. If you fail
to pay taxes on your horse or I on
my land, our property is seized and
sold, but the bondholder “neither
toils nor spins.” He pays no taxes.
All he has to do is to clip his cou
pons and collect his usury. But the
privileges of this favored class by no
means stop here. The bondholder,
under the national banking law, can
deposit his bonds in the United
States Treasury, where they are safe
ly kept for him, and the interest
promptly paid. Then, upon the pay
ment of one-fourth of 1 per cent, for
the use of it, the United States issues
and delivers bank currency for a
term of twenty years, for the full
amount of the face of his bonds. And
empowers him or them to organize a
national bank and lend the money
which cost the bank one-fourth of 1
per cent, to you and me at 10 to 12
per cent., or whatever rate of usury
our straitened circumstances enable
the bank to exact. Why should not
other people have the assessed value
of their taxed property furnished
them in money, when the bondhold
ers are getting it on untaxed prop
erty ?
The national banks have the power
under the law to expand or contract
their circulation at pleasure. And
yet there is no proposition better un
derstood than that, the volume of
money in circulation fixes prices. If
there is a large circulation of from
SnO to SBO ner capita, the price of
labor and all kinds of property will
be high, as it was during the Civil
War, and for a few years after. When
the volume of money is large, labor
will be employed, trade stimulated
and prosperity abound, because every
man can get money for his labor or
his property, and does not have to
go to a bank and pay usury. But
when the volume of money is small,
as it now is, values shrink and prices
are low, labor is unemployed, trade
stagnates, and bankruptcy stares the
people in the face. Therefore, there
is no species of dishonesty more
criminal than to change the measure
of values during existing indebted
ness, by reducing the volume of
money in circulation, and lowering
the price of labor and property. The
class legislation of the past forty
years on this line has robbed the
American people of not less than
thirty billions of dollars.
At the last regular session of Con
gress, when Aldrich had his servile
Congressmen to pass his wildcat
emergency bill purely in the interest
of the banks, —Senator Bailey was
the only man in the Senate, who
made a single suggestion in the in
terest of the people. Mr. Bailey did
not go as far as he should have gone;
but did offer an amendment, for the
Government to issue the currency,
and loan it to the banks, instead of
Glje Jeffersonian
letting them have it without interest,
with power to control the volume of
money to suit their own selfish pur
poses.
When Aldrich brings up his pluto
cratic money measure in the next
Congress, I hope that Senator Bailey
will take the position of Thomas Jef
ferson, who said “That treasury
notes based on taxes, were the best
currency that could be issued.” We
certainly had a sufficient tax basis in
the Aldrich tariff. It will raise prob
ably $500,000,000 of revenue; and
the people have not the money to pay
it. The next Congress should pass an
Act to issue a billion of -treasury
notes receivable for all public dues.
They could be paid out on Govern
ment expenses: as our extravagant
Congress is expending about that
much annually. They would go into
circulation and the people would
have the money to pay for the neces
saries of life, at the high prices
caused by the robber tariff. These
treasury notes would be like a weav
er’s shuttle, going in and out; out
one year for Government expenses,
and back into the treasury next year,
under the operation of the robber
tariff. At the same time they would
furnish the people the circulating
medium, which would employ labor,
stimulate trade and business, and
produce general prosperity. And if
the banks wanted any of this money,
they could borrow as other people
do; as they never loan at less than
ten per cent., they could well afford
to pay the United States 5 per cent,
interest on these notes.
Now is the time for the people to
assert their rights, while the bankers
are quarrelling among themselves.
Aldrich and his Eastern gang want a
great central bank, which they could
wholly control and use the peoples’
money for speculation; while the
Western bankers want the present
system continued, so they can have
part of the profits at the expense of
the producing classes. To adopt the
central bank, would be like jumping
out of the frying pan into the fire.
This plutocratic measure was reject
ed by the people, under the lead of
President Jackson three-fourths of a
century ago.
Those were words of prophecy ut
tered by Mr. Pitt, the British states
man. at the time of the formation of
the United States Government, when
he said: “The Americans have
achieved their independence for little
purpose, if they adopt the British
banking system.”
Tn the formation of our Govern
ment, Jefferson was the leading re
presentative of the people, and Ham
ilton of the monopolies. Washing
ton was the balance of power. He
promptly sided with Jefferson in fa
vor of a republican form of govern
ment, but gave wav to Hamilton on
finance. The first national bank
was chartered during Washington’s
administration, recbartered during
Madison’s administration, and, seek
ing a recharter during Jackson’s ad
ministration, was defeated by that
great man of the people. And here
again came words of prophecy. It
was Benton who said: “Jackson had
not killed the bank tigress: that she
was only wounded, and had retreated
to the jungle, whence she would
again return with her cubs.” The
opportune time came in the midst of
the great Civil War, when the life of
the nation was in peril. Then it was
that monopoly seized the nation bv
the throat: then it was that the bank
brood marched out of the Tory jun
gle and planted themselves in the
verv citadel of American liberty.
We are living under a complete
reign of monopoly; and the center of
the plutocratic fortifications is the
National Banking System. Until Con
gress takes from these banks the
power to control the volume of
money in circulation, there will be
no hope of political reform.
Let the American people arise as
one man, and demand control of their
own money, paper as well as coin. Let
By E. L. DOHONEY
us demand of Congress an issue of a
billion of treasury notes.. Aldrich may
let his Congress give- the people half
of that amount, in order to meet the
demands of his robber tariff. These
notes ought to be a full legal tender;
but we will be content with the old
Jeffersonian treasury note, receivable
only for public dues.
There is absolute need of more
money to transact the enormous and
ever-expanding business of the coun
try. So much money has been sent
abroad, that the volume at home is
not sufficient. The United States
have sunk over a billion dollars in
the Philippines, several hundred
millions in Cuba and Porto Rico;
and, first and last, will spend $500,-
000,000 on the Panama Canal. Capi
talists have invested a billion of dol
lars in Mexico, and as much more
elsewhere. The business of the peo
ple absolutely demands more money
at home.
