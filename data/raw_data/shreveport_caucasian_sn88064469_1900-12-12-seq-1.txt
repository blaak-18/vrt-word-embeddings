who had spent many years in India. He
mid that the troop.rs angaged in run
ning him to earth er.e ready to cheer
for him and to tak. him on their shoal
lers and carry him in triumph to the
nearest eamp as the chief of the war In
SBoth Africa. This old soldier had bee
talking with omowrp of the gusrds who
had taken part in etectual hunts after
the wily raider and was convinced that
only a true sportsmanihel spist o fair
play and admhrtla prevailed repect
ing him. No other Boer oommander,he
maintained, hbad eoanmaded in an equal
degre the admiwIon of the 'British
army in South Afoa and that when
war is ended the oeean whom he has
outwitted and baM many times would

The Street Llgtling Question
At the lsst session of the city
rouncil bids for public lights were
ýpeaed and referred to the street
lighting and the franchise commit.
lees, who will report to the ounucll
tomorrow ubgh'. There is an loin.
smce being exerted to have these aLds
rejected so that another proposition
may be submttteu. The city, as an
iudividual, mast :be:fair. Ton city
should not place itself in the position
of being discredited. The question
waich shuuld be determined is plait.:
Have the;two bidders, now under
advisement by,the j.lit coolttese,
complied with all the requiremeuts of
he city ? Are their bidsoexerbitaut,
uand how do they,,oompare with ti e
price of lights furnished in other
cities of the eoaparative ise of
lhbrveportt? t these bidesare within
reasonoule proportions, th u thbe
council should adojt one of tne two.
When bidders bavebsubmitted their
bid-, in good faith and in k, eping
witn requirements, they should re
oelve all ue and laisr considtration.
The saucasisa is oppesed to munici.
pal ownership. but the city can, when
ready, acquire by expropriation the
lightlug plast, gas and electric light,
and operate it to tie beet .dvautaye
but the quetaion is simply, shall the
two bids wubitteld by two dºterent
interests, and to ' fall faith of liar
treatmui be considered, or will these
two bidders be told to come apaii
on , a new propostlon ou weash
others would bave a say ?
