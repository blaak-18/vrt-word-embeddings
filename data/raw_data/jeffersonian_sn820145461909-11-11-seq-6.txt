O LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE O
THE ANDREW JACKSON ROCK.
Dear Sir: —I have been reading
with pleasure and profit your articles
in the Jeffersonian Magazine on
“The Life and Times of Andrew Jack
son.’’ I thought probably you
might be interested in the en
closed clipping from the Times-
Enterprise (Thomasville). The Mic
cosukee Lake is from fifteen to twen
ty miles long and about one mile
wide. At long and rare intervals,
and in a mysterious and unaccounta
ble manner, the lake goes dry. The
water flowing out through a crevice
in the rock in what is called the
lake, which is apparently unfathoma
ble. It will remain dry for a few
weeks or months, and then rapidly
fill, the water returning through the
same channel through which it dis
appeared. And, strange to say, al
most as soon as the lake is refilled,
the fish supply (which seems inex
haustible) is as bountiful as before
it ran dry. This lake went dry twice
during the last half of the eighteenth
century.
Since the days of Andrew Jackson,
there has been a commonly accepted
belief that this lake ran dry while
he was in this immediate section
fighting the Indians, and that he
carved his initials on the rock
in the bottom of the lake, and I’ve
no doubt but ’twas true, for, as you
know, one of his camps was at Fowl
town (now called Attapulgus), in De
catur county, not more than eighteen
or twenty miles from this lake. The
lamonia (a sister lake, so to speak,)
also runs dry occasionally in the same
manner as the Miccosukee. It was
dry about ten years ago.
Yours very truly,
W. A. WALKER.
Cairo, Ga.
What the clipping says:
“The famous Andrew Jackson rock,
which can be seen at the lowest water
in Miccosukee Lake, now rears its
head for some twelve inches out of
the water. Great interest has been
manifested in this rock, and the ques
tion whether the initials of Andrew
Jackson are really imprinted thereon.
“It is stated on good authority that
the initial ‘A’ is plainly to be seen
on the rock now, while it requires
more or less imagination to be cer
tain that the letter ‘J’ is also there.
The rock itself is a most interesting
sight, and the once wide expanse of
water narrowed to a little pool of
half an acre, with its seething mass
of fish, and its shores lined with
great twelve-pound trout is said to be
a sight which will never be forgot
ten.
“The Florida Central Railroad has
been requested by so many people to
run an excursion to Miccosukee in
order that Thomasville people may
see this wonder, that General Pas
senger Agent Acosta has decided to
run an excursion to Miccosukee next
Sunday, October 31st. The train will
leave the Coast Line depot at eight
o’clock and will return to Thomas
ville at 5:30 p. m., allowing five and
one-half hours at the lake.
“It will be in the nature of a picnic,
as lunches must be carried by those
going. Conveyances to the lake can
be obtained at Miccosukee. Full de
tails of the excursion will be adver
tised by the Florida Central Railroad
later in the week.”
NAPOLEON.
Dear Sir: —Every American boy
and girl should read your “Napoleon”
and “Jefferson;” for surely they are
just, precise, truthful, strong, con
vincing—such as we are not accus
tomed to studying.
May I add, that with ten such men
as yourself we could change the pres
ent ruinous system of governmental
abuses. No better portrayer of his
tory and conditions is living today
than you. Very truly,
THEODORE RICE.

HERE’S ONE MORE UNFORTU
NATE WHO HAS NEVER
“HEARD TELL” OF THE
TWO JEFFS.
My Dear Sir: —While in New York
recently, I heard a handsome compli
ment paid you. Byway of explana
tion or introduction, I would say that
through a suggestion made to me
by the Hon. James Bryce, I “discov
ered” a remarkable and almost un
developed field of historical material.
In discussing it with a wealthy col
lector and historical authority on
the subject in hand, he said: “By
the way, you have a Southerner down
there who would make, through his
style of treatment, this matter fairly
burn in the printed page.” He was
referring to you. The statement was
all the more noteworthy, for, a few
minutes later, he showed his North
ern training and reading by launch
ing out in a really violent denuncia
tion of Jefferson Davis.
While the above matter may be
brought to your attention later when
a possible transfer of ownership is
made, I should particularly wish to
talk to you concerning a movement
which should interest every South
erner of patriotism and power in au
thorship or historical culture. The
idea is the conception of a New Eng
lander of youth, enthusiasm and ge
nius; it has been prosperously begun,
and, if continuously successful, will
become a tremendous force in the
final judgments of or in American
History. I thought that should you
in the near future be coming North,
I should like to know of it; so that
T might make arrangements to see
you, if agreeable to you. I believe
you maintain a live interest in po
litical movements and historical lore
and criticism. But recently, I read
a letter from you in the Sun on the
proposed suffrage amendment in the
State of Maryland.
Yours very truly,
MATTHEW PAGE ANDREWS.

AN ILLINOIS JEFFERSONIAN.
Dear Sir: —I wish to ask you a per
tinent question, for your comment.
They say that God helps those who
help themselves. Now if a man and
his whole family work day and night
for three hundred and sixty-four
days, and the man, a voter, goes to
the polls on the three hundred and
sixty-fifth day, and votes all his ac-
3cffersontan
cumulations away on that day, and
he gets into a pinch by so doing, I
• honestly ask your opinion—would it
be a charitable deed to aid such a
man? My candid opinion in the mat
ter is this: If a man thinks more of
his party than of his family, let him
get help from his party when in need
and distress.
We have any amount of voters
here, whose actions indicate that they
are living in the seventeenth century
instead of the twentieth. In this
township we have a beastly majority
of one hundred and seventy Demo
crats —that is, that this majority pre
fers to be robbed by the Democrats,
while at other places the thing is re
versed, and the people prefer to be
robbed by the Republicans. I would
like to know what difference it makes.
I wrote several pieces to our local
papers (Jeffersonian style), but as
such things don’t suit the editors’
views they went into the waste bas
ket. I am like you, punching hor
nets’ nests right along, and trying my
best to extend your circulation of The
Jeffersonians as veritable eye-open
ers. In my opinion, our safety as a
republic lies in the Initiative, Refer
endum and Recall, and anybody who
can not Vote that Trinity is indeed
more than blind.
Yours respectfully,
R. J. LEONARD.

Ed. Comment: You have got it
down about right, Brother Leonard.
In New York, the people have been
plundered unmercifully by Democrat
ic Tammany; in Philadelphia, by the
Republican Durham crowd. Some
how, it is utterly impossible to arouse
our people on the subject. Just so
they are robbed according to custom
or law, it is all right.

FLORIDA FRUIT SHIPPERS.
We wish to call the attention of
the Florida shippers to the house of
Hewitt & Co., 10 East Camden St.,
Baltimore, Md. This firm has had
nineteen years’ experience, and they
are thoroughly reliable. The season
in oranges, grape-fruit and vegeta
bles is just opening, and they have
made improvements in their store
and facilities for the prompt hand
ling of the shipments. As they make
a specialty of Florida products, and
have a large trade on this class of
goods, they offer all shippers the
very best service on the market.
LETTER FROM A MEMBER OF
THE FARMERS’ UNION.
Editor Jeffersonian: — Allow me to
thank you in behalf of the Farmers’
Union and farmers generally for your
article to the spinners in reference
to stopping the mills. It was just
what is needed to strengthen the
weak-kneed brother. I was so pleas
ed I wrote the Farmers’ Union News
commending it to the attention of the
brethren, hoping in this way to reach
many who do not take The Jeffer
sonian.
As old Alliancemen, we shall never
forget The Jeffersonian editor’s mag
nificent fight for us while the great
• bagging trust was doing us up, and
what a great victory he enabled us
to achieve, though he was never a
member of the organization; and
since that day we have never known
The Jeffersonian editor to fail us
when the telling time came.
Many of our Union members got
wiser this fall than their leaders, and
instead of holding their cotton for
fifteen cents, as agreed on, they be
gan selling before they made their
crops anywhere from ten cents up,
thereby losing enough to run the
Farmers’ Union for years and to es
tablish banks in every Cotton State.
Let the organizer begin work at once,
for we believe the time propitious.
Yours truly,
B. F. LEE.
Thomaston, Ga.
SOME QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.
Editor Jeffersonian:- — It is not my
intention to annihilate you at one
fell swoop. In fact, I’m not itching
for a controversy with you at all;
I’m afraid it would result too much
like the jaybirds seance with the hen
hawk: The jay kept after the hawk’s
attention until he got it, and then
repented at leisure; and I’m not anx
ious to do the same stunt. In fact,
I’m writing this with more of an idea
of gaining than giving information.
With no idea of paving the way for
a future loan, I tell you frank
ly that I am with you, heart
and soul, in your fight; not
only against the foreign mission
monster, but all others of your re
forms. And furthermore, notwith
standing the charges brought by sup
posedly intelligent and fair-minded
men io the contrary, I believe you to
be terribly in earnest in your fight
for the common people. Long years
ago, before you ever said a word
against the foreign mission matter,
or before any other person had said
anything against it, I had ceased to
contribute. In fact, 1 quit it just as
soon as I had reached the age to un
derstand what terrible need we have
at home for every cent that we send
to some other country. True, I did
not know, until your articles began
appearing, how this money was spent,
or what good times the heathen en
joyed at our expense. Nevertheless,
I notice that among all those who
laid the lash on you for your foreign
mission doctrine, the Roman Catholic
church has not said a single word, or
if so, it has escaped my attention,
and I have tried to keep up with it.
Hence, it strikes me that this church
is fighting free speech and free
thought somewhat less than the
Protestant churches. I note, too, in
your last week’s issue, your editorial
anent the payment of certain claims
of the Catholic church for property
held in the Philippine Islands. I ad
mit this to be true, yet is it any
worse than the Southern Methodist
Publishing House bill that raised
such a stench some years ago? If so,
in what way? Again, is it not a mat
ter of fact that after the Chinese
Boxer troubles, the Protestant
churches gave Uncle Sam some terri
ble accounts against the Chinese gov
ernment for collection? And did not
these churches charge in these bills,
every item they possessed, whether
the same had been restored to them
or whether it had been in use until
practically worn out, at original cost
of new at one hundred cents in the
dollar, and then arbitrarily added,
