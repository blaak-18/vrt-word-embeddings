A FATAL WRECK.
Another Unfortunate Added to
the Long Li:it or Victints of
t to- Iallroad Accidents:
Passenger train which was due
here Thursday night at z:55 ran
off the track near Franklin. We
was did not learn any of the particulars
'ette of the accident excepting the scald
ing to death of Fireman James
Donolly and the wounding of Engin
ette eer Devoe, who is reported to have
sustained only slight Injuries. The
only fatal result of the wreck is the
of death of the unfortunate fireman.
nes- Several coaches were derailed, but
all the passengers are believed to
'iss, have escaped uninjured.
II. Young Donolly was well-known
in Lafayette and his sad and unex
her pected death was learned with sin
re- cere regret by a number of people
here, who knew him well. He was
an industrious young man, esteemed
ley, by his employers and a favorite
a among the railroal boys. Being of
a jovial nature, kindly disposition,
ro, charitable, and honest, his tragic
er, and untimely end has caused much
on. sorrow among his many friends in
ork Lafayette.
H. T The Ferris Killing.
The coroner's jury in the Ferris
killing has returned a verdict in ac
for cordance with the facts already
ay. published about the case, placing
her the blame on Henry M. Payne.
Mr. James Wilkinson, attorney for
et, the Ferris Family, has laid the case
.nd before the grand jury in New Or
,ok leans. The friends of Mr. Payne
ht. will do all in their power to have s
at the case tried at the scene of the
ess shooting, while the friends of Mr. C
the Ferris will make strenuous efforts to ,
try the case in New Orleans. This t
is a question of law and will be de- f
ar- cided by tle courts. The families
of both parties have plenty of
Los money and a lively fight may be
to expected at the bar of justice. So
An far Payne has succeeded in keeping
ne away from the police and it is "
doubtful if he ever will be captured.
It is said that he is in Honduras,
where Burke and other distinguished i
Americans are in exile.

There will be a masked ball at th
Falk's Opera House on Mardil!H
Gras night. The gentlemen in at
charge of this ball request The
Gazette to state that the best order Cr
will be preserved and that everythingpC
will be secured for the pleasure of p
the guests. No cards have been
sent out, but a general invitation is a
extended to the ladies by the man- pr

Real Estate Agents.
J. S. Martin, a former citizen of M
Kansas, has entered into a copart- li
nership with E. Constanstin of this ne
place and J. O. Bouredier of Breaux rti
Bridge, to deal in real estate and in
Sthey will soon open an office in La- bh
-fayette. The Gazette welcomes Mr. le
Martin and wishes him abundant t
success. A live real estate firm is
much needed in this section and we
have no boubt that Mr. Martin, with Au
the assistance of Messrs. Constan- ish
tin and Bourdier, will be the means chi
of bringing to our parish many lar
home-seakers from other States. ati
Mr. Martin has had wide experience the
in the real estate business and it is
Sindeed fortunate for us that he has
selected this section as a field for
his future labors. mu

In conclusion I beg to repeat, in'betw,

equal force to this general brother- "

It is political in no sense except
so far as the word "pblitical" is a 'nt
synonym of the word "patriottc.'" tiary.
It is ta Lsotherhlisod over whi·_c.h the
genius of philanthropy and 'pat
riotism, of truth and of justice will
imp preside; of philanthropy, because
rl it will succor the disable, help the
needy, strengthen the weak and
cheer the disconsolate; of patriot
ism, because it will cherish the past
glories of the dead Confederacy

will spiration for future service to the
Imp living republic; of truth, because it
rate will seek to gather and preserve as
witness for history the unimpeach
aon able facts which shall doom false

eat of justice, because it will cultivate
of nationa; as well as Southern frater
nity and will condemn.narrow mind
edness and prejudice and passion,
an and cultivate that broader, higher.
ese nobler sentiment, which would write
