Horrors of Tenement Life in the
Cities and How to Improve It
The Soliphone has referred to Tom
Watson as the most “vivid and pic
turesque” writer in the United States.
There is another writer no less re
nowned, but using a different style
of expression, in the person of Arthur
Brisbane, editor of the New York
Journal, a Hearst paper. Mr. Bris
bane is the highest salaried man on
Heart’s pay-roll and receives the
most princely salary of any newspa
per man, perhaps, in the world. In
fact, his salary is very little short of
that of the president of the United
States. Brisbane, it is said, is a So
cialist, though socialistic doctrines do
not receive enough prominence in his
editorial discussions to convict him
of the charge.
In each of the Sunday editions of
the New York Journal and American
he writes an illustrated sermon.
These are always a portrayal of hu
man life in some of its aspects and
their tendency is for the uplift of the
human family. They always point to
a moral, with philosophic precepts,
and are a solace to the weak and op
pressed who read them. He hasn’t
the dynamic force of Watson, but in
simple unvarnished language he
plucks from the domain of human
thought its richest pearls and throws
them at your feet. Last Sunday his
sermon was on “Opportunity”, and
was illustrated with a ragged, barefoot
boy sitting outside the walls of a city
gazing at the glittering spires while
the gate was locked against him. It
was really a* sermon on tenement
life in New York and at the risk of
devoting too much space to an arti
cal that will be perused by less than
one-half of our readers, we are going
to give it below. Those who do read
it will be benefited and those who do
not will neglect an opportunity to be
benefited. It- reads as follows:
“Americans are fond of boasting
that this is the land of opportunity.
It is easy to point to hundreds of
rich and successful men who have
started as poor boys and won their
way up by sheer force of will. The
schools are free; there is little caste,
save that of money.
“Lincoln was a poor boy, misera
bly poor, living in a log cabin in a
half settled country.
“Many of the men of great wealth
of today began as office boys or as
farm hands. Truly, there seems to
be no bar to success. Any one, we
have come to think, may surmount
the barriers that are impassable in
monarchies and become president or
senator or captain of industry.
“Beautiful sentiment that, nobly
patriotic and inspiring! It has
brought more than one struggling
boy out of the ruck of discourage
ment and cheered him to the renewed
efforts that finally led to success. It
has made of America a wonderful na
tion, prosperous beyond the dreams
of its founders, destined for still
more greatness and prosperity.
“The door of opportunity, has been
open to many. It is still open to
many. But there is another side to
the picture.
“Go into the tenement districts of
New York and study the -children
there a little while. Follow them
into their miserable rotting home, for
Obe
which their parents must pay more
than they can afford or go without
any roof at all.
“The halls are black with grime
and dirt. Many of them are so dark
that you must pick your way care
fully through. Look into a two-room
apartment, where six or eight of
those children live with their fathers
and mothers.
“Squatting in a dark corner are
three white-faced babies, round-eyed,
staring straight ahead of them. They
are very silent babies, for tenement
babies- have learned that it doesn’t
pay to cry. The things that other
babies cry for—food and freedom
from pain and things to play with—
do not come to these babies, though
they cry all night for them. They
soon learn that, and become silent,
save when in severe pain.
“Tending the three babies, rang
ing from one year to three years old,
is a hatchet-faced little girl, with
dark circles under her eyes, and a
dirty, ragged dress. She, too, stares
at you without much curiosity. The
privacy of the average American
home does not invade the tenements.
“Inspectors, doctors, policemen,
and neighbors go and come pretty
much as they please. Settlement
workers visit there with good advice
and disinfectants. Nobody takes the
trouble to knock and inquire whether
or not he is welcome.
“The little girl is, for the time
being, the mother of the babies. It
is she who takes them out on the fire
escape to sleep in hot weather, pro
vided the tenement enjoys the rare
luxury of a fire escape.
“The mother is engaged with a lit
tle baby. It is a pale, thin thing,
blinking and wriggling, but she is
very happy with it. That kind of hap
piness is common enough in the tene
ments. It is succeeded soon enough
by anxiety.
“Then there are a couple of little
boys, back home from work of some
kind or from going the rounds look
ing for it. They are thin and surly,
and feel that in their home they have
a right to display the temper whose
exhibition will bring them kicks and
cuffs on the street.
“Next door is a family that has had
scarlet fever and a couple of funer
als. Across the way is a widow who
has just paid for her late husband’s
burial, and sold all her worn-out fur
niture to do it.
“Disease in a place like this is at
home. It goes swiftly from room to
room, from family to family. It
gathers in a fat toll and makes its
way to the next tenement house.
“Now look about that place and
see if you see Opportunity lurking in
any of its corners. Opportunity is
for those who can take it. It is
Chance reduced to a certainty.
“Supposing you told any of those
underfed, underdeveloped children
that with study and thought they
might one day become famous, or
rich, or influential. It would mean
no more to them than if you told
them they might one day be turned
to stone.
“Opportunity may wait outside the

Prevent and
Relieve Headache
“It gives me great pleasure to
be able to refer to Dr. Miles'
Anti-Pain Pills as the best rem
edy we have yet had in our
house for the prevention and
cure of headache. My wife who
has been a constant sufferer for
a number of years with above
complaint joins me in the hope
that they may fall into the hands
of all sufferers.”
JOHN BUSH,
Watervleit, Me.
Used Them Four Years.
“Dr. Miles’ Anti-Pain Pills
are the best I ever tried for the
relief of headache. I have used
them for nearly four years and
they never fail to give me relief.
I have tried many other
edies, but have never found any
better.”
JOSEPH FRANKOWICK,
854 Trombly Av., Detroit, Mich.
There is no remedy that will
more quickly relieve any form
of headache than
Dr. Miles’ Anti-Pain Pills.
The best feature of this re
markable remedy is the fact that
it does not derange the stomach
or leave any disagreeable after
effects.
Druggists everywhere sell them. If
first package fails to benefit, your drug
gist will return your money.
