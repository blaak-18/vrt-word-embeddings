In Unity There Is Strength
Monticello, Ga.,
Hon. Thos. E. Watson,
My dear sir and friend: —Call all
the reform forces together, when you
think the time is ripe; give a pressing
invitation to every true reformer of
every tribe and stripe. We need
strength, the unity of all the reform
forces to light the corrupt money
power. We can do nothing divided, in
union there is strength. Unite on
as much of the Omaha platform as
possible, especially the vital planks.
Even change the name if necessary to
unite the forces. Select a name that
is least offensive to all true reformers.
The names Freesoiler, Abolitionists,
Black Republicans, etc., got to be a
stench in the nostrils of a large por
tion of the people before the war.
The name Republican and Radical is
a stench in the nostrils of a majority
of the people and to their children
to this day, who fought the party,
that was in power during the war and
that forced reconstruction, carpet bag
and scalawag rule, and attempted to
force social equality between the
black semi-barbarian negro and the
white civilized Caucasians of the
South, their former master.
And now, as the Democratic party
has allied itself with that party, and
have become like the Siamese twins,
virtually one and the same, and
solids with the Republican party for
plunder, graft, plutocry, Hamilton
ianism, corporation greed and for any
CHEAPER LIVING THE ISSUE.
A Chicago correspondent compares
the jobbing prices of some articles
with those of a year, for the purpose
of showing that the rise is not con
fined to wheat or to meats, but that
there is a bull market in all food sup
plies. We give his table of increases:
1909. 1908.
Potatoes, per bushel .... $1.15 $ .85
Cabbage, per crate 3.25 2.00
Carrots, per sack 1.00 .80
Parsnips, per sack 1.25 1.00
Pie Plant, per box 1.75 1.15
Spinach, per bushel .50
Apples, per barrel 6.00 3.00
Grape fruit, per box .... 3.75 3.50
And yet the Aldrich-Payne revisers
are attempting to levy duties on neces
saries so that an income tax will not
be levied.
The people prefer an income tax to
duties on necessaries. They prefer an
income tax to an issue of bonds. The
issue is a plain one. The people de-

ISfye Jeffersonian
and everything that tends to centra
lize the government, to rob the masses
and favor the classes, making the
oppressed poor, poorer, and the rich,
richer, every day, the name Demo
crat is fast becoming a stench in the
nostrils of the masses. As to the
name Populist, I glory in it, and what
the party stands for, and I imagine
no true Populist is ashamed of the
name. The name was well chosen
and is all right, but, there are many
who have never identified themselves
with the party, who are reformers at
heart, who have become prejudiced
against the name, and some who have
hated the principles of the party have
taught their children to detest the
name. Many, who believe in Popu
list principles, can’t stand the name,
for, being a weak party, it has been
a much abused party, ridiculed and
maligned, though its platform is the
purest and the best. However, I am
not ashamed of the name, and will
help fight its battles to the last ditch
to maintain its principle, under its
name, if necessary. However, let all
the reform forces get together, name
the party whatever they please. How
would the name The Jeffersonian
party, or the Reform party, suit? All
true r reformers are proud of these
names, and what they stand for. Then
why should either of them be ob
jectionable ?
Yours to the finish,
Jno. L. G. Woods.
mand a decrease in the cost of living.
President Taft is pledged to a revision
that will bring to the average family
cheaper living. This is the real issue,
and this issue is summed up in an in
come tax as against high duties on the
one hand or an issue of bonds on the
other.
This issue will not “down.” It is
to be squarely argued and voted on in
the Senate and the people will then
know what the administration and the
republican party prefer.—Birmingham

“I hope you were a good little boy
while at your aunt’s and didn’t tell
any stories,” said his mother.
“Only the one you put me up to,
ma,” replied her young hopeful.
“Why, what do you mean, child?”
“When she asked me if I’d like to
have a second piece of cake I said,
'No, thank you; I’ve had enough.’ ”
