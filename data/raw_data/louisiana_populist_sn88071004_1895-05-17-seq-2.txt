FRIDAY, MAY 17, 1S95.
The banks seem to be loosening
their grip to get a better hold- 1
fasten the gold standard and bank
currency on the people.
The Great West says that "Dem
ocracy is the ashes of dead hopes-
slain at lhe ballot-box by fraud."
That's about it, Doctor.
The Repu'ilicans can laugh at
the demise of the Democratic per
ty, but it's like a man grinning at
his own funeral--their turn next.
All wrong-doers hate those who
expose them--hence the Popu!ists
are the best hated people Im ex
istence.
It was bad enough to steal the
il .r pIank of our platft rm, but
Se attempt to steal the whole par
tf is outrageous.
CAeveland and the fifty-third con
gre killed the Democratic party
sad the bosses are now cutting It
up into pieces.
The "sound currency" which we
are now hearing so much trlk about
will consist in gold and bank notes
based upon interest-bearing bonds.
The balks will control the cur
rency.
When a poor man refuses to pay
his taxes the Sheriff tukes his last
sow or ar and sells them. When

go to th Supreme Court, and it

Natchltoches is a city ot nearly
000 inhabitants, backed up and
urrounded by a parish with an as
esased valuation of property of
ver $3,000,000, containing a varie
y and productiveness of soil and
ther natural advantages that can
iot be surpassed in the 8tate.
Our city and parish have made
everal efforts of late years that
would indicate a progressive spirit
imong our citizens. Only a year
ago did our city and parish com
,lete a magnificent iron bridge
across Cane river at this place, at
t cost of $15,.00, and open it to
he convenience of public travel.
lhis bridge was intended to accon,
modate the trade corning to our
city tromn all that large and pros
perons valley between Cane and
tied rivers, and from the east in
geneeral, as well as the convenience
of the traveling public to and from
the city.
But srter all this immense out
lay, -rhiat is our astonishment to
find t!ie chief public road leading
to and from this bridge, blockaded
within a mile and a half of town,
and that too by an action of the
same Police Jury who deserve so
much credit for their works ot pub
lic enterprise.
In order, we suppose, to accom
modate some friend to a calf pas
ture of about 3 acres, they have
allowed him to throw a wire fence
across the old well-beaten track of
the St. Maurice road, (the first di
vision of the Natchitoches and
Monroe and Natchitoches and Bar
risonburg road).
This fence sends the road about
300 yards farther, down a little bay
on, and turns it back in a "V" di
rection to cross said bayou in a
narrow lane, on a ford that is sim
ply impassable. The mud and
slush has been worked up until it
is axle-deep to vehicles, and right
aler a heavy rain when soft, does
no more harm than rain whatever
"hlinen" parties may wear that way,
cover the vehicles and teams with
the slime, and give teams a "tight"
pull, but when a little stiffer, it
locks the wheels of vehicles in a
tenacious embrace and refuses to
"deliver" to ordinary means. The
people living near by have been
annoyed no little by travelers and
"freighters" who have had their
teams and loads stuck fast in this
modern "slough of despond."
Last Monday eveninag we had a
buggy with a very light load to
stick fast in this quagmire, and in
his vain efforts to pull out, our
borse "shucked" himself of a heavy
new set of harness, breaking it to
pieces. And but tor the kindness
of old hir. Ford, whom we foumd a
halt mile away in his Aeld, we
should have been compelled to
shoulder our luggage and walk to
town with a couple of mall ciail
tlren following; and it took Mr.
lord's big mule, a couple of kog
chains, and both of us to pull the
empty buggy oaut of the bog.
Urssing our big expenalve bridge
after esuch expgereses on the pulb
lie r.ad leasding up to it, reminded
one of the goldea gate that i sald
to terminate the uasrow, rugged,
thrny path to Heaven.
The action of oar Police Jary in
thus allowing one of oar meest a
portant pblicM rads to be block
ded is ahbolutely iaeusable, and
hasr already eoest the puble several
dollar. in actual breakage, and no
little trouble, delay sad vexation of
spirit, for all of whib soesody is
responsible, and we do not think ito
thcis that tha omee of the
road shoa bear the blame aace
we are told that be is acting under
the dirges instrmctl.s of the Pre
blet of the Pdolis Jry, lowever,
we hope ear aet Grnd Jury will
nvestigate aud plba the blame
where it bls.

Since a very early age of the s
worlds history no enterprise wheth
er religious or secular, has pros
pered without the use of a sufliient
amount of money, or its equiva
lent to meet all necessary expen
ses, money is not, in itself a curse.
It is only the wrong use of it that
becomes "a root in all evils."
When used for a good purpose
and to accomplish a good end, it is
a mighty factor for good.
We ill feel and acknowledge its
power to-day for evil, because we t
have stood quietly iy and allowed
the legislation afferting it, to turn
this mighty force against the best
interests of the niase:.
The people have awakenedbowev
er, to a realizing sense of the
mighty power of money, when
used wrongly, to destroy their
prosperity, their happiness and
their liberties. This swakening
however, is only mental and not
very thorough. It umist become
pactical before any g ,ent good
will be accomplished, in other
words, this same mighty force that
has been used so effectively to des
troy all that is dear to us, is the
only one that can destroy its own
distruction and bring again that
prosperity and happiness once en
joyed. Vicious legaslation has put
hie g eat bulk of money in the
hands of the few, who will use it
only for enslaving the masses, and
for the benefit of this fe r.
They count on the avarice of
humann nature to help them retain
and use this mighty force for the
perpetuation of the evils it has
wrought. Have they counted
wrt oungThe rich put up their one
to live hoodred thousand dollars to
carry their purpose into effect,
knowing that they will receive it
back doubled and trebled, and yet
timhe man wlio seeks reform, when
asked for a dollar for a paper
that is teaching his doctrines,
or for S5 cents to help in
the campaign, feels that he
has so little that he annot give
even that amount, sad it is with
held fill his dollar shrinks to 50
ente orless, and his 5 cents to a
dime, while the one who gave his
money liberally, whether much or
little, to asoomplish his selfish ends,
has reeired it back two to four
folds, while the paper advocating
great and right priaiples, drags
out a mserable existence or dies
outright, and the easmpaign for
those noble prinaciples of "equal
rights to all, and especial favors to
aome," utterly faik.

the State, legislators who can be

objects." All other issues are wo
be subordlinated to the demcn,wis of I
ballot reform. All personal de
sires, aspirations or prejud(ies, all
party allegiances, must, for the
time, be suhbservient to the end
aimed at. The League declares u
that when, through its campaign e
committee, it indict.tes the candi- 1
date of its choice, it will expect its
supporters to follow its lead and
stand by it. Finally, while an- I
nouncing that its first and special
ain is to secure honest elections,
and therefore to obtain control of
the Legislature2 it announced that
it would require an honest and
,eolnoinical administration of local
affairs, and therefore, whether its
.ontLests took the form of inde
pendent action or the indorsement
of ,,adidates put out by some
party, these candidates would be
such as to guarantee a clean and
efricient administration of munici
pIl ffairs.
This is a st roag and bold ennn
ciation of the doctrines of the
League, and will command the
ym-pathy and support of the
pl throughout Iouisiana. 'hey

now undertakes the leaderhip. It
knows what is wanted, and speaks
out clearly and with emphasis on
the subject. It will not allow par
ty issuesor party allegiance to in

which it aims-honest electhions
If any party gets in the way, op
poses openly or secretly a pure sad
bonest lot,it may expect to find
the Ieage arrayed in opposition
to it, placing candidaiei in the field
against it to carry the banner of
honesmmt eleetions. It requires coour
age to announce this doctrine in
Louisina; it will require courage
to adlhere to these orinciples, that

election at least, give way to the
