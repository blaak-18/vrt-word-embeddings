NEW GOODS HAVE ATTRACTED.
Everything for Summer Wear for Ladies, Men and Boys can be found in our immense stock. All prices, all colors, all sizes. Everybody wonders how we manage to
be crowded every day, when June is considered a dull month. Some say it is the electric fans which render our big store so comfortalfle that we are alwa s crowded

THEMI VARIETY, WE MESMERIZE THEM WITH ST LE, WE HYPNOTIZE THEM WAITH QULITY."
And while they are in this helpless copdition, we knock them clear off the Christmas Tree with prices. It sounds cruel, but they all like it and come again and again,
brin in; with them other victims to be made happy bypMistrot Brothers and Company's remarkable, new methods of hoo-dooing. We will tell you oa few of the many
