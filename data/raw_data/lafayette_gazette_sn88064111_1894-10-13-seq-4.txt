If you plant lower end of brace
o against a solid obstruction, as a poet,
a it makes a fulcrum, and the thrust of
the brace surely lifts the post out of
its bed, as everyone has had occasion e
s to hee. Fig. (A, B and C) shows the
a familiar stages of uplift and ruin of i
wire fence straining posts as usually t
l braced. In setting the end post it is
I
'tFZmo. d. b
Swell to lean it backward a few inhebs a
then when the strain comes fully on a
it. it will be vertical.
i In some situations it is not con- h
Svenient or even possible to put in a
s front brace. Then a trench (B, Fig. 4) p
must be opened behind the post, say
three feet away; this trench should be e
four feet long, more or less, according i'
to environment, and three feet deep F
°or more. In it place a stick of durable
timber (A) the length of the trench,
Sand, say, tew. A wire cable (W) can
by put from post to "deadman" (A) as
t in Fig. 4, which will hold all securely.
t But the way I like best, as easier and
neater, is to bore holes through end
post () and run each horiszontal wire
p through the post and down to the
S"deadman" A, around which it should
h be fastened and no dependence put in
staples to hold it. Fig. 5 needs no em -
a planation. When wires are fast the
b hole must be filled and earth firmly
packed over the deadnran when no
strain will more it.
o When one end of fence is anchored
like Fig. 5, of course the stretching is
done from the other end. Observe one Cn

come slack with time and the efI
ciency of the fence largely destroyed. of
I think I am going to like the Homer ly
Steel Fence company's ratchet, as it lo`
goes on the wire anywhere and mayp
be pt on any time.. Use heavy wire- w
No. 9 is a good size. Use plenty of wl
them, eight or nine for a farm fence yil
intended to restrain all stock but my
chickens. Put intermediate posts from a.s
20 to 50 feet apart. It is no advantage
to have them closer than 20 feet. po
For vertical stays to keep wires from fal
spreading, if fence is to control cattle, p.
horses and grown sheep, it may not be
necessary to use any. I have much ho
fence without any stays with posts 20 e,9
feet apart, and nothing has ever run no
through. Pigs and lambs would go
through, however, before they realised hr
it was meant to be a fence. Wooden we
stays, 1z2 by 4 feet long, are oheap and po,
may be stapled to wire without In- fal
fringing anyone's patent; or most any '
of the legion of patent stays are good. o00
I like a twisted wire stay, and when ty,
used your fence is all steel and fire and ce;
decay have no terrors.
I mention this stay and these peo- sil'
pie because they do not ask you to buy pot
their goods and then buy a right to fat
use them-a process too common in cee
the fence business, and with which 1
have no patience. Put stays for sniall an,
pigs four feet apart, and for other *,1i
stock six feet. Keep your fence wires ceE
tight. Da

LA FLECKE FOWLS.
A Famous French Breed as Yet Little
Known In Amersal .
The La Fleche is one of the cele- r
brated French breeds of fowls. The Vt
bird resembles in general appearance b
the Spanish, having a red- face, white y
ear lobes and glossy black plumage. &
It is, however, much larger than that A
breed, the cocks often weighing nine zi
and a half to ten pounds. Its appear a
ance is striking, owing to its comb. a
which is a bright red and like twce b
horns pointing upward. The bird has &
ong legs and body and very compact
plumage.
The flesh of this fowl is very highly
esteemed, being more delicate and t1
juicy than most other breeds. in k

Timr frequency of storms in Nebraska

MnETEOROLOGISTs say that the heat of

Tim photographers of the Paris Ob

Useful Window Desks.
One of the most convenient and alto
gether satisfactory contrivances quite
in the power of a woman to manipulate
is a window desk.
Take a board about fifteen inches
wide and saw it the length of the win
dow sill. Put small iron hinges on it
and screw it to the sill, so that it can
hang down against the under wall
when desirable. Tack a narrow strip
of wood under the board, near the
front edge. Resting on the floor and
wedged under this cleat there is a prop
of planed wood, slender and neat look
ing. You can put a bending around
the board, with small brads, and stain
't all cherry or some other color. The
lill holds pens. pencils and ink stands,
and a large blotter laid on the board
is a most desirable writing pad. This
idea comes from an art studient in 'Pa,
is. wvho dotes on her window desk. It
will be found useful in the nursery as
a place for pasting pictures, drawings,
etc.. and when done with can be swung
down ard out of the way.--N. Y. Hler
