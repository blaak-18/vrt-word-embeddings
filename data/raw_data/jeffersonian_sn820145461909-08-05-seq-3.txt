HIS OWN PEOPLE
OOD BYE—and is this the
end?” He spoke in a tone
less whisper as his fingers
g
tightened over the slight
hand that lay within his grasp. With
the faintest trace of effort he
straightened himself, throwing back
his head in a manner now grown fa
miliar to the white-capped nurse.
It was all over—the four weeks of
racking pain and agonized delirium,
the three of tedious convalescence
and now with his coat buttoned
tightly over a sensitive throat, his
hat in hand, Noel Adams awaited the
cab that was to bear him back to a
world of renewed action.
The girl shuddered as she glanced
fiom a window of the ward, where, in
the company of this man, she had
spent the fullest, happiest weeks of
her hospital work. Within these
bare walls she had fought with high
er powers, determined, resolute, lost
to all save the magnitude of her task.
She had won out, had made good,
and this was the end.
Ihe day of his release had come,
to him the signal for battle, to her
the muffled requiem of dead dreams.
Before her stretched an endless vista
of gray days, of work lacking in mo
tive, of passionate desire and lonely
desolation.
She turned from the window in the
dim twilight and faced him with the
finality of despair upon her white
face. His serious eyes were upon her,
and the usual happy smile was gone
from his lips.
■‘Diana!" His arme opened to her;
without a word she surrendered her
self to him in an abandon of glad
ness.
“It doesn’t seem right—l hadn’t
intended to speak yet, dear,” he
whispered. “You know nothing of
me but what I have told you—my life
as a struggling newspaper man, my
hopes as a climber. I know that my
people are not of your kind, and I
can't take your answer until you have
seen them—have seen their way of
living. It wouldn’t be fair.”
“ ‘Thy people shall be my people’—
you know the rest, Noel. lam mar
rying you, not your family, but I
know that they must be everything
that is best or—they wouldn’t be
your people”.
He kissed her, reverently, as she
clung to him with words of frenzied
assurance. Slowly the shadows deep
ened. A gentle tap sounded upon
the door.
* * *
Di, dear —how lovely! Just in
time for dessert. Thomson—a chair
for Miss Saunders.”
Agnes Osborne drew her sister to
her side, caressing one of her un
gloved hands. Five people waved or
bowed their greeting to the unex
pected guest as, without ceremony,
Diana took her place at the table,
over whose glories softly shaded
candles diffused a mellow glow. The
merry badinage, the hum of con
versation, changed into a volley of
questionings regarding Diana and
work. Living outside of the social
whirl she was still part of their world,
interested in the round of dinners,
the hands at bridge, as much as in the
broader interests of her own work.
She would drop into her old place
among them as naturally as if she
had never passed from out the daily
reckoning of the little set in which
she had moved.
“Well, dear, and how is every
thing? Did the poor wee colored
baby ciie? What of your special—
are you freed at last?”
“Yes and—no. Lean over and I’ll
tell you my secret.”
A gasp of incredulity broke from
Mrs. Osborne’s lips. One of Diana’s
hands rested lightly upon her sister’s
gleaming shoulder and her fingers
nervously tapped the jewels that
blazed in a necklace of barbaric
splendor.
“Diana, dear! Engaged! My es
teemed friends,” with a comprehen
sive glance about the table, “it is my
pleasant duty to announce the en
gagement of my sister, Miss Diana
Saunders, to—to —my dear, you've
not even told me his name!”
“Adams Noel Adams.” She
spoke the words with a timidity
born of tender unfamiliarity..
“Then congratulations are in or
der, Diana?” A pretty woman arose
from her chair and, leaning over,
kissed Diana on both crimson cheeks.
The others did likewise, while the
men expressed their felicitations with
handshaking and friendly raillery.
“To the health of the future Mis
tress Adams,” cried their hostess
laughingly. The clinking of glasses,
the silent toast, brought tears to
Diana’s eyes. Seizing an empty glass,
she filled it with trembling hand,
and stood before them in her simple
uniform of blue and white.
“Thank you! And, now, will you
drink to the health of my future
husband, Noel Adams?”
“Noel Adams,” cried they all
heartily, and resumed their places.
“And when shall we meet him, Di?
What is he like? Tall? good look
ing, of course—that goes without
saying Why ddn’t you bring him in
tonight?”
“Tonight? Why, he was only re
leased tonight. He had to go to his
own people.”
“His own people, of course,” as
sented Mrs. Osborne. “Who are
they, Di? The Adams—is it the Va
lancey Adams?”
“No—no. His father —well, Agnes,
to tell you the truth, I don’t know
his father’s name.” The girl’s
cheeks flushed a deeper crimson as
she realized the impression which
this confession must make.
“Di—how funny! Do they live
near us—anywhere near the park?”
“It’s a long way from here— three
miles I should think. Clancy street,
wherever that is.”
One of the men gave a quick
glance across the table, but kept to
himself any information that he may
have possessed.
“Tom,” addressing her husband,
“do you know where Clancy street
is?”
“I don’t suppose you will have
heard of it, Agnes. His people live
quietly—very quietly. lam to meet
Jeffersonian
Cameron Nelles Wilson
them tomorrow,” interrupted Diana.
“Another engagement dinner?
Child, you’ll die of fatty degenera
tion before your wedding. Well—
I’ll see you through the ordeal, dear,
and you may have that old Satsuma
bowl for your bottom drawer.”
“Thank you, sister mine. You’re
a darling.”
“Come —let us all go into the li
brary for coffee. You men may
smoke there. I hate to think of all
the good stories we miss when you
linger behind. Your arm, Mr. Keith
—you may take mine, bride-elect.”
With much laughter and polite
holdings back the little party passed
from the room.
They dismounted from a stuffy
car, splashed through the muddy
road and walked quickly down a
street bordered by long rows of
houses exactly similar, hideously de
signed, shabbily executed.
“Here we are—and they’re look
ing for us.” Several faces disap
peared from a front window and the
door was thrown wide. Adams took
Diana by the hand and led her with
in the badly illumined hall to pre
sent his fiance.
“Mother, this is Diana.”
“Well —and so you’re the future
Mrs. Adams! Come right in. Girls,
take Dinah’s coat and hat. This is
Susie, Dinah —”
“Diana, mother,” gently corrected
her son.
“Oh, my, yes—Diana. I mind now.
Higgins had a bay mare called Diana
because her back was shaped like the
moon—they was neighbors of ours
down the country. Now, this is Leda,
Dinah—Diana, I mean, and —Nellie,
don’t be so silly—come out from that
room! She’s the shy one of the fami
ly, he-ha!”
In turn the three sisters were pre
sented. Susie gave her a resounding
smack upon each cheek; Leda extend
ed a limp hand, while Nellie was
seized with such a fit of giggling
that Diana stood uncomfortably
awaiting developments.
“Silly! She’s always like that
when we want her to play proprie
ty.” Mrs. Adams gave her a push
that sent her headlong into the par
lor.
“Well —everything’s ready ’cept
that lazy Reggie. He’s always be
hind —’specially when he knows
there’s company. And pa was real
sorry that this was his night on the
road. His train is runnin’ on a new
route and now he’s out every other
night. Susie, fetch in the chicken
and dish up them vegetables.”
As in a dream Diana entered the
dining room. Her place was next to
Noel, who was tenderly solicitous of
her comfort. The table was spotless,
crowded to the utmost limit with a
variety of edibles. A centerpiece of
dried grasses was surronded by
pickles of many kinds, plates of buns
and fragrant biscuit. Four kinds of
cake, uncut, one of them adorned
with a circle of chocolate mice, pre
served the symmetry to a nicety,
while the beautifully browned chick
