The public school under- Prof.
Greig has reached an enrollment

for admission have been turned

this has caused the teachers much
embarrassment. The Board should

for the accomodation of all children
who may apply for admission and

has been given the cause of educa
tion by the establishment of the
High School. Prof Greig and Miss
Jamieson will have charge of the
first four grades of study adopted,
and will continue in the sanme build
ing now occupied. We learn that
several seats will be available next

Installation of Oflcers for the
t Ensuing Year.
Lafayette Lodge No. 3194 K. of
- H. was organized in the year x885
P by a few earnest men, but it rapidly
increased in membership and to-day
,it is one of the most prosperous
lodges in the State. Among its
I members, whose names are printed
e below, will be found men represen
s ting all classes of business. When
s we consider the manifold advan
tages to be derived from a mem
i bership in this fraternal order, it
is no wonder that so many men
join it. Besides the benefit certifi
cate the order has many benefi
cent purposes which should induce
single as Well as married men to be
come members. Some of the prime
objects of the order are : "to give
all possible moral and material aid
in its power to its members, and
those depending on its members, by
holding moral, instructive lectures,
by encouraging each other in busi
ness, and by assisting each other to
obtain employment." Since the
organization of this lodge three of its
members died, their families re
ceiving each $200ooo, while the fees
paid by the three members amounted
to only $3o6. The present mem
bership consist of seventy, viz:

Last Wedneday was the day fixed
for the installation of the officers
elected at the last meeting of the
lodge to serve for the ensuing year.
The officers are: Dr. J. D. Trahan,
past dictator; Chas. D. Caffery, dic
tator; T. F. Webb, vice dictator;
Alfred Hebert, assistant dictator; A.
Labe, reporter: A. E. Mouton, finan
cial reporter: B. Falk, treasurer:
Alex. Delahoussaye, guide; N.
Schayot, chaplain, J. P. Revillon,
sentinel; G. Schmulen, guardian.
Grand Dictator E. F. Dyer, Past Dic
tator D. T. Weil, Grand Reporter
D. J. Searcy and Grand Treasurer
Ed Denekamp, of the grand lodge,
came from New Orleans to install
the officers-elect. The ceremonies
of installation were very impressive
and interesting and were witnessed
by a number of people. Grand Dic
tator Dyer, who presi-led over the
meeting, delivered a very interesting
address and spoke in a matter-of
fact way. He was followed by Past
Dictator D. T. Weill, who told "in an
eloquent manner of the many reasons
why thoughtful and prudent men
should join the K. 'of H. The next
speaker was Judge A. C. Allen, who
was called upon for a speech. The
judge was at his best and treated
the members and guests to one of
those able and eloquent addresses
for which he is known. At the re
quest of Grand Dictator Dyer, Judge
Debaillon, of the local lodge, ad
dressed the meeting. As usual, the
judge was brief and to the point
and, we dare say, his remarks were
fruitful of good results. I)r. (;ra
ham, a pr om:nent member of I.a
fayette lodge and also an officer ii
the grand lodge, was called upon to,
speak and delivered a short but ef
fective address. At the concltisiot
of the speeches the grand dictator
announced that the meeting Ihatl
come to an end, and the gue~st.
were invited to repair to the lower
Sfloor of Falk's opera house, where a
banquet would be served. The re
past was an excellent one; everything
on the table, including the wine, was
of the best. All the participants
being in a happy state of mind good
cheer prevailed throughout. Toasts
were responded to by Messrs. Chas.
D. Caffery, Judge Allen, E. F. Dyer,
D. J. Searcy and Ralph Elliott. It
was late in the night when thd ban
quet ended.
Paid High For Their Fun.
Sheriff Broussard is always on
the lookout for violators of the law.
While on the train last WVednesday
She noticed a party of young men
amusing themselves by throwing
i clstnks of coal and stone at people
standing .along the railroad. The
sheriff did not interfere with their
*"sport" until the train reached
Broussardville, in this parish, where
f they providfd themselves with a
fresh supply of pieces of coal and
stone and when the train was passing
the big pond near that place they
threw several chunks at a party of
women and children engaged in
fishing. When the train stopped
at this place Sheriff Broussard
arrested three young men named J.
T. Martin, E. S. Summerford and
F. M. Sorels, and made affidavits
against them in accordance with the
facts. Judge Martin fixed their ap
pearance bond at $25, which was
signed by Mr. Henri Crouchet to
whom the accused turned over $47
in cash, and two silver watches.
Thursday at x x o'clock, the hour
fixed for trial, the young men failed
to show up. They had left during
the night. The money goes to the
public.school fund.
The Sheriffs' Convention.
The Louisiana Sheriff's Associa
tion of which Sheriff Broussard of
this parish is the originator, met in
New Orleans Monday, and from ac
counts published in the city papers
it is a success, Governor Foster was
present and delivered a brilliant and
interesting address. Mayor Fitz
patrick also spoke. Most of the
parishes in the state were repre
sented, not excepting Lafayette.
Of course, Ike was on hand and,
as usual, took a prominent part in
the proceedings. Tuesday's Picay
une contains his picture and has
this to say about him: "'The treas
urer of the association is Mr. I. A.
Broussard, of Lafayette. He is one
of the most jovial of the members.
He was born in Calcasieu parish
in 1857, and before entering public
office had been engaged in raising
stock and trading cattle. He was
elected sheriff in r888. Yesterday,
at the Crescent Club, Mr. Broussard
took great pleasure in introducing
his friend, Mr. Julian Mouton, .of
I.afayette, as a "sure winner" to
become the successor of Mr. Overton
Cade as representative from Lafay
ette in the legislature.."

The A. M. Hill Comedy Company
Gave a delightful performance at Falk's
opera house last night. The performance
consisted of three charming little one-act
plays. The first one was called "'Love's
Victory." It is a remarkably sweet ltttle
piece told in the excellent language of Min
nie .laddern Fisk. The story gave Miss Agnes
Hill an excellent opportunity to display her
talent, which is of the very highest order,
while tile other members of the company took
excellent care of the characters assigned
them. The second piece was the "Golden
I;Goose," an uproariously funny piece written
by Sutherland Edwards. The story and plot
are most humorous and the audience was
well nigh convulsed with laughter from
the opening of thestory to the fall of the
curtain. The one that appeared to please
most of all, however, was "Brazen Born,"
the closing play. It lasted for about an hour
•ni there was a laugh for almost every
minute of the sixty. The situations are par
ticularly lu-licrous and errors occasioned by
mistaken identity formed a wide field for the
remnarkably clever campany to exhibit their
art. -, l)icased was the aum iece with the
:rt.'rulmance that the management was pre
vaild. ulp,)n to spend a second night in La=
faye're. Accordingly this excellent com
pany will bIe seen again to-night in Falk s
oiera house. Reserved seats for sale at Mr.
