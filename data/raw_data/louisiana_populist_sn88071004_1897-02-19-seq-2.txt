Shreveport made the handsome
donation of over $2000 in cash to
Chairman Millsaps for the drouth
sufferers.
Our friend, N. V. Bush of Zim
merman, is crowineÂ· loudly over a
heoy recently arrived at his house.
No one can blame him, as this is
the first in a married life of 6 years,
We wish him many repetitions of
lhs happiness.
The Populists and Single-taxers
of the 3rd District have formed a
co-alition by which some very ef
fective educational work will be
done. The New Iberia Enterprise
will be the organ of the combine,
and organization will be pushed
rapidly.
Our Washington Correspondent
ays the short session of an expir
ing Congress is always noted for
the pumber of jobs and thieving
bills that are passed and. attempted
to be passed. The present short
session of Congress is no excep
tion to the rule.
One of these measures is the
Loud Postal Bill. The real pur
pose behind this bill is to cut off
the truth and wholesome informa
tion from the people. If it should
become a law it would prevent
such books as Coin's Financial
School and similar 'reform .works
from passing through the mails.
That is, the bill, under a plea of
stopping a deficit in the post office
department, provides for an enor
mously high rate of postage on
this class of books, which would
be prohibitory in its results. The
bill would also hit with tremen
dons and crushint force the coun
-try newspapers, and the result
would be to create a newspaper
tirts, which would be composed
of the great metropolitan dailies,
sad the people would be forced
sona to look to them almost alone
for their information and news.
The monopolies now control the
telegraph wwes and thus prevent
any news or information reaching
the people through the various
s dispatch associations to the
Spapers it that news or infor
utie should be against the in
terest of monopolies and trusts.
The only avenue which the people
have left through which they cau
ot the truth is through reform
lnob like Coin's Financial School
ad through the country newspa
pers. Therredre .the gold syndi
ate and the monopoists want tids
svenu efosed, iust as they have
eosed the aveaue by electricity.
Tie eLaad Bill is one oof the most
luidious asid Infamous measures
that ever crossed the threshold of
Cogres. The bill was slipped

The North Carolina
Senatorship.
'IThere has been an unusual in
terest manifested in the election of
United States Senator in North
Carolina this winter. The Non
conformist, not wishing to express
an opinion until fully informed in
the premises, has until now "kept
still and sawed woodxl." We have
been pained to see populists divi
dt(s mi that state, and it gives us
much uneasiness to see a gold-reo
publican elected by populist votes,
that is, by men who were elected
as populists. If we have a cor
rect understanding now of the sit
uation, it is as follows:
Two years ago the populists and
the republicans fused on a state
and legislative ticket with the tin
derstanding that the populists
should have the long term senator
ship and the republicans the short
term. The fusion ticket won, and
the agreement was carried out to
the letter. Mr. Butler was made
senator for the full term, and Mr.
Prichard w.:s elected for the short
term. At that time Mr. Prichard
was a silver man and made the
fight in that way. lie has served
the short term and was a candidate
for re-election. In this campaign
he saw fit to go back on his former
position and stand with McKinley
gold bugs. Mr. Butler, therefore,
opposed his re-election to the sena
torship. The populists had votes
enough to control the situation, but
seventeen of them iunder the lead
ership of Harry Skinner, bolted
the caucus and supported Mr.
Pritchard, who was elected by their
votes. Mr. Butler has for years
been an acknowledged leader in
North Carolina. Last year at St.
Louis, he and Mr. Skinner work
ed together in forcing the conven
tion to nominate vice presidential
candidate first. Here Mr. Skinner
displayed some talent for leader
ship. It seems to have necessita
ted an increase in the length of his
hat-band.
He was re-elected to congress at
the recent election, and this calls
for another size larger hat. It
seems to be the opinion in that
state that he wanted to go to the
senate himself and gathered a band
of populist assembly members
about him, whom he could control,
and not being able to gain the de
sired prize, he turned it over to the
enemy instead of magnanimously
submitting to the rule of the ma
jority of the party. Mr. Skinner
has done much good for the party,
but has made a grave mistake this
time. It we may judge by the
tone of the populist press of the
state (and we get all or mostly all
of them on exchange) they are a
unit in denouncing this action of
Mr. Skinner. The populist cau
cus has promptly expelled from
its membership all the seventeen
members who voted for a gold
bu senator. In this respect the
populists have shown themselves
more loyal to principle than either
republicans or democrats, who not
only fellowship with, but promote
to leadership, men who opposed
the principles of their party, (for
instance the vote for Hill, of New
York, and Vorhees of Indiana.)
The North Carolina papers are
filled with resolutions of county
and local meetings, concerning the
action of Mr. Skinner and his
seventeen followers, and support
ing Mr. Butler in a fight he made
for a populist senator.
The strangest and most surpris
ing result of the fight, was the an
nouncement that Mr. Watson tele
graphed his congratulations to Mr.
Skinner, when Mr. Pritchard was
elected. This can only be account
ed for on the theory that Mr.
Watson considered himself mis
treated by Mr. Butler in the cam
pain last fall, and took this way
of expressing his satisfaction at
his discomfiture. In this action
Mr. Watson was unwise. He
could have secretly have chuckled
over Butler's defeat without losing
the good opinion of many good
sad true followers in all parts of
the country, but when he tele
graphs "congratulations," at the
election of a gold bug over a pop
ulist, he has shaken the faith of
two million people in him as a
broad-minded statesman and caus
ed themn to suspect that his person
al feelihns are too strong to make
him a trusted leader. We hope
yet to hear a denial of the report
ed telegram of congratulations for
o . respect of Mr. Watson has
always been so high as to make us
loth to believe he would permit his
prsonal feelings to carry away
judment to this degree.-Non
Hon. I. L. Brian,'Chairman Peo
pe's Party 8tate Committee,
atchitoches, L~:
Dear Sir: The testimony in the
ease of Joseph GUazin vs. Adolph
Mger, before U. 8. Commission
er fluery J. Gain, has been go
ig aloug and at times proved to
e quite spicy, and interesting, es
peeially in some of the lower I
wards where sowveral intelli
gent gentlemen testify to casting
votes at some particular precinct
in which the (iazin vote is repre
senlted lay a "0."
In the seven wards of Orleans,
which are situated in the 1st Con
gr,'ssional I )istrict, our "friends
and allies" the l)emocratie ('oi
missioner,, ably assisted by their
"friends and allies" the Republi
can Commissioners, kindly con
sented to give Mr. Gazin 110
votes. In regard to the other por
tions of the District complising
the parishes of St. Bernard and
Plaquemine, where several clubs
and one or two impromptu meet
ings were held, at which Mr. Ga
zin was indorsed, and where he has
a large acquaintance and many
personal friends, and should have
polled some votes, we will try
and endeavor to find out something
about it as soon as the elec
tion returns are received and
published.
If we take into consideration
the fact that at least four or live
hundred votes in the lower por
tion of New Orleans were polled
for the first candidate of the Peo
ple's party, and this in the face of
the opposition of Mr. A. B. Booth,
who devoted most of his time
stumping the district with the lion.
Adolph Meyer, whom he seemed
to think he had converted into a
Populist, it may be readily seen
that the cause of the People's par
ty is not going backwards, nor the
workers getting discouraged.
This committee has been called
upon lately to protest against the
advocacy of the anti-Scalpers bill 4
as advocated by Mr. Booth, but ,
have declined to take any action, i
owing to the fact that he does not ,
seem to be advocating the bill as a 1
"populist" measure, but purely as
a personal accommodation to the I
railroads.
That there is considerable dis
content and even political restless
ness is evidenced by recent at
tempts to organize a Socialist par
ty in this city. The Populists will
however remain true to their prin
ciples and their party, and' it seems
to be more than probable that reg
ular monthly meetings may soon
be called and the work of organi
zation carried on so that a straight
ticket for delegates to the Con
stitutional Convention may be put
in the field.

The Shreveport Caucasian clips
the following from The Sentinel
of Washington, 1). C,, without of
ferine any explanation:
The )Democrats should find out
why Cleveland carried Illinois in
1899 by 26,993, Bryan received
38,242 more votes than Cleveland,
andl yet McKinley's plurality was
142,607.
Cleveland carried Indiana by
7,125. Bryan received 43,001 more
votes than Cleveland, and yet Mc
Kinley carried Indiana by 17,978.
Harrison carried Ohio by 1,072.
Bryan received 70,7)08 more votes
than Harrison, and yet McKinley
carried Ohio by 51,950.
Harrison carried Minnesota by
21,903. Bryan received 16,912
more votes than Harrison, and yet
McKinley carried Minnesota by
53,768.
Cleveland carried Kentucky by
40,020. Bryan received 42,429
more votes than Cleveland, and
yet McKinley carried Kentucky
by 281.
Cleveland carried California by
144. Bryan received 26,473 more
votes than Cleveland, and yet Mc
Kinley carried California by 1,822.
These figures are astonishing.
They are unnatural, and the source
of that Republican increase should
be discovered, or else it will not
be worth while for Democrats to
enter into another national election.
We are surprised that Bro. Gros
jean can not explain a little abnor
mal voting for which his parish is
so famous. We therefore move to
refer it to Boggs of Bossier, or
Snyder of Tensas.

of India's starving and pestilence
stricken people, and the half-paid

of New York City, and almost
half of the laboring people of
America crying for work, and
thousands crying for bread, such
revel is an outrage on public sen

every hungry mouth in America.
