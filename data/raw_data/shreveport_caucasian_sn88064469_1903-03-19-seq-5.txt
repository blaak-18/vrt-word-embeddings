IN THE HOME.
Order, Puanctuality and Beauty Oil
the WTheels of Life.
Home should be an oratorio of the mem
ory. singing to all our after life melodies
and harmonies of old remembered joy.
Henry Ward Beecher.
1t cannot be denied that conscionuly
or unconsciously we absorb into our
nature the beauty or ugliness of the
outside objects with which we daily
come in Contact, and that in pIocess of
time the impression seeks an outlet by
way of our features or wards or ac
tions. The result is scarcely surprising
if we give the question a moment's
thought.
Order and punctuality are two great
rules to which every well ordered
household must of necessity submit.
They are of inestimable benefit in oil
ing the wheels of life, preventing as
they do the worry incurred by loss of
time, which brings in its train wrinkles
to the brow and harsh words to the
lips, even if it be fortunate enough to
bring nothing else.
The arrangement of furniture, china,
books, etc., should be regarded from an
ethical point of view as well as from
the artistic one. Like the golden sun
light, artistic, cheerful surroundings
stimulate the mind besides pleasing the
eye. For instance, a wall paper of soft
est yellow involuntarily sheds its com
forting glow on the mind, while one of
a deep gray or dingy brown hue de
presses the spectator. Human nature
craves light and warmtn, though the
expression of its desire may be subject
to a variety of tints and degrees.
Crowded rooms seem to cramp minds
as well as limbs, and unmeaningly som
ber apartments would fain draw over
our eyes that blue veil ever ready to
fall as the years silently advance.
The good order of a house is like con
tentment on a placid face, but fairy fin
gers are required to endue it with the
beauty of attractiveness. It is not given
to every one to realize the truth of
these two facts, judging from the many
homes in which one is struck by the
dust of neglect, the uncomfortable ar
rangements or inartistic colorings. As
we gaze we pity the inmates who are
so unmerciful to their own minds.
-It should be remembered as an im
portant item in the decoration of the
abode that cleanliness, purity and love,
embodied in the fragile forms of flow
ers, visibly waft a message from the
paradisaical home of our first parents.
The rooms are filled with beauty and
sweetness as they "pour out their souls
in odors." A woman in a well ap
pointed home has a much more attrae
tive personality than a, woman who
takes 4o care of the province _ehosen
of all others to be the settisig of the
jewel that may. lose its own luster
through the dimness of its background.

BOXER MOVEMENT.
Returned Missionary Asserts That it Has
Two Distinct Phases.
San Francisco, March 13.- W. B
Bentley, a missionary who has beci
for a number of years at Shanghai, has
just arrived here. In speaking cf the
situation in China he said: "The latest
atrocity committed by Boxers was
murder of three missionaries in th
province of Chi Li. All missionarl s
are flceking into the cities, as t
country is no longer safe for for-i, iF
ers. The Boxer movement in ('h;,
has two distinct phases. in _.:a
China the movement is against the 1' -
nasty, while in the northern part tt
cry is, `Down wIth foreigners.' The
entire movement is not actuated by the
Boxers, but by a class known as tt
Reform party. In the northern part
there Is an anti-foreign feeling, min
gled with hatred of the dynasty
Throughout China there is a lack
co-operation among the reformers, and
probably for some time to come the
outbreaks will be of small propor
tions."
CHEERED BY SOME.
Ltberais and Nationalists Maintained a
Slg- 'ficant Silence.
London, March 18.-Colonial Secre
tary Chamberlin's re-entry into the
house of commons Monday was signal
ized by an unusually cordial reception
from the Conservatives and Unionists.
while the Liberals and Nationalists
maintained a significant silence. Vol
leys of cheers from the government
supporters greeted the secretary as he
entered the house and lasted several
minutes. Mr. Chamberlin looked
much worn, but was obviously in the
best of spirits as he rose to inform a
questioner that he was afraid it would
be difficult to collect and publish all
his South African speeches. He was
ashamed to say he had made about
seventy and he had no time to read
them, much less collect them.
There was a vociferous Liberal
counter - demonstration when Mr.
Crooks, the new Liberal member for
Woolwich, who recently won that dis
trict for the opposition, took his seat.
WOMEN SENT UP.
Judge Keady Uses Plain Language to a
Couple Offenders.
New York, March 18.-Two women

streets. In pronouncing sentence Jus
tice Keady said: "I am determined to
prevent such occurrences as this in
future. If this thing is to be tolerated,
how is it to be possible for respecta
ble women to walk on the streets with
out having their ears and sensibilities
shocked? It you come here again I
shall punish you to the full extent of
the law."

WVithout Final Action.
Austin, March 18.-The house of
representatives spent all of Monday
In considering Mr. Smith's bill to pro
hibit the giving of free passes to
members of the legislature or other
officers. The bill was reported ad

measures, indicated his unwillingness
to have those measures go over for a
special session.

substitute for the bill. It provided
that the railroads should furnish
passes to legislators, state and other
officials.. He said New York, Arkan
sas and Missouri had such a law. TheI

lowed were the speeches of Mr. Onion
in favor of his substitute; of Mr.
Smith against the substitute, and in
favor of the original bill; Mr. Duff,
who spoke against the substitute and
in favor of the bill, If any action was
to be taken ; of Mr. Robertson of Bell,
who spoke in favor of the bill, and of
Judge A. W. Terrell, who opposed

twanty miles north of this ci v. aoi
the waters of the Mississippi river are
rushing through a three-quarter of a
mile crevasse in the embankment with
a roar that can be heard for miles.
This is the first break that has been
made in the vicinity of Memphis.
Sunday night the water was on a
level with the crest of the levee at
Hollybush, and the present rise carriea
It over a foot higher, sweeping away
the temporary embankments at Trice
and tearing the levee itself from its
foundation giving a new channel for
the flood. The break was of such
extent that the engineers realized the
hopelessness of attempting to repair
the breach, and it was abandoned after
the ends of the levee at either side
of the crevasse had been riveted with
sand sacks and stones to prevent furth
er cutting a way of the embankment.
In the city the situation is the worst
that has so far been reached. In both
North and South Me~mphis many
homes and business houses have been
flooded and families driven out. Street
car traffic has practically been sus
pended in North Memphis, one bridge
having been rendered unusafe while
others are threatened. The tracks of
the Illinois Central along Wolf river
are under water, and trains are being
run through the flooded areas until
tracks can be raised above the water.
Appeals are pouring into the city
from all directions for aid by those
who have taken refuge on high points
along the river and who are now sur
rounded by water. All local packets
have gone strictly into the rescue
business, but their capacity is com
pletely overtaxed and they are unable
to respond.to all demands that are re
ceived. Cargoes of refugees and their
property have been dischorged at the
wharf here and there are several hun
dred destitute persons in the city who
are being cared for by charity.
ANOTHER BREAK.
It Is Several Hundred Feet Wide, but
Near the Gulf.
New Orleans, March 18.-Another
Ideal day enabled much work to be
done in strengthening the levees Mon
day, and the line in the city and along
the river is reported in good condi
tion. The gauge Monday night reads
19.2 feet, which is a tenth below Sun
day night, but the weather bureaus says
that the rise at. Memphis is yet to
come and the, twenty-one foot stage
will reach here. The Bougre levee in
Concordia parish is the northern port
of the state, close to the Texas and
Pacific tracks, is reported weak, but
General Manager Thorne is up the
road and will put an ,army of men
thqre. The first real break is reported
in ; the Burms district, some sixty or
seventy mile* .elow- the city. It is
said to be- several hundred feet wide,
but can (lo no harm, as the territory is
close to the gulf, and few interests will
be damaged. as the water will run in
to the Mexican sea.
Embankments liroaks.
Natchez, Miss., Mk ch 18.-The fif
teen-foot embankment ofthe -Texas
and Pacific railroad at Bougere, thir
ty-five miles below Vidalia, broke and
a gap two miles in length was cut by
the river in a few hours. This gap
was followed by a break in the lower
Bougere levee, which lapped the rail
road embankment o nthe south end,
and the water 4s running into and fill

Secretary Shaw Spoke.
Beaumont, March 18.-At a recep
tion given to Secretary of the Treas

gulf coast. He also advocated liberal
harbor appropriations and the great
necessity for a ship subsidy to build
up South American trade.

The Way to Broil.
A hot, clear fire is indispensable.
The gridiron should be scrupulously
clean and heated thoroughly before the
broil is put on it.
Grease the bars of the gridiron with
suet or kitchen fat; never with butter.
Meat needs plenty of flare; fish but
little.
Put meat so near the fire that it will
be in the flare which the fat drops
cause. As soon as the surface on one
side is browned turn and brown the
other side.
After this turn frequently and re
move a little from the fire to finish
cooking.
Beef an inch thick will require from
fifteen to twenty minutes' broiling.
Trim off the skin from mutton chops,
leave only fat enough to make them
palatable, and broil about ten min
utes. Serve on a hot dish, and put a
piece of butter and a few drops of lem
on juice on each chop.
Broil pork chops in the same way.
Pointers For the Cook.
Rub tough meat with a cut lemon.
Use bacon fat for frying chickens or
game.
Try dipping sliced onions In milk be
fore frying.
Sharpen all kinds of fish sauce with
lemon juice.
Grape juice gives a delicicus flavor
ing to mince pies.
Bean soup is much improved by add
ing a little mace just before sorving.
Chocolate is greatly improved by add
lug a teacup of strong coffee just be
fore serving.
