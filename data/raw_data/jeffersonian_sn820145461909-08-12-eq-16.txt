BIG PROFITS FOR YOU
By selling our famous self-honing
“CARBONITE” RAZOR STROP.
A fine Damascus Steel, hollow-ground
Razor
Free With Each Strop.
Agents wanted who can furnish good
reference. My reference: Hon. Thos.
E. Watson.
D. Y. McKINNEY, Grand Prairie, Texas.
Schools for teaching agriculture
are all right, but in the present cot
ton situation it esems to reach to
ward preparing the boys and girls
to raise cheap cotton. The study of
textile industry and the acquisition
of better business methods should be
included in the curriculum.
The farmers are making strenuous
efforts to build warehouses to hold
back all cotton that they can afford
to keep off the market, and then sell
to New England and foreign spin
ners. The spinners would not ask
any better arrangement than this.
The farmers would realize more by
each building a stone house on his
own place and holding the cotton in
the seed. The quality would be im
proved, and it would be kept off the
ginners’ report.
Each Congressman who represents
a district that has a seaport in it
tries to get appropriations to widen
and deepen the harbors so vessels
can come in and haul off cheap cot
ton.
I think if a circular letter was sent
to the manufacturers of New Eng
land, Europe and Japan stating a
wish for the above things, they
would be willing to chip in and build
a few agricultural schools, fix up
some warehouses and spend a few
thousand dollars scooping out the
harbors — to get more cheap cotton.
THE BEST READING.
On another page we are offering
Watson’s Magazine, Success Maga
zine, Cosmopolitan Magazine and
The Jeffersonian (weekly), all for
$2.50 per year. The price of the two
Jeffersonians is $2.00 per year, and
under our special offer you will get
two of the best magazines in Ameri
ca today for 50 cents a year.
Watson’s Magazine is larger,
brighter and better than ever before.
Mr. Watson’s editorials are making
history. The new Southern novel by
Zach McGhee is brilliant and fasci
nating. The Educational Depart
ment alone is worth the money. The
Survey of the World, the short sto
ries, the poetry, the Illustrations, the
children's department, combine to
make Watson’s the leading magazine
of the South.
Cosmopolitan Magazine is one of
the great national monthlies. Eliza
Calvert Hall writes her charming
“Aunt Jane’’ stories; Ellis Parker
Butler, prince of short-story tellers,
author of “Pigs is Pigs,’’ contributes
his best; Charles Edward Russell,
journalist, makes special articles;
George Randolph Chester, creator of
“Get-Rich Wallingford,’’ has a series
of remarkable tales. Other contribu
tors are Alan Dale, Elbert Hubbard,
Dr. Woods Hutchinson, Professor
Munsterberg, etc.
Success Magazine is the monthly
that clipped Speaker Cannon’s wings;
that first exposed the indecent stage;
that ran the investment fakirs into
the cyclone cellar; that is stirring the
Church to look our religious prob
lems in the face. It prints stimulat
ing talks on character and self-help,
savings, education.

the South, and don’t know The Jeffer
sonian, all we can say is that you
had better subscribe at once. Send
