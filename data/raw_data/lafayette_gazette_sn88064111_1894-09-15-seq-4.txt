A gentleman who has had a number
of years' experienme in the tobacco bus
inesa, and who isposted as to the de
mands of manufacturers, gives in
formation below that should interest
the growers of the bluegrass section.
Be says:
"Bluegrass tobacco should be made
better bodied, because the fancies of
the manufacturers demand it. Noth
ing is now desirable as a filler unless
it has good body; while sixteen months
ago the only requisite qualities were
lenfgth, color and smoothness.
Now they want it tough and
gummy; of course its being
smooth, having length and color
add to its popularity, but the main at
traction of a piece of tobacco is its ripe
ness. The question arises as how to
best obtain these results and still avoid
other bad results. To let tobacco get
too ripe it is liable to 'spot' and to get
coarse and rough. To avoid these:
first early planting gives greater
length of time in which to grow the
crop, and still cut early, which is very
essential to good quality: say to begin
cutting the 15th ori0Oth of August, con
cluding at the same date in September.
To top tobacco high very materially
lessons the chances of 'spot,' and
entirely does away with any chances
of its getting rough and coarse.
When it is topped high it can be
let stand six weeks from time of
topping and in that time it will so
cumulate more gum from the dews
than in a shorter time, of course. I
think for the next few years the fancy
is going to run more and more to wvell
ripened, good-bodied tobacco until an
extreme is reached in producing types
above mentioned. These types are pro
duced at the expense of the cutting
types, and in a few years, when the
manufacturers tire of ripe. good-bodied
tobacco they will then go gradually
back to the thinner sorts, but for the
present plant your tobacco thick on
the ground and top it high to prevent
its being rough. Let it get thoroughly
ripe, which will give it the body. The
extra expense of caring for it two
weeks longer in the field is more than
compensated for the gain in weight.
Bluegrass tobacco is not allowed to get
ripe as a rulc."-Farmers' Home . our

IRISH POTATOES.
Why Not Raise More of the Tubers-Two
Crops in One Year.
Why is it that small farmers who are
short of corn do not raise more Irish
potatoes, when two crops can be made
the same year, and they are so easily
and quickly made, and so good for
family use and for chickens, hogs, and
even for the cows? They save bread
and corn. I am now using new pota
toes planted the middle of March
raised from last year's second crop
seed, and they are very fine. They do
not weigh a pound apiece, but
four tubers will weigh eigh
teen ounces; I have tested by
the scales. To raise the second
crop. I manure the land broadcast,
first working the soil well, then open
the drills deep with turn plow or sin
gle shovel, by running both ways, and
put in some additional manure in
the drills. If I plant very early in the
season. I put the manure on the seed.
If late. I put the seed on the manure.
I do not see much difference in yield.
This manuring in the drill makes the
potatoes earlier, but it is bad for
them, as it makes them scabby
and rough. If you have plenty
of manure put it all on broadcast.
and the tubers will be nicer and
better. A patch farmer should
always keep his pockets full of
seed-sweet corn, navy beans, snaps,
sunnflowers, canteloupes, cucumbers,
pumpkins and others-to plant in miss
ing places. In the potato patch, when
he digs a hill of potatoes. he should
keep on planting from these seeds as
he digs. lie will then have in his po
tato patch a nice late garden. I plant
ed the second crop of Irish potatoes
three times before I got a stand. I
dug the first crop the last of June, and
spread any seed, selected from this crop,
some under the shade of a tree, so that
they could get some little sun; others
T spread in the weeds and brush.
I opened deep drills in the same
land I had dug the potatoes from, and
without adding any more manure. I
planted some of the sets in a week
after, digging. and put about two
inches of dirt over them; very few
came up. In three weeks I planted in
the same drills and put on more dirt
and got half a stand, and in four weeks
I planted again in the samle drill and
filled them up with soil. and got a good
stand. I think the last were planted
the last of July or first of August. I
made a fine crop of themnmoothest and
nicest tubers I ever made.--John O.
Otey. in Southern Planter.
HOGS, CORN AND CASH.
Look After the First Two and the Third
Will be Forthcoming.
Never has the value of the hog crop
to American farmers been more strik
ingly demonstrated thtan during the
past twelve months. Throughout those
long and anxious weeks of 1893. when
bursting banks and financial wrecks
were sweeping away millions every
day, and during all the depression of
the first half of 1894. good hogs were
being grown, shipped to market and
turned into cash in such astonishing
numbers as to keep a veritable Niagara
of hard cash-ready money-flowing
out from the purses of packers and
shippers into the pockets of western
farmers, and this enormous quantity
of pork has been produced at such a
comparatively small cost that almost
every pound of it has been sold--even
through the very worst of the financial
cyclone-at an actual profit to the
producer! Can this be said of any
other variety of live stock or of any
crop of grain that has been on sale
during this same value-destroying
period?
The simple fact is that the farmers
of the west who live in sections where
the corn crop never fails, and rarely
falls below an everage yield, have in
this field of pork production a business
which in their hands is surrounded by
so many outstanding advantages that
they canr safely oballenge the competi
tion of the world. Myriad acres of
land elsewhere can contribute towards
swalting the volume of cattle, sheep
and horses; India, Russia and Argeo
fine can grow wheat so cheaply and in
such qdhntities as to fairly ruin the
American farmer who attempts to com
pete, hut the sun does not shine on any
land that produces the hog's own
feed -Indian cos--in such lavish
;iestern staes.. The hog is the .ane rw;
liable money-maker, the "rent-payer,"
lthe "bread-winner," the "mortgage
lifter" pr excellence of the corn
states. He may make more money for.
his owner some years than others; he
may be overtaken at times by disease,
but in the long run he always pays a
handsone.profit in any corn-growing
district. Other countries may grow
"pigs" in comparatively small num
bers, but nowhere outside of the United
States can hogs making such astonish
ing weights at such an early age be
produced in such enormous numbers at
such light cost. Only two weeks ago
there were over 300,000 head bought
and paid for at primary receiving points
in six days, and even that great "run"
was absorbed without a "break."
There is no overestimating the impor
tance of a hog crop as a leading factor
in American agricultural prosperity.
We have virtually a monopoly of the
world's markets, so far as cheap pork
of fine quality is concerned, and should
make the most of it.--Breeders' Ga
zette.
What the Farmer Requires.
The vocation of the farmer is an hon
orable, independent and lucrative one,
and when followed intelligently will
yield a bountiful return.
It permits of more varied work, a
wider range of thought and more op
portunities for observation and reflec
tion than almost any other occupation.
Mother earth-the farmers' capital
is kindly disposed, and when properly
nourished and persuasively entreated
by the diligent use of modern imple
ments of husbandry, will yield her
-bounties in profusion.
The farmer is more dependent on nat
ural causes for success than other pro
fessiona Rains must come at the proper
time, heat and cold must alternate in the
proper ratio. In other words, the sea
sons must make their regular period
ical rounds and bring the changed
incident to each, but, as these are
variable and uncertain in most cli
mates, it becomes unnecessary for the
farmer to educate himself in all
branches of knowledge, both practical
and scientific, connected with his pro=
fession.
The time to sow, the time to reap,
the kind of soil and the proper mode
of preparing it for each particular
crop, the kind and quantity of fertiliz
ing material to use for each particular
product, the proper mode of cultiva
tion to suit the weather conditions ex
isting at that particular time, and the
proper manner of harvesting, storing
and marketing. To market to the best
advantage the farmer must know
where the best markets for his products
are located and the probable cost of
shipment.
He should also thoroughly post him
self on the subject of supply and de
mand, not only at home. but abroad.
Armed with these qualifications, and
putting them to practical use, the farm
er is able to compete successfully with
his competitors in the race for a com
petence.
To obtain these qualifications the
farmer must be practical; he must
study the results of his work by keep
ing an exact account of every item of
expense connected with the production
of each particular crop.-Rural World.
.Kill the Weeds.
Exterminate the weeds! If a field is
infested with a particular weed, study:
into its character. UMany are biennials
and can be practically exterminated in
time by keeping the blossoms cut, thus
preventing seeding, and since the roots
do not spread the weeds will gradually
"die out." Science is already on the
way to help in the fight against weeds.
Prof. B. D. Hlalsted, an eminent stu
dent of plant diseases, thinks he has a
fungus that is going to destroy the
Canada thistle and not injure our crops.
Perhaps some fungus or a disease
may yet be found that will kill sorrel,
white daisies, wild carrots, and even
the Russian thistle. Keep close watch
of the weeds. and if any seem to be
mildewed. rusty or are affected by
some parasite in root-stalk or leaf, send
samples to your state experiment sta
tion, so that the matter can be investi
gated. In this way the farmer can be
a great help to the scientific worker.
1Hay There.
HERE AND THERE.
-The wild sweet potato is one of the
most difficult of weeds to eradicate
when once it gets rooted in the field.
Farmers should watch for its appear
ance and dig it out.
--What is worth doing is worth do
ing well, and what is worth having is
worth taking care of. Brother, are
your chickens worth anything to you?
Then why don't you take care of them?
--The old southern plan that came
in with the negro, of increasing the
flow of milk with a club. was proven
to be a failure. Now try good feeding,
good shelter and an occasional caress,
and note the difference.
-Farmers will find it more profitable
to make hay for the New Orleans
market at $18 per ton-present price
than to grow wheat for Liverpool at
42 to 50 cents per bushel-the present
home prices.
-The low prices of wool and mutton
now prevailing will result in cutting
down nulmbers illmproving the quality
of the flocks, just as epidemics frighten
cities into a general cleaning up, and
results in great sanitary improvement.
It is an ill wind that brings no good
anywhere.
-While farmers are discussing the
fall crop of potatoes, and gardeners
and truckerrs are studling close rota
tions, why not consider a fall crop of
chickens~? Just think of the good round
prices obtained for fat, plump broilers
about Christmas! Then why not hav
them?
-The earth was not made in vain,
and the place for chickens old or young
is on its actual surface. A board or ce
ment floor does well enough, but it
must be covered with earth, or some
sort of trash that is more or less ab
sorbent, and not filthy in its nature.
Good d * earth is the best at all times.
-It is believed that crimson clover
will be valuable as a green fertilizer
where it is desirable to raise corn suc
cessively on the same land for a num
ber of years. Sown with the last plo-
ing the clover can be turned under next
spring in time to plant the corn crop.
-Topping cotton is sometimes ben
eficial and sometimes injurious, and at
all timnes risky. During a wet time, or
it followved by a good rain, a new
growth of weed is stimulated, and the
object is lost. If delayed too long, or
if followed by bad growing weather,
little if any good is accomplished. as
growth is alray sauRientl7y re~arded
without topping. _
