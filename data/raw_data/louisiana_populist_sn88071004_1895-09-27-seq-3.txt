tday last at Blue 11ol4. Ye assio
ci:ate, who was we\nding his way
ihomeward from ward three. whith
er hie had gone to attend the Polm
list liteting at Newton. arrived
just in time for dinner, which was
as tine as any little crowd could
. wish. After an aimndance of tishl
- had been eaten, the memlers re
turned to Natchitoches. anli fort'I
nately escapel a ducking from the
tirst rain in Septembler.
'Strike.
I The workmen enwaedl on the
' onur1thouse simuck lat Thu'rsdlav
morning. They were satisfied with
r their wages, but as two men were
I particularly obnoxious, they quit
work until the two were discharg
-l. At twelve o'clock on Thurs
day, things having been adjusted
; to the satisfaction tof all concerned.
- work was restmled in just six
hour-. Thus ended the first strike
for Natchitoches.
Died.
j It wars (quite a shock to us on
f Thursday, the 19th, to learn of the
death of Miss Mamie, daughter
of Mr. I. I'. Scarbo)rough. Miss
Mamine had been ill but two days
with swamp fever, and her death
was a shock anti surprise to her
many friends.
Her remains, followed by a large
crowd of friends and relatives, were
I taken to Bethel on Thursday, for
I interment. To them we extend
our sympathy.
From Mr. Jno. II. Henry, of
Henryville, La., we learn the fol
' lowing: Saturday night, Arthur
Lacour (colored) went down the
railroad track, presumably to go
holne. le must have gone to sleep
on the track, for several hours la
ter, a man stumbled over his gun
and portions of his body, scatter
ed along the track. A search re
sulted in finding pieces of the un
fortunate man for half a mile. lie
was literally ground to pieces,
there being nothing by which he
could be identified, except his gun
and his clothing.
SDecased was a hard working
colored man, but unfortunately ad
dicted to dringing. As his killing
was entirely accidental, the rail
road company was exonerated.
Soon the strains of sweet music
: will be heard. The following gen
' tlemen will organize on Friday,
and form a band :
J. C. Trichel Jr., Cornot; F.
N. Tauzin, Cornet; H. M. Hyams,
Cornet; A. H. Lecompte, Bass;
A. L. Godard, Baritone; W. Tri
chel, Tenor; B. F. Dranguet, Ten
Sor; Jno. A. Barlow, Alto; J.
r Emile Breda, Alto; T. J. Buvens,
Kettle Drum i Jos. Tomissee, Bass
Drum.
A good band will fill a long felt
a want; it will add to the pleasure
of our music loving citizens, and
give asend of to all our public en
tertainments. The proceedings of
the meeting will appear in our
r next issue.
Loms CasvYAU , who was as
soeiated with Charle Tuckek's
SBarber Shop died at his residence
on Monday, September 23rd.
ouis was a sober, industrious
and worthy colored man, and num
bers his friends among both white
and colored. His early demise is
to be regretted, asu he was a good,
upright its. His funmeral was
largely attended by friends and
relatives, who have our sympathy.
Some of the most prominent
men in our State addressed the
free silver barbecue here, Thurs
day.

The lGeneral was the irst itothlir"
to deck the rostruim, he oiieneI
with all orahtorial iow(rs he pos
ses,1d, praising the I nemocrats:
telling us of the tooi1 deeds they
had done for the masses of Louis
iana. He lltried to expl in the, no
\ture of the Ixnd issue antid whiskey
certificate, but not satisfactoril :
stated thiat the government loaned
mitonev neither to business, nor cor
iorations, that staitement was not
credited 1by the audience. The
(ten. then tranched ott flaunting
the loo tyl shlirtl, ausin the Pops,
liranding themn as havring tried to
impoSe aI negro on the honest vo
ters of Louisiana in the last Pres
idential election for the paltry ,'
sign of obitaining four eleetorial
votes. The General was asked if
Cleveland did or did not .ippoint a
negro as Recorder of the I)istrict
of Cohubia. hle said yes, to the re
grets of the )emocratie party.
He spoke of the Pops ais a hand
ful of kickers, short-lived, and had
no National existence.
The General was asked if his
silver partv was captured by the
goldites, would he vote for a gold
bug Democrat for President; his
reply was that he had not thought
of the matter; that reply was too
thin.
Mr. D. G. Freeman, of Red
River parish, a populist, made an
aide reply to Mr. Cunningham.
Many thanks to Mr. Freeman for
thinking of us in the hour of trou
ble. We can't coin words into
phrases to thank him for his ser
vices.
There was no silver leaguen form
cd here, nor Beulah, nor Martha
ville. Send the General to speak
for us again, he makes Populists
for us. I must admit that the
General is shrewd, he carries his
audience with him to speak to when
he comes in the pine woods, fear
ing he will have no listeners.

BOOMERANG THROWERS
They Glve ia hPerfermas e in
True Australlan Style.
A hand of cannibals consisting
of four men and two women from
the north of Queensland, Austra
lia, gave a free exhibition yester
day afternoon under the manage
ment of Frank Frost, whose part
noer is Col. R. O. Cunningham, a
veteran showman, formerly with
-P. T. Barnum. The blacks wore
black tights and their gaudy native
costume over their skin fit gar
ments. The women are not p ret
ty and the men have a repulsive
appearance. The boomerangs are
thrown with a spinning motion,
flying with great force, sometimes
reversmg as often as twice, and
invariably returning at or close to
the thrower's feet. The band is
under the leadership of Kng Bill,
a veritable man eater. They also
give the cannibalistic war dance,
or corroberee.
