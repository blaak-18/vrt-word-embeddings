FROM JEST TO EARNEST.
"I don't understand you at all,"
said Pierce Trevor to his friend Ralph
Dewey.
"You talk as if I were a conun
drum."
"So you arel Now, look here,
Dewey, let's have a clear comprehen
sion of the matter. Do you love Fanny
White?"
"Well-yes-I rather think, on the
whole, that I am a little taken with the
sparkling brunette."
" 'A little taken!' How very enthu
siastic you are! And she, poor child,'
is more than 'a little taken' with you."
"I flatter myself that you are righ t.'
"Well, then, why don't you ask her
to marry you?"
"There it is," groaned Dewey; "you
are all in such a hurry. Can't a man
admire a girl without being brought to
book for it the very next day? I won't
be hurried. When I get ready I'll
ask Fanny to marry me. Are you sat
isfied?"
"'Very far from it."
"As Miss White is only your wife's
cousin, I really don't recognize your
right to catechise me!"
"Does that mean that I am to mind
my own business?"
Ralph laughed. "Construe it as you
please-only pray don't bother me any
more."
He threw himself lazily on the grass,
flinging his cigar into the very heart
of a cluster of wild flowers and mak
ing an impromptu pillow of his arms,
crossed underneath his head.
"Sleep, then," said Trevor, a little
contemptuously. "I can't afford to
lose the brightest hours of a golden
day like this."
Our hero had not lain there many
minutes, however, before the soft
chime of girl voices sounded through
the tiny bugles of summer insects and
the monotonous murmur of green
boughs overhead.
"Girls!" muttered Dewey; "can't a
fellow be clear of 'em anywhere? But
they're on the other side of the copse,
that's one blessing, and if I keep quiet
they'll never beat up my ambush:"
They were on the other side of the
copse-three bright-faced girls in flut
tering raiment.
"It's so delightfully cool here," said
Hildegarde Aymer, a fair blonde, as
Saxon as her name.
"And one can talk here, too," said
Marv Bell. "At the hotel one is never
certain of now being overheard."
Dewey gave a silent chuckle at this.
Fanny White, leaning against the
twisted stem of the veteran wild grape
vine, devoted her whole attention to
her parasol handle.
She was the prettiest of the three,
with deep liquid brown eyes and hair
black as the blackest jet, while her
skin, just touched with the creamy
tint that characterizes the creole,
glowed carmine on her cheek.
"Fanny, do let me try!" said Hilde
garde. "It will be such a splendid
joke, and your English adorer is so
long in making up his mind."
"But-but what will Capt. Aymer
think?"
"He'll be delighted; men always
glory in a bit of mischief, and Kent is
such a splendid actor."
"Do, Fanny!" urged Mary Bell. "It
will be just for all the world like the
theater. UIldegarde's brother is to
pretend to be desperately in love with
you and you are to encourage his at
tentions until that slow-moving Dewey
is brought to the point. How I shall
enjoy the progress of the situation."
"But your brother must fully under
stand the scheme," said Fanny, hesi
tatingly.
"Of course; sha'n't I explain it to him
myself? There's not a bit of harm in
it, and Mr. Dewey certainly needs
some stimulus. Now, do consent! Kate
will be here this very evening."
"'She don't forbid it, Hildegarde,"
eagerly cried Miss Bell, "and all the
world knows that silence gives con
sent. Come, see how long the shadows
are getting?"
And the three graces fluttered down
the hillside.
Dewey rose to his feet and walked
away also.
"My dear little girls," said he, by
way of soliloquy, "it's a very cleverly
concocted little plan, but it won't
work, and I've no doubt I shall enjoy
it as much as Miss Bell proposes to
do. "
And he laughed aloud to thipk how
completely he should outgen'ral his
feminine adversaries.
"I'11 keep Fan in suspense for an
other month, just to pay her for thatl"
he added, within himself. "I like the
girl well enough, but for all that I
won't be hurried into matrimony."
Knowing what he knew, therefore.
Mr. Dewey was not at all surprised
that evening when he walked into the
hotel drawing-room to see a stylish
young man in the uniform of a captain
sitting on the sofa and being very de
voted to Miss White.
"Let 'em work," said Mr. Dewey, and
he sat down to play backgammon with
a pretty little widow. Fannie watched
him from beneath her eyelasbes.
"It doesn't produce any effect at all
upon him-the brute!" said Hildegarde,
who had expected to see the recreant
lover brought to capitulating terms at
once.
"That's because we don't put it on
strong enough," said the captain.
"Fannyo-I may call you Fanny, mayn't
I?"
"Oh, certainly," said the little bru
nette; "it's all in the play."
"Well, then, Fanny, I think we
ought to promenade through the halls
arm in arm a little while, and if we
were to whisper instead of speaking
aloud-"
Fanny laughed aend consented, and
the whole evening long she and the
captain exchanged very commonplace
remarks in very confidential whispers,
wbile Mr. Dewey and the widow played
baekgammon serenely.
"I like this," said Capt Kent to his
sister, when Miss White had gone to
her rooum. "She's the prettiest girl I
ever saw,"
"Oh, but Kot, o-s mustn't fall is
love with bo*
"I shall not fall in love with her-'
there's hd dangers" said Aymer, "but
it's such funt I'm so muddl obliged tO
you for suggesting it"
Fanny cried herseU to siees that
night. Dewey didn't seem to care a
pin whether she flirted with Capt.
Aymer or not.
The next day she went out horse
back riding with the captain. Kent
sat on his horse like a centaur and
Fanny came back rosy as a whole bed
of carnations.
"Are you going with us to the Cedat
Falls to-morrow, Fanny?" asked Mr.
Dewey that evening. "We said some
thing about going together a week or
so ago, didn't we?"
Fanny was ready with her lesson.
"Did we? I had forgotten; besides, I
promised to go with Capt. Aymer."
"With Capt. Aymer? Oh, well, all
right, I'll take Julia Symington."
Fanny's lips quivered, but Hildev
garde shook her head at her, and she
did not call back the young English
man, as had been her impulse.
Capt. Aymer proved a most devoted
cavalier and Fanny half reproached
herself that she had enjoyed the day
so much. -
"It's very wrong of me, sighed Fanny
to Iildegarde, her faithful confidante.
"No, it isn't; it's exactly right," re
sponded Hildegarde.
"'I-I begin to be afraid he don't care
for me."
"He's a brute," asserted her friend;
"and it will serve him right if you
never look at him again.
So the glowing midsummer swept by
and Mr. Dewey held aloof, hugging
himself to think how he was outwitting
the conspirators, though an occasional
twinge of jealousy now and then
passed through his mind.
Presently there was a sore outcry
among the allied forces. An order had
come from the inexorable war depart
meut and the captain must go some
where on the frontier straightway.
"The matter was beginning to get a
little serious," he thought, "and just
as soon as that confounded puppy gets
away I'll make little Fanny a happy
woman. Maybe, though, it would be
well to punish her for a few days
longer "
"Oh, Fanny, Fanny, aren't you
sorry?" sobbed Hildegarde, clinging
around her tall brother, whose face
was unwontedly grave.
"Yes, lildegarde," said Fanny, "I
am very sorry."
Capt. Aymer looked penetratingly
into her face. There were real tears
quiivering and sparkling on her eye
lashes and the roses had all paled from
her cheeks.
"Fanny!" he said, impetuously. "is it
from your heart?"
Fanny-silly little creature that she
was-began to cry, and IHildegarde
rushed for ward.
"Oh, Kent! You promised that-"
"A man isn't responsible for his fate,
and I have fallen in love with her," ex
claimed the young oflicer. "Fanny,
am I tolove you in vain?"
Fanny tried to laugh hysterically.
"Of-of course; all this is only a part
of the programme," shle faltered.
"By Jove, but it's not!" cried Aymer.
"What was jest has become earnest.
I love you, Fanny; I cannot leave you
here to become the bride of that
self-conceited puppy. Tell me that I
may hope!"
Hildegarde seized both her friend's
hands.
"She loves you, Kent-she loves you.
I can see it in her eyes!" she cried ex
ultantly.
"Stagd aside, lHildegarde," said
Aymer. "I have the first right here.
She is mine now." And he took her
tenderly to his breast.
Yes-it was true that the little mof
sel of acting had become strong, life
long reality. Kent and Fanny had
played at "lovers" until love, the shb
rogue, crept f~to both their hearts
with almost unperceived footsteps.
"Are you happy, Fanny?" demanded
the exigent army officer when all was
settled and Hildegarde had gone to
tell Mary Bell as a "great secret" how
the little stratagem had ended.
"Oh, Kent," whispered Fanny. "I
never knew what true happiness was
before."
And Capt. Aymer must have been
unreasonable indeed not to be satisfied
with the answer.
He departed, carrying in his keeping
the loving little heart of Fanny White.
Ralph Dewey contempkhted the de
parture of Hildegarde's brother with
no small degree of satisfaction.
"Now's my chance." he thought. "I
guess, on the whole, I'll not keep her
in suspense any longer, poor child. I
only wanted to let 'em see that I
wasn't to be coerced."
Mr. Dewey proposed accordingly in
due form that very day.
"'1 am very sorry, Mr. Dewey." said
Fanny, looking provokingly lovely,
"but-but I'm engaged."
"Engaged?"
"Yes-to Capt. Aymer."
"Now, Fanny," said RElph, argu
mentatively, "where's the use of carry
ing on this pretense any longer? Cl
course I know it's all a stratagem."
"But it isn't a stratagem." said Fan
ny, indignantly; "I love him and he
loves me-and there's my ring."
She held up a pretty finger as she
spoke, whereon glittered a solitaire
diamond.
So Mr. Dewey found himself outma
neuvered after all. and accordingly re
treated in as good order as possible.
while Pierce Trevor, Mliss Bell, Eilde
garde and all the rest returned a unan
imousverdict of "Just exactly what
he deserved."--N. Y. News.
KlRled and Woeunded o Battle.
Twenty-five years ago the great bat
ties of the Franco-German war were
fought. That war of only 180 days cost
Germany. in dead and maimed, 6.055 of
ficers and 110,701 men. It appears al
most incredible now that within a few
months 21,508 French offcers and 702,
048 French soldiers were made prison'
ers or compelled to disarm.

They made a bet. The fat man P
thouaght he had all the worst of life, 1
while the thint man held that flesh was
a blessing. s
"Jest in the ordinary affairs of evefj-
day life," began the fat man.
"That's what I'm referring to," put t
in the thin man. "Go home with inme
this afternoon and I'll demonstrate it
for slipper and theater tickets."
wo they started together from one of
the big office buildings4 and as they
were leaving the office a thant in a big
hurry entered.
The thin man was able to dodge
him, but he fouled the fat man, of
course.
"There you are," said the fat man
as soon as he had recovered his breath.
"Every blind fool runs into me."
"That's nothing," returned the thin
man, as he stepped on the elevator and
was promptly crowded into a corner
by a two-h undred-and-fifty-pound
woman.
"We're even," he said as they reached t
the street. I
"Not quite," returned the fat man as I
he wiped the perspiration from his
face. "You're comparatively cool.
while I'm melting away."
"But you'll have a chance to be com
fortable when we reach a car."
"No more than you."
"Wait and sec."
They each took one of the seats de- t
signed to hold just two people of less
than medium size, and for a block
were on equal terms.
Then a big man got on. There were
four or five other people whom lie
could sit beside, but he singled out this
thin man and soon had him wedged in
so tightly that he could hardly breathe.
A few blocks farther on the seat ahead
was vacated and the thin man moved
to it. Two minutes later a woman
with puffed sleeves got on, and again
he was singled out.
She gave hint such an indignant
look because lie could not make all the
room necessary for the sleeves that lie
got up and moved to the side of a man
of nmedium size.
The man got off at the next corner
and a fat woman took his place. Again
the thin man was crowded against the
side of the seat and his face showed
the agony he was in.
"lint that was an exceptional case,"
protested the fat man, when the two
had left the car."
"On the contrary, it's a regular
thing, returned the thin man. "oun
can see it any day if you watch out.
The thin man never gets a seat to him
self. lie's always selected as a seat
companion and crowded and crushed
until his bones ache. I'll have that

"I dunno much about the laws of a
city like this," he began as lie entered
the central station the other evening,
and I'd like to ask a few questions."
"Very well," replied the sergeant as
he looked up from his desk.
"Kin a feller come up to me and
poke me in the ribs and call me a
bloomin' old kuss on wheels? Does
the law allow him to do it?"
"If anyone did that to you he was
only in fun."
"Mebbe he was, but I don't like such
familiarity, and I told him so, too.
Does the law allow anybody to come
up to you and smash your hat down
over your ears and yell: "Hello,
Ruben!" in your ears?"
"Of course not, but some men are
jovial, you know."
"Yes, I know they are, but I don't
like such jokes. If I'm in a saloon
drinking glass of beer by myself does
the law allow the fellers in there to
call me 'old Borax' and elbow me
around till I'm strangled with beer?"
"Oh! no, but they didn't hurt you
any," smiled the sergeant.
"They hurt my feelin's, and I don't
like it a bit. Has a feller on the hind
platform of a street car any right to
brush hay-seed off my coat-collar and
grin and ask me how turnips are git
tin' along?"
"You are no hand to take a joke,"
said the sergeant, as he turned to his
work.
"No, I'm not," replied the man, as
his face grew more sorrowful. "I here
a lame back, a holler tooth and the ear
ache, and on top of that I've lost five
hogs by the cholera this summer and
had my barn struck by lightning. No,
I can't take no joke. I was calkerlatin'
to stay in town four or five days, but I
guess I'll pull out to-morrer. It's too
jovial fur me. If thar hain't no law to
purtect a feller who feels sad then he'd
better git right out. Is thar anybody
around here who kin play "Hlome,
Sweet Home," on the accordion?"
"I don't think so."
"WVell, I hardly expected it, I guess I
won't wait till mornin', but I'll leave
to-night. It's a one-sided town-all
runs to jokes-and no place for mne.'"
"You ought to stay over and visit
the island park," suggested the ser
geant.
"I'd like to, but I dasn't. If I did
some feller would jump out from be
hind a tree and tickle me in the ribs
and call me 'Old Squash!" and make
me mad 'nuff to bust. No. I'll go
home to-night and take my sadness
along with me, and you kin tell all
the jokers in town that they kin Hal
