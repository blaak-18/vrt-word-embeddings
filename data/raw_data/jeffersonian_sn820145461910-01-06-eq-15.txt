ADDITIONAL LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
KIND WORDS FOR LIVING EARS.
Dear Sir and Friend: —When I
taught school, I taught my pupils
that the better way of honoring pa
rents is to speak kind words to them
while living, rather than plant flow
ers upon their graves after they are
dead. So it is with our great men,
statesmen, benefactors of the race,
those who use their faculties
for the proper education of mankind,
and thus contribute to a higher,
purer, and nobler civilization. They
should be accorded their due mead of
praise while living. Mr. Watson, I
would rather be the author of your
articles on “Foreign Missions,” “So
cialists and Socialism,” or, in fact,
your leading editorials, on any sub
ject, than be President of the greatest
republic on earth. They are master
pieces of literature, and logic; and
those who are not convinced of the
soundness of your views are of that
class whose minds are so blurred
with error, that it is impossible for
truth to make an impression. I have
been a close and critical reader of
your publications ever since you
started the New York Watson’s, and
intend to continue, as long as I can
see to read. I find myself in hearty
accord with you on every subject,
with, perhaps, one exception, which
I may indicate to you in a future let
ter. I am no hero-worshiper, but I
regard you as the greatest living
American. You did more for the
people during that one term in Con
gress than some who have been there
almost a lifetime. Mr. Watson, when
I think of your untiring, unselfish,
patriotic devotion to the cause of the
people during all your public life,
especially in Congress, my eyes are
suffused with tears when I think of
the manner in which you were treat
ed, and cheated out of another term
to which you were honestly elected.
Like “Fabricius,” —the old Roman, —
and Spaulding and Vanwert, who
captured Major Andre, —the British
spy,—money can not buy nor cor
rupt you. Long may you live to bat
tle for the people’s rights.
Sincerely your friend,
WM. CURP.
Nettleton, Mo.
MRS. ODOM’S ARTICLES ATTRACT
. ING ATTENTION.
Dear Sir: —Will you please inform
me where I can get the most reliable
information on Foreign Missions of
the Methodists and also the Baptists?
I have the Methodist Report for
1909. I want something in favor of
Foreign Missions.
I have your book on the subject,
and find that your plan is exactly the
Bible plan. I want to see if all the
&be 3efFersontan
mission work is as unscriptural as
the one I have. I mean the report.
Please give me the address of Mrs.
L. A. Odom, as I am deeply inter
ested in this work.
My husband has sent for several
of your books on Missions, and also
gotten some subscribers for your pe
riodicals.
You are doing a glorious work, and
the Lord will bless you.
May Christmas for you and yours
be a time of rejoicing, and may God’s
rich blessings rest and remain with
you.
The people are being taxed very
heavily now for Church and State,
and the burden grows more weighty
as the preachers call for Missions.
They don’t always succeed, however,
for some refuse.
Sincerely in the work, .
I am respectfully,
MRS. H. A.
