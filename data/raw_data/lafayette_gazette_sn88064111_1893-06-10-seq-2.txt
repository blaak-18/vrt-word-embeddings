PROOF STRONG AS hIOL Y
WRIT.
Some days before the members
of the new council met and organ
ized The Gazette was asked if it in
sended to put in a bid for the city
printing. Upon an affirmative ans
wer being given, he said it would be
a waste of time, as the printing
would be given to the Adve~tiser
spite of any request we might miake.
We would not entertain his belief,
an&questioned his "knowledge of
bthe future." He reiterated the state
, s-meqt with much earnestness, and
a4ded, "this is straight." His
earnestness, later on, raised a sus
picion in our mind that, possibly,
there might be an ingredient of
truth in his assertion, although we
are free to confess, that we could
not reconcile our -sense of fair play
with our creeping suspicions.
After some reflection we decided
to consult a few friends, and after
consideration it was suggested to
apply a test. The first step was to
make a proposition to the publisher
of the Advertiser to put in a joint
bid for the city printing. The re
quest met with a flat refusal-and
the hind leg of the bug protruded
from under the chip. The next
step was to write and present to the
council, in open session, a request
that the city printing be put to bid.
Even then a slight suspicion still lin
gered with us that our informant
was out of his reckoning. Our re
quest, however, was voted down
and this time we felt reasonably cer
tain that we noticed the bug crawl
from under and kick over the
chip.
Are we justified, kind reader, in
believing that the "dice were
loaded?"
NOTE.-The above was in type and in
tended for publication in our last issue, but
was crowded out.
ANOTIER RAILROAD
SPOKEN OF.
Our Royville correspondent notes
in his corespondence published in
another part of this issue the fact
that several petitions are being cir
culated and rapidly signed, to pre
sent to the Southern Pacific Rail
road officials asking for a branch
railroad from Cade to Royville.
This question had been agigated
some time since, but until now no
steps had been taken by the people
to secure the branch. Our corres
pondent also says, that he is reliably
informed that the railroad officials
had under consultation the advisabi
lty of building a branch railroad
fram Cade to some point on Bayou
Vermilion.
The Gazette is pleasnd to learn
that our friends in that part of the
parish will be affortlcd such trans
portation. facilities as must enhance
their prosperity. They will find,
should they secure this branch, am
ple returns for their labor, for they
will be enabled to plant and dispose
of a money crop-cane, where now
cotton pays them so little.
But the people must not remain
inactive. They must get together
and pull together, and meet the
railroad officials half way.
If the columns of The Gazette can
be utilizcd to forward the move
ment we cheerfully place them at
the disposal of the people of that
neighborhood in their worthy efforts
to upbuild their section.
First Communion.
Lest Saturday the children of the
pab, to the number of 17z, ap
proadhed the Holy Table for the
first time, and, also, received the
sacrament of confirmation.
c Catholie church was crowded
the railing to the door, and
*wak too small to contain the crowd,
anxious to witness the imposing
and beautiful ceremony. The church
had been beautifully decorated and
*brillianily illuminated: the altars, es
i- y, were tastefully embellished.
admirable~choir rendered some
t music.
e services of the retreat was
,cbnducted by Father Forge.
~Zj41e acts before and after com
a~siion were read by Miss Alice
4beop and 191aster Auguste Vii
gneaux; the act of consecration by
Miss Dubernard.
Archbishod Janssens had arrived
the day ..before, acco led by
Rev. Fathers Jacobs and Branch,
and was mef at the train - by Rev.
Father Healey. In the evening the
Archbishop interrogated the chil
dren, and seemed highly pleased
with their answers, and compli
mented them. The following day
at half past nine he administered
the sacrament of confirmation to
more than 200 persons. He de
livered two appropriate sermons
that were easily understood by the
children; those young hearts will
undoubted remember his kindness
and his paternal advices will remain
engraved in their memories.
The Archbishop left the same
day for Carencro-rest is unknown
to his untiring zeal.
Much credit is due to Rev. Father
P. J. Healy, for the success of the
cxamination, and the order that
prevailed. He must certainly feel
the wonderful satisfaction that comes
from the consciousnest of duty
well performed. Among the clergy
present were Rev. Fathers Butler,
Langlois, Joun, Chabrier, Mehault,
Branch, Jacobs, Forge and Healey.

The reception tendered Arch
bishop Janssens was perfect in
every detail, It was undoubtedly the
greatest event that has ever taken
place in this parish. There was
no labor or money spared, to make
it a great success. Our people were
determined that it should surpass
anything of the kind that has ever
occurred here in the past, and their
efforts and expectation were fully
realized. They are heartily con
gratulated. Although the weather
was threatening, after a downpour
of rain the night previous; our peo
pie were determined to see that
their programme was carried out,
and they did it, to the smallest item,
with the exception of the christen
ing of the new bell, which had to be
postponed.

Broussarclville Drizzlings.
PFrom Our Regular Correspondent.
Once more it shall be my task to
bother you with a few notes from
our section. It is scarcely neces
sary to announce that we have-had
a long needed and timely rain which
is worth thousands and thousands
of dollars to our farmers. Nor is
it necessary to say that the crops of
Cote Gelee are in the finest possible
condition for the simple reason that
it comprises the richest land in the
parish and is inhabited by a thrifty,
industrious and courageous popula
tion. With the cane acreage in
creasing as it has done in the last
two years our section will soon be
one of the most prosperous spots in
Louisiana.
The erection of the magnificient
residence of Mr. M. Billaud Jr. was
begun last Monday and shall be
finished by the beginning of July.
Mr. M. Billaud, Sr., is on the go
all the time these days, attending to
business: his new sugar house shall
be turned over to him within two
months.
Among the prominent visitors to
our town this weekwere seen Mesrs.
S. Lock Breaux, Dr. G. W. Scran
ton and J. R. Domengeaux.
The appointment of Mr. Overton
Cade to the Superintendency of the
Mint would bring on an election,
for Representative. The Sunday
Law agitation from one end of the
State to the other naturally leads
one to think that the next legisla
ture fight in '96 will be made to bear
principally upon that question; why
should not the people of Lafayette
Parish decide at once whether or
not they favor the law by sending
there a man who should either be
in favor of repealing or upholding
that law. As it stands it is a per
fect nuisance inasmuch as in some
parts of State it is rigidly enforced
whilst in others it would seem from
appearances that the promulgation
of that Law has never reached there.
A Grand Ball was given last Sa
turday at the Hall near Mr. J. O.
Broussard's; socially it proved quite
successful and but as to its financial
results we can say nothing because
we have not been informed.
Mr. D. M. Landry announces a
grand Ball at St. Julien Hall Satur
day June roth and extends a cordial
invitation to the public.
DUBARDI EU.
Royville Items.
From Our Regular Correspondent.
While we live let us live and pros
per! Several petitions headed by
our largest real estate owners, were
in circulation the past week, earn
estly urging signatures to send to
the superintendent of the Southern
Pacific Railroad. Your correspon
'dent was in formed by a reliable party
that a railroad branch from Cade
to Verniillon Bayou, via Royville,
would be built in the near future.
This new enterprise, we understand,
was started by mostly large sugar
planters, whose object is to induce
our farmers to turn all their rich
and fertile lands into the culture of
the sugar cane. Now that we are
to have a railroad, the prosperity
and future welfare of our section
will be a cErtainty. Royville will
be on a boom; business will im
prove; King Cotton will be disposed
off, and all in all, happiness will
reign supreme.
Sunday's rain was a welcome one,
and since its appearance but the
broadest smiles can be seen. The
corn crop is now a sure one, and
judging by the quantity that is to
,be seen in the fields, the yield this
fall will be the largest seen for
many years. t
We thank Prof. Webb for the
kind and appreciated invitation
tendered your correspondent to at
tend the picnic given in honor of
of his pupils last Friday. If not in
person, but in spirit, we attended,
and joined with the professor to
make all have a pleasant and en
joyable time.
Dr. R. Q. Young and sister, Miss
Maud, were visitors to Lafayette
Monday, and attended the Old
Folk's Concert.
Mr. S. Locke Breaux, of New
Orleans, is the guest of Dr. G. W.
Scranton.
Mrs. D. Bonnemaison, wife of
our efficient post-master, is now
spending some time in Beaumont,
Texas, visiting relatives and friends.
Hon. O. Cade and Mr. H. Theall,
were visitors to New Iberia Sunday.
Mr. A. L. Dyer, our popular
merchant and druggist, visited
friends at Lafayette Sunday.
Mr. P. B. Roy, we are happy to
state, is up again and has fully re
covered from his slight spell of sick
ness.
In case Hon. O. Cade receives
the appointment of superintendent
of the mint at New Orcleas, we
would then quite 9gree with Brother
"Totidem Verbis," in electing a
worthy and impartial man to fill the
vacant office. Naturally, coming
from his section, "Totidem Verbia"
will not name his favorite; but,
as Hon. C. C. Brown is also our
favorite and choice, we see no harm
whatevter in mentioning his mame.
CHEROKEE.
Duson Dots.
Editor Lafayettlle Ga/lte:
I will give you a few dots from
this corner.
We are a farming people, and our
crops are very good, consequently,
we are all happy. Nearly all ~e
corn has been "laid by." But little
cotton was planted, rice bei oiut
money crop. Prospects foganether
heavy rice crop are favorableg'but
some are not quite done planting,
as we plant here until the last of
of June. The last crop did not sell
very well, but prospects for this
crop are better, as we will not be
entirely dependant on New Orleans
as a market. There are many other
outlets; Crowley hag two fine mills
in successful operation and is build=
ing a very large one; Lak harles
has a very large mill that cleans
zooo barrels a day, and a small one
that " cleans zoo barrels per day;
California is buying rice from us,
which she never did before. New
SOrleans is now doing with the rice
as she did wfth the cotton. She
keeps putting on charges until these
staple committies must hunt cheap
er rates in handling. We are going
to hold a farmers' convention, and
we will try to get the railroad to
give us a little reduction in rates.
In many cases last season the rail
road charges amounted to s5 per
cent of the net proceeds, charging
as high as $z26 for a car to New
Orleans.
We have now in successful opera
tion the stock law. Many fields
have no fences around them; it
looks strange to ride in the public
road, with fine crops on both sides
and no fences to protect them. We
will have to raise less stock and of
better quality.
The fruit crop is passably good
this year; we have had a fine crop
of blackberries. I have many
pear trees, that have a small
amount of fruit this year, they be
ing young and just coming into
bearing. I have a Japan persim
mon tree that has over, a barrel of
fruit on it; they ripen in October
and are very delicious. ODERON.
