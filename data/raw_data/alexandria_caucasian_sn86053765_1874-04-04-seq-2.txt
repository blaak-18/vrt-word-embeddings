has extended over al !
has already accomplished for the
agricultural interest of several
States, s wow s the* necessity for the
order, in organizing into a society
n r mutual protection, those engag
ed iis agricultural pursuits.
It is not intended fora political
organization, although the gran
gers, particularly in the recent
elect ion.
,n the V\ esicrn States,
.
'have made their power and influ
.dice felt, in politics. They defeated
many of the old ring politicians,
Im had so long pandered to the
influence of grinding monopolies,
-{that were so oppressive to the far
mer's interest. It. is a secret- socie
iv, and one of its distinguishing
characteristics is, its admission of;
the w ives and daughters of those
belonging to tin
membership, and giving them a
voice in all of its business affairs.
Socially we would say ir isa good
thing, as it is* nothing more than a
Farmers society, elevated, purili
order to full
and refined, by the high ami enno-1

1 f these granges will only bring
our farmers and their families to
get her, ami breakup the evils of
isolation, they should be eneour
aged and fostered, even, for ihat
purpose alone. Wein this conn»
try are becoming more ami more
unsociable, the r» suits perhaps ot
poverty, the want ot proper convey
laueesaiid Indisposition to leave
home, may be the causes of this
icvil; but certainly it is destructive
lof happiness and of progress, as
there is nothing which tends to
stimulate, thought and action, so
much as a general and 'mustant
interchange of ideas, with those
arouiiil us. We hope then the
