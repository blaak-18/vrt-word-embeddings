POULTRY YARD REFORM.
eA sdewea* tif Camsageasbio Terd with
r. Separate auldingas.
- The plan suggested in the illustra
S tion is one of the changeable yards
with separate buildings, each bpild
ing being divided into three apart
>w, ments. T e dimensions may be as pre
- ferred, but with, yards 50x100 feet, the
space taken up will be about an acre
and a half. The house would necessa
rily be 16x50 -feet, or about 16 feet
square for each apartment. The open
ings frontm the houses to the yards are
shown at A A A, et. The two mid
dle yards will be occupied by the fowls
of the middle apartment, and the yards
on the right and left by the fowls in
the apartments on those sides. The
L yards marked B may be occupied by
the fowls, while grass or any kind of
its green food is growing in the yards
as marked C. When - the green food is
Wu ready the fowls are turned into those
td- yards, and the other yards are then
a plowed and seeded down. By this 1
ed method green food is always growing,
as
.or ' C , C
and the -ir,- . :.. - d under. As
it is not necessary for hLe green food to =
reach a height of but a few inches the F
changes will be frequent. A novelty
Sin the arrangement is that the fowls I
el - are not opposite to each other in the f
u, different yards, and hence quarreling 1
or fighting through the fence is thus '
- avoided, a space of 50 feet separating
the socks. Any form of house may be
used, and sixteen hens and a male may
be kept in each apartment, thus allow- a
ing about one hundred fowls to the en
tire space. This plan gives 16 feet in
the poultry house to each fowl, while a
the changeable yards not only supply f'
green food, but give fresh ground and C
clean yards, as well as ample room and "
a greater variety of food.-Farm and 11
