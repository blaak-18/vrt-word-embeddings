ICULTURAL FAIR.
Mr. Hill said : " We of the South
are very poor. With" individual ex
emptions, we are nil poor. I fear we
do not know how poor we are. I
.am quite confidènt we do not imag
ine how poor we aro going to be.
As a people tire agricultural popular
tiop of the South aVe poorer to-day
than tlicy ever have been, and they
are getting poorer every day." Af
ter adrritting that they "would make
good cropfrtliis year, ho dampens the
ardor, of his auditors by adding :
"Now'let me ask jon this question,
how much will you mrike this year ?
I will answer for yon. A large ma
jority of the planters of Georgia will
be poorer on the 1st day of Decerns
ber next than they were on tho» 1st
day of January last. I admit that
large profits will ho made by some
people on this year's cotton crop in
the South, but what I affirm is that
(with individual exceptions) these
profits will not bo reaped by the
planters and producers of this cot
ton. Who will get the profits, then ?
you will ask. I will toll you. Wall
Street will pet millions of your
profits: tho o manufactures in New
England willoget many millions; the
corn-growers and hop raisers in the
West will get many millions; the bro
ker's and cotton faetars a;.d commis;
sion merchants will get still other
millions; guano men, life-insurance
companies, ,|ind many other^ artful
contrivances will get the remaining
millions of your profits; and the
great "majority c»f the farmers may
go home and be thankful if they
have food anil© clottëng, and have
settled up their bills, and preserved
credit enough to go through the per
ce rP. mill another year." §
Warming with Iiis theme, Mr.
Hill continues: "I wish I had time
to show you how all the commercial,
manufacturing, speculating world
have formed their i cliemes, shaped
tlje laws, and united in harmonious
shrewdness to gather the prdfits of
cotton planting in the South."
*. * * * *
" I tell you to-day I care not what
seasons may come, what large crops
you may raise, still, under existing
conditions, you tcill ever grow poorer
who produce cotton, and they will
ever grow richer who handle it a fter
it in®produced. Without a great
change, the Southern States are des
tined to become so mat\y plantations
practically owned by the . Northen!
people, and Southern' people so many
hireling slaves to wölk them. And
in this condition you will reap scarce^
ly the wages and not half the respect
you accorded your former slaves.
Under the present pclicy tho Sotfth
ern people in tho next generation
will become the poorest, tho most
powerless, and the most contempti
ble o£.earth's inhabitants, while, un
der a wiao policy, t,l?o next genera
tion of Southern people may become
the richest, the most powerful, and
the most respected of living peoples.
Which destiny will we choose?"
'• Rut you ask, How can this bet
ter destiny be secured? I will tell
you. First, malce cotton your surplus
crop. In these five words; lio the
Samson's locks of your future power®
Make your own fertilizers by resting,
cropping, grassing, and manuring
your lands—«thus you become indç
pendent of.guano merchants. Raise
your own provisions—thus you be
come independent of provision mer
chants. Your cheapest and safest
line of transportation runs from your
own fields und hog-pens to your own
barns and meat-houses. With no
debts for supplies, you will reed no
accommodai ion credits at two per
cent, per month ! —thus yotf become
independent of brokers and cotton
factors and lien merchants You
can theij^sell your own cotton at your
own time, to your own chosen buy
ers and for your own price, and will
get your own money. None of these
things can a planter do who plants
on credit, and borrows money to buy
his provisions. Go on. as you are
now going, making cotton your chief
crop and slavery is the doom of your
children and your children's children
forever. A people that depends on
otuer people for food and clothing
are and must be'slaves."

Let us stop here ?nd rest under
the shade -of this tree, for the old
horse is tired. Isn't this a beîiuti
fhi house—*just in the edgo of the"
city. The grounds are clean, and
the grass is' kept cropped a like the
face of a new shaven man/ A |,( l
look you, Maggy, how thrifty the
trees .are. And how many flowers
there are all about the yard. Let
us stand up in the wagon—the
horse, it won't start, for he is too
poor and tired to run. Look at the
roses and the verbenas, and the ev
ergreens, and the dahlias, and the
fruit trees, and the* statuary, and
the nicely gravelled walks, and the
broad steps, and the double blinds,
and the matting before the door,
and the fancy stained glass by the
side, and the silver bell-pull, and
the rosewood door. And, oh ! look
what a fine team. °Aud what a
bright, pretty carriage. And how
sleek the horses look. And how
gay the driver is, with his uniform
on. 1 tell you, Maggy that man is
rich.
Ah, here he comes! Stand up
on the seat of the wagon, Maggy."
It's an old seat—covered with an
old blanket—but it will hohl you.
I can see down here, lie comes
out ot the house. Here conies his
wife. Ain't they dressed nice?-And
Ifere comes their sou and daughter
on horseback. They are going out
for a morning ride. Ah ! they have
started. See iiow the horses dance
d®tvn the to the road—and see how
quick that little boy runs to open
the gate.

Please, sir, wo were looking, and
didn't know but you would like to
buy some butter, eggs, vegetables,
chickens, berries, flowers, or some
thing of that sort.
"Move oh!" © °
All right. Sit down Maggy. We
will go ou to market. We can't sell
anything except at market, for we
have no license, and it would take
all we have to buy a license. We
could get more for each load of our
produce to peddle it out, but its
against the la«, so we'll sell for
what folks will give us who have
license to sell.
what folks will give us who have
license to sell.
" Why is th isV'
Ah ! Maggy, I don't know. I
wish I did. Phew ! how the dust
flies in my eyes as M*. Bond, tor
that is his naine, dashes by with
his happy family. I suppose its
cause we're poor. You knotv, Mag
gy, I went to war five years ago.
Then I owned fifty acres of land on
the creek, and there wasn't a dollar
to pay on it. I went to save the
Union. Mr. Bond paid me two
hundred dollars to take his place
and go to war. I went.
Y vu know, Maggy, now you cried
when I went; but like a brave wo
needles and thread; my eyes with
tears, my mouth with kisses, so I
could not speak, and told ine to go
and to earn the two hundred dol
lars, and to keep out of temptation,
and to come back. And then, Mag
gy, you ran into our little bed-room
where Johnny and little Maggy
were o born, and nid yourself, and
cried, so I could not see you when
we all went marching by.
"Don't talk so !"
But, Maggy, I was thinking. And
you know I had two good arms.
And 1 used to hold you in them
Maggy—to hold you to my honest
heart, and say (Joi> bless you, dar
ling. Ana you used to sleep in
them, happy and contented. °
I went to war. I was in a battle.
It was a terrible fight. My Gener
al blundered as usual. How any of
us came out alive none but God
knows. I'left an arm there, Mag
gy—I brought the sore.«sump home
to you. And what did 1 find ? Lit
tle Johnny was dead. Little Mag
gy was dead. My poor brother—
whose leg was shot oft while under
orders confiscating cotton for his
General, was home, sick, helpless—
and you were supporting him be
cause lie was my brother.
It was a sad day, Maggy, when
I came home. 1 came back poor.
1 found Mr. Bond had grown rich.
He had grown rich. He had con
tracts. His brother was in Congre? s.
ma n, that y ou are, you dried your@
tears, filled my pockets wish pins—
His uncle wis a friend of Lincoln's
He made war speeches—filled quo
tas —gave bounties and with his
stay-at-home neighbors voted big
bounties and escaped All the 0 calls
and drafts. They gave town bonds.
These bonds ran mo in debt, for
they wert) iq ort gages on our little
farm. Wej" .amounted to flye hun
dred dollars. Tliree hundred more
than I had bounty.. T coyfhln't Help'
it, for while I was in- army it was
easy for those who did not go to
mortgage-my farm in that way.
Ï lost an arm. I earned less than
:i would at home. I returned, I am
now-working, Maggy, to pay my
self for going to war, for losing
my arm, to keep Mr. Bond at home
so that lie could play with-his wife
and babies, speculate and get a po
litical influence while I was fighting,
not to restore the Union, but to en
rich him.
Its pretty hard, Maggy. I don't
care so much* for me for Fit)' grow
ing old, and its little account a poor,
man is, dead or alive. But you,
Maggie—you are as dear to me as
Mrs. Bond is to him. Y'onr lips
are as sweet to nie, your bosom as
sacred, your eyes are as deep, yoifr
voice is ys good to me, your touch
is as thrilling as it rests on my tired
body, your kiss is.as welcome tome
as Mi» Bond's kiss is to him. I
know we can't wear bioadclocli nor
si^is, nor have a clean pair of un
darned stockings every day, nor
clean white underclothes every day.
Nor'cftn we have such soft cicpets,
nor such costly dishes, nor such a
fine house as Mr. Bond lias. We
listen to the robin, they to the can
ary-bird. They ride -out with their
children, .we walk out to the grave
where ours sleep. We drink water
fhey drink wine.
Ami" Maggy, your hands are bard
with toil, but your heart is warmer
aiul délirer and truer than I think
Mrs. Bond's heart is, for you never
flirt your skirts in the fact's of those
who are still poorer than are we—
and stick up your nose in disdain
of poverty, as Airs. Bond does.
1 didn't enlist to get in an office
when the war was over. 'Twould
have done me no good if I had, foe,
of course, when 1 was away, 1 lost
the run of public affairs, and was
not fit when I came back; and 1
came back; and I had no money to
win my election ifol had been fit.
And so I must .work. You-and I
work. .We must sell our early gar
den produce, our fresh butter, early
chickens, fresh eggs, &c., for these
taxes must be paid. The tax-gath
erer does not stop at Mr. Bond'g,
He owns nothing but United States
bonds.® They arc green bills with
red figifi es <'& them—like tlfe green
fields with tie blooi^l lost from my
arm spattered and spilied thereon.
He has a hundred thousand dollars'
\vorth of these bonds. He bought
them with the aioney he made out
of the war. And there are notâm
es to be paid on them. You r$d I
Maggy, with our little earnings and
raisings, with our old horse and
Maggy, with our little earnings and
raisings, with our old horse and
Wagon, by working early and late—
hy sc ]]j„<V the best and usiug the

the interest on tho town bonds, and
we must pay the principal when
the time comes.
We must build the roads.
We must builds he jails.
We must build the bridges.
We must eg'et school-hot ses.
We must pay the town officers.
%Ir. Bond, the bond-holder, pays
nothing. The Government protects
him—but it can't project the poor,
ono ®armed farmer who fought to
save the Union. °
It can't protect tho poor men of
the land as it did in Democratic
days. °
The bondholder takes his ease.
He pays no taxes, for Congress
says he need not. So he goes to
the bank and swaps oil" h is coupons
for greenbacks, and the Govern
ment pays the bank back for what
it paid out. and pays it for the
trouble. It's better to be a bond
holder than a soldier." Its better to
be a dog than a poor man—that is
a poor white man. Tho poor black*
folks are fed, and it is you and f.
Maggv, who feed them, not the
bondholder. As*it'the poor white
mén of A @ meriCa were not of more
consequence than the niggers who
were freed that the white men
Tflight be slaves. Howl wish the

There is one man, one -editor in
the cpuntry, who.thioks as you and
I do, Maggy, I wish every editor
in the country thought fjo. I wish
all the papers of the conn few? would
say wiJsh yoo" and I, Maggy, that it
is wrong to-favor the rich and op
press the poor. There is one man
in the country who dares talk bold
ly, as he does,"when he says that it
is cowardly, wicked, unjust and
danmabie to build np aboodocracy
at the expense of labor. It is cow
a\dly to send, to hire, to drive, to
entice poor men to'iffff}'to buy, bar-,
ter and traffic oil their poverty and
their wants; to sent! -them to the'
harvest of death, and while they
urtj gone steal from them what they
had; to bring them back slaves,
bound in debt. " Call you this equal

promise liberty gave? Is this what
we gain by fbtsakiug Democracy
and building up :tu accursed Repub
