National .feature' of THE ALDINE
must he taken in no narrow sense. True
art is ,osmiopolitan. While THE AL
DI'E is a strictly Asperican institution,
it dqes not conline itself entirely to the
reproduction of native art. Its mission
is to cultivate at broand and appreciative
art taste, one that will discriminate only
onil grounds of intrinsic merit. Thllus,
while placing before the patrons of THE
ALDINE. as at leading clehracteritic, the
prodluctions of the most noted American
artists, attention will .lways he given to
specimnenus froml foreign nmasters, giving
suibscribers all the, plasture and iinstrul
tion obtainabie from home or foreign
sOllrces.
The artistic illustration of American
scenery, original with TITE AIDINE, is
an importaut feature, attlld its tmlarglitient
plates are of a size more appropriate to
the satisfactory treatment of details
than can le afforded by any inferior
page. The ijudicioas interspersioI of
landscape, marine, figure, and animal
subjects, sustain an an unabated interest,
inmpossible vwhere the scope of the work
confines the artist too closely to a single
style of subject. The literature of THE
ALDINE is a light and graceful accom
plintiu'nt, worthy of the artistic fewa
tur,'s, with only such technical disqrisi
tions as do not interfere with the popu
lar interest of the work.

a religious or political sense, or that
counld not he read at any tireside without
objection from the most fastidious.
The circulation of the Saturday Even

is not, like that of some of them, fletitl

ability iand known reputation.
IBy increasing its former attractions,
alind adding miany judicious and pleas

and.a cultivate the plopular ttiste, by in
ereasming industry and lenterprise, ad by
enllarged facilities, we hope to malke niew
