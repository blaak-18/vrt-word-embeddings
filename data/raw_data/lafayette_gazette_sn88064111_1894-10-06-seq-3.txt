last week two yor'ty rnmen or
their way to .Texas c.tr,it 'Min;t,;
Garret, a negro y outh, in the act
of placing obstructions on the rail
road track near this towa with the
evident intention of wrecking a
train. The young men appreciat
ing the gravity of the offense, in
formed the railroad officials of the,
facts of the case and followed the
arrest of Garret, who admitted his
guilt, but gave as an excuse the re
fusal of the railroad men to let him
beat his way. The two men, who
had probably saved the .lives of
several human beings, were held as
witnesses and placed in jail to in
sure their appearance in court. We
do not blame the officers for this
as they have done nothing but their
duty; but a law that will permit
such a rank injustice is an outrage.
Two men going their way peaceably,
discover a little scoundrel about to
commit a dastardly crime. They
voluntarily give the information to
the officers, and because they are
needed to give their testimony in
court they are put in jail like felons,
and though guilty of .no crime are
kept incarcerated until the State
has no more use for them. We
repeat, in jailing these men the
officers only performed their duty,
but what we protest against is the
law whose execution requires such
gross injustice.
The Judge's Charge.
Judge Allen's charge to the grand
jury was able and exhaustive. The
eminent gentleman always delivers
a good charge, and his instructions
to the grand inquisitors last Monday
were no exception to the rule. He
spoke to them in plain and forcible
language and in his own pleasing
style impressed upon them the im
portant duties which they were
called upon to perform. He laid
particular stress upon the necessity
of enforcing the law prohibiting the
carrying of concealed weapon.
The judge said, and truly too, that
to this dangerous and reprehensible
practice could be attributed nine
tenths of the murders comntittedl
in this country. He called upon
the grand jurors to indict every one
guilty of this infraction of the law.
The judge referred to the new law
under which the present jury was
drawn. lie said that in his ojpinion
it was a great imDroveinerrt on tiie
foriucer lawv.
The grand jury is composed of
good and intel!igunt citizcts,. and is
considlere one of the best ever er:n
pann-eled in this parish.

District Coitrt
The regular criminal term of
court for October convened here
Monday morning, with Judge A. C.
Allen presiding. As a result of the
new jury law, an unusually large
number of representative citizens
were present at the opening of the
.court. Judge Allen appointed Mr.
Aurelien Olivier foreman of the
grand jury. The sheriff than drew
the following fifteen names to serve
as grand jurors.: J. A. Roy, -H.
Theall, A. A. Morgan, Albert I)e
lahoussaye, Joseph Lel3lanc, Ed
ward Doucet, Numa Breaux, Alex
'rerrot, Hugh Hutchinson, Martin
Begnaud, Ernest Francez, Alf. J.
Mlouton, A. A. Delhomme, Odillon
Blanchet, Alonzo Lacy. Under
the present law the grand jury is not
finally discharged before their suc
cessors are drawn at the next term
of court. Should the necessity arise
at anytime the judge is empowered
to call the grand jurors together.
If a man is accused of an unbtaila
ble offense it will now be possible
for the court to give him a speedy
trial. The first case will tiiedl
Monday for which day the petit jury
is summoned. The jurors are
bound to secrecy and no one knows
who they are until their names are
called in court. This will, to a
great exterrt, prevent the *"fixing"
of juries, and will be a thorn in the
path of unscrupulous lawyers whose
motto is "that the end justifies the
means."

WeV~ckly iesurm, of Ite of
Interest in and About
Carencro.
- \ath a view to obtaining the
opinion of several of our principal
planters relative to the political
move of a number of sugar-nill-men
in our state. Your correspondent
concluded that an expression from
certain of them would prove inter
esting, and serve as a pointer to the
general feeling amonzg the actual
cane growers of our -ection. The
following question was put to each
of the gentlemen whose replies ap
pear below:
'\Vhat is your opinion of the
present bolt of certain sugar
planters" ?
V. E. Dupuis, one of our most
prominent, and really the pioneer
sugar planter of Carencro. Mr.
Dupuis is president of the Farmers
Union, president of the Carencro
Union Ginnery Company, Limited,
and president of the Carencro Su
gar Company. He Replies: "My
opinion is that our salvation is in
the keeping of the democratic
party, and I am opposed to the
bolt. I believe, however, that we
are honestly and justly entitled to
the bounty for the present
crop. "
Col. C. C. Brown, manager of
Carencro Sugar Company, man
ager of Carencro Union Ginnery
Company, Limited, a member of
the firm of Brown & Lobdell, su
gar planters, and a thorougly prac
tical business man, whose principal
interest is in the successful culti
vation of cane, says: "I do not see
anything to be gained by the ac
tion taken by those gentlemen. As
bad as our party seems disposed
towards our industry, I do not see
that the Republicans could better
our condition; the change will only
demoralize the labor by converting
them once more into worthless poli
ticians. Having based my expenses
on the McKinley law, I think that
we are entitled to the bounty justly
due."
MIr. A. C. Guilbeau, planter,
merchant, and proprietor of Guil
beau's Cotton (;ini, and a man
identified with every leading interest
of this section, declares in a few but
expressive words. "'The bolt is
unnecessary and uncalfed for. I
have always been, and now, and
will ever be a straight out deimo
c rat."

and successful cotot a and cane
lplanter. '-(anu, at a fair figure

The Grand Jury's Report.
The grand jury concluded its
labors Thursday evening. Twernty
seven true bills were returned with
the names in blank. The following
are the "no true bills:"
Homer Comeau, horse stealing;
Aristide, wantonly and maliciously
killing a dog; Jack Mitchell, as
sault and battery; Edmond Berard,
et als., larceny; W\Vm. Harry, assault
with a dangerous weapon; Pierre
Lombert, et als., assault with a
dangerous weapon; Henry Robert
son, larceny; Joseph Levy, assault
and battery; Hemp Benton and
Olivier Guidry, murder; Adam
Priumeaux, rape; Gustave Thibo
daux, cutting with intent to kill.
Judging from the witness sum
moned it appears that a number of
Sunday law cases have been exam
ined.
The grand jury states in its re
port that it found the jail in good
condition and the prisoners supplied
with good food and comfortable
bedding. Thc oflices of the cl-rk
and sheriff were also found in com
plete and perfect order. It reconm
mends a coat of paint on the clerk's
office to keep the zinc on the
porches front rusting, and suggests
to the IPolice Jury the necessity
of binding the original index of
conveyances. The attention of the
Police Jury is called to the want of
drainage near the clerk's office, the
water gradually causing the building
to sink. :\fi(r exaumination the
bl,i'ks of the p:rish treasurer showed
a balance of i.s$6.7 . for the parish
futnd and S~ o0.o9 for the schools.

vlue ,to piublic education. Tihe
highi sct:,) ol, under an eifcient
corps of teacxhers, is in fll opeiration
-with satisfactory attendance. The
grand jury notes with pleasure that
crime is on the decrease in the
Iparish, but regrets that the Sunday
law, in some instances, has been
openly violated, and hoples with the
assistance of the able district at
torney this law will not be as fre
iquently violated in the future. Ti:e
report concludes with the grateful
tl:anks of the gran:l jurors to the
district attorney for services ren
dered and to the judge for his able
and instructive charge.
The following parties plead guilty
Friday 'morning: Jean Louis Bab
tiste, larceny of a watch; Treville
Brown, plead guilty of carrying
concealed weapon and not guilty of
keeing a disorderly house; Jack
Mitchell, disturbing the peace and
maltreating one 1)omingue; Mi
nos Garrett, attempting to wreck a
train; J. Broussard, stealing two
pigs; Pierre Jenkins. stealing $zo;
E1. Foreman and O. Perry, stealing
a cow. Mitchell, Foreman and
Perry are white men.
