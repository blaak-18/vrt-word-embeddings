City Election.
The election for Mayor and City
Councilmen for this city, takes place
on the first Monday in May. The
law reqpircs a new Registration en
tire, and we urgo upon our citizens
the necessity of attending to this du
ty i ediately. As for candidates
for City officers, we are of the opin
ion that the preaeint incumbents are
satisfactory to the people; in fact,
we cannot conceive that a change of
men would give us a better govern
ment. TLh affairs of thl city have
been administered with economy and
justice; with a bankrupt treasury, we
have struggled along and managed to
reduce the indebtedness considera
ble, notwithstanding the $4,300 steal
of the Republican tax collector..
Mr. DeVargas has made a most ex;
cellent Mayor, and he enjoys the con
fidence and respect of all classes. He
is a Republican and will receive the
solid vote of the Democratic party of
this city, which in itself, should be a
testinonial of the high appreciation
with which he is held by us.
Kellogg has issued a call for an
Extra Session of the Legislature, to
assemble on the 14th iust. Ten day'k
is the length of timine indicated for
which the session shall continue, and
the following are specified to take
precedence of all other business.
1. Joint resolution in relation to
the adjustment of the political difi
cultis, heretofore existing -Ji this
State.
2d. Revenues of the State and the
mode of collecting and disbursing the
sAme.
3d. Amendments to the funding law
with reaqi4rt to the'1uimber: of 'pem
hers composing the tending :BotarA,
and ,with respect to the mannonr of
preventing the funding of illegal
e ligatons of the State.:
4thi. Revnnes, financial condition
and government of the city of New
Orleans.
5th. Relief! of the Comdtierce- of
New Orleans from excessive Piiti
charges,. &e.
6th. To consider the incorporation
of the Board of Trade of New Or-,
leans,
These acts are to take precedence it
seems of all others that may be intros
duced, but there are many laws on
the Statute. books, which, unless re
pealed, or modified, will be the con
tinued cause of political trouble in
the State. Mr. Wheeler states: -We
learn free reliable authority, that it
would be well to confine legislation,
to the -consideration of .the following
subjects:
Pqblip Printing, the City hbarter,;
the Fundinjg Act, Public Educatiqp,.
the Revenue Bill.
These must be attended to, and in,
coniectlon with them, others mbre
dangerous and dijagraceful. Such sao
the Militia and Metropolitan, the.City
Park tax and the Election and Begis.
tration laws. These are of greater
iuportance to the people ait large
than any, and unless they are repeal
ed we will consider that no Republi
can in Louisiana desires reform at
all,.for it is in the power of sach as do,
to asseits in the repeal of bad and
grinding acts and the re-enactment of
s!ntary laws.

Our friends abroad must npt mis

What an idol worshiping race we
Americans are. Here is Andy John
son, than whom no more blatant denm
igogueo and time server ever existed,
coming in for his share of the "gen
tie obedience" of the mob. After
briefly howling over a speech he made
in the Senate, that "did not come up
to expectation," some admirer nom
inates him for President. We sim

repeal or enactment of any law that

LOUISIANA.
New Orleans, March 29.--Judge
Woods, at noon to day, had not re
ceived anything from Attorney Gen
eral Williams in the matter of the
District Judgship. He still adheres to
the opinion that he has the power to
select.
The commissions of United States
Commissioners C. T. Estlir and II. N.
Frisby were revoked this morning
by order of Judge Woods for extor
tion in office.
West, in a colloquy with Mr. Sauls
bury on the Louisiana case, said that
he attached no importanhce to Judge
Dibble's opinion as to the legality of,
the Kellogg. government, as "the
Judge was accustomed to political
somersaults, and had jumped on a
horse which he thought was likely to
win." In commenting upon this the
Picayune gives the following bit of
history to prove how experts a somer
sault the fellow West is himself:
Perhaps the political history of the
country 'does not shoir. a more re
markable achievement in the way of
backward somersault than West's
achievement in 1872. He left New
Orleans a zealous fusionist. lie sup
ported the McEnsry ticket. He rode
the good steed Greeley for several
months. One day the Pennsylvania
election took place. West: had re
turned to New Orleans. The day
after the election he was found to
have turned a double back-action
somersault into the Kellogg ring. He
had vaulted away from Greeley, and
careered for the rest of the canvas on
the horse which he saw was going to
win. For lively saltation that beats
anything on record.
West gave example to all the small
fry of the Radical party. The dele
gates who attended the Cincinuatti
Greeley Convention from the parish,
Boullt, Myers, Blunt, &ec., all voted
and worked for Grant.
The following from the Minden
Democrat, we commend to the con
sideration of oUr farmers. The cry
haus been .'"shlt .crn crops" year aft
ter year, and the small price of cot
ton is proof positive of too large a
crop of that staple.
PLANT Liss CorTow.-Since the
war our farmers have made cotton
their principal. pgoduction, few only
plahting even corn enough to last
them half the year. Cotton has
brought good prices, but our people
have been getting poorer and poorer
every year. And it is easily account
ed for. They have bought every
thing at ruinous prices, corn, meat,
flour, all of which they should have
raised on their own farms. The rem
edy is, plant less cotton and more
corn and other small grain and pay
more attention to raising stock of all
kinds.
We append the following extract
from a circular letter from Wm. M.
Lawton, agent of the Direct Trade
Union of the Patrons of Husbandry
of Georgia:
Make tlhres million bales of cotton,
and I'promise that it will command
and aggregate more cash than a 4,
509,001 hale crop will. aliuficture
all of it, if you can, and of every
thing else-grow your own corm and
provisions, export yarns and cotton
fabrics, in the place of cotton bales
rely on your lntelligence and indus
try.
If you do this, capital and the right
sort of population, with implements
and machinery, will flow to your
doors. Men skilled in the arts -and
sciences will discover that the Al
mighty has given to the Great South
tire tairest and spost healthful elimate
for civilised man on earth. :

at the same time and in the.:iasp
manner asthode for the othbr oleemr
elete~kd atlthat time;- The State Re.

On this account, aceording te'thi own
ststemenit .mPide-idediately there
sft, he ireteraeit to the Board,
with instructions to fill it out in pro
per form and in the usual manner,
and topronidlgate the election; assur
ing the-parties elect, at the same time,
"that it should be done." Since this
time there appears to have been no
further action taken in the special
matter, either by the Executive or
the Board.
Previous to the compiling of the
vote by the Board, there had been
two objections urged as to the validi
ty of the election by the then incum
bent, 11. C. Myers, who hald, thereto
fore, held the office of District Judge,
by appointment, under the provision
of the Act.
These objections, which were some
what differently expressed in his ar
gument at that time, may be fairly
and more favorably presented in the
following propositions:
let. That the election was invalid
by reason of the Governor's failure to
order it, in his general proclamation
of election.
2d. That that part of the Act, to
wit: the 2d section, limiting his term
of service fromi the date of his ap
pointment to the 2d' of November,
1874, the time of the general election,
is unconstitutional.
Whilstlt would seem clear that a
party, who isfuactus ofcio, is with
out right to challenge or contest the
claims of his snccessor and whose
only remaining privilege, as accorded
from public policy is to hold over
until his successor is qualified; and
whilst it is equally clear, that asch
questions are not to be settled by tile;
arbitrament of the Executive or the
Returning Board but by the courts,
yet, we do not object to adiseussien of
them.
The let proposition urged, does not
certainly admit of serious controversy
-the question is in no sense r-es,
nowa nor is it one longer open for de-:
eision.
At a very early period in our juri
dical history, the doctrine was es
tablislhed, and has since been uniform
ly adhered to,. that where the tine
and place of an election are prescrib-i
ed by law, every voter has a right to

very emphatic and unmistakable la.
guage in defining the limits of judi.

perhaps, to an hundred decisions l

"Any legislative act which does st
enroiach upon the powers apportlos.

government, being prima facie vaj
must be enforced unless restnrieajg

encroa chament upon the ether brtane

asked, are the restrictions in the C.a.
