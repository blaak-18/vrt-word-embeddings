would argue that the trouble might
be due to lack of wholesome variety
in the food; it may not be corn
bread, so much as little but corn

form of illness which by its affection
of the skin, is suggestive of a form
of scurvy.
Taking an extract from one of the
letters that come to The Jeffersonian
for publication is the significant re
mark, “The inmates here (State
Sanitarium of Georgia) are not at
all well supplied with vegetables.
There is little more than enough for
the employes. The farm has not kept
up with the demands of the institu
tion.”
Like tuberculosis, it would not be
at all surprising if pellegra were
largely due to malnutrition. It is
not enough to have plenty of but one
or two kinds of food; the human
economy must be supplied with a
sufficient amount of all the food ele
ments.

As a coincidence, the dismissal
from West Point by order of Presi
dent Taft, of seven cadets for hazing
Rolando Sutton, is significant. Ca
det Sutton is a brother of the dead
Lieutenant, and about the time the
inquiry was started, seven fellow ca
dets subjected him to a hazing.
Whether or not this was due to a
feeling of antagonism engendered by
the inquiry, or just the usual form
of thoughtless brutality that occa
sionally becomes public, it was grati
fying when drastic measures had
been instituted to discourage hazing.
Col. Scott of the Academy seems to
have done his best to maintain prop

his efforts to naught.

and reinstate the cadets.

ORDER OF TRUE AMERICANS.
On the 29th day of April, 1909, a

Americans was organized at Aragon,

C. Teel, president; P. S. Damb, sec
retary; Th os. Adams, treasurer; Jo

stands for the repeal of the Fifteenth
Amendment, the protection of the
Caucasian blood, and a united white
America. The order is preparing to
become a chartered fraternity. For

THE YOUNG MEN GETTING
INTERESTED.
Dear Sir:—l have noticed in The
Jeffersonians of late a number of
communications advocating the un
ion of all the political parties of the
United States that now stand for
things substantial enough to give
them the name of reform parties.
This may be, and I think is, “a
consummation devoutly to be wish
ed”, but insanely to be hoped for.
As long as human nature remains un
changed, it is as impossible to unite
all the reform parties into one great
reform party, putting an end to the
present ones, as it is to unite all the
Protestant denominations, into one
great Protestant church, putting an
end to the present ones. Any seri
ous attempt at eithei’ will mean only
the establishment of a new political
party or of a new Protestant denom
ination. The old organizations will
steadfastly and forever refuse to
commit suicide or to be Oslerized.
But a new political party may be
formed at any time. I firmly believe
that one should be formed now.
And that it should be founded on
such principles as will draw adher
ents to itself from all the old parties,
reform or otherwise. It is about
such a party that I wish to make a
suggestion.
In the first place, its platform—
national, state, county, and munici
pal—should contain but three posi
tive and fixed planks: (1) the Ini
tiative, (2) the Referendum, (3) the
Recall. All other matters should be
left for their final determination to
a vote of the people to be affected
by the particular measure proposed.
In this way, all attention would
be centered on these three princi
ples, and all opposition narrowed
down to an opposition of these. If
other planks are added to any plat
form, let them begin, not “We de
mand a law providing so and so”, but
“We demand a law to be submitted
to the people for their approval or
disapproval providing so and so”,
thereby putting the Referendum into
action from the very start in so far
as our present constitutions will al
low.
Where, then, will the political
stump speaker get his argument
against such a platform? Can he win
voters to his way of thinking by look
ing them in the face and telling
then that they haven’t sense enough
to know what they want? Or that
they, like the Filipinos, are incapa
ble of self-government? On what
ground can any man who is a Demo
crat in fact as well as in name op
pose such a platform?
In the next place, the natural, log
ical, and eternally proper name for
such a party would be the Legisla
tive party. Its members would be
called Legislators. And when its
principles are enacted into law, every
voter within the reach of that law
will be a Legislator in fact as well as
in name.
Nor will such a party have to wait
for a President in the White House
and a majority in Congress to begin
to make things happen. It will be
gin its work at the bottom, not at
the top.
As soon as it gains sufficient
strength in any municipality, the
three principles may be written into
the municipal charter.
As soon as it gains sufficient
strength in any county, it may send
to the General Assembly a represen
tative who will submit all local laws
passed for that county to a vote of
the people of that county with a pro
vision that it shall not become oper
ative until approved by a majority of
those to be affected by it. Reference
to the Acts of the General Assembly
of any recent year will reveal the
fact that about 100 pages are covered
with laws of a general nature and
from 800 to 1,000 pages are covered
with local laws, laws passed by the
General Assembly of the State to af
fect one county or a part of one coun
ty only; while a little further inves
tigation will reveal the fact that such
laws are usually dictated by a county
boss. All of which must end when
the Legislative party comes into
power.
As soon as it gets a majority in any
General Assembly, all statutes of a
general nature there enacted may be
submitted to the people for apprvoal
or disapproval, except where contrary
to the present constitution; and as
soon as it acquires a constitutional
majority, the three principles may be
written large into the constitution of
the State.
In the same way will such a party
grow in strength throughout the na
tion until an obnoxious Act of Con
gress cannot become operative until
it has received the approval of the
sovereign people. But not until these
three principles are written into
every municipal charter, and every
State constitution, and also the Fed
eral constitution, will it be time for
the Legislative party to disband.
It will be a long fight and a hard
fight, but we will not have to march
a thousand miles on foot to reach the
battle ground. We are on it now.
And thousands of young men, hereto
fore aligned with the Democratic and
Republican parties as well as with
the reform parties, are ready and
eager to fall in line and begin the
fight. Organization alone is needed.
I might add that I am one of those
young men born and reared and still
living in Democratic ranks, but sore
ly tired of the old thing; and now
that the white men of the South have
been emancipated by a proper consti
tutional amendment, I am ready and
anxious for the party that is needed.
What do you think of the plan I
have here suggested? And how can
such a party be quickest and best or
ganized? I will greatly appreciate a
full discussion of this plan by you in
The Jeffersonian.

WILLING TO HELP.
Dear Sir: —I am Mr. Smith’s
granddaughter. He requested me to
write to you in regard to a letter
from W. S. Williams, Ralston, Tenn.
He made a proposition that each
Populist would agree to pay $3 a year
for a campaign fund. Grandpa is
willing to help. So let me know at
once what you are intending to do.
Yours truly,
