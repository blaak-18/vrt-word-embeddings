THE FAIR S X.
SHREVEPORT'S REPRESENTA
TIVES IN NEW YORK CITY.
Winning Sucfess and Honor in Their
Respective Professions.-Per
sonal Mention.
New York, "March 31. 190o3.--Of the
many thousa Is saho come to New
York every .y r. hoping to win recog
nition. only a 'ery few succeed in gain
ing more tha a passing notice, there
fore, it is wit special pride and pleas
ure that we .s Shreveport's dauglhters
in the front ranks of the successful.
Very flattering indeed has been the
success of Mrs. Adah Hollingsworth
\"atkins, who has ch:armed the most
critical New York audiences with her
gift of song. She gra:diiated from the
New England Conservatory of Music
with honor. and later wvon the medal for
vocalization at the New York School
of Opera and Oratorio. She has de
clined many offers t go on the stage.
At the recent banquet of the Confed
erate Veterans, she was especially hon
ored in being the singer chosen for the
occasion, and receiving a large remun
eration-an honor the more noteworthy
because the best singers volunteer their
services for the privilege of appearing
before such a distinguished body. Mrs.
Watkins has been induced to make a
tour of the principal Western and
Southern cities during which she . '1
ii' e her great New York success,
"Three Centuries of American Ballads."
We are glad to say that Shreveport will
have an opportunity of hearing this
matchless singer in this untique and de
lightful program..
Several Shreveport women, realizing
the advantages that are offered nowhere
but in New York. and being ambitious
to perfect themselves in their chosen
professions, are studying at the great
schools under the masters. One who
promises to win-success before the foot
lights is :Miss, Caroline N. Newman, a
student at the American College of
Dramatic Art. Those acquainted with
fIiss Newman's achievements in other
nes will watch with interest her pro
gress in this field of art. Since coming
here she has charmed several audiences
with her dialect readings. We predict
for her a successful career.
Miss' E. Lewis Crain promises to win
laurels as a pianist. She is studying at
the New York Collge of Music. Charm
ing in manner, possessing decided talent
supplemented by thorough training, she
will, no doubt, become one of Shreve
port's best musicians.
Mrs. Alice G. Dale, a graduate from (
the New York Schcol of Expression, p
has chosen the platforms as her field of
endeavor. Before receiving the finish- t
ing touches in New York she studied a
under S. H. Clark of the University of
-Chicago and other prominent teachers,
and gavm readings with success in many
parts of the United States. Since com- a
ing to 'New York Mrs. Dale's dramatic e
ability has been recognized by eminent
critics. Recently her picture and a veify
favorable criticism of her, work ap
peared in Leslie's Weekly.
Miss Lucille Pitts Jocelyn is another e
Shreveort woman who has won suc- c
cess in New York. She has held posi- I
tions in' the choirs of the leading c
churches here-notably Dr. McArthur's
.and Dr. Parkhurst's. While prima don
ina with Sousa's baid' she was urged to 3
take the European tour with the band c
and sing befoge fing Edward. 'Mrs.
Jocelyn feels` that her first duty is to a
her family and declined this and other
flattering offers.
Miss Lucia Moore's ability, determi
nation and pluck have placed her among
the popular leading actresses of the
American stage. She has played with
Keene,' Whiteside, Ward and Dowling.
She is at present leadh g lady at the
f~opkins Stok.. Company, Memphis.
Previous to her engagement there she
was lading lady with ,.the Baldwin
Melville Stock Company of New Or
leans. The Commercial Appeal in a re
cent criticism of this charming lady
said: "The production is .a signal event
in the artistic career of Miss Lucia
Moore. Her triumph yesterday in the
role of Neell Gwynn was full'and com
plete. Again she showed to what height.
her art maI lead4, aid the full develop
ment of :her artistic judgment. Her
performance is abundant in its rounded
and beautiful toches."
Her son, Argyle. Campbell, has inher
ited aer histrionic talent. Although quite
yomng he has done creditable work on
the . stage. Miss Moore claims New
York as her home and spends her vaca
tions here with-her mother.

WE MAY EXPLAIN.
Be Sure You Are Right and Then Go
Ahead.
As a Woodman I hand you for publi
cation a clipping from the Times of
r April 7:
"WOODMEN OF THE WORLD
'Unveil Monuments Over the Graves
of Departed Brothers.
e "Sunday afternoon Broad Ax camp,
\Woodmen of the \Vorld, assisted by the
- members of Sand Beach and Maple
- camps, held a grand ceremony at the
Sprague street cemetery. The function
.'was the unveiling of two monuments to
,'eccr:sed members of the camp and the
exercises were of the most interesting
character.
"The joint camps of the Woodmen,
headed by Rettig's band, marched from
the -ail of Maple camp to the cemetery,
a number of ladies of the \Voodmcn's
circle being in line in carriages.
"Arriving at the graves of the de
ceased sovereigns sweet music was ren
dered by a quartette of choppers, led by
Brother Parker of Broad Ax camp.
Sovereign J. Henry Shepherd then de
livered a feeling oration over the graves
of the deceased, in which he paid a high
tribute to the memory of the dephrted
and the beautiful custom of the Wood
men of perpetuating the memory of the
departed members by the erection of
beautiful monuments.
"The ceremonies were brought to an
end by a selection of vocal music by the
\Voodmen quartette and the camps
marched back to their meeting rooms."
As you will note it is peculiar and it
is not what a polished French gentle
man would style a "chef d'cuz're"-in
English, 'a rare bit. It may be said that
this report of an event which was in
teresting to hundreds and thousands of
people in Shreveport is misleading and
incorrect. Two monuments were un
veiled. but there is no mention of the
names of the deceased to whom these
tokens of love in marble were dedicated.
The report sjh'oild have stated that the
molumnents .were erected to the mnemory
cf V. WV. Caperton and Jos. Laenger.
The ladies - of the \Voodmen circle
were not "in line in carriages" but were
in waiting tas the, cemetery.
l'here was no "feeling oration over
the graves " the deceased." whose
graves are t the extreme end,
of the cen ut'-yG o
-ertign J. Henry Shepherd followed the
solemn rites at eacr grave, at which the
sextette led by Brother L Parker dis
coursed in touching, feeling strain sa
cred selections, and with this splendid
oration from a g'allery platform there
was closed an event which impressed
deeply the vast throng of ladies and
gentlemen (not Woodmen), an `event
which merited, in public print, more
than a passing notice nearly two days
after its occurrence. Respectfully,
BROADAXE.
April 7.
It is evident that "Broadaxe" has no
appreciation of the report; and we may
explain. There was no reporteq any
uPhe:e about, and having heard 6f the
unveiling ceremony it was natural that
something be said even thirty-six hours
after the happening. It was an"off-hand
effort" such as are frequently "worked
off" from the sanctum sanctorum. "Off
hand efforts" are all right if guaged ac
curately, but a mess when they are fired
without regard to facts.
We may explain with a story. Some
years ago when the editor of the Cau
casian was local news grinder for the
Times, there should have been held on
a fixed date, in the Eighth Ward of
Caddo parish, a big Democratic rally at
which several of the big oratorial guns
were programmed for speeches. but ow
ing to a sudden and heavy local storm,
wind, thunder, lightning and rain which
continued until dark, there was no rally.
The news grinder could not attend, and
the opposition man had been left. The
then Times grinder having determined
on "doing up" the opposition sheet, sat
himself down on a handy half barrel
and detailed in his most felicitous style
the rally of the day. with excerpts from
the orators "accentuated" and "punctu
ated" in appropriate places with vocif-'
erous applause, etc., etc. It was after
midnight when the gem, with flaring
headlines and a rooster, was on the
press, and with a feeling of "exultant
pride" the grinder stepped around the
corner to be refreshed, when to his
amazement and good fortune he met
several of the orators who were busy
cleaning mud lumps from their throats
- stimulating." When the grinder real
ized the all-powerfel truth he did not
tarry for refreshments, and almost in a
twinkle his shouts were heard in the
press room "Stop! stop the press!
Shoel's to play.", There was consterna
tion all about. With a few words of ex
planation, the form was lifted, the rally
taken out and dumped on the "dead
stone," exchanged for other matter al
ready "dead" but resurrected to fill up
the vacancy of the lifted rally. It is said
that many of the readers expressed the
opinion that they had read that matter
somewhere, but there was no explana
tion whatever. Thg whole office was
muzzled on that rally and "don't you
forget it." Since then the news grinder
has always had in mind the old saw cf
Davy Crockett: "Be sure you are right
and then go ahead."
We believe we have explained with
this story why the Times man was
mixed in his Woodmen."
THE CONF'DERATE REUNION.
A few days since General John B.
Gordon. in talking over the Confeder
ate reunion. declared that he favored
Necv Orleans, as a permanent reunion
city. The Caucasian has expressed itself
many times on this question, so have
the members of the General LeRoy
Stafford Camp of .Shreveport, all of
whom favor New Orleans as the site
where the reunions should be held, the
headquarters at which every "Johnny
Reb" visiting that city could congre
t . New' Orlean s-ho l
he and we trust will be favored as the
permanent reunion city of the Confed
erate Veterans.

TIlE ROLICE MATTER.
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FIEU
TENANT AND OFFICER.
A Negro Involved in the Recrimination.
Lieutenant Basch and Officer Fitz
patrick Disagree as to Facts.
On Saturday night a negro named
Williams was arrested at the Union
Depot by Officer Fitzpatrick, whom he
charged with carrying concealed weap
ons. This negro was from Ferguson,
Ark., with his wife and children, en
route to Sodus,a La., where he said he
intended to buy a home. On being
searched at the station, which he
reached without having offered any op
position to his arrest, he was searched.
as is the rule. He had on his person
over $9oo. He explained as reason for
carrying the pistol that he intended to
defend himself against any attempt to
rob him. Having satisfied himself that
Williams was all right, Lieutenant
Basch, who was on duty, handed back
the money to the prisoner, who on
leaving $iio as a deposit bond, was re
leased. He agreed to return for trial
Saturday. j The action of Lieutenant
Basch was strictly in accordance with
the law. Lieutenant Basch then detailed
Officer McKinney to go with Williams
to the Union Depot with instructions to
Fitzpatrick to see that Williams board
ed the train. Williams' pistol had been
returned to him unloaded and was in a
basket carried by his wife. Lieutenant
Basch charges that Officer Fitzpatrick
disobeyed orders when he attempted to
re-arrest the negro who had given bond,
and that he was under the influence of
liquor,At any rate there was a lively
combat between the officer and the ne
gro. who, after having received two
blows and been knocked down, grap
pled with the officer, who received sev
eral cuts on the head and was taken to
the sanitarium for treatment. It was
believed he had been fatally hurt, but he
is doing well. The negro fled and al
though pursued with dogs, eluded cap
ture by inducing a boy to let him ride
on a mule for which he gave the boy $5.
When last heard from Wi!liams was at
Sods's.
;In bis satement of the. ase ()Oicer
'Fitzpatrick denies being intoxicated or
having any whiskey about him. He
stated that the negro on his way to the
station had offered to pay him $25 to
secure his release. On reaching the de
pot from the station, to his inquiry how
he (tie negro) had got put. that the
negro's reply was surly abd that when
he (Eitzpatrick) declared that he would
again search him for that pistol, that he
was grabbed by the negro who butted
him in the stomach, secured his club,
with which he was clubbed senseless.
This is about the version of Lieuten
rant Basch and of Officer Fitzpatrick.
There are many who criticise Baseh
for having released the negro, but in
law he had a right to let the man go on
bond, as the amount deposited would
more than cover the fine which the city
court could impose, and in defense of
the lieutenant it may be said that a
white man named Bassett, of Texas, ar
rested Saturday night at the Union De
pot and charged with carrying concealed
weapons, was tried on Monday in the
city court, and he was fined $15 includ
ing the costs.
This is an unfortunate affair, but it
should be thoroughly investigated.
