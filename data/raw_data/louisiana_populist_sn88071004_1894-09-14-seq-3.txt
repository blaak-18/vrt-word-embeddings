Midnight Carousal.
On Monday night about half
past 12 o'clock the peaceful slum
bers of thle citizens of Natchito
ches were disturbed by would be
imitators of the wild Westerner.
An unknown number of unknown
persons after tanking up on liquor
proceeded to take in the city by
swearing, shooting and doing
other devilment. An investigation
Tuesday morning disclosed the
fact that several street lamps had
been shot into and broken.
Since writing the above several
parties have been arrested and
when brought before the mayor
pleaded guilty and manifested a
spirit of repentance, Ills Honor
the mayor fined each, the aggrega
ted fines reaching $270, or im
prisonment aggregating 115 days.
The parties were also arrested by
the constable and will be held to
appear before the District Court to
answer all of the charges and the
consequences may be heavy, but
they have no one to blame for it
but themselves.
Out of consideration for their re
pentance we withhold names and
trust that this may be a lesson to
them that will cause old age to
blossom with honor and respect
from the best of citizens. May it
teach them that a civilized people
cannot and will not tolerate such
conduct. We would say to them
that, if this is their first indulgence
in this past-time that it is but
the first mile post on a down
ward road to degredation, and
if followed will inevitably lead to
the penitentiary or to a scene on
the gallows. We say this with
all kindness to the parties con
cerned and trust that a spirit
of reformation may set in among
them that will bring them into the
highest respect among their fellow
men.
Burglary.
A burglar entered the saloon of
Mr. J. Jones Johnson and relieved
the cash till of about $3 and seem
ed to have been satisded as he
bothered nothing else. An exami
nation showed that the door was
left unlocked the night before.
Public Speakig.
Hon. H. L. Brian will address
the citizens of Oak Grove church

day Of September, 1894, at 2 o'clock

We want everybody to attend.

Our publisher, Mr. Latham, re
ceived a letter from his step-father
