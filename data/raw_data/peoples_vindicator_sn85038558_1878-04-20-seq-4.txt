OUR WASHINGTON LETITER.
WASHINGTON D. C., April 6, 15 .
All that the House did yesterhday
was to declare the office of Doorkeep
er vacant. There had been two dda' s
of rather pointless debate over the
proposition, and the result, whatever
it might have been, would have belen
hailed with satisfaction. 'There ought
to be some way of getring rid of oh
jectionable odflcers of the t wo iHo,es
without the necessity fti so r h ex teinh d
discussion as was had in ithis e,.' *s.. I
would be better thart rith Sp',.Lkr unill

gret its action, andl that it did llnot
adopt the suggestion of that hleel
headed Democrat, Eden, of liiilni.
who wished simply to censure (c'l.
Polk.
At the end of yesterday's session A
Democratic caulcu waIS annoiu+iicl
for this evening. -It is not thoui.l;t
than any matter except the Ihor
keepership will be discussed in tin,
caucus. There is a suggestion .iltde
that the gallant veteran., Genl ..Is.
Shields be tendered the place. ' Thi'
hero of two wars, now in abject iot- l
arty, would worthily til tile i,iuc~,
and deserves any recogrnition tlti
may be given him.
That uncomfortable renregalde fiolnt
all political parties, aiid moral traminl.
Donn Piatt, has his hands fuill just
at this time. He has eng:,ed in a
contest with General Slhero~iu , ;larl
the General has written a letter fitll
of vigorous English, and having the
vim which shows that its r iiter i.
thoroughly aroused. The (C'pitl.
Piatt's paper, has lost inuch ,f IhJle
standing that it once had lhere. ii 1,
short, instead of beingi wit a; d
mischievous, as formerly, it is lis I
reputable, and has the Iali al e i t li , .t
a blackmailing sheet.
Mr. Glover is pushing, in the I! n,:, e
his bill which res.toi(c s to Attaill net' s :

our unwlittel hiaw which gave to I
heads of little Burealis iln the Depalt - I
ments the power to exclude a Cushing, (
a Black or wCarpenter from the priv- v
ilege of acting as an attorney, has I
been so long in force that it will not s
easily die, at d I am sure that nothing n
more is needed, than that people's at- a
tention he called to it. C
The suggestion made in this co.r- I
respondence that Senate and iIHouse
Committees be appointed- to takle inri
to consideratlon our cotunterci tl, i a
other relations with the Doinlinion of
'Cauada, meets with a great deal of ci
favor. .1
Some Democrats object because ri
Blaine will doubtless he made chair- st
man, but they should remember that b
the Senate has l Blaine on its hands iti
for five years longer, and that if he hi
can be made useful aty where it i. on Ill
seach a Commttee. Perhaps, too, it li
put in charge of so important a snutl- is
ject he would study it and master it, ct
as he did the duties of the speaker- in
ship, and in that case the Senate and tr
the people would be spared suach un- w
conaidered, incoherent and trashy a
speeches as lie has been making du- w
ring this session. It is probabie that to
Stephens, of Georgia, or Eden, of Il- in
linois, will be made Chairllunr of' the of
House Committee if it is decidedthat T
the Committee be raised. ti

The re-union of Theodore Tilton Tli

now regarded as an accomplishled fact. eii
Mr. Shearnoln to-day, without saying 'lo

that Mrs. Tilton had capitulated to of s
her husband and her mother. Mr. thnt
Beecher's friends are divided in opln- tie
ion. Some regard itas the best thing that
that could possibly happen. They clor
argae that if Tilton did not know all stab
hie chllargee were false lie would not be hot
so stupid as to beg his wife to return titi
