knew nothing about the transposition
of the votes. The copy that Little- C
field made I put on file. There was
ho statement made that the original T
had been destroyed or lost, but the
plaper purpoted to be a correct copy a
of the original. I saw the copy last Orb
about Jan. 1, when I gave the House
Committee a copy. It was certified
As a correct copy of the st;atement on coW

on the boiard wh~in I told him to make
a copy of the Vernon return, but lie 1 I
left a few days after. Littlefield tol prot

the bonard the next morning.

Senator \\adleigh. , lie testified: Co
s I did hot see Littlefield talking
with Gov. Wells about making eras- inv
Sores. I first heard of the chanllge in N
the returns t'lhen I redd It in tihe news

and saw that the Vernon return had mi
been changed. I could not find the 01e
original. Littlefield said first it was

stroyed. I repbrte4 the fact to Abell.; Li

Generally Littlefield called off the

desired, lie could falsit the returns. an(

To Senator Sanilsbnly-I did not ont
