Miss.. Postoffice-A Play for Ne
grnu Vote in Next Convention.
A Washington special of recent late
i, the Memphis Commercial Appeal
says: Ilas Theodore Roosevelt gone
Ima 4 This is the question that is on the
tips if everyone's tongue here& and
every development in the Southern situ
ation, as it is denominated, strengthens
the view that he has. Today he and his
cabinet ministers spent an hour Or more
considering the Indianola. Miss, post
office affair, abd it was concluded not to
accept the resignation of the Cots wom
ac. but to continue the present arrange
ment unti Attorney General Knox has
Sifted te matter to the bottom, and
rendered a judicial opinion as to the
liability of citizens of that community
for prosecution tinder the penal statutes
of the United States, which the Presi
dent and Payne believe to have been
violated. Telegraphic dispatches from
Birmingham state that the Cox woman
positively refuses to accept the position
under any circumstances, yet despite
this fact the President: acting on the
advice oi Payne, Clarkson and Cabot
Lodge. is going to make tier do so.
willy nilly. This is a singular state of
affairs. The whole affair4is nnusual.
WHAT IS TH MEANING?
Never before in the history of this
government. not even .fn the celebrate]
kitchen cabinet of Andrew Jackson, has
so much time been devoted by the chief
magistrate of the nation and his cabinet
to so insignificant a matter. Now that
all of the facts are known, and it has
been ascertained dtat no violence or
tireats or intimid,}tion were used to
secure the resignation of the negro post
master, it would seem that a continu
ance of the star chamber investigation
would cease and that in these urgent
moments, when great issues are before
the nation for settlement, the President
would at least give as much time to the
consideration of them as he has to this
matter. The Colombian treaty, the Cu
ban reciprocity tr ty, the Venezuelan
question, the Ph ' ine legislation.
trusts and the coal situation, none Of
these, it can be stated with assurance;
have occupied near 2 mitch time at a
devoted at two sessions to this matter.

WHAT. IS THE MEANING?
Theodore Roosevelt has gone mrad.
The presidential virus is in his veins
When he lays him down tcr rest his last
prayer is for re-election. When he
arises in the morning his first request
is that Providence may guide him to a
second terme in the White House. Every
act is based on this. Every word he tit
ters has its birth in this idea. Not a
scientific politician, his reputation for
courage having to be sustained, his past
record for independent action in every
matter being ever before him, he has
woven a web that is fast winding its
meshes around his body, and before he
is aware of it he will become so entan
gled that the power to extricate him
will be his own undoing.
He is the best hated man that has
occupied the presidential chair sinct
Andrew Johnson left it. Nowhere is he
held more in cdntempt, or hated with
more bitterness and venom, than in the
South. This is a rare condition. In his
college days at Harvard he associated
with negroes. There they were called
Mister, and there they had privileges
commensurate with his. Although by
birth half Southern. he inherited none
of the chivalric character of the South.
none of its patriarchal economy was
diffused in his-blood. none of its proud
cavalierly hold-up-your-head caste be
came his. At Cambridge he became im
hued with the narrow inverted views of
Garrison. Wendell Phillips, Sumner and
Lowell. As he walked about Boston h
saw statutes erected to Lincoln and the
negro, especially the one which is sup
nosed to represent the great statesman
breaking the shackles of the "down
trodden slave." By nature impulsive, by
education stienuous and hot-headed, his
patriotic inipulses1 when he had them,
were gathered around a poor htalf-beast,
half-man who; in less-than two centu
ries, had flowered cut under Southern
civilization from this state of savagery
to one of docile,- huthle contentment.
the most remarkable fact in all our his
tory.
THE NEGRO JN THE SOUTH.
He knewt not, or else he denied him
self the veracity of the fact, that it was
only in the South that the negro was
understood, and only there that be was
accorded the t nat that his condi
trait of life demanded. Aid he read the
history of New Ebgland he would have

weld the South.
s.6 le two complete progranm can be
innouced. three especially interesting
featurtes have been definitely decided
]pon 'by the local committee.
Ou the evening of the 14th there will
e a joint meeting of the convention
end the membe'-s of the Southeastern
Passenger Association, when addresses
will be made by Messrs. S. F. B.
Morse, passenger traffic manager of
he Southern Pacific: A. R. Hanson.
general passenger agent of the Illinois
entral railroad: S. H. Hardwick, gen
,ral passenger agent )f the Southern
ailway, and C. L Stone, general pas
eger agent of, the Louisville and
Niash% ille railroad.
These gentlemen have given the best
rears of their life to the railroad pas
senger service of the United States and
hey are working as a unit in an effort
o increase the population and wealth
)f Louisiana. Texas and Massissippi.
't can positively he stated that all the.
gentlemen will be present, and with
hem will come the men who are at the
read of the great immigration and ad
vertising departments of the several
:ailroads.
During the afternoon of the 15th the
iisitors will be given a trolley ride
,vhich will present a splendid opportun
ity for them to become better <ec
luainted with the city of New Orleans
in which each and all have an interest.
The people of Louisiana. Texas and
Mississippi realize that New Orleans
is the pulse of the South, and they all
rejoice in the magnificent prosperity
she is enjoying.
On the evening of the t5th the del
:gates will be invited to attend the
nonthly meeting of the New Orleans
Progressive Union, when an- address
vill be delivered by Prof. E. L. Cort
'ell accompanied by splendid illustra
ions of Argentine. and this will be
>articularly interesting as ivery citizen
)f these three states desires so becomhe
miore familiar with all of the country
Ro the South of us, and this is partieu
arny true now that the isthmian canal
is considered a certainty.
Thanks to the progressive and enter
arising newspapers printed in every
section of the states ot Louisiana. Texas
md Mississipipi. many people have be
:ome advised of this meeting, and com
munities which formerly were without
zommercial bodies are organizing them
so that they can be represented by dele
gates at the New Orleans meeting.
An interesting feature of the monthly
meeting of the New Orleans Progress
ive Union will be two-minute talks by
gentlemen from different portions of
.he three states, and those talks will be
particularly interesting to the great
business commnnnity in New Orleans
which composes the membership of the
Union.
The local committee is as follows:
George H. Smith. chairmap: T. F. Cun
