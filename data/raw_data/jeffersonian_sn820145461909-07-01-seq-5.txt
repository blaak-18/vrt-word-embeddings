The Dust of Bloom
By R. A. Myers

N THE sun-scorched plain
grew naught to ease my
burning, restless eyes. I
had wandered long and the
first touch of fatigue began to numb
my limbs. My shoulders ached be
neath their heavy load, and I felt a
great desire to halt and ease my
weary frame. But as I tarried by
the way a brawny figure stood be
hind me and bade me linger not, but
to press forward, and I hastened
along lest nightfall should overtake
me and my task remain unfinished.
The way was rough and my feet
were torn, and great drops hung
from my brow. But on I went, the
brawny Old Man ever keeping his
place behind me, urging then com
manding.
And no sound came across the sand
but the steps of the Old Man follow
ing mine.
At mid-day a faint shadow rose,
afar beyond me, and in a whisper of
breeze I thought I smelt the dust of
blooms, faint but sweet. But it
passed, and I thought I had had a
dream; and I fixed my eyes on the
path before me, looking ever down
ward, and with all my strength pro
ceeded.
After a long time I looked behind
me. There came the Old Man, but
behind us both lay our shadows, and
I knew then that the day waned. I
thought with delight of the approach
ing night-time and I said to my soul:
“Thy burden will be lighter in the
cool darkness of the night..”
And again I thought I smelt the
bloom on a faint wind.
And I looked up then, and far, far,
beyond us grew a tiny palm tree that
shook its frounds tn the sunshine,
and my heart was glad and I bent all
my strength to reach the little tree,
for it seemed sweet to my sight.
I said naught to the Old Man, but
he laughed softly to himself as I
quickened my fast-failing steps, and
he prodded me with his staff. May
hap he saw the palm, and was glad,
also.
On and on, over the great, wide,
hot desert we traveled, plodding
along, wearied, bleeding and torn and
worn with heat.
Then the sun slipped down over
the edge of the world and the grey
dust of darkness sifted down over us.
A few golden, rosy clouds floated
over his pathway, but these soon
faded, and when they were gone it
was too dark longer to see the tree.
All night we walked and worked.
The silence was like a tomb, and the
only glimmer of light was from the
stars that hung above us.
No word, no sound, no cessation
of the long journey, but onward,
ever onward the dreary night
through. But twice came the odor,
and each time I thought:
“There must be a land of bloom to
which we journey, a land of sweets
and of peace.”
But I spoke no word, and toiled
on.
Then dawn came and with its first
beam I began to strain my eyes for
the palm, and at last sighted it still
Under the Vine and Fig Tree
far, but, oh, so tall now, and I
thought again:
“Ah, at noontide I shall reach it.
1 shall lay me down in its shade and
rest.”
And when noontide came I raised
my face to the sun, and then I fal
tered, for I was exhausted, and I
knew I could do no more. And I
looked for the Old Man and he was
far behind me, farther than ever be
fore, and I said to my soul:
“I will stop; I can go no farther.”
To the Blue Ridge Mountains
Farewell! but not for long; I come again to thee!
Blue, heavenly blue, are thy far distant hills,
And distant far the heart that turns to thee;
Never were siren songs or beckoning arms from sea-washed isles
More soft-alluring than thy waving lines,
Tender, ineffable, mysteriously fair.
One who has long-time breathed the rarer breath
Os thy sweet air, fresh from the winds of heaven,
That thrills as mildest wine the pulsing blood,
Or dwelt beside thy forests broidered fine
With myriad blooms all rosy-flushed like dawn;
Loved thy primeval hemlocks and thy pines
And thy great laurels in the shadowy ways,
Glistening with silver light beneath the moon;
Heard the wild merry plash of mountain streams
And wakened to the fluting u-o-lee
Os brown wood thrushes answering to the morn:
One who has climbed thy lofty mountain tops,
Sat with creative powers a little space
And seen the home whence wandering clouds go forth;
Watched the sharp lightnings flash from peak to peak,
The chasing shadows and the shifting lights
Play on thy granite walls and verdant slopes,
Until the eye most gently led along
Doth rest upon the wide unnumbered waves
Os distant hills, so like unto the sea.
O, such a happy one,
Who has for long years since thus lived with thee
And loved thee thus, may say to thee farewell
But for a time: the soul that leaves thee now on wings of haste
Will be drawn back to thee again, as wandering bird
Returns to chosen haunts while life doth last.
Thou fadest from my sight;
Home, love and distant hills all melt away
In softest lines of heavenly blue.
Farewell, O dearest hills, but not for long;
My heart turns still to thee; farewell, I come again!
—Mary Chapin Nmith.
Before me tall and straight stood
the tree that had seemed so small in
the distance. It grew solitary yet
fresh in the great desert I was in,
and a wind came over from the south
and shook its leaves, in the shade of
which grew green, tender grass and a
-bush that bore sweet blooms. Their
dust lay scattered over the green and
their fragrance was the same that the
wind bore to me over the sand.
I left the path and stood in the
shade, but in my halt I had forgotten
the Old Man, and he had overtaken
me and now began to urge me for
ward again, and with a groan I start
ed once more.
At first his rugged old face had
seemed comely and kindly to me, but
now after our long walk together it
’Blje

was hideous and frightful, so that I
would not look upon it but upon the
sand as I started. He prodded me
with his staff and I began the toil
again.
I turned for one last look at the
birds that fluttered near, so happy
and free, and, 10, under the tree sat
a figure with arms outstretched for
me, and her voice fell full and strong
upon my ear:
“Come,” she said, “why seek you
further?”
And I said to myself:
“Yea, why?’’
But the Old Man said:
“Tarry not. Press forward. There
is more to do.”
And I was bewildered. I knew
not which way to turn. And they
each urged me, the one reached her
arms toward me, and the other prod
ded and goaded me. Then I said in
an uplifted voice:
“I will do what is best, and I will
stay. I have worked and toiled long
and hard. I have come a long jour
ney and I have accomplished much.
True, there is yet much to be done,
but another will come this way and
complete what I have left undone. 1
am very tired. I have finished my
task. I will stay.”
And the woman said:
“Stay.”
And as I turned to speak to the
Old Man 1 saw that lie had passed
on, and with that he vanished from
me forever with my burden on his
back, and 1 was free of him, and laid
me down to ease and peace.
And a great shower of forgetful
ness fell upon me, and when I awoke
this calm, majestic woman stood
over me, with her fair face full of
light and warmth.
And she looked steadfastly upon
me, and I grew strong.
The shade of the palm was sweet;
the song of birds was music; the
rustle of leaves in the fresh breeze
was soothing, and the bloom-dust
that filled the air was delicious; but
better than all, and sweeter and more
pleasing was this strong figure be
side me. And I closed my eyes, and
remembering the long, hard journey
I had come through, I thought:
“This is worth all the toil.”
And the woman spoke to me:
“Tarry and linger with me. I
give the greatest of all blessings.”
And I nestled to her side, and my
head lay over her tender heart, and
the peace was very sweet. And I
asked:
“Who was the Old Man who fol
lowed me and goaded me and drove
me over the plain, and has now with
my burden left me forever?”
And she looked after him the way
he had gone, and she spoke his
name:
“Ambition.”
And I fell asleep again, and when
I awoke her calm, true eyes, not wan
ton eyes, looked into mine. And her
strong, true heart beat over mine.
And her face, perfect in its beauty
• and its truth, hung over me like a
star. And, oh, the bloom-dust was
sweet, but sweetest of all was she.
And after a long time I said:
“Tell me your name.”
And she bent, over me close, and
said in a voice like unto the music
of falling water to the ear of a thirs
ty man, so Lliat it seemed that I
d reamed:
“Rest.”

TO CLEAN LIGHT WOOL SKIRT.
To clean light wool skirt take one
pail of warm water. To this add one
pint of gasoline and one-quarter bar
of naphtha soap (dissolved). Put
the skirt to be washed into this and
wash carefully. Rinse in water the
same temperature as water used in
washing skirt. This is an excellent
method and never fails to make skirt
look like new. —Texas Farmer.
