SPOIL the Business. ,
By putsing a well-displayed,
=well - c structed advertise
ment in the local paper, you
can bring your goods to the
notice of every buyer in town.
.Then if you have something
which the public need, good
iesults will be forthcoming.
It was a wise man who said:
"Leave nothing to what is
called ' luck' and you will
generally be what is called
*lucky.. " So in advertising.
Secure the best advertisement
obtainable- the one of all
others that will be most like
ly to bring you business.
Then see that it goes in the
4 - local paper, and you will
probably find that will have
"'good luck" in advertising.

A HOPEFUL STRA W.
Saturday last, at the sale of the
effects of the estate of the late Emile
Creighton, some two hundred acres
of land, including one hundred
planted in cane, was sold for
$10o,5o0.
Immediately after the sale, a
gentleman, who seemed to be on
inside remarked to the gentleman
owning the adjoining property, that
his future ease is assured, implying,
it is believed, that the erection of
a central refinery would follow the
sale. And so it will likely prove.
Mr. Ferris and others are inter
ested in the move. So that the
people may reap some of the bene
fits certain to result from its opera
tion, it has been decided to form a
stock company, capitalized at $200oo,
coo, divided into 2,000 shares at
the par value of $xoo each. The
main promoters desire the people to
subscribe $25,0oo of the capital
stock, in money or kind, that is, a
planter can take stock and pay Sx
on every ton of cane, on account,
that he may bring to the mill, which
will be placed to his credit and
payments continue until such in
stalments aggregate the amount of
his stock. For instance, suppose
he sells his cane to the factory for
$4 a ton gross, he will pocket $3
and leavt 81 to place against his
stock, thereby becoming a co-owner.
And right here we want to inject the
observation that at $3 a ton there is
more money in cane than in cotton
at 1o cents a pound.
The principal idea in asking the
people to subscribe to some shares
of the capital stock is more in the
nature of a desire to have the people
feel some personal interest in the
matter than anything else.
Mr. B. A. Salles has been author
ized to solicit subscriptions to the
stock, and has met with much en
couragement, and thinks the out
look very fair for the realization
of the amount.
The Ferris company are offered
fine inducements at two other points
to locate, but prefer the neighbor
hood of this town, if not on the
Creighton tract, then in the vicinity,
because the natural advantages ad
jacent thereto utilized will make the
mill a paying property.
Plans and specifications, we un
derstand, for a o800 tons a day mill
has been contracted for, and the
only question confronting the peo
ple of Lafayette at present is wheth
er they want this plant or not.
It has been suggested that a mass
meeting of the people, under the
apspices of the Business Men's As
sociation, be called at an early date,
and in day time, when addresses in
French and English be made upon
the subject.
There is one thing, we believe,
the majority of the people of Lafa
yette are agreed upon, And that is
the demand of the times is for a
central sugar refinery, and it is fur
ther thought it would pay a hand
some profit on the outlay, and add
i.- the growing desire of our farmers
-. engage in the cultivation of the
%.,ugaz cane, it would prove a paying
station to all.

eria Enterprise in
. Or'Cade's candi
tment as superinten
dent of the mint, at New Orleans, to
has this to say: a
Hon. Overton Cade's appointment gi
will be well received by both wings gi
of the Democratic party in this ai
State; it is in fact the placing in
high positions of such men that will
wipe out the dissention, of the past. te
Then, again, he is of that sturdy Â«
material and scrupulous honesty to L
whose keeping the affairs of the
country may be safely entrusted,
with the assurance that they will t
be administered with the same care,
economy and exactness that charac- tl
terizes their own private interests. r,
This merited tribute will be ap- s.
preciated by the hosts of friends of
the gentleman in Lafayette parish, I
his home. It is true, as observes s
the Enterprise, that it is in the h
hands of just such men that the af- e
fairs of the country should be
placed. Having made a success of -
his personal affairs, it is safe to as- a
sume that the same care will be n
given to public trusts.
Mr. Cade has been honored by h
his fellow-citizens, and he has never g
proved derelict in the least to the b
trust confided to him, hence, to- fl
day, enjoys the respect and confi
dence of the democrats of both fac- a
tions that were engaged in the late p
political campaign. b
We are assured that his candi- h
dacy is favorably regarded, and
with the proclaimed endorsement of ii
our two senators, and other influen- c
tial men he is more than likely to i;
get the appointment, and if he does n
Lafayette parish will be gratified fi
beyond measure.
I A swindler is sending out from
r Chicago circulars advertising a steel 14
engraving of the "Landing of Co- P

t ries, but it is a steel engraving all s
right. The fraud is said to be reap
ing a rich harvest.
TIHE GARDEN SPOT. t
The beauty which characterizes J
the scenery of Southwest Louisiana, s
is no where more perfect and I
_ grand than in Lafayette parish--the r
a Carengro region on the one side,
and the Cote Gelee hills on the s
other-has been pronounced by
travelers superb and that it rises to a
the majestic in its splendid grandeur.
1 But beauty aside, you see a hap- t
, py and well-clad people, denoting
contentment and prosperity. L
But prosperityaside, you see prairies t
that are covered with luxuriant wild t
1 grassses, whose nutritvie and lasting
- qualities permit a range for cattle I
hat furnishes sustenance winter and
e summer, where the cattle need no I
r housing in winter, and are general
ly sleek and fat.
s But, range facilities aside, you see
lands susceptible of the highest de
e velopment, lands that will produce
s several crops in nine months.
But fertility of the soil aside, you
see a hardy, healthy looking people
e who are unacquainted witht hose ail
ments so common in the north
e consumption, asthma etc-thus
e denoting a salubrious climate.
But salubrity of climate aside,
you see a population, who a few
years ago, in their manners and
e customs, presented a picture of
foreign admixture, to-day this same
population is abreast of the times,
n and this is due to the educational
facilities keeping step with the de
d mand of the times.
ts Thus this section combines every
r- adlvantage for the establishment of
e prosperous and happy homes.
Men who are willing to rely on their
Sown energies, exertions, and means,
eand do not expect a fortune in a
year or two, will find an ample re
ward, and will succeed in making
Sfor themselves comfortable homes.
e That splendid paper,the New Ibe
- ria Enterprise, has changed its form
1- whereby it is enabled to devote
more space to home matters, but
is that is the only change, for that
e graceful style and care to details
s- that has characterized the writings
e, of its able editor is still maintained.
n It is deserving of the fine patronage
,n it is receiving, and The Gazette
trust that it will go on prospering.
e, THE CA THOLIC CENTEN
a
NIA L.
s From the published reports in
the city papers we glean the infor
mation that the centennial of the
Catholic Episcopacy in New Or
Id leans, was celebrated with magni
ficent and imposing ceremonies.
Te he Times-Democrat notes that
ig dignitaries of the church '.from all
Sparts of theUnion, and even from dis
tant Canada were present to honor
the second oldest diocese in the
United States. How great an event
it was, the presence of twenty-three
in archbis.hops and bishops. including
i- the American Catholic primate,
a-('ardinal Gibbons, shows." And
the Picayune says, *"they made up g
a notable assemblage, and their ti
gathering'marks an era in the pro- g
gress and civilization of this city
and State." g
The speeches partook of the his- a
torical and retrospective, and to a s'
,"review of the Catholic church in c
Louisiana, and its connection with n
the important events that have t'
taken place in this time." r
Gov. Foster was an attendant at
the imposing ceremonies, and to a
reporter of the Times-Democrat
said: p
"I consider the celebrations that
I have witnessed this morning," he
said, "to be the finest the South a
has ever had in the way of church C
exhibitions. I cannot express my
felling in regard by what I have'
seen, further than to say that the t
Holy Roman Catholic Church, with i
all its impressive services, has I
never exceeded the mass held in the
Cathedral this moring, and a more
eminent body of priests and prelates I
has rarely been convened in the 2
South. As for the sermon of Arch
bishop Ryan, I think that there are I
few, if any, bishops in the Ameri
can church that are his superiors '
for eloquence, grace of delivery
and range of intellect. He is a su- I
perb type of the Roman Catholic
bishop, and I enjoyed listening to
him."
The educational chart, prepared
in order to define the best features
of the education institutes of Louis- I
iana shows the following as the
number of schools, although the
figures will have to be raised some.
Here are the figures:
White public schools, 1518; co
lored public schools, 727; white
private schools, 446; colored pri
vate schools, 75; Catholic convents

ABO UT Tl.E SUNDA Y LA IV
The subjoined is an extract from
the address of Henry L. Garland,
Jr., delivered before a crowded as
semblage of ladies and gentlemen
last Monday, in Washington Artil
lery Hall, New Orleans :
Touching the Sunday law, there is no
statue upon the books which is more defen
sible upon principles of justice. It is a stat
a ute enacted in the interests of the working
people of the city and State, so as to guar
>antee to them by law what they co,uld not
expect their employes to allow voluntarily.
Through the Sunday law the strong arm of
the law intervenes to protect the po1 r work
ing people from the rapacity, greed and
tyranny of organized capital. . The I.egis
lature of the State would have no right to
enforce the Sunday law against Jews. and
those who are not Christians or wh > do not
l believe in the Sabbath, if- the Sundlay law
was designed to enforce the observation of
Sunday as a religious holiday, but the truth
is that the Sunday law is designed to set
aside Sunday as a day of rest-and to make
of it, so far as the law is concerned, a pure
ly civil institution. And as a civil institu
tion only, it is perfectly defensible upon any
conceivable ground. That one day out of
the week is needed for repose of b.Idy and
e mind is a proposition which will be scarcely
denied by any intelligent person. The rush
- and hurry of our life, the complex nature of
our civilization, the servere strain to which
the human system is subjected in the fierce
struggle for existence, imperatively deman-l
that a fixed day for repose and rest shall
afford that relaxation which the high ten
e tion of our mode of life imperatively de
mands. If it were not for the virtue of our
women and the beneficent effects of such
institutions as the Sabbath,are garde:l purely
as a civil institution, it would not be many
s generations in the present fierce struggle
for existence before the American people
wonld degenerate into a race of idiots.
It is useless to argue in support of laws
w which are so manifestly beneficial. That
d they cannot be enforced without trouble,
without much effort, is no argument against
,f them. Nor should the dificulty of enforc
ing them deter the people from demanding
e their enforcement. The police are paid for
, this work and should be made to do it. WVe
must remember that there is nothing that
is very desirable that is come by easily.
Most good things are the fruits of severe toil
of serious effort.
Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.
y Intellectual activity is the source of intellec
tual life. Moral activity is the cause of
moral life. Physical activity is the source of
Sphysical life. And in our munuicipal life,
our municipal improvement will be the re
r sult only of activity and vigilance on our
, part.
Obedience to the laws as written, whether
a they are bad or good, is the only safety of
- the republic. Toi allow any clas:s of citizens
to say that this law shall be enforced, and
g that law shall be successfully defied, is to in
. vite anarchy.
The American people are a law-abiding
people, and deep down in the popular heart
there exists a firm resolution that all the
n laws shall be enforced without fear or favor.
it Tell a farmer of the West that it
t is possible to raise four crops in
Is nine months on the same piece of
, land in Lafayette parish; tell him
. the cultivation of three quarters of
ea century, without an ounce of fer
:e tilization has made no change in
Stheir productive capacity; tell him
that these lands seem to be abso
lutely inexhaustible; tell him there
are many acres that can be bought
*n for twenty-five or thirty dollars an
- acre, and he is pretty apt to think,
ie if he don't tell you, that you are ex
r- aggerating. But you know that you
- tell him but the simple truth.
, A FE TCIIINVG IVt Y.
S The subjoined article is not only
s- timely,but contains such strong logi
r cal deductions from ascertained facts
me that we gladly give it space. it is tak
at en from the South,a publication de
te voted to the material interests of the
g South, published North and largely
e, circulated over the entire countiry:
TI "1"o sccutre inmmigration the it::lii
grant must be attracted. The at- at
traction should be manifold. The th
greater the inducements the great- of
er the numbers that are sure to fe
come. The character of the immi- ti
grant will be measured by the char- le
acter of the inducement. If a rich a,
soil is offered, the agriculturist will f,
come. If the climate be mild it e
ill call both those who are accli- a,
matized to a genial temperature and rr
those who for physical and other T
reasons wish to escape from a cold sa
one. If there be grand forests the tc
lumberman, will come. If there be c,
minerals, men who delve in mines cl
or those who see wealth in mineral is
pursuits will come. ti
But there is another attraction o
which transcends the magnetism of d
material force. Is is the attraction i
of kindred and noble natures.
Men will respond to an invitation
which is cordial and persistent when
they would turn a deaf ear to a
heartless and formal one. An ap
peal which is earnest insures a re
sponse, and when the immigrant a
arrives, if he is welcomed with
gracious hospitality, and if ther
after he is not treated as a strange
within the gates, he will become a
permanent dweller in the land. H t
will do more than this; he will be -
coine a part of it and will contribute
to its wealth. His coming thus de
pends upon those who have prece
ded him, who presumably have
found it a goodly spot in which to
dwell, and who desire the compan
ionship and the co-operation of
other good citizens.
To invite a guest without wishing
him to come is bad conduct, but to
invite him and then treat him with
anything less than perfect honor
and justice would be harsh, indeed.
His rights should be rigidly pro
tected and the same good fellow
ship should be extended to him as
he would be expected to attend to
the stranger coming to the land
from which he came. And if he*n
receives this treatment his residence
wWill not only result in material ad
vancement, but it will bring his -
friends, and thus a strang move
ment and tendency will result.
Character determines the value of
an immigrant. If his life has been
one of thrift at home, if he has by
integrity and industry built fortune
and fame, these same qualities will b
attend him wherever he goes.. - If
his life has been one of toil, even f
if it has not been crowned with
large wealth, his value as a citizen
and as a contributor to the sum of
the wealth of a community may be
far greater than that of many who
have acquired worldly goods in
large measuire. The producer is he
who employs rich natural resources
with intelligence, skill and labor
and extorts from them their great
est possibilities. Having done this
i he may be trusted to devote the
fruits of his labor to the best uses
Men like these are the creators of
iprosperity and wherever they dwell
they leave their impress upon the
State in deeds of enduring renown.

fMilson in his immortal poem, 'Paradise
SLost," writes "*Order i- hC.avcn's first law."'
,f Our knowledge of the material world veri
t fies this assertion, for the solar system is
maintained in infinite space by the un
c uhangeable "'first laws" allude.d to. Thus
we sec that the laws formulated by omnipo
tence and infinite wisdom for the governing
h of the universe are founded upon *"order."
We likewise see in all human undertak
y ings, whether in government or business en
e terprises, that success is attained only by
e obedience to and compliance with certain
s well defined powers'delegated to a ruler or
Lt head. Who can estimate the anarchy and
confusion that would follow, should every
t individual tundertake to impress his pecu
liar ideas upon those who are placed in au
r thority to carry out a specified object ?
e Among all the institutions established for
it the promotion of the public welfare, there
ii is not one in which "'order" or system is
more essential than the one having for its
r- object the extention of education. Every
school may be likened to a government;
Sthe teacher being thie ruler and the pupils
, the subjects: th2 former must necessarily
- ie an autocrat, which inmlilies absolute obe
dr lience on the part of thie latter; in order to
r accomplish this the teacher must have the
f co-operation of the patrons, without whose
aid there can be no complete success. In
n my last communication I made a general ac
cusation of the neglect of duty of paren's
g as patrons of the public schools, but now I
ri shall bring a direct specification, by stating
that I cannot call to mind one instance in
which a parent has inq uired "does my child
t or do my children obey you?" 1 do not Ie
liyeve there is in Lafayette parish a parent
n who made such an inquiry during the year
S 892z of any public school teacher. If there
m is one who did, I will pay one year's sub
)f scription to The Gazette if he or site will
r- present himself or herself at the office of
The Gazette. I hope the person making
the claim will leave a photogralph of the one
Sso appearing, for I would like to see such a
- rare specimen of humanity. Nine tenths of
e all the serious troulmles that occur in the
t school-room in the supervision of youth re
sult from slicer disobedience of the pupils;
the teacher receives only indirect aid to
meet this ever present evil. It is claimed
- that the reason the pages of Grecian history
u are adorned with the names of so many
scholars, orators, philosophers, poets, law
yers and historians of learning and worth is
because of the untiring watchfulness and
strict supervision over the youth during
their school days. Not alone as to their
collegiate acquircmcnts, but as to their
ts morals also. If parents would manifest as
k- much interest in the educational advance
e ment and deportment of their childlrcn at
school, as the care which they bestow upon
their chickens, pigs, calves and colts they
w ,uld find it more prolitable, and I am sure
i-ren'ic-c~t as the f. miwls .amat1 aumiinnuls f'.mr the_
attention given them. I am not questioning
the lack of parental affection but pointing
out an evil-a serious omission as seen and
felt by the professional teacher. The lat
ter is expected to make of the pupils col
lectively, what the parents have failed to
do individually-that is to make them duti
ful, respectful, truthful, to counteract the
evils of erroneous training, and to round off
and polish characters that have been made
rugged and unsightly by vicious example.
There are always many prompt to criticise,
successful in misconstruing, ready to listen
to false accusations, but slow to approve and
commend. It would be unjust to make this
charge universal in its application but there
is enough truth in it to annoy the conscien
tious teacher-the one who has some other
object than the making of a few hard-earned
dollars. WVith such undeserved natures a
little undeserved censure far outwcighs in
pain the pleasure of much praise.
