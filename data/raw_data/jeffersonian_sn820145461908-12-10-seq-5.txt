LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
A LOYAL WORKER.
■Aquilla, Texas, Nov. 22, 1908.
The Jeffersonian, Thomson, Ga.:
I see a great many of the readers
of The Jeffersonian are ill favor of
organizing at orifee, but don’t say any
thing about the money to pay the ex
penses. I want to say to the readers
of The Jeffersonian that Mr. Watson
has been badly treated, not only by
his enemies, but his friends. He has
made this great fight single-handed,
but few of us have given him any
Substantial aid. He has spent the
best of his life working to better the
condition of the common people, for
which he has been ridiculed, perse
cuted, ostracized, but he is the same
Tom Watson now he was twenty years
ago. All the difference we can see is
he is more determined than ever. He
can’t be bought and can’t be bull
dozed. Comrades, think of it!
Twenty years of persecution and still
unmoved, still true to the common
people. He is out more money on
this campaign than all of us put to
gether, to say nothing of his time.
It is a shame for us to let him pay
his expenses. If he will furnish the
gray matter we ought to furnish the
hash. We cail’t all be great men, but
Ave can do good work in a great, a
righteous, cause if we will only find
the part we are capable of doing and
go at it. I want to propose a plan to
the readers of The Jeffersonian. If
you are opposed to it,' say so. If you
are in favor of it, say so. It is this —
that each one of us send Mr. Watson
one dollar (let those who can send
more) to pay him the money back he
is out on this campaign and to help
build a publishing plant so he can do
more effectual educational work. If
Ave will give him the substantial aid
and the encouragement there will be
something doing. Look what he has
already accomplished. One by one
he is forcing the twins to adopt our
principles, and if we will do our part
he will force them to adopt our money
plank or go out of business. Then,
and not until then, will the farmers
get relief. We owe it to Mr. Watson,
we owe it to our country, we owe it
to our wives and children to do this.
Then we can go to work in our own
State and raise a fund that will
frighten the privileged class. We will
never miss what we put in the work,
it will be as bread cast upon the
waters. It will encourage Mr. Wat
son. he will feel that we appreciate
what he has done for us. Now, boys,
there is nothing to it; we have got to
fight the devil with fire. Just a little
from each one will do the work. How
many of you are willing to send Mr.
Watson one dollar or more by the
first of January? I will head the list
with two dollars, wish I could send
more.
Now I want to ask every reader of
The Jeffersonian not to fail to work
for subscribers for both papers. If
they come slow, don’t get discouraged;
you will soon learn to pass the fool
and then your luck will change.
Youi’S in the work till the summons
comes,

APPREHENDS ANOTHER BRYAN
FLOP.
■■■a
Little Rock, Ark., Njv. 13, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Watson: “We met the ene
my and we are his’n.” The elimina
tion of Bryanistn (if he is eliminated)
is good for the cause of Reform. Any
man that wears the Dolly Varden
dress of so-called Democracy, under
guise or pretense of being a reformer,
is a first-class fraud, fool, or hypo
crite. Modern Democracy is a regu
lar bologna sausage affair. No one
can tell its component elements, and
Mr. Bryan is a fit leader for such an
organization—-always leads it to de
feat. As a leader of such a hoodlum
gang, he has earned the gratitude of
the country, he has already shown,
by his recent editorials, that he may
be laying his plans to mislead Re
formers again.
He has a penchant for flopping,
and® we may not be surprised if he
flops back to his position of 1892-’O6.
If he does, it will be a difficult mat
ter to fool Populists any more.
Truly yours,
A. W. Files.
AS TO FUTURE PLANS.
Royston, Ga., Nov. 30, 1908.
Dear Mr. Watson;
Replying to your favor of recent
date will say that, while your letter
needs no reply, I feel that it might
not be amiss to write you briefly in
regard to reorganizing the party. As
you suggest, it might be well to await
developments, however, I cannot but
feel that if we are going to reorgan
ize, the sooner the better. Os course
I feel that it is asking too much of
you to lead the fight, and yet we have
no leader without you. You have
sacrificed so much for the people, and
in a measure they seem to show so
little appreciation, that no one would
censure you if you gave up and let
them go. I, as well as thousands of
others, know that you could do much
more for yourself and family to de
vote your entire time to your own
affairs. Yet to do’ so would leave us
without a leader. In my opinion the
•next four years will be the time for
Jeffersonians to hustle.
Bryan will again be a candidate of
the Democratic party. He is daily
losing popularity. Taft’s administra
tion will be a failure in many respects.
Times are going to be harder than
ever. Public sentiment changes more
rapidly now than ever before and if
we can succeed in organizing ourselyes
into a militant working force, per
haps form a coalition with other re
form movements, we stand better
chance to become balance of power
than ever before. As to plan of rais
ing funds allow me to suggest for
your consideration a plan something
as follows: Begin now to agitate the
reorganization of Jeffersonians under
some other name than POpulist, as
soon as practicable call a meeting and
elect young, active men to take charge.
Let these men send out call for per
sonal contributions, not once, but
make them send out urgent, insistent
Ueffersonldn
calls day in and day out, keep work
ing all the time. Send out an organ
izer of Jeffersonian clubs, let him
cover the entire field, lecturing and
taking up collections at each place he
lectures. Let him distribute reform
literature and appeals for contribu
tions. A hustler could thus secure
enough to pay his personal expense
and salary and put good amount into
the funds for other purposes. One
good live hustler could do this work
in each State. My observation has
been that good hard work done long
before a campaign opens counts more
than spasmodic efforts just before the
election. I have already made this
letter too long, and I fear it will take
too much of your valuable time. How
ever, allow me further to say that
whatever course you may pursue I
am with you heart and soul as long
as you battle for the people’s rights.
With best wishes, I remain,
Yours very truly,
T. G. Dorough.
QUOTES SOME “MIGHTY GOOD
POPULIST DOCTRINE” FROM
ATLANTA JOURNAL.
Atlanta, Ga., Nov. 16, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson:
For the first time in life I ask
space in your impartial paper for a
few brief remarks.
Being well aware of the fact that
I am a very feeble writer, I always
try to content myself by reading
after others. But since the election of
November 3rd strange things have
met my gaze, in the way of editorials,
in other papers.
Therefore knowing, as I do, that a
great many people who read The Jef
fersonian do not read the daily pa
pers, I desire to quote from one of
our leading dailies —The Atlanta
Journal: “It is simple candor to say
that the South has no one to blame
but itself that Democracy has fallen
upon such evil days.
“From the very beginning the effec
tive force of Democracy has rested
with us. The ‘Solid South’ has
become commonplace. We have been
hewers of wood and drawers of water
for the party as a whole so long that
no one has given us a thought.
“We must no longer allow ourself
to be held in contempt. We must
write the platform, according to the
principles of true Democracy, and
name the candidate who is to go be
fore the people.
“As conditions exist today, we com
promise with the alien elements of the
party, accept the candidate dictated
to us by other sections of the coun
try, permit ourself to be led by the
nose, and wake to disaster, as we
have just done.” -
Mighty good Populist doctrine for
the Journal, isn’t it? Any one who
has ever heard Mr. Watson make a
political speech, or read after his
able men, knows that he has for the
last fifteen or twenty years been try
ing to teach the people that these
were facts.
But instead of meeting with co
operation with a majority of the peo
ple, and with the press of the South,
he has met with hisses, hard sayings,
howled down in our own capital, and
many other unpleasant things.
And now what do we see? Papers
which have fought him the hardest,
after being “led by the nose” for a
quarter of a century have been made
to open their eyes to the situation as
it really is. We also see the Journal
says: “The seventeen thousand who
voted for Watson in Georgia were
his political pallbearers.” I am
proud to say I was one of the num
ber, and had a thousand times rather
be the “political pallbearer” to a
true Georgian than the pallbearer to
a product of Illinois.
We do not think Mr. Watson has
had his political funeral yet; and feel
sure that he will demonstrate the fact
in the not far distant future.
Jeffersonian Democrat.
A SPLENDID LITTLE WORKER.
Conyers, Ga., Nov. 18, 1908.
Mr. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I received the Bible, No
vember 16, in good condition, and I
am well pleased with it.
I thank you for your offer very
much.
I like to read your papers fine. I
am a little school girl of thirteen
years of age. Papa takes the weekly
Jeffersonian and the monthly maga
zine, too. He says he doesn’t
want to be without either one, he says
they both are certainly good papers.
His name is Z. C. Baker.
I sure am glad of such a present as
a Bible like the one I received, from
getting up a club of 5 subscribers to
your paper.
Very respt. yours,
(Miss) Minnie Baker.

REFORM PROSPECTS ARE
BRIGHT.
Barnesville, Ga., Nov. 12, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Nir and Friend: I thank you
for the noble fight you have made for
our dear old Southland in the last
national election. I do not see how
any old Confederate veteran could
have voted against you. Yet many
of them did so. All because they be
longed to the dear old Democratic
party just as effectually as the tail
belongs to the dog that wags it. The
dear old Democratic party is now
dead, and it can truly be said,
For helping the rich to rob the poor
She has passed away to come no more.
We will now have a party of Jef
fersonians against the Hamiltonians.
The common people will begin to
think for themselves and, with the
name Democrat out of the way, they
will vote for principle. The prospects
for the reformer are brighter today
than ever before. Mr. Watson, we
feel proud of you. Through your no
ble efforts we have the negro dis
franchised. Through your noble ef
forts the State of Georgia owns a
farm to work her misdemeanor fibn
