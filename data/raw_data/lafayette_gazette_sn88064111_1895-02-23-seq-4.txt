trlets. electrie traction lines for coun
try and city alike, and improved pave
ments for cities have been discussed
on all aides by private eitizens and by
legislators. Ten years ago the steam
railroad, the growth of little more
than a generation, was pointed to with
interest as a cause which had revolu
tlonised the world. For in modern
times the transportation of freight
and of passengers is the most impor
tant business of humanity. The idea
of the steam railroad was the creation
of large units of transportation. Great
trains of cars bearing several hundred
passengers became the railway man
agers ideal.
The steam railroad seems to have
reached pretty nearly its limit, and
now a most formidable competitor for
local trailc has come upon the scene
in the electric r6ad. The five and six
car steam train is supplanted by a
nuipber of single trolley cars run at
frequent intervals.
These matters the capitalists have

ties, and very'directly the individual
For on roads and streets the horse
drawn vehicle and the bicycle travel,
and the latter, once a toy and now an
everyday vehicle, is a principal cause
of the new agitation. With good
roads all over the face of the country
and with proper city pavements a new
field of work for the inventor at once
is open. The horse is being more and
more relegated to the background.
The bicycle surpasses him in its
powers of transporting humanity. It
illustrates the immense reduction of
friction on journals by the use of ball
bearings. After ball bearings had
V settled this part of the- problem the
rolling friction difficulty was solved
by the pneumatic tire, and the bicycle. wi
in great measure a perfected type of fra
machine, is going into universal use. ris
t In France recently there has oc
curred a competition between road tir
c vehicles driven by power. From the wl
early days of this century repeated ef- in
forts have been made to produce a
I road engine. To the existence of this ,
e machine a good road surface isessen- of
tial. France is peculiarly adapted to th
its introduction on account of her lm
good roads. There the bicycle is in
r universal use, and the power-driven
e road wagon may become a part of the t
machinery of transportation, a
In the United States, with cobble- di
stone pavements, and with sandy and tr
muddy roads disgracing city and coun
try alike, much has to be done before
the work of producing a successful
traction engine or carriage can be ac- o
Scomplished. But the production of r
1. the bicycle has done much to facilitate
progress, and has solved so many of
:5 the mechanical problems of the perfect
Âºt road vehicle, that it seems a pity that
a the power problem cannot also be s,
) solved. The motor is now what is m'
wanted. It must be light. The bicycle
of twenty-five pounds weight carries a tl
two hundred pound rider. The motor px
is carriage of the future must be light. ar
S With good roads all through the
" country traversed on bicycles by every.
one, and with power-driven vehicles in
for freight, in place of~horse and wag
or on, the life in the country districts el!
)y would be revolutionized. Daily deliv- dt
cry of the mail and of light express
,. matter would become practicable, and b:
ro the progress of the individual would m
a be favored. But until good roads come si
r this cannot be. The trolley road as an
'o. approach to the desired cheap traction
n, has proved welcome to the country
and suburban dwellers. The advent
1 of a practical power-driven vehicle
t. coupled with good roads would prove ni
m just as welcome and more in con- a
sonance with the vested rights of the
'$- community in such roads as they pos- a
