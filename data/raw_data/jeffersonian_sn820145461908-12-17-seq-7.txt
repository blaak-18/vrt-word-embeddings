THL HERO OT THE PEE DEE BRIDGE
Sy PK H. Andrelvs, Lt, Orderly Sgt., Co. Zs. First Ga. Regulars.
On the third day of March, 1805,
the aitny under Qerieral Wm. J. Uai
dee, Consisting of McLaws’ aiid Talia
ferro’s Division, crossed the Pee Dee
river at Cheraw, fi. C., and marched
out a few miles on the road and halt
ed, leaving on the Cheraw side Gen
eral M. C. Butler’s Cavalry and Col
onel Fiser’s brigade of infantry,
composed of the First Georgia Regu
lars, sth and 6th Georgia Reserves
and the 27th Georgia Battalion, be
tween eight hundred and one thou
sand men.
On the 28th day of February the
brigade was ordered from Cheraw to
Chesterfield, about twelve miles south,
where we were posted at the bridge
on Clinch’s creek, north of the town.
On the first day of March the regu
lars captured three men belonging to
Sherman’s 17th Army Corps, and on
the second the corps entered the
town, and during the evening a warm
engagement took place across the
creek. About nine p. m. the brigade
retreated towards Cheraw, halting a
short time before day to rest, then
up and on again until we were within
three miles of town, when we halted
for a couple of hours and cooked and
ate our breakfast. We Avere waiting
for Butler’s Cavalry, which was
somewhere in our rear.
When we started again it was on
the double-quick, as Sherman had
three army corps nearing Cheraw—
marching on different roads, and our
safety from death or capture de
pended on crossing the river. When
we reached Cheraw we filed to the
left down the street, which, after go
ing three-fourths of a mile, led to a
cross street about four hundred yards
from the bridge.
When the brigade was about half
way the regulars were halted, while
the rest of the brigade crossed the
river and joined the troops on the
other side. We about-faced and
marched back to the Chesterfield
road, where the right of the regiment
was halted and the left formed in
line of battle in an old railroad cut
parallel to the road. It was only a
few minutes until we were engaged
with the enemy across a small field,
and in a short time Butler’s Cavalry
came thundering down the road, filed
to the left and on through the town,
and as they disappeared down the
street a Federal regiment was seen
about one hundred yards to our left,
charging over the railroad cut mak
ing for our rear.
A retreat was ordered and the left
rejoined the right and we started
down the street on the run, with the
Federals at our heels, loading and
firing as we- ran. As we fought
through the streets we could hear,
above the reports of our rifles, the
screams of the women and children,
all of them waving something white,
which seemed to enrage our color
bearer, iSergeant Bennett, who would
yell: “You may wave your rags and
newspapers, but this is the battle
cross. ’ ’
'As the regiment entered the street
to the bridge and filed to the left two
pieces of artillery, seventy-five yards
to our right on the same street, open?
ed fire with canister. Holy Moses!
The regulars were catching it hot and
heavy from all quarters, but we never
looked back, or took time to gay “you
are another,’* but made for the
bridge, preferring death to capture
and a Northern prison.
I always thought that when I got
in a tight place I would feel small,
but I felt then like I weighed ten
thousand pounds, and like my back
was as large as a barn door, expect
ing every minute to have it peppered
with canister as thick as bird-shot.
Before reaching the bridge the
street entered a bottom, where the
men could not be seen from the bat
tery, but they could see our flag and
were bursting shell in our ranks.
Captain Dußose ordered Sergeant
Bennett to lower the colors, but he
swore that he would die first, and
then he would not. The regiment
then filed to the left, around a block
of buildings, and back into the same
street a.t the bridge, which was wall
ed in and covered over, with rosin
strewn on both sides, and with sev
eral cavalrymen ready to fire it as
we passed through. When we were
about half way, the Federals entered
the bridge in our rear and we fought
through it. When we left the bridge
the enemy ceased firing and turned
their attention to putting out the
fire.
We entered a Targe field, extending
at least one mile to the woods. From
the bridge the road inclined down
the river for about two hundred
yards, then gradually turned to the
left. The boys were staggering along
the road, trying to recover their
breath, thinking that their troubles
were over, for the day at least.
When we reached the bend in the
road, General Butler dashed up and
asked for the commanding officer.
After crossing the bridge Colonel
Wayne had galloped on to the front,
and the ranking captain was pointed
out to him. “Wheel your regiment,”
said General Butler, “and charge the
bridge. The Yankees are putting the
fire out.” The captain told him that
the men were completely exhausted
and unable to make the charge. But
General Butler told him that the
bridge had to be taken, for if the
enemy succeeded in putting out the
fire all would be lost.
As the regiment wheeled to the
left a battery of six guns unlimbered
on the bluff below the bridge, and as
the wheel was completed the first
shell passed through the ranks, tak
ing off the leg of Sergeant Charley
Bruce, of Company I. The regiment
was ordered to charge, but instead of
charging the bridge charged the bat
tery. General Butler dashed up and
down in the rear of the line, ordering
the men to bear to the right and get
the bridge between them and the bat
tery, but by that time all six' guns
were bursting shells in our ranks and
the men made a dash for the river
bank, where they would be protected
by the friendly trees.
Believing that to obey the order
of General Butler was the correct
thing to do, I dropped out of the line
and made to the right and the bridge

at the same time, several more of the
boys doing the same thing. After
passing the right of the regiment the
enemy saw our move and knew our
objective point was the mouth of the
bridge, where one rifle would be
worth more than five hundred below
it, and two or three of their guns
were turned on us. Sergeant Alex
Clemency, the Orderly of Company
G, was shot five feet in front of me,
when a shell struck the ground be
tween us and exploded. The explo
sion staggered me and hurled me
back, covering me with dirt,- and
blistering* me with smoke. As soon
as I could straighten up I started
forward through the smoke, and
stumbled over Alex, who was lying
at full length on his face, with his
arms in front, dead, as I supposed.
He was the only dead man whose
position I ever envied, and I could
not help saying: “Alex, poor boy,
you are dead but you are better off
than I am.”
I again moved forward, intent on
reaching the mouth of the bridge, or
dying in the atempt, while the shells
were trying to lift me off my feet.
The bank of the river on the Che
raw side was twelve or fifteen feet
higher than on the opposite side, and
there was a plank-way leading from
the mouth of the bridge to the road;
and as I reached that, Alex overtook
me, he having fallen into a hole in-
Drifting Upon the Rocks of Romanism
Sy John P. Austin.
I notice in a recent issue of the
St. Louis Republic an article emanat
ing from the facile pen of His Royal
Highness, Theodore Roosevelt, writ
ten to one, J. C. Martin, of Dayton,
Ohio, in which he, with his usual ar
rogance and unbridled effrontery,
champions the cause of Catholicism
• and flings the gauntlet of defiance
and insult in the face of American
Protestantism.
He, as we all know, is the only
President who has ever degraded the
high office given by the people by
taking an unwarranted interest in
the presidential campaign.
He doubtless apprehended that if
he had flung his defiance and insult
in the face of Protestantism that
the American people would have rele
gated his protege to some other vo
cation than of the Chief Executive
of the United States.
He says: “When you say that no
Protestant would vote for a Catholic,
you insult your fellow country
men.”
Let us see if he does. Our greatest
statesmen, our greatest patriots, our
greatest thinkers, our greatest moth
ers were Protestants, were they not?
Let me quote from one ex-priest.
Unless we guard our American liber
ties with Protestant patriotism, it will
not be long till we find our govern
ment face to face with a problem
•more perplexing than the government
of France has recently had to deal
with.
Who assassinated Lincoln? A
Catholic, and he was hid more than
stead of being killed. We started
up the plank-way together, and
when high enough to see through the
bridge, we. halted, transfixed as it
•were, to the spot, with our eyes riv
eted on one lone Confederate soldier
trying to rout the enemy from the
bridge by himself. He was a Cap
tain, and must have belonged to But
ler’s Cavalry. He was about thirty
feet from the mouth of the bridge,
firing away at the enemy in the oth
er end of the bridge Avith his pistol
as coolly and deliberately as though
he had a thousand men at his back,
Avhile his horse was lying dead a few
feet to his right.
To me there is nothing on God’s
green earth grander or more sublime
than to see a brave man offering up
his life, a willing sacrifice for the
love of home and country.
There were times during the war
when a man vrould be compelled to
perform some brave deed or be called
a coward; but this soldier’s act was
voluntary, as he could have left the
bridge Avhen the rest of the command
did.
Alex looked at me with the fire*
of battle flashing from his eyes, as
much as to say: “Billy, I think
that he needs a little more reinforce
ments”; and we dropped on our
knees and crawled to the mouth of
the bridge, where we were joined by

a week in a Catholic church. Who
were the other conspirators? Har
old, Powel, Mrs. •Surrat, Dr. Ward,
and Laughlin, all Catholics. Let us
quote from the Catholic Telegraph:
i ‘lt will be a glorious day for Cathol
.ocism when, under the laws of jus
tice and morality, our public school
system shall be shivered to pieces.”
And again from Inland: “We can
have the United States in ten years
and 111 give you three points: The
negroes, the Indians and the public
schools.” From Priest Schawer;
‘ ‘ The public schools have produced
nothing’ but thieves and blackguards.”
Isn’t that enough to cause any
Protestant to pause and give a reason
why he should not vote for a Catholic
president? Can we, should we, will
we, as patriotic citizens, vote for
such results although our president
so strenuously insists that we should?
I, for one, will not.
The public school system is the
cradle and nursery of our liberties
and they and Protestantism have
made our country second to none on
earth.
Let us look for a moment at the
condition of a few countries under the
dominion of Catholicism. In Ecua
dor seventy-five out of every hundred
are illegitimate. Italy, the home of
the Pope, is the most immoral coun
try on the face of the earth. Russia,
with the Czar at the head of the
Church, is the most cruel and heart
less government on earth.
