GEORGIA LA WYERS ON I
L YNcHING. t
The subject of lynch law has c
been much discussed by the news- f
papers throughout the Union lately. 1
Especially in the Southern States.
h~as this mooted question received }
the attention of the public r
journals. With few exceptions edi- s
tors south of Mason and Dixon's I
line approve the lynching of negro
ravishers. In Georgia the other t
day the State Bar Association met
and some of the best minds of that a
commonwealth, discussed the ques- j
tion whether or not black brutes c
who ravish white women should be t
lynched. Hon. Hal. T. Lewis, an I
eloquent and distinguished son of
the Cracker State, led the fight in
favor of giving the endorsement of
the bar association to the lynching
of the wretches, and we are glad to c
say that the sentiments so forcibly r
and beautifully expressed by the a
fearless Georgian, were unquali
fiedly endorsed by other lawyers of a
equal prominence. All honor to r
those gentlemen for daring to give I
an honest expression of their views )
on this subject, for there are
Southern men, who at heart share
the same opinion, but have not the t
moral courage to speak it out, for
fear of incurring the displeasure of c
Ida Wells and a few howling cranks
in the North who have not the re
motest idea of the social conditions
that prevail in the South.
It may be alright for Judge
Baldwin, of Connecticut, and other
long-distance sociologists to coolly
inform the Southern people that the
-law of evolution is at work upon I
the negro," and "that with the
facilities for schooling which the
laws everywhere extend to him, the
eradication must be steadily and 1
gradually effected." i
But while the negroes are in this I
evolutional state, what are
the white men of the South to do ?
When the negroes will have reached
that degree of advancement which
Judge Baldwin tells us will be the
result of education and they will
cease the perpetration of that horri
ble crime upon defenseless victims,
then, and not before, will- the
Southern people cease to lynch
them.
Mr. Lewis, who, by the way, is the
gentleman that nominated Bryan at
Chicago, spoke as follows:
"'Lynchings in Georgia are al
most invariably the result of horri
ble outrages perpetrated upon help
less and defenseles women. Is it
because the people are apprehen
sive that such a culprit, with proof
of guilt, would escape punishment
if left in the custody of the law?
No one doubts that under our sys
bem as it stands his conviction
would be assured. Is it because an
unreasonable delay in trial and exe
cution is apprehended ? No one
doubts the readiness of any judge in
Georgia to call a special term of
court in such cases whenever the
welfare of society demands it. Is
it because of an unusual spirit of
lawlessness among the white people
of Georgia that they perpetrate or
permit mob violence ? I dare say
that the criminal record of this
class of her people will compare
favorably with that of any State or
,ation on the globe.
*"Why, then, is lynch law more
frequently practiced here than in
the North and West ? It is because
the crime to which we have referred
is more frequent here, and the dan
ger of its perpetration greater. He
that supposes this evil can be cor
tcted by legislation simply does
not understand and apppreciate the
situation, especially in our rural
districts. This crime is committed
by the negro, and, strange to say,
he selects a white victim, as if his
brutal passion was fired with an ele
ment of malignity against the Cau
casian race.
"*The laboring farmer -often has
to leave his wife and chilaren at

reach of help. When the news of

a -criminal 'at l'=arge is aotit tiobe
dreaded than the most. feroc¬4usC
beast that ever roamed' the forest,
that he places himself beyond the~
pale of the law and I not entitled
to the benefit of either law or
clergy. b .
"He is:.lynohed because h~hlic oa
tim should not be alloWed .the "
further humiliation of detailing a c
crime which she-can hardly whisper d
to her husband or breathe to her o
parents. He is lynched because of M
the conviction in the. public mind
that this is the most effectual way a
of prevenlting a repetition of the of- o
fense. He is lynched not because 9
lynchers have less regard for law
and order, but because they have
more concern for the sanctity of n
home and the pintection of its- in- F
mates. To attempt a correction of s
such a sentiment by statute would
prove as futile as an effort to over
come the fury of the cyclone or to
prevent the lightning flashes from a
the stormcloud." st
These sentiments were indorsed
by such men as Col. Thomas, Hon.
W. C. Glenn, and others, and only C
called for one spirited speech on b
the other side, from Col. N. J. t
Hammond, formerly member of
Congress from the Atlanta district.

ing Judge Allen for delegate to the s

ablest journalist in America, is se- I
riously ill at his summer home, WVest
Island Dosoris. Mr. Dana is 78 1
years old.
It is very amusing to read how
some Democratic papers explain 1
the fact that they are not in favor
of protection, although they think
Senator McEnery is eminently right
in voting for the Dingley bill.
They do not want to be known as
protectionists, yet they are giving
their support to the Dingley bill.
In the coarse of an able editorial
supporting the stand taken by Sen
ator McEnery, the St. Mary Ban
ner remarks: "This article must
not be construed into an approval
of a protective tariff." Will the
Banner please tell us what kind of a
tariff is proposed by the Dingley
bill ? It is surely not a free trade
measure ?
Mark Hanna is the head and
front of the National Republican
party as it exists to-day, the power
behind the throne, the President, in
fact, although McKinley is per
mitted to wear the title and to do
the drudgery oft the office. It was
Mark Hanna, who at the Toledo
convention, killed the strong and
emphatic declaration fn favor of
recognizing the belligerency of
Cuba, and it was Mark Hanna who
in the caucus of Republican sena
tors last Thursday, killed the anti
trust amendent to the tariff bill.

July x6 will be press day at the
Ruston Chautauqua. Hon. John
Dymond, of the Louisiana Planter,
has been asked by the management
to preside on that day and it is to
be hoped that all members of the
press who can be at Ruston on press
day will not fail to be present at
the Chautauqua.
` The Chicago Inter-Ocean pays

great day of their reunion at Nash
ville. The followers of Jackson
Sand Johnson and Lee are as enthu
1 siastic admirers of their great
warriors as when they marched and
fought for the 'Lost Cause.' They
e were great soldiers, and the men
- who followed them were hard
s fighters-the Union veterans bear
e willing testimony; but the war days
Sare over, and Old Glory will find,
in all the years to come the Blue
s and the Gray shoulder to shoulder
-ready for defense. In that is the
Sbeauty of it all."
