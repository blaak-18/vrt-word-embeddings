During the scholastic months the

It's makes -a man feel good to

A Born Reporter.
We were standing at a street cor

advancing at lightning speed. The
poor driver was thrown from the
vehicle, but before he had reached
the ground, a gentleman standing
near-by remarked in an excited
manner: "There goes an item for

Acting upon instructions from
Sheriff Bland of Orange, Texas,
Sheriff Broussard arrested l-ist Wed

Miller wanted in the Texas town
for murder. The next morning the
sIheriff received information that Mil
ler had been captured and the sus
pects in jail here were released with
the exception of two negroes upon
whose persons had been found con
cealed weapons. The proper affi
diavits were made against them and
they will likely spend the summer
as guests of Jailer Billaud.

Judge A. C. Allen, he distin

fell in among his Morgan City
friends Monday and had quite a
job to cut loose from them and re
turn home. We made two attempts
to cage him in the Costello hotel,
but when he said bench warrant we
got frightened and let go. Judge
Allen will be his own successor in
1896. Why not? He is able and
popular and is loved by the people.
-Morgon City Voice.
It seems to be an accepted tact
that Judge Allen will be re-elected
judge of his district, which Is com
posed of St. Mary, the Legislature
having made a separate district of
Vermilion and Lafayette parishes.
Judge Allen has presided over our
court for the past three years and
it is doing him but simple justice to
say that he has discharged the du
ties of his high office in such an
impartial and able manner as to
challenge the admiration of the
bar and public.
An Exciting Chase.
Last Wednesday afternoon just
when the Alexandria train was en
terirg the yards Sheriff Broussard
saw two negroes jump off the train
which was running at very fast
speed. This singular action of the
negroes naturally aroused the sus
picions of the sheriff who mounted
a horse and proceeded in that di
rection. Immediately upon seeing
the officer the negroes took to their
heels in opposite directions. By
this time some parties among whom
were Deputies 3illaud and Mouton,
were attracted to the scene and
started in pursuit of one of the fu
gitives while the sheriff followed the
other who was finally captured in
Dr. Mudd's field. During the
chase the sheriff fired one shot
which cut through the fleshy part of
the negro's left arm. The other
negro who had taken a westerly di
rection was brought to bay in Mr.
Sanders' yard. Before surrender
ing he drew a knife but did not use
it as he was soon overpowered.
They were taken to jail where they
gave the names of AIb. Williams
and Geo. Scott. As it was ascer
tained by Sheriff Broussard that
they hailed from St. Landry, they
were transferred to Sheriff-Fontenot
who happened to be in town.
The Fair at Carenero.
The festival given by the people of Caren
cro under the'lead of their energetic pastor,
Father Laforest, did not prove on Saturday.
* as great a success as was anticipated because
of the very inclement weather prevailing on
that day. Later in the evening the skies
cleared and a small but appreciative au
dience was present at. the-excellent concert
prepared for the visitors.
Sunday morning being bright and beauti
ful proved a gala day for the town, and re
warded the workers of the -festival for the
disaPpointments of the previous day.
The fair opened after the High Mass on
Sunday and was patronized by large crowds
during the day, and this was especially ap
parent as the hour drew near for the delivery
of the lecture upon *"The early days of
Louisiana" by Archbishop Janssens. His
theme proved to be one of great interest to
the people of this section, and was listened
to with great appreciation by the audience.
A number of visitors from Lafayette, Ope
lousas, Sunset, Scott, and Breaux Bridge,
who had come to the lec'ure, remained dar
ing the whole afternoon, and were present
at the concert at night. The scene presented
in the new church, where the fair took
place, was a beautiful one, for when the
Southern ladies assemble in t ieir airy sum
mer costumes no one could find the sight any
thing but charming. The whole building was
beautifully decorated under the supervision
and by the usual good taste of Mr. Geo. E.
Brown, and each booth rivalled the others
in its dressing of vari-colored flowers, chi
nese lanterns, moss, evergreens, and bun
ting in gay abundance.
An amusing feature and at the same time
a profitable one for the church fund was the
auction sale with Mr. Louis G. Stelly as
auctioneer; his stentorian voice and ready
wit, supplemented by the bargains which he
offered, drew crowds around him.
The refreshments were good and sold at
reasonable prices-and altogether it was a
successful and pleasant entertainment, and
it is in order for the people of Carencro to
thank those who came from distant towns to
assist them in their work. Especially are
our thanks due to Messrs. Wm.Campbell and
VanderCruyssen who assisted at the concert,
and to the Lafayette Gazette and Advertiser
for appreciated favors. The following la
dies and gentlemen made up the the enter
tainment, which would have done credit to
a place of more pretension than our little
town. Mrs. Chas. Jeanmard, Mrs. George
Melchoir, Misses Loulie and Emma Jones,
Miss Berdie Palmer, and several pupils of
Miss Madeline Melchior's school; Messrs.
Ed. Laberge, Louis Stelly, Geo. Melchoir,
and Master Weston Tlrown. Much amuse
ment was created by a comedy entitled 'Les
Prunes" enacted by Messrs. Stelly and
Laberge; Master Weston Brown made quite
a hit by the singing in costume, of the two
popular songs, "L)on't you think I'm pret
ty" and ,,Won't you be my sweetheart."
The different tables and their attendants
were as follows: "Restaurant," Mme.
Felix Benoit, Mme. Ernest Broussard, and
Miss Ida Arceneaux. "'Ice Cream and
Cake," Mrs. Octave Couvillon, and Miss
Celina Couvillon. "Tombola" Mrs. D. A.
Dimitry, Mrs. Geo. E. Drown and Mrs. A.
Cheffer. "liar," Mrs. Esteve Breaux and
Mr. J. George Chachere. -'Ice Cream and
Cake," Miss Aphelia Broussard, Mrs. Victor
l)upluis, Miss Lucey Bernard. "Coffee
cake, fruit and candy," the Misses Prejean.
"General refreshment table" on Church
Grounds by Mr. and Mrs. L. H. Prejean. !
Music was furnishing during the day by the
Carencro band.
Considering the hard times, the day's
entertainment proved a financial as well a
social success, and a great help to the good
cause which Father Laforest and his par
ishioners have in view.
Father Laforest has the good fortune of
enjoying the confidence of his people, who
can but appreciate the zeal and devotion
which he exhibits in his determination to
build for them a church suitable for their
needs. May success attend him. D.

Mosquitors are plentiful.
We are getting our share of the forty day

In this enterprising community, the high
priced flour question is creating quite a sen

up to the merchant's price, which is not a
standard one, then take what he can get for
his produce, often gives it away and then
pays the railroad for hauling it out of sight.
VWe think, MIr. Editor, it would pay better
to make laws just now, than to grow crops.

unexpected, was a blow to tl.e family and
a large circle of devoted friends. Mr. Ioff

BUR(GLARS
Effeet an Entrance in MILr. Pions
ky's House Thlursday Night.
Two negroes, Edward and Vil
lere Arcenaux, are behind the bars
of our parish jail charged with hav
ing burglarized the home and store
of Mr. Leon Plonsky Thursday
night. Early Friday morning
Sheriff Broussard was informed of
the bold act of the robbers the night
before and he,. immediately started
to work upon the case which re
sulted in the arrest of the two ne
groes, into whose possession were
found articles thought to have been
stolen. A pair of trousers and a
white fan were found in the neigh
bors' yards, the thieves having
dropped them in their haste to es
cape as Mr. Plonsky had been
awakened by the noise. Mr.
Plonsky says three watches were
taken, and probably a number of
other thin s were carried away but
he is unable to say of what descrip
tion they are. Sheriff lroussard is
till, 6ngaged looking up the case
and itis safe to say that the guilty
ones will soon be caught in the
meshes of the law.
It is Mrs. Plonsky who first dis
covered that there was a burglar in
the house. She was awakened dur
ing the night and toticed that the
light in her room had been sudden
ly put out, and rushing out of her
bed to arouse the other members
of the family, she saw the form of a
man and heard the noise of his feet
on the floor. By this time Mr.
Plonsky was up but before he could
use his pistol the burglar was out of
sight.
Since writing the above Sheriff
Broussard has come into the posses
sion of facts that establish the
guilt of both Edward Arcenaux and
his son Villere, and Leonce the
young negro who has been in the
employ of Mr. Plonsky. This
morning the sheriff visited the home
of the Arcenaux negroes and found
a number of articles some of whic:h
proved to be the property stolen
from the store of Henry Crouchet
at Carencro on the 27th of April.
The sheriff found the following in a
valise: a pair of shoes, a pair of
pants, a pair of gloves, a pair of
gray pants, a blue suit, two rings,
three cravats one bottle of cologne,
all of which were recognized by
Messrs. Plonsky and Crouchet.
1Vh.n confronted by these evi
dences of guilt young Arcenaux
confessed all, but the old negro
pretended to know nothing of the.
thefts and when questioned closely
by the officer gave several contra
dictory answers. In the course of
his confession the younger Arce
naux stated that he had secured the
key of Mr. Plonsky's house from
the little negro Leonce for a pron1r
ise of fifty cents. The latter was
subsequently arrested and put in
jail.
It is fortunate that Sheriff Brous
sard has succeeded in ferreting out
these audacious thieves who will be
fore many moons be in the service
of the State. The sheriff has con
ducted the investigation in this
case as to make the escape of these
bold burglars an impossibility.
Marriage.
Thursday afternoon St. Peter's
church at Carencro was the scene
of a quiet but very pretty wedding,
when Rev. Father I.aforest united
Mr. Claude F. Latiolais and Miss
Antonia Melchoir ijt marriage
A large number of friends of the
young couple were present.
The organ was presided over by
the talented musician, Mrs. Geo.
Melchoir. At about half past six
o'clock the wedding party ad
vanced to-the altar to the strains of
the wedding march played on the
organ. Miss Emma Duhcamp the
maid of honor becomingly attired,
and Mr. T. M. Olivier, the best
man, were followed by the bride on
the arm of her uncle, Mr. C. (:C.
Brown. The bride was most tastily
dressed and looked lovely in her
beautiful marriage costume. Then
came the groom who was acconm
panied by his sister, Miss Latiolais.
The group presented a most charm
ing picture. During the ceremony,
Mr. LaBerge sang an appropriate
song. After the ceremony the
l)arty left the church to the strains
of Mendelssohn's march.
The Gazette joins the many
friends of the happy couple in the
expression of the fervent wish that
their voyage on the sea of life will
be a pleasant one.
