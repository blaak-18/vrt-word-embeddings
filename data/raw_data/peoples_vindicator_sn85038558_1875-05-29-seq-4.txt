WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOE 1875.
Champion Ameriean Comic Paper !
t Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
can artists, aind contributed to by the
most popular humuorists and satirists of
t the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfully up
t on the sixth year of its existence, and I
has become the established humorous and
satirical paper of the .country. It was
started and continued the first year as a I
t monthly, then, to satisfy the demand of
the pulblic, it was changed to a fortnight
t ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
the political and social shams by its I
Smasterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater success than
before, and was recognized as thl ablest E
and brightest of itsclass. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public I
demand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its E
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
ing the first successful weekly humorous I
paper ever published in this country.
. Among the artists especially engaged
to furnish illustrations for Wild Oats are
t" Frank Bellow, Thomas Worth. Hopkins, I
SWales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels,
Stuekhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to fame. 1
In its literary departnments Wild Oats i
will, as it always has, stand alone and E
unapproachable. At least one first-class 1
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
a and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
f will be sparkling, original and pointed. I
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be I
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
' will appear that can offend the most fas- I
tidious.

Dr. J. Walker's California
YinegavrBitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VIXEGAR IT'
rRnst" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of Vii
HOAR BITTERs in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
