A Lonely Grave.
That afternoon I found something A
I had never seen before-a little gra
grave alone in a wide pasture which Bos
had once been a field. The nearest wbt
e house was at least two miles away, A g
but by hunting for it I found a very was
0 old cellar, where the child's home ly a
must have been not very far offalong Ii
h the slope. It must have been a great Gul
many years ago that the house had a =
,i stood Ithere; and the small slate elgl
head-stone was worn away by the foul
rain and wind, so there was nothing to I
to be read, It indeed there had ever true
been any letters on it. It had looked Ass
g many a storm in the face, and many ton
a red sunset. I suppose the woods
:9 near by had grown and been cutand D
grown again, since it was ut t dre. b
There was an old sweet-brier bush
o owing on the short little grave, and
i. the grass underneath I found a wee
4 ground-sparrow's nest. It was like a
1- little neighborhood, and I have felt con
ever since as if I belonged to it; and E
d I wondered then if one of the phis
q" young ground-sparrows was not day
[ always sent to take the nest when eip
Sthe old ones were done with it, so fore
they came back in the spring year old
after year to live there, and there yea
! were always the stone and the sweet. and
>r brier bush and the birds to remem- Joy
the child. It was such a lonely rett
le place in that wide field under the usu
a- great sky, and yet it was so comfort.- a
able too; but the sight of the little of b
_ grave at first touched me strangely, T
:. and I tried to picture to myself the Kr
procession that came out from the stu(
house the day of the funeral, and I in tJ
", thought of the mother in the evening w
e after all the people had gone home ,is
and how she missed the baby, and tha
n kept seeing the new grave out here by
it in the twilight as she went about her fro,
work. I suppose the family moved the
I- away, and so all the rest were buried nev
h elsewhere. erni
I often think of this place, and I noi

a phis celebration suggests the anTlent
day of thanksgiving of the Puritans,

Three able St. Louis lawyers,

studied the question of Indian's rights

I agree in an opinion that all the land

that, as the Territory was acquired

r from the Indian tribes, the title to
I the part now occupiediby Indians has
I never been relinquished by the gov

3 The extent of the emigration from
I Oermany to this country at the pres
p ent time is not geperall known, but
it is a fact that the German emi
grants arriving during August were
1 more numerous than those from any
' other European country. The whole
I number of foreign arrivals during
Sthe month was 58,972, of whom 6974
° were Americans returning, 249o were
t aliens not intendinog to remain, and
5 50,508 were immigrants. Of these
i 639e came from England 6157 from
Ireland and 1814 from Norway and
I Denmark; 11,918 came from Germa
" many, and 1722 from Austria and
° Hungary. There were 13,506 Immi
t grants from Canada, the greater part
s of whom doubtless had come origi
t nally frm Great Britain and Ire,
land, but even counting them all in
d this class the English-speaking im
migrants are hardly one-half of the
ý whole.
