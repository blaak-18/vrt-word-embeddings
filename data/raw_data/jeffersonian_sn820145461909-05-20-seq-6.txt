LETTERS EROOT THE PEOPLE
STARTING RIGHT.
R. F. D. No. 6, Lewisburg, Tenn.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.*
Dear Sir: Enclosed you will find
i one dollar bill, for which please set
my time ahead six months to your
magazine and weekly. I cannot do
without your two roost interesting
and instructive periodicals. I get
more information from your magazine
and weekly than from all other publi
cations I have ever read.
I am a Populist from the crown of
my head to the soles of my feet, and
regard the principles that you advo
cate as being the soundest since the
days of Jefferson, Calhoun and others.
You are right on the foreign mis
sion question, as you are on a’l others.
Mr. Wat son, I am a poor boy, but 1
intend to do all I can for the cause.
T aim to die a Populist in principle;
for I believe our platform of princi
ples is as near perfect as imperfect
human could possibly make it. I am
with you to the end. You have already
done enough for the common people
to deserve the praise of the universe.
Long’ may you live. Your friend,
R. L. Compton.
FOREIGN MISSIONS.
R. F. D. No 2, Thomaston, Ga.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.:
Dear Sir: Yours, sir, is the posi
tion of the sentinel on duty, alert and
ever watchful of the maneuverings of
the enemy. Your exposition of the
inner-workings of this foreign mission
fallacy has created something of a
stir among the prelates, etc., those
high-salaried fanatics. But we say,
‘‘Well done, thou good and faithful
servant.” Be not afraid, —the Old
Guard is still true.
Evil politics, Catholicism and the
devil must be combatted at whatever
cost, and 1 know of no government
system more pregnant with these dan
gerous influences than our own. Still
there is no need of nor occasion for
missionary work here. Oh, no, our
system of religion and politics are as
near perfect as can be had, —so say
our learned dignitaries. But we know
it is monstrous, and there is nothing
more to it.
Your position relative to this for
eign missions question is w'ell taken,
and while you are attacking this end
of the system, the cannibals are eating
away on the other end, and soon mis
sionaries as food for these carnivor
ous creatures will become scarce in the
cannibalistic markets, and the credu
lous will not so easily be deceived by
the ecclesiastical alarmist in the fu
ture. John B. Gibson.
SHOWING THE NEED OF EDUCA
TION.
Pisgah, Ala.
Editor Jeffersonian: I am willing
to do anything I can to get the people
to read your publications. I have
been reading your paper the most of
the time since you published the Peo
ple’s Party Paper in Atlanta.
I think, Mr. Watson, there will
have to be some plan devised to get
the reformers -together. My opinion
is that direct legislation is the
course to be pursued. If a man or
party opposes the Initiative and
Referendum, it would be hard for
them to make me believe they were
in favor of reform.
If we should call a convention, in
viting all the parties that believe in
reform to send delegates, and if they
could -agree on Direct Legislation, I
think that would be sufficient at
present.
It certainly is a fact that we will
have -to -have the reins of the Govern
ment before we can do anything. If
Thomas Jefferson were resurrected
and made President, lhe could not do
anything with the present House and
Senate.
We must teach the people what the
Initiative and Referendum means. 1
•honestly believe that not one in ten
of the old party paper readers can
tell the meaning of such words as
these and “Imperative Mandate.”
In my opinion, the voter will have
to be educated, and as we have but
few reform papers, I tlhin-k it would
be a. good idea to have Direct Legis
lation explained in pamphlet form.
I would be willing to buy pamphlets
to supply every voter on my Tom
Watson mail route, and deliver them
in person, and request each person
to read and study the question.
If all hands and the cook will pull
together for the amendment of the
Constitution so- as to give ns Direct
Legislation we could then vote for
what we want, and against what we
don’t want, and each party could
’bring up its pet plank or planks, and
have them voted on their own merits.
Wishing you great success, I am
Your true friend,

DEPLORES LACK OF INTEREST
IN GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS.
Prescott, Ark.
Friend Watson: Things look blue
over here. The people are dead to
everything but -the individual struggle
for existence. I have tried to in
terest them in petitioning Congress
to put sugar on the free list, but they
are perfectly indifferent. We are in
the last stages of political ennui, it
seems.
We have a few men willing to
work for reorganization, but all of
them -are poor, and most of them
old, like myself.
I notice in “Letters from the Peo
ple” some still insist on changing
our name, and nearly all of them
want “Democratic” hooked on to it
in some way. Now do they stop to
think how this name would affect
men of the Northwest? Look where
Kansas, Nebraska and Colorado went
when we got mixed up in the fool
fusion deal with Democrats. A blind
man ought to see that either one of
the old names will act like a red rag
on a wild bull. How many men of
the South would go into -a reform
Republican party?
Wishing you abundant success, —
which you surely deserve, —I am
Sincerely your friend,

SIGNS OF THE TIMES.
I have been intensely interested
in Mr. Watson’s editorial summing
up of world conditions. Everywhere
there is crime, poverty, graft, dis
honesty, nameless evils and injustice;
debauchery, selfishness, religious, so
cial, civil and political unrest and
indicision and moral bankruptcy.
“Wise men shaking their heads.”
There are other conditions prevalent
that Mr. Watson does not catalog, but
no doubt sees. It begins to look as if
the whole fabric of our government
and civilization were about to go to
pieces, doesn’t it?
What’s the cause? Is ’there a
remedy? Is the remedy in Socialism
or Populism? Can either of the old
parties furnish the salve that could
cure our wounds?
But these hideous conditions pre
vail -all over the world —-not only in
these United States of ours, but,
look Where we will, we find the same
conditions —even to the wise men of
other countries likewise shaking their
heads I
Going, going, going to pieces.
It begins to look as if the civiliza-,
lions of ages are about to -tuauble
about our ears —-a seeming that grows
more real every year.
The remedy? Bear with me just
a little While I touch on an unpopu
lar topic:
Just before Christ’s crucifixion,
while preparing bis disciples for fu
ture events, he said: “I am going to
prepare <a place for you, and if I
go and prepare a place for you I
am coming -again.” John 14:2-3.
“And his disciples came to him pri
vately -saying, What will be the sign
of thy presence, and of the consum
mation of the age?” Matt. 24:3,
Mark 13:4, Luke. 21: 7.-
In answer to these inquiries Christ
then told his disciples what “signs”
would precede that momentous event
when He should “come again.”
Mr. Watson’s catalog- of universal
upheaval is but an epitome of world
events chronicled daily in the press
for a good many years past. The
daily press goes into detail. Mir.
AV at son condenses. But take notice
that the daily press’ details and Mr.
Watson’s epitome are a publication
of those “signs” chronicled in Mat
thew’, Mark and Luke. The daily
happenings of the world are the ful
fillment of our Lord’s prophecy,
“And when those things come to
pass, ye may know it is near, at the
very doors.”
Go over the Jeffersonians for the
past several weeks, then, while fresh
in mind, get out your testaments and
read the Gospel chapters indicated
above —just to see where we stand.
In tlhe face of such -a stupendous
event as the return of Christ to earth
with its contingent circumstances, is
it any wonder the kingdoms and gov
ernments, the political, religious, civic
and social world is in a state of
chaos? Is there a remedy? “In the
days of -these kings -shall the God of
heaven set up a kingdom which shill
to all eternity not be destroyed, and its
rule shall not be transferred to
another people.” Daniel 2:44.
Rost assured Mr. Watson is keep
ing us informed concerning rapidly
fulfilling prophecy, which further as
sures us that we are on the threshold
of another “age.”
“Be ye also ready.”
“Blessed are they who watch.”

CAN’T BLUFF POPULISTS IN
HIS PRECINCT.
Commerce, Ga., Route 29.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Enclosed find P. 0.
-money order, for which you will
please renew my subscription to
your two (2) Jeffersonians.
As for a conference, I have been
following your wise counsel for the
last twenty years, so it is up to you
to say w’hat we Pops had better do.
We earned our precinct by a large
majority last November. We have
got the Democrats so they don’t bluff
us in our district. We have over
300 voters.
May the good work go on.
As ever your fried,
James W. Wright.
GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP OF
RAILROADS.
Interstate, W. Va.
Dear Mr. Watson: Your princi
ples are right and practicable, but
it seems that the people will never
wake up until robbed of their rights,
—and then resort to the dagger, torch
and -bomb.
In my judgment the government
ownership of railroads is the one
thing needed as the basis for gen
eral reform. Until they are taken
out of private hands, and freight
rates made equal to all, as are post
age rates, there will be robbery, poor
service, and railroad influence will
continue to corrupt our courts -and
legislative bodies.
Unless there is a tremendous popu
lar demand, nothing in the way of
relief will be obtained from our na
tional law-makers. The pledge which
they owe to the people is subordinate
to that which they owe the Interests.
Ihe Interests dictated their nomina
tions and elected them, and a glance
at the personnel of the Taft cabinet
is conclusive proof that the Inter
ests are to be well served.
The recent corner in wheat, and its
resultant robbery of both producer
and consumer, -should arouse the
whole nation to the evils of the sys
tem, and the people should remember
that the system’s chief instrument is
the privately owned railroads.
I hope you will continue the fight.
Four years of Taft will, I think, thor
oughly, convince the voters that for
years they have been only the ignor
ant, but willing, dupes of those who
now have them at their mercy, and
will make a mighty effort to free
themselves from the clutches of
privilege.
Sincerely yours,
<>• Adkinson.
