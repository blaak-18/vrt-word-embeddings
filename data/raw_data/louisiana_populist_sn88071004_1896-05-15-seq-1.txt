The policy read is the one that leads

tried it-beginnting first on a mall

POPULISM MEANS IT.
THREE VITAL QUESTIONS THAT
DEMAND SOLUTION.
O0 Their Proper lolutito Depeeds the
Perpetalt y the Natlou-The Popa
Isre Party the only Party That meen
for the Beet Interests of All the People
Many unthinking persons have but
little idea of the true meaning and ob
jects of Populism. There are three vi
tal questions, upon the correct solu
tion of which depends the perpetuatien
of the nation, the security of our Insti
tutions and the happiness of our peo
ple. These are money, land and trans
portation.
Only one of the three great national
parties have taken a decided, positive
stand upon these three burning, living
issues, and that one is the People's
party. Now for the benefit and in
struction of those who seek for knowl
edge, the unthinking, and even the
prejudiced, we will enumerate some of
the objects of this rising young giant,
the new party of the "great plain peo
ple."
Popullsm means the complete anni
hilation of the Interest bearing bond
system, whether national, state, coun
ty, municipal, township or school
Populism means that `wealth, which
demands the greater protection, shall
bear the greater burden of taxation, in
stead of compelling the poor man to
pay all the taxes and exempting the
rich.
Populism means equality before the
law, protection to voters, and honest
elections. It means fair, but moderate
salaries, fidelity to trust, and distran
chisement for malfeasance in omce.
Populism means that every man and
woman who desires to work shall have
the opportunity of doling so, and at
mir living wages, according to ability.
It means that no one man, corporation
or company of men shall be permitted
by class laws to accumulate such vast
wealth at the expense of those who toll
lncesuanly for a mere subsistence.
Populism means the repeal of the an
tional bank act, and the issue by the
general government, on Its own credit,
the credit of the whole people, of all
money used.
It means that the volume of currency
shall be limited to so much per capita,
and shall be increasd oaly as the pop
ulation and business ncreases.
Populism means a postal savings
bank, and the closing forever of these
present swindling concerns called state
and national banks.
Populism mesas the restoration of
our convenient fractional paper cur
reney. out at which we were meanly
swindled 1r our modern fancial
Asanda.
Popalism means absolute death to
Sbeak stem of inflation and con
s10 o eg practiced, to the die
turbaneo and ruin of buaness, and
starvatlo f a the laborting people.
It mea seek a adf ntoteat of our
haancal systems as will make a gem
eal pania imposebhi
Populism mesas that no alien `hall
own land Ia the United States. It
meanthfat no landed monopoly or sys
tes at tenantry, serfdom such as ex
lets abroad, shall exist in the United
aties, but that there shall be a limited
swnr.shbp of land.
Popolism mesas protection to labor
a well as apital, in our home Indue
ries, and that noae but American clti
sea shall be employed in our mann
batotrs.
Populism means the government ean
tra at railroads, telegraphb and tele
phoes, sad n pore giving of sabe
lies, tlads, or speial privileges, o
baeahises, to grasping ndividuals or
