It is a goldbly argument that
. ly eight million silver dollars
werm coianed prior to 1873. But
Stlhy don't sy that that was all the
4d4lver money that was coined, nor
-ito theyL tell why no more silver
oIhllra were coined. The reason
ai s that the metal was actually,
worth three cents more than the
dollar, m they were at a premi
':e. That is, a ailver dollar was
4-fwth more tha, a gokl dollar.
the esme time over one hundred
blg~io dollars in maller coins was

According to our," neighlbor's

The writer assures us that he
does not intend his ladvice for an
office-soeker. This displays more
sense than we thought he possess
ed- but having followed the trade
of oftice-seeker all his life, he
knows they never take anything
but office, not even free advice.
Secondly, he assures us that his
advise is not intended for the fel
low who "has read Coin's Finan
cial School." Agiain he surprises.
us with his shrewdness, for the
fellow who has read that hook
woult set him down as far back as
the Ape, in l)arwin's theory of evo
lution, and therefore he avoids
him.
Thirdly, he assures us that he
does not address himself to the
man who "hasn't got any reason
ing m(Whine." Correct again, for
the man who uses brains instead
of a machine would hardly see any
beauty in the machine-made argu
ment or advice of that article.
Not having read "Coin's Financial
School" the writer of that article
is still gratuitously dispensing his
machine-made ideas, blissfully ig
norant of the fact that (oin's pic
ture of a banker pulling the strmg
to that machine is a photograph of
his own little self.
Our reason for using the masca
line pronoun herein, is that many
have told us that the author of that
article is not the fair editress of
the Enterprise, but a lawyer-officer
in this city, who prefers hiding be
hind a woman's dress to coming
out openly, or even assuming a
nora de plume.
But assuming the authordship of
that article as the Enterprise does,
will materially assist the silver
people in placing the Enterprise
where we have all along believed
it would go--into the Goldhug or
mnahine-thin in column.

D Democratic p)r'ty V
What has the ke'mocr:itic party
done to lienetit the cottoin siltesd
The party has had hoth houises
of Congress and a President for
two years.
It has therefore had a lchance to
do something to remowve the de
pression, anti relieve the cotton
producers.
1Did it do a single act, pass one
solitai'y measure designed to relieve
business depression and start the
wheel to gomng round
'Though appealed to and ieti
tioned, the liemocratic congress
i did nothing to drive the panic from
the land.
When the panic followed the de
I monetization of silver in I173,
Congress, then largely republican,
passed the Bland Allison act, in
creasi,'d the circulation and partial
ly restored good times.
If the last Democratic Congress
had acted with the same wisdom,
I the country would now be far on
the road to returning prosperity.
Instead of coming prosperity,
we have hank and husiness failures
all over the country, and declining
prices and increasing ranks of un
emp~loyed.
Why, then, should the cotton
producers of the South cling to
the Democratic party Do they
court poverty for themselves and
beggary for their children
Do they favor the creation of a
gold debt that will keep the next
ten generations in bondage to the
money power ? If they prefer this
condition to one of prosperity, then
the cotton growers should keep on
voting the Democratic ticket.
