KLAN GROWS IN MINGO
COUNTY, W. VIRGINIA
Lanky Mountaineer of Irhabod
Crane Type is Organizer
in Williamson
WILLIAMSON, W. VA., Feb. 25.
Out of the fog of oblivion with a
meagre membership of 35 into a haze
of glory in a class with mighty
movements, where organizations
whose memberships are measured by
the thousands, is the record made by
Williamson Klan, Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan during the past eight
months.
A year ago a handful of straggling
Klansmen were trjing to hold a Klan
together at Williamson. Today thou
sands of local Klansmen are looking
for a hall large enough in which to
hold Klan meetings.
Not unlike the widely advertised
cereal “There’s a Reason.” The “Rea
son” is a tall lanky mountaineer of
the Ichabod Crane type who earns
his livelihood by preaching the gos
pel to the folks who inhabit the hills
in Mingo county. This God fearing
man heard of the great organization
and, after investigation, became a
member. He was so impressed with
the work that he spread its teachings
throughout the county. As a result
Mingo county is now one of the fast
est growing Klan counties in the
state.
At Burch, a little town back in
the hills, this able man has estab
lished a Klan and is now taking in
members at the rate of more than
150 a week. Folks for miles around
are going into Burch to hear the
much trusted man tell about the Ku
Klux Klan. The town has less than
2,000 population but a Klan of sev
eral hundred men has already been
established.
Is This Personal
Klansman Creed?
By HY DOUGLASS
(The following is a copy of a pa
per found among the belongings of
one Thomas Van Alstyne, an electri
cal engineer, who died at Hanley,
Canada, in October, 1913. “Bank
Notes,” a publication for bankers,
gives this copy, as a sublime state
ment of a man's personal creed. It
seems to be fitted as a statement for
each Klansman to make and live.)
* * *
To respect my country, my profes
sion, and myself. To be honest and
fair with my fellowmen, as I ex
pect them to be honesfei and square
with me.
To be a loyal citizen of the United
States of America. To speak with
praise, and act always as a trust
worthy custodian of its good name.
To be a man whose name carries
weight wherever it goes.
To base my expectations of re
ward on a solid foundation of service
rendered.
To be willing to pay the price of
success in honest effort.
To look upon my work as an op
portunity to be seized with joy and
made the most of, and not as a pain
ful drudgery to be reluctantly en
dured.
T© remember that success lies
within myself —my own brain, my
own ambition, my own courage and
determination.
To expect difficulties and force my
way through them.
To turn hard experience into capi
tal for future use.
To carry an air of optimism in the
presence of those I meet.
To dispel ill-temper with cheer
fulness, kill doubts with strong con
viction, and reduce active friction
with an agreeable personality.
To make a study of my business.
To know my profession in every
detail.
To mix brains with my efforts, and
use system and method in my work.
To hoard days as a miser hoards
dollars.
To make every hour bring me di
vidends, increased knowledge, or
healthful recreation.
To keep my future unmortgaged
by debts.
To save as well as earn.
To cut out expensive amusements
until I can afford them.
To steer clear of dissipation, and
guard my health of body and peace
of mind as precious stock in trade.
Finally: To take a good grip on
the joys of life.
To fight against nothing so hard as
my own weakness and endeavor to
grow in strength, a gentleman, a
Chrutian.
So I may be courteous to men,
faithful to friends, true to God, —a
fragrance in the path I tread.

Let Klansmen live such a creed
and soon the spirit of our movement
will be the spirit of a re-awakened
America.
Let us remember that ours is a
plain every-day selling proposition.
Three rules of selling apply to us as
well as to prunes and pickles. Rule
one:—Possess the goods. Rule two:—
Advertise them. Or in other words
create an appetite for them. Rule
three:—Deliver the goods as adver
tised.
Surely wo can easily follow these
three rules ,as is evidenced by our
activities as a movement in the last
12 months. The urge today is for
each one individually to accept this
truth and get out on the selling end
of our work and deliver.
Let's Gw!
The effect of liberal education <s
making itself felt as far as Cali
fornia. At Leland Stanford courses
are to be given in “cheering.” A
good yell leader will receive credit
for his vocal athletic*. We wonder,
though, how much credit is given
the students who memorize a Bible
verse each day and read the consti
tution once every year or »o?

Fifty Years of Ups and Downs
of lowa Newspaper Life Told
By J. F. Grawe of Waverly
February has Lincoln day, a Wash
ington day, a Valentine day and a
groundhog day. For a short month
it has great anniversary days for our
country. But there is room for one
which has been overlooked for half
a century.
Ours is not much of an anniver
sary day when compared with the
others but it has concerned this
writer mightily. Fifty years ago we
commenced newspapering, and said
“Good Morning Good Friends,” to a
few hundred readers, in the Cedar
Valley, mostly in Chickasaw county,
having bought the Nashua Post that
week, and our first number was dated
Feb. 14, 1874.
We had learned before then that
we were good for nothing else, so
we reasoned that maybe we might
be good at newspapering.
Began Without Experience.
We commenced newspapering with
out business experience of any kind.
We knew nothing about the me
chanical department of a newspaper
office, and when we undertook to
write we were in the same fix, or
more so. We were woefully green
and clumsy at whatever we under
took to do. We came into newspap
ering about the same time that the
grasshoppers and the chinch bugs
cam# into the lowa wheat fields.
Hope we will not be remembered the
way those hopper and bug years are
remembered by some of the old set
tlers.
We owned and made the Nashua
Post, such as it was, for nearly 17
years. During those years we were
once arrested, charged with criminal
libel. Another time we were sued
for damages by a fellow who thought
we owed him $5,000 because, he said,
we had lied about him, when we
published that he turned his wife
out of doors when he was drunk. The
judge and juries before whom our
cases were tried didn’t see it the
same way as our prosecutors saw it.
And so we were not mulcted nor
jailed nor shot.
During those nopper and bug
years, we took most anything on
subscription, such as squashes, prai
rie chickens, sled length wood, old
rails and soft soap.
To Waverly in 1896.
In 1890 we bought the Bremer
County Independent. We came
down several times to look the
ground over before we bought, pne
day we walked down town from the
Illinois Central station with a man
who was then in business on the
west side. We told him that we
thought of buying The Independent,
and asked him what he thought of
it. He told us frankly, without hesi
tating, that there was no field nor
excuse nor room for us in Waverly
with the Independent, because that
paper was a dead corpse already and
that it ought to have been decently
interred long ago. Evidently the re
cord and reputation we had made in
Chickasaw county had reached Wav
erly ahead of us.
And so, we proceeded to make
room for The Independent in Wav
erly, as well as for our interesting
family.
During our first five years with
The Independent we got cold feet
many times. There were too many
newspapers here. But all the time
we thought The Independent was not
the “too many.” We gained a little
all the time, but during the first 10
years here the gain was so small it
could hardly be seen with the naked
eye. Those 10 years were as great
an affliction, for this writer, as the
hoppers arid bugs of the early 70’s.
Many Ups and Downs.
During these 50 years we have
tussled with all kinds of problems,
great and small. We have encoun
tered some awfully treacherous and
soggy roads, sometimes afoot and
alone, sometimes with the ox team
and the lumber wagon. And lately
we have been dumped by that some
times-balky modern contraption, the
gas chariot. Getting stuck in the
mud is a luxury compared with a
dump from one of those chariots
when two of them going in opposite
directions at a *pecd of 40 miles an
hour meet on the same track.
And yet, with it all, newspapering
is a great game. We don’t know
where or how we could have found
more fun and hard work. Newspap
ering and the public school are the
two greatest games in this country.
And Old Glory shall wave a thou
sand years.
CeaaoUdatlon In 19|'>.
In January, 1916, we bought the
Waverly Republican of Will Tyrell
and paid him his price. (Aside from
that the transaction was an uncondi
a certain time. The name of the
man and the name of the girl was
published.
While investigations have disclos
ed that the mystery paper publishes
nothing but facts, officers are mak
ing an attempt to find the person or
persons who are putting tne paper
out. The Ku Klux Klan has offered
its support to the officers it is un

It was thought for a while that
the Klan was instrumental in issu
ing the paper. It has been pointed
out, however, that all Klan publi
cations are printed over and above
board and without fear nor favor.
All official Ku Klux Klan publica
tions are supervised by the Bureau
of Education and Publication,
Washington, D. C.
While officers are seeking in vain
to find the publishers of The Moon

much toward ridding the commun

said.
tional surrender on the part of both
Generals Tyrell and Grawe.) Hie two
papers were made one under the
name Independent-Republican. The
first number after this transaction
was dated Jan. 28, 1915.
Judging by the treatment we have
received at the hands of the good
people of Bremer countv, and the
rest of our subscribers, that consoli
dation on the part of the proprietors
of the two papers was one of the
most sensible things they did since
the war of the rebellion was won for
the union.
Nearly all of the men and women
with whom we commenced to march
under the banner of lowa country
journalism have long since become
footsore and weary, their cares have
flown away, they have fallen out, and
they are now resting in the shade of
the green foliage of the trees on
the banks on the other side of the
river.
PRISONERS’ ESCAPE
STOPPED BY SHERIFF
Men in Oklahoma County Jail
Were Proteges of Late
GoTernor
OKLAHOMA CITY, Feb. 25.—An
attempt to liberate four alleged
murderers from the Oklahoma coun
ty jail was frustrated by Sheriff Tom
Cavnar last Monday night. These four
prisoners were the prime movers in
the assasination of Paul McCarthy
on November 19, 1922. Two of the
principals were pardonees of former
Governor Walton, and Sheriff Cavner
is the man who gave four of Wal
ton’s gunmen two minutes to get out
of his office on the morning of Octo
ber 2, when they had been order
ed by the later impeached governor
to prevent the election called for the
purpose of allowing the legislature
to meet at its own call, when any
governor should be found derelict in
his duties. The gunmen had one and
a half minutes to spare in leaving
the sheriff’s office.
Two of the principals in the assas
ination of McCarthy have pleaded
guilty and a third has been given a
life sentence, the latter prisoner
being convicted and sentenced to 40
years in the pentitentiary for bank
robbery. Two prisoners pleading
guilty were given life terms in the
penitentiary, and the fourth will go
to trial on February 25 when the
county attorney will ask the death
penalty, the allegation being made
that this fourth man is the brains of
an underworld gang in Oklahoma
county.
An anti-Klan plot is seen in an at
tempt to remove from the office of
a surveyor, the Rev. William Brown,
at Williamsburg. O. Brown was elect
ed by a majority of more than 2,000
votes. He holds a degree as a sur
veyor, but the county commissioners
have preferred charges of incompe
tency against him. He asserts he is
suspected of being a member of the
Ku Klux Klan.

KLAN SERVICE HELD AT GRANT PARK
CHURCH OF CHRIST IN DES MOINES
“The Ideal Citizen," was the topic
of the sermon delivered by Rev. J. E.
Reeser, pastor of the Grant Park
Church of Christ, at East Twenty
fifth street and Capitol avenue, Des
Moines, on Sunday evening, February
17.
At the close of the service an offi
cial of the Des Moines Ku Klux Klan,
wearing the robes of his office, but
with his hood off, addressed the con
gregation, following the presentation
of a silk American flag.
The keynote of the Klansman’s ad
dress was: “We must Americanize
foreigners, or the foreigners will for
eignize America.’’
In his sermon, Rev. Mr. Reeser held
up George Washington as the ideal
of American citizenship. He outlined
the hardships through which the
United States had passed during the
time of its founding as an inde
pendent republic.

MASONS URGED TO AID
UNIVERSAL EDUCATION
Educated Child Will Not Be
Bad Citizen, Says Inspector
General
(Scottish Rite News Service)
WICHITA, KANS., Feb. 25.—1 n an
address before the reunion of the
Scottish Rite bodies, Thomas G.
Fitch, 33rd degree, Inspector General
of the Scottish Rite in Kansas de
clared: “The first duty of every
Mason is to see that every boy and
girl in the United States has equal
educational advantages.
“Every Mason must take an inter
est in the schools of his community.
He must see that the best advan
tages are provided not only for the
children, but for the teachers.
“The boy or girl who is educated
is not going to be a bad citizen.
Every child in the United States is
entitled to an education, and one of
the goals of Scottish Rite Freema
sonry is to see that he gets it.
“Educational advantages todoy are
far better than they were twenty
five years ago, but we must not be
content until all these advantages
are within reach of the poorest child
in the land.”

KLAN HEARS LECTURE
MARSCOTT. W. VA., Feb. 26—The
local Methodist Episcopal church was
jammed to capacity Monday evening
last when a national lecturer for the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan deliv
ered an address on the principles of
the great American organization.
Scores of persons expressed a desire
to join the movement following the
speaking.
A resolution was adopted recently
by the board of education of Youngs
town, 0., ordering the Bible read
daily in the schools of the city. The
only dissenting vote in the board was
cast by James H. Nutt. Rabbi I. E.
Philo, of the Rodef Sholem Temple,
in a statement to The Fiery Cross,
asserted the move to have the Bible
read in the schools is undemocratic
and he vigorously opposed it.
today, the Rev. Mr. Reeser said.
“There are too many Benedict Ar
nolds, in the cloak of Protestantism,”
he declared. In this class he named
rotten politicians and poor judges
who were making the courts a mock
ery in the eyes of the people.
“Some of the fundamentals of our
national life are the separation of
church and state, the rights of fran
chise. The ballot box today should
be as sacred to the people as was
the ark of the covenant to the old
Israelites.”

! A Lesson From a Hymn
‘Blest be the tie that binds" a tie
of greater proportions than any
earthly tie, a tie bigger than any fra
ternal obligation, a tie of God and
love, “Our hearts in Christian love,”
sending out through the medium of
Klankraft that love to whosoever
shall seek, ‘The fellowship of kin
dred minds” as a unit in the great
unified work, the work of making this
world more closely approach the
standard set by the Nazarene, “la
like to that above.”
Klansmen, live the spirit of thia
hymn and you will be doing your
share in approaching the standard.
Go to church and take a friend. Send
your children to Sabbath School.
Practice the faith that you believe,
and remember through it all:
“A charge to keep have I;
A God to glorify;
A never-dying soul to save,
And fit it for the sky.”
Interest in the activities of the
Klan was quickened in Watseka, 111.,
last Friday night, when “Fighting
Bob” Evans, of the Realm lecture
corps, delievered a patriotic address
at the Christian church in that city.
