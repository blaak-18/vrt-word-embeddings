Mr. J. W. Jarowek, the well

Mrs. M. E. Simpson.
This lady has been engaged in business in
Lafayette for so many years that she is en
abled to know exactly the kind of goods
that will please the trade. Not to be be
hind this year Mrs. Simpson has placed in c
stock the very latest styles of millinery gods, L
and in ttis5 respect her establishment is re- I
plete. The young ladies here have a chance a
to obtain their headgear at very reasonable I
prices inasmuch as Mrs. Simpson being a
very close buyer is enabled to give her t
trade the benefit of her knowledge. There r
is no reason then for looking elsewhere for 1
goods, when right here in our midst we
find an establishment of this kind. So don't
be talked into buying cheap trash goods,
but take your trade to the legitimate source I
and receive a true value for your expendi
ture. Mrs. Simpson's tra!e cst:te:s over .
the entire parish and she has bteilded it up t
by careful study of the wishes of the con- s
munity. Here the ladies will find a line
opportunity to indulge their desire in hiol
(day presents, as Mrs. Simpson is carrying a I
complete line in the way of notions, and h-r "
assortment is so complete that the wishes of
the purchaser can be readily gratified,
Felix Demanade
Is on the lookout for the Christmas tra.'e
and he wants old folks anl] yooung folks to
not make a grave mistake and go elsewhere
for their presents, as he has this year taken
more than ordinary precaution to see he ha:s
in stock everything to satisfy the wishes of
the buyer, and he has scaled the prices in
such a way that It is carte blanche for your
returning to the old stan]. lie loses no
time in carrying dead goods but always keeps
up to date in maintaining his stock of goods,
both in groceries, crockery. willow ware,
fancy goods and novelties, and so far as his
prices are concerned he says if I don't give !
you a bargain I won.'s invite you hack. Of
course his prices are tempting, sometime mo:re
than half the real worth. But there's more
than that, he has goods for every test . .
Very little costs often mean a very narrow
choice and sluggish styles, an I out of season
qualities. They mean notihing of that sort
at Demanade's. lie pri lks himself on
having cverthing new and fresh. He wants
you to come and see his gools, and assur-es
you that you still go away please.,l. Ile hali
been engaged in bus:iness in this city for sev
eral years and is fameiliar wiith vour wans

hiscustomers the benefit of tihi knw.lcedg...
A Bazaar
The writers of books are possessed of one
penchant that attracts more attention than
any other-that is a description of the sh 'ipa
of Paris, and in this lin: they lay open the
most attractive spot of their article --de
scribing as they do in minute detail every
feature that pertains to a bosiness. Charl.s
Dickens. in his ,°Curiosity Shop" indicates
a traffic of this nature, dscsribing it as par
ticularly attractive ont account of its varied
characteristics. And so we thought when
visiting the store of Wnm. Clegg yesterday.
He iscarrying the verb' latest line of nc.vel
ties and is making an elegant display of the
same. On the tables is exhibiterl the offer
ing for these holidays, including any and ev
ery thing to ibe found in the novelty line.
His display in this respect we regard as the
finest in this city, being so well designel
as to attract attention. Thh high intrinsic
value of the offerings on his sale lis;t should
recommend themselves to the public, espe
cially to every economic person dealing with
him. Hlie is carrying for the trade, articles
of use; articles of merit; and articles of
necessity, and in fact anything that serves
the want of the tradses p-ople, a.l th:is at
Scheap rates. We commnend to o.r rea.lcis
an exam'r n ion of his goods, content with the
knowledge that they will be repaid,.
The Merchant Tailor.
No well regulated town is complete with
out the tailor and his goose. He is as es
sential to the community as the song book
to the church choir. And he must be a
.man of knowledge; be an architect, and
be a builder. Lafayette is fortunate in this
respect. Mr. 4'Roseastein keeps if line with
Sthe varied changR i.a fashion and Ieing a
4)raCtical ctatteriM esabled to furnish a gir
natent after the very l.atest mode. Asid

extends its symlpathy. A
Real Parisian. e
Demorest, editorially speaking, views a
place of busminess that carries ware for .the A
sex to garb itself as Parisian. Why this term
is used we know not, but we do know that
every angl-..saxon and latin speaking peo
pie adapt themselves to the Paris mode,
and the properly attired young lady is the
one whose head.gear is right up to date.
And during the holidays the young people
seem at all times desirous of rendering their
appearance in-touch with the times. A per
son may be well clotlhed and her general con
tour not open to criticism; to the casual oh
server though, if there is aflaw in the dregs it
will be observed more quickly in the head
apparel than anywhere else. It is Worth that
savs,' "I can dress, but youar milliner mast
assist me." That is true both of the lady
and gentleman. Their clothing may be
par exccllencc, but their appearance is not
the thing un:les their headt-cuvering is in
keeping.
These thoughts su:ggested themselves tg
