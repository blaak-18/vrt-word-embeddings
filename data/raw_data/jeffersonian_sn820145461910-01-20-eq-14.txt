VETERANS’ CORNER
MY MILITARY TACTICS IN FORT
DELAWARE.
One afternoon in March, 1865,
some officials and M.D.’s came
among the prisoners making out a list
of all those that they thought would
not be fit for military service soon,
sick and decrepits of all kinds, said
persons to be sent away next day on
exchange. During the night one of
those on the list died; here was an
opening, I thought, for me to make
a display of my military genius. So
I go to the dead man’s friends and
get his full name, his company, his
regiment, where captured and when,
and other things I thought necessary
for a military man to know. Next
morning when the hour arrived to
go I fell in, and stood up in line in
the dead man’s place, and when the
dead man’s name w r as reached and
called I answered.
Now it so happened that I was not
able to inform everybody of this
military move of mine, and when I
answered a host of these Confeder
ates turned their heads and looked
at me. Now this looking attracted
the attention of the officers and they
called the name again. I answered
just as promptly. They asked me
what company, what regiment,
where captured and when. All this
I answered promptly. This seemed
to have stunned the officials, and
they turned and asked some men,
who were standing in the rear, who
I was. These standing men were
traitors, w r ho had taken the oath and
kept in the barracks as detectives.
They said they did not know, but
thought I was a Texan. They called
the guard and told him to “take this
man to the Fort and put him into a
cell.” So the guard marched me out
and when we reached the gate, there
was a great crowd of Confeds who
had come to see who was going to
draw the white beans. Here I ran
around this crowd of men and got
aw r ay from the guard and went to
my barracks and reported to my
friends that my flank had been turn
ed, and without assistance a defeat
was in sight. So I changed hats and
coats with my bunk mate and went
out into the street. In about twenty
minutes here came old Adams (we
called him Hackout) with the guard,
looking for me.
They ordered everybody out of the
house and into line, then told them
that they would punish them till they
produced the man they wanted, who
had escaped from the guard a few
minutes before. Did these Texans
tell these inhuman fiends where I
was? No, sir, and they would have
been standing there to this day be
fore they would have done so. So I
went to the guard and told him that
I was the man they were looking for
and they could do just as they pleas
ed with me, on my account they
should not punish other prisoners.
So I was led away to the Fort and
put into a cell, where there was
freezing and gnashing of teeth. The
cell that I was put into was about
six by eight feet in a solid wall with
a sheet-iron door, a small window,
about eight by ten inches, through
which I got air to breathe. All was
3effersontan
solid rock around me, so if I lay
down it was upon a solid rock floor.
My dress was a suit of grey Con
federate, jacket and pants, I had no
overcoat or blanket and it was cold
weather.
Well, about midnight the sergeant
of the guard come down to my cell
and told me that, while it was
against his orders, he would take me
up to the guardhouse and let me
warm. So we went up to where
there was a redhot stove, and
I was thawing out a Samaritan ap
proached me from the rear and gave
me a quart tin cup heaping full of
baked beans, and the man did not
say one word to me, in fact I hardly
saw the man as he went away into
another room, and none of this
guard had any talk for me. So as I
thawed out I ate the beans in silence,
and these were the sweetest beans
that I have ever tasted. When I was
warm I was carried back to the rock
cell, and spent the balance of the
night. So these unmerciful wretches
kept me in that cell three of 'the
longest days and nights I have ever
seen.
Now these people, that is what
General Lee always called them, had
no right to punish me in any such
way, as I was only a prisoner of war
and was not a criminal and had a
right to escape if I could, provided I
took the chances of being shot,
which I did.
The editor will please note that I
was not a colonel and only a private,
and about the only one I know of
now. There were a few prisoners
that had friends in the north of the
Federal lines, who sent them money
and clothing. These did not suffer
so muclf, but where there was one of
these there were a thousand that had
no such friends, and it was absolute
ly impossible for a person of any
kind to live on the allowance given
these prisoners from the Southland,
it was so little that it just remained
in their bodies and rotted them, not
being enough for nature to perform
her function of passing through.
They called it scurvy, while it was
only rot from which they died by the
score, and this was their object: to
kill just as many as possible.
On June the 9th, 1865, myself, with
others, took the oath of allegiance
to Uncle Sam, agreeing to be good
citizens forever. So we boarded a
steamer and were carried up the wide
old Delaware River to the great
Smoky City, Philadelphia, anti turn
ed loose in the old town. Uncle Sam
gave us transportation back to Texas.
I had transportation for three Dutch
men and one Irishman on my list,

and have that list yet. The Germans
lived in Austin and Washington
counties. The Irishman stopped
with the first bunch of Irish section
hands he struck on the railroad in
Pennsylvania, and left us. His name
was John Woodhouse; we called him
“Woody the Sailor.” The most im
portant man to me in this little
crowd was Dave Arnett, a six-footer,
from Roberson county, Texas, we
called him Buck Arnett, and I did not
know his true name for many years
afterwards. Buck Arnett has long
since crossed over the divide. The
Germans I have never heard from to
this day, since we separated at Hous
ton, Texas. Now it so happened that
I, after having a hard case of pneu
monia in Fort Delaware, went blind,
or what we called “moon-eyed”; that
is, I could not see a wink in the
world after daylight was gone; no
artificial light would give me any
light at all. So I had to be led by
some one wherever I might go after
the sunlight was gone, and this no
ble-hearted Dave Arnett was the
Samaritan that was always at my
side to take me by the hand and
lead me wherever I might go, and
without being asked to do so. Our
route was by rail to Cairo, 111.,
thence down the great river aboard
the John Killgore, an old-fashioned
steamboat, to the Crescent City, New
Orleans. Here we remained but a
few hours till we were aboard a
steamship for Galveston, across the
briny pond. When we walked off of
the boat at Galveston Buck Arnett
got down on his knees and thanked
the good Lord that he was once more
on Texas soil. Here we were met by
some friends who directed us to a
