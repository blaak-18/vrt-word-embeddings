BLARSTED HINGLISH,
SOME OF THEIR MANY STEALS
RECOUNTED.
Ammog Them the Pactle Railway, Loag
Time Beads, the Lefga Tender Power of
SIver ia 18n3. Our allUway Securities,
Gold Maes sad Breweries.
I have been laboring under the im
pression that I had been a pretty close
observer of what has been transpiring
in these United States for thirty years.
And now, in view of the fact that
(;rover Cleveland has seen fit to call
the people's attention to a possible
theft that is about to be perpetrated
by the English on this side of the wa
ter it has dawned upon my mind that
it would not be amiss for me to enu
merate a few of the thefts that have
been already committed by these
"blarsted Hinglish." I saw them come
over here at the close of the war
and steal a first mortgage on the Pa
cific railway and leave the United
States to "hold the sack" to the ex
tent of $64,000,000 of bonds and inter
est on the same to the tune of nearly
$50,000,000 more. I saw them come
over here about the close of the war
and gather up our legal tender cur
rency and with it steal some $2,000,
000,000 out of our treasury, which,
with interest on the same, amounts,
up to date, to about $2,000,000,000
more. I saw them come over here
in 1874 and steal several millions of
long-time bonds. I saw them come
over here again in 1873 and
steal the legal tender power away from
all the silver we had in our mines. I
have seen them come over here and
steal all of our most valuable railway
securities and hold them in so fast a
grip that their financial agent, J. Pier
pont Morgan, says that he has it in his
power to demand the resignation of
the president of any of our trunk lines
who objects to a rate of freight that
will not meet the interest and divi
dends upon these securities, no matter
what the condition of business is.in
this country.
I have seem them pteal the stocks
ad securities of our gold and silver
mines In the sme maner as those of
the railways. I saw them two years
ago steal all of our breweries (but un
fortunately left them in the country).
Saw them only last summer steal a ma
jority of the stock of the Anaconda,
the largest copper mine in the country.
I have mea them come over here with
their mortgage and lo companies and
steal a lien a 60 per coat of all
the agrinitral land of this coun
try. I hw seen them steal
0,W0010 from the treasury
during the p-t two years. I saw them
last smmer come over here and enter
the eemutive measio at the dead
hour of midnight and steal S2,000,
000 of r beds. And atthe time
that I a penaing thisarticle the Aso
clated Ps dispthes bdarm me
that the ma English agest is at the
wt'h i hees prperiag to steal another
atch. And the same agent is at this
momset tb with a legal jimmy to
stel the 000,000 of geeabacks
that we have let. "Don't it beat all?"

"The e is an eternal fitness in
things," and the people are getting
tired of being robbed by law. The
light is breaking, the change is com
ing.
If you are too ignorant to know your
rights and too cowardly to be a man.
you are the kind of a "rooster" that
the monopolists delight in just before
election.
Business men continue to fail not
withstanding the abundant supply of
•"confidence" of the Cleveland-Sher
man brand. Confidence don't pay
debts, however.
It is pitiable for an administration
to begin explaining to the people a
year in advance of an election. Guess
Gov. Culberson has had his ear to the
ground, and is scared.
A little bench legged, bobtailed,
weak eyed lice, if he is not too lazy to
bark when a stranger approaches, is
entitled to more respect than a man
who sells his vote to monopoly.
The practice of paying officials, statc
or federal, their salaries for the time
they spend hunting, "curing snake
bites" and visiting, must stop. It is
wrong. It is something for nothing.
The Culberson taxeaters at Austin
are making a desperate effort to prove
to the people that the deficiency has
not increased since Hogg went out
from $1,800,000 to $1,800,000, or just
half a million.
Some men haven't got as much cour
age as a little sugar ant, for it will
sting until it dies in defense of its
rights, while they drag around and
say: "I recken Ill have to vote the

The lowing of the cream colored

"Let her go Megarden," it has outlived
its usefulness and principles.
The Democratic doctors disagree as
to what ails Barney Gibbs. just as they
do on all other questions. Barney
seems to be afflicted with an aggrava

has never been known to prove fatal,
but it generally improves the patient.
Frogs sit in the bog and croak be

the old party leaders know it is wrong

The frog knows when to quit croaking,

sense enough to quit their meanness,
and the Populists will turn them out.
At Calaveras, Wilson county, the
Mexicans have built a cock pit and
spend Sundays fighting chickens.
Gov. Culberson should call the legisla
ture together to pass a law to prohibit
chickens from fighting, or mass the
melitia and send them down there, and
go himself and "stop it if it takes every
man In the state!" It is dagainst the

I MONROE DOCTRINE.
ITS POLITICAL AND COMMER
CIAL SIGNIFICANCE.
The Buolding of the Nicaragua Canal
Will Give to Trans-Miulsslppi Ulnt
Ports the Business of Exportiag the
Produ(t of the West.
Globe-Democrat. St. Louis, Mo.
The reception of the President's mes
sage demonstrated that the American
people are a unit on the Monroe doc
trine. Between nations no doctrine, no
principle, no action can be upheld ex
cept by force. Twenty centuries or
civilization have failed to establish the
golden rule as the basic principle of
the acts of nations. Thirty days ago
English writers characterized it as the
"nebulous Monroe Doctrine." To-day
that principle has an entity, an in
dividuality in the unwritten laws be
tween governments.
A writer in the December number of
the North American Review says: "We
all know that the development and ex
panslon of nationalities follow the
lines of least resistence and are gov
erned by inflexible natural laws. Equal
ly well known are the principles which
govern the redistribution of trade cen
ters resulting from the opening up of
new channnels of commerce." The same
writer says when the Nicaragua Canal
is opened Europe will be brought to the
very doors of America.
The Monroe Doctrine assures the
Nicaragua Canal. The Nicaragua Canal
will build up Trans-Mississippi Gulf
ports. The total value of the exports
of the United States of the United
States is $793,392,955. The Trans-Mis
sassippi furnishes of that amount $448,
643,727. This business will be done by
Gulf ports.
Great Britain is still suffering from
the deflection of commerce from the
Cape Route to the Sues Canal. Com
merce follows the line of least expense.
These incontrovertible arguments no
doubt decided the great banking house
of Alexander Brown & Sons to under.
take the work of developing the natural
harbor of Aransas Pass, Texas. Al
ready they have so nearly completed
the work that a festival of rejoicing on
the occasion of the Homeseekers' Ex
cursion, February 11th is being pre
pared. The railroad fare for the round
trip from any point in the west is only
$2.00 more than the fare one way. A
steamship ride through the harbor out
into the Gulf, a Green Turtle and Can
vass Back Duck Barbecue will be given
to the excursionists. Everybody is In
vited to be present and look over the
new town of Aransas Pass (whose
motto is "Here Everybody Shall Make
Money") and the rich and cheap lands
sarrounding that port.
Wanted His Hair Restored liwardly.
A Boston barber, who seldom talks.
has been telling a story. He rays that
some time ago an anxious old farmer
came in and asked for three bottles of
hair restorer. liHe was gone for about
a month, but at the end of that time
he returned and said: ."See here, that
restorer of yours has done me no good."
"No good! That's funny. Did you
use the three bottles?" *"Yes, I did:
and my head is worse, if anything."
'-Well," said the barber, "that's funny,
for it never before failed." "Well, see
here." said the farmer, "I'll drink an
other bottle of that restorer, and if
doesn't cure me. it's the last time any
such nonsense will catch me."
Good Ides.
Paris has all its streets and public
buildings lighted at the cost of gas
production, and in ten years it has re
ceived $40,000,000 from the company
furnishing gas. The city prevents the
watering of stocks and compels a divis
ion with the city of all profits over a
certain amount.
Feblie TLIeves.
A writer who has been giving atten
ition to the subject shows that in 1893
the known defalcations by trusted fl
nancial agents amounted to *19,000,
000. In 1894 they had risen to $26,
000,000, and the outlook for 1895
shows a still further increase.

There is nothing particularly rotten
in Denmark just now, as was the camse
