OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
There were so many letters on the
subject of “What I hope to be” that
they have run beyond the allotted
time. The two first prizes go to Ala
bama; the second prizes are di
vided between Georgia and Florida.
These four letters were well writ
ten; the aim was high, and we be
lieve the letters really expressed the
true hopes of the writers. We invite
each of the prize-winners to write to
us often, never resting content with
just one prize; and we sincerely
trust that one day their hopes will
find a worthy fulfilment.
Boys: Ist prize—Harper Cole, Jr.,
12 years old, Roanoke, Ala.
2d prize—John M. Willis, 12
years old, Quincy, Fla.
Girls: Ist prize—Fidettie Calla-
way, 13 years old, Ashland,
Ala.
2d prize—Cora Funderburg,
12 years old, Suwanee, Ga.
A FLORIDA BOY.
I hope to be an honest, upright,
truthful, intelligent man, who does
not use whiskey or tobacco in any
form, and who will tell the truth
anywhere he is; and I hope to be
a writer on a paper as good as the
Jeffersonian.—Robert Woodall, 13
years old, Kissimmee, Fla.
WANTS TO BE A MUSICIAN.
I want to be a musician, so that I
may be able to entertain myself and
other people, too, by playing sweet
music. What good would this old
world be without any music? Even
the birds, with their sweet voices,
make us happy by their songs.—
Juanita Sikes, 11 years old, Glenn
ville, Ga.
TO SAY AND DO RIGHT THINGS.
I would like to be strong enough
to say a thing and stick to it, and
strong enough to do the right thing;
to be a blessing to my country, and
not a curse to it. I would like to be
faithful to duty, and truthful at all
times. I would like to help the weak
and helpless, and be glad at all
times to do some one a service.—
John M. Willis, 12 years old, Quincy,
Fla.
TO BE FIRM AND WISE.
I would rather be a great general
and not be afraid to face the enemy.
1 would like to stand firm for the
rights of my country and be wise
enough to know what the rights of
my people are, like Mr. Watson. But
I will have to study hard, and I in
tend to make good use of all my
school days.—Beman Davis, 14 years
old, Forney, Ala.
AN OKLAHOMA BOY.
I am going to be a merchant when
I grow old enough to work for my
self. I want to have a large store
and plenty of goods to sell. I think
it is much more pleasant work than
farming. I am farming now, and I
do not find it very pleasant work.
When I go to work for myself I will
try to save up my money and have a
Jeffersonian
store of my own.—Bryan Metcalf,
12 years old, Bokchito, Okla.
FROM MISSISSIPPI.
I don’t care much about diamonds,
wealth, fine clothes, to be idle all the
time, or anything like that. I don’t
want to be an actress or a singer,
and dress in tights and sing and
dance on the stage; but I mean to
xearn to paint, and what I want most
is to be merry, jolly and lovable, so
that everyone will thinks lots of me
and will welcome me everywhere I
go.—Beatrice Lackey, 15 years old,
Bodga, Miss.
TO BE A TRUE FARMER.
I hope to be a farmer, for farming
is the noblest occupation there is.
Farmers till the soil and produce
things necessary to life and civiliza
tion. As a farmer I want to be true,
honest, independent, loyal to every
body and with a good education and
plenty of common sense. I also
want to be the most industrious and
progressive farmer, one that will
build up the country.—Paul Funder
burg, Suwanee, Ga.
SOME MORE ABOUT BOYS.
Papa takes both the weekly and
the monthly Jeffersonian and I like
to read the children’s pages. I thank
Mr. Watson for free delivery and
bringing the mail to our doors. I
think girls are as useful as boys. I
can milk and like to do it very well,
but I had rather be a dressmaker
and a good cook than anything else.
—Carry Willis, Dallas, Ga.
WOULD BE A REFORMER.
My desire is for a good education,
whereby I could be a public man, so
that I could proclaim to the great
masses of the people the evils of our
government; for since I have read
your papers it is plain to me that
the common man is not treated fair
in our government.—Charley Cald
well, 14 years old, Tilton, Ga.
THE OCHLOCKNEE BOY.
Here I come again. I will write a
funny story. An old farmer was told
that a new railroad was going to
run right through his barn. He ex
claimed: “Now, by gum, I guess I
will have something to say about
that. I got something else to do be
side opening and shutting them barn
doors every time a train comes
along.”—Albert Heald, 9 years old,
Ochlocknee, Ga.
FROM A TEXAS GIRL.
Here comes another Texas girl to
join your club. I think boys are all
right. Some of them are very use
ful. They carry in stove wood for
their mothers and help with the
cows. I think if it was not for boys
the world would not go on at all.
There are but very few lazy boys,
but the lazy ones sure are lazy. They
will tell their mothers that they
don’t want to do so and so. I don’t
like lazy boys, I like smart boys. I
have three brothers and they are all
smart boys.—Virgie Whatley, Ash
land, Texas.
