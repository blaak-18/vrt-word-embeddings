Text:-Thy will be done on earth as
I; is in heaven.
The first word that Jesus uttered
- when he began his public ministry is
positive proof of the evil of the then
existing social and moral conditions,
and of the necessity of r orup. He says
to his hearers "Repent!" "Turn your
back upon the existing order that has
brought you to the very verge
of political, social and moral ruin.
rad acept the noew order, for the king
dea of heaven is at hand." We do not
need to go to the musty records of pro
Pane history to learn that the social and
moral conditions of the people at that
day wee at war with the social and
moral welfare of society and had Is
curred the displeasure of God. The
words of the greatest of all reformers
will oonvinee you of that.
Neither do we need to search the
-musty records of the pasut to understand
the nature of the reformation intro
duced by Jesus and carried orward by
hls apostles. Now he has told us in
language not to be misunderstood
"The kingdom of heaven is at hand."
A new sociology, of dlvine origin aad
birth, was to take the place of the old
order-a sociology whereln the will of
the father might be done in earth as
In heaven.
But, the objector to our view of the
m slag of Chrlit in his announcement
of the near approach of the coming
kiagdom will say: "Ah, this was
wholly a spiritual kingdom ad would
be set up in the hearts and would
affect only the spiritual and religious
ife of the nation, and would have noth
ing whatever to do with the political
and social life of the people.
I aasr: Certainly the kingdom of
heaves set up in the earth, would.
doubtess, greatly affect the religious or
piritsl life of the people, bt can a

trial and moral oendltions expressed in
Jesus' words, "The kingdom of heaven
is at hand." It is praying for the abo
lition of those self-seeking conditions
that have bred our present competitive
strife, strife that has brought us as a
nation to the verge of political, social
and moral ruin, and for the establish
a ment of that divine civilization based
on God's one and only law of love.
Are the conditions under which we
continue to exist ap a nation in accord
with this great Taw r" (God. Are we,
socially, morally or politically, actusted
in our conduct toward each other by the
law of love? If so. we do not need to
pray this prayer. But It is not so. Take
up any department of our national or
social life, and the spirit of competitive
individualism will. be found to be the
inspiration of our national or social ac
tions. In one form or another the same
selfish, competitive, industrial system
under which we at present live, has
existed since the history of men began.
We have never had any other system,
and whatever of industrial wrong
exists, and whatever is socially wrong
must be charged to that same industrial
system which it was the missen of
Jesus to overthrow. Since there is but
one kind of right, and lacking the prin
cipal of moral right, or, in other words,
living in disobedience to the one great
law, our moral sense must pronounce
I against the civilisation of the past and
present the verdict-wholly wrong. It
is a part of the same system that des
troyedL the national life of the Jews;
that overthrew the Roman government;
that brought forth the terrors of the
Prench revolution; that twice drenched
eaour own land in blood, and that fur
nished the incentive for the cruciflxion
of the Son of God.
I have no sympathy with that class
of premhuers who counsel submission to
the evils from which we to-day are suf
fering, with our only hope of reward in
the lt eternal. Jesus exhorted his
disciples to say, "The kingdom of
heaven is at hand"-not a far away
thlng, to the view of which distance
lends enehantment, but close by, near at
hand. And ha tells them, "When you
inray, sy, 'Our Father, thy will be done
in earth'-not elsewhere--'as it is done
In heave.'"
It Is evident to e that the oely thing
that saads In the wiy of the comlag in
of that time is our own wills. He said
to the Jew, Repent. He says to us, tes
peat; the kingdom to heaves is a haad.
But why must eve psees 4netrls
and social system be _boliced be
we ear ekpect the sil of' eod to be
dee in earth as t heaves. .
For the reason that there I but one
kind of right Before men will obey
the law-the will of God-they must re
peat, mast tara away froee that which
i wholldy snsh and wMch arrays
brother agast brother. As indlild
ash ad as a nateon we are socially and
iadustrally wrang and therefore mar
ally wrong. We stand as the venge of
ruin. Being socially and industrially
wrong .sapaot be mormlly right; sad
being aihralfy wrenr we are in no eon
