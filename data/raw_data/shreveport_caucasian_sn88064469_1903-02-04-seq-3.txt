TROUBLE IS FEARED.
One h Supported by I lie sojii ;erva

at Acute Stage.
New Orleans, Feb: 4.-Passengers
arriving on the United Fruit com
pany's steamer Breakwater, direct
Puerto Cortez, report Americans flee
ing from Spanish Honduras in expec
tation of a revolution, which has been
brewing in that republic for the past
two months on account of the refusal
of President Sierra. the present in
cumbent, to surrender the presidental
seat to Senor Bonilla, who, reports say,
has been officially elected the succes
sor of Sierra.
President-elect Donilla expected to
be inaugurated last Sunday, but the
Breakwater left Puerto Cortez too soon
to see the expected declaration of hos
tilities.
President Sierra has been Honduras'
chief executive for the past few years,
but last fall an election for president
was held. Several days were required
to get up the count, which showed
Senor Bonilla received 45,000 votes, ac
cording to his version. Pi esident Sier
ra and Dr. Soto contested the election
and asserted fraud had bisn used in
the supposed election of Senor Bonilla.
Allegation were made there were but
50,9000 voters in the entire republic
and it was impossible for any candi
date to -'poll the total Senor Bonilla
claimed.
Sierra contends he is president,
while Bonilla says he is the official
heed of the republic.
Sierra represents the C*onservatives
and Bonilla the Liberals. Both have a
big following and propose declaring
war if one or the other is not sc'ated.
The Conservatives are making seorel
preparations for fight. Bonilia also has
been active and fully prepared to put
up a hard struggle against troops un
der President Sierra.
