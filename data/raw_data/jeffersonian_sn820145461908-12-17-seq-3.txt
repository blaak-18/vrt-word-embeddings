Paper Not Prom Wood Pulp
Cotton Stalks and Corn Stalks May Soon figure as Important factors in the Paper Indus
try, to the nene fie of Both the Forests and the 'Farmers.
By B. S. Tigner.
From the spruce forests of Maine
to the cotton fields of Mississippi is
a far cry—and, at first glance, there
appears little, if any, possible con
nection between the industrial prob
lems that beset the people of these
two widely separated States —yet, the
connection is there, and—
But let’s look closer. Urged by a
steadily growing demand for paper,
the forests of the one State are dis
appearing at a rate to cause the most
serious apprehension. So serious, in
fact, that a tardy government is now
taking measures to preserve at least
a remnant of what seemed at first to
be an inexhaustible supply of timber.
It is estimated that there is barely a
sufficient supply of spruce pine to
last for three years more at the pres
ent rate of consumption, and, when
you consider that it requires twenty
eight acres of this wood to furnish
the pulp to make paper for one edi
tion of a large metropolitan newspa
per, you may possible get some idea
of the acreage that must be cut over
every year to secure pulp wood for
the stock on which we print our in
numerable papers, magazines, and
books, aside from the enormous quan
tities used in other ways.
Only the other day one of the best
informed writers of our time pre
dicted that, unless something was
done to provide a substitute for wood
pulp, we would, within a few years,
be paying ten cents for a newspaper
and fifty cents for a magazine. The
owner of a popular magazine printed
two pages in a recent issue, on black
paper, with white ink, with the ac
companying prophecy that this would
be the style in which we might ex
pect to receive the newspaper of the
future, unless something was dis
covered to take the place of wood in
the manufacture of paper.
Canada, profiting by the example
of her reckless neighbor, and fore
seeing the same devastation of her
own forests, is endeavoring to safe
guard her own interests by prohibit
ing the export of wood for pulp.
To add to this, forest fires, extend
ing from Maine to Michigan, have
been far more destructive than ever
before —the loss from this source
alone amounting to millions upon
millions of cords.
This, then, is the problem of the
one section —to supply pulp wood,
despite these handicaps, with which
to meet the insistent demands for
paper. Paper we must and will have.
Its use marks the progress of a na
tion’s civilization.
Now, look at Mississippi—an ugly
little bug, with a case-hardened cov
ering and a boring-machine head, has
marched triumphantly and all too
rapidly across Texas, through Louis
iana and found a lodging within her
borders —and this, too, regardless of
the combined efforts of the govern
ment scientists and all the planters
in its line of march to stop its prog
ress. This bug is the boll weevil.
For years this fight has continued,
with the bug always the victor, the
experts arid the farmers gradually
giving ground. As a last resort, the
experts have said that the only pos
sible way to destroy this bug is to
gather the cotton stalks as soon as
the greater portion of the crop has
been picked and burn them, not wait
ing to secure the late top crop, which
is very desirable on account of the
excellence of the fiber. Unless the
bug is destroyed, or, at least confined
to the districts at present affected,
complete ruin faces the cotton plant
er.
There you have the problem of the
other section —the extermination of
the boll weevil. Both of these are so
world-wide in their effects that they
must necessarily touch at some point,
yet, even in this day, when the occur
rence of the merely unexpected has
become commonplace, if you are told
that with the solution of the one
problem the other will disappear, that
this can be done not only without
cost, but that its full accomplishment
will add more than fifty millions of
dollars annually to the wealth of this
country, you will hardly grasp it fully
at first, and the chances are that,
when you do, the overworked adjec
tive “wonderful” will be called forth
for further duty. Now up comes a
man, W. H. Croll, with a process for
manufacturing paper from cotton
stalks.
The United States uses annually
about four million tons of paper of
all kinds, and when it is known that
, there are enough cotton stalks grown
every year in the South to make
eight million tons, the result is ob
vious. Furthermore, grinding the
stalks, leave, roots, and unopened
bolls of cotton into pulp will effec
tually destroy the boll weevil. Be
yond this, the use of this waste is an
additional source of revenue to the
cotton grower. The average produc
tion is one ton of stalks for each bale
of cotton, and the farmer can get
from three to five dollars per ton to
gather and deliver these stalks, which
would mean thirty-six to sixty mil
lion of dollars added each year to the
cotton growers of the country.
Mr. Croll, the inventor of this new
process of making paper, had, up to
1902, long been engaged in the manu
facture of paper, and, when he first
saw a cotton plant, he was impressed
with the possibility of its containing
suitable fiber for paper, and com
menced the experiments which have
just been made a commercial possi
bility. The paper has been made and
it is only a question of a short while
when, it is claimed by the new manu
facturers, it will be on the market.
“What particularly attracted my
attention,” said the inventor, “to the
cotton stalk was its similarity to flax.
I knew that the fiber must be there,
because experts had been engaged for
years trying to solve the practical
features in the use of these stalks
for paper making. The problem has
always been how to treat the stalks
so as to preserve the fiber and retain
the strength in the paper, without too
much waste of stock in the process.
There has never been any question as
Gfye 3effcrsoftlan
to the desirability from every stand
point of paper made from these
stalks. In fact, expert chemists and
men familiar w’ith the requirements
of paper stock have long been agreed
that the very best cellulose for mak
ing a durable book paper would come
from the fiber of the cotton plant.
You see, this fiber is a thin walled
tube which collapses in a peculiar,
twisted manner in the beating proc
ess, interlaces in the felting process
much better than other fibers, and
holds its grasp tenaciously. It is both
strong and flexible.
“On this trip I collected quite a
bundle of the stalks. I tried on these
every known process used in the
preparation of other paper stock, but
without success. In order to be prac
ticable, I knew that some way must
be found by which the entire plant
could be utilized. There are ten dis
tinct parts of this plant, that is: the
stalk, root, branches, leaves, boll, cot
ton not matured in the boll, seed, oil
in the seed, bark, and pith in stalk. I
knew also that the process must be
such as to prevent excessive waste in
the stock.
“It seems a long time that I have
been working on this, even w’hen you
only count the years, and, when I
think of the many, many disappoint
ments, the numberless times when I
seemed right on the point of finding
what I sought, I feel that I must have
spent a lifetime at least before I
finally did hit upon the right combina
tion —and I know that it is right, be
cause samples of the pulp and paper,
made both by hand and on a regular
paper machine demonstrate beyond
question the feasibility of cotton
stalks as a material for the manu
facture of paper of all grades, from
the light flimsy quality to the heavy,
coarse wrapping paper; and, later
on, when the wood is all gone, it is
the only material that will take its
place for the manufacture of news
paper, book paper, fine writing paper
—in fact, paper for every use.”
By this process no parts of the
stalks are thrown away. The un
opened bolls, as well as the roots,
leaves, and branches are utilized, so
that, in gathering the stalks, no cull
ing will be necessary; nor will it be
necessary to provide any special ma
chinery, the ordinary equipment of
any up to date paper mill being all
that is required.
There is no question as to the sup
ply of raw material being practically
inexhaustible. There are enough cot
ton stalks grown each year to supply
pulp for more than twice the amount
of paper we use, figured on the basis
of allowing one and a half tons for
each ton of paper.
Bulletins issued by the United
States Department of Agriculture
show that there are 24 counties in
Georgia, 29 in Alabama, and 28 in
Mississippi, each of which produce
annually over 20,000 tons of stalks.
In these States 27 counties produce
over 30,000 tons each per year. One

Financial Depressions
Periodical financial depressions distress
che country. We call them inevitable; are
they? Is there no cure? Is not the debtor
—many simply in panic to pay the creditor
—few?
The Remedy
is given in “Usury; from a Scriptural, Eth
ical and Economic Standpoint,”, in which
great book, for the first time in years, logic,
religion, theory and practice are so united
as to demonstrate convincingly that
Usury
is the cause of our recent and every finan
cial distress. The author. Rev. J. C. Elli
ott, strikes heavy blows on present systems.
Interest is the curse of business morality
and business practice.
