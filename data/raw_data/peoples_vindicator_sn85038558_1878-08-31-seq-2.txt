The Inter-Ocean.
One of the South Louisiana coun
try journals wants the lter-Oceaa's
charges against Major E. A. Burke
"answered at once." It is just such
as this which has given and will give
the Northern Radical howlers a de
cided advantage over our own people
in a political canvass.
An upstart anonymous correspond
ent writes a letter full of venom and
lies, such as Mat Wells wrote the
Chicago Inter-Oceau, and Immediately
we find a lot of Southern people who
at once begin to apologise. Here is
where that Northern "advantage"
comes in. These stories are not
credited by any Northern man of
candid mind, and they want no ex
planation or apology. The class of
Northern readers whom it effects,
growing smaller every day we are
glad to believe, never se the thousand
and one apologies written is the South,
and wouldn't believe or admit them if
they were to. So our readers will per
ceive how utterly useless, not to say
disgusting and unmanly, it is fQr as
to whine around and attempt to apolo
gize for every public man we place in
the field for office.
Major E. A. Burke's candidacy does
not effect the Inter-Oceas nor its
class. He suits the Democrats of
Louisiana, and if the North and their
Republican President-stealers don't
like him, they can lump it. Nay.
It readers E. A. Burke more dear and
popular with as all to ind him the
subject for vituperation, abuse and
slander of the Inter-Ocean, Mat Wells
and the whole brood of scoundrels.
Nothing those fellows could say will
eftect us--they are liars all; and for
Louisiana papers to "demand" that
Major Borke, a gentleman, an honest
man and the standard. bearer of the
Democracy of our commonweylth,
should "at once explain' and "re
fute" charges made by them is sick
ening, and too cowardly to contem
plate.
Major Burke is entirely too bonora
ble to stop and fondle every, car that
barks at his heels, and :life is too bu
sy and abort with him, to answer
every slander his enemies, the ene
mies of the manhood and virtue of
the South may choose to propogate.
The Democracy of Louisiana noma
nate, constitute and appoint E. A.
Burke their General, now, daring, and
for the battle to be fought next No
vember, and we are responsible for
him to a man! If the Radicals don't
like him, so much the better; it only
goes to prove his honesty, which
wanted no such evidence. As for the
Inter-Oceas, all that honest people
have to do to be right is to do just
opposite to what it says and teaches.
This is oar apology for Barke!
Smoke it !i
Radical taxation in 1874, wben the
Democracy of thisL parish lowered it
with shot guns, was Ninety Thoqand
Five Hundred Dollarsm oanually; or
eight per cent of all the property,

Democratic taxation in 1878 is
Twenty-.five Thouiad Dollars; or

State Printer and Grand Jury.
The candid minded citizen of this
section thinks great injustice has been
done Mr. Dupre, State Printer, by
B the Grand Jury of New Orleans.
If lie over charged the State for
work; if he performed services not
. allowed by law and drew pay there
for, he was indictable for perjury and
malfeasance in office, and the Grand
Jury deserves the severest censure
for not performing their duty. The
conclusion that Mr. Dupre did not
overstep his lawful duty is irresista
ble, from the fact that lie was not in
dicted.
What then are fair-minded men to
think of the whole matter t Sir"w7'
that the Grand Jury lent the"eltes
to the Lottery Company..d to the
In New Or
disappointed newspape cial capacity
leans; and in their al capacity
gave currenc seeming authority
gave .crre cI and base slander.
to a dinsgrv
l m A reason, with whom we
All men
,nversed, think just as we do;
h~f since Governor Nicholls, who
gave the subject thought, declares he
sees no way in which he can interfere,
it being a matter solely within judi
cial jurisdiction, all men must see to
what a situation the Grand Jury by
their report has reduced Mr. Dupre.
No honorable man in the State en
tertains the idea for a single moment,
. that Mr. Dupre has ever charged one
cent more for his work than the law
allowed, all sympathise with him,
while they denounce the Grand Jury
for lending their aid to the propoga
tion of a slander which must wound
deeply so honorable a gentleman as
Mr. Dupre, while he is rendered pow
erless to judicially refute it.
Some of Their Own Doings.
The Northern people complain bit
terly of Kearneyism, at least that's
the talk of the aristocratic portion of
our loyal fellow-citizens. Their de
nunciation of the very idea of "stu
pid, ignorant, propertyless whites,"
daring to rule a country, is laugha
ble to us. When scamps from the
North headed the poor, ignorant, pre
judiced negro, and plundered our
Southern people of millions, while
they murdered, raped and burned,
f these soft skinned, army contract,
"big bugs" didn't see any great wrong
in it. Because the starving whites of
the North, brought to poverty by
their greed and vicious legislation,
dare rise and assert white manhood,
these same think it a preposterous
outrage.
The Northern people are but reap
ing the whirlwind of their own sow.
ing. In their blind hatred, malevo.
lence and fury, they destroyed all we
possessed, and the means they era
played to wreck us returns to plnoo
der and demolish them.
Unlike as, they have the satisfac
tlon of knowing that they sre to be
despoiled by their own race; a race
subject to reason and imbned with
mercy. The vandals they poured
down on our fair land were ofan
alien llood, and degraded as while
plunoadering.
White Nea, to Your Posts I
The canvass of 1878 is to be the
decisive one. In 1876 we fought and
gained a victory unparalelled in the
annals of history. That victory has
only stunned the enemy, not destroy
ed him.
This year we propose his death and
eternal oblivion.
Are the gallant white men of
Natchitoches ready I
Our record is too glorious to be
marred by a single desertion; by a
single confusion in our line. Let our
private feelings, our personal animos
ities, our individual preferences be
put aside for the public good, that
we may rally as one man to the polls
in November next and scatter Radical
ism to the winds of Heaven.
The Amendments.
Somejournals are anxoious to know
whyrthe Convention af Baton Rouge
failed to mention the Amendments
proposed by the last legislature. The
Convention recognized the fact, that
the contest all along was between the
Amedments, which had their birth in
corruption and major support from
oorrupt men, on the one aide and the
call for a Convention to frame a new
and honest Constitation on the other.
They declared for the Convention,
and by that declaration more em I
phatically denouniced the Amend.1
ments than if they had deluged Lou
isiana with a sea of words.
The "coauntry press," small and in
sigpifant as Stubbe would make it, i
is moirtg npa tbe enemy. Principally,
though elad in tim demand for some
big or little olce. As soon as the
editor of a newspaper becomes aso a
ofseeseke and a candidate for ofice
we advise the public to pot as little
confidence as possible in that news
paper.
We are sorry to see men who are
nseful as editors turning out to secure
odfoi, whoe, should they fail in the ,
eap~ey of public servantsb, the peo
pie will at one. lose coantldcce in
them as joprnalhts. It's bad; and I
our confreree had better make haste
slowly i thit dcirsion.'
have but one haror of sadfty, ind a
that is in the Democnratic party. ' t
Nat Wells.
s This foselited old thief has the
a brazen affrontry to declare himself a
y candidate for Congress from this (4th)
District, on the "Independent" ticket.
r The indecency of this will strike
It most honorable men as marvelous in
the extreme. The "virtue" of the
l "Independent" has beet' pireached
a throughout this State with a vim
e which seemed to cake up its other
e short.comings; when it assails us in
it the shape o~ Mat Wells, to whom
honor, vc.ne and decency 'Are stran
gers, y excites nought but supreme
d;,ust.
The letter which this fraud indites
and publishes in We the People, a
journal of doubtful repute published
in Alexandria, La., is an appeal to
Radicals, old line Whigs, and the fag
ends of all political organizations to
rlaly to the standard of Mat Wells!
Should they do so, which we serious
ly doubt, consistancy would for once
be marked. After stuffing ballot
h boxes and committing the high and
unpardonable crime of raping the
electoral rights of a free people, for
which lie escaped punishment only
ยบ through the mistaken or idiotic mag
nanimity of the people's representa
tives, Mat Wells has the solemn as
surance to appeal for the suffrages of
the honest white and colored men of
the 4th Congressional District.
Well, well !- we hope now that, af
ter Warmouth and Wharton, Pinch
back and Anderson, and last, but by
no means least, Mat Wells, bound to
the front as Republican-anti-Demo
cratic-Independent leaders our
zealous friends throught Louisiana
will acknowledge that the VINDICA.
TOR's political sagacity is entitled to
some credit. When we differed from
the policy of Governor Nicholls, we
did so honestly. We insisted that it
f tended to galvanize a dead enemy
who was entitled to no sympathy, no
mercy, and our words are now ful
filled proprhesies. Radicalism in
Louisiana has, thanks to that mista
ken policy, not been killed, only
scotched. Happily that line is now
abandoned, and our people, thorough
ly united, will show Mat Wells and his
clew what Democrats unawed by
federal bayonets, and not dishearten
ed by the fear of ballot box stuffers
and returning boards, can accomplish.
Democracy, clad in her panoply of
eternal justice and truth; the cham
pion of the wronged and oppressed,
will crush Radicalism in Louisiana so
deep in oblivion that naught shall
remaip of it save the remembrance of
its crimes.
Mister Wells-prepare for war!
The Bourbons of the Fourth District
led by BURKE and ELAr promise you
all you can make, not an inch more!
That Coeavetion.
The Point Conpee Reaord thinks the
Democratic party of this State will
not call a Constitutional Convention.
We can't see what has got into the
Anti-Constitnional Convention per"
pie. They made their fight inside
the party and the decision has been
as follows:
That it is the sense and judgement
of this convention that the Legisla
tore of this State at its next session
should provide for the calling and
assembling of a convention at the
earliest practicable time thereafter,
to frame and to establish a new con
stitution of the State of Louisiana.
That is now Democratic doctrine
As moch as any dogma enunciation at
Baton Rouge, and those who desire to
forther oppose a Constitutional Con
vention can do so only in one way
outside the Democratic party.
It does our soueal good to hear our
friend MeCranie, of the Ooachita Tel
egraph, rejoice. Stubbs is not the
leader of the Ooachita people. He
isn't in accord with the Democrats of
this State and our friends there had
better leave him to his Railroad bonds
and to Ludeling and Ray.

FRIEND C'OSGIOVE:
After the various false rumiors of yel
low fever which were reported to exist
in your town. the truth has at last reach
edl ns Quite a panie ยบxisted in this
neighlorhlad on learning that several
d'atlhs had occurredlll in youlll town\i ftrot
yellow flver I am nruly glad that this
dreadful disease is not allong yon,
though onelo almost as fatal, if not pro
perly treatedl, is in your midst. Several
years ago )ipthcria raged fe'arfully in
lily neighborhood, especially almong the
colored people about 40 or 50 deaths oc
curred in one week. I was in New Or
leans when the disease broke o,ut on my
place; the three persons first attacked
died in three or four days. I arrived
at honle just as the ththird one was expir
ing. I immediately adopted the follow
ing remedy, whicll saved all other per
sons attacked, all thle lellbers of lly
tfamily with myself were affliceted with it.
I used 2 to 3 grains Nitrate Silver dis
solved in 3 or 4 spoonfuls water, applied
to the afflicted parts with a mlop 2 or 3
times a day. Weakening the solution
for babies. "Gargles of astringents were
frequently used during the day, such as
Alum or Blorax with honey, and strong
tea of persimmon bark or sage. Also
the well known remedy used in the
West Indies, strong vinegar, red pepper
tea, and, salt, gargling and drinking of
this, noIrishilng diet, such as strong
broths, hoiled chicken, hcef or ,mutton.
I ftip"fnt4 gave at thle beginning a
puke to stort rolilhst persons, a: d (lolloud
it qllite benelicial. I treated some 30 or
40 cases, and several of nIy neighbors
adoptel nmy treatment with perfect suc
cess. Mr. R. W. Campbell saved every
ease on his place with the above remnledy.
Since then I have frequently prescribed
the remedy without a single failure.
Stop the use of the Nitrate of Silver as
soon as the white llotches disappear:
gargle the throat clean before eating, to
prevent the further spread of tilhe virus.
Crops splendid, a feiw cate rpilars have

RINGING WORDS!
Unity and Harmony.
Burke's Address at the Convention.
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the
Convention:
I find it impossible. amid the deep
emotions which the partial action of this
convention excites in my breast, to give
expression to the gratitude I feel. Im
pressed as I am with the devotion of the
friends who have sustained mly candida
cy, and by the steatfast adherence of
tile gentlemen who hatTother prefereferences,
it will be impossible for me at this time
to do much more than express to my
friends, and the gentlemen of the con
vention at large, my thanks for the hon
or and dignity bestowed upon me.
I can only assure you that my course
shall be smeh as to deserve your good
opinion. and that I shall so discharge
the duties of the high office to which
you have nominated Inc as to vindicate
your selection
It may have appeared to some of the
gentlemen of this collnvention who were
unacquainted with the situated in our
section of the State, that my friends
have advocated my nomination with un.
due ardor. For myself I assure that I
hold the endorsement of the people of
this State high above my consideration
of emolument.
For my friendly supporters it must be
said, that they have acted from their con.
victions as to what was for the bests in
terests of the party.
We have had many dissensions in our
parish, and many of you are familiar
with the events which finally welded our
people together,and enabled us to achieve
our past sucrces. Thereareeonmany differ
ent nationalities, so many political or
ganizatsons, so many varied inlterests of
an industrial, . echanical and commer
cial charae ter, so unlike other districts,
where solely agricultural interests are
concer*.d, that our difficulties in preser
ving party unity have been greatly mul
tiplied.
Many of our people have not realized
all their expectations in thile result of our
last elections, and whilst it may be said
that a change of governmllent conl not
he expected to bring sudlden and com
plete relief or that the esoliation of some
ten years of radical misrule could be re
paired in one shoat year, and while it is
true that much has been done to remove
the burdens weighing upon the people,
it is nevertheless true that they demand
that we shall go on in tee work of re
demption. It ts true that great reforms
have been inaugurated, that we have
established an honest governmel t, pro
tecting the rights of all, and although
peace and bonesty have come, prosperity
has not followed. There are many who
do not reflect that the recovery from bad
government lmust necessarily require
time, and they are apt to lay their griev
ances upon the party in power.
These elements in the parish nf Orleans
openly threaten revolt against party
rule. They say that the Radical foe no
longer confrouts us and considerations for
their material interests rise paramount
to party discipline. The citizens of New
Orleans bear nearly two thirds of the
entire burden of the State government,
and their municipal burdens are greater
still. They look with anxiety to the ac
tion of the party in this respect. With
the dangers of dissension staring the
party in the face, knowing that they
must act with great prudence and wis
doml to retain our party supremacy, the
Orleans delegation have urged our friends
from other sections to strengthen our
hands by according Orleans the leading
norinudtbml In this campaign. It is
scarcely necessary to assure you, howev
er, that had this nomination not fallen
to the choice of my friends, we would
have gone back to our duty and given
our est efforts for the success of our
party, which can best complete the re
demption of the State. [Loud cheers
and applause.]
We have not found it strange that
other sections of the State have sought
to elevate gentlemen whose character,
capacity and integrity render them wor
thy of honor1 and we accept the nomi
nation which you have accorded ns as
indicative of a determination that there
shall no longer be any political distinc
tion between conutry or city. You will
not forget that we have been willing to
lay down our personal preferences to ee
cure unity and harmony, and I am sure
that each and every one of us will re
turn to his home determined to roll up
such a majority, that will forever set at
rest the question of the supremacy of
our party in this State, and enable as to
go forward untrammeled in securing the
reforms necessary for the happiness and
prosperity of our people. [Cheers.]
Tax Payers
Will be gratified to learn that Aun
ditor Jamel has instructed tax colleO
tor's throughout the State, in accord

bly 1878, that all paities owing back

one halfof those back taxes together
with thleir current taxes, The other
half of baek taxes will go over 'till

the same way.

OUR CANDIDATE.
What the Papers Say of Hitm.
E. A. Burke.
[Shreveport Timwes, 9th.]
We observed 'yesterda y that the ex -
citenient ovIer the dtfeat of Major Ion
cure for the nomination for State
'lTreasure'r had considerably abated.
The sobher second Ihongliht will
prompt the reflection thl:t local pre
ferences cannot always be grattiield,
and so long as there are parties par
ty disipline should be voluntarily
maintained. Thlere is a vist deal of
bosh about the "party lash" ani)d
kinliiredl ternms. For onirself we tio
not proposI to attemplit, its use. Ev ler'y
inteligent v'oter has his opinion of the
government policy that will'best siiub
serve the inltrests of the countryl, ialtd
lie is nmoraIlly bound ito vote in accir
dance with hiis convictio ns. The 1pro
vince of a party pipet is to endtvor
to confirm its friends in the faith and
and to gain as many convert as pos
sible from the other side. We hold
that the principles of the Democratic
party are the best for the South, and
that her only friends at the North
are in that party. Firmly believing
this we must warn our friends against
the evil of deserting the ticket for
light and trival causes.
Individuals may entortaini pre
judice against Mr. Burke, but we
doubt if they are well founded. We
confess to have entertained the feel
ing ourself, though also confess it was
based on an unfounded opinion. But
during a two months' stay in New
Orleans pending the contest between
the Nicholls and Packard Govern
nlents we witnessed some and heard a
great deal of his untired efforts in be
half of the former. When we saw
the implicit trust imposed in his
judgment and integrity by the lead
ing men of the party and by Gov.
Nicholls himself, we were forced to
the conviction that we had been un
just in our estimate of the man.
In manner he is courteous, quite
and unpretending, while his energy is
simply wonderful. His administrative
ability is probably superior to that of
any man in the State. His head is as
clear as a bell, and his judgment is
rarely at fault. lle did more to orga
nize the Democratic party in New
Orleans in the elections of '72 '74 and
'76 than any one else, and his infiu
ence there to-day is so great that lie
can carry probably 20t0 more votes
than any other candidate could. He
certainly deserves well of the people
of Louisiana, and we feel confident
will be elected by an overwhelming
majority, even if he has any opposi
tion.
The State Treasurer.
(Shreveport Standard.)
The convention has crowned its
work by the nomination of an em
inently suitable candidate for the of
fice of State Treasurer. The nomi
nation was made unanimous amid
much enthusiasm, and determination
evinced on the part of the friends of
each of the other candidates to give
the nominee a hearty and vigorous
support. The protracted contest seems
to have been conducted with great
fairness, courtesy and good feeling.
No bad blood was engendered that
we are aware of. Even local prejuldi
es seem to have been ignored. We
did not hear of any of that hostility
of the country to the city candidate
or vice versa, which sometimes crops
out amid the heat of the contest in
oar nominating conventions, Nor
was thete any reason for it. A Dem-n
ocrary, like that of New Orleans,
which call add 20,000 to the niajlrity
in the lare, and whilih foughtl so
gallantly alnd so persistantly in tihe
recenit struggle fer the State Govern
nient, is not only entitled to every
consideration but to the warmest
thaltks of the people of Louisiana.
Nor could the nomination have been
bestowed on a wortheier recipient.
Major Burke combines all the requi
sites for a head of the ticket at the
present time. He possesses first
talents, excellent business capacity
and a strict integrity of character.
His eminent qualifictions for ofee
may be jndged from the unanimity
with which lie was supported by the
business men of New Orleans of all
classes, and by the union of the dif
ferent "wings" of the party in that
city n hiis favoe. As a party nlan no
one is superior to him as an organizor,
nor more earnest and laborious in his
work in that capacity. In all tihe
severe and trying labors which ended,
after so long a time, in the final estab
lishment of the people's government,
Major Burke was one of the most
Irominent actrs. The recent inves
tigations of the Potter Committee
have bronght conspicuously to light
tlhe great service lie has done the
State, for which hle is entitled to re
cognition by the people, and to their
lasting gratitude.
(N. O. Picaynne)
As r-gards Major Burke himself,
we have already expressed in nninis
takable terms our indorsment of hi
conspiracy. For his past service he
deserves well of the State. We have
just had occasion to observe his con
summate skill as a political tactician;
but Major Burke is something more
than a politician, and something
more than a diplomatist. He is a
great organizer, an indefatigable
worker, and he has a thorough husi
ness training and experience which
have prepared him specially for the
dities lie will have to pertform.
Another and an importent qualifica
tion lie possesses in a certain firm
ness which will lead him to declare
himself actually, as well as nominal
ly, the Treasurer,
(N. La., Journal.)
The nomination of Hen. E. A.
Burke is cordially recieved and hartid.
ly endorsed by the Democrats of
Tensas, and we believe hlie will bring
out the strength of the party in the
forthcoming election. To Major
Burke, more than to any one man,
are the people of Louisiana indebted
for the withdrawal of the Federal
troops and our subsequent improved
condition. He is personally known
to almost every leading Democrat,
and his eminent service to his party
are known to every voter.
