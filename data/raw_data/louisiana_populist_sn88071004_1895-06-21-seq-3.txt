Dear Sver r:- coph. the following
from the Daily Picaynte of ,lens
dfou that those polt fte wi! be elld
Unitede Stre whea-t, od wthfllo wing
11th, '95, which I consider an
"eye opener": New York, dJun
loth, ex-Congres.inum Frank ,Joneo
of Portsmouth. N. II., has id st
in a carriage through the English
farming ditiict." stid he, "an, I
-found that the late frosts l.:a! kiiled
the crops there. As it result this
will make a market in England for
United States wheat, and will bing
good times for the Western farm
era. As soon as they find the
money coming for their products,
they will stope worring about free
the silver, and will become advocates
of sound money. So the silver
telintionr will be no longer the po
tisa night-mare of this country."
Mr. Editor, this makes aIt quite
ealey to ee their plan of attack
run up" American productseCe and
the silver crase will vanish. See
iwhere otton is and yo are told
te lling where itn will go "up" to,
of thee people will havet to be des
troyed, let tid cst be what it will.
pealed we heard thisos deal of
talk of "want of confidence," andi
want of confidenceh talk was
continuedu though the country was
comparaio ely quiet, and produc-n
tion toug on, and nowIt whilen
this ountry is ont the very verge of
a gret revolution we see confl
dencte rddenly restored and our
products advanctn. What o fer
meaning could thie suddenly reC -
tored confidence have, but to car
cmvent the silver move C This
trick is too transparent. and can
-be sehe through too easily to even
alightl Jar the easilver move.
