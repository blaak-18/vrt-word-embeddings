HY are women so discontent
ed with their lot in life?”
asks the versatile Dorothy
Dix in the New York Even-
ing Journal, and then answers it to
her own satisfaction by saying:
“Women are discontented because
they are weak and cowardly. A wo
man will want pretty clothes and
the things that money buys, and in
stead of hustling out and getting to
work and making the money, she
wails and laments and calls on heav
en and earth and everything be
tween, to take note of her depriva
tions.
“Women are discontented because
they are bad losers. There is not one
woman in a million that’s got a drop
of sporting blood in her veins. When
she doesn’t win out —I say it in
shame for my sex—she welches.
This is particularly true in matri
mony.
“Men have a far saner philosophy
than women. You seldom meet with
a man who feels that he has been
cruelly illused by destiny because he
wasn’t born a trust magnate or an
Apollo. If he can’t have champagne
and 50-cent cigars, he drinks beer
and smokes a pipe in peace of soul,
whereas a woman frets herself to
death trying to imitate those who
are better off than she is.”
That’s a severe arraignment of her
sex by one who probably has never
done a bit of manual work, and
whose mental labor has been made
fascinating by God-given talent,
strengthened and embellished by an
excellent education.
There is much truth in what she
says, however, and all of us have
known the different types of unlove
ly womanhood that exhibited dis
content, envy, jealousy and constant
complaining. It inspires me with
no wonder that there are such,
though, while I am filled with amaze
that there are not thousands more,
considering the upbringing given to
the sexes.
“Men are only boys grown tall.”
Why on earth can’t we realize that
women are only big girls? If we
would only let the “kids” grow up
in wholesome freedom, inspired
with the same ideals of human lib
erty and duty!
The boy is born into the universe.
The girl is born into a “sphere.” He
is given the romps, the rough and
tumble games that develop his
“sporting blood,” she is restricted to
dolls and the eternal admonition
that “nice little girls don’t make so
much noise,” “nice little girls” don’t
do this, that or the other perfectly
innocent and spontaneous thing. He
learns to associate with other boys
for their innate joy-giving dnd stur
dy qualities, she is taught to ap
praise the little rags of her girl
mates, and to be on watch against
any superficial slip in their man
ners. He is taught tolerance, she is
drilled in fault-finding. He is en
couraged to like his sex and to deal
with them on the square, she is prac
tically encouraged to treat other
girls as her natural enemies, with
whom she may be insincere, and
whom she should by all means, fair
or foul, successfully rival.
As youth and maiden, the one is
expected to work, the other is
schooled to scorn all forms of do
mestic labor as beneath her dignity

GEORGIA SCENES
By EARNEST NEAL
Oh, for the gift of Bobby Burns’
I’d write a song in praise
Os Georgia scenes and Georgia
homes,
In simple Southern phrase,
’Twould touch and charm the souls
of men,
Like his own Scottish lays.
For sure ’mong Scotia’s rugged hills
No purer life can be
Than blooms on Georgia’s varied
slope
From her mountains to the sea,
Nor cove and marsh less charming
are
Than crag and glen and lea.
Where Oostanaula’s gurgling tide
Makes music to the ear,
And fertile valleys spreading wide
Among the hills appear,
You’ll find the pious farmer’s home,
With all its inmates dear.
Here Saturday night is just the same
As on the banks of Clyde,
The Holy Book, the heavenly flame
That lit old Scotia’s ingleside,
This hearthstone ’lumes, and Jesus'
name
And love and peace abide.
The bairns or chaps, it matters not
Whatever name you give—
That little rascal at the lot
May in the White House live,
And for every scolding that he got
A nation’s praise receive.
God bless the barefoot country boy,
The home-spanked, prayed -for
kind,
That catches bird-notes in his heart
And sunbeams in his mind —•
His pants uncreased, he’ll make a
man
By nature’s law refined.
In field with fleecy cotton white,
Or green with graceful waving
corn,
In honest toil he finds delight
And "welcome each returning morn;
For well he knows how surely night
Brings rest to limbs by labor worn.
Oh, gentle sleep how soft, how soon
Thy mantle falls upon the farm!
While katydids chirp their drowsy
tune
Out in the woodlands sheltering
arm,
And the mellow light of the harvest
moon
Floods the scene with a dreamy
charm.
This is the hour when from his tree
The mockbirds varied song is
heard,
With sadness melts or thrills with
glee—
and to believe that she is a veritable
martyr if she “must go out into the
world” to earn her bread. If she
does not profess that she “shrinks”
from it, she seems a bold and des
perate character.
Above all, the marriageable young
lady is made to believe in the indis
pensable social value of being “sup
ported”, her position being nicely
graded from the champagne-terra
pin-ruby-tiara variety down to that
ignoble maintenance which indulges
but once or twice a day in steak,
with but one peach-basket hat per
season, and an intimate acquaintance
with broom and dishpan. If she was
as pretty as the next, and as accom
plished, what wonder her heart
burns with a sense of bitter discrim
ination against her when some other
woman has all she lacks, and longs
for?
3tffcrsonian
Beyond the skill of poet’s word—
What notes! What trills! What ec
stacy
Floats from the soul of the kingly
bird!
The scene is changed: the radiant
beams
Os morn-—a Sabbath morn, light
up the sky,
Sweet rose awakes from pleasant
dreams
As her bluebirds sing from their
tree nearby,
“We are glad you are up, for to us
it seems
The day comes not ’till you open
your eye.”
Dear girl, playmate of the birds and
flowers,
My Georgia Rose, the fairest of
of the fair,
The songs and blossoms of thy gar
den bowers
Fill with music and with fragrance
rare
The garden of the heart, and heav
enly showers.
Nurture truth embedded there.
Compared to thee how poor her life
That bows at fickle fortune’s
shrine!
The fashion slave, with God at strife,
To grace her hat that she may
shine
Would seize like hungry vulture rife
That gentle, trusting bird of thine.
Such is the force of artful pride,
By city belles and dames dis
played,
Dead grace bedecks without; alas
inside
Is a deader heart and a life de
cayed—
While the live bird sings, and his
sweet songs glide
Into the soul of the country maid.
I
Sweet Rose knows not of the far off
town
Where fashion queens and shop
girls reign,
Where wealth and want with iron
frown
Alike mete out less joy than pain
To dupes of pleasure, clad in velvet
gown;
To hungry, half-clad slaves of
gain.
Yet say not that her life’s obscure:
It shines against the vaulted sky,
God’s out-of-doors is her world se
cure;
Through woods and fields he. path
ways lie
In pastures green, by waters pure,
And up the mountains towering
high.
She is the victim of false training
and vulgarly false ideas for which
ages of stupid customs are responsi
ble.
Scriptural authority, as well as a
sane civilization, would make wom
an truly a helpmeet. Neither pack
horse nor drudge, but still doing
cheerfully her share as a normal hu
man being, and not the abnormal but
terfly or the grumbling grub who en
vies the froth and glitter in which
she is not allowed by Fate, or her
husband’s pocketbook, to revel.
