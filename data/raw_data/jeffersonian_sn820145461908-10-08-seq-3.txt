Edward Bolton, the wealthy Dallas
banker, sat alone, in his private office
in the great bank of which he was the
head. His face was pale, his hands
trembled, and at short intervals half
suppressed oaths and imprecations
burst from his bloodless lips. Banker
Bolton seemed in an almost ungov
ernable rage.
But three months previous his only
son, George, returned from one of the
famed colleges of the East, where he
had graduated with the highest
honors. He was received with open
arms by his proud father, who praised
his accomplishments, complimented
him in the highest terms upon his
manly appearance, and hinted that he
would one day fill with honor the
exalted position which the father
then held as the head of the greatest
banking institution in the “Lone
Star State.”
After being cooped up for a number
of years in a temple of learning,
where the conduct of students is
regulated by the most rigid disci
pline, the excitements and sinful
pleasures of a lively Western city
wrnre a revelation to the young
graduate. He first looked on in in
nocent surprise, while a feeling akin
to disgust permeated 'his breast.
Then, as he grew more familiar with
the scenes of gambling, the bewilder
ing excitements of the “free-and
easy” dance halls, and the exhibitions
on the variety stage, they seemed to
lose many of their evil aspects, and to
present to the young man attractions
which had at first escaped his ob
servation.
It soon became hinted about the
city that George Bolton was fast
developing into a “sport” of the
first water, and when at a faro game
one night he arose from the table the
winner of several hundred dollars,
his status among the sporting element
was fixed high up in the scale.
Os course, a report of George’s
actions reached the father’s ears, and
he was appalled at the information.
He summoned the wayward young
man to his private office, and, with
tears in his paternal eyes, remon
strated with him, and pointed out to
him the great vortex of infamy and
ruin into which he was being drawn.
The young man’s better nature was
not yet irrevocably calloused by sin,
and his father’s words affected him
deeply. With tears of penitence he
promised to make an effort to reform,
and while their hands were yet
clasped over the pledge a happy
thought struck the father.
“I feel, my son, that you can
escape from the terrible net which
has ensnared you, if you are for a
time removed from temptation. Why
not go to my cattle ranch up North,
and spend a few months with the
cowboys ?
“The very thing, father. I will
start tomorrow. A thousand thanks
for the suggestion.”
George had been gone two months
when the old banker fell into the fit
of rage in which we found him at
the opening of this story. The cause
of his anger was embodied in an open
"AIADCAP NT.LLIP."
Captain Jack Cralvford, "The Poet Scout")
letter which lay on the desk before
him. It was written from the Monte
Visto ranch, and the one paragraph
which had stirred up the troubled
depths of the old man’s soul ran as
follows:
“And now, father, I have some
news for you which should fill your
heart with joy, but which I fear may
anger you before you fully grasp the
situation. Mr. Stover, the owner of
the LX ranch adjoining yours, has a
beautiful daughter, Nellie, nine
teen years of age, and she is as pure
and noble a girl as ever bestowed
her love upon an unworthy man.
She is a perfect lady in the house,
refined and educated, and on the
ranch is a bold and fearless rider —the
admiration of every cattle-owner and
cowboy in northern Texas. She can
rope the wildest steel's, ride the most
vicious bronchos, shoot the rifle and
pistol with unerring aim, and in short,
her wonderful outdoor accomplish
ments have gained for her the
sobriquet, ‘Madcap Nellie.’ Not a
whisper has ever been heard against
her character for purity and virtue,
and —well, to come to the point, she
has consented to be my wife.”
“A cowgirl!” he hissed through
his clenched teeth. “A wild harum
scarum of the plains, more fitted for
the stable than the parlor! By the
eternal gods I would see him in his
grave rather than permit him to dis
grace the name I have always shield
ed from dishonor!”
When he had somewhat regained
his composure he touched a call-bell,
and a messenger entered.
“Tell Mr. Marshall, the vice presi
dent, I wish to see him.”
Tn a moment that official entered,
and seated himself near his chief.
“I am called to my Monte Visto
ranch on very important business,”
the old banker said, “and may be
absent several days.”
After some business conversation
the vice-president withdrew, and Mr.
Bolton proceeded to his palatial home
to make preparations for his journey.
The railway would take him to a
point twenty miles distant from his
ranch, from whence he "would be
obliged to travel on horseback.
• • • • • •
Mr. Bolton knew he was nearing his
destination. His thoughts were with
his wayward son, and so engrossed
was he with his bitter reflections
that he paid no attention to his sur
roundings, as the horse bore him on
and on along the dusty trail. He
was aroused from his bitter thoughts
by the deep thumping of heavy 'hoofs
in his rear, and, glancing backward,
the blood seemed frozen in his veins
at what he saw.
Less than fifty yards distant, with
head lowered for the charge, and
tail thrown aloft in rage, with fury
blazing in its fiery eyes, a huge Texas
steer bore down upon him. With a
yell of terror he struck the spurs deep
into the sides of his horse, but the
animal was wearied with its long
trip and made but a feeble effort to
escape. Affrightedly he again glanc
ed back and noted that the infuriated
Jeffersonian
brute was rapidly gaining on him,
and at the same moment he saw a
girlish figure mounted on a beautiful
black horse emerge from a gulch
but a short distance behind the mad
dened steer. He breathed a fervent
prayer to heaven for deliverance, as
he saw the girl urge her horse to its
utmost speed and dash forward upon
the trail of the crazed brute, coiling'
a lariat in her hand as she flew along.
But the furious animal was upon him,
and ere the girl could reach the spot
the long, cruel horns had impaled the
horse, and the banker was thrown
violently to the ground several yards
distant.
Releasing itself from the fallen,
dying horse, the steer tossed its- head
aloft and bellowed with rage, then,
seeing the prostrate form of Mr.
Bolton, charged fiercely upon him.
As the last faint spark of hope was
dying in his bosom he heard the
“swish” of a lariat, saw the rope in
graceful coils fall over the widespread
horns of the steer, saw the girl rider
rein in her trained horse for the
coming shock, and the next instant
the huge beast came to the ground
almost within reach of his hand, and
lay as if stunned. The prostrate man
to rise, but fell back with
a. cry of pain and the last view which
met his eyes ere consciousness left
him was that of a graceful, willowy
form springing from the saddle with
a small rope in hand, running toward
the fallen monarch of the range and
tying its four feet firmly together, as
the farmer secures the legs of a hog
to haul to market.

When the injured banker's tru
ant senses returned, he found him
self lying upon a comfortable
bed in a neat, homelike room.
The walls were of whitewashed
logs and the ceiling covered with
canvas, but an air of neatness
prevailed, and the ornaments upon
the walls, and the furniture, and the
general aspect of the apartment de
noted that it owed its tidy appearance
to a woman’s skilled hand.
Closing his eyes as if fearful he
might be awakened from the beauti
ful dream which had come upon him,
he heard the rustle of a dress near
his bed. and a soft, cooling hand was
laid upon his fevered brow. The
touch seemed magnetic in its in
fluence. The painful throbbing of
his brain almost ceased, and he was
about to fall into a peaceful slumber,
when the hand was withdrawn, and
the rustling garments retreated to
ward the door.
“Please don’t go!”
The girl quickly turned, and a look
of pleasure lighted up her handsome
face as she returned to the bedside.
“Do you feel better, sir?”
“Better? What has happened to
me? Where am I? Who are you?”
“Don’t you remember being chased
by a vicious steer that caught your
horse and threw you, and—”
“Yes, I remember it all now. And
you are the angel the good Lord sent
to my rescue?”
“Oh, I am far from angelic, I
assure you! I "was coming in from a
gallop on the ranch, when I saw the
great brute after you, and although
Blackbird is the best and fastest
cow-horse on the ranch, I could not
get up in time to save your horse.
You fainted dead away, and I don’t
know what I would have done if one
of our cowboys who had seen the
whole affair hadn’t come up. We
lifted you on to his horse and brought
you home.
“Just one word more. Where am
I, and who are you?”
“You are in a cattle ranch, and I
am the ranchman’s daughter.”
“How long have I been here?”
“This is the third day.”
“How far am I from the Monte
Visto ranch?”
“But a short distance —two miles,
about. ”
“Do you know’ George Bolton, who
is stopping there?”
“Bolton, Bolton? Oh, yes! I
believe there is a young gentleman
over there; a son of the owner, I
have heard. Old Mr. Bolton, you
know, is the rich banker in Dallas,
and they say he is just the nicest old
gentleman in the State. Why, when
Mr. Mathews’ daughter Annie died
(Mr. Mathew’s is the foreman of the
Monte Visto, you know’) that good
old man sent an undertaker and a
metallic casket clear from Dallas,
and had a lovely iron railing put
around the grave. Mr. Mathew’s just
worships the dear old soul, and I’ll
give him a good hug myself if I ever
meet him. Annie was my best girl
friend. ”
“Nonsense!’ growled the old
banker. “He did no more than any
man would do under the circum
stances. Have you any other girl
friends in this locality? Do you
know* a girl named Nellie Stover?”
“Oh, yes, I know her quite well!
Her father’s ranch joins the Monte
Visto. ’ ’
“Yes, the shameless minx! I may
as well tell you, young lady, for the
whole country will ring with it
before a week passes. I am Edward
Bolton, the owner of the Monte Visto,
and George Bolton is my scapegrace
son. I sent him up here to enjoy a
season of ranch life, and his first act
was to fall in love with a wild, rough
creature, a horrid cowgirl.
A soft hand was laid on his mouth
and a gentle voice said:
“There, there! You are exciting
yourself, and that will never do. You
really wrong poor Nellie Stover. She
is not a bad looking girl, and not a
bit rough, as you picture her.
“But she’s a horrid cowgirl!”
“No more so than the other girls
on the ranches. True, she can ride
bronchos, and she can rope steers;
but she is a lady for all that. Mr.
Bolton, I don’t want to wound your
feelings, but what would have become
of you three days ago had it not been
for a ‘horrid cowgirl’?”
The old man winced beneath this
shot, but quickly replied:
“But you are different. You are
an angel, and I owe my life to your
