R xgistsation .—Hie office for ret:is

Smith's, Latsnier Precinct, and open»
on Monday at Pineville, where it con
tinues for three days. Those of onr
town people who did not registei
while tbe office was here will do well
to go over to Pinevillo and procure
their registration papers. Tbe office
will be open here again for a week
before tbe close, but tbe necessity
for every white man to register and
vote is eo urgent and tbe duty so
solemn tbat no chance* should be
taken and everybody should register
at the first opportunity. Register
NOT PROSCRIPTIVE.
It has been cbargddori the
W hite People's Party thiiFit fa pro
scriptive and will drive front usa
large nil in her of colored voter». To
this we have often replied, that it
is not the object or intention of the
White FVople to deprive the color
ed man- of any right that is guar
anteed' to him' by the laws. It is
too well known in the history of
Louisiana politics tbat the negro
has been banded together as a race,
and the only real political proposi
tion that could continue their unity
was the apprehension that their
lilterties and constitutional rights
were in jeopardy. This has been
seduously aud persistency drilled
into the negro mind by designing
carpet baggers and white renegades
who saw no chance of obtaining
power and the spoils of office, ex
cept in perpetuating these ground
less apprehensions, and bitter pre
judices against the White race.—
Republicanism m Louisiana is the
rule of a class of political adventu
rers whose sole base object is to
gorge themselves with public plun
der under the color of law. Their
rule has continued for six years un
til all classes and race« of people
have become impoverished, the
State bankrupt, and by their
shameless frauds, thefts ami op
pression«, they have created a spir
it of discontent throughout the
land. In all this the negro, uufor
tnnately for both races, has been
the instrument by which they have
accomplished all this ruin, aud by
their nefarious teachings they have
utterly destroyed the friendy re
lationship that should exist between
the tw o races. The negro race is mit
so much to blame, as the penniless
adventurers, aud miserable miscre
ents without honor or reputation
who have been thrust upon ira, pro
tected and upheld by the Federal
bayonet. Let alone, we do not be
lieve so much tjotible would ever
have existed in the State, and had
the white people from the beginiug
not permitted these adventurers to
desecrate the soil of any parish, our
condition might have been far dif
ferent. But it is a fact that the ne
gro since his enfranchisement has
made Iiis political party one of race,
and has continually refused to ac
cept any overtures made to liiui by
us.
The White People of Louisiana
saw there was no escape, no way of
defeating the corrupt rule of a band
of thieving adventurers, but by
showing to the colored race that we
were terribly in earnest, and did
not intend longer to submit to their
spoliations, h, be better element of
the colored people have commenced
to reflect; and in some localities of
the State compromises between the
white and colored people have tak
en place, aud good aud honest men
have been nominated for office.—
Had this spirit exhibited itself m
the commencement of the cam
paign and the colored people evin
ced a desire to shake oil the cor
rupt rule of their Radical task mas
ters a different feeling might have
pervaded the ranks of the white
people.
A White People's Party Sa the
legitimate result of the conduct of
the negro. The people driven to
desperation, saw no means of unit
ing all parties opposed to tbe cor
rupt rule of Kellogg and his min
ions, except by accepting the issue
which the colored race had mode
under the teachings of his political
masters, and makeing this à contest
of honesty against corruption, of in
telligence against ignorance, and
the right of the white man for his
superiority and experience in civil
government, to control it, for the
benefit of all classes. It is not, nor
was it in tende« 1 that the colored
man »hould not join in with us to
secure the blessings of good gov
ernment, and assist iu every way
towards bringing about the great
reformations iu the St »te govern
ment that are so itnperionsly de
ruanded, tor the good of l»oth races.
The white people's party is pledged
to maiutaiu inviolate the lights of
all classes, as they exist now by the
constitution and the laws.
(7 Let uo man stand back now,
Register at
S nine time since the Board of
Direptors of the. Fair Association
appointed a Committee ou Immigra
tion, whose duty it is to suggest
the liest and most practical plan ol
inducing immigration to this par
it«h. i lie committee was not con
fined to the Board of Directors or
stock holders of the Association—
but embraced several of the liest
informed men of our palish. So far
the committee has made no report.
We wish to call their attention to
the fact, aud suggest that the gen
tlemen composing the committee
prepare and present some feasible
plan during the annual meeting of
the Association. There is no ques
tion ol greater importance to the
property holders of this parish than
that of obtaining the proper kind of
laborers, those that will sympathise
with us in every way, and assist in
reclaiming and building up the for
tunes of the State and parish. The
large bodies of land that are sus
ceptible of cultivation, are not only
unproductive to the owner, but an
absolute expense. Each year they
deteriorate in intrinsic value, the
fencing and other improvements
are subject to decay, and still the
taxes must lie paid. It is poor
economy to ex|iend large sums ^f
money each year in trying to keep
large tracts of land under fencej
which are grow ing up iu noxious
weeds and grasses. There is a su
perabundance of open and tillable
land in the parish,more than would
employ ten times the laboring pop
ulation than is now in it.
It would be wise economy to have
the great surplus iu cultivation,
at a price, if nothing more, which
would pay taxes aud make rhe,usual
repairs. It is almost iui|>ossible to
purchase small tracts of land, and
unless the land owners change
their policy, it will bo difficult to
induce white men to locate in the
parish, and what few have come in
the last few years will leave, as
they cannot be contented in any
country where it is next to an im
possibility of obtaining a home
stead. This is the great object of
every farmer to accumulate a suffi
ciency to purchase a home for him
self aud family. The short sighted
policy of not offering proper induce
ments o white men seeking homes
in our parish has already turned
from it a large number, and will
matei iully effect our future progress
and prosperity il persisted in —
These are great and vital questions
which the committee on Immigra
tion should consider, and in the
preparatoin of their report make
some suggestions that will remedy
this and other evils tbat operate
against tbe best interest ot the
Parish. We should favor a tax
diiect, through the Police Jury of
the Parish for this purpose, but
there is no law which authorizes it.
We need agents to travel for us and
give au accurate discription of the
lauds, their productiveness, the
climate, its advantages, etc. At
the same time the land owners
could make propositions through
these agents to those who are look
ing for homes.
This would bo an inducement
perhaps to some, who would like to
know the precise terms on which
they could lease or purchase lands
before immigrating to any country.
We feel satisfied that with proper
exertions, the great tide of immi
gration that is pouring into Texas,
carrying with it, wealth, energy and
civilization, could be in a great
measure diverted to Louisiana —
Hitherto the large planters have
preferred the negro as a laborer
aud just after the war, millions of
money was expended in bring ng
this kind ot laliorfrom other States.
The jiolicy proved to be a ruinous
one financially, and it is to this,
that we may in a great measure at
tribute. our political degradation.—
The white immigrant was not
sought for, no inducements offered,
and hence they turned their faces to
a more friendly clime, leaving Lou
isiana because the negro was really
preferred. To umlo what has been
done, aud make the changes essen
tial to our progress and prosperity
wili require time and au expeudi
tore of money that tbe country rwn
not so well afford. We hope tbe
committee will act and bring before
tbe people of Rapides some feaai
ble add well considered plan, which
will induce the property holders to
take bold of it good earnest.

[strictly confidential.]
To Supnrvitior» of R«giNtmtimi :
Yon are instructed to^jjstfyour
utmost endeavors to cause a full
registration of all Republican vo
ters in your parish, and to especial
ly encourage and assist the regis
tration of white Republican elec
tors. For this purpose you will
keep your office open at the Court
House for as short a period as nee
essary, and then remove to the lo
calities most thickly populated by
colored voters, and give such no
tice in advance (oî course with the
greatest caution) as will facilitate
their presence at the time of open
ing the books. The great intimi
dation and oppression now being
practiced towards these classes
render these precautions absolutely
necessary to obtain a full registra
tion and nutrammeled vote.
You will also be particularly
uireful as to the custody and safety
of your books and blanks, «special
Iy blank certificates of registration
and r< gistry books. These having
been made expressly for this elec
tion can only be replaced in case ol
loss or destruction at, great expense
as well as delay, and the fact of
their destruction or loss will un
doubtedly be commented upon b.v
the opposition press and partisans
as dereliction of duty upon the part
of this cilice aud the Supervisors ot
Registration. Your attention is
particularly culled to the weekly
reports required by the "Instruc
tioiss" front this office. You will
designate in these reports the num
ber of white and colored with their
probable political affinities to <ena
able this office to estimate approxi
mately the vote that will be cast,
aud its nature.

COMPLAINT.
We have heard no little com
plaint to the effect that the Regis
trar ot this parish has been very
tardy in meeting his appointments.
At Calhoun's one whole day or very
nearly all day was missed, and he
did not leave Alexandria on Mon
day last to fill bis appointment at
Stephens' Store until about or af
ter 11 o'clock of that morning and
could not have reached there until
2 o'clock P. M. The law requires
him to open his office at 7 o'clock
A.M., and Mr. Barrett should be
more puuctual. We are sorry to
have to complain of him in this
particular as his course has, except
in these cases, been very open and
fair, but there must, be a perfectly
fair registration all through for
both sides and the closer all par
ties follow the letter ot the law, the
better it will be for both sides.
We publish this morning an
able Editorial from the New York
Herald on the situation in Louisi
ana. We would give more for the
opinion of the Ilerald than we
would for that of a hundred of the
popiugjay radical sheets that are
howling about the " new rebellion."
The New York Times has also an
able article in our favor which we
regret we can not publish.
GP* The recent action of the Pre
sident in reinstating the Kellogg
Usurpation should not r'iscoiira>>e
tiny white man nor keep him from
registering aud voting. When we
come to claim the fruits of the vic
lory which awaits us iu November if

vote, Mr Grant will not be so ready
to decide against us as he was to put
down onr effort at, arms.

Houston Texas, »
Sept J 5th. 1874. J
Mr. Editor :
No little excitement was created
iu Houston by tbe startling news
of fighting in Louisiana. The gen
eral feeling is one of sympathy,
for the long curse ridden, oppress
ed and outraged people of tbe State
in their dire distress, and while tbe
people here admire the spirit of
long suffering, tbat baa at last
brooked the bounds of forbearance
and patience, and sought to redress
the many foul wrongs committed
against their rights and liberty,:
by driving out the usurping thieves,
yet the fear ot the results are
fraught with danger aud woe.
Ifthecrisi comes and Louisia
na asks assistance from her sister
States, I believe there are some
young men iu Texas who will
promptly respond to the call, as
against the nsuqiers, none againat
the United States. If the United
States will stand aloof, aud let the
people of the State attend to their
own govern men t, as the constitu
tion ot the United States gives
them the right to do, the tbeiv.
iug, swindling, murderers, jail
birds and scoundrels of carpet-bag
ism, w ho have befouled and poin
ted this country, so long with their
hated piesence, will be made short
work of and sent howling to where
they belong.
It is thought bv some that the
Radicals of Texas will lie governed
in future by the action of Grant iu
this Louisiana affair. It lie inter
feres with his blue coated mercena
ries to assist such renegade apos
tates as Longstreet and the cut,
pnrses of the Kellogg Usurpation,
to trample upon the necks of the
Southern gentlemen of lionisiana
and desecrate their firesides, with
the gleam of his tyrannous bayo
nets, the myrmidons of oppression
in this State will kindle the fires of
outrage b.v hounding the misled
negroes, their poor iniserahle dupes
on to deeds Af violence, that they
may ride into power again here, or
what is better still to them get pos
session again of the purse strings
of the State, country ami city treas
uries. Houston is battling now
with a load of debt, of Radical cre
ition, and is making gian5 strides
towards a prosperity that will soon
rid her of it, by the enterprise and
energy of her business men aud by
the judicious use of her capital.
Texas is too strong in the foun
dation of her democracy and her
prosperity, for any scheme of Radi
cal wrong to succeed, I believe
and offers to the oppressed ot other
States a refuge from their suffer
ings if they will come to her shores.
The inducements are the same to
the honest and honorable, who de
sire to lietter their condition, no
matter of what clime or nationality
and with outstretched arms she
bids them welcome.
One of the most liberal schemes
for the encouragement of immigra
tion has been organized in this ei
ty, nnder the management of Col.
.1. E. Foster by distribnting $146,
000 iu gold, houses aud valuable
farming lands in various portions
of tluin State. The drawing takes
place on 22d of October next, where
by purchasing a ticket for $2.00 a
person stands a chance of securing
a home for themselves and family
Col. Foster the manager, stands
high in the estimation of tbe people
hero. F. W nouse tbe wealthy
Texas Banker is treasurer, and tbe
public may rest assured that the
drawing will be fairly and honestly
conducted ou the day advertised
The Republicans of tbe 4th Dis
trict were to hold a Convention at
Waco Yesterday to nominate a
candidate, but as yet nothing bas
been beard from it.
Yours Respectfully,
TEXAS.
