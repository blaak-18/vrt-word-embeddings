WHY THERE IS NO DEMOCRATIC
PARTY.
That eighteen Democratic Senators
should have voted with Aldrich last
Thursday to take iron ore from the
free list, and tax it 25 cents a ton,
goes far towards answering the
question why there is no Democratic
party. With brains and principles
both out of it, why should it pretend
to be alive any longer? Free iron
ore was one of the cardinal features
of the Wilson bill, as it passed the
House in 1894. Two proposals were
made, while the schedule was under
debate in the House, to put a duty
on iron ore, but both were rejected,
one by a vote of 13 6 to 65, the other
by 109 to 52. The duty was put
back by the Senate, in 1894 as last
week; but this was one of the things
which President Cleveland had in
mind when he denounced the Senate
changes as a work of “perfidy and
dishonor.” Free raw materials in
general, and free iron ore in par
ticular, have been the battle-cry of
Democrats for years; but when a bill
comes up from a Republican House
making iron ore free, over half the
Democratic Senators join hands
with hidebound Republican protec
tionists to put back the duty. It is
not simply a question of iron ore:
the whole iron and steel schedule
will be affected by the decision to
tax the raw material. The pretence
of its being a revenue duty is too
pitiful. The entire estimated rev
enue on iron ore, leaving out the
Cuban product which comes in un
der the reciprocity treaty, is $127,-
000! That is a pretty thin salve for
the conscience of the recreant Dem
ocratic Senators. They might better
have frankly said that they voted at
the demand of powerful protected
interests in their States. After this,
all their talk about wishing to re
move tariff burdens and about hating
monopolies, will only show how fond
they are of being laughed at. The
force of self-stultification cannot
easily go further. —The Nation.
As between the horse thief and
the grain gamblers, we are on the
side of the horse thief every time.
The norse thief only deprives one
person of a horse and nobody goes
hungry, while the grain gambler
robs thousands of people of their
bread and causes men, women and
children to go hungry. Still the con
dition of our laws will send the
horse thief to the penitentiary, while
the man who robs the little ones of
their bread goes to Congress.—Rolla
(Mo.) Sharp Shooter.

people of the United States to the
Steel Trust at $80,000,000 yearly.
And yet sixteen Southern Democratic
Senators, Mr. Bailey being one of
them, voted a 25-cent duty on iron
and steel and thus helped to swell
the profits of the Steel Trust. —Pio-

NO SETTING IT ASIDE.
H. H. Rogers, the $50,000,000
Standard Oil magnate, died suddenly
of apoplexy last week. He was next
to John D. Rockefeller in the Stand
ard Oil Company and was the guiding
hand in overriding the laws and the
courts, but when the grim reaper
came along he was up against the
real thing. The law of nature is one
law no Federal judge can set aside
as being confiscatory, and no Su
preme court can knock out as un
constitutional. This is a law from
which there is no appeal and is no
respecter of persons. Its violators
must all suffer alike, be he vassal or
king.
H. H. Rogers filled up a wide space
with his millions in this world, but
could take none of it away with him.
He occupies no more of the earth
with the tall marble shaft above
him, than the pauper with the green
briar trailing over his grave.—Rolla
(Mo.) Sharp Shooter.
VAGRANTS.
It has been some time since Doug
las has had a clearing out of her va
grants, and would it not be a good
idea now for our officers to begin a
rigid enforcement of this law? With
in the last week two burglaries have
been reported in our city, and in one
of the cases, the burglar was seen
by the occupant of the residence, and
was recognized to be a well-dressed
white man. All persons residing or
remaining within our city should
have a job and be at work, or be
taken up to answer for vagrancy. It
makes no difference how well
dressed he may go, unless he has a
position, or some visible means of
support, or some lawful occupation,
he is a vagrant and should be dealt
with. —Coffee County News, Doug
las, Ga.
We trust that in fixing the sched
ules of the tariff Senator Aldrich and
his committee will not forget to lay
a tax on the importation of European
husbands by American heiresses. If
the honorable committee would take
off a per cent, from sugar and add a
good healthy husband tax the deficit
would be pretty well fixed up.—New
Era Standard, Kearney, Neb.
Several papers over the State are
discussing the advisability of having

It is our opinion that the State has
more officials now than are earning
their salary, and therefore cannot
endorse the movement. LaGrange

A tariff on lumber is a tax on
homes and a bounty on the destruc
tion of American forests. —Dayton
(Tenn.) Herald.
Who would ever suspect, on read
ing the iron ore vote in the Senate
recently, that free raw materials was
once a cardinal Democratic doctrine?
—Southern Home, Livingston, Ala.
The Legislature passed a bill
against the cow ticks. Now’ if we
can get the next Legislature to pass
a bill against dog ticks, seed ticks
and buying on tick we shall be in
pretty good shape for business and
picnics.—Rolla (Mo.) Sharp Shooter.
JUDGE HART’S MISTAKE.
In a recent interview Attorney
General Hart has quite a bit to say
concerning the State’s present sys
tem of taxation, claiming that it is a
“hundred years old,” and consists of
nothing more than “passing the hat
for contributions,” some contrib
uting according to law, others less
and some contributing none at all.
He calls attention to the fact that
the brunt of the burden of support
ing the State government now rests
upon those who desire to comply
strictly with the law and that they
have to suffer for the wrongs of
those who misrepresent the valua
tion of their property.
As a remedy of these evils, Judge
Hart suggests a State board of equal
izers and a board of assessors in each
county.
We are in full sympathy with the
attorney general in his desire for an
equitable system of taxation, but
would not his remedy be worse than
the evils complained of? We are
convinced that it would.
If this action was taken, it would
create several hundred extra offices
in Georgia, an already office-ridden
State.
This would add to the expense of
the government several thousand
dollars per year, and even then it is
seriously doubtful as to whether the
conditions would be materially ben
efited.
We believe that the evils of the
present system result largely from
the injustices of the taxation laws
now in effect.
We wish to call attention especial
ly, in this connection, to the double
taxation which property is frequently
made to bear by reason of the exist
ing laws. For instance, when a per-
son buys a piece of property from
another on credit, the purchaser
must give some security for the debt;
so he delivers his note to the person
from whom he is buying the prop
erty. The purchaser must pay tax
on the property; the person holding
the note must pay tax on it—which
is equivalent to a double taxation on
the property.
It seems to us that such a system
is unjust, and that the Legislature
should remedy it as soon as possible.
This is unquestionably one of the
reasons why the full valuation is not
returned in many cases—they are
simply trying to dodge the double
taxation.
The Legislature will be in session
in a v ery short while and it is earn
estly hoped that it will not adjourn
without giving us some relief along
this line.—Whigham (Ga.) Journal.
