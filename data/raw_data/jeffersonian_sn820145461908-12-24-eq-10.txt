LISSY KIMBREW’S CHRISTMAS.
(Continued from Page Three.)
would you go back with me to the
dance.”
Lissy laughed out suddenly and
happily. “Well, you just walk right
in and get yourself warm,” she said
hospitably. “That was mighty kind
of you, Hart, to think of cornin’ after
me —and Icy May there and all.”
Hareley entered with alacrity.
Drawing off his coat and going to
ward the fire, he looked at her in sur
prise. “Icy May who?” he asked'
in a slightly bewildered tone. “Oh
—lcy May Shuttles! Yes, she was
"thar. I noticed her when I was ask
ing your stepmother about you, Lis
sy. Who’s your company for to
night?”
They stood together before the
hearth. Lissy looked up at him with
eyes full of a child’s trust. “I rec
kon you are,” she whispered. “Oh,
Hart, I just felt so awful when paw’s
wife wouldn’t let me go to the dance
over at you-all’s house! She said
there wasn’t room; but there was—
with a little scrougin’. And any
how, I’d ’a’ been willin’ to walk
every step of the way, or hang on be
hind like we used to when the
wagons passed the school house, do
you remember, Hartley—do you re
member?”
Did he remember? What other
memories had been so dear to him out
on the big, wind-swept plains where
his Texas ranch was? What memo
ries indeed had brought him home to
the mountains this Christmas night?
He looked down at the girl and noted
how his little gift, the blue breast
pin, rose and fell above her uneven
breathing.
“Oh, Lissy!” he said, stretching
out half timid arms to her, “was all
them things yo’ stepmammy said
just tales ? Who did you dress up
for this evenin’? She ’lowed there
was somebody goin’ to ask yo’pappy
for you right soon.”
Lissy laid both hands in Hartley’s
and was gathered close in his arms.
“Well, maybe there is,” she whis
pered smiling tremuously up into his
face.
But the snow which had muffled
her lover’s approach made soft going
for the wheels of another wagon, and
Lissy pulled herself free from Hart
ley’s detaining arm at the sound of
steps which came up and across the
porch, the noise of querulous voices
that asked and answered. These com
ers did not stop to knock, but' flung
the door open and came blinking in
to the room, shivering and stamping
from the chill and darkness outside.
“Well, we had our trouble for our
pains,” the stepmother announced
sourly. “Hartley Eversole, he took
his foot in his hand and lit out be
fore the first dance, and Icy May she
got the toothache so bad that we-all
had to turn around and fetch her
home. What you got your best frock
on for, Lissy? That’s the way with
you young gals, run through every
thing you’ve got, and ruin it, if a
body turns their back.”
Beulah and Vashti Shuttles now
straggled in, leading between them
the afflicted Icy May, whose jaw they
had been rubbing with snow to get
up a counter irritation.
Zsl)fc Jeffersonian
“Thar he is,” cried Vashti, star
ing amazed at Hartley, and Icy
May began to cry.
<‘Hit’s my jaw. Le’me alone,”
she said ungratefully to her sister
Argentina, as that lady whispered
some words of comfort while she set
tled the spoiled baby of the Shuttles
family in a seat beside the fire.
“I’m mighty sorry Miss Icy May
is sufferin’ so,” Hartley began po
litely. “Hit’s too bad you-all had to
leave the dance. They’ll miss you
greatly. ’ ’
“Yes—folks was a-missin’ you,
time we come away,” said Argentina
dryly.
Gideon Kimbrew in putting up his
own horse had found that of Hartley
Eversole tied in the shed. He now
made his appearance, beaming with
good will and hospitality. Hartley
shook hands with his host effusively,
though it had not been half an hour
since he greeted him last. “I was
just passin’ along here,” he said
finally, “and I seen the light in the
winder, and I knowed in reason that
some of you-all was at home, so I
stopped in and thought I’d stay till
you got back, Mr. Kimbrew, because
I wanted to ask —you see I’m a-goin’
back to Texas next week and I aimed
to take a —” Again he broke- off,
leaving the sentence unfinished, look
ing about him on the eagerly expec
tant faces of the women, giving one
swift glance to where the blue bow
trembled in Lissy’s dark curls as she
sat quite turned away staring into
the fire.
“You see hit’s a heap better for a
ranchman to have a wife out there in
Texas,” he began again.
“There is them in Texas,” Hart
ley pursued earnestly, evidently feel
ing that he must give his wooing a
practical cast since he had to share
it with so many comparative stran
gers, “there is them out thar in
Texas that says a ranchman cain’t
git on nohow without he’s wedded;
and I aimed to ax ye—l aimed to ax
ye—”
Mrs. Kimbrew with sudden under
standing. “Course you ort to ask
pappy—by rights; but Gid here is
most like a father to Icy May and
Vashti and Beular, and there ain’t
no ’ reason why you shouldn’t ax
him.”
“Well, then. Pap Kimbrew,” Hart
ley spoke out in a good round tone
at last, “me and Lissy has been as
good as promised ever since we was
chaps in school, and if you’ll give
her to me we’ll be wedded this Christ
mas, and I’ll take her back to Texas
with me. I’ll shore do my best by
her, and—”
As he strode forward and took the
girl’s hand in his, turning her to
face her father, he became aware of
a strained curious quality in the si
lence about him. “Air ye goin’ to
say yes, Pap Kimbrew?” he persisted
boldly.
“I shore am that —and give ye my
blessin’,” said old Gideon feelingly.
But Icy May had tottered to her
feet, clasping- her countenance with
both hands. “Oh, my jaw!” she
ciied. “Hit’s jest fairly a-jumpin’!
