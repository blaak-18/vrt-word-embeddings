exception of a few men here and-there
at work on the ore piles, or--checking'
the -fow of water in the subterranean
passages all of the great mines of the
ranee have been idle since early last
summer. .To appreciate this statement
it is only necessary to state that these
idle mines shipped ten million tonse of
ore to the'iron markets last year!
There Is a picturesque background
to this setting of abject poverty and
humah misery. Contrast the eon
ditions of -to-day with the Gogebie of
four yearsaago. Then the eyes of the
civilised world were turned on this see
tion of country'that had suddenly be
come a great commercial and indus
trial center. The primeval forest gave
way to bustling towns and great and
important mining settlements as the
morning mists before the noonday sun.
In the course of a year after the dis
covery of the original Colby and other
of the famous mines, the pine forests
had disappeared and towns of great
importance had sprung up. The Colby
mine is now known as the Norrie, the
greatest iron producing and shipping
mine in the world, a proud distinction
indeed. Fortunes were mpte in a'day
and millionaires were as thick as sand
flies. Thousands of men found em
ployment in building the towns, in de
veloping and working the mines and in
sweeping away the forests. It was an
era without parallel in the develop
ment of the country. Carpenters and
artisans commanded the highest
wages, miners were well paid, and in a
few months' time thousands of men had
been attracted to the new Eldorado.
Times were prosperous, money plenty,
speculators reckless and great things
.were planned. The inevitable hap
pened--new iron fields were opened,
the price of iron declined, the mine
o*fers combined to reduce high pres
sure-expenses, the speculators failed,
the "nanshroom iron kings" collapsed
and business men came in to take their
places. The palmy days were over.
Things ragl along in this way until
last summer, whten the panic came and
the very bottom fell out of the Gogebic
boom. This in brief is the rise and
fall of the iron community, and ex

plains in a measure the elements that
contributed to the present deplorable
condition of the range- and its people. I
Miners as a rule are an improvident
class. They never prepare for the
rainy day. They spend their money
freely. as do most people whose lot is
especially hard, and when a great
trouble comes they are in no condition
to combat with it. They are in a
measure helpless, being without trades
or professions, and cannot make their I
salt as farmers or lumbermen. If the 1
Gogebic mines do not resume opera
tions in the early spring. it is most
likely the state officials will have to
furnish means of transportation to
these people to other and more favored
localities. They cannot exist on the I
natural resources of the country with
the mines idle. G. H.YENowIsE.

ink stains on their thumbs. So, hav
ing nothing requiring their attention,
they all looked at me, and I felt as
comfortable as we do in those dis
tracting nightmares when we roam
through dignified assemblies looking
for a quiet corner where we can put
ouriclothes on. They kept on chewing
with a gentle and rhythmical move
ment which required no conscious di
rection and left their minds free to
consider my claims -to personal beauty
and engaging manner.
And then, suddenly, the entire eight
hundred took their eyes off me, and
forgot that I was alive. It was the
only thing that could have made me
feel worse than I felt when they were
looking at me, and it accounts for the
tinge of bitterness which may be de
tected in these lines. A man must be
older and more philosophical than I
am before he can endure with patience
the humiliating reflection that not one
girl in eight hundred prefers him to a
plate of ham and beans.

and at last discovered a place at the
far end where there were a few tnen.

on the other. I fell into the chair, and
instantly found myself face to face
with a haughty typewriter girl who, in
our elevator, has frequently repulsed
with scornful eyes the advances which
Heaven knows I did not make. I
stole a glance at her to see whether
she could still find it in her heart to
crush me, humbled as I was, in the
presence of so much youth and beauty.
But she lifted her cold gray eyes from
her griddle cakes, and looked at some
thing' which was immediately behind
me. I do not know what it was, but I
could feel her steely glance pass
through me with the cold precision of
a sealpel. And yet she is not destitute
of human sentiments. I have heard
her converse with the elevator boy in
such moving tones that he has run by
four floors where business men waited,
swearing, to be taken down in the car.
And I have occasionally seen her gaze
into the mirrors in the car with other
purpose than to contemplate her own
lovliness. I have even thought that
she was looking at me, but, alas, it
was always when I hadn't shaved for
four days.

had never seen it done before. He
wiped that table till it was so smooth
that the dishes could hardly stand on
it. And not a crumb, not a bean, not
an atom of pie was .spilled upon the
floor. It all went into my lap, every
morsel of it. He even brushed the
grease spots of a previous season off
the mahogany cn to my pantaloons.
He is positively the sloppiest man that
ever raised the price of benzine, and
he should command a high salary in

her on my back. She laid some tht.gs
down on the table. Some of the thinzs
she put aown with her left hand, which
was on one side of my neck, and some
with the right hand, which was on the
other. She was in such a hurry with
the teaspoon that she snapped it up
my sleeve and it disappeared. I pro
test that this was not my fault, and it
was only a pewter spoon anyway, but

My eyes fell before this concentrated
fire. I bowed my head, not in defer
ence wholly, but with the idea of get
ting my chin low enough to cover the
necktie. As I did so I saw, with the
corner of an eye, this notice on the
wall: i

It fitted my case exactly, and yet
the promise involved in it seemed s
to be scantily fulfilled. I began
to open some eggs with a trem- a
bling hand. A large piece of c
the shell fell into my glass. I tried
to fish it out with a spoon which. such
was my agitation, knocked against the
glass like one of those tappers in a shop
window, inviting people to come in c
and be robbed. Then all the girls a
shifted their gaze from my necktie to
the piece of shell. Under such circum
stances, I was not likely to catch it. j
"Let me send it back and get you
another,'" said a kindly voice behind
me. It was the male superintendent t
of the establishment, an exceptionally t
polite and obliging young man. I had
never been so glad to see a male of my
species before. It brought my courage
back. I arose and abused that gentle
youth for every fault of omission and
commission known to the restaurant
business. He took it with the bland
est courtesy. Suddenly, grown brave,
I turned to see what effect my asser
tion of dignity had had upon the girls.
They were all gone. One o'clock had
struck and they had gone back to ham
mer some more holes in our language.
Perceiving this, I apologized meekly to
the superintendent, and then sat down
and ate the cold egg, shell and all.

THE PQMAKS.
Mohammedlen.Among the Bulgaraeas ot
Rhodope.
Who on earth, or what on earth, are
the Pomaks? is the question which
will suggest- itself to most of those
who glance at the heading of this arti
cle. The Pomaks are Blulgaroph9ne
Mohammedan Bulgarians; that is to
say, they are Bulgarians who have
adopted the creed of Islam, but re
tained their own language. With their
native speech they have preserved cer
tain usages and customs of their own
race, thus affording to the ethnologist
an admirable field for speculation as
to the extent to which a change of re- 1
ligion, unaccompanied by other influ
ences, can modify the ingrained char- c
acteristics of a nation.
There are Pomaks in many parts of ]
Bulgaria; but the Pomak territory par
excellence lies in the wildest, remotest I
region of the Balkan peninsula, in the
]heart of Rhodope, a terra incognita to <
