for the siterl , whiilO letplllkelld his ad- It
Bnt ces.and he hai declared i his ti
rage that, unles t she con ented to his P
proposals oi the foll' Si' lwi nlt to ils
lie woul carry her oilt by force, and ii
cause her mIIIther and blrother to he Ii
execuIted. IThe lad in the exti eti ty ,
of his terror had made his waty out of li
thecity past the sentinel and the lines, r
gIl lied i en All~u el() Iit-all (1111 p f i iit 10
gained the Ameliean camp, and now
Ibesiuogilt the Gclnerall to save his sis- t
ter and mother. The ardent, soul of t
Shields (who 1was thein but thirty- e
seven) was fitred at the thoughl t tof P
the lmiserable faite awaiting these 1hap t1
less ladies, iand 1 itillhout comun i icat -
ting at all with lle iauliarters (where
flat lrefusal would have beenl certain)
lIe lot m1ed a plan for their rescue.
i To call it rsh, Quixotic or daredevil t
would be the tlruth ; the lest dlefenlse t
of his proceedings of that night is
that it wast a brave act, lprompted by i
a generous heart, and that lie sue
eededl perfectly, where disaster would
insure his dismissal from the army.
ie had about 400 plickedl man of his 1
commiand detailed, and after brieftly
Iinforming tlhei what he proposed to t<
Ido lie fo nud every nuau eager for the h
adventulre. Putting himself at the
head of tilhe little column lie silently
left the Amerisan'lines, and favored j
by darkness of the night, approached 1h
close to the walls of the city without
discovery. Thie sentinesl could be
plainly seen on the walls, and the tu
CtIy, "Sentinela alerteI" was hieard ast
it passed from mouth to mouth,
Guided by the lad the party scaled
the wall at a favorable pilace, and t
seizing two or three of the astou- t
ished sentinls descended into the
city, and quickly made their way tiu
opposedn t hrough the streets to tlhe
iollne wh lich thie lad guided tihem.
The bov ran ill and informed the
ladies that deliverane halld conie ;
I they hastily collected a few valuables
and articles of wearing appiiel inl
a bundle,, and placing the rescued
party in thle centre of thie column,
Shields started to return. But mean
time the alarm had been given, and
the dirums were beating and lauters I
tflashingl all around the walls. At
rived near the point of entrance, it
was found that the whole open place
between thle hiouses and the wallwvas
filled with Mexican infantry and ar
tillery. Shields instantly deiployed
and gave theil command to fire. A
rattling volley followed by a bay
onet charge, threw tilhe Mexicans into
disorder, and tile Americans rushicie
tlhrough 01nd over thlem with thcir
little party, imalde tileir wa3- out, and
returned to tiei' own camp with but
a few casualties- althongh they drew I
the fire of both sides on their retuin,
for tile Amlericani caimpi was now ful
ly aroused, and the pickets were flu-ma
Ii rapidly. But tile tuniult soon ceased
on both sides, the adventur-ous sol
a- Ss retur-ned to fileir quarters as
h houghl nothing 1had( ha ppetned out of
tile usual course, and tile ladies were
safely bestowed for the night in a
- but made as confortable as possible.
How lie was called upon to account
for this night's work will be best told
in General Shieids own language:
"Tlhe next morning an officer of
General Scott's staff came ,to my
t, quarters with a message froam the
k- General that lie would like to know
er the cause of tihe pireovious night's
of alarm, as it ot-iginated in that part
ts of the line which was under my com
(1 manu(d. I aI'sweCr'Ct tlat I would re
so ort in persoii, which I at once did,
ie On the way I thought the matter
*c. over, and concluded that It would be
g- better to mlake a clean breast of it,
and I did so. The story tllre Gen
- oral Scott into a tremendous rage.
Ever since Cerro Gordo was fought lie
had addressed me as 'My CeiroGordo
flielld,' but he now dropped that
fanmiliar name. 'General Shields,'
I,) he thlundeied, you are insubo-dinato
and reckless in tile Iliglhest degree.
You have put in peiil the fruits of
the whole cnmpaign ; you have per
haps frustrated all my plans for the
- captnre of the City of Mexico I Sir,
I'llKdisg-ace you; I'll court-martial
you, and have you dismissed the ser
vice!' At this my temper rose, and
I answered hlin¶ plainly that le might
ed court-maitial, and perhaps get me
ke dismissed, but that after all that had
id occurred on this campaign neither he
nor any other man could disgrace
me; and, being by this time pretty
well stirred up' I said that under like
circumstances I would do precisely
the same thing over again. Instead
of being more angry, the General was
'V rather eoitened by this speech. 'I
was wrong, Gen. Shield,' he said 'in
saying that I would disgrace you, I
ask your pardon for that. You are
a brave man, and disgrace is not the
word to use toward you. But you
es are greatly to blame in this matter,
sir. Yon have acted without orders,
and have imperilled the whole cam
paign.' 'General Scott,' I said, 'be
fore you say anything more about it
c suppose you come over to my quar
T: ters and see these ladies.' After
,x some further talk hle pronmsed to do
so, and I rode back to my tent pretty
- well eatisfied that I should. have no
further troubcle %x ith the afniair. Ini
an hour over cante General Scott,
aind(l I at ouce inctroduced him to tle T
ladiies. ThLe ilanghter teas ai pi(lure
t1
pldtShiiitiii ithe trinrl -or thid

looked floa hter to use wIn :t iii- i

('erro Goldo fl lendl, if get you cort- ti

that long aterivaid, when the war I iii
was overt anditl we h:d returned to Ii
The0 V'itecd r ates t, I I eceived fro o

their gratitude." ui
'ITcse are nut a few of the interest- in

which leni ral shields entertains his
listeners in putlie and private. For

Burch's Crooked Ways. ti
Tlhle Baton tiilouge A dRo'iC te gives I'
the followitig account of Barchl's it
tran sactions iin school funds: w
J. Henri Bllch, who has been play- w
ing Senator for this lparish, though w
not a rsidentt thereof, nl uinig the ti
past threeIL years, was airrested in New se
rleans Tuesday evening biy Sheri rtl
Otle~iB·~c '1iiot e~·~r sn u lt I 3d
Iliothl, and plajced in the Pa lish Pais- l
on nicil the next day, when he wats i
to start with his prisoner for Baton
Iloiuge. Early next im rning Bni ch I
made an effort to get icreleased on a ti
writ of habens corpus. When our 11
informant left Newt Orleans the case r
had not been ldecidedC. Burch had e
writteni to Mr. ilis. trceasurer of v
the school hoani, thaint lie was ready i
to settleI, anid that if lie wonld coltie it
to New t us for I hat oupose lie it
(Bitnch) would pay all expenses. At v
ter coisnltinig with the President of
the School Bocard. )M. Willis decided ti
toi go dowin and receive w hatever ti
hiurch had it tut over and report at b
once tG the hoard. Accordingly lalt g
Sunday MIr. WilIis went down, and i
whe can le lle on me tche found the. e
defunct Treasrei n oiti iiearerit prepared i
to settle than thlie earthis ti then ioton. I
Upon examination M1I. Willis found c
that. for the iyears indicated in the c
circular of Mr. Lusher, Burch had n
received about $19,741 53, and that t
his voucherl s showed ohe had paid out
only about $53,2 and somte odd cents. n
Besides this, in these years Burch had I
received from the parish about 7875,- 3
54, makinug in all about $27,617 05. 1
According to these figures and I
Butrch's vounchers there appears to be C
a deficit of about $18,OK). Burch
claims to have made a settlement I
with Win. G. Brown, ex-Superintend- a
ent of Educatioc, during thto Month e
of May 1877, for the years previous a

we can collect some other faicts we

Many of our readers will retmember pi
the featfl hut ricane which sweplt oil
over Ohio andl the States lcin~g to the cr
iv(st i til rds far as lowa itn Jtne, of is
the year 1 g0I. The i olence of the
wind which at tended this great storm, it
was declared by many to have been i rii
without a patallel. Great dcstrul- wi
tion to trees, tclops, iroofs, and yes- is
sels, and 1some loss of life were the at
results along the h11toad track of Ithis tn
tempest, reaching in hidth for nmany in
mtilets.
In the year 186:, tremendoius gales l1
swept across the American lakes and w
Ithle Atlantic coast, from the 6th to Ilt
the I Ith oiif Jan tary. The same hur- n
rienne reached Eirope, and the steam- of
ir Anmelia went downl with a cargo d
valued at 1,0UI4),(4J0. Many wrecks hi
and great loss of life were weported
itn various countries, showing that alln
uni sui a it tospheric pcrt tion tper- li
vaded thle globe at the samue i tie. al
A frightfully destructive storm was
the tropical hurricane which struck rit
the coast of Nova Scotia with teiri- dI
ble fury on the '2lth and 25th of Au- mi
gust, 1l73. The loss of litfe wa tI
Ifightftl, and that of property was Ii
estimated at the time from four to tli
five nillions of dollars. About ninme a
hundred hlonses were destroyed, the i
damage done to wharves and crops 13
could scarcely be calculated, and tIhe
number of vessels known to have
been destroyed during the 24th antd i
25th of August was 1,0;32. In the p
neighborhood of the Gulf of St. i
Lawrence and the Atlantic shores of ql
Nova Scotia anid Newfoundland the c
loss of life was not proportionately tl
large, being estimated at less tlhan p
five hundred in all. tI
It is notable that the month of Junie, o
1871, was prolific in thunder and rain is
storms, especially in the Western c
States. The 6th of Jnnie there was
an awful tornado at Eldorado, nran t
5s15, that neartly destroyed the whole A
.town. On the 18th, at secreal potints h
u in Wisconsin, violent and destire- It
