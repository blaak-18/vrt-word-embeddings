Som e Facts About Newspapers.
There ia perhaps no subject with which
the general public have so much to <lo as
they haw with Newspapers about which
they are so ijjnorant s with whoso secrets,
if me may so express it, they are so unac
quainted. They read newspapers, sub
scribe for them, sometimes pay for them
and sometimes do not, advertise in them
iind depend upon them to keep them in
formed as ta What fa jpiugon in the world,
but as to th* different ateps taken in its
manufactura, aa to the cost of the material
lined etc., tbcy are as a general thing
wholly ignorant
It serves <mr purpose right now in con
nection with tht filing of our subscription
rates at $2*0 a year, to explain our rea
sons for soloing, lost our readers should
suppose peihapa that we propose to fur
nish a poor article for a eheap price.
Newspapers, and more particularly coun
try newspapers, bave three sources of rev
enue: tbeir subscription lists, their adver'
tisements, embracing under tbis general
head, marriage and death notices, editori
al notices and all other matter that ap*
pears in their columns tor which they are
spflcialy paid, «nd job work.
The subscription list is dependent npon
too many rnrcnm stances to receive any
particular notice here at our hands, among
tiiem we may mention the popularity of
the Editor, the character and politics of
the paper, its location, the stringency or
abundance of money etc. We will do the
people of Rapides the justice of saying
that they are a reading public and that
othey have gencronsly supported us in our
new Nowspaper enterprise and wo believe
that numbers of them who do not take a
local paper are prevented from so doing by
the high price charged for (subscription.—
▲ year or two ago the price of the yearly
subscription to the Louisiana lemocrat
was Flee Dollar » and when we started the
Caucanan in March last we found it to he
Hour Dollar # which is still the priée. It
was then, as its readers will remember, hut
a small twenty column paper, much
smaller than the present size of the Can
canin". We fixed our price at $3.00 and
$1 r »0 for six mouths, and now propose to
reduce it to $2.50 for a year and $1.50 for
six months. The extra 25 cents adôed to
the half of $2.50 on the six mouths sub
scription is for the trouble of keeping t he
separate accounts and it is just the s:nne
trouble to keep them for six months as
for a year, etc.
for a year, etc.
Now let us see how we will rome out
with our subscription price at. $2.50. For
(hat sum the subscriber will get fifty-two
papers. The blank paper costs for the
si/.e we use about $4.00 per ream. In a
ream there are 20 quires or 480 sheets. It
is now an easy matter to find the exact
mst. A simple division will give l »'ss than
one cent for each sheet and exactly 4"
cents fur the 52 sheets used in one year.—
The ink used on tho fifty-two papers prob
ably costs the other seven cents, to make
up the whole cost of paper and ink at 50
rents per year. Let us now suppose that
'MIO papers are published each week and
that the printer's wages are $'25 GO per
week. This would make in the aggregate
$1300 for the year. For the 300 papers the
subscription at $2.50 would be $750.00—
Fifty cents for each paper or $150.00 we
have already found it. will take to buy pa
per and ink. This leaves us $000 with
which to pay the $1300, so t'iat tho paper
finds itself looser by $700. Nor does this
include any mention of several very im
portant items, such as interest on the cap
ital invested iu the printiug material, pay
for the Editor for his labor and the loss
froin wear and tear. If such a paper then
had ouly 300 subscribers and no other
soiirce of revenue, it would lose conside
rable money. But now let us suppose
that instead of 300, the paper has 1000
subscribers. This would give us $2500 at
$2.50 each. Deduct $1300 Printer's wages
and we have left $1200. Deduct $500 for
cost of paper and Ink, and we have on
hand $700. Let us say that wo will give
the Priuters the odd $200 for tho extra
trouble of working the press for the 1000
papers per week, the type setting would
bo tho same, and wo still have $500 left to
pay the Editor for his work and for inter
est Ac.
A paper having such a circulation would
•f course have a monopoly over all papers
within its range with smaller circulation,
and could reasonably expect to receive for
Vts advertising tho year, say $1200 Cash.
With its increased circulation an<l adver
O tisements, would come the run of the Job
Work offering, and it would not be unrea
sonable for it to calculate upon making a
profit of at least $500 from that source.
This won Id give $2200 to the Editor, out
of which he must pay incidental expenses
Hot mentioned above, and for interest Ac ,
new material, bad accounts Ac. Say, in
round figures $1500 profit to the Editor,
when be is at the same time Proprietor,
The New York Sun charges bnt $1.00 a
year, and has a circulation of 70,000.
This probably pays all its expenses and
leavea it its immense list of advertise
menu for clear profit. On a much small
er scale, we propose to run the Caucasian
npon the idea of the X. T. Sun. We want
1000 Subscriber« by the 1st of January.
It remains to be seen whether we will get
them.

GPln severing onr Editorial
connection withjthe two gentlemen
who with us started the Caucasian,
Messrs Geo. W. Stafford and W. F,
Blackman, wo must express our re
grets at the necessity which com
pelled them to withdraw from their
association with us asEditors. The
paper was originally intended for
the campaign only, and r.ow that it
is over, their business arrangements
do not permit them to go on with
us in making the paper a perma
nent institution.
The planting interests and his
duties as Legislator elect of Mr.
Stafford and the law practice of
Maj. Blackman, do not allow them
to give the time required to edit
eveu so small a paper as ours. We
shall miss their valuable assistance
and will ever retain a sense of the
obligation we are under to them for
their kindness and the uniform
courtesy and consideration which
lias characterized our editorial iu
tercourse. The Caucasian owes to
them, to their popularity and abili
ty, the position it now occupies, of
being able to consider itself on a
sufficiently firm basis to continue
its course with the hope aud assur
ance of success.
Tiie Rapides Cemetery Asso
ciation .—This Association propose
to have .1 Fair, for the purpose of
raising funds at some time about
the 15tli or 20th of December. The
Board of Directors are to meet to
consider the subject on Thursday
next, tho 19tli inst., at tho Town
IIall , at 10 o'clock A. M.
They earnestly appeal to all per
sons interested to meet them there
at that time. They particularly
request the presence ot the ladies
as the principal labors will fall
upon them, and they will have to
make tho arrangements. Nearly
every family in the parish have re
lations interred in the Cemetery
grounds and the Directors earnest
ly call upon all to aid this enter
prise which seeks to remove the
disgrace to the whole people of the
Parish, which the dilapidated con
dition of the graveyard inflicts
upon them. They implore persons
interested to meet and consult with
them on the affairs of the Associa
tion at their meeting on Thurs
day next.
A Bank .—There is a good open
ing here for some capitalist with,
say $10,000 to start a bank. We
are greatly in need ot such an in
stitution, and it would undoubted
ly pay well. If somebody will
take our word for it and start here
on a capital of ten thousand dollars
and don't make $2500 clear money
the first year, we will—well—we
will always think he "had ought'r."
We are going to have prosperous
times, now that our State is in the
bands ot her rightfnl rulers, and
we want to see our town have all
the advantages possessed by oth
ers. When we get a Telegraph
and Bank then we will agitate the
