idea that happy. He
wondered and wondered what the
cause could be. After awhile he was
enlightened.
Brezentine was a drunkard. At
first Millie tried to guard this as a
secret, but it soon became too plain
to admit of further attempt at con
cealment. The poor girl seemed to
be nearly heartbroken, and her fath
er and mother, realizing that they
had made a mistake in so readily
giving their consent to the marriage,
endeavored to make the best of it.
Sometimes, even when the weather
was cold, Brezentine would leave
home without having cut any wood,
and, not infrequently, Big Lige, who
often strolled over in the direction
of the son-in-law’s house, would
cheerfully perform the work which
the husband had neglected. Once
Mrs. Petticord acknowledged that
Brezentine was not even “fit to tote
water.” The old man sighed discon
solately, but Big Lige, who sat near,
scraping a powder-horn, remarked
that every man should have a chance,
and that it was not right to condemn
him without a fair trial.
“Big Lige, yer talk like yer ain’t
got no sense,” Mrs. Petticord
snapped. “A month or so ago yer
’lowed he wa’n’t fittin’ fur nuthin’
but ter tote water, an’ now yer
wanter take up fur him. I ’spise to
see a man so shifty.”
“Wall, wall,” said the old man,
“don’t let’s argy ’bout it. Yer wuz
on yer head, mur, tell yer got her
married off, an’ now yer air on yer
head ’case yer p’int wuz gained. I
never seed such a thing ez a woman,
nohow. One day yer think yer kain’t
live with her, an’ the next day yer
know yer kain’t.”
“Pap, fur the Lawd’s sake don’t
fuss. Yer put me in min’ uv a set
tin’ hen a-peckin’ at everything that
comes a-nigh. Thar ain’t nothin’
that’ll please yer, nothin’ at all, noth
in’ on ther face uv the Lawd’l-migh
ty’s yeath.”
“Wall, wall, we won’t argy,” re
plied Mr. Petticord. “’Pears ter me
like it’s all argyin’ an’ no work roun’
this yere house. I never”—
Millie burst into the room. “Oh,
pap!” she exclaimed, “they’ve come
an’ tuck Jim Polk!”
“Whut’s the matter, gal?” the old
man cried. “Mur, git outen the way
an’ quit yer foolishness.” Mrs. Pet
ticord had thrown her arms around
Millie.
“I won’t git away,” she snapped.
“Don’t yer see the pore child’s about
ter faint?”
“Anybody’d faint bein’ squz that
erway. Turn her loose. Now, Mil
lie,” he added, when Mrs. Petticord
had released the girl, “tell us who’s
tuck him an’ whut they tuck him
fur.”
“The constable come an’ got him.
They 'cuse him uv stealin’ er hun
nerd dollars from Steve Dye, an’
they’ve tuck him ter ther cross-roads.
Oh, Big Lige, won’t yer please go an’
see whut they’re goin’ ter do with
him?”
Lige arose, without uttering a
Word, and started out. The old man
told him to catch the bay mare and
ride, but he heeded not the sugges
tion.
k “This is a putty kittle uv fish,” the
F giant mused, as he strode along the
road. “I know in reason that he’s
guilty. Pore Millie! She driv her
