A Cotmma IIe View of Law.
Answering the argument used by
the bondholders and their Attorney's
that the State debt of Louisiana is
inviolate because it is in the nature
of a contract, which the .Coastituo
lion of the United States has forbid
. den them to impair, involves the re
k opening of the whole question, but
on more vital grounds. that has,
e since the adoption of the Federal
Constitution, been a source of vioa
lent discussion, and even disastrous
war.
The right to construe the organic
law of our federation by isplication is
a dangerous doctrine. It was de
nounced by Mr. Henry and hbl col
r leagues in the Virginia Conrention,
and so clearly and logically condemn
ed, that had the advocates of its
adoption assumed the right to so
judge that instrument, so construe its
provisions, it would have been a
thing of history, an epoch of human
failure, Instead of the fundamental
law of a great people.
Because the Constitution clearly
prohibit. B tates fbo passing laws
r which will impair contracts it isa a
false and dangerous doctrine to hold
Sthat this, by implication can be dis
torted to cover and effect the sover
eign capacity, the sovereign power of
the State itself, as well as its legisla
tion.
Contracts are lawful agreements,
to do certain things, between legal
bodies or persons : Ergo, personas or
bodies that exist of right by law. A
State has no such existence. It is
sovereign, and a creator of bodies
and persons of law. A Mtate cannot
r he compelled by any legal proess to
observe the stipulations of any obli
r gation; it cannot be sued and seized
upon to compel the performance of
any agreement; hence, the very ar
Sguments now being adduced in sup
port of the monstrous proposition
t that a S.ate debt partakes of the
s nature and Is a contract in a legal
n sense, is absurd.
, To say that because the bonds are
e in the hands of innocent third parties
adds nothing to to e argument. The
same conclusion confronts that pre
I mise-the Slate cannot be compelled
by law to pay. What can be more
absurd than to suppose that form is
essence; yet, on that supposition
lies all foundation for the childish
doetrine now being advanced by the
-agents of the Bondholder. These
gadgrlnds forget the legal require
mients' teesary to constitute asons
Stract, and I tlheir wild worship for
v even the forms of law, have gone so
far arlteo contend that i minor, lwho i.
exemptid by Jaw from being a party
io conracts, Umay "cntract, but that
' contraet, if violated, eaeot be ea.
'forced in law."
If this is not the veriest prever
lion of common .sen, then we are
,I mstaken.

The neeuasity of applying a strin
Sent restraint, at once and forever.
upon the recurrence of such legisla
tion as bas p~rvailed to the extent of
d involving the State in finaneial rain,
is of as great importance to the pew.
ple as the settlement of the aecumo
lated debt whichleh have been the e
suit of prodligrance and extravagance.
If the Constitution reaIets the
power of the legislative braneh of the
government to an authority to pledge
the faith of tLe State for the pays
meat of no bonds, bills, or other
contracts or obligations whatever;
and prohibits it from borrowinl mon
ey for any purpose, except to defray
the expenses of war, or to repel lnva
ldon, the commonwealth will be saved
from ruinous debt, extravagant taxas
lion and certain ruin. If the reve
nueo of the State are not sufficieet to
meet expenses, let the *ixen by vote
appropriate larger means. It will be
necessary on extraordinary occasions
only, to exereise such power, and we
are violently opposed to delegating a
V right, of sueh momentous and vital
n isbortance to the people, to any body
nof men. Money sand foreo are the
I powers most potent to overturn the
- liberties of a itiean. Hence we most
be guarded in our delegation, toother
hands, the un of these dangerous
Slevers.
We submit the following Section
, for the eonsideration of the Conven
l lion.
r Section - The Legislature shall
Sneot have the -power or authority to
s Issue, or to pledge the faith of the
a State as security for the paynment of
r the principle or interest on any bond,
Sbill or other eontract or obligation
whatever; nor to borrow money for
I any purpose whatever, except for deo
f fraying the expenses of war, or for
- the purpose of repelling an invasion
of the State by am armed foree, or of
a suppesing an insarreetlon.
We are unalterably opposed to

We ate as a loss to naderstand
what motive imlpels our esteemed
contemporary, the DeSoto Democrat,
to harp upomn the action of the Ceno
tral Commlittee of this District, in their
action calling a Convention for nom.i
mating Senatorial Delegates. Natchi.
toches bad it in her power to nomi
nate, because she holds the majority of
delegates, and the question of where
the Convention sbould be held is a
matter of very small importance.
We opine our esteemed contempo.
rary will do the Natchitoches people
the credit to admit that they have al
ways yielded a "ready obedience to
the nominees of a Convention, and
attended proaptly the Pleasant Hill
Convention, that has always been
called by no party authority. As to
our Democracy and that of Mr. Cnn
ningham's we think, the iatimation
that it is to be questioned, is too
palpably absurd for comment. If
Natchitoches has not shown by works
her fealty to Democratic principles,
then all we have done and sufered
has been in vain.
We have no quarrel with DeSoto
sad thei correspondence published i
this paper was handed as by gentle
men who have sever yet been sus
picioned even, and they are too old to
now depart from honor'e path.
We, and a large namber of Demo
erats, were in N1ew Orleans at the
time these medings were held, de
fending our conduct as Democrats,
sod hence cannot speak from person
al knowledge. We and they, hower
or, did reeognise the Senatorial tick
et as Democratic, and the nominees
as Democrats, and voted for them for
that reason and none other.
As sueal.
Our dispatehes show that the 8ght
in Congress over measures re lating to
Federal interference in the election
of Congressmen, simply amouts to
the usual Democratic bencoembe.
Nay, we might say, that never since
the disgraceful surrender of the pee
pie's rights through the fraudulent
Electoral Commission; hia such as
eshibition of cowardice been shown.
The priaciple which lies at the
very bottom of this contest-the
right of the Federal authorities to
indict snd punisih citizens for alleged
ie ces committed against soMfage or
sehlagas--is ehamefelly admitted
by these rerenastparty leaders.
The attempt to stisfy public opis.

1 Mr. George W. Dupre, ex-State

was recently indicted by the grand
jury of New Orleans on the chare of

WlWhitaker lust Salturday. and was

turned a verdict of not guilty without
leaving their seats. 'Thus ends one
of the most shameless persecutions
e ever put on fo,ot. The whole schene
a of having Mr. Dupre indicted and
tried in supposed to have originated
with proprietors and managers of the
Times and Picayune, who envied Mr.

to his personal friends and tlhe large

We take this occasion as one of
Mr. Dupre's friends to add our con
gratulations to those of the Tihres to
that gallant gentleman upon his Lion
orable escape from the meshes of as
foul, as damnable a conspiracy as
ever dinraced criminal jurisprudence
in this or any other State.
What most these who' aided and
abetted this infamy now feel over
their discomfiture-we believe some
of them are not yet so dead to shame
as to feel some of the degradation
they richly merit.
