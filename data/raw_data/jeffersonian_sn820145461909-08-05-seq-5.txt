With Our Hats On Our Hearts
Without extenuation of anything
Mr. Morse ever has done there is one
magnificent fact in his admission to
bail.
This magnificent fact is the loyalty
of his wife! He was crushed to
earth. He was jailed as a felon. But
to his splendid wife he remained a
prince—not a felon! Finally she got
her prince out of jail.
No kind of man will fail to applaud
Mrs. Morse. For Mrs. Morse —hur-
rah and three cheers! Nobly done!
May God bless her! We wipe our
eyes.
The wife standing by her husband
to the last tense the pulse of every
human heart. There is one universal,
deep breath of sympathy and respect!
Every mortal man hopes that the
desperate effort of Mrs. Morse in
fighting Fate tooth and nail shall
succeed! Not for the man, but for
the woman. But the thing is not
Fate.
It is only the law of the land. Ac
cording to law a prisoner may be ad
mitted to bail. But that does not
acquit him. Necessarily the law must
be inexorable. No tears of women
can melt the statutes in their fidelity
to the general people.
There must be finality and fidelity
to the general people. And there can
be no appeal save to the United
States Supreme Court.
Meantime all the world loves a
lover and all the world sympathizes
with Mrs. Morse in her struggle to
release her lover and husband from
prison bars.
Every man of us stands with his
hat on his heart in salute to the lady.
But the inherent thing is impersonal
law. The wages of public wrongdo
ing finally is jail.—New York Amer
ican.
There is gush and gush; but the
foregoing is about the mellowest,
softest, most saccharine and mushy
gush that has decorated an editorial
page in some time.
The idea of wifely loyalty is car
ried to an extreme so exaggerated
as to be fairly nauseating. So long
as a woman can persuade herself to
an honest belief in the innocence of
her husband her loyalty presents a
splendid and inspiring spectacle.
But that form of so-called loyalty
which smiles upon the man who de
liberately wrongs her, or wrongs so
ciety, needs a little reformation.
In speaking of the woman accused
of crime, a recent writer said her
sympathies were always enlisted by
the lonely creature in the dock, and
it is quite true. We fail to find the
husband clinging forgivingly to an
erring wife. No, the gentleman
who is humiliated by a wife or other
female relative, generally lets her
shift for herself thereafter. The re
sult is, that by reason of this cer
tain knowledge of desertion the stan
dard of morality among women is
much higher; and we find a very
much smaller proportion of women
getting into the toils of the law. A
demand on the part of women that
their men folk rise to higher stan
dards might rob the world of some
of its poetry perhaps, but substitute
something really better.
When Senator Burton, of Kansas,
went dead wrong, stultifying him
self and bringing shame upon his
State, his wife was much praised for
standing by him. She would have
been bitterly censured no doubt if
Under the Vine and Fig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
she had not done so, and yet, if the
position had been reversed, one very
much doubts if the Senator would
have given up his home and pleas
ures in order to live near the peni
tentiary and carry her meals to her
every day.
When a man runs off with an af
finity he is promptly forgiven so
soon as it is his lordly pleasure to
tire of said affinity and return to the
family he deserted and made wretch
ed. But if a wife finds an affinity she
might as well realize that there will
be no light in the window for her
and, so far as the children are con
cerned, she will be treated as a leper
who may not even touch the babes
she bore.
When You Go Away
Reginald Wright Kauffman
/SOMETIMES think that, when you go away,
Though I am blinded by my love and fear.
So very much are you the world to me
I hat I shall ever, somehow, keep you near.
Though miles dissever and though years divide,
My questing heart shall find you everywhere:
In every night the starlight of your eyes,
In every dawn the sunshine of your hair.
As all things that are beautiful and good
Must ever be a vital part of you,
So all good things and beautiful must hold
Your memory made mercifully true.
For them that love there is not time nor space;
And I shall see, in Love's lore learned and wise,
In every dawn the sunshine of your hair,
In every night the starlight of your eyes.
Why should all society demand of
the weaker sex a deathless loyalty
to male creatures regardless of any
conceivable consideration while it
virtually exempts the stronger from
.exercising the same fidelity? “Till
death do us part” is a vow that
ought to be as binding upon the one
as the other, and yet it is reasonable
to suppose that higher social con
siderations might operate in both
cases (instead of merely the one) to
make it invalid.
Mr. Morse was the man who
brought about a corner in ice,
whereby thousands of wretched lit
tle ones were made to suffer the
pangs of parching thirst through
blistering summer days in the tene
ments of New York. No one who
has watched a sick babe through ex
hausting days and nights as its feeble
life ebbed slowly and surely away,
while one prays and prays for a
breath of reviving coolness, a change
in the heavy, humid, deadly heat—
an hour’s respite that may turn the
tide toward life again; no one who
knows that the only hope is in bring-
3effersonian
ing about as much artificial coolness
as possible, can contemplate without
anguish the idea of feverish babies
moaning for a cold drink and turn
ing fretfully, miserably away from
tepid, disgusting hydrant water. Yet
the Ice Trust caused the thirst-tor
mented infants of the tenements to
die like flies!
And certainly Mr. Morse commit
ted a crime of scarcely less magni
tude against the entire American
people when he helped bring on the
panic of 1907 which wrecked homes
and brought multitudes of honest
men to the verge of suicide or crime.
James Patten, by cornering wheat,
has raised the price of bread, which
means that many a helpless mother
will be driven to despair because
her hungry children cry to her for
food in vain.
Is it a commendable loyalty which
defends such crimes? Or is it not
dangerously akin to that mawkish
sentiment which invariably fills the
cell of some monster with flowers?
Is society in the abstract nothing?
Is a man to prey upon it, certain
that at home he will meet with noth
ing but soft words that tell him he
is the victim of envy and conspiracy?
Isn’t there enough cold, calm intelli
gence abroad in the land to teach
every woman that if her influence is
to have actual weight it must not
only be persuasive, but, on stern oc
casions, repudiative? Are the cries
of suffering to be so mellowed, be
cause they come through marble
walls and thick, rich tapestries that
the woman enshrined within a fine
home can not hear the voice of dis
tress and despair brought about
through ruthless speculation by
which her own husband profits? Is
the very maternal instinct itself to
be no worthier than that which
actuates even a snake to take care
of its own offspring? No man whose
conduct wilfully hurts the helpless
and recklessly disregards the claim
of hungry, thirsty children upon his
chivalry is worthy the pity of any
good woman, much less her love.
Most men would turn in horror
from any woman who directly or re
motely injured a child.
Why should any editor hang his
hat on his heart (a queer peg but al
literation must be conserved at all
hazards), because Mrs. Morse got
some of the uncaught to contribute
to the bond of the caught so that all
might be free to engage in other ne
farious schemes?
Certes he was a felon, and in jail.
He deserved no less. But he wasn't
hungry, he wasn't thirsty, he wasn’t
cold —he wasn’t dying,—he who had
caused so many a fellow creature to
hunger, to thirst, to freeze, to die.
Ideas change slowly, but they DO
Change. Recently a judge was mov
ed, not to tears, but wrath, at the
women who, after being beaten by
their husbands and swearing out
warrants for their arrest, weakened,
forgave and refused to prosecute,
and has warned them that hereafter
they must either take their whip
pings in silence, or be in contempt
of court if they trouble it uselessly.
And, one day, the sense of responsi
bility to humanity may be so de
veloped that the smart gambler and
shrewd speculator may meet with his
deserts, not only abroad, but right at
home. A Goddess of Righteousness
at the Hearthstone would be more
effective than much prosecution, and
far more inspiring than any fancied

SAUCE LORE.
Serve caper sauce with mutton.
Egg sauce with boiled fish.
Cucumber sauce with baked fish.
Cider sauce with boiled ham.
Vinegar sauce with pig’s feet.
Celery sauce with boiled chicken.
Melted butter sauce with filet of
beef and roast chicken.
When cooking mackerel or other

TWO INEXPENSIVE AND DELI
CIOUS DISHES.
Take large, firm green tomatoes,
cut them in slices, dip in meal and
fry brown. They are as fine as egg
plants and taste like fried oysters.
Corn Fritters.
Cut tender corn from cob as if pre
paring to fry, make a batter as if for
batter cakes, pour the corn in and
stir well, fry slowly in plenty of lard
till well browned. This is a delicious
dish for any meal.
Don’t let up on the work because
the weather is hot, or money is
scarce. Keep the subscriptions com
ing.
Providential.

Willie a doctor when there are so
many new doctors every year?”

ailments! ”•—Meggendorfer Blaetter.
