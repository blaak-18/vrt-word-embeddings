DOCTOR HARTXAN.
Ofers Relief to Sick Women for the ,
Asking.
It is at this time of the year when 1,
the weak, nervous woman is most pros- a
trated and least able to perform the t
daily routine of duties which fall to o
her share. She has no ambition, and h.
her work drags upon her at every step. lf
It seems never to be completed, and 1h!
she never feels able to go on with it.
As a rule, she keeps bravely at it, often i
uncomplaining and patient, until she
breaks completely down and can go no b
further. It is to these tired, .listless, i,
unhappy women that Dr. Hartman '
offers advice and encouragement free. h
If all such women will write to Dr.
Hartman, giving a full account of their
troubles, he will answer promptly free ii
of charge and tell them what to take 't
and what to do to make new women i1
of themselves. His advice costs noth- v'
ing, and the medicines are not expen- tl
sive. Every woman who follows his
advice is greatly benefited, and the a
great majority are completely restored tc
to their youthful health and strength.
Every woman may have a copy of
Dr. Hartman's book on female diseases.
It is an invaluable book for the class do
of women to whom it is written. This
book will be sent free to any woman
by The Peruna Drug Manufacturing th
Company, Columbus, Ohio. it
About Dish Washing.
There are a few points about dish
washing which should always be kept ni
in mind. Do not drop knives into hot1 or
water, as it injures the handles and re- I at
moves the cement. Heavy glasscs di
should not be dropped in hot water. e
Thin glasses are less likely to break, w
and almost any glass may be saved se
from breaking if a teaspoon is placed y(
in it before hot water is added. to

COLLECTING RENT.
41-
1 The Old Lady Took Her Kalttin
e and Waited on the Doorstep.
e Commend me to the old lady Is
e Rochester who sought novel and suc
b ecssful means of collecting her house
a rent last week. She was an old l:dy
of Ideas and a knowledge of human
nature gleaned from a lifetime of ex.
perience with the world. She owned
+ a house and lot in Itochester, and the
Income from It was the substance noon
which she depended for life's necessi
ties. It was rather an ostentatious
house and lot ,and the tenants were 4
persons with reputations to sustain, al.
though embarrassed for ready money.
Two months 'rent was due, and the
agent was not able to collect.
The old lady said it was simple
enough. She could collect it herseit. I
Now, she wasn't a stylish or an artistic
old lady; but she was sturdy and im.
perturable, and her proportions were 1
· ample and her spirit unfaltering. She
rang the door bell at an early hour, the
t other morning, and inquired for the;
I head of the family. The servant glow. i
Sered at her and said he was not to be
seen yet for two hours ,because the
family had not yet risen. The early'
on the doorsteps and wait.
Finally she was granted an audience I
r with the tenant, who put her off with
smooth promises. 'I111 just sit here
and wait until you can pay it," replied
the righteous collector, and she settled
herself once more on the doorstep,
took her knitting from her basket and
prepared to spend the day. She nmade
a quaint-looking picture .and all the
neighbors wondered. When anyone
came within conversing distance and
stated rudely at her, she explained, in
a friendly way ,that she was waiting
until the tenants paid their rent. She,
looked truthful, and no one doubted
her, and her plan worked like a charm.'
Thb rent was paid long before sun- '
down ,and she ambled home more than
ever convinced that nothing is impossi
ble.-'Philadelphia Press.
The Disoovery of Quinine.
In a company of prominent lphysi
clans each was asked to write the six
remedies that he would take on board
ship for a voyage around the world, If t
his life were to depend upon the num
ber who would return alive.
The first entry was "opium," unani- t
mously Indorsed. At the second entry I
the vote was a tie between "mercury"
and "quinine," and now that the bi
chloride of mercury has been found to'
be the most efficient of microbe-killers, a
probably that would have second place c
unanimously ,and the third would be I
unhesitatingly given to the various ex-'
tracts of the bark of the several vari
etles of the chichona, of which the
most familiar is quinine, a name de
rived from that used by the Peruvian
Indians ,who called the trees kina. t
The old-fashioned method of adimin
istering was by macerating the "quills" I
of bark In wine, and the great tonic in I
the early part of the century was
"bark and wine," and as In these latter
days it has been demonstrated to be di
rectly fatal to the bacillus malaria, we
can easily understand what a boon it t
was to the settlers in the underdrained
and "fever-and-ague' 'regiona of this t
country when new. At last, by the c
advance of chemical skill ,the secret of t
extracting its alkaloids was found, and
of these no less than thirteen are
known and used, and some of them J
produce a valuable medicine at a less s
cost than quinine itself.
In 1854 the Dutch government un- a
dertook to raise the trees in the Island s
of Java, and now they have most pros- o
perous plantations; but the most ex- '
tensive and successful of what may be
called Intelligently-cotzducted planta
tlons are in British Burmah. In
Iouth Africa the bark is obtained by t
first stripping the trunk, then felling a
the tree, but under English botanists S
in India a way is found of partially a
stripping the trunk and then su.-round
lag it with moss, causing fresh bark to
be produced. The botanists have ever
foad a way of making the bark fuller a
of the desirable alkaloids.-New York

HIEALTH IN OLD AGE,
AN OLD WOMAN FINDS THE
TRUE SOURCB OF VITALITY.
A Iteporter's Intereestng lIterview With
a Lady of seventy-two Years, Who Telli
a Marr.eous Story.
Fromn tr.e Union, Port Jervis. N. Y.
Ll But a short time ago, in a distant
part of the country, we heard of a
cure by the use of Dr. Williams' Pink
n Pills, which seemed almost marvelous.
- and more recently another substantial
a evidence of their value reached our
e ears. Being of an inquiring turn of
. mind, and wishing to know Just how
much there was in the story, a reportlr
was sent to interview the person slid
to be thus benefited. If the narrative
as it had reached our ears was true.
it was only simple justice to let it be
known-if It proved untrue. It would be
well to know It.
The person alluded to above as having
e been thus greatly benefited by the use
e'of Pink Pills is Mrs. Jane liotal n. of
Hainesville. N. J.. a pleasant hamlet in
Sussex County, about fifteen miles from,
this office. The reporter had no d!tfl
culty in finding Mrs. Hotalen. She Is a
pleasant-faced old lady, looking to be
sixty-five, but Ia in reality seventy-two
years of age. After a few preliminary
t remarks in explanation of the 'all ph,,
was asked if she had any objection to
giving us tihe details of the case and
how she came to try this now famous
remedy.
"Not at all," said she. "If my expe
rience can be of any good to oth"rs, I
i am sure they are welcome to it-it can
do me no harm."
"When were you taken sick and what
was the nature of the malady?"
"It was about two years ago. The
trouble was rheumatic In character
sclatica. they called it-and it was very
painful Indeed. The difficulty began In
my hip and extended the whole length
of the limb, crippling me completely.
I suffered intensely from it, and the or
dinary treatment gave me not the
slightest alleviation. I was under treat
ment about a month as stated, but grow
worse instead of better, and was fast be
coming discouraged."
"What brought Pink Pills to your
notice?"
"My son called my attention to an
article In a paper, In which it was stated
that a Mr. Struble, of Branchville, a
'illage in this county, had been greatly
benefited by their use, and suggested
that it would be a good plan to try
them. But I was skeptical In regard
to their value-in fact, I had no con
fldence in their efficacy, and rather
laughed at the suggestion. But the
trouble increased and I was badly crip
pled. A few days later my son was
about to visit a neighboring town and
suggested again that it might be well
to try this much-talked-of remedy, and
I then consented. He bought me a box
of them, and I began taking them at
once. At the end of a week I noted a
marked improvement, and by the time
I had taken the first box I was able to
I walk without a cane. I continued their
use, taking several boxes, and am. as
you see, in a very comfortable state of
health."
"Have you had any return of the
trouble?"
"Not as yet, though at my time of
life, seventy-two, It would not be sur
prising if I should have. If it comes I
should at once begin the use of the pills.
I suppose I Inherit a tendency to
troubles of this kind-my mother died
from them."
"Did you ever note any 11 effects from
the use of Pink Pills?"
"None whatever. They never dis
turbed my stomach in any way or
caused me any annoyance. I am able,
as you see, to attend to my own work.
The reporter thanked Mrs. Hotalen
for her courtesy and bade lhr good
day. It is not often that one can wit
ness such a complete recovery from
such a pertinacious trouble at such an
advanced age, and such instances can
not fall to produce a profound impres
sion. Readers of the Union may rely
on the absolute accuracy of all the
statements here given - nothing has
been exaggerated, nothing withheld.
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills contain, in
a condensed form, all the elements nec
essary to give new life and richness
to the blood and restore shattered
nerves. Pink Pills are sold by all deal
ers, or will be sent postpaid on receipt
of price, by addressing Dr. Williams'
