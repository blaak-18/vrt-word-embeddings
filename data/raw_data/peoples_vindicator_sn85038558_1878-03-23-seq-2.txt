Ideal or Real.
"Party governlment, says Nordhiol,
"is necessary in a free State.
"The organizatiol of political par
"ties is the only meats hy which the
"sense of the people can be got at
"elections upo'n questions of piubli.e
"policy; and by party govern1(1ments
"only can responsibiility he fixed on
"political leaders, so that these may
"receive approval or olndemnllation.l
"A non-partisan govecrnlmelnt is the
"dream of weak and am1iable lln;
"it belongs to an ideal condition, Ilt
"which all men shall e unselfiish,
"and sincerely desirous of the public
"good. In the present condition of
"mankind, a non-partisan govern
"ment- one in which Iboth or all par
"ty leaders shoull shaCe-'wold he,
"and has been where ever trel(d. only
"an admirable and effective ldevice
"to conceal corruption, because it
"becomes then the interest of thle
"leaders of both parties to crvover up
"wrong, both having their share ot
"public plunder.
These are the calm and studied uit
terances of a student of political his
tory who has few superiors in Anmeri
ca. It seems he had a prophetic eve
to what was to befall us in Louisiana,
after we had been ravaged by a horde
that carried partizanshiip to an ex
treme.
The calm observer can trace out
the insidious tutor that planted this
Conservative idea among ns. It is
traced directly back to Radicalism:
for they were always willing to share
plunder with any body of men-any
man of influence-who would cease
to resist their faith or condemn their
works.
New York in her days of "Ring
Rule," was fed upon Conservatism to
satiation by Tweed's Ring-its ve'ry
arm of plunderers, and that city fail
ed to correct the evils complained of
until it was done with a strong party
effort.
To-day in our State the most bla
tant advocates of Conservatism are
our former tyrants-they get their
cue from Blaine, Foster, Garfield and
Hoar, who smilingly insist that the
"best element in Louisiana are op
"posed to opening old wounds; are
"not in accord with the punishment
"of Wells and Anderson, and their
"very hearts bleed for some Radical
"thief who has at last been brought
"to justice.
We warn our fellow-citizens of
these sentiments. They are alike
dangerous to our institutions and
fatal to our interests. We have had
a full year of ideal government, and
the result is in plain view.
We have reached that era described
by M. DE TOCQUEVILLE-the epoch
between misery and confusion, when
the existance of society is endanger. I
ed-the period of the ease of society
and when mankind seems to pause.
This great writer anid close observer
says:
"This pause is, indeed, only ap- r
"parent; for time does not stop its c
"course for nations any more than I
"for men ; they are all advancing to
"wards a goal with which they are t
"ounacquainted; and we only imag-r
"ihe them to be stationary when their I
'!progress escapes our observation. *
" * * But however this may
"be, there are certain epochs at which
"the changes that take place in thle
"social and political Constitution of h
"nations are so slow and so insensi
"ble, that men imagine their present b
"condition to be a final state; and
"the human mind, believing itself F
"to be firmly based upon certain tl
"foundations, does not extend its a
"researches beyond the horizon
"which it descries.
"l'hese are tlhe times of small par.
"ties and of intriguee!
Had this astute gentleman lived at
this day, he could not have better C
told our situation. We abandoned I
the only element of greatness Ithat
party can claim; PRINCIPLE. We F
looked to consequences; to an espe- P
cial case, and not to general; to
men and not to ideas. And when we
abandoned that high plane we snnk a
to duplicity, trickery, and cowardice. l
Real parties are distinguished, and
have been since thle dawn of human
government, for generous passions,
genuine convictions, and for bold and
open conducnet. If there be private
interests, it is so veiled under the
idea of publio good, that the very
person whom private gain may ex
cite and impel, does not perceive it.
On the other hand, small parties-
parties of intrigue-are totally de
ficient in faith. They have no digni
ied or lofty purpose to sustain their
actions, and in them are displayed I
the very selfishness and egotism of i
their character.
"They glow with factitions zeal;
"their language is vehement, but
"their conduct is timid and irresolute.
"The means they employ are as C
-"wretehed as the end at which they
"aim. HenSe it arises that when a
"calm state of things succeeds a vio
"lest rsevolation, the tleaders of soeie.
"y seem nsuddenly to disappear, and
S"the pois o. f tho hI lian lliid lie'i
"* 'collncenled.
.oiet!I is c ra.ºrler bly qreat parlies
those mi1r OnF l.(. thii.e of intrigue
eS that taction wh lich tnow prevails ii
this State-only agitate. Utieat par
r. tics rend society, wiiio11 ones degrade
it.
lHetl is stulnmed tilu the causes of ouii
political Iiost tation ; the reasons lot
our ,. senlt di.t'ontent. The remiedy
is as palpable as the disease. \%e

i It nmatlters not if we fail of the ae

Whether the charge that the : ene
ral Assemnbly has wa;sted the greateil
it part of the session, be tItle or not, it
is has donIe a great deal il' w'oik in tihe
is te days past while I have 1.een a
spectater of its deliberations. Ever\
'ncimbert has a number of ills whits. wiclh,
we ithout a public interest. are
y of importance to his itinmediate con
se tittients. These are i,,ist genraill\
ir passed without opposition, and thus.
ait great deal of work is got thronugl
with without makinkg any noise ,1
attracting much attention. Ifence it
o is that these charges of wasting the
people's money and time are moust
S generally recklessly mnade. Antl es
Ipeciailly do I deem it im politic and
f ill-advised (ion the part of tihe Conser
vative press and Conservative voters
F to deal in wholeshale deniunciations
of the first Conservative Legislature
we have had since the dawn of tile
e reconstruction 'era. Old Shad Penn,
r the Kentucky Denocratic editor, nse:l
to say that a Democratic editor
should never denounce his own party
e leaders for the reason that the oppo
sition is ready to take such a job oil
his hands at any tmoment it may be
come necessary. Our present Legis
lature has been surrounded by many
r difficulties. That it deserves well o
the public, and that it has done well,
under the circumstances, I am con
vinced after an attentive observation
of its workings.
At once upon the adjouranment
conies the same old excuses. Here
we have a string of specious and
special pleading which are, to put it
mildly, conteruptable.
Private bills in the interest of "irm
mediate constituents," forsooth
While the general public is suffering
untold evils from Radical legislation,
left rankling in our wounds, the leg
islature is using the people's mnioney
to further "individnal iitetrests." W,
have had entirely too much of this
private legislation, embraced gene.
rally in chartering Fire Companies,
changing mens' names and fixin
loop-holes in the Civil Code for dis
honest men to creep throughll, while
the general public is left to groan
undem the ills and evils of ten years
Radical legislation.
"Our present legislature has been
surrounded by many difficulties!'!"
and pray what are tlhose difficulties?
They had a working majority in both
houses, a Governor to sign the bill
and a large majo(rity of citizens to
back them up-then why did they
not apply the knife. "Old Shad
Penn" won't do even, at this time,
to cover thle many and glaring sin
of the first, and we hope the last,
"Conservative" legislature.
A questionable Compliment.
We want to see our firiend Jas. LI.
Cosgrove, of the Vindicntor, in the nextt
legislature. We inliagine that with a'
few determined men like him in that'
hbtly, from North Louisiana. to aid thet
Florida parishes, reform could Ie accom
plished with hut little trouble.-Baton
Rouge Advocate.
Friend Annis, we ate not of snech
as aspire to official greatness. We ~
thank you kindly for your wish; but,
we'd rather be Editor of the VIn- Ii
CATOR than be Governor of the State. a
This may be egotism, and it may beh
like the little boy Jack that didn' t
want supper-because lie couldn't
get it, but it's true, nevertheless.
That Extra Session.
Fifteen days more !
And Beecher dares to say there's
no hell!
Its here ; its here.
