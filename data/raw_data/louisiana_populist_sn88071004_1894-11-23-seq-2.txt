NOTICE TO ADVERTISER-.
All defendants in judicial sales
have the right to select the paper
in which the advertisement is to be
inserted, therefore we would ask
sar friends to rive us a hid before
advertising. The Populist is be
ing run in the interest of humani
ty, and it is the duty of all men to
support it. Also those who enter
homesteads have a right to select
their own paper for advertising.
Don't fail to give us a call and we
will treat you well.
WHY DODGE THE QUESTION.
We find it somewhat strange
that men and especially those who
pretend to be friends to the people
are endeavoring to dodge the main
issues in the discuions of the
questionpft ard times,- tJt is the
case. We hear men who are forced
to admit that the country is in a
deplorable condition, and that the
chances for the masses of the peo
ple to suffer in the near future are
extremely great and yet you find
tte Democratic press and would
be Democratic leaders giving var
ious excuemm and syggesting var
ious remedies. Of course there
are some who have laid down their
prejudices and investigated for
themselves, and this class seem to
realise the seriousness of the mat
ter and areat least wiling to give
the masses of the people credit for
being right. These, however, we
are sorry to msay are very few.
The majority are always ready to
iome forward with their old worn
out theory of "laimess," "over
production," "lack of comdMmee,"
",ound money" and other delusive
absurdities, intead of comiing
down to an invmestigatiom a the
real conditiom that have existed
inthis as well - all othe coun

We do not hrve t examin very

But enforced soeaomy (i it irues
i that digaity) has always de

population a decrease of consump
tion of 35,KQOQ.,0N pounds of bread
a week, or 144I.0kP0,0$tM pounds a1
month. This would be just one
item in which the consumption of
wheat would be shortened; but
there are many other ways, one of
which is the use of stuarch, and an
other in the consumption of paste,
both of which would be nmaterially
decreased in a bad time.
In the consumption of cotton the
effect of the hard times is as plain
ly seen. If each one of the 70,
t Ni,4N N people of the United States
should be forced to economize, on
account of the hard times, to the
extent of one cotton garment a
year, and each garment should re
quire three yards of cotton goods,
there would be a decrease in cot
ton fabrics used to the extent of
210,tMn),tMO) yards. The enforced
economy has been much larger
than is assumed in the figures
presented, and it is plain that,
if times had been good in the
United States in the past two years,
the large crops of cotton and wheat
would not have kept down prices
as they did. They would have
been more nearly ulsed up than
they were.
IJt is evident from any careful
consideration of the facts that the
country has suffered vastly more
from the bursting of the enor
mous speculative bubbles of 1893
than it has from excessive crops of
wheat and cotton, or from any
other cause.
Had our esteemed contemporary
followed up his theory, he could
and wonld have showed that the
manufacturer can not buy cotton
at a good price and manufacture it
into goods when he can not find a
market for his products, and that
the same manufacturer would buy
cotton at any price, it matters not
how high it is if he had a brisk
sale for his products. He does not
care what he pays for cotton if he
can sell his products, as he is al
ways sure to make it back in their
price. What he wants is a sale of
his products, for it makes business
for him and business makes him
money, therefore the business is
what he wants and there is no one
(we suppose) who is silly enough
to say that the manufacture of cot
ton goods esa buy cotton at as
price at ali make it up into the
products of his mill and let them
lay on his shelves, that is not busi
ness and therefore he can not do it
any more than the merchant can
buy the goods and let them remain
on his shelves. This is not busi
ness either and you can not find a
merchant that will be able to do so
very long, for it is only a question
of time when he must go to the
wall. . Neither can the farmer make
cotton and house it up and let it
remain. He makes it to sell the
same as the manufacturer makes
his products for sale, and if either
of them fail to sell they have no
use for them.
Now if the slight enforced econ
omy spoken of by the Plesyne pro
duces aIch t lts, both in
wheat and in cotton, T us follow
the same course of reasoning but
in reverse order. Suppose there
was suffcient money in cireulation
to do the business of the country,
we do not think it unreamsonable to
may that each of the population of
the United 8tates would cooume
at least Lie dollars worth of cot
ton goods, in fact could buy it now
and neot be at all extravagant. Of
eourse this would include sheets,
towels and other cotton cloth us
ally comumed for the household
aes, therefore we do not think we
have over-eetlated the amoaunt,
but in many instanmes under-esti
mated it. Now fve lollars per
ealit woould give the seveeaty mil
lion of people $80,000,000 and
with attos at SO per bale would
fore the demand for seventeen
million ve hundred thousand
bales of eaottoe at the present
pries. Itisnot nmeemry totell
Silnteligeat m that tbi, would
not earryth pie of eaeon up.
Now it we aeorremt we me that

ea el et be evam money in

slmh ie emams r sawtt b ·
a^L kaersein somer is not
business for anybody but the tnon
ey lender. The bank note is the
individual money of the hanker,
and never goes into circulation ex
cept as a loan for interest therefore
it is not a money, but a device in
the hands of a few men to absorb
the labor of the common masses
by drawing interest and only makes
business for the banker and not for
the masses. The banks of issue
only loan money for ninety days,
and as the farmer only realizes
from his crops once a year it is im
possible for this class of money (or
device) to go into the cultivation
and gathering of a crop, hence the
farmer must deal on a credit at
whatever exhorhitant rates of
profit the merchant chooses to
charge him. We do not mean by
this to cast any reflection upon the
honest merchant, for he too de
pends upon the produce of the farm
and when the produce of the far
mer fails to pay his account, the
merchant is usually forced to lose
the Ibalance as the farmer has no
money to pay it, no matter how
honest he may he.
We say in conclusion that we
hope the intelligent people of this
country will seriously consider
these issues and do so without any
prejudice, as these are the issues
to be met sooner or later, and it
matters not how hard we strive to
put them off, and the' further we
put them from us the harder they
are going to be to solve.
Nice Kettle of Fish.
We see from several papers that
Murphy J. Foster is a eandidate
for re-election, and it is authorita
tively stated that John Fitzpat
rick is supporting him. Fitzpat
rick says : "The Governor is a good
Democrat and a good man, and
therefore he will support him." It
is said upon the other hand, that
Foster has said that he will do all
in his power to have Callahan and
other boodle eouncilmen pardoned.
If all be true of Murphy J. Foster
that the. Deumoerat tlheraelves
have saki of him relative to stuf
Lng ballot boxes in Bt. >sry ppr
ish, be, to-day, would be -ebind

instead be is enjoying the fruits of
ballot box staufing, and edntempla
ting a continuation of the sane by
a. union with those whom the lead
ing papers are denouncing as the
most incarnate fiends outside of
the penitentiary. We do not wish
to detract anything from the plu
mage of these gentlemen, but when
we come to consider the welfare of
the whole people, we find the pros
pects of reform surrounded by the
deepest gloom. We now under
stand what his excellency meant
when he openly declared at Bun
ton, "that the party machinery
wouhl be used to ierpetuate the
Democratic party." We clearly
see what the Governor means when
be uses the terms "Demccratic
party." We only have to rn our
memory back a few years to see
exactly the maine state of facts that
now exist, but in those days we
called it earpetbagism, scoundrel
iam and robbery, but then it was
the Bepublicans, now it is the
Democrats, (so-called), who are
dlomineering the same class of
people by the same heinous onut
rageous system of pollutions and
ballot box etnmnmg that prevailed
then. Are the people in a better
condition to day to labor at it than
they were then We say emphat
ically no. Every _true Loualianian
points with pride to the green spots
that marks the graves of tbose
whose blood was spilt to wipe out
what we called the darkest days
of Loulisiaus. The acenes of Corn
bshatt, Colfax, New Orleans, and
even the historic city of old Nat~b
itoebes amre too fresh in the minds
of the people for them to silently
submit to these infamous fheads,
whichb if they are not stopped will
easues this same history to repesat
itself.

Some of the Results,
The election for Congressman in
the Fourth District gives results
thiat should encourage every Popu
list in it, andl put to Ilush every
Democrat.
In the seven parishes in which a
fair (legal) election was had, i. e.
both parties allowed commissioners
at each poll, Mr. Bailey beat Mr.
Ogden 9274 votes. But in the oth
er five, Mr. Bailey's majorities were
converted (as in Red River) into
unwarranted majorities for Mr.
Ogden.
The grossest of frauds were per
petrated in these parishles and will
be shlowli up in dlue time, and it
will be shown to the satisfaction
of every one, except the ballot box
thieves themselves, that Mr. Bailey
was fairly and legally elected. All
selfrespecting and conscientious
Democrats know this now and
many of them admit it.
The only hope of the scoundrels
who have perpetrated these frauds
inn the name of Democracy and to
the injury of the better element of
Democrata is that the Populists
will not be able to raise the money
absolutely required to contest, and
that their wretched crimes will
thus be allowed to remain half
hidden from the frown of public
condemnation.
Our campaign has been one of
sacrifice, and it will be anothler and
greater to make this contest, but
duty calls where only patriotism
can follow, and the heroes who
have rolled up an honest majority
of the votes of this district are
able and willing to bear the bur
den of testing every known re
souree of law and order to secure
their rights. Failing by such meth
ods, thley are ready and anxious to
use thobe means which they (the
same people) used in support of
the I)nmocratic party when it was
dominated by the same powers
which it is to-day using against
its opiponenta.
We dread war, riots or time shed
(ling of blood, but the AIglo-axon
will never be dominated by an
other race, however real, to say
nothing of an imaginary one, and
coAis in store for the ballot thieves
in the next election. They ought
to, and doubtless will be shot down
like dogs.
The Pullman Palace Car Com

of $2 per share. Only a few
months since the eme concern al
leged that their shops were being
operated at a loss, which necessi
tated the reduction of the wages of
their employes to almost a starv
ing basis. The employes at Pull
man appealed in vain for wages
which would enable them to pro
vide the necesearies for their famuni
lies, andm when they struck for
higer wages, Pullman found the
strong arm of the government to
proect him. If the shops were
operated at a lois, how can the
companay declare a dividend of $9
per share except by a syteantic

LULA, LA., Nov. 17th, 194.
EDITOR LOUISIANA POI'CLIT:
)Dear Sir:-The clketion has
conme and gone. ()ne hundlred and
eighteen years ago religious and
)politinal liberty was declared. In
the fifty-third congress, nmenmers
of the lower house votAl in direct
violation of their oath to suplport
the constitution in suplport of ap
p)ropriation bills which w'ent to'
build up sectarian schools, our
member from the 4th, included in
the number. Is not this a direct
blow at religious liberty, antd yet
our great and goodl pious people
who are so consistent, and so much
interested about the salvation of
the poor benighted heathen, could
go to the polls, carrying with them
their influence, and vote for a man
who was thus voting away their
(gxl given liberty, their blood
bought liberty, and a man who
would wallow in the mire as it
were, with the lowest scums of the
earth, who would stoop to anything
in politics, it matters not how low,
just simply because the party of
their forefathers had nominated
him, not realizing that the party
had long since departed from the
principles of its founders; while
on the other hand, a man advoca
ting the principals of Jefferson,
Jackson, Calhoun and other states
men who have gone to their record;
a man known to be competent in
every sense of the word, to retre
sent the whole people irrespective
of political or religious creeds; a
man known to be a christian gen
tlemen, and temperate in all things,
could not get their support. Oh!
consistency, thou art a jewel. Our
political liberty bought by the
great common people with blood,
God being on their side, has almost
been stolen from us. The party in
power resorts to anything to defeat
justice and freedom, in casting and
counting the ballot. The election
just past, in DeSoto, cannot be
beaten for fraud, intimidation and
bribery. In the first place, the
supervisors failed to comply with
the election law in selecting com
missioners. Some precincts had
only one commissioner, one had
more than one, and some had none.
They cannot plead ignorance, be
cause the Chairman of the People's
party executive committee, with
the assistance of another gentleman,
recommended two or more for each
polling place in the parish save
one, to represent the People's par
ty. At Lula, one of the clerks
who was a Democrat, was very ac
tive in offering Ogden tickets to
the voters as they came in, trying
to, or rather dictating what ticket
they should vote. At Mansfield,
they bribed the negroes by giving
them a barbecue on election day,
having drawn the negroes out from
the different wards with their
meata, they then forced them
algainet their will to vote for Og
(len. Business men heretofore
commanding the greatest respect
from the people, and men who was
supposed to be christian gentlemen
marched negroes up to the polls
from other wards, their names not
beingon the poll book of ward 4,
and made them vote for Ogden
against their will. A gentleman
who had the People's party tickets
for Mansfield, placed them on the
table where they were voting, three
ditfferent times, and they were des
troyed each time in less than lif
teen minutes; two boxes in ward 5
had no tickets; suppose they were
destroyed also.
At Pelican, so far as election
day is concerned, every thing is re
ported quiet. But previous to the
election, tot several days, leading
Democrats rode over the country
ntelling the negroes that if they vo
ted for Bailey it would not be safe
for them to sleep in their houses;
also that it might not be safe for
them anyway if they did not go
and vote for Ugden. Negroes who
voted tha People's party ticket
have been cursed and abused by
business men of Mansleld. I ask
in the name of God, and for the
go of the downtroddea, safering
humanity, has a man not the right
to voteas his eomaeiemee dictates.
If the negro is not euttled to vete
ashee plees, then take away his
ofrapchie legally,. ad do not steal
them directly or indirectly. I do
not believe its right to lead an: I
norant man, be he white or 1 ,ick,
to the polls ;land ftirce' hill to vole,
anad the I1an1 who tin te- anlother to
vote :agalinst his will. \vill som1e tday
pay the penialty in tlihe lower re.
gious. We ha;ve this consolation
left 1us, that the ellne who readl anll
think for theimselves ; the men whl,
are intelligently keeping piee with
the times, 'atching and \orLing
for tihe greatest gox1l to tine great
est InmIIber; the men who believe
in every man having an equal
chance ill the race of life to accl
iulante wealth, are the menll who
voted for B. W. iBailey.

The Only Party Whioh Made
Gains.
Perhaps after some of our es
teemed eontenII1rari.es have iluitt,
finished talking alcbt "theI decline
of Populism," "the busting of the
Populist bubble," and the like, they
may have tinme to note that the
People's Imrty was the one party
in the late elections which east a
larger vote than it polled in the
United States in 18192. Nearly 2,
EMNO,(Nt) Populist votes were count
ed this year, while in 19192, with
the stimulus of a Presidential elec
tion, only 1,041,028 were east.
D)emocratic leaders and journals
that ignore these significant fig
ures are guilty of the most stwpen
dous folly. There cannot be 2,
m)0,NtI Populist votes cast in lsefº
and aDI)emocratic president elect
ed, for Populism's later gains have

Having seen in the Times-I)emo
crat and other papers that Hon. A.
Benoit, People's party candidate
for Congress from the Fifth Con
gressional District of Louisiana
would contest Hon. C. J. Boatner's
seat, we sought Mr. Benoit and
asked him for the facts in the case.
lie informed us that he had served
notice on Mr. Boatner that he
would contest his election .on the
grounds of wholesale fraud and
intimidation east of the Ouachita
river, and had also written to the
Governor and Secretary of State
protesting against the issuance of a
certificate to his competitor on the
grounds above stated. Mr. Benoit
informed us that. he contends that
the apparent majority obtained for
Boatner in the parishes of East
Carroll, Madison, Tensas and Con
cordia, amounts to 8000 but that
this represents merely ballot box
stuffing in those parishes where the
total vote did not exceed one-tenth
of the returns. He stated further
that he contends that in other par
ishes east of the river there was
wholesale bulldozing of the neg
roes before and at the election and
that he will be able to show that be
was elected by fully 2000 majority
of the honest vote actually cast.
He says he intends to press the
matter to a final and complete in
vestigation and, if possible, expose
all frauds committed in the inter
est of true ballot reform.-Mon

ATLArNTA, Ga., Nov. 20.-Tom

from the Tenth Georgia District
has aeoepted representative J. G.
C. Black's offer to settle the con
troversy whether the Populist or
the Democrat was elected on No
vember 6th last, by trying the
thing over again. Blaek on the
face of the returns had over a
thousand majority, but the same
counties in the election for gover
nor gave a decided majority for
the Popilist candidate.
The following dispatch, clipped
from the Times-Democrat, needs
no comment. It speaks for itself:
