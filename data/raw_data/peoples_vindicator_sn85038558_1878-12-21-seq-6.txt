MUSTER ROLL. V
The following is the muster roll of tihe
company of volunteers who marched to
New Orleans, in 1815, to join. enoral
Jackeson in the defence of that city. The
company did not, we believe, arrive in
time to participate in the glorious
aohievements of the 8th of January. It
is well to preserve a record of the names
of those who then were impelled by pa
triotism to shoulder the musket to repel
the invaders

in their political status, has, with us,
not been attended with no violent demon- st

C
in of The inadeqnacry of this lttar, for CAullnt

oarae all of which nre board of directors, com
vould 1 posed of citizens of the respective his
would tricts, to whom are confided the man
0sec agement and control of their schools,
tainti- selection of teachers, &c.; and the fund
1w Or- is distributed to these districts in
ld en- amounts coriesponding with the nuto
with ber of educable' children in each district.
. No As we stated before, the fund is suffi
tok of ciently large, raised as it is by a general
ast otax throughout the State and in the
a the wards, to compensate good telhers,
hicl biild comfortable school houses, ancat

valuable land can be entered at much
lower prices than in the northwest.
We have thus, as concisely as possi
ble, endeavored to portray the advan- 0O
tages and inducements which our parish 0
offers for the immigration of substantial
people who desire good homes and for
tile lands on cheap and favorable terms.
In inviting immigrants to our midst, we j
are actuated by no intention or desire to D
speculate upon them, or to dispose of
lands in the interest either of the
pa;ish or land owners for purposes of in- J
divilual speculation or gain. We know A
that the development of the resources of G
our parish, by means .ofthe cultivation
h oflandp 'ow idle for want of labor, and
t by rndering available all the other ad
vantages to which we have referred, will V
promote, not only the interest and j
wealth of the iummigrant and settler, but, V
h that :general prosperity, comfort and
0 wealth, will follow as surely as does the I
day and thd night. We therefore cor- -
y dially inite honest :and industrious im
d migrants to come among us, and we con- j
fidently assure them that every represek
re tatiou which we have made will be fully
'veriied,.and that our authorities and our
people will extend to them a hearty wel.
, come, and render them every. facility in
their new. homes, which they pdses or I
can conmmand. . -

We have the honor to submit for u
sideration the above report. It wi, ho
be seen that the report embraces ors two
nd months of the year 1877, the $ason of
which is our inability to obtain from the
laI formher School Board of the parish the
or repOrts of teachers for the year 1l870,
ud henoo re"hWehareny repoPted the opera
tions of the various schools since our in
duction in office, and we have no data
1 by which we can be guided in rueortiug
he the overatious for the schools for the
lo- year 1870, although our best endeavors
the have been made toward that end. Our
id schools now reported are all of primary
grade. WM. A. PONwR,
