Testimony of E. L. Pierson.
Before the Congressinal Committee.
Question.- By Mr. Fields.-- State
where you reside I
Answer.-I was born and raised in
Natchitoches; and reside in Natchito
ches, in the northern portion of the
State.
Q. What is your profession I
A. I am a lawyer, sir.
Q. You were born there, in Nat
chitoches ?
A. Yes, my father practiced law
there for forty years.
Q. State to the committee, wheth
er or not, you are well acquainted
with the condition and the situation
ot the parish for the last twelve
months ?
A. Yes.
Q. As to peace, ,good order and
quiet ?
A, Yes, I am tolerably well ac
quainted with the Parish of Natchi
N. toches; I have been all over it, and
I know most of the people. From
June last, up to the election and ever
since the election and up to date,
there has been a spirit of violence, in
timidation and even attempted as
sassination in that parish.
° Q. Go on and give the history of it ?
A. Well, sir, I can only state, as
far as. ielf is concerned. From 1868
up to I was a Democrat and held
impor r.t positions in that parish;
I acted on the executive committee ;
d was chairman of one; I think ini
the year 1870; I was elected Mayor
`n of the city of Natchitoches by the De
mocrats in 1870 and up to 1871; I
was the Democratic candidate for the
Legislature in 1872. In 1874, on the
R. 4th of July, I joined the Republican
party. Previous to my joinining the
Republican party, my social position
was as good as ally gentleman in the
city of Natchitoches; my father [hav
ing been an old resident and the law
partner of Wmin. M. Levy, now elected
to Congress; and I was afterwards as- I
sociated with Col. Levy. After I be- I
came identified with the Republican I
party on the 4th of July, I was sub
t, jected to ostradrsm; I was scorned at a
upon the streets, and was declared by I
resolution of their committee, the
Democratic and Conservative party,
to be a public enemy, because I join
I. ed the Republican party. I came I
down here in August last, after the
forced resignation of the tax collector,
district judge, and I think, district at- I
torney; and Governor Kellogg ap
pointed me parish Judge ofthat par- 1
ish. I returned on the 27th of Aug., 1
expecting to perform the functions of I
my office. When I got "within six
teen miles of Natchitoches, I met a
friend of mine, a Dem'ocrat, who told
me there was a good deal of excite
ment in Natchitoches. I asked hiim1
why I lie said : "They understand
you have been appointed parish judge
and they swear you should'nt serve."
I asked: "What is the objection ? I
He said he did'nt know. I said: "I
- will try any how I" I arrived iiltown I
at night; and the morning after I
met Col. Burke, C. Chaplin, and sev
eral others. They told me, under no
condition must I attempt to hold
court, or exercise the functions of my
office. Said I, "why, what is the
reason I" They said : "Well, we think
your life is in danger." I said : "But
g gentlemen, thlat is strange." Have
I done anything dishonorable or am
oI incompe~tentt They said: "No",
ir I asked againand they said: "Well,
they won't let you hold court because
you are a Republican and got Kel
I logg's commission." "Well", said I,
11 "I will try it anyhow." So on the
e 1st of September, thIe day on which
me court was to be opened, forty armed
men came in the city of Natchitoches.
I was at my office. My wife sent me
a note by my brother, telhlng me to
come home immedietely. Iremarked
to my brother, that I did no want to
. go ;that I was going to hold courtk
A few minute8 after that, she came
down crying and begging me to go
Shome. I told her, no ; that I would
d not be bullied by these White Leag
ners; that Ihad done nothing wrong.
She insisted upon my going; and
when I went home my sister told me
' I that she had heard two of these arm
ed men say that they had come in
town for the purpaose of killing me.
Their expression was thlat they would
be damned if I should sit as judge of
that,parish. I then went to Col.
Iaurke dnd said: "It is impossible for
me to compete with the whole parish,
I I am alone and don't want to saeritfee
my life. I would act npon, our, sag.
gwstion, and would not hold court."
Jast after that, I met Col. Pierson, of
the firm of Jack & Pierson, who was
always a friend of mine. and says I,
"what is tihe objection here to me "
"'Well," he said, don't you know I It
is impossible for me tell you the real
reason. You kfow as well as I do
a, that these pebple are not going to al
low any one who holds Kellogg's
l commission to sit as Judge, and i
would advise you not to attempt it."
I did not attempt it. On another day,
Id while Iwas at home, the Committee
b- I of Seventy up there held a meeting.
They appointed a committee to wait
ie upon me. That committee called
upon me while I was dining. - After
- I tgetup and went to the parlor, I
said;: ,What is it gentlemen f" They
said: "We have called upon youn,
having been appointed by a mass
.eeting to demand of you a written
agreement." Said I: "Of what f"
iThey said: To the effect that you
will take no part in the coming cam
Ipaigd." SaidI: Do yeon want to ex
re elude me fron votiug.? They said:
oYes." Do yo~d want to deprive me
of my right' as sah A~Lrcan eaitfane.
The.y id:;-t'Yea". ,aid: "I efaseo
!to aignsu eh a agreement;I rog
._ aim" thie r igh' I"amive' tb vii;': as I
en please." Oaofthe geditlemen pulled
le oothiswatohand sai4: "It is now
at half past three, the mineeting will be
mn session at fouear. You have got
haif an hour to detegmrne upon your
answer 3" I said: "Gentlemen, this
is my answer. I have but one re
quest to make of you. If your obaject
is my assassination, do it upon the
street, and spare my family this dis
a graceful and cowardly scene."
During the campaign it was impos
aible for the Republicans to hold any
meeting. Open threats of assassina
tion were made. \ iolence in every 1
form was offered. I was insulted on
the streets; not by one man, but by 4
half a dosen, who wanted to take my i
life. I saw Col. Burke, who told me
to keep away or I would be killed. s
WVhen I went up to Campte to make I
a speech on the Saturday before the i
election, I met a lot of men armed i
with bowie-knives, sticking out of i
their scabbards. I said to some Re- c
pubpnlican friends: "It will not do to i
have any meeting to-day. Let us go 1
home, back to Natchitoches." Just I
then a company of cavalry, under i
some Lieutenant came up; and the a
moment these parties saw the cavalry i
come, they rushed into the stores and I
- took out their arms; and then we
i had a peaceable meeting. But the t
a cavalry was present. 1
r I know that there was not a full
1, and fair registration in the parish--I
- know it; for on the day of the slec
- tion I was in Natchitoches, and a I
number of colored men came to me
and asked if they could vote I I
s said: "You can vote I presume, if
d you have registered properly ? "Well, I
i they said, we could not register." It
asked why ? They said, "they would I
not let us register." That was their c
answer. I know at the poll, at :
r Campte, ward 4, there were a hun
Sdred and seventy votes of colored f
I men rejected; and that was on ac- I
count of misnames. I remember one c
man named Baptiste, and the name
, was speelled B-a-t t-i-c-e, instead of
8 B-a-p-t-i-s-t-e, and his vote was re- a
Sjected.
j I know that other Republican lead- I
ers were prevented from taking an #
r active part in the campaign. The I
1 Senator from the District was one a
. among them. I was the only Repub
- lican who did take an active part;
and I did it at the risk of my life. t
- My brother-in-law, Col. Levy's broth- I
;or, came to me and begged me to *
r quit the Republican party. "You are t
, subject, he said, at any moment to be
shot, or have it knife run in your
back." I said, "Is it possible that I t
, am liable to be assassinated." He
B said, "I am connected with you by I
marriage and will do my utmost to t
protect you; but I could not begin to t
. do it,'I was told by my brother-in- t
. law; and several of my friends re- t
fused to speak to me on account of a
f this pressure brought to bear upon (
Sthem.
Now, I will state that before I
I joined the Republican party, no such
- feeling existed against me. I occepi- .
ed positions, and I never was slight- I
I ed to my recollection before. But
e sir, it is very different now. I nl
n derstand that they have seized my i
Sproperty worth three or four thou
I sand dollars for a judgment debt of
fifteen. That is a piece of their per
p secution.
Q. State whlether you were in the £
D town of Natchitoches at the time they
j forced the officials to resign f
A. I was present.
e Q. State how it was done ? Did
k you see a large number of people?
It A. Yes, on the 27thlof July, 1874,
e they held a mass meeting, and a rea
'olution was adopted requesting D. I
IH. Bonult, Tax Collector; H. C. My- I
, er, District Judge; D. H. annllt,
SJr., Judge, and Mr. Bossier, Parish
, Attorney, to resign. They had a
, very large meeting; most of tihe per
esons present were armned. I even
I noticed arms upon gentlemen, on that
Sday, that I never saw wearing arms(
n before,.
e Q. What was the number assem
, bled 1
SA. I suppose five or six hundred,
o probably more.
i Q. Did you see any there from
e other parishes f
l A. Yes, I saw a gentleman from
I Winn paRtish, and a gentleman from I1
- Red River parish.
[ Q. In this crowd
SA. Yes, and they took part in the I
e meeting.
SQ. State any act of violence or any
n thing they did in furtherance of their
, object.
I A. A Committee of nine was ap-i
if pointed to call upon these gentlemen.
I. Mr.'Boullt and Henry C. Myers had
'r left town three days before, and con
I, sequently they were not called upon.
S'This Committee of nine went to
* Doctor Boullt's office, the tax collec
" tor..
If Q. Do yeou know what took place
Le at Dr. Boullt's office
I, A. In his house I don't know. I saw
" the crowd go there, and I saw them
It come aout. On that day I was stand
l ing im a commanding position so as to
o be able to see. Some one remarked:
I- "What are they doing at Dr. Boullt's
'ah bouse " add one of their crowd re
I marked, "that they went up there tb
." hang that God damned scoundrel." I
y, said, "I would lik6 to see them do
Ie it." !e then said tome, "We will
g. hang you, if you don't look out." 1
it sSid. "You just, try, to hang me."
d Thgn Col. Russell, who was in com
mr mand of a company of White Leag
I aers, said: "Tlhis must bea stopped,
y we must have no disiiculty here to
', day.
S I know they went to Dr. Boulit's
n house.
" Q. Do you know whether they had
a the Doetor to his house for soIme
m- times ?
- A. I know they we~it there.
I: Q. He is a Doctor t
0 A. He was a Deantist. He is a old
. reldeit, and owned a good deal of
m property there before the war.
SQ, How lengJias h lived theref
I A. He has been there'ever since I
Id cam recollect.
w eQ. How long has Judge Myers lived
e there?
it A. About twenty years I suppose.
ir In connection with this assassination,
is I will state.
Q. By Mr. Malrr.-What assassina.
tion ?
A. This attempted assnssination.
Q. What attempted ass:issination
A. My own. On the night of the
4th of November, when in company
with some gentlemlen, Democrats,
who were compiling the returns, we
had a discussion about ward No. 9,
which they wanted to throw out. I
objected to it. They wanted to throw
it out on account of a little Infiormmali
tyv, it was not properly headed. I
stated thatl I wanted the vote comn- 1
piled. They overruled me-I then l
got Col. Burke to draw up an agree- (
ment, that all the papers connected
with ward No. 9, should be forward- I
ed to the Returning Board, to be left
to their decision. We agreed to that. º
Immediately ,tnftert that, I started (
home. This was at half past nine
o'clock at night. On leaving the (
room I called the Supervisor of Reg
istration to talk to him privately. As
I got to the Court house door from i
where we had been compiling the re
turns, I stepped out on the steps in I
front of'the door, and I saw some
one sitting on the steps-I remarked: :
"Let us step aside." We stepped
aside and as we went from the Court º
house step to the outside, this man i
got up from the step and was joined I
by a man at the corner; and another
one came from around the Court
house. Then as I was addressing
this man, one of these three men who t
had on a slouched hat and an over e
coat, staggered up to me. I saw his
figure but I did not see his face. lie t
was a tall mami ; the two others were I
following. They passed me about t
fifteen steps. i noticed them hecause, I
as I tell you, I have been in dread of t
my life, and I watched those men. I r
went on talking; they started to 4
conice back, and just as this tall man a
came up I turned around; he threw a a
pistol right in my face and tired. I a
started to go into the Courthouse and a
he tired a second shot, and as I put (
my foot on the step of the Court e
house be fired a third shot. I went e
in and staid. "Boy's, this is not fair, r
this is assasination." The whole a
room was in commotion. Mr. Pierson I
asked, "what is the matter f" I told i
them, "they have attempted my as- a
sassination." One of them said, "go II
in this dark room, and we will pro- I
tect you." I walked in there and I
called upon some of my intimate I
friends, Democrats, and asked them t
to escort me home. I came down in s
town the next day, and I received
two or three letters from my friends, I
telling me to get home immediately a
and not to be caught out at dark.
One of my friends told me, "don't a
you leave this house under any cir- i
eumstances." lHe told me there were
men standing ready for mre, and lie
named one nman with a double bar- I
rolled shot gun, and le told me not
to mention his hiame, or they would
probably do away with him. I re- t
mained in my house; my house aI
perfect arsenal, and remained there
that week unable to make my es
cape, and finally I did make it by t
leaving my house at half past two
o'clock in the morning, and riding
eighteen miles to take a steamboat.
I had, while I was at home, some a
gentlemen who lhad my welfare at
heart, although belonging to the
femocratic party come to me. One
them came to my house and told
me that two Texans had been em- t
ployed, and strange to say, by a man
high in position, to assassinate me.
And lie said, "I heg yon never to a
mention may namne." I
Gentlemen, that has been told me
who this person was, and I will here :
state that Wmn. M. Levy was that a
man who offered money to persons to I
take my life.
Q. Congressman elect?
. A. Congressman elect and my old
law partner. That I will prove by
the gentleman who toldd mne. And Ihe
was heard to remark on his arrival 1
from the Baton rouge Convention:l
'"My God, do you let him live here ?
Why' don't you kill him " 1 was
bolstering up the Republican party, I
and thIe only man who stood up at
that time for what I believe was
Iright; my princilples and my rights.
Q. You have been so long in the l
parish, can you state any murders of
colored men that have occurred
A. The most notable one oecurred
in Angust. I don't know that thiat 1
was on account of politics. I know

or eight men and killed after lhe had
run in his hlouse. He had recdived a
Iwound I am told that would have
proven fatal any how; beeause tihe

me. After he got in the housem and
locked himself In, several young men
who pursned him, broke tire deoor
open and fired upon himi as he was
lying on the floor, amid killed himu
dead.

Q. Do you know what effect this

A. Yes, I know from the fact that
they camae to me to know what in the
world they were going to 1do; they
were afraid; they could not go to
meetings and could not ride from one
plantation to anether. I counseled
peace and told them, "Let them go
on. It will end some of these days.
You hlave nothing to do with it; and
never yon take an arm." I made a
speech to a lar ge nnmber of colored
men. An article had appeared in
the Jslletin stating that a large nun
ber or stands of arms had been sent
to a place at the Twenty Four Mile
Ferry, in my parish. We were going
to have a liarbeeie there. Mr. Levy
remarkedl: "I suppose you are going,
down to distribute those arms f" I
said: "You had better come down
and see."' I addressed the meeting
and as I was speaking I noticed eight
or ten Democrats there, and it oc
curred to me to speak of these stands
of arms. I told them that if they
ever raised their hands against the
white men, I thought their destiny was
settle forever. They did reply in a
loud voice, "We have no idea of do
ing it." I believe that after this
speech was made I was charged with
having made an inflamatory speech.
I told the people in town, "I am glad
I had some of your own men present."
I called ulpon them and they stated
that I had made a most conservative
speech.
