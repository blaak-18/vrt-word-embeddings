Hard Money vs. Currency.
The question of finance seems a
leading one in the political contest in
both, Pennsylvania and Ohio, and
the manner in which the republicans
dodge the hard money and paper de
mands, is ingenious to say the least
of it. The second plank in the Ohio
platform reads thusly:
2. That the policy of finance should
be steadily pursued, which without
unnecessary shock to business or
trade, will ultimately equalize the
purchasing capacity of the coin and
paper dollar.
Now we all know and believe that
well enough; but how do our repub
lican opponents propose to equalize
the purchasing capacity of a paper
dollar' with that of a coin dollar?
The above plank to our mind, is
vague and unsatisfactory, and we
doubt not, will be so to the great ma
jority of the intelligent voters of
Ohio. The policy which the republi
cans have been pursuing for the past
sixteen years, of disbursing more
money than is received from seve
nue, will not bring about the era of
equalizing, for a long time, and the
impatience of the American people
to have an honest, economical gov
ernment, will brook no delay. That
economy and honesty can never be
had from a republican administra
tion. The republicans might have
explained in a few words to the vo
ters of Ohio, how they proposed to
bring about this millennial era of
equalization. Not, we hope, in $42,
000,000 deficits, as last year; not
with exhausted appropriations on the
1st of June, in the departments of
the Interior and Justice ; no such ex
travagance would ever "equalize."
The currency is well enough and
good enough, if it were only properly
managed, and in taking Morton, Lo
gan, Conklin, Blain, and other re
publican lights, as examples of mone
tary knowledge, we are of the opin
ion that, that party has adearth, even
of third rate financiers, hence the
utter impossibility of these men and
that party, to grasp the subject; a
subject requiring deep study and the
ripest mind, well stored with a cor
rect and practical -knowledge of po
litical economy. The class ot men
the republicans have been sending
to the legislative halls of the Union,
are not up to that standard, they are,
on the contrary, of the "fog horn"
sort, successful or broken down Gen
erals, Colonels, &c., whom an over
generous constituency elected, as a
matter of reward, no doubt, to make
laws for our country, and a pretty
mess they have made. A General
like Logan, for instance, "bearded
like the pard," may seek danger and
be successful, even at the cannon's
mouth, but when he advances his
lines against a power unseen, but
which permeates, not only the land
of the bloody Southern rebel, bat
throughout the commercial world, he
finds his windy army of words com
pletely flanked by the stern logic of
fixed facts. Pennsylvania puts it in
this wise:
"8. Free banking, a safe and uni
form National currency, adjhsted to
the growing wants of the business
interests of the country, and a steady
reduction of the National debt;"
But this stops short of releif, or
even a show of relief; both these
planks are simply sound political ax
ioms, which must be followed out by
a strong and healthy power to acoom
plish-both have been standing para
graphs in every work on political
economy ever written, and it seems
ridicalous that the republican party
after being in power so long; after
having the entire management of the
financial affairs of the government in
that time, slould now go back to the
abe study of the simple rules of
finance. At this rate a lease of pow
er for a hundred years would be re
quired, that they might learn that
the eonfideace is the ability and desire
of the government to redeem its cur
rency at asy time hes 'called upoen,
will make at once the paper dollar
equal to the gold dollar; thisconfi
dence must not only be instilled by
wise legislation into our own citizens,
but the commercial world abroad
must also be inspired with the knowl
edge that our goerameat is preTpared
on demand to redeem its paper ieasue
with gold.
The leading question with all po
litical economists is; how far currency
shoold be restrained, and we contend
that at this moment there is an abun
dance ot currency in this country,
which will only yield to circulation
when a commodity for sale comes in,
and demands it. Invetmentain pub
lie improvements from natural causes,
have ceased in this country, the crash
of 1878 has made capitalists.wary of
lending money upon fecticious securi
ty, such as the various stocks of the
numerous true and false corporations,
with which the money markete have
been lSooded-and here we see anoth
er example of that want of eonfidence,
and until that is restored by some
healthy reaction, and wise legislation
will bring -that about, we may look
for a dearth in the supply of money,
although the banks may be full to
overlowing. Why is it that money
only commands on Wall street, the
moneyed center of the Union, 2fper
cent per annum 7 Does not thabt sbhdw

Moiey Ii notwhastis required, but-a
vera to the pi6p. adjustlaient of
the ettil and spendian ofthe na
tional wealth, the passage of laws for
the benefit of the citizen, not to per
petuate party power, let this be done
and the currency will restore itself.
Are the republicans prepared to do
this? We think not, for virtue has
fled their ranks, no wise statesmen
remain among these plunderers, the
bond of union that binds them to
gether will not admit of ought else
in their legislation, save to make all
they can at the expence, not only of
our homes, but of the National credit.
Give us wise financiers to adjust the
matter, to economise the expenditures
of the government, to instill confi
dence in our people and those abroad
of our willingness, (the ability is well
known) to meet our obligations lwhen
due, and you will then see plenty of
greenback dollars, and they as good as
gold dollars.
Death of Capt. Allen Wheel
er, Sr.
This venerable and well esteemed
citizen of this parish, died very sud
denly in Hopkins county, Texas, on
the night of the 2d of July. He was
visiting his daughter residing in that
State, and retired to his rest in his
usual hedalth, during the night the
family were aroused by a nosle in
his room and found him dead in his
bed, without apparent cause.
He was seventy-nine years of age,
a native of North Carolina, and re
moved to this State from Hawkins
county, Georgia, in the year 1856.
He served with the rank of Cap
tain in the Florida war of Jackson's
Administration, until the close of
hostilities. His many friends and ac
quaintances in this and adjoining
parishes, will regret the loss of this
deserving fellow-citizen. """
Rail Road,
There is, at this moment, much
talk of railroads, what that talk,
which we have heard from boylhoods
early days, will amount to, remains
to be seen." At all events, the road
has got into the hands of the citizens
of New Orleans, who are more inter
ested in its completion than others,
and should it not now be built, we
do not know when to look for a peo
ple who will invest money for our
benefit. We understand that Mr. E.
B. Wheelock, a prominent merchant
of the city of New Orleans, and deep
ly interested in public improvements
in, and the development of the natu
ral resources of Louisiann, will be in
our city in a few days, and we would
desire to see if our people will do
anything to advance, materially,
their own interest.
Confusion, worse Confounded
in Grant Parish,
We had occasion to publish the
statement of many of the citizens
of Grant parish, of the muddle in
to which the, courts of that par
ish plunged the sweet-scented radi
cal officials of that locality, some two
weeks ago, by the conviction of Phil
lips and others, of divers misdemean
ors, together with the indictment of
Shelby, the Deputy Sheriff, for the
murder of Needham Walters.
The Court ordered the Sheriff to
take his prisoners to the Alexandria
jail, there being none in Colfal. This
lie deliberately refused to do, but on
the contrary, gave all his prisoners
their liberty, and among others turn
ied loose two sentenced conviets to
the penitentiary, one of them being
for murder. These, togethe with
Phillips the notorious, committed and
sentenced for two misedemeanors and
indicted for perjury, murder and ar
son, fled the conotry on or about the
night of the 24 of July.
On a motion for contempt, in the
Parish Court last week, the Sheriff
was fined $500 and suspended from
his office, and young Mr. Kellum, of
Montgomery, appointed, who )maving
given the bond required by law, ap
pointed C. C. Nash as his Deputy.
Up to the last accoaunt, McCoy had
refused to deliver the warrants and
other papers of his office, that had
been secreted, but had promised to
do so on the 8th, as the law abiding
citizena of the parish were about to
make it rather warm for him. It ais
said that he and Phillips made every
possible effort to excite the negroes
to another iosurrection, but failed en
tirely to enlist their sympathies in
any way.
It Is to be hoped that the new ap
pointments of Sheriffrand Deputy will
be theim beginning of a new order of
things in this parish, that they will
be successfal in recovering the pris
oners and in 'restorilg law and order
to that much vexed community.

The Tariff.
The consideration of the tariff ques
tion will agitate tile public mind of
these States ; now that the American
people have recovered from tile blind
partizan warfare against a section of
the common Union, and legislation
will cease to be had simply to choke
out and destroy the liberties of the
Southern people, to a very great ex
tent, and the matter which was sup
posedt to be settled as far back as
1816, must now come up for final ad
justment.
In the infancy of our government,
the policy of extending protection to
home manufactories was doubted by
some of our wisest statesmen, and in
reading up the views given to both
sides of the question during a series
of years of discussion, we can but ad
mit that, although it fostered a branch
of industry carried to considerable
extent in one part of the Union only,
our fathers did a wise and politic
thing in throwing around their infant
ile factories the strong and protect
ing arm of the government. But like
all questions, all acts of good political
imports; acts that conservatively
passed and executed would tend to
work good to the community of States;
the tariff has been twtisted and push
ed beyond all bounds of reason, and
has become the cloak of the monopo
list. To now seriously argue the
right further to continue in force laws
known as "high protective tariffs,'"
would, we think, place the stateman
who favored it in a rather awkward
delema.
Our country has grown in size, po
palation and power; able in a'physi
cal and moral sense to cope with the
most powerful ot human governments,
and all our industries have kept pace
with growth of the country, would it
then be wise to continue to protect
an industry established upon a firm
basis to the detriment of other branch
es of revenue to our people. Trade
is regulated by the fixed laws of sup
ply and demand, and the wants of
communities will search for their sup
plies in the cheapest and best mar.
kets. Is it justice to the American
people that this government, by high
tariffs, should force its citizens to pur
chase their iron, salt, coal, hardware
and clothing from home manufactures
at higher rates than they can be had
for abroad t For bear in mind that
as we advance rates of tariff the wily
manufacturer advances the prices of
his goods. Upon its face, to the con
sumer, it bears evidence of great in
justice, for if our industries here at
home, with all the raw material near
at hand cannot compete with foreign
manufactories, we had better close
our shops and invest the capital thus
locked up in some other and more
profitable business,.
Politicians take advantage of the
ignorance of the masses and from the
hustings treat the question in a sense
of an appeal to interest; to the in
terest of thIe labor employed, and
studionsly avoid to touch the subject
in a point of view of political econo
my. How often have we heard of
the wages that hands in our mines
and factories redived in advance of
that obtained in Europe; bat we
have as let failed to hear the states
msa follow up the simile, that in this
advance of wages paid, they are com
polled to pay a proportionate ad
vance for the necessaries of life, that
their reot, fod add clothing, advance
with even pace with their wages. I-*
lIstratiug which we will say that a
laborer receives when the tariff is
simply to afford a revenue, not to
protect industries, one dollar and fifty
cents per day, he pays one dollar per
day tolive, now let this be a "high
tariff," he receives two dollars and
fifty cents per day wages and pays
two dollars, so it will be seen that
all the laborer gets is the simple satie
faction of receiving higher wages and
the pleasure of splendid more money,
if there be any pleasure or satisfac
tion in it, without the privilege of
laying up acent more for a "rainy
day." But hIe is doing maore than
thirg he is fostering and building up
monopolies, the power of which is
now being felt by the thousands out
of employment in the Eastern and
Middi8tates, and whose exhorbitant
deus ii A ,wll nigh destroying
the government.
Let us then argue, and.vote only
for such tariff laws as will afford rev
enue to our government and at the
same time not clog trade with anyi
restraint or be a cloak and shield for
hideous monopolies tm, ersh and grind
the people.
The cotton erops of the parish
are in fine condition as far as we
can learn. Corn, however, is not
so, having suftered in many sec
Sions from the extreme drought.
This is bad, and had our planters
put more acreage in corn than
they did, the- loss would have
been made up; it seems the same
old story, cotton engrossed all at
tention. We can never expect to
be a prosperouas people until we
raise our own bread and meat.

Our Trade With Shreveport.
It seems strange that we should
continue to so long everlook a direct
and profitable channel to the North
ern marts and that we should follow
still the line of travel and transfer
pursued by our ancestors, via the
tortuous and difficult to be navigated
length of Red River from this to the
mouth, rather than the quick and
easy transit from hence to Shreve
port and then by rail direct North.
In an article, in a late mumber of
the Shreveport lime, we notice it ad
verts to a line of steamers between
that city and this, and it is an enter
prise to which we will give our most
cordial support. For nothing so se
riously interupt our business titan
this everlasting pulling and hauling
to reach New Orleans and a market,
in low water. Trade, like water, will
seek the nearest and cheapest route
to its level-a market-and we are
ashamed to confess we have to this
moment stumbled blindly along with
out thinking once of this near outlet
via Shreveport.
We see that planters from as low
down as Grapp's Bluff are shipping
cotton up to Shreveport, where the
staple commands as good, if not bet
ter, price than in lew Orleans, and
we understand the nett proceeds are
not cut down by such exhorbitant
charges for brokerage. Hauling,
storing freight and commissions, in
Shreveport, as in our Queen city.
To more fully test this matter let
some of our enterprising citizens
make shipments of cotton to Shreve
port and practical illustration, will,
we venture to say, convince us of the
fact that we have not in the past
looked close enough to home for a
good market for our prodpco. Then
in the matter of merchandise, we are
at a loss to see why Shreveport, with
its cheap railroad tariff and its low
rents cannot undersell New Orleans,
even if our merchants desire to pur
chase there, while at her back is St.
Louis, Chicago, Ciaciunatti Philadel
phia and New York, where we could
be supplied with all we require from
first hands. Let this question be ag
gitated and a no distant day we opine
such a thing will exist and will pay'

The Bart Able brought up from
New Orleans, Tuesday last, the

well as willing to accommodate
the people.
Crops m North Louisiana.
Minden Democrat, 10th:
There are localities in our parish
that have had no rain in 8 or 10 weeks
and the corn crops will probably be
a failure. Thie cotton in these dis
tricts is looking finely, and it is hoped
that the deficit in corn will be met
by the increase in the yield of cotton.
These sections or localities are not
numerous nor extensive. The crops,
as a general thing, were never better.
We had cool showemrs yesterday and
the day before.
Coushatta Citizen :
We have bad an abundance of rain
all over the parish.

very few exceptions, every neighbor
hood have had as much as they want

You are to understand, however,
that the remission of penalties does
not operate to postpone colleetions

Railroad Prospects.
It will be gratifying to the friends
of the enterprise and encouraging to
the community at large to know that
subscriptions for the Texas Railroad
are being liberally made wherever
the canvassers have thus far gone.
Already quite a large amount has
been secured, and it is safe to say
that at the next meeting of the Di
rectory the announcement will be
made of the *150,000 necessary to
begin the work with. A single mem
ber of the committee has on his book
now $85,000 and if his colleagues
have been even approximately sne
cessful, the conditions precedent to
the inauguration of the undertaking
will hisve been complied with.
It may not be out of 'place to men
tion just here that the scheme of the
company effectually avoids the error
too common in such enterprises, to
wit: the isesue of bonds based on imn
aginary, or at best prospective secu
rity. We are assured that the direc
tors do not contemplate issuing a sin
gle bond until the road shall have
been thrown up, graded, cross-tied
and ironed from Alexandria to Natch
itoches. The project will have to be
an assured success before they invoke
the aid of mortgage bonds, or ap
peal to any source other than the
public spirit and liberality of their
fellow-citizens of Louisiana. This
is a proper and wholesome feature of
the plan, and it is especially reas
suring to observe that there is every
indication of its being thoroughly
adhered to.
The Committee on (Subscription
have thus far met with most gratify
ing success. The public seems to
be practically awake to the necessity
of the projected railway, and we feel
perfectly confident that when the ad
mirable and. intelligent system of so
liciting devised by the Directory shall
have been put in operation the result
will be everything that the most ar
deint advocates of the enterprise
could desire.
The present prospect is that the
work can be begun by the 15th inst.,
and that before the end of the year
the long looked for and sadly needed
Texas Railroad will be a fact patent
and tangible to all.-Picayune.

BUSINEss.-As a convincer to our
croakers that the new Railroad Di
rectors mean business, we will state
that they have issued a card in the
Democrat of to-day for "sealed pro

and will receive up to the Ist prox.,
"at the company's ofioee, No. 38 Mag

for the following described work:
All the graduation, grubbing and
cleaning between Alexandia and
Natchitoches, 60 miles, more or less."
Also "for Cypress Cross Ties for the
whole distance or for a section of one
mile. The ties to be 9 feet long,
hewed on two parallel sides, to a face
of 7 inches heart and 7 inches thick."
All the latter to be distributed over
the line as will hereafter be directed
by the Chief Engineer, at the rate of
2640 to the mile.-Alexandria Demo

The Portland Press says:
By far the most important of the
issues now before the people of the
United States is that which relates to
the currency.
To which the New York Sun says:
This is not so. The currency is an
inmportant thing no doubt, but it is of
trifling eonsequence compared with
the question whether the affairs of thie
country shall be administered by
thieves or by honest men.
If plundering and swindling are to
be the rule ,in public life, it makes
very little difference whether the cur
rency is paper or coin. Let as rst
drive the robbers out of the temple
of our republican freedom and then
we shall be prepared toeonsider what
sort of money is most convenient and
beneficial.
By far the most important of the
issues now before the people of the
United States is that which relates to
honesty and economy in publi af

Washington, D. C.:
DEAR SIR-Having been a retmbi.
can ever since the present republin
party 'ras formed, and having' ev.
voted any other Federal ticket tie
the republican, I claim the right to
call your attention to a matter whbi
lies within the control of your s.
mittee, and which threateas to n.
jure the republican party by age.
ating from it a large mass of its ap.
porters.
I have been so nnfortunate as t.
displease the central and chief org
of the republican party-the Walh.
ington National Republican-by uam
letters in the New York Herald om.
taming the results of investlgatiuos
into the political and industrial ee.
dition of several Southern State;
and your organ accordingly inferm
its readers, in an editorial urtic,
which has just come into my hahds
that I ought not to be believed-not
because I have misetated facts, or
am an incapable or inaccurate obser
ver-but on the ground that I am a
"Dutch Jew," "Dutch" standing here,
of course, for German. I have noti.
ced that ignorant Americans con
monly call the Germans "Dutch."
Now, if I were, in the Organ's ele
gant phrase, a "Dutch Jew," I don't
see what that has to do with the reld.
ibility of my statements. I am, is
fact, a German, and am proud of my
descent from a people who have begs
the faithful supporters of liberty f
two continentS. I am not a Jew, het
if I were, I should not be ashamed of
it; for the Jews in this country an
an intelligent, industrious and pea
able body of citizens.
But the Organ thinks diferedilt.
Speaking in the name of the repubi
can Administration, whose mou&.
piece it is, it has the folly toaert
that if a man is a German by bletd
he is therefore not to be believed; if
lie is a Jew by religion lie is thereby
unworthy of confidence.
Is this really republican doctrinet
If not, is it prudent in you to allow
your organ to offer such a waste
insult to a very large number of eiti
