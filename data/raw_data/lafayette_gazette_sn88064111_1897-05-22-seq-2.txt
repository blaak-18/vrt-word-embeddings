OFFICIAL JOURAL OF THIS PARISH,
-atered at the Lafayette La. Post-Office as Second
Clasujlfater.
SATURDAY, MAY 22, 1897.
Gov. Bob Taylor of Tennessee
will resign to go on the lecture plat
form.
Wimberly and Demas seem to be
running the Washington end of Louis
iana politics just now. The Lily
whites are interested spectators.
The Daily Item is very compli
mentary to Gov. McEnery. The
friends of the governor should see
that it is stopped.
Ben Tillman may or may not be
a crank, but he is eminently right in
his stand relative to the investiga
tion of the senate-sugar trust scan
dal.
The Gazette was pleased to re
ceive the initial number of the
Algiers Bulletin, a very bright
weekly edited by Paul J. Christian,
who is evidently a writer of consid
erable ability. The Gazette wishes
its contemporary a prosperous
career.
Mrs. Lease says the Oklahoma
cloud-burst was the work of Proyi
dence. We are Inclined to the
opinion that the same power that
caused the awful catastrophe must
be responsible for the infliction of
Mrs. Lease upon the public.
Major C. J. Thompson, who has
been making things hum of late in
the way of putting up and placing
machinery preparatory to starting
his pipe factory, informs us that he
has sent off for several bushels of
corn which grows a large size cob.
-Opelousas Courier.
In rebuttal to the charge some
times made, that printers are "bad
men," statistics show that of 3800
convicts in the Texas penitentiary
not one is a representative of the art
preservative, while there are minis
ters, doctors, bankers, barbers,
photographers, barkeepers, cooks
and members of all other profes
sions and callings.--Daily States.
If dispatches are to be believed
the Senate will have another sugar
trust investigation on its hands.
The Washington correspondent of
Chicago Times-Herald has made
the charge over his signature that
three senators used information ac
quired by virtue of their official po
sition to speculate on stock in the
sugar trust. If the Senate cares
for its reputation it will investigate
these charges and establish the cor
rectness or falsity of these accusa
tions. No honorable body would
consent to remain under such an
imputation.
NOT SO "FARCICAL."
The Iberian thinks it is "decided
ly farcical" because the Democrats
of Lafayette nominated a municipal
ticket. Not so funny, Weeks.
The same thing is done in all coun
tries where political parties exist.
The Iberian says that what is
"wanted in corporation elections is
a board of directors or trustees to
manage the finances of the town."
That is very true, but why not
select competent Democrats to fill
the offices of directors and trustees.
We all know that the fate of the
Dingley bill did not depend upon
the result of the municipal election,
but we would like to know how
the editor of the Iberian proposes
to maintain a party organization if
the question of politics is to be left
out of local elections. It is a well
known fact that the Republicans
generally vote the same ticket.
With them are nearly always found
the Populists and all elements op
posed to the Democracy. And yet
the Iberian thinks it is "decidedly
arcical" because the Democrats
refused to be led , to political
.slaughter by their enemies without
even making a mild protest. The
breed of Democrats described by
the Iberian don't roam in these
diggaings. The genuine article up
here believes in lighting all along
bhe line.
AN PR AG7 ZAL Nl KINAEY
MA4V."
In 18g when William /McKinley
was nominated for governor by the
Republicans of Ohio, our friend,
Paul Demanade, though at a long
distance from the Buckeye State,
was intensely interested in the re
sults of that memorable campaign.
He watched the different phases of
the contest and at no time did his in
terest in its outcome lag in the least.
He communicated with the Hon.
Wm. M. Hahn, chairman of the
Ohio State Committee, and in his
own humble way did his part for
the success of the ticket. At the end
of the campaign when it became
known that the apostle of protec
tion had been elected, Chairman
Hahn, of t Ohio Central Com
mittee, iqpt Wr. Demanade a life
size portait of the successful can
didate. Of course Mr. DiQinanade
was naturally pleased at this evi
dence of appreciation on the part
of Chairman Hahn, and he lost no
time to have the picture neatly
framed. He placed it in the post
office of which he was in charge
and left it there until the expiration
of his term as post-master, but he
carried his present with him and
hung it up in his place of business,
where it now stands as a constant
reminder that the proprietor of the
establishment is not a recent con
vert of "McKinleyism," but
is what may be appropriately
termed an "original McKinley
man." Shortly after Mr. Demanade
became the owner of the picture he
secured the services of an itinerant
painter, who wrote the word "tariff"
immediately above the distinguished
figure of the chief-executive.
It is needless to say that Mr.
Demanade is not only proud of his
picture, but is equally proud of the
fact that before the Ohioan was
mentioned for the presidency he
pinned his faith to him and to his
policies and to-day he flatters him
self that his judgment was correct
and his choice was ratified by the
Republicans of the Union.
A JUST TAX.
Because the Legislature of New
York has passed a law to tax in
heritances the capitalistic papers
refer to it as an evidence of the ex
istence of a socialistic sentiment
which threatens the life of the Re
public. Every time an effort is
made to compel the moneyed-class
to pay the government its just dues
the same howl of "anarchy" and
"socialism" is raised. A high tariff
suits them. It exacts as much
from the day laborer as it does
from the multi-millionaire. A high
tariff robs the poor for the benefit
of the wealthy manufacturer, but
they tell us it is for the protection
of American industries and Ameri
can workmen. A tax on inherit
ances is to equalize the burden of
taxation and make the rich man
contribute his share, but we are
coolly informed by the possessors
of hoarded capital that such a tax
is class legislation, populistic and
unconstitutional.
.The Supreme court of the
United States have wisely or un
wisely decided that the income tax
was unconstitutional, and it be
hooves every legislature in the
Union to follow the example of the
solons of the Empire State and
enact laws that will be the means
of compelling the hoarders of idle
capital to perform the first duty of
the citizen-make a fair and pro
portionate contribution to support
the government which affords them
protection.
Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilei
In its June number The Ladies' Home
Journal will celebrate the Diamond Jubilee
in a way distinctly its own. In an article
by William Georg- Jordan, entitled "What
Victoria HIas Been," the reader will be taken
on the riBritish thorne, and the marvelous
panorama of the world's history for sixty
years will pass before him. He will at a
glance see the progress in art, science inven
tion, music, education; the great social re
forms, the growth of nations and the ad
vance of civilization. The whole story of
the 'world's progress of the longest reign
in English history will be vividly presented.
What, a Polar Bear ?
A Frenchman went to an American and
said to him: "What a polar bear ? " The
American answered: "What does a polar
bear do ? I don't know. Why, he sits on
ice." Sits on se ice ?" "Yes," said
the American, "tl is nothing elsew to sit
on." "Vell vat he do, too ? " "What
does he also do P Why eats fish." "Then
I not accept." "Why, what do you mean,
You don't accept ? What do you mean I "
"Oh, non, non, IK does not accept. I was
invited to be polar bear to a funeral!"

Of all monopolies, the monopoly
of land is the most injurious to the
general welfare of the people and is
calculated, more than any other, to
throw a damper on the patrotism of
the citizen.
When God created man a land
animal, he bequeathed to mankind,
(to past, present and all future gen
erations of the human family) the
inalienable right of usufruct in
the land to draw from it every thing
necessary to life, sustenance and
comfort. Man's body comes from
the land and goes back to the land;
his existence is so indissolubly
welded to it, that it cannot be sepa
rated from it more than the existence
of a fish can be separated from
water, and it is a law of nature to
appreciate, love and defend, even
unto death, that which gives life
and procures comfort, ease. and
contentment-this is the sentiment
that develops patriotism or love of
country, which has been so much
extolled among all nations. Hence
it is not only unjustt--ut it is un
wise to adopt and to tolerate a sys
tem of laws tending to foster specula
tion in land and thereby create a
monopoly of one of the -elements
indispensable to man's existence.
Why, a system of law that would
tolerate and encourage means by
which the use of air and of water
could be placed under the control
of one set or class of men, would
not be unjust, hurtful and im
politic; because man must hlve
upon the land and trom the fruit of
the land, if he live at all; his food,
clothing, shelter, and every other
thing that will tend to satisfy his
wants, natural or acquired,
comes from the land. Give
man a sea of fresh water and a cy
clone of pure air, if he is deprived,
through a system of laws or by
tyranny, of his share in that usu
fruct in land, which the Creator
has bestowed on him, he is driven
to a lingering existence and to 4
death by starvation.
Speculation in land necessarily
creates a monopoly, which causes
the price and the rent of land to
rise beyond the purchasable means
of the tillers of the soil. The conse
quences of this are: First, an im
mense area of arable land remains
idle and unproductive, when by
the laws of nature, it sho.uld be
worked to produce food and com
fort for every member of the hu
man family. Indeed it would be
impiety to suppose that God has
not provided ample means for the
existence and wants of every one of
his children. Secondly, monopoly
of land causes a deleterious check
to the development of patriotism,
as an obstacle to the acquisition of
land by those who earn their bread
by daily labor, and who, thereby
would become identified with the
soil and ready to defend their
homes. If facility were offered to
the laborer to buy or to rent land
for a fair and equitable price, he
would avail himself of it, because
it is in the nature of man to desire
a home and to be independent of
the exactions of an employer.
Monopoly of land is the cause of
that mass of unemployed men, who
are driven from the rural districts to
the great manufacturing centers,

where an unatural competition and
struggle for existence, fcompels
them to work for wages hlirdly
adequate to their daily wants.
The labor troubles, which of late
have so much disturbed the coun
try, will be renewed from time to
time, unless the means of making
an honest livelihodd are offered to
the surplus labor of the country.
How can this be done? In the
countries of the old world, emigra
tion is the relief; but in our coun
try emigration is out of the question,
for we have more uncultivated land
than necessary to feed and support
thirty or forty more million of peo
ple. The uncultivated lands,
alone can afford that relief. Wise
legislation should invite man to
seek his livelihood out of the land
in compliance with the law of
nature; but to obtain this desirable
result, some favorable (but just and
equitable) inducements should be
offered to the tillers of the soil.
A reduction in the price and rent
of land, and a homestead protec
tion, would tend toward the accom
plishment of this end. Of course,
this must be done without infringe
ment of the right of property or of
vested rights, otherwise the meas
ure would be revolutionary and
condemnable. Now, how can this
be done? Louisiana is, par excel
lence, an agricultural country; its
climate is good, its soil fertile and
with ordinary exertion will not fail
to return a fair remuneration.
WVithin the limits of the State there
are millions of acres of arable land
which lay idle and uncultivated;
these lands are owned by syndi
cates, companies and individuals, and
some are held for speculation at an
advanced price. The taxes on these
lands are small in proportion to the
taxes on improved cultivated lands;
some of them have been bought or
otherwise acquired from the gover
ment of the United -States or bought
from the State at low prices and
those, who own them, hold
them at such high prices or high
rent, that they remain idle and pro
duce nothing.
Under the present system of as
sessment and taxation, the tax on
improved cultivated lands per acre,
is, at least, ten times higher than
the tax on some of the uncultivated
lands. Supposed that the system
were reversed, and the cultivated
lands would pay a lesser tax and the
uncultivated lands the higher one ?
This would operate as a check on
the speculation in lands and conse
quently would be a blow to mo
nopolies and would compel the
owners of the uncultivated lands
to reduce the price and rent of
same to get rid of the tax, aad
thereby afford the laboring man an
opportunity to buy or rent, for the
purpose of cultivation, and procure
'a home for himself and family, and
secure that self- reliance and indepen
dence, which constitute the pride
of character of the American citizen.
Add to this a homestead of fifty
arpents to every owner of a farm in
cultivation, with exemption from
seizure for debt, and the number
of unemployed laborers will soon
diminish and be replaced by an in
dustrious and patrotic yeomanry.
