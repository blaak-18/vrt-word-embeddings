THE MISSENT VALENTINE
Sy M. TL. Sradley.
I never met a handsome and at
tractive bachelor, or a charming old
maid —and I meet lots of them —but
what I surmise that a romance is
locked in the secret recesses of their
hearts that Avould be very interest
ing if I could get them to reveal it.
But the ones that have the most ro
mantic heart histories are the very
ones that are most redluetant to di
vulge them.
Some such thought was passing
through my mind the other evening
when I dropped into my friend, Went
worth’s bachelor quarters, and found
him enjoying himself, with his feet on
the fender, and box of choice Ha
vanas on the table at his elbow. He
invited me to take a seat and help
myself, which I accordingly did.
While I was puffing away at the
fragrant weed, my eyes wandered ad
miringly over the elegant apartment.
I noted its air of refined luxury. Its
chaste display of wealth. My eye
finally rested upon the owner, and I
mentally pronounced him a fitting
center to the whole. It suddenly oc
curred to me as singular that he had
never maried. I recalled that it was
a subject that he never mentioned
even jestingly, as most men do. He
was the kind of man that women ad
mire. Handsome, affable, with a kind
of chivalrous courtesy that no woman
could be absolutely indifferent to. He
was popular at the club, and in busi
ness circles was considerd of unfailing
integrity.
“What makes you so serious?”
The unexpected abruptness of the
question startled me, and I blurted
out the curiosity that was in my
mind.
“I was wondering why you had
never married?”
The ghost of a smile passed over
his fine face, and I thought I detected
the suspicion of a sigh.
“This, the fourteenth of February,
is the anniversary of my only ro
mance. I was just thinking of it
when you came in. If you care to
hear of the misfortunes of a ver
dant, but well intended youth, I wijl
relate it to you.”
I assured him that nothing could
afford me greater pleasure, as it was
just what I was longing to hear.
“I have always maintained that
first love is the only one that has the
flavor of real feeling about it. You
may pass through a hundred fancies.
You may know attachment that is
lasting, and even tender. But that
wild love —that steeps your senses in
a delirious and unreasoning passion—
that comes to man, or woman, but
once. I know that one experience of
its pain and pleasure, has been suf
ficient for me. Whether I am to be
pitied or blamed, you shall be the
judge. In my youth,” with a mirth
ful glance at me, “I aspired to poe
try. That was the head and front of
my offending. In the beautiful words
of Goethe, upon a sadly different
theme, ‘lt was my undoing.’ In othei
words, it is the real reason that I am
a bachelor tonight.”
He replaced his cigar, and began
puffing* out rings of fragrant smoke
while he gazed into the fire with a
dreamy, thoughtful look. .
I gently reminded him of the story.
“I was a youth to fortune and to
fame unknown, when chance landed
me in this city as under clerk in a
dry goods store with a third rate
boarding house for a home. I had not
been there very long before I became
acquainted with a young lady board
ing there with her mother, while
awaiting the result of a law suit
which, if they gained it, would place
them in possession of considerable
property. Delia Mason was a slender
aristocratic girl, with large velvety
black eyes and masses of black hair,
which she wore wound about her head
in a queenly fashion. She was not
what could, or would be, called a
beauty. But she possessed what is
more dangerous to susceptible young
men than mere beauty. She had a
marvelously winning way with her.
Her large black eyes would melt into
tenderness and her white teeth gleam
with a smile that was entrancing. I
soon discovered that she was quite a
belle in the house. I discovered—
but that was later on —that she, was
a past grand mistress of the art of
coquetry. But I am ahead of my
story. I have always hugged the
pleasing dilusion to my inner con
sciousness that the marked prefer
ence that Mis Mason showed me
from the first of ous acquaintance
was prompted by genuine feeling on
her j>art. Common sense, however,
whispers to my sane and practical
judgment, that it was only a part
of her usual program when snaring
a victim. I was not long in falling
in love with her. I would rather
prepare to be hung than go through
"the days that followed. There
was the usual complement of board
ers to be found in such a house.
A widower, a couple of elderly bach
elors, four or five clerks, and a
sprinkling of females to correspond.
Among the latter was an ancient
maiden by the name of Delia Hunt.
She was a little wizened faced crook
ed nosed personage with a complexion
like a seed cucumber. Little twink
ling black eyes and a scanty supply
of hair, which she remedied with
numerous braids, bangs and curls.
She appeared to see and hear every
thing that was said or done. She did
not abstain from mentioning them,
either. Generally with the preface, ‘I
overheard so and so.’ I soon discov
ered that she had interested herself
in my affairs. Whether she consid
ered herself as possessing superior at
tractions to Miss Mason I can not
say. I can only assign her desire to
meddle with my love affair to that
morbid malice that seems to be a
characteristic of that unhappy class
of females. I then believed that Miss
Mason was really attached to me. I
now know that she seized the oppor
tunity to rid herself of my too ardent
and undesirable love. As I said I be
lieved that she was as deep in love
with me as I was with her. I laid the
blame of her coolness to Miss Hunt’s
meddling. I heard Miss Mason say
one day that she was particularly
fond of pansies. Although I could ill
afford the expense, yet I purchased a
bouquet of them. As I entered the
hall with them in my hand I met
Milly Wilson, the invalid niece of the
landlady. She was also a drudge. I
pitied her and when I saw her look
©be
wistfully at the flowers I stopped to
show them to her.
“ ‘How lovely!’ she exclaimed.
‘They are my favorites, too. When
mamma lived and we had our own
home, there was always a box of them
on the window’ sill.’ She pressed
one of the velvet beauties to her wan
cheek, and yielding to a sudden im
pulse of pity I presented them to
her. The joyous look that spread over
her sad face amply repaid me the
sacrifice that I had made of my own
desires. But it instantly faded.
“‘Oh! Mr. Wentworth, you can
not really mean it. Were they not
intended for another person? I —l
cannot accept them.’
“I was in for a blunder, so I press
ed them upon her with some more
talk of a complimentary nature and
she took them away with her. As I
turned to go up stairs I saw the frail
form of Miss Delia Hunt leaning over
the baluster. Os course she reported
the scene to Miss Mason, with em
bellishments that I could only imagine.
When I entered the sitting room
that evening I found her patiently
listening to old Griggs, the widower.
He was explaining the algebracial
paradox to her. She was so deeply
interested in it that she did not per
ceive my presence for some time af
ter I had entered and passed by her
three or four times. I soon discov
ered that it was useless to expect any
notice from her that evening, so I
went into the next room and be
gan to help Milly Willson wind
z phyrs My heart was arbiug like
an ulcerated tooth, but I chatted with
Milly in as cheerful away as I could
assume. Apparently we were having
a merry time when Miss Hunt looked
in. In a few minutes after Miss Ma
son did the same.
“I now believe that she really
wanted to get rid of me, and took
the jealousy plan to do it. But I was
too verdant, and too much in love to
think of the possibility of her giving
my tender young heart such a pun
ishment. But I have since conclud
ed that I was only the victim of my
own conceit and her coquetry. It was
fun for her, but it was a terrible,
harrowing experience for me. I ma
neuvered many times to get a chance
to ask the cause of her coolness. If
she were jealous of poor Milly I could
easily explain that away. But Miss
Hunt was always in the way. She
seemed to be on the lookout for me.
She shadowed me as soon as I en
tered the house, and never relaxed her
surveillance, until the street door
banged after me. Often then if I
glanced back, I would see her head
protruding from some upper window.
So I went to the expense of hiring a
buggy one day to take Miss Mason
riding and thus force an opportunity
to declare my love. But Miss Mason
was not at home. I could not afford
to waste that buggy hire, so I invited
Milly Willson to accompany me. The
next day I had the unspeakable an
guish to see Miss Mason drove off
with old Griggs.
“That was only the beginning of
events that drove me into a fever of
jealousy. She flirted with this one
and that one. Where she had been
