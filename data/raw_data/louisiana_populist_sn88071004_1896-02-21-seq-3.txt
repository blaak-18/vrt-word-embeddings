To listen to all that has been, and
is being said concerning the grand
old Democratic party in the pres
ent campaign, a stranger might ,be
led into the fallacious belief that
there exists in this State the
' strongest k'nd of fealty to party
principl.:. The fact of the m it
t,,r is that not cven the leaders
themselves seem to know what the
fundamental principles of I)emoe
racy are. In this State, the terms,
I)temocrats and Republic ins, are
conveniently used to define, de
nominate and distinguish between
two aggregations of politicians as
piring for office. To attend their
ends, it were impossible for them
all to be lined up on the same side;
therefore, they find it necessary,
as well as convenient, for one gang
to shadow themselves under the
assumed title of Democrats, and
for the other to affect to be ardent
Republicans. As to principles,
they have none, and there would
be no shock or damage occasioned
were they to swap titles,
FOR TIEIR AIMS AND AM
BITIONS ARE IDENTICAL.
For a period of years, up to al
most two decades ago, the Repub
licans held full swing and sway in
this State, and during the greater
portion of that time, it was rather
unsafe for a man to proclaim him
self a Democrat. The conscience
Ile. and unscrupulous acts and
methods of such men like Kellogg
and others, dragge I the p!lrty dtm
inant into disgrace, and it was
righteously routed from office by
an aroused and indignant people.
The distasteful affiliations and
shameful conduct of Kellogg and
his intimates, left a bad taste in
the mouths of the people, and for
years after Kellogg's enforced re
tirement from office, honorable and
intelligent men considered it dis
graceful for anyone to entertain
even the faintest opinion favorable
to Republicanism. When asked
for an explanation ot such seem
ing bigotry and fanaticism,
I HE ACTS AND METHODS OF KEL
LOGG & CO., WERE AT ONCE
CITED,
and thus it was that the chances of
Republicanism in a State where
the inhabitants are essentially Re
publicans, were almost irreparably
:nod irre trievably rumined.
However, during term after term
of the past twenty years in which
they have been the rulers of the
State, the Democrats have satisfac
torily and conclusively proven and
demonstrated that their leaders are
even worse office-holding and blood
sucking vampires than the Repub
lican rulers ever dared to be, and
history is now prepared to repeat
itself insofar as an aroused and in
dignant people being ready to rise
up their wrath to overthrow and
drive such unscrupulous and con
scienceless scoundrels from office
is concerned. Both parties have,
therefore, been tried in office and
were found woefully warn'ing, and
now the people have determined
TO HAVE As THEIR RULENS ONLY
EN OF IrTErGRITY,
no mnatter what their party princi
ples or creed may be.
The travesty on this pretended
party fealty is made more appa
rent when one beholds such shin
ing lights of the Democracy -
Fpster aad Fitzpatrick toying and
scbeming with such disgraced Be
Spubb u Kellogg and Cage.
B of them are reputedly and
aeousely corrupt; still Foster, un
der the insidious pretense of en
deavoring to secure for the people
of this State an honest and inor
rpptible government has uaques
tionably combined with them to
insure his being perpetmted mn of
fce. Men like Kellosgg ad Cage
are not built on the plas of those
who tgive up somethi for nothing,
sad therefore it is safe to assume
that for whatever strength they
foolishly ezpect to be able to ac
cord the Demorats, they have st
isaetory semurnmcem of being re
momsrated.
TIn would Mr. Foster place the
mterig wedge that mnght eventu

smindrels reganltn a foothold in

I hereby request the People's par
ty in each parish in this State w
where the party is organized, to fr

pose of assisting and becoming a in
part of the committee of seven al- ar
ready appointed from the State di
Central Committee, said full com- fo
mittee to have charge of the State er
campaign in detail, in every parish a
until the election in April is over, th
when these additional members cis
will be relieved. tr
The best workers in the respect- p
ive parishes should be selected, and a
they should be elected at once by fo
the parish executive committees, el'
or by mass meetings.
The first meeting of this State
Campaign Committee will be held
at Alexandria. La., on Monday,
Feb. 24th mat., (to map out our s

that dinner was ready in the dining wi

that he must pay $1 for his dinner.

Of

i erniient, as enunci:ated by \V:tash
a inl!ton. ,Jeffterson and ,Jacksion, and
h- em!bodie.l in our Natitonal !,atforLn,
tand I we uphold the rwindip le em
Sbodied in the immortal declaration
rs that this should be "'a Government
of the lT)eoIple, by the lpeople and
for the )eople."'
2 And esplc''ially do we de
mn nand the free and unlimited c tin
ar re of both gold and silver. at the
ratio of 16 to 1, with etl'i:Il delt
lpaying power as primary mlonety,
and a full legal tender mmnettry
s- system for the ipeople of the Unit
Sedl States, without c:tsultini any
Il foreign nation or money syndicate.
3. We demand for Louisiana
industries equal protection to that
Io afforded the industries of other
States. An American, not a Brit
ish system of conummrcial laws,
iC that no discrimination against our
' agricultural ant,1 industrial classes
may be inad".
4. We favor a just and liberal
system of public schools for thel
Sbenefit of all classes of our people,
1e and we deplore the fact that for
many years the management of
r- our public seho º1 system has been
0so defective that the party now in
is power seeks to disfranchise a large
number of our citizens on the
a grounds of ignorance.
5. We denounce the disgrace
ful and infamous election frauds
which have prevailed in Louisiana,
and we demand and are determin
ed to have a perfectly honest and
fair election, at which each citizen
qualified to vote, shall cast his b:al
lot freely and secretly, and the
vote shall be fairly counted as they
y are actually cast. This is tie su
Slpreme issue in this campaign, and
- in its success the honor, manhood
' anti prosperity of Louisiana are
' involved. The foul and loathsonr,
0 methods which have brought the
t ballot box stuffer to the front, and
. placed him in power in Louisiana,
must, in the name of liberty, jus
tice, morality and common decen
cy, be suppressed.
3 6. We oppose and denounce the
proposed suffrageamendment, con
cocted by political schemers, not to
purify and elevate the ballot box
but to subserve their selfish pur
poses by providing contradictory
te qualifications, to suddenly disfran
.. chise large masses of worthy citi
zens, by deluding the people with
promises of changes in the next
r- Legislature. We denounce the
te whole amendment as a vicious
:o fraud which proposes measures and
methods that are un-American and
destructive of free institutions.
7. We favor the utmost econo
my of expenditures, in State, city
1- and parish, and pledge our candi
c dates to a strict and impartial en
I. forcement of all laws, and the pres
:e ervation and promotion of every
interest in Louisiana, whose wel
b fare is bioader and more sacred
, than party lines or partisan poli
s cies ; and we invite and urge the
true men and honest citizens of
Louisiana, without regard to past
t- party affiliations to join with us in
d a noble, patriotic and powerful ef
y fort to relieve our people and to
elevate the standard of politics
' and public morality in our beloved
