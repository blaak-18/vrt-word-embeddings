Children Usefutal.
Street-cleaning by children seems
like a novel philanthropy; but it is
one that exists in fact in both New
York and Brooklyn. Col. Waring was
the first to invoke the aid of the little
ones for cleaning the streets, and his
plan has been adopted by the Woman's
Health Protective association of Brook
lyn. The street is the playground of
the children of the poor, and their
nursery as well. To show them the
beauty and the necessity of keeping
things in order is to beget in them a
feeling of local pride about their
especial neighborhood and a desire to
improve it. They are taught not to
scatter the contents of ash-barrels and
and refuse boxes, but to pick up from
the streets the fruit skins, papers and
tins carelessly scattered by their indif
ferent elders. In Brooklyn the child
ren are asked to form themselves into
a league, and to sign a paper declaring
their desire to aid in keeping the
streets in order. The dues are 6 cents
a year, and the reward aside from phil
anthropic satisfaction, is a pretty badge
of membership. Such practical train
ing in good citizenship could be intro
duce with good effect in every commu
nity.
A Good Scheme.
Some one has suggested that the
idea, now under consideration at
Washington, to utilize the mail sys
tem as a means of circulating the
weather prognostications will, If adopt
ed, strike another blow at letter writing.
It is proposed to have the weather bu
reau telegraph its bulletins to thepost
office twice a day, so that they may be
inserted in the stamp that is marked
on the back of every envelope. By
this device a man can tell what the
weather was in the town where the let
ter was mailed and what the wheather
bureau guesssed it would be for the
twenty-four hours following. Many
letter writers now fill several lines of
note paper with a description of the
weather that they are "enjoying."
Not frequently this proves to be the
only information of interest, and a
postofficial believes that if this depart
ment furnished this news on the en
velope it would, in some cases, make
an enclosure superflrous.

GOLD CONSPIRACY.
INSTANCES WHERE GOVERN
MENT INTERVENED.
Facts That Preve the Cleveltad Admin
latratlon to Hse "Hand Ia Glove" with
the Wall Street Conspiratora-Treasoa
Stalks Abroad.
It has frequently been charged on
good authority, and has never been suc
cessfully denied, that the panic of 1893
was a bankers' panic. That the banks
did precipitate the panic there is but
little dou!,t. That Cleveland and Car
lisle were co-conspirators is perfectly
clear.
Tha object of this conspiracy was:
1. To repeal the Sherman law.
2. To secure the issue of bonds.
2. To destroy the greenback and
grunt the banks the privilege of issuing
all the paper money. The tracts rf the
conspirators are as plain as daylight.
On March 11, 1893, seven days after
Grover Cleveland took the oath of office,
in an Interview with a Times-Star re
porter, he said:
"No, I will not call an extra session
of congress. My only 6bject in con
vening that body would be to repeal the
silver purchasing act, and that can not
be effected this year. It is my opinion
that we shall experience close times in
money matters during the year, and
when congress gets together next De
cember it will be more reasonable, more
tractable. It sometimes takes hard
times to bring a people to realize their
condition. When the squeeze comes
the men who stand in the way of legis
lation to preserve public confidence will
lose sight of local theories and senti
ment and will be willing to join the ma
jority and general sentiment of those
who know best what should be done.
I propose to give the country an object
lesson."
Mark the words: "Those who know
best what should be done." On April 27,
following, the New York Sun, a leading
democrati- paper in the east, said:
"Secretary Carlisle this evening met
a number of bankers at the residence of
George L Williams, president of the
Chemical bank. The conference lasted
over an hour. There was the utmost
good feeling displayed. * *"
President Cleveland's advisers have
told him that the only way to Induce
the western and southwestern congress
men and senators to consent to a -epeal
of the SI erman act is to demonstrate to
their constituents that they are losing
every day this law remains in effect.
This work in that direction has been
started by a number of the bankers in
the solid communities of the east. They
are daily refusing credits to the south,
southwest and west. Thle Chicago
banks, it is said, are carry ng out the
same line of policy. Secretary Car
lisle, in his talk with the bankers, made
his stand very clear. It is to be heroic
treatment all the way through of the
Sherman law, and possibly by the next
session of congress and silver-mine
owners and adherents of silver In the
senate and house will be ready to con
sent to a repeal of the law. The bank
presidents, replying to Secretary Car
lisle, cordially informed him that they
would be ready at all times to co-oper
ate with him. Everybody shook hands
and there was harmony all round.
There was perhaps no organized con
spiracy against the west in the great fi
nancial centers of the east, but there was
a general understanding all along the
line that the west should be forced Into
line to help the east accomplish what It
had so long desired. * * * Polities
and finance were combinedl in the
scheme. The great money powers of
*he east had secured the election of
Mr. Cleveland. They first spent a large
sum to secure his nomination, and sec
nnd, a much larger sum to spcure his
election. They knew he was in full
sympathy with their views and they felt
that now, if ever, they must make the
fight for gold monometallisxn. Know
ing that Cleveland was heartily with
them, they desired to create such pub
lie sentiment as would make his :ri
umph with congress easy. First. they
were to press the west for a settlement
of Indebtedness,. and next they were :o
start the scare over the export of gold.
The movement in gold began early in
the year. It was undoubtedly acceler
ated, and every effort made to magnify
its Importance by New York financiers.
The.telegraph wires were daily loaded
not merely with the various amounts
that were going abroad, but with Inter
views with New York men as to what
the effects would be and as to what was
the cause, etc."
Now, Isan't that rich reading?.
Just read It over again, and mark
fow well the plot has been carried out
But it was not necessary to walt for
the meeting of the next congress. The
gold power had things well in hand.
In June they discovered that a bill to
repeal the Sherman law could be passed
and they had Cleveland to call an extra
session of congress to convene August 7.
He issued the proclamation on the
8Oth of June.
In his message he recommended tho
rspe.al of the silver purchasing clause
of the Sherman law and that "other
legislative aetio may put beyond all
doeubt or mistake the lntentleon a abe!
Sty ofl the goveranmet to fUlil1 it pe
aalia tlo.m_ a in moey wariver
ally recognized by an %lviYse* ceua
tries."
The bill was repealed.
But the bankers kept up their raie
on the treasury.
Then came an Issue of $50,000,000 in
bonds.
Still the bankers raided the gold re
serve.
Then came another issue of $50,000,.
000 in bonds.
But still the bankers kept coming.
They wanted more bonds.
And Cleveland and Carlisle issued
$62,000,000 more.
They sold these to the bankers for
$10.000.000 less than their actual market
value.
But this did not satisfy the bankers.
In consideration of the $10,000,000
bribe, they agreed to keep their hands
off the treasury for seven months-to
October, 1895.
When that time expired they again
raided the gold reserve, and In the
February following (1896) Cleveland
and Carlisle issued $100,000,000 more
bonds.
This was all a part of the conspiracy.
The next step is the destruction of
the greenback.
Cleveland and Carlisle have already
recommended that, and are constantly
giving the country object lessons about
the "endless chain" which depletes the
gold reserve.
Now, if Cleveland and Carlisle were
patriotic, what would be the proper
thing to do?
The law says the notes which the
bankers present at the treasury, for
which they demand gold, can be paid In
coin.
Let the secretary pay in silver rather
than deplete the gold reserve and the
raids would cease at once.
This same scheme of raiding the
treasury was attempted in Mr. Cleve
land's first administration, when Dan
teT Manning was secretary of the treas
ury. Mr. Manning went to New York
and called the gold raiders together and
gave them this plain democratic talk:
"Gentlemen: The treasury is willing
to furnish gold for any legitimate de
mand. but if you attempt to draw upon
the treasury gold after to-day as you
are now doing. for hoarding or specula
tion. I shall adopt an effective remedy
for the protection of the government's
reserve. We have a cash balance of
over $15n.0000000. Not one of you
doubts for a moment the ability apd
purpose of the government to maintali
specie payment. But if you continue
to withdraw gold T shall at once order
that you be paid 10 per cent in silver
coin the first day, the second day you
will be paid 20 per cent in silver, and
the third day 30 per cent, and so on
until one-half is nasd you in silver."
"But," exclaimed the astonished
bankers. "this is in violation of the
implied obligation that the government
will pay in gold."
"Make no mistake about that, gen
tlemen." replied Mr. Manning, "the law
says 'coin,' and the treasury will exer
cise its undoubted prerogative."
That put a stop to the gold raiding.
In 1868. when Fisk and Gould cor
nered the gold market, and caused such
an extensive stringency in money that
s panic was precipitated, the govern
ment stepped in and threatened to issue
$50,000,000 additional currency if the
conspira'ors did not let up.
That threat broke the panic. In 1873,
during the great panic of that year, the
government threatened to buy $40,000.
000 of its bonds, releasing from the
treasury that amount of money for eft
culation if the bankers did not cease
their operations against the public in
terests.
That threat brought them to time.
But what does Cleveland do?
lie puts out bonds and takes the
money in from circulation, only aggra
vating the situation.
If ever a president deserved Impeach
ment he does.
But both old parties have supported
him in his policy, and both are equally
gullty with him In this foul conspiracy.
W. 8. MORGAN.
The People May Iaterfere.
Here is a peculiar feature of modern
politics. for the unregenerated of both
or parties to study. In 1892 the ex
pert politicians of the republican party
conceded the presidency to the demo
crats long before the campaign opened.
In this year of our Lord the expert
d.'mocratic politicians already concede
the presidency to the republicans.
The democrats who put up the
money to run campaigns, the rich man
ufacturers, the railroad owners, and all
tbhe "princes" of the democratic party
are willing to concede the presidency
to the republicans this year. Of course
they want their own party to make a
hot campaign; it must do that or it will
die of ennui. They are willing ti put
up money for both sides. If necessary:
to keep up the mock fight between the
twin parties; then, if the people remain
as stupid as they have been, ia 1900
the republicans may let the de'ocrata
win again.
But there comes a time when thed
beat laid plans fail; when confidener
games are exposed; when forbearance
ceases to be a virtue; when dream
stances force people to rie in a move,
meant of selfl-deas. And who knows
but that time Is very near at bhandt It
is at least ime to hope.-TopeLkn A
