Health
Built on the solid foundation of pure,
healthy blood is real and lasting. As
long as you have rich red blood you will
have no sickness.
SWhen you allow your blood to become
thin, depleted, robbed of the little red
corpuscles which indicate its quality,
you will become tired, worn out, lose
your appetite and strength and disease
will soon have you in its grasp.

l. Expected.
rl "That's all right about them British.
era," said a long-legged western man tc
Id a group of reporters, one of whom had
. told a story of how an Englishman had
' been fooled by some Americans on a
train in the far west by a cry of train
e robbers.
"Yes, but they don't like the robber
business a little bit," asserted the re
porter.
"I reckon not." admitted the west
erner, doggedly. "Leastways, after what
I seen and felt I should say there was
one, anyways, that didn't like it over
a ly."
"What did you do? Scare him out of
a year's growth?"
e "Well, no," was the hesitating an
swer, "I reckon it wuzn't quite as much
as that."
t "Tell us about it," put in the impa
h tient listener.
"It was this a-way," said the western
er, in a tone of semi-sadness. "There
was about a dozen of us fellers goin'
through Texas in a sleepin' car, and
j the only stranger in the lot was a strap
d pin' big Englishman, with a voice on
him like a bass drum. We got him out
in the smoker, and it wasn't mor'n
eighteen minutes till we was loadin'
him up to the neck with stories of train
* robbers and that sort of thing. At first
he kinder quieted down a bit, because
we didn't tell no kind of yarns but blood
curdlers, but it wasn't long till he had
his second wind, and purty soon he
was braggin' what he'd do if robbers
a happened to stop any train he was on
LI "That's jist where we wanted him at,
and it wasn't long till we had the job
e put up with the conductor and the rest
d of the gang to stop the train and skeer
that Britisher plumb to death and back
e ag'in. It was about 11 o'clock at night,
e I reckon, in a mighty lonesome place,
when the train came to a stop and we
i, heard a shot outside. That was a sign
for me, and I jumped up and yelled
'robbers.' So did the other fellows, ex
cept two that somehow wasn't around.
The next minute a big chap with his
L face masked stepped in where we was
and stuck his gun right at us. I throwed
y up my hands and so did the others, and
we begged the Britisher not to kill any
body, but do like we done. He was
meeker'n a lamb, and put his paws up
like a baby.
"Then another masked man took the
place of the first one, while he went
through us for our valuables, which we
handed out, all but the Britisher. I
never knowed jist how it happened at
this p'int, but the first thing I knowed
the Britisher let his two fists go, and
the two masked men went down in a
pile, and on the next lick I jined 'em
with another feller on top of me, and
the dern Britisher sat fiat down on the
accumulation and called for the rest of
the gang. Leastwise that was what I
afterwards heard he said, fer I didn't
know anything fer two hours, and we
had to git a doctor for the first two he
hit. I thought a mule kicked me, and
they told me afterwards they thought
lightnin' had struck the train."
"How did he get onto your scheme?"
inquired the reporter.
"Derned if we could ever find out.
I guess he didn't git on; fist kinder sus
picioned and took the chances. He had
all the advantage, fer we couldn't shoot
him, and he didn't give us time to do
any sluggin'."
"How did it finally come out?"
"Oh, fine. When we got to the next
big town we paid for a banquet in his
honor, and before daylight we had
cleaned him out of about $3,500 in a
quiet little game of draw upstairs."

dreaded. Each timie I went out 1 treu mbled
when I camre near the ctar tracks, for nmy
pain at tiomes was so severe that I was
obliged to stand Ilr:e .tly still no matter

rigid, unable to lnove hand or fout wbhie a

tunately it was stoppetl before it struck me
but the dread of it all lastedl as long as my
pain. for I never knew when crossing the

ground in my agony and be crushed to
death. My anxiety to get well grew apace
and I had about given ilu in de'pair when I
n saw in the "Evening News" one day, an
t advertisement of l)r. Williams' link Pills.
Here was something I hadu't tried before
I and I lost no time in getting to the nearest
d drug store. There 1 paid fifty cents for a
d box of these truly wonderful, health restor
ing pills. Before I had finished taking half
of the pills I began to feel relieved; the
' pains in my hips gradually disappeared and
L for the first time in many days I felt as if
there was some hope. I continued to take
the pills and the more I took, the better I
b felt. I finished one box, got another and
it now, having taken only a few of the second
fifty cents worth, I am free from all pain
and as happy as the day is long. Since I
began to take Dr. Williams' Pink Pills I
t, have gained thirty pounds and now when I
cross the car traces I don't care if there is
a dozen vehicles near by. It is a great re
lief, I assure you, and suffering humanity

talking about. 1 speak from experience."
Dr. Williams' Pina Pills contain, in a

to give new life and richness to the blood

also a specific for troubles peculiar to fe

from mental worry, overwork or excesses

The French have the best manners:
and the best cooks in the world, and
it is worthy of note that M. Fure
tieres is a firm supporter of Dr. Koch
on the question of soups. Dr. Koch
never takes his soup till after the
rest of the dinner has been eaten.
It is unquestionably a mistake to fill
the stomach with soup at the begin
ning of a meal. The origin of this
company is purely French. It was
the habit of the reduced aristocracy
to fill their guests with soup in order
to diminish the consumption of more
costly articles of food. Soup after
I the roast or game is the proper thing
now. By that time there is no desire
to partake of it. What was encour-<
aged by the poor but proud people of
France is stuck to by the American
landlord who is running his boarding
house on the American plan. Soup is
to be the stomach's dessert, and not
its flood and blockade.

caused by shoes overheated by too
hard rubbing by the bootblack. Three
weeks ago he purchased a pair of con
gress gaiters. They were somewhat
light. In order to make the leather
soft he freely applied kerosene, then
adjusted the shoes and had them
shined. The morning was hot and
the bootblack worked long and hard
to produce a fine luster. Later in the
day his feet pained him, and upon
taking off his shoes he found that hisi
feet were swollen and the skin in
flamed. The next morning he found
his feet swollen to frightful propor
tions, and a physician ascertained
that he was suffering from blood pois
oning. A man with a swelled head
may have his hat brushed; but if:
there is anything the matter with his
feet he should not have his shoes:

Are Aead of U.
As a nation the French are in ad
vance of us in their application of the
chemistry of food. Th'eir little school
children may be seen daily enjoying*
a lunrciron of a piece of bread or a
little rall or croissant with a bar of
plain chocolate--not creams-and
nothing is more nourishing for them;'
while French, Italians, and Spaniards
alike dip bread into their morning
cup of chocolate. The fact is that
chocolate, like bread itself, requires
for its assimilation the chemical ac
tion produced by mastication, i. e.,
the saliva of the mouth as well as the
action of the stomach. Thus choco
late eaten can be digested by those
to whom acup quickly drunk is poison.

The origin of the polka is not gen
erally known, the inventor of the
dance having been a young Bohemian
girl named Hanicr.ka Selezka. She
was a blooming young peasant maiden
and the best dancer in the village of
Costelec, on the river Elbe. and used
to perform solo dances of her own in
vention at the various village festivi
ties. It was in the year 1830. at a
farmhouse, that the assembled guests
asked her to dance a solo, and she
said: *"I will show you something
quite new," and to the music of her
own singing she danced the polka
step, though with more elaboration
than it is now performed. The dance
became so popular that it was later
made a national dance, and Haniczka
named it pulku, as she said it was
danced in short steps; from pulKu
came polku, and tinally polka, the
dance three years later, in 133.; bc
coming popular in Prague, and in
~839 it was already danced at the
Vienna bails, and one year later be
came the most popular dance in 'Pari,.
