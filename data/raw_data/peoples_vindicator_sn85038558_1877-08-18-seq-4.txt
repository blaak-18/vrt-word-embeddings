Parker, brother-in-law to Ben Ilot
ler, holds the Poest Ofllice fort in New
Orleans resolutely against all cons u
ci's, and was among thie first to tele- dis
graph to Hayes an effusive endorse- e
entet of his policy. Key, who signs stn
himself Postmraster-Geeral, thinks pie
this a good reason for his retention,
but he has to defer to Tynet's judg-r
ment and wislhes, and Tyner moves hai
like a jack in the box, when Senator eim
IMorton touches the spring. Mvan- inst
time Ben Butler prays hard for re- "
form in the civil service, and offers
up his waywaid nephew as a propiti
atron on the altar of his country.
