.F ENEWRL
Every year increases thie populari
ty of this valuable Hair Preparation;
which is due to merit alone. We
can assure.our old patrons that it is
kept fillly up to its high standard;
and it is the only reliable and perfect
ed reparation for restoring GRAY
on I ADED HAIR to its youthulfl color,
making it soft, lustrous, and silken.
The scalp, by its use, becomes white
and clean. It removes all eruptions
and dandruff, and, by its tonic prop
erties, prevents the hair from fulling
out, as it stimulates and nourishes
the hair-glands. By its use, the hair
grows thicker and stronger. In
baldness, it restores the capillary
glands to their normal vigor, and
will create a new growth, except in
extreme old age. It is the most eco
nomical HAIR DRESSING ever used,
as it requires fewer applications,
and gives the hair a splendid, glossy
appearance. A. A. Hayes, M.D.,
State Assayer of Massachusetts, says,
"The constituents are pure, and care
fiully selected for excellent quality;
and I consider it the BEST PIREPA
RATIO tfor its intended purposes."
Sold by all Druggists, and Dealers in Medicines.
Price One Dollar.
Buckingham's Dye.
FOR THE WHISKERS.
As our Renewer in many cases
requires too long a time, and too
much care, to restore gray or faded
Whiskers, we have prepared this
dye, in one preparation; which will
quickly and effectually accomplish
this result. It is easily applied,
and produces a color which will
neither rub nor wash off. Sold by
all Druggists. Price Fifty Cents.

Cherry Pectoral,
For Diseases of the Phroat and Lunge,
sech as Conhas, Colds, Whoopilg.
Cough,.Bronohitia, Asthma,
and Consumption.
Among the grent
di.coveris of muod
ern science, few ar:'e
of more re;al value
to mankind than
this effectual rem
edv for all diseases
of the Throat and
Lungs. A vast tri
al of its virtues
throughout this andi
ether countries, has
shown that it does
surely and effectually control them. The tes
tilto of ows at oitisaa.., of all oluasca, cs.
tablishes the fact, that CIIEtnY ' PECaRA,t
will and does relieve and cure the afflicting
disorders of the Throat and Lungs beyond any
other medicine. The most dangerous alaee
tions of the Pulmonary Organs yield to its
power; and cases of Consumption, cured
by this preparation, are publicly known, so
remarkable as hardly to be believed, were
they not proven beyond dispute. As a rem
edy it is adequate, on which the public may
re!yfor full protection. By enring Coughs,
the forermners of more serious disease, it
saves unnumbered lives, and an amount of
sufering not to be computed. It challenges
trial, and convinces the most sceptical.
Every faminily should keep it on hand as a
protection aninst the early and unperceived
attacks of Pulmnonary AITections, which are
easily met at first, bui which become incura
ble, and too often fatal, if neglected. Tender
lungs need this defence; and it is unwise to
be without it As a safegnard to children,
amid the distressing diseases which beset the
Throat and Chest of childhood, CIIERRY
PEcronAL is invaluable; for, by its timely
use, multitudes are rescued from premature
graves, and saved to the love and affection
centred on them. It acts speedily and surely
against ordlinary colds, securing sound and
health-restoring sleep. No one will suffer
troublesome Influenza and painful Bron
chilia, when they know how easily they can
be cured.
Originally thie product of long, laborious,
and ssccessful chemical investigation, no cost
or toil is spared in making every botle in the
utmost possible perfection. It may be confi
dentlv relied upon as possesslng aIll the vir
tues it has ever exhibited, and capahle of
producing cures as memorable mas the greatest
it has ever ecffeted.

Tihere is no cathartic lor the purpose
equal to DR. J. W tALKER 's VINEGAR

the darik-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy tiuc

intractable ea.es.
For Inflammatory and Chronic

whatever name or nature, are literally
dug up and carried out of the system in a
short time by the use of these Bitters.
Pin, Tape, and other Worms,
lurking in the system of so many thou
sands, .are effectually destroyed andi re
moved. Ko hsystem of medicine, no ver

that improvement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
whenever you find its impurities bursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores; cleanse it when you find it ob.
structed and sluggish in the veins; cleanse
it when it is foul; your feelings will tell
you when. Keep the blod pure, and the
health of the system will follow.
