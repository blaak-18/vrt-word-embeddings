to the world not a dissolving Confed
eracy, but a lasting compact of free
States under a constitution which
was a model chart with a homogene
ous population, knit together by
common sufferings and glories and
held together by common interest.
What was permitted to no man to
know of such a people’s destiny let
no man now lay down for us as the
inevitable. * * *

“MARCHING THROUGH GEORGIA”
REVISED.
By S. Grady.
1.
Let us get together, boys, and own
the truth at last,
For the Carpet-Bagger reign is now
forever past;
And we know you’ve whipped your
selves, and can but stand aghast,
Since you went marching through
Georgia.
Chorus:
Hurrah! hurrah! the right doth now
prevail;
Hurrah! hurrah! we ne’er expect to
fail,
For we’ve pulled our ship of state in
from the awful gale,
We are now reigning in Georgia.
2.
Sherman felt like Nero, who looked
on burning Rome
As he rode through villages, and
burned the people’s homes.
As he frightened ladies, and made
little children groan
While they went marching through
Georgia.
(Chorus)
3.
Then he smelled the odor of the ne
groes in his ■wake,
Whom he taught their only friends
they should forever hate.
For he meant that savages the Gov
ernment should take
Since he went marching through
Georgia
(Chorus)
4.
How a real Caucasian could such a
scheme devise,
Fore’er will be the mystery as gen
erations rise;
Yet they crowed like bantams, their
own flesh and blood despised
While they went marching through
Georgia.
(Chorus)
5.
But they’ll help to eat the hash they
for us did prepare
For they're now entangled in the
galling negro snare;
Sambo's now a menace to their
homes and daughters fair,
'Cause they went marching through
Georgia.
(Chorus)
6.
But we’ll not forsake them when the
awful curse they feel
l or we now await the war amend
ments to repeal
For we’re Anglo-Saxon, and our
greatness we’ll reveal,
Though they went marching through
Georgia.
Leary, Georgia.
TRIBUTE FROM A VETERAN.
My Dear Brother Watson: —I am
going to try to write you a few lines
and 1 would to God I could express
to you my feelings in words but I
can not, but I know I am not de
ceived in you. If there is a man liv
ing that needs and deserves the sym
pathies of the common people I am
sure it is you, and as I have no
means to help you in your warfare
with the great evils that exist and so
i ch affect the vital interest of the
common or poor people you shall
l ave my prayers that you may be
spared many years yet to write, work
and see the good effects of your ar-
duous labors. You seem to love your
enemies and do good to them that
despitefully use and abuse you, and
I believe God will yet abundantly
bless you, for no one that will lay
down all prejudice and love for
mammon can deny your honesty and
truthfulness. Now may your life and
writings be the beacon star that shall
lead the common people of this grand
America to yet realize and enjoy the
freedom that our Washington, Jack
son and Jefferson fought and con
tended for in years gone by. Will
you kindly accept this from one that
so much loves you. God bless you
and yours is the desire of an old
Confederate veteran.

CORRECTS MRS. OTTLEY AS TO
AMOS RUCKER.
Dear Sir: —I notice in your repro
duction of the Uncle Remus article
relating to Amos Rucker it is claimed
he was a member of the Forty-third
Georgia regiment. That, is a mis
take; he was a cook in Company C
o l ' the Sixty-third Georgia regiment,
and it was the roll of that company
through the calling of which he be
came famous.
Very respectfully,
C. F. PARKER.
Atlanta, Georgia.
