one who has no drill best put in his w
seeds? ja
Even in such a simple matter as
lanting seeds in straight rows thre m,
are slow, laborious ways; and there is bc
at least one comparatively rapid and as
sunccessful way, somewhat troublesome A
to describe, but very easy to execute to
Swhen once learned, in
To begin with, if you have not a tb
"true eye," or if you are a woman and
I awkward, you want a stout string- kh
wool twine is best-as long as your to
Srows. Also two or more stakes and a to
stick cut just the length you want the tr
rows apart. Stretch the string be
tween the two stakes where you want el
the first row to be. If the row is hi
long, put the extra stakes on the line in
to keep it exactly in place.
Next take a hoe. The usual way en
from this point on is to pick or dig a as
groove with one corner of the hoe, T
using it as in Fig: 1, and making 8 to 6 uk
inches of trench at a stroke. This is bi
slow work, generally makes a groove
crooked and uneaven in depth, and,
worst of all, if the ground is not per
fotly loose tand mellow the bottom of
tk li
the trench, where the seeds way to
spromt, is liable to be more or less hard
and cov ipncte

as in Fig. . A is the liad of direction
r of the trench. C is the position of the P
operator. At D is shown the manner
of using the hoe. The handle of the u
hoe during the work is always in line d'
h with A B. Now try it and use the hoe a
as in Fig. 2. Instead of using only the e
corner point of the hoe use the end
edge as shown at D. Instead of stand
ing in front of the hoe as it moves in
the direction A B, stand to one side of
AB, one foot at EandoneatC. DE
is two feet, and E C is two feet or more.
The hoe as shown is at the end of a
stroke, and D E is perpendicnlar to A B.
The hoe handle, D I, is grasped at i F,
(G and F being about two feet apart),
and is held well away from you. The
angle which D I makes with A B-is
such that as youn look down upon the
handle it covers the line D C on the
ground; i. e.. crosses the point of your
right toot, and makes an angle of 49
degrees with A B. Instead of picking
SFIG .
and digging, make a long, sweeping
stroke, sharp and quick, 18 to 24 inches,
according to your strength and skill
The whole thing would be far easier
to learn from actual sight. If done
right the result will be a straight,
clean groove of the desired depth, with
fine, mellow dirt in the bottom. The
blade of the hoe will throw the dirt
like a plow in rapid motion.
Then, for very fine seeds, such as
L onion, etc., take an inch board about
five feet long, four to six inches wide,
and shape it as in Fig. 8. Slide this
along the bottom of the groove. This
secures perfect straightness, perfect
evenness in depth, and the finest dirt
in bottom of groove. The plants can
thus be weeded and tilled even before
ef they are up. Next move the line and
Sstakes the proper distance until enough
a grooves are made. Then drop the
peas, beans, seeds, etc., and cover.
SIn covering, use the hoe in much the
same way as in grooving. However, if
- the ground is lumpy use care in get
ting only fine dirt on the seeds. Also
be particular to cover to the proper
depth.
To distribute very fine seeds in the
grooves, mix them thoroughly with
dry sand, put all in a bottle, put
a quill in the cork, and distribute
along the trench. The amount of seed
per rod or per foot of row can be cal
culated, and the distribution regulated
accordingly.
This method saves two-thirds of the
time and does better work. If anyone
knows a better way let's hear it.--An
ton Leister, in Ohio Farmer.
An Otio otad ehbme.
A novel and extremely interesting
experiment is soon to be tried in Ohio.
It is a new departure in road improve
ment, which is claimed by its author
to have points of marked superiority
over the building of macadamized
roads. The plan is to extend the elec
tric railway tracks from cities and
towns into the surrounding country,
and .to constract the roqads in such a
way that they can be used for wagons
and carriages drawn by horses as well
aS by ears. Of course there will be a
great s~aving in horse power wherever
such roads are used, since far heavier
loadti ean be drawn -on steel tracks

f A PROFITABLE STUDY.
Southern University Now Has a Cearse
In omds Construction.
M With all respect for the generalia
e policy of our educational institutions, I
fit is proper to say that much is taught
which has not the practical value of
e some other branches which are taught
at present only in the rough school of
experience.
d It is a very fine thing for a young
lady to understand music and paint
ing, it is even desirable that she be
able to speak several languages (so
long as English is one of them), but
when that young lady finds herself the
wife of a common, everyday, human
man, and the mother of several healthy
children she may regret that it is im
possible to swap culture for crackers.
" o be able to translate Latin into
1e English is good if the translator can
s also translate flour into bread. If but
eone of the accomplishments is to be had
1e the choice should be easily made.
A person may be rich (in money) but
riches
"g Make pinions for themselves to fly."
The only wealth which neither time
nor fate can change is that which is
stored away in the form of practical
knowledge.
We are glad to notice that much is
-being done in the way of teaching the
rudiments of road building in schools.
"The new south" is beginning to
know that roads are an important fac
tor in the development of any section.
The University of North Carolina
's located at Chapel Hill, is advertising a
L course in road construction under the
direction of Joseph Auxstin Holmes, B.
e `., who is also state geologist, and
1e Thomas Roswell Foust, B. E., in
h st-ructor in mathematics and land sur
veying.
e Road building is fully equal in im
portance to anything taught in
schools, and infinitely more important
as than much which is given greater
Lt prominence.

What the People Must Learn.
It has always seemed to me that if
the people could have forced home to
them two facts: first, that good mac
e adam or gravel roads are, in the long
or run, the cheapest as regards both con
ity struction and maintenance; and seo
oed, that they are inestimably more
no- profitable both in lessening the cost of
d transportation and in improving the
value of property, it would not be long
' before our resetnt wretched and dilap
na idated dirt roeds would be replaaced by
el a fine system of substantial .highways
