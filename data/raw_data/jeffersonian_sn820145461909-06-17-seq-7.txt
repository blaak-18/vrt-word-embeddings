have a quick eye for what is going
on around me, and so I made a study
of every detail that came before me
in that “hell hole,' as George Bell
called it and it is the only appro
priate name. I shudder to think of
the indecency that enthralls the La
dies Department, and at the way
they keep people there through their
villainous devices for mean motives.
My remaining days will be spent
in perplexity unless I am able to solve
the deep mystery that surrounds my
detention there.
I want you to publish this, and let
the world know of this shame to our
-white race. My heart has been
touched on account of the sufferings
of some of the inmates. Some of the
things which occur there are too hor
rible to mention, and yet they are
fresh in my memory.
Very respectfully,
MRS. J. L. BECK.

TENTH DISTRICT REGRETS.
My Dear Sir:—l want to thank
you for the splendid paper you are
giving us, and your editorials alone
are worth double the price of the pa
per. Not that I would try to flatter
you, but the majority of the farming
and laboring people know that you
are the grandest champion of the
poor people that has ever lived. The
old Tenth District will, and I believe
has, regretted that overwhelming,
overcounted majority it gave your
opponent. Thank you for your edi
torials on Foreign Missions.
Yours until death,
G. W. SUDDETH.
Rockmart, Ga., May 29, 1909.
THEY “BORROW” HIS JEFFER
SONIAN, WITHOUT HIS
CONSENT.
The Jeffersonian, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: —I have found lately
that a couple of my papers had been
pulled out of the wrapper and put
back again. That is the way they
used to do with my Missouri World,
and every little while I would have
a paper stolen, and when I would
send for a bundle to give away they
would come with the wrapper ripped
off and tied on with a string, and I
have had lots of mail stolen besides
that. I take the American Citizen,
and I have not received the last two
numbers of that. Please stick the
wrapper on my paper so tight that
nobody can get it off, without tearing
it off, even if it spoils a little good
reading. It is better to lose a little
of it than to lose it all. You may be
sure that the Jeffersonian don’t suit
any Republican thieves. It tells too
much truth. If the damn, cowardly
Americans would get up an enter
tainment that amounted to some
thing I would do my part to get rid
of the thieves in this country. I
hate thieves worse than I hate
snakes, and I hate cowards about as
bad.
With best wishes for the success
of the Jeffersonian and the editor, I
am, Respectfully,
NELSON WICKENS.
Downing, Wis., May 3, 1909.
Answer. — Unfortunately, Mr. Wat
son can’t personally attend to putting
the wrappers on the Jeffersonians,
but if it were possible he would be
glad to fix them so they wouldn’t be
“borrowed” without the subscribers’
consent. There are lots of folks in
the world who read the Jeffersonian
on the sly, and they are mean enough
publicly to claim they wouldn’t look
at a copy, but such is life and we all
have to be patient until we can edu
cate just such people to better things.
PARTY ORGANIZATION.
Much is being said relative to call
ing a conference with the view of
some kind of an organization being
effected. The People’s party has
never had an organization in fact,
and to this fact may be traced all our
weakness. Our custom has been to
call a convention and nominate a
ticket, and then let the campaign
drag along till about three weeks be
fore the election, then try to do
something, and attribute our failure
to the want of “Funds.” No polit
ical movement ever lived as long as
the People’s party has on that kind
of diet.
The People’s party has reached
the parting of the ways, and unless
an organization is set up on a self
sustaining base of action, the left
hand road that leads to obscurity is
open for the procession to the grave
yard. It is a useless waste of time,
energy and money, for the few to
further attempt to keep the appear
ance of party action on the plan here
tofore pursued.
I am at a loss, sometimes, to un
derstand just why the Populists could
never be organized like other parties
are. Every political party, of what
ever name or creed, has an organiza
tion, agitators at work, scattering
their literature, in short doing
something except the Populist.
Not a Populist speaker at work in
the nation, and the reason given is
“Got no funds.” Well, how in the
name of common sense are you going
to get funds unless some system is
devised by which you can raise the
funds? If you don’t try to get the
funds, why do you expect any? and
if you don’t expect any, it must be
because you don’t want any, and if
you don’t want any all you have to
do is to stand “pat” and wait for the
undertaker. Organization is every
thing, without it, we are nothing.
The idea that possessed many that
an organization could be effected by
use of the U. S. mail has proved a
failure, and now the idea with some
seems to be that an organization can
be effected and maintained by our
newspapers, and it too will prove a
howling failure. So far as our press
goes, well and good, but it is depen
dent on the Populists for support, and
then again ninety-nine per cent, that
read our papers are Populists, thus
are we living off the converted, and
adding nothing to the fold byway of
numbers. The press may keep up an
organization, but has the first organ
ization yet to create. The press may
be the result of a public upheaval,
and thus begins with a sentiment of
which it is a creature and as such
must live by the sentiment and when
the sentiment weakens, the press
weakens and staggers and falls, or
else shifts its position for nourish
ment in another direction.
I am at a loss to see our press
lacking discernment in this particu
lar, for, as a matter of fact, there
must first be some reason for a de
sire to read a paper before there is
a sale for it. After a fine address the
speaker hands out a goodly number
of papers, and takes some subscrib
ers, the speech creates the desire to
tsl>a 3effersoniatt
read the paper, and the few sub
scribers make an opening through
which other speakers get into the
town, and it is thus the work is
done. The press is essential, and so
is the speaker; they must go togeth
er, each building up and holding up
the other. Why is it not done?
“Got no funds.” The paper cannot
afford to put out a canvasser, the
readers won’t justify the expense,
and that’s why it is not done. Pre
miums offered to those who send in
a number of subscribers is a disposi
tion to reward those who will make
the effort, but what is everybody’s
business, seems to be nobody’s busi
ness, and this method is too slow at
best for the building up of a great
political party.
Again, as to this premium method,
every Populist lays down and lets the
editor do the work; yes, they sit up,
sometimes, long enough to see how
the editor is making it, and if they
send in one subscriber, and even this
is not often done, they think they
have “knocked the persimmon.”
I am fully persuaded a political
party cannot be either organized by
the use of the U. S. mails or the
newspapers alone, as a means to an
end. Fellow Populists, there is one
thing essential to our existence as a
party, that we are wholly short on,
which is “organization.” There must
be a coming together of the National,
Executive and Central Committees,
if not a general conference, and some
plan of organization agreed upon,
and embodied in a public address,
and sent out to encourage and en
thuse our people.
Again, I am fully persuaded that
when the Populists of the country
see an organization set up, and a de
termined spirit on the part of our
leaders to push right ahead, all the
trouble about funds will at once dis
appear. Our people want to be
cited, they want to know where they
are at, they want to see something
tangible. The body is still here, and
will move when the head wills it,
and not before. It is said a Populist
is too suspicious to be organized; my
answer to this is that Populists have
a right to be suspicious, and our
manner of conducting conventions
and campaigns is the cause of it all.
In order to clear the atmosphere
of suspicion we must remove the
cause that produces it; therefore, an
organization as a result of reorgani
zation must be had before our people
will respond with funds; here, then,
is the key to the situation. Should
you continue to drag along till the
next national election, then call a
nominating convention, I fear you
will find a killing frost on the pump
kin.
I am an old, dyed in the wool Pop
ulist, and a member of the National
Executive Committee of Illinois.
