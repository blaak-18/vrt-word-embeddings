THE WORLD
FOR 1879.
tea SPECIAL OFFER.
rful
Vi THE NEW YORK
F of
fe-, WEEKLY WORLD,
an An Eight-Page Newspaper,
will be seut (posfage perpaid)
From Now Until January 1, 1879
FOR
TEN CENTS.
(t'This Special Offer is made to enable the
Southern people to see for themselves how good
a paper THE WORLD is and how worthy it Is
leeof their esudport.
On 'the let nofMay.1876, th, e ownersbip and
controle of TIIE WORLD passed into the hands
see of the udddrsigned, under whose absolute and
untrammelled directions THE WORLD has
ever since remained and now remains
During the whole of this time THE WORLD
has labored patiently and perseverinugly for the
accomplishment of two objects in politics of
paramount interest to the Southern people.
1. The restoration of Local Self-Government
at the South.
II. A Real Reform of the Civil Service, in
such wise as to destroy the political machines
under the opperation of which it has come to
ri pass that the people are taxee to support politi
cal parties, whereas political parties have no
other reason of being except to lessen the bar
den on the government.
The first of these objects have been triumph
antly accomplished. A'I inteligent Northen
men now admit that all parts of the coumtry
were as deeply interested as the South in seeing
it won. A corrupt end anti-Democratic govern.
meat in the South was a permanent peril to the
e. ascendancy of true American principles in the
Federal Government and therefore to thq pleace
and honor of the whole people.
The second political object for which THE
15l WORLD contends still remains to be fully ach
ieved. The actual Administration began its
career with excellent promises in this diree.
tion of which it is sufficient to say that they
have been as yet only in part redeemed. THE
WORLD for its part will resolutely support any
honest efforts to redeem these promises fully,
by whosoever made, and will as resolutely de.
doance every obstical thrown in the way of re.
deeming them, from whatever quarter
It seems to the undersigned eminently proper
that he should ask the cooperation of the best
by men of the South with THE WORLD in its ef
forts to carry out the policy here outlined. He
believes THE WORLD to be a paper which
Southern citisons and Democrats can recom
mend to Southern readers asan influece worthy
and important to be brought to bear with con
stenoutly increasing power upon our national af.
airs, in the interest of truth, of justice and of
armony among our people of all sections.
It is my desire to keep THE WORLD in a
lively relation witt the best thoughts of the to
South, to the end that the best ideas, wishes
and feelings of the Southern people may be in
clearly and fairly known to the North' the East
and the West. Alike in prtvate and in public
affairs the misunderstanding of men by one an.
other lies at the root of so much evil that the
word itself has come to be a synonym with
quarreling and strife. It was a wise saying of
Lord Elgia, at the time of on6 of our sharpest
disputes with Great Britain, that two intelli.
is gent gentlemen alone on a raft in the Atlantic
with plenary power could adjnst the whole mat
ter honorably in an hour.
THE WCRLD simply asks its friends at the
South to aid it in bringnlg about a complete
meeting of minds on all public questions be
tween the intelligent citizen of all part of the
Union, WILLIAM HENRY HURLBERT.

"Come unto me, all ye who labor
and are heavy laden, and I will give
youl test."
"Be not weary in well-doing for in
dII, time, ye shall reap ifyefaint not."
The departing rays of the October
stl, are shining, bright and golden,
shltlnmeting through the tender rts
set of the trees, as their long shodows
are thrown upon the grass, and glo
rifxying the light particles which float
int the air, till they seem like another
shower of gold. Far up in the west l
tern sky, the rich amber, mets into
mtnethvst and not a cloud fecks its
glot ions depths.
-Nearly nineteen centuries ago, this
samne sun, upon sich an evening it
nay be shone upon the purple hills
of Judea. The feet of the incarnate
Deity trod those heights, and linger
ed among their valleys. He cante in
no royal state, but humble in mien,
and gentle in bearing, wherever men
suffered, his hand was extended to
heal. His words of lofty wisdom 1
reached all hearts, for "hie spake, I
as never man spake". Could the l
eyes of his followers have been open
ed, they would have cried like Elisha,
"my father my father the chariots of I
Israel, and the horsemen thereof," for
Sangels ministered unto him, and their I
shining cohorts were ever around him, I
Ulpon jnst such an evening it may be
the sAn's departing rays gilded te le
declivity of Olivet, where He sat, to I
speak to the nmultitude, whot the t
fame of his wonderful works, and his f
st passing goodness, had brought to I
his feet. f
Far in the distance glittered Gen- t
nesaret. like a gent in its verdant set
ting, wllile hehind sat Jerusalemn, the
hIly. city, like a crown upon the hill. t
IHe had led them away from all its I
sipledulors, its douties anid pinnacles, 9
:the lofty courts of the temple, with
its grand, and royal service of priest, i
IIand Ltevite, its cheruttein, and Sera- 8
phin, its pIrches, with pillars crown- o
edI %i ith "lily work covered with I
go.ld- the long collonades where lt
ta- tnght the doctors of the law, he had t
ug left it all behindr iul, as he desired s
theum to do with ttheitr past lives, and a
led them into a grander temple, whose 1
dome was the heavens, and whose it
royal sacrifice he himself was to be. i1
It must have been a strange and a
varied crowd. "Not many rich, not a
mIany noble." No gilded chariots, no a
shiining armor, no silken drapery h
waited on his footsteps-but the poor,
the sick, the blind, the heart sore, h
and weary, they for whom the earth tI
had no more hope, came to hear his h
woidsof wisdom. There were men P
of all grades and classes-men of dis-.
apointed ambition, broken and tired tI
of the cares of Itfe-publicans, and a
sinners of still deeper dye-women H
sinful and degraded - mothers wear- a
ied with the monotonoous, and often tI
thankless troubles of their daily life- -
chi.dren young in years, but old ca
in sin-hearts which ached and gf
pined for faces which the grave fi
had hidden, and tones which they ti
* could hear no more. Over that 1o
-deep grief there lay, for many of
them the thick gray pall of hopeless- w1
u ness. Although God bad promised is
, them "tihegift of life forevermore" a ar
large class, the Ladducees, denied at
that there was any ressurrection,.so th
that when, they laid their dead away, th
Sthey believed It was to sleep the sleep re
of eternity. Christ was to settle for- pS
qver the question "if a man die, shall di
he live again," for he himself was hi
to be "the first fruit of them which lil
Sslept." p1
Gifted with omniscience, reading at as
a glace aIl these aching human hearts, ph
whtat an infinuite pity must have filled in
h Iis own, he, who came to lay down P'
Ihis liftb for tlhem, when stretching w
forth Ihis arm, he cried, "come unto di
me, all 3Ce who labor and are heavy I
laden, and I will give you rest, I will fu
lead you forth into green pastures th
and by the still waters, I will teach 5
you that the sufferings of this pres. bi
cut life, are not worthy to be com- wl
pared, with the joys which the eter- of
nal Father has laid up for theose whoa a
love him." How like a cooling dew, M
- must these beoign words have fallen bi
Ipon all these hearts, scorched, and ea
htrned by the fiery fever of life! th
They were not to try to make them- ol
selves better, there were to be noet
burtt offerings or sacrifices, but leav- th
ing behind them all the dark and sin. W
ful past, the were to come and lay p
their aburdens at his feet.
19 hundred yearsl What changes, he
what wooderfol events; what myri- th
ads of human lives; what hope and 4
what fears; what crimes and what "t
virttues have been crowded into that ne
Ilong lapse of time ! All has changed, gi
