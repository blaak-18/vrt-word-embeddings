PASTOR ADVISES LET
UP ON KU KLUX KLAN
Owosso, Mich.—Advice to adopt a
Christian attitude toward the Ku Klux
Klan was given by Rev. H. Waite,
pastor of the First Baptist Church
here, when he addressed a big congre
gation le t Sunday night.
“Let me say this, my friends,” the
pastor said, “if the Klan is the bloody
bunch of hoodlums that some repres
ent it to be; if the Klan sets aside law
and despises order; if it seeks to *tir
religious hatred, denying the constitu
tional right of American citizens to
worship God according to the dictate*
of their conscience; if it spells terror
to law-abiding folk and makes the
midnight ring with the cries of its
victims; then, in the name of God,
it should be destroyed root and branch
the sooner the better.
Should Be Judged By Its Fruits
“On the other hand, if these 6,500-
000 men who have banded together
have an unselfish purpose in the pro
tection of America’s right for Amer
icans; the protection of the church,
school and state; if they maintain
American tradition; insist upon loy-
“THE LAW IS
BOOKS, SO
Chief Justice Taft made a plain
speech to Yale men last year that
new Klansmen should know. It was
a speech that should be radioed to
every college chapel in the land.
Stating frankly that although he
himself h§d been opposed to the 18th
amendment before it was adopted,
the issue had been decided against
him, in the regular appointed way,
“the rules of the game of popular
government are that all living under
the government must obey.” He
stated clearly that there isn’t the
slightest chance that the amendment
will be repealed. Some of his em
phatic utterances should be printed
in the school books of the up-to-date
American school boy in the place of
some of the history lessons that tend
neither to inform nor to increase a
child’s sense of right and patriotic
duty. Among the striking state
ments that stand out in this speech,
the following may be remembered and
quoted:
“I have confidence that when the
intelligent, the patriotic, the well-to
do, as well as the plain people, face
the real issue, when they see whither
we are tending in making fun of the
law and its violations, all of which
tends to lead one to support those who
are engaged in violating it, when
they realize that others not so pat
riotic, and who are evil-minded are
only too glad to bring about a demor
alization of all law, as the open vio
lations of the liquor law necessarily
tend to do, then I believe we shall
THE RIGHT OF THE STATE
The state in America has the right
to compel the parent to educate the
child, and the fact that private
schools instead of public schools have
been allowed as a privilege and not
as a right, means that when this
privilege is abused it certainly can
be withdrawn, declared Ford Van
Hosen, deputy grand master, Ma
sonic Grand Lodge of lowa, at its
annual meeting in Sioux City this
month. He said in part:
“In this country the right of Vje
children qf the state to receive at the
hands of the sate an elementary edu
cation is almost as firmly rooted in
our system of government as are the
guarantees of protection to life and
liberty and safety of persons and
property.
“There are now agencies in our
country that attempt to subvert the
rights guaranteed by our laws aifl
constitution, and even the rights of
the parents themselves in dictating
the education of our children by say
ing that ‘education is none of the
state’s business.’ Surely no church
A KANSAS DEFENSE
A wagon passed through Kansas,
says a Missouri paper, bearing the
following inscription:
“Colorado and irrigation, Kansas
and starvation, I’m going to my
wife’s relation, and make no demon
stration.” A Minnesota editor took
up the matter and answered as fol
lows: “They ought to come to Minn
esota—where there is no irrigation
and a man with education can engage
in speculation, bring along his wife’s
relations, have a good time and free
salvation, with no danger of starva
tion. This is worth consideration.”
That made a Kansas editor warm un-
alty to the constitution; uphold the
honor of womanhood; stand for one
language, one school, one flag, and
equal service to all; then I am the
last man in the country to offer de
structive criticism and I would sug
gest that once more we might apply
the teachings of Jesus Christ and
judge the Klan by its fruits. This, in
the last analysis, is the acid test.
Will it stand the test? This I can
not answer. I, like the rest of you,
must aw. it the outcome.”
Continuing, Rev. Mr. Waite saia:
“In the words of some, this country
is going to the dogs. I believe there
is enough character in this country
to hold the ship of state in a steady
course against the evils hinted at in
the discussions throughout the press.
It is the duty of every American to
unselfishly give the best within him
to preserve a grand America for fu
ture generations. He who lives to
serve the race, whether he be Protest
ant, Catholic, Jew or Gentile, rich or
poor, high or low, need have nothing
to fear from any source whatsoever.”

A TRAIL
In Irving Bacheller’ book, “The
Marryers,” there is a bit of clever
satire on American title hunt erf,, blood
worshipers and travel-crazzed wealth
in search of new thrills. TJ.ie gush
ing Mrs. Fraley has a high frequency
-enthusiasm over aipcient European
castles. The philosophic M.r. Socrates
Potter tells her that the {grandest ru
ins in the world are to be found in
the United States, and proceeds to
show a few that are worthy of hon
orable attention. “See America first”
is good sense when it comes to the
wreck of venerable institution®.
As we behold the feeble and fast
waning remnant of the Grand Army
of the Republic it is a suitable time
ito recall some of the particular ru
ins to be found hereabouts. When
Sheridan made his march to the sea,
so complete was the trail of ruin that
it was said if a crow intended to fol
low that route he must carry his pro
visions with him. The gallant citi
zenry of this young naton has some
trails even more honorable than this.
We can point with pride to the ru
ined trail of tyranny. In the clos
ing quarter of the eighteenth century
the forces generated by the leaven of
Christianity did a greater work than
men then living had ever dreamed.
In that heroic time traditions were
ground to powder, and their dust
scattered to the four winds. The
plowshare of revolution ripped up the
cold, fallow ground of society shad
owed by “predestined privilege,” and
into its wintry discontent flowed the
flood of sunlighted healing grace.
That might was right was the creed
of kings, and the baronial castle was
followed by the regal palace. The
palace was supported by the cathe
dral, and a host of props preserved
the ancient lofty structure that over
shadowed the worth of the average
man. Pale and anaemic was his life,
blossomless his branches, and scant
his fruits of happiness. But the old
order changed. A new manhood was
born out of the struggle of right
against might. Tyranny fell like Da
gon from his throne, and in the
wreck the props toppled one after
another. The American revolution was
not merely the success of a colony.
It was the triumph of a cause, and
the winning of a world. Europe to
this hour has no ruins that can com
pare with the ruins of feudalism,
tyranny and so-called divine rights
that are on exhibition from Bunker
Hill to Valley Forge.
A second trail of splendid ruins to
which we can point the newcomer’s
gaze is the ruin of slavery. It seems
strange that the good God should
have allowed this infamous sum of vil
lanies to exist so long. But the
mills of God grind slowly. The grist
may be slow in arriving, but under
the power of God’s giant millstones*,
under which resistance is useless, the
flow is certain. Christ said not a
word about slavery, but having cut
without hands the little stone that
should grind the very mountains to
dust, his invincible crusher has been
doing business to this hour. On that
stone is engraven, “Ye shall know
the truth and the truth shall make
you free.” The force of this princi
ple has been increasing one and it is
pulverizing prejudice and supersti
ton and every form of misappropri
ated privilege, by which intrenched
power gives men less than their God
given right*.
Another ruin is left in the wake of
“the fighting men of seventeen.” We
are not yet able to determine whether
in the effort “to make the world safe
for democracy” the United States
failed to finish the job. Some old
walls were left standing that are a
menace to the progress of the races.
And one of these is the outgrown idea
that hermit isolation is* a proper at
titude on the part of any Christian
nation. When it is remembered that
this nation once forcibly presented
Japan with a brand new open-door
policy, and China with such helpful
suggestions in the same direction, it
is most unbecoming for Uncle Sam to
wrap the mantle of Pharsaic selfish
ness about him and give thanks that
he is not as other nations. With open
doors and open hearts and fraternal
seeds a holy aloofness is more than
unmannerly. It is un-Christian and
unwise.
There are a few more ruins now in
process of perfection which may be
pointed out—the complete ruin of the
liquor traffic here and around the
world; the ruin of an organized white
slavery business which, in spite of the
abridgment of King Alcohol’s privi
leges, still flourishes; and the ruin of
the modern vice of dope and narcotics.
All these give opportunity for a new
crop of heroes.
There is a greatly needed ruin
awaiting an enlightened Christian
conscience—the ruin of snobbery and
semi-caste system which, in spite of
our boasted democracy, prevails to no
small extent in the land of Thomas
Jefferson, Ben Frnaklin, and Abraham
Lincoln. Bobby Burns sang:
“The rank is but the guinea stamp
The man’s the gowd for a’ that.”
While Burns followed the plow and
turned over the daisies, over here
young America was demonstrating in
the greatest object lesson, the very
principle for which he strove in vain.
Wordsworth:
“We must run glittering like a brook
lb the open sunshine, or we are un-

This is idolatry and these we edoTe,

An while he wrote, “plain living
and high thinking” were having the
opportunity of their lives on this
hemisphere, where the humble toilers
from all the earth were working out
the will of God, and planting the
new Jerusalem in Columbia’s happy
land. Yet the things Wordsworth de
plored are blossoming red here and
now. It is almost inevitable that
where wealth accumulates, men decay.
In many an artistic suburb of our
great cities the caste system shades
off from boulevard to back alley like
iris on the neck of burnished dove, to
dull slate beneath. The “colonel’s
lady and Judy O’Grady may be sis
ters under the skin,” but it is what is
wrapped about their respective skins
that seems to make all the difference
socially. '
Christianity came into the world in
a sunburst of song. Mary’s magni
ficat was democracy’s charter which
should “put down the mighty from
their seats and exalt them of low
degree.” Christianity came with a
demand for social engineering that
shocked the satisfied walkers on the
old trails.. The hills of pride, preju
dice, and privilege must be cut down.
The valleys of poverty and human de
gradation must be filled l up. The
crooked places must be straightened
and the rough made plain, and all
flesh should see it together, a demo
cratic cosmopolitan group meeting on
a common level in need of a common
repentance, common faith a require
ment, and common- fellowship as of
one great brotherhocd the sublime
ideal. If, as a nation, we have left
our program behind us, the church
within the nation must be the voice

MY MOTHER'S BIBLE
This book is all that’s left me now—
Tears will unbidden start—
With faltering lip and throbbing brow
I press it to my heart.
For many generations past
Here is our family tree;
My mother’s hands this Bible clasped
She, dying, gave it me.
Ah! well do I remember those
Whose names these records bear;
Who round the hearthstone used to
close,
After the evening prayer,
And speak of what these pages said
In tones my heart would thrill!
Though they are with the silent dead,
Here are they living still!
My father read this holy book
To brothers, sisters, dear;
How callh was my poor mother’s look,
loved God’s word to hear!
Her angel face—l see it yet!
What thronging memories come!
Again that little group is met
Within the halls of home!—Sel.

A MILLION FOR A CROSS
WHEN THE CROSS OF
CALVARY IS FREE
A fool and her money are soon
parted. Observation and velvety re
straint in a a nice cotton-upholstered
psychopathic ward would seem to
be a logical necessity for some rich
American women. There’s Miss
Belle Skinner of Holyoke, Mass., for
example—Miss Belle Skinner, “too
much rich,” who has wasted one
million dollars and five years’ time
in rebuilding a moss-covered, “his
toric” French town of two hundred
inhabitants.
When one thinks of the hundreds
of struggling, poorly-endowed Amer
ican colleges to whom a million dol
lars or any reasonable part of it
would be a godsend and a continu
ing blessing to countless American
students, one feels constrained to say
to such an irresponsible person,
“Waster and fool, the gifts of Provi
dence whose steward you are, slip
through your spendthrift fingers. The
wistful eyes of innumerable school
children of America look reproachful
ly at you!”
To throw away one million excel
lent American dollars on two hun
dred French peasants when a few
thousands of that sum would have
built them good comfortable homes,
if such a philanthropy were deemed
essential to the welfare of the world,
is little less than a crime against
one’s country.
In the final analysis, people of
great wealth and power do not be
long strictly 'to themselves —they
belong to their nation. And their
resources should be administered as
carefully as any public trust. But,
perhaps Miss Skinner was merely
playing to her own vanity and pay
ing a fancy price for the Cross of a
Chevalier of the Legion of Honor,
with which foreign bauble the French
government decorated her.

IS THERE A KOCK-ROACH
IN THE OLD KLAN KLOCK?
Dear Sir:—
Thinking and pondering over the
cause for the remarkable outburst of
fanatical hatred and persecution
against the Klan, I had almost de
cided to sum up the entire matter,
and call it quits, by remarking to my
self, “ALL THESE FREE SCHOOLS
AND SO MUCH IGNORANCE.”
Then I recalled that there is a large
element of our society that purposely
excludes its young from our free
schools, therefore it must be some
thing BESIDES FREE SCHOOLS
THAT CREATES the bigotry and ig
norance, that becomes criminally open
in assults upon the thing that their
fellow citizens, have with all pro
priety and right chosen as desirable
to them.
Mysticism
Almost since the beginning of time
men have been holding meetings of
all sorts; going through certain, (to
outsiders,) mystic ceremonies. They
have in all ages chosen freakish non
mencleature to denominate the dif
ferent department, ceremonies and
passwords to their secret realms.
Men in all times have chosen, when
they have seen fit, to apparel them
selves in outlandish, and sometimes
heathenish costumes, to appear in
ceremonials that were intended to be
in honor of a Supreme Being.
The great secret orders of the
world have added to themselves all
sorts of form and ceremony, until
some of them have become to resem
ble a certain religious society, which
has always made a great ado about
cornets and jewels, ring and regalia,
millinery and frumpery.
Such organizations and secret so
cieties have almost made themselves
deadening and disgusting; almost as
deadening as has that religious so
ciety, which permits whatever of the
Bible that is used by them, to be read
only in a dead language, so that the

Those KOPYKAT organizations, in
their temples, or halls, or whatever
they call their meeting places, even
imitate and ape the parades of the
head of that religious society, when
he marches midst drawn swords of
the soldiery, and practices at being
the head of the church, the head of
the State —and usurper of every
place Tn heaven and earth. How they

Men Love Mystery
Men love mystery. They will go
far to choose their AIR CASTLE
TERMS. It is their desire to make
other men curious about them. They
go to such end that they sometimes
cause themselves to be held up to
ridicule. It is not infrequent that
we find Catholic editors holding up
the Shriners and their uniforms to
the ridicule of their readers, along
with their rites, ceremonies and names
of their different presiding officers.
If one wants to know how great
denunciation of Masons is demanded
of Catholic by the Pope, he needs but
to read the Encyclical Letters of Leo'
XIII. There he will find, to incite
Catholics to hatred and bigotry, the
FALSEST OF CALUMNIES UPON
MASONRY, its rites and ceremonies.
Read the Catholic press and note
how it refers, to our Masonic breth
ren as “pot bellied” “nit wits,” etc.
Man The Mystic
Mysticism knows no bounds, for it
takes long training fpr man to lose
his habit to desire to peep into the
beyond. Instead of taking his peep
in logical spiritual ways, man is like
ly to search every other way first.
Man permits his immagination full
play. There are then but few human
beings who do not love mystery. To
mystify others seems to be the con
suming desire of most human beings.
That is to a large extent harmless,
and there is no reason why men
should not invent terms to suit what
they think they would like to be
spiritually.
Invisible Empire
It was not wrong for man to in
vent an INVISIBLE REALM, nor an
INVISIBLE EMPIRE, but in those
two terms. I believe I have come to
find the greatest thunder that the
wilfully criminal foes of the Klan, use
to attempt its undoing. I have won
dered if it were ignorance that pre
vented them seeing the harmlessness
of the Klan INVISIBLE EMPIRE,
or if it were pure down right wilfull
ness that made them profess to be
lieve and charge that the INVISIBLE
EMPIRE is a SUPER-GOVERN
MENT set up to rule the visible gov
ernment of this nation, rather than
a harmless something, that means no
more than any other term of a secret
ritual; a something as harmless as
the HOLY OF HOLIES of the Old
Testament. The writer believes that
INTENTIONAL DUPLICATE EXPOSURE
the Klan has as much right to INVIS
IBLE EMPIRE as any various lodges
have to call any of their rites by the
names that they do. This writer also
believes that the INVISIBLE EM
PIRE of the Klan is an innocent thing
to which no man if he knew the in
side would object. Man on the out
side may have his objection, and in
this case, the case of the INVISIBLE
EMPIRE, he voices his objection in
no uncertain terms. He sees in it an
opportunity to do ill to his fellow man
and at his expense to make political
capital. So long as he can foster the
interests of his own religious society,
or his own political fortunes, it makes
little difference to him. He will stop
at no crime to bring an indictment
against his fellow citizens in their
harmless use of terms if it furthers
his interests.
ignorant and hence bigoted, and wfio
ignorant and hpnce higoted, and who
have been brought to believe that
great crowds of men and women can
be gathered into secret societies for
the doing of wrong. The teachings
of a certain sect, and their adherence
to a certain form of education, would
compel us to know that there are
those so ignorant as to believe such
things.
However the great opposition that
is brought against the Klan, and the
untruthfully reiterated statement to
the effect that the INVISIBLE EM
PIRE is a super government, which
intends, or does control the visible
government, does not come from the
ignorant and bigoted, who have been
held under the heel 61 a superstitious
religious society. BUT IT COMES
FROM MEN WHO HAVE HAD
HIGHER ADVANTAGES, AND
WHO KNOW BETTER; WHOSE
VERY OPPORTUNITIES FOR
KNOWING THEIR FELLOW CITI
ZENS OF ALL SORTS. WOULD
PRECLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF
THEIR BEING DECEIVED. Those
men are using, as follows, those made
ignorant, and kept ignorant by that
religious sect, to make more weighty
their work in numbers.
Drop The Term
I had intended, in a friendly was,
to advise the powers at the head of
the Klan to drop the use of that
term to designate their Supreme
Realm, but thinking it over, I decid
ed there were too many asses in the
world now, giving gratuitous advice.
I thought over the various other sug
gestions made by officials and gather
ings of different sort. One asked
that the Klan disband. Another said
“TAKE OFF YOUR MASKS.” An
other said “drop your oath,” just as
if they knew whether or not there
was such a thing taken by Klansmen;
Another said this, and another said
that. Finally I came to the conclu
sion that if I were connected with
the Klan and so much free advice as
to WHAT THE KLAN OUGHT TO
DO WERB OFFERED ME, I would
finally get me a stock answer to
make to all, —which would read some
thing like this; “Oh—tell them to go
—well why don’t you tell them ? Tell
them that the Klan got along some
how before it received any sugges
tions at all, and in spite of all sug
gestions, the Klan is going to run its
affairs—in its own way, without ad
vice or hindrance of any sort from
outsiders.” Personally I should ap
plaud any man who answered med
dlers from the outside in that man
ner. As . Mason, as an Elk, as a
member of various other secret or
ganizations, I am obliged, under a
solemn pledge of secrecy, never to
reveal what goes on within the lodge
room. Traitors have reveiled what
goes on in all of them. Some of those
secrets are in print and can be bought
for a price, but having a sense of
honor I shall neer knowingly reveal
a secret of any of my various orders,
AND WOULD, WITH MY BLOOD
PAY THE PRICE OF PREVENT
ING ANY SET OF MEN ATTEMPT
ING TO TREAT MY FELLOW
LODGEMEN, AS I KNOW IT HAS
BEEN ATTEMPTED TO TREAT
KLANSMEN. Furthermore I should
consider it an insult to the intellig
ence of Masons or any of my orders,
for outsiders to presume to tell us
how to run them. When I turn to
the Encyclical Letters of Pope Leo
XIII and read what he has said of
ation, that a churchman, professing
to be so high in authority, could stoop
so low in his effort to falsify and to
misrepresent Masonry, into which he
nor any of his followers can ever hope
to enter.
The Deeper The Mystery
I have corhe to the conclusion that
the deeper the mystery the better
man likes it, and the more interesting
it becomes, therefore I tell you Klans
men to run your order just the way
it suits you to run it. Hang on to
everyone of your names and your
rites and ceremonies. Make them
mystical and keep them so. Let the
other fellows do the guessing. It
will do them good. It is high time
that some society be in existence that
can keep a certain religious society
worried. It is high time that the ar
rogance of certain members of the
negro race be awed and made to be
lieve that the GOBLINS WILL GET
THEM IF THEY DON’T LOOK OUT.
It is high time that the bootlegger
who has poisoned his hundreds of
thousands should begin to feel that
a far seeing eye is upon him, whether
it is there or not. It is high time
that the consort of the negro wench,
and the lower scum who marries to
black blood, should begin to realize
that Almighty God made men white
and black for a purpose, and that for
him to try to defeat that purpose
only brings him to the point where
he should be dealt with, if he isn’t
actually so. Keep up the mystery
Klansmen, for we who are white,
American born, Protestant Christians
are getting the itch, from our cur
iosity, and we can be won over if you
keep us guessing. We are simply go
ing to join to learn what is inside, If
for nothing else.
That part of the population is not
worried, they are just itching, and the
day is coming no doubt, when the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, if it
KEEPS THEM ALL ITCHING WITH
CUROSITY, can boast in all truth
fulness that in its existence it has
enrolled as members or applicants
for membership, every single white
Protestant Christian, American born
citizen of the United States. They all
want to get in and see what it ldoks
like. Maybe when they get in they
will be likj the Irishman, who couldn’t
understand why his alarm clock
wouldn’t run. He opened it out of
curiosity to know, and being a sta
tionary engineer, when he saw a
cockroach in the works, he exclaimed,
“By gorry, no wonder, the engineers
dead.”
“Can’t Get The Inners”
From those who can get in, or who
think they are qualified, the Klan
need have no fear. But there is a
great horde of other people excluded
by the Klan. There are three distinct
bodies of them. First the Negro.
The Negro is not worrying. Fact is
the better element of the Negroes are
rejoiced, because they feel that the
Negro clocks and lawless will behave
themselves better if they have a NO
TION mistaken as it is,—THAT
SOMETHING IN A BED SHEET,
RESEMBLING A HAUNT—IS GO
ING TO GET THEM IF THEY
DON’T LOOK OUT. Negroes are
easy going, no matter whether harm
less or criminal. They are not both
ering about the Klan. In fact they
have forgotten that the Klan exists,
and THEREFORE YOU DO NOT
HEAR VERY MUCH ABOUT FRIC
TION BETWEEN NEGROES AND
KLANSMEN.
Others “Can’t Get Inners.”
The Jews are another clique that
can’t get in. But there isn’t one Jew
out of 500 who gives the Klan a sec
ond thought. The reason for that is
that the Jews have begun to think.
Once you get a Jew to thinking, he
usually gets at the bottom of things,
because he applies wisdom to think
ing. Jews who have been misled by
others are rapidly falling away from
societies that have organized to fight
the Klan. He has recognized that the
fight is not necessary, and CER
TAINLY NOT WORTH HIS PAY
ING THE FREIGHT FOR A LOT
OF UNSCRUPULOUS POLITICIANS
AND RELIGIONISTS TO KEEP
ALIVE THE SPIRIT OF HATRED,
as they have been doing, ONLY TO
MAKE UNNECESSARY AND BIT
TER ENEMIES FOR THE JEWS.
The Chief Can’t Get Inners
The chief can’t get inners are the
OPPONENTS AND DEADLY EN
EMIES OF THE PROTESTANT
CHRISTIAN RELIGION. That takes
in the whole breed. However it needs
no wiseacre to know that such fac
tions as the I. W. W., Socialists and
Anarchists, who pretend to do away
with God and Christ, and who of
course are considered enemies of the
Protestant Christian religion, are not
very much interested in whether the
Klan survives or perishes. It is rare
to bear of any friction betwen those
elements of society and the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan.
That then leaves but one great
body as unremittingly opposed to the
Klan; ever militant and aggressive in
its desire to strike it down. That is
the body which is governed, controlled
and marshaled as the ROMAN CATH
OLIC HIERARCHY DIRECTS, and
DICTATES. In its various ramifi
cations, and its various societies, such
as the K. C.’s, A. O. H.’s, Molly Ma
guires, etc., it has in all ages wielded
a desperately wicked power against
the forces of Protestantism, and for
years against Americanism.
Itching to know whqt goes on with
in the INVISIBLE REALM that or
ganization would turn heaven and
earth to gain the knowledge. Per
haps were it to get inside, it might
feel very foolish, or be compelled to
think as the Irishman who discovered
the cock roach in the clock.
Denied admission that organization
is NOT IGNORANTLY GOING
ABOUT TRYING TO DESTROY
THE KLAN, BUT IT IS PURPOSE
LY, WITHOUT CRIMINAL INTENT
GOING ABOUT TO DESTROY
WHAT IT BELIEVES TO BE THE
GREATEST ENEMY THAT HAS
EVER ARISEN AGAINST CATHO
LICISM.
