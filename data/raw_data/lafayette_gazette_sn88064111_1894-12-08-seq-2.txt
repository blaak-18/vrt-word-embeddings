- ew York has 30,000 barbers,

SSenator Blanchard has presented t(
a resolution in the Senate protesting t
against the recent Turkish atroci- n
ties perpetrated on the Armenians,
and directing that the remonstrance
of this government be communi- r
fated to Turkey.
Now that Callahan and Dudous- b
sat have been found guilty of ac- a
cepting bribes, let the court proceed c
in the good work until every rascally p
official who sold himiself is sent to w
.the penitentiary. With a few more o
convictions it will dawn upon ii
certain class that the law again a
bribery is not quite dead. -" -..t
The Louisiana Lottery Co. seems s:
to be at its old tricks again. Sena- ti
tor Call, of Florida, has offered a a
resolution in the Senate for the ap- it
pointment of a special committee t
to inquire as to what extent the
Louisiana or Honduras Lottery was s
operating in Florida, whether it r
had sought to control State or na- t
tional elections; whether money had t
not been expended by them in the t
recent elections of members of
Congress, and whether they did not t
own or subsidize newspapers in that t
State.
Y. T. Faun is the name of a Den
ver Chinaman who is really in hard
luck. Having been convicted of
a felony he can not register and olb
tain an American certificate, but e
must be deported. Shorn of his a
queue according to prison disci- t
pline, he will be decapitated in 2
true barbarian style the moment he h
sets foot on Chinese soil. He can a
not remain in the United States and t
not live in China. The United 1
States must send him away and
can only send him to China. Faun
has no recourse against the United s
States for the sacrifice of his queue, i
without which he cannot return to
China with any degree of safety for
his head. t
The teeth-gnashing among Dem- d
ocrats had hardly subsided when E
Washington correspondents gave out
the painful news that Grover had
the gout. Some peo;,le may be
credulous enough to believe this re- 1
port, but The Gazette refuses to
entertain any such preposterous 1
thing. A Democratic president af- 4
flicted with the gout ! A thing so
notoxiousiy undemocratic as the I
gout ! Perish the thought ! It is I
nothing but the contemptible fabri
cation of some Republican news
paper man. No ! Jeffersonian sim
plicity and the gout don't go to- 1
gether.
A bill has been introduced in the
Alabama Legislature to prohibit the
playing of match games of foot
ball. The trouble is that we have 1
too many such absurd laws infring
ing on the rights of individuals. Why
not pass a law prohibiting games
of base ball, lawn tenis, and keep
on until every form of amusement
is prohibited by law. It seems to,
ns that if college professors are not
sufficiently -jintelligent and humane
to suppress games of brutal ten
dencies without being forced to do
so by statutory enactments the
country is going to the "'demnition
bow-wows,"regardless of all the laws
that modern legislatures are capa
ble of passing.
The secretary of the treasury
reports that the receipts of the gov
ernment from all sources of revenue
during the fiscal year ending June
So, 1894, amounted to $372,802,
498. 29.and its expenditures to $442,
605,758.87, leaving a deficit of $69
803,260.58. There was a decrease
of $1z5,952,674.66 in the ordinary
expenses of the government as com
pared with th fiscal year 1893.
There was collected from customs
13x,8x8,53o.62, and from internal
revenue $m47,168,449.70. The bal
ance of the income for the year
amounting to $93,815,5t7.97, was
derived from the sales of land and
.other sources.

2'.E SALO ONS. b
Cleveland Plain Dealer.
"Saloons must go" declare the h
earnest workers in the W. C. T. U. t
Certainly the world would be bet
ter off if they would go, but will h
they? Can the legislature of a com- t
munity be of higher mental and b
moral tone than that of the people f
of the community? Can the spring Z
rise higher than its source? There
is a wide difference in this matter I
between what would seem desirable
and what is practicable to be ac
complished. The Christian tem
perance women are doing a great a
work in inculcating popular antag
onism to the misuse of liquor. The e
introduction into the common P
schools of the study of the ill ef
fects of alcohol upon the human I
system is certainly leading to a bet- i
ter physical as well as a better mor
al manhood. And all the potent
influences of these zealous women
-tend to the improvement of the race.
But they must themselves have ob
served that all the good they have
really accomplished has been
through intellectual and ethical cul- a
tivation of the individual and not
through the compulsion of the
State. The saloon must go when
the desire for liquor is gone. When
the heart of humanity has been
made right in this matter the ques
tion will be solved. These noble
women are doing a wonderfully ef
fective work in this direction. All i
true reforms are wrought through
education. In the meantime, how
ever, it is wiser for the State to do
a little that is practical than to at
tempt much that is impossible.
Zeal often overreaches itself, and it
has done so in Ohio. When the
anti-license clause was inserted in
to the constitution in order that sa
loons might not be given legal rec
ognition in this State, opportunity
for proper control of the traffic was I
sacrificed. The great need in Ohio
is legal supremacy over the evil so
long as it exists-and it will in all
probability exist quite long enough
to make it worth while to get it un
der right control.

kiss a handsomte woman; may 250
nightmares trot quarter races over
his stomach every night; may his
coffee be sweetened with flies and
seasoned with caterpillars; may his
boots leak, his gun hang fire, and
his fishing line break; may his wife
run off with his best friend, and his
children have the whooping cough;
may the famine stricken ghost of an
editor's baby haunt his slumbers
and whisper murder in his dream
ing ear; may his cattle have wolves
in 'em; may his mnules have the
blind staggers and the pigs destroy
the garden; may a troop of printers'
devils lean, lank and hungry, dog
his heels each day, and a regiment
of cats eternally catawaul under his
window each night. may his cows
give sour milk and churn rancid
butter, and in conclusion, good

A 3lillionaire's Vengeante.
John Jacob Astor is determined
that an adequate vengeance shall be
visited on the tramp Garvin, "t.e
IBowery Trooper," who filoniously
slipped into the Astor palace
and heinously went to sleep in one
of its best beds. As soon as the
millionaire heard of the case he hur
ried off to the police station, ac
companied by his brother-in-law
and his brother, to prosecute the
outrageous offender, who had dtlared
pollute the Astor linen and insult
the Astor exclusiveness; and when i
he found that the fellow had been i
let off with an ordinary $5 fine for
trespass, just as though he had en
tered unlawfully the premises of an
ordinary American citizen, his an
ger was unbounded, and he pointed
d out to the justice that so ridiculous
ly light a punishment might lead to
a repetition of the offense. Any
tramp might be willing to pay $5 for
the privilege of sleeping in an Astor
ihed. H-e then proceeded to sweat
I out a warrant against Qarvin for
burglary. Of course, an over
awed jury will convict the mis
creant.---Exchange.

the faint but clingsome perfume of
a long-vanished polecat, as the dy

fading memory of a wicked dream tic
or the lingering taste of a cheap ci- 9c
gar, so shall we think on the Ala- of
bama statesman that was, but Is not. m
With one final spluttering protest he R
has passed. In the dim and fading es
twilight that borders the land of the tr.
forgotton a word-weary band awaits la
his coming with melancholy expec- ec
tation. A pageant of grimy and be
bedraggled whiskers glooms darkly fo
for a moment against the dim hori- S
zon, and then the sad procession sa
fades from mortal eye and assimi- H
lates with the darkness. Waite, e
