Diaz, the Cuban Missionary
Dear Sir and Brother:—l do not
know where Diaz, the Cuban mis
sionary is. But he is a native Cu
ban, and up to three years ago re
sided on Zulueta street, Havana,
Cuba. General delivery might reach
him, or the United States consul
could give you his street address.
I have a very complete review of
his career in Cuba, in a series of
fifteen articles which I prepared
from the documentary records of his
relations with the Home Board,
which were published in the Baptist
Flag and Arkansas Baptist. The
Home Board outraged his rights at
every point; it was a moral assassi
nation purely. I shall be glad if you
will get hold of the matter with your
legal acumen and give “’em a few
on it.” See Chap. VII, page 133 o 2
my book, “The Bible, the Baptists
and the Board System.” Diaz is a man
of marked ability and consecration,
for a Cuban. He reads and speaks
English fairly well, and up to the
episode with the Home Board was
the pet missionary of the Southern
Baptist Convention. As a speaker
he is powerful. I saw him sway an
audience until his organic enemy, the
president of the Southern Baptist
Convention, rushed on the stage and
hugged him, at Little Rock, Ark. A
thousand people witnessed it.
Another matter: Our General As
sociation here was just splendid. We
are making the appeal straight to
the churches to rise up and cast off
the Convent{ion-Board system, and
take direct control of their own mis
sion work, cutting out subsidy,
schools, gymnastics, etc., on mission
fields, and support missionaries to
do what the Lord said do, preach the
gospel and instruct the churches in
their principles and liberties, and
then go on to other fields.
We have missionaries in Mexico,
Syria, Persia and Cuba, and several
in the home field, who are working
to strike these Convention shackles
from the liberties of both churches
and missionaries. Our plan is to util
ize existing local associations, which
messengers go direct from the
churches; then form State associa
tions, also composed of direct church
messengers; and we have already a
General Association composed of
messengers direct from the churches,
with a mission commission under or
ders to do the things they are told
to do. In few words, a referendum
system which puts the churches in
absolute control of their work and
cuts out the middlemen’s big sala
ries and authority.
Now, can’t you help us in this
work? I mean is there not room in
Georgia for such a move? I know
there are many Baptists in Georgia
ready for it, and others can be won
to it. We have State associations al
ready in Arkansas, Texas, Kentucky,
Tennessee and Mississippi, and we
want to extend the work. Our Mis
sion committee, of which I am rec
ording secretary and treasurer, is
looking for a man in Georgia to take
hold with us.
My idea would be to agitate and
educate until next autumn and then
call on the churches to send messen
gers to form a State Association
along the lines indicated above. Have
3effersontah
a good man to carry the conflict
into the local associations, preach,
distribute literature and campaign
all over the State. We can help such
a man, and he can find much help
in Georgia.
The attitude of the Index will help
you immensely. The masses love
fair play.
Our view is that we need co-oper
ation in this work. Individuals can
not meet and overcome compact and
capitalized organizations. We must
counter-organize, with -Clean-cut
principles and a plain issue. We are
doing this most successfully out here
and reaching out all over the land.
Our committee will meet again
soon, and we desire to have your
counsel and opinion of the best way
to do it. Please take time to formu
late and give us your views as fully
as possible.
I am sending this in enclosed with
answer to your business manager
concerning clubbing arrangements
with my magazine, Plain Truth.
We can help each other. Count
on me and on us to do you all the
good we can, and we want recipro
cal and co-operative effort all along
the line.
Yours very truly,
J. A. SCARBORO.
