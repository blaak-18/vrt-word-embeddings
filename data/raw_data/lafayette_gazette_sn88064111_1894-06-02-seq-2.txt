MR. MOUTON'S EDUCA- I
TION4L &LLLs
The bill introduced by the mewt- .
ber of the Legislature from Lafay
ette prohibiting the employment of
any minister of the gospel, member
of any religious order or teacher of
religion as teacher in the public
schools of this State, was finally
passed in the House of Representa
tives on Tuesday by a vote of 63
yeas to 7 nays evidencing the pop
ularity of the measure in the lower
house. 4
The idea involved of the total
separation of church and State, is
in full accordswith the principles of
our government. The school taxes
are collected by the State from all
her citizens, and consequently must
be expended for the education of
all, without preference to any reli
gious sect or denomination.
Our organic law, State and
national, expressly -prohibits any
lqgislation for the establishment of
any religion or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof; therefore, the funds
levied for educational purposes
should not be diverted for the bene
fit of any sectarian school. The
law does not, even by implication,
evince any prejudice, much less
enmity, against any church or reli
gion; the evident object of it being
to secure for all the use of the
school fund, without offense to any
creed, on hindrance to the free ex
ercise of any faith. Its enactment
will undoubtedly prevent the occur
rence; in this State, of the serious
troubles which arose in other States
by reason' of the divergence of
public school funds' for sectarian
purposes.
A RAILROAD COMMISSIOZL
The Houma Courier.
A bill of vital importance to the
people of Louisiana is one recently
introduced in the Legislature by
Representative Mouton of Lafay
ette, to create a railroad commis
sion, and to provide for the regula
tion of rates on railroads. Sub
stantially this bill provides, that,
from the State at large, the Governor
shall appoint three commissioners
at an annual salary of $zooo or
$3000. The appointment of these
commissioners will be confirmed by
the Senate and they will be required
to furnish bonds of S1o,ooo each
for the faithful performance of their
duty.
Mr. Mouton asserts that the ob
ject of the bill will not be to retard
the growth of the railroad interests
of the State but to allow a fair and
equitable return to the railroads on
the capital invested, while at the
same time it will have a restraining
effect on these large and very often
rapacious corporations.
In many parts of the State and
particufarly in Southern Louisiana,
the people are entirely at the mercy
of grinding railroad corporations.
They are forced to abide by any
schedule of rates that the railroads
may see fit to impose on them.
Lately the railroad corporations
throughout this State have shown a
disposition to make reductions in
freight rates. This move is- a com
mendable one and one that has
been appreciated by the people of
every portion of the State whose
interests are materially benefited by
the reductions. But this fact
should not exert an influence in re
straining the passage of Mr. Mou
ton's bill. Under the present laws
of this State the railroads have a
perfect right to cancel any of the
present rates and charge as much
for transportation as they may see
fit. It is this power that the bill
aims to limit.
Two years ago, during the ses
sion of the Legislature a bill similar
to the one now before that body
was introduced in the House of
Representatives and referred to the
commission on railroads. This
commission was composed of thir.
teen members, five in- favor and
seven agaiist the passage of the
measurne and consequently the bill
was pigeon-holed. About this
time, however, Mr. Depont one
of our representatives from this
parish, offered the following bom
shell resolution which created con
sternation for a little while in rail
road circles and threatened to blow
up the little game that was unmis
takably at the bottom of the pigeon
hole scheme:
*"WSIERAS, House bill No, Io6, prom
vided for the creation of a railiuanl commis
sion is a measure of great importaie- to: the
State, and one in which the wrhite people
are greatly interested; and
"WirErrAS, the present session- of the
General Assembly is drawing, to a close,
and the calendar is becoming crowded t
such an extent that an early consideration
of this bill is rendered necessary in order to
pass it at this session;
'Be it therefore resolved, That the com
mittee on railroads be and it is hereby di
rected to report said House bill No. 106 to
the-Housesoa or before Thursday, 23rd.
These- resolutions finally passed
by a' vote of 45 to 24. This
brouiht the committee on rail
roads-to tiine and they of course
handed in an unfavorabl-e report.
Subsequently a vote for iadefinite
postponement was taken- ik the
House, the result' Bieihg S ' yearsi
-2 nays and aS members-absent.
STzE CouxIxx earnestly hopes;
Sat Mr. Mouton's bill will not
eet with a, simil 'te. Texas
hs had a railroad ni,; ssion for
. .nnmbe s" 4t ears. a  it- has' iven
protection and general satisfactiont
jto the people of State. During the
existence of the commission there
has been no noticeable decline in
in the growth of railroad interests
in that State. If anything the del
velopment has been more rapid
than before the establishment of the
railroad commission.
A LESSON IN FIGHTING.
Courier-Journal,
I is not often that the Courier
Journal finds anything to approve
about the_ protectionists, but we
should lik to see the tariff reform
trimmers of the Senate take a lesson
from them in fighting. We admire
pluck sherever we see it. We
love a good fighter, who plants him
self squarely, hits out boldly and
takes his punishment like a man.
The protectionists are wholly
wrong in the principle.. Their
policy has been overwhelmingly
condemned at the polls. Yei wit -
out the moral support of righteous
and popular cause, they toe the
mark with scarcely a break an the
ranks and fight plckhily Jor the
whole McKinley hog or ione.
We don't hear from them any
talk of concession or compromises.
They have sent out decoys to un
cover the weakness of their antag
onists. They have felt the Demo
cratic position thoroughly. They
have made feints enough to learn
that the Democratic leaders in the
Senate are afraid of them, that
they would rather have an arm
istice than a fight, and that they are
ripe for almost any kind of compro
mise. And when they have found
out all about the troubles in the op
posing camp, the cowardice that
disturbs it and the treachery that
deivides it, they plant themselves
squarely on the McKinley Bill and
demand that or nothing. Their
newspaper organs are denouncing
all talk of concessions as nonsense
and a confession of weakness,
Democratic concessions have ac
complished nothing but Democratic
dishonor, to be followed by the
danger of Democratic disaster.
The faithless cowards in the Senate
have suffered themselves to be en
trapped throt:gh their timidity into
a position where victory will be
little less dishonorable now than
defeat. There is no animpaired
principle left to fight for, that has
been abandoned to the enemy aO an
ineffectual bribe. Dispirited, di
vided, deprived of the moral stimu
lus that carried it through the cam
paign of 1892, betrayed by its
leaders and weakened by desertions,
the party in Congress fights now
for only the poor privilege of drag
ging itself off the field, battered
and bafiled, but sure to come again
to ultimate victory.
Never was a reverse more clearly
traceable to the lack of an inspiring
moral courage. "T'he Democratic
cause in Congress has been
Â£"managed" to death. Some of its
leaders have been too smart by
half. There have been too many
strategists and too few fighters, too
much courtesy and too little grape
and canister. Too many men have
left the ranks to look after the com
missary. At any rate the Demo
cratshave learned a lesson, although
at greivous cost. They have
learned that no position iv so safe
as an honest one, and that victory
is not to be purchased at the sacri
fice of a principle or of any part of
Busklen's- Arnica Salve.
