done, in the Spanish rev-
olution. Uncensored reports do not
yet reach the outside world. With
governmental sanction could alone
be expected just such dispatches as
showed the revolutionists as execra
ble savages, while the constant ex
ecutions of the rioters must lead the
unbiased mind to the conclusion that
all the brutality is not on one side.
Things have not gone well for the
Spanish troops in Morocco, and the
quiet restored in Barcelona has about
it that grim tension from which
much worse things yet may come.
In all written history, no more
breath-taking, absolute courage has
been displayed than by the Spaniard
and it is perhaps a realization of this
which gives us pause. Decadent
though Spain has been, there is yet
that feline quality of treachery, and
wild-cat ferocity, which gives the on

dread, now that the land seems

ly every form of rec
reation and secular activity. The
new law is so loosely worded that
anything may, or may not be per
mitted, under whatever interpreta
tion the Court may place upon the
particular incident brought to its at
tention. From which, one is led to
making the bromidic remark that
progress is in a circle, never a direct
line. Connecticut’s former “blue
laws’’, though not exclusive, were so
severe as to give that State the unen
viable distinction of having formu
lated provisions of the most drastic
severity known. A few genera
tions passed since those were obso
lete, and a few solons “reverted to
type’’ and enacted laws as strange
and harsh, for this era as were the
former Puritanical prohibitions.

Thus swings the pendulum. So
ciety cannot be allowed to become
completely individualized, for that
means the strong preying on the
weak, and gross wrongs in the name
of liberty. And it cannot become
wholly socialized, for that means
that the individual is martyred to
whatever may be the dominant idea,
or error of his superior in numbers.
A society, socialized sufficiently to
encourage individual liberty along
lines that hurt no one in actuality,
even though they do tread upon the
toes of somebody’s narrow creed, is
apparently the ideal human condi
tion.

seldom heard in Amer
ica today. He has lost his attempt
completely to prove that he was now
“medically sane’’, although, for pur
poses of defeating the limit of jus
tice, he might have been “legally
sane’’ during his trial for the mur
der of Stanford White.
In recommitting Thaw to the asy
lum at Matteawan, Judge Mills re
views the case clearly and succinctly
and takes the admirable position
that, in sending him back he goes as
a “patient” and not as a “culprit”.
With the position of the justice, who
could quarrel? If guilty, Thaw
should have been electrocuted; if
insane, then to be treated, if possible
restored to health, but not subject to
whatever extraneous punitive meas
ures irresponsible attendants might
impose. O, just judge! May thy
tribe increase! Though he were an
angel of innocence, nothing could re
store to life the slain, and to protect
society from such degenerates as
Thaw is as well done by interminable
incarceration as by killing him. If
the confinement in itself is punish
ment, it is unavoidable. At least,
there need be no horrors heaped
upon horrors, no irresponsible bait

But the reflection logically fol
lows —if ward life is a hardship in
itself, and likely to prevent the cure
of otherwise curable cases, why
should especial consideration be ac
corded Thaw? Why not give the
same humane chance to the others?
The State could not provide for all
its criminal insane at Matteawan the
same immaterial luxuries Thaw’s
means permit, but taking the posi
tion that it is a misfortune to be
come insane, and a terrible addition
to that misfortune that the diseased
mind was led to crime, the funda
mentals to aid in restoration to
health, if possible, should be pro
vided, and could be at slightly in
creased first cost of suitable build
ings and sufficient attendants.
Judge Mills paid his respects to
that sort of medical testimony that
can be hired to testify one way or
another and voiced the general pro
test against such unethical methods.
Though no remedy appears until, by
abolition of capital punishment alto
gether, the incentive to plead insan

of sanity exists, and there is no more

reason why a man should be contin

should remain from birth to death in
perfect physical health. Why should
not the brain get “out of order” as
often as the stomach, for instance?
Both are over-worked, both often
feed upon most improper food, both
subject to injury from within and
without. Really the dyspeptic might
have more excuse for committing
homicide than the paranoiac. Jus
tice should, after all, not need the
intercession of the alienist to induce
it impartially to restrain and punish
the guilty, impartially to restrain
and protect society, realizing that in
vengeance there is no victory.
President Barret, of the Adams
Express Company, has succeeded in

Circuit Judge Baker an

tax valuation upon his company’s
property of $239.50 per mile for the
1,518 miles of railroad on which the
express company operates, declaring
that this valuation should be put at
the modest trifle of $15.75 per mile.
He further contended successfully to
the Federal judge, that the State
Board had no right to consider as
part of the company’s operating prop
erty some $36,000,000 bonds repre
senting accrued profits from its oper
ations.
Wonder if Justice Brewei* would
consider an evasion of taxation of
this sort any devitalizing of a state’s
rights? Or any reason for an in
come tax to take a drop of this
rich cream drawn from the resources
of the people of the state, out of the
buckets of President Barret and his
stockholders?

“Hundreds of girls have been so

the Congressman. “The women who
