The Policy.
Tbhe D)emocric victory iu Missis
siplpi iereby r Reiullica re majoii
ty of 56,000 was ovrrcomne by a
Denicftio one of 40,000, has inf
duced the Shreveport Times, with
the less respectable journals, to de
dare the campaign of 1876 must be
conducted on a strictly color line,
and inaugurate a "shot gun" and
"plug ugly" canvass. This may be
the programme of the Demrqorats for
1876, and an effort may be made to
carry such out, but our friends must
recollect that Republicans have
some weapons of defense. While
the Republicans are unwilling to re
pel force by force, they may be in a
condition to be strictly on the de
fensive, and prevent what seems to
he an easy task for our political op
ponents. The Republican party are
armed for the contest of '7r1.
1st. Having largely the majority
of voters, which will be undoubtedly
polled, come what may.
2d. The platform and State ticket
will be of such a character as will
disarm the Democrats, drawing from
their ranks thousands of Conserva
tive voters.
3d. Such guarantees to those de
siring a free selection of tickets, that
freedom of speech may be indulged
in by Republicans and Democrats.
We admit the defeat to the Re
publicans in Mississippi was caused
by thbo constant outbreaks brought
on by the White Liners, whereby
thousands of negroes became intimi
dated and did not vote, or those vo
ting, were made for the time being,
Democrats. Such will not bear re
petition. The attention of the lead
ers of the Republican party was
drawn from Mississippi to a severe
contest in thosn great Northern
States, and the election went by de
fault. If the Constitutional clause
which says, the Federal Government
shall protect each State against in
vasion and domestic violence, means
anything, then the Republican party
means to be protected in their rights
arm of the Government. Do our
Democratic friends think for a mo
ment, that such a state of lawless
ness will be permitted to exist in this
State? We answer, no. Rather
than advocate violence and mob
law, these Democratie journals should
council moderation, and a declara
tion of those principles which per
mits free exipression of opinion, and
free use of the ballot box. Does the
Times, representing a hopeless mi
nority, expect to gain allies by such
conneil? Does it expect to increase
their vote by denouncing men, ex
communicating and ostracising them
from society, because they differ
with the views of this journal?
Many men may be led, not driven,
led by reason, led by argument
but not by threats and abuse. We
only suggest to these journals, what
seems to us a proper way of adding
strength to their side. The policy
of the White Leaguers in 1874, was
to billy Republicans, and we must
admit, it nsnceeded admirably-for
they came near carrying the State,
but bullying won't do, nothing less
than killing, we mean daylight kill
The Vicksburg HERALD is trying to
keep back its Democratio urowd,
which thinks that the old times have
returned. The HEaLD says: "Al
ready a proqpinent and able paper,
in the eastern part of the State, is
advocating the re establishment of
the whipping post, and the begin
ning of the use of the branding iron.
This is all wrong, and in our opinion
very hurtful to our liarty and the
best interests of the State," The
HfaatD is a joust little more enligh
tened than its followers, and thinks
advocatisg a return, to. barbarism
mnay be construed wrongly and made
hurtful to tbe party. Of course if
the I~moeratic party was strong
enough to matintai.e eshotgun
poliey, no such objection would be
made, and on the cheek of colored
Democrats would be branded "D"
by their political ownas. The'whip.

There was a time, piohably; 'when

fell the evil destroyer-but now
when a reduction from 8 per cent.
to 14A mills, almost a nominal tax
is had, the people are satisfied, and
care not who are the officials, wheth
er Republicans or Democrats, so
they are honest. Such being the
case, your cry neighbor, will be un
heeded and unheard. You have
imposed upon the credulity of this
community too long-you have .pab

have cried "the negrdes are rising"
oftentimes when facts were against

longer. Many of bur conservatives
have been duped by your teachings,
and snafered sorely from your ad

to compare the teachings of that
Bourbon schooling, with those brad

canism.-Show your readers how
the Republicans made the limitation
of taxation to 14t mills, the organic
law of the land.-Show them the
doctrine of public education-where
the poor fares alike with the rich,
which is Republican. Show them
how the Republicans are ready to
meet the new issues of the day.
Show them, the attempts made by
Republicans to prevent monopolies
such as lotteries, canals, butchers,
---i.b boagh not least, wharfs.
Ask them, if they are not satisfied
with the parish officials? And in all

That Democratic Victory.
Does any person believe that Mis.
miesippi was fairly and honestly car
ried by the Democrats?' No sane
mann can believe it who considers
the previous political condition of
the State or the circumstances under
which the recent election was con
ducted. That they have carried the
State is undoubtedly true, but that
they carried it by fair or honest
means is a lie. If the election was
quiet and peaceable it was so simply
because the colored voters locked
themselves up in their. cabins on
election day and kept away from the
polls. The Democracy has carried
a Republican State by a deliberate
system of terrorism. By means of
violence, intimidation and murder a
Republican majority of more than
30,000 has been overcome, and in its
place we have a "sweeping Demo
erqtic victory." So completely or
ganized was this scheme of violence
that Republicans were afraid to run
for office, and in many localities
there were no Republican candidates.
Wheretereere re candidates most
of the voters were afraid to vote.
The public can not have forgotten
the repeated massacres of negroes
perpetrated in different parts of the
State while the registration was go
ing on" These have been supple
mented by anonymous letters posted
up in all the country towns and at
the crossroads, warning the negroes
not to vote. Republican meetings
heve been broken up by bodies of
armed men, and Republican speak
ers have been chased into the
swamps for no other offense than the
crime of free speech. Colored men
have been shot down while peace
ably working in the cotton fields,
and have been waylaid and hung in
sequestered places by the roadside.
They have been hunted like squir
rels and murdered like dogs. The
Democratic White Leaguers have
waved the bloody shirt with such
effect as to keep about 40,000 Re
publicans from the polls. The very
thing has taken place which Sena
tor Morton predicted years ago, and
for which he was vilifid and abused
by the Democratic and "indepen
dent press." The rebel element of
the Democratic party has asserted
itself, and the principle of universal
suffrage has been trampled in the
dust. Mississippi has been carried
for the Democracy in the same way
that other Southern States have been
earried before and will be hereafter
-by systematic murder and intimi
dation. Whbile the bloody work is
ing done and the machinery of
iolence put in operation at the
uth, the Northern allies of the
Vhite Leagners-Democrats, dough
aces and gushers-laugh and joke
t the "bloody shirt," and do all
in thbir power to distract the pub
lic mind until the purpose of their
Southern colleagues shall be consum
mated. The essence of the Demo
cratic victory in Mississippi is a
great outrage on universal suffrage
-an opeh violation of law, and a
burlesque upon free eleetions.--[In

Brooklya politicians are excited
over the proposed attempt to show
that Thomas Nevins, the Ring can

Albert Daggett, the Republican can
didate. A carefol count of the offi
elal vote in the Police Central Office
isterday showed a majority of 1,007
ilthe city for Daggett. No official
turn is yet made from the county
wns, but Nevin's friends do not
daount on 400 majority there, and
this will reduce the majority to about
600. Nevins ays that five hundred
Republican State tickets with his
name for Bheriff printed on them
were couated in Daggett'e favor.
He says that themre are other grounds
for a eontest which his lawyer is con
aiering. pnaggett'a friends say that
iif any snch discovery as tbis is made,

The Eleotions.
The returns from all the States
sboh stuch decided Republican gains
thakit is idle to seek for local causea
to account for the realt. In truth
this country is Republican, just as
it was Democratic for the thirty
years previous to the election of
Buchanan. During that long peri
od occasional convulsion of popular
feeling would result in the election
of a Whig President, but the sub
stantial control of the nation re
mained in the hands of the Demo
erate, if not in the perr n -of a chief
magistrate of their choice, then by
the control of the Senate and House
and of the large majority of the
States. But in Bnchanan's presiden
cy a great change came over the
spirit of this people, and during the
war, as well as since then, it has
been unmistakably Republican. Die
content with the administration or
local causes may have produced oc
casional disatisfaction in the rank
and file of the party, but normally
the country will swing back to its
Republican moorings when disturb
ing causes cease to operate. The
elections yesterday, and other re
cent State contests, show Ahat the
Republicans can control the bulk of
the Northern States, and the ma
jority of the electoral vote. if they
make reasonably good nominations
and introduce no party heresies into
their platform. The returns show
that in Minnesota and Wisconsin, as
well as New Yoik and New Jersey,
there has been a large accession of
popular votes to the republicans;
and it seems that, if no mistakes are
committed by the administration,
that organization is morally sus to
carry the next presidential election.
The issues are shaping themselves
for the Presidenial campaign. By
the force of circumstances the Re
publican party is the party of re
sumptio and .honest money, while
the Democratic party, to make an
isswe, will be* compelled in some way
to take a contrary position. There
is no doubt but what the school
question has much to do with the
increase of the Republican vote.
