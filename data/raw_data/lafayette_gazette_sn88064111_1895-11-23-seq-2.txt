A PLAIN BOLZT.
F ]our members of the 'demo~atic
Parish Exectave Committee, Messrs.
D. A. , Cochrane, Adrien Labbe,
"- Foustin Vincent aqd Numa Martin.
have bolted that organization. Mr.
Vincent was at the meeting by proxy
Sto Mr. D. A. Cochrane and Mr.
Martin by proxy to Mr. W. B.
Torian and it is in reality Messrs.
Torian and Cochrane who bolted
tb and not those from whom they held
°' proxies.
We were at the meeting and lis
tened to the ridiculous arguments of
the bolters and we believe that a
bolt was premeditated. It was plainly
a evident from the outset that their
co program was to withdraw from the
M7 meeting, knowing that being in the
minority they could not run things
r* with a high hand. They went there
to rule or ruin; they could not
rule and they bolted. Good Dem
pri- ocrats don't go back on their party
*; for so trivial a reason as the one of
fered by the bolters in justification
of their action. They have the
magnificent nerve to tell us that they
the bolted because the majority thought
co- proper and was determined to hold
one white Democratic primary to
select delegates to the State and ju
dicial conventions and to nominate
for candidates for parish and ward offi
ite cers, and they have the refreshing I
] gall to coolly inform us that such a
rt- course is undemocratic and unfair
m- and a sufficient cause for a bolt. If
Democrats are to bolt simply be
cause of a difference of opinion we
'C would like to know what will be
i. come of the Democratic party. If a
a mere matter of opinion as to hold- I
ing one or two primaries for the se- f
rdlection of candidates and delegates f
ri- is a cause for disruption of the '
party, party organization is impos- c
- sible.
a Just because the majority of the t,
t. members of the committe did not a
e agree with them on the question of 0
holding one or two primaries the
. four bolting members did not hesi- Y
if tate to withdraw from the meeting.
it They have gone square back on the
party for which they profess undy- ti
ing love and in whose principles E
they affirm abiding faith. They are
, guilty of a :bolt, pure and simple. L
,f They have shown by their action a]
that they don't care a snap for the ai
Democratic party and are willing to a
split it in twain if they cannot run b'
it to suit their peculiar views. They c
have established beyond the shadow d
' of a doubt the fact that with them cl
party unity are only catch-words to bi
e capture the unwary. They have ci
I served notice on the Democracy of
Lafayette that if they can not rule ei
e it it is their intention to ruin it regard- in
less of the dire consequences that to
will follow its disruption. Probably G
they felt their weakness among the w
Democratic voters and they bolted bi
knowing full well that they have not be
I the ghost of a show within the Dem- M
ocratic ranks and their only chance sa
lies in the disunion of the party for
the accomplishment of which they ar
have made their first outward move. St
They may prate about their Democ- ev
racy until doom's day but it will be en
a long time before they can satis- w"
factorily explain their action in this of
matter. When a man loves a party pr
he does not help to destroy it, and pa
when a man believes in principles di<
he does not assist in their annihila- di;
tion. an
It is safe to say, however, that sel
the Democrats of Lafayette will kn
readily understand the motives we
which have actuated these gentle- we
men in bolting the regular party or- thi
ganization and we are very much bu
mistaken if they are not severely go
reprimahded in a way that they will thi
feel keenly. In the mean time le. ha
them go on with their little side- "c
show. The people can not be
hoodwinked by men who bolt a Ne
meetii g because they are in a mi- m"c
nority. It may be more congenial anl
to them to have a committee of Mr
their own where they can meet, and "I
unhindered by molestation of a Re
majority, they can read long dis- die
quisitions on political bosses and be,
the ungratefulness of Republics in ant
general and Lafayette parish in par- it.'

srs. l rom a special fo. Baton Rouge
be, oi the TimelDemo rat, it is learned
rtin. that state tommissiofer of Agri
fr. culture A. V. Carter has issued a
Dxy circular letter to the Police Juries of
r. the different parishes of the State,
B. requesting that at -least two dele
irs. gates be appointed from each par
ted ish to meet and form a part of the
eld State Agricultural Society, which
convenes in this city on the fourth
lis- Wednesday in January next.
of Mr. Carter says that this associa
t a tion is doing much good for the
aly State. It affords a means of bring
eir ing together the cotton and rice
the planters and the rice and cotton
the producers, who attend the annual
igs meeting, and are given an oppor
ere tunity to intelligently discuss the
Lot methods that best subserve the in
m- terests of agriculture. At these
rty meetings there is a free exchange of
ff. views which adds no little to the de
on velopment of the agricultural re
he sources of the State. Mr. Carter
ey is of the opinion that yearly gather
,ht ings of the farmers and planters are
ild instructive not only from an agri
to cultural- standpoint, but tend to
u. make the people more united in
ate their efforts to develop the manifold
j-. resources of Louisiana, and are cre
ag ating a pride of citizenship hereto
a fore almost unknown. He further
tir expresses the opinion that the State
If should lend its aid and assistance by
e- making a small appropriation to de- I
re fray the railroad expenses of duly
e- accredited delegates to these annual
If meetings, as all such meetings are 1
I- purely agricultural and absolutely
e- free from any factional or political
es feeling, having but one object in
Le view-the development of the agri- t
s- cultural interests of the State. Com- 1
missioner Carter speaks enthusias- c
1e tically of the agricultural outlook E
)t and predicts a bright and prosper
of ous future for Louisiana. r

"BABY-DASHERS." ti
le At a recent meeting of the Chris- n
- tian Workers, at New Haven, Mrs. A
s Edwin Poteat, a reformer of the S
.e four-ply type, said she would rather
send her boys to hell than to Yale
University. Such statements are
n always made by people with kinks C
e and tangles in their heads, and with to
Da marvelous facility for changing ti
base and exposing their inconsisten
cy and crankiness. During the last st
V State campaign there were men who aj
v declared that they would take their in
a children by the heels and dash the C
o brains of the infants out against a D
e curbstone before they would cast a
vote for that pure and true man tr
Samuel D. McEnery, yet nearly ga
e every one of the baby-dashers were nE
in the movement a short time ago "
t to have Judge McEnery run against ,
Gov. Foster. There are a great
many people in this country who
would be wise If they took a dose of th
I bromide of potassium thirty minutes th
t before they commenced to talk, and F<
Mrs. Poteat is one of those nervous
souls.
The foregoing sensible remarks
are taken from The New Orleans
States. Our able contemporary is in
evidently corsect in the opinion it de
entertains of that class of people us
who never fail to make large asses ta
of themselves upon the slightest ba
provocation. The last State cam- er
paign in Louisiana afforded a splen- so
did opportunity to some people to to
display their abnormal patriotism ri
and how well they availed them- Ju
selves of that opportunity is well- or
known to our readers. Of course, Ni
we make no allusion to those who -
were honest and sincere and had
the courage of their convictions,
but we mean the vociferous dema
gogues who always try to impress
the people with the fact that they
have a monopoly on virtue and a
"corner" on purity.

It is as clear as the noonday sun
that the gentlemen who bolted the
Democratic meeting at the court
house went there with the intention
to withdraw if they did not succeed
in running everything to suit them
selves.
