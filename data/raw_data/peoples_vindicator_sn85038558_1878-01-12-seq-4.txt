Olive Logan writes. "It is really tak
the fact that jaunty English girls are the
now raising the hat by way of ac- loo
knowledging a bow, the same as the the
gentlemen do. The hat used is the ed;
little round felt Oxford, which looks loo
well enough on top of a pretty youcg gel
face, but is a powerfully hard-looking tec
affair on the poll of a woman who hot
ranks in that large and increasing as
army of 'has beens.' " tur

Jennie June says that Christmas
mince-pies require to be made by aA
pervon of large, liberal hleart and
mind, who is in sympathy with the
season, and appreciates all the signi- c
ficance and infinite possibilities of the te
dish she is compounding. No care- st
less hand should be allowed to touch Il
a single one of the ingredients, for si
upon their perfect preservation and pi
equal distribution depend the harmo- tl
ny of the whole. m

Speaking of the Moffett Register,
thie State Auditor of Virginia says : b
"Judging of tile future by the par
tial returns of the last few weeks, ci
feel safe in expressing tile opinionI el
that a half million dollars of revenue ec
derived from it will fall rather below t(
than exceed tile amount that a fair tl
year's trork trill yield. I have reason 9
to believe tihat an effort will be made '
to repeal this act. I trust it will not "
succeed. Revenue must be Ihad from b
some quarter, or tile State becomes tl
bankrupt. Shall it be raised from an
increased rate of the tax on property ? b
This can hardly ibe expected nor, in
deed, do I think it necessary. Shall
it be fiom a tax on oysters ? Some
thing, it is true, might be raised friom
this subject, but this, in my opinion,
is unnecessary if we can obtain the
revenue by a tax on the consumption
of liquor. This has been the great ob- t
jective point of successive genetal a
assenmblies, and of all persons who t
have carefully considered the finan
cial condition of thie State. This hl.s o
now been accomplished. The Mlof.
fet register has soired the difficulty. Let a
us give it a tfair trial for one year. If 5
it succeeds, well;if not then modi- j
fy or repeail it. I feel well assured t
that if the question were submitted a
to a vote of the people whether rev- I
enueo-shall be raised by a tax on prop
erty or a tax onr the consumption of f
liquor, thle preponderance of votesin I
favor of the latter plan would be at
least ten to one. I hope theact will
not be repealed."
Beauregard and Early.
Colfax Chronicle.
Why Dave C. Johnson or any other
man has not the same right to bet
upon any number that is in the great
gambling wheel of Chas. T. Howard
as to bet upon a horse race or the
state of the weather we fail to see.
But David hid a $25 fine to pay or
go to jail; and thus Charles T. is
made happy and continues to grind
.his swindhlng machine.
It is about time that monstrosity,
the Louisiana State Lottery, was
wiped out of existence. How is that
Howard can imprison any one who
imitates or practices his swindle
game? The act that enables him to
do so is undoubtedly unconstitution
al, and is a disgrace to the State. We
trust enough manhood will be found
in the Legisluture to rid us of the
iungur.

It is an interesting study to con
sidetr the various 1leeds of fowls anl
note their origin. Their names arise 1'
fintl some other peculiarity ill thei.r
form or appendage. For instance
the DI)oklings are named after Dork- 0
ing, in En]gland ; the Black Spanish,
or, as they are otherwise kniown, A
evterhisting layers, after S ,pini, the dir
Polands caine from Poland; the tcis,
I loudains (pronounced Hloudon), from
lonilhdin, France; the Shanghais are D)RT
named after Shanghai in China; the
lIntf ani Pat tide Cochin, Chinas also
take their name from Cochin, China;
thlie Siberia or Russian fowls, fromit
lissia; lhi Mayhlys, Jalva, Colun
hians,, liarlo t s, Dutch fowl.~, all
'from their respective countries. There
are also the (Guilders, from (Gnuiler

,r cover with earth, a few inches thick

d freezes, so as to be proof against fiost. 811
t- When some of the roots are wanted
º- in winter, go to the heap on a mild L
day and open one end carefully, and
take out a load of them, then replace
re the straw and bring enough more
. loose straw or poor hay to protect
ie the roots front ftost at the end open- «'

is load of roots, remove the straw and
g get them. It would be well to pro
tect this straw from rain by placing
t boards against it. Carrots stand first
as food for cows, next beans, theu no
turn.ips. Horses that ate not worked c
Smuch will keep in fine condition on
e hay and carrots, with a little grain
- when worked. It seems to me that
any fartmer who has no roots to feed
Iris stock, from now on through the
winter, is in a very poor condition as GI

my farmer renders have failed to
i grow any roots this season, I earnest

a A Novel Way of Making Jelly Cake.
d Take the whites of six eggs, one
ni- cup of white sugar, samne of flour, one -
he teaspoonful of butter, two table
re- spoonifuls of sweet milk, two tea
Ichi slpoonfuls cream of tartar antl one of
for soda. Bake in a large oblong, drip
nd Iping pan, so the cake will be very
to- tlhin; meanwhile stir another batch,
making just thie same, with thIe ex
ception of using the yolks insteaid of
the whites; when both are done,
spread when warm with jelly, or pre
er, serves of any kind; put together,
S bring the largest side of the cake to
ar ward you, and roll immediately, or
cut in four or eight parts, put togeth
it er alternately, putting jelly between
tue each layer, and frost lightly over the
o top. Another method is to make
jair three pans, maniking the third layer
so of one-thild red-sand sugar, proceed
Ide ing the sanme as for the othlier layeis; I

'om To Breed Pigs Successfully,
on, From the experience of successful
tion swine breeders it is pretty well es
ob- tablished that to keep pigs growing
al and thrifty all winter, it is important
vho to give them a dry, warm place to
an. sleep; good drink, either warm slop
has or fieslh pumped water; and to keep
of not too many hogs in an enclosure,
Let and they as nearly as possible of a
Jf size. If you have large and small to
di- gether, the big ones will run over
red the little, and they will not get their
tted share of food. There is much more
rev- danger of cholera or epidemic diseases
op where the conditions mentioned
of above are disregarded than where
hs Inogs are kopt thrifty and growing,
at and certainly there is more profit. A
will dry warm bed is a cheap hIxury for
hogs in winter, and every farmer
should prepare a shed and plenty of
material in the fall.
Cocoanut Cake.-One-half cupful
ther butter, one cupful sugar, one-half
bet cupful sweet milk, two cupfuls flour,
rent two teaspoonfuls baking powder, salt,
