SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Dec. 27.- The
subject uppermost in the minds of the
people of the whole island and partictl
larly those in the provi&,ces of Santiago
and Puerto Principe is the news that
the building of the new C'uban railroad
connecting Santiago wit]h the western
part of the island is a certdinty.
Sir William Van Horne, president of
the Canadian Pacific railroad and noted

OOV"RxOR ENZRLL" LEROiARD WOOD.
as a promoter of extensive transporta
tion schemes, has recently been in Cu
ha inspecting possible routes in the
Santiago province, and be stated just
before leaving that the settlement of a
few minor details would start active
work on the enterprise. It will be a
unique undertaking. As a franchise
cannot be obtained until the ApDsrlcan
military occupation ends and g civil
government established it has been
necessary for the company, which
holds a charter from the state of New
Jersey, to buy land for Its right of way
from individual owners. Whether the
company after laying rails and building
stations will be able to operate the line
for public purposes is a question which
must rest in abeyance for the present
The road is to be built east from San
tlago to Baracoa, the town which the
Spaniards founded near Cape Maysl
early in the sixteenth century, and
west to Santa Clara, at which point
connection can be made with the rall
road system of western Cuba. The on
1 oflcial railroads in the province of
Santiago today ares freight line owned'
sby an iron company running from Dal
,uirl to Santiago and a passenger ard
freIght line connecting Palma Soriano
In the Interior with Santiago by way of
San Luis, El Cristo and Boniato. The
Jiat Is perhaps 20 miles in length, and
the other is not more than 40.
Sir William predicts that Cabs d111
abecome the American Riviera. Heaiys
signifcantly that be has seen places
that were deserts compared with east.
ern Cuba become productive and profit
able. Ninety per cent of the people, in
blh opinion, want peace and a" chance
to develop the island. Ohe has only to
read the journals of Columbus to know
that eastern Cuba is a paradise. There
has been comparatively. little change
since his day. The Spaniards were
content with path., and trails. Evex,
the Road of the Kain, which skirted
the coast near Santiago, was a: poor
dirt road, Impasable after rain."'
A man who i materially aidling the
mew railroad scheme is Santiago Rows
eanu, a wealthy planter. Rousseau, a
Frenchan a y birth, but who came to
Cuba-many tears ago, la the owner of
tremendous tracts of land lying direct
ly in the path to be followed by the.
projected railroad. He has offered to
sdeed the use of certain parts of his
property to the company free of charge.
The Cuban constitutional convention
'am Havana is continuing its work In
rather a desultory manner. The friends
of General Maximo Gomes are using
their Influence to have a clause Insert
ed in the constitution 'providing that
any one who fought in the revolution
shall be eligible for the presidency. A
new paper has been started in which
,the principal opponents of the clause
are described as enemies of General
Gomes. Some of the delegates who are
endeavoring to Introduce such a clause
declare that they are doing so as a mat- '
ter of principle and that General Go
mes does not enter into the proposition.
The prevailing opinion is that those
who vote for the introduction of the '
clause will do so because of a desire
to see the valiant warrior made presi
'dent The teachers at the capital are
somewhat concerned as to the future
of Superintendent of Schools Frye and
his fiancee, who is a Cuban. Their in
terest in the matter led to the idea of
asking Governor General Wood to ap
point Mr. F"rye commissioner of schools
Instead of Senor Forrero, a Cuban, but
this plan was dropped.
Secretary of Agriculture l.:wusto has
appointed four agricultural improve- i
wnent committees, two for Santa Clara
gnd one e'ach for Santiago a1nl Puerto ?
Principe. 'l$ese committees will act as
distributes anl supervisors of the cat
tie a hich are experte td to arrive short
ly. lThe .'atrtl will IC sold to poor ,
peasants on easy terms. payments to be
made in from 15S to 20 months. TheyF
will be branded and numbered. The
veterans at Sancti Spiritus. where one
of the committees will be located. have I
protested against the appointment of a
an ex-soldier of the Spanish army uas a'
derogatory to Cuban dignity. Senor
Lacoste refuses to remove the man in
questioa.
Major Ladd, treasurer .of the island,
has offered for sale $7)O,000 in Spanish
geld. The lowest price that will be ac
cepted is 109'a. The buyers will have
a month in which to pay for their pur
chasts. Major Ladd says that he has
shipped $10.00).0U) In Spanish gold to
the United States to be remelted. The
treasury, however, kses by this opera
tion. Owing to the approcching crop
harvesting the planters need money,
and they all want Spanish gold. Con
sequently Major Ladd offers what the
treasury has on hand in order to relieve
the demand. HIAYs Du BoisE.

THE ISLAND OF CORFU.

[Special Correspondence.]
ISLAND OF CoIF.U Dec. 1.--You can
have no idea what a beautiful spot this
is, with its blue Gr.cian skies and its
still bluer waters. We are waiting for
Mr. Leland's yacht, which is to take
us on a short cruise around the island.
You know that Corfu is the great re
sort for winter yachting. The sail and
steam boats begin to come in as early
as November, so that now the season
is at its height. A great many British
navy officers are to be found here. I
understand they prefer this island to
any other station in the Mediterranean
because shooting and cricket can be
obtained, and the hard, smooth roads
afford excellent opportunities for cy
cling. As far as the shooting is con
cerned, it is excellent. We are not far
from Epirus, famed for its wild boar,
deer, woodcock and snipe.
Yesterday the three of us-Mrs. Le
land. Maisle and I-took a drive to the
famous Achilleon. Just fancy it!
Awhile ago there was a plan on foot to
change this into a gambling establish
ment What desecration that would
have been! Fortunately the emperor
of Austria Interfered, and it now re
mains as formerly, an imperial resi
dence. The drive home was one never
to be forgotten. Maisie pulled out her
sketchbook and her little tin box of
water colors and tried to catch the ef
fect of tte sunset on the water. We
are used to these outbursts of artistic
feeling on her part, so no one minded,
although the Jolting of the carriage
threatened to upset her little water can
at every minute.
All the way along our eyes were de
lighted by picturesque bits-old ruins,
moss grown'rocks, rare plants and foll
age and the country people themselves
clad In their bright costumes' which i
have never been:the least bit tatered
since the days of their great-grandfa
thers. The women are as a rule beau-1
tifuL In some cases they resemble an-'
dent statues. They wear their hblt
dressed over, very thick pads, the two
long plaits being adorned with scarlet
ribbon crossed and tied behind on the
nape of the neck. The ends are flow
Ing and visible under the gauze or mus
lin bolla, which, edged with blond or

The plaited skirt Ia made of shot silk or
white muslil for grand occasions and

ribbons for ordinary day wear. Blue

apron, which Is. of flowered silk in
bright hues or of bomelv chintz, while
the gala dress velvet Jacket. worn over
a silk corselet, fastened with silver but
tons, Is gorgeously embroidered and al
most covered with gold. Two pairs of
long golden earrings well nigh pull the
ears out of shiape, and gold chains,
large crosses and medals cover the
breast Each finger, moreover, Is
adorned with quaint rings.
The men's costumes are composed of
dark blue cotton baggy trousers, white
or black stockings and a dark waist
coat finished off with gold braid and
sometimes fastened with large silver
buttons. The black jacket is jauntily
thrown over one shoulder, and a scar
let fez with blue tassel completes the
dress.
The Princess of Wales and her
daughters stopped here in the spring,
and they were delighted with the old
world atmosphere and the quaint town.

She 6th of January and Its Poplatr
Phrase For Good Luck.
T.ast year developed quite a fad
among the fashionables for Twelfth
Night parties. Twelfth (lay, or 'Old
('hristmas" day, is the 6th day of Jan
uary. or 12 days after Christmas Ec
clesiastically. It is the Epiphany, or
'appearance," and commemorates the
coming of the three 'star led magi"
to Bethlehem. Down to the time of
the civil wars In England Twelfth day
was kept with great festivity at court,
among the nobility. in the barristers'
inns, at the universities and among
the people generally. The lord mayor
of London, accompanied by the alder
men and the city guilds, used to attend
St. Paul's and hear a sermon. Large,
elaborate cakes were made in which
a bean was inserted, and he who ob
tained the slice containing the bean
was recognized as "king for the day."
The custom is traced back beyond
Christian times to the old RIoman days.
when children, at the end of their
saturnalia. drew lots with beans for
thte honor of kingship. It gave rise to
a proverb Indicative of good lu:-:-"He
has found the bean!"
Mary, queen of Scots, It Is on record,
took part in Twelfth Night festivities
at Iolyrood in 1563, and when the
bean fell to the lot of her attendant,
Mary Fleming, the queen good natur
edly arrayed the lady in her own robes
and jewels.
Tile custom is still kept up in France,
where, indeed, the popular phrase for
good luck is, "11 a trouve le feve an
gateau" ("tie has found the bean in
the cake.", One cf these cakes is cut
up every Twelfth Night in the green
room at Drury Lane theater In accord
ance with a bequest by Iladdeley, the
comedian, to provide cake and wine on
this particular night for the perform
ers. Twelfth Night is a great time In
Rome. The people there call it Befana,
a contraction of Epifania. Befana is
their Santa Claus. He brings all the
children their sweets and their toys.
On this night the youngsters sally
forth with long tin trumpets to the toy
bazaar, making a din indescribable,
and finally return to hang up their
stockings.
The present Twelfth Night festivrties
Include adaptations of some of the old
customs and the cutting of the cake,:
for which any good fruit cake recipe
will serve, with the addition of a bean
dropped into the mixture just before
It is put into the oven.
