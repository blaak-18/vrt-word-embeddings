four little boys to support. Music was

did not leave it off when she was mar

faced the future with her four boys
around her and only her dauntless will
and her knowledge of music between
all of them and homnelessness or de
pendence on charity. At first she
taught piano music and played for
evening entertainments wherever she
could get engagements. She was also
pianist for an orchestra. Then she de

For generations Un i- and women
artists have painted from the nude in
the same classes in I'aris. and nothing
evil has been thought of it. Lately a
private studio was opened in Berlin in
which the same practice was inaugu
rated. The German police. interfered
and demanded either the closing of the
studio or the separation of the art stu
dents along the sex line. The edict was
pbeyed for awhile. Then matters slid
back as they had been. 'A.nd th$ st"'t
dents pairted in the same class. The
preceptor was of the highest rank; the
students were men and women with--I
out exception enthusiasts in their task.
This time, although the authorities
must have beet aware of the infrac
tion of their order, the studio was not
interfered with.

Somethtng About the New Materialt.
Gownn and tVaistm.
Of all the old fashioned dress stuffs
nothing is daintier or prettier titan
challie. The manufctuirers h:v t .vi
dently thought so, for the st(;res are
full of the material in over 40( differ
eat designs. Some of them have the
satin stripe over the surface. the latter

but instead delicate weaving. like lace.
But, no matter what the design is or
its complications, the soft and flexible
quality of the challie remains. Per

signs is that in which the old pompa

season, some dark a)d some even with
black groundwork. But the dainty and
pretty flowers are perfect, each after
its kind, looking like tiny roses or other
blossoms. Among the designs brought
out in the challies are, lbesides the flo
-ra patterns, Persians, dresdens and
escurials on light or datlk grounds.
Some of the challics have a regular
crape twist, which makes ,them hang
like china crlape. They are to be made
into te: gowns as well as other house
dresses. :ind it is even said that they

Sipeaking of tea gowns reminds me
that there is a great revival in the pop
ularity of tlese graceful if somewhat
careless garments. I mean that the
tea gowns are ralther negligee, though
OWhy:co0t erough to be full dress. with
tLamoitds thrown in. They are loose
and long and son:dhow create the idea
that the wearer is makin herself com
fortable, and we all know tuhat no wo
man has the right to do that "in com
pany." Still. the lea gown is here and
will stay.
The tea gowns of tis seasoll are 111n
differently of surai, liberty, voile. crepe
de chine, poplin, albatross clothi. cash
mere. drap d'ete. ipane. chiffon over
silk, challie and itndlia silk. Billows of
lace are il;tce.d wvhcrever the fertile
mind of a dressmaker can imagine it,
and there are insets. Applications and
more ways and kinds of lace trim
mings than i can remember. All the
skirts are made into such tluffs of ruf
ties with rut-e-s of chliii'on on the edges
that the bottom sets out in the most
approved fashion. Ribbon is put on in
many ways. even to being added in the
form of "love knots" at one shoulder
or another.
Most of the very fine tea gowns are
of china crape in pink. blue or some of
the delicate pastel shades which are
back among this season's colors. Many
have Irish crochet lace boleros, and
others show deep sailor collars of fine
mousseline with an overlay of rich
lace.. Others have deep yokes made of
heavy renaissance lace, and, in fact,
one can ha\e anything one wants in
the line of tea gowns. Only the long,
loose shape is preserved.
Shirt waists and other separate waists
are still with us and are likely to re
main. Generally speaking. they do
not vary much from those of last year.
The principal thing to note about them
is the exceedingly ugly and awkward
sleeve. All the sleeves are built more
or less on the same lines and are cum
bersome and baggy at the bottom an~
made snug at the top. Most oftel tbh'
is done by having the top laid in tucks
or folds. A f w years ago we had the
"leg o' muttod" sleeves, and they were
very ugly. but they only interfered
with the comfort of your neighbor,
while these bother the wearer most
miserably. They get into the soup and
catch on everything and are not even
pretty. Can any one account for the
vagaries of women's fancies? I cannot.
Plaid silk is quite a fad for waists,
and the woman whose wardrobe lacks

commiserated." All plaid silk or wool

of the different kinds I have had to

who manages you. who tells you how
to do your hair, how to walk, how to
think and how to breathe, and she and
you get along all right as long as you
do exactly as shte says.

"Fifth.-Then there's the friend who

is. who says when she hears you know

"B't. my dear." ejaculated the mar

It is said that Bialzac detested Dumas.
Once he brought to the Siecle the man
uscript of a novel. which was to follow
"Les Trois Mousqlnetaires," then being
published. IIe asked to be paid 2;,
francs a line. The.director of the jour
nal hesitated. "You see. M1. Dumas is
being paid only 2 francs aline." "'f
you are giving 2 francs to that negro,
I shall get out!" And Ralzac stalked
off.
Dumas was not ignorant of Bttlzac's
feelings toward him and did not spare
him. In the foyer of the Odeon theater
Balzac was talking loudly in a group
of literary men. W'hen I have written
myself out as a novelist. I shall go to
playwriting." "You can begin right
away," called out Dumas.
An Arabian Story.
An Arab and his wife were constant

went straightway to her father and
made complaint. One day the Arab
boxed the ears of his better half.
whereupon she went again td her fa

manding revenge. The father, a wise
old sheik, shook his head, and. after
long reflection, boxed his daughter's
ears and said: "Now thou art avenged..
