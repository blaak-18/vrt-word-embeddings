Now to Secure an Hemest Elee
lion.
We have never had an honest
election in New Orleans, except w
when the opposition was repre
sented by commissioners, and we ti
will not have one.-Times-Demo- hi
crat. 1s
If that is so in New Orleans, it
must be equally true in the coun- el
try parishes. f(
It comes as a shock to many vo- tl
ters to see the board, composed p
wholly of Democrats, and repre
senting, in this matter, the Demo
cratic party, giving a ruling which w
every one who remembers aught of g
our past elections knows will as- el
Ssure the same gross frauds which
have disgraced this city in the past. lý
-Times-Democrat.
If it is a shock to every sense
of right and decency in politics in
New Orleans, it is equally demor- r
: alizing and disgusting to country
democrats who love justice and
fair dealing.
It is knowledge of these facts l
, which has so wrought up the peo- d
' ple, which has made the situation a
so serious, and which threatens in- o
jury to the Democratic State tick- Q
et.-Times-Democrat,
If the country boards of super
visors refuse representation to the
People's party, in plain violation
of the law and as the T.-D. says,
in the interest of the same gross
frauds which have disgraced as in
the past, it will work up the right
eau indignation of the people and
bring stll greater and disgraceful
defeat to the Democratic State and
!ecal tickets.
It is to be hoped that reason will
reaeert itself, and that an earnest
efort will be made to smooth away
differences which will tend to the
reat injury of the Democratic
ticket. Those who use their
power or call on the techmicalities
of the law to prevent am honest
election take a grave responsibillty
on their shoulders, sad will severe
ly injure the case they are claim
ing toel.--Times-Democrat.
It is to be boped that reason will
not lom its away in the country
parishes as it did l the city of
New Orleans, and that the law will
be opled with in the interest of
mres sad justie.
For otwithstanding the fact that 1
, the Dmoeatie party would lose
strength, and its opposition gain1
by it, it would be at the sacriloe
ot pease and good will of marv of
l. our people, and perhbps more se
rious ceoequems.
While we know that*the parish
boards of Supervsors have in ma
y i tances rbees changed, and
that too, whem the old boards had
gives fair and hoesmt electioes in
the past, and thus satisfed all boo
eat people, amd these changes may
diee a desire to change from
these honest lectioms, yet we hope
that oseer. who control these
age w- s tha te ., ad the
awterests of their party, will be
the maserer i the nd, ad d decie

White Supremacists. il
Na
Our Democratic friends in this To
parish refused a white primary
which would have settled the ques
tion, of "which white men should
have the offices," in a peaceable,
law-abiding manner.
To ease their consciences, how- p,
ever, and to excuse themselves be- Ni
fore the public, they came back at Ni
the Populists with a type-written pl
proposition to divide the election of
officers half and half, if said Pops wi
would join them in preventing ne- an
grees from voting at the general or
election. Ni
This being a violation of the in
law sufficient to vitiate the election all
if carried out, some of the Pops isl
"smelled a very large mice" and to
refused to go into it. 21
We presume the Democratic par
ish committee will get out a circu- of
lar letter antd send a million cop- p
pies of it over the parish, as they y
did Pharr's statement a few weeks
ago, that he had worked along-side i,
of a negro, as has most every other bl
Southern man who has worked at
all.
The Democrats of this parish ,
are in favor of fair elections and
want to comply with the law bear
ing upon same, but their leaders
want to get all the concessions pos
sible from the Pops, before they T
do it.
Correct, go ahead.
The suffrage amendment was S
I suggested by Democrats; it was as
t enacted by a Democratic Legisla- y
V ture; it was endorsed by the Dem
e ocratic State Convention; it is q
C therefore a party measure, and ei
r Governor Foster and his adminis
s tration are pledged to its support.
t --Shreveport Caucasian.
Y The Daily Item of New Orleans,
has very properly designated the
Foster campaign, "a eampaign of
U spots."
y The above clipping is from the
if Caddo "spot." Last week we
II gave our readers a "spot" from)
if Red River, to-wit: I
Our last Legislature, impelled
t by the cry for ballot reform that
was at that time sweeping the t
nState, submitted this proposition u
I to the people. They are i no way
* responsible for it. In fact, the
f great majority of them wil vote I
_ against it. So will the democrats
of this parish vote a the r
amendment. C ts emcatt.
h Harmonious and beautiful con
sisteuy
These two "spots" are in adljoin
ilag parishes, ad only demonstrate
how completely the house is divi
ded against itelf.
y We are inclined, however, to
sustain the position of the Caucas
SIa, as to the responsiblity of the
Democratic party for the suffrage
J smeudment, and we believe those
Sain favor of it should support the
lparty which fathered it, and those
,opposed to it should vote against
' the Democratic party.,
ar Some of our people may not
know that a vote for either of the
- Demnocratic nominees for repre
'" sentative In this paish, is a vote
for Bisaclbrd.

Perhaps it is impossible for you
to have a meeting of the Board of

question of granting Commission
kers to the Populist party.
Hoping for an early reply,
I remain very truly yours,

Populists, NNotice.
On account of Small Pox and
the tonsequent quarantine's the
Populist candidates and speakers
for both State and local ofces,
have been unable to fill any of
their appointments in this parish.
Hence it is of the utmost im
portancsae that all Populist clubs in
the parish meet on Saturday,
April 4th, at their respective pla
ces of meeting and take charge of
the esmpaign at their several pre
cincts, and meet each baturday
thereafter, and be is good working
order, ready to take up any work 4
assigned to them in reference to
the campaign, appointment of com
missioners, watchers of election,
distribution of tickets, ete.
Your work for the last four
years depends for success on your
prompt, eSolet and patriotic s
tion, for the remaining 3 weeks of
the campaign.
Do not fal.
8MA'L. J. HENRY,
Chairman, Cam. Com.
The Editor of this paper regrets
very much that Messrs. Breassele
and Henry have entered into per- I
seaslties in this campaign. We
hoped that this would be a cam
pin conducted on argument, and
arjsorry we are compelled to pub
lish the letters of Messrs. Brea
seale and Henry. However, Mr.
Bresuesle's letter was in reply to a
olcial communication of Mr.
Henry, who represented the Peo
ple's party of the parish of Natch
itoches, and of course, it was our
duty to publish same, u the letter
wOO discourteous to Mr. Henry
amnd the People's party, we conce
"ded to Mr. Henry the right in our
columas to answer Mr. Breazeale.
It took a Shreveport paper to
inform us that Natchitobes would
furnish a democratic majority.
The woods are full of just such
false p as he who furnished
the a that information.
Natehitoches is one parish where
we know no stuB~g will be done.
, We used to live an Natchitoches
and know whereof we speak.

Correct Kearney, old boy. The
I Democrats haven't voters enough
in this parish t' carry one ward
