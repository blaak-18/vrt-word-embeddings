Peace !!
P~rnns were sung in lovely cadence
in January last, which were echoed t
in the hearts of pll, and: expectation i
wa: rife that some rest wouli be had I
from the tonioil of Louisiana politics. I
Some hope was entertained, and p Ip
on good grounds too, that in future at
decent regard, at least.woulti be .paid. .
to the wi.shes and welfare of the tax
lmyer. Such, however, is not thel
case. Tire song was that of the siren, t
and we are lured to almost fatal' sl u- I
her. Peae is not !

A gentleman of our city, pomessing
as much, if not more, pohtical sianei.
ty than any person ii our parish, de-
claredl in the city of New Orleans to
those who favored the compromise,
that the result would be peace iii
those parishes Ienefited therely anit
war in those injured ; for ,the reason
that the parishes handed over to the
tender mercies of radical rulerg, would
be ground to the dist.
We are going to, get our share of
the grinding. process now, and it re,
mains to be seen hoit long the white
citizens will staund it.
Peace, to be lasting, mnst come with
the consent of the intelligent, which
can never be had unless some respect
is paid its wihesn. Mark our word,
there will be serious trouble i this
section and that at no distant day.

We have been informed by good
authority, that the leading .radicals

All we can say in the matter is, that

I'e -' not, "lhow4'¢er, aseribe any

and the fact of an anti-a:dministra

this "toleration," as the republicans
call the fait of hot killing denmons,
who come to niii'delr, a ~d' rob. may be
.very pretty in picture ; but we are of

f I.:ONA t ASKS TOO UIMTc.
The New IOrleans Republican re
plies fir Pl'ac ard to ihr. Leonard's
deimand of hian, that his party show
by "wotks,";not by "declarations,"
its faith, antil declare: that )Ir. L.
"asks too nmuch" of the radical party.
We were ell convinced of that fact
4t the time, Itom the past history of
the, party in this State and elsewhere.
The Republican party will promise as
ruchh, refornm at the nature of the situ
o ation require, and execute as little as
the empty pqckets of its followers will
Sadnmit-which we know is nothing.
This setst rest rest the yell of retrm
If we expect, it in Louisiana, small
o dependence Rhould be placed in Pack
ard and his Hiarty. Co-operation will
only lend a sh.ow of replectahility to
t thievery, not hing mor. Mr. Leonard
is, no dobhti now well satisfied that
Paeckard attimpted to deceive him
and no go¶ui can. be hoped for to the
people of thJ Ntate from any aflilia
tion with hii . Let us prepare oar
sehles for th struggle ; self-reliance is
our:main an heor-with that we will
surely sncced,
t, Much hcas ,cee written and said
i- about the Wheeler adjustment, and
p the questions settled thereby. We
e may be wrqng, bat the interpretation
it put upon this "Wheeler adjustment"
is by us, fromi information obtained at
q, the time of its discussion, from the
e gentlemen who favored the movement
)f was, that nothing was decided by its
ae acceptance save the status of Kel
io logg, as regarded his actions in con
re nection with the present' House of
Re Representatives; that it did not ef
i- feet the Louisiana case then before
Congress, is apparent from the fact,
c. that the Radicals elected to the pres
-. ent Congress, have secured the legal
my Governor, McEnery, certificates;
!k have thereby set the example of a
,n want of confidence in the legitimate
ir standing before the assembling Dem
S- ocratic House, of the Kellogg usur
id pation.
rt If Kellogg usurped. at all, he seized
,y the State government contrary to law;
,o contrary to the constitution and in
Dr violation of the rig its of free sub
at jects. .
ar Ie certainly did this, and no act
of a party, or partizan organization
d 1 can make the act binding or legal
L- for no one has the right, legally or
to otherwise, to decide the case, save
1r the people themselves interested.
The Congress of the United States
h has no power under the constitution
h to take cognizance of purely State
matters, nor can the legislature of a
p State declare who is the legal and
who is not the legal Governor. That
we conside~,as beyond their power.
The point at issue seems clear to
us that nothcing has yet been decided
t as to the legal qu:mlifications of Kel
e logg, he hl:s a tacit recognition, it is
true. Inst thlt is for an express punr
Spose and expressly stated. The
D )emocratic nnmcubers of Congress lhave
I but to seat the elected Congressmen
e of 1874, upon tihe McEnery certificates.
STliis act, taken in connection with
y the seating of Sheridan by the last
e IIouse and the refusal to admit Pinch
e back, recognizes thie AlcEnery Gov
er ernment, not only as dejure, but de
faco.
S All parties can rest assured that
'- the question will come up apd will be
t decided by thie re-instatement of the
r powers and rights of each contestent
Sas fonjud, when usurped by the Mili
tary iarm of the goverment-when
r! sueh is done, it will be quickly seen
Io who is Governor, MeEnery or Kiel

r. We can nw lhope for a nnited peo
pie. The Democratic Central Corn
s- mittee which was formed by thee Batoo
ir Rbuge Convention, has assumed eon
i trol, calling a convention for Wed
nesday, Janusary 5th, 1876. The New
Orleans I'imes yet says wo, should
id wait until later so as toknow "what
re the.Nationalparty willdb." Or sune
t- cess lias nothing to do with the
5 "Nstional afair, and in the language
, of Toodllea, "positively dem the Na
tional party" who ever it is.
a,,
,t . The Datoe evidently took Olhio the
i other day, if we are to take as gos
to pel waS the G. B. journals says of it.
SCanal frands in New York and
t reasury fiinds in Pennsylvania
don't give thie republieans time to
, talk currency much. McKay,: State
Streasnrei of Peonnsylvaonia, has been
proven to be a'bad thing.
SGen. Campbell (militia) has' been
met with much ,opposition in East
Felieisan. So far, the Bulleti noum
bers them 1 and 2. The first. was a
S"ussang" he received at Baton Rouge
and the second was the failure of
East Feliciana people to rushl into the
valiant hero's arms. A nice report
Campbell will get up.

y, Troops are no longer furnished-

taken to foot batlhs and warm tea.
The New Orleans Republican ihas
Sdiscovered that the Democratic con

Stirely toot~ina. Toiu can never Cover

that Iay--never.
Our Platform,
We ask our Louisiana frtiends to
consiler over this as a good sound
platformn of principlºes for our state iln
1876.
S'IAl'ITE.
I. Thlat the governmient now exis- t
tingr in L ouisiana originated in, anld
has Ihlen maintained by lorce mi .
fraud, in oppositionl to tlH will of at
Slarge n:iajoritvy of the voters of the
State ; ii, opposition to the principlesIl
of the (Constitution of thie United
States and in violation of every prin
ciple of justice and liberty.
2. Thalt the dominant faction of the
of the Radical party in this State has
by ftalse alUid f'nrlludelent representa
tions, inffiramed the i ipassions and pre
,judihes of the neg'ros, as a race,
aIfiilnst the whites, iand has thereby
nimade it necessuary for the wite peo
lilc to unite and nlot together in self
ilefenllse and the jpreservation of white
civilization.
3. Thlt thle rights of all nmen undler
tint Constitition anlld laws of the land
Iust be respected and preserved in
violate, irtestpective of nrace, color or
previous cinidition, but we deity that
Congress can Constitutionllallly enract
laws to tforce the two races into so
cial union or eqluaility.
4. Thl;tt thit white people of Lou's
ialina have noT desire to deprive the
colored people oiailily righrts to which
they iare entilled, but we are con
vincted that the reforims imperatively
deianitlled, ca'n be etlected only by
l electing to otlice white mien of known
capacity and integrity, to seciie It,
government which miust be benelicial
, alike to both races.
5. That the election and registra
t tion laws under which our elections
e are to be conducted were inteuded to
t perpetuate the nsutrprition by depri
ving the people and especially our
naturalized citizens of anr opportuni
ty to register and voNe, but we all
- notnice, distinctly, that it is the de
f terzmination of the people to hare a
fair and free election and to see that
the result is not changed by fraud or
e violence.
, . That we extend to our race in
every clinic the right band" offellow
srhip and a coldial invitation to come
and .cttle among us, and unite their
destinies with ours.
a 7. That while we are in favor of
e meeting punctually the pays.ent of
the legitimnate debt of Louisiana,. we
are inimovabty opposed to the recog
nitions isMiet in tihe name of the State,
aind we pledge ourselves to make a
1 searching iuvestigatioa in the matter.
;IATIONAL.
a First-The restoration of gold and
sliver as tihe basis of the curren
cy:; the resumition of specie pay
nlents as soon as possible without dis
t aster to thie l)siness of the country,
a by steadily opposing inflation, and by
the payment of the national indebt
edness in the money of thle civilized
r worlMd.
e Second--Free eommer ; no tariff
for any purpose but for revenue.
S Third-Jnidividnal liberty and op
position to snmptnary l'aws.
Fourth-The right and iuitvy of the
e state to protect its citizenus fiot ex
a tortion and nnjnst discrimination' by
, chartered monopolies.
S Fifth.-Rigid restriction of tbe gv
ernnent, both state and nationat, to
thie legitimatedomain of'mliticalpnW
n er, by exclhdillg thlerfom all exeeutive
I 1and legislative intermedilinig with
the nfithirs of society, whereby mon
opolies are fostered, privileged elas.
sea aggrandized, and individual
- freedoml necessarily and oppressively
a restrained.
We neglected to mention last week
anything iln regard to the railroad.
It was a provoking oversight for
t lwhich we will try and make amends.
The advanced, surveying party, nn
der charge of Capt. Dabney, passed
through our city two weeks since and
have been bulsy since locating the
t correct ronte hence to Mansfield.
The line decided upon will cross
Jonnson's chute a short distance
Sabove its confluence with Bayou
Pierre, following up that stnegm at d
· between.it and Spanish lake."
S Capt.' Dabney is pushing matters
through witllh a vim. Maj. James,
Ssince our last, hras graded four and a
half miles of road, making nine miles
in all. So the work goes.bravely on.
A friend has favored us with the
