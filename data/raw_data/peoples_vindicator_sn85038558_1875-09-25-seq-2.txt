Patriots not Politicians.
The Mansfield Reporter falls into
line in condemnation of this early c
action with regard, to the formation
of political parties, bat, we think it
has goq too far, in thisdwidhoW y,
tlhat ofiabpIng poil.;ans, per cc.
When we come to consider the fact
of politicians as prTfessional; then
we agree with our able contemporary
in every respect. The great cause,
however, why our country is in its
present condition, is owing greatly to
the disgust of leading eitlspu fot a
long time refusing to have anything
to do with political matters at all,
from the fact that the professio al
trickster wire-worked and descended
to such acts as were, to the gentleman
and scholar, in polities, disgusting.
We see to what condition this with.
drawal of the representative :citiaen
from the arena, has reduced the eoms:
try. Our position can be elempiifod
by a study of the political history
of our own State for the past nine
years, and the grand formation made
last year, with the Baton Rouge Con
vention as the starting point.
ao one in Louisian has seen an
aamsauhinhle of =-'- --...* -4 .
wvhdie, to that Convention: no one
has *itsessed such self-sacrisice for
the good of State, than was there
manifested, and no one'can say that
the politicians, and when we say poli
ticians we mean. oji e eekcrs, were
not completely ignored. They had no
claims upon the memnhieto of the Con"
vention, and if not told so,mthe con
duct of the delegates as a .mass, was
such as to convince them of the fact,
that the People Iad at last taken the
matter in hand, and there was no op
portunity for the schemer to exercise
his vocation.
What we desire is, that all good
men shall continue in politics; that
we shall educate our children, not to
be politicians, but, to take an inter.
eat in public affairs alively and deep
interest I so that in the future, our
country will not be disgraced by such
legislation ; secl acts of thievery, as
have been exhibited during the past
tee years in Federal, as well as State
matters.
There are many men, we admit,
who are demogogues, in our: own
party; this we feel of course, grieved
at, but,. if we all should withdraw from
publie affairs, and leave the party
management to them, then we are no
better off, even if snccessful, than we
! would be with the Appoaitlon in pow
er.
All citisene are certainly ltesMted
in public sadrsa even in la ionetiry
sence, and eyeo If a simple vster, .be
desires sa well and honestly eseduted:

comslm, as ie wise, to keep watch

his IlWrels at tihe ballot box-to at.
tend the prinary orgkanizstiem, for the
outcome of the average politiian,
be he President, Congressmen, or
what, can be judged from tim start.
We hope the condition of Louisd.

In next week's issue we will publish
in full the letter of Attorney General II
Pierrepont, to Ames of Mississippi, 0
with relation to the call for troops, .
Grant has at last found out that the v
"!hele public is, tired of theeo ait- s
s at outb eaks South"-is it not ,i
ecough to make one laugh at the sim- nI
plicity displayed by our National C
Dead Head. "These autumnal out- B
breaks." What an expreuhdn for a
President, and what a commentary i
ape bhis government with their re- I
construction acts South. And then Ii
he intend to have no "chiid's' play. ~
If we mistake not, this worthy mag
nate'mkvde use of the same expression r
in relation toLouisdana, and the loss f
of his noble (t) party of bummers of '
twenty-six states, has convinced him,
or should at least, that it was no a
"child's play."
There were no riots in Mississippi
last year. Why ! Simply because a
there was no election. The whites
of that State are struggling for
life itselfagainst ignorance and cor
ruprion, and the beastial majority,
headed by Amen, yells for troops. 1
Let Grant furnish them if he dare. I
The majorities in Ohio, Pennsylva-i
nia and New York. will teach him a
lesson if he does, that will not soon
be forgotten.
Pierrepont's views of the murder of
innocent freedmen is rather strange
in the face of the Georgia plot. We
suppose, according to Pierrepont, that
killing white men and ugly white wo
men ; ravishing the young and beaut
B iful, is innocence. This is attrocious ;
criminal beyond expression. Barba
rians would have more manhood ; and 1
Grant as well as Pierrepout are well
worthy to be classed with the vilest
of demons. What is this government
coming tot Beacher virtuous ; free
loveism christianity; thieving and
murder applauded , and negro ravish
ers of Southern maidens innocent
angels. Ye Gods ! "'Time is out of

TILE EQt'IXOCTIAL STORM. - We
harve been enable to learn something
of the damage done the crops by the h
storm which visited our vicinity last F
week. Nearly all the hill farmers 24
suffered greatly as rell as the river
planters, though the latter not so
much. Creeks, bayous, and even u
Spanish Lake, were overflowed to a
great extent ; and the damage to cot
ton alone is estimated at 500 to 1000 ai
bales, which is serious indeed to our m
people. Corn suffered in proportion tI
having been prostrated by the wind, t]
sId iblow inithe maud, froaihichlit f
must be at once gathered or it will be w
ruined. Fm touiately no lives were lost, to
for which we must be thankful, as our o0
sister parish, Rapides, suffered in that b
extent. Trees in town were prostrated a
and for a time the gale was fearful. cl
The atmosphere was warm the eve- a
ning before ; but during the storm it ti
stood 
75 Mininam. 14
80 Maximum. It
77; Mean..
Thursday, previous to the storm, the V
Barometer indicated 20.19, on Friday
during the storm, 29-10 and Saturday
after 29-39. The total fall of rain was
7.101100 inches, which is a fearful t
amount of water for one rainfall in I
this country. Taking it all in all, it
was one of the heaviest storms that a
has ever visited our section. c

t Theives are numerous all over
the parish. Chicken roost's, Hog

Sgreatly. Cannot something be done
to put a stop to it.
It may not be amiss to informoar

g ceptions, the Badical wanderers

Our hearts a few days ago thought
life doubly blessed for having known
and loved the fair being whosle sonny
smiles will no longer greet us. But
to.day how changed our musings !
"D)aisy. is no more" re the sad, sad
wotds which haount our meditations,
they seem whispered by every sighing
zephyr; yea, all reminds as of our
lost treasure, but still we -can scarce
ly realize, that oar "Daisy," like
mother-earth's lovely dower, bloomed
to die away so soon..
It is indeed hard for devoted par.
ents to see their joy anti pride, their'
priceless jewel taken from tljwl. A.h !
it sems as tiIf etbeir wosii1fA learts

Then, friends of my noble, gentle,
Daisy, cease your weeping, tifr she
left us when Ieae lven loved her beat,
and claimed her bright :beautiful
soul as another gem of daulilng
splendor to deck the eternal throne.
Now sorrowing friends, forgive me
when I say, this thought should chase
every shadow from our brows, and
aid-us to embrace our cross with for
titude.
0! Daisy all that was kind, lovely
and true, language has no power to
express the pain thy unexpected death
caused thy many friends. Yes, sweet
maiden, we all shall miss thee, for
thy mild disposition had endeared
thee to one and all. Alas !it is mourn
fully sad to learn, that thou art ours
no more, but how consoling to kpgw
thy memory shrall always renu:ia to
be cherished. My dead, loving
friend, now farewell. Our tears still
flow while we bid our noble Daisy,
a long, sad last farewell.
