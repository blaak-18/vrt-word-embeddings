bhreveport's Progress Versus
:breveport's Shabbiness.
NOTES AND HtAI'PEN N',U
a
With due cretit to 3b'evepeir'' not btle
Dr 'great along tany lines. there is a no
ticeable and disheartening lack of int"re-t
Wit some matter4 by no means unimportant.
We have paved streets and beautiful 'on
Crete barquette.. I ut they are not lkept
Clean-au Contritre, debris of li'b1ken
SCoops, piles of beer kegs and other rub ileh
umber the aidewalks in iianv plac e,
while fruit pealings are everywhere e
menace to the unthinking pedestrian.
And our public square-the only one in
the city-is a resort for the young van ale
of the town. U41i marks of ravages are
seen in the scarred trees and grass be.
strewn With littler of all kinds. Evi
dences of shabbiness exist all over the
city, andoor excellent mayor couid nota
bly signalize his administration by put
ting a *'broom brigade" to work, sil
require every shop keeper and householder
to 'sweep be'ore his own door."
Sharp, vigorous and persastent me -ul es
are necessary to bring about reforms, and
' b Delieve that our mayor is equal to the
er.ency. We assure hire, on our faith,
that it he will put %be broom brigade to
work, and be a terror to the desuol ers of
property, the ladies of Shreveport will
come to his ald and oa aniz3 a street im
provement socity, euch as Memphis and
many other southern cities can boast of.
These stteet improvement societies are
composed of the intfuential .n1 tubilc
sofrited wowmn of the town, and their
special wor is tree planting ani the ot na
mentatlon of pubic sequ res. '* * *
&nother Matter that should engage the
attention of the city, as the care of the rid
city cemetery. Here in Goo's acre repose
the sterdy pioneers of this secion, men of
brain and bras r, whose perseverance,
courage and energy laid the toundations of
a city in the wilderness. Their grave
stones are mouldertrg -their names are
forgotten, saved by a few. In amany in
stances there is not a surviving member o
these old farilies to preserve the gravel
from the ravages of time.
itil a sad commentary on life, that right
ia the heart of our growing, busy city,
ted city of toe Dead. it
refroach to our people. It
ir pride to care for and make
resting place 01 tie founders
f Shreveport.
some years theie was an active
emetary Associatien, wnoe membership
paid monthly dues, and m ich was done tc
improve the streets an I ný.meotes spots In
the cemetery. But atter awoile the meet
ings were called irre.til nly, and after
awhile there were no meutings called. The
member' grew disheartenel and stopped
paying their monthly ;nitallments because
nothing was d.ne
But there are many true and devoted
members of the old C metery assoctatina,
who still hod themselves ready to rnor
ganiza and go to work again for the Im
provement of this sacred ground.
Neglected oemeteries are evidences of
* beitt defection in a community, and no
matter what signs of progress and pros
poriy a city may hive disregard and neg.
lect of the deal is a infaillble indication
of a step backward.
