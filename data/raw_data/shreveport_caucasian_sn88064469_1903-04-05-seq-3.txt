NOTICE.
My friend, Mr. Dan E. Nicholson, the
present assessor, has informed me that
he will not be a candidate for re-election
to that office. I hereby take this method
of notifying the voters of Caddo parish
that I will be a candidate and will see
each individual at the proper time. I
deem an active canvass now for an elec
tion over a year oif premature and un
wise.
C. E. PEPRONCEL.
