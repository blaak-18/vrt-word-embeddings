King Attakapas, the first mon- 4
arch before whom the headstrong
people of Lafayette have bowed in
humble submission and cheerfully 4
obeyed, atrived with his beautiful I
queen at the gates of the city Tues- 1
day morning and knocked for ad
mission. He arrived from the
west on one of Col. Huntington's
magnificiently equiped cars and was
welcomed at the Southern Pacific 1
depoe, by a crowd of as loyal sub- I
jects as ever owed allegiance to a
ruler. The dazzling pomp and
oriental splendor displayed in I
honor of the august personages
somewhat bewildered our people
who knew but little about kings and
thrones.
When the train stopped the king
and queen appeared on the platform.
of the car. They were immediately
escorted to the regal equipage
where they took seats beneath the
splendid canopy which covered the
royal float. The attendants who
were attired in gorgeous suits, oc
cupied their accustomed places.
Hun. Chas. D. Caffery, mayor of
Lafayette, stepped in front of the
chariot and delivered the following
appropriate address. He spoke in
a loud and district voice and was
heard by every one in the immense
throng. Mayor Caffery said:
ollst August and fost G'rac-ious
XKiha and Queen:
"The very great pleasure and the
exalted privilege of greeting your
majesties, falls to me, and such is
your magniticent fame, throughout
the land, that at the outset I am
driven to exclaim, Oh, King and
Queen ! live forever.
_ "Happy indeed are we, to be
thus favored, and for these, your
loyal subjects, I give you cordiali
welcome. With unfeigned joy and
tinbounded gratitude, they behold
your majesties in person, and di
tect me to avow their unswerving
loyalty and devotion. "But, Oh
King! I tender you more than wel
come. I congratulate you more es
pecially upon the true patriotism of
your subjects in this department of
your Kingdom. I congratulate you
and them upon this unmistakable
manifestation of entesprise, energy
and public spirit which we have
here to-day. By this demonstration
they proclaim their determination
that neither the subjects of the Roi
de Cypre, nor those of any other
potentate, shall surpass them in
those attributes which characterize
a great and glorious nation.
"It is my province, moreover,
to acknowleage, on behalf of these,
your subjects, your most benign
and excellent rule over them. In
deed, there runs a saying through
out the land, that, "uneasy lies the
head that wears a crown", but, that
saying, applicable no doubt to the
ruler of the Turkish empire or the
Czar of all the Russias, has not and
haever will have any application to
your majesty's great and glorious
reign.
,"For this I welcome you again in
the name of all your subjects; of
those of Carencro, Royville, Brous=
sard, Scott, Duson, all! And in
coficlusion I tender to you the keys
of Lafayette. Take them, your
majesty; ay, take not only the keys,
but take the town. Do as you
thoose with it; paitat it, paint " any
color you please, and we wilt' still
cry, lotg live the King, the great
ialdd only King of the Attakapas."'
Befe. e concluding his address
. .-iny<: ,:aifeiy tendered the King
tht' key' of the city of Lafayette.
At, the c,:clusion of this ceremony
.i 'j Wx.W er Mouton's far-famed

bII;' iaagnmficent pageant pro
cecded through the streets of the loc
city which were literally packed at
with people who had come from
this and adjoining parishes to parti- re!
cipate in the festivities. Never on
were the avenues, streets and alleys co
of the city so crowded with visitors.
Throngs of men, women and chil- tai
dren blockaded the passage and it lac
c( r.quired the hardest kind of work cr4
by Marshals McFaddin and Himel M4
to clear the streets to enable the Mý
r- royal pageant to proceed on its ge
journey of mirth and pleasure. The Di
parade was through the principal H,

in The royal chariot, generally con- les
ly ceeded to the finest float in the co
ul parade, was about twenty five feet of
s- hight. It was beautifully mounted

Diamond Pin Recovered. A
Times-I)emocrat.
Sheriff Isaac Broussard, the pop
ular sheriff of Lafayette, while en
route to see the Mardi Gras festiv
ities, had the good luck to. recover
a $6oo diamond pitn and returning
it to a lady, Mrs. Cora Wilson, who
was so unfortunate as to lose it
while coming to New Orleans on a
Southern Pacific train. The lady
thought she had been robbed of the
pin, and when she found it was gone
she was sorely distressed. Some
r
one on the train suggested that
Sheriff Isaac Broussard was on
board and he might .be able to sug
gest some way to recover the stolen
bauble.
Sheriff Broussard was introduced
to the lady and after questioning
the lady he was convinced of the
fact that the pin had been lost and
not stolen. He ordered a thorough
search of the train, and by his di
1 rection, Mr. Boyd, an official of
5 the train, succeeded in recovering
I the much valued pin. The pin was
set with many valuable jewels, dia
e monds, etc., and was valued at
a $6oo.

The Youthful Murderers WVere no
Sentenced Thursday Evening.
They Had Nothing to Say.
i ye
s The Gazette reporter visited the ad
- Blanc brothers in their cell at the to
e parish jail Saturday afternoon.
a The youthful murderers seemed ye
pleased to see some one and con
versed freely. They had received tw
a call from Col. G. A. Breaux and F!
Judge C. H. Mouton in the morn
ing and appeared to appreciate the ye
attention paid them by their attor- kr
neys. They said that they knew ro
they had been ably and earnestly
s defended and expressed their appre- to
ciation of the fact that their defense
had been placed into the hands of
g of some of the best-known lawyers i
of this section. Though the verdict P`
e which sends them to the scaffold
was a terrible one, yet, they felt cc
d that it was the inevitable result of
their confession. The younger, a¬
Alexis, said in answer to an inquiry, v
"We have talked too much. That
is all. Had we kept the secret and n'
n not confessed, we would not be t1
T- P
here."
In the cell is a religious book. 1
g "'It was given us by a kind woman ic
during our stay in the New Orleans
prison," said Ernest. W\Ve are
a Catholics and we find some conso- '
lation by perusing its pages. Our
mother was a Catholic and of ri
course we made our first com
emunion, but, like most young men
in Paris, we dri:ted away from the d
n church." tl
The prisoners spoke in compli- tl
mentary terms of the officers of the s'
court, particularly of Sheriff Brous- n
sard, whom they declared to be a
brave and good man. To their
d keeper, Deputy Mouton, they felt.
,h very grateful for kind treatment.
- They said they did not desire
f that their case be taken to the }
SSupreme Court on appeal. "WVhyI
as should we?" spoke Ernest. "Itt
a- will only prolong our troubles." ti
at TIHE SINT1ENCIE.
Ernest and Alexis Blanc were
sentenced by Judge J)ebaillon
as Thursday afternoon. They were
,n conducted into court by Sheriff
rd Broussard at half past three o'clock.
:rt Both looked steadfastly at the judge I
il- while he pronounced the sentence.
to To the question if he had anything
he to say why the sentence should not
Id be passed upon him, Ernest re
h- plied in an audible tone of voice,
he "No sir." He maintained a
look of determination, and at no
to time did his facial expression betray
li- any symptons of fear. He ap
peared as a man who had made up
n. his mind to die and wished to go
through the ordeal as speedily as
a possible. Not so with the younger
Is. brother, Alexis. He stood with
trembling body and flushed cheeks.
d. The studied indifference noticeable
si- during the trial had given place to
as an expression of horror. The
)le judge told them that he d;d not I
ed wish to go over the facts as they
ri- were too well-known. lie stated
As that they had been defended by
'P- able counsel, who would have se- t
le. cured a lighter verdict had such a
thing been possible.
After the sentences had been
passed on both prisoners the sheriff
tie manacled the youthful murderers to
of gether and took them away to their
lic dreary apartment in the parish jail.
re It now remains for the governor
ud to sign the death warrant and fix
)ut the day of execution. The time al
n lotted for this formality is generally
le sixty days.

DEIATH OF 1MRS. ALEXANDEII
u- MOUTON.
Ou Mrs. Alexander Mouton died at
e, her residence near this town last
at Monday morning at half past six
o'clock.
n- Mrs. Mouton's maiden name was
p- Emma K. Gardner. She was of
distinguished stock, being a daughtet
of Col. Charles K. Gardner, a
in member of President Jackson's
or cabinet, and a sister of the lamehted
's, General Frank Gardner. She was
ly born in the year 182o in New York
re City, and was married to the late
sh (;overnor Mouton more than half a.
century ago in Washington, D. C.
At the time Gov. Mouton was a
vn member of the upper house of Con
tic gress, being a senator from Louis
iana.
he Mrs. Mouton was a lady of cx
he tensive enformation and was gifted
or with a bright mind. She enjoyed all
her faculties to the time of her death
and her health was unusually gooti
for one of so advanced an age. Only
a few days before her death she
found much pleasure in reading.
She was able to read without the
use of glasses, and no one was
more familiar with the current
events of the day. During her last
iss days on earth she was free from the
infirmities of old age, and the end
is- came peacefully and without pain.
SA short time ago she had
la- an attack of la grippe which
of so weakened her system that
Monday morning she breathed
me her last, surrounded by her
so- children. She was a devout Cath
olic and before dying received all
the tie religious comfort which that
Schurch extends.
Mt rs. Mouton was kind and charl
table, and loved to help the ncedy
a and succor the afihicted. She was
a devoted mother, a dutiful wife
andl a good friend. Of her it is no
d fulsomne eulogy to say that she was
ug a Christian woman.
