The Little Heart that Waits+
The evening breeze is singing low
A lullaby to-day;
I have a question I would ask,
Before it dies away.
Thl, pebbles on the beanch are dry,
The tide has tunken low;
l A little form is staLding there,
Between the ebb and flow.
A t.tngleil mass of soft brown hair,
Two eyes ca(st meekly down,
A little thece the sun has kissed,
Two chleeks a little brown;
Two little lips thau pout and say,
S"I do ot think 1 know ;"
iwo l itl e lin t il :ad .,, . . t.
A little heart that lon;ing waits
To know what next 'twill hear;
A little face that shyly looks
To see if still I'Im ter.
Ah! little heart that whispered "Yes,"
Though pouting lips said "No,"
You thought that you'd be asked agaiit
Between the ebb and flow.
A little face half frightened when
I turned to go away;
Two little hands that shyly reach
As if to bid nme stay;
', A little voice that softly says, .
"1 did not mean that 'No;'"
A little pride that well was lost
Beneath the ebb and tlow.
Professional Morals. le;
wl
No man has a right to practice his co
profession in such a way as to en let
courage personal vice in those whom wt
he serves, or wrong-doing towards pc
individuals and the coimunity. This of
is a very simple proposion,-to which te
no respectable man in any profession qii
will presumet to make objection. If pr
there ever lived a professional vil- ti
lain of whom a professional vilifier wn
could say : "This is he who made it co
safe to murder, and of whose health qr
thieves asked before they began to to
3; steal," he could only be saved from to
universal execration by -a natural is
. doubt of the justice of the sarcasm )3
and the candor of its author. The- wi
- oretically, there are no differences Sc
l, among decent men on this subject,
when it is placed before the mind in
this way. It is one of those simple,
self-evident propositions,. about which
no man would think of arguing for re
an instant. Up to the bar of this in
proposition one can bring every act nii
a, of his professional life, and decide so
for himself whether it be legitimate tit
and morally good. We repeat it,- se
- NA stan 1has a right to practice his bS
profession in such a way as to encoie)- b.
ige perso-nal eke in tgose whome he eij
serves, or wrong-doing towards indi
vidual. and the cnnmunity. th
The great cities are .full of men ea
who lhke achieved remarkable skill se
bi the treatment of'a certain tldes of at
diseases, and other dangerous or in- ed
convenient consequences of a bestial ti
social vice. No matter how often flt
their patients may approach them, w
or how vile they may be, or how suc- it
cessfully they may scheme against Si
the peace and purity of society, or
what form tile consequiences of their st
sin mity assume, these professional ht
men take their fee, and do what they de
can to shield the sinners from th6 ef- yi
fect of their crimes. Whatever they a
may be able to do ptofessionally to w
make it safe for men and women to ti
trample upon the laws of social pu- n
rity, they do and constantly stand sl
) ready to do. Yet these men have a ti
defense of themselveb which edables .
them to hold their heads 'up. They o
are physicians. It i3 their buisiness I
to treat disease in whatever form it, g
Many prbsent itself. It would be im- a
er. pertinent in them-to inquire into the t!
ter life of those who come to themfor v
advice, They are not:the keepers of a
- btier men's Ctonsciedes, They are t
men of science and not of morals; It i
is their business to cure diseasb by
the speediest and best methods they a
know, and not to inqunire.into char- a
e acter, or be curious about the indi- t
On rect results of theit skill.. BSuch
would be their dtenusea or the line of I
their defense yet, if it can be seen
ofr shown that their professional life I
encourages vice in the community,; by
the. constant shield which it offers
against the Consequences of vice, the
defence amounts to nothing. If a 1
debauchee or a sensualist of any sort
finds impunity for his excesses in the
professional skill of his lhysieian,
and relies upon thit skill to shield t
htm from the consequences of Ils siii I
be they what they may, his physi
cian becomes the partner of his guilt
for-gold, and di profeisional pander to
his appetites: He may find profes
sional brethren to defend him, but
before the unsophisticated moral sense
of the ,World he will be a degraded
man, iihtm stand condemned.
There are uch mnen in the world as
profes;!sonal pairdoners of- sin. 'here
are nmen in priestly robes who, on
the confession of a penitent; or one
who assumes the pOsitiou of ra peni
Stent, release him lirofessionally from
tile eomsequenees of hisa misdeeds.
Unless lisltory hias lied, there have
been  inen among these to whom the
vieidus have gine for thrift and par.
* ion for a cobbideration, and rbceived
I all what they tweit 'for, on every occasion
ii. of overt fitime hen thae voiCe of
* eonscieone in-their superstitious souls
would not be still, anid who have re
tired from the cotfessional i'eady for I
more crimes, from whoso spiritual S
consequences they have intended and n
expected to find relief in the same i
way. It is not necessary to charge p
such desecration of the priestly oilice i
upon anty one. We have no reason to
believe that in this country such 8i
thiigs are conumonu; but. We know
that priests are human,p nd that there a
hlave heen btad and m,.rcenary men I
amiong them. It is orely necessary tt
suppose cases like this, to see that a a
priest may, in the exercise of his pro- n
fcssional functions, become the part- b
ner of the criminal in his crimes, a e
fliend and protector of vice, and p
foe to the purity and good order of
society. Hi can set up his profes. f!
.i l tlefoise, atnd find professional a
detmefcte:d 1 t ,perhaps; but any child, t
capable of comprehending the ques
tion, will decide that lihe is degraded tl
and disgraced. '
\Vhat is true, or may be true, of
these professions, is true of airy pro- u
fession. Nothing is more notorious c
than that there are lawyers who are Ia
public nuisances-who encourage liti- h
gation, who are universally relied h
upon by criminals for the defense of
crime, and whose ieputatioti and v
money have indeed been won by their I
ability to 'lear the guilty from the
consequences of their wrong-doing. s
Between these low extremes of pro- p
fessional prostitution .and the nigh u
a ground occuietd by the great mass of
legal men, there are .many points c
where self-interest, united with in- s
9 complete khiwledge, .s powerful to
lead the best minds into doubtful t
I ways, and 'engage them in the sup- i
s port of doubtful causes or the defense
9 of doubtful mlen. It is freely admit

Scared Out of a Wife;
Ii The narrative which I am about to
r relate was told me one bleak, cold night, I
s in a country parlor. It was one of those
t nights in maid-winter, when the wind
e swept over the land, making everything
e tingle with its frosty beesth, that I was
- seated before a blazing fire, surrounded l
s bya jolly half-dozen boys and an old
bachelor-Peter Green-about forty and
e eight years old.
- It was just the night without to make
those within enjoy a good story, so that
n each of us had to tell his favorite story,
II save- Mr. Green, and as he was a jolly
ºf story-teller, we were somewhat surpsri
t" ed to hear him say: "I have no story
d that would interest you," so we had to
n find.other entertainments for a while,
t, when one of the boys told me to ask how
it happened that he never got married.
it So he did.
Wr Well, gentlemen, (he began) it don't
ir seem right for me to tell yoe how that
ii happeded, but as !it is about myself I
y don't care much, You see when I was
f- young we had to walk as high as fite
y miles to ehurch and singing-school,
to which was our chief enjoyment. But
to this don't have anything to do with my
1- not getting a wife, but I just wanted to
d show you that we had omei trouble in
a them days in getting dur splort.
s . Joh Smith mnd I wre like brothers,
S or like "Mary Add her little lamb."
as Where one went the other was sure to
it go. We went to see two sisters, and
aii- s we were not the best boys imaginable,
he the old gentleman took umbrage and
or wouldn't let us come near the house;
of so we would take the girls to the end of
re the lane, and there we would have to
It take the final kiss.
b' We soon got tired of that sort of fuii,
ey and I told John, on our way to siedging
ir- school one nIight, that I was going into
li- the house, too.
ch He said the old man would ruin me if
of I did.
en I told him I was going to risk it any
ife how, let come what would.
by He said "'he would risk it if I would."
8rs So liome we went with the girls.
he When wte got to the end of the lane I
Sa told the girls we proposed going all the
nit way.
Ie They looked at eadc other i, a way I
n; didn't like too well, but said. they (the
old old folks) woultd be in bed, so they didn't
ii care if we did.:

ee and we had four miles to walk, I told
en Jobb wh had to be going. So we step
ne pod out 6n ihe ofrch, but just as we did
mi- so, the slay was lit up by lightning, and
om one toemendoid tbhunder peal rolled alorg

the old man flourishing his cane above lin
