Are You
Sick?
Much sickness is due fei
a weak nervous system.
Yours may be. If it is,
you cannot get well until
you restore nerve strength
Your nervous system is
nature’s power house; the
organs of your body get
their power from it. If
the power is not there, the
action of the' 6 ’ organs is
weak, and disease (sick
ness) follows. Dr. Miles*
Nervine cures the sick
because it soothes the
irritated and tired nerves
and gives the system a
chance to recuperate.
Try it, and see if you do
not quickly feel its bene
ficial effect.

the South were utilized to their best
advantage.
The South needs to be taught some
thing about cotton. The planting and
cultural methods are still crude. The
handling and marketing of the cotton
are atrocious. The splendid fleecy
supply is carelessly picked. When it
comes from the gins it is even badly
cut by the saws, and the fiber is
mixed with leaves and trash. The
bales are imperfectly covered, and
when traveling a long distance, as
when sent to Europe, they are bat
tered beyond description. The waste
in planting, cultivating, ginning,
handling and marketing costs the
South one hundred million dollars an
nually. This hundred million dollars
cent, of all the commercial fertilizers
sold in America.
During the Civil War, when the port
of New Orleans was blockaded, the
export of cotton seed cake was pre
vented, and it was used for fuel in
the Southern town. The hulls, at con
siderable effort and expense, were
dumped on vacant areas in the sub
urbs. There were herds of cattle graz
ing in the neighborhood, and the
owners, sharing an old prejudice that
cotton hulls were poisonous to cattle,
employed a line of men to keep the
herds away from the dangerous ban
quet. But the continued blockade
made foodstuff scarce, and as a last
resort the lean and hungry cattle
were permitted to browse on the for
bidden hulls. The herds got fat!
Today, when the oil mills of the
South began to disgorge hulls, stock
men buy cattle and send them to lo
calities in the mill neighborhood.
Instead now of watching these cattle
to prevent them from eating hulls,
they are fenced in and given nothing
else to eat. As many as five thou
sand cattle in one enclosure will be
found eagerly eating out of troughs
filled with cotton hulls. Barrels of
salt are left open, plenty of water is
supplied, and everything done to ena
ble the cattle to eat all they can of a
product from which a few 7 years ago
men were employed to keep them
away.
The conservatism that has retarded
the development of cotton itself has
had a conspicuous effect in preventing
America from keeping pace with the
rest of the world in the manufacture
of cotton goods. I refer to the quan
tity of goods purchased. There was a
time when it was not believed possible
that manufactured goods could come
from the American colonies, and Eng
land sought to confirm that belief by
political and commercial laws. It was
a repetition of history.
For ages England was under the
yoke of dependence upon the manufac
tories of Flanders. It was a saying
for centuries in Europe that one
could buy a fox from England for a
groat and sell back the finished tail for
a guilder! It seemed that the Eng
lishman was doomed to go on for
ever in his fogs gathering wool, and
after selling the raw material buy it
back at a high price from the Flemish
weavers.
When England in its turn awoke to
its opportunities it attempted to as
sure its market in America, by keep
ing the colonies in a purely
Zst)e Jeffersonian
tural and pastoral state. And while
we have, through protection and other
causes, succeeded in becoming a great
industrial empire, we have never fully
thrown off the yoke of the thought
that all England and Europe holds
over us; viz., that we are incapable
of manufacturing cotton goods for the
world. As an allegory, the story of
the fox and the tail now applies to
America’s South in its relation with
the cotton-buying nations. The South
ern planter today, with few excep
tions, is an abject slave of the Old
World. The only difference between
the ryot of India and the Southern
farmer in the furrow behind his mule
is that one breathes the air of liberty.
The Southern planter who has it in
his power to combine with his neigh
bor' and become one of the industrial
masters of the world is now so piti
fully poor that he could make more
money by going as an operative and
humbly working in the mills —mills
that could not exist without the cot
ton which the struggling planters
grow. It is a pathetic and ironical
fact that there is more money behind
the spinning-jenny than behind the
Southern mule!
When the last great industrial revo
lution came, it was not due to one but
to many miirds. Hargreaves and Ark
wright, Jacquard and Whitney were
practically contemporaries, giving to
cotton its great opportunity at the mo
ment when the world was most in
need of it. The utilization of coal had
transferred industry from the warm
regions of the Mediterranean, where
men could work in scant attire, to the
colder latitude of England and Ger
many. And America had come into
its own. All the civilizations of an
cient times had been compelled to shun
the zone where ice formed and snow
fell. The Use of cotton for garmnets
extended clothing to the masses and
made it possible for them to center
their civilization on far to the north,
regardless of climate. Therefore only
the few and the most venturesome
had moved permanently into latitudes
where millions of human beings are
now prosperous.
When the world was ready with the
new civilization, at the beginning of
the nineteenth century, we had a new
fabric within the reach of the multi
tude. We cannot civilize a race with
out clothing it.
Today the thirteen million bales of
cotton converted into cloth turn out on
a yards basis more than seventy-one
billion yards, valued at nearly six bil
lion dollars. Edward Atkinson has es
timated that if all of the world’s in
habitants were civilized, and as a re
sult were consumers of cotton, it
would call for an annual crop of
forty-two million bales of five hundred
pounds each.
