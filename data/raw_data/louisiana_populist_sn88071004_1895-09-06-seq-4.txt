A Mrs. Taylor, of Florida, recently
had a disagreement with a bear which
weighed 250 pounds. She took aclub
and went for the beast, and soon
clubbed him to death. Her skill in
the use of the weapon argues long
and constant practice, and it Is safe
to presume that when she advises Mr.
Taylor to be home before 10 o'clock
nothing but a most serious emergency
prevents his following the advice.

' METER CANNOT LIE.
A IMCKEL-IN-THE SLOT AFFAIR
NOW IN USE.
4 ('in Turns on Your Ca, ind the
Vial Tells You When Your Money's
Worth llas All Been Consumed-GiEves
Satisfaction Wherever t'sed.
AS turned on by
L the nickel - in - the
slot system is an
S)) innovation fr o
England that has
been adopted by
the Consolidated
Gas Company, of
New York City,
and the "prepay
ment meter," so
called, may in time
succeed the present method of meas
uring gas as consumed in small house
holds. In London a dozen rival ma
chines are in vogue. The most popular
s ones are the "penny slots." A coin of
this value is dropped into a small open
ing and gaslight is furnished for an
hour or so. This class of meter is very
a popular among the poorer people.
many of whom use gas only on state
occasions. The penny gas machines
are also very popular with single gen
tlemen of limited means, who live in
lodgings, says New York World. The
a prepayment meters introduced in New
York are not of the penny pattern. A
silver quarter is the coin required to
release the illuminating fluid. The
t mechanism is simple, yet delicate. The
size of the coin, not its weight, is what
releases the machinery. For twenty
a five cents 200 feet of gas is secured.
which is at the regular rate of $1.25 per
t 1.000. The gas need not be used con
c tinuously. A special indicator on the
face of the dial, which is supposed to
show how much gas goes through the
meter, moves out to the 200-foot mark
as soon as the coin is deposited. As the
I gas is used, this indicator returns to
the zero point. Meters of this class are
placed in the consumer's room or fiat,
so that the number of feet still to
be burned may be seen at a glance at
the dial. The machine is so arranged
a that two, three or four quarters may be
placed in the slot, and thus 400, 600 or
1 1,000 feet of gas purchased. The meter
will register and give credit for 200
feet of gas every time a coin of the
proper dimension is placed in the re
ceiver.
Treasurer Doane, of the gas company,
believes that the prepayment meter
will become as popular in the large
cities of America as it is London, es
pecially among the people with whom
gaslight Is a luxury. Take a family
of hard working people in which there
are young ladies who have company on
Sunday. Candles or kerosene are all
right during the week days, but gas
light on such an occasion is necessary
to "give the house a tone." As 25 cents
will light the parlor for several even
ings it will readily be seen that meters
will find their way into thousands of
households which, under the prevail
ing system of making a deposit, and
meeting a monthly bill, would never
have use for them.
Many people believe that the every
day gas meter continues to register
right along whether gas is being burned
or not. This could not. happen with
the new quarter-in-the-slot meter, as
the consumption is hourly under the
consumer's eye.
Mr. Doane said to a World reporter
that the matter of the value of the
coin to be used in New York was
seriously considered for several months
before the quarter was adopted. The
cost of collection, as the meters must
be visited at stated intervals by em
ployes of the company, is as great for
alckels or dimes as for quarters, and
this one fact determined the question.
Should there appear in the future a de
mand for a smaller system of payment,
there are a number of meters in the
market to chose from.
dLa than 300 of the slot meters are
la use in the city at present, owing to
the fact that no special effort has been
made to push them. They have proved
so satisfactory, however, both to con
sumer and producer that their general
use by all small concerns, will be urged
in the future, but not insisted upon. A
quarter will illaminate an ordinary
four-room and kitchen fiat for one
week.

HE SAW SNAKES.
They Were Real Ones, but He NMgn
the Pledge.
A good story is told about Major Bar
tow of Georgia. This gentleman's ex
citing war reminiscences, together with
his ability to absorb the product of the
"still' without apparent injury to his
constitution or impediment to his loco
motion, earned him fame and great
prestige among the convivial spirits in
his native town. The major, while sup
erintending the cultivation of his to
bacco crop, one day found six pretty
round eggs, and so greatly pleased was
he at their beautiful appearance that
he picked them up, and carefully wrap
ping them in his handkerchief stowed
them away in his pocket, intending to
take them home as playthings for his
grandchildren.
He forgot all about them, however,
and indeed for several days thereafter
the eggs remained undisturbed. In the
meanwhile, assisted by the warmth of
the surroundings, nature had wrought
a change-the eggs were no longer
eggs. but so many animate creatures
destined to give the unconscious owner
of their birthplace such a shock as he
had never experienced since the hour of
his first battle. It happened thus: One
evening the major was entertaining a
group of his admiring friends with a
most exciting chapter from his experi
ence on the tented field, when in the
course of his narative he paused, drew
out his 'kerchief to wipe his face, and
lo! six very lively little snakes wiggled
down the front of his waistcoat and
onto the table at which he sat. The
major's face was a study for the cam
era; his eyes bulged out till they ap
peared twice their natural size, his
mouth became a cavern, and his com
plexion changed from a brick red to a
leaden hue. He remained tranfixed for
the space of twenty seconds, then with
a yell that could be heard half over the
village he fled out into the night.
Rumor has it that he signed the
pledge before morning, but the rumor
has no foundation in fact.
A COLORED ARISTOCRACY.
Negroes Preprring to Establish a Caste
Line In Alabama.
The ex-slaves of Alabama are prepar
ing to organize an association to which
none of the late-day negroes will be ad
mitted. After the association has been
organized it is intended to have state
associations, and then take in all the
old-time negroes of the slave-holding
states.
And why not, pray? These ex-slaves
"belonged" to the best families of the
south, and they base their claims to
social supe tority upon their aristo
cratic connections before the war. In
good breeding and imposing bearing
it would be hard to find their equals
among the best educated of what they
sometimes condescendingly call "the
late-day negroes." Many of them en
joyed social advantages of the highest
order. The old house servants had con
stantly before their eyes some of the
best types of ladies and gentlemen to
be found in the world. They studied the
manners of their masters and mis
tresses, imitated their style of conversa
tion, and insensibly modeled them
selves in all particulars after the fine
examples before them. Many years of
freedom have not impaired their good
breeding nor their pride in the social
school in which they were brought up.
They feel that they belong to a socially
distinguished class, that they have a
past worth cherishing and preserving,
and that they have a right to be ex
clusive. Why should they not found a
society of their own, based on their
social traditions? Possibly, if they
were to investigate the subject closely
they would be able to discover many
deeds of merit and courage performed
by their ancestors in colonial and revo
lutionary times which would entitle
them to form revolutionary and colon
ial societies. At present they only pro
pose to go back to the general period in
time designated by the phrase "before
the war." The colonial and revolution
ary pedigree may and probably will
come later.

I t.E WINNING OF FAME.
I One of the Ways In Which a Man May
p'erpetuate His Memory.
A man may win widespread and
long-enduring fame by founding an in
stitution of learning which shall bear
his name. says New York Sun. The
cry "Cornell" was heard over England
last week-it had long been familiar in
the United States; and the years have
added lustre to the memory of Ezra
Cornell, who founded the university at
Ithaca, N. Y., which was chartered
thirty years ago, and opened for stu
dents in 1868, during the Presidency of
t Andrew Johnson. The name of the
Rev. John Harvard of England and
I Massachusetts has been commemorated
for more than two centuries and a half
3 as the founder of Harvard college, now
known as Harvard university. The
name of Elihu Yale, born in New
lHaven, Conn., died in England, is em
3 balmed in Yale university, formerly
kI nown as Yale college, which enjoyed
t his benefactions in the first quarter of
r the eighteenth century. In California
3 there is Stanford university, named af
r ter a son of the late Leland Stanford;
there is the Johns Hopkins university
in Baltimore: there is Vanderbilt uni
versity in Tennessee; there is Vassar
college near Poughkeepsie called after
I Matthew \'assar, and there are many
other universities or colleges called af
ter their founders or benefactors. The
Rev Dr. Marcus Whitman, a pioneer in
1 the farthest west, is commemorated in
I Whitman college, soon to be university,
I in the state of Washington. If one can
not found a university or a college, a
seminary may serve to perpetuate his
name. At East Hampton, in Massa
I chusetts, there is Willliston seminary,
named after their founders. It may be
I ton: and there are in the country hun
dreds of other institutions of the kind
i named after their founders. It may be
inferred from the examples here that
the man who desires to perpetuate his
I memory would do well to establish a
university: college, seminary, or other
institution of learning, and give it his
name.
BEES AT ASCOT.
They Made Things Lively at the Race
Track for a While.
A curious incident occurred at Ascot.
While a large number of pleasant
luncheon parties were enjoying the de
lights of an open-air repast in the gar
dens behind the grand stand a great
swarm of bees settled down on the
guests around a table in a corner, says
London Telegraph. They buzzed and
buzzed everywhere. Ladies had bees in
their bonnets and gentlemen found
their hats turned into striking like
nesses of "Catch-'em-alive-oh's." Some
of the swarm settled on the cold sal
mon, and other members of it tumbled
into the champagne cup. In fact, the
bees created the greatest consternation
among the ladies and gentlemen in
that portion of the grounds. They were
gradually drawn off the luncheon party
by a gentleman, to whom occurred the
happy idea of treating them to a little
music on a metal tray under a tree.
After the tapping or tinkling on the
article had continued for two or three
moments the queen bee settled on the
branches above to listen to it, and was
at once followed by all the swarm. It
was an extraordinary sight to see hun
dreds of the insects hanging like great
black and gold clustors on the tree
while the tinklink continued. It ceased
with the luncheon, and the bees did no
more harm. In the earlier part of the
performance a lady was pretty severely
stung.
