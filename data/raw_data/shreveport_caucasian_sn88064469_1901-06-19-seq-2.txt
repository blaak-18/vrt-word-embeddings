OF THE

THE POLICE JU'KY
It is frequently asserted that tLe
City Council is composed of too
many members and that the preseut
membership, fifteen, if reduced to
eight would be more effective- Why i
The critics have not considered tb(
situation nor the condition. Ther,
is no reason why the council should
not be more elective and power u
for good with Afteen mdmbers that
with eight members. In a compars
tiye esose of effectivenes we mtJ&
ite the Police Jury of Caddo panish,
hlbch s constituted of fourteen mem
bers, being one leas than the Cit;
Cormeasl. Has any one ever suggested
a deeresee in the number of the
Plle. Jury ? The good work of the
Police Jury is of record and as s
body will compare favorably with tb,
best in the land. The Police Jury
attekd strictly to busines, when io
8essua fo' business, and generally
knew what they are about, what the
peeplq w.nat, and legislate for the
gaeral weltfare of the parish.

The battleship Illinois has made
nearly eighteen knots speed on ber

only sixteen knots, the department:
deeming that the best speed that
could be secured under the plans. It
it were not for our up-to date ship
builders our new navy would b,
rather a slow affair, says the Hon3

for less speed than eighteen knots for
