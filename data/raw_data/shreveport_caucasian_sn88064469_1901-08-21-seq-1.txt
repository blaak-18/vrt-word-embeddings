THE NEEDS OF CUBA.
It I. Not Annexratioun r Free Trade, but
Lower Duties.
New York, Aug. 21.- L. V. DeAbad,
ommnissioner for the Ec.no-nic Associa
tion of Cuba, who is at present in this
city, says he does not believe the com
mercial elements of Cuba are desirous
of establishing free trade tariff relations
with the United States. In the course
of an interview Mr. DeAbad said:
*The prospect of the annexation of
Cuba to the United States should make
every reflective business man consider
the question of what effect a political
annexation might have upon the econ
omic relationships of the island with
the United States.
"In the United States the removal of
duties on Cuban products would be a
deadly blow to the sugar, tobacco and
other agricultural industries.
"Those who states that Cuba wants
free trade with the United States have
either been deceived or are trying to
deceive the American people. What
Cuba really does want is to harmonize
her interests with those of the United
States. This could be done by remov
ing from 30 to 40 per cent of the import
duties upon certain productions.
"The present economio oonditions of
the island are very bad and there is no
hope for relief until the tariff is changed.
Many tobacco factories have reduced
their output and in many sugar mills
wages will have to be decreased to 30
or 40 oents a day in order that the crop
of 1902 may be placed upon the market.
"It is, of course, unfair to assume I
that revolution makers in all cases
would take advantage of a time of eoo
nomic distress to stir up trouble, yet a
state of brigandage might be induced by
a general poverty stricken condition of
the people which would be serious in its
oonsequenoes.
"The United States has done Cuba
lacalculable benefit by relieving her of
her great publio debt. This debt used
1o cost about $10,000,000 annually, and
was part of a budget of $24,000,000.
"Cuban prosperity demands a redno
lion of import duties in the United
states, but the proteotipniats here must
iot look a millionaire aud have much
it his money in trade with Ohina."
SEVEN MEN KILLED.
They Lose Their Lives righttag a Firs
Amoeg OU Tasks.
Philadelphia, Aug. SO.-Five firemen
and two other men were killed by the
explosion or a big beozine tank at the
Atlantic Refining oompany's Oil works
at Point Breese. When the explosion
oourred the firemen and employee of
the Atlantio Refnluing company, in all
about 50 men, wee as work in the
pamping house drawingla off the oil from
the burning tanks when the flames shot
high in the air and the pamping house
almost completely demolished. The Are.
men who had been pltying streams on
the other tanks then directed their at.
tention to the rescue of the men who
had beeu imprisoned in the pumping
house. It was nearly an hour before
she men could be reached.
Since early this morning the fames
have spread to five additional tanks,.
making 18 that have been destroyed At
10 o'clock a. m. the tire was still beyond
ooutrnl and although most of the tanks
not yet on fire stood apart from those
burning, there is constant fear of the
fames reaching them. A pale, hblask
smoke hangs over the city.

This much regarding an old poet.
Here is a new one with an apparently
promuising future. This is Herbert
T'rench,' whose "Deirdre Wed" and
other poems John Lane inhas just
pubilished. Perihips no collection of
verse written in thle last decade so
thoroughly represents the poetic con
dition of the English mind at the ma
ment as this little volume of Mr.
T'rencht . which will greatly delight
one class of readers and as greatly dis
please another, and both with1 reason,
it is so promnising andl so disappoint
in-. A critical analysis may show
erudtities and defects, but there is un
questioned merit in his work. whichi
lshows poetic tire and genius, strongly
ren!inding one of Keats in "Endy

ithe unceremonious expulsion of
George Kernan fronm Russia has dl
rected public attention to his book,
"Siberla antd the Exile Systemn." which
startled the world ten years ago by its
revelation of the way political offend
srs were treated by the czar. As a
erilt in The Century the same mate
lal had caused a veritable sensation.
"opies of the magazine circulated in
