which it raley

hestr I ieuid
bitch out on a
hot summer day
aad go down on the Creek a fahin and
swimmin and foolin around, and have
the tegulat fisherman's luck, and eat
dizi$tr enough for three different peo
ple, and fling in 21 apples and 87 peaches
and my hat full of plums for good
measure, and never miss a meal 'of
rictuals or lose a lick of sleep.
A Vlsbam And A eoollu.
But it is way yonder different with
your humble servant now. I still feel
as young and fresh and healthy and
and hongtry and happy as a yearlin
boy, you understand, but I can't go as
fast nor come as quick, nor travel as
many gaits, nor cover as much 'ground
in one day as I use to could.
May be you mought wonder how in
the thunderations I come to find it out
so suddent like, and in orderment to be
plum natural and honest I am bound to
own up and tell you that I have been
fool enough here lately to try it on.
Bright and early one mornin last
week Will Tom Pickens and little flunk
Weatherford come by my house in a
wagon-and give it out to me that they
was goin ofl down on Big Wolf Creek
on a fishin frolic, and nothin would do
but I must pack up and go with them.
1 was dead crazy to go from the jump,
you understand, but for the sake of
peace at home and general appearments
I pulled on the bit considerable and
finally at last told the boys bein as it
was them I reckon I would have to go.
So we lit out, we did, and on the way
down to the creek we made a run on
Deacon Joiner's orchard, and by this
time you understand, that one-horse
wagon was loaded to the guards with
fishin poles and kitchen physic, and
fruit and nicknacks and-other farm
producements.
The weather it was particlar hot, but
we made the trip in the cool of the
mornin, and durin the day down there
on the creek we had more fun-of one
sort and another-than you could shake
a stick at. We didn't do any fishin to
hurt. you understand, but there was a
fryin pan along with us and by dinner
time we had caught fish enough to
make the. gravy smell monstrous good.
And in the main time I had managed to
work up a tremendius big appetite. I
felt, right then, like I mought eat a
stewed roastin ear patch and a baked
mule for dinner,.
After dinner we went on fishin and
foolin till way long in the sabank of the
evenin, and then took the back trail
and lit out for home. We had the
greatest plenty of fun and some luck,
' t+.ich I think the bulliest luck of all
.s that we didn't see no snakes that
.ay, you understand. But when I got
nome that night I went to bed, and I
stayed right there, off and on, for three
days and nights hand runnin.
A Platl raimily Talk.
One day whilst I was laid up for re
pairs-flat of my back and as helpless
and harmless as a baby-Mother lit in,
she did, and give me a plain family
talk. She had been monstrous good
and kind in fixin up the salts and snake
root and other compilements to pull me
through and save my life, and I couldn't
find it in my heart to sass her back.
And what was more, I jest naturally
lowed it mought be a blame good time
of year for me to say nothin.
"If anything I reckon it hurts me a
little the worst,-Rufus, for you to come
home and go to bed and curl up and git
sick," says she in openin up the con
fabulation. " But you can't blame
nobody with the wherefore and whence
ness of all this trouble and confusion
ment but your own fat fool self. It's
exactly what I lowed when you driv off
down the road with Will Tom Pickens
and little Bunk WVeatherford. To see
you runnin around over the whole entire
country, makin stump .speeches and
wvritin for the newspapers, anybody
would think that you ought to have
sense like quality folks, but sometimes
it does look to me like you have gpt the
most slimmest and pecurious way of
showin it of any man I have ever yet
' When I see you all donbled up there
with one of them sneakin paina it hurts
me; Rufus, but I wouldn't be a good,
true wife if 1 didn't tell you the naked,
unwashed truth in regards to yourself.
I have already before now told you and
told you-more times than I have got
fingers and toes-that your young mag
nolious days are over with and past.
You may feel young and try to look
young and make out like you are
young, but you aint. And for some
years I have took particular notice that
every time you take one of them colty
spells and go gallopin off and carryin
on like a youngster, then you come
home and go to bed. If it aint one
thing it is somethin else-the mully
grubs, or the rheumatiz, or the summer
complaints. It won't do, Rufus, it
wvon't begin to sorter half way do for a
man that has lived as much as you
have.
" Why in the name of creation don't
you keep company along with your own
gang-men that you was born and bred
and brung up with? As for that, I
reckon Will Tom Pickens and little
Bunk Weatherford aint got no more
baby teeth to shed, but still at the same
time they haven't lived more than half
as long-and not one-third as much-as
you have. It makes me plum weak and
weary,Rufus,to hear you talkin and goin
on about the sights "we boys" have
seen, and the fun "us boys" have had.
And the other day when I sw you
sailin off down the big road with the
other boys, as you were wont to say, I
knowcd good and well that the next
thing-in order was for me to go and git
the salts and snake root ready.
"I reckon no doubts a strong and

4 There is one thing in particular that
I would love to put you in mind of,
Rufus, and soon as ever you git up and
about you can take out your little note
book and set it down. Nature don't do
no slip-shod business on a credit. She
never did and she never will, and when
somever you go sad break into her
laws pay day is comin and you must
settle for your fun in spot cash."

tight that day. She most in generally
is right. It comes plum natural with
her to be right, and perfectly all right.
But then as to me-well, as yet I am
only fair tomiddlin, you understand. I
am a right smart like Joe Nick Stringer
was that time when he got into a sugar
barrel. When Joe Nick' vss nothifi but
a yearlin boy he had a tr~,pendius big
sweet tooth for sugar. In regard to
sugar he was about like a tool drinkin
good whisky-he dida't know when to
take out and quit.
Whereas and consequentially onest
tupon a time oldjnan Stringer took Joe
Nick to town, and took him to a grocery
store and showed him to the store
keeper.
"There is a boy that has never got
enough sugar since he was borned into
the world," says the old man, "and I
want him to git onegood bait before he
dies. Turn him loose in a sugar barrel
and lethim eat till he gits enough, than
weigh up what is left and charge the
backage to me."
So the storekeeper he took Joe Nick
into the back room, knocked the head
out of a sugar barrel and told him to
wade in. Late along in the shank of
the evenin the storekeeper went into
the back room 'after somethin, and
there was Joe Nick, you understand,
still packin away the sugar.
" Well, my little man," says the store
keeper, "'aint you got enough sugar
yet?"
" No sir," says Joe Nick, "I couldn't
say for certain that I have got enough,
but by the Hokus-pokus I nave done got
down to where it aint sweet."
Now I don't make out like I have got
enough of fishin and foolin around
down on Big Wolf Creek, you under
stand, but by gracious at any rates I
have done got to the pass where it aint
sweet no more.
Whiek was Which and Who was Who?
About the most strangest thing in
this wide and wicked world to me is to
find so many natural born fools amongst
smart men. Now in regards to sense,
Elder Newton and Bob Nettles stand
way up yonder in the settlement, but
they got into a terrible big disputation
*one day last week as to which side of a
railroad train-the inside or the outside
-is the highest when she runs around
a curve. I don't know which was which
nor who was who, but anyhow Bob
stuck to it that one side was the highest,
whilst Elder Newton maintains that
the other side was the highest. So
there they had it-up and down and
over and under-till finally at last they
worked up a little side betof three dol
lars and six bits as to which was which
and who was who.
Last Saturday they saddled up their
horses and lit out and rode fifteen miles
up the country to find the railroad and
see a train go round the curve in order
ment to settle the bet. They found the
railroad and a curve and then hunkered
down there and waited for a train to
run. That is all I know cxceptin that
Bob he win the bet and the Elder says
there aint no kick comin his way.
But me and Andy Lucas are now
thinkin right serious about takin out
papers of compellment to send Bob and
the Elder off to the crazy Siloam.

facturers have followed so closely the
same general lines of construction,
that one can hardly make a mistake in
the selection of a machine so long as
he is satisfied to stick to the standards.
But the man who allows himself to be

"new and novel," and invest in m#
chinery which embodies radical

may expect to soon have an out-of-date

There are no less than eight binders
of fferent manufacture used within
two miles of where I write, all giving
satisfaction, so far as I know, and
probably each owner could name one
or more points in which he considers
i ADLY FORMED UNFDLE.
his machine superior. But I care not
how perfect a machine may be,
it will never be an unqualified suc
cess nor add fresh laurels to its
reputation when it is run by a
man without sufficient ingenuity and
energy to properly hitch to and oper
ate a clod smasher. A great many bad
breaks and long delays are the legiti
mate results of carelessness, pure and
simple, and he who makes getting over
the ground the one prime object, to
the neglect of his machine and
the abuse of his team, may ex
pect frequent breakdowns and much
bad hick. The saying: "Care makes
luck" will apply to running a binder,
if to anything. If some little
thing gets out of order and the binder
begins to "buck," it doesn't pay to get
in a splutter and make matters worse
by changing things at random. I have
learned by experience that the best
plan is to keep a cool head and locate
the difficulty before remedying it, or
even trying to do so. Poor twine is re
sponsible for a deal of fussing in the
harvest field. It is nearly impossible
to do good, even work with poor, un
even twine. The best twine I ever
used was pure manilla; but so much co
called pure manilla is poor manilla,
that I would just as soon risk a good,
even grade of new, white sisal. As
machines become old they usually pre
fer a little coarser grade of twine than
in their younger days. Good reeling

laid down to govern position of reel for
varying kinds and conditions of grain.
This can be ascertained only by exper
imenting until best results are secured.
The reel should not rud parallel
with sickle, but the outer end
should stand several inches for
ward in order to place grain upon
platform with butts in advance of
heads, as the butts are always retard
ed by coming in contact with the fall
ing grain. In standing grain, the ma
chine should run about level. It takes
but a moment when starting up a
grade to tilt the machine forwvard, and
vice versa. It should be so well bal
anced that the tongue will play on the
neck yoke much of the time. Of course
this cannot always be done, particu
larly with the old five-horse steplad
der machines, but these are back num
bers now, and the new, low, sensible
ones do not have so much "swing" in
mid-air. It is cheaper and more hu
mane to carry the machine on its
wheels than on the horses' necks. It
should, therefore, be tilted back when
the driver leaves his seat; it it stands
long the binder may be shifted back

Treatlng Barbed Wire Wounds.
Barbed wire wounds are difficult to
heal. Like a wound caused by the
teeth of a saw, the edges being ragged,
requires a longer time to heal than a
square cut with smooth edges. The
swelling likely comes mainly from tak
ing cold in the wound, or the blood
may be out of condition. MLake a salve
of one ounce of calomel and a teacup
fuil of lard. Mix thoroughly and apply
twice a day. Tie a loose bandage
around the wound to keep out dust and
cold. It may be necessary to fasten
a string to the bandage. and tie around
his neck to hold it up. If the salve
does not heal the wound be must have
a blood purifier.--Rural World.

Before placing the hive see that it is

of broad foundation. Place the empty
hive on a summer stand. where it is to
set when the bees are in it. Be sure
the hives are painted, preferably
with white. Have the rear end the

Let the hives front to the east when
possible. Place them where the morn.

Do not have too big a front door for

caught by fastening an empty hive in

however, as it seems too much like
coaxing neighbors' bees away from

POULTRY ON FARMS.
It Yields More Satisfaetory Profits Thas
Any Other Stock.
The farmer has plenty of room on
his farm for poultry, and the land so
devoted will return as large, if not
larger profits than an equal area
planted to a crop or used for other
stock. Cheap houses can be built to
shelter a hindred or more fowls, which
will bring in the cash in the winter
season by producing eggs, thus large*
ly aiding him to purchase many neces
saries while waiting for his crops to
grow. There is but little risk of loss
in keeping hens if they receive only q
part of the attention bestowed on
animals, and a very large percentage
upon the cost is the certain return that
may be realized by a farmer, on a
small scale, where the business is con
ducted properly. There is more profit
in raising choice poultry and making
a specialty of eggs, considering the
cost and outlay, and which can be had
annually, than from any other sources,
not excepting cows, pigs or sheep, and
yet the animals are fed and cared for
at an expenditure for labor that would
be considered appalling if bestowed
on the hens, though the hens pay cash
dividends daily for all they receive.
Farmers would do well to look into this
matter, and now is the time to consider
it. Good fowls of any of the improved
breeds may now be had at a very resa
sonable price, and we call the atten
tion of those who have the facilities
for keeping fowls of taking advantage
of their opportunities. -Prairie Farmer.
AMONG THE POULTRY.
SUNFLOWER seed add luster to the

OATS are one of the very best feeds
for moulting hens.
THE Pekin ducks develop early and

GEESE thrive on plenty of good pas

IF ducklings are .exposed to wet

IT is well to remember that as the
