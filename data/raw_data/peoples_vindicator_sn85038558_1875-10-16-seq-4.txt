Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
stable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom.without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR BIT
riRs t" Our answer is, that they
remove' the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers hit health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of Via
oaa JlBtrrsas in, healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or luflannnuatiou of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
