The Editors and Proprietors of the
Shreveport Times have each hben
presented with a fine gold watch by
the citizens of Shreveport, as a to
ken of the esteem in whicl the peo
ple hold them. We can say tht tht they
richly deserve all praise, for the
Times has been, and is a power in the
land, and it should he cherished by
all true Loaisianans as the fearless
defender of the rights of our down
trodden citizens.
The people of Natchitoches will
have no officials for some tinfe to
come, for the batch "ground out" for
us by Wells and his Returning Board,
will probably draw pay and reside in
New Orleans, but they can never
come here in any capacity. Courts
of arbitration, we suppose, will be
established to facilitate business, and
Committees of public safety organi
zed to put down crime, both will be
found to work better than Radical
courts.
Rain has been falling in copions

We have received a letter of A. H.

Times is handed te the mail rider eve

We want the Times and must have
it as soon as possible after issue.

Intimidation in Natchitoches.
We pbilish in full elsewhere the
aftidavits of citizens of wards 5 and
6, black and white, las evidencee of
what they know with regard to in
tinmidalian of colorhed vo:ter.s by
White Leaguers in those wards. It

tration and election of 1874, in Natch
itclhes, save on the part of Packard
and his U. S. Depnty Marsh:ala and
U. S. troops, who overawed and over
ran itn front oti end of the parish to
another, arrested citizens without
warrant or law, nupo;i charges known
to be ftdse, simply for the purpose of
driving away from the polls the
white and colored members of the
People's party. In truth of this stlte
ment we have fowarded the atfidavits
of fifty-three white citisens who were
driven from voting at wards 11 and
10, by A. Phillip Blreda, and J. Ernest
Breda, the one a candidate for Coro
ncr, and the other for Parish Judge,
upon the Radical ticket, and acting
as U. S. Deputy Marshals with possee
of U. S. Cavalry at the polling places
upon the day of election, these sworn
statements will be submitted to the
Congressional Committee for their
consideration and are dulticate oriji.

ing .Bioard.
We venture to say that the election
of 1874, was conducted on the part of
our people, with all moderation and
fairness, we had command of the
power to establish polling pl;ces, and
coueld have placed theam !io as to de
ter in a great measure, the colored
people fretn having an opportn:ity to
vote, as has been done by all the
Radicals sinee reconstruction, for
there has ne'ver been a polling precinct
in any whLite ward since .l.es, on the
contrary, all voting places were upon
the rivers, and ill thick settled negro
neighborhoods. The people's Police
Jury of 1874, established the voting
lprecitlcts in every ward in the parish,
with two boxes in Natchitoches, ma
king thirteen places where citizens
could vote, and we defy the Radicals
of Natchitoches to point to a single
election in which they had over six
boxes, and they all on Red River-not
one in the hills, where reside the mass
of the 1500 white men of Natchito
ches parish. All the Radicals here
know this to be so, and what the
honest people of Natchitaches` de
mand, and inltemnd to enLforce, is a hear
ing of their statenmnt of the case.
For six long years have we been rob
bed and plundered by just such men
as get up these afflidavits. Kellogg,
Clinton, and tlhe entire radical riing in
New Orleans, are well aware of the
condition the property owners of
Natchitoches have been subjected to
by such men as Myers, Boulit, Blunt,
Raby, Pierson, preda and others, and
in the fulness of his lies, the Govr
ernor (?) held up his hands in holy
horror at thile tale of our grievances,
and promised us speedy relief, which
as usnual lie never fulfilled-on the
contrary, hlie proceeds to saddle upon
us the same men who are responsible
for the evils under which we suffer,
and of which we demand relief. It
is useless to ask us as men to con
tinually submit to these outrages&; to
continue to allow ourselves plunder
ed, insulted and murdered. It is de
manding an impossibility, contrary
to nature, and we cannot consent to
it. Let us of Natchitoches, ask the
independent press of America, what
ire we of Louisiana ta do in the
event Congress fails to afford us re
liefI Wdehi Congress wcill fail to do,
as sure as the sun sets. Are we to set
camly and see our homes taken from
us, ourselves and families driven beg
gers into exile Or shall we show
the world that although matched
against villainy and might, we have
still virtue enough to defend our lib
erty and our firesides to the last gasp ?
This may be all sentiment and patti
otic enough, some will say, hut poli
oy demands something else. Policy,
that cold and dumb idol, is poor shel
ter for a people in the last throes of
their existence, for consolation. Poli
cy was what Patrick Henry, Wash
ington, Adams, and thie thousands of
patriots of our Revolution fought
against; had they but listened to tlhe
independent nmen of thie Colonies, the
i freedom of America would have been
an ,ntried theory, and on thie grave
of their hopes the patriot could have
well written the epitaph of Macawber.
H ow long would the people of New
York or of any State North, stand 8
per cent taxes, to pay debts contracted
for no plurpose under leaven Millions
of money spent for a pariah whosa
people were ailnost ruined by the
war, and not one public imuprovem',ilt
to show where the cost went. No
Rail Roads, no Canals, no Bridgfs,
the people all paupers and no poor
house, thieves rolling, in wealth and
honest people starving, is a colored
but a true picture of oar condition
to-day. Let all our friends in the
North hlear in min'l that the State
debt of r."i,Q(0,(()O incurred by Radi
cal legislation is not a drop in the 1
bucket to what the people have hlnad
squandered for them. The parish of
Natchitoehes alone, with lfroperty
depreciated from t millions in 18i1,,
to 1 million in 1874, owes three hun
dred and fifty thousand 4dolars at
least, all of which has been rsent by
Radicals and negroes, and put in the
pockets of favorites. If every actre
of land in this parish was sold to-day,
the proceeds would not pay our share
of the State debt and what the par
ish owes, and still we are asked to let
this state of affairs continue to exist
until such tiie'at the returning sense
of the people at 'large will afford no
relief. We propose to bear and suf
fer as long as we can do to with rea- 1
poet and no further. When we con- I
nider that the end has been reached I
we will then act in a manner befit- t
ting our manhood, and care lint lit
tle what outside people may think or t
do in the matter. Let the iudepen- j
dentit press read the a avits, of fir t
unknown men, upon Rhich wards 5 1
andl 6 were thrown oat by the Return
ing Board, and then turn to the sworn
statements before a Republican Clerk,
of colored and white voters, of iRadi
cal Supervisors and Commissioners of I
election, and remember that the judqe
to whom. we apply for redress i, the rer!,
man i who is the fratner of the fiorgedi
tdocument, and then tell us to whomn
are we, to appeal for justice. "People
of the North, "put yourselves in oure
pilace" before you pass judguient, and
then say to us what to do.
Gone but not Forgotten.
Prince Boullt, the prime mover and
instigator in all the corruption,
abuse and villainy, under which the
white pe:'ple of Natchitoches parish
have, for the past four years been
groaning, departed hence per Steam
er Garry Owen, on Monday last.
lie leaves us execrated by every
thing virtuous in our community, and
his name, D. II. Boullt, will be re
membered among coming generations
as that of a monster, and synonimous
with thievery and murder.
Coming to this parish years ago,
lie as a young man made many friends
and was received in Â¶ertain social
circles until his alliance with a quad
roon woman, by whom he has a large
family, when he took that social level
to which such conduct would entitle
him. During the war he was a
stannch Confederate, and after only,
when he associated himself in the
capacity of advocate and member of
the VWest gang of ent-throats and
robbers, did his true character show
itself. He is responsible far the mar
der of Lt. Butts of the U. S. Army
in 1866, and received his share of the
"swag" from the cold blooded mur
der. and robbery of men, womenu and
children, by J. R. West and his crew.
Of all this he was publicly charged
by Gen'l. McLaughlin of the U. S.
army, and the facts can be substantia
ted.
But his cowardly soul was filed
with its measure of delight when he
secured the position of tax collector
and leader in the Radical party, when
hlie might rob and lmurder and, not be
amenable. It has been estimated that
he amassed a fortune of over two
hundred thousand dollars in five
years, with an office which honestly
conducted would yield about $5000
per annum.
We have done with him thank God,
'"depart in peace ye cursed," we will
never forget your villainy--your out
rages upon us. May you live exe
crated and die damned.
We are pleased to note the passage
of an ordinance by our City Council,
which provides that fifty per cent of
all taxes and licenses, shall in future
be paid in currency, instead of City
Script, as usual. The currency thus
obtained to be sold monthly at the
Mayor's office, to thle highest bidder
for corporation warrants.
We can but applaud this as a wise
provision, for thq collection of a part
of the taxes in enurrency, is in itself, a
step towards a solution of the prob
lem of the entire liquidation of the
city indebtedness. The money thus
taken in can be used to redeem, at
least 200 per cent more in warrante
than we could hope to, in absorbing
in the way of taxes on standing ir
rants, when under ordinary adminis
tration the eupenditure for city ex
penses is nearly equal to the receipts.
We congratulate Mayor DeVargas
on the manner of his conducting our
municipal affairs, and in him, and a
majority of the board, our people
can boast of having an honest city
administration.

GLORIOUS NEWS.
The radicals are four members short.
The conservatives are all here but
one, giving us a clear majority, but it
is rumored the returning board is in
session and will return the defeated
radicals from DeSoto and Winn to
give radicals control. All the radical
members were housed in the State
House by nine o'cloek last night, and
all the doors but one barricaded. A
bar room and boarding house have
been improvised fof them in the up
per story. There are also about thir
ty yellow girls who board and lodge
the radical members ; thus your Chris
tian statesman, Levisee, is the right
man in the right place. The stheet
on all sides of the State I[Ioue are
garded by the police, and no citizens
are allowed to approach nearer thle
corners; the troops are abrut 1~.1fi
strong occupy the stieet~s, froni which
the citizens are excluded ; thus the
State House is envirooned witlh ftederal
bayonets; two-thirds of the metro
politans last night refued to act as
militia and all efforts of 'Packard to
organize a militia have faiiled and
the sole dependence of the fraud is
upon the troops. I think therefore
there can be no fight as I have osecu
no disposition to fight the troops.
The issue is solely between the fede
ral authorities and the people of Lou
isiana. If the returaing board does
not interfere we have the House but
don't hope for anything. It is now the
hour for assembling. Thousands of
people are gathering in the vicinity
of the State Hlouse. Will telegraph

Editor Vindicator :
In your issue of last Sat raday, yov,
make a demand of the redeit Editor
of the IIepublican, as to whett,er he he
lieves the Conservatives curried this
State. This demand is mi:ule on an
article published in the lepqbliren,
of date Dec. 2', 1874. eintitled "Sugar
Piatulls for lepnblhiclans to suck."
The article in question was copied
ft rm the Donaldson:ville Ci;ef, to
which paper it should have been cred
ited.
It is impossible for me to state
whether the State has been carried
odr one party or the other, as I I;ave
no definites or ofticial iuforutiion re- I
garding the State vote.
I am nut one who. upholds wrong
doindg, no smatter from what soutme
it may enmanate. Believing always
that "honesty is the best policy," and
never having belonged to ring's!
cliques, or combinations, to leftamue
thie people. I am still a friend to the
M asges.
For years I have been made a pack
horse for Republican brains. Di)uitng
that time I have discovered that all
is not "gold that glitters."
Politicians are prejudiced, lumore or
less, according to their peculiar be
liefs. Always conservative in my
views, I have never advocated ex
treme measures. If I have erred in
judgment, I have not done so foru
pueseut circumstances. No upholder
of wrong-doing amng Repiub!icans,
still am 1 less a defender of the wrongs 1
of those who oppose themn.
When such papers as the New York
Tribune, New York Timnes, and Chica
go Tribune, all administration and
lRepublikan journals, repudiate the
acts of the Republican party, it is
time for honest men in that party,
be they black or white, to look about
them and see what will colnduce to
their heat interest.
Should the present political comnbi
nationsof this State lead to warlike
demonstration, I hope to be found on
the side of the people.
Truly yours,
