There are times when a sense of
outrage precludes the hope of finding
words to express indigna
tion, a time when one al
most becomes enraged at

the very patience of our
people in submitting to wrong after
wrong. iSueh a time arrived last
week, when the wheat market soared
skyward, as a result of skilled, un
scrupulous manipulation. James A.
Patten practically “cornered” the
market, a thing which had seemed
virtually impossible. As a result of
the bull movement in the Chicago
wheat pit, Mr. Patten has cleaned up
many millions. Likewise, hundreds
of bankers are bankrupt, and thous
ands upon thousands of people feel
the pinch of more desperate poverty
than ever. Flour has gone up in
price several dollars per barrel, with
the prospect of continued increase.
In the big cities, baker’s bread is the
chief food of the very poor and stale
loaves, at a penny or two less than
the fresh bread is eagerly sought.
Baker’s bread and a little milk is the
food of babies. What it means,
therefore, when the retail price of
bread doubles in the slums is—star
vation.
Geo. W. Wickersham, our distin
guished, able and patriotic Attorney
General, discovers no law whereby
Mr. Patten and his ilk can be molested
in their cheerful amusement of taking
food out of the mouths of little ones.
This lack of law distresses Mr. Wick
ersham terribly. A corporation
henchman, a sycophant of Wall
street, a creature elevated to his
position in order to restore the “con
fidence” of the interests that they
would not be disturbed by prosecu
tion, Mr. Wickersham is very sorry
he has no convenient weapon with
which he may injure the Chicago
wheat gamblers.
There being no law Mr. Patten has
broken, obviously he is a law-abiding
citizen, and a moral man, no doubt.
When he gets through with his pelf,
he may endow colleges and establish
libraries and do other noble deeds, for
which the public will be duly grate
ful.
Why have we no law in this coun
try to protect us from the human
wolves who prey upon the necessa
ries of life and coin profits out of the
blood of the helpless people? Why
do not the “best people” recognize
and shrink from men of the Patten,
the Rockefeller and the Gould type
as accessories to suicide and murder
ers by indirection?
The Senate now takes up the
Payne bill, —or what was left of it
by the house, and presents
a number of changes. Tea
and coffee remain on the
free list, while crude cocoa,
The
Aldrich
Bill
upon which a three cents
per pound duty was proposed, goes
back on the free list. This is a great
concession ostensibly, to the ‘ 1 work
ingmen ’s breakfast.” The Dingley
rates, much lower than the Payne
schedules, on women and children’s
gloves and cotton hosiery are restored.
Iron ore, which was free in the Payne
bill, is given a duty of 25 cents a
ton, 15 cents less than the Dingley
rate. The steel schedule retains
most of the reductions propsed by
the Payne bill.
Rough lumber —in which everybody
is interested, is to carry duty, while
hard woods —for expensive finishing
and furniture are free.
The Sugar Trust obtains iall it
wants, without a fight. Sugar being
a necessary, and the poor man con
suming as much as the rich man, of
course the tax must be borne by the
people.
Spices are put on the free list. Al
most anybody could get along in a
pinch without nutmegs, pepper, cinna
mon, etc., so this tariff concession
cuts no real ice.
Tobacco remains about the same.
There will be a duty proposed on
coal, a vital necessity. This was pro
posed free in the Payne bill.
Rates on silks, spirits and wines
are increased. If anything should be
increased, these three things can
stand it more than anything else, be
ing luxuries.
All considered, the relief appeal's
nowhere in sight. There will be free
hides, and high tariff on manufac
tured goods in leather, which will re
dound to the benefit of the New Eng
land shoe manufacturer. Fuel, cloth
ing and food are not to be cheaper to
the consumer.
Or, we about forgot! The duty on
sugared buscuits is reduced from 50
to 20 per cent. The squadrons laden
with “frosted” tea-cakes and so
forth, which have heretofore doubt
less been diverted from these shores
by tariff duties, will now unload their
sugared ballast for the delectation of
the multitude. An ocean voyage will
do them much good. As everyone
knows, several weeks in damp storage
adds greatly to the value of all kinds
of pastry. This is, indeed, a tremen
dous blow to the sugar people, the
biscuit trust, etc.
Although it is estimated that the
revenue that will be raised under
the new tariff bill will ap
proximate the enormous
sum of $300,000,000, it is

not possible to compute
the fabulous sum that will be extorted
from the American people by the
protected interests. And other means
are being discussed for meeting what
is prophesied will be a deficit between
the government revenues and the ex
penses. For this purpose an income
tax is being advocated, mostly by the
Democratic 'senators, notably Bailey,
of Texas. Because a few states now
have inheritance taxes, they argue
that it would be futile even to try
to pass a national inheritance tax bill.
This, of course, is absurd on its face,
since it would easily be found pos
sible to so adjust the taxes that no
one would have to pay twice over. As
for the income tax, that is a meas
ure that commends itself to equity,
although the real bar to its operation

will lie in the fact that if passed, it
would be fought to a finish by the
wealth of the country, who would have
the former declaration of the Su
preme Court upon which to rely as
to the unconstitutionality of the bill.
However, it is known of all men that
the decree of the court was very “pe
culiar.” It would do no harm to try
for the income tax again, if the trial
is made honestly. Just why Senator
Bailey and others should have person
ally gone to Taft and whispered n
his ear that no inheritance tax bill
could be passed, when all seemed
plain sailing for such a measure to
pass, must be left of the gentlemen
of the Standard Oil taint to explain.

tries have been building
Dreadnaughts as fast as they possi
bly can, both are worse than merely
financially embarrassed, and both are
unsure that the means they are tak
ing to prepare for this war consti
tute the best possible means, for the
reason that the newer battleships
render the bulk of the above horizon
the vision of a better type of Dread
naught, and the strong probability
that, if war is deferred for some few
years longer, airships will have been
perfected to such a point that a fleet
of the latter would readily demolish
the finest navy aoflat.
Therefore, each nation really pants
for a test of strength. A state of in
sanity similar to this, if existing be
tween two countries, whose territor
ies were no larger than a bed quilt,
and whose “armies” aggregated sev
eral dozen barefoot soldiers, say, in
South or Central America, would
cause much big talk of intervention,
pacification, etc. England, Germany
and America have been great preserv
ers of the peace, when it came to
dictating to the little fellows, but at
present all three are too busily en
gaged in jingoism to heed the abyss
into which their present policies are
plunging the masses of their people.
Ruinous extravagance, increasing de
ficits not met by increasing taxation
and, worst of all, the cultivation of
the worst possible spirit in the youth
of these nations —the craze for fight
ing, like blind brutes, in a groundless
quarrel, all contribute to make the
civilization of the era a shame and a
mockery.
While these hereditary foes are

apparently means a
deadly civil war. Upon
the party of progress
and reform, known as the Young
Turks, devolves the grim necessity to
maintain by force that which they
gained so recently and so bloodlessly.
Whether they can do this or not will
depend upon so many conflicting ele
ments that the result is beyond con-
jecture. It will be remembered that
the last force to be permeated with
patriotism consisted of the army of
the Sultan. Long had the Young
Turks struggled towards bringing
about a decent constitutional govern
ment. When finally disaffection with
the conditions reached the army it
self, the power of the reactionaries
was paralyzed. Yet there remained
abundant material upon which they
could work, and doubtless have
worked, to re-establish the ancient
conditions and it is believed that the
Sultan gave way to the demands of
the Young Turks, granted a constitu
tion and graced the first parliament
with his lean and sallow presence
from the very good reason only that
he had to do so; and on Tuesday last
the result of his subsequent machin
ation shook the Ottoman empire, when
a portion of the troops mutinied
against the regulations of the Young
Turks’ party, upon the excuse that
they had been hampered in their re
ligious practices. The Mohammedan
is exceedingly jealous of his preroga
tives in this regard and Abdul was
wily enough to play upon this chord.
The coup d’etat worked, but not in
the way the Sultan doubtless hoped.
The overthrow of the constitution was
not accomplished. The Young Turks
rallied from the blow and, thousands
strong, are marching upon Constanti
nople. Delegations have been sent to
“explain” the mutiny, to assure them
that the constitution is in no danger,
but meanwhile the Sultan’s private
yacht, steam up, rides on the Bospho
rous, ready to save his precious hide
if the Young Turks enter his city and
restore, in blood, that which he tried
to abolish. The situation is utterly
chaotic, dispatches are censored and
conflicting. Abdul Hamid has clearly
sown the wind and that he must reap
the whirlwind seems inevitable, since
he can not depend upon the loyalty
of any of the troops. Indeed, it is
stated, a vivid commentary upon
conditions there,—-that he is depend
ing for his personal security upon two
Americans.
The worst feature of all is that
the excitement has vented itself in
many places in unbridled race and
religious hatred, and wholesale
slaughter. It is believed that per
haps two thousand Armenians have
been butchered, while riot and muti
ny have broken out simultaneously at
so many points it is impossible that
a carnival of bloodshed will not in
sue, unless the Young Turks can
speedily regain control of the situa
tion.
