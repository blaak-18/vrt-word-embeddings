THE CO-OPERATION CLUB.
Dear Sir:—l thought I would
write you to let you know my appre
ciation of The Jeffersonian, and also
that I endorse your views religiously,
as well as politically.
I have voted for you every time
that I’ve had the opportunity, and
will continue to be your admirer and
supporter as long as you keep to the
line, which I know you will do, as I
have never caught you in a wabble
yet. I would be more than glad to
have you send me six copies of your
weekly (or as many as you wish to
send), as I would take a delight to
hand them to my neighbors.
Your friend,
Leos, Ga. Z. A. KERRIMER.
HERE’S ANOTHER CHARTER
MEMBER OF THE CO-OPERA
TION CLUB.
My Dear Mr. Watson:—l sincerely
wish to congratulate you on the mar
velous increase in the circulation of
the two Jeffs. It seems they have no
boundary lines, but from the Atlantic
to the Pacific the gospel of reform,
in both Church and State, they
preach is arousing all true Ameri
cans to the danger confronting us.
I am fully convinced that you are the
modern Moses, called of God to lead
the common people from financial
bondage. You have my earnest
prayers and best wishes for your
continued success. Send me six
copies of paper for distribution.
Yours to the end,
B. H. BROWN.

A VALUED ENDORSEMENT.
Dear Sir:—Seeing and hearing the
comment that is being made by many
superficial readers and thinkers upon
the position you take on the Mission
question, we, members of the Scien
tific Society of the Georgia Normal
College and Business Institute, de
sire iYi this manner to express our
gratification for the manly way in
which you have exposed the system,
and to assure you that you have our
hearty sympathy and co-operation.
We believe that the reason Mr.
Ellis and others take such a contra
dictory stand against you is that
they realize that the death of the
present system means an extinction
of many of their fat positions, and
for their own personal benefit, and
not the Oriental heathen’s, do they
so vigorously assault you.
Believing that disobeyance to un
just methods, regardless of what
they may be and whom they may en
rich, to be obedience to God, we wish
for you world-wide success, and as
sure you we, who can lay down all
selfishness and see the real truth,
though it be below the gilded sur
face, will follow you with the same
faithfulness and fidelity that prompt
ed Caesar’s tenth legion in his Gallic
Wars.
Very truly yours,
E. G. WEATHERS,

DEMOCRACY AND POPULISM.
Dear Sir: —The Democratic party
in Georgia, in common with all par
ties are hard losers. I know this by
personal contact with the Democrats
in this city. There is hardly a day
that I am not told that you are a
traitor to the party, and that you
could have anything the party could
give if you would come back. I don’t
agree with this, as to the traitor
part, and if you will put the young
generation of Watsonites wise to the
different flops of the Democratic
party and yourself for the last
twenty-five years you will confer a
favor upon many who are unable to
retain the different platforms of the
Democrats and Populists in their
minds, and be ready at a moment’s
notice to take up the gauntlet in
your behalf. There are thousands
that understand, but there are tens
of thousands who don’t know; they
would have a change of heart, should
they see the different platform planks
in both parties.
Respectfully,
CHAS. KIMBALL.
Answer.
Have never betrayed any individ
ual, or any party. Was elected to
Congress on the Alliance platform,
over a rival who made his race on the
regular national Democratic plat
form. Consequently, I felt it my
duty to adhere to the principles for
which I stood during my campaign.
By a referendum vote in my- Con
gressional district, I was instructed
by every county but one, to stand by
those principles, independent of the
caucus dictation of the Democratic
party. Consequently, I felt it my
duty to do so; and my conduct was
ratified by every one of the counties
that had been in my district at the
time of my election, excepting Rich
mond. My district had been changed
by the Legislature before I sought a
re-election at the hands of the peo
ple. Two of my strongest counties
had been taken away from me, and
two counties in which I was unknown
had been substituted. Nevertheless,
I carried one of these new counties.
Thus, with my district changed to
make it harder for me to carry it,
I was endorsed by nine counties out
of eleven.
My position has always been that
of a Jeffersonian Democrat. Never
have I voted for Republican policies.
Always, have I fought the Republi
cans. My accusation against the na
tional Democratic party, is that it
has departed from the principles of
our forefathers. The principles enun.
ciated under the platforms of the
Democratic party, prior to the Civil
War, are practically the same as
those which I have stood for. My
battle has been to bring the people
back to the old Democratic doctrines.
The battle has been long and it has
cost me a great deal, in every re
spect; but things are coming my
way at last, and the people are be
ginning to realize that it was for
THEM that I was fighting all the
time. They are beginning to realize
that the principles for which I stood
—and now stand— are necessary to
the salvation of the masses and the
restoration of the government to
genuine Democracy.
A HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL OB
JECTS TO OBJECTIONS.
Dear Sir:—l’ve departed from the
teachings of my youth and read after
you to a considerable extent during
the past few years, and I’ve enjoyed
you articles. I feel compelled to say,
however, that I disagree with you as
to the present election law in Geor
gia. I fail utterly to see the trap for
C>l)e
the country voters. I think the
new law a direct shot at the
venal city voter, who never
registers until the ward heeler
carries in his name with those taken
from the tomb-stones and city direc
tories of other cities.
To my mind it seems impossible
that any white man in the State could
be ignorant of the new law and the
general outline of its texture.
Every paper, favorable or unfavor
able to the law, has been thunder
ing the call, “Register, register.”
From the city dailies down to the pot
metal weeklies the call has gone
forth. Every country store, Farmers’
Union meeting, street corner gang,
and every possible assembly has
heard the law “cussed” and discuss
ed, and with all this in view if the
voter then neglects his privilege can
he blame any one severely if his
name fails to appear on the registra
tion sheet?
As to requiring each voter to vote
in the precinct in which he is regis
tered, there can be no objection un
less a man wishes to vote twice in
one contest.
If we are ever to have a pure bal
lot in Georgia, those who want it
must expect to go to some inconve
nience to secure it.
If I believe what is wrong, gladly
would I be taught what is right.
In closing, I wish to thank you for
removing the scales from my eyes on
the subject of Foreign Missions; in
fact, you’ve won me on everything
but the registration law subject.
Jakin, Ga. D. L. GIBSON.
Answer.
Prof. Gibson leaves out of sight
certain features of the law, which, to
my mind, are extremely objection
able.
(1) No express provision is made
for the registration of any voter who
doesn’t pay taxes.
(2) After the registration lists
have been made and purged, they
are filed in the Clerk’s office, not
iater than the sth of June; after
which time not a single name can go
on or off. Inasmuch as the Primary
cannot legally be held earlier than
the first week in August, Prof. Gib
son will see that the effect of the law
is to give vote buyers sixty days to
study the list and work on purchas
able voters. In other words, the tak
ing away of sixty days from those
who ought to have registered and did
not, has no other consequence than
to give to vote-buyers the best chance
they have ever had to work on the
men who have registered.
He is in error, I think, as to the
class of men who are sure to regis
ter. A white man who has been get
ting from $lO to SIOO for his vote,
is the very fellow that is sure to be
the “early bird” in the matter of
registration. Knowing that he will

have nothing to sell, unless he does
register, he will be sure to qualify
himself at the first opportunity. On
the contrary, the honest man who
cannot be bought, may lose his vote
through mere carelessness. Os course,
this is his own fault, but laws ought
to be made with reference to what
we know about human nature.
(3) The law will certainly dis
franchise many young men who, un
der a more liberal statute, should,
on coming of age, qualify themselves
to vote. While it is true that the
constitutional amendment provides
for this, no provision is made for
them in the new election law; and,
therefore, the constitutional amend
ment is up in the air, inoperative—
to that extent.
(4) As the men in the city can be
more readily repaired in neglect of
registering, than the voter who lives
out a distance in the country, there
is the discrimination which works
hardships upon the farming class. In
the fall and winter, many a man,
following established habits, will
send his money by some neighbor
who is going to town to pay his own
taxes, and who will pay those of
friends of the same community. The
man who pays his taxes in that way,,
of course, intends to go to town some
time later, sign the voters’ book and
