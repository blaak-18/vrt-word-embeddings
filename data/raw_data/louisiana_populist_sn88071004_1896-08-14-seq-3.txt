Capt. C. H. Teal of Colfax, was
in Natchitoches Tuesday, greeting
his many friends with pleasant
smiles. He was on his way home
from Hot Sprints where he as
spent a few weeks outing. The
Captain is a staunch Democrat, but
liberal and broad minded, and an
enthusiastic silver man. He says
nearly every one he. saw on his
trip is for silver and, Bryan, and
believes they will sweep the coun
try. Long live such Democrats as
Capt. Teal.

To give the committee time to n
n report the convention took a recess I
s till ,, o'clock. n
The convention was ciled to or- s
tdi. r at , ::3i and the committee filed
two reports :
Judge Gunhv read the report of s
tlhe majority. which was as follows:
"lie it resolved, that we dee-i
1i nounce the leaders of the Demo- r
t- cratic party of Louisiana as in 0
(l league with fraud and in covenant ti
with crime. In order to secure e
the state government which they
hold today the D 'mocratic leaders f,
d violated every provision of the tl
a registration and election laws which a
r they themselves enacted, resorted p
to every species of crime against e
a free ballot, suppressed free speech p
and the right of public assemblage,
n committed fraid, perjury, forgery h
n and theft, and finally employed the t
militia to make these nefarious and
odious crimes effective. 4
"We declare that the right to a c
8 free ballot and an honest count is Ii
f the first essential of free govern- ti
mont, and the demand for this right ci
is paramount to all other issues un- ai
til honest elections are secured be- ii
yond all question. The fact that al
the Democrats in their Chicago si
platform did not dare to uphold the g
Sright to a fair ballot shows that e
) they are wedded to the system of V
ballot box stuffing in the bouth.
f We den mnce both old partiess as
utterly incapable of grasping end n,
dealing with the problems and a,
emergencies that have arisen du- st
s ring the past twenty-five years. ,
They have alternately held posse,- C
s sion of the national government o,
and given us a series of panics, f
depressions and experiments which t
- have guined the prosperity of all t
1 classes of worthy citizens. They 1.
- have converted public office into a t(
selfish perquisite and made politics
a mere scranmble for spoils. The
evils from which the people have
suffered have been due chiefly to a
I depraved and degenerate sense of W
officlal duty, whose blighting in
fluence has extinguished patriotism f
among the leaders of both old par
ties.
"Under these conditions a new
party with new principles, new ci
methods, new men and new inspi- tb
rations for the welfare of the peo
ple has become a historic necessity. in
Any step which would endange r
the independence and final triumph
of the People's party would be
treason to the dearest hopes of hu
manity. We denounce both of r
parties as being under plutocratic a[
and British influence, the one in C(
its commercial policy and the other
in its financial policy. We de
nounce the Democratic policy of
placing raw material on the free
list while protecting manufacturers U
as favoring the classes against the
masses, and we denounce the pro
hibitory duties of the Republicans 1
which foster trusts and monoplies.
Between these two extremoties, i
there is a safe road for statesman- ti
ship. We denounce the goldbug
ism and centralism of the Republi-w
cans and the lawlessness and selfish
greed of the Democrats, and de- io
clare that prosperity, peace and *
justice can never be restored to this
country by the success of either to
of the old parties, which have long lo
since abandoned their original prin
ciples and are honeycombed with C
corporate greed and corruption.
These old parties are now divided
and the shattered columns are train- A
ing their artillery on each other.
Now is the time for the Populists O0
to stand ubited and firm and chargeV
all along the line.
"We heartily indorse the plat
form of principles adopted by the
national People's party convention Fi
at St. Louis, and we declare our
fealty to the ticket there nominated, E
which all tha friends of free silver
can sincerly support. Both of the o
nomminees are not only in favor of
free silver, but of incaseod vol
ume of currency, whicF is abso
lutely necessary for the relief of
the toiling- masses and prodlucers
of this country. Free silver is not
the only, nor the principal issue of
the Populist platform, but in a
spirit of patriotism and concession
we have nominated a national tick
et which all honest and earnest ad- A
vocates of free silver of all par
ties can support without humlia
tion or inconsistencv. On this
platform we invite and demand the by
votes of all sincere silver men in
Louisiani for the electors nomina- L
ted by this convention. Br
Sirned: H. L. Brian, Jos. Klein- i
peter, A. W. Stewart, A. T. Nel
son, F. S. Lyons, N. V. Bush, A. ,e
A. Gunby.
F. L. West then read the mninori- J
ty report as follows :

d "'We indorse the nomination of

: We delland a free and untram

t the surest method of reaching that

y "We favor a reduction of official
s fees and salaries to correspond with
e the reduced wages of the laborer
b and the reduced prices of lalor's
d product and we demand strict hon

' "LWe pledge ourselves to always

- inauguration of an era of progress
It and prosperity. We, the under
o signed, respectfully offer the fore
e going as a minority report. Sign
t ei : 1. J. Mills, chairman ; F. L.
f West."
On motion, speeches were limi
ted to 5 minutes, and the disc'is
sion was opened on the motion to
adopt the minority report as a sub
stitute for the motion to adopt the
majority relport. I. J. Mills of
Calcasieu, led the debate in favor
t of the minority, and II. L. Brian
for the majority. The vote was
taken by roll call and the nunori
1 ty was lost by a vote of 4ti nays to
Y 11 yeas. The majority report was
a then adopted.
The following resolution by
Judge A. A. Gunby, which had
passed the committee unanimously
was read and adopted.
SResolved, that in view of the
appalling calamity which has be
fallen the drouth-stricken region
of this State, we express our deep
sympathy for the sufferers and ap
r peal to the public spirited and
' charitable to institute measures for
Stheir relief.
-W. C. Flynt offered the follow
ing as a substitute for a similar
resolution reported by the commit
tee, which substitute was adopted :
Resolved, that a committee of 1
rom each Congressional District,
and 2 at large be selected by this
convention, with the chairman of
the State Central Committee as ex
officio chairman of same, which
shall be authorized to make such
changes in the electoral ticket put
up by this convention as may bc
come necessary by any action of
the .national committee of the Poo
ple's party.
Ju.lge Gunby then moved to go
into the selection of an electoral
ticket.
Mr. Booth offered a sulbstitute
which was declaredl out of order,
when he appealed from the decis
ion of the chair and the chair was
sustained.
The convention then proceeded

lion. Thomas. Scott. Adams, ex
secretary of state, alter a short ill
ness, died at his residence in Clin
ton, Friday morning. Capt. Adams
was 56 years of age. lie was born
in South Carolina, but had resided
in East Feliciana parish since 1855.
lie was a high-toned, brave and
honorable gentleman, and by those
who knew him intimately and well
he was dearly beloved. Hle was a
devoted and loving husband and
father, and a true friend. Capt.
Adams was well-known throughout
the state and for the past six years
he was one of the most conspicious
characters in Louisiana politics.
He was in every sense and mean
ing of the term a truly good and
upright man and in every parish in
the state the intelligence of his
death will be received with deep
regret.-Ex.
Cures Nervous Troubles and
Indigestion.
Mr. W. T. Nelson, president of
the Second National Bank, of Jack
son, Tenn says : "For indiges
tion and nervous trouble, I would
rather give up any remedy than
King's Royal Germetuer. As a
nerve tranquilizer and restorative,
it is all that can be desired. It is
not a narcotic in any sense, but
produces the happiest effects upon
the disordered nervous system. I
consider it an snvaluable remedy,
And have for several years been
recommending it to my friends."

badly out of order. I was treated by

could live but a short while. I then
commenced using Royal Germetuer.
In three weeks I could cat anything,
