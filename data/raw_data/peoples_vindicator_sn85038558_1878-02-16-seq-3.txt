The patent of insomnia or wak iilness

stomach. Good digestion gives, sound
sleep, nudigestion interferes wititl: i The
brain and stomach sympathize. One of
the pronminent symrptoms a weak state of
tiregastrio organs is a disturbance of the
great nerve entrepot, the brain. Invigo
rate the stomach, and you restore erqurli
briumn to the great centre. A most relia

narcotics which, though they may fo: a

the operations of that all important or

Consumption Cured.-An old ph si

placed in hit hands by an East India
missionary the formnula of a simple vege
table remedy, for the speedy and perma
nent cure of consumrptiorn, bronchitis,
catarrh, asthma, and all throat and lung
nafections, also a positive and radical
cure fer nervous debility and all nervous
complaints, after having tested its won
derful curative powers in thousands of
cases, has felt it his duty to make it
known to !his suffering follows. Actua
ted by this motive, and a desire to re
lieve human suffering, I will send, free
of charge, to all who desire it, this re
cipe in German, French, or Euglish.

Aldige of Orleans says the New Or
leans Democrat represents a "faction
of the Democratic party." Certainly
it does, but unfortunately for Aldige
it's a "faction" of about 99 per cent of
the whole, to which, we are sorry to
say; Aldige does not belong-sorry for
Aldige, not the party. If Aldige will
read .ome. f the "long editorials,"
which he desires to say he has not, it
may supply that want in his physical
anatomy, perictty apparent from his
speech-brains.
It is apparent that the Committee on
"Constitutional Amendments" are
ashamed of their own creation. They
have given birth to it and none seem
anxious to claim iarentae. 'It is
well; for, for stupidity and rank noth
inguess we never saw the equal of
these Amend ments.
The "Amendmnents'" ark evidently
a compromise between the "nigger"
the legislature and Charley Howard's
Lottery. A sort of tri-angular agree
ment 1s it were.
The Democratic Seuatennt House
of Representatives, at least every
memlber there who voted for the
arendmtendn rndt orlsed mixied schools !
They cannot escape thie recutod. Ar
ticle 135 specially requires mixed
schools "and prohibits any other to be
established. These worthy gentle
men uitterly refused to abrogate it at
thie demand of thie eople. They,
thlereforle, stand fully committed to
one of the most outrageous, damnable
heresies of radicahIsm -an insult to
God and civilization.
