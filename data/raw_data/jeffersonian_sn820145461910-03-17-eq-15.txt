SAY OF OTHER EDITORS DEAFNESS CURED
A headline in an exchange says
that Uncle Sam is preparing to crush
the sugar trusts. Yes, we see an
awful burying ground looming up
where Uncle Sammy is interring the
remains of the trusts he has “crush
ed.” —The Moultrie (Ga.) Journal.
President Chas. S. Barrett, of the
National Farmers’ Union, says he
has no political aspirations and
wants no office. Mr. Barrett can be
of vast good to the farmers of the
whole country in his present capacity
and should be kept there. —The
Moultrie (Ga.) Journal.
In a few years more those people
called “insurgents” by thp corpora
tion Republicans, will join the honest
Democrats for good and honest gov
ernment, and the corporation Demo
crats will go over to the corporation
Republicans. Then there will be a
line between Democracy and pluto
cracy for the running of the govern
ment.—The Rolla (Missouri) Sharp
Shooter.

Too Much Power—The Remedy.
With J. Pierpont Morgan control
ling wealth to the amount of $12,-
000.000,000, or one-ninth of the
wealth of the United States, it seems
to this paper that President Smith, in
his address before the Brotherhood
meeting last week, had much reason
for saying that the wealth of the land
is unfairly distributed. This sum is
too vast for any finite mind to grasp.
John J. Ingalls once said that no man
could give an equivalent for one mil
lion dollars, and figures, based on the
idea that in the sweat of his brow
man must eat bread, have been time
and again submitted to show the
truth of this statement, and yet here
is Morgan with not one million, but
twelve thousand times one million,
and the fact does not elicit as much
comment now as the news of one
man worth one million did twenty
years ago. Think of it—a man, to
earn one million dollars, must work
every working day for 639 years,
drawing a salary of $5 a day. Mul
tiply 639 by 12,000, and you get
what? That Morgan controls the
earnings of nearly eight million
working men toiling an entire year at
$5 a day.
The Morgan properties consist of
railways, manufactories, insurance
and banking, and so great is his
power in finance, that it has been said
that he is a menace—not to the Uni
ted States alone, but to the entire
world!
Too much power for one man—
many thousand times too much!
The remedy will sooner or later
be applied, and when it is, individual
“captains of industry” will become
very scarce. The people will apply
the remedy, which will be the taking
over of all public utilities to be own
ed by the whole nation.—Better
Way, Minneapolis, Kan.
There is nothing sadder than to
see a great mind prostitued in a base
purpose.
John Temple Graves who was of
the South, Southern, with an inherit
ance of Democracy and honest gov
ernment, reared on the hills of hon
est old Georgia, is going around
boosting that most infamous meas
ure, the Ship Subsidy. One uncon
sciously imbibes the ideas of one’s
associates, but a strong intellect will
repel a theory that is based upon in
justice, even though that theory be
held by those one esteems. Stripped
of its frills and flounces, the Ship
Subsidy is a scheme to make poor
men pay for rich men’s ships; to
take the pennies of the poor to swell
the fortunes of the few; to subtract
some comfort from every home in
order that those who already have
too much may have more. It pro
poses to use the Government, our
Government, as the instrumen of this
infamy. Oh! for shame, Mr. Graves!
“Verily I swear ’tis better to be lowly
born,
And range with humble livers in con

Than to be perk’d up in glistering

And wear a golden”—subserviency.

In the Ballinger investigation
there is great admiration over Mr.

So a Cornell professor has demon
strated that by feeding certain kinds
of dyes to the hens the color of their
feathers may be changed as well as
the hue of the interior of their eggs.
What of it? This is not making two
blades of grass where there was one
before. What the human race cries
for is more eggs a§ Nature made
them, and at a less price, and not
freak yolks and feathers. —‘West Ba
den (Ind.) Journal.
A long list of the Bpef Trust offi
cials has been indicted by a New Jer

the price of meats. And they are
probably no better than many others
who wear stripes.—The Dalton

The Republican leaders and the
Democratic leaders in tbe New York
Legislature join hands to defeat the
measures advocated by Governor
Hughes in the interest of the public.
And it is that way in a great many

for the men you think are square
and the measures you think are
right.—Jewell Republic.
Henry Watterson, the bright ge
nius of the Louisville Courier-Jour
nal, says that Albert Sidney Johnson,
the most resplendent of modern cava
liers—from trig to toe a type of the
species—the very rose and expect
ancy of the young Confederacy—did
not have a drop of Southern blood in
his veins. He was a Yankee on both
sides of the house, though born in
Kentucky a little while after his
father and mother arrived there from
Connecticut. And Abraham Lincoln
did not have a drop of Northern
blood in his veins. He was South
ern born, and so were his ancestors
back of him for generations.—The
Tarpon Springs (Florida) Leader.
DOING GOOD WORK.
Kuhn’s Rheumatic Remedy, the
advertisement of which, “Drive Out
Rheumatism,” appears in this issue,
is doing very good work in curing
Rheumatism, judging by the letters
in the advertisement from cured
former sufferers. This remedy was
first offered in 1893, seventeen years
ago, and has gained a splendid repu
tation among the readers of The Jef
fersonian, many of whom have used
it. This company has been advertis
ing for a long time, and many thou
sands of rheumatic sufferers have
used and praise their remedy. These
people all got a free bottle through
the offer in the advertisement, which
you should do if you have Rheuma
tism. The company is doing a big
business, is reliable and will do just
what they say in their advertisement.
