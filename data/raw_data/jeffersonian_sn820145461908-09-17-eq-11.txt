Neuralgia
Pains
Are the result of an
abnormal condition of
the more prominent nerve
branches, caused by con
gestion, irritation, or dis
ease. If you want to re
lieve the pain try Dr. Miles
Anti-Pain Pills. They
often relieve when every
thing else fails. They
leave no disagreeable
after-effects. Just a
Eleasurable sense of re
ef. Try them.
“I have neuralgia headache right
over my eyes, and I am really afraid
that my eyes will burst. I also have
neuralgia pain around my heart. I
have been taking Dr. Miles’ Anti-
Pain Pills recently and find they re
lieve these troubles quickly. I seldom
find it necessary to take more than
two tablets for complete relief.”
MRS. KATHERINE BARTON
1117 Valley St, Carthage, Mo.
I have awful spells of neuralgia
and have doctored a great deal with
out getting much benefit. For the
last two years I have been taking
Dr. Miles’ Anti-Pain Pills and they
always relieve me. I have been so
bad with neuralgia that I sometimes
thought I would go crazy. Sometimes
it is necessary to take two of them,
but never more and they are sure to
relieve me.” MRS. ‘ FERRIER,

Why Not Form A Club?
Get some of your neighbors together, who
are not already subscribers to the Jeffer
sonian, and let them pitch in a quarter
apiece to pny for their political educa
tion for the next three months. Let them
read the Weekly Jeffersonian for that
time, and if they are not then able to take
part in the graduating exercises, we’ll quit
and call it square.
We need the quarters. Your neighbors
need the education. A quarter pays for
three months’ subscription to the Weekly
Jeffersonian.

Populistsl Help I
Many of our friends do not wish to ac

we need your help. Send us as many sub
scriptions as you can. Send us names of
parties who will solicit subscriptions for
us. Send us names of all those who are
interested in the cause. We need agents
and correspondents and friends and sym
pathizers all over the United States.
THE JEFFERSONIANS, THOMSON, GA-
CIRCULAR ISSUED BY BRYAN
ITE NEGROES.
(Continued from Page Seven.)
Negro. To vote foFMr. Taft in the
eomiftg election is to cast a vote in
favor of the elimination of the race
from politics and make possible the
disfranchisement of our people in the
North and West and to set the seal
of approval upon the outrage commit
ted upon our brave soldiers, and final
ly, to say to the world that we are in
capable of resenting ,an insult.
In six or eight Northern and West
ern states the Negroes have sufficient
power—if they vote as a unit —to de
feat the Republican party next No
vember and in this way convince the
leaders that our race will not support
the party unless it treats us with fair
ness and insures to us th-3
enjoyment of all rights and
privileges guaranteed under the
Constitution. Every race except
ours has used its votes to improve its
condition. We have until the pres
ent blindly supported the Republican
party, notwithstanding the fact that
it has deserted us at every point.
THE NATIONAL NEGRO AMER
ICAN POLITICOL LEAGUE was or
ganized to help our race make effect
ive its protest against the outrages
heaped upon it by the Republican
party. And after a careful consid
eration we have come to the conclu
sion that the time has come when the
race ought to be independent in poli
tics and vote for no party that will
not pledge to treat it with justice.
The League has been in communica
tion for weeks with Mr. Bryan and
the leaders of his party and they have
assured us that they desire the sup
port of our people and if any number
of them vote for Mr. Bryan and he is
successful they will treat the Negro
with fairness and give him the prop
er recognition in the matter of ap
pointment to Federal positions and do
whatever else they can to see that he
is given all the rights guaranteed un
der the Constitution. These things
being true, we are advising our peo
ple, in order to rebuke the Republi
can party and bring it back to its
original platform of principles, to
vote this year for Mr. Bryan; and to
those who do not care to vote for Mr.
Bryan, we say vote for any other
candidate for the presidency except
William H. Taft. In this advice, we
are heartily endorsed by thousands
of leading men in all walks of life
among us and by tens of thousands
of the “common people” of our race.
We must bring the issues of the cam
paign and the facts of this letter to
the attention of our people through
out America. In order to do this, we
must employ at least twenty-five good
campaign speakers, must hire clerks
and typewriters, must have money
for postage, printing, rent, etc.; and
we must get our side of the political
question in the newspapers, and this
will require at least ten thousand
dollars. Will you not be one of the
ten thousand manly and race-loving
Negroes to give us one dollar for this
purpose? When you send your dol
lar, please send us the names and ad
dresses of five or ten members of the
race whom you know to be loyal and
independent that we may send them a
be Jeffersonian
copy of this letter. We will not make
public your contribution or use your
name in "Writing to the parties whose
names you send us without your per
mission.
The future of our people, political
ly and every other way, is in your own
hands. We must act now and act as
a unit or we shall soon be serfs and
slaves in the land of our birth. Please
give this letter your immediate atten
tion and send us a dollar at once to
help in the work we are doing for you
and our people throughout America.
Yours for the manhood and political
rights of the race.
J. MILTON WALDRON,
President The National Negro Amer
ican Political League.
WM. MONROE TROTTER.
Corresponding ‘Secretary.
(Signed)
The very distinguished Right Rev.
J. Milton Waldron is further quoted
as saying:
11 Every vote cast by a colored man
for William J. Bryan is one vote cast
for the manhood and political rights
of the negro race, and two votes
against William 11. Taft and the
Roosevelt policies. ’ •’
This was the keynote of a speech,
in which the speaker, continuing,
said:
“Every vote cast by a colored man
for the Socialist, the Independence
League, or Prohibition party is one
vote cast for the manhood and politi
cal rights of the race and a half vote
cast against William H. Taft and the
Roosevelt policies.”
The speaker said that within a short
time the league would have in the field
100 speakers to address negroes
throughout the country, and that liter
ature, to the amount of a ton a day
would be sent out.
“The colored people in this country
are at a crisis in their history. They
are disfranchised in twelve states in
the union. The party that saved the
union and liberated the slaves has
practically abandoned its black allies,
and its leaders have given public ap
proval to the disfranchisement of the
race by southern states, and have ex
pressed a determination to eliminate
the black man from politics.
“For forty years the colored man
has voted solidly for one and the same
party, and by so doing he has won the
contempt of that party and the hatred
of the second strongest political par
ty in the country; and having been de
serted by the Republicans, he cannot
reasonably expect the Democrats to
receive him with open arms until a
large majority of the race at least let
it be understood that they will not al
ways vote the Republican ticket.
“We advise our people to be inde
pendent in politics, and to cast their
votes where they will count the most
in defeating the party which has prov
en to be a false friend. ’ ’
A QUESTION.
Mrs. Astoria —Yes, my daughter is
summering at Newport, and she’s
going to winter at Bermuda.
Mrs. St. Regis—How interesting!
Now if she should decide to spring in
Florida, I wonder where she’d fall? —
