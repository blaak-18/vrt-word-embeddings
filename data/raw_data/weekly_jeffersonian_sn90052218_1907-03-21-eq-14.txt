THE WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
A RIDDLE ANSWERED.
(The Springfield Republican.)
The “time honored principles” of
the Democratic party—what are they?
A fresh hint comes from the venera
ble Senator Morgan, of Alabama, who
says they are embodied in the first ten
amendments to the constitution of the
United States.
The Bailey Political Machine.
(From the Ft. Worth Telegram.)
The exoneration of Senator Bailey at
the hands of a majority of the Texas
legislature during the past few days
did not surprise the people of Texas
who have closely watched the official
proceedings since they were first insti
tuted. When the state legislature de
cided to elect Baily and then investi
gate him the masses of the people
knew just exactly what to expect and
have not been disappointed.
If Capt. Hobson keeps on talking
from now until he takes his seat in
congress, his wordery will be some
what depleted by the time Speaker
Cannon condescends to let him break
into the Congressional Record. —

The Investigation of the financial
operations of the Harriman group
through the Union Pacific railroad is
now under way. The Investigation
has not been gone into deep enough
so far to bring out very much. Harri
man has been before the interstate
commerce commission and testified
that the supreme court forced the
Great Northern railroad upon the
Union Pacific when he did not want
it; that former President Fish, of
the Illinois Central railroad, lost his
position because he used the railroad
funds to deposit with the Trust Com
pany of America so that the trust
company might pad its statements.
