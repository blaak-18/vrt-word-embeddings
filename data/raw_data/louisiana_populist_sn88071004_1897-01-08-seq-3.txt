Mr. J. F. Bolton and son, J. M.
Bolton paid us a pleasant call
Monday.
The Police Jury held their reg
ular January session this week
with all the members present.
The Parish School Board was in
session Monday.
We want to close out everything
we can before we take inventory
which will be Feb. 1st. Now
don't fail to call and see us, we
MEAN that when you come HERR
to buy goods that WE WILL SELL
You, as we want room for spring
stock. None of this old song and
dance advertisements, but simply
business and straight dealing.
WnILxAMs, WEAVER & O'QuIN.
The efficient member from Ward
10, Mr. W. II. Russell, was in
attendance upon the Police Jury
this week and paid us a pleasant l
call.
We have in transit one Car-Corn,
One Car oats and one Car Timothy
Hay boughbt for cash. Prices to
1 ad the town,
WILLUAMS' WEAVER & O'QUIN.
Now let each Police Juror and
the two committemen he may select,
while canvassing the ward for
destitute where the donations must
go, also collect the money from
those deserving help yet who are
able to partially help themselves,
and list their names tnd amounts
rieady for the provisions that will
Sbe put on sale at cost at the same
time the donations are distributed.
In. the recent move we left our
chicken a till the last, and the Police
Jnry being in session, the member
from ward 5, Bro. 8, D. Orump,
kindly volunteered to assist us be
cause of his experience in foraging
as a soldier in the war. So on
Monday night about 10:30 we made
the haul, and Bro. Crump outdid
his war record-never lost a fowl
reall~, we didn't know we had so
many chickens, We are no longer
surprised that the good people of
ward 5 send Bro. Crump away
from hom~e to attend to all their
important business.
Some member of the City Coun
cil will earn the gratitute of all up
town residents by having a street
lamp placed on the corner near the
Lichtenstein building. If you don't
think it necessary, go up town af
ter dark.
Quite unexpectedly a 32-calabre
cartidge exploded ii the fire place
of Mr.' Heniry Anders, just as his
.i daughter was fixing the fire. The
young lady was wounded in the
~cheek. Fortunately the hurt is
:t: slight, ad she will in a few days
be none the worse for the accident.
SIt:ksmAith regret that we chroni
cle the death of Master Ernest
:Prudhonuxie, the young man who
: was accidently shot by his cousin
::.-at; Mr. Timon',s. After suffering
o'! $me days he died &aturday, and
wa buried Sunday in the Cemete
ti . . Campte, La: :We extend
's~hu --ya:ilpathy to the family.
Natchitoches, La.
Denr sir:- * *
Tiunmes re so tirht out here that
every do(,llar I can rai:e !ocs to
keep the wolf from nmy own and
neigh!,'or's door. Tllhe situation
here is getting critical-numbers
of our very hest citizens are en
tirely out of anything to live on.
I have let all my corn go for bread
and let my stock do without and
am now running my face for all it
is worth to get more (and that.
don't go very far), and'unless there
is some measures of relief extend
ed to those people they will be in
the midst of a famine soon. As
matters stand to-day there is ev
ery plrobal)ility that t.wxo-thirds of
our people will have to leave their
homes in search of br'ead, and no
one seems to know where to go in
search of it. Many of them have
remained at home hoping to be
able to get some assistance from
the donation from the state, but
all that comes is on the rail road
and people living a long dititance
find when they get there it has all
been taken by those living nearer
by and they return without any
thing. * *
With best wishes for the Poru
LIsT and its editor I am respect
fully,
The above from a prominent citi
zen in ward 2 (not a Populist eith
er) shows whut we have contended
all along to be true, while our
neighbor, the Enterprise has ig
nored this condition of affairs but
has apparently endeavored to hide
it and in some instances disputed
it. Others have joined the Enter
prise in this course through a feel
ing of f4lse pride-the same kind
that indbces the 2-bit aristocrat to
build tljo front of his house of
marble while the back is built of
barrel staves. Our Police Jury
have acted nobly and generously
in the matter and some others have
done even better, and we are glad
to inform the gentleman who writes
the above that relief is on the way,
coming sure and soon.
The Cltlzcns Ticket.
The new Registration law goes
into effect to-day. This law, like
the new election law, gives the par
ty controlling the machinery, ab
solute power, By manipulation
of this registration law, the igno
rant can be disfranchised in some
places and registered in others,
just to suit the whims of the pow
ers that be. Under the election
law, it was shown that the most
ignorant negroes were voted whole
sale wherever the ring desired it,
while white men were disfranchis
ed wherever the ring could, not
control their votes. In fact, the
new election law and the new reg
istration law are the most tyran
nical and oppressive and partisan
measures ever enacted and give to
the party in power despotic sway
which will be used for self-per
petuation.
It is now said that there will be
an attempt to secure an honest
election for the delegates to the
Constitutional Convention. A
combination for that purpose will
be easily formed.
There is no kind of doubt that a
large majority of the people favor
honest elections and will join in' a
noni-partisan movemement to con
trol the convention. A citizens'
ticket headed by such men as
Charles Janvier, J. Henry Shep
herd, Henry McCall, A. T. Nel
son, J. T..Howell and others who
possess the confidence of every
worthy class of Louisianans would
make a powerful fight and be over
whelmingly elected in a fair con
test.
But there will be no fair con
test. The men who control the
imachinery and the negroes will
use them to carry the election for
delegates. They will have abso
lute control of the convention and
will exact just such an organic law
as suits them. This is certain. It
is self-evident in the light of the
past.
Still we are in favor of fighting
:wrong to the bitter'end. It is bet
Iwan t#ollow truth and justice to
rI]der' to the 11 owe's 0I ( al'nlE':Ss.

We are pleased to note that the

are being cleaned.
We are pained to learn of the
(leath at Camrpti, La., of Mr. J.
P. Ricalheimer, one of our sister
city's most progressive citizons.
Dcceased was well and favorably
known here, and few men onjoyed
the confidence and respect of the
entire community as he did.
We symlpathise with his relatives
in their bereavement.

the time. Don't discontinue your
advertising without discontinueing
your business.
Those who contend that adver

well to notice that advertisers al
ways have the luck on their side.
The Drouth Sufferers.
.Mr. W. A. O'Niell, of St. Mary
parish, writes us inclosing a letter
received from Mr. A. W. Pollock,
Grant parish, both of which letters
we publish elsewhere. Mr. Stew
art, who was elected at a mass
meeting of the people of Grant
parish to solicit aid for the drouth
sufferers, tells of their condition
and their needs, and calls atten
tion to the relief which should be
granted them it it is desired to
prevent great suffering in that
section.
The State has come to their re
lief in the matter of corn, and is
supplying all that may be needed,
either free or at a nominal cost;
but, as he remarks. this is not
enough: The people cannot live
on corn alone, and cannot clothe
themselves with it. The complete
failure of the crops, preventing
them from making or saving any
money, left them without the means
of providing clothing for their fam
ilies.
It has been the desire of the
drouth sufferers of North Lotusiaria
not to advertise their misfortune to
the world, or to indiscriminately
apply for aid and assistance, They
have, with a proper spirit, prefer
red to confine their applications to
Louisiana. The State has come to
their relief with corn, and they
now ask the people of South Lou
isiana, who escaped the misfortune
of a crop fiail'ure, to co-operate in
granting them relief, giving such
things as the State cannot.
Mr. W. A, O'Niell, of St. Mary,
to whom Mr. 8tewart first applied,
receives the project favorably, and
believes that the people of South
Louisiana will respond to the re
quest for aid. It is true, he re
marks that they themselves made
little profit on their last crop in
consequence of the low prices pre
vailing for agricultural products;
at the same time, they were suc
cessful in raising, a comparatively
bounteous harvest. He is certain,
therefore, that the sugar planters,
of whom he is one, will be glad to
subpcribe something for the relief
of their distressed fellow-agricultu
rits, and he suggests that some of
the leading planters call a meeting
of those engaged in sugar culture
and manufacture, and all those
who feel inclined to aid a good
cause, to take steps to raise a fund
to relieve such wants of the drouth
sufferers as cannot be well relieved
by the agents of the State govern
ment. Mr. O'Niell's idea is an ex
cellent one, which we warmly ap
prove;i but it is a matter where-
if any action is to be taken-it
should be taken at once.-Timnes
Democrat.
