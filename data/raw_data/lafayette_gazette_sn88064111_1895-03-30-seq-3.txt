A Favorite Amnusement. p
There are some people in this z
town-who seem to take special de- t
light in tearing down funeral no- tr
tices. It may be strange, but is an
nevertheless true that funeral no- h
tices ate torn off the posts to tl
which they are tacked, in a most al
reckless manner. This is wonton n
vandalism and people should wait b
until after the funeral to indulge in a
what seems to be a favorite amuse- b
- nent.
A Narrow Escape. tl
A marvelous escape from a most a
horrible death is repoted near the
depot last. W-ednesday- afternoon
)ust when the east-bound passenger
r train pulled in. A hobo who was
d stealing a ride on the blind baggage
attempted to jump off and fell under
the wheels of the train which for
tunately had already put on
the air brakes. Witnesses to the
occurrence state that the man was
dr-agged under a car several feet and
6 it is incomprehensible to them how
he was not criished by the wheels.
tr The man wag slightly bruised on
n the hands and face. He was sub
sequently interviewed by the town
marshal who upon being told that
he was looking for a restaurant,
furnished him with a suite of rooms
in Billaud's Municipal Bastille
r where he was provided with the
e regulation menu.
Let It be Done at Once.
' Should the decision of the Su
preme Court in the suit of the par
ish vs. Numa Schayot render null
and void the annexation of the ad
ditions made in 1884, it is to be
earnestly hoped that there will soon
0 be found some law to re-annex the
same territory. jo time should be
lost if such a thing is possible.
e This matter should be settled at
- once, and settled right. It will not
do to let matters remain in the
present state of uncertainty. If
there is one privilege an American
citizen will insist upon having, it is
that of being able to say where he is
living. As it stands now some of
our citizens are so bewildered that
they will not venture to assert with
any dgeree of positiveness that they
are living on the Louisiana side of
the Texas line. Let some remedial
step be taken as soon as practic
able.
A Genial Judge.
The many friends in Lafayette of
Judge Blackman were happy to

A Fatal Accident.
Another friendless stranger was
crushed to death by a train Tues- r
day last. I-His name is James Gen
try and he hails firom Catahoula
parish in the northern part of the
State. Hie fell untlder the wheels in j
the attenmpt to jump on a freight a
train to steal a ride. Henry Church
and other kind gentlemen carried
him tothe baggage room and procured
the services of Dr. Tolson who did h
all he could to relieve the unfortu- t
nate man and save his life if possi
ble. As it was some time since the
accident had happened the flow of
blood had weakened hiris very much
and it was evident to the doctorc
that the chances for recovery were
against him. The doctor dressed
is wound .and bandaged his leg
n -which bad been terribly mangled.
He was sent on the afternoon train
to the Charity Hospital at New Or
s leans, but died a few minutes after
e reaching that place.

I are charged with breaking in the store of P.
' Demanade & Co., last Saturday, and steal
ing several hams, a few sacks of flour. a box
of cigars dad Other articles. It seems these
three negroes Af~e implicated in this burglary
- but it appears the star of the banid is the ne
1 gro, Bob. Rogers who has fled to parts un
t known. King, who is mentioned above, is
not exactly a mdiiister but The Gazette is
informed that he is ministerially inclined and
at times he is entrusted with the
spiritual welfare of the colored popu
lation of Breaux Bridge. He lives in
Lafayette but pays regular visits to his flo-k
on the Treche whenever their morals need
looking after. His downfall will be learnt
- with sorrow by his congregation in Breaux
Bridge who will no doubt pray for his re
demption.

An Elegant Stock.
We are rea.lly in earnest when we say that
L.eon Plonsky has one of the finest and
most complete assortments of spring goods
ever brought to Lafayette. His large store
is full to repletion with an elegant stock of
gentliemen's, ladies' and children's dress
goodls. Ills suits are of the best and his
prices are incredibly low. Leon never fails
to procure for his customers the latest de
signs and styles in clothing as in everything
else and this year has been no exception to
this long-established rule in his store. The
only way one way have idea of Mr. Plons
ky's large and varied stock is by visiting his
store.

A regular meeting of the School
Board is called for Saturday, the

Let 'er Conle.
The building of the Steele rail
road from this point to Arknansas
City, Arkansas, together with the
line projected from here to Ham
mond which will in time probably
be extended East as far as Mobile,
and West to Lafayette, will make
quite a railroad center of Baton
R:ouge, andl will e:'ct:tuaily result in
a bridge across the river at this
point. l :ton lRoufge is; destined to
become a grent city in the coursemf
of ti:ne and every citizen can hasten
forwart this time by pttmting his
shoiulter to the wheel andl doing
what iie can in ai'I of any encter
prise lprjcctel f::r the good of the a
city. Itarge resitts andl substantial 1
liprosperity cannot be achieved in a '
single day. Cities are built up by
contit:tt'ei effort and inteiligent co- -
operittion on the part tof the people, v

It is otly a question of time when
this town will be connected by rail I
with the Capitol city. Should the
projected line mentioned above fail t
to materialize, one of the systems t
running along the Mississippi river t
will, we trust, take advantage I
of this splendid opportunity offered i
them to build a road that must of r
necessity be a paying one. The
great need of this country is compe- r
tition in the railroad business and
everybody should work toward that f
end.
Sen. all-Pox. t
lMayor Burke of New Iberia, has t
issued the following proclamation l
to wvhich the at:ention of our people a
is called. 'rhough there need be r
no fear at present, the necessary
precautions should be taken:
Noticitfig fiom the public press,
that small-pox is prevailing in many i
parts of the couintry, and is daily
spreading to the four parts of the
compass, and with the rapid com
munications of the times it may en
ter our own little city, like a thief in
the night; unannounced; It there
fore becomes the duty of our peo- I
ple to take all the precautions ne- t
cessary to ward off the virulence of s
the enemy, if he were to make his
loathsome appearance in our midst.
In view of which I call upon the
parents of all the children attending
the public schools, to have their 1
children vaccinated as early as pos- a
sible, and invite all parents of the
city to do likewise, and take no
risk of disfiguration.

H iappenings in the Busy and

for the Columns of The
Gazette.
Farmers in general have taken advan
tage of the unustlally fine weather, and in
conseqcuence the majority of them have
r sown corn. Gardens are not looking quite
as barren as a few days ago. A few vegeta
bles now adorn the squares.
It is our most painful duty to report Mrs.
N. D. Young's death last Tuesday
at 4 p. m. at the age 41 years. This ,ood
e. Christian, devoted parent and womanly wo
man was ready indeed when the last call
iwas made and she was gathered to join the
is ranks of the unknown in the great valley
d of shadow. She died smiling, awaiting
ascent to her heavenly throne, where a
crown will adorn her head, as a just reward
for her many virtues. To the bereaved
husband and children our sympathies are
l extended.

\\ell, winter is slowly leaving us ,
after a long,' unwelcome stay, and P
with it are gone many poor cattle p
and horses. Farmers do not pro- u
Svide a sufficiency of hay and other n
food for their stock in the winter. h
We are busy planting corn and b
plowing the land to plant rice. h
There will be a large reduction in is
the cotton acreage in this part of
the parish notwithstanding the fact It
that the city buyers have raised the
price as they unusually do at plant- f
ing time. If they did not do that P
many would not plant cotton at all. g
It is a beautiful sight to see the i
pear trees in bloom in my orchard. a
There will be a large crop of this w
fruit this year, if there is no storm. b
Mr. .Alexander Hoffpauir's fam
ily, consisting of six or seven, have
the measles. Ursin Hoffpauir's
baby died of this disease, but this
is the only death reported though
many families have been afflicted
with it.
Plenty of new land is being
plowed, there being a large increase "
in acreage of corn and rice this si
year.
Mr. Editor, Lafayette is the li
banner parish for bad roads and dogs.
There should be some way to re- i
pair our roads or traveling will have j
to be stopped, and some effort
should be made to improve the ii
breed of our dogs. Of course we :
must have them, as they are the
only aniials allowed to roam atb
lange. Even the poorest man can c
afford to own seven or eight dogs, il
when he is unable to have any hogs
as the latter are not permitted to
run at large. st
Our public school taught by
Robert Cunningham is woiking v
finely. He is a competent teacher. ,
The price of eggs here last week
was down to 5 cents a dozen; even at u
that price there was no demand for s
them.
The sevcire winter has raised the
price of corn to one dollar. If.our'
farmers would plant sorghum-cane
for hogs, it would save them much
corn during the hot summers.
This plant produces well on any
kind of soil and dry weather does
not retard its growth. Farmers,
try it. Plant it near your hog pas
tures, and if cut green, hogs will
eat leaves, seed, stalk and all.
Now is the time to transplant
peach and china trees as they grow
best after budding. OBERON.
If you want to carry the correct
time, have T. M. Biossat to repair
your watch.

Free Speech.
Chicago Inter-Ocean.
There have been recently two illi
beral manifestations of religious
partisanship. The one was in New
Jersey, where certain protestants,
more zealous than wise, sought to
inhibit Robert Ingersoll from de
lievirg one of his lectures. The
other was in Georgia, where a mob
of Catholics sought to prevent a
person named Slattery, who is in
search of notoriety and dollars,
from delivering a lecture. Inger
soll's lecture was against all ani
singular forms of religious belief.
Slattery's was against the Catholic
form of religion. The Savannah
demonstration was by far more de
plorable than in New Jersey, be
cause it was lawless. It was sup
pressed by an armed force. All such
demonstrations must be stopped.
The right to free speech is essential.
Mr. Slattery is not a very learned
man, he may not be a very estima
ble man, but learned or ignorant,
reputable or disreputable, he has
legal right to criticise any or all
forms of political or religious be
lief.
Then and Now.
'There was a time twhen he who would
keep informed of the progress of knowledge,
the record of discovery and invention, and
the currents of human thought, could and
indeed must rely chiefly if not wholly upon
books. That day has passed. Books we
must still read, as the crystallization and
permanent embodiment of human thought
and knowledge. But to-day it is the news
paper, the magazine, the periodical review,
upon which we must chiefly depend if we
would follow closely the intellectual move
ment of the day. And now a new difficulty
has arisen. This newspaper and periodical
literature has beeome so multitudinous and
bulky as to be a heavy burden to the busy
man or woman, while even the person who
has leisure and inclination to read widely
is often unable to get access to the current
publications. Especially in the smaller -
cities, villages, and rural districts is the
lack of such opportunity felt. It is felt by -
the clergyman, the teacher, the lawyer, the
physician, the merchant, the artisan, the
farmer and the cultured and thoughtful
practical literary question is: With all
these and many other classes of persons the
great practical literary question is: How
cami I best supplement my indispensible
home paper? It was to answer this ques
and meet this demand that PUBLIC OPIN
ION (now published in New York City)
was founded nine years ago. It selects the
best, condenses it to the last degree, and
serves it in convenient and attractive form.
