ZETTERJ TEJTM THE PEOPLE
THE CATHOLIC ARTICLE.
Chicago, HL, Dec. 29, 1908.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Atlanta, Ga.
My Dear Mr. Watson Let me know
whether you have had your editorial,
printed in June, entitled “The Catho
lic Hierarchy and Politics,” printed
in pamphlet form or not; if not, please
have it done at once or instruct us
to have it done in our print shop, be
cause this article should be circulated.
Now is the time to commence all
kinds of work towards concentrating
the socialist, radical, free press, free
speech and liberty-loving votes all un
der one banner for 1912. This matter
should be seriously canvassed and
thought out now. The plan should
comprise numerous auxiliary move
ments apparently working independ
ently of each other.
Trusting to hear from you soon, and
with best wishes for you for the New
Year, Yours truly,
PARKER 11. SERCOMBE.
Answer: The article referred to
constitutes one of the chapters of
Watson’s ‘ ‘ Handbook. ’ ’
LIKE A CHAT WITH A FRIEND.
January 8, 1909.
Dear Mr. Watson:
On the theory that a man may be
complimented while living I write you.
I want to assure you that I enjoy
every number of your paper and mag
azine. Also I want to assure you that
the small vote you received does not
express the esteem in which you are
held. Many of our people recognize
that you did more while in Congress
that many of the crowing cocks who
have been there for twelve to fifteen
years.
It would make you rejoice if you
could know how the young men look
to you for information on the leading
issues. I have a full set of your maga
zines and many of your speeches. The
college boys often come to me to get
up-to-date information from your
publications. The prejudice with this
generation is very strong against you
because you brushed the hair the
the wrong way on the “Dear” Demo
cratic party and also because you have
not joined the acclaim for W. J. B.
This will pass as the years go and you
will have the confidence of the com
ing generation. There has been enough
abuse heaped upon you to break your
heart but the plaudits of the people
will make it glad some day.
You sometimes pay your respects to
C. W. Macune. He is now a Metho
dist preacher. He belongs to the
Northwest Texas Conference and is
stationed at Thurber, Texas. That is
in this county. I had a talk with
him last year. He remembers his
friends of 89 to 92.
I wish you would travel out this
way and let your friends have a
chance to grasp your hand. That is
the way W. J. B. does. But I be
lieve you refuse to follow an illus
trious example. He has purchased a
home in Texas. As you have land in.
Virginia, Georgia and Florida you
must “come across” and buy a home
in Texas.
What has become of Gordon Nye? I
fear you took him to your Florida
home and an alligator ate him.
What is the best biography of
Robert E. Lee and also of Benjamin
Franklin published ? That is, in one or
two volumes and at a reasonable
price?
Yours very truly,
SUBSCRIBER.
Ed. Comments:
Since Dr. McCune has entered the
ministry, we trust that his talent is
at length well invested, and that he is
doing good work.
Gordon Nye is in New York City,
among the heathen.
John Esten Cooke’s Life of Lee is a
most readable and valuable work.
Dr. J. William Jones’ Reminiscen
ces of Lee was “authorized” by the
Lee family and by the Faculty of
the Washington and Lee University.
Then, there is the “Life” by Fitz
hugh Lee, and another by Dr. All
friend, and the book on same subject
by Robert E. Lee, Jr., the son of our
great soldier.
Upon the whole, we incline to think
that John Esten Cooke may have
drawn the most life-like picture of
Lee, and given the most stirring and
satisfactory account of his work. Cook
was a staff officer, first under Gen.
Stonewall Jackson and then under
Gen. J. E. B. Stuart. This being so,
he came in contact with Lee early in
the Civil War and was with him to the
last. He saw the superb soldier in
all the varying phases of the strug
gle, was a party of the vast tragedy
in which Lee was the commanding
figure, and his book is indispensable
to anyone who wants to become ac
quainted "with the real Lee.
Sydney George Fisher’s Life of
Franklin is perhaps the best, but you
must read Benjamin’s Autobiography,
also.

“There is more information in your
two Jeffersonians for a young man
than all other periodicals published.
Find check enclosed for subscription
to March 1910. Also send me “Water

Edward W. Walker, Jr., Westfield,
N. Y.
“Enclosed find postal money order
for which please send me “Bethany”
and renew my subscription to Jeffer
sonian Magazine.”
December 21, 1908.
M. A. Kerley, Austell, Ga.
“If you accept as small amounts
as one dollar, please send me your
“Sketches of Roman History,” and
place remainedr on campaign ex
penses. If Santa Claus should fail to
bring answer in the words to the Jeff
ersonian’s prayer, be assured the an
swer is felt sincerely in the hearts of
thousands. Some of us could not read
to our grandchildren “An October
73be 'Jeffersonian
Day” without short pauses to steady
our voices. December number of the
Magazine could not be given its merits
by me; I have no words sufficient to
give it the praise it deserves.”
December 2, 1908.
Dr. L. A. Neiman, Brooklyn, N. Y.
“Herewith find my subscription to
the Jeffersonian, and “Sketches of
Roman History.” It has occurred to
me that in the earlier days of the
Magazine when there was conducted
an educational department it imparted
a fountain of knowledge to the numer
ous readers that can’t be conveyed
in the various articles contributed
monthly. I have also thought much
good would accrue if the worthy editor
■would, every month or two, publish
the names of some good books essen
tial to the study of economics and
fundamental Democracy. ’ ’
ED. NOTE: Educational depart
ment has been resumed. The book re
views seldom fail to give the names
of one or two good books on economic
subjects.

W. P. Holmes, Barnesville, Ga.
“I send post office order for $2.00
to renew my subscription to both Jeff
perous New Y T ear. ”
November 16, 1908.
Dr. J. W. Nichols, Deßidden, La.
“In my most candid and humble
opinion a conference should be called
at as early date as may be practic
able. The principles which all Jeffer
sonians espouse are right. This be
ing assured, let the watch word be
never surrender.”
December 8, 1908.
E. B. Harman, Dewey Rose, Ga.
“While we Populists may be in
our Valley Forge with darkness and
gloom surrounding us, if we will but
look up we will see the silver lining
and take courage. I enclose subscrip
tions for your Magazine and paper.
I do not claim commission or clubbing
rate as I think both are worth the
money.”
December 10, 1908.
J. H. Frost, Bryan’s Mill, Texas.
“Please send me your Jeffersonian
Magazine, the Weekly Jeffersonian
and Tri-Constitution as per clubbing
rate in Magazine. I have been a sub
scriber to your Magazine all the while.
The more I read Watson, the more I
want to read him.”
December 18, 1908.
J. S. Morris, Warthen, Ga.
“I was very sorry indeed you fail
ed to carry Georgia, but there were
many things caused us to feel proud of
the you made. Surely I am in
favor of keeping up the fight. I have
never retreated and never e?iP e ct to
surrender. I have been a Populist since
1876. Have two boys that are now,
and two more who will vote Populist
at' twenty-one. I enclose $1.50 for
‘Life and Speeches.’ This book
will be a Christmas present to my
family.”
December 13, 1908.
E. M. Eldridge, Worcester, Mass.
“ Enclosed find $2.00 for which send
to my address the two Jeffersonians.
I am glad that somewhere in the land
the true Democracy and honest legal
tender money is preached.”
December 16, 1908.
J. M. Ramsey, Texarkana, Ark.
“I received eleven copies of your
Magazine on the 14th and sold them
in two days. It would have made you
smile to see how quickly they went. I
will want at least twenty each month
for I mean to scatter them as widely
as I can. I enclose money order. I
am truly for you and the great
cause. ’ ’
December 15, 1908.
Mrs. W. A. Bowen, Norwood, Tenn.
“Enclosed find money order to re
new my and Mr. J. M. Day’s subscrip
tion to the Jeffersonians and for the
book ‘Bethany.’ I was somewhat
discouraged after the election, but on
reading your last Weekly was inspir
ed with new courage.”
December 19, 1908.
W. A. Watson, Commerce, Ga.
“Please find SI.OO enclosed for re
newal to the Jeffersonian. lam near
ing the eightieth mile post and never
saw the principles you advocate enac
ted into law, but the coming genera
tion surely will. Don’t give up in
despair; generations to come will rise
up and call you blessed.”
December 16, 1908.
M. R. Hopper, Griffithville, Ark.
“I get very low spirited at times
and almost give up the fight but when
I get the Jeffersonians and read your
editorials it puts new life in me and
I think sometimes I can see a little
light breaking at a distance.”
7 December 15, 1908.
Thad Hill, Cameron, Texas.
“I certainly enjoy reading the
Jeffersonians. I distribute mine and
solicit subscriptions. ’ ’
December 22, 1908.
W. J. 8., Aveland, Ga.
“I have decided that as I was old
and not able to stir around, I would
not try to take any part in politics
after the election, but would spend my
remaining days in reading the scrip
ture and try to get ready for another
world, but as I find the time for which
I have paid for the Jeffersonian and
Magazine nearly out, I am not satis
fied for them to quit coming to me.”
December 5, 1908.
J. W. Carnes, Jakin, Ga.
“I am an old man and have been
with the reform forces for the past
fifteen years. I feel thankful that the
good Lord has given us such a leader
as you are —a man too pure to be
bribed; too full of love for your fel
lowman to be influenced by the popu
lar current of money of rich men.
Pl* ase renew my subscriptions to the
two Jeffersonians.
“With best wishes for you and
yours and for your final triumph.”
