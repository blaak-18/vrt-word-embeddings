There has been on exhibition some days to
since "a petrified man" said to have been

violation of the law. We do not know that m'
the parties against whom these true bills were in
found are of those who had subscrll ed to the nm
agreement. It appears that a fight will be WI
made by the parties indicted, and that the m
saloon-keepers and others have combined Is
for the purpose of furnishing the sinews of

For the past week or two there have been the

Paul Cormier, one of the negroes thought do

that he was now safely held behind the de
bars. Under date of the I1th we received in
a letter from the chief deputy sheriff of St. of
Martin parish, inclosing the information that in
no capture had been made. Notwithstand- wi

On An Investigating Tour. er
In company with Messrs. E. G. Voorhies, in
J. Alf. Mouton and Frank G. Mouton, and hi
through the courtesy of the latter, the writer sb
enjoyed a very pleasant ride to the cele- th
brated farm where "gas oil" is alleged to wl
have been discovered. tal
The drive was over one of the lovliest,
-and far-famed for its natural scenery
sections of the parish. The eye gazed on a ne
magnificent pastoral ideal, and rested long- co
ingly upon as perfect a landscape as nature's
masterful touch could make it, and to the C(
writer proved as grateful as the sight of the co
land of Canaan to the weary pilgrims of ee
Israel. th
What an elysian! The myriads of hillocks; ac
the magnificent meadows; the shadowy ais- by
les; the sloping fields, at this time receiving pe
the husband-man's tillage; the serpentine tee
road; the pretty and numerous farm houses, no
dotted here and there on the peaks; the
cattle lazily grazing on the luxuriant her
bage, all focussed, tended to render the view lei
decidedly picturesque, if not truly majestic wl
in its grandeur. And the "'sacred fountains en
of feelings" glowed with rapturons delight tlt
in contemplating this wonderful splendor,
which far exceed the "'quirks of a blazoning
pen" to even faintly portray. th
Time sped quickly by and soon our des
tination was reached, and the proverbial
hospitality of the creole was examplified by
the courtesy shown in the opportunity af- be
forded to facilitate our inquiries and satisfy in
our curiosity in regard to the now famous wi
"*dirt what burns like gas." vol
Our investigation led first to applying a ac
lighted match to the dirt at the bot
tom of a hole recently made, and it ignited ha
with a flash, emitting an unsteady and some
what offensive light. Two fresh holes, fo ts
about 18 inches in depth, were dug by us, r
and on a lighted fuse being touched to each,
one ignited, the other did not.
It was noticed that the composition, from ere
the hole which proved non-combustible, is nea
a deep red clay, with much moisture, while br
the dirt from the other, was very inflam- bir
mable, is a black sandy and slightly gritty eat
substance, with small lumps of lime,showing, hi
evidently, decomposed moldl. The dis- Co
covery of this "'dirt that burns" was made Sui
in a singular manner. Upon the present spot ne
was a mound some four feet high and upon he
this was a pile of dry brush. Wishing to
utilize the land, fire was set to the brush; S
after it had burned, and to the srprise of a,
the family, the mound continued on fire, and a.
for eight days it was allowed to burn, until
the mound disappearc d, and still the fire
continued to burn into the earth around;
then, for some reason, it was extinguished. a
Without in the least claiming any know
ledge of its constituent parts, still our ob- t
servations would incline us to pronounce it thu
rlle a peat bed. If so, it has been demonstrated
Lev. to have but little commercial value. "To a
rere limited extent, it is used," says an authority,
,ev. "in virlous German factories, which happen
to be situated in the immediate neighbor
und hood of-extensive peat deposits."
the Returning from this- trip of investigation,
Ea on the.way,we stopped .a few moments at Ba
the bin's Chalybeate Springs, and took copionus
tad dranghts.of.this invigorating water, while, at
an- the same time, admiring the beautiful
ills environments.
ads The declining sun admonished us that we
trd must leave this realm made blissful by fan
sys cy's unbridled' capers, where we would fain
he abide longer. So, sorrowfully we drove
of homeward, and nature's beautiful handi
rill work had lost none of its charms-and the
reflection came most forcibly to mind that
this is truly the abode of happiness.
It was an instructive and most enjoyable
ride.

The shipment of chickens and eggs from
this point seem to be falling off as compared
with last year. This seems very strange,
for there is no locality where poultry can be
more profitably raised than here. The range ii

excelled. There are many families liviing in
the vicinity around Carencro, who defray s
- their household expenses by the sale of eggs s
raised on their farms; and this with very th
little labor and trouble. In a country such ct
