WHY CAW ON IF
There is but one kind of war that
is unlawful, and that is war for lib
erty and freedom. Our revolution
ary fathers, led by Washington, were
a band of traitors, while England’s
conquest of the Boers was lawful.
The French peasants who struck
for liberty, revolted against the old
Bourbon kings and overthrew them,
were rioters and traitors and law
breakers, while the Kaiser violated
no written law when he invaded
France in 1914.
There is no law against one nation
attacking another. Wars of con
quest are not unlawful. At the close
of the World War, the allied nations
in chorus demanded the Kaiser from
Holland that he might be tried. Hol
land answered in a 500-page brief,
showing the Kaiser had violated no
law. In making war on other na
tions he had only followed the prec
edent set by those nations. Holland
set forth instance after instance
where England, France and other na
tions had made war on other coun
tries and invaded their territory.
Holland cited many cases where the
allied nations that were clamoring
for the Kaiser had provided a haven
for princes and kings and refugees
who had lost battles. If custom
makes laws, the Kaiser was inno
cent, for he had followed custom.
So the Kaiser was not tried —and
he never will be tried. He had not
violated any international law, for
there is no such law against war.
True, he had violated his treaty with
Belgium, but that treaty, as all
others are, was an agreement without
a penalty. An agreement, or a
treaty, without a penalty, without a
court or some legal institution to de
code whether it has been broken, and
if so fix and enforce the penalty, is
exactly what von Bethman Hollwig
said it is—a mere scrap of paper.
Society’s war system is as old as
society, and is as legal as society’s
systems of religion.
The world ought to be put under
law. War should be outlawed. The
world has outlawed the traffic in
slaves, and women, and opium—why
not outlaw war, a more deadly enemy
to society?
The diplomats of the nations meet
occasionally and discuss methods that
is claimed will make war humane.
In our country efforts were made
for years to make the liquor traffic
and saloons decent. Saloons could
not run in basements or back rooms
or behind screens; liquor could not
be sold to minors; the doors must
close at certain hours; the place could
not run on Sundays, etc. But it was
learned that with every possible re
striction saloons could not be made
decent—so the saloon was outlawed.
Nor can war be made humane.
War carries with it the unpunished
violation of every known law—mur
ders, arson, appropriation of prop
erty, the starving and abuse of wo
men and children, etc. War suspends
civil, humane and representative gov
ernment. How can the system of
war be made humane when it affords
AS PRESIDENT WASHING
The call to enforce the prohibition
law recalls the story of the Whisky
Rebellion in Eastern Pennsylvania
during George Washington’s term in
the executive chair.
The upheaval was caused by a gov
ernment tax levied against distiller
ies. President Washington himself
took charge of the enforcement of
the law.
En route west to the scene of the
rebellion, President Washington was
met by the officials and citizenry of
Harrisburg, and their address of wel
come was, accompanied by resolutions
of loyalty to the law he was enforc
ing. The address, too long for re
production, teems with wrath at “un
provoked outrages committed by
these lawless men, who are in oppo
sition to one of the mildest and most
equal of governments of which the
condition of man is susceptible,” and

opportunity for the commission of
every sort of crime?
How silly it is for the nations to
make any sort of agreement about
the conduct of war —how men shall
be killed, and how they shall not be
killed; what deadly implements shall
be used, and what shall not be used.
Such agreements have always been
broken and always will be.
Unless the nations outlaw war, un
less they declare what acts consti
tute war, fix penalties, and arrange
for their enforcement; unless they
agree on a plan to restrain war-like
nations, like we restrain individuals
who threaten to violate the law—-un
less these things are done the next
war may mark the end of civilization.
The Lewis Gas
Here are some facts about the
Lewis gar: It has a spread 55 times
greater than any gas used in the
late war. The gas used in the World
War would easily spread three or
four blocks—one-fourth of a mile.
The Lewis gas will spread 55 times
that distance—from 10 to 14 miles.
The city of London proper i* but
11 miles square, and greater London
is 25 miles square. If Lewis gas
should be discharged in the heart of
this city, with its eight million pop
ulation, it would spread to the limits
of the city.
If Lewis gas was set loose in the
center of Chicago, which is but 10
miles square, it would envelop every
home, every building in the city.
There are no means, of detecting
Lewis gas until it comes in contact
with the body. It cannot be seen, or
heard, or smelled, or tasted.
It is heavier than air. It never
rises. It penetrates every crack and
crevice.
There is no defense against Lewis
gas. The air it poisons cannot be
purified by gas masks.
When Lewis gas touches human
flesh, the flesh immediately putrifies
—rots —and the purification extends
throughout the body, causing instant
death!
By wireless we can send out and
bring back an airplane that will dis
charge two tons of Lewis gas at a
given point.
This gas was invented by Prof.
Lewis, a chemist in one of our great
American universities. Our govern
ment was manufacturing it at Balti
more when the war closed. It was to
be sent at once for use by the allies.
It is believed that Germany knew it
was coming, and that this knowledge
hastened the armistice.
We do not know if other nations
have the formula for Lewis gas—
they do know that we have it, and
their chemists, of course, have been
studying and experimenting since the
war. No doubt the secret is known
to all the great nations.
Armies and navies will not fight
the wars of the future. There must
be no wars in the future if civiliza
tion is to endure.
There is nothing worthwhile if
wars are to continue. Yeoman
Shield.
TON ENFORCED THE LAW
promises to do all in the power of
the citizenry of Harrisburg to uphold
the tax law and other laws of the
land and “to support the happy Con
stitution and wise administration of
our government.”
In Washington’s day the struggle
was to resist a tax upon distillers.
The government, after more than a
century of tax enforcement, is now
striving to abolish the traffic then
recognized. In Washington’s day,
while the states were yet jealous of
the rights reserved to them, the local
governments thus upheld the govern
ment in the enforcement of Federal
law. Today, after taking the matter
of sumptuary legislation away from
the state, the national and local gov
ernments are “passing the buck” in
enforcement. Dearnborn Independ

I have in mind an American indus

to make all other businesses almost
insignificant by comparison. In num

quantity and value of product it is so
large that if we compare figures,
such organizations as Standard Oil,
the United States Steel Corporation,
or our railroads appear as dwarfs.
Editor In Chief
This industry is the occupation of
some 31,614,269 individuals in the
United States of America, according
to census figures of 1920. It has a
property investment of $77,924,100,-
338—a billion dollar industry seven
ty-seven times over.
It has 6,448,343 distinct productive
branches, each of which may be con
sidered as one of the units of a gi
gantic whole. It carries a bonded
indebtedness in the shape of mort
gages of $4,003,767,192, in addition
to what I may term a floating debt
of probably twice this amount.
This industry has been compelled
to face some serious problems dur
ing the past few years. In the year
of 1917 it produced wealth amount
ing to $19,331,000,000, measured by
the market value of its goods. In
1918 the same value rose to $22,480,-
000,000; in 1919 the figure reached
the tremendous total of $24,982,000,-
000. Two years later, in 1921, the
gross wealth produced, measured also
by market values, had dropped to
$12,367,000,000. Yet this loss of
value did not represent any decrease
in volume of production, which in
creased rather than diminished.
This business, which is that of my
readers, agriculture, is the founda
tion of all other industry. Yet,
through all history, those engaged in
it have had a desperate struggle to
obtain recognition of their import
ance in the genereal scheme of things.
The farmer has too often been con
sidered a creature of the soil, with
no rights of his own save a bare liv
ing, and with arduous duties to per
form for representative? of other
classes. Under what was known as
the feudal system in Europe the tiller
of the soil belonged to the land he
cultivated. He had no rights. If the
land changed hands, so did the culti
vator. Even his crop was not his
own. The lord or baron surveyed the
products of his serf, took all save
what he deemed would permit a bare
living to the worker and his family,
and, if there was protest, the whip,
the rope, or the ax was always avail
able.
Throughout many ages the great
battle of the farmer has been to at
tain a ranking or equality with other
classes. There is nothing new in ag
ricultural discontent. More than one
government has been overthrown,
more than one bloody war fought, in
the effort of agriculture to gain re
cognition.
The French revolution grew out of
oppression of the peasantry. Count
less minor uprisings in French his
tory resulted from the ill treatment
of the farmers by the nobility. In
Great Britain such men as Wat Tyler
and Jack Cade led mobs of farmers,
armed with scythes and pitchforks
against the armored ranks of the no
bility, and closed their careers on the
gallows.
Men now living remember the lib
eration of the serts in Russia. Slav
ery, in the United States, was only
a survival of the custom of the cen
turies of keeping the tiller of the
soil under an iron hand. An ignor
ant, czar-oppressed peasantry laid
the foundation for the soviet govern
ment in Russia, which finds its chief
stability in the hunger of peasants
for land.
Years ago there was a great deal
of talk about “the home.” Few peo
ple paid any attention to it. Most
of the utterances made concerning
home too much resembled preach
ment to be effective—that is, things
said because they weit expected to
be said. But today we are all in a
better position to understand what
was meant—we have seen the nations
of well-established homes weather
the most terrible cataclysms of his
tory, and the homeless nations fall.
Each home is a root of the national
tree, and the tree holds by the num
ber and strength of its roots.
Sinister confirmation of these
truisms has come in the subversive
influences which are at work in the
as yet unshaken nations. The first
attack is made on the home. All of
the destructive social movements are
sponsored by the people of nations
which had more hovels than homes
(because they were hovel-making in
stead of home-making peoples), and
it is significant that in this country
the work of destruction is taken up
by those who prefer transient habi
tations to homes. The home, like the
church, is under fire because it pre
sents a bulwark against the subver
sive forces of the world. By cheap
ening the marriage tie, by undermin

FIRST ATTA
The CALL OF THE NORTH
The history of every nation is full
of stories of rebellions of hungry,
poorly armed, and poorly led farmers
dgainst minority classes which have
profited ffcom their labors. Always
the farmer has had to fight for every
inch of progress he has made. The ex
isting uprising in Bulgaria is just
one more instance of a demand of
peasants for their rights.
In America, however, the farmer
has been more successful in escaping
from his historical lot than in the old
world. America has no peasantry, in
the European sense of the word. It
has no peonage, such as that of Mexi
co, where generation after generation
of Indian toilers has eked out a bare
existence cultivating the land for
the Spanish conquerors and their suc
cessors. But even in America it is
hard for many men to recognize the
justness of agriculture’s demands, or
to sympathize with the farmers who
declare that they must have a fair
price for their products.
In our own land, as elsewhere, the
farmer has been inclined to fight his
battles with poor equipment. At the
very start of our national government
General Washington himself was
compelled to put down a rebellion of
farmers in western Pennsylvania and
in the Alleghanies, due to the fact
that an excessively heavy tax had
been placed upon whisky. This ap
parently highly desirable tax, from a
moral viewpoint, was ruinous to the
settlers on the western side of the Al
leghanies, for, lacking transportation,
they could not market their com in
other form than that of liquor., These
farmers adopted the old practice of
starting a fight against superior
forces, instead of seeking more busi
nesslike solutions of their difficulties,
and as usual were beaten.
It is just as ridiculous for a farm
organization to seek to establish a co
operative business without proper
banking facilities jas it was for the
downtrodden peasants of France to
attempt to defeat the armies of their
lords with knives and sticks. It is
just as impractical for farmers to
seek to establish their business on a
sound foundation without organiza
tion as it was for unorganized mobs
of Russian serfs to attempt to whip
the troops of the imperial govern
ment.
I have called attention to the mag
nitude of agriculture as a business in
the United States. The figures I have
given are taken from United States
census reports. They may or may
not be entirely accurate, but they are
sufficient to prove to any that ag
riculture is big enough and strong
enough to stand dh its own feet.
Farm organieation after farm or
ganization has risen and passed away
in the last century. Farmer move
ment after farmer movement has been
inaugurated, has accomplished more
or less of its aims, and has fallen
back. But in all the history of farm
organization, I do not find a single
evidence of sustained effort, backed
by anything like a majority of our
agricultural population, to attack the
problems on an organized, systematic,
business basis.
We will presume, for example, that
the business to which I have referred
was not agriculture, but steel. How
long would it be, my friends, if the
steel industry were to be found as
disorganized as agriculture always
has been, until the Morgans, the
Schwabs, the Carnegies and the
Garys would be getting together to
do something about it? How long
would it take to form an organization
of at least a majority of the 6,448,-
343 owners of individual plants (that
being the number of farms in the
United States) to insure a fair price
for the product?
K THE HOME
an artificial spirit of worldly wiseness
in the young, by all the processes -of
divorce, entertainment, bad literature
and the general trivializing of our
common life, the doors have been
opened to other and more degenera
tive influences in the general social
life.
* •*! r * f
It is a matter of common observa
tion over a long period that the so
cial fabric begins to rot with the
weakening of the home. The best
defense of law and order and pro
gressive justice is the success of
those elements which defend and
strengthen the home. We could well
afford in this country for the next
decade to regulate all our industry
and politics and finance with one sin
gle paramount object in mind, the
welfare of the home.
Nothing is more useless than plati
tudes on this subject. Attend first
to the welfare of the home, put a
sound economic condition arotmd all
its spiritual elements, and upon our
economic consideration we shall find
the other elements growing to un
paralleled strength. As long as the
American home stands, this nation
never will succumb to the poisonous
airs with which satanic forces are
now filling the world.—Dearnborn In

26,000,000 SILEN
At the last preseidental election
less than„half the people who were
qualified voted. More than 26 million
did not vote. Less than that number
did vote. A majority of the minority
rule this country. The worst element
votes—those who desire laws adopt
ed that gives them special privileges;
or laws repealed that deprive them
of special privileges; or officers elect
ed who will wink at crime. The
bought vote, the corrupt vote, is al
ways in the ballot box.
If everyone refrained from voting,
as the majority of our people do, our
government would fall, for it is based
on exercise of the franchise.
A ringing call from the National
League of Women Voters meets with
heartiest approval. Among the in
spiring proceedings at the recent an
nual convention held at Des Moines,
lowa, none outranks the sturdy reso
lution of the women to bring out at
least 75 per cent of the qualified
voters in the 1924 election.
If Great Britain can bring out 80
per cent of the voters and Germany
89 per cent, we surely ought to be
able to reach 75 per cent. Yet in
the last preseidental election a poor
49 per cent of eligible voters cast
their ballots. Less than this percent
age of voters was registered at the
polls in state elections for governor,
and much less in local elections. The
situation loudly demands improve
ment.
It seems almost grotesque that
men, who would doubtless risk their
very lives to maintain the right of
suffrage, show so little interest in
exercising that right. In their own
way, women fought with equal ear
nestness to secure the ballot. Yet
they, 00, have been lacking when it
came to using it. The recent hotly
contested senatorial election in Min
nesota brought out apparently less
than half the eligible voters. Men
and women hold the illogical position
of being ready to do and dare all for
the principle of representative gov
ernment, and being too indifferent to
exert the little energy that would
make it working fact.
When 49 per cent or less of the
qualified voters cast their ballot we
get minority rule. There must be a
great lack of right understanding so
to hold back the tardy voters. They
fail to realize just what opportunities
they are neglecting and just how
their votes could better conditions.
Government, after all, seems to
many a far away sort of authority in
which they have little personal in
terest. Shrouded in mystery, it is
quite beyond the powers, and almost
beyond the concern, of ordinary mor
tals. It doesn't seem to them to
touch their daily lives at all.

But when a native-born Protestant
American dares to exercise similar
privileges by placing a souvenir of
America’s greatest fraternal order on
display ig Kansas City, the matter is
entirely different.

the courts when his place of business

THE WEST I
William Allen White, the noted
Kansas editor, diagnoses the discon
tent of the west as follows:
What does the election of Johnson
of Minnesota signify in political and
economic terms? I have been think
ing it out pretty carefully for sev
eral days. In fact( for more thaft a
year I have been feeling that the
economic conditions here in what
might be called the western Missis
sippi basin would take a strongly
marked political turn.
In prosperous times there is enough
margin i agriculture and those local
industries dependent upon agricul
ture here in the middle west to give
the farmer and his friends a profit.
So he is peaceful. But when the eco
nomic pinch comes the farmer feels it
and he is intelligent enough to real
ize that he is suffering from a remedi
able wrong.
He may be unwise in looking to
politics for his remedy but he does
look to politics for a remedy and when
he gets into politics he raises the very
devil. The middle west farmer of
lowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin was
an accomplice in the Peter CoopSt
movement and the greenback move
ment nearly fifty years ago. The
railroad legislation of the mid-seven
ties was rightly called farmer legisla
tion.
Thirty years ago the famer* of
Kansas, Nebraska and the Dakotas
truth. An increasing number of in
dividuals and organizations now per
ceive that what is needed is education
of the electorate. The kind of edu
cation that will bring home to Bill
Jones at the cross roads that he
won't have nearly so good a chance
to get the things he wants unless
he informs himself about the ques
tions of the day and about the can
didates for office in his own coun
try, and then votes for the best man.
He must be shown that he and all
his fellows must vote in order to elect
the man who will be favorable to the
building of a new hygienic, fire-proof
school house which will insure the
health and lives of his children.
That it depends mightily upon who
is in office whether the county roads
will continue to be so neglected that
the cost of hauling produce to mar
ket is prohibitive.
There is firm ground for the ex
pressed belief of the league that
“Only when a ihajority of the citi
zens are intelligently and actively in
terested in public affairs, is good
government assured.” Once men and
women have fully grasped the fact
that government begins at home,
right here in their own community,
their own ward or precinct, and
thence stretches out in all directions
to include their every relation to the
world they live in, neither conscience
nor self-interest will permit them to
neglect casting their votes.
The League of Women Voters, with
its enthusiasm and ingenuity, has de
vised many methods for gaining its
goal of 75 per cent of the voters in
1924. It is inspiring to see what
they are doing to arouse our citizenry
to a sense of their obligation in re
spect to casting votes and being in
formed as to issues and candidates.
Lectures, literature, institutes, sur
veys, personal endeavor, house to
house interviews, radio, all carry the
message. It involves a lot of hard
work, but they think it is worth that.
They have proved they are not afraid
of work, and they know how to make
it count for something. They over
look no field—large or small.
Very significant are such little suc
cesses as the president, Mrs. Maud
Wood Park, noted in her address to
the convention when she called atten
tion to the results of the women’s
efforts in a certain small town at last
November’s elections. Only one wo
man in the place failed to vote, and
she was ill in bed.
Certainly this is a worthy cause,
and one to which so public spirited a
group of women might well dedicate
themselves. The closer the relation
ship between citizen and government,
the more accurate the reflection of
the public mind in the government’s
policies.—Yeoman Shield.

Each of these movements, futile in
itself, left a permanent impression

demand for direct election of United

the direct primary, and a lot of pro

It is a curious thing that when the

THE WANTONNESS OF
THE UTEHAHY DIOEST
(From The Protestant, Nov., 1923)
Nothing could demonstrate much
more conclusively the abject slavery
of THE LITERARY DIGEST to
Rome than its handling of the usur
pation and defiance of law in Okla
homa by Governor John C. Walton,
a brother-in-law to the Church of
Rome.
On September 29 that magazine de
voted two pages to press comment,
supplemented by its own, on the Ok
lahoma Governor’s terrorism and de
fiance of the Legislature in his fur
ious effort to exterminate the Ku
Klux Klan. After devoting virtual
ly all that space to utterances of the
controlled press most notoriously hos
tile to the Klan, the DIGEST pretend
ed to give “what Klan representatives
have to say” by devoting one inch of
space to a brief excerpt from COL
ONEL MAYFIELD’S WEEKLY at
Houston.
The Mayfield periodical is not a
Klan publication at all, though under
stood to be friendly to that organiza
tion. THE PROTESTANT knows that
the DIGEST had a brief but power
ful telegram sent to it personally by
the editor of THE FIERY CROSS
at Indianapolis, which is an official
Klan publication. But that temper
ate and truthful and withering mess
age was too forceful. THE DIGEST
dared not use it.
Neither did it dare quote from the
DAILY OKLAHOMAN leading news
paper in Oklahoma, though that pa
per had wired messages to the daily
press beyond the borders of the State
in order to correct the misinformation
so industriously disseminated. Nor
did the DIGEST dare quote the daily
TULSA TRIBUNE, on which Gov
ernor Walton had fastened military
censorship and threatened to suspend
the paper for publishing the truth.
The field of controlled journalism
contains no more dangerous publica
tion than THE LITERARY DIGEST.
Its pretense of candor and impartial
ity is carried out with enough clever
ness that honest and unsuspecting
people in general do not suspect and
are reluctant to believe that ite slav
ery to Rome is total and unmitigated.
By that policy it worms its way into
many public schools to warp and poi
son the plastic minds of boys and
girls in the interest of political Ro
manism.
On a former occasion that maga
zine, after publishing many columns
of mendacious assertions against Pro
testant activities, ventured to give a
brief statement by Rev. Bob Shuler.
The papal lash instantly whipped the
offending DIGEST into abject apology
and penance in sack cloth and ashes.
It will probably not be required thus
to humiliate itself because of the one
inch given to an outside statement in
defense of the Klan after using two
pages against the hated patriotic
body.

EDUCATION BILL
ISSUE IN CONGRESS
—K-K-K
Traitors to Little Red School House
Can Be Only Means in De
feating Measure
—K-K-K
Washington, D. C.—With 740 Pro
testants and only 42 Catholics in the
68th Congress, which assembled here
Monday, only a powerful underground
lobby that would turn Protestants
traitor to the public school will be
possible to defeat the Education bill
providing for federal aid to public
schools and a secretary of education
in the president’s cabinet.
As Congress opened it was the plan
to introduce the bill immediately and
press the measure to a speedy issue.
The bill will be constructed similar
to the Towner-Sterling Educational
bill of the last Congress. Senator
Sterling was to introduce the issue
in the Senate. Judge Towner, who
introduced the measure in the House
in the last session, is now governor
of Porto Rico.
President Coolidge has promised
serious and favorable consideration
of the measure to a delegation rep
resenting educational and other or
ganizations favorable to the bill, with
a total membership of over 2,500,000,
which waited upon him with Dr.
George D. Strayer of New York, pre
senting the matter.
The Educational bill is the greatest
matter of interest in the eyes of
Protestant America that will come
before the present Congress. The
next in importance is the considera
tion of an immigration quota to re
place the 3 per cent restriction which
will soon expire.
Catholic America, which was suffi
ciently strong to cause the Towner-
Sterling bill to die in committee dur
ing the last Congress, is watching the
present session with the same inter
est that Protestantism is manifesing,
but with the sole aim of defeating the
measure.
The summary of the personnel in
the 68th Congress would assure the
success of the Educational bill.
Failure in passage will mean but one
thing—that many Protestant sena
tors and representatives have turned
traitor o heir faih and the little red
school house;
