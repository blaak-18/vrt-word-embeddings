T'ey whispered low: -She will pass away,
At the turn of the sea to-day.
To the place where clay 1- clay."
When the tide goes out.
The time h2s come when her soul must slip
Its moorings with these earthly ships,
Fcr the seal obdeath is on her lips,
As the tide goes out.
Ntay, only to drift to other lands.
Feel the touch of kindred hands,
Press her feet to the golden sands.
When the tide goes out.
She may lay her treasures at HIs feet.
I-o who made her life complete;
Who sailed away when life was sweet.
When the tide went out.
Life itself must begin at last.
For them when the harbor-bar i.i pissed:
And the anchor of death is surely cast, t
When the tide goes out.
For the flotsam of life shall come drifting in,
Beyond the rocks of doubt and sin.
And God's sweet peace shall enter In,

A JUDG#S PREDICAMENT
BY JOUl RIDOARD.
It was in October of 1892.
1 was in the smoker of the North
Shore limited, speeding northward
along the shore of the Hudson and, as
the increasing darkness obscured the
view of the river and the Catskills, my
attention was drawn to a couple of
gentlemen who sat nearly opposite me
on the other side of the car. They
were evidently old friends and were
engaged in animated conversation-so
animated, in fact, that it came clearly
to my ears. We were the only passen
gers in the coach and, doubtless, my
late preoccupation led them to disre
gard my presence in the fancied se
curity of the noise of the train. It was
far from my thoughts to become an
eavesdropper, but I had no reason to
suppose there was anything confiden
tial in their talk until I had become so
interested in what I had heard that I
smothered all scruples and listened to
the end.
"I would never have known him,"
said one of the two men, the farther
one from me, "though perhaps that is
not strange, for I had not seen him for
twenty years. Yet I knew you, old fel
low, the moment we met. It is won
derful how little you have changed,
for all your gray hairs," and he put
his hand affectionately on the other's
knee.
"I have held my own pretty well,"
said the other, and his bright and still
youthful face flashed back an answer
ing smile, "nor can I see much change
in you, George-a little stouter, some
what more staid, but that is all. What
a streak of luck this is that I should
have met you this afternoon when you
landed and that we should have this
ride to Chicago together."
"lunt, say, Jack - this is the first
chance I have had to ask you-what
the deuce is the matter with Phil? IHe
has not only changed in appearance,
but has radically changed in manner.
Why, he is as fidgety as an old woman.
I don't think he was half glad to see
me. In the olden time he was jolly
enough and a right good fellow; but
to-day he hurried off on board his
steamer two hours ahead of time,when
we hadn't been together a minute.
Really, I felt hurt."
"You are misjudging him, George.
lie is a good fellow and thinks just as
much of you as he ever did. But he is
not himself just now, and there is
every reason why he should not be.
There isa story connected with our trip
to New York which, in justice to him, I
ought to tell you. I an sure he would
wish me to do so.
"I don't know that you are aware
that Phil has been very successful in
in his profession. He is judge-" and
the speaker's voice here sank so low
that I missed a few words. "When he
got to Chicago he took rooms for him
self and wife some six or eight blocks
south of the world's fair grounds-and,
by the way, he has a charming wife.
I must tell you to call upon her, for
she is-still there, at the Palmer house.
She is to remain there until I return.
"Well, Phil and his wife put in a
couple of weeks at the fair. I met
them there frequently and we had
many pleasant hours together. They
had seats reserved at the Auditorium.
When the time came Phil's wife was
tired and didn't care to go. This more
than inclined Phil to give up going,
but lihe finally decided that he would
not lose this his only chance of seeing
a very fine spectacular play that had
drawn great crowds during the fair.
Before he came to Chicago he had pur
chased an elegant, self-cocking revolver
-a thing he had never owned before
and on that evening, at his wife's re
quest, he put it in his hip pocket.
"He took a street car for the fair
grounds, intending to take a train
there for the city. There was appar
ently no standing room in the crowded
car, and it was with the greatest dif
.fiulty that he secured a footing on the
rear pttform.
"The car lhad gone but two or three
blocks when it stopped at a crossing.
The pressure increased, people trod
upon his feet and dug their elbows into
his sides in their efforts to make way
for some one who wascoming from the
inside of the car.
"The subiect of- all this commotion
came crowding by him toward the
steps. In passing him the stranger
stumbled, muttered a word of apology
and then, hurrying on, reached the
steps and alighted. As he did so Phil
caught the gleam of gold in the man's
hand.
"Instinctively he clapped his hand to
his breast---his watch and chain were
gone. They had belonged to his fa
ther. He could not lose them.
"The ear had started, but in a twin
kling Phil sprang to the ground. The
man had reached the sidewalk, and as
he passed under the street lamp Phil
saw that he was fumbling about his
vest, as if attaching a chain to
a buttonhole. The houses are much
scattered in that neighborhood and
there was no one else in sight.
"Drawinwlg his revolver, Phil ran soft
.- but swiftfly aftert him. The man
was Ino*Ine btUrIly 4own thb .d14
street and seemingly did not hear the
approaching steps until Phil was al
most upon him, when he started, as is
to run, then stopped and faced his pur
suer. lie was dressed in black, his face
was clean shaven and deathly pale, and
he trembled visibly. With revolver
leveled full at the man's face Phil
shouted:
" 'Hlands up or you are a dead man.
"The man looked into Phil's face,
glanced down the gleaming barrel of
the revolver which was within a few
inches of his nose and threw up his
hands.
"Still holding his weapon aimed at
the man's head, Phil thrust his disen
gaged hand into the man'spocket, took
out the watch, tore the chain free from
its fastening, slipped watch and chain
into his pocket, and then sternly said:
" 'Go down this street and don't turn
around.'
"There was a deadly menace in his
tone, and the man headed westward
down the street and vanished in the
distance.
"And now a feeling akin to terror
came over Plhil. The exhilaration of
excitement passing away left him nerv
ous and fearful.
"Robberies and murders are not un
common in the city and in the ter
ritory about the fair grounds. Every
shadow was to him an assassin, every
noise a stealthy footstep! The thief
might have confederates. He could see
afar off the light of a coming car, but
what might happen before the car
could reach him? All desire to go to
the theater had left him.
"At first he walked rapidly, then
broke into a run, keeping in the mid
dle of the street, and heading for his
own rooms. Breathless, he dashed into
his wife's presence and nervously
bolted the door behind him.
"' 'hat in the world is the matter?'
she cried.
"Then he regained his balance. With
something of pride he told her of the
crowded car, the stranger, and dra
matically gesticulating with the re
volver in his hand, he described the re
covery of his stolen watch.
"With amazement upon her face and
alarm in her voice. she exclaimed:
"'0, Phil! What have you done?
There is your watch upon the dresser!'
"And there it was lying where he re
membered now to have laid it.
"Startled, frightened, he plunged his
hand into his trousers' pocket and
drew forth-another man's watch and
chain!
"Poor Phil collapsed.
"The morning papers contained an
account of a peculiarly daring highway
robbery committed the night before.
Rev. Somebody-I forget his name
from somewhere in Illinois, being in a
crowded car, had taken off his valu
able watch and chain-tokens of the
affection of his beloved congregation
and held them in his hand for greater
security. A highwayman, having
probably seen them, had boldly con
fronted him. The reverend gentleman
being taken by surprise and being,
moreover, a man of peace, had yielded
them up under the muzzle of a re
volver. But the police had clews which
would lead to the detection of the per
petrator of the outrage. The robber
was a strikingly handsome man, of
fine presence and wore a full, blonde
beard. He had been identified by the
street car conductor, as one who, ac
companied by a well-dressed little
lady, had rftlden with him several
times before. Also, a man answering
to the same description had been seen
with the same lady upon the fair
grounds.
"This finished Phil and he wired me
at my hotel to come to them. I found
them shut up in their rooms. lie
wouldn't let his wife go to the restau
rant for her breakfast. I had to ar
range to have their meals brought to
them. If ever a man's appearance could
convict him, his would have sent him
to the penitentiary.
"I urged him to make a clean breast
of the whole matter, but he would not
consent. He said it would ruin him.
Even if he could escape criminal liabil
ity, he could not survive the ridicule
which would follow. No, he must
avoid detection.
"The first thing was to return the
property. I packed it in a box and
mailed it to the police department.
The receipt of this only called out a
fresh deluge of newspaper comments.
It was sagely announced that the thief,
foreseeing the impossibility of eseap
ing arrest, had made reparation in a
vain effort to delude the detectives, but
that he was known and would be ap
prehended within twenty-four hours.
"'There was great danger that the
pdple in the house would observe the
similarity in Phil's appearance to the
published description of the robber."
"Vhy didn't he go home?"
"I urged him to do so and so did his
wife, but he imagined that every paper
in the country would be fall of the
story, and that his- presence there
would suggest a likeness which would
lead to discovery. IHe was like a
hunted hare. lie dared not stir from
his room. Every voice in the house
was some one inquiring for him, every
step an officer coming to arrest him.
It was pitiable. At length, in spite of
our remonstrances, he decided to go
abroad till the thing blew over. lie
trumped up an excuse for his wife to
give at home for his sudden trip. She,
closely veiled and with as much change
as possible in her apparel, left the
house and went to a hotel in the city.
Phil shaved off his beard, and, wearing
a suit of my clothes, met me at the
depot. He insisted that I should come
with him to New York, and see him on
the steamer, and this was what brought
me down.
"You wouldn't have thought it pos
sible, George, that a man of Phil's
strength of mind could have worked
himself into such an idiotic condition.
When he gets on the ocean and away
from all possible danger, he will
awaken from this nightmare of fear
and will appreciate the ludicrous-"
The rear door of the coach opened,
two or three gentlemen entered. sand

very cold or whipped cream. Suffi
cient for six persons.-1Mrs. Charles A.
Bryant, in Home.
-Milk Custards: This delicious des
sert is variously termed rennet custard,
slip, or junket, the difference lying
only in flavor or in a more generous
use of eggs. Slip, in its simplest form,
is merely rich milk, slightly flavored
and sweetened, and "set" with liquid
rennet, a large tablespoonful being re
quired to a quart. This is a most re
freshing dessert for a hot day, and pos
sesses a great advantage in being so
easily prepared. A beaten egg or two,
a spoonful of wine and a dash of nut
meg, and slip is converted into junket.
Serve with cream. It may be further
varied by the ad dition of a few spoon
fuls of fruit-juice well sweetened and
carefully stirred in, or even a handful
of berries, in their season, which im
part color as well as flavor to the dish.
If one chances to be near a cheese fac
tory or creamery, one can usually ob
tain rennet much more cheaply than
at a drug-store.-Country Gentleman.
HATS AND THEIR WEARERS.
The Mladonna Girl, the Poet's Ideal, is the
itago at Present.
The bonnet whose plumes stand
straight up to a great height from a
modest Dutch band, looks a great deal
like a Fiji head-dress, but if it be
styled a Dutch bonnet the suggestiou
of the South seas is not amiss. For,
be it known, the Dutch bonnet is on
top in a double sense; it reigns
throughout the country, and women
find it universally becoming, too. Isn't
it funny women are so modest? They
confess with delight that each fashion
proves becoming, instead of realizing
that it is their own everlasting charm
that is proven. No matter what she
puts on, a pretty woman is going to
be sightly. It is necessary only that
she should not look strangely different
from other girls that her prettiness
may be recognized. So it is that all
tumble unto the same fashions with
fitful frenzy. Harmony being thus se
cured, beauty gets its invariable rec
ognition. All the same, the Madonna
girl and the big girl with rather heavy
features and fine eyes is having her
time just now.
A fetching toque is thus described:
It is of sapphire blue velvet, which is
arranged in a series of puffs and loops
in front and around the brim, dimin
ished in size at the back. On either
side toward the front, feathery aig
rettes are placed. A pretty variation
on the neck ruche binds big roses to
gether in a strand of bright ribbon.
The ribbon ties in front under the
chin, is fitted smoothly in at the col
lar and sweeps stiffliy and primly over
the blouse front, turning under with
it to tuck in with it at the belt. Cor
responding bands are added to each
side and fit closely. Almost all the
new bodices wvill show this effect or
some modification of it. Very slender
women may try the bodice bloused in
the back as well as in the front, but
the experiment is risky for anybody
but a "bean pole."-Boston Traveller.
Coming Colors.
Green and white in combination will
rival the mixture of green and violet
in lovely things for summer. WVhite
cloth coats and capes with green lin
ings, sheer white wool toilets, plain
or dotted or striped with green, will be
made up with very full green sleeves,
bretelles, or cape-collars, and belt rib
bons. Golden green, reseda, Dresden,
and apple-green toilets in all the ele
gant or dainty textiles will be in high
est favor, and to make them more be
cominrg to those whom the color does
not wholly suit, full eollarettes,jabots,
bretelles, or immense Venetian cape
collars of softest ecru lace will inter
pose between this rather trying tint
and veil and tone it, so that in most
cases it will prove complimentary.
Softened and modified with lace, many
shades of green are found most be
coming to women who thus keep the
tints from direct contact with the
sompleion.,-N. Y. Poet, -
FUN IN A SHIPWRECK.
Ludicrous Inc*ents Descrilbed by an Old
Salt Who Was Thirsty.
"I shall never forget my experience
in the southern ocean in tile winter of
'73," said the sailor-looking man in a
reminiscent toile.
The other passengers in the smoker
naturally asked him to tell it, they all
having exhausted their supply of yarns
and anecdotes. So, after alittle press
ing, the sailor man proceeded.
"It was in the winter of '73 that I
was mate aboard the Nancy Jane, from
New York for Valparaiso. It was just
after doubling the cape that the trou
ble began; and right here let me say
the cape was bad enough without dou
bling it, but orders is orders on ship
board.
"About noon it fell dead calm, which
made us all look alive for a gale. It
came on soon enough, and our masts
went by the board, leaving us without
a stick of timber. However, we had
plenty of cordwood, and managed to
keep a fire going in the galley.
"This was lucky, for without the fire
of course we couldn't have cooked the
eggs for breakfast. I forgot to say
that early in the gale the ship laid to.
"But the ship was doomed and our
hearts began to sink; so did the ship.
We manned one boat with the women,
and just as the cock crew the crew got
into the other. We had no provisions
save a few fire crackers, and after
drifting about for a week-and a weak
lot we were-our boat struck a rock,
the first thing we had struck since our
grub gave out, and we took in a supply
of water.
"Then we threw the painter over
board, and the carpenter and the rest
of us pulled the boat ashore. The other
boat capsized, but all hands were saved,
though one man lost both arms by get
tidg them caught in a coil of rope. We
were a hard-looking set, not one of us
having seen soap or fresh water since
having left the ship, but we looked
better after having been washed ashore.
"We found that we had landed on an
island. There was a great swell on
shore-the first day, and,we afterward
saw a little cove running inland, but
there were no other signs of life.
"We had nothing to live on but the
country, and fortunately there was
plenty of that, but it soon became mo
notonous, and we longed for a change
of diet. About the third day one of
the women descried a sail-a woman
always has an eye out for a sale, you
know-and as we saw the stranger
hugging the shore we hugged ourselves
for joy.
"The vessel came as near as she
could, then threw over a plank and we
all got aboard, and we enjoyed the
board hugely and filled up promptly.
Then the sails filled and we were off
and away.
"The vessel was a bark, built of dog
wood, and a good sailer, though some
of us had thought that dog wouldn't
float. She was called the Haromasia,
and-"
"And never existed except in your
imagination, you old fraud," shouted
the crowd with one voice, and you
have been only reeling off a lot of
cheap puns, confound you!"
And they turned from him as from
one accursed.-B-oston Transcript.
HOME OF THE GENII.
Great Hall la China In Which Hundreds
of Idols Are Huddled.
Five hundred of the Gods of China
are collected in the hall of the house
of the Genii at Canton. If you were to
ask the most learned and devout
Chinese which is the greatest of these
divinities, or to name a few of them
that are superior to the others in posi
tion and .potency, he would probably
be deeply puzzled. There is, in fact,
utter confusion in the spirit world of
the Chinese. Such a mixing up of au
thority and attributes among human
beings would result in a chaotic and
hopeless condition of affairs. Even
when the great dieties that stand for
the three religions are brought into
juxtaposition, sometimes one occupies
the center, the post of honor, and
sometimes another. To-day it may be
Confucius, to-morrow Buddha, and the
next day Laotze.
So in this great house of the Genii at
Canton the images of the gods are hud
dled helter-skelter together, the ar
rangement frequently changing, ac
cording to the whim or caprice of the
attendants, and nobody is able to tell
why there should be any change atall.
Some of these images represent the
spirits of the great religious teachers,
or of the emperors, who are always
deified whether they were good or bad
in the flesh; others may represent
merely the hedgehog, the fox, the
weasel, the snake or the rat, all of
which are supposed to exercise an im
portant influence upon human affairs.
They are dubbed "his excellency" on
the printed placards which distin
guish one from another, and the most
learned scholars are not ashamed, on
the days set apart for the worship of
these lowly spirits, to be seen at their
genufiexions before the images.
Good and evil spirits in this house of
the Genii have equal place and equal
reverence. Why should not the wicked
spirits be humbly entreated, if their
evil passions may thus be mollified and
they induced to visit the misfortunes
they command upon some less reverent
person? It is a queer jumble of the
three potent creeds that have a firm
foothold in China. It is a strange con
fusion of such a multiplicity of gods as
is seen nowhere else in the world; and
the reason of it seems to be that the
great mass of Chinese are willing to
blend in their faith and practice all
the religions that have been stamped
in their own land with the zeal of an
tiquity. By seeming at least to re
spect all, they hope to win blessings in
this world and the next; and not even
the lofty teachings of Confucius and
Buddharelease them from superstitious
fear of the hobgoblins and dilemons of
Taoism.-N. Y. Sun.

-A curious breach of the Sunday law
came up recently in a London court.
The International Tract society, the
agent of a Sabbatarian Christian sect
which preaches the observance of
Saturday instead of Sunday, was conm
plained of for violating the factories
act by employing labor on Sunday. Al
though the law makes provision for
Jews working on Sunday, it does not
for Christians, and though it was
shown that no work was (lone by the
society on Saturday, and that Friday
was kept as a half holiday, a fine was
imposed.

Two married ladies were talking
about their respective and respected
Lords.
"Does your husband forget things?"
asked one.
"Never," said the other.
"WVell, mine does. I think there is
hardly a day when he comes home from
his office that he doesn't begin to apolo
giae for his forgetfulness. Of course,
I have to accept tl~ apology on his
promise to do better, and the next day
the very same thing ~curs."
"That must be extremlely annoying."
"It is. Sometimes: I get so vexed
with him that I realy have to scold
him."
"And that never is piasant."
"I should say not. l' sure I'd rathex
be anything else than F old, but some
husbands actually drive their wives to
it. I've been marrie4 ten years, and
sometimes 1 almost fear if he doesn't
improve he will have my temper utter

"I'veo been married a dozen years and
[ never have any such trouble."
"May be your husband is an excep
tion?"
"No; he's only average as married
men go."
"Wasn't he ever forgetful?"
"He was at first, but I cured him of
it-"
"Gracious, I thought it was incura
ble." '
"Oh, no. You can cure him easily If
you will use my remedy."
"I'm sure I'll only be too glad to

They happened to meet on the street
that day. and.as he turned to walk back
with her he said:
"I've juastcome from your house, Mis!
Edith, and I hope you will like what I
have left there."
"O, I'm sure I shall; you always have
such lovely taste. I, too, have je;si
sent you a trifle which I hope you mlti
find to your liking."
"O, lMiss Edith, you know I couldn't
help liking anything you would soe
lect."
"O, I can hardly wait to get home te
see what you have brought me." .
"I, too, am curious to know what my
present is. But where have you been?'
"I just came from May's; I had in.
tended to remain all afternoon, but
that horrid little dog of hers made me
so nervous that I really couldn't stay.'
"Don't you like dogs?"
"O, yes, some dogs, but this is one of
those horrid little pugs-I never coulc
bear a pug."
"0O, Miss Edith, I thought you-"
"Had too much good sense to like
the horrid things? Thank you. I knew
you would understand me, you always
do."
"I-er--isn't that Dick Brownsmith
coming towards us?"
"Why, it is. What a well-dressed
man he is!"
"Rather, yes-that is, barring his
ties. I never could think anything of
a man who wears red neckties."
"WVhy. I thought you-"
"WVould never be seen wearing such
a thing? Thank you for your good
opinion. I won't."
"I--ah-well, here we are at home:
you will come in: won't you?"
"Why, er-no--that is, I really haven't
time. I-I must go home and see the
lovely gift you have sent me."
"O, don't ")e in a hurray about that.
You really ought to come in to see my
surprise and pleasure when I first see
your charming present."
"You are sure to be surprised, atany
rate, Miss Edith," said the young man,.
with a sickly smile, as he backed down
the steps.

they are both wondering what to say

HIS DIAGNOSIS.
Mike lKnew the Principal Pointae n Medical
P'ractiee.
A man named Mlike Dooley has been
employed for a number of years as
driver by a well-known physician, who
fell ill and died. Mlike was disconso
late over his employer's death. He
was out of a job, and unfitted for any
other employment save driving a doc
tor's buggy from patient to patient
and napping during the visits. He sat
around the house in a morose and
mournful sort of way until his ener
getic wife grew weary.
"Pihy don't yez sthir yezs'f an' do
sumthin'?" she inquired with indigna
tion.
"Shure, an' phwat kin Oi do?" he re
turned.
"Do!" she repeated. "Av Oi d bin
wid a dochter foortane years an' sax
munts Oi'd know enuff t' be a dochter
mois'f."
Mlike brightened up. He knew noth
ing, of course, about medicine, except
a few grandiloquent phrases he had
heard his master use in its praises.
However, lie hung out his sign and
next day a woman called.
"Is the doctor in?" she asked.
"Oi'm th' dochter, mnom," responded
M ike.
"Then I wish you would tell me what
is the matter with me," she remarked
in the plaintiff tone of a chronic in
valid.
"Twinty dollars, mom, av you plaze,"
said Miike, sententiously.
The woman demurred.
"Scoience, mom, an' a knowledge av
tarrespootics air on'y acquired boi dthe
axpindatoor ov grate toil an' toime an'
munny; so, mom, my fays air inwaira
bly in advance."
When Mike fired that at her she
gave up the twenty without another
word.
"Let me see yure tung, mom," de
manded aMike. The woman obeyed.
"Lit me fale yure pools," he con
tinued, and she extended her hand.
"Lit me beer dthe b'atin' av yure
hairt," and Mlike, with an air of seri
ous study, laid his shock head against
the patient's bosom.. After a moment
he drew it away with a jump.
"The woorst fears air realoized,
mom!" he exclaimed; "yez have a wart
