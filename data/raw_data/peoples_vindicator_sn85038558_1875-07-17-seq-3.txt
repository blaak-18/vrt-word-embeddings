.glgnAL FORREST TALKS TO THE COL
01xW PEOPLE OF TENNESSEE ON
THIE GLORIOUS FOURTH.
President Henley, of the colored so
cieties, then said: "General Forrest,
;1uow r" to introduce to you Miss
,ou Lewis, who, as the representa
,Fve.of.tbe colored ladies, will present
you with a bouquet to assure you of
.he, ioenity they entertain for the
4objeots of this occasion [cheers] and
o offering of peace."
blissLon Lewis then advanced to
where General Forrest was standing
and presented the bouquet with the
following remarks:
SAenernl F orest, allow me to pre
ent you this bouquet as a token of
enciliation andan offering of peace
and good will." :[Applause.]
aWEPONS OF GE ERAL FORREST.
Gnu.Feoreset eceived the bouquet,
add in response said:
Laddic and Geatlemes--I accept the
fowers as a memento of reconciliation
between the white and colored races
of the Southern States. I accept it
more particularly as it comes from a
clored lady, for if there is any one
,an God's earth who loves the ladies
I believeit is myself. [Immense ap
sne and laughter.] This day is a
ay that is proudto me, having occn
died the position that I did for the
, twelve years, and been misun
by yeour race This is the
rst oppoertunity I have had during
that time to say that I am your friend.
I am here a representative of the
ouathern people, once memp slandered
;ad maligned than :any man it the
nation. I wll say 'o yes and to the
colored ace that he men who bore
arms and followed the flag of the Con
federacy are, with very few exeep
tions, your friends. I have an oppor
tunity of saying what I have always
felt-that I am your friend, for my
iaterests are your interests, and your
intereetare my interests. We were
born on the same soil, breathe the
-me air, and live in the same land.
Why, then, can we not live as broth
ep If will say that when the war
broke out I felt it my duty to stand
by my people. When the time came
lhdt the best I could, and I don't be'
lirevlf ickered. I came here with
the jeers of some white people, who
think that I am doing wrong. I be
lieve that I can exert some influence,
sad do much to assist the people in
$engthening fraternal relations, and
Jhall do all in my power to bring
*ant peace. It has always been my
mdte to elevate every man-to de

WEEKLY AND DAILY FOR 1875
The approach of the Presidential elec
tion gives unusual importance to the
events and developmenlits of 157.5. We
shall endeavor to describe them fully,
f aitlhfilly, and fiIearlessly.
THE WEEKLY SUN has now attain
od a circulation of over seventy thon
sand copites. Its readers are found inll
) every State and Torritory, and its quali
ty is well known to the public. We
shall not only endeavor to keep, it fully
iup to the old standard, but to improve
and add to its variety and power.
' THE WEEKLY SUN will continue to
I be a thor.ugi newspalper. All the news
of the day will be ftund in it, condens
ed when unimportant, at full length
- when li f inollt, andl always, we trust,
I treatied in a clear, interesting and in
structive mannaer.
It is o,r aim to make the Weekly Sim
the best family newspaper in the world.
It will be full of entertainiug and ap
propriatet reading of every sort, but will
print nothing to offend the' most scruln
lous and delicate taste. It will always
contain the mlost interesting stories and
romances of the day, carefully selected
and legibly lrilted.
The Agricultural Department is a
prominent feature in the Weekly Sun,
and its articles will always be found
fresh and useful to the farmer.
The numbler of meon independent in
politics is increasing, and the Weekly
Sunn is their paper especially. It belongs
to no party, .and obeys no dictation, con
tending for principle, and for the election
of the best men. It exposes the corrup
tion that disgraces the country and
threatens the overthrow of republican
institutions. It has no fear of knaves,
and seeks no favors from their support
ers.
The mark,.ts of every kind and the
fashions are regularly reported in its
columns.
The price of the WEEKLY SUN is one
dollar a year for a sheet of eight pages,
and fifty-six columnis. As this barely
pays expense! s of paper and printing, we
are not able to make any discount or al
low anyli pIremnilum to frieinds who may
make special efforts to extend its circula
tion. .Under the new law, which re
quires payment of postage in advance,
one dollar a year, with twenty cents the
cost of plrepaidi postate adiled, is the rate
of subscription. It is not necessary to
get up a club in order to have the Week
ly Sun at this rate. Any one who sends
one dollar and twenty ceots will get the
paper, post-paid, for a year.
We have no traveling agents.
THE WEEKLY. SUN. -Eight pages,
fifty-six columns. Only $1.20 a year,
postage prepaid. No discouut from this
rule.
THE DAILY SUN.--A large four-page
newspaper of twenty-eight columns
Daily circulation over 120000. All the
news for 2 cents. Subscription, postage

THE
People's Vindicator,
FOR 1875.1
We take pleasure in announcing to the
numerous friends of the VINDICTOR,
that we have perfected arrangements for
the continuation of its publication upon
a firm basis. The public are well awuare
of the difficulties under wLich the Con
servativ$ press of Louisiana labor; the
infamous printing law ..ssed by a parti
san Legislature, solely to foster and up
hold, at the expense of the tax-payers,
journals entirely antagonistical to their
interest, and at war upon their libh'rties,
and by forcing, nunder the forms of law,
our citizens to advertise in theae oficial
papers, to break down their power, the
Conservative and Democratic press; con
sequently we are conmpelled to depend
for sluplport upon the generons eontribu
tion of a people already poverty-stricken,
but we feel assured that they w;ll not
fail to sustain their luain i power in tihe
war of virtue against vice
The Fearless White Ilan's Press of
Louislana. -
The future tone of this paper d'an be
judged from its past. We will continue
to advocate to success, the rights of the
TAXED, that honesty and capability,
ALONE, shall constitute grounds for po
litical preferment, and a continued and
nevercessing war upon Kellogg and his
corrupt officials-knowing them to he in
common with their Chief, both usurpers
and thieves.
We can assure the public that we will
not hesitate to attack the acts of any po
litical organization, when we believe
them to be antagonistic to public good.
We are the servant of nbclique or party
and intend solely to protect and defend
thie rights and liberties, in our honest
way, of the iholo people-believing that
we have done stlficient service in the
cause of the PEOPLE in the past, we
confidently expect their support in the
future,

A Reprcsentativo and Champion of American
Art Taste !
r' Frospectus f r 18Th-Eighth Year.
m TRE ALDI f toE,:
TIHE' ART JOURNAL OF AMERICA,
ISSUED. MOYTIILY.
' "A Magnificent Conception, wonderfully
- carried out."
y The necessity of a popular inediun for
e the representatitcn of the productions of
our great artists, has always beenI recog
Snlized, andllt iaaiR attm'lipts have been
' adille to 0li'et, the want. The successive
failures which so invarilhIy followed e,'!ch
II attempt in this country to estahblish an
t, art journal, did not prove the imliifir
t- sIec of the people of Amcerica io thlle
claims of high art. So soon as a proper
II appreciation of the want :rnd an ability
1. to meet it were shown, the public at
- nce rallied with enthusiasm to its sup
'1 port. and the result was a great artistic
a- ami eommer'i:al triumpnlh-T'IE ALDINE.
s THE ALDINE, while issued with all the
I regularity. has none of the temporary or
LI timely interest characteristic of ordinary
peridicals. It is an elegant miscellany
Sofpure, light and graceful literature ; and
', a collection of pictures, the rarest speci
1 mens of artistic skill, in black and white.
Although each succeeding number afftrds
Ia fresh pleasure to its friends, the real
V value and beauty of the API)INNE will be
S most appreciated after it his been hound
Sup at the close of the year. While other
I journals may claim superior cheapness, as
compared with r :als of a similar class,
I the ALDINE is a unique and original con
i ception-alone and nnapproached-also
Intely withouit competition in price or
character. The possessor of a complete
volume cannot duplicate the qunat!ty of
3 fine paper and engravings in any other
shape or nnmberiofvolumes for ten times
its cost; and the)l, there is the Chromno
besides!
National featre'rof TIlE ALI)INE
must be takenl in: no narrow sense. True
art is cosmopolitan. While THE AL
DINE is a strictly American institution,
it does not contfine itself entirely to the
reproduction of native art. Its mission
is to cultivate a brond and a( appreciative
art taste, one that will discriminate only
º on grounds of intrinsic merit. Thus,
while placing before the patrons of TilE
º ALDINE. as a laadling charaeteritie, the
productions of tl1e most noted American
i artists, attention will always be given to
specimens from Foreign mnasters, giving
subscribers all thi pleasure and instruc
tion obtainable firom home or foreign
sources.
The artistic ilistration of American
I scenery, original with THE ALDINE, is
an important fea~ re, and its magnificent
plates are of a si e more appropriate to
the satisfactory treatment of de.tails
than can be afl trded by any inferior
page. The judicious interspersion of
landscape, miarin , figure, and animal
subjects, sustain an nunabated interest,
impossible where the scope of the work
confines the artist too closely to a single
style of suhject. The literature of THE
ALDINE is a lig lt and graceful accom
paniment, worth of the artistic fea
turos, with only stch technical disqrisi
tions as do not interfere with the popu
lar interest of tha work.
Premilmu for 1875.

The Saturday Evening Post. e
The Oldest and Best Story Paper Pub
lished. 1c
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821. f
For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, andti has ever borne aa
widespread and unblemishe~d reputation is
for the unsurpassed purity, refinement ,
and excellence of the Serials, 8ketches n
and Miscellaneous reading matter.
It is pre-eminently tl
The Best Family Paper p
that is paublished in this country, from its c
never containing anything that would sd
offend the feelings of any one, either in L
a religioue or political sense, or that
could not be roadul at any fireside without
objection fromn the most fastidious.
IThe circulation of the Saturtlhy Even
ing Post, through not quite so large 0
perhaps, as its 'onunger contemploraries, li
is not, like that,of some of them, fluetit- il
atiug, and too often short-lived, but ft
SURE, SOLID AND SUBSTANTIAL,
based upon the intrinsic merit of the pa
per itself and not dependent on any ex-.
tranueous influences, such as the polttlari- 0o
ty of individual writers, &c. s
Good, however, as the Saturday Even- oi
ing Post has been in the pasi, it is our C
intention to make it still better in the e
future, and with this object in view we
will etiet a marked improveument in eve
ry department of the paper, anid will
call to our assiitanee writers of admitted
ability and ';nown reputation.
By inereasing its farater attractions,
and adaing many judicious anid Ipleas
Ing lIvelties, by stuidyi'g how to please Y
514 oultivate tbe lopular tasteby in- o
. creasiung industry and enterprise, and by
enlarged facilitiee, we hope to make new
friends with each anml every issne, and
continue to maintain thie claim of the t
Saturday Evening Post to its title of TiE
