Sedge of the ribs, increases on pres

en the left side; sometimes the fasin

for rheumatstsninrrhe eanr.. .Theston
ach is af'ected with
M:A ; tht head it r dw" pate,
accorpanied with a dull, heavy sen
sation in the back part. There is gen
erally a cobsiderable loss of memory,
accompanied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done. A slight,
dry cough is sometimes an attendant.
Thb patient' complains ot, weariness
and debility ; he is essily startled. his
feet ae cold or burning, antd he com
plains of a prickly sensation of the
skin; his spirits are low ; and although
he is satis'ied that exercise would be
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely
summon up fortitude enough to try it.
In fact, he distrusts every remedy.
Several of the above symptoms attend
the disease, but cases have occutred
where few of them existed, yet exam
ination of the body, after deathb, hs
shown the LIVER to have been exten
:&siVely deranged.

The slave Ihmat no reply, but con- .i

"O, PlAot-! -ealled the maiden, tt
''dost thou not think these violet to
clusters handsome?
The wild flowers still engaged the
attention of loPRon.
"PaAos !" Petulantly exclaimed
IcYLwLA, irritated because of his in
attention. "Bring me no more flow
er. my wreath Is complete!"
The slave was still deaf to the voice
of his mistress, and continued gath.
ering and assorting the party color
ed nemns that nature strewed with
lavish profusion on the hillocks
near by.
"Ioraox !"-again called, the vir- Al
gin in a louder tone and tapping the
earth with her dainty little foot.
Now the slave looked up.
His superb mistress was standing
on a little knoll in the simple garb of
a Sheparuess, unadorned save by the
purple floret ornamenting her gentle
buddlong breast. A slight breeze
ruffled a few strands from the falling
masses of her silken curls, and not
withstanding the little angry glance TL
that flashed from beneath the sable
liotels of her deep blue eyes, IOPJON
thought her Incomparable, irresis-=
tably beautiful. Filled with a rap
turous admiration for this supernal
creature-statue.like, he stood spell
bound!
"What ails thee ?" said ICYLLIA in
her musical voice, "Art thou deaf ?
Hast thou eaten of enchanted flow
ore that po!son the senses ? and doet
thou imagine thou art petrifild by
looking at the head of the iedusa e
Speak good PnAoN, what ails thee ?
And why standest thou so still and
with thy fixed orbs so rudely gaze t
upon me!"
The slave smiled mournfully.
"lister," said he, "I am like the
dying gazelle, that sees and hears t
the gurgling drops of alimpd stream n
flow by, yet hath not strength to
reach the waters4t craves to quentch
ts larchd thirst"
"Pray tell me," said the. tender
hearted maiden, "for what thirateth
