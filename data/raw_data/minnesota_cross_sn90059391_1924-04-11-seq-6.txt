PAGE SIX
WOMEN, OLD AND NEW
THE line of demarcation between
the old woman and the new, can
not be set at any one period in
the history of civilized mankind. It
runs through all ages in all countries.
It is our purpose then to discuss some
of the characteristic of the old wom
an, of all time. We can not put one
group of women together and label
them as “old;” nor on the other hand
can we mark another portion of the
female population a being that por
tion which in itself constitutes the
“new.” The difference varies as do
individuals. The distinction is more
or lees arbitrary.
In the United States for the past
hundred years, ever since the prin
ciples of the feminist movement be
gan to take root .there have been
women, who being different in their
ideas and modes of life from the ma
jority of women, were called “new
women.” Many claim, that since
women have received the vote and
political and legal status equal with
men, the day of the new woman has
arrived. They infer that now the
majority of women in this country
can be classed as “new women.”
Egypt, on the other hand, has few
women who can be justly described
as new women. At least that appe
lation would not apply to them in
the American sense. In that coun
try, the condition of the majority of
women has not changed or progressed
since the time of Pharaoh Tut-Ank
hamen, thirtv-four centuries ago.
Grace Thompson Seton, writing
some time ago in The Century Maga
zine gave a powerful pen picture of
the life of the average Egyptian
woman. They toil long hours in the
fields, work in drudgery, amid the
most squalid surroundings in their
mud houses —in short, they do the
same a their ancestors did fourteen
hundred years before the time of
Christ.
Mrs. Seton pictures one extreme in
her remarkable article. The women
of whom she relates probably repre
sent the lowest development to be
found in any so-called civilized
country. The other extreme, and I
often wonder which of the two is the
more desirable, is found in the Unit
ed States and in western Europe. I
refer to the flapper, as she is known
in our country, or the garconne, as
she is called in France. Here is the
ultra modern, pleasure seeking, jazz
loving woman, a product of our “high
“higer” civilization.
A flapper, in the most widely ac
cepted sense of the word, is a young
Woman, whose interests center no
where, who is jumping from one fad
to the next, to occupy her shallow
mind. She is one whose power of
reasoning and logic changes like the
cameleon, and whose horse sense has
long since galloped away. But then,
following that definition, flappers are
not always young women.
That is why a doubt arises as to
whether the condition of the burden
ed woman of Egypt is not just as
desirable as that of the ultra-mod
ern young American. The former has
much, I believe, that can be said in
her favor.
But betwen those two extremes, we
find in most countries, and especial
ly in English-speaking nations, a
medium type. A woman who repre
sents modern life, whose ideals are

progressive, yet conseivative, whose
interests center in the community in
which she lives, in her home, and if
she is married, in her family. It is
this type, whom many would dub as
“old.” that I wish to defend against
both the extreme types above out
lined.
Zane Gale, author of the novel,
“Miss Lulu Bett,” with which we are
all acquainted, has written a new,
and in many ways stronger novel, en
titled. “Faint Perfume.” Leda Perrin,
the principal character in the story,
is the type of woman I have in mind.
She is a writer and returns to her
home in a small town to take a nec
essary rest. Her father, a minister,
dies shortly after Leda’s return, and
she is forced because of her economic
condition, to make her home with her
cousins. Mrs. Truman Crumb, head
of the household into which
comes to live, and her two daughters.
Tweet and Pearl, represent a type of
woman, who is more shallow and
finicky than old fashioned in the
sense we are here employing it. They
live in a narrow world of small inci
dents and affairs. They have no out
look on life, while Leda sees things
through broad vistas. Naturally
there is a mental conflict. Although
Pearl Crumb, who marries an English
writer, Barnaby Powers, has traveled
much during the nine years of her
wedded life, she still clings to the
harrassed point of view of the
Crumbs. In fact, she finds her way
of thinking (if we may call it that)
so incompatible with that of her
husband, that she obtains a divorce.
Leda has many interests in common
with the writer, Powers, and therein
is the cog upon which the main
theme of the plot revolves. Incident
but must have born with her some
the plot one that will provoke
thought on the part of the reader.
This story demonstrates to us that
the ideal modern woman is not made
by education and experience alone,
but most have born with her some
fertile ground upon w'hich the re
sults of education and experience can
grow and develop.
In seeking after self advancement
and pleasure alone, many modern
women have lost the feminine charm
which is so essential a part of the
character and make-up of the more
stable “old” woman.
R. LeClerc Phillips, writing on
"The Decline of Feminine Charm,”
in the New York Times Magazine, re
cently said: “We have the movie type
of feminine beauty, lacking in either
distinction or individuality, gushing,
inane and democratically common
place. a type that is being persistent
ly copied’ by the large majority ot
young women, who aspire to a ‘good
time’ by either the ‘ingenue’ or
‘vamp’ style, according to taste; and
finally we have as representatives
and custodians of feminine charm,
our flappers.”
Dr. Emile Reich, in his book,
“Women Through the Ages,” takes a
decidedly hostile thrust at the new
womaq, when he contends that in
spite of all the schools, seminaries
and universities for women in this
country, and in spite of all the ma
gazines and publications put out for
women alone, nothing of lasting val
ue has been produced by them. He
says: “* * woman has in America,
done none of those remarkable deeds
of a literary, scientific or artistic
character for which the Somervilles,
Fawcetts, Brontes, George Eliots and
George Sands and others are famous
in Europe.” But that is a Europe of
one hundrel years ago and more, to
which the doctor refers and the same
conditions that are found in Ameri
ca, will be found in Europe, but to
a more noticeable degree.
In an indirect way, Warner Fabian,
the novelist, takes his stand for the
woman whose life does not touch,
or even border upon the extreme
standards of the day. He does this in
his book, “Flaming Youth,” in which
the new woman is shown as “discon
tented, craving sensation, following
blind instincts, neurotic, exotic,
erotic and seductive,” in such a way
as to almost disgust the reader. And
one can not truthfully say that his
lines are overdrawn.
A business life, it has been pointed
out, is responsible for much of the
decline of charm in the modern wom
an. My contention is, that a woman
can have a career in business or a
profession and still maintain that
charm which is so essential to her, if
she has had the proper start in life.
By that, I mean the right home
training, and the care of a mother
who can impart to her daughter the
best in her own life.
“To be a woman is a whole-time
job,” once wrote W. L. George, the
English novelist and feminist. 1
would modify that assertion by say
ing that, “to be an all-round woman,
possessing a progressive outlook and
the essential qualities of a lady, is a
whole-time job.”
The same authority said of the new
woman that she is “as unconvential
KUUTS DEMANDS ARE
ENACTED INTO LAWS
South Carolina General Assem
bly Takes Favorable Action
oa Many Points
COLUMBIA. S. C.. April 5.
While the Ku Klux Klan was not
mentioned in the debates in either
house of the general assembly which
has just closed its session here, some
of the things demanded by the Klan
were placed upon the statute law of
the state.
The outstanding legislation, per
haps, this year, was that relating to
the public schools. Provision was
made for giving every child in the
state a school term of as least Beven
months. While the cities and larger
towns and a few of the rural com
munities have had a nine months
school for years, many of the rural
communities have been sadly neg
lected.
Several months ago the Grand Dra
gon of the state, in an official pro
clamation to local Klans called upon
the entire membership to call upon
the members of the legislature that
something be done for the improve
ment of the common schools. He de
manded no half way measures, but
insisted that real constructive work
be done, and the legislation that has
followed is almost revolutionary in
its character. The school appropria
tion has been greatly increased, of
course, but nobody is complaining
about that. There has been no in
crease in the tax rate, as additional
revenues were secured by the im
position of certain forms of special
license taxes, occupational taxes,
etc.
The victory in school legislation is
regarded as a great achievement for
the Klan.
in logic as she is in other things.”
“We are all modest when the fas
hions are,” a new women is represent
ed as telling Mr. George. She also
adds that "we’re neither devils nor
angels, but something in between.”
In a book entitled, “La Garconne.”
by Victor Margueiite, which has set
ail literary France “on edge” the ac
tions of the French flapper are dealt
with. The book has caused such a
furore, so out-spoken of the modern
woman are its paces, that the order
of the Legion of Honor, has been
withdrawn from its author, who held
it for previous meritorious work. The
book must indeed be most bizarre to
create such a commotion in France,
which has rightly or wrongly gained
the reputation of a nation that de
lights in pieces of literary scandal.
Nevertheless, a truth is brought out
that can not be denied. Monique,
who is the heroine in the story, en
lightened and untrammeled as she is
said to be, differs in ideals and man
ners from the young girls with old
fashioned notions of the pre-war
days, but is identical with her in in
stinct.
Marguerite sounds the note of the
eternal feminine in this book. The
difference between the old woman
and the new is then, one of ideals
and modes, and not a permanent
quality.
Beneath the surface there are the
same qualities in the Egyptian peas
ant woman as are to be found in the
American flapper. There can be new
women in Egypt, as is shown by the
party of devotees gathered about Ma
dame Zaad Zadhlul Pasha, forming
the ladies delegation for the Inde
pendence of Egypt. On the other
hand there can be persons in this
country today holding bolshevistic
views on things feminine, like the
doctor, who in a recent letter to an
Ohio newspaper, urged young women
not to marry and form homes of their
own, but to lead their own indepen
dent lives as long as they could.
In summing up, I like the paradox
written by W. L. George, in which he
says: "But woman, in spite of her
newness, remains as old as ever she
was.”

ARE ALIENS A MENACE
TO AMERICA?
The Christian Science Monitor
Activity by racial groups in the
United States declared to be working
to bring about the defeat of the
Johnson bill now before congress, or
any legislation proposing the restric
tion of alien immigration, has served
to direct public attention to the ne
cessity of formulating and adopting
a definite immigration policy. The
conviction has been impressed that
those composing these groups are not
acting as American citizens, but as
aliens who are more loyal to the
countries of their origin than to the
country of their partial adroption.
Under existing political, industrial
and social conditions in the United
States, these advocates of unrestrict
ed immigration prove unconvincing
advocates of such a cause. They
themselves are supplying the absolute
proof of the necessity of adopting ef
fective restrictive legislation.
The American Legion, through its
commander. James R. Quinn, has
joined hands with the American Fed
eration of Labor, represented by Sam
uel Gompers, in an effort to direct
the attention of the people of the
United States to the importance of
viewing the problem presented in the
light of reason and without false
sentimentality. They do not blame
the discontented and discouraged peo
ples of southern European countries
for seeking asylum elsewhere. But
they do hold responsible for the con
ditions which preclude their admis
sion to the United States at this time,
or at any time in the near future, the
failure or refusal of their compatri
ots who now live under the protec
tion of American laws to assume the
duties and responsibilities of citizen
ship.
It is pointed out that during the
last century some 30,000,000 aliens
have entered the United States. They
are now, at least nominally, an inte
gral part of the nation. But the facts
disclosed show that instead of becom
ing a part of the whole, millions of
these newcomers are still the nation
als, at least in sympathy and preju
dices, of the lands from which they
came. The melting pot, whose effi
ciency as a transmuter of human
dross into the pure gold of patriot
ism and love of country has been
boasted, seems to have failed to per
form its functions. For this failure
it may be claimed that Americans
themselves are in no small part re
sponsible. But if the fact remains
that the fusing process has not been
accomplished, and that there exists a
menacing and increasingly large fac
tor still to be reclaimed, it does not
so much matter who is blamable.
Commander Quinn quite naturally
began his study of the immigration
problem, just as Mr. Gompers has
pursued it, in an effort to determine
the economic effects of restricted im
migration, and the possible effects of
the adoption of an absolute prohib
itive policy. He was concerned, first
of all, for the 4.600,000 Americans
who were in the military service dur
ing the war. A great majority of
these, he found, were men who
worked with their hands for a living.
Unrestricted immigration threatened
to make impossible the reintroduc
tion of these workers into the indus
trial scheme of the country. But his
research seems to have led him much
farther than this. The economic as
pect of the case loses its importance
as the social and political factors be
come emphasized. Exploited by as
tute nationals who have preyed upon
them, as well as by employers in in
dustry who have compelled them to
work for less than a fair living wage,
the more ignorant immigrants have
grown bitter and resentful, offering
a fertile field for the seeds of radi
calism and revolution.
What is to be the method by which
this problem is solved? It is con
tended that until a plan can be
evolved which will insure protection
to the immigrant, and which at the
same time will protect American cit
izens and American institutions, there
must be a complete cessation of im
migration. The existing method of
fixing quotas based on the number
of aliens resident in the United
States at some • previous period,
while somewhat more satisfactory
than some other methods attempted
<»r proposed, probably will never es
tablish the true basis. If immigrants
in any number are to be admitted
they must be educated. This educa
tion should accomplish their Ameri
canization, at least in the sense that
it will teach them patriotism and
obedience to the laws. With this as
sured, there would, perhaps. be no
immigration problem.
WIIILD DAVE CATHOLIC
FOR 0. S. PRESIDENT
Religious Publication Would Like
to See Argument Tried
Out in Nation
(Korean of rnbltcatton and Kdurntion)
WASHINGTON, D. C.. March 31.
The Catholic Citizen is becoming bold
in its enthusiasm for its own cause,
and says: “It is the ‘defeatist’ ele
ment among Catholics who echo the
notioh that no Catholic can be elect
ed president of the United States. It
is the grafter type, the corner gro
cery prophet, the habitual down-and
outer cynic who supports this shabby
notion. Let us help nominate some
body and try the issue out.”
The Catholic organ is chosen be
cause some Catholics have gotten in
to office. It harps a good deal about
Governor-Alfred Smith, of New York,
being a Catholic and getting elected
to office. Here is some more of its
reasoning:
“Senator Walsh, of Montana, has
twice been elected United States
senator. A few years ago it was said
that no Catholic could be elected
United States senator. Now we have
several Catholics in the senate. In
1880, most of the New York dailies
said that no Catholic could be elect
ed Mayor of New York, And it would
weaken Hancock’s chances to carry
New York if Grace was nominated for
mayor. Grace was elected but Han
cock was not.”
The nearest the Catholics ever
came to having one of their faith in
the White House was when President
Wilson was sick abed and Joe Tumul
ty ran things around the executive
offices. And there is no question
about it. he ran things, too.
If the Catholic Citizen is so boast
ful about this proposition, let the
Catholics try to persuade the demo
crats to nominate A 1 Smith and try
out the issue as it says.
And then people ask the question

Plot to Destroy
Public Schools
Enemies of public schools, operat
ing mysteriously in a deep-laid plot,
have wrought consternation among
school officials and the public gener
ally in a cluster of towns in northern
California by the burning of five
school buildings and the attempted
destruction by fire and dynamite in
two others within the past two
month.
Schools at Santa Rosa and three
other northern California cities are
now under guard, while a determined
effort is being made by school author
ities, police and fire underwriting
companies to bring the incendiaries
to justice.
Oakland, Calforinia, recently lost
a SIOO,OOO school. A few nights pre
viously a school building in Alameda,
a suburb of Oakland, was razed by
fire.
One of the public school buildings
in Santaa Rosa was burned to the
ground a few weeks ago, about the
same time that the Freemont gram
mar school narrowly escaped destruc
tion, the principal having been given
warning by an unidentified man.
A $50,000 building also went up in
smoke at Esparto, and Woodland re
cently lost a new high school valued
at $300,000.
An attempt was made to burn the
grammar scnool at Lincoln, where
charred, oily rags were found in the
building. In Anderson, somewhat fur
ther north, a cache of dynamite was
discovered near the high school build
ing.
All these towns are clustered just
north and east of San Francisco, and
the burning of so many public school
buildings so close together within so
short a time by incendiaries indicates
a well laid plot by enemies of Ameri
canism and the public school system
to destroy completely America’s dem
ocratic means of education in that
section.
The value of the property thus far
destroyed is estimated at more than
Tie-half a million dollars. Authori
ties are taking every precaution to
stop further destruction.
Anti-Klan Candidates
on Fairmont Tickets
FAIRMONT, W. VA„ April 7.-That
Frank R. Amos, prosecuting attorney
for Marion county, will be a candi
daate for re-election, is the substance
of a story going the rounds in political
circles here. Amos, it will be re
called, has repeatedly announced that
the Ku Klux Klan is a “lawless ele
ment.” It is not known whether or
not he will run on an anti-Klan plat
form. Marion county is said to be
one of the strongest Klan counties in
West Virginia.
Rumor also has it that Judge Em
met M. Showalter, judge of tne Ma
rion county criminal court, who re
cently became notorious on account
of his attacks on the Klan, will be a
candidate for re-election. Although
Judge Showalter has not publicly an
nounced his candidacy, dopesters de
clare that the announcement is immi
nent. Any good American who can’t
get a good hearty laugh out of that
ought to see a chiropractor, local
Amercan voters say.
In 1910, when the World’s Mission
ary conference adjourned in Edin
burgh, it was planned that another
such gathering would take place in
1920. The war prevented the carry
ing out of this plan. Rut, however,
the Foreign Missions conference of
North America has planned its North
American missionary conference in
1926 which, in the scope of its pro
gram, will be, perhaps, one of the
greatest religious gatherings ever
held.

INCAS WIPEI OUT
FOR THEIR GOLD
Used Precious Metal Erea For
Cooking Utensils—Were
Great Runners
When the Spaniards first came to
the highlands of South America, they
found many strange things being
done by the couple of million inhab
itants who lived all the way from
what is now Ecuador to the northern'
part of Chile, says Adventure.
These people smelted copper, wove
cloth, built houses or neavy masonry,
embalmed dead bodies and used gold
for household cooking, eating and
drinking vessels. This last was their
undoing, for while they put avalue
on gold only as something to use like
any other metal, the Spaniards prized
it as we do, and went crazy over it.
These people had a large sheep
they used for packing; but it was too
small for a riding animal, and not
very swift, so all the swift errand*-
were performed by runners. It is
said that the Inca king each day ate
fresh fish caught from the sea and
hurried to him by relays of fast run
ners.
Wonderful Runners
Incredible records were made by
these men, who had been trained
from birth, almost, to run. The high
altitude developes huge lung power,
after generations have been bred irr
it, but for you and me it makes for
short windedness. But the people*
who are born and brought up in the
ran tied air are short and stocky and
with very large lungs. They lived ii>
a country ranging from 10,000 to 14,-
000 feet high, with mountains run
ning up at intervals to over 22,000
feet.
All were —and are yet —inveterate
users of cocoa. This is leaves from
the tree of the plant from which co
caine is extracted. For long feats of
endurance they took a small pack
age of these leaves and constantly
kept a wad of them in their mouths
wrapped around a small bit of un
slaked lime to free the cocaine and
other alkaloids contained in the coco*
leaves.
Increases Endurance
One American doctor w r ho investi
gated the subject and wrote a large
book on it, and a famous American
writer (Dr. Mozans), claim that co
caine used in this fashion appears ter
free great reserves of strength, and
is not attended with the pernicious
results following the use of the drug
cocaine, which has not the balancing
chemicals found in the entire leaf.
Be that as it may, the Indian runners
and packers used and still use this
leaf when on their long jaunts.
