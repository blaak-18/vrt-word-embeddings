T White Supremacy.
The Democratic press has en
(leavored to make the people be
lieve that white supremacy was at
issue in this campaign, notwith
standing the fact that the Popu
list tickets everywhere are made
or. up of white men thoroughly iden
er. tified with their constituency.
Said press has repeatedly tried
to prove that our State ticket was
4o depending almost entirely upon
the negro for its election, and was
therefore pandering to the colored
manl in his supposed desire for of
fleice and for equality with the white
a people.
00 But row comes the Times-Demno
00 crat and reports Capt, Pharr's
0 speech-correctly too-made to
over 3000 negroes.
Pr Bead this speech and see if bet
Ster advice could be given the ne
gro, or if such advice will lead to
per negro domination, or if a Democrat
b. was ever known to give expression
m. to such sentiments lefore a color
b' ed audience:
M: Mr. Pharr spoke in a calm and
" deliberate manner, but did not inm
' press his hearers as favorably as
anticipated. He said that he had
been accused of being a goldbug,
but this was untrue, but if any
one would furnish the gold he ]
could put it to good use. He
would accept all the silver that
could be given him; would make
good use of it and "not term it a
base metal. He advised the ne
groes not to endeavor to control
political affairs, stating that the
white man had ruled iin all coun
tries and would continue to do so.
'You must adopt their virtue,"
be amid. "You have enough baId
traits of your own. It is useless
for the negro to hope that he will
ever rule this country. The white
man is your superior and you must t
be educated by him. We, the,
white men ot the Btate, recognize
your worth as laborers. We w r.t
you here; we can't do without you ;
but, you can never hope to occupy
the first positions and rule in this a
land."
He had plowed beside the black '
brother, and had picked cotton t
with him, and the sweat of his c
brow and association had attract- I
ed his respect for the coloredc man.
He stated that 'he had been accus- r
ed of advising the negroes to go
armed to the polls. This was un.- i
tree. What he had said was for t
r, the negroes to go the polls, vote
and go home. They were snpport-.
ed in this campaign by good and 1
true white men, who would remain (
at the polls and see that their votes a
-were counted. He had never and ,
never would advise the negroes to a
precipitate a confliet with the a
whites. They mast be peaceable, f,
cultivate intelligence, patience and i
forbearenee, and hope through them t
to rise to the position of laving ,
their rights of iseedom recogazed f
and their vetes honestly counted.
He advised the sppport or the
perish ticket beaded by Hon.
John D. Fliber for 8tate Senator, c
stating that tei men composing
this ticket had pledged themselves
to use every endeavor to see a fair
cut.

e Whereas, wholesale frauds in

this parish by leaving the names

it W. O. Breazeale, and his Clerk,

o "I am aware that you are the
nominee of the )cemocratic party
as its candidate forGovernor. \Weo
are opposing candidates for the
c same oflie. You being the in
cumnint of that office at this time,
it is your duty, through oflicers
appointed by you, to conduct the
ele:tion. It is your sa0rn duty,
y throuirh the ollicers appointed Iby
you, to condluct the election accord
ing to law, and to see that a fair
s and free election is heldl, at which
all of the legal voters are permit
ted to be registered anti to vote as
they prefer, and it is your sworn
duty to see to it that the votes so
east are honestly counted and hon
estly returned as cast for the dif
ferent candidates.
"I have to intorm you that your
registrars of voters in many par
ishes of the State, notably in St.
Landry, Jefferson andi Plalque
mines, are using their power not
to register the qualifiwed voters, but
to delay, hinder and prevent hun
dreds, if not thousands, of legal
voters from being registered.
"The law provrdes that when
necessary the registrar shall have
appointed a clerk to assist him in
the work of registration, and that
said clerk shall be of the 'opposing
political party,' and that the Gov
ernor shall appoint the clerk.
"It is a fact notorious, which
must be known to you, that every
registrar and every clerk of regis
tration are members of your own
party.
"It is your duty to appoint one
superviser of election for each par
ish, except Orleans, and it is the
duty of the police jury in each par
ish, all of whom are your appoint
ees, to appoint another supervisor,
who with the one appointed by the t
clerk of court, shall select the com
missioners of election and fix the
polling places. The clerks of court,
with the fewest exceptions, are al- t
so members of your party. So
the organizations nominating me
as their candidate have no repre
sentative either at the registration
of voters or in fixing the polling
places, or in the officers appointed
to return the votes.
"Your own sense of duty as at
sworn officer, your own sense of
honor as a man and a citizen, must
revolt at such unfairness and in
justice, which, if not remedied,
will make the coming election a
farce, if not a tragedy, and bring
reproach upon the State and black
en your amune forever. You can
not afford to take the government
another four years by force and
fraud, and I now give you notice
that come what may, I will resist
it withallthe power I can com- t
mand.
"The premises consicd~red, I here
formerly but respectfully demand:
"1. That you remove all clerks
of registration and appoint in their
places men selected by my politi
cal amociates as clerks.
"2. That you require your reg
istrars of voters to afford every L
facility for all of the legal voters
to register. n
"8. That you require the lec
tion supervisors appointed by you,
sad the police juries appointed by it
you, to ix the polling plaees so
that all the voters ean, without ia- d
6venisene, vote.
"4. That you require said so
pervaors to appoint one commis
sioner of election at each box and
eaeh poll, etected by my political k
ausociates.
"5. That ymou require all elec
tio doers to permit ome man, to t
be aeleted by my politieal am
ates, to be present as a watober ul
ateach boxaad each poll on the a
day of eledatio.

The White Election Proposi
tion.
The Enterprise has had a great
(deal to say about the white cloc
e tion proposition, and is trying to
make campaign capital out of it,
so I shall write a complete histo
ry of the affair, and my connec
tion with it, and let the public
decide,
e Some time ago Mr. P. P. Brea
zeale, Democratic candidate for
District Attorney, and member of
campaign committee of this par
ish, Mr. Henry Hughes, member
of Democratic Executive Commit
tee, and I think Dr. J. W. Cocker
ham, (Mr. Breazeale says it was
tMr. J. Alphonse Prudhomme) and
myself were standing upon Front
street in the city of Natchitoches,
Messrs. B. and 11. and myself were
r talking about the white primary
offered by the Populist party. Mr.
B. was accusing the Populist of
wanting the colored votes, and I
was accusing the Democratic party
of wanting the colored votes, and
we were, of course, both denying
- that our party wanted the negro.
Mr. B. asked me why did I re
fuse to have a white election offer
ed by the Democratic party. 1 de
nied that they had ever offered it,
and claimed our party stood ready
to let the white people decide in
this parish. About this time Mr.
D. C. Scarborough, a prominent
Democrat and a sincere white su
premist, who had come up a few
minutes before, said: "What are
you boys bluffing about, if you all
want a white election, let us have
it, now let us go and enter into an
agreement, and the man that backs
down let him shut up." These
were about his words. We three
(Iessrs. B. aln S. and myself)
then went Mr. B's. office and there
the following agreement was writ
ten
ASreeme No. I.
We the undersigned hereby en
ter into the following agreement:
First--The Democratic and Pop
ulist party are to have equal rep
resentation at the polling precincts
in the Parish of Natchitoches, and
each party is to have the right to
name it. Commissioners.
Second-All white men that can I
prove to the Commissioners that
they' are legal voters, will be al
lowed to vote, whether or not
their names can be found on the
poll-list.
