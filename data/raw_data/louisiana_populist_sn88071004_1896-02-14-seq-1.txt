PATERNALISM.
THE GOVERNMENT PATERNAL
ISTIC TO SOLDIERS.
Giving to Trusts. Banks. Uyadleates and
Corporations the Rankest Liad of
Paternalism and Daagess to the P.e
ples' Liberties.
The Helena, Montana, News.
Cleveland in his message says he is
opposed to paternalism. He seems to
think that the principals of paternalism
should not be introduced into govern
ment. It is true that he does not define
paternalism, and we are somewhat at
a loss to know wEat he means, but it id
evident that he thinks the governmer.t
should do nothing for the people that
they can do for themselves. Our idea
of government is quite different. Gov
ernment is for the benefit of the peo
ple, sad when government ean do any
thing for the piople better than the
people can do for themselves, the peo
Ple ought to have the government do it.
For lnstancee, the government carries the
mail for the people; it does it far bet
ter than private Individuals or corpora
tions could possibly do. The same can
be said of thy public schools; the state
is educating the youth better than their
parents could, that is,,more people are
learning to read and cypher than would
be possible under any other system.
Now, if the government can earry our
malls so successfully, why cannot it
carry our freights? Is there any dif
ference in principle between carrying
a letter and carrying a heavier pack
age? It the government can conduct
our postoees so satisfactory, why can
not it conduct our telegraph ofbes as
satisfactory to the people? And why
not our telephone lines? We pay mil
lions every year for freight, for tele
grams and for telephone service more
than it ought to cost us. At the same
time we are building up colousal for
tunes which are used to control politi
cal parties and corrupt the people, that
the fellows mey continue their plunder
lag methods. Il t not time the people
were takcag thought to stop these meth
ods tha have enabled the plutoerats to
pleade thiem t eoum the pautocrats'
will oppose any sek ioye. It is to,'
their Interest to ppos everything of

But the government does other acts
of paternalism. Each senator and mem
ber of congress gets $125 a year in ad
dition to his salary for stationery, etc.
Many of them draw this allowar.e in
money and then bunco the governieent
out of the stationery they use by stu..l
ing from the allowance made to com
*' mittees, and in other "ways that are
o- dark." Both the senate and the house
of representatives have stores where
members can purchase stationery and
almost everything else. After exhaust
in ing their $125 allowance they get as
much more as they please, and it is
to taken out of their salaries when final
m settlement is made. Why should the
1- congress provide stores where congress
th men can purchase at cost what they
need, and refuse the same privile, to
is other office-holders and ordinary . ti
st sens? Can the opponents of paternal
tt ism tell us? No; and no one will at
a tempt the task; but they will yell loud
and long against paternalism, just tho
same. If all had the same privilege,
- then the privilege which the army and
Le congressmen enjoy would not be a
privilege, and there would be
t. '"Naething to ken them by
.e Fra ony unregenerate heathen
Like you and I."
Paternalism! Paternalism!! Paternal
a lm!!! is yelled and yelled until our
e ears are deafened, when the people
r wapt the government to help them; but
e when It is helping the office-holder, or
d the army olcer, or the contractor, or
worse still, the banker, bondholder and
r all-around thief, then the men who do
t the yelling are as mum as oysters. It
is time the people were to do a little
I yelling for themselves.
t GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP.
Tbh S.tat of the P]eople the Supreme
Law.
American Law Review: Freights and
fares on the governmeur road would be
regulated so as to pay a reasonable
profit upon its actual value, and a cor
- responding reduction ai other transcon
tinental roads would necesnarily re
ault. The rights of thb government and
the public generally would be secured,
and an enormous In tabus would be lift
ed from the people of the west. Im
aglnation can hardly realize the extent
of the relief that would thus be afford
ed to the hard worknmg and poverty op
pressed farmers of the territorial divi
alern of the eountry, and to the people
generally.
In the history of the human race but
one statesman, in a position of author
Ity, great enough to rise above the im
moderate prejudices by which the inter
ests of wealth and capital are but
treesed, has ever appeared. His policy,
though in eosdiet with what are called
sound financial principles, in fact res
cued Athens from the throes of impend
lng dlushstlea, and inaugurated the
most happy aend glorious part of her
history. It has been approved by all
historians; and by the Athenians them
elves it was justly regarded as the
cause of their subsequent prosperity,
and Its adoption under the name of the
gremt Silmetheira (or "shaking of tt
trs') was ever afterwards commnm
orated as a great naalvelrary. The les
soa that t teaches s that the msaty
of th posple is the supreme law (dales
I P8all, Suprema Le); and that, what
ever views we may entertain as to the

The last day of his term of omce
Governor Brown of Kentucky pardoned
It . G. Garden of Louisville, who was
sentenced two years to serve a term of
eight years for manslaughter. For some
time Garden had been employed as a
S"trusty" at the executive mansion,
doing chores and running errands. The
t governor's dog, a fine-looking specimen
- of the shepherd breed, is a family pet,
- and is unusually intelligent. It was
- part of Garden's duty to look after the
- animal, and they came to be fast
friends. When the prison doors were
1 opened in the morning the collie was
there to greet his convict friend and ac
company him to the mansion. At night
he returned with his striped playmate
r to the grim portals. When the pardon
I wa made out last Tuesday the paper
was enclosed in a stout envelope and
given to the animal, which was told to
go to the penitentiary. With a wag
of its tail It left the mansion and ran
down the old aceuatomed route to the ,
prison. A telephone message apprised
the guards of his coming, and he was
admitted without delay. Garden was in
the yard patiently awaiting the arrival
of the governor's messengqr, ever I
Screaming that the dog had been select- 1
ed. Catching sight of the well-known
1 face, the deg ran up to the convict and
laid the envelope at his feet. The glad t
cry of happy surprise that the overjoyed E
prisoner gave vest to on catching up I
the oenial envelope and tearing it open I
was re-echoed by a succession of joyes ,c
barks from the four-footed harbinger of l
the good tidings. A moment later man t
and dog were running at full speed to
ward the governor's oPce to turn the
release over to the warden. The seeie
was witnessed by fifty or more convicts,
who qulfly realied the good fortune a
that had eoae to their fellw prisoner. a

Asse the~ set letter a th 1eig tu
cry, where an autopsy wa- held. To
keen out the prying eyes of observers,
the carpets were torp up and hung at
S the windows. Then the cooking uten
sils were used to eeu" in various por
tions of the bodies as they were dis.
sected, and the blood was spilled all
over the furniture, hangings and car
pets indiscriminately. Much of the fur
'- niture was ruined. But the worst was
to come. Time and money cleaned up
the cottage, but nothing coulld drive
e away the disembodied spirits of the un
fortunate young men, as for some rea
son they took a fancy to the Emery cot
tage. Several parties of young people
rented it. but after remaining there a
night or two they decamped. Ugly sto
ries got afloat. Mischievous boys nailed
such signs as "Spooks to let," "Ghosts
t for sale"and"The Morgue" to the prem
ises. Finally Mr. Emery himself moved
in, but his family did not care to remain
d any longer than the others. Just what
happened nobody cares to tell, but there
are whispers of groans, blows, the
splashing of water and blood-curdling
screams that are loudest on windy
nights. However foolish such stories
sound, they are believed by hundreds
in and about Sodus Point, and the cot
d tage is rendered worse than useless by
them. Mr. Emery has asked the boa
of supervisors of Wayne county, N. Y.,
to pay $187 for damages done by the
coroner, which amount, he says, is
merely nominal.
Cast His Breasl on the Water.
New York special: About four years
ago Henry Lewis, a confectioner, who
t lives with his wife and six children at
52 Floyd street Brooklyn, found an
aged woman sitting on the stoop of his
house. She was poorly dressed and evi
dently without funds. As she showed
evidences of culture, he invited her to
I his home. She accepted, and Mrs. Lewis
refused to let her go. The aged visitor
remalnnd with them until six months
Sago, when Lewis found it a difficult
matter to support his family. Then she
told him she would not contiue to be a
burden on them, and insisted on going
to the poorhouse at Flatbush, where
she remained until a few weeks ago,
when she returned. She had gone away
comparatively a pauper, but returned
worth $300,000, which she has turned
over to Lewis for his kindness in tak
Inb her In and caring for her when she
was without a friend. The discovery
that she was heir to the money was
made when the surrogate of San Fran
elco inquired for her through the
Brooklyn surrogate, and it was discov
ered that she was an inmate of the
poorhouse.
Revival in Prison.
Warden Harley, of the Indiana state
t prison, tells of a remarkable religious
revival in progress in the penitentiary.
Since the wave of religious excitement
struck the prison more than 100 of the
most hardened convicts have professed
conversion. A Christian Endeavor So
Slety, with 200 members, has been or
ganlzed within the prison walls. The
warden says the convicts who are at
the head of the society are wondering
it the seciety wWl be entitled to dele
gates in the next national convention of
the Young People's Society of Christian
Endeavor. Various religious forms have
been introduced in the prison. Those I
convicts whose consciences tell them !
they ought to be baptised are taken to
the bath room, where, with solemn cer
emony, they are baptized in a bath tub.
The warden says there has been a great
improvement In the conduct of the 90t
convicts since the religious wave took
hold ea the prisont. He is encouraging
the chaplain and convicts in the move
sent.

agood one to place it with. '"What
is his age?" was asked the lady. "He
is 70 years old." "Has he ever had
any life insurance?" "No no, indeed.
He never had any life insurance be

had better get his life insured before it I
