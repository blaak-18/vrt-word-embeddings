thing else. These were her words: ‘ln
all my life since I left home, when I
worked and afterward, you are the
only real man and Christian I ever
met, and when I find you, you are
such a goose!’ ”
The boy stopped. His voice had
broken. He stood with clenched hands
before his father’s desk, behind which
the elder Deering sat, his head held
up by conscious effort, his lips caught
between his teeth.
“But you don’t know!” exclaimed
the boy, the words rushing forth again.
“You don’t know how lonely she is
and poor and terribly, terribly out of
the place where she belongs. It was
awful. And even then when I offered
her everything, she tried to send me
away—she tried —oh, Dad! —she tried
to kill herself. She loved me! Can’t
you see? She knew I had money and
everything, too. I told her. She
knew. But I’d lied to her about my
name. I just met her by chance at
first and I was afraid. Don’t you un
derstand, I had lied to her —lied to
her like a cur —to her who wouldn’t
marry me —who wouldn’t marry me
because she loved me too well.”
“iShe wouldn’t marry you?” said
the older man, clawing at his desk top.
“Then—”
“Wait,” cried the son. “It was
that lie. I believe it. Money and po
sition didn’t tempt her. She was too
noble. But when that lie was wiped
away —oh! it was different! I told
everything, my name and who I was.
And then she prayed to know what to
do. I overheard her praying, I tell
you! And I think something none of
us know must have spoken to her. For
she said ‘Yes.’ And, Dad, we were
married yesterday! ’ ’
The elder Deering pressed both of
Ips hands upon his chest and his head
bent forward as if his neck had lost
its power. Walking to the door the
young man flung it open. With a look
of the utmost respect he said, ‘ ‘ Elaine,
dear,” and she came in.
She had changed, of course. A dull
ness had settled all over 'her. There
were puffs of skin beneath her eyes.
On the whole she was not at all the
same.
But when Deering raised his eyes,
he cried out, in instant recognition,
‘ ‘ The red-brown hair! ”
“Yes, sir,” said Elaine in a thick
voice. “I was one of the profits of
the business. And now,” her voice
had become seemingly gay, “I’m back
in the store!” —American Magazine.

THE CHEAT OF OVERCAPI
TALIZATION.
(Continued from Page Three.)
an independent railroad to tidewater.
But the project failed.
Still the independents were dis
satisfied with freight rates. Pres
ently, led by the Pennsylvania Coal
Company, they projected another
road, to be built along the old Dela
ware and Hudson Canal. The Penn
sylvania Coal Company was a com
paratively small concern. Its output
amounted to only five per cent of the
total. It had $5,000,000 capital stock
—a good deal of it scattered in rather
small holdings. Morgan & Co. quietly
gathered in the majority of the stock.
Now just what Morgan & Co. paid
for that $5,000,000 of Pennsylvania
Coal Company stock has never been
disclosed; but the house turned the
stock over to the Erie Railroad, which
issued therefor $32,000,000 of four
per cent bonds and $5,000,000 of four
per cent preferred stock. It was sup
posed that this $5,000,000 of pre
ferred stock represented the bankers’
commissions, or bonus; but that is
neither here nor there. The Pennsyl
vania Coal Company was the key to a
monopoly of hard coal. The monopoly
has been in perfect working order
ever since. Interest and dividends on
the securities issued by the Erie road
in payment for Pennsylvania Coal
Company stock amount to sixty cents
on each ton of that company’s out
put. But what of that? They might
as well have amounted to $1.60. Con
sumers of monopolized hard coal
would have had to pay it.
The Water-logged Erie.
Reading had been staggering for
years under a debt created to buy un
developed coal lands in the hope of a
monopoly. As soon as this Morgan
deal made monopoly effective, Read
ing figured that on the basis of the
price paid for the Pennsylvania Coal
Company’s lands, its own coal lands
were worth $125,000,000 —so it wasn’t
overcapitalized at all!
Erie’s previous experiences in the
stock-watering line had been exten
sive and picturesque. From 1868 to
1872, in the able hands of Daniel
Drew, Jay Gould, and James Fisk, its
share capital was increased from
$17,000,000 to $78,000,000. Nearly all
of this increase was mere fiat, put out
for speculative purposes and with
scarcely a pretense that any actual
value lay behind the issue. Reams of
stock were printed and put out by
night for the pious purpose of break
ing Commodore Vanderbilt’s corner
in the shares.
In 1895 the road, being bankrupt,
underwent a typical reorganization,
conducted by Mr. Morgan. There
were outstanding, for example, $33,-
597,000 second-mortgage bonds. In
the reorganization these bonds re
ceived seventy-five per cent of their
face value in new four yer cent
bonds, and fifty-five per cent in new
four per cent preferred stock, or 130
per cent in all. The old $77,837,000
bogus common stock was converted
into a like amount of new common
stock. There was issued $63,000,000
of first and second preferred stock, a
large part of which was distributed
as sweeteners and bonuses to recon
cile the old security holders.
Mr. Morgan’s Game.
This preferred stock entailed no
fixed charge upon the road. Divi
dends were to be paid on it only if

their infamous origin, their grip and
their danger to the republic. It shows
the remedy for the social and industrial
evils which unpractical reformers are
seeking. It is not pessimistic, though
it treats of oppressive Injustices: but
is emphatically hopeful of the complete
victory over giant wrongs when the
new-old remedy here advocated is ap

you a higher ideal for your own life,
