plainly evinced. After a short exam
ination, he heaved a sigh, -and looked
behind him to see if the way was
clear. It was plain that his mind was
now made up; but, to satisfy the
world that he would do nothing rash
ly, he took another view, and then
wheeled and went for Harrisburg as
if he had set in for a year’s running.
Nobody whooped at Gridiron, for all
saw that his run was purely the re
sult of philosophic deduction. The
reader will not suppose all this con
sumed half the time which has been
consumed in telling it, though it might
have been so without interrupting the
amusement; for Miss Spitfire’s flight
had completely suspended it for a
time.
The remaining competitors now
went on with the sport. A few rounds
showed plainly that Odum or Bostwick
would be the victor; but which, no
one could tell. Whenever either of
them came round, the gander’s neck
was sure of a severe wrench. Many
a half pint of Jamaica was staked
upon them, besides other things. The
poor gander stood many a strong pull
before his wailings ceased. At length,
however, they were hushed by Odum.
Then came Bostwick, and broke the
neck. The next grasp of Odum, it
was thought, would bear away the
head; but it did not. Then Bostwick
was sure of it; but he missed it. Now
Odum must surely have it. All is in
terest and animation; the horses
swept round with redoubled speed;
every eye is upon Odum; his backers
smiling, Bostwick’s trembling. To the
rope‘he comes; lifts his hand; when.lo!
Fat John Fulger had borne it away
the second before. All were astonish
ed, all disappoined, and some were
vexed a little; for it was now clear
that “If it hadn’t o’ been for his great
fat, greasy paw,” to use their own
language, “Odum would have gained
the victory.” Others cursed “that long
legged Zube Zin, who was so high
he didn’t know when his set were
cold, for bringing such a nag as Sal
Spitfire to a gander pullen; for if
he’d o’ been in his place, it would
o’ flung Bostwick right where that
gourd o’ hog lard (Fulger) was.”
Fulger’s conduct was little calculat
ed to reconcile them to their disap
pointment.
“Come here, Neddy Prator,” said he,
with a triumphant smile; “let your
Uncle Johnny put his potato stealer
(hand) into that hat, and tickle the
chins of them are shiners a little!
Oh you little shining sons o’ bitches’
walk into your Mas’ Johnny’s pocket,
and jingle so as Arch Odum and Gory
Bostwick may hear you! You hear
’em, Gory? Boys’ don’t pull with men
any more. I’ve jist got my hand in!
I wish I had a pond full o’ ganders
here now, jist to show how I could
make their heads fly. Bet all I’ve
won, you may hang three upon that
rope, and I’ll set Slouch at full speed,
and take off the heads of all three
the first grab; two with my hands and
one with my teeth.”
Thus he went on, but really there
was no boasting in all this; it was
all fun; for John knew, and all were
convinced that he knew, that his suc
cess was entirely the result of acci
dent. John was really “a good-natur
ed fellow,” and his cavorting had an
effect directly opposite to that which
the reader would suppose it had; it
reconciled all to their disappointment
save one, I except little Billy Mixen,
of Spirit Creek, who had staked the
net proceeds of six quarts of huckleber
ries upon Odum, which he had been
long keeping for a safe bet. He could
not be reconciled until he fretted him
self into a pretty little piney-woods
fight, in which he got whipped; and
then he went home perfectly satisfied.
Fulger spent all his winnings with
Prator In treats to the company; made
most of them drunk, and thereby
produced four Georgia rotations; after
which all parted good friends.

WHAT IS SAID ABOUT US.
Macon, Ga., Jan. 18, 1907.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson.
Dear Tom: The splendid il Mag
azine” and “Weekly Jeffersonian”
both, which your kindness prompted
you to order to my address, arrived
in due season and have been greatly
enjoyed. I appreciate both of the
journals for their intrinsic merit and
for the personal remembrance of
which they are the kindly expression.
Long may you live to hold up the
standard of Democracy and its glo
rious founder. Truly your friend,
A. J. Battle.
*
Norwood, Ga., Jan. 17, 1907.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Sir: I see from the
Weekly Jeffersonian that the New
York ‘ 1 Watson Magazine” has gone
to the wall.
I glory in no man’s misfortune, but
I am certainly glad to know that this
magazine is a thing of the past. The
only glory it ever had came from your
connect ion with it, and when you, its
very life-blood, left it, it did a very
natural thing—died.
I hope the Weekly Jeffersonian and
the Jeffersonian Magazine will live
long and be powerful to do battle for
the cause of right and the great mass
of the people.
Like Dr. Forrester, I believe that
you are coming into your own, and
that your power with the people is
growing, and that the day is not far
distant when your voice will be heard
and heeded as it has never been be
fore.
I send check for $2. Please send
me the Jeffersonian Magazine, and
push my subscription to the Weekly
Jeffersonian up one year.
Yours very truly,
W. L. Hawes.
Miller, Ga., Jan. 26, 1907.
The Weekly Jeffersonian, Atlanta,
Georgia.
Dear Sirs: I have heard so many
compliment paid the Weekly on its
new form that I am compelled to take
a small part of your time in telling
you so. Your every subscriber here
is highly pleased with the paper and
it is growing in influence and power
every day.
With best wishes and kindest re
gards, I am, yours truly,
A. S. Anderson.

The Jeffersonian, Tom Watson’s
popular weekly, looks as neat and is
as newsy in its get-up as a pretty girl
graduate who has just completed a
trip through Europe. No matter how
great Tom Watson’s success, it will
not reaeh beyond our wish.—Buchan
an, Ga., Tribune.
TOM WATSON.
The Hon. Thomas E. Watson has
already done more to educate the
people along political lines than any
other man in all the country.
He is now better prepared than
ever before to lead the people on
to still greater heights of knowledge
and purity in government.—Canon,
Ga., Herald.
THE WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
Tom Watson is doing the wise thing
by staying out of the Farmers’ Un
ion.—Irwinville, Ga. Courier.
*
Tom Watson will address th n
Farmers’ Union in Atlanta on Jan
uary 22. We would like to be there
and hear Tom talk to those wool-hat,
one-gallus sons of toil. He’ll have
something to tell them they never
heard before, and will be reminded of
“about fifteen years ago.”—Malison,
Ga.. Madisonian.
The Weekly Jeffersonian Magazine
is one of the best publications of the
kind in the country, and the maga
zine promises to win a circulation and
popularity beyond anything that
could be hoped for from the New
York effort. Thos. E. Watson’s per
sonality fills the columns of each of
these publications, and no one who
wants to keep abreast of the reform
movements now being discussed can
afford not to read these publications.
They are both very much alive and
intensely Watsonian.—LaGrange, Ga.,
Reporter.

Mr. Watson has moved his Jeffer
sonian to Atlanta from Augusta. The
last number appeared in a new dress
and new form and was full to the
brim with choice reading matter. Mr.
Watson is going to devote most of
his time to his publications which
means that his subscribers will <ret
the worth of their money.—Darien,
Ga., Gazette.
*
Watson’s Jeffersonian has been
moved from Augusta to Atlanta, and
issued in a semi-magazine shape. Tt
is gotten up in good shape excent that
the mixture of body tyne is not very
pleasing to the eye. If the entire
paper was set in Century type instead
of mixing in a sharp, light-face the
Weekly Jeffersonian would be very
much improved in mechanical appear
ance. Brother Watson, compare the
pages sot in the Century with those
set in the sharp-face type and note
the great improvement.—Douglas,
Ga., News.
R
Weekly Jeffersonian is the name of
a weekly newspaper that is coming
to this office, and it is full to the
hrim of good, solid Democratic read
ing, as well it might, being edited
by the peerless Thos. E. Watson, at
Atlanta, Ga.—San Marcos, Tex.,
Times.
The Weeklv Jeffersonian has been
moved to Atlanta and will he pub
lished in the future from that point.
Tt came out last week in a brand new
dress and the “Little Miss” looks
good to us. Here’s to the Weekly
Jeffersonian: Long may it live and
grow and flourish to defend the
rights of the “common people”
against the greedy robbery of the
heartless soulless money monsters.—
Ashburn, Ga., Baner.
TWO JEFFERSONIANS.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson has mov
ed the Weekly Jeffersonian to At
lanta, where he will publish his mag
azine and his paper from the same
place. The two Jeffersonians prom
ise to be “in the thick of the fight
in 1908, to smite the trusts hip and
thigh,” Mr. Watson is doing some
vigorous writing. Whether we agree
with Tom Watson or not, we always
like to read what he says.—Savan
nah, Ga., Press.
*
The Weekly Jeffersonian’s place of
publication has been changed from
Augusta to Atlanta, and the style of
the paper has been altered to advan
tage. Its news service is extensive
and its editorials are, of course,
strong. Altogether, it is an excel
lent weekly.—Cuthbert, Ga., Leader.
*
THE WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
The Weekly Jeffersonian has under
gone a slight change in its form. It
is now published in Atlanta along
with the Monthly Jeffersonian; and
has been changed to the size of the
standard literary weeklies, like 'Col
lier’s, Saturday Evening Post and
others. And the Jeffersonian is brim
ful of live topics ably discussed each
week.—Woodbury, Ga., Georgian.

The discharge of the battalion of
colored troops, by the president, may
be illustrated in this way: You em
ploy twenty men to perform certain
work, all working together and con
stituting one crew. The crew be
come riotous and break out, and
wound and kill peaceful citizens.
Only a paid of the crew is engaged
in the riot, but when you try to dis
cover the offenders and punish them,
the whole crew remains silent and
it refuses to disclose the guilty ones.
The men who conceal the guilty ones
become equally as guilty as the ones
who did the deed, and you are with
out redress. If you fail to discharge
the entire number, you retain in ser
vice men who are dangerous to the
peace and welfare of the community,
and crime goes unpunished. You
condemn yourself in the eyes of the
people, and you put a premium on
crime, because you say, the boys you
know, refuse to tell who the guilty
are, and for fear I would discharge
men who did not participate, I will
not discharge any. You say by your
act that they may conspire together,
some of them commit crime, and the
others refuse to tell who the guilty
are, and in this manner all hold their
employment, notwithstanding the
commission of the offense. This il
lustrates the trouble in the battalion
of troops discharged by the presi-*
dent. Some of them had committed
crime and their companions refused
to tell who the guilty were, thus shar
ing a part of the responsibility for
the crime, besides being guilty of in
subordination. The only thing the
president could do was to discharge
the whole battalion.—The Search
light, Fargo, N. D.
