Secure Court Order That Closes

Troy, Kan.—Evangelist Edward
Clutter of Troy, Kansas, states that
he is a one hundred per cent Ameri
can, a Mason, an Odd Fellow, and a
members of the A. P. A. He is a
graduate of Cotner university and
post graduate of Engene Bible uni
versity. He is a Christian minister
but takes no part in the ecclesiastical
machinery of the Disciples of Christ
denomination. He has evangelized
from the Gulf of Mexico to far north
in Canada, establishing churches, and
under his labors more than ten thou
sand people have been converted.
Last January he accepted the pas
torate of the Christian church in Troy,
Kansas, and all went well until one
Sunday in June a number of men in
white robes quietly and orderly
marched into the church and took
seats, giving closest attention to the
special flag day sermon on the sub
ject, Americanism and Christianity.
Immediately some of the enemies who
had been boasting that they had re
moved the Baptist minister from
Troy, got busy, with the result that
when about a month ago Mr. Clutter
introduced a National K. K. K. speak
er and led in prayer at a great meet
ing near Troy, pressure was brought
to bear so that the next day Mr.
Clutter was informed by two mem
bers of the board that his services
were no longer required.
The next Sunday part of the board
met while the evening services were
in progress and voted to give written
notice that Mr. Clutter should close
his work in sixty days. The following
Sunday evening an audience of three
hundred was present, and the Chris
tian church being supposed to be a
democratic institution having congre
gational government, the congrega
tion voted by a large majority to re
tain the minister.
It was also voted that a short meet
ing should immediately be held by Mr.
and Mrs. Clutter.
On Monday night a large audience
was present, but on Tuesday the ser
vants of the enemy got busy, hired
Catholic lawyers and with Joe Griffin,
manager of the White Eagle Filling
Station, Charles Marble, Jr., principal
of the Troy high school; M. F. Ear
hart, Samuel Blauser, H. D. Kent, Jr.,
John Malloy, J. C. Dittemore, and
Wm. Etherton, all farmers, as plain
tiffs, went before Judge C. W. Ryan,
and filed restraining orders against
Mr. Clutter preaching or permitting
others to hold services in the church.
The sad thing about the matter is
that some of these men had once
pledged themselves to true American
ism, but under the influence of the
two first named submitted them
selves to this un-American and un-
Christian act.
On Wednesday night Mrs. Clutter
conducted the services, and the-next
day a large padlock was placed on
the door barring her and many others
from divine services in a house dedi
cated to the service of God in a coun
try whose constitution gjves to its
citizens the right of free speech and
peaceable public assembly.

60,000 AT HOUSTON
Great Assembly Demonstrates Klan
Houston, Tex.—The greatest crowd
ever assembled in South Texas watch
ed the gigantic Klan initiation at the
Gulf Coast Speedway Saturday night.
More than 60,000 people were pres
ent.
The grandstand was crowded to ca
pacity and more than 12,000 auto
mobiles jammed all highways leading
to the grounds.
The crowd began arriving at six
o’clock. Half an hour later cars were
moving slowly toward the racing
grounds four abreast. More than an
hour was required to get from the
end of Main street to the stands, a
mile away.
All south Texas was 'represented.
Beaumont, Port Arthur, Orange, Gal
veston and other towns and cities
were represented by large delega
tions.
A corps of hooded and robed sen
tinels directed traffifficffi through the
jam. Automobiles were deserted on
the sides of roads and* the occupants
pushed their way into the grounds.
In clear audible terms, the Exalted
Cyclops announced that the time had
arrived for the candidates to bow be
neath the fiery cross and assume the
obligation to the American flag and
the emblem of the Invisible Empire.
As the great fiery cross blazed in
the darkness, a hush fell over the
crowd. A gifted speaker delivered a
remarkable adress on the great prin
ciples of the Klan. His speech was
received with deafening applause.
The degree team took its station
and the exalted cyclops called the
body to attention. The march through
the long lines of hooded and robed
members of the great American or
der to the sacred altar of the invis
ible empire was begun by the unnat
uralized.
Every ear was strained as the con
ductor issued the oath of the klan to
the candidates. Each repeated the
solemn vow in unison.
The great throng was thoroughly
Klan. Frequent outbursts of applause
greeted the members as they went
about work.
The ceremonial ended shortly be
fore midnight. It was an hour later
before the cars untangled themselves
and the last of the spectators had
gone.
It was two hours later when fire
was discovered in the stands.
The grandstand accommodated
more than 5,000 spectators during the
ceremonial and was reduced to ashes
before morning.
No on knows how the grandstand
caught fire. Firemen say it might
have been a lighted cigarette dropped
carelessly through the seats or some
hair-brained enemy of the Klan seek
ing revenge through the antics of
Nero.
The great demonstration proved
that the Klan spirit has a greater
hold on south Texas today than ever
before. The Jews shuddered. The
Catholics foamed at the mouth and
Father Kirwin turned an epileptic
somersault in Galveston.
The Klan today is the strongest in
stitution in this section of the coun
try.
It will be the next time you hear
from it.
The United Irish Societies, meet
ing in Chicago last week voted that
“America” was not a patriotic song
because its air is similar to the
British national anthem.
Pontiac Klan, Realm of Michigan,
held a big open air ceremonial last
week which was attended by several
thousand Klansmen from adjoining
Klantons. This is the second big
open air naturalization held there
during the past few months.

KLAN STILL WINNING
FAVOR IN MOREHOUSE
—K-K-K
Like Oklahoma Attack, Frame-up
Really Helped Order.
—K-K-K
In view of the Oklahoma farce it
is interesting to recall what effect
the frame-up on the Klan in More
house parish, Louisiana, has had up
on the order. The pastor of a Bap
tist church in Ashley county, Arkan
sas, which joins Morehouse parish,
gives this account of Klan activity.
“The Klan in 12 months time has
revolutionized law and order condi
tions in Ashley county. It has work
ed entirely through the courts. It
has not one case of “rough stuff” to
its credit. Its methods have been
orderly and exceedingly effective.
“It is making its influence felt in
% this community, just as the More
house Klan is doing, by co-operating
with the officers and the courts in
maintaining the law and enforcing it
in an orderly way. The Klan here,
as well as in Morehouse parish and
all other Klans is composed of the
clean, law abiding element of the
community. In the state the Klan in
fluence is the same as in the comr
munity, on a wider scale.
“The press everywhere has de
liberately declined to publish the facts
about the Morehouse parish trouble,
preferring to champion the cause of
the Parker-Coco plot to put Prot
estants out of business in- Catholic
Louisiana. The Klan never murdered
Watt Daniel and T. F. Richards—
most people in Morehouse parish
where the trouble occurred, believe
that Richards is now alive and in
Mexico. Disinterested people who
heard the so-called investigation last
January do not believe that the
bodies taken from the reptile-infest
ed waters of Lake La Fouurche in a
good state of preservation, four
months after the hot 24th of August
were the bodies of Daniel and Rich
ards; such people believe the bodies
were deliberately put in the lake by
enemies of the Klan—a part of the
Parker-Coco plot. (
“The general attitude of this com
munity is favorable to the Klan. Its
numbers have multiplied many times
in these parts since the Parker-Coco
persecutions began; a few weeks ago
25,000 Klansmen initiated a class of
1,000 near Little Rock. I believe that
more than 75 per cent of all the
ministers of Protestant denomina
tions in this part of the country are
members and they are all loyally
supporting it. I speak from personal
knowledge as to membership of Prot
estant ministers being a member my
self.
“The Klan, by its vigilant efforts
and firm stand for law enforcement
has made the Volstead prohibition
statute function in a marked degree
throughout Arkansas.”

STOP REVIVAL MEETING
—K-K-K—
--BLOCKADE STREETS TO
STOP KLAN MEETING
—K-K-K
Much indignation is being manifest
in Louisville, Kentucky, following the
autocratic action of the officials there,
one night last week when police were
ordered to blockade two streets and
in so doing kept Protestants away
from a revival meeting being held
in a large tabernacle there. The ac
tion was taken, the police declare, to
stop a meeting of the Louisville Klan
which was to be held in the open near
the tabernacle. Reports from every
section of the Blue Grass state show
that the membership in the Klan is
increasing at a tremendous rate.

Responsibility for the slaying of
Klansman Thos. R. Abbott was not
fixed by Allegheny County, Pennsyl
vania, coroner’s jury inquest last
week. The jury found Abbott came
to his death from a gunshot wound
inflicted by a person or persons un
known and recommending that the
person or persons be apprehended
and held for the grand jury on a
charge of murder. Two common
wealth witnesses, Harry Albright,
Carnegie, and B. F. Hellings, Wil
kinsburg, identified Patrick McDer
mott, Carnegie undertaker, as shoot
ing at Abbott.
Albright, who is not a Klansman,
has known McDermott fifteen years,
he declared, and remonstrated with
McDermott when he saw him shoot
asking why he shot in “cold blood.”

AT TEXAS STATE FAIR

--WOMEN OF THE KU KLUX KLAN
TO TAKE PART IN KLAN
DAY CEREMONIES
—K-K-K
According to George K. Butcher,
General Chairman for Klan Day at
the state fair of Texas on Wednes
day, October 24, the Women of the
Ku Klux Klan will take a prpminefit
part in the festivities of the day.
Miss A. B. Cloud, Imperial Klailiff of
the Women of the Ku Klux Klan,
stated that several of the national
officers of that organization would
attend the state fair on Klan Day
and that Mrs. T. D. Barr of Indian
apolis, Ind., national lecturer for the
organization, would address the ladies
on that date.
Women’s Band of 150 Pieces
The band of 150 pieces of the
Women of the Ku Klux Klan was
organized in November, 1922, and
they are now credited with being the
largest and best trained organization
of its kind in the United States.
They have a complete'' instrumenta
tion and will give a program of clas
sical and popular numbers on Klan
Day at the state fair of Texas.
Klanswomen From Over the United
States Invited
The Women of the Ku Klux Klan
have invited every member of that
organization over the entire United
States to send a delegation to Dallas
on Klan Day, and they have received
acceptances from hundreds of cities
stating that large delegations would
be sent to Dallas. Miss Cloud states
that a large class will be publicly
initiated in the evening, and the pub
lic will have an opportunity of see
ing the Women of the Ku Klux Klan
give their ceremony for the first time
in the South.

CHICAGO KLAN COMES
BACK INTO FOLD
—K-K-K
Chicago Klan Number 11, misled
by insidious propaganda against the
national administration of the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, was
one of three Klans in the United
States which last month severed con
nections with the Imperial Palace,
Atlanta, Ga.
On Monday, September 24, this
Klan, by a unanimous vote of the
membership at a well attended meet
ing, declared their loyalty to the na
tional administration and the Grand
Dragon of Illinois. They requested
that they be allowed to affiliate with
the national organization once more.
Their petition was granted by the
Grand Dragon.
Requests from the other two Chi
cago Klans which temporarily left
the organization of the Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan to the effect that
they be permitted to again affiliate
are being considered by the Grand
Dragon of Illinois. There are thirty
one Klans in Chicago.

E. Leigh of Randolph, were the
speakers at a meeting held here in
Golden Cross hall last week.
The Ku Klux Klan was the sub

much-discussed organization was
brought out in the speeches. Dr.
Lannin declared that some of the
highest officials of the city of Port
land were members of the order.
Plans are now under way to build a
Klan temple in Portland, Dr. Lannin
said, one that will seat 7,000 people,
and will be a temple second to none
in Maine.
Rev. Leigh stated that while he
was not a member of the Ku Klux
Klan, he was in full accord with thfe
principles of the order and would
willingly join if permitted to do so.
Rev. Leigh is a Methodist minister.

KLAN HAS BIG MEETING
AT MASON, ILLINOIS
6000 People Assemble For All-Day
Celebration Which Closes With
Naturalization of 160 At Night.
—K-K-K
Mason, 111.—Last Saturday was
Klan day in Effingham county. A
big celebration was held in a field
two miles south of Mason, beginning
at noon, and closing with a natural
ization ceremony at night, under the
auspices of the Mason Klan.
Twenty-five hundred were
in attendance at the afternoon ses
sion. This number swelled to six
thousand at night. By actual count
1,250 automobiles entered the grounds
during the day.
WALTON OFFERS TO RESIGN
(Continued from Page One)
out expenditure of the people’s
money upon the inconsistent pretense
of maintaining a visible government.
“The constitution of the state of
Oklahoma as originally adopted de
fines the rights of its citizens, and
any officer who ruthlessly tramples
upon these sacred guarantees de
serves the scorn and condemnation of
every right-thinking citizen. The
governor of Oklahoma should be im
peached as speedily as possible, if
human rights, the integrity of our
courts, and the orderly administra
tion of justice are to be maintained.”
The keynote was echoed when
“Ragen’s Colts,” a notorious gang of
Roman Catholics from Chicago’s
“back o’ the yards” district, wired
the governor that their organization
had voted $5,000 to defray the ex
penses of an “expeditionary” force of
gunmen to Oklahoma points as re
inforcements for Walton’s fighters.
The racial and religious feeling
aroused is the work of the “Walton
ites.” The opposition of the Klan to
Governor Walton and its demand for
his impeachment is not based upon
the fight he has made against the
organization but because of his un-
American conduct in office.
Among the reasons for his re
moval from office are:
He has refused to permit execution
of state laws most wholesome and
necessary for the public good.
Abused the pardon and parole
power.
Authorized numbers of persons to
carry arms.
Appointed convicts as peace offi
cers.
Recognized the right of a minority
to rule and dictate the policies of
state government.
Excited class antagonism and en
deavored to array class against class,
and religion against religion, there
by to gain his political aims and de
sires. ✓
Directed certain claves to shoot
and kill others, offering immediate
pardons.
Assumed legislative authority “in
opposition to the constitution and
laws of the state.”
Appointed multitudes of new offi
cers and sent them throughout the
state to harass the people and “make
them bow to his acts of despotism.”
Called out the National Guard
without just cause, placed the state
under martial law without just cause,
and has stationed soldiers in certain
communities without reason therefor.
Through threats and otherwise
sought to render the military inde
pendent of and superior to the civil
powers.
That he is establishing, in effect, a
dictatorship to supplant constitu
tional government, and using the
military forces ... to enforce
his decrees.
That because of his opposition to
an initiated legislative petition pro
viding for the convening of the leg
islature, which petition had been
signed by more than 50,000 legal
voters of this state, he caused many
departmental clerks, at state ex
pense and in open violation of our
statutes, to spend much time in an
endeayor to find discrepancies in said
petition; that after a special grand
jury had been called by the district
judge to investigate into these un
lawful acts, he, in his eagerness to
avoid such investigation and the con
sequences thereof, and to secure im
munity therefrom, arbitrarily and
without lawful excuse, declared mar
tial law in the whole state; . . .
and by military force refused to per
mit the courts of justice to function.

RAGEN’S COLTS CHICAGO’S
MOST NOTORIOUS GANG
Ragen’s Colts, Chicago’s most
notorious gang, is made up entire
ly of Irish Catholics from the
Stock Yards district. Headed by
Frank Ragen, a former county
commissioner, and operated as an
“Athletic club,” this gang has
been the instigator of riots,
der, and every form of disorder
known.
Its members have been guilty
of numerous crimes.
When this gang, numbering
2,500 members, voted $5,000 to
send terrorists to the aid of Ok
lahoma’s chief executive he wired
their leaders that he needed finan
cial help even more than addi
tional gunmen. The “Colts” are
now raising funds among the
Irish Catholics to continue the bat
tle against the Ku Klux—&nd
they have sent more than 100
gangsters into Oklahoma since
Tuesday’s election to “help” the
governor.
The “Colts” precipitated the
race riots here in July, 1919, in
which 36 white people and negroes
were killed. Their record was
such that even John J. Garrity,
Irish Catholic chief of police, sus
pended their “club” license and
kept them from operating during
his term in office.
Upon reorganizing the “Colts”
offered their services to officials
of the so-called American Unity
and suggested a campaign of in
timidation against the Ku Klux
Klan in Chicago.
This gang was investigated
when the Dawn’s printing estab
lishment, and the business houses
of a number of advertisers were
bombed early this year.

“CRAZY JACK” AND HIS CAP
PISTOL
“Pooh!” cries the doughty Gover
nor of Oklahoma, in a new expres
sion of dislike for the legislators of
his state. “I could take a cap pistol
and chase those fellows into the Red
River!”
Then why did he call out the Na
tional Guard to do it, and order the
soldiers to “shoot to kill” any law
maker who attempted to exercise his
constitutional rights? And why did
the Governor make a frantic appeal
for funds to banditism all over the
state in order that he might have
more than the $200,000 available from
the state treasury for paying militia
men to awe the legislators ? And
why has such a brave man put the en
tire commonwealth under martial rule
instead of shouldering his cap pistol
and marching forth to wage war upon
all other Oklahomans?
His most ardent supporters secretly
doubt that “Crazy Jack” knows what
he is doing. It is equally apparent
that he does not realize what he is
saying. Every time Gov. Walton
opens his mouth he either tells a lie
or convicts himself of having uttered
one a moment before.—“ The Patriot”
