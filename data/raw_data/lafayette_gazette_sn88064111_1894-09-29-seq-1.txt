can make yourself. Sew a sufficient cur
number of breadths of awning to reach exp

edges and sew stout curtain rings every his
few inches along the top to hang on tho

curly head reposed an elaborate and

When the good dominie commenced

thoughts were evidently on his fair

Not so with the young lady. She
immediately bowed her head on the

of her hat brushed the back of the
young man's neck.
