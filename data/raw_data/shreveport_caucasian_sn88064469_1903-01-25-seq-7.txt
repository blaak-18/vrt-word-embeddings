THE ORAND JURY
REPORTED INDICTMENTS AND
BILLS IGNORED.
A suggestion, for a Criminal Judge
to Handle Criminal Cases in
Caddo Parish.
The grand jury submitted its report
on January 22, as follows:
To the Honorable A. I). Land. Judge
of the First Judicial District Court: We
the grand jurors for the January term
of the district court, the year 1903, beg
leave to submit the following report:
We have examined t21 cases, found 59
true bills, ignored 58 cases and passed
4 cases for want of evidence. We have
examined parish jail and find same in
good sanitary condition and prisoners
well treated. We will earnestly recorl
mend the creation of an additional dis
trict judge for the parish of Caddo, the
increase of both civil and criminal bus
ianess in (he last few years in said par
ish having been so great as to necessi
tate the creation of an additional judge
who will be especially required to dis
pose of criminal cases. Having cocn
pleted our investigation, we ask of you
to be discharged.

INTENSIVE READING.
This Juven.tle C:oneentratedilm Sabh
Sects With a Vt1'relenee.
A Chicago merchant foulnd his of
cflee boy often engaged In reading in
stch an absheorbed way Ihat he deter
mined to encourage suclh a good habit,
thinking the reading was beneficial.
On questioning the boy, he was' aston
lahed to find what had occupied all hsle
snpare time and asked him for a list of
the Iooks he had read recently. Here
is 1tn1 exact copy of the list as written
in the boy's own hand. In spite of
numerous repetitions It s',ould be read
through, for only ill thils way can one
get the full. cumunlated effect. I copy
as accurately as pos.ible. The umu
htrs probuly refer to certain volumes
in some series or "library:"
1 James Boys or the Bandit I't Shot
2 Chasing the James Boys or a Detectlve
dangerous (CAe
3 The James Bnoys end Pinkerton or
Frank andti Jesse as detective
4 The Man from nowhere and his ad
ventures with Jesse
5 Jesse James and 81roc: or a rhasefor
a horse
STlhe James Boys in Texst
25 The James Boys in deadwood
30 The James Boys Blunder
a 'rThe James Boys in danger
40 The James Boys Mlstake
45 The James Boys island
50 The James Boldest Raid
65 The James Boys dead Shot

67 The James Boy [urrendler or Carl

68 The Jamees Boy in the Mountain or
Carl Greene the detective Great Burprise
The lrndyk and the Factory Girl or a
Secret of a poison envelope.
Thlis i what youl might cnll concen
trated or intensive reading. There is
no scattering over the broad tield of
ndventurous lheroes. With one exqep
tion, in which he has gone astray on
the Bradys and thle Factory Girl, the
devoted young stiudent has been ai
sten(ly to hist subject as ever Carlyle
was to the dventturous Frederick or
Macaulay to the adventurous \Villiaal
or P'rofessor Sloan to the adventurtous
Nalpoleon. Hle detserves this meed of
praise. lie lhas followed the advice so
often given to youthful readers not to
scatter their reading, but to choose
some stlbJect and read It up thorough
ly.
The writing shows that the boy -iP
not wholly illiterate, for, while he hasn
no marks tor puretttiton or the poe
sesalve, every word is spelled correctly.

Cape Cod
Station
(Special Correspondence.]
Wellfleet, Mass., Jan. 19.-Thlis little
Cape Cod town is just now a center of
observation for not only the people of
Cape Cod,,but also for the general pub
lic, inasmuch tis Marconi, the king of
wireless telegraphy, is here testing the
apparatus installed In the Marconi stu
tion which has recently been completed.
The station is located about four miles
from the ancient Jo Holbrook tavern,
in Welifleet, and one and a half miles
from the railway depot in South Well
fleet. It stands on a stretch of land the
highest for miles down or up the ('ape.
the site having been chosen by Mar
coni himself, who visited Wellfleet In
May, 1901, while exploring Cape Cod to
find a suitable spot for a station. It is
perhaps more than 100 feet above sea
level, and since the station has been
oewatructed mariners have found the
fotr lofty towers very useful as land
marks.
As completed, the Wellfleet structure
bears a strong resemblance to the wlr(.
less depots at Table Head and at I'ol
dhu, Cornwall, but the station here was
bnilt only after some strenuous wortk
and in the face of difficultiles not expe
rlenced at the places just named. Tbh,
netarest dwelling house is a nile away,
and the wint, which has an unintter
rupted sweep across this stretch of
land, often rises to the violence of' a
hurricane, blowing the sand throu;'l
the air so fiercely that blood will be
drawn from the faces of those who are
unfortunate enough to be exposed to
the combined assaults of wind and
sand.
The region, moreover, is as desolate
as one could well find anywhere. There
is not enough fertility In the soil to a!
low at tree to grow to a respectable
height, and the stretch that is not whol
ly sand Is covered with a growth of
wipilah grass, an ' odd reeping vine
and stunted pines. But Mtaroni deemed
it the best poysible place from which to
conduct ilis operatio.s iatnd made light
of the fact that'the statlom- would at all

[Special Correspondence.1
New York, Jan. 10.--Who shall dare
say that women are not growing more
economical in these days, for do they
not have two bodices to every dress so
that it may serve for at least two dif
ferent occasions? One bodice is made
!e to reach quite to the ears, and it has
of long sleves, so that it may be suitable
f for afternoon visits and all sorts of
semidress occasions. The other has
short sleeves and is cut low on the neck
for dinners where stately dames and
lovely young girls gather to show their
prettiest costumes, and they are also
worn for dancing, though naturally
this use must depend to a certain ex
tent upon the material in the gown and
Its fashioning, for not all thinhts suita
ble for a dinner or reception frock are
just exactly right for a ball dress. But
the pretty flittered nets are made over
silk slips, and so that material is right
to wear.
The illustration shows a black net
wrought In arabesque design with
black spangles, and this is made up
ovetr white taffeta. The collar of the
high neckel waist is thickly covered
with black spangles, and the belt is
