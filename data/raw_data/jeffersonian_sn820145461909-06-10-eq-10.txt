Jas. B. Park’s Speech of Welcome
to the Convention Held in Greensboro,
Georgia, May 31, 1909
Mr. President and Members of the
Rural Carriers of the Eighth
Congressional District:
It has been my pleasure to extend
to various conventions addresses of
welcome to our beautiful city, but I
do not know of any organization
that I would rather welcome than
yours. And in behalf of the citizens
of this place I say to each and all of
you, that you are not only welcomed,
but we are charmed to have you with
us, and we trust that every moment
of your visit will be full of pleasure
and enjoyment.
The motive that prompts us to ex
tend to your body our most cordial
felicitations grows out of the fact
that we realize the important part
that the rural carriers throughout the
United States are doing for the ma
terial and intellectual development
of our great country.
Among these benefits may be men
tioned the improvements of our
highways, and allow me to say, that
in my humble opinion this is one of
the great essentials for building up
a great country. Thomas Jefferson
truly said that the prosperity of any
nation depended on the success of
the tillers of the soil, and without
good roads our agricultural interests
will never reach that high ideal that
we all devoutly wish.
While Caesar did much for the
glory and beauty of the Roman Em
pire, the most enduring monument
that he left to posterity was the mag
nificent roads that he constructed
throughout his dominions. We are
glad that the carriers of Georgia de
manded that our convicts should be
placed on the public highways, and
in a few years all of us will see the
wisdom of this step.
Another great benefit that flows
from your work is the information
that is afforded to the great masses
of our rural population throughout
the length and breadth of this great
Republic and the general Govern
ment is working hand in hand with
our state governments for the better
ment and amelioration of country
life, and this is the foundation stone
upon which our Government rests.
While we feel justly proud of our
past history, we can truthfully say
that its brightest pages are now be
ing written by universal education
Dear Mr. Watson: —Have just read
the June Magazine. Your informa
tion on Missions is appreciated by a
grateful people who hunger and
thirst after knowledge for righteous
ness’ sake.
It is the talk of the hour. The
Sully article and Missions is easily
worth the price of the publication 12
months.
I was glad to note the “Suggestion
that will be adopted” by Mr. J. T.
Hudson, Sr., of Amity, Ga. Your ar
ticles of prose poems are rich and de
serve a place all to themselves.
“The Dream Babies,” “Soldier,
Take Thy Wounds,” etc., are gems of
the purest and sweetest thoughts.
And it gives people who imagine
that you are hard-hearted and cruel
an insight to your very soul which
Jsfee 3cffersonlan
and universal information that is be
ing diffused among the masses of the
people. Should we still progress as
we have in the past, we can truth
fully prophesy that eye has not seen,
nor ear heard, neither has it entered
into the imagination of man, the rich
blessings that await us in the future.
While we have many errors to cor
rect, I belong to that class of optim
ists that believe that we are moving
steadily onward and upward and our
country is greatest of any on the
globe, and we truly and in fact are
living in the land of the free and the
home of the brave.
Many other things could I mention
that your organization is doing for
the advancement of this country, but
time forbids that I should trespass
on your deliberations; suffice it to
say, that we wish you God speed in
your noble work.
It is well that you should have
these annual meetings in order to
mingle with each other and to devise
means for the betterment of the ser
vice, and whatever you see proper to
recommend, I sincerely trust that
our Senators and Congressmen will
give your recommendations proper
and due consideration, for I know
that you will be governed by wisdom,
justice and moderation.
This address would be incomplete
should I fail to mention that the
honor of inaugurating the system of
rural mail delivery is due to a bright
and intellectual son of the Empire
State of the South, and while many
are falsely claiming this honor, the
records of Congress prove beyond a
shadow of a doubt that the Hon.
Thomas E. Watson first secured an
appropriation for this purpose, and
for one I glory in the fact that no
power can rob him of this bright
laurel that adorns his brow.
Tn conclusion, allow me to say
that I hope that this system will
grow until every citizen’s mail will
be delivered to him and that each
and all of us will feel that this is a
Government by the people and for
the people and that we will praise it
in time of peace and fight for its
preservation and perpetuation in
time of war. In behalf of the mayor
and councilmen I now present you
with the keys of the city, and wfth
them our best wishes for your future
success and happiness.
some of us know is “on fire” for the
cause of humanity.
Your Mission evidence will burn
its way into the hearts of most peo
ple who are not narrow. There is
no hope for fanatics.
We will pray for you and your
work as best we know how. Surely,
surely, it has the stamp of God’s
own approval upon it.
We can’t tell what the result will
be. It may be as hard to change the
policy of some of our churches as it
would be to change the present pol
icy of our Government, or the tariff.
Yet, we have hopes.
Preach on; you are not by your
self.
Cordially and earnestly,
J. A. SMITH.
Lawrenceville, Ga., May 26, 1909.
