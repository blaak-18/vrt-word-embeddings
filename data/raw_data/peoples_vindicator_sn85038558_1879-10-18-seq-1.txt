I'll smooth you free of crease and fold,
And lay you tenderly away.
But ere I hide you from my sight
Forgetting all that's past and gone
Is Let me recall the visions brigh
I saw when first I drew you on.
I saw a nation spring to breath,
d- I saw a people proud and grand,
Do battle to the very death
For freedom and their native land.

d And as its splendor blaued on high
Fade like the fancies of a dream.
e. Then darkness suech as might be felt
ig Came down upon our hapless land, .
s, And let we knew our woe was dealt
ie In wisdom by a Father's hand.
Our Orcase is lost our opes are fled,
The land we loved sits sore bereft,
. Lamenting tor her glorious dead
You are the only vresage left.
n Gray clothes, I took you with pride
a- Such pride as manly hearts may take. 1

Enshrined within a human mould. ti

That moth and rust can o'er assail,
A diadem upon his brow A
To which earth's brightest crowns are

destruction by the ants, that will be m
