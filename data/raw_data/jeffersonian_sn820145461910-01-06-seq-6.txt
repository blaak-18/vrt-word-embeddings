I HAVE NOT LIED ABOUT THE
NEW REGISTRATION LAW.
My Dear Mr. Watson:—l have
been reading both of your Jefferson
ians for some little time, and take is
sue with you on every subject,—in
cluding Foreign Missions, Socialists
and Socialism, all; and I notice that
you don’t seem to be telling lies
about any of them. I read what you
said about the new Registration Law,
and thought you were telling the
truth also concerning it, but you will
notice from the inclosed clippings
from The Forest Blade, that you have
been telling pure lies about the new
law. Now, I believe what you said
about it, so you can use your own
pleasure concerning the clippings,
but I would love very much for you
to give us the real facts about this
business once more—get us out of
the dark, put us in the pure light
concerning the law.
Now, can we depend on this here
stuff in The Forest Blade? Can we
rely on the Atlanta Journal? Do
you suppose that you will ever want
to haul in voters from Alabama and
Tennessee, to carry a man to victory
that you may be fighting for? If not,
why does Mr. S. J. Tyson allude to
these things as he does?
Say, Tom, I heard a man say the
other day that you were going to get
a million of dollars to burst the
Farmers’ Union, is that so? I’m a
member of that grand and glorious
organization, and I believe you are
working as hard to see us fellows
prosper as any man under the sun.
How about it? Am I right?
I would thank you very much if
you will give us a hearing in your
Weekly concerning these things.
Very truly yours,
S. P. SMITH.
Rt. 4, Swainsboro, Ga.
Answer.
Certain crooks are running the
Farmers' Union in Georgia. They
have been bossing matters with a
high hand, and have got themselves
into an ugly scrape. Apparently
they have made some sort of secret
deal with Hon. Samuel Gompers,
President of the American Federa
tion of Labor. It w r as my duty as a
firm friend of the Farmers and of
their Union, to expose these rascals,
in order that they might be check
mated before it was too late. Os
course, they are resorting to the old
Livingston trick, claiming that I am
trying to destroy the Union. Such
talk is too silly to deceive a ten-year
old child.
Who is it that would pay me a mil
lion dollars to show up the rotten
ness of some of the Union City
bosses? Where is the man or cor
poration, or political party that
would bribe any editor to publish the
facts on Ladson, Boodle-hunter and
Duckpuddle? Those men amount to
nothing as individuals. It is their
power to mislead and betray the
Union w’hich renders them important
and dangerous. Who is it that would
hire me to prevent these traitors
from wrecking the Union? NOT ITS
ENEMIES, surely. The honest and
true members of the Farmers’ Union
are thanking me for putting them on
to facts which they did not know 7 , but
which they were entitled to know.
I’m not the least bit doubtful of
the results. John Lee and his lec
turers will lose out in that behind
closed-doors campaign. The people
of this State believe in a square deal,
and a fair tight—and they know that
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
the Union City leaders have adopted
THE TACTICS OF COWARDICE
AND GUILT.
As to the election law, I examined
the statute for myself, and what I
wrote about it was literally true. The
Act provides that the completed lists,
arranged in a definite way, shall be
filed with the Clerk, not later than
June sth; and not a single name can
be added or subtracted after that
date. The reference made by Hon.
Hoke Smith to the constitutional
amendment, is thoroughly mislead
ing. To have legal effect, that
amendment had to be acted on by the
Legislature, whose duty it was to pre
scribe how the citizen could get his
name on the voters book. When the
Legislature came to do this, it wil
fully or accidentally cut certain citi
zens out of their legal rights, by de
claring, in that new law, that no name
should be put on, or taken off, after
June sth.
With that law in force, how could
the young man, coming of age after
that, get himself registered?
And what legal right would the
election manager have to receive the
vote of any man whose name is not
on the lists?
The long and the short of it is, that
the Legislature deprived the citizen of
a right which the Constitutional
amendment gave him.
As to being afraid of Hon. Hoke
Smith —if his fool friends believe
that, let them trot him out, and we
will all see who it is that fears him.
THE SILVER QUESTION.
My Dear Sir: —I want to thank you
for your letter of the 10th inst. But
it’s me that has “caught you nap
ping.’’ You say: “I have, caught you
napping for once. I have had a good
deal to say about the phase of the sil
ver question to which you again call
my attention.”
I beg to differ from you, in the last
sentence especially. - In all your pub
lications, from 1905 up to the pres
ent, you have never once editorially
discussed the Silver Question from
the standpoint that I have been urg
ing you to take up, and which is quite
clearly, (but not fully,) presented in
the enclosed two articles.
In your June, 1909, number of
your Magazine, page 4 70, in replying
to a question of Ira V. Maxwell, you
did take up this phase of the silver
question, but that is the only time I
have seen anything direct from you
along that line, and have been sur
prised that you did not follow it up
along that line editorially, for, un
like free, unlimited 16 to 1, and the
quantitative theory which became an
old wornout saw, this phase of the
silver question to which I have so re
peatedly called your attention be
comes more and more interesting and
instructive the more it is discussed.
When the cotton crop of India is
normal or large your cotton producers
run up against a competition that -
seriously affects them, for the cost
of production in India is on a silver
basis. When the wheat crop of In
dia and Argentine is normal, or
large, our wheat-growers find them
selves affected in the same way. The
hardship of silver-standard people,
which constitute two-thirds of the
people of the world, in being forced
to put up two dollars of their money
to buy manufactured goods from us
and other gold-standard countries, is
forcing them to build their own
plants in all lines at an abnormal
rate. This competition will in the
neai' future SERIOUSLY affect our
< E>be 3effersonian
industries and all those engaged in
those industries, either as workers or
proprietors, and the entire commu
nities in which those industries have
been located. In fact, there are so
many important and interesting fea
tures to this phase of the silver ques
tion, that it never grows tiresome or
uninteresting—try it and see.
You, Mr. Watson, could do this
subject up brown if you would take it
up, and stick to the main features of
this phase of the silver question,
which is: Our trade and competition
with all Oriental and other silver
standard countries, and how the pres
ent low price of silver affects our
producers, manufacturers, exporters
and wage-workers.
Confine the discussion along these
lines, and you will find everybody
will become interested in it.
Begging your pardon for taking up
so much of your time, I am,
Very truly yours,
JAMES CONZETT.

Answer.
Brother Conzett thinks that The
Jeffersonian should devote more time
and space to one particular phase of
the money-question, while I believe
that it is wiser to treat the subject
in the manner w r hich must have be
come familiar to our readers.
In my judgment, India’s cotton
crop will never seriously menace our
natural monopoly; nor will the wheat,
corn, oats, hay and cattle of the sil
ver countries ever compete with ours.
So far as Chinese manufacturing
is concerned, I don’t intend to bother
my head about it. Most devoutly, I
wish that there wasn’t a single fac
tory in all these United States. China
can do all the spinning, if she can.
I don’t care a durn.
If we had never had any cotton and
woollen mills, we never would have
had so much sectional hatred, no

truth.
No, sirree! China may use her
cheap silver and produce cloth and
other stuff more cheaply than the
American capitalist can do it; and
she may thus undersell the American
manufacturer abroad, and take the
business away from him —but what
do I care?
The heartless and unpatriotic ras
cal, who on the slightest provocation
turns women and children into the
streets to perish of cold and hunger,
and who constantly sells his .cloth
and other stuff to China and other
foreign countries at lower figures
than he makes to us—need not ex
pect any sympathy from me, if India,
Japan and China take his foreign
trade away from him.
He has us 90,000,000 homefolks
penned securely within his damnable
tariff w r alls; and he annually ex
ploits us to the tune of more than
two thousand millions of dollars,
over and above 8 per cent, net
profits.
Let foreign countries run him out
of foreign markets, if they can. Why
should we have any belly-ache about
it?

Thos. E. Watson: —I note that you
intend to give the Catholic Church
an airing, and I feel assured that you
will handle the subject without
gloves, as that church has cursed
every country where it has had the

This State is controlled by the
Catholic vote, as it votes the Repub

Governor was nominated whose wife
was a Catholic, and Father York, of
San Francisco, gave notice- through
the press that he should support the
nominee. That was sufficient, and
he was elected. Taft and Roosevelt
