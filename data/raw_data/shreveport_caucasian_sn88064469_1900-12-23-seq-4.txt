In a reported Interview with a represer

Cleveland is represented as aayliae:
**In my opiolon the great need of the

fatally disorganiled, bet It sadly needs r -

What Is the matter wiLh the party?'

mas of Democratto voters saw this betore

"rhis te not Democracy," &ad relusedto

"As I &@e It, it is the duty of Demoorats

Washington, Dic. 22. --High officials
well versed in international law declare
that if Great Britain aicveit- the several
amiend<mnents proposed by the senate to
the Hay-Pancef te treatv. she will bhe
allied with the United States utinder thi
treaty to protcct the neutrality of the
Nicarignan canal in the event of its

Article 3 of the amnended convention
specitically provides that "the contract
ing governments, desiring to mainutain
and preserve the general priwiploe of
nrutralizition" established in the Clay
ton-Bulwir convention, adopt as the ba
&is of such neutralizatioin certain de
clared rules. Secretary Hay provided in
the treaty as originally submitted that
in order to maintain the neutralization
of the canal r!l powers should be re
quested to adhere to the convention, but
the senate in its desire to block the cou
struction of the canal, less it insult
friendly powers at the same time, struck
out this article and left to the United
States and Great Britain the preserva
tion of the neutrality of the waterway.
PROBATIONED FOR A DEED.
Maaly Art of a Judge In a Ditrelsing
<(a' at Boston.
Ce.. at Boston.
Boston, Dec. 22.-The most remarka
ble criminal case tried in Massarhusett8'
superior court in mainy years and which
aroused intense interest in the fashion
able Back Bay district, was ended Thurn.
day, when Judge Bond probationed Ma
rion Rogan, who had blinded for life
Dr. Frank L. Taylor, a dentist, by
throwing vitriol in his face out of re
venge for betrayal.
A young girl had earlier appeared be
fore the judge and told her pitiable story
and showed the whitehaired justioe her
littl4 babe, of whioh she cla imed Taylor
was the father. She said Taylor after
he had wrecked her life, told her he was
irruesistible among women by reason of
his good looks.
In announcing his decision Judge
Bond said that from the evidenoe it ap
peared Dr. Taylor had sought out Miss
Rogan, "knowing sie was a virtuous
woman, who had in no way wrouged
him, from the sole purpose of auusing
her ruin, and after he had aooomplished
it by fraud and deoeption and made use
of intoxioating liquors, if not by drugs,
he anteelingly cast her off withoat ~
sistanoe and advised her to resort to the
life of prostitution and even boasted of
his diagraceful oonduot with this young
woman and with others whom he had
ruined. Sph a maa is so vile that I
have no sympathy or pity for him in
his unfortunate oondition."
Judge Bond samid he regretted Mis
Rogan did not leave the p anishmpat of
her betrayer a higher power than her
self. As to the possibihty of similar
acts of personal vengeance would follow
probationing of this prisoner, Judge
Bond said such cases were so rare-none
other having come before him in the 40
years of his service on the bench-that
he would take the risk and order the re
lease of the prisoner n probation. *

At Bituch men were crucified and

Women were maltreated at Omrummwa

Men were done to death slowly by
