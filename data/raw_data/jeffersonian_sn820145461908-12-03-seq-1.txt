Summary of 'Ebents as They Happen
By Tom Dolan
Mayor Tom L. Johnson, of Cleve
land, Ohio, has lost his fortune owing
to his prolonged fight in the interests
of the people there. He will move his
family from their present magnificent
home on Euclid Avenue, into some un
pretentious little dwelling and start
over. But he is not at all grieved or’
cast down over the reverse, and de
clares himself in the fight to stay.

With the present progress it seems
that the Panama canal will be com
pleted in two years. The work for
October this year showed a consider
able improvement in distance over
that of last October. This work
was begun on May 1, 1904. The to
tal excavation has been upwards of
53,000,000 and the estimated number
of yards that would be necessary to
dig was 142,000,000. If this estimate
was correct, there is yet to be dug
86,000,000 yards and at the rate they
have been digging it will take two
years yet, though no one expects the
entire canal to be completed in any
thing like so short a time.
The third Russian Douma is now in
session and it is hoped that it will
prove of considerable service to the
country. The principal questions
now in consideration relate to the
different phases of the Balkan situa
tion.
Just after the recent panic started
in 1907, it was observed that for
eign immigration largely decreased
and that a number of emigrants left
this country. It is stated that the
tide is turning again this way, as
prospects have been held out of
brighter times. Be that as it mav,
however, the parasites who arrive in
droves only to sap the life-blood of
American labor should be compelled
to stand at the foot of the line. Thou
sands, indeed, have no intention to
labor. They merely engage in some
such enterprise as peddling, scrape
what money they can get together,
and leave just so soon as they get
enough to carry them back home in
good financial shape, or until depres
sion here induces them to hasten their
departure. In no case do they work
other than an industrial harm.
The Shah of Persia attempted re
cently to renig on the Constitution
“granted” to his subjects, but later
reports show that he was persuaded to
repent of his saucy proclamation
against the Constitution, and is now
anxious to reinstate himself in the
good graces, not only of his subjects,

but of the British and Russian lega
tions. It is queer, very, how Eng
land can step in and help the Per
sian under dog to get some form of
self-government, but cannot see any
thing in the same desire on the part
of her own subjects in India save
sedition, rebellion and mischief gen
erally. Likewise Russia in the atti
tude of friend to liberty is enough
to make the gods weep.
An appeal has been made for an
investigation into the affairs of the
United States Express Company and
for legislation that will permit a ma
jority of the stockholders to partici
pate in its management. It is stated
that, while the stockholders have
all due liability, they have no voice
in the direction of the affairs of the
concern. It is further shown that
Sen. T. C. Platt, as president, re
ceives $25,000 a year and that over
double that amount goes to other
members of the Platt Express Com
pany dynasty. Eugene G. Kramer,
counsel for the objecting stockhold
ers, briefly states their claims and
grievances as follows:
“We want the same protection
against spoliation that the law affords
stock corporations. Seven men, own
ing only 500 shares in the United
States Express Company, one-half
of one per cent of its capital, control
its affairs, decline to call annual
meetings of the stockholders and op
pose all efforts of shareholders to
bring about the election of a new di
rectorate.”
The public has small occasion to be
distressed over the happenings to any
of the stockholders of the express
monopoly, but any measures that may
be taken toward curbing the rapacity
of the odious Tom Platt and his gang
are welcome.

Now, is it possible that, after a fu
rore that has swept over the wide,
wide world about the Kaiser’s “in
terview,” it is to be altogether
denied 1 ? And will anybody believe
the denial?
In an address at the banquet of the
Rotary Club, in 'San Francisco, Chas.
M. Schwab, of the Steel Trust, is
quoted as saying:
“Never again will any sane, con
servative business man build a ship
here until the labor situation has ma
terially changed. The cost of labor
in this city is twice as much as in
any of the Eastern cities, not so
much because of the wage paid, but
because of the amount and the qual-

ity of the work performed. I lost
$3,000,000 here in one year because
of the attitude of union labor.
“Only concerted action by all the
merchants involved, persistent and
unremitting, will relieve the situation.
Until that is done, San Francisco
will not assume the position that is
rightfully hers in the commercial
world. And when it is done I shall
be willing to risk my dollars here
with many other Eastern capitalists.”
How rebuked Californians should
feel! Their antipathy to Chinese
Coolie labor, and their lack of Euro
pean pauper labor militates severely
against the State in the eyes of such
fair-minded and liberal spirited pa
triots as Mr. Schwab and his ilk.
Tang Shae Yi, Chinese envoy of
princely rank, has lately arrived in
iSan Francisco on his way to Wash
ington, bearing message of gratitude
to the United States for remission of
$14,000,000, its share of the burden
placed upon the Chinese government
by the foreign powers immediately
after the Boxer insurrection.
Prince Ching, president of the For
eign Board of China, has sent to the
United States a letter detailing the
deaths of the late Emperor and Em
press and asking for friendly rela
tions between the two governments.
China’s present “ruler” is tiny
Prince Pu Yi, who has been taken
from his own family to be brought up
in the royal palace, which is said to
resound with his wailings for his old
nurse. Poor little Emperor!
Japan has given semi-official assur
ance that she will not try to seize
upon the present opportunity, af
forded by the unsettled condition of
China, to take undue advantage of
the situation in that country.
John D. Rockefeller, the benevolent
old Sunday school teacher with whose
gentle methods we are all familiar,
and the recently elected-to-the-spot
light John D. Archbold, are on the
grid in New York, where suit is
being prosecuted to dissolve the
Standard Oil Company.
Sylvester G. Williams, of Denver,
Colorado, will soon begin a case some
what similar to that against the
(Standard Oil Company involving the
Harriman lines of railroad, in an ef
fort to disrupt the merger existing.
Mr. Williams is special examiner for
the United States Court. Testimony
will be taken in New York City.
Simon Guggenheim will be the on
ly Republican member of Congress
from the State of Colorado. This
makes him supreme dictator of that
State and arbiter of. the political fate ,
of its citizens, so far as patronage
and appointive positions are con
cerned. If Colorado could be in a
worse fix than under the heel of a
Guggenheim, one wonders what it
could be.
President Cabrera, of Guatemala,
fears his government may be fined
$2,000,000 by the Central American
Court of Justice for alleged complic
ity in the revolutions in Nicaragua
and Honduras.
Another insurrection has broken
out in Hayti. It is reported that
General Simon, former commander of
the troops in the southern depart
ment, has seized the city of Las
Cayes and surrounding country. The
Government troops are surrounded by
the rebels. Hayti is simply begging
to be wiped off the earth by earth
quake, pestilence or an aroused civili
zation. Under black domination it
steadily grows viler.
The Premier Diamond Mining
Company has just paid over to the
government of the Transvaal the sum
of $1,300,000 as its share of the prof
its for the fiscal year ending Novem
ber first. What a howl would go up
from any of our great mining con
cerns, or other corporations having
“vested rights” if any similar trib
ute had to be paid to the support of
the government under which their
enormous privileges and profits were
possible.
A new form of foot and mouth dis
ease among cattle, which is epidemic
is New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland
and Michigan and probably other
states, will probably cause a loss of
millions of dollars. Incidentally, the
price of beef may be expected to take
a rise.
On November 15, after a probation
ary period of two years, Cuba elected
a president in the person of Jose M.
Gomez. The third American occupa
tion will end with his inauguration.
It is stated that the famous Nobel
prize in physics will be awarded to
William Marconi, of “wireless teleg
raphy ’ ’ achievements.
