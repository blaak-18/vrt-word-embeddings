OT INTEREST TO WEALTH PRODUCERS
THE RACE PROBLEM.
The race problem has been dis
cussed and cussed but so far there has
never been any solution that has been
practicable or brought about the
desired result. The only correct and
satisfactory solution to this problem
which is a. terrible octopus in the
South is THE ABOLITION OF THE
“SERVICE PAN.”
When the white people of the South
get together and say, and mean it,
that no servant shall carry anything
cooked or raw from their kitchens,
and when they stop it, then, and not
till then, will we have a solution to
the race problem and the labor situa
tion in the South.
If there is any one thing the negro
must have it is something to eat, and
plenty of it. We don’t object to his
having it but we want him to work
for it as we do.
The solution of this problem rests
with the southern housewife. The
good women of the South contributed
as much support to the Confederate
army as any man in it, and they are
still stirred by the same patriotic
spirit and heroism that marked them
as the most sacrificing women of the
world. It rests with our women,
women who are the daughters of a
mother who walked to the gate and
hade father goodbye and then the
oldest son and then the next and on
down till at last she mended the thin
home-made jeans pants of the little
sixteen year old boy and led him to
the gate and said: “Go, my boy and
may God bless you, go to the front
and do all you can for our down
trodden southland,” and turned from
that gate, glad that she could make
such a sacrifice and lay it upon
the altar of what she believed to be
right.
Yes, we are daughters of those
women and it rests with us to solve
this problem. If we are able to
employ a cook (for it is an expensive
luxury) go with her to your pantry
and stay with her while she cooks the
first meal and show her how many
biscuits a quart of flour will make,.,
cut and measure everything, and let
her know that you are the mistress of
the situation, and that you are not
going to suffer your husband to go to
work from early mom, and in the
winter before day, and stay at it till
after dark, while she feeds a half
dozen negro men in an alley, when
the fields are white unto harvest and
the laborers so few. This morning I
lead a letter from an old man 75 years
of age, with a comfortable bank ac
count, and he said he was stopping
as a boarder in a home on the farm,
and on account of the scarcity of
negroes to pick cotton, he was picking
cotton every day with that family.
Housekeeper, is it not time to call
a halt ? With every alley and thor
oughfare filled with idle negroes who
can go and do what you cannot —
go to the . ballot box and
become a factoi’ in the govern
ment of our fair land, then
return at dinner time, and meet your
cook with a “Service Pan” from your
kitchen filled (not with scraps) but
the most choice morsels from your
larder.
Near Macon is a fashionable sub-,
urb recently built up and the wives
and housekeepers took a stand that no
servant should carry a “service pan”
from their premises and the negroes
immediately boycotted them, but they
are standing firm and we trust that
they •will go down in history as the
women who set up a precedent to
bring about the most needed reform
and settled the labor problem. Let
all the good women of the city get
together on this subject and run the
idle negro to the farm where his labor
is so much needed.
If our women could be aroused and
a spirit of patriotism be stirred in
their hearts, they would feel the
burden light, and be willing to lay
aside some of the frivolous indul
gences and take a stand and teach the
negro a lesson.
The wife of the farmer is already
doing her part and doing it under the
mose adverse circumstances. Some of
them have to carry water from a
spring and up a hill, and go hundreds
of yards to the cow pen to milk with
every other duty just as inconvenient
and difficult, and many are going to
the fields and taking their children
and doing the work that these loafing
negroes should be doing. The idle ne
gro is not in the country but is hous
ed and fed by the city. Let the women
of our cities put out the “service
pan.” We have every modern conve
nience, gas stoves water in the kitch
en, latest improved cooking utensels,
comfortable houses, with the baker at
our door and the telephone
to call the butcher or to
have a chicken or fish ordered
dressed and prepared ready to cook,
and then if we are indisposed or want
a rest we can send to the restaurant
or buy things already cooked (and we
eat more than we need anyway, and
would live longer if we ate less).Let
us look the situation squarely in the
face and bestir ourselves to bring a
bout this solution.
In conclusion let me say a word to
our next Legislature. You can pass a
bill to be placed on the Statute of
Georgia making it a felony, and if not
a felony, then a misdemeanor, for any
negro to carry a “service pan,” this
law is necessary for the protection of
the frail women who feel that they
are helpless victims of these cooks.
Some will say that this is not consti
tutional, but we have to do some
things which do not entirely accord
•with the 15th Amendment, and while
it may not be constitutional, it is aw
fully convenient, and with a few
more riots like Springfield, in other
sections of the country, we ,need not
fear about the constitutionality of the
law. We have fed them long enough.
Let us cut out the “service pan.”

CONCRETE ON THE FARM.
City folk do not know to what ex
tent concrete is used on the farm.
Virginia farmers are a little slow in
getting at its use, but in the middle
West concrete is rapidly tak
ing the place- of timber con
struction. Concrete is used to
build poultry houses, pig pens, silos,
well-curbs, kennels, cisterns, feeding
floors, water tanks, root cellars, water
troughs, feed troughs, fence posts, vine
props, besides walks and driveways,
drain tile and pipe, and culverts. In
addition many concrete dwelling hous
es are going up on the farm, together
with concrete barns and stables.
Cement construction is more dura
ble than timber, is easily kept in
sanitary condition, and presents a
cetter appearance.
It is a fact that the
American farmer,, as a class,
has never been impressed with
the value of permanent construc
tion of his buildings, which, aside
from the dwelling house, sometimes
r rely last through a single genera
tion. In Europe, notably France, trav
elers from America always comment
on the permanent character of the
improvements on the small farm. The
father hands down to' the son an en
during, permanent homestead. The
buildings are inexpensive to keep up,
and to this fact is attnouted in part
the . gricultural wealth of the French
peasant. His profits on his crops,
though they may appear small, are net
and the money doesn’t go to main
tain flmsy improvements.
Concrete —a mixture principally of
cement and sand —is susceptible of
such a variety of uses, that it is sur
prising that Virginia farmers have
not realized the advantages of its use.
By beginning work in concrete, with
only himself and his ordinary farm
help, a farmer can at comparatively
small expense in a few years trans
form his place by substituting and re
placing frame buildings with struc
tures that will endure after he has
gone and his sons have taken his
p1 ace. —R i c hmon d Journal.
HOW TO FARM WITHOUT LIENS
OR MORTGAGES.
Messrs. Editors: I have been
smoked out of my winks by some ar
ticles recently appearing in your pa
per in reply to which I wish to say a
few words. When you advocate rais
ing more corn, I think, in a sense, the
key-note has been struck.
How any man can think of being
free and independent as a strictly
cotton farmer, I can’t see. It seems
to me that such a curse will bring
almost any farmer into bondage. He
would not know in spring what it
would cost him for feed to keep his
stock on during the year, neither
would he know what his cotton —
should he make a good crop —would
be worth. Cotton may be low, what
lie has to buy may be high. Don’t
you think he is running a big risk?
Can any one Jell me why corn made
at home is not worth as much to him
to feed when it will not bring more
than forty cents per bushel as if he
had to pay one dollar per bushel?
As to the hog problem, I know we
can make our own meat; and, be
sides, we can have good lard made
at home to make good biscuit. When
we have to depend on the market, we
may not get what is good. I only
claim to be a back number, an old
■Confederate soldier in my seventieth
year, of course in my dotage; but I
still remember some things that can
be done. I have never been an all
cotton planter; but farm on a small
scale, raising my meat, corn, cows,
horses an(l mules, some goats and
sheep; never made a mortgage in my
life, and have said I would make one
crop on bread and water before I
would secure a man for his money
and let him say what I and my family
shall have. Getting yourself in a
condition so he can say that is pretty
tough, don’t you think? But I have
made a success in managing a small
business and a small farm. I will
say that my opinion is that each man
must have some plan of his own in
order to succeed. Let me tell you,
brother farmer, you must not depend
on other men to bring success to
your business.
A few words in regard to the Far
mers’ Union: Keep out of debt, and
yours will be success. Your princi
ples are about right, as I understand
them, if you will make at home the
principal part of what you need. But
I can’t see how you can expect to
succeed and still plant cotton to pay
indebtedness on said crop. Don’t
you suppose the speculator and man
ufacturer have as much sense as we
farmers have? Would you, brother
farmer, pay fifteen cents for cotton
when you could get it at ten or
twelve? Would that be business?
Sav ?
I am not connected with the Far
mers’ Union, but I think I practice
what you advocate in principle. I
am one who holds some little cotton
every year. But some will say that
“You are able to do your way.” Do
you know how came me able to do
so? Simply by doing as I have tried
to show you, raise as nearly as pos
sible what is needed at home.
Can any man make you give a
lien on what you have if you have
plenty of everything at home? I
know that you can do what I do, if
you will put your mind in that direc
tion; but it takes more than a mere
desire to do these things. Do you go
to town without making an effort to
do so? As I did not intend to write
so much, I will close, though I have
not told half that I think I see in
our agricultural field. “BACK NUM
