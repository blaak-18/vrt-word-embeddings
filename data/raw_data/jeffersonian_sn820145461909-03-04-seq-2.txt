LET SOMETHING GOOD BE SAID.
\
When over the fair fame of friend or *
foe ‘
The shadow of disgrace shall fall
instead
Os words of blame or proof of thus
and so,
Let something good be said.
Forget not that no fellow-being yet
May fall so low but love may lift
his head,
Even the cheek of shame with tears
is wet,
If something good be said.
i
No generous heart may vainly turn
aside
In ways of sympathy, no soul so
dead
But may awaken strong and glorified,
Is something good be said.
And so I charge ye, by the thorny
crown,
And by the cross on which the
Saviour bled,
And by your own soul’s hope of fair
renown, .
Let something good be said.
—James Whitcomb Riley.
AS TO NIGHTRIDERS.
1 know you will permit me to de
fend my people through the medium
of the Weekly Jeffersonian.
To begin with, I will state that I
have been on the same tobacco farm
near Port Royal, Tenn., since 1855 —
right in the very heart of the “Black
Patch,” the largest tobacco growing
section on the face of the earth. From
this you will see that I am bound
to be familiar with real conditions
here.
It was in my immediate section
that, in 1904, we farmers organized
the “Tobacco Growers Protective As
sociation” to fight the hellish Tobacco
Trust. The Trust concocted a diaboli
cal plot and scheme to rob us of our
homes and liberty, and strove, with all
its might and main, to blightearth’s
fairest land.
All that rescued and redeemed our
country from the remorseless grip of
the despoilers hand was the desperate
fight we made. Driven to desperation,
wig struck back blow for blow. When
the fight was hot, certain vile sheets
in the North sent reporters here to
write up “The Tobacco War.” Our
people, thinking they would give both
sides of the fight, treated the Yan
kees courteously. But when they re
turned to the North, the cowardly curs
printed sheet after sheet of the vilest
lies and slander about us. We then
wrote our side of the question and
sent it with a courteous request that
it be printed. We met with a flat re
fusal. Then a bank check was sent
with the request that it be inserted at
regular advertising rates, and we were
turned down again. We then saw
through the whole trick —hirelings
sent here by the Tobacco Trust to
publish us to the world as a band
of lawless “Night Riders,” outlaws
and cut-throats, refusing to give us
a chance to defend ourselves.
Then the next reporter to come here
was one Don Marquis, of the Uncle
Remus Magazine, Atlanta, Ga. The
very fact that the magazine Ysferred
to was founded by the laL ' Joel
Chandler Harris, one of the South’s
most gifted sons, made us think its
reporter would treat us fairly by giv
ing both sides of the fight. But when
Don Marquis returned to Atlanta, he
wrote the biggest pack of lies and the
vilest slander on our people ever put
in print. Then in the last (?) issue
of the magazine referred to he comes
back at us again, and repeats his lies
and then sails into you become you
have taken sides with us, “We
farmers,” who have espoused the
noblest and holiest cause since Ameri
can patriots, inspired by the love of
liberty and country, fought so valiant
ly on the blood-stain heights of Bunk
er Hill, and after a long, fierce and
bloody struggle, triumphed so glori
ously at Yorktown.
Don Marquis charges that ours is a
ruined and bursted county, a land of
not and murder; and goes on to stat 1
That, in consequence, thousands of
good people have been di*iven from
their homes and that the price of
farms has gone down and dowfi, en
tailing, in the aggregate, a loss of mil
lions of dollars. As a matter of fact,
farms that were offered for sale at
S2O and $25 per acre in 1903 (one year
before we organized) would sell for
more than double that now. I can
send you the advertisements of a local
real estate firm that quotes farms as
high as SIOO per acre. Then the books
of our county register show that thous
ands of farm mortgages have Jbeen
paid off, and the books of our county
trustees show that the people are pay
ing their taxes promptly, and the
sheriff’s books show that he is making
but few, if any, land sales for taxes.
When the hellish tobacco trust had
us down with its cruel iron heel dig
ging in our necks, our sheriff had to
keep the papers filled with land sale
advertisements for taxes —the people
were not able to raise the money by
the time set by law.
Then go to the local banks and look
at their books. You will learn that
hundreds of farmers who were com
pelled to over-draw their accounts in
trust times have paid up and have
to their credit. And mer
chants, and all other classes of busi
ness men, will tell you that trade is
much better. Ask wage workers and
you will be told a tale of better times.
During the busy season of cutting
and curing tobacco, some planters pay
common field hands wages that range
from $1.50 to $2.50 per day to cut to
bacco. When the Tobacco Trust was
in the saddle, the same people begged
work at forty and fifty cents per
day.'
All any one will have to do to see
that every word I have written is as
true as Holy Writ is to come here.
If The Jeffersonian were to send a re
porter here, I know we would get fair
treatment, nor would we have to send
a bank check to hire it to let us tell
(he truth. What that imported Yan
kee, Don Marquis, wrote about us was
enough to make Joel Chandler Harris
turn over in his grave,—he who stood
ever ready to defend the people of
his native Southland. No doubt the
writer referred to is of the Yankee
breed who love the strains of “March
ing Through Georgia” better than
Jeffersonian
they do “Dixie.” He may be a direct
descendant of some of old Sherman’s
vandals who left a trail of blood and
death and smoking ruins every inch
of the way from Atlanta to Columbia.
Yours truly,
W. L. Parks.

. RURAL FREE DELIVERIES.
Next in importance to first-class
roads in banishing the blighting curse
of Isolation from rural districts every
where is the rural free deliveries of the
mails. When Hon. Thomas E. Watson
first called the attention of the U. S.
Congress to the fact that it was cheap
er to send a man on a mule to deliver
the mails to forty farmers than it was
for forty farmers to send to the post
office for their mail, nobody dreamed
that his suggestion would so soon ma
terialize into one of the greatest edu
cational agencies of the age. And not
only is it a great educational agency
within itself, but is constantly cre
ating a demand for other wholesome
and beneficent agencies, such as bet
ter roads, rural telephones, etc., etc.
Very few of us have realized either
the extent to which the R. F. D. sys
tem has been developed or the mani
fold benefits that it brings daily to
the country. It has quickly developed
from an expensive luxury to an eco
nomical necessity, and yet it has been
but little over a dozen years since Mr.
Watson made the significant remark
in the U. S. Congress.
Statistics of the system would stag
ger the mind, but we may at least call
attention to the fact that there are
now in Georgia alone fifteen hundred
R. F. D.’s., covering daily a distance
of thirty-five thousand miles, and de
livering something like seven to eight
million pieces of mail per month. And
yet Georgia has not been given her
share of the R. F. D.’s.
—The Ishmaelite.
ROOSEVELT AND CRUM.
Roosevelt persists in forcing ne
groes on the South. The negro Crum,
whose appointment as collector at
Charleston has been held up by the
senate for several years, is still being
pressed by him; and yet there are
those in the South who continue to
laud him to the skies. —Carroll Coun
ty Times.
AMENDE HONORABLE.
Mr. Thomas E. Watson, in his
Weekly Jeffersonian, protests to The
Washington Herald, with earnestness
and courtesy alike convincing, that he
was in no wise seeking to “belittle,”
or “sneeringly allude to,” Abraham
Lincoln in a magazine article noted;
stating that it was his object merely
to dissent from the, to him, apparent
ly growing idea that “Mr. Lincoln
was the greatest man in the world.”
We confess that we read a somewhat
broader meaning into Mr. Watson’s
article —or, perhaps, we should say
narrower—and amid the universal
kindliness of Lincoln expression in
cident to the celebration of his birth
day, Mr. Watson’s summing up of the
martyred President carried, to our
mind, a distinctly jarring, note. But if
Mr. Watson says he did not mean it
that way, he did not —and that is
all there is to that! We have fre
quently expressed our honest admira
tion for Mr. Watson’s splendid
“Story of France,” and if he should
ever be moved to write a “Story of
Lincoln,” we are satisfied it would
have a wide reading—and it would,
therefore, be little short of a calamity
for Mr. Watson to get a wrong point
of view. We do not say he will; we
do not say he is even likely to, but
we do say we hope he will not. —

DIFFERENT THING.
Three years ago when Hoke Smith
was running for governor of Georgia
and was being supported by the third
party almost to a man, the members
of that organization were fairly re
spectable people. The anti-Smith
crowd were too decent to throw mud.
But as soon as the tide was turned,
why that was a different thing. The
third party folks were mighty wicked
people that nobody could agree with.
In last week’s issue of the Jeffer
sonian the editor states that in New
York City the national government
owns a building, or at least did own
one until a government official sold
it to Rockefeller, but that gentleman
never paid a cent for it and is now
collecting rent from the government
for that building. The city of New
York has tried to collect taxes on the ■
property but cannot because John D.
says he does not own it.
Now, this is a very small matter
compared to the Pacific railroad steal,
but why should we submit to any
such 1 ? If the statements are not true
we should refute them. If they are
true we should see that these evils are
corrected regardless of the fact of
who points them out.
Strange that our people will suffer
such impositions and laud to the skies
the perpetrators.
We all can’t be the favored, but per
haps we hope to be, so we condemn
the fellow who points out these wick
ednesses. We might possibly get an
opportunity of being one of the ins.
Let us suppose that we were one of
the original stockholders of the Cen
tral railroad that the looters of
that magnificent piece of proper
ty ousted and robbed of our interest,
how would we feel towards the fellow
who points out the infamy? That
would be a different thing.
Surely a people who profess to be
Christians and sane beings will not
perpetuate such conditions. If we
have no respect for our own genera
tion we should have some thought of
the people who live after us. —Inter-
State Herald.
FATE.
A waste of lonely waters without a
shore, ,
Wide, burning desert sands;
Grim giants that you meet
With helpless, shackled hands;
Deep pitfalls for blind feet;
The sphinx who sits in silence, and be
fore,
Straight in your path, the awful cy
clone’s roar.
MARY CHAPIN SMITH.
