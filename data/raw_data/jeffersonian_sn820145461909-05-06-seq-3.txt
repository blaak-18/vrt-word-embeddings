Monterey is surrounded by lofty
mountains in the shape of a horse
shoe with the heel to the north-east.
It is a busy place of 100,000 inhabi
tants. It’s rolling mills turn out
steel rails and all kinds of steel and
iron work. It has large reduction
works for the copper, zinc, lead and
silver ores which are Mined from the
near-by mountains. Large quantities
of as fine peaches as men ever ate are
canned here.
When you get off at the depot,
looking south, down a straight street
to the mountains, they look only a
short distance off, but they are eight
miles away; looking west, you see
them apparently not over one and a
half miles. They are fifteen miles.
Looking east is Saddle Mountain,
seemingly a half-hour’s walk; it is
seven miles to its base. Street-car
fare is from 5 to 10 cents Mexican
money. If you sit in front, first class,
it is 10 cents, in rear seats it is 5
cents. You get off and on the cars
from the center of the car.
Hotel accommodations are good.
Hot and cold water and electric light
in each room. Rooms from $2 to $5
Mexican money. There are some fine
buildings. Americans are interested
in the Bishop’s Palace and others
famous in the siege of the city by
Gen. Taylor.
We leave on Mexican Central at
7 A. M., passing out of the city to
the east, rounding Saddle Mountain,
we take our way to the south-east for
Tampico, 322 miles away. The Coun
try is rocky and poor on the line of
the road, occasional valleys and irri
gated fields. To our right looms up
lofty mountains, fifteen to fifty miles
away, with green patches in the val
leys at their bases, caused by springs.
To the eye they look inaccessible, but
an intelligent Mexican informs us
that on top there are forests of large
trees, principally pine, with plenty
of springs of fine water, and many
small farms, with orchards of apples,
pears, peaches and our temperate-zone
fruits of all kinds.
At Montemorelos, a place of about
5,000, we come to the first orange
grove (they call orchards groves), and
sugar plantations. All under irriga
tion from the Pilan River, a small
stream rushing out of the mountains
to the west. Here we lose sight of
Saddle Mountain, fifty-five miles
away, shut out by lofty hills. On
either side of the line there are vil
lages and haciendas on every stream
that affords irrigation, otherwise the
country is a barren waste. The view
to the west is grand, mountain piled
upon mountain, until their tops ap
pear far above the clouds, and so far
away that they seem to be so steep
as if standing upon edge, the sun shin
ing through the immense gorges (bar
rancas). With aid of a glass we can
see the trees upon their tops.
We reach Victoria, the capital of
the state of Tamalipas, about 3 P. M.
It is a city of ten thousand, and all
of them are at the depot, acres of
them, as thick as they can stand, with
loads of flowers, but the flowers are
not for us, they are wasting them
upon a Catholic bishop and two
priests that came down on the train
MEXICO
with us. The bishop and one priest
second class, unbeknown to us. They
gather the old fat bishop up on their
shoulders, he is smiling, but you can
see he wants to get down. As far as
the crowd can throw they are pelting
him with flowers. Such shouting and
laughing, dancing', every man, woman
and child making all the noise they
can. At last they get him to a car
riage, hike him in and march away,
their voices sounding like a roar of
many waters until after lost to view.
Leaving Victoria the country be
comes more barren, until we reach
Escandon. A few miles to the west
of this place there is an American
colony, and from here on to Tampico
there are a number of American set
tlements. Just west of the next town,
Arguelles, a Mr. Greer has a young
orange grove of 2,000 acres which he
irrigates from the Tamesi River, a
considerable stream. Now we have
trouble, the engine of a freight train
is off at a switch, so we can’t get by.
It takes two hours to move it so we
can pass, and we have to push the
freight train train ahead of us to
Gonzales, 43 miles, before we can
pass. Darkness shuts us out. We
arrive at Tampico at midnight, tired
and weary.
We breakfast late, but when we
get out and find the posit office we
are too early to get mail, so we hunt
up friends and find letters from home
in their care, which we read, and for
an hour we engage in writing back.
Tampico has about 30,000 people.
It lies on a ridge that extends south
between the Tamesi and lake Car
pintero to the Panuco River (pro
nounced Pah-nu-co’h). This ridge is
less than a half-mile w’ide and about
one and one-fourth miles long. It is
seven miles from the gulf. The Panu
co is about 500 yards wide and sixty
teet deep. There are large jetties at
the mouth of the river, 1,000 feet
apart iand extending 7,000 feet into
the gulf. There is forty-five feet of
water where the bar was and up the
river for 20 miles from its mouth
there is over fifty feet of water. To
the west of Tampico is the Tamesi
River and the salt-water lake of
Chairel, about 5 by 4 miles. To the
south is Lake Puebla Viejo, or Old
Town Lake, also salt, about 5 by 10
miles. On the south of the mouth of
the river, one and one-half miles from
the gulf is an elevation perhaps 150
feet by 2 to 3 miles wide, extending
to nearly the edge of Lake Puebla
Viejo (Old Tow r n Lake), and south
to the next river. The view from the
top of this hill is beautiful; to the
east lies the gulf, to the south and
south-west Old Town Lake with the
green surrounding woods, low hills
appearing in the distance, west the
winding Panuco, and north and north
west the city and Lake Chairel. Two
miles from Tampico is a famous Aztec
spring that flows out of a hillside
about 50 feet above sea level. It is
dug out and walled in with cement.
When the Spaniards found it they
cut into it looking for treasure. The
Indians cemented the broken wall up,
but the broken wall looks new to the
old one, yet it is over 380 years since
the repair was made. The Aztecs did
Jeffersonian
not know who, or when the original
work was done. Probably by that
race that built the ruined cities of
Mexico, have left these “footprints
on the sands of time.” I saw some
hideous stone idols that were “dug
up” on some islands near Tampico.
The buried city at ithe foot of the
mountains between Tampico and Vera
Cruz, found last year, is expected
to add much to the wonders of the
ancient cities of old Mexico.
The city of Tampico has filled up
all the swamps and low places around
it with gravel iand sand at a cost of
several millions. The 'high land is
now nearly all occupied, and to ex
tend the city it will be necessary to
fill in the salt-water lakes that con
fine it to the present limits.
This country appears to be under
laid with oil. The Waters Pierce
Oil Company has immense refineries
at Tampico. Their rivals, the Pear
sons of London, operating from Tex
pau (pronounced Toothpau), have also
large interests, as well as two Mexican
companies. All of them are getting
all the leases they can. I met up with
two men locating oil land for the
Southern Pacific railroad (Harriman).
They told me they had bought for
that road so far 150,000 acres of oil
lands. They have an outfit of wagons,
hacks and Mexicans, and are going
over the country quietly locating and
buying all the best locations they can.
As the Waters Pierce Oil Company is
a Standard company, it looks like
Hamman at some future time in
tends to squeeze the Rockefeller-
Morgan crowd. Anyway the Harri
man interests are very active in that
country and this probably accounts
for the hostility of Hill and Harri
man for the control of the South
Texas gateway to Mexico. The gen
tleman in charge of tdie Harriman in
terests told me that the oil field ex
tends from way below Vera Cruz,
Mexico, to Corsicana, Texas, and calls
it the Corsicana field. It is of enor
mous extent. The panier oil is in
large pockets, Ebano and Los Bocas,
thirty miles north of Tampico. The
new well only furnishes 15 barrels.
They are now boring 20 miles farther
west, on the Tamesi. The wells at
Ebano furnish nearly all the oil used
by the Mexican Central roads, who
use oil-burning engines for their
roads.
The country is being colonized by
Americans. They are buying up de
sirable large ranches iand dividing
them up and colonizing them. Four
years ago a small party bought the
Atascador, a ranch of 191,000 acres,
for 40 cents per acre. It is a very
fine body of farming land. They
have cut it up, and are selling it out
from $7.50 to S2O per acre. They
have quite a colony of Americans im
proving the lands. Over 300 persons
have bought land there. They raise
all the citrous fruits, coffee, pine
apples, bananas, corn, cotton, sugar
cane, all the garden vegetables we
grow, the year round, giving employ
ment to hundreds of Mexican labor
ers, with whom the Americans are
•popular, having raised the wages from
about 20 cents to 40 cents per day,
