LITTLE DISER.
(Continued from Page Three.)
to say I wuz mad at y.ou, I’d hit him
then an’ thar.”
“ ’Cause I couldn’t he’p bein’ a
gal, could I?”
“No, honey, an’ I am glad you air
a gal. I didn’t think it wuz possible
fur me to love anybody as much as I
do you.”
“An’ mamma, toot”
“Yes, an’ her too.”
The poor, overworked woman seem
ed younger after this, and the songs
whieh she sang at evening were of
more cheerful tune. Every one no
ticed the change in Mose’s character,
and neighbors who had, during many
years, avoided his society, now often
called upon him at evening and dis
cussed the Scripture while the whip
poorwills, among the branches of the
hickory trees, tuned their weird pipes.
The river being so low that boats
could not run, Mose was commissioned
to haul a wagon-load of flour from a
small town in an adjoining state to
the neighborhood in whieh he lived. It
would require several days to make
the trip, and the idea of such a jour
ney gave great anxiety to little Diser.
“I will bring you a great big doll,”
said Mose.
“Will you?” clapping her hands.
“Yes, a great big one.”
“An’ not made outen rags, either.”
“No; made outen —outen —blast me
if I know what they air made outen,
honey, but I know they ain’t made
outen rags. I won’t be gone but fo’
days, an’ then, my gracious, what a
doll —whoopee—what a doll!”
The buying of a whole wagon-load
of flour was a mammoth transaction
in which Mose felt a keen pride, and
he stood about the door of the ware
house giving himself the airs of a
great speculator; but his greatest
pleasure was experienced when he pur
chased Diser’s doll.
“Jest wrap that up keerful as you
ken an’ put it in some sort o’ box,”
he said to the storekeeper.
“For your little girl, I reckon,”
the tradesman remarked.
“You hit it squar, sir; you hit it
perfeckly squar. You’ve hearn o’ an
gels, I reckon.”
“Oh, yes.”
“Wall, she’g one, whether thar ever
wuz any other ur not. She found me
one o’ the meanest an’ sinnin’est men
in the world, but es she hain’t come
mighty nigh makin’ a sort o’ saint
outen me I’ll Jac slathered and slam
med.”
“Tou love her a good deal, no
doubt,” said the tradesman, putting
the doll into a box.
“Look here,” said Mose, “es you
didn’t ’pear to be a putty good sort
o’ feller I’d pull out your nose long
enough to tie in a knot for sayin’
that I love her a good deal. W’y,
sir, it’s all I can do to keep from
drappin’ down on my knees an’ wor
shipin’ her.”
“Got any boys?”
“No, an’ don’t want none. All I
want is little Diser.”
“That’s her name?”
“Yes.”
“Sort of a curious name, ain’t it?”
“Wall, yes, I reckon it is to any
body that ain’t used to it. To tell you
the truth, I wanted a boy so bad that
when she wuz born I named her Dis
erp’intment. Arter I fell in love with
her—an’ that wa’n’t until she was a
good big gal—l wanted to change it,
but she tuck on so that I ’lowed that
‘Jeffersonian
I’d better let it stay jes’ as it wuz.
Wall, it’s about time I was startin’
out, fur unless the river has riz sence
I left, some folks is hankerin’ power
ful fur flour by this time.
When within about ten mdes of
home, Mose stopped at a crcss-roads
store to get a drink of wate~ 4 The
sun had just gone down behind the dis
tant bluffs on the river. When he
stepped into the store a loud shout
greeted him, and Andy Horn, Sam
Stoveall and the blacksmith pressed
forward and congratulated him upon
the success of his great journey.
“Tell us all about it, Mose,” said
the blacksmith.
“I would, boys; I’d tell you ever’-
thing, but the sack is I’m putty nigh
dead to git home. W’y, it ’pears like
I ain’t seed Diser an’ my wife sence
the drouth,. You jest oughter see a
doll that I’ve fotched that chile.”
“Wall, fetch it in an’ let us see
it,” said Andy Horn.
“No, not now. I wouldn’t unwrap
it fur pay. I want Diser to see whut
good keer I’ve tuck o’ it. Any o’
you been out my way lately?”
“No, I b’lieve not,” Sam Stoveall
replied. “Everybody is been busy
makin’ cross-ties fur the railroad that
they say is cornin’ through here sum
mers. ’ ’
“Wall, then, fellers, I must shove
on. Good evenin’.”
He did not deliver the flour, but
hurried home, musing that he would
go over to the store after he had wit
nessed Diser’s joy upon beholding the
doll.
“Helloa, what’s this hoss doin’ tied
here?” he said when he drove up to
the gate. Without waiting to unhitch
his horses he seized the box contain
ing the doll and hurried to the house.
His wife met him with a sob, and,
before he could recover from his as
tonishment, the neighborhood physi
cian stepped forward and said:
‘ ‘ Mr. Spencer, there is no hope for
your beautiful little girl. She is dy
ing.”
“My God! Dock, you don’t mean”
He caught sight of the child lying
on a bed in a corner of the room, and,
rushing forward, h edropped on his
knees at her bedside.
“Little angel! little angel! papa
has brought your doll. Little angel—
my God, she don’t know me! Diser
—little angel—speak to me, won’t
you? You mustn’t leave papa, little
precious. He can’t live without you.
Get away, all of you! Let me take
her. ’ ’
He took her in his arms. She look
ed up and said: “You ain’t mad at
me, air you?”
“Oh, my God, sweet angel, don’t
say that! Diser, Diser—merciful
Lawd, doctor, she is chokin’!”
He put her upon the bed, and in
frenzy fell upon the floor and tore his
hair.
“It is all over,” said the doctor.
The whippoorwills among the
branches of the hickory trees tuned
their weird pipes.
