a full programme of all laces, con
tests, trials and other proceedings
for the day on the mot ning of which
we will issue the Fair Bulletin.
This may interfere with onr issue of

Tbl COMPBOHBH.
We p«bl!sb this morning an fdi
torial from |pe IHcayêk* endorsing
the compromise and a ledplhy
article from the Shftjteport Time*
violently opposed to it.
also tfie bffieiat Yepottof tfte rcfRHlt
of the conference, from which it
will be seen that for and in consid
erat ion of the guarantee on ttie
part of the committee represetlfihg
onr side, that no further violence
or intimidation would lie used, th*
Radicals give us two menVrs of
the Returning Board and two on
the Advisory Board.
The principal objection that we
have heard opposed to the compro
mit* is that it i» % recognition on
onr part of the de facto status of the
Kellogg government. So tar as
this objection goes we do not agree
with those who Tttge it. Grant is
determined thit' Kellogg shall lie
de facto and it. in useless for ns to
deny that he is. We have had our
government in folh o|ieration twice
and lioth time* the machinery^
the United states government has
lieen used to put us out and KH
logg in. No sane man can doubt
that Grant intends to carry oot his
intention to sup|>ort Kellogg, until
Congres» decides the de jure claim«
ol our govern meat of which Gov
ernor McEnery is tlie, head*
We do not «blame the gentlemen
who represented our aide for admit
ting this plain fact. We have so
far done so and shall continue to
look the situation square in the face
and shall not deceive ourselves by
attempting to hide it, liecause we
may wish that things were differ
ent from what they are. Tins we
think the Times has done, but done
it unconsciously and honestly. We
do not, however, endorse the other
guarantee ot our committee that no
violence or iutimidation shall be
used. We do not mean by this
that we are ill favor of either vio
lence or intimidation, 'or we are Vi
olently opposed to either, but we
think that the qnarantec given was
au admission that that had been
our policy in the past and was iu
contemplation by us for tho future,
neither of which conclusions is cor
rect. More than this, the commit
tee have given a pledge which they
cannot keep if it should ever be
necessary to rely upon it. They
can no more control such uprisings
as that in New Orleans than they
can dictate to the whirlwind. In
cases like that-at Conshatta when
the negroes w.ere the aggressors
and were in arms, the committee
cannot keep the people from arm
ing iu self defense and it need lie,
employing violence ti suppress the
disorders of the other side. We
have never excused nor do we now
attempt to justify the killing ot the
six radical leaders at Coushatta af
ter they had surrendered and had
been guaranteed protection and
were under the escort ot a guard
chosen by themselves. The guard
should have fought with the men
who took them and have sacrificed
their own lives if it had been ueces
sary. In such an emergency as that
the committee cannot control nor
speak for the people. 4 'Self pro
tection is the first law of nature."
We gain by the compromise two
members of the Returning Board,
who while they are in the minority
will still be in a condition to know
and ex |h >se any attempt at fraud —
This is better than we had before
with all five against us The Ad
visory Board is a tribunal uot
k non ii to the law, and without any
authority save what may be grant
ed by Kellogg. He promises only
to be controlled by them when their
advice may lie in consoiiauce with
the laws ot his own Legislature.—
The enterpretration by those laws
is a matter which under the terms
of the agreement is left to Kellogg
and his outside advisors. The fea
ture of the whole inatt**r to which
we attach the most importance is
the wel! known fact that the pledges
of Kellogg are utterly worthless,
ami that no faith can lie put iu hiiu.
We a«e bound but he will not con
sider himself bouud unless it suits
him.
It is not for us to question the
wisdom nor to impugn the motives
of the honorable gentlemen who
conducted the conference ou our
part. We are willing to tight it out
on any line, compromise or no com
promise. The matter only effected
the election of 1872 and does uot
interfere with the approaching elec
tion except to put us in a little bet
tw rendition.

Wthrt»e or You f feeeltllieen fooling
around and talking about Kellogg
and troops, when the real question
tttat should eUim*>0r tmlividn«t «t.
tentlön, and whicl Wè liavê almost
lost sight of, is the registration
now going on and the election
which is rapHBy approantÉg. Be
fore every election it is the radical
programme to get up disturbances
and have troops sent here to en
courage their ^partisan! and dis
courage our voters* * f î I;' i
The Colfax trouble was forced by
them for its eflfecton Congress then

^aiis tfiey were praying fora
in which some negroes slionld l»e
killed, they laid the trap at Cou
shatta, a«*!- i« »t we stopped
WiiHl mew. - Juit 4a the howl about
this had about ceased, and we.
were quieting down again, then
cornea the revolution. in .New
leans, which while it waa glorious^
and would have lieen undoubtedly
successful bot for Feileral interfer-|to
ence was ill advised and has Wirf
disaftrons "in " Its consequences.
Even since then we have been talk*
ing about the glorious revolution
and abusiug Graut while the ne
groes and radicals have been quiet
ly at work registering, and in the
Parish have got np to date a ma
jority of over 850 votes registered.
This haabéen so quietly done and
they have made so little noise
abont it that we were uot dreaming
of it. This is not liecause they
have any such a majority, but be
cause our voters have not come ont
as they should have done.. The
fall negro strength is now register
ed, and if we get our voters out we
can easily beat them.
Our duty is now plain, and we
are going to say it whether it
pleases our readers or not, and it is
to let Kellogg and the comprotnjsc
and de facto and de jure go to the
devil, and give our whole individu
al attention to the approaching
election. If we elect our Legislr
turc and Treasurer "for the State
and the Parish Offices, we will
care but little tor Kellogg. His
government will be a mythe. The
Legislature can impeach liiin for
the highest of all crimes against the
State, having usurped its govern
ment and then neither Williams
nor Grant can have a word to say.
They do not intend to permit ns to
put him out by force, and we will
be foola to try it again unless we
are in such a desperate strait that
we must make up our minds to
fight the federal troops. The legal
and constitutional method of im
peachment is betöre us and will
soon be in our hands if we stop this
dilly-dallying and talk about not
participating in the election and
bind all our energies to the plain
task ahead of us. Let ns then to
work ! Let us work late and early,
work all the time, work at night if
necessary and never stop working
until every vote is fairly cast and
honestly counted.
Our very salvation is at stake ;
we have everything to work for
that a freeman can hold dear or a
white man cherish as sacred. The
right to own and cultivate lands
without having them burdened with
a taxation that amounts to confis
cation ; the privilege of a voice in
the administration of the affairs of
our State, and the right to protect
her fair name and reputation from
the foul blot that repudiation will
put u|ion it, and more than all, the
power to thrust from her high plans
the Kangaroo and harpies who
hold a high carnival of fraud, de
bauchery and bribery in i>ositious
which were once considered houor
able.
Let us then torget all else than

two mill'» above Alexandria, and will
eontlnne n* ndrertised for four tiny«.
Persons who desire to uid tlie enter
prise ran now do so by liberally pur
chasing the Lottery Tickets which are
for sale at all tlie principal stores, and
by preparing articles for Exhibition.
The large Hull for Agricultural Imple
ments is now about finidied as are
nlso stalls for entile and stables for
horses. Several liorse» aie now on the
ground and tuiiny others will be here
in a few days.
The littéral preminmnn offend will
doubtless attract a large display in all
the Departments and the success of
this Fair is now assured. The Hoard
of Directors desei Te great credit for t'ie
perfection of all the arrangement made.
Judge Tims. C. Manning will deliver
the opening sddress and Mr. W. II.
Jack of the Natchitoches liar, the ad
dress to ihe Knights. Yeagers brass
band has been engaged and will be here
the four days and play for the Ball on
the last night. A hired police besides
a large force of Marshalls will be in at
tendance to preserve order Let every
one now do i>omething for the Fair.
Tint K vtciikk's W ar —We ot«erv« that
Mr. W. N. Calvit in utill selling the bent
quality of good fat beef at his butcher
Stall, for six and scran cents, and that tie
is getting rid oi it as fast as he supply's
it. notwithstandinK that tlie other Butch
ers have combined and reduced the price
to ßive cents cash. As Mr. Calvit gets his
custom because he keeps only the very
liest of Reef and sohl it at 3 cents less per
pound, it is natural to expect that he will
continue to do so, but we snspect that the
late move of tlie combined Hntchers is to
rnn him out and then put the price back
again »o ten cents. If they will enter in
to an obligation to keep the price down to
5 cents and furnish the same quality of
lieef, we will say that they deseive all the
support or the greater part of it. but we
wonld not like to see them run ont our
pioneer, Mr W. N. Calvit, and then go
back to the old order of things. That
wonld hardly l»e fair We snggest. to both
parties to fix the rates by agreement, say
at H cents per ft, and obligate themselves
to stick to it This will be fair, and then

Gov. Wells addressed the Conven

most decided objection Mr. Win.
Kelso, thought that as there hail
bei r n no conference of committees
it was too late to sorinir the ques

that the white man had as much
right to come to the black man as
the black man to come to him.
Mr J. I® Kelso sustained the

Kelso oppriRcd if in another speech.
He was rding the waves on the

Alien was in favor ot the motion
.Mr. Jackson was afraid ol Demo

the motion because 'lie Democrats
had never e une to the Republicans
and said we will take up am body;
when they coiild'nl find any body

to go outside. With this the »mat

Mr John Mayo the present in
