still stands t he qluatint two century old
house whltre Nat tht inel I lawt horne was
born, and to liher shriineits of American
literat lre. So we tuvine to this old and
historic but modern and progressive
city, the hirtlhlilaei, and home of Henry
\Vadlsworth Lonigfelhiow.
It Is gratifying to know that the
house where I.ongfllow livedl many
years and wheire iianny of his ipoems
were written is to lie lpresterveld as a
public nieniorial to the poet. By the
terms of the will of Mrs. Anna Long
fellow Pierce, hls sister and the last
Immediate member of the illustrious
family, who died some months ago, the
Longfellow residence on Congre is
street was beque:thled to the Maine
Historical society, under certain ~ondl
tions, among them being that the socd
ety shall make Its home in the building
and prepare it for occupancy by other
similar organizations that may wish to
use It as a meeting place. Another pro
vision binds tihe society to erect a hall
for its meetings and accommodation of
its library, to connect with the main
house, which must be left substantially
as it stands. It is also provided that
"the two front rooms upon the first
floor of the house are to be kept with
appropriate articles for a memorial of
the home of Longfellow."
The conditions imposed by the will
have been accepted by the society. It
is estimated that such a hall as is de
sired will cost about $25,000 and that
an annual expenditure of $2,500 will be
necessary to keep tile house and muse
um open to the public. The question
of how to raise this amount has been a
rather perplexing one to the active
members of the historical society, but
they have now assurances which war
rant the acceptance of the obligation.
The house which is thus to be pre
served was not the birthplace of Henry
W. Longfellow, as the mansion was
undergoing alterations at the time of
hie birth and the family was tem
porarily living in a house at Hancock
and Fore streets, now used as a tene- 1
ment house, but which is marked by a 1
tablet. The Longfellow residence was t
built In 1785 by General Peleg Wads- I
worth, grandfather of the poet, a Revo
lutionary hero and for 14 years a mem
ber of congress. it was originally two
stories high, the third story being add
ed in 1826. It has undergone no alters- t
tIons since the latter date, though large -
business blocks have been built on t
three sides of it. EI
The place is Intimately associated
with General Wadsworth and his sons. ,
Henry Wadsworth, lieutenant In the
United States navy, who lost his life g
under Commodore Preble before Trip- '
oil In 1804, and Alexander Scammell I

on the Constitution in the escape from
the British squadron and in the action
with the Guerriere in the war of 1812.
It was afterward the home of General
Wadsworth's son-In-'aw, Stephen Long
fellow. His childred were born In this
house with the exception of the two
oldest. The second of these was Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow. Here his
youth and early manhood were passed,
and here be returned every year in

were plainly visible, and from these
sources came the inspiration of many
of his poems.
The Longfellow house was the first
brick structure built within the city
limits and is a typical example of the
best residences of this section in the
latter part of the eighteenth and early
part of the nineteenth centuries.
It is a little way back from the
busy street and is surrounded by trees

FIREMEN AT BUFFALO.
Plans For the Natiomal sad New
York State Conenatlons.
[Special Correspondence.]
BUTFFALC, July 29.-Firemen all over
the country are looking forward to
firemen's week, beginning Aug. 19, at
the Pan-American exposition, with the
brightest anticipation of a right good
time. There will be more firemen as
sembled at the exposition during that
week than ever were gathered in one
spot before in the history of this coun
try. In the great throng will be ex
empts, volunteers and paid firemen
from all parts of Canada and the Unit
ed States.
The fifth annual convention of the
National Firemen's association of the
United States will be held at Buffalo
from Aug. 22 to 24, and the New York
State Firemen's association will hold
its annual convention in the same
place on Aug. 22 and 23.
A firemen's tournament will be held
in the magnificent Stadium of the ex
position on the 22d and 23d, and an ex
Straordinary programme of events in
iwhich firemen are to participate ex
clusively has been arranged by the ex
positlen committee of sports in con
junction with the Buffalo Volunteer
Firemen's association.
The Buffalo committee having the
matter of reception, entertainment, etc.,
in charge is in receipt of communica
tions from the secretaries of hundreds
of organizations in different p at`ab
the country stating that their compa
nies are coming from 50 to 300 strong.
The visitors will be in uniform, and
many of them will bring equipment.
The best drilled companies in the Unit
ed States will be present and will com
pete for prizes in the Stadium. No bet
ter place for a firemen's tournament
could be provided than this granld struc
ture within the exposition grounds. It
has a quarter mile running t,!acK and
an expansive field, large enough to ac
commodate all the events desirable.
The seating capacity is 12,000.
There are about 375,000 firemen in
this country, and a fair representation
of this number at Huffalo means a tre
mendous crowd. A feature of the week
will be a mammoth parade, in which
more than 200 firemen's associations
will be in line.
The Buffalo Veteran Volunteer Fire
men's association has appointed com
mittees to take complete charge of the
arrangements, both for the convention
and the visitors to the exposition. A
fine entertainment programme has been
arranged. The association committee
is as follows: Fire Commissioner Wil
liam Parsons, Casper J. Drescher, Louis
I*oebert, Fred %W. Haas, Jacob Shoe
maker, George Smith, Jacob L Mensch,
Andrew Driskill and ex-Senator Matt
Endres. An honorary citizens' com
m;ttee has been appointed, with Mayor
Courad Diehl as chairman.
The visiting firemen are assured a
royal welcome and splendid entertain
ment in the Pan-American city. At
the exposition they will find one of the
best fire d(]partments in tlir country
and exhibits of all of the:l: latest things
in fire fighting marchinry.
