Aside from Its culinary attractions,
the rice kitchen attracts a great deal
of attention on account of the bean
tiful wood that has been used In Its
construction. The lumber was shipped
from LouisIana and Texas. The panels
and friezes are remarkable specimens
of the curled golden pine. The doors
und. window trimmings are of cnrled
cypress. These two ornamental woods
are found in great quantitIes through
