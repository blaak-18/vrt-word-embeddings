—A lady friend from Bayou

diamond shape. They are highly
polished, and resemble tbe point of
an Indian arrow. They are evident
ly from tbe Sea, or some planet
above us. They came dowu ma

gathered in great quantities.^
These little curiosities can beoseen
at our office. A few days ago a

BOOK REVIEW.
Narative of the War Between the
States, by
GENL. JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON.
D. Appleton fc Co., Publishers.
1874.
Through the kindness and courtesy
of Mr. W. K. Johnson, the local Agent
for the sale of the book here—we
just in receipt of this volume. It is
elegantly bound, printed on most ex
cellent, white clean paper, and pre
sents tbe most respectable appearance
of any recent work that has come nn
der onr observation. It is sold only
by subscription, Price $5 00 cloth.
Col. Jack Wharton is the Agent for
the State of Louisiana. We predict
for it a larger sale than any similar
work has ever met with among the
Southern people.
We have not at present, sufficient
space at our command to do anything
like justice to General Johnston's work,
and much to our regret, for we would
like to reply to a review of thi«e col
umns length we have just read in the
latest uuniber of the New York Week
ly Sun, which is so eviil^ntly tinged
with the animosity of .the Northern civ
ilian towards one of the most formida
ble of the opponents of the North in
our recent struggle; as to do General
Jolînston great injustice. The article
of the Sun is in marked contrast with
the expressions of the opinion of Gen
eral J. Hooker of the U. S. Army^ pub
lished in the work itself; and of the
two, we much prefer to follow the
opinion of one who fought Genl. Jolin
*ston and who had hetter appnrtuuities
ot judging of his military capacity and
of the generalship displayed by him in
his campaigns, than had the critic of
the Sun. We honor General J. Hooker
for that letter to General Johnston, and
applaud the generosity of the true sol
dier, who when his former enemy had
laid down his arms, did not hesitate to
express his admiration for his genius
or to do justice to his military aperar
tions, although against himself. Let
the soldiers on both sides who fought
the war, settle the matter of animosity
between the two sectious of onr coun
try, free from the inlçnneddling of civ
ilians who remained at home while the
lighting was being done, and we are
no prophet, if the "bloody chasm" is
not bridged in an inconceivably short
time, and both North and South unite
n a common policy of protection,'^ood
feeling, aud national priPJe. Let each
section retain tho sacred memory of
its heroic dead; let eacli build historic
monuments to perpetuate the recollec
tion of the gigantic contest of brother
against brother; let the one find cou
solution in defeat by reflecting that no
foreign foe was the conquero', and tho
other learn to be magnanimous in vic
tory by remembering that the van
quished is the weaker biother of the
same tamily, that both have a common
history, and a common destiny, and we
will hear no more of oppression on the
one hand nor animosity 9»n the other.
The only fault we have to find with
TIIK NARRATIVE, is tllilt tOO llllicll of its
contents is taken ^ip in a discussion of
the controversy "hetwoen President
Davis and the author. We do not,
however, grumble very much at the
author, for all our sympathies are with
him. 0 o
1 lie matter is one of vital inipor-i»//a}«7$.
tance to General Johnston and, upon
the strength or weakness of his defense
of himself depends the position he will
occupy in history, either as a weak,
wavering, excessively^autious, hot to
say cowardly, commander oi as tlie
crafty, prudent and bold genius, wlio
is worthy of the'mci i(t»<-corded hiin by
his enemies during the war, who plac
ing his name in "perilous connection"
with that of the immortal Lee, advised
their Generals "to beware of Leo o'l
the advance, and of Johnston on tlio
retreat." ° 5
Having, as Genernl Johnston has to
do, contend for his fame againsi tho
odds of having the roiemost mnu of his
owu side, as an adversary, it behpoves
him to bo painstaking and elaborate in
his owri> defense. We tSinlc that he
has succeeded admirably well in "mak
ing out his case,® as the lawyera[ e say;
and as oneof the jurors sitting upon its
trial, we render our verdictfu his fcivor.
We well remembe< the effect npc»t the
portion of the army to which v\?e be
longed, when it was announce«! that
General Johnston had been removed
from the command of the army iiufront
of Atlanta and General Hood given his
command. Tho former had the confi
dence <it the whole army, aud the lat
ter was not held in that esteem which
was necessary for successful operations.
Had they both been the recipients! of
the same confidence and respect from
the army generally, a change of'com
manders in the face of an advancing
foe, largely superior in numbers, was a
hazardous experiment, that could
hardly have resulted otherwise tljan it
did, in confusion, defeat and disaster.
It was generally predicted then in
camp, that President Davis had inflict
ed tho deatli blow of the Confederacy,
and wo solemnly believe to-day, that
the removal of Geneial Johnston was
the cause of the change in our fortunes
and rapid disintegration of our forces,
culminating so shortly in our irretriev
able defeit and inglorious surrender.
The quarrel between v Mr. Davis aud
General Johnston seems to have
originated in the desire of Mr. Davis
that General, Johnston should be al
ways fighting a largely superior force
in a fair open field with the odds
heavily against hfm, nnd tho nnwilli
uess ou the part of this latter to engage
the superior forces until by stragic re
treets be bad drawn him from , bis
bases of stfpplies and got him iuto
positions where be could engage him
with an equal show of victory ; the
advantages of the positions sought by
him, to counterbalance the disparity
of numbers.
We are not a competent critic upon
such matter of generalship and military
strategy, and will not. pretend to dis?
cuss the question of-this difference of
opinion between Jwo such great men.
We are, however, satisfied from the
Îersual of the narrative that General
ohnston had good reusons for all of
Iiis retreats. Mr. Davis being a civi
lian, and General Johnston a soldier
who had seen service in the Seminole
war and in Mexico, besides baviug been
a Brigadier General in the old U. S.
Army. e We are inclined to take his
views as being correct and to believe
that Mr. Davis was over confident in
his opinions on military- strategic
movement. The book is well worthy
the careful persuul of all and is an
invaluable "Contribution to the
future historian" for whom General
Johnston in his modest preface, says
he wrote.
It can be had at the Drng store of
Dr. Henry St. John.
BUSINESS LAWS. *
We will in this column endeavor to
present our readers with the main
features of the Laws of Louisiana,
relat ive to every day affairs, in a
brief and comprehensive for.n; an d
solicit questions which we will an
swer gratuitously, if upon legal
matter3 of general interest:
CREDIT. CREDITOR.
It a merchat sells goods, to a custo
mar upon credit, the title is immediate
ly vested in the purchaser, and the
merchant has only his action for the
purchase price. He has, however, the
Vendorslien upon the goods, as long
as they remain in the hands of the first
pnrchasor. This lien of course, can
only be enforced upon the identical
goods sold by tho merchant. The
term of credit is usually regulated by
special contract; in the absence of
such a contract the creditor can enforce
payment at any time. The creditor
can at his option extend the time of the
credit, but if there are any securities
upou the original contract, they' are
released by au extension to tbe princi
pal.
DONATION,
May ho made, inter vivas, while living ;
or mortis causa, in prospect of death.
In the case of personal property it may
be made by manual gift, but if real
estate is to he donated, it should be
done by a notarial act. Both kinds of
donation deprive the donor of the
ownership at one© and vests it com
pletely and fully in the donee. The
donor cannot'deprive himself of all
Iiis property, he must retain a snfiEbien
c y tor his support. The law imposes
certain other restrictions upon dona
tions, but an explanation of them,
does not properly bcloug here.
ERROR.
Error, under certain circumstances,
may vitiate a contract. Any error that
shows that there was not tho union of
the minds of the contracting parties,
will be sufficient can so to annul the
cou tract. 9
FRAUD.
inipor-i»//a}«7$. Collusion* iutimatefVconnect
All fraud vitiates the contract based
upon it. Tho law abhors fraud or
even the suspicion of it. This abhor
ence is expressed in the maxim : "Let
ho polluted hand touch tlio temple of
justice." The pre-requisite of apsuc
cessful appen>-nce in court is clean
"cd with fraud, and is dealt with by tbe
law in much tl^o samo manner that it
deals with its usual companion, fraud.
FURNISHERS OF^ÜPPLIES.
The furnishers of supplies has a lion
and privelege upon the crop made
with his advances.. The last Legisla
ture, so-callcd, has besides given the
planter a right to pledge his crop tt?
secure the furnisher of supplies. A
senseless and useless change, which
will benefit nobody. It is necessary
that the Furnisher of supplies should
record a statement of his lien to
preserve it. This may be doue by
settling what is to be the amount of
the advances, in the beginning of the
year and obtaining from the plan
ter his signature before two witnesses
to some such document as this:
O
$500
January 1st 1875.
oT acknowledge that I am indebted
unto John Smith, Merchant, or his oP
der, in the full sum of Five Hundred
Dollars, for advances of money and
necessary Supplies made and to be
made by him to enable me to make
tho crop of cotton, corn &c, to be
cultivated ov me during the year 1875,
upon the " Oak Grovo Plantation" in
Rapide** Parish, for tho reimbursement
of which amount the said John Smith,
lias a lien and privelige npon all of
my said crop of cotton, corn &c, ac
corded him by law and this is to give
notice thereof.

" Don't prevaricate, sir," thundered
a Columbia judge to a witness from

answered the miner, " Ever since I got
a kick from a mule that krrooked my

" Wife, what has become of the

hens picked them off," was the bland
reply. " Hens—hens—some twô leg

We believe&t in rare that 'an editor

upon to record a " meloncholy event''
at a time when his head was rather
heavy, and did it after the following
manner :
" Yesterday morning at four o'clock
p. M., a man with a heel in tbe bole of
his stockiug, committed arsenic by
swallowing suicide. The inquest of
the verdict returned a jury that the
deceased came to the facts "in accord

Sometimes I'm hot, sometimes I'm sool;
When strong, my master is a fool ;
When good, yet firm, 'tis seen by all
My master's wisdom is not small.
When I am ruled by stronger will,
I do no harm, for I am still ;
But when to stay me man ne'er tries,
Some great, disaster may arise.
Though oft I'm quiet as a lamb.

The «Literal Schoolroy — Among
the scholars when Lamb and Cole
ridge attended was a clergyman's sou
iffy the name of Simon Jennings. On
account of his dismal and gloomy
nature bis playmates bad named him
Pontius Pilate. One morning he went
up to the master, Dr. Boyer, and said
in his i&nal whimpering manner,
" Please, Dr. Boyer,fthe boys call me
Pontius Pilato." If there was one
thing old Boyer hated more tliän a
false quantity in Greek and Latin it
was tbe practice of nicknaming. Rush
ing down among the schoolars from
Iiis pedestal of state, with cane in band,
he cried, with his nsual voice of
thunder : " Listen, boys ; the next
time I hear any of you say ' Pontius
Pilate' I'll cane yoa as long as this
cane will last. You are to say ' Simon
Jonnings,' and not ' Pontius Pilate.'
Remember that, if yon value gpur
hides." Having said this, Jupiter
Tonans remounted Olympus, the clouds
still hanging on bis brow. Next day,
when the sam? class were reciting tbe
©
$
catechism, a boy of dull and literal
turn of mind lind to repeat the creed.
Ile had got as far as " suffered under,"
aud was ab^ut popping out tho next
word, when Buyer's prohibitation un
luckily flashed upon his obstruse niind.
After a moment's hesitation he blurted
out. " Suffered nnder Sipjon Jennings,
cruci"—The rest of the word was never
utterred, for Boyer had already sprung
like a tiger npon bim, and the cane
was descending upon his unfortunate
shoulders like a Norwegian bail storm
or an Alpine avalanche. When the
irato doctor had discharged his cane
storm upon him he cried: " What do
you mean, 3'on booby, by sncli blas
phemy!" "I only did as yon told
me," replied the simple-minded boy.
" Did as I told you ?" roared old
Boyer, now wound up to something
above the boiling point. " What do
yon mean 1" As he said tbis be again
instinctively grasped bis cane more
turiously. " Yes, doctor, you said we
were always to call 'Pontius Pilate'
'Simon Jennings.' Didn't be, Sam]?"
appealed the unfortunate culprit to
Coleridge, who was next to him. Sam
said naught, but old Boyer, who saw
what a dunce he had to deal with,
cried. " Boy, yon are a fool. Where
are yonr brains Î" Poor Dr. Boyer for
a second time was floored, for the
scholar said, with an earnestness that
proved its truth, but to the intense
horror of the learned potentate. " In
my stomach, sir !" The doctor always
respected that boy 's stupidity ever
after as though half afrain that a stray
blow mignt be unpleasant.
ET* Will the Gazette kindly in
form us why it did not publish that
article abont Judge Barlow, the
proof of which its Editor showed
to two responsible gentlemen in
town 1 Had the arrival of the Hon
Senator anything to do with its
suppression f That was doing ns
too bad. We had intended writing
an article on the subject, but when
we heard that the Gazette had one
ready and what it was, we conclu
ded, as it pretended to be working
with us, that we would leave the
field to the wavering Gazette.. It
wonld have come with better grace
from that source, and it was too
bad to fool us in that way.
We will watch out for Kelso tbe
next time we give away to the Ga
zette. We suspect that that ride
of George's with the Madam to the
Lake or some where else, had some
thing to do with it.
R ailroad .—From a private let
ter to a gentleman in this place, we
learu that there was a meeting of
the Board of Directors of the Lou
isiana Central Railway Co., in New
York city. The writer of the letter
speaks very encouragingly of the
prospects of their ability to go to
work in a short time on the road
commencing first at this point.
The debts of the Central road con
tracted here will be paid, so the
writer says, in April or May.
That's right, George the pro
prietor, come np every once in-a

straight. Put him after ns " to
