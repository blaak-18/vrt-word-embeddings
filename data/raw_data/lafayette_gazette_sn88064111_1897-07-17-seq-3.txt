Reflected in the Papers of this
Great State.
The friends of the waterworks
*nqvement can rest assured that the
intention of putting in a system in
New Iberia is not dead, nor is it
very sound asleep. It will be taken
up in its-proper time. This is one
of the benefits the people of Alex
andria get from their waterworks:
The free water hydrant, estab
lished by the city authorities on De
Soto street, near Second, is being
well patronized. People come
:from all directions outside of Alex
â€¢andria and haul the water home in
barrels. Surely the Alexandria
artesian.wells are of as much bene
"fit to *e people residing in the
-country as those living in. town.
Town Talk.
We would almost wager, and let
the stakes be "sizeable," that there
cannot be found ten taxpayers in
in Alexandria who would be without
their waterworks and electric light
plants. New Iberia will have them
in the near future, but this is an
Instance when it is economy not to
hasten too quickly.-Iberian, Dem.
Within the next two weeks a tar
iff law for the protection of every
thing American, will display the
Wilson-Gorman measure which
failed to do everything except to
pauperize the country. The Ding
ley bill passed the Senate Thursday
by a majority of ten after some
considerable amendments, but the
changes made were not in the di
rection of altering either its revenue
producing or protection features.
It now goes to a conference com
mittee and while there may be some
minor differences to adjust between
the House and Senate, no trouble
is anticipated in both branches
reaching an agreement at a very
early date. Perhaps no State in
the Union has fared so well as
Louisiana in the new bill-sugar,
rice and lumber, the three principal
industries of the State are amply
protected, and since the full
'force of the law is felt we may
look for a healthy business con
dition. Louisiana rejoices in
common, with all other States
in the complete redemption of
the pledges made by the Repub
lican party. We have received
even more than we dared hope for
-everybody is satisfied except the
false prophets and little politicians
who paraded the State last fall and
assured the people that they had
nothing to expect from the Repub
lican party.--Sugar Belt Vindicator,
iRep.
Paternal legislation for trusts,
corporations and millionaires has
always been characteristic of the
Republican party, and when the
party of the plutocrats suggests
anti-trust legislation, for the pur
pose of humbugging the people,
they make pitiable spectacles of
themselves. The trusts of America
own the Republican senators, and
their side plays to make the people
believe otherwise are ridiculous.
Iberville South, Dem.
Trusts and combines suppress all
legitimate competition in trade, and
by monopolizing the markets them
selves fix the prices of everything
under their control. They control
now almost every known industry
and product of the country and are
particularly destroying the legiti
mate commerce of the world. If
there is not some legislation by
Congress to" break their greed and
power the people will not submit to
their domination and robbery much
longer.-Crowley Signal.
The Tiles-Democrat has opened
its batteries on the Western Union
Telegraph monopoly. That paper
demonstrates that the dividends of
the Western Union are 48 per cent.
The position is taken by the Times
Democrat that the people would
fare better in the matter of rates,
service, etc., for the government to
establish lines to be managed in
connection with the post-office de
partment. The position of our con
temporary is surely an advanced
one for a metropolitan paper to oc
cupy, and it will be a long time be
fore its dream will be- realized.
The monopolies have- thie country
by the throat, and as long as the
telegraph, railroad and other large
corporations band together for mu
-epl protection against legislation it
will not be an easy matter to outdo
them. :The law - makers, both
-national and State, get free service
from these corporations, and as
long as they do, the power of the
lobbyist will be supreme.-Mans
field Journal, Dem.
Samuel Douglas McEnery, junior
United States Senator from
Louisiana, as deserving of every
consideration by the citizens of his
State for the fidelity with which he
has guarded their interests during
the framing of the tariff bill, so
recently passed by the Senate. A
new and inexperienced man in the
matter of national legislation, Sen
ator McEnery has immediately
come to the front and taken fore
rank among his colleagues of the
South by reason of his strong pro
tective views and the patriotic
manner in which he has sacrificed
partisanship for the good of his
States and the people of the whole
country.-New Orleans Republican,
Rep.
When the Roman Catholic church
in Portsmouth, Ga. burned down
some days ago, the Baptist and
Methodist churches of the city
offered the homeless congregation
the free use of their chapels until it
could provide itself with another
edifice, and three Methodist and
one Episcopal clergyman called
personally on the priest to express
their sympathy with him and his
people. This is the kind of spirit
that ought to dominate in all chris
tian sections.-Rayne Tribune.
Yes, Brother Hearne, that is
practical Christianity. -Shreveport
