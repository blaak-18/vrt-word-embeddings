WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
Champion American Comic Paper !
Illnstrated by a corps of the best Ameri
can artists, andl contributed to by the
lmost popular humnorists and satirists of
the clay.
Wild Oats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has beconme t lie establlisled hunmorous and
satirical paper of the contiry. It was
st:rted and conltiinued the first year is a
mnonthly, then, to satisty tihe demiaind of
the public, it was chaniged to a fortnlight
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting folly as it-fiies, ail showilg up
tihe pIolitical and social shun1s by its
masterly eartoons anlid punlgent editoria]s,
it achieved even greater success thatn
before, and was recognized as the ablest
and brightest of its clas. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
Ing the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnish illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth. Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jamp, Keettels,
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, anid several
others who are yet known to famite.
In its literary depaetmeuts Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least, one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and sqluibs
will be sparkling, origiual and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular,,and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can oftlnd the most fas
tidious.

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
"What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR JBIT
TERS " Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
Ihe patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicino been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of Vis
EGAR 13BiT'rTERS in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflaninmmation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The propertles of DM. WALK
ER'S VINEGAR BITTERS are Aperient, Dia
phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious, Laxa
tive. Dliuretic, Sedative, Counter- Irritant,
Sudorific, Alterative, and Anti-Bilious.

anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these van
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to DR. J. WALKER'S VINEGAR
BITT'as, as they will speedil, remove
thedark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy lfune
tions of the digestive, organs.

For Inafanmatory and Chronic
