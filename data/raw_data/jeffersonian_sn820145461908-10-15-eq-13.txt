THE JEFFERSONIANS, Thomson, Ga.
The Ad Man’s Galley
By fames Lanier.
Just a word about the Jeffersonian
.bonds. Our paper and magazine are
not quite two years old yet, and they
have had an uphill pull all the way.
Like most reformers, they have had
to fight against prejudice and misrep
resentation. But they have made
their way, and made their mark, and
it is only a question of time when
the Jeffersonians will be the voice of
the white people of the South and
West.
But it takes money to run papers
and magazines. Just “for ’nin
stance, ” a new magazine in the
North, which is pressing to the front,
spends $12,000 at a clip in postage
stamps on letters to prospective sub
scribers. To develop the Jefferson
ians along the right lines we need
more money, and we are offering
bonds to the amount of $25,000. They
pay seven per cent interest, which is
nearly double the rate paid by most
savings banks, and the investment is
secured in such a manner as to make
it absolutely safe.
After all, the personal equal ion is
the most powerful factor in the safe
ty of banks. Safes have lime locks,
but cashiers and presidents have
none. In the case of the Jeffersonian
bgnds, the holders have the tangible
property as security and also a per
sonal guarantee which is worth more
than all. These bonds are strictly
gilt-edged, in the parlance of the mar
ket.
In looking over our advertising col
umns you will note the absence of
fraudulent and misleading statements.
We have made it a rule to turn down
every suggestion of a get-rich-quick
scheme, and every advertisement that
savflred of uncleanness or dishonesty.
On our rate cards you will fifrd the
statement: “No ad. that will offend
or cheat our subscribers inserted at
any price.”
Our advertising columns are grow
ing. We had to enlarge our paper to
four columns to take care of the ads.,
and now we have reduced our rates.
Each week our paper is read by over
100,000 people. That means that
when you insert an ad. in the Week
ly Jeffersonian you are sending out a
notice to that number of readers.
Suppose you were to send a postal
card to 100,000 persons. The postage
alone would cost you SI,OOO. You get
the same publicity in the Weekly Jef
fersonian for two or three dollars.
See the point'?
By the way, we are running the ads.
of several pecan growers. Pecans are
good things to be interested in. Slow
growth, and all that, but there’s mon
ey in them. It is figured that good
land, set in vigorous grafted or bud
ded pecan trees, will be worth at the
end of the first year SIOO per acre,
and SSO is added to this value at the
end of each year of growth. With
this as a basis, the land would be
worth $550 at the end of 10 years,
and SBOO at the encl of 15 years. The
net income per acre is estimated at
8 per cent at the end of the tenth
year; that is, $44 per acre on the
valuation of $550. By the twentieth
ISlje Jeffersonian
year Ihe nd income, which is the
amount remaining after deducting the
expense of cultivating ami fertilizing
the trees and gathering the nuts,
would be SB4 per acre, and the value
of one acre would have risen to
$1,050.
Our subscribers have always taken
a keen interest in the growth of the
Jeffersonians, and the quick response
to our appeal last week was both wel
come and surprising. We asked, and
we are asking again this week, that
each true Jeffersonian send us at least
one new subscriber this month. To
get forty-four new subscribers, in di
rect answer to cur appeal, two days
after publication, was a strong proof
that Mr. Watson’s followers do not
allow the grass to grow under their
feet. Keep up the work. Remember
that every convert to the Jeffersonian
faith leads to more conversions. The
chain is endless.
One day last summer wo wrote to
a Jeffersonian subscriber in Minneso
ta, asking him if he could not find a
few other subscribers for us. His re
ply was memorable: ‘'Jeffersonians
are as scarce as hen’s teeth out in
this country; BUT IF I CAN’T FIND
ANY, I WILL MAKE SOME.” And
he made ’em. FifM came one sub
scription, then another, then two
more, and now, in the neighborhood
of that man’s home, where there was
one lone Jeffersonian a few months
ago, we little bunch of eleven
subscribers, who are all true Jeffer
sonians.
“Go thou and do likewise.”
We are glad to pay the expenses of
any man who will work for us. We
don’t expect him to work for noth
ing. An active, agent can make a
good living, and if yon will write to
us we will tell you how to do it.
And the Jeffersonians are not “for
men ojily. ” Some of our best agents
are ladies —and we want to say right
here that our lady agents, without ex
ception, send their lists in better
shape and cause less trouble than
most of the men agents.
Mrs. I. M. Lanier, of Kissimmee,
Fla., writes: “Here is $1 to renew
my subscription to your valued pa
per. We could not. keep house with
out both Jeffs. Aly husband takes
the magazine. They are the greatest
educators on earth, ve think.”
From Parkman, Wyoming, .Mr. D.
A. Diltz says: “Please see that no
lapse occurs in having the two Jef
fersonians come to me without the
loss of a number. It is not the loss
of the commodity value of your pa
pers that affects me, but their spirit
ual intrinsic value.”
A. letter from Mr. Simeon Grove,
Hilltown, Pa., reads: “Aly wife and
I both wish thee well in thy work of
teaching those that are blinded by the
fight of tradition and ignorant of the
right way. We esteem thy paper
above all that come to our house, and
wo would not be without it. May the
tires burn forever that thou hast
lighted upon the altars of the Jeffer
sonians.”
