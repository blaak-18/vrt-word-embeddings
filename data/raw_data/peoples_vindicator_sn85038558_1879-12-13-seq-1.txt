A Thursday Christmas.
This year Christmas fills on a
Thursday. The old rhyme says:
If Xmas day on a Thursday be, Ia
A windy winter ye shall see ;
Winly weather in each week,
And hard tempests strong and thick : a
The summer shall le good and dry,
Corn and heats shall multiply ;
That year is good for lands to till
Kings and princes shall die by kill ;
If a child born that day shal be, t
It shall happen right well for he:;
Of deed be shall be good and stable,
Wise of speech and reasonable,
Who so that day goes thieving about, ai
lie shall be punished without doubt; a
And if sickness that day betide,
It shall quickly from thee glide.
