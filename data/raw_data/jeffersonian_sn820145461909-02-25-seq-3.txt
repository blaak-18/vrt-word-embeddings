T was the great desire of
Melissa Reed’s heart to
do something truly worth
while, something that
makes one count in 'the
world, and when she went
to join the vast army of
trained nurses*it was with
——■———J the hope that the vocation
would prove the means by which she
would attain to greatness. The step
was a departure from the well-beaten
track of all former young women of
Hickory Hill settlement and in es
tablishing a precedent, she forthwith
became a target for many condemna
tory shots from the neighbors.
“Goin’ to be er train nuss! Well,
I ain’t never yit seen er gal with any
gumption break her neck to git to er
horsepit’l to larn what like as not she
ain’t got no turn fer. Nine out’ii ten
goes countin’ on ketchin’ er young
doctor fer er husban’ an’ they gin’-
ally git left. Mark my words, M’lis’ll
come back an’ not know ’nough to
make er mush poultice,” scoffed old
Mrs. Edson, the sharpest tongued gos
sip in the community.
The Reeds were crestfallen. They
had been much elated over Melissa’s
ambitious move, but Mrs. Edson’s
opinion carried weight. She was ac
counted high authority on such mat
ters by reason of her calling and her
travels. She was a ladies’ nurse and
often in the discharge of her profes
sional duties went as far as fifteen
miles from home.
“Well, M’lis ain’t ezactly at er
horsepit’l,” weakly defended the fa
ther, “she writes ’t she’s stayin’ at
er sanctar’m.”
“What’s ’at?” asked the lady of
rasping speech. Henry Reed cleared
his throat and explained from his dim
conception of the word.
“It’s one of these here places sort
of betwixt er church and er horse
pit’l where they has ordilies ’n’ sich
like. We call ’em stewards in the
Methodis’ church, I take it.”
Mrs. Edson did not understand, but
nevertheless was impressed all the
more by not understanding. The un
known commanded her respect and
she was visibly mollified.
“Well, mebbe M’lis’ll do better’ll
most of ’em; I’m in high hopes ’at
she will. Anything but er horsepit’l
says I, senee Gid Dan’els was fetched
from there to the graveyard, ’n’ him
with nothin’ the matter but ar’sip’-
lus in his foot. Fust they cut off his
foot ’n’ then his laig, butch’rd him
by inches. Looks like they take rale
pleasure at these here horsepit’ls in
cuttin’ you up ’n’ then chargin’ you
er hund’ed dollars for the job.”
As time passed it became generally
known among the neighbors that Mel
lissa had no idea of being a common
every day nurse. With lofty aspira
tion she would wear the Red Cross
and go where great good could be ac
complished and renown won. At last
she graduated and was coming home.
The moment Melissa stepped from
the train and glanced about the fa
miliar old place where there was no
change save that wrought by time and
weather, there was a rush of memo
ries and a spirit of dissatisfaction
claimed her. Yonder were the two
or three unattractive looking stores
THE NEARBY
..... "By M. "Buckner
and half dozen houses scattered here
and there; and there was the usual
number of loungers about the station,
their chief interest in life apparently
to watch the trains arrive and depart
and to stare at any one who happened
to come or go. It might have been
yesterday that she had gone away in
stead of'three long years ago. Hick
ory Hill wore its characteristic air of
settled content and being at peace
with all the world. And here was
Hilly to imeet her, greatly grown and
tanned, but still wearing clothes faded
and patched and not over clean, his
hair needing cutting badly. It would
not have been Billy if he had looked
otherwise. His appearance reminded
her rudely of the hardships of earlier
years and was so like a dash of ice
water in her face that she failed to
see the genuine joy with which he
greeted her.
“Lemme see your v’lise, sis,” in a
manly way with eager brown hand
extended for her grip, and he led the
way. to the ramshackle, unpainted old
wagon, where with the aid of an
obliging bystander he managed to
store her trunk and bag, and giving
a cheery cluck to the jaded farm
horse, they started briskly homeward
down the cool woods road.
The mother and a flock of children
were in the piazza watching for her
coming, and when the wagon rattled
up to the gate they swarmed out to
meet her, the younger ones shrinking
back shyly in awe of the tall sister,
whose voice, manner and dress bore
the unmistakable mark of a superior
station.
“Where’s father?” she asked, when
she had kissed them all round, re
pressing with difficulty her emotion
born of affection and compassion at
the sight of her mother’s greying l hair
and the children growing up in neg
lect and deprivation.
“Oh, he’s round the lot some’rs;
he’ll be in d’rec’ly. Come right in,
M’lissy, you’ll find ev’rything jest the
same; we ain’t got nothin’ new an’
nothin’s been done tow’ds fixin’ up
the house,” offering the apology sup
posed by her class to be the correct
speech to a guest, thereby drawing
special attention to that which had
been disparaged, which would in all
probability have escaped close scru
tiny if the apology had been omitted.
Not in this case, however, for in sharp
contrast to the well-kept, commodious
hospital, the squalid appearance of
her old home came as a disagreeable
shock, the climax to the disappoint
ment in her first impression on alight
ing from the train. During her so
journ amid comfortable surroundings
her love for her people had glowed
with a light undimmed by absence,
but her recollection of her bare down
at-the-heel home had faded anfl in its
place an environment similar to her
own had magically grown up. They
were well-to-do, progressive, comfort
able livers and this sudden coining
face to face with the old well-known
and despised stamp that poverty had
set upon the house and its inmates dis
pelled the illusion with a rude ab
ruptness that fairly took her breath.
“Here’s pa,” the chil
dren, as a shuttling step came from
the back of the house and Melissa
‘Jeffersonian
went to meet him, forcing herself to
smile a welcome.
“Well, M’lissy, have you got
here?” was his characteristic greet
ing. He always asked a newcomer if
he 'had arrived, as if to verify the de
ductions of his eyes.
“Glad to see yon, my gal; you look
hearty.”
“Don’t she now! An’ ain’t she im
proved a sight? She’s as stylish
now as Miss Anybody,” admired the
mother.
Melissa thought her father looked
out of healt’li, but refrained from al
luding to the subject, as he made no
complaint. After they had talked for
some time and many questions had
been asked and answered, Mrs. Reed
took notice of the insistent whispers
of the two youngest children, who had
been hanging on the back of her c'hair,
or squirming across her lap, in spite
of repeated injunctions to “go set
down an’ be pretty.”
“Lor’, pa, you’n Billy’d best go
fetch in M’lis’s trunk, there here chil
lern say they want to see it opened.”
Melissa laughed and took from her
bag a box of candy and some little
gifts, which they received with shame
faced delight.
“Now, An’ Mari’, you’n Flory go
see ’bout supper; M’lis’ll be hongry
after travelin’ sich er long ways.”
Sitting on the steps Melissa talked
with her parents while the voices of
the children with their frequent mer
ry laughter, the homely clatter of the
dishes with the lowing of the cows
waiting at the bars, and the whippoor
will’s call from, the woods close by
came a pleasant medley through the
gathering dusk, but no emotions, hap
py, restful and soothing, awoke re
sponsively in the girl’s heart. She
saw that the floors were scrupulously
clean and the yard where the chickens
and pigs wandered at will among the
few neglected flowering bushes was
swept with painstaking care, but the
preparation made in her honor only
appealed to her pathetically, for her
eyes had in the same glance taken in
the gate hanging by its broken hinge,
the palings half down and the general
air of unthrift on every side, and it
robbed her of the joy of home-coming,
as a tiny leaf held close before the
eyes will shut out the most magnifi
cent mountain scenery. The supper
gave further proof of their wish to
celeb rate the reunion as a festal oc
casion, the young sisters vieing with
each other in waiting on Melissa, serv
ing her bountifully with the choicest.
But nothing could keep her from see
ing the lack of refinement that pre
vailed at the table. They ate with
their knives and helped themselves to
bread with their forks. The ham was
fried hard and the biscuits were yel
low with soda, the children ate raven
ously and unrestrictedly.
“I’m choked, ma,” and four-year
old “Baby” pushed his <yip towards
the coffee pot.
“These here children has ’er sly
way er git tin’ more coffee. They
ither git choked or has er sudden
toothache,” and Mrs. Reed smiled in
dulgently as she refilled the thick
china mug. Melissa’s hygienic instinct
often a reflex action with the nurse
