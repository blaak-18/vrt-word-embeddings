iablest lawyers of the New Orleans

- Foster to the seat on the Supreme
Bench recently made vacant by the o
tresference of Judge Parlange to the
R- Federal Court. If we are to judge
Sby-the comments of the press, Mr. S1

the whole State irrespective of fac- I2

ys -The Carencro Dramatic Club,
e would show their public spirit, if
at they would give one of their charm
ar ing entertainments towards the rais
ing of a fund for the building of a
plank walk from the 'Post office to
the corner fronting the church.
Certainly there is no public improve
y ment more greatly needed, or that
n would be more heartily appreciated a

think the matter over, and if the t
. plan receives their approval, success
o is assured:
' -We understand that the roads
between Carencro and Lafayette are
in an almost impassable condition. y
Now that the old contract is dead, (
n would it not be advisable for our r
a Police Jury to gently remind the W

e may be the appointment of others 0
f might work a favorable change. n
Something can be, and should be

o -Some days ago while Master

Sthat a man could jump off easily. Hle sup
posed that conductor Atkinson nad slowed up
tY to let some oui off and paid no further atten
p tion to the occurrence. Qn reaching Dayton
the agent noticed that the car door on the
Yi opposite side from the station was open. He
t. called the messenger, but receiving no an
swer, ordered the train porter to go into the
- car and wake him up. On entering the car
the porter saw the dead body of Richardson
lying on his side. .The alarm was given and
st Dr. Nash, of Liberty, who was aboard, ex
amined the body which was then almost rigid.
The investigation showed that nine shots had
d been fired, seven of whidh had taken effect,
one in the head, three in the breast, twoin
the shoulder, and one in the right arm.
n. The theory is that the robbers secreted
themselves in the car before the train left
n Houston and committed the foul deed near
Green's Bayou, and becoming alarmed at the
noise of the shooting, the murderers applied
e the air brakes and jumped off the train,
d which accounts for their failure to take away
any money.
