(Bureau of Publication and I duration)
WASHINGTON, D. C.. May 12.
Senators Mayfield and Sheppard of
Texas have been requested Dy many
people of Texas to start the federal
law enforcement machinery to work
ing in their state. The San Antonio
and Bexar county district is the
worst affected through lack of law
enforcement, it is charged.
Senator Mayfield immediately upon
receipt of the requests took up the
matter with Attorney General Stone
and federal aid is now being giv
en to this Texas district. The Texas
Rangers have been fighting a single
handed battle without co-operation
from the local authorities, it is said.
Sample Telegrams
Here are a few samples of tele
grams that came to both Texas sena
tors today on the subject and shows
how the good people of Texas are
wrought up over the situation:
“Peace officers and others who ca
ter to the underworld vote say good
citizens exaggerate conditions of
liquor, gambling and vice violations
in Bexar county. Unless our children
and our children’s children can be
protected by law the governor of
this state will be called upon to use
those powers he possesses. We urge
investigation and immediate action.”
Liquor Laws a Joke
“Federal and state liquor laws are
the joke of bootleggers and outlaws
in Bexar county. City, county and
federal law enforcement officers will
not act, and the Texas Rangers are
hindered by those officers, including
the federal district attorney. Pro
tests of good citizens are of no avail,
and if some relief is not granted,
the governor will of necessity be re
quested to act.”

Officers Refuse Aid
“Texas state Rangers are very act
ive in Bexar county, arresting boot
leggers and seizing stills, liquor and
mash. City, county and district
courts have consistently refused aid.
and now federal attorney has like
wise refused assistance in prosecut

NON-MEMBER PRAISES
PRINCIPLES OF KLAN
Vest Virginia Writer Says He
Has Lived and Preached
Americanism
(Bureau of l*til>ll«nllon and Education)
WASHINGTON. D. C., May 5.—A
man out in Huntington, West Vir
ginia. has written to the Bureau of
Publication and Education saying
that he is not a Klansman, but stands
for the things that the Elan espouses.
If he is not a member he ought to be.
judging from the sentiments ex
pressed in the letter. He writes, in
part, as follows:
“I want to say I am not a member
of the Klin, or any other order, but
I have talked the things the three
K’s stand for all my life.
“America for Americans, Protest
antism; our glorious public schools;
against private and porachial schools;
kick the foreigners out of both hous
es of congress in Washington; keep
the white people on top; let Ameri
cans run America, etc.
“I am of old colonial and revolu
tionary stock; was born in the U. S.
A., but had to wait 21 years before
I could vote. Foreigners can come
in here and vote long before our
American boys; that is not fair or
right.
‘There is only one thing I hold
against the K. K. K., and that is
that they do not shoot hack enough
when other people shoot at them. It
is a dirty shame when Americans
cannot have an order of their own in
their own country while every Tom,
Dick and the devil from oversea?
who come over here can start an or
ganization here to carry on their
propaganda. That’s all right in their
estimation, but Americans must not
retaliate. Rot on such argument.
Too many of our fool people pat
those kind on the back.
‘There are many Americans in this
country just like myself who do not
belong to the K. K. K. but are with
it heart and soul. We are with it in
spirit and sympathy and stand for
the same things, talk for it and are
willing to fight for it if it ever be
comes necessary to do so,
“I for one believe we ought to
have a good American third party
with good Americans at the head oi
it. Let’s go.”
Iron Range City
Kluxes Merrily
VIRGINIA. MINN.. May 7.—The lo
cal unit of the Ku Klux klan is mov
ing forward by leaps and bounds. To
night a national lecturer of the Prot
estant order delivered a powerful ad
dress which stirred every person pres
ent and resulted in a quite satisfac
tory increase in membership. Noth
ing under heaven can atop the Klan
in this city. Every concerted action
of opposition does nothing more than
hurry the building of the inevitable
K. K. K. organization of real strength.
The Klan In Virginia is no longer in
its swaddling clothes, hut stands a
mighty youth working night and day
without wearying for those things
that will make St. Louis county a
better place for all people regardless
of creed or color who believe in the
fundamentals of American civilisa
tion. The only forces here that fear
the Ku Klux Klan are alien-minded
and entirely out of harmony with the
ideals, traditions, principles and in
stitutions of this country.
Indiana Klansmen
Visit Two Churches
GOSPORT, IND.—Twenty-two robed
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan visited
the Shiloh Methodist church here re
cently and presented the pastor, Rev.
R. 1. Black, a gift of S4O, with which
to make needed repairs on the
church. The following evening the
Klansmen visited the Gosport Bap
tist church, where the Rev. A. L. Tid
rick had been conducting revival
services, and praaantad him an en

THE FIERY CROSS
Ether Wares
Church and School
(From The Manchester Guard Inn,
Manchester, England)
There was a fine contrast between
the broad views on education ex
pressed at the “Copec” conference
(Conference on Christian politics,
economics, and citizenship) in Bir
mingham and the old sectarian wran
gling which once seemed inevitable
when religion met education in debate.
Emphasis was laid by the representa
tives of the various churches on the
common responsibility for the crea
tion of an instructed and thoughtful
community. What this means in
practice is the extension of the secon
dary and adult education, and it is on
these points that the Christian ethic
of respect for all human personality
should be a call to public action. For
it has been the chief weakness of our
national educational system that it
was originally based on rigid strati
fications of class. What reformers
have had to wear down is the old
view that there are two deeply divid
ed classes of pupils—the minority,
to whom secondary school and univer
sity are a right, however little use
they may be likely to make of them;
and the majority, who can expect no
more than a primary schooling, how
ever much taleni and eagerness they
may show. That fatal and manifest
ly un-Christian division has been con
siderably bridged in late years. Be
between 1895 and 1919 the proportion
of the pupils in secondary schools to
the whole population was quadrupled,
and Lancashire, which was found by
the royal commission of 1895 to be a
particularly black spot, became com
paratively virtuous. But the bridges
from primary to secondary schools
are still far too few and too small
for the two and a half million boys
and girls between the ages of four
teen and eighteen who should be us
ing them. Where the churches car
render invaluable help is in Terming
the public opinion that will demand
extensions just as they have undoubt
edly helped to filter instructed and
progressive opinion about the League
of Nations. Few people nowa< a;s
will openly support the theory that
pupils should be given educations
opportunities only according to th«
social and economic status of tht
parents. But there are many who lei
themselves be daunted by the practi
cal difficulties and who swallow un
critically the preposterous notior
that education is a seemingly inev
it able “burden,” like armaments
which must be whittled away to pro
duce prosperity. The “Copec” con
ference gave sure signs of a strom
Christian opposition to that wretch
ed doctrine and of a will to insis
that the 660.000 British children wh<
reach the age of fourteen every yea
should have a better chance than a
present of avoiding immediate pre
cipitation into industry or, which i
worse, of immediate compulsion t
loaf without employment about th
streets.

last week donated $12.50 to the col

A letter of appreciation, assuring the

PRESIDENT APPROVES
OUTDOOR RECREATION
20,000,00© Illiterates and Near-
Illiterates in United
States
WASHINGTON, D. C., May 12.
The recommer.dat ion of President
Coolidge that greater attention be
given to open-air recreation, ami the
calling of a conference to discuss
the subject, are receiving approval by
social workers and public spirited
citizens. That the people should be
encouraged to more outdoor activi
ties is obvious, and efforts to this end
are most commendable.
There is a growing feeling, howev
er, that the more important subject
of education is not receiving the at
tention it deserves. President Cool
idge in his first message to congress
stressed the needs of popular educa
tion and recommended the creation
of a department of education, but
that was the end of it so far as con
gressional action is concerned. There
is no subject of greater importance
to the nation or fraught with more
significance than the promotion of
popular education.
With twenty million illiterates
and near-illiterates in this country,
with public school facilities far be
low the demand, with millions of
children denied the right of educa
tion. in both cities and rural districts,
with vast alien populations unable to
speak or read English, the problem
of popular education takes the posi
tion of first rank.
There is an increasing sentiment
throughout the country that the
claims of education cannot longer be
ignored. The condition of illiteracy
is becoming acute, and the people
will not much longer tolerate the
side-tracking of the problem out of
consideration for personal ambitions
and partisan expediency.
Promote open-air recreation, but at
the same time definite legislative ac
tion should be taken to meet the
more important question.
NEW DISKS REPLACE
SEMAPHORE SIGNALS
Three Lights to Give Warn
ing on Railroad*.
Coshocton, O. —The old semaphore
railroad signal system Is doomed, ac
cording to officials of the Pennsylvania
railroad in charge of the Installation
here of new automatic disks which are
being installed at a local tower, one
of four towers at which such systems
are being Installed between Pittsburgh
and Columbus.
In the place of semaphore arms they
are erecting signal posts along the
tracks, upon each of which Is mounted
a huge disk, with lenses upon it. They
are operated by levers—both the auto
matic and mechanical systems—Just as
were the semaphores. The signals of
old In principle are retained—hori
zontal position means stop, a 45-degree
angle, caution, and a vertical position,
clear. But rows of three lights now
give those signals Instead of sema
phore arms.
The new system provides additional
protection and safety. It was claimed,
through Interlocking switch and signal
devices and through absolute automatic
blocking. As soon as a train passes
a clear signal the horizontal row of
three lights—s stop signal—lmmedi
ately takes tbs place of the vertical
row of lights.

Junior Klan Is To
Start in Oklahoma
and Arkansas Next
Oklahoma and Arkansas next! Yes.
sir, that's the Juniors’ program. The
Divisional Director of the Junior Ku
Klux Klan for the district covering
these states has already been appoint
ed and is on the job. Active opera
tion of the various Junior Klans
throughout the states o{ Oklahoma
and Arkansas will start within the
next few weeks.
Gradually states have fallen into
line with the Junior Ku Klux Klan
organization for Protestant Ameri
can, boy patriots. The Junior Ku
Klux Klan starter operation in the
Hoosier state just nine months ago,
and from there spread to Ohio, Michi
gan, West Virginia and New Jersey.
The growth in all these states has
been most pleasing, and Juniors have
built their local organizations to
strong units in every district. With
the strength in the Junior Ku Klux
Klan, put there and kept there by the
boys themselves, the organization is
now going into two more states that
are “rarin’ to go” into the principles
of real Junior Ku Klux Klankraft.
As soon as the Junior Ku Klux Klan
is started in these states, the nation
al director promises action on other
states who have sent in many re
quests that the Junior order be estab
lished within their bounds. The next
states after Oklahoma and Arkansas
are Louisiana, Oregon, Kansas and
Missouri.
The Junior Ku Klux Klan is grow
ing and will continue to grow. This
spring and summer will see many
new states added to the list of those
in which the great Protestant Ameri
can patriotic order for boys, the Jun
ior Ku Klux Klan, will be started.
Junior Klansmen will remember
that only a comparatively short time
ago. West Virginia and New Jersey
entered the ranks of Junior Klan
kraft, and now both states have
strong, active Junior Klans through
out their borders. All states are now
seeing the need of such an order, in
which the Protestant American boys
of the country receive not only the
wholesome companionship of Chris
tian gentlemen, and an atnletic train
ing that will better fit them to meet
the strains of later life, but also are
taught the fundamental principles of
true American government.
In every state in which the Junior
Ku Klux Klan goes, the senior or
ganizations not only give it their en
dorsement, but back it and work for
it. For the fathers and mothers in
the seniors’ organization realize the
need for such an organization for
their sons, and for the sons of others.
They realize that the early training
will build a stronger Klan for the
future, and that their sons are get-
ting the proper associations, the prop
er knowledge, and the right spirit of
American patriotism when they be
come affiliated with the Junior Ku
Klux Klan
Oklahoma and Arkansas senior or
ganizations are strong. They, as
much as the boys of these states .are
eager for the Junior organization—
and the Junior Ku Klux Klan of these
two states is going to take a running
start that wdll cause some of the old
er Junior Klans to keep on the hump
if they expect to hold down honors in
activities and membership.
Louisiana, Oregon, Kansas and Mis
souri also have strong senior organi
zations, and with the other two
states coming into the organization,
it seems as if ‘The Big Six” newcom
ers are going to give ‘The Big Five”
old-timers some sure-enough “bat
tles” for leadership in Junior Ku Klux
Klan circles.

CONGRESS MAY QUIT
THIS MONTH OR JUNE
Insurgents Part Company With
Democrats in Making Po
litical Capital
(Bureau of Publication and Kdueatlua)
WASHINGTON. D. C., May 12.
Something has happened in Washing
ton. Things nave changed, and it be
gins to look more and more like an
adjournment of congress yet this
month or early next month, so that
members can get away from their
legislative duties in time to attend
both national conventions in June.
This change of heart on the part
of a good many members of congress
has come about rather suddenly, and
most of them are wondering why. It
is said the insurgent Republicans
have joined hands with the regular
Republicans in this move, and this is
an unusual thing at this session, as
the insurgents have been voting with
the Democrats most of the time.
The Democrats are inclined te
hang on and try to make all the po
litical capital for the campaign they
can possibly manufacture, but the in
surgents have parted company with
them on this proposition, and they
will vote with the regular Republi
cans to clean up the legislative slate
and make a quick get-away from
Washington within 30 days.
With the insurgents and the Re
publicans united on this move they
can bring about an adjournment when
they want to, and this is what is go
ing to happen. The insurgents them
selves admit this change of frost
and they profess to be able to see ne
reason wny congress should tarry
here much longer. They seem to be
as anxious as the regulars to get
back home and spend the summer
talking to the voters.
The insurgents have not quarreled
with the Democrats, and they are
not disputing their sincerity; they
are simply going their own way and
pursuing their own ideas. They seem
suddenly to want to get home and
eet out among the voters and give
them explanations of their conduct
and get the ground ready for harvest,
which will come next November.
