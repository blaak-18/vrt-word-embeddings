National Campaign Notes.
The Young Men’s Democratic League
of Atlanta finds itself in a state of agita
tion. What is the matter, kids? Not
“skeered,” are you?
Keep on calling for Bryan. Maybe he
will come, after awhile. Even the doodle
comes, you know, if you call long enough.
“Thou shalt not steal,” is the subject
of one of Bryan’s pious stunts. Neverthe
less, he is stealing the Watson-Williams
vote in Nebraska, by running Bryanites
on the People’s Party electoral ticket. To
steal a vote isn’t wrong, unless Bryan is
the loser. To steal votes that do not be
long to him is no violation of the com
mand, “Thou shalt not steal” —else Bryan
wouldn’t do it.
The Cosmopolitan Club of New York
has for its purpose the practice of Social
Equality and of intermarriage between
negroes and white people. They gave a
banquet, a few months ago, at which ne
gro men sat down to eat and drink with
white women. They are to give another
such banquet in October.
THE SECRETARY OF THIS SO
CIAL EQUALITY CLUB IS OUT
MAKING SPEECHES FOR MR.
BRYAN.
We trust that the Young Men’s Demo
cratic League of Atlanta will not be in
formed of this. The Kids are already
very unhappy.
*
The Rev. Dr. Corrothers, negro divine
of eminent respectability, is likewise out
making speeches for Bryan. To his au
dience of negroes in Washington, D. C.,
the Reverend Doctor declared:
“LET US VOTE FOR MR. BRYAN,
A MAN WHO WILL ENFORCE THE
14TH AND 15TH AMENDMENTS.”
And the audience roared with enthusi
astic approval.
HOW LONG WILL IT BE BEFORE
SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS COMPEL
MR. BRYAN TO REPUDIATE THE
SUPPORT OFFERED TO HIM ON
THOSE GROUNDS?
n
Say, Vardaman! How do you like that
kind of negro talk?
THE JEFERSONIAN.
How do you like it, Governor Broward?
And what do you think of it, Senator
Culberson ?
Is it HONEST, in Bryan, to allow the
negro leaders to support him upon the
ground that he will either combat the
Southern disfranchisement laws, or will
favor the cutting down of Southern rep
resentation in Congress ?
What evidence has Bryan given to
these negroes which convinces them that
he sides with them on these vital matters?
The question is a fair one, gentlemen,
and IT MUST BE MET.
You are sitting still, uttering no word
of protest, while Bryan is niggerizing the
Democratic party. Speak out, gentlemen !
The negro leaders went to see Taft
about the Brownsville matter, about the
Foraker bill to re-instate the negro troops,
about the Southern disfranchisement
laws, and about the 14th and 15th amend
ments. From Taft they got no satisfac
tion.
They then went to see Mr. Bryan about
those same matters. He talked with them,
and they came away rejoicing—PER
FECTLY SATISFIED.
WHAT DID BRYAN SAY TO
THOSE NEGROES?
THE SOUTH HAS A RIGHT TO
KNOW.
*
In his Jefferson Day banquet speech
in Chicago, 1905, Mr. Bryan declared:
“The time has come for the Democratic
Party to declare in favor of Government
Ownership of the railroads.”
Evidently, W. J. B. was mistaken, just
as he was when he vowed and vociferated
against national banks, the gold standard,
and asset currencv.
Well, there's one good thing in being
a rock-ribbed Democrat —you don’t have
to use the same ribs all the time. If
you're a Bryan Democrat, you get a new
set of ribs every year, or so.
Which is also very consoling, as Mr.
Pecksniff would say. Or did that cele
brated moralizer use the word “comfort
ing”?
*
The things which Bryan solemnly calls
his “principles” have undergone all sorts
of changes, but that' cast-iron smile of his
stays put. Two such smiles never smiled
at each other as the two which met when
Bryan, the Peerless, shook hands with
Murphy, the Tammany boss.
And it would have given much pleasure
to each of .the smilers to have been able
to insert a keen-bladed knife under the
fifth rib of the other.
Yet in 1896, when Bryan was running
with his cronies, Sewall and Watson, he
was so pure that he scornfully refused to
keep company with Tom Taggart.
So great has been the decadence of
Bryan that the corruptest and most crimi
nal of all politicians, Murphy, is a wel-
com guest at the Bryan home, and Tom
Taggart, the gambling-hell man, was al
lowed to dictate the vice-presidential
nomination;
A~ Standard Oil man, like Guffey r of
Pennsylvania, is thrown out because he
isn’t for Bryan any more, while a Stand
ard Oil man, like Dave Francis, of Mis
souri, is told to come up higher, because
he is still for Bryan.
Verily, the Peerless One is a team—a
whole team.
The strategy of the Bryan campaign
consists in the effort to reap for Bryan
the benefit of the indignation which the
negroes feel about the Brownsville af
fair. In other words, Mr. Bryan is craft
ily capitalizing, as a political asset, the
wrath which Roosevelt and Taft aroused
in the negroes when they, Roosevelt and
Taft, took the white man's side of that
squabble.
Now, suppose Bryan succeeds with his
wily scheme, —what wilt be the result?
HE WILL OWE HIS ELECTION
TO THE NEGRO VOTE.
Could anything more calamitous be
fall the country?
If the negro leaders can prove to their
race that they have been able to decide
a presidential election, who could fix the
limit of their arrogance, their demands
for patronage and recognition?
What are Southern Congressmen, edi
tors, and leaders of thought doing that
they can not see the terrible menace of
Bryan’s abnormally selfish and unscrupu
lous grasping for office?
H M it
Government <By Injunction.
The Jeffersonian believes that the Hon.
Samuel Gompers thinks he is doing right
when he tries to deliver the labor vote
to Bryan, but we also believe that he is
making the mistake of his life. He is
going to do more harm to the labor unions
than Van Cleave can ever do with that
half-a-million campaign fund of his. The
course of Mr. Gompers is splitting the
labor men into factious groups, and a
bitterness will be engendered which will
injuriously affect unionism for years.
The Central Labor Union of Pennsyl
vania is angrily threatening to get out an
injunction against Mr. Gompers!
Now, wouldn’t it be comical to see the
Labor Unions tie one another up with
injunctions?
Commenting upon the orders issued by
Mr. Gompers to the effect that a Bryan
ite should be made the president of the
Central Labor Union, Frank Feeny, presi
dent of the C. L. U», says
“He (Gompers) has been saying, all
along that he did not believe in one-man
power, or government by injunction, but
in a trial by jury—and what did his rep
resentative do yesterday?
“He rendered a decision that was worse
than anv arbitrary power a judge could
have exerted.”
If Feeny getp out an injunction against
