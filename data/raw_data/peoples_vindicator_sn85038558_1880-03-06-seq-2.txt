VUUVOIDABL DELA,. I
Some oomplalat is being made
about the slowness with whlobh leg
islaton is being perfected. Those
who make euch complalante are
evidently unlrmiliar with the pro.
visions of the new constitution. It
there is no delay or obestruoton o
any nature, a bill cannot go through P
both houes of the General Asseme.
bly in less than two weeks. If there
is obetructioo, whloh is to be espeot t
ed from the opponents of every mea
sure, a muoh longer time is required,.
and an active minority may derer Its it
psasage several days longer. Under n,
favorable circumstances a bill mat
become a law in three weeks after 1' of
as l9nroouced, but it can easily be d e.
layed a week longer. This is the re N
auit of a direct constitutional msan. of
date to tbe Legislature. Notie of a t,,
bill must be given, it must be read il N
each house on three separate days, ,.(
aend it must be referred after th, to
irst readlng to a committee. The lo
committee rarely reports it back rot u
oation within less than a week. U(Jov
tier the old constitution the rule
could be suepended and a bill rushed
through both bouses in two days'
time, and In excepilonal cases, it hb d
been done in a single day. Much ot
usd legislation was the consequences
t'be const itulionu convention sough'
to guard against tis in thbe futore b)
adoptin constitutional rules whlos q,
the Legislature could not suspend.
As a result, we have the delay com.
,laoned ot-and the enactment ot
much better laws. Under the pres.
eat system no law mon beoeacted us i e
1it ass been properly omtiulaed. e
ehloh must be acknowledged to be a
else provislOn. q
a large number of bills have tr
reached that stage when they will
sooume laws as soon as they are
reached on the oalendar. This will 1
be done next week, when a number
-i Important measure will go to the
Governor for hbI approval.
I may add that the two Houses SI
enerally eo through their calendars I
eoh day before adjourning. Those U
familiar with Iseghatures and thel, di
methods, will understand that noth- sa
tog more should be expected, me c
uthing more can be done without pa
violating all parliamentary rule, o to
