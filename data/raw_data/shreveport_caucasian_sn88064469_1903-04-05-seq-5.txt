that any so-t of an old body will do to

The more splendid and beautiful
clothing there is piled upon an ugly,
ungraceful body the more hideous It
looks by contrast. If women cared less
for elaborate clothes and more for
beautiful bodies to hang them on, the
human race would rapidly grow to
ward, perfection. Every woman not
positively defornyed can make her body
beautiful and graceful by industriously
and perseveringly using means within
the reachi of all. Natural and hygienic
physical culture Is the means. Ameri

A young wife lately tried to commit
suicide because for the first time her

Never mind, young woman. Just stay

you won't mind it. There are wives
who feel like committing suicide be

nights.

Easter morning and you'll see the
smart people dressed exactly as they -
are every other Sunday. Time was
when there was a wild scramble to get
into new clothes on Easter (lay. No
matter how inappropriate the clothes
or how inclement the weather, the two
had to go together willy nilly. Airy
creitioas of tulle enveloped necks that
yearned for furs. and openwork straw
tilted itself coquettishly over noses
blue with the raw wind. To wear one's
winter clothes, one's felt hat above all,
was a' disgrace almost beyond expres
sion. Mothers slaved that their daugh
ters might have an Easter outfit; girls
worked. stitched away patiently into
the wee small hours of holy week and
even denied themselves necessary
things that they might dazzle their
neighbors and rivals on Easter day.
From Grand street to Fifth avenue the
craze was the same. Thank the Lord.
that Is over! If it's warm on Easter
day, you see stcaw hats and silk gowns.
If it's warm before Easter, you see the
same hats and gowns. On the other
hand, if It's cool on Easter day, for a
fortnight after Easter you will see
heavy garments. We are no longer
swayed by a certain day."
"But you can't put the florists out of
style!"
"No; they have remained over from
the old Easter. People don't send the
ridiculous and useless Easter gifts they
used to. Instead they give a pot of
blossoming ilauts or a little hunch of
cut spring flowers just to herald the
coming of the spring. These floral
gifts are more elaborate this year than
ever. by the way, and it's quite a fad
to send with the flowers an odd vase.
into which the stems are slipped. For
instance, a bunch of violets should be
placed in a little copper bowl of the
sort displayed in the florist's windows.
orchids should rest in a dainty holder
of opalescent glass. etc. Even the sim
plest pot of spirisa which goes out Is
wrapped in pink and white tissue pa
per, plaited after the fashion of a dan
cer's skirts and tied with a big bow of
ribbon. And, speaking of spirteas. I
want to say that one kind hearted rich
woman sent a thousand pots of these
pretty white blossoms to the sick peo
ple in the hospitals last year, which
shows that we still do have an Easter
feeling, but it's a sensible one instead
of a silly, extravagant one"
"And the children's Easter?"
"Oh, that's always with us - the
wonderful sugar eggs, with a peephole
through which one can catch glimpses
of fairyland; the rabbits, the wee
chicks, and, above all, the wonderful
eggs so popular for children's parties!
These are covered with artificial flow
ers and open by means of a spring, dis
closing as many smaller eggs as there
are little guests present, each small
egg being filled with candy. Take it
all in all, I think the children get the
best of Easter, just as they do, for that
matter, with every holiday throughout
the year." MAUD ROBINSON.
