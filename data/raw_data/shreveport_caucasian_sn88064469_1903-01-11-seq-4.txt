being free and 1ntra1tncled. gives ex
pression to its ric s in its OWn peculiar
style'. Yet at tilllmes, its symnpathy may
lie a's teler and as gentle as that of a
woiman. Since the defeat of the proposi
tion to vote a special tax in aid of the
Carnegie library "rich men" and "cap
italists" have been criticised in indefin
ite terms because they contributed to
the defeat of the tax. The critics have
not viewed the question practically, and
it may be said that the tax would not
have been defeated if the Caucasian's
editor had not pointed out to several of
his friends the objections against the
Carnegie proposition. As sensible, prac
ticable to'n the objections were consid
ered in a conservatnve spirit and the
result is historical Instead of being
criticised, the gentlemen wholt contri
buted to the defeat of the Carnegie
proposition should be commended.
On this score we reproduce fromn The

the two men were moved by a different
principle: George Peabody'- gifts were
not stringotined: lie gave for the sake
of humanity. Think of nine million of
tmoney being given away Ito por andl
needy! Such is the record to the credit
of (;orge Peabody. Consider Pea
h dy's gifts of millions to help the poor
(,f Loundon! Think of Geoerge Peabody
eing tendered the freedom (iof the city
of London in a godl box : of (;eorge
Pelabodly, born in 'Danvers, Mass.. on
February iX. 1793, of poor but respect
able parents. an American, receiving
special recognition from Queen Vic
toria. and a miniature portrait of her
iself. in a massive gold frame. in appre
ciatimo of his munificence: of Geoerge
Pcalody's statue in bronze standing
near the Royal Exchange, London; of
George Peabody being welcomed by
children strewing his way with flowers.
Yet George Peabody was an American.
Think of his gifts of millions to the
South for purposes of education. Think
of Peabody as a man who gave to iml
proae the condition of the pc or and un
fortunate,. to alleviate humanity. When
Peabody died in London, lihe received
the highest honors, and Queen Victoria
had his remtains convcyed to this coutn
try in her nobllest man-of- ar MI.on
arch." Bit it is needles,, to( continule
this subject since a lp.rtal of Mr. Pea
toy'lvs liography may he ohbtained and
rc;ti with interest. \Ve uist adllt it, in
all candor. that whihle the Carnegie li
bIrary. in a tmngni icenlt edifice, would be
an ornament and sonlme attraction, still
the conditioms and the cost of miaiitcn
once would not justify the tax for such
a lunxuary. In no personal seunse, we
cite. however, the example of George
Peabodly. which Mr. Carnegie could
follow in the distribution of his mil
lions. We could never fancy any dona
tion with a string-tied annex or condi
tions. and therefore could not regard
the library proposition with favor.
From this view of the question we con
sider. all adverse criticism of the defeat
of the tax unjust.
LINCOLN'S PICTURE.
Some of the ex-Confederate camps of
Mississippi are protesting against the
placin of the painting of Lincoln in
the hall of fame of the new capitol
building and censuring Dunbar Row
land, the State historian, for asking the
Lincoln family for it. Mr. Rowland's
mistake.-was not unnatural. During the
campaign for president, through which
'the coptnr y last passed. the Democratic
1candidat.at, t 4i: ad 'of the ticket went
up .aid-dbwn the land preachiig Lin
coln. quoting Lincoln and making him
the patron saint of Democracy.-Com
mercial Appeal.,
Lincoln's picture in its place is not
objectionable, but when singled out in
opposition to the Southern mans ideal.
I then it should be set aside. There is
little in Mt. Lincoln's political life
'which can appeal to a Southern boy; a
boy whose grandfather or father was a
follower of Lee, or Jackson. or John
stoni. por should Lincoln's picture be
singled out of all the president's of the
United States for an adornment in any
schools of the South. There is too much
of the spirit of "the toady" and of
"flunkeyis'm" connected with some
schools in which the children of South
tin men aad wornlen are taught. l.f pic
tures of illustrious men are desired as
ornaments why not select Washington
and Lincoln and Jefferson Davis and
General R. E. Lee for practical illus
trations of teaching in noble manhood
and patriotism. Why single out Lincoln
and not Washington? Why Lincoln
alone in any school of the South?
Judge Alton B. Parker of New York
is coming more and more into promi
nence as a presidential candidate. He is
popular in New York and there is no
stain on his record. Neither Hill nor
Gorman can unite the party, and Parker
seems to be the coming man.--Guardian
Journal.
Of 75.000.000 of people the Demo
eratic party will no doubt settle on a
leader who will secure victory over the
Republicans, but we do not think Judge
Parker is the man. Hill is politically
as dead as Gorman and your Uncle
Grover.

The~late Dr. Newman Hall's first at
tempt at outdoor preaching was to a
company of hop pickers in his native
town of Maidstone. ills address was
short and to the point, and so great
was his inherent nervonsness and dif
fidence that he went unattended by
any friend. One of his first regular
sermons as a student was preached on
June 28, 1838, in the town hall of the
same place, the occasion being the
memorable one of Queen Victoria's cor
onation. The text taken for the ser
mon was "The King of kings and Lord
of lords." Newman Hall was one of
the very few ministers who preached
at both the coronation and diamond
jubilee iservices of the late queen, and
on the latter ccasion-June 20, 1897
he again preached from the same text
with a full heart and a host of remem
brances.-London Chronicle.
