At th3 expiration of sixteen days, tlie men

said 4'he would take thein out this time alive,

"I had known Captain Coles," says Cap
tain Morgan, as well as my brother. When
he came out of his dungeon, I swear to you I
did net know him. liis face hat! swollen to
two or three times its ordinary size, and he
tottered so that I hail to catch him tu keep him
from falling. Captain Barton was hi an awful
state. His face was swollen and tlie blood was
bursting from the skin. All of 'hem had to he
watched, so as to check them in eating, as they
had beem starved s , long.'' .
Captain Morgan was si fortunate a? t" ob
tain a transfer to Johnston's Island, whence,
alter being carried to Point Lookout, he was
exchanged. He says thu when 44 hs got into
Reast Butler's hands he felt as if be had been
translated to Paradise."
Is there any authority in Riehmoud that
w ill cr-a.k a thumb to save these men, who
are not only fle-h of our JJesh, but the defend
ers of those in this capital, who, not exactly
disowning them, undertake the base and cow
ardly pretence of ignoring their fate?.
What is the Confederate definition of re
taliation?" Captain Morgan says that on
his way dewn the bay to Fortress Monroe he
met Colonel Straight that this famous 44 hos
tage" was fat and rubicund ; that he spoke
freely of his prison eiperienc-i in Richmond,
and com plained only that he had to eat corn
bread. This appeared to be the extent of his
sufferings, and the. limit of Confederate re
taliation. In Philadelphia, on the 16th, the 44 minis
ter " appointed to take charge of all the
Methodic -churches in the city of Ne-w Or
leans was publicly presented with a Yankee
flag. Iu his speech accepting it he declared
that he was for subjugation or 44 war forever."
Major The. D. Armary and Lieu tr. Divi,
of the Confederate army, have been convicted
of recruiting within the enemv's lines and
sentenced to imprisonment, with hard labor,
for fifteen years. They are now iu Fort
Warren.

oti Ik the 10th ifist., says: It is understoo.1
that Gen. (irant jirotests against juj further
aiicmpt to penetrate the Confederacy until
Kichmund shail have been taken. He disa

est value upon ' the rebel capital, declaring
that Cincinnati as well as Washington is

Another correspondent say : " In the new
