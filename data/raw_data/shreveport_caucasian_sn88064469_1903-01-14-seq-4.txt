SLAIN BY A WOMAN.
Student Killed by Mrs. Efie L. Carson
Over Alleged Stander.
Macmi. Ga., Jan. 14.-Mrs. Effle L.
Carson, wife of a railroad machinist,
formerly the wife of Ernest Thomp
son, a printer, shot anr instantly kill
ed Robert A. Rigsby. a student in a
business college here. The tragedy
took place in the law office of Mar
maduke C. Bayne, an attorney, to
whom she had gone for advice. She
shot the man twice in the head and
once through the hea-t. She emptied
her revolver, the other shot, going
wild. She at once delivered herself
to the sheriff, going across the street
with the smoking weapon in her
hand.
Mrs. Carson was promptly placed
ia&jail, but was subsequently released
on a bond of $1000.
The coroner's jury found a verdict
I of voluntary manslaughter.
Mrs. Carter was a teacher of tele
graphy in another business college.
She charged that Rigsby had circulat
ed stories damaging to her character
and had gone to the lawyer with a
paper for Rigsby to sign. exonorating
her. The lawyer took the paper to
the college and submitted it to Rigs
by, who declined to sign, but asked a
personal interview. He went to the
lawyers office and immediately asked
the lawyer and his stenographer to
step into the hall. 'The door was at
once locked. In a few moments the
shots rang out and Mrs. Carson ap
peared announcing that she had kill
ed the man.
Rigsby was found on the floor dead
with his own revolver near his fight
hand. What occurred between them
is not known except for an admission
by Mrs. Carson that he applied an
opprobrious epithet to her. Rigsby
was originally from Bowling Green,
Ky., or a village near by, and is said
to be a member of a family prominent
there. He had conducted a business
college in Tampa, Fla., but had come
to Macon to complete his education,
intending to open another college in
June. He was about twenty-five
years of age.
