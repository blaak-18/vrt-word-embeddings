BOBT. P. HUNTER,

We are done with our paper

attacked and we answered... We
shall not hereafter notice anything
that may come from that source—
through the columns of this paper.
ty Ihe ward election of dele

THE STATE CONVENTION.
As one of the delegates from the
Mass Meeting of the White Man's
Party ot this Parish, we attended
the Convention at Baton Bouge,
from whence we returned by Stage
on Thursday last. The Convention
was the largest, most harmonious
and enthusiastic, ever held in thin
State. There were over two hun
dred delegates, and numbers of
visitors who cainc to see and hear.
Pike's llall, the largest in the place
was crowded to its utmust capacity.
A flue brass band was in attend
ance—the Hall was handsomely
decorated, and every préparation
made by the citizens of Baton
Bouge, who boio alone all the ex
penses, to make the delegates com
fortable. We doubt very much if
ever in the history of Louisiana, a
Convention assembled su marked
for its intelligence, respectability
and harmony. Louisiana's truest
and best sons were there to repre
sent her, and to consult as to her
best interests m this her hour of
sore tiial, and right well did they
show their appreciation of the im
portance of the occasion, and the
magnitude of the issues involved.
Every face bore the marks of deter
mination, and every voice proclaim
ed the necessity for harmony and
unity. The representatives of all
the shades of political opinion
among the white people were there,
and all were willing to give up their
predilections and to forget, their
prejudices for the sake of peace and
unanimity iu our ranks.
The selection of Mr. It. H. Marr,
as permanent President of the
Convention was most fortunate,
aud to him in a great measure, is
the State indebted for bringing
about the harmony which prevail
ed throughout. Iiis election was
made by a rising, unanimous and
enthusiastic vote. The ovation
tendered to him by such a repre
sentative Convention of all the peo
ple, was a just and merited return
for his usefulness aud heroic labors
for his State, and was one of which
his descendants for generations to
come may well be proud. No man
but one, ever had such a hold i pon
the affections of the whole people o'
Louisiana, as that grand and glori
ous tribute proved that Robert H.
Marr has, and that man was Hen
ry W. Allen. Marr lives to receive
the enthusiastic testimonial of the
esteem and confidence of his coun
trymen; and Allen sleeps in the
grave of a hero, to be cherished as
the bravest of the brave, the knight
liest of the knightly, and the no
blest, of the noble sons whose m?m
ory is the proud privilege of Louis
ianians to enshrine in their hearts,
and to keep alive upou the bright
est page of their State's history.
The twin heroes of the sword aud
pen, the dead Allen, aud the living
Marr, will live in story and song,
as long as Louisiana lies a son to
do reverence to exalted patrio r ism,
or a voice to speak the praise ot
virtue without stain, honor without
a blemish, aud knightly courage
which counted no odds and yielded
to no enemy.
To the Committee of Twety-One
also is due much credit and praise.
They were in session from 8 o'clock
iu the morning until 5 in the even
ing, without intermission, and with
out any of them leaving tho room.
They were three hours discussing
the six lines of the preamble to
their resolutions. It was fortunate
for the State that the Committee
was composed of such men as it
was, for any division among them
would have brought up discussion,
wrangling and bitter feeling iu the
Convention. Their unanimity made
it possible to adopt their report
with the wild enthusiasm aud ris
ing vote that cut oft all discussion.
Throughout the two days the most
complete harmony prevailed ; there
was but little attempt at discussion,
and even that little was discourag
ed by the Convention.
The day of the redemption of Lou
isiana is at hand, and she may well
be gratified that the Convention
united all the opposing elements
aud succeeded in bringing about
the unanimity which leaves no
doubt of our success, and the over
throw ot Radicalism iu the ap
f-reaching »»lection.
The Parish Convention.
Upon this day wpek our parish
Convention is to assemble iiud they
will have duties to perform of the
utmost importance to Rapides. The
selection ot the proper candidates
to fill the parish offices is a duty
which will require on the part of
the Convention the utmost circum
spection and caution. We are in a
crisis where it is imperatively de
manded that the very best men
shall be put forward, and no office
given because some candidate may
desire it. The only test should be
capacity and honesty, for we are
waging a war U |h>ii the negioes for
filling the offices with incapable and
dishonest men, and while any and
all of the candidates and nominees
will lie honest, it is equally impor
tant, that they should be capable.—
We do not intend these remarks to
apply to any of the candidates
whose ii/imes we have heard men
tioned for offices. As some of thein
are for the same office, the duty of
the Convention will be to select the
most'capable.
We deprecate the previous an
nouncement of candidates this time
because we have advocated the pol
icy that the office should hunt the
man, aud not the mau the office.—
The Mass Meeting announced this
policy and we are satisfied that it is
a wise one. The Convention should'
have been left entirely untrainmel
ed in this respect, and combina
tions, electioneering, etc., for this
one time ought to have been done
away with. Although applied to,
the Caucasian has not made anyau
iiouuceiuent8 for this very reason.
We are well aware that it is sanc
tioned by custom and that in itself
there is and can be nothiug dispar
aging ill so doing, the candidates
through the press merely saying
that if they are chosen they will
serve, but these are peculiar times
and the sentiment of the people is
opposed to office hunting. One's
friends have of couksc the right
among themselves to discuss the
name of any one for any particular
office, and to put his n.iine in nomi
nation in the Convention, but let
there be no combination* or com
promises. If any man is not strong
enough fc> carfy the Convention oil
his own merits, he ought not to
have the nomination.
We have not had in our mind any
candidate or set of candidates in
making the above remarks and
hope they will not be construed as
applying to any one personally.—
We speak for the good of Bapides
alone.
The Fair Association.
We again appeal to the subscri
beis of stock to the Fair Associa
tion, to come forward and pay their
subscriptions. If parties can not
pay the full amount at present let
them pay what they can now, as
the Board of Directors are in need
of assistance. Those who subscrib
ed at the last meeting, and who
promised to pay before their next
meeting in October, will be called
upon before that time to pay up—
and certificates of stock be issued
to them. It must be remembered
that the Board of Directors have
incurred responsibilities on the
good faith of the subscribers, and
the charter requires that all per
sons not paying shall be sued for
the amount. The Directors will
not adopt this method of collecting
unless it becomes necessaary to
liquidate their indebtedness. But
we are satisfied, that, it will not be
necesp/ry, as all the subscribers
can meet their obligations by the
20th of October.
We urge upon every citizen in
the Parish to help this institution
and subscribe to the Stock. The
stock is only five dollars a share,
and we would like to see every far
mer the owner at least of a share.
Great preparation is being made
for the uext annual meeting which
promises now to be a great and de
cided success. Visitors and exhib
itors from other Parishes will be
here, to contend with the people ot
Rapides for the prizes offered.
CP* We h»»i»t tho nanio of the White
People's State Ticket to-day, but nntke no
chaude in onr Parish organization's name,
the Pariah Convention may do that if it
tbialis it äMir&bta.
Office Seeking I
Tho Louisiana Democrat of Wed
nesday last, dived iuto the shallow
depths ot his "inner consciousness,"
and came up dripping from the ef
fort, with what bo thought would
be a smasher at the Caucasian's
corps of Editors; viz: that they
are seeking office. The writer ot
this, our Mr. Hunter, deems this a
proper occasion to say that it is
not true that cither of the Editors
of this paper has sought or is seek
ing office. Neither of them has or
would nsk any man for his support
for any position. Being authorized
to speak for himséltonlv, he desires
further to say here, what he has
openly proclaimed on the Streets
for months, that under no circum
stances, upon no considerations
would he allow his name to be used
for any office, nor would he accept
any office in the gift of the people
of Rapides, it iinnauiinously ten
dered to him. He is in nobody's
way, wants nothing and seeks only
to be allowed to work for the people
among whom he was born aud raised
with the hope and expectation of
no other reward than tho approv
al of his own conscience, and the
benefit that will lie derived by him
professionally, from a prosperous
and thriving condition of affairs in
this parish and State. His motives
are selfish only iu so far as they
seek advancement in Iiis profession
al stauding, aud the number and
amount ot fees that it might be
possible for him to get if the coun
try was prosperous. Who says
else speaks falsely.
The writer would not have
brought his naine forward but for
the charge of the Democrat at this
time, when silence would 1iave per
haps been enterpreted as a conies
sion of its truth.
Tiie Roads .—The roads in many
places need work, and the bridges
throughout the parish, should be
repaired. There is some complaint
aboiif the bridge««, in many places
being dangerous to the traveling
public. Will the Road Syndics see
to it, and do their duty, requiring
every one to do work that the law
requires. The crops will soon be
conveyed to markst, and Vvitli bad
roads, much delay and expense is
incurred. Nothing conveys a bet
ter idea of progress and civilization
iu any country, than well worked
public roads, by which travel is fa
cilitated and journeys made with
ease. It is a criminal offense tor a
Road Syndic to neglect or refuse to
discharge his duty, and no doubt
any delinquent will hear from the
next Grand Jury that meets.
fy Messrs. Buer & Mann of New
Orleans have opened with a new
and complete stock ot goods at A.
Hey m an's old stand, Front St ree'.
VVe are gratified to learn that they
liavs employed Mr. A. Ileyman as
Chief Clerk and they displayed
their wisdom in so doing. Mr. Hey
man is a thorough business man,is
well known to the country here,
and will doubtless attract consider
able trade to the store of Messrs.
Baer & Mann. We aro informed
by parties who have purchased
there, that they a e selling goods,
remarkably cheap, for cash.

9S7» Will the Democrat deny that
it had a copy in full of the proceed
ings of the Mass Meeting of the 8th
inst., and that he gave that copy
to us from which the Caucasian's
report was made? If that don't

Confiscation and Bnin in South Car*
ftHn*.
" The rapid descent to min of Sonth
Carolina is well illustrated by the Ag
ares given by the Charleston New« in
regard to the Innd confiscated in de
limit of the payment of State taxes.
In twenty-two counties there have
been sold or confi«cnted by the 8tate
in two years 580.134 acres of land,
equal in area to !MiO square miles, and
throngliont the entire Stole the sales
and forfeitures reach 848,057 neres, or
1,320 square miles. As the entire area
of land assorted for taxation is but lit
tle over sixteen find s half millions of
acres, it follows that fire per cent, of
the whole area, of ihe Stiito has already
l»een confiscated for the non-payment
of taxes."
The nbovo shows the lamentable
condition of South Carolina, under
the rule of npgroes and carpet-bag
gers. It is true that not so much
property in this State has yet been
confiscated, but if the Tax Collec
tors throughout the State should
proceed by forced sales, to make
collections due for taxes, Louisiana
would suffer as much us South Car
olina has. There is no parish in
the State that can pay the taxes
assessed, and still the negro Legis
lature continues from year to year
to pile on the burdeus, until at last
if Radical rule remains, over one
half of tho land will revert to the
State, and the carpet-baggers, and
capitalist allied with them, will own
our rich possessions, and onr im
poverished people, ruthlessly turn
ed out of their houses, and driven
from their homes, as strangers to
a strange land. But we are satis
fied that with the unanimity of the
white people in this State, that the
infamons government that has so
long oppressed us, wiil be overturn
ed ut the ballot box in November
next, and the people prepared by
force if necessary to take possession
of tho government and offices to
which they are entitled.
Could a people liavo greater in
centive to exertion than the State
of Louisiana ? Every hope of the
future depends upon the white men
of the State rallying around their
standard, and using every means
in their power to successfully com
bat the cursed host of Radicalism,
and beat back their black cohorts
that are defiantly threatening to
trample into the 'lust onr civiliza
tion, and drive the plough share of
ruin over the fair domain of our an
cestors. Not only will the success
of the Radical party place the land
owners in the condition of those oi
Sonth Carolina but complete Affn
conization must follow, with mixed
schools and forced social equality
with a race ot people, that have
neither virtue, honesty or intelli
gence. If we would save the land
we love and our churches, school
house and even our graveyards
from impions desecration, let us
buckle on our armor in good faith,
and present a bold unbroken front,
that will show to the negro and his
degraded ally, white renegade's
that we arc terribly in earnest, and
mean exactly what we say, that
this is a white man's government,
and white men shall rule and con
trol it.
Hon . A. H. Leonard —The
name of this bold and fearless de
fender of the rights of the people
of Louisiana, was put iu nomina
tion in the Congressional Conven
tion and if he had desired the office
he would havebeennomiiiated on the
first ballot. He declined because
he said he was woiking for the peo
ple and did not wish to give an oo
casion to have his motives miseu
terpreted. All honor to the un
selfish patriot !

Pursuant to » call of the Demo«

Hall this day, August 24th, 1874.
At an early hour the* delegates
began to assemble, and by 12
o'clock, the spacious ball was liter*
ly crowded.
In magnificent contrast stands
this body of intelligent and repre
sentative men, cotnpured to the
pack of mongrels who congregated
iu the same hall two yeara ago, to
nominate the present usurper and
his lieutenants.
We venture to say, that a mora

No caucusing or wire pulling, each
delegate seemed to vie with the
other in n determination to have a

usurpation.

The convention took it recess for
an hour to give time for the com

Two sets of delegates presented
