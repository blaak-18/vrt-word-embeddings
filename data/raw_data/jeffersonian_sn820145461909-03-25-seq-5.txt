XV TO THE STATE SANITARIUM
Mr. R. E. Dunnington, who has been
a patient at the State Sanitarium at
Milledgeville for the past eighteen
months, and who was released on
March 12th, stopped off in Thomson
for a few hours last Thursday as he
was going to his home near Augusta,
to give Mr. Watson his statement of
the conditions prevailing at that in
stitution. His story was told in a
ealm, even voice, without any indica
tions whatever of mental unbalance,
and is printed below in his own words:
A Living Hell—The Imps and Their
Victims.
A few days before Christmas, 1907,
I was recovering from a fifty-one days’
fast, having been endeavoring to cure
a violent case of indigestion, and when
I began to eat again after my fast, my
nerves went all to pieces. Through an
incompetent doctor’s advice, I was
sent to the asylum at Milledgeville.
This doctor said that the diet would
be suited to my case; in fact, to each
individual case, and that I would get
the best medical treatment obtaina
ble.
I desire to say that the food fed
there to run-down invalid patients
would not be fed to a decent dog by
his master, if he thought anything of
his dog. Especially do I refer to the
Twin-building, where a cook named
Strowe, brought down from New York
State, messes the food up and gets
$65 per month for so doing. The corn
bread served for dinner looks and
feels like Belgium blocks used for pav
ing purposes; heavy, soggy and unfit
to be fed to hearty, laboring negroes,
and I dare say that there was no such
diet fed by the worst slave-holders
during slavery days. These poor un
fortunate creatures are humans, even
though their minds are affected. The
majority of this stuff can not be eat
en and so is thrown in the slop to
the hogs, and the patients go hungry.
For 'breakfast at the Twin-building,
they get a cold mess of stuff called
hash and grits, unfit to eat, and I
have on several occasions found cock
roaches as large as my finger in this
hash. At supper we had dry bread
and molasses and a little butter about
twice a week and cheese once a week
during the winter season.
The tax payers of Georgia maintain
a large dairy here, having just recent
ly put up a large new building; also
they maintain an orchard and gardens
which are worked by the patients.
But who drinks the milk? Who eats
the choice peaches and melons and po
tatoes, etc.? Why, the “chokers,” —
or in their language,—attendants and
the superintendents, Samuel Simpson
and Ira Hemphill, also former “cho
kers.” Why do you call these attend
ants chokers? I guess is your natural
question. I answer, because this is
the first thing they resort to in hand
ling patients,—hard to handle and not
hard to handle. They often resort to
choking because the patients “sass”
or talk oack to them. There are some
of the most ignorant men serving
there in the capacity of attendants
that I have ever seen. These ignorant
men are hired by the doctors who
know little or nothing of their repu
tation before they, are placed thert>.
They very often come to the ho-pi tai
in overalls, mere tramps, raggej and
unclean, but after they a»< here a
short while they get fat :.ud sassy—
too big for their new ,!
that they buy with money paid to
them out of the pocket of the tax
payer. Their favorite pastime is
teasing the patients. They congregate
on certain halls and play cards, mak
ing the patients wait on them by
bringing them spittoons and then emp
tying them. The patients do the hard,
unclean work, such as scrubbing and
rubbing the floors, scouring, etc., and
they get no pay for it. Not even do
they get their tobacco, which the
State of Georgia furnishes them. It
is chewed up or sold by the attend
ants. There are patients here who are
not allowed tobacco under the pre
tense that they will spit on the floor,
especially do I refer to S hall, whose
head attendant is Morgan Thomson,
and assistant Cleve Haddaway. Cieve
Haddaway is a big blithering idiot,
something on the order of a negro
laborer, and away below the average
one at that. As I have seen many a
negro -wage-earner that will talk with
more sense than this fellow. The head
attendant, Morgan Thomson, is cf the
same calibre.
The Gilmans are the predominating
people, there being nearly a dozen
“chokers” of that name there. Tom
Gilman is yard man at Convalescent
and he hurt my feelings on several
occasions when I was at Convalescent,
but I paid no attention to him. Flem
ing Gilman is a noted choker. I must
also mention Thomas Hollis, head at
tendant of Twenty Ward of Convales
cent, who beats and mistreats his
patients. I have heard him beating
patients locked up at the wire guard
room at different times, especially at
night, until I felt like screaming for
mercy for them. The men were crazy
and were only talking a little in their
delirious fashion, and Thomas Hollis
would go in with a broom-stick and
beat them unmercifully. I have seen
the men’s legs bear black and blue
marks from their hips on down to
the bottom of their feet. This is a
man who has been on Twenty for a
long time. This Hollis is a big, husky
brute, and I have seen him trip pa
tients up and throw them so hard
to the floor until I have often won
dered why no bones were broken.
They were men who were too crazy to
report the matter to the doctor, ana
if they had done so he would have
paid no attention to it whatever. One,
Lingo, a patient of T hall, was tripped
up by a former attendant named Den
nis, formerly of R hall, and his hips
broken. This man lay in agony for
month's and months, and now he has
to walk on crutches. This was done
in fun, so it was said. Mr. Lawson,
from Augusta, now on 0 hall, Twin
building, came there with two good,
legs and has been crippled up by a
former attendant named Cook. One,
Wade Brown, from Savannah, was on
C Ward and this man Cook was an
attendant on that hall. Cook asked
Mr. Brown to empty his spittoon for
him and because Brown refused to do
so, the said Cook hit him on a silver
plate that was in his head, where he
had been shot, knocking the plate in,
and causing the plate to rest on the
brain, and he is in bad shape now.
Doctors Jones and R. C. Swint were
informed of this circumstance but it
did no good whatever. When a man
reports things of this character it is
called “illusions” by the doctors and
jt is not investigated. They only ask
Jeffersonian
the attendants if they have done this
or that, and of course they deny any
such thing. It is, however, too true
and the marks on the patients will
remain with them for life. One man
named Glenn, who was on Q ward
when I left the Sanitarium, had his
legs broken over at the Green Building
and is now being rolled about in an
invalid’s chair. Ira Hemphill, now
supervisor, was head attendant. This
Tom Hollis has a brother named
Henry, who is a very cruel fellow, and
it has been said of him that he has
killed several of the patients. While
I cannot confirm this from having seen
it, I do remember seeing him choke
several patients several times very
badly while on T hall. He choked
one man named Jenkins because he
happened to run against the feet of
another patient while using the mops
cleaning the floor. This patient Jen
kins was a very sick, weak man and
only weighed 115 or 120 pounds,
while Henry Hollis weighs about 280
pounds. Tom Hollis beat up a patient
with a broom-stick in the wire guard
room on the night of March Bth. The
poor fellow begged and begged for
mercy but the brute beat away as if
he was trying to kill a mad dog. The
tax-payers of Georgia owe it to the
poor, unfortunate insane people to
discharge this man Hollis. He has an
assistant named Berry who helps him
to beat up patients. Both of these
men are brutal to the extreme. Frank
Gilman is another very brutal fellow,
as I hear from the patients who have
been on the ward with him.
I will try here and give you my
experience with these “chokers” in
this living hell. I was carried to the
reception hall, C, December 27, 1907.
My troubles commenced there with a
brutish fellow named Ezell, former as
sistant attendant, who harassed me
continually, keeping me locked up on
the most trivial excuse. One thing
is that I asked the night watchman
for a drink of water, and it being
part of the watchman’s specific duties
to give patients water at night, I was
assistant physician, was told of the
justified in so doing. R. C. Swint,
occurrence, but he did not even
censure Ezell, and when they brought
me over to W Ward, I was painted in
black colors to William May, the head
attendant of that ward. I was taken
sick one night and walked the floor
and almost screamed I was suffering
so. Will May came into the room
with a crowd of attendants that night
and tied my hands and feet together
and nearly drowned me in the bath
tub, holding my head under the water
until I had swallowed several pints
of water (if it was possible for my
stomach to hold that much), and I
was badly strangled. I was then
taken down to the wire guard room
until morning, when they came into
the room and beat me some more and
said that if I told the doctor they
would kill me. The assistant doctor,
R. C. Swint, did not even censure
them, but moved me down to O Ward,
with Mr. Jim Ross, a very kind old
gentleman, where I fared better. A
mean patient jumped on me on 0
Ward and because I had to fight I
was moved to T Ward. A former at
tendant named Harris, and Morgan
Thomson and Cleve Haddaway and a
fellow named H. E. Fleury came into
