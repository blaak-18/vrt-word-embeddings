Press of the Country is Responsible
for the Great Growth of the Klan
The press of the country has, more
than any one agency, increased the
membership of the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan to what it is today.
From the press the Klan has received
gratis, and is still receiving daily, ad
vertisement that it worth millions in
cold cash.
Never have the newspapers seeking
to do men or a movement an evil turn
so completely, and to their own as
tonishment, done a good one. Never
in history have shrewd newspaper
writers and editors so materially mis
judged the effect of scientific pub
licity, overshot their mark, and where
they sought to destroy merely build
up and where they tried to anni
hilate, create a firmer foundation.
In the whole history of newspaper
campaigns never was the effect of one
so badly misjudged, by men who
ought to know better, than was the
attack upon the Klan launched by
the New York World and the Hearst
newspapers.
The great presses in a hundred
daily newspaper offices thundered
viciously as they ground out theii
tirades and discharged their verbal
broadsides against the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan. In every city and in
every hamlet of America men, women
and children read of this great fra
ternal order about which under nor
mal circumstances they would have
heard but little and to whose prin
ciples scant consideration or atten
tion. Traitors to the Klan became
penny a liners. Klan copy was hard
to get. When facts gave out then
fiction had to serve. The Klan oath
was published broadcast by the mil
lion copies and carried its patriotic
appeal to the average red blooded
American. Oceans of ink, car loads
of news print, hours of time were
devoted to an excoriation of an order
about which the writers knew little
but which had, thanks to the newspa
pers themselves, become the biggest
story since the war.
The “Making” of News
Now every newspaper man knows
that various newspapers “make” their
own stories. In every newspaper
office are bright and alert young men
looking for anything unusual which
they think may spur the cloyed and
jaded news palate of the public.
A millionaire oil man was killed by
his mistress in a little Oklahoma town.
A sordid enough crime, dirty in its
details, but news was slack just then
and the great Chicago Tribune jump
ed on this and “made” the story.
They hired special trains, employed
expert detectives and turned loose
star reporters to trace the murderess.
Not because they had any wish to
see justice done but merely because
it was “hot stuff” and their own ex
clusive story. Other newspapers fol
lowed suit. They had to, in order to
hold their readers and keep pace with
the strenuous competition. So un
happy little Cluara Hammond for
weeks took up the front pages of
every newspaper in the country mere-

News Items of
Senator James A. Reed, of Missouri
has tossed his hat into the President
ial ring, and he is going after the
Missouri delegates to the Democratic
national convention hammer and
tongs. He made this announcement
after a long conference with 150 of
his followers from the “Show-me”
state at St. Louis. He did not lay
down in his platform whether he is
going to fight the Ku Klux Klan or
not like Senator Underwood, of Ala
bama did, but those who know the
Missouri senator give him credit with
being too shrewd a politician to make
a serious mistake like that in his
opening announcement. Senator Reed
will make things somewhat merry in
the Democratic camp as he is a great
campaigner and a most effective
speaker. He may not get very far in
the race but he will raise lots of dust
while he is at it. And again, that’s
politics.

Masonic order and now faces trial

his resignation had been requested by

ly because the Chicago Tribune had
decreed that her wretched story was
human interest stuff and a good ex
clusive reading.
Similarly the New York World look
ing around for a sensation determined
to squelch the Klan, pin a feather in
its journalistic bonnet and incidental
ly crow over the rest of the newspa
per world, “We did it. We killed a
bear.”
There were two ways open to at
tack the Klan from a newspaper
standpoint, really three of them. The
first was open and vehement attack,
the second ridicule and the third ut
ter disregard.
The first way was the best was to
get subscribers from among Klansmen
and anti-Klansmen alike, because you
know that many a Klansman reads
the anti-Klan sheets just to see what
they are going to say next about their
order and the leaders of it. The sec
ond course, ridicule, would perhaps
have proved the more deadly. The
third course would have been more
harmful still but dignified silence gets
a newspaper nowhere. Newspapers
are not altruistic institutions. The
voracious maw of a sensation
public must be filled with choice thril
lers else the counting house down
stairs will suffer. And the business
office is the solar plevus of the mod
em day sheet, the most vulnerable
spot for a knock out.
The World’s Attack
So the World determined to elim
inate the Klan by the direct action
route. Into the journalistic sewers
they dived. Printed 'stolen letters.
Bribed traitors. Yelled treason to
high heaven. Turned loose a flood
of abuse which in its very volume was
terrifying not alone to Klansmen but
to Protestant Americans as well. In
order to do a good job the World syn
dicated their Klan expose. Sold it
where they could to papers in all parts
of the country. Practically gave the
stuff away when they could not get
their own price.
The yellow hounds of Hearst joined
their yapping to the chorus and from
coast to coast the favorite indoor
pastime for hack writers and special
assignment men was “kussing” the
Klan.
They Overdid It
When the smoke cleared away and
the poison gas had risen sufficiently
for the World and Hearst to judge
the effect of their tremendous broad
side they got the surprise of their
lives. They had overdone the thing.
They had made the Klan appear in
the light of martyr in the eyes of
an American public which in every
battle or contest demands fair play.
Protestant Gentile Americans had
smelt a rat. They wondered what
was back of all this opposition led
by newspaper notoriously controlled
by Jewish and Catholic influences.
They started to investigate and con
cluded when all. was said and done
that the Klan was an American insti

Some Tire of Fight
Just at present the press of the
nation seems to have no fixed plan of
campaign against the Klan. Individ
ual Jews or Catholics owning and con
trolling newspapers of course con
tinue their rancorous attacks more
locally than nationally. Many news
papers, however, have got sick and
tired of beating their wings against
an invisible force and fighting a
phantom foe. Some editors honestly
admit that they were wrong in their
first adverse impression of the Klan.
Down in the Southwest a great
newspaper which printed the World
Klan expose, and later lost half a
dozen elections fighting the Klan, has
gracefully retired from the arena
weakened by the loss of 50,000 sub
scribers which it is attempting to win
back by means of every circulation
getting dodge known to experts in
this line. This newspaper which a
year ago would not knowingly give a
Klansman a job is now eager to get
them believing that their presence on
their pay roll will help counteract
the faux pas of their editors.

in spots evidences an attitude of “lay
ing off” the Klan. Circulation has
been impaired where Klansmen are
numerous and in particular have the
dailies with great circulations in the
rural districts felt the pinch in this
respect. The Klan has, of course,
never boycotted any newspapers what
ever they may have said or, however,
vicious they may have been. It has

EVERY ORGANIZATION
HAS ITS JDOAS
The Church of Christ, the greatest
institution known today and for cen
turies past, has been divided in be
liefs, had its scoffers, been betrayed
and suffered from attacks from with
in end without. Yet we believe in it.
We recall that Jesus chose 12 dis
ciples to follow Him. One of this
small number was a Judas, who be
trayed Him for a few pieces of silver.
Another one a doubter; still another
at one time denied Him. Yet His
Word is still gospel to us.
Was there ever an organization
that did not have its Judas, its doubt
ers, its enemies?
Is it to be expected or hoped that
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,
reorganized here in the Twentieth
Century, a time when men are money
mad, and had the growth, the almost
phenomenal growth, into millions of
members in the short time of seven
years, does not have its Judas who
will sell it out (or attempt to) for
a few pieces of silver? Do we ex
pect its officers to be perfect, its
membership all loyal, and reading the
daily papers, too, is it more to expect
than of the Church itself?
Klansmen, we suggest to you: Rea
son with yourselves as above. Note,
of all those who have been charged
as Klansmen with breaking the law
of the land, how few, if any, have
been found guilty. A man may be
a member of many other orders—the
church, or what not — and if it hap
pens to be believed he is a Klansman,
and has transgressed the law in the
lightest, he is heralded far and near
as a “hooded law-breaker,” saying
nothing of any other order to which
he might belong. This fact that he is
a Klansman is warranty for a double
header write-up.
Now, from the Church down, every
organization has the right to fix a
standard for membership, and to
choose its members according to its
own manner, except the Klan, which
has not the right to say who shall
be accepted or who not, or the right
to keep their membership a secret
known only to Klansmen.

THE SCHOOL BOARD
Syracuse, N. Y.—A state-wide cam
paign to ban short-sleeved, low-neck
ed gowns, sheer silk stockings, freak
hair styles and the powder puff and
lip stick in the high schools has swung
under way here with Dr. Merton P.
Corwin, principal of Jamestown high
school, as its leader.
Dr. Corwin, who outlined his cam
paign before the conclave of the As
sociated Academic Pincipals of New
York State, wants school authorities
to have the right to bar girl students
who are guilty of conspicuous dress
and attire.
The modern method of dress in the
high school is one of the gravest prob
lems of the high school principal to
day, he maintains. The problem, he
said, did not originate in the school,
rather it was forced upon the school
by conditions put before the girls by
the motion pictures and the socalled
younger social set of the present gen
eration.
“Like High Life ”
In most communities, Corwin point
ed, out there is a strictly modern
younger set which glories in what it
terms “high life.” Girls of high
school age, only a little younger than
many of the girls in that set, look
up to their mode of living and dress
and set out to mimic it as closely as
possible he said. Each, trying to out
do the other, brings the style of
dress beyond the bounds of common
sense and close to the point of in-
decency.
Among things Corwin wants kept
out of school are silk stockings. How
ever, he explains, that doesnt mean
that the texture of the hose must un
dergo an examination to determine
whether it is silk, cotton or wool. The
word silk, he says, is used to desig
nate the too sheer hose—the bright
colored hose worn, as he says, to at
tract attention.
Service Is Test
The test, he says, of the proper
dress to be worn by the schoolgirl
is whether it is worn for service or
appearance only. None can possibly
claim, he says, that the flimsy excuse
for sleeves, the sheer stockings and
the low strapped sandals are purchas
ed for serviceable qualities.
He insists that school authorities
have the right to demand that the
girl who comes to school rouged or
with face unnaturally made up should
be asked to wash her face, just as the
boy coming with face covered with
mud would be requested to wash his.
Garb Too Costly.
Too expensive clothes, he believes
should be barred from the school as
well as too little clothes. He believes
girls and boys in high school have a
right to attend classes on an equal
basis with all the other pupils and
not be divided into classes by the
style of clothes their parents can af
ford to buy them.
If the high school authorities in
each community would insist on the
common sense standard of service
ability, he says, the girls would soon
work out the problem of attractive
clothes that still conformed to the
standards of decency.
Stripped of theorizing, the Nordic
proposition amounts to this America

speaking, a great success of it. Scold
as you please, there are now here

happiness than in any other large
country in the world. It is now de

Central Europeans, Mediterraneans,
Levantines and sheer Asiatics; in
other words to keep a population
made up now of blends of similar and
congenial elements from being altered
into a heterogeneous collection of
races which in the Old World have
never assimilated, but have always
fought. Can these elements possibly
be tossed together in a blanket here
into a successful nation ?
Does the Nordic argument imply
any offensive assumption of race su
periority ? Does it help the discus
sion to say that long ago Eastern
peoples developed their art and re
ligion more than did those of the
West? The pertinent fact is that
now we are not getting any gains
in art or religion from the Eastern
lands, and have not for centuries.
What use again, to extol the sterling
character of the Lombard folk of
North Italy?. It is the Neapolitans

collars and cuss-words, have learned
all their social and political lessons

Consternation has seized those who
are fighting to keep American gates
open to the flood of immigrants and
with the leading publications of the
country taking up the fight on unre
stricted immigration and which was
started by the Ku Klux Klan, there i 3
much hurrying and scurrying among
the pro-alien interests.
In the World’s Work for January in
an article entitled the “Immigration
Peril,” it is pointed out that it takes
only a sixty months’ residence in this
country for “an Anatolian shepherd
or a Russian mujik to be entitled to
sit in judgment as a ‘peer’ in an Amer
ican court.”
Magazines and newspapers are each
day bringing forth new and vital rea
sons why the gates of the United
States should be closed against the
great influx of foreigners who do not
only bring themselves to America
but bring their theories along with
them. The pro-alien interests are
now realizing more than ever that the
battle started by the Ku Klux Klan to
keep America clear of European ideals
and practices, is one that cannot be
stopped.
Thousands of Alien Lawyers
In citing the fact that out of more
than eleven thousand lawyers in New
York City, more than 50 per cent are
of foreign birth, or foreign parent
age, the writer in the Worlds Work
says:
“Not so long ago, Elihu Root,
speaking before the American Bar
Association, dwelt on the many and
complex questions, such as the ef
fects of taxation, the social struc
ture, justice to the poor and injustice
to the poor and injustice to the rich.
He hoped that these and divers other
important questions would be solv
ed by the application to the now
conditions of the old principles of jus
tice out of which grew our institu
tions.’ But to do this, he observed, we
must have men who undestand those
principles, their history, their reason,
their spirit, their capacity for exten
sion, and their right application.' In
other words, we must have a Bench
and Bar of the highest intellectual
and moral integrity, deeply versed—
stepped one might say—in the learn
ing and the spirit of our laws and of
our jurisprudence. Yet, as he point
ed out, a very large part of our new
accessions to our legal profession,
particularly in the large cities, are of
young men who have come from the
countries of eastern Europe, from
countries where there was a highly
developed jurisprudence, and having
necessarily, by inheritance, all those
predilections and fundamental ideas
which differentiate the Continental
systems of jurisprudence from the
The Nordic Proposition
Anglo-American system. These young
men come here—and they are coming
to our bar by the tens of thousands
—with continental ideas born in them.
No cramming for an examination will
get them out. They are not to be
learned or dislearned out of a book.
Those ideas can be modified or adopt
ed to our ideas aonly by contact with
life—contact with American life—
taking, in the processes of life, some
conception of what the American
thought and feeling and underlying
basis of honesty and pustice are.
Proud of Polish Judge
“Contrast this with the editorial
statement, in a Polish paper publish
ed in New Jersey, translated as fol
lows: ‘We pride ourselves on having
a Polish judge here, and a Polish clerk
there,’ followed by an appeal for the
Polish voters to ‘stand together* if
they want more offices. Contrast the
warning spoken before the highest
national assembly of American lawy
ers with the situation in some of our
largest cities and states where many
of the magistrates in our lower
courts and not a few of the judges
in our higher tribunals are either for
eign born or of foreign extraction.
Contrast it with the fact that in the
richest and busiest metropolis of the
United States of some eleven thou
sand lawyers, more than 50 per cent
are of foreign birth or of foreign par
entage.
“No less a careful and judicial body
than the Committee on Legal Educa
tion of the Association of the Bar of
the city of New York, under the chair
manship of the dean of the Columbia
Law School, has gone on record with
this finding which I have emphasized
to the far with little knowledge of
American institutions and with little
or no appreciation of those ideals and
traditions which have in the past
dominated the spirit of our Anglo-
American legal system. The result is
that the bar is carrying an almost in
supportable burden of a large mem
bership unfitted by education or ex
perience to bear its responsibilities
and without the inclination which
comes naturally from familiarity with
our institutions, to maintain its tradi
tions.
“But what shall we say of that other
burden of alienage upon our legal
system—the burden of mental and
moral alienage upon the system of
trial by jury? Let us bear n mind that

constitution of every state in the

wall around this Country and stunt
its civilization? Not unless we pro
hi?*'t foreign mails, the use of the
printing press, the visits of bona-fide
travelers and traders, and the free
exchanges of men of learning and
science.
Again, does history teach anything
about the admixture of unlike human
elements? Emphatically it does, and
tells that while the blending of de
cidedly similar peoples frequently
produces excellent results, as with the
old Celts and Germans in Northern
France, when genuinely alien races
are jumbled together the conse
quences are not civilization but chaos.
Freely may it be declared that in no
land has this admixture taken place
and a collapse or eclipse of culture
failed speedily to follow. The Greeks
of history may have come, after a
long interval, from a mingling of a
Northern race with an Aegean, but
we know that the first fruits of their
contact were centuries of renewed
barbarism after the downfall of the
myterious civilization of Crete.
It is no assumption of superiority
to recognize the manifest biological
laws which keep great civilizations
strong. A certain race endowed with
extraordinary genius has, of course,
kept its blood pure across the ages.
Would that race have retained its
genius, if its sons had freely married
outside their own people? Very pos
sibly Japan and China represent
many things America might well
imitate, but who proposes to get those
things by permitting a general influx
of coolie labor? For better or worse
‘Nordics” fit into our ways, accept our
institutions, and mingle with our peo

Bureau of Publication and Education.
Washington, D. C., Jan. 24.—The
Ku Klux Klan is receiving publicity
nowadays that is helpful, constructive
and educational. The country is
opening its eyes to the fact that
often the Klan gets in and helps the
police clean things up, even though
the fellow' who gets cleaned might
hoppen ~to be a member of the In

ference if the fellow be an erring
member, he needs it and he gets it.
How the Ku Klux Klan sided in
the arrest of one of its members in
the National Capital who was in bad
has became known here when details
surrounding the apprehension of
Prescott Edward Haskell, former
policeman of Washington, on a charge
of bigamy, were made public.
It is charged that Haskell married
Miss Bertha Miller, of Massachusetts,
in Baltimore nearly three years ago,
residing in Seat Pleasant, Md., with
her until some months ago, when he
sent her to a former home in Penn
sylvania. On December 15, when he
resigned from the police force, Has
kell is said to have married Miss
Margaret Dooley, keeping her in
ignorance of the former marriage.
Recently both wives became aware of
the facts, it is alleged, but Haskell
returned to Massachusetts before any
action could be taken.
He is now in jail on a charge of
bigamy. Score one more for the

Country which do not permit any
men to have more than one wife at a

problem enough when *he ‘law of the
land’ is becoming subject more and
more to ‘interpretations’ by lawyers
and judges culturally alien to our
juridic life and traditions; but a subt
ler danger is developing through the
cultural alienage of vast masses of
foreign born or foreign minded ‘peers’
who today sit in judgment in the jury
boxes of American courts. It takes
only sixty months’ residence in this
country (and that residence may be
in the non-American environment of
a foreign “colony” in our midst) and
the most smiple of tests in the veneex
of ‘Americanization’ to make an Ana
tolian shepherd or a Russian mujik
entitled to sit in judgement as a
‘peer* in an American court. It is
enough to state it to show not mere
ly the absurdity but the grave danger
of such a free and easy system. And
those well-intentioned, but thought
less Americans, who are so anxious
to ‘naturalize’ the newcomers as
quickly and in as great numbers as
passible, ought to bear in mind that
such crude and surface ‘citizenship’
has its repercussions not only on our
political institutions but on that great
legal system which, through the cen
