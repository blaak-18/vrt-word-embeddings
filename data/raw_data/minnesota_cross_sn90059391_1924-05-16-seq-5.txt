CONDEMN BAD FILMS
(Continued from page 1)
heroes, the time has come to call a
halt in the increasing portrayal of
brutality, crime, and immorality, del
egates said.
“Nine-tenths of the acts our chil
dren see portrayed in the movies
would bring them a jail sentence
were they to do the same thing on
the street, and then we mothers
would be the ones condemned," Mrs.
Merriam continued.
“The argument of the producers,
Mrs. Merriam asserted, “that, unless
they film this kind of pictures, they
will have to go out of business, that
the good picture does not pay in the
box office, is disputed by their own
figures.
“Figures issued from Hollywood
last summer show that the films that
paid the best in July were the most
wholesome pictures ever made, and
of the ten which were the worst fail
ures from the box-office standpoint,
none deserved patronage.
Standards Held Defied
“In our schools and churches and
homes we are helping the child to
choose the best ir» life and to avoid
the pitfalls. And then we allow the
motion picture industry to defv all
the standards and ideals on which the
nation is founded. Most of the mov
ie themes today show no respect for
law or government. Marriage is
treated lightly and the conventions
are often disregarded,” she said.
Organization of mothers’ clubs in
connection with the' Sunday schools
throughout the country was one of
the important pieces of the conven
tion business.
The Laying on of Hands
(From The St. Paul Dispatch)
Addressing the twenty-eighth an
nual convention of the Mothers’ and
Parent-Teachers’ association, in ses
sion in St. Paul, Miss Alma L. Bin
zel, educational director for the fed
eration of chjld study, declared that
the old-fashioned hickory stick or
the more modern razor strop are not
always’*the best or most effective
means of making children obey. Per
haps she is right, even though there
be Scriptural authority from the
world’s wisest man, that sparing the
rod spoils the child. Judging from
the lack of obedience in too many

homes, the question raised by Miss
Binzel is not one lightly to be put
aside. The child who learns obedi
ence by whatever method of punish
ment, corporal or mental, has learned
the first lesson in good citizenship.
He goes oul into the world having
learned to obey and readily adapts
himself to the larger law of the land
and the restraint of it does not irk
him, because he has become used to
it.
But in measuring the punishment
to be dealt out to the child, this
should be remembered: that the law
of the land is not gentle toward de
linquents. It lays on with a heavy
hand, whether it be jail or scaffold.
At almost the same moment that
Miss, Binzel was doubting the effi
cacy of stick and stcan as means of
punishment, Anton J. Cermak, presi
dent of the county board, Chicago,
after making an invetigation of the
juvenile detention home, was asking
for the organization of a “parents’
whipping club,” as a means of bring
ing incorrigible and untrained youth
back to some knowledge of the mean
ing of obedience. He showed that
the home, costing $1,000,000, had been
damaged by the youngsters in it to
the extent of SIO,OOO in less than six
months. They broke windows, de
stroyed furniture and wrecked the
place. They had never learned the
meaning of wise restraint, or that
obedience w a duty rather than a
hateful servitude.
It may seem harsh to apply the rod.
Parents, unwilling to assume the
burden and vigilance of parenthood,
often advance that as a reason for
their own delinquency toward the
child’s training. But it were far bet
ter that the chlid go under the rod
than to have him suffer the severer
penalties, in adolescence, dealt to
him by the iron hand of the law. In
past generations, when perhaps the
“taws” and the cane played too large
a part, there yet rose a generation
that knew respect and followed after
it.
There is, and there ought to be, a
golden mean between the two ex
tremes. If a sore body will later on
save a sore heart —let it be so. To
avoid a willful, stiffnecked and rebel
lious generation, the laying on of
hands is not without its good points.
JUDGE QUIT KLAN
TO BECOME CITIZEN
(Continued from page 1)
son to get out of the lodge and go on
the witness stand and divulge every
thing that took place in the lodge
room.
Mr. Henry’s Testimony
Robert L. Henry, of Houston, for
merly of Waco, at one time mayor of
Texarkana, an assistant attorney gen
eral, then a representative in con
gress for 20 years, told of his mem
bership in the Klan and his entry in
to the senatorial race at the pri
maries. He told of numerous confer
ences with Senator Mayfield in which
efforts were made to get him out of
the race in favor of Mayfield. Al
though permitted to admit openly his
affiliation, Henry testified that in the
end he found his role to be that of a
“stalking horse,” while Mayfield, the
alleged carrier of Klan endorsement,
came out of the contest with the
winning vote.
Mr. Henry told the committee of
things he alleged happened in con
ference in the home of Dr. Evans,
the present Imperial Wizard of the
Klan, of how Dr. Evans and others
tried repeatedly to get him to retire
from the race in order for Mayfield
to be nominated, saying that there
were three real Klansmen in the race
for the nomination and only one
could win. Sterling P. Strong was
the third Klan candidate for the sen
ate and these conferences were called
for the purpose of trying to elimi
nate Henry and Strong and get the
solid support of the Klan for May
field. He testified that Mayfield had
told him in conference of the heavy
expenditures which were “bleeding
him financially,” and which could on
ly be “recouped" by an election to
the senate.
Mr. Henry said he refused to with
draw, and he says judgment then was
passed upon him for going so far as
to say that Dr. Evans declared that
he would *eturn to Atlanta with the
intention of sending out “sealed or
ders from the Imperial Palace” that
would leave Mayfield the sole Klan
support.
Quotes Mayfield
Mr. Mayfield said he had worked
hard to organize the Klan and get
ready for the election, Mr. Henry
testified. “We talked a long time in
these various conferences and came
to no agreement. I thought I had
some rights and refused to retire.”
“Did Mayfield indicate any amount
of money he spent?” Chairman Spen
cer asked.
“He said he had exhausted him
self," Henry replied. “He said that
he would be broke unless he could get
eletced and recoup.”
At a second conference, Mayfield
renewed the approach and told of his
having been in the Klan longer than
any other candidates and of having
“heavy expenses.” Quoting Dr. Ev
ans, Mr. Henry said: “If I’d known
vou were coming into the Klan, I’d
have kept you out, because you are
ruining our entire plan.”
“I was really out of the contest
but didn’t know it then,” said Mr.
Henry.
Judge ('lark Knocks
Judge Clark, of Houston, a dis
trict judge formerly in Texas, now a
law partner of Mr. Henry, testified
that he joined the Klan in October,
T 921, and resigned on December 9,
1922. During his membership he
said he on the local executive coun
cil, presided as chaplain, then Great
Titan of five provinces in Texas,
and later general counsel for the
Klan for the realm of Texas. He
told about his various appointments
to positions of influence and power
in the Klan. After his resignation
he styled himself a citizen of the
United States. He explained to the
committee that he did not think be
ing a member of the Klan was com
patible with good citienship. He
failed to tell the committee about
seeking to be made general counsel
for the entire organization and de
manding a salary of $25,000 a year
and all of his expenses. He did not
get that appointment and that fail
ure helped him to resign and become
what he called a good American citi
zen.
No Regard for Oath
•“I do not consider that the oath I
took as a Klanspian binds me to with
hold any information that might be
beneficial to this country,” said Judge
Clark. He then introduced a copy of
an agreement among Klan Titans in
January, 1922, at Dallas, apportioning
the order’s funds. He also intro
duced minutes of a Klan meeting and
had them read ixito the Record, told
all sorts of Klan business.
In March, 1922, another conference
was called by Dr. Evans and Mayfield
and the titans were on hand, Clark
said. “Mayfield is the man,” Clark
quoted Evans as saying, “and at the
proper time we will concentrate on
him.” Clark said he became indig
nant, and told Evans he intended to
stand by Henry.
Pulled His Gun
“The conference got so warm,”
Clark said, “that I took my gun out
of my pocket and laid it on the dress
er.” Senator Watson almost broke up
the hearing by asking the witness if
he had a gun with him now.
“No sir, I just wanted to show I
was trying to avoid trouble.”
Revealed Klan Connection
Clark testified he had assisted in
getting Henry permission from the
“Imperial Palace” at Atlanta to un
cover himself as a Klansman. In
May. 1922. he went to Atlanta, he said,
to discuss with Evans the senatorial
campaign in Texas. Mayfield, Clark
continued, helped organize the Tex
as provinces and attended meetings
during 1921. E. Y. Clarke, of Atlan
ta, a former imperial officer, was on
hand.
Many of the things to which Clark
testified were secret information with
him in the position he attained at at
torney for his client, the Klan of
Texas. To divulge this information
was most unethical, as all attorneys
agree. The fact that he did uncover
this made the members of the com
mittee sit up and stare at the wit
ness, as most of the members of the
committee are lawyers.
Oil Man Testifies
John G. Towns, of Houston, con
nected with the legal department of
the Humble Oil company testified
that he contributed personally S6OO
to the campaign and that he and J.
L. Hunter got SI,OOO out of R. S.
Sterling and two other donations of
SSOO each, making $2500 from com
pany officials and employees but that
all gifts were purely personal and not
given as corporate contributions. He
also told or knowledge of one S6O
donation and one or two others of
SIOO each.
On cross examination the witness
stated that Mr. Mayfield did not have
any knowledge of these donations.
This testimony was the only thing
offered during the entire day that
had anything to do with the expendi
ture of money. The committee
warned the Peddy attorneys that un
less they connected the Klan testi
mony up with the '•onspiracy charge
and the expenditure of money that
it would fall flat and had no real val
ue and v/ould be considered irrele
vant an worthless.

SENATE APPROVES
DEMOCRATIC BILL
Washington. A combination of
Democrats and Progressive Republic
ans slaughtered the Mellon tax rates
la the senate and put through the nor
mal and surtax rates on incomes pro
posed by the Democrats.
The Mellon tax reduction program.
In the form proposed by the secretary
of the treasury and advocated by Pres
ident Coolldge, Is now definitely dead.
In Its place congress will pass a tax
reduction bill carrying lower taxes on
small Incomes than Mr. Mellon pro
posed. It is not doubted that Presi
dent Coolldge will sign the bill.
The Simmons or Democratic sur
taxes with a maximum of 40 per cent
were adopted by a vote of 43 to 40.
The normal tax rates of 2, 4 and 0
per cent won by a vote of 44 to 37.
The Simmons bill contains a provi
sion for a 25 per cent flat reduction la
1923 taxes, payable In 1924. So did
the Longworth compromise bill, which
passed the house. The retention of
this 25 per cent flat cut, applicable to
taxes being paid this year, Is assured
whether the Simmons plan Is adopted
In conference as It stands or whether
It aad the Longworth measure are
amalgamated with modifications as be
tween the two.

POLITICIAN RAISED
MONEY FOR VOTE
(Continued from page 1)
“kickin’ through,” and witness told
him not very well, yet he talked
about big sums of money, but on
cross examination admitted that he
had not raised any and had not seen
anv and only handled the |2OO con
tribution. He said that Senator May
field had threatened at Archer City
that if he were not elected to the
Senate that he would continue on the
Texas railroad commission for an
other four years more and that he
would make it hard for the fellows
who refused to "kick in”for his cam
paign. Witness on the other hand
admitted that he never went to a sin
gle man on the list that had been
given him to see nor solicited any
of them.
Notwithstanding his conflicting
testimony the witness said that Sen
ator Mayfield had told him at Aus
tin that he had already spent be
tween $7,500 and SIO,OOO in Harris
county alone, and several thousand
dollars in another county. Yet there
was no evidence to show where any
of this money was ever raised or
where it came from or that any such
amounts were ever expended.
McNamara admitted that Ht had
gone to Corsicana, Texas, to testify
under oath and that he had never dis
closed any such testimony there be
cause no one asked him such ques
tions. This is the first time he has
talked about $30,000, or $5,000 or any
other large sums. And yet he told
the committee here that Mayfield had
asked him to swear to a lie, viz., to
say that he had never sent the S2OO
to Mayfield and that he refused to
do that. He said that was the rea
son he and Mayfield broke their
friendship, but tried to dodge on
cross examination that he and May
field fell out because the latter would
not get him appointed to the Rail
road commission when Mayfield was
elected to the senate.
At the beginning of the hearing,
Attorney Zumbrunn for Senator May
field told the committee that he
would submit a brief next week
showing that Mr. Peddy has accepted
an appointment as .a special assist
ant attorney general, which appoint
ment and acceptance disqualified him
from contending for the seat of Sen
ator Mayfield as he could not hold
two federal offices at one and the
same time. The committee will pass
on this later after the brief has been
filed.
Senators King, of Utah, and Neeley,
of West Virginia, went on record in
committee meeting as being opposed
to the government paying fees, mile
ag and expenses to any witiness un
less the testimony given was found
to be relevant to the case. This will
be done to shut off either side from
bringing witnesses here from far
away Texas at government expense
for a nice trip to Washington.
Members ol the senate sub-com
mittee sitting in the case are Sena
tors Spencer, of Missouri; Watson, of
Indiana; Neeley, of West Virginia;
King, of Utah; and Ernst, of Ken

KNUTSON CHARGES
(Continued from page 1)
ing voluntarily and that Knutson
would always find a welcome in his
home.
When the verdict of the jury was
announced, Representative Knutson
shook hands with Judge Brent. The
trial judge told Mr. Knutson justice
had been done him, and asked him
“please not to judge Virginia by a
few individuals.”
On returning to Washington, Rep
resentatives Newton and Larson of
Minnesota, who helped defend Knut
son. made the following joint state
ment:
Made Investigation
“The days following the arrest
we made a thorough investiga
tion into the facts. We were
convinced of Mr. Knutson’s in
nocence and that the arrest was
made on mere suspicion ,and that
it could have happened to any
one else under similar circum
stances. The verdict, which was
rendered promptly, was strictly
in accord with the evidence, and
was what we had anticipated
from the start.”
In his own behalf Mr. Knutson
said: “I knew that when a fairmind
ed jury would get all the facts that
I would be completely and promptly
vindicated. The. awful ordeal through
which I have passed, no man can
even imagine. I would not wish my
most bitter enemy such mortifica
tion.
“My friends and colleagues never
lost confidence in my innocence.
Their loyalty I can never repay. I
am especially grateful to my col
leagues from Minnesota, who stood
so firmly by me.
“I want to thank my constituents
for their manifestation of confidence
in my innocence. They who know me
best could not, and would not, be
lieve me guilty of the crime charged.”
