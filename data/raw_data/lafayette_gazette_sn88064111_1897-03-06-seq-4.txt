Messrs. Henry Bourdier, J. H.
Carlin, boss carpenters, and R. ti
Duhon of the Creole Saloon, Rayne, n
paid Orton, their old time friend, a ,
visit last Sunday.
Messrs. R. R. Fleming, the
efficient ticket agent, and J. Perro
din, all-round sport, of Rayne,
were among us last Saturday.
The elements on Tuesday, March
2, had a very chilly and foggy ap
pearance, ,but when old Sol made c
his appearance, the fog had to take
a back seat, and the gay little
maskers meandered around the
streets of the little village and made o
life happy. It appeared to one's
mind that he was living in fairy -
land, a land blessed with nothing
but beautiful roses. Simply be
cause the little girls were all attired 1
in Mardi Gras costumes and could
only be detected by their sweet, up
to-date walk. About x1 o'clock
the town was a perfect model of
"ennui." Every one had departed
for the capital city of Lafayette to t
participate in the procession and z
get a glimpse of that magnificent a
and beautiful float of Scott, repre- e
senting the prosperity of the last z6 h
years. A. O. Budroe, H. Blan
chard, J. Guidry, S. Begnaud and ti
Sid Perrodin alone were left to tell S'
the tale of that dreadful disaster,
"lonesomeness," and they made
the elements wild with their bur
lesque procession. First in rank
was A. O. Budroe, the King, rolling ,
the wheel-barrow of prosperity, with
an American keg of beer, next H.
Blanchard, his royal highness the
Duke of Dixie Pale, followed by
Sid Pellerin, the "Count of Mix
ology," last came S. Begnaud, the c
Prince of the American Draught S
Beer, floating the palace of ice.
The procession was guarded by J. h
Guidry, the Prince of Kildare, t1
Royal Duke of Low Prices. The F
Royal Band was absent and we
were compelled to engage the Cele- I
brated Chin Band, of La Prairie d
Perdue. That is one reason the
band was lost. At night the King
held full sway at the opera-house, j
owned and managed by P. A. Del- f
homme, and the masked guests were
all entertained royally. The wee
small hours found the gay folks
r that were left---enjoying themselves a
splendidly; then lent set in and all a
was quiet. d
Last season Scott shipped nearly
3,ooo bales of cotton, and '97 will 0
far surpass last year.
The people are progressive and
are determined next season to tae
the lead in all products. Strangers
need'have no fear, as we have one
of the best schools in the State,
with Prof. Simmons, a most effi
cient teacher. So, stranger, come
to Scott, -and the folks will no
doubt let go, and assist in placing
this place on an equal footing with
others.
A terrible disaster took place be
fore the Scott procession was over.
The special train bearing his Royal
Highness, King Attakapas, passed
this place at 1:30 p. m., and the
t eagerness to get a sight of his
majesty, broke the carnival in Scott
to atoms. ORTON.
