OUR POST-CARD CLUB
. By DADDY JIM
One of the letters in this week’s
Post-Card Club contains a number
of mistakes in spelling, punctuation
and composition, and in some other
things which it will take close read
ing and observation to discover.
To the boy or girl, under fifteen,
who will correct the largest number
of mistakes in this letter, we will
give a knife, ring or pin, as first
prize; and we will give second and
third prizes to the next best lists of
corrections.
What we want you to do is this:
Write the letter over again as it
ought to be written, correcting ev
erything which you think is wrong.
The corrections in spelling and punc
tuation will speak for themselves;
but, if you correct the composition,
or anything else, besides the spelling
and punctuation, you must explain
in another letter why you have done
so, telling Daddy Jim exactly what
was wrong in the original letter.
You can get as much fun out of
this as out of a picture puzzle, if you
try; and at the same, time you will be
learning how.to write a letter cor
rectly. When you get through vzith
it, you will know many things that
you did not know before.
TRY TO WIN THIS PRIZE.
Dear Daddy Jim; —Here I am the
third time advancing for admittance
to your page. I’ve written twice be
fore this, but I’ve not seen it pub
lished, so I thought I would write
again. Not the least discouraged;
perhaps it didn’t reach you. My father
is a reader of most publications by
Mr. Watson that he is able to get. He
takes the weekly paper and the
magazine too; he has the “Life and
Speeches”, and is sending for a half
dozen of the books entitled “Beth
any”. lam fourteen years old; have
brown eyes, dark hair, and dark com
plexion. I have been going to school;
am in the eighth grade. If nothing
be daunting in my way, I expect to
be a school-teacher. I’ve never won
a prize awarded by Daddy Jim yet.
I’ve won a great many in the schools.
I am an admirer of education. Never
was it needed more than it is now.
How many of the boys and girls,
readers of the Post-Card Club, would
like for Mr. Watson to be our next
President? I, for one. I think if he
is ever made President he will make
things better; poor children will
have the same opportunities as the
rich children. By that means the
country will make much progress.
I’ve never seen Mr. Watson, but I
have his photograph. I would like
to see more letters from this small
village going to the Post-Card Club.
One reason is that I’m afraid this is
nearing the waste basket. I will
ring off, wishing much success to
Daddy Jim and the members of the
Post-Card Club. —Alpha Ellerbee,
Crest, Ga.
(Your letter, addressed to the “Ju
nior Jeffs”, was published in the Oc
tober number of Watson’s Magazine.
We did not receive it until just after
the department was made up for the
September number; and it was, there
fore, nearly two months late in pub
lication. Will always be glad to
hear from you.)

ONE MORE PICTURE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l have drawn
your picture as I thought you looked,
hoping to win a prize. I am a boy
thirteen years of age. My papa and
mamma read the Jeffersonian paper.
I read the good paper, too. We all
think that the Hon. Thomas E. Wat
son is educating more people than
any other man in.the world.—Your
friend, Miles McKay, R. F. D. 1,
Lyons, Ga.
(Sorry you were too late for the
prize. Although your picture is not
a bit like Daddy Jim, it was care
fully and nicely drawn.)
A LITTLE FLORIDA GIRL.
Dear Dady Jim:—l am a little
girl, and live at Athens, a pretty
town in South Georgia. I have two
sisters and three brothers, five of us
in all. We live on a farm, and have
a nice house and gardon. All the
people living near us takes the Jef
ersonian, and they 'like it fine. In
my judgement, it is the best paper I
have ever saw. I am twelve years old
next week. I was sick this summer,
but am feeling good now. I will be
glad to win one of the prize you
offer, and will hope to hear from
you through the paper.—Your little
freind, Mary Stanley, Athens, Ala.
WANTS TO GO TO WORK.
I am an Athens girl, twelve years
of age. z My papa takes the Jef
fersonian. We all enjoy reading
it. Well, Daddy Jim, there has
just been an old soldiers’ reunion
here, and the old soldiers sure did
have a good time, and of course we
enjoyed it. The school children
marched with them. There were
about 1,700 of them and the school
children together. We girls were
dressed in white, and had red rib
bon in our hair, and red sashes. We
all had flags, and the boys had on
white waists and red ties and flags,
so the march was very pretty. I go
to school and like it fine. I have
eight studies. Send me an outfit,
and I will get some subscribers to
the Jeffersonian. I will ring off for
this time. If this is printed, I will
come again.—Winnie Wallace, Ath
ens, Ga.
NOTICE!
We have no more back numbers
of Watson’s Magazine or the Jeffer

been so great that we have sold out

current number of the magazine
(October) is the only one that we
can supply.
Mr. Watson’s articles on Foreign
Missions will be issued, in the next
few days, in book form, nicely bound
and fully illustrated. This will be a
complete reprint of all the articles in
the April, June, July, August and
September magazines, with some new
matter and comments by Mr. Watson.
Price, twenty-five cents.
We have a few copies of the bound
volumes of Watson’s Magazine for
1907. These numbers are becoming
scarce and valuable. Price, one dol
lar per volume.
