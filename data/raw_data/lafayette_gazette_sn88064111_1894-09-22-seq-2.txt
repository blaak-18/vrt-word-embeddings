negro rule why do the bolters" ex

Democratic party in State and lo

the Republican party does not mean
the ascendency of the black man
why don't those who believe in the

No, tne sugar planters are too in

They know, if not, they will soon
know that they are in error. They
have switched off in the wrong di

in an alliance with the Demas ele

notwithstanding the opinion of Mr. then

seen that the kangaroo family is a and
very prominent one in the United ach
States. It will now be in order for the
the people frqm the various districts thes
to get their congressmen from the wha
sugar bolters and quit sending glad
kangaroos to Congress. It is in- Wm
deed deplorable that the Democrats
of all the Southern and some North

not know it now if Mr. Parkerson

ABOUT RICE.
The following is an epitome of
Dan Talmage's Sons bulletin No. 5 rea
Rice crop i894, dated New York, Pthe
Sept. i5: Crop along the Atlantic
Coast (States of North and South
Carolina and Georgia) well ad
vanced and full of promise. Har- ml
vesting fairly started and grain at fat
thresher shows good outturn in f=
quantity and quality. Total out
come estimated at x,soo, ooo bushels.
As regards Louisiana, which is the
largest and most important Rice
growing State, they say: "While
there are reports of untbward ex
' periences by individual planters,
taken as a rule early plantings are p
in good form and white to the har
vest. Fields are generally clean
a and freer from red..Rice than ever
before. Late plantings are'.ma 4kng
' rapid strideis, but outcome is prob- tic
a lematical as it has not headed and
will not mature until October, h,
therefore menaced by possible o
North winds which may check or a
kill. Labor and machinery abun
e dant and the grain can teasily be Si
> cared for as fast as ready. Heavy
rains early this week compelled sus- fr
pension of harvesting; damaged
.n early crops in some sections, stalks to
Le broken or whipped nearly clean of
n grain. Injury however as comnpared ~
'1 wi-h whole crop was slight, and full
1. compensation derived in benefits
to late Rice. Estimates regarding
the outcome cannot he safely en
' larged from those given last month. ,.
En Every condition at the moment is
favorable, and the acreage planted E
- under favoring auspices should be tU
es good for a yield of x,5oo,00o sacks, l
but of this amount only i,ooo,ooo0
sacks, say 4,000,000 bushels is
as really assured. The total outcome
of crop will not under any circuim- i
S. stances fully meet the consumptive
t- demand of the United States, so a
ye that high average prices are likely P
r- to prevail if planters exercise dis- p
t- cretion and deliberation in the dis- 1
n- position of same.
