I sed the Demikratick party wuz I

There is a large percentage of
United States bonds that will be
come due in .the year 1907, and if
the bankers can influence congress
to prevent the free coinage of sil
ver, they (the bankers) can force
the lavment of their bonds in goldl,
and as they own the gold, the gov
ernment will have to Ibrr')w it and
i issue more bonds for a long term
of years, and by this means they
will be able to f ,ree another bank
charter. The record cf Iboth old
parties have been in the interest of
national banks, and will continue
to be so as long as they hhld the
reigns of the government. We
get the conclusive evidence of the
first proposition from the record,
and we draw the other conclusion
from this fact, and the further fact
that none of the pu"lic speakers,
either I)emocrat or Republican,
have ever denounced the national
banking system, but have tried to
hide this infamy under the same
old tariff twaddle. The People's
party has a plank in its plat
form demanding the abolition of
national banks, and that the issue
and control of the circulating In
dium be placed in the hands of the
people which means the govern
ment, acd that a sufficient amount
he issued and put into circulation
to do the business of the country.
Now you can only get this by vo
ting for the People's party. Keep
this in your mind.
Ma. EDITOR :-While we Democrats
are busily endorsing President ('leve
land's policy, and ascribing to him
"honesty and sincerity of purpose" in
his conduct, let us see just what we are
"paying for the fiddle."
Man's very worst enemies ha--e been
men perfectly "honest." perfectly "sin
cere," in all conduct of 'if and policy.
It is not the motire a· li"- tctuate men
that -e ju.ge them by or .pa!ud them
for, it is the rsselt of their actions.
It is ad!'itted open!y by ?hose m"ho
oppose MW. Cleveland's policy, that the
money yvestioa-i.e. a famui.le in the circu
.sting medium-Is th" basic cause of all
our ills: and tho.-e % h., avor his policy,
from whatever cause and fo, whatever
purpose, tacitly admit the correctness
of the proposition by doing all in their
power to dodge and befuddle the issue.
They pander and :promise where that
knowledge is strong. and dejounce it
where ignorance or worse prevails.
Four months ago every thinking cul
tivator of cotton knew that the price of
his product was, in relation to the price
of silver in its relation to tme price of otA.
er cemmoditf,-too high. Fifty cent
wheat in market, means less than five
cent cotton at home. The measure of
price by a contractedl and contracting
volume of the mesarisg thing must re
suit in the fall in price of the measwred
thing !
It has come, but the ed is st yet!
With a eontinued deermese in the vol
ame of money, whether from a con
traction of the gross quantity, or from
its contraction to certain fixed and re
mote centers, the fall in the priceof com
modities must be continuous.
Free trade, if it tends as contended,
to cheapen the prices of commodities
bought abroad, must only aggrivate the
evil. With a dollar, "which peases,"
according to Mr. Cleveland's word, volu
minous logic, '"for a dollar in all the
markets of the world," when it is spent
in those muarkets must deprive us of
what little circulating medium we have,
sad thus drag down to the bottomless
pit the already unrenmunerative prices we
have. With free trade and an internsation
al currency: the one fxing the ifie of
labor at the lowest point Ia the world's
wage scale: the other allowing us only
one distributive share of the money,
determined by the rule of sellingl cheap
er than our neighbors, the essdWs of
man, here and elsewhere, is fixed, nd
we have reached, as Sctentists- tell] us.
, the opening of the "age of repose" with I
the hunman race.
Let us see, Mr. Editor, ho,w much we,
southern cotton growers have paidl
within the past 3* t dlays, for the "dream of
the philosopher" -"that men are :ulade !
for governmelnt. government lnot
for mene."
The. Picayune (N. O.) of 29th Septican
her. says that the loss per pound lduring
that time has Isben 1.7 t elnt;. Estima
ting the crop at 8+ million bales. and
the weight at 500 iotlnds per Iale, we
have the ennorllus .in of E:vENTY- i
FIVE MILLION SIX II'NDI)tEI, AND FIFTY
f TOlolSAND DOLLAII, a, the grand ag-.
grgate amount we eotto'n farmers have
pau.l to this time only, and for 30 days only
for that grand and glorious dollar, I
which Mr. Echles. Mr. ('leveland's In- t
- diana lawyer, now comptroller of the
treasury, says we sees' have; "'that will
pass for a dollar, h.gal tender or no le
gal tender."
The sugar planter bolted when the
I 'dhndering ofhis inteirests was apparent
1.he poor fool cotton planter sits dewn a
nud lets Cleve'insind's New York shylhwks
rob him of everything worth living fo, t
and tihet coiIlill;ceuitly ,uiiks its too I
late. we have nothing now to bolt fer.
With bankrupt fortunes, mortgaged
homes, naketd families, half-starved and ,
ignorant children, we still stand for
"l)emocratic principles"--which none of
us could define to save our lives--and
are determined against "nuigger rule" if
it takes all our ballot box stntfers and
every "'nigger vote" alive or dead to at
tain it.
Mr. Cleveland's Denmocracy--and they
of the South, I may with shame and snr
row, have swallowed about all there was
or is of Repuhlicaniismn: They have
gulped the Senate Bill which in McKin- I
leyism,.minune, according to Mr. Carlisle,
:4 per cent; and notwithstanding it was
"personal dishonor and party perfidity,
according to Mr Cleveland iin person,
they are engaged in portraying its bean- I
ties to the "ignorant masses"; without a
grimmace they went to a gold basis and
joined .John Sherman's financiers; they
are now telling us that national banks antd
their system are the greatest things and
the greatest money system in the world; I
they have eaten with gusto the use of
I the military arm in invading a State ir
riolatios of the plain letter of the constitn
tion, and in face of the protest of the
governors of those sovereignties; nay a
conmmon United States constable has I
marched into the executive chamber of
the government of Miasissippi and ar
rested the chief officer of that 4tate for
the crime of administering its lawn, and 9
we heard not one indignant protest. ,
If they have "bolted" these things as
a party, how can they blame other peo
ple for bolting the party I
I Nanmes cannot change the nature of
things. All attempts to endorse Repnb
lieanism, and that of the rery worst type, a
and conceal it by naming it Democracy
will fool no one except he that wants to
he foolel.
ImOur fathers poor innocent souls might a
be taken in with the sort of reasoning A
resorted to by Cleveland's Democrats, but f
with us it wont work.
You remember, Mr. Editor, the indig- I
nant protest of the farmer to the mule
that demanded oats for feed, instead of
thistles--'Why, you long eared cuss I
fed yoer father on thistles, why cant you
eat t'-em as well " "'That's all right," i
A'id the mole, "'I'm not a jack ass, my
fP'me: rwas."'
Yon can apply the point. e

The Atchison Topeka and San

until it was found that they had a
violated the same law to the extent
of unlawfully paying out $7,0)0,- i

The internstate commerce comr

proof positive of the facts, the
penalty is a fine of $5,000 and two
years in the penitentiary for each
offense and now the eommission
hesitate to proceed. To quote the
associate press:
Photographic fac similies were
obtained of two rebate vouchers
callin for the return of 3,000 to el

the Atchison. In addtion there j
was obtained the arlidavrit of an em

Kolbite Convention Call.
BlaioGHaM, Ala., Sept. 2$.
The chairman of the State execu
tive committees of the Kolbite and
Populite parties to-day issued from
their beldquarters here a call for a
joint convention to meet in Mont
gomery on Nov, 12, 18094, The
call says :
"The purpose of the convention
is t' consider what action should,
he taken in regard to the mon
strous election frauds that were
perpetratel in ihe last Aiugust
election, and for other ipurposes.'t
It is reported that the purpose
of the joint convention, in view of
the fact that it is called to meet the
day before the regular legislature
convenes, is to set up an opposition
legislature, and go through the
form of declaring Kolb governor,
elect a United States senator to
sheceedSenator Morgan, and ad
journ.
The Kolbites are industriously
organizing so-called election leagues
Iall over Alabama and troble in s
feared when the convention meets,
