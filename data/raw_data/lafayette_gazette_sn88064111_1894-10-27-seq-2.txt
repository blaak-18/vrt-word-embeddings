Son --SatZirday last at
=a the bolters, and de
aisadres.s to a large assein
asthnt city. Trhe burden of his
S ei was for protection to Ameri
' industrics, according to the
*. t ciples of the Republican party.
SPhlose at whose invitation he had
-come, must have been sorely dlisap
"-o'i teid, from the fact, that the ilis
'*mtUshed visitor did not make the
slightest promise, that the Republi
Ia-n party would restore the bounty
.r place a heavier duty on sugar
: than now exists in the Wilson bill,
i-should that party be so fortunate
asto toget control of the next Con
igress. No one informed of the
status of Natiohal Republicans today
";'tould have expected Gov. M-cKin
-.:ley to have spoken otherwise. He
well knew that a word from him,
`V=.T[hat he favored a restoration of the
bounty or a heavier duty on sugar,
meant the destruction of his chances
Jor the Presidential nomination in
1 96. The Republican Party is
irretrievably committed to the policy
Sof free sugar, and no bounty. By
the McKinley law of 189o, for the
sirst time in the history- of this gov-
crnment, sugar was made free, and
a bounty of 2 cents a pound was
* leen in lieu thereof, for the term of
'nfteen years. Well nigh, every Re
ublican in the session of 1890 vot
ed for free sugar, whereas every
Democrat voted for a duty on that 1
article, in the very teeth of this Re
pnblican conspiracy to eventually 1
destroy the leading industry
of a Southern State. In the session
of congress. after a revulsion of
opinion had been expressed through
out the country, the Republicans
, hanginrg as usual with the public t
current voted to repeal
the bounty they had given the su
gtar planters four years before, and
against the restoration of the duty t
on sugar, which the I)Dnnocrats
forced upon thetn in the I
passage of the Wilson bill. 1
Thus it will be seen that G(;or. Mc- -
Kinly could not consistently make r
any promises or hold out the re- .
anatest hope in favor of sugar,
'which he new lhad been condemned i
to no protertion whatever by the h
almost unanimous votes of the Re- t
publicans in congress. '1 he gov
ernor of Ohio is too iiuch of a Re- t
piublican aihd too much of a poli- c
.. tician to have made anyv pr,:ises s
in favor of sugar, so much desired' t
by the sugar coated Republicans, of "
the WVarinoth, .McCall, Kelogg, I)e- lii
mas and Pinchback comubi:ne. It t'
would appear to ordinary mortals, a
that the High Priest of 'Protection : h
is ;n hard lnck if we are to judge ti
himn in the light of the avowed opin- (
(.
i .n of the braine;cst men of a
his own part:. Senator s!
Sherman of ( )hio, the home nx
of the new Naploleon. said in a re- ti
Ecnt speech. that he favoredl a tariff s'
for revenue p rpoises, only. Senia- 0
tor Allison is also known as a low re
tariff man. In a late interviewv con- n
grensmaan Jut'errworth of Ohio is at
credited wi ith thie statemient that ti
-there was entirely too mtuchl protec- tl
tion to special interests in the Mc- n
Kinlev act, at the exl.ense of the jt
muasses of the people. I.ast blut not b.

.Orat ,r anti statesmian of Maine,

non in a public sie-ch that the Re- Si

is Mr. Sherman, who has recently i
i- been making speeches in Ohio,
1e Governor McKinley's own State,;,
V. has given expression to a declara
Wd tion that must be considered truly t
remarkable in the face of Governor,
~ McKinley's extreme protection doc
1e trines. Said Senator Sherman:
"I ant not now and never was an extreme
protectionist. I believe that suflicient du
V ties on imported goods can be and ought to
abe lev Icried to pay expenses of the Govern- 1
I, ment in times of peace. No duties should a
to be levied for protection that are.not needed
- for revenue. These duties should he levied,
e so far as practicable am articles that conme
into competition with home industries. t
Si Other taxes, excises, including income taxes,
1- should be levied qnly for extraordinary ex- C
e penses incurred in war or other great strin
gency. Taxes on articles that we cannot
I produce, such as tea, coffee and spices,
should be so imposed when necessary toi
to meet exigencies. All duties and taxes
'{ should be so arranged in schedules as that a
a the revenues can be raised or lowered by S,
s schedules without a revision of the whole ii
tariff. I believe that these simple, just and
y adequate rules would remove the tariff
y from party strugglers nand leave the States, l
C countries and municipalities of our country g
the broad field of direct taxes necessary forr,
d local slf-governmncut." a
It would be difficult to find any- tl
f' thing more conservative and tmoder- ft
ate. This is really the Democratic ft
doctrine of 'tariff for revenue, with it
incidental protection." There is no h
talk of direct benefits to any class
of special bounties to anybody, and a]
the reason for it is simple enough. sl
The great body of the people will n7
not endure any more of that sort of ti
Ithing. The people of the West,
- and the Vest is rapidly becoming
5 the controlling section in this coun- s:
try, have grown tired of the legisla- 3'.
tion that singled out special classes' th
and enriched'them at the expense in
' of the vast majority- of the popula- 'if
tion, and they will not pertmit it to '_'
be done any longer. This is the th
t great fact looming up in :Amlericajn
politics, which M1r. Reed has seen .i
and which Senator Shrrntl an as ih
recognized, and upon whicth they -
are acting.
If Governor McKinley has not
understood the drift of evencts, or if to
he has seen but has not beien able
to act upon them, nobody shoutl d
be surprised, because his only title'
to fame, his only claim to politital Ihr
celebrity, has been his champion- s.
ship of high protection. If lie were '
to abandon that he would be aban- at;
doning everythling in his potlitical ma
life that gave hint any sort of distinc- .'
tion. To give that up :ant to start
again upon a course that must belie Ie
his entire past career is more than an
the Govenor can ldo, and it ou.ght V,.
not to be expected of 1iM11. No: th~
Govenor McKinley ki standing on
San obsolete iss(e. but there he laut l)'
stand until hlie tdies. .\ dethroxned try
monarch cannot consent to -tart at pu
the bottom and play the role of a .c|
subject. lie will continue to live I
on the past. Ie wdll remain in lio
litical hiistory as the author of i a
revenue bill which created great n.'
, mlanufacturing and commelncrcial trust whI
anti usonopolies, while it wronged tall tol
thile mias.-es of the people, and whic-h his
tile people condemned and lc
noullncedt froml the first andl abolished ag.
just as soon as they cohilt lay their '.s
hantlds on the machinery of legis- th
lation. [).
It is a recognition of thi ilapr'es- frT
sive fact that has induced Senator
Shierman and Co.',ngressman Rlee,l pal
and all other sagacious IRepulblicans, as
to abalndon the dotrine of extremuie ant
protection, and it is this fa ct which shl
has induced the \-'-Vashington Piost the: i
a:t'ite andl wideawake RKptnblican
jotururl at lthe Natioual C:apial, tile ca
,center of all Fed:ceral politics, to tot
characterize ;GovCrnor McKinley ats del
a *'back nuinber," ldevotedl to the
advocacy of obsolete political
issucs. A
All this wealts that high protection CiS
is a discarded dloctrine, and that JeL
direct (;co\vernmi ent bounties are itr
Smatters of the past, )never again to wh
;be revive-cd. T'his i.s l;l edict of the lab

But this faCt -does not militate fai
against the other fact, that,-a gross .
and brutal injustice has b~eit done
