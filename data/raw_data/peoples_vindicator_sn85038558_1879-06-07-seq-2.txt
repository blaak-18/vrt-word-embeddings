, stitlatioal sad the State Autherl

r
(New Orleans lIeiocrat. c7th May.)
Judge Billings yesterday rendered
an exceedingly lengthy decision in
e eathe cu of thie Louiiana State Lot.
o tery Company vs. John Fitzspatric)
e et a1.
The following is a synopsis of the
opinion and the fall text of the de
TI3 5.OtUIIANA STATE LOTTERT CON.
PANT ST ALU. VS. JOHN FITZPAT*
RICK ET AL.
The complainhnts have fled their
! bill in the Circuit Court of the United
States under the permission conferred
in an set of Congress approved March
3, 1875, which vested those eourts
a with "original cognizance of all suits
.of a civil nature at common law or in
, equity, arising under the constitution
and Iaws of the United States, or
treaties made or wbhich shall e made
Y under their authority." 18 Statutes
i, at Large, ch. 137, p. 470. The civil
. Jondiction of this court was by this
statute enlarged to the entire extent
of the judicial power delegatqd to the
' Congress by the terms qf the con
it etitution. Prior to this statute the
. Juriediction of this court depended in
a great meosure upon the eondition
or charamter of the parties, and upon
C particular laws of the United Statest
e this statute vests s juridiction of all
. cases which may involve the enforce.
ment of the constitution, laws and
treaties of the United States in their
Sdetermination. The jurisdiction thus
a acquired comprehends suita which the
United States or its oflcers or agents
may bring in the discharge of otleial
duty under the constitutioa, laws or
7 treaties and such as may be main.
Stained against them beeause of .1-.
e cial sets or obligations. Besides these
are ombraced the eases between indi
viduals and corporations where the
II constitution, laws or treates of the
United States shall form the immedio
ate and detlmining cause of the eon
toversy, and this fact is exhibited to
the court in such form that the court
Ican take cogniuzance of it. Until the
Squestion is so submitted and is thus
f made, the iudicial power does not at,
tebh. Prior to tills enactment the
powere which the Congress had not
Sbestowed upon the Federal courts by
legislative provisions were dosmant,
becasuse that authority had not de.
signated the tribunal which should
be authorized to employ them. 'hlis
* interpretation of this clause of the
s constitution is announced in Martin
vs. 'Hunter I Wh. 304; Osborn vs.
i Bonk, 9 Wh. 738; Alemn vs. Booth,
21t How. 506; Mayor vs. Cooper, 6
I Will, 247; Cohen vs. Virginia, 6 Wh.
2 I64; and Bank of the United States
vs. Roberts, 4 Coon. 323.
The opinion then briefly recites the
allegations in the bill of complaint,
to wit: The granting to it by the
f Legislature corporate rights sad priv.
a ileges for a term of twenty.five years,
the payment of monesy to the State
aunder the shater, the enjoyment of
Srights, until the passage of the re.
r psallug at by the. Legislature, the
wreat of the State to ccsept further
a pyments of mooney, that the set ia.
Iprs the obligatin ot a eoetreet and
i that te Oesaral assembly in passing
Sit leavi violated the irohibitory clause
I ot the coastitatioa. "These facts

Tn Mi tal. this poi.t Ju.dge i.
i quoted from 6 Wall Sas andl
continiauI, said: "A us arisi

whech its terms import."
The court then, in further consider.
.ation of the question, laid down the
propositions: First-That a mere
license to draw lotteries which is not
inseparable from the exuen!ihe fun.
tions of a corporation, and which ha.
not been acted npon, and under which
no rights have been vested, may be
repealed by any succeeding Legiala.
tore of the State in which it is grant
ed; and. seepnd, that when a license
to draw lotteries has been acted upnn
and under it rights have been vested,
it esannot be withdrawn hby the Llgis.
latare to the prejudice of these rights,
and the pewer of the Legihlarfre to
recall or modify it is to that extent
gone. '"*
These propositions were argued' at
considerable length, and to establish
them quotations and references as
follows, were made: Davis vs,
Caldwell, 2 Robinson Rep. 271--27;
the State vs. Jacob Hawthorne, I
Missouri Rep, 385; Phelan vs. the
Co.mmonwealth, l Robinson (Virgin.
is) Rep. 73; State vs. Phelan and
Bayie, 3 Hantington Rep. 441 ; Greg.
ory vs. the Trustees of Shelby Col.
lege. 2 Metealf (Kentucky) Rep. 389;
Phelan vs. State of Virglinia, 8 How
ard 163.
The court said frther that not
alone with reference to lotteries was
the immorality of the eonsideration
revoked, and to establish that the
rulings and decisions had been the
same, reference was made to Osborne
vs. Nicholson, 13 Wall. 654; Boyce
vs. Sable, 18 Wall., 546; Delmas vs,
the Inbsrnace Co. 14 Wall. 661; M.
sad W. B. Co. vs. King, I Otto 3.
The position take by the court, a.
set forth in the two prepositions and
established by the authorities refer.
red to, was enlarged upon and elabo
rated at considerable length, and the
averments in the bill of complaint
were takes up and considered as en.
tablisbing tiLe character of the char
tar and franebhises of the Louisiana
State Lottery Company. How fai
the rights held by the company were
corporate ,franchises was inquired
into, and after an extensive review
of the entire subject the eourt deeid.
ed that the qualities of the corpora.
tinH do not belonga to licenses and d,
belong to corporate bodies, holding
by a legislative contract, and decided
that "the repealing act of 187, then,
is not .'peratire to take away the
privileges and rights of the Louisiana
State Lottery Company. The Ameri
ean authorities are adverse to the
Legislature having any such right.
The question of right Ihaving been es.
tablished as well as that of wrong
committed by the enactment, tlhe
question remains to be cousidered
whether the existence and enjoyment
of the franchises and rights of the
plaintiff can be forfeited by the use
of the writ of injnuction."
In passing- upon this question the
court chiefly Considered the point
urged by the Attorney General, "that
the prohibition of the Revised Slt.
utes, section 79, which is section 3
of the act of 1793, which prohibits
courts of the United Slates from
staying by injunction proceedings in
any court of a State, should, prevent
this court from granting an injune
ties," and the court decided that the
ease quoted by the Attorney General
(Supervisors vs. Durant) to maintain
his proposition was not .parallel
case, nor on in point, beeause the
q.ietion Involved did not turn oulan
priority of jurisdiction. He laid
down the proposition that section 14
of the aets of 1879 established and
provided that "time Federal courts
shall have power to isne all writs
which may be necessary for the ex
eraese of their srespecti ve juriedictions;
apd secondly, that if the Federal
enorts had not the power to restrain
parties from thlereafter Iostituting
troese tugs i a Iltate court a de
fendant could in many ways defeat
the Jurisdietion sad action of the
Federal court after it had obtained
fill juridictioe of the person and of
the subjee attter. I see no answeo r
to tbh reasoning." .
In support of this position the eourt
eitled Bavapth vs. Camden Railroad
0empsmy, B~ldermo C. C. . 905, 233;
Aswold vs. ank of the Gaited 8tates,
9 Wh., 740, and many oltmers, and
