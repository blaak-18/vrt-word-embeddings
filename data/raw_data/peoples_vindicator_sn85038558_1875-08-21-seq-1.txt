is a great diversity of opinion in re
to gard to the damage of the cotton crop

Sly a're equally as possitive that it will

I Confession of the Nicholsons.
My name is lHenry Nicholson, I
have been farming till Col. Rouhieux's
t phace; the first warning I hiad of
a trouble was the alpperarance of a
t squad of ien who camell to Col. Ron
bieux's in search of ile, saying I had
committed murder. I heard that they
t intended hanging nime; through fear,
3 brother and I avoided arrest more for i
personal safety than we did the law.
The time the squad canlc to my house
I met and spoke to Mfr. Webster and
a another man in the road, they said i
nothing to me as to their object. I
I don't know anything of the nmurder
of Young ; I bought goods of him aind
I paid for them. Col. Roubicux's Son I
and Tom. Lonasell, saw mue bu itli
niokf'lute 'nnt 'Wcit over to Guts.
Bird's. Young's geoods were brought
to my hiouee after I left home. After
I hearieng of the intention of the crowd,
I went to ily brothers house, a mile
distant alnd asked himi if any one J
had been there, and lie answeredr yes.
From Baptiste. I heard that trouble
was ahead, lie told ine that at night. t
Had no 'serious trouble with Col.
Ronbieux, lie offered to tight any.
way, but I refused to have any dif
ficulty ; lie proposed to buy my crop e
or sell mei his, I agreed to sell, and t
he told me that lie would pay part t
cash and give his dr'aft for the bal
ance, which I agreed to. After leav
ing home, myself and Bro., were in ,
the woods adjacent eight or ten days, t
iund were poisotned by a negro named (
Henry Dallas, who was to feed us.
Thile evenilng we were poisoned I wasI
at Canon's and a squad of men came I
up and I ian away, they fired at me I.
without telling mre to' ihalt, the shots a
did niot touch nie. W' left this sec
tioen that evening ; never saw another i
squad until we got to Nelns, saw
two men there wihoe canme up and 'I
made enquiry (or us aind we ran away,
they ftired at ius, one ball pjassing U
through my hat, did'ot get wounded; i
stoped to pull off my shoes in the ,
field. Froml Nelm's we went to i
Dunce D)awkin's, in Union parish, a
and there another isquad calle upon .
ui, we were ini the orchard at tilet
time, ard stelpped outside, and fromi s
tllere went -toward Arknusis. er oss- a
ing the Ouichita hiver at Willimgton, t
and went sixteen mniles east ; was ait j
Mrs. Parker's when the suaIed that i,
captured us came up, and was niot
asleep. The head mnU sahid the squEld
vwould protkct us freom m~lcz , ndw kil we
did not try to escape on the way to t
Conslatta. el
Our rllorter then asked him what
hlie tlholught or knew of thie nlysterms A
dislappearance of Oglesly, and lHenry ,
viry prldiptly and willinglyl answer-.
ed: - ii
I don't know anylthiig alont the r
Ogleiablv mnlurder. They say Torn lien- ti
ton kilied him., Tonl hlaiiuton was at v
my lhouse at the time Oglesby was c
killed.' The reporter repeatedl his ln
question and Niclholson dlolln't know a
whiem Oglesby was killed. In answer fC
as to how they. left lhere aud how e
they were arpied, the samne pallt'y
said i We left here on foot ; we "had i
a 'alit gun eachi and thromgh fatigue ,
and wanit, we sold one guin to a negro A,
man living near Tulip, this sidel of a
Ilolner. He was to p1ty $12 in money
ai!ld transport ns that day in'a wagon ; II
never got a cent of money for thli
guln; passed tlhroughl Alrizoilia anda
Lislon in day lilghlt. n
The Nicliolsons were captured in ,
Calhounn county, Ark., at Mrs. Par- c

Kettle Drum.-Pound three ounces
of almonds, quarter of a pound of
butter, two ounces of loaf sugar, with
a little rose-water, till it becomes a
thick paste. Spread it on a buttered
tin, divide it into eight cakes; bake it
in a slow oven. When cold put a
spoonfill of preserve on each cake,
and eover with whipped cream.
Berkesire HIogs.-Will it pay to
raise pure Berkshire hogs? I know
of no better way of atisweing tlhe
above than by giving any own expe
rience with a pair of pigs bought of
Colonel Colman. They were farrow
ed early in October last; and had
certainly received ver.fiirdinary care,
as they weighed only sixty-eight
pounds on the 23d of De~mnbeu, when
I received them--the male witghiung
thirty two pounds. From thiaC time
until the 12th of February I fed noth
iutg but whole coin and kitchen slo 1,
and not Ai inuch c--erh as tllhe~~WlId
have eaten by-a.atma&deal. I thea
reweighed the male, jind found that
he had gained flfty..it n ounuds, being
a firactiou over ole pound per day.
The weather during that. time was
extremely cold, which, no doubt, very
materially hindered the feed frto
producing thl.nunaib- b0, r"eUla e t
would have ..l..u hIuad the weather
been more 'mild. At this time' he
.eighs more pounds than he is days

any thling but dry corn.
The Fedijug of. Young Turkeys,-.
Why is it ihat one farmer will raise
nearly every turkey-chick that comes
out of the shell, and do thi* nine
years out of ten, without muoh res
pect to wet or dry seasons, while an
other loses from half to .three-quar
ters with about the samo uniformity ?
We know of men with whom success
is the established rule. Tley are
very systematic in this, as in all their
other basiness. We visited one of
these thrifty fartnersi who rmuted 165
turkeys last year from nine hied, and
upon inquiry found that he did about
the same thing ever* year. We
wanted to know jast how he managed
to secure this nitform result, and
foltund him eommunlicative. lIe insiats

lie places great relianie upon regu
lar feeding during the fall and winter,
so that the flock becomes very gen,.
tie, and the hlens make their nests
imlmediately about the sheds and
barns in places prepared for thenm.
'This is a great safeguard against
foxes, skniks, Crows,. hawks, and
other creatures that destroy thile birds
or their eggs. - When the younlg l rst
come eof the nest they are confined
in pens for a few days until they are
strong enough to 11fy3' over a board in
closure one fo,,t high. lie feeds fre

sour milk intil four o'clock in the

tat hlie lost a good many chicks fruum

is daniger from over-teeding. As thi
lchicks grow, the sollr.milk diet is in
creased, and during the slimmer it i
kept cosltanltly in the trough for
lthem. They are exceedingly nud coi

An ilcidental advanlltageanlld a very
