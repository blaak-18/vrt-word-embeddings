the august cat.
Oh, listen to my plaintive plea;
And may your hearts be touched
thereat!
I am, as all the world can see,
A harmless, necessary cat.
The luggage now is in the hall,
Portmanteaus lie upon the mat;
Awaiting for the van to call—
And no one’s thinking of the cat.
They’re off, as off last year they went,
’Tis still within my memory pat,
How on their pleasure’s plan intent
They overlooked their friend, the
cat.
Till then, supplied with daily milk,
Well fed, well liking, sleek and
fat,
My tabby coat, as smooth as silk,
I lived a glad, contented cat.
But on my own resources cast
My food as best I could, I gat,
And till the holidays were past
I prowled, a stray and starveling
cat.
They left me plump, they found me
thin,
Yea, wasted to a shadow flat,
A bag of bones incased in skin —
The ghostly semblance of a cat.
No single cup of milk to drink
For thirty days! Just think of
that!
And pray your readers, all to think
Os what awaits the August cat.
—Our Dumb Animals.
W
HEN the humane officer in
Winsted, Connecticut, went
to investigate a case of al
leged cruelty, which con-
sisted of a young girl being apparent
ly compelled to break rocks, he was
confronted with the astounding state
ment of the happy miss (wearing
overalls) that she simply preferred
breaking rock to housekeeping. The
officer withdrew, doubtless pondering
the thing deeply in his heart.
Given health and strength, free
dom of motion through comfortable
wearing apparel, and there is small
doubt but that many a woman would
prefer breaking rocks upon the high
way to doing the tedious and not
less exhausting toil that comes to
her lot at home. The inability to
“settle down’’ to any one thing is
subversive of good results. There
is no man on earth who could make
a success of a business which de
manded that his mind be almost
every other moment turned in some
new direction, or that his attention
be upon one thing while he tried to
do another. Men are successfully in
charge of many a diversified busi
ness, but they manage it by letting
subordinates look after the different
details.
When the very wise, deep people
who solve problems all in a breath
portentiously declare that “girls
should be taught housekeeping,” they
think they have let fall a great
thought. But, in point of fact, there
is not a ray of science in the whole
thing, or any very early show of
Under the Vine and Fig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
making it scientific. Housekeeping
embraces so many arts, trades and
sciences, together with so much
downright manual labor that after
all these ages there is yet no real
standard of housekeeping, and no
two women who keep house just
alike. Learning to “cook,” that, ac
cording to mankind, acme of a wo
man’s accomplishments, stops with
preparation of food for consumption
and doesn’t imply, by any means,
that the housekeeping will be any
better, or the meals themselves any
simpler or more scientific.
There would be no possible ex
cuse for a home (with its manifold
drudgery and disadvantages) were it
not that within the home only do we
have our individual tastes consulted
as to what we shall eat, how we shall
dress and deport ourselves, and so
forth. For the privilege of doing
measurably as we please within our
own domicile, the race sacrifices the
easier mode of living that would
come under the co-operative schemes.
There doesn’t seem to me to be
anything so oppressively dreary, so
utterly objectionable, as existence
savoring of communism. I would
rather have a shack in the middle of
a desert, where I could keep my own
hours, have my own way, eat any
sort of indigestibles I fancied, than
to live under the most wholesome
clock-work of another’s devising, in
obedience to rules and regulations
that had been framed only for “the
general good.”
There being no hope in commun
ism, hcme-keeping must remain to
the end of the chapter, unspecialized.
Therefore, hard. It behooves so
ciety, however, in the face of the
growing unwillingness on the part of'
women to face it, to consider ways
and means to make it no more ar
duous than the majority of other oc
cupations.
In the first place, the “servant
problem” would probably vanish by
desiring more of service and less of
servility. That is to say, let domes
tics be trained in different specialties
and employ a class of helpers who
would not have to be treated as the
servants now are. White help? Os
course; the negro servant is simply
the poor excuse that must be put up
with, along with the rest of our bur
dens.
Many housekeepers would throw
up their hands at this; but these
have never experienced the reliable,
efficient sort of white domestic help
in other sections. They are thinking
of the white slattern, in contrast to
which an ordinarily neat and indus
trious negro girl is the lesser evil.
The individual home should be
simplified in every respect. This is
slowly, but surely, being done. Wo
men are no longer wearing out their
energies sweeping tawdry carpets,
dusting cheap bric-a-brac, polishing
pots and pans that were meant for
service, not ornament, or wasting so
many precious hours on impossible
tidies, throws, and other hideous and
worthless draperies. The laundry
should invariably have all the hard,
heavy work, such as sheets, blankets,
counterpanes, table cloths, etc., as
3effersonian
well as shirts and shirt-waists that
are hard to do up. And "why, in the
name of common sense, should tow
els, wash-cloths, dish-rags and ordi
nary knitted underwear be ironed at
all? Fold and put away fresh from
the sun and air.
If women themselves would only
wake up to a profitable interest in
such things as fireless cookers, pa
tent dish-washers, washers, etc.,
weeks of time and incalculable
strength could be saved to the house
mothers of this country, for inven
tors would turn their attention to
such devices, make new ones, and
perfect the ones we now have.
To “teach women housekeeping”
is almost absurd in the face of the
present chaotic conditions. The girl
who is taught to “keep house” and
never does anything else, very fre
quetly proves to be, in after years,
the weary woman who “putters
about,” suspicious of innovation,
stubbornly unprogressive, doing doz
ens of things after wrong, labori
ous methods, wasting her time and
strength to no purpose unless it be
the vague one of martyrdom to “the
way I’ve always done.”
Those who quickest learn to order
a home, to take up the best meth
ods available, are oftenest those who,
having been trained in some other
business, learn the value of time, the
need of concentration, and the econo
my of machinery. They learn to
scorn the course dinner that is no
more palatable than a simple, dainty
supper, and which causes tired serv
ants to work during the hours in
which rest should rightfully be
theirs, and to hate in general the
lack of consideration for others which
is the basis of the servant problem,
and to be amused at the “penny wise,
pound foolish” ways of the woman
whose time has never been paid for,

products.
All of which will cause the com
placent “home-body” to say: “Oh,
very well, but if she had my work to
do, and my John’s peculiarities to
contend with, or my crowd of chil
dren to litter up everything just as
soon as her trained domestics put it
in order, she’d find out a few things!”
Which doesn’t “feaze” any one at
all, or the point made, which is that,
while housekeeping will never be a
snap, and rearing children along
with it will add to it kaleidoscopic
complications, a business-like and
scientific conception of the details of
the work, a value of herself and of
her subordinates, will do wonders to
remove the profession of housekeep
ing from the bad eminence it occu
pies in the minds of 99 out of every
100 women, and give real home-mak
ing a chance to rear its lovely head
from the ruck of the useless, need
less, soul-and-body-destroying diffi
culties of housekeeping which here
tofore and at the present good mo
ment threaten its very existence.
“SHE WHO DREAMS.”
A Maori’s idea of a woman is ex
pressed in the phrase “she who
dreams,” which means that her
thoughts are on a higher plane than
his.
He allows her absolute freedom of
speech and manner, for he is sure
that if there is anything to be said
or done a woman’s refinement and
sincerity will exceed his own.—La
dies’ Field.
And yet, if we are not mistaken,
the Maori people is the only uncon
quered race. Which shows that the
truly brave w r ill never fail in chivalry.
Weak, vain men, who can not com
pete to advantage with the stronger
of their own sex, are usually to be
found arrayed against granting any
rights to women; making, in fact,
the “last ditch” stand for an artifi
cial superiority granted by law,
where natural equality is denied by
nature.
