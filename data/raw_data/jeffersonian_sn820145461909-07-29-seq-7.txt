WOULD LIKE TO BE A MILLINER.
I am a little country girl, thirteen
years old. I think every boy and
girl should strive for an education.
Papa takes the Jeffersonian, also the
Jeffersonian Magazine. He thinks he
could not do without them. He is
always glad when they come. I go
to school and like to go fine. My
teacher’s name is Miss Delrey Adams.
lam in the fifth grade. I would like
to be a milliner. I will ring off by
saying good-bye to Daddy Jim and
the many readers of the paper. If this
does not fall in the waste basket, I
will come again.—Minnie Winn,
Royston, Ga.
LIKES FARM WORK.
I live on a farm. I like farm work
fine. My father is a farmer. Igo
to school at Sumner, Ga. I also take
music. I like the Jeffersonian fine.
I like to read it.- —Lilamae Pole, 10
years old, Sumner, Ga.
(Daddy Jim wishes that you and
Miss Minnie Winn would ask your
school teachers if such a phrase as
“I like it fine” is correct, and if not,
why not. If we are going to write at
all, we might as well write good Eng
lish while we are about it. Don’t
you think so?)
FOR AN INTELLIGENT FARMER.
I hope to be a successful farmer,
have a good education, and be intelli
gent, like Mr. Watson. I like to read
the Jeffersonian fine, especially the
‘‘Post-Card Club.” I think Mr. Wat
son is doing a noble work for the peo
ple.—Hosea Murphy, 12 years old, R.
F. D. 1, Allen, Ala.
(There’s that ‘‘like it fine” again.
Is it right?)
THE KNIFE’S A BEAUTY.
I reside six miles from Crawford
ville, Ga., and have resided in Wal
ton County all my life until January
15, 1909. Mr. Watson has many sup
porters in this section. I received
my knife all O. K.; it’s a beauty. I
am spending my vacation hoeing cot
ton, bathing and fishing. I go bath
ing in the Ogeechee River. I am
sending you my photo; am 15 years
of age, and a whole-souled Democrat
of the Jeffersonian type.—Louis Bur
ton, Crawfordville, Ga.
(We will use your photograph in
the September number of the maga
zine; it was too late for the August
number, which will be out in a day
or two.)
I WANT TO BE A CLERK.
Will you make room for another
little country girl in your large class
of children? Papa takes the Jeffer
sonian, and I likei to read it. I like
dje □Jeffersonian
i go to school, and I am in the fifth
grade. My teacher’s name is Mr.
Burnette. I am visiting my cousin
now. It has rained a lot here this
year; it has rained so much that but

work. I want to be a clerk. I will
close by saying good-bye to the many
readers of the good Jeffersonian. I am
thirteen years old. —Floy Harris,
Royston, Ga.
WANTS THE POST-CARDS.
I am a little orphan girl, 12 years
old. I am living with my uncle and
aunt, H. P. Rowell, who is a reader
of your paper. He thinks there is
nobody like you. I see in your paper
that you give away free to every
reader the full set of 15 beautiful
post-cards, four colors, and gold-back
finish, consisting of a series called
“Beauties of Friendship.” Please
send them to me.—Mary Pearl Wil

FROM A NAMESAKE.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson—Kind
Friend: As I have seen some of the
girls’ letters who are named for you,
I could not stand the suspense any
longer, so I took this opportunity to
write to you. I have your full
name, which Ido appreciate. I am
called “Tommie” by everyone, except
my mother. She calls me “Thomas,”
and sometimes “Thomas E. Watson.”
I am fifteen years old, and am in the
eighth grade. I go to school at the
Banks Stephens Institute, Forsyth,
Ga. The other day, as I was looking
over some papers which father had
placed away, to my surprise I came
across your photograph in the At
lanta Weekly Constitution. Its date
was July 13, 1903. I was very proud
to have it, but I would have been too
proud to have had one made in 1909.
I heard you speak here in Forsyth
last November. I had the pleasure
of shaking hands with you, but as the
people were in such a crowd I did not
have the opportunity to make myself
known to you. I have dark hair,
gray eyes, and fair complexion.—Lit
tle Miss Thomas E. Watson Thigpen,
Forsyth, Ga.
(Daddy Jim would like to have
your photograph to publish in the
* September number of our magazine.
Why don’t you ask some of your
friends to subscribe to the weekly or
the magazine for a year, and give
you a dollar to pay for it; you send
the dollar to us, and we will send you
a handsome knife, with a transparent
handle containing a splendid photo
graph of Mr. Watson as he is today.)

“By George, I never saw anything
like the effects of that new treatment,
Protone, for the building up of weight
and lost nerve force. It acted more
like a miracle than a medicine,” said
a well known gentleman yesterday in
speaking of the revolution that had
taken place in his condition. “I be
gan to think that there was nothing
on earth that could make me fat. I
tried tonics, digestives, heavy eating,
diets, milk, beer and almost everything
else you could think of, but without
result. I had been thin for years, and

Any Man Or Woman Who Is Thin Can
Recover Normal Weight By the Re
markable New Treatment, Protone,
began to think it was natural for me
to be that way. Finally I read about
the remarkable processes brought
about by the use of Protone, so I de
cided to try it myself. Well, when I
look at myself in the mirror now, I
think it is somebody else. I have put
on just 30 pounds during the last
month and never felt stronger or more
‘nervy’ in my life.”
Protone is a powerful inducer of nu
trition, increases cell-growth, makes
perfect the assimilation of food, in
creases the number of blood-corpus
cles, and as a necessary result builds
up muscles and solid, healthy flesh, and
rounds out the figure.
For women who can never appear
stylish in anything they wear because
of their thinness, this remarkable
treatment may prove a revelation. It
is a beauty maker as well as a form
builder and nerve strengthener.
It will cost you nothing to prove the
remarkable effects of this treatment.
It is absolutely non-injurious to the
most delicate system. The Protone
Company, 1530 Protone Bldg., Detroit,
Midi., will send to anyone who sends
name and address, a free 50c package
of Protone, with full instructions, to
prove that it does the work. They
will also send you their book on “Why

facts which will probabiv astonish you.
