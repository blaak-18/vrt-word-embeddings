JEWISH BOY SENT TO PRISON FOR HIS RELIGION
Amazing Story of Racial Persecution in New York; 16 Year Old Boy Defeats
Attack of Rabbis and Lawyers; But Court Sends Him To Prison.
From Dearborn Independent ,
Nov. 3, 1923.
Is it possible to jail people
in the United States because of
their religion? It is not only
possible, but has been done.
On the writer’s desk lies thb ■
bound transcript of a court case
inscribed—“ Kings County Surro
gate’s Court. Matter of Guard-
ianship of Harry Bucatetein.”
This means, plainly, the Court of
Honorable George A. Wingate,
Surrogate, at Brooklyn, New
York.
COLO.
Harry Bucalstein, now nearly 18
years old, was born in Russia. He at
tended a Jewish school, an institu
tion where the children go early in
the morning and remain until night.
In the year 1913 his family came to
the United States, settling in Abing
don, Illinois, removing'from that place
to New York in 1920. In. Abingdon,
disliking to associate with the Jews
whom he found there, the boy attend
ed the Rev. Dr. Bollinger’s church,
the first Methodist, where he heard
an exposition of Christian doctrine.
Q. “Did your parents know about
your attending church?” A. “They
did and they encouraged it.” Q.
“Who encouraged it?” A. “My
father.” Q. “What did he say?”
A. “He said it would do me good to
wabch the various insane beliefs that
people had.”
In New York the boy fell into
temptation. Sent out to collect some
bills, he ran off with $17.80. This act
made Harry Bucalstein an outlaw, in
his own conscience. It gnawed upon
his mind every day and night. On the
streets of New York one October
ryght in 1921 he heard a voice shout
ing above the din, “Repent, repent,
and believe the Gospel.” Moving to
the circle of people he saw a street
speaker, a Jew, who was preaching
the Christian Gospel. The speaker
was Rev. Charles Wiesenberg, a min
ister of the church known as the Di
ciples of Christ, and superintendent
of the Washington Heights Mission.
The Beginning of the Boy’s Trouble.
That night began one of the strang
est stories ever spread upon the re
cords of an American court. The boy
went to Dr. Haldeman’s church and
Dr. Holloway’s, attending the “John
3:16 Mission,” the Washington
Heights Mission, and other religious
places. November was a month of
uneasiness for him, a new uneasiness
added to the mental discomfort caused
by his theft. In December, face to
face with the need of restitution if
he would start life anew, he confessed
his theft to Mr. Wiesenberg. The man
from whom he had stolen was a Jew.
The man to whom he confessed was a
“converted *lew,” called by the Jews
a “renegade.” But forthwith the
Jewish Christian took the boy to the
Jewish employer, a Mr. LeGlaire, who
proved to be a considerate, kindly
man. He was ready to forget. He
refused to take the first payment of
fered him by Mr. Wiesenberg on the
boy’s behalf. Satisfactory arrange
ments were made for Harry to pay
back the debt at"sl a week, and the
confidence placed in the boy was war
ranted. He continued to work and
pay until* arrested and thrown into
jail—for being a Christian.
For with his theft confessed and
restitution arranged, Harry was bap
tized on January 8, 1922, by Rev.
Edward S. Holloway, of the Wads
worth Avenue Baptist Church, New
York City.
What follawed for the boy, as told
on the witness stand, will not be re
printed here, because it concerns his
mother. The curses and tortures and
tlark ecclesiastical objurgations and
incantations make a moving story.
“She said all Jews who became Christ
ians should be killed,” said the boy.
“Their hands and feet shall be brok
en. Then she ran toward me with
hatchet upraised. She did not bring
the hatchet down. I stood perfectly
still. Then I took my hat and went
out. I rode on the Subway all night.”
Now, under Jewish law, a boy is
free at the age of thirteen. He is
said to have reached the age of re
ligious responsibility. It is his Bar
Mizwah. Harry Bucalstein was near
ly sixteen when he made his choice.
Arrested for Becoming a Christian.
On January eight, next, he was ar
rested on the street. The charge was
“disorderly child,” brought under
the statute of New York City which
provides that “all children actually
or apparently under the age of six
teen who desert their homes without
good or sufficient cause shall be
deemed disorderly children.” Harry
had “deserted” his mother’s home to
go to his sister’s home.
Four weeks passed in custody.
Justice Wilkins, of the Children’s
Court was ready to let the boy have
his chance, but not so “The Jewish
Big brothers’ Association of Brook
lyn” which was now in the case. It
might be impossible to prove crime
against the boy, but maybe he could
be shown to be insane. This struck
a new fear to the heart of Harry’s
friends. It was not the first time
that converted Jews had been dis
posed via the asylum route. What
the boy tells of efforts to work upon
his nerves will not be repeated here.
But he came off triumphant, a five
per cent demerit mark being given
because his head was filled with “re
ligious ideas.’ 1 Imprisoned with the
worst classes of young criminals, he
held meetings and read his Bible to
the other boys.
Try Prison Sentence.
The alienist having passed the boy,
the next hope of punishing him was
prison. Liberated from the Children’s
Court in the custody of a Jewish pro
bation officer, the boy’s path was
difficult enough, but it was the court’s
order that he should sleep at his
mother’s house, and he did. Every
night the words of the ancient Jew
ish curse were pronounced over him,
he testified. They brought him be
fore small gatherings that questioned
and hectored him. A New York pub
lic school room was used for one of
these inquisitions. In May the pres
sure upon him became so strong that
he broke his parole, was remanded to
the Children’s Court, and was certain
ly on his was to prison (where he af
terward landed) when friends took up
his cause. .
The trial was precipated by- his
friends applying to the court for the
appointment of a guardian over him.
The applicants, of course, took the
position that Harry Bucalstein was
being persecuted because of his re
ligion; Jewish Big Brothers’ As
cosiation, with three lawyers and
rabbis assisting the cross-examina
tion, took the position that the boy
was unruly and should be punished*
The case was heard by Surrogate
Wingate.
Jew Sorry For Boy
What was behind all the legal
phraseology may be seen from the
testimony of Theodore Teitch, an en
graver, who testified that he was a
Jew and he belonged to no Chris
tian society. He was asked how he
came to ■- knowledge of the case.
“Mrs. Teitch told me that Mrs.
Bucalstein is having some trouble
with her boy. And I asked her just
what the trouble was and she told
me that she is wishing that someone
would aid her in some way or other
to commit Harry Bucalstein to the
Blackwell’s Island for becoming a
Christian. She told me that he was
a very good boy. “An<f how is he
now?’ And she told me that he is
much better toward her as he was be
fore, but she didn’t want to have any
Christian in her family. Whereas I
answered her, *L would rather see the
boy be a good Christian than a bad
Jew.’ And she further asked me if
I would go to a rabbi of Brooklyn for
Jhe boy to bring him back to his first
belief. And I told her I am not
going to no rabbi before I see the boy
myself. An the next day he came,
with the consent of his mother.”
Q. “Came to your place of busi
ness, did he?” A. “Yes, sir. And
I spoke to him about this matter and
said to him. ‘Why did you change
your belief?’ and he answered me, ‘I
have not changed my belief at all but
I have fulfilled the promise of God.’
I'asked him to show me how right he
is, that is has fulfilled those words of
God, and hejias shown me many chap
ters of the Torah, has shown me the
Psalms of David, and he has convinc
ed me through a firm belief that
Christ Jesus is the suffering Messiah
of the Israelites.”
Gives Boy Jest
But the shrewd Jew was not- to
rest only on words. He gave Harry
S2OO to go and pay a bill. The boy
came back with the receipt. Then he
sent him to carry SI,OOO worth of
jewelry through the streets. It came
safely. That settled Mr. Tetich.
The Jewish lawyers against Harry
tore into Mr. Titch like lions.
Q. “Why are you interested in this
case?”
A. “I am interested in this case
because I know that Harry Bucalstein
is absolutely innocent to* be brought
up here or to any court to put him
away until he is twenty-one years of
age for his religious belief.” -
Q. “Do you mean to sit there and
tell me and tell this court that you
as a Jew down in your heart came
here voluntarily to testify to the fact
that you want to see this boy’s re
ligion changed?” _
The Surrogate—“ The witness has
not testified to any such thing.”
Q. “What prompted you to test
out Harry Bucalstein?”
A. “To see whether Christianity
makes worse or better.”
Q. “Why are . you interested in
Christianity?”
A. “Because I am a Jew.”
Q. “Will you please explain to me
why as a Jew you should be interest
ed in seeing if Harry Bucalstein after
he became a Christian was a better
boy or not?”
An Intelligent Jew Gives His
Opinion
A. “I was told also when I was
young that Christian people are not
reliable, were murderers, and I have
the same opinion all the time uptil I
read a few passages of the Old and
New Testament, and I have seen the
action of' Christian people, and 1
have found in my opinion that it is
not so. Nor does it say in any part
of the Old Testament whether Chris
Th© CALL OF THE NORTH
tian people evey existed at that time,
but the Bible does say that there will
come a day when there will be a new
name of people as we have never
heard of before, and I have been
brought *o this conclusion, that it is
the Christian people, but that they are
the real people, that God has eaid of
this name.”
Q. “You have formed a conclu
sion now that the right religion is
the Christian religion?”
A. “I am talking ”
Q. “Yes, or no, please.” '
A. “No.”
That will suffice to show what was
the real motive behind the persecu
tion of Harry Bucalstein. But before
passing this phase, salute Mr. Teitch
as a modern Gamaliel. Would that
his justice of mind were more widely
found.
“The Jewish Big Brothers’ Associa
tion” claimed that.the boy was not
old enough to decide for himself what
religion he should take up. • Their
suggested assistance was that he
should be given a jail term to think it
over. In court they were allowed to
eamine him up and down and across
the whole field of theology, Jewish
and Christian. Four lawyers and a
lawyer rabbi were pitted against him
in one of the strangest examinations
ever held in a court room. And at
the end of one very long and fierce
contest the lawyers confessed them
selves worsted and asked to be per
mitted to bring in more expert
examiners. Bucalstein’s attorney ob
jected. “It seems to me, if the Court
please, that the Jewish counsel who
has been examining him, a very able
attorney, should be quite the equal
of a sixteen-year-old boy in such a
test.”
The Surrogate: “Without wishing
to affront that counsel in the slight
est degree,. I think you flatter him
unduly.”
The Boy Goes Under Legal Fire.
So the examination was started
again, this time by a rabbi lawyer,
Samuel Buchler.
Q. “How many hours did you
spend in the Hebrew school?” A.
“I believe from after breakfast un
til sometimes we fall asleep over
our books.”
Q. By the Surrogate: “At what
hour?” A. “About nine o’clock in
the evening.”
Q. (Continued by the rabbi):
“How did you renounce your Jewish
religion when you were baptised?”
A. “I didn’t renounce the Jewish
religion when I was baptized.”
Q. “If they wanted to ask you
to renounce the Jewish religion would
you have refused?” A. They did
not ask me that.” Q. “Would you
have refused?” A. “I don’t know.
They never asked me that, so I can’t
say.” Q. “How then did you ac
cept the Christian faith without re
nouncing the Jewish faith?” A. “I
did not have to renounce it.”
Q. “You say you have not re
nounced the Jewish faith? Do you
consider yourself now a Christian or
a Jew?” A. “I consider myself
now a Christian. I never Was a
Jew.”
Q. “Until that time you Were a
Jew?” A. “Until that time I was
a Hebrew of the Tribe of Levi.
That is why you can’t call me a Jew.”
Q. “Were all your family de
scendants of Levi?” A. “All my
father’s brothers and ancestors were.
My mother is not. She is an Israel
ite.” Q. “And if any one was to
ask you whether you were a Cohen,
a priest, or not, what would you
say?” A. “I would say I was.” Q.
“Do you believe, young man, that you
can be a Jewish priest and at the
same time a Christian?” A. “I do,”
In Jail, Not Church
.Q. “Now, at the present time, do
you go to any church?”
The Surrogate: “No. He is lock
ed up; he is in the custody at the
law.”
Q. “You-never heard of anyone
turning from Jewish to Christian for
gain?” A. “No, sir; nobody has
ever done it. That is one of their
claims, but is not true.”
Q. “May I ask whether you are
circumcised?” A. “I am a circum
cised Hebrew. The first person that
was circumcised was not a Jew, for
he was Abraham, and Abraham was
not a Jew, he was a Gentile.”
The young man was very insistent
on this distinction between Jews and
Israel. In a brush with the lawyers
on the same point he apparently
piqued their interest, for they ques
tioned him closely.
Q.' “What do you think your fa
ther was? A. “He was, accord
ing to the synagogue, a Cohen
(priest).’*
Q. “Was he a Jew?” A. “He
was a Levite.”
Q. “What were you at birth?”
A. “At my birth I was a Hebrew
of /the Tiihe of Levi and a priest
after the Order of Aaron.”
Q. “Will you try to differentiate
to me the difference between a He
brew and a Jew?” A. “A -Jew is
a descendant of the Tribe of Judah,
one of the twelve sons of Jacob. A
Hebrew hr a person who is a descend-
ant of Abraham who was a Gentile.”
Q. “What-is a Christian?” A.
“A Christian is a follower and wor
shiper of Jesus Christ the Son of
God.”
His Terrific Battle
The hearing wore on. More than
500 typewritten pages are filled with
examination and cross-examination.
In addressing the court ,in the boy’s
behalf, Attorney Edwin Welling
Cady said, among other things: “The
boy has already chosen his own re-,
ligion. We daim he had a right to
do that. . . . There was constant
interference with his exercise of his
religious education, and then there
were the Children’s Court proceed
ings. ... A blot is placed against
his name without any -real offense.
. . . Jt is not a case of the court
having to decide the merits of two
different religious. ... On the
one hand there is the question of the
boy going to the House of Refuge.
That seems a sad thing, in view of
the possibilities of the boy and his
abilities. And on the other band
is protection,'' there is opportunity,
there is a way for him to achieve his
call.”
Prison—Weeping—Release
The protection referred to was
the offer of Rev. Dr.'Holloway to
stand as the boy’s guardian. - *
On June 27, 1922, the Surrogate
closed the case, saying: “I will re
serve decision.” His decision was a
refusal £p appoint a guardian for
the boy, and thus the case went
back to the Children’s Court. Judge
Wilkins of the latter court, sent the
young prisoner to Randall’s Island,
the penal institutio nfor incorrigible
children, for an indefinite term. The
attorney for the “Jewish Big Broth
ers’ Association” actually said,
“Trank you,” to the judge -upon pro
nouncement of sentence.
The boy, thus sentenced, knelt in
the corridor of the court room and
prayed, for his mother. When the
prison officials marked his clothes
with his prison number, he wept.
Yet . his conduct was so exemplary
that he won the esteem of Col. Bar
ber, the superintendent, and the re
spect of the inmates.
For six months this boy-remained
in prison. But the case - was too
flagrantly one of religious persecu
tion, and presently an influential
person was interested whose • inter
cession procured the boy’s release.
Harry Bucalstein is now studying to
be a missionary to those people
among whom he was reared.
The case, while not without par
allel, shows'what is possible for or
ganized groups to achieve in the
United States.-

Resolution to Investigate Shipping
Board to Be Presented In
Next Cnogress
—K-K-K
Washington.—A congressional in
quiry into the administration of the
shipping board under the chairman
ship of Albert L. Lasker is being
planned, Erwin L. Davis (Dem.), a
representative from Tennessee and a
member of the merchant marine com
mittee, announced that he would in
troduce a resolution in Congress pro
viding for an investigation; it is plan
ned to file a similar resolution in the
Senate.
Mr. Davis said that he was in pos
session of information indicating in
efficiency and waste during the Las
ker regime, and he said that the rev
elations of such an inquiry would
rival those of the Veterans’ Bureau.
The report on the Veterans’ Bureau
investigation is now being prepared
by the Senate committee which is
making the inquiry, and it is- planned
to file the report in Congress by De
cember 15.
Enough Votes Pledged
That enough votes have been
pledged to pass resolutions for a re
view of the shipping board affairs
was the statement of Mr. Davis, and
only sidetracking of the resolution
in committee would prevent the ex-
amination going through, he believed.
Members of Congress having the in
vestigation bee in their bonnets are
also talking about an inquiry into
the office of the alien property cus
todian. And certain senators are in
favor of continuing the investigation
of the Veterans’ Bureau next year.
It is assumed by the Davis group
that President Coolidge is not op
posed to an investigation of the Las
ker regime, and that the administra
tion wiU not attempt to check it. Mr.
Lasker is regarded as chief sponsor
of the presidential doom of Hiram
Johnson (Rep.), senator from Cali
fornia, and for that reason the im
pression of the investigation group is
that the supporters of President Cool
idge would be gl&d to see Mr. Lasker
“on the carpet,”
THE DDUBLEVISION: YESTERDAY
AND TOMORROW.
Far away upon thw dim and dis
tant rim of a crimson world, a Sun
day sun broke blood-red through the
deepening haze of 'low-hanging
clouds, wafted from blood-drenched
fields of human slaughter. '
Strange shaped objects crossed
rapidly inr the murky light of early
dawn, sailing away in opposite di
rections, then descending rapidly to
earth. Their fall ever marked by
huge upheavals of earth, mixed free
ly with objects, strangely resembling
human Hmbs and hands.
Weird cries echoed through the din
of deafening' noise, as indistinct,
shadowy forms floated upward in an
endless train, to vanish in the mys
terious sphere of God's world, there
to register beneath the millions gone
before. Victims of human lust for
power.
Smiles, froze in death on faces that
a moment before were beaming with
thoughts of home and mother. In
fancy they were again kneeling at
her dear feet, receiving the soft touch
that none but a mother can give.
Hearing Words of love that no one
but she ever speaks.
Louder grew the wild nhriek of
shot and shell as more numerous flew
those things heavenward. Out across
the "open fields charged t*he boys who
only yesterday were children around
a happy mother’s knee. A cheery
farewell he had waved toiler as the
train sped on eastward, pouring its
human flood into the grist mill of in
satiable war.
But that was yesterday. Today the
air is thick with screanfing engines
of destruction as bullet after bullet
finds it human mark, while over tJje
fallen comrade rushes the endless
and irresistible wave that no human
barrier can stop.
The long hours before noon drag
slowly by, yet there is no pause for
the demon of destruction—no let-up
in the grim reaping of human souls.
The noon hour passes and the sun
light, a gift of God to brighten the
paths of peace, grows dim as it turns
in horror, fleeing adown the Western
sky, eager to hide its face from the
bloody Western world. Yet there is
no escape, for the heathen land of
the far East, the wild jungles of the
dark continent and the boasted abode
of culture and civilization echo alike
to the cry of passing souls, torn
asunder by the heel of war.
Truly the world is a devouring
flame that feeds on the flesh of man
and God lias drawn the curtain of
divinity before the torch of human
madness.
On into the night goes the blindly
shrieking shell as the worn and weary
soldier staggers ever forward to find
no rest, but a grave.
The passing months have dragged
through in sleepless nights. The
gates of heaven ring loud from the
echo of millions of prayers out of the
hearts of womanhood. All the ten
derness of their reaches out to the
unseen God for that boy who means
more than life to her. .
Night comes at Hast upon the
Western front and a million hearts
breathe again that nightly prayer ere
they sink into a restless slumber.
Two million eyes gaze at their starry
flags and whisper, “God keep him?*
A golden halo encircles other thou
sands as they kneel in prayer for
that boy who sleeps the eternal sleep,
among the lilies of France. Was it
an "echo of other mothers who mur
mured the same prayer more than a
century ago, as the American infant
was struggling to loose the grip of a
tyrant’s hand and her fait call
reached a noble response from the
shores of far away France? Yes,
France, and American mothers not
American gold has paid that debt
and paid it welL
Slumber steal away the tired senses
and only sighs torn from saddened
hearts, break the stillness of the
night. Midnight passes slowly into
the making of another day. The
faint rays of the distant sun paint
the Eastern sky as the dreamer
starts wildly from her bed.
What is that awful noise, is it the
cry of the millions dead, clamoring
for entrance at heaven’s gate ? No,
listen; can’t you hear the glad note
in that siren’s piercing call? No
fear throttles that clear echo as it
splits asunder the chill November
air. Answer after answer raps that
twilight through and no doubt lin
gers now—lT IS PEACE—VICTORY
AT LAST. Nothing efce could put
such human feeling into that wild
din.
Smiles come again to pale faces
grown old with sadness. Mothers
fondly caress the sleeping forms t<r
catch the faint whisper of “Daddy.”
Others, young in girlhood, tenderly
press to throbbing hearts, the pic
ture of a soldier boy as a crimson
glow' touches the fair face at
thoughts of home and motherhood.
Far away among the fields .of
Dixie, down the old path that leads
to yonder cotton field, slovdy moves
the bent form of an old man. He
ealls back only a few years and sees
running gaily ahead, the boy, hi*
boy of only yesterday. But the lone
star in the flag that waves from his
window has turned from blue to gold.
Bent now and aged is that once proud
-form of a proud race. White the
locks once raven black, yet no braver

heart ever beat in hnman breast and
no murmur of protest passes those
firm set lips. Duty called and he
gave his all. life’s race was almost
run but no son remained to carry on.
So much for the outward man, yet
in the hidden, guarded soul, there
burns a terrible fire of loneliness that
pride of gifts of man cannot soften.
His life struggle for are boy brought
no happiness to the failing footsteps
of advancing age. The end was here,
when it should only be the beginning.
God pity those homes!
That Sunday has passed from the
calendar of time. Peace has dawned
once again. The blood lu«t of maa is
passing away. A strange quiet
reigns where only yesterday souls
were rent asunder by the thousands.
The last cold form has been moved
from the gloom of the battlefield.
Nothing'breaks the silence of the
long night, save the miracle of the
lone night-bird sighing for its lost
mate.
Yes, beautiful peace has come and
mrfn will fight no more. Proud and
happy are the world’s millions yet
untouched by the grim reaper *of •
death. But how about that lone old
man in the South? There are thou
sands like him. Those heralds of a
world peace have qot silenced the still
small voice calling from the graves
of France, to mothers that do not
come. She would have given her life
to have cooled the fevered brow of
her boy as he sank to sleep uot there.
God demands pay for the crimes of
men, but men do not pay. It’s moth
erhood that has paid through the end
less centuries since the dawn of time.
It’s motherhood that will always pay.
God grant that the last evil of na
tions lies buried on the banks of the
Rhine. That the coming years wit
ness the union of continents in build
ing a shrine of peace that no earthly
power dare shake. - That the broken
hearts of worlds may heal, to wound
no more.
1 Years have sped by since those
memorable days.
The legions of despotic ruler have
vanished like chaff before the wind,
yet the peace we fought for remains
shadowed by another monster shape
that would drive his hateful creed
over our fair land even at the point
of the sword.
We deny no man his religion and
we will never stand to have his
forced. upon us.
This is a country by Americans,
for Americans and of Americans and
no influence of a foreign nature,
whether of so-called religion or other
wise, shall ever dominate our land.
We seek and will have liberty, no
matter the cost.
Men and women of those bitter
days, let’s make this country our
country, denying no home to the
alien, yet swing high the banner of
pure Americanism that- no shadow
may ever darken our fair homes. It
is our Hand and we stand only for its
preservation. Is that wrong? Do
you stand for less or could you stand
for more?
A hundred million prayers braced
our boys over there. Let the same
host send a prayer to God above,
that the cooing dove of peace may
reach our minds and hearts. That
released, he may soar high above the
troubled world, singing his song of
“Peace on earth, 'good will to men.”
That he may alight atop this loved
nation of ours and as he folds his
his wings, encircle the universe be
neath the God-given emblem, and
peace, glorious peace never grow
dim under God’s heaven.
God give us America for Ameri

LINES FROM A FRIEND’S HOUSE
God bless this house and all within it.
Let no harsh spirit enter in it,
Let none approach who would betray,
None with a bitter word to say.
Shield it from harm and sorrow’s
sting,
Here let the children’s, laughter ring,
Grant that these friends from year
to year
Shall build their happiest memories
here.
God bless this house and those who
love it,
Fair be the skies, which bend above
it.
May never anger’s thoughtless word
Within these shetltering walls be
heard,
May all who test beside this fire
And then depart, glad thoughts in
spire,
And make them feel who dose the
door,
Friendship has graced their home
once more.
God bless this house and those who
keep it.
In the sweet oil of gladness steep it,
Endow - these walls with lasting
wealth,
The light of love, the glow of health,
the palm of peace, the charm of
mirth,
Good friends to sit around the
hearth,
And with each nightfall perfect rest—
Here let them live their happiest.
