LETTERS TEO El THE PEOPLE
SOME INTERESTING HISTORY.
Columbia, Mo., Nov. 1. 1907.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson. Thomson, Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson: Our committee
on the cbautauqua program. are anx
ious to have you with us on the af
ternoon of August 15, 1908. We
know it would be impossible for you
to promise positively that you could
come, but I am so anxious for an
opportunity to hear you that I am
going to urge you to make ns a price
for the above date. I was an alter
nate delegate to the St. Louis con
vention that nominated Bryan and
Watson. I must tell you what Cy
clone Davis told me at the St. James
hotel, after the convention was over.
I asked him what about this mix-up
and he said Sewell would bo taken
off, and all the opposition in the world
couldn't beat Bryan and Watson. I
asked, “What assurance have you?”
and he said there was a positive agree
ment to that effect. But for Marion
Butler, I believe this agreement would
have been carried out. The word
“Benedict” applied to both parties
to the agreement tells the whole
story. I agree with your magazine
on Bryan, while I have never fullv
forgiven him for not standing’ by you
in 1896. I believe he is the only man
before the American people today
that the reform forces could get to
gether on. and at least give us a
change. I think, as you say. it would
drive the plutocrats to run Mr. Roose
velt for a third term. With a divis
ion in his party on the tariff, a third
term handicap, his vacillating stand
on the trusts and the railroad ques
tion. his failure to use the strong arm
of the government to stop this bank
ers’ panic: with this load to carry
1 believe Bryan would bo the victor.
Hoping you will comply with the
above request, I am,
Faithfully yours,
J. B. COLE.
Pres. Columbia Chautauqua Assn.
(I was elected first alternate at
the St. Joseph, Mo.. Convention. One
of the delegates was not present.
The second alternate, Editor Frank
Griffin, of Maryville, Mo., got there
first and got the place, then offered
it to me, but 1 preferred to be free
so I could attend the Silver Conven
tion at intervals. 1 was so anxious to
know what the Georgia delegation was
doing that t boldly walked into the
room on the occasion that Judges
ITines —T think it was Hines —an-
nounced your decision, or at least, he
gave the assurance that you would
accept the nomination. So you see
it would be misleading to say I was
a delegate without the above expla
nation.)
POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
Washington, D. C., Oct. 17, 1907.
The following letter was received
today by the Postmaster-General:
“Boston. Mass., Oct. 15. 1907.
“66 Wellington Hill St.
■‘Postmaster-General George von L.
.Moyer. Washington, D. C.
“Dear Sir: [ had the pleasure of
hearing your address last Saturday
evening at American House, Boston,
on the proposed parcels post measure
you will recommend to Congress.
“What I think of your address is
WATSOJCS WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
partly shown from interview in Bos
ton Herald (see clipping enclosed).
From being your extreme opponent, I
am now your strongest possible sup
porter. While prophecy is danger
ous, I predict every State association
in New England of Retail Merchants
will reconsider their votes of oppo
sition, and all vote their approval.
As I understood your remarks, the
railroads are to have nothing to do
with transporting any merchandise,
11 pounds for 25 cents. That will
only apply to rural routes.
“Respectfully,
“(Signed) ELISHA WINTER.”
The following is the interview re
ferred to, from the Boston Herald:
“Country merchants all over New
England rejoiced yesterday, following
diffusion of the reports of Postmaster-
General Meyer’s speech in Boston
Saturday, which, they say, gives them
their first recognition at the hands of
government officials.
“ ‘The only opposition to such a
proposal as that made by Mr. Meyer,’
said New E*gland Organizer Elisha
Winter, of the National Association
of Retail Merchants to a reporter
for The Herald, ‘will come from such
houses as seek to put fraudulent
goods before the public, against which
we have been fighting.’
“ ‘I have been visiting conventions
in various parts of New England for
a year past, and I am in close touch
with the rural sentiment. There has
never yet been a parcels post bill
which the farmers have endorsed.
Heretofore such bills as have been
presented have benefited the catalog
houses to a discouraging degree. But
houses to a discouraging degree.’ But
a bill along the lines suggested by
Mr. Meyer’s address will not only
meet every objection we have had to
previous bills, but will, moreover, give
us more than we would have dared to
ask for.
“ ‘Mr. Meyer gives us recognition
for the first time to an extent w’e had
never expected, and his proposal will
benefit every one in this country ex
cept fakirs and frauds.
“ ‘We now have the Aubuehon
bill, which is being introduced in the
Missouri legislature. That bill pro
vides for the compulsion of honest
advertising, and when it is passed it
will prevent the sending out of cata
logs of fraudulent houses.
“ ‘The idea as set forth by Mr.
Meyer meets with praise everywhere
among the farmers and merchants.’ ”
Editor Georgian:
Through your colums, as a citizen
of Georgia, and a subscriber to your
paper, I claim the right to be heard
on Ihe Scab Wright-Joe Hill Hall
scene that occurred in the Georgia
legislature last Wednesday. As to
cheering and applauding, the people
have a right to do so, and they are
doing it now all over the State.
Chairman Slaton, nor any one else,
can stop them. From the bottom of
my heart, I cheer, Rah for Seab
Wright and prohibition I By what
right do the minority claim to usurp
the people’s time and money and
block righteous legislation and choke
the voice of the people? Joe Hill Hall
cried that Seab Wright was respon-
sible for the outburst in the galleries,
and the people say that the minority,
filibustering, led by Joe Hill Hall, is
responsible. Joe Hill Hall claims
that Seab Wright struck him. The
people claim that it was his old
mother Georgia who struck him. And
it is something uncommon or without
precedent for a wayward, disobedient
boy to claim damages of a mother
who spanked him in the interest and
for the good of the whole family.
The people believe Mr. Hall, if he had
been tantalized himself, as he and
others tantalized Mr. Wright and the
people, that he (Hall) would have
struck before Wright did. The mi
nority, or filibusters, or liquor dealers,
claim that Seab Wright’s great sin
lay in calling Joe Hill Hall a liar.
Now, if it was the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, that
Mr. Wright, whom the people elected
and seated, was unworthy, in that
case Mr. Hall spoke true. But on
the other hand, if Seab Wright is
worthy, as a big majority of the peo
ple believe, why, then, the people be
lieve that Joe Hall is too big to hold
Scab Wright responsible, because at
the moment he was not able to think
up a big word like prevaricator, or
something else. Now. what the peo
ple want to know is. Whether the
money of the whiskey men, or the
whiskey of the money men, is bolster
ing the filibustering in the Georgia
legislature, and working together on
the Wall street theory of “the peo
ple be d —”!
Just here may not be the place to
say it, but the people of Georgia
know that the same elements that
are backing up the above legislative
filibustering are the same gang that
backed up the counting out of Tom
Watson and Judge Hines, and always
stand ready-cocked and primed to
make an effort to defeat the will of
the people. Is there really an im
passable chasm between the people
and greed? Will the people never
be able to enact laws for their bene
fit and preservation without greed
trying to block them by filibustering
and injunctions? Must we always
live under a government whose laws
are made by filibustering and set aside
by injunctions? God forbid.
J. B. HOWARD.

P. S. —When monopolistic greed
wants a law they claim it in the in
terest of the dear people. When the
people want a law they say it will
ruin the country, and forthwith hire
judges to annul it by injunction. I
know I am not able to set the thoughts
of <>ur people before the public in
rounded, smooth sentences like Mr.
Seely or Editor Graves would, but I
have a knack of expressing myself
freely, honestly and fearlessly, which
1 hope you will appreciate enough to
publish the above at once. If you
find it too plain and refuse to publish
it. please send back to me at my ex
pense. Address Morristown, Ga.

A SUCCESSFUL PUNCH.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: You kind o’ punched me
last week with that card, and here is
the result: Find enclosed check to
pay for the following names for the
Weekly Jeffersonian and monthly
magazine.

FROM A GEORGIAN WHO
WEST. I •
Connerville, I- T., Nom
Hon. Thos. E. A
My Dear received,
and will me more pleas
ure any other man in the
United States.
Tn regard to my new home, I can
say I am highly pleased with the
West. I have settled in the Chicka
saw nation near the capital, which is
Tishomingo, on Blue river. So you
have some idea as to the land I have
for farming on.
I had the pleasure of being at the
first election that was ever held here,
and I thought to myself, If all the
elections that were ever held in Geor
gia had been carried on like this,
things would have gone quite different
to what they did about the time you
and Judge Hines were making your
race.
Tn regard to the “ Jeffersonian,” I
certainly can’t afford to be without
it. I started out with the People’s
Party Paper, and I am still sticking.
I have already been reading and
talking up the magazine to some of
my friends, and believe when I get
a little farther through with my gath
ering I will be able to get you a very
nice list of subscriptions, and will now
enclose a few names for you. But
before I go any further, I want to
mention to you that I haye failed to
get about three of my magazines, and
have only gotten about three of the
Jeffersonians this year. I thought it
best to mention it, as I didn’t know
where the trouble was.
With best wishes to the Jefferson
ian always, I remain,
Your true friend,
THOMAS C. BOWERS.
Russell, Ark., Nov. 4, 1907.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Find enclosed P. O. order
for sl, for which you will please re
new my subscription to The Weekly
Jeffersonian. Your paper stands at
the head of the list with me.
Yours for justice,
