The Daily Times-DIernocert of
hInist Saturdayv gives an accoLunt of
Mr. C. D. Puckett'-'s report to the
,,.. Suwtr-planters of his efforts to
havelse the Pol:lit ate convention
indor-se thile Republican ticket.
We have char' ed Ithat Mr. Booth
wr. as in collu.dsion with Mr. Puckett:
to accomiplish that end, and we
so gave last week some evidences of
'" it.picked uplin the convention by
delegatcs. Now we wish to zive
some evidence from the other sid(e.
In this report to his pcople, Mr.
Puckette narrates the principal
events of our convention "at Alex
A e: l-andria, and speaking of Capt.
' P:arr': declination, says :
"This brought about still fur
t ther demloralization, and as the
dr" delegates had become entirely un
nom controllable, so far as effecting a
fusion was concerned, he was coln
pI):lcld to do the next best thing,
a be which was to have Booth secure
the nomination himself, with the
"b understanding that a resolution
was to be adopted empowering the
,1: Executive Committee to fill vacan
" cies occasioned by resignation or
Mt failure to nominate; he (Booth) to
come down from the head of the
tickt and accept second place at
the proper time, and thus make
the fusion scheme possible by means
of a ticket that the Executive Com
mittee would place in the tiell."
1A' Now, we have Mr. Booth's word
to such men as Howell, McFarland,
Benoit and Gamble, that it was his
purpose to resign in favor of the
Sugar-planter, and the above state
ment from Mr. Pucketto that he t
had Booth to secure the nomina
tion in the interest of the Sugar
planter ticket, thus completing the
chain of evidence, which ought to I
satisfy the most skeptical that Mr. c
Booth has acted in bad faith with f
our party, and is by no meats a
suitable man for the head of our
ticket. n
All good Populists should at t
once demand Mr. Booth's resigns- "
tion from the ticket, and join their
State Central Committee in making E
a ticket that will, at least command li
"'the respect and earnest support of 0
the party. P
y The convention at Alexandria
n would have done this, if Booth's v
*e treachery had been discovered ear- C
lier, but the time for adjournment it
g had already come, the delegates c(
s were inorn out and exhausted by n
(i the dilatory tactics which had beeoon
e pursued by Booth, so that they hi
did well to catch the traitor before 1
o he had delivered them, as was his f
e purpoeo, at that meeting to the
- Sugar-planters. The convention ec
was victorious, however, and made gi
r due preparations .to have its de- c
tested enemies runally disposed of. ec

x- We. the Grand Jury emupannel
It. ed at the reptular lhece,';Ih'"r Tertm
of your lion. C'olrt, I""g leave to
make this our final report:
Wr- We have been in session three
ho week:;, an have' not e"ntirely clear
n . ed the dlocket, on 'ac'colunt of the
' a itmmnense amount of business that
n has been brought to our attention,
tt, c:ucsed by the failure to hold the
ire regular sumImer t:'rm.
:he have examined into four
on hundred an:l nineteen cases, and
he rturnedl one hundred and sixty
'i- threr*True bills, mostly for minor
or offens:s, andl have passed some
thing like fifty cases for the next
he Grand .Iury.
at \e have visited the Parish Jail,
ke and tind it well kept, and in a san
itary condition, with very little I
cot mplaint from the prisoners con
fined therein of the quantity of
,rd food furnished them, but find that
d, the kind was good and wholesome.
iH We have gone through the various
parish offices, Sheriff, 'Treasurer,
h&e., and find them ill right, well
te- kept, and said officers attentive to a
he their duties. t
- We think it very unfortunate
that the regular June term of your t
r Hon. Court was postponed entire- C
he ly, and would recommend that it s
to be not repeated, as it tends to ac- t
r. cumulate such an immense amount t
th of business that it is imlosible t
for the Grand Jury to dispatch I
same in any reasonable length of g
ir time, and therefore, we have not s
had the time to give the Institu- t
at tions of the parish the attention we ii
a would have liked.
ir As to the crimes in the parish, a
we find that the one of carrying
I1 concealed weapons the most pro. J
id lific, and as the cause of the most e
>f of the disturbances of the public to
peace, and would recommend that ti
the ooodx citizens of this parish c
i stand together, present all these ii
a violations of the law to future t(
r- Grand Juries, and that the Court d,
it impose heavy fines on all parties s(
cor.viittdl of same. ci
We are also sorry to have to
Y report that we find a great many
a communities in our parish that
v have been troubled with distur
e bances of the public peace, such as
running horses and discharg"ing
firearms, profane and obscene lan
e guage on the public highways, al
, so at various churches and other I
e gatherings. We find this to be the p
case particularly in wards four, ti
seven and ten. We have l.ven the
crime of selling liquor without li
cense our special attention, an M
find very few infractions of the
law, and a disposition amon the th
merchafIts and druggists to abide
thereby to the letter; but we
would further state that there are na
certain concoctions disposed of "
over the counters of some business s
houses in the Town of Natchito- ha
ches, which contain entirely too
much Alcohol to be sold in a pro
hibition parish, and would reconm
mend that the vendors thereof de- go
gist. In thin connection, we would of
name one, viz: "Rye and Rock to
Balsam," which, according to the
formula on the bottle contamns over
75 per cent of whiskey. of
Another matter which this Grand on
Jury hea seen proper to take cog- M
nismoe of is the manner in which
some of the Magistrates' Courts w
are conducted. There is an ordi
nance of the Police Jury which
prohibits a Magiastrate from going noi
out of his ward to take husinees, D.
yet we find this had been done in w
some instances, and would recom-i
mend that the Ion. Pohee Jury his
refuse to honor any accounts pre
meted uader these circumstances, it,
iand thereby rave the parish un- at(
necesr .ese. Agai, some u
ci te  tea throughout the
perish have a disposition to eater
tain all kiada of travoloua charges me
and counter charges, which amount he
to nmothing on their face, have no par
ding in s investitation, yetret

quarters in a gco(x sanitary condi
tion.
We further find that the public
roads throughout the parish are not
of in as good cn ititi n that they night
urt be, and would reeontunend that the
oversers thereof he a little more
ast- zealous in the discharge of their
duties. We are well awatrre of the
fact, that considlering the setason
Th1- of the year. all public highways
'rm are necessarily mIddy. but there
to are sotme )laces i iii )me sections
that colold ,e very much imlproved,
ree ant would caution twhese overscers
' r-to see after thnm art oo,,e, and save
the trouble, before the, next Grand Jiu
hat ry. We refer l):rticularly to some
on, roads ii war. s one an I ten.
the We trust that we may have a
season of proslermty, and with a
uor P'rohibiti,.n law well enforced, a
nd decrase in crime of all kinds
ty- throughout the parish.
or There is a certain abuse of the
ne- public ferries throughout the par
ent ish, hic.h we think demands the
attention of our Police Jury. It
til, is commonn in some places for par
un- ties living near a public ferry to *
tle keep a boat which the public is al
)n- lowed to use without charge, to the
of serious detrinment of the ferryman,
hat who leases his ferry, and gives a
1C-. lsm,nl for the faithful performance
t1u of certain duti 's. We call the at
er, tention of the Police Jury to this
ell matter, and recommend that they
to adjust matters for the better pro
tection of said ferrymen.
tte We have given some attention to
aur the affairs of the School Board, and
- our investiatiion justifies us in
it saying the financial condition of
mc- the public schools is quite healthy,
nt there being some $01t3 48 in its
,le treasury to the credit of the School
ch Fund, with an apportionment of
of $260 from the State, to be received
tot soon. We regret to say however,
;u- the public do mnt take the interest "
we in the school affairs of the parish
we think the importance of the
h, same requires.
ug Tendering our thanks as a Grand t
o- Jury to the Court for courtesies tI
st extended, to our able District At- tr
lic torney for his counsel and atten- Pi
at tion, to our worthy Sheriff and et

SEd. Populist :-The executive 1
committee and mass meeting of our tas
r party in ward 3, has ordered a i
primary election on Saturday, Feb, c
1st, to nominate a Police Juror for wi
this ward. s
Red river divides our ward, and tot
the East side has the nominees for
Magistrate and Constable, and the
e thirty good Populists who have in
e dormed me for Police Juror think
that the West side is entitled to
name the Police Juror, and are
Sasking that I be selected, but I
a suppose there are others who per
haps do not agree with us.
Respectfully
L. R. B URNSIDE.
S We know that ward 3 has many
Igood Populists capable and worthy
I of the office, but we would be glad
to see Mr. Burnslde selected, if it
Sis agreeable, as then each section pai
of the ward would be repreeented nol
I on the ward ticket, and we believe
- Mr. Burnmeide would make his
Sward an excellent Police Juror.
One ot our energetic, bustling P1
nominees for State Senator, Mr.
D. G. Freeman, of Red River,
was in our ofiee last Friday.
He intended to go from here to
his childhood home for a short vis- D
it, and to address his old friends
at College Hill, in Grant, and At- OF
lanta, in Winn, this week,.but on m
hearing of the State committeeD
meeting at Alexandria, Thursday, a
he straightway put the good of his
party before his own pleasure and
returned home, to prepare to at
toend said ineeting.
IDave knows no such word as the
"fail," and is as patriotic as Pat- and
rick Heary, and fully competent o
to handle any opposition yet sent of L
before him, from Att'y. Gen. down. uo
