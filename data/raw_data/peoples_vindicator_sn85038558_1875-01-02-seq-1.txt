The.head of the ao-talled D)epart.
mment of Justice is inspired, and be
comes prophetic,
His horoscope for the Democratic
party is a gloomy one. Elated by an
overwhelming stccess,' and lunatic in
victory, it 'is to rush widly into ex
tremes of reaction, and madly revive
old issuesewhich are beyond the resur.
rection of pre-Adamite B~ir'bonism.
It is to be feared that the Attorney
General has a glamour of vision both
of the liting preseint and the coming
future. Far.beit fromnt our intention
to traverse his right to speak of the
past or progniosticate what is to come
in the progrtg of his anpient ftie.dle,
flelaias an fi6eitediuthoLitthity t"'o ex
press impreasions which natural sym
pathy and:ong association have left
upon his retmembraluce. The.e eror he
commits is this, 'if lie is' not aiove all
lapltesitfjjudgmelnt in' Fpolitics as in:
law, that the Democraticparty now
is what it was when he cunbered 'its
organization and . clamored. for its.
bread. . He forgets that' in the general
purgation which it has undergoni' it.
his apostacy, add: the like of him,
,newer life has been revived. U-nhap
pily for the Republicans; the gain of
the old party was a ruii to them, and
the only impending dangerto the pn
rified'Democracy is the return of such
recreants as he, when the savory vi
ands again smoke on their platter.
He belonged to the lowest of the
low grade of levellers and agrarians
in his juvenility, standing not on the
groan4 floor,. btpon,:the mud sill, and
taking its 'most. menial service. No
'hungry adventurer could taunt 'a
Whig or'an Abolitionist with a greit'
or unction of: hatred, t' maglign.'a
"nigger"twith-A bitterer intensity of
scorn. By a fortuitous accident elect,
ed a Judge ii a, judicial district" of
Iowa,' then just out ·of her 'waddling
clothes. of; territorial wardship, he
carried after the expiration of his
term his limited stock. of law to the
wilderness of Oregon, where' re dis
pensed such leg4i lore, as has never
been kndwn out of the' moot conita
of law schools or the jurisdiction of
Judge Lynch.
In tlte mean time the war of the
rebellion brought with its sad. por
tenth for the fortunes of the party:
The Democratic glebe was arid and
the green pasturage scant and shrunk.
en. After cursing the. Abtolitionist,
for a year, with a prospect of very
irregular visitations of the pay-'ast
ter,ile became patriotic and intensely'
anxious for the Union and its integrity
the colqred brethren, and incidental
ly for a seat in the Senate soon to be
vacant. With the keen nostrils of the
slouth hound, scenting disaster, bank
raptcy; and liquidation of the 'old
party, he packed hid slender, stoak of
principles, and not embarrassed by
the ownership' of ny a isti
mentality 'aseotiseienee, move`: iktif
the Repibblican party and'the United
Statepe enate. ,, Singe then,he has, be
come national, and is not likely to
go out of our history in lifi ignominy.

ºlow GooD STOCK PAs.--A cor
respondent' of the Dixie Farmer says:
1 will give a recent occurrence or twu
Sthat hals dollars. and cents in it. A
Kientucky breeder. recently offered a
live proposition to a neighbor of mine
I -$5 for all the calves on his place
I fr rh 'wining to twenty m.onthºs old
--he declined the offer. On the ad
joining.farms he could have bought
calves .of the same age at front $2 to
$6 per head. lie said he would not
drive theni to Kentucky if they were
presented to him. Why t The im
proved breed of calves coui be nmade
lo gross 1,700 Ibs: at three years old;
the ojltrs, if yvr, t ve or si )year.;
one conuizitin g as miuch grass and re
quiring the same care as the other.
Commintt is tunnecessery. I sldd last
fall, at the faitr at Murfreesboro, a
one-yt'ar-.uol filly for. $4tt) gleeu
backs; she was a thorough-bred, and
cost no iii$"te' raise her to that age
thian a mnongrel or a mule- the only
additional cost heing the first pro
duce. I refused $250 for her second
foal at five ntpntha old. I paid $25
for another mite"; 'sold her two-year.
and one-year old fillies. for $500. I
paid $1 15 for a fine jennet, in foal to
a tine jack, and sold at two and a
half years old for $2,000. All the,
well-bed ,pigs I an 'raise are in de
mand at ten dollars each, at from twoo
to three months old, All the improv
ed varieties of sheep pay-their lambs
selling from $10 to $25 at weaning
time. The improved breeds of poul
try pay. What is it that doit't'pay if
the best of its kind and, wfllcarrti
for t What mongrel stock does pay?
If any, I have to fnd it oat.

more and more strongly conlri ied in
the opinion that clover can be 'grown'
on almostianur land in. this country~
which is already fertile .enough to
produce a fair crop of corn. lBut if
we have worn out old fields to reno
vate, we cannot .begin with clover and
without manure. We. must plant
sgmething whjeh will thrive on a very,
poor soil. We have the right thing
in the'cow pea. We have heard of
land "too poor to. sprout cow peas,"
but we hamve not-had the misfortne to
own or occupy any such unpromising
acies. Wlieien we Iave grown and
turned i'inder : evin a light crop of
peas 'we have c€,mmeneed the work of
improvement.;, We can depend upon
a heavier crop at the next planting,
and in' the end, "with a prtPper rota
