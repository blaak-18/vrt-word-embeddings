Christ Alone Capable of Dealing With
All Ills of Mankind, Says Dr. Speer
(Published herewith Is « sermon
Dr. Ilnhert K. Speer of New York
City In which he outlines that Christ
alone Is able to deal with all the Ills
that confront the human world to*
day.)
In full loyalty to the words which,
with characteristic truth and sincer
ity, our dear and trusted friend has
just spoken, I want to ask you to lift
your eyes with still undiverted vision
from the church, and from ourselves,
and look out across our world today.
It is a world whose need is more ob
vious and more ominous/than it has
■ever been. Four particulars will suf
fice to justify that general statement.
First, the war patterns are being
etamped upon the minds and wills of
men today more subtly and powerful
ly than ever before. One would have
thought that it were enough that
more men should be under arms to
day than before the great war di
verting from industry those multi
tudes of men whose productive labor
is needed to restore the mad ravages
of these last 10 years. One would
think that it were enough that the
world was bearing today the heaviest
burdens that the shoulders of men
have been called to bear. Apparently
this is not enough, and powerful in
fluences are working more subtly in
the world than ever to make possible
again the horrors which we thought
we were going to put an end to for
* I was reading yesterday a declara
tion just issued by one of our nation
al organizations in which there was
vigorous advocacy of certain militar
istic arrangements in anticipation of
the future, and the appeal of this
document from this organization used
these words: “This is a plan in har
mony with the spirit of the present
hour and crisis of the nation, which
calls for trained men with guns in
their hands; but it also includes with
in its effective scope, provision for
safety against the menace of a peace
so long and prosperously continued
that the capacity of me nfor service
and sacrifice dies of disuse,” only to

be revived again by the glorious and
heroic opportunities for slaughter and
self-sacrifice in war. Such appeals
are put forth in the interest of tough
ening the fibre of the national char
acter, forgetting that war is the sur
est way to disintegrate the whole fab
ric of the race, that war kills off the
best sires of posterity and weakens
the very tissue and fibre of the hu
man stuff. We look out on a world
of more obvious and ominous need
than ever before, because the war
patterns are being stamped upon the
minds and souls of men more subtly
perhaps than in any other generation
that has gone bfore.
In the second place, the passion of
racial hatred and the warrant of race
exploitation are openly defended to
day with a skill and daring new even
o our generation. I was reading this
last week a new book that has just
been issued on “Race and National
Solidarity.” The author tramples
frankly and regretfully upon all
claims of humanitariansim and hu
man brotherhood, does it deliberately
and acknowledged ly, and sets up in
stead that the best interests of man
kind depend upon the assertion by
the white race of its high superior
ity and warrant its exploitation of
all the other races in order that they
may do the work of the white race,
and allow it leisure for its fullest de
velopment and artistic self-expres
sion. There is another book on J, The
Conflict of Color,” in which the au
thor anticipates that the white race
may some day lament that when it
had its hands on the throat of some
of the weaker races it did not settle
the issue once for all. leaving its do
minion undisputed. The need of the
world is more obvious and ominous
than ever, when serious groups of men
are preaching unblushingly the doc
trine of the absolutism of the white
race and sowing the seeds of inter
racial struggle and prejudice and
hate.
In the third place, never in our
generation or perhaps in any other,
has there been such deep inhumanity
of man to manas in this day in which
we are living now. Dr. Bible was
telling us this afternoon about the
Far East, and the price it is paying
for its introduction into the indus
trial fellowship of the modern world.
I was in Shanghai 30 years ago, be
fore these great cotton factories had
been built. I have seen them grow,
year by year, until you can shut your
eyes now in the streets along those
rows of cotton mills, and think you
are hearing the thunder of American
industry in Lowell or Lawrence or
Fall River. I have seen children busy
before the looms, feeding their lives
into the spindles, little boys and
girls, 8,9, and 10 years old, working
12 to 14 hours shifts in the cotton
factories and in the super-heated air
of the silk mills. In Christendom
many great forces flowing from Christ
have steadily ameliorated the lot of
mankind, but still in East and West
alike man is suffering for man, hu
man gain costing human loss and
pain. As much as ever we have to
mourn our inhumanity to ourselves.
And once again, this need, more ob
vious and ominous than in any other
day. springs out of the simple and
plain fact of human sin, not some
thing misty, nebulous, indefinable,
but the most real and practical thing
in the world, want of conformity to
and transgression of the plain law
of God, with regard to man himself,
and man’s relationship to man, and
the relationship of race to race, and
of nation to nation. Again I say that
as we look out over our modern
world, we see its deep need more ob
vious and ominous than ever.
And here as we gather in this con
ference, we are ready to lay down
beside this generalization another
generalization to cover it. We hold
the assured conviction that Jesus
Christ alone, is competent to deal
with all the need of the world. We
are not concerned here because out
side the Christian church there are
men who deny Christ’s adequacy to
meet human need. Our concern is
lest there should be any unbelief in
Christ’s efficiency for the world’s
need inside the bounds of those who
Erofessedly call Him their Master and
ord. I was reading, on my journey
here, an article in a paper edited by
an old friend, in which the writer
said that the efforts of governments
to end war were contrary to the will
of God, that it is not the duty of na
tions to try to drive war out of the
world, an dso the bring into the world
the warless day. I know what he was
thinking of. Hewas thinking that
war will never be done away with
among men until our Lord comes back
again. I myself believe, and I re
joice to bear my testimony, in the
literal personal return of our Lord
Jesus Christ to this earth again, and
every day I pray and watch for his
return. But I believe that our Lord
would rather come back to a world
from which war had been driven out,
where there was no longer the pas
sion of unbrotherly inter-racial hate,
where men did not exploit little
children and sacrifice the coming gen
erations to the greed and gain of to
day. I do not read my Gospel other
wise than that Jesus Christ set this
to be our aim. I do not find among
the Beatitudes, “Blessed are those
who make war, for they fulfill the
law of god.” But I do find there set
plain and clear, His word, “Blessed
are they that make peace, for they
shall be called the children of God.”
I know that He came to be the Sav
iour and not the loser of the world.
I know that He was lifted up, not to
repel men from Him, but to draw all
men unto Himself. And I know the
prayer which He taught His disciples,
which He never would have taught
them if it were a vain repitition of
WOMEN'S KLANS GROW
THROUGH MISSISSIPPI
Fifty-eight Chapters Already
Established in as Many
Places
JACKSON, MISS., March 10.—The
Women of the Ku Klux Klan in this
state is organizing rapidly, doing
fine work, and preparing for yet
more. There are now 58 Klans in as
many places, which are rapidly be
ing chartered, and provisional ones
being constantly formed. The Major
Kleagle of the state is greatly
pleased and encouraged over the
fine, loyal spirit of Mississippi’s wo
manhood, and it is hoped that the
time is not far distant when Missis
sippi will be organized as a Realm,
with its own state headquarters, and
state head.
words, which He must have believed
some day by His grace it would be
their joy to effect, was a prayer that
His kingdom might come and His will
be done upon this earth even as it
is in heaven.
Some o fyou have heard, during the
last two years, that earnest group of
singers from Fisk University, and I
am sure that if you have one song of
theirs clings most tenaciously to your
memory. It was a simple old repe
titious negro melody, that, child-like
they sang over again and again:
“Lord, bless de hungry children, in
dis world, in dis world.
Lord, bless de widows and de orphans,
in dis world, in dis world.
Lord, bless de struggle for freedom,
in dis world, in dis world.
Lord, bless de armies or de righteous,
in dis world, in dis world.”
We long together for the distant
isles of the blest, and the peace of
the land beyond the evening’s hor
zon line, but our Lord bade us seek
to build on this earth the kingdom of
His Father, that should be righteous
ness, and peace and joy of the Holy
Ghost, to set it up even today among
men. And over against a dark war
patterned world, filled with the pas
sions of inter-racial hatred, with the
inhumanity of man toward man, and
worse, of man toward the little ones
of Christ, you and I believe in the
possibility of such a kingdom, in an
adequate and efficient Saviour, in a
Lord able and alone able to meet the
need of the whole world. A dear old
Quaker sent me some time ago a
little bit of John Oxenham’s verse:
“Only through Me! —The clear, high
call comes pealing
Above the thunders of the battel
plain;—
Only through Me can life’s red
woun find healing;
Only through Me shall earth have
peace again.
“Only through Me! Love’s might, all
might transcending.
Alone can draw the poison fangs
of hate.
Yours the beginning! Mine a nobler
ending
Peace upon earth and man regen
erate.
“Only through Me can come the great
awakening!
Wrong cannot right the wrongs that
Wrong hath done;
Only through Me, all other gods for
saking.
Can ye attain the heights that must
be won.
"Can we not rise to such great height
of glory?
Shall this vast sorrow spend itself
in vain?
Shall future ages tell the woeful
Story—
Christ by His own was crucified
again?”
Or shal lthe future tell the other
story, that now at last in our day a
generation rose and saw with clearer
eyes the blac kand awful darkness of
the world, and that knew with richer
faith than ever the sufficiency of Je
sus Christ to save the world.
If these two things of which I
have been speaking are true, is not
the third as clear as day, that what
ever else may concern our lives, one
supreme duty must control them, the
duty of bearing Christ out to meet
the needs of our present world? I
know that other ideals than this are
finding their way again across the
thought of our nation. I could quote
for you, if it were prudent to do so,
four great speeches made within the
last two weeks by four of the most
conspicuous personalities o fthis na
tion, in every one of which the ideal
of unselfish duty is ignored, and the
idea of self-interest set up in its
place. We are counseled that our
policy must not be controlled by ab
stractions and vague ideals but by
the Interest of our economic life,
well, there will come a day when It
will be discovered that those who sub
ordinate duty to interest sacrificed
both duty and interest alike. As God
is just, the men who do their full
duty are the men in whose hands the
interests of time and eternity lie.
and we need not hesitate for one mo
ment to face the whole unselfish task
that we confront in the world because
of any fear that in living by the prin
ciple of the brotherhood of all mefl
we are going to imperil any just in
terest of ours. The surest way for
the white race to bring about its
doom is to forget that God has made
of one blood al lthe nations of men.
We have one God and Father over
us all, and one great family on the
earth, of whom the one Father in
heaven is the Head. Over against a
world of need, with a sufficient Christ
in our possession, the plain obliga
tion to share our Lord with al lthe
world is the clearest fact in our lives.
I go on to say those things which
for a moment I was tempted to say
alone tnight, that we have now to
day, in this gathering certain clear
and concrete tasks laid upon us to
do, by doing which we may show that
such thoughts as these of which I
have spoken are not mere pious gen
eralities and hopes, but realities by
which we shall actually bring Christ
to bear on all the need of the human
life of the world. We cun do it here
THE FIERY CROSS
q
British Peer is
on Labor Cabinet
LORD PARMOOR
In foming the new Labor ministry
in England, Ramsay MacDonald, the
prime minister, used good sense, ac
cording to all sections of the English
press. Instead of forming a cabinet
composed entirely of labor members,
and pursuing a socialistic policy, as
many feared he would do, he has se
lected the cabinet from all parties
and ranks. Lord Parmoor, lord presi
dent of the council, is a member of
the cabinet. Lord Parmoor was a
power in London politics long be
fore MacDonald was known, and
brings to his office many years' ex
perience. It is expected he will re
flect much credit upon Labor’s ad
ministration of British national af
fairs.
in America by making sure through
all the agencies of the church mov
ing upon our national life that we
bear ourselves as a Christian nation
before the world. I do not say that
the nation must be Christian because
the church demands it of it. The na
tio nmust be Christian because the
nation lies under the la wof God and
is an institution of Go das surely as
the church is. This nation of ours
is under Christian sanctions and
Christian obligations that the church
did not lay upon her, but which are
there because she herself is an in
stitute of God. How much are we
doing by every true Christian action
in our national life, only the judg
ment day will disclose. We have an
illustration of this now in the out
going of the whole heart of Japan to
ward us. “America may scrap her
battleships,” wrote Dr. Reischauer
from Tokio, “for she will not need
them in the matter of her relation
ships to Japan.” What has happened?
In the last few months $10,000,000
given in sympathy and good will
through the Red Cross, less than one
third of the cost of a battleship, has
made, unless new wrongs arise, a
fleet superfluous so far as any need
of the Japanese is concerned. We
need more and more to Christianize
our own life and example that every
impact by which we affect directly
the other nations of the world should
be Christian, that every man who goes
out to represent this nation in any
political capacity in any non-Chris
tian nation should go in the con
sciousness that he goes from a Chris
tian nation and a Christian people to
behave as a Christian man. Even
those who go to carry on trade with
the other nations of the world should
go as men whose lives are made
clean by'the Christian ideal, and who
will carry on their trade in Christian
fairness and equity and justice.
But beyond these things, God is
calling us today with a plainer and
more unmistakable voice than ever
before, directly to preach the Lord
Jesus Christ to the whole generation
of which we are a part. Never was
the door so wide open for that
preaching. Miss Hodge was speaking
this afternoon of one field, I think it
must have been Colomia, with an area
greater than that of Germany,
France and Belgium, and with a
smaller missionary force than you
could find in any Presbytery in the
Synod of Ohio, and five or six million
of friendly folk, willing to welcome
any friendly help. I have traveled
up and down the Magdalena and seen
the hundreds of places where no one,
Protestant or Catholic, is witnessing
to the Gospel. And I was thinking
of astill wider area than this, un
reached and waiting. I rode last
winter, a year ago, as far as from
Cleveland to New York, in an old
wagon across the plains of Northeast
Persia. We went from village to
village, and from cit yto city, and in
that long stretch of between 600 and
700 miles, there was not a single rep
resentative of Christ making His Gos
pel known to those people for whom,
with us, He lived and died. We
walked to and fro in the streets of
the sacred city of Meshed, and saw
the folks gathered from all over west
ern central Asia, all that western
slope of the roof of the world, pass
ing through the streets of that old
sacred Persian city ,and you could
draw a radius, not of 600 miles, it
would have to be 1000 miles north,
and 200 miles eastward, and all the
long journey southward to the waters
of the Persian gulf, and you would
have an area half the size of the
United States, and not one single
Missionary in all that great area ex
cept the little band of our people in
the city of Meshed. I was thinking
of those great needs opening before
us in our fields in the province of
Shantung, where in the area of a
single station there are populations
four or five times larger than the
population of Cleveland to be reached
by little handfuls of missionaries.
And I thought o fthe 400,000.000 of
China dependent upon these, for ev
ery vital impulse that is to cleanse
,nd purify ana upbuild their national t
life. I read the other day an address
by Mr. F. W. Stevens, the representa
tive in Peking of the American Bank
ers who are grouped with the bank
ers of the other great nations in the
financial consortium that is controll
ing the foreign loans of China. You
may have known of him as professor
of la win the University of Michigan.
Here is his impression, the judgment
of a careful, competent and informed
man: “I have come to believe that
America’s greatest contribution to
China, greater than even America’s
political friendship, is the work of
the American Christian missionaries.
Moral regeneration must precede any
great political and industrial im
provement. In all China there is not
a single organization on a scale of
importance that aims at moral de
velopment, or that is calculated to
bring it about, that is not traceable
to the Christian missions. I have in
quired among all kinds of people
from all parts of China for such an
activity of non-Christian origin, with
out finding one.”
And in other lands than China. I
read Dr. Fulton’s letter this after
noon regarding that newly opened
door into the hearts of the people of
Japan. My friends, it was an open
door already. I cut out of a paper
before the earthquake came with all
its influence on the Japanese heart
and mind, a statement of one of the
ablest Christian men in Japan, and
he was speaking of the great forces
that are struggling for the mastery
of Japan, the labor, the socialist, the
communist movement, and the Chris
tian movement was among them, and
he said: “I believe the real regener
ation of Japan depends entirely on
the united forces of the Christians,
especially the Christians of Japan.
America, and Great Britain. If Chris
tians lose Japan, it will be an irre
mediable loss to Christendom.” He
closed his statement with these
words: ‘‘l do not ignore the impor
tance of work in China. It is impor
tant, just as in any other part of the
world, but China is an immense coun
try. The work there is the work of
centuries. Here in Japan we have a
small but powerful nation, similar
to the ancient Greek or the Jewish
nation. She will be converted in half
a century if we are fully prepared
to meet her need. If we understood
the need in Japan, we would not hes
itate to advocate a four-fold increase
of missionary forces, forces sufficient
to make short work of the evangeli
zation of Japan. Japan as a con
verted nation would herself become
the vangaard of the missionary forces
on the Asiatic continent.”
And I was thinking still further of
another larger land in which there
are deeper and more radical forces
still, seething among the 3250.00,000
of India, and seething Christward.
Mr. Gandhi himself is said to have
charged the young men of India that
he could give no better advice than
that they follow Jesus Christ, if they
would make India great and free.
And the presidential address of C. R.
Dass, the President of the last Na
tional Conference, circled around
four long quotations from the New
Testament, and he upheld the exam
ple and teachings oi Christ as war
rant for the character of their policy
in trying to win India’s freedom. In
dia is full of men who are feeling
after Christ, like the late Sir Nar
ayan Chandavarkar, that noble man
who died only a few weeks ago. I
had written to him a few months
since asking if he would write out
for me a statement of his views as
to the possible solution of the prob
lem of race relationship, and there
is no one here who could have written
a nobler Christian statement, seeing
Christ as the only possible solution.
I had called on him two years ago.
and on the wall of his library was a
large picture of Mr. Spurgeon, and
when he came down and I spoke to
him, he said, “When I was in Lon
don I always went on Sunday morn
ing to hear Spurgeon. ” And he
told a friend of mine: “If you will
come to my bedroom I will show you
a picture of our Lord.” There on the
wall of his bedroom, the leading Hin
du of Western India, Vice Chancel
lor of the University, Chief Judge of
the Supreme Court, President of the
Legislative Council, had hung a pic
ture of his an dour Lord.
I say agair>, never were the oppor
tunities so large or the possibilities
so rich and free for us as now. as we
stand on the threshold of what ought
to be the largest and boldest advance
that the Christian church has made
toward the fulfillment of its mission
ary responsibility. And yet we stand,
and halt, and debate, as to whether
or not, after all, we shall not have to
turn our faces back. Two difficul
ties confront us. There is the bur
den of deficit and there is the dread
of division. I spoke about the defi
cit this afternoon. Let me say one
word more. We are not passing
through anything that is not com
mon to many. I got a letter from a
gentleman in Pittsburgh recently se
verely criticising us on several
counts. ,He said lastly: “You will
notice that the Foreign Boards of the
other denominations are in no such
straits as you are.” I wrote back
that I wished it were so, but that the
rest were in a worse plight than we.
This week I asked Dr. North of the
Methodist Board of their situation,
and it was far worse than ours. Three
years ago they had a deficit of $3,-
000,000. and they are still carrying a
deficit of over 51. 200,000. The Amer
ican Baptist Missionary Society closed
year before last with a deficit of
$950,000, which it was able last year
happily to reduce to $661,000. The
Protestant Episcopal Missionary So
ciety closed its last fiscal year with
a deficit of $952,000. In every one of
these cases the scale of operation is
less than of our own, save with the
Methodists. Proportionately they
are carrying a larger burden than we
are.
How could you expect that the
Presbyterian Board would not bear
burdens like these in days like these?
I find in my papers the great appenl
which the New York hosnitals send
out every year unitedly. It says that
last year it cost them $2.04 per pa
tient. This year it cost them $3.74
per patient. It costs us in our for
eign mission hospitals less than 26c
per patient, while we treat many
times as many patients in our hos
pitals as the New York City hosnl

things, but I came upon this clipping
yesterday, an advertisement in one of
the New York dailies by a banking
firm in Broad Street, in which it is
declared that: “America’s largest to
bacco man says that hard times nev
er affect the tobacco industry. We
don’t know of any tobacco company
that ever passed its dividend.” To
bacco dividends and miison deficits!
But I know of one little church that
has taken its foreign mission sub
scription recently, and it is S3O per
member for foreign missions alone.
If we could reach that average in
every church, we would have $50,-
000,000 to $60,000,000 for foreign mis
sions in the Presbyterian church
alone. This deficit of ours which we
are confronting, well. God be thanked
for the summons and appeal such a
cal Ifrom the lLader who is summon
ing us now, not to cleave to the old
and low levels from which Dr. Mudge
has been calling us„ but to step for
ward to deal with our present re
sponsibility in terms worthy of men
who believe in Jesus Christ, and who
measure the expression of devotion
to the will of God by Christ’s cross.
And as for the dread of division.
We are not divided. And no man
shall divide us. This is our church,
our fathers’ church. Who can sepa
rate us from it? And in heart our
church is one great body, in heart and
faith. All of us here tonight would
stand as one man and say with un
qualified devotion and ocnfidence ev
ery article of the Apostles’ Creed.
We pillow our heads on every last
word of the New Ttestament of our
Lord and Saviour. We are bound to
gether in one great faith, in loyalty
to one great Lord. We have lived
through long generations of unity,
the blood of Presbyterian ancestors
runs in our veins, and we intend to
hold together in loyalty, in common
faith, and common purpose and com
mon devotion to our task until the
end, when unitedly we will welcome
our Lord back again. We stand con
fronting this great task, and we know
the price, the price in pain to Him,
and in same to ourselves, and in eter
nal loss to the world, if we do not
fulfill our duty.
I was speaking this afternoon of
some of the things that must be
done, if this deficit and the needs of
the year are not met. Consider them
again. If the work is to be cut
down, where will you cut it? In Ja
pan, facing such conditions as Dr.
Fulton’s letter described? In India,
when today we are passing over the
administration of the missionary work
in India to the Christian church
there? This would be the last of all
days for us to cut down our assist
ance for the evangelization of India.
The Indian church would say: “Oh.
yes, you will trust ws now when there
is nothing with which you are will
ing to trust us.” Will you close the
hospitals? I was thinking of that
hospital in meshed. I got this week
a letter from one of the doctors
there enclosing his check for SIOO,
whieh was his contribution in the
crisis we are facing. I remember go
ing through the wards. At the head
of every bed was the tablet with the
man’s name, the city from which he
came. It was a lesson in Asiatic ge
ography. They came from all over
western and central Asia to visit the
Mohammedan shrines in Meshed, and
they were going to bear the gospel
which thev had heard to all western
Asia. Wiil you close that hospital?
The nearest westward is 700 miles
away; the nearest one to the south
east is 2,000 miles. The nearest one
straight east is, I suppose, 3,000 miles.
The nearest one northeast, well. I
don’t know that you would come to
one until you came to Pekin. Will
you close such an institution as that?
My friends, we simply cannot go
back. There is no voice behind us

tators See Ceremonies
at Night
MIAMI, FLA., March 10. —In the
glare of a cross of fire, 400 candi
dates were initiated last night into
the John B. Gordon Klan No. 24 of
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan at
the municipal athletic field
Approximately 10.000 spectators
looked on during the ceremony, and
1,500 Klansmen participated in tha
initiation.
Preceding the initiation a parade
of Klanstnen formed promptly at
7:30, headed by policemen and
Klansmen mounted on motorcycles,
followed by a guard of Klansmen on
horseback, who surrounded a motor
car in which officials of the Klan
rode. After this came the Klan pat
rol excellently drilled, which drew a
great deal of applause from the
spectators on each side of the line of
march. After this came the motor
cade of 100 automobiles bearing
members of the Klan.
Even before the crowd had gather
ed at the municipal athletic field,
but not until the large amphitheater
was crowded and the late arrivals
were forming lines on both sides of
the fields, two fire-lighted crosses
suddenly appeared across the field,
lighting up the scene and displaying
Klansmen gathered well away from
the crowd, for tha purpose of admin
istering the naturalization cere
mony.
As the light of the two crosses
died away, a serpentine line of fire
ran up a tall pine tree standing at a
little distance, lighting the third
cross which was far up in the
branches of the tree. As the light
of the cross died, a fourth, larger
than the former ones, sprang into
view and its red rays played on the
scene during the entire ceremony.
The line of Klansmen acting as
guards kept the crowd well back
from the scene of the initiation so
that none of the secret work could
he observed. Only the white-robed
figures as distinguished from the
candidates, who were in civilian
dress, could be seen.
At the close of the initiation an
address was delivered by Charles H.
Ketchum of Key West, Grand Dra
gon for the state of Florida, who
then introduced General Nathan Bed
ford Forrest, Grand Dragon of Geor
gia. At the close of his talk the
crowd was asked to stand while all
joined in singing “America.” A min
ister was called for to come forward
and pronounce a benediction. One
came from the crowd of newly-ini
tiated Klansmen, took his stand on
the platform, pronounced a short
benediction ana the ceremony was
closed.
a little boy and his father who had
sat through a service in church side
by side. At last the sermon was end
ed and the little boy looked up in
his father’s face and he said, “Father,
is the sermon done?” And the Wise
father put his arm around the lad’*
shoulders and said, “No, my son, the
sermon has been said. It is not done.
It is for you and me to do it.”
By the grace of God, for the love
of Christ, let us do it!
