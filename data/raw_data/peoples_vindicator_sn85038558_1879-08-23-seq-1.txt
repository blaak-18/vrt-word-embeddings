THE GENUINE
DR C. X.LANE'S
Celebrated American
WORM SPECIFIC
VERMIFUGE.
SYMPTOMS OF WORMS.
THE countenance is pale and lead.
•eneolored, with occasional flushes,
or a circumscribed spot on one or both
* cheeks; the eyes become dull; the
,a pupils dilate; an azure semicircle
runs along the lower eye-lid; the
nose is irritated, swells, and sometimes
bleeds; a swelling of the upper lip;
occasional headache, with humming
or throbbing of the ears; an unusual
secretion of saliva: slimy or furred
tongue; breath very foul, particularly
in the morning; appetite variable,
sometimes voracious, with a gnawing
sensation of the stomach, at others,
entirely gone: fleeting pains in the
stomach; occasional nausea and vom
iting; violent pains throughout the
abdomen; bowels irregular. at times
costive; stools slimy, not unfrequent
ly tinged with blood ; belly swollen
b and hard; urine turbid; respiration
occasionally difficult, and accompa
nied by hiccough; cough sometimes
dry and convulsive; uneasy and dis
turbed sleep, with grinding of the
teeth; temper variable, but generally
x irritable, &c.
Whenever the above symptoms
are found to exist,
DR. C. McLANE'S VERMIFUGE
will certainly effect a cure.

I bid farewell to moeat and greens and

I'm goitng a conntry to eat flour bread

There is gold and silver plenty
And my puree is empty,
In that beautiful Kansas
Whereon I wrote thes stanzas,.
No work to do.
An' plenty 'basca to chew,
In that happy land
Where "slick darkeys stand

There is a bapppy Iond far in the West,
Where happy black folks are the blest of

Where pretty gals in pretty gown
Walk the streets in all the towns.

Their forces ; over the sea

As in my mighty sovereign's ox-bide

And are so keen that be is straight aware
Of faintest pig.whispers can stir the air ;
When he lifts up his voice and sings some

At once the skies rain down their falling

His beels are clothed with thunder and,

soil free from weeds and grass Is the
most suitable. Then manure, ashes,

deep trenones, letting them be some
