A DEATHBED REPENTANCE.
Hoke 'Smith is a mighty amusing
person. We refer to the governor of
Georgia, who was beaten for re-elec
tion last year and will make way for
ugly little Jo Brown within the next
few months.
Georgia is eccentric in many things,
especially in the matter of her chief
executives. The people elect the gov
ernor’s successor the year after he is
inaugurated, at a time when he is
hardly warm in his seat, and hasn’t
had the opportunity to get the hang
of the new machinery. If he succeeds
himself, as is the usual custom, well
and good. In that event he has two
or three years of leisure in which to
formulate and exploit his policies,
whatever they may be. If, as hap
pened in Hoke Smith’s case, his down
fall is decreed and a new man named
to supersede him, what is he? An
official whose end is in sight before
he has begun, a reed shaken by the
wind. This is what befell our Hoke
Smith.
But nothing can wholly suppress
him, or so much as loosen the bond
between his acts and utterances and
the newspapers. He is no longer a
possible factor in public events. Even
the wave of prohibition which con
curred with his election was the pre
cursor not the consequence of his
triumph. So also with the railroad
persecution. He rode into office upon
that crest; he did not cause or stimu
late it. He professed and he manipu
lated all the whims and schisms of the
hour without having originated a
single one of them.
He took the whirlwind as it came,
he bestrode it, he galloped into office
with nothing but his debts to guide
him afterward; and before he got
easy in his chair Georgia repented of
her lunacy and turned to other
guidance.
Now he denounces and repudiates
Bryan, the one time Peerless, as if
any one would listen to his eleventh
hour counsels. He doesn’t think
IBryan ought to run again and doesn’t
believe he has a following any longer.
We all know that; but it was his
business to know it and proclaim it
in the summer of 1907, when he was
potent and successful and when a
word from him might have arrested
the preposterous stampede. The trou
ble with Hoke Smith is that he is a
short-sighted and fumbling statesman.
Bland, beaming, flatulent in his hour
of prevalence, he is without the wit
to seize and utilize a beckoning emer
gency. He sinks behind the rising
sun of little ugly Jo Brown, and these
deathbed outcries and expostulations
as the waters close over his fat and
futile head will challenge no notice
whatsoever.

It is too late to make a specialty
of Bryan’s occultation. That is of
common knowledge. It is abroad and
it is riotous. —New York Sun.
PEOPLE’S PARTY.
The first national convention of the
People’s Party was held in 1892 in
Omaha, Neb. Its first platform re
minds one of Roosevelt’s message of
January 27, 1908. It stated that
already the “nation has been brought
to the verge of moral, political and
material ruin;” that “ corruption
touches even the ermine of the
bench,” and that “from the same
prolific womb of governmental in
justice we breed the two great classes,
tramps and millionaires.”
The decline of the People’s Party
began with its “fusion” with the
Democrats.
Watson always maintained that the
party organization and identity should
be maintained. He urged a “middle
of-the-road” course in 1896, when he
protested against fusion on Presiden
tial electors. The existence of the
party name today is due perhaps as
much to Watson as to any other single
influence. *
Like many other movements which
have seemed to fail, the People’s
Party has rendered an undoubted
service to the country. While the
party waned its principles have
waxed. What shocked the country—
or much of the country’s more timid
element —in 1892 and in 1896, and
were denounced as “crazy populism,”
has come to be accepted as the “pro
gressive policies” which all the peo
ple want and are determined they
shall have.
Control of corporations, restriction
of the injunction, better hours for
labor, protection of the child and
woman in the factory, government
ownership of government utilities and
postal savings banks are a few of the
things to which the other parties are
indebted to the People’s Party.
Like many an individual, standing
honestly for a principle, this party
has won where it has seemed to fail.
—Gilson Gardner in Cincinnati Post.
A WARNING TO BORROWERS.
A man who was too economical to
take his home paper sent his little
boy to borrow a copy taken by his
neighbor. In his haste the boy ran
over a $4 stand of bees and in ten
minutes looked like a watery summer
squash. His cries reached his father,
who ran to his assistance and failing
to notice a barbed wire fence, ran
into that, breaking it down, cutting
a handful of flesh from his anatomy
and ruining ass pair of pants. The
old cow took advantage of the gap
Atlanta, Ga., Thursday, April 15, 1909
in the fence and got into the corn
field and killed herself eating green
corn. Hearing the racket, the wife
ran out, upsetting a four gallon churn
full of rich cream into a basket of
kittens, drowning the whole flock. In
the hurry she dropped a $7 set of
false teeth. The baby, left alone,
crawled through the spilled milk into
the parlor, ruining a brand new S2O
carpet. During the excitement the
oldest daughter ran away with the
hired man, the dog broke up eleven
setting hens, the calves got out and
chawed the tails off four fine shirts.

ONE SLAUGHTER THAT COULD
BE STOPPED.
Over 10,000 people are now killed
annually by our railroads, and over
100,000 injured. This is a fearful
record which is equaled by no other
country. Even after allowing for our
greater railroad business and railroad
mileage the slaughter on our railroads
is out of all proportion with that of
other countries. This is a most un
enviable record. It is. a blot upon
our country. And it should be wiped
out.
Not all of this large number of the
killed are passengers on the railroads
or employees. A very large propor
tion of them are people killed on the
track, and who had no business there.
The time will never come when no
passengers and no trainmen will be
killed—although the number of these
victims could be greatly lessened by
proper care —but the fatalities on the

track could be avoided altogether, and
very easily.
A few days ago an old lady was
killed on a trestle near Macon, where
she was caught by a train while walk
ing across it. A few nights ago a negro
man was killed on the track near
Augusta, struck by a train while he
was getting away after having com
mitted a murder. Thousands are
killed every year in this manner,
struck by trains on the track built
for trains and where pedestrians have
no business to be.
All these fatalities could be averted
simply by abolishing the custom which
makes a pedestrian road of the rail
road tracks. It is allowed in no other
country, and it should be forbidden
here.
By abolishing grade crossings and
by breaking up the custom of using
the railroad tracks for pedestrian
roads the annual railroad slaughter
in our country could be reduced one
half. Statistics show that nearly two
thirds of the number killed are other
than employees and passengers, which
means that they are either tramps
stealing rides or people killed on the
tracks, and mostly the latter. This is
a slaughter that could easily be
stopped, and it should be done.
Abolish all grade crossings and by
law forbid the use of the railroad
rights-of-way to pedestrians.—Augus
ta, (Ga.) Herald.
