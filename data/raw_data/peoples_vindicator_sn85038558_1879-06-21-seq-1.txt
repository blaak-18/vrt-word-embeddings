DR. C. XoLANE'S
CELEBRATED I
LIVER PILLS
S I·CR TIIE CURE OF
Hepatitis, or Liver Complaint,
DYSFEPSIA AND SICK HIEADACHI.
Symptoms of a Diseased Liver.
PAIN in the right side, under the I
1 edge of the ribs, increases on pres- i
sure; sometimes the pain is in the left
side; the patient is rarely able to lie 1
on the left side; sometimes the pain a
is felt under the shoulder blade, and
it frequently extends to the top of the
shoulder, and i§ sometimes" mistaken
for rheumtatistn in the arm. The stom
ach is affected with loss of appetite I
and sickness; the bowels in general
are costive, sometimes alternative with C
lax; the head is troubled with pain,
accompanied with a dull, heavy s*n
sation in the back part. There is gen.
erally a considerable loss of memoi, 1'
accompanied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done. A slight, r
dry cough ia sometimes an attendant.
The patient. complains of weariness v
and debility; he is easily startled, his a
feet are cold or burning, and he com- t
plains of a prickly sensation of the ,
skin; his spirits are low; and although v
he is satistied that exercise would be V
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely j1
summon up fortitude enough to tryi it.
in fact, he distrusts every remedy.
Several of the above symptoms attend
the disease, but cases have occurred
where few of them existed, yet exam
ination of the body, after death, has
showi the LIVER to have been exten
sively deranged.
AGUE AND FEVER.
DR. C. MCLANE'S LIVER PILLS, IN ii
CASES OF AGUE AND FEVER, whena
taken with Quinine, are productive of r
the most happy results. No' better . a
cathartic can be used, preparatory to, 11
or after taking Quinine. We would
advise all who are afflicted with this
disease to give them a FAIR TRIAL.
For all bilious derangements, and ,
as a simple purgative, they are un
equaled. I

A conuldtor on tii@ Michigan Cen

day. Tie train, comiing east, had
just left Jackson, whoen the man from
Laadville was discovered on the
platf,.rml of the tear car. le selemed
to have an object in belog out there
instead of in thie car, but the coo.
doctor was decived as to 1his motive.
Coniduetmrs rarely eve-r get hold of
the correct theory when they llnd a,
Iman with 'a long neck and a lean I
suchel sitting out oun the rear platform.
"Ti ying to beat miy way-great r
heavens! but how can you say that " I
replied tile lman from Leadville to the
conductor's brief but vigorous saints. e
tion. "No, sir ee f I calne out lere

The conducilctor suggested that he 1
enter time car and pay his fare at

don't seemi to care a clam -shell whetbl

the cars, anlld returned. The owner o
of the huckleberry mWie was no long
er on the platform, but was sound 7
asleep in the center of one of the 1
coaches. *
"Pay my fare!" le abshouted, as the c
conductor gave him a vigorous shak
