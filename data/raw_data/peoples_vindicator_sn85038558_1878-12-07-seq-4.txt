uion, and a quarter part of benzole.
Backed Mackerel.-Take off the

to mix not very thick or stiff.l
Cranberry Pudding.-One cupful
and a half of milk, three-fourths of a
cupful of nice molasses, a teaspoonful
of salt, one of cinnamon, tlhre cups
ful of flour, and a teaspoonful of
soda. Stir well together, and add
two cupfuls of raw cranberries. Pour
into a tin dish, and steam an hour
and a quarter. Eat with sweetened
cream and nutmeg, or other sweet
sauce.
Coconnut Custard.-To I pound
grated cocoanut allow one pint of new
milk and six ounces sugar. Beat
well the yolks of six eggs, and stir
them alternately in the mIilk with the
cocoannut and sugar. Put the mix
ture into a pail or pitcher, set it into
boiling water, and stir all the time
till very smroothli and thick; as soon
as it conies to a hardI boil, take it off,
aniiil ere in cunps or glass tumblers.
Sieaiiced Hick.-W\Vasli the rice wel-l,
let it soak about an hour in luke
wn iiin water, stir ii a teaspoonful of
snilt, set the dish in thile steamer over
a kettle of boiling water, and steam
one hounr. Stir two or three times;
add no water after it begins to cook,

Olot-Il]. I.ut it steam four or five
hours, stirring once or twice. To be
aNten hot or cold, with rich milk or
cream, if you are fortunare to have
it. Many use a little sugar with it,
and also with Graham pudlding. As
this popular article of diet is univer
uaillo used, this recipe may not come
amiss.
Wholesome Pie Crust.-The most
health pie crust is made of thin,
sweet cream and flour, with a little
salt. Don't knead. Bake in a quick
oven. Another way is, sift a quart or
two of flour in the pan. Stir in the
center a little salt and a half a tea
sponuiful of soda, well pulverized.
Put in acup of soft (not liquid) lard,
or butter and lard mixed; stir it
thoroughly with the flour; next add
two scant cops of good sour milk or
buttermilk. Stir all quickly with
flour in such a way that you need
hardly touch it with your hands till
you can roll it out. Bake quick.
This will make three or four pies.

SPECIAL OFFER.
THE NEW YORK
WEEKLY WORL),
All Eight-Page Newspaplr,
will beseut (posfage perpaid)
Fromnt ow Until Januarly 1, 1,79
FOR
TEN CENTS.
[tThis Special Offer is made to enable the
Southern people to see for thenmselves how good
a paper THE WORLD is and how worthy it is
of their sudport.
On the eInt of May, lati76, the ownership and
cont role of TIlE WORLD panssed into the hands
of the undersigned, under whose absolute and
tutramnmelled directions THE WORLD lhas
ever since remained and now remains.
D)uring the whole of this time TUHE WORLD
hasw labored patiently and perseveringly fort lie
accomplishmient of two objects in politicsn of
paramount interest to the Southern people.
I. The restoration of Local Self-Government
at the South.
II. A Real Reform of the Civil Service, in
such wise a4 to destroy the political machines
undtler the opperation of which it has come to
pass that the people are taxee to support politi
cal parties, whereas political parties have no
other reason of being except to lessen the bur6
den on the government.
The firstof these objects have been triumph
antly accomplished. All inteligent Northen
men now admit that all parts of the country
were as deeply interested as the South in seeing
it won. A corrupt sad anti-Democratic govern.
ment in the South was a permanent peril to the
ascendancy of true American principles in the
IFederal Government and therefore to the peace
and honor of the whole people.
The second political object for which THE
W(ORLD) conteuds still remains to be fully ach
ieved. The actual Administration began its
career with excellent promises in this direc
liion of which it is sullfficient to say that they
have been na yet only in part redeenmed. TIHL
WOR LD tor its part will resolutely support any
honest efforts to redeem these promises fully,
by wlhousoever made, and will as resolutely do
dounce every obstical tlhrowni in the way of re
deeming them, from whatever quarter
It seems to the undersigned eminently proper
that hIe should ask the co-operation of the best
men of the South with THE WORLD in its ef
forts to carry out the policy here outlined- He
believes TUE WORLD to be a paper which
Southern citizens and Democrate can recom
mend to Southern readers as an influece worthy
and important to be brought to hear with con
stenoutly increasing power upon our national af
airs, in the interest of truth, ofjustice and of
a rmony among our people of all sections.
It is niv desire to keep THE WORLD in a
lively relation with the beat thoughts of the
South, to the end that the best ideas, wishes
and feelings of the Southern people may be
clearly and fairly known to the North; the East
and the West. Alike in prtvate and in public
atffairs the mnisunderstanding of men by one an
other lies at the root of so lunch evil that the
weird itself has conme to be a synonym with
quarreling and strife. It was a wise saying of
,ord Elgin, at the time of one of our sharpest
disputes with Great Britain, that two intelli
gent gentlemen alone on a raft in the Atlantic
with plenary power could adjust the whole imat
ter hlonorably in an hour.
THE WClLD simply asks its friends at the
South to aid it in bringing about a complete
meeting of minds on all public questions be
tween ine Iutelligent citizen of part of the
Union, WILLIAM HENRY URLBERT.
