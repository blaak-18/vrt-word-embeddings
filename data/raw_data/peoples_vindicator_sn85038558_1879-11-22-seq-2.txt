As the Democratic party is now
about to engage In anothebirpitle
battle with Its enemleq in LodiASna.
It seems proper to defioIqly ded lre
Its alms and its statuse anpget us.
Under the term "Democrac," have
always been embodied all elements
and all men of every colnrthit have
been opposed to the rule of Radlial
Ism thisbe State. Thbi has embrae
ed the whole youtng white popula
tlon of the State-exept those class
es known by the g;enere names of
carpet-bagger, and scalawag. As
adiecalism ln this State has ever
been but soother word for corrup
tion, knavery, robbery, and venality,
so Democracy has been regarded as
its extreme antithesis, and the em
bodlmentof purity, juptlce. honesty
and rod 9avernment.. In other
States the white people may poselbly
be justified n dividingtabeir strength
upon lateral Issues and pursuing
separate and independent lines of
action, but not so here, because of
the faeet that every foe of Radicalism
and every friend of Loutsiana has
already enlisted under the banner
of Democracy. There is neither
room nor place for a third party
movement. All effte tsat reform, and
we freely grant that such may be
come naceseary, should be attempt
ed among the friends of Louisiana,
and ear among its notorious enemies,
or In other words, Inside of the Dew-a
oeratle organlitaon. No third par- ,
ty an ever hope to win to its sup.
port more than a small minority of
the white voters of the Demooratic
party. In order to succeed it must
Inevitably avail Itself of the Radical
party organisation, and make coma
mon cause with those who stand con.
vieted as wholly unt~rstworthy, .ud
the worst enemies of our State and
people. Every side Issue theretore
threatens us with the restoration: of
Carpet-bag government and Afrisa
Iuatton, whioh b certainly a greatCt
evil than any Uow sought to be rem
edied by the dlturblag faction in
our midst, knows as Oseenbackers.
With these fheta before us, and
just upon the eve of the electton it
becomei dar duty to make one more
sarest appeal through the columns ,
of the VYn~ oAon to the miesguided
white men who are engaged nla di
reetg this uwise anad dangerous,
mvemaent, We would msay to them
halt, before It is too late, and cease
your parrdal. strif against thei
Demoratic party, the nother fromr
whose beaefoleat womk has Issued
the Liberty of the people of Louls I 1
asa, the lantimable' boon of self
goversment, and every ight thatl
dear, to the hearts of freemen.

The great Crime.
The VINDrMATR has repeatedly
warned the Greenbackars bere that
there 'fforta to nrganfsZ a separate
party would result in the revival of
the Radieal party in Its wo4qt fe*"
tares, and perhaps the distruction of
the Democratcl host- the only safe
ty for or people. The Greenbsek
party has thus early suaceeded In
bringing to the front, In the order of
mareh to that eonsamation we
prophesied - the most notorousn char
acters of the palmy days of Radical
ism. The lnfamous sooundrels who
swore like the army In Flsnder,'tll
the lies brain could coneeive, in or
der to cram a Northern penitentiary
full of the best citisens of this par
ish.
SEarDICs BRowN, VAscoUs Mna-t
TY, VEBGIL BARAox, and others of
that stripe, are organisers, strikers
or members of this new and pure
party, that sickened of Democracy
and wants to pay the Natlunal debt
in rag money, redeemable in nothing.
And OunN; GRBEE, the notorious
seamp who threatened in speeches
in 1874, to lay in ashes the homesand
gin houses of any democrat who dare
ed to resist the "ring and its 8 per
cent taxes," is called upon to organ
ise clubs for the Greenback-Labor
party.
Is this not reviving Radlalism ?
When the dreg, bummers, bullies
and liars of Radicalism are encour
aged to organize the negro.
And organise him against whom?
The Demooracy I
And who are the Democrats? .
The white men of Natchitoches
Have our Greenback friends thought
over this state of affairs. Have they
seriously considered the consequen
eas of regulating this parish and
this people, their people, to the rule
of those whose names are the
synonym of everythlng base-to the
rule of the Radieal party.
And the band of experience points
with unerlng certanlaty to that end.
You enoarage- them now, and the
time will come when, with tears and
anguish, you will regret, aye bitterly
regret, you ever for a moment falter.
edin your allegiance to the grand
old party who has bees your only,
your true friend, In the hour when
friends were friends indeed, the
Democraey.
If there yet s one spark left of
that pride in your people, and their
heroic suferings, obme out of an
organisation which ~ their and your
bitterest, direstfoe.
TheOreenabaekers of Natchltoobhes
declare is their platform that the
Democratic party is "powedrem to
do the people good."

SMITFI ON A FENCE.
Smith is gittving trobhle in Cmnee
tict. Smith lives in two townrhips.
The boundary line bisects his house.
His leia resisene might be settled
with ease it his bed were on either
side the idoe, but, unhappily. Smith
sleeps with his head and shoulders
in Trumbull Townshbip and the rest
of him in Mo.roe. Were the mat
ter to be settled according to the an
swer given by a Sunday school boy
in the good old ,lays when Puritan
Connecticut was more dilligent than
now in the study of its shorter cate
obism, the trouble would soon be
over. This boy was asked. "What is
the chief end of man ?" He replied:
"The end that's got the head on."
Beyond controversy the head ed is
the chief end of Smith. If his legs
were sawed off he could still vote.
What might be left of him would
probably be carried to the polls in
one of the wagons kindly sent for
the aged and Infirm. But sever
Smith's head from his body and his
voting power is gone forever. A man
may go to the polls on wooden legs,
but no intelligent voter is supposed
to have a wooden head. It Issaid that
during his waking hours the whole
of Smith is- to Monroe Township.
That has nothing to do with it. Thou.
sands of men spend the day miles
from where they sleep, and Bill
Boullt still says that's what the mat
ter with the Greenback party. The
head is in the Republican party and
the tail is Oreenhackism.

TO THE PUBLIO.
W. A. Strong Esq., informs us that
William Boullt stated to him,

I have used Normand's Balm for sore
backs, galls, cuts, foot evil, &c. &c., in
horses, and found it very efficacious. It
is less trouble to use than other resmedies
and it is a sure cure.

Mr. Jules Normand
I have been afflicted for
several years with painful inflammation
and ulceration of my leg, resulting from
an injury sustained Iby mly buggy wheels
running over it, I have tried ulimny rem
edies without avail, until several months
ago I commenced the use of "Normnand's
Balm," which has been of great benefit
and is the only application, of the many
tried by me, which has afforded substan
tantial relief-I regard it as invaluable
and cheerfully recomend it for the cer
tain cure of bruises, wounds, cuts, inflam.
mation and ulceration.
Yours Respectfilly,
WILL. M- LEVY.

MR. J. H. NORMAND, Cloutierville, La.
Dear Sir-After suffering for thirty
years from a running nicer in the ear
occasioned by a wagon passing on my
head and- after having been operated
upon by Dr. Logan in New Orleans and
and not being cored, I tried some of your
balm and lam happy to say that after a
few applliaestions of it I got entirely well
and was radiceally acured.
A negro boy on my place cut his foot
with a plow and it was thought once
that it would have to be amputated but
after applying your balm on the wound
for a few days it heale np anid the boy
is now well. Again, George Cole, a
neighbor of mine, whilst shooting a gun,
a pIleaee ofthe cap flew in bis eye, we
tried the balm again and with snueeeus.
His eye got well after two applications
of the balm.
I eonclude by stating that in my epin.
ion youear balm is an invaluable medicine
and I will take pleasure in recommend.
lag it to the pnblie.
Very respeetfully,
W. A. CURRBBY.

Gents-I take pleasnre in recoumend
ling your Balm. I have always found it
•egeacious. Some four years ago an old
colored servant of mine was confned to
her bed with an nleer on her leg. My
wife believing strongly in the virtue of
Syear Balm, coneluded to use some of it
and in a very short time effeeted a eare.
The old wonman is iow well and able to
testify to the same.
