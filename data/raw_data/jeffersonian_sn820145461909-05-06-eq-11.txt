The Tear In the Cup
Sy OPIE READ
I was in a Southern town, standing
in front of a saloon—indeed, it would
have been hard to stand elsewhere,
unless the inside instead of the out
side of the “doggery” had been
selected —when my attention was at
tracted by several men who stood
near. They appeared to be reminded
of a good joke and were looking down
the street.
1 ‘That was a great joke,” said one
of the men; and I, being somewhat
on the look-out for great jokes, asked :
“What joke was that?”
“Joke on old Jasper—that old fel
low coming along yonder. A man
that don’t now him wouldn’t see the
point very well, I don’t reckon. Old
fellow that edits a paper here, but he
don’t amount to much; he uster be
pretty well up, though—married the
handsomest girl in this town a long
time ago; but I guess she’s mighty
tired of him.”
Old Jasper came up, and the men
began to laugh.
“How are your coppers this morn
ing?” the fellow who had been ex
plaining to me asked. “Reckon you’d
like to down a bowl this morning,
wouldn’t you?”
The old man stopped, took off his
hat, wiped his brow, and answered:
“You boys are privileged to guy
me, I suppose. You thought you’d
played a great joke on me, didn’t
you?”
“Come on in, old man, and have
something. ’ ’
“Wait,” he said. “You boys got
me drunk and thought it was a great
joke. It was surely a very easy joke.
Got me to go fishing with you and
left me lying on the bank of the creek
drunk. That was a manly—a merci
ful joke, wasn’t it? You slipped back
to town and told it about the streets
and laughed about it. .My little boy
heard vou and went home and told his
mother.
“The sad case of Hon. George H.
Bell,” who committed suicide after
being liberated from the insane
asylum, has been made much of by
those ultra conservative newspapers
and writers who think that after a
man is once incarcerated he should be
kept in durance, and treat as settled
the mooted question whether a man
may commit suicide who is not in
sane. The fact is that Bell had
plenty of troubles to cause a sane
man to take his life if he felt that

‘Cjfye 3effersortiari
“Oh, what a night I passed! I was
so sick that I couldn’t raise my head.
I heard the creek rippling with a re
proachful murmur; a mocking-bird
sang all night long —-sang to his mate,
the object of his tender care —«and I,
who had neglected every obligation,
wished that the ground might swallow
me. I dozed troublously toward
morning, and when I awoke the sun
was shining, and there, beside me, sat
my wife, patching a pair of little
trousers that she had brought with
her. I did not dare to look up. I
could not meet those patient eyes—
eyes that told of years and years of
suffering. I was burning up with
thirst.
“ ‘Mary, how long have you been
here?’ I iasked.
“ ‘Nearly all night,’ She answered
with a sob.
“‘I am nearly dead, Mary. Won’t
you please bring me a drink of
water ? ’
“She had brought a cup with her.
Ah, how well she had anticipated my
wants! She went down to the creek,
and I raised up and watched her as
she dipped the cup into the shining
stream. She came back slowly, and
just before she handed me the water,
she leaned over to hide her eyes, land
I saw a tear fall into the cup. I
reached forth inv hand —I drank the
water and the tear, and, throwing
down the cup, I clasped my hands
and said:
“ ‘Mary, ever since you became my
wife I have been drinking your tears.
I have been drinking your tears and
your anguish, and 1 swear, in the
presence of the Eternal God, that I’ll
die before I ever do it again.’ ”
He put on his hat, looked at the
leading joker, and said:
“No, I will >.,>t drink with you. and
I warn you to keep out of my way.
Good morning.”

USURY
The Anti-Usury League publishes a
book dealing with the injustice of in
terest. The book is called “Usury”. It
contains 300 pages, is neatly bound in
cloth, and is sent prepaid for one dol
lar. This book knocks the pegs from
jnder the national banks It shows
their infamous origin, thfeir grip and
their danger to the republic. It shows
the remedy for the social and industrial
evils which unpractical reformers are
seeking. It is not pessimistic, though
it treats of oppressive injustices; hut
is emphatically hopeful of the complete
victory over giant wrongs when the
uew-old remedy here advocated is ap
plied. Whether you be a Christian or
a pagan, write for it today. It will
make you a wiser citizen: it will give
you a higher conception of what true,
noble manhood should be. It will give
you a higher ideal for your own life,
and of the fraternal relations that
should prevail among men.
