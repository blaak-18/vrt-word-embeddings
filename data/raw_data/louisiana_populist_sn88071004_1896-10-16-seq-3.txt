The contest case over the shreiv
alty of Jones vs. Freemian is set for
trial Friday and will doubtless con
sumo the greater part of next week.
The court rulings in the case so
far have been very fair and impar
tial. No one seems to doubt but that
Jones will win the case, hence the
detenee are fighting only for time
It was disgusting to hear the
V lawryes plead for time to file their
answer when the suit was institut
ed last June, and when it was ru
mored on the streets aboult that
time that they declared their abili
ty to stave off the c4ie tour years
and then they didn't give a d-n
what the tidcisioti was.

The Populists have always been
right and have always led in the

ciple that Hon. B. W. Bailey ad
vocates and every true reformer of
this district should vote for him.

The first, and so far .Li we know
the only, place' where the I)e.,.
cratic Boardl of Supervisors ha.
fa iled to keep the Fusion agree
nrent is in Ralides.
This pari-h hbs an infamonus
reputationfor hallot-box stuffing
all over the State and nation, and
it sueems that she does not intend to
improve at this election.
The Board of Supervisors refus
ed to appoint the commissioners
and watchers recommended by the
Populists and instead appointed
negroes at Bovce, Wiel's Store,
Alexandria, Cheneyville, etc. nam
ing a few Populists in the hills
where democrats are scarce, but
" taking care to name none recom
mended by the Populist commit
tee.
r The Fusion committee was im
mediately appealed to by the Pop
ulists and Capt. J. M. Foster at
once called a meeting of his com
mittee which was had at Alexan
dria last Monday, Mr. D. C. Scar
borough of this place and all the
- other members attending, and a
meeting of the Board of Supervi
sors was procured.
The committee appealed to the
Board to correct what they consid
1 ereda grave mistake and to allow
the Populists the representation
promised in the Fusion agreement.
1 The Board had apparently pre
1 meditated their action and were de
I termined to stand by it, as the ex
cuses offered were of the most
frivolous nature.
They finally agreed to change
their appointments at 18 polls and
place thereat the Populist commis
sioner asked for and to commis
t sion the Populist watchers at all
the 25 polls.
The seven polls which they re
fused to change, and which have
only Democratic and negro, or Re
publican, commissioners, are
Boyce, Wiel's Store, Alexandria,
Lamourie, Lecompte, Cheneyville
and Forest Hill.
These are the boxes which stuff
ed in 9800 fraudulent votes in 1894
against Bailey and in favor of Og
den, but they will hardly be able
to repeat the ;fraud, as the true
Democrats and the Populists of
that parish are aroused and will
permit no repetitions of the perju
ry and theft that has heretofore
been committed there in the name
of and to the disgrace of Democ
racy.
We believe the Fusion Commit
r tee are doing and will do all they
can uagainst this crime and we be
lieve the honest Democrats of the
district and State will ably second
their eforta.
Honestelectionsis the issue in
this State and it is growing, and
woe unto him that stands in the
way o it.

5th inst., .J. L. Fontenot of S.

and G. L. liiaton of Livingston.
secretary.
Resolutions were adopted re-af
. firming allegiance to the silver
cause, indorsing the action of the
conference committees of the Dem
socratic and People's parties in
agreeing upon one electoral ticket,
and pledging the united and hearty
support of the convention to Winm.
J. Bryan through said electoral
ticket.
t Dr. Wm. 31, Thompson. of St,
_ Landry was unanimously nominat
ed for congress, and Jos. L. Fon
tenot was made chairman of the
Congressional Executive commit
tee with S. C. Fridge, of Baton
Rouge, secretary.
The convention recogmnized the
_ fact that they were too late in the
field to elect their nomince, but
their duty was to furnish a candi
date for loyal Populists to vote for
and they did so.

e 3RD. DISTRICTr POPULISTS.
After having been turned down
' by the democrats refusing to nom
inate Judge Allen, the 3rd District
" populists met on Saturday the 3rd
inst. and nominated that most ex
- cellent man and thorough-going
- populist, W. D. Gooch, for con
t gress.
Bro. Gooch had a race, however,
e to get his name on the official bal
lot within the time prescrib~ed by
Slaw, but he made it, and had t i,
- minutes to spare. We hope he
I will pull through in November and
have ten votes to spare.
The Populists of the lst Con
C gressional District have nomina
e ted (by a petition of 1io names,)
Joseph Gazin of New Orleans for
e Congress.
Mr. Gazin is a representative
mechanic, a man of ability and
4 integrity, and he will poll a good
vote, which will serve to build up
e and strengthen the party in that
e section where it has never had a
f candidate before. Mr. R. D.
I Wilde, deserves much credit for
- this move.
e *4
e Populists of the 5th District are
making a hard fight with every
prospect for success.
Mr. Benoit is speaking every
V day, and the six Populist papers
in his district are hitting some
Sheavy blows for him. He is bound
to win.
I All of our readers know that
thorough-going planter of ward 3,
e J. C. Burnside. Well he has
made a success farming, and knows
the farmers' needs so well, that he
has opened headquarters for their
supplies here in Natchitoches. See
his Ad. for particulars.
