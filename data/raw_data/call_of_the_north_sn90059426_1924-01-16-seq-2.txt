THE CALL of the NORTH
I» published every Wednesday by the Call of the North Publishing Co., St. Paul, Minnesota,
and will stand for American institutions, principles, ideals and -traditions without fear
or favor.
Edited, not to make up people’s minds, but to shake up people’s minds; to help
mold active public opinion which will make America a proper place to live in.
News of truth kills more false news and shrivels up more '‘bunk" than all the earnest
arguments in the world. Truth helps to clarify opinions on serious questions by serious
people.
THE CALL OF THE NORTH will strive to give the American viewpoint on pub
lished articles and separate the dross from pure gold in the current news of the day.

A Klansman walked into my office,
heaved a sigh, and sat down to rest.
Upon inquiry as to why he seemed so
“heavily laden with grief,” he remark
ed that he wished that all of this mis
understanding, turmoil and persecu
tion would stop. This seemed rea
sonable, yet I have reflected over
that very same matter many times
and I have come to the conclusion that
it is better that things should continue
as they are. It seems harsh that I
should recommend that Klansmen wel
come intolerance against their order,
and persecution of it, BUT I DO.
It is under fire that the morale of
the soldiery is proved. It is from
out of the fire that the true metal
comes. It is because of the fire that
the temper is produced. Stiength
comes only after all dross has been
removed, and the true temper given.
Had the Klan been other than it is,
had the Klan had easier sailing than
it has had, the Klan would be one of
those lack-interest organizations that
has to send the sergeant-St-arms
into the highways and byways to shoo
in enough members to make a quor
um. The Klan would have .died in the
horning, or died of initiation.
We cannot prevent persecution. It
is, therefore, best to put up with it.
In fact it is best to court it. Welcome
any one who comes ignorantly on the
field to attack the Klan. Let those
try it who from dark designs or from
sheer intolerance and bigotry would
offer to destroy the Klan. You can’t
help it, so tolerate, aye, welcome it.
I will explain why. The riddle of the
universe has been solved by the Maker
of the universe. It was so simple in
its explanation that men overlooked
it entirely, and continue to overlook
it as the ages roll on. Looking for
something difficult, they have despised
the simple things of their experience
and hence have neglected that great
diamond, the solution of that great
riddle. God made it so plain that a
wayfaring man, though a fool, need
not err therein. God made it so plain
that he who runs may read.
Written by the Finger of God
“Surely God hath written it with
His own finger, in plain language,
concluded the wisest man who ever
lived, the poet, the singer, the preach
er,” yet the Holy Spirit of God hath
in these times directed that I again
indite it. “Accordingly Solomon in
about one score words again summed
up the whole thing, when he record
ed these words of Almighty God: Let
us hear the conclusion of the whole
matter; fear God and keep His com
mandments, for this is the whole duty
of man.” “Isn’t it plain? Isn’t it
simple? Wouldn’t it be ideal if all
men would get its full meaning ? But
they do not. The result is that men
in their attempts to solve that same
riddle have written whole libraries of
books since So.onion’s time. Further,
they will continue, in future genera
tions, to pile up library after library
of books on the same subject, and
when all is said and done and written,
they must, if they get the solution,
go back to the beginning and take
the words of Solomon, or similar ex
pressions of the same kind, written
under the direct supervision of Al
mighty God
The Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
are highly important. But not near
ly so important to man as the correct
solution of the whole matter. Man
who fails to make his peace with God,
and live under the direction of the Al
mighty, has made the great mistake.
There is no other mistake to such a
man. All other things are the slight
est of incidents to him who has out
lawed himself from the Kingdom of
God. The Klan is highly important,
but YOU ARE URGED TO FORGET
ALL OTHER THINGS, INCULDING
THE KLAN, IF YOU HAVE NOT
MADE PEACE WITH GOD, and feel
that you are a son of God, and a
joint heir with Jesus Christ. I would
not have any man misunderstand that
great question, nor would I have it
obscured by workings or ritual of any
secret organization, nor would I have
it treated on a par with any other
question in the world. I sincerely hope
that I make that supremely plain.
If the Klah were not important, it
would not be treated to the persecu
tion that has been meted it. Presidents
governors, supreme court judges, and
men in all walks of life would not
have gone out their way to cast a
stone at the Klan had it been anything
but important. Such people do not
fight unimportant things. The Klan
is important because it has a purpose,
a great purpose. Because of its great
purpose comes the persecution. To
keep it to its great purpose there
must come persecution. There is no
good cause' alive today that has not
suffered persecution. The better and
WHEN WILL IT END?
By SANBALLAT
greater the cause, the more severe
the persecution. To temper men’s
souls to do big things men must be
tried in the fire. Persecution is the
best of temper for Klansmen.
Ask me how I know that persecu
tion is the best form of temper for
Klansmen, and I will tell you because
when the Klan has been persecuted
the members of the Klan have rushed
together, regardless of any personal
differences, and have stood shoulder
to shoulder, man to man, and heart to
neart with each other in a common de
fense of that great order to which
they have given solemn promise never
to permit it to perish from the earth
excepting at the dictation and under
rhe hand of Almighty God. Ask me
low I know persecution is the best
form of temper for the Klan, when I
ook about me and see the Klan being
.ersecuted in one form or another,
from the slightest of persecution to
he highest forms, in every village,
lamlet and city of this universe; and
it the same time I see men all over
his lane rushing to the Klaverns and
asking that their names be written
on the membership rolls of the Klan.
Ask me how I know persecution is
good for the Klan, when I see men
who were but sympathizers with the
Klan, coming to the Klan and saying,
“Brother, I want to enroll under the
banner of the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan.”
Ask me how I know of
the Klan is good for the Klan, when
on every side I see women’s organiza
tions espousing the same principles,
gathering momentum in leaps and
bounds, and membership by the hun
dreds of thousands. Ask me how I
know persecution is good for the Klan,
when I see a junior order of Klansmen
coming along with a rush. Ask me
how the Klan will prosper on persecu
tion, when I see the 100 per cent na
turalized Americans, who hold to the
Protestant Christian faith, insistently
demanding that they be recognized
in an order of their own, affiliated with
and standing for the same principles
for which the Klan stands. Ask me
how I know that it is good for men’s
souls to be tried, when I talk to Pro
testant Christians and find that not
one in ten is against the Klan, but
that all know it is high time that the
Protestant men and women of Amer
ica amalgamate themselves into one
great mobile, cooperative body, to
withstand the onslaughts of hell that
nave been made against their reli
gions, their church, and the word of
God. Ask me that question when I
can see that persecution has made it
possible for all to say the Klan is
only beginning to grow.
Persecution is the whip that has
done more to stiffen the backbones of
Protestants than any other cause. It
has brought them together as nothing
else could have done. They recognized
the worthiness and the high principles
of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,
and they welcomed that agency to
weld them together into one mass of
militant men and women who desired
to march to higher things under the
Cross of the Master. They recognize
that marching to the tune of “Onward,
Christian Soldiers” in defense of the
things for which the Protestant
church holds sacred, and those things
for which “Old Glory” stands, they
would be irresistible.
Welcome, then, all forms of perse
cution, whether it be an ordinance
passed by the narrow-minded officials
in a Kansas town at the request and
upon the insistence of religious bigots
and intolerants, or whether it be the
assassination of Klansmen, as in the
case of Klansman Abbot at Carnegie
and many others throughout the coun
try. Welcome it whether it be the at
tempt to subjugate the minute men of
the Klan who reside in Topeka, or the
poor cripple who sold Klan papers on
the streets of Cincinatti. Welcome it
whether it be the fining of a newsboy
in a Louisville police court for selling
a Klan newspaper, or the attempt of
5,000 mobbers to snuff the lives
of 150 Klansmen of Perth Amboy, N.
J. Welcome it whether it be the
“frame np” of a Louisiana governor
or that of the lawless governor of
Oklahoma.
Welcome it, for out of it all we
shall see a new man coming from the
Klans. We shall see a new forward
march of the religion those men repre
sent. We shall see those men wedded
to the great ideals of America. We
shall see the constitution of states and
that of the nation 'exalted, because of
that renewed man who has gone
through the fire as a Klansman and
has sacrificed all to the principles on
which this Protestant Christian nation
is founded—that superstition and ig
norance might perish from the earth,
How Do You Know?
Only Beginning To Grow
WOULD CURB POWER IN
Washington, D. C. —The sixty-day
jail sentence for contempt, imposed
against Comptroller Charles L. Craig
of New York and affirmed by Hie
United States Supreme Court, will
result in a demand at the coming ses
sion of Congress for legislation to
curb the power of federal judges in
contempt cases.
Senator Norris, Republican, mem
ber of the Senate judiciary commit
tee, who formerly was a judge of the
Nebraska state courts, said:
“The almost unlimited power of
federal judges to hold in contempt
persons against whom they may take
offense because of some word or act
displeasing to the court ought to be
curbed.
Walsh Also Favors Move
“In fact, I am strongly for curb
ing the bioad powers of the federal
courts in a great many respects.”
Senator Walsh, Democrat, of Mon
tana, also a member of the Senate
judiciary committee, said he would
favor legislation by Congress to re
quire trial by jury of alleged con
tempts, not committed in the pres
ence of the court. The Craig case is
such an example.
Senator Walsh recalled the fact
that such legislation has been advo
cated from time to time for the past
fifteen years.
He cited House Bill 15,657, before
the Sixty-third Congress in 1914,
which sought to put into effect the
right of trial by jury in cases of in
direct contempt. This bill passed
the House, but died in the Senate.
Demands Trial by Jury
The Senator said:
“I have long contended that in
cases of alleged contempt not com
mitted in the presence of the court,
so as to act as an obstruction to a
trial while in progress, the right of
trial by jury should be accorded. I
shall support legislation to that end.”
. Senator Walsh made a vigorous
speech on the floor of the Senate in
support of the House bill in 1914
when he said:
“It can be easily demonstrated that
such a departure, instead of weaken
ing the administration of justice,
would extend the power and influ
ence of the courts by assuring to
them in greater measure the esteem
of the people invited to co-operate
COLLEGES 'SWARM WITH KLANSMEN,' SAYS
New York. —Astonishing indeed, to
the uninformed was the news which
aelegates brought here to the fif
teenth annual National Inter-Fra
ternity Conference concerning the
swift growth of the Ku Klux Klan
in all American universities and col
leges not dominated by Catholicism
or Jewish influences.
“The Ku Klux Klan,” declared Dr.
Thomas Arkle Clark, dean of the
University of Illinois, in his report
on organizations actively related to
school life, “whatever may be said
for and against it,'is gaining a re
markable foothold in our colleges
both North and South. It must be
given consideration in this confer
ence, in my opinion.”
“Swarming With Klansmen”
* More emphatic still was the state
ment of an lowa delegate. “The
middle West colleges,” he reported,
“are simply swarming with young
Klansmen. They are in every de
partment of university work, and
they usually represent the very best
elements of the student body. As a
result of Klan work among our
young men, we are having a revival
of study of the federal Constitution
and of American history such as I
Have never before known. It is my
sober opinion that this country is
on the verge—if not already enter
ing—the most stupendeuos patriotic
crusade ever marking any nation’s
history.”
More Power Yet Coining to Klan
A college president from a South
ern school, who was at the confer
ence because in New York on busi
ness, and who insisted he spoke
without relation to fraternal bodies,
gave it as his opinion that the en
trance of Ku Klux Klanism into
American colleges is only beginning
to make its power felt. “It is al
most the first attempt in our "na
tional history,” he said, “to interest
young citizenship in good citizenship
outside periods of war. I would not
have believed that the undertaking

“The power to punish for contempt
is said to be ‘arbitrary in its nature.’
“Recognizing the liability of judges
who are only human, there is scarcely
a state in the Union that has not leg

cise of i|.
Argument Was Answered
“The fact is tnat trial by jury in
cases of contempt has long prevailed
in the state of Kentucky.
“There is not an argument that
can be advanced in opposition to
trial by jury in contempt cases that
is not equally an argument against
the jury system as we now know it.
“It has been advanced that Con
gress is without power to make such
provision for the trial of cases of
indirect contempt.
“But that question is set at rest by
the decision of the supreme court in
Ex Parte Robinson (19 Will, 505), a
case in which the famous contempt
statute of 1831 was considered.
“The attack having been made
upon the law as an invasion of the
inherent power of the court, it was
pointed out that the inferior federal
courts are not created by the consti
tution, which simply authorizes Con
gress to establish them.
“Congress can give to them such
jurisdiction within the limit fixed by
the contstitution as it sees fit.”

could be so successful. The colleges
of the Southern states —it is so in
my own school, and other educators
tell the same story—are feeling the
ground swell of Klan enthusiasm.
Our young men talk Klan principles,
shape their reading to conform to
ideals which the Klan has awakened,
and are gradually shaping their
daily acts, especially with respect
to dawning political responsibilities,
to conform to their Klan belief.”
“Patriotism in Action”
The National Inter-Fraternal Con
ference, so far as can be learned,
took no formal action with respect
to outlining the attitude individual
Greek letter societies should assume
toward the Klan.
“It is patriotism in action —pa-
triotism pure and simple,” an officer
of Phi Beta Kappa declared soberly.
“We could no more take unfriendly
action toward the Klan than we could
pass a resolution against the sing
ing of the ‘Star-Spangled Banner,’ or
the practice of saluting the flag. If
politicians and interested newspapers
want to fight Kluxism, they’re wel
come to risk their bones any time
they think it safe. That isn’t what
our Greek fraternities are for, how
ever. This is an American country,
anyway.”
Majority of Students Belong
Discussions of the subject among
students themselves, who were drawn
to the Hotel Pennsylvania where the
conference was held, evoked surpris
ing facts. It was said that a ma
jority of the students of every Pro
testant and state educational institu
ion in Ohio and Indiana are members
of he Klan, if eligible. Texas col
legians are even more strongly rep
resented in the organization. The va
rious state universities, although hav
ing many Jewish students, seem as
well organized by the Klux forces as
are Protestant institutions. Far
Western schools are said to show
like conditions.

TELLS HOW PRESS
You often hear of how accurate
the news dispatches furnished by the
Associated Press are and how any
intimation that some of the dis
patches might be a little doctored or
that certain details are suppressed are
hooted at by the newspapers main
taining this service. In this section
of the state we had a little first
hand knowledge of the Morehouse
affair and were in position to check
up on the “accurate” news sent out
about it. Some of you who heard the
testimony at the recent misdemeanor
trials were no doubt surprised to see
how little of the testimony favorable
to the defendants and “agin” Gov
ernor John M.’s little comedy-drama
was published, and your conviction
that certain news associations were
not always non-partisan were
strengthened.
To date there has been no sena
torial investigation into the attitude
of the Associated Press towards the
K. K. K. f but there has been an in
vestigation along another line that is
enlightening, as witness the follow

How the Press “Educates” the Peo-
ple to Please Chiefs of Big
Business
(Special Correspondence)
Madison Wis. —In the October issue
of LaFollette’s Magazine the follow
ing charge is made: *
“A coal operator appearing before
the Calder committee of the United
States Senate admitted that the ex
tortionate prices charged the Amer
ican people for coal in 1920 may
nave received $600,000,000 in exces
sive profits.
“This is an operators estimate of
what the educational campaign of
.he National Coal Association in 1920
—conducted through the columns of
the daily press—cost the people of
the United States.”
LaFollette’s gives a history of this
educational campaign, based on the
hearings of the Senate committee on
manufactures.
How Newspapers Were Bribed
Early in 1920 the members of the
National Coal Association were fac
ing a most embarrassing situation.
There was a surplus of coal, and the
coal mine owners were in a quan
dary as to how to dispose of it with
out cutting prices.
An advertising fund of $500,000
was raised through an assessment on
the members of tile association, and
the money was spent with daily
newspaper all over the country.
The object of this advertising cam
paign was to convince the people that
there was a shortage of coal instead
of a surplus.
The newspapers not only printed
the advertisements but supported the
claims of the coal mine owners in
their editorial columns.
The Associated Press was induced
to become a party to this effort to
“scare” the people.
Reaching the Associated Press
On that point LaFollette’s quotes
from an address delivered by Francis
S. Peabody, “one of the principal
operators of the country," before a
secret meeting of the National Coal
Association held in Cincinnati. Here
is the story Mr. Peabody told his
fellow coal mine owners:
“After our last directors’ meeting
in Chicago I was able, through my
personal acquaintance and friendship
with Mr. Melville Stone of the As
sociated Press, to get his assistance
in Chicago.
“I called him up while we were
holding our meeting, told him what
we were doing, and asked him, ‘As a
CLEVELAND MAYOR
REFUSES TO HALT
FUNERAL BY KLAN
Cleveland, Ohio. Mayor Kohler
was chatting with other officials in
his office the other day when a very
i-gitated man entered and declared in
a voice trembling with emotion that
he had a duty to perform.
“The Ku Kluxers are going to have
a parade,” he said, almost hysteri
cally.
“What of it?” demanded the may
or. “Let ’em parade as long as they
do no harm. Fm not going to stop
’em.”
“Don’t you realize,” persisted the
informant, “that the Klan is un-
American?”
“I don’t give a whoop. Do you ac
cuse me of being a member of the
Ku Klux Klan?” demanded Kohler
indignantly.
“Well, I can’t prove it,” was the
reply, “but I can tell you that you
ere in sympathy with them.”
“I’ve made my bed,” continued the
mayor, “and I’ll lie in it.”
“You dare not stop the Klan from
parading?”
“I’ll not stop any fraternal orders
as long as they are law-abiding,”
Kohler said. The objector wilted.
Just at this moment the chief of
police entered and the objector turn
ed upon him with the query: “How
about it, Chief? Wouldn’t you stop
a Klan parade?”
“Is there anything wrong about
it?” asked Chief Graul.
The objection appears to have been
based on plans of *Klan members to
attend the funeral of a brother in
full regalia, but the officials said they
were without legal means of pre
venting the parade.
EDUCATES PEOPLE
matter of favor, will you send out
three or four hundred words by
mail, to be released at a certain date
to every daily throughout the United
States taking the Associated Press
service?* He agreed to do so.”
The effort of this story in the As
sociated Press was described by Mr.
Brewstei, another coal mine owner,
who spoke after Mr. Peabody had
concluded. Mr. Brewster said:
“I saw an example of the benefit
of this particular publicity. The
matter that Mr. Peabody had sent
out by the Associated Press appeared
in the St. Louis papers, and each
one of the papers wrote an editorial
on it.
“The next day after these edi
torials appeared five contracts were
delivered to our office which had
been hanging fire. We were stand
ing pat on certain prices, and the
people were inclined to lock horns
with us.
“Those editorials reminded those
particular customers, who had ex
pected a much greater reduction in
the price of coal than we were will
ing to give them, that there was go
ing to be difficulty in getting coal
this winter. ,
“As I -said before, here were five
contracts mailed into the office with
letters stating that they had read his
story in the papers and thought they
had better get back under cover.”
Jenkins’ “Confidential” Story
LaFollette’s also qoutes a letter
from Mr. Jenkins, vice president of
the Hutchinson Coal Co., written in
October of 1920, in which Mr. Jen
kins explains how he “doctored” the
story sent out from Cleveland by the
Associated Press.
The Associated Press carried a
news report of over 1,000 words to
its 3,500 cr more newspaper plants
written by its Cleveland manager
after consultation with the publicity
director.
It is not straining the fact—and
this is imparted in the utmost con
fidence—to say that the Associated
Press story was, to a very large ex
tent, the word-to-word product of
the publicity department.
The great advantage of this re
port from the operators’ viewpoint
lay in the fact that the National
Coal Association nowhere was quot
ed as authority for the Associated
Press making them on its own re
sponsibility.
In this way they were of more
convincing effect than had they been
qualified with the inference of par
tisanship.
Commenting on these revelations,
LaFollette’s Magazine says:
“The people should bear in mind,
however, that while this campaign to
educate them was in progress, and
while they were being urged to buy
coal on account of a shortage, the
shortage reported by the press had
no existence in fact.”
In support of this LaFollette’s
quotes from the report of the Calder
committee on the Senate. This re
port showed that the country had
produced 556,563,000 tons of bitumi
nous coal in 1920, as compared with
458,063,000 in 1919 and that the rail
roads had moved 25 per cent more
coal weekly in 1920 than in 1919.
“So there was no coal shortage or
coal transportation shortage,” de
clared the Calder committee, which,
it will be remembered, was headed
by a stanapat senator from New
York.

Sioux City, lowa.—More than 100
candidates were naturalized by the
local Knights of the Ku Kiux Klan
:n a ceremonial here last Tuesday
evening.
Sioux City Klan is not only step
ping out in membership but is de
veloping along all the lines of fe.low

As a result of the Order’s receni
activities in law enforcement by
bringing about a clean-up of the city,
causing the arrest and conviction of
the head of the local dope ring and
the capture of an escaped criminal
from Waterloo, it has found an in
creasing warm response in the hearts
of Sioux City’s best citizenry.
The local Klan has not forgotten
the fraternity that is to be found in
this union of native-born, gentile
Americans. Already it has an or
chestra and is planning for a band
and educational and literary features
that will further the members with
an outlet for every phase of civic
good and improvement.

And the present would never go by.
For it was but the thought of my
past life
Grown into eternity.
Then I awoke from my timely dream-
And the vision passed away;
And I knew the far-away warning
Was a warning of yesterday;
And I pray that I may not forget it,
In this land before the grave;
That I may not cry out in the future,
And no one come to save.
And so I have learnt a lesson
Which I ought to have known be
fore,
And which, thought I learnt it dream
ing,
I hope to forget no more.
So I sit alone with my conscience,
In the place where the years in
crease,
And I try to remember the future,
In the land where time will cease.
And I know of the future judgment,
How dreadful so e’er it may be,
That to sit alone with my conscience,
Will be judgment enough for me.
