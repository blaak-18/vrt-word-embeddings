GOT SNUBBED ABOUT FOREIGN
MISSIONS.
My Dear Sir: —As I got snubbed in
your defense, I call on you to help me
out. I read your article in a recent
issue of The Jeffersonian, and it set
me a-thinking. Most of us are like
sheep, just follow regardless of right
or reason. At a recent meeting of
the Woman’s Missionary Society, our
president read an article censuring
yon and all such writers, and giving
one the opinion that you were against
almost any good at all. I interrupted
her and said, “1 read that article,
and I don’t think Mr. Watson is op
posed to missions, or any good work,
but simply points out some of our
errors.” Her Serene Highness look
ed at me with contempt and remark
ed, “It couldn’t have been anything
else,’’ and resumed her article.
I wrote her a note afterwards (I
had to leave before the meeting clos
ed), and told her that there was no
need to snub me so mercilessly, be
cause I knew you to be too smart a
man to write things without reason
or foundation, and also that 1 deem
ed “opinions” venerable properties,
and that those showing the most de
crepitude require the gentlest hand
ling, etc. Now she says she will
apologize, and that possibly she
should have taken time to have dis
cussed your article, etc., etc. She
had not read the article, could not
have discussed it if she had read it.
J did not want it discussed there, I
do not want an apology. I just feel
the injustice of reading and accept
ing a one-sided article against other
opinions and being snubbed for try
ing to defend the opinions.
Do 1 make myself plain? Now, if
you will just write a few lines tell
ing me where you are at. I will great
ly appreciate them. Do you believe
in missions. Do you believe in doing
good? Are you trying to break
down or build up? Anything else
you may say to enlighten us as to
your position will be appreciated. It
is so hard to say just what I would.
1 am so in the habit of making state
ments to get another’s opinions, and
ofttimes they are taken as assertions.
1 am not angry, not at all hurt, but
I just don’t like to be beaten. A
prompt reply will be appreciated.
Most respectfully,
MRS. P. N. LOTT.
P. S.—My husband is an admirer
of your writings, and 1 am the moth
er of Mrs. Julian S. Harris, of Dear
ing, Ga., in whose home T often have
read your Magazine.

Answer.
My Dear Mrs. Lott:—Your favor
received. It gives me great pleasure
to state again what I have repeated
ly said in my weekly paper and
monthly magazine, to wit: I am
heartily in favor of Foreign Missions
of the Pauline sort. In other words,
1 believe that we ought to preach the
Gospel, just as Christ commanded;
but 1 do not believe that Christ ever
intended for us to leave hungry,
homeless, illiterate, irreligious people
at home, —whose numbers reach up
into the millions, —while we carry
abroad so much money to furnish
homes, food, clothing, medicine, med
ical attention, surgical attention, free
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
books, free board, and free secular
education to the black children of
Africa, the brown people of India,
and the yellow people of China.
For nearly eighteen hundred and
fifty years missionary work was done
after the example set us by those who
worked and talked with Christ, and
who had the best means of knowing
what He meant when He said, “Go
ye and preach”.
One of the most serious objec
tions to the present plan is, that we
offer to the destitute people in hea
thendom such powerful inducements
to call themselves Christians, that
we have no adequate way of testing
their sincerity. We offer them so
much in the way of material bene
fits, as hereinbefore stated, that the
temptation is simply irresistible to
the poorer classes of foreign coun
tries.
I have tried to do good. I have
tried to expose and to exterminate
what was evil, both in Church and
State. I am doing work on the two
Jeffersonians which is of a home mis
sion character. For this, I get noth,
ing whatever, except the satisfaction
of educating the people and influ
encing public opinion in the right
way. Such reform papers as mine
never pay anything in the way of
clear profits in money. During the
time that I have been engaged in
this editorial work—five years—l
could have made anywhere from $50,-
000 to $1,000,000 practising law and
lecturing. I think your lady friend
will readily agree that this is fairly
good proof that I am in earnest in
trying to get the missionaries to do
for our own people, in America, —for
the destitute widows, and men, too,
for that matter — of our own country,
what they are so eagerly doing for
t’ e destitute foreigners.
Very truly yours,
THOS. E. WATSON.
BAPTISTS, TAKE NOTICE!
Editor Jeffersonian.
Dear Sir and Brother:—The publi
cation of my letter to you in your
weekly has brought on a lot of de
lightful trouble in my workshop.
Letters are coming to me asking
about the General Association which
I mentioned as meeting here at Mag
nolia, Ark., December 15-18, prox.,
desiring information, etc.
If you will kindly allow me space
to do so, I will explain as briefly as
possible to your numerous Baptist
readers, about the Association.
Far over half the Baptist denomi
nation have never supported the Con
vention-board system of foreign
mission work, whose extra-scriptural
methods you have criticised and ex
posed. Over ten thousand churches
in the South do not contribute to it
in any way.
They refuse for two primary rea
sons: First, the boards have estab
lished a complete Episcopal system
rch organization and govern
ment on mission fields, the superin
tendents appointed by the boards ex
ercising all the functions of ruling
bishops over the native churches and
pastors, with the result that the
churches on mission fields are nei
ther independent nor self-supporting,
but remain a burden to the home
Gfya 3tffcrsoniaa
churches and the boards are antag
onizing the Baptist principles of in
dependence and congregational
church government.
Second, Southern Baptists are pay
ing out annually about $125,000 of
their mission funds to support boards
alone. A missionary gets from ten
dollars and up on the home field to
SSOO to S6OO on the foreign field;
but a corresponding secretary gets
$2,000 to $3,500, and the boards
have the power to make as many
secretaries as they like, and they
are making them. In other words,
there is what a writer on political
economy would call “graft.” Besides
these reasons there are many others,
one of which is “money-basis repre
sentation” in the Convention, so the
churches can not reach nor correct
these abuses. Efforts have been
made, both in and out of the Con
vention, to reform these abuses with
out success.
Then there is the “subsidy sys
tem” of hiring natives to preach,
building houses, colleges, schools,
hospitals, dispensaries, and taxing
the churches with a whole system of
education, civilization and benevo
lence, when the command of Christ
makes it our duty to simply preach
the gospel to all the world, and noth
ing more.
For these reasons the churches
which refuse to support such an un
scriptural system, together with
many which formerly did support it,
have formed a General Association,
in which the organization is harmo
nized with Baptist principles of
church independence, and the work
with the command of Christ to preach
the gospel and nothing more. No
body but messengers from the
churches enters this association, and
instead of a board with Episcopal
powers, it has a simple finance com
mittee which receives and forwards
funds for the support of missionaries
who do nothing but preach the gos
pel, organize churches and leave them
free and independent, as did Paul
and Barnabas. They are not run
ning schools, kindergartens, teach
ing dentistry and farming, nor try
ing to make converts by playing
“Poor Kitty” and dispensing “castor
oil.”
This Association embraces churches
in eight States now, with more com
ing, and is supporting Biblical mis
sionaries in Syria, Persia, Mexico,
China and Cuba. Not an officer in
it receives any salary save the treas
urer, who is paid for bookkeeping,
and only $25.00 per month.
It was formed four years ago at
Texarkana, Texas. We can not get
the facts about it before Baptists in
the Convention papers, not even for
advertising rates. The Convention
leaders and managers are fighting it
with might and main. A Populist
could get his evidence and arguments
in Democratic or Republican papers
much easier than an Association
Baptist could get his in a Convention
paper. I know, for I tried it in
Georgia as early as 1896-7, and the
State paper, the Christian Index,
would not print the official record
of the Foreign Mission Board, for
advertising rates.
The next session of the General
Association meets here in Magnolia,
Ark., December 15 to 18. Any Bap
tist church can send messengers, or
they may co-operate in the work by
letter only. It means that the church
es are taking charge of their own
business, harmonizing - their work
with their principles and the Scrip
tures; throwing out the useless
$3,000 middle man and the parasites
which feed and fatten on mission
funds; cutting out subsidy and every
thing save just what the Lord com
manded.
And I am sending this information
to you through The Jeffersonian be
cause I can not get it to you through
your religious (?) denominational
organs.
We have several splendid papers,
through which we are giving infor
mation and carrying forward our
campaign of education and emanci
pation.
The writer publishes a monthly
magazine, “Plain Truth,” thirty-two
pages. The November issue, now
just out, contains an expose of Con
vention Episcopacy, proven by the
official record.
The Baptist Flag, Fulton, Ky., is
a sixteen-page weekly, of large cir
culation and ably edited.
The Arkansas Baptist, Little Rock,
Ark., a very fine sixteen-page week
ly, is making things hum for God
and truth.
The Baptist Echo, Jacksonville,
Texas, is another excellent weekly.
Dr. J. H. Milburn, Union City,
Tenn., has lately issued a book ex
posing the unscriptural system and
graft of the whole Convention sys
tem.
State associations have been form
ed in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas,
Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi,
in harmony with the General Associ
ation.
We shall be sglad to have the
churches send messengers to this
meeting, also to welcome any Bap
tist brother as a visitor who wishes
to see the work of missions placed
on a scriptural basis.
Magnolia is in South Arkansas,
Columbia county, on the La. & N. W.
Railway. Come either via Queen &
Crescent (Southern Railway) through
train from Atlanta, Ga., via Vicks
burg to Gibbsland, La., and there
take La. & N. W. to Magnolia, fifty
three miles; or come via Memphis,
Tenn., and there take the Cotton
Belt to McNeil, Ark., and then La.
& N. W., six miles to Magnolia.
I thank God and take courage
since you have made a highway for
truth to reach the people. I have
prayed and longed for the time!
Twelve years ago I learned the truth
and tried to get it before the denom
ination. The story of the struggle
through the long twelve years would
make volumes. I see light ahead!
God is a deliverer! I believe in Provi
dence; and your editorials and papers
and life are providential, and I be
lieve God has brought you to the
kingdom of free speech and press
for a time like this! And when I
see a horde of ecclesiastical prevari
cators and boodlers just “everlast
ingly skeedaddling down the road,”
and tearing the tall off their long
