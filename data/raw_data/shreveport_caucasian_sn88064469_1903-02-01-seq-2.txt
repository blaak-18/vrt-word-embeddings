San Francisco, Jan. 30.-With his
flesh cut and bruised from beatings he
had received at the hands of his Nica
raguan jailers, George Williams. an
American miner at Corinto, sought
refuge on board the Pacific mail steam
ship City of Panama, which has ar
rived at San Francisco, and was car
ried by her to La Union, Salvador.
Williams had been a prisoner in the
hands of the Nicaraguans three
months and was released at the in
stance of the United States consul gen
eral at Managua.
His arrest, he declared, was a pre
text to enable the Nicaraguan govern
ment to recover a rich gold mine near
San Bernardo and to which he secured
title before Nicaraguans were aware
of the value of the property. Williams
when he left the City of Panama de
clared that within a week he would be
on his way to Guatemala City to lay
the case before the United States min
ister or his representative. He said
he would push the. matter and demand
heavy indemnity from the Nicaraguan
goyernment.

Washington, Jan. 2t.--The gun:' 's
r with which the police department of
11 the District of Columbia supply the
WVhite House are usually faithful and
e discriininating officers. Sometimes
they are a trifle overexacting. The oth
t er day Mrs. Roosevelt was stopped by
Sone of them and compelled to tell who
she was before being allowed to enter
the White House grounds. She had
y been out walking and returned by way
of the entrance to the executive office.
e She wore a brown walking skirt, a
e black jacket and

who had been on
the White House
detail but a few
days, stepped in
front of her and
said conrtco-usly,
but with some
show of author
ity:
"You can't go
'" "oT, cAN'T oo through her e,
THROUGH lut ada m. The
grounds are closed to the public."
Mrs. Roosevelt paused for a moment,
and, looking up pleasantly at the'big
officer, replied:
"I know, but I live here. This is my
home."
Then the officer realized who the
lady was and backed away, with a
stammered apology and a crestfallen
air. The dog looked him over and trot
ted away after his mistress. There
was a worried expression on the offi
cer's face until a veteran guard who
had witnessed the incident came up
and gave hin this reassurance and ad
vice:
"She won't mind, but I'll give you a
pointer.' When you see that dog with
any one, let that person in. That dog
won't go with any one but some mem
ber of the family and won't let any one
else touch him. You can't go wrong it
you keep your eye on the dog."
Uncle Joe Cannon takes especial de
light -in dropping in for an evening's
® chat at the cosy bach
oa t oa elor quarters of Secre
tary Moody of the nta
l vy department Uncle
Joe is a widower.and
t r as rooms at the Coch
ran hotel. Just around
the corner in K street lives Mr. Moody
in a comfortable and commodious resi
dene. With him resides Representa
tive Glllett of Massachusetts.
On i dreary and rainy evening re
cently vMr. `Cannon looked out of his
corner room window in the hotel and
saw a cheerful light gleaming from
the window of the secretary's house.
Thitherward-- he. bled himself and
found the secretary and Mr. Gillett at
dinner, having with them Mr. Gillett's
brother and another visitor from Bos
ta. Having already dined, Uncle Joe
*ee.ined-an ia tiota join the- party
at the board sad, picking up a pack of
eards, passed his waiting time with
Ssolitaire. Presently the dinner party
came out, and the visiting Mr. Gillett
displayed interest in Mr. Cannon's
playing.
"A, ha," .uaid Uncle Joe, "I know
you. Reguar card eye and card sense.
r I understand there Is another brother
of yotuhandy at the game too. Should
,hate to buck up againtst you three in a
game of draw."
Next day in the capitol Mr. Cannon
reumarked to Represen ative Gillett:
"I say, f~id. I'd like to sit in a game
with that -rother of yours. Does he do
anything elSe but play cards?"
- "Oh, yes," was the reply; "when he
isn't playing cards he's a professor of
theology at Harvard."
When Senator Pettus of Alabama,
who is eighty-one 'years of age. an
nounced that he was a candidate for re
election, he had as competitors ex-Gov
ernor Oates, aged sixty-five, and two
other Alabamians, aged respectively
seventy-one and seventy-five. Senator
Pettus won easily.
.After the election ex-Governor Oates
made a -speech at a gathering attended
by all the candidates -
"The trouble with us," said the ex
governor, indicating with a sweep of
his hand the seventy-one and the sev
enty-fve year old candidates. "is that
tha state of Alabama thinks we are too
young to go to the senate."
Dave Lane, the well known Philadel
phia politician, was-in Washington the
-other day and made
-. some characteristie re
marks on lawmaking
and lawmakers, clos
e ' inug with this, narra
tive: "Yes, I still con

governor's office and rame back, and
the chairman marched down in front
of the president's desk and made this
verbal report:
" 'Mr. President. your c-c-committee

and inform him of the itmpending e-nd
of this s-s-session has performed that
office, and the g-g-g-governor sail ,e

A treasury official was Artunate
enough the other day to get a ton of
coal, which was deposited on his side
walk late in the afternoon. .$ colored
man agreed to put it away for a quar
ter. When he had finished the job. se
presented a bill for .50 cents.
"Why, I thought you said a quartet."
queried the officeholder.
"A quarter for putting is in. Out -0
cents extra to pay a man to watch it.
You see. if some one had taken a cou
ple of handfuls you would have lost at
least half a dollar."
Although the very word senator im
plies age. there is nothing t':at so de
. light- the nmmile1rs of
SYouthful. the United States sen
ate asi to be conlsidered
ness of youthful.
Senators I: the nllurs-' of a

the venerale Senllator HIour of M1assa
chulsetts utierl'ed this a lnt,!('nc :
'You. r. . resident. although a
young: lan. enill rioUillbel'."
A smile rippld aould the chambl)er.
The chair was being occupied teImpora
rily by Senator Depew. who Idushed
like a peach as Ihe gla.nttdl from the
playful Massachusetts stat-_imnlan to
where Mr's. Dipew was sitting in the
reserved gallery. After the session the
adolescent Chauncey slapped the juve
nile George Frisbie on the back and
called him "old boy."
In the marble room of the capitol the
other day Senator Morgan of Alabama.
who is nearly seventy, was talking
with a lady caller. The lady was old.
she was plain, and her dress indicated
that she was seeking the aid or influ
ence of the Alahama senator for some
purpose. Directly opposite sat Senator
Spooner of Wisconsin. looking debo
nair, col versing with two young; hand
some and tailor gowned ladies. Pres
ently the callers all departed. The sen
ator from Alabama approached the
senator from Wisconsit.
"You young chaps have the chicks
come to see you, while old men like me
have to be polite to the hens," he said
playfully.
And yet the senior senator from Wis
consin is over sixty years of age.
It has, however, remained for Sena
tor Foraker to especially thrill the sen
ate with joy. He was discussing the
militia bill. and, glancing around the
chamber, with a comprehensive ges
ture, he exclaimed:
"Why, we are all of us-all of us-
subject to militia duty-that is, all who
are under forty-five, as most of us sure
ly are."
Whereupon Senator Platt shook
hands with Senator Depew and Sena
tor Pettus smiled benignly upon Sena
tor Vest. °
Hon. John Franklin Rixey, who rep
resents the Eighth Virginia district,
tells a rather good sto
LiveldirThan ry on one of his copstit
S"arch uants who resides in
the good old town of
ICt Leesburg, which was
the former home of
t Lewis Nixon, the New York shipbuild
er and politician. Now, Leesburg is not
at any time a teeming metropolis, but
it .i a rather lively place on the day on
r which the March term of court begins,
r when the farmters come in frop all over
the Judicial bailiwJck of which it is the
center. They call it "March co't day"
t down in Virginia.
I Last summer Mr. Rixey and his Lees
burg constituent visited New York and
called on Mr. Nixon, who took especial
pains to show them about the metropo
lis. Driving up Broadway, they Igame
to the corner of Twenty-third street,
where the constituent was struck with
amazement by the great throng of peo
ple surging by.
"What's going on, Lewis?" he asked.
"Is there a circus in town or some
thing?"'
"No," said Mr. Nixon: "this is just
the ordinary daily crowd."
"Great guns!" said the Virginia vis
itor. "What must it be on March co't
day?"
Not a little of the time of the senate
has been occupied by Senator Nelson
in opposition to
the omnibus
statehood bill. _____
The other. day *
Senator Q u a y,
who is in charge
of the bill, call
ed for the regu
lar order.
"The chair has
already recog
nized the sena

ident Frye. "He
is the regular
order."
Senator Nel

argument, and
one by one his s
colleagues left
the chamber un
til there were x'cUMBER WOKE WITH
but 'six present.. A START.
One of these was Senator McCumber
of North Dakota. who moved over and
sat in the chair next to Senator Nel
son's desk. McCumber listened atten
tively for a few moments and then
calmly went to sleep.
Senator Nelson talked along and at
one point grew emphatic. McCumber
woke with a start.
