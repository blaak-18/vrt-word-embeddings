Pilfering from Peterto Pay Paul.
The State Funding Board has
tiailhed to tind a Batnk willing to
"'ulvance" the January interest on
our -State credit." The Stock
oardl-dear teader reader may you ner
,ir know what that is--ounds to
their relief: and Mr. Semnunes, the
,,'e,vt lawyer, is eillployed by them
1o tell t he Fluiding Board how, by
liliitri'i "g 'lfron Peter, they may
i,:iy iaul. That the case may lhe
clearly iuiweristool, these are the
flalts.
The present fiscal agent "ad
vanced' the first six months' in
terest, or what is known as the
,l1ul interest, on the State debt
tr Is7S. ()n that "'advance"' lie
has lite himn, anid unire-enlmbursed
et'-;ltllse cillections lare miiostly af
h Ju ./, Q2:.0'!,0t00; which, ofeoirse,
I tis i.'elit wantis returnelld from1 the
clliet io ii as they collie in this
fall, andi which is but fair. But
ianll now mark the climax-it is
dliscnvereldl-in ihet the discovery
is is old as 1876-that if this
a;limount is returned, tlheii tile ill
terlest coupon holders will lie short
ex.ctly tlh;at amnounit; for the col
letl ions, yearly, lack that much of
mleetin g the interest due.
ir'. Semmlles proposes in polnpons
le'al style-as it' pomposity could
cover dishonesty-to select another
fiscal agecnt, who will adtrance the
Jlan uar interest; and that Ice pledge
to hinl all that conmes in onl thetfill
collcctions of interest tax, and let
Mr. Kenniiedy suck his thumb, so
to spleak, tir his 8O230,00 already
Now wee subliiit if this is niot
"''ilfering froml Peter to pay Paul."
Nay, it is the nmerest triting with
a seriouis Imatter. Is not whallt is
owed to Mr. Kennedy, the present
liscal ageit, as sacred and honor
able a deibt as we owe to those
,liuanary coupon clippers? And
Mr. Sennmmes has the audacity to
talk of duty, when he stands up
the lace of day backed by an as.
semlddy of stock broking sharks
who live by their pound of flesh,
and tells Ius it is our "duty" to
steal (we talk plain english) 8230,
000( of honest money borrowed in
good faith ftion an honest mlan
that we may by the act sustain
the "honor of the State."
We tell Mr. Semmlnles for one,
that :tlie honor of Louisiana will
niot he isublnitted to his judgment,
if this be a sanhllle of his qualifica
tions.
T''he FundingBoard hasn't taken
to Mr. Senmnes idea with tlhe alac
rity which his balckers explected.
The plea of a paid lawyer is worth
to thelt as melinl of hlollor as 111i'1h
perhalps,- no more certainly-as
the plaper upon which it is written.
Mr. Selnnies forgets all but his du
ty to his employer, and demniands
their clainls in advance of all
without regardl to the merit of oth
ers equally as good. The Funding
Board owe a duty to the taxpay
er, Mr. Kennedy, who has ad
vanced them money, and to the
coupon holders. They have no
right to play the part of advocates
when they must sit in judgment,
equal and exact, between all, Mr.
Kennedy's money was borrowed
for the paymenlt of interest due
by the State e1st July, 1878, The
thfaith pledged was re-embursement
from the taxes to be collected this
year. That money must be re
turned ftrom those collections. Tihe
honor of the State demands that,
most certainly; and Mr. Semmes
with ail his legal acumen and
sophistry cannot refute it.
What the holders of January
coupons may suffer or do we can
not say;, bit we most positively
protest against the suggestion of
Mr. Semmes to rob Peter in order
that Paul may wax fat.
Charely Howard, so the N. O.
Democrat tells us, has declared
that he will close up that paper,
lock, stock and barrel, in less than
sixty days-or words to that et
- * feet. Charley Howard had better
move up close to some mountain in:
orderthat it'may 'fall upon him,
for we tell him, that his
nearest .and best friend won't
know' him,, or his Lottery,
vben t.tl eneral Assembly of
. vent will take place  
wleekts.
Who Is in Liberty's Interest I
We hear much newspaper and
private talk these days of electing
this or that man to the Senate from
Louisiana, because he is in tavor of
the "Sugar interest !"-the "Levee in
terest," ºr some "Railroad interest" or
other; upon which several "inter
ests,"' itf we admit a tenth of their
logic, these talkers believe hang all
the law and the prophets.
Kenner is the Sugar man; Eustes
the Levee man; but as yet, "Tom
Scott's man" is either too modest to
flaunt his colors, or the "steal" too
palpable "thus early" to admit of
open advocacy to the extent of hing
ing the election of an United States
Senator upon its "merits."
All this, while Louisiana's citizens
are being dragged from their homes
in open mockery of law and insult to
liberty, goes bravely on, and no man
yet appears as a candidate in "Liiber
ty's Interests." Private schemes,
fi.r gain, incite coalations to the end
that a Treasury may he raided; but
poor bruised liberty has not one so
poor as to bemean himself by doing
her reverance.
Now and then some bolder man,
fashioned after our rude forefathers,
speaks out in school in plea of our
strangled rights as citizens.
lie is laughed at for a fool.
This ase is not'cut tolthat cloth.
Well, we suppose that time will
tell if this be the "decay of the Re
public," or the long night of a sick
ening debauch from which she will
slowly, yet surely recover.
In our rural simplicity we are led
to depend on men for much that only
angels could aceomplish. We are
looking for a guardian for liberty
among the noblemen of our common
wealth, when, perhaps, the task we
would call him to is beyond the pow
er of IIerculas.
But still, we ask ; who is in Liber
ty's Interest?
Every one now awaits with pain
fill anxiety the crisis which is up
on our party. It' a Constitutional
Convention is called-say for April
º15th-then we move on to glory.
Ifthlere be no Convention-; if the
legislature goes on to the end o
its sixty days and while wrang
ling over petty laws defeats the
will of the people, salt, aye all in
Liverpool, wouldn't save the dem
ocracy of this State from an ever
lasting, never-to-be-recovered
from defeat.
It would require the cheek of
adamant to defend the action of
º any party in such contingency,
and we are prepared to stand by
and see it unmercifully slaughtered.
Our Local Fina1nces.
.If the matter of paying the January
interest on the State coupons is ex
citing serious comment in New Or
leans and elsewhere, the °likeli-hood
of our parish not being able to meet
her liabilities this year will no doubt
excite corresponding comment at
home. Such, we are sorry to say,
seems, from present indications, to be
the fact. Both conditions, that of the
parish and State, were brought about
by the same agencies; the inability
of the people, or their refusal or ne
glect, which amounts to the same
thing, to pay their taxes.
The sole income of the parish, as
well as the State, is from taxes col
lected from the people-if they pay
it can pay ; if not, then all their credit
falls to the ground. The Police Jury
has been economical even to parsi
mony, and their expenditures have
been guarded and confined strictly to
what was absolutely required.
The estimated collectiuns will not
reach, so we understand, sixty per
cent of the estimates, and this awful
gap of forty per cent stares our paro,
chial finances in the face.
Unless the tax payers respond
promptly-there is no help for the
present condition of affairs.
If we plunder each bank year
ly, in this newly devised scheme,
of $230,000 in order to meet the
interest on our State debt and
"sustain our honor," how long will
it take to get us back to the first
bank we robbed? It should be a
goodly number of years, for these
unkind cuts might make them
quite chary of us.
Indictments Found.
Indictments have been found
against parties in this parish now
under bond in the "Hornshy mat
ter." The U. S. Marshall has been
instructed to notify them to report
in New Orleans on January 3d
inst.
These indictments and arrests
will amount only to harassing,
and are intended but for persecu
tions, no one knows better than
the parties arrested.
They are patriotic gentlemen
and the harassing will not amount
to much.
Thirty of the best. organ makers of
the world are competitors at the
Paris Bxposition. A cable despatch
to the Absociated Press, says two
highest gold medals havebeen award

Tl'he Sricces of Granitisil.
[St. Louis l'ost.]
Flippiancy is not wit. A terse wvId
is not always a true word. ()1Our s
teemed contemporalry. i,,e G!( -Dm
e'rafl miight have thoutlit. ;i ilile I.I,
fore it un ls4itoo i(k to ,y1 that the
lat clha uateristic of G rantisii was
,crcess. No 'resident it the whole
histf our cf our rntry aid I ;' suec,
cessful aidministratioli. All tlhe ire
celing admiiistrations together, froIn
the days of Washington to those of
Lincoln, do not show the extrava- 1
gance, profiligacy, wastefulness, cor
ruption, peculation, defalcations and
dishonor of every deCription for
which Grantisni will ever be k1nown.
If our esteemed contemporary meant
power instead of success, we do not
contradict. Undoubtedly General
Grant had greater power than any I
President who ever preceded him.
But the very magnitude of his po
litical power throws his failure as a
President into more striking light.
Blind, indeed, must be our esteemed
contemporary, if it cannot see that
Grantism represents nothing hut fail
are-failure to his country, failure to
his party, failure to his administra
tion, failure to himself.
He entered the White House with
the reputation of an honest man, and
with the admiration of even the op
position for his manly, military quali
ties. lie left it as the most intimate
personal adherent and friend of no- 1
torious and infamous political con
victs and corruptionists, like Ben
Butler, the Camerons, Robeson, etc.
Was that success ?
HTe entered the White House with
scarcely an organized opposition
against him ; with hardly more than
a rdozen Democratic members of the i
Hlouse, and only half of that in the
Sent:ie. Ile left it with a considera
hle Democratic mnaiority in two suc
ceeding Ilouses elected by the people
in express condemnation of his inal
Sadministration ; with the Senate near
ly in the hands of the Democracy, and
with a popular majority of over a
quarter of a million of all and over a
million of the white voters against
his Administration. Was that a suc
cess ?
He entered the White House with
every Southern State at his feet and
in the hands of the Republican par
ty. Ile left it with every Southern
State in the hands of the Democracy.
Was that success ?
lie entered the White House say
ing, "Let us have peace." When he
left it he had nearly succeeded in
provoking civil war. The South lie
gave up for eight years or as long as
lie could to the misrule of public
plunderers, for which there is no
parallel in history. Was that suc
cess ?
lie entered the White House with
pledges of honesty and economy. He
allowed one corrupt secretary to waste
the stupendous sum of $l82,000,000
for a so-called navy, when Admiral
Porter, appointed by Grant, under
oath said, "Our navy is worse than
no navy at all." Was that success I
IHe entered the White house when
all Europe looked with admiration to
the marvelous power of the great Re
public. He left it when the names of
f Belknap,. Babcock and Butler,
Schenck, Emma Mine, Credit Mobil
ier, Pacific Mail and Black Friday
had brought our country to shame
and contempt abroad. Was this suc
cess?
What does tile Globe-Democrat
mean when it speaks of the success of
Grantism ? Does it mean the success
with which carpet-baggers robbed in
the South, corrupt Cabinet Ministers
in Washington and political rings all
Sover the nation Y Does it mean the
tdepression of business which follow
ed the glory of Grantism ? Does it
mean the five million and a half
which, as another legacy of Grant
ison, we had to pay to England
Sagainst all reason or right. Does it
B mean the inevitable repudiation or
scaling of some of the Southern debt,
also caused by Grantism ? Does it
mean the attempt to make a corrupt
-lobhyist like Landanlet Williams
Chief Justice of the United States?
What dloes our esteemed contempora
ry really mean wheni it speaks of the
S"success of Grantismn ?"
To us it seems that it was success,
ful only in--faiilure.
Card of Thanks

homes to New Orleans. at the de
mand of the infamous Hlornsby,
have 'joined in a card of thanks,
which is but a faint appreciation
of our gratitude, to those gentle
men of the city 'who patriotically
responded to their condition. Gov
ernor Wiltz and Treasurer Burke
were quick to show their patriot.

Zunt (of the City Hotel, and the
proprietors of the St. Charles like

they too were the friends of those
