The School Board met :Monday,
and suspended all public schools
till February 8th, when it will
meet again, and it is to be hoped,
re-open them.
All teachers are required in the
interim to send in their warrants
for collection, so that they may be
audited and show how the school
fund stands--whether or not the
Board is in debt, or how much
money, if any, is on hand. In
other words, the Board wishes to
take stock and find out "where it
is at." The Board elected S. J.
Henry Esq., Secretary and parish
Superintendent, vice T. Norwood
Smith, resigned. Mr. Henry has
held the position before, and gave
general satisfaction, and it is be
lieved that he will do equally as
well again.
