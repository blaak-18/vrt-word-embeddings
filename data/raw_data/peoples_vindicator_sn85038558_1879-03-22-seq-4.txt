Cusnres et rl Extra Selnion on
Thuemsday e
Dr. Wodworth, Surgeon General of
th United Slan Revenue Marine Ser.
ice, is dangerously ill with pneumonia.
The parte who backed the various
jobs that failed in the last Congress an
mean their intention of trying it again
In the extra session. It is expected
that two immense lobbies for the Geneva
ward, that attracted so much attention
during the latter part of the late Con
gress, will be on band during the extra
asesion. One of these lobbies was sent
here by the Inurance companies and the
other by the war premium interest. It
s not at all probable that either party
will seeseed.
The lobby on the ratest bill is also ex
pected to return. The patent bill propo
e to change the entire patent laws in
favor of corporations and against inven
tors. This biloriginated in the Senate
and had a powerfuil outside backing. In
the o nls of experienced members of
kbboth w this bill cannot pass i, its
prieset shape, if at all. It is doubtfl
whether the sugar lobbies can resoper
ate sekiestly to make an effort at the
extra session. The Southern Pacific lob
by, headed by Messrs. Sherrill, Flag and
ete are always on hand, also th. Pa
dile lobb and the Brazilian steamnship
lobby. The former is led by e-Ga*O. 4
BrowU, of Tenueseee, and Capt. Bolnl r,
of 88. els, and the latter by Tisedhl,
sielmes assisted by John Roach, of
sous there are lots of subordists at-s w
tbhed to all reaet lobbes, who sre e
tadued aon small slaries and great ex
poetations. The lobby agents are all op
posed to the rs-election of Randall, on
the ground that he is bitterly opposed to
all their sehemes. They have not yet
pronounced for Blackburn or any one
, b- it mattere very little whose
.a+eP . y espouse, they will have no
infhe.lse. Blackburn rs as much oppos
ed io their schemes as Randall is. There
is also a majority of both houses of the
new Congress agadnst them.
Ex dMoeator altterson, of Sonth Care
in, deates having informed the New
Yor& Asocated Press that be bad ro.
siaed full pardon for his alleged offenses

In the application of the Governor of
Virginia for a writ of mandamn. to con

of that kste, to redeliver to the .'tate

pwers and jnurdlettoo of the Federal
serts everywhere, and not, as was
stated by the New York Associated
Prsi, iho t buth ern States alone. The
