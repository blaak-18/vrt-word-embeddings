The Call (Seattle.)
Hop. A. 1). Willis of New Zealand, a
leading printer of that country and a
memlr of the New Zealand parlia
ment, stopped over night in this city,
homeward bound from England. Mr.
Willis has been absent from home
some months, having been on a busi
ness trip to Germany, England and the
United States. }ie has been inspecting
the latest improved printing and ruling
machinery manufactured within the
three aboq) named countries. It is
needless to say that he has made part
of his purchases from American firms.
From personal appearance one
would. hardly select him as one of the
advisers of the best "poor man's coun
try" in the world. In size he is about
medium, very compactly built, about 45
years old, blue eyes, and wears mut
ton chop whiskers which with his hair
is slightly gray. But speak to him
about the latest work in the art of
printing, or, better still, about the gov
ernment of New Zealand: his eyes will
immediately light up and you will find
that you are in contact with a man
just chuck full of information and en
ergy. When seen at the Hotel But
ler Saturday night by a representa
tive of the Call, he at first declined to
be interviewed, but when assured that
the government of New Zealand had
been much discussed of late in this part
of the world and the readers of the Call
would peruse every word he said with
interest, he finally consented. Said
he:
"In traveling through this country
and Canada I am greatly impressed
with your condition. The fabulous
wealth of some of your corporations
and citizens, while almost In the
shadows of their mansions live people
who have not the bare necessities of
life, are conditions made by legislation.
You made a grave mistake when you
gave so much of your land and other
natural resources to private corpora
tions which have become private mono
polies and w'ho will drain you worse
and worse every year until the end,
which no man fully knows. We made
the same mistake, but years ago
through the teachings of John Bal
lance, discovered it, and now have that
mistake almost rectified. In our coun
try we have two parties, viz: the liber
als and the conservatives. The liber
als are the class who believe in legisla
tion for the benefit of the poor and let
ting the rich take care of themselves,
while the conservatives hang around
the van and shout 'No! no! You'll ruin
the country.' We have killed the mo
nopolles and therefore have no corrup
tion in high places; a dishonest act by a
public officer not having beer seard of ,
for years. The government Jwns and ]
operates both the ralLro . and tele
graph lines, which are run entirely in
the interest of commerce W!th ut profit
to any London or New York aristocrat. i
"The land, too, is practically free I
from the land monopolist, as we have a
graduated land tax law which exempts
homesteads. to a certain number of
acres, from taxation. Every acre, how
ever, above the homestead limit is
taxed sad the larger the holdings the
higher becomes the rate of taxation.
All lands not in use are also taxed
and the government stands ready to
buy land of say character at its as
seesed valuation. It is then cut into
hemusteeis sad sold ar the ame price 1
to say ee who wants to buy, provided I
they )pay per cent per annum, of
which 1 per cent applies to a sinklng
ain and pays the entitre principal in
utifr-three years. The government

the bank or New Zealand. but the gov
ernment immeliately took charge of it
and guaranteed it for 2,)000,000 pounds,
which restored the confidence of the
public and we had no bank failures.
The government is still in possession
and whether it will remain so or not
will be determined at this session of
parliament.
"We have .'optl-,i what we call the
co-operative contract system on all
public works. That is, work to be done
by the government is divided by the
engineer into small contracts, which
are numbered and any one desiring to
work is assigned to one of them. ly
this means a first class workman makes
large wages while a poor workman
makes less. Eight hours constitutes a
day on all public works. Our factories
and business houses are of course run
by private firms. Yes, we have strikes'
occasionally and how to prevent them
is the most knotty problem we have yet
had to solve. We passed a compulsory
arbitration law at the last session but
whether that will solve the problem it
is too soon to decide. We have an
excellent public school system with
compulsory attendance for all children
under 15. They are exclusively secular,
no religion of whateoever nature is al
lowed to be taught in them. All busi
ness houses are obliged to remain closed
during Sunday and all labor must cease.
One is, however, allowed to do whatever
else he pleases whether it be to attend
church, attend a place of amusement,
or play games of any nature. Besides
this we have a law, which is strictly en
forced, compelling the city and town
governments to select one day out of
the six others on which all business is
suspended at 1 p. m., except that on
this day the saloons may remain open,
provided they sell nothing that inter
feres with the business of houses that
are closed.
"Strange to say, the liberals are the
protective tariff party in our country,
while the conservatives want free trade.
This is due to the fact that the con
servative party is largely made up of
the owners of sheep ranges, who export
the most of their products and conse
quently want to "buy abroad at lower
rates. Any one who desires to leave
his district before an election may de
posit his ballot, sealed in an envelope,
with the proper officer who shall turn it
over to the election officers on election
day, when It shall be cast and counted
with the others. No ship is allowed to
leave port without a full crew as re
quired by law, and the berths must be
of sufficient width to be comfortable.
We also have a w'.nan's suffrage law
which went into e&lect at the last elec
tion. It proved cery satisfactory. We
now have the most perfect criminal code
in the world, and justice as adminis
tered by our courts is quick and cer
tain.
"At the next session I think that we
will adopt a system of consols, some
Sthing similar to the French system,
which will keep money home, instead
of going to England for all our money.
Our surplus this year will be more than
380,000 pounds, which is remarkable,
considering that all other nations are
having such deficits.
"Like your country, we have but few
liberal papers, the larger papers find
more money in supporting the monopo
listic party. The general tendency of
our legislation is toward single tax."
Mr. Willis left Sunday for San Fran
cisco, where he will take passage for

The sub-treasury plan of the Farm
ers' Alliance has received the scorn and
ridicule of every politician and cross
road demagogue in the United States.
It provided that the farmers might
have the privilege of storing their
grain and farm produce in a govern
ment warehouse and borrow money on
the warehouse receipts; and thus be
enabled to hold their grain until a fair
price could be obtained for IL This
was "lanacy." But hold. After it Is
sold at less than cost of production, and
the farmer went home to freese, and
lose his home under a mortgage fore
closure, his crops get into the hands
the whisky trust Ninety million b -
oias annually are used in this way,
eonough to load 250,000 freight cars and
making one continuous railway train
over 1,583 miles long. And after this
crop is turned Into hell-Juice to poison
-men with and turn the world intta
pandemonium of crime and woe, the
govwernment lets the whisky trust store
its said hell-fjuice in a warehouse and
there take care of it for the trust for
nine years, allowing the hell-Juie to
go untaxesd all that time until it gets
god and hellish!

T' he recent dispatches from 11 ash
Si!ngton in the ,Journal were rather
s n.'nsational: showing that the gold
s indLcate is at work quietly to do
what the demonetization of silter
a ave tihefI the power to do- corner
oid. The buying up at a premium
of toeir ti gold from the mines will
mance them ready for the new loan
that the treasury shortage makes
t incvtable.
in this whole gold matter-or the
loan --tho Journal has held to the
t theory of conspiracy to force a loan

r I~iiroi. -, are loaded down so that
most of thern are in the hands of re
ceivers. 'The conspiracy was that for
 success the men behind ('leveland
- agreed tnat such loan should be the
price.
As soon as the extra session was
called to repeal the Sherman act, the
1 organs of the president demanded at
once the authorization of a 00'i0.U) J.
4,) gold loan, and on congress refus
g in the loan was made over the heads
of congress by a forced construction
of an old statute-and D3i, ).)0,,PPr
already borrowed. Yet even this
seems insuflicient to wake up some
Ipeople to the fact that there is and
v.as an understanding that amounts
in o;!.cial action to a conspliracy to
get tiihese loans from the treasury for
a favored few in the world of money.
It anything was needed to make
this plain. it is in the unprecedented
fact in the history of civilization, of a
Scontract with private parties to give
t them control for a term of months of
P the national treasury, and an option
p on any loans to be made subsequent
to the contract. The contract runs
to next October-five months yet
and with a deticit of #50,0!U,P000 now
before the treasury, not only that,
but possibly a hundred million added,
will be needed. The syndicate seems
to be getting ready, and to make
sure of being able not only to meet
the demand, but to keep others out,
is buying up the gold of the mines in
advance. And the cry is, when too
late, that the treasury is at the
mercy of the contractors.
But how can they buy up gold at a
premium and loan it to the govern
uent at ;J per cent interest? The
last loan cost them 104l , and they
have been selling the bonds at 1214-
17 cents protit. Gold at !1 cents an
ounce premium is nothing like a mar
gin of 17 cents on the dollar on bonds.
And what for? To force the coun
try to a gold basis and fund the $50J,
oU),000) outstanding treasury notes
into gold bonds. Such a spectacle as
this presents of the treasury openly
looted by contract is enough to make
the very stones cry out against the
infamy of such a humiliation to a
great nation.-Kansas City Journal.
