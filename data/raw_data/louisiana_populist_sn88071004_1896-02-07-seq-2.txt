A HAfPPY FAMILY.
Sugar-planters, Repubbeas and Discontents, are forced to join the P yulists against the cor
ruaptible and corrupting MURPHY J.-N. O. City Item.
ruptible and corrupting MP1RPllY J.--N. 0. City Item.
* "Peps m Top."
Thi was the slogan that went
forth from the Democratic dailies
and weekles in South Louisiana
and Noew Orleans, when the Sugar
planters and old-line Republicans
indorsed the Populist ticket last
week.
In this sectio of the State the
little "oeor bos" dailies and Demo
ratio weekms gravely samored us
that the Republianas sad old time
Badleas were la the saddle, that
the "nigger was in the woodpile"
N, asnd that white supremacy
that dear old Democratic frmd
was actually in danger.
Now why should the Demoo*atic
party in this iatns, as ain a
others, sing di[ereat songs in dif
reaat loesalm I
Its tsly: the dear rank and
le any party is always honest,
while the aity, m.sly laders are
the oay dlhmnsteaIks.

By the courtesy of the N. 0.
Daily Item, we are able to present
our readers with a cartoon which
appeared in that paper on Tuesday,
the 98th ult.
This cartoon pietures the politi
cal situation in this State brought
about by Murphy J. Foster, the
great political schemer and har
moniserr.
Said Foster has harmonised the
heretofore discordant factions of
his party by driving out the Farm
er's Alliance, the Ballot reformers,
the t agar-planters, and the Silver
Demoorats, and bashing together
the city boodlers, the Court-house
riagters, and all others who are
in politics so~1y for spoils.
Said Foster has also harmonimed
the diferent elements opposed to
ham, by pursuing a policy of hoes
ism sad ring rule, balot-hbo stat
1ag and debauchery of the courts,
wMbch has forced his opponmets to
gather for mutual self defense.

I. The People's party refused all
It ofters of fusion in this campaign,
b and defeated Mr. Pugh, the fusion
, Republican nominee.
Mr. A. B. Booth is the only
- Populist that advocated the fusion,
it and consequent indorsement of Mr.
e Pugh at the State Convention.
- His mistakes confused our conve.
tion, and throwod part of its work
. on the State Central Committee:

i of the Sugar-planters and Repub
y licans, the State Central Commit
r tee went stLaight to its duty and
r named its ticket suitable to our
e platform ead the exigencies of this
e campiga.
The Sugar-planters proved them
i selves honest anad patriotic by in
o dorming this Populist ticket, rather
than help Foster by putting anoth
- er ticket in the Seld.
G, ov. Foster and his agents were
- in the city during the Sugar-p t
er's morention, doing what they
Scoul to stir up strife and pat s
Sother ticket out.
