SATURDAY, JULY 17, 1897. ful :

One of the chief matters that the dire
recent-reunion of the U. C. V. was pari
-called pon to act was the question G
of devising means whereby the pres- welc
--eat war histories should be revised cent
and the inaccuracies therein taken at N
out. It is about time that the peo- patr
ple of -the North -and South should
look at this question in a dispas- of ti
sionate manner and that the South- peat
rnem patriots should cease to be of -s1
called' "traitors and rebels," while a
Sat the same time the youth of the iz6d
South should not be taught that the be t
NortheO armies were composed f y
partly of mercenaries, recently im- th
ported Germans and other for- can
-eigners. The recommendations and ans
suggestions of the committee o the on
U. C. V. on school historillre we
patriotic and broad, and the sooner
the educators of both sections will .
cease their petty animosities, the the
-better it will prove for the Union. eral
Let
T. L. Dulany Esq., of the Iberia gori
bar, has addressed a letter to the and
members of the bar throughout the the
-country parishes, in which he ad- the
vocates holding a convention in the salt
-near future of the lawyers of the ftag
State in the view of taking sys- the
tematic steps toward remodelling m
the judiciary of the State. He the
purposes doing this through the lel
constitutional convention, and takes het
the initiative in inaugurating a hol
general movement throughout -the
-State with that aim in view. A pli
meeting of the lawyers of -Iberia has Lo
already been held and the other tic
parishes have been asked" to do do
-likewise. We think Mr. Dulany's An
stand is well advised and should be ic
encouraged. Some features of the kn
judicial system are sorely in need of no
remodelling and Mr. Dulany should up
be commended in the step he has fo
taken. Concerted and organized po
action is always successful and it is be
not too soon for the lawyers to act tal
if they wish to help in this good l
cause.
The Bay State has a superfluity th
of old maids and the problem of he
their proper disposition is agitating all
-its lawmakers. It has 7o,781 more bi
women than men, says the Times- W
Democrat, and that good paper, pc
always chasitable and an earnest at
worker to alleviate the sufferings of o0
mankind, this time proposes a plan da
by which the prayer of 7o,78r old v
maids will be answered and their dt
dreams realized, by advocating the ta
"colonization" of the old-maid nt
colony to the State of Washington sc
where, it appears, there is a cor- s<
-responding majority of men who ti
have not yet assumed the garb of ai
happy Benedicts. It appears that ri
the sweet old maids object severely o
to a hfe of old maidism and would h
prefer Mormonism to it, and were a
it not for that fact, we would with .
considerable trepidation agree to re
the plan proposed by the Times- r
Democrat, but as it is, it would un- s
doubtedly be both charitable and t
wise to "colonize" them in the
wilds of Washington State, where c
instead of reading Ibsen and
Robert Browning and petting their
z6th feline, they will have to "hew
wood and-draw water" for their new
lords.
-St. Mary can well be proud of
her assessor. The gouthern Pacific
has property in that parish in the
shape of town lots, bridges, etc.,
on which heretofore there has been
no taxation. Mr. Marsh, the as
sessor, seeing no reason in
the world why that property
should be exempt from taxation,
very wisely assessed it as he would
any body's else, and as a conse
quence the Southern Pacific Com
pany protested before -the Police
Jury. The Police Jury, acting as
-a Board of Reviewers, very prop
erly .refused to entertain the objec
tion on the ground that the com
pany had failed to appear be
iore the assessor within the
time advertised by him for
-,~ Ala .r"cva of coP"Paints
:We'believe the asseusor is perfectly C
right, surely from a standpoint In
of equity. The company has .also to h
denied the authority of the assessor carry
in so doing and claims that the dang
Railroad Commission has sole pecia
authority instead, and that its both
property should be assessed by WI
' bulk and not item by item. We reac
- congratulate St. Mary on her faith- that
ful officer and are glad to see a "gut
general movement in the same selve
e direction throughout the other ing
.s parishes of the State. pour

The Baton Rouge Advocate com-dew
A plains that some of the papers of
as Louisiana are objecting to the poli- rigl
icr ticians being sent to the constitu- we
do tional convention as delegates. It wo
is assuredly a fact, and the Daily
y's American is one of those who ob
be ject. The Advocate does not
the know why politicians are persona fin
of non grata. Our opposition is based in
Ad upon the fact that the, very best Di
men of Louisiana are not to be
nas found in the ranks of the pot-house wil
ed politicians; and that none but the an
is best men, the best brains, the best ph
act talent of the State should be em- co
Pod ployed in drafting the new constitu- set
tion.-Lake Charles American.
We would think our brother of sul
city the American perfectly correct if Di
of he were right in his supposition that of
ing all politicians are *"pot-house" ones, th
ore but it is there he falls into error. ge
ies- Why should there not be good ha
)er, politicians as there are good lawyers so
test and ministers? We are as much
of opposed to the sending of corrupt Ci
Plan delegates to the constitutional con
old vention and believe as the American tr
heir does, that only the best brains and
the talent of the State should draft the
laid new constitution, and for-that rea
;ton son we would not object to seeing Jt
cor- some of the better class of poli- ce
who ticians employed in its drafting,
of and we can say with perfect truth p
that right here that some of the papers r
rely of the State that are continually
)uld howling against the "politicians" S
rere are sometimes found supporting '
with -men of the worst class, who pose as I
to reformers. We believe that men L
nes- representing the different profes- re
un- sions and trades should be sent to
and the convention and at the same time 14
the we cannot see why any one would
here object to the election of public
and men, so-called "politicians."

t In these latter days there -seems
to have broken out a mania for..
r carrying a pistol or s4ome other ii
dangerous and deadly weapon, es
pecially among the younger class of I
s both white and colored.

- that to be men they must have a
a "gun" in order to protect them- fc
e .selves from some fancied foe lurk
r ing around some corner ready to
pounce upon them aLthey pass.
This habit has been discussed
and has been attributed to the
cheapness of pistols and the only
remedy is to impose a high tax on
the manufacturers of arms and then
the price of all arms would
tf be so high that the hoodlum
d istic white boy and the ignorant
P "nigger" could not afford to pur
~ chase a pistol at so high a price.
tt The Gazette is pleased to note that
the municipal and parish officials F
is are waging a vigorous warfare
y against that class who are contin
ually carrying concealed weapons. with
d Within the last month the munici- ssr
e pal officials have arrested not less in E
is than fifteen violators of the ordi
- nance relative to carrying con
d cealed weapons. And it is the in
t. tention of the officers of Lafayette
e. city and parish to completely crush In
e this growing habit and all are by ls
