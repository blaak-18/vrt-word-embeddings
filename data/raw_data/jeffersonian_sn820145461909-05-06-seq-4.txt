J ummary of Ebents as They Happen

Judge William M. Hart has over
ruled the motion for a new trial
in the ease of Duncan
B. and Robin Cooper,
recently convicted of the
murder of ex-Sonator E.
The Cooper
Case.
W. Carmack, and sentenced to twenty
years each in the penitentiary. At
torneys for the Coopers will take an
appeal to the Supreme Court as a.
last resort to save their clients, but
it looks now as though the stripes
would go on these murderers despite
their political pull.
Apparently, the law will have to
do something to save its own dignity
as it is said that ten murders have
been committed in Davidson County
since the beginning of the Cooper
trial, making 29 murder trials now
on the criminal docket. Consider
ing that Nashville is the education
al center of Tennessee, the epidem
ic of homicides in that section, riv
aling those of the notorious Breat
hitt County Kentucky, where peo
ple live pretty close to Nature and
trouble themselves little over the
three R’s, is difficult to explain.
It is reported that E. H. Har
riman has “instructed counsel to
devise means of merg-
New York Central
lines into one $1,000,-
000,000 corporation
with a central man-

agemen t and one treasury.” The
lines included in this merger would
be, New York Central, West Shore,
Lake (Shore, Lake Shore and Mich
igan, Southern, Cleveland, Cincin
nati, Chicago and St. Louis, Pitts
burg and Lake Erie, Lake Erie
and Western and the Canadian
Southern.
Commenting on this merger, the
Birmingham Age-Herald says:
‘‘The Harriman scheme to put
all the New York Central lines into
one corporation having a total out
put of securities amounting to
$997,000,000 would throw the
Pennsylvania railroad system with
its 11,000 miles of track in a doz
en states into second place. The
New York Central lines consist of
12,000 miles of track.
“In the civil war days the coun-
try was startled by Commodore
Vanderbilt’s $50,000,000 consolidation
scheme in New York Central lines —•
more startled than it is today Har
riman’s billion-dollar scheme. So long
as he is the monopolist and leader Mr.
Harriman is convinced railroad mer
gers cannot be carried too far. How
he can consolidate 20 railroads without
including parallel and competing lines
it is not easy to see. He will, how
ever, attempt it and the legality of the
consolidation will have to be deter
mined in the courts.
“Where is this sort of thing to end?..
Is there to be ia Hill-Harriman merger
extending from ocean to ocean? Or
is all this merger business a stepping
stone to that other spectre—govern
ment ownership? It is a big problem
in a big country.”
No, trust the specter of govern
ment ownership may not grow worse.
What the people want is not control
of the arteries of civilization, but rob
bery by private individuals, with con
tinual, ineffectual and expensive liti
gation attendant thereupon. They
want railroads built by the issuance
of bonds that will levy a tax upon
generations yet unborn and they want
to pay dividends, through the sweat
of their brow, upon every dollar of
fictitious capital the railroads may
choose to claim as investment. They
want things so arranged that any
effort toward equitable rates will
cause a howl to go up as to the poor
railroad employees reduced wages or
lost jobs. In fact, any form of slav
ery, oppression and taxation instead
of the “specter” of common sense

the throne of the Ottoman
empire. The Constitutionalists are in
complete control of the European side
of the Bosporus, and comparative
quiet has been restored, after much
fighting in Constantinople. Many con
spirators have been sentenced, or put
to death, by the Young Turks for
complicity in the uprising against the
new constitutional regime, and Abdul
Hamid may be tried upon the same
charge. It is said he has been de
ported to Turkey in Asia, where he
will remain a prisoner under heavy
guard henceforth. Although rumor
has reported him killed several times,
it is probable that the Young Turks
party intend to deal with him after
Western ideas of justice, which would
not tolerate the torture and dismem
berment no one can doubt but that
the Sultan would administer to them,
if he had been successful in over
throwing their power.
Moslem atrocities continued about
Adana and Tarsus, with a wave of
fanaticism involving region after re
gion. European intervention may
aoolish these horrors, but the jeal
ousy of the powers is such that no
effectual action seems ever to be
taken. Massacre has followed massa
cre for many years, and still to
scratch the Turk is to find the Tartar
and arouse the blood-dust in him which
spares neither age nor sex.
As for the United iStates, what a
proud position it occupies emploring
England and France and any old
country to look after American citi
zens, while its battleships are now
at rest from that many-million dollar
voyage!! Not a single ship available
for quick action —one boat, we believe,
steaming to Mersina from a Cuban
port, and due at destination a week
or so after the other countries have
intervened, or the victims have all
been slain. The gentleman of con-
spicuous military ability, and
whose giant intellect conceived the
stupendously valuable project of
forcing naval officers to do 90 miles
horseback stunts, and pie-baking
and carpentry, and other things es
pecially appertaining to naval effi
ciency, of course is absent from
home. But it was his particular
plan to spend millions of public
funds on an absolutely worthless
piece of naval vainglory, and his
bosom should swell with pride to
think how boldly the fleet sailed in
time of peace, and how safely en
sconced it is in port at the critical
juncture. All of which goes to
show what brilliant men are in
charge of the vast appropriations
squeezed from the public. If a
navy has any excuse for being at
all, it is to exercise police power,
where the lives of American citi
zens are endangered through riot
and revolution in foreign lands.
A fleet of ships unable to stir from
port for a week or ten days after
things have happened is about as
valuable as so much junk. The
great world-war will never trans
pire, but the skirmish, here and
there, is pretty certain to occur
every little while in some quarter
of the globe.
