frssing that hI' hal k;lled live wonii'.:1
Albert A. Knapp admitted he had re
peatedly assaulted wnrnen criminaliy7
and killed some of them. lle said h,
met the Littleman child In the lim.
ber yard and assaulted her and rhok
ed her to death when she made an out
cry.
He said: "I went to the room with
the Eckert girl. sat down with her and
assaulted her. She cried and I strango
led her with a towel and hurried from
the house.
"I was mad at my wife, Jennie ton
nons Knapp, when I killed her. We
were walking along Liberty street. I
got her down under the bridge on a
pretext and choked her to death I
deny that I poisoned her. I never told
anyone I did. After she was dead I
threw the body into the canal.
"Ida Gebhart I killed, but my metr
ory is not clear as to what I did.
"I cannot tell EWhat made me 1:.11
thesb people. I could not help it. Some
kind of a desire to kill took hold of
me and I could not resist the tempta
tion to kill. I am sorry for my crimea:
but now I hope they will be easy with
me."
After the confessions a formal cha' gnt
of murder in the first degree was filed.
Knapp talks much of the Pearl
Bryan murder and is afraid of being
lynched. He does not want to be taken
from the county jail.
Until prevented by his attorneys it
is expected that Knapp will make
further ;onfessions. He is now sus
pected of strang.ing three women at
Evansville, Ind.. and to have assault
ed and killed women elsewhere. He
was in the Cincinnati house of refugei
when seventeen years of age and L.aw
records are being discovered almost
hourly.
Says He Is fatiane.
Cincinnati, Feb. 2?.--The parents of
Knapp said Albert was insane and his
confession should not he believed.
They believed he would I.e better
dead. Mrs. Sadie Wenzel, his sister,
said her brother, when five years of
age, was kicked- by a colt at Twenty
Milq Prairie, Ills., and lat ar struck by
lIghtng at Terre Haute and but for
her parents she would bhvo had him
audeaded inmane.

Here are nrsome gofis of epigram
culled from h)ooks of tli hour:
Popularity-it is a shladow! Turn
your eyes toward It, and it shall ever
ru"n before you, scaplling you. Turn
your back upon It, walk religiously to
ward the living sun, and it shall fol.
low you.--Jerome K. Jerome int raul
KrI: ver."
'I'here is no fatalism like that of the
Indlfferent man who believes in ngth'
Ing, not eVeil in himself, and who ad*
mltis nothing to hie pl)Oitive( except
crime a nd dishonlor.- Manrion.rawford
In "(ecilia."
The only ghosts, S believe, who creep
into this world are diead yo)lng moth
ers, returned to see how their children
fare. There is no other ibducement
great enough to bring the departed
back.-.Jamnes M. lBarrie in "The Little
White IBird."
Good humor is a form of tenderness.
Those who are easy to laugh are like
wise ready to be sorTy. And they
have a fund of sympathy to draw on
whenever the necessity arises.--el
Chandler Harris in "Gabriel Tolliver."
I tell you the fascination of this pit
gambling is something no one who
hasn't experienced it can have any
conception of. I believe it is worse
than liquor, worse than morphine.
Once you get into it it grips yop and
draws you and draws you, and the
nearer you get to the end the easier it
seems to win, till all of a sudden, ah,
there's the whirlpooll-Frank Norris
in "The Pit."
Don't you go an' git sorry fer yer
self. That's one thing I can't stand
in nobody. There's always lots of oth
er folks you kin be sorry fer 'stid of
,yerself. Ain't you proud you ain't got
a harellp? Why, that one thought Ii
enough to keep me from ever gittia'
sorry fer myself.-Alice Caldwell Hi
gan in "Iovey Mary."
If you can't be really happy, preten8
that you are happy, and the first thing
you know it will be a reality.-Joel
Chandler Harris in "Gabriel Tolliver."
From Washington comes a stor)
about James Whltcomb Riley which
may or may not be true, but which Is
worth the telling. It is to the effect
that Billy Ethell, a capitol attach4
has recently received a letter from the
poet of all Hoosierdom. Ethell says
that he and Riley are old chums and
that years ago they both worked to
gether for an Indiana sign painter.
"Jim has money in his pocket now,"
says Ethell. "He told me once that
some day he would be rich and that
when he came into his own he intend
ed to carry money in every pocket, .ust
to see how good it felt. I met him in
Indianapolis a touple of years ageo and
reminded him of his prediction.
"'Well, it came true.' said Jim,
reaching for his pockets. He brought
out bills from each pocket in his over
coat and then fished down into his
coat and vest and ,brought out more
bills from every pocket. Then his
hands dived into his trousers, and he
hauled out silver and small bills from
both sides and from his pistol pockets.
Finally he went into his watch pocket
and brought out a $5 goldpiece.
"'There you are,' he said trium
phantly. 'I have got money in every
pocket.' "
Philip Verrill Mighela whose novel,
"The Inevitable," has been attracting
attention, says that while in London
engaged upon the original draft of his
novel he found himself at last so haunt
ed by neglected duties that he took a
day in which to attend to many small
affairs of business. It was summer.
After a long and trying ordeal Mr.
Mighels arrived at his home late in the
afternoon weary and disgusted.
"I went to my agent's and then tp
see Mrs. Blank's solicitor and then tb
the offices of ive different editors and
finally to see my publisher," he said.
"The agent is on the continent, the
lawyer hadn't shown up all day at his
office, two of the editors are ill, one is
on his vacation, and the remaining two
could not be found, while the publisher
has moved I don't know where. I
stopped for a minute at Goldsmith's
grave. Of all the persons I called upon
all day Goldsmith was the only one
'who was in."
Authors need not be discouraged
when they compare the possible results
of their labors with those of business
men. General Lew Wallace has built a
huge modern apartment house in In
dianapolis solely out of the proceeds of
his novel '"The Prince of India." And
it is well known that the popular suc
cess of the latter has not equaled that
of the perennial "Ben-Hur." It is quite
probable that "Iin-Hur" has supplied
the wherewithal for a number of apart
ment houses.

Tennyson and Truth.
One of the pleasantest things that
Tennyson's niece has to say of him is
this: "I think no man that ever lived
eame nearer than he did to perfect
truthfulness. He was often a martyr
to his determination never to say any
thing that was not strictly and abso
lutely tile, for none could be more
sensitive than he was about paining
people, and yet he would discard all
smooth speeches that would have given
pleasure, but would not have been
quite sincere, and would just say right
out the wholesome, though sometimes
unpalatable, truth instead, feeling utter
ly miserable for days afterward, with
