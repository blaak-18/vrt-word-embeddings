One of the Old Guard Gone
Rev. Thomas Wadsworth was born
in Lawrence county, Indiana, on June
30, 1828, and died November 14, 1908,
aged eighty years, four months and
fourteen days. The Wadsworths of
Revolutionary days were his ances
tors.
He was married on April 12, 1850,
to Elizabeth J. Odell, who died De
cember 26, 1868. He was married
on January 2, 1870, to Sarah J. Kil
lion, who survives him.
He was the father of eleven chil
dren, six of whom are living. Those
living are six sons —Emsley and Wil
liam H., of Worthington, Indiana; P.
R., of Washington, Indiana; James
L., of Indian Springs, Indiana, and
Thomas G. and Bloomer A., of Ra
glesville, Indiana. He was the grand
father of thirty-five grandchildren,
twenty-nine of whom are living, and
the great-grandfather of seven great
grandchildren, all of whom are living.
He was an active member of the
Methodist Episcopal church during
the greater part of his life, and was
a minister in this church for about
fifty years. He was noted for his
zealousness in Church work and. his
strong faith in the Christian religion.
A favorite text used by him, often,
was: “Christ is all and in all.”
With the thought expressed by these
words, as a central thought, he pre
sented in strong and argumentative
language the fullness and complete
of the atonement of Jesus Christ for
the saving of all who accepted
Christ’s teachings.
He was a strong partisan in the
sense that he always had positive
viws on the issues before the people
on matters of importance to the State
and to the nation. His first vote for
President of the United States was
cast in 1852 for Franklin Pierce, the
Democratic candidate, and against
General Scott, the Whig candidate.
When the Republican party was or
ganized in 1854, he became a member
of that party and afterwards sup
ported Fremont, Lincoln, Grant,
Hayes, Garfield, Blaine and Harri
son for the Presidency. Believing
that the conditions of the country
were such as to demand the organi
zation of a new partv, he became one
of the leaders of the Populist party
and promoted its organ'zation
throughout the St'te and nation. He
was the candidate of this party, in
1896, for Governor of Indiana. He
was a creat admirer of Thomas Wat
son, of Georgia, and of Judge Samuel
Williams, of Indiana, and assisted in
naming them to lead their party in
the recent national election.
When the civil war broke out in
1861 he took his stand promptly and
with all the power of his then vigor
ous manhood, in favor of the preser
vation of ,the Union of the States.
Moved by the great crisis that meant
the dissolution of the Union unless
great sacrifices were made he offered
the best days of his life to his coun
try. Not only did he offer himself,
but he went out and urged and plead
ed with others and recruited men for
the war. In the organization of the
troops with whom he went out they
became a part of the 91st regiment
of Indiana infantry. He, with many
of his neighbors, were assigned to
Blje □effersontan
Company “C” of which he was elect
ed first lieutenant. The late Starlin
Sims was the second lieutenant. Cap
tain Zimri Garten, of Odon, Indiana,
was captain of this company.
With our thoughts on the life of
the deceased we see him connected
prominently in the Church, in war
and in the affairs of his country. And
through all, as well as in the other
affairs of life, we see him, in our
mind’s eye, standing like the oak of
the forest, like a giant for the posi
tions taken by him. He never ear
ned a flag of truce or harbored a
thought of surrender. He thought,
he considered, he deliberated, aijd
then formed his conclusions. With
his mind made up as to what he
thought was right, he then asserted
himself and took his stand. Inspir
ing his friends and associates, he
talked nothing but success, victory.
If he did not prevail it was not for
want of firmness and a steadfast de
termination.
His relatives and intimate friends
have noticed, during the last year or
two, that he was breaking down. But
he was not the kind of a man to give
up. He gave attention to the usual
affairs of hfe until four weeks ago
last Saturday, when he found it im
possible to hold out longer. Then it
was that he said to the members of
his family at home that it was his
belief that he could not live long. He
grew worse gradually. During the
last few days of his life his widow
and all of his six sons have been at
his bedside. Nothing possible to do
for him was left undone. But it was
plain that with him “life’s fitful
fever” was over. And, at 10:20, on
last Saturday morning he died. There
was no apparent pain or suffering.
The vital organs of his body were
apparently performing their proper
functions, and no particular reasons
appeared for impending death.
When the great war Governor of
Indiana, Oliver P. Morton, was dying
he looked at those that stood around
him and said: “I am worn out.” And
as it was with the great Morton, so
it was with the body before us. With
the breaking of his giant frame was
the flickering of his strong mind and
with the failure of both, the light of
his earthly career went out forever.
After March 5, 1909, Theodore
Roosevelt will be associated with the
editorial staff of The Outlook. Ev
erybody should be pleased to learn
that he need not join the great “army
of the unemployed,” and doubtless
his apprehensions as to how he would
provide for himself and family are
somewhat allayed.
