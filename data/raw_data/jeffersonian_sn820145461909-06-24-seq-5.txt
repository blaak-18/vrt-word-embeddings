“Evil is wrought by want of thought,
As much as want of heart.”
THIS old couplet forcibly recurs
when one thinks of the piti
ful fatalities of the Memphis
reunion.
That the South loves these old sol
diers with a tenderness that deepens
as each year thins the ranks of the
boys who wore the gray, is beyond
question. That the treatment ac
corded the veterans at every Reunion
of late years has left something to be
desired cannot be gainsayed.
This is simply due to lack of
thoughtfulness. I am sure there is
not a city in which any Reunion is
held that has not an abundance of
vehicles that would gladly be loaned
for the purpose of sparing these fee
ble old men the hardship and the
danger of a long, wearisome march
under the blazing rays of a Southern
sun.
Time was, when they stopped nei
ther for cold nor heat, nor hunger
nor illness, nor bare and bleeding
feet. But that was in the Sixties.
Nearly half a century has passed
since that time and these white
haired men have marched enough.
Many, indeed, cannot participate in
the parades, because they realize
their feebleness. The others, with
indomitable will-power, are deter
mined to march one more time at
least, and in Memphis last week sev
eral of these heroes never rose from
that march.
Not in a spirit of officiousness, not
to emphasize to these Veterans their
weakening power, but as an honor
earned time after time, they should
ride in carriages and receive the
homage and applause so gladly ac
corded them. It should be a matter
of patriotic duty to see that each
Veteran is well cared for. He is
away from home. It was never his
spirit to complain, but he is going
down the hill now and the journey
should be prolonged, should be made
easy by every tender consideration
generous hearts could suggest.
With no desire to say anything dis
paraging of anybody, carriages filled
with young girls and women should
not be followed by these aged and
crippled Veterans sinking under the
heat and burden of the day. It is
well to have the young people. A
reunion would not sound the right
note if the women and the girls and
the young men did not fully partici
pate in the patriotic inspiration of
the occasion, but the point is, pro
vision must be made for all, or fail
ing that, let the Veterans come first.
There is not a private citizen or
hardly a business concern that would
not gladly turn over automobiles,
carriages, buggies and wagons to the
use of the Veterans, and for the time
being, patronize the street cars, or
walk.
It is to be hoped that the next re
union will be mindful of this and
see to it that all the Veterans, as a
tribute of honor to them, have car
riages. Even those who are hale and
strong and want to march might be
persuaded, as a matter of considera
tion to their comrades not so sturdy,
to ride, and let all enjoy the reunion
Under the Vine and Fig Tree
without any saddening thought other
than is inevitable from knowing that
the ranks are closing up, each year,
to hide the gaps the Reaper makes.
The old guard will not fie with us
always. While they yet are spared,
no social functions or honors or com
forts to any other visitors during
any reunion should take precedence
over the entertainment in every re
spect of that distinguished remnant
which, in the flesh, makes nearer
and dearer the story of the Lost
Cause than will any marble mnnii
ments that may be erected to its
glory and in commemoration of
those who sacrificed their all for its
sake.
THE HANDICAPPED COMPLE
MENT OF MAN.
In the breeding of animals—say
race horses for example—it is not
enough that the male be swift,
strong, of great endurance, sure
footed and possessed of all the qual
ities of the racer.
Such an animal, to reproduce his
like, is bred to a female of equally
fine qualities.
In plants we have even developed
the science of development, of evo
lution. So with animals horses,
dogs, cows, chickens, etc.
Who shall say, in the face of the
evidence, that man is above this iron
law of nature?
It explains the “black-sheep” and
the genius, brothers.
The work and toil and self-devel
opment which a sturdy father and
excellent mother have had in their
lives crops out in the man who makes
millions think, or who makes mil
lions of dollars; or who endows the
human race with an invention worth
countless millions.
The self-indulgence of a successful
great man, wedding a woman of
means, idleness and freedom from
sordid care and (consequently) sym
pathies, likewise accounts for the off
spring of the great man, who, in one
son, shows the elements of the great
ness of his father and in another sou
astounds the world by his utter tri
flingness and sometimes criminality.
It is hard to trace these laws, as
they work out in human beings, for
we students of them live but one
generation; and, then, the students
have not that large liberty of ex
perimentation which they exercise in
breeding dogs, cattle, horses and
plants. But it is desperately cer
tain to cold logic and the coldest
hard sense that the laws exist and
rule.
This byway of preface to a word
or two on the treatment we are ac
cording womankind even in this ad
vanced day of light and civilization.
The other day I saw a little girl
of fourteen tossing a baseball with
all the grace, ease, accuracy, lithe
strength and naturalness of a boy.
So pronounced was her skill that my
companion remarked it and said:
“Why is it that a girl can never
throw like a man?”
Just as he said this, a dignified
Jeffersonian
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
dame, powdered and bescented with
delicate perfume, fat from over
feeding, rustling in irreproachable
silk, who had lifted her lorgnette to
regard the little miss, remarked to
the woman walking with her, a tall,
lank anaemic, “How very undignified
and wrong!”
“Ah, there’s your answer,” I said
quickly to my friend. “A girl can
never throw like a boy because Stu
pidity, the worst form of inertia,
stands against her throwing at all;
and back of Stupidity and lending it
due reverence is that famous old Ty
rant Custom, the bulwark of all the
fools alive, the rote-book of every
unitiative ass that ever went about
in human skin!”
In “Don Juan” Byron says: “Man
to man so oft unjust is always so to
woman! ”
How remorsely and cruelly true
this is!
Who has not heard some little las
sie, imprisoned by her sex at some
time say, with all the earnestness of
her soul: “I wish I were a boy!”
Who has not heard a woman in de
spair at the thralldom of sex’ lim
itations wail: “I wish I were a
man!” In every mood, grave, gay,
or resentful, like the girl resting on
her plough ip the “Prophet of the
Great Smoky Mountains”—in every
mood and with every variety of im
pulse, we have heard them wail or
shriek or earnestly pray this.
I have never heard a man say he
wishes he were a woman!
From the cradle to the grave, un
der the most fool conventions, we
imprison the mothers of the human
race.
We laugh at the Chinese for im
prisoning the feet of their women to
keep them small and yet we imprison
the souls of our women.
If we stopped honestly to ask our
selves a solid reason—one for ten
thousand of the indecorous things
forbidden by convention, by habit of
thought, we could not answer one!
The culminating stupidity is reach
ed when we hold that that red-nosed
corrupt bummer there is fit to vote,
to have a voice in government; and
that sweet mother there is not!
Why?
He wears breeches and she wears
dresses!
Marvelously substantial reason!
Can Bedlam beat it?
There is one truth, however,
which, thank God, we may always
tie to.
Evolution corrects all stupidities.
Nothing lives in convention or in
life whch has not a reason for liv
ing.
One after another, the dear stu
pidities of the world, through all
their vast circle, wither and die.
As man advances, human liberty
opens like a rose.
As man advances, the position of
woman is advanced from its sham
queenly slavery to its free queenli
ness —that of the human being
whom we adore and, adoring, are
willing to accord everything, trust
ing to the laws of nature itself for
her own wise selection. —The Harle
quin.
HOT CHEESE SANDWICHES.
A good way to use up dry cheese,
either American, pineapple or Edam.
The last two grate down to the very
rind and are excellent for seasoning.
Slice bread that is a day old, thin
and cut into rounds. Spread the
rounds thickly with cheese, flavor
with salt, cayenne and just a touch
of Worcestershire sauce. Press two
layers together with the cheese be
tween. Have butter melted in youi'
blazer, or if you like olive oil use
that instead of butter. Fry the
cheese sandwiches golden brown, first
on one side, then on the other, and
serve piping hot on hot plates. Cof
fee, ale or beer should accompany
these sandwiches.
Don’t forget to mention the Jef
fersonian when you answer an ad
vertisement.
