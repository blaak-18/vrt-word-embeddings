could mil give them up without eu

a pair of suspenders in the whole
party. Three wore cowhide bro
galls, without stockings ; the others
were baretooted. All were greatly
alaruieil at the action of the justice.
They loudly proclaimed their itino
eoneo, and begged to be let. oil.
"Compose yourselves, gentle
men," said Mr. S. "You no* not

WUICRtS TIIK BLACK MAN COM 1,8 IN.
The justice was warming up, The
negroes, lookeil as though they
wanted to know all about it before
they were sworn in.
"How much you gwine to git for
dis_Mih job,.ludgo !" asked another
of the incipient, jur^ men.
"The law allows me ten dollars,"
said Mr. Sutton. "But that has
nothing to do with your duties ill
the case. Your course is explicitly
laid down by the law."
The negroes conferred together
for a few moments. Justico Sutlon
was hccotntug impatient when one
ol t hem stepped over the corpse and
asked him "wliar de cullered man
'came in ?"
"What do you mean V asked the
astounded civil oUlcer. *
"De law done gwute for to drop

ieut negro. "What de law done
gwine for to drop for we?"

The negroes eyed him .is if medi

"Hold up your right hands,"
thumicrcy his honor.
SWORN IN—TIIK HATTERT.
The«*olore«| men hesitated. Then
one black liaml was slowly raised in
the air. The others followed it lik«
the dumb blackbirds of a shooting
gallery. The Justice refloated tin
oath, but his hearers remained
dumb.
"Say w«> do," he shouted.
"We «I«»," eehoetl (lie negroo*.
"Lower your hands,"commanded
tlm .hist ice, ami the black birds
dropped from their perches. The
jury then s«piatt«>d upon the furze
about the dead man. They w«to
cowed, but not convinced that eve
ry thing was right. 0
"Gentlemen," spoke th«^ .îustiei»
alter all ha«l sipiutted, "you are
now sworn to perform Ihe functions
ot the law. 'I'he law is explieit in
its definition ot the duties ot a «'or

however, rcipiirew that yon shall

1 lie w itnessos were then pr«»duced
Their evidence was very clear.—
Kphraim had gone into the water
with the intention «d making an
Inmost dollar by «living for I'arson
Itlack's tools. While his compati
ions watolu'd him from the bank of
the stream h«< sank and was not
soon again until his body was grap
pled and drawn ashore. The jury
eagerly listened to all that was said,
but ask«'<l no«|uostioiis. They wore
«'vidontly afraid of the Justice, and
loidu'd upon «lie whole thing as a
sort of Youdou ceremony. His
Honor summed up by saying:—
"Geutlcuieii, you will now retire,
and after carefully weighing the
testimony return with a verdict."
THE JOLI.Y MOORING IJIUPS.
The jury withdrew to the scrub.
Their voices were soon heard above
the music of the mockingbirds who
had gathered hi the tre «'s about

hot dispute, and the birds seemed
to be enjoying the sc, cue. in a few

TIIK LAST VKItPICT.
The terrified jury walked back
to the scrub, and the jolly mocking
birds greeted them with a new
Hood of melody. They wer«» «»ut
nearly twenty minutes. Justice
Sutton, bo«ik and pencil iu hand,
impatiently wait«>il their return.
The weather was hot, and the ne
»groes came out of the brush wit'i
streaming laces. They had a hard
time. Tlicy brought iu the follow
ing vordii't. :
"D«< cullered man am ilea«!. His
name it am Kphraim Jenkins. The

If the poles of a magnetic battery

excited. ;
"D— n your stupid Bonis," lu

crab that was big enough to catch
a nigger?"
"Holeon, ilali, Judge," broke in
one of the jurymen. "Dat ar am

honor. "I said cramps. Getaway

The colored men sloped, and Sut

tine the clergyman t«»n dollars for
dropping the tools in the river,

Up to this hour they firmly be

The Alexandria C&nennian tparos
a little time from it« d«3voted tendons
to polities to ngitntö a question
groat importance to tho residual«
the Uod Kiver volley, namely : .Tel
egri.pic coitiruuuicaliou from Alexan
dria lo iiuyou Sin», Nntchoz,
Shroveport.* The need of a telegraph
is greatly f«lf, in tho lower parishes
and if eoi^tu uniçatiou could bo
tabbwhod froiu here through Mans
field, l'lcnyjiut Hill, Nuti'hi'ochfs,
Cloutior ville, to Alexandria, planters
nnd merchants in Ihe ddTei'ent par
ish«)8 would be greatly bnnelited and
the trade of Sbreveport would
unsiilcrnbly increased. Last winter
t wo telegraph operators started from
hei'o on a prospectiug tour through
tho lower parishes lo ßud out what
support would be given lliem in or
ganizing and eoiiBtructing'a telegraph
line, hut from the hour they left here
until the present time nothing has
been heard of them or their prcject.
Tho Caucasian says that, a year
two ago tho Western Union Tele
graph Company offered) very favora
ble terms, and will probably renew
them. Fifteen hundred dollars from
tho city of Alexandria, to bo leluud
ed in telegraphing, with fAibscrip
lions from Mauwljrld, Natchitoches
and Nhroveport, will meet, about half
the amount. ne«»dod by tho companv
to complote tho route. The Cauca
sian further says that the Western
Union Telegraph Company offered
to bear half Ihe cost and Alexandria
to meet the other half which was lo
bo returned in telegrams. This is
liberal offer and one which it is to be
hoped will bo renewed. The mer
cantile community of Hhroveport is
fully alive to the advantages to be*
derived fmni telegraphic communi
cation with the lower parishes and
tiie increased business—especially in
time of low water—which will turn
this way, and every support, and en
eotirng, ment, can be relied upon from
Sbreveport. At tho present time bus
in «'ss is «bill and money very scarce
what funds nre to bo found have
been gathered together for tlio im
provement of our streets and roads,
but no «lidietllty will bo «^xporieneed
in making arrangements with the
company to commence work at once
so that, tin* linos may bo in working
>rder by tho liino tho fall trade com
mences. The merchants of Shrove
port can always be relied on to fur
nihli their quota toward any project
of a progressive and remunerative
character, and with the co-operation
of other places along the linn of route
no reason exists for any further de
lay. If the parly or parties to whom
the offer was made by the telegraph
company a year ago, will resume ne
gotiations we have every reason to
believe that Ihe Shrevoport and Al
exandria Telegraph Company will
soon be a fact and not a paper pro
ject. Co-operation, gentlemen, is all
that is needed to ensure suoeees.
