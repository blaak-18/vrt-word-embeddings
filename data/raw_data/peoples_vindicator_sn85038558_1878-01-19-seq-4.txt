THE LEADERS AT EL PASO.
Judge Howard and the Mob,
San Antonio Herald.
With the death of Judge Howard
we presume will end the trouble and
slanghter of men which for the last
two months has kept the El Paso
country in a state of feverish excite
ment. Judge Charles Howard was
well known in this city, having resi
ded here and practiced law several
years, a short time previous to his
appointment by Gov. Coke, as Dis
trict Judge of the El Paso District.
He was scarcely more than thirty
years of age when he met his violent
death, having been 'only abont twen
ty-seven years of age when he re.
ceived his judicial appointment. He
was a very bold and daring man, and
reckless in his course.
Mr. Geo. B. Simpleman, of Austin,
the father-in.-law of Judge Howard.
located several salt lakes lying at
the foot of the Guadalupe mountains,
in El Paso county, and obtained pos
session o,f others that had been loca
ted by S. A. Mavericli. These lakes
are very valuable, antd for a lo-n
time the people of El Paso county
(most of whom are Mexicans) had i
been taking and selling salt from them I
at will. After their location Judge 1
Howard, as the agent of Mr. Simile
man, notified the people that no more
salt could be taken from the hikes ex
cept with his permission, at the sane
time offering the same price per fMne
ga (we quote now from Judge ll.'s
statement made immediately after his
release by the mob,) for freight thait
they had formerly received for sale
of salt. The Mexican population of
El Paso county refused to freight the
salt for Judge Hotward, and said that
they had been advised by Louis Car
dts that the lakes belonged to them.
Thus things continued for several
months. Afterwards a few of the
people agreed to freight salt for him,
and he had about one hundred fane
as brought in by El Paso county
freighters. This exasperated the re
maining portion of the Mexican popn
lation, and trhey again consulted Car
" dis, who advised thenm that they (1
owned the lakes and shioul go in a t
body and take possession of theni. l1
Many, especially of the people of the c
towns of Sucorrlo ansd San Elizario, e
threatened to do this. Hearing of t'
these threats Judge Hloward, who !
was about starting for Fort Davis, 'I
made complaint before the county
judge that certain persons (naming 0
thelm) were threatening to take salt n
from the hikes without authority and i
by violence, and asked that they be ti
put nnder bond that they would not %
interfere'with the lakes, and also asl, a
ed that the lakes be put under the
charge of the sheritff Two Mexicav a
were arrested upon this charge, and tº
one of them denied any Intentionlof k,
interfering with the lakes, and wnas
discharged, while the other was plac- 1,
ed under a bond. About that time sI
Judlge Howard started to Fort D:.vis, k
and, anticipating violence at the tc
hands of the Mexicans, made it con- m
venient to stay all night with Sheliff c
Kerber, of El Paso county, that lie tr
might have his protection. Early ha
next morning the house of the sheriff at
was nsurrounded by forty or fifty Mex- hr
ican-, and Howar nd land McBride were
made prisoners. They were dragged ai
along the street, amid the jeers anld ti,
insults of the angry mnob, until they d
reached the horses prepared fir them, of
and then earried by force to San Eli
znrio. Ou reaching this place, Judget
Howard was taken to the hosea of a
Mexican, and kept in a house three
days and nights, at all times sur
rounded by three or four hundred
Mexicais, raging and raving and
crying for his life's blood. A Mexican cc
priest interposed his kind offices to
protect the unfortunate man's lifet
and by his strennous efforts prevailedt
upon the maddened crowd to spare
his life. They would not coneont to ii
this until they had forced Juilge H. ed
to subscribe to certain conditions, te
which they had prepared in writing.
For two days Judge Honward refiused
to subsctibe to the conditions, but on
the third day, finding that there was
no assistance that could be had to ca
save his life, and that the mob was
growing more angry and ferocious,
ie signed a dlocument written in of
Spanish, purporting to be an agree- m
-ont between C. H1. Howard and the ie
people, in which Howard bound Mi
himself : i
1. Not to prosecute any person who
had taken part in imprisoning him,
and to always remain in perfect peace stt
with El Paso county in general. ful
2. That lie would leave the salt ph
lakes free, as they were before, and an
permit the people to take salt f'rom usi
them at liberty. the
3. That he would leave El Paso in
county and not return. tie
4. That he would give bond for the -
faithfutl compliance with the agree
-onet.
5. That he eofeses that the prose- col
cution which he had commenced tf
against some of the people was on- f
jast and without cause, and that they Tb
iad just cause to raise against him, th
and that he voluntarily signed the cal
agreement. he
Judge Howard left the conunty, but e
disregarding his promise, never to re
ture, as it was exacted of him under
duress, he went back to El Paso na L
short time afterwards and encounter- a .
ed the Hon. Lewia Cardis on the nex
street, and in a fight with pistols, ig
shot and killed his antagonist. The the
Hon. Lewis Cardle was an Italian, the
born at the base of the Alps, and bou
had served while young as a captain rew
under Garibaldi. When Judge How- the
ard first went to El Paso they became pail
warm personal friends, but the love of abil
role and political leadership was too free
atrong in the boson of each to peromit my
l:ber to hold undisputed sopremacy ter
in peace over the maude minds of the for
people about them. tive

re- \e often wonder :why farmers in
n- this country do n:ot use the cart more;
Car". it is far more handy for loading and t
they duanpitg manure, soil, roots, etc., t
is a than a wagon, being more easy to
rent. load, and especially to unload. A
the catt can be quickly loaded and dump
mo, ed, and only requires one good horse
of to draw it. In England carts are
who in constant use, being very popular
mis, in the harvest-field. We are glad to
toy see that duping wagons are employed
uing on many of our farms. This loading
salt manure fino a barn-yard, and haul
and ing it by wagon a few hundred yards,
v be to be unloaded forkful by forkful, is a
not waste of time and labor, of both man B
1sl. and beast.-Rural World.
the The signs of a good-working ox L
;avA are; long head, broad and level be
and tween the eyes, and the eyes full,
IIof keen and pleasant ; forward legs
was straight; toes straight forward ; hoofs `
ac- broad not peaked; and the distance
ime short between the ankle and the B'
vis, knee; these properties enable an ox
the to travel on bard roads; if the ani
on" mal turns his toes out, the strain
'iff comes on the inside claw, and when
he traveling on haid ground lie will get
trl Ilame at the joint between the hoofs
riff and the hair. Full breast; straight
ex- back; round ribs, prjectlrng ;,iit as
e'r wide as the hip bones; these are the
ged signs of strength and good constitu
utd tion. The best colors are brown, G]
