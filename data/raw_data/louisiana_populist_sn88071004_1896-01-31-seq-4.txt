Senator Mitchell of Otson, the oth
er day, on the floor of the senate dem
onstrated to a certainty that one of our
troubles requiring us to export such
vast quantities of gold grew out of the
fact that under the Wilson bill we
have been compelled to import $100,
000,000 worth of free wool that would
have gone to our own producers of that
article but for the diplomatic policy of
protecting foreign wool growers, in
btead of our own.

Their h s Weas a Emon.
Four little children have started ou
the long journey from California to
New York alone. Their father and
mother recently died and they are
going east to be adopted. The oldest
of the children is Charles Ashren, 11
years old. His sister, Dora, is 9, and
George and Harry, his younger broth
ers, are aged respectively 7 and 8.
They are all in good health and form
an interesting group. Their father
was a Mason and the Masonio lodge at
Auburn is looking out for the welfare
of the children. The Southern Pa
cific's physicians at Los Angeles, Tuc
son, El Paso, San Antonio and New
Orleans have been notified to meet the
young travelers at their respective cit
ies and pee if they need any medical
attention. When the children reach
New Orleans they will be given a cabin
on one of the steamers for New York.
The conductors of trains between Au
burn and New Orleans have been noto
fled to pay particular attention to the
children, and to summon medical aid
at any point, if necessary, especially in
view of the tender age of Harry, the
3-year-old voyager.
The Sunaower Is till n It.
The western farmer who becomes
disgusted with corn and wheat raising,
because of the low ma~kets for his
products, can turn his attention, as in
Russia, to sunflower raising. One
acre of sunflowers will yield quite a
large number of cords of good fuel,
besides the seed, which has an impor
tant commercial value for eattle feed.
Instead of allowing Oscar Wilde, the
apostle of the sunflower, to go to seed
in an English prison, to prove that he
has slande$ed some queer English so
ciety, it would be a good idea to bea
ish him to Russia, where he could go
into the sunflower business and be of
some service to the state.

Chicago should be the most popular
city on earth during leap year. A
Chicago paper says in that city the re
cent census showed 38,967 more adult
males than females. There is not only
an excess of men in Chicago, but there
is an excess of adults over minors
amounting to 250,430. Think of it,
girls!
In Algeria there is a river of ink.
In the upper palt of its course it flows

black ink. I

Cance(
Of the Breast.
Mr. A. H. Crausby, of 158 Kerr St.,
Memphis, Tenn., says that his wife
paid no attention to a small lump which
appeared in her breast, but it soon de
veloped into a cancer of the worst type,
and notwithstanding the treatment of
the best physicians, it continued to
spread and grow rapidly, eating two
holes in her breast. The doctors
soon pronounced
her incurable. A
celebrated New York
specialist then treat
ed her, but she con
tinued to grow worse
and when informed
that both her aunt
and grandmother had
died from cancer he
/ pCc~gave the case up as
hopeless.
Someone then re
commended S.S.S.
and though little hope remained, she
begun it, and an improvement was no
ticed. The cancer commenced to heal and
when she had taken several bottles it
disappeared entirely, and although sev
eral years have elapsed, not a sign of
the disease has ever returned.
A Real Blood Remedy.
S.S.S. (guaranteed purely vegetablr)
is a real blood remedy, and never fails
to cure Cancer, Eczema, Rheumatism
Scrofula, or any other blood disease.
