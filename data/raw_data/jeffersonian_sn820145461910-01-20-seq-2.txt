PAGE TWO
THE TIME-LIMIT LAW
Dear Sir: —In your December is
sue Mr. Tom Dolan, under the cap
tion of “Labor’s Mistake,” makes
some remarks touching the ten-hour
a-day labor law for women, with
which I beg to take issue. After
first stating that “The public good is
supreme to any law, and where the
so-called contractual right is sub
versive of the public weal it must, in
time, be abolished” —a statement the
first part of which is almost axiomat
ic in its truth and incontrovertible
verity—he yet goes on to say:
“Nevertheless, with all tenderness
and sympathy for shop girls and fac
tory women and the slaves in the
sweatshop, we must recognize the
hard facts of life and realize that not
these alone are the sufferers. We have
the vast army of overworked women
in the home and on the farm, do
mestic slaves who know neither a
ten-hour day nor a sixteen-hour day,
but who are called upon at all hours
of the twenty-four for devoted serv
ice to their families. There is no
organization or possibility of the for
mation of a society of overworked
wives, or oppressed domestic serv
ants,” etc.
It is a fact, I believe, that will be
recognized by even the most un
initiated of men concerning women’s
personal trials and experiences in the
business world, as compared with
those of the home, that, in the first
place, woman’s relation to her
“boss” in business is quite different
from that toward her father or her
husband in the home, as also a fact
that the concern felt by her em
ployer for her welfare can never
equal that of the normal husband or
father. The instinct of the latter
would be to protect from excessive
labor. Being a woman and having
both worked at home and been em
ployed for a number of years “down
town” in the business section of
some of our large cities, I claim the
right to speak with some authority
concerning the difference between
the conditions and circumstances of
the woman having the privilege of
her own home and the woman whom
hard necessity has forced into the
workshop or the business office.
Having reinforced my experience
with abundant observation, I claim
to be doubly equipped. Let us first
examine into the circumstances of
the woman of the home. She is
practically her own boss when it
comes to just how much she shall do,
or what, or just when she shall rest.
Happy is her lot, for she has no au
tocratic boss near by to superintend
and to oversee, to see that she puts
in her full quota of nine or ten hours
without stopping for even five or
ten minutes’ rest. In fact, it is at
her discretion, in case of headache or
indisposition, to lie down or to rest
during the day. No fear of “loss of
job” ever crosses her mind, even
though the sickness should be pro
longed. In fact, no normal husband
or natural father would have his
wife or his daughter to overwork
herself, and would only consent to it
in a case of emergency, as of sick
ness of a member of the family. Con
sequently, if the woman of the home
overworks herself, except in case of ex
traordinary emergency, it is her own
fault. It is not necessary to prepare
an elaborate dinner when one is not
well, when, in fact, a simple one
would do as well. And it would be
the height of folly to consume all
one’s latent energy in the vain at
tempt to keep the house and the
children looking neat as a pin, and,
perchance, to keep late hours making
elaborate dresses for their adorn
ment, and, as a consequence perma
nently wreck health that was al
ready on the wane. Spare your pity,
my brother, on such cases. A wo
man should have more sense, and if
she voluntarily and unnecessarily
overw’ork herself, it is her own fault.
But what about the woman of the
workshop or the office? What lib
erty of action has she? Driven by
dire necessity, as she generally is,
to earn her own living, she is gen
erally compelled to accept conditions
offered her, or else lose her job. She
can not afford to starve. She has,
on the average, a nine-hour day,
and, except in rare cases, is expected
to work without break or rest dur
ing that period, save only for a short
half-hour or hour for lunch. In the
congested conditions of the modern
day business world, in opr cities,
speed is the paramount requirement,
so she is generally expected to
“rush” all through the day. Any
person who has had the opportunity
for extended observation knows the
above to be true; also, any one who
has had any extended experience
knows something of the effect which
this continual rushing business has
on the nervous system, when pur
sued daily for any length of time.
Ask any reputable physician. And
now—oh, horror of horrors —after
well-nigh exhausting her strength
and energy by working unintermit
tently through the long hours of the
day, she is required, after a brief in
terval of half an hour for supper, to
repeat the same work and at about
the same schedule for three or four
hours more. If she refuses, she may
lose her job, for does not her em
ployer tell her that people are walk
ing the streets begging for work,
who would be glad to have her job?
Poor girl! she shudders as she
thinks of what might be the conse
quences should she lose her job and
be a long time in finding another;
she dares not refuse, but, steeling
her heart and nerves to the task, she
goes on night after night for a long
period. And, oh, she is so tired all
the time—not with the fatigue of
health, but with the tired feeling
that never gets rested. She feels
her strength gradually ebbing away,
but all she can tell her employer is,
she is tired almost to death. But in
vain she remonstrates with the
“boss.” Are not all the rest tired?
Finally, she breaks down complete
ly, unable to keep up the struggle
longer. The doctors say she has
nerve fatigue. She is forced to
abandon her work for a term of
months. Reader, this is no fancy
sketch, but one which actually oc
curred, to the writer’s certain knowl
edge.
Zsl>e "Jeffersonian
There is an old proverb in which
there is quite a kernel of truth, to
wit: “Change of occupation is rest.”
And therein lies the housekeeper’s
advantage over her business sister,
for the work of the housekeeper does
not consist in doing one. and the
same thing all the time (as is the
case in business), but is varied. It
is a well-known fact that continuous
repetition of the same thing, without
break or rest, is a great strain on
the nervous system. And though the
“hours” of the housewife may be
long, she frequently interrupts them,
not only with periods of rest, but
with visits to neighbors and friends
at an hour when the working girl is
too busy to spend five minutes in
conversation with her best friend.
Does the business woman ever get
the chance for the recreation of a
visit during the day?
Said Nelson Sizer, the noted phre
nologist and physiologist: “Among
the various essentials to health sleep
is the very first. A man can live longer
without eating that he can without
sleeping,” etc. There is no doubt but
that many of our workers are not al
lowed time for sufficient sleep, not
to speak of time for rest and recrea
tion. After working all day and into
the night until nine or ten p. m.,
returning to work at the usual time
next day, how can they? No won
der the worker gradually weakens as
the days goes by. No wonder the
vitality of our women is oftentimes
reduced to its lowest ebb. Farmers,
as a class, are said to be the longest
lived of our citizens. And why?
Because, in addition to getting
plenty of fresh air and sunshine
(which the office man or woman
doesn’t get), he also takes plenty of
time for sleep. No wonder he be
comes vigorous, while they, in time,
become enervated.
Another good reason for the expe
diency of the time-limit law is the
opportunity thereby afforded for giv
ing work to the unemployed who
need it and who are seeking it, often
times vainly, because of the fact that
many of the employed are wearing
their lives away over the night lamp,
and gradually sinking— sinking—in
to premature graves! Is this what
you call constitutional liberty (!)
for the employed? And has the un
employed man or woman no right to
be given an opportunity to earn an
honest living? And what is the
probable ultimate destiny of this un
fortunate part of humanity who can
not get work? They must either be
a burden on relatives, many of
whom are but poorly paid, tramp
over the country and beg, steal for a
living, or else go to the poorhouse.
Os the numerous tramps who infest
our land, did all of them go to that
from choice? And what about the
burglars who parade our streets of
nights? Are they all employed men?
This brings to mind the old adage,
“Satan finds some mischief still for
idle hands to do.” I fear the time is
coming when it will be necessary to
limit by law not only the hours of
women employees, but those of men
as well, not alone for their own pro
tection, but for the good of the State,
for unless some of this overtime
work is cut out and the work more
equitably distributed, we are liable
to have such a condition of affairs
as confronts England today, with its
vast army of unemployed. Even
now our poorhouses in the cities are
overcrowded, some of them being in
shameful need of additions or en
largement. Are they not filled with
wornout wrecks of humanity—
wretches who could not get steady
work at living pay? And, methinks,
in the not far-distant future, their
ranks shall be replenished from
among the business wrecks strewn
broadcast over this land—women
who gave up their health in doing
overtime work!
MAUD RICHARDS.
Answer.
Mr. Dolan reports that he is in
terested, but still unconvinced that
the home-staying woman is the in
dependent creature of luxury de
picted. The husband and father is
often very unobservant of the wife’s
weariness and of the millions of
steps that must be taken to keep
the home comfortable. And, even
when he regrets conditions, it is al
most impossible to overcome them.
The poor can’t afford servants and
the rich can’t keep them. The best
children require care and attention;
the simplest food must still be pre
pared at considerable labor, as often
per day as several hungry urchins
require; and the smallest, plainest
home won’t keep itself. The wife
can’t quit her job, desert her loved
ones and fail to respond to their
varying needs. The business wo
man suffers grave injustice very
often, but has the better time, after
all. Only a great love makes the do
mestic woman submit to the drud
gery of her existence, year after
year, with no hope of relief until the
children are grown. Take divine,
self-abnegating mother love out of
a woman’s heart, and she’d no more
expend her days in cooking, sewing,
darning, patching, dish-washing,
preserving, making order out of
chaos a dozen times a day, keeping
an eye on mischievous boys and
girls, entertaining casual visitors,
continuing pob’te and urbane to offi
cious “in-laws,” nursing the family
and neighborhood sick, etc., etc.,
than would paterfamilias. The “va
riety” is the most abominable feature
of it, which causes a woman to ex
pend all her energies without seem
ing to accomplish anything in any
direction —and without getting even
the weekly pay-envelope and the
privilege of using its contents as she
pleases.
That any class is driven under the
lash of greed is outrageous, and Mr.
Dolan is earnestly in favor of good
laws, well enforced, against every
form of such oppression. But the
working woman will get her right to
rest, health and sane hours a hun
dred years before the average (not
the petted) wife and mother gets
hers.
