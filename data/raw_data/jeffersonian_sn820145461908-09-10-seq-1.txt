Guarding Our Money
How the Treasury Vaults at Washing
ton are Protected.
Not a dollar has ever been taken
from the United iStates treasury by
force.
Perhaps the nearest approach to
looting the vaults of the treasury was
the time Martin Broadfoot had his
plans about perfected. This was back
in the eighties, and the plan was to
get into the building by means of the
great sewer which runs under and
near the treasury and is known as
the Fifteenth street sewer and which
grows larger as it enters the Potomac
about three-quarters of a. mile from
the White House.
Broadfoot’s plan, as developed aft
er his arrest, was to get into the
building, crack the safes and place
the money in large rubber bags and
float them down the sewer to the
Potomac, where his pals would be in
writing. These bags were found
in his room when he was arrested,
and secret service men had often
seen him walking along the shores of
the Potomac near where the big sew
er empties. This sewer is about nine
feet in diameter where it passes the
treasury. A man could easily make
his way up'the sewer through a
stream of water which under normal
conditions is only about twelve inches
deep. By entering the tunnel or sew
er at the river the journey to the
treasury could be made by keeping a
sharp lookout. When the man or
men in the sewer reached the* Fif
teenth. street sewer nothing would
separate them from the gold coin and
bullion except about eighteen feet of
earth and not too secure stone wall.
It was Broadfoot’s scheme to dig his
way through this obstruction and to
let the earth float or wash down the
sewer. It would not have taken one
man more than two weeks, working
only at night, to have made an open
ening large enough for a man to
crawl through. Os course Broadfoot
knew the exact location of the vaults,
and when he once reached them he
would have had no trouble in getting
the gold coin and bullion. It was evi
dently his purpose to fill the rubber
bags with the precious stuff and float
them down the sewer to the river,
where they would be looked after by
his confederates. This was the only
really well laid plot ever made to
loot the treasury, and just why Broad
foot was never given a trial has nev
er been known to lhe public. He was
an intelligent man, and suspicion was
first aroused against him by his fre
quent visits to the money rooms and
vaults and by the questions he asked

watchmen and messengers as to the
hours of duty, when the time locks
closed and what time they opened,
and all such questions. That he could
have successfully carried out his
plans so far as getting into the build
ing and the vaults are concerned there
is no question, for men have been in
the sewer and conduits who say that
it would have been easy work. The
most difficult part of the job would
have been in getting away with the
money and bullion, for it would have

required hard work to secure it and
get away. About the only chance
would have been to bury it somewhere
in Virginia, for if it had been placed
on boats it would have been easy to
recover it.
It is the opinion of the secret ser
vice men that many celebrated cracks
men have from time to time contem
plated the conversion of a few million
treasury notes to their own use, but
ask .1 study they have decided
that \ ’'undertaking was too colossal
m character. Secretary Folger when
he assumed his duties was not slow
in deciding that the treasury was not
properly guarded. There was not au
electric alarm in the building, the
watchmen were isolated and had no
facilities for calling help, and the
safes were of the old-time lock and
key sort, scattered almost all over the
big building. The secretary went to
work to bring about a. proper condi
tion of affairs. He had the watch
system completely changed and re-or
ganized, putting them under the
strictest discipline. Elaborate and
extensive alarm systems were in
stalled. The oy safes were replaced
by modern steel affairs with time
locks and intricate combinations. The
gold and silver vaults were fitted with
steel casings and time locks, different
parts of the combinations being dis
tributed among various officials, so
that the vaults could be opened only
with the concerted action of all of
them, and then only at the stroke of
the hour for which the time locks
had been set. But without a perfect
system of watchmen to guard the
safes the treasury could be easily
robbed, for the most perfect safe ever
made is not proof against the profes
sionals.
The watch force of the treasury is
perfectly organized, and the least in
fraction of rules means a layoff or
discharge. The men seem to realize
the heavy responsibilities resting up
on them, and they are careful almost
to a fault. The watch is divided into
three reliefs, the tour of duty lasting
for eight hours. However, the watch
does not anticipate an attack by rob
bers, but they are prepared for an/
emergency, and they will not be
caught napping should one ever be
made either at night or by day. Eacn
watchman is a regular walking arse
nal and the instructions are to shoot,
and shoot to kill. —Los Angeles Times.
OPINIONS IN A NUTSHELL.
Mr. Bryan has been presented with

Bryan has been riding for twelve
years is docile enough.—Philadelphia

A strange world, Governor John

cause he had been beaten twice. —New

The call for cash from National

into the Bryan slot machine with no
hopes of getting any returns. —Ran-

We were depending on Mr. Dan
