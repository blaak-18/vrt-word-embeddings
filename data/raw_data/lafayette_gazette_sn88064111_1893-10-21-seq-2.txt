A. Sb R . 'CONSTR UCTING.
t wo weeks since The Gazette ad
v anced some ideas in regard to 1
S hat it considered the best remedy C
'.to apply to reconstruct the present s
-cumbersome. expensive and fari
from satisfactory judiciary system i
..revaiing in this State.
Wde gave it as our opinion that a s
M ; judge and a district attorney should i
be appointed in each and every 1
" parish of the State, and abolish al- I
together the offices of circuit and I
district judges, and also justices of I
the peace. d
The plan suggested by us has this '
merit : public business will be ex- I
pedetiously disposed of, and those (
- charged with offences will thus be (
. afforded a speedy trial, which, it h
S must be confessed, does not at pre- I
sent obtain, save in rare instances. I
Now let us see about the expense c
under thlbtwo ways. At present the I
so circuit judges (outside of New e
Orleans) receive in salary $4o,ooo, p
the 23 district judges receive $69,
ooo, and the az" district attorneys e:
receive $2,o000, making a total of o:
$s1,0oo0 a year that the State is ac- rc
tually paying out. p4
There are 58 parishes in the State,
outside of New Orleans. Let us eo
allow to a judge in each parish, say lo
$1aoo a year, and the district attor- p1
ney $6oo a year, the total would be vi
$10o4,4oo, thereby resulting in the le
saving to the State of $26,600 a L
year. nt
And then it would be possible to
relieve the Supreme Court of the th
State of much work, by creating a tel
Court which would have jurisdic- th'
tion only over criminal matters, me
leaving to. the present Supreme an
Court only civil cases. This court, nu
that we have in view, could be com- be
posed of three members, at a salary an
.' of $5,ooo each a year, and still the me
State would be the gainer, over the TI
present method, of $1i,6oo a year. die
It is evident that some steps must eai
be taken to equalize the work of the
district judges. The 1 7th, as well shi
sL some other districts, have too so<
much business for one man. One to
* i-district in the State is composed of wil
5 parishes; obviously this is more ual
than one man can do justice to. A a v
crying complaint is that civil and Hii
criminal matters are not handled cot
with despatch; that the rights of li- cer
tigants are suffering; that a speedy
trial is out of the question. In this inv
state of affairs what must result? hot
Either half a dozen or more judges que
must be appointed, at an additional enj
expense to the State, or the districts whi
must be reconstructed. The former hac
as we said will entail many thous- on
ands expense to the people; and at
the latter will not bring any relief,
hence the same grounds for com- b
plaint will still exist.
In this matter we have simply fab
outlined a remedial plan on the
present unsatisfactory system, with- pa
out entering into details of jurisdic- p
tion, which is left open for sugges- te
tiors. inte

TJE SHERIFFS.
G. As per announcement the first
ad- Sheriffs' convention of Louisiana
to was organized last Saturday, at the

he Lee McAlvin, Vernon, and six oth- c
ew ers, whose proxies were duly pre- i
o, presented. . t
- Julian Mouton, Esq., by request, .i
ys explained the scope and purposes l;
of of the association, and his further
c- remarks were timely and to the P
point. b
e, A permanent organization was tU
us effected by the election of the fol- n
ty lowing officers: C. T. Cade, Iberia, T
or- president; T. D. Stafford, Rapides, j'
be vice-president; Vic Mauberret, Or- fi
he leans, secretary; I. A. Broussard, 0
a Lafayette, treasurer; J. W. Con
nelly, sergeant-at-arms. c
:o The constitution and by-laws of w
ie the Texas Association slightly al- m
a tered to meet the requirements of o0
this association were adopted. The la
s, membership fee is placed at $zo P
e and the same amount is to be an- to
t, nually paid for dues. Each mem- es
i- ber is to contribute $5 to prosecute to
y any one who may kill or wound a cu
e member in the discharge of his duty. or
e The family of any member who th
dies in office will receive $5 from wi
t each member. te
e Those present paid their member
Il ship fee, and the treasury of the as
D sociation was placed on a firm basis
to start with. The next meeting ju
f will be held in New Orleans on Jan
uary 25, 1894. Before adjournment
L a vote of thanks was tendered Mr. up
1 Hirsch for the manner in which the ex
I court room was placed for the re
ception of the sheriffs. . co
After the meeting the sheriffs and St
invited guests repaired to the Rigues th.
hotel, where a most sumptuous ban- er
quet was partaken of and thoroughly th
enjoyed. It was quite a late hour R
when the party broke up, and they car
had but a short rest, for they left cr
on a special train for the Salt Mines rise
at 5:2 a. m. gro
The reception accorded the party oth
by the Salt Mines officials, and es- t
pecially Mr. S. L. McColla, the af- Ha
fable general manager of the com- eaU
pany, was most cordial, and the taxi
party were given the amplest facili- thm
ties to view the mines. After some of f
interesting hours spent in sightsee
ing the party departed for New putt
Iberia, which point was reached at sn
about to o'clock, and upon invita- acqi
tion of Mr. Cade, the party took sh
breakfast at the Alma house. After drai
breaking their fast the party strolled
about town for some hours, before won
taking the trains for their respective a
homes. whe
The association is now a fixed '
fact, and it is but simple justice to they
Sheriff Ike Broussard to say that to im
him more than to any one olse is i b
the consummation of this organiza- ds
tion due. Being an honorary mem
ber of the Texas association, he had
a chance to view its workings, was th
impressed with the idea that a simi- Capt
lar organization in this State would hat
prove a help to the sheriffs in de- ces
tecting crime and the arrest of the fa
perpetrators. That the organiza- 75 cE
tion will flourish, and meet the full with
expectations of its promoters, isnum
the general wish.or
Mr. Mauberret's Views. parts
A few days ago Mr. Victor Mauberret, i t
civil sheriff for the parish of Orleans, return- drp
ed to the city from the convention of sheriffS the
r 'in- of the state, held at Lafayette. The seesmlon
e was. held for tdie purpose of drawing up
tle somei plan by which the w'orkings of the dif
ferent sherifs' offices In the state might b!
pen systematised and made known to the other
, in sherifs, and to remedy the rude manner of
oenbaducting business in some of the parishes.
nent Mr. Manherret was elected secretary of the
convention, and brought back to the city
Sant the constitution and by-laws adopted at the
were meeting,
the The organization will be a permanent one
ad and the obe object will be to make the work
ing of the office as easy and as perfect as
to possible.
tout The criminal sheriffs have decided to
have published in the leading New Orleans
can dailies the criminal events of the parish, and
a full description of the criminal. In this
heir joining parishes become aware of the crime,
)ass whatever it might be, but every person in
the parish will know of the deed the day
after it has been committed. The object of
the sheriffs is to have made known as soon
it as possible to their brother officers the'exis
tence of a crime, and they have taken the
ana method described to accomplish their pur.
the pose.
een Mr. Mauberret says that the association
ox- of sheriffs is still so young that nothing defin
ty ite has been done excepting the completion
of the organization. -Picayune.

- ANTI'IMONOPOL Y.
ap- In May last Governor Flower af
T. fixed his signature to what is known
A. as the anti-trust laws. A case has
de, just been decided by the New York
my Court of Appeals, which must have
ca- an important bearing cn future ac
ne; tion brought under these laws. Four
Le- persgns were convicted and fined
er, $50o each on an indictment charg
A. ing them with the crime of conspi
ere racy in having formed a compact
eu; entitled "'The Lockport Coal Ex
D. change," an organization which was
ia- charged in the indictment with seek
ry; ing to raise and maintain the price d
th- of coal to consumers, and with this
re- intent to restrict trade, in viola
tion of the act to prevent monopo
st, lies, embraced in the anti-trust e
;es laws.
ter The defence contended" that a
he proof of an overt act was wanting
beyond the mere organization of
as this exchange, and on this ground
,I- made it appeal to the highest court
a, This court, however, affirmed the
:s, judgment of the lower court, thus
Ir- fixing the rigid act in the penal code
d, of the State.
n- Such a law enacted in Louisiana
can do good, for conditions exist
of wherein its adoption and enforce
dI- ment would redound to the benefit A
:f of the masses. There is in Louis- a
e i iana a pact among insurance com
*o panies, which in its main features is
1- to keep insurance rates at the high
- est posible notch, without regard
:e to favorable surrounding cir=
a cumstances. And this is not the
only "trust." It is to, be hoped
o that the constitutional committee
n will give some thought to this mat
te'.
A GRO IVNG E VIL. w
From the report of our last grand pr
jury in regard to the bills of indict
ment returned, as well as those
thrown out, the conclusion is forced T
upon one that much of the criminal
e expenses are caused by some very Li
trivial matters. In this respect the ter
complaint is general throughout the do
State, and we know of no remedy it,
s hat will work a radical cure quick- p
er than the deductions embraced in ant
the following article from the Baton toi
Rouge Truth : ins
A very happy proportion of the cost of !PC
Y carying on parish governments grows out of ing
criminal prosecutions, and these could be adi
materially curtailed by conferring more ju- but
s rjsdiction upon justices of the peace. Ne- its
grocs are in the habit ot invoking the law in star
nearly all their misunderstandings with each oth
Sother, and no matter how trivial the affair, ge
witnesses at the expense of the parish are
- summoned by the score to testify in the case.
- Had justices the power to inflict fines for as- yen
saults or other misdemeanors, as city record- tha
- ers have, it would be a great saving to the 3
jtaxpayer, and would lessen the number of POU
small crimes. Did complainants know that 4
the cost would fall upon themselves in cases turi
Sof failure to prove charges, instead of being vai
borne by the public, they would not be so A
prone to run to the courts, nor would dis- swe
putes and assaults be so frequent if peace
breakers were heavily fined instead of being
sent before the district court to be finally 1
acquitted or lightly punished, after the par
ish had been put to very considerable ex
pense. Instead of the parish treasury being
drained in the prosecution of such cases it
would become a beneficiary from the fines
paid over by justices of the peace, and
would also be relieved from the payment of
justices costs. Criminal expenses are a very
serious matter to the taxpayer and one
where all the relief possible should be
granted by the constitutional committee. If
our schools are no better provided for than G
they are it is for the reason that too much
money is required in criminal prosecutions 187
if our roads are not what they might be, it All
is because hundreds of misdemennors are
sent to the district court which should be
disposed of by justices of the peace.
A Splendid Number.
lMarton Crawford opens up a new line of
thought in his article entitled "'Rome, the
Capital of a New Republic," appearing in
the October Cosmopolitan. It is not likely
that the October number will.have the suc
cess which attended that for September.
The extraordinary spectacle was presented
of a zz -cent miagazine selling for 5o and
75 cents, and many hundreds were even -sold
at $z each. Probably the record remains
without a parallel, in periodical sales, of a
number proving so interesting that, after
atI,ooo copies hLad been sold, the News
Company had orders for 50,oo000 more than
they could supply, while dealers in various
parts of the country, discovering the esteem
in which the magazine was held, immediate
ly raised their prices to double, treble, qua
drupled and in many cases to eight times
the regular price. The -publishers do not
