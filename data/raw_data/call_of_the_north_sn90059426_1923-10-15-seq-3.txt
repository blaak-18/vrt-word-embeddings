ARE ALL KLANSMEN
OUTLAWS?
Governor Walton’s proclamations
would indicate that no one in Okla
homa except the governor has the
courage to fight the Klan. It would
appear that he is a David going out
single handed to slay the hooded
Goliath. The world at large is led to
believe that Governor Walton is now
and always has been the arch enemy
of the Klan and the champion of a
terror stricken and Klan riden peo
ple. The public is also led to believe
that every one who does not heartily
applaud every act of the governor
and endorse his substitution of bayo
net rule in place of civil rule in Okla
homa is either a Klansman or a sub
sidized tool of the Klan.
A brief review of some Klan his
tory in Oklahoma may refresh the
governor’s memory. Shortly after
the Klans were first organized in
Oklahoma the Daily Oklahoman was
the first and only newspaper in the
state to publish the expose of the
Invisible Empire and all of the minute
details of its organization through
out the United States as discovered
and exposed by the New York World.
From the very outset the Oklahoman
took an uncompromising stand
against masked assemblies, a creesi
of religious intolerance and rare ha
tred and the tendency to usurp the
functions of legal government and
place the execution of the law in the
hands of masked and hooded mar
auders.
While the Oklahoman day after
day, both in news and editorial col
umns denounced the Klan, what was
Governor Walton doing?
H. R. FRYE
To. 4115
Governor Walton at that time was
mayor of Oklahoma City and on one
occasion he permitted a parade of
1,500 hooded through the
main streets of Oklahoma City and
he had the police of Oklahoma City,
who were entirely in his charge,
maintain order among the gaping
crowds while the Klan parade was
under way.
Again, while the Oklahoman was
persistently opposing the Klan and'
while Mayor Walton was running for
the office of governor, it is claimed
by the Oklahoma Leader, which was
his organ and supported him in that
race, that he called them up on the
telephone and asked them to hold
back in their opposition to the Klan
as he wanted the votes and support
of the Klansmen. Again, when Jack
Walton was sworn into the highest
office of the state, the Oklahoman
was still consistently criticizing and
opposing the Klan, while Walton, as
governor, appointed dozens of promi
nent Klansmefi to state offices in his
administration. His appointment of
Dr. Davenport as state health com
missioner is only one instance of his
picking out Klansmen for members of
his executive family.
Again, while Walton was governor
and while the Oklahoman was still
opposing the Klan, Governor Walton
made no effort to prevent a well ad
vertised meeting of the hooded
throng of Klansmen at Belle Isle,
north of the city, where the fiery
cross was held on high and scores of
new members were initiated into the
masked order. Was the governor con-
“The pen,” said Richelieu, “is
mightier than the sword.”
In looking back over turbulent Ok
lahoma and the election that marked
the beginning of the end for Gov.
Walton’s despotism, the thing that
stands out brightest of all is the fact
that his overhrow was accomplished
without a shot being fired or a drop
of blood being shed.
A “peaceful revolution” it was, and
at the same time a tribute to the
efficacy of the American form of gov
ernment. It demonstrated that the
ballot, rather than the bullet, offers
the best redress for civil and political
wrongs.
The nation owes a lot to those
sane and clear-headed Oklahomans
who, under threat of bloodshed by
Gov. Walton, replied not in kind, but
grimly buckled on their shooting
’irons and stood guard at the polls
so that the will of the people might
be expressed in orderly fashion. Had
they resorted to violence or had they
adopted Walton’s methods, Oklahoma
would have run red with blood and
a nation that boasts of the freedom
DID YOU KNOW THIS?
The Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
is like the first Christian church
founded in the world, which was a
secret society. We are heirs to the
dear-bought experience of the prim
itive Christians, and many will be
martyrs before the Cause is won.
Let no man falter, for the reward is
great.
The converts of the first Christian
church were clothed in white, and by
solemn ceremonies admitted to the
communion of the faithful. Its rites
were celebrated in secret. It used a
white costume or regalia. It had se
cret signs of recognition. It was a
charitable fraternity, an order of mu
tual support and relief. It aimed to
reform society and rebuild the taber
nacle of humanity upon the divine
idea of charity and mutual love—Jay

sidering membership in the Klan
when he, as mayor, permitted hun
dreds of white robed Klansmen to
parade through the main streets of
Oklahoma City? Was he thinking
of the votes of Klansmen when he
appointed numbers of Klansmen to
offices which he, as governor, had the
appointive power to fill.
If he knew that the invisible gov
ernment had supplanted the visible
government in Oklahoma, why did he,
as governor, permit the public
domonstration of the Klan and the
initiation of scores of Klansmen to
take place in view of thousands! of
people and within two miles of our
domeless capitol?
Wherein is the governor consistent
when in view of these facts he pro
claims himself the arch enemy of the
Klan and denounces the Oklahoman
as being controlled and run by the
Klan although it was the first and
has always been the most consistent
opponent of the Klan in the state.
The Oklahoman joins the governor
in denouncing the mob whippings,
masked raiders, secret orders foster
ing religious and racial intolerance,
but it will not join with the governor
in urging citizens to shoot masked
Klansmen who have broken no exist
ing law and it deplores what it be
lieves to be his unlawful acts when
he trains machine guns on the place
where a legally called grand jury
has been summoned to meet and when
he seeks to incarcerate without a fair
trial members of the Klan and re
fuses to permit them the right which
every American citizen has, to be
brought before a court on a writ of
habeas corpus to allow a court to
determine whether or not the im
prisonment is lawful or otherwise.-'
Governor Walton has forgotten
that Klansmen are citizens and as
such are entitled to liberty, free
speech, the right of assembly, the
right of fair trial by jury, the right
to the writ of habeas corpus when
unlawfully imprisoned, and the right
of every consideration and protection
which is guaranteed to every Ameri
can citizen, under both our state and
national constitutions.
Governor Walton would have it ap
pear that only Catholics, Jews and
anti-Klansmen are now citizens and
that a Klansman is ipso facto an
outlaw. More than once the gov
ernor has said that he will pardon
any man who kills a hooded Klans
man and he does not even stipulate
that the Klansman must have prev
iously broken some law.
The Oklahoman does not believe in
some of the tenets of the Klan, nor
does it believe in its methods, but it
knows and Governor Walton knows
that thousands of good, law abiding
citizens in this state are members of
the Klan and they have just as much
right to run for office and to hold
office as' anti-Klansmen. If they
transgress any law they are entitled
to the same fair trial as would be
accorded any other citizen.
In denying constitutional and legal
rights to Klansmen, Governor Wal
ton has himself broken the laws and
violated the constitution which, in
his oath of office swore to uphold.
of its people to seek redress at the
voting booths would have been bowed
in shame.
The outcome was a defeat for Gov.
Walton, rather than a victory for
the Ku Klux Klan, for the battle cry
of the “revolution” was “We Want
Neither Klan nor King.” Fighting
the common foe, Klansmen and anti-
Klansmen alike strapped on their
guns and stood side by side at the
polls to see that the voters got a
square deal. Hurriedly organized,
the “ballot box revolution” gave Ok
lohamons opportunity to express
their attitude on a foolish and unnec
essary dictatorship.
1 As for Gov. Walton, little need be
said. Like every other dictator in
history, he chose a worthy movement
to deceive the people. His fight on
the Klan was the vehicle for further
ing his selfish purposes. The virtue
which lay in the movement at the
start became vice when misapplied.
The nation is proud that Oklahoma
chose the sane way to correct a
wrong.—St. Paul Daily News.

THE CALL OF THE NORTH
THE KLAN IS NO HAVEN
FOR HATE-VENDORS
One by one, as the battlements of
prejudice are tom down by the un
defeated armies of truth, enemies of
the Ku Klux Klan retreat to new
points of expected vantage from
whence they hope to pour a barrage
of condemnation that will rout the
oncoming white-clad hosts l«d by
the flaming cross of Christianity and
flying the banner of loyalty to Ameri
can ideals.
Claims that the Klan is a self- dis
penser of law have been sent to the
discard by thinking people who realize
that the accusations have never been
substantiated.
The howl against the mask and
secret membership has failed with the
awakening knowledge that this must
be since all else has failed.
Charges that the Klan has no right
to exist because of its selective mem
bership have been discredited by
pointing to the Catholic and Jewish
orders and the societies of foreigners
that exist in this land, allowing none
but natives of their land or subscrib
ers of their faith to become mem
bers.
But the cry of “intolerance” con
tinues. The voices are weakening
but now and again the plaintive wail
of the opposition is heard to sound
the claim that the Klan is an anti-
anti-engro, anti-Jewish or
der. It remains but an echo of the
nationwide cry of “wolf” that went
up at the Klan’s inception.
Shortly this stronghold of opposi
tion will die at the hands of public
opinion. Men who joined the order
expecting to have within its meeting
places a spot where they could give
vent to the bigoted hatred for those
who held not their beliefs, are being
weeded out by banishment or are
leaving of their own accord when they
find that meetings of Klansmen are
not for the purpose of planning a
night of lawlessness, plotting revenge
against personal enemies or given
over to expressions of hate again c t
those who are denied admission to
the meetings because of their reli
gious belief or nativity.
Men so spineless that they would
say behind locked doors what they
fear to express in public, thinking
that in a Klan meeting they are amid
brother haters, are finding that their
$lO has not bought them a special
privilege to vent their spleen in
safety.
The Klan has but one aim—the
best interests of America.
The Klan is “going down the white
alley” minding its own business. If
there are enemies who persist in
sticking their noses into the right-of
way they are bound to be bumped.
The Klan is not going out of its
way to fight those who oppose it:
but if these people persist in un
patriotic motives, insist on fostering
things that are not in accord with
the ideals of American liberty and
governmental form it is only reason
able to expect that the Klan will op
pose them. Those people have gotten
in the way, have meddled with the
machinery of democratic government.
A true Klansman respects the de
votion of a Catholic to his faith. Hd
has no quarrel with the Catholic peo
ple or their religion. He admires the
force they display in fighting for
the things they think are right. But
he does differ with the seat of Roman
Catholicism. The Pope, in his plans
for unity of church and state and his

sits on a foreign throne, is meeting
the opposition of the Klan, a united
opposition
Klansmen have not forgotten that
the negro is not in this land by his
intent. He was brought here by the
white man and it is the duty of the
white man through the generations to
look to his best interests. It is a
duty handed down to him by his an
cestors. But the Klan does not be
lieve that the negro should be held
in the light of a martyr or that he
should be exalted. This is a white
man’s land and the white man SHALL
govern. But in his government he
shall make provision to care for th*
negro the same as any citizen. #
True Klansmen respect the Jew for
his love for race and his clinging to
fellow men. There is compassion for
the Jew who has felt heaviest of all
races the wrath of the Supreme Be
ing. The greatest hatred for the Jew
is created by jealousy. His money
making proclivities have caused the
greatest opposition. Lack of belief in
the divinity of Christ is the only bar
between him and membership in the
Klan that is not universal.
Some say the Klan lives in the face
of opposition because of the national
reaction to foreign immigration.
Others say that it is because of pro
hibition.
The Klan admits the indictment.
These and other as urgent needs
are the basis of the great growth of
the order. Does anyone deny the
Klan the right to exist on such a
platform? Have we not all felt the
pressure of cheap labor from abroad,
lowering property values because of
undesirable neighbors who live the
life of another land that is not up to
the standards of civilization that hold
in America, seen probihition violated
openly by persons who do not have
proper respect for the laws on the
statute books, and witnessed the low
ering moral standard and pressure of
foreign principles in this land?
Indeed we have; and we are awake.
The Klan is not built by high-pres
sure commission men. The Klan is
builded by its members. The few
hundred organizers of the Klan in
this country could never have rolled
up a membership of 5,000,000 native
born, white, Protestant gentile mer.
in' the space of three years unless
every member had been bringing in
his quota of new applicants. Mem
bers seek members in the brotherhood
because they realize its value and
want their worthy and eligible friends
to join with them in this great duty.
Not a day passes that some unor
ganized section of lowa does not send
a call to Klan headquarters for an
organizer to start a branch of the
organization in its bommunity. This
demand is created by need and not by
adjectives coupled together in high
sounding phrases and coming from
the mouth of an organizer. It i 3
true over the land.
The Klan will play a part in poli
tics. It has the right as has the De
mocrats or Republicans, the Socialists
or Progressives. But the Klan is free
to choose its candidates from any
political belief and is not bound by
party loyalty to support candidates
whom they know in their own hearts
are not worthy.
The Klan grows in the face of tre
mendous opposition because it is a
house builded upon a rock.
Hate is the sand foundation; truth
the rock upholding everlasting en
deaver for the cause that is right.

A SECRETARY
What benefits will accure from a
Department of Education with a Se
cretary in the President’s Cabinet?
In the first place, it does not mean
that the Federal Government pro
poses to assume the control and ad
ministration of education. Such an
attempt would be clearly unconstitu
tional, nor would it be for the best
interests of our public schools. The
schools must be kept in close touch
with the people whom they serve and
be subject to their immediate super
vision and control. The Federal Gov
ernment can set up standards and
show why such standards should be
accepted, but the authority of final
decision in all educational matters
must remain in the states where it
is placed by the Tenth Amendment
to the Constitution.
Education Deserves a Full Recognition
The establishment of a Department
of Education with a Secretary in the
President’s Cabinet will give to edu
cation the recognition which it justly
deserves because of its vital impor
tance from the standpoint of national
welfare. Thru such a department the
Federal Government could promote
education, as it has promoted other
great interests over which it does
not have control. Examples of pro
motion without control are found in
the Department of Agriculture and
the Department of Labor.
When our Government was estab
lished it was decided, after very care
ful deliberation, to place the adminis
tration of the different departments
then created under officials appointed
by the President and confirmed by
the Senate. At first there were but
three such departments, the Depart
ment of State, the Department of the
Treasury, and the Department of
War. The heads of these depart
ments together with the Attorney
General, appointed by Washington,
were his immediate advisors and
came to be known as the President’s
Cabinet.
Realized Need Brought More De-
partments
In 1798 Congress establisht the De
partment of the Navy, and a, fifth
Cabinet office was created. In 1829
the Postmaster General was elevated
in rank and ryade a member of
President Jackson’s Cabinet. In 1849
the Department of the Interior was
created to take charge of Indian af
fairs, which had been under the con
trol of the War Department and of
the public Lands, which had been
under the Treasury Department. To
this new department were assigned
also the Pension Office from the War
Department, the Patent Office from
the State Department, and several
other bureaus.
These seven Cabinet members were
each in charge of a department which
administered affairs over which the
Federal Government had absolute
control under the provisions of the
Constitution. It was thought then
that there would be no further ad
ditions to the President’s Cabinet. In
1862 the Bureau of Agriculture was
created, and a few years later the
Bureau of Education. It soon be
came apparent that agriculture could
not obtain the recognition which its
importance in relation to national
welfare justified without being rep
resented in the President’s Cabinet,
and thereby being enabled to obtain
directly the attention of Congress.
Accordingly, the agricultural inter
ests of the country started a move
ment for the establishment of a De
partment of Agriculture, with a Se
cretary in the President’s Cabinet at
its head.
Opponents Argued Then as Now
The opponents of this movement
argued that in as much as the Fed
eral Government had not been grant
ed authority by the Constitution to
control agriculture it was illogical, if
not unconstitutional, to create such
a department. Those who favored
the creation of such a department
conceded that the Federal Govern
ment could not control agriculture,
and frankly stated that they did not
wish such control. But they claimed
that it was within the province of
the National Government to promote
agriculture and that because of the
importance of the subject from a na
tional standpoint agriculture should
receive such recognition and promo
tion. The Department of Agriculture
was created in 1889, the Federal Gov
ernment thereby establishing the
principle of national recognition and
promotion without national control.
Why Does Education Remain in a
Subordinate Bureau?
While the controversy over the es
tablishment of a Department of
Agriculture was going on, the edu
cators of the country urged the estab
lishment of a Department of Educa
tion, insisting that education was of
no less importance to national wel
fare than agriculture. Altho their
claims were not succesfully refuted,
their petition was not granted, and
education has remained unto this day
in a subordinate bureau of the De
partment of the Interior. This is
probably due in part to the fact that
educators have not been as persistent
and effective in urging the promotion
of education as have the sponsors of
OF EDUCATION
By HUGH S. MAGILL,
other interests, and also to the fact
that certain private interests have al
ways opposed the development of
public education.
A few years later the representa
tives of commerce and of labor set
up their claims for Federal recogni
tion, and as a result of their persis
tent efforts the Department of Com
merce and Labor was establisht in
1903 for the recognition and promo
tion of these two important interests.
In 1913 this Department was sepa
rated into the Department of Com
merce and the Department of Labor,
each with a Secretary in the Presi
dent’s Cabinet.
In the light of this history it is
necessary only to show that educa
tion is vitally related to national wel
fare in order to justify its recogni
tion and promotion by the establish
ment of a Department of Education
with a Secretary in the President’s
Cabinet. This is so evident that it
would seem hardly necessary to offer
arguments in its support. When it
was found that of the 2,400,000
drafted men between the ages of 21
and 31 more than 700,000 could not
read and write, the Federal Govern
ment came face to face with educa
tion as a question of the greatest na
tional importance.
Importance of Education Has Again
When another 700,000 of these
young men had to be rejected from
military service because of physical
defects, most of which could have
been prevented by proper attention
and instruction in youth, the impor
tance of education from the national
standpoint was again emphasized.
No one will contend that our country
as a whole is not deeply interested
in the Americanization of our for
eign population, all of whom have
been admitted to our shores under
national laws.
But there is still deeper signi
ficance to public education from the
standpoint of national welfare. It
was recognized by our forefathers at
the very beginning of our govern
ment. The Ordinance of 1787 de
clares that ‘Religion, morality and
knowledge being necessary to free
government and the happiness of
mankind, schools and the means of
education shall forever be encourag
ed.” It must be conceded by all that
the security and perpetuity of a gov
ernment of the people is dependent
upon an enlightened citizenship. If
we are to develop a civilization which
shall stand the severe tests of the
coming years, the right kind of edu
cation must be promoted thruout the
entire nation. To give the greatest
impetus to a movement for universal
education of the right sort, there
must be the stimulating influence of
a national purpose.
A question of such transcending
importance, so vitally related to the
security and prosperity of our coun
try, cannot be disregarded by the na
tional government and left entirely
to the states arid local communities.
National ideals cannot be realized by
states and communities unaided by
national encouragement and support.
There must be the unifying influence
of a national incentive that educa
tion may accomplish the greatest
good and make the largest contribu
tion to national welfare.
Department of Education Will Not be
The Natibnal Government thru its
Department of Education will exer
cise no autocratic power in the real
ization of this end. It will stimulate
and encourage but it can never dic
tate. It will make a thoro investiga
tion of all educational questions, and
a comparative study of the education
al systems of all the states. It will
then suggest certain educational
standards, based upon this broader
knowledge, which should be attained
in all the states in order to preserve
our free institutions and make pos
sible the realization of our highest
national ideals. The Secretary of
Education, because of his high offi
cial position, will always have a
hearing. What his department pro
poses will receive the consideration
of the President, of Congress, and of
the people of the country.
Thru natio na 1 promotion and
stimulation standards will be raised
in all states. The day will be has
tened when it can no longer be said
that millions of American citizens
cannot read the Constitution, nor even
their ballots, a condition which
humbles our national pride and is
fraught with the gravest danger.
The perpetuity and prosperity of
our nation demand that it give all
possible encouragement and assis
tance to the states in the develop
ment thru education of a citizenship
physically and intellectually sound,
and imbued with the spirit and ideals
of true Americanism. Thus only can
our Republic be made safe, efficient
and enduring.
