Children's Day.
Last Sunday was "Children's
Day" at the Methodist church. The
church was taxed far beyond its seat
ing capacity and many were !com
pelled.to stand during the services.
Over one hundred children, all
members of the Sunday School,
took part in the exercises and the
manner in which they acquitted
themselves reflects much credit up
on the worthy superintendent, Mr.
David Riggs, and those who -volun
teered their assistance. Each di
vision of the school was presented
with a silken banner by the ~ev. T.
SvRandle. Mr. Riggs reatd an in

- ,Ã½ it is settled that
it war aItrtated, a handsome
amount having already been sub
scribed by the cit;zens for that pur
pose. The committee on sub
scribtions made a house to house
canvass of the town and the results
of their efforts to raise the necessary
funds have been very satisfactory.
The committees have not yet
made known the nature of all the
attractions but it is safe to say that
they will be both novel and inter
esting. The baby show will doubt
less prove, a prominent feature of
the celebration. It can not fail to
draw the ladies. It is new here and
it will be -really funny, We have
the material in abundance and it
will only be necessary to induce the
good mothers to bring their "'dim
pled darlings" to the show. If only
one-fifth of our. baby population
turn out it will.be a howling success.
Of course after the decision there
will be much gnashing of teeth
and savage threats will be uttered
against the lives of the judges, but
these are the inevitable conse
quences of a baby show; without
them the baby show would be in
complete. There will be innumer
able other things to amuse the pub
lic. Bicycle, trotting, mule and horse
races, a tournament, a ball, a base
ball game, etc. The following are

A Remarkable Cure of Rheu

Westminster, Cal., March a ,
x894.-Some time ago, on awaken
ing one morning, I found that I
had rheumatism in my knee so bad
ly that, as I remarked to my wife,
it would be impossible for me to
attend to bussiness that day. Re
membering that I had some of
Chamberlain's Pain Balm in my
store I sent for a bottle, and rubbed
the afficted parts thoroughly with it,
according to directions, and within
an hour I was completely relieved.
One application had done the busi
ness. It is the best liniment on the

- First Communuion.
One hundrgd and eighty children
received the sacrament of commu
nion at the Catholic church last
Thursday morning. As usual this
most beautiful ceremony had at
tracted a large crowd of people
from differett parts of the parish.
Among the priests who participated
in the ceremonies were Fathers
Maltrait, of this place, B. Branch
of Rayne, and A. B. Langlois of
St. Martinville. The children
were in charge of the good
sisters of the Mount .Carmel,
convent, to whom is due much cred
it fot the splendid d scipline of the
little ones which was a noticeable
feature of the celebration. Just
before the sacrament wrs admibis
tered o the children the c.noir.sang
-"Lauda 6ion'" which was followed
by "L'Aige et L'Ame" a duo, ren
dered with much success by Mrs.

I feel it my duty to let the public know
that owing to my absence in Houston, on
the 21st of IMay, I tranferred to a brother
veteran, Oneil Barron, the pleasant duty
of presenting a bouqcuet to Miss \Vinnie
Davis. We were honored by her presence
and the presentation of flowers to her wast
but a fitting compliment due the daughter
of our dead chief.
