Or when the air was full of rushlng winds

Now give! Give love. perhaps. But, "No,'
Life said;
" 'Though Love must be
And Love is fair--y, wondrous fair is Love
'Tis not for thee."

A SUBURBAN EXPERIENCE
BY MRS. M . R. RAYVNf.
"It isn't because I am tired of our flat
that I want to live in the suburbs, but
the doctor says we both need change,"
concluded Mrs. Perry Thorne, who was
making her first plea for country life.
"I agree with the doctor that we
need change of one sort at least," an
swered her husband.
"Don't be flippant, dear. I am in
dead earnest; and oh, Perry, I know of
such a dear cottage, one of a row."
"I dislike rows," said Perry. "hlow
ever, if you are determined to be a
suburbanite, and with the suburbian
ites staid, I may as well agree to go. I
will at once take lessons on the flying
trapeze so that I may sometimes be
able to catch a train. I shall study to
acquire that dazed suburban stare that
people who eat their breakfast:; and
dinners by lamplight assafme, assisted
by catching their quota of sleep in
depots after they have missed the
train."
"Oh, we won't be there long enough
for that," said his wife; "and, Perry,
the air is just heavenly-so sustaining."
"That's good, as we shall probably
be twelve miles or more from a grocery
store. Have you caught your house
yet, Maud?"
"Oh, yes. Mrs. Smead has one in the
same row, and she told me about ours.
It is the southwest' corner house,
while hers is the southeast. Isn't it
strange, Perry, that 1 have never been
introduced to Mr. Smead? I wduldn't
believe there was any such person if I
had not seen him."
"Nothing strange about it," growled
Perry, in what his-wife called his "bull
dog" voice. "I suppose you want to
know him because he has the reputa
tion of being a lady killer."
"Perry!"
"I am told by fellows we both know
that he prides himself on his beauty."
"I hate beauty-men," said Maud,
soothingly, "they are all vain, conceit
ed creatures. I never would marry a
handsome man."
Perry mumbled something and went
away, first giving his wife permission
to do as she pleased about taking the
suburban house.
A week later both families were set
tied in the row which fronted a street
and a railroad track, and was equi-dis
tant from two depots.
Mr. Smead did not take as kindly to
the change as Perry Thorne did, but
he told his wife, thoughtlessly, that
on. good feature of suburban life was
having the Thornes for neighbors.
"Where have you ever met Mrs.
Thorne?" asked his wife, suspiciously.
"Don't know her from Adam, my
dear, but isn't she your friend, and
haven't I heard her praises sung ever
since we were married?"
"H'm! We have a calling acquaint
ance, and now we are to be neighbors.
I suppose you will meet. But you are
so susceptible, and she is so giddy, I
just know you will set people talking."
"Great Caesar, Laura, you give your
best friend a great send off! I suscep
tible and she giddy? We must be made
for each other!"
Mrs. Smead looked volumes at her
husband, but where is the man who
does not enjoy being a bone of conten
tion among his women-folk, and if
Smead had a special and particular
virtue, it was that of being good na
tured.
Mrs. Smead, like the woman of his
tory, had two treasures-her sewing
machine and her husband, and she
drew the line at lending either, and if
people wanted to call her selfish they
might. Fortfiedby this iaw she rented
thi houthwest cottage.
Saturday night! The invisible bridge
spans the distance between the world
of labor and the world of rest. The
tranquil air gave back no murmur of
the multitudinous voices that had filled
it with cries of sorrow, anger, or glad
ness during the work days of the past
week. It was the ante-chamber of the
Sabbath, a time so sacred to our an
cestors that all work and all pleasure
was suspended, that the soul itself
might rest.
SA great throng of people was hurry
ing homeward, and all bore the happy
burdens of 3Saturday night-new shoes
for the little burden-bearers, I new
bonnet for mother, tihe Sunday dinner
-and among them Perry Thorns and
Amos Smead, who bhd struck up a

laden to the ears with brown pldiar
packages snd had just time to snake
the train, after purclfasing their com

through the gates in approved sa
burban style, and easught on just as the
train moved out, and .theta Pettr
shouted in a voice that srtinded above
the roar of escaping steam:
"We've left our Sunday dinners oa

lie swung himself elearoft the train,
turned a somersault, and waved "all
right" to Smead, who mopped the cin
ders and perspiration fonom his face ~tid
remarked to the man standing next to
him, in a friendly way:
"Nice way to spend the summer, liv
ing in the suburbs?"'
"Yes, if you don't care whvt-you say;"
growled the man.
Then Smead took a bit of pasteboard
from his pocket and began to study it.
"Southeast corner, Terrace row, Oak
land."
Smead asked his gruff neighbor if he
got off at that station.
"No, I don't," sait, the man. "You
couldn't hire me to live in that swamp.
I go out ten miles further, where you
don't have to sift the atmosphere to
keep the mosquitoes from choking
you."
That sounded discouraging, but
Smead was not anxious to ride ten
miles further on an accommodation
train, that slowed up for every cow on
the track, and he wrapped himself in
a speculative reverie until the brake
man called "O-a-k-l-a-n-d!" as if only
the deaf lived at that station.
DMrs. Sinead was waiting foriher hus
band, whom she expected on the half
past six train, but the train had come
and gone, and instead of the handsome,
well-groomed Mr. Smead, a frantic
woman, her neighbor, Mrs. Thorne,
rushed into her cottage.
"I've caught him!" she gasped. "lie's
locked up in the library! Oh! oh! oh!"
"Caught whom?'' asked the mystified
woman. Then seeing that her dis
tracted visitor was very near fainting,
she collected restoratives and brought
back 'Mrs. Thorne's scattered wits.
Maud explained as soon as she could
speak that a desperate looking man, a
burglar, she was certain, and a con
vict as well, by the cut of his hair
had feloniously entered her house a
moment before she came, alrl walk
ing boldly Into her library had beer
locked safely therein by herself.
"The windows are nailed down; i
have been waiting for Perry to oper
them, so he cannot escape that way,'
she concluded.
"I expect Amos on the last train. I
don't see what is keeping him," said
Mrs. Smead, "but he has not come
yet."
"Neither has Perry, but perhaps the3
will come together. Isn't it dreadful?
I daren't go back with that man in the
house. I know by his looks he's a mur.
derer. Our girl hasn't come, and I'm
all alone. Oh, if Mr. Smead were only
here?"
"I guess I'll do ju-.t as well," said
Mrs. Smead, coldly. "I will take our
revolver, and you can bring the stove
lifter, and we will interview him
through the door."
"But what good will that do? lHe
may s-h-o-o-t first!"
"Come on," said Mrs. Smead, con
temptuously. She was only a young
matron Iherself, but she was not going
to be ignominiously routed by a one
man army, and she led the way to her
neighbor's cottage. No other people
lived in the row, so they had all the
fun to themselves.
But at that identical moment the
seven-forty train, sometimes called the
"husbands' train," so many of them
went out to spend the week's interval
with their families, stopped at the
nearest depot, and Perry Thorne, with
his double load of packages, hove in
sight. -loth women were overjoyed to
see him.
"What's the row?" he asked, drop
piag his bundles on the veranda.
"A man!" said both women at once.
"Where is Smead?"
"That is what I would like to know."
said Mrs. Smead; "I expected him on
this train."
"I haven't seen him. Who is the
man?"
"A burglar, and he's locked up in the
library. Don't you think I was brave?"
asked Maud, who, now that her hus
band had come, felt that she might
pose as a heroine.
"Burglars already? Ha! this is a
diversion. Give me the key, Maud.
I'll take your revolver. Mrs. Smead.
Now, ladies, stand aside," and Perry
made a valiant rush for the library
door, which he unlocked and threw
open, at the same presenting arms ac
cording to the best manual practice.
"Don't shoot!" cried a familiar voice
that trembled, not with fear, but mer
riment, as Mr. Smead stepped smiling
ly forward, and bowed low to Maud:
"I am Mrs. Thorne's captive," he said.
"What does this mean?" demanded
Mrs. Smead in the measured syllablcs
of the divorce court.
"It means," explained Mr. Smead,
"that my wife has not yet learned to
box the compass. She gave me 'south
west' and your wife locked me up in a
room that has no ventilation, and un
der a criminal ban. iBut I forgive
her," he added, with gallant protest.
whereat Maud's cheeks grew red with
embarrassment. and Mrs. Sm'ead said:
"Come home! After this I will meet
you at the train and see that you don't
get into the wrong house,"
"Do forgive me, Mr. Smead," said
Maud, penlitently, while Perry glared
darkly like a jealous stage lover, "but
you did look so-so-"
"She said you looked like a convict,"
remarked his wife.
"At least it has made us acquainted,"
observed Mr. Smead. true to his colors,
and with this parting shot he followed
his wife to the "southeast" cottage.

They refuse to compare the recent
figures with those of the corresponding
period in the fiseal year 1893, but per
sist in telling their readers that the
country is going to Crin beenatse we
are importing more goods taw thaf
werg imported in the depths of the
panic.
It is true that the imports during
the +iouitlis ivlielh save gtAlapsed since
the enactment of tihe i1dW trifiL. hars
been larger than the imports durrifn
the corresponding months of last year.
It is encouraging thrt this increase has
talten place. Our republican friends
should bear in mind the fact that at
the same time the country has been
experiencing a remarkable rtvival of
business activity and confidence. ila1
the increase of imports paralyzed do
mestiC indutstry? Let the great
and fgrowin demand for consumption,
the extraordinary list of increase of
wages, the resumption of work
in hundreds of idle factories, the ad
vance of prices, and the mrany other
proofs of returning prosperi:y, answer
this question. It was inevitable that
recovery from panic depression should
be accompanied by an increase of im
ports, and this increase would have
taken place even under rates like those
of the MlcKinley act. Republicans
know, or ought to know, that the im
ports of dutiable goods were consider
ably larger inthe fiscal year 1893,when
the McKinley duties were in force,
than they have been in the fiscal year
just ended, although raw sugar was
free from duty then and has been duti
able since August 28 last. The follow
ing table shows the value of the im
ports during the eleven months ending
on DMay 31 for the last three years, the
last three figures of each number hav
ing been omitted:

Total ........ 8673,353 8563.:13 $793.736
It will be observed that the imports
for the eleven months in the last fiscal
year were less by 155 per cent. than
those of the eleven months of 1893, un
der the McKinley duties, although the
free imports in 1893 were swollen by
8105,000,000 worth of raw sugar, while
the dutiable imports of 1895 included
about 40,003000 for raw sugar trans
ferred to the dutiable list. It is en
couraging, and it s a sign of return
ing confidence and prosperity, that the
imports of 1895 are larger than those
of 1814. The McKinley rates did not
prevent the purchase of foreign goods
by the people of this country, who
shipped to foreign lands last year
$550,000,000 worth of the products of
agriculture, with other exports
amounting to about $250,000,000. Dur
ing the panic, however, their foreign
pifrchases were-abnormally small; now
they are increasing again.
IBut the increase has not brought the
totals up to the level of 1893. and to
this fact-so carefully avoided or ig
nored by them-we direct the atten
tion of republicans and republican
journals. the following table will en
able them to compare the imports un
der the leading schedules during the
eleven months ending on May 31 of
this year with those of the correspond
ing months in the fiscal years 1894 and
1893. They always stop with 1894. be
cause the figures for 1893 (a year dur
ing which the McKinley tariff was in
full force) make their partisan pleas
and arguments ridiculous. For con
venience in tabulation we have cut
off the last three figures of each num

During nine of the eleven months of
the fiscal year 1895 the new tariff was
in force; during the entire period of
eleven months in the fiscal year 1893
the tariff law in operation was that of
McKinley. As in the case of the totals
in our first table, so with respect to
every one of these items, the value of
the imports has been less in 1895 than
it was in 1_893. We have repeatedly
urged our republican contemporaries
to admit the existence of this differ
ence, and to comment upon it, but we
have urged in vain.-N. Y. Times
The Lesson of Free Weool.
The coming congress, we venture to
predict, will not put a tax on imposts of
wool. It is mighty hard to reenslave
an article once set free. MlcKinley
tried to do it with hides and failed.
Free wool adds another to the object
lessons taught by quinine and hides.
Had a republican congressman put all
sugars on the free list, instead of tax
ing refined in order to shelter ind
maintain the sugar trust, the last con
gress would not have been able to tax
imports even for revenue. The farm
ersa who yet imagine they were hurt by
free wool might as well give up and
join the rest of us now in an effort to
get free woolens. Fifty per cent. pro
tection on them is absurd as well as
outrageous.--St. Paul Globe

No strife is so bitter and relentless

or by national jealousies. Nineteen

alien birth, who, unmindful of the hos
bitality shown them by these shores,
hat've at'ried their old country s'ds

own deadly hatred. The orange and

curences of laygoae n.es. Such sar
agery as extended itself among various
aliens has been promnoted by native
Americann in their own fanatic patriot
min, their own demand that whoever
has come from beyond the sear: shall
conform in the wavinsg of flags, in ihe
observance of a New England Sabbath,
in regulating their personal habits to a
fanatical American standard. This
sltitation has been deepened and inten
sified by the utter dishonesty of the re
publican party itn maintaicing high
protective tariff laws exclusively for
the benefit of the manufacturer.
That policy has maintained free
trade in labor while making a closed
market for American products. It has
resulted in driving distinctively Amer
ican labor from all the paths of indus

atically with aliens who h.ve been
coaxed hither by the promise of high
wages to ba given them by protects.
manufacturers. who wish to have the
benefit of free trade in labor. All the
while Americans were told by preach
ers of tariff legislation that the one
purpose was to dignify, enrich and en
noble the American laborer, and all
the while the real beneficiaries were
bringing the cheapest labor of the
world into this market-labor with all
its, racial prejudices, all its savage
promptings and all its willingness to
underbid native labor.
The Hun and the Slav have taken the
place of the American laborers at
mines. Tumult and disorder have
arisen in various places as the result
of lockouts and of strikes and of en
counters between contending savages.
The real responsibility for such exhj
bition of barbarism in America lies at
the door of the republican protective
policy, that has steadily sought to dis
courage or forbid imnportations of fab
rics, but has opened wide the ports of
America to the least. enlightened peo
ples of the earth and has brought them
here for no other purpose than to drive
out intelligent American labor as be
ing too high-priced for the greedy cor
porations that would have a tariff law
benefit them in both ways by giving
them cheap labor and a mono h)ly
market.
