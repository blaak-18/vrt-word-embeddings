“Vigilantes” a la Kerfoot
MONUMENTAL FARCE RIVALS THAT OF
FAKE TELEGRAM “FROM PRESIDENT”
Minnesota Methodists Do Not Stand With The
Hamline “U" Prexy in AntUKlan Activities.
(BY WINGFOOT) '
That Frank C. Sidoney, secretary
of the National Vigilance Association,
will have much more “explaining to
do in regard to the indiscriminate
use of names of business men and
college presidents whom that organi
zation gave out as members, is seen
in the investigation being conducted
by The Fiery Cross. All indications
now r point to the whole matter being
a monumental farce perpetrated on
the people and a gigantic hoax foisted
upon the newspapers which carried
the story and the “list of names al
ready in the association."
On last Saturday, Secretary Sid
oney “admitted an error” in the use
of the name of Dr. Robert Aley, presi
dent of Butler College. Just now the
error occurred is a matter of con
jecture for the reason that Dr. Aley
has protested the use of his name
before it was given out. A state
ment by Dr. Aley, following the un
authorized use of his name, brings
to light the fact that he had written
the Vigilance Association two differ
ent times declaring that he was not
in sympathy with the movement and
would not allow his name to be used.
Directory Evidently Used
Due to the fact that denials of any
connection with the Vigilance Asso
ciation are coming from every part
of the country, it would appear that
names were taken at random from a
directory, especially in view of the
fact, that Aven Nelson, given as pres
ident of Wyoming University, retired
from that position more than one
year ago. Also, he denies, in a tele
gram to The Fiery Cross of having
“committed the university to any
such program" as that laid out by
the Vigilance Associatiun, which is
formed, according to the newspaper
dispatch, to “wage an intensive coun
try-wide campaign looking to the
disintegration of the Ku Klux Klan
and kindred organizations."
The story, which came out of
Washington, D. C., and which was
printed in the daily press in all parts
of the country, is fast taking on the
appearance of being a part of that
systemized effort now being made
to convince the public that certain
leaders in the business world and the
leading educators of the United
States are opposed to the Klan. It
fits in nicely with that part of the or
ganized opposition’s attempt to make
it appear that the Klan is “dwin
dling."
The following telegram in reply to
a query by the Fiery Cross*, is illu
minative of the tactics employed by
the amalgamated enemies of this
country, and is from Stephen B* L.
Penrose, president of Whitman Col
lege, of Walla Walla, Wadi.
“Just returned home. I was not
an original incorporator of the Na
tional Vigilance Association and
know nothing of its real purposes.
I was notified on October thirty-first
by a letter from a man in Washington
personally unknown to me that I
had been appointed a member of the
National Committee of the National
Vigilance Association, an organiza
tion which I had never heard of be
fore. It was described as having for
its objects the promotion of patriot
ism and regard for law and without
suspicion, I accepted the appoint
ment but stipulated that I assume no
duties or obligations. .Since that
time the newspapers have ascribed
an anti-Klan motive to Vigilance As
sociation. I have written to Wash
ington for authentic information. If
the organization is anti-Klan I will
. withdraw from it."
Radio Head Makes Denial
David Saroff, head of the Radio
Corporation of America, New York
and whose name appeared in the list
as a member, has declared that he
does * not belong. This information
wds contained in a telegram to The
Fiery Cross. Samuel P. Leeds, pres
ident of the Chamber of Commerce,
Atlantic City, declares that his name
was used without authorization.
A telegram from A. S. Newlands,
secretary for Mr. Leeds, reads:
“Samuel P. Leeds has been in hos
pital for three weeks. He is not a
♦ \
* ■ ■ • - se

member of National Vigilance Asso
ciation. His name used without per
mission or authority."
In view of the questionable tac
tics used by the alien opposition to
the Ku Klux Klan, this information
is not surprising. One of the names
used was that of John Sherwood
Jones of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.
Information from there is that Mr.
Jones is. unknown at Bryn Mawr
College as well as at the Bryn Mawr
postoffice.
Dr. P. L. Campbell, of the Univer
sity of Oregon, located at Eugene,
and who is named on the “list” by
the Vigilance Association, enters a
denial. .He says: “Have no knowl
edge of my name being connected
with National Vigilance Association.
Know nothing of organization other
than through occasional newspaper
paragraphs."
Thus does the gigantic hoax thor
oughly in keeping with that perpe
trated by the alien opposition to the
Klan, in gjving a fake message from
President Coolidge to the press, grow
into volume and once again show to
the world the depths to which those
persons opposing the Ku Klux Klan
will stoop.
Rust Rhees, president of Rochester
University, one of the “members" of
the new organization, in a crypt wire
says: “Use of my name by National
Vigilance Association is unauthoriz
ed.” And yet these men behind the
National Vigilance Association, who
would have all America believe them
to be sincere, use the methods dis
played by them in foisting on the
newspapers of America, a list that
has the very earmarks of having
06en taken from a directory. In the
case of President Aley of Butler Col
lege, this virtuous association used
his name over his protest and after
it had received two letters from him
declaring that he would not be a
member.
This organization, one of the heads
of the hydra-headed, un-American
Unity League, which is sponsored by
Joe Roach, assassin, and Pat O’Don
nell, jury fixer, is evidently follow
ing in the footsteps of its parent or
ganization and heralds its existence
to the world with a lying list of
names of persons, some of whom had
never heard of the organization. Be
ing a part and parcel of the amalga
mated enemies of America, it also
follows in the footsteps erf the
Knights of Columbus, an organiza
tion which, while our late president
was still unburied, sent to the press
!a fake message from the new presi
dent, a message which they after
ward “admitted was a mistake." Now
comes the Vigilance Association with
another fake story and then “admits”
the use of Presiden Aley’s name an
“error.”
Their actions are those of the An
cient Hibernians, an organization
which serves notice on the governor
of Indiana and the President of the
United States that it will “use its"
own methods" to eliminate the Ku
Klux Klan. Possibly the fake list ix
a part of their methods.
Ellen F. Pendleton, president of
Wellesley College, in answer to a
telegram from The Fiery Cross,
wires: “No authorization given for
of name as one of the Incorpora
tors of National Vigilance Associa
tion."
To date only two telegrams have
been received in which the senders
acknowledge their connection with
the National Vigilance Association.
One was from a colored professor in
Wake Forrest, N. C., and the other
from a dignitary of the Roman Cath
olic church in St. Paul, Minn. This
man took pains to qualify . his con
nections as purely one of wishing
law and order. Other answers to
telegrams declare that some of those
listed as “members” have bOen in
Europe for months.
The amalgamated enemies of
America are qow fighting with their
backs to the wall as the Klan con
tinues to be augmented with sterling

ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 1923
redblooded Americans who realize
the menace of the alien interests
that now cast its shadows across the
fair face of our country. The repre
hensible tactics used by the oppo
sition to the Klan, including slander,
lies, faked messages, lyinj* lists, paid
propagandists, assault and battery,
murder and every other scheme* that
can be contrived in the cunning
brains of trained plotters, are only
reacting in favor of the“ Ku Klux
Klan. What explanation can the Na
tional Vigilance Association offer to
the public for printing a list such as
appeared in the daily newspapers?
Possibly it feels that none is needed;
that these organizations of aliens
have so long been faking news and
insulting the of Ameri
cans that the public will stand'for it
and that the men who have been
maligned by fake messages and ly
ing lists have no recourse butk denial
and that these denials will be swal
lowed up in the vast amount of news.
Founded Upon Deceit
The National Vigilance Association
has proved to the world that it' is
founded on deceit; that it has used
the names of prominent men, not
only without authorization but under
protest Of those men, and that every
indication points to the associaion
having used a directory from which
to get the names of their now punc
tured attempt to convince America
that the educators of this country
are against the Klan.
Their entire procedure is that of
the crafty alien who for centuries
past has been steeped in deceit,
schooled in intrigue and drilled in
secret and reprehensive plotting.
The organization burst into print
with a lie and as it has shown no
signs of life it will most probably
be left to lie where it falls.

PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH
W. Rothwell, Minister
Claremont, Minn., Nov. >24, 1923.
I
Dr. Samuel F. Kerfoot,
President Hamline University,
St. Paul, Minn.
Dear Doctor:
It is with deepest regret that I notice in the Minne
apolis Journal of November 13 that you have been named a
jnember of a body the purpose of which is to destroy the
Ku Klux Klan.
Please understand that I hold no brief for the Klan,
- but am at a loss to understand why you should be expected
to lend your aid to overthrow an organization whose only
crime, as far as I can find out is that it is opposed to the
political activities of the Roman Catholic church.
I am the more surprised when I recall that Cardinal'
Daugherty has publicly denounced the work of your own
great Church in Italy; and has accused the Methodists of
being “revilers and seducers” of innocent Italians.. (See
the Protestant of January 23, page 171). That you should
be asked to help destroy those who are opposed to the
Roman Catholic Church’s stranglehold on our political,
educational, and judicial systems is a poor exchange for
the “bouquets” already referred to.
However, if you are of the opinion that the Klan is
unnecessary and that it is guilty of all the things its Roman
Catholic “friends”, (?) say about it, perhaps you can sug
gest something in its place that can be used to further
“law enforcement” which cannot be controlled by the Ro
man Catholic Church.
I presume it is hardly necessary for me to remind
you that the policy of said church, is, and always has been
to either “rule or ruin” it is only because it cannot do the
former that it desires the latter in the case of the Klan.
i wonder what would happen if you were asked to
become a member of a committee to see to it that every
member of 4he Knights of Columbus was asked to with
draw from all the orders named in the article I have already
referred to? - v
Trusting you will maintain the great traditions of the
Meihodist Church by refusing to act on the “National Vigi
lance Commitee. I remain,
Yours tor fair play, v .

Oregon Klansmen Celebrate
TWO SOLID MILES OF MARCHING
MEN THRILL VAST CROWDS
AEROPLANE I
Over 6000 Klansmen were present
at the great state demonstration held
at Salem, November 10. Of that num
ber, 5800 were in full regalia and
took part in the spectacular parade
with masks down.
Several different checks were made
by official observers, and the results
show that the parade was two miles
long. The Klansmen marched four
abreast in columns eights feet apart,
and th°re were 1450 solid lines of
white robed figures in orderly pro
cession. The marchers covered a dis
tance of over five miles.
The parade was led by the Stars
and Stripes and the Fiery Cross.
Following were two Klansmen on
horseback and behind these were ma
chines carrying state officers of the
Klan and Royal Riders of the Red
Robe. Tom Akers, head of the im
perial Klan Intelligence Bureau was
the official representative of Fred L.
Gifford, Grand Dragon for the Realm
of Oregon, who was unable to attend
on account of illness. The Represen
tative of Imperial Regent Royal
Riders of the Red Robe, Grand Klaliff
Grand Kligrapp and Great Titans for
the state, and Exalted Cyclops of local
Klans were also in autos. The ma
chines were followed by a band, of
which there were* three in the entire
parade; one from Eugene, one from
Albany and the Scotch Kiltie band
from Portland.
The Royal Riders were given the
place of honor in the line of march.
Their costumes were electrically il
luminated with tiny light bulbs, and
their red robes made a spectacular
contrast to the''pure white robes of
their Klansmen brothers. Following
the Riders, the Klanlmen marched
four abreast in imposing array. Be
hind them, in machines, were the aged
Klansmen who were unable to stand
the strain of the five-mile line of
march.
The parade would have been aug
mented by several hundred more
Klansmen, but these latter were un-
S A FEATURE
able to secure robes, due to the ex
ceptional demand for them earlier in
the week.
The feature stunt of the evening
was revealed just as the parade
started to move off. At that time
an airplane, flying 1,000 feet over the
dome of the state Capitol, was ob
served by the crowds below, with a
giant Fiery Cross emblazoned on the
wings. The plane circled the Capitol
building several times, and then
started off to follow the entire route
of the parade. Then, from an eleva
tion of 1,000 feet, the aviator climbed
to a distance of 4,000 feet, so that
the cross appeared to be standing
vertically in the air. - It was at this
time that the apparent phenomena of
a Fiery Cross high in fhe heavens
could be plainly seen from Albany, a
Returning to the former elevation,
the sign was changed to the words:
“Join K. K. K.” and the aviator again
circled the city.
The two special trains leaving
Portland were unable -to acommodate
the crowds, and about 50 Klansmen
and women were left behind. The
Fiery Cross was placed" on the £ront
of the first special, when it took on
the crowd at Tenth and Washington.
The Portland Klansmen paraded from
the train at Salem to the state fair
grounds. The Klans were well rep
resented from every Klavern in the
state of Oregon.
The entire facilities of the state
fair grounds were used by the Klans
men and the ladies who attended the
meeting. Aproximately **2,500 meals
were served at the grounds by the
ladies from the combined Protestant
churches cf Salem.
After the parade, the Klavern was
opened in the race track -enclosure
by the Grand Klaliff of Oregon. The
Klansmen were inside the enclosure,
and the grandstand, capable of seat
ing 5,000, was comfortably filled by
spectators. A 40-foot Fiery Cross
was lighted in the race track. The
Royal Riders were given special rec
ognition, and escorted inside the
Klavern to join in the ceremonies.
Speeches were delivered by Tom
Akers, who talked on behalf of Fred
L. Gifford, the Grand Dragon of Ore
gon; V. K. “Bearcat" Allisan, Im
perial Lecturer; the Patrol Chief of
the Royal Riders and J. R. Johnson,
Exalted Cyclops of Portland Klan No.
1, who presented the charter to
Salem Klan.
A large class was initiated by
Salem Klan before the parade. The
initiation was conducted by C. C.
Star, KlEagle of Salem Klan. Star
was in charge of, and directly respon
sible for the entire demonstration,
which was conceded to be the biggest
and best ever held on the Pacific
coast.
The Western American, official
Klan paper for the state, was repre
sented. One member of the staff car
ried a large banner on which were
the words “Read the truth about the
Klan in The Western American, offi
cial paper for the K. K. K., R. R. R.
R., and W. O. K. K. K."
Major Luther I. Powell, KlEagle
for Portland Klan, who was in Salem
also, parcipitated in the parade.
An important past was played by
the Field Marshal of the Salem Klan
who, with 100 aides, policed the
grounds and cared for the hundreds
of machines that were parked near
the race track. y'

Oklahoma City.—Oklahoma will be

Petitions under the initiative law

natures required here before the pro
posed measures can be filed with the
Secretary of State.

Indignant over Blake*s activities,
intended to force Knights of the Ku
Kulx Klan to dispense with their
regulation uniforms, Klansmen and
Protestants in general are preparing
to “hit back” by introducing the
measure which will abolish parochial
schools in the Sooner State.
The measure has ben drawn up
by leading attorneys of the Invisible
Empire and is said to be “air tight”
and will stand all constitutional at
tacks made upon it.
It provides for the compulsory at
tendance at the public schools of all
children until they have finished the
eighth grade.
Admit Klan Can Do It.
The power of the Klan in such an
initiative petition possibly would be
greater than with any proposition
that might be advanced by the Invis
ible Empire. It iwould not be neces
sary to go outside the Empire in Ok
lahoma to obtain the required 42,000
signatures to place the measure on
the ballot and put it to a vote.
The bill also would have the back
ing of thousands of Protestants, not
Klansmen, who are opposed to paro
chial schools.
A similar petition was launched
two years ago, but the plan was not
decided upon until too late to cir
culate the petitions and collect the
required number of signatures to
place he question on the ballot.
“Beat Minnesota to It,” Cry of
Oklahoma
While similar school measures have
been getting under way in Michigan,
Ohio, and Indiana for more than a
year, it. appears that Oklahoma will
beat the others to the honor of being
the second state to make public
schools paramoun.
This step was first accomplished
two years ago in Oregon, when the
measure was submitted to a vote of
the people and adopted by a large
majority.
The fact that the measure carried
at the time that Klansmen were
swept into Sffice leads many to be
lieve the bill was sponsored by the
hooded organization. This has never
ben denied by the Klan, although the
petitions were circulated under the
name of the American Liberty
League.
As a fact, Masonry led in the Ore
gon movement and supports the plan
elsewhere, as it will here.
As soon as Oklahoma obtains the
required number of signatures (and
it is predicted that will take less than
twq weeks) the bill will be filed with
the secretary of state and probably
resul in its being voted on not later
than next November.

Self Appointed Dictator Declared
Incompetent Among Many

—K-K-K—
--(By Staff Correspondent))
Oklahoma City, Okla. —A Glutton
for punishment, former Governor
Jack Walton, self-appointed czar of
Oklahoma, has now signified hi% in
tention of taking his fight to retain
the governorship of Oklahoma to the
Supreme Court of the United States.
Ousted by a unanimous vote of the
legislature, the arrogant former en
gineer still persists in continuing his
fight which was lost before it was
started.
Not for one minute forgetting the
dramatic, he, on last Friday engag
ed in more theatricals by leaving the
senate during the trial after engaging
in a lurid speech in which he denounc
ed the “unfairness” of the trial.
This merely marked another “high
spot” in his sensational career both as
mayor of Oklahoma City and gover
nor of this state. It is expected that
his case, if he insists on continuing
his hopeless fight, will go before the
U. S. court some time next month.
Machine Guns Recalled
Walton’s worst enemies admit his
fine sense of the dramatic. Now that
his race is run they recall its high
spots—how he won the farmers by his
overall campaign, the mammoth bar
becue, still unpaid for, the machine
guns trained on the court house and
the statement credited to the gover
nor that “he would tell the people
when to go to bed” and that the legis
lators “would ride through blood to
their bridle bits” if they tried to con
vene against his orders.
Walton’s career has been merely a
series of sensations which died a dis
mal death when absolutely no de
fense was presented for on the many
charges preferred against him. He
was found guilty on eleven charges
of the sixteen presented by the leg
islature. The removal vote stood
forty-one to nothing, and npon his re
moval as governor of the state, Lieu
tenant-Governor Trapp became the
state's chief executive.
, How the Voting Stood
The other votes taken by the legis
lature were as follows:
That he exceeded his pardon and
parole powers. Vote, 41 to 0.
That he placed his personal chauf
feur on the state health department
pay r 011—35 to 6.
That he padded the state pay roll
—3B to 3.
That he prevented the assembling
of a grand jury—39 to 1.
That he suspended the right of the
writ of habeas corpus—4o to 1.
That he issued a SIO,OOO deficiency
certificate for the state health de
partment when no deficiency existed
—37 to 4.
That he issued a deficiency certifi
cate for $4,000 for a state negro or
phans’ home in order to provide sal
aries for two negro barbers whom
he ordered placed on the pay roll of
the institution—4o to 1.
That he attempted to prevent a
special state election to be held Oct.
2—37 to 8.
That he excelled the legal limit
of election expenses—2B to 13.
That he solicited gifts and con
tributions for expenses of his office
after he was elected —Unanimous.
Is Voted Incompetent
That he is generally incompetent
—36 to 4.
The charges on which he was ac
quitted were:
That he used his official position to
obtain personal property and credit
—23 to 18. (Lacking the necessary
two-thirds majority to convict.)
That he received a $60,000 bribe
to approve an appropriation for a
state business academy—26 to 14.
That he refused to permit the ex
ecution of the law providing capital
punishment—M. to 30.
That he illegally named a large
number of known criminals and ir
responsible persons as state police—
-24 to 17.
That he illegally named Charles
