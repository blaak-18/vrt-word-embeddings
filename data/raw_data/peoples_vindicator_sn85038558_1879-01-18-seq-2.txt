that arrests have been made of par

of the times, and his open, candid and
intellhgant expression ef opinion in re
lation to the political situation of the
resent time was highly edifying to
us and in full accord with onr views.
As he correctly insists this is the crisis
in the history of our State, and eovery
thing pertaining to our redemption
and future prosperity depends upon
the immediate action of our present
represontatives in pushing forward
the necessary reforms by rcmodling
the State government, which it is the
policy of our enemies to prevent by
advocating delay; with the probable
hope and prospect of defeating these
reforms by the interferance of Feder
at authority through the Federal elec
tions of next year.
We learn. however, from all sources
that our reprersentatives are firm and
will adhere strictly to their pledges
andl the expressed will of the peoIple
upon these subjects, and that the con
vention will be ordered to be held in
April next, to be followed by an elec
tion to fill all the offtlices of the state
under the new constitution next fall.
This will enable the people to Ihave I
fair election conducted and controlled
by our own State authorities unltranm
twelled by the unjust and arbitrary
interference of Fedrral officers under
the pretense of regulating the election
ot Federal offtlicers, as was the case in
our last election.
We concur ifully with the editor of
the Vindicator in sustaining the nco
ble and patriotic course of the New
Orleans Democrat in its defence of the
cauose of Democracy, and appeal
to the people to rally to its sup
port. It has certainly merited
the patronage of all true friends of
reform, of the alosns which have
ruined and prostrated the interests
and prosperity of Louisiana. We are
legaly indebted to the hold and inde.
pendent position which they have
taken in behalf of the cause of De
mobcracy, for our present success, :und
which has provoked so much virualence
and persecution by the opposition. at
the present time to tlhei excelent jour
nal. Therefore we say to the ptople,
sustain your State paper, the chain
pion of the people antid the death knell
of tyranny an(d Radicalism.
The Teller Show.
There is in session at the Cnstom
House in this city, a conmmnittee of
the United States Senate, composed
of the Republican Senators Teller,
Camueron and Kirkwood iand the )eu,
oeratic Senators Bailey and Garland.
The majority of this committeo is
Republican, and hencie controls its
action entirely. As if by preconcert
ed arrangement with the United
States district attorney, a large num
ber of witnesses had been subpmnaed
before the United States grand jury'
from the remote country parishese.
SThese witnesses, of course, are Re
publican. There is no notice to the
Democrats of this investigation, hence
no opportunity given to rebut the
malicious, drilled Custom-couse wit.

fronted with his accusers. Here it is
reversed, for the accused people are

A little whisky keg labeled Hlornd
emoves about the Custom-House, pre
pares the puns and boa mots for the
African clowns, while Teller, as
skillful ring-master, is careful that
no rude interruption shall take place,
in the shape of questions, to test
whether there is the shadow of a

I the expense of the government. The
funds for the committee were surrep.
titiously abstracted from another ap
propriation. The fables and Mua.
chasen tales are occasionally relieved
by pious ejacula ions of the clowns.
lBehgion is made to take its part in
this verbiage of stulf. No wonder
rmany of the performers retire from
the ring dripping with perspiration
from their exploits. Although web
I drilled for the ocasilon, like other
I performers, they occasionally, make a
slip in tbe parts. Like that winess

A member of the committee noti

refused to give. Teller saw the dis

unneosaeery. Mr. Cameron, however,
thought that the witness had said so
much hoe mlht as well tell all, and
then the witness gave the name.
Mr. Teller will keep on with his

at the first opportunity, and its pas
sage in tlhe House is considered as
suredc. Tile joint committee of the
