STUPENDOUS FOLLY.
A PROPOSITION AS DAMNABLE
AS DISGUSTING,
A Bankitg and Carrency Sysrer Pro
posed by the Hankers at their late
Sessioun eld in Atlanta, Oa.-For
Infamy It 14 Un'xcellels
The persistency w:th which the
banking interests of the country pur
sue their object of complete suprem
acy, is one of the marvels of the age.
Never was a people more helplessly
in the clutches of a pirate band. than
is the American people to-day.
Everything now indicates that there
is nothing whatever to hinder their
triumphal march over the bodies of
their crushed and ruined victims, in a
land laid bare by the relentless hand
of robbers.
Their victory tiii place the entire
business interests of the country at
the mercy of the nmoit defiant gang of
black-hearted pirates that ever exist
ed on earth.
Heretofore a jealousy among threm
selves regarding the division of the
resulte of their plunder has prevented
a concert of action.
No lack of sentiment existed as to
the object to be outained, as every
banker's meeting has fully attested,
but a plan which would satisfy fully
the bloodthirsty demands of the whole
crew, has been more difticult to devise.
Now, howeter, it is believed thal
the problem has been solved.
At the late bankers' meeting in At
lanta a plan was developed which un
doubtedly reaches the acme of perfec
tion in this one res ct.
For infamy and asa legalised sys
tem of high handed robbery. 'twould
be without a parallel in the history of
the world.
It will be remembered that a year
ago these bankers at their meeting in
Blaltimore Trot up a plan.
That plan provided for banks every
where throughout the country having
authority to issue circulating notes.
based on their capital stock, such
notes to be guaranteed by the govern
ment.
Naturally enough this led to discus
sion as to what capital stock might
actually be.
Discussion on this point only em
phasizes the fact that it too often rep
presents nothing whatever of value.
Nothing but bits of pqper, printed
perhaps in letters of gold, but often
times more worthless than if abso
lutely blank.
Yet for all this, it was at that titmec
seriously proposed that these should
be ahe basis for every dollar of cu'
renoey that would be used as a medium
of exchange in the greatest nation on
earth.
Why did this plan fail?
Merely because the secretary of the
treasury, inspired by the power of
Wall street, believed that a better
scheme of robbery could be invented.
That plan contained no definite propo
sition for robbing the people of what
money they had in the United States
treasury except by requiring the gov
ernment to pay it out in the redemp
tion of notes of broken banks.
The plan, as ifamous as it was,
was not so infamous as what was to I
follow.
The secretary of the treasury rec- I
omended that the plan be modified,
making the banks mutually responsi- i
ble for the failures that occur.
That ended the Baltimore plan.
It weret folly to contemplate a
scheme where the only possible inorn
tive to activity would be to sea which
one oeaLd break first
The preent scheme however is au
complete modifleation of any plan
ever propoeed in this country.
Its author, Mr. Bradford Rhodes o:
the 'Journal of Banking." states that
it is the same as the Bank of England
would be. if its business was reduced
to its issue department He outlines
the features of the proposition as fol- I
lowa:
,,The idea is to have a bank char
terd by bonlress conlned to the one
Ifeotion of issulog circulating otes.
Thse note areto be issued in the
redisoouat of commerail paper of
fered to it by the banlks of the coun
try, state, national and private. All
other beaks are to be prohibited from
isuing circulation notes.
*"The new bak is to obtain its re
servesu rst, by the subscription of a
capital of 0,00t0,000; secoond, by the
Issue of its circulating notes lan ex
obehage for legal tender and treasury
notes and told. These laete os ad
gold are to.be held as a reeserve for
she payment of all it notes. Tble re

se eiw abasw 1 1 **
we to ve nd
over again what Mr. Rhodes says and
carefully consider each paragraph and
weigh the importance of each propo.
sition.
It will be observed that the trans.
actions of ordinary banks, doing busi
ness on the money of depositors, A ill
not be interfered with; in fact, will be
facilitated by the bank of issue.which
is always ready to become a pur
chaser of commercial paper.
The great central bank with its nu
merous branches throughout the coun
try would have no need of deposits.
The provision for its supply of fund
is the most ample that ,an be imn
agined.
An issue of a million dollars in
notes, would draw from the treausury
a million doilars in money. and this
money becomes a reserve, on hiicl.
the issue of at least three million dol
lar is is authorizeld.
When this Is exhausted the opera.
tion can be repeated indefinitely so
long as there is a dollar in the treas
ury, or while the taxing power of tie
government can secure money.
Could any scheme for obtaining cur
rency be more perfect:
Note the fact that it is all based on
subscription of twenty million dollars.
No provision roquiriun any actual
capital.
The reserve is to be money drawn
from the treasure with notes issued
b_ this bank.
For every dolar to dra:wn :',rn
the government thrce dotiars ;- to ite
used in rediscountinu the c(om:ner :ai
paper by the ordinary banks of thel
country. -
Under these circumstances, of
course It is easier to have the govern
ment furnish new notes than to ac
cept deposits. So the old plan of or
dinary bankers doing business on the
funds furnished by depositors will
continue.
This settles a contentiou which has
long existed in banking circles.
E.very one now will conduct his til
ibustering utnrestricted and unre
strained.
There will be no national banks
skirmishing for deposits under the
false plea of being more safe than
others.
There will be no trouble at any
time to rodiscount all the notes of
hand that can be secured from the
farmers and business men.
These and various other reasons
will guarantee the endorsement of
bankers everywhere.
Mr. Rhodes in his argument favor
ing the plan says:
"'Suchl an institution would at once
relieve the government and reform
the currency. The bank would re
;,uire a large portion of the legal ten
uer and treasury notes as reserves."
It is biupily astonishing that any
man, in apparent candor can urge
such an infamous p,:oposition, much
,!es (all it reforming the currencyv.
lie further says: .
S'lhe silver cortiiicates could be
made exchangeable for the bank notes
and thus afsr the withdrawal of the
other goe'crnmeret notes they would
always remain at par. Eventually the
bank could tase in hand the silver
bullion now owned by the govern.
men t."
Now if our readers will justgo over
this carefully they will gather an
idea of what congress will have
on hand this winter under
the pretense of currency reform.
It might be well enough to take
into consideration what the probable
outcome will be when all the coins.
legal tenders. treasury notes and ever.
the silver bullion has passed from the
treasury Into the. hands of a Wall
street gang whose basis is merely a
subscription of twenty million dollars
capital stock.
Could a more infamous schemet be
concocted ?
It contemplates the most gigantic
robbery that has ever blackened the
pages of history.
This scheme of knavery as infamous
as It is, will receive endorsements
from the subsidized press of the na
tion.
The presentation of the matter as
given by Mr. Rhodes in his "Journal"
will reach very few outside of the
press or those engaged in banking.
A majority of themse will see per.
sonal advantage to accrue from -its
adoption, while millions of voters will
coatinue to regard flnance as too la
tricate a problem for the ordinary
mied.
- As it looks now the plan will likely
go lato history as an sacoomplished
fact and will be the beginlning of the
ead.

Brother laboring man, do you know
how we would howl and groan if we
had no vote, and boast to our wife
and children how quickly we would
right our wrongs if we had a vote?
How we would boast of what we would
do if we had a chance to help elect
our public officers?
We have that power now. We
have had it ever since we were old
enough to vote. Are we too dumb to
use that power for our own good?
Have we brains, or are our heads
stuffed with sawdust?
One thing is certain: we have our
heads stuffed with prejudice and polit
ical iguorance. We even let our re
ligious vi ws come between us and
our toiling brother. It is time to
drop all such nonsense. Liberty on
earth is equal to pardon in heaven.
If we can't be men here. we can't be
angels elsewhere.
Do not let us run to meet Debs with
as much prejudice and ignorance as
we did six months ago. Let us show
him that we have been learning many
a vital lesson since they led him off
to Woodstock jail. Let us show him
that we still believe it is no crime to
fight the battles of God's miserable
children, in spite of the opinion of
presidents and chuckle-headed judges;
and that liberty is but a bubble to the
man who fears to speak his honest
convictions.
