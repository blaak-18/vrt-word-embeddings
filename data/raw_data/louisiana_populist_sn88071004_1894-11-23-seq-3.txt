Paul Conrad, of Honduras lot
tery fame, is dead.
The impeachment proceedings
against the New Orleans mayor,
-khn Fitzpatrick, is slowly dragy
gimg its way through the courte,
and some time in the sweet bye
aad bye we will know the ontoome.
Legislative proceedings against
boodlers and eorrupt oicials down
South is tardy and expensive, and
for the good it does should be abol
ished. By making retributive jus
tice swift and certain, we would
soon be rid of sneh men as the
mayor of New Orleans ad his
gang.
The coutmntry and the people are
sufering from organied tfraud and
corruption. The only way to
overcome these evils is by organi
ed pariot..... and honesty. The
old prti-s represent the former.

trip last Thursday.
MORlE ANON.
Bread Riot. ...
CHICAGO, Nov. 17.-A large 06
tail of police was called outs at noon
to-day to quell a bread riot in the
city hall. Two hundred and fifty
discharged employes of the water
department gathered about the
Comptroller's office and demanded
the wages due them.
The Comptroller sent a clerk to
inform the men that there was no
money in the city treasury to pay
them. Instantly the crowd became
riotous. Cries of bread and threats
of instant vengeance were howled
forth by the angry crowd and the
Comptroller, gathering his clerks
barred the doors to his office and
sent a hurried call for policemen.
A half dozen officers appeared but
were promptly rushed out of the
corridors by the thoroughly arous
ed men. A battallion of patrflmen
was summoned and after a liberal
use of force the rioters were club
bed into submission and driven
from the city hall. The large
crowd which had been.attracted by
the disturbance was heartily in
sympathy with the ex-employes
and threats to compel instant pay
ment of the overdue wages were
numerous until the police succeed
ed in dlislpersing the throng.
Civlo Pride.
The Monroe News gives the defti
nition of civic pride in these words:
"Civic pride is that condition of
public spirit which makes every
citizen, little and big, proud of the
home city. It fosters and devel
ope everything which makes a town
worth living in; it tolerates no
croakers and no dissensions. Where
it exists none of the little jealous
ies and none of the prejudlices
which obtain in most small towns
are allowed to stand in the way of
municipal progress. Everybody
has a good word for every public
or business eterprise. Every
body feel-apsersnasl interest in all
things whieh go to make the town
bdgger mad better."

Blaine Taught Populism.
James G. Blaine, in referring to
the fight to kill silver as money of
redemption, used these prophetic
words on the floor of the house,
February 7, 1s78 :
"I helieve the struggle now going
on in this country and other coun
tries for a single standard, would,
if successful, produce wide-spread
disaster in and throughout the
commercial world. The destruc
tion of silver as money and the es
tablishment of gold as the sole
unit of va;lne, must have a ruinous
effect upon all forms of prosperity,
except those investments which
yield a fixed return in money.
Those would be enormously en
hanced in value and wouhl gain a
disproportionate and untair advan
tage over every other species of
Iproperty. If, as the most reliable
statistics affirm, there are nearly
$7,000,0M(),100 of coin or bullion in
the world not very unequally divi
ded between gold and silver, it is
impossible to strike silver out of
existence as money without results
that will prove distressing to Inil
lions and utterly disastrous to tens
of thousands."
The Populists charge that in
Madison parish the books show
1016 names of duly registered vot
ers, and that on this official regis
tration a majority for Boatner of
2000 was returned on the 6th inst.
If this be true the "boys" overdid
the business, and in the absence of
proper inquiry by the grand jury
Benoit and his friends should ex
pose the frauds and every man con
nected with it. The Item believes
in democratic principles, and be
lieves in upholding them, but
draws the line at ballot box stuf
ting. If the democratic .party has
beedhie so weak in numbers that
its edmlidates have to depend for
election upon such methods, we
say lit all candor, let the other fel
lows have pull at thi teat. We be
rev' one term of sti-demrocratic
rltrWoculd bring the people around
all tight again, and with new lead
ers they weuld stwhtg" tte old State
back,4nto the line nwhere 8uch mete
as Wlckliffe, - lerron and hosts of
other true ,and tried democratic
Iatricta held her in days gone by.
A fairaid honiest expression of the
peopipa will, through the ballot
box, must be respected.-.Capital

We wish to call the attention of our
readers, who wish to take.a great na
tlonal paper, great in every depart
ment, tO the American Nonconformist.
No Populist paper has so many able
eorrespondents or so large a circulation.
And it4 success is deserved, as no ex
pense is spared to make it the best,
most reedable paper in the country.
The fraud and rascality (winked at and
nunpublished by the old party papers),
uanestrthed and exposed by its Washing
ton cormspondents during the last ses
sion of congress was a revelation to
every honest man. Its scathing and
fearless editorials are a terror to evil
doors. Every one of our readers who
wishes the mews of the whole Populist
movement -should subscribe for this
great paper. Price $1.00 a year. Send
direet to Indianapolis, Ind. Sample
