.tan. 1. 1876,
Communication from tha Gov
ernor of New York .
EXECUTrriv CiralAMIR,
Albany, January 12, 1875.
To the Leglsisutre :
On your re-assembling, I deem it
my duty to invite your attention to
the grave eve events which have ha pen
ed in our sister. State of Louisiana.
The interval of your adjournwent has
offered you an opportulity to receive
the statelents of the parties concern
ed in those occurrences, particularly
that of Lieutenant-General Sheridan,
in his official report to the SecretaIry
of War, dated January 8th, 1875.'
You are now enabled to know with
certaint.y all the facts necessary to
form a just ,nd :lelerate judj& i t
as to the nature of the principal acts
which have created so much publlie
excitement.
According to the official Roport of
Lieutenant-General Sheridan, the
United States soldiers entered the
House of Representatives of the State
of Louisiana, while that bocly was in
session, and removed from it five of
its tnenmbers.
The pretexts of this act are :
First--That it was done under di
rection from the Governor of the
State, recognized by the - President.
Secoud-That the persons removed
"llhad been illegally heated," and '"had
no legal right to be there."
Third--That a fear existed in the:
mind of, Lieutenant-General Slier
idan that, in soune undefined contin
gency, violence might happen.
With respect: to the first and second
of these pretekts, it is' a decisive an
sw;r-that ,tl;eLouisiana. House of
Representatives had, by the Consti
tution of that Stihte, the exclusive
judgminnt as to the right of these
members to seats; that its judgment
is suijct to no review by any judi
cial authority, still less a review by
the Governor or by any officer of the
United States Army; that its judg
menrt in favor of these memlbers thus
forcibly removed is binding 'in law,
snd conclusive upon the, Governor
and Lieutenant-General Sheridan,
and upon every other-person.
In respect to the third pretext, the°
fear in the mind of Lieutenant Gen
eral Sheridan of possible, future vi
olence, when no violence really ex
isted, is not only no lawful occasion,
but not even an excuse for an inva
sion of the gight of the House of Re
presentatives of Louisiana to judge
for itself of the title to seats of its
own members.
Interference by United States sol
diers was not only unlawful, but it
was without the color of legality. It
was an act of nake.l physical force in
violation of the laws and constitution
of Louisiana, null of the laws and
constitution of the United States.
There is a case of a dispulted seat in
the Senate of this State now pend
ing. Another was determined at the
last session. Tile transaction in
Louisiant is as if, at the instance of
the Governor of this State, General
Hancock, commanding the depart
ment, or an oftlicer especially deputed
by the President, should send a file
of Federal soldiers and remove the
incumbent to whom tlhe seat had
been adjudged by the Senate.. That
disorders have formerly existed in
Louisiana makes no difference. For
the laws-to which the President and
Congress are parties-recognize tlhe
complete restoration of her autonomy.
The right of her legislative bodies :o
determine the title of their mnmnbers
is as perfect and absolute as the right
of the Assembly of the State of h'ew
York.
Thile animus of the transaction as
indicated by the correspondeInce be
tween Lieutesant-General Sheridan
and the Secretary of War, is infinit
ely worse than the transaction itself.
On the day after the event, Lient
enant-General Sheridan sent a dis
patch proposing that a class of citiz
ens, indefinite in number and des
cription, should be declared, either
by Act of Congress or by proclanma
tion of the President, to be banditti
and thed :indicates his purpose to try
them and execute them by military
commission. On the next day Gel.
Belknap, the Secretary of War, tole
'graphed to.General- Sheridan: thiat
"Tlhe President and all -of-a hire
faull confidence-.in, and thoroughly aIp
prove your course."
The nature of the acts, tlhus pro
posed1;by the officer second in colm
mang -of the army of the United
States,.amt thus,adopted and sane
tioned ,by the President and his con
stitutional nadvisers, is plainly de
clared by the common law. .
In the recen, case of the. Queen v.
nlson andl rd, the lrenOt Lord
Chief' Jtti% ngland', i'i,t1iveri 'i 1
the . charge te the Grai.d Jtry, de-.
creei 'that, "stippostilg that therye':i
no jurisdicrish tit il, that thei whole
proceeding is ccarni' now .Jdike, that
the judicial iun'tions -ae .exercised
by persons who have' .o' '"Jdicial
authorit- ot rpower, aiid a diki's life
is takeon, t)liit is nimurder; for murde8i
is puttirig'a 'iint to death withoit a
justification', or'without any of those
mitigating circumi'tances whicb re
dnce the crime of norder to one of a
lower degree. Thus, jn the case put
-by L~htd Coke 'of a lieutenant - having
a commission iff martial lhst in time
of peace, thdt, says Ldtd Coke, is
murder.5
Such are the established doctrines
of the jurists and courts of this eoun
try and of England. Such is the
voice of common law-glorious juris
prudence of freedom! birthright of
every American eltizsed I Its stern
logic declares that sau!s an execution
of any human being, as was proposed
and sanctioned in this correspon
dence, would be mnrde~' by our laws;'
and that every functionary-civil or
mliitaT--whio should insatigate it,
aid or abet it, or become, in any man
ner, a party: to -it before .the fact,
would be guilty as a principal in that
crime.
The patriot statesmartn who achieved
otrn national independence,maid fernt
ed our institutions of free gover_4
ment, foreboded, if we should evry
fall in' intestine strife, that ihe idea it
would inspiie in military 'mtids--of
insubordination to the laws and of
uncivij ambition-and .the. habit it
Iwouhl generate in the ,pgple, of ac
quiescence in ats' of unlawful mil
itary violence-w'odld impleril,' it iot

closed, we are made sensible of the
wise forbsigiht of the foiniders bf our;
freedom in thel witrniing' of the op
posite ;dan ers which woold attend
our success. Those dangers conme to
'us in acts of illegal military violence,
coinmitted in time of peace-in the
usurpation by the ohldiery of a power
to decide the mnenmbershlip) of our leg
islative assemblies, whose tight to
judge exclusively in such cacs, has
ever been guarded with peculiair jeal
ousy by' our. race-in the proposal,
made and accepted by our highest
civil and military functionaries. to
subject our citizens to tribunals ih
which a military oficer will decide,
withoiutappeal; whltat persons, hap
peniug to be found in the locality.
shall be sent to them for trial-will
lappoint the members of the court
will review and confirm or change the
judgment and sentence-and may or
der instant executions, and in which
the accused will be tried in secret,
and without counsel for his defense.
This proposition is 'thus made, and
thus sanctioned, notwithstanding that,
for similar acts, our English ancestors
sent the first Charles to the scatild
and expelled the' second James from
the throne-; and our o0rn forefathers
--exhiled by. kindred tyrannies and
planting freedom, in the, Wilderness
were careful to iusert inu. our .onsti
tution, positive "pr6hibitions 'against
the application td alv but tiilitary
persins of such tribunals.
Unless such a proposition, so made
and so sanuctioued, shall be condemn
ed bx a publlic reprobation which
Hrill make itmemnorable as a warn
ing to all future officers of the State
and thle army, the decay of the jeal.
ous spirit of freedom, the loss of our
ancestral tradition of liberty, acquired
through ages of conflic& acquiesence
in the maxims and the practices of
tyranny, will have realized the fears
of Washington, and Jay, and Clinton,
and their compatriots.
New York, first of the common
wealths of the American Union, in
population, in resources, and in mil
itary power, shuld .declare her sen
timents, on this occasion, with a dis.
tinctness, a dignity and a solemn em
ph:asis, which 'will command the
thoughtful attention of Congress, of
her sister States, and of the people of
our whole country. With . the same
unainmity with which she upheld the
arms of the Union in the past con
flict, she should now address herself
to the great and most sacred duty of 1
re-establishing civil liberty and the
perAonal rights of individuals, of res
toringthe ideas and habits of fret
domn, and of.reassertit j.the supremha
cy pf the civil authority over the mlil
itary power throughout the Republic.

-Mr. Illaine's Cercial tet. It proveil t
hini to be a. sharp, but not a great

stoop to stir the embers of sectional t

I Mr. Blaine has, also, narrowly es- c

"In ott ease are some tiny gar. 0

though this may seent rather poor

The argultient of Eureka ('eluh
17th), with regard to feeding hogs all
thiey canil be tIIado to eat, is nto doubC
sioinud in generall; that is whent the
object is to raise pork as quickly and
cheaply as possible. With breedinii
stock, however, a different course .
tilmust be liipursued, or they will become
too fat to be good mlothers or milk
ers. Breeding sows should be kept
in good, thrifty condition, should not
be kept too closely conlined until
near fuarrowing, and by all means
should not be allowed to become fat,
The popular breed here is the York
shire. There are two kinds, the
smaller being much like the Suo'olksl
but hardier; the linger breed is long
bodied, large, and yet line-boned and
thin-skinnred. There is a pre.judice
here against black breeds,.which, I
believe, is quite unfounded, but in
breeding pigs to sell we have to ca=
ter to the public taste.
Early Tomatoes.-To g4t early to,
tuatoes, says a writer oni the subljecti
you must, as soon as your tomato
plant has made four leaves, pinch the
tolp bud from the stem, then take up
the plant, pinch off two inches from
the top root and transplant it in a
common hox-frame, whlere the soil is
rich and loamy. The blox will keep
off the wi'nd, and the plants sownl
and growni there eighteen inches apart
will produce fruit two Weeks sooner
than the same planted in the open
ground. A mat. or a few boards,
spread over the trtame at night, will
keep them from frost, and this is far
eilsier and quiclier than going over a
field nightly and setting boxes over'
each hill. As soon as the plants have
set fruit ;on .two blossoms of each
branch, and the top has grown, two
to four leaves, pinching off the ends
of each branch and top should be
again put in practice.
Measuring Corn in tile Ear.-Takn

Tlhis rule gives thirty eight huliJred
and eighty eight cubid inches to the

measulring coonlnoliii, good corn. If
tihe corn he very good, make a pro
per aldditioin for tile same; Iut if it
be light (as it generally is this year),
make a due snbtraction. If we have
a crib of corn to measure in the ear,
tlhat is ten feet in the clear each way
