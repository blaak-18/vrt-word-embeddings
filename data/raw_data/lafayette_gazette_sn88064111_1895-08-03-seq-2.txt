Times Democrat. -i o
A new car "encder has been 'invented by t*
Mr. Hilblert-L. Falk, of this city, which he
claims to-;b 'ltter than any now on the n
market.  broug'ht a model to The Times- P y
Demaocrat.office yesteiday. It is to project
about three feet in front of the car, and can c
be detached P4a; used on either end. _ g
The n~m fiature of the invention is that
it can'be dbopped to a level of the radls by
means of spring, which is worked by the s
motorman in exactly the same way as the
gong is. The fender is made of rubber, S
ad* ordinarilyis six inches above the rails,
but by means of two powerful springs it is
made to shoot outward and slide along the t
rails in front of the car. Underneath the i
rubber is placed a set of steel brushes which F
operate to prevent anything getting below c
the fender. When anything is struck by. a
the car the rubber will act as a shovel and
throw it on to the fender. Mr. Falk is v
making one of these fenders out of brass,
and he intends to make a present of it to the
Traction company. The patent has been
applied for.
Mr. Falk is the inventor of the electric
dynamo which requires no steam for its
operation, a description of which was pub- 5
lished some time ago in The Times- Demo
crat.
Mr. Falk is backed by Mr. N. P. Moss,
one of the wealthiest men of the parish.

s "Walk two hours every day; sleep seven
hours every nighti go to bed always alone,
if you need to sleep; get up as soon as you
wake; work as soon as you get up; eat only
when you are hungry, and drink only when
you are thirsty; and eat and drink always
slowly.
",Never speak except when it is necessary, 1
and never say more than half of what you
think. Never write anything that you can
Y not sign, and never do anything that you
cannot avow. Never forget that others will
count upon you, and that you must never
count upon them. Value money at its real
worth, neither more nor less. It is a good
servant, but a bad master.
"Keep away from women until you are
twenty, and avoid them when you are forty.
Never attempt to produce anything without
a thorough understanding of that which you
y undertake, and destroy as little as possible.
y Pardon everybody beforehand, to be on the
safe side. Do not despise men; do not
hate them, and do not laugh at them beyond
measure. Pity them.
"Think of death every morning when you
a see the light, and every evening on the ap
proach of darkness. When your sufferings
are great look your grief in the face; it will
console you itself and teach you something.
h Try to be simple, to become useful, to re
main free, and before denying God wait un
til somebody proves to you that iHe does not
exist.
"Y For a man and for a woman there is a
succession of duties to be fulfilled which en
ables them to look always ahead and to be
come accustomed to the absence of the ob
jects of their most dear affections. The
world would finish too quickly if the first
i. child was not able to survive the death of
the first mother.
"Misfortunes and trials attack noble souls
without hurting them. They are like the
,s ro}-ks of granite that the sea covers in times
of tempest with its furious waves, fancying
tt that it is drowning them, while it is merely
washing them, so that they reappear again
in the sunlight more polished and more shin
s ing than ever. Adversity embellishes,those that
it cannot cast down. By the law of nature
a man should have many children, lie
h should raise them well, so that they may be
useful; and he should love them, so that
they may be happy. To get married when
a man is young is healthy; to choose, in no
matter what class, a good, honest girl; to
love her with all his heart and soul, and to
smake her a reliable companion and a proli
fic mother; to work to raise his children,
11 and to leave them when dying the example
of his life--that is the true meaning and ob
ject of life; the rest is only error, crime, or
e folly.
"In truth, the average man is only above
11 ambient humanity on one single plane, vir
tue; and, as there can be no virtue, without
f humanity, those alone have the right to con
sider themselves the superiors of others to
whom they acknowledge that they are supe
s rior is denied. Talent, and especially its
hr igher form called genius, is involuntary.
It is not the result of the efforts of man; it
!s is, like beauty, the gift of God. That is
c why it is of secondary order; and posterity
will only rememnber it for its virtue, its sin
- cerity, and its communion in universal pro
gress. Glory for glory's sake is a shametul
speculation.
f "'The men who rejoice in their celebrity
are simpletons; thie men who are proud of
their genius are fools.
3f "There is one thing that is especially
e beautiful in great and pure affections, and
that is that, after the pleasure which they
n afford has passed away, there remains the
s happiness of their recollection.
"Very often an unexpected grief of an un
o merited misfortune gives to a mian an energy
Sand a perseverance which he could never
filnd ill happiness. And after such trials a
Sman often becomes superior who would have
Sremained simple and vulgar if he had always
been happy. He who is without energy
in when young will never have it. Grit is not
Id a winter fruit; it never grows in snow.
"One may expect everything from a mant

systematic trading tlhrotgh Chicago brokers, make large amount. eS-cry year. ranging from a few thou
,and dollars tor the tan aho invest. a hundred or two Ihndred dollars up to 5o,ooo to $o100,000 ooor more

plan are persons -,l-ho live away from Chicago and invest through brokers who thoroughly understand
systematic trading.
