The Great Eastern Shoe Co.
This name sounds large. We started small with a large name,
and we ha.ye grown now until we are above all others in the shoe
business. In other words, we are to the shoe business what Jef
ferson was to the Democratic party in his day.
HE WAS ALL GOLD, and never tarnished. Our shoes are
all leather, and will wear.
We give you Below a Few Prices on Some
of our Leading Shoes:
Our Greta Hand Sewed Calf and Vici Congress and Bals cap
and plain toes at $2.75, are as good as most shoes sold now-a-days
at $3.50, and we put our $3.50 and $4.00 line of Gents’ shoes
against any $5.00 or $6.00 line made today.
Our Ladies’ Department.
Our $1.75, $2.00 and $2.50 shoes are simply superb.
And in Boys’, Misses and Children’s shoes we carry a tremen
dous stock of good shoes, and at low prices.
Our stock of Hats is simply wonderful. We carry a line of
good Fall Hats from SI.OO up to Jno. B. Stetson’s best grade.
And now, a word in regard to our wholesale department: We
do say, and with confidence, and believe wo can give a merchant
the best selected stock of the best selling goods of any house in
Georgia.
