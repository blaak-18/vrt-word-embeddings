THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE OTHERWISE,
AND A FEW LACONICS
THE COST AND RESULTS OF
JURY TRIALS.
“There are more than a hundred
and fifty applications for clemency
now pending before the prison
board, fifty of which are murder
cases. It is a well-known fact that
every murder case is now appealed
to the prison commission before the
sentence of the law is executed,’’
says the Blackshear (Ga.) Times.
The Saurday Evening Post said
editorially, referring to the great
need of judicial reform:
“The great fault lies in unlimited
right of appeal upon trivial techni
calities. A case is carried up and
reversed on some small and palpable
clerical error or because of a ruling
on a fine-spun point of legal eti
quette which would in no wise affect
substantial justice. We find Justice
Brewer, of the United States Su
preme Court, quoted as saying: ‘The
seat of the whole trouble is that too
many appeals are granted where jus
tice does not demand it. . . .
Our courts trifle with justice by per
mitting delay after delay upon mere
technicalities.’ ”
The question of the “delay of the
law’’ being in large measure re
sponsible for many cases of mob vio
lence, can not be argued from any
point not already touched upon.
The two items quoted show how
widespread the habit of “pardoning”
and the granting of new trials has
become. •
The taxpayers of every State real
ize that the expenses of maintaining
the law is the heaviest one the State
has to shoulder.
The cost of the American jury sys
tem is enormous; the grounds on
which trials may be lengthened are
many; with the army of lawyers,
witnesses and court officials, the
money needed to sustain the system
totals a good part of the State’s reve
nue.
This expenditure should mean that
the criminal has been given every
opportunity to clear himself of the
crime charged.
The stories told of the means by
which some juries decide on a ver
dict make excellent “fillers” for
daily papers, but scarcely add peace
to the taxpayers mind when he real
izes his money is paying for it.
Georgia is gaining an unenviable
reputation as a State in which the
pardoning power is being over
worked.
Criminals whose trials have been
lengthy, therefore expensive, are
shown “clemency” which any one
who thinks must recognize as the
work of a shrewd lawyer who is as
sured of a fat fee.
If the oath which makes a man
eligible for jury duty is really bind
ing, and the verdict of the “twelve
good men” is founded absolutely on
the facts; if the presiding judge is
honest in his sentence, isn’t it hard
to realize on what grounds other
trials may be granted? Isn’t it mak
ing an absolute farce of the law
when we note that it is only the
criminal who can command money
for whom these grounds for new
trials may be discovered?
It’s true one or two, possibly half
a dozen, famous financiers are tak
ing rest cures in institutions found
ed and supported by the Govern
ment, but they are the “sacrificial
offerings demanded by an outraged
public.”
We need a revision of our judi
ciary, and we need it badly.
The courts are helpless so long as
the law recognizes the pleas of un
principled lawyers, who have no
pride in their profession and think
only of the monetary aspect.
Curb these shysters and we will
have less mob violence and fewer
lynchings.

the road feels it may make money by
the raise.

After reading of those three-year
