VIVIAN, LA., NOV. 4th, 1896.
Hon. II. L. Brian,
Natchitoches, La.
Dear Sir :--Tl'he election passed
off quietly yesterdav; there were
60 votes polled at Vivian, a very
good vote for this box. The vote
was as follows :
For Bryan 58, McKinley 2.
For Congress, B. W. Bailey 18,
H. W. Ogden 33, R. P. Hunter 1.
The two votes for McKinley were
through a mistake. I am proud to
say that the election was car
cried out according to law. I hope
all the boxes in the State were
carried out as well, for if there is
anything I do abhor, it is fraud in
the vote, I consider it the lowest
down principle that a man can be
guilty of, and the ballot box stuf
fers are responsible for the condi
tion that our government is in.
The fraud and rascality that were
practiced in our late election has
added several votes to the People's
party in this precinct.
Yours Respeetfully,
W. J. Mou.s,
The Electles.
McKinley is unquestionably
elected; exact figures are not yet
to be had, but he will have from
twenty-five to forty votes majority
in the electoral collegte. Many
Western states that were consider
ed eate for silver have gone for
him, sad the entire middle West.
Thiscannot be looked upon as a
repudiation of Free Silver. It is
not that, but it is the'unmistaka
ble evidence that the people have
no faith in the promises of the
democratic party, and even their
great faith in Mr. Bryn was not
strong enough for m to trust ,
the destinies of the nation for an
other four years to even him, back
ed only by the democrats, and their
promises to do better, if they were
given another chance. a
The democrats have virtually C
wrecked this country in the last
nr yes, and they have simply
been buried under the wreck. The
people have voted for the republi- I
can ticket in sheer' desperation. t
The indieations are that both sen
ate and house will be republican so
we will have an outright republi
m administration for the next -
oor years; there will be nothing
to idCerfre with their plans and
h peoe will watch them fear- a
 !abmost without hope.

A Christmas Trip.
f The thousands of Texans wl.o
caume from th" South Atlantic
States find muich pleasure in revert
ing to the happy days of Ion_ n~o
when they were children, and of
ten they awake at night to recall
Y those scenes of yore which gave
to life a charm, and which now
t come in later years as visions of
joy. There is a tender spot in
every heart for the old homl, and
the memories which cluster about
the dear old spot are solaces in the
weary. weary struggle we llmaike
day by day to build in our new
r Eldorado a home to which our
children in future time will turn,
as we turn now to the old place
where our loved ones in the even
ing of life await the final sumnllons.

You'11 Laugh
If You Read
t
This funny and instructive book
tells in a most humorous way how
the Angel of Liberty took Grover
Cleveland from the White House
in the dead of night, and left him,
ragged and hungry, in Oklahoma
City, to tramp home. Grover's
trial's and tribulations as a tramp
are most ludicrously related, and
his conversations with farmers
and laboring men about the silver
question are very instructive.
Everybody Should Read It.
It contains 174 pares of laugh
provoking matter, and 44) full-pare
illustrations of Cleveland as a
tramp.
