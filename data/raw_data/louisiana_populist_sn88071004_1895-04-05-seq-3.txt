People's Party Club.
The People's party Club of Ward Nine
had a splendid meeting at Bayou Natchez
Saturday afternoon. It was well attend
ed, and eleven new members were added
to the roll. Several Democrats were
preseat, and paid good attention to the
entire proceedings. We were glad to
have them, and hope they were pleasant
ly entertained.
Mr P. E. Prudhomme, the able repre
sentative of ward 9, on the police jury,
was preent, and assured the elab that
he would oppose raising the pariah taxes
for blidldg a Ortoueas, and that he
would never aouent to the pariah issua
aing bonds for such purpose, and gave it
as his opiniot that there was no necessi
ty of either oours for the building of
same. The club was well pleased with

The Courthouse.
Our police jury have acceded to
the popular demand against rais
ing the taxes, several members be
ing already opposed to it, and have
adopted plans to build a neat, sub-!
stantial, modern-styled Courthouse;
without raising taxation or issuing'
parish bonds.
There is now in the parish trea.s
ury a surplus sufficient to pay
about 1-fourth the price of the
structure, and this 'ears rcvnuetls
will produce a similar surplus, and
these two payments can he male,
one at and the other, shortly after
the completion of the building; the
remaining two payments can be
made in one and two years by econ
omy in other expenditures, which
the body has decided to make.
This is very gratifying, and our
police jury deserve credit for their
skillful management of this ques
tion.

sing merchants of Blayou Natchez, was

Seelalsltle.
It is unfortunate at this time
that some of our so-called leaders
(we have no leaders) are taking up
the plutocratic cry of Socialism.
Whether they are doing it for the
same purposes and objects as the
old party press, or whether they
have not sense enough to know
what Sociilism is, makee but little
difference, so far as the effect of
their silly cry is concerned. Every
living man who has a spark of hn"
man sympathy in his breast is so
cialistic, sad the Declaration of
Independence is almost radically
Kolalistic.
Our postofile system is socialis
tic.
Our public school system is not
only socialistic but paternalistic.
Sis supported by tax which is
used reade of amy equitable
distribution based upon the amount
whioh each must pay. The poor
man with a dosmen children and no
tar to pay is as much entitled to
the beats of the school as the
richb ia who pays a largs tax and
has but on or two childrea to send.
In msay States it is patrnalis
tio, bemmause donstions of land by
the Stats for shool P hs have
been made, thebs and the
proaeds ed in trust asafunmd,
the lntatest of which is apportion
