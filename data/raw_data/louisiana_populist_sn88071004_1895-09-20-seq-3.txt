Base Ball.
The harhecue given on the 15th
hby the SchemIers in honor of the
I-h riou ta Base Ball Club. was in
dee.Il a glorious success. At least
twit hundred and tifty persons were
present, and expressed themselves
V one 1and a:ll, well pleased. The
dlinnr was more than the crowd
coull eat, and plenty was left for
' distribution.
, In the afternoon the clubs gave
us a iimasterly exhibition of ball
playing. a1111 though defeated by a
score of --l13, the IBermuda nine
' fully sustained the confidence we I
had in them as 1players.
The condluct of both plavyers andt.
ti spectators denotes a new era in our
.:ball games, and is a decided ilm
pirovement upon the former games.
We are, not authorized to do so,
4r. but throw down the gauntlet to the
ift Kids, trusting to the Schemers to
- arrange a series with Ihem ere the
)er seascnm closes.
The public is under obligations
4r. to both clubs for good order and
tfine playing, and we assure our
itBermuda friends that they will
of never lack f r atn audience o:: our
diamiondl.
wr. e are in the Insurance business to
