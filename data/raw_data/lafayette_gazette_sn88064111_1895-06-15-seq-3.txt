A IRemarkable Cure of lhun.
S natism.
r Westminster, Cal., March 2z,
1894.-Some time ago, on awaken
ing one morning, I found that I
had rheumatism in my knee so bad
ly that, as I remarked to my wife,
it would be. impossible for me to
- attend to bussiness that day. Re
membering that I had some of
Chamberlain's Pain Balm in my
store I sent for a bottle, and rubbed
the afficted parts thoroughly with it,
according to directions, and within
an hour I was completely relieved.
Orte application had done the busi
ness. It is the best liniment on the
market, and I sell it under a posi
tive guarantee. R. T. HARRIS. e

A Doctor's trouble.
"My dear fellow," said my doctor to me,
e "you have no idea what we have to put up
a with. If I call to see a patient frequently,
I am trying to run up a bill;' if I don't 'it is
shameful neglect.' If I manage to get to
church, and am called out, I hear afterward,
' 'Working the Bob Sawyer dodge on Sunday,
Sch, Doctor?" If I am so busy that I cannot
Sgo, I am sure to be asked, 'How is that you
Sdoctors are all atheists?' If my wife calls
on people; 'it is because she is trying to get
patients for me,' but if she doesn't, it is be
I cause she is 'too stuck up.' If I cure a pa
t tient quickly-get credit, you say? Oh,
r dear no!-the patient 'wasn't half as bad as
the doctor tried to make out; why, he was
quite well in a week;' but, on the other
I hand, should the case develop serious com
t plication. 'Ah, the doctor never under
stood the malady; in fact, he was worse
when he had been taking the medicine a
week than when we called him in.' If I
f suggest a consultation, it is only because I
t don't know what is the matter; if I pooh
pooh the idea as unnecessary, I am 'afraid
of showing my ignorance.' I am expected
to-so to speak-cast a horoscope on a
baby's life, and tell its mother what its all
ments will be. If I can't do that I 'cannot
possibly know very much.' I am expected
to foresee all the 'ills that flesh is heir to'
six months before they come. I once lost a
e patient whom I had treated for influenza,
Sbecause I did not foretell an attack of rheu
matism which came on three months later.
In all cases, if they get worse, the fault lies
f in the medicine. If I send in my bill, they
say, 'He is in a terrible hurry for his money;
Sif I don't it is so unbusinesslike.' 'But we
Sget well pail' do you say? My dear sir, If
I received payment for one-half I do. I
should die from shock."-Medical Record.

The Entertainment.
The entertainment given at Falk's I
Opera House. last Friday by the t
Iadies of the V. C. T. U. was a
successful affair in every particular.
A number of persons among whormt
were Misses Emma Falk, Louise t
Bendel, 'Ada Moss and Messrs. t
Vand'erCruyssen, Voorhies, Camp- r
bell Pierre and Henry Gerac, and +
last, but not least, Master Harold
DeManade and Miss Viola Young, t
kindly volunteered their aid toward
entertainang the audience with vo
cal and instrumental music. Prof.
Will Webb read a very interesting
paper on the evils of intemperance
and the manifold dangers which lie I
in the liquor trafic. Refresh
ments were served to those present c
by the ladies in charge of the ta- F
bles.
This entertainment was given to {
promote the cause of temperance in
our community and it is safe to say -
that a few more such gatherings will
swell the ranks of the W. C. T. U,
thereby strengthening the societyand
increase its power for good which
has already been felt to an appre
ciablI extent.
Must Tell Them Out.
Miss Frances E. Willard says:
The fact that Lady Henry Somerset
has by her example and honest, a
hard work put total abstinence and t
the local veto bill on a higher plane i
than they have ever heretofore oc
cupied, alarms the liquor traffic,
and as soon as her back is turned
to leave, America, the enemies of
temperance have rehashed the old
falsehoods about her as a land
owner. In reply let it be once
more stated that her estates are en
tailed; she has only a life-use of
her property, no right to sell it, but
whenever any lease expires she
drives out liquor selling and its at
tendant abominations. The Lon
don County Council will testify that
no landlord has met their efforts to
ameliorate the conditions of the
slum so promptly and cordially as
Lady Henry Somerest. She is op
posed to the House of Lords and
his not hesitated to let it be known.
She is disliked by the aristocatic
classes who look upon her as a re
creant, and yet she goes bravely
and gently on her way, doing good
and not evil all the days of her life.
We know all these things to be true
and we must 'tell them out' to the
gret world."
Alcohol is covering the land with
misery, i.dleness and crime.
The New York Germain liquor
dealers want a '"two-hour opening"
on Sundays. That would be the
entrance of a wedge.
There is serious talk in Washing
ton of helping out the revenue by
increasing the tax on beer dollar a
barrel. That would yield $30,
000,000.
Tonic bitters and nerve cures
have often brought on the drinking
habit. It is not safe to take any
thing of the sort unless you are sure
there's no alcohol in them.
Dr. H. A. Irion, dental surgeon,
has opened an office in the post
office building. Dr. Irion is a son
of Judge Irion of Avoyelles and
comes to us highly recommended.
Mr. Fred Mouton has started to
work on the store building being
erected on Lincoln avenue for
Messrs. Mouton Bros.
Man places himself higher than

,Trilby Marceh."
Our townsnman, Mr. H. Vander
Cruyssen, has just finished the com
position of a very pretty piece of
music which will make its advent in
the world of music under the name,
"Trilby March." Mr. Vander
Cruyssen is an up-to-date composer
and he could not afford to let the
"Trilby Craze" subside without
prolonging its life with one of his
original compositions.
