The Greatest Medical Discovery
of the Age.
KENNEDY'S
MEDICAL DISCOVERY,
0ONALD KENNEDY, OF ROXBURY, MASS.,
Has discovered in one of our common
pasture weeds a remedy that cures every
kind of Humor, from the worst Scrofula
down to a common imple.
He has tried it in over eleven hundred
cases, and never failed except in two cases
(both thunder humor). He has now in his
possession over two hundred certificates
of its value, all within twenty miles of
Boston.
A benefit is always experienced from
the first bottle, and a perfect cure is war
ranted when the right quantity is taken.
When the lungs are affected it causes
shooting pains, like needles passing
"through them; the same with the Liver or
Bowels. This is caused by the ducts being
stopped, and always disappears in a week
after taking it.
If the stomach is foul or bilious it will
cause squeamish feelings at first.
No change of diet ever necessary. Eat
the best you can get, and enough of it.
Dose, one tablespoonful in water at bed
time, and read the Label.

There have beens some great days at
Jackson park since the fair opened, but
the greatest day in all probability that
the White City will see will be Am-eri
can day, July 4 next. A few days ago
Germany had her day, and it was
grandly and enjoyably celebrated by
the Germans of the city. There were
nearly a quarter of a million people in
the grounds on that occasion. and Ger
mania was the recipient of distinguished
honors, but on the Fourth of July
we expect to see a celebration which
will outshine anything of the kind ever
held in this country. Centennial day
not excepted.
This is, of course, as it should be,
for while we are a cosmopolitan people
and nation the American sentiment
should prevail and all American-born
citizens should take pride in an event
which will herald to the world the
magnitude of our institutions and the
progress of our country. There will
no doubt be a greatly increased at
tendance during the first week of July.
in view of the grand sights programmed
for the Fourth. The excursions have
begun to come in and the floating pop
ulation of our great city is daily in
creasing. In reference to the coming
celebration one of our leading dailies
contains this glowing outburst:
"'Fourth of July at the fair will be a
roarer. All the contrivances known to
pyrotechnic art, all the eloquence of a

hund red orators, all the music of a hu n
dred bands, all the huzzas and hurraha
of a million lungs will be united in a
patriotic din such as the world has
never heard. It will begin at sunrise
and last the day out, and all the fiery
glory of Bunker Hill and Concord and
Lexington will be magnified a hundred
fold as a national demonstration of the
fact that American liberty is as sure
and safe as the granite ribsof its moun
tains. The declaration of independence
will be read in twenty tongues from
galleries and parapets and platforms,
while all the tribes, from slaving Turks
to barbarous Dahomans, unite in cheers
for the success and everlastingness of
the giant republic.
"The exposition people now have all
Shoulders at the wheel, and with the
brilliance of the dedication to eclipse
they have planned along leviathar
lines. The greatest day in American
history deserves the greatest celebration
that money and brains can devise at the
hands of the greatest enterprise the
=ountry ever witnessed. All the men
who make such occasions a business
have been called into council that the
visiting nations may understand how
numerously and noisily loyal this free
people is. From dawn until the next
daylight there will be such a bewilder
ing confusion of booming and such a
blinding display of fire and such a deaf
ening roar of patriotic airs that the
--whole world will be convinced that this

whole people is as loyal to the old dec
laration as were the embattled farmers
who fought for it."
The programme for the day has been
outlined and it is replete with interest
ing itatures from beginning to end.
The evening will. be made grandly
gorgeous by all the arts of which pyro
technical genius is master, the figures
to be presented being those of most
prominence in the history of our inde
pendence as a nation.
The people of the various states hav
ing representative buildings at the fair
have been having great times within
the past few days. Indiana, California
and Texas have just completed their ex
hibits and have done the opening
honors in magnificent style. Morenota
ble than the others is probably the Cal
ifornia building, on account of the
magnitude of its dimensions and the
variety and volume of its contents.
Built on the lines of the old Spanish
missions of the Pacific coast it is ex
esedingly picturesque, and filled as it is
.with-the wonderful productions of the
"oklden State" it affords the visitor a
orItrtof pleasure in the. cntemplation
of iti besuties.
There awe but few of the state bildM
in,',4aow a . la.he, aid those stat
" b, lida. have e
;Thae state; hoa er, is very crei tably
repseqmeted in the various departmnt
buildings o the exposition.
Juast at qresent the weather is very
warn and we are having a foretaste of
what we may expeqt during the heat of
the midsummer days. Several cases of
prostration have resulted from injudi
cious exposure on the part of too eager
-sighteeers, and the patrol wagons of the
police department have been called
into requisition to convey the victims
of inordisate curiosity to the hospital.
With one thing and another the
police of the fair have been kept pretty
busy since the opening day, although
the number of crimes committed in the
grounds has been surprisingly small.
Once in awhile some luckless individual
meets with a loss cr an accident and im
mediately resorts to the patrol, which
attends to his case with promptness
and dispatch. Since the cessation of
building operations there have been but
few accidents to workmen, the only
death reported for a long time occur
ring a few days ago.
This was a very distressing case. One
of a number of men who were working
near the roof of the Manufactures
building lost his hold and fell one hun
dred and seventy feet to the floor be
low. A great many visitors were in the
building at the time, and they beheld a
sight which unnerved the strongest of
them and caused a number of women
to faint. The poor man was dashed
nto a shapeless mass ,nd never re
gained consciousness.
The hospital service at the fair is ex
cellent in every respect and through
its agency many broken limbs have
been restored and much suffering has
been alleviated. The provisions for
caring for the children is another fea
ture of the fair service that is especial
ly commendable. lly its aid tired
mothers are relieved of their precious
burdens for the time and enabled to go
about unhampered by their little ones,
whom in many instances they must
take with them or remain at home
themselves
The complaints of extortion which
were so frequent a short time ago are
now no longer heard, or at least are be
coming very rare, and the impression,
which had been somewhat general, that
people were being robbed at the fair is
gradually becoming effaced. There are
plenty of free water and toilet accom
modations, and lunches may be had at
a moderate charge. This being the
case, a person of modest means need
not go hungry, thirsty or dirty while
visiting the fair.
TICKETS FOR ALL PEOPLE.
Eighteen Varieties In Use by Visitors at
the Exposition.
Eighteen different kinds of tickets
are now in use for admission to the
fair. The eighteenth is the Handel, or
music ticket, which will be used only
by those taking part in the choruses
and concerts at the exposition.
The Handel ticket is one of the pret
tiest of the lot. It is of the same size
as the souvenir ticket. It is printed in
black ink on the face and light blue on
the reverse side. The face contains a
picture of Handel playing a harp. The
ticket bears the signatures of P'resident
Higinbotham and Treasurer Seeberger.
The other seventeen tickets that are
in use are as follows: Complimentary
cards, for dignitaries; photograph
passes, monthly and season; trip pass,
issued only by Presidents Palmer and
Higinbotham and Director General
Davis; daily ticket, for adults and chil
dren; souvenir tickets, four kinds; Ben
Franklin press ticket; workmen's daily
ticket, two colors, blue for Sixty-second
street entrance and pink for Midway,
and workmen's fifteen-day ticket, four
colors.
In addition to these there are three
kinds of badges which will admit-one
worn by the commissioners, one by the
directors and one by the department
chiefs.

AMoxo the English exhibits in the

are of steel. There is a model of the
Black Warrior, the first ironclad built

In a neighboring tube is a yellow white
film almost transparent. It is "Bacillus
Diphtheria Colomb" - bottled death

third tube shows a yellowish brown
spot the size of an ordinary button.
"Bacillus of the American Pork Dis

HOW TO PREVENT SUNSTROKE.
World's Fair Physicians Olve Out Valuable
Hints for Visitors.
Drs. J. L. Iillmantel and WV. H. Al
port, of the medical staff of the world's
fair, were asked'about the liability of
exposition visitors to sunstroke, what
they should do to prevent insolation
and all its phases, and what treatment
should be immediately resorted to by
friends or any bystander possessed of
ordinary presence of mind. Dr. Hill
mantel said:
"To begin at the beginning, visitors
should bathe before coming to the fair.
They will be so refreshed by the bath
that they will be well prepared for a
day's sight-seeing. They should eat
before leaving home, prudently, of
course, and while on the groundsshould
eat. They should not wander around
all day on one meal, as exhaustion is
altogether likely to attend such long
fasting.
"Coming to the fair men and women
should wear light clothing or clothing
suitable to the weather, and on a warm,
oppressive day they should pay atten
tion to their footwear, wearing light
and easy shoes. Headgear should be
looked after. Women are better off in
this respect, and the men should wear
light hats, and when in the shade
should remove them frequently.
"But above all, visitors should be
careful about what they drink. The
water used is of the utmost importance,
and none but pure water should be
used. Moderate drinking should be in
dulged, even when water is used, and if
ice cream soda or other cold drinks are
taken, they should be indulged in mod
erately, drank slowly, very deliberate
ly, and the party had better seat him
self while drinking."
"No one,"' interposed Dr. Alport,
"ought to undertake the task of doing
the fair in one day. It can't be done,
and the effort is sure to result in
juriously, even if the person is not
stricken or prostrated while on the
grounds."
Dr. lillmantel, continuing, said: "I
recommend WVooded island as a grateful
retreat while the sun is hottest, and all
visitors should keep in the shade as
much as possible, get into the build
ings; and when out on the avenues
every man and woman should be pro
vided with a sunshade."
"Avoid rushing or running, eat
well, but moderately, drink moder
ately, and keep out of the sun's
direct heat as much as possible,"
said both the doctors, "and visitors will
find such precautions sure to enable
them to make the tour of the fair com
fortably and without danger."
"Women especially," said Dr. Hill
mantel, "weight themselves down with
bundles and wraps. They should avoid
this and come to the grounds in light
marching order."
A FPine Plece of Work.
Among the many beautiful exhibits
of embroidery in the Woman's building
there is nothing more interesting than
a handkerchief made for Mary Antoi
nette. It is on the finest of lawn and
the embroidery was done with the aid
of a microscope, two of the workwomen
losing their sight while working upon
it. The design is of the chase, hunts,
men, hounds and game being bronght
out with wonderfual regard to detail
