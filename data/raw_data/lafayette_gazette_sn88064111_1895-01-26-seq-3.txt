the building with all its contents
were soon consumed. Over 2oo

diary.

A Stranger Run Over.
Henry Marten, a stranger about
2o years of age, was run over by a
freight train at Duson Wednesday
evening, sustaining injuries from
which he died a few hours later. It
appears that Marten fell under the
wheels of the cars in the attempt to
steala ride. He was terribly man
gled, his legs and one arm being
nearly severed from his body. The
railroad men say that Marten tried
to accomplish the dangerous feat of
jumping on the rods while the train
was running. As the train was go
ing west Marten was taken to Rayne
where he was kept a few hours after
which he was brought to Lafayette
by the east-bound local freight train
for the purpose of securing the med
ical assistance of Dr. Tdlson, the

fortunate man was . dead. Dr.

the body and had it decently buried.

their future h~oi in Lafayette.

of their trusted agents.

zia Landry were married at thz
Catholic church in this town Tues

the church was witnessed by a large
number of friends and relatives, who
accompanied the newly made cou

A Guod Record.
While in New Iberia last Sunday
a Gazette reporter heard some very
flattering comments on the good
-work Judge Voorhies is doing in
that district. -Ie has just closed a
very fruitful term of court, having
rendered fifty decisions during thet
term which lasted seven week,.
Judge Voorhies is' a "worker" and
has made a record of which any
public servant might be proud.
A Run-a-way
The horses hitched to the wagon
carrying the mail and express be
tween this place and Breaux Bridge
ran away near the depot Wednesday
evening and started down the road
at a terrific speed. The empty
egg-boxes with which the wagon
was loaded were scattered in differ
ent directions and the wagon was
knocked into smithereens. The
driver, an old negro, was thrown to
the ground but received no injuries.
2179 Birds.
A large shipment of game was
made by Alcide Judice at Scott last
week. It was assigned to New
Orleans and consisted of 1549 rob
bins, 15o rabbits, 200o snipes, 18o
quails, 91 doves and 9 wild dclucks.
This we believe is the largest ship
ment of game made from this parish

The Baby Show.
The Woman's Chlristan Temper
ance Union will give a baby show
at their hall on second street, on
T'ue;sday, F'eb. 12, fronm 3 to 6 and
from 6 to io p. m. the ages of ba
bies ranging from 6 months to 3
years old. Entrance fee for each
child will be zo cents.
T'he babies are required to be
dtessed in plain white Mother Hub
bards, without ornaments.
Mothers far and near are invited
to enter their babies in the contest.
There will be a musical and literary
entertainnilent, during which the
judges will award three prizes. The
prizes will be on exhibition at the
principal stores in town.
I.ight refreshments will be served.
General admission zo cents.
The above item taken from the
Morgan City Voice suggests to us
the propriety of giving a like enter
tainment in Lafayette. We have
in this town the material to make
the finest display of babies in the
world. No one who has seen any
number of Lafayette's pretty babies
will gainsay this statement--if he
does he'll be the most unpopular
man in town. WV¢ believe that
there are a few dollars short to pay
for the school anne,. WVhy not give

the indications are that rice will be
planted more extensively this year
than usual.
Mrs. Thompson Hoffpauir and
son who have been quite sick for

the Times-Democrat of Jan. 22
says: "The Pleasant View planta
tion, near this place, was the scene
of an outrage, prepetrated upon two
negroes by whipping them severely
and threatening others with the
same fate. The plantation is owned
and operated by Dr. F. R. Martin,

named, iviih important State wit
nesses, were placed in jail in St.
Martinsville to awaite the action of
the grand jury, which is in session
now at that place."
Parish Convicts.
Several parishes have passed or
dinances governing the working

for minor offenses to the parish
prison, as authorized under act 29
of 1894. The police jury of East
Carroll parish has adopted the fol
lowirig schedule:

The Topic Of The Hour.
Vithin the past year, and es
lpecially within the last six months,
fi flln, e- hlis tLkcn, aA· a ,opic cf
press discussion, the place occupied
for several years past by the tariff.
Contradictory and irreconcilable as
are the positions, complex and con
fused as are the arguments, of thi
political parties and leaders of the
country upon the tariff question,
they are no less so upon the ques
tion of finance. The geit politi
cal problem of the day in the
United States is the problem of re
forming the National currency.
The man or woman who pretends to.
be well inforimed will not be con
tent to learn the views of a few
newspapers only upon the financial
and other questions of the hour,
but will seek in some way to get a
survey of the press discussion in
all parts of the country and upon
all sides of the question at issue.
There is no way to get such a sur
vey except by reading a journal
that gives extracts and condensed
statements front iall the leading rep
resentative papers and reviews.
Such a journal is Pism.rc OPrNxoN.
published weekly at Washington, D.
C. In its particular field it is
unique and unrivaled. It covers
the entire range of current news and
comment, political, sociological,
financial, scientific, religious, liter
ary, both American and foreign.
In connection- with the Atiericin
Institute of Civics it has inaug
urated an exceedingly helpful Mlan
for the study of current topics. (A
pamphlet containing details for the
organization and conduct of clubs
and valuable suggestions as to
methods of work Will be sent for
