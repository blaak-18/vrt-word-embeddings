"Itis now generally believled that
Weston's extraordinary feat is the
result of a long cherished determina.

gentlemen of sporting proclivitiee to
a Mercury representative. "Io a

best laid and carried out plans to
scoop a big winning that was ever
concocted. I dare not give you
names; but I will tell you a story,
for the truth of which ie its minutest
details I pledge you my honor.
"A friend of mine, a club man and
a passionate sportsman, was a heavy

the international match at Gilmare's

general publie.
"My friend went to England on
business inmmediately after the match.
He there met Weston, whom he had
known bef~re. Weston expressed
himself warml y a regard to Amer.

"Westos's popularity as a walker

"Weston did so. No soul outside

Whitewash for Outside Work.
First, whitewash, it is well known,
passes to a carbonate of lime ina few
days by absorbing carbonic acid from
the air, and, being soluble to a ser.
taco extent in water, is soon washed
oft when ezposed to the rains. To
prevent this a wash prepared as fol
lows lasts much longer: To ha blf a
bushel of good lime add enough wa.
ter to slake and be about the co1sis
tence of a thick sirap, and, while
hot, add half a gallon of linseed oil
and stir well. To this misztris add
half a pound of common glue, dis,
dolved in a gallon of boiling water.
After letting it stand a few hours,
thin it with water to the proper con.
sistence for applying, and it is ready
for use. Some parties recommended
the addition of salt and others saol
phato of sine, bue I amoot see any
plausible theory, to satisfy me that
there is say adintage in their ua.
With the liased oil pun lnsolutol asp
is formed (alate of lime), and the
glue forms.n insoluble cement which
protects the lime from the dissolving
oasese of. the water. It is possible
that tallow will answer the seae per.
pose, as the rmelting composed
would be the sam.-oleate of lime
the glycerine of the fat belog set
tree. Second-To every four quarts
of slakened lime add one-half pint of
boiled glne, a laump of alum about
twice the size of a hickory nut and
one table spoonful of salt, with joust
s~clent bluing to give a pare white
tier. Third--Slake lime in the usual
way; mix a handful of flour with
old water, taking care nt to have
lamsa; ties poer ea boiling water
ntil t beesqes like ee mans stabl
