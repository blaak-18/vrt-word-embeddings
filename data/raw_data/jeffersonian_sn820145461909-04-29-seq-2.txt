PAGE TWO
At the age of two my attention was
first directed toward Bill. He had
just arrived and was putting up a
loud holler for lunch. For one so
young, Bill had a fine tenor voice,
and the use of it appeared to afford
him unusual pleasure —more pleasure
than we had, in fact.
Bill exhibited a marked dislike for
me from the beginning. I presume
this was because I was by long odds
the best looking. As I remember
Bill at that period, he had a nose
about the size and complexion of a
canned, and it was suspended midway
betwixt a pair of eyes that reminded
me of spoiled grapes. I do not re
call noticing Bill’s mouth when
closed —except once. On that occa
sion I had been induced by a bribe to
insert my finger in Bill’s face for
the purpose of feeling his new fangs.
Bill recognized me during the opera
tion and shut down for keeps, retain
ing me in a fond embrace until dad
got a screw-driver and made him
loosen up his features. I never had
as much faith in Bill after that. I
imagine he has never placed full
trust in me since also, because I
have never been 'able to borrow a
dollar from him.
Bill grew fast —like a hound-pup.
His appetite worked from seven in
the morning till the same time next
day. As a consequence, he grew big
and beefy, and acquired a head like
a Hubbard squash. When he was
three years of age he made the har
rowing discovery that I was a
miser. I had hoarded up the stupen
dous sum of a dollar and thirty-seven
cents in cold coin. Bill broke that
bank, and dissipated its contents
'among his youthful friends. I made
an attempt to impress upon Bill the
enormity of his crime, but he grew
denser the longer I argued, and the
thing ended in the woodshed, with
dad enacting the role of the villain,
Legree.
Time flew on and it became Bill’s
turn to visit the woodshed where, in
the past, I had shed so many bitter
tears to the tune of the rollicking
shingle or the lath. It is a bright
spot in my memory. I love to dwell
upon it. Bill had heaved a marble at
the clock, and the marble had knocked
time out of the latter. With an in
stinctive motion dad gathered me in,
but my vehement protests finally con
vinced him that for once he was in
error. Reluctantly he released me
and formed an attachment to Bill.
1 followed. Being a casual specta
tor of a scene of that sort was new
to me and I expected to enjoy it. It
was great —until dad got through
with Bill. Then the fun ran right
out of it, for dad saw me gloating
and ho took me in. I received what
was left over from Bill. It was
quite a lot, too. But it fitted me
very well.
When Bill was five I passed sen
tence of death upon him. He had
sent me a peculiarly cutting valen
tine, and my sensitive nature would
not be satisfied with aught but blood.
I met Bill in the yard, and told him
that I was going to make match

than it would take a dog to choke on
•a sandwich. He said he was glad to
hear it, as he had been aching to
hand me a package for some time, on
his own account. We mixed. When
we separated, Bill had delivered his
package, and I realized that I had
placed the date of my vengeance too
late in the calendar.
Perceiving that Bill intended to be
a permanent fixture in the family, I
saw that discretion was the better
part of safety, and so formed a union
with him in the discovery and manu
facture of our celebrated pain-proof
pads. In our household, these arti
cles were a daily necessity, and Bill
and I would hook on our pads by
instinct whenever we sighted dad
coming home from work.
As Bill grew up he manifested a
strong leaning toward sport. Elderly
ladies, who infested our vicinity,
made no bones of predicting violent
deaths for both of us, although the
writer was one of the best boys you
ever saw. Couldn’t think of any
thing wicked without getting sick at
the stomach. Bill, on the other hand,
was a hardened wretch, and was never
happier than when facing dearth in
some form or other. He once fell off
a forty-foot windmill without sus
taining a bruise. It is only fair to
state that he fell into a tankful of
soft water. If it had been hard it
would have killed him.
School was a grisly specter that
darkened Ball’s early life. He re
garded it as an evil that was to be
avoided whenever possible, and he
made it possible about four days per
week. Bill got far enough advanced
so that he knew that one cat and an
ather cat made one cat-fight. Then
the school board got their hooks into
him, and dragged him through two or
three rooms by main strength. When
he tackled mathematics Bill got
thrown hard. Physiology made him
step sideways like a blind
horse smelling an automobile dead
ahead. Ancient history gave him the
nightmare so bad that I refused to
speak to him. When Bill peeked
into an algebra one day his digestion
gave completely out, and he accepted
a job at the brickyard, passing hot
bricks to a wheelbarrow.
Bill stuck to the brickyard until
he had a complexion like an orang
outang. Then he staked himself out
on a farm. Here he did fine —in
three years cleaning up almost
twenty-seven dollars in egotiable
cash and securities.
He then resigned from the farm
and came home —to hunt. His rural
existence had presented him with
large, jagged features and fingers
like bananas. His face was tanned
the color of an Italian’s work-shirt.
He had a voice like a bear in a churn.
When he laughed, the lamps flickered,
the loose change in dad’s pocket rat
tled, and the cows came home. He
was as full of fun as a soda fountain
is of fizz—and at the same pressure.
I remember distinctly the time
when Bill blew me for a dog. I was
not suffering for a dog at all, but
when Bill had gone to the trouble of
contracting for the animal, I paid for

it without any useless murmurs. I
had a reputation then, and I guarded
it earnestly. If I had owned a pro
phetic eye I would have counter
manded that pup at the start. It
was ray first great error. The trou
ble that brute caused in, around, and
among our family would have made
a Mormon mend his ways.
Bulger, the dog, took a particular
dislike to dad, and would make a
strenuous attempt to tree him on his
return from work. This was hard to
do, as dad was built like a Saratoga
trunk and hated climbing, and, in
addition to that, he was remarkably
hard to persuade. By the time dad
had kicked Bulger onto the roof of
the summer kitchen half a dozen
times, the animal saw a great light
and yielded to superior force.
Bulger led a checkered career. He
ended it by giving way to temptation.
Mother had set out a line of lemon
pies to cool. They had lather on
them two and a half inches thick, and
were things of beauty and a joy for
ever. I have seen dad begin at one
edge of one of mother’s lemon pies
and never draw a breath till he
emerged smiling and triumphant at
the farther edge. He could almost
inhale one of those pies. A fellow
had to open his jaws till his back hurt
to bite one of those pies, but when
he did, it was worth the misery.
The pies had hardly got acclimated
on the back porch when our canine
pet sighted them. He jammed his
cold, clammy muzzle into pie number
one, in an endeavor to learn more of
its character and habits. As he
drew back to think it over, the froth
stuck to his nose, and, in some sur
prise, Bulger ran out a foot or so of
tongue to remove it. As we had not
taught him to spit he had to taste it.
Tears of joy came into the dog’s
deep hazel eyes as he did so. He
yearned for more till his hind legs
fairly trembled. It was a terrible mo
ment —and Bulger yielded. He scalped
those pies with the neatness and dis
patch of a Sioux Indian, and went
out back of the barn to take a siesta.
After a while he woke up and re
membered the pies. He started back,
hoping mother had planted a fresh
row for his benefit. She was just
coming out to interview those pies as
he came up. iShe saw him coming—
with foam on his chops, and as far
back as his ears. The sight nearly
seared mother to death, but a hasty
glance at the pies reassured her. She
picked up a tomato can full of fish
worms belonging to Bill, and, with
cruel aim, heaved it at poor Bulger.
It missed Bulger by a narrow margin
of about a rod, and broke two dol
lars’ worth of glass in the hothouse.
Bulger shot under the back porch
like a shot from a thirteen-inch gun.
When dad reached home he viewed
the pies, and forthwith sentenced the
animal to death for life. As Bill re
fused to curtail the dog’s happy life,
and as dad was too tired to lead the
brute outside of the corporate limits,
this sad duty devolved on a neigh
bor’s son.
Sam Berry took the dog in one
hand and a big, round dollar in the
other. His instructions were terse
and significant. He was to come
back with no dog. Sam was back
in an hour with a marrow-freezing
tale of slaughter. He went into de
tails with such vividness and skill
that it nearly broke our hearts.
Mother wept, dad sneezed, and Bill
wore a face as long as a horse. Sam
finally left us alone with our grief—a
mighty fortunate thing for him. He
had hardly been gone a minute when
the rapid patter of doggish feet was
heard, and Bulger came up the front
walk like a delayed sky-rocket and
jumped through the open door right
into dad’s lap. The shock pushed
dad over and broke the back off the
chair he was assuaging his grief on.
Bulger then leaped across the table
and gave mother a hasty facial mas
sage, yelped a few times in glee, and
pounced upon Bill. He was the hap
piest dog I have ever seen —before or
since. Even dad looked pleased—
though he gritted his teeth every
time he thought of those lemon pies.
In those early days Bill’s clothes
were hereditary. Mine were, too, but
I will not admit it. When dad finally
made up his mind that he had ac
tually worn his clothes as long as
his contempt for them would per
mit, they descended by easy stages
to Bill and me. The process of re
vision Was a fearful and wonderful
one. The clothes were turned inside
out, and as clothes of thah period
wore a shaggy inner surface, Bill and
I used to be garbed like mountain
goats. Some of the pants we in
habited had hair on, an inch in
length. A fellow once touched a
match to the fuzz on Bill’s breeches,
and it took ten of us to put Bill out.
the affair he possessed a burnt
hair odor that made his society very
exclusive.
These trousers were always made
on a large scale. Two could get into
them with ease and comfort. It was not
until Bill began bringing home contra
band pickerel under cover of his
huge pants that mother saw the error
of her way. If Bill had lugged in a
fish across his houlders, the warden,
who lived next door as a precaution,
would have nabbed him. But by slit
ting the pickerel’s tail and buttoning
it over his suspender button, he
could tote in twenty pounds of fish,
provided the pants remained on.
Mother changed the situation -by
cutting a big V-shaped gash in the
upper rim of Bill’s trousers and
sewing the gash together. This puc
kered Bill up so that he could wear
his pants without using suspenders,
and he grew quite proud over it.
Bill had a blood-curdling adven
ture with those hirsute pants once.
He had a girl—also an ice-boat. In
constructing the latter, Bill had stolen
the sheets from the spare bed to use
as a sail. This crime was not dis
covered until mother accused the
presiding elder of the theft, and Bill
manfully opened his heart and con
fessed.
Bill invited the girl tn go ice-yot
ting—some spell it yacht, but I can’t.
She was tickled to death to go,, and
