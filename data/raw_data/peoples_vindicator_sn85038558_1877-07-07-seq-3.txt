Court adjourned on Friday last
after a weary and tedious session of
four weeks. A great deal of business
was transacted, a synopsis of which
we will publish next week.
The School Board will now take
lhoh of Public Schools and organize
them thoroughly.
Capt. Dick Sinnott's New Part Able,
was at our port, Gran·d lcore, on
Tuesday, as usual. We thank Capt.
George Hamilton tor kindly rcmenm

Mr. Forbis, from Sabine, favors us

issue to a late hour on Saturday.
The glorious FrocuTr was observed
more generally this, than any year
since the war. Business was sus
peaded and Picnic's were indulged
in by nearly every one.
A careful perm;al of the Minutes of
the Police Jury will repay our citi
seas. There are many good ordinan,

Parties having claims that have been
approved by the Police Jury will call
upon the Clerk for a voucher tor
them.
Mr. Jackson Rains reports the con
lition of crops in his sectiom as most
excellent. In fact, he says, they were
never so good as now.
Mr. Chas. Castex places on our ta
ble some bunches of grapes which he
has improved fr' the wild woods
rape by simple trinmning and att en
on. It is wonderful indeed to see
gnat difference between the wild
grape natural and the wild gr;ape cul
tivated. Mr. Castex's vineyard will
be in fine order. within two years and
be will be enabled to supply wine to
his section.
Mr. Charles Payne's potatoe 3icld
Seems to attract some attention. Our
satirate last week was an error- -the
yield of potatoes on a piece of ground
lO4105 feet was 86 bushels, a possible
yield to the acre of 88 bushels. The
ground and potatoes are still on hand

Your rEsolutins. also authorized st to

have male aI very earful exatmination
into the Treasurer's hooks, hut were not
ill any wise nlightienedt on the ui.tjet of
the Financial caolition of the parish, in
consequence of thl ,ootks having beel
very improperly kem t-in fact we may
say that no books were kept by him. lh,
sides, we consider it a work of superero
gation, and quite useless to report auty
errors oir irregularities in said Tlreasurer's
accounts, sliuld any exist, as your lion.
Body had, previous to appointing the
undersigned to examine his accounts,
passed ta ordinance authorizing the Re
corder to cqueel Mr. Breda's Bond.
Mr. XWillis HIohies, late Treasurer. has
made ont aind suhmitted for our tolsider.
ation and examinatin on, his final state
ment and account, which is a companied
herewith, and which has h, on examinted
by Treasurer Lemee, and found correct.
We would recommend that said account
be spread upon the Minutes of your pro
ceedings for puilication, and that the
two Warrants therein mentioned for $50
each. representing one hundred dollars
paid to Messrs. Jack & Pierson, be dles
troyedl by being burned, the same having
been this day cancelled by the Treasurer
in his books. We would also recommend
the cancellation for Mr. Holmes' Bond.
We would fuirther recoiniend that
your Hon. Body pass an ordinance re
quiring the par sh Assessor to make out
two Assessment Rolls for the parish, one
ror the use of the Collector and one for
the use of the Parish Treasurer, also re
quiring the Tax Col ector hereafter to
make out two Delinquent Listsone for
the use of the Treasurer. and one for the
use of his successor. By this means the
Treasurer would be greatly facilitated in
entering his accounits with the Collector,
anrd thereby obviate the trouble of said
Treasurer in examining the Rolls and
Lists in the Collectors ofice, tbr one
woul be a check against thle other; the
financial affairs of the parish would then
be kept in a business-like way, and the
hooks opened at all times to the inspec
tion of all ctieerneti.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
