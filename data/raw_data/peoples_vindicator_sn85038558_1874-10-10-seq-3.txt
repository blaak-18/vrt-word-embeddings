The Situation, is
A special to the Times this morn- pi
ing from New Orleans indicates a de- fa
plorable and disgraceful condition of a
affairs in that city. It seems a move- -
ment is on foot there headed by Lieu- ni
tenant Governor Penn and a number i
of prominent mulattoes and negroes, di
to adopt the Terrebonne compromise ; ti
while the Bonrbon democrats have a
ignored the Baton Rouge fusion and
propose to hold a democratic con- is
vention to-morrow to make city and ai
parish tominations. The spirit that to
has wronght this disruption and ,
threatens the cause of Louisiana with tl
ruin, is plainly discernable ,it is the tl
same spirit that brought discord into d
our ranks in 1872, ansd finally sold the
State to Kellogg to secure the offices a
in New Orleans to a clique or ring of c,
individuals who claim to possess all f
the democracy. patriotism and poli. o
tical wisdom of this State, and who tl
are rapidly bringing themselves into I
dleserved odium and Louisiana into o
undeserved contempt. ii
The coup d'etat in New Orleans was ii
the most brilliant event in the history t
of reconstruction and has attracted
the attention, admiration and sym
pathy of the whole country; but in o
the very midst of the applause that
birilliant movement won, and while P
the blood of its martyrs still reddens
the pavements of the streetse the po- .
litical leaders-Great God, what lead- a
ers for a brave people -as if actors P
in a pantomine, have dropped from tl
the sublime to the ridiculous, and are b
now playing parts so low and dis- a
graceful as to provoke the laugher o
and contempt of the spectators. a
At the Baton Rouge Convention, a
the delegates of the people of New ti
Orleans met the representatives "of i
the people of the parishes, and there I
a campaign was solemnly agreed upon. p
How the people of North Louisiana a
have fulfilled their duty; how truly, n
bravely, unflinchingly they have c
stood by the common cause; how c
nobly in parish and town they have d
shown that the common good, and not a
private aspirations, was their aim in
this struggle, are matters of record. 1
We have permitted no miserable and
contemptible personal aspirations for
office to breed discord in our conven- n
tions; we have selected our best men
and put them in the field; day and 8
night we have labored--not fdr Cad- 1
do, nor for DeSoto, nor for Bossier, I
nor for Webster, nor for any other J
parish-but for Louisiana; we have 9
been true to Baton Rouge and follow- t
ed the white baser displayed there
with unfaltering steps, and made up
in its support a record that has direct- 1
ed all the vengeance of the foes of the
State against us. When the intelli
gence came to us of the granid move
ment in New Orleans, we were in
.stantl.y in arms, ready to sustain it to c
any extremity New Orleans might be e
bold enough to carry it; at night, the i
'telegraph announced the opening of t
the conflict at the capitol city, and r
the morning sun shown upon a people
from the banks of the Onachita to r
the borders of Texas, is arms and
prepared to take the field. The over
throw by the Federal power of the
'legal government of the State and the l
nsumission of New Orleans inspired t
North Louisiana with no dismay. e
After the overthrow of the revolution, P
our battle line was reformed and the
cnampign reopened on the Baton
Rnouge plan; and we had every rea.
son to expect that the people through- t
out the State would be true to the t
cause in which all had engaged. But C
at this critieal momeot, and but a
:few weeks in which to work, while
tihe republicans are massing their
colnmns and threatening every see
tion of the 8tateiS the news eomes to
us that in New Orleans, Lieutenant'
Governor Penn and his followers are
organizing a new movement, and that
the democrats have ignored the "Ba
ton Rouge busines," and are going to I
have a democratic convention.
This does not mean the defeat of
radlicalism thronghout tihe State; it
does not mean the redemption of
Louisiana; it does not mean lpatiot
ism, honesty and eourageous action
it means greed of offce; it means
that the State and ithe interest of the
country may go to the devil, if this
or that ring or elique can get up some
utiserable and contemptible local
dlodge to capture the eaty ofces of
New Orleans.
This is humillating, deplorable-
but not discouraging; and we say to
thie people of North Louisiana, let 1
the New' Orleans politiceal hammers
go their way. The people of that I
city are brave, honehrable pad true;
they know the vast iaterest at stake,
and we believe they will see to it,
while the hungry brood foffce- seek
ers among thena are dividiag oat the
eshrievalty, jadgeships, ete;, that good
and true men arem meat to thq Legis.
lature, But, however, that may be,
our duty is plain. We have orkan
ized the white man's party in {orth
Louisiana ad we must and will stand
by it. Itis our only hops; aye, the
only hope of the ~tte. If an~l mis.]
erable compromiae is sugsted here,
strike down the sggeston) if any I
white man accepts a radical negro ]
nomination, place npon him the ban
of public scorn and coatempt, and if l
any man seeks to divide or strength :
by attempting the independent dodge, 1
treat him uas a pblio enemy. Once I
more, weappel to every .white man
uin North s to do lhis whole
duty in this aq l to register
and vote, to denounce all cempro
nises with radellam or IeOsm,
and bend all hit energCles i the eleo
tion of honest ad espable white .lmen
to oSee.
The radical policy f nomiating
wlhite citizens apon their tickets amd
which some of. our friends are dis
posed to thl iIs acaleulated to insure
us good men whichever way the elec
tiou may turn, s port of a broadly
laid and insidious plan for the demo
ralization of the white man's move4
ment. Men who are elected on thq
radical tiacket loevitably become sym
pathizer and cooperators with rard
icalism : and when a man runs for of
flee on the radical ticket, whatever his a
profession may be, he is running, not
for the public good, but because he
iatds an office and can't get it from tis
-trust no such man. The radicals
understand this and will take any
man who is willing to sell out his own
dignity, honor and manhood, and at .
the same time his people, to them for p
a miserable office.
Whenever and wherever the rad- r
icals find that their power is waiting
and defeat threatening, they attempt
to recover their ground, either by q
nominating passably good men whom I'
they can tempt into their schemes g
through greed of office or by the in
dependent dodge. Thus in Caddo,
where the carpet-bag power is broken
and a white man's triumph a foregone i
conclusion, the radicals are trying to t
fix I;p a ticket that will demoralize
our line; while in Texas, where any
thing that smell of radicalism is hope
less, we find the radical conventions *
ad.journing without nominating, and a
imlmediately after their adjournment
independent candidates stepping into
the ring.-Slhtereport Times.
The Shreveport Times speaking of
our duties in the face of the late com- 1
promise, says t
In all this miserable business, how.
ever, there is nothing to be alarmed
at. The rumor sent through the dis- I
patches that compromises similar to
the one made in Terrebonne were to
be adopted all over the State, had no
authority, and doubtlessly grew out
of the fears of a class of men who are 1
always seeking to shirk an issue and 1
always have to be, in contests like I
this, forced into line. There will be
no compromise in North Louisiana.
The battle line we formed at the be
gining of the campaign remains intact,
and there is no faltering. Our ban
ners are spread upon every hill and
cover the heaven like a great white
clouod Yesterday we gave to the
dead; to-day belongs to the living
and its Issues ;
"This is not an hour for knells and tears,, I
But ftr helmets *fraced and serried spears,'
Louisiana call upon every white
man upon her soil to do his duty, and
that duty is now to bend all his ener
gies to establish within her borders the
supremacy of the white race; the su
premacy of civilization, of law and
justice; and he who falters in the
struggle is a craven unfit to play his
part among men. At the battle of
Inkerman a shell from the Russian
batteries tore from the hands of a
British corporal the flag of his regi
meet, and at the same moment a
grape-shot broke both his hips; but
falling, the gallant soldier caught the
bunting with his teeth and expired
with it there. It is not reasonable to
expect every man to be a hero, but
if a people would preserve their liber
ties, if they would accomplish great
results in times like these; if they
would win victory over combinations
in wrong and infamy, they must be
animated by something of the uncon
querable spirit of the corporal of In
kerman. Let the people then stand
by their capse, determined to main
tain it by every agency in their pow
er. That the overthrow of the legal
government of the State by Federal 1
power was a great misfortune cannot
be denied, and that it has caused con
fusion and faltering in our ranks is
true., Indeed the events of the last
two week have, in a measure, disconr
certed our plans, and time and again
the question has been asked what
shall we do Let not that question be
asked again. At the battle fWater
loo, when the fate of the day' was un
certain and the English line was
wavering, Wellington rode np to a
cavalry commander and ordered him
to move. "Which way t" asked the
officer. "Forward by G--d," res
ponded the iron Duke, the lightnings
of his soul blazing in his eyes. Peo
ple of North Louisiana, those of you
who wish to know what to do or how
to move, the Duke of Wellington has
told you--"Forward."

Platform of the White People's
Party.
We, the white people of Lodisiana, em
bracing the Democratic Party, the Con
servative Party, the White Main's Party,
the Liberal Party, the Reform Party aind
all others opposed to the Kellogg usur
pation do solemnly resolve and declare :
I. That the government now existing
in Louisiana originated in, and has been
maintained by force and fraud, in oppo
sition to the will of a large majority of
the voters of the State; in opposition to
the principles of the Constitution of the
United States and in violation of every
principle of justice and liberty.
2 1 hat the domninant faction of the
Radical party in this State has, by false
and fraudulent representations, inflanmed
the passions and prejudices of the ne
groes, as a race, against the whites, and
has thereby made it necessary for the
white pieople to unite and act together in
self-defense and the preservation of white
civilization.
3. That the rights of all men under the
Constitution and laws of the land must
be respected and preserved inviolate, it.
respective of race, color or previous con
dition, but we deny that Congress can
Constitutionally enact laws to force the
two races into social union or equality.
4. That the white people of Louisiana
have no desire to deprive the colored
people of any rights to which they are en
titled, but we are convinced that the re
form. imperatively demanded, can be
effected only by electing to office white
men of known capacity and integrity
and we believe that large numbers of
colored citizens will vote with us to se
cure a government which must be bene
ficial alike to both races.
5. That we disclaim earnestly any in
tention of carrying, or attempting to car
ry, the approaching election by violence,
and that charges to this effect emanating
from onr Radi-:al enemies, are without
foundation and are falsely made for the
purpose of obtaining the aid of the mil
itary force of the United States in order
to over-awe the people, perpetuate the
existing usurpation and subvert the true
principles of the government.
6. That W P. Kellogg is a mere usurp
er and we denounce hunm as ech, that his
government is arbitrary, unjust and op
pressive; and that it can maintain it
self only through Federal interference.
7. That the election and registration
laws under which this election is being
conducted were intended to perpetuate
the usurpation by depriving the people
and especially our natrralized citizens of
an opportunity to register and vote, but
we announce, distinctly, that it is the
determination of the people to have a
fair and free .election and to see that the
result is not changed by fraud or violence.
S. That we extend to all our race in
every clime the right hand of fellowship
and a cordial invitation to come and set
tie among us, and unite their destinies
with ours.
9. That while we are in favor of meet
ing punctually the payment of the legit
imate debt of Louisiana, we are immo
vably opposed to the recognitions issued
in the name of the State, and we pledge
ourselves to make a searching investiga
tion in the matter.
We advise our people to vote against
t heamendments to the Constitution pro
posed by the usurping Legislature and
pledge ourselves on the restoration of the
rovernment to honest hands, to provide
for the payment of all honest indebted
ness of the State.
THa DUTY or SUPERVISORS.--The

For more than half a century the 1
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY

widespread and unblemished reputation
for the unsurpassed parity, refinement
and excellence of the Serials, Sketches
