"NARROW BIGOTS 99 Trom the National Rip-Salv
All during the past campaign, not
only the Socialist press of America,
but many other righteous publications,
which' were not afraid of the tyranny
of the Roman Catholic Church, de
clared that the Roosevelt administra
tion had, in divers cases, catered to
the Roman Catholic Church, by ex
tending favors to that institution call
ed a church, and to the detriment of
the patriotic citizens of America.
The Socialist papers, with many
other outspoken, unafraid, and fear
less journals, declared that the Ro
man Catholic Church was preparing
to deliverer vote to William Howard
Taft for the favors shown that church
by Mr. Taft.
During this campaign, hundreds,
yea, thousands of Protestants wrote
Theodore Robsevelt in regard to these
accusations, but not a single reply
did they receive from *‘Noisy Teddy.”
But as soon as the election was over,
and the goods had been delivered to
William Howard Taft, and he was
elected President of the United States,
then this mighty “Teddy” took his
pen in hand to denounce those who
had trusted him, and who expected
him to inform them correctly in regard
to their inquiries; and not only did
he ridicule and revile them for these
questions, that they propounded to
him, but he called all of those who
had written him, in regard to this
matter, “NARROW BIGOTS,” and
the essence of his reply was that they
should be ashamed of trying to drag
a man’s religion into politics, and fur
ther instructed them that he expected
to see a Roman Catholic president of
the United States.
It is a known and indisputable fact
that the JESUITS are the most in
fluential and powerful body in the
Roman Catholic Church, and this en
tire Romish political machine, as the
Roman Catholic Church is nothing
more nor less than a political machine,
looks up to the Jesuits as their lead
ers, and Mr. Roosevelt knows this to
be a fact.
Now, that our readers may more
fully understand what the Jesuits of
the Roman Catholic Church believe,
we herewith publish the Jesuit’s oath,
which we take from the December is
sue of Thomas E. Watson’s “JEF
FERSONIAN MAGAZINE,” which
is owned and edited by the Populists’
late candidate for president of the
United States, and a man whom the
world respects, regardless of political
beliefs; this terrible oath follows:
THE JESUITS’ OATH.
“I, A. 8., now in the presence of
Almighty God, the Blessed Virgin
Mary, the Blessed Michael the Ar
changel, the Blessed St. John the Bap
tist, the Holy Apostles St. Peter and
St. Paul and the saints and Sacred
Host of Heaven, and to you, my
Ghostly Father, I do declare from my
heart, without mental reservation,
that the Pope is Christ’s Vicar Gen
eral and is the true and only Head
of the Universal Church throughout
the earth, and that by virtue of the
Keys of binding and loosing given to
His Holiness by Jesus Christ, He
hath power to depose Heretical
Kings, Princes, States, Common
wealths and Governments, all being
illegal without his sacred confirmation,
and that they may safely be destroyed.
Therefore, to the utmost of my pow
er, I will defend this doctrine and His
Holiness’s rights and customs against
all Usurpers of the Heretical or Prot
estant Authority whatsoever, especial
ly against the now pretended Author
ity and Church in England and all
Adherents in regard that they be
Usurped and Heretical, opposing the
Sacred. Mother Church of Rome.
“I do renounce and disown any Al
legiance as due to any heretical Kling,
Prince, or State, named Protestant, or
obedience to anjr-of their inferior
Magistrates or officers.
“I do further declare the doctrine
of the Church of England, of the Cal
vinists, Huguenots and other Protest
ants, to be damnable, and those to be
damned who will not forsake the
same. Ido further declare that I will
help, assist and advise all or any of
His Holiness’s agents in any place
wherever I shall be; and to do my ut
most to extirpate the heretical Prot
estant doctrine, and to destroy all
their pretended power regal or other
wise. I do further promise and de
clare, that notwithstanding I am dis
pensed with to assume any religion he
retical for the propagation of the Mo
ther Church’s interst, to keep secret
and private all her agents’ counsels
as they entrust me, and not to divulge,
directly or indirectly, by word, writ
ing or circumstance whatsoever, but
to execute all which shall be protect
ed, given in charge or discovered unto
me, by you, my Ghostly Father, or by
any one of this convent.
‘ ‘All of which I, A. B„ do swear by
the Blessed Trinity, and Blessed Sac
rament which I am about to receive,
to perform, on my part to keep invio
lable; and do call on all the Heavenly
and Glorious Host of Heaven to wit
ness my real intentions to keep this,
my oath. In testimony whereof, I
take this most Holy and Blessed Sac
rament of the Eucharist and witness
the same further with my hand and
seal, in the face of the holy convent. ’ ’
Now, Mr. Reader, is it “NARROW
BIGOTRY” for the Protestant
churches of the land to hate an insti
tution which makes its leaders take
an oath that, THE POPE IS
CHRIST’S VICAR GENERAL, AND
IS THE TRUE AND ONLY HEAD
OF THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH
THROUGHOUT THE EARTH?—If
it is wrong to doubt this damnable
statement, then Theodore Roosevelt is
right in condemning the Protestants
of the nation, and calling them
‘ 4 NARROW BIGOTS. ’ ’ Listen 1
“HIS HOLINESS (meaning the
Pope), BY JESUS CHRIST, HAS
POWER TO DEPOSE HERETICAL
KINGS, PRINCES, STATES, COM
MONWEALTHS, AND GOVERN
MENTS, ALL BEING ILLEGAL
WITHOUT HIS SACRED CONFIR
MATION, AND THAT THEY MAY
SAFELY BE DESTROYED.
THEREFORE, TO THE UTMOST
OF MY POWER I WILL DEFEND
THIS DOCTRINE AND HIS HOLI
NESS’S RIGHTS AND CUSTOMS
AGAINST ALL USURPERS OF THE
HERETICAL OR PROTESTANT
AUTHORITY.” And you, Mr.
Protestant Voter, are called a
“NARROW BIGOT” by the presi
dent of the United States, for hating
£>l)e 3efffcrsonlan
an organization which boldly declares
that it will aid the Pope of Rome in
destroying all “PROTESTANT AU
THORITY WHATSOEVER.”
The Socialist press, and many oth
er fearless journals, have told you,
over and over again, that the Roman
Catholic Church has no politics, but
all that it wants is POWER, POW
ER, POWER, and the following par
agraph from the Jesuits’ Oath, un
doubtedly sustains our warning.
“I DO RENOUNCE AND DISOWN
ANY ALLEGIANCE AS DUE TO
ANY HERETICAL KING, PRINCE,
OR STATE, NAMED PROTEST
ANT, OR OBEDIENCE TO ANY OF
THEIR INFERIOR MAGISTRATES
OR OFFICERS.” And still the
president of the United States upholds
this TREASONABLE DECLARA
TION, and calls the Protestant world
“NARROW BIGOTS” for not up
holding such treason. Listen again!
THE DOCTRINES OF THE
CHURCH OF ENGLAND, OF THE
CALVINISTS, HUGUENOTS AND
OTHER PROTESTANTS TO BE
DAMNABLE, AND THOSE TO BE
DAMNED WHO WILL NOT FOR
SAKE THE SAME. I DO FUR
THER DECLARE THAT I WILL
HELP, ASSIST AND ADVISE ALL
OR ANY OF HIS HOLINESS’S
AGENTS (meaning the Pope) IN
ANY PLACE WHEREVER I SHALL
BE; AND DO MY UTMOST TO EX
TIRPATE THE HERETICAL PRO
TESTANT DOCTRINE AND TO
DESTROY ALL OF THEIR PRE
TENDED POWER, REGAL OR
OTHERWISE.” And for the Pro-
testants opposing the destruction of
their public schools and other institu
tions, including their churches, they
are called “NARROW BIGOTS” by
the president of the United States,
and never a protest offered by Wil
liam Howard Taft, who claims to be
in harmony with the Protestant in
stitutions, which the Roman Catholic
Church calls DAMNABLE, AND
THOSE D AMNED WHO WILL NOT
FORSAKE THE PROTESTANT IN
STITUTIONS OF AMERICA.

The 'Dalvn of the Cotton Century
By Daniel J. Sully.
The American people have begun
to realize the significance in the fact
that alien nations that never saw a
cotton-plant liave long since entered
the Kingdom of Cotton and now
divide dominion among themselves,
excluding the United States —the
country in which the cotton is grown.
The reign of cotton is forever. As
long as the race survives cotton
goods will be worn in multiplying
forms, but the countries that now sell
the finished pdoducts of cotton to
the world have no assurance of per
manence in that trade. America’s
ultimate control in the ectton-world
in inevitable.
Knowing our latent power, we can
afford to look candidly at some con
temporary (facts. Thley are not
flattering to our- national pride.
oath, as you can read it for yourself,
and behold all of its terribleness, and
awfulness, and after you have absorb
ed al that is in it, contrary to the con
stitution of the United States, and det
rimental to our public schools, and all
of the other Protestant institutions,
EVERY PROTESTANT CHURCH
INCLUDED, you will then realize
what your imbecility and your igno
rance at the ballot box has done for
you. 1 can not but believe that the
next time that Theodore Roosevelt oi
William Howard Taft bobs up for of
fice that the Protestant world will
have “NARROW BIGOTS” thunder
ed in their ears so terribly that they
will think more of the PUBLIC
SCHOOLS OF AMERICA AND
PROTESTANT INSTITUTIONS OF
THE LAND than they do of the Ro
man Catholic Church, which swears
that they MAY SAFELY BE DE
STROYED, AND THAT THEY ARE
DAMNABLE, AND THAT THOSE
ARE DAMNED WHO WILL NOT
FORSAKE THEM.
This man Roosevelt, the greatest
“wind-jammer” and colossal “eon”
America has ever had to endure, has
always talked about his great stam
ina, and his being unafraid to make
public declarations when the case de
manded; but upon the eve of the elec
tion, When tens of thousands of Prot
estants were pelting him with ques
tions in regard to the Roman Catholic
Church, he lost all of his stamina, and
his bravery served him not, and he,
coward like, refused to answer a sin
gle question in regard to the Roman
Catholic Church until after the elec
tion was over, and then, when he did
answer, he called the Protestant world
“NARROW BIGOTS”Yor loving the
public schools and Protestant churches
and Protestant institutions of Amer
ica, and despising the Roman Catholic
Church, because she despises all that
is near and dear to the Protestant
world. You, Mr. Roosevelt, with a
spine of sand, will get YOURS if you
ever bob up for office in Protestant
America again, providing, however,
that the Protestant voters are not all
consummate damphools, which we have
come to the conclusion the majority
are.-—‘National Rip-Saw.
They reveal a world of opportunity
passed by.
If we turn aside for a moment
from the paradox and irony of
spinners in Lancashire, Saint Gall,
or Chemnitz, three thousand miles
and more from a cotton-field, turning*
out finished cotton garments for
many peoples, including some of the
Americans who grew the raw material,
we can admire the volume of cotton
goods massed in the great world
movements of trade. From the fac
tories of Europe and Japan count
less ships carry increasing cargoes
of cotton fabrics to every civilized
port. Goods woven of this staple
constitute a vast proportion of the
merchandise hauled by train across
all continents: and where modern
