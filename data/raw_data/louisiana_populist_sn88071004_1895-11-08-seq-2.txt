A gain of 25 per cent over the tei

would give them several Southern the

we believe that some at them will La
realise a gainof 50 per ceut. bl

'I[his country has nothing either
to hole or fear from the I)eano
" cratic party. It is the great politi
cal reservoir of lost causes and op- i
Iportinities. It is what a printer
-calls "pi," crudely valualde for
te what there is lost in it, but practi
;h cally useless for lack of distribution.
Whenever it has happened to
elect :i broadly patriotic president,
<i it has been dazed by surprise and
chagrin, and charged him with
breach of promise and seduction.

HI out being honest, but is now
so swampld in lust for office as to
have no moral character. It differs i
Sessentially from its great rival in e
nothing but discretion, that is, by
Na curious coincidence, exactly as a
j hypocrite differs from a hog. The
, comparison bristles with difficul- a
ties, and 1 will not pursue it, but t
if you were to demand grounds for t
0 the abrupt and none too elegant
(P opinions I have uttered, I would
o simply point you to the last Con- t
gress, "the (Great American D)es- i
ert" of legislation, with its months
of joint irresolution and its all but
unanimous "drunk" at the finish,
when it ran over its own end, t
0 twelve hours, for lack of enough l
sober men to adjourn ; with also- r
lute confidence that any moderate- t
ly thoughtful contemplation of it
0 would prove that neither party or
0 dinarily possesses any coherent
and persistent love of country, R
above the level of party spoils, in- y
dividual ambitions and sectional
greed, or any sense of shame.
It must not, of course, be
0 thought that I deny patriotism to °
0 Democrats and Republicans ; it tis
of the parties I am speaking. They a
do not represent the ultimate and h
essential civic virtue of the men
who compose them, but only the
average fighting weight of the
0 happy-go-lucky public somnambu- I
lism, that we call popular self- d
government.-Ram's Horn.
For answer to the Enterprise's f,
article of last week, headed "Par- i,
Ish Politics," we refer it to our f
clippling from the Ram's Horn, in n
this issue. This clipping evident- b
ly refers to the national parties, ,
but the national party is made up
of State parties and State parties n
e of "local" parties, and the Popu- i
lists in this parish do not want to e
follow the tail of the dog when
they know the head is pointed in
the wrong direction.

Our s1eatr-s.
SThe proceedings of the People's P
) party convention for the 19th Sen- I
atorial District, appearing else
r where in this issue, show the nomi- ti
nations made Oct. 19th. Mr. ii
r Freeman was present and accept- c
) ed, but Mr. Gamble not being pres- I
- ent and not expecting anything of h
the kimn, without giving the mat- d
i ter a second thought, replied to the a
a convention's telegram by declining P
a the nomination. So the conven- o
I tion met again last Thursday, 31st II
I alt. During the interim Mr. Gam- a
ble learned that his nomination by E
I the convention was unanimous, that f
the Democratic nominations were t4
very unsatisfactory, and being
urged biy prominent Populists in
Sabine, Red River and this parish,
he decided to accept. His decision H
being telegraphed the convention, a
they confirmed their former nomi- P
nations, and adjourned. H
So our nominees are Mr. D. IG. P
Freeman, of Red River, who is al
ready in the field making speeches P
and waging an active and agreasive t
campaign, and Mr. E. J. Gamble,
of this p'rih, who is one of the a
best posted and most persevering
workers in the party.
We are proud of this ticket, and ta
we are atisied the entire district
p will be proud of its Senators when

els.' h.re ab, t til, h te te that t1he
Populist.; will nominate ai State
ticket tIhat will not be objcctitnal
to dissatistied demnl'ocrats., anid that
this ticket will be indorsdl Iy the
Sugar Planters Association and the
Republicans. This is what the
Item has beenu fearing all alon_,
1 because if it is dlone the (lays of
1)Democratic rule in Louisiana are
Inumbered. In fearing such pro
bable action we endeavored to urge
a plan by which such dangerous
results might be avoided. Later
the Times-DIemocrat bravely came
forward in adlvoccy of the same
plan, but the shallow little adlmin
istration organs throughout the
State, who doubtless feared that
if the white pIople were united
again their favorites would get left,
denounced the Times-Democrat in
a shameful manner for doing that,
which alone will reunite the white
p)ople and preserve I)emocratic
supremacy in the State. Just so
sure as the program now talked of
is carried into execution, just so
sure the supremacy of the I)eno
cratic party in this State ceases.
We are speaking here earnestly
and honestly for the salvation of
the l)emocratic party and not for
the welfare of any candidate for
the office. If others who opl sse
the plan could look at the subject
in the same way the party would
profit largely by it.-Ca'pital Item.
A worse thing might he done
than indorsing the Populist ticket
by the "dissatisfied" democrats and
republicans. They have nothing
to gain by staying by their res
pective parties, the leaders of
which seem determined upon a
gold standard platform and ticket,
you need look for nothing else. A
gold standard ticket will as sure
be put in the field as two and two
make four, and Foster will be at
the head, and the question of white
supremacy be ignored. Anything
honorable or dishonorable to hold
the reins and reap the benefits.
And what will the opposition do
It is true that many of our good
democrats such as Pickett, Adams,
Hicks, and others are clamoring
for something pure and prozress
ive in the way of Iallot reform,
free silver and some of the reforms
needed in the interests of the la
boring classes. These questions
will be ignored by the administra
tion goldhug faction, or so wofully
mixed up for a blind, that no mean
ing can be gathered from it, or
else made to mean either way.
Ye "dissatisfied democrats," will
you be led into the trap again F or
will you stand upon your own
manhood and vote with a party
that openly advocates your princi
ples. Never mind the party name.
The name democracy once so hon
ored now so smirched by the ac
tion of its corrupt leaders that it
is now almost a reproach to be
called a democrat. The rank and
file of the party are all right and
honest in their convictions and are
democrate in the true sense of the
word, but their leaders have taken
posession of the name and nail into
office under its ma~etic influence.
In other words "stolen the livery
of heaven to serve the devil in."
Be deceived no longer; you can
not purify the party ; if you wish
to accomplish anything you must
come out of it.-Lakesile Review.
Gov. McEnery had his Jim
Houston New Orleans combine,
and now Gov. Foster has his Fitz
patrick combine. None of the
Houston people were sent to the
penitentiary for their rascality,
while quite a number of the Fitz
patrick crowd have been senteneed
to that institution. The present
New Orleans politicians seem to be
a worse set than ever before, and
Gov. Foster must want office very
much indeed to mix with such rot
tenness.-Town Talk.
It is not the radical man who is
needed to lead the people, it is the
honest, sober, fearless man who
loves humanhood, and who is as
eool s he is brave in the presence
of the foe.-Ex.

as you kick and then come back

you expect to get it in the neck

Not much. Remember our ad
vice, and act thereon when the op
portunity presents itself.
Our readers will remember that
the State Central Committee made
a ruling that none but white men,
who in past elections have voted
for Democratic nominees, shall be
allowed to participate in the se
lection of delegates to attend the
State nominating convention. This
cuts out all ''sugar" Republicans
and Populists who wanted to come
back to the Democratic fold and
stay there. It was fortunate for
Mayor Fitzpatrick, now a leader
of the Fosterites, that this ruling
was not in force in the past. Some
of our readers will remember that
in years gone by he was a leading
Republican politician in New Or
leans-during the blackest Radical
days.-Town Talk.
An Indian once heard a white
man bragging of how nice it was
to sleep on feathers. That night
be put a few feathers under him
but felt no more comfort than
when he slept on the bare ground.
So it is in advertising. Advertis
ing is a good thing if you use
enough of it and keep it up. But
a little bit with the length of time
as brief as the space used, is as tn
satisfactory as the Indian's feather
bed.
