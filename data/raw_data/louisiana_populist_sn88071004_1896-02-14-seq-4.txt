It is generally recognised that the
number of words used in our daily life
is very small. Perhaps not more than
two or three thousand in all are in
common use. Of course, there are
some few people like dictionary makers
who know more, but the average man
gets along very comfortably on that
limited supply. It is only when fow
ery writers undertake to decribe the
indescribable that new words have to
be invented to tell what they think
they see. The man who comes home
late, and whose wife talks to him fo.
two hours in a whisper, to keep from
waking the baby, believes that there
are many more words in use than is
generally supposed, and that there is
no earthly use in adding any more to
the visible supply. It is only when he
begins to tell lies that he wishes for
more and strange words that he knows
cannot be recalled. As a matter of
fact, it takes but very few words for a
man to tell all he knows.

Amerklu.. Laoe stock ,n England.
We believe few English farmers
have any adequate conception of the
rapidity and enormous expansion with
which live stock imports from fore. n
countries and the colonies, alike in cat
p. tle, sheep and horses, are rapidly de
re veloping themselves. If the Americans
s and Canadians are balked in one par
ticular import of live stock, they read
ily take to another. Since being for
bidden to send any cattle to this coun
to try except for purposes of slaughter,
L. they have taken to fitting out monster
r- steamboats to bring fat beasts hither
13 alive in large numbers, and the Austra
w lians are following suit by straining
every effort to make the same kind of
trading successful. But not satisfied
with this, both Americans and Cana
dians are turning their attention to the
O imports of horses and sheep, and we
is propose very briefly to point out how
f- enormously the imports of both have
g increased in the past year, and are still
; increasing. The total number of horses
imported in the ten months of 1895,
ended October 31, was 29,628, valued
at £787,465, compared with 19,764 im
ported in the corresponding ten months
of 1894, valued at £462,999. All of them
did not come from the two countries
t named,it is true,but by far the majority
, did. For instance, 7,879 were mares, of
o which 3,559 were from the United
States and 3,106 from Canada. The
d geldings were 19,991, of which 6,660
were American and 7,187 Canadian.
Perhaps it may be said this expansion
of the import trade in horseflesh has
not yet affected our home breeding so
s as to make good market geldings very
o cheap, nor even the best descriptions of
a hunters and carriage horses; and we
all know that for the very highest class
of pedigree Shire horses there have
I been grand prices during the past year.
But when we look at the vast areas of
prairie and rich agricultural lands still
to be occupied in the United States
and the Canadian Dominion, and the
shrewdness and enterprise of farmers
in those countries in whatever kinds of
stock they can find a market for in this
country, we greatly apprehend that it
will be found ultimately that they can
produce and send us all kinds of equine
animals at lower prices than they can
be remuneratively raised on the over
taxed and high-rented farms of great
Britain.-Mark Lane Express.
United States Cavalry Horsey
The annual report of the quartermas
ter general contains some items that are
of interest. Among other remarks he
says that the contract system for the
supply of horses continues to give gen
eral satisfaction and the standard has
been gradually improved since the sys
tem was adopted. The average cost
of cavalry horses during the year was
$95.44, and that of artillery horses
$148.04. Our cavalry mount of to-day
excels that of any previous time, and
all information gathered tends to show
that it is superior to that of foreign
countries. The cessation of Indian
wars and hostilities on the Rio Grande
have rendered it unnecessary to fur
ther maintain post transportation on a
field campaign basis, and in October
last orders were issued for a new al
lowance of draft and pack animals for
several military departments, and di
rectiag the sale of all surplus animals
This reduction in the number of ani
mals, wagons, harness, etc., will effect
considerable saving in the appropria
tion. The average cost of team horses
during tie year was $167.82 and of
mules $114.64. The reduction in num
ber by reason of sale, death, etc., was
1,422 cavalry and artillery horses, 1,088
mules; this left on hand at the end of
the year 6,189 cavalry and artillery
horses, 247 team horses and mules.
