A RAILWAY KNIGHT.
The Story of a Train Boy's
Bravery.
The Chicago special bore an unusual
ly heavy load that day.
Vacation was over and homeward
travel had begun. There was not a
single empty seat in any of the four
sloepers, and at each stop there were
new demands for berths.
" Spirited conversations between the
Wagner conductor and irate passen
gers who had failed to bespeak their
berths were frequent, and the last
berth, the upper one in the rear car,
reserved for the conductor himself,
had just been given up to a flurried,
all important personage who had in
sisted on his right to a whole section.
So now things began to quiet down.
The passengers unbent from their dig
nity and began to compare vacation
notes; the men betook themselves to
the smoking department, and the
train boy ceased for awhile his jour
neys through the cars, offering his
wares of candy, gum, books and maga
zines.
Trade this side of Niagara didn't
amount to much. He had learned that
by experience.
At first magazines sold pretty well
but the real demand did not come till
after they had passed Suspension
Bridge and the stop at Falls View sta
tion was made. Then was the time to
offer souvenirs of Niagara for sale.
Indeed Dan knew about how many
copies he would selL
A few months' experience on the
train had given him a pretty keen in
sight into the habits and desires of the
passengers.
At a glance he could tell who would
and who would not buy of him, and
just what women needed a little per
suasion and a pleasant smile-to in
duce a purchse. -
In fact Dan's smile was a valuable
part of his stock in trade, and he used
it to advantage, for it was a pleasant
smile-and it made the round, freckled
face very winning.
He was sorting over his books now
preparatory to one more trip through
the cars, before offering peanuts and
candy again, when the train drew up
at a dingy, dilapidated station. They
were stopping for water he knew, and
he went to the platform and jumped
to the ground.
It was a relief after the rocking
train.
Much to his surprise he found the
conductor in earnestconversation with
two women.
"Oh, but you must take her some
how," he heard the younger of the
women exclaim in a distressed voice.
"You see there ain't any other way
to send her, and her mother expects
her sure, and she'll be at the station to
take her off, and she'll be a real good
girl and not trouble you a bit, won't
you, Bessie?"
Here she pulled forward a little blue
eyed girl and the conductor's eyes
rested thoughtfully on her.
Dan drew near-he was interested to
know what the conductor would do.
"They'll be most crazy if she don't
come," added the other woman. "And
it will put them out dreadfully 'cause
they've got to start right off for Coleo
rado."
A sharp whistle recalled the conduo
tor, and he put one foot on the steps of
the car and stood, watch in hand, ready
to give the signal.
"Say, I'll kinder keep an eye on the
kid, if that's all you want," Dan said,
awkwardly, to the women. "Don't
know much 'bout children, but I guess
some of the women will tend to her?"
He gave an inquiring glance at the con
ductor.
"All right-I'm willing-jumpaboard,
will you, we're late now," and the con
ductor waved his hand.
Dan seized the child-ind placed her
lightly on the platform; and the train
began to move. He listenaed .to the part
ing directions of the two women, and
threw back the silver half dollar one
of them tried to slip int6 his hand
with a toss of his head, asibe shouted:
"I ain't no porter, and I'm a-doing this
to 'blige you."
Then he held the child tightly while
she waved her tiny handkerchief till
the station was a mere speck in the
distance
Tbhen he took her into the ear and
left her to amuse herself with the rolls
of lozenges while he made a trip
through the other cars. By the time
he got back she had made triends with
a lady across the aisle, who offered to
share her berth with the child, and be
fore the afternoon was over she was
playing games all over the car, and to
Dan's intense amusement she insisted
on eating supper with the man who
had made the greatest fuse over his
berth, but who, Besse idsisted, looked
the berth, with a "good night, every
body." that included the whole car, he
went back to the day coach and curled
up on a hard seat to sleep.
He slept sgndly, for, the day had
been a tiresome-one, Ibt after awhile
he began to dream. He thought that
Bessie had chewed gum till she grew
smaller and smaller and finally was
nothing but one of the prizes in the
bags of popcorn, a little asugr image
which he was about to eat when
Crasht
Dan was awake now. In an
he was rushing toward the sleeper.
Something dreadful had happened!
The train shook and shivered and
swayed.
There was a second erash and a tear
Ieg sound, and the end of the car was
torn off and a cloud of steam rushed in
and about him.
The shook threw him to his feet, but
he crawled on. There was Bessie, he
had promised to take care of her.
What would he say to the mother if
she were killed?
Yet it really wasn't his fault.
Would he never get to the end of the
car?
It seemed ages before he reached the
platform, and his hand grasped the
twisted brakes Overturned on the
track before him was the sleeper. The
dim gray light of the early morning 1
just showed its outlines. Farther than
that he could not see.
He jumped from the platform and
landed on the upturned side of the ear.
He could hear cries inside and
through one of the windows a head
was thrust. With his heels he broke
the glass of the window nearest him,
then he crawled on to the next. and
next, breaking each in turn, till finally
he reached the fourth.
This was where Iemsie was.
Here he crawled in, but there was no
one in the berth.
It was lighter now. The sun must
have come up very quickly.
Then a smell of smoke revealed the
cause. The broken lamp at the end of
the car had set the bedding on fire.
The flames were spreading fast.
Through the broken windows people
were rushing, men and women, and
there were groans and shrieks on all
sides.
But he could see nothing of Besste.
Could he have been mistaken in the
carl
Suddenly from beneath a pile of
clothing he saw a tiny hand thrust out,
and he heard a stifled cry.
Eagerly he pushed aside the heavy
blankets and pulled the child out. By
the light of the flames now rapidly
nearing them he could see how white
she looked, and her eyes were closed.
Could he be too late?
Hie tried to climb out of the window,
but the seat on which he stood, broken
by the crash, fell beneath his weight,
and he was thrown back into the ear.
He struck heavily, and then there was
a sharp pain in his head and little Bes
sie almost fell from his arms.
He seized the broken bell rope that
hung from its rings, and, placing the
child on his back, bound the cord
around and around, thus binding her
tightly to him.
Then he tried a second time to gain
the window. This time there was a
hand held down to help him. and in a
moment he felt the soft grass beneath
him and there was a sudden movement
of the little body. pressed close to him.
Then there was a terrible whirring
sound in his ears and the blackest
night seemed to settle over everything
and he became unconscious.
Newsof the disaster traveled fast,
and when the train bearing the
wrecked passengers drew into Detroit
there were hundreds of anxious friends
inquiring for dear ones. Strong men
were crying, and faces were white
with horror as they listened to the
story of the drbadful collision.
In one corner, faint and weary, sat a
sad-faced mot er, while her husband
wandered hither and thither in, a vain
search for their child.
"A - little girl with blue eyes?" re
peated one of the, i.engers after him.
°" Let me see, there was one but-here,
potter, perhaps you can tellthe gentle
man," and the passenger hastened
" There was one child killed, sir," the
porter replied slowly. "I hope it ain't
yours, I'm sure. Just step this way
please."
Re trno&d.to do - so_ with tears blind
ing his eyes. But a tinW..hand caught
hold of his coat and a cbildish voice
cried: "Don't run away, papa-ain't
you glad to see Bersie?'
"I told the ladies I'd see she got
to you safe," Dan explained, as they
were being driven to Besale's home.
"And when we was struck I knew
there wasn't no one else to look out
for her, special, so I made straight for
her, and we managed to get out some
how, didn't we Bess?"'
Dan stroked the silky hair of the
child, and smiled at her with lips that
trembled.
Even now his -head was diszy and
there were queer pains running through
his body.
"Yes," cried Besasie, with a happy
laugh, as if recalling some aismt
time. "It was awful funny going to
sleep in those funny boles with crtains,
then I woke up and was under a great
big heap of blankets. Dan was real
good to me, Dan was, snd all his lovely
candy got burnt up to nothing, and 1
just think yon ougffht to give him some
new, 'canuse he took such good care o'
me, won't you, papa?"
Her sweet face was upturned and
her hand was slipped into Dan's-nd
he hastily swallowed a big lump in his
throat as he muttered:

HOME ATMOSPHERE.
Created by a .Kmewled e of ralrmealom
Arransmerat.
Of all the minor arts and sciences
none 'is more delightful in itself or
richer in its compensations than the
creation of the home atmosphere; and
although the ability to make a home
is a natural endowment of some for
tunate beings, it is not the less a talent
which may .be cultivated, and which
will eontinually repay the time and
eare devoted to its acquirement.
Men sometimes eleet.to live.together
in bachelor freedom, surrounding
themselves with qpmforts and luxuries,
having well-trained servants, so that
the household machinery moves with
out noise or jar, and then flat
ter' themselves .that they have
made s new Eden. Perhaps they
have; but it is in the Eden thatiexisted
before. "Heaven's last; best gift" was
bestowed up on the world, and at its
very best is only a lifeless imitation of
the beautiful reality, since It-lacks the
"womanly atmosphere of home," and
is without its nameless grace, its abid
ing sweetness, its indefinable -but
most potent charm. Yet a houseful of
women can make a home in the fullest
sense of all that the dear words in
eludes; indeed, a solitary dweller of
the gifted sex will succeed in invest
ing her belongings with the permanent
comfort and dainty grace which belong
to the -real home atmosphere. There
are houses and there are homes, and it
must be a very indifferent or a very
selfish woman who can not evolve the
latter from the least promising ele
ments, and take pride in improving it
to the utmost.
The majority of women possess what
Hawthorne calls "the gift of practical
arrangement," which is, he continues,
"a kind of natural magic that enables
these favored ones to bring out the
hidden capabilities of things around
them, and particularly to give a look
of habitableness to any place which,
for however brief a period, may happen
to be their home." Under the skillful
touch of these persons unpromising or
incongruous materials are brought into
subjection, harmonious arrangements
replace stiff outlines, defects are con
cealed and good points emphasized, so
that rooms which had been hard and
forbidding assume a genial and invit
ing aspect. These clever folks not only
work their spells upon unlovely sur
roundings, they accomplish what is
even more dilficult, by giving an air of
domesticity and use to the most splen
did apartment, effectually dispelling
that soulless magnificence which is so
depressing to warm-hearted every-day
people.-JHarper's Bazar.
FUNERAL WAS A FUNCTION.
But Society Came Net. and the Ramilyy
Was so meraSed.
I am to have a complete suit of semi
mourning made, for recently it seems
to me as if I do nothing else but at
tend funerals.
And here so much stress is laid on
funerals. Abroad we send our carp
riages. That is sufficient. Here we
must attend in person.
It is a bore, as well as extremely de
pressing. People seem to know if you
are there, you know, and are actually
disappointed if you do not put in so'
appearance.
Only recently a charming woman
was telling me of the funeral of a
friend, another very. lovely person,
whom I had the honor of knowing.
She said that the name of the de
ceased was seldom mentioned now,
because it brought up such painful
recollections, not connected with
d~eth itself-those were the bitter
sweet-but with the subsequent ob
sequies.
The dead lady was.sa "society leader,"
and when she died they arranged--that
is, the family-to have a celebrated
clergyman assist at the last rites, in a
very fashionable church, and they in
vited the smartest men in society to be
pallbearers, arranged an attractive mu
sical programme and ordered just the
proper thing in flowers, violets and all
that.
Well, there were, notwithstanding
this preparation, only about fifty peo
ple in the church.. Of course the
weather was bad, but the family has
never recovered from the slight.
Certain people are struck off their
visiting list, and one of the daughters
said to nme in reference to this event
that she feared to look in her mirror
for several days afterward-that she
had actually become "green from mor
tification. "-Vogue.
Responsive Gramblang.
An excellent though unconscious
criticism of the rapid and incoherent
manner in which too many congrega
tions perform their part of the "re
sponsive reading" of the Psalms on
Sunday, was made by a small boy on
his return from his first attendance at
church.
"Mamma," he remarked, "the people
don't like the minister, do they?"
"Why, certainly. Harold; what made
you ask such a question?" was the
reply.
"Well," said HIarold, sturdily, "he'd
read something, and then they'd all
grumble, and then he'd read some
more, and they'd all grumble agaa."

Advice.
There is probably no other conu
modity that the average man ia more
willing to give to his neighbors, and
more unwilling to receive, than ad
vice. Advice is very freauently given
in the wrong spirit, and it is probably
more frequently given by those who
have neither the prerogative nor the
ability to give advice that is of real
value. Experience is a good teacher,
and it is necessary for us to experi
mant; nevertheless, 'w'e can not aford
to learn everything by experience.
We must be guided by the counsel of
others who have experimented for us.

"I don't know which of them makes
me. tiredest," said the woman doctor,
looking up from her desk with a
wrinkled forehead and resigned sigh.
"No, I know the word isn't in the dic
tionary, but do let me use it."
"What's the provocation?" I asked.
She stuffed the papers into my lap.
"Here, read them. One's a letter from
the mother of three daughters, who
asks me if I think housework is healthy
for women; the second, oddly enough,
is another letter in the same line
from a magazine editor, asking me
to contribute to his symposiump,
'Housework or Business Life--Vhich
is Best Suited to the Physical
Woman?' One letter asks me to
answer as a woman and the other
appeals to me in my capacity as a
physician - I've forgdtten which is
which.- And the third is the first of
the. contributions tQ that precious sym
posium, which the editor sends me as
an example (or else a warning), and
enthusiastically proposes housework
as a cure for every ill feminine flesh is
heir to-a muscles-strengthener, nerve
sootjer. brain-developer and dear
knows what all; it makes the sick
well-" '"And the well sick," was the
irreverent interruption. "But what
are we going to do with them, and why
do they make you tired?"
"I'll show you what I am going to
do with them," and the offending pa
pers were poked into the waste-basket
with the point of a wicked-looking
pair of shears. "And the reason I'm
sick of being asked my opinion as to
the healthiness of housework is the
senselessness of such a query. Sup
pose it isn't, what does anybody pro
pose doing about it? We must all
take our share of it. It only
remains for men to begin asdung,
'Is business healthy?' to drive us quite
distracted. If you want my opinion
here it is, and weliome. I think house
work is a wearing, grinding treadmill
which fatigues strong women and
breaks delicate ones. That woman's
talk about 'exercise' and 'healthful va
riety of work' is all nonsense. Part of
the exercise is the continual lifting of
heavy weights, from buckets to babies,
and going up and down stairs, the two
worst things a woman can, do, and her
muscles are called into play as benefi
cially and more agreeably in a game of
tennis or a brisk walk as in handling
the broom or scrubbing brush. The
'variety of work' is only a: eupheuism
for saying that she never gets done.
"Continual standing is not healthy.
Neither is the breathing of dust and
ashes, nor slopping about in water,
nor standing over a hot stove, nor
saking a fire in a cold room, nor
half a dozen things included un
der the head of house work.
That's why I'm out of patience
with that woman who wrote for the
magazine symposium. As for the one
with the three daughters, I guess I
will answer her letter after all-fish it
up out of the basket, won't you?-and
say, 'Dear Madam: No, housework is
not healthy. Neither is living healthy.
We go into it, young and fresh, and
round and rosy; it leaves us old, and
worn and wrinkled, and feeble. What
do you expect to do about it?' "
"Give her daughters a business train
ing," I suggested.,
"Did I say business was any bet
ter?" demanded the woman doctor.
"I've as many patients who have
wrecked their health over the count
ing-desk as the wagh-tub or the stove.
And it is absured to generalize that
way and put 'business,' including such
widely different occupations as;
teaching, acting, selling goods,
writing stories, and tending a
loom, in one scale, and housework
in the other, and try to strike a bal
ance between them. Housework is
healthier than some businesses and
less healthy than others. Taken all in
all, the housekeeper's chances for
physical well-being are a little better,
for she has none of the terrible nervous
strains over the possibility of losing
her position, and no matter how rushed
she is, she can, and does if she is sen
sible, let everything go for a moment
or an hour while she rests or sleeps.
If the workingwoman be a store or
factory employe, she suwers a steadier
strain of standing than the~veriest
horsehold drudge. But the odds aren't
sufficient to warrant enthusiasm, and
I, for one, refuse to say anything-iha
print, that is-about it."
"Except by proxy," I warned her.
and she said that, of course, she had
expected that.--Boston Herald.
Common Errore In speeeh.
The verb to get is one of our much
misused words; it means to acquire,
win, obtain; and, primarily, it signi
fies the putting forth of effort to at
tain something. Consequently it is
not only superfluous, but incorrect, to
speak of a man as "getting drowned"
or "getting sick," and you may, unfor
tunately, "have a cold," but it is im
possible that you "have a cold." At
this moment no exceptions occur to
the writer to the rule that got should
never be used in connection with have,
which alone suiciently expresses pos
session. Say "I have the picture," not
*"" have got the picture.'. "The dog
has got a broken leg." The irregular
verbs lay and lie are frequently con
founded. Lay Is an active or transi
tive verb, and lie is passive or intransi.
tive. We lay things down or have laid
them down; but we and things lie at
rest. You lie down, have lain down,
will lie down or are lying down; she
lay down yesterday and is going to lie
down this afternoon. A frequent error
is to cosfound the past tenses of these
verbs. One should say: "Mary laid
the book on the table, and lay down
herself;" but the book lies on the to
ble."-Demorest Magazine.

HOUSE DECO RATION. -

of Color Schemes for Bnoms.
"I have been helping an old ashoe
chum to refurnish her house," msaid
young woman of observation, "and I
have learned more about color eaeet -
in one week than I ever knew before.
You see, houses are not painted or pa
pered as they used to be, on the old,
simple plan of 'that will look well
here.' and 'such a pattern will be all
right there.' but according to settled
laws, canons and. rules. It's quite a
scientific matter now, I assure you.
"Yellows, for instance, are all right
for a hall or vestibule, but they must'
not be used in any room in which one
rests or reads or works. Why? Be
cause yellows do not absorb any light,
but are strong reflectors, and the re
flected rays of -light aft not only try
ing to the eyes, but positively
the brain and the spirit, creatia
distinct disturbance of thctle
centers. So the modern ete d
