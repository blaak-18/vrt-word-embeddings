“STAR” STICKS TO LIES
A SENATORIAL PUZZLE:
Res3 l ution in Mayfield Case Has So
Many Earmarks of a “Trumped-Up”
Affair that No Charges Can Now Be
Found by Those “Interested.”
Washington, D. C. —Senator May
field, Democrat, of Texas, has scored
first blood in a preliminary skirmish
in the Senate in the case where his
opponent is seeking to have him oust
ed on the grounds of “excessive ex
penditures and illegal practices.”
Senator Borah of Idaho, started
the ball lolling when he objected to
the wording of the resolution com
ing from the audit committee of the
Senate authorizing the privileges
and elections committee to make an
investigation of all charges made to
the Senate, all counter charges and
any other charges which might arise
in connection with the Texas con
test.* Senator Borah said it was
absurd and ridiculous to think that
anyone can presume to make any
sort of charges against a United
States senator and have an investi
gation made without disclosing in
detail what those charges are; in
other words, without disclosing to
Senate and to the senator concerned
the exact nature of all charges. He
denounced it as unfair to the senator
involved, to the Senate which had a
right to know on what grounds a
senator is to be tried and he called
for an explanation.
Senator Borah was joined by Sen
ators Brandegee of Connecticut;
Robinson of Arkansas; Walsh of
Montana; Shields of Tennessee; He
flin of Alabama; Norris of Nebraska,
and Fletcher of Florida, all demand
ing to know the nature of the charges
filed against the member from Texas.
Senator Spencer of Missouri, chair
man of the committee on privileges
and elections, defended the wording
of the resolution and said the papers
filed with the Senate and referred to
his committee for consideration were
so voluminous that neither he nor
any member of the committee had yet
had time in which to go over them
and digest the entire nature of all
the charges. He said as nearly as he
could get at the case that the charges
referred to “excessive expenditures
and illegal practices.”
The senators who jumped all over
the wording of the resolution and
objected to it demanded that Sena
tor Mayfield first be given due notice
of all the charges contained in or
der that he might be the better pre
pared to meet what is coming up and
that if any other charges are to be
KLAN MEETING IS FIRED
UPON AT LEBANON, KY.
Lebanon, Ky.—No arrests have
followed the attack made on an al
leged Klan meeting by aliens here on
the night of December 12 when ap
proximately r SO shots were fired at
the hall in which the meeting was
held and all the window lights
broken. In addition to the bullets,
•bricks and stones were hurled through
the air, many of them striking the
building and damaging it. No one
was seriously hurt.
The chief of police acted at once
to put down the riot and succeeded
in getting quiet restored before any
one was killed. There were about
250 hoodlums in the mob, many of
whom were stationed on the tops of
buildings surrounding the hall in
which the alleged Klan meeting was
being held. These men were chased
from their positions by officers.
Men known to be opposed to
American principles made their way
into the hall although the meeting
was strictly an invitational affair.
They were asked to leave, as it was
known that they were armed and
were looking for trouble. After a
few mintes’ talk they left and short
ly after the speaker began to ad
dress the meeting, the firing began.

righteousness today than to be the
greatest executive in America, be
cause the prophet occupies the place
of sovereignty.—Dr. James E. Free

made or any other thing trumped up
against him that he be promptly no
tified. This Senator Spencer prom
ised in the Senate he would do and
then all objection was withdrawn.
The resolution was then passed; it not
only authorizes the committee to go
ahead and make the investigation
complete, but appropriates money for
the necessary expenses of the com
mittee, the right to subpoena wit
nesses, hire stenographic help, send
for ballots and ballot boxes and gath
er any and all sorts of information in
connection with the case in the dis
cretion of the committee.
It was most gratifying to Senator
Mayfield and his friends to sit and
listen to the proceedings on the
floor of the Senate recently for it was
all sprung without warning and it
tended to show that the Texas sen
ator is not without friends in the
Senate. The way they rallied around
him in an effort to give him a square
deal was some sort of satisfaction to
a man who is about to face his ac
cusers in a contest. It also tends to
serve notice on every Tom, Dick and
Harry In the country who desires to
make charges against a United
States senator that they must play
the game in the open, put their cards
on the table face up and show their
hands without any effort at conceal
ment. If charges are to be made
against a senator the Senate insists
on knowing the exact nature of the
charges in detail and not in glitter
ing generalities.
To Meet in January
The subcommittee of the Senate
committee on privileges and elections
has been called to meet some time
in January for the purpose of begin
ning the hearings on the election con
test case of Senator Mayfield of
Texas. Chairman Spencer has just
sent out the call to the other mem
bers of the subcommittee who are, be
sides himself, Senators Ernst of Ken
tucky, Green of Vermont, Neeley of
West Virginia, and King of Utah.
The first day will most likely be
devoted to agreeing to the methods
of procedure and arranging same
with the attorneys on both sides of
the case. And each side will most
.ikely state to the committee the
charges as they are made, what Mr.
Peddy, Senator Mayfield’s opponent,
expects tj prove, etc.
KKK ORGANIZER CHASED

Dr. Hawkins and Wife Targets of
Shots Fired Over Twenty Miles
by Angry Pursuers
—K-K-K
Wilmington, Del.—Dr. J. H. Haw
kins, Klan organizer and represent
ative of the Imperial Palace, and his
wife arrived in Wilmington today
after being chased 20 miles by an
gry Klan opponents. The pursuing
party fired a score of shots at the
Hawkins motor car.
The chase followed a fight at Kim
bleville, near Westchester, Pa., where
Hawkins spoke.
Hawkins sharply criticised a re
ligious denomination which is op
posed by the Klan. Cries of “liar”
arose from the rear of the hall.
When members of the Klan made
efforts to quell the disturbance about
50 men left the hall, tearing the
doors from the hinges and hurling
bricks back through the doorway. A
fight ensued but Hawkins and his
wife hurried into a waiting automo
bile. They had just started to Wil
mington when they were attacked.

ANTI KLAN PAPER BUSTED
St. Louis, Mo.—Beams from the
St. Louis Star, bitter anti-Klan paper
of this city, no longer are to be cast
upon citizens of the Mound City.
Defeated in its two-year fight upon
the Ku Klux Klan, The Star is to
pass into the hands of the St. Louis
Times which, while not recognized as
a publication favorable to the Klan,
has at least, since newspapers
throughout the country started their
fight on the Klan, been fair to the or

That the Ku Klux Klan is fortu
nate in its present Imperial officers is
patent to everyone who will “read as
he runs.” When Imperial Wizard Dr.
H. W. Evans took over the reins of
leadership in November, 1922, the
organization was almost bankrupt.
Its assets were in reality far below
its liabilities. The first survey of
the body showed Dr. Evans that the
income was not keeping pace with the
outgo. Merely swapping dollar for
dollar, as it were.
Then it was that the Imperial Wiz
ard began to look for the leaks. And
he found them a-plenty. He imme
diately took proper lawful and legal
steps to make correction, and then
“Hell broke loose in Georgia.” Every
parasite that had been instrumental
in bleeding the Klan white was up in
arms because Dr. Evans refused to
be more than a rubber stamp, so to
speak. The Imperial Wizard can
celled contracts which, while appar
ently made in good faith by former
officials, were wholly inimical to the
welfare and prosperity of the Klan.
The inflow of thousands of dollars
were going into the pockets of indi
viduals and not into the exchequer of
the organization, as he rightly be
lieved. Personal gain appeared to be
the sole motive, and not the upbuild

ST. PAUL STUNG AGAIN, SISTINE CHOIR A FAKE
Anti-Klanners Fall All Over Them
selves To See and Hear Official
Vatican Choir Which Was Not
Official
We take this editorial from “Our
Sunday Visitor” Catholic publication
of Huntington, Ind., which has been
blessed and approved by the several
Popes:
“We are reading in different pa
pers of the advent of the Sistine
Choir in this country.
“While it is very likely that this
choir will give perfect satisfaction to
lovers of music, Rome would have it
understood that the choir is NOT the
Sistine Choir. The Papal delegate in
Washington recently declared: ‘The
so-called Sistine Choir is not author
ized to use that name, nor, is its
American tour authorized by the Holy
Father.’ ”
If this is not operating behind the
mask, we have lost our power of
reason. Advertisements appeared in
the daily press that the Sistine Choir
was direct from the Vatican and this
no doubt added quite a few dollars
to the funds. A great many daily
papers carried statements to the ef
fect that the choir was official but we
have yet to see one carrying news
that it was a fake.

AN6LO-SAXON KLAN IS
FORMED IN AUSTRALIA
—K-K-K
Is Patterned After Klan of United
* States, and Has Same Chris
tian Ideals
—K-K-K
Sydney, N. S. W.—The Anglo-
Saxon Clan of Australia was formed
recently, and is sweeping the coun
try. It is patterned after the Ku
Klux Klan of the United States, and
has Christianity for its main tenet.
Discussing the Clan, Captain Chap
lain J. C. Wilson said:
“We want no religious squabbles,
and we do not intend to make any
fight on the Roman Catholic Church
as a religious institution, but the Clan
will unalterably and unequivocally op
pose any move of the Catholic church,
or of any other church individual, or
organization which attempts to bring
about a combination of church and
state in Australia.
“No Jew will be admitted to the
Order, as the whole of its teachings
are those of Jesus Christ. It would
be unjust to allow the Jew to enter
when every meeting would be out of
harmony with his religious convic
tions.
“The Clan is not anti-labor, as is
proved by the fact that a large per
centage of the American Klan mem
bership is composed of union and
non-union elements of labor in all
parts of the United States; neither
is it anti-capital, unless capital should
become tyrannical in its attitude
toward the state or its people.”
Among the principles for which the
organization stands are:
“Suppression of graft by public
office holders; preventing the cause
of mob violence and lynching; sensi
ble and pariotic immigration laws;
separation of church and state; and
freedom of speech and press, a free
dom of such that does not strike at
or imperil our government or the
cherished institutions of our people.”
DAILY NEWSPAPER SITUATION OF
TWIN CITIES NO BETTER WITH
MINNESOTA “STAR” IN FIELD
WHY DO DAILY PAPERS
DEAL IN FALSEHOODS?
With a -wild outburst of joy, a
group of men set forth upon an ac
tivity which was supposed to result
in the establishment of a newspaper
which wouM fearlessly tell the truth,
pointing out emphatically that no
individuals or special interests would
be able to control the editorial pol
icy of this newspaper.
It was not strange, therefore, that
a large number of people in Minne
sota looked foi-ward to the appear
ance of an independent newspaper
which would dare ta publish the truth
and nothing but the truth. Many
people all over he state went down
into their jeans and purchased stock
in this proposed newspaper. Event
ually, the Minnesota “Star” appeared.
Its first issue was greeted with glee,
but as the days went by, even the
staunchest supporters of the enter
prise began to realize that the Min
nesota “Star” was as unfair as any
of the other metropolitan dailies in
the Twin Cities. Each day proves
conclusively that the Minnesota
“Star” does not intend to be a news
paper without bias. Minnesota jour
nalism was never more cursed than
when the “Star” appeared on the
scene? Robert M. LaFollette is re
ported to have made the statement,
during the Shipstead-Kellogg politi
cal battle, that, from what little he
had seen of the “Star”, he wished
that that daily would be as fair to
the other side as it is to its own
side. That clearly states the editor
ial situation in which the “Star” finds
itself.
So far as the Ku Klux Klan is con
cerned, the “Star” has been just as
malicious as any of the dailies of the
kept press. Recently, the “Star” came
out editorially re-emphasizing a
mess of lies, which point to the Ku
Klux Klan as the instigator of the
Mer Rouge murders. Surely the ed
itor of the “Star” knows the fa:ts.
He has revealed himself unfit to fil:
tne editorial chair of the “Star” thru
his deliberate distortion of facts par
tairing o the Mer Rouge affair. To
a man up a tree, it looks as if the
editor of the Minnesota “Star” is
more concerned about damning the
Klan than he is presenting the facts
relative to Klan matters. In this
he is not any different than the edi
tors of he metropolitan dailies of the
United States. He has tried to hang
the Mer Rouge affair on the Ku Klux
Klan, when investigations have
proved that the Klan is absolutely
innocent. By little evasive questions,
he makes an effort to give a sem
blance of truth to a deliberate false
hood. By so doing, he writes him
self down as a newspaper man who
lets fancies take the place of facts.
Bob Schuler, of Los Angeles, Is
the editor of Schuler’s Magazine,
one of the fairest and most fearless
of publications in the United States.
The Reverend Schuler is not a Klans
man, but, nevertheless, he is not
afraid to lay before the people—
facts. Dear Reader, we leave it to
you. The Minnesota “Star” said we
did—facts say we didn’t In order
to present the matter properly, we
shall retell the story of the Mer Rouge
murders, as it appeared in Schuler’s
Magazine for December. You can't
accuse Schuler’s Magazine of being
a Ku Klux publication, for it’s noth
ing of the kind. We present, as fol
lows, Bob Schuler’s article:
Something altogether new and
startling has appeared, hidden over
among the ads of the dailies. Dr.
John A. Langford and Dr. Charles
W. Duvall, unquestioned authorities
as pathologists of national reputation,
who conducted autopsies on the two
mutilated bodies that were supposed
to have been those of Watt Daniel and
T. F. Richards, of the “Mer Rouge
mystery,” have come forward with a
voluntary statement to the effect that
the bodies examined by them could
rot have been in the lake, from which
they were supposed to have been
taken, more than .forty-eight hours,
and that such was their verdict at the
time they examined the bodies.
The newspaper headlines are “New
Mystery in Mer Rouge Slaying,”
‘ Mystery Deepens in Louisiana Slay
ing,” “Added Mystery in Ku Klux
Tragedy,” etc. Quite mysterious,
this, isn’t it? The mystery to this
writer is that Governor Parker of
Louisiana and his fellow conspirators
are not speedily arrested, and this
dastardly “planting” of two bodies
m the lake near the Mer Rouge sift
ed to the bottom.
Months and months ago, this mag
azine announced the fact that it was
a scientific absurdity and a physical
.mpossibility for two bodies to re
main in that semi-tropical lake for
months and come out in the state of
preservation which characterized the
two bodies in question. I knew then
that those bodies were shipped into
Mer Rouge in trunks, having been
furnished by a medical school within
the state, and so stated.
But here comes the proof. And
one immediately wonders why the
statement of these two medical au
thorities failed to reach the public
when the sensation was on the front
page, under heads two inches to the
letter. Who saw to it that the ver
dict of these two gentlemen, promi
nent pathologists, never reached the
readers of the daily news? There
were more than a hundred reporters
on the grounds, mostly Roman Catho
lics, it is true, but reporters just the
same. Everybody was reading about
it, and excitement ran riot. How
does it happen that the proof of the
“planting’ of these two bodies is an
nounced months after the facts of
that “planting” were known to the
forces that were “pulling” the “frame
up” and their newspaper representa
tives?
Mystery, indeed! There may have
been a mystery, but there is no mys
tery left. This is the plainest thing
that sane men have been called up
on to face for many a day. It is now
as clear as the sunlight of noon. All
that story of two bodies weighted
down in the mud of a lagoon, fastened
with wires to some kind of torture
machine that had been used to break
their bones, inch by inch, and finally
blasted loose, tons of explosives hav
ing been used for the purpose—all
that story was and is 100 per cent
premeditated falsehood.
There is no doubt left in any sane
man’s mind but that the fiction pub
lished by way of propaganda all
over the nation was known to be fic
tion by the very newspapers them
selves at the time of publication. It
is unthinkable that these reporters
should have been unaware of the
fact that two such eminent authori
ties had declared it impossible for
these bodies to have remained in
those waters more than forty-eight
hours. That the whole thing was a
Roman conceived plot, deliberately
planned, a« Rome always plans her
great deceptions; that the “planting”
of these “stiffs” from the medical
school was deliberate and for the pur
pose of making possible a nation-wide
deception; that the Mer Rouge trag
edy was only a tragedy in that the
public was misled purposely in
wholesale fashion—that this is the
mystery and the only mystery is now
as clear as day.
Governor Parker deserves to spend
tne rest of his life in the state peni
tentiary for having headed such a
dastardly plot. His Romish confed
erates and cohorts deserve the con
tempt of *ll righteous, honorable and
just men for having stooped to such
a base and un-American campaign of
false propaganda. The daily papers
of the nation deserve the rebuke of
every man who holds the truth to be
worth while, for having permitted
their columns to be used by the plot
ting forces to thus deceive the peo
ple of America. Why should think
ing men ever again believe what they
read in the daily papers, following
this exposure, this statement of the
two great scientists who conducted
the autopsies, and announced then as
they announce now that those bodies
had been “planted” in the lake with
in forty-eight hours of their removal
therefrom.

irom whose bourn no traveler re

cheir remembrance expressed by a

Klansman Keith was a man of vi

former Mayor of St. Paul, Larry

che Fairmount Sentinel, which was
published in that newspaper on Mon

‘Editor Fairmount Sentinel:
Yesterday’s Sentinel just received,
brings me the sad news that Dave
Keith has passed into the Great
Silence.
Shocked and grieved as I am, my
first thought is one of deep and pro
found gratitude that I knew this
splendid man and felt the radiant
goodness of his loyal and unpreten
tious friendship.
It was wonderfully good to know
Dave Keith. He was a human man, a
kindly, generous, tolerant, helpfui,
man; a power for good in his com
munity; a citizen of broad and keen
vision, equipped to serve the public
need, and giving that service whole
heartedly without thought of reward.
No man ever called on him for help
in vain. He held himself at the com
mand of his fellows glad and eager
to be useful. He was uncomplaining
in the midst of life’s troubles and
perplexities. He took one day at a
time, gave his best, and lived above
worry and doubt. He never paraded
his virtues, never sought acclaim,
and was satisfied to live modestly,
humanly and without pretense.
To be Dave Keith was to feel that
life was a very worth while enter
prise, filled with warmth, jollity, gen
tility and goodness. To remember him
will always be an inspiration, a re
vival in the heart springs of gracious
and unfailing joy.
In the midst of his own sickness he
was always anxious about others;
and in his last days he visited several
friends who were ill, seeking to cheer
and comfort them.
Martin county will long remember
a citizen so sterling in character; and
all who knew him will treasure his
memory as one faithful in friendship
and beautiful in service.
His magic was not far to seek,
He was so human! Whether strong
or weak,
Far from his kind he neither sank
nor soared,
But sate an equal quest at every
board;
No beggar ever felt him condescend,
No prince presume; for still himself
he bare
At manhood’s simple level; and
where’er
He met a stranger, there he left a
friend.
