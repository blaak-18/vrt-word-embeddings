forgive that wicked scheme to rob the
country counties of their constitution
al share of political power, he then
changed his mind again. He not only
refuses to be bound by the rule of his
own committee, but returns to his old
position in favor of denying the Pops
the right to vote in the White Pri
mary. No Populist and no Democrat
is bound to vote for Bryan because
of the June primary. Bryan was not
in it all. The result of the primary
was that all who voted in it were
honor-bound to vote for Joseph M.
Brown, and the other statehouse nom
inees. Beyond this they were free to
vote as they pleased at “any future
election.’’ So reads the rule of the
Democratic Committee.
The November election is a “fu
ture election.”)
A WORD FROM OHIO.
Toledo, 0., Oct. 6, 1908.
Aly dear Mr. Watson: In reply to
enclosed card to my late son, who was
a subscriber to your paper and mag
azine, wish to say you may send your
publications to me, under your offer
direct to my home, Petersburg, Mich.,
check for amount enclosed herewith.
As to the political situation, it is
a. mixed state, changes all around. If
you could be here for one night it
would take like wild fire, but I know
it is more important for you to look
after your own state. I have given
out over 100 of your speeches of ac
ceptance. Enclosed find clippings
from “News-Bee” and “Times,” of
this city, showing where the
“Dems” are going. “Sherwood” is
Democratic candidate for Congress.
Fraternally,
JOHN 0. ZABEL.

Enid, Sept. 28, 1908.
Hon. Tom Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Allow me to assure you
of my sincere friendship and of my
vote for the highest position on earth.
And to explain for the benefit of oth
er free voters a few reasons for my
conviction that this is in the interest
of the people of the United States. I
mean all of the people, rich and poor,
black or white, male and female.
First. I believe you are honest and
sincere in all ydttr public utterances
and in the use of your vote and in
fluence on the disposition and settle
ment of public affairs.
And I believe that honesty in pub
lic life is the only safe policy for
this government, for the protection of
liberty and life as well as for prop
erty.
A dishonest or corrupt administra
tion of this government must inevita
bly result in contempt of law as well
as in contempt and hatred of the
authors and administrators thereof,
and this must be dangerous and de
structive of all the rights whiem we,
as free men, hold sacred. Allow me
to say that my opinion of you is
based upon a knowledge of your at
titude on all the issues that come be
fore the people and that you have in
variably proved by your actions, as
well as your words, that you are
free and clear of all connection,
either directly or indirectly, with the
conspirators of the Democratic and
the Republican parties. I will call <>n
the working men of every class to
examine your record, read your publi
cations and judge by evidence. Es
pecially do I call upon the farmers'
organizations to show their apprecia
tion of your interest and advocacy in
their behalf. They must know that
you have given them freely, without
money, and without price, promise,
or pledge,•'the benefit of your influ
ence and advice, and have given their
cause space and argument in your
publications that would have brought
you thousands and thousands of dol
lars as well as political and social
power, had you devoted them to the
cause of corruption and dishonesty.
I should be proud to see you swing
“dear old Georgia’s” electoral vote
this fall. If you should be elected
President of the ‘United States, I
should go with you to “march
through” any state of this Union
that should rebel against your law
ful authority, not even excepting my
native state, dear old lowa.
I believe now that, if the com
mon people understood the real is
sues that are before them, you
would carry every state in the Un
ion. If they knew that the Demo
cratic party, which is responsible pri
marily for surrendering the whole
legislative authority of the govern
ment to the supreme court (which
treason was afterward sanctioned by
a Republican administration), is now
asking the American people to rati
fy this rascally conspiracy of usurpa
tion, revolution and treason, I be
lieve they would rise up and hurl
from power every man who has been
participating in governmental affairs
since. What would Washington, Jef
ferson, Jackson, or Lincoln think if
they knew there is a proposition be
fore the American people to incrim
inate them by convicting them of col
lecting millions of dollars from the
people unlawfully and in violation of
the constitution of the United States?
Why is this not discussed in the cam
paign ?
Do not you think Justice White's
opinion would make a good campaign
document? If you will print a lot I
would be glad to circulate them. Do
you think it would make a good arti
cle for your magazine?
I received a circular from Demo
cratic headquarters, asking me to col
lect money for them. It recalled the
circumstance when I wrote to you
and Bryan and Roosevelt, asking for
a word of cheer and encouragement
to aid me in a farmers’ organization.
When I received a polite letter from
“private secretary” Cortelyou in
formed me that “it would not be
proper for Mr. Roosevelt to answer
such questions,” while Mr. Bryan ig
nored it in everything except to
adopt my plan to organize
his Commoner pledge club, but from
Mr. Watson came just what I asked
for, a ready, open, manly approval
both of my plan and its object.
Thank you for it; I have laid it
away with my children’s pictures,
and if I had a dollar in the world it
would /o, like my vote, to the gallant
Jittle Georgian.
Yohj’B fraternally,
JNO. B. STUART,

FROM AN OLD VET.
Fort Gaines, Ga., Oct. 5, 1908.
Dear Mr. Watson: . Personal in
juries by railroad, sickness and un
toward events have left me poor in
deed, but I enclose $1 for your na
tional campaign, as a freewill offer
ing of an “old Confederate.”
The recent outrages near the up
per James, in Buckingham county,
Va., have recalled to me the bravery
of your Uncle Billy. If he were alive
and back in that dear old state, he
would be the hero to smite the ban
dits and lead the charge upon their
rock walls. One such hero could
“chase a thousand, and two, put ten
thousand to flight” from their hid
ing places.
Cordially yours,
W. A. SCOTT.
Vidalia, Ga., Oct. 5, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Doubtless you will be
surprised at this communication, as
it is my first to you, but may not be
the last. I have been for you and the
cause you represent for a number of
years. I was instrumental in carry
ing Oconee county for the Populists
in 1894 (I think that the date) and
have been a true-blue ever since. I
know we have many a blow that
strikes below the belt, but neverthe
less, if we stand to the helm, some
day we may see victory written on the
front of a dazzling crown, the crown
that an honest body of people
have fought hard to win and which
thev deserve.
«•
We have quite a number of Popu
lists in Toombs county and I think
you will make a good score on elec
tion day.
With best wishes, I am vours in the
fight,
A. A. DARBY.
K. D. Strickland, Carlton, Ga.
I want the names of every Jeffer
sonian Democrat that will send you
$5 to be used in behalf of honest re
form. Inclosed yon will find a check
for $5 for that purpose. Brethren,
come along and go with me that far
and let’s encourage our grand and no
ble leader. It’s a shame for us to let
him do all of the work at his own ex
pense. If you have the confidence
in Mr. Watson’s honesty, ability and
purity of purpose that I have you
would feel no fear.
MR. WATSON AT MADISON.
Apalachee, Ga., Sept. 28, 1908.
R. F. D. 1.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson spoke at
Madison last Wednesday, the 23rd
instant, to a large audience composed
of the most intelligent men and wo
men from Morgan and adjacent coun
ties. His speech was well received
and enthusiastically applauded. There
was nothing acrimonious in its make
up, and nothing was said which the
Honorable Hoke, nor our friend, Billy
Bryan, could take exception to. It
was a clear presentation of facts as
they exist.
We believe that this speech was a
great vote maker, as we heard a great
many people remark, “I came here
expecting to vote for Bryan, but
since hearing Mr. Watson’s speech, I
shall vote for him.”
The only thing there is in the way
to keep nearly every one from accept
ing the Populist, or Jeffersonian, De
mocracy, doctrine and principles is
that those who are not of this belief
will not turn out to hear the doctrine
explained and expounded. “There
are none so blind as those who will
not see.”
We believe, however, that if our
leader, Honorable Tom Watson, keeps
“pegging away,” the people will
eventually imbibe this doctrine, and
true Jeffersonian Democracy will once
more be reinstated in this fair land of
ours. A. H. MALLORY.
Jersey City, N. J., Sept. 15, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: The indications are that
the old Democratic party is about
to be destroyed. You are fighting it
in the South, and Hearst in the North,
West and South. If the “solid
South” can be broken up, -this will
be the end of the Democratic party —
and we can then have national issues
discussed on their merits: We shall
not have to go back to ante-bellum
times and talk about negro slavery
and tariff for revenue only.
Sincerely yours,
JOHN S. DeHART.
TAFT OR’ BRYAN—MAKES BUT
LITTLE DIFFERENCE.
Bryan’s Mill, Texas, Sept. 23, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Another time for the
American people to show whether they
are wise or foolish is near at hand.
Only a little more than a month till
election day. I think they will clearly
demonstrate that the majority of
people are not capable of self-govern
ment, not wise enough to vote for
their own interests. It will be Taft
or Bryan. I am like Harriman —
“it makes but little difference.” The
power behind the throne is about the
same. The corporations will control
in either case.
Mr. Bryan doesn’t want (?) cor
porations to contribute anything to
his campaign fund, but asks individual
members thereof to send in Mheir
checks. This deception is so palpable
that a blind man can see it. And
then in each congressional district the
Bryan managers are calling for con
tributions of one dollar, or more, from
each voter. I predict the greatest
corruption fund in the history of this
or any other country, and many a
poor fellow that can’t have meat
three times a day will pay a dollar
to have the shackles riveted.
I wish to say, my dear Sir, that
while many here have “bowed the
knee to Baal” there are a few of us
that have not, nor will we ever. We,
as Texans, are proud of the Alamo,
and, politically, we will emulate their
example, and it may be our posterity
will reap the reward of our fidelity to
our country. I must say that you and
our principles are recently growing in
favor with the more intelligent here,
and I believe that if, by some means,
the dark clouds of ignorance through
prejudice could at once be rolled back,
you would be the next president. But
alas, the stupidity of humanity!
May the Lord bless you.
Fraternally and truly yours,
J. H. FROST.
