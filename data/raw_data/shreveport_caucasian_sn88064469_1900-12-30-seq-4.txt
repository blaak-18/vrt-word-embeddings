NOt AN IDLE BOAST..;
Preeldnt .Kruier made no Idle
boast wheu be said after the first blow
had been struck in the South African
war, that if Cnglaunl saould conquer
the Dutch Republicans it would be at
a price tuat would "stagger humtan
ity." Mr Broderick, under secretary
for war, in laying the preliminary
estim ites before 1'arlasin utt was
forced to talk in an apologetic way.
He had to c:nfess that tie South
Afric-n war, the cost of which at the
beginning, says the New Orleans
States, was reckoned as only $*S,000,
000, had already gone beyond *5'0,
000,000, and wbereas the jolly bd;i
lay mareh on to Pretoria was to
have been accomplished by 20,000
troops in addition to the bouth
African garrison', no less than 270,
000 men had to take tue field. Among
these the losses have b en appalling.
Under the return "killed or died of
wounds," there is z list of 11,000 IDee.
As "wounded," 13,000 are reported,
while 12,000 more are in hospitals in
"outh Africa, ili of typnoid lever and
other diseases.
Then there are 36,000 men who are
trouped under the head, "returned
to Eagland, sick, wounded, or died
on passage." in short, some 70,000
men killed, wounded, or disabled, in
order to give 24,000 On lauders a
five-years' trauchise, instead of a
seven years'! "Have we not seen the
war lever before ?" writes Kr Gold
win Smith. "Did we not see it at its
height at the tine of the Crimean war,
which is now universally condemued
and deplored? Even swifter nimut
come the condemnation of the South
African war, with its sacrifices
doubly fearful because needless."
England has already paid the price
which Oom Paul mentioned at the be
gfuntng of hostilities, but this is not
all. She is still payiuz and doubt tas
wi 1 continue to do so for months and
perhaps years to come if there shou d
be a general rebellion of the Dutch in
Uspe Colony. The war office In Lon
don is arranging to transport large
bodies of irregular mounted troops o
South Africa as reluforcsments for
General Kitchener, and of course this
means that more money will noe drain
ed out of the British treasury.
The would-be-but-ias-ot-Congr as.
man F M Welch, mayor of Alexan
oris, La., has been la Washington, D C,
tobnobbing with Marcus Augustus
Hanna in regard to his controln at
of the distribution of Federal patron
age in the fourth Congressional Dis
trict, but the Indications are that
Welsh is not the only pebble on the
Republican beach-there are others;
others with a stronger,. better and
