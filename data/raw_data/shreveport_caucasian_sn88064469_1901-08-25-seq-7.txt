CENTRAL AMERICAN WAR.
Qeanral Jefrises eleves Tha" the UItedS
bates heauld Step is as S Cuba.
New York, Aug. 3I.-G-eneal H. O.
Jeffries, second in command to General
Alban, is quoted by the Colon corre.
spondent of The Herald, as saying that
he believes President Castro will be
overthrown.
"There willbe nodeolaraties of war,"
General Jeffries said. "In 1894 when
President Zelayn of Nicaragua invaded
Honduras. There was no declaration of
war. There are no declarations of war
in these countries. There is neither
honor or respeot between one nation and
another.
"While affairs are quiet here now,
they may not remain so. Only small
bands of robbers and buashwaokers are
in the coauntry.
"Venezuela recently called General
Uribe-Uribe, intending to send him
into Colombia, but there will be no war
either through the machinations . of
President Oastro or those of others who
are abetting the Liberals.
"It is time the United States pat its
foot down and said 'stop.' The duty
now is here if it ever was in Ouba.
Nicaragua has sent here four expedi
tions. That republio is now supporting
for president of Costa Rica. a candidate
who has served four years in the state
prison of New York for counterfeiting.
I do not say that all Liberals are thieve,
bnt all thieves are Liberals.
"Since the Liberal governments have
ruled these countries have become
bankrupt. Nicaragua was previously
recognized by the world as an American
Switzerland and was in a flourishing
condition, owing nobody, owning rail
roads and ships, having a surplus and
with its exchange at 11. The exchange
is now at 900.
"Nicaragua, Ecnador and Veneszuela
are now in misery. The best people are
emigrants and are forced to floee for their
lives after being robbed of all by their
governments. The countries are now
in a stat6 of anarchy. Liberty they
translate into robbery and libertinism.
Nowonder Mme. Rolanl cried: 'Liberty,
how many crimunes are lommitted in thy
name.'
"There is no chance for the i olombi·
an rebels, as their victory can give no
security either to foreigners or to the
natives."

test against what ho characterizedl asan
unwarranted attack upon the supreme

marks were cut off by a point of order,
but his words were greeted with ap
plause in which a considerable minority
of the convention joined.
Mr. Littlefield reviewed the decisions
as handed down by the court and his
cjitjoism was severe. His conclusions
s to Porto Rice's statapgs briefly:
"'So far as thq bperation of the consti.
tution was concerned this territory was
to all legalinterikt and purposes a part
of the United State, It matters not
how the constitutbior reached the terri.
tory so far as this Qase 's oonoerned,
solong as it was there." ,Mr
Mr. Littlefield also discusnesed the thir.
teenth amendment to the constitation
as it has been construed by the supreme
court. At the conclusion of Mr. Little.
field's address Mr. Moses obtained the
floor and haadle4 Mr. Littlefeld's opin.
ion of the court's decision in a severe
manner, but point of order kept the as.
sociation from taking any action.
