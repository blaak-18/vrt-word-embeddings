J . Mr. Currie presented following peti
tion :
To the Honorable City Council of the
s City of Shreveport: Gentlemen-We the
, undersigned citizens and property own
ers of the West End subdivision of the
city of Shreveport. respectfully repre
s sent that some time since the Hebrew
e Orthodox Congregation of your Tity ap
D plied for a right to locate a cemetery on
- certain lots in West End subdivision.
e That we. at said time, filed our protest
to the same with your honorable body.
That said protest was not passed upon
at the time but was referred to a com
mittee for further action. That subse
e quently, without further hearing from
tti, and after several changes, you grant
-ed to parties the right to locate a ceme
Stery on lots i, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 7, 8 and 9 in
block 15 of said subdivision. They fur
ther show that said Hebrew Congrega
r tion has- begun to build a fence around
said lots preparatory' to using the same
r as a burial ground. They show that they
have and had already bought homes
around said block and moved there with
their families expecting to make it their
homes, long before they knew it would
ever be used as a cemetery: They show
that to establish a cemetery there would
not only endanger the health of the corn
munity, but would, to a great extent, de
tract from the comforts and values of
their property. They show that they are
willing to purchase said property and
nay fo rall expense the said congrega
tion has been to in putting a fence
around the sajme, at the same figures
they paid for the said lots and fence
Hence, we pray that your honorable
ody will give us an opportunity to be
heard on this matter, and after a calm
and due consideration 'graat a rehearing
in this matter, and repeal said grant.
We show that we are citizens of your
city, and as such are entitled to due con
sideration, ssuch as each of you would
like to have, if a burial grotund were
shbout to be established at your door.
Believing that you will give us relief
ha the premises and if necessary repeal
grant, we beg to subscribe, yours

ADVANCE MONEY SYSTEM
Direct Cause of Ball Players Jumping
Contracts-Shreveport Pirates.
The New Orleans States says: "Of all
the evils that have crept into base ball is
the one of advancing money to players
,n their services for the next season.
This is the main reason that there are
so many contract jumpers in tle profes
sion today and why hall players as a
class are looked upon as dishonest indi
viduals. In the base ball columns of ev
ery paper published in the country you
will see it published daily that Jack
Jones. Tom Smith or some other player
has jumped his contract with the Slow
town Club to play with another club of
some other league, and taht he had
drawn so much ad"ance money from the
local club.
"If no advance money had been given
to the player it is most probable that he
would never be guilty of contract jump
ing. In no other business but base ball
is money ever advanced to prospective
players. Horse owners never advance
money to their jockeys or trainers; such
a thing would not for an instant be tol
erated on the turf.
"Advance money is the bane of the life
of a base ball manager. There is but few
players now before the public who would
even think of doing business with a man
ager unless they knew just how much
advance they could get. If the amount
offered suits them they will sign, not
otherwise. Most of the players, as soon
as they get the 'advance' immediately
proceed to spend it in riotous living, do
ing harm to themsefves by their conduct
and being in no condition to render
good services to their employers. Some
of them, as soon as they get the ad
vance, proceed to look up another easy
,mark of a manager that they can bunco
out of more money, and they succeed in
a great many instances. When the time
for repoyting comes, it is found that the
player has signed more contracts than
one and has gotten money from each of
the club managers. Then comes a row as
to which club is to get the player. If it
is a minor league player the Board of
Arbitration of the Association of Minor
Leagues takes up the case, deciding
where the player is to go. Of course, this
takes time and expense, as both clubs try
to prove their claims to the player. The
club that secures the player gets back
the money that they paid the player,
agreeing to pay the other club the money
that they paid the player, which is to be
taken out of the player's salary when
earned. Often the player balks on these
terms and puts up a strenuous fight
about not paying the money, by refusing
to play ball at all, threatening to retire.
If the player happens to be a draw ing
:ard this h'as the desired effect, and the
;lub owners pay the amount and stand
the 'bunco.'
"If all the leagues get together on a
national agreement, which is most likely,
the advance money question should also
be settled. Under no circumstances
should advance money be paid to players
for services to be rendered in the future.
If such a rule is adopted, it will put an
end to contract jumping and doul;le
dealing by the players, and will save
thousands of dollars for every club own
er in the country."
SHREVEPORT PIRATES.
Manager Bob Gilkes has to date signed
the following players: Norcum, Hulse
man, Weikart, Beck, Prout, Keenan,
Graffius, Page'Fisher and Kuhn. He still
hopes to secure Persons and Stewart,
and has put in a claim for Pitcher "Ike"
Butler.
