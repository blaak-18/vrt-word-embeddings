the
Wednesday at about z o'clock in me
he moining Ernest and Alexis ma
Blaic made an attempt to esscape, roc
atiit ,frtunately it proved unsuccess- ray
iul. Sheriff Broussard's experience of
ijn handling desperate characters his
:nd his nerve and coolheadedness any
despolled the young murderers of thf
herhaps their liberty. It was a att
bold and reckless undertaking on cle
the part of the Blanc brothers, and
had:the sheriff not taken the neces- the
Lary precautions the result might de
have been of a deplorable nature. ire
Even if the prisoners had failed to Es
accomplish their escape the life of sci
the~sheriff or that of one of his aids fai
might have been lost. From the the
-beginning the sheriff has appre- go
jiended that the Blancs would, if of
given the slightest chance, make an ba
effort to escape. Their pretended it
-esignation to the decree of the to
law and their evident desire to im- br
pess their keepers with their will- br
ing submission to the inevitable
tonsequence of their crime, had
created a suspicion in the sheriff's
m-.ind that they were all the time
planning an escape. Their sus- an
picious demeanor caused the sheriff re
Ito take more than ordinary precau- at
tions, and while he always treated
them kindly he never gave them the
ghost of a show to escape. bi
As the jail s'being repaired and L
tonsiderable work must be done on L
the cells by the contractor it be- at
tame necessary to remove the in
Blanc brothers to another jail for r
safe - keeping, Sheriff Broussard tl:
tnade arrangements to take the A
prisoners to New Orleans on the ti
1:41 .train Wednesday morning. o0
At about I o'clock he went to the re
. il in company with M r. Aurelien ti
0 livier and Marshals McFaddin
and Himel to prepare the prisoners nr
for the trip. The Blancs c
occupy the first cell to the left of 0
the corridor. The prisoners have
access to the corridor only when
the cell door is unlocked and c
bpentd by some one who invari
ably pcrforms this work from the
outside of the steel cage. This
rule is always adhered to as a mea
Sure of safety. WVhen the sheriff a
arrived at the jail he placed two
new suits on a chair in the corridor
bpposite the cell of the Blancs.
fIe then got out of the cage locked
its main door and unlocked the door
leading to the young murderers'
cell, telling them to step in the F
corridor and dress with the new F
suits that he had purchased for r
them. It required only a few r
Ininutes for the prisoners to don i
their new garments. The clothes I
fitted Ernest, but they were too i
small for Alexis, who remarked
that he supposed they would do for E
. man who was going to be hanged.
When they were through dressing
they were requested to return to
their cell, which they did. Then
their cell door was locked, the main
door of the cage was opened and
Sheriff Broussard entered the corri
dor for the purpose of manacling
the prisoners. Deputy Mouton
who was outside of the cage,
threw open the cell door, leaving
ho separation between the cell
and.the corridor. As soon as this
was done, Alexis, who was the first
to walk from the cell into the corri
for where Shetiff Broussard was,
advanced on that officer as quick as
lightning, clinched him with , both
arms. Fortunately Sheriff Brous
sard, being a very active and strong
inan, succeeded to overpowdr his
assaillant. He whirled around and
held Alexis by the arms and at the
same time watched the movements
bf Ernest who had not yet shown
any desire to join in the tussle. At
this stiae Ernest stepped up and
discovering that the sheriff did not
have his pistol, beckonied his
brothef to give up as it would
be futile to try to escape with
but the Use of a" seapon.
-] uring the stufffe the shefiff told
the gentlan on the otitsid'e of the
T' age to keep the door shut and let
'fitm' baidle the prisobers. He
Oery correctly thought that to open
the dobo would give the murderers
0jis  what the) wanted-a chance to
_e e---d he held his own un
aided, however serious the experi
ment might have been. Fortunately
the sheriff had put his pistol away
before entering the cage. Had he 0
not done so it is safe to say that
the pistol would have done deadly
work had it fallen into the hands of
one of the prisoners. Sheriff
Broussard shackled the prisoners,
using the irons on two arms and
fastening their other arms by means
of a rope. They .were taken from
the jail to the Southern Pacific he
depot tied in this manner The nil
younger brother, Alexis, who made cr,
the assault on the sheriff, seemed pu
more like a wild beast than a hu- tal
man being. While in the sitting to
room at the depot he appeared to a
rave with anger, and was the picture no
of a raging madman. He spoke to mi
his brother in a low- tone of voice w
and from his actions it was evident na
f that he was contemplating another is
t attempt to escape, but he was too it
i closely watched. wi
I When the excitement was over in he
the jail and the cell of the mur
t derers was searched a large bar of r
iron was found in it. This is what p
Ernest was looking for during the th
f scuffle, but it is believed that he of
s failed to find it as it was too dark,
the candle light having suddenly wi
- gone out. However, the sheriff ishe
f of the opinion that Ernest. held the of
i bar, but he did not use it because of
I it was too Clark in the cage for him
e to distinguish the sheriff from his
- brother and might have struck his
- brother instead of the sheriff.

Judge J. G. Parkerson Writes mi
Tile Gazette that he is bo:
Not a Candidate. ch:
A sort of political what-is-it was em
held at the court-house Thursday
night. It was surely not a Demo
cratic assembly. It was not a Re
publican convention, for it is cer
tain its leading spirits would object
to such an appellation. Aside from
a few hirsute appendages there was
nothing populistic about it. It
might have been the congregated
e wisdom of an unknown and un
t named party. If it was, its history
r is short and its career checkered.
It is like John Randolph's mule, PO
with no pride of ancestry and no an
hope of posterity. It was of a ni
f spontaneous origin and The Gazette
predicts that its end will come with go
equal spontaniety. If the signs of "'
the.times count for aught the progeny no
of this strange convention will go ti
glimmering on the 3rd of May. It
will go to its grave unsung, un
honored and unwept. In no spirit th
of vengeance, but in the performance te
e of what it deems its duty The Ga
zette will do all in its power to Jo
hasten its demise, though it will ex- ca
s ert every effort to give it Chfistian th
burial. Rt
The meeting met in answer to a
E- call which stated that "All white
o voters and tax-payers of the town
d of Lafayette, who feel an interest in
tl its good government are urgently G
requested to meet at the court- at
house Thursday, March x I, at 7 T
o'clock p. m., for the purpose of cC
selecting a municipal ticket com- th
r posed of a mayor and seven w
ss councilmen to bd Submitted
d to the white voters of the
town at the next election of May,
1897, without regard to ring, clique T
or gang-rule." The call was signed by
' the following persons:

Pursuant to the foregoing call, x
of the meeting was called to order by n
I Mr.\Vm. Campbell. Before proceed- n
, ing further MIr. Campbell said that c
he wished to make a few remarks. h
1e He said two years ago he attended
to a mass meeting in the court-house. ,
ce At that meeting he proposed that t
r- primaries be held to nominate a
municipal ticket at which primaries
all white voters, regardless of party s
affiliations, would have been en
.ty titled to vote. But the majority t
or defeated this resolution, and tle
ng meeting nominated a ticket. Mr.
:a- Campbell said that he was appointed
[a- on the executive committee com
ix, posed of five members, four of
rs; whom would be sure to oppose him
er- in anything that he might propose.
1o A few days ago a member of that
is. committee wanted him to sign a
call for a meeting, but the call
having been written and filled out,
the date and place of meeting hav
- ing been agreed upon, all without his
ye- knowledge, he peremptorily de
clined to affix his signature to it.
me Mr. Campbell added that he would
e not have signed it anyhow. Had
consulted with his friends and had
all decided to meet this night when
red they would nominate a ticket which
would surely be elected. Mr.
Ing Campbell was liberally applauded.
esr Mr. Campbell called upon Jno.
of O. Mouton to preside and H. Van
dercruyssen nominated Henry
red Gerac for secretary. Both gentle
om men were elected and took seats
it's at the desk used by the clerk of
court.
nc. On motion of Mr. Campbell the
nie chairman appointed the following
committee on resolutiohs: iVm.
si Campbell, DI)r. F. E. Girard, Felix
ddSalles, H. Vandercruyssen, E. T.
SMcBride. This committee retired
Sand immediately returned with a
an, set of resolutions which were read
Sby Mr. Campbell. The resolutions
S. proclaimed that the municipal gov
F ernment should be non-political.
SThe disinterestedness and the de
sire of this meeting to give the
n town good government and to wipe
edy out ring rule is enough to make a
ter- plantation mule hysterical and weep
the balance of his days.
The resolutions were adopted.
Ioes Upon Mir. Campbell's motion a
ros. committee ot rive was appointed to
select a ticket. The president ap
pointed the following: Dr. Gladu,
Leopold Lacoste, Charles Lusted,
P. C:hrouchet, A. R. Lisbony. Jud
The committee retired and a r
few minutes later filed in one by
one. Mr. Crouchet held the paper
and handed it to the president, and To ti
with the other members of the corn
mittee he took a seat in the jury I
box. Mr. Jno. 0. Mouton, the *as
chairman, arose and with the sol- whi
emnity befitting the occasion, read ing
the verdict. It was as follows: due

J. P. Revillon,
M. Rosenfield,
Chas. H. Lusted, A
John 0. Mouton, gist

Louis Lacoste.
The president moved that the re- this
port of the committee be adopted is
and the gentlemen be nominated. Car
It went through like greased light- Ari
ning. The president evidently for- Dis
got that he was presiding over the
meeting and that he was one of the it;
nominees. Had he thought of this for
he might not have made that mo- I c,
tion. Dr.
Some one in the audience made a
motion to adjourn. The president sun
thanked those present for their at- an
tendance and put the motion to ad- for
journ before the meeting. It was dad
carried and the crowd dispersed. dis
It is safe to say that a majority of I
the participants in the meeting are
a Republicans.
