THE ADVERTISER AND
THE BOSSES.
The Advertiser comes back at us,
not with any argument to sus:ain its
untenable position, but it sings its
favorite little song about those hor
rid "dictators," an:d then attempts
to put words into our mouth that
.everybody who has read our article
and tnde stands English knows we
have never uttered. Before pro
ceeding any further in this rather
premature discussion we wish to
state that The Gazette has aever
said or inferred that the .inti-ad
ministration committee oir faction is
trying to lead the white people as it
•would lead negroes. We trust that
our contemporary has not intention
ally misquoted our.article, and do
hot believe him guilty of such un
fairness.
The Gazette did say, however,
thirt in making the assertion that
two or three meners were running
the politics of this parish, our es
teemed friend unwittingly insulted
the white voters, for were they
guilty of being led and controlled
in the manner implied, they would
not be entitled to enjoy the sacred
privileges accorded to freemen.
Men who have Caucasian blood
running in their veins do not, as a
rule, submit to masters. This, our
friend should know full well. When
he spoke of mereurs probably he
had his mind fixed on those dark
days when the negroes were herded
like cattle to fight against decency
and respectability.
During those troublous times the
mess-ar was in the heyday of his
glory, but since Mr. Sambo has
heeded the counsels of his superiors
and taken a back seat the mesneur's
occupation is gone. The Gazette I
also casually reroarl:ed t at when t
The Advertiser said that the politi- t
cal affairs of tl-.is parish were con- I
trolled by "two or three dictators"
it necessarily implied that the white I
voters were Ili.dly led by the I
nose, in the same way as the docile c
lamb is led to slaughter. "Thi- Ga- I
Lette retorted that the white people
were not such moral cowa:ds and s
blooming gumps as to permit two a
or three menncurs- to lead them like.?
dumb brutes. Bul'. The Gazette has r
not, does not and will never cor
pare the followers of the Falk's hall
commilttee to negroes, for the P
gentlemen of that organ:ization
are, as a rule, good men who have v
a perfect right to organize as much
a; they see fit and to vote against
whomever they choose.
N;To, gentle Vandy; the meneur's
occupation, like that of Othello, is
gone.
The nmeneurs, themselves, are
considerably reduced in numbers,
for some have left for more congen
ial climes to the sweet tune of Annie
-Laurie while others remained at
home in inoccuous retiremelit.
Sometimes the plaintive voice of
one is heard, and for what I tor re
form! lie is a dead-game reformer
-ho would reform everything and
everybody except himself. In re
-lity he ic instinctively opposed to
anything that smacks of genuine re
faornt. He bears an iborn hatred b
to the very idea of reform and he p
would rather turn up his toes to the ti
daises than appear in the role of st
real reformer.
If The Advertiser is sincere in its b
antipathy to "'bosses" it will withi- lI
draw its support from the Falk's w
hall committee for within that fa
doubtful body are some esteemed m
;gentlemen who have a vast amount gi
of practical experience in that line
of business, or
While on the subject of ,.bos- h:
sisnm" we might remind ourf confrere th
that the people of this town and ar
parish were given a most striking etC
Inlustration of what The Advertiser sa
~wuld name "bossism." And is
a that case it should be still the b!
-nor~ objectionable to the good tc
_Demdrat. It was "bossism" of a
concededly Republican source, at- tin
tempted on a Democratic conven-ij
Tly evident on that fateful day ,

mae sineetrl7 sorry for the readers
'a jof that paper, he would indee4 be
a heartless villain who would de
prive our good friend of that pleas
ure. He is entitled to tell his little
tale as often as given an opportu
nity. It is an absolutely harmless
pastime and he should have his fun
just as well as other folks.

is, MR. LAIVE AND PRICES.
its Mr. Hector D. Lane, president
ts of the American Cotton Growers'
ar- Association, has, st> far, proven
ts himself to be a sagacious and wise
at leader. He has already given evi
,le dence of a tihorough knowledge of
re the causes of the ii:ctuations of the
o. cotton market. He is always con
er servative and his estimates can not
to fail to command the respect of both
rr the cotton farmer and the buyer.
d. vl r. Lane has recently issued an
is address to the farmiers that cotton
it will go a good deal higher than it is
at at present, and that they must not
ý. sell their crops at the actual figures,
to 8j3 and 8,, but he advises them
ii to wait until they are offered aso3
r, size of the crop and the demands
at for the staple, Mr. L.ane has come
Ig to the conclusion that if the farmers'
s_ insist upon tireir rights the price
d will inevitably go up to those
y figures. It is principally upon the
d fact that the demand for cot
d ton this year will be unusually
d great that he bases his opinion.
r. Mr. Lane also believes that the size
d of the crop will be much smaller
a than generally expected. This
Ishortage will sut ely result in an in
n crease of the price.
e Mr. Lane speaks in a way that
k inspires confidence. He appears to
d be convinced t:'at the fleecy staple
y will doubtless be very much in de
mand and that farmers will realize
e no less than roft cents per pound
s for it. The question is how long
s will they -.ave to wait, and how
s many are in a position to wait
s In this parish, for instance, few of
i the co: on . growers are heavily itt
debted, but they are iun"ed scarce
those w,.o aro aole to live much
longer without selling t eir crops,
and it is not probable that our
farmers are not as well off as their
brothers of other sections. On the
contrary, we believe they are far
- mnore prosperous. Ncvertieless, it
is devoutly to be wished that the I
Ssorely-tried cotton-farier will be in
'a position to follow th " advice of
Mr. Lane and await the expected
rise in the price of cotron.

g tences of the editor of The I,:.!!eti i

his grievances as follows: 'la t
,f brief, the edit:,r of i'ie B.,iil ini
held office under dte.ucr.':.c ad
e ministrations, which he now de
nounces as irnfamou::, from 182 to
1892. Doa ing that period he was

r and a suippliant for the support of t
e the gentlemen wihomf he has since
r taken so much plea ute in denounc
t ang as ",ballot box sttuffers a,,d ne
Sgro heriders.' Having -onv;rccl
himself that the democratic l-arty
f would not again honor him with an
I official position, he has turned 're
former.' "
Colonel Robert C. iangersoll, in
an aihlrc-ss befo:e t:.e New York
State H.ir Associ:.jion, said: "'As
long as c, il!ren a re raised in tene
ment anl g.ter.us. Lie prisons will
be full; tihe gulf between the richi
and poor will grow wider. One
will depend on cunning, the otherl
on force. It is a great question
w..eth:er tiose w,.o live in luxury
cari afford to allow others to exist
in want. T.,e value of property
depenrls, not on tne prosperity of
t:re few, but on the prosperity of a
very large majority. Life and prop
erty must be secure. ,r that subtile
thing called -value' ta es its leave.
'he poverty of the many is a per
petual menace. If we expect a
prosperous and peaceful country,
the citizens must have homes. The
mInore homes, the more patriots, the
mnore security for all that gives
worth to life. The more real edu
cation the less crime, and the more
homes the fewer prisons."
The children who are too poor to
buy s..oes can not attend the public
scihools in New Orleans. The un
fortunate bare-footed boy must not
enter the school house; he is not
wanted there, though it mi.:ht ap
pear strange to many people who
believe that the public s hool is,
first of all, the place where the
child of the poor may be taught
how to read and write. To the
strict disciplinarian it may look all
right to shut out the poor little fel
low because his parents can not
provide him with foot-gear, but to
right-minded people it is a ra,k in
justice, if not heartless cruelty.
All honor to The City Item for its
donation of shoes to the poor chil
dren, thereby enabling tizem to re
ceive the tpriceless boon of an edu
cation which should be given to
every child born under the stars
and stripes, however humble arndt
poor it may be.
