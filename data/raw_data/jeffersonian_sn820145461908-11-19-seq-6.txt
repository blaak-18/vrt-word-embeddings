ZETTEKS THE PEOPLE
POPULISTS ELATED.
Reidsville, Ga., Nov. 4, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My dear Sir: The Populists of
this section are so elated over the re
sults of yesterday that I shall write,
not to express my sentiments only,
but those of the “Old Guard” who
live around this place that was once
the hot-bed of the ‘ 1 Moss Back Dem
ocrats” of the county.
In former days the excitement at
this place was intense. The Demo
crats would rally around the polls <with
much enthusiasm, but yesterday the
workers, for some reason, folded
their hands, and the interest of other
days gave way to “the lull of a hot
summer’s evening.” And “we”
knew why. There had been a teach
er abroad in our noble state, a fear
less one, one who has taught so long,
at such a sacrifice, for the great mass
es of the people, that his voice is be
ginning to be heard; one who has
loved the people and proved his love
by sowing the seeds of political light.
This man who has gone forth like an
angel of light bearing the lamp of
Truth in his hand until, even now,
the clouds of ignorance begin to draw
back as the people refuse to be the
blind servants of one party; the un
tiring energy that has enabled a true
patriot, under the liars’ keen lash and
while “the oil of vitriol” was
being poured in the fresh wounds of
the conflict by friends and foe alike,
to advocate the principles of Jeffer
sonian Democracy, is at last to be re
warded.
The Populists got 36 votes here yes
terday. Some Democrats for the first
time in their lives voted for you.
Fresh from this victory of yesterday
we never felt as confident of ulti
mate success or as much like pinning
our faith to your*banner and contin
uing our battle until we of the South
receive some recognition politically.
I am so thankful for a Populist
father that trained me up in the way
I should go, and who has re
mained true to you from the very
first, his faith not wavering in the
least while I, for a short time,
thought you wrong in not supporting
Hoke Smith. We both sent you a
modest contribution for your cam
paign fund.
And had it not been for the pres
sure resting upon me as a young law
yer newly married, and trying to
make a start during a panic, I would
have given you very freely of my
time, money and talent. And one of
the greatest pleasures that I look for
ward to is the fact that I may some
time be able to be a true friend to the
people.
Pardon this long letter. But it is
a great pleasure that we, the people,
have a man whom we feel free to
write to.
Trusting that Georgia will be our
state when the truth is known as to
the election of yesterday, and that
you may live long to lead Us to
the right, I am,
Your sincere admirer,
S. B. McCall.
CARRIED THE COUNTY.
Wrightsville, Ga., Nov. 6, 1908.
Dear Tom: Johnson county went
for you by 136 plurality. The vote
■was very light all over the county, the
people not taking much interest in
it. Many white men of good repute
openly voted for Taft, a thing I nev
er knew to happen before, and right
here in a Georgia county, the Repub
lican candidate injured your vote.
You were hurt in Johnson county
more by Taft .than Bryan was. Men
would say, “If Tom Watson cannot
get it, I will vote for Taft.” I ex
pected you to carry the county by
300, but for the reason I stated and
the light vote polled, you failed to
get it.
However, you carried the county.
Wrightsville and Spann Districts
gave Watson 150, Taft 98, Bryan 137,
you beating Bryan 13 votes in that
district, but the papers put it that
you only carried Johnson county by
13 votes. There were 8 districts be
sides them.
You carried the county by 136, and
if the Pops had thought you could
have won, you would have got three
fourths of Taft’s vote, for very few
negroes in the county voted.
Many Watson men voted for Taft.
They would not go for Bryan and
they thought you could not win, so
they voted for Taft. I think Bryan
had better quit and go to the United
States Senate as a Senator from Ne
braska, if he can get there. He lacks
stability of character in regard to
his political policies and a lack of
that quality destroys confidence.
No doubt it was a great disap
pointment to a man of his great ambi
tion, but then, such is life and we
■have to make the best of things.
What was the size of the total vote
in Georgia? My friend, I certainly
took pleasure in casting my ballot for
you, and had it been in my power,
you would have gone to the White
House on March 4, 1909.
Write me full particulars about
matters. Yours,
S. W. Thomas.
DEMOCRATIC IDOL CRUSHED.
Thomaston, Ga., Nov. 6, 1908.
Dear Mr. Watson:
The election is over and when the
smoke of battle clears away the slain
of the enemy will be many and the
effects will be noteworthy. You have
crushed the democratic idol —Party—■
and scattered the idolater and they
don’t know where they are at. The
vote indicates to my mind that the
republican voters who have hereto
fore affiliated with the democratic
party South, will join their own par
ty, where they should have been 30
years ago, and that will give real
democrats an opportunity to re-align
themselves, and we will then have a
party of genuine democratic princi
ples. I see more than I can tell —see
it as “trees walking.” In Upson
there was about half a vote. In our
strong Populist precincts, not half
voted, and yet you cannot turn them
from their principles—seem just to
be completely pome
"Gb® 'Seffersonian
democrats came across and voted all
right. Some about town did not vote
at all, nor did they try to influence
any one else, that means something.
Our boys are ready for the fray when
you blow your horn. I believe you
were born for and inspired to be our
Moses in the political world, or you
could not have held out as you have.
My prayers have been behind you.
Yours truly,
B. F. Lee.
COUNTING US OUT.
Columbus, Ga., Nov. 3, 1908.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson,
Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I have just voted. My
number ought to be 180. My dear sir,
I don’t know the legal authority
regarding elections, but I know that
we have Bible authority to vote as
we choose. When my ticket was giv
en to Mr. Bob Grayes, who stood at
the ballot box and received the tick
ets, my ticket did not go straight into
the slot in the top of the box. He
raised up the lid of the box, and I
am quite sure my ticket is not in the
box. He has done eeveral men the
same way. It was reported to Mr.
Cecil Neal, the chairman of the dem
ocratic party. He said that he did
not know the law on one not having
the lid closed on the ballot box, and
that Mr. Bob Grayes was under oath.
My dear brothers, they are counting
us out here, just as sure as the good
God is on his throne. We ought to,
and will, rightly poll several hundred
votes. My dear brothers, I feel it
my duty to let you know just how the
thing is going. May the good God
bless you in your noble work. You
shall have my prayers to this end. I
am glad Mr. J. L. Coxey came. We
had a good crowd and his speech
took well. See the Inquirer and Sun,
our morning paper, of the third inst.
Yours truly,
Populist.
WILL ORGANIZE CLUBS.
«
Apalachee, Ga., Nov. 5, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My dear Sir: Your circular letter
received. I will do my best as your
agent. Os course, I haven’t much
time to devote to it, but I will get .
all the subscribers I can.
I have, been suffering a great deal
of late from a cancerous growth on
my face, and was compelled to go
to a specialist at Stone Mountain for
treatment. I think, however, the
worst is over; hope so, at least.
While at Stone Mountain I found a
regular “hotbed” of Populists.
More than half of those I met were
Populists.
I do not know whether a Populist
Club could be organized or not. I
believe that the “agonized” democ
racy is as “dead as a door nail.”
Surely, the old ship will sink clear
out of sight now. I don’t see how
they ever will “take heart” to try
to resurrect her again.
With best wishes, I remain, your
true friend,
A. H. Mallory.
P. S—J can try to organize a club,
WAS BRYAN EVER A POPULIST?
Can .you tell me if William J
Bryan was ever a Populist or spoke
in their behalf in any campaign?
J. R. S.
No to both questions.
Salem, Ga., Oct. 26, 1908.
Editor Jeffersonian:
What do you think of the enclosed
clipping from the Times-Dispatch of
Richmond, Va. ? In 1896 the Times
(later bought Dispatch) called W. J.
Bryan a Populist. I wrote them to
day if they were right then or now,
and referred J. R. S. to T. E. Wat
son, or W. J. Bryan, but assured
them that the latter would not reply
till after November, 1908, as the
truth might cost him a few gold
Democratic votes. He need not ex
pect many of them, as they will either
vote for Taft or remain at home.
W. H. Tinsley.
ROBBED OF OUR VOTES.
Columbus, Ga., Nov. 3, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson.
My Dear Sir: We are being robbed
here of our votes. We are expecting
this, Muscogee county, to be doubtful,
but the election managers have an
open box, and whenever there is a
ballot cast for any one outside of the
grand old Democratic party, the lid
of the box is raised and said ballot
is thrown out. Advise me what to
do. I will get fifteen or twenty peo
pleto swear to this. We are lacking
$lO to fill out our campaign funds
here.
Yours respectfully, Populist.
FURTHER COMPLAINTS.
Cairo, Grady Co., Nov. 3, 1908.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson.
Dear Sir: I write you this short
letter to let you know how the Demo
crats did us about election. I went
to my precinct to vote. The election
papers were all sent out to the pre
cinct, and there were no officers to
open the election in our precinct;;
nearly all were for you is why,
I think, it happened that way, and
if there is any law I want you to
attend to them nicely for treating us
like they have.
Yours truly, '
J. Bentley.
