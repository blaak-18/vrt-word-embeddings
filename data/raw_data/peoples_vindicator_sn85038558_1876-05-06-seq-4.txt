most popular humorists and satirists of
the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the established hmnnorous and
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as a
monthly, then, to satisfy the demand of
the pnlublic, it was changedl to a fortnight.
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting fidly as it flies, and showing up I
the political and social shams by its
masterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater success than
before, and was recognized as tn ablest
and brightest of its cass. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Outs
weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
ag the first snccessful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Anmong the artists especially engaged
to furnish illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Belieow, Thomas Worth Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels,
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to fame.
In its literary departments Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and I
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without.fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fas
tidious.

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada nmoun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR BIT
rans t" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of Vix
so0a Brrsas in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonie,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the river and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.

Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to Dxi. J. WALKER'S VISEGAIt

the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
