A Letter to the Father of a Young
Lady Missionary
(The nature of this gentleman’s
letter may be inferred from the fol
lowing answer to it.)
My Dear Sir:—Your favor receiv
ed. As a gentleman, I, of course, sin
cerely regret that anything which was
published in The Jeffersonian hurt
your feelings, or those of any member
of your family.
Your daughter’s name appeared in
your home paper, from which I took
it. No disrespectful reference to her
was intended. She having become a
foreign missionary, has assumed a
quasi-public character; consequent
ly is was perfectly legitimate to dis
cuss her choice of lifework.
As perhaps you know, I have been
very earnestly and persistently try
ing to impress upon our people the
necessity for a return to the Pauline
mission method—that is, the simple
preaching of the gospel and the or
ganization of churches which in
themselves would become proselyt
ing centers. In the time of the apos
tles, each church which they organ
ized became the nucleus of other
churches.
It is more than probable that
those who worked and talked with
Christ, and heard from His own lips
His instructions about what the mis
sionary was to do, understood our
Master better than such men as Bish
op Bashford and Dr. Burrows? IF
THE PAULINE SYSTEM WAS
WRONG, WHY DID IT TAKE THE
MISSIONARIES EIGHTEEN HUN
DRED YEARS TO FIND IT OUT?
England was not converted to
Christ as we are trying to convert
China; Ireland was not won to the
Cross by the way which we are now
trying to win Japan; Europe was not
added to Christendom by the meth
ods which we are applying to India.
All of the mighty triumphs of the
Cross —those triumphs which were
miraculous and which are today the
wonder of historians—were the re
sults of the Pauline methods. Peter,
James, John, Paul, Barnabas, Timo
thy, certainly understood their busi
ness. They went as heralds, pro
claiming Christ and Him crucified.
They explained the gospel plan of sal
vation. They were inspired by the
apostolic zeal which had no thought
of anything but the regenerated
heart, which was, in turn, to become
a worker for Christ. Armed with
nothing but the word of God, these
early apostles are found going
throughout the Roman, Grecian and
barbaric worlds, arousing conviction
in the hearts of people, and convert
ing them by doing just what Christ
told them to do — explaining to the
Gentiles just what Christ had ex
plained to those Hebrew’s.
Within the last fifty years, the
missionaries have departed from the
old Pauline standard. What new
light did they have on the subject?
My dear sir, think of it as a business
proposition. Is it likely that Dr.
Lansing Burrows (the Baptist) and
Bishop Candler (the Methodist) un
derstand Christ any better than those
who looked into his eyes and watched
His lips as He gave them His march
ing orders? I think your own com
mon sense will dictate the answer,
“No! a thousand times, no!” Those
Ghe Jeffersonian
original apostles who moved and
worked and talked in the very atmos
phere with Christ —some of them
eating with Him every day, and some
of them, doubtless, sleeping with
Him in the same room every night—
those are the men who must have
got His true meaning. At any rate,
the marvelous spread of the new gos
pel by the Pauline method is over
whelming proof of the merit, the
divinity, the miraculous power of
that plan. The fact that no change
was made in it until it had existed
for nearly eighteen hundred and fifty
years, is presumptive evidence of the
most convincing character that that
way of doing the work was the right
way.
I have never said or written a
word agaiinst foreign missions. I
bow my head obediently to the com
mand, “Go ye, and preach the word!”
But I don’t believe that we ought to
take the bread out of the mouths of
our own children and carry it to the
children of the Chinese. I don’t be
lieve we ought to leave learning a
sealed book to our own children and
open it to the Japanese. I don’t be
lieve we ought to desert the sick man
and the sick woman, to suffer and die
like homeless dogs all over Christian
America, while we erect up-to-date
dispensaries and hospitals in heathen
lands.
Suppose that one of our poor men
of your own county—a man who de
pended upon his daily work for his
daily bread, and whose wife and little
children are dependent upon that la
bor for their own support—suddenly
dies and leaves that wife and chil
dren without natural protectors, and
without a source of livelihood. What
is that widow to do? What are those
children to do? My dear Mr.
fhey do do. They drift off to
the city; and the mother and
the little brood go into the factories,
where the moral atmosphere is so
bad, and where the work is done
under such conditions as make physi
cal, mental and spiritual welfare al
most incompatible with that kind of
life. Either she does that, or she
does something worse. It is happen
ing all over our Christian land.
These homeless widows, these father
less and destitute children are crying
to us from Maine to California, from
the Lakes to the Gulf, and we harden
our hearts to these of our own flesh
and blood, while we go off to China,
Korea and Japan to erect magnificent
homes for destitute widows, and
sumptuous orphanages for heathen
children! Is it right? Is it natural?
Is it just? Did not Christ command
us to provide for our own household?
Are not the little American children,
are not the American widows, are
not the American maimed, old, dis
eased, blind and homeless, worth car
ing for?
Think of the illiteracy in our State,
my dear sir. Think of the illiteracy
that shames and degrades the entire
South. Think of the irreligion that
you can find in your own country, and
which I can find in my own town!
Think of the acknowledged fact that
not more than one-third of our peo
