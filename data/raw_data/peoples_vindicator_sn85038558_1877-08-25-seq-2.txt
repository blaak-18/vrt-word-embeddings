MUSCLE VS. CA PITAL.
Democracy the Peace Maker !
Never in the history of man
was there such an opportunity for
the display of brains than there
is to-day in America. We mean
of course, patriotic brains, "big
brains," as it were, at that.
We find at the end of a bitter
faction fight of sixteen years dn
ration our country torn, cominer
cially, financially and industrally,
into shreds and patches; amidst
the din of crashing corporations,
npturned banks and moans for
bread, we hear the shriek of the
howling demagogue advocating a
continuance of the effect, or at
least demanding legislation to
that end, without a movement to
remove the cause for all the evils
wwhich are now prostrating us to
the very dust. The ship pounds
on the breakers, the storm howls
astern, while incompetent Cap
tains fume and filss upon the deck,
demanding more steam to "drive
her ahead !"
It seems to us, weak country
mail as we are, that something
better call come of America in the
shape of statesmen than the rant
ers who now din the public ear in
all this storm with their frantic
idiotcy. It looks to us that true
men should study more the mo
tives of the turners, andi that they
should see that the doctor who
physiced the patient nigh to death
is little qualified to restore him
by an opposite treatment to sound
health.
Let us look at the causes which
brought about the present pros
tration of the country, and finding
theta, let us remove them at once,
and effect will cease.
America has three branches of
INDUSTRY which need the pro
tecting care of government; ag.
ricultural, manufacturing a n d
commercial. Legislation for the
one will be to the detriment of the
others, and all three are essential
to our prosperty, while two of
them are founded and flourish
upon the success of one, agricul.
ture. This is the industry which
ras anngua 2.s¢ iA td +ls asncel
of the country, and will do so
with profit to that muscle when
the manufacturing and commer
cial interests no longer require
labor as an adjunct. America
could exist and subsist without
manufactories or merchants, but
she and her people would perish
without farms. Stiml they are all
necessary to the happiness, coin
fort and wealth of a people.
Understanding this, how has
the Republican party legislated
in order to encoutrage these indus
tries; to balance them evenly I
A glance at their statutes will
give the answer.
Mannfacturers and capitalists,
have been the favored few in Re
publican legislation, and nio man
will deny it. Railroads, ship lines,
sea jetties, canals and docks, bris
tle at every step as the evidence
of governmental care over pet
commerce. A grinding tariff on
4000articles of consumption mark,
as with a monument, Republican
gratitude to its manufactories;
while National banks and untaxed
bonds flourish as the strong box
for thie declining years ofthose ple
thoric-pocketed sailers of ships c
and weavers of cloth. -All sprung
from the legislation of Republi-t
cans in the interest of those in
dustries it would still persist in
protecting to the detriment of the
one, the basis of all.
The cause of prostration is ap
parent; not because confidence is
lost, but because no avenue of in- s
vestment equal to the surety of a n
governmeent bond or a government
Kationalbank exists, nor can ever
exist, because the whole power oft
the government is exerted to sue.
tain them even to the ruin of all
eIse.
The muscle of the country, driv- lE
en at last to arms for succor, is tl
enunciating principles as detri. S
mental to the interest of the en- tl
tire country we admit, as mann- R
fictnre and capital are straining i
every nerve to sustain. Ohio and
her workingmen's communistic
platfonnrm agrivate evils, and their tl
dogmas, put in faith and practice,
will result as disastrously as the
vicious legislation of the Republi.
eah era has. Bat why shouldla
ranting Republican demagogues, i
ar Demllocratic ones forb that. a.
ter, express holy horror that Inns
cle should demanllld work irotil the
National govellnmellnlt.
If this government can enact a tariff
to protect Mlr. Sprague's prints, or
r. 1Mr. Sile one else's woolens-if the
government, ill other words, can keep
out conmpetition anil allow the woolen,
cotton and iron mills to charge us
what tlhey please, antd make us pay
it, for their goods ; if the government
a i builds up Banks, that men with three
for hundred thousand dollars in United
re States currency, the poor man's mon
cy, may go to one window of the
Treasury department and put that
money from circulation by bliying a
$300,0(0(H unta.ed Bond which will pay
ter them - per cent interest, and to anoth
In- er window and shore in the same
r- IBond as seem ity of $270,000 in Na
ly, tional Bank Notes to operate on in
Ist the purchase O f more National cur
rency to enter the never ending mill.
If this legislation, we say, can be
done in the interest of manufacturers
le and capitalist, why cannot the muscle
Sa Iemand, aye enforce, legislation for
at its particular agrandizeiient. There
to is no difference on princille betrceeni
to them !
ils The one is wrong and so is the oth
to er, and where is tihe remedy ?
hs Is it in the issue of more or less
vIs greenbacks . Is it in enforcing legis
ip- lation for the benefit of working men,
or in raising an army to protect the
cause of the evils which now burden
us down f Certairnly not! The peo
ple of this country must return first
t1 to Democratic principles ! Outside of
ng them all is storm and shipwreck. The
he St. Louis platform covered the entire
it- case and proposed a Radical remedy,
in but that platform proposed no more
tic than what had been Democratic faith
ue evinced by works for a hundred years.
o- Under Democratic rule there is no
. favored class. The burdens of gov
o ernment bear equally upon all ; the
weak are protected from the strong,
and the strong encouraged to exer
in tion for the good of the weak. Money
d(1 will be plenty when Democratic prin
ciples are practiced, niot because con
chl fidence will be restored alone, but
because no one avenue of investment
will be made more secure than anoth
er. There will he no hording of gold
e, in thie interest of National Banks in
order that they may practice usury
of on the farmer; nor will there be any
'o- bonds sold for Ntational Currency in
g. order to "contract" its volume and
let in more National Banks to assist
in grinding to .impalpable (lust the
e agricultural interests of the country.
The Democratic party is the peo
ple's party, its principles are the
principles of patriots and sages, atnd

Its- The Cotton Worm.
the fThe people of our parish have been
greatly alarmed during the past week
rifl or ten (lays, and necessarily so we
or think, with regard to the cotton cater

L''P and upon them our farmals depend
ln, for means, as well as do all for hn
us slness. Anxiety still prevails at this
,ay writing, (Friday) but the poison is
Not being vigorously applied, and with
ree the most happy results.
ted The worm appeared in large num
""- hers in certain Hill sections last week,
the on Friday we believe, and the farm
hat ers went to woik with Paris Green
a and sprinkling pots on Monday.
ay 'l'Tesday and Wednesday we saw a
tli- number of gentlemen from the neig' h
mie borhoods where the woi ins were in
a- largest numbers, and where the pIi
ison had been generally applied : ihy.
ur- tell us that the wso ms were sl;ugh
ill. tered on every place except one, a:II
be there the poison had heen applied too
ers laIte. This hill section is pronounced
'le safe from the wornm.
for The river has not been so fortunate.
ere Mr. Terence Chalar's plantation, or
ren that part of it on the west side of
Cane River, has been particularly un
th- fortunate ; the worms appeared on
Friday last in considerahle numbers
ess and destroyed the crop entirely on
,is- the Tuesday following.
en, From Mr Chbhahrs down, some six
the or seven miles, the crops, where paris
len green has not been applied, have been
eo. eaten up.
irst II. B. \ValnIsley, Esqu., has been de
of Imonstrating with arsenic, and hands
o&e us the following as the results:
tire Take one pound of arsenic, boil in
dy, 10 gillsus of water till dissolved: add
ore water after boiling to make up the
ithi full ten gallons; (a quantity will
ts. evaporate in boiling) you then have
1i0 one pound dissolved in ten gallons of
3v. water; of this mixture take one gallon
the and add to thirty gallons water and
ag, apply to one acie. In other words
er- one and three-tifths ozs. of arsenic is
snfficient for an aere of cotton. Four
in- ounces to the barrel, of 30 gals., of
>n_ water was tried, and the decoction
int killed the cotton.
t The poison is dead sure and killed
th. the worms by thousands, while it did
ild not injure the cotton at all. Arsenic
in is sold by the wholesale at 12" cents
,r per pound and is therefore a cheap as
ny well as sure remedy.
in The battle ag;Inst the worm still
nd goes on with entcuraging hope of suc
ist cess.

Tones Ilayou.
The excitement over the "wash in
the (dam," which was intended to
close 'l'ones layou, has not yet abated.
On the contrary, it increases and
spreads daily. New Orleans has
been aroused to action and her mer
chants are rushing frantically to the
front. We do not deny that the
"Tones Bayou darI has broken down,"
but we do deny that that fact causes
the suspension of navigation in RIed
River.
It is utterly foolish for people to
contend that it does. Last year
Tones Bayou was closed up thorongh
ly, yet the navigation in Red River
was more diflicult than ever known
save in I53 when it was entirely
s.Isi 'lled.
Rled liver below Tnes Bayoun and
its it fi, cel , is dead low and difllicult

is plain : each ' lh th, liiver widens
andl the water i. pt adi, over a larger
surface, hence it is neet'ssarily lower.
This Aiideting hs g,' e, on until the
river from Coushatta ,ldwn is of twice
the width it was twenty years ago.
Two interestst ienlict in this dis
eussion and we contend they should
be calmly looked into before a step
is made. '[The farmers contend that
Tones Bayou opened relieves them
from overtlow in high water, while
Shreveport contends that Tones
Bayou relieves her of her trade with
New Orleans. Let our State engi
neers look into this qrlestion and
ishich ever effects the greater inter
est must be undertaken. If the ag
ricultural interest, within the radius
of the Bayou Pierre, Red River and
Tones Bayou conntry, is greater to
the State than the mnere conmmerce of
Shreveport, then Tones Bayou should
and must be opened : if it is not, then
let it be closed at once and for all
time.
We contend that the navigation
thlrou~nl Winsev, Bayou Pierre and
out thron. h Tones Btelyo is better,
or woul lie if the latter bayou was
opened, than arotund the iwidened Red
River proper. Howeve'r, we may be
mistaken, but if we ate, we err in the
society of one of the best engineers
this State ever employed (General
DeRussey) in that mistake. Let us
discuss and weigh this business calm
ly and do that which is best.
Myers- Report -
The report of Myers, School Treas
urer of Natchitoches parish during
Kellogg's time, is being probed by
oar reporter to the bottom. For in
stance, Mlets says that lie paid
$5,0 of warrants drawn on the fund
of IV76. We find that $(6,3tO) in war
rants were issued in all during that
year, consequently there shioul have
been only .5t! in" warrants ontstatlnd
ing: but Tl':;asunrer Lemee, registered
thirty three hundlred dollars. Myers'
relport therefore is false to the extent
of teentl-eiqht hundred dollars. In
.other words, Myers owes this parish
$200 on tihe funid of 1876 alone.
