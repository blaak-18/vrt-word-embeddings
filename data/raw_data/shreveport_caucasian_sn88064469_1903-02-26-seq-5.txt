Mary 3rady,
M&e Fearless
Woman Jailer
IT used to he said that there were ne
women vikings. but a few month'.
ago the skeleton of a woman bur
ied with her horse and armor was
found in Norway. The fact that the
armor fitted the woman's skeleton "as
though she had been melted and
poured into it" proved beyond dispute
that there were also women viking' ,
tremendous, fearless, full of fight.
The viking matter being settled for
good and all, it remains for the United
States today, twentieth century, to
show a woman who is keeper and
guard of a county pail--n jail, too.
where characters as desperate as any
in skins. both white and black. aro
prisoned. That woman Is Mary Grady,
the official jailer of Talladega county.
Ala. Talk of woman's weakness and
helplessness and dependence: Great
Mary Grady is 6 feet 4 inches tall aml
'large and strong irfproportion. Maybe
she is the relnearnatien of that same
tremendous viking lady whowas hurled
with her horse and ar'for in Norway
so many centuries ago. At any rate.
Mary Grady is brave, powerful and
real enough to be anything that mortal
can be. past, present or future.
In Talladira county the heroine is
called "Molly Grady." A correspondent
of the Sunny South printp an inter
view with her that ought to be read
aloud at city women's club meetings.
The story would be so refreshing.
The interviewer found that Molly
Grady had had charge of Talladega
jail six years. and no prisoner escaped
during her term. She is "deeply in
earnest," and that accounts for much
of her greatness. The way she got her
regular appointment was through frus
trating an attempted jail delivery.
That is so good a story It must be told
by Itself. Molly's brother, wrongfully
accused, it turned out, was a prisoner
in Talladega jail. Molly went repeat
edly to see him. Once the man who
was jailer at the time had to go to
the village on an errand while Molly
was at the prison. She could not get
to her hill home because of a storm
that was raging. It was after dark
that the jailer started to the village.
holly had told him she would keep
Ruard during his absence. The faith
ie had in her is evident, for he left her
with the keys. At any moment she
night have opened her brother's cell
knd let him walk out.
Molly stood guard in the night at the
mntrance to the prison. She heard a
rrating sound and a crash at the rear
)f the building. She sprang around
here and saw a man just about to do.
tend to the ground from a wixdow.
"Halt. or I'll shoot!" roared Molly
leady. The man sneaked back in

again. She had no gum, bit he did not
know that. Molly's next move was to
pal like a flash to her brother's cell
and let him out, telling him to stand
guard 'hile she got belp. The strange
part of the story Is that be did just
what she told him. Through her wit.
coutage and loyalty the whole dock of
jaibtfrdu was prevented from escaping.
After that it was only natural when a
vacancy in the jailership occurad that
Molly Grady should be invited to fill it.
Talladega county ought to be very
proud of its Molly Grady.
Not often prisoners test the mettle
at the womean jailer. They know bet. '

An interesting discussion has been
started on the question, "Shall wives
forgive deserting husbands?" Here is
the correct answer: "Let each deserted
wife find out for certain whether her
husband would forgive her and take
her back in case she deserted him for
awhile. Then/ if she is lead sure he
would, and if she still is fond enough of
him to try him again. let her forgive
him."

half filled. Twenty minutes to 12 the
ladies began to drop in frequently.
Quarter to 12 the chairs were nearly
filled and there proceeded the feminine
Interchange of seats and minds and
getting settled. The lone woman who
had orders to be ready at 12 with her
report of the lecture for the afternoon
paper was on needles, but no one else
was.
Ten minutes to 12 Mrs. Ermine and
SIrs. Milyun gravely mounted the plat
form.
"Oh, there's Mrs. Milyun! What's she
going on the grand stand for?" whis
pered a lively lady to her neighber.
Mrs. Ermine stood up and said, "We
will first hear from Miss Romboli, who
will whistle for as a little tune or
two."
' Then Mrs. Ermine slipped down from
the "grand stand." leaving only Miss
Romboli. Mrs. Mllyun and the lecturer
to occupy It. Miss Romboll whistled
very prettily When she fnished. the
,ladies looked at one another, said
"0-h-h!" "A-h-hr' and clapped their
hands softly for her to do it some more,
which she kindly did.
By that time it was 12 o'clock. The
newspaper woman left even before
Miss Romboli began to warble and
faked up a report for her paper. She
had to do 4o or lose her assignment.
and she was a space writer. Ten min
utes after the lecture, according to
schedule time, should have, ended Mrs.
Milyun. a leathery looking little old
lady in black. rose briskly, cleared her
throat and said:
"Ladies, I have been requested by
Mrs. Ermine to introduce the lecturer.
I know the ladies are very bust= and
the audience is restless, but at the close
of the lecture Miss Romboli will give
us another little whistle or two, and I
hope the ladies will kindly stay till all
is finished. I now have the pleasure of
introducing to you Mrs. Bowlful, who
will speak to us on-hm-m-er-the sub
ject announced on the programme.
Ladies, Mrs. Bowlful, who comes to as
highly commended."
Now, Mme. Soulful was a lady much
better and more favorably known 1in
the land than Mrs. Milyun, but Mrs.
Milyun spoke the words "very highly
commended" exactly as if she had
been describing an animal at a county
fair. If Mme. Soulful had her own
thoughts. she would not let her coun
tenance express them, thereby giving
her audience an object lesson in that
self control on which she lectured.
"Mind Building" was her theme. She
told them how they could begin at any
time and build new and Improved
brain cells. "Above all," said Mme.
Soulful, "don't hurry and don't worry.
Calmly concentrate down within your
selves and build new and orderly
thought habits. You express outward
ly exactly the result of your thought
habits in the past. You look like your
thoughts."
Rere leathery little old Mrs. Milyun
looked as though she didn't need any
making over as to appearance, however
the rest might be hit, also as though
she needed nothing more In the way of
orderly and exact thought habits.
Mme. Soulful spoke perhaps three
quarters of an hour. But long ere she
come to her closing advice, "Don't `
worry and don't hurry," the ladies in
the audience began to act as if they
had the running of the planet in
their minds and it would wabble in
its orbit and spill if they did not g:'t
out of the ball. The promptness they
left off at the first end of the lee
tare they put at the last end. Before
and while Miss Romboll whistled they
rustled out by twos and threes and
fours, murmuring:
"Oh, wassat it lovely?'
