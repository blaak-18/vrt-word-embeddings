'peal remarks that only Heaven,
Mississippi and Louisiana remained t
tru; to Democracy. We fear that
by the time, the Republican Con
i`.`" gress gets through counting out
Democrats, we will have only c
Heaven left.
We have heard of dead people c
voting. In some parishes it is said d
that a man must be dead several F
years before he loses the right to c
vote, but who ever heard at a dead f
man elected to office. Well, in
- Creston, Iowa, rather than vote for b
a Democrat the Republicans of
that county elected a dead Republi- ti
can, not being able to find a live ti
one to accept the office. This was t
a landslide, sure enough.

An infernal speculator, named R. ti
A. Wilhams, has boldly announced c
that he is engaged in the deporta- R
tion of Georgia negroes, to Louis- r
iana. It is said that Williams f,
imagines that he is actuated partly by
philantropic motives and that he is te
a real benefactor to the State of th
Louisiana. With due respect for is
the gentleman's motives we enter
our humble protest. The most
humiliating feature about this de- Ti
portation scheme is that the negroes Ot
who consent to leave their homes th
are too lazy to work and absolutely i5
wortbless. su
Speaking of the election the'
Baton Rouge Sugar Planter says: me
"'We beg to inform the esteemed Re
publican party that an election will to
shortly be held in Germany. Any- l
thing they wanted and failed to get en:
last Tuesday can probably be ob- mi
tained in the land of sauerkraut and V
pretzels. We charge nothing for
this information. John Sherman Mi
once accused the Democratic party
of "carrying water.on both should- de
ers." John was dead wrong. Judg- it
ing from recent returns our el
party can't carry anything in an to
election. To the Republicans: If tic
you don't see what you want, just in
ask for it." de

- TJE CRUSADER AND THE
er BOL TERS.
!- The New Orleans Crusader, the
r, negro paper edited by L. A. Mar
re tinet, does not extend much en
m couragement to its new allies, the
planters. Martinet is a Republi
can because he believes that party
offers more -protection, to his race,
and he is too smart not to- know
how much love the sugar-teats have
e for the negro-and Martinet knows
also that should a Republican presi
adent be elected, the planter, in his
usual fondness for good things, will
p- come in for the biggest share of the
n, offices. The Crusader is happy over
:d the election in other States, but Ils
at ten to what it says about Louisiana:
1- But how about Louisiana? What shall
It we call it? We know frauds have been
committed; but have the "saccharine Repub
licans" kept their word and have they seen
that three, two or even one Republican was
,e elected to Congress? Have they done their
d duty, their whole duty?
Emphatically we say, no! If not a single
Republican is returned elected from this
o State, the ""Lily Whites" cannot shake off
d from their sholders an responsibility.
n Their mistakes, their shortcomings have
been many, but we cannot go into the sub
ject today. When all the returns are in and
we have heard from our correspondents in
- the parishes, we shall make an analysis of
e the votes cast and of the causes that led to t
g the discomfiture of our "New Republicans." I
To the following taken from the f
same paper we would call the atten- t
- tion of some of our white Republi- I
d can friends, who hope to see the
Republican Congress unseat Mr.
Price, who was beyond all doubt,
s fairly elected; b
r As the Daily Crusader predicted yester- g
a terday, the great Republican victory is more Ii
f than the defeat of the Democracy simply; it s
r is the beginnig of a Republican era that will ti
eventually destroy its twin monster, "white I
supremacy."' i
t The handwriting on the wall is plain. 1
The House of the tiext Congress will thor- tl
oughly investigate lynching and its causes in c
the South, and the following Congress-the ij
55th-will study the "re-actionary legisla- P
tion" of Southern legislatures and enaLct r
such laws as will restore the rule of the ti
majority in every State of the Union and se- n
cure to each a republican form of govern- c,
ment. P
The "L.ily Whites" will no longer object ci
to this programme, for we understand they ID
would have been happy, yesterday if they ; is
had "force bills" and provost marshals to ! I
enforce them, things which they spared C:
much energy on the stump during the can
vass to decry and explain no longer existed.
cl
RESURGAAM t.
Memphis Commercial Appeal. at
The Democratic party is not B
dead; it only sleepeth. The shock at
it received Tuesday was of that S
electric character which tends rather
to its reanimation than its dissolu- Iii
tion, and it will rise again stronger er
in its leadership and stronger in the
devotion and faith of its members. th
For a century it has stood as the op- di
ponent of class legislation. It has
been as a mountain in the way of ye
the monopolist. It has been the wi
refuge of the oppressed. Its mis- a
sion can not be fulfiilled until the ol
day shall come when the poor shall oc
be taxed no longer for the benefit pr
of the already rich; when the legis
latures shall no longer grant special
privileges to some ci'izens at the rec
expense of other citizens; when the c
flag of the Union shall float over a
people whose laws rest with d
equal weight upon ever} individual.
Not till then will the mission of the n
Democratic party be closed. To- wv
day the party of monopoly, the th
party of class legislation, the party
of high taxes and low public morals, sh
the party of special privileges-the N
Republican party-has gained a h
victory, and should it regain, two
years hence, entire control of the
goverment, its established policy he
will be prosecuted as in the past-- ha
one section of the people being to
forced to pay tribute to another. be
The leopard cannot change his
spots. The defeat of the Demo- n
crats was due solely to the feeling th
of disappointment pervading the i
country, that those charged with he
meeting the obligations of legisla- wC
tion the Democratic party had as- up
sumed, had "come tardy of't." It co
is inconceivable that the people are t
opposed to tariff reformation. th
The result of the election contains an
no such lesson, and when they shall e
realize the extent of the injury they
have done themselves, by checking
the Democratic party in its move- w'
ment toward reform, they will be pri
ready to restore it to power. Thus, an
the reuolutlonof x896 will be greater as
than that of 5894. The Democrat
who remained at - home last week
will go to the pools two years hence. do
Tennessee and North Carolina, sui
Kentucky and Missouri, West Vir- us
ginia and Indiana, New York and
Co~sanecticat, New Jersey and Cali
fornia, will return to the Democrat
ic colan, for there will be leaders EK
who.wiUl lead, the traitrls :iU. .be s.
of party will ben be .as mighty, vPal
be iant, harmonious a-rmy, with the
n- true flags flying, with a spirit of
Il cordial cooperation at the council
fire, with the plan of battle well de
E fined, and with the assurance of
victory in every heart.

r Last Prop of Bolting Planters
Knocked Out.
Washinton, Nov. 13.-It is quite
evident that the Republicans here
have given up all idea of making a
a contest in Louisiana. Despite the i
cries of fraud and intimidation,
a which were raised by Ferris and his
is horde of "sugar teats" before the I
ir result in Louisiana had been de- t
termined, and the inflamatory dis
C patches which were sent out from i
is New Orleans to the Republican a
f stalwarts in various portions of the r
country for the purpose of building
e up a support for a contest, the Re- e
publicans here and those in author- tl
ity at Republican headquarters, ii
" with the facts now in hand, realize
f the hopelessness of disproving that
the election of Congressmen Meyer c
Buck and Price was anything but p
fair. This will prove poor consola
- tion to the adherents of the Nat;on
l Republican party of Louisiana, and c
to many of those who were thirsting
for a political job, but here are the h
facts:
In an official statement given out c
by the National Republican Con- b
gressional Committee tonight, show- a
I ing the revised list of the member- rn
t ship of the IHouse of Representa- ,
I tives of the next Congress, the solid t(
Democratic delegation from Louis- p
lana is conceded to be electe,. a
There are no "ifs" and "ands" about a
the statement, each of the Demo
cratic candidates being named in the
list. The list shows that the coin
position of the next House of Rep
resentatives from the standpoint of:
the Republican Congressional Com- -
mittee will be. as follows: Republi- ca
cans 246 members, Democrats 104, g
Populists 6. The Republicans also
concede the election of the entire
Democratic delegation from Miss
issippi and Arkansas, and the solid
delegation; fromh Alabama with the
exception of Howard (Pop.)
St. Mary went Republican, Nat
chitoches and Union went Pop, and
these are the homes of the governor,
attorney-general and auditor.
Brothers Pickett, State treasurer,
and T. S. Adams, secretary of;
State, are still backed by Demo
cratic majorities. The last elect;on
certainly cut some very queer po
liiical capers and "high jinks" som
ersaults.-Shreveport Times.
These gentlemen didn't carry
their parishes, Bro. Times, but they
did their best, and that is all an
honest man can do. Here in Lafa
yettee we have not been honored
with a place on the State ticket since
a long time before "de w.h," but
our parish rolled up the largest I)en:
ocratic majority in the district,
proportionately speaking.
Susan 13. Anthony says that the
reason that the average woman
can't make herself heard upon the
platform is simply because she
doesn't know how to hold herself.
"If I snuggled my chin well into my
neck and bent my shoulders for
ward and talked' way down in my
throat like the average woman does,
I couldn't make myself heard either",
she declare,: in a receat interview.
No, the way to let your voice be
heard is to throqw your shoulders
back (or 'raise your chest' as the
Delsarte disciples call it,) keep your
head erect and talk as though you
had something in particular to say
to the people on the last row of
benches. There isn't a woman
living who, if she saw her small boy
in mischief upon the other side of
the street, would drop her head and
timidly observe: 'Johnny, come
here.' Indeed, she wouldn't ! She
would let the welkin ring with clear,
upheaded tones of: 'You, John,
come here!' And John would come,
too, instanter, and that's the way
that any woman should speak upon
any subject that she want folks to
hear about."
