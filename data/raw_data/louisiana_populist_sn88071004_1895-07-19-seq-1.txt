CLOUDS THE WORLD.
THE SINGLE GOLD STANDARD
BRINGS RUIN.
An Artclee In Which It is Shown That
All the Great Governments Are Anmo
ally Spendingr More Than Their In
comes, and the Reasons.
The effect of present causes is as
sure as that the policy that now rules
the world continues. The whole
power of organized government
throughout the world is directed to
the collection of interest on money
loaned. And the corelated fact is that
the chief end of business is to borrow
money. The nation is considered
highest in prosperity that can borrow
money cheapest. At bottom it is this
fact that makes the demand for a
single measure of values-gold. It
simplifies usury and increases the
power of the usurer class.
The etTect is seen in Europe more
than in this country-for there the
money lenders absolutely own the
governments, and the civil power,
standing armies and ships of war are
but collectors of usury. We are re
minded of this fact with great force
by an article in a continental review,
the Message d'Athenes, under the
title of -"What Prince Bismarck Costs 1
Us." It is from the pen of Gen. 1
Turr, a Hlungarian civil and military
engineer. \We put aside the title and I
animus of the article and deal only
'with its facts and firures. for after all
Bismarck was only what the govern
ing system of Europe made necessary
for his country in the general strife
of selfish power and of government at F
the expense of the people for the ben
cfit of dynasties-the descendants, as I
a "nobility," of the ancient robber
chiefs of a barbarian age.
General Turr shows that what is t
called -*the peace of Europe" is main- t
tained at the enormous cost of $1,0O0,- t
0J0,000 a year for armies alone. In n
the the last twenty-five years it has r
cost #25,000,000,000, and still this
enormous drain on the labor of the
peoples of Europe is going on without e
hope of abatement. t
Germany expends 1825,000,000 a
year and collects $725,000,000. b
France has increased her debt 1425,- e
900,000 in nine years, while she col- '
lects now $640,000,000 and spends
$690.000,000. And this writer sums b
up the balance sheet of all Europe as c4
$2,980,000.000 collected and $3,300,- di
000,000 spent annually-or a debt in- o
crease of $320,000,000 each year. o0
This is the gift of the gold syndi- a
cate-the system of the usurer-to
Europe, and had the writer looked
across the water he might have t
added the United States to the list a
with her peace increase of the public PI
debt of $150,000,000. iM
What is to be the end of this sys- e
temrn? Ei her an instant change, or P1
in Europe the repudiation of this s
enormous burden by war. Does any
body suppose Europe can go to war
and pay this debt both? The United g
States can yet pay, and the vultures si
of usury are now fastening their hold U
upon America against the day when
Europe breaks down and its oppressed ki
peoples are unable to longer pay and tu
eat both.
We hear the cry of "-Repudiation." of
Did you ever see a flock of buzzards **1
driven from their feast of death that ac
they did not cry out as if overwhelm- SI
ed with grief and indignation? But
there is ip life where they fatten,
notwithstanding. England is the first
to proesit agalast repudiation, yet her or
vast Slamolal power rests On the mas- c
ter swindle and repudiation of the pl
world-her onsols. The principal W
of her cosols she never expects or b
proposes to pay, and compromises
with he arelsters by a dole of nomi- wi

dream before of sueh a giganuo repu- is

Come to People's Party.
When Populipt speakers in '92, '93
and '94 arraigned the national bank
ing system and exposed the legalized
robbery of the business and farming
interests of America by the national
bankers, the old party hacks de
nounced us, and branded us as anarch
ists and calamity howlers.
When the Populists proved that na
tlonal banks got money from the gov
ernment at 1 per cent and speculated
on it, the old party hacks denounced
us as liars.
When we proved that the farmers
were forced to pay from 12 to 50 per
cent Jor the use of money, the old
party hacks denounced us as stirrers
up of strife, and the Democratic press
of Georgia, with an unbroken unanim
ity, defended the national bankers.
We told the people that the national
bankers deposited an interest-bearing
bond with the government; the govern
ment Issued the bankers money at 1
per cent, exempted the bond from tax
ation, and in addition thereto paid the
bankers to loan money direct to the
farmers, but we couldn't hammer the
facts into the heads of the country
merchant and the farmer.
We told them it was legislation in
favor of a class and would result in
slaving the merchant and the farmer,
EInt the old party hacks and news
papers stuffed the earb of the merchant
and farmer with moss-backism, negro
domination and white supremacy, and
our warnings went unheeded.
But we never faltered. We knew
we were right and believed that the
time would come when our course
would be vindicated-when the mas
qierade of the bond-holders would end
and the maskers would be forced to
Unmask.
The average reader-we care not

W. W. Mullins, Nashville, Tenn.:
Dear Sir-Your kind letter, with clip
pings, in regard to the dispatch sent
from Indianapolis to Chicago was re
ceived yesterday. No. There is not one
word of truth in the report. I defy any
person to prove that I ever publicly or
privately favored the idea of Populists
joining the silver Democrats. I have
spent too much time and work to get
people to leave the old parties and I
shall not only not raise my hand to get
them to go back, but shall do all I can
to prevent them from doing so. I have
always been in favor of making the
fight on the money question unencum
bered with details or side issues and
recent events have proved that I was
right. The money power for the first
time realizes that a great conflict with
the people confronts them and now is
the time to meet them on their chosen
ground. Secretary Carlisle's speech at
Covington, Ky., indicates that they
don't intend to yield one inch. Let us
push the money question to the front
and hold other issues In abeyance until
this is settled. I am in favor of unit
ing all the people opposed to the gold I
standard and banks of issue into one
party, under one bannel', and on one
platform and candidate in 1896; but it a
is impossible to do this in either the
Democratic or Republican parties. It
would be a waste of words to discuss
such a proposition.' At present, the n
people who are opposed to the gold trust s
are divided into four hostile camps. If s
they can be united next year the vie. h
tory is won, bdt if they cannot, the o
contest for '96 is lost. In my opinion a,
the People's party is common ground t
upon which all these elements can E
stand. With best wishes for the suc- 11
cess of our cause, I reinain, fraternally o0
yours, "H. E. TAUBENECK. I

"I gained my convictions on the ail- re
ver question from Carlisle in 1878;1 it
Thurman taught me, and even Judge di
Durham contributed to my store of w
knowledge. The free silver doctrine di
is true Democracy. Of Carlisle I have at
nothing to say. He has changed his go
mind. I haven't. If his ideas as al
presented in the Covington and Mem- ai
phis speeches are carried out your 'a
prosperity will go to nothing. Gold la
will run away, and that will bring oi
disaster. He says gold and silver to
bear the government stamp simply for di
the convenience of society. Make gold tb
and silver bullion and rob them of their it
money functisl, and you might as well pl
have lead." a

handled the subject ably and made a

e CALDWELL FOR SILVER.

2 Populist Platform.
Hon. Henry C. Caldwell, senior Unit
t ed States Circuit Judge for the Eighth
Judicial Circuit of Colorado, first mtde
District Judge by President Grant, and
promoted to the Circuit Judgeship Lt
President Harrison, wrote a letter
Â° under date of St. Louis, April 30, to at
old army friend, now in Denver, in
which, among other subjects, he speaks
* freely and frantly upon the silver ques
tion. The letter was written without I
any supposition that any part of 11it
would be given to the public, but the I
friend to whom it was written, whc I
Sis an ardent silver man himself, as
sumes the privilege for the sake of the
good cause to make public a part of
what the judge writes about silver.
Judge Caldwell's utterances are bold, a
clear and unequivocal. The following a
is from the letter:
"The country is about entering upon t
another struggle for the protection of
the rights and the promotion of the in- u
terests of the laborer and producer, b
which is, in my judgment, of even more e
moment than the first. I have been f
surprised that the issue has been
so long delayed. The fight ought tc t
have been forced years ago on the line f
of absolute and unqualified free coin- y
age of gold and silver at the ratio of 1f q
to 1, without regard to the action of
England or any other foreign power
If we are subservient to England in
our financial policy, why not in other
matters? The financial policy of a na
tion determines its strength and pros
perity and the nation which consents
that another and competing nation may d
regulate its financial policy will find e'
its producers impoverished and its in. P
dustries destroyed, and the nation itsellf
will soon be little more than a mere
dependency of the power to which it ti
surrendered the most vital function of el
government if we are not capable and ti
able to establish and maintain our ows di
