the past voted the Democratic tick

instincts of race, are united to a

the he^t interest of their country.
A beginning is necessary, and why
not begin at once, in the great work
of organization. We do not, nor
do \yo believe il to be the intention
of aliy one to wage war upon the

What we have advocated, and will

some political policy and some dis
tinctive pgrty name, if it be neces
sary, that will unite our people and
cause.them to burv all dissensions

of the past. The "Democrat" is
aware that there are prejudices in
this parish ami Htate, against- even

history, whether these be, well

Trial of the Colfax Prisoners.
Our latest advices fr«m the trial
when one <if our Editors returned
from STew Orleans, On Saturday
last the defense were still examin
ing their witnesses, with a prospect
of concluding abouThursday last.
The argument will jirobalily take
two diiys and as the verdict of the
.fury is one of the uncertain things,
it may be Monday or Tuesday next
before the eifd of the trial is readi
ed. °We learned from conversation
with tho prisoners and their coun
sel, that they îjre confldenfc that the
most they ha ve to l'ear is a mistrial.
There is hardly a possibility of the
conviction of any of them. The ne
gro"witnesses were pretty weH drill
ed in ono tale, but as this tale va
ried Considerably from that told by
them on the hist trial and as they
suffered from cross examination by
the defense, their whole testimony
bore upon its .face the stamp of its
falsehood. The witnesses for tho
defense made short work of prov
ing tho perjury of. the paid negro
witnesses, o For instance, numbers
of them swor0diat Dennis Lemoine
was in the fight and that they re
cognized him there. Dr. >S, O.
Scruggf? proved tlyit on the day of
the fight, Easter »Sunday, Lemoine
was at his house, twenty odd miles
from Colfax, with a sick child and
that he prescribed for the child.
This is a fair sample of the prepar
ed testimony of tho negro witnesses.
Meekwith, tho persecutor, is might
ily "down in the mouth" since Mr.
Ellis took him down oft tho high
horse he ha^lieeu riding, and we
opine that we will have no more of
'MtendH of bell" etc in his speech to
the jury. The Judge, Woods, can
not. conceal his prejudice against
the prismiors and does not hesitate
to decide nine out of every ten
points against them.
are by fhe packet on Monday last*
The jury is composed of eleven
white men and one negro, but they
are mostly men-whose proclivities
are unknown. The prisoners them
selves are in good? spirit s and health
and say that tliey are well treated
by the officials in charge of them.
They are well cared for by the com
mittee "of seventy and the citizens
of New Orleans generally.' Judgi
Woods has pledged his word that if
fins trialjesults again in a mistrial,
he w ill allow the prisoners bail. We
think that it is almost, certain that
they will soon be allowed to breathe
j the air of freedom again and bo per
mit ted f'o return to" their families
and lionies, aller having suffered a
publica,! persecution such as has
but seldom been- met with in the
history of civilization. The witness
es for the defense are mostly pres
ent and awaiting their turn with
exemplary patience. The Marshals
found money to pay the negro wit
nesses in full in cash, but when it
came to pay in g 'the witnesses for the
defense, if happVned very singular
ly that Uncle Sam was out of mon
ey and that they could only be paid
in certificates that were subject to a
discount of 25 per cent. The, coun
sel for the defense soon blocked this
"little game" by refusing to dis
charge any more of them until they
wofo, paid in full:
• The presence of Mr. It. If. Marr,
the chairman of the Committee of
Seventy, as one of the counsel has
made a wonderful change in the as
pect of affairs for the prisoners.
This eminent gentleman iias his
whole heart in the cause and de
serves," as he is receiving, the most
unqualified praise for his efforts in
behalf of these unfortunate and per
sebuted prisoners.
IT^ With the scarcity Of mails,
owing to the continued high water
below, wo find it impossible to give

Tho Rapides Cemetery Association .
This Association held a meeting
0 " Thursday last in tho Town Ilall
which was numerously attended by
tho ladies, and although there we're
bût few gentlemen present, they
made up in interest, what they
lacked in numbers. A charter had
been obtained sometime ago, but no
organization under it had been
gone into because of tile lack of sub
scriptions. The Charter fixes the
shares at five dollars so as to be
within reach of every one. Tho
lirst busincsji gone into w_a§ the sub
scription to tho stock of tho Asso
ciation when something" over three
hundred dollars was subscribed by
those present. * Tho officers and
board of directors, lour of whora-are
ladies, were then elected and a per
manent organization was gone into.
A committee of ladies was then ap
pointed to solicit further subscrip
tion to tho stock and it is hoped
that such an amount will bo sub
scribed as tliat it will only be ne
cessary to call for ono fourth or one
half cash.» The Board of Directors
will proceed at once to take the
matter in hand and propose, to put
a fence around the grave yard at
once, and <*Tear out the underbrush,
lay out walks and new lots, have a
sexton or gardener to take charge
of the grounds and beautify them,
and in short to tako full charge of
the cemetery and improve it as it
ought to be improved and protect
it as it ou#ht to bo protected.
At presenf? it is impossible to
keep a flower, shrub or ornament of
any kind in any of the private lots,
a's they are stolen almost as soon as
planted. And it is a fact and a
burning shame' that even thé iron
railings, tombstones, bricks and ev
erything belonging to the graves
afe stolen and carried away. The
human beast who would desecrate
tho graves of tho dead, deserves
that his carcass should be the food
of buzzards when ho dies. Wo do
not know and have no idea who it
is that has been robbing the graves,
but we do know and we have a very
strong idea, that a repetition of the
•offense now will be speedily follow
ed by a hempen* cravat for the per
petrator or perpetrators whoever
they may be.
' The writer of this has been liam
mering at this subject so long and
persistently through tho columns
of the Democrat and the little »Sen
tinel, as well as in the Caucasian
since its start, that it" delights him
to know now that something has re
ally been done and that at last'the
matter has assumed a tangible
shape. 0
We don't intend -to let it bo for
got! en for an instant now, and we
are sauguine that before many
months the Pineville Cemetery will
be a pleasant place of resort and
communion with the memory of our
dead, rather than a cattle and hog
pasture. ®
The minutes?of the meeting will
Uc found in another column, as will
also a notice of the meeting of the
Board of 0 Directors, on Thesday
next, the 9tli inst., at the Town Ilall
at 10 o'clock A. M.
tW Wo publish this morning a
notico of divino service nt tl#i Town
Hall at 11 o'clock, on Sunday, tomor
row, by tho Rov A. E. Clay.
To thoso who desire to be delight
fully entertained as well as instruc
ted, wo can say be &uro to go. The
Rev. Mr. Clay is recently from Man
chester, England; ^d joined tho La.
Conference of tho M. E. Church at
its Into session in Baton Ronge. He
is the preacher in charge of tho Ev
ergrec0work, but for tho last ten
days has been aiding tho Rev. .C.
Keener, of this place in a meeting on
Bayou Rapides, and in.a protracted
meeting now going on at Pineville.
Tho meeting at Pineville is ono of un
usual interest and those who have at
tended speak in unmeasured praise
of Mr. Clay's preaching. We advise
thoso who desire a feast of good
things to attend the Hall on next
Sunday and attend early so as to get
ja good seat.

gtrof the Association, with a com
plimentaiy ticket, we repaired ear
ly on Monday night laut, to the
Hall of the Thespians,' and as we
expected, found a large, select and
appreciative audience already as
sembled. The occasion being a
benefit for tlie Sisters of Mercy
drew a largo attendance, irrespec
tive of churches or nationalities
■These charitable and self-saeraflc
ing ladies devoting themselves to
the good of the entire «immunity,
it must have been gratifying to
thein.to ktlow tjiat the entire com

their efforts, and sought to honor
as well as aid them, by their pres

Miss Goulden as Maude, made their

must in. justice to tlîeni Bay, that
their performance was excellent
and freer from tho embarrassment
that was naturally to bo expected,
than their friends could have hoped.
They sustained their parts with
much credit to themselves and to
the entire satisfaction of their

The tragic talent of Tlios. Craw
ly Esq., is of the first order, and if
lie chose to cultivate it, and adopt
the profession of the stage, there
would await hiin a brilliant future
in that line. His rendition of
Will Waterly , was perfect, and was
greeted with frequent applause.
Mr. William Leckie, as Clement
Ifanvern, fully understood his part,
and acted it well and forcibly.
Air. Jack Beilly as Jerry Jour
ningham, w as especially noticeable
for the correctness and perfection
oi his acting. Mr. Biossat Kachal
as Lient. Doiriiigton and Simon
Levi, gave us the very picturo of
the originals for which the charac
ters were intended, and his thor
ough conception of the parts and his
having perfectly learned them,
made his rendition of them worthy
of particular notice. Wo observed
fhe new appearauco of Messrs.
Wm. Marsh and Juo. Graham, and
the re-appearânee ot Mr. Francois
Bouillotte, in their several roles as
given above. They all performed
their parts well.
Our genial friend, David T. Staf
ford'Esq., was the Judge upon the
triah and represented the majesty
of the law with dignity and credit
to himself. The denoeumcni having
been reached, "The Skeleton at the
Mound " having been unearthed,
the death by his own hand df the
murderer, and Hie free acquittal by
his confession, of Clement Danvers,
who has been suspected, and all
being happily arranged, the curtain
dropped upon The Skeleton Wit

We were then favored with a
song by Mr. Isaac Sackmau, who
was encored and had to give us an

audience, that they vociferously
called for still another and contin

and was frequently applauded.
Mr. Fitzgerald a a Peter Spyke,
was peter himself, and displayed a
true idea of t|t character. His
performance of the part' could hard
ly bo improved upon in any Thea

did remarkably well, and deserves
