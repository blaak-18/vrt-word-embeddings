PResident Cleveland in • his cee
br-ted-message of x888, and since
heralded throighout the land by our
orators and statesmen, is not to
impose heavy duties on articles of
mportation fothe-s tae of protne c
tioc alone, nor to allow then to en
ter our ports free of duty, buty t
laya tariff thereon for the main
purpose of raising revenues to de
bray the necsssary expenses of the
government. Hence, i the Wil-to
son bise had imposed a reasonable
tarim on sugar, salt, lumber, iron
and coalon, and provided for a fair
reduction on cotton bagging, ito
Would ha met with the general
approval f the people of the ouain
try, especially of Louisiana.
Of the Louisiana delegation,
Messrs. nmelanchard and Bo thne Wil
voted for the bill and Messrs. Rob
ertsrion, sugarPrice, Meyer, and Davey cast
their votes agcoainst it.
The general opinion is that the
Senate will do away with the income
tax which will leave a deficit in the fis-Loui
cal revenues and a reasonable dutyon
sugar will, of necessity,ch e impose
bvot amendment to the bill, so as tob
raise sufficient revenues to run the
government. Dispatches Davey. froast
Wasington bring the happy news
that our senators, Hons. E. D.
White and Don Cafery will doo allay with the income
in their power to securessi theim passaed
of the desired amendment and thu
supply the dficient and ato run the
time incidentally protect one of
the leading industries of Louisiana.
In their power to sectate of man about
one in every hundred can be with
drawn from the production of nece of
saries for the purpose of manufac
turing articles of luxury; but as a
knowledge of labor saving machinery
is acquired, his per cent is rapidly
increased. Before the invention of
the steam engine, about one in every
forty was withdrawn. In our present
state the per cent has increased to
one in every ten, and it is only a
question of time until it will be pos
sible to withdraw one in every five
of population. With such a small
proportion engaged in producing
actual necessaries, a large increase
will result in the number of those
who depend upon a livelihood by
supplying the professional classes
and skilled workmen, and in' every
occupation, and calling there will be
a demand for education. Those
who are capable will readily find
employment, while the ignorant and
unskilled will be forced to the wall.
Already we find this to be the case,
and as labor-saving machinery dis
penses of ignorant labor and brute
force, an absolute requirement of
skill and education will make for the
bare privilege of a living. Consi
dering the rapid progress in all
mechanical arts within the last So
years, this fact becomes a very
interesting one to parents at present. 4
They ought to impress the absolute
necessity for giving an education
to their children. Parental loveshould
of itself be a sufficient incentive
to them to equip their children
as best they can for the stern struggle
of life. Besides many are unable
to leave their children enough
money to insure them a safe living
or stalt them in Ilfe, and they owe
it as a duty-to give their children as
thoroegh a.'reparation for life as
they can. Tndoubtedly, as satis
fatorWy and at the same time the
loet expensive way, is to build up
and support public schools. In the
northern states and particnlarly in
the manufacturing ones where the
poportious'ws pophulation engaged in
shmntacturing is so great, and skilled

and the servant put down the money
