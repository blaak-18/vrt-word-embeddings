Labor Weekly Opposes
Third Party Movement
“Labor,” a national weekly newspa
per published at Washington, D. C.,
and owned by 16 associated recog
nised standard railroad labor organi
zations and their official weekly news-
f taper, editorially sends out a warn
ng to its readers urging upon them
the importance of ignoring the St.
Paul third party convention.
According to the editorial in its
April 5 issue, “Labor” says that the
“so-called third party movement is
controlled by communists.” The rail
road weekly also insists that the old
guard is anxious to destroy the pro
gressive cause.” The editorial,
which we reprint in full, is as fol
lows:
“A word of warning concerning the
much-advertised third party conven

17:
"This movement has been launched
under most unfortunate auspices. A

the recognized labor movement will
have nothing to do with the affair.
“In saying this, Labor is not influ
enced by any ‘Red’ hysteria. It knows
this country is in no danger from
armed revolution. It appreciates
that the communists are numerically
Insignificant. ' .
“But Labor also knows that their

An active campaign in behalf of Sen

meeting of the Democratic state com

Tho*,.as Taggart- a party leader,
declared that while Ralston is not a

CONSTITUTION BAR
SEEN IN TAX PLAN
Hilton Advises Charter Vote to
Legalize Cias Levy for
State Highways
Adoption of the proposed constitu
tional amendment authorizing the
state to use gasoline taxes on the
highways of the state is necessary to
remove legal obstacles, according to
an opinion given Wednesday by Clif
ford L. Hilton, attorney general, in
reply to an inquiry by C. M. Babcock,
state highway commissioner.
Mr. Babcock asked the attorney
general -if the constitutional amend
ment is necessary to authorize the
legislature to place a tax on gaso
line. and, if not, what is the purpose
of the “gas tax” amendment, to be
voted on next November.
Replying to the first question, Mr.
Hilton declared that there is no ex
isting provision of the constitution
which would prohibit the legislature
from providing for a gasoline tax in
connection with its use in motor ve
hicles on the highways of t’ie state.
However, present constitutional
provisions provide that public funds
shall not be appropriated to works of
internal improvement. This provi
sion would stand in the way of the
legislature directing that money
raised by a gasoline tax be paid into
the trunk highway fund.
‘The essential purpose of the pro
posed constitutional amendment,”
Mr. Hilton says, “is to remove this
obstacle and permit the money raised
from the gasoline tax to be used ex
clusively in the construction and
maintenance of trunk highways.”

WASHINGTON, D. C., April 21.
—The Hearst newspapers are run
ning Papini's “Life of Christ” sto
ry as a serial feature and speak of
it as the greatest contribution to
the religious literature of a cen

dorsed this story and all seem to
forget what this Italian writer Pa
pini said about Protestants, Prot
estantism and our own beloved
America, as quoted in these des
patches recently.
No writer in all history has been
more severe and nasty in his
criticisms than Papini. He ought
to be kept out of America forever
and his writings not circulated in
this country.
It all goes to show the spirit of
Papini and ids “love” both for our
country and Protestantism. The
papers that defend him and circu

CONGRESS RESENTS THREATENING TONE
OF JAPANESE ILETTER ON IMMIGRATION
(Boreas af
WASHINGTON, D. C„ April 16.
Hasn’t the Unitod States a right to
fence iteelf in and keep out the
hordes of foreigners who demand to
come here, undesirables and incom
petents not wanted without provok
ing war with some foreign nation?
That’s the question that Japan is tnr
ing to force ue to acknowledge right
now, and some people are so weak
kneed that they pretend to say that
the United States is on the brink of
a grave crisis on account of the ex
clusion amendment tacked on in the
Senate to the immigration bill.
The house in passing the Johnson
immigration bill by the big major
ity of 322 to 71 barring all aliens
not eligible and holding the ouota
down to two per cent on the oasis
of the 1890 census, was an expres
sion of American sentiment indicat
ing the feelings of the people of the
country.
Japan through its American am
bassador has entered a most emphat
ic protest because the senate em
phatically abrogated the previous
“gentlemen’s agreement,” so called,
by the almost unanimous vote of 76
to 2. Japan claims that she has
lived up to the spirit of that agree
ment, but the people of the Pacific
coast, who are mighty well informed
on the question, assert that Japan
has not done so and has violated the
agreement right along.. The Japan

ond Avenue South
MINNEAPOLIS. MINN.. April 15. -
To provide proper living accommo
dations for working mothers and
their children, the Volunteers of
America plan to erect a ‘forking
Mothers’ Home” in Minneapolis this
year. The total cost of the project,
including site, is estimated at $150,-
000. George R. Smith, former Min
nesota congressman, is chairman of
the advisory board of the Volunteers.
‘The Working Mothers’ home will
not be an institution nor an orphan
age,” Mr. Smith stated. “It will be
a comfortable apartment home, ar
ranged to accommodate large or
small families. It is intended
serve as a haven for working women,
fighting the gam® of life single-hand
ed in a brave attempt to gain for
their little ones a fair chance to
grow up to useful manhood and wo
manhood. It is not our purpose to
make it a permanent place of resi
dence for these women, but rather
to fill the gap until they are able to
establish themselves.
“In Seattle a similar institution
has been in successful operation for
10 years under the management of
the Volunteers of America. It has
been proven there that such a home
can be made practically self-support
ing, for each mother pays a share of
her earnings to the home.”
Mr. Smith pointed out that while
many mothers are able' to earn
enough to provide the absolute ne
cessities for their children, provided
sickness does not intervene, the ex
perience of the Volunteers of Amer
ica has been that the big problem to
be met is supervision and care of the
children while the mother is away.
The Working Mothers’ home will en
able the mother to go to her work
knowing that the babies will have
proper care, he said.
Headquarters have been . estab
lished at 32S Second avenue south,
preliminary to a campaign for funds
which will be conducted early in May.
The site for the home will be chosen
in a few days.

The senate, following in the foot
