1 ‘ What do we know of the Harvest
Song”?
Our eyes are heavy; the day is long;
The Autumn wind is raw and chill,
And our path toils over the rugged
hill;
After the reapers, we are the lean
Starvelings who wearily, scantily
glean!
14 What do we know of the golden
grain ?
Ours but the stubble, the thorn, the
pain;
Haply the fields were rich in wheat,
But scarce is the bread we have to
eat;
After the reapers, we are the lean
Starvelings who hungrily, hopelessly
glean!”
When rain, sun and soil have prov
en friendly and human toil has met
them trustingly, honestly and perse
veringly, then indeed may we have
the bountiful harvests whose safe gar
nering is celebrated in Thanksgiving
Day—perhaps the most American of
all our festivals. But in all the
preachments scattered broadcast an
nually by the professional admonish
ers of mankind, scant recognition is
accorded the last and noblest agency
prosperity we enjoy—
the human hands. And the pitiful
thought that will intrude despite the
jovial note of good cheer, is that the
harvest -t’ manifold blessings still re
mains for the few, while the many are
numbered with the “starvelings who
glean.” Nature’s laws never discrim
inate between the just and the un
just; whatever of betterment there be
throughout the universe is attributa
ble to the /noble discontent which
seeks to bring comfort and happiness
within reach of all, and to those sim
ple souls who earn their bread by the
sweat of their brows and strangely
take no credit to themselves for lives
of unselfish labor.
As individuals, most of us have
many things to be thankful for; few
but have at least some one thing
which keeps alive the hope, without
which our bodies might continue
somehow to exist, but our souls would
be dead. We will give thanks, each
in our own way, for such sweetness
and light as have made life worth
while, but preferably by some defi
nite act or expression of kindliness
and love to those of our fellows who
may chance most to need a share of
whatever cheer we have. But as a
Nation we are worse than impious to
offer prayer or praise to God while
there are wrongs remaining which we
could right and cruelties practiced
which we could abolish. So long as
thousands of men are not men,
but machines; so long as wom
en are unsexed by slavery and
degradation; and while childish lives
are crushed out; so long as" the fruit
age is reaped by the powerful few
while the many remain mere gleaners
in the rich fields of life, it will avail
nothinto turn aside from a compla
cent perusal of bank clearings, and of
fer lip service to Him, -whose reply to
false worshippers sends its rebuke
Under The Vine and Fig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
across the centuries: Feed my lambs.
True Shepherd surely was He, and
his lambs alway the weak and op
pressed ; and He was ever mindful of
those who glean a pittance only where
wealth has been the reaper.
Each day brings out the fact that
women have executive ability and
make fine business managers and
financiers. Mr. Packard of Boston
-who recently died without a will and
leaving a large fortune, among which
was a shoe factory representing
$500,000, had for his secretary, Mrs.
Jennie L. Doane. She was appointed
by Judge Chamberlain to take full
control and was made special admin
istratrix of this large plant over
many male competitors.
A short time ago 0. D. Earl of
Morrillton, Ark., brought to the
Treasury a fragmentary and muddy
mass of pulp. He was a stockholder
in a bank in his own town but feel
ing a suspicion that it was not safe,
he buried SIO,OOO in a tin pail and
lately dug it up and found it in the
above mentioned condition. One of
the important duties of the Treasury
Department is that branch which ex
amines and restores defaced and in
jured notes and if three-fifths of a
mutilated paper bill can be identified
the government will make it good.
In this case it was found that $9,000
could be reclaimed and he felt happy
that he had saved 90 per cent of it.
This department is in the hands of
a woman, Mrs. E. A. Brown, whose
entire time is taken up in puzzling
out bits of paper money.
Under an act of Parliament last
year women were rendered eligible
to the offices of Mayor of cities and
11 Chairmen ” of county councils.
So the Suffragette movement seems
to have had some definite result.
High Wycombe, a borough of some
fourteen thousand population, is the
first to avail itself of the privilege
of being governed by a feminine
mayor. Singularly enough, she is a
Miss Dove, and if her disposition be
as mild as her cognomen, the bor
ough should enjoy an administration
of unprecedented tranquillity.
GOOD* ADVICE.
Never forget the advice of Themis
tocles. Said that ancient, “I would
bestow my daughter upon a man with
out money, but not upon money with
out a man.” Just change money for
title and see the different reading:
“I would bestow my daughter upon
a man without title, but not upon ti
tle without a man.” —New York
Press.
Many husbands do not realize
that a woman needs something more
than clothes and food and a pew in a
church ; v that she has imagination,
mental energy, tastes that clamor for
recognition, and that she needs rest
and pleasure. Such men keep their
legal vows, but are sometimes unfaith
ful tp their promise not only to love
3effersoniart
but to cherish also. A woman may
be killed by monotony quite as easily
as by more active forms of cruelty.
She needs variety of interests and
plenty of fresh air for her mind.
When a woman marries a man who is
dull by nature she must face her fate;
but many men are unnecessarily dull
—they might become interesting by
leaving business in the store or fac
tory and taking a little news, a good
book, a fresh interest home to the
woman who is tied within four walls
and longs for a sight or a breath of
the world. —Ladies’ Home Journal.
THANKSGIVING.
By Harry Raymond Pierce.
Along erbout Thanksgivin’ time,
when folks start for home,
I think uv times when I’se a boy an’
picked the chicken bone.
We uster have th’ “bestest” time, it
seems ter me just now,
A “poppin’ ” corn, an’ crackin’
nuts, an’ tellin’ company how
Ter hunt th’ whistle that we’d pin, or
tie, on their coat tail,
An’ it makes me grin to think right
now, th’ way they hunt ter find
That whistle that we blow and blow,
’twas “alius” just behind.
When dinner time would come around,
we just could hardly wait,
Fer old folks Jo get served first time,
afore we would pass our plate
For second helpin’ all around, for
things would taste so good,
A follow’d eat a whole lot more than
what he really should.
The medder usually was froze, an’ all
us boys an’ girls
Would start o’ skatin’ through th’
woods, to where the saw mill
whirls.
I jest can hear the echoes now re
soundin’ o’er the hill,
An’ it seems as though I’se young
ergin, an’ orter be there still.
Though times has changed a whole lot
since we all wuz boys and girls,
Thanksgivin’ takes us back ergain,
an’ childish joys unfurls.
An’ why should we fergit them days,
they surely make hearts lighter,
An’ though it’s now but memory’s
dream, it makes Thanksgivin’
brighter.
I tell yer, those was days and times a
feller can’t fergit.
An’ it does him good to think ’em
o’er, if it makes him blue a bit.
Let young folks have “Thanksgiv
in’ ” in the good ole-fashion way,
For time will come, and soon enough,
to work instead of play,
An’ then we’ll think it over, an’ we
all in truth can say:
The happiest time in all the year
comes on “Thanksgivin’ Day.”
—The Lyceumite.
Good vinegar can be made from
apple parings in the following way:
Take the parings and put them in a
six-gallon stone jar and tamp them
with a potato masher till they are
pretty well bruised, then pour water
over them till covered. We continue
to put parings in till they have been
in a week or more, then we strain out
the parings and pour the cider into
a keg and repeat the operation till
one keg is full. We then lay an old
piece of cotton cloth over the bung
and let nature do the rest. In two
months we have a keg of the finest
kind of vinegar.—Oklohoma Messen

The pedestrain paused at the inter
section of two busy cross streets.
He looked about. An automobile
was rushing at him from one direc
tion, a motorcycle from another, an
autotruck was coming from behind,
and a taxicab was speedily approach
ing.
Zip-zip! Zing-glug!
He looked up and saw directly
above him a runaway airship in rap
id descent.
There was but one chance. He was
standing upon a manhole cover.
Quick seizing it he lifted the lid and
jumped into the hole just in time to
be run over by a subway train.—

many months. It isn’t the splendid
appearance ; lone that makes the
