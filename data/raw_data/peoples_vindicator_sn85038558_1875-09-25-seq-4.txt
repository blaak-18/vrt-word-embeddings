WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
Champion American Comic Paper !
Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
can artists, and contributed to by the
most popular humorists and satirists of
the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
Ihas become the established hIumrous and
satirical paper of the eounttr.. It was
started and continuen the first year is a
monthly, then, to saentisfy the delmand of
the puhllie, it was changed to a fortnight
ly. Still contiuning its good work of
hitting fo.ly as it die, and showing up
the lmlitical and social shams by its
masterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater success than
before, and was recognized as tih ablest
and brightest of its class. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
ing the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnish illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels,
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to frame.
In its literary depaltments Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one tiant-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squillm
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fas
tidious.
