TWILIGHT’S
THINKLINGS
BATTLE OF THERMOPYLAE
THE INADEQUATE SCHOOL
THE THIRTEENTH FAIRY
THOKE of jou who are familial
with ancient hlstorj will re
call the Incidents leading to
the battle of Thermopylae. Leading
from Thessaly Into central Greece Is
a narrow pass, pressed on one side
by the sea and on the other by rug
ged mountains. It was the year of
480 B. C. when the Persian army
threatened Greece. Leonidas, king of
Sparta, with 300 Spartan soldiers and
6000 allies, held the pass. The Spar
tans and their allies could be driven
from their advantageous position only
by an attack In the front from all In
dications, as the Grecian tleet seem
ingly prevented Xerxes the Persian
king, from landing a force to the
rear. For two days the Persians tried
In vain to capture the pass. Then a
traitor told the Persians how they
might reach the Spartans and their
allies effectively by means of a by
path over the mountains and strike
from the rear. Too late Leonidas re
ceived the startling Information that
the Persians were approaching along
the secret pathway. At once the
Spartan king realized that It would
be Impossible to hold his strategic
position, and so most of Ills allies
allies withdrew. But for Leonidas
and Ills Spartan soldiers there wa* no
retreat. The Spartans, and the 7(M>
Thespians who refused to lenve their
post of duty In the hour of trial,
died lighting the Persians. The pass
had been given to them to guard, and
they chose death rather than flight
and safety.
From this bit of history we can
learn a real lesson of grim duty, bur
Nordic forbears have given to us of
this generation a great civilization
to preserve Inviolate. Strong forces
have united In one frantic effort to
destroy those things that have made
the I'nlted States the brightest star
In the constellation of nations. The
white-clad Klansmen stand a solid
bulwark against the enemies of
Americanism.
The robed guardsmen are standing
firm as the enemy delivers one terrif
ic blow after another with a fury
born of blind zeal. Thousands of our
Protestant allies have revealed their
yellow streaks und have sought safety
In the background of neutrality. The
hosts of Satan shall not pass. “On
ward Christian Soldiers.*’
A RECENT visit to a one
teacher school comes to
my mind. The teacher of this
school was trying heroically to
teach 27 classes. From 9:00 a m.
to 4:00 p. m. the teacher had 330
minutes for instruction. Now di
vide 330 minutes by 27 and you
will get a quotient of 12 minutes.
This, then, was the average
length of the recitation periods.
But according to the teacher’s
program, there were periods that
varied in length from five to 20
minutes. It doesn’t take a knowl
edge of pedagogy to understand
that a five-minute recitation pe
riod has practically no educa
tional value. With 27 classes a
day on the program, obviously,
only a few 20-minute periods
could be arranged. We need not
be surprised that only the poor
est educational results were
forthcoming.
The one-teacher school is or
ganically wrong. This type of
school makes effective teaching
nearly impossible. Even though
a well-trained and a competent
teacher is engaged, she cannot do
justice to her pupils when from
five to eight grades demand her
attention in the short space of
one school day. The 200,000 one
teacher schools in this country
are not giving American boys
and girls who are compelled to
attend them an educational
square deal. Dr« George D. Stray
er has correctly said, “There is
no equality of educational oppor
tunity in the United States to
day.”
AN HEIR was born to an ancient
throne. At his birth 12 fairies
appeared beside the bed of the
queen-mother. One brought beauty,
one charm, one health, and so on.
Finally a thirteenth fairy entered
the queen’s chamber and offered the
gift of discontent. The king became
very angry and ordered the fairy to
be gone. His royal majesty spurned
the gift of the thirteenth fairy and
•he straightway departed. The prince
Kew to manhood with the Kift* of
auty, charm, health, courage, hind
ness, generosity, patience, etc. But
somehow he never knew the meaning
of progress through personal effort
he was in fact a failure. The prince s
father had lost for his son the gift
that would have given him something,
the lack of which marked him a
ne’erdowell.
No man or woman ever did any
thing constructive without a divine
discontent. A person who is satis
fied with himself and all ( things
about him has ceased to truly live,
in fact he is dead so far aa the world
is concerned. A dissatisfied man ever
••eks new problems to wrestle with.
The dissatisfied person is thejjynimdc
human element that is making the
world a better place In which to live.
Don't confuse the dissatisfied Indi
vidual with the cynic, however.
VOLUME 1, NUMBER 40
IEACH FOR GOVERNOR BOOM
WANING THROUGHOUT STATE
Friends Started Ball Rolling While Minneapolis Mayor
Was in Europe on Honeymoon, Hoping It Would Gain
Momentum, But Hopes Hit Snag—Tickled His Ego.
Ole, Swedish Hardware Dealer, Writes Answer to Business-Political
Letter Sent Out by Ski Manufacturing Concern Advocating Flour
City Executive for Governorship.
MINNEAPOLIS, MINN, April 28.—Colonel George E. Leach isn’t
being as enthusiastically received from a political standpoint as
he and some of his friends expected. The Leach-for-governor boom
was largely confined to an office in a certain building in Minne
apolis. It now r develops that a group of Leach’s friends met on a
certain night, while the Colonel was in Europe on his honeymoon,
and decided to tickle the ego of His Honor by launching a political
boom with the hope that the state would quickly give it some mo
mentum. However, the people of Minnesota did not pay much
attention to me acticities of Loach’s
friends, and the result is that at the
present time the Colonel is only oc
casionally mentioned, and then not
with a seriousness worthy of much
attention. The most careful of Min
nesota political dopesters cannot see
even a passing possibility of the
Flour City mayor getting within “ra
dio range” of the Republican nomina
tion for governor.
Many Strong Candidates
There are so many strong candi
dates out after the Republican gu
bernatorial nomination as to leave the
odds 100 tol against “His Honor.”
Sometimes I wander whether or not
Leach really takes his candidacy se
riously. Surely he knows by this time
that his political stock is low with
few actual calls coming in to stimu
late an upward movement. The slug
gishness of the political market has
quite seriously affected the Leach
stock, there is no getting away from
that fact. Even the trips around the
state on behalf of the starving Ger
man children won’t help Leach’s
prospects to any degree worthy of
note.
Not a few seem to think that his
willingness to go out on a speaking
tour in connection with a certain
drive came as a result of a thought
that his political strength might be
increased thereby. So far as I am
deduct from various items of
information that have come to me,
in only three counties of the state
has he* helped his political prestige
through pleas in. behalf of tne chil
dren of Germany. They are Brown,
McLeod, and Stearns counties. The
drive in which Mr. Leach has inter
ested himself is worthy, but many
throughout Minnesota feel that the
Colonel’s motives are not entirely al
truistic.
Ole Writes a Letter
A ski manufactu> ,-tg company re
cently sent out a circular letter, to
hardware dealers of the state, calling
attention to Leach’s candidacy, and
urging them to support the Minneap
olis mayor. In pointing out reasons
why the colonel should be nominated
and elected, the circular letter em
phasized the mayor’s interest in ski
ing. A hardware dealer with Scan
dinavian ancestors in his family tree
answered the circular letter as fol
lows:
“Ay yust bane reading dat pooli
tic’s latter yu rite me on one ov dem

ALIEN FACTIONS SEEK TO INFLUENCE
PRESIDENT AGAINST JOHNSON MEASURE
(Bureau of Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., April 26.
All the various foreign, alien and
un-American, aa well as selfish in
terests and influences opposed to im
migration restriction, nave concen
trated their assault against the 1890
quota Johnson immigration restric
tion bill on the provision excluding
“persons ineligible to naturaliza
tion.’’ And they are bombarding the
White House nowadays with letters,
telegrams and delegations, just as
they bombarded congress and con
gressional committees a few weeks
ago.
Their fight then was against 1890
as a quota base, but now it is for a
veto because the ineligible to nat
uralization phrase would offend Jap
an. They say the clause if it be
comes a law will disrupt our friendly
foreign relations with Japan. As a
matter of fact the “gentlemen” ag
reement”, which is neither a treaty
nor a law, and absolutely unconsti
tutional because never ratified by the
senate, haa been a constant source
of friction and irritation.
Friends of the Johnson bill should
write short, high-class letters and
petitions to Pre* <t Coolidge ur
fing him to sign the Johnson hill.

houses have been in seaslon and will

OKLAHOMA DRIVE FOR
MEMBERS IS GROWING
Many Speakers Touring State
Holding Invitational
Meetings
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLA., April
26. Since tkr opening the Klan’s
spring activities at Lawton two weeks
ago, the 1924 membership drive of
the realm has been progressing rapid
ly.
The goal has been placed at 300,000
for Oklahoma by November, and indi
cations are that this figure will be
attained.
The membership growth of the or
der was slow until Jack Walton de
clared his ill-fated “war on the Ku
Klux Klan.” During martial law and
since, interest in the work of the or
ganization has increased steadily, and
Klans throughout the state have been
holding weekly initiation ceremonies
with large classes.
The results of the recent munici
pal elections in various cities of the
state, in which candidates supported
by the Klan were successful in every
instance, have also served to arouse
the interest of the aliens in the Klan.
A number of speakers are touring
the state holding open and invitation
al meetings, and report that applica
tions are being received by the hun
dreds and thousands.
Mrs. James A. Wilson major klea
gle, Women of the Klux Klan, Okla
homa Realm, said yesterday she was
greatly pleased with the progress of
the woman’s order. The women are
joining almost as rapidly as are the
men, and in one town in the state,
the local chapter of the women re
cently reported a larger membership
than that reported by the Klan.
Note what the Jewish Criterion,
April 18 issue, published in Pitts
burgh has to say as follows: “The
present house of representatives is
the lowest mentally that has been
known for a great many years. This
(Johnson) bill is strictly Gopher
prairie legislation. We haven’t the
slightest doubt this same congress
could be induced to pass a bill giv
ing the K. K. K. the right to run
the nation. We believe that there
isn’t enough brain matter in the pre
sent house of representatives to pass
a single piece of constructive legis
lation. What is behind this Johnson
bill? Not a thing in all the world but
prejudice, Know Nothingism, Ku
Klux Klanism. Miserable, narrow
bigotry. (Selah, the Jews have all
the brains. There are seven in con
gress and six of them voted against
the bill). The kind of minds that put
over this legislation puts over the ar
rests for selling goods on Sunday."
In other words this paper slurs the
Christian Sunday. Otner alien, hy
peimted papers, racial papers, arc
saying similar things about congress
ever since they got licked on the im
migration bill. It’s now time to g»*t
the ear of President Coolidge and
aid him in standing up just like con
gress stood up and told the aliens
where to git, etc.
America Is for Americans and not
for foreigners.

STAR’S ANTI KLAN
NEWS STORY UNTRUE
\gain False Charges Prove Mali
cious; Klan Completely
Cleared
MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., April 26.
Children that the Klan were accused
of kidnapping have been found.
Clasped in each others arms, and
faces pressed closely together, the
lodies of the two little children who
disappeared here last February’, were
found early today in the Mississippi
river near the junction of Third
avenue S. E. and Main street. The
bodies were those of Harold Prouel
lett, four years old, and Alice Tan
ner, six years old. Alice was the
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Ziner Tan
ner, 428 Second St. N. W. and Harold
was the son Gf Ur. and Mrs. George
Brmellett, 6239 Thirty-second Ave.
South.
The finding of the two children
clears a mystery that has kept the
Minneapolis police guessing for many
weeks. Every clue to the where
abouts of the little tots had failed
to reveal anything at all. The par
ents would not permit themselves to
believe that the river had claimed
the children. Mr. Tanner in a mo
ment of despair seemed to think the
Klan had assisted William Hammond
in kidnapping Alice. Mrs. Tanner
was at one time the wife of Ham
mond, it seems, and was divorced a
number of years ago, receiving at
the time of divorcemnt the custody
of Alice. The Minnesota Star was
quick to use the ill-founded suspic
ions of Mr. Tanner in a news story
attacking the Ku Klux Klan. The
utter absurdity of Tanner’s allega
tions did not prevent the Star from
publishing a malignant falsehood.
The Minnesota Fiery Cross in its
issue of April 11 denied emphatically
the charges of Mr. Tanner and The
Star, stating. “The facts so far re

fense. The indictment was returned
on a true bill and was given to Judge

The grand jury deliberated on the
case less than ten minutes after the
last witness had been dismissed.
Date for trial was set for April 30
and bond of $3,000 was continued.
An effort by the defense to have a
trial this week failed because of the
crowded condition of the calendar.
With a calendar of forty-five cases
to investigate, the grand jury did
not reach the case of Mr. Knutson

two policemen who made the arrests
and the boy who drove their car.

Kfl'ort to Be Made to Bring Klan
into Charge of Excessive
Expenditures
(Bureau of ruhlleation ami education)
WASHINGTON. D. C„ April 25.
The opponents of Senator Mayfield, of
Texas, who have spent five or six
months trying to root him out of his
seat in the senate and failed after
causing the government to spend i
something like $60,000 in making a
recount of the Texas senatorial votes,
must now take another angle in the
fight. They must get a new alibi and
that is what they are trying to con
jure up a* the present writing
The subcommittee of the Eenate
committee on privileges and elections
investigating this case is scheduled to
meet next Monday and listen to the
attorneys for Mr. Peddy, the defeated
candidate, spring a new attack. Hav
ing lost so far on every phase of the
case. Senator Mayfiel is not worrying
ing any over their next move.
The chances are that the Peddy at
torneys will next try to prove that
Texas people spent their money like
water electing Senator Mayfield, and
in this charge they are going to bring
in the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
of the Lone Star state. Be that as it
may, the Klansmen mostly voted for
Mayfield, and that is what hurts the
Peddy fellows. If the Klansmen
spent money freely they must have
been buying their own votes, for so
many of them evidently voted for
Mayfield.
Senator Mayfield states that he is
clearly within the law as to person
ally spending money, and that he
knows nothing whatever as to what
anyone else did. He says the Klan
did not give him money to spend for
the election,' hence he is in the clear
on that proposition.
If the Peddy attorneys are unable
to make this charge stick and lose
out on that as they have lost on the
other charges up to date, they might
as well pack up their belongings and
go home. Senator Mayfield is win
ning his spurs in the senate, is high
ly respected, and his conduct is such
that every one likes him. The chances
are ten to one that he will retain
his seat and go on with his senatorial
duties just as he has up to date.
CHICAGO KLANSMEN TO
HOLD NATURALIZATION
Woiihmi and Royal Riders Will
Also Stage Simultaneous
Ceremonies
CHICAGO. ILL.. April 29.—A mam
moth naturalization ceremonial will
he staged for the 10.000 initiates who
will be ready to renew their loyalty
to America through Chicago’s mam
moth Klan May 30, according to the
directory of the department of ex
tension and education.
This will be the greatest and most
spectacular demonstration yet made
in this state. It will be staged in the
open air, upon a site near Chicago.
The Grand Kolkard will be in person
al charge of the magnificent program
that is being arranged.
In addition to the Rian's ceremo
nial, simultaneous naturalizations
will be held for the Women of the
Ku Klux Klan and for the Royal Rid
ers of the Red Robe.
The exercises will last throughout
the day and until the mystic hour of
midnight, when the gigantic fiery
cross will cast its eerie illumination
over the naturalization ceremony it
self.
The thousands of Klansmen, their
families and friends, who will be per
mitted to observe the ceremony from
a distance, are expected to bring pic
nic dinners and enjoy themselves in
a great get-acquainted meeting.
This gigantic affair is resulting
from the aggressive membership cam
paign now being waged by the exten
sion department in Cook county and
is direct evidence of the success being
achieved under the “Palmer plan" of
centralised organisation.
STIGLEK. OKLA. According to re
porta which have gained credence
here, the Odd Fellows and Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan will unite in
building a two story hull, to be used
as a home for the two organisations.
Actual construction work will start
in about two months.
Pro-Klan Debaters
Win at Oklahoma
University
NORMAN, OKLA., April 26-
Klan student debaters won by a
unanimous decision of the judges,
in a debate on the principles of
the Ku Klux Klan. held under the
auspices of one of the campus lit
erary societies at the university
of Oklahoma here this week. A
large crowd was present to hear
the Klan wranglers defeat the
“antis.”
The formal debate was the cul
mination of many arguments
among the members of the society
on the subject of the Klan. The
“antis” in th» society accused two
of the other members of being
Klansmen. and challenged them to
debate the question: “Resohed
that the Ku Klux Klan is a men
ace to the country.”
They found it very easy to dis
cuss the question on the street,
but encountered an altogether dif
ferent proposition when it came
to attacking logically the princi
ples of the Klan on the floor be
fore impartial judges and subject
to the rules of argumentation and
debate.
The decision of the three judges
was unanimous that the affirma
tive had failed to prove the Klan a
menace to the nation.

Enjoy Trials and Tribulations of
Fourth-Hand Fords and
Highway
BRANCH. MINN.. April
16. Tnirty-one men from the local
Klan organization in two automobiles
and three and a half Fords set out
from St. Paul through the drizzle.
One of them got six miles without
stopping. Another one made ten
miles. One got through on time.
The first car which arrived, a Chan
dler. stopped in front of a Roman
Catholic church and one of the men
entered to inquire as to the location
of the invitation Klan meeting.
Strange to say they received no sat
isfaction. After passing six miles
through the mud and sleet, they
found the meeting place five miles
distant.
During the lecture, the other five
cars arrived. The last Ford bore
eight Klansmen and the materials
for a fiery cross. A bomb was in
advertently detonated. This brought
out in a mad rush the entire popu
lation with the exception of those
at the meeting. All three of them
were there within two minutes, and.
upon being informed, that a car had
back-fired, they retired to their
homes and beds at the usual hour
of 9:15.
After the meeting the cross was
ignited on the other side of the rail
road tracks. Four natives ar.d two
cows witnessed the spectacular feat.
When the cross had burned for about
twenty minutes the thirty-two pil
grims repaired to the restaurant and
partook of a hearty meal which was
enhanced by pie and the fact that it
was gratis. After satisfying their
hunger, the wayfarers climbed into
their Rolls-Royces and ambled mer
rily homeward. A good time was
had by all some more than others.
The Long, Long Trail was sung and
for a while it looked as if it would
be illustrated. Nevertheless, the
last roughneck reached home and
was helped in with the rolling pin
at 4:26.
There was a Masonic lodge formed
in Viiginia City. Montana, during the

This was done without the knowledge or consent of the pastor or
the official board of Asbury Methodist Episcopal church, as was as
certained by a reporter of The Minnesota Fiery Cross. It was not
discovered that this had taken place, until after the service had
begun and it was to late to recall the programs.
It was learned that a member of the committee of this joint
meeting had made the statement that he could get the programs
printed free, and the rest of the committee allowed him to take care
of that work, with the above results.
Such campaign methods are to be deplored, whoever the candidate
might be, and the results of such action are apt to become more dis
astrous thun otherwise to the success of the candidate.

AUSTIN ELECTION
SURPRISE TO MANY
Ugly Charges Made in Campaign
Which Overthrew Old
Administration
AUSTIN. MINN.. April 17.- Many
people on the outside are wondering
whether or not the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan had anything to do
with our municipal election surprise.
Of course it isn’t for us to say what
active forces contributed toward the
defeat of the Jewish administration,
which found itself stranded high and
dry after the ballots had been count
ed.
It is a well known fact that the de
feated administration of Austin has
failed in a goodly number of instanc
es to measure up to the demands of
the citizens, and it was, therefore
bitterly opposed by a surprising num
ber of people. Evidently the politi
cal broom was effectively determined
in that the city administration was
swept away with startling complete
ness.
Several men who arc known to be
deeply interested in cleaner and bet
ter government, worked untiringly
for the defeat of the administration
which now stands discredited. A
number of right-thinking people fear
lessly presented facts-for the consid
eration of voters by means of the lo
cal daily paper. For their interest
in public affairs they received threats
of violence and verbal abuse of a
most vicious type. Nothing discour
aged or intimidated the active work
ers who sought a change of adminis
tration and therefore it can be said
that Austin today has an administra
tion of which it may be justly proud.
Although ugly charges were thrown
right and left, the people weighed
the facts and acted in accordance
with their better judgment.
