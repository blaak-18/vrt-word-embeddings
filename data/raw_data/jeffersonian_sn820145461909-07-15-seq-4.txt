Fortunately for our rasped and
wearied nerves, the announcement of
coal and coke mergers
What Wo comes at the time when
May Expect, our prayer is only for
ice. Next winter, when
the price per ton goes higher even
than it was last, we will wonder how
it happened. Over a score of coal
and railway companies, among them
being the Hocking Valley and Kana
wha and Michigan railway compa
nies, were incorporated under the
beneficent laws of New Jersey, into
the Sunday Creek Company, while
five companies owning approximately
200,000 acres of the richest coal land
in Maryland, Pennsylvania, West
Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio were
merged into a trust at about the
same time; also, a coke combination
representing 78 out of the 81 inde
pendent plants, has been formed.
This means that the price of hard
coal and soft coal and coke is to be
raised. Bituminous, or the soft coal,
is the fuel used by all manufacturing
plants and most families. Coke is
also a fuel largely used by the poor;
so far as anthracite is concerned, it
is the more desirable and expensive
fuel, and as such, can only be af
forded by the well to do, anyhow.
But the crime of increasing the hard
ship on the masses next winter is one
which is nothing short of damnable,
and in every city, petty retail deal
ers of coal rob the poor and helpless
in yet another way. Because the
desperately needy cannot think of
buying so much as a ton or a half or
a quarter of a ton at one time, they
take their little baskets to the deal
ers and for 25 cents get a few lumps
of poor coal, the dealers’ profit per
ton thus being several times increas
ed over the natural profit he obtains
from those able to buy in quantity.
Such things as rocks and brick, care
fully treated with stove polish, are
not infrequently added to make
weight.
Increases in flour, meat and all
food products are cheerfully an
nounced. Altogether, Messrs. Taft,
Wickersbam and MacVeagh seem to
have inaugurated speedily an era of
confidence and prosperity as has nev
er been enjoyed before. It should
simply tickle to death the small con
tingent who are not scheduled to
freeze and starve to death.
The Tariff bill passed the Senate
last week, and is now in conference.
One Democratic Sen-
The Tariff Bill, ator, McEnery, of
Louisiana, voted with
the Republicans all the way through,
and also in the final passage of the
bill. In anticipation of increased ad
vantages given to the protected in
terests by the new tariff law, cloth
ing has already advanced in price;

lion dollars. One rail
road company has already been hit
for $30,000 of these bogus bills.
Harry Thaw through his attorney,
Charles Morschauser, is making an
other attempt to re-
Harry Thaw, gain his freedom. He
has gained several ad
vantageous points; the change of
TJcffersonian
as They Happen to™ D.i an
venue, a favorable selection of
alienists, absence of Jerome as prose
cutor. He has been sane enough to
deport himself while incarcerated to
win the confidence and sympathy of
the officials of the Matteawan Asy
lum, who will make him fine wit
nesses now. We have never ques
tioned Thaw’s sanity, but believed
that from overindulgence during his
childhood and with a very impulsive
and over sensitive disposition, with
an undue amount of resentment, it
was easy for him to be worked up to
the point of violence.
The many efforts and the fortune
that has already been spent to regain
his liberty go to show that the Gol
den Key does not unlock the legal
gates as easily as it is often stated.
The Supreme Court of Tennessee
has set aside the verdict against the
Night Riders who were
Night Riders, convicted of the mur
der of Capt. Quentin
Rankin. This has caused a great out
cry in the newspapers. The Supreme
Court of Tennessee is being savagely
criticised.
Under the laws of that State, the
accused men had not been legally
convicted, consequently the Supreme
Court could not have decided the
case in any other way. The same
people who had very little to say
about the upsetting of the verdict
against the grafters of Missouri and
California refuse to be comforted
about the decision which gives the
Night Riders another hearing. The
decision of the Supreme Court of
Tennessee is not open to anything
like the criticism as those of the
courts of Missouri and California
where sentences against big criminals
have been set aside on account of the
omission of the article the from the ’
indictment, and where it has been
proved that the judges substituted
for their own opinions written opin
ions furnished them by railroad law
yers.
The killing of Captain Rankin was
a heinous offence, but not worse in
any degree than the cold-blooded as
sassination of ex-Senator Carmack by
the Coopers.
v
Col. Marcellus Pointer, of the Con
federate Army, who was, according
to General Joseph B.
Pathetic Case. Wheeler, “the bravest
man he ever saw in
battle,’’ died penniless in a Bowery
hotel in New York last week. Among
other pathetic evidences of the ex
treme poverty to which the old hero
had been reduced was a pawn ticket
which showed that a gold medal pre
sented to him by the Confederate
Congress for saving the life of
“Fighting Joe Wheeler” on the bat
tle-field, had been pawned for SB.
Another pawn ticket showed that he
had borrowed a small sum upon a
gold watch given him by the people
of his home town, Holly Springs,
Mississippi, after his return from the
Civil War.
Samuel Gompers, President of the
American Federation of Labor, ap
pears to have been
Samuel Gompers. ensnared by the
rich Americans in
London. They have taken him up,
lionized him, wined and dined him,
and Mr. Gompers has come out .flat
footed in favor of a very expensive
diplomatic establishment in foreign
countries. He wants Uncle Sam to
buy palatial homes for those who rep
resent us abroad in order that our
national dignity may not lose any
thing in the eyes of snobs and globe
trotters.
We note that the Senator from the
Powder Trust, Mr. DuPont, has in
troduced a bill in the Senate to ap
propriate more money to the Cath
olic Orders in the Philippines. As
we said a year or so ago, we really
would like to see one session of Con
gress come and go when the greedy
Catholic hierarchy is not raiding
our national Treasury. The Papa’s
folks could not even let the extra ses
sion go by without a pull at Uncle
Sam’s hind leg.
i
John D. Rockefeller celebrated his
70th birthday last w'eek and reaped
a large crop of newspaper praise by
donating ten million dollars more to
the general education board. Simul
taneously, the Standard Oil Company
advanced the price of gasoline one
cent per gallon.
We’ll soon know now who the real
President of the United States is,
Taft or Aldrich. —Polk Co. Ledger,
