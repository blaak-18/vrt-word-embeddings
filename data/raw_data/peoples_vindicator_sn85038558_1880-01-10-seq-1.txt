THE GENUINE

THE countenance is pale and lead
en-colored, with occasional lushes,
or a circumscribed spot on one or both
cheeks; the eyes become dull; the

runs along the lower eye-lid; the

bleeds; a swelling of the upper lip;
occasional headache, with humming
or throbbing of the ears; an unusual
secretion of saliva; slimy or furred
tongue; breath very foul, particularly

sometimes voracious, with a gnawing
sensation of the stomach, at others,
entirely gone; fleeting pains in the
stomach; occasional nausea and vom
iting; violent pains throughout the
abdomen; bowels irregular, at times
costive; stools slimy, not unfrequent
ly tinged with blood; belly swollen
and hard; urine turbid; respiration
occasionally difficult, and accompa
nied by hiccough; cough sometimes
dry and convulsive; uneasy and dis
turbed sleep, with grinding of the

contemplated in the near future' a
completion of the New Orleans Pa
cific road.
M rOlarke state. with great frank
ness that he had been fatmiiar- with
the advantages of this connection
for two or three years, and that' his
recent inspection confirmed. -the
opinion that, the road bed, already
constructed, had been carefully pre
pared, especially with a view to.lda
clng it above the highest water ever
known in the country, and that it
penetrated a more fertile area than
any railroad, without exception, in
Louisiana.
A completion of the Vicksburg and
Shreveport road. running as it did
through a less fertile area, would not
make it a dangerous competitor.
The country traversed is susceptible
of producing a variety of products,
including wheat, corn, cotton, sugar
and tobacco, and is timbered with
many valuable woods, such as hard
pine, white oak, post oak, hickory,
and some poplar.
Concerning the disposition of cap.
italists to complete a road which
affords cultivators of the soil a speed
ily accessible market, Mr. Clarke
has repeatedly spoken to influential
gentlemen upon this subject. There
is no question whatever that capital
will always seek investment where
the security is certain, and where
the enterprise will command a large
profit. Capitalists who do. business
elpewhere dem mnd a largir return
for their investment th in' residents.
The improvement of property in New
Orleans, the increase in its volume of
trade and its columerral progro,s:
sre of nointerest whatever to them,,
unless they can profit by it.
When this matter i, broached to
Northern capitalists, they at once
and very naturally, suggest: "it
this be of so immense advantage to
New Orleans, why do not New Or
leans people take hold of it? It
their trade is to be increased and
their property improved, why do
they manifest no desire to secure
what, to a business man, would scorn
an absolute necessity ?"
To this pertinent query, M. Clarke
made the stereotyped reply, to be
heard upon the streets every day, and
will be rciterated for the next twew
ty years: "New Orleans merchants
and business men have no money."
To this the response was made,
that they had ,i, hey enough last
year to invest 1 ,1000,000 in U. 8.
four per cent bo . They had mo
uey enough to s up their places
of business, and end four months
of every summer a a Northern wa
terlng place. They can do business
sls months in the year and r."nin
idle the remainder. Our experience
tecohes us that six months labor for
either muscle or capit.il, is not
enough to pay a year's interest, and
we do not propose to risk our cap.
Ital upon any such terms.
A merchant of any prominence at
the North manages, six or eight
weeks every year, to secure a vaca
I won, but his business, which has
been thoroughly systematized goes
on uninterruptedly during hi ,ab
sehe. He can't afford to do other

as it knows anythlOg. We don't
