aroused a keen interest in this little

Rome. Price 50 cents.

THE SOUTH AND THE NEGRO.
An Unusually Fair Northern View.
We do not study the South
enough by leisurely visits off the
beaten track, away from the “Flori
da Special’’ and the tourist routes,
from which nothing of much value
can ever be learned. Our war preju
dices, the old distortion and blind
ness, are still overwhelming us, al
though we boast sometimes that we
have shaken them off.
I say this to myself every winter
as, returning from the quail and
snipe regions, I add new experiences
of appreciation. I stopped over this
time at Union Springs, in Alabama,
merely a cotton town far removed
from tourist lines. It is situated,
with wide, well-shaded streets, on a
good-sized hill, or ridge, with exten
sive views over a very curious region,
a sort of mottled country of pine for
ests and red-soiled cotton fields—a
paradise for sportsmen and followers
of the cunning quail, with high-bred
dogs wandering about the streets. I
sat on the steps of the courthouse
with my own dog, and talked with
one of the judges.
The field sports and their broaden
ing genial influence are perhaps the
best equipment for the serious task
of these Southern judges, the most
serious task that perhaps has ever
been given to their race. Union
Springs is in the midst of the black
belt, and the negroes outnumber the
whites ten to one. The white men
seemed to me like a band of broth
ers, united, disciplined, trained
through generations, like jovial sol
diers, to hold down the black race.
Their Southern qualities, that ex
treme and ready sociability, that
frank directness, seemed the more
intensified because they were so des
perately united to protect Anglo-
Saxon decency and order from being
overwhelmed by Africa.
The blacks, judging from those I
saw, may have been descended from
the last slaves imported just before
the trade was stopped. They seemed
very close to Africa. One of the
young men I went to see is a college
graduate, and a magistrate, who
seems to spend a large part of his
time trying negroes for all sorts of
misdemeanors. I watched another
young man in an office adjoining the
courthouse, with negro after negro,
male and female, coming before him;
they were waiting in groups before
the door, and he seemed to be lec
turing and explaining to them much
of the time. These negroes are not
the selected ones that we know, but
the great mass of the 10,000,000;
the 9,900,000 of the 10,000,000. It
will take a long time to lecture and
explain Anglo-Saxon ideas into the
black mass. It will never be done in
any time that can be estimated; and
yet the Southerner goes on with it
day after day, with the greatest pa
tience and good temper; he has been
going on with it in that way for gen
erations, and he will go on with it to
the end of time, while we theorize
and talk about it in the North.
I wonder where it will all end?
Will the Southerner continue to hold
down with one delicately moulded,
but iron hand, while he explains and
explains and shows great kindness
with the other hand; and meantime
the years and decades pass, and in
fifty years the present ten millions
of negroes have grown to twenty mil
lions, and in another fifty years to
forty millions, and so on until at last
there is a small white population, a
desperately united, high-strung band
of brothers, holding down an enor
mous black mass just as in India
about one hundred thousand Eng
lishmen hold down three hundred
millions of brown Asiatics. If that
day ever comes I feel as if there
should be painted somewhere in the
universe the scene I saw in the court
house; the slim young Southerner of
race-horse build, all nerve and sen
sation, the Anglo-Saxon type of the
Southern sun, explaining to black
man after black man; and he kept
on explaining and explaining through
the ages until the black man over
whelmed him with numbers. —Sidney

STICK TO THE OLD NAME
“POPULIST.”
*
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: —I know you are a very
busy man, but please take time to
give this poor letter some thought,
and publish it if you think it worth
space in your most noble Jefferson
ian. I am one of your readers and
have been ever since you began wri
ting, and that is ever since 1896. I
began with you then and have been
with you ever since.
Your troubles have been my trou
bles, and your fight has been mine,
and I can say, as one of old, “I have
kept the faith.” I am still on the
Ocala platform and shall remain
there until it is made clear to me
that I am wrong, and there is some
thing better, and that I do not ex
pect. I contend it contained every
thing that was necessary for the
masses and also for the classes.
Now I see some of the People’s
party men writing in your paper
about giving the party a new name.
This, I think, very uncalled for. We
have not met with defeat yet, though,
of course, we have failed to elect our
officers by being betrayed by a lot of
office hunters, and a lot of dema
gogues, but we have not lost a single
principle.
Now, true Jeffersonians, we are
just where we began the fight. Why
should we want a new name? I think
it more advisable for the Democrats
to find a new name than for the Pop
ulists.
I see some writing saying the word
Populist does not catch the people
like “Reform Democrat” would.
Oh, my! my! Let the people study
the two words and see which is the
oldest.
Get the derivatives of the two and
see what they mean.
This question is of minor impor
tance when it comes down to what
we need. We need reform much
more than we need a name, and there
are several political organizations in
America, all clamoring for reform
and the platforms, with some slight
difference, are the same. Why should
not these parties have a meeting,
come together, shake hands with
each other and declare for reform
and let the past be the past? Reform
legislation for the masses is what
we want, and not the classes. And
this is what we will have to do be
fore we will ever accomplish any
thing. It is conceded by all parties
that reform will never come through
either of the predominating parties.
Then, as true American citizens, why
not come together and fight them?
Yours for reform,
W. W. SMITH, M. D.
