OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
In “The Junior Jeffs ’, which is the
young folks’ department of Watson’s
Magazine, we said: “Please mark
your letters plainly on the first
page: “Junior Jeffs” or “Our Post-
Card Club’’. If you wrote to the
Magazine at any time, and have not
seen your letter in print, don’t jump
to the conclusion that it went in the
waste-basket, but look in the Week
ly Jeffersonian. On the other hand,
some letters that we have published
in the Magazine may have been in
tended for the Weekly. If so, we
apologize, and you must do the rest
—be good, and mark your letters
plainly."
EARNED THE MONEY HERSELF.
Here is a letter which was pub
lished in the August number of our
Magazine, and we reprint it here, be
cause it contains so bright an object
lesson for all our young friends:
Dear Daddy Jim: —I am a little
girl, eight years old. I am taking
music, and I hope to be a music
teacher some day. I have only been
taking music three months, and I
have paid for it myself by getting
subscriptions to the Jeffersonians. I
hope to make as good a woman as
Tom Watson is a man, and as good a
music teacher as my teacher, Miss
Rosa. —Gussie Lee Aaron, Lyons, Ga.
If you will drop us a postal card,
we will be glad to send you samples
and instructions, and start you out.
There is not a single boy or girl
among you, who cannot make from
one dollar to five dollars a week by
taking subscriptions for the Jeffer
sonians, selling magazines and books,
and doing other work for us. Here
is your opportunity. Such a start
may lay the foundation of your suc
cess in life. Your indifference or
neglect may spell the secret of a
life’s failure.
AN EXPRESSION TEACHER.
I want to be an expression teach
er, and want my pupils to love and
obey me, so that they can make good
speeches for the people. I want to
be a good Christian woman, and
teach little children to love and obey
Jesus. I like to read the Jefferson
ian, and I think Mr. Watson is try
ing to teach the people the truth. —
Gladys Norman, 11 years old, Clax
ton, Ga.
LIKES HER SCHOOL.
I am a little Georgia girl, 10 years
old. I live four miles in the coun
try. My home is on a high hill, sur
rounded by a beautiful oak grove. I
go to school, and am in the fourth
grade. I like to go to school. My
teacher is Mr. Searcy. I will be sor
ry when school is out; I will miss my
playmates so much. My uncle takes
the Jeffersonian, and we all enjoy
reading it. —Blanche Baker , R. F.
D., Thomasville, Ga.
A LITTLE GEORGIA CRACKER.
Here comes a little Georgia Crack
er to join your happy band. Grand
pa takes the Jeffersonian, and I like
to read the letters. I live eight
miles from town, out on a farm. I
like farm work fine, for there are so
Jeffersonian
many things raised on a farm that
are just delicious to eat. I am 14
years of age. I have one sister and
two brothers. The letters were all
good on “What I Hope to Be”. As
my letter is getting lengthy, and I
just know the old waste-basket is
gaping for it, I will close by asking
a riddle: “Big at both ends, and lit
tle in the middle; digs up dirt, and
plays like a fiddle.”—Alford Gruber,
R. F. D. 2, Baxley, Ga.
EXAMPLE AND PRECEPT.
Once a little boy went to his un
cle’s for dinner, and while there he
took a biscuit with his fork. When
he went home he told his mother
about it, and she said: “Why, Tom
mie, didn’t you know better than
that?’’ “No’m,” he replied, “for at
home we just say, ‘Hand me a bis
cuit,’ and Pa pitches them to us.”—
Marvin Rousey, R. F. D. 2, Lincoln
ton, Ga.
FROM HER BROTHER.
I see so many letters about boys
and girls, I thought I would write
one. I will not compliment one let
ter, but they are all splendid. I
thank Mr. Tom Watson very much
for giving us children a chance to
write. I like boys and girls both,
because it is human nature for us to
love one another. I think girls are
very, very nice in their place, and a
boy the same way. If you put a boy
to cooking he is not much good, and
if you put a girl to plowing she can’t
do much at it. So you see one was
put here for one thing and one
for another. So a boy must not ex
pect a girl to go to the field and do
the same work he does, and a girl
must not think a boy can cook good.
Say, boys and girls, let’s love one an
other and take Mr. Watson’s space
he is giving us and strive to get an
education, for that is a fine thing to
have. All of you members, send me
a post-card.—Jesse Whatley, 15
years old, R. F. D. 2, Ashland, Texas.
