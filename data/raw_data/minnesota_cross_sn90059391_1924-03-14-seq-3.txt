May Look for Lost Treasure
Buried in Northern lowa By
Survivor of Custer Massacre
MASON CITY, IA., March 10.—
There is considerable speculation
among the old settlers here as to
whether the Thomas Nelson, recently
reported dead in Alaska, is the same
Thomas Nelson who buried a fortune
of $500,000 in gold coin somewhere
in Worth or Cerro Gordo county 40
years ago. He left here in 1897 to
join the Klondike rush and has never
been heard from since.
There are many living near here
who remember Nelson intimately.
They believe there is treasure buried
somewhere in the upper Lime Creek
valley, probably on the old Wheeler
ranch near Wheelerwood.
Thomas Nelson was a man with a
history that read like a romance. He
was a man of mystery, a grizzly
giant towering six feet with hair
sweeping to his shoulders. There
had been tragedy in his life ,a great
wrong or hurt, of which he never
spoke.
A native of Connecticut, Nelson
worked west in quest of gold in 1871.
He landed in the Little Big Horn
country prior to the discovery of the
yellow metal in the Black Hills.

IXMiRA S
height, Nelson fell in with a small
detachment of Custer’s men and for
a time was engaged in conveying
wagon trains through dangerous ter
ritory.
When Custer made his last stand in
the basin of the Little Big Horn, Nel
son was within earshot of the battle.
All that fatal day, the adventurer,
whose gold is believed to be buried
in lowa soil, watched the ebb and
flow of the battle tide from an em
inence overlooking the bloody basin
in which was staged the most thrill
ing, wild and savage drama ever
enacted in the history of the west.
After the battle was ended he was
five days in finding his way back to
safety in the breaks of the bad
lands. During the five days he was
without drink or food, save the
slight nournishment derived from
chewing the buckskin fringe of his
coat, and eating his rawhide shoe
strings. He alone escaped out of the
death trap in the Little Big Horn—
the sole survivor of Custer’s last
campaign.
During the mad and lawless days
—days of gold in the Black Hills, he
became a prospector and a miner in
the camps at Lead and Gayville. He
was credited with having amassed a
fortune of $500,000. This is believed
to be buried in lowa.
In the summer of 1884, ten years
after the discovery of the gold in the
Black Hills, a stranger called at the
Wheeler ranch near Wheelerwood,
Cerro Gordo county. He was not an
old man, but his hair was white as
snow. He obtained work on the
place and remained all summer . He
gave his name as Thomas Nelson and
explained that he was from the
west. The late Charles Van Note was
in charge of the ranch at that time.
His son, R. M. Van Note, iB now a
resident of Fertile, a few miles from
Mason City. He recalls the days
when Nelson worked for his father.
He remembers that he always car
ried a revolver,” said Mr. Van Note,
“and people said he was a miner from
the west. One day a neighbor came
to the farm and found him in the
barn counting gold coins. He had
the money stacked up in a high
pile.
‘Then he put the money all back
in heavy bags and fastened them to
a leather belt. It was rumored about
that he kept his money buried some
where on the ranch. A year or two
later it spread about that he was un
able to find his buried money. He
remained in Cerro Gordo county for
10 or 15 years and spent most of his
time on Lime creek, traveling up and
down the stream. He joined the
Klondike rush in 1897 and was neve
heard of again.”

Respect for Law
Is Greatest Heed,
of Present Time
MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., March 10.
- Respect for established law is the
greatest need in America, District
Judge H. D. Dickinson told eight
women and 13 men, members of the
March grand jury, today, in charg
ing them that “your work should be
faithfully and scrupulously perform
ed. with a zealousness that is propor
tionate to the needs of the hour.”
“What the land needs is more res
pect for the law,” Judge Dickinson
tokl the jurors. “If a law is bad, if it
is a law that public opinion will not
support, then let the public change
it. No law can stand for long that
is not supported by the public. But
whether a law is supported or not, it
is an expression of public opinion as
lone as it stands on the books. We
must have respect for the law, or we
can’t have much of anything.”
Judge Dickinson urged jurors par
ticularly to “beware of any attempt
to use your body for political or par
tisan purposes.”
THE FIERY CROSS
MAKE IOWA BIBLE
BILL STATE LAW
SAY CLUB WOMEN
Endorse Measure at Board
Meeting of Federation
of Women’s Clubs
RESOLUTION ADOPTED
Custom Has Removed Holy Writ
From School Room and Not
Law, It Is Said
Sentiment in favor of the passage
of the compulsory Bible reading bill
by the lowa state legislature is gain
ing ground in many quarters.
Last Thursday, 200 members of the
lowa Federation of Women’s Clubs,
gathered in Des Moines at a board
meeting unanimously adopted a re
solution calling upon the state legis
lature to enact the bill into law.
Will Hare Influence
It is believed that the stand of
the women's organization will carry
much wait with lowa solons, for the
extent of the Federation is wide
spread in both the urban and rural
sections of the Hawkeye state.
Mrs. Flora E. S. Barkley of Boone,
chairman of the federation’s Biblical
literature committee, fratned the re
solution which was presented to the
board members by Mrs. W. W. Lit
tell, of Des Moines. Mrs. H. W.
Spaulding, of Grinnell and Mrs.
George Harnagel, of Des Moines, sec
onded the resolution.
Text of Resolution
The text of the resolution is as
follows:
“Whereas, the lowa law providing
that the Bible must not be barred
from public schools, has not been
changed in the past sixty years, cus
tom has virtually removed it from
the school room;
“Whereas, the Bible is not only our
greatest teacher of morals, and con
tains the greatest code of ethics
known; but is also the world’s treas
ury of literature;
“Therefore, be it resolved that the
board and committees of the lowa
Federation of Women’s Clubs here
assembled, representing more than
40,000 women, favor the bill requir
ing the daily reading of selected por
tions of the Bible, without comment,
in the public schools of lowa.
“And concurring with the National
Education asociation in the follow
ing: ‘We do not do this in the inter
est of sectarian Instruction of any
kind, but that this real book may
ever be the teacher's aid in the in
terpretations of history, literature,
law and life —an unrivalled agency
in the development of true citizen
ship, as well as in the formation of
pure literary style.’ ”
Thy People Shall
Be My People
(Northwest Christian Advocate)
“Whither thou goest I will go; and
whither thou lodgest I will lodge;
thy people shall be my people, and
thy God my God.” There is one re
flection growing out of a study of the
story of Ruth so recently brought to
the attention of the church through
the Sunday school lesson. We call at
tention to the pledge of loyalty by
Ruth, not only to her mother-in-law,,
Deborah, but to the laws and religion ‘
of the people among whom she was
going as an immigrant to take up her
abode. ‘Thy people shall be my peo
ple.” It is the only policy Ruth could
have framed «nd adhered to, arid lived
in the peace and happiness that was
hers. The story of that beautiful
life, that harmonious adjustment,
that produoed domestic and national
felicity and strength, is erne of the
most beautiful and inspiring episodes
of ancient history.
Ruth might have thought herself
justified had she packed up her Mo
abitish gods and continued their Wor
ship among the Jehovah worshipers
of Israel. She might have intro
duced her foreign manners and cus
toms and insisted upon the recogni
tion of these by the people among
whom she had settled. But she relin
quished all these in the interest of a
larger harmony. Had she claimed
her rights, the beautiful book of
Ruth would never have been written,
or, at best, it would have furnished
a sordid reeord in the history of Is
rael instead of its most idyllic chap
ter.
The story has its modern applica
tion in the United States in the light
of the serious problems of a polyglot
people whose slightest thought is in
pledging that America’s people shall
be their people and America’s cus
toms shall be their customs. The
pledge of citizenship means in a great
number of cases little more than liv
ing barely within the law, and with
certain national groups to disregard
the laws and customs of the land. We
hear much of late about occupational
blocs formed for selfish ends. These
blocs have their representatives at
Washington for legislative purposes.
It is a dangerous tendency for a na
tion to divide into hostile groups with
the hand of each turned against all
the others.
One thousand students of the
American Methodist Episcopal
church will meet Aug. IH, 19 and 20
at Louisville, Ky„ to discuss the
program of the Methodist church and
the relation of that program to the
Christian world task. The entire
program of this meeting will be in
the hands of students; students have
arranged the topics for discussion,
student speakers will make the chief
addresses and there will be student
discussion from the floor of the as

Public Opinion on Current Topics
As Reflected in lowa Newspapers
Herewith are extract** from edltorli
newspapers reflecting Hawkeje puhll
points on subjects of Interest to all
publication does not mean that The I
the views expressed.
RELIGION IN SCHOOLS
(Marshalltown Times-Republican)
New York is struggling with the
problem of religious teaching in the
schools. lowa is considering the
absolutism of Bible reading os part
of the daily school program.
The fact is that educational load
ers are aroused to the necessity of in
struction in religion and spiritual
matters. The material has over
whelmed the spiritual in the educa
tional system. We have become so
materialistic and individualistic that
we are falling off to an alarming ex
tent in that citizenship which in
cludes the nation and the state with
the individual and. the class. • * *
The situation in New York city is
of course different from the lowa sit
uation only in the number of com
municants to the differing creeds.
Jews and Catholics are in larger
numbers there, though perhaps ac
cording to population no more Cath
olics, but certainly more Jews. The
vital point iri the whole matter
whether in New York or in lowa, is
to preserve the right to worship and
religious study according to con
science and faith and not to force a
study upon the children of the com
mon schools that shall take on the
appearance of interference with
creed or faith of the children so con
cerned.
However, considered as a mere
classic and not as a work inspired of
God. the Bible is one of the greatest
literary accomplishments of the ages.
It deserves to be studied by all creeds
and all students. The main thing is
to avoid even the appearance of
force and intolerance in the schools.
MOVIE CONTROL
(The Burlington Hawk-Eye)
The churches and reform agencies
which are urging federal control ,of
moving pictures have very good in
tentions in the matter. In their
opinion a federal commission of sev
en members, with certain powers
conferred by congress, could regulate
and improve a number of existing
faults in the movie industry.
The work of the commission would
be to inspect and license films for
inter-state and foreign commerce.
Although it would not require sub
mission of all films for license, it
would prohibit the carriage and
transportation between states, or the
exportation to and importation from
a foreign country, of any unlicensed
film.
The plan seems sound in many
ways; yet the public can’t get away
from the idea that having pictures,
like books and plays, are things
which should be regulated by normal
standards of decency and art, and by
educated public opinion rather than
by censorship boards or commissions.
It has been said that the moving
picture industry, after making a no
ble effort at self-reform, gave up the
effort, and that its National Board of
Censors and its thirteen national
standards for producers are meaning
less. It is also generally believed
that the system of distributing and
exhibiting pictures is not so fair to
theater managers and public as it
should be.
In spite of all these deplorable
facts— if they really are facts—it
must be admitted that pictures are
getting better. In the past year or
two there have been a few notable
productions which have come very
tJose to satisfying the critical de
mands of good taste, art, drama and
pictorial beauty. Producers have
worked hard to hring out something
really fine .and the public has re
sponded with enthusiastic approval.
It seems likely that in the long run
this sort of control will do far more
to elevate moving pictures than will
the most carefully devised system in
volving control by a small group of
authorized censtas'.
THE NEW IMMIGRATION BILL
(The Dally Times Davenport)
The immigration bill lately placed
on the house calendar has not only
political complications, but threatens
foreign involvements as well. The
“hot stuff” which has come out of
the sennte committee’s probe of the
oil leases has minimized the news
space ordinarily given to the routine
proceedings of congress.
The new immigration restrictive
measure will be widely discussed both
in the national legislative assembly
and throughout the country before it
is enacted. Not a little opposition
may be expected to develop to it. *
Everyone will recognize that any
people have the privilege of deter
mining who shall De admitted as po
tential citizens, but whatever condi
tions are imposed should concern the
fitness of those who would take up
their habitation here. The test should
be applied in their own land and
seek to establish their qualifications
to become good citizens here, irre
spective of their race or creed. No
other policy will square with our pro
fessions of equality or the fundamen
tal principles of American govern
ment. • • •.
The new feature which is certain
to bring protests from Japan, is that
which closes the gates to those races
that are ineligible to citizenship. De
spite the so-called gentlemen’s agree
ment, thousands of Japs find their
way into this country clandestinely
each year. All subjects of the mika
do would be placed on the basis of
total exclusion, as are the Chinese,
which the proud Japanese must find
most objectionable.
The suggestion of Secretary Hughes
that the Jap be put under the quota
plan, is deserving of incorporation in
the law, for it would eliminate this
particular discrimination while plac

INVESTIGATING .MUNI Cl PA L
CANDIDATES
(Burlington Hawk-Eye)
While many citizens who insist that
Burlington shall always have the best
of everything, have high hopes that
the City or Business Manager plan
will carry at the March elections, it
would indeed be a misfortune if their
confidence would make them neglect
their plain duty of picking the very
best men possible for mayor and
councilmen at that time.
The history of the business man
ager plan has been that it has gen
erally met defeat at the polls the
first time it has been put before the
voters. It is such a decided depart
ure, this thing of putting modern
business methods into the city gov
ernment, from what the public has
become familial with that there are
always many good citizens who are
disinclined to make the change. Even
*ome of those who most bitterly op-
Ijosed changing from the old “feder
al system” to the commission plan,
now admit that they were in error.
But they fought that change, and
may be counted upon to fight this
change. Added to these are soni*''
who, for selfish reasons, object to
seeing the business management plan
put into effect, and they with tneir
followers and other beneficiaries of
the present system, will undoubtedly
make a very formidable opposition
on March 31st.
It therefore behooves every good
citizen, whether or not he favors the
new plan, to carefully examine into
the character and qualifications of
the men who offer themselves as can
didates for the five elective offices,
mavor and councilmen.
Remember, that these men. if
elected and no change is made from
the present system, will have control
of tne biggest business in the city,
the city itself. Upon them will de
pend, to a great extent, what your
taxes will be, what your special as
sessments will be, what influence will
be thrown about your boys and girls,
what encouragement will be given to
strangers to come to Burlington to
make their homes. They will have
the spending of your money and the
enforcement of your laws. Other cit
ies and other citizens will know you
through them and form their opin
ions of you and of your city through
the acts of these men you select and
entrust with your affairs.
None Stir But the Guilty
—The Power of
Suggestion
LOST CREEK. W. VA.. March 10.
—Boy, fetch us a reinforced can
teen; and if you have any doubts
as to the power of suggestion, lis
ten to this:
An electric train bound from
Clarksburg to Weston, was speed
ing swiftly on its way. Seat
ed comfortably on one of the large
seats was a man sleeping peace
fully. Beside him was a woman
with a baby in her arms, and be
tween them on the seat was a
nursing bottle. When about to
alight from the car at one of the
stations the woman discovered
that she had forgotten the bottle
and started back after it.
A man sitting near the dozing
passenger said to him in a de
manding voice: “Hand me that
bottle.” The man awoke startled
and clawed furiously at the win
dow lock with one hand and wig
gled at his hip pocket with the
other. There was a crash of glass
and a ding -a pint flask broke to
atoms on the hard ground.
The now wide-awake man did
not join in the laughter that fol
lowed the incident. The car was
far away from the scene of the
“accident” before he .ventured to
remark: “I thought we never
would leave that station.”
An expedition left England during
last October to film the life and work
of the missionary explorer, David
Livingstone. Reports from Central
Africa indicate that the party has
reached Victoria Falls after some
thrilling adventures enroute.

KlanswomenDenied
Right of Attending
Funeral of Member
CLARKSBURG, W. VA„ March 10.
—A precedent was established hera
today when the Rev. Charles E. Sta
ter, pastor of the First Methodist
Episcopal church, of this city, refus
ed the Women of the Ku Klux Klan
the privilege of attending a funeral
service in the church.
This is the first time in the history
of West Virginia that any branch of
the Klan has been denied the privi
leg** of attending a Protestant insti
tution, it is said.
Mrs. W. B. Darling, 38 Ash street,
who had been a member of the
church many months prior to the
Rev. Mr. Stater’s advent and who
died a few days ago asked that she
be given a Klan funeral. She was a
member of the Women of the Ku
Klux Klan.
A representative of the women’s
organization called the Rev. Mr. Sta
ler over the telephone and asked him
if the women’s order might use the
basement of the church to robe in
prior to the funeral.
In reply to this the minister is
said to have stated that he “would
rather that the women would not
come into the church robed.” When
interviewed by a correspondent for
this newspaper the Rev. Stater said
that he did not refuse the women on
account of them being Klanswomen,
but on account of them wearing
masks. According to the women’s
representative nothing was said
about wearing masks. The Rev. Mr.
Stater further told the writer that
the matter was a personal one be
tween him, the minister, and the wo
men and that he would rather that
there would not be anything said
about it in the papers. In connec
tion with this it might be said that
a robed choir furnishes the music at
the First Methodist Episcopal church.
Funeral services were held over
the body of the late Mr*. Darling at
the First Methodist Episcopal church
Sunday afternoon at 2 o’clock. The
Rev. Charles G. Slater was in charge.
Following the services at the
church the body was taken to the
Masonic cemetery where the Women
of the Ku Klux Klan took charge
and where the customary Klan bur
ial ceremony was carried out. About
4(H) robed women were present at the
grave.
The Young Women’s Christian As
sociation has launched a nation-wide
campaign for $250,000 with which to
re-establish the work for the girl*
and women of Japan. Makeshift bar
racks and inadequate equipment
since the earthquake have greatly
curtailed the activities of this organ
ization in Japan.
