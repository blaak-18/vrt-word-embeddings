tract; but the disgrace lies with the
Republican party for attempting to
steal that much of the people's money
and it shall be made to bear it. If
you construe the organization) of the
white people of this parish to resist
the further advance of your party, in
the destruction of their liberties, and
the confiscation of their property, into
'a movement to array one race against
another, and "you cannot see it iln
any other light," so be it. For we
construe that into just this, and noth
ing less. You and your party, being
all colored in its voting strength, are
determined to give us just such rule
as we have had ; to continue to plun
der jllst as we have been plundered,
and we attempt to organize to resist;
that movement will be declared by
you to be a desire on our part to bring
the two races into direct conflict. We
can see your "statement in no other
light," and such being the case we
emphatically say, let it come. We are
prepared to "assume the resposibili
ty," no matter how "grave." We
will "bear the load" cheerfully, and
we desire not, the "envy even, of so
,lausible a gentleman? as the editor of
the !Lepublicant.
As far as the payment of the mileage
and per diem to the members of the
McEncry Legislatuire is concerned, we
must say that the oposition comes to
late ; yoe should have thought of that
before you paid them ; and remember
that, although the payment Was a
dangerous "precident," was wrong,
still it was made by Republicans to
Democrats i and while upon the sub
ject, we could suggest that if your leg
islature had desired to have (lone the
legal and just thing-to have fulfiled
the wishes of the tax payers, they
should have then given seats to the
members of the McEnery Legislature
whio were certainly entitled to them.
"The people will bear in mind that
the tax collectors in seizing property
on the delinquent tax, do so at the
special instance of the Auditor, and
inuseizing for back taxes, the taxes for
187t1 must be included or be lost. The
withholding of the back taxes is not
within his discretion. To relieve the
pIople of taxes it does not require
mass meetings and passionate speech
es, for if any taxpayer will call on
the collector and ask for time we
guarantee he will give him ample
-time if lie is unable to pay the taxes
now. The tax collector does not put
the estimation of the valuation on the
property on the tableau, The meet
ing represented the only onerous tax,
and thatfact should not have been
ovelinoked.
We contend that the tax collector
Shars not followed out the spirit of his
instructions, and we have private let
ters from the Auditor before us that
simply state that our interpretation
of his order is correct, low could a
person who is unable to pay the taxes
of 1873 uponhis property now, pay
the delinquent taxes of 70, '71, or '72.
Such an idea is simply preposterous.
The Auditor saoys "don't press the
people who are willing but unable to
ipay until fall, when they will have
means by the sale of their crops"
this is plain of course. No mention is
tmade with regard to delinquent taxes
4ecause the Auditor naturally sup
posed a person that could not pay
all, could not pay any. But the col
clector saw a small loophole to work
his "erushing process" through, and
be iimediately begins "to warm the
war in our ehit." The judgmentl
crlitors from one side, are not pres- (
sing us, and we venture to say they t
are willisng to go farther in the way
of namtmuenit relief for the tax payers t
than any man in, or in fact the whole i
lRepublican party. r
We think we can discern the mean
ing of the meeting, and we advise all
good and law-abiding citizens not to
pIrecipitate themselves into any move
nlent that would tend to violate and
defy thelaws. .Violentand indiscreet
speeches brought on the last war, and a
those who made them and should have
been in the front, were often found
to be in some snug position, or were
exempt On account of their property.
The consequence'was that the poorer Â¶
class of citizens had to bear the whole
load, and their property destroyed.
Such was the the last war, and we
hope that we may not see a repetition t
of IL. This thins of arraying one class t1
against another is a serious business;
it is contrary tolaw ; it is defying the
law. A mind ijs.that condition needs b
repose and reIlection-serious reflec
tion befor action, because it con
trollthe man, and not the man the
mind. We hope we bnay be wrong in
what we think we discern, becausne it
otherwise ouoa State would be forever
ruined, Remain at your peaceful
hohies aid attend to your peaceful
avoeatitons surrounded by your fa
mily and your friends. Allow no one ol
to tamper with the hlapiness of your
selfand family. If yeou need relief
from taxatbn the government and 'a
the paisih will grant it, but am you th
valune your peace and happiness dot
not resort to violence to force a thing
that wouldl be accorded to you on mere
application. Olffice is the foundation a
of all politieal disputes, and I know in
that the farmer does not desire to "
Sheap trouble upon himself for the ad
vancement of any person to office, uIn
the South each race is dependent on W
the other, neither can successfully m
thrive without the aissiptance of the n
io other."
to We venture to say that the above
y extract contains more "buncomb," and
If is full of more little sly hints and
1e threats than any thing of its heft our
st readers ever before read. "The guil
*n ty heart quakes'at the first (sound of
A alarm." The person that penned those
to lines we know must be'a fatherlylman.
At See with what,care he would have us
in conduct ourselves, and with what
Te gentle admonition he chides us to
t- obey his advice-"to remain quietly
ig at our homes." We might ruin the
re State if we attempt to resist his party,
le Bali! This reminds us more of the
s- tory of the oldm:nan whose son John
d, nie slept up stairs at the old home
; stead. Johnnie, like all boys, had a
)y habit of oversleeping himself, which
ig lie indulged in whenever opportunity
e presented. One morning, rather late,
Br the old man called from the foot of
re the stairs to his sleeping son: "John
o nie, my son, come, get up, get up, and I
,- look at the beautiful sky, see the sun
e rise my boy, listen to the sweet birds
d singing their morning hymns to their
o G-d almighty d-n your hide if you 1
1f aint down here in five minutes I'll 1
break every bone in your carcass."
e "We don't hold that all of the offices a
e held by Republicans are competently 11
filled, yet that is not the fault of the (l
e Republican party. The men who pro- a
o fess to have all the brains do no feel
t disposed to affiliate with them, hence
r the party does its best. But we ex
pect all kind of abuse from the l)e
mocratic party ; it has a chronic af- 1
h fection for quarreling. It practiced
o on the political body of the old Whig c
- party and abused that out of exist- tl
once, and then angered because it did c
not exist longer so as to continue to t,
B "pitch in" while it was "spoiling for a n
1 quarrel." In politics abuse is a ne
cessary ingredient. The politician
without that quality is a mere novice. n
And it requires a man of an even
balanced mind to stand the trouble i'
and worry of politics." si
t Well now that is an admission we h
r never expected you to make, "that all 61
the offices are not properly filled that ii
r are held by Republicans," but the joke ct
comes in when you blame us for that' p
t How many of your sins do you intend P
to impose upon us any way f How
can any decent man remain with you n
or join you for any purpose, wJlcn
your whole party foundation stone is
office and spoils-your oaths binding
the nmembers of your party to vote tl
the ticket, right or wrong, competent o'
or incompetent to fill the position,
you mutst support the c',ndidate nom
inted. Old father Whlitehead, how r
do you expect any honest or respect- .
able man to affiliate with you when c
hlie will be bound up in such a way as
that ? No ! no! You have also made i
a probation clause, as far as holding
office is concerned; efthree and four
years, that in itself completely bars off w
all honest men that may join you for f
four years at least. The fact of its r
"requiring a man of even-balanced ft
mind to stand the worry and troubles b
of politics," can be aptly demonstrat- Ii
ed without going far from our city. ri
It must give the radical "pap suckers" p1
in our midst "trouble" to pulblicly
Ssteal from us and then face us with
open hands and smiling lips, like the
"fawning publican," and one other M
thing we notice the "balance" is gen- D
erally pretty even on their side also. j
"Tihe people generally are disposed J.
to be law-abiding unless advantage is A
taken of their necessities for the pur- 1H
pose ofinflaming tlfeir minds on ac- J.
count of that necessity. The laws of J.
the land must be respected, and they Jr
will be, or the government will be a ),
mere ball to be tossed about by every 8.
dissappointed politician. Have res- J.
pect for the law-obey the law-for A.
resistance to it leads to riot, revolu- B,
tion, anarchy and despotism. Some R.
people will not let good enough alone E
-never satisfied, and you will find A.
in many instances, that those who are J.
loudest in proclaiming to protect the W
people from high taxation, and tell J.
about the people's wrongs, that the Jn
people pay too great taxes, do ziot C.
pay one cent of tax; You recollect V.
that the greatest and most terrific N.
fought battles during the last war, J.
were fought with a stick, in the sand. W
There the warrior would take posi- Cl
tion, plait the campaign, flank the J.
Yankees at every turn, and finally iJ.
mark out a botomless lake and drive T.
the Yankees into it, and capture both H.
them and the lake. But you must M.
mind, the warriors remained at home! IR.
Yet for all that, they fought more
battles, and gained more victories -
than Gen. Lee did. "Sloh ist ife."n
We hope the people will receive
tihe relief they ask for from the Audi- da'
tor, and we feel assured they will, if TF
they make thbir complaint in prop
er shape. We will refer to this sub
ject again." Ti
Now we propose to give the writer
of that article a little friendly advice
by way of a moral, and as soldierly
advice, coming from one who fought
the enemy in the fields of Virginia,
not in "the sand with a crooked stick;
that is this, thas all such advice as his
might go a long ways with the "Mar
ines" but is utterly wasted upon the F
"old Sailors." We don't propose to
take the war experience of any one p
wvhosb time was spent in measuring
meal or butchering beef for the army;
nor do we wish the opinion of any J
one, as to who fought the battle of
ve the war and who did not; who in
ud trenched himself during the late un
id pleasantness behind a certificate of in
or sanity. Neither of the parties smelled
il- any thing like powder during the war,
of and if they did, it was not blolod.

Dear Growler :
I Please give me your opinion about
certain persons who make it a part of
their duty, when visiting friends, to
I circulate false rumors, calculated only
to injure the reputation of our young
a meIn.
Yours, CONSTANCY.
Our opinion on this question can- I
not be forled freely, upon so little
information as that contained in 'Con"
stancys' note. We are not informed
how "our young men" conduct them- j
I selves when "visiting friends." Not I
t in such a manner, we hope, as to in
cur the necessity of "circulating re
ports." Friend, never circulat.o e
I ports calculated to injure any one,
and our advice would be that you
never call again when reports are li- F
able to injure you.
Dtat Growler:
I send you a return and the fate of
the party summoned, what think you
of it:
Received on June 18th, 1874, and
on same day of same month and year,
executed the within writ of attach
meant by attaching the within niamed

Observer, we simply "observe" that
we are not at all astonished at the
fairte of the return., Ils Honor don't
ireturn anything if he can keep it, and I
Sfrom his conduct heretofore, we have
begun to regard himn as a perfect po
