If the advocatees of the state credit
and the state debt were as happy in o se
conelusion as they are laying down sam
premises their arguments would com- Cali
mand, at least, decent attention. As col
it is, however, the public cry for hith
light on the political question-and a are
public debt, is that-which now ab cnel
erbs the public mind is only quick- Inte
eard by the drivel doled out to it by the
the defenders and attorneys of the fell
**Boeded Debt." We bhave never had the
that Idolatrous veneration for rtate and

well messing men. Oar obervation T

It is useless, however, to reason on onme
this question. Our view at the subo evi

Planters in this section report that
some uneasinese hs been noticed pul
among certain negroes in certain lo. Ti
calities. We are informed that those me
colored men over whom Blunt has aid
hitherto exercised vast influence the
are the leaders in tLis attempt to joG
coerse the planter into allowing his In
interests and property used to suit 00o
the whims of the employed. These or
fellows have gone so far as to sy thu
they will work only as they choose of
sad have in a few instances refused the
to work at all.
The sentimeat of our people, so far 2
as we have cnversed with them, is ter
fnsed na opposition to )elding to the do
insane demands of these clamorous I
tramps. Thoy are the bes paid laIs
borers n America; their rights e tar
in no way interfered with; their was. -I

had better disabuse their minds at iis
once of such ano idea.
Happily, but a small portion can be de
seriously efected by such a wild s
scheme as this "Kansas Emigrationo, jo
and those are the worthless and In.
cendiary bummers of the element.
The best colored people are more
contented, better satisfied, more ne

'they will be vastly benefitted by the mi

the other, which does not find those

In fact, they have become so notori- to
ous as the champions of every tihing Il

that they are a stink in the nostrils
of nine-tenths of the Democrats of r
the State. p
True to their former relations, the C
flue and Piesytue, aided (1) the ast-.
tempt to defeat the call for a Coastit"' I
tional Convention, and falling 1b that as
have (2) eserted all their nfluencse to at
render the efforts of that body to af- ,
ford substantial relief to the ta pay- ill
ing ctisen abortive. Thie result shows d
them completely beaten on ill the
questions at :ane. Tihe Convention
was called despite their furious oppos as
ition, and the people have succeeded er
in electing a vast majority -'f the W
delegates in their interest notwith
standing the malevolence of those si
journals. la
The limse now "pipes down" to tll
"nimbly capering" over the thread- to
worn story of a dishonored State and of
a ruined people - dislonored and and. li
ilad if the fraudulent debt is in any
manner disturbed; while the Pica. .,
IaNN plaintively pleads with the ro- al
ral delegates to visit New Orleans
days before the Convention asaem N
bles to "confer with the banker and it
capitalist;" who, in the opinion of it
the Picayune, know more of the ca- p
pabilities of the people to pay than
they do themselves. The Democrat b
very properly puts this "early visit', t
in its proper light when it says, in
substance, that it is for the purpose ,
of corrupting such members as e~sn
be "influenced" in the "interest" of ,
tihe bondholder.
In our opinion, the invitation of
the Picalune. and the late pulling eof
fort of the Times, are but the mimb-I a
lings of disgruntled, defeated and ci
digeusted agents, and indicate that
the people have ae again vanquished
their foes.

We hope the Democratic party will

The Observer, a Republican sheet
published in New Oileans has the
following to say in relation to the M
"exodus" of the negroes to Kansas :

contribute to the feeling that, out of fi
this abject and crushed condition, 1:
anywhere is preferable wherein is
guasrasted the boon of American citi.
senship, as understood and appreci
ated in the free States. After a con
sultation in this city of colored min
isters, men of positive, though quiet,
inlurence among the colored people it 1
determined to cnll a convention to be
held in New Orleans on or about the
ISlh of April, to be -omposed of del

have sway in this State we be;ieve
this proposed convention of the col

of thiscommunity. In any event it
dictate a policy and direct author
itavely a course for the entire body of
the colored citizens hIere and we, as
sume, which will serve the rights of
all."
Has the .Obserrer followed out the
North Louisiana "lawlessness" which I
it charges upon our peop le, and does 1
Sit not know that gentlemen from this
parish and Caddo were tried before its
own courts, upon perjured evidence,
by a test oath jury and acquitted of
these very charges.
So long as the material citizen subh
mitted to the rapacious and brutal
rule of the negro IIi '-attributes of
freedom" were considered safe, but
when intelligence would no longer
submit to the thraldom of ignorance 1
and vice a howl goes up that "free
I citizenship" Is struck down.
We have been afflicted suffilcient
ly long with this cant. The radicals
of Louisiana deserve all the freezing
" out they get, and more. Their ten
Ryears of infamous grinding, tobbery
and malevolence has dried up the
I fountatin of mercy in out hearts and
, their wail falls on earn deafened to
Y their cries by me mories of their hor
r rible deeds.

SThe attempt to distort this meeting
Sofowardly hkseaburners like Blunt
into a eonelave of '"minists' is
absat as rich a piece of gush as we
ever read. Paramn Blnt and his
Sfellows are about on a par, and the

their advice, and follows out thIe pol

aged 65 years.
We lose in him the type of the noble
old citizen and of the good old christian
man. All those who have ever availed
themselves of his hospitality, have treas.
ured the remembrance of the kind and
generous way in which it was extended
to them, and they will always remember
with pleasure the bright and happy
home it was their good fortune to see.
Devoted husband, most loving father,
kind and anselish fried, most amiable
to all, it was Impossible that his home
should be anything but happy.
The last years of his life were embiter.
edt by the l sof a loving and well be
loved daughter, by his ard health, and
alsoby businaes troubles, but notwith.
stading all his trials, his kind and ge.
nial milq never deserted him.
