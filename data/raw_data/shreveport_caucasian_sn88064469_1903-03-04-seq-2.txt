TABLE AND TOILET WARE,.
P.iakieable Metals - New WrInkles
. I the Dinner Service.
One of the marked features of the
present is the use in table and toilet
wares of metals other than the white.
Right royal has been the road of
burnished copper to favor. Its rich hue
strikes the eye strongly; its soft luster
strengthens the first pleasing impres
sion. In its splendid color there is a
depth and yet a delicacy that arrests
and holds the fancy.
Burnished copper with silver orna
ment appears in vases, desk and smok
Ing set, tankards and range, umbrella
handles and numberless small things,
but the new combination is handsomest
on the toilet table. Imagine a Watteau
plaque in gray silver enlivened and
warmed with a decorative frame of
shintag copper, the whole forming the
back of a hand mirror. Silver deposit
work in copper is most effective.
Slver gilt is also now much used and
is not at all confined to purely decora
tive objects, but enriches all sorts of
table silver frm . spoons to complete
tea sets.
The smalt and odd wares of the table
offer much novelty. Here for elegant
srvice are the ramequinsof decorated
French porcelain set into a pierced sil
ver trame, with the one long side han
dle eharaeteistic of the cruder proto
type, and there are silver entree dishes
with ears and a cover resting upon a
small plate.
Bouillon cups of decorated china In
silver frames with loving cup handles
term a cbarming array.
Peculiarly attractive are slender choc
olate cups of French porcelain deco
sated in pink and provided with frames
whose base of pierced silver Is a squat.
instead of the usual circle.
Quite a pleasing wrinkle for the bost
ess abreast of the times are the dainty
little Individual almond dishes that
form a set with the regulation almond
dish.
'he oyster cocktai glass has become
a thing ef importance in the past year.
One example of It in porcelain on a
silver standard takes the form of the
ordinary chapagne glas and indeed
might rve either purpose.
