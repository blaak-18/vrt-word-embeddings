L.ast Saturday, at 9:30 o'clock,
Mrs. Arthur Blroussard, nee Marie
Lolette Guidtry, - departed this life
at the age of 34 years and t month.
It is, indeed, sad to die so young,
when life is so full of hope, and to
make ier deatih all the more sorrowful
to her kin and fiiends, she was of
such a kii.d dis:po:,iti ,n, that her
presence was like the sunshine. To
the inconsolda'le husband, kin Ired
and nany frie :dl;, The Gazette ex
tends its most sincere sympathy.
A novel entertainment will be

of a court of justice. After the en
tertainment a ball will take place

cordial invitation is extended to the
people of the adjoining towns to at
tend.
Qtuite an interesting game of
base ball took last Sunday at the
grounds near town between a nine
of Ile Pilette andti the Black Dia
Imonds of Lafayette. They played
five innings and the visitors
were ahead at the end of their
fifth inning. Nothing daunted the
Lafayette boys, went to the
bat to win their half of the last in
ning, and by a fine spurt succeeded
in batting out three runs, and won
the game. Appended is the score
by innings:
Lafayette.....o o 2 o 3-5
Ile Plilette......2 o o 2 o-4
Mr. D. V. Gardebled, who has
been in the employ of Mr. Wm.
Clegg for the past nine years as
druggist and confidential clerk in
the. banking department of that
houte, having an opportunity to en
gage in business on his own account
at Bay St. Louis, has felt impelled
to accept it, and will leave for that
place on next Tuesday. Mr. Garde
bled is a young gentleman of strict
integrity and fine character. By
hi- urbane manners and pleasant
disposition, he has created a large
circle of warm friends, and is most
favorably known by the whole comr
munity, who regret his departure,
and The Gazette, in common with
them, wishes Mr. Gardebled a full
measure of success in his new field.
The Jennings Times is publishing
the interesting alddress of i-Ion.
Gustave A. Breaux, delivered dur
ing the fair held in that town re
cently. The article relates to "su
gar cane culture, and its adaptability
to Southwestern LouisiaJa." The
Times says that "the address was
highly practical and for that reason
we (The Times) wish to place it in
the hands of our readers, so that the
information and suggestions which
it contains may be appropriated to
the advantage oL our (its) farmers.
In additionr Mr. -Breaux has gener
ously arranged with the Times to
print xooo copies of the address in
pamphlet form at his expense for
free distribution among the far
mers of Southwest Louisiana. Mr.
Breaux is surely proving a genuine
interest in the progress of the far
ming industry of this region." '
Some interesting races took place
last Sunday on Cleophas Broussard's
race course near town, and brought
to town a great number of people
of the adjoining towns. The prin
cipal event was the race between
Maud S., belonging to Mr. Octave
Romero, of Iberia and Maud S.,
belonging to Mr. Adolphe Prejean,
of Carencro, the Iberia horse win
ning, the distance being 14 arces.
In the afternoon the same horses
ran io acres, resulting in t!e victory
of Mr. Prejean's mare. Owing to
the admission price being so cents
the attendance was not very large.
The admission price is usually 25
cents and a great many people re
fused to pay more. Mr. Broussard,
the proprietor of the- track, had
nothing to do with the admission fee
as he had rented the track to par
ties from Iberia.
