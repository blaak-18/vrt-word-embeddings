A Hot Bath.
A couple of gelitlemten, whom we
shall call John Smith and James I
Bro~un, were seated in the ante-room c
of a bath-house, awhiting their 'turns' a
for a bath. After they got tired of
twirling their thumibs, Sumth asked.:
Brown whether heo preferred a hot or' a
cold bath. Brown, who was remark- t
ably fond of running a rig on any one, r
said he was partial,to hot hbaths, and v
enjoyed them so .frequently that he i
didn't think there was <any other man t
in creation that could remain in water c
4t the temperature lie ordinarily used. a
Smith was one of those kind of men t
who never permit themselves to be a
outdone iii anything, and one word
led to another, until at length Smith c
proposed the following wager, to p
which Brown agreed at once:
Two baths, in rooms adjoining, e
were to be prepared. Cold water, to
the depth of six inches, to be let in. t
They were to enter at the same in- 1
stunt-the hot water tap then to be h
turned, and the one that first cried t
"enough !" was to pay for a supper a
and "tixins." Smith went honestly c
to work, entered the bath, and turned 1
on the hot water, taking special good N
care to draw up his legs as far as pos. %
sible. Brown turned the hot water s
tap, but instead of permitting the hot
water to remain in the bath, he let it
out by means ofa contrivance he man
aged to rig up. The tap was to lie
,'turned," but there wis nothing said t
about where the water should go. t
Brown said to hinmsell :
"If I don't boil that Smith, it will ,
not be my fault." 1
Presently Smith found the water
too hot for comfort, and said, How
is it with you. Brown I"
"Hot enough," was the reply. "I (
shall have to give up right off, if ,youn
don't," he continued, as lie lay cool
enough at the bottom of the bath. I
Smith was thinking about giving in i
beat, but Brown's words encouraged t
him to hold out a little longer.
"I'm perfectly cool yet," said Smith, I
as he writhed and twisted about, "and I
can stand out two minutes longer, so I
you'd better give up, Brown."
"The water is 'tarnal hot, you a
know ; but I shall hold out a few so- c
conds longer," said Brown.
Smith could not: With a half-sup
pressed cry of pain lie sprang from I
the hot water literally parboiled Has- I
tily drawing on some of his clothing, I
he entered Brown's room, and saw c
him lying very comfortably at the
bottom of the empty bath, smoking a
cigar. He found that he had been º
done brown as well as boiled, when
Brown insisted that his tap was turn- 1
ed fairly, but as not a word was said
about where the water should go, 1
lie preferred passing it through the I
plug hole. Smith promises to pay
for the supper as soon as he congeals
which will not be just yet.
THa MIssIssIPPI.--Mr. Brancroft re
marks in the tenth volume of his His
tory of the United States, just out :
The Mississippi river is the guar
dian and the pledge of the union of
the States of hMaerica. Had they
been confined to the eastern slope of
t"ire Alleghenies there would have
been no geographical unity between
them, and the thread of connection
between lands that merely fringed
the Atlantic must soon have been
Ssundered. The Father of Rivers
gathersa'hlis waters from all the clouds
that bretak betwveen the Allegheinies
aadt4hnfurtheriranges of the Rocky
Iopntaine. Theridges e f the eastern
ehanin blow their beads at ..th North
ihd at the South, so that long before
science became the companion of mnii
. nature herself pointed out to the bar
r bsrou.s races how short portages join
his tributary rivers to those of tits
-Atlantic coast. At the other side his
mightiest arm interlocks with the
arms of the Oregon and the Colorado,
and by the conformation of the earth
itself, marshals highways to the Paci
fic. From his remotest springs ie
Sreftees to suffer his waters to be di
vided; but as he bears them all to
the bosom of the ocean the myriads
of flags that wave above his head are
all the enligns of one great people.
Statesarger than kingdoms flourish
where he passes, andbeneath his steps
cities start into being iore marvelous
i their reality than fabled creations
of enchantment. His magnificent vat
ley, lying in the best part of the tem
perate zane, salubrious, wonderfully
fertile, is the chosen master ground
of the most vari6ns of human nculture
brought together by men salnmiondi
frenrll the civilizedt nations of the
eitb,.and joiued in the bonds of come
.mon citizenship by the strong, invis
. ible attracstin oe(republican fredoion.
Now thatnienbehM come tob be

which the republie has unassailably

Freedom of Speech.
Jas 11H. Cosgrove, the bold and fear
less Editor of the YIrldicator at Nat- St
etitoches, has been arrestedt upon t
some trntiped up hallrge and is now Ih
"in durance vile." This is an out- m
rage for which there is no parallel li
since the dcays when Seward used to pi
tinkle his little bell and order the :ur- o0
rest and coifinement of Editors and pi
whom he.pleased in the North. Some at
day a retributive Justice will over
ritle all the Constitutional tights se- p4
cure l to the citizens of what was once fit
a fre;, country. The bitter foe of i all t
tyrdf1ts is a free precs and it is the ci
one they most fear.
We are not informed as to the spe. ti
cific charge ;against our friend Cos- el
grove, but we endorse any and every- hi
thing he has ever said in the Vitdii- g:
cater, and if the officer who holds the
warrant for his arrest will have the ca
kindness to inform us what partieci- ca
lar articles in the lirdicator has fi;
brought Cosgrove under the bann of s&
the law, we will republish them upon
our own responsibility, aild lie may hi
conimc after us too. We want a free
press and if we are not to have it we
would like to know it right' now, so p1
we may understand just where we
stand. If there is a censor of the re
press in the person of every petty I'. st
8. Marshal whose venom s;eeks to shut to
off free and outspoken expression of d
opinion, we want [to know- it right hi
now. We are in the same boat as a'
the Vindicator, Mr. Marshal, anid if at
you are paddling that canoe, paddle
us along too. We dent like to be o0
loft behind.-Caucaiau. tt

A young lady in the East End of 5
Cincinnati who has just returned from k
completing her education in Boston, ,
wanted to kiss her old lover last III
night, and her mother objected. The Ili
daughter drew up her queenly form 1ia
to its full height, and exclaimed : it
"Mother, terrible, tragical and sub- n,
limely retributive will be the course A
pursued by me if you refuse to allow is
him to place his alabbster lips to
mine, and enrapture my immortal g
soul by imprinting angelic sensations p
of divine bliss upon the iudispensa- II
ble members of my human physiog
nomy, and then kindly allowing me q
to takesa withdrawal from his bene- a
ficent presence." The mother feebly p
admitted that her objections were t
overrauled.
.1
He went.out. between the acts, andti
returned vigorously chewing a clove. t
His wife asked him where lie had
been, and he said. "To see a friend."
She calmly replied that she thought t
his friend must be dead, as she could i
smell his bier.

Test 4f Affectlon. F
Mr. Archibald Stanhope -a groggy
sentimentalist, residing in Buckley In
street,. Philadelphia-conceived the bi
harrowing suspicion that his'wife was to
not as passionately fond of him as a st
lady of good taste should be and to Ct
put the matter to a fair trial, Ihe hit I)
on a little stratagem which he put in b:
practice the other day with the re- of
suits hereafter to be detailed. at
Hle took a suit of clothes and com- at
posed an eflligy of himself, by stuf
fing the garments with a quantity of of
straw, which had lately been dis- to
charged frmhi an old bed. H-laving
suspended this figure to a rafter in w
the garret by means of 'a piece of of
clothes-line, he ensconced himself be
hind a pile of runbbish iii the same b(
garret to watch the effect.
After a while his little daughter at
came up for a skipping-rope, and th
cailght a glimpse of the suspended an
figure. She tra down the stairs, dr
screaming : p
"Oh, mother, mother, daddy has
hung himself!" sp
"Now for it4" thought Archibald ; a
"we shall have a touching scene bh
presently." to
."Hung himself!" he heard Mrs. S.
repent, as she walked leisurely up- or
stairs; "he hasn't got spirit enough wi
for such a thing, or he wouid have he
done it long ago: Well, I believe lic ge
has done it, however," she continued, sil
as she came in view of Archibald's
straw representative. or
"Mloll," to the little girl, I think he in
ought to be cut down. You had bet-. n
ter go into the kitchen and get a knife,
umy dear but don't go down too fast, ti;
or yon might fall and hurt yourself. di
Stay, I forgot-there's no knife in the Ila
kitchen sharp enough. You can go fe
round to Mr. Homes, the shoemaker; bi
lies' only two squares off, and ask in
him to lend us his paring knife ; tell
him to whet it a little before oe sendk gi
it. And, Molly, while you are in the ti
neighborhood, you can call at your tI
Aunt Snkeyts and ask how the baby to
is. And, Molly, 3oucan stop at the ti
grocery shop as you come back and
get a pound of best moist sugar. ,
Poor Archy!" sighed Mrs. S., when at
her daughter had departed, "I hope t1
we'll get him. down before the vital cA
spark's extinct--for these buryings
are very troublesiome, and cost money.,
He wanted to put an end to himself,
too; and I think I ought to let him
have his own way for once in his life ;
le used to say that I was always a to
crossing him. I wish he hadn't spoiled tl
that new clothes-line-an old rope d
might have answered his purpose."
Here a voice, which sounded like y
that of the supposed suicide, broke a
in on Mrs. Stanhope's soliloquiy with, #j
"You confounded Jezebel, I'll be the '
death of you!"
Mrs.. S, thinking this mnut, of i
course, be a ghostly exclamation, at- cl
tered a wild scream, and attempted
to escape down the narrow staircase. t
Archibald, starting from his plaice of
concealment, gave chase. MIrs. S. a
stumbled midway on,,the flight of
stairs, and Mr. S. having jtst teached
her, and made a grit~p at li r dishev
elled hair as it streambd backward, d
I the amiable partners.were precipita- g
ted tothe bottom together.
Both were rather'badly bruised, Andu
I the cries of the lady raised the neigh- t
borhood. ;Archibald was arrested for
-making a disturbance, and practicing t
1 on tife tender sensibit4es of his wife.;
f He was bound over to keep the ~*ece I
Son a penalty of two hunodred and fitry
dollars, when he jocularly propose; ,

- but he found, to his sorrow, '~straw

ter, and sent out by the Massaachu
setts Society for the Prevention Ilif'

by several veterinary surgeons,',ngenfs
of railway and express companies,
and by Charles A. Currier, special
agent of the Society :
Potatoes or carrots may be given
ontce or twice a week to good advan
tage.
See that your horse is kept clean,
warm and comfortable, with plenty
of beddiug.
A piece of rock salt should always
be left in the manger.
See that his harness is kept soft
and clean,, particularly the inside of
the cllar, which ought always to be
smooth, as the perspiration, when
dry, causes irritation, .and is liable to
produce galls oh thle shoulder.
The collar sliould fit closely, withl
space enough at the bottom to admit
a man's hand. If too large it has the
bad effect of drawing the. shoulldcs
together.
On no consideration should a tars:
or any worik-horse be 'omnpelled to
wear a martingale, nH it draws til,
head down and prevents him fronm
getting into an easy and natural po
sition.
The check-rein may be used, but
only tight enough, to keep the head
in a natural position, and it should
never be wouu1d aound tihe lHaes.
See that the hatuesare buckled
tight enough at the top to .hring the
draf-iron near the center of the col
lar. If too loti it not only inter
feres with the action of the shouhlder,
but gives the collar is uleven'bear
ing.
Caution should be taken that the
girth is not buckled too tight, par
ticularly on strisii, teams, for when
the traces tsi' dtraightened it has the
tendency to: draw the, girth against
the belly and distress the horse.
See that the horse is kept well shod,
with ia good, stiff" shoe, always calkedt
at toe and heel on hind feet, as it is
there where all the propelling power
comnes from when heavily' loaded.
Keep the feet good and strong, b,
not allowing'them to be cut away too
ift~eh by the blackmith.
T!iebest ijndgmefit sholid be used
in loading, taking into consideration
the condition of.,the street and the
distance to be traveled. .
Never everload, .for by so doing
you only: distress, strain and discour
age your horsq and do him more in
jaury than yout cai posfibly gain by
carrying the extra loid. '
When your load is hard to pull,
, stbo often and' give your: horse a
chance to breathe...',
Remember the horse. is a very in
