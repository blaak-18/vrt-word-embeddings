A LAST RESORT.
BY ANTHONY HOPE.
"They're admirably suited to one an
othbr!" said 1.
"Oh, admirably!" said Cousin FLla
There was a pause; Flo frowned at
the fire, I drummed my fingers on the
table. I don't think that we either of
us looked very pleased. Yet it was a
most fortunate arrangement.
"The only thing that surprises me
about it," I observed, "is that Philippa
should have done it. I'm very glad, you
know, but I'm surprised!"
"l'm not surprised about her!" said
Flo.
I looked up, much annoyed.
"You might be above that!" said I
severely.
"I'm not blaming her, Dick. When
he likes, Capt. WVorslcy can be very-"
"Oh, I suppose he humbugged her.
about culture and all that. If I'd liked
to go on like that--"
'Well, Dick?"
"Oh, nothing. Don't worry a fel
low!"
"I'm sure that Capt. Worsley did
nothing that a gentleman wouldn't."
I was much annoyed at this remark
that I said to Flo:
"lie got over his disappointment
about you pretty soon, though!"
Flo laughed with extraordinary non
chalance as she answered:
"Philippa doesn't seem to have been
disappointed at all about you."
"'My dear Florence," said I, "I have
no desire to discuss Miss March with
you."
"Well, then, why did you begin
about Capt. Worsley?"
"Come, come, let's say no more about
thern. We're well quit of them. I
don't bear them malice, do you?"
"Not the least, Dick. In fact, I quite
understand what Philippa must have
felt about you. She likes serious peo
ple-people who have high aims, you
know. "
"I have very high aims," said I.
"Yes, but you don't hit," observed
Flo.
"At any rate," I cried, "I don't flirt
wholesale with anybody who--"
"What do you mean, Dick?"
At this point-and very fortunate
was the occurrence-Aunt Maud came
in. She has been married to the
colonel for three months, and is recov
ering her power of patronizing persons
who are engaged.
"I'm sorry to interrupt you. dears,"
said Aunt Maud, "but I've got a piece
of news. An engagement! Now guess
who it is!"
We neithedr of us spoke.
"Why, Philippa March and Capt.
Worsley! Aren't you surprised?"
"No," said Flo, viciously; "but Dick
"The precise opposite of that state
ment would convey the truth," said I,
stiffly.
Aunt Maid looked from Flo to me
and from me to Flo.
"Has anything gone wrong?" she
asked, anxiously. But as she obtained
no answer, she went on: "I've been to
see Philippa-and he was there. I
never saw a more radiant couple."
At this moment Aunt Maud certainly
saw a less radiant couple.
"Philippa took me aside," she pur
sued, "and told me that she had es
caped a great danger-"
Flo laughed-again most viciously.
"And was now happier than words.
Oh! and when Capt. WVorsley was put
ting me into the carriage, he said that
Philippa was absolutely the only girl
who had ever really touched his heart"
"Did he, though?" said I, with a
smile of triumphant malice.
"Though he didn't deny that he had
felt a passing fancy for one or two
others."
I slapped my thigh, with an appear
ance of great merriment. Flo had be
come quite red.
"So the air's full of engagements,"
beamed Aunt Miaud. "It's quite-"
"Stifling," said 1, thoughtlessly.
"My dear Dick, what a funky thing
to say! BIut Imust leave Flo to have
that out withyou. The colonel's wait
ing for me."
Aunt Maud withdrew. Then 1o,
with an air of dispassionate curiosity,
observed:
"I wonder if you think you've been
behaving like a gentleman!"
"My pOsition," said I, with elaborate
politeness, "is rather a difficultbne.
When the lady who has accepted my
hand not only displays obvious regret
at another man's engagement, but
further twits me-"
"With your obvious regret at another
girl's engagement. Yes?"
"I see no use in this Port of thing,"
said I, with dignity. Nothing else oc
curred to me to say at the moment.
"People always say that when they're
acored oU."
"' btse girl. who talk slapng."
;.71 . ". --:
"Nobody need stay to listen to it,"
said Flo, with a curtsey, and she turned
her back on met and looked out of the
window.
. I sat still for three minutes. Then I
stretched out my hand, took my hat,
and rose to my feet. I made some
little noise in moving-perhaps more
than I need. But Flo did not turn
round.
"Just fancy," said she, as though she
were enjoying a conversation with the
window-pane, "if this sort of thing
happened when we were married! And
unless you changed very much, it-"
-'If it were enough for me to
change-" 1 began, loftily.
"Now," interrupted Flo, still ad.
dressing herself to-the window-pane,
"it doesn't matter. We can just sepa
rate. But then we should have to go
on being together."
Something struck me in this last ob
servation. I laid down my hat.
"Gad, so we should!" said L "That
would be rather queer."
"We should have to stay in the same
house-even in the same room some
times!" And Flo's graceful back was
agitated with a shudder.
"We should," I assented. "I suppose
you wouldn't speak for the whole even
ing?"
" We should have to keep up appear
ances, and seem to be friendly when
the servants were there-and--oh, it
would be awfull"
1 put my hands in my pockets and
surveyed Flo.
"What should we ' have to do?" I
asked, with curiosity.
"Make a loathsome pretense of-of
still caring for one another, I suppose,"
said Flo, with a groan of prospective
horror.
"But what should we have to do?" I
persisted. I wanted details. "Should
we have to talk?"
"Yes," snapped Flo.
"Should I," I pursued, taking a
step towards Flo, "have to kiss you?"
"Oh, I suppose-I wonder why you
don't go!"
"And would you have to kiss rue?"
To this question I received no an
swer at all. But I was bound to ex
tract one; I could not leave the matter
unsettled. So I rang the bell.
"What are you ringing for?" raid Flo,
facing round suddenly.
"For the footman," said I, nodding
my head.
"I should have thought you could
find your way out," and she right
about-faced again.
Then William opened the door.
"Did you ring, sir?" he asked, ob
serving, I suppose, that Flo did not ap
pear to want anything.
"Yes, William, I rang. I want-"
"It's a mistake, William," came sud
denly from the window.
"No. it isn't," said I. "I must ask
William-"
"Nonsense, Dick! It's only Mr. Van
sittart's joke, William."
"Well, then," said I, "can we do it
without William? If so, he can go."
Titre was the slightest of pauses.
Then Flo said:
"Yes, you may go, William."
William, looking somewhat puzzled,
withdrew; and then Flo, much flushed,
turned round once for all.
"I can't think," said she, "how you
can be so foolish. I don't know what
you'd have done in another minute."
"I should," I answered, "have kept
up appearances."
Flo's lips twitched a little. I saw it
in a moment.
"It is perfectly useless for me," I ob
served, plaintively, "to try to escape
from you. Your resentment is not to
be relied upon for a quarter of an hour.
I am nearly heart-broken about Phil
ippa March."
"Well, I'm most sore about Chpt.
Worsley."
'-But," said 1, "I'm going to be a man.
I'm going to forget Philippa and keep
my word to you. Will you put the cap
tain out of your heart?"
"I'll try," said Causin Flo.
"Because you know if, after we are
married, you speak of him with re
gret-"
"Or if you seem to wia' Philippa
had -"
"All those terrible things will hap
pen."
"Yes, I know. Dick. Are we really
wise to-to risk it2"
I knitted my brows. It was really a
serious question. I studied Flo's
features.
"I'm puzz led," I answered. "'You're
very charming, Flo, but-"
"I don't trust you, Dick."
There was a long sad pause. -Flc
held out her hand with a resture of
farewelL I looked in her eyes. I took
the hand.
"It is really best," said Flc, gently.
"I suppose it is," said I, rather for
lornly, squeezing her hand.
"Marriage is such an irrevocable
step," Flo reminded me.
"Well, anyhow, it's very trouble
some to-"
"And if." interrupted Flo, "when i
was too late, when we aw-ke to the
fact-No! G-good-by. Dick:"
"Good-by, Flo," said I much moved.
Thus we parted. I took my hat, and.
without a backward glance, started
for the door.
At this moment, curiously enough,
the door opened. William came in.
-"Please, miss," said he, "tea's ready
in the drawing-roow."
"Thank you, William," said Flo, in a
very low voice.
William withdrew. I stood medita
tively in the middle of the room. Then
I put my hat down.
"Hang it," said I, resting my eyes on
Flo's face, "we shall always have the
servants!'"
"The servants?" murmured Flo, in
question.
"Why, yes," said I, and I began to
smile. "And, if the worst comes to the
worst, we must-" I paused and took
Flo's hand again.
"We must what, Dick?" she asked.
"WVe must," I answered, "rub along
on keeping up appearances."
We were disgracefully late for tea.

TREE ON A MAN.
The Sarvelotas Growth of a Wisp of Wil
low.
Jim Blanchard is a veteran prospec
tor, who tells some queer stbries of his
experience in the west, and when in a
talkative mood is always in demand.
WVhile sitting at the hotel the other
evening he was the center of an in
terested crowd. One of "the charac
teristics peculiar to travelers, in the
mountains especially, being unques
tioned veracity, no one would think'of
casting reflections upon the truthful
ness of Jim's statements.
He was telling of a trip from Deming,
N. M.., to Guimas, on the Gulf of Lower
California. He was accompanied by
James Hanigan, a Californian. Every
thing went well until they got about
two hundred and seventy-five miles
south of Deming. Here they halted at
a spring. Blanchard tethered the
horses, while Hanigan prepared the
meal. As they expected to make a dry
camp that n;ght, Hanigan suggested
that the water cask be refilled. To do
so, Blanchard thought the handiest
way would be to get the burro close to
the spring and fill the cask without re
moving it from the burro's back. The
burro demurred and threw Blanchard
into the stream. In falling he tore his
trousers from the hip to the knee.
Having neither needle nor thread, he
took the bark of a willow sprout and
sewed up the rent.
Now, the AMexican willow has a pe
culiar nature, and in the wet season a
young sprout has been known to de
velop into a good sized tree over night.
On awaking the next morning Blanch
ard found a willow tree growing from
his leg. The bark which he had
stripped from the sapling had taken
root and sprouted.
Tlhere was a stifled gasp heard
among the auditors which seemed to
disturb the speaker's serenity for a
moment. lie looked inquiringly for
the cause, but not a word was spoken
"It's a fact, gentlemen," he con
eluded, "that there tree got so blanked
cumbersome in two days that Hanigan
was obliged to chop it down to re
lieve me."-N. Y. Recorder.
WORKING THE BICYCLERS.
A 1u.ddy rnPsage Serves as a Trap to Catch
the Wheelmen.
"There's a justice of the peace in
a country town not far from here," said
a bicycler, to a reporter, "who has a
scheme that will make him a million
aire if he sticks to it for a year or
two.
"You see the town has an ordinance
forbidding bicycle riding on the side
walks. A good many wheelmen go
that way, so what does this justice do
but scoop out a hole and make a great
big mud puddle clear across the street
right in front of his office. Of course.
when the wheelman comes along,
rather than ride through the mud, he
turns upon the sidewalk. That's what
the justice is waiting for. He has a
constable on the watch, and the two
rush out and nab the cycler.
"I was caught in the snare last week.
Though I protested I only intended to
keep on the walk till I had passed the
mud, it was of no avail. I was fined
five dollars, and had to pay it. I got a
chance to look at the book when he
was recording my fine, and there was
record of some twenty wheelmen who
had been sarved the same way that
day, and it was still early in the after
noon.
"It made me mad, and I began abus
ing the old fellow for having such a
mud puddle in the street.
" 'Why don't you fill it up? I asked,
''if vou want wheelmen to keep in the
road?'
"lie grinned in a most exasperating
manner, and answered without so
much as a blush:
" 'Suppose we're going to destroy
such a source of revenue as that mud
puddle is? I guess not. John,' turn
ing to the constable, 'you better take
the hose and soften it up a little bit,
ready for the next sucker.' "-Buffalo
Express.
Lemous In Southern Italy.
The damp, soft air of Sorrento is per
fect for the cultivation of the orange,
but Mlassa-Lubrense, which is dry and
more sheltered, is given up to the pro
duct of lemons, which yield an enor
mous percentage to the fortunate pos
sessors of land that can be used for
that purpose. Orange trees are here
and .there mingled with the lemons.
just as lemon trees will be seen in the
midst of the orange-groves of Sorrento,
though in neither case they are the
chief produce of the place. Massa-Lu
brense is largely indebted for its salu
brious air to its lemon planta
tions. Three years must pass
befcre a newly-planted lemon
tree begins to bear fruit; and
in order to bring it to perfection, it
must be freely watered. A bollow is
dug around the base of the tree to re
ceive the water as in a basin, so that it
may slowly peuetrate to the roots.
Poles are planted at intervals in the
ground, somewhat higher than the
trees, and smaller poles or canes are
placed crossways above them, which
are covered with matting when the
winter approaches. It is not removed
till the spring is well advanced, for
lemon trees must be most carefully
sheltered from wind or frost. The
fruit is gathered chiefly during the
summer months, especially in May,
July and September, though there are
lemons on the trees all the year round.

SOILED LAMP SHADES.
Means of Cleaning the Filmy Drape of
Chiffon and Silk.
Compressed air is of great assistance
in cleaning lamp shades. Owing to the
delicacy of the fabrics a dry process
should be used, as silk, satin and lace
lose their luster when washed, and,
besides, the shade maker's touch is
more or less lost when the shades are
taken apart. Procure an infant's hair
brush, which is made of soft bristles
set in a bone back. The brush is small,
and for that reason and also because
of its softness, is best adapted
for cleaning silk and satin. Lamp
shades which have been used
in suburban houses and are mere
ly discolored with dust may be
satisfactorily renovated by a careful
and gentle scouring or scrubbing with
this little brush. To free lace-covered
shades from dust apply corn-meal for
light ones or Fuller's earth for dark,
and remove all loose powder by gentle
brushing and tapping, or by means of
compressed air if this is available. Fly
specks can generally be picked off with
the point of a knife.
Shades that are used -o the city soon
become noticeably soiled and black
ened, particularly about the collar, by
reason of the soot with which the air
is charged. The quickest way to clean
a shade that has been thus discolored
is to immerse as much of it as possible
in gasoline. which should be placed in
a clean dishpan, and move it briskly
about in the fluid.--Delineator.

WAYS OF DRUGGISTS.
Advice of One to His Assistant Regarding
Achlieving Success in tie Business.
"I noticed," said the druggist to his
assistant, "that a gentleman came in.
with a prescription, and that you took
it and gave him the stuff in about
three minutes. What do you mean by
that?"
"It was only a little carbolic acid
and water," replied the assistant. "I
simply had to pour a few drama of
acid into the bottle, and fill1 it up with
water."
"Never mind if you had only to do
that." the druggist declared. "Don't
you know that every prescription'
must take at least half an hour to fill,
or the customer will think he isn't
getting anything for his money?"
"When a prescription for salt and
water and peppermint and cough sirup
is handed to you, you must look at it
doubtfully, as if it were very hard to
make up. Then you must bring it to
ine. and we will both read it andshake
our heads. After'that you go back to
the client and ask him if he wants it
to-day. When he says he does you
answer that you'll make a special ef
fort.
"Now a patient appreciates a pre
scription like that that he's had so
much trouble over, and when he takes
it he derives some benefit from it. But
don't you do any more of that three
minute prescription business, my boy,
if you want to become a first-class
lruggist."-N. Y. World.

"Why is marble cake so called?"
"Marble cake is so -called because it
is marble cake-carved out of the solid
rock in Italy and imported here at
great expense."
"Wat's the idea of that?"
"Economy. It's cheaper in the long
run. You see a piece of genuine mar
ble cake will last a long time. Now,
here's a piece on this plate that has
been in the house ever since I came to
town-thirteen years ago this summer.
