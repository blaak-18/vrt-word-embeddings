It was generally expected that Mr.
Carss would again run on the Demo
cratic ticket this year, but his pres

NARCOTIC RING
LEADER TAKEN
GY FEDERAL MEN
Ben Oehler Arrested at St.
Cloud With $20,000
Worth of Drugs
HAS CRIMINAL RECORD
List of Customers in Three States
Is Basis far Official
Action
ST CLOUD, MINN., March 14.
Narcotics valued at $20,500 were seiz
ed and the alleged leader of “dope”
syndicate covering three states and
Canada, captured by Twin City fed
eral operatives last night.
The narcotic wholesaler gave his
name as Ben Oehler.
The seizure was made in St. Cloud
by narcotic wholesale agents operat
ing under the direction of J. B.
Greerson, chief of the northwest di
vision narcotic office. Agents from
St. Paul and Minneapolis made the
arrest.
Mr. Greeson declared this morning
the arrest of Oehler, well known in
the Twin City underworld, reveals
one of the most widespread drug
peddling schemes in the northwest.
Get List of Customers
Oehler, it is charged received nar
cotics from Canada and distributed
them throughout the small towns of
Minnesota, lowa, eastern South Dako
ta and western Wisconsin in a large
touring car, which was confiscated
last night.
When captured he had in his pos
session cocaine, heroin and morphine
worth more than $20,000, over $2,000
in supposedly received from
purchasers, and a list of customers
in three states.
Many of the customers will be in
vestigated on suspicion they are act
ing as retail agents.
Mr. Greeson secured a warrant
charging Oehler with violation of
the federal narcotic law today from
United States Attorney Lafayette M.
French. He is held in the St. Cloud
jail.
Federal agents charge that Oehler
also had connections with a ring
smuggling drugs from Europe and
Canada to Chicago, with St. Paul and
Minneapolis as subdistributing
points.
Caught in a Trap
Oehler, described as one of the
most elusive and expert narcotic
peddlers, was caught in a trap laid
by federal agents, who got in touch
with him through a tip that he was
on his way from Sioux City, la. They
arranged to meet him in St. Cloud
and when he drove in, they met him
as customers, paying SI,OOO marked
money. Agents seized him and found
narcotics, in glass vials in his car. A
companion, to whom he gave a lift
along the road, was arrested but lat
er released.
Mr. Greeson, in St. Paul for the
warrant, said the arrest is one of the
most important in many months as it
reveals the narcotic sales system ex
tending from Minnesota and lowa to
Canada and Atlantic coast ports.
The drugs found had foreign labels
indicating manufactured mostly in
Italy, France and Switzerland.
Narcotic agents said Oehler’s case
confirmed their belief that Twin
Cities raids had forced peddlers’ acti
vities out into the country districts,
where Twin City addicts now go for
their supplies.
Not In Doctor’s Ring
Narcotic agents recently investi
gated St. Cloud narcotic conditions,
but Mr. Greeson said Oehler’s arrest
had no connection with this. Four
physicians were said to be involved
in the earlier investigations but no
arrests have been made as a result.
Agents after the earlier St. Cloud
narcotic investigation declared viola
tions there had been so flagrant that
a score of youths of school age were
threatened with life long addiction.
THIRD PARTY MAY
MEET IN ST. PAUL
(Continued from page 1)
secretary of the Nebraska Farmer-
Labor party, said Omaha was in the
race. Later, the mayor of Omaha of
fered to see to it that his city not
only would furnish the halls, but also
money for expenses, according to Mr.
Mahoney.
St. Paul Favored
“I don’t think Omaha will get any
where with its offer,” Mr. Mahoney
said today, “though they are certain
ly coming to the front. St. Paul has
offered convention accommodations,
but said nothing about expenses, and
we are now waiting to hear from
Minneapolis. The Twin Cities are lo
cated exactly right for the conven
tion and we want it either in Minne
apolis or St. Paul, if possible.
Asked about statements that La-
Follette merely will come before the
national convention for indorsement,
Mr. Mahoney said that was all up to
the senator, and that “we will do
whatever he wants us to do,” He
added that the convention certainly
would take advantage of the oppor
tunity to form working organizations
in states so far neglected.
Committees to Meet
The state central committee, nam
ed following the information of the
Farmer-Lalior federation designed to
do the organization work of the
Farmer-Labor party, will meet in

DEMAGOGUES HOLD
SWAY, SAYS ATWOOD
(Continued from page 1)
American congress from Philadelphia
to New Jersey.
“Even George Washington wrote at
that time that he could see nothing
ahead but the dark future of anarchy.
Then 56 men met in Philadelphia and
brought order out of chaos. They
were statesmen. They had such men
in America in those days. These men
met and wrote the constitution of
the United States.
“Their work is the only document
in the history of the world that in
stantly brought order and govern
ment of a situation bordering on an
archy and confusion. Based on the
tenets of that great document na
tional credit became an actuality
and America was recognized among
the nations of the world.
“And yet today the average chief
justice of a state supreme court does
not know what is in the constitu
tion. The average college president,
I venture to say, couldn't pass an ex
amination with a mark of 25 per cent
on ten questions based on the United
States constitution. Men nowadays
are popular and are chosen to office
not as they know but as they assault
the constitution.
('hose Golden Mean
“In that constitution our forbears
established a representative govern
ment. They carefully avoided the
principles of an autocracy with its
authority in the hands of hereditary
princes, but just as carefully avoided
the principles of democracy with its
follies of direct action and referen
dum. 1 venture to say that if the
constitution had been submitted to a
direct vote of the people it would
have lost by a vote of four to one or
ten to one.
“To the men who wrote the consti
tution, democracy meant about the
same as Bolshevism does to us today.
You will recall when first the Russian
socialits overthrew the government
of the czars how sentimental writ
ers blazone the fact to the world
that there was the dawn of a truly
democratic government. Well, they
were right. It was a democratic gov
ernment, but when it failed, these
same writers were quick to recant,
and to explain to their readers, ‘Oh.
we were mistaken. That was not
democracy but bolshevism.’ Thus a
new word was coined.
Our forefathers were strict believ
ers in a representative form of gov
ernment. Of course they assumed
that we. their children, to whom the
wonderful heritage of such a govern
ment was given, would be careful in
choosing our representatives to carry
on that government.
Thought Well of Posterity
“They assumed that the people of
such a commonwealth as Minnesota
would appreciate that heritage. They
could not have imagined that a man
would be sent to the United States
senate from such a commonwealth on
his boast that he had never read our
history. , , ...
“If Garfield, the canal boy. driving
his mules, with a smile on his face
at the thought that he was really in
the land of opportunity, that if he
did one job well he would get a bet
ter, striving evenings to improve his
mind that he might be worthy some
day of bigger things, lived today
some agitator would approach him
with the argument. ‘You have a hell
of a job. This is a hell of a country.
Get the mule drivers organized.
Form a bloc, like the agricultural
bloc where every member is a bone
head and some day the mule drivers
may send you to the legislature.
That is what the present general ton
is substituting for the ideals left
them in our constitution.
“We are failing, in this present
day, to keep the sacred contract with
the unborn as the great dead kept it
with us."
The mind gains earnestness
and strength by definite action.

NATION MUST HAVE
RIGHT EDUCATION
Carnegie Foundation for Ad
vancement of Teaching
Issues Report
(Scottish Rite News Bureau)
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 20.
Education is usually held by educa
tes as a panacea for all world ills.
Tnat education which does not edu
cate is as bad as no opportunity and
that there is a tendency which
should be corrected in curricula ol
modern high schools to “spread edu
cation too thin” is the warning con
veyed in a just published report of
the Carnegie foundation for the ad
vancement of teaching. In this, Dr.
Henry S. Pritchett says that too
many high schools teach music, art,
drawing, household and industrial
arts, dancing, typewriting, journal
ism and advertising, which, while all
excellent in themselves, sometimes
crowd out more essential educational
subjects.
The results, so Ltr. Pritchett finds,
is a “softness” in high school meth
ods which is bad for educational pro
gress. He says in part:
“The high school should no longer
be the refuge for mediocrity that we
have made it. Teachers are coerced
by parents, by school directors, by all
the influences that can be brought to
bear, to keep in their classes num
bers of students whose happiness and
usefulness are to be found elsewhere.
The high school cannot turn itself
into a vocational school without los
ing in large measure the place that
it ought to occupy in the general
cultural education of the people.”

Somehow tno»e opposed to the Ku

Wing learned of the rapid growth of
the Protestant organization and came
to the conclusion that the field man
was, in some measure, responsible for
the increasing strength of the Klux
ers. The present organizer has been
absent from Red Wing for some time
and, on his return, went to work on
such an effective basis that the ac
tivities of the Goodhue county organ
ization were brought in an indirect
way to the attention of the people.
“Antis” Make Attack
The “antis” evidently proceeded to
connect the recent increases in Klan
membership with the field man and
so thought, as near as we can learn,
that the first attack on the Klan
should be made immediately and the
preliminary onslaught centered upon
the Ku Klux Klan organizer. One day
the field man, as usual, went to get
his mail and. among divers letters.

Congressman Granted
Leave to Stand Trial
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 20.
Rep. Harold Knutson, St, Cloud, has
requested the house to give him an
indefinite leave of absence, pending
his trial on charges of a statutory
offense.
The Minnesota congressman’s case
will go before a grand jury at Ar
lington court house, Virginia, April
14.
there was one containing a strip of
blue paper on whch was typewritten
the followng threat:
“YOU WILL GET OUT OF RED
WING AND STAY OUT OR PAY
THE PENALTY. The Ku Klux
Klan has been dead and buried
for a year and that is the way it
stays with YOU gone so YOU
GO.”
There was no signature of any kind
attached to this friendly message, but
through a check-up on typewriters
owned by certain individuals in Red
Wing, it will not be impossible to
learn the identity of the sender.
Eagle Answers Question
Somebody asked a question of The
Red Wing Eagle pertaining to the
Ku Klux Klan of Goodhue county
and received an answer that the Klan
of Red Wing is decreasing in mem
bership rapidly.
If the editor of this daily, with all
his boasted wisdom, only knew about
the enthusiasm existing in the or
ganization, and was aware of the rap
id growth of the Klan in his town, he
most likely would renew the part
anti-Klan attacks, by breaking into
print against the Invisible Empire
through editorial outbursts and con
cocted stories intended to leave er
roneous impressions. It would ap
pease the nervousness of a certain
element in Red Wing to which The
Eagle editor seems to cater. How
ever, “Where ignoimcce is bliss, ’tis
folly to be wise.”
