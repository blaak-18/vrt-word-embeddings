as the sense of the meeting, which

adopted with unanimity :
Whereas, The redemption of Louis
iana from the corrupt usurpation
which oppresses the Stae, can
only be effected by the united action
of all our people who oppose the su
premacy of the ignorant and vicious,
and desire the restoration of our State
government to the control and man
agement of the virtuous and intelli
gent of the community;
And whereas, We believe that this
can only be effected by the white peo
pie of the State earnestly uniting and
pledging their efforts towards the
election of competent white men, of
iroper intellectual qualiscations and
undoubted integrity, to otflees execa
tive, legislative, judicial aid paro
chial; -
And whereas, We reognmzo and
shall faithfully uphold all the consti
tutional and le. rights to whbich the
colored eitiseans ofthis Stats are en
titled, yet we are tirmly coovinced of
their inqaacty to perforon the du
ties ofo rl ead stand to f l'the im
portant ofees, eaeutive and minis
terial, whlich are necessary in the en
foreemnt ot laws and management
of pulineo ais; and iwe believe that
the prOe1ty' ad'ibiptovemedt of
the colored people thmselves, will be
promoted by -time rsorio:of the
government and of these offices to
tleir more intelligent, experileud
and competent whmte fellii*-itlseua .
Therefore, beit resolved, hat, in
the opinion of this Convention, re
presenting the people of the Parth
ofNatchtoce, oppset to radiae

Obituary.
DIED at his residence, in this pa lish, on
the 30th ult., TRECIxI DIA)L'UCHES, in
the 56th year of his age.
In the death of Mr. Deslouches, the
neighborhood has lost the kindest neigh.
I)or, the most steadfast of friends and the
most benevolent of men. He was, as far
as he was known, regarded as one of the
most charilable and hospitable men of
the Parish. Urbane and retiring in his
mamlerN, and although horn of one of
the old and highly respected Creole fam
ilies of Natchitoches, he was but little
acquainted, save with the ancient popu
lation of ante hellum days. A striking
peculiarity of this truly benevolent man's
character, was his entire unsellishness
and his acute sensitiveness regarding his
conduct towards other men, believing in,
and carrying out that great moral doc
trine, "do unto others as you would they
should do unto on." . Mr. Deslonche
was twice marrid, first with the daughter
of Terence Chaler, Esq., by whom he had
two children, both livinlg; his second
wife being the daughter of the late Pierre
Michel (Zoriche) by whom he had one
child. lie leaves a distressed widow and
three children to mourn a loss, that they
but too deeply feel, together with all who
had the pleasure of thiS acquaintance of
this upright and just man. Above his
new made grave mort than one, who has
been the recipient of his bounty, will
moisten with grateful tears the red earth
thl:t covers his loved remains, and kneel
ing at his last resting place, will send an
orison to the most High for the eternal
rest of him. who, whilst in this epid and
selfish world, renmembered the poor and
distressed, and relieved them with a gen
erous, charitable and bountiful hand.
A FRJ1ND.
The Address of the Committee
of Seventy.
Upon the white men of the State
alone devolves the salvation of the
State. And the white men of the
State have the power, if they will but
use it. If not, why talk longer of the
superiority of race, of the moral pow
er of intelligence and education, of
the triumph of mind over matter I
But to exercise this power so as to
secure its triumph, demands the ut
most harmony and the most cordial
union, not a unio4 of discordant ele
ments, pressed together by the pre
sence and shadow of a vast danger,
but a union of hearts and sympathies,
cemented by feelings of trust in each
others courage and patriotism.
How to attain this harmony then
is the next question. Indeed it is the
great absorbing question. In con
sidering it the committee was aware
that two conventions had been called,
one by the State Central Committee
of the Democratic party, for the 24th
of August in New Orleans; and the
other by the Shreveport Times news
paper, echoed by several country
journals, and seconded by some able
and patriotic gentlemen from the
country, at Alexandria, for the 1st of
September.
The call of the Democratic Con
vention was first uttered, and its ad
dress to the pedple of the State se~im
ed to open the door for a perfect union
of all conservative men of the entire
State. It appealed to "all conserva
tive voter, without reference to past
political affiliation, to unite in the
election of dele tes to the Conven
tion." And if all conservative voters
unite in the selection of its delegates,
surely that Convention will fully re
present their views and wishes. Here,
then, we tfind a Convention called by
certainly the most powerful, ancient
and best disciplined party in 'the
State, where doors are so widely
thrown open that opponents of Rad
icalism in Louisiana may enter and
express their will.
But the address further says:
"Recent dissensions among our
people, and a deep. and. a.biding de
sire to unite all the elements opposed
to Radicalism, admonish us not to
risk everything upon our own isolated
and unaided,, efforts; although, in
this energency, duty prompts us to
exert outnlyes as if we were depend
ent apln our sole resources."
And again : "Therefore, forgetful
of past differences, and casting from
our breasts all heart-burnings, let
them be a cordial anion of all the con
servativdk f folodiiana :
"The Democratic party has no en
mikies to gratify, and holds out the
band of fellowship to all those who
are disposed to aid us in this crisis.
National politics are subordinate in
this canvass. The vital issue is re
demption from a corrupt State Gov
ernment and local misrule."
Can any Conservative within the
State refise to meet and confer with
men breathing a spirit like this ! The
Committee of Seventy indorsed that
address. It saw in it an opportunity
-the st, perhaps, that could be af
forded-for union and harmony.
It thought from the call itself that
the proposed Convention was to be
a convention of all the conservative
people of Louisiana, in which all op
ponents of Radicalism, of negro sa
premacy and of the Kellogg nusurpa
tion could ~ivefull and free expres.
sion to their views. This committee,
entertaining this view, could see no
use in.holding two conventions. It
therefore indorned thqo Demlberatic
call. It afterwards reqaested the
Democratle Central Committee to
change the place for holding the Con
vention to Bton Rouge, which was
promptly and patriotiEally done. This
was asked solely for the sake of har
mony-as a mere matter of oonces.
sion to the wishes of some of our
breth~ati the. ountt.. .,'
And now to that Convention we in.
vite and urge you to come. What
rmatter under whose auspic it is
called True that there is objection
on the partof some ofthe Democrat.
Io name. Let suoh rmnem~er that
the ocrcrt isa grand na
of T.e national Republicn pt
that it has been righting oar tte
when we have been powseres ad
voieless, andt thato-dyin its grand
ousagn~ht ~the wavering 'lines of
aleulmi. In all the State:of the
VUaoe, its iereest bhart cry As .;"R
member outraged anadwronged Louis
iana."
But remember, you who awislh, in this
campaign, to discard all party names,
that all the voters of the State who are
opposed to the existing uaurpation, are
invited, without reference to part'ra.i
liations, to send delegates to thl Con
vention. Upon your oaw free choice
alone will depend its character and com
plerion.
The majorit!y in that Convention-
tyour chosen representatires-will give
shape to and consolidate the opposition
to IRadicalism, and, as your represen
tatives* will determine in all of its de
tails. the conduct of the campaign.
Citizens of Louisiana, brethren,
you who are opposed to the existing
usurpation, you who desire to see
Louisiana take her place, the. peer of
her sister States in the Federal Union,
in the full enjoyment of the inestima
ble right of lcal self-government,
you who desire to see her redeemed
from the hands of the corrupt, the
ignorant and the venal who have so
long controlled her destinies, ani
have involved State and people in
common bankruptcy, and in social,
moral and political degradation.
Whether you call yourselves Demo
crats, White Leaguers, Independents,
Reformers, or Liberals, have you not
the manhood, have you not th morald
courage, have you not the patriotism
and the practical good sense in view
of the tremendous issue involved to
lay aside your personal, local and
partisan preferences and prejudices,
and unite as one man in this mighty
conflict, in which your interest and
purposes are identical ?
Then, in the name of home, of coun
try, of the very integrity of your race,
of all that men hold sacred and dear
we beseech you to unite, to banish all
hatreds, to still every discordant
thought and word.
Devided, you fall an easy prey to
tbhe attack of disciplined ignorance
and venal greed, and this beloved
State, with all of its great destinies,
is lost to us forever.
*United, you must conquer, and
b*athe the magic touch of intelligent
and honest government; peace and
prosperity will smile through all of
your borders, and Louisiana redeem
ect, willte a noble heritage for you
and your ehildren forever. U •
Weigh well theissue, and so deter
mine and so act that you way jot sub
ject yourselves hereafter to the just
reproach of having committed politi
cal suicide.

"Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever borne a I
widespread and unblemished reputation
for the unsurpseed purity, retiuement
and excellence of the Serials, Sketches
and Miscellaneous reading matter.
It is pre-eminently
The Best Family Paper
that is published in this country, from its
never containing anything that would
offend the feelings of any one, either in
a religious or political sense, or that
could not be read at any fireside without
objection from the most fastidious.
The eirculation of the Saturday Even
ing Post, through not quite so large
perhaps, as its younger contemporaries,
is not, like that of some of them, fiuetu
ating, sad too often short-lived, but
SURE, SOLID AND SUBSTANTIAL,
based upon thelutrinaie merit of the ina
per itself and not dependent on any ex
tranenus influences, such as the populari
ty of individaAl writers, &c.
Good, however as the Saturday Even

intention to make it still better in the
future, and with this object in view we
will effect a marked improvemen. in pve
ry department of the paper, and will
call to our assistance writers of admitted
ability and known reputation. "
By iiereasing its former, attractions,
and adding many judicious and pleas
in novelties, by studying how to please
and cultivate the popular taste, by in
1ereasin industry and enterprise, and by
