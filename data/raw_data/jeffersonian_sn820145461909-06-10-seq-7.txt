FINE WORK BY ELEVEN-YEAR
OLD BOY.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir:—l have been using what
spare time that I have had out from
the farm soliciting subscribers for
the Jeffersonian. I have but little
time to stick down my plow and
leave a mule, but since I wrote you
last I have got up for the Jefferson
ian five new subscribers. Enclosed
you will find P. O. order for $5.
Please forward papers and knives to
the names listed on separate sheet.
I am going to keep at work for sub
scribers. The work is very satisfy
ing to me, because I, an 11-year-old
boy, am helping out the cause of re
form. I have been reading after you
ever since I could read and compre
hend, and it has been a big schooling
to me.
Hoping you success, and with best
wishes, I am,
THOS. WATSON SMITH.
Swainsboro, Ga., R. F. D. No. 5.
RECALLING OMAHA PLATFORM
DAYS.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir:—l enclose $2 for renew
al of my subscription to the Monthly
and Weekly Jeffersonians. I need a
new knife.
I do not know when my subscrip
tion expires, but please advance the
date, as I regard these as the most
valuable of the papers I keep on
hand for the entertainment of the
public while waiting for trains.
They are read by many and with
approval in almost every instance.
I have always earnestly hoped for
a union of the forces with the Social
ist element, and it appears that the
differences between their platforms
are not so great that they should pre
vent this. I was always very much
attached to the name of “The Peo
ple’s Party,” but I would just as
soon vote for Mr. Watson under the
name Socialist as any other, feeling,
if I do so, that I would be casting my
vote for better government. I can
remember when the Republicans
were called “Black Republicans,” a
term intended to be as offensive as
the word “nigger.” I, with the oth
er Poplists, was compelled to submit
to the violent storm of abuse that
was heaped on us upon the adoption
of the Omaha Platform, and we
should not assist in adding to the
stigma that is cast on the Socialists,
whose only “crime” is that, from
their point of view, they are advo
cating what they believe to be a bet
ter method of the administration of
public affairs. Let us get together.
The mutterings of discontent are
both loud and deep, and if the re
form forces can only be united vic
tory will be ours in 1912.
Wishing you every possible per
sonal happiness as well as success in
public, I remain,
Sincerely yours,
J. H. CALDERHEAD.
Buford, N. D.
WILL NEVER BE WITHOUT THE
JEFFERSONIANS.
Dear Sir: —I send herewith 50
cents to go on my Magazine subscrip
tion. This will make my subscrip
tion to both the Jeffersonians run to
gether, so I will know to always re
new for both at once. I don’t expect
to ever be without them as long as
they stand for the principles they
have so far advocated, and I feel very
sure they will continue on that line
as long as you are at the helm.
Though I know we will not live to
see these principles prevail, that
should not deter us from doing all
we can for their success it is our duty
to do, and, if need be, to suffer for
the right, let visible results be what
they may.
Ever your true friend,
N. J. BELTON.
Simsboro, La., May 17, 1909.
SHOWING NEED FOR HOME
MISSIONS.
Dear Sir:—Enclosed find money
order for renewal of subscription for
the Jeffersonian. Would like to take
the Magazine, too, but am not able
at present, though hope to be before
the year ends. lam not a Populist,
but like you and your writings. I
have the same views you have about
Foreign Missions. I think we ought
to help the poor at home. I know
several families near me that are too
poor to send their children to school,
and they have from ten to thirteen
from one year up to twenty-two, and
not more than one can write his
name. If you ever run for President
again, I expect to vote for you if I
am alive, but by health is not the
best in the world and I am now 66
years old and not able to do much
work. But I get a pension, and that
helps me to live.
Respectfully your friend,
GEO. N. FOOTMAN.

UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED WE
FALL.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Sir and Bro.: —Your edi
torials and writings are certainly
splendid.
I wish, however, to say to the pub
lic, and especially to all members of
the reform factions, that as a mem
ber of organized labor for forty
years, or more, that organized labor,
generally, adheres to the initiative,
referendum and recall as a funda
mental principle, and all so-called re
form factions do champion this same
principle; yet they all take great
pride, it seems, in dividing their
forces on election day, and thereby
they all assist the so-called Demo
cratic-Republican machines to hold
up the people. It is either done
from a lack of intelligence, or many
of these so-called reform leaders are
the paid tools of this so-called
Democratic-Republican machine who
are the agents of the trusts and com
binations of capital. There is no
middle grounds; any man, or set of
men, who claim to adhere to the
principles of the initiative, referen
dum and recall should be willing to
join his fellow-man in a united re
form political party, taking as its
fundamental principle the initiative,
referendum and recall. Such a union
of reform forces would draw to it
many thousands of men from the so
called Democratic-Republican parties
and insure success for this united po
litical party in 1912. The name of
this united party should be, “Union,”
then no one could have cause for ob
jecting. Remember, my brothers, a
political party must first get into
power, into office, before they can
make laws, legislate for the people.
Our platforms are not laws, and we
must get together on what we do
'Hkffersoniait
agree upon to win a victory, and then
we can legislate instead of resolve
and resolve. “United we stand, di
vided we fall.”
Very respectfully and fraternally,
J. R. NORMAN,
Populist State Chairman of lowa.
Albia, lowa, May 24, 1909.
LEADERS OF REFORM PARTIES
SHOULD MEET AND AGREE
ON A PLATFORM.
Dear Sir: —I notice that several
persons are giving you their views
and preferences as to the anticipated
council, the change of name, etc.,
and if you will allow me some space
in your valuable paper, I would like
to give your many readers my ideas
on the subject.
I would like to see Messrs. Wat
son, Debs, Mitchell, Gompers, Hearst,
Barker and LaFollette meet in pri
vate council and discuss the matter
until they are satisfied that they can
give the reform voters a platform
that the people can endorse, and
then draft the platform, and each
member of this council shall pledge
himself to abide by the same. Then
this council should set a time and
place for a national conference. Any
man of common judgment knows
that with all reformers voting 'for
five or six different candidates we
will never down the trusts and com
bines. So I say, if we can’t get all
we want and. what we believe to be
right, let us take a half loaf.
I name these men because they are
all leading men and all of them have
a good many followers.
As to the name of the party: The
present name suits me best, but I am
not wedded to any name. I want a
government of the people, and for
the people.
With best wishes to you and the
grand principles that you are con
tending for. Respectfully,
A. PAGE.

ABOUT “A PLEA FOR TOBACCO
GROWERS.”
Hon. A. Owsley Stanley,
Washington, D. C.
Dear Sir: —In Watson’s Jefferson
ian of May 13, which I take, I read
your speech of April 5 in Congress,
“A Plea for Tobacco Growers.” Just
think, it seems there is nothing
whatever grown or made, but there
is an outrageous trust burden, tax or
tariff put on it.
But have you thought of the tax
(tariff) interest put on money by
Congress, -the one thing every hu
man being must have and use, or de
prived of it starve and die?
This robbery has been going on
for forty-five years, and do you know
that next session the banks are go
ing to raid Congress to destroy the
last of the people’s good free money,
the silver dollar and the greenback?
Where will you stand? All right for
the people, we hope. But do read
enclosures, and please write and tell
us whether you will arouse Kentucky
to resist this far greater affliction.
Tell the people, too, ofc the Aldrich-
Vreeland-Teller bill of the last Con
gress, a gift of $500,000,000 to the
Wall Street banks to further rob the
people by promoting stock jobbing
schemes. Yours truly,
JOS. N. STEPHENS,
Sec’y U. S. Monetary League.
