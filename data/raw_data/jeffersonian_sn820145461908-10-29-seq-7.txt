Crane sent to the Quitman Adver
tiser for publication a letter, just
after you spoke here in Quitman,
written in language so extremely
severe that the paper refused to
publish it, and returned it to the
writer without comment. This letter
of Mr. Crane’s, as we understand it,
changed and put in milder form, by
being published in the Weekly Jef
fersonian, has been thus dignified
into notice, which otherwise was
ignored.
To show that injustice is done to
the Quitman Advertiser and its
editor, and that Mr. Crane is mis
taken and has misconstrued both the
editor and the paper, a statement of
the facts is given below:
The paper is open alike to Popu
lists and Democrats.
While the editor of the Quitman
Advertiser is ji Democrat, the files
of the paper show,'that during the
brief time that Dr. Gaulden has been
editor, he has not written one word
of abuse of you or of the Populists,
but on the contrary that, while dif
fering courteously from you and the
People’s party’ he has, editorially,
paid you the highest tribute in his
power, and has spoken of the Popu
lists in the kindest and most con
siderate terms.
Enclosed find several clippings from
the Quitman Advertiser. The first
is an editorial written by Dr. Gaulden
on the day you spoke here.
The next is an editorial written by
him, showing his kind feeling and
high appreciation of the Populists.
The above facts show conclusively
our position that Mr. Crane is mis
taken and that the publication of his
letter addressed to the Quitman
Advertiser), in the Weekly Jef
fersonian, is calculated to do Dr.
Gaulden great injustice among your
friends and readers of the paper, who
may think tha L your paper endorses
the incorrect view taken by Mr.
Crane and approves the severe criti
cisms made by him.

Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Sir and Comrade: Your
weekly Jeffersonian of October 15 is
at hand, and I wish you to use the
enclosed $1 to help you out in your
gallant, but up-hill, fight in behalf of
the common people.
And now, my dear Mr. Watson, let
me give you a few words of advice.
After the election you are going to
call a conference of the Populists to
lay plans for a continued fight for
our principles for the next four years.
That is the proper thing to do. But
do not make it sectional, for the
reason that at least nine-tenths of the
reforms for which we have contend
ed for 10, these many years, are need
ed here in the East and North as well
as in the South and West —although
I am aware that you will get the
quickest returns from those sections
(as I lived in Kansas from 1869 to
1881, and am an old Greenbecker
from away back). Still, I hope, Mr.
Watson, to both see you and hear
you speak in the near future here in
New England, perhaps here in Dan
ielson. We need shaking up here
very badly.
1 am nearly sixty-two, and my
health is poor, but as one of the Old
Guard, I will never surrender.
Truly your friend,
THEO. F. BAILEY.
Bowersville, Ga., Oct. 20, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My dear Mr. Watson: It is amaz
ing to think of how you have been
giving your time, your money and
your life for a people who are so un
grateful that they stand idle and see
you struggling in this great battle for
their freedom, and never raise their
voices or lift a helping hand —and
they are the farming and laboring
people.
Brothers, let us send in our mite,
as the widow did, and help pay the*
expenses of our own cause. It is a
heavy burden on our brave and noble
leader to pay for the tickets that
ought and must go to every district
in the State. Let’s all help him.
Don’t say it is too late, for it is not,
even though it does not reach him
until after the election. We justly
owe it.
Mr. Watson is making the greatest
fight of his life, and all for the great
common people, the people who feed
and clothe all other classes of the
world. Comrades of the 60’s, and
the old true guards of the 90’s, let’s
help him on to victory, and the honor
3effersontan
will be ours and the blessing 'will be
for all. I enclose one dollar
Very truly yours,
W. J. GLOVER.
A NEW JEFFERSONIAN PAPER.
Mr. W. B. O’Neal began the publi
cation of the People’s Advocate at
D’Lo, Miss., a few weeks ago, but his
press was unable to meet the de
mands upon it, and he suspended un
til October 17, when the second num
ber appeared. It is a bright little
paper, and will undoubtedly find a
great many readers. Mr. O’Neal lives
in a country where Jeffersonian doc
trines are fast coming to be “under
standed nf thn people,” and the edi
torials in the Advocate show that the
paper starts out along the right lines
to deserve and command success.
Editor Jeffersonian:
Some few days since there came to
my address a copy of The Radical, a
paper published in Atlanta, so I sup
posed, and advocating the election of
Yancey Carter to the governorship of
Georgia and, I suppose, the election
of W. R. Hearst to the presidency of
the United States, as well, though it
has very little to say about him,
either for or against him. In fact,
one would be led to believe, after
reading’ Mr. Carter’s announcement,
that he rather advocated the elec
tion of Bryan than that of Hearst.
At any rate, he seems to have no
word of condemnation for him.
Strange, is it not? But stranger still,
is the fact that he has turned his
battery of invectives on Mr. Watson,
because of his persistent lambasting
of Bryan, when, in fact, he should be
commending him for it. Bryan needs
to be lambasted and Tom Watson*
can do it more effectually than any
man I know of. But to Mr. Carter
again. It is hard to understand his
position toward Mr. Watson, for we
all know that at one time he was
battling along with Mr. Watson for
the triumph of the principles for
which he has fought so long and so
courageously and for which he is still
fighting.
I have no unkind word for Mr.
Carter personally, but politically I
am far removed from him in senti
ment, and in addressing a copy of
their paper to me it is very evident
that their firing has gone wide of the
mark, for T am one of the Old Guard
and have been on the firing line for
fifteen years, and at this writing my
physical anatomy is thoroughly per
meated with the principles of Wat
sonian Democracy.
JNO. B. GIBSON.
The state election will have come
and gone before this reaches you, per
haps, and if there is nothing to it,
assign it to -the junk pile, the fate
which befell the one before.

My Honored Friend: I see in The
Atlanta Constitution where an inter
view occurred with Governor Smith
and the Chairman of the State Ex
ecutive Committee, whereupon Hoke
Smith gave it as his opinion that all
who voted in the state primary were
in honor bound to support Bryan’s
electors, another thrust at Mr. Wat-
son. Well, I, for one, shall not swal
low any such medicine, for I heartily
concur with what you said in this
matter in your great Royston speech.
No, Governor Smith, I shall, if liv
ing, go to the national election and
then and there vote for Thos. E. Wat
son, and by so doing have a con
science void of offense toward God
or man, and I hope that no one who
intends to vote for Mr. Watson will
be gulled by your spiteful dust-
Mr. Watson, a line from you on this
point may prevent some of your sup
porters from being misled, who are
halting between two opinions.
Yours trulv,
VOTER.

Dear Sir: I notice in the weekly
Jeffersonian of the 17th instant, Mr.
Farris in replying to Alfred Henry
Lewis says that Bryan voted for an
Ex-Confederate soldier to the Post
master —Mr. J. D. Calhoun. So he
did. iSo did Senator Allen and the
Republican Senator who, I think, was
Thurston, and all the Representatives,
both Populist and Republican, from
Nebraska. But Mr. Farris did not
tell that J. D. Calhoun supported
Bryan in both his races for Congress,
which he did, and if I am not mis
taken, brother’s paper was the first
to advocate Bryan’s nomination for
Congress.
Yours truly,
FRANK CALHOUN.

JEFFERSONIAN PREMIUMS.
Owing to the crowded condition
of our columns during the last two
weeks of the campaign we have been
compelled to leave out the notices
of our premium offers. Our issue of
November sth, will contain another
list of premiums, with instructions
as to getting up clubs. We trust
that all our friends will continue to
work for the premiums that have
already been announced. We will
acknowledge receipt of all such sub

number of receipts are turned in to
us, we will send the premium called
for. THE JEFFERSONIANS,
