A Few Truths for the Return
ing Board.
The right to choose our rulers by
the ballot is inherent and cannot be
legally divested. It is one of those
privileges of an American citizens
that will never be relinquished and
will be jealously guarded against
any invasion or infringement. In
the exercise of that right we find-
1. The deposit of the ballot in the
hox or receptacle provided to receive
it, is 'the election." The voter hav
ing deposited his ballot, has declir
ed his choice in the manner pointed
out by law.
2; The counting of the ballots is not
the election ; it is the means by which
the election is tobe ascertained; and
this duty is performed by the agents
appointed by the law, and all the
voter can do is to stand by and see
the votes properly counted.
lie has no control over the officers
-nor is he to lose an iota of his rights
by reason of any omission, neglect,
fault or fraud of any comnmissioner or
other officers, over whose acts he has
no supervision or control.
3. The great object of election laws
regulating the registry, the voting
and the returns thereof is to protect
and guard the right of the voter
against fraud or violence; but these
safe-guards are not to be used to
defeat that right by the omissions, ne
glect or frauds of the officers to whom
these trusts are confided.
4. When the voting has been fair
and no charge made and established
of fraud or unfhirness, then no return
of the votes should be thrown out by
reason of any omission of form "by
commissioners, supervisors or deputy
supervisors or any of the crowd of
officials whom the present laws ap
point.
Finally, the Returning Board must
keep prominently in view, as their
polar star of action, that the laws are
made to secure the right of the citi
zen not to take it away, and that he
is not to lose his right by any act
over which he can have no control. If
any other construction were permit
ted then the managers of election,
and not the electors, could and would
control the elections by controlling
the returns.
The people, then, will hold the Re
turning Board to a strict accounta
bility, and will not submit to any
decision whereby their' votes are to
be thrown out. They have been long
patient under oppression, and have
tolerated fraud and corruption, and
quietly submitted to wrongs that no
other peoplecould have borne. They
have resolved to yield no more, and
they will repeat history by rising
against their oppressors and making
them feel the power of an outraged
people, if any attempt be made by
the Returning Board to repeat the
frauds of 1872.-N. O. Balletia.
Speech of Senator Thurman,
OF OHIO.
IN WASHINGTON ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT
Washinuton, Nov. 4.-The Demo

G. Thurman, of Ohio, to-night at his

'Ia Usarp maltra century seat.s a
honest Democrat in her guber'nato
rial chair I And, in this connection,
was it not right, gentlemen, that I
should refer to B. F. Butler, who, in
accepting his last nomination, gave
as his chief'reaAon for wishing to re
main in Congress the i destre to use
his will and ability to still further
bind and repress the Southern peo
ple t But the time has passed when
his persecutionary cry found a ready
response in the hearts of his consti
tuents. The time has passed when
violations of the Constitution, con
tempt for justice, disregard of sound
policy, neglect of the interests of the
people could all be overlooked, un
der the influence of passion and pre
judice ; and hence the result you see.
He raised the black flag of persecu
tion, and under that hateful banner
sought to maintain his place in Con
gress. The people rained the white
flag; not of defeat, but of peace, and
said to the would-be persecutor "Stay
thou at home." If you ask nmefellow
citizens, what are the causes of our
victories, I answer, discontent with
Radical rule; if you ask me fur the
reasons of this discontent, I answer
that our Radical rulers have in the
last nine years persistently set at
naught every instinct, feeling, habit
and teaching of the American people.
Americans are Constitution-loving
people, but no regard has been paid
to the Constitution by our rulers.
Americans are a liberty loving peo
ple, but liberty has been remnorsely
trampled under foot. Americans are
a home rule loving people, but home
rule has been treated with scorn and
contempt, and Congress assumes and
exercises the powers of an omnipo
tent parliament. Amex icans are an
honesty loving people, Credit Mobi
liers, Shanborn contracts, Custom
house frauds, anid Washington rings
have made corruption almost ait sy
nonym for government. The finan
cial embarrassments now upon the
country could not be attributed to
the Democratic party, as that party
had no power in this land for the past
twelve years. The Republican party
had a triumphant majority in both
Houses of Congress and absolute
control of the finances of the country.
In reply to cry of "How about the
Independent press" M~r. Thurman
said the press accomplished work du
ring the past year which would re
dound to its honor as long as the
press last. In reply to the question
"IIow about Third Term " Mr. Thur
man said: My friend in the White
House has not given that idea up yet.
lie is trying to fight it out on that
line if it takes a year and a half. If
the President.don't want a third term,
why in Heavens name don't he say
so I He (Thurman) saw in the news
papers a few day ago that Gen. Grant
did not consider it consistant with
his dignity to make any denial of be
ing a candidate for a third term. That
was a very poor apology. The Re
publican State convention of South
Carolina had solemnnlyinominated him
for a tbird term ; did not that author
ize him to speak on the subject I or i
did he consider that the Radical par- 4
ty in South Carolina was so uteriy f
contemptible he could not answer f I

AIT DEPAIRTMI IlNT, 1874.
'The illh'tratious ort the AulaunEs have
won a world-wide reptttation, and in the
art centres of Europe it is au admitted fact
that its wood cuts are examples of the
highest perfaetion ever attained. The
E, comen prgjndice in f:ivor of'steel plates'
is rapidly yielding to a more educated and
eiscriminating taste which recoguizes the
al advantages and superior artistic qulllty
he with grelater tefacility of pruduction. Th'e
wood-Ciut of the AI.DIxI: possess all the
,. delicacy and elaboratae finish of the most
t. costly steel Ilate, while they affordi a bet
ter rendering of the artist's original.
To fully realize the wonderful work
which t.he Aldine is hloin- for the cause of
a. art culture in America. it is only neces-'
sary to consider the cost to the people of
Pany otfher decent rel)resentations of the
i'prduetions of great painters.
1: adhlitionl to designs by the members
of the National Academy and other noted
American artists, the Aldtine will leprio
dlUce examples of the best foreign masters,
selected with a view to the highest artis
tic success and greatest gelnelral interest.
Thins the subscriber to the Alline will, at
a trilling cost, enjoy in his own home the
pleasiaures and refining influences of true
,t, art."
The quarterly tinted plates for 1874 will
be by Thos. Moran and .1 D. Wosiward.
The Christnas issue for 1874 will con
taitn special designs appropriate to the
season, by our best artists, and will sur
pa-s in attractions any of its predecessors
Prermiums for 1874.
Every subscriber to the Aldine for 1874
o will receive a pair of chromlos. The orig
inal lictureas were painted in oil for the
publisheirs of the Aldine, by Thomas Mo
ailran, whose grrat Colorado picture was
p)nurhaseda by Congress for ten thousand
s- dollars. The subjects were chosen to rep
te resent '" The East" and " The West." One
is a view of the White Mountains, New
e- Hampshire; the other gives the cliffs of
of Green River, Wyoming Territory. The
i diiterence in the nature of the scenes t
a. themselves is a pleasing contrast, and af
Sfords ti good display of the artist's scope a
,f and coloring. The chromoes are each work
ed from thirty distinct plates, and are in
it size (12 by 16) and appearance exact fac
simniles of the originals. The presentation
of a worthy exatupleof America's greatest
i landscape painter tothe subscribers of the
Aldiue was a bold but peculiarly happy
idea, and its successful realization is at

The Oldest and Be:t Story Paper Pub
lished.
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Post has been tlti
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Counntry, and has ever borne a
widespread and nblenmished repntation r
tor the. unsurpassed purity, refineumeit
and excellence of the Serials, fketehes
and Miscellaneous reading matter.
It is pre-eminently
The Best Family Paper
that is publishedl in this country, fromi its
never containing anything that would
offend the feoditigs of any one, either in
a religious or political sense, or that
could not be read at ny tireside without
obijection fronm the most fontidious.
The circulation of the Saturday Even
ing Post, through not quite so large
perhaps, as its younger contemporaries,
is not, like that of some of them, fluctu
ating, aind too often short-lived, but
SURE, SOLID A1IND SUBSTAXTIAL,
Iased upon the intrinsic merit of the pa
per itself atid not dependent on any ex
traneous inflluences, such as the populri
ty of individual writers, &e. e
Good, however, as the Saturday Even
ing Post has been in the past, it is our
intention to make it still better in the
fulture, and with this object in view we.
will efect a marked improvement in eve
ry departnent of the Ilpaper, and will
call to ouFassistance writers of admitted
ability and known repitation.
By increasing its former attractions,
and addiug many judicious and pleab
ing novelties; by studyinug how to lilease
and cultivate the popular tastk, by in- g
creasing industry and enterprise, and by
enlarged facilitiesn we hope to make new
friends with each and every issie, afid
