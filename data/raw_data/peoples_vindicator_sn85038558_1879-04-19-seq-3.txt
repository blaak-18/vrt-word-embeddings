The Weather,
This week has been a favorable one to
onr farmers, especially to those who had I
.Ibeen unable to break their land on ac- n
count of dry we:ther, and hardness of
the surface. Sunllday we hal a slight a
shower, Monday brought us a good heavy a
rain. making farmers feel jubilant, and I
gaele' truck pot. on a new dress. Tues- t
dlay we had the heaviest rain of the sea- c
son,, ac conmpnied with a severe hailf
storm doing much damage to fences anld
trees. t
Sweet to the Ear.
There are some who are not forgetful
of those sweet. enchanting strains, which
floating upon the midnight air, awake
fair sleepers from most pleasant dreams.
This reporter aecidlently dropped in on
"Tauzin's String Band" last Saturday
night, and found the members gathered
about a table whereon was a waiter coy
ered with a white napkin, bearing upon
its survey surface, two beautiful frosted
cakes, surrounded with artistically ar
ranged white and red roses. Expres
sions of admiration were numerous, and
when those cakes were cut, the "boys'"
eyes fairly danced with pleasure, while
their palates were being tickled with the
delicious sweetness of this elegant token
of remembrance and encouragement.
The Band feels grateful to know that
at least one young lady encourages their
efforts. The fair donor was Miss H. Geor
gia Barlow, and the Band passed suit
able resolutions of thanks for this truly
elegant gift The incident, being a rare
one, is worthy of mention by this local
reporter.
Shot by a Wild Hog.
A farmer in Ward 8 whose name we
fail to learn met with a severe accident
this week, while bunting hogs. His dog
klyed a wild boar within the roots of a
fallen tree, the aforesaid farmer got on
the tree to punch the hog with the butt
end of his ritle to make it get out, and
while so doing the hog snatched the gun,
causing it to tire, and empty its load into
the fIarmer's stile Our informant says
that the wound is not serious, but thinks
this is the only case on record where a
hog is known to hava shot a man. We
think so, too.
Easter Sports.
Easter sports are not so popular now
as they were when we were a boy, we
remember when it was impossible for
anc one to pass clown St. Denis or Second
on account of the large crowds that con
gregated on those streets testing the
strength of colored eggs, pitching quoits,
wrestling. etc. Last Sunday, we do not
think that there conld have been over
fifty persons Who indulged in breaking
eggs, and as for the other sports they are
lost.
There is a settlement in this parish,
about eighteen miles from the city,
known as "Spanish Town," whose set
tiers in the old days were Spaniards and
Mexicans, they kept up the Easter sports
until the war. They had a society who
styled themselves as the "Wolf Repell
ers." The members all wore masks, and
dressed in gandy coetumes. Any mem
ber of the ehurch who failed to attend
mass regularly was booked by the secre
tary of this society and on Easter San
day they would administer to that estray
memlswr of the flock a sounnd threshing.
Spaniards d Mexicans were known to
travel a bondred miles to attend, the
festivities of Easter at this place. The
men formed a procession and paraded
around the ebhureh, in the meantime the
women would hurdle together, knowing
that the men would break ranks and
attack them for a kiss, whlich they
claimed the right to, and in ease of re
fusalthelady had to pay a ne. Ugly
maids and widows stood a poor show for
a kiss, and Ina eoosequenes of wbhich a big
"row" would take- place between the
feminine sex, cresting lots of mer
rimeat for the visiting sports.
Tents were anumerous around the
chureh, eating shope, dance houses, and
gambling carried on to a lgreat etent.
Mnss. Fred Hubley and Sam Paine,
who are yet living sad resideats of thbi
eity, deali, for a number of yearn, at
this place, the Mexican's favorite game
known asm"Monte." It is a well known
fact that the Mexican get so infatuated
while betting at this game that be will
stake everythinu he has on it. All
of these Easter sports also have lest their
popularity out in that settlement.

Base BalL
Last Sunday was the day appointed
for ball tossing between the "Allwriglits" I
and "'Acmes"; and in a business point of
view of course the sporting fraternity
were anxious to see a good clealr
and bright dlay, but their hopes were,
blasted; as the men were making
their w:ay to the grounds large black
clouds could be seen gathering with 1
signs of a heavy shower, but as the boys i,
were intent on deciding the first game of E
the series for the championship, they r
cared naught for the elouds.
At 3:30 o'elock game was called with r
"Acmes" to the bat and the "Allwrights" A
to gambol on the green. I
"Acmes."-Leconote who i well known t
for his avoirdupois weight gathered the
stick anal belted the leather making first t
base, followed by Janin, Raggio and Ore- 1
neax. Schuman went out on a "ly'"
caught by C. Ware. Sera was allowed c
also to take a rest. Lattier sent a
grounler into short stop and made his I
first by a scratch. Kiln drops one inside I
of the diamond ring and made first
Tucker picked up the bat and went out i
on a foul and the "Aemes" retired with I
five runs.
"Allwrights."-Tausin grasped the wil. .
low and sent a hot scraper into third I
hbae, making his first. Noonan walked
up with a smile and went out on a foul a
Sprowl aent a daisy cutter into the field, I
giving him two bases, and Tanuin was
heard to say, as be placed his mod per
ambulator on the home plate, "tally, one,
Mr. Scorer." Briggs gathered the wil.
low and put a dropper between the home
plate and pitcher, which gave him two
bases. C. Ware made Int. Kile took
second on call balls. H. Ware picked up
the bat and "resolved to die" or bring
the boys in, he sent a fly into left-field,
which was gracefully handled by Kile
making a double play. Greneaux step
ped in and stepped out quickly on a
foul. Scores-3.
"Acmes."-Lecomte snatched the bat
to belt the ball but was allowed by the
catcher to take a seat on the grass, that ibe
might take a dose of anti-fat. Janin sra
ia sky-swallow into 2d which was maffed
by Brigg . Raggio and Greneaux made
1st and 2d. Schuman handled the wil
low with such force that he brought them
all in. Sers picked up the bat but was
told by the umpire to take a rest on the
gra3a. Lattier sent a fly into field and
made his Ist. Kilo went out on a ground
er. Scores -5.
"Allwrights"-Gabin made Ist. Tauzin
sent a fly into third which was muffad by
Schuman. Noonan sent a By into left

which Raggio was unable to stop. C.

postponed. The following is the score

Ever since we can remember, it hain
been the custom in this place foir the
Ilutchers to have a parade on Satur
day, before Easter Sunday, with fife
and drum, and a fatted beef. A large
beef is selected for the occasion, sta
bled and fed on corn for four or five
weeks prior to Easter Sunday. Mr.
KaIhn, lnr l.popular butcher, and his
tlinmllers, tllrned out last Saturday
morning with life and drum, and a
mounted herder leading a fine large
black beet, handsomely rigged tup
with evergreens and boqluets. The
beef looked as gentle as a lamb. The
procession marched daown Second
street from the slaughter- house,
thelmce up Front to tihe slaughter.
house, there to be killed and dressed
for thb ,pubice. We got a hump of
that beef for our Easter dinner, and
