People's Party Platform.
1. We demand a inational cur
rency, safe, sound and fltexible, is
sued by the general government
only, a full legal tender for all debt
public and private, and that with.
out the use of banking corpora
tions; ajust, equi able and efficient
means of distribu ion, direct to the
people, at a tax not exceeding 2 per
cent, be provided, as set forth in
the sub- reasury plan of the Farm
ers' Alliance, or some better system 4
also by payments in discharge of
its obligations for public improve- 1
ments.
a. We demand free and unlimit
ed coinage of silver and gold at the I
present legal ratio of 1g to 1.
b. We demand that the amount 1
of circulating medium he speedily 4
increased to not less than $S40 per It
capita.
c. We demand a graduated in-I
come tax.
d. We believe that the money
of the country should be kept as
much as possible in the hands ot I
the people, and hence we demand
that all State and national revenue t
shall be limited to the necessary ,
expenses of the government, eco- i
nomically and honestly administer
ed.
e. We demand that postal say
ings banks be established by the
government for the safe deposit of
the earnings of the people and to
facilitate exchange.
2. Transportation being a means
of exchange and public necessity,
the government should own and
operate the railroads in the inter
eat of the people.
a. The telegraph andl telephore,
like the poet office system, being a
necessity for the transportation oft
news, should be owned and opera
ted by the government in the in- t
terest of the people. C
3. The land, including all the 8
national resources of wealth, is the I
heritage of all the people, and B
sboeld not be monopolized for spec- t
ulative purposes, and alien owner- .
ship of land should be prohibited.
All land now betd by railroads and I
other corpotations in exeess of p
their actua mneeds, and all lands t
now owned byt'liens, should be re- <
eed by the government and
Sfor actal settlers only.

AMONG THE RECORDS.
HOW THEY VOTED ON THE
EXTENSION OF NATION
AL BANK CHAR
TER.
The Porwer or the Banks Over
the Currency and Over
the Busines of the
Coulitry.
No Ique(tion before the Anieri
can lP"'ple is equal in ilnixrtance
to the Imoney question, and no
phase 04 the money Iquest ion is of
equal importance to that relating
to the power to issue it. The con
stitution of the United States gives
congress the power to "coin money
and regulate the value thereof."
To coin means to create, and the
Supreme court of the United
States has said that congress has
the lower to issue or create paper
money, and to make it a legal ten
der in the payment of debts. In
1 s4u the democratic party declared
that "'conitress had no right to
charter a United States bank."
They further declared that "such
an institution was dangerous to the 1
liberties of the people and ctalcula
ted to place the Iusiness of the
country within the control of a
concentrated money power and
above the laws and the will of the 1
people." That plank was reattirm- 1
ed in every platform up to IcSt'.
Since that time both parties have
espoused the. cause of the
b:tnks of issue. Jeffers'n said
that "lbanks were more dangerous
than standing armies." At anoth
er time, in a letter to Mr. Eppes,
he said, "hank paper must be sup
pressed and the circulating medium
restored to the people to whom it
belongs." John C. Calhoun said.
"The bank is a union of the gov
ernment and the money power-a
union far more dangerous than
church and state." Henry Clay
said, "I conceive the establishment
of a national hank dangerous to
the safety and welfare of this re- 1
public."
Thos. H. Benton said: "Gov
ernments ought not to delegate this
power (issuing money) if it could.
It is too great a power to be trusted
to any banking company whatever,
or to any authority but the highest
anti most responsible government."
In two of Andrew Jackson's mes
sages he opposed it with all the in
tensity of his nature. In his fare
well address he said:
"The result of the ill-advised
legislation, which established this
great monopoly, was to concentrate
the whole moneyed power of the
country, and its numerous de
pendents, under the direction and
command of one acknowledged
head; then organizing this particu
lar interest as one body, and se
curing to ii unity and concert of
action, throughout the United
States, and enabling it to bring
forward, upon any occasion, its
entire and undivided strength to 1
support or defeat any measure of
the government. In the hands of
this formidable power, thus per-t
fectly organized, was also placedt
unlimited dominion over the I
amount of the circulating medium,
giving it the power to regulate the
value of property and the fruits of I
labor, in every quarter of the Un- t
ion and to bestow prosperity or I
bring ruin upon any city or section t
of the country, as might best com-l
port with its own interest or poli- a
cy."
N'o principle in political economy i
is bettter eutsblisaed than that the
voume t money regulates .its 1
value - compared with ,commodi
ties. In other words the volume
of money in circulattion fixes(
priace. Then the power that con
trols the volume of money also j
controls prices of commodities. i
W ebster. "('tmire-" was _ v cen
control oi'tlr the tIrrenIIcV." lThe
estal li-hmcnt of the National
bank was a nrrender of that pow
er. The Iankers have used it to
their own atlvantage and against
the pleople. The system of nation
al banks, in a nutshell is. the peo
ple collectivcel as a governlient
loaning mloney to the bankers at I
ia .r cent and Iborrowing_ it back at
10 and 12 per cent. The banker
gets interest on what he owes and
the people pay interest on what is
coming to them. No one doubts
the stability of the bank notes, be
cause they are hackedt up by the
government-the people. They
are lased upon the wealth and
credit of the nation. But why the
people should loan them to the
banker at 1 per cent and borrow
them back at 1I andI 12 per cent.
is something that nobtoly but the
banker can explain, and he says
"it is business, you know." Many
Sdcenlocratic speaker has pledgedl
the iparty to repeal this system, but
we find when they have the chance
they walk in the footsteps of the
rephullicnlns a'nd are really in favor
of granting the banks still further
privileges--Mr. Voorhees introduc
ing a mneasure to that effect. Wheri
the bill came up to extend the char
ter for twenty years longer, July
12, 18t+2. the vote was as follows:
In the Senate.
FOR EXTENDING THIE CHARTERS.
Repubiican . ..........................
Democrat. ............. ...... ...... 6

Democrats .......................... 22
Total........................ 125
AGAINSt EXTENSION.
Republicans ....................... 3
Ikemocratsq....................... 56
Greeubaekers........................ 8
Total ...................... 67
This was a very light vote.
Seventy-eight democrats dodged
the vote. Had they come up and
voted as they had talked and pro
mised the bill would have been de
featsd. The democrats have made
no effort in the present congress to
secure the abolition of these banks
or of the system. Their promises
have all follen to the ground.

"The editor of a weekly journal
lately lost two of his subscribers
for accidentally departing from the
beaten track in his answer to cor
re~gndent.
Two of his subscribers wrote to
inquire for their respective trou
bles. No. 1, a hlappy father of
twins, wrote to inquire the best
way to get them fairly over their
teething, and No. 2 wanted to
know how to protect his orchard
from the myriads of grasshoppers.
The editor framed his answers on
the orthodox lines, but transposed
the names, with the result that No.
1, who was blessed with the twins
read in reply to his query, ":cover

fire to them, and the little pests af

grasshoppers, was told to :'Give

\s I see your paper is dlisposedl
to Ibe, fair and unprejudliced. I
wouldl like to make a few state
ments in rearud to the unfairness
and almost insolence with whii'h
I was treated at the state conven
tion in D)allas.
I was a delegate to the conven
tion and expectedl to see ai digni
ti.xl, cahn, deliberative body, alive
to the importance of the work they
had to do.
Thcy were alive-I admit that.
but I would hardly call their pro
ceedings dignitied. I had four
ribs of my umbrella and one of
imy own broken on the first ballot.
I got up in nmy chair to nominate
the old civil war horse, John II.
Rea'rap. when a national hank pre
side-nt struck lme on the head with
a large two-thirds rule and I came
near falling into the Third party
plattform. I never saw such dis
graceful scenes.
I was ,nce in Tannuanv hall
when they wer:, trying to nominate
a scalpers' ticket for congress. but
that meeting was no more like the
l).llas convention than a game of
chess is like one of Wagner's sym
phonies in Asia Minor.
If the Cullkrson man who was
seen to take a portion of my left
ear and my left pantaloon leg, will
return them, no questions will ihe
answered.
I am not going to any more con
ventions except by proxy, and not
then unless he is my dead Ily enemy.
The nearest I got to being heard
was when I climbed a post and re
marked: "Fellow citizens: I am
here to nominate that glorious old
war-horse of Democracy, that gal
lant relic of southern chivalry,
who in common with every man in
Texas pants for .--"
Just here a Lanham man raised
up and got the other leg of my
pants and was reaching iup for a
porous phlater on my back, when
I was compelled to cut my spleech
short and go into close caucus
while I sent for sorme clothes.
When nominations were made
for judges, there were about seven
teen Mississippi boat whistles turn
ed loose at once. Ballots were
taken by watching the roof flap up
and down as they were cailed out.
The most flaps got the nomina
tion.
The umpire was about to call the
game on account of hoarseness,
when a stranger rose up andt said
he had kept the score, and stated
who was nominated.
Rather than have any words
with a man who had a real fine
baratone voice and was quite sober
the judges were declared nomina
ted, but recommended to the mercy
of the convention.

as you like, but I am done with
