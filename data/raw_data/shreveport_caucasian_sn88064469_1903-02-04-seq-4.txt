DOLL
(Special Correspondence.)
Boston, Jan. 26.-There is in this city
today a rag doll the like of which is
not to be found anywhere else on the
face of the earth. It is not in appear
ance that this doll is remarkable, but it
is owing to the fact that it has just
completed a world girdling trip. With
out a chaperon this venturesome doll
has traveled from Boston to Boston by
a route that included many of the lar
gest cities of the world.
The doll is owned by Mrs. E. R. Hor
ton of 482 Massachusetts avenue and
is part of the famous international doll
collection .that has been exhibited dur

lug the past five years for charitable
purposes, the money thus garnered be
lag especially devoted to children's
charities.
The doll is named Columbia. She
started from Boston in April, 1900, her
traveling carriage being a handsome
telescope trunk, which the various ex
press companies had agreed to trans
port free of charge. From Boston she
went first to Philadelphia and then to
Pittsburg. From Pittsburg she jour
nyet to Cincinnati, then to Chicago,
St. Louis, Kansas City and Denver,
stopsing at many large cities between
Denver and the Pacific slope, and from
Alaska to Mexico. She journeyed on a
united States transport to the Philip
plie Islands, thence on another trans
port to China, Spain, Africa and finally
New York by tray of the Mediterra
asan, arriving in Boston in excellent
0easition.
It goes without saying that Columbia
has had aome ovel experiences. These
Jbra been receded in a journal which
plac gaed in the trunk as well as a
esgeas)ek for newspaper clippings.
When she left Boston, the weather was
aesl, and she was comfortably dressed

earse she encountered all sorts of
weather snd temperatures during her

CAUSES OF INDIGESTION.
3ow certain Ils Which Affect the
Stomach Become Chronic.
The causes of chronic indigestion are
manifold, but usually and almost al
ways in the beginning, even when the
stomach finally becomes actually dis
eased, the condition is due to improper
eating. It may not be that the sufferer
eats too much, although very many
people who are not gluttons do that,
but he eats improperly. One who suf
fers from dyspepsia or who wishes to
avoid such suffering should remember
that the stomach cannot do all the work
of digestion. Before it enters the stom
ach the food must be finely divided
and mixed with the saliva, which is as
certainly a digestive fluid as is the gas
tric juice. Gladstone, it is said, used
to chew every mouthful of food thirty
two times, one for each tooth, before
he swallowed it.
Long mastication of the food is use
ful in mafiy ways. In the first place,
it should appeal to all who delight in
the pleasures of the table, for if the
food is savory it is tasted longer and
better when well chewed. Again, long
mastication mixes the food well with
the saliva and begins its digestion, and
this sweetens the starchy food and im
proves its taste. Finally, if one eats
slowly, he will have less time to eat
much, and hunger is appeased and a
feeling of satiety is attained before the
stomach can become overloaded.
While one is chewing, the food should
be moved from side to side of the
mouth that the admixture with the sa
liva may be more thorough.
Too much fluid should not be taken
with the meal, but it is not a wise plan
to take none, as is sometimes recom
mended. The gastric juice should not
be too much diluted, but if the food is
well moistened the juice acts better
and more rapidly. One glass of water
with a meal is about the right amount
Cool- water, moreover, in moderate
quantity stimulates the secretion of
gastric juice, and a wineglassful of ice
water taken before the meal gives a
fillip to the appetite without any of the
drawbacks of liquor.
If in spite of all precautions chronic
indigestion persists, one should try the
experiment of eating only one kind of
food at a meal-meat, fish or eggs,
without bread and potatoes, or bread
and butter without animal food. The
stomach which rebels at a mixed meal
will often do its work satisfactorily if
offered only one article of food at a
time.-Youth's Companion.
The Amteeret of All the Russias.
No one can grasp the fundamental
state of things in Russia without realis
ing that there the will of the czar is as
the will of God. His land and his sub
jects are his, to dispose of as he may.
In a Russian battle not so long ago the
artillery. imperatively needed in front,
was stopped by a deep ditch. The sol
diers . flung themselves in until the
ditch was full, and the artillery gal
lope( over their bodies.
In the world of business it is quite
the same. A Russian administrator
was discussing with Sir Henry Norman
the military capabilities of the Trans.
siberian railway, and Norman Said:
"There wouldn't be rolling stock
enough to convey masses of troops in
a short time."
"Every engine and carriage in Russia
would be put there if necessary," was
the answer.
"But that would disorganize the whole
commerce of the country and bring
tens of thousands to ruin."
"Yoe don't understand," said the offi
cial. "It the czar gave the word to
take every railway carriage in Russia
and run It across the Siberian railway
and throw it into the China sea at the
SPA who should prevent him?"
A Cent a Year Salary.

Beceatly he closed a contract with

A HORRIBLE FATE.
A WIIOLE FAMILY DROWNED IN
THE MISSISSIPPI.
An Immigrant Car Plunged Into the
River at the Vicksburg Incline.
A Very Sad Story.
At an early hour Monday it was
known to many in Shreveport that an
immigrant car had plunged into thi
Mississippi river at Vicksburg and that
a family of six had been drowned in
sight of a number of people who could
give no assistance. The Picayune's spe
cial correspondent at Vicksburg giv< s
the details as follows:
Vicj:sburg, Miss., Feb. i.-. H. tan,
of Newton, Miss., and all of his family
of six, floated about, dead inclosed in a
box car. which had broke loose from t'e
switch engine on the Vicksburg, Shrev.
port and Pacific incline tonight shot tiy
after 6 o'clock, and ran down the ii
cline. over the transfer boat Delta and
into the Mississippi river,
The accident is without a parall4 in
this section, and brave hearted railroad
men are now standing almost transfixed
with consternation at the very awful
ness of the situation. The last heard of
Land was his shrieks for assistance,
which twenty men, standing helplessly
by, could not give him. Acting Super
intendent Dabney, who was in the place
of Superintendent Ford, at the head of
a force of willing workers, for hours
was endeavoring to remove the bodies
from the car as it floate* around the
river, sometimes showing itself halfway
above the surface of the water, and then
going under, being drawn to the surface
again by the ropes the railroad men suc
ceeded in getting around it. He did not
succeed until io o'clock to night.
J. H. Land is supposed to be a poor
farmer from Newton, who is thuoght to
have had his family in the emigrant car
with him when he was plunged to death.
The river is hard to work in, and
great caution had to be taken so that the
men would not get mixed up in a dread
ful eddy just where the car floats.
The big transfer boat Pelican, the
new boat which has not yet been in
service, lies just in the rear of where
the floating car lies, the old boat being
still in service. The new boat is ready
to be commissioned next week.
Your correspondent, who was the
only newspaper man to go right to the
scene tonight, found Yard Master Dunn,
who told the following story of the ac
cident:
"I was present when switch engine
No. 404, in charge of Engineer Mooney,
started to back a half dozen cars down
the incline. How the cars broke loose I
can not say, but they .started and flew
down the incline, which is about Zoo
yards long, at a rapid rate, and there
was no way to stop their flight. I heard
streams from the man in the car, but
whether there were more people in the
car with him I can not say. The car ran
over the transfer boat and clear through
her back end and dropped off her stern
into the river, where it broke loose from
the others and floated about in the river
for several hundred feet.
"The men stood around and could not
do anything and it was awful not to be
able to give any assistance."
From a man who says he say the way
bills of freight train No. 31, your cor
respondent learns that Land had his
family with him, and he had a car or so
of stock moving from Newton, Miss., to
Monroe, La.
Several doctors went down to the
transfer station, but they were of no
service, as no sounds were heard from
the unfortunates in the car after a short
time after the accident.
Acting Superintendent Dabney has
the wrecking train on the scene, and is
now engaged in pulling out the cars in
the water, but it is thought that it will
be impossible to get at the car in which
the people are until morning.
The Vicksburg, Shreveport and Pa
cific transfer incline is a peculiarly sit
uated place. It is about two miles below
the city proper, and the trains of this
road have to descend a precipitous in
cline and considerable trestle work be
fore they get to where the run of sev
eral hundred yards to the transfer boat
is standing out in the Mississippi river.
At this hour, to p.m., three bodies,
those of a young man, an elderly man
and a boy, have been removed from the
car in the river. The search will be con
tinued and the car pulled from the river
by midnight.
