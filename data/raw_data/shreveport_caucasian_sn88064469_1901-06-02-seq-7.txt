Loeb syndicate in the struggle fur the
control of the Northern Pacific road.
The friendliest feeling now exists and
an agreement has practically been reach

Pacific railroad owns over $59,000,t00 in

Fion ipr"i.e is the cinie a: usual at expo
sitions. hnlf a dollar, but it cntitles .hne
to a full day at the most beautiful fes
tival of the kind that has ever been
Irought into existence. No pen will
ibe so presumnptuous as to attempt to
describe the architectural and color
beauty of the Pan-American Exposi
tion. It is a nagnificent, an extr:iva
gant, dream Ibrought to a harmoniour
end beautiful realization. The triumlp111
of the architect, the colorist, the land
scape architect, the sculptor and the
electrician is complete.
There are about 150 buildings in the
Exposition plot. of all sizes and de
scriptions, and an abundance for every
one to see, no matter how long he may
choose to remain. The most novel ex
hibits perhaps are to be found in the
Electricity building, for in that partic
ular science wonderful strides have
been madtle within the last few yra:is.
Notably among these is the transform
er plant, where 5,000 horsepower is re
ceived from Niagara Falls by cable at
a pressure of 11,000 volts and stepped
down to .SI00 volts. This power is
used for lighting the vart Exposition
area. A dayliPhit brilliancy will per
vade the E::,,i.sition until 11 o'clock
each night. The exhibit of Street Rail
way appliances Is also of a very com
plete and interesting character. The
exhibit made by Thomas A. Edison,
showing the development of many of
his important lnventions, constitutes
another attractive feature. Demonstra
tions are to be made of Wireless Te
legraphy and the X Rays. In the cen- I
ter of the Machinery and Transporta
tion building Is a working exhibit of a
large number of Pumping Engines.
These supply the water for the various
fountain features of the Exposition.
Anmong these water displays is a cas
cade In the southern face of the Elec
tric Tower, from which there is a flow
of 85.000 gallons of water per minute,
making a beautiful vellike cataract 70
feet high. Upon this cataract electric
lights of many colors will be thrown
from an Invisible source, producing an
enchanting picture.
One of the most Imposing buildings'
of the Exposition is the great Stadium.
This is more than 60 feet high and is
so large as to Inclose a quarter mile
track. The seats are arranged In the
form of a vast amphitheater. and the
capacity is sufficient for 12,000 specta
tors. This Is to be the scene of very
interesting events daily throughout the
Exposition.
The Midway is said to be the great
est that bas ever been organized for
any exposition. The Midway proper
PRIIDENT JOHN O. MI.LBtR.Y.
is 3.000 feet long. thus giving more
than a mile of frontage upon this sin
gular thoroughfare. There are about
40 shows. every one of them possess
Ing special merit and selected from a
large number offered. There has been
great rihalry among show people to
secure space upon the Midway, and It
has been allotted with great care and
with the positive assurance that every
feature would be of a character to com
mand popular interest
It may be said of the whole Expo
sition that to every department it is
a compact yet complete presentation
of Twentieth Century civilization of
the Western World. _ .
