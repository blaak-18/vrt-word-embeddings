The late Constitutional Convention I
was unable to obtain $25,000 from the I
State treasury to defray its exoen- i
see, over and above the $40,000 allow

to control the funods in the Treasury
above the amount appropriated by

By the Constitution proposed by,

teeniwd by all who knew her, she carries
to the grave their deepest sorrow. She
departed in the prime of life leaving to
mourn her loxes a venerable mother, a
noble husband and an endless concourse
of true friends. To them we extend our
protfiundest sympathy in this their sad

not thy departure because we feel that
our Heavenly Father in his great glory
has plulcked the flower from this gardenl
of woe to transplant it in a soil for nore
fertile, far lruie beautiful than this.
There she rests happy, thrice happyv
with the angels of heaven. 0! Emma;

thee ! God knows how lmuch; for your
gentle disposition endeared thee to all.
Alas! t'is sad to think thou art no more,
lbut oh ! how sweet t'is to think of thee !
Yes, thy lmemnory shall ever le cherished.
Farewell, Emma, nothing is left of thee
now nllt thy melllmory.

Dear Sir-I have tried the disincrustant you
are the agent tfor thoroughly. We have been
using it for several weeks. I did this as a per
Mnall favor to you, for I generally dislike ma
king experiments. I can only say that I am
glad that 1 have given the disincrustant a trial
for it has turned out by far the best thing of
the kind that I ever used. It conime up to all its g
claims on its printed circular, and in future I
shall recommend Messrs. A" Thompson & Co..
to use it etcluslvely in their Ioilers over and
in preference to any other process for discrust*
ing boilers.
I remain, very respectfully,
