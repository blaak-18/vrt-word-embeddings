The report of the Times-Demo
crat's special representative of the
accident which happened during
the excursion of the Agricultural
Society to Grand Ecore last week
was greatly exaggerated. It is
true that the coaches became un
coupled from the engine on an in
considerable trade of the roadbed,
but thai there was at any time any
iminent danger to the passengers is
absolutely untrue. At the rate of
speed at which the train was going
there was almost an inipossibility
of the coaches leaving the track.

Mr. E. J. Gamble, the popular
front street merchant, has sold his
business to Messrs. J. H. Williams,
J. T. O'Quinn, and R. L. Weaver
who heretofore conducted a mer
chantile business in Montgomery.
The PoPrurIT wishes them success,
but regrets that the retirement of
Mr. Gamble may perhaps lose to
Natchitoches a valuable and sub
stantial citizen.

The cold wave which passed over
North Louisiana last Saturday
night and Sunday morning was
felt here. In fact there was a
slight fall of snow all day Sunday
followed by sleet. The weatt'r,
however, moderated Monday morn
ing and the icy visitor soon iiwep
peared. We have heard of no
sufcring eassed from it, and we
rejoice that the cold spell was of
no longer duration.

Grand Liquidation Sale at
H. SIMON & SONS.
Fifteen Thousand Doflars $15000 worth
OF DRY GOODS, NOTIONS, CLOTHING, BOOTS,
SHOES, HATS AND FURNISHING GOODS,
TO BE SOLD AT
JUST EXACTLY WHAT THEY COST.
We take this means of informing the public that we are going to retire from business, and in or
der to dO so as iquicki s.possible, we offer our entire stock at JUST EXACTLY WRAT IT COST.
It makes no difference what you want, Staple or Fancy goods, they all go at what they COST, for
we must dispose of the stock. Since we commenced selling our stock at coat, our store has been
been crowded from morning until night, which proves very conclusively, that the purchasing pub
lie appreciate the opportunity to buy goods, and'desirable goods at cost, and have taken advantage
of the chance to save money. All that is necessary is to come and examine our stock and get our
prices, and you will see what a saving it is to buy goods at coat. In this issue of the POPULIST we
mention the cost ot a few articles, merely to show you what it means to buy goods at cost.
We would prefer to sell our entire stock to one party, and lease the storehouse to them, therefore,
if there are any one desiring to engage in a good and profitable business, we would be pleased for
them to call and see us. We will sell the stock at a considerable reduction. Our only reason for
retiring from business is that we are going to a large city.
