Now the Venetian republic iue

ter. rich and poI crful.
Ilencie, a claim against the govern
ment i a. peirfecrtly tcood, and the
people doin; busilness with each other
preferred tiese claiiums against thet
go ''rnment to either gold or silver.
For instance, slluppose a merchant
of Venice held a claim of 1(NO ducats
against thli g overnmint. he "wishes to
buy goodtis Iloom a miierchlant in uon
stantinople to the amount of 1,ut
ducats: to suod t:ie gold or silver wa,
dangerous anlltl costly: to send a trans
fcr of his clain against the govern
mentt was safe and cheap; the mer
ciharit in ('onstantinopie preferred the
claim against the government to gold
or silver, because it gas equally valu
able and more easily kept; hence the
transactionr between the two mer
chants was closed, to their mutual
satisfaction and benefit, by the trans
fer of the debt which one of them
held against the government.
These government credits wete pre
ferred by the Venetian traders for
many of the reasons which at this
day create such a ravenous hunger
for the bonds
Bonds are mere government cred
its, yet we have just seen how eager
ly gold is exchanged for them.
'Ine bank of Venice, founded upon I
this loan of 2,l00),oo ducats, was a
government bank. At the beginning
it was merely a ,-chamer of loans." ;
The credits we have spoken of sup- t
plied the circulating medium. Tile
transfers of these credits upon the
books of the bank was equivalent to t
so much money changing hands. a
In 1423 a cash offtice was added and "I
the bank of Venice received and re- t
turned cash deposits.
In 1687 a discount office was added.
Thus we see the great republic of I
the Venetian cities running, for hun- i
dreds of years, a bank which had the
three departments of the modern
bank--circulation, deposit and dis
count.
But the two latter departments I
never interferea with the original ss- t
temrn of transferable credits used in '
the payment of debts. t
At first the government allowed 4
per cent. interest on the loans. In
1453 the interest was abolished and t
thereafter none was paid. I
At first the loan was made on the e
promuse of repayment. Soon the a
transfer system became so much more a
convenient and desireable, as a circu
lating medium, that no one wished a
for repayment. All preferred to hold
claims against the government. Con- t
sequently, In 1423, all promise of re- I
imbursement was abolished.
After 1425 whenever a citizen gave
his gold in exchange for government.
credit he could never demand the
gold again.
No coin was kept as a specie basis
of credit. No *gold reservo" maniac
had then been discovered and wor
shipped as a statesman. t
The bank lived 40) years after it
had ceased to promise to return gold
for gold. It lived on the strength of c
the government, and on the demand c
for a cheaper and more convenient C
way of making settlements than with
gold and silver coins.
The cremllt money of the Bank of u
Veaice was not only as good as gold
all ever the republic and throughout
the territory its commerce Invaded, f
but it commanded a premium of 20
per coet over gold. i
The amount of this credit money
which was worth a tifth more than
gold amounted to $16.0000,0i0.

tom' This was done after the payment by
it the bond syndicate of 76.51t2.7:3. the

ur- treasury from the syndicate of gold
Lsoe directly brought from Europe to the
-nt. date when the secretary of the treas
ury certitied to a completion of the
ov- contract was $15,554.i72.
nm.1 The remainder making up the total
of the European gold required by
ing contract was furnished by the syndi
cate from gold obtained in the United
rn- States.
Which means that the syndicate
Ige has supplied $1,;,01'2,165 in gold from
isd gold in the United States. instead of
in fultillment of the contract by bring
ing it from Europe.
the This is another out-and-out swindle
w- upon the American people, for which
to the people get no compensation, and
wholly and inexcusably in behalt of
the Rothschild '-ring.'
,nd The present quotation of these
bonds in the open market is $124.
of The price paid by the syndicate to
cir this government was $114.50, leaving

on the dollar of the entire loan, or,
tnt the total sum of $12,15O.7;;0 net, and

paid and guaranteed to be paid this
syndicate for its $15,545,972 of Euro

he All this is to protect the United

lat days from now, as foreign exchange

Comment is superfluous. It is hard

si- ited to the American Merchant and
business man that such robberies are

are looked upon by the vast goldbug
press as patriotic acts in behalf of the
general good.
Net ow another point: Mr. Morgan
of this syndicate, returns from abroad
and says Europe is buying American
Ssecurities. By dispatches just re. 1
Sceived from England, it is shown that I
the Rothschild financial journals in
o England are advising the selling of

ly of humanity why have the people i
ie been thus robbed. I

True. But what of thatP The

ment for labor. and capital are grow
ing less. 'this has been the case
with every gold standard country in
the world for the last twenty years.
It has not been the case with any sil
ver standard country in the world.
2. 'There is not a gold standard

not use silver money along with

T'rue. Which prove, that the
world cannot get along without sil\er
money.
;'. "There is not a silver standard

True. Which proves that the

money.
i. "-l'n re is nte at ster standard

more than one-third of the circula
tion, per capita,. that the 'United

Intrue. If all countries are to be
classed by the gold and ilc(r stand
ards. lrance must oc' placed in the
silver class. It certainly is not a gold
standard country. because it, slver
and paper are not based on or redeem
able in gold on demand. France has
a greater per capita circulation than
is claimed by the secretary of the
treasury for the United States. The
statement is untrue for the further
reason that the United states has not
in circulation more than one-third as
much money as is claimed by the sec
retary of the treasury. If .IMr. (ar
lisle's 4th, proposition was true, it is
a dodge and an attempt to make a
false Imoression. \Why make comn
parison with the United states. If
a gold standarid is what makes the in
creased circulation why not make the
comparison with and all gold standard
countries:' Because the statement
would have been too grossly and pal
pably untrue.
5. "There is not a silver standard
country in the world to-day where
the laboring man receives fair pay
for his day's work."
If this be true of silver standard
countries, it is also true of gold stand
ard count.:'es. The demand for and
the price of labor and labor's pt oducts
have greatly declined in every gold
standard country in the world during
the last twenty years. They hale
not materially declined in any silver
standard country in the world.
I challenge denial of any of
these statements made above in
reply to Mr. ('arlisle's maxims, or
the deductions that I have drawn
from the facts stated.-C. ii. Jenkins
in Living Issues.
(Clevelantd's Bilmetallism.
Not a single sliver dollar was coined
in the mints of the United States last
month. The total gold coinage was
$I ,91l,000, or at the rate of C34,920,
UdO per annum. This is a shade less
than 50 cents a year of new money of
ultimate redemption for each person
in the United States, to meet the de
mands of a population that increases
nearly 2,u00,I000 in that time and is
constantly opening new resources and
new regions. The report of the
bureau of statistics of the treasury
department showed the total amount
of gold coin in circulation on June 1
to be $483.770,430 and of gold cer
titicates against gold in the treasury
$48,53 8.5r69. ()f the aggregate, t.:;2,
309,999, more than one-half is laid
i away in bank resources and private
holdings. Under the infamous treas
ury rulings making silver certificates
redeemable in gold the whole fabric
of business rests on this narrow base.
No wonder the gold owners oppose bi
metallism. -Denver News.
Exactly Correct.
There are actually well meaning
men who imagine the Democratic
party can be reformed and made to
represent the interests of the people.
but these men are about a quater of a
century behind the times. Thous
ands of earnest men have tried this
feat before, with no good result save
to convince them that they had sim
ply been acting the part of chumps in
trying to cut the rotten out of a bad
egg.--Thornton's St. Louis Monitor.
It is ailly,
'he foolishness of the goldite Be
publican howl that there would be
danger, under free coinage, of Europe
shipping its sliver here is ridiculously
absurd. Last year the countries of
the old world had to buy #j4,000,000O
in silver bullion to supply their own
needs. Such truth as this is what
causes little pewter-faced dailies to
try to straddle and ride the golden
calf and free silver horse, each going
in an opposite direction, at the same
time.- Macomb Eagle.
Ii the goldbug gentry and their
hireling press can do no better than
denounce Populists as socialists, com
munists and anarchists, their cause is
gone; for the people have learned the
meaning of these words, and know
that the millionairs are the real anar.
chiste of our country.
BoND issues multiply. Every coun
ty and town and city in the nation al
most is issuing bonds, more boads.
Who is going to pay all these
bonds? We owe $40,000,00,00 now,
with only $18,000,000,(000) of taxable
