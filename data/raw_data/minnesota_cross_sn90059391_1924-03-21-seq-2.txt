BELLE PLAINE, IA., March 18— The following letter was re
cently forwarded to Smith W. Brookhart, United States senator
from lowa, by the American-born citizens of Belle Plaine and sur
rounding country. The senator is requested to use his influence in
obtaining the enactment of the Johnson restrictive immigration
bill, which is soon to come before the house of representatives,
having already been reported favorably out of committee.
The letter was accompanied by a
petition signed with hundreds of
names, voicing the sentiment of the
people in that locality.
Americans in other parts of lowa
should get up similar petitions and
letters and send them to their rep
representatives as well as senators.
The representatives should be ad
dressed first, because in their hands
lies the decision as to whether or not
the Johnson bill, or a similar meas
ure. will ever reach the senate.
Text of Letter
The text of the letter accompany
ing the petition, is as below:
Herewith enclosed you will find pe
tition which was circulated in this
city relative to the Johnson restrict
ive Immigration Bill, which will soon
be in line for consideration.
Kindly be advised that the signers
of this petition made their signa
tures with a very determined inten
tion that same be given your person
al attention when this bill comes up
for action, and request that you as
our representative use your influence
and vote to have same made a law,
basing the number of foreign immi
grants to this country on the census
as taken of the year 1890.
U. S. Not Pumping Ground
Inasmuch as it is a fact that for
eign elements and capitalistic influ
ences are contriving every available
means to have this bill killed or pig
eon-holed and another substituted,
we take this means to advise you ex
actly how we stand and what action
we desire to take regarding this mat
ter. To be frank, we are very decid
edly opposed to having a dumping
grounds made of our country for the
foreign element which we have been
receiving from southern Europe and
Eastern Asia.
We contend that these elements
tend to lower the American standard
of living, produce unemployment for
our American born citizens, produces
an element no respect for
law and order, k»ower the efficiency
of our American institutions, and
last but not least we do not care to
see the time when our grandchildren
attempt to assimilate these races of
people, which will be an absolute ne
cessity if we are to make them good
American citizens.
As it is a recognized fact that these
people are now settled in eastern
states in little cities by themselves,
do not observe our national holidays,
do not send their children to the

come citizens of the country from
whence they came, we are of the
opinion they are tending to under
mine our great American fundamen
tal principles, which were established
by our fore-fathers who fought and
bled, and suffered the privations
which were necessary to make these
United States of America what they
are today, and we believe that in
stead of these people being an asset
to the further advancement of our
government and development of our
country that they will be a detri
ment and burden upon our govern
ment, inasmuch as the statistics for
the state of New York and other
eastern states show that the inmates
of the penal institutions and insane
institutions are of a very high per
centage of the foreign born and un
naturalized foreigners.
Americans Want Law
On the political side of this ques
tion it is very evident that from the
attitude taken by some of our east
ern representatives, foreign influ
ences are being pressed to the ut
most as we cannot conceive of any
other reason for any man. who is a
good American citizen, and has
America’s interest at heart advising
that the portals of this country be
opened wide to all who may seek en
trance. and meet them with out
stretched arms and say to them,
“Welcome to our shores, take what
you may.” We do not believe that a
good American citizen would allow
foreign influences to lower his patri
otism to such an extent that he
would even think of making such a
statement to be heralded throughout
the country even through the natral
ized and unnaturalized foreigners
were in a majority in his particular
state, we consider it very unjust
treatment to the American born
citizen of his state and other states
of the union, and the same should
not be given<*ny consideration what
ever or have any bearing on the
question of immigration as we are of
the opinion that he was not voicing
the request of the American citizens
of his state in making such an out
rageous statement. We are of the
type of citizens who believe in the
motto, “One country, one flag, and
one language,” and we fear that if
the foreign element which we have
been receiving in this country con
tinue to pour in that we will be
forced to stand by and see our motto
broken on account of their influence.
We consider it every 100 per cent
American citizen’s duty to request
that we receive into this country im
migrants of the very highest intel
lect and those who are allowed de
clare their intentions of becoming
naturalised at the earliest possible
date after arrival in this country,
and that none be allowed to leave
the shores of a foreign country who
will not meet the requirements of
the highest possible standards.
Will assure you that we have ex
pressed the opinion of the majority
of the native born Americans of the
state of lowa.

his heart to the fiery cross.

PRESENT KLAN REGIME
AGAINST LAWLESSNESS
Ousting of E. Y. Clarke Was Good
Move—Convicted of Violat
ing Mann Act
(liurrau ot Publiention and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 11.—
Klansmen loyal to the present or
ganization cannot help but feel that
a good housecleaning has been going
on in getting rid of such members
and officers as E. Y. Clarke, of At
lanta, who has just plead guilty in
federal court to violating the Mann
act, and was fined $5,000 by Judge
J. C. Hutcheson Jr., at Houston,
Texas.
The charge involved the former
Klan officer and a young Houston
woman. It was alleged that Clarke
transported her to New Orleans in
February, 1921.
“You have entered a plea of guilty,
which show’s that you have gone a
long way toward making restitution,”
the judge said. “If you had pleaded
not guilty and tried to lie your way
out of it, I would have sent you to
the penitentiary.”
The woman in thecase was in court
as sentence was passed. All of which
goes to show the Ku Klux Klan did
right in ousting Clarke from his offi
cial position sometime ago. The pres
ent administration has no use for
for any official who wilfully violates
the laws of his country.
KLAN ENEMY GOES
OUT OF BUSINESS
Wallace, W. Va., Man Was Chair
man of National Vigilance
Association
WALLACE, W. VA., March 17
O. R. Kincaid, who has been in the
merchantile business here for the
past four years, and who recently
announced that he is chairman of
the national vigilance association in
Harrison county, has advertised his
business for sale.
According to the tone of the ad
vertising bills it is a forced sale.
Kincaid has had his property adver
tised for sale in certain publications
for the past few weeks. Although it
cannot be verified it is said that de
creases in business is the cause of
Kincaid’s move.
An advertising bill says: “Every
body welcome regardless of race,
color or religion." Kincaid has not
made a statement as to where he ex
pects to go or as to whether or not
he will again enter the merchantile
business.
The national vigilance association
is the ghost of a movement started
sometime ago to bust the Klan. It
is said that the emblem of the or
ganization is a fiery circle. A mem
ber of the vigilantes at Wallace told
the writer of this article that they,
the vigilantes, had two to one more
members than the Klan. Whether or
nor Kincaid will remain in the capa
city of county chairman is not
known.

CLARGSBURG, W. VA., March 18.
—The Rev. W. M. Burns, Mt. Lake
Park, Md., delivered a patriotic lec
ture to members of the Women of
the Ku Klux Klan at the local Klan
Klavern Monday night last. The Rev.
Mr. Burns advocated education for
foreigners that are now in the Unit
ed States and declared that a strict
immigration law should be passed
that would prohibit “undesirable
foreigners" from coming into this
country. The minister also declared
that he was a firm believer in white
supremacy but said that the only
way we can have white supremacy is
for the white race to make itself
such.

WHAT FORD WILL DO
UNDER SHOALS BILL
Representative La Guardia Calls
Teapot Dome “Petty Larceny"
Compared to Ford's Offer
(llurenu of I’uhl leaf lon and (education)
WASHINGTON, D. C.. March 17.
Under the bill the house of repre
sentatives has just passed here is
what Henry Ford will do at Muscle
Shoals.
Lease dams 2 and 3 at Muscle
Shoals, Alabama, for 100 years, the
lease to be granted to a $10,000,000
corporation formed by Ford.
Complete dams 2 and 3, providing
water for production of power.
Pay the government annual rental
of 4 per cent plus $55,000 for main
tenance and repair.
Purchase nitrate plants 1 and 2,
and the Waco quarry, paying the gov
ernment $5,000,000.
Manufacture a minimum of 40,000
tons of nitrate for fertilizer annual
ly and sell it to farmers at a pro
fit not greater than 8 per cent.
WASHINGTON, D. C.. March 7.
In discussing in the house of repre
sentatives Henry Ford’s offer to buy
Muscle Shoals some warm things
were said about the Detroit manu
facturer and Michigan would-be
politician. Representative La Guar
dia Republican of New York, who is
of Italian parents and who boasts
that his race gave the world its lit
erature and poetry made a bitter
personal attack on Mr. Ford.
The New’ York congressman declar
ed that if given Muscle Shoals Mr.
Ford would become the “industrial
king” of the nation. Should the De
troit manufacturer be given control
of the nitrate plants, Mr. La Guardia
said, the government would not know
in what condition they might be if
war should develop. He added that
it was possible in the event of war
that Mr. Ford might be “bound on a
peace ship trying to get the boys
out of the trenches,” adding that
the only person Mr. Ford got out of
the trenches was “his own son.”
Mr. La Guardia declared that Mr.
Ford “through insidious propaganda.”
was responsible for the massacre of
the Jews in Poland in 1919 and 1920,
and that giving Muscle Shoals to the
manufacturer w’ould “make Teapot
Dome look like petty larceny.”
“It would even be worse than the
Teapot leases.” Mr. La Guardia said,
for in the oil case it may be possible
to countermand the leases through
the courts. Turning partly around
so as to face the speaker’s stand,
back of which hangs an American
flag. Mr. La Guardia said giving Mus
cle Shoals to Mr. Ford would be
"tearing down the American flag and
putting the dollar sign in its place.”
Representative Boylan, Democrat,
of New York, took up the debate,
and, also turning so the he partly
faced the flag, asked if Mr. La Guar
dia would “tear down the American
flag and raise the British ensign.”
Both Representatives La Guardia
and Boylan, of New York, represent
foreign districts and both men are
fighting the immigration measure
day and night.

CHICAGO, March 6.—“ The “ap

forces in the Minnesota county con

declared today.
“The machine can control the nom

that state show it cannot control be

statements said.
“The result was expected. The ma

KLAN AIDS IN RAID
Member of City Council and Oth
ers Arrested by Special
Deputies
SPENCER W. VA., March 17.
Three men, one a member of the lo
cal city council, and four women
were arrested, and one gallon of al
cohol and a quantity of wine was
seized, when local officers, assisted
by deputized members of the Ku
Klux klan, raided the home of H. J.
Simmons, prominent Spencer business
man. The raid was made in the ab
sence of Simmon’s wife who is in a
Parkersburg hospital.
When arraigned before a local
justice of the peace, the four wom
en, who are said to hail from Park
ersburg, gave ficticious names. The
men were: A. Casto, member of the
local city council; H. J. Simmons, lo
cal business man, and Monty Baker,
of Parkersburg. The sextette plead
ed guilty and each drew fines of S2O
and costs.
Simmons was held for the grand
Jury on a charge of having liquor in

Mohammedan Expansion
In view of the address made in Des
Moines recently by Dr. G. C. Minor,
of the national lecture bureau of the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. in
which the rise of the colored races of
the world was discussed in a most
scholarly fashion, the following edi
torial from a recent issue of The
New York Times ,is of unusual inter
est.
The editorial, dealing in particular
with the Mohammedan question, is
as follows:
Mustapha Kemal’s finis to the Cali
phate was presumably dictated by
the logic of domestic Turkish poli
tics, Such prestige as the Angora
government derived from its connec
tion with the spiritual head of the
great body of Mohammedans was pre
sumably counterbalanced by the dan
ger of a rival power in the state,
about which conceivably a counter
revolution might center. Possibly
Kemal Pasha shared the opinion of
his former soviet friends that reli
gion is the opiate of the people. But
we need not be surprised if the An
gora nationalists discover that per
haps there is a practical side to re
ligion, if religious institutions can
be captured and utilized for one’s
particular set of ideas. Parallel to
the creation in Soviet Russia of a
new church, largely as a political in
strument, the new Turkey may yet
witness the revival of a transformed
Caliphate with a purely utilitarian
purpose.
Merely as a matter of statistics,
there is a certain propriety in the
disappearance of the Turkish Cali
phate. Before the war Turkey, with
a population of about fifteen mil
lions, embraced perhaps 7 per cent of
the Mohammedan population of the
world. There were nearly four and
a half times as many followers of
Islam in British India as in the larg
est of the independent Moslem coun
tries. Today Turkey with a poula
tion of twelve millions is not even
the leading independent nation in
Islam, though in a military sense she
is still obviously the first. Egypt has
a million and a half more inhabit
ants. Persia is a very close second
to Turkey with ten million inhabit
ants, though not of the orthodox
Sunnite faith. Afghanistan with an
extremely warlike population of more
than six millions is now, in an inter
national sense, the second state in
Islam. Strategically situated on the
flank of India, Afghanistan will con
tinue to play an important part as
a buffer state in peace and a menace
in troubled times. That role will
continue to be of increasing import
ance until soviet Russia’s intentions
with regard to the populations of the
middle east, which means India, have
been clarified
Whether the Pan-Islamic problem,
to which European statesmen gave
much thought before the war, will
now have to be reckoned with, once
the spiritual union of the Moslem
world has been broken is doubt
ful. The bonds of race cannot
be expected to take the place of
the bonds of religious communion,
because there is no overwhelming
community of race in Islam. Ethnolo
gically it is the most diversified of
the great world religions. It ranges
all the way from the white tribes
men of the Caucasus to the peoples
of Central Africa. It includes more
than ten million Chinese and thirty
five million Malays and Negroids in
the East Indies and Oceanica. In Cen
tral Africa it has been the testimony
of Christian observers that Moham
medanism has been first in winning
the natives away from paganism, and
tribute has been paid in other res
pects to the civilizing influence of
the spread of the Islamic teaching.
The rise of great missionary or cru
sading orders like the Senussi and
outbreaks like Mahdism have been
taken as evidence of an abundant
vitality in the Mohammedan faith.
What the future must show is whe
ther this faith will demand the re
storation in Turkey or elsewhere, of
a visible head of Islam.
AMERICA NEEDS
HERO WORSHIP,
TEACHERS TOLD
W. F. Webster of Minneap
olis Schools Talks at
Fargo, N. D.
MUST STIR IMAGINATION
Old Days of Teaching by Objects
Has Passed—Sees New Edu
cational Vision
FARGO, N. D., March 17.—Ameri
ca needs to come back to the wor
ship of heroes, “who neglect the al
lurements of wealth and power to
hold honor above all else, and who
believe that their greatest distinc
tion is in their name, American,”
W. F. Webster, superintendent of
the Minneapolis schools, told winter
term graduates of the Moorhead
State Teachers’ college at their com
mencement exercises here recently.
Speaking on the subject, “Imagina
tion in Education,” Mr. Webster rais
ed the question whether “things, just
things, are killing the imagination
today,” and suggested that the so
called practical subjects in schools
may be relatively unimportant.
Mr. Webster is a former resident
of Moorhead, where he was superin
tendent of schools 30 years ago.
“The most wonderful thing we
should be doing is not to teach geo
graphy or any other so-called prac
tical subject, but to form a beauti
ful life, he said. “Each child is
raising a temple of his spirit. It
may be ugly or lovely; that will de
pend upon the imagination of those
who build, his parents, teachers,
self.
Stress Citizenship
“The temple must contain health
as a foundation; skill; discriminating
tastes; worthy citizenship; and love
of truth and honor. While all should
be there in due proportion to make a
perfect life, just now our attention
is centered on one—citizenship.
“These are shameful days. Six
years ago we were proud of Ameri
ca because of what she had done. We
saw our country, the beautiful, our
ideal clad all in white; but today
that robe is splotched and the eyes
drop down with shame. We men and
women, citizens of this republic, have
not cared, and the result of our in
difference is our present disgrace.
“As teachers we must come back
to the worship of heroes. In this
hall of heroes we place first that im
perial man, cast in massive mold,
that unblemished gentleman, George
Washington; and beside him Lincoln,
new product of a new soil, the first
American; and in these later days,
Roosevelt, unafraid, firmly for right,
daring to smite evil without favor;
and Wilson, who nobly failed, yet in
his failure showed a new world where
the noblest rivalry shall be for the
the people.”
Numbers Unimportant
In discussing the value of parti
cular subjects in the curriculm, Mr.
Webster called attention to the
changes recent years have wrought
in their relative importance. “Num
bers. considered the most practical
subject of all, is today pernaps the
least needed subject in the school
course. With machines used so ex
tensively in business offices, there is
little need for skill on the part of
an employe. What a business wants
is a man who is intelligent and hon
est.” In teaching numbers, the child
should be forced to use his imagina
tion, not to depend upon subjects,
Mr. Webster said. He called atten
tion to the modern possibilities of
conceiving big numbers. Radio, aero-
E lanes and other modern inventions
ave opened up such a new world
that a child can now imagine the
distance to the sun,” he said.
Geography, too has “ceased to be a
subject where names of cities and ri
vers are learned like the multiplica
tion table, and now is a subject deal
ing with human beings,” he said.
“The world has become a little thing
around which the child can see, and
his neighbors are all mankind.”
Imagination is very necessary in
reading, he pointed out. “A man
cannot create literature unless he
has imagination, nor can he read it
without imagination. We must have
imagines, pictures of things in mind
he said, “is the farthest reach of ex
pression in words.” Like the painter
in his picture, and the musician in
his composition, the poet in a stanza
“carries us away from the common
things to a new life, to a land be
yond the land of the senses.
Dare to See Future
“You are going into school rooms
to be surrounded by little children,
representing every race, speaking a
various language, having different

HAS HOUSE POWER TO
INVESTIGATE MEMBERS
Two Congressmen, Under Suspi
cion, Ask for Probe of
Their Affairs
(Bureau of Publication and Kducatlon)
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 11.-
Legal and ethical conduct of house
members and the power and right of
the house to investigate charges
against its members were discussed
in the house today in connection with
rumors reflecting on two congress
men.
Congressman Langley, of Kentucky,
and Zihlman, of Maryland, implicat
ed by rumors growing out of a grand
jury investigation of veteran bureau
matters, asserted to the house their
innocence of wrong doing and asked
an investigation by the house.
Attorney General Daugherty de
clined to give the specific charges
against the two congressmen, but
said if ordered by the house he would
lay it before it whatever the depart
ment of justice may have against all
members of congress, the house t«
assume responsibility for interfere
ence with justice should such result
The house judiciary committee
brought up today its report recom
mending the house that it proceed
no further with an investigation of
the grand jury charges. It held the
entire matter should be left to the
attorney general for such action as
he should determine ought to be tak
en in the specific cases or such as
the evidence in possession of the de
partment of justice warranted.

Seven Fiery Grosses
ROSEMONT, W. VA„ March 18.—
A touch of the unusual was experi

when the grand total of seven fiery
crosses burning simultaneously in
two different communities, were dis
cernable from local streets. While
four crosses blazed forth on the hills,
surrounding this town three blazing
emblems also seen burning on the
eminences sheltering Flemmington,
a small town about two and one half
miles from here. The Women of the
Ku Klux Klan are said to have burn
ed one of the large crosses that were
seen here. The exact reason for the
brilliant spectacle is not known. It
is thought, however, that it signifies
a large increase in the local member

you see? A level seeing man and a

Fifteen diplomas were presented
by Dr. O. J. Hagen, resident director
of the teachers’ college. The program
included music by the chapel choir.
