The three Democrats present, anx

Pops that had been nominated at
the Populmt primary had received a
more votes than the Democratic
candidates. The commisuionersaf- i
ter considering the matter, decided j
(mad I think correctly) that the ij
Pops were not entitled to receive f
the nomiastios at a . Democrati

bhe a guarantee that the present
reign of fraud anl corruption shall
cease in the Corn monwealth-there I
fore, we adopt the following plat- t
form, for which we ask the suf- It
frage of all patriotic citizens:
PLATFORM
1. We affirm our allegiance to t
e the pure principles of popular Zov- t
t ernment, as enunciated by Wash
t ington, Jefferson and Jackson, and 1
embodied in our National platform, I
anl we uphold the principle em- I
.- bodied in the immortal declaration I
,, that this should be "a Government
sl of the people, by the people and
n for the people." 1
- 2. And especially do we de
mand the free and unlimited coin
n a~e of both gold and silver, at the
t ratio of 16 to 1, with equal debt
Spaying power as primary money,
I and a full legal tender monetary
system for the people of the Unit
ed States, without consulting any
foreign nation or money syndicate.
3. We demand for Louisianai
industries equal protection to that
U- afforded the industries of other
i States. An American, not a Brit
a ish system of commercial laws,
s. th t no discrimination against our
*'s acultural and industrial classes
may be made.
r- 4. We favor a just and liberal
e system of public schools for the I
k' benefit of all classes of our peoplc,
of and we deplore the fact that for
ce many years the management of
our public school system has booeen
e- so defective that the party now in
- power seeks to disfranchise a large
number of our citizens on the
grounds of ignorance.
5. V. e denounce the disgrace
r- ful and infamous election frauds
a which have prevailed in Louisiana,
.. and .we demand and are determin
ed to have a perfectly honest and
Sfair election, at which each citizen
Squalified to vote, shill cast his bal
P- lot freely and secretly, and the
s. vote shall be fairly counted as they
)k are actaally cast. This is the su
4 preme issue in this campaign, and
m its suceess the honor, manhood
andml prosperity of Louisiana are
