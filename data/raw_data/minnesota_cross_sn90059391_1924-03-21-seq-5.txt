DISCORD ELIMINATED
BY GOPHER G. O. P.
(Continued from page 1)
•of the Republican government of
Minnesota, all the delegates-at-large
were chosen by acclamation and no
record vote was taken on any candi
date. Strange as it may seem not a
•ingle delegate contest went before
the credential committee. The fol
lowing seven delegates at large and
their alternates were elected by the
/Republican state convention.:
Col. Charles H. March, Litchfield.
Charles N. Orr, St. Paul.
Fred A. Dickey, Minneapolis.
A. O. Moreaux, Luverne.
J. J. Rarhac, Faribault.
Mrs. P. I*. DeVoist, Duluth.
John IL Marks, Wadena.
Alternates
C. M. Berg, Mclntosh.
Louis L. Collins, Minneapolis.
Mrs. J. E. Rounds, St. Paul.
Dr. E. E. Christenson, Two Harbors.
Mrs. Lucv Hamplett, Park Rapids.
Mrs. S. M. Hanson, Tyler.
R. D. Sprague, Caledonia.
March Made Relegate
In that the convention did not act
any national committeeman, the
vonly two active candidates in the
field are State Senator William F.
Brooks and Fred H. Carpenter, both
x>f Minneapolis. Their campaign so
far has figured entirely in the Hen
nepin county convention, with in
dorsed Mr. Carpenter; the fifth dis
trict convention, which elected Sena
tor Brooks’ slate of delegates; and
the tenth district convention which
elected Carpenter’s delegates, and
instructed them for Mr. Carpenter.
What the final outcome will be no
„one can at this time accurately pro
jphensy.
Five Resolutions Adopted
Five resolutions all told were pass

.Natiftiiul Affairs and President
Whereas, a large majority of our
citizens, regardless of party, believe
in the singleness of purpose and in
tegrity of the present Republican
cjiief executive of the United States,
and
Whereas, they are convinced that
his wise and well considered con
duct of affairs amid the present ef
forts to stir up class hatreds and
partisan strife is deserving of all
commendation, and
Whereas, we share the confidence
of the vast majority that the present
chief executive, called to his high
office at the death of his distinguish
ed, high-minded, great hearted and
deeply mourned predecessor, will
continue to use those qualities of
cool-headedness and unswerving de
votion to the public welfare which
have ever marked his official conduct
during his long and honorable pub
lic carreer, and
Whereas, we believe that men who
have criminal designs on the nation
and its resources do not hestitate to
align themselves with which ever
political party is in power, and
Whereas, we believe it to be the
duty of the honest men and women
who compose the great majority of
the.rank and file of the Republican
party, both in state and nation to
prevent any sinister influences at
taining power in its councils, and
Whereas, we believe that the pres
ent chief executive of this nation is,
and throughout all his public career,
has been, one of the most powerful
instrumentalities against the misuse
of great political parties by those
with unworthy private ends to gain,
therefore, be it
Resolved, that we commend the
private character and public accom
plishments and utterances of Presi
dent Coolidge, to the consideration
of every thinking individual who
wishes to see right triumph over
wrong and real, courageous, honest
statesmanship over time-serving, un

Here’s Reproduction of Handbill Proclamation With
Which Sioux Rapids Mayor Advertised Klan Meeting
Mayor’s Proclamation
To The Law Abiding Citizens of Sioux Rapids, lowa
WHEREAS, It has been called to my attention as mayor of Sioux
Rapids, lowa, that an organizer an 1 speaker of the Ku Klux Klan is
Rapids, lowa, for the purpose of hoay night, March 10, 1924 in Sioux
to n » ret meeting on Mondlding a meeting to organize at Sioux
Rapids, lowa.
AND WHEREAS, Certain RED CARDS of admission have been
circulated and citizens solicited to attend.
AND WHEREAS, The organization is Un American and seeks
to rule through a masked minority and an invisable dictation and
contrary to the laws of our land, and whereas it tends to promote dis
cord and dissension, to tear down rather than build up and appeals to
hate and passion rather than fellowship and reason.
AND WHEREAS, Our state and national constitutions both gua
rantee freedom of speech.
AND WHEREAS, A duly appointed officer will be present at the
meeting to see that the privilege of free speech is not abused.
AND WHEREAS, The American Legion is holding a County
meeting in Sioux Rapids, lowa on that evening and the Methodist Re
vival Meetings will be in progress at the Methodist Church.
AND WHEREAS, some citizens through curiosity or other mot
ives might encourage through their presence at the Klan lecture, those
would be secret dictators of Sioux Rapids, lowa.
NOW THEREFORE, I, CHARLES E. PENDLETON, Mayor of
Sioux Rapids, wishing to preserve the good name of Sioux Rapids,
lowa, to maintain our open and visiable forms of government, to dis
courage those outside would-be dictators. RESPECTFULLY RE
QUEST the good citizens of Sioux Rapids, lowa, to refrain from at
tending the Ku Klux Klan gathering or listening to any of their lec
tures or in any way encouraging or molesting them in their meeting.
For those wishing to hear something worthwhile, I recommend the
American Legion Meeting or the Methodist revival meeting.
Chas. E. Pendlzton
Above is an exact reproduction of
the handbill proclamation with
which Mayor Charles E. Pendleton of
Sioux Rapids helped organize the Ku
Klux Klan in that city on Monday
night, March 10. “His Honor” had his
opinions, as set forth in the official
document, broadcast over the city
scrupulous demoguery, and, be it fur
ther
Resolved, that this man of silence,
of deliveration, of tremendous effi
ciency and ability possesses that
hold on the public which comes only
to men in whom the public recog
nizes those great natures whose de
cisions are made solely at the dic
tates of cinscience and without re
gard to the effect on their personal
and political fortunes; be it
further
Resolved, that we recognize in his
career a striking example of the pos
sibilities and opportunities afforded
by our country to the individual of
humble beginnings and dowered with
the slightest of financial resources;
that we commend his wisdom and
honesty; that we appreciate his realj
zation of the tremendous responsi
bilities of the position to which he
has been called; that we congratu
late the country on the marked suc
cess which has attended his efforts
to solve the numerous, intricate and
delicate problems which have con
fronted him from the momentt of
his assumption of his present office;
that we admire his steadfast exemp
lication of and devotion to the real
priciples of true Americanism; and
be it further
Resolved, that this convention
hereby instructs the delegates select
ed by it to represent the state of
Minnesota at the national Republi
can convention, to be held in the
city of Cleveland, state of Ohio, be
ginning on the 10th day of June,
1924, to vote for the nomination of
Calvin Coolidge for the office of pre
sident of the United States, and to
use your honorable means to secure
his indorsement by that convention,
believing as we do that by earnestly
dedicating ourselves and our repre
sentatives to his nomination and elec
tion we are best serving the welfare
of our common country and the
prosperity and happiness of every
man, woman and child who dwells
within its borders.
* • *
Recognition of Service Men
We recognize that the state nnd
nation owe a never-to-be forgotten
debt of gratitude -to the men who
served their country during the late
World war. Our state was among
the first to grant a soldiers’ bonus
and funds for special training of ex
service men. The Republican party
of Minnesota pledges its support to
the following matters in which ex
service men are interested:
Adequate and prompt aid to dis
abled war veterans.
Just application and enforcement
of the soldiers' preference act.
Adjusted compensation to ex-ser
vice men by the national government
and no unnecessary delay in develop
ing a method to obtain funds where
by sumo may he promptly paid.
THE FIERY CROSS
Mayor
Monday before the meeting. From
the results obtained by Klan organ
izers, it would seem, that instead ol
attending the Methodist revival
(worthy of public support as it is)
and the American Legion convention
(despite its high aims) as was sug
gested, the greatest number of men
were at the “secret” Klan meeting.
Agriculture
The Adamson act; the restrictive
immigration act; the transportation
act; the high tariff law and other
kindred legislation has resulted to
the advantage of labor and industry
and disadvantage of the farmer. This
system of governmental protection
has brought about a marked dispar
ity in prices between what the farm
er pays for, what he purchases and
what he receives for his products.
The purchasing power of the men and
women of the farm is only about 50
per cent of pre-war levels. This con
dition is fundamental and serious. It
must not be permitted to continue.
The best welfare of the nation is
menaced by the experience of this
organic defeat in our economic sys
tem. The purchasing power of the
farmer’s product must be equalized
on a parity with the prices obtained
in other industries. He must have
the same measure of protection af
forded others. Therefore, to meet and
correct this situation and in further
ances of the traditional policy of the
Republican party to stand for equal
rights to all, we do hereby indorse
and approve the principles of the Mc-
Nary-Haugen bill now pending in
congress and call upon our esteemed
president and the members of con
gress from this state to use their
earnest endeavors to secure the en
actment of the proposed legislation.
That copies of these resolutions be
forwarded to the president and the
members of congress of Minnesota.

Anti-Lynch and Moh Rule
Whereas, mob rule, lynching, inti
midation and coercion have grown
to an alarming extent in every part
of America; and
Whereas, this'defiance of the laws
of state and nation is a constant
menace to the transquility and well
being of our common country;
Therefore be it resolved, that the
Republican party of the state of
Minnesota in convention, assembled,
approve and indorse that part of the
national Republican platform of 1920
which calls for appropriate legisla
tion to check this growing evil.
Party Got eminent
Whereas, we conceive party gov
ernment to be fundamental to the
genuis of American institutions,
Now, therefore, be it resolved, that
we favor the enactment of a law by
the next legislature of this state
which will restore party designntions
to the candidacies of prospective
members of the legislature of this
st its,
Assistant secretaries nsmed from
the 10 districts were:
First District Grace Nye, H. A
Larson.
Second Mrs. Phil Lieschs, J G
Mott.
Third H. G. Dressell, Bertha Wei
bezohn.
Fourth Mrs. David Wallbloin, Fred
A. Snyder.
Besides taking the greatest share of
the honors for organizing the Klan,
the mayor walks off with all the
laurels when it comes to grammar,
spelling and punctuation. Despite
his efforts the “invisible” govern
ment is established in his little
kingdom in northwestern lowa. 'Sto

fer to obtain a divorce and then go
on honorably with the new affair of
the heart. Marriage was never so
free from materialism as it is in the
United States today.”
' Warns Against War
Prof. Ross pointed out how the
public attitude toward election re
sults has solidified the political fabric
of this country, but heralded the
danger of attempts to influence the
public mind through the control of
newspapers.
He warned of excessive preparation
for war, and the probable outcome
of the next war, with deadly gases
as the chief weapons. "Present de
velopments,” he said, "indicate that
the only survivors will be the mem
bers of the air fleet which goes .to
attack other countries.”
During the entire talk Prof. Ross
made no mention of evolution, the
subject which Dr. Riley gave as his
reason for the bitter attack on Prof.
Ross as a “scoffer at Christianity.”
The audience howled down a member
who sought to question the speaker
on astrology; other questions by
scores were asked and answered.
Prof. Ross left Madison last night
after being dinner guest of Prof. F.
Stuart Chapin, head of the Univer
sity of Minnesota sociology depart
ment.
Klan Favored Because
of Church Contribution
CLEVELAND. KAN.. March 17.
Surprising guests at a local church
social recently, a group of six robed
Klansmen entered the church and
presented the Rev. Mr. Butler, pas
tor, with an envelope containing
$l3O. After the leader explained the
principles of the great order, the
Knights were led in prayer by the
pastor after which they retired as
silently as they entered. The contri
bution has caused much favorable
comment toward the Klan in this
community.
So many fiery crosses have
been burned the past year that a
good many different degrees of
darkness are getting ashamed of
themselves.
THIRD PARTY FOR

election. He insisted the Cleveland
meeting not nominate candi
dates but would merely discuss them.
Thants From Mont ana
Thanks from the “bankrupt farm
ers” of Montana for Minnesota’s ac
tion in paving the way for the third
party meeting was expressed by
State Senator Charles E. Taylor, of
Montana.
“You’ve made history today and
you’ve shown our bankrupt farmers
of Montana that the Farmer-Labor
party of Minnesota has not failed the
northwest. The people are looking
to your party as their guiding star.
Montana will come down here with a
big delegation.”
A platform identical with the pub
lic ownership platform which the
Farmer-Labor federation a*lopted in
Minneapolis Thursday was adopted
by the state convention with the ad
dition of a few national policies, in
cluding urging a soldier bonus, gov
ernment operation of banks and a
child welfare bureau.
To Nominate Electors
The convention authorized the
state central committee to call a
subsequent state convention of the
party to nominate presidential elec
tors in anticipation of having a third
party candidate in the field. This
suggestion had been made by Mr.
Pike in his opening address when he
declared that Minnesota should vote
on its choice for president regardless
of what the Farmer-Labor parties of
other states do.
Plans now are to have fhe call for
the June 17 national convention in
the Twin Cities issued by the Farm
er-Labor party of Minnesota, which
will invite other liberal groups and
organizations to participate in the
gathering and the nomination ol
candidates for president and vice
president.

linquent children, to cooperate to
this end with juvenile courts and all
reputable child-helping and child
placing agencies of a public or pri
vate character, and to take the ini
tiative in all matters involving the
interests of such children where ade
quate provision therefore has not al
ready been made.
The magnitude of the work under
this law is shown by the reports of
the children’s bureau for the five and
one-half years ending June 30. 1923.
Cases relating to the welfare of
children, acted upon by the child
welfare boards were as follows:
Investigations of for tem
porary placement of children 1721.
Investigations of homes for adop
tion—2128.
Cases of unmarried mothers- 6413.
Feeble-minded, committed to the
state board of control 1543.
Miscellaneous cases of neglect, de
linquency, etc. —3175.
A total of 14,980.
In addition to this work, the board
inspected and certified:
Maternity hospitals—l9B.
Child-caring institutions —24.
Child-caring agencies—9o.
Boarding homes -219.
The child welfare hoard of each
county acts as the agent of the state
board of control in carrying on this
work. It cooperates with the coun
ty board of commissioners, the coun
ty attorney, and the juvenile and
district courts in a program of social
welfare which each community owes
towards its helpless and unfortunate.

“ ‘Suddenly I saw another car ap

“ The oncoming car was brought
to a stop beside my car, and two men,
whom I later learned to be deputy
sheriffs, jumped out. One flashed a
light into my car and demanded to

the law to park alongside the road.
I replied I aid not, but that if I was
violating the law I would move on.
At this point the officers said we were
under arrest.
In Crowded Cell
“ ‘Upon my arrival at the jail my
request to call up my aged mother
and some of my colleagues was de
nied and we were kept in a crowded
cell for 15 hours, every moment of
which I suffered the most indescrib
able mental agony throughout the
Jong night. Though half dazed at
the enormity of the situation, I was
sustained by a consciousness of my
complete innocence.’ ”
St. Cloud today was almost unani
mous for Representative Knutson.
“We will not desert him,” citizens
and officials said, “on the strength
of what little news and details have
come from Washington.
“And from what we know of him
here before he went to Washington,
we refuse to believe such a charge
against him.”
Nothing official has been done lyi
St. Cloud in the way of resolutions or
expressions for or against Mr. Knut
son.

SCHOOL BANK HAS

Woman Is Named Manager of
flouring House at Sioux
City, lowa
SIOUX CITY, I A., March 17.-A
valuable lesson in juvenile thrift is
to be found in the $50,000 placed on
deposit in local banks in the names
of school pupils of this city through
the operation of the Sioux City
Schools Savings hank. Mrs. Ethel
Brestrom manager of this school
bank recently was appointed mana
ger of the Sioux City Clearing House
association. She is said to be the
only woman in the United States act
ing in this capacity.
School teachers are provided with
deposit slips for the school savings
hanks Pupils fill in the blanks for
their deposits of pennies and nickels,
designating the bank with which the
money is to be deposited. The de
posits are turned over by the teacher
to the principal of the school, and
once a week a messenger from the
schools bank makes collections. Mrs.
Brostrom and her corps of assistants
sort the deposits and send them to
the banks for which they were in
tended. This organization has been
operating two years.
In regard to the clearing house ac
tivity, Mrs. Brostrom says: #
I like the work, am in love
with it. The necessity for being
accurate, alert, for checking up
possible errors, and the need for
greatest care at all times ap
peals to me. ,Of course. I had
some years of experience in vari
ous capacities on the manage
ment of the schools’ bank. The
management of the clearing
house seemed to follow natural
ly. so I feel perfectly at home.
Mrs. Brostrom has been a resident
of lowa eight years, and of Sioux
City for six years. She served in
various capacities in the American
Savings bank of Sioux City during
the war, acting as teller, paying and
receiving, and for some time as as
sistant cashier. For a time, until
she was placed in charge of the
schools’ bank, she was employed in
confidential capacities by other banks
of the city.
Enemies Leave Funeral
When Klansmen Appear
EDGERTON, KAN.. March 18.- The
Klan opposition expressed much con
sternation here recently, when Klux
ers of this vicinity entered a local
church to pay their last tribute to
their deceused brother, Klansman
Nathanial H. Wollard, at a funeral
conducted by ministers of three de
nominations, assisted by Edgerton
Klan No. 83 and Palestine lodge No.
172. A. F. and A. M. When the
Knights entered the edifice a num
ber of Catholics and their sympathiz
ers rushed out of the building. Thir
ty-four Klansmen present were at
tired in full regalia. It was one of
the first times the Klansmen had ap
peared in public in uniform.
Among the most useful members
in our organization are those who
are doing business for the Klan in
life’s ordinary and unnoticed daily
tasks.
