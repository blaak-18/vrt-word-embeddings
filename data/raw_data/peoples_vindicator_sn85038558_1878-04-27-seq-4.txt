OUR WASHINGTONV LETTER. .
WASHINGTON D. C., April 23, 1878.
Hon. Montgomery Blair has his tirst ev
rebuff from his own State of Mary laud. Ge
Senator Dennis, in presenting resolu- in
tion of the Maryland Legislature look
ing to a trial of the title of Mir Hayes
to the Presidency said lhe was op- bli
posed to any action by the Senate on
the subject. He made a very patiio- It
tie, if not very conclusive speechl tei
against any agitation of the subject.
The bones of Nortern and Sonthern IHr
men, he said, lay side by side, we
had railroads and telegraph lines all w1
over the country, and the interests of 1k
one section were the interests of all.
And let us have peace. Thlis is all
exceflent, but it has no rteferenuce to be
this particular case. The question is se
whether or not we shall have a judi- of
cial inquiry into the title of a man to i
office. It is not a sectional question, pi
and should not be a disturbing one.
Mr. Blair, as was evident from the
first, has not selected the manner most G
likely to be accepted of opening the at
question in Congress, and neitlher lie St
nor those he has drawn around him iti
are men likely to awaken muclh po- w
polar enthusiasm ; but the idea lie lit
represents is one that is worthy the
most earnest study of all, and should
not be dismissed simply on sentimer- hi
tal grounds.
The House yesterday passed the "
annual Pension Appropriation lill. fr
As originally reported from Commit- of
tee the bill abolished the existing s"
eighteen agencies for payment of pen
sions, and provided for payment di -
rectly from the U. S. Treasury. This I
would have imposed a tax of a quar- e
ter of a million a year on the pestoiin- I
ere, and, most certainly. would have
saved nothing to the government. But a
it was not the merit or lack of merit in a
the proposition that killed it. Secre- 1
tary Schurz, it was found, favored it,
and te conviction became general at
one in the House that there nmist be
something impracticable in thie sclheme
and so it was. killed. Those even i
who hold Mr. Schurz to be the imost
honest of men, and who admnire the I
theories of reform and perfection n
which fill his brain as ordinary every n
day ideas fill the brains of other men,
still hesitate to follow him when his
theories are to be put in practice. The
Pension bill appropriates twenty
nine and ene-quarter millions. An o
amendment to the bill provides that v
after July next wounded or disabled t
Federal soldiers shall be appointed to c
the Agencies. This was a suggestion t
of Mr. Rice, Democratic Chairman of ,
the Pension Committee. The Repub
lican Sonate will doubtless strike out t
this provision.
Gen. James Shields who acquired a
fame as wide as the country in the
Mexican war, and served gallantly in t
the late civil war, had an ovation at
the Capitol yesterty. Something of i
this was due, perhaps, to the late
trick of the Republicans in attempt- i
ing to nse the General's reputation to t
advance their partizan interests, but I
there has never been a time when the
teneral was not a favorite in the
Senate in which hlie has represented
two States, and among the people of
this District. While its doubtful if
the bill placing him on the retired
list of the Army can pass in its pree
ent shape, there is no doubt that this
Congress will provide for a handsome I
recognition of great services of which
all are proud.
8peaking of the General, I am re
minded that on the 30th proximo
there will ie a vote of the Senate on 1
4ireoting the proper Committee to
report a bill giving $8 per month to
all survivors of the Mexican war, and
to the widows of such as have died.
It i. believed the biI will pass.

Sad Accident.
[Claiborne Guardian. I
We learn with sorrow that our friend
W. J. Smith was the victim of an unfor
taiate accident on Saturday last. In
attempting to mount a wild mnule his
foot cangt in thp stirrup and he was
drargedfr some distance. His leg is
broken above the ankle and the ankle is
badly fractured. Dre. Arbuckle and
Gladney are attending Mr. Smith, and we
understand they hope to save the limb.
He Can't Be.
[Baton Rouge Advocate.]
The supreme court in its decision refu
sing a rehearing in the case of Tom An
derson, calls him a malefactor. People
are now carionsly inquiring how the en
preme judges could consistently pro
nounce a man innocent anl in the same
breath call him a malefactor. There can
be but one of the two things either in
law, reason and common sense. He is
either innocent t he is a malefactor.
He can't be both even if the supreme
court did sayso.
Give all a Hearing.
[Rural Times.
Has the Democratic Legislature accom
plished any reformatory measures ? What
good has come'of the victory ? The gen
eral verdict of our citizenship is unfavor
able. Our legislators have been arraign
ed before a merciless public and adjudged
gauilt of thereat ein of omission. Sen
ator White, of Orleans, undertakes a re

fully read, that all parties mnay have a
None but lomaus are Wanted.
[Jeferson Sentinel.]
The dissatisfaction of the people at the
failure of the Legislature to call a consti
totional convention is beginning to mani
fest iBelf in a very decided manner,
throughout the country parishes. Al
ready steps are being taken to organize a
movement having for its object the de
feat of all the constitutional amendments
adopted by the last Legislature. At the
same time pledges favorng the calling of
a onastitutional convention are to be ex
aeted from candidates at the next elec
tion, for the Legislature, and none others
except conventiojiites will stand any
show of success in the next camopaign.
Tba Nevada Reveille thus describe.
a bar-room or street corner journal
1st:
He stands in the saloons with his
back to the stove and tells how be
coutd ran a newspaper; how le would
be Independent as a hog on ice, and
call things by their right names; how
he would exause corruption in high
plaees; how he would write good,
snoad common sense, and none of
your frivolous try-to-he-funny stuff.
Then he criticises other people's meth
ods of conducting newspapers, and
just wishes somebody would give him
a chance to show his journalistic abil
Ity." The way to cure one of those
chaps is to get him to agree to writes
sensible article every day for a week.
Before the week us out he is.sure to
be pumped dry, and will gape worse
for an idea than a chicken does with
the plp.

Harrison IBros., of Philadelphia, C<
say : "That of fourteen imaterials
required by the vegetable world, it -
is sufficiently well settled that nitro
gen, phosphoric acid, potash, sulphu
ric acid, lime and magnesia are the
'only ingredients of plant-faod which
needl be supplied in fertilizers ; every
ordinary smo l has the othlier materials
Swhich plants 4equire.
.1. Colloigne, 4 noted horticulturist I
i of Brunges, has been very successful I
t with potatoes by planting whole tu- '
I bers thirty inches apart in the row, e
D or cut in half at twenty inches of dis- f
Stantce. The sets are placed on the f
f surface, and a slight covering of soil
- drawn over them. It is claimed for
t this plan that the seed sprouts very
q(uickl3, and their development is
a also hastened, which is a point gain- "
e ed in avoiding the destructive pota
n to disease. The earth is gradually
it drawn upl around the plants as they -
if increase in size and as the require
c ments of the crop appear to suggest.
It is further claimed in favor of this
0 treatment, air and heat have an (opi
it portunity of gaining a freer access to
c the roots than by any other, and nac- ]
e cording to our foreign authority this a
d method deserves to be fully tested,
)f not only on account of thie accelera
if tion of growtli, but because of an
d alleged increase of yield.
is A simple method of destroying the
pe phylloxera has just been published
i in pamphlet form, by Madame Amle
na de Bompar, of the Canton of Ples- I
sac. According to her experience,
o all that is needed to insue this happy
n result is to set strawberries at the
:o foot of Ihe vine stocks. These plants,
m in her neigihborhood at any rate, are I
d infested by a spider of the genus
d. Trombidion, whose business and
pleasure it is to devour both the
phylloxera and its eggs with such a
ravenous appetite that the reproduc -
tion of the pest in its vicinity is
scarcely posside.
Seeds are more easily killed by I]
high temperature than low. Though j
I no seeds have been known to geroni
or- nate below 370 Farenheit, they are,
witn few exceptions, destroyed by a
witehprtre nabove 1680, and bnyy
in kinds perish below that point. They I
is will not germinate above 1280. Most
td seeds will stand the severest cold of 4
ye the winters in this latitude, and wheat
left for years in the Arctic region has
been sown in England afterwards,
where it germinated freely.
ti- Experience shows that the farmer
n- who raises his wheat, his corn, his
le mules and his pork at home succeeds
u- better than the one who raises only
one article. This argument for a
,ni mixed husbandry is equally strong
in far a mixed industry, and the country
is that nmanufactures every article that
- its soil and resources adapt it for, is
11 richer, more prosperous and more
powerful than the one which con
findes its industry to the mannfac·
turing of but one article of any kind.
