The Poor Journalist. c4
ul Of all the professions in the world di
in there is not one in which the mistakes al
n- made are brought so prominently ve
ch before the public as that of Journal- cc
or ism. A merchant may make mis- w,
of takes in his figures, in his prices or m
n weight or measures, but it does not tit
on appear where every person in the th
e- city and vicinity can see it. It is re
not proclaimed to thousands of eyes in
e in the evening nor published where all
t. all can know it in the morning. If
,r a doctor gives a wrong prescription,
th it isn't known to everybody, but in inl
r journalism an error of similar import in
is seen and noted by thousands. A
word mispelled, a letter of the wrong th4
font, an ungrammatical sentence or sal
misstatement of facts, overlooked in ou
the- hurry and bustle of rapid and suj
rushing work, is pounced upon by ma
critics and the journalist informed stu
d that such mistakes are inexcusable. bo

A Fatal Accident
The following is a special from cal
SI-ouma to the New Orleans Picayune Th
of Feb. so. Felix Bonvillain, who wh
had such a narrow escape from a rec
most horrible death, is the brother Jot
of Mrs. J. L. Duhart of this town,
e and is well known in Lafayette.
e "To-day at 3 o'clock p. m., on the
Laurel Farm plantation of Mrs. C.
BEonvillian, situated on bayou Black, hut
6 miles from town, the boiler of the Th
e draining machine erploded, killing t88
three boys and wounding four others, put
one of which the doctors declare a
will die, thus making the total cas- Fre
ualties four. At the time of the ex- rem
plosion Mr. Felix Bonvillian, man- one
ager on said plantation, was stand- ter
ing over the boiler with St. Clair
Quick and a colored man named
Johnson Clement, who had charge
of the machine. None of t1e men
were hurt, though badly shocked 4
from the noise of the explosion.
The three boys that were killed and
the four that were wounded were
fishing at the time on the banks of
a levee, just in the rear of the
draining machine. All three boys
are colored. The names of the
killed are: John Clement, Jr., aged
x4 years; Wiltz Rollins, aged za
years, and George McKinner, Jr.,
aged to. Young Clement had the
top part of his head and his brains
completely blown away. A brother
of'George McKinner,,Jr., was badly
wounded, and the doctors declare he
canhOt live. John Matthews, a col- ets
ored nan on the place, had two boys
:bidly.scalded; Joe Martin, aged ai
-years, was badly scalled.
