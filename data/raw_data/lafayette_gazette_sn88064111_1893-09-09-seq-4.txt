and deplorable indeed is the condition
of the person who has not paid it a

seen the fair, but if he departs without
having turned his steps westward
through that wonderful avenue of mys
teries and dropped in on the queer peo
ple of all lands, he will find himself
sadly deficient in information when
his friends in his distant home inquire i
about the sights of the Plaisance of
which they have read so much.
While embraced in the general plan
of the fair and considered part and 1
parcel thereof, the enterprises of the
Plaisance are private, and partake 1
somewhat of the nature of side-shows.
Each one has a fixed price of admission,
which of itself is but a mere trifle, but
when once within the gates the cost of 4
entering is apt to be largely increased
if a check is not placed upon one's ap
petite for viands and drinks of all
kinds, and if this desire to possess the
curious and beautiful souvenirs on sale
is not promptly curbed.
The first thing that strikes the eye on
the left on entering the Plaisance from
the fair ground is the picturesque Blar
Ir THE IRISH VILLAGE.
ney castleand its surrounding cottages,
which compose the interesting Irish in
dustrial exhibit, presided over by Lady
Aberdeen. This is the only enterprise
in the Midway Plaisance not operated
and promoted for private gain. The
profits accruing from this exhibit go
into a fund created for the purpose of
making the people of Ireland self-sus
taining and for removing the taint of
poverty from the Emerald isle. It is a
worthy enterprise, and presents some
very interesting and entertaining fea
tures, among them being the celebrated
Blarney ston, which is set in an ex
act reprodaction of the historic castle.
The entrance to the village is a gem
of early Celtic architecture, bearing over
the portal the words: "Cead Mile
Failte," which, translated, bids the vis
itor a hundred thousand welcomes.
Once within the mimic city, the
stranger finds much to instruct and
amuse. Here the process of dairying,
lace-making and other Irish industries
are faithfully represented, and the time
may be pleasantly passed in listening
to genuine Irish songs, dances, etc.
The funds to sustain this enterprise
were subscribed by people of every po
ltical asd religious faith in Ireland

eeantry. There is another Irish vllage
in the Plaisance, on the righthand side
further west, which offers many fea
tures of interest, but the one that has
the Blarney stone must, and very natu
rally. attract the most attention.
A little further along the Plaisance,
on the right-haid side going west, there
Js the Javanese village, of which so
much has been said and written. Vith
out going into a detailed account of its
many queer features, we can but may
that it is we ! worth the price asked to
pass thro uthis strange community.
The peopl mselves are the greatest
curiosities othis remarkable exhibit.
Their ho~ses. mode of living and many
curios from the land of the Malay offer
ample interest for an hour's visit, but
when the visitor leaves their gates he
does so with - impression that there
is a race that cannot well lay claim to
being anything like clean in their
habits.
A little further along are the Ger
man villages, "Old Vienna" on the left
and the German village proper on the
right, in either of which there is much
tobe seen and heard that will afford the
visitor a profitable hour's pause. Aside
from the beer and music, which are in
dispensable adjuncts to most all Ger
man entertaiments, there is much to
please and instruct in the various pro
ductions of art and industrial skill.
The concerts in themselves are always
a great attraction for lovers of martial
music,and great crowds of Germans are
constantly drawn to the daily concerts
in these villages.
In the immediate neighborhood of
the German villages are the Turkish
mosques and bazars in which are
faithfully portrayed the different
phases of life in the oriental cities.
Regularly every day, at stated inter
vals of about two hours, may be heard
the plaintive wail of the muezzin who
from his lofty perch on the mosque
calls his brethren to prayer.
Not a word of the invocation is dis
tinguishable; the chant is simply a
long, somewhat melodious and plain
tively quavering intonation. It would
not become a professional muezzin to
chant otherwise. He continues on this
strain for several minutes - long
enough for a wonderfully cosmopolitan
crowd to collect; and as usual it is an
Irishman who volunteers the first criti
cism of the performance.
*"Begorra, me fadder on the ould sod
once had a baste of a donkey wid a vice
intoirely loike thot chap!"
Meantime the Moslems have heard,
and here and there in the alleys of the
village red fezes may be seen, bowing
to the ground. To be in good and proper
form, a Moslem should kneel and bow to
the southeast-in the direction of Mec
ca. But the poor fellows appear to be
a good deal "turned around" in Chica
go, and are bowing to all points of the
compass.
Further along are the villages of the
Indians and Dahomeyans, the latter be
ing among the most attractive features
in the Plaisance. This village recalls,
to use the words of John C. Eastman,
in an article in the Chautauquan, the
stories of Stanley, Livingstone, and
Paul du Chaillu. It is inclosed by
a fence made of bark with a platform

running along the top and the entire
distance of the Midway front. There
are also signal towers near the entrance
and into these thatched boxes black
and savage sentinels are to be seen
every day dancing madly when they
are not singing and shaking long loops
of goats' hoofs. There is no doubt that
the Dahomeyans are more closely allied
with the cruel and superstitious prac
tices of savagery than any other coun
try represented in Midway. The wom
en are as fierce if not fiercer than the
men and all of them have to be watched
day and night for fear they may use
their spears for other purposes than a
barbaric embellishment of their dances
These make up a great part of the
list of attractions of Midway Plaisance,
without which the world's fair would
be incomplete, inasmuch as they afford
the people of the western world an op
portunity of studying the lives and
habits of those far-off races with which
they have been acquainted through re
port only.

Prof. Bodney Welch,of New Yorkecity,
is writing some interesting descriptions
of the various exhibits in the Agricul
tural building at the Columbian expo
sition for a New York paper. In a re
cent tour of that enormous bnilding
the professor investigated the exhibits
of honey and beeswax, -which are to be
found at the east end of the Agricul
tural building. He discovered that in
the Greelan agricultural exhibit Stam
atios Papagannakis, of Athens, shows
nearly fifty varieties of honey, some of
which were-collected by bees from
flowers that grew upon MountOlympus.
There is nothing in the appearance of
this honey that would seem to warrant
the praise bestowed upon it by Homer
and other Grecian poets It must be re
membered, however, says Prof. Welch,
that Homer was blind and therefore
could not notice that its color was ex
ceedingly dark. No modern poet with
good sight would pronounce it "food
fit for the gods," though it must be
acknowledged that the flavor of sont*
of this Grecian honey was delicious.
Each of the states, except New York,
making exhibits-Colorado, California,
Ohio, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Iowa, Min
nesota, Michigan and Indiana-confine
their displays to a single case. Nebras
ka makes an interesting showing of
the chief honey-producing plants of the
state. Four-cases are filled with honey
and beeswax from New York. The bee
keepers of the state also have a large
case in which five colonies of bees may
be seen at work. Through apertures
in the walls of the building the in
dustrious insects go "far out upon the
prairies," collect the harvest of the
flowers and return with their sweet
stores. In the display of New York is
a large quantity of apparatus employed
in handling bees and extracting honey
from the comb. Many styles of bee
hives are also shown, including some of
the straw "skeps" which were in use
two centuries ago. An attempt is made
by those in charge of the New York
display to show visitors the honey pro
duced by different flowers.
Next to New York Ontario, Canada,
makes the largest display of honey, and
is in many respects the most satisfacto
ry to dealers. It is chiefly 'in large
packages, weighing from fifty to sev
enty-five pounds. Most of these pack
ages contain the honey extracted from
a single kind of flower. The large
blocks of candied honey attract con
siderable attention, as the Canadians
are endeavoring to find a market for
theirs in this condition. The comb
honey in this display is by far the finest
on exhibition, as all the cells are per
fectly sealed.
At one end of the gallery devoted to
displays of honey and beeswax is a
large collection of hives, honey ex
tractors, bee smokers, face protectors,
honey knives, comb fundations and
many other appliances used in handling
bees and honey. There is also a large
collection of literature pertaining to
bees and honey.
Beekeepers desire to sell extracted
honey and consumers desire it in the
comb. Comb honey is difficult to trans
port, and on that account is expensive.
As an article of commerce honey no
longer deserves much attention. Ithas
a sentimental rather than an intrinsic
value. All the poets from David to
Whittier have sung its praises. But re
cently other sweets have been pro
duced that take its place, and it now
comes in competition with many con
diments unknown to the people of for
mer times. Cheap and rapid transpor
tation make it practical to have fresh
fruits nearly all the year, while canned
fruits of every kind are so cheap that
the poorest can consume them freely.
Candles made from an .adulterated
beeswax are required for Catholic
churches, and an exhibit of them is
made by several countries. Some of
the altar candles are eight feet in
length and are most beautifully orna
mented with representations of Christ,
the holy virgin and the apostles. Can
dles superior to these in design and
finish cannot be seen in any of the great
cathedrals of Europe.
"MIDWAY PLAISANCE."
The Correct Pronunciation of This Title
as Adopted by General Usage.
Since the opening of the fair it has
been a matter to observe with regret
that the name of that strange thorough
fare wherein many nations are repre.
sented has been regularly and auda
ciously mispronounced by a large pro*
portion of the general public.
It has been charged that in selecting
the title, "Midway Plaisance," the park
commissioners made an unwarranted
incursion upon a foreign tongue, but
when one considers the inadequacy of
the word "street," the effeminacy of
"avenue," and the total impossibility
of "boulevard," it is not hard to see
what led them to the choice. The real
ly woeful consequence of their selec
tion is to be found in the weirdly varied
pronunciation which some people give
it. "Plezzunts" is common, so is "play
zance." "Playzahants," with the accent
on the ultimate, is a favorite. Fre
quently a speaker, doubtful of his ac
curacy, makes a sweeping contraction
ano elision of the word, with the evi
dent hope of escaping observation, and
says: "Midway 'lez'ns'."
The more popular .lexicographers of
fer little help, and it remains with the
speaker to choose whether he shall
consider the word as Er -lish-it is an
obsolete form of the arc-haic English
word "pleasaunce"---or as modern
French. The spellingof the older Eng
lish and the present Gallic form is iden
tical. If it is old English it is "play
zance," with the accent weightiest on
the first syllable. If it is French it is
"playzongs" (as nearly as may be indi
cated in English letters) with no ac
cent at all, or with very little accent on
the final syllable.
Judging from the general usage here,
it would seem that the latter pronun
ciation is the one destined to rule.

AMOse the mauy things exhibited at

fired the first shot from Fort Sumter
and opened the late civil war is also on
exhibition in the Government building.
It is a four-pounder and well pre
