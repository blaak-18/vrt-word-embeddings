Veteran’s Corner
BRO. TODD, LIKE A SOLDIER,
HARD TO WHIP.
Hon. Tom Watson:—l am “touch
ous” when it corhes to assailing any
Confederate soldier. You say you
will never assail or offend one, then
was not “Old Jube” as much a Con
federate soldier as his men were?
Now as to generalship—
Problem:
Given: Phil Sheridan and 18,000 to
20,000 men pitted in. the Valley of
Virginia against J. A. Early, with
70,000, even with Early’s men com
posed of “Dutch,” niggers, and a few
“blue-bellies,” which would have
proved the greater general? Early
captured as many of Sheridan’s can
non at Cedar Creek as Sheridan ever
took of his. Gen. Gordon told the
writer in person the story of Cedar
Creek. It is true Gen. Early refused
to restrain or stop his men from
feasting on the good things they had
captured, including whiskey, cham
paign, etc., and Gen. Gordon begged
him to do so, and to press the pur
suit, but that only showed Early’s
confidence in his army and fearless
ness of the army of Sheridan. The
latter brought up by forced march
enough fresh troops to beat back
Gordon’s and Early’s disorganized
forces and recover their looted
camps—that’s all.
If you will read Gen. Wade Hamp
ton’s Preface to Percy Gregg’s his
tory, and the efforts the North made
to have the edition, suppressed and
destroyed, you will not couple it
with “Northern” writers any more.
You are a writer of history, and
all I want is that you don’t compare
any Confederate general or soldier to
W. J. Bryan—you ought to “take it
back.”
As an old soldier of Hood’s Texas
brigade in Virginia, I might abuse
Joe Johnson, but I won’t. I love
them both. I love even Pemberton,
who gave up Vicksburg not to Grant,
but to Gen. Starvation.
GEO. T. TODD.
Jefferson, Tex., August 14, 1909.
P. S.—The knife came, and it’s a
good one. I prize it highly and your
picture on it. My friends all want to
borrow it—but it’s not “for loan.”
TODD.
A TRIBUTE TO JACKSON.
To The Weekly Jeffersonian:
With your permission, all esti
mates of Southern values in the late
war should include and center around
the one great genius, the “Stone
wall” of the Southern Confederacy
—one who stood pre-eminently forth
as the annointed leader of far-flung
battle lines. And deny it who may,
in his loss Death’s imprimatur set
the stern finis to the fluttering hopes
of his well-beloved Southland.
Yon eulogize, and rightly, the
Southern private; his fig’ ting morale
has never been equalled. He set the
pace in every battle of the war.
But whose was the hand that shap
ed the plastic clay to soldierly per
fectibility? Whose the leadership
that inspired him to deathless hero
ism? Jackson’s.
His mintage of victory stands, a
Csb<t "Jeffersonian
sculptured relief, in an historical
niche before which Time will for
ever burn the living incense of love
and admiration; the one for the
Christian soldier and his dauntless
brigades; the other for the astute
Commander whose pen glossed no
single line of defeat.
Who dreams of that lonely Vir
ginia valley but there comes to him,
in cameo, Jackson’s face and form,
topped with his old slouch cap?
Early and Sheridan may well be
forgotten as indeterminate adver
saries on the chess-board; but Jack
son—. His fame lives in the rocks
and dirt crunched beneath his charg
er’s feet and the quick-step tread of
the regiments than whom history
paints no greater example of humble
abnegation for that intangible breath
—Patriotism. Starvation or exhaus
tion, it was all one to them. When
Jackson’s commands rang out the
advance, sore feet and empty stom
achs were things to joke about.
The fragrance of his life and
genius must surely still haunt the
valley immortalized by his deeds;
the rippling waters must surely
whisper, to the mind attuned, of his
glorious life and death.
Respectfully,
A KENTUCKIAN.
Brookline, Mass., August 10, 1909.
In the weekly Jeffersonian of Au
gust sth you say the West Point tra
dition put an inferior man over Gor
don. Correct. And you say that if
Gen. Lee could have freed himself
from that fetter and given the valley
campaign into the care of Gordon its
results would have been very differ
ent. This all important matter did
not rest with Gen. Lee. Agt. Gen.
Cooper made the detachment and
designated the commander.
Gen. Lee was indelibly impressed
with Gordon’s military ability in the
Wilderness battle on the sth of May.
The 12 th of May overwhelmingly
convinced Gen. Lee that Gen. Gor
don was eminently qualified for any
position in the Confederate service.
After it was too late the Confederate
Congress made Gen. Lee Commander
in-Chief of the Confederate forces.
He at once removed Gen. Early and
gave Gen. Gordon his command.
Yours truly,
E. N. KNG.

“It goes to the brain naturally, and
to every part of the body, every organ
being fed on this polluted blood, or
sewerage. It goes to your face in the
form of pimple-poison and nreaks out
on the skin. It goes to your head and
gives you headache and dizziness, it
goes to your brain and makes you
drowsy, it weakens the stomach and
causes dyspepsia, and bad breath, it
goes to the liver and causes bilious
ness, it goes to the kidneys and even
tually gives rise to Bright’s Disease,
it goes to the heart and makes it
thump, it goes to the eyes and they
lose their lustre, it makes your nerves
flabby and weak and out-of-sorts, and
this is the advance agent of all kinds
of disease, which you couldn’t get at all
