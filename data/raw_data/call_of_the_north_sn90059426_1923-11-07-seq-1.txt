STIRS GRAND FORKS

Friends And Critics Alike Pack The
Church of Rev. F. Halsey Ambrose
to Hear What He is Going
to Say Next.
-K-K
Grand Forks, N. D.—King KlEagle
of the Ku Klux Klan in North Dakota
and Exalted Cylops of the Grand
Forks Klan, Rev. F. Halsey Ambrose,
pastor of the First Presbyterian
church of this city, boasts that his
church has the largest attendance of
any in the central West.
And ij perhaps is the only church
in this part of the country that con
ducts services to “standing room
only” every Sunday, and where the
overflowing crowd is made up of both
friends and critics of the spectacular
pastor, who not only openly proclaims
his high standing in the ranks of the
“Invisible Empire,” but who almost
outdoes Billy Sunday in his some
what out-of-the-ordinary pulpit meth
ods.
Fully three-quarters of an hour be
fore the service has begun the church
is filled. A half hour before the main
auditorium is filled the Sunday school
room and galleries are opened. Fif
teen minutes before ushers are plac
ing chairs in the aisle. Ten minutes
before people are standing in the rear
of the church and remain not for an
hour but for two hours (in the even
ing.) >
All Sects Represented
The crowd at the church is not only
Presbyterian but Methodist, Episco
palian, Lutheran, Jewish, Catholic,
Adventist and non-sectarian. Mr.
Ambrose makes a boast that “This
church has the largest attendance of
any in the central West and has had
it for five years”—the period of his
ministry. “Yes, that’s right. I know
it. I always know what I am talk
ing about. That is why no one
checks up on me.”
“We have more men come to our
church than to all the other churches
in the city put together,” he contin
ued. “I know one church in this city
where there are six ushers. Last
Sunday night five of the six ushers
were here. I’d like to know who took
up the collection there.”
Dr. Ambrose, in conducting his
service, cares not a whit what he says
nor how he says it.
His Entrance Is Dramatic
Without question, Dr. Ambrose be
lieves in dramatic effects. Does he
enter the pulpit while the robed choir
takes its place in the loft? No, in
deed. The choir has long since set
tled itself and the organist is part
way through a march which an
nounces as plainly as the lines of a
play that the star is about to make
his entrance. The audience turns ex
pectantly towards a closed door. It
swings wide open. The organ peals
triumphantly. Rev. F. Halsey Am
brose, pastor of the First Presbyte
rian church of Grand Forks, King
KlEagle of the Realm of North Da
kota, Ku Klux Klan, and Exalted
Cyclops of the .Grand Forts Klan,
steps confidently down the platform.
The audience restrains applause.
While the congregation sings a
hymn Dr. Ambrose arranges a great
sheaf of papers, many of them affida
vits designed to support some of his
startling statements. Then he reads
a scripture lesson in such a manner
that every word is listened to with
interest. Another hymn and he is
ready for the announcements. A
male stenographer comes briskly
down the aisle and takes his place at
a table. Dr. Ambrose prepares him
self against any “comeback,” he says.
Here are a few remarks from the
pulpit:
“There will be a Salvation Army
drive here this week. Don’t get off
as' cheap as you can—Grand Forks
style. I’ve been in Grand Forks
enough to know. There is a
staring of sparrows from one end of
this town to the oth& singing,
'Cheap, Cheap, Cheap.’”
“The minister of a church can be
pope of the institution if he knows
how. If he don’t he cant, that’s all.”
. “Church membership is not an in
surance policy against the fires. of
ML The Lord doesn’t judge a man
THE VOICE OF MILITANT PROTESfANTISM OF THE NORTHWEST
THE CALL ¥ NORTH
by the size of his head or by the cut
of his coat.”
“If you're going to come into the
church you hafd better get in while
the getting is good. Mavbe I won’t
take you. Oh, yes, I comd keep you
out.”
By this ...very forceful meth
od the clergyman has added 600 mem
bers to the chureh roll since he went
there five years ago.
How He Keeps Them There
When Dr. Ambrose gets ready to
deliver his sermon he is as apt to
say as not, “Tonight I’m not in a
very good humor. I'm -tired. I
be bothered with anyone leaving
Anyone who doesn’t want to be here
until 9:30 leave now. Otherwise he
is likely to get a hymn book thrown
at his head.”
None has ever been known to leave.
“The Lord is my shepherd. I
should worry,” is his version of the
23d psalm.
Dr. Ambrose has been in Grand
Forks for five years and he says he
is going to remain here until the
place is “cleaned up.” However, he
is well satisfied with the present con
dition of things.
“We are pretty clean now,” he
says, “I doubt if anyone can get a
quart of liquor in this town.”
He denies that„ the Ku Klux Klan
has taken any part in the cleanup ac
tivities although he uses the term
“we” considerably. The Klan
strength in North Dakota is 26,000,
he says.
He is a great admirer of the late
Theodore Roosevelt and quotes him
constantly.
“Teddy would have made a good
Klansman,” says Dr. Ambrose.

Cambridge, Mass. Harvard uni

action against the Ku Klux Klan at

This fact was made plain by the

Cambridge, Mass. The "continued

the precincts of the Harvard univer

ject of an article this week in “The
Harvard Crimson,” undergraduate
paper.
For two years the Klan has been
flourishing on the campus, according
to “The Crimson,” and is steadily
growing more powerful, waiting only
for a favorable moment to show its
full strength. This moment is.-rap
idly approaching, in the opinion of
the school paper.

CHURCH WINDOWS ARE
B||ASHED BY HOODLUMS
George Bounds of
the King wood Methodist church at
Wilmington, Del., preached a sermon
advocating law observance and the
upholding of American ideals and
principles hoodlums and foreigners
hurled bricks through his church win
dows recently, doing much damage.
Wilmington Klan No. 7, Realm of
Delaware, presented Dr. Bounds with
a check for SIOO to cover the dam
age. On the evening of this action
the Klan initiated 55 aliens into citi
zenship in the Invisible Empire.
Resolutions
WHEREAS, it has come to the attention of this, the New Ulm Provisional Klan
No. 29, Realm of Minnesota, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, that certain sectarian
organizations are disseminating a species of sectarian propaganda which unfairly
and unjustly seeks to convert public opinion towards establishing a figure in world
history, known and named as Christopher Columbus, as discoverer of America, and
WHEREAS, the Roman Catholic hierarchy claims the sole right and divine
jurisdiction over the Western Hemisphere, because of this alleged discovery, as is
proven in the Encyclical Letter of Pope Leo XIII, given at St. Peter’s, Rome, on the
25th day of December, 1891, in the 15th year of pontificate, wherein is stated, that
“The American Republic under Protestant rulers is with the worst enemies of the
Church; thUTßepublic having seized upon the lands discovered by Christopher Colum
bus,. a Catholic, and usurped the authority and jurisdiction of the supreme head of
the church,” and
WHEREAS, all historians maintain doubt as to Columbus having ever set foot
on North America, many claiming that he died entirely ignorant of the existence of
the mainland; that Columbus was in a sense a discoverer possibly, in so far that he
reached a West Indian island, which was named San Salvador in the year 1492, but
that this alleged discovery was purely accidental, as he had originally set out to sail
for India, where gold and riches were the lure, while some historians on the other
hand claim that he had prior knowledge of the existence of a new world from the
archieves of the Vatican, where information and learning of every sqyt were care
fully filed, recording the Norse discovery of Vineland and of the voyages of the
Vikings to our shores; that this previous knowledge which Columbus had at his dis
posal gave him that extraordinary confidence, which the romantic accounts of his
voyage to San Salvador are ascribed ta| his “enlightenment from heaven,” and
WHEREAS, fair and unbiased history records that to Leif Ericson is due the
honor of discovery of the American continent in the year 1900, five centuries previous
to the alleged discovery of America by Columbus, that Ericson in his explorations
touched three peninsulas—Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Cape Cod, building his
house and passing the winter near the latter on the mainland, which he called Vine
land (now Massachusetts), that he made known his discovery, and described the char
acter of the new land, upon his return to Greenland the following year, and
WHEREAS, and further, if any man is to be honored by the American people
as discoverer of America ,the honor should go to Leif Ericson, end to him only, and
so therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED, that we go on record as deploring the insidious propaganda
beging promoted in our schools and through the public press, by exalting and extolling
Christopher Columbus as the discoverer of America, and we further deplore and resent
the action of any local sectarian organizations proclaiming through paid advertise
ments in the press that October 12th, designated by such organizations as Columbus
Day, such day to be commemorated because of this alleged “discovery of our great
land,” and we further resent the false claim that the Western Hemisphere is under
the sole and divine jurisdiction of the papacy due to the alleged discovery of America
by a Catholic, calling attention to the fact that Leif Ericson, of Nordic stock, from
which the Anglo-Saxon race was developed, was the real discoverer of America—par
ticularly the United States—that our country was colonized by Protestant Pilgrims,
that it was given birth as a Christian -nation, by a Protestant Washington, and its
unity was preserved by a Protestant Lincoln, and further be it N
RESOLVED, that a copy of these resolutions be spread upon the minutes of
this organization, and that copies be forwarded to all Protestant ministers in New
Ulm; to all fraternal organizations in New Ulm; te all state legislators of Minn
esota; to the entire press of the state; and to, all Klan and other patriotic publica
tions throughout the nation. ■ '

Baltimore, Md. —Roman controlled

were publicly repudiated by Frank

chief of the inspection division, city
highways department. In a public
statement, Mr. Beall announced that
he was resigning in order to devote
all of his time to the office of Grand
Dragon, Knights of the Ku Klux

elected to this position last Sunday.
Mr. Beall was the first Exalted
Cyclops of the Klan in Maryland, as
chief of Thomas Dixon Klan. He
also was the first Klan Giant in
Maryland. >
According to Mr. |Beall, there now
are 72 Klans in Maryland, with a
membership aggregating 33,000.
Nine other officers also were elected
to state Klan positions at the Ann

Dr. Hawkins, Mr. Beall said, now

SCHWINGHAMMER TO EXPEL
KLAN ELKS
—K-K-K
Atlantic City, N. J. Thinking
more of their duty to God and coun
try and their oath as Klansmen, a
number of members of Elks Lodge
No. 276 of Atlantic City, were ex
pelled from the order last week.
Catholics being in the majority in
the membership of the local Elks
lodge, it was an easy matter for the
Caseys to eject the 100 per cent
Americans.
Official spokesmen for the Knights
of Columbus and the Elks lodge here
stated that the action taken by the
local lodge was the forerunner of a
national campaign against the Klan
by Elks.
The Atlantic City Lodge of Elks,
whose exalted ruler bears the good
old American name of Schwingham
mer, has voted to expel any of their
members who may also be members
of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
Herr Schwinghammer in his further
ance of these principles of brotherly
love states that this movement will
be exploited throughout Elkdom.
From the numbers of Elks who
visited the Imperial Palace during
their national convention in Atlanta,
Ga., last summer and presented their
credentials as Klansmen it looks as
if the Elks might lose a large num
ber of their members should the
hammer schwing. The B. P. 0. E.
is a splendid patriotic order and a
division in their ranks such as ad
vocated by the Atlantic City agitator
would be most deplorable.

Kentuckians are joining the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan by the
thousands just at present. Every
Klan in the Blue Grass state is active
and all report increases in member
ship. Among some of the recent
Kentucky meetings are included the
following:
Lexington Klan, Realm of Ken
tucky, last week naturalized a class
of 800 aliens during an impressive
ceremonial held a few miles out of
Lexington. The Scott county officials
provided a number of deputies and
these prevented a gang of hoodlums
from disturbing the meeting and als
handled traffic.
The first Klan parade in Glencoe,
Ky., was held there last week. The
parade was witnessed by several
thousand persons. Following the dis
banding of the procession, a large
class of aliens was naturalized. At
the close of the ceremony an excel
lent display of fireworks closed the
meeting.
Five hundred aliens were natural
ized by Georgetown Klan, Realm of
Kentucky, at a ceremonial held just
outside the city limits last week.
Membership in the Klan at this time
is showing a steady increase in this
county.

WHAT AVAILETH A
SEA OF WHITEWASH?
Not so many years ago a
grand jury “investigated” com
plaints of small-town merchants
that St. Paul police were har
boring crooks.
It brought forth a nice white
wash of the police.
And the foreman of that
grand jury afterward was elect
ed county assessor.
Now another grand jury is
“investigating” charges of
small-town merchants that
crooks are disposing of their
stuff in St. Paul with impunity.
Meanwhile E. Armitage, mer
chant of Waterville, Minn., com
plains that St. Paul police failed
to heed his requests to capture
auto thieves who stole goods of
him which have now been found
at Wildwood Manors.
No one can foresee the out
come of these grand jury pro
ceedings.
It is a difficult matter to prove
anything with the police trying
to cover up and the city admin
istration inclined to discredit
the charges.
But practically the same in
fluences and to some extent the
same personnel control the po
lice department now that were
in control then.
John J. O’Connor is gone but
F. W. Sommer is at the helm.
George Dawson, O’Connor’s
right-hand man, is license in
spector.
The police theory of cultivat
ing crooks in order to keep track
of them is followed.
Where there are crooks there
is bound to be plunder.
It isn’t good advertising for
St. Paul to be known in the
country as a haven of crooks.—

Dr. Edwin De Barr Defends Legis

FLAYS “SIX-SHOOTER” RULE
Thirty-Third Degree Mason Takes
Stump for Americanism
—K-K-K
Des Moines, lowa.—Dr. Edwin De
Barr, 33* Mason, and for 30 years
vice president of the University of
Oklahoma, began a lecture tour in
De 3 Moines on October 22, planning
to spend several weeks traveling
throuhgout the state lecturing on the
principles of the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan.
All of the lectures are being given
to the public and anyone who cares
to attend has been barred. One of
the subjects covered in the addresses
was the political plot, which was the
basis for the recent Oklahoma
trouble.
Dr. Deßarr has made a special
analysis of the Ku Klux Klan, based
on a keen observation and an under
standing of the dangers confronting
the nation. He is prominent in the
educational and fraternal activities in
the Southern states.
Dr. Deßarr defended the course of
the legislature in seeking the im
peachment of Walton—whose impe
rialistic reign, he said, would have
split the citizens of the state in two
hostile camps and caused considerable
bloodshed —had the governor been
permitted to continue his “six-shoot
er” reign of martial law.
Dr. Deßarr predicted the early
downfall of Waltonianism and the
restoration of law and order, under
civil authorities. He said that Wal
ton made an issue of the Klan as an
excuse for martial law, when the or
ganization was leas active in that
i state than any state in the Union,
