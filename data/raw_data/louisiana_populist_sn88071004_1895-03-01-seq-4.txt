Si you sle, 1ir. Editor, I allt of
the opinion that lmuch, if not all of
this sin against the sutffrage of the
pi'ople lies at the door of conscrv
liative and othertwi:e fair-nindedili
democrats; sin:-e they .ive it their
imoral support, and its remouxval
rests with them.
What secret, sulltN-, evil p.>wer
is this, that holds honest, conrl;v
ative democrats to the uliiid un
quleslioning support of as unscrtul;
utlous a cliss of political pirates ias
ever cursed the world in any age
or nation
Is it that honest democrats h1ive
lost their manhood, their couraie.
their sense of justice and fair play ?4
Now, I would say to thetn (hon
est democrats), awake from your
sleep, and right these wrongs,
pcrpctrt.ted in the name of your
party, against the ballot box, ºc
fore too late. For remembner the
Populists lpatty is not composed of
cowards, but of ntenr who have
twicegiven bitll. for what they
believed to be their right.. When
they shall have exhausted all peace
ful and legitimate means to re
dress these their grievances and a
third call to battle should be sound
ed, they will i found standing
shoulder to shoulder, in defence of
what they conceive to be their
most sacred right-the right to
cast a free ballot, and have it hon
estly counted.
