The extreme importance of saving
the eountrt will hold the politicians
of both sides excused next yeas for a
few "clerical errors;" but the elecs
tions this year are a, few and initm
portant that, really, misrepresenta.
tions-let us call them--ought to IKe
avoided, if only to mike them more
effective in the Presidential canvass.
It is in the interest not so much of
truth, theretfre, as of the effective
nes of nest year's patriotic appeals
that w eall attention to a "clerical
error" which is just now injuring the
republican chances in 1880. Tim
Charleston News and Courier, in the
course of tn article strongly and
righteously condemning an attempt
to prevent a notorious negro named
'wails from living at his home, re
marks that 'things were done in the
canvass of 1876 and 1878 which can
not and must not be done again;"
whereupon some Northern republiean
journals set up a cry that bere is a
confession of wlong doing. Well,
yes; and it would he a good thing if
the republicans should join in the
News and Courier's words. We all
know that in the canvass of 1876
things were done by the republican
party which "cannot and must not
tie done again;" and if the South
Carolina canvass of 1878 were close.
ly examined it would be discovered
that even in that year the republi.
fans, in those parts where they hold
the power, did things which it would
be well if they repented of.
We are not excusing the South
Carolina democrats, and we join with
the Neus end Courier iii the demand
that Swntle he left unmolested. He
is a bad fellow-we have seen the
evidence of that-- but he is no worse
than many South Carolina democrats
who think themselves respectable
nmen, and it will not do to molest him.
But republicans in the North would
do better to encourage and support
such appeals for ustice and good
sense as the News and Coier mikes
than to seise apon them as occasions
for reviling the Sooth. The Nsou
says :-",wails is an arrrnt knave.
Are the people of Williamsburg afraid
of him? The courts will take in
stant aogalacee of any ofence that
he may commit. So long as be is
not tried and convicted be has the
aime right to live in peace and quiet
in Williemaburg county, or any other
county, that any other citisea of the
State has, whether white or black."
Surely that is not a sentiment which
ought to be sneered at. And surely
the republicans ought to he careful
not to Ax public attention too closely
aon the events of 1876 and 1878. They
cannot afford to have it remembered
that the famous, or rather infamous,
tisane ballots nued by the Booth Car.
olina democrats last year were a ret
publican invention used nrst by that
party in 1876 to carry the Florida
election; they should be glad to have
it forgotten that is the Sea Island
region of South Carolina it was less
piossible for democrats to gain a safe
hearing than in the uplands for a re.
publican to make himself heard in
quiet. So far as the South is con.
cerned the republicans live in a very
gl glasls house, and they ought to
prohibit their people from throwing
stones.
A Corempondent writes: "Sitting at
the Aquarioum last wk, wateling the
