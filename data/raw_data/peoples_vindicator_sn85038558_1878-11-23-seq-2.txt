Our worthy GIvernt wanlts to know depe
''why the Relublicans c;'led the ne- latur
groes in mass meeting on the same party
day, and at the same place the Demo- from
crats had long before adrertised for." TI
Of course, George L. didn't know; ette
and when Governor Nicholls suggest- cals,
ed it was done to "inrvite the issue" of Rept
which they comIplained, of course, the 1
Smith and his Committee were crowd- full
edl down. Here then is the poi t Avt
which Blunt was dodging all the time. el
His whole effo't is to belittle the ocrs
meeting lie had called into a simple and
"ward gathering" brought together publ
for the purpose of electing "ward
managers." Blunt may be a "God Ac
feat ing" man, but in politics and war
lhe'nmakes a track as "'big as a mack- the 4
anaw blanket." Now the VINDICA- maji
Tout knows when, how, and who call- El
edt this ward Radical meeting. Blunt Cool
called together his gang, a little after wen
sunset on September 14th, at an of- Stat
tice on Church street in this city, and all t
then consumated his plan to "bluff shot
the D)emocrats of Natchitoches." He tion
~was advised by lRepublicans, and we have
can face him with the men if he de- Roo
sires, not to call the meeting for the T
day and for the purpose. He was bast
told by them it would result just as furr
it did result; and his henchman, crat
Raby, publicly stated, not four days cam
before the riot, that "the whites had Hop
better keep to their homes and not are
go night hawking around." Raby T
admits this, or did admit it after his jor
capture, but insistd lihe was "in fun. soli
The easnlt of the election in this ishe
iparish shows what prompted Blunt.
The thousand colored men who voted (
the straight Democratic ticket had to ChE
be got back into line. They were gone, full
and gone forever, into the Democrat
ic fold unless the race war, the bloody th
shirt and incendiarism could be re
iunagurated. Honest local govern- ,
Sauncet, honest State government had net
stamped out the Blunts here, unless soc
r he could "bluff the whites," and hl hai
, made the effort with the result lie wh
e now bewails.
Strange as it may appear, yet we
can prove it and will do so when the De
necessity adises, there are hundreds a,
of colored men who have within the Lo
last 30 days proclaimed it their priti- ore
leqe to hang Blunt if he returned. "He wi
has been our ruin," say they; "he has
led us estray, lied to as and kept us
from our natural friends, the whites, ed
and we demand to be his execution- thi
ers." , '
1 Already the curses of thousands of
is colored people here follow him, and
. if he believes in God, which we
doubt, he must have, recourse to un
ceasing prayer to overcome, at His
n Throne, tihe appeals of all these
e whom he has deluded and outraged
id for his condemnation.

S There can be no question but what
t- there are grose frauds being perpetrated
on the charitable dispencers of the bon
o ty so generously sent us by the citizens
" of other cities. Yesterday afternoon one
to case was brought to light. One H. C.

m' brandy or whiskey at the rooms of the
d Howard Ass6ciation, and each time he
has recieved what he required.
Ic- Matters begin to be suspicious and an
u, invistigation was made when it was
found that his claims for aid from the
Y* Ilowards were unfounded. Last evening
he he attempted to get more liquor when he
was detected and promptly ejected from
o the rooms of the Howards. He had, it
le was stated, received from several mem
3s bers of the Howards liquor for sick chil
dren by imposing on the generosity of
!- those who are too busy with their work
it of charity to inquire closely into every
tg case.-N. O. Democrat.

st, leans dispatches in the Shreveport
c; Evening STANDARD, that, "as the
ad Constitutional Amendments are de
ed feated, it is feared the call for a Con
ob stitutional Convention will be neces
ad sitated."
1W, We are utterly astonished that
cr. such stuff should be telegraphed to
en any North Louisiana paper. "'Fe"r

Iey tion Certainly no politician or
no statesman worthy the name in this

Vagaries of the CaUwMns.
I)r. R,,berteon, of St. Landry, is a
"'neW ashool" Democrat. He was D
Chairman of the Ceutral Executive vi
Committee of the Democratic party of '
that parihi, and supported the In- ei
dependent candidate for the Legis- ci
lature against the nominee of his b
party. Robertson should be retired a'
from Democracy with a leather tuedal. 1
The Democracy of Ascension as- tl
serted itself by fusing with the Radi- a
cals, and supporting Landry, colored a
Republican for the Senate. Of course 14
the Democracy of that parish is brinm tl
full of principle.
Avoyellessucceeded in splitting her- "
self wide open. She got in one Dem
ocrat for the legislature, Mr. Coco,
and a"mild Republican." "Mild Re- ti
publican" is good. a
Assumption, the home of Governor t
Nicholls, went back on his "policy" to
the extent of giving the Radicals 400
majority.
East Baton Rouge wanted a new a
Constitution bad ; at least the parish t
went sojdA for Baton Rouge as the c
State Capital, and equally solid for t
all the Amendments. Brother Annis r
I should have told us before the elee c
tion "that was how," and we would g
have plumped 2816 against-Baton I
Rouge, just for revenge. t
The Ring men around New Orleans I
based their calculations on that city
s furnishing the majority for the Demo
cratic party, but when the country 1
I came in with over 35,000 majority, I
I Howard & Co., tore their hair, we I
t are told.
Tensas went Democratic by a ma
jority of 2900. Now, we call that a
solid example for the "fusion par
s ishes" to follow.

_ - A 'WARNING.
We have a warning to give the
Democracy of this State, now that
victory has been again given them.
We found it the hardest work of the
canvass to convince the white De,,o
crat that our party was not responsi
ble for the groas sln of commission
and omission of the last legiinlatute.
The masses contended, and justly
that they had been promised tfor'nm,
a correction of Radical abnae., and
an honest Constituition, and that lhe
legislature had insultingl%? elcsived
them. However, our people rallled
tio a 1an Oil the aianrance t:.at those
pledges should be kept fait hfutlly and
honestly in the future, andl wj,
warn tile Democratic pnlt vy of
this State of this flct, that if
they fail to call a Constitntion-l
al Convention for an early lday, at
the coming Session of the General
Asnembly, the fate of the party is
sealed.
It will be beaten in every nook
and corner of the State, as it deserves
to be beaten. If any parish in this
State, whose voters favor a Constitu
rtional Convention, have returned a
t member of the last Assembly, who
voted then against a call, under his
I promise to do better next time, they
I have, we fear, done themselves and
tie State a great wrong. The man
a who, when brought face to face with
an issue, fails, and fails as signally
- and as blindly as many failed in the
last Assembly, should never again be
trusted to a post of danger or im
e portance.
We feel fully assured that there
will be no back sliding this time. The
people of Louisiana have spoken an
- thunder tones for an honest Con
C stitution, and they will be heeded.
