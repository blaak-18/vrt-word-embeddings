are being sacrifieced to a
senseless war. Governmental blun
ders may suffice to overthrow the
throne itself.
The disruption of Church and State
is also a probable outcome. Spain
has long suffered under priest-rule
and is eager to rid itself of the bur
den.
The cry of “Down with Diaz” has
been heard very ominously in Mexi-
co during the past week.

hold on for nearly a
quarter of a century. At Guadala
jara, the second largest city in Mexi
co, has occurred the worst rioting
known in years. An increasingly
strong political party, calling itself
democratic, opposes the re-election
of Diaz and is running as its candi
date Gen. Barnado Reyes, formerly
minister of war in Diaz’s cabinet and
now governor of Neuve Leon. Dur
ing the disturbances some American
property is said to have been destroy
ed and a couple of Americans wound
ed, while many Mexicans have been
hurt. The mutterings of discontent,
some weeks ago, were sought to be
quieted by the Diaz faction when the
President promised a fair and square
election; but unless all reports be
grossly untrue, fair dealing is a thing
practically unknown and unpracticed
in Mexico. Porfirio Diaz has been
one of the strongest, shrewdest, suav
est politicians who ever acted upon a
national stage; he has always been
careful to keep his neighbor on the
north perfectly satisfied, by protect
ing American capital and citizens.
With his own people, he has been a
despot who hesitated to employ no
method to crush revolt. He is an old
man and instead of allowing the
Mexican people to choose his suc
cessor, he is attempting to make the
selection himself by having re-elected
with him a vice-president upon whom
his mantle would fall. From the riot
ing to an actual revolution would be
a very short step at the present mo
ment, particularly should anything
happen to Diaz.
The political upheaval has been
accompaniel by successive convul
sions of nature, shaking Mexico City
and working havoc along the Pacific
coast and in the valleys. Acapulco
and Guerro have been destroyed.

The situation is said to be critical,
though why the Cretans should not
annex themselves to Greece without
opposition from Turkey, or partition

of the little island is probably a re

British courts give short shrift, and
for the sinner of the subject nation
there was no sympathy. When the
sentence was pronounced, the prisoner
said:
“I thank you, my Lord. I am proud
to have the honor of laying down my
humble life for my country. Your
sentence of death is perfectly illegal.
You are all powerful and can do what
you like; but remember, we will have
the power some time. That is all I
have to say.”
The three lives thus blotted out are
probably but the beginning of many
more that will go the same way. The

of oppression is a suitable-for-the

came to a decision
which indicates that “somebody
lied.” Declaring Miss Gingles
innocent of the charge of steal
ing, it likewise declared Miss
Barette guiltless of the charges
brought against her, which were of
exceedingly grave character, em
bracing almost inconceivable bru
talities practised on the young Gin
gles girl to force her into the life of
a “white slave.” The latter con
sistently contended that the charge
of stealing the pieces of lace was
trumped up for the purpose of effec
tually preventing her revelation of
white slave iniquities. What is the
real truth in this case will never be
known, but it is very significant
that the graft investigation started
by the State attorney, John E. W.
Wayman, has already uncovered a
horrible condition of affairs in Chi
cago, showing that certain members
of the police force have grown rich
by collusion with just such horrors
as the Irish lacemaker sought to de
pict. The revelations to follow on
the heels of the first information
given out will probably appall the
average American citizen, to whom
such a thing as the white slave traffic
seems remote or absurd. The shake

ably make that of Pittsburg seem
mild and gentle.

used was a monoplane, heavier than
air. While the Wright brothers and
others have demostrated the possi
bility of flying, the feat of M. Ble

tacular proof that the art of aerial
navigation is at last wuthin human
comprehension. The day of the
English insularity is over; and the

more or less. The perfection of the

mankind. With them, no region

navy could successfully stand, and
even the blessed Protective Tariff
System might ultimately go into the

The new novel by Zach McGhee,
which begins in the August number
of Watson’s Magazine, is a story of
the South as it is today, written by a
Southerner. It sparkles with humor,
is full of quaint characters, and its
plot is exciting.
