Let us hope that the year which
has just begun will be better than
the one just closed.
The special edition of the Lake
Charles Commercial is an exceed
ingly well gotton up paper.
Richard Crocker, the ex-chief of
Tammany, and Congressman
Bourke Cockran a shinning light of
the famous society, are at lo.eger
heads and are calling each other
very ugly names.
Samuel C. Seeley, a Napoleon of
Finance who got away with the
snug sum of half a smillion dollars,
wilT spend eight years in the New
York penitentiary.
Ex-Judge E. T. Lewis of St.
Landry has been appointed to suc
ceed Judge Perry on the Circuit
bench. The appointmgnt was in
the nature of a surprise as the resig
nation of Judge Perry seems tohave
been kept secret.
All honor to the Times-Demo
crat for its noble efforts to raise a
sum of money for the relief of the
maimed Confederate veteran. In
last Monday's issue of that enter
"prising journal we were pleased to
see that the handsome sum of
$x a. 5 had already been contri
buted for the oAd veteran.
If reports of the assassination at
Rayne of poor Mac Lyons are cor
rect, it was the most cowardly and
fiendish murder committed in this
section since many years. The
dead officer was one of the best
men in Acadia parish and his death
at the hands of a blood-thirsty as
sassin is to be deeply regretted.
Let speedy and rigid justice be
meted out to the murderer.
The congressional jaw will begin
to clatter away as usual next Thurs
dlay. The unwearied and relentless
congressional larynx will renew its
old 'time jamboree; the forever
going congressional tongue will heap
higher and still higher the melan
choly wordpile of the Congressional
Record; and the insatiiate congress
ional mouth will continue to thicken
.he mental murkiness that shrouds
the national capital as with a som
bre pall. No ray of ho.e pierces
the duncloud of smoke that rolls
from the gaping chimneys of the
country's word factory. Amid the
wild din of thundering lungs, roar
ing mouths and clashing jawbones,
the congressional intellect sleeps
like Napoleon on the field of battle.
There will be nothing done by this
Congress:-Memphis Commercial
Appeal,
The election contests in Ailabs:i,:.
Tennessee and the charges ot f.aud
in other Southern States should set
Southerners to thinking. The pres
ent election laws are evidently in
adequate to preserve the purity of
the ballot and unless something is
done well and at once this whole
sale robbery of public offices will
inevitably lead to complete demor
alization. In our own Louisiana
elections are not what honest peo
ple would like to see them. Titles
to offices tainted with fraud are
unfortunately too numerous. Men
are beginning to-look upon politics
as they do upon bunco games-the
"iggest rascal wins.
Instead of going on the stage
Madeline Pollard is engaged in the
noble'work of dispensing charity in
New York. Evidently poor MIad

The Vicksburg (Miss.) Post does
not want the planters to raise less
cotton: Some wiseacres advocate
a reduction of cotton acreage in the
South next season, arguing that this
method will result in an advance in
prices. We think the advice, and
the conclusibns; are, perhaps, both
mistakes. If cotton production for
the world were confined to the
Southern States the plan would
work nicely. But as cotton is rais
ed to a large extent in Egypt and
other foreign countries, a reduction
of acreage in this country would in
evitraby result i- the increase of
acreuge and stimudation of cotton
production in foreign countries.
"Ihe .bstm will renew its recommen
dation to the farmers and planters
of the South to raise as much cot
tan as possible, always provided,
however, that they raise a suffici-nt
.aefilj cf orcact un, bres'a: for Le.c
wants of the cotton section. Un
der these circumstances cotton' will
be a surplus and money clop, and
our section will be prosperous.
The idea is to increase the acreage
of oats, corn, peas, etc., and de
vote proper attention to stock rais
ing. This of itself will, to some
extent reduce the cotton acreage.
However, the South must maintain
its supremacy as the principal cot
ton producing portion of the world.
The race war at Quitman, Ga.,
is one of those periodical outbreaks
that will occur as long as the two
races live together. Such things
are certainly deplorable but they
are unavoidable and will continue
to mar the peace of this Southern
country. Blacks and whites can
no more live peaceably together
than cats and dogs can eat in the
same plate and maintain harmony.
We may talk about the good feelings
that exist between the two races,
and at times the white and the
black man will get along well, but
this seeming cordiality is only short
lived and the inevitable racial
troubles are sure to follow.
JEALOUSY.
Journal of Education.
Who does not know the terrors of
jealousy? It has its germ in the
early years of chithood. Its' trans
ference to something better should
come early. It is, perhaps, the
most fiendish of human activities. It
is not only sure to make the one
who is jealous, frantic with miseries,
real or imagined, but it carries with
it vexation, to put it mildly, to
others. It rarely ends with jeal
ousy, but has its ramifications in
other emotions and activities.
The only real remedy is in the
development of a broad and gener
ous sympathy and benevolent ac
tion. Jealousy in essence is selfish
ness. The remedy is in unselfish
ness of the most pronounced char
iter. A thild's generous impulses
may be relied upon if appealed to
early enough. A child will do
more for the good it will do and
the pleasure it will give than from
any other motive, if you can really
get his attention to that phase of a
given action. The jealous child
wishes every one to be doing for
him, and especially that they
should do more for him than for
another, even going so far as to de
mand that nothing shall be given to
or done for some other one. If he
can be studied closely and induced
to do much personally, and get
others to do for the one for whom
he really does not wish that any
thing should be done, and if this
training can be persisted in, his
jealousy will be tiansferred to a pos
itive blessing to mankind. His
own peace of mind will be assured,
he will be saved from a multitude
of ills to which a jealous person and
all his friends are subjected.
The Lexow committee did a sad
day's work when it ran down virtue's
own knight errant, Mr. Anthony
Co'stock, the most implacable
purluer of vice the world has ever
known. Anthony the Good! The
arch-enemy of undraped statuary.'
The indefatigable expurgator of un
clean literature! He that swaddled
the Alrpllo Belvidere with a horse
blanket and clothed the Venus de
Milo with a calico skirt-can it be
that this malitant Puritan, this
witch-burner of the nineteenth cen
tury, this incarnate ghost of the
blue laws has fallen victim to
satan's wiles?-Commercial Ap
peal.
The ladies belonging to the "400"
of Memphis are making things un
pleasantly warm for Col. Breckin
ridge, who was billed to lecture in
that city last Wednesday. The
Daughters of the American Revo
lution, a society composed of the
creme de la creme of Memphis
society, have issued an appeal to
their sisters to discountenance in
any manner or form any courtesy or
attention extended to the sinful lec
turer. It is doubtful if all this vir
tuous indignation on the part of the
aristocracy will accomplish any
thing. If the masses of common,
everyday folks want to hear the
erratic but eloquent Kentuckian
they will in all probability follow
their inclination despite all the royal
edicts from the "upper tens."
A New Story Writer.
Among the younger men who are
slowly working their way into cur
rent literature, and especially the
short story, is Walter 3Blackburn
Harte, whose name is already some
what familiar to a scattered public
of bookish people as the author of
certain literary and social essays
after the fashion of the earlier En
glish essayists. But today. the hrt
'.t;r"- !i~e th'r:2; :&r,d. I i.irt,- i: be
ginning to put forth some short
stories of New York street life,
mostly touching upon social ques
tions, that show a compact skill and
t'he faculty of telling a story in a
few words. "A Drama in Tatters,"
from his pen in the January Arena.
is an interesting bit of work, and it
is startlingly bold in its theme
without offending the most refined
taste.

Public Opinint.
New York Sun, (De.ln): We are enabled
on the highest authority to s:ate that Mes rs.
Joseph 11. Choate and Clarence A. Seward
regard the new income tax as unconstitu
tional; and that thes e:mietnt l.wyers will
represent a large bo:y of pubic-spiirted New
York nmerchants and business men who pro
pose to test the constitutionality of the law
in the courts.
New York Tribune (Rep.): Tihe Court of
Appeals has at last passe-d its verdict ot con
demnation on the Democratic theft of the
State Senate of 1892. The people h:t\e al
ready twice given their opinion of that in
famry in umtistakable terns. The decision
of the court comes late, but it is the fitting
climix in the series of righteous judgments
which should make forever implossible in
New York St.ate such another crime against
the suffrage as that which was planned Ir"
Hill, engineered by lMaynard and executed
by the State Board of Canvassers. The un
faithful State officers of ISgI must pay their
fines for contemtpt of court in canvassing the
fraudulent return from Dutchess county.
But that is not a severe penalty. The value
of the sentence imposed upon them is that
it puts the seal of the highest judicial con
demtnation upon thelir acts, andi againlst uchi
condertnation no cry of partisanshi will
av.il.
New York Commerci.el Advertiser: The
Odd Fellows, the Knights of Pythias and
thie Sons of Tenrperance have been added to
the Masons as objects of l'Papal denuncia
tion. After long consideration, the order
has been issued that the sacraments of the
Roman Catholic Church are to be denied to
any mcnljler of these secret societies, on the
ground that one of their aimts is to in
flict some sort ot injury on that clhurch.
This is giving a muighsty importance to amtia
blie andl harmless societies whles" secrecy
has no more dreadful purpoje than to grati
I fy a rather chilis. feeling. Long expe.
I rience hIas shown that nankind is as fond
of the munrmRnery of a secret inauguration as
it is of the gorgeous trappings, the waving
plumnes and glittering swords, the myste
rious signs and cabahstic designs of the nut
mnerous secret societices, an-I that they can
be held together for purely benevolent pur
poses by the use of thct.e dramatic forms
when they coulfd not without them.
