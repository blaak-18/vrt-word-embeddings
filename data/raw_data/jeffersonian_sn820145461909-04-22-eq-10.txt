not see him because he was gazing
back into Elaine’s eyes, trying to
frame an answer to her question.
'Deering was a vigorous, well-fed
looking individual, not beyond middle
age, who was as pink and fresh as
if he had just come from a cold bath
and a rub-down. He wore a little
orchid in his buttonhole. Elaine knew
instinctively that it was he. And be
sides she had seen in one of the Sun
day papers a picture of him and a
picture of his estate on Long Island
and one of his New York houses and
one of his greenhouses and another
of his kennels and a sixth of his steam
yacht. She wished that she had read
the article about how he had made his
fortune. But here he was —the- great
C. D. Deering himself.
Somehow the question “Can 1 live
on five?” still seemed to reverberate
on the air about the employment desk.
The young man still was hesitating for
his answer when he saw his chief out
of the corner of his eye, an;l jumped
to his feet.
‘‘Mr. Deering!” he said with a re
spectlul exclamation.
The mighty proprietor beamed upon
him with a sort of desperate kindness.
“Good morning,” he said. “Go right
ahead with the young lady.”
He had spoken; but at this moment
it occurred to Elaine that, as she was
about to take so important a step, she
had better consult an eminent authori
ty which chance had placed before
her. She looked squarely at Deering,
who had heard her question, and said,
“Cai. I?”
“This gentleman will give you all
information,” returned the great one.
“But I wanted to ask you,” she
said quickly.
“Me!” exclaimed Deering. With
a covert glance he discovered that the
employment agent now had drawn up
his selfish face into a dry, eyn'cal and
irritating smile, as if-delighted, that
the burden of an answer had been
shifted.
Deering beamed upon Elaine as he
had beamed upon the yoi’.i’g man. He
thought it best.
“You have not been here long?”
he inquired.
“No,” said Elaine. “I have no
folks and 1 don’t know much about
cities and stores. 1 thought you’d tell
me. ”
Deering seemed to reflect a moment.
Then he threw his head up impa
tiently and snorted.
“Try it!” he said.
W hen he had gone the yo ing man
gave Elaine a card to fill out.
“Profits in this store are not eco
nomic—they are social,” he said, as
if to himself.
“What?” said Elaine.
‘‘You have beautiful red-brown
hair,” said the cold young man.
Elaine was very angry with him for
saying it.
No one can tell very much about
Elaine’s story during the months that
followed. It is only useful to know,
as Mrs. Colvin-Everhard said, that it
was not until the selfish young man,
by two or three slow promotions, nad
become the glove buyer, that her ex
istence ever entered the mind of that
Napoleon of Emporiums. C. D. Deer
ing.
“John,” said he one morning to
the glove buyer, beaming upon him,
‘‘ I notice on the.<njrve sheet thafwp are
Gbe 3effersonlan
not doing as usual with the cheaper
long-length suedes. And, now that
I think of it, that imported line that
came in yesterday”—he paused to
allow his employee to be impressed
with his personal knowledge of the
details of his business —“I say that
imported line is a beautiful color —an
odd color. I never saw any color like
it — Huh! Yes. Do you remember
a girl that was in your office two years
ago looking for a job—with reddish
brown hair? Where did she go?”
The buyer’s mouth was full of two
words which he felt devilishly inclined
to say, but he only said, “She went.”
“Home?”
‘ i Hardly. ’ ’
It seems too bad to break the story
up, but it must be done because be
tween times no one but Elaine knows.
Then, too, the break has another dis
advantage, as the architect said who
listened to the story, for it makes the
ending perfectly obvious. This is a
crime in fiction, but not in a chronicle.
Any way it was not so very long
after Mr. Deering had the conversa
tion with the former employment
agent, whose pink bald spot had by
that time grown larger, when, one
morning as the dry-goods prince was
sitting at the massive mahogany desk
in his richly furnished and wainscoted
holy of holies, his son came in.
This was his only boy—a healthy,
fine-looking young man almost through
college, enthusiastic about life, unre
strained, and Deering loved him much.
His own hair was getting gray and
the unsophisticated, now serious, now
irresponsible nature of the son re
joiced the life of the older man. He
did not care much whether the young
ster, now already twenty-one, turned
out to be a good executive of depart
ment stores or not, if by being the
dreamer that he was he would go on
ever perpetuating the glad nature of
his dead mother.
“For heaven’s sake, boy, when did
you get home and why?” cried old
Deering with new vitality in his voice.
“I came over this morning,” said
the younger man. His upper lip quiv
ered a little. He semed to be excited
and half-frightened.
“Well —” said his father a little
anxiously.
“Do you know?”
“What? I know nothing. What?”
Out burst the story then —a cornu
copia of words and ideas, all the doubts
and all the assurance in the young
fellow’s nature. “I should have told
you, I know. It was awful to do
it that way— you’ll see what I
mean. Don’t jump to any con
clusions. You’ll be awfully angry
at first. You won’t like her. But you
will! You must! She’s had such an
awfully 'hard time!”
Deering turned white. He sat down
at his desk. His voice was dead.
“Tell me what you have to tell. Put
it so I can understand what you are
driving at.”
“Yes, sir. You see she is an ac
tress. She is an actress with a fear
fully cheap burlesque show. It was
awful to have a girl like that in such
a position—awful! Because she is
simply great herself —you know what
I mean—anybody would love her!
And she wanted to know if I could
forgive everything about her and I
told her yes and she told me and, my
God, I would too! She said I was the
only one she’d ever known that could
love unselfishly. She said that 1 was
little fool, But she told me some-
