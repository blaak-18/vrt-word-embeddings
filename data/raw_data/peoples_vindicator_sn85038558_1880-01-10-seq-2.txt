D. tr I enerned,i fis bees e'ttled.
This point having been reached, a
brief review of the events is Impor
to talt.
t The first ominous act of the third
b term party was the sudden lntroduc
tion of Senator Cameron into the
w National Committee, and his no less
sudden elevation to its obairma.n
be ship. Even the friends of the Sena.
lt tor have been euarous to know how
his pronouned victory was so quiet.
o lI achieved; for it was a matter of
in- notoriety that on the night before
of the session be lacked nine votes to
secure his succeses. But It is now as.
- serted that hisb entire strength in the
he commlttee at the hour of votlngl was
Is. not by any means shown; that all
,e that he desired to be shown was Just
enough votes to elect. Seoretlart
1 Sherman's fatal blunder In not form
ly ing a defensive alliance with Blain.
against Cameron, whether from fam.
is ily considerations or because of ut
ter hopelessness, seems to have
c- acused him, according to the best
n information, to say farewell to his
h Presidential aspirations. He has
lkst his identity in just the same de
gree that Blaine has lost his impor
' tanoe.
or The visit of Secretaries Sherman
. and Evarts now appears to have had
much real significance. During the
presence of Senator Cameron iu this
sit preliminary conference was
m. held, at which all the minor details'
Sof the Chicago Convention were art.
ranged. Another meeting was sub
_ sequently held at the Continental
SHotel, to which the Hayes branch of'
e the lRepubliam party was adamltted.
Before Itr conclusion perfect harmo.

SThe Important resul( of this gau

Dear Sir-After suffering for thirty 8f
year from a running ulcer in the ear
occasioned by a wagon passing on my
head and after having been operated
upon by Dr. Logan in New Orleans and
and not being cared, I tried some ofyour mi
balm and l am happy to say that after a lea
few applications of It I got entirely wellet
N and was radically cured. he
.. A negro boy on my place cut his foot hi
with a plow and It wasw thoughtonee h
that it would have to be amputated but ish
after applying your balm on the wound
for a few days it healed up and the boy
is now well. Again, Georg Cole, a
neighbor of mine, whilst shooting a gaun, -
a piece of the cap flew in his eye, we
tried the balm again and with success. Jo
His eye got well after two applications
of the balm.
I couclude b1 stating that in my opin.
ion your balm us an invaluable medicine
. anid I will take pleue peu in recommend. r
lag it to the public.
S Very respectfrlly, se•i
