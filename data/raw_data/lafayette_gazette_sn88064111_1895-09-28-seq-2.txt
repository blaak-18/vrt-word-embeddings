A STRANGE MLEETING.
There was a meeting at Domi
nique Boneaud's in the first ward
last Sunday, and from all accounts
it was one of the most dismal fail
ures that it has ever been our duty
as a journalist to chronicle. By
what authority it was convened we
are unable to say. It was certainly
not vested with authority by the
'parish committee for that honorable
body has not yet come together;
and it is hardly probable that it has
received its powers from a higher
authority such as Chairman WVilkin
son of the State Central Committee,
or Harrity of the National organi
. zation, and we do not believe that
even the "'Society for the Crema
*tion of Bosses and Dictators"
could be guilty of such a breach of
Democratic etiquette. Like kings,
perhaps the organizers of this singu
lar convention, disregarded all
earthly sources for a bestowal of
power, and believed themselves
designated by divine inspiration to
shape the political destinies of the
first ward of Lafayette parish.
The meeting was called to order
by a gentleman of pronounced anti
administration proclivities, who
proceeded to explain that its pur
pose was to nominate a candidate
for Police Juror of the ward, stat
ing that said candidate would be
entitled to the undivided support of
the Democratic party. Though
this declaration might have ema
nated from a high authority, few of
the gentlemen present would be
reconciled to this manner of noini
nating a candidate. The chairman,
who, it seemed, was beat on making
ferocious onslaughts on Cushing's
parliamentary laws, announced that
he would appoint six gentlemen who
would in turn appoint six others,
the twelve to constitute a committee
to select a candidate for Police
Juror. It was a hard matter to find
twelve gentlemen willing to serve on
the committee, but finally the re
quired number was secured. The
committee then retired and after
mature deliberation made a report 1
to the chairman who proclaimed
that the result was the nomination
of Mr. Alonzo Lacey, a worthy citi
zen of that ward, for Police Juror.
The chairman stated that Mr. Lacey
was selected by a majority of one,
which, by the way, is quite strange
when it is considered that the com
mittee was composed of twelve r
members. By what process of fig
uring this remarkable conclusion p
was reached will probably remain
one of the strange features of this is
very strange meeting.
The Gazette is reliably informed IL
that the choice of the committee
was not submitted to the converntion, w
but it was declared irrevocable and
binding. Few will insist that this cI
way of nominating a candidate: is in 1
consonance with Democratic usage, s
but all will concede that is a de '
sided improvement on the jury sys
temni. In criminal cases the verdict
must be unanimous and in civili
suits two-thirds are required to ren
der a judgment, but here we are hi
presented with a case where the
majority of one in a jury of twr'de- lii
sett'es the point at issue beyond th
dispute. w
The majority of those present I
were attracted there through c:trios- It:
ity and loo~ked upon the whole pro
ceetlings as a huge joke.
â€¢ VOT SO DARK.
em
'Thingsn may not be as bright as e
they nusl to be, or as they should tr
:he b. tO the one who has watched si
..~odiei ) the actual trend of business, w
is it not manifest that tile tidle of
Sprosperity is slowly but surely turn- G"
Sing f t mere fact that values to
Shave stopped in their declining "
"onurse, is, in itself a most encour- th
"aghg. indication, but the further
. fact that the) hav. even started to wi
go up a clear evidence of a de- Pi
:.ci.ed improyement. The time has1
been-nd it is not to l-ng agoat
~ither-that the dark c& of dis- re.
icouragment hung heal .y over the wl
Sitole situation. No one had en- p
. ry. t eonfidence, or self-reliance "
to attempt at. y enterprise, I
y seemed to appre- 5
a~t sa abstte coaPSe v.*.i~s; t
what the near future had in store
for us. Now, there is, undoubted
t. y, a more hopeful feeling. In our
own little town, there are indisputa
'. ble proofs that trade has b-en steadily
improving. A number of large
houses have been built, a sugar re
f finery is in the course of construc
tion, and innumerable other things
may be cited to prove that we should
not take a too pessimistic view of
the present and future.
be When the Wilson tariff bill be
pA
came a law, the Republican press
d prophesied all sorts of dire results,
- but despite all this foreboding
there is irrefutable evidence that the
ii- general trade of the country is
rd experiencing a healthy growth.
ts The instinctive kicker may tell
3- us that we are optimistic and tnere
ty is no fact on which to base the
ly hope that there are better times
re ahead. One might as well say that
ly because the sun can not be seen in
re all its splendor there will be no day.
le The glimmer of light which may be
r; seen above the horizon is a sure
as sign that before long the sun of
er prosperity will pierce its way through
1- the vanishing clouds.
C, NE IFSPAPERS IN SCHOOLS.
What the- practical teacher has
always done in. the spare moments
of his school day, educators are
now suggesting as a systematic fea
ture of the instruction we give to
s' youth. There is an element of
absurdity in acquainting young
minds with the minutiae of classic
history, while permitting them to
remain comparatively, and in many,
o cases totally, ignorant of contempo
eary events. Perhaps it is due to,
this perversion of good s nse that c
the very name of scholar is fre- I
quently associated in the public
0 mind wit:. a person standing aloof i
from living things and absorbed in
e the men and affairs of other ages.
This mummified species of classic
e ism is going out of favor. The'
past and the present are both inter- f
esting as battlefields of the great !
war of humanity. But the one is
strewn with mounds and headstones
e and crumbling skeletons, the other t
with actual breathing men. To be
sure it is clouded with the smoke of
g conflict and cannot be so distinctly c
s studied. But there is value in leal
ing even young children up to the
edge and showing them the fray in i
which later they must take part as
combatants. f
The proposition has . been t
made to use the newspapers
as aids in the new course of instruc
tion. There are excellent weekly a
Sdigests of current affairs wvhich are 4
r worthy in every respect to stand
beside the text-books commonly ic
used. The suggestion is interest
ing, both as a sign of progress in
educational science and as a fresh b
recognition of the position which: t
journalism occupies in modern life.
Pa'wnee Bill's (-Great Comnbined fi
Shows.n
A new and desirable era has been inaugu- tc
rated by the fortuitous blending of these
great combined shows. What the Pawnee l

past 12 years is so patent it. everybody, that ic

the lily to descant on its well-knuown super- i

Lincoln's Helcsitancy To Marry. L
Letters from Lincoln to his clos- ed
est frientl, Joshta Fry Sleed, sub- va
sequttent to the latter's mnarriage. be- i"
tray an anxious and impl>atient de- ye
sire to learn if marriage is a path- "
way of flowers anti sllalight, and an
not of darknjes antd pain the two ain
hadl morbidly feared it to bc. John de
Gillner Speed presents these hither- i-P
to unpublished letters bearing upon vI
"Licoln's Hesitancy to Mcarrv.' in
the October i.adlies' Home Journal.
In one L.incoln says: la
"It cannott be told how it now thrills me p
with jroy to hear you say yout are "fnr hap- zet
pier than you ever expectel to ie.' That pa
mttcl I know is enougt. I know you two
well to sapp,se your expectations were not,
at least sonmetimes, extravagant, ald if the eCXj
reality exceeds then nall, Isay, enough dear of
Lord. I am not going beyond tile truth 29,
when I tell you that the short space it took I Ir
ate to read vour last letter gave me more
pleastrst thaI the sum total of all I haIse en- 1o0
nyed since the fatal first of January, 1341. clu
Since then, it Seems to ame, I should have sai
been entirely happy but for tl'e never-ab-I
sent idea that there is or.e (referring to Miss th
.May Todd) who ja t;il unhappy., whom 1 Car
re kills y soul. I cannot but reproach my
self for even wishing to be happy while she
t- is otherwise. She accompanied a large
party in the railtoad cars to Jacksonville
last Monday,-and on her return spoke so
a- that I heard of it, of having enjoyed the
trip exceedingly. God be praised for that.
One thing I can tell you which I know you
Ce will be glad to hear, and that is that I have
. seen Mary and scrutinized her feelings as
well as I could, and am fully convinced she
C- is far happier now than she has been for the
s last fifteen months past."
Id Eight months after Speed had
married Mr. Lincoln wrote him:
f "But I want to ask a close question:
'Are you now in feeling as well as judgment
e. glad that you are married irs you are?'
From anybody but me this would be an im
SS pudent question not to be tolerated; but I
know you will pardon it in me. Please an
swer it quickly, as I am impatient to know."
ig Mr. Lincoln's object in asking
1e this "close question:'" is manifest.
is Mr. Speed gave the answer quickly
and sat;sfactorily, and on the
11 fourth of November (1842), one
month exactly after the question
re had been submitted, Mr. Lincoln
1e was married.
