Market Review.
S. I
Areview of the local meret of a
ecuntry town Is something new as
well as interesting. Ntebhitoebes is
on old place and Tler cýnumeroial La.
portance at one time ranked very
high. In fact, the impolrtance of the
trade of this section at one time can
scarcely be comprehended, and but
few would believe that the City of
Mexico and all the intervening coun
ury was a trade tributary -to talpt-.
Itoohes. Straonge as It may seem; It
is nevertheless true. The old "Ban
Antonio Trace," the highway over
which passed the wealth of its cattle
and ponles, packed trains of hides.
peltries, horns, tallow, jerked meats
and venison, can yet be easily fol
lowed and marked by its deep cuts
through hill and vale, worn by the
countless thousands who have, in
times gone-by, traversed it. In our
boyhood days it Was our wont to
wander down some well marked por
tion of this old "trace." and imagine
the feelingsa looks and habits of
them early people who passed along
its route. Oar earliest recolleetios
are filled with the wonderful stories
of the sliver ore, its vast quantlites,
no doubt augmented many folds to
enhance the lnterest of the story,
which used to jess over this trace to
Natchitoches laden on mules: many
hundred being in each train.
A writer, fifty years ago, In speak
lug of Natchitoches, say: "The
8panish trade for a considerable dis.
tance into the interior of It M ul
aan States centse llfezAn Idis b
great thoroughbi Itp' r0-WOlinlt
to and returning from those States.
The trade from them is chiefly in
bars of silver, and horses and mules.
We send them in return manufactur
ed goods, groceries, spirits and tobac.
co " The outlet for opr pro4uoe at
ht k i a oNew Orlemsnihough
ar t con4v g4e 7t with
shat city for it. Keelboats were our
mode then of water-travel and our
freight carriers, and the time consum
ed in a voyage to and frpm New Or.
leans was forty days. Besides the
trade In silver, hides, horn, peltries,
and dried meats from the West; large
quantities of tobacco and indigo were
grown in this section; Innumerable
herds of at Auq a b
our hmvand
the Bed rivS p q in
the best idl6lg" "
Even now the amounl of eooton re I
celved here is no ndleatlon of the d
traie of our merchants In meroPq- .
dise, fora large number who trade t
with them ship their cotton directliy f
to New Orleans from the several c
Muditae on the rivers. ;t In0y be 1(
safely estimated that the business of *
the place, jugded upon the value of )
cotton handled, aieounts to quite b
1,000 bales. That our trade is ex
tensive the number of our business l
firms, their stocks and proupfflt~
give acmple evidence. We have of h
houses that deal In dry-goods exelu- b
slvely one, in dry  ad
nineteen, In I
in drugs two, iln iqss nd eaigrs ,
four, in tin ware and torales two, in o
wagon makinl repairln and black.
smithing three, in trniture maknlo ~
and repairing one, in toys and fancy ,
attleles one. We have three good *
Iotels and two restaurants and a Sne
livey stable.
Our professional sad trade bsh -
nes is a well represented, for we i
