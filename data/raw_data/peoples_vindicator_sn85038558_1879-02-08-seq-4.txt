TEN CENTS.
("#This Special Offer is made to enable the
Sou heofrn pope to s e for themselves how good
a pper TITE'WORLJ) isand Low worthy it is
of their sudport.
On the 1st of Mayr, Ie6, the ownership and
controle of TIHE WORL) passed into thie hands
of the undersigned, nder whose absholute and
untramamelled directions THE WORIL) has
ever since remained and now remains
During the whole of this time TIHE WORLD
has labored patiently andperseveringly for the
accomplishment of two objects in politics of
paramount interest to the Southern people.
I. The restoration of Local Selftiovernment
at the South.
II. A Real Reform of the Civil Service, in
such wise as to destroy the political machines
nrder the opperation of which it has come to
pass that the people are taxec to support politi
cal parties, wheaeas political parties have no
ushr reason of belag except to Ilsen the bur
den on the government.
The drat of themse objects have been triunmph
antly accompllshed. A'1 inteligeat Northen
haen new admilitthat all parts of tb. euntrv
were as deeply interestedas the goiin seeluig
it wa.. kerreupt sad st=$I- nlerg govern.
meat in the South was a permanent peril to the
ascendancy of true American principles in the
Federal Government and therefore to the peace
and honor of the whole people.
The second political object for Which THE
WORLD contends still remains to be fully ach
ieved. The actual Administration began its
career with excellent promises in this direc.
tion of which it is suicient to sav that ther
have been as yet only in part redeemed. THk
WORLD for its part will resolutely support any
honest efforts to redeem these promises fully,
by whosoever made, and will as resolutely ale.
donace every obstical thrown in the way of re
deeming them, from whatever quarter
It seems to the undersigned eminently proper
that he should ask the co-operation of the best
men of the South with THE WORLI)n its f
fortao carry out the policy here outlined. He
believes THE WORLD to be a piper which
Southern citizens and Democrats can recoin
oiend to Southern readers asan iutluece worthy
and important to be brought to hear with coin
stently increasing power upon our national atf
airs, in the Interest of truth. of justice and of
armonv among our people of all sections.
It is my desire to keep THE WORLD in a
lively relation with the best thoughts of the
o1t,. to the end tht the best idens. wishes
and fdelings of the Southern people may be
clearly and fairly known to the ,North* the East
and the West. Alike in prtrate and ir public
affairs the misunderstanding of men by one an
other liesat the root of so much evil that the
word itself has come to be a synonym with
qarreling and strife. It was a wlo saying of
Lord 1gll, at tte ef on6 of our sharpest
dispetee with O Britalin, that two intelli
gent geetbain alone en a raft in the Atlantic
with plenary power could adjust the whole mat
ter hnorably in an hour.
THE WC LD simply asksh its friends at the
South to aid it in bringing about a complete
meetin of ainds on a public questions be
tween ie telligeatý citizen of a part of the
Union, WILLIAM HENRY HURLBERT.
