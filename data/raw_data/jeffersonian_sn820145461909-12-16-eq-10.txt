OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
A CHRISTMASTIDE GIRL.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here I come
again. Christmas will soon be here.
I am always glad when Christmas
comes; we have such nice times.
My birthday is at Christmas time —
the twenty-seventh. Papa thinks
Mr. Watson is the greatest man in
America; he is always glad when
The Jeffersonian comes. He has to
read everything in it before he is
satisfied. I am thirteen years old.
I remain, with best wishes to The
Jeffersonian. — Minnie Winn, Rt. No.
2, Royston, Ga.
FROM THE SUNNY SOUTH.
Dear Dac4dy Jim: —After perusing
your page of correspondence from all
over our great country, and not see
ing anything from my home, I
thought I would write you, and let
you know you had a little friend
down here also. I am a little girl
eleven years of age. I am in the
sixth grade at school. I have an ex
cellent teacher and enjoy going to
school very much. I have two broth
ers and three little sisters. Daddy
has a nickname for all of us to tease
us. I enjoy reading the letters of
your little friends very much. I
have just read one from a little girl
at Centralia, Mo., who invited you to
come and spend Thanksgiving with
her, that pleased me very much.
Now Daddy Jim, while we have the
most delightful climate on earth,
and are enjoying the most beautiful
sunny Indian Summer day while I
am writing this letter, at the same
time I almost envy the position of
this cheerful little Missouri girl with
all of her healthy sports—riding,
skating, and sleighing. And it must
be great to be in a country where
you never see a negro, for they are
filthy-looking things. Daddy likes
the way Mr. Watson writes about
the Foreign Missions, because we
live adjacent to some of the pauper
ized districts of our city and a walk
through them, any time, divulges
some of the most wretched cases of
ignorance, poverty, and suffering;
and as this is only a small city it
must be dreadful in the big cities.
For fear I write too much, I will
close by saying to our friend Imo
gene that it’s delightful on the ve*.
randa in the sunshine today; it
makes me almost shiver to think of
her snow-clad fields. Goodbye.—
Your little friend, Iradelle Bateman,
1326 May Ave., Augusta, Ga.
FROM TENNESSEF—WELCOME.
Hello, Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I
come, for the first time, to join your
happy band. I live one mile from
town, on a farm. I have one brother
and two sisters. I have lots of pets:
a colt, a cow and calf, and one cat.
Papa takes your paper and I like it
fine. I am twelve years old, and go >
to school. lam in the fifth and sixth
grades. As my letter is getting long,
I will close. —Irene Clark, Route 3,
Atoka, Tenn.
KANSAS FOR WATSON.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here I am
again. This is my third attempt. I
want to try to get the Christmas
present. I live on a farm. Igo to
school every day except Saturday
and Sunday. My papa takes Mr.
Watson’s Jeffersonian paper and
Magazine. Papa and I think there
Obe Jeffersonian
is no man like Thomas E. Watson.
When I get to be a man, I’ll skin
the woods for him; and you see if I
don’t. I think that Mr. Watson will
be President, and I hope to live to
see him the President of the United
States. I am twelve years old. I
am in the fourth grade; would be
farther in my studies but never got
to go to school. I think I have done
real well for the length of time I
have gone. I study Reading, His
tory, Arithmetic, Grammar, Geogra
phy and Spelling. Hoping to see my
letter in print, I remain.—-Thomas
H. Gibbins, Route 7, Olathe, Kans.
INVITATION FROM OKLAHOMA.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here comes a
little Oklahoma girl. I am fifteen
years old; have blue eyes, dark hair
and fair complexion. Little girls in
Georgia, I guess some of you know
me. My papa and mamma were born
and raised forty miles east of At
lanta, and we went back there to
visit this summer. I liked many
people I met in Georgia. I also went
to Alabama, where my grandpapa is
staying with my two uncles. He is
about eighty-six years old, and I had
never seen him. Papa and mamma
left Georgia twenty years ago, and
had never gone to see grandmamma
and grandpapa until this summer.
Daddy Jim, come out and take
Christmas with us, and see how you
like away out here in Oklahoma. I
; ve in the country, but am sure you
would enjoy the ride. Who has my
birthday, September 2 7th? Miss An
nie Mae, I will answer your riddles:
first, a nail; second, a needle. As
this is my first attempt to write to
the Post-Card Club, I will close by
asking a riddle. With love to the
many little readers, and Daddy Jim
also. “’Tis a very, very brilliant
thing, but hasn’t any mind, and it
travels through the darkness with its
headlight on behind.” Who can an
swer this?—Your little friend, Lillie
Mae Tilley, Stilwell, Okla.
WANTS TO EXCHANGE CARDS.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l thought I
would write you a letter. Irma lit
tle girl ten years old. Igo to school
and like my teacher very well. His
name is Frank White. I would like
to exchange post-cards with the boys
and girls. I have not had any help
with this letter. —Your friend, Ina
Rose, Windsor, 111.
ANOTHER NEW MEMBER.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I am a little
girl eleven years old. I am in the
fifth grade. I like to go to school
very much. I have four brothers and
three sisters. We are going to move
down in Green county, week after
next. I like to read your paper.—
Your new friend, Edna Bond, Bo
gart, Ga.
WOKING FOR A PRESENT.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I thought I
would come again, as I didn’t win
any of the other prizes. We are done
picking cotton and I sure am glad,
for I don’t like to pick much. I am
going to school now and sure do like
my teacher; her name is Miss Lora
Anderson. I live about eight miles
from Collinsville, on Lookout Moun
tain. I go to Sunday-school nearly
every Sunday. I guess I had better
describe myself. lam thirteen years
old, and four feet high, have light
hair and gray eyes. Now lam look
ing for one of those Christmas pres
ents. if my letter does not get to the
waste basket. —Your true friend (for
we all think there’s no one like Mr.
Watson), Gertrude White, Route 4,
Collinsville, Ala.
YOUR MAMMA IS RIGHT.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l will write a
letter so I can get a post-card from
you. It will tickle me to get one
from you, but I think when you are
so good to us little boys and girls
we ought to give you something. If
1 knew who you are, if you are a
young man or a fat, bald-headed old
man, I might think of something you
would like to have, that I could send
you. I do hope that Santa wHI put
something nice and good in your
sock Christmas. I’m sure going to
hang up my stocking. I always get
lots of things, but I am not so very '
good. Santa always comes in Mis
souri. It is nearer the North Pole
than where you live; isn’t it? Mam
ma says she expects a big list of sub
scribers to this paper would please
you all right for an Xmas present.
I’ll send you as many as one, any
way.—lmogene Boyle, Centralia, Mo.
GIRLS IN THE MINORITY.
Dear Daddy-J-im:—Will you allow
me a little space in your Post-Card
Club? lam a little brown-eyed girl,
eleven years old. I have one sister
and nine brothers. I have one pet,
it is a big yellow cat and his name is
Sam. If I see my letter in print I
will come again. Goodbye, Daddy
Jim. —Marie Perdue, Route 1, Ala
mo, Ga.
SHE THINKS.
Dear Mr. Watson: —I am a little
girl twelve years old. lam going to
school now. My brother and I are
in the fifth grade. We have a large
school. Our teacher’s name is Miss
Jennie Miller. I love her very much.
Papa takes The Jeffersonian, and I
like to read the Post-Card Club very
much. My brother has a lot of post
cards you sent him. I will tell you
who I think is Daddy Jim: I think it
is Mr. Watson. —Mattie Floyd, Route
4, Lithonia, Ga.
AN ALABAMA INVITATION.
Will you let a little Alabama girl
join your Post-Card Club? I sure do
think there are no papers like the
dear old Jeffersonians. They are two
of the best that are published. lam
going to school at Langdale, Ala.,
and am in the eighth grade. Mr.
Watson, “Long may you live, to car
ry on good work like you are al
ready carrying on.” Father sure
’-es enjoy reading your fine papers.
He seems so disappointed when his
Jeffersonian doesn’t come. I think
you have discussed the Foreign Mis
sion work perfectly. I don’t believe
God intended for us to go to other
countries and leave our own neigh
bor’s children suffering for the want
of a few cents and clothes. Mr.
Watson, come down Xmas and eat
fine syrup and sausage with us, and
potatoes. We have killed two fine
bogs and have another to kill. I
hope to win an Xmas present, if it is
nothing more than a post-card from
our dear editor, Mr. Watson himself.
Wishing__you all a Merry Xmas and
a happy New Year, I am your new
friend. —Carrie Annie Walker, Lang
dale, Ala.

grade, and have eleven head marks,
i am expecting to win the prize. I
live six miles from town, on Route
No. 3. I have two kittens, named
Buff and Gold. My school-teacher’s
name is Mr. Rufus Price; he is a
good one. I think Mr. Tom Watson
is a fine man; if I was a man I would
ote for him. —Annie Price, Bartow,
Ga.
Cured His
Kidney and Bladder
Trouble At Home. At Small Cost. Will
Gladly Tell Any Sutterer How.
Mr. A. S. Hitchcock (Clothing Dealer), 970
Carrier Building, East Hampton, Conn., says
if any sufferer from a Kidney, Bladder or
Uric Acid Ailment will send him their address
he will, without any charge whatsoever, direct
them to the splendid and harmless remedy he
so successfully used at home in his own case.
We suggest it would be well to write him at
once, before letters get so numerous he be
comes unable to answer them all promptly.
The information he so freely gives has proven
of particular value to hundreds of suffering
people.
