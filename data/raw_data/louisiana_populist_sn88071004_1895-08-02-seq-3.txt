In this issule wVe anullltlnce d w
r. c'ndi l:r"y of I r. ('has. E. Trichel
for Sheriff of tlhis pari h on tthe
t Popilist ticket.
\ Mr. Trichel b\a I;,n 1 tal r.,:
in thiis piari-h anil i:s well an Ifa
voralily known to the majority of
'our pieople. lhe is a brother of the
)pr'esent Sheriff, Mr. (G. L. Trichel,
Sand servcd al hiis cief deputy for
eight iyear.'. atl two( years in the
:sane "loiition hitl Sheriff Ritus,
ri li hrot hers I ele' . :,te--'olr, .rive hint I
tell II'en iaexll'i.er in the office
to 'which he now ,lc:%piiecs.
His coils- in the office w-vs
marked with ability anuid devotion
to duty., and iiie 11ilu mhi nty3
friends.
oilnne two years ago Mr. Trichel
rt urned to the farni where he had
grown up. This he has followed
with that mieassure of suecess .()
realized by the average farmer.
which success(.) enableod him, as it
has the iajority of farmers to see
that the natural advantages of the
farm stand no show with the law
made( advantages of other profes
sions, and he soon joined the Peo
ple's party and did excellent work
for nMr. Bailey in the campaign
last fall.
Mir. Trichel hlas been strongly
solicited to make the he race lie now
enters, many of his Democratic
friends urging him to make the
race in that party, but being little
inclined to hypocrisy or deception, f
he refused all offers on a ticket
which he could not consciencionsly
support, and says he will rise or ,
fall with e People's party.
Mr. Trichel is forty-four years C
of age, and is a fine specimen of
physical manhood, possessed of
all the finer mental qualities that
lend strength to his character, and
we have no doubt that if elected -
he would make a sheriff -of whom
we would all be proud.
"Mr . A. B. Booth, denies that
he was ever informed of a call by W
any committee to call a ballot re
form convention at Alexandria ii
July 4th. Says he never heard of r
it.---People's Demands.
That is immaterial, entirely. Do
yoodeny it ? That is the pertinent ni
question. ol
You do, by. asking whether we, h
or Booth, had lied.
We care *but little who accuses ol
us of lying, so they don't prove it tl
Here is the proof in our favor
and against the unprincipled editor
of the Demands
On April 8th, at Wiunleld, La.,
there assembled a meeting of Pop
ulist. from Winn, Grant, Jackson cr
and Caidwel, and in said meeting
W.L. Shackelford, of Grat, was

i-g pssed a lengthy resolution of th
which the folowing is the vital

The entire resolution was unani
mously adopted, and the 5 delegates
to that meeting from Grant, vo
ting for this non-partisan scheme,
as the secretary's records show,
were in the meeting at Fairfield on
the 20th, and took a leading part
in condemning us and their own
record made only last Aprl.
Now, if the secretary of that
meeting at Winnfield did not fur
nish Mr. Booth a copy of that res
olution, he (the secretary) violated
his plain duty, but the Demands
cannot plead ignorance of this res
olution on account of the failure of
the secretary td do his duty, be
cause it published the whole pro
ceedings of that meeting with the
editor's full endorsement thereof.
Now who has lied, you dirty
coward.
We have heard that the Demo
crats did not like our speech to
the Campti Populist club July
20th.
This is strange, the People's
Demands says we have sold out to
the Dem's. and are helping them,
but they don't seem to appreciate.
How much abuse have you drawn
from the .Demoorats, Ed I None,
for you haven't fought them any.

NEW LYRK, July 23:, 1S5.
Ed. ILouisiana Populist :
Well, according to promise, I
write as to what I think will Ie
the outcome of the silver question.
I now say without any fear of he
ing called a false prophet, that
neither one of the old parties will
endorse a free silver plank. The
democrats are going to he as far
from it as the republicans. My
opinion is that the gold element, has
commenced the purchase act.
I find a great many persons that
say they were free silver men, but
now have changed their views. Af
ter leaving Ohio coming East, the
people depend almost entirely on
manufacturing, and that and read
ing nothing but gold papers, they
are solid for the gold standard. I
see no hopes for the free silver
dollar, except by a united West
and South. The manufacturers
here never look on the question as
affecting their business at all, and
the poor mechanic, I dont think
ever gets a chance to consider the
matter, for he gets nothing else to
read but gold literature. My
opinion is that in '96 the National
Populist ticket will roll up twice
as many votes as it has ever polled
before.
Respectfully,
