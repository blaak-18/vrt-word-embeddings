Death of Ernest Constantin.
mat Some nine months ago the writer
ry was invited to the home of Mr.
ng Ernest Cons:antin. A number of
friends and relatives had gathered
there to celebrate in a quiet, unos
tentatious way the 49th anniversary
of Mr. Constantin and to wish him
many more years on this earth.
Little did we think then that he had
d. reached the last mile-post of his
en earthly voyage and that we woulo
Y- be called upon to chronicle his
f- death before another twelve-month
ig had rolled by. Though apparently
)n enjoying good health and giving
c- every indication of a yet robust
of conststution, he was only a short
4- distance from that awful moment
when man must give up this life to
go to that undiscovered country.
M, Mr. Constantin was sick several
s- weeks before the end came, and dur
lp ing his sickness he expressed the
Y, opinion that his life would soon be
brought to a close. He seemed to
know that death was near, but he
f feared it not; he saw its approach
in and met it bravely and courageously.
e He died surrounded by a loving
LI wife and devoted relatives, who had
nursed him during his illness.
Ernest Constantin was born in
to this parish 49 years and 9 months
d ago, and his life was spent here
w with the exception of the time he
served in the Confederate army,
having been a member of Company
K., x8th, Louisiana Regiment.
te He was a good soldier and perform
* ed his duties during the war with
commendable devotion. After the
a war he lived some years on his
d farm in this parish and subse
t- quently moved to this town,
of where he remained in business
up to the time of his death.
He was a worthy member of Lodge
3294 Knights of Honor. He was
one of the first to join that society
L in Lafayette and he stood high in
the esteem of his brothers who at
tended his funeral in a body and
performed the last sad rites of the
order over his grave. He was a
member of General Frank Gardner
Camp of Confederate Veterans.
This association followed the re
mains to their last resting place.
His death will be sincerely regretted
d by many who enjoyed friendly rela
tions with him. He was a good
soldier, an honest man, and a useful
citizen.
His funeral Tuesday evening was
L. very largely attended.

t We are authentically informed

factory, would soon be here to make
the necessary arrangements to begin

Mrs. W. B. Meek, who resides at
, Camptonville, Cal., says her daugh
ter was for several years troubled at
times with severe cramps in the
stomach, and would be in such
agony that it was necessary to call
in a physician. Having read about
Chamberlain's Colic, Cholera and
Dlarrohoea Remedy she concluded
to try. She found that it always
gave prompt relief. It was seldom
necessary to give the second dose.
"It has not only saved us lots' of
worry and time," she says, "but al
so doctor bills. It is my opinion
that every family should have a bot
tle of this remedy in the house.'"

Dr. Rene Martin was in Lafayette
this week on a visit to his brother,
Dr. G. A. Martin. He had just re
turned from Crowley where he in
tends locating in the near future.
Dr. Martin graduated from the Hi
wassee College in Tennessee in 1878
and subsequently attended lectures
at the Tulane University. He has
practiced medicine in Breaux
Bridge for the last ten years with'
much success, having made a large
and lucrative clientele which he has
reluctantly decided to abandon to
open an office in Crowley which
place offers a wider field for the
practice of his profession. The
doctor is a very enterprising and
popular gentleman and skillfull phy
sician and we have no doubt that he
will be as successful in the future
as he has been in the past.

We have received this week from
r Mr. H. S. Kneedler, the author, a
very handsome book entitled.
f " Through . Storyland to Sunset
I Seas." It is an exceedingly well
gotten' up volume, written an an in
tertaining style and furnishes a large
I amount of information concerning
the country along the Southern Pa
I clfic road from New Orleans to the
Pacific Coast. The illustrations are
splendid, 'especially those repre
senting scenes on the Teche.
In Mr. Kneedler's own words:
'"The description takes you where
the roads lead-from the quaint his
totic city of New Orleans through i
the bayou region of Louisiana,
where summer lingers and poetry is
the hand-maiden of romance, across
the sugar and rice and cotton coun
try, into the cathedral aisles of the
vast pine forests. Then beyond,
where the great plains of Texas
reach to far-ott sky lines, through
quaint towns and cities, where for
eign speech and manners mingle
with our Anglo-Saxon civilization.
By the pillared Canon of the Rio
Grande the way leads, and past the
sepulchral cleft which the Pecos has
worn in the bosom of the earth. I
On farther yet are the dim blue
mountains and cacti-covered, tradi
tion-fraught plains of New Mexico
and Arizona; the sand-girdled Gila
and the implacable, mysterious Col
rado that steadfastly rolls to its
union with the California 3ulf.
Then comes the wonderland of the
Pacific Coast-the jeweled, flower- t
begirt valleys and snow-clad peaks
of California; the glint of azure
skies and sapphire seas; of vine-clad
hills and rose-embowered homes '
encircling groves of olive and of
orange. Up the great San Joaquin g
Valley you go, and down the coast
line, with many places of interest on
the way to claim attention. There
is a tour of San Francisco, with pen F
pictures of its points of interest; at
suggestion of the beauties to be seen t
on a run up the valley of the mad c
Sacramento; close skirting Shasta's f
rugged sides; the passage of the r
Siskiyous, down Rogue River Val- t
ley to Portland and the majestic I
Columbia. Then, too, the story
takes you eastward beyond the
Sierras, by Donner's Lake, the wild
Truckee River, the mysterious sink f
of the Humboldt, and to Ogden and i
Salt Lake City, lying close by the
Dead Sea of America."

Resolutions of Respect.
To the Officers and Members of Lafayette Lodge
No. 32"9, Knights of Honor:
The undersigned, your committee appoint
ed to draft a memorial on the death of our
brother, Ernest Constantin, which sad event
occurred on the isth inst., beg leave to sub
mit the following:
Ernest Constantin became a member of
our lodge in December, 1885, and by his
death a true and consistent Knight has been
called to his final account. Hlie connected
himself with the order when members here
were few and the lodge was struggling for
existence, and we, who have come after, tes
tify that he was one of those who proved his
faith by his works and thereby materially as
sisted in advancing the cause in this com
munity; therefore, be it
Resolved, That by the death of Ernest
Constantin Lafayette Lodge loses a worthy
member and the community a useful citizen.
Resolved, That in token of our regret for
the loss of our brother, that the members of
Lafayette Lodge Knights of Honor wear the
usual badge of mourning for the period of
thirty days and as a tribute to his memory,
that this report be spread upon the minutes, 3
and a copy duly transmitted to his family.
Resolved, further. That the Lafayette Ad- I'
vertiser and the Lafayette Gazette be re- C
quested to publish this report.
Respectfully submitted by the committee,
