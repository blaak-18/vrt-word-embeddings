ered the ground, and the wind hIowl- of tl
ed :around our camp, I left- my bivon- hisI
ac flee to attend the session of the
court. Winding for miles around1 StrI
uncertain paths, I at length arrived
at the court.ground at RtIoaid Oak
church. D:ay after day it had beet V
our duty to tr. the tilant .~dier ort
of te ilae offi 5iI r tatioin of if
of military law, but never hadl I on fore
any previous occasion been greeted date
by such anxious Spectators on that cess
morning awaiting the opening of the 'lThe
court. Ca:se after case was disposced ,ro
of, and at length the case of ''Trhe h:tv.
Confedlerate States vs. Edward Coop- ing
er" was called-charge, desertion. A desi
low Inlrmur rose spontaneously fromll ca(
the battle-scarrit d spectators, as a has
young artillerynlian rose from the panr
prisoners' bench, antd, in response to rott
the. question "Guilty or n0ot' guilty '" refti
answered, "Not guilty." wis
The Judge Advocate was proceed- for
- ing to open the prosecution, when fori
the court, observing that tile prison- goo
er was unattended by counsel, inter- our.
piosed, and inquired of the accused, alum
"Who is your counsel i" lie replied, bu,
"I have no counsel." Supposing that pro
it ws his purpose to represent ulnit- tuil
s self before thecout, the Judge Ad- ty t
vocate was instructed to proceed. ing
Every charge and specilieation against w*ll
the prisoner was sustained. T '1ei the,
prisoner was then told to introduce the
his witnesses. He replied, "I have rup
no witnesses," Astonished at the son
calmtess with which he seemed to be pet
submitting to what he regarded as in- '1
evitable fate, I said to him, "Hlave pa
you no defense 7 Is it possible that cei
you abandon your comrades and de- les
serted your colors in the presence of tio
the enemy without tny reason I" He sell
replied, "'lhere was at reason, but it vic
will not avail me before a military pal
court." I said: Perhaps you are prt
mistaken ; you are chargad with the til
highest crime known to military law, off
and it is your duty! to wnake known to'
the causes that infutione 'your ac- for
tions." For the first *tinie-his manly 8114
forn trembled, :nd his blue eyes ftti
swarm in tears. Approaching the frit
president of the court lihe presented a sui
letter, saying as he did so, "There, gal
General, is whettdid itW,t I opened
the iett . t ay, eyes t
one to another of the court until all tii
had seen it, and those stern warriors we
who had passed with Stonewall Jack- cli
son through a hundled battles wept an
like little chidren. Soon as I suali ha
ciently recovered lny self-possession, col
I read the letter, as the defense of the gi,
prisoner. It was in these words: wi
MIy Dear Eedcard: I have always mI
been proud of you, and since your
connection with the Confederate ar- go
my I have been prouder of you than rel
ever before. I would not have you co
do anything wrong for the world ; mT
1 but before God, Edward, unless you
come home we must die l Last night -
I was aroused .by little Eddie's crying t

ter, Eddie P" and he said: " Oh, p
-mamma, I'mlu so hungry !"' And Lucy, bn

ner and thinner every day. And Ibe- s
i fore God Edward, unless you come kI
home we,must died. tl

., Turning to the prisoner, I asked
'"What did Son do when you receivedl i
this letter I" He replied : "I made
application for furlough, and it was
rejected again I malde application D
and it was rejected; a third time I
mnde application, and it was rejected,
and that night as I wandered back
ward and forward in the etmp, think
ing of my hornme, with the mild eye of
Lucey looking up to me, and the burn
ing words of Mary sinking in my r
brain, I was to longer the Confede- v'
rate soldiert but I was the fiather of tl
Lucy and the husband of Mary, and
I would have passed those lines if
every gun in the battery had fired
opon me. I went to my home. Mary
ran out to meet me, her angel arms
embraced Itme, and she whispered,
"O, Edward, I am so happy, [ am
so glad you got your furlough I" She
mnust have felt me shudder, for she
turned pale as death, and castching C

here I am, gentlemen, not brought
llih er by military power, bat in obe
e to the command of Mary, to

Every oaher of that courthmartial
felt thie foe of the pridsoner's words.
Before them stood, in beatific vision,
the eloquent pleader for a husband's
and a father's wrongs; but they had
*. been trained by their great leader,
Rob. E. Lee, to tread the path of
duty, though, the lightning's flash

Cleaning Oilcloths.--Wash with
warm lwater; 150 deg. hot cracks thie
vani'rsih. S3)ap is neces:sary in smoky
districts, though it catn not be used
without dulling the colors soinewhat:
If a sponge is uis(d, examuine thor
otlghly for shells; thly scratch the
varnishl. The dlirthiluis removed, re:
vrwash the whole witii sweet milk and
water; then wipe dry. The milk
makes the surface smooth ; dirt does
not catch readily to it/; the oil in the
milki tentds to restore thie colors.-.
Gentle friction with an old silk hand
kerchiet will give a polish which
children delight to slip down upon.

ground cloves; cisuamuon, allsy t.ie
Aind I inltmeg; then +!2 cups flour;
last of all 2 cups chopped raisins,
Bake in a slow oven, and you will
have an excellent cake, and one that
will lanst through hot weather. And
here allow me to tell yo, if raisins
.are put in a cake the last thing, and
stirred only just eonough to mix, your
l raisins will niot fall to the bottom of
the cake. Use the above recipe-
olumitting the milk-dissolve soda idi
little hot water, and you will have
very nice cookies.
