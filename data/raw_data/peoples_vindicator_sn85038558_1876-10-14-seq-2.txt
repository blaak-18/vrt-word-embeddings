One of those shinntg lights of local
a radicaism was almost on his knees
is after the Packard meeting to get
som sens respectable gentleman to drink
with him ; "Just a thimblefall," said
j he. Of course this pleasure was do*
clined, and wha oear radical rascal
r: was pressing in his demand for cease,
be ewas plaily told "that gentlemen
in iadulged io gecial drinks only with
gentlemen."
This three handred dollar thief to
whom we allude spoke very feeliagly
of ostracism and all that; talked of
masonry, for two of the gentlemen to
whom he spoke were masons, but he
was promptly quoelshed oe that score

All this goes to show dust defeat is

gSo far, we have no comnplaint to an
make of Mr. Ruass, Supervisor of Ileg- mn

orders which we thuink should have on
been disobeyed; however, he candidly I
admits the facet, that he does so under isie
instructions, and this admuission in a do
measure, mitigates the sin.
As we said, we have no complaint en
to make, so far, of Mr. Russ, personal ye
ly, but we propose to tear his figures nil
to tatters. the
The registtntion office in New Or. an
leais has instructed Russ to rase his
report of tile white and c1.d reg. ho

turn in that office of
Whites registered in 1874. s

to this is added the white and black er,

shows a negro majority of 1250 in We
Natchitoches parish. de
Every man with one grain of sense St,
in this State knowes full well what MI
that means. It is in fact the thinnest CO
of their tricks, to furnish a basis for
the Retourning Board. 1250 Is, how. Pi
ever, a bed number. It has been B'
tried before with 1250. Myers and As
Breda, in 187, hasd a 1250 election, to
with affidavits and no votes. The
slop organ on Pront Street, has talk
ed 1250 majority until thie fabric is
worn out, and every Democratic citi- 01
sen Is on the watch for them. Now pr
we will give the realflgutres of 1874, (*
which show a marked difference from fo
Mr. Rus's instructions, and ours are bi
from the Registrar himself.
The white registered vote in 1874,
was l356, colored 2351--colored me

Be that asit may, we take the 2351

the census of 1870.
