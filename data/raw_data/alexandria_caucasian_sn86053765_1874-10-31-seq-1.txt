ITïP Ono of tho greatest crimes
known in military law, and which is
always punished with tho utmost
severity is "cowardice in the face
of tho enemy." Kellogg commit
ted this offenso o'i tho 14th of Sep
tember last, when as commander
and chief of tho navies and armies
ot Louisiana ho dodged into tho
Custom House and claimed ho was
out of tho State. • Let him be court
martialed and shot !—La. State
Register.
IIP Kellogg takes to Iiis adminis
tration and himself great credit lor
reducing taxation from twenty-one
and a half mills, to fourteen and a
half mills. IIo dont tell how this
reform was brought about, by repu
diating forty per cent of the State
debt. Wo don't find any evidence
of great financial ability or states
manship, in this transaction, and in
truth we don't see much honesty,
either in the repudiation, or in Kel
logg claiming credit for reducing
taxation.-(La. SUntc Kesrister.
THE WHITE MAJORITY.
The New Orleans Republican , of
October 20tU, 1874, gives some fig
ures regarding the relative strength
of the political parties in this State,
and says, the caso then stands
thus :
Colored ci tizons over'21 80,444
Whito citizens over 21 64,816
Total voters by tho census.... 145,260.
Now let us turn to tho registra
tion records of 18(iS, tho first com
plete registration since tho wor.
What do wo find f Ono hundred
and forty-six thousand thrco hun
dred and ninety-eight were regis
tered. This wo8 two years before
tho ccnsns, and does not show a
very great discrepancy from tho
census figures. There wero regis
tered in 1870, 153,300. This was
some monts after tho taking of the
censns. Wo do not take cogni
zance of the frauds alleged by both
sides to have been committed, for
wo do not think it materially
changed the result.
Tho vote of tho State of Louisi
ana in 1808 as officially recorded
was eighty thousand two hundred
and twenty-tivo («80,225) for Sey
mour and Blair. No sano man can
pretend that a virulent Republi
can administration, such as wo bad
in 1808, allowed the Demociats
moro votes than they really cast.
Now, taking the census and the
ofiicial journal of the Bepublican
party as a guide, wo find tho
strength of tho political parties to
be as follows:
Democratic (voto of 1868) 80.224
Republican 65,035
Total voters by the census 145,260.
Assuming the figures of tho He
publican to bo correct, tho Demo
cratic party of this State have a
clear majority of fifteen thousand
votes.

—The Spider. —This is a inseck
that cetclies Hies in a net like a fish
net, but not in the water. Tho net
is called a web, and wen it cetches
dust insted of Hies it is a cobweb.
Tho spider knocs ho is ugly, so ho
stays a good deal to homo, but ug
ly wiinmeu goes to church and
walks in the .street more than pret
ty ; but they aro both in the same
business, which is trappin'.
In Calitorny they has spiders
that scorns to spin webs, but goes
out and cetches game like other
beasts ot pray. They aro about tho
size of a girl baby, and a lot pi /.eu
er. These is tar antulers. Wen a
Tnjin hos bit liisself with a tar an
tuler he fils his skin with wisky
and steals a blanket to rap hisself
in, and hunts a place ware his bo
dy will be most in tho way. Then
lie lies down, and if tho pizen don't
work all to once ho sings the deth
song of tho bravo, and that nocks
him. We was tolo this to our
house by a traveler who said he
guessed he knew a tarnal site
about Injins and tar antulers
though ho hadn't never been to col
lege. But Uncle Ned he says it is
best to git a good edducation first,
anil then thro' in Injins and tar an
tulers accordin' to taste.
Spiders isn't sociblo 'ccptin'
among there own set. My sister's

ed, and wastes a lot of time in such
frivolous amewsmcnt as countin'
the bolt beds in there dores.
