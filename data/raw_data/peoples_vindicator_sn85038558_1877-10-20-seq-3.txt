ig tare delivered last Thursday night on
the subject of the
8 bbath.
The wotd Sabbath signides rest.-
;" God hsaing created the world and all
of that is therein in six days, rested on
lh the seventh, and set it apart in a pe
culiar manner for his worship; thus
we see the Sabbatb originated at the
birth of creation when none but that
k- happy pair existed on the face of the
earth.
We see the observance of this day
tn again etfforced amid the fire and amoke
and thunderings and earthquake at 1
Mount Sinai, written out by Divine
figores on tables of stone.
n- Jeasus Christ our Saviour, and who
in was God incarnate, said to his disci- 1
ples, "Go ye therefore and teach all
be nations * * * teaching
c- them to obserre all things whatsoever
I Iiar commanded you, and ho I am
with you alway even unto the end of in
the world." The apostles under this u-li
and other directions, went foirth im- wi
mediately after the conferring of the to
Ioly Ghost on the day of Penticost, shi
and taught the multituldes by exam -
pie and otherwise to observe the first sh:
(lday f the week in com nimcneoration of :1
the resurrection of Christ, and thus iG
while the christian S~abath still eo'u
meillorlt'lts thel great worlk of creation
according to the origiial appointment;
by a change from the sevenithl to the
first day of the week : it also corn
nletnorates the resurrection of our
lonl illtd ,Saviour Jesus ChIrist.
When we realize that Christ is God
and that the old and the new testa
llent ate e'qually itlspirted and wl ittoll
by the, satte, Divine Authority, ;aid
the folly of observiung two IHoly days
in the wreek ; then we are prepared toi
COmplrehend the virtue of observing tii
the first of the week as a day of rest. ti
Let ts consider our subject under the it
followiai h ,'tea --vii : "
Is--Law f;ivell,
2nd--Its Strictness,
3d'(l - Helasoll.,
4th--Sabbath Breaking.
1st. Law Given. t
Exodus 20-8 to 11. tot
Remembner the Sabbath day and tll
keep it IHoly, six days shalt thou 1; h1a
bar and do all thy wnork, but Ithe se.- oi,
enth day is the Sabbath of the Lord thi
thy God, in it thou shalt not do ally 1
work, tlihou, nor thy soil, nor' thy
dalightter, thy imall servanit nor thi iv
maid servai(nt, nor thy cattle, nor thy tih
stranllgers that is within thy gates: pli
For in six days the Lord iiado lear- I
en and Earth, the Sea and all that in of
them is, and rested the seventh day, it
therefore the Lord blessed the Sab- I'h
bath dly and hallowed it.
COMMtNT :- Judging men by their i
actions we would readily conclude .lt
that, they do not consider this corni
mandlment as bindling as those which I .'
say '"Thou shalt not kill." "Thou his
shalt not steal," and yet they were tISl
given at the same time, by the same n
.Jehovah, and for our olbservance. It w
seems that God well understood that
reckless sinful man would knowingly
violate this law rind as it is a cou- i
matidment of such great importance, an
it commences with, "Remember, when 1t;
about to violate this law by buying, Iii'
or selling, or amusing oursalves on us,
the Lords Holy Sabbath, let us reflect tlt
pause-Remnentber that we are makinga i
up an awful record for Eternity. 1 rl
2,. Its Strictness. ei
Exodus 35-2.
Six days shall work be done, but on
the seventh (lay there shall be to you sits
an Holy Sabbath day, a ,abb:ath of i
rest to the Lord, whosoever doceth tr
work therein shall be put to death. so,
Exodus 34-21. to
Six days shalt thou work, but on the ,a
seventh day thou shalt rest, in earing ow
time and in harvest thou shalt rest. tr:
Nehemiah 10-31. il
And if the people of the Lord bring 1,
ware or any victuals on the Sabbath st,
day to sell, that we would not bay it wl
of them on the Sabbath, or on the
Holy day.
CoiMENTsr:-This seems to have
been in the nature of a resolution,
showing that they would not sell on
the Sabbath day, ucither would they
encourage the violation of the Sab
bath by buying on that day, no, not
virtuals ulder thie pretense of necee,- *
sity'
3rd, Reason for Klieeping the Sabbath.
Exodus, 20-.11.
For in s~ days the Lord made I.
lleavcn anid E:Lrth, the Sea, and all
that in tihemni is, and rested the sev
enthi day; wherefore the Lord Iless
ed the Sabbathlt day and hallowed it.
Ezekiel, 20-12 & 13.
' * * and my Sabbath's they great
ly polluted; then I saidtl I wolldI poui
out ly fury uipon them in the wilder
ness, to consume them.
4th, Sabbath Breaking,
Exodus, 31-15.
Six days shall winok be done, but in
the seventh is the Sablbath of rest
Holy to the Lord, vhlosoever dothl
-any work loi the Sabbath day shall st
surely be put to death.
r COMME:(T:--This law is simply
susplnded because we hIave ueither
State or ecclesiastical Courts possess
ing power to entorce the same, but '
let us not forget that a moro awful 5
Spenalty than this will be enforced,
Sthait is, the deathli of the soul, its eter- u
nal banislinment fr'omi God for viola
0tiug his positive law.
Neheminiah, 13-20 & 21.
SSo thie merchants and sellers of all g
. kinds of ware lodged witiot Jernsa- t
1em once or twice. Then I testified
against thim, and said unto them,
0why lodge ye against the wall? If
- ye do so again I will lay lhanids onl
yOc. From that time forth they came
no more on the Sabbath.
It is observable that the merchants u
who were so bout on accumulating a
fortune, and went so fir as to violate a
tthe Sabbath day, which their God A
fhad sanctified and set apart for rest i
and worship, found that their greed '
Sfor gain .would not be tolerated. The
-otlicers of the law were about to con
Sfiscate their goods and east them in
e prison, and so fixed was this deter
mination that thie "merchants and d
-sellers of Ware," left the walls of
Jerusalem after the first or second
effort.
Should a small company of those 1
grand old Jewishl ofieers of the palmy A
edays of Jerusalems, pass through oar
beloved Louisiana next Sabbath, ac
companied with a distroying angel,
many a Sabbath breaker would fall
is under the keen edge of their sword.
d God says, "Reemember the SabbatA
day," not a part of the Sabbath, not
merely during the hours of worship,
but the whole day.
n What would a city gentleman say
of a farmer if he should see him
chopping timber, mauling rails, or
plowing on the Sabbath day? He
would venture to lecture him on the
II subject, and yet perhaps at the same
Stimei' bl ofice or store is wide open
and business carried on, on a large
scale. The result is our Catholic and
e Protestant Churches are emptyon the
SSabbath, and both must call for for.
e ign assistance to maintain a Chris
tian organization.
, Look at Louisiana, the Eden of
e Amnerica-the'laud of flowers, and of
t beauty-with her fertile soil and
Ssalubrious climate, broad enough,
rich enough for an Empire to sleep in.
SLook at our native Louisiana without
her Sabbath's, and weep; look at her
debt of millions and weep, look at her
Sblasted efforts to induce immigmration,
Sand weep, No man desires to leave
Sa State whore God's wIley day is held
in high regard: , and1 g to to a State
where thisi day is desecrated, and
where hisi childiren will be raised up
to disregard this day of rest and w'or
ship.
G(ive ma our Sabbath tlay's, and we
shall have 1,osp,'rity, happiness, andl
: people' noted for' their piety and
(G; rdlnine's.
