AN ADDRESS TO THE ROSS
Holv the Coming Tien of America May Become Knights.
By U R. BROOKS.
My Dear Boys: When I see a
manly, hard-working boy, I feel like
saying to him, “How are you, Sir
Knight?” A knight is a common sol
dier, to be true and brave all through
life. An idle boy can not be true and
brave so long as he is idle. All true
knights are brave. There is not much
darkness about a good knight. You
boys have heard, perhaps, about the
Knights of Honor, Knights of Pythias,
Knights of the Road, Knights Tem
plar, etc. While looking over a good
book the other night, 1 read of the
Knights of Malta, or of St John of
Jerusalem, who were originally called
Knights of Hospitallers, instituted
by certain merchants of Amalphi, in
the kingdom of Naples, who, trading
in the Levant, obtained leave of the
caliph of the Saracens to build a house
at Jerusalem for themselves and pil
grims, on paying an annual tribute.
Soon after they founded a church in
honor of St. John the Baptist, with
a hospital for sick pilgrims, from
which they took their name.
The valiant and most pious Prince
Godfrey of Bouillon, who took Jeru
salem in 1099, exceedingly favored
the hospitallers, who, in the sign of
Baldwin I, king of Jerusalem, 1104,
added to their religious vows another,
by which they obliged themselves to
defend the pilgrims in the Holy Land
from insults of the Saracens. From
that time they became a military or
der of knights, their badge being a
cross with eight points. In 1187, Sal
adin, the caliph of Syria and Egypt,
wrested Jerusalem for the last time
from the Christians, after the king
dom of the Latins had maintained it
self there 89 years, under eight kings.
The knights retired to Aeon, on the
seacoast of Palestine, till that strong
fortress was taken by storm by the
Saracens in 1291, from which time
they resided in Cyprus till, in 1310,
they took Rhodes from the infidels
and the year following defended it
against their furious assaults, being
relieved by the seasonable succor
brought by the brave Amedens IV,
Count of Savoy. The Turks having
vanquished the Saracens and embrac
ed their superstition, and Muhammad
II having taken Constantinople by
storm in 1453, under Constantine
Paleologus, the last Grecian emperor,
these knights became more than «ver
the bulwark of Christendom. Under
the conduct of the valiant grand mas
ter, Aubusson, in 1480, they bravely
defended their isle for two months
against the victorious army of above
100,000 men of Muhammad 11. the
greatest warrior of all the Kurkish
emperors, who conquered the empires
of Constantinople and Trebizand, 12
kingdoms and 200 cities. The em
peror, Charles V, gave to the knights
the Isle of Malta in 1530. Soleyman
11, in 1566, bent the whole strength
of his empire against this small is
land, but after a siege of four
months his army was shamefully re
pulsed by the most memorable defense
that is recorded in history. The
Turks retreated with 80,000 men
when the Knights of Malta had only
6,000 men. Raymund du Puy was
the first grand master after they be
came knights. He drew up the stat
utes of the order and died in 1160.
The Knights Templar were instituted
by seven gentlemen of Jerusalem in
1118 to defend the holy places and
pilgrims from the insults of the Sara
cens, and keep the passes free for
such as undertook the voyage of the
Holy Land. They took their name
from the first house which was given
them by King Baldwin 11, situated
near the place where anciently the
temple of Solomon stood. The Teu
tonic Knights owe their establish
ment to certain German gentlemen
from Bremen and Lubec at the siege
of Aeon in Palestine. The Teutonic
Knights conquered, in 1250, the in
fidels of Prussia.
Now, boys, these were true knights
-—true to God and to their country —
true men and true soldiers of the
cross. Remember that true boys gen
erally make good men.
“Childhood shows the man
As morning shows the day.”
You will soon be the rulers of this,
the greatest country in the world,
and allow me to suggest that you take
good men as your models and try to
follow in their footsteps—such men
as General R. E. Lee and Stonewall
Jackson. General Lee, long before
the war of secession, emancipated his
slaves. General Grant, like a great
many southern people, did not free his
slaves until the war was over.
I am told that General Jackson
never went into battle without first
fervently praying to almighty God
the God of Battle, to direct him, which
accounts for his many victories. When
I was a boy, clad in my gray confed
erate jacket, I had to carry a dis
patch from Generals Hampton and
Butler at Belfield, Ga., in December,
1864, to General Lee at Petersburg, a
distance of fifty miles, and I will
never forget the impression that was
made on my mind when I reached Pe
tersburg that cold, bleak Sunday morn
ing. General Lee was not at his
head quarters, where I had expected
to find him, but was in church, where
I found and handed him this impor
tant paper. I have often thought >f

this, the grandest soldier of the 19th
century, standing in the pew, clad in
his gray uniform, looking as humble
as the smallest child in the church.
Now, boys, remember that there
is no tragedy like a wasted life. If I
could get the ear of every young man
for but one suggestion, it would be
this: Make the most and best of
yourself.
Jefferson Davis says: “Strive to
leave, when life on earth is ended,
that good name which virtue only will
command.” Boys, here are some fa
miliar quotations that may be of use
to you in after years.
“The good need fear no law,
It is his safety, and the bad man’s
awe.”
“Revenge i§ a naked sword,
It has neither hilt nor guard,
And, instead of the heart of the foe,
Thou mayest find it sheathed in thine
own.”
“Live innocently; God is present.”
“In judging others, man labors in
vain, often errs and easily sins; but
in judging and looking into himself,
he always labors with fruit.”
“I have often heard that it is safer
to hear and take counsel than to
give.”
“What the superior man seeks is in
himself; what the small man seeks is
is in others.”
“A kind-worded man Is a genial
man, and geniality is power.”
“Discretion in speech is more than
eloquence.”
“To serve God is to reign.”
“The right thing is never to talk
about self at all.”
“The word character comes from
a term which means to engrave upon
or to cut in. Character is that inner,
substantial and essential quality which
is wrought into the very soul, and
makes a man what he really is. Char
acter is also a perfectly educated
will.”
Never allow your ambition to get
ahead of your judgment, for fear, like
Davy Crockett, you may say, “He who
