By DADDY JIM
BELIEVES IN EDUCATION.
Papa takes the Jeffersonians and
sure reads them, too. He thinks Mr.
Watson is the greatest man in the
United States. I also am inclined to
think the same. I can compare Mr.
Watson with Davis, Lee, Jacksonj
Jefferson, Washington, and all the
other great men who have lived and
died. I heard Mr. Watson speak at
Idylwild last September, and sure
listened with care, as 1 was in the
audience of a great statesman and
patriot. I am a believer in having
an education, for it is something
that no one can take away from you.
My age is 15 years.—Thos. H. Joiner,
Tennille, Ga.
GIRLS HAVE THE BEST OF IT.
The girls do not have to work in
the field. They can stay in the house
and fix up for Sunday. Then they
dress up and fix their hair and
primp. Then they are ready for their
fellows, and when they come, they
get in the buggy and go for a ride. —
Alonzo Watson Rape, aged 13, Mc-
Donough, Ga.
WHAT WOULD WE DO?
What would we do if it were not
for the boys? They are rude and
noisy, but that is natural with a boy.
I have one brother, and I don’t think
we could do anything without broth
er. Our president and governor were
once boys. The boys are the hope of
our country. A boy will be good and
kind if you treat him nicely. I hope
my brother will make a grand and
noble man some day, and all the rest
of the boys.—Maggie Novella Bur
ton, Armuchee, Ga., 10 years old.
A LITTLE ALABAMA BOY.
I am eleven years old. I go to
school in Talladega, Ala., and am in
the fourth grade. Miss Oliver is my
teacher, and I like her very well.
There are thirty-two pupils in my
grade. My papa takes your paper.
He said that you were one of his
great friends. I like to read the let
ters that are in your paper from
Alabama and Georgia. We are going
to have a tournament at Talladega,
and we would like to have Mr. Wat
son down there to see it. I write
with my left hand.—Will Ed Mullen,
Barclay, Ala.
GIRLS’ WORK.
I am 15 years old. I think girls
are very nice. I know when they
come back from college they don’t
want to work, and they ought not to
have to, for a girl was made to keep
house, teach school, clerk and keep
books, or such work as will let them
stay in the house. —Reginald Max
well, Resaca, N. C.
FROM THE OCHLOCKNEE.
I live in Thomas County, a mile
from the big Ochlocknee River. Igo
fishing very often and catch fish. I
have six brothers and four sisters.
The oldest of my brothers is teach
ing school, and three of my sisters.
One of my brothers is in Fort Adams,
R. I. He has joined the army.—Al
bert Heald, Thomasville, Ga., 9 years
old.
'S&ffftrsonian
We have received a bushel of let
ters from our young friends, telling
us what they hope to be, and many of
them are manly or womanly, good,
sensible letters. We cannot print all
of them this week. We will print as
many as we have room for, and next
week we will award the prizes.
WANTS TO BE A FARMER.
I want to be a farmer and always
be strong and healthy, and have
many friends, and always have a
plenty. I want to live an honest life
and have a happy home. I am 14
years old. —Kennedy Sellers, R. F. D.
1, Geneva, Ala.
WANTS TO LIVE OUTDOORS.
I want above all things to be a
botanist, and to live outdoors among
the wild birds and flowers, in the
woods; and to know all about na
ture, how birds build their nests,
how plants grow, how old the trees
are, and the different names of birds
and their sweet songs; and all snakes,
the poisonous kind and their names;
lizards, toads, fish, eels, dogs and
animals of all kinds.—Leila Lackey,
13 years old, Bodga, Miss.
FOND OF HORSES.
I hope to be a livery-stable man,
because I am very fond of riding
horses now. I like to play some, and
to work some. I do not want to
play all the time. When I get grown,
the thing I want to do is to let whis
key alone. If I don’t, I will not be
anything but a drunkard. —J. W.
Bankston, 11 years old, Barnesville,
Ga.
HOPES TO BE A MAN.
I hope to be a man, —a good, kind,
and noble man. I hope to be a man
who will not hesitate to uplift a fel
low citizen, for Jeffersonian
Democracy, and vote the Populist
ticket. I hope to be a citizen who
will help in the upbuilding of his
town, county, state and country.—
Harper Cole, Jr., 12 years old, Roa
noke, Ala.
HE WANTS THE EARTH.
I hope to be a wealthy farmer, and
own an automobile, fine horses, hogs,
cows, sheep, goats, chickens, guineas,
turkeys, geese; and raise cotton, corn,
tobacco, watermelons, cane, peanuts,
potatoes, grapes, apples, pears, plums,
peaches and figs. I hope to own
rich‘ground, good water, and have
good health, a barn and stables, a fine
house with fine furniture, and have
good neighbors; and, should I ever
be fortunate enough to marry, get a
good wife. —Thomas E. Huggins, 12
years old, Hartsfield, Ga.
WILL BE A NEWSPAPER MAN.
In life there are many positions.
I hope to be what I am best suited
for and can do the best credit for
myself and others. I will be a news
paper man, if I am able to do
the work with satisfaction. I intend
to be in an honest business, even if
it be an humble and poor job. Do
as I am going to do, and your life
will be a success.—Parker W. Camp
bell, 14 years old, Scottsboro, Ala.
