RAILROAD PASSES.
The Legislature of New York has
passed a law compelling railroads
to transport public officers free of
charge. This appears to have been
done to remove from the railroads
this most dangerous means by which
public servants are bribed. Rather
than make the issuance of passes to
officers compulsory on the part of
railroads, we believe a laws hould be
enacted prohibiting the railroads
from issuing them to gAtlemen
helditg judicial and legislative of
fices.
Anyone who has observed the
thirn of aflairs in our own State will
age~e with us that the enforcement
of surdh a: law is one of the things
absolutely needed. We do not be
nieve that the honest judge or the
donegientious- legislator will be in
dluenced by a pass, but a man hold
..~_g* -i* r of these officers of trust

Sacctrse the coult of partiality whef
t~ie case is decided contrary to his
'.i'nterest. Being ignorant of the law
'and unable to grasp its many intri

4p.xh its sincerity. And when he
