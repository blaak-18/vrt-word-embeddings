now can plants aierease the fertility
of the soil? In tw ways. One by add
ing to it that part tlemselves which
they obtain from the air, and the oth
er by searching many feet into the
ground with their roots and bringing
to the surface the chemicals and fer
tilizing materials stored there, and
filtered from the surface for ages.
This is lucerne's method of benefit
Ing the soil. This letter, from a urac
tical farmer, so completely explains
and answers every point and question,
that we feel we can not add to it.
"In September, 1894. I wrote a short
article about lucerne. I havereceived
letters concerning it from all parts of
the conhtry, and at the request of my
friends all over the Union, I will talk
a little more about lucerne, its habits,
uses and culture. Lucerne will grow
on any land that will produce wheat,
corn or potatoes, and will thrive on
many" lands that none of these will
grow on, especially very light sand or
gravel, though it does well on clay.
But it will not grow on any land that
the water stands within one foot of
the surface, and there is no use in sow
ing it in an alkali that is strong enough
to keep wheat from growving.
Though particular about wet land,
it will stand any amount of
wet in the summer, as long as there is
plenty of drainage. It will also stand
all the water in the winter that may
fall in the shape of rain, or snow that
may melt. It is a very quick grower'
and will mature the first crop in about
two months from the time that growth
commences. The second crop will me
ture in about six weeks from euttitng,
and the third in about five weeks from
cutting of the second. The senond
crop is the heaviest, but the first is it
little the best feed, as it grows a little
longer than the others. It will
yield about on an average of slx tu*ds
per acre. and I have known it to pro
duce double that quantity. It is a

'"Cultivation.-WVh~t~j there is plenty
of rain there is no cultivation needed,
for it would be unwise to mantre it,
as it thrives fully as wC·a- on washed
sand as will on the best garden
spot, but in a few years it will
make clear sand a rich land, ow
ing to the decay of the root. The
roots will sink themselves for a dis
tance of ten to twenty feet straight
down. They are about one and a half
inches in diameter, and fully one-half
of that root decays every ycit fonrd the
outside, antd Ieeps growing larger
from the center every year.
"It should be cut when in full bloom.
A little old is better than too young;
when the bloom is ready to fall off is
not too late. Do not out too much it
once, for if you allows rain to dome on
your hay after it Is cut, it will iiot be
worth more than One-ht]l fo *

less for tnmrket. Heavy dews

windrows it cut with a mowing ma
chine, acnd let dry until it begins to
tut the leaves fall when handled
roughly, then pick it up and lay it in
piles, just one fork full in a pile to
cure. Do not roll it together or it
will not load easily, then ytiit Will
have to pull it to piedes thus losing
one-half of the leaves. By following
In.V aliections you can put each on
perfectly clean at one fork-full, and
not waste time nor any of the leaves.
But right here let m- warn you
against condemning it as a worthless
lot of sticks until you try your horses
and cows, and see them cleadt tip the
sticks before they do the leaves. There
are not many animals that take
to it when dry, without having it in
their manger for a few days withl oth
er hay; but in a few days you will see
the grass hay left while the lucerne is
cleaned up. A ton of uIncerne will not
go quite ans far as a ton of timothy. Do
not let hungry cattle get on it While
green, especially whecn wet, for it will
bloat them, which is apt to result in
death. IC you wish to pasture it, first
feed your stock all they can and will
eat, then turn them on the green lu
cerne, and no harm will come to them.

Rcrep Farm Rerords.
Every farmer is to a great extent a
manufacturer, and ought to keep a
record of hIs operations. -This is the
key to sucess in any business. But
the soiltiller should attend to some
other matters in connection with his
accour.ts. A nmap of his farm, with
each :ield numbered, and its size, qual
ity Lf soil, etc., specified, will be a
great aid in keeping track of the
year's transactions. How many farm
ers have such a guide and copvenience?
And how many kIept such memoranda
the past year as will enable them
to tell the expense of each crop grown.
And how ab t the domestic animals?
If you kee~ mws what have they paid
you per head in the aggregate? And
what of sheep, swine, and even the
chiclcens? How much did eachi contrib
ute to your income, and which waas the
most profitable?
Those who can answer those perti
nent questions must be well advised in
regard to their financial position, and
need no admonition, but we fear many
are utterly nnable to give any detailed
account of their farming opera
tions, or whether the balance is

The intense drougth has quite ge
erally destroyed the spring seeding
grass and elover. Unless a "catch" of
grass is secured ahis season, the crop
rotation will be thrown out of Joint
the supply of- hay and pasttur, ne a
year out short., and soil fertility may
be lost through leaving the ground
bare.
The following suggestions are made
in the fall belief that under average
weather conditions a "'fall catch" of
clover and grass may be secured.
1. Burn the stubble to destroy all
rubbish that would interfere with the
perfect preparation of the seed bed.
2. Harrow repeatedly, with a disk or
spading harrow, until the soil is thoer
oughly loosened to the depth of two or
three inches.
8. Pulverise the soil very finely with
a fine tooth harrow.
4. As soon as the soil becomes thor=
oughly moistened, now the clover seed,
harrow Uin lightly, and heavily roll
the ground.
The timothy or other grass seed may
be sown later, say about the tsua
time of sowing wheat.

The wreeg Time of Year.
Last spring a year ago I was off down
in the Flat Woods and saw i'elit Mayo

whilst in the settlement I rodb by to
see Dandy: He was ,right tolerable
high untd death whSn I Rot there: Thi
foitders hnd already give him up as a
a gone goslin and went on home. But
the family and the neighbors were
standin around the death bed cryin and
takin on till it was a sad sight to see.
Dandy lowed it was the wrong time
of year for him to did'&iid lid want
ready: He tihad out like he want a
blami1d bit skeered, bu itat the same
time he said it thei-e *its an. i ay ti
back dtwtn, or snake out and dodge the
question he would love to do it. But
the laughin part came when Dandy put
in to beggin his wife to take his place
and go on ahead.
"You are the best and most purest
human person f Hitke efdi Ea f; ,ld;8'
says Dandy to his wife, which she was
Mliss blatildy Lucas before she took
and married him. "You never did cuss
and drink whisky and bet on cards

You are ready to die, Tildy, whilst I

I wish you would take my place so I
would have more time to quit my

What tmade it so particular funny to

he called her, had been takin his place
for years and years. Dandy want worth
his room in this world to start with,
and his good wife had took his place
hll along the line. She was jest
kimply the rinaidest ifiati in the family.
(he tbok Dandy's place #nd i-itO thiei
little farm, and fed the stocdk asid
chopped the wood, and kept the fenses
up in general. lnut the time had
now come when Tildy couldn't neither
wear the breeches nor stand in his shoes,
and so he had to face the music single
handed and alone. She was willin and
tnore than tbillin, you understand, but
the couldn't play his hand oiit for hirm
in that game. Danidy had got tiiligs
inighty bad mixed and muddled up
ianyhotw. It was his time of year to die.
It maybe looked to him like the wrong
time,but in the general plans of creatioii
it was the right time, and so there he
was. At any rates, the general situa
tion hit me all in a wad in a funny
place, and I had to go out on the back
tvrch and laugh it off.

Dandy Mayo in regards to one thing
he want to say fitten and he want

rough and rocky road, you understand,
but he had went all the gaits clean
down to the finish. And then finally
at last when the doctor gite ouit the
news that human help couldn't -do no

old man Ebenezer looked up mighty
serious like and sober and then went
on to say:
"From the way you talk, doctor, this
must be a ease of great pushency, and
I reckol it ain't for me to say whether
I should or whether i shouldn't. Ulit

Elbow Room in Death.
.Te SNick Stringer was about the most
stirrin man that was ever turned out
from the Rocky Creek settlement in
his day and time. He went off to the
city before he was good grown, and
presently he got to be a lawyer and a
banker, superintendent of a Sunday
school and a standin candidate for con
gress all at the same time.
ut in the regular run of things the
bottom fell out with Joe Nick, you un
derstand, and his general machinery
run down and stopped. He had return
ed back home to die, and when the last
day come he sent for me to drop over and
see him. By that time Joe Nick was so
terrible poor and pale and thin till it took
two or three people to see him, though
he told me himself that more than
oncet he had helt such full hands till
nobody couldn't see him.
"I jest only wanted to shake the partin

in the Roeky Creek country, and when

everybody knows, Andy Lucas is some

Bartlet had went ti rshool tegther,

And when Tony had let loose and went

was down flat on his back-helpless

call him "friend"-and that one man

So when Tony come to die Andy Wat/t
