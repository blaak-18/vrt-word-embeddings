Dr. Prime has a sharp-nib
bed pen, which he sometimes uses
effectively in the columns of the
Observer. For example: "On the
beach where was the port of An
tioch, where the Disciples were
first called Christians, the steamer
in which we were journeying made
a landing. There was no town ;
no wharf; no people ; the merchan
dise and passengers were put as
hore in a lighter which ran np into
the sand. A troop of camels with
their drivers lay on the beach to
transport the goods into the inte
rior. The chief article landed was
in several barrels marked distinct
ly 'Boston Rum.' These barrels
were to be hoisted upon the backs
ol the camels and taken toAntioch!
We sat upon a barrels and mused
upon the progress of Christianity
and civillization."— [Danbnry Neics.

of the Rapides Agricultural Fair

How the Ancients Spent Their Money.
Who among our extravagant
young ladies in these boastful times
ever gave her lover, as Cleopatra
did, a pearl dissolved in vinegar (or
undesolved) worth $400,000 ? Then
there was Paulina, one of the ton
in Rome, wlio used to wear jewels
when she returned her visits,
worth $300,000. Cicero, who was
comparatively a poor man in those
times, gave $1,500,000 for his estab
lishmeut on the Palatine ; while
Messala gave $2,000,000 for the
house of Antony. Seneca, who
was just a plain philosopher, was
worth $12,000,000. Tiberius leit a
property of nearly $120,000,000.—
Caesar and Marc Antony both
owned wonderful fortunes. Why,
they talk about a man's failing in
New York for $1,000,000 as it it
were a big thing. Caesar, before
he entered pny office, when he was
a young gentleman in private life,
owed $1,000,000, and he purchased
the friendship of Quaesor for $2,
000,000. Marc Antony owed $1,
500,000 on the Ides ot March and
paid it before the Kalends of
March. This was nothing ; he
squandered $720,000,000 of public
money. Aud these fellows lived
well. Esopus, who was a play ac
tor, paid $400,000 for a single dish.
Caligula spent $400,000 for a sup
per. Their wines were often kept
tor two ages, and some of them
were sold for $20 an ounce. Dish
es were made of 'gold and silver,
set with precious stones. The beds
of lleliogabalus were of solid silver;
his tables and plates were of pure
gold ; and his matrasses, covered
With carpets ot cloth of gold, stuffed
with down from under the wing of
a patridge. It took $80,000 a year
to keep up the dignity of a Roman
Senator, and some of them $5,000,
000 a year. And yet they talk of
the extravagance of modern times.
Babies .—Some time ago there
was a dancing party given up
Northwest; most of the ladies pres
ent had little babies, whose noisy
perversity required too much atten
tion to premit the mothers to enjoy
the dance. A number of gallaut
young men volunteered to watch
the young ones while the parents
indulged in a "break down." No
sooner had the women left the ba
bies in charge of the mischievous
devils, then they stripped the in
fants, changed their clothes, giving
the apparel of one to another. The
dance over, it was time to go home,
and the mothers hurriedly took
each a baby in the dress of her own,
and started, some to their homes
ten or fifteen miles off, and were
tar on their way before daylight-—
But the day following there was a
tremendous row in the settlement;
mothers discovered that a single
night had changed the sex of ba
bies—observation disclosed the
physical phenomenon, and then
commenced some ot the tallest pe
destrianism ; living miles apart, it
required two days to unmix the
babies, and as many months to re
store the women to their natural
sweet dispositions. To this day
it is unsafe for the baby mixers to
veuture into the territory.
Few better replies are on
record than that of young Cheat
eauneuf, to whom a Bishop once
said: "If you tell me where God
is I will give you an orange." "If
you tell we where he is not I will
give you two," was the child's an
swer.

Mr. Dubois, of Fall River, has
had the blood of a live lauib intro
duced into his veins, as a remedy
for consumption. It is probable
that there will be no unusual effect
save an abnormal fondness lor all

"Alas !" said the nurse who at
tended the witty divine Sidney
Smith, in bis last illuess, "I have
made a mistake and giveu you a
bottle of ink." "Tlfeu," said the
dying wit, "fetch me all the blot

"Don't prevaricate, sir !"v thun
dered Judge Shell, to a witness,
"Can't help it, Judge," answered
the youth. "Ever since I got a
kick from a mule, that knocked my
teeth out, I prevaricate a good
deal."
Lawyer—"How do yon identify
this handkerchief ?" Witness—"By
its general appearance, and the
fact that I have others like, it."
Counsel (cutely)—"That's no proof,
for I have got one just like it in my
pocket." Witness (innocently)—
"I don't doubt that, as I had more
than one of the same sort stolen."
A woman in New Loudon, Conn.,
saw her husband carrying a lady's
satchel, and she tore the lady's
diess before discovering that it was
her mother, who had dropped down
on the evening train to surprise
her. Every husband in the laud
who is out evenings should read
this little item to wife and hold up
the dangers of her becoming sus
picious without the best of cause.
A Lesson in Adjectives
"Well, my son, you have got into
grammar, have you !" said a proud
sire to his thickest chip the other
night. Let me hear you compare
some adjectives."
Chip—"All right, dad, Little,
less, least ; big, beast ; mow, more,
most—"
Proud Sire—"Hold on, sir; that's
not right ; you—"
Chip—"Toe, tore, toast ; snow,
snore, snout; go, gore, gout; row,
roar, rout."
P. S.—Stop, I say, those adj—"
C.—"Drink, drank, drunk ; chink
chauk, chunk."
P. S.—"You infernal little fool !
What in thu-der—"
C.—"Good, better, best; wood,
wetter, wet; bad, wusser, worst;
bile, biler, Inllerbust ; sew, sewer,
sup; pew, door, pupouck; oh!
gemimi ! dad! o-o-O-W!
The outraged parent had broken

"My father was a farmer before
me, and I thank God that,I am a
farmer born." Such was th,e soap
Porter expected to soothe the gran
gers with on Fourth of July last.
It reminded Col. Geo. Stanley ot'
the Illinois orator who addressed a
rural audier.ee : " Gentlemen," said
he, "I am proud to be one of you.
My father was a farmer, and I am
a farmer born. Yes, I may truly

of corn." *At this juncture a tipsy
