Warning .—Single men, if you
don't want to fall in love, keep
away from calico. You can no
more play with girls without losing
your heart, than you can at roulette
without losing your money. As
Dobbs very justly observes, the
heartstrings of a woman—like the
tendrils of a vine—are always
reaching after more to cling to.
The consequence is, that before you
are going, you are gone, like a one
legged stove at auction.

THE WHITE LEAGUE.
an enthusiastic meeting
breaux's bridge.
AT
Edtitom N. 0. Bulletin :
Though not personally^ acquaint
cd with yon r I oder no apology in
forwarding these few hurried lines
because wo are on the same ship
and threatened by a furious storm
In this, our imminent danger,
every one aboard, oven the most
awkward passenger, must ofl'cr
some little help.
Yesterday was the day fixed for
a demonstration at Breaux's Bridge
ol the" 4 White League," to bo or
gam zed in tho parish of St. Martin,
at 12 o'clock in tho morning? We
proceeded to tho beautiful -Magno
lia Grove of Omer Martin, Esq., a
inifc lower than tho village. Al
ready two brass bands were on the
spot, calling in stirring notes the
Gueriniero Bienvenue, Esq., of
St. Martinsville, was chosen as
president of tho meeting and half
a dozen ot tho best men of tho par
ish elected as Yiftj Presidents. O.
L. Delelis, editor ot the Attakapas
Sentinel , acted as Secretary.
Upon the unanimous call of the
assembly, which was immense and
full of enthusiasm, General A do
Clouet in mild, unassuming but se
rious and candid manner delivered
an address, every syllable of which
was listened to with profound at
tention, because all believe in his
unswerving ing'grity und in his de
votion to the best interests of the
State. The absence of our gallant^
leader, the patriotic and eloquent
Col. A. do Blanc, was greatly de
plored, but as ho was 111 Opelousas
attending to an important caso I kv
forc the Supreme Court it was im
possible for him to attend.
At this juncture occurred a pleas
ing episode. The charming and
beautiful ladies of the village and
conn toy presented to the President
of the assembly a snowy banner,
upon whose pure folds was taste
fully embroidered this significant
inscription : " White 0 League of
Breaux's Bridge. Justice to All."
When this beautiful ensign was
unfiled to tho breeze, Mrs. Thibo
deanx, tho worthy and estimable
relict of a gallant soldier, who gave
his life for the South, read an admi
rable address, which expressed in
the most felicitous manner the deep
sympathy of the r#oblc women of
Louisiana in the objects and pur
poses of the white league.
The next speaker was that inde
fatigable gentleman and effective
stump speaker of liio p.#>sh of La
fayette, C. II. Mouton, who ad
dressed the assemblage in both
French and English, holding his
audience spell-bound for nearly two
hours, by the magic of his oratory.
I have not time to speak in fitting
term of the eloquent addresses sub
sequently made by Messrs. Jules
iary, Gabriel Tournet and James
Mouton. The speech of the latter
gentleman was, however, esteemed
tho gem of the occasion by the la
dies present. ^
In compliment to the Spartan
band of St. Landry who first dared
to raise the banner of the White
League, our wfcole'assembly, with
out a dissenting v«iee, adopted the
whole programme of the resolufions
of the fearless .champions of our!
Caucasian birthrights, and recom
mewled thoseaJnHr'ableresolutwnsI*

to all our sister parishes.

THE COTTON SURPLUS.
Wo have been advocating the
policy of less cotton and more corn,
and of farmers and planters raising
everything that tliey need -upon
their places to sustain life, even
though they cannot produce tho
same amount in actual cash value ;
and by recent examples shown that
a planter actually loses money by
tho one-crop system, and the coun
try is getting poorer every year ;
and we are fully sustained in these
assertions by that best of authority,
Prof. J. R. Dodge, of tho Depart
ment ot Agriculture, at Washing
ton, in Iiis address before tho Na
tional Agricultural Congress, held
at Atlanta, Ga., last month. In re
ference to tho Southern States, ho
says :
"The cotton States, have been
especially persistent in disregard
ing tho teachings of statistics and
defying the laws of political econo
my. Every intelligent publicist
snows that a certain amount
money, say a present average of
$300,000,000, may be derived from
cotton. If the average quantity is
ncreased the price diminishes, and
vise versa.
" If fluctuations are frequent the
speculator or manufacturer, and
not tho producer, derives an ad
antage. If you choose to produce
»,000,000 bales, you obtain 10 cents
l®r pound and lose money ; if you
•row but three, you get 2.""» cents
and obtain a profit. Now, it is bet
tor for the world, and in a series of
ears, better for the grower, to pro
duce .regularly enough to supply
the current wants >f tho trade
at a medium and 'remunerative
price, or as near a regular supply
as possible, for the vicissitudes of
the season will inevitably cause in
jurions fluctuations despite the
highest/effort of human wisdom and
foresight. As tho uses of cotton
increase, and markets are extended
throughout the world, its manufac
turo will be enlarged, and its cnl
tiire should obtaiu corresponding
enlargement. To overstep tli'o
boundary of current demand aiid
glut the market, may bo pleasing
to the speculator, and to The manu
facturer, so far as lie combines
speculation with weaving, but it is
death to the grower."— [Our Home

A Man Who Wants to Meet Bowles.
From.tlie Toledo Blade.
At Springfield there is a delay of
half an hour, and one is glad to.
stretch liisr legs by a walk up and
down tho streets. Springfield il
more like a Western city than any
place I have becu in East of Buffa
lo. The streets are not built up
solidly, but are fast being so., The
United States arsenal and the rail
road shops have built up the city.
It is quite a railroad center, and
will grow more in the next ten years
than in the last. Many manufacto
ries are starting, and the people are
enterprising. Insurancc©is quite a
leading business, but tho Republi
can has done more to make Spring
field known throughout tho conn
try than aught elso. It is tho best
paper in New England, and one of
tho best edited papers in the coun
try.
I supposed every one in these
parts liked the Springfield ltepub
licau, but found orçe man that did
not. He got on at Thompsonville,
and I offered him a Republican I
had finished reading, but lie hand
ed it back when he read the name,
saying: ^
"I dont' want any new!s from that
paper."
"I supposed that everybody road
it in these parts/' I answered.
"Has it been pitching into youF
"Pitching into mo? Great Caesar!
I should say it had. It it had only
pitched int£ me, I wouldn't care.
But just let*mo meet Bowles"
"You never make anything by
striking an editor," I said ; "bet
ter grin and bear it."
"Yes ; that's all right for yon to
say ; but just let me meet Bowles !
I'll show him how to run a paper."
"What did he do?"
"I)o ? lie did a good deal. Here's
how it is, T often went up to Spring
field on the last train at night, did
my business in^tlio evening, and
came homo on the first morning
train. Well, on'C night I met an
old crony, and we went to' Music
Hall !o the theatre. Wheu we
eamo out wo met two girls that Jim
said were his cousin ; but they
•weren't ; it was all a fraud. I did
not know it, and when Jim offered
his arm to one girl I did tho same
to the other. They took us to their
rooms, and I saw how it was. Of
course I couldn't get right out, so I
treated ; then Jim treated ; then
the girls treated. In fact, wo were
having a pretty good time, when
some fellows came in and began to
raise a row. Iiî less than no time
the police were in and had. us. The
next morning I wife hauled belore
the court and fined $7 40. I didn't
ara much, because I gave a false
name, and I knew my wife couldn't
find it out; but, the next morning,
I'll bo eternally flunked if that Re
publican didn't have it all in and
my own name too."
"Did your wife sec it!"
"I should say she did."
"Did she make a fuss F
"Fuss! Godfrey, Elishua! Are
you married ?" #
"Ycs # "
"Then you know how it is. I
have "to go to Springfield in day
time now. Just let me see Bowles."
"But," said I, feeling Ï ought to
take a newspaper's part, "you can
hardly blame him, you know. It
was only the propar enterprise."
'Enterprise! enterprise be d—11 !
There's such a thing as having too
much enterprise."

lowing among its marriage notices:
"On the 18th inst., Mr. T. Winkle

The True Doctrine.
From the Now Orleans Bulletin.
Mr. James Tofld, a planter in the
parish of St. Mary, who, according
to the Now Orleans Republican,
a Northern man, has written a very
sensible letter to tho Brasbcar
News on the subject of employing
men hereafter who will not vote in
opposition to his interests. °The
views be expresses are so sensible,
and the reasons he adduces so for
cible, that wo rescue the letter from
tlie unmerited oblivion to which it
had been consigned by the Rèp 11b
lican, for the benefit of the public;
If all our planters will follow the
example ot Mr. Todd, Louisiana
will soon be redeemed :
I have many colored men on my
plantation who assure mo that they
will not vote at tho election. Such
men I will always employ. I have
no desire to force any oue to vote as
I do, but I claim tho right to em
ploy on my plantation those who
will protect my interests at all
times and in every mauner. I do
not propose to break my contract
with my laborors on .account of
their votes, but I do propose to
make no contract in tho future with
those who will destroy my interests
and rights if they are afforded tho
opportunity.
Iam justified in this course by the
example of General Grant, W. P
Kellogg and all Radicals in power,
who will not .appoint men of oppo
site political opinions to office, and
further, will remove persons from
office if they dare to vote contrary
to tho interests of the Radical par
ty, even though they are among tho
"argo taxpayers of the country
With such exam pics before me, why
should I not refuse to employ those
who support by their votes the
thieving scoundrels who live only
to rob 111c ? Ï have been carrying
on my plantation for the last seven
years at great expense for the bene
fit of whom, myself? No; for the
benefit of the negro, the carpet-bag
ger and tho scallawaj^ and I pro
pose to do so no® longer. I prefer
that it should, grow up in weeds;
that it should become, a wilderness,
Tatlior than that it should be tho
source by which those vultures of
society are fed aud fattened.
But I can obtain a sufficient num
ber of good white and honest color
ed men to work my plantation with
out employing my enemies, and I
intend to do so.
A Thrilling Speech .—During
tho recent canvasé in this county
for nominations by tho "primary
election," Dick Lucas, of tho city,
was a candidate for tho jailership.
He is an orator of his own peculiar
sort, and deals in a kind of elo
quenco which has scarcely a par
allel. At Bristow Station ho deliv
ered himself in a singularly feeling
and impressive manner, addressing
the crowd of eager listeners as fol
lows :
Fell^vs-C itizens —Where are
my opp^'ents? Why, gentlemen,
they are nowhere. I feel myself as
much above my opponents as a pos
sum in a persimmon tree does above
the ground he crawls 00. I call on
yon in the name of the shrggyhead
ed lion, which whipped the Ameri
can eagle ; I call on you in the name
peacock of liberty, which flewed
over the Rocky Mountings-to come
to my rescue. Come on Monday
next and promote Dick to the office
to wlwch he perspires. When you
shall have been dead, and the green
briers shall have entwined them
selves around your graves, then
will your sons como to me and
say, Dick, some years ago our lath
ers voted for you for tho office of
jailership of Warren county; then
will I say, Roll on thou silver moon.
I will be with three till the last day
in the evening.—[Bowling Green
Ky .j Democrat.
What Was It f
From tbe New Orleans Bulletin.
A few evenings since as a car—
filled with ladies and gentlemen—
was en route down town from tho
upper districts, a very elegantly
dressed and beautiful lady rang tho
bell. When the car stopped at the
crossing the young lady rose from
her scat gracefully glided Oüt of tho
door. Instantly, however, there
was observed the most remarkable
effect upon the countenance ot eve
ry individual in the car, the ladies
were blushing rosy red and almost,
forcing their pearly teeth through
their coral lips to keep from laugh
ing, while the gentlemen turned
red and white by turns, as they
glanced furtively at something 011
tho floor of ttib car just whore tho
lady had been sitting. It was a
very curious article to bo sure and
lay there as coiled up «nd content
ed as possible. It was of a bright,
crimson color, about twelve inches
in length, aud had tbe ihost ingen
ious golden clasp at each end. Ev
erybody stared at it and though
there seemed© nothing especially
funny about it, it was tlie source of
intense merriment in others.
Finally one gentleman, more dar
ing than the rest, made a dash at.
it, grasped it firmly in his dexter
hand awd rushed after tho lady—
who, hearing his excited exclama*
tions, stopped, turned, advanced
with inimitable grace toward tho
gentleman, extended her hand to
receive tho article, with thanks
written in every feature of her smil
ing face, when, suddenly discover
ing what it was, she started as if
shot, an expression of horror over
spread her features, and exclaming
with marked hauteur and indigna
tion, "That is not mine, sir," turn
ed and walked off like an offended
queen. The feelings of the gentle
man may be fancied, but can never
be described. Ho returned to tho
car a sadder but wiser man, and
throwfiig the crimson devil 011 tho
floor, rest; med his seat amid an ex
plosion of laughter.
It a lady should accidcntly drop
her head, bonnet or chignon or any
other appendage hereafter in tho
presence of that gentleman, it is
safe to assume he would not pick it
up for tho fabled wealth of Croesus.
He says it hrPwcro an Englishman
lu» would never submit to being
made a Knight of the Garter.
Selling Short on Bourbon.—
A familiar scene in 200 or 300 new
drinking saloons that would be
gpencd in ease î?o. License should
carry, would bo something liko
this—tho boys have it°all put up :
Thirsty Customer—Mr. Barkeep
er, what will®five gallons and a gill
of your best whisky cost ?
Mr. B.—$.30 25.
T. C.—Cheap enough. I'll take
it.
Demijohn is handed down ; T.
C. takes a nip, smacks his lips, and
informs M t . B. that on the wholo
ho thinks ho will not keep the
balance, and suggests that Mr. B.
shall buy it back. Mç. B., always
ready for a bargayi, offers $30 10
for it, which offer T. C. accepts, pay
ing the 10 cents difference. You
see, ho "sells short" on Bourbon,
seller 15." Jolly, isn't it ? A ten
gallon transaction, and only 15 cents
