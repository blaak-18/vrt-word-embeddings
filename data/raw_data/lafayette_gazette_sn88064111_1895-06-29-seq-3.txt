The young folks-the real young
folks-few of them out of their
teens, gave a dance at Falk's hall
last Saturday. It was a most joyous
affair. How could it be otherwise?
Such a gathering of handsome lads
and pretty lasses bent on pleasure
and not get it would be something
unheard of. They had gone there
with the prime object to have some
fun and secondarily to learn how to
dance. The first part of the pro
gram was carried out to perfection
while the dancing Was at times so
delightfully entrancing as to chal
lenge the admiration of Terpsicore
herself.
Hon. Charles Delhommer died at

fore one-half ot the bottle had been
used I was well. I recommended
it to my friends and their experience

Mount Carmel Convent.
While Lafayette may not be as
fortunate as some of her sisters in
the possession of many things ne
cessary to make a modern town, we
believe that in educational facilities
she is in no sense of the word a lag
gard in the race. With two good
public schools, several private ones,
and the grand institution whose
name is at the head of this article,
our little city is certainly entitled to
be placed among the first of the list
of Louisiana towns. Not only at
home are the splendid advantages
of the Mount Carmel Convent ap
preciated, but miles away, in dis
tant parishes, the people have learnt
to know its worth as a school for
girls, as is evidenced by the fact that
among the boarders are young
ladies from different parts of the
State. Under the motherly care of
the good sisters the girls are af
forded unexcelled opportunities to
store their minds with knowledge,
for the teachers are able, painstak
ing and experienced, and the curri
culum is complete. The convent
building is a handsome and com
modious structure, the class rooms
are well-furnished and very airy,
and the grounds broad and shady.
In fact there is everything calcu
lated to please the student and to
enhance the appearance of the sur
roundings.
A few days ago the sisters began
to train the girls for the entertain
ment which took place at their hall
last Wednesday night. It was a
laborious undertaking, but with
their well-known energy and tact,
they worked early and late until the
smallest detail of the program was
properly arranged. The entertain
ment was a most creditable affair,
and though the program was - quite
lengthy, the large audience listened
attentively to its entire rendition,
despite the intense heat. The
songs, sketches, drilling, etc., were
all well rendered.
Thursday morning the distribu
tion of premiums took place. A
number of beautiful gold and silver
medals were awarded to the de
serving ones. A hundred or more
books were also given away as
priTes.
The bo)s had their day before
the girls. Tuesday hid been fixed
for them and they were by no means
forgotten. They too, were entitled
to some premiums, and we are sorry
that we have taken up all our space
to speak of the girls and can not
say more About them.

In another column of this paper
will be found the proceedings of the
last meeting of the Police Jury. It
will be seen that a compromise has
been entered into with a number
of gentlemen doing business in the
additions whereby they have paid
to the parish So per cent ot the li
censes of 1893 and 1894. They also
bind themselves to pay the licenses
of 1895. One of the parties agree
ing to the compromise informed
The Gazette that it is his intention
to institute suit against the corpo
ration of Lafayette for the recovery
of the licenses paid in 1893 and
1894, upon the ground that they
were illegally collected.

School Picnics.
Profs. Ben F. Toler and Will
Webb of the Royville and Theall
schools gave a picnic to their pu
pils Saturday near Olidon's bridge,
There were a large number of peo
ple present. Most of them were
patrons of the schools. All sorts of
good things had been brought to
the grounds and all enjoyed a splen
did dinner. Upon invitation Prof.
Alcibiades Broussard, of Vermilion
parish, had come with his pupils.
The children entertained the large
crowd with recitations and short
sketches. They all did well show
ing how they had been taught by
their painstaking teachers. Mr.
J. O. Broussard, president of the
school board, introduced Mr. Julian
Mouton to the assemblage. In his
introductory remarks Mr. Brous
sard spoke feelingly, making a fer
vent appeal to the mothers and
fathers to educate their children.
Mr. Mouton then made an address
in the French language. Prof. Ben
Toler was the next speaker. He is
an earnest worker in this great
cause and his remarks, though brief,
were appropriate and to the point.
Dr. Cushman then made a short ad
dress. A good time was had by all
present and the wish of everybody
was that Profs. Toler and Webb will
continue to teach in the Royville
and Theall schools.
The pupils and patrons of Prof.
Claude Martin's school and those
of Prof. Chas. Boudreaux's school
had a most delightful time at a pic
nic near Mouton's bridge last Tues
day. There were at least two hun
dred people present and it is safe
to say that not one of this large
number was not glad for being
there. The old as well as the
young seemed to enjoy themselves
to their hearts' contents. To see
the old gray-haired man commingle
in.boyish games with the little girls
and boys could but exercise an
ennobling influence on the mind and
presented a pleasing sight.
Miss Alzire Guidroy, a bright
little girl of Prof. Boudreaux's
school, presented a beautiful bou
quet to Prof. Martin, as a token of
the esteem in which he is held by
them and as an acknowledgement
of his invitation to be present at
the picnic.
Recitations and sketches by the
children of Prof. Martin's school
were an interesting part of the day's
program. The little folks did re
markably well in performing their
parts. Some of them acted like old
stage players. Their delivery was
good, and considering the fact that
English is not their mother tongue,
their pronunciation was surprising
ly clear and distinct. Thorough
discipline was also a noticeable
feature of the little outdoor enter
tainment.
The people remained on the
grounds until late in the afternoon.
WVhen they were about to leave the
conventional picnic rain caused a
few to hurry on to find shelter at
home.
Prof. Martin's school is one of
best in the parish. It has an enroll
ment of forty-five. Owing to the
fact that some of the patrons of this
school need their children at home
during the cotton-picking season,
vacation will only begin in Septem
ber.
Prof. Chas. Boudreaux's school
is situated near Lebesque's planta
tation. It is a new school and for
this reason Prof. Boudreaux was
placed in charged. He has had
extensive experience in school
teaching and it was not long berore
he had enlisted the support of the
people of that neighborhood in the
establishment of a good school.

S. F. B. MiORSE, G. P. & 1. A.
At her residence in this town at
ro o'clock p. m. on June as, Mrs.
W. B. Erwin died after a short ill
ness. Like one falling asleep, quietly
and calmly, she passed from time
to eternity to render her final ac
count to her Maker. In her illness
she was ministered to by kind and
loving hands, and at her last hour
there were gathered near, her lov
ing daughters and other kindred
and friends who wept for her de
parture. Such an end was well be
fitting a life so well spent.
The maiden name of Mrs. Erwin
was Sophia T. Crow; she was the
daughter of the late Basil C. Crow,
one of the earliest settlers of this par
ish, and a lawyer of distinction in his
time. She was a native of this par
Ish and was raised and educated
here, having attended for some time
the Convent of the Sacred Heart at
Grand Coteau in St. Landry parish.
She was a woman of considerable
natural gift mentally, much im
proved by reading. Her husband
was the late Dr. William B. Erwin,
a skillful physician of this parish
who fell at his post of duty in the
yellow fever epidemic that swept
over this section in the fall of 1867.
In all the relations of life the de
ceased was a most examnplary char
acter. Whether as daughter or wife
or mother she was devoted, loving
and true. As a fried and neighbor
she was kind and charitable; indeed,
she typified the most excellent attri
butes of a God-like life. She has
crossed over the river, but the mem
ory of so noble and worthy a matron
is one which lingers as a bright light
for those who would know how to
live the only life worth living.
The deceased was followed to her
last resting place by a large number
of relatives and friends, and now
sleeps with loving ones who had
gone before. She left four daughters
who, weeping over their bereave
ment, have yet the precious heri
tage of her memory.
At Royville.
Crops are splendid. The country was
never healthier. The farmers seem all hap
py. Present indications point to a full re
vival of trade this fall.
B. Falk, Esq., of Lafayette was seen in
town Sunday.
Royville will send a solid and representa
tive delegati n to Lafayette on July 4th.
Dr. Scranton's lovely and acc amplished
daughter, Miss May, acccmpanied by Master
G. G. Scranton, returned home Thursday
for vacation. Miss May is of the Domin
ican Academy, New Orleans, whilst Master
Gustave attended school at St. Stanislaus
College, Bay St. Louis, Miss.
Miss Leah Landry is spending vacation
with her parents.
Dr. R. O. Young and Mr. A. A. Mouchet
were visiting in historic old St. Martinville
Sunday.
A cucumber tipping the scales at two and
a half pounds was left at our office by our old
friend, Fracis Joseph Rageur.
Alexander Delhomme, Esq., of Scott, was
a guest of Dr. Scranton Monday.
Miss M. Cayret, of Scott, is visiting at
Bellevue.
Prof. Alcibiade Broussard will attend the
Normal school at Rustan, La., this summer.
The school commencement and picnic of
last Saturday was a genuine success. Mr.
Webb, assisted by Mr. Toler, cleverly
managed the affair, and all guests wer:
made to feel as comfortable as circumstan
ces permitted. The schools have certainly
made rapid progress and are now in a very
flourishing condition. The program map
ped out consisted of dialogues, recitations,
songs, speeches, etc., and the fine showing
made by the children, reflects much credit
on Messrs. Webb and Toler, the able and
skilled teachers. The address of welcome
by Master Ferdinand Tarbarlet, of the Webb
school deserves especial mention.
The pleasures of the day closed with a
splendid dinner, and three short speeches by
Messrs. Mouton, Cushman, Broussard and
Toler. This "scribe" returns thanks for
the many courtesies extended him.
Amongst the large gathering of friends
and patrons of the schools, the following
strangers were in attendance and enjoyed
picnic dinner: Mesdames. Hahn, Brous
sard, Cushman and Walker, Misses Pharr,
Higgins and Wallis, Messrs. Julien Mouton,
Ike Broussard, J. O. Leblanc, Walker,
Randle, Wallis, John Taylor, i. W. Brous
sard.
Should rumors be correct only eight can
didates are out for clerk of court, with fair
probabilities of a whole dozen. By the by,
talking about that office reminds us of that
memorable convention held at Scott four
years ago, when the late lamented Emile
Creighton coveted the nomination. That
convention should figure on the annals of
this parish, as the most one sided, put up and
cut and dried "job" ever attempted, a-tnl
the way the "'trick" wassuccessfully played,
shows how "slick" some of Lafayette's
politicians are. WVill another "'Scott Dlemo
cratic Convention" select the new clerk of
court? Hardly!
Concerning the district judgeship, it
should seem as if aspirants are at bay,
awaiting a fovorable opportunity to jump
up and claim the honorable plum. "En
tons cas," if "'Cherokee" is not erring, that
race will be of the Greek vs. Greek style,
with the tug of war closely following.

in Carencro, the guest of her sister,
Mrs. WV. B. Robert.
The arrest of the Arcenaux ne
groes by Sheriff Broussard was cer
tainly a good piece of work, and
solved the mystery as to who com
mitted the burglary at Mr. II. Crou
chet's store on the night of April
27th. At :he time of the robbery
there was absolutely no clue with
the exepti'n of the fact that it was
knowvn t.at there were a number
of particular articles stolen, tha~l
cIould aid our energetic sheirf int
locating the thief. But Isaac bided
his time and ''bagged his bird."
Master Laennec Francez, the son
of our esteemed citizen, Dr. J. P.
Frarcez, returned home on the s9th
after completing his first session at
Sring Hill College; it was' also our
ple: sure to greet Mr. Arestide
Francez, who had attended the
same institution.
Camillus Sonnier, the son of Mr.
and Mrs. Adam Sonnier, died at
the residence of his parents near
Carencro on June 5tst. He was
but eleven years of age, bright be
yond his years, loved and loving,
and seldom .has it fallen to the lot
of your correspondent to announce
the death of a child more popular
and more generally admired. We
have heard naught but words of
sympathy for the stricken parents
in their great loss, and expressions
of sorrow occasioned by the death
of this little boy.
Mr. G. H-I. Guilbeau's new store
building is nearly completed and

Mr. J. Edmnond Villere is the build

building.
Little Miss Marcelle Blot returned
last Sunday from New Orleans
where she has been attending school.
Her many little friends rejoice at
her return.
It is doubtful if there ever was a
question so thorougly discussed, a
question with which one can feel
so entirely "at home", and so com
pletely "at sea", as the money
question. One moment we congra
tulate ourselves on our wonderful
sagacity, while the next we feel
constrained to admit a painful igno
rance. We laugh at the argument
of others, only to hear outselves
ridiculed when our turn comes to
speak.
Miss Emma Duchamp, of St.
Martinville, an,' Mr. Mortimer
Olivier, of New Iberia, who were
guests at the Latiolais-M-lchior
wedding, returned to their home
last Saturday.
Mr. Edward LaBerge, of Mon
treal Canada, who has been the
guest of Father Laforest, left for
New Orleans last week, where he
intends to reside permanently. Al
though a resident of Carencro for
scarcely three months, he became
popular, and made many true and
staunch friends who regretted his
departure, and wish him every suc
cess in his new home.
An amateur variety and dramatic
troup of Sunset have announced
an entertainment to take place in
Carencro on the 6th of July. A
portion of the receipts will be do
nated to the new church fund. We
understand that they give a very
creditable performance, well worth
seeing. There will be a balloon
ascension, and tight rope walking.
Refreshments and dancing.
lWell, what is sugar cane to be
worth the coming season? If our
farmers can not realize two dollars
per ton, they will surely cease to
cultivate it. Experience has taught
them that they can not raise it, at a
much lower figure.
Father Girard, S. J., long and
favorably known in Carencru, was
the guest of Father Laforest last
Saturday and Sunday. He left for
Canada on Monday, where he will
hereafter be permanently located.
There was a meeting of a number
of the young men of our town at the
store of Mr. A. Guidry, a few nights
ago, for the purpose of reorganizing
the Carencro Brass Brand. The
following officers were elected for
the ensuing year: D. A. 1)imitry,
president; O. P. Guilbeaux, vice
president; Ogon Guidry, secretary;
and Phil. Broussard, treasurer.
Almost anyone will admit that
there is a vast difference between
ham and beets, almost as much as
exists between the conventional
"ham and eggs" and yet Carencro
can boast of a .citizen that can see
no difference between the two while
eating either.
