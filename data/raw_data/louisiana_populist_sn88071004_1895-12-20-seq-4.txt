IN ARCTIC REGIONS.
A CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL AMID
ICE AND SNOW.
How t'e Members of the Peary Expedi
tion 'Passed the Day-Teaching the
Eskimos American Manners-Loath to
Quit the Dinner Table.
RS. PEARY, who
spent so many te
dious months with
her husband in the
Arctic regions, was
---determined that the
holidays should not
pass her by unno
ticed; and so.
though she was liv
n g in the most
primitive fashion,
with a frozen wori:l P.ll about her, she
made hearty thoug. aimple prepara
tion for festivity.
They spent. she says. r day In deco
rating the interior of tilt'. Arctic home
for the Christmas and Ne' trear festivi
ties. In the larger of the two rooms
the ceiling was draped witls red mos
quito netting. Wire candeobra and
candleholders were placed in all the
torners and along the walls. Two large
United States flags were crossed at one
end of the room, and a silk sledge flag
was put up on the opposite corner.
I gave the boys new cretonne for cur
tains for their bunks, and we decorated
the photographs of our dear ones at
home with red, white and blue ribbons.
We spent the evening in playing
games and chatting, and at midnight
Mr. Peary and I retired to our room to
open some letters, boxes and parcels
given us by kind friends, and marked:
"To be opened Christmas eve at mid
night."
On Christmas da;' we had what we
considered the jolliest Christmas din
ner ever eaten In the Arctic regions,
and then we invite(: our faithful natives
to a dinner cooked Ir,, us and served at
our table, with our dishes. I thought it
would be as much fun for us to see them
eat with knife, fork and spoon as it
would be for them to do it.
After our meal had been cleared
away, the table was set again, and the
Eskimos were called in. We had nick
names for all of them, and it was the
I "Villain" who was put at the head of
the table, and told that he must serve
the company just as he had seen Mr.
Peary serve us.
The "Daisy" took my place at the foot
of the table, and her duty was to pour
the tea. The "Young Husband" and
"Misfortune" sat on one side, while
"Tiresome" and the "White Man" sat
opposite.
It was amusing to see these queer
looking creatures, dressed entirely in
the skins of animals, seated at the
table, and trying to act like civilized
people. Both the Villain and the Daisy
did their parts well.
One incident was especially funny.
i The White Man, seeing a nice-looking
i.piece of meat in the stew, reached
across the table and endeavored to pick
"It was amusing to see these queer
looking creatures."
It out of the dish with his fork. He
was Immediately reprovet by the Vil
lain, who made him pass his mess pan
to him, and then helped him to what he
thought he ought to have, reserving,
however, the choice piece for himself.
They chattered and laughed and
seemed to enjoy themselves very much.
Both women had their babiles in the
hoods on their backs, but this did not
hainder them in the least. Although at
times the noise was great the little ones
slept through It all. The Daisy
watched the cups very carefully, and as
soon as she spied an empty one, she
would say:
"Etudo catee? Nahme? Cafee peeuk."
(More coffee? NoT The coffee is good.)
Finally at ten o'clock the bitg lamp
was put out, and we told them it was
time to go to sleep, and that they must
go home, whiceh they reluctantly did.

IN 1620.
The First Christmas Celebration on This
Continent.
It was in the year 1620 that the Puri
tans passed their first Christmas in
America. By referring to a copy of the
old Bradford manuscript it will be
found that the early settlers evi
dently determined not to celebrate their
first Christmas in a new land except by
hard work. William Bradford writes of
it in this manner: "Ye 16 day ye wlnde
came faire, and they arrived safe in this
harbor. And afterward tooke better
view of ye place, and resolved wher to
pitch their dwelling; and ye 25 day be
gane to erect ye first house for com
mon use to receive them and their
gt; s, " To look lact' upon those ear
ly days. when our forefathers by hard
labor toiled for a house for all, make,
one realize In some degree the advance
ment of our country. Bradford contin
ues as follows: "Munday. the 23 day,
we went on shore, some to fell tymber.
some to saw, some to rine and some to
carry, so no man rested all that day.
but towards night some, as they were
at worke, heard a noyse of some In
dians, which caused us all to goe to our
Muskets. but we heard no further, so
we came aboard again and left some
twentie to keep the court of gard; that
night we had a sore storme of winde
and rayne. Munday, the 23 day, being
Christmas Day, we began to drinke
water aboord, but at night the Master
caused us to have some Beere, and so
on board we had diverse times now and
then some Beere, but on shore none at
all."
The Mistletoe.
A score of intelligent ana well-in
formed persons, assembled in a draw
ing-room one evening, were asked to
give the habits and peculiarities of the
mistletoe. Without exception they de
scribed it as a parasitic plant growing
upon the oak. This almost universal be
lief comes, no doubt, from associating
the plant with the oak which the Druids
venerated. It is, however, regarded as
exceptional when a mistletoe flourishes
on al oak-tree. An eminent authority
declares that there were a few years
ago less than a score of oaks in all Eng
land-on which this parasite was found.
The Meaning of Christmas Day.
The keynote of Christmas joy is
"Peace on earth, good will to
men." The first Christmas Day that
ever dawned brought rejoicing in its
wake. On that day there was born in
Bethlehem. Judea, a Savior, who is
Christ the Lord. For those weary with
sin, for those oppressed with sorrows,
for the troubled in mind, for the weak
and helpless He came. But not to these
alone. To the joyful and happy ones,
to those rich In this world's goods, to
the successful and prosperous He came.
To the whole world He appeared. None
were forgotten by Him. And now to
the outcast and to the weary one, to
the rich man and to the joyful child He
says the words, "Learn of Me."
If you suffer Christ pities you.
If you be lonely He is with you.
If you repent of sin He will keep you
in safety.
If you have great possessions He says
unto you, "Give to the poor."
The Tale Feast.
Let England have her plum pudding,
and let us have our own particular
-merican dishes on Christmas Day. A
comment was made by an English
woman upon Americans in general
yesterday. When asked what she had
noticed specially about Americans
during her two years' visit to this
country, she smiled at first and said
nothing. But when the request was re
peated and emphasized by the quest
ion: "Now what are you going to say
about us when youreturn to England
in fact, what are you going to say
behlnd our backs?" she replied.
"I shall probably say in criticism that
you disfigure the streets of New York
by having an elevated railroad, and
that all Americans are trying to be as
mueh like the English as possible,
and I do not see why this is. I should
thlank you would want your American
individuality preserved." For a Christ
mas dinner this year let us have some
dishes that belong to our own country,
and which not even Merry England
nor chivalrous France can furnish. The
dishes are not expensive, and of course
additions may be made.

Isabella Bird Bishop is regarded as
one of the most valuable members of

skilled both as a photographer and a
descriptive writer, she has sent home
to England from the orient mut h
novel an interesting material from
remote regions of China, Thibet and
Persia. She was one of the first wo
men to see the Coreans face to face,

but as she is a physician, with some

Some say that the hypo
phosphites alone are sufficient
to prevent and cure consump
tion, if taken in time. With
out doubt they exert great
good in the beginning stages;
they improve the appetite, pro
mote digestion and tone up
the nervous system. But they
lack the peculiar medicinal
properties, and the fat, found
in cod-liver oil.' The hypo
phosphites are valuable and
the cod-liver oil is valuable.
of Cod-liver Oil, with hypo
phosphltes, contains both of
these in the most desirable
form. The oil is thoroughly
emulsified; that Is, partly di
gested. Sensitive stomachs
can bear an emulsion when
the raw oil cannot be retained.
As the hypophosphites, the
medicinal agents in the oil,
and the fat itself are each good,
why not have the benefit of
all? This combination has
stood the test of twenty years
and has never been equalled.

A Pennsylvania prevaricator tells of
how two girls became infatuated with
the idea of having their pictures taken
with their heads coquettishly stuck
through a torn newspaper, and visited
a photograph gallery for that purpose.
When the pictures were finished they
were horrified to see they had failed
to notice, that in the newspaper they
had stuck their heads through, just
beneath their laughing faces, was a
clothing firm's advertisement headed:
*"Our pants are lined in the seat."
The Harrisburg girls were too much
