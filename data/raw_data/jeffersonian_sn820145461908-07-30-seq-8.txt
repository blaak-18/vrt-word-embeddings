Watson *s Peace-Offering
Rejected.
Could any man have gone farther than
Mr. Watson, in his efforts to keep down
political bitterness in Georgia?
He asked the Democrats to put a few
Populists on their electoral ticket, and to
print his name along with that of Bryan
on the ballot, so that the voter could
scratch Watson and vote Bryan, or
scratch Bryan and vote Watson.
With a magnanimitv which really laid
him open to the criticism of being incon
sistent, he proposed that, in the event
Watson received the electoral vote of the
state, he would deliver it to Bryan, in
case it should be indispensable to Bryan’s
election as president.
Was a more generous offer ever made?
Throughout the ranks of Populism, Mr.
Watson has been roundly censured for
making such a proposition. In other
states he has lost many supporters by
it. But so earnest was his desire for
an era of good will at home that he stood
pat on his offer.
And the Democrats have turned it
down. A more fatuous mistake was never
made.
See how they have stultified our state !
(1) We are on record as being opposed
to negro domination, but Georgia’s vote is
to be given to our Illinois hero whose
whole plan of campaign pivots on the ne
gro vote of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and
New York.
In national politics the weight of the
Empire State of the South is to be
thrown in favor of negro domination, in
the same year when the voters of Geor
gia are asked to do away with the possi
bility of negro domination in our state.
We have toiled and moiled to disfran
chise the negroes in the Southern States.
Yet Bryan is setting the vicious prece
dent of making the negro the umpire of
a dispute between the whites, in his dick
erings and deals with the negro leaders
on the other side of Mason and Dixon’s
line.
In our native state of Georgia the
whites, in the same election year, will
vote the negro out of state politics and
vote him into national politics. We will
close up the box on the hideous Genii
THE JEFERSONIAN.
of negro domination in our own state, but
will open it and bid the Colossus come
forth in national politics.
A MADDER PLUNGE TOWARD
POLITICAL CHAOS WAS NEVER
TAKEN.
Mark it well, gentlemen! The respon
sibility is yours.
(2) The whole state of Georgia is sat
urated with profound conviction on the
whiskey issue. Georgia is dry. So we
preach, so we sing, so we pray, so we
vote.
Yet the Democrats refused to allow
Watson, a life-long Prohibitionist, to
have the empty compliment of the elec
toral vote of his native state a state for
which his people have worked and fought
since early Colonial times when the can
didate of National Democracy has never
said a word in favor of Prohibition, when
his only vote on the issue was against
Prohibition, and when his running mate
is the standing attornev of the Brewers’
Combine of Indiana.
We can not believe that the action of_
the Democratic Committee in spurning
Mr. Watson’s peace offering will enthuse
the Democracy of Georgia. We believe
that there are tens of thousands of hon
est, fearless Democrats who will con
demn the Committee, and who will re
fuse to be made parties to the establish
ment of negro domination in national
campaigns.

<Bryan Smoked Out On the Ex-
Confederate Incident.
The indignant demand of the South in
general and the frantic appeals of fatuous
friends in particular, have, as we go to
press, resulted in Mr. Bryan breaking the
silence in which he had sought to bury
the charges against himself as to the Con
federate soldier.
And a pitiful plea is his long, flounder
ing letter, addressed to Judge C. R. Crisp
and published July 28th in The Atlanta
Constitution. In all its Bryanite wordi
ness, there is NOT ONE IOTA OF DE
NIAL.
In answer to the charge that he literal
ly threw away his vote on Mr. Springer
in the caucus, when Springer himself had
withdrawn in favor of Mr. Crisp, Mr.
Bryan mumbles something about not lik
ing “band wagon” politics. He does not
deny that he refused to vote for Mr. Crisp.
He hasn’t the flimsiest explanation to give
for his refusal. His wholly unnecessary
and irrelevant reference to the fact that
Mr. Springer had, when he visited Wash
ington, showed him courtesies, is worse
than absurd. If he wished to demon
strate his abiding gratitude for a former
hand-out, why did he not follow Spring
er’s own judgment when that gentleman
himself was supporting Crisp?
Mr. Bryan does not even faintly deny
the language attributed to him by Mr. Al
fred Henry Lewis: “I SHOULD NOT
CARE TO FACE THE OLD SOLDIER
ELEMENT ALONG THE PLATTE
WITH THE RECORD OF HAVING
VOTED FOR AN EX-CONFEDER
ATE!”
After waiting for weeks, in the hope
that he could bv silence evade that which
he could not possiblv deny, Mr. Bryan
has insulted public intelligence with puer
ile excuses.
Mr. Lewis’ charges have been abun
dantly proved.
Bryan has been smoked out! Last
week we said Bryan would dodge, and
we were right.

"Financial Folly.* 9
Is the name of a weekly paper just es
tablished in New York City, by Dennis,
O’Sullivan, whose book, “The Cold Sto
rage Baby,” is a terrible arraignment of
our present system of class-legislation.
In one of his editorials, Mr. O’Sullivan
calls attention to the fact that the money
plank as adopted by th-e Republicans
dropped the words “redeemable in,”
where they came in between “dollars”
and “gold.”
“Every dollar shall be based upon, and
as good as gold,” is the way the platform
reads.
That’s gold standard, without the omit
ted words.
H
Young TTr. Crisp to the Rescue.
The Bryanites are mightily worried
about that ex-Confederate business.
Well may they be. Mr. Watson knew
nothing of it until this year, for the facts
were not published in the Southern pa
pers. His attention was called to it by an
ex-Congressman of Georgia, and he im
mediately applied to Alfred Henry Lewis
for the story.
The standing of Mr. Lewis, as a gen
tlemen, is quite as -good as that of Mr.
Bryan, and in point of ability he is far
and away the superior of Bryan.
Mr. Watson believes the statement of
Mr. Lewis for two reasons:
(1) Because Mr. Lewis is a man of
honor, and had no motive whatever in
1891, when he first published the story,
to invent it.
(2) Because Bryan did not enter a de
nial at the time, and dodges the issue
even now.
In their distress the Bryanites appeal to
young Mr. Crisp. Please read his state
ment carefully. Says he:
“Mr. Bryan supported Mr. Springer,
of Illinois, in the caucus for speaker in
December, 1891. Mr. Bryan was raised
in Mr. Springer’s district, and the rela
tionship between the two was very close.
After the caucus Mr. Bryan voted for
my father for speaker, and this the Con
gressional Record will show. My father
and Mr. Bryan were close friends. In the
succeeding caucus, Mr. Bryan was an
active supporter of my father for speak
er and voted for him, both in the caucus
and in the house. My father appointed
Mr. Bryan on the leading committees.”
Now, is it not clear that young Mr.
