m11 an \1a:.ll)burn, ()f the ('hica:ro

nlittee. "To the voters of the
United States. Our facilities for
receiving the election returns are
equal to any. We know front pri
vate advices and the returns up to
(late, that McKinley is not elected.
On the other hand the latest re
turns justify our claim that Mr.
<I Bryan is elected. It is one of the
peculiarities of republican enter
n prise that they always claim every
p thing in sight a few hours after
election.
In 1s'7; as well as in 18`+4 it was
not known for three or four (lays
which candidate had won, although
is the early returns indicated republi
can success, democratic followed.
- Again four years ago the early re
r. turns favored Harrison's election,
i. while the subsequent ones elected
r. Cleveland. This year the early
t- returns favored McKinley because
n they came from the eastern and
)f middle states and from cities of
other states, while the returns
from the south and west were with
n held, so as to stampede public sen
:s timent, that McKinley was elected,
1e whether he was or not and thus
1. create sentiment in advance which
would operate to his advantage in
case the election was contested,
n while on the other hand, had the
' first returns announced Bryan's
success and a contest resulted there
would be an uprising of the peo
ple through fear of a repetition of
the Tilden episode.
We have positive evidence that
the republican-national committee
have wired their state committee
to claim certain states which are
in doubt fearing that the subse
quent returns might indicate Bry
an's election. We shall soon vig
a orously press the question, if it is
f not for the purpose of manipula
I. ting them, why are they held back.
it We want the American people to
y be patient and calm and to wait for
d the official returns and pay no at
o tention to the false reports sent
c out by manipulating committees.
e We also feel justified in assuring
the people that if Bryan is elected
he will be seated. The will ot the
o- I ple will never again be defeat
,t ed through the manipulations of
returning boards to capture the
presidency. The political crime
e of 1876 will be registered if re-I
11 peated.
JONES SPEAKS.

Chicago, November 4.--Chair
man Jones at noon today sent the
r following message to Mr. Bryan:
Wm. J. Bryan, Lincoln, Neb.-We
have along claimed for you the
Ssouthern states with 156, votes,
and the states west of the Misouri 1
r with 61 votes, leaving necessary to
e sucess 7 votes. I counted Michi- 1
gan and Minnesota. We have no
infortion except by press dispatch
es, indieating that we have lost
many of these states. On the con
trary, we are positively assured of
all the southern states except Ma
ryland and that we have not heard
fnom. The west so far as heard

hihlcl'i" ('htnce.
- At this time it looks as if there
r- was little hope of Bailey's election
o in this district. \We have only
i- meagre returns from other parishes
ie but we judge the situation by this
r parislh, which gave Bailey a ma
-e jority of 486 in 1894, and now gives
i_ Ogden a majority of 124, by Pop
:o ulists staying at homne.
1. The election so fir as heard from
- seems to have been reasonably fair,
r. with a few exceptions, though Bos
e sier has not been heard from.
- Bailey carries Sabine by onlly
- 2 inmajority, while Caddo gave
r lBailey 169 and Ogden 16t$, or a
majority of 1489 : Bienville is
claimeid by Ogden's friend at Ar
r cadia, by a majority of 400. Oth
h er claims for Ogden are, Rapides
15(0 ; eSoito, 1400; Bossier, 13(t1.
i
One thing remarkable is the
t, election at Cheneyville, which gives
Ogden 58, Bailey 14, or a majority
of only 44 for Ogden, while it was
408 in '91, Lots of Ogden's friends
there and in Bossier, Caddo, etc,,
have either died or moved away
since last election.
s Well, the partial victory for a
fair election is some consolationll
and if the Populists had half tried
they could have elected their man.
Many of the faithfils did their
is whole duty, but others did nothing
but growl about the action of their
n party, and this discouraged others.
The people will learn after awhile
l who their true friends are.

The Democrats gained for Og
re den 121 on the vote of 1594, while
the Po ulists lost 469 by staying

The vote for President was lar
ger and probably reached 1800,
about 1700 of which were for Bry
an and the Fusion ticket,.
o Well, money is stronger than
patriotism, if the election held last
Tuesday is any criterion, for Bry
an is a man of and for the people,
" and McKinley of and for the mon

e The Populists have elected 16
