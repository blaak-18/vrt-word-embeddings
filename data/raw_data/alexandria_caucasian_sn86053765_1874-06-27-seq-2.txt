Our neighbor, the Democrat,

building the School house. And
tiluit shingle business, if true, is
rather heavy on ono of the shining

LIVING ZSSÜZS.
To tli« tax-burdened, poverty
stricken and well nigh »tarring
people of Louisiana, the questions
of momentous importance are not
who is or who «hall bo President ;
whether or not the Democrat« aye
gaining glorious victories in the
North and West ; whether the doe
trine of Whites rights is a rocognlz
ed principle with the authorities of
the general government ; whether
the currency be or bo not inflated,
for if it whs , weliave nothing with
which to bring it into our State;
nor whether we have a ft ee or a
protective tariff. These are ail ques
tions that may legitimately agitate
the public mind of communities with
houses to cover their families and
with means to supply them with
the uctual necessaries of existence.
They can not be matters of any
great concern to us in Louisiana—
whose very roofs are or will .be sohl
to pay enormous taxes which we
did not levy nnd from which we
never have und never expect to do
rive nny kind of benefit.
Taxes to support a .State govern
ment of thieves and robbers, never
elected by the people. Taxes to
build levees which are never built.
Taxes to support public schools—
which are used for electioneering
purposes and to educate a lot of
kinky headed little apes and idiots,
whose teacher « even are ignorant
of the plainest rules of Grammar«
and whose highest achievement in
mathematics never embraced the
solution of a simplo problem iu tho
Unie of Three. And linally, taxes
to pay interest on ji del»t we-never
authorized or creafed and for which
we are neither morally nor legally
bound.
Tho two questions which pro
sent themselves, to our intelligent
consideration, nnd liko unbidden
guests, will force themselves upon
us whether we will or not, are plain,
practical and so common sense that
"tho wayfaring mau may rend as he
runs, and the laborer, t hough a fool,
need not err therein." They are :
Tlow can wo with freo negro labor
make enough to pay tho tax collec
tor, to prevent our homes from bo
ing sohl by hiin T And : Having
satisfied tho collector of these enor
mous taxes, and paid out of the
crop for tho support of tho negroes
who made but half a one, and who
vote every timo to increase tlieso
onerous taxes upon our property—
how can wo bavo enough lelt to
buy provisions and clothes (or our
own families' Tho answer to both
questions ciflr only be found in a
most complete-and thorough organ
ization of tho white people of the
State, that by their solid, united
vote this Fall, they may wrest from
tho negro, at tho polls, fairly and
squarely, his power to tax our prop
erty ; and that by uuunimtffty
among themselves, they may so
control the labor of the negroes that
they shall do moro work for less
pay. Without first having drawn
the fangs of this ungrateful ser
pent, which we have for so long
been wurming in our generous
bosoms, nnd without first*having
crippled tho sucking power of this
iusatiablo leech which lias been
drinking our very life blood, it is
impracticable foattcmpt to reform
our labor system, for the richer our
blood, tho more ravenous would be
tho appetite of the leech; tho warm
er our bosom, tho sooner would we
teel the poisoned fangs of tho ser
pent. •

Couldn't Get It.
A beautiful young maiden ac
compnnied by her expectant bride
groom and a lady friend, and hail
ing from tho "free State" of Vernon,
rode up to tho court house here one
duy this week and proceeded to In
terview Charles Owen, the Deputy
Clerk, upon the subject of a mnr
riugo license. Charley, naturally
inquisitive, in his tnrn interviewed
the verdant youth upon the subject
of tho ago of the bride, consent
the parents, residence etc. The re
suit ot Charley's unwarranted euri
osity, revealed tho fact that It was
a runaway match from Vernon par
ish,.thnt the bride was only rUno
teeu nnd that her obdurate mother
was opposed to tho marriage. The
D. C., couldn't stand such disobe
dience to parents and refused to is
sue the license. This decision, and
tho fact of the runaway couple be
ing at tho Court House caused no
little sensation among "the boys"
in town, and .numerous committees
waited upon tho stubborn official—
who turned a deaf ear to all entreat
ies. That buxom lassio and -eager
lover rode off sadder but no wiser,
aud with no immediate prospects
of wisdom.
It was too, bad, Charley, to treat
that forlorn dam-sol that way

N atchitooiieh P a r i h h .— We
publish by request the proceedings
ot the citizens and tax-payers of
.Natchitoches, held on June 13th,
wl^ich we commend to the conside
ration of our readers. The people
thero have determined that they
will no longer stand tho stealing
and cftrpet bag rascality which has
made the name of their Purish a
reproach and a byword among their
fellows. The names of their Com
mittee of Seventy embrace some ot
tho best and staunchest citizens of
the parish, and give promise of
doing what is needed for the ame
lioration of their condition. This
is a good move in the right direc
tion. The plunderers there may
look out for " squally tinles " and
and will doubtless have a " hard
road to travel# in the future.
The Republican there comes to us
this week filled with apologies and
excuses for the ring of thieves and
condemnation of the meeting of the
people. Such impudence and ef
froutry in tne organ of the ring, is
proof enough of the necessity of
somcsoctiou on the part of the peo
ple. ° Of course the Republican dont
want the people to do anything and
wants them to "obey the law"
when their passive submission to
radical laws gives it and the theives
full scope to rob and plunder. Cer
tainly the highwayman don't want
his victim to resist, he would rath
er that he should stand still and be
robbed without protest or resis
tance.

We published last week an arti
cle from this most able Journal uj •
on the "White League." That ar
ticle was the souree of no little trib
nlntion and considerable vexation
of spirit to the New Orleans Repub

ish white women, which exults in

The article copied below is the re

renders for its pfacticle good sense
aud for tho happiness of its retort i
In our laut isune we centended tlmt
the nearo, m a c I sm . In this State, had
proved himself a nobile »nemr, whctli
er knowingly or through stupidity, nnd
tlmt he should be taught hl» place—
should he starved into decency.
The lirpnbttmn takes Issue with as
on the point, and snstalns itself with
what arguments I First a pldllippic
against Father Ryan who has not beeu
In this State or any portion of the
.South for several months: secondlr—
another philippic against "prlfstly fei -
oritjj" thirdly, another against for
eigners, and fourthly, an appeal to tho
immediate interests of the wliltfcs.
Well I let ns see.
As regards Rev, Father Ryan, this is
not the first time that the Republican
has crossly violated the rules of journ
alistic etiquette in its personsl attacks
noon that gentleman. Whén person
ally present he'has always treated this
groHsness with the silent Contempt
which it deserved nt Iiis hands. ' Now,
in his absence, we allude to It not to
defend fiim, but to show how utterly
unreliable are statements found In tho
columns of that palter. The Republican
distinctly charges hirn with being 1st.
n "peripatetic priest" aad 2nd. proba
bly not a citizen, in fact n "foreign
priest." What will be. thought of tho*
reckless policy which will launch forth
such alloKatioiis without good and
strong gronnds for belief in them f In
this case, there is not a shadow of fact
on which to rest the charges.
Hut what if they wore true, and
what if Father Ryan had written th%
article iu question, would tlmt have
anything to do with the merits of tho
cn*e 7 I» U not a sign of weakness to
fly from the point in controversy and
tako refuge iy scurrilous personalities*
A* regard the slang of "priestly fo
rocity," it Is based, upon tho same dis
regard of facts as above. Nobody ever
proposed to starve the negro "to death"
but only to tho point of common sense.
Tho ferocity which prompts people to
protect themselves from niter lufti, by
witholding their pntronago from ene
mies who are Inevitably ruining them,
is ono which must commend itself to
tho commorient intelligence. It is on
ly an extraordinary ploty and forbear
ance, like that of (ho Republican, which
would continu« to ruin itself, in order
to foster its enemies, just as that dis
interested journal docs in the matter of
As regards the persistent Crusade of
tho Republican against "foreigners" its
disdainful'allusiou to "Hibernian" log
ic, its contemptuous allusion to our
Creole Ataknpas population as "French
people of St. Landry," we leave it to
the kind consideration of our African
population who are not descended from
the JlepuhliiHtn 1 « fore-fathers, nnd con
sequently not "Americans" in its sense,
aml^fve farther commend it to the sym
pathy of tho Iriah Republican Club.
Finally, our critic auks what will tho
planters, tho hoimokeepers, the yellow
lever patients and the babies, do with
out ncaroes 1 How many bales of cot
ton or hogsheads of sugar will bo madef
Mow will tho planters pay the batiks T

prietors who will hr«ve bonglit it at tax
sales;" or "how will delicate ladies do
their hnus»swork when they will not

er, wherewith to have a negro girl t
He docs not ask whether it would bo
bettetfto drop tho negro how, when
thero would be something left, or to
wait until ho would have to be drop
ed perforce because there would bo
nothing to pay him with.
But let us answer his question, de
ceptive and illogical a* it is. Let tho
white people go to work. There aro
plenty of them in this State to raise a
good crop. Even if they do not pro
duce a tenth as much cotton, ns with
negroes, they would rnako twice an
much money by it. Thoy would be—
like the Northern farmer, far more lu<
dependent and thriving than those who
hire negroes, nnd their wives would be
mncli more hoalthy aud cheerful with- ■
out the domineering servants under
whoso incompetency and insolence
they now groan.
As to the babies, we would niako
them ail "public printers," and they
would soon grow fat on the "pap" with
out any nurses.
