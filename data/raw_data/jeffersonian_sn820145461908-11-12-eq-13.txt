The Ad Man's Galley
By James Lanier.
1 he success of a paper or magazine
depends upon the igetive co-operation
and working friendliness of subscrib
ers and advertisers. At bottom, this
is a commercial proposition. For
many years Marshall Field paid an
old Leadville miner a salary of $6,000
a year for his ability to remember
names. He was a “floor-walker” in
the big Chicago store. A country
buyer who went into Marshall Field’s
was surprised to be met by the old
man who had spoken to him casual
ly three or four years before, and
greeted: “How do you do, Mr. Jim
son? Mighty glad to see you in town
again. How’s Jimsonville and all the
little Jimsons? Has Mrs. Jimson got
over that bad attack of rheuma
tism?” He felt friendly right away,
as country people will. He knew
that Marshall Field, through the old
man with the memory, had not for
gotten him, but had held him in mind
through years of absence. From that
moment Mr. Jimson was not only a
customer, firm and fast, but a friend
and a worker for Marshall Field.
So with a newspaper or magazine.
If your subscribers take a friendly
interest in you, believe in you and
work for you, your publication will
succeed in a measure that a paper
which has to buy its patronage can
never approach. One subscription
list is built on sand, and the other on
rock.
That’s where the Jeffersonians
come in. Our subscribers, we are
proud and glad to know, are our
friends. They take the paper, read
it, believe in it, tell their neighbors
about it. Not in one letter, but in
hundreds, the phrase is repeated:
“Here is my renewal; we can’t do
without the Jeffersonians.” That
makes us feel good. The kind word,
the word of encouragement, is sadly
needed at times, and you can’t say
too many. One man writes: “I
would rather do without the necessa
ries of life than miss a single number
of the Jeffersonians.”
Mr. John Terrell, of Atlanta, says:
“I do not want to miss any num
bers. I am having them bound for
my library. I have carefully treas
ured up every number, beginning
with the Tom Watson Magazine, pub
lished in New York. Mr. Watson
shall have an order soon for all of
his published works. I have read
them and shall teach my children to
revere the author and study his great
books.”
Mr. Mercer J. Bruce, of Norwood,
Ga., enjoys reading both Jefferson
ians. “They should be in every
home,” he says. “Success to their
founder and promoter. He is, I
think, the greatest living American.”
Here is another: “I have been a
subscriber and reader of the Jeffer
sonians since the first issue, and I
have done what I could to get others
to read and subscribe by giving out
all my papers and magazines to my
neighbors. John M. Buster, Martha,
Ark.”
These are fair samples of our sub
scription letters, and since the result
of the election was known, the note
Tlkffersonlan
of encouragement is even stronger
than before. Many have already gone
to work to find ways and means to
reorganize the party. The cry is,
“On! On! the truth can never
die.”
Numbers of subscribers to the
Weekly Jeffersonian are taking ad
vantage of the reduction of the Mag
azine ’s price from $1.50 to sl. If you
have not seen a late copy of the Mag
azine, send for one, and we will take
pleasure in mailing it. It is a maga
zine of the South, by the South, for
the South. The brilliant essays and
political articles by Mr. Watson, the
finely illustrated Survey of the
M orld, the bright fiction, the origi
nal cartoons, the poetry, the Home
Department, all make the Jefferson
ian Magazine as lively as a Southern
“shivaree,” as thoughtful as the
Southern pines, as full of pure de
light as a Southern night in June.
One other point about the Maga
zine. Mr. Watson will re-commence
his History of the Life and Times of
Andrew Jackson in the January
number. Just at this critical time in
the history of the great political par
ty with which Jackson is identified,
Mr. Watson’s history is a document
of singular importance.
Our subscribers, and particularly
our agents, will please to bear in
mind the need for accuracy in the
spelling of names and addresses. A
few weeks ago, one of our agents sent
in a long list of subscribers at the
town of Wrens, Ga. After awhile we
received some complaints from par
ties at Rentz, Ga., that they were
not getting their papers. We could
not find that they had ever sub
scribed, and when we came to in
quire into the matter closely, we dis
covered that the agent had misspelled
the name of the town.
An important part of the address
is the rural route. Quite often a
subscriber neglects to give us the
number of his rural route, and the
papers are held at the local post of
fice. If you don’t get your ..paper in
two weeks after sending in your sub
scription, write to us about it. If
the label on your paper or magazine
does not show a change in date two
weeks after you have renewed your
subscription, let us know. We all
make mistakes, but x if you will help
us out, we will not make many, and
those that are made will be correct
ed as quickly as possible.
You will see that we have added
a couple of premiums to our list, and
they are both good and easily ob
tained. One is a pair of eight-inch
adjustable shears, which are made so
that they can be tightened up and
never lose their cutting edge, and the
other is a large volume on “Practical
Fanning and Gardening,” 500 pages,
well printed and bound, and written
by experts in each department.
Before you lay aside this week’s
paper, read over the list of Mr. Wat
son’s books. If there are any that
you wish to read, let us know, and
we will tell you how you can easily
earn them. If you will work for us

Financial Depressions
Periodical financial depressions distress
the country. We call them inevitable; are
they? Is there no cure? Is not the debtor
—many simply in panic to pay the creditor
—few ?
The Remedy
is given in “Usury; from a Scriptural, Eth
ical and Economic Standpoint,” in which
great book, for the first time in years, logic,
religion, theory and practice are so united
as to demonstrate convincingly that
Usury
is the cause of our recent and every finan
cial distress. The author, Rev. J. C. Elli
ott, strikes heavy blows on present systems.
Interest is the curse of business morality
and business practice.
