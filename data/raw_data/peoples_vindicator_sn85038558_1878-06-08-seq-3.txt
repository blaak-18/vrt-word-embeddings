of the Lottery, makes it a penal offence
to sell other than Louisiana State Lot- itg int

Lottery; it deprives persons charged
with selling such tickets of the privilege lies, i
of trial by jiury; and it deprives them,
when sent to prison, of the benefit of NE
the habes otanpus.
And now look fiurther.
1st Since his establishment in ovice,
the Governor of the State has never ut
tered one syllable otlicialty agaimstanys Raoon
monopoly in the State-not even against
the Louisiana State Lottery, in relation
to which the above exhibition is imade. nE
2d1. The Legislature of the State voted I tee
down every proposition to disturb the meet a
status of the Lottery, and the coummon
t and ftlagrant languiage of the street and
the lobby was, that the Lottery had pur Eve
r chased a quorum for the Legislature, mattel
-and thalt consequently the latter could transa
not "go hack on" the Lottery.

Sfound the active and superserviceable
tool of the Lottery-even going so far
I- as to be the active instrument in effeet
, ing the arrest of one of the Magistrates
ýof the city for doing his duty.
4th. Another Magestrate, Recorder of
thie First District, has prostituted his
office to the point of re-arresting a man ti0
f charged with selling Havana Lottery Ma,
tickets, but legally and formally die
charged by the Recorder of the Second Jc
District.

to nal Court has actually denied and tried
o to over-ride the writ of habeas corpus is
