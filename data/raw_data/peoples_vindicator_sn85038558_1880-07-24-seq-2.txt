The omluatlon of leneral Hanceck.
The letter in which General Han
cock was yesterday oficlally notified
of his nomination states clearly the
claims wbich that gentleman has
upon the votes of his fellow-citizens.
The Presidency Is not a reward for
military. service. When properly
bestowed it is not a reward for any.
thing. It Is a trust, and the only
"claWm" which any man can ever be
said to have upon it must arse out
of evidence to show that he will be
likely to administer it better than
othermen. General Hancock is on
ly one of the three. or four most Ii
lsttlous soldiers of the olivil war
still before the public, biut of those
soldiers he is the one who after the
close of the war showed himself most l
clearly to possess the first requisite
for civic trusts In his apprelcation of
the true nature of constitutional
government and of the relation of
the army t the State. He is honor
ed by Democrats because, to adopt
the admirable language of a letter
writtid the other day by General
E0Oleloan, he "did so muhoo to Insure
the suceas of the war, knew so
well what It was for and perceived so
clearly when It was over." By no
other name more effectually than by
that of General Hancock could the
Democrats have siglnified n the
holoce of their candidate their pur
pose to make an end of "the section
al lssue." Poor General Garfield,
after saying with perfect truth nla his
place In Congress that any politician
who now attempts to get lnto power
on the sectional Issue will find blm.
self without a followlng, sees him.
self compelled tin his letter of accept

THE TWO PLATFORMS.
A Criticals Review by Great lade- 1
dependent Newslpaper.
INew York Hrr.idl.•
Whatever mo v be sl I fLInst, the
Dtumocratic Ilatforu it. e jn,,, b1
denied that it i' an hIouest. nd hli
aines like document, and in this
respect it. is very unlike the bragging
and blustering Republlcan platform.
There are. undoubtedly, a great many
voters to whom the Democrat!e prop.
ositions will be sawelcome; voters
wito do not like free shimo; voters
who are opposed to a tariff for rev
enue; voters who want more subut
dies and who will, therefore, dislike
the bemocratie declaration that the i
taxes shall be spent only for publl c
and not for private objects. But it
is the great merit of the Democratic
platform that It says something;
that It proposes reforms to whicb
those who have benefited by old
abuses will of course object, but
which will relieve and benefit the
people; that it courageously strikes
at monopolists, subsidy mongers
and jobbers. Naturally monopolists,
jobbers and subsidy mongers do not
like it; but then it was scarcely to
be expected that they would. These
classes, who wish to live on the tax.
payers as they have long done, pre
fer the Republican platform, and
they are right. That platform has
nothing in It distasteful to them.
Where the Republioan leaders did
not think it prudent to encourage
monopoly they cautiously said noth
oing, and their platform leaves the
door open to all the abuses, the ex
travagance and reckless waste of the
taxes which characterized Repubit.
can legislation before the people put
the Democrats in control of the
House of Representatives.
It is often said that platforms mean
nothing; but in the present instance
it happens that the national plat.
forms represent pretty accurately
the spirit of the two partles. The
Republican platform looks backward.
the Demooratle platform looks ahead.
The Republican platform deals in
and appeals to old and mischievous
sectional issues; the Democratic
platform, though not perfect, is yet
thoroughly national and not section.
al in its spirit. The Republican
platform favors or encourages mo
nopolies; the Demooratic platform
favors the taxpayers--the people.
We have spoken of the Demoorat
Ic platform as an honest and bus-.
ness-like document, and one proof of
this Is that though much shorter
than that of the Republicans it con
tins all that is good and pertinent
Sn that and a great deal more besides.
The Republicans in a cumbrous par
agraph speaks for free education, and
in another, equally cumbrous and
verbose, for separation of Church
Sand State. The Democrats cover the
same ground in one energetic and
clear sentence, demanding "separa.
tion of Church and State for the
good of each, and common schools
fostered and protected." The Ro
I publicans talk vaguely of p'rotecting
the liberties of all; the Democrats
boldly declare that "the right of a
free hllot is the right preservative
of all rights, and must and shall be
maintained In every part of the
United States." We have looked for
t some other points for comparison,
but the Republican platform does
not afford them. It is weak, shallow
I wordy, purposely vague, and would
I make the fathers of the party blush
I with anger If they could read it in
their graves; for those men-the
Bumners, Andrews, Olddlgs, Love
SJos-were not accustomed to the
I mining gaait and cautious verbosity
of their eccesesors.
The Republioans declare that
S"eommeree should be steadily en
f coumraged." which may mean any
I thig or nothing; the Democrats de
I clae manfully for "free ships and a
living chance for American oom
' merce on the seas and on the land,"
I wlbhich means something definite.
.IThe Republloans say timidly that
"the credit acquired should never be
SImpaired ;" the Demoorats declare
for "honest monoy sad the strlit
I malntenance of the publi faith,
State and national " which covers
the whole grouad without hesiation
or timidity, The Republicans say Io
I one motion that "the reviving I
Sduostries should be further promoted,"
and in nother, lower down, that
"the duties levied for the purpose of
revenue sboauld so disemluae as to
favor American labor," which may
Smean anrthing, and was evidently
written In the hope that it might
catch In one net the Protectioanists of
SPennsylvania and the Free Trade
I farmers of Illinois and the North
, west generlally. It holds out a shad
,owy promise to both. The Demo.
erats declare for "a tarlff for reveaue
: only; public money and public cred.
SIt for publi purposes msolely," anad
! the party "pledges tself to protect
the worklngman alike agaiest the

Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock, United s
Statesarmy, commanding the Fifth I
Military District, Texas and Louis- I
lans, offered me, and I accepted, the I
important and confidential position c
of attorney at his headquarters in
New Orleans. When I reported for I
duty in December, 186t, cases of I
nearly every description, and some I
very serious ones, arose in the wide a

it was the only desire of that brave,

EXECUTION OF CHASTINE COX.
Iefeetual Efforts to Secure Execu.
tire Clemeney-eenes at the
Ncaffold.
NEW YORK, July 1(;.-Cox passed a I
quitl night, retiring between 11 and
12 and falliog into a deep slumber be
fore 2 o'clock. His counsel and
friends w,.re unremitting yesterday_
in their efforts to procure a stay of
proceedings, watlns upon Gov. Cor.
nell, who is in the city, and continu
ing t'heir labors until a late bour. At
11:57 a message was received at the
Toombs bearing the fatal words:
"The Governor refuses to interfere."
At a few minutes past 5 o'clock Cox
awakened and quietly rose from his
bed. He did not exhibit the slight
est degree of fear of any kind. He1
spoke to no one but Was aiesorbed
and probably engaged li mental
prayer. He seemed to be under no
religious excitement and was out
wardly calm, self-possessed and even
cheerful. At 5:30 he called Deputy ,
Arrons and requested him to notify
Rev. Mr. Cooke that he was ready to
receive him and Mr. Cooke went into,
his cell. He mot him at the door
and shook bands with him oordially.
After the religious exercises, Cox ate
breakfast. and then more prayers
were said until the arrival of the
sheriff and his deputies. About 8
o'clook Cox was taken from his cell
to the gallows. The way was up a
corridor to the entrance of the court
yard directly under the "Bridge of
sighs" Sheriffl Bowe and Under
Sheriff Stevens came first. Then
followed Cox, with Reverends Dre.
Russell, Stewart, Cooke, law and
HBetor. The black asp was on the
head of the condemned man and the
fatal noose dangled from his neck.
Bls arms were pinioned at the el
bows. He walked with a firm step
and composed demeanor. As the
processlon neared the gallows he
looked a it it with seeming coolnaes,
then his eyes dropped and his lips
moved in prayer. As hie took his
station beneath the cross-piece the
noose was then.hooked into the pen
dant rope and the black cap drawn
over his face. One of the ministers
talked to the condemned man in a
low tone and continued until moe.
tioned to retire. Heretofore a plat
form or floor for the culprit to stand
upon has always been laid. This
time the doomed man stood upon
Belgian pavement, with which the
yard Is laid. There was only an nlo
stant of suspense. When the execu.
tioner went behind the door at the
end of the gallows he was signaled
by the sheriff and cut with an axe
the cord holding a heavy weight.
The condemned man rose four feet
simultaneously with tile sound
of the axe and than with a rebound
he fell back. Then ensued contor
tions of the body and contractions of
muscles usual in cases of death bi
strangulation. A minute later and
these ceased. Shortly after all was
still. The coroner's jury had been
sworn an and after a brief inquest
the body was removed by the under
taker. The funeral took place last
Sunday from the colored church on
Fifteenth satreet.
A TERRIBLE TRAGEDT.
A Fight Ia a Church sad Two Hen
Killed.
A gentleman who arrived in this
city last night from Baton Rouge
gives the particulars of a terrible
tragedy which was enacted twelve
miles from that place on Sunday
morning.
Two young men, Oharles and Nor
ris Barnes, cousins, some days pre.
oelon the affair of Sunday morning
quarreled about amlly matters. A
dificulty was at the time prevented,
but a reoonciliation was not effected.
On 8unday morning the two young
men met at church while the 8ab.
bath school was in session, both
armed with shotguns, and the quar.
tel was renewed and I• a few mo
ments enulmiuated in a dilieaulty
which resulted in the killln of two
persons and the wounding o! several
others.
The gentleman from whom this In
formation was obtained stated that
bothCharles and Morris used their
shotguns. Oharles Barnes and the
ministter of the church, whose name
is said to have been Townsend. were
killed, the father of Morris larnes
was shot throuth both arms, the
sister of Morris Barnes was shot in
the thigh, and a young man, teacher
of oneof the classes In the Sabbath
shool, was dangerosly wounded.
