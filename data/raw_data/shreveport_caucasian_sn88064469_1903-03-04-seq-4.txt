THE VALLEY QUEEN
Struck a Bar near Hardscrabble Land- CC
ing and Burned to the Water's
Edge. tl
A special to the Picayune dated Vicks- m
burg, Miss., March I, says: The steamer of
Valley Queen was burned to the water's st
edge at 3:30 this morning at or near
Hardscrabble Landing, La., some miles
below St. Joseph, La., and is reported to
be a total loss, but without injury to
any one on board.
The Valley Queen left here early yes
terday morning with about 47o bales of
cotton, added about Zoo more bewteen
here and Bondurant, all of which is re
ported lost.
The particulars received have been i
very meager, and no details as to the P3
origin of the fire has been obtained' so
far.
It appears that late last night the boat V
had struck a bar below Bondurant,
where she remained, unable to float off
of her own power. Captain L Brunner, '
jin command of the boat, telegraphed his
agent here to send a tug and barge in
order to lighten up his boat. At day
night the agent received a second mes- t6
sage, containing information of the
bq~t's total loss, and countermanding the is
irer order. -
..The,.Valley Queen was a fine freight
;, ;with a capacity of about 4,ooo bales A
of otton, and was formerly run in the
Red and OQuahita rivers. She was own- N

An Early Norman Dinner.
The Saxon dinner arrangements were
orderly compared with those of the
early Normans, when the halls and
passages were frequently the scene of
a free fight betw-een the servants bring
ing in the food and the crowds of hang
ers on endeavoring to snatch it from
them. This nuisance became at length
so intolerable that ushers of the hall
and kitchen were established by King
William Rufus to protect not only the
cooks bringing in the dinner, but the
guests arriving to partake of it. Upon
the occasion of his great feast at West
minster 300 of these oficers were on
duty, some to guard the visitors as
they ascended the steps and others to
defend the threatened dishes.
Such was tihe uncivilized state of so
ciety at this period, but when later on
the marauders disappeared from the
great houses it became customary to
carry in the dishes in procession, some
times preceded by music and headed
by the steward with his wand of office.
It was the dity of an "nasseeur" or
placer to arrange them upon the table;
the ewers and napkins with which to
perform t~eir ablutions were present
ed to the guests by the esqufres and
pages, while it fell to the lot of the al
moner to say grace.
A Great Feast.
There has never been prepared at
any feast a bigger bowl of punch than
that which was brewed by the Right
Hon. Edward Russell when he was
captain general and commander in
chief of the forces in the Mediterra
nean seat It was made in a fountain
In a garden in the middle of four
walks, all covered overhead with
lemon and orange trees. In every walk
there was a table 4.e whole length of
it, and on every table was a cold colla
tion. In the huge fountains were the
following ingredients: Four hogsheads
of brandy, eight hogsheads of water,
25,000 lemons, twenty gallons of lime
juice, 1,300 pounds of- fine Lisbon
sugar, five pounds of grated nutmegs,
300 toasted biscuits and a pipe of dry
mountain Malaga.
Over the fountain was placed a great
canopy, while in the midst of this lake
of liquor there sailed a little sailor boy
who filled the cups and replenished the
glasses of all those who had a desire
to drink. More than 6,000 men put in
an appearance at this feast.-London
Tit-Bits.
Desperate Battle.
New Orleans, March 4.-Passengers
arriving here on the steamer Break
water say that a desperate battle was
fought between Hondfiras troops and
revolutionists under the leadership of
Lee Christmas, an American. The bat
tie was fought at Mant. Out of 200
men under Christmas, sixty were kill
ed and 100 wounded. It was a fright
fiul slaughter. On the government
side one colonel and four officers were
killed with" a heavy casualty list. The
exact number -t not known.
Payiesg a Canl In htina.
A Chinese bride called upon a foreign
lady, says a missionary. On entering
the room she deliberately turned her
back upon her hostess and made an
elaborate obeisance. Of course the for
eign lady was amazed and annoyed,
but she found out the. reason of the
strange proceeding afterward. The
bride's conduct had conformed to Chi
asee etiquette.
She had perfr' ishtleance, her
k'o-t'-ou, to th.. ee rise that Is
the direetion of the royal abode. If the
foreign lady was w---gnorant as to
stand on the south side of the room,
that was not the bride's coneea. She
knew, if her hostess dld-ot, in what
direction to bow ther head.
Betole Oysters.
In "Social Life In the Reign of Queen
Anne" Swift writes to Stella, "Lord
Masham made me go home with him to
eat boiled oysters," and then he oblig
ingly adds the recipe: "Take oysters,
wash them clean; that is, wash their.
shells clean; then put your oysters In
an earthr- pot, with their hollow side
A.own; then put this pot, covered, into
a great kettle of water and let it boil.
Your oysters are then boiled in their
own liquor and do not mix with wa
ter." r -_
Tb. Great questioe.
"We are to be made one," she sug
"Yes," he'replied.
"But which one?" she sked.
And In the attempt to settle that
question another promising matrlmo
nial future was spoiled, for woman is
not so unassuming'in these days;as she
was once uipon a time--Cheago Pest.
A Deceittful Cat.
Mamma-You wicked little girl to
say that the poor cat has eaten the
jam, when t can see the stain of it on
your faee!
Winnie-So It was pussyl She stole
th.e, Jam;. and after she'd eaten it she
started i.cking my face to make people
think I'd one it
.he Carbuanese.
One of the rarest and most precious
stes lsi the cqrbuncle, which is some
times confounded with the ruby, from
which it dtifers by the intensity of its
-fres, produced by an internal luster of
gold, while under the purple of the run
by theri~ oniyappear dottings of azure
or Ielacqer. Ethiopia produced the
most PI*reous ancient carbuncles. The
C.haldeansý regarded this stone as a
powerf-u tali man. Legend makes the
eyes of dragons out of carbuncles. Gar
cfB g dBo*to, physician-of one of the
viceroys of India, speaks of carbuncles
which ho saw to the palace of that
prate whi±: were so extraordinary in
tmonir btlianey that they seewed "like
