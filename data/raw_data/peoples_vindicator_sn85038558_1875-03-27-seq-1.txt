[Coliti>ned.] safe
[Ilanded unto the Clerk without rep
reading.) t
This is another article against what me
they call the Iron.Greys, or salt and
pepper politicians, requiring them to ce
take sides, appearing on the 29th of A
August 1874, in the Natchiteches Vian. J4
dicator. Then, July 25th, two days the
before the mass meeting of 7th July, the
the following additional appeared in not
that paper, relative to the State of c
excitement in the community at that ped
time (handed to the Clerk). And
here are several extracts in regard to tra
the organization of the~White League,
preparilng for the canvas and she the
election, (handed to the Clerk.) Am
Here is another relative to calling am
ward meetings for the purpose of or
ganizing this organization. I gave
them to you as I got them; I was not
present at any of their meetings. tw
Here is another on the same subject; deC
here is an article upon the officials of I
stating if they returned to the parish the
what steps are to be taken. Here is riec
one in regard to ward 11, and 53
white citizens. Here is a card signed Q
by Prudhomnme and othem, denying Q:
that statement. Here are articles mil
plblisled in July, 1874, and in An- J
gust 1st, relative to the formation of 1
the White League organization. Here
is an extract relative to furnishing het
certificates to colored men who voted
the White League ticket.
Q. Did you ever see any of these ? cia
A. No. It is only telling them to
call on certain people to get them.
Here is another article relative to the on
organization ; and here is one rela
tive to taxes and to the payment of tim
taxes. Here is one giving the names thi
of the Committee ot Seventy for the
parish of Natchitoches. This is all
I have. (All the extracts were hand- mI
ed to the Clerk.)
Q. By Mr. Frye.--How long have abH
you lived up there?
A. In the parish, only about fifteen na
years.
Q. You are pretty well acquainted kil
with the people there? twf
A. I know a good many there, and pol
there are a good many there I don't vol
know, that is, there are some I don't
know.
Q. Were the colored people regis- thi
r. tered there to the full extent of their
number ha
A. At this last election I was not an;
there, but according to the registra
tion, I should judge they were not.
Q. How much do they lack t
A. I think about 400.
h . How many colored men voted ed
the Democratic ticket f
A. That I cannot tell, I was not th
there on the day of election; I am of qu
the opinion that if things remained
as when I left, I don't think there th
were a great-mlany.
Q. as there any of them that vo
ted the Democratic ticket from free an
will t
A. I Inow five or six that would do
(. so ; I do not know any beyond that.
Q. How 'long before the election
did you leave theret W
A. I think I left on the 27th of Ja
ly ra
Q. Why did you not stay at home ? u
A. I did not think it was safe to go a
back. I learned that part from gen- Pl
tlemen belonging to the Democratio
's party.. I don't know whether they W
belong to anlly organization. I got w
to letters from there, and was told so
or in person, and I thought I had bet. d
ter take their advice.
Q. Did yeou actually remain away V
because yen were afraid? tI
11 A. I certainly did; all I have got 51
he he there.
heQ. You have not booeen at bome P
aines t d
A. .No, str.

i A.,I have b~cen threatened through P
the papers there, ann I have talked s'
w ith several persons who advised me h
not to go back. t.
SQ, Who is Supervisor of Registra
tion there? ' ,
A. P. W. Holmes, was appIoitel
first, but I think Mr. Fzernack was
appointed in his place.
q. Was the first one tamed ont ? P
A. B.was removed, by Gov. Kel

A. Nd, I think not . . I
Q. What is the spirit npanifested C
there towards white Ieplubipans t
SA. Up.to the time of this meeting
in July, I don't think there was any
danger for a white repnublican staying
there. There was of course social
ostracism; that I mnet repeatedly,
but,I never heard any. trouble tihete
with any one; no one had qy thing
to do wthlr me Wlio formerly did.

Q. Had it not been safe for you to (
go back there .'
A. I think it would not have been I
safe for me to go back. I got letters wit
repeatedly from gentlemen, not of ha
the same politics with me, advising 2
me not to go back.
Q. Are there any Republican ol
cers in the parish now Sta
A. No, only the Parish Judge, who set
Just returned home, and I believe lam
there is a letter in town stating that rec
the members of the liar has agreed the
not to practice before him. the
Q. So that the law business is stop- Oct

A. Yes, except before the Magia- no
trate's Court. poi
Q. Do you know what the vote of Iee
the parish was? into
A. I cannot tell you. The registratioi PICI
amounted, I believe, to 3666, of which licei
1386 were whites and 2280 colored. into
Q. Who carried the day wit
A. That is a matter of contest* be- Aft
tween both parties. The Democrats am
declare to have carried the election tifi
of Parish Judge by eight votes, and to 1
the Republicans claim to have car- (ce
ried it by twenty-six. ten
So it was very close any way by
Yes! (
Q. By thp Chairman.-Who deter- mo
mined the election of the Parish i
Judge? (
A. The Returning Beard. bei
Q. This same Returning Board j
here ? we
A. Yes. out
Q. And the Republican was de- pet
clared elected t sue
A. Yes. wel
Q. By Mr. Frye.-Was there any sib
outrage which you were cognizant I bet
A. I know of none. Up to the can
time I left since 1866, there were
thirty persons killed. the
Q. Generally colored ?
A. I can inform you of that fact in a to
minute. C. W. Stauffer was killed; qui
the reason, I don't know anything ecll
about. til
Q. I don't care anything about att
namest ju
A. I will give you the colored men thn
killed as far as I know. There are for
twenty-two that I coueant killed for tle
political reasons or on account of Th
color. "w
Q. Twenty-two colored men i tw
A. Yes, there are thirty-three or the
thirty-four altogether. sel
Q. Do you know whether anybody
has been convicted and punished for 1
any of these murders? tin
A. There have been four persons ha
tried; I think they were all acquit- St
ted.
Q. So that nobody has been punish- St
Sed for any of them t
A. No, they, these four, passed, of
t throng regular trial and the jury ac- fi
f quitted them.
i Q. Where there some negro es hung in
that were not tried tdh
A. Negroes hung h ti
Q. Did'at they hang some negroes all
- up there
A. What time
Q. Any time t J?
A. ~ o, sir, pot to my knowledge. sa
SQ. Where the colored men alarmed BI
when you left ?
- Yes, they appeared to be; this was F,
rather a sadden movement; it sprung wl
I up suddenly. It was suspected that of
o something of the kind would take
place, but it sprung up suddenly.
SSome of the colored men came to tb
Sask me what was the matter; what
t were all themse people coming to town tli
o for at this large meeting f I really o,
. did not know myself.
Q. Then this organization of the
White Leaue and the overthrow of 01
the oieia was somethiig that w
Sspraung up suddenly ls
A. There was some notice given fr
a prior to that meeting, seven or eight I,
days, asking or calling a wseetlag to ri
repel the Republican oleers, alleging de
charge against them. Some of theses
h parties were found in Red River par- s
& ash. I 4on't know why they sould
, have been found there. The people
there were not ertaily interested.
S Q. Yea said something about your
people nat paying parish aes? j l
J A. The town i. ~zempt by law
s from parish taxatin. 1
Q. Do yo kngoW't what is the po
pulation of yoar parish about? 1
d A. I think according to the census
of 1870~, it was eighteen or nineteen a
thousand. But since that time al
large number of colored men have 7
come in from Sabine and some from a
thelower end "of Desoto and some t
,from Win; bat I could et ts you

increased. t
Ql . How many sehool bouses are
there in your pruh b
SA. The irst school was organised
in September, 1871.
SQ.Did you have aroy school slne 1
1871
A. No, ri, not in operatioen. There
was a school beard appointed but
ithere wasu no school+ Thire had been i
three or four in the parish; they
taught there four or five months and
then qauit. Ithink that waes in 18710.
Q. How many school houses are
there now ?
A. We started there with flfteen
t achoolfrom March 80, 1871, to March
31, 1872; an on Septemnber 80th
there were twenty-three schools. For
7 December, 1873, there were twenty
on four chools, uand they hlave been
s averaging from that time, I suppose,
fifteen anyhow.

Q. I lave you not henard from some die
witnesses that you were chalrg-ed wirth pi
having plundered the school board. the
A. Yes. wit
Q. lHave yon done so led
A. I have the only evidence in the not
State that I think is authorized to S;a
settle that matter. 1 will explain the flue
law relative to this point. The law be
recites: '"That it shall he the duty of as 1
the Division Sunperintendent to visit lies
the diffelrent parishes by the 1st of thin
October, at least once a year, and itol
adjust the '~Ieasurer's accounts ; and
no Treasurer shall be released of res- are
oeMnsibity v unless his acounts have A
been adjusted by the Division Super
intendent or by the Superintentlent of lecd
Publice Education. I have a certi- mu
licat hete front the office of the Super. A
intendent of Public Education and of tail
which I shall file an official copy. ree
After examination of the whole thiu
amount in Decem be 1874, this cer
tificate was issued. N would desire mu
to furnish an official copy of that A
(certificate of W. H. Brown, Superin
tendent of Public Education, as read ant
by witness.)
Q. Did you hold any office where .1 tl
money was deposited with yotu I sm:
A. I held none except that one. sin
Q. They di not charge you with 4
being a defau ter in any otlice f
A. I admit that such complaints bat
were made, ajid I endeavored to find ins
out whether they came fron persons 4
pecuniarily re ible so that I could a h
sue them ; bum I think these charges tar
were made bll persons not respou- A
sible in damages. Whether they had me
been instrusted to do so or not, I the
cannot tell. tha
Q. By Mr. Frye.-Can you tell me 4
the per capital tax for all purposes am
A. I anu glad you call my attention the
to that. The law of this State re pie
quires and provides a penalty if the )
school board omits to furnish an es- to
timate for school purposes. It also dil
attaches a penalty to each police cot
juror who fails to smake a levy of Jul
that tax within ninety days. There- sat
fore, the estimates are governed by lee
the police jury who levied the tax. we
That tax was collected, but the tax you
was never used. I was Treasurer of ed,
two boards, but in no instance was
the school tax collected used for bet
school purposes.
Q. Where is that tax?
A. It is there subject to the order of jul
the Treasurer of the scool board ; but $0
having got sufficient means from the $4
State we did not regnire that. TI
, Q. A portion of the revenue of the thil
State is for school purposes t
A. I think there are two millions
of dollars appropriated by the State
for school purposes. pI
Q. Do yeou know anything that you ex
have done in your official position ox
that would have these people to oes
tracise you and drive you off, and
charge you with corruption in office I m
A. I was Parish Judge from 1870 to tei
March 1874. I have been District
Judge one term, and I think I could co
safely refer to the members of the Ju
Bar in that District, although op. or
posed to me politically, that in no tal
Instance cari they point to any act wu
where I used my otece in the interest de
of any manr or any political party.
Q. Or yourself oi
A. Or Mpyself. I reversed myself in
thoeso auits where I was a party.
Q. You don't know anytthing then la
that you have done, either as ajudge,
or in the school board to cause that to
treatment p
A. I do not. I1lways, in rendering
opinions in court, rendered thema in
writing, giving my reasons and tlhe he
haw so than any gentlemen could see
from what I based my judgment. If hi
Ierred in my judgement, they had a
Iright to appeal. I don't think 1 ren
Sdered any decision without I gave
Msome written reasons; without it was t 1
Ssomne trifling ease.
I Q. Were any appeals taken I b
SA. Very few.
Q. By Mr. Zacharie.- You said
! something about the registration of
1872 ? •
r A. No, notlhing about the election of0
187I.
- Q. How does the registratiop of a
1874 compare with that of 1872
i A. Well, sir, in 1872, the republi
a eans according to the returns of the Ii
! Democratic supervisor, were, I think, t
s 750 in the parish, at, Mlr. PieraPn told *
a me. There were 10 Rlepubiices vo.
o ters at one poll in the city of Natehi. I
a tochesi thatdid not 'vote. Their af- I
n Aldavits were taken and I believe
thqre were some 700 more it the par- (
! ih,. I think there were' 1200 aflida- t
d Q. They were not allowed to vote i
A. I think tile number of men that I
- have their certifieates of Registratiou t
was 1950, who did not vote. They 1
Stvoted750.
t iQ. What was the tax of your par
in lh before 1868?4
my A. I cannot tell you.
l Q. About?
Ia A. It is ilmpossible for me to tell.
e I was not living iu the city of Nachi
toches then.
m Q. I am asking you about tlhe rate?
th A. The rate of 1869 mast have
Lb governed, because they levied the
or tax one year and collected the next.
y Q. What hias been the actual ex
en penses of yeaour parish in round nurm
e, bers
A. ThIe whole expeonses on an aver
n age, I think, about $4000, some years
it has been larger.
U Q. Do you mean includinug these
is; judgment taxes and all i
Ie A. The judgment tax is kept seps
As rate.
.l* Q. How much of that money has
gone lito the Parish Treasury I
A. I don't know that tLheore ,ever
was any money in the Parish Tresu-I
Itr y.
e Q. Was not the money, collected to
re pay judgment debts, gone into the
re. Parish Treasury
Is A. That question went up to the
tle Supreme Court. The tar collector
failed to pay that money into the
Tre.asry: hle assmued this position:
that the pIarih had no right to ban
die the monesy collected to pay the
plaintif. ''hat question went up tol
the Supreme Coin t. lie was chargeil
with the full amounut that lie had col
lected, and the parish that lie had
not paid this into the Treasury. The
S;iprenle Court decided that it was a
question whether this money was to
be paid to the plrish or not; bat in
as much as the parish haid been re
lieved of its debt to the extent of
this money paid to the judgment cred
itors, it did not make any difference.
Q. About how much has the taxes
averaged iunce 18t191
A. About 141 mills, State tax.
Q. I mean the money actually col
lected. I would like to know how
much the parish has spuent
A. I don't think that can be nscer
tained, for this reason: The parish
records have been examined twice for
this purpose.
Q. Don't you know about how
much 9
A. I can't make any estimate.
Q. Has it been a small or large
amount f
A. The amount has beenincreasing.
I think the first tax since 1868 was
small, and it has been increasing
since.
Q. Year by year I
A. Yes, some years it would drop
back; you can notice that and in some
instances it has increased up to 1874.
Q. Have they collected every year
a large amount in money, judgment
tax and all ?
A. I don't think they collected
money frome the parish tax, because
the Polise Jury received warrants for
that.
Q. If they issued warrants that
amounted to cash, how much have
they received, and what has the peo
ple to show for it f
A. I don't think that can be given
to you correctly. The expenses, or
dinary expenses in 1873 and 1874,
court expenses included, and Police
Jury amounted to about six thou
sand dollars. Now you must recol
lect a large amount of back taxes
were being collected, which prevents
you from telling how much is collect
ed.
Q. In addition to what money has
been collected, I understand you to
say there is a debt of $66,000
A. I say that there is a debt for
judgments against the parish for
$66,000, with a delinquent list of
$4000 more than enough to pay.
There may be some new judgments,
that I do not know.
Q. flow itach do they amount to I
A. I don't know.
Q. For this $66,000 what has the
people of that parish got to show,
I except the payment of their ordinary
expenses ?
A. I cannot tell you.
Q. Have there been any improve
ments made there to any great ex
tent e
A. No. You must take this into
consideration, that this tax to pay
judgments has nothing to do with the
ordinary tax. If you have any capi
tal to invest and are able to buy them
warrants, you can get youear money,
dollar for dollar, by taxation.
Q. How did those warmaats get
out
A. I cannot tell yon what they
were all issued for; about 6000 dol
lars for court expenses.
Q. Then these pecople have nothing
to ahow for that debt, except the
payment of their ordinary expenses
A. I don't know.

housest
A. The Parish don't build school
f houses.
SQ. Have they built any bridges t
SA. I don't kuow to what extent.

been a member of tihe Police Jury I
might.
