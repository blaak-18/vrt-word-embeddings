was essential, but deep ploughing and a
good deal of it saved tne munly bushels of

have had snftlcient rain for cotton though
the cool weather has kept it from grow- t

thirty bushels per acre. I put them in

thatt crops generally are not good, and r
inie is better than any they have seen

e THE MANSFIELD FEMALE COLLEGE
e Examinlation and Commencememt Ex.

Hill Take the Medal-A Gay
Throng of Visitors from
Abroad.
'IThe annual ,examinaton exercises
-of ore of the tinest Institutions in
the South for the education of yo,,nll
ladies, known as the "Mansfield Fe
male College," took place on the 20th
at Mansfield. The following synop
t sis we clip, frrm the Democrat: "On
Sunday the commencemnent sermon
y was preached at the Meth'dist Church
by Rev. Robt. Kandle. The concerts
on Monday and Tuesday nights were
1 largely attended, and the young Ia
dies gave evidence that the musical
department of the Institution was in
I competent hands, and Miss Bettie
Scott the Music Teacher, should feel
gratified at the progress and accomn,
plishurents of her pupils.
Commencement day, the great
event of the year in Mansfield, wit
I nessed the gathering of a very large
number of visitors from Keachi,
Plei.sant Hill, Coushatta, Shreveport,
Natchitoches, Bossier and New Or
leatns, with a considerable sprinkling
of persanm from other parishes and
the neighboring States. The Rev.
Mr. Hart, of Bossier; opened the pro
ceedings with an earnest and eloqulnt
prayer, which was followed by mu
sic. The petfonmer, Miss Violet
Laths, of Natchitoches, surely Con.
vinced all that she was skilled in the
science of Imusic.
The annual address was then de.
livered by Rev. J. T. Danes, of
. Shreveport. It was a very clear, ap
pr-.priate and eloquent speech and
was well received by the audience,
and evidently highly appreciated by
the young ladies of the graduating
cia s.
Miss Belle Taylor, of Mansfield.
She read clearly and her essay con
vinced her hearers that ahe was an
accomplished scholar.
Miss Alice Sutherlin, of Mansfield
was then introduced to the audience;
her theme was, "The Conquest of the
East by Russia," and right, skillfully
did she handle the subject. Her elo
cution was good, and her essay was
roundly a ,landed.
Miss Hattie O'Pry, of Pleasant Hill,
was the next to speak. She had se
lected the beautiful subject, "Natnre
and Her Works." She spoke exceed
ingly well, and her essay was really
an excellent and beautiful composi
tion.
Miss Willie Ricks, of this place
came next. She had selected for her
theme, the novel subject: "My Es
say, and Whlat it Cost Me." It was
well written, well delivered, and in
fact, was highlly appreciated by her
hearers.
Miss Bertie Fields, the Valedieto
rian, was introduced, and in a mott
eloquent manner addressed the audi
ence, Her elouention was superior in
deed, and her effort is considered one
of thle best ever heard in this well
known Institution; and this ia truly
saying maoti in its favor, when it is
remembered that the Mansfeld Fe
male College has turned out many of
the most brilliant women that hls
ever graced the soceiety of Louisiana.
The Diplomas were then presented
to each of the five tgrduates by the
President, but owing to the late hour,
and muchl to the regret of those pres
ent, he omitted hie usual beautiful
and eloquent parting address to the
graduates.
ThIe Benediction'was then said by
Rev. Mr. Stayton, of Coushatta, and
the session was at an end.
The Pistol.
A terrible tragedy occurred in the quiet
little village of Pleasant Hill on thie 29th
between two young gentlemen well
known in social cireles, namely, Mr. Lary
Armstrong, son of Dr. Armstrong, andl(
Mr. Wyatt Foster, which uEultetl in the
deatlh of the latter. We have been on- I
able to learn the particular, bat have
been informed that an altereation took
place, and the pistir and knife was
drawn, Mr. Foster being armed with
the latter.

The bill of Mr. 0. D. Tessier, for extra (

Entertain
ment.
Natchitoehes, like other plaeer at this
seaso, of the year mnust needs have its
school exhibition. Last Saturday night,
I the pupils of Mrs. Alice Alinan's private
º school, mostly children aunder twelve
s years of age, gave an exhibition, at the
closeof the session. The evening was
a most delightful one and Firemen's Hall
Iwas densely crowded with the relatives
and friends of the children. The stage
was covered with a carpet and beauti
fully adorned with evergreens wreaths
and elegant vases of flowers.
The Natchituches Brass Band, although
only organized, six weeks ago, assem
t bled in front of the Hall and delighted
- the audience with some really goal
Snmusic.
The exercises consisted in recitations
from every species of poetical composi
tion, songs and dialogues. From the
tiniest scholar in the school to the oldest,
a proficiency was evhibited truly sur
prising, showing that their mental train
ing had been carefully attended to.
There was no hesitancy, stammering or
I stopping. Like well constructed mae
clhanism, there was not a jar or discord
L throughout the exhibition. Frequent
bursts of applause attested the interest
of the audience amnd their approbatlon of
the eftifrts made to please. When every
thing and every one exhilbite4l such ex
r cellence it would be invidious to parti
cularize. The comnpositions particularly,
.how,.d 'more than the average of intel
lectual training in tlhose of such early
years.
The String lBawd composed of citizens
of the place added greatly to the attrac
tions of the evening and the pleasure of
the occasion, by their nmnsic, which, by
the way. they are always ready to fur
nish, upon every occasion of entertain
ments and exhibitions.
Mrs. Alison's school supplies a want
long needed in this community. The
thoroughness of training shown by her
pupils, accounts for her popularity as a
teacher, and the numerous scholars who
attend her day school She is also ably
secbnded by Miss Fannie Johnson, the
youngest daughter of our honored and
highly respected citizen Dr. Johnson.
Taken in all, the exhibition of last
Saturday night was certainly highly
gratifying to the patrons of Mrs. Alison's
school and most assuredly a source of
pride, to the Principal and her estima
ble and accomplished assistant, and will
be remembered in the home circles and
commented on with pleasure, for some
days to come.
We append the programme of the eve
ning's entertainment.

The work is excellent and stands as a
basis for some futnre company to com

this work and his indomltable enterprise
and untiring industry will not sleep, the
public can rest amuared, until this great
