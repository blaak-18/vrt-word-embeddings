VOWING to the constant inquiries from will
if various portions of the United States IIar
Le in regard to the Encalyptus Globulous or
Australian Gum Tree, we are induced to 1101
11 give a thorough description of it, em- to p
t. bracin umany facts not hitherto pub- hand
lished. Through the courtesy of Sonn- ters
- tagg & Co., of this city, we have devoted
uInch time to the cultivation of the tree,
we have obtained most of the informa- privi
tion here furnished. The Eucalyptus is tees
r extensively grown in California, where
probalmly no less than oue milion trees
are planted. In this city, in front of for
i ha1dsonme residences, you. will flid it eral
with its miagnificent droloping branches, enl
making ai n effective and graeeful shade ton
tree. lI Oaklaud the broad avenues are
-lint.i with thenm.
In Algeria its cultilation was under
talkel lo a n arg scale. Sol 1t3,000O ELu
calypti were plhuited in a ll extrelely lpes
tilenital aind utiihealthy lsection,i were fever
cli prevailed tol a great extentll every year m
During the first year of their growth, at
the time when the fever seasoll used to
set in, uot a single ease of fever occurred,
yet the trees were only iiie feet high.
Since then this place is reported free
lfroln its uniwelcolme visitations.
In the viciiity of Constantinople, ali
other fever spot, mlarslhy land sickly, the
whole gromned was driedl upl by 14,b00 of 01o10
these trees. In Cuba mnansh diseases are
rapidly disappearing upon the introduc
tion of this tree. A railway station in
thie Department of Var was so IPestilenltial J.
that the officials could not reimaiiu there ton I
longer thr a year. Forty of tlhese tlrees trle
were planted, uand tile unlheaLlthy colndi
i- tion of the place was changed. Al
lot Two\nlilcs fromu Haywardls, in this -
di- State, the Surveyor Genleral pihited two
la- grovesof the Eucalylptus, one of abolut
it ninety acres anilthe other sevenlty acres,
lic the whole coliprising about 150,00tJ0 trees.
