Parents are sometimes brutal to their
children; and children more often
neglectful of aged parents, but the
State hasn’t a fraction of the difficul
ty in abolishing cruelty in any home
that a multitude of homes experience
in trying to abolish it when practiced
under the authority of the State.
And the thing may well be pondered.

more thousands homeless and desti

Apropos the spread of the cocaine
evil, an article in “Everyday Life”, a
“Dope.”
“Though the young
est and last born of the furies of
‘dope’, cocaine is the most pernicious.
It would be a boon to the world if the
manufacture of cocaine could be done
away with, and the shrub-covered up
lands of Bolivia, whence the bulk of
the coca leaves come (more than
4 0,000,000 pounds annually), could
be blasted into a desert. Medicine
has other substitutes for cocaine, and
can dispense with its services with
little inconvenience, while ‘coke’
(the dope phrase for cocaine) has ab
solutely ruined the lives of thousands,
and is claiming now victims each day.
Fully fifty per cent., if not more, of
the cocaine either manufactured in
tMs country or imported is used to
feed this vice, and not for scientific
purposes. Its cheapness, and the ease
with which it can be taken through
inhalation, without recourse to the
hypodermic needle of morphine or the
‘outfit’ of opium-smoking, have given
it such popularity that the drug
seems to have shifted from the pro
fession of medicine to the mire of
vice. Cocaine’s reputation at present
is more than shady. In every slum
it is the favorite ‘dope’; it leads men
and women, boys and girls, into the
stews, and it keeps them there.
“Cocaine now ranks with whiskey
as the chief provocative of rape and
its consequent lynching bee in the
South. Already among the ‘fiends’
and the policemen who have to deal
with them, there is talk of the ‘new
field’. The phrase, with its commer
cial suggestion, comes from the deal
ers in the drugs, retailers and per
haps wholesalers also. Every ‘fiend’,
it should be added, is more than like
ly to be a peddler of the ‘stuff’, tak
ing his commission in the same mis
ery that he distributes. This ‘new
F is among the brutalized negroes
of the South.”
The commission quotes from
Hampton’s magazine an article by
Judge Harris Dickson, of Vicksburg,
Miss., who told of a contractor who
ordered a pound of cocaine, to the as
tonishment of the salesman to whom
the order was given, who expostu
lated, saying: “No man on earth
can possibly want that much cocaine.”
The contractor reiterated the order.
“A 'man who deliberately puts co
caine into a negro is more dangerous
than he who would inoculate a dog
with hydrophobia,” commented Judge
Dickson. “The deadly drug arouses
every evil passion, gives the negro
superhuman strength and destroys
his sense of fear. Yet the steamboat
negro and the levee negro will not
in Mexico became a
wild torrent, which
desolated the City of
Monterey, destroying
Chicago magazine, has
this to say:
work without it. So the levee con
tractor makes his camp look like a
cross section of hell, but he gets his
dirt moved.”
And any beverage that has “Coco”
tacked onto its name anywhere is a
sure seller.

that is no proof of its freedom from

the well, have the matter looked into
at once, meantime boiling every drop
of water used for cooking and drink

Sprinkle lime freely about the
yard, the stable, and so forth. Espe
cially don’t foster damp, greasy
places back of the kitchen, where
scraps of food or dishwater are
thrown. Such places breed typhoid
fever, and are a constant menace to
health.
If you are so unfortunate as to
have typhoid fever in your home, fol
low minutely the directions of your
doctor, who will outline what is to be
done to protect the rest of the fam
ily. Don’t assume that because a
thing looks clean to you, it is there
fore disinfected, and the doctor is in
sisting upon putting you to unneces
sary trouble. It is much less trouble
and expense to take the pains, and
buy the chemicals required to prevent
contagion, than to have others take
sick, too. Besides the care, expense,
anxiety and loss of wages illness en
tails, typhoid fever is too dangerous
to be trifled with in any way.
THE FIRELESS COOKER A BOON
TO COUNTRY WOMEN.
By an Expert Cook.
Our modern civilization has evolv
ed many labor-saving devices for wo
men, which in comparison to the old
fashioned methods render house
keeping extremely easy. Hence the
country woman has reason to welcome
the fireless cooker and she should not
allow prejudice to keep her from
fully investigating its claims. The
name fireless cooker is somewhat
misleading; heat retainer would have
been better, as the principle upon
which it cooks is that the heat is re
tained by insulation after the food
has been brought to a boil on the
flame or coal stove. This principle
has long been known and used in

Europe and its practical adaptation
to the needs of the American house
keeper is destined to revolutionize the
burden of cooking three meals a day.
By means of the fireless cooker the
farmer’s wife can start her vege
tables, meat and soup to boiling while
she is cooking breakfast and have
snugly packed away in the cooker
half an hour later to be taken out
“piping hot and done to a turn” for
dinner. In the meantime she has a
cool kitchen in which to wash up her
breakfast dishes, churn and do the
many other things that fall to the lot
of a woman in the country.
One farmer’s wife, writing of the
fireless cooker, says: “It is the great
est help to women of the age and the
greatest saver of fuel and labor. My
dinner is all in the cooker now and it
has been for three hours. My kitchen
is nice and cool and I have taken a
good rest. No running to see about
fires, just leave it alone and when
wanted all will be done ‘to a turn’.”
ORDER OF TRUE AMERICANS.
On the 29th day of April, 1909, a
local lodge of the Order of True
Americans was organized at Aragon,
Ga., with the following officers: W.
C. Teel, president; P. S. Damb, sec
retary; Thos. Adams, treasurer; Jo
seph Hicks, doorkeeper. This order
stands for the repeal of the Fifteenth
nendment, the protection of the
Caucasian blood, and a united white
America. The order is preparing to
become a chartered fraternity. For

big toe of a Yankee to ingratiate
themselves in their favor, and I am
afraid that Secretary of War Dickin
son is one of them.
I will not be surprised if in twenty
five years from now (if I live that
long) to hear that we old Confeder
ate soldiers are called traitors.
Every fair-minded Southerner will
admit that we would be better off in
a government of our own, and I en
dorse fully what you say in your Au
gust magazine about the disruption
of these United States. At the un
veiling of the Confederate monu
ment at Statesboro on Memorial Day
the old Johnnies requested me to say
a few words, and in closing I uttered
these sentiments: As I read the fu
ture by the past, and history con
firms it, our republic is doomed.
Take the republics of old, and
as the wealth drifted into the
hands of the few, and these clamor
ing for a stronger government, will
bring a revolution, such as this earth
has never seen, which will divide this
republic into several independent
governments. Yankeedom will not
have the power to coerce all, for they
would not fight, and hiring others to
do their fighting is played out. There
will be independent governments, for
the Pacific Slope will set up one of
her own so she can control her own
affairs, the Middle West is as tired of
Yankeedom as we are, and by giving
them the free navigation of the Mis
sissippi river, will set up a govern
ment of their own, and the other
(God speed the day) of the old Con
federacy, and if there is one spark of
the patriotism, valor and bravery left
in our descendants, as shown by us
during the sixties, the Bonnie Blue
Flag will once more unfold and, I im
agine, the old Johnnies will turn over
in their graves, with the old Stars and
Bars wrapped around their bodies,
come forth with the old rebel yell to
strike one more blow for the star of
the Confederacy to be planted among
the nations of the globe never to fall
again.
Again thanking you for sentiments
expressed in behalf of Dixie, I re
main,
Your staunch friend,
JACOB ROCKER.
Aaron, Ga., August 3, 1909.
Note: Bro. Henry Reed, of The
Cotton Journal, had better remon
strate with our good old friend
Rocker. He’s as “original” as Henry
says I am. —T. E. W.
