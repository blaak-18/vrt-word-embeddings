Popery in China
J. B. Martin thus writes to “The
Protestant Woman”:
“When Robert Morrison landed in
China in the year 1807, Rome was
firmly established, and though suffer
ing great persecution, her numbers
continued to grow. In the present
day her political side so overshadows
the religious that to understand her
position, the political and social side
ought first to be considered. The
principle that ignorant members are
more easily managed than intelligent
ones is seen by Rome’s refusal to give
the Bible to her converts. An in
quirer who bought a New Testament
at the Protestant hall, and was after
wards persuaded by a Roman Catho
lic member to attend his service, was
asked by the priest to grant him the
loan of the book that he might com
pare the passages relating to the Vir
gin Mary to see if the Protestants
had translated them faithfully. After
the book had been kept for three
months, the inquirer asked for its
return. The priest replied that the
passages were translated faithfully,
but he had not compared them at all,
and would keep it a little longer.
That book is still in the possession
of the priest! Another Roman Catho
lic member had a Bible, which was
taken from him. As he still wished
to have one, he bought another, and
kept it at a relative’s house, not dar
ing to let the priest see it in his pos
session. Rome in China has no Bible!
Her complaint against the Protest
ants is that the gospel is made too
cheap. The priests never preach in
the street or sell tracts or gospel por
tions; to visitors they will give a
mass book or treatise on sin or some
other subject. There is sufficient rea
son that Rome should keep the Bible
from the people as in the missal the
ten commandments are mutilated.
The second is omitted altogether,
while the 10th is divided into two
parts. In one district where there
are no nuns, a Chinese woman is em
ployed to teach the women. One
woman was taught the Lord’s Prayer,
but she had not the least idea of the
meaning, as it had been taught in the
highest classical style, which is only
understood by the scholars. The holy
mother and the queen of heaven,
whose images can be seen in many
heathen temples, where they are wor
shipped by the devout, have their
counterpart in the images of the Vir
gin Mary, and the Chinese terms em
ployed by Rome are the very same as
those used for the heathen goddesses.
The similarity between the heathen
temples and the Roman Catholic
chapels is often a matter of comment
amongst the intelligent Chinese.
“But it is Rome in her political
aspect that evokes the hatred of the
Chinese. The massacres in China,
from the Tientsin massacre in 1870
to the massacre of six priests and
nuns and a Protestant missionary
and his wife and children last year in
Nan-chang, have almost all been for
political and not religious reasons,
and in nearly every case Romish in
terferences in the social life of the
people are at the bottom of the trou
ble.
Glje 3effersoniart
“In the year 1899 the Chinese gov
ernment offered official status to the
priests of Rome, thus raising the
priest from the position of the Chi
nese scholar, with whom mission
aries are content to be classed, to the
lank of officials. The offer was glad
lj accepted, but it has borne its own
fruit.
“Concerning this offer the Rev. Ar
nold Foster, of Hankow, wrote at the
time: ‘Rome may get the political
power she covets and with it the de
testation of the people, in whose af
fairs she insists on interfering.’ The
much coveted political power has
been obtained, and the detestation of
the people has been the natural re
sult. Instead of being content to
prosecute a religious propaganda, she
will insist upon interfering in the
law-suits of her members and adher
ents, and as she always sees that her
members gain the day, she thus at
tracts to herself some of the worst
members of society. The officials are
in nearly every case too afraid of the
French power behind Rome to judge
the cases fairly, so they temporise as
the best way out of an awkward diffi
culty. On one occasion a Protestant
missionary was talking with a Romish
convert. On being questioned as to
doctrines, the convert replied, ‘Doc
trines! I know nothing about doc
trines.’ ‘Then what did you join
them for?’ ‘Oh! I joined them for a
lawsuit, and when that was through
I did not go any more.’ It is this in
discriminate reception of members
that brings Rome’s name into such
disrepute. A priest once told a Pro
testant missionary that he did not
consider there was one worthy mem
ber in his district. ‘We do not ex
pect much of them till the third gen
eration!’ Members are received to
swell the roll and not because they
are born again. At a certain Romish
mission house on a recent Christmas
Day, a feast was held according to a
custom obtaining in many stations,
both Roman and Protestant. The
feast was held in the front court
yaid, but in the rear of the premises;
the members gathered in groups,
some singing Chinese comic songs,
while others were gambling! Church
discipline is certainly in existence,
but more for refractory members of
the church than for sinning ones! In
one Romish settlement in China there
is beside the usual chapel and school
buildings a penitentiary and a prison!
On one occasion a man was received
into her communion, and according
to the usual custom the whole family
was enrolled as members, with the
exception of one of the daughters-in
law, who firmly refused to have any
thing to do with this forced conver
sion. She was first coaxed, then
threatened, and as a last resource
was carried off to the Roman Catholic
settlement, where she was put into
the penitentiary. No word of her
was heard for some time, but after
repeated inquiries were made, the
fate of the obstinate girl was discov
ered. She had strangled herself with
the tape with which the women bind
their ankles. On another occasion a

How He Got Rid
of Consumption
Remarkable Rescue of Prominent In
diana Man. A Matter of Life-and-
Death Interest to All Throat
and Lung Sufferers
For Benefit of Jeffersonian Headers, He
Tells How He Cured Himself at
Home—Costs Nothing; to Try.
“I think I owe it to all sufferers of
lung and throat trouble and consump
tion to tell them some mighty good
news, a sure way to cure themselves
right at home with little trouble,” said
E. S. Stroh, of Angola, Ind., yesterday,
as he passed through.
“Coming from me, probably, some
people might doubt this, but let me tell
you,” he said, as his 66-year-old face
flushed with a resurrected, youthful
smile, “over two years ago I was a
weazened-up wreck, a consumptive at
63. Three lung specialists passed me
up. Every day I -would cough up about
a pint. I had chills and fever every
afternoon. I could hardly eat, even the
plainest food, coughed nearly all night,
and was down to 137 pounds when I
hit on the cure. Well, you see me now.
I W'eigh 166 pounds, frisky as a boy at
66, can do a big day’s work, and eat
like a prince.
“Now I am not trying to boost any
body, but I must give credit where
credit is due. Dr. J. Lawrence Hill,
499 Hill Building, Jackson, Mich., the
well known lung specialist of America
and probably so far the only success
ful one, cured me. That was tw r o years
ago. I have just had my lungs ex
amined again and there is no trace of
consumption nor danger of its return
ing. Dr. Hill makes a specialty of
treating throat and lung sufferers at a
distance who have not the means of
visiting his office personally. That’s
the way he cured me, and I know of
many others who had one foot in the
grave almost, brought back to life by
what he calls his Rational Treatment.
It certainly is a wonder.
“I wish every reader of your paper
who has weak lungs, catarrh of the
bronchial tubes or catarrh in any form,
chronic bronchitis, asthma, chronic
hacking cough, loss of flesh, night
sw r eats, hemorrhages, soreness or pain
in the chest or under the shoulder
blades or any other deadly symptom of
consumption, to send to Dr. Hill for his
trial package. This treatment checks
at once further progress of the dis
ease, develops atrophied cell tissues
and brings on new resisting power, ap
petite, flesh and good health.” Fill out
