OtJT OF BOUNDS;
By Margaret Chase.
Nobody’s keeping care of me, I Fan-
ned away alone. K
A farm is not like Parks and Squares,
’N’ if I just hurries up and dares
I can do lots of dang’rous things,
’fore nurse is ever shown
Even the way I got here. 0, I see
the horsey now,
And here’s the barn! I love the noise
That live tiling's make instead of
toys,-
This is the very place to watch the
man that pumps the cow!

OUR CHILDREN.
By Katherine Gordon.
What is the matter with the edu
cation among the common class in
the South today? Perhaps you think
that is a foolish question; at least,
if you believe we have come almost
to a perfect way to educate our boys
and girls from off the farm.
Perhaps you wonder what I mean
when I say, common class? Ym
wonder if I mean the children who
work in the mills daily for their
scanty food and raiment; or if I
mean the sturdy boy and girl on the
farm who do not live in luxury, yet
they have not the faintest idea of
poverty or want for any of the neces
saries of a healthful life.
I answer, I mean all, both the child
who labors, and the child in luxury liv
ing, and the child whose home is the
street and whose bed is where he
finds himself when dark comes down
for they all have something in com
mon between them when they arrive
at an age to be trained to face this
world some time alone, when it will
be theirs to govern, theirs to Chris
tianize, them to blame for it- down
fall, them to receive the reward for
its upbuilding. Then Ihe common
class is the only class.
It may seem foolish to you, but
have you ever given the matter se
rious thought? Have you seen boys’
parents strive early and late to send
their sons to school, finally denying
themselves many comforts and sacri
ficing that John may go to college?
I have, and I have seen that same
boy or girl come back from college to
the old farm knowing something of
algebra, a little Latin, the first prin
ciples of another language, perhaps—
something about arithmetic that was
mostly learned in the common school,
and he has gone through the begin
ner’s geometry, and so on through
the first part of the English language,
etc.
Well, what is he fitted to do in
life’ework?
Certainly, it is a pleasure to him
to know that he has learned some
thing at college, for he undoubtedly
has, but in what way will it profit
him when it comes to the question
of daily labor for bread and meat?
If he wants to go into business he
will have to begin and learn the first
principles of business, and he has no

idea whatever what business men’s
lives consist of. If he wishes to
farm he will have to start at the be
ginning and learn agriculture. If
his chosen profession is that of a
doctor he should have left the common
school or college as soon as he was
able to take the entrance examination
for a medical college, but I think
richer opportunities lie in tlm busi
ness world for the youth who has to
work his way from the bottom of
the ladder.
The agricultural world ..is also call
ing for bright men and women, and
I think if the boys would attend an
agricultural school, if only a short
while, instead of the few years at
college, and go back to the old farm
determined to stick to it, they would
realize more profit from it, and if the
girl who has to depend on her brain
for her living would go to the busi
ness college from the common school,
or go to the millinery school instead
of a few years at college, or would
attend an agricultural school to take
a few’ lessons on chicken-raising or
dairying instead of a year or two
in Latin, physics, algebra, geometry,
etc., she be better fitted for
her life work.
I would not once condemn a college
course, for it certainly has its ad
vantages, but I am speaking in be
half of the people who can’t afford
it, for I believe many a life is wrecked
physically by spending a few years
in an ill-ventilated house, also poorly
warmed building, and often not nour
ishing food, all because the students
can not afford to pay for the ’oppo*
site.
To decide on one’s life work and
aim at that alone, work in that direc
tion only is often the forerunner of
success.
Probably parents do not think se
riously of their child’s mission in the
world, or, perhaps, they think if they
give him an education, such as the
common schools afford, with a few
years at a college in a nearby town,
he ought to be able to do almost any
thing for a living, and it is probable
that the boy can, and will, do some
thing; but in so doing he will have to
start as an apprentice if he means
to learn a trade by which he can
make both ends meet when he leaves
e parental roof.
Then he sees that a little while in a
“school where that trade or business
was taught, instead of the two years
in college, would have put him on
the right path earlier and saved him
many heartaches by having to learn
awkwardly from others what might
ve been taught him so easily.
Another mistake wo are making in
the education of our boys and girls
is not teaching them to prize the
home life, for, after all the glitter
and alluring temptations to lead us
from the fireside, what is there in
life except a home and loved ones to
care for? We often do not find it
out. until the loved ones have been
scattered and the old place gone. In
our strife for worldly things we for
get often to have the nightly romp
with the little ones, the confidential
lofyfc 3effersonian
talk to the elder ones, and after a
while they go in quest of amusements
with no tender memories of the
nightly chat around the old fireplace,
consequently the aged parents sit
alone and wonder why their child
who is away or in his room alone
with other boys is so unappreciative
of the home they strove to build for
•him.
The girl seems to find no pleasure
in confiding to mother her secrets, in
fact, she would tell anybody else, first.
Why? Evidently there is a reason.
When she was a wee girl all her
childish griefs were laid on mother
to bear; mother knew all her plans,
all her hopes. There was a dividing
line drawn between them some time.
When or why was it drawn ?
Was the poor mother too burdened
with keeping the house exactly in or
her that neighbors might not talk of
her slovenly way of housekeeping, to
take the time to help daughter carry
out a certain plan? Probably chil
dren that have no confidence in par
ents know what it is to be nagged, or
many other existing causes may be
the cause wof the separation of the
child-confidence when the daughter
is reaching the most important period
of life and needs a loving mother's
guidance.
The love that should exist between
brother and sister is often missing.
Why? It may be the cause of the
most influential of the two parents
taking the part of the boy and letting
him treat his sister a little badly be
cause by so doing he can accommo
date a friend taking him to ride or
similar pleasure indulged in on after
noons, and his mother letting a son
do so and forbidding the daughter to
complain is making a grave mistake,
whether the act is done through love
for her son or partiality or not feeling
like correcting him, it is a grave mis
take many parents make, as there
should, be no partiality shown in a
family and brother and sister should
be taught to respect the rights of
each other, and a brother should show
respect to his sister as well as respect
and courtesy to other boys’ sisters, or
he will never be quite a true man.
WOMAN-SUFFRAGE.

“I fear I did not understand you
correctly,” said the Man from Mars.
“Did you say that women have no
voice in the affairs of the nation?”
“Exactly,” replied the Politician.
“That would be a cause for rev
olution where I come from,” ob
served the Martian. “How do the
women like to be in that servile po
sition?”
“They like it all right,” answered
the Politician. “Just a few suffrag
ettes object, and they are easily jail
ed; while so far as a revolution is
concerned even the Daughters of the
American Revolution refuse to sup
port the suffragettes.”
“Os course the reason for this un
doubtedly is that the women are of
inferior mental and moral caliber to
the men,” <
“Oh, no!” explained the Politicians
“It is because they are so much’ sup
per i or. ’ ’
“That seems rather illogical. It i**
hard to believe that superior beings
should submit to being ruled by in
ferior beings. ’ ’
“Yes, but don't you see,” obp?c
ed the Politician, “if women got into
politics they would become inferior?”
“Would they?” said the Man from
Mars. “Then, by the same sign, HL,
the men got out of politics, they
would become superior, I suppose?
If-I were a man I wouldn’t-object
to that.”
“Yes, but we love our women ”
“I don’t follow your logic at al',’* /
said the Man from Mars.
“What’s logic?” asked the Politi
cian, with awakening interest. “Is
there any money in it?” — Success

If a child can not breathe with the
mouth shut, heat applied over the
nose will be apt to open the nasal
passages and give relief.
If milk is brought just to the boil
ing point, then immediately poured in
to glass jars with air-tight tops, it
will keep for some time.
Try turpentine and soap to remove
ink stains from linen.
To remove ink stains, wash in a
solution of hydrochloric acid and
rinse in ammonia water. Wet the
spot with warm water, pur on sa
polio, rub gently between the hands,
and generally the spot will disappear.
It is said that flowers will keep
fresh if a small pinch of nitrate of
potash, or common saltpetre, is put
into the water in which they stand.
The ends of the stems should be cut
off a little every day to keep open
the absorbing pores.
To distinguish true, pure linen
from the counterfeit article, wet the
finger and apply to the goods. If
it be pure linen, the moisture will
pass straight through; the spot touch
ed will be soaked at once, and almost
immediately one side will be as wet
as the other.
To remove grease stains, rub with
benzine, lay the article between two
pieces of blotting paper, and iron
with a moderately hot iron.
When your gas stove is not in *
use, especially at night, turn off the
stop-cock between the stove and

Rubber rings which have become ’
hardened may be made pliable and
elastic by soaking them from fifteen
to thirty minutes in two parts of
water and one of ammonia. Some
times there are ridges in the glass
which prevent cans being hermeti

over the place a little putty or a cold
paste of flour- and water.—Woman’s
