FRIDAY, November :3, z896.
We print elsewhere in this issue
a clipping from the Monroe Bul
letin, which shows to what wretch
ed straits Democrats will stoop to
carry their machine nominees
through, even when fighting their
friends, as in this case.
They do not hesitate to enter the
sacred precincts of a man's reli
gion, his home or the grave yard
of his ancestry to make politics
capital.
In this parish two years ago,
Ogden's friends, or his hirelings,
secured votes for him by falsely ac
cuasing Bailey of a prejudice against
Catholics.
And now the same kind of wretch.
ed politics would fain make votes
for the Democratic nominee by de
elaring that Benoit has Catholic
sympathies.
And so be has, but Oh, the mis
erable frauds who would drag a
man's religion into politics !
But thouen there is no telling what
this old fraud-smitten party will
not do.

Last Friday night Hon. B. W.
Bailey, People's party nominee for
Congress, spoke in our city. But
he was unfortunate in having as a
counter-action Al. G. Fields' Min
strels which are very popular in
Shreveport. Hence the attendance
ws small, and some of this naum
ber had to leave to respond to the
alarm of fire, burning a dwelling
not far from the court hose where
the speaking was.
Mr. Bailey was introduced by
Mr. C. D. Hic in a brief talk
sad he was applsuded when he
faced theaudience. H is a foi

Hie was neither aodve nor st

Hope for Silver.
Many people and papers con
tend that McKinlev's election is
due to the sentiment in flavor of
sound money, as the gold standard
is erroneously called, but nothing
r. can be further from the truth.
Not only did his platform de
a clare for international bimetallism,
o but it seems that his followers are
going to force him to a limited
coinage of silver before an inter
- national agreement is reached, and
before the tariff is tinkered with.
It is evident therefore that many
Republicans anticipated this favor
o able action to silver, and voted
for McKinley although favorable
to the white metal.
On the other hand, the Demo
cratic party had a mill-stone about
r its neck in the shape of an admin
e istration which it had elected, that
was more hostile to silver than the
T Republicans had ever been. Not on
I ly so, but this administration used
all the power of its influence and
* prestige of patronage at its com
mand against the party which cre
ated it, and against the Demo
cratic ticket.
These powerful moral and phy
sical forces were the cause of a
o greater loss to the party than the
a Populists and Teller Republicans
r could make up, hence defeat was
inevitable at this election, and the
e wonder is that it was not even
i- greater.
With all these untoward condi
tfons, it was only the matchless
leadership of the brilliant, brainy
young Bryan, together with the
unfaltering support of the Popu
t lists, that saved the Democratic
party from the most ignominious
defeat of its history.
But silver will fare better under
McKinley than it has under Cleve
c land, and in 1900 its friends will
be united and will sweep all oppo
sition to its full restoration on
1equal terms with gold.
t Vote ma C-gresseu.
We give below the vote in the
4th district on Congressmen, which
is correct save in Red River, and
there the proportion is' correct,
if not the footings.
S-The Democrats have evidently
I profited a little even in this dis
trict, by having their friends in
control of the election machinery.
It was so easy to get a sample bal
i lot, and with it vote the entire
population.
At Keachie, in DeSoto parish,
we notice 888 majority for Ogden,
800 of which must hase been col
ored voters, which the new law
was to knock out. At Lamourie,
sad other places in Rapides par
ish, it was quite as bad.
Everything considered, the Pop
list. polled a good vote. Many
oa them were disgusted with the
fusion, and being too honest to
vote against their principles by
voting for McKinley, they staid at
home.
But they should have remember
ed the injustice they did Mr. Bai
leyinataying at home, and also
that no progress was ever made
or victory won by a stay-at-home
policy.
Given a good middle-of-the-road
tic~at and a fair deal, the Popo
lists can win every time in the
th distriot.

FIGHT JUST BEGUN
Mr. Bryan's Words or llope to
llis Followers.
CONTEST WAGED UNDER
CRUSHING DIFFICUL
TIES.
Day of Final Reckoning Merely
Postponed.
Lincoln, Neb., Nov. 6.-Mr.
Bryan to-day gave out the follow
ing:
"To the Bimetalists of the United
States:
"Conscious that millions of loy
al hearts are saddened by the tem
porary defeat, 1 beg to offer a
word of hope and encouragement.
No cause ever had supporters more
brave, earnest and devoted than
those who have espoused the cause
of bimetallism. They have fought
from conviction, and have fought
I with all the zeal which conviction
inspires. Events will prove wheth
er they are right are wrong.
Having done their duty as they
saw it, they have nothing to re
gret. The Republican candidate
has been heralded as the advance
agent of prosperity. If his poli
cies bring real prosperity to the
American people those who oppos
ed him will share in that prosperi
ty. If, on the other hand, his
policies prove an injury to the
people generally, those of his sup
porters who do not belong to the
officeholding class or the privi
leged classes will suffer in com
mon with those who opposed him.
"The friends of bimetallism
have not been vanquished; they
have simply been overcome. They
believe that the gold standard is a
conspiracy of the money changers
against the welfare of the human
race, and until convinced of their
error they will continue the war
fare against it.
"The contest has been waged
this year under great embarass
ments and against great odds.
For the first time during this gen
eration public attention has been
centered upon the money question
as the paramount issue, and this
has been done in spite of all at
tempts upon the part of our op
ponents to prevent it. The Re
publican convention held out the
delusive hope of international bi
metalism, while Republican lead
ers labored secretly for gold mon
ometallism. Gold standard Dem
ocrats have publicly advocated the
election of the Indianapolis ticket
while they labored secretly for the
election of the Republican ticket.
The trusts and corporations have
tried to excite a fear of lawless
nes, while they have been defying
the law, and American financiers
have boasted that they were cus
todians of the national honor,
while they were secretly barter
ing away the nation's financial in
dependence. But in spite of the
efforts of the administration and
its supporters; in spite of the
threats of money loaner,, at home
and abroad; in spite of the coer
cion practiced by corporations and
employers; in spite of trusts and
syndicates; in spite of an enor
mous Republican campaign fond,
and in spite of the influence of a
hostile daily press, bimetallism has
almost triumphed in its first great
fiht. Thba loss of a few Statee,
and that, too, by a very small pin
rality, has defeated bimetallism for
the present, but bimetallism emerg
es from the contest stronger than
is was four months ago.
"I desire to commend the work
of the three national committees
which have joined in the manage
meat of this campaign. Co-ope
ration between the members of
distmct political organizations is
always difioult, but it has been less
so this year than usual. Interest
ina oommon muse of great im
portance has reduced friction to a
minimum. 1 hereby express my
personal gmtitude to the individo
almembersas wellas the execu
tire oficers of the national com
mittee at the Democratic, Popu-I
list and Silver parties for their ef
cient, untiring and unselish la
bors. !They have laid the founds
tion for future succes. and will le
rein"liul ired as pioneers wV.: en vic
• tory is at last s.cnreld.
'No )person:al or )polii:al fri', In
SneleI !zrieve l,-awa11-e Of 1iy d(1 n',,t
My am:lition has been to secre
immediate legislation rather than
to enjoy the honors of office.
Therefore, defeat brings to me no
Y feeling of personal loss. Speak
ing for the wife who hasshared my
labors, as well as for myself. I de
sire to say that we have been am
ply repaid for all that we have
done. In the love of millions of
our fellow-citizens, so kindly ex
pressed; in knowledge gained by
personal contact with the people,
and in broadened sympathies we
find full compensation for what
ever efforts we have put forth.
Our hearts have been touched by
e the devotion of friends and our
lives shall prove our appreciation
of the affection which we prize as
the richest reward which this cam
patgn has brought.
"In the face of an enemy re
joicing in its victory let the roll bt
called for the engagement and urge
all friends of bimetallism to renew
their allegiance to the cause. If
we are right, as I believe we are,
we shall yet triumph. Until con
vinced of his error let each advo
cato of bimetallism continue the
work. Let all silver clubs retain
their organization, hold regular
meetings and circulate literature.
Our opponents have succeeded in
this campaign and must now put
their theories to the test. Instead
of talking mysteriously about
'sound money' and 'an honest dol
lar' they must now elaborate and
defend a financial system. Every
step taken by them should be pub
licly considered by the silver clubs.
Our cause has prospered most
where the money question has been
longest discussed among the peo
ple. During the next four years
it will be studied all over this na
tion even more than it has been
studied in the past.
"The year 1900 is not far away.
Before that year larrives interna
tional bimetalhsm will cease to de
ceive; before that year arrives
those who have called themselves
gold standard Democrats will be
come bimetallists and be with us,
or they will become Republicans,
and thus open enemies; before that
year arrives trusts will have con
vinced still more people that a
trust is a menace to private wel
Ifare and to public safety; before
that year arrives the evilof a gold
standard will be even more evident
than they are now and the people
then be ready to demand an Amer
ican financial policy for the Amer
ican people and will join with us
m the immediate restoration of the
free and unlimited coinage of gold
and silver at the present legal ra
tio of 16 to 1, without waiting for
the aid or consent of any other na
tion. W. J. BRYAN."
