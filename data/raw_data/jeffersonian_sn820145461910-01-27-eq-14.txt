“POOH MAN’S FRIEND.”
Here Are a Few Facts About a Brand
of Cotton That Will Revolution
ize Its Growth.
(From-Atlanta Constitution.)
Perhaps Luther Burbank has never
spent more time in the development of
a plant than has been spent in devel
oping a bhand of cotton known as
“Poor Man’s Friend.” Here are some
of the cardinal points about this cot
t o n:
New and highly improved; 40 per
cent, lint, 70 bolls make a pound; fiber
about 1-16 of an inch longer than mid
dling; 5,560 seeds to the pound; great
est yielder under ordinary conditions
in the South; will make 100 pounds
more lint from 1,500 pounds seed cot
ton than ordinary cotton; only a lim
ited Quantity of seed to be bad at any
price. Will pay sl*o.oo in prizes for
ten stalks grown in 1910. Send for
booklet. J. M. D. Bell, a well-known
man of Spalding county, Ga., writes:
“Made a bale to the acre with common
cultivation on land which never made
more than 1-3 of a bale before.” We
have some strong indorsements. “Poor
Man’s Friend” is early, prolific and
very hardy. ,

Speech of Hon. W. C. Adamson —■
Mr. Speaker: Under pretense of
expediting foreign mails, this bill is
really intended to “rehabilitate” the
American merchant marine. It
should more properly be styled “Bill
to impose additional burdens on our
people to establish and enrich an
other privileged class.” To restore
our merchant marine would be easy
if it were really desired that it
be done properly and honestly. To
“rehabilitate” implies former exist
ence, restoration of which is sought.
It is well known that the splendid
merchant marine which prior to our
Civil War whitened every sea with
its sails, carrying our commerce and
our flag to all countries, returning
as argosies to enrich our people with
the wealth of all nations, was crip
pled, destroyed, driven from the
ocean by protective tariff, that arch
enemy to commerce, the masses of
the people, honesty, and good gov
ernment. If shipping were profitable,
our people would invest money in
the business. It ceased to be profit
able when prohibitory duties pre
vented our ships from hauling for
eign goods into our ports. If they
can not bring home foreign goods,
there can be no foreign demand for
our products, so they could not carry
our products abroad. “We can not
always sell to people from whom we
buy nothing.”
They must exchange some of their
own products for what they buy from
us. Their stock of cash is too limit
ed, they must raise their money, just
as our people do, from their prod
ucts. The greatest evil of protection
aside from its immorality, long ago
admitted by that great republican,
Theodore Roosevelt, is that it de
prives our people of the markets of
the world to sell their products. If a
few prohibitive duties on leading ar
ticles of production in the various
foreign countries were reduced to a
revenue basis, our 90,000,000 pro
ducers could load ships with cargoes
easily and profitably exchanged for
return cargoes, making business
satisfactory and gainful to shippers.
The reason this is not done is the
fear that the profits of a few thou
sand protected favorites who con
trol the transactions of the other
ten millions would either be reduced
or rendered a little more trouble
some and laborious of realization.
Great as was the loss in men and
money, the greatest evil of the Civil
War was the enthronement of greed
and the installation of special privi
lege. While passion and malice
clouded reason and blunted the mor
al sense, a financial oligarchy was
established by law at the expense of
the people by the destruction of fair
and honest banking and financial
svstems. A manufacturing class was
then created and authorized to usurp
the taxing function of the Govern
ment, limit the markets of the peo
ple, and grow rich by exacting tribute
from their fellow citizens, instead
of allowing them to pay fair and
just taxes into the treasury.
It is now proposed to establish an
other privileged class; but instead
of allowing them to thrive by the
restoration of fair and honest condi
tions, their wealth and power must
be promoted by taxation —an addi
tional burden on the common peo
ple without diminishing the privi
leges and profits of the classes al
ready intrenched. There should be
no objection to appropriating all
money necessary to improve mail fa
cilities. foreign and domestic, but in
direction is vicious; sham and hy
pocrisy should have no nlace in legis
lation. The pending bill is undoubt
edly intended as an entering wedge
to the ininuitous ship subsidy, “Tt is
an insidious initiation of a scheme
hereafter to be claimed as fixing a
policy and enlarged into all the enor
mity and rohberv ever honed for by
those who expect to be the benefi
ciaries. If existing prohibitive duties
Cbtye Seffersonum
were reduced to an honest revenue
basis, so as to allow commerce to re
sume its natural and rightful move
ment, general prosperity would
abound and an overflowing treasury
would us to establish and
support all the postal facilities we
need or want to promote intercourse
at home or herald abroad the glad
tidings of prosperity and happiness
among a hundred million people and
our good will for all mankind trad
ing *Vith us in peace and friendship,&
while we exemplify for universal ad
miration the success and beneficence
of constitutional free government on
earth.
March 2,1 909, in House of Repre
sentatives. *
Mr. Fassett, of New York: “This
industry of carrying goods upon the
high seas is the one American Tndus- ,
try that has been slaughtered on the
altar of protection. I have no qualms
in facing it. I agree with the gen
tleman from Mississippi for once,
and I agree with the gentleman from
Missouri for once, that the protec
tive tariff has slaughtered our Ameri
can merchant deep sea marine. (Ap
plause.) We propose now by means
of this bill to change the situation,
to bring it under the aegis of protec
tion and get down to a square deal
and fair play.”
In U. S. Senate, July 5, 1909.
Mr. Bacon: “It is very hard to
draw comparisons of that kind, be
cause there are no conceivable cir
cumstances under which the tariff
can affect, either beneficially or oth
erwise, the cotton crop except in the
burden imposed upon those who pro
duce it.”
HE MAKES THREE BALES GROW
WHERE ONLY ONE GREW
BEFORE.
John B. Broadwell, of Alpharetta,
Ga., the originator of the now famous
Double-Jointed Cotton on which two
limbs come out together from the main
stalk and two bolls side by side on the
limb, has proven that it is an extraor
dinary variety of this familiar plant
which has been evolved by a process
of scientific experiment and cultivation
on his own farm.
Its discoverer, who by means of long
observation and tedious scientific ex
periments in the production of the best
kinds of cotton, has won a just repu
tation as a pioneer cotton developer of
the South.
Mr. Broadwell had for some years
been making observations on the best
k’nd of seed to plant and methods of
cultivation in order to secure the best
results in cotton production, when,
partly by accident, he hit upon the
nlant which formed the basis of the
now remarkable double-jointed varie
tv. In the fall of 1902 Mr. Broadwell
found in his cotton-field a peculiar
looking kind of cotton. The limbs
seemed to come out from the main
stalk and on the two limbs two bolls
grew side by side. A count of the
bolls on the stalk convinced him that
this was the best cotton in the whole
field, the field having been planted with
a mixed variety. Every boll of these
singular stalks was picked, the seeds
preserved and the next spring they
were planted. The harvest from the
seeds that first year of the experiment
was so small that no definite results
could be reached, but Mr. Broadwell
continued the work, preserving the
seeds of this new kind of crop each
year until in the spring of 1905 he was
able to nlant four acres in them.
The yield was highly satisfactory,
and with renewed study and attention
to the development of this kind of cot
ton, it has reached a degree of perfec
tion hardly hoped for and has yielded
as much as 700 bolls on a single nlant.
Broadwell’s Double-Jointed Cotton
has received the highest tribute ever
naid to any variety of cotton. It has
taken the first and second prizes for
the largest yield of cotton in the Geor-

R. D. TATUM, Fairview Farm, Palmetto, Ga.
gia State Fair for the past five years,
and it has also taken both first and
second prizes for the best ten stalks of
cotton for the past five years.
The advantage of this variety of cot
ton over others is that it yields more
to the acre than other varieties, three
bales to the acre being the average
which Mr. .Broadwell has reached in
cultivating it after seven years of ex
periment and labor devoted to securing
the largest possible yield from his
crop.
Mr. Broadwell has reached some re
sults which ought to be interesting to
cotton-planters from experiments in
the best variety of cottonseeds to
plant. After much investigation he
has concluded that in the selection of
cottonseed nothing i§ more important
for the planter to know than the dif
ferences in seed in various parts of the
lock and boll, and he has written an
interesting book that will be of great
value to every cotton-grower in the
South. This book will be sent free to
every farmer asking for it. See Mr.
Broadwell’s announcement on page 20
of this issue.
FORGOT THE BOOK.
A lady who ordered some caracul
coats to be sent up on “appro,” on
Saturday returned them on the Mon
day following with the message,
“None were suitable.” The next
morning she received a courteous
communication from the head of the
department returning her prayer
book, which had been found in the
pocket of one of the coats. —Liver-
