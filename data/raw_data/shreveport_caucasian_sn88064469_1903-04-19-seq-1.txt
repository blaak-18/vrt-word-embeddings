THE GRAND, JURY
\ ,'ILL CONVENE MONDAY NOOŽ
IN SPECIAL SESSION.
A Vigorous Iriuiry Will Be Prosecute(
into the Mysterious Murder of
Mfrs. A. L. Matthews.
The grand jury will convene in the
court house at 12 o'clock tomorrow, it
special session, to inquire into the mur
der of Mrs. Alice Matthews. The con
vcning of this body by Judge Land is or
the recommendation of the jury of in.
quest. What may be developed by this
grand jury can not be anticipated. The
crimp which they must investigate is
shrouded in the deepest gloom of mys;
tery, and yet a clue infinitesimal may
lead to an important conclusion. With
surmises and with theories which are
many and little substance, if any, in fact,
the grand jury and the district attothey
will he put tM a test as has never been
experienced by such authority in Cadda
1pariJh. But if, after a thorough exami
its mystet, there 'will be -some comfort
in the reflection that the case' was not
permitted to lapse for inattention, and it
is probable that this grand jury may
probe into the murder. sufficiently, if not
successfully, to strengthen the all-pow
erful arm of the law to reach beyond and
perhaps in time secure-the murderer. As
regards examinations of this character
and to court proceedings in general it is
true that the greatest number of people
have an aversion to any connection with
any affair 'or matter which would lead
them into court as witnesqs, but this is
an extraordinary case when no informa
tion should be withheld from the grand
jury and the district attorney. This is rio
.time for hesitation or shirking ai duty,
disagreeable as it may be, and in such
an emergency it is the duty of ;,every
good citizen,- man or woman, regardless
of color or condition, to impart to the
legal authorities, whatever may be known
of this horrible crime.

RIDICULOUS REPORTS.
W) IY ACCEPT AS TRUE THE UN
REASONABLE
And Improbable Sensations and Exag.
gerations Which Should Be Dis
credited by Sensible People.
The readers of the Caucasian whc
know its editor have long since realized
that his views on the racial question are
positive and that he is uncompromisingly
in favor of the rule of intelligence and
white supremacy, but he would always
deal honestly and fairly with the inferior
race. In the enjoyment of his life, his
liberty and property, the negro is entitled
to the fullest protection of the law, to
which he is held amenable when a trans
gressor; and there are well defined lim
its to which he is circumscribed, socially
anad otherwise, which he would not
transcend except at his peril, in his loss
of property, of liberty and of life. All
these limits are well understood by him,
and we add that he is not revengeful and
bears no malice, and in this respect he is
unlike men of other races who nurse
their resentment until they have satiated
their hatred in the blood of their vic
tims, whom they will pursue to the brink
I of the grave.
These remarks are suggested by the
reports and exaggerations which have
.operated to the excitement of fear and
apprehension in many families in this
city. Indeed, it may be said that on the
insidious propagation of these wilful and
senseless exaggerations that some people
have become so alarmed in their fancy
of a direful impending calamity that
they have secured means of defense, and
we know families who have all but bar
ricaded their doors during the absence
at night of the male members of the
household;
Why will rational, intelligent people
accept as a fact the improbable and the
unreasonable? As an instance of these
villainous exaggerations it may be said
that a gentleman, otherwise sensible,
called on the Caucasian editor with a
story that was in 'substance that a band
of negroes had on a night of the past
week rcogregated in th. wad near the
Junction and were burnlshing their old
guns and pistols and sharpening their
knives for a complete butchery-of all the
women and children. This man in telling
his hair-raising story was in earnest, but
as other men, he was going about on an
impulse as unreasonable as it was pre
posterous, and when he, was made to
realize how ridiculdus was his predica
ment he was profuse in his regretful
expression. But he, and others as sense
less, had left on other unthinking minds
the impress which aroused fear and ap
prehension in many homes. Again we
query: Why, will the improbable and
unreasonable be accepted unquestioned
by sensible people?
Seriously, if the negro was disposed
to retaliation -by slaughter and the torch
how long could he maintain himself in
this diabolical work ? He would soon be
vwerpowered and crushed as one would
break an egg shell in the hollow of his
had,, and the old and ,the young, the
guilty and the innocent would be eater
minated, wiped off the surface of .the
earth..
But, as we have said, the negro appre
ciates his position, and it is fair to say
that he would not countenance any act
which would lead. to his disaster and
ruin. InA a moment of excitement such
thas arrestpd and engaged the attention
of this community over the perpetration
of a horrible crime, the negro has not
been moved by resentment or a revenge
ful spirit, but by fear and apprehension-
the fear and apprehension which he has
realised from his condition, from his race
and his color, which, in an outbreak,
precipitated.by some-irresponsible negro
or white man, would lead to a bloody
horror in which the negro innocent and
helpless as well, would be the victim.
Talk noL tornme ~ or mention to me the
word "Eor " The horrors of two riots
enacted years ago at the Mechanics In
stitute and later on Canal street, in New
Orleans, when the military were called to
the scene, is still vividly impressed on
the mind.
Realizing this condition, then depend
ing in a great measure on the protection
of the white man, from whom he must
earn the means for his livelihood, why
should the negro then assume te k.un
reasonable and suicidal cot#se which
would lead to his extermination."
We have taken this view gad give
these expressions in a spiritof fairness
and justice to the negro and to demon
strate the absurdity of the senseless ex
aggerations which have led families in
this city to a hlensiot and fear. In
uch a hogeent txIcoai 5 the plain tlnty
Sr the to be i 1sf snd
lOiy
cf the people. Our only regret is that we
Sc ld not reach the public, on this ques
tion. hefore this issue .f the Caucasian,
and we trust our vicv, s will have the
happy effect of restoring conidence and
the fullest safety in the breast of every
good law-abiding citizen, regardless of
his race or creed. It is not always the
mission of the newspaper to publish ex
aggerated and blood-curdling sensations,
as there is a time for high duty and wise
counsel.
As an indication of the absurdity of
the reports to which ~\e have referred,
we reproduce the comments of the two
newspapers publlishec by negroes in
Shreveport in the interests of the negro.
The News-Enterprise, A. H. Samuels
proprietor, says:
"A rumor is being circulated that the
negroes are holding meetings and organ
izing for the purpose of 'retaliating' for
the burning of a dead negro.
"It is even too absurd to deny, but as
some people will believe anything about
the negro. we desire to inform them that
it is not so.
"The negroes were horrified at the
dastardly and atrocious murder of Mrs.
Matthews and attemp to o take the life of
the little girl, and when it was an
nounced that the culprit had been killed
while attempting to escape the negroes
approved the act.
"Since it is admitted that Ed Wash
ington was innocent of the crime, the
negroes, in common with all fair minded
citizens, believe a mistake has been made
and are anxious to see the murderer
captured, be he white or colored, and
dealt with according to law.
"Pray tell us why should the negroes
retaliate? If irresponsible parties have
justified by their language such rumors,
they do not represent the sentiment of
the race, the majo;ity of whom are for
law and order."
The Shrevepert Watchman, S. H.
Ralph editor and business manager,
says:
"We appeal to our people to keep cool.
Nothing can be done about these sad
occurrences. The more you say, the
worse you make it. There is no use to
sdd fury to folly.
"Improve all of your opportunities,
stand by yourselves and your race and
never blame the good white people for
what the bad' ones dlo. If you are true to
yourselves and to your best interests God
will right your wrongs for you or give
you a powerful arm to right them for
rourselves.
"In the meantime go to work, save
rour money, educate your children and
each them to be industrious and law
tbiding.
"We have too many no account young
negroes in the town dives, gambling
dens and out of proftable employment.
Such jail trash will notonly bring re
proach upon all the other good negroes,
but would murder Jesus Christ if they
had a chance. Let us honestly endeavor
to lessen their numbers by aiding the
authorities to detect and punish them.
We have the best white people with us,
and when we have done our duty no
harm can come from appealing to the
authorities to give us better protection.
Be as good as you can; keep as cool as
you can, and never act a fool until God
dies.-S. H. R."
This is good wholesome counsel which
every sensible, self-respecting negro
should take to heart.
