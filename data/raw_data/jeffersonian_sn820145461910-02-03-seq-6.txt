SOME QUESTIONS.
Dear Sir: —Will you kiudly an
swer the following questions through
the columns of the weekly Jeffer
sonian :
(1) Who graduated with first hon
ors at West Point in R. E. Lee’s
class?
(2) Where does a municipality get
the right to levy a street-tax on a
person under twenty-one years of
- age? A SUBSCRIBER.
Dublin, Georgia.
Answer.
(1) A New Yorker, named Charles
Mason, took the First Honor in Gen
eral Lee’s class, Lee taking Second.
This was in 1829.
When the inquiry came to me, it
was necessary for me to seek the
information. The Georgia poet,
Charles W. Hubner, was the first to
give me the facts. Almost immedi
ately afterwards, Major Jos. B. Cum
ming wrote me to the same effect, he
having received the desired informa
tion from his brother, General Al
fred Cumming.
Major Cumming was good enough
to enclose with his reply to me the
note of General Cumming. In read
ing this, I see that the General states
that Charles ?»lason died long ago.
(2) Municipalities don’t have to
get any “right” to do anything.
They just go right ahead and do it —-
“rights” are not in it, at all.
Recorders’ Courts and Town
Councils are not supposed to be tram
melled by any legal limitations what
soever. Andrew Jackson’s overcoat
wouldn’t be big enough to make a
vest for the average Recorder. As
to Town Councils—they are Little
White Czars, unhampered by Duma
or Bureau.
They not only do just what they
please, but they do it just as they
please.
Don’t come asking me where a mu
nicipality gets the “right” to do
this, that, or the other. I’m too
busy a man to be interrupted by fu
tile and exasperating questions of
that kind. T. E. W.
“NAPOLEON.”
My Dear Sir: —Within the year I
have expended more than two thou
sand dollars for biography and his
tory relating to Napoleon. Among
my purchases is your “Napoleon”,
which I have just read. I finished it
in tears, and before my eyes are dry
I want to thank you for the great
‘service you have rendered the world
in writing it. I, with thousands of
others, will always be your debtor
because of it.
With grateful acknowledgment, I
am, Sincerely yours,
J. FRANK HORSLY.
Indianapolis, Indiana.

sonian of this date that some of your

ruary, 1908, number. The 1908

Yours very truly,
T. J. STEED.
Buena Vista, Ga., Rt. 6.
TAFT AND THE FRIARS.
Dear Sir: —In The Jeffersonian of
December 9th, in the article, “Mr.
Taft and Papa’s Hierarchy”, you
speak of Taft giving the friars
$7,000,000 for their dishonestly ac
quired land. Now let me quote
from Taft’s letter to Rev. Magnus
Larson, pastor of the Swedish Bap
tist church, St. Paul, Minn. In the
letter to him he says the $7,000,000
was paid from bonds issued by
the Philippine Government and ap
proved by the Filipinos. I suppose,
according to that, the Filipinos had
rather pay the Pope $7,000,000 than
give the beastly friars the husband’s
duty on the wedding night. He
speaks of how he assisted Rome, and
we suppose the Pope agreed that the
friars would not longer exact the
rights of Ponda. And it looks as if
that is about all the poor Filipinos
got for their $7,000,000, for he says
the present Governor is Roman
Catholic.
The poor natives had to be bond
ed, to keep their homes, and Taft
does not claim in his letter to Lar
son, they took the $7,000,000 and
got out of the island. No one claims
they are dispossessed of church
property. Still the $7,000,000 raised
against the poor Filippinos, it is
without any doubt the rottenest and
dirtiest deal that was ever pulled off
in our country.
Now let us turn to Mr. Bryan, who
had been to the island in his trip
around the world, and knew all the
circumstances in regard to the deal,
and when the company got hot and
the mighty hunter was 'afraid Bryan
would spring the Philippine deal, he
called him down, and Bryan rared
at the mighty hunter, and let Taft go
with his deal with the Pope. I think
Bryan the worst political coward in
the land. With his command of lan
guage, and magnetic force, he could
have downed Taft sure. He maybe
thought his personality was worth as
much as Taft’s $7,000,000. He had
interviews with the Pope when he
came around the world. Now, what
are we to do? The great journals
and all news associations are censor
ed by the Hierarchy. In this Philip
pine deal everything was kept down,
and Taft was given great credit for
how he had straightened out the
natives. All the leading papers here
in old Missouri are controlled by the
same power. I can not get anything
published—that is, the least word
against the Catholics. They domi
nate the entire press, even the Com
moner will not publish anything
detrimental to the old Roman
Church. The only way to break
through this mountain of power is
to call a new party convention, which
could be done. It can not be done
the way you are trying. You can not
get good support, and the other pa
pers will not print a word from your
pen. I am a reformer as well as
yourself, and all that think as we
do must get in shape to pull to
gether, and the only way is to call a
convention, and in the call exclude
all office-holders in State and nation,
and all land managers, and all old
political hacks, get together a class
of producers, and then start a few
good men out in the lecture field,
and they must whale it to the old
press until all of the small journals
come into line, and then they will
have to show their hand.
Inclosed please find an article
which will give you a tip what to do.
If we work on that line, I think we
131) £ Jeffersonian
can get the Protestant Church to no
tice the movement. You will see
how I have condensed in the article
the idea; it is the only way to break
through—there is too much power—
the Law, the Press, and the Catholic
Church.
I give you what I think. If you
see anything in it, I will be happy to
do what I can.
Yours truly,
A. D. RICHMOND.
Jonesburg, Mo.
(I am in possession of the evidence
concerning the Catholics and the
Filipinos. We’ll lay it before our
readers. T. E. W.)
ECHO OF R. F. D. CONVENTION.
Dear Sir: —Your letter at hand,
and I note what you say as to resolu
tion passed at the last Convention of
Rural Letter Carriers in Rochester,
N. Y.
In answer, I was sick in my bed
on the day that this resolution was
passed, and I knew nothing of it un
til I read it in the October R. F. D.
News; my assistant must have over
looked it, or he gave it to the official
stenographer. I have written to the
official stenographer to forward to
me at once the resolution in question,
and as soon as I receive it I will mail
it to you. lam very sorry that you
didn’t receive it before.
Assuring you of my sincere re
gards, and believing you to be the
pioneer in advocating rural delivery,
I am,
Very truly yours,
P. E. CULL, Sec’y.

FOREIGN MISSIONS.
Dear Tom: —It seems to me that
the settlement of this Foreign Mis
sions question is the simplest and
easiest proposition I ever met.
If you have told the truth about
Foreign Missions, that should and
does settle it; with every one except
a fool or a fanatic; for no one else
will be found eternally condemning,
vilifying, abusing and nagging at a
man for telling the truth. It does
TO ALL SUBSCRIBERS:
PREMIUM KNIVES: The demand for the Watson knife has been
so extraordinary that the .factory where they are made was unable to
keep up with our orders. The manufacturers assure us that they are
using every effort to push the work, and that they will fill all our or
ders in course of time. We must ask our subscribers to be patient, and
to advise us if the knives are not received in about two or three weeks
from date of order, so that we may trace them up.
WATSON’S MAGAZINE: JANUARY NUMBER: Although we
printed an unusually large edition for January, it was exhausted dur
ing the first week. All orders for the January issue which have come
in since the 10th have been filed in our office, and will be filled, if pos
sible, when we get some returns from the news-stands. It is improba
ble, however, that we shall be able to meet the tremendous demand for
this copy, and the subscriptions will begin with our enlarged and im
proved February issue. If you want the February number, send in your
order at once. The supply won’t last long.
BACK NUMBERS: Except in rare instances, we can not supply
back numbers of Watson’s Magazine, or of The Jeffersonian. The Mag
azine is always in the mail by the 25th of the previous month, and the
Weekly is invariably out on time. If you miss a single copy, you will
do us a kindness by letting us.know at once. If you do not advise us
promptly, it may be impossible for us to supply the missing number.
Whenever you find any mistake or delay, tell us about it. We will ap
preciate the “kick”. JAS. LANIER,

not argue well for the morals of a
country in which so much of that is
done. If you have lied in your state
ment of facts, or criticisms, let your
accusers produce the proof, and that
will settle it for all time. Mere as
sertions will not; the proof must
come. So far as I have noticed, none
of our Bishops and ablest preachers
have made any vicious attacks on
you. I presume that no one who
knows Dr. Broughton is at all sur
prised at his course. The Doctor is
so constituted he just can not help it.
I think I would prefer to be swal
lowed by a big fish, than nibbled to
death by minnows. It runs in my
mind that the biggest trouble, after
all, lies in the fear that when the
people become posted somebody will
lose a little revenue. May you live
long to post the people, and prosper
in your work. May you never grow
weary, and the people never cease to
love and esteem you as their best
friend.
Most respectfully and affection
ately,
JAMES J. GREEN.

ALL PAPERS SHOULD DEVOTE
SOME SPACE TO INDEPEND
ENT VIEWS.
Editor Jeffersonian: — Please al
low me space, on your “letters from
people” page, to record a prophetic
warning to those editors who arbi
trarily refuse to publish views of
people with whom they do not
agree. At present I am thinking of
your failure to get a hearing in the
religious papers on the subject of
Missions. Since a prophet is re
garded as a dubious character, par
don me for first referring to several
of my past prognostications.
A few weeks before the Presi
dential election of 1904, I wrote an
article, published in the Augusta
Tribune, declaring that the tariff
was the source of our political ills.
Before the similar election last
year I wrote another and fuller ar-
