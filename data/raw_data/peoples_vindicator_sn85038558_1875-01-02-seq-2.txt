Does the editor of that paper presume
to say that he doubts the fact of a
conservative victory ? We deinaed
he explain what -- means, and in
order to set himsef right, to do so at
once.
We trust that all the members of
the Legislature eletald by the people
will be promptly on hand In New Or
leans for the opening of the 1875 see
sion of the General Assembly. From
this parish he members elect have
gone, and we sauiously await good
words frem them.
The commaders of White League
sections of this parish are requested
to meet at the Firemen's Hall on Wed
nesday nett, January 6th, 1875.
We wish our readers a HAPPY Iw

even this with a full heart. A people
whose liberty is trembling in the bal
lance are in no mood to bandy erm
plements. The year 1875 opens dark
and gloomy, and we can bat hope
that some happiess is in store for us.
Rain, mad and slush makes out

Let us hlve a Convention of the
'North Lou ms parishes, say at
Shreveport at an early day. What
says the North aLo~iana press ?
It will bi smen fa. our news col

Gov. Warmouth had a difaiulty on
Canal street in td Oity, in wiich the

the lights before us, ,we must asy
that Gov. Warmoth was eatirely Jj

Are we Ready ?
Louisiana expects every man to do
his duty in this her dark and trying
hour, and we would be recreant to
the trust imposed In us by our fore.
fathers, false to our name and race,
and traitors to our wives and chil
dren, should we not accord to our be
loved State a full measure of as
sistance.
The horde of vandals have inva
ded the sacred sanctuary of the in
ner temple of our liberty, and duty
demands they should be expelled;
that they should no longer be allow
ed to pointe that sacred edifice with
foul contaminating touch. 'Villainy
and crime are in league against hon
esty and virtue, and all our nobler
instincts cry out to resist their inva
sion. To us the courts are closed,
the ermine of the judiciary is drag
ed is the filth of political thievery;
the ballot box is no longer tenable,
its purity has been destroyed and the
voice of the people, expressed at the
polls, Is hushed by the rude hand of a
partisan Returning Board.
We have appealed to the people of
the Union and they, on the 3d of No
vember last, answered our cry ii
thunder tones, from Main to Califor
nia-from the Lakes to the Gulf. Still
we are not free-a partisan brutal
President stands between the express
ed will of our brethren of the North
and ourselves, and with his mailed
hand proceeds to fasten upon us those
chains our countrymen have torn
asunder. Appeals, petitions, remon
strances, are to him alike unheeded,
they fall but on the cold dull ear of
a drunken apostate, who turns the
crank of oppression at each fresh cry
of our agony. With courts and bal
lot boxes denied is; the expressed
will of our fellow-country-men nu
tralized and thwarted by U. S. Grant,
what in God's• name is left for us to
do? We must resist ! for if we yield
forther, we are gone' beyond hope*
Upon the action of the citizens of
Louisiana depend the solution of the
problem of free government in AAmer
ica, for should the President be al.
lowed to set this precedent of over
throwing the xpressed'will of a peo
ple by force alone, then farewell lib
erty. The coming month is pregnant
with mighty events, events upon
which hang momentous issues. The
waters of public feeling are lashed
to fury and we can discern no dove
returning to the ark of liberty with
its olive branch, of peace-the future
looks dark and gloomy and clouds
of war overspread our political hod
san; in this hour, the hour that try
mens souls and bring up to the sor
face all that is good, pure and noble
In mans nature; we, the people of
Louisiana, must be as one man in our
condemnation of the partisan and
villainous acts of the usurper and his
backers; must be prompt and undy
ing in our reeistance to further en
croachments upon our rigths-must
be quick and stern in demandisg and
esforeing an accordance to us of those
liberties to which, we as a free people
are entitled.
Inthis we mustbe cool, calm and
deliberate; move .on, this is no time
to falter, let the weak and timid get
them to places of security, for in the
storm that i Sbout to buretupon us
none but the sons or NUx with the
blood of heroes in their veins are
wanted.
Fellow-coautry-men of the lad of
the Myrtle sad the Orange, Iu liber

ABl YOU PRGPARID.
The statement made by the retura
ing board on the completion of their
labors is a document In strict keeping
with their acts. It has never been
oar fortune to pernu a more vilaian
oua tissue of falsehoods.
All aidadvits bearing against ouar
people were susidued but noth ig
we could may or swear too was enter
tamined. It is useless to comment
upon the a~br. Meassers. Jack and
Cuninngham, Distriet Judge sid Dis
triet Attorney elect by the people
were so so returned ina the promal
pgation, notwithatanding the solemn
assurance of Wells tohe oetrary.
Dubuelet is returned elted by
98 majorifty; with a Radies allower
House thus the game goes on, and
poor Louislaus must be robbed and
her people insulted because, forsooth,
Grant sad. hi army says so.
• Pedple of Loamisan, bow much

The FLTraT is always welcomed by
our people, and we are sure the
public will not overlook the exertions
her fine commander John Mitchel huas
made during all stages of water to
supply the trade with a boat. That
genial gentlemana, James Robbins, has
charge of the ofice with Rowlad as
second clerk, We know tbit our
friends will do all in their power to
snpport the Fletat
Slaves or Freemen ?
When the fate of a people depend
upon what outside parties decide as a
proper course for the oppressed to
persue, we can have but little hope
for that people. Such is the uufor.
tunate condition of poor Louisiana
in the opinion of our leading men.
The old fable of the "Lark and the
Farmer" over again. We will not
depend upon our own exertions for
succor, but beat about for others to
protect and defend our liberties; ap
peal and apply to those .who do not
understand our situation, and who
have never been in political antage.
nism'with such a party as the pro.
perty owners are contending against
in some of the Southern States.
Success will only come to us when
we exert our owrn power .to secure it;
sympathy is all well and good as far
as it goes, but we must have some.
thing more substantial, and that im
mediately, or we are both politically
and physieially dead.
If we of Louisiana intend to do
anything to secure our threatened
rights, now is the time to do it. Pro
test and appeal have failed to afford
us relief, and if the "hold on awhile"
advocates have any plan whereby
they can save us, let as have it, else
let THE PEOPLE take the matter in
hand, and we will insure that their
efforts will be crowned with success.
The hour for debate is passed, and
action is what the moment demands.
Words are wasted to the idle wind
deeds will only make as free. Leave
aside, we beseech you, Louisianians,
all hope of material aid from any
power save yourselves, yeu will as
in the past, receive an ocean of sym
pathy, when to us a rivulet of assist
sace would amount to more. If we
fail now, then all hope is passed, and
our fair felds must be abandoned to
the negro and his ally, or we must
live as the abject slave of the Carpet
bagger and Scalawag. Let as choose
and that quickly, under which king
we serve.
Myers and Pierson.
Myers has been at his old tricks
again, as we see he had a band in the
St. Tammany fraud. He is well cal.
calated to do such duty work, for as
a villain, thief and liar, he, in a small
way, stands nanlvalled. Eddy Pier.
son according to the Republicas, puts
in a word in relation to the persons
who claiming to be residents of ward
5 and 6 of this pariah, and signed affida
vits of intimidation; he pays two of
these men are known to him, and the
other four may reside here for aught
he knows, as there are a thousand
men in the parish he does not know.
Piersn lies mot egregiously, and he
knows it well, for he has been in this
pariah all his life, and has held posi
tions well qualif8ed to give him an
acquaintance with every one. The
people here have a great advantage
of him in acquaintance, for they all
Ihow hism-to be one of the grandest
villains of the Natchitoches pack,.for
even after what he had done to break
down his people in ridding themselves
of Myers, Boullt, Bluntand that class;
he had iomae sympathisers, sad .hi
acknowledged to them he was beaten
and wouald go to New Orleans, if they
would let him, and do everything in
his power to seat the People's mes
biers of the Legislature and to get
commissions for all the oflcers they
had elete. 'He nso sooner gets with
his b em friend'Mydr, and his boon
companions, Breda, Blunt, Raby and
other thieves sad negros #omr Nateh.
iteohee sad elsewhere,' when he for
gets all his blubberlog promises and
ererts all iih ibfltence to defeat the
will of tlo~e who had in the past
been of his friends and race.

sCan say one antfom us what nmm
ber of votes.will be. required' ina the
next election to earry Louioians fot
the-whites When 1..000 and 5.600
won't do, how many will ?
Tis EsD.--fe have reached in
the order of events; the end of the
swindling acts of the Radical Return
ing Board, and we stand in amaze
ment in contemplation of the villain
ous acid unlawful manner with which
we have been treated by this saint
ed (t) crew. To suppose that the end
of the entire matter has been reached
is but to add insult to the outrages al
ready heaped upon us.
Let us now, fellow citizens, calmly
view the surroundings and take such
action in the premises as is required.
For our part, we have no more warn
ings to give to our enemies, as they
seem to have paid but little heed to
what has been told them for the past
six months, but have, on theeontrary,
spurned our petitions, laughed at our
remonstrances, and insultingly kick
ed us from their presence.
Self respect can stand no more, and
patriotism demands that, if we meant
anything in our utterances, we should
act speedily.
The villainy of the Returning Board
is at an end, the virtue of our people
must begin to assert itself.
- - ---.mo.- -- -
We do not propose that our peo
ple should in any way misunderstand
us, for we use "blunt English" to ex
press our ideas, and write what we
think in a manner not to be suscepti
ble of two meanings, therefore the ar
ticle in last weeks issue, upon the
"Fruits of Victory" is.not intended
to place our worthy candidates for
District Judge and Attorney, in a pe
sition as being themselves parties to
a compromise, for we know too well
their patriotism, to doubt for a mo
ment the stand they will take in this
crisis. Although legally elected, they
will take their chances with their
people, and await the issue. If we
loose the General Assembly, which is
ours by right of a majority of votes,
by the frauds of a Returbing Board,
our Judge and District Attorney will
not accept positions at the hands of
the insutament that deprives as of
the only means of redress, the Leg
islature, knowing that they would be
powerless to succor their people ftro
evil.
The Tbadicator will be issued on
half sheet until farther notice. We
give, notwithstanding, our usual
quantity of reading matter. Our
friends will readily understand why
this is done. This paper has been
published at a steady loss since its
first issue, and we desire to make
Miat los as small as possible.
When the printing outrage is re
moved by just legislation we will en
large our paper, until then we will
give the enemy all the fire 'e can
with a half-sheet.
We call attention to the card of
Chaplin & Chaplia, Attorneys atLawI,
in to-days ianse. This is a well known
and reliable legal firm, and parties
litigant will hb assured of having
their business attended to with eare
sad attentiobn.
That gem, the City Billiard Saloon,
csils the attention of our gentlemen
to the many advantages in its line,
in to-days issue. KaIle, the well
kown catorer, usisted by the hand
some oand genial Asher, the prince of
Barkeepers, will always be found
ready todispense the hoepltahlities of
the house. Oyrters, ash and game
