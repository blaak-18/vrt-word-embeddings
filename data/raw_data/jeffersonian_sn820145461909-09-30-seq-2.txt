HE State Board of Education,
of Massachusetts, will begin
the establishment of trade
schools, the first of the se-
II
ries to be a girls’ trade school
in Boston to teach dressmaking,
millinery, clothing machine and
straw machine operating, as well as
simple grammar school studies. These
schools are to be open to all pupils
over fourteen years of age, whether
they have had any elementary school
ing or not.
Schools of this nature would be a
God-send to any section, and it is to
be hoped they will multiply. Par
ticularly do girls need to be saved
from being fed to the great facto
ries, (where they learn nothing but
to do one monotonous detail of the
vast work, and always retrograde,
never progress;) and to be put in the
way of completely mastering an
independent, interesting occupation
If they never need to make their own
living by it, it can not come amiss for
any woman to realize, in her own
development, the value of skilled la
bor. She is bettered infinitely by
knowing how to do some one thing
well, instead of, as in so many thou
sands of cases, merely knowing how
to do a number of things in a slov
enly fashion. Besides which, the
skilled worker in any vocation, usu
ally has the time and inclination for
self-culture; the untrained worker
never has the time, and the disposi
tion to advance is soon lost in the
treadmill.

A letter has just reached me, the
gist of which is a woman’s urgent
need to earn money and still remain
at home. The amount required is
pathetically small, but there is just
that hopeless gulf between the hus
band’s earnings and the family’s re
quirements which makes it seem im
perative that the wife should add her
mite.
There are thousands of such cases.
Living expenses have increased at
least 50 per cent, in the past five or
six years; the children who then need
ed little, now are in school and shoes,
clothing, books and supplies must be
provided; and the men’s wages have
not been increased, nor can they
work longer hours than they now
wearily put in. They, themselves,
do not realize the hardship so keenly.
If they bring their money home, they
contrast their own virtue with the
lapses of such of their acquaintances
who indulge in various personal ex
travagances, and are very compla
cent. They do not see why the table
should not afford the luxuries it once
did, or why they should not in every
other respect enjoy the same comfort.
It is the wife and mother who
schemes and plans, who sacrifices all
her own pleasures first, and even then
is confronted with that ever widen
ing gap between what they need and
what they can possibly buy.
Nevertheless, I do not much ap
prove the idea of earning money at
home. The woman who does
it, usually neglects herself, and
her home, for the sake of a
little money that is not ap
preciated by those for whom she
makes the sacrifice to earn it. Here,
Under the Vine and Fig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
again, the trained worker has all the
advantage of the untrained one. She
can come to the rescue in away that
means something, and by system and
management need not really sacri
fice anything, while the woman who
tries to keep the boarder, or make
dresses or trim hats or any other
thing that she fancies she should be
able to do, because these are femi
nine occupations, whether she has
had special training or not, comes to
grief. Then there’s a difference be
tween “real money” and “pin mon
ey” that everybody understands.
They respect the one, and rather
sneer at the other. So the wife who
wears herself out cooking, sweeping,
scrubbing, washing, ironing and tak
ing care of children, and, in addition,
by excess of energy, and at the ex
pense of injured eyes and slighted
sleeps, earns a few dollars by plain
sewing, for instance, may be very
sure that her money will be eagerly
accepted for the taxes, or the rent;
but that her husband will, as a rule,
be just as puffed up over “support
ing” her as though he had originally
taken her from some almshouse.
No, I cannot altogether feel that
it is just the best thing for a woman
to make herself in anywise responsi
ble for the family living. That is
the man’s particular business, so
ciety according him many other priv
ileges in exchange for his bread-win
ning capacity. He may, for instance,
under the law, decide the place of
residence, and although that may
take the wife away from all her fam
ily and friends, and give her many
a homesick hour, she must yield all
her former ties for the sake of his
business interests.
Still, I have the keenest sympathy
for the woman who wants to make
possible a more comfortable home, or
better educated children, or any oth-

always a blameless one, seldom is it
mere vanity. And if anyone has
solved this problem of “making ends

WANTED: A BETTER SOCIAL
BUDGET.
Has society a budget in which it
enters, in the order of their import
ance, the items for which it wishes
to provide? If it has, the items are
evidently badly arranged, and some
of the most important ones seem to
have been omitted altogether. To
illustrate: One would expect to find
in any well-ordered social budget
the item, “Mother’s Care for Chil
dren” well up toward the top, among
the earliest entries, next in order
perhaps to “Food for the Race” and
“Shelter for the Race.” As a mat
ter of fact, family incomes go to the
man and the man receives the same
wages or salary for a given amount
of work whether he is married or
not, whether his wife spends her
time in going to the theater and “at
the silent sacrament of bridge” or in
carefully rearing her children. A
nurse or a hired housekeeper receives
for her labor a fixed sum of money
which is hers to hoard or to spend;
to use during her lifetime or to save
and will away at her death. The
mother receives no such income. If
she lives to bring up her children she
dies penniless unless she has been so
fortunate as to inherit property; if
she dies while her children are
young, her husband is likely to give
as a reason for marrying again the
fact that he can not afford to hire a
housekeeper for them. And yet we
insist that no professional service can
equal the labor that is performed by
wife and mother. If we really be
lieve this, we would better insist also
that society speedily make a new
budget in which the provision for
this work shall be commensurate
with the importance which is attach
ed to it in ordinary conversation, in
sociological literature, in song, in
story and in art. —LaFollette’s.

AN EFFECTIVE VISITING GOWN
IN BROWN CLOTH.
Nos. 8585 and 8580
Dark brown broadcloth with trim
ming of velvet banding was used for
this stylish model. The lower sleeve
portions and chemisette are of Prin
cess “allover” lace. The skirt has a
deep yoke portion, and is lengthened

waist closes at the side below the
round yoke. The waist is cut in 5
sizes: <32, 34, 36, 38, 40 inches, bust
measure, and requires 4 3-4 yards of
32-inch material for the 36-inch size.
The skirt is cut in sizes 22, 24, 26,
28 and 30 inches, waist measure, and

terial for the 2 4-inch size.
A pattern of this illustration will
be mailed to any address on receipt
of 10 cents in stamps or silver. Be
sure to give the size wanted, so we

Address
JEFFERSONIAN PATTERN DEPT.,
Thomson, Ga.
the houses of Parliament in London
raises the question of who is lawless
and ridiculous —the British authori
ties or the women?
Why not let the women present
their case with decorum and depart
in peace?
Has it become necessary to guard
the British houses of Parliament
with an army against committees of
the women of the realm?
They are British subjects, the same
as the men, only they can’t vote. And
they wish to vote, and only ask for
a hearing.
All the uproar is because they are
denied the privilege of being heard.
While The American does not ap
prove of violence on the part of wo
men —we ask in all common sense
why these committees are not courte
ously received and given a respectful
hearing?
State legislatures in this country
have given the ladies their field day.
And we have no such outbreaks as
those disgracing the British metro
polis.
It is not a question of the suffrage
for women at this moment so much
as it is one of giving their contentions
free hearing and debate.
The police club is eloquent, wield
ed against men. But it has no mean
ing against the cause of women. The
British Government’s answer is fu
tile and fatuous.
We hope that this folly will be re
alized because, however unwomanly
and impossible feminine violence may
be, the retort of police violence to
the plea of their logic is a disgrace
to civilization.—N. Y. American.
“I wish 1 could,” sighed the Well-Read
Man.
“Wish you could what?”
“Divorce them.”
“Whpm?”
“Nobody. Just those adjectives.”
“What adjectives ?”
“I am so tired of seeing them togeth
er. Honestly, in nine cases out of ten
that one of them is used the other trails
along, too. It’s absurd!”
“What two adjectives do you mean?”
