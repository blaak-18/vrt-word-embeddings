I HURTS TFHER FEEINGS.
The Foster organs over the State
are very much hurt over the fact
that the Republicans have agreed
to support the Populist ticket in
the approaching State election.
The Baton Rouge Truth(l) and
our own Enterprise are exceeding
ly sore about it, but it should be
remembered that they are also dis
Spleased with any other opposition
to Foster; and they are wise in
such displeasure for such opposi
tion threatens to knock over the
. pie-counter at which they are fat
tening.
The only thing for which we can
blame them, is contradicting them
selves in their own papers and
thus bringing disrepute upon the
profession to which we belong.
Our Enterprise kindly donates
over 3 columns to our party last
week, one-half of which is given
to the telegraphic report of our
Alexandria Conference. This re
port, thanks to the instructions of
the Picayune to its correspondents,
is a very fair one, and but for the
want of space we should have pub
lished same in this paper; so we
are thankful to the Enterprise for
* that part of its space.
But the column editorial com
ment thereon is stultifying to high
minded journalism. It starts out
by saying : "It will be observed
that as a result of that conference,
a fusion between the two parties
has been affected (effected) for the
purpose of a division of the State
and local oflices."
Now we do not believe that any
fair-minded person who under
stands common English, will "ob
serve" any "fusion" or any "com
bination" whatever from the print
ed report of the result of that con
ference. Here is the report of the
Daily Picayune as printed in the
Enterprise, and it, squarely con
tradicts the Enterprise's editorial,
quoted above:
"At this conference held to-day. It was
decided that the populists would, at
their State convention, to be held early
in January, name such a State ticket as
5 will mnet the approval of all elements
in the State opposed to Fosterism. The
personnel of sech a ticket was not eon
idered, but is to be left to future ac
tions. The campaign committee of the
p oplists has concluded to call the
ctts convenotion of the ap t Alex
andria on Jan. 8 next, the epublican
State convention will doubtless be call
D ed a few days later in Januarv. The
nomlists will name the State ticket at
t hlr coavenatlon and the Republicans
I will name a State tiekM at their con
vention ; there will be no indorsemeat
by either party of the other ticket."
This part of the report was su
tbentiested by both the Republi
eans and the Popublists, and gives
no evidence of fusion or of eom
bination. The Republicans sim
B ply offer to support our ticket
- when named, in order to rid the
I State of Fosterism, and to save
I more than half the people of the
State from diranehisememt.
The Baton Bouge Truth, though
very sore over the prospect of
losing its met job, disputes the
Enterpriaq by saying: "The State
'ticketitobe made up of Popu
lat who are to be supported by
the Republcan party. This much
has leaked out from the meeting
held behind cosed doors last
week."
SThe RepubliHean party has sim
ply deaded to stop playing second
iddleto the Democratic partyin
this State. Strengtenedsadina
measure purled by the addition
of a large element of white peo
p1. from the Democratic rLanks, it
desires by spporting the People' 1
party, the only disetively white
party inthe State, to overthrow,
theersof fraud ad ballot thiev

POPULIST NEWS.
Populist vote in Utah : 800 last
t year, 2500 this year.
The People's party is still stick
ing to silver.
Both the old frauds have forgot
ten it in the wild scramble for of
fice.
The Populists of Calcasieu par
ish and their organ, the brilliant
and courageous New Road, sat
down on the railroad tax, and
straightway it was buried.
The Populists in Winn parish
have at last named their parish
ticket as follows : Representative,
D. E. James ; Clerk, R. C. Jones ;
Sheriff, J. H. Crawford, the lat
ter for re-election, which is a de
served tribute to Mr. Crawford
for his sterling worth as an officer.
Grant parish Populists have
nominated a good ticket and one
that will win. For Representative,
A. W. Stewart; Clerk, W. L.
Shackelford; Sheriff, W. W.
Smith; Coroner, Dr. Milton A.
Dunn. Of these Mr. Shackelford
is for re-election and is a splendid
selection.
The Ex. Com. of the People's
party of Ouachita, has called a
parish convention to meet in Mon
roe, Dec. 28th, to select delegates
to our State convention. The Pop
ulist voters of that parish were
urged to keep out of the Demo
cratic primaries. It was decided
to postpone the nomination of a
parish ticket to some time in Feb
ruary next.
Jackson parish People's party
have put the following cstrong par
ish ticket in the field: For Rep
resentative, I. D. Hogan ; Clerk,
W. R. Carroll; Sheriff, John
Grigsby. This is an exceptional
ly strong ticket, and will have a
walk-over m the coming election.
W. R. Carroll stands for re-elec
tion, and will doubtless have no
opposition.. .
The People's Call is a "brand
new" Pcpulist paper just out, in
the "Florida Parishes," and des
tined to be the organ for the Pop
ulists in that section, where they
are already very strong. That
old staunch worker E B. Dees, is
editor, and as we expected, he gets
up a first class, newsy, orthodox
paper. Located in Amite City,
the best town in that part of the
State, and backed by a strong and
patriotic constituency, the People's
Call will soon be a power in our
, growing party.
Tangipahos Populists meet in
convention in Amite City, Dec.
93rd, to select delegates to the
State nominating convention to be
held at Alexandria, January 8th
next. They will also put out a
full pariah ticket a httle later on.
The Populist candidate for State
Senator in that district (17th)
has already been nominated, and
is B. B. Dee., of Washington par
ish, a very worthy gentlemen who
will be elected.
We have heard from private
sources, that several of the dele
teomposing the Populist Ju
il Convention, held at Wmfeld
turday, 28rd, became displeased
and withdrew from the body, hold
ing a side meeting, endorsing
Judge Oeo. Wear for re-election.
-Jacksonian.
We also heard that it was no
convention at all. The Judicial
Ex. Com. fearing to let the mat
ter get out of their hands, resolved
thlemselves into a so-called conven
tion, and proceeded to put out a
kind of a ticket. Such arbitrary
and unpreoedented methods de
serve a sharp rebuke at the polls,
and will doubtles get it.
The New BRond, organ ot the
Populists in Calcaaien parish,
comm out strongly indorsing our
State Ex. Com., Chairman A. B.
Booth, of New Orleans, for Gov
ernor on our ticket. Mr. Booth
is a conservative and able man,
and for over 8 years as chairman,
has conducted the affairs of our
pamty with igal ability, shrewd
me and. snooe, and would make
a spledid governor, but we think
Lbewll prefer to bold his present
Desorts will do their utmost
tnfrighte thoee peopt who love
to be hoodwinked, by telling them
that there was a "uiger in the
woodpile" at the Alexandria Con
ference. How long will the peo
ple be fooled by the hypocritical
cries of white supremacy from a
party that has stolen negro votes.
- for a living for 20 years, elected
and appointed negroes to office, and
- positively refused numerous offers
it to submit its ticket to the white
.t people of any parish or district in
d the State I
We want to say right here, for
. the benefit of those people who
h might be fooled by the misrepre
, sentations of the Democratic press,
; that there is no fusion between the
- Populist and Republicans, or any
body else. The Republicans sim
d ply offered to support our State
ticket in the hope of defeating the
suffrage amendment and the Foster
e counting machine. Now, does any
e Populist want to prevent the Re
publicans from doing this ? Fos
ter's henchmen do, we know, so as
to leave something to hide their
stealing behind.
