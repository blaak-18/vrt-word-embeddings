ZETTERJ F<RjOM THE PEOPLE
FOREIGN MISSIONS AGAIN.
Flowery Branch, Ga., March 12, 1909.
Hon. T. E. Watson,
Dear Sir: We are glad you have
seen tit to call attention to the church
grafters. We have been bored no
little in days past by said grafters.
The preacher doctors (or doctor
preachers, as the case may be) don’t
wish for us laymen to do any think
ing or talking on the subject of mis
sions—just pay and hush.
We have been wanting to know
how many dollars and cents it costs
to convert a Chinaman and keep him
converted, including board and school
ing while at it.
Will some one of our numerous
boards make the calculation and let
us know through the Jeffersonian?
We think we know the meaning of
the word “patriot”—one who loves
and works for his country more than
for self. In days gone by, you, Mr.
Watson, endeared yourself to the
great middle class hy your sound
logic and plain, out-spoken principles.
Equal and exact justice, without spe
cial privileges. No right-thinking
man would oppose that.
Once there were some 70,000 of
us in line, I mean of us Populists, in
Georgia. There are a whole lot of us
yet, and though not so well organized
we hold the balance of power today in
Georgia, and whichever way we go
the iState goes.
More anon,
Alfred Maddox.
READS MAGAZINE FROM “RIV
ER TO RIVER.”
Atlanta, Ga.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
Dear Sir: Enclosed you will find
check for $1.58 for which please send
to W. M. Fain, No. 51 Elizabeth St.,
Atlanta. Ga., one copy of your
‘ i Waterloo. ’ ’
I am sure if it is anything like
as good as your Napoleon or Story
of France 1 shall be delighted with
it, for they are the best works I ever
read.
I am a great admirer of your
Jeffersonian Magazine and read it
from “kiver” to “kiver,” and your
article on Foreign Missions struck me
exactly, and you are right in every
particular in what you say.
I lived in a foreign country two
years, where the woods were full of
missionaries and know from observa
tion that you are right in your views.
Wishing you much success in all of
your undertakings I beg to remain,
Yours very truly,
W. M. Fain.
DEMOCRACY AS TAUGHT TODAY
IS A STRANGER TO JEF
FERSON’S TEACHINGS.
Hillsboro, Texas, Route 7.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson,
My Dear Sir: 1 want to say Amen
to what you have to say about the
missionary work in the January num
ber, and your reply to the Christian
Advocate in last issue of Jeffersonian.
It does seem to me that when people
start away from the plain teaching
of God’s word there is no telling to
what extreme they will go. I have
been a reformer for thirty years, both
religiously and politically. I want us
to come back to the old apostolic
teaching, the old paths. Democracy
as taught today is a stranger to Jef
ferson’s teaching.
I say let us have that conference,
reorganize and keep the vestal fires
burning. I believe if you could make
a few speeches in Texas and get your
papers scattered over this country,
Texas would get back in line where
she once stood in Populism.
Why the wage earner can vote for
either of the old parties I cannot see.
There is not a thing on earth in it
for them. Hence, if I do not have
a man running that advocates the
true Jeffersonian principles, I just
stay at home.
There are many things I would
love to say, but I must not trespass
on your good time. While I live I
expect to read your papers; I cannot
do without them. I have been read
ing them from the first issue. I file
the Magazine away, the weekly I read
and give them to the Democrats, and
they are opening their eyes, too. I am
your sincere friend to the end,
D. C. Wornel.
A MUCH APPRECIATED LETTER.
Helena, Ga., March 11, 1909.
Hon. T. E. Watson,
Dear Sir: When you are dead
probably there will be many who will
be ready to eulogize your name and
raise a monument to your memory,
but I shall not be one of them. I
shall keep silence then, but now while
you are living and your heart sus
ceptible to pain and pleasure I would
like to bring my simple flowers (the
best from my little modest and ob
scure garden) and place them at your
feet. I have passed my thirtieth
milestone and know the yalue of a
kind word, also the chill of censure
and distrust.
It does me good to know I am liv
ing in the day of such men as your
self, who stand for the good of the
masses, who are ever ready to defend
the oppressed, no matter how lowly
they may be, and who hold honor
dearer than life.
I have always imagined I possessed
a considerable degree of patriotism,
but I, somehow, have no desire to
aid in the fight for woman’s suffrage.
The height of my ambition is to
raise my five children to be honorable
and useful citizens, and if in later
years my two boys stand for “Toni
Watson” principles, at the polls or in
legislative halls, I think I shall have
served my country well.
Yons faithfully,
Dosia Aiken Yaun.
LET REFORMERS CONSOLIDATE
AND FIGHT UNDER ONE FLAG.
Oxford, Fla., March 3, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
Dear ’Sir: I want to compliment
you for the good and faithful fight
you made in Georgia during the last
campaign for Jeffersonian principles.
I have had the pleasure of voting for
you twice for president and I have
heard you make two speeches. I shall
always stand by you and the principles
which you advocate. But shall we
□effersonlan
always fight in vain? I would be
glad if every party in the South
would come together as one party.
This has got to be in order for us
to ever get any relief, otherwise we
will remain divided as we are until
the money power will seize us in their
clutches to our untold misery and
woe.
Now would it be wise to call a con
ference and let the leaders of all the
whipped parties come together and
reason together? The Bible tells us
that we must reason together. Let all
the parties go with the determination
to give and to take, and if we can’t
get what we have always contended
for, let us get as near that as possible
to be in harmony with all and then
let all the parties consolidate under
one name, different from any that we
now have, and let us all fight under
one flag as one united band. Then
by the help of the eternal God, vic
tory will surely be ours. Just stoo
and ask yourself one question, How
can you expect a single man to quit
the Republican and Democratic ranks
and join us when we are divided at
all points of the compass?
You will find enclosed money order
and coupon filled out for the weekly
Jeffersonian. I am yours until the
end.
G. W. Baker.
WILL TRY TO GET TO TEXAS.
Stephenville, Texas, Feb. 20, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
Dear Sir: This is to certify that the
Erath County Farmers’ Union in ses
sion, knowing your great service to
the agricultural people in originating
the R. F. D. system and to labor in
the Automatic Car-Coupler Act and
the Pinkerton investigation and to the
cotton producer in the Jute Bagging
fight and also knowing your great
interest in the welfare, of the Southern
farmer and your transcendent ability
as an author and writer as well as a
speaker, urgently request you to make
a date to address the people of Erath
county some time in July, 1909, or
such other time as you may be able
to visit Texas.
Very respectfully,
G. E. Morton,
Pres. Erath County Farmer's ’ Union,
Dublin, Texas.
H. M. Courtney,
Secretary, Harbin, Texas.
FOR A “MODERN DEMOCRATIC
PARTY.”
Livermore, Colo.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson,
Dear Sir: I have been very much
interested in the last few issues of
your Weekly Jeffersonian, and espe
cially in the letters from the people.
I must confess that I was almost
dumbfounded at the result of the last
election, and have been groping in
the dark ever since, look
ing and hoping for some
word or sign that would give a ray
of hope for new life to a real
People’s Party movement, such as is
advocated by the Omaha platform.
Now, sir, let me suggest that, in my
opinion, it is no fault of name of
our party that caused the small vote
in the last election, but the cause is
traceable directly to the hypocrisy
of the Democratic Party and Bryan
ism. A great many people looked, on
Mr. Bryan as being sincere and as
being a real live people’s man, while
others boosted him for the purpose
of keeping down the Populist move
ment. But then our real weakness
lay in the lack of leaders, money and
newspapers, or our inability to get
our cause before the people. Now,
as for me, I don’t see any need of two
Republican parties in the country.
One is too many. The Republicanism
of Grover Cleveland’s last administra
tion brought the hardest times on this
country that I have any remembrance
of. The mint was congested, railroad
building and almost all public enter
prises at a standstill, and here in the
West a cow that now will sell for
from $25 to S6O would in those days
bring but from $lO to S2O, and houses
could hardly be given away. So after
McKinley was elected, and times got
better, we thought that the Demo
cratic party was dead, but with the
aid of Bryanism and deception, they
have managed to keep the old thing
kicking, but they had to steal our
People’s Party thunder to do it.
Now it seems to me that Bryanism
has had its day and will never be
able to gain a respectable hearing
again, so let us reorganize at as early
a date as possible so as to be in good
working order by 1912, and if it be
comes necessary to change the name
I will suggest this name, The Modern
Democratic Party.
With best wishes,
P. P. Thinker.
SHOULD NOT WE TAKE CARE
OF OUR OWN CHILDREN
FIRST?
Chunky, Miss., March 8, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson,
Dear Old Friend: I think I may call
you such as I am one of the “Old
Guard’’ and have been in thorough
sympathy with you and your work
ever since you came into the political
arena. May God’s richest blessing
rest upon you and your labors, and I
hope and believe I will see the day
when the full fruition of your unsel
fish labor will fully materialize.
Until such time may come I shall
continue to keep in touch with you
by means of the “Jeffersonian.” I
could not do without it.
As to the much mooted “Mission”
question, I am glad to see you take
the stand you do, but it is nothing
more than should have been expected
from one in thorough touch with the
want and misery, degradation and
ruin so very prevalent in our own
land. It seems to me that the recent
tumultuous upheaval in foreign mis
sionary work is sadly missing the
mark, and while there are those who
are honestly sincere, the vast ma
jority, I am persuaded, care more for
personal notoriety than they do for
the lucky beneficiaries of their money.
Almost in the very shadow of our
glittering church spires sit the ragged,
hungry and cold thousands of our own
pure Caucasian blood, whose lives are
one endless grind of misery and
despair, and about the only comfort
and help they get comes through the
once despised “Salvation Army/’
