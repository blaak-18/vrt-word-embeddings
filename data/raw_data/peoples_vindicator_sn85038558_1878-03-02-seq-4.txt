Colonel Ingersoll on Chlld-Whlpping.
The children of poverty! My heart
bleeds when I think of them; the chil
dren simply covered by a rag; the chil
dren of famine and of starvation; the
children of drunkenness and the children
of crime, flotsam and jetsam upon the
wild, rude sea of life; the children in
alleys ; the children that crouch in cor
ners when they hear the unsteady step
of a drunken brute of a father; tbe cllil
dren, little babies with drinking moth
ers; the children, too, of the rich, that
have no liberty-these little children
that are crushed, that are trampled up
on, that are frightened. I pity them all
from the.bottom of my heart.
What right have y,.u to tyranize over
a child ? I have very little respect for a
man that cannot govern a child without
brute force. Think of whipping clhil
dreal Wh", they say that children tell
lies. Yes, cowardice is the mother of
lies-tyranny is the father of jlies. Sup
pose a man who is as much larger than
you as you are larger than a live-year
old child, should come at you with a role 1
in his hand, "Who broke that plate ?"
You would tremble, your knees wouldt
knock together, and you would swear
you never saw the plate, or that it wias
cracked when you got it.
!Think of a member of the Board of Ex-r
change whipping one of his chjldren for
prevaricating ! Think of a lawyer heat-r
ing his own flesh and blood becnuse Ih. t
evaded the truth I Think of a dealer in
stocks punishing his child for, setting
afloat ralse reports! What an inconsist
ency! Think of it! if you should here a
after whip your child, I wish you could f
have a photograph taken when doing so, e
with brows corrugated with anger, your lI
cheeks red with wrath, and the little one a
shrinking, tremboling, erouching and beg- i
ging!
If this child shonld,.happen to die,
wouldn't it be sweet in autumn when the
maple leaves are turning to gold. and t'
when the scarlet vines run like a sad re
gret out of the earth-wouldn't it be de
lightful to go and sit on the mound that ii
covered the flesh you had beaten, and c
look at 'the photograph of yourself in the tIl
act of whipping the child?
Now, think of it; think of it; and if all
I say to-night will save one blow from the u
tendemilesh of infancy, I am more than b
paid. p
I have kpown men to drive their own "
children from their doors, and then get h
down on their knees and ask God to a
watch ever them. I will never ask God Ii
to do a favor for a child of mine u hile I
can do it; never. Another thing, there is "
nothing in this world like being honest
with tese children. Do not pretend you n
arerperfection; you are not; and if one of It
them happens to tell a story, do not let on bi
as if the whole world was going to burst. til
Tell them honestly you have told thous- al
snds of thenm.

of tihe celebrated "Duchess 97," and

Glnders in horses is one of the fo
', worst diseases to which the horse is
I subject, and it is readily transmissa
b ile to man, in whom it is almost in
variably fatal. It is engendered by
- impure air, hard work and low diet. -
Prevention-Tine nasal discharge may
, communicate the disease to a sound
h horse which is afterward placed in
- tie stall formerly occuilied by the F
diseased one. Tie discarge adheres
to the mnanger and other parts of tine
wood work of the stall. The cleaning I
of tine ninanger and other parts of the
stall may be affected by scrubbing Ti
them with boiling water, with a strong
solution of potash and soda, and with
a solution of chloride of lime, seing a
snovelful of it to a pailful of water.
How to Bleed a Horse. -
Bteeding is generally done in tie
jugular vein with a broad-bladed Ian- -a
cet; and when tine vein is sufficiently
pressed and secured, so as to cause it
to swell, then the point of the lancet
is sent in with the left hand, and cnt- fox
ting upward, makes all tile opening
necessary. When sufficient blood is
taken tine cut outght to be squeezed
together and fastened with a pin. By
pressing the vein below the wound
the blood will shoot out in a stream
and fall clear into the bnncket ready FI
to receive it.
Rotation of Crois. FI
'rTe next crop lifter corn may be PE
potatoes, barley or oats, and in tine cal
fall put in winter wheat and seed Det
down to timnothny and sow tine clover
seed in the Spring, in March, while -
tine surface of the soil freezes at night
and thaws by day, wWich opens the
soil and lets the clover-seed into the KE
ounmerous little ci-acks. Another way B
is to sow tine clover seed in April and TC
run a tine-toothed marrow over tine SA
land both ways. If tie soil is light
the harrowing will benefit the wheat, 3
eradicate the weeds and cover tine ,
clover seed. But this relation re
quires an application of manore to T
each crop in order to produce good, clai
