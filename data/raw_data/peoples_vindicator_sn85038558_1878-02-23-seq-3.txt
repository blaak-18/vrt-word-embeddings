We haive tllked to every body
aro'nid us, and they are of the same
opinion. 'Tlheir cry is, no comlpro
raise ! and lthese ainendments are
clearly conplromises. They stop
short of what is demainded .by the
people --and reqinired by their sit eno
tion. They dally itith evils instead l
of icorrectig them. 'lThe color ques
tion is settled by destioyini pnhle t
schliiols. T'rhe power of the legisla
ture is inot restricted, on the conitrary
it is eiilairgcd.
These alllendients will be beaten, I
for if they should not, ieyv will e I
used as aln aiglilient against a Con- (
titulitionlal Conlvention for years to I
come.
No ! The iings rmust lie destroyed.
We lmust have a l)Democratic Consti- i
tultionl, and the Iront step in thlit
dir(etionn, is lhe defieat of the plroplo
sedll aiutellnd nts. Our llple will

This is a nice way to act "refolim"
-paying Blunt who never was elect
ed, and who filed hi.E colntest, which,
according to tile "agreement" he was
not to do. Robinson, of St. Landry,
failed us in calling the ayes and noes.
The D)octor is "devlish sly," and got
in one of his dodges on us. HIowev
er, the- black list must embrace the
whole Senate.
We miost particularly request the
citizens of this Senatorial District,
who are on the verge of starvation
to rememnber that the "Conservative
element" paid a scouulndrel who had
no right to the money nearly two
thousand dollars for resisting the
honest and rightful goverlnmentil of
the State. Truly, rascality has its A
"rewards."
