Peoria. 111.—“ Ku Klux Klan in Bit
ter Fight.” So read the headlines in
a local paper last Saturday evening.
You could almost feel the way the
editors grinned as they doped it out
thus. However, all they had to say
was not news to Klansmen. It was
the old Clarke and Simmons affair
and was stale news to the Klan.
What these two men can do to undo
such an organization is a laughable
matter.
Not many days since this same
paper published a story that Clarke
was calling a meeting of representa
tives of all the Klans in the United
States —and what wonderful things
he was going to do at this meeting.
But now they have forgotten all
about that.
The Klan does not deny the ex
istence of these two men, nor their
present antagonism toward the Klan
But that this is a matter that will
divide and kill the Klan is a farce.
The great body of men lined up in
this movement is not going to be
swayed from their avowed purpose
by the selfishness of a few individuals
As American citizens, the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan are interested
in matters pertaining to our govern
ment above everything else, and every
real Klansman must appreciate the
value and worth of citizenship with
all that it stands for, and for what it
means, not only to himself, but to his
children after him.
This is a government of the people,
for the people and by the people, and
to that end we desire serious consid
eration and action on the part of
every real American.
The organization IS NOT PARTI
SAN in any sense of the word. It is
made up of men of different political
faiths, but as American citizens, and
members of this great organization,
we have a right to demand of our
political parties absolute loyalty and
interest to American principles and
ideals, and we have a duty to see
that political parties enunciate in
their several platforms those prin
ciples so clearly and definitely that
they can be understood by all —and
to that end we propose to be con
stantly vigilant and active in par
ticipating in the conventions of the
political parties.
We shall see to it that the princi
ples embodied in resolutions find ex
pressions in political platforms, so
that when they are enacted into the
laws of our state and nation they
will adhere to the benefit and welfare
of our people in the maintenance of
Americanism.
We absolutely and positively are
not interested in the success of any
p rticular party or individual, but we
are deeply interested in the making
of just laws and in the selection of
men of such type and character as
will give us a guaranty of the en
forcement of the same in the interest
of good citizenship.
It is altogether fitting that those
men who are affiliated with the Re
publican party or the Democratic
party, or any other, are of the type
and character that can be depended
upon to do their whole duty without
fear or favor.
We shall give attention to the men
who are named for office to the end
that we may have constructive tim
ber to select from as our officers who
will measure up to the highest stand
ards of efficiency.
There are certain elements that we
have a right to expect to find in
Who instigated the Mer Rouge
“scandal” which came to such a piti
ful fiasco?
Who started the litigation in New
York, Kansas, Georgia and elsewhere

Who began the row at Carnegie?

Oklahoma ?

who are disgruntled 'because their
former powers have been Invested in
others. That the Klans in general
are back of Imperial Wizard Evans
all over the country is unquestioned.
There is no time for internal straggle
and strife. These men have set their
faces toward things that are such
greater moment that they are not
going to be diverted by these petty
trials, which are merely no more than
“growing pains” in the organization.
This only serves to keep the Klan
in the eyes of the public, where
otherwise the newspapers would not
say anything about it. Struggle is
strengthening and if there was not
strong opposition there would be
danger that the organization might
lose some of its vigilance and grow
“flabby” and unwiedly.
If Clarke and Simmons did not ac
commodate, the Klansmen might have
to do something out of line themselves
to get any attention at all. Let all
newspapers be assured that this is
“of the wave and not the rock.”
KUN NOT PARTISAN
(The Western American)
those men who are selected for a pub
ic service.
They shall be clean, honest, de
pendable, capable men, loyal to the
great fundamental principles of our
government, and this loyalty to the
Constitution shall be absolutely be
yond question.
If Klansmen will give proper atten
tion to the above suggestions, we will
have no reason to regret the outcome.
Gentlemen of the Ku Klux Klan and
Ladies particularly, the matter of
GOVERNMENT is the most import
ant thing that touches our lives as
citizens, and if we are negligent, we
cannot expect the best government
from administration.
We have no desire to dictate polit
ical preferment when it comes to the
matter of political party—neither
would we have our members with
draw from the political parties of
their choice to the extent that they
become non-partisan, as this would
make impossible participation in
those things that are of supreme in
terest to us. On the other hand we
would have every Klansman to be
so zealous and so jealous of his party
that he would not suffer it to be used
in any way against the higher inter
est and greatest good of his country,
and we would have him so earnest
th?t he would see to it that men of
the proper type and character are the
standard-bearers of his party.
When these two elements are not
found in his party, a Klansman
should possess that hardiness of man
hood and sturdy devotion to Ameri
canism that he would not for one
moment hesitate in casting his bal
lot in the interest of these 100 per
cent ideals in'which we believe and
for which we surely stand.
We should call into service none
but men of the very highest character.
We shall expect to support only can
didates who put the common welfare
of the men and women of America
above party success. We are inter
ested in seeing that real 100 per cent
service is rendered.
During recent years politics indeed
has become so corrupt that today one
scarcely can recognize one party
from another.
In the Ku Klux Klan party politics
isn’t cutting much of a figure—it is
the man we are looking after and the
principles for which he stands.

THE KU KLUX KUN
AND MASUNRY
DR. WILLIAM F. KUHN, in “Square
and Compass.”
It is very fortunate that the propa
ganda started by the enemies of Free
masonry to create the impression that
the Ku Klux Klan is an extraneous
organization of Freemasonry has re
ceived credence, and it is doubly un
fortunate that some grand masters
and grand lodges have been caught
by this propaganda and have been
used as the proverbial monkey to pull
the Romanist chestnuts out of the
fire.
The Ku Klux Klan has no connec
tion with Freemasonry whatever.
The Klan is able to defend itself, and
does not need a defense by Masonic
orators or the Masonic press. It is
organization independent of Free
masonry and needs no Masonic assis
tance; neither must Freemasonry
proscribe it.
Freemasonry should attend strictly
to its own business and not meddle
with or in the business of other or
ganizations.
Not a Klansman
I am not a member of the Klan, but
I am not willing to denounce it, as the
philosophy of history is that all or
ganized agencies or fraternities must
establish the reason and justice for
their existence or they will die per
maburely.
Freemasonry teaches the Father
hood of God and the brotherhood of
man. It therefore recognizes that
every human being, whatever his race
or nationality may be, is entitled to
all the rights and privileges that a
civilized nation may offer. It recog
nizes that a man’s religion is sacred,
be he a Protestant, Romanish, Jew or
Mohammedan. There can be no pro
scription for “conscience’ sake.”
But we must clearly recognize a
“religious belief’ from a “religio-po
litical belief.” ’ Freemasonry, while
recognizing the greatest liberty to
rights, privileges, and religion to
every man, does not and cannot toler
ate any religio-political propaganda.
That is subversive of the rights and
privileges of a free people, or that is
unpatriotic; a scheming to convert
the religion or right of the people to
its special use or purposes.
Every Mason’s Right
In the United States any religio
political effort that is not American,
not patriotic, but whose efforts are
fostered and propagated to establish
a leligious hierarchy, must meet with
resistance by every liberty-loving
Freemason. Any organization, be it
Freemasonry, Klan, or any society
that does not measure up to 100 per
cent American as understood by the
founders of our government is un-
American, unpatriotic and must be
met, not by violence or unlawful act,
but at the ballot box.
The panacea for anarchy, sovietism,
or religio-political efforts is the ballot.
Will Freemasons use it, or will the
politic Freemason betray his trust?
Every Freemason has the right to
join any organization that is not sub
versive of the moral law, that is pa
triotic and stands for not only obed
ience to law but enforcement of law.
If such are the purposes of the Klan
it is worthy of commendation; if it
is otherwise, it is unworthy.
By its acts it will be justified or
condemned.

A WOMAN’S PLACE

A woman’s place, I do maintain,
Is in the home, and much dissension
Could be escaped if she’d refrain
From things beyond her compre
hension.

To comprehend I often grope;
I find them hard to understand,
So how can any woman hope to?
To vote I’m never at a loss,
Though public questions often bore
me!
Each year I simply place my cross
The way my father did before me.
Now take my wife; a worthy spouse,
For whom I have a great affection,
She’s quite a treasure round the
house,
Excepting just before election.
She reads each paper that arrives,
The tracts and pamphlets that in
fest one,
She knows the candidates and strives
To ascertain which one’s the best
one.
She knows the platforms, every word,
She studies all the campaign
speeches.
And what to me is most absurd
She votes the way her conscience
teaches.
I’ve tried to teach her how to vote,
In manner firm and pedagogic;
Each time some foolish speech she’ll
quote—
Some women simply have no logic.
And so I always shall maintain
Twould save much trouble and dis
sension
If women only would refrain
From things beyond theircomprehen

THE KLAN AGAIN “DISAPPEARING”
By JOHN A. JEFFREY Imperial Lecturer
Now comes that great Papal
weekly, The Literary Digest, for No
vember 24, 1928, and again proves
the Ku Klux- Klan to be at the van
ishing point. It reminds the thought
ful citizen of the time when Mark
Twain, traveling abroad, was report
ed dead. The big papers directed
heir correspondents to secure the
story of his death in full. Mark
heard it first and wired back: “The
reports of my death are greatly ex
aggerated.”
There are many politicians in the
country who would give their best
horse, or auto, to feel secure about
what the “Digest” says.
These Papal agents seem to for
get that, while they keep up the
chorus, “Who’s afraid?” the cool citi
zen can see their knees knock to
gether and hear their teeth chatter.
Strange is it not, that all these
solemn predictions concerning the
condition of the Klan eminate from
Papal Roman sources? Can’t they
see that all thoughtful people recog
nize it to be a Catholic fight (or
scare) and nothing else? Note the
papers quoted against the Klan on
page 13 of the “Digest” for Novem
ber 24. They are our old friends
who have denounced the Klan ever
since the Papal machine said
“Thumbs down!” They are set forth
■on the unlucky page (13) of the Pa
pal calamity howler. This is as it
should be.
The Ku Klux Klan is gaining at
the rate of 10,000 members per
week from the best people in Ameri
ca. It is educating and uniting these
people so that victory after * victory
is being won for righteous and clean
government in the United States.
Some of the Papal organs of misin
formation are loudly wailing about
the cowardice of politicians because
they will not denounce the Klan.
Some of them are lamenting the
strength of the Klan, while the
“Digest’ ’says it is melting away.

ciation meets, if it has a single one
THE PERIL OF NARCOTICS
A new peril is facing the people
of the United States—the peril of
narcotic addiction. The use of nar
cotics, especially among the young, is
increasing with alarming rapidity.
And it cannot be attributed to pro
hibition as many would try to make
us believe. It is not the whiskey ad
dicts who have been deprived of their
stimulant who are forming the drug
habit, but the young people—boys
and girls—who have never been ad
dicted to liquor.
Opium has been used for many
centuries. It became a menace to
Asia, especially China, under the ex
ploitation of a powerful trading com
pany. China finally passed a law
prohibiting its use. Chemists discov
ered how to make morphine from
opium about one hundred years ago.
This is being more commonly used
now than opium.
About fifty years ago a chemist
discovered how to make cocaine from
the leaves of the cocoa plant, a plant
that grows in Peru and other South
American countries.
In 1898 a chemist discovered how
to make heroin from opium, a drug
that is four times as powerful as
morphine.
These drugs were first used in the
practice of medicine; they were used
to alleviate pain and were thought to
be a great blessing to mankind.
It is said that addicts to these va
rious drugs now number millions in
the United States. Many of these
addicts formed the habit through
having the drug used by physicians
to alleviate pain. After using it for
a short time they found themselves
unable to stop and as a result became
confirmed drug users.
When once the habit is fixed the
addict considers his drug as para
mount. It becomes a matter of life
and death to him. In order to get it
he will lie, steal, rob, or even in ex
treme cases commit murder. It is
estimated that more than nine-tenths
of the murders, holdups and daring
robberies are committed by drug ad
dicts.
The Scripture says, “For the want
of knowledge my people perish.” It
was because of a lack of knowledge
that the larger portion of addicts
formed the habit. A magazine at
hand says, “Recruiting goes on
chiefly among the young. The aver
age age of the heroin addict is 23.
He must have been recruited before
he was 20. Peddlers are recruiting
in the schools. The method is very
simple. The young people are given
a ‘snow party.’ The ‘snow’ is heroin.
It is at first supplied free. Just a

It is noted in one of them re
cently that P. L. Campbell, presi

is to “wipe out the Elan.” Presi

of the great Protestant white orders

ties of “Father” E. V. O’Hara? Is

American and dangerous. Why
should Seattle have them ? Why
should any’ American support them?

stitutes a ‘party.’ Such a ‘party’
once a day will make an addict of a
high school boy or girl in a short
time.” The government report states
that a boy will become an addict in
side of ten days and a mature man
inside of 30 days.
These peddlers who give the “snow
parties” are addicts and are ped
dling in order to get a supply for
themselves. When one becomes ad
dicted to any of these drugs all
moral principle is gone, at least
when it involves the satisfying of the
craving for the drug. The drug user
is soon incapacitated for work and
the drug he must have, so he resorts
to any means to obtained it. The
narcotic trust, or “dope ring” has a
virtual monopoly of the narcotic sup
ply. Its members secure the drug
for a few dollars an ounce. They
chage the addicts more than a dollar
a grain, in most cases more than
SSOO an ounce.
Many of the drug peddlers work
for recruits among the pupils in the
public schools. The young people
have no idea what they are doing
when they begin to take a “whiff”
of cocaine or heroin. An investiga
tion has recently been made of 100
text books on physiology and hygiene
used in the public schools in the
United States. Out of 18 text books
widely used in high schools, “five
contain nothing whatever about nar
cotics.” In the other 13 text books
less than two papers, on an average,
is devoted to the consideration of the
subject. Only eight authors state
that opium is a narcotic drug; only
nine that its continued use results in
an almost unbreakable habit; only six
that certain “patent medicines” con
tain opium; only four that laudanum
is opium dissolved in alcohol; and
only four that paregoric is a dilute
solution of opium.
One thing that greatly helped in
bringing about prohibition was that
the school books gave the facts con
cerning the use of liquor, that it is
poisonous to the human system, etc.
Now we must begin a campaign
against habit-forming drugs. Par
ents and teachers should demand that
text books be used giving the truth
regarding such drugs. We are sure
that none of you want to see your
son or daughter a drug addict, but
thousands are becoming drug users
through these so-called “snow par
ties” or through the influence of some
other addict, and have the habit
formed before they are aware of its
terrible effects. May you who read
this do all you can to enlighten your
own children and others.—The Good

A PLEA FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS
Cornelia James Cannon in the At
lantic Monthly for November made a
brilliant plea for the public school as
against private institutions. Ex
cerpts from the article carry many
gems of thought for Klansmen:
American enthusiasm for public
education has been one of our most
distinguishing characteristics. No in
stitution we could show has been of
more interest to foreign visitors than
our public schools. Educational in
stitutions are no novelty to the civ
ilized nations; but a country aiming
to educate all its citizens at the ex
pense of the taxpayer is attempting
a task whose sgnificance has not
been lost on serious students of
western civilization.
We have given the gift of public
education as the best we had to offer
to our new brothers in the Pacific.
Are we within our own borders rec
reant to this great ideal that we
have attempted to realize on those
distant islands ? What are the facts ?
Is America, which has held the pub
lic or democratic school equal in im
portance to liberty and justice for all,
as prerequisite to her very existence,
ready to betray the one God, and
elect many brazen idols in his place?
The spread of private and sectarian
schools in this country in the last
twenty years has gone along with a
very great increase in the proportion
of citizens of alien traditions and
customs in our midst. The with
drawal from the public schools of
more and more of the children of
those already Americanized greatly
enhances the difficulty of making a
unit of this inchoate mass of human
beings that we call America. What
does such a shift of large numbers of
children signify? One can think of
it only as the recrudescence in this
country of the aristocratic, sectarian,
exclusive traditions of the older Eu
ropean civilizations —attitudes incom
patible with belief in democracy,
with groupings determined by indi
vidual ability and capacity independ
ent of inherited class or religious
associations.
Are not these groups of children
set apart for reasons antaganistic to
the purposes, and inimical to the up
building of a demorcracy ?
There seem to be three main cur
rents oT feeling which lie at the base
of this apostasy—all three types of
human exclusiveness. Exclusivesness
as a moral attitude is singularly out
of place in a country built up as ours
has been; and yet its disaffecting in
fluence has penetrated into the very
heart of our educational system. The
type of most importance as far as
numbers are concerned, is religious
exclusiveness. In a land where re
ligious freedom is supposed to be se
cure, specifically safeguarded by both
federal and state constitutions; where
religious tolerance itself has almost
the status of a universal creed; where
the fundamentals of the moral life—
honesty, loyalty, responsibility, con
sideration for others, respect for dif-
A Roman Catholic writer, one Gio
vanni Papini, is slated to lecture for
six weeks at Columbia University
during the summer of 1924. The
Italian Presbyterian Ministers’ Asso
ciation has protested to Dr. Butler
against the proposed lecture course
because of the “caustic opinion”
Papini has expressed in his writings
concerning America, but Dr. Butler
says the lecture course will be unaf
fected by the attack.
Papini has written, “America is the
land of millionaire uncles, the father
land of trusts, of skycrapers, of the
phonograph, of the electric street
car, of lynch law, of the insupport
able Washington, the boresome Emer
son, the degenerate Walt Whitman,
the sickening Longfellow, the angelic
Wilson, the philanthropic Morgan,
the undesirable Edison, and other men
of like quality.
“From which it can be deduced”
continues this Papist, “that the dis
covery of America, although achieved
by one who had moments of sanity,
was accomplished by the will of God
in 1492, as a repressive and preven
tive punishment for all the other
great discoveries of the Renaissance:
that is, gunpowder, humanism and
Protestantism.”
The discovery of America then was
permitted by the Almighty as a
punishment of mankind because of the
Reformation. It was a curse; and
naturally a part of the program of
the “true Church” is to destroy this
“curse.” This explains Rome’s atti
tude and program. We can see why
she condemns American laws and in
stitutions and constantly plots the
bverthrow 61 our form of govern
ment.
Pspini also refers to New York
with its 600 “pseudo-churches” (so
called churches) of their unhappy
land,” etc. Rome has only contempt
for America’s “pseudo-churches” and
its public schools. In her eyes the
only real Church is the one that fights
Prohibition, locks women behind stcne
walls and iron bars, keeps the masses
in ignorance, burns Bibles, etc. The
only school is one where a Longfellow
is classed as “sickening,” where
United States history is warped to
glorify Rome and disparage the early
patriots, where the teachers count
beads, worship old boness, etc.
Rome has brought desolation to
every land where she has had away.
ferencc cf opinion— are matters of
common agreement and are basic to
instruction in the public school sys
tem; hundreds of thousands of future
citizens are withdrawn from the pub
lic schools, and given an education
with those of their own faith, in
parochial schools of the different de
nominations.
By the very nature of things, such
training can not fail to be narrowing.
However, noble the religious ideals
aught, an American school which
has failed to be first an instrument
of democracy has failed fundamental
ly. In a theocracy such schools
would be appropriate; in a democracy
they are an anomaly. It is a sad
commentary on the trust that reli
gious leaders have in the holding
power of their own beliefs, that they
dare not spare their young believers
five hours a day for five days in the
week, for nine months in the year,
to a training for citizenship in com
pany with the varied groups which
go to the making of an American
community, lest they lose the faith
of the forefathers. * * *
What the newcomer to the prob
lems of education fails to observe is
that these schools all alike ignore
the purpose fundamental to education
in a democracy. The public schools
of our republic are not designed
primarily to train native ability, or
to follow the pupils interests of the
moment, or to provide a child with
the stimulus of unhampered work or
p ay. For the preservation of the
republic the potential citizens must
be taught the principles of dem
ocratic society, and learn to under
stand and to work with their fellow
sovereigns. The one place to accom
plish this is in the school, before ar
tifical divisions accompanying ma
turity arise, while the mutual rela
tions are simple and the consciousness
of likeness is keener than that of un
likeness. * * *
The abandonment of the dissoci
ated schools would be shortly reflect
ed in an improvement of our public
schools. The fact that some states
have debated the subject of the aboli
tion of all schools other than public,
and that one has legislated to that
effect, shows the direction of dem
ocratic thought in this country, and
reflects an attitude to whose signi
ficance we must not bind ourselves.
Is it possible that the time may come
when, in sheer self-defense, a dem
ocracy will have to resort to so un
desirable an expedient?
Meanwhile, the public schools are
here—the hope not alone of the chil
dren of the immigrants and of the
poor, but of all the children of the
republic. What these schools teach,
our country will be. No child can
witl out impoverishment be deprived
of participation in the training in
democracy that they give. We, par
ents of America, have our unique op
portunity to make ourselves partners
in the great venture of public educa
tion.—Dawn.

houses are tumbling down about her
ears, so she flees to this country for
refuge and then attempts to take
complete control of all our institu
tions.
The w’orld will not soon forget the
dogged resistance of the French at
Verdun, v r ho cried in their despera
tion, as the German hordes sought re
peatedly to overwhelm them, “THEY
SHALL NOT PASS.” In this fair
and of ours another army has arisen,
who, seeing the alien hordes that are
pouring into our country desperately
attempting to overthrow our laws and
institutions, are declaring with all
their manhood and their womanhood,
while swearing anew their eternal al
legiance to the Stars and Stripes and
to Almighty Gcd, “THEY SHALL
NOT PASS.” —The Good Citizen.
“Lord help me to live from day to day,
In p ueh a self-forgetful way,
That even when I kneel to pray,
My prayer shall be for—OTHERS.
Help me in all the work I do
To ever be sincere and true
And know that all I’d do for You
Must needs be done for—OTHERS
Let “self” be crucified and slain
And buried deep; and all in vain
May efforts be to rise again,
Unless to live for—OTHERS.
And when my work on earth is done
And niy new work in heaven’s begun,
May I forget the crown I’ve won,
While thinking still of—OTHERS.
O'hers, Lord, yes, others,
Let this my motto be,
Help me to live for others,
That I may live like Thee.”
