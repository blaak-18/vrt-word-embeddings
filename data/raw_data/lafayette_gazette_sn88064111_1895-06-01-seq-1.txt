Ii MOUTON,
JAKE RINGER'S SQUAW.
sty OBTRUBDE i. MILLAIB.
Carmen stood in the door-of the cook
house, her hand shading her eyes, and
gazed intently over the prairie toward
the west. The level rays of the sun
cast a rosy glow on her brown cheeks,
and gave a reddish tinge to the coal
black hair falling straight over her
shoulders, after the manner of married
women of .her tribe. Carmen was a
Spanish-Indian halfbreed, and a
beauty. She. was known at Star camp
as Jake Ringer's squaw. When Jake
came back from MI xico, after the
trouble about his knifing Longhaired
Ike had blown over, he brought this
woman with him.
Jake was not a man to be lightly
questioned. He kept his affairs to him
self, and his hand was ever ready to
his pistol when he was pressed beyond
his liking; but it was whispered among
the boys that he had stolen his dusky
bride from her mother's lodge on the
night that was to have consummated
her nuptials with Big Grizzly, the
young Apache chief. Jake was kind
to her in a fashion that decidedly as
tonished the men best acquainted with
his fierce and gloomy character. As
for Carmen, her soft, brown eyes fol
lowed her rough lord with the steady
faithfulness of a dog; no white wife
could have been so gentle or so helpful
as this savage girl.
She had been alone for a week now,
while the herders were off on the
range, rounding up the horses for their
yearly branding. To-night she looked
for them home. There was a sound of
bacon sizzling in the big frying-pan.
The brown-jacketed potatoes peeped
from their biding place in the hot
ashes, and Carmen left the door for"a
moment to peep into the oven at
the biscuit coloring delicately in
side. Carmen cooked well, and
the boys found her presen6e a welcome
one, freeing them of irksome stewing
over the stove when they rode home
tired and hungry.
She glanced through the window as
she rose from her biscuit inspectiob,
then hastily returned to her post in the
doorway.
Far off on the edge of the prairie a
tiny moving cloud made its appearance,
creeping snail-like toward her; grad
ually it rolled and swelled and came
rushing over the intervening plain,
taking shape into rounded puffs ever
falling and renewing.
"Lacaballadal" she murmured, in a
satisfied tone.
At last there came a thunder of
quick hoof-beats, and then the excited
herd dashed after their leader into the
big corral. The'heavy gates banged.
the chain rattled over the staple. Five
hungry men sprang from their saddles,
and. hastily picketing their ponies,
made a bee-line for the cook house'
Theygreeted Carmen with boisterous
jollity, flung taemselves upon their
benches, and without further ado be
gan to devour the food set before them.
"Lley! this coffee is prime, my Car
men!" "Some white woman taught
yer ter make biscuits, gal!" "Say, Jake,
you bet it's fine to get back to Carmen's
cookin'!" vociferated one and another,
as, the edge of their appetites-dulled,
they began to ply their knives more
slowly.
Carmen paid no attention to their
rough compliments. She was standing
behind her husband's chair, acting as
waitress when. occasion required, at
other timies fingering in sombrero or
timidly touching his touseled curls.
Each man was duly supplied with edi
bles, but the crispest bacon and brown
est biscuit found their way to Jake
Ringer's plate, until finally he looked
up and announced: "I've had enough!
Now eat, yourself."
The men rose from the table and
scattered to their evening occupations.
Only Jake remained. smoking in the
doorway, while Carmen sat down to
her meal of fragments.
As the last slouching figure vanished
toward the cabins be turned to the
woman with a slow smile and asked, in
Mexican: "has it been lonely these
days, ears mia f"
"It is alwvays night in my heart when
thou art gone, O, my husband!"
Then,in the soft Mexican tongue,they
talked together of such things as made
up their life-of the range happenings,
of the morrow's work, of what they
would buy in Almito when the herds
were driven in to be sold.
Lastly, as Jake rose and knocked the
ashes from his pipe, he remarked in
English:
"To-morrow and Friday's the brand
in,' but Saturday I'll make the boys get
out the plow en fix us a fire-break.
The grass is uncommon long jest
now, en it's dryin' fast. Ef we don't'
look out, we'll have the whole camp
goin' up in smoke."
He strode through the starlit dusk
toward his sleeping shack, and Carmen,
shutting softly the door of the cook
house, followed slowly in the same di
rection.
The air felt stifling and oppressive.
A stiff breeze came out of the south,
but its hot breath filled the frame
with uncomfortable languor. Old Tom
Griffin, standing in the door of the
boys' shack, hallooed to Jake as he
passed him. Carmen slipped by them
and into her own little shanty.
"Looky here, Jake," growled old
Tom, in an undertone, "the boys is
snoozin' a'ready, but I can't turn in
for thinkin' er that pesky long hoss
feed outyander. With thishere breeze
a fire cud come a-gallopin'-what
d'yersay ter you'n me goin' out now
and burnin' off a bit? Jest for luekl"
"Pshaw, Tom, 'tain't so awful dry
yet, neither. Turn in, man, en quit
botherin'. After the brandin's done,
we'll up and plow a good breakin'.
You bet I'm tired, en I ain't no mind
ter go burnin'-off this time o' night."
He turned on his heel and disap
peared into the smaller cabin. Old
Tom shook his head. "Them boys
ain't keerful enough," he muttered;
"seems to me them critters yander air
oneasy." He glanced once more
toward the corral, where an unusual
stamping and pawig seemed to con
firunhis words; one more he shook hi
besa d4oubttU;y them. efter look U
round the horizon, where no unneom
mon sign was manifest, he at last
sought his bunk. Tired nature soon
drowned his fears in sleep.
Five hours later a slim, red tongne
reached over tho crest of the knoll
that bounded the horizon of -Star
camp to- the south. It writhed this 1
way and that among the long grass
stems. Another and another followed
it, then a wall of flame, reaching east
and west as far as the eye could fol
low, rose over the ridge and bore down,
with race-horse speed, upon the de
voted little settlement below.
Jake Ringer stirred uneasily in his
sleep, and flung a proteeting arm over
the quiet figure beside him. A glare of
lurid light filled the little room with
the brightness of noonday; but still |
they slept on. Outside in the corral
horses were' snorting and stamping.
their wild.eyes staring at the distant,
but swift-coming danger. The ani
mals picketed on the prarie tugged at
their stout ropes, rearing and scream
ing.
Old Tom Griffin, waked by the rising
clamor, sprang with a bound to the
door. "Fire! Fire!" he shouted.
"Quick, out of this, or ye'll smother
like rats in a hole!"
Four half-clad figures rushed out in
to the night, and Dick Elland beat on
Jake Ringer's door, calling: "Up! Up!
if ye value yer lives!"
Roused from his heavy slumber Jake 1
stumbled across the floor; trembling, 1
Carmen followed close behind.
One look at the oncoming demon
brought Jake to his wandering senses.
"A back-fire, quick, you idiots!" he
bawled, and made a break for the
cook-house.
Old Tom laid a powerful, restraining
hand on his shoulder.
"Too late, my lad!" he shouted above
the din of the frantic, penned-in herd. t
"That furnace 'ud reach us afore 'twas
even started."
Indeed, the fiery breath of the ad
vancing flames already scorched their
faces.
"We must trust to our good horse
flesh!" spoke up Dick Elland, quickly.
A rush for the picketed ponies-in
an instant more each man was riding 1
for his life.
Jack Ringer was first in the saddle;
he curbed his frightened steed with
one strong arm, and with the other 1
swung Carmen's light form to a seat 1
behind him.
It was old Tom who stopped at the
corral, snatched the chain from its
hook, and, flinging wide the gates,
gave freedom to the poor, erazed crea
tures within the walls.
Fear lent wings to their feet-the
ridden and the riderless together
dashed eagerly toward the dark north
ern horizon, where, miles away, lay
safety in the cool waters of the Brazes.
No one looked bac.. in time to see how,
with a leap and a roar, the hungry
flames pounced on the deserted build
ings, and, in one short moment, licked
up every trace of man's handiwork.
On and on, mile after mile of dry
prairie slipping back from their swift
beating hoofs, sped the fleeing band.
Anxious faces turned now and then
to see if they kept their start
frbm their evil pursuer. It was
Carmen, cowering on old General's
broad back-Carmen, clinging with
a clutch of despair to Jake's shoul
ders-who turned the oftenest. It
was Carmen who first noticed the short
distance-so terribly, hopelessly short
-between them and the eddying flame
cloud was lessening. She shrieked
aloud in her terror, but Jake bade her
sternly: "Take courage! It's only two
miles more to the river!"
Only two miles!-but the pace was
telling. The work-tgeary and laden
ponies were already distanced by the
flying herd. Old General, with his
double burden, still kept his place in
the van, but Jake could feel he was
weakening.
Nearer and ever nearer swept the de
stroying element. Slower and slower
seemed to move the panting and strain
ing horses.
A mile-a half-mile-now but a quar
ter-to safetyl Could they make it?
The fire was pressing them closely; the
stinging smoke blinded men and
horses; their skins parched and cracked
in the awful heat. Inch by inch Old
General lost his frontage; in vain Jake
plied the spur, in vain he swore and he
pleaded; the good old horse was spent!
In one last, despairing glance ik
ward, Jake saw that the flames were
upon them; his brave beast still stag
gered forward, but at that pace noth
ing could save them. Carmen's face
was buried on his shoulder.
With parched lips the man muttered:
"At least we die together!" -
A wild scream ran through the pall
of grass smoke. Old Tom on the river
bank heard it: "'Ados,'care mmo, one
alone may be saved!"
The clinging arms relaxed; relieved
of the woman's weight, the horse
sprang forward.
For a second her figure stood haloed,
as her hair and light garments blazed
upward; then the swirling billows
shut out the terrible picture.
Jake Ringer covered his eyes and
fell forward on General's neck. He
4id not know that his hair was singed
and his clothes already smoldering as
his horse plunged into the Irazos. He
did not know that his comrades lifted
him gently up the opposite bank as the
fire swept to the water's edge and died
into sullen darkness. But when he
came back to consciousness, then he
knew that Carmen bad given her life
for him.--Sin Francisco Argonaut.
Guard Their TePnallr.
A New Yorker sitting on the edge of
a small Adirondack lake was attracted
by a school of tiny fish that seemed to
move in remarkable union. Watching
for a long time he discovered that the
infant fish were guarded by their par
eats, for whenever the young began to
stray they were driven back into the
school by a large fish on one side or
the other, and whenever a strange fish
approached one of the guardians rushed
at him and drove him off. The watcher
noted the movements of several auall
schools for two hours, and vows that
the little creatures were tea4ded 1G a
MENDING BOYS' ULOTHE' .
A Metbee W-ale Helpe la This Presmse
Work.
This is the time of year when moth
ers are wondering, which will "go
first," the boys' winter clothes or the
winter, and requites a skill born of ex
perience to manai without an expen
ditute which, reckoned by valve re
ceived, is extravagance.
It pays to mend and to mend neatly,
even in these days of cheap suits, and,
though it may seem a waste of time
and energy to patch and-darn garments
which cost but little, still the aggre
gate of these- mnall savings, especially
in a large family, forms an item of im
portance.
With trousers eternal vigilance saves
many stitches and many clothes. If
one can only forestall a break, a patch
may be put insideso that, it will hardly
show. With knickerbockers, which
ar apt to split like the sleeves of the
Jacket at the hem, it is easy to take a
neat seam if the ,break has not left
ragged edges. Careful pressing is re
quired for all cloth darning.
With jackets the points of wear are
the elbows, the edge of the sleeves, and
the front. The elbows may be mended
like the trousers, by slipping a piece
of cloth inside, between the lining and
the cloth, and darning neatly. The
edges may be turned in just farenough
to hold and then sewn together by
blind stitching. On dark cloth it is of
ten possible, - especially for the worn
place on the front, to buttonhole stitch
with coarse twist. Should any white
still show, it may be inked occasion
ally.
Nearly all laundries takes orders for
new bands for shirts, and the work is
done so reasonable that it is hardly
worth one's while to attempt it at
home. But sometimes only one but
tonhole of a shirt is broken. It is then
practicable to set a piece into the band
and make a new buttonhole without
taking off the entire strip. The only
caution necessary is that in cutting out
the worn part in front it must be taken
far enough back so that the joint will
not show at the opening of the collar.
The piece cut out should be ripped off
the bosom and the new muslin seamed
and turned over level with the band,
so that no stitching will show.
Few mothers know how much may
be done with tape. For the opening at
the back of a shirt, for the shoulder
straps of a little girl's guimpe, for a
placquet hole, tape is invaluable. For
a shirt, cut a piece not quite two inches
long and sew it -across the lower part
of the opening at the back. This re
lieves the strain of a sudden jerk, such
as all boys are apt to give.
"I despair of ever getting really fast
black darning cotton," says one wom
an, "so I have taken to using cashmere
mending wool for all hosiery. It does
not make so neat a darn, but it is
softer for the feet and it never loses
color." The same. authority declares
in favor of darning flannels and flan
nelette garmenta in preference to
patching them.
The comic papers are not far wrong
when they ridicule the average woman
for not knowing how to sew on but
tons. It is often the simplest things
of which we remain longest ignorant.
because no one thinks it worth his
while to tell us just how they should
be done.
For buttons which are sown through
and through, and on which there is
great strain, such as those on chil
dren's waists, No. 16, or at least not
finer than No. 20, cotton is needed.
Linen thread is not available, because
it requires a coarse needle, and that
will not pass readily through the but
ton. Double the cotton, place a pin
across the top of the button and sew
over it and through the holes, winding
the cotton around the button under
neath after each stitch. Thus you
make an artificial shank, and when the
pin is withdrawn there is enough
thread to prevent it snapping when
strained.
For coat buttons, whether lasting,
bone or ivory, the best thing to use is
coarse twist. If you can get tailor's
twist, so much the better. Linen
thread turns gray, and becomes brittle
after a short time. Twist is the best
for shoe buttons, and should always
be used double.-N. Y. Times.
Toilet Accessorles.
There are many things necessary
nowadays for the up-to-date toilet ta
ble. One of the requisites, which for
tunately can be procured without ex
pense or trouble is a jar of salt-com
mon table salt, and it is a panacea for
many ills. A little of it dissolved in
warm water is sure to remove the
slight inflammation from eyelids red
dened by a long drive in the wind. If
used as a gargle it will allay any slight
irritation in the throat; a little should
occasionally be put in the water in
which one's teeth are brushed as it
hardens the gums. Tincture of cam
phor or tincture of myrrh, dropped
into the water is an excellent
wash for the mouth and throat
when the breath is not sweet. When
the latter is used the proper propor
tions are ten drops of myrrh to a-glass
of water. Powdered alum is another
important adjunct; a little should be
thrown into the water in which you
bathe your hands before putting on
gloves for a crowded reception or ball,
when there might be a tendency to
perspire too freely. It is said that a
few drops of sulphuric acid in the bath
water is also a preventive of too free
perspiration of either hands or feet.
An equal mixture of lemon juice and
glycerine is another "aid to beauty,"
necessary to the toilet table-it whit
ens as well as softens the hands.-Bo
ton Globe.
Bresd Cooked In a Stovepipe.
Some cooks are making crusty breed
in sections of stovepipe. These uten
sils are cut in the required length at
the tinsmiths and the edges turned
over so the hands will not be injured.
The dough, made into a loaf somewhat
shorter than the pipe, is placed in it.
From this apparently crude affair
comes crusty bread of excellent quality,
if the cook knows her business.-Hard

IN THE ELECTRICAL WORLD.
-Great improvements are being
made in the electric launch.
-An automatic breaker alarm for
electric railway circuits has been in
vented.
-During 1894 there were 1,600 pat
ents in the United States for electrical
inventions.
-As a direct result of the patent de
cision of the supreme court, great im
provements, if not a complete revolu
tion in the art of electric communica
tion throughout the country may soon
be looked for, now that the. Bell Tele
phone monopoly has been brought to
an end, so far as basic patents are con
cerned. -
-Work has been begun at Somer
ville, N. J., on what will be a complete
trolley road between New York and
Philadelphia. The company intend to
cater to the needs of the farmers, and
is haiving built a number of combina
tion cars that will enable the farmers
to carry with them small quantities of
produce to market.
-Iron, through its use for electrical
purposes, seems to have developed a
new quality, magnetic fatigue. In
tests made of transformers lately in
London to ascertain the open circuit
loss, it has been found that the loss in
creased steadily for the first two hun
dred days until it reached a fairly con
stant value of forty per cent. more than
at starting.
-One of the fads of the new czar of
Russia is the study of electricity. He
is intensely interested in everything
pertaining to electrical science, and
reads eagerly descriptions of the latest
experiments and applications in that
line of endeavor. He is said to have
made several ingenious contrivances
himself in the simpler lines of electric
al manipulation.
-French storage battery cars will
seat fifty-two passengers, and, within
the city, run at a maximum speed of
seven and one-half miles an hour. Out
side of the city limits the speed can be
increased to about ten miles an hour,
and even on the heaviest grades does
not fall below about four miles an
hour. Each car is equipped with a
battery of 108 cells each, divided up in
to twelve boxes of nine cells each.
These are united into four groups, each
capable of suipplying a fifty-volt cur
rent. Two motors are on each car.
-The very interesting and valuable
experiments which Dr. A. Bleile, of
the Ohio State university, has been
making with regard to the effects of
electric shocks upon animal organism
have reached a stage where a working
theory can be predicated upon the re
sults obtained. This theory is a com
plete departure from that most com
monly accepted. It has been supposed
that the cause of death in cases of elec
trocution was the breaking down of
the tissues. But the elaborate experi
ments which Prof. Illeile has made
leave no doubt in his mind that death
results from a very different cause.
He has found by experimenting with a
large number of dogs that an electric
slopck of sufficient intensity to cause
death results in a contraction of the
arteries so that they refuse to perform
their functions. This throws the blood
from the veins upon the heart and vir
tually drowns-the operation of that or
gan.-Cleveland Leader.

A YANKEE'S PLAINT.
Wha weebb Doseln Thianks or Cetter
Roads in spriag.
The most enthusiastic lover of cona
try life certainly has his enthusiasm
put to a severe test on the annual oc
currence of that annual horror, "spring
mud"-mud in this case always apply
ing to that article as located in the
public highway, and stirred to its aw
ful depth by every passing hoof and
wheel I do not think that "mud
time" in New England is materially
worse than the same period in other
localities; in fact, I think it preferable
to the same reign of terror in some
other places, for we really can touch
bottom at some depth here in New Eng
land, which does not appear to be the
case in all parts of the country when 1
the frost is coming out of- the ground.
In support of this, I recall the story
that has been told of the traveler along
STUCK IN THE MUD.
a New England road, where the spring
zephyrs had been playing havoc with
the "footing." The traveler was pick
ing his way cautiously along when he 1
spied a bat lying in the middle of the
road, and involuntarily he stooped and
picked it up, and, lo! under it was the
top of a man's head just protruding
from the surface of the mire. The
story states that the traveler was much
astonished, which proves to my mind
that he must have been a stranger in
these parts. But whether a stranger
or no, he was a polite man. He at
oned begged the other man's pardon
for thus unceremoniously taking off I
his hat, and concluded his apology by
asking itf he couldn't be of some assist
ance. "Oh, no, indeed," replied the
other, cheerfully. "I'm all right. I've
got a good horse under meel"
I hope we are on the eve or the morn
ing of a new day in the matter of coun
try roads. Everywhere the "good
roads" agitation appears to be spread
ing and makhig friends; but unless we
can have state supervision and aid in
making and maintaining country high
ways I fear that the great body of these
roads will still be subject to liquidation
at the annual occurrence of spring
weather, and, for that matter, after
every summer shower. It is a matter
of great difficulty to get a town to go
into any radical scheme of road im
provement, because of the cost involved.
The only chance, so far as I can see,
for the friends of road improvement to
effect any radical betterment in the
highways of their own vicinity is by
securing a more-intelligent direction
of the labor that is now expended upon
them.
Mott of our country roads are now
wretchedly handled as regards annual
repairs-not altogether because of lack
of means to make proper repairs,
though there is rarely s.fficient money
appropriated by the towns to keep the
highways in best shape, but because
those in chairge of road repairs have no
proper, conception of the way repairs
should be made." No private individual
would conduct his business as our
towns manage this matter of the high
ways. What would be thought of the
farmer who would call in a bank clerk,
put a thousand dollars into his hand
and tell him to go ahead and build a
barn for the farm? He would be con
sidered crazy. And yet the towns put
money or its equivalent into the hands
of men who haven't: the first idea as to
roadmaking, and tell them to go ahead
and repair the highways! The result
is apparent to everyone who rides five
miles through the country. It is an
unbusinesslike and wretched system.
The remedy? Well, there are a num
ber of remedies; but until we can
have state construction and state super
vision of highways (which ought then
to insure intelligent work), the only
thing that can be done, so far as I can
see, is to keep up the agitation for
better roads, and at the same time try
to get more intelligence into present
methods. What is needed is simple and
concise directions as to the best man
ner of preparing roads under present
conditions, and the bringing of this
instruction home to the men who need
it. It is useless to talk to the average
country town of Telford construction,
or any other construction which in
volves a much greater outlay than that
which is represented by present ex
penditures. The practical thing now
is to secure a wise use of the road
funds, that are being wasted because
of incompetence.
How shall this-be brought about? I
would sugtest that through the farm
ers' institutes, gange lectures and
farmers' club meetings the matter can
be brought directly to the farmers and
other country people who have to do
with the road repairing. Let us have
expert lecturers (men who will not talk
over the heads of their hearers) on this
subject, as we have expert lecturers on
dairy and other topics, and let them
carefully and patiently explain to.their
hearers just how they can best use the
materials at hand. Let our Sagricul
tural colleges have a course of lectures
on this subject in their short winter
courses that are now attended by many
progressive young farmers. Get a
little of the leaven of good sense in
road repairing into each one of the
towns, and it will spread. Rock
ballasted roads are all right and very
desirable; but until we get them
let us stop wasting road money,
and get the best results possible with
the present expenditure. Such results
would be far and away ahead of any
thing that the average country town
has now to show for the ~oney it an

sweet cream to be effectually churned
requires a temperature of from 50 to 55
degrees and one to one and a half

milk usually takes a longer time to

WATERING TROUGH.
Make One If ron Want Toer Stock ts
Hlav. Clean Water.
A watering trough simple in con
struction, that will not freeze or clog
with mud and can be made-by a boy, is.
shown below. By enlarging an ordl-.E
nary spring and using a half-barrel for
ovtrFLow
a trough, it will supply all the stock
on the farm with water. The top of
the tub must 'be nearly as high as the
top of the spring. The water runs into
the tub from the spring as fast as it is
taken out. The tub may be set in a
dry spot as far from the spring as is
desired, but it must be on a level with
the spring. The most satisfactory
plan is to set the tub partly in the
ground and bank it up well around the
tub and over the pipe conducting water!
from the spring. The spring should be
covered to preserve warmth in winter
and for coolness during summer.--T.

PackIln Butter for ome Urs.
Our way of packing butter for our own
use, says a writer in the Dairy WVorld,
is to have a perfectly clean jar, if pos
sible a new one. Then we nse salt and
granulated sugar, half and half, to put
between the layers, which we make
sbout three inches, thick, to make nice
pieces when cuntting for use. In mak
ing butter we use a -barrel churn and
make granulated butter. Wash it-ian
the churn until the "water runsa
clear; salt it to taste (which with .Iis
not very salt); drain it and take iU. -
into the butter bowl and let ilteafi
over night. Then work it just enos
to make the granules stick toethei
and then pack. Do not -ll-:t- th
quite full. Put a white bloth -bab
of that. Cover well and keelp in
clean place. If every stage of pe~M. -
ore from the cow to the jar hashla
clean and sweet, the butter 6 a
keep a reasonable time. -
