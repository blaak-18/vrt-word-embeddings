during those many years; the human
race (including John Chinaman) will
be exalted to a higher plane of ex
istence. The kingdom of Christ then
to be established on this earth, and
“Nations shall be born in a day’’ (to
Him); “His knowledge shall cover
the earth.” “The kingdom of earth
(all) shall be given to Him for His
possession.” All peoples will rally in
the missionary call of the gospel,
and the resurrected billions will, dur
ing this reign of righteousness, flock
home to their Creator God and His
Christ, as “the swallows fly home to
their nests.” But, alas, the wicked
and unbelieving will be destroyed in
the second death; from which there
is no resurrection.

THE NEGRO SECRET SOCIETIES
DID IT.
Dear Mr. Watson:—l am a reader
of your Jeffersonian paper, and am
well pleased with the piece I find
in the last issue on the negro ques
tion. There is nobody to blame for
the way the negroes act but the white
people, and I do say that I long
to see them forced to go to work,
with their wages cut down to where
they will have to work every day or
starve.
I am a section foreman for the
A. C. L. Railroad, and it is nearly-im
possible for me to get men to work.
Hundreds of negroes are walking up
and down the road daily, and you
can’t hire one to work. Why? Be
cause he has got a woman in some
man’s kitchen, and she is feeding
him, while he walks about and meets
paydays and calls himself a gambler.
You can’t hire him for any price!
Oh, I long to see the time when I
can work negroes as I once worked
them. I have worked them for fifty
six cents per day, and their board,
and I only allowed them nine cents
for their board. I long to see that
time again. For a while we had all
the hands we wanted, and they would
beg for jobs, but now you have to
beg them to work for you, and they
will hardly want to do it then.
Hoping you may have success in
all your undertakings, I am,
Very respectfully,
J. S.

answer to that Mississippi man on
the negro question.)
Ed. Comment: This is one of the
results of the work of the negro se
cret societies. They have made it
possible for black women to impose
such conditions upon the white wom
en, that the black woman can “keep”
at least one man all the time.

HE IS ON TO THE SOCIALISTS, ALL
RIGHT.
Socialists say many curious things.
Maple says that the Socialists stand
for all that the Populists do, and
more; when, in fact, the Socialists
do not advocate money reform at all
—never have had a money plank in
their platform. If the money trust
was broken, other evils would be ea
sily managed. Populists, advocate
money reform; Socialists do not.
The Socialists said that they wanted
every man to have all that he cre
ated; Watson showed the inconsisten
cy of such an idea.
Now, that little Socialist sheet pub
lished at Abilene, Texas, says that if
a man makes five bales of coton, that
it will be his, that he can sell it for
money or its equivalent. That does
not sound very socialistic. It seems
to me that that is just what we are
doing now. Os course, we would get
a better price for the cotton if the
monetary system was properly ad
justed. But Socialists do not advo
cate money reform. Some Socialists
say, “Have all things in common, like
unto the co-operative commonwealth
at Ruskin, Tenn.” Others say, that
a man can own the cotton he pro
duces to sell for money, etc.—which
is not Socialism at all. Neither is
that idea in harmony with the nation
al platform. In the cities they say
one thing, in the country a different
thing. In their platform they advo
cate one doctrine in their papers and
speeches they advocate a different
doctrine. How shall we judge them?

Ed. Comment: Yes; Socialists
don’t dare talk about the money ques
tion. They know that most of the
ills which afflict us flow from the
money trust—an insufficient volume
of government-made currency.
The Ruskin experiment was a mis
erable failure, as every one of the
numerous experiments of the kind
have been. t g yy
THE ALABAMA SITUATION.
Dear Sir:—l wrote you several
days ago asking that you recon
sider your former letter to me, and
see if you couldn’t give us a date for
a speech in Dothan during the next
lew days. Haven’t heard from you
yet. I truly hope you may be able to
see your way clear to do this.
Every sore-toed politician in the
State, all the whisky men, all the
men who sell and buy it, are against
the amendment. The men who want
prohibition to continue want the
amendment. We don’t admit, I
don’t, that the election at this time
is timely. There may be political
axes to grind behind all this. It may
be that our prohibition laws were
secure, but this is the question:
The bulldog is out; he’s coming our
way. When the election was called,
every whisky man saw an opportuni
ty to make a rush for liquor. Money
is coming into the State from the
brewers and distillers; and this force,
together with the old home guard,
makes a dirty fight. They switch
everything into the campaign to
prejudice the minds of- the voter.
They hold up the horrible searching
of the homes; they even tell some
that they will never have another op
portunity to vote or serve on the
jury. There are so many people who
do not keep posted, and who will
not inform themselves, till it is a
nard fight.
Then, above all, two of the lead
ing criminal lawyers of this section,
men who have been political leaders,
are against it, and we all know that
they have been paid anywhere from
$5,000 on up for their fight. That’s
why they are where they are.
You know the common people as
well as you do the “uncommon.”
You are close to the hearts of the
people. There are hundreds of voters
all over this county who would
change their minds at once, no mat
ter how firmly they are fixed, if they
"Seffersonlan
heard you stand up for the constitu
tional amendment. I know it, and
every other man who keeps posted
knows it.
One good old farmer, who has vot
ed the Populist ticket every since he
had a chance, drove sixteen miles to
Dothan, and came to my office to find
out how you stood. He had heard
that you were of the opinion that the
amendment was a bad thing. Then
heard of your editorial where you en
dorsed it. He told me frankly that
he was perfectly willing to follow
you. I showed him your letter and
gave him some data, and he went
back to call a meeting and go to
work. They are all over the coun
try, men just like this good old
man. He is conscientious, and wants
to do the right thing. He was against
whisky. Seventy-five per cent, of our
voters are against it, but so many
other things have been tied on to
this issue that they don’t know
“where they are at.”
I hope that you will name a price
that you can afford to come at, and
come early. We will give you the
biggest crowd that has ever assem
bled in Dothan to hear a speech.
Yours truly,
W. T. HALL.
Dothan, Ala., Oct. 25, 1909.
WHY MR. WATSON DID NOT GIVE.
Dear Mr. Watson: —We have been
reading your publications since the
first numbers were printed, and have
been, all along, hearty believers in
your politics. But when you pub
lished your first article on Foreign
Missions our faith staggered for a
while, but after reading and study
ing carefully what you had said along
this line, we became convinced that
you were right here, too.
We have read, with enthusiasm,
all your articles on missions, and are
glad—yes, thankful—that you have
opened our eyes; for nothing short
of blindness could have prevented our
knowing, long ago, that our present
method of conducting Foreign Mis
sion work is wrong. And, although
we do not interpret your articles to
mean that you are a non-believer in
Foreign Missions, yet there are those
who do so interpret them, and it
hurts us, who are your loyal friends,
to hear you misrepresented.
Not long since we heard a man
who is a very earnest Christian,
class you with the hypocrite, giving
as his reason for so doing, the fol
lowing: The secretary of our Bap
tist Home Mission Board, after read
ing your plea for the people of the
mountain section, also your article
showing the great need of trying to
cope with the Catholic situation in
this country, wrote and asked you for
a contribution to help carry on their
work, which you so strongly advo
cated. But instead of sending money
to help along the cause in which you
professed to be such a strong believer,
you wrote the secretary that you
were sorry, but you had so many
calls you could not help him.
We do not, in the least, doubt
your sincerity, but to remove the
doubt from the minds of others, we
would like very much for you to give
in an early issue of the weekly Jef
fersonian your reason for not send
ing a contribution to this secretary.
We believe you had a good reason
for not sending him anything; and
we believe, also, that you help to
support home missions; but you and
every other Christian has a right to
give when and where his conscience
dictates.
Hoping that *you wfill prove to
those doubters that you are sincere
in what you say, and wishing you
Godspeed in your noble work, we are,
TWO LOYAL WATSONIANS.

Answer.
It is exceedingly distasteful to me
to discuss, in public, my own private
affairs. Were not my friends some
times embarrassed by criticisms of
me, I would simply take the position
that my charity work is nobody’s
business but mine; and I would de
cline to admit, by defending myself,
that any other human being has the
slightest right to dictate to me on
the subject.
Nothing is easier than to tell some
one else what he ought to do. In
fact, the Englishman’s idea of charity
has become thoroughly Americanized;
when Jones sees that Brown needs
help, he is bitterly aggrieved if Smith
doesn’t rush to the aid of Brown.
Charity-brokerage is a profession,
lucrative and arrogant. “Boards” and
things tell you what the Lord wants,
and how much of your money He
needs; and if you don’t hand it over,
down comes the anathema of the
brokers.
It seems rather harsh in that good
brother to call me a hypocrite on no
stronger evidence than my failure to
respond to the appeal of that Atlan
ta Home Mission Board.
If I were to give away money every
time 1 am asked for it, bankruptcy
would soon overtake me. The aver
age citizen can form no conception
of the number of letters, and individ
uals, that come to me asking for
help. To aid every one who seeks
financial assistance of me, would re
quire the income of a millionaire.
To tell you the truth, I do not give
my donations through any of these
expensive, unscriptural “Boards.”
The Bible nowhere indicates that
mission work was to be bossed by
such high-salary organizations as
now have control of the “Go ye” busi
ness. Secretaries here and secreta
ries yonder, with rake-offs of $2,500
per annum, are not in the Bible, so
far as I can see.
There was another thing about this
Atlanta Board appeal to me; it look
ed a little like a hold-up, or a trap.
I had come out strong in favor of
Home Missions, and against Foreign
Missions. The Atlanta Board, almost
immediately, called on me for money.
Now that looked suspicious. It
seembd to me that some of the Board
fellows had laid their heads together,
and concocted a clever scheme. I
thought I could hear them saying to
one another: “If we don’t discredit
that man in some way, he is going to
hurt the cause. Our revenues will
shrink. We may have to give up
these cosy quarters and fat salaries,
and go to work for a living. Let us
apply to Watson for money for Home
Missions. True, we have never done
so before, and he may ‘suspicion*
something; but, nevertheless, we will
now do it. If he 'comes across,’ we
put his ducats in our pockets; if he
refuses, we will expose him, and
have him denounced as a hypocrite.”
And that’s just what they did!
When my secretary was instructed to
