loved citizens and statesmen, Jeffer
son Davis and Abraham Lincoln.
The result was that the banner of the
stars and bars of our beloved South
land went down in defeat, while the
stars and stripes of our forefathers
floated out in victory, and resulted
in the abolition of chattie slavery,
(which was the bone of contention)
which allwise God had decreed must
be the result of an appeal to the
sword.
3rd—We now come to speak of the
emergency of the present hour, and
in the language oLholy writ, I ask—
“ Watchman, what of the night? Be
hold the day breaketh.” I feel as
sured that the crisis is upon us, and
that the emergency will be success
fully met, if all true reformers will
rally around our standard, under the
leadership of our true and tried
Thos. E. Watson, who has back of
him many co-workers who are just
as devoted to the work of reform as
he is.
It is the earnest prayer of the hum
ble writer that a just God may crown
their labors with success, and future
generations will rise up and call
them blessed.

ENCOURAGEMENT FROM AN OLD
FRIEND.
Dear Mr. Watson:—l have written
to you before this, years ago, but
I am truly sorry that I have given
you so little encouragement.
I believe you have written a grand
er epitaph for yourself than the one
you wish written on your tombstone,
for with your magnetic words and
your inspired pen you have written
Government Reform on the hearts
of men and that will outlive any
thing you may have carved upon your
tombstone.
The principles for which you stand
and defend will be the bright and
guiding star of civilization in genera
tons to come.
**' * * *
Now to the Jeffersonians: Breth
ren, let us rally around our leader
and show him our appreciation while
he lives and not wait until he is
dead.
Accept my best wishes, Mr. Wat
son, and may you live long to fight
the cause of the Common People.
Your true follower,
A. G. BRASWELL.

FOREIGN MISSIONS.
Dear Sir:—l have read your last
article in the June number of the
Jeffersonian on Foreign Missions and
am very much pleased with it. Your
ideas are just what mine have always
been, but you give me an immense
amount of information on this sub
ject. Very truly yours,
WM. M. PEYTON.

WHY DON’T PREACHERS AT
TACK MISSION STATISTICS
INSTEAD OF MR.
WATSON?
Dear Sir: —Enclosed find two dol
lars, for which please extend my
subscription to June, 1910, for both
the weekly and monthly Jefferson
ians.
You have certainly waked the peo
ple up on the Foreign Mission ques
tion; it is amusing to see the antics
of the preachers in their efforts to
prove Mr. Watson a liar. It is fine
sport to see them flounder and fume.
But, more than anything do we en
joy the prompt, polite and conserva
tive manner in which Mr. Watson
disposes of each assailant. That lit
tle fellow, Norton is to be pitied
rather than blamed. If I were in his
place I would apply to the Legisla
ture and have my name changed, and
then move out West. But then I
remember that it takes all kinds of
people to fill up the world, and I
guess Norton fills his place as well
as the balance of us mortals. If Ju
das Iscariot had not betrayed Jesus,
Peter or John would have had to do
it. So I guess it is alright to have
Judas and Norton. But it is a pity,
a great calamity for you to spend so
much of your valuable time spank
ing babies like Norton, and other lit
tle poppinjay preachers who have had
the timerity to attack you on the
mission question. Why don’t those
assailants of yours attack the statis
tics that you set up, taken from
books written by preachers, both
Methodist and Baptist? Mr. Watson
has committed no crime in the eyes
of right-seeing and right-thinking
people, but, on the contrary, he has
only confirmed the opinion of thou
sands of people, that there was graft
connected ith the Foreign Mission
business.
Speaking for myself, I have this to
say, that for the past twenty years I
have believed that the people have
been imposed upon by the Foreign
Board, as they have been by the two
old political parties, and that the im
position is growing worse all the
time. And further, I believe that
Mr. Watson’s exposition of the man
ner and methods of the use to which
the millions of money is put is cor
rect.
I believe fully that the God of
Heaven is directing Mr Watson in
this work. The Great Giver of all
good things has always raised up men
when the necessity arose to lead the
people out of the wilderness of ig
norance and bondage, and history
repeats itself. Whom the gods
would destroy they first make mad.
Behold the spirit in which Brother
Norton, Brother Cofer and the bal
ance of the brethren have assailed
Mr. Watson. But Mr. Watson takes
the erring brethren across his lap
and gently spanks them and lays
them gently down as a loving parent
would a naughty boy.
Oh, it’s such a waste of ammuni
tion. Mr. Watson, hire you a small
boy with a popgun to keep the
preachers off you, while you write up
the facts in the case. The masses are
looking on in admiration and ap
proval. It takes time and patience to
correct abuses, especially the kind
under consideration. If the brethren
prove that Mr. Watson is in error,
Mr. Watson will correct the error.
Will the brethren be as fair? I hope
they will.

CONFERENCE OF DEBS, WRIGHT
AND OTHER LEADERS MIGHT
BRING OUT NEW PARTY.
Dear Sirs:—l have been thinking
for some time of writing the Jeffer
sonian, of which I am a subscriber.
My first vote cast was for Reuben F.
Cobb, of Alabama, for governor, on
the Populist ticket. I stayed with the
party until after the election in 1896,
"Ob* Jeffersonian
then I went wrong, and voted with
the Democrats, or for Bryan, for I
thought that he was the right man.
But I lost all hopes in him or the
Democratic party.
Now I want the leaders of all or
ganizations for the laboring class to
have a conference and agree on a
platform that can and will be accept
ed by all laboring classes. The Third
Party platform may have something
that the majority can’t endorse; if
so, cut it if it isn’t a vital point. I
believe Mr. E. V. Debbs is a good,
conscientious man, and wants to do
something for the laboring class to
which he belongs, and a conference
with you and him and other leaders
will mean a great deal, create a new
party with a new name, with old
principles. I like the name of “Jef
fersonian.”
The All Wise Ruler will guide us
in the right.
Respectfully,
J. M. WILLIFORD.

FOREIGN MISSION EDITORIALS
WILL HAVE A “SANIFYING
INFLUENCE.”
Dear Sir:—Your article in the
April Jeffersonian Magazine on For
eign Missions has just been read by
me. It was mentioned by my friend
Dr. E. L. Morris, the Secretary of
the Home Mission Commission of the
General Assembly in the United
States, located in Atlanta.
Dr. Morris sent me his copy and I
am to return it to him. Could you
not have a copy sent to my address?
I would be greatly obliged.
I have taken the liberty of sending
you some literature on Foreign Mis
sions of the denomination to which
I belong, under the impression that
you will take some interest in it.
Your article is powerful. It must
have a sanifying influence. The Lay
men’s movement has for its slo
gan simply: Foreign Missions. No
discrimination whatever as to the
kind of missions.
Very respectfully,
S. S. LAWS.

A fine old preacher died in Ken
tucky the other day—a preacher of
an extinct type. For fifty years he
had been the pastor of the same
church. In season and out he was
always in his pulpit. He christened
the babies, married the young lovers,
prayed with the sick and buried the
dead; and never during the long
service did he charge a fee or receive
a cent of salary. He tilled a small
farm with his own hands, and thus
made a living for himself and fam
ily, and gave his services to God for
the glory of His cause without mon
ey and without price.—Greensboro

Tobacco Kills
FACE TO FACE WITH DEATH.
There’s nothing that can be said in
favor of the tobacco habit. It’s expen
sive; filthy; injurious to health—posi
tively dangerous. Nicotine is a deadly
poison witness the thousands of
deaths from tobacco heart, tobacco
cancer, from diseases of stomach, liv
er, kidneys that had their start in to
bacco poison.
“Easy-To-Quit” is a positive, abso
lute “stopper” for any tobacco habit.
It is a vegetable remedy and any lady
can give it secretly in food or drink.
It is harmless; leaves no reaction or
bad effects, and it stops the habit to
stav stopped.
Mothers, save the young smoker’s
brain, he cannot do it himself. Wives,
sisters and sweethearts, help save the
mind, body and future of some one
who is near and dear to you. Without
your help it may not be done.
