Herald at once, but had no opportno

month later, when young Bennett,
who was then freshly in Hudson's
place as managing editor of the Her.
01(1, ordered heinm to Mexico. By the
inHluenne of James B. Steedman, of
t)h ice, Clarke was engaged as private
secretary by Lewis Campbell, who
eva then on his way to Mexico as
minister. Campbell was to pay noth

Herald. Clarke thus got aboard of
die manof war which was to take
Campbell and General W. T. qher

tottering throne of the Emperor Max
iiuilian. On the voyage Campbell
confided to Sherman that he had a
lietald conrespoudent on board as
his private secretary, Sherman, with
his great aversion to correspondents,
pot Clarke ashore at Havana.
Clarke at once took steamer to
Vera Cruz, and reached there several
days ahead of Sherman and Campbell.
While waiting their .arrival Clarke
took strolls about the conotry round
Vera Cruz, and in one of these fell in
with a gentleman who was, as was
Clarke also, a fine French echolar.

The Israelitish religious New Year
was ushered in Friiday evening last,
and this ftestival, as well I tse At nle
iment, following ten dafiys laiter, are
observed mlore generally thalln any

In reality these festive d;ivs are the
fembodiment of the cardinal and fun

religion, the representative form of
tlie granlder anid snbhlimlity of the

On Rush IlashInna the Israelite is

tion, to make search into his past and
give account of his life, his omissions
and colmmissions, to his conscience,
and his Creator. Allnnually the cornet
sounds ieverberate in the Jewish halls
of worship to awaken the dormant
coniscience, the sligish mortal, the
let hargic agent, that the time will come
when sooner or later, he will have to
render that account-an event which
mlay drIop ldown upon hinit at any 0mo
lment, in the midst of tuddy health,
of robutst youth, while on the eager
limnt of worltlly possessions. The
corlnet (shofar) speaks: ''Man, you
are nothinig but a being of ephemeral
existeoce ; you carry your life in your
iiihandl, and when it comes to an end,
1i hat remanins of that around which
all your toils and labor, your care
andll anlxiety, centred f Nothing but
d ist. Can you then, believe, that
thalt is all tfor which this ivast averse
was instituted, that your intelligence,
which reads the unalterable laws
that hold the world together, that
your heart with its undulating mo
tions, areI nought but the play of
chance, the result of a fitful develop
ment, and that eternity is nothing but
sound 3 Your mind may not deci
phler thie secret of the great lmystery,
but your soul call conceive it, and
this soul is eternal, is of that fabric
whliclh you see not, hear not, cannot
touch, but which iaanitifsts itself
every wlheret and is the outporing of
the spirit eternal, tin khose image
your soul was fashionel. Andt tlhis
spirit-life, this soul lite, does not end
with the close of man's earthly career;
it is God-born and cannot cease. And,
when called away from its dust invest
ed career, what will you meet, whomn
will you meet f" Rosh IHashana an
swers : "You meet ll existence ever
lasting, continuing and developing, a
loving father, who has appointed you
to life eternal, and will not the death
of tlhe sinner, but that lie return from
his evil ways and( live forever." Roslh
Hashana tells us "Retribution is
positive, the law of compensation
sure; we are *acconotable beings,
reaping the deserts of our actions and
are held responsible ; while at the
same time, without any mediator, we
can approach our Creator, the soul
can soar upward to its divine source,
and can cast off all impuoities and be
bathed again in thle glory of innocense
and virtue." That tte nortal life he
immortllized, is the sole aim, the
only intent of Roslh Ilashana.

A Valaable Receipt.
Ve consider the following receipt
of such value that we transfer it to
our columns from the Stockton (Cal.)
Herald:
"I herewith append a receipt which
has been used, to my knowledge, in
hundreds of cases. It will prevent
or cure thle small pox, though the pit
tings are filling. When Jenier dis
covered cow-pox in England, the
world of science hurled an avalanche
of fame upotn his head; but when
the most scientific sclool of medi
cine in the world-that of Paris
published this receipt as a panacea for
small-poxit passed unheaded. It is
as ulfailing as fate, and conquers in
every instance. It is harmless when
taken by a well person. It will also
cure scarlet fever. Here is the re
ceipt as I lhave used it, and cured
scarlet fever; here it is as I have
used it to cure sluall pox, when learn
ed physicians said the patient must
die: Sulphate of zioc, one grain;
h alf a teaspoonful of sugar; wixed
I with two tableepoonsful of water.
When thoroughly mixed, add four
ounces of water. Take a spoonful
every hour. Iither disease will dis
appear in twelve hours. For a child,
smaller doses, according to age. If
counties would compel their playsi
~ cians to use this there wonld be no
need of pest houses. If you value
advice and experience, use this for
that terrible disease.

be swearing loudly and awkwardly.
lie patronizes the drama, and is aud

in his criticisms. lie kniows where
an actress is paddulled, and just how
much. He is the terror of the super

appear. lie indulges in practical
jokes on the apple boys, and saturates
the dresses of the adjoining ladies

He regards tobacco, in all its forms,
a great developing agent of manhood.
lie takes kindly to strong drink, and
considers having been "as drunk as

You may gather any twenty of this

Time for Action.
[Burlington Hawkeye.]
Yesterday morning a tall mhan, with
fiery eyes and unsteady ways, stalked
into the office with the air of an in
jured man. Hle had a newspaper in
his hand, and hie started to walk
across the, roosi but changed his mind
and unliimbered and went into posi
tion in a chair on the nearest side of
the table.
"Goo' graciouns!"
And tihe young man at the table
said, "Good morning," and wanted to
know what was needed.
"'S awful," said the stranger, evi
dently laboring under great excite
ment, "'s juins' tawfnl. Why donnoby
do somethin'f Why don' May' HIa
dams call lout the nm'litia I Why
don't Gover nor Gear call for troops '"
The young muan said ie didn't know
why, but ihe presumed they would if
anybody wanted them to. And why
did ihe want so many troops and

Here the young man gently inter
rupted the visitor to tell him he was
laboring under a delusion; that there
wasn't and had never been a case of
yellow fever in the city, and that
there wasn't a case of it north of the
Ohio river.
The tall stranger stood up on his
feet and held on to the table.
"Then," he roared, and his ferocity
grew more uncontrollable while he
spoke, "then wha'-whatchmer go an'

The young man gently took the
crumpled paper from his hands, and
pointing to the first page, said softly
but firmly:
"But we didn't. This is not our
paper you have been reading. This is
time New Orleans Times, published in
New Orleans, Louisiana. We have
nothing to do with it, and it tells
only the truth about its own yellow
fever."
The tall visitor weakened a little,
and seemed undecided whether to sit
down or pull for the door. He fnally
pulled for the door.
"You must 'acuse me," he said,
apologetically, "but I'm moe' wore

And with a slightly foolish laugh
which ended in a threat, he went
down stairs to find the man that lied
to him about the Hawkeye.

RED RIVER NAVIGATION.

Registration.
[Shrevport Standard.]
That the people of New Orleans,
amid the surrounding gloom and dis
tress, will neglect in a great measure
the present political campaign is
very natural. Thousands of voters
have already fled from the plague
stricken city and will not return be
fore the election. Perhape thousands
of others will hardly take the trouble
to turn aside from their melancholy
duties of the afflicted to register in
time. This will, of course, work to
the injury of the Democratic ticket.
Thlie country expects the city to give
such an overwhlelming Democratic
majority as to overcome any possible
opposition majorities in the negro
Iparishes. The majority in New Or.
leans will necessarily fill off consid
erably. For, while the whites may
be absent in large numbers and those
that remain may be neglectful of the
duty of registration, those who are
manipulating the negro votes, most
of whom remain and a smaller pro
portion of whom are attacked with
fever, will be very apt, as in time
past, to see that this class take out
their registration papers and go to
the polls on election day. In fact,
we have reliable authority for stating
that already the colored registration
in New Orleans is nearly equal to that
of the whites, although the latter
largely ontuniumber the former in pop
ulation.
Such being the case it behooves
the Democrats of the country parishes
which have escaped the yellow fever
visitation, to give soieni atteiutou to
the matter of registration within the
time prescribed for it. No one can
vote, unless hlie has first been register
ed., Local central committees, and
ward committees, should take this
matter in hand and see that there is
a full registration and a full vote in
every parish. The success of the
ticket should not be endangered by
neglect of this important duty.
"Turned Round."
Lieut. Col. Dodge mentions in his book,
"The Plains of the Great West," several
illustrations of the curious sensation oc
casionally experienced by travelers. It
is the feeinug of being "turned round."
A inat going up the Hudson River on a
steamboat finds himself apparently going
ilown the river. A passenger looks out
of a car window and thinks the train is
moving backwards. The sensation is
oiten so intense that no power of mind
can change it. It generally goes off it
self after a littlh while.
When the fefling comes upon a man
on the plains, antd the best-knowu lo
calites look different from what they
ought to appear, then he knows what, in
the plains sense, is the senlation of "get
ting lost." Sometimes an old plainsman
arrives at a stream which he knows,
ought to run in a particular direction.
But it runs the other way. He knows
what this means. If he has no compass,
he goes into cattip at once, and quietly
waits until he gets all right, and the
stream runs in the proper direction.
Two gentlemen, well acquainted with
the plains, were once separated from a
hutintg-party. After wandering about
some time, they suspected they might be
lost. They compared compassee. Both
pointed in the same direction. But the
men were "turned round," and therefore
made up their minds that both compasses,
through some local attraction, were
wrong. A discussion and then a quarrel'
ensued as to the proper route. They
separated, each going his own way. Both
were wrong, and the compasses were
right. One got into camp by accident
the other had to be hunted np and
brought back.
When a man is "turned round" on the
plains, he generally wants to keep mov
ing. His nerves become unstrung, erdi
nary events possess unusual signifeance
and he soon loses all control of himself
If approached by parties searching for'
him, he sometimes runs off, strivilg to
escape them.

shows only ignorance of the falcts.

Unless the best Democrats of the

stronger by thousands. of votes t ha n

entire control of the State Govetrn

need not be permanent, while thern
are those in the Republican party,
not all of which were active at the

Physicians were sent from this city
a few days since, with nurses. Onet
of the physicians has just returned,
and his report of the condition of at'
fairs, - when generally known, will
greatly increase the sympathy felt
for the wretched people of the South
west. It is not possible to write
plainly of. the terrible condition in
which helpless women, children and
men are left. All self-restraint is
lost among a large class of those not
yet attacked with the fever, and there
is little plroteotiou for person or prlop
erty. And starvation is ii ouosisntuotan
of homes. Mr. Hayes, when heli re
turns to the Capitol, should not omh\
extend such aid to the people of the
Southwestern cities as be can do by

call the httention of all citizens to the
necessities of the case. Too much Uor
too ready relief cannot be given.
