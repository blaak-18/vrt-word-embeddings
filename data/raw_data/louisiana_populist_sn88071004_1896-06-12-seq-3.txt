of hMurphy tIe Little shall he

"Unless he have the seal Upen his

in his hand he shall be cut off from
ithe c ngregation of papsuckers."
The question now worrying the
r administration Democrats is how
i- to apparently answer the demand
re of the honest men in their rants
for a Constitutional Convention
that will give us a governmo-nt of
honesty, and at the same time leave
them with a loophole through which
they can steal all the offices they
want. They would be p.rfectly
willing for an unlimited convention
if they were not afraid that it
Swould limit their opportunities for
practicing their old trade of steal
ing everythihing in sight worth car
rying off.
II When I was a child living in one
of the Atlantic seaboard States,
I lived where there were great
numbers of negroes, and I remem
ber many of their old fears and
superstitions. The present condi
Stion of Louisiana brings very forci
bly one of the greatest fears that
. those people had. They had the
opportunity of learning the Chris
2- tian religion and were taught the
j general outline of the ten com
mandments. Of course they had
an idea at eavenandhell, and be
lIeved the one was give s as re
ward for an upright Christian life,
and a failure of faith and conver
ieon consigned one to the other.
But there was a third state for
Sthe poor cretoresa, and this gave
a them more neasiness than hell, as
they could more easily realize the
condition. My recollection is that
. these people taught their children
that if thy destroyed their parents,
Sstole property, maurdered or were
ivery irreliglous, they would be
a eat to hll when they died, but if
they would not work for their ras
trs, ran away, or were impudent

You'll Laugh
If You Read
This funny and instructive hook
tells in a most humorous way how
the Angel of Liberty took Grover
Cleveland from the White Iouse
in the dead of night, and left him,
ragged and hungry, in Oklahoma
City, to tramp home. Grover's
trial's and tribulations as a tramp
are most ludicrously related, and
his conversations with farmers
and laboring men about the silver
question are very instructive.
Everybody Should Read II.
It contains 176 paecs of laugh
provoking matter, and 40 full-pave
illustrations of Cleveland as a
tramp.
PRICE, 25 Cents.
