It is understood that the innovation i,
not on the 'T.wang Yankee lint on the
pronunciation and the articulation of
words, as defined iii the most approved,
unabridged dictionary. Against such an
htority it would he vain and hopeless
to remonstrate, but is it possible that
our predecessors, our great grand
fathers and mothers, cited now and then
as models of intellectual culture and
refinement, were guilty of such mani
fest ignorance, as would now be heaped
upon them indirectly, because, in the
plain, smooth, musical rythm of the
lnguage they would not have said:
"John. Harfter milching the Keows.

The Sttulanrd Oil Trust has raised
F the price of coal oil t cent. This will
amount to a tax of between $2;.ooo.ooo
and $j3o,ooo.ooo. What excuse is there
for such robbery as this at a time when
crude oil was never so plentiful as now?
--Commercial Appeal.
Excuse! Did not Mr. Rockefeller re
cently donate a million dollars to Dr.
Harper's university in, Chicago! When
he gives up another million will he not
at the same time make ready to skin the
dear, good people, the consumers, to
the tune of from sixteen to twenty-five
million more dollars? Mr. Rockefeller
has an eye on the dollars. while Old
Nick has an eye on him. There is some
compensation in the reflections of the
hereafter.
The Memphis Commercial Appeal
says: "A young man in Galveston
struggling under the weight of .iuch a
name as Hans Grafbichl von Schoffky
committed suicide. Can he be blamed ?"
