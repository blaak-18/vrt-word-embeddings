FARMER AND PLANTER.
TRUCK FARMING.
small Fariu Near ..c~as upy-Be mar a
ouaree of Wealth.
The small farms near eities and townts
may be'"made profitable by being de
voted, in a measure at least, to truck
farming. To attain to any marked
buocess in this line, however, requires
a'thoroughgess notae emsential in some
other bianchesof farm husbandry. The
question of selling the products of the
truck farm after they have been raised
often requires more study tIhan that of
growing them, There are generally
three ways by which these goods are
disposed of. The first is to sell the
goods direct at wholesale prices to the
green grocers, who make a business
of distributing them. The second
method is to build up a regular trade
by having a permanent market stand
where customers *1Will coti, the third
and last way is to have a regular route
to peddle the goods to whoever cares
to buy them. The latter method takes
so much time that it actually costs
more to sell the goods than to grow
them. Very few progressive truck
farmers can afford to leave their farms
long enough to peddle out all of their
produce in this way. They may often
get more for the goods, but the ques
tion is whether the additional sum will
pay for the extra time required:
The second method is superior to the
third, for a permanent stand in some
good city market means that good cus
tomers will in time come early to the
place and the goods can be disposed of
before noon. In this way the farmer
oan get back to his farm early in the
day ready for loedithg up again. Where
rent has to be paid for the stand, the
question of profit becomes more doubt
ful. The disadvantages of this system
are also numerous. In order to get to
the stand early one must rise very early
in the morning and spend many hours in
the air during all sorts of weather. In
the fall of the year there will be con
siderable exposure to the cold, so that
one actually runs the risk of injuring
his health. The wholesale method of
selling the market produce is employed
by the most of the progressive truck
farmers, and, on the whole, it seems
the most businesslike. The wholesale
manufacturers are willing to receive
less profit on their goods and to have
someboby else distribute them. In this
way they are relieved of details and
can devote all of their energies to their
one plant. The same reasons apply to
the market gardener.
He does not, as a rule, save by spend
ing of his time in peddling goods, but
some central, trustworthy distributing
point should be made so that he can re
lieve himself of all further care about
thegoods. VWholesale dealers will sup
ply the trade with only a fair profit to
them, and this profit is legiti
mately earned. The difference be
tween the prices for the goods at
wholesale and retail is sometimes very
large-almost too large to make farm
ers believe that everything is honest.
inut retail dealers have established
their trade, and their prices do not
fluctuate so much as those of the whole
sale markets. If any produce declines
in value it is several days after before
the retail markets show any signs of
it, and if the decline is only of short
duration, the retail prices will not
change at all. The consumers are the
one that lose on one side by this, and
the cultivators of the soil at the other
side. The middlemen make the extra
profit, and generally the small retail
stores get the lion's share, still, all
things considered, it pays most truck
gardeners better to deal with the
wholesale houses rather than to at
tempt to peddle their goods around, or
to make separate bargains with the
retail stores.--American Cultivator.
THE VETCH.
Its Value wa a Forage Plant to Southern
Farmers.
If it were not for the difficulty of
saving the seeds of vetch, it would hbe
one of the most popular of southgrn
forage plants.
It belongs to the legumes, and the
little pods that bear the seed pop open
as soon as they get a little dry, and
scatter the seed over the ground. On
account of the care involved in saving
seed, there is comparatively little seed
saved, and the price is such as to deter
most farmers from sowing it.
If a crop of vetch is allowed to seed
even once on a piece of land, a crop can
be made for a number of years in the
same manner that a cre p of burr clover
is renewed.
Vetch and burr clover are much alike
in habit, springing up in the autumn,
thriving in the winter, yielding fine
pastures or good mowing in the early
spring, making seed and dying down
completely before the hot weather of
June. The seeds hle in the ground,
with no disposition to sprout until the
fall rains occur.
Along in September or October, some
times as early as August, the seed
germinate after saturating rains, and
where the land is rich a good pasture
will result sometimes before Christmas.
Stock should not be .turned on to it
until it gets well established, and if
the full benefit would be derived from
it, never let stock run on it when
the ground is wet. Such a practice
will soon spoil a good pasture. The
reckless pasturing of soils through all
kinds of weather has much to do with
impoverishing them. Such a practice
should be followed no longer. One
should be particularly careful in, the
treatment of a winter pasture. The
southern stock-grower and dairyman
will find the vetch a very useful plant
sown along with those previously
commended for their quality and pek
manency. -
Like a few others, such as burr clover
and white clover, the -etch makes an
excellent "combination" plant. Like
peasa and eclvr, it is helpful to the

tiored in with a heavy, sharp tooth
harrow on Bermuda swaird in October,
it makes a very good pasture in the
early spring, and as soon as it dies
down in May or June, the Bermuda
will renew its growth more vigorously
than it would have done without the
vetch's influence for good. Mixed
crops make more per acre, and mixed
food is better for stock of all kinds;
I hate never seen weathert sevei'
enough to damage vetch in the wvihitei,
when it was sown early enough to
catch a good hold before the freezing
weather.
On good land rye and vetch together
give a very heavy crop for forage very
early in the season. These remarks
apply exclusively to the Wiiter Vetch.

Carbon bi-sulphide is the simplest.
cheapest and most efficient remedy in
such cases yet discovered. It is a colors

which, however, passes off completely
in a short time. It readily volatilizes,
and the vapor, which is very deadly to
insect life, is heavier than air and settles
and fills any compartment or bin in the
top of which the liquid is placed. It

the top of grains in bins, and the gas
will settle throughout the mass. In
large bins, to hasten and equalize the
operation, put a quantity of the bi-sul
phide in the center of the grain by
thrusting in balls of cotton or rage
tied to a stick and saturated with the
liquid, or by means of a gas pipe loose

liquid may be poured and the plug
then loosened with a rod. In moder

Grass loges.
About this time in the year we see
quotqtions in- the market reports of
"grass hogs," and it will be noticed
that the prices quoted for these are al
most al vays lower than those for regu
lar fed stock. This is because the flesh
of hogs fattened out on grass or slop is
not as firm as that of grain-fed animals,
and is not as valuable in the eyes of
packers or users. It does not pay to
send such stock to market one time in
ten, and this year, when the wheat
crop is large and the price is low, it is
an absolute waste of good material tc
sell grass-fed hogs. A hog that is well
fed and in good condition from grass
feeding may be made to put on weight
very rapidly if fed cracked wheat with
a little corn, and at present prices of
hogs there is no way in which a greater
price can be realized for wheat than to
feed it to them. A well-finished lot of
hogs which has been fed out on wheat
and corn will make the best of pork,
and in market will bring the top prices.

-Scrub horses are as cheap as dirt
that will not sprout peas, and for the
same reason-not wanted.
-There is a great advantage in fall

greater advantage in spring pigs, for

-Second crop pot:atoes for seed are

as well as in the south, and whe.ever
used they have proved to be better
than the mature tubers.
-D. J. Curry. of Mercer county, Ky.,
made more money off sixteen acres of
Irish potatoes this year than he did
from 100 acres of wheat. Southern
farmers will be better off when they
diversify their crops, and not confine
themselves to wheat, corn, tobacco and
cotton.
-Oleo made from the fat of horses
and mules is said to cost two to three
cents per pound less than that made
from the fat of swine and k'ne, and it
makes a more deceptive substitute for
butter, and one more difficult to detect
by the taste, smell or flavor.
-A stone of about one hundred
pounds weight placed near the center
of the cow lot will be found a great
convenience to those who have sense
enough to use it, and not sense enough
to restrain a desire to kick the cows.
Kicking the stone answers the purpose,
and does no harm.

THE REPUBLICAN RAISE.
it Wa she TarlW Instead of the Working
McKinley, the logical candidate of
the republican patty for the presi
dency, says that there are two ways of
checking importatione--Ote by impos
ing a ftll otr p.oliibiMte tariff and the
other by lowering .irg~s.
Then it ought td be found that is full
or prohibitive tariff increases Wages
both in the special lines of protected
!ndustf~g and generally throughout
the country. McKinley made a tariff
and the result was lowered wages in
the most fully protected lines and a
tendency downward in all wage-earn
ing occupations. How is this?
It ought also to be Instantaneously
apparent that-Wrages are first increased
in the particula" line where the pro
hibitive duty is levied and subse
quently increased from industry to in
dustry until everybody is getting good
wages. But instead of being so in
stantaneously apparent that the intel
ligent workingman can see the swell
of increase starting from the particu
lar point and lifting the level of the
whole country, it is never apparent at
all, and the workingman must take
McKinley's word for the blessings that
attend a prohibitive rate.
In 1892 the republican platform de
manded duties equal to the difference
in wages between the United States
and countries which might send goods
here.
Democrats at once promised that
they would not propose a tariff in this
congress which would not give duties
to that amount. Not that they agreed
to any connection between a tariff and
wages, but that they had no desire to
at once radically reduce duties to the
extent a literal comipliance With the
republican platform would require. To
fit a tariff to the republican platform
it would be necessary to figure out the
cost of each protected article. For in
stance, the tariff maker must find out
how 'much the manufacturers here
and abroad pay for the labor employed

would find out that the American
manufacturer pays less than the En

Spanish or Italian.
Hence, to reduce duties to meet the
republican platform's demand would
he to abolish them altogether. Ot
course, the republicans did not intend
to demand free trade, but to construe
their platform according to the known
facts of manufacturing production
would be to liberate trade, absolutely
and finally.
Iloth the republican platform of 1892
and the logical republican candidate
for 1896 have either lied to the Amern
can people or have exposed a singular
ignorance of facts. The second suppo
sition is a true one in McKinley's case.

did you only raise the tariff?"-St.

And how long will the country per

their labor to the lowest starva

when the general government will fol

levied upon the people and enforce the
application of those taxes for the pur

other words, if manufacturers will
not pay to labor the tariff taxes levied

A FEW COLD FACTS.
Unpalatable Evidenes for the Csamtalt

there is instrictiot Ian the record of
tailures for the last nine mtonths is
compared with .the eorresponding
period ini prefviOds ea's.
The whole number this yejr, bse6ord
ing to Bradstreet's record, was 9,21.
with actual assets to the amount of
$59,707;031 and liabilities to the
amount of s1i0,674,84d. Durting the
corresponding period last yeat the
number was 11,140. with assets of

109. It appears, therefore, that while
the number this year is still large, the
liabilities are not much more than
one-third as great as they were last
year.
The decrease this year is not re
markable, as the comparison is anadl
with the period 1Lst year which inti
eluded the panti months. A conipars
son with the same period of 1891,
when the country was in the high tide
of prosperity under the McKinley law,
according to the republican oracles, is
more instructive. Then the number
of failures was 8,866, with $11,811,890
assets and $188,811,510 liabilities. The
number was only 865 greater this year,
while the liabilities were actually 6$8,
180,876 less, and the proportion of as
sets to liabilities was 8 per sent.
greater.
This is a cold fact that the calamity
howlers will take good care to ignore.
A comparison of this year with last
by quarters will be notless instructive.
Following is a statement of the num
ber of failures and the amount of las
bilities by quarters for the two years
1894 and 1893:
FAlLUaRES. LlAsILItT1S.
194. 199.. 1894. 1898.
1stquarter.. 8.909 8.069 t49,085.o08 8,424.144
Zd quarter...2,589 8,170 8,470,251 181.43,07
5d quarter...2.;23 4.001 28,119.696 16.414.887
The comparison allows that both the
number of failures and the amount of
liabilities were greater during the first
quarter of this year, after the panic,
than they were during the first quarter
of last year, before the panic. It also
shows that both failures and liabili
ties for the second and third quarters
t this year were decidedly less than for
the corresponding quarters last year.
There was no panic during the first
quarter of 1893, and yet the number of
failures and the amount of liabilities
were both greater than during either
t the second or the third quarter of the
I present year. In other words, there
have been less business disasters in
the same length of time since the 1st
of April this year than there were dur
ing the first quarter of 1893, when, ac
cording to the protection philosophers,
I the country was still on the mountain
top of prosperity, where it had been
placed by the McKinley act.
The comparison shows that the panie
had nearly spent its force by the be
ginning of the present year and that
since the first quarter of the year fail
ures have not been more than ordi
narily numerous or disastrous.
This is another fact which the car
lamity howlers will keep out of sight
as much as possible. It is a fact
which, with many others, demon
strates that under a democratic ad
ministration and policy the country
has been recovering from the disas
trous effects of the republican panic of
1898.-Chicago Herald.

TO REMOVE STAINS.
isats an the mnst Methkds t 01 ahig on
Treet Jeu.e spots.
As the fruit season waxes it becomes
burdensome to keep delicate drapery
spoteless. Who has not beheld with
dismay one's favoi it damask hopeless
ly-it would seem-diseolored with
peach, cherry and berry stains? Soeme
Mtiggestions culled from that best of
teachers-experience-and that are not
generally knowi witay be of assistance
in remedying the nishtitp:
In the first place do not wash the
linen before applying other remedies;
to do so sets the stain almost indelibly,
and it then has to pass through-all
stages until time and the laundry leave
but a pale yellow reminder, which con
summation does not follow usually un
til the fabrie is threadbare. For berry
stains have somte one hold the cloth so
that it sags a little and pour absolutely
boiling water through the spot; rub
well. If this fails, light a bit of sul
phur and hold under the wet spot-a
lighted match will answer; a sulphur
ous gas usually does the work, the
stain gradually disappearing.
But there are some that, like Lady
Macbeth's "damned spot," will not
"out"-peach stains, for example. Then
you must have recourse to salts of
lemon, which is good, but apt to leave
a hole in lieu of the stain. By extreme
carefulness in its use, however, it will
not do such dire damage. Take a sunny
day for the task; first moisten the
spot and then rub on a very little of
the salts of lemon; lay the linen in the
sun for two or three minutes and then
wash thoroughly with soap and warm
water. Success nearly always follows.
Other ptains, like iron rust, are more
easily removed. After washing the
article, squeeze lemon juice on the spots
and then cover thickly with salt. Lay
in the sun all day, wash, and if the rust
is not entirely removed, repeat the ap
plication. This is equally good for ink
stains.-N. Y. Advertiser.

To Wake Orangle TWarmsalade.
With a sharp knife peel the oranges
as thin as possible, so as to avoid the
white inner skin. Shred the peel as
fine as possible, and throw it as soon
as cut into cold water. Scrape the
white skin carefully from the oranges
and cut them into small pieces, remov
ing the seeds. Take the peel from the
water, shake it dry and mix it with
the orange and juice. Weigh them
and put to them an equal weight of
nice granulated sugar (or a little less).
Put them in a preserving kettle and
sat them over the fire. Boil half an
hour and stir constantly to prevent
burning. When cold put up in jars.
Each Deash Plays a Thae.
A London paper states that an Amer~
Scan woman has lately received what
must be termed the most originalo
wedding presents. It is a musical din

to play a tune when put upon the

with marehes as suiting the temper 'f

Proper Way of Bolling Potatoes.
Put them when prepared in a liberal
quantity of slightly-salted boiling
water; keep them boiling gently until
tender enough to be pierced easily with
a fork, then drain off the water, dry
out for a few moments, shaking them
about occasionally in the kettle, cover
with a napkin or towel, and set the
kettle back on the range where tle po
tatoes wvill keep hot and the remain
moisture evaporate. Treated in -
manner they will be dry, mealy and
delicious. If they hav6 been balled
without paring, the skins can be read
ily removed, if desired, before the pq
tatoes are sent to -table. Some prefer
having them served in their skins, or
"with their jackets on." A medium
sized potato will boil perfectly in twen
ty-fve minutes. Boiled potatoes shourrld
be sent to table folded in a napkin.
