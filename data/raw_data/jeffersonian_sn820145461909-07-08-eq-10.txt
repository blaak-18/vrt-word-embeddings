Most Diseases Cause by Consf.pa*
tion. Sewerage of the Brain
“It goes to the brain naturally, and
to every part of the body, every organ
being fed on this polluted blood, or
sewerage. It goes to your face in the
form of pimple-poison and creaks out
on the skin. It goes to your head and
gives you headache and dizziness, it
goes to your brain and makes you
drowsy, it weakens the stomach and
causes dyspepsia, and bad breath, it
goes to the liver and causes bilious
ness, it goes to the kidneys and even
tually gives rise to Bright’s Disease,
it goes to the heart and makes it
thump, it goes to the eyes and they
lose their lustre, it makes your nerves
flabby and weak and out-of-sorts, and
this is the advance agent of all kinds
of disease, which you couldn’t get at all
if there was pure, rich, red blood flow
ing in your veins and your whole body
was in prime condition.”

What Our Farmers Are Saying
J TX • - Continued from
ana Doing page Th™
get it ill commercial fertilizers, or
(2) we can get it by the growing of
leguminous crops.
“We have tried the fertilizer plan
—that is, we have tried the putting
on of 4 to G pounds per acre, at a
cost of 20 cents or more a pound, to
replace that contained in the crops
we took off. In the seed of a cotton
crop making 250 pounds of lint to
the acre there will be about 16
pounds of nitrogen. This, at 20
cents, is worth $3.20 —much more
than the farmer gets for it. When
he puts on the land 300 pounds of
8-2-2 goods he applies only 6 pounds
of nitrogen, which costs him at least
$1.20, and leaves his land poorer by
10 pounds of nitrogen than it was in
the beginning. As Prof. Massey
says: “He sells the nitrogen in his
cotton seed at about 10 cents a
pound and buys back a fraction of it
in commercial fertilizers at 20 cents.’’
Then, if the land is left bare till the
next cotton crop is planted, the win
ter rains will wash out more nitro
gen than the crops remove. The re
sult of this method of trying to sup
ply nitrogen is shown in the low av
erage yields of all staple crops in the
South, in the thousands of acres of
land abandoned because they will no
longer produce enough to pay for
working them, in the low average
income and the consequent poverty
of Southern farmers.
“The second way to get this neces
sary nitrogen, the growing of legu
minous crops, is not an untried way.
The best farmers depend largely on
it, and there are few who have tried
it at some time or other. But it
should be the rule and not the excep
tion. No Southern farmer should
need to buy any nitrogen in com
mercial fertilizers, except for spe
cial crops or under special condi
tions where a quick-acting form is
needed. Crimson clover in the win
ter and cowpeas in the summer,
these two crops—not necessarily fol
lowing each other, ordinarily they
should not—would, if properly used,
in five years enable the farmers in
the South to grow better crops than
they now do without spending one
cent for nitrogen, where now $25,-
000,000 is expended.
“It is only a question of whether
the farmer will let nitrogen impov
erish him or make it help enrich
him. Can any one conceive of any
good reason for buying at 2 0 cents
per pound what he can get for noth
ing—can even get paid for taking?
For the legumes not only supply ni
trogen, they make the finest feed for
all sorts of stock; and if one-third
the land planted in cotton were each
year devoted to leguminous crops, in
five years, there would not only be
more bales of cotton made at a much
smaller cost per bale, but there
would also be more and better live
stock in the South, better crops of
all kinds, fewer bills to pay for feed
and ‘supplies,’ more money coming
in and less going out, richer farmers
and a more prosperous country.
“The most prosperous farmers of
the South, almost without exception,
get their nitrogen by growing le
gumes; the poorest ones get theirs
from the fertilizer bag. One way
leads to poverty, the other leads to
3effersottlan
prosperity; and it is for each man to
choose which path he will travel.”
TYPHOID FLIES.
Dr. George E. Beyer, who is an au
thority on questions of public health,
says:
“The house fly, the dirty fly, the
typhoid and cholera infantum fly,
will soon swarm in thousands and
millions, unless precautions are
taken. The house fly, whom we were
taught in oui’ childhood to treat with
kindness, has been exposed. Its hab
its are filthy. It breeds in stables
and garbage pails and carries the
filth it revels in and tracks it across
the sugar, the butter and the beef
steak. It paddles its horrid feet,
gummed with the vilest rotting mat
ter, in the baby’s milk. The doctors
have declared war on the house fly.
It probably disseminates every dis
ease. It is a nuisance. It must be
exterminated. It can be driven out
of every city. In an age of knowl
edge, screens and cheap disinfectants
there is no excuse for flies in any
household. Clean up your premises
and report to the health department
your neighbor who does not. Get
rid of breeding places of flies and
you will get rid of flies.
“There is no family so poor it can
not afford to screen its home. Screens
will turn away all flies as well as
mosquitoes. The unscreened house,
in other words, is a dangerous thing,
and screens on windows and outside
doors are an excellent investment
from several points of view.”
MONEY IN BUTTER.
There is a good profit in making
butter at home, if you can make a
high grade product and have a good
market for it. The creamery pays
you only for an exact pound of but
ter fat, with two or three pounds of
milk thrown in for nothing. Churn
ing the cream at home, you save the
cost of churning which the creamery
charges for; you gain about 16 per
cent, in weight of the butter; and
you gain the buttermilk. These
combined gains amount to about 25
per cent., or one pound in every
four. In other words, you make
about 25 cents on every dollar’s
worth of butter, if you make as
good butter as the creamery product.
By the use of the hand separator
it is possible to make the highest
grade of butter at home, provided
the cream is properly handled and
churned. By the use of the separa
tor you are not only able to make a
higher grade of butter and sell it for
a higher price, but you will be able
to extract more cream from the milk
and hence make more butter. Also,
the warm sweet skim milk will have
a higher food value either for hu
man use or for animal feeding. If
you keep more than three or four
cows, by all means buy a separator.
It will soon pay for itself. —Texas
