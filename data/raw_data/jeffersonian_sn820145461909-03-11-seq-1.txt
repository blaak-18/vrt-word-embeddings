Summary of Ebents as ''Eaey Happen
By Tom Dolan
The event of the previous week
was, of course, the inaugu-
ration of Wm. Howard Taft
as President on March 4th.
As usual, the blizzard’s

noise and enthusiasm of the Washing
ton crowds, and instead of a gala time
out of doors the oatlh of office was ad
ministered in the historic Senate
chamber by Chief Justice Fuller of
the Supreme Court, and many of the
parade features had. to be cut out.
A brief summary of the inaugural
address, which was very long, is as
follows:
Immediate revision of the Dingley
tariff, for which purpose Congress is
called to convene in extra session on
the 15th of this month.
An adherence to the “Roosevelt
policies ” in so far as regulation of
railroads and corporations is concern
ed, with a note in favor of relieving
the railroads from those provisions of
the Sherman anti-trust law which in
his opinion should not apply. (It was,
as will be remembered, the idea of
Mr. Roosevelt and Hamman to free
the railroads from the workings of the
Sherman law, put them under the au
thority of the Interstate Commerce
Commission end then—prevent the
Commission from exercising any par
ticular authority, it having been held
in one instance already that the Com
mission’s right to subpoena a witness
were very slender.)
These same anti-trust laws are also
to Ibe amended so that business men
can “be assured of that measure of
stability and certainty in respect to
those things that may be done and
those that are prohibited, which is es
sential to the life and growth of all
business. ’ ’
This is a good idea in Mr. Taft—-if
he will have the law speak for itself
absolutely, and not leave it to the ex
ecutive to say whether or not Federal
connivance shall be given to any un
lawful proceeding such as the Steel
Trust’s absorption of the Tennessee
Coal & Iron Company. But the Sher
man law is rather plain, and apparent
ly it is not so much interpretation as
elimination interested corporations de
mand.
More revenue must be raised for
the government. If this can’t other
wise be raised, Mr. Taft would favor,
he says, a graduated inheritance tax.
That is “Republican all over.” If
the pennies can’t be squeezed out of
the poor on their actual living as a
final, desperate resort, the rich might
be called on to give up a portion of
their legacies.
Bonds, more bonds, must be issued
for the Panama canal. He does not

squarely favor a lock type, but urged
that some kind of a ditch be made as
soon as possible.
A strong army and navy are urged
and economy not favored in these par
ticulars. Wants the President to be
enabled, through Federal Courts, to
enforce treaty obligations and the
<rights of foreigners” in the United
States. This is Rooseveltian central
ization with a vengeance.
Mr. Taft has nothing at all to of
fer on the money question (he’s get
ting his) but does favor a postal sav*
ings oank system.
Wants subsidies to establish steam
ships carrying mail to South America
and the Orient.
On the injunction question, he is
decided and desires that the courts re
tain this necessary power, under laws
insuring that it be not abused, and
Mr. Taft is also anxious for laws
against child labor and for bettering
labor conditions generally.
His address has been awaited with
particular interest in the South, where
he has spent many months in getting
acquainted with its people, and wq
therefore quote that part of his speech
’touching- the race question and his
policy toward the Southern States:
“I look forward with hope to in
creasing the already good feeling be
tween the South and the other sections
of the country.
“While the Fifteenth Amendment
has not been generally observed in
the past, it ought to be observed, and
the tendency of Southern legislators
today is toward the enactment of elec
toral qualifications which shall square
with that amendment. Os course, the
mere adoption of a constitutional law
is only one step in the right direction.
It must be fairly and justly enforced
as well. In time both will come.
Hence it is "clear to all that the dom
ination of an ignorant, irresponsible
element can be prevented by constitu
tional laws which shall exclude from
voting both negroes and whites not
having education or other qualifica
tions thought to be necessary for a
proper electorate.
(1 There was a time when Northern
ers, who sympathized with the negro
in his necessary struggle for better
conditions, sought to give him the suf
frage as a protection and to enforce
its exercise against the prevailing sen
timent of the South. The movement
proved to be a failure. What remains
is the Fifteenth Amendment to the
Constitution and the right to have
statutes of states specifying qualifi
cations for electors subjected to the
test of compliance with that amend
ment. This is a great protection to
the negro. It never will be repealed,
Atlanta, Ga., Thursday, March 11, 1909
and it never ought to be repealed.
“If it had not been passed, it might
be difficult now to adopt it; but with
it in our fundamental law the policy
of Southern legislation must and will
tend to obey it, and so long as the
statutes of the states meet the test of
this amendment and are not otherwise
in conflict with the Constitution and
laws of the United States, it is not
the disposition or within the province
of the Federal Government to inter
fere with the regulation by Southern
States of their domestic affairs.
“The negroes are now Americans.
* * * We are charged with the
sacred duty of making Their path as
smooth and easy as we can. Any rec
ognition of their distinguished men,
any appointment to office from among
their number, is properly taken as an
encouragement and taai appreciation
of their progress, and this just policy
shall be pursued.
“But it may well admit of doubt
whether, in the case of any race, an
appointment of one of their number
to a local office in a community, in
which the race feeling is so widespread
and acute as to interfere with the case
and facility with which the local gov
ernment business can be done by the
appointee, is of sufficient benefit by
way of encouragement to the race to
outweigh the recurrence and increase
of race feeling which such an appoint
ment is likely to engender. There
fore, the Executive in recognizing the
negro race by appointment must ex
ercise a careful discretion not thereby
to do it more harm than good. On
