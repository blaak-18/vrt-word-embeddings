WASHINGTON. D. C., March 18
To all people who believe in the
supremacy of the white race in diis
country it is most nauseating and
disgusting to say nothing of revolting
to read about the proposed drama
which Eugene O’Neill is trying to
stage, wherein a young white woman,
whose name is being withheld, has
agreed to play opposite a negro lead
hag man in an inter-racial play. “All
God’s Chillun Got Wings.”
This thing ought to be suppressed
before it ever starts in this country
for there is no telling to what it will
lead. This woman who does not want
to reveal her name is said to have
accepted the part after it had been
flatly refused by leading actresses
and many near stars.
Kisses -Negro’s Hand
Just think of it, the whitevwoman
is required, in the closing scene of
the play, to kiss the hand of the
negro whose wife she has become.
Can you imagine anything more re
pulsive than that? There is enough
racial trouble in America without
manufacturing more of it through
the drama which is calculated to stir
the negroes of the country to vio
lence towards the white race.
determination to go
through with the staging of his play
and make it is realistic as possible
with a white woman and a negro
man in the leading parts, has started
much talk in theatrical circles, and
la bringing down on him the wrath
•f all who love America and think
the white race should be supreme in
this country. It is terribly revolt
ing to all such good people and they
are calling for help to suppress the
same.
Will Cause Trouble
The plot of the play deals with in
termarriage among negroes and white
people and its scenes are laid in the
negro district of Manhattan. It is
the very thing which true Klansmen
Oppose and is bound to bring on

Invitational Meeting
CLEARFIELD, IA„ March 24.- An
invitational meeting was held by the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan at this
town last night, and many men affili
ated with the organization. Klan ac
tivities have been slow in this com
munity, because of the bad condition
of the r« a Is, but with the coining of
good weather, the all-American or
ganization will demonstrate just how
it can grow and become a real instru

INTER RACIAL PLAY
CAUSES DISCUSSION
Drama May Not He Shown Out
side of New York City Where
It Is Produced
COLUMBIA. S. C.. March 25.-Many
people in South Carolina are indig
nant over preliminary advertising of
a new drama soon to be staged by
Eugene O’Neill, a New York produc
er. According to the story, a young
woman, Mary Blair, has agreed, after
several leading actresses and many
near-stars had refused, to play oppo
site a negro leading man in an in
ter-racial play, “All God’s Chillun Got
Wings.” The white woman is re
quired. in the changing scenes of the
play, to kiss the hand of the negro,
whose wife she had become.
O’Neill’s determination <o go on
with the staging of his play and to
make it realistic with a white wo
man and a negro in the leading roles,
has caused much talk in theatrical
circles, and the prediction is made
that the play will never be shown
outside or New York City at the
Provincetown theater, where it is be
ing produced.
The fact that such a play is being
produced, a leading citizen of South
Carolina remarked today, shows the
need of some strict supervision and
control of the legitimate stage, and
he suggested that the Ku Klux Klan
might gain much additional popular
ity and good will by working to this
end.
trouble every where it is attempted
to be shown.
The woman who has been engaged
to take the leading famale part is
so ashamed of her act that she has
asked that her name be kept from
the public at least until tne play
opeais. When it was first offered to
a leading actress in this country she
indignantly refused, and was right
about it. Many others were asked to
take it and all refused until at last
one woman was found who agreed to
sell her reputation.

WASHINGTON. D. C., March 17.
Immigration is on its way towards
consideration on the floor of the
house of representatives and is sched
uled to come up next week, accord
ing to Chairman Johnson of the house
immigration committee. He doesn’t
believe that anything else will be run
in ahead of immigration after this
week.
The house is considering the bonus
bill and the navy appropriation bill
this week and immigration is on the
calendar to follow the first thing
next week. Chairman Johnson has
his coat and hat off and his sleeves
rolled up ready for a fight that he
anticipates will be staged when the
immigration bill comes up for discus
sion and debate.
* In the Senate
The senate immigration committee
has finished its public hearings before
the subcommittee and the Johnson
bill as presented to the house, is be
ing taken up for discussion by the
senate committee in t executive ses
sion this week. The last public hear
ing with the senate committee was
had with the representatives of the
Hebrew Immigrants’ Aid Society of
New York, which was seeking a mod
ification of restrictions now applying
to relatives of admitted aliens.

Churches and Radio
To disseminate more widely the
religious teachings of Christian
churches, radio broadcasting is be
ing undertaken by many of the larg
er denominations in the eastern part
of this country. This means of reach
ing millions of persons who might
have no other contact with religion
is a great thing. Throughout the
east every Sunday there is an invisi
ble audience listening in to many of
the great sermons and the fine music
al programs being heard in the
churches. The only thing the invisi
ble audience misses is the collection.
And one or two ministers have been
heard to extend a kindly invitation
to all whom he cannot see to send in
their checks and donations by mail.
It is well that the Christian people
of this country are up to date in tnis
matter, for it is now announced that
the Vatican will, in a few months,
adopt radio to spread the word of
the pope to millions of persons over
the world due to the efforts of a
company headed by Guglielmo Mar
coni, radio inventor.

Out in Dearer
If one reads the Denver papers he
must conclude that there is some
thing wrong out that way with offi

Denver cartoon shows the people of
that city held up at the point of a

A half page of a Denver paper
shows photos of bandit suspects and
bandit queens- and advertisement

DISBARS LAWYER
Oscar F. Johnson’s Connection
With Flogging Case Ends
Disastrously
RALEIGH, N. C., March
A. Grady, Grand Dragon of the Realm
of North Carolina, holding superior
court of the seventh judicial district
now presiding at Raleigh took action
on Tuesday, that is thought to be
without precedent in the history of
North Carolina. On his own motion,
he issued an order debarring Oscar F.
Johnson from practicing law in his
court until July 1, 1924. at the same
time he appointed Hon. H. Pou and
Col. Albert L. Cox as a committee
to prefer charges against Johnson be
fore the grievance committee of the
North Carolina bar association to the
end that he be permanently debarred
from the practice of law.
The temporary disbarment of
Johnson was an outgrowth of the re
cent flogging of Hayes Hanry, a ne
gro, by a masked band last Nevem
ber. J .C. Barrington, his son, Cecil
Barrington and a young white man
named Peddy, were indicted jointly
for complicity in the whipping. They
were tried before Judge Grady and
the elder Barrington was convicted
of aiding and abetting in the whip
ping.
The action of the court in disbar
ring Johnson arose from certain let
ters which had written to the Bar
ringtons. in which he offered his ser
vices in their behalf guaranteeing
certain results if employed by them.
Johnson admitted writing the letters
and sending Barrington a marked
copy of the jury list, but claimed
that the services offered were of a
private nature Ind not in his pro
fessional capacity.
The action of Judge Grady, which
was prompted by a desire to rid the
profession of inethical practioners,
brought about a meeting of the
Wake County Bar association at
which a committee was appointed to
prefer charges as set out in Judge
Grady’s charge.
Judge Grady is the Grand Dragon
of the Realm of North Carolina,
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
“Young Denver bandits foiled in
plan to break jail.”
“Prisoner makes escape by clever
ruse in shadow of station after ar
rest.”
“Woman nabbed in apartment af
ter capture of pair in big car.”
“Holdup suspect is identified.”
“Everyone in Denver is seriously
interested in the stickups, robberies
and assaults that are being commit
ted daily.”
“Uprisings of the citizens.”
Here’s one reason: “Seventy-eight
prisoners from the state reformatory
at Buena Vista have been turned
loose on the community on paroles in
the last six months, according to in
formation which Denver police have
furnished the juvenile court author
ities. The court is making an inves
tigation as to how many of the al
leged youthful bandits have been con
victed or arraigned in that court.”
Whenever the citizens of Denver
make up their minds to put a stop to
this sort of thing they can do it.
There ought to be sufficient Klans
men out there to furnish the proper
power to administer the laws as they
should be administered where offi
cials sworn to do their duty fail to
do it.

Are You » Scofflaw?
Two new words have been coined
up Massachusetts way. They are Ban
bug and Scofflaw. The word banbug
is a general word to apply to all per
sons advocating restrictions of vari
ous rights and privileges.
Scofflaw is the word that was se
lected by prohibition advocates in
Boston as an appellation for persons
who violate the laws.
These selections of words were
made out of over 30,000 entered in a
recent contest up in the Bay state.

Know the Backer
A correspondent of this bureau
sends in a lot of clippings taken
from the editorial writings of Arthur
Brisbane and wonders why such stuff
is put out all over the country in
newspaper form, in syndicated ma
terial, etc. Just stop to analyze the
writer of those paragraphs and know
from whom he takes his orders* and
you will have the answer.
Arthur Brisbane is the chief edi
torial writer employed by William
Randolph Hearst, and is said to draw
the largest salary ever paid to any
newspaper man in this country. He
is a brilliant and splendidly informed
man. but he is working for a man
who is pro-Catholic and therefore
takes his orders for that sort of ma
terial.
That ought to explain why so much
of Brisbane’s stuff carries nice little
paragraphs for the Catholic church
and so many kind things said for the
nuns and priests.
Brisbane also favors the aliens and
alien immigration, and if he had his
way would open the gates wide open
and let all of Europe come in that
could get here.

Insane Aliens
Somebody has discovered that large
sums of money are spent every year
taking care of insane aliens. That
being the case, aliens should be kept
out of this country who might be
come a public charge on us. Best
reason in the world for restricted
immigration.

(Bureau of Publication and Kduration)
WASHINGTON, D. C., March
18.—“ I should not like to be
quoted, especially after my ap
peal for religious tolerance, but
the Catholic church is in no way
suited to this country and can
never have any great perman
ent growth except through im
migration, for its though* is La
tin and entirely at variance with
the dominant thought of our
country and institutions.”
The above quotation is an utter
ance of former President Theodore
Roosevelt, made at the time he was
president, and has been dug up out
of private letters tvritten by Roose
velt’s military aide, Archie Butt, to
his sister-in-law. Archie Butt went
down on the Titanic, and Roosevelt
is likewise dead, and at this time
these letters of Butt’s have been
copyrighted by Doubleday, Page &
Co., and are being sent out and are
being republished in many of the big
daily papers of the country.
Talks With President
This particular article from which
the above quotation is taken, was
written by Archie Butt, under date
of January 20, 1909, and Butt was
telling his sister-in-law of the per
sonal side of the president. Butt had
just come back from accompanying
President Roosevelt to a big Metho
dist meeting in the Metropolitan
church here in Washington. As
Roosevelt left the church and he and
Butt were driving home Butt quotes
Roosevelt as talking to him as fol
lows:
“I would rather address a Metho
dist audience than any other audi
ence in America. You know for one
thing, that every one there is an
American. You do not have to think
about placating this element or that
element, for the Methodists are
Americans, and all you have got to
do is to hammer facts into them.
Liked Episcopalians
“Next to the Methodists I prefer
to address Episcopalians. They are
all Americans likewise, usually re
presenting the higher or else the
lower social class. The Methodists
represent the great middle class and
in consequence are the most repre
sentative church in America. I think
the Methodists and the Episcopalians
increase more rapidly than any other
churches in this country. They ap
peal to the genius of our institutions
more than any other denominations.
The growth of the Episcopal church
in the cities is marvelous. I thirst
the organization of the two churches
is very similar, and, after all, or
ganization tells in the long run.”
And right there in Roosevelt’s talk
is where he said what he did about
the Catholic church as quoted above.

of the Klan. He doesn’t call himself
a Klansman and on the other hand
doesn’t deny that he is one. What’s

MUCH ANTI-AMERICAN RELIGIOUS
PROPAGANDA SPREAD BY MOVIES
(Hurfia of Publication and Educatin'
WASHINGTON, D. C.. March 24-
Have you ever sat in the movies and
thought anything about the amount
of propaganda that is going on there
on the screen?
How many Protestant ministers
have you seen taking the roles of the
clergy? Has it ever occurred to you
that you nearly always find a Roman
Catholic prist on the job?
And then the less noted characters,
for instance the comon people, in the
attitude of prayer Have you noted
with satisfaction of the many who
cross themselves and bow to the
shrines and in some instances
images? Has it ever struck you as
peculiar that always It is the foreign
church, the foreign idea of religion,
the priests, nuns, and their work that
is being displayed on the screen be
fore the public?
The 100 per cent Americans are
sick of this sort of propaganda and
they are hungering for pictures that
picture Americans and American
sentiment on the screen in prefer
ence to the foreign ideas that seem
to be constantly exploited.
Don't think for a moment that this
is just a happen so far it is a will
ful, deliberate, cunning piece of pro
paganda that is going on daily. This
stuff is being fed nightly to your
children and our children as well as
to adults. Why? It makes an im
pression on youngsters of the im

CHICAGO. ILL., March 24.- Her
mosa Klan is typical of the organi
zations in Chicago. Unity and har
mony are the watchwords constantly
held before the membership, a large
percentage of which is actively work
ing towards the upbuilding of this
organization. This organization has
an average attendance of over 60 per
cent.
Headquarters, offices, and lecture
rooms are open every day from 1 to
11 p. m., and as a result of this fea
ture of the extension work, the mem
bership roll is increasing rapidly.
On March 11, it held a wonderful
meeting at which the “bunch” de
cided to try for a class of 100 for
naturalization at the last meeting
this* month. A buffet luncheon was
served, and the “song birds” with
their voices, violins and piano, con
tributed to the evening’s entertain
ment.
A contribution of SIOO was made
to the general welfare fund.
Hermosa is trying to carry her
share of the responsibilities in all
the activities being carried on in the
interests of a better citizenship.

it without thinking of what is going
on.
A relative of the writer often aski
the question: “Oh, when will the
sleepy Protestants ever wake up to
what is going on?” And she is about
right.
When are we going to sit up and
take notice, rub our eyes and get
wide awake to the amount of pro-
Eaganda that is taking place right
efore our very eyes. If the 100 per
cent Americans can ever get hep to
the situation we will be all right but
it takes a long time to arose public
sentiment to the boiling point. But
when it is once aroused, then look
out. There is where danger lurks.
Why not open our eyes and take
steps to right such conditions before
it requires force to overcome the
wrongs done an outraged public?
And then take another look at who
is running the movies? You don't
need to go away from home; just look
at the men in the business in your
home town. Personally they may be
good Americans and can’t help them
selves but just ask them where they
are compelled to buy their pictures,
and who they are forced to patron
ize.
