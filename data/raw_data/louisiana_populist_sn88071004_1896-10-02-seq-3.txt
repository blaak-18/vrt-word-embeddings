The seedhouse of the Givanovich
Oil Company was burned on the
night of bept. 25. It hadl not been
perfectly completed, and as the
-mill was not in operation, the own
era are at a loss to understand the
cause of tme ire, and attribute it
either to spsatsaeous combustion
'or to iacemdiarism. The former
theory is probably the eorreet one.
At the time of the ire, which oc
eared at midnight, there was be.
tween $1000 and 61500 worth of
seed stored in the bahkling. This
is a total loss, together with sonme
maclinery that had not been plao
ed in position and the greater part
ot the electrie light plant. The
structure was covered by a build
er risk of $3000 in the Mechanies
and Traders' Insurance Company
of New Orleans, represented by
Messrs. IAmee I Tucker, of this
city. The las is estimated at about
666. The bllditg will be rebuilt

Amicable Fusion Between Pop.
ulists and Democrats.
The Special Committee of nine
representing the People's party
and the sub-committee of six rep
resenting the Democratic party
met at Baton Rouge on the 24th
inst., and two days were spent be
fore an agreement was finally
reached.
Many propositions were advanc
ed by the Populists looking to a di
vision on congressmen and a full
vote for Watson electors, but these
were unsuccessful, and the follow
ing was finally adopted on the part
of the Populists by a vote of 6
yeas, 1 nay, and 2 absent, and was
unanimously accepted by the Dem
ocrats.
As the agreement indicates, there
will still be a Democratic and a
People's party ticket on the official
ballot with different headings but
the same electors.

on "why I am Populist," at the
conclusion Mr. Lacas "moved that

draft proper resolutions, and to
report at the next meeting. The
chair then appointed N. V, Bush,
E. M. Shackelford, Winm. Dowty,

Mr. Bush then moved that the

on invitation.
Mr. Lacas moved as a substitute
that five be appointed instead of

inees and save this country from
plutocratic rule, declaring that it
was a question of meat and bread
with the poor people. He closed
amid applause.
Mr. Bush was then called for,
and in a forcible speech of one
hour and 20 minutes, poured hot
shot and shell into both old parties,
and in conclusion declared that this
was a battle royal, not between
McKinley and Bryan, or Sewall and
Watson, but between the Populist
and Democratic party as to wheth
er it was silver or the utter anni
hilation of the Populistparty.
On motion of Mr. Dowty the
club adjourned to meet Saturday,
Oct. 3d, at 7:30.

Washington, D. C. Sept. 26th. '96.
The great National Campaign is
now nearing the point where the
hardest and most decisive fighting
begins, Presidential campaigns,
as a rule, are won or lost during
the month of October. It is clear
that Bryan has the people with
him now. Nothing but the expen
diture of an *emmense amount of
money or some unforseen turn of
alaira can defeat him. Yet every
hinds in doubt.
Literary bureau of the Na
tional Democratic Committee has
been removed to Chicago. They
learned that they could get out
plates for weekly newspapers and
documents cheaper from that
point.
Your correspondent learns at
People's party headquarters that
tb have more demands for the
fdr entitled "The. wage earner
and Free Silver" than for any oth
er doument whb h they publish.
Load eommittem are ordering
these folders and are placing one
in bth hands of every man who
works for wages and small salaries
in order that they may see both
.Metof the question and deter
mine for themselves, with all thel
facts before them, how they shall
vote. This is considered a com
plete and effective reply to the
gold circular, which the railroads
and other corporations are hand
ing out to their employees to try
to array tho wake-earner against
the wealth-producer in this tight.
The action of the rail-road compa
nies in okldly entering into poli
tics, and becomingthe active and
aggressive allies of the gold men,
is forcing rapidly the question of
public ownership of transporta
tion t) the front. In short, they
are making every silver man
come over to the Populist position
that the Government should own
ani operate the means of transpor
tation, not only so as to take these
agencies of commerce out of poli
tics, but also to give the people
lower transportation rates and to
insure that no discrimination shall
be made against any class of our
people or any section of the coun
try. It is safe to say that half of
the corruption that has occurred
in Congress and State legislative
halls has been through railroad
lobbies and railroad inluences, di
rect or indirect. Next to a cor
rect financial system nothing
could do more to add to the pros
perity of our people and to purify
our politics and the administration
of our Government than for the
means of transportation to be op
erated at cost for the benefit of all
the people, as the postal system
is now operated. It is sure to be
the next great leading question in
our National Campaign.
WATSON MAKES A GREAT IMPRES
SION IN THE WEST.
Reports received at People's
party headquarters show that 'Wat
son has made as brilliant a cam
paign in the West as Bryan is,
now making in the East. The
National Committee is having Wat
sons great speech delivered at
Lincoln Nebraska printed as a
campaign document, and will dis
tribute it in large ntumbers.
Dates are now being arrahged for
Watson during the month of Oc
tober, immediately after the close
of the Georgia campaign.
BRYAN'S MARVELOUS CAMPAIGN.
The camprign which Mr. Bryan
is now making is the most marvel
ous feat ever known in American
politics. His physical endurance
is not only marvelous, but his ca
pacity for making a speech, with
new illustrations, every day, is the
wonder of the greatest orators and
the ablest campaigners in the
country. His speeches which are
all extemporanious, of course, are
taken down by Stenagraphers, ver
batim, and reported, word for
word, just as he speaks, yet the re
port of these extemporaneous
speeches appear in type as connect
ed, as logical, an I as well rounded
ap the best carefully prepared
speeches ever delivered or publish
ed. The man's power is develop
ing every day, and to the great
alarm of his political opponents.
ORGANIZED LABOR STANDING SOLID
LY FOB SILVER.
In view of the desperate efforts
the gold men are making for the
labor vote, it is interesting to note
that every labor paper in the coun
try that is the organ of a large la
bor organisation is for Bryan andi
free silver. A little over a year
ago the oficere of all.the labor ad
farmer organi~ations of the eoun
try joined in a petition to Con
gress to open the mints to the free
and unlimited coinage of silver at
16to 1. The factis that the far
mers ad organized labor has forc
ed this financial question to the
front.

WATSON THE FRIEND OF ORGANIZED
LABOR.
In this connection it is also inter
esting to note that lion. Thos. E.
Watson, the People's party candi
(late for Vice President. has al
ways been -a strong friend and
champion of organized labor. Be
fore Watson ever went to Congress
he was frequently invited to deliv
er labor addresses Which were so
strong andl eloquent that they were
reproduced in many of the labor
journals of the country. In the
spering of 1x93, while Watson was
in Congress, he led the fight for
the automatic car coupler, and the
passage of the bill providing for
this humane improvement was due
more to his efforts than to the ef
forts of any one else. Watson al
so took a strong stind for the
eight hour law, while in Congress.
Also against the Pinkerton thugs
who were hired by monopolists to
shoot down working men when
they protested against wrongs and
demanded justice. Watson has
frequently been thanked by the la
bor orgarizations for the bold
stand which he took while in Con
giess in their behalf. Mr. Watson
also took an active part in expos
ing and throttling an infamous bill
tnat it was attempted to pass
through Congress to strengthen
and enlarge the standinig army.
No paper in the .United States
took a stronger stand for Mr.
Debs, and more vigorously de
nounced the action of the Federal
Court in imprisoning Mr. D)ebs
without a trial by jury, and in de
nouncing Clevelands high-handed
act in sending Federal troops into
Illinois against the protest of its
Governor t'an dlid Mr. Watson's
paper. The laboring men know
from Mr. Watson's record that he
is their true and tried friend.
THEIR ONLY HOPE FOR? MCKINLEY.
The following editorial appears
in this week's issue of the Raleigh
(N. C.) Caucasian, Senator But
lor's paplr.
"Now since the joint electoral
ticket has been arranged in this
State the silver m:,n have a chance
to unite their votes and to defeat
the gold-bugs. There is but one
hope loft for McKinley and the
gold-bugs, and that is for the vo
ters who oppose the gold stanlard
to fail to support the joint electo
ral ticket. The Charlotte Observ
er is quick to see and seize upon
-this opportunity to help McKinley
and defeat Bryan, though profess
ing to support him. The follow
ing is its editorial advice to its
readers under date of Sept. 23rd.
"Men whose boast is that they
have never scratched the Demo
cratic ticket aml never voted
against a Democratic nominee can
not afford this year to vobt for a
lot of populist electors who will
vote for a populst for Vice Presi
dent against the democratic nomi
nee. It is their duty to scratch
the name of every populist from
the electoral ticket and to vote for
those men who will vote for the
democratic candidate. In so doing
it cannot be said that they are
scratching the democratic ticket,
for it cannot be claimed that this
hybrid affair is one."
Now what could please Mark
Hanna and the gold-bugs better
than this? Democrats to scratch
populist electors, and populists to
scratch democratic electors. If
enough of this is done, of course
the McKinley electors will be elect
ed. This is what the Observer's
advice would lead to. Is this
what the Observer desires? If
any so-called delmoerat wants to
scratch a populist elector, let him
do it. He will simply prove that
he is the agent of MeKinley in dis
guise. But populists are not
made of that kind of stuffi Every
one will vote the joint electoral
ticket, because every one wants the
defeat of the McKinley electoral
ticket. The Charlotte Observer
has now found a chance to elect
McKinley, but no populist will be
come a partner of the Observer
and its gold-bug scheme,"
Mayor Strong of New York
city refuses to allow a stand to be
built in the city for Mr. Bryan to
speak from. This is the first
time that the Mayor of New York
has ever refused to allow a stand
to be put up for any public speak
er representing a great party.
Thisis a species of the littleness
and persecution that will help mcre
than it hurts. The American peo
ple believe in fair play, and the
gold men will make no converts
by trying to stille free speech.
Mayor Strong said a few weeks
ago that Mr. Bryant made votoes
for the gold men wherever he
spoke, but now he belies his own
words. He is afraid for MP, Bry
an to) tll the truth to the icople of
New York who have so long been
kept in the dark by the gold-bug
press.
