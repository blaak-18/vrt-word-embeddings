Masonic Lodge.
We had the pleasure last week
ot beiug present,at the ceremony
of perfecting the organization of
Solotuan Masonic Lodge No. 221,
of I'ineville, and installing the
officers eieot. The ceremonies were
conducted by the Olliver Lodge of
Alexandria, uuder the Su spices of
our esteinable young frieud John
M. Barrett Esq., who read special
authority tioin the Gjand Lodge
to that effect. The ..ceremonies
were beautiful and impressive and
were watched with lunch interest,
and listened to with undivided at
tention by the large gathering of
the families and friends of the
members of the two Lodges who
had been specially invited to wit
ness the proct HMigs.
The fiue hull of-the new lodge in
Pine vi lie was handsomely decpra
ted aud with the Wasteful insignia
of the masons, together with the
regaiu, as wo *u by tho masons
themselves prest J a very im
posing appearance.^
We were, as the events them
selves transpired, much impressed
with the oath administered to our
worthy fellow citizen George W.
Bolton Esq*, as master of the new
Lodge aud with the religions char
acter of the ceivmouies, and when af
ter the sacramental part of the pro
ceedings were over, the talented and
devoted minister of the Episcopal
Church here, Rev. Abuei N.Ogdeu,
who had been chosen as the orator
of the occasion, proceded in as neat,
chaste and eloquent an adaress as
we have ever listened to, to explain'
the objects and some of the teach
ings of inasouary, we were con
vinced of the fact that when one is
a good mason it is impossibles that
be should not be a good christian,
good citizen and worthy man in all
the walks of life. #~
We had hoped to h'avtf been able
to lay Mr Ogdeu's addrefs before
onr readers this week, bat we
promise it tor our next.

District, marched in hia
colored mob with ahns in their
bauds during open session cf court,
forcibly carried away prisoners on
trial, aud bid defiance to.the Judge
and feherriff.
During a ti excitement, caused
by tbe burning of the hanse of
Phillips, Ward with bis colored
troops made many arrests without
the sanction of law or authority for
so doing. During this reign of
terror, Mr. Yanu a respectable
white man in the parish, denied
the authority of Ward to make his
arrest, and for this offence Ward
ordered him executed on tbe spot.
II is orders were executed by his
mob of negroes, and Yann was
murdered ill cold blood. Alter
many other deeds of lawlessness
and crime, tbe State authorities af
ter long delay and some trouble
di&ajmed him. His last etlortt was
to organize the negroes at Colfax
take possession ol the ofiiees and
install a set of usurpers, over the
regularly elected offices ot the Par
ish. This conspiracy led to the
recent troubles in that Parish: aud
had he bqen permitted to carry ont
his design would have driven the
white people from their homes.
This savage captain is one of the
political leaders ofthat parish, and
lias doue more than ail the rest to
destroy the peace and harmony be
tween the white and colored races.
Ward is the principal witness
against thetColfax prisoners, a con
spirator, a murderer, with the blood
of the iunoeent white men dripping
from his fingers, he is heard in a
court o f justice agaiuat these
prisoners and on his testimony and
others of the same ila they have
been deprived of their liberties and
refused the right of bail.
Another witness who was beard
against them, we understand, is
the friend aud the courant e >mpan
ion of Ward in all his critneeaud
deeds of blood. One who recently
formed a " conspiracy" with seven
others, Ward'» negro henchman,
and perpetrated that horrible out
rage an the person of Mrs. Laccr
and her daughter.
Whit# «eu may be murdered,
white women be ravished, aud
negro perpetrators of these crimes
become heroes ; yet white men who
were forced to defend their homes
agaiust this bloated savage aud
bis inob have according to the
opinion of Mr. Beckwxth, become
