Amos Rucker 9 Colored
Confederate Veteran
(Concluded from Page 3)
May many years pass o’er your head
Ere the last sad bell shall toll
To tell that faithful Rucker
No more shall call the roll.
By a singular incident, Rucker was
reported dead several weeks before
the time of his actual demise, and
while he was still in moderately good
health. One of his own color, pre
suming upon his many well-known
friendships among the white people,
made a round of stores and business
offices, stating that Rucker -was dead
and asking for money with which to
bury him. He had, evidently, how
ever, reckoned not fully enough upon
the extent of the old man’s popular
ity, for the news spread, and, not con
tent with sending contributions, a
number of prominent citizens hurried
to the home of the supposed corpse
with hearse and every equipment
for a proper funeral. What was their
surprise to be met at the corner of
the street by the cheerful, though
surprised, Rucker himself. The
bearer of the false tidings was haled
into police court upon the charge of
obtaining money under false pre
tenses, there to be faced by the al
leged dead man, who indignantly de
nied that he was dead, or, if he had
that he should have entrusted
his funeralizing to “any such a low
down, trifling nigger”. Not more
than four weeks later the funeral
cortege again turned into the nar
row street where Amos and his old

wife had lived so long. The old man
lay really dead this time.
The body of the President of the
Confederacy once lay in state in At
lanta, noted Confederate generals
have slept there before the eyes of a
loving populace, and yet none of
these obsequies have furnished a
more unique or dramatic picture
than did the burial of this simple old
negro.
Shrouded in his uniform of Con
federate gray, he lay, beneath the
drapery of a great Confederate flag,
in the undertaking parlors, which
were visited by hundreds of respect
ful friends, both black and white.
The funeral services were most im
pressively said by General Clement
A. Evans, that gallant “fighting
priest”, who is commander of the
veterans. The pall-bearers who vol
unteered their services, were ex-
Governor Allen D. Candler, Gen
eral A. J. West, Judge Lowndes
Calhoun, Dr. Amos Fox, ex
postmaster; F. A. Hilburn, Com
mander of Camp Walker, U. C. V.;
J. Sid Holland and R. S. Osborne.
Very lovingly these distinguished
citizens and veterans bore their old
companion to the grave, which was
covered by beautiful flowers, among
the handsomest of which was the of
fering of the Daughters of the Con
federacy. Camp Walker, U. C. V.,
not only defrayed all expenses, but
undertook to provide a lot in which
Amos Rucker’s wife shall lie beside
him.
In all the years in which Rucker
was a member of Camp Walker, he
Gfee 3effersonlan
had never missed a meeting until the
Monday night before his death, when
to Commander Hilburn came the
message: “I am awful sorry I can’t
be with you tonight, but I am too
sick. Give my love to the boys!”
This, the last message of the faith
ful old soul, was a fitting close to a
life, the story of which is one of
simple love and loyalty worth the
telling in this day of dissention,
doubt and discord.
A Monument to Rucker.
A movement to erect a monument
to the memory of Amos Rucker has
been started. Subscriptions for the
purpose may be sent to E. H. Alley,
Historian of Camp W. H. T. Walker,
Atlanta, Ga., or to Uncle Remus’s
Home Magazine. All money sent in
care of the Magazine will be turned
over to Mr. Alley. The following re
quest for donations has been made:
“To the Business Men and Citizens
of Atlanta: E. H. Alley, Esq., His
torian of Camp W. H. T. Walker,
kindly solicits donations for the erec
tion of a monument, not to exceed
one hundred dollars, to be placed
over the remains of Amos Rucker,
who was well known in the city of
Atlanta. He was a faithful servant,
devoted to his master, and respected
by all Confederate soldiers who
knew him in the Army of Virginia.
After the ‘War between the States’
he remained, until his death, true to
the type of the old negroes who nev
er lost for a moment their respect for
a true Confederate soldier. He at
tended all the reunions of the Con
federate soldiers, when he had the
strength to reach them. In the dis
charge of his duty he was not only
faithful in the service of his master,
but was severely wounded while fear
lessly exposing his person on the bat
tle fields where the company to
which his master was attacked made
a noble record. All contributions
you may see proper to make for the
erection of a suitable monument
over the grave of this faithful old
negro man will be highly appreci
ated."
The Reason Why
(Concluded from Page 10)
though under present conditions
there seems to be but little encour
agement to engage largely in the
industry or to invest much money
in pure bred animals. The meat
trust is a barrier of no mean impor
tance, and, farmers too must rid their
pastures of the fever tick. With the
tick eliminated, the government
quarantine will be removed, thus
permitting shipments to any market
if by such shipments a paying mar
ket can be found. The elimination
of the tick will also permit the in
troduction of improved breeds and
thus the standard of individual ex
cellence will be raised to a higher
level. Under the salubrious climatic
conditions prevailing in the South
land, well bred cattle can be grown
to a remarkable age for less money
than where the rigors of a northern
winter must be faced, hence, even at
prices prevailing, galling as they are
because of the absence of parity be
tween price paid to the producer
and price charged the consumer,
there is some profit. Some profit di
rect and much profit indirectly, for
land occupied by cattle will become
very rich, and, fertile lands bring
abundant harvests. We herewith
charge the meat trust and the local
dealers in meat, with whatever dam
age may have been caused the South
by reason of any failure encountered
by southern men in raising beef for
the southern markets.
The cattle tick has to do with the
growth and full development of cat
tle and should be eradicated. The
government has given the matter at
tention for years and made liberal
appropriation for fighting this pest
and it should have the co-operation
of each Southern State and every
farmer in the South, but the tick has
naught to do with present prices of
fat cattle on southern markets. The
tick has much to do with the grow
ing of cattle, the trust has all to do
in depressing the prices of southern
steers.
THE FARMERS’ UNION.
The Farmers’ Union is capable of
doing great good, and if operated on
wise lines it will prove itself strong
er than the money power. The
farmers must pull together and see
that the wealth and power of the
few shall be turned to the uses and
benefit of the many. The farmers
should strive to get control of govern
mental affairs into the hands of the
people, and change our farming edu
cational methods to reach the masses.
Some advise that we should keep
out of politics; I say stay in. Stop
sending so many lawyers to the Leg
islature. If farmers are not quali
fied, educate them. If your Congress
man does not serve your interests,
unite against him. Make the legisla
tive bodies force publicity on the
corporation, and punish the violators
of the law among the wealthy and
powerful as severely and as surely
as they do among the poor and -weak.

THE BARBED-WIRE FENCE.
By R. Andrews.
All honor to thd man who first
The barbed-wire fence did make;
By some he may be roundly cursed,
My praises he can take.
Demand so pressing he has met
On plains so long and wide;
But for his art, we’d have to let
Broad acres lie outside.

And then the man who loves his ease,
No longer finds a seat,
His lounging laziness to please,
On barbs that pierce his meat!
For his invention, so renowned,
I thank the inventor twice,
Because in it I now have found
A moral of great price.
’Tis this: In action and in mind,
The neutral is pretence;
It is impossible to find
A true man on the fence!
