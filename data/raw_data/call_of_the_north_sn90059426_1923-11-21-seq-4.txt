KLANSMEN'S WAR ON VICE AND GRAFT
IMPROVES MORALS AND POLITICS
Best Citizens of Nation Organized Under Fiery Cross Influ
ence Communities for Good, Eliminate Corruption in
Public Office and Support Protestant Churches.
Small town bootleggers and city
“dive” keepers; “tricky” justices of
the peace and dishonest governors;
scheming individuals and gigantic
anti-American organizations are feel
ing the restraining influence wielded
by the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
The formation of Men’s Bible school
classes and the attendance of men
and boys at church services is at a
height never before attained. Such
are the reports of investigators from
the villages and metropolises of the
United States.
These results are being obtained,
not by a demonstration of that puni
tive and mandatory power that the
organization’s more than three mil
lion members gives it, but by educa
tional- propaganda, personal example
and the awakening of a better com
munity spirit by individual Klans
men and their officials.
In many instances when laws have
been violated the Klan has furnished
the authorities with the evidence
necessary for conviction, and has aid
ed in the prosecution of the guilty.
In no instance has the Klan taken
the law into its own hands.
With that secrecy for which it is
notable the Klan has moved in mys
terious ways to protect young girls
in remote sections where a breath of
gossip would wreck a reputation and
ruin a life. In cities, where organ
ized vice has already ensnared help
less victims it has moved just as
mysteriously and effectively to res
cue unfortunates.
“Dumps,” operated in most cases
by low-class foreigners, on the out
skirts of many a small town, have
been closed by their proprietors
when the patrons learned that their
comings and goings were observed
by the “Unseen Eye.” City “joints”
have closed when the best citizenship,
organized in the Ku Klux Klan, has
demanded law enforcement at the
hands of the police and the “higher
ups.”
That such accomplishments have
met with opposition goes without
/saying. In some communities the
vicious element has organized to op
pose the sweep of the reform wave
set in motion by subjects of the “In
visibles Empire.” In a number of
instances it has been necessary for
the Klan to go to the polls to put
officers on the job who would co
operate by enforcing the law.
Hundreds of«thousands of dollars
have been spent throughout the
United States in the propaganda to
discredit the organization by those
whose revenue and political power
comes from dens of iniquity and cor
ruption in public office. In some sec
tions the enemy is still undefeated,
but the Klan is beginning to concen
trate its forces for intensive “drives”

in such centers as New York, Chi
cago, Boston, Pittsburgh, San Fran
cisco, New Orleans and Portland.
These “drives” are gotten under
way by the enlistment of great num
bers of native born, white, Protest
ant, Gentile men whose character and
integrity are unquestioned. Once in
the great patriotic organization these
men are asked to exert their influ
ence for good through the Protestant
churches that they are encouraged to
attend. They are urged to take an
interest in local politics and to nomi
nate and support men of the highest
caliber. They are made to see the
importance of assuming leadership
for good in the several civic, fra
ternal or other organizations to which
they belong. And finally, through
the Klan itself, with its far-reaching
lines of influence, they are sworn to
work for the best interest of home,
church and country.
That the Klan does have lines into
places of power and that it does not
hesitate to use its influence is no
longer a secret. Numbering among
its membership some of the very
highest officials in the government,
senators, congressmen, governors,
legislators, army and navy officers
and men, mayors, educators, minis
ters, captains’of industry and finance,
and those powerful, of less known lo
cal leaders who transact the busi
ness of “Main Street” throughout
the country, it is in touch with con
ditions, and is in a position to in
fluence them for the better, as no
other organization can do.
Assurance that this tremendous
power is used only for good is given,
first by its personnel, which can only
be of the best type of American citi
zens; second, by the intimate knowl
edge and control that local and na
tional officers, chosen because of
their recognized worth, have of all
activities of the organization; third,
by the inherent love of justice which
must be possessed by every man ad
mitted into the Klan; fourth, by the
searching, binding and sacred oath
that every Klansman takes when he
assumes the duties of a citizen/ of
the “Invisible Empire” that figura
tively embraces and in reality pro
tects these United States.
Does Not Assume Credit
The Klan does not assume all the
credit for the present trend toward
law enforcement, particularly the
enforcement of the Volstead act, but
its leaders point out that in at least
two states —Pennsylvania and Illinois
—in which he Klan has been most
active recently, there has been a pub
lic demand for action on the part of
officials. In other states in which the
Klan has been intensely active there
has been noted a marked public de
mand for efficiency, honesty and sin-
cerity in the conduct of high offices.
Oklahoma, Oregon and Indiana are
among those states in which such a
condition prevails.
That the press, the pulpit and the
publicist is beginning to appreciate
the ideals and activities of the Klan,
despite the vicious and extensive
campaign constantly waged against
it, is evidenced by less biased edi
torial expressions in such represent
ative papers as the “New York
Times,” owned by the eminent Jew,
Mr. Adolph Ochs, and the “Chicago
by the pro-Klan sermons
from thousands of pulpits each Sun
day, and by the implied endorsement
given when, despite the demands of
impassioned anti-Klan clergymen,
such distinguished groups as % the
Rock River Conference of the Meth
odist Episcopal church, decline to
pass condemnatory resolutions; and
by the attitude of these leaders of
thought, former Vice President Mar
shall, Rev. Newell Dwight Hillis, pas
tor of Plymouth church, Brooklyn;
Judge George Fleming Moore, author
and editor, who consecrate their pens
and their eloquence to teaching those
basic American ideals for which the
Klan stands.
The Klan’s power for good in the
United States and its activities in
behalf of Protestantism is also dis
closed by the character of the oppo
sition that it has encountered. This
opposition has come principally from
the Roman Catholic hierarchy, as
represented by the Catholic press,
the Knights of Columbus, the Ancient
Order o* Hibernians, the Catholic
Order of and from the
Irish Catholic political clique which
nominates, or seeks to dominate, na
tional, state and municipal govern
ment, with the perequisites that go
with police authority, taxing enact
ments and 'fund-spending privileges.
Some few Jewish leaders, racial
group sponsors, and Negroes, unin
formed as to the real purposes of the
Klan, have aligned themselves with
those who fight the Klan, but the
men of these categories who are sin
cere in their Americanism are rap
idly becoming sympathetic, if inac
tive, allies of the organization.
Such groups as the “American
Unity League,” the “Knights of the
Flaming Circle,” the “Four Broth
ers,” and the “Minute Men of the
Constitution,” formed for the finan
cial gain or personal and political
glory of their promoters, are also
fighting the Klan, but their efforts
are insignificant and unworthy of no
tice, except that they reveal an igno
rance and gulliblity among Ameri
cans that the extension of the public
school system, for which the Klan is
working, will eliminate in coming
generations.
The CALL OF THE NORTH
CATHOLICS PUT BAN
ON CHRISTIAN CHURCH
—K-K-K
Congregation Finds Padlock on Door
on Arriving at Church for
Worship.
—K-K-K
Troy, Kansas, Nov. 13.—Catholics
secured an injunction against the
Christian church here and, armed
with a court order, put a padlock on
the door and restrained Evangelist
Edward Clutter from holding serv
ices. The trouble started when Rev.
Clutter brought a national Klan
speaker to his church for an address.
Catholic pressure and a threat of a
business boycott was brought to
bear, it s said, on members of the
church board, who capitulated to the
Catholics and asked the preacher tq.
resign. » The congregation, by an
overwhelming majority, voted to re
tain Rev. Clutter.
The Catholics then secured a court
order restraining Rev. Clutter from
preaching or permitting others to
hold services in the church. The
next evening the minister’s wife con
ducted the services, and the follow
ing day a large padlock was placed
on the door of the church, barring
her and others from holding divine
services in a house dedicated to the
service of God in a country whose
constitution gives its citizens the
right of free speech and public as
sembly. i

REALM OF ARIZONA
HOLDS KLORERO
The Klorero of the Realm of Ari
zona was recently held at Glendale,
and delegates were present from all
the Klans of the Realm.
Reports from every section of the
Realm indicate a great amount of
constructive, educational work being
done and the upbuilding of the spirit
of Klankraft everywhere.
Resolutions were passed express
ing the continued loyalty and co
operation of the Klansmen of Arizo
na to the regularly constituted offi
cers of the Klan at Atlanta, and Im
prial Wizard Dr. H. W. Evans was
memorialized in appreciation of his
work in the interests of Klankraft
throughout the nation and in appre
ciation of the co-operation given by
him and other imperial officers to the
Klansmen of Arizona.
The true, spirit of Klankraft was
exemplified by the Klansmen present
by their expression of a determina
tion to do everything in their power
to bring about a more wholesome
respect for the laws of the land and
to do all in their power to protect
the interests of the free public
schools by placing on school boards
as trustees only those who have at
heart the best interests of the free
public schools.

DENVER KLAVERN IS
ON MOUNTAIN PEAK
Denver Klan, Realm of Colorado, a
few days ago foi'mally opened its
splendid new Klavern building, which
is one of the most unique in the In
visible Empire.
Denver’s Klavern is situated on the
very top of Castle Mountain, a six
thousand-foot peak which is owned
by Denver Klan. It is located in
grounds comprising three hundred
acres which with the building are
valued at over $75,000.
At the dedication ceremonial six
thousand Klansmen were present and
took part in the naturalization of fif
teen hundred aliens, one of the largest
classes in the history of Colorado
Klankraft. The Grand Dragon of
Colorado officiated at the ceremonies
at which a fiery cross 110 feet high
was illuminated at the top of the
peak, being visible for miles in all
directions.
The Klans in Colorado are grow
ing rapidly under the guidance of the
Grand Dragon of that Realm. In
Pueblo a few weeks ago two hundred
aliens were naturalized into the local
Klan which is considered one of the
model Klans of the country. Pueblo
Klan is a very vital force in the civic
life of that city.
Trinidad Klan last week naturaliz
ed fifty-six aliens. At Greely, Colora
do, seventeen hundred Americans
heard a lecture an Klanskraft, brav
ing a drizzling rain a few days ago.
As a result over one hundred joined
the Klan. This Klan plans a great
celebration Thanksgiving Day, by
which time they expect to have grown
to seven hundred and fifty members.
New Klans have been formed at
Rocky Ford, Manzanola, Fowler, Can
on City and LaFayette during the
past few weeks.

Western Part of State Has Seen

We must not forget to mention
Kandiyohi county. Gladly that coun
ty arose and accepted the Klan. Very
little hesitation on the part of eligi
ble men has been observed. Willmar
now shows a Klan strength that
means to do things for the better
ment of American people, not only in
Kandiyohi county or the State of
Minnesota, but the entire nation.
Chippewa county has had a Klan
for a long time, but although during
the past thirty days it has not grown
very rapidly, today shows a re-awak
ening that points to bigger achieve
ments. We can look to Montivideo
for surprising reports of membership
growth from now on.
Lac qui Parle and Swift counties
have made an enviable mark, yet they
are not satisfied, and are reaching out
with ap enthusiasm that thrills be
yond words.
Renville and Yellow Medicine coun
ties are permanently on the Klan
map. Hundreds of men are coming
into the great Protestant organiza
tion, demanding an opportunity for
service to the cause of Americanism.
A few months back, the mayor and
city council of Redwood Falls denied
Klan lecturers the right of free
speech but are now dailjf being re
pudiated by the people of Redwood
county, as revealed through a large
number of applications ■ coming into
the state office, and are being given to
field workers. '
From Crookston comes a challenge
which calls to the rest of the state to
look to their laurels. The leaders of
the Klan in Polk county tell us to
watch and note well the growth of the
Klan in their section of the state.

GIGANTIC PARAGE
IN SUFFOLK COUNTY

Rows of Klansmen Extend for Two
Miles—Large Class of
Candidates Initiated.
—K-K-K -
New York, Nov. 13. — What is said
to be the largest meeting ever held
by the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
in Suffolk county took place last
Tuesday evening and it was estimated
that 30,000 persons were on hand to
watch the initiation of a. large class
of candidates.
Five thousand automobiles were
lined along streets of Bay Shore
to watch ' the parade to the polo
grounds where the initiation took
place.
The paraders made a spectacular
sight as they passed through the
streets and were greeted with
shouts Qf approval throughout the
line of march.
There were about two thousand
who took part, and it was about two
miles in length. It was headed by
a uniformed Klansman on a white
horse, closely followed by «. forty
piece band that played stirring mar
tial airs continuously. Then came
seemingly endless streams of Klans
men in full regalia. There were
about three hundred women also in
regalia who took part.
Three speakers addresed the
meeting at the polo grounds and
were received with cheers and ap
plause throughout.

With a blaze of glory and amid

with a Grand Dragon and his Grand

properly installed.
Delegates to the number of more

every Klan in the state, and with the
harmonious spirit pervading the
meeting, the additon of many thou

with confidence.
Cherokee Klan No. 9, Orlando, en

Lancaster, Pa.—Fully 1,000 candi

Klansmen from many sections of the
country were present. Ten thousand
persons witnessed the initiation.
That the Klan movement is the
great “Reformation of the century”
was emphasized by one of the speak
el's of the evening, who stated:
“God made the white man white
and the black man black. What God
has divided shall not be imited save
over the dead body of the last mem
ber of the Ku Klux Klan. The only
symbols of the Klan are the Cross
and the American Flag. What these
stand for, the Klan stands for.”
A Protestant minister, addressing
the Klansmen, said:
“The Catholics, the Jews and the
Negroes, individually need not fear
the Klan, but the Klan wants Amer
ica for native-born white Americans
owing no allegiance to any foreign
sect, creed or ruler.”
