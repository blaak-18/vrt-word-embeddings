Called to Order at Noon Thursday
by Mr. Frye.
SENATORS SWORN IN.
Twenty-Six of Them Enter on Their
Term of Six Years, Among Them]
Being the Much Discussed
Smoot of Utah.
Washington, March 6.-The United
States senate at noon Thursday met
in special session called by the pres
ident It was an interesting event, as
such sessions do not usually occur ex
cept when a ;president of the United
States is inductld into office, at the be
ginning of each new congress, and this
was the first session of the senate ot
the Fifty-eighth congress. The oath
was administered to twenty-six sena
tors, who take office for six years.
The senate being a continuous body
its officers hold until their successors
are chosen, so promptly at noon the
body was called to order by President
pro ten: Frye. The scene was a bril
liant one and not unlike the opening
of every session of congress. The gal
leries were filled at an early hour and
in the family and reserved galleries
were friends and relatives of the new
senators. The desks of the new sen
ators could be distinguished by the
wealth of flowers which had been pro
vided. The lavishness of the admirers
was shown by the fact that desks and
even chairs in some instances were
completely buried under huge floral
pieces and beautiful .boquets.
After the invocation Mr. Bennett,
the secretary of the senate, read the
proclamation of the president conven
ing the senate in extra session.
The namries of the newly elected sen
ators were called alphabetically, and
each was escorted to the desk by his
colleague. As soon as the names were
called there was applause in the gal
leries. That given to Mr. Gorman was
especially noticeable.
It sla the custom, to rebuke appause in
the galleries, but Mr. Frye, the presi
dent pro tem, overlooked the demon
stration.
"The chair," said he, "is especially
lenient to the galleries this morning,"
atd then he received a round of ap
plause.
Messrs. Spooner and Allison receiv
ed generous applause as they were es
corted to the desk.
Mr. Smoot of Utah subscribed to the
oath with an emphatic "I do." No ob
jection was made to his taking the
oath.

Takes His Own Life.
Henderson, Ky., March 6.-Allen
Melton, a well-to-do farmer, who Wed
nesday night fatally wounded his step
daughter and shot Mrs. John Culver,
committed suicide Thursday in a
barn when he found the building sur
rounded by bloodhounds which had
been sent in pursuit of him. Melton
Wednesday night went to the home of
John Culver, where his step-daughter.
Mary Melton, sixteen years old, was
spending the night. Culver was away
from the house. Melton entered and,
seeing his step-daughter, drew a re
volver and fired two shots at her. Mrs.
Culver ran into the room and Melton
fired, the ball passing through her
lungs. He went to home of Dr. Lat
ta, two miles away, where he remained
all night. Early Thursday morning he
went home and Morganfield's blood
hounds trailed him to a barn When
he heard them coming he swallowed a
large amount of paris green and then
shot himself through the head, falling
dead. Two weeks ago, it is said, he
tried to hang his divorced wife, and
it is helieved he r ,urned to Union to

St. Louis, March 6.-The Wabash
strike situation is resolving itself into
a legal battle for dissolution of in
Junction granted by Judge Adams. At
torneys for the firemen and trainmen
are still at work on affidavits to be
filed in the court showing why the
injunction should not be made perma
nent. The possibility of the firemen
and trainmen of the Wabash striking
as individuals without waiting for the
word from their leaders is now being
discussed. It is s'ated that men are
ready to go out at a moment's notice.
Unless President Ramsey yields it
is further declared that engincert,
conductors, telegraphers, brakemen
and trackmen to the number of 50.000
may become involved in the struggle.
Rumors of secret compact between the
men and leaders to go out even if the
dissolution of Judge Adams' injunction
is not granted, are abundant.
ON GUARD.
Strikers Are Re1ported to Have Attacked
Non-UUnioi, Men.
Colorado Springs, Colo., March 6.
The military are still on guard at the
mills and there has been a clash with
strikers. The city appointed a com
mittee of four to 'meet with General
4Ynager MacNeil of the United States
Reduction company, but MacNeill re
fused to recognize the Smeltersmen's
union, stating the strike would find its
own solution. MacNeil also refused
to meet with representatives of the
Western Federation of Miners. Under
protection of troops the Standard mill
is working. Brigadier General Chase
sent a Gatling gun section and infan
try men to tell Uride, upon receipt of
an affidavit, that attack had been
made by strikers' orders to oust em
ployees and gain possession of the
property.
PLACES FILLED.
Two Important Appointmeints for the De
partment of Justice.
Washington, March 6.-Two impor
tant appointments in the department
of justice were agreed upon by Presi
dent Roosevelt and Attorney General
Knox. William A. Day of the District I
of Columbia is made to be assistant
attorney to the attorney general at a
salary of $7000 a year and Milton D.
Purdy of Minnesota is to be assistant
attorney general. Mr. Day has been
for a long time attorney for the inter
state commerce commission and Mr.
Purdy is a prominent lawyer of St.
Paul. He was formerly assistant Unit
ed States district attorney of Minne
sota. These places were created by
a recent act of congress.
Gaming at Monte Carlo.
Sir Hiram Maxim has been investi
gating Monte Carlo. Quoting the words
of M. Blanc, the organizer of the bank,
"rouge gague quelque-fois, noir sou
vent,' mais blanc toujours," he says that
in the long run the best of systems can
do little more than reduce the loss
which is eventually inevitable owing to
the heavy percentage in favor of the
bank. The official guidebooks of Mon
te Carlo represent the average relations
between the bank and the player as
about sixty-one to sixty and that the
annual winnings of the bank are about
$5,000,000. This would indicate that
about $185,000.000 was taken to the
bank every year and $180,000,000 won
back from the bank. Sir Hiram was
naturally staggered by the magnitude
of these figures and looked into the
matter. He concluded that the amount
staked each year was about $5,500,000 !
and that the bank, instead of winning
the guidebook's 1Â½ per cent, kept about
90 per cent of the money. In other
words, the chances against the player
coming out even are about ten to one.
Venezuela.
Venezuela has a larger area than the
combined areas of the great states of
Texas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma and
Arkansas. In figures its area amounts
to about 590,000 square miles. SThe
populationr is 500,000 less than that of
Massachusetts. In 1891 it was 2,323,
527. The capital, Caracas, has 75,000
inhabitants, Maracaibo 35,000, La
Guayra 15,000 and Barcelona about 13,
000. About one person out of every
hundred is pure white, while the oth
ers are descendants of black slaves,
mulattoes, etc., and Indians.
The tepublic has three zones - hot,
temperate a"d cool-according to the
elevatioi of the land. The lowlands in
the northwest are very torrid. Here
great quantities of coffee and cacao are
raised, which form the largest agricul
tural exports of the country. The ch
cao is sent mainly to France, Germany
and Spain and the coffee, which aver
ages a yearly crop of 55,000 tons, to the
United States.- National Geographic

Would Not Sell a Napoleonic Relic.
Mme. Napoleon Ney, widow of the
late Napoleon Ney, who was one of the
committee of Frenchmen sent to the
United States to present the statue of
liberty to the sister republic, has been
offered a fabulous sum for a unique
_Ney-Napoleonic relic.
It is the official document lssued by
the second republic rehabilitating the
memory of the great Marshal Ney. He
was the grandfather of Mine. Ne.'s
husband.
Marshal Ney was shot after the bat
tle of Waterloo, when the English and
Prusslans held Paris and brought back
Loeus XVIII.
He was shot because Laus sent him
out to capture Napoleon when return
Ing from Elba, and Instead of trylng to
captare he embraced his old leader.

Their home is one of the 'lrg'st and

humanity, suffers occasionally from the
vagaries of parlor maids. Not long ago
it was decided that his library shelves
should be thoroughly dusted. Accord
ingly the books were carefully removed.
Now, Mr. Bangs had a grandfather
who wrote quite as voluminously as
himself, though upon a rather more re
ligious range of subjects. All these pi
ous volumes had been carefully and re
spectfully segregated. Mr. Bangs sup
posed they always would be.
But he had failed to reckon with the
agency of the parlor maid. When he
next entered his library, he was pained
to observe his grandfather's volume of
"Letters on Sanctification" standing
shoulder to shoulder with his own
"Houseboat on the Styx."
Mr. Bangs is said to have murmured,
"And the sins of the children shall be
visited upon the fathers." *
Miss Beatrice Harraden in a recent
interview makes some rather interest
ing revelations of her methods of work.
She could not, she says, write with oth
er people around her, so she retires in
the morning to a studio standing in a
delightful old garden. Here she com
poses her story. Two hours of steady
labor is all she requires of herself at
one sitting. She recognizes that some
may consider she escapes rather easily,
but she says she has a way of thihking
out her stories beforehand, so that the
actual writing is done very swiftly,
without hesitation, and at the end of
the two hours she has produced a con
siderable quantity of work. She points
out also that with all her facility she
has not been prolific and speaks of hav
ing spent five years on one book.
