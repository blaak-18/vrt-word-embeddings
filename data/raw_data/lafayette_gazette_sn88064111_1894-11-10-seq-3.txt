well pleased with his present home. 1
The Republicans have the sub- d
lime cheek to claim that the first, s
second and third districts have been a
carried by them. They are bank- a
ing on the House to count their ti
men in.
Hon. O. Cade returned Wednes- P
day to resume his official duties as
superintendent of the New Orleans
Mint, satisfied with the result of the
election in his (Lafayette) parish. tl
Mr. Cade is very popular with the a
people of this parish, and is ever a
ready to work for the success of the tI
Democracy and his earnest efforts
in behalf of the party were instru- ,
mental in achieving the brilliant ii
victory of last Tuesday.

Southern Pacific Time Tables.
The Southern Pacific Co. will l
issue in a few weeks, the first num
ber of their new publication entitled
"Official Time-tables, of the South
ern Pacific, Atlantic System." This
book will embrace the local time
tables of each division of the road
and of all connecting lines and will
be of value to the traveler. Em
bodied in the publication will be a
description of the towns on the road,
the commercial Importance, busi
ness interests, points of interest to
the traveler and to the settler. A
birdseye view of the city or a view
of the principal business street, a
write up of the advantages each
place possesses and a classified t
business directory of the merchants
in each city on the line of the road. i
As an advertising medium for the I
merchants this work will especially
commend itself and will show to
other places what' we have in our
own city. It will be interesting to
the prospective settler and will show
the progress we have made in our
business enterprises. Mr. J. E.
McDonald, an experienced news
paper man, has this work in charge
for the Southern Pacific Co. and
will be here in a few days and we
trust that our merchants will give I
him such encouragement as this
publication merits.
Emerson's Religion.
There was a time when New
England orthodoxy was inclined to
scant the idea of Emerson having a c
religion, and the term pagan was
heard, but that day is happily pass- a
ed and both Europe and America t
acknowlege that Emerson was the
greatest spiritual teacher America 1
has ever had. In the November s
Arena, the Rev. WV. H. Savage I
discusses "The Religion of En-er- e
son," and quotes from his poems a
and essays some of the most salient
and profoundly religious of his ut
terances concerning the soul and im
mortality and the divine spirit of
the universe. Thoughtful religious v
people will read this paper with the 5
highest sort of pleasure.
It MLay Do as Much for You. t
Mr. Fred Miller, of Irving, Ill. writes
that he had a Severe Kidney trouble for
many years, with severe pains in his back
and also that his bladder was affected. He
tried many so called Kidney cures but with
out any good result. About a year ago hef
began use of Electric Bitters and found re
lief at once. Electric Bitters is especially
adapted to cure of all Kidney and Liver
troubles and often gives almost instant re
lief. One trial will prove our statement.

So even royalty has its maritala
tiffs. There is a pathetic tinge to
the life-story of the young Empress
of China, who has just committed
suicide because her liege lord and
master slapped her face. She had
been married five years, although t
but x8 years of age, and her life ,
had been one succession of alterca
tions. Both she and the emperor
were the victims of a match-mak. i
ing mother, who forced her son to t
forsake the beautiful damsel whom
he loved and marry his cousin, .
whose plainness of feature, even
froni the Chinese standpoint, was
her claim to distinction. Unhap- "
piness followed, as was but natural, c
and when the emperor's temper, r
never good at best and much tried
.by the deserters of his army, ob
-tained the mistery of him, and s
there ~lke a scullion than a prince,
he .rer~ted to violence, his young t
spO~ kireuge in poison. One

The State commander writes us from iAe-i
coln, Neb., as follows:t "After trying cifier
l medicines for what seemed to hte a very obs
tinate cough iis our two children we tried Dr.
King's New Discovery and at the end of two
days the cough entirely left them. We will
not be without it hereafter, as our experience
proves that it cures where all other remedies
I fail."--Signed F. W. Stevens, State Com.

A Few Facts.
There are zo,ooo more women
than men in the District of Colum
bia.
War news by cable from China
costs the English papers $z.87 a
word, and from Japan $2.6o.
Napoleon's campaigns made
1,ooo,ooo French women widows
and 3,000,000 children fatherless.
In June of the present year x6, ooo
ooo children were found to be en
rolled in the schools of the United
States.
Mohammedan widows find it dif
ficult to remarry. An association
to help them in finding husbands
has been organized in Turkey.
A cubic feet of average newly
fallen snow weighs five and a half
pounds, and has twelve times the
bulk of an equal weight of water.
Authorities say that a fatal fall
from a very great hight is absolute
ly painless. The minc acts very
rapidly for a time, then uncon
cioussness ensues.
The most valuable clock known
is one made by the hands of Louis
XIV of France. It is now owned
by a member of the Rotschild fami
ly, who bought it for $ 8, ooo.
Three tenths of the earnings of a
Belgian convict are given to him on
the expiration of his term of irnpri
sonment. Some of them thus save
more money in jail than they ever
saved before.

Wonmen in the Campaign.
Memph'is Commercial Appeal.
The campaign just closing will
be memorable because of the ac
tive participation of women in poli
tics. The extension of woman suf
frage in so many states during the
last few years has given to woman's
vote a potentiality which party
managers in the future will not be
able to ignore, and when the re
turns of Tuesday's election shall be
known, the reviewer will find it in
teresting to consider just how much
woman was able to effect. Not
only will her vote de of importance
in Colorado, Kansas, Illinois and
other States, but her influence will
be felt in States where the privi
lege of voting is withheld from her.
In New York her power has been
invoked by Dr. Parkhurst, who
has even gone to the extent of or
ganizing the negro women of that
city. It has been really the first
campaign, except in Kansas, that
woman has appeared formidably,
and we expect hereafter she will en
ter in politics more and more ag
gressively every year. It is no
longer a question as to whether she
should be accorded the ballot. It
is merely a question when she will
enjoy all the privileges of the fran
chise now held by the opposite sex.
This is one of the cold facts that
the end of the century has brought.
The present condition is absurd
women voting in one State and de
prived of the ballot in another.
Such a condition can not be main
tained. Either women who have
gained the ballot must relinquish it,
or all women must have. WVe are
not considering whether she ought
to vote, but the facts as they con
front us. If the Colorado women
vote in such large numbers as to
manifestly affect the result, we may
be sure that the leaders of the wom
en suffrage elsewhere will besiege
the State Legislatures and Congress
to follow the example of Colorado
and invest the women with right of
suffrage everywhere and on all oc
casions. The movement has sur
vived the stage of ridicule, and the
reformers are no longer to be lightly
treated. The have already able
champions in the United States
Senate, and we will not be surprised
if in the course of the next two or
three years the time of Congress
will be largely consumed in discus
sions of the woman's suffrage ques
tion. What gives force to this
view is the endowment on the part
of so many of the States. As the
waves comes from that direction,
it will have great power when it
strikes the reef of congressional
prejudice. The point of initia
tive is alwaysof first importance in
American politics. Any enterprise
or reform that acquires a standing
in the counties, districts or states
rarely lacks earnest advocacy in the
ighcr councils of the natidn, and

Morality in Politics.
Miss Cathering H-I. Spence, the
Australian lady who made such a big
hit at the World's Fair Congress witl
her lectures on Proportional Rel:re
sentation, and repeated it in all the
leading cities of the union aiterword
contributes a striking and valuable
paper to the November Arena called
"Effective Voting the only Eriec
tive Moraliver of Policies." -Miss
Spence has a clear and j:ulical
grasp of all the political problems
besetting modern democracy and
this paper is a clear and convincing
exposition of the moral beneitis to
be reaped from proportional repre
sentation- Such literature will not
appeal strongly to the sympathies of
ward heelers, but all self-respecting
and intelliigent Americans will he in
terested in a reform that guards the
security and sanctity of the ballt
and means the downfall of the boss
and the tough in politics.
The woman emancipationist had
tackled the serene old bachelor and
was reading the riot act to him in a
half dozen different places at once.
He squirmed occasionally, but he
retained his serenity.
"Have you ever done anything
for the emancipation of woman,
I'd like to know ?" she said, coming
down the home stretch.
"Indeed I have madam," he
smiled. "I have remained a bache
lor."
Professor Thomas I. \Vill A. M.,

against the rule of the Boss and self
respecting intelligent American citi
zens will find much that will be nee s
to them in this paper written by a
professor of political economy and
