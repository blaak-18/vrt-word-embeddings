'Ts ,another colum of this praper wi¶'l `t
tgeen tesolati4st 'dopited by the It
`,~iss` of the first and second 0
WAi!ards at a meeting held at Scott on ci
'Saturday last. These resolutions set ai
-'_o-rth that owing "tb the low prices w
oof farm products which prevail and W
'W.e poor prospects of enhancement P
'-ie- assessment for parochial and c
State taxation, although prevously d
satisfactory, should be lowered so
as to allow a reduction of taxes in
pr:portion to the general depression
. values. This to our thinking, is n
fair, and we may add, imperative,
under the present conditions. Af- a
t~er all, vahlues of land and other
''taxable property, "rise and fall" ac- tl
co'ding to the finanicial fluctuations
"of 'he houir; nd the prices of
landed estate are, ifs great measure,
if not exclusively, dependent upon
wlhat 'its fruits will yield in the
market. No one will invest in it
unless the revenues assure a reason
"able interest on the capital.
At the present time it takes two
and a half bales of cotton to realize
what one bale would have sold for
two years ago and still the same
amount of capittal and labor is re
quired to produce one bale now that d
it did then. t
The san it my be said of the
values of all things used on the farm
such as horses, mules, etc. To
day these necessities of the farm are
at least 50 per cent lower than last it
year. Indeed it would be a crying c1
injustice should the assessments be
kept at their present figures. tl
We note with pleasure that the
expenses of the parish for this year,
is appears in the report of the bud
get committee in the Police Jury ci
proceedings published in this paper,
have been reduced and are over
, two thousand dollars less than last d
year. This shows that our police cl
jurors appreciate the present condi- b,
tion of affairs and are bent upon re- al
lieving the people as much as pos
sible. We hope that when they will
sit as a board of reiviewers after
the taking of the assessment, they
will act, as is their wont, with equity
and justice. We may add, however
that we believe the Police Jury will ,
not have occasion to reduce the as
sessments as the assessor will will- A
Itng y do so. a
THE CROP QUESTIO- . r
Numerous agricultrial conven- P
tions are being held in various r,
parts of the country for the purpose
of discussing the situation and find
ing a remedy for the depression in
the prices of farm products. The c
tonclusion seems to be unanimously
reached that a panacea for all evils t
existing rests in raising less foi the
market and more for home con
sumption. Unquestionably for the
small farmer this would be the a
safest course, provided he were not S
in debt and able to furnish his sup
plies while making the crop. But
unfortunately in Louisiana there are
any number who are in debt and
unable to furnish themsel\ves.
These must have assistance, and
since the merchant will not advance
except on cotton, cane or rice, it
becomes almost an impossibility to
attempt it. Moreover large planta
tions cannot follow this method,
not only because it will not pay,
but also because being in the same
Eondition-as the petty farmers most
of them connot get the necessary
supplies. Diversified farming would
succeed were it riot that railroads
dre not plentiful enough to furnish
quick transportation and at a rea
•sonable rate. The question of the
*uture then becomes a serious one.
-It will probably result in producing
'i similar crop which will be raised
 more ecoiinidcilly, but at the ex
;p·.ense of labor which *rill necessarily
,be:forced to accept less.

TIlE BROOKL YN SRlI,2E. Tc
The Brooklyn st'ike has termi- 1
naeted, and has resulted as all strikes
have resulted-in failure. It was re
a fight on the part of the street-car di
employees for more reasonable t"
hours or more pay. on the part of a
the street-car magnates against or
ganized labor. On the one side
was a demand for justice, on the h
other capital reducing labor to its Tl
will. It was not a question of re:
money with the employers for they in;
preferred losing $55000, -.s hi. Ri
been shown positively, to yielding D.
to demands which would not in
volye one fourth the amount. At
Moreover, they chose rather to call W
the power of the State costing the tax- 11.
payers $40,000 or $50.000 for pro- J
tdction rather than to submit to the
dictation of their employers, as T
they put it. In other words, the II.
capitalists take refuge behind theI Al
principle that a man has the right At
to pay what he chooses and it rests ).
with the laborer to take it or leave
it. The strikers, on the other h;an :
claim that a clay's work should be PL
paid for in value. In one respect $3
the capitalists were right; but since
conditions are such that labor now Ju
can not "leave it," but must accept
what the employer offers, it be
comes necessary that labor make!
some effort to secure full value for Dr
its work, since justice no longer cc
dictates the course of the employer c
class. The strikers acted upon that g,
basis; they had the synrlpathy of f
all good men; but synipathy does
not avail much before the bayonets
of the State. P1t

The Tlopi Of The : !our i.
Within the pa.t ye'ar, an I ex
pecially within the last six tai.t!;s,
finance has taken, as a topic of
press discus.sion, the place occýiii ei ,
for several years past by the tu:r.'i.
Contradictory amnd irrec.-: i.b.,: as
are th:e positivlns, coinpile.< an ctnc, -
fused as are the arguumentit, of t.ht
political parties and le.::lcr.; of ti.e
country upon the tariff qu:-I:;in.
thl:ey.are no less so upon te (l:u -
tion of finance. The great 1.,,iiti
cal problem of the day in the
United States is the problem of re
forming the National currency.
The man or woman who pretends to
be well informed will not be con
tent to learn the views of a few
newspapers only upon the foiancial
and other questions of the hour,
but will seek in some way to get a
survey of the press discussion in
all parts of the country and upon
all sides of the question at issue.
There is no way to get such a shit
vey except by reading a journal1
that gives extracts and condensed
statements from all the leading rep
resentative papers and reviews.
Such a journal is P'uLt.Ic Otis tS ,
published weekly at Wiashington, )D.
C. In its particular field it is
unique and unrivaletd. It covers
the entire range of current news and
comnment, political, sociological,
financial, scientific, religious, liter
ary, both American and .foreign.
In connection with the American
Institute of Civics it has inaug
urated an exceedingly helpful plan
Ifor the stud) of current topics. (A
