WS'iE HIGH SCHOOL.
Now that the High School build
ing has been completed, and a suffi
cient amount of money appropriated
by the police jury and the city
council to furnish all necessary fur
niture and school apparatus, the ur
gent importance of setting the insti
tution into practical operation be
comes a matter of most absorbing
interest to the entire community.
After three years of long,
and at times seemingly hope
less delay, the consummation of
a most worthy and laudable enter
prise now appears almost in actual
realization. The city council and
and police jury have vied with each
other in fostering and promoting
the establishment of this institution,
and the general public, through pri
vate subscriptions and public enter
tainments, have contributed a hand
some quota toward the erection of
the building and purchase of the
grounds.
Just at present the question
of a permanent revenue, for the
maintenance of the school, is being
considered, and from all indications
the well known liberality of the city
council and police jury, supple
mented by the commendable zeal
of the president of the school board
and his worthy coadjutors, the solu
tion of this very essential factor in
the administration of the school
should present few, if any, difficul
ties. It is a matter of the highest
importance. The revenue ought,
and will be forthcoming.
The people of Lafayette have too
long deprived themselves of educa
tional facilities, and have allowed
adjoining communities, less favora
bly situated, to outstrip them by far
in all that pertains to progress, ad
vancement and general public en
lightenment. The educational ad
vantages of any place is a fair crite
rion of its intelligence, and the lack
of a few paltry dollars should not
certainly be permitted to foil the ef
forts now being made toward raising
a sufficient revenue to run the High
School.
But along with this question of
revenue and incidental thereto,there I
has, also, arisen another and alto
gether unfortunate and inopportune
question as to the administration of
the school; plainly speaking, "Who
shall run the High School ?" While
no formal consideration, has been
given this question, yet as a matter
of fact, it has elicited much and va
ried discussion. The proposition
has been advanced that the admin
istration of the school be committed
to a local board consisting of three
members from the city council,three
members from the police jury, three
from the school board and three
from the Lafayette White High
School Association. This scheme
is as unfortunate and inopportune
as it is impracticable under existing
conditions. The charter of the La
fayette High School Association,
having in charge the property, most
positively and distinctly settles the
question of administration, in the
following language: "The present
Board of Directors of this corpora
tion, and their successors in office,
are requested, and they are fully
authorized and empowered, to as
sign, transfer, and turn over, the
gratuitous use of said school house
with all furnitures and appurte
nances belonging to this corpora
tion to the School Board of the par
ish of Lafayette, on condition that
said School Board shall open, and
keep open, a public school in said
hourr etc, etc. And if the school
board does not furnish the necessary
instruction, as above required, the
use of the property to be transfered
to it shall revert and return to the
control and management of the La
fayette White High School," (asso
ciation). Thus it will readily ap
pear that so soon as the use of the
property is transfered to the public
school authorities, it is then subject
to the administration of that body.
There can be no evasion on this
* point, and the argument that repre
sentation follows, where support
has been contributed and services
d. yendered, lacks application, for
tever funds have been contri
Ipated out of the public treasuries of
h l*re town and parish, emin4lid from
he people, who are fullyihid ably
by the par" school
d Why should nA 'the. sCe
apply to-private subserip
;-~ .-..
tions :s moinoneys raised by means i
of public entertainments ? Are not d
the Black Diamonds, the Little I
Diamonds, and Ye Old Folks, etc., c
entitled to * representation ? So the c
thing would go on ad injlnitum. s
"Too many cooks will spoil the t
broth" is a very homely, but truth- t
ful adage, and applies with peculiar
force to the question now at issue. r
The parish school board is vested c
with entire control of all public r
schools within the parish, and has r
no authority to delegate its powers s
to any person or association of per- t
sons, even were the necessity of c
such actio~qo be considered a mo- c
ment. 1
It, therefore, follows very conclu- i
sively that if the High School is to c
be a public institution, it must be t
placed under the exclusive contro 1
and management of the parish t
school board. The board is fully
competent, and through its presi- 1
dent is already negotiating for the
services of an able professor to take
charge of the school. Divest this
entire matter of all personal or poli
tical considerations, and the solu-t
tion, of any conflicting interest, t
will vanish as the mist. Let there
be harmony and unity of purpose s
in this most vital enterprise, and itsf
success will be assured.
IN A DORMANT STAGE.
There appears to be but little talk
in regard to the filling of a vacancy,
in the lower hous-,from this parish, a
occasioned by the appointment of t
Mr. Overton Cade to the superin
tendency of the mint in New
Orleans.
Likely this silence is the ominous
precursor of the storm. Indeed, the]
calm is so intense that not a whisper
disturbs the ear. But, then, there
is ample time to prepare for the I
fray.
We said not a whisper is heard
we mean at the present moment. It
is true that a name or two has es
caped some partisan or warm per
sonal friend, but these names, it is
difficult to ascertain, if they have
caused any but the sligest ripple
on the unusually placid surface.
That more than one nag is being
quietly groomed, is within the
bounds of reasonable deductions,
so that when the time comes they
will be enterred with a great flourish
of trumpets, to create enthusiasm
and engender confidence in their
sure winning. But, as Burns has it,
"the best laid plans of men and
mice aft gang ablee," and it is cer
tain to so result in more instances
than one.
Some time since, our valued cor
respondent Cherokee, in replying
to another of The Gazette's valued
correspondent's query regarding the
quietness about this matter, intimat
ed that the future representative of
this parish is selected, and that the
only thing remaining was the form
ality of declaring him elected, be
cause the votes would so determine.
We do not agree with our friend,
and he will forgive us if we think he
is just a little previous in his con
clusions. We do not think that a
single person has been seriously
talked off-this with all due defer
ence to our good friend "Totidem
Verbis" who, some time since, sug
gested one surmised to be Mr. C. C.
Brown, as a most suitable person.
We are not taking issue with him in
regard to the gentleman's qualifica
tions, on the contrary we cheerfully
acquiesce in his views.
However, the time must come
when every aspirant's forces must
be marshalled to the front. That
there is much good timber to select
from is conceded. This election
will be of momentous importance, K
in view of the fact that a United
States senator will be elected at the K
incoming session of the legislature,
and the report or suggestions of the
Constitutional committee will also
be submitted to that body for ac
tion. Hence, it behooves the peo
ple to be careful in their choice.
The Gazette has no favorite, and
will be content with the man fairly
selected by white primaries, held
under tne auspices of the Democra
tic Parish Executive Committee.
With us it is a matter of vital im
portance to preserve and keep intact
the party organization. Within the
party there is abundance of splendid
material from which to select a re
presentative, in whose hands the
interests of the people can be safely
entrusted.
T7FE FARMEfRS.
- Through a regrettable oversight
The Gazette omitted the publica
tion last Saturday of the call of the
Farmer's Alliance quarterly parish
meeting, to be held this day at Mr.
Ben Avant's place, this day.
The Gazette is pleased to see the
farmers of this parish evincing such,
interest.in an order that can be pro
ductive, to them, of much good.
Any one at all familiar with their
constitution cannot but approve its
declarations, and wish them god- I
speed in thgir worthy efforts for fra- 1
ternal good will between,and protec
tion to, its members.
The order at one time had a large
membership in this parish, but
owing probably to the stringency in
money matters lately experienced,
many have allowed their member
ship to lapse. No doubt now that
the dark financial clouds are fast
disappearing and better times are
coming, many of those who had
left' the ranks will rejoin. For with
in the scope of its organization it
can effect much good for the farm
er, because, first of all, in unity of
purpose more can be accomplished
than by battling singly.
The Gazette hopes the meeting
will be fruitful of the best results.

the good fortune of meeting several prom

hope that their every effort will be crowned
with success. We also saw a few of the

We beg to call attention to the
fact that we have commenced mill
ing for the new season. Planters
who propose shipping rough rice
to be milled on toll-will do well to
write us as to the .amount they are
likely to ship and the probable date
of shipment. This will enable us to
place same on our mill roster and
by the turn being thus engaged, im
mediate attention secured as soon
as the rough is received.
Holders of old crop will do well
to send it right along before the new
crop makes it "take a back seat."
Do not mix the old and new to
gether as they mill differently and
they both suffer.
Care should be taken to pack in
good strong bags, also to mark
plainly that lots may not get m.xed
