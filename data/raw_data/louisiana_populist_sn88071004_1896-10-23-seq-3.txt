Democratic Apathy.
The Caucasian seems to be some
what exercised over the fact that
the democrats are unconcerned
about the ele..tion of their candi
date in the fourth district. That
this state of afthirs exists is evident
to the most casual observer. The
cause of this unfortunate condition
can be traced to several sources,
but the principle and most vital
one can be centered directly upon
our Congressional Executive Com
nuttee. Il the last vote on the
question of party nominations the
people declared overwhelmingly
for white democratic primaries.
At the very next meeting of the
Ccngressional Executive Commit
tee there after it gives us a conven
tion. By this arbitrary action on
the part of this Committee, the will
of the white democrats of the 4th
congressional district has been
over-ridden and mercilessly trol
den under the unhallowed feet of
party leaders. In view of this
high handed procedure on the part
of the Executive committee, it is
not marvelous that there is apathy
discontent and lack of harmony
within the party, After all, the
i)eople are to be blamed for the sit
nation; why did they not rise in
their indignation and demand that
these men carry out their wishes
or else kick them into the gulf of
Mexico.-DExMoCm T, in Ooashat
ta Citizen,
They did rise, friendly Democrat,
but the ballot-boxes of Bossier
rose higher. Mr. Ogden has nev
er won a contest for the nomination
in this district fairly. We person
ally know fraud in each of the
three.
While the honest Democrats are
purifying their party in this fight,
let them vote against this fraud,

and pure man in the person of B,

Address Issued By The Natleal
Executive V mmittee Of The
People'. Party.
To the People's Party Voters Of
The United States:
Your NationalCommittee indal
ged the hope that the patriotic ac
tion of the People's party in Na
tional Convention, in subordinat
ing the interests of party to the
success of the vital issues involved
in this campaign would be met by
equally unselfish devotion to a
common interest on the part of the
Democratic party, and that all of
the friends of silver could present
a solid front against the minions of
greed by supporting one ticket,
the truly co-operative ticket, Bry
an and Watson. But this hope
being disappointed, there were but
two courses left, one of which
must be adopted.
First. To run a straight Bryan
and Watson electoral ticket in
every State, which, on account of
the failure of the Democratic par
ty to support this ticket, would
have effected the same result in
this campaign that would have fol
lowed the nomination of a straight
Populist ticket at St. Louis, name
ly, the election of McKinley and
the triumph of the gold standard.
It is true that the Democratic
party would be responsible even
to a greater extent than ourselves
for such a result, but to permit
evil totriumph on such groomds
would convict us as well as them
of a lack of patriotism and narrow
partisnashnp that would deserve
the forfeit to us of the confdence
of the Ameriean people. Remem
ber that two wrongso never make a
right.
When our devotion to the wel
fare of the people falters beausome
of anyfailureon thi part of the
Demoeratic or any' other party,
thbea lmadeed will we have lowered
ourm standard and provem ourmselves
e to oaur own teachings and re
psdiated our own motto of country
rst, and me. and p-rtie seaond.m
The bfave, ealightmdal voters who
Popl's party are e m sbe ot
suoch base betrayal of their country
as wold result from a divialom in
thb rank of those opposing the'
mahinations of the conbdlrated
anmey power of the two cohtinests
spint the homes sd liberties aof
tbhe Amrlen peoplh, uad would
repdiat ma miaeom the ipart
their aders opposaed to alted e.
e odp tie r treachery to'
TO UNITE AOAIN8T MCKINLEY.
The other course left open to
your committee that was consis
tent with the action of the Conven
i. tion in nominating Mr. Bryan
it was to do everything in its power
It to unite the voters of the country
r against McKinley and to overcome
, the obstacles and embarrassments
iI which, if the Democratic party had
put the cause first and party sec
e ond, we would not have encounter
e ed.
y This could be accomplished only
* by arranging for a division of the
electoral vote in every state possi
ble, securing so many electors for
n Bryan and Watson and conceding
II so many to Bryan and Sewall.
At the opening of the campaign
I. this, under the circumstonces,
)f seemed the wisest course for your
* Committee, and it is clearer to-day
than ever that it was the only safe
y and wise course if our votes were
y to be cast and made effective tor
the relief of an oppressed and out
raged people. Following this line
rt of policy your Committee has ar
4 ranged electoral tickets in three
f fourths of the states, and will do
all in its power to make the same
. arrangement in all the States.
r By perfecting tris arrangement
r. and every sincere opponent of the
a gold standard giving loyal suppart
i- te these joint electoral tickets, the
,e People's party will not only secure
in the electoral college for Bryan
e and Watson several times as many
t, votes as we could have possibly
1, secured by making a straight fight,
e but will secure the defeat of Mc
l' Kinlev and the gold standard,
which should now be the greatest
desire of every citizen who believes
in the principles of true democra
cy as taught by Jefferson. and of
true republicanism as represented
f by Abraham Lincoln.
THE DIVIDE AND CONQUER POLICY.
By this arrangement we can un
ite a large majority of the voters of
America on our joint electoral tick
- ets, therefore, the only hope of the
- money power and trusts is to dr
e vide and conquer. The Republi
I can managers and their gold Dem
p ocratic allies realize this, and are
a putting forth every effort to ac
s complish this end. They have had
f their emissaries on hand every
t where trying to prevent joint elec
t toral tickets from being arranged
--failing in this they try to find
- populists and silver demnprats who
3 can be induced on one pretext or
t another, to rebel against the joint
a electoral tickets. They either have
secured, or will secure, the servi
I ces of every man that money can
I command to breed dissensions and
f divisions.
The danger lies in the possibili
ty of a certain portion of the rank
and file of the People's party being
misled by so-called leaders, who
for reasons best known to them
selves, or for want of a reason, are
advising voters to rebel against
the joint electoral tickets and put
up seperate electoral tickets, or to
with-hold their support from the
Ijoint electoral tickets.
ocRATs or O TH REVEnrE
Some of the Democrats of the
Revenue stripe who are not yet
weaned from the leshpots of
Egypt, but are sticklers for regu
larity, and are nominally support
ing Mr. Bryan, while secretely and
in every underhand way are trying
to accomplish his defeat, are advis
ing against the joint electoral tick
ets, and, failing in this, they advise
Democrats to scratch People's par
ty electors, and already a few so
called Populist leaders are advising
the rank and fileof our party to
strike back by refusing to support
the Democratic electors on the
joint deleetoral tickets. This is a
trap set by the goldbugs, who are
rejoielg that a few honest men
have fallen into it. These reports
today are the only ones that buoy
up tbe hopes of the Republican
managers, and the Democrats an
Popunlit who are thus engaged
are doing jiut what the gold men
mt desire. Therefore, we ap
pal to every Populist who may
have been raded by such mistaken
or false pleu of pretended loyalty
to the People's party into refuaing
su)port to such joint electoral tick
ets to stop and consider the results
of swch conduct and refuse to he
influenced by eithelr misguitled or
corrupt Iien.
r BUT TWO SIDES TO TII C'ONFLITr.
r There are but two sides in the
, conflict that is being waged in this
, country to-day. On the one side
I are the allied hosts of Monopolies,
- the money power, great trusts and
railway corporations, who seek the
enactment of laws to benefit them
and impoverish the people. On
a the other side are the farmers, the
- laborers, merchants, and all others
r whoeproduce wealth and bear the
b hurden of taxation. The one rep
resents the wealthy and powerful
o classes who want the control of
the government to plunder the
r people. The other represents the
P people contending for equality be
B fore the law and the rights of man.
Between these two there is no
r middle ground.
The one and only hope of the
a Republican party to win in this
campaign andl fasten the gold stan
- dard upon the country is the cor
3 rupt use of an unlimited supply of
3 money for bribery, corruption,
and intimidation. The patriotic
action of the People's party in
forming and supporting these joint
electoral tickets has shattered that
hope. Already they are alarmed
at the impotency of a boodle cam
paign, when all of the great moral
forces of the people are solidly uni.
ted in defence of American institu
tions. The revulsion of the Amer
ican people against this boodle
campaign during the last ten days
L has so united them that victory is
now assured.
OPPORTUNITY OF PEOPLE'S PARTY,
I The People's party made this
revolution possible. Let every
one do his duty and fail not. Let
our boast be that we are American
citizens, and that American citi
zens are more than partisans.
This done, the cohorts of domes
tic and foreign greed will be driv
en from our legislative councils
and the dominations of American
institutions; this done, and the be
trayed Republic will be redeemed
and American prosperity restored.
the men and the party that achieve
such grand and patriotic results in
this crisis will be the men and the
party of the future. ' It has been
left for the People's party and the
silver Republicans to make the
party sacrifice and to do the patri
otic work necessary to accomplish
this result.
The People's party must do it,
for no other party will. The Peo
ple's party will do it. Therefore,
the People's party will be the party
of the future. The American peo
ple will recognize it as the agency
that saved the day when their in
terests were at stake; the Ameri
can people will rally around its
banner as the party to contend
against the enemy of good govern -
ment in the future. Every man to
his post and the victory is won.
