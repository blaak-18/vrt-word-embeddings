the public, it was changed to a fortnight.
ly. Still 6ontinuing its good work of
hitting folly as it dies, and showing up
the political and social shams by its
mUasterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater success than
before, and was recognized as tht ablest
and brightest of its clans. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly I It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be

unapproachable. At least one first-elass
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.

Dr. J Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
"What is the cause of the unpar
alleled su;ccess of VINEGAR BIT
TERS I" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never befGre in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of Viz
soAs Burrras in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of DR. WAt- "
ER's Vi:soAa -irres are Aperient, Dia

treatment, a purgative, exerting a

Sarsaparilla
Is widely known
as one of the most
effectual rmine
dies ever discov.
ered for cleans
ing the system
and purifying the
blood. It has
Sstoo(l the test of
years, wiIh a con
stantly growing,
reputation, based on its intriusie virtues,
and sustained by its remarkable curel.
So mild as to be safe and beneficial to
children, and yet so searching as to
effectually purge out the great corrup
tions of lie blood, such as the scrof
ulolu and syphilitic contamination.
Impurities or diseases that have lurked
in the system for years soon yield to
this powerful autidote, and disappear.
Hence its wonderfid cures, mansy of
which are publicly known, of Scrofila,
and all scrofulous diseases, Ulcers,
Eruption% and eruptive disorders of
the skin, Tumors, Blotches, Balis,
Pimnples, Pustules, Sores, St.
Anthony's Fire, Rose or Ery
sipelas Teotter, Salt 4lhcuva,
Scald Heand, Ringworm. and in
ternal Ulcerations of the Uterus,
Stomach, and Liver. It also cures
othilier complaints, to which it would not
gseem especially adapted, such as D)rop
sy, Dyspepsia, Fits, Neuralgia,
Heart Disease, Female Weak
ness, Debility, and Leucorrhuea,
when they are manifestations of the
acrofulous poisons.
It is an excellent restorer of health
and strength in the Spring. By renew
ing the appetite and vigor of the diges
tive organs, it dissipates the depression
and listless languor of the season.
Even where no disorder appears, people
feel better, and live longer, for cleansing
the blood. The system moves on with
renewed vigor and a new lease of life.
