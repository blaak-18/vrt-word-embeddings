PAGE TWO
WRITING A SPEECH FOR PETER
By J. J. BELL
HE lamplight showed the
beads of perspiration on
the lined and weather
beaten brow of Mr. Mc-
Bean as he bent over the
kitchen table whereon lay
several sheets of ruled
foolscap. One of the
sheets was partly covered
with very large writing
in pencil. Here and there
were b 1 u r r e d patches,
where the writer had
sought to delete a word
]

by the simple process of rubbing it
bard with a moistened forefinger; in
more than one instance not only the
words but also the paper had disap
peared.
Mr. Mcßean groaned, wrote a word
laboriously, stared at it, and groaned
again.
“Marget,” he said suddenly, with
out looking at his wife who, while
pretending to knit at the fireside,
was really watching her man with
stealthy but keen interest; “Marget,
boo dae ye spell unspeakable? Is’t
ible or—able?’’
“ —able,” said Mrs. Mcßean,
promptly; then, doubtfully, “or else
it ’s —ible. What is’t ye’re wantin’
to say, Peter?”
“I’m sayin’ that it gi’es us a’ the
maist unspeakable pleasure an’ sat
isfaction to present him wi’ sich a
bewtiful an’ gorgeous bookcase, an’
that I’m sure it gi’es him the maist
unspeakable pleasure an’ satisfaction
to get it.”
“Say it again, Peter.”
Mr. Mcßean did as requested.
“If 1 was you,” remarked the old
woman, “I wud leave oot the bit
aboot the meenister’s satisfaction.”
Mr. Mcßean threw down his pen
cil.
“Is ’t you or me that’s to mak’ the
presentation?” he demanded crossly.
“Os course Peter,” she re
plied soothingly.
“Weel,” he said, his irritation giv
ing place to sheer dejection, “I wish
it was somebody else. This speech
’ll be the death o’ me. Is’t —able or
ible?”
“Dinna sash yersel’ aboot the
spellin’ o' yer speech—naebody’s
likely to see it. But pey attention
to the meanin’, for everybody’s boun’
to hear it.”
Again Mr. Mcßean groaned. Poor
man, he had been highly flattered
and gratified when first the village
chose him to make the presentation
to the minister, on the occasion of
the latter’s semi-jubilee; but as the
important date drew nearer and
nearer his self-confidence had stead
ily waned, and now misery and anx
iety claimed him for their own. The
prospect of standing up, in the
church hall, before all his neighbors,
not to mention the minister himself,
utterly appalled him. For a week he
had struggled with the composition
of a suitable speech, and had used
up at least a shilling’s worth of pa
per and a whole pencil. He now
realized that he was no further on
than at the start, while the fateful
evening was barely forty-eight hours
distant.
“Wud ye no’ tak’ a bit rest, Pe
ter?” said his wife, striving bravely
to conceal her own misery and anx
iety. “Ye’ll hurt yer brain, if —”
“Rest!” he cried bitterly. “Hoo
can I rest when the event is boomin’
sae near?” (Possibly he meant
“looming.”) “An’ as for ma brain,
it’s no’ that feeble, though it kens
mair aboot gardens nor speeches.”
“I did na’ say it was feeble. But
ye’re pittin’ an awful strain on it, an’
I’m feart ye—”
“Aweel,” he said in a dreary yet
determined voice, “the speech has
got to be made, even supposin’ ma
brain explodes on the spot.”
“Oh, whisht, man, whisht! Ye gi’e
me a grue, speakin’ like that. Read
me what ye’ve wrote, an’ then leave
it till the morn.”
After some pressing the old man
read, in a mumbling fashion, the
lines which had cost so much mental
pain.
“Ladies an’ gentlemen an’ frien’s,”
he began.
“Wud ye no’ jist ca’ them a’
frien’s?” his wife mildly suggested.
“That wud be ower fameeliar.
The gentry wudna like it, though
they’re few.”
“Weel, jist say ‘ladies an’ gentle
men.’ ”
“Tits, wife! D’ye want the neigh
bors to think I’m makin' - a mock o’
them?”
“Weel, weel; ha’e it yer ain wey,
Peter.”
“Ye dinna need to get huffy, Mar
get.”
“I’m no’ huffy. But I dinna want
ye to say the wrang thing.”
“That’s the reason I’m sayin’ ‘la
dies an’ gentlemen an’ frien’s.’ It
includes everybody.”
“Excep’ yer enemies,” she said, in
a poor attempt to be jocular.
“My! but ye’re pernickety! Is ’t
you or me that’s to mak’ the presen
tation?”
Mrs. Mcßean swallowed her nat
ural desire for the last word, sighed,
and requested her man to proceed.
About five minutes later he did so.
“Ladies an’ gentlemen an’ frien’s,
it gives me great pleasure an’ satis
faction to behold ye a’ gethered to
gether on this important occasion.”
(This was a quotation from a speech
to which Mr. Mcßean had listened
some years previously. He now
wished he had listened more atten
tively.) “As each o’ ye has had the
pleesure an’ satisfaction o’ sub
scribin’ for this bewtiful an’ gorge
ous bookcase for oor honored an’ be
loved meenister’s simmy-jubilee, ye
aare a’ aware o’ the reason for this
getherin’ an’ presentation. Ye are
dootless surprised an’ astonished to
behold sich a bewtiful an’ gorgeous
bookcase for yer money; an’ I’ve got
to explain that, if it hadna been for
Maister Drummond gi’ein’ five
pounds—five pound!—the bookcase
wud ha’e been a lot inferior. Ye a’
ken —■”
“D’ ye think ye should speak aboot
the five pound frae Maister Drum
mond, Peter?” put in Mrs. Mcßean.
“What wey should I no’ speak
aboot it?” he asked, with some as
perity.
Mrs. Mcßean found it impossible
to express her objections, and pres
ently begged him to continue.
“Ye a’ ken,” he resumed, “hoo
weel ass we are wi’ oor honored an’
beloved meenister, the Reverend
Maister Shelbrook, which has labor
ed amongst us for exactly five-an
twinty year. He cam’ to us a young
man, wi’ sma’ experience, but noo
he’s aulder an’ wiser. We’re rale
prood o’ him an’ his honored and
beloved wife an’ faymily. He pre
ferred a bookcase to a silly teapot,
et cetera, his wife’s uncle havin’ pro
vide! the same, accordin’ to his last
will an’ testament. An’ so, ladies an’
gentlemen an’ frien’s, I arise for to
say that it gives us a’ the maist un
speakable pleesure an’ satisfaction to
present him wi’ sich a bewtiful an’
gorgeous book case, an’ I ’m sure it
gi’es him the maist unspeakable
pleasure an’ satisfaction to get it.”
Mr. Mcßean paused and drew a
long breath.
“That’s a’ I ’ve got wrote,” he
said, and eyed his spouse as if wait
ing for her opinion.
It was slow in coming. Mrs. Mc-
Bean felt that all was not right with
the speech, yet for the life of her she
could not have stated definitely what
was wrong.
“Ha’e ye set yer heart on speakin’
aboot the meenister’s satisfaction?”
she ventured timidly at last. “Wud
it no’ be best to let him speak for
himsel’ aboot that, Peter?”
“What’s wrang wi’ me speakin’
about it? Is ’t no’ the truth?”
“Ou, ay, I suppose it’s the truth,
but—”
‘Ciije 'Jeffersonian
“Oh, onything to please ye. I’ll
score it oot! Is there onything else
that’s wrang?”
“Na, na. But I was wonderin’ if
he wud like ye tellin’ everybody
aboot the uncle an’ the siller teapot.
Ye see—”
“Onything else?” cried Mr. Mc-
Bean, in a voice that seemed to burst
from his chest.
“Na, na, Peter. Yer speech is rale
fine —”
“That ’s no’ the speech; it ’s mere
ly the introductionary remarks.”
Mrs. Mcßean gasped, and recover
ed herself.
“Weel, it ’s rale fine, whatever it
is. But —but d’ ye think ye need
speak aboot the meenister bein’ aul
der an’ wiser nor when he cam’ first
to the Kirk? Mind ye, I ’m no’ say
in’ there’s onything wrang—Oh, Pe
ter! ”
The exclamation was full of dis
may caused by the sight of the old
man crumpling up the paper and
flinging it into the fire.
“Oh, Peter!”
“I hope ye ’re pleased noo!” he
said, half resentful, half ashamed.
“Ye’ll maybe explain at the meetin’
on Friday that ye didna conseeder
ma speech fit to be spoke. I wash
ma han’s o’ the business. They can
get some ither body to mak’ the pre
sentation. I ’m gaun to ma bed.”
“Oh, Peter!” she sighed.
But he refused to return to the
subject.
Mr. Mcßean slept badly that night;
Mrs. Mcßean slept not at all. Fre
quently he muttered in his sleep, and
she caught such phrases as “honor
ed and beloved,” “unspeakable plees
ure _ an’ satisfaction,” “gorgeous
bookcase.” The old woman was
distressed and sore afraid. She knew
that her man would never seek the
assistance of her neighbors—not
that she desired him to do so, for she
had some pride of her own; but she
dreaded, for his sake any blundering
or break-down on the great occasion,
and still more, far more, she dread
ed the effect of the strain on his
mind. It seemed to her that he was
a different man from what he had
been a week ago; his old buoyancy
and heartiness had departed from
him, and his appetite had decreased
alarmingly. So she lay with aching
thoughts, feeling very wretched and
helpless.
In the dawn Peter arose and,
deeming her to be still asleep, dressed
himself in silence. Presently he pro
cured paper and pencil and seated
himself at the kitchen table. Now
and then a half-stifled groan escaped
him.
Later he came to the bedside, look
ing humble and hopeless.
“It ’s ower big a job for me,” he
said despairingly. “It bates me com
pletely. Can ye no’ help me, wife?”
“Oh, Peter, I could never mak’ a
speech.”
“Try,” he implored. “I dinna
want to affront ye on Friday, Mar
get. I dinna want to affront masel’
—nor yet the meenister. Try, wum
man, try! Though I was angry last
nicht. I seen that ye kent mair
aboot it than me. Try!”
She shook her head.
“But try,” he persisted. “Ye ’ve a’
the day, when I ’m at ma wark, to be
tryin’; an’ at nicht we ’ll try again
together.”
She shook her head again, but this
time, without looking at him, she
murmured:
“Weel, I’ll try, Peter.”
* * * * *
When tea was over that night and
the dishes washed Mrs. Mcßean
brought out several sheets of fools
cap. Mr. Mcßean read them over
with a critical air while she regarded
him uneasily.
“It’s no’ bad,” he observed at last.
“I didna think ye was that clever,
wife. I think I ’ll maybe be able to
pit this into shape. The chief fau’t
is that ye dinna say enough aboot
the meenister. 1 ’ll need to butter
him up a bit.”
“Oh, but, Peter,” she said ner
vously, “d’ ye think he wud like
that? He ’s an awfu’ modest man,
ye ken. Ye wudna like to be but
tered up yersel’ afore a’ the congre
gation.”
“That ’s true; but it ’s the correct
thing to butter up meenisters at so
cial gatherin’s. Still, the speech ye
’ve made, Marget, is no’ sae bad, an’
I ’ll mak’ the best I can o’ it.”
Once more Mr. Mcßean fell to with
his pencil. He soon found, however,
that he could make little improve
ment on the original manuscript,
and finally contented himself with
copying it out and spelling a few of
the words differently.
That night he slept soundly, but
his wife was restless, and the fol
lowing day she complained of her
old enemy rheumatism. Mr. Mcßean
had to go to the presentation gath
ering alone.
He returned swelling with impor
tance, glowing with satisfaction.
“Weel, Peter, hoo did ye get on?”
Marget asked unsteadily.
“Splendid, jist splendid! I was
receivin’ compliments for the rest o’
the evenin’. Maister Drummond—
him that gi’ed the five pound—said
it was the neatest speech ever he
heard.”
“Did the meenister seem pleased?”
“Deed, ay! An’ nae wonder! The
applause y was tremendous, as they
say in the papers.”
Mrs. Mcßean gave a sigh of relief.
“An’,” continued her husband,
jauntily, “I ’ve been requested to de
liver a speech at the Odd-fellows’
gatherin’ next month —”
“Oh! —Oh!”
“What ’s ado?”
“Oh, Peter, promise ye ’ll never,
never mak’ anither speech.”
“Hoots, wife! It’s the first plunge
that’s the warst. I ’ve confidence in
masel’ noo. I could face ony audi
ence in the warld,” he said airily.
Then he saw that she was very se
rious. But even then he would not
give the promise desired. If folk
enjoyed his speech-making, why
should he refuse to pleasure them?
In the morning, however, his en
thusiasm, happily for the old wo
man’s sake, had cooled considerably.
“Ester a’,” he remarked casually,
at breakfast, “I think I ’ll gi’e up
the speechifying, Marget. I —l ’ll
rest on ma laurels, as the sayin’ is.”
She could scarce speak for thank
fulness, but she managed to say:
“Is that a promise, Peter? Ye
see, I —l ’m geetin’ ower auld for
the —the excitement.”
“Havers!” he said laughing. “But
it ’s a promise a’ the same.”
After he had gone to his work she
sat awhile by the hearth —an unus
ual proceeding for her in the day
time. But the reaction had been a
severe one.
Rousing herself at last she rose,
and from a drawer, which she un
locked, took a folded paper. She
opened it and glanced over the lines
of small, clear writing. Then she
placed it on the fire and watched it
being consumed.
“Oh,” she sighed, “he ’s a kind
man, the meenister; but though it
was to save ma life, I could never
ask him to write anither speech for
Peter.” —Success Magazine.
