Independent Movements. Uli
Webster has a peculiar, particular be
and significant definition for those T
who propose to assume the role of in- sho)
dependent candidates under the ex- one
isting status of affairs. For once in upe
the history of Louisiana, since the ern
close of the war, under a sea of tron- has
bles, difficulties, dangers and oppres- etal
sions, the control of affairs is passing veI
into the hands of those to whom it R
properly belongs-the white citizens
of the State, those who represents its car
intelligence, wealth and integrity. ref
Yet there are those who prate of an Re
Independent movement, who disap
pointed in some individual scheme the
for personal aggrandizement, declaim the
against the nominations recently lo,
made by the Democratic convention the
and propose to oppose their success- on
ful election. Maybap they belong to as
that clas of our citizens who can
sleep calmly amid "our sea of diffi
culties" and after the danger is past
arouse out of their refreshing slum
bers and make light of the evils which
have threatened their homes and
families. Independent candidates,
at this particular and peculiar time
smacks of opposition to the announced wl
choice of the people. It proclaims m;
emphatically, that these men-luke- pe
warm at best--are ready to oppose to
the mass of our citizens in their at- w,
tempts not only at self-government,
but at self-preservation. The victory la
is almost won, the slogan that has ap- th
pealed in warning notes for long ly
years to keep bright and burning the ly
watch fires of constitutional liberty, to
at last peals forth triumphant echoes w
o'er bill and vale, its voice of triumph p,
and victory, A

Who has not in his soul proclaimed,

this wicked world without a protec'i"or

was satistied his sisters would marry and

eternal happiness, and like a christian
soldier, he crossed his hands and elevated
his voice in prayer to his Great Creator,
appealing to him to forgive him for all
the sins he had committed, and to have
mercy. He called the old and faithful
f servant to hear his instructions, how and
where to dig his grave, denoting the spot
in the garden beneath the Cedar tree,
and next to his father and brother. Thus

A short time since I was arrested un

in really oecnrr d would he all suftlhient
- against this fellow, who is devoid of hon
or, decency and character-h-lt fortu
ill nately there were present three others
whose certifirates I give below, who
state that I lad not the semilance of an
arm upon my person, and that I was in
nry my shirt sleeves, and could not have
eii cor'tealed a wealpon if I had had one.
These gentlemen state that so '1fa"r from
sv striking the wife and chill, I did not
it touch even Manola, though I made every
effort to do o, bulit was prevented by the
ow by-standers.
oar Born and raised in Louisiana, passed
Sof four years of service in the Confederate
army, the meanest enemy I have in the
world woul I not so egregiously lie as to
sad accuse me of the base and cowardly act
charged in this man's affidavit.
Although there is no necessity for this

coward Manola's charge may not know
the testimony of the witnesses and the
by act of the Court.
let Very Respectfully,

We, the undersigned, were present at
the store of Isaac Manola on the 2d inst.
y of and were witnesses of the personal dif
ficulty between A. F. Grimmer and Isaac
Stay Manola, and we state that Mr. Grimmer
neither struck Mrs. Manola or her child.
Mr. Grimmer very gentlemanly said to
Mrs. Manola that if he had injured either
herself or child with tumblers and hot
ties thrown at Manola, he asked a thor
sand pardons, but he did not touch
either of them.
