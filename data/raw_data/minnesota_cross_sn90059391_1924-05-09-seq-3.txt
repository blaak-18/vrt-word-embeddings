AMERICAN’S DEATH
STARTS PROBE OF
JAIL CONDITIONS
Klansman Owen H. Poor
baugh of Johnstown Dies
of Pneumonia in Prison
HUGE FUNERAL IS HELD
Members From All Parts of
PennßylTania Attend Last
Rites for Colleague
(By S. THOMAS ZENER, Jr.)
JOHNSTOWN, PA., April 29.—A1l
Pennsylvania is awaiting the outcome
of the investigation tomorrow by the
prison board of Cambria county into
conditions and circumstances at the
Ebensburg jail, which resulted in the
death by pneumonia of Klansman
Owen H. Poorbaugh, aged 48, of
Johnstown, last Friday.
Poorbaugh’s sister, Mrs. Nellie G.
Shaffer, in a sworn affidavit, declares
he stated before his death here in
Memorial hospital that he had been
forced to sleep in a draft with in
sufficient bedclothing and was re
quired to walk to the ambulance
which took him to Johnstown, after a
writ of habeas corpus had been grant
ed by Judge John E. Evans for his
release under guard. Poorbaugh was
a companion prisoner with 27 other
Klansmen in the Ebensburg jail, be
ing held in connection with the not
at Lilly, Pa-, Saturday night, April
6, when a mob of townspeople at
tacked marching Klansmen.
What action will be taken by the
prison board is entirely a matter of
conjecture, denial of Poorbaugh s sis
ter’s affidavit having been strongly
made by one of the prison attaches.
It has come to the mind of right
thinking persons throughout the
•tate that a man on his death bed
would hardly issue statements derog
atory to anyone, and especially one
of the character of Poorbaugh.
The funeral services held Sunday
afternoon for the martyred Klans
man marked possibly one of the most
epochal events in the history of the
country—certainly in Pennsylvamij.
Feeling has been aroused to a high
pitch throughout the entire Cambria
county district due to the attack

Five Factors in
Good Citizenship
Asserts Educator
(Scottish Rite News Bareaa)
WASHINGTON. D. C., May L
There are five factors of good citi
zenship, according to Dr. Henry, Lew
is Smith, President of Washington
and Lee University. These five great
ideas, action according to which is
essential if citizenship is to attain
its true worth and dignity, are:
First, the children of the nation
are at once the richest asset and the
chief source of power, more poten
tial than all of the other human
sources combined; therefore, their
proper development is of the first im
portance.
Second, the supreme task of a
Christian democracy is the right
training of all its citizens.
Third, education of intellect alone
is fatally inadequate. The heart and
the character must be developed as
the mind is improved, for if they are
not, the work will have been in vain.
Fourth, mere political and industri
al democracy may by its triumph
cause the downfall of civilization, un
less education and religion reach the
masses before they seize the power.
Fifth, when democracy has out
grown its experimental stage and has
become strong, it will be seen that
the real leaders are not politicians,
bankers or statesmen, but those who
have devoted their lives to training
boys and girls. They will be known
then as the real builders of nations
and civilization.
upon the Klansmen at Lilly, and the
refusal of Judge Evans at Ebensburg
to permit them to furnish bail. The
result of this intense feeling which
has permeated virtually the entire
Keystone state was manifested in the
huge crowd which attended both the
services in the Dale Evangelical
church here, and at the graveside in
Grandview cemetery. The sheriff of
Cambria county, a conservative man,
estimated the crowd at between 16,-
000 and 20,000 persons.
Forming at the home of Poorbaugh
at 68 Sell street, the hundreds of
robed Klansmen, directed by Altoona
Klavaliers, marched through long
lines of men, women and children to
the church. Crossed wires in the ig
nition of the motor hearse fired the
dash board, but the casket was saved
from the fire, another took its place,
and the procession moved on.
Arriving at the church, the long
procession filed through the mass of
persons that had gathered in the tri
angle formed by the intersection of
two streets bounding the church.
Led by the stars and stripes and the
fiery cross of the Klan, the pallbear
ers carried the remains of the Klans
men to the flower draped altar, where
it lay in state while services were
conducted in the presence of more
than 2,000 persons who were able to
get in.
The procession from the church to
Grandview cemetery, about two miles
away, was more than two miles in
length. Street car and automobile
traffic was halted by Pennsylvania
state police and local officers during
the entire procession. Large groups
and knots of silent persons gathered
at every vantage point to view the
sad march. . , ,
At the cemetery, the thousands had
gathered to view the last riles of the
Ku Klux Klan. State police and
county officers here made a lane
through the mass of people direct to
the open grave, and through this
passed the Altoona Klavaliers, pre
ceded by the Exalted Cyclops of
Johnstown, and Sam. D. Rich, Acting
Grand Dragon of Pennsylvania A
huge circle, more than 100 yards in
diameter, was formed, robed Klans
men and Klanswomen four deep lock
ing arms and keeping the huge crowd
back. At one point in the circle the
casket was borne through to the
grave. ,
The last rites of the Klan were giv
en by King Kleagle Rich at the
graveside. A quartet of Klansmen
sang “Abide With Me" and other
hymns. As the casket was slowly
lowered into the grave, the final
adieu of the mournful Klansmen was
waved to the martyred Klansmen.
Klan Judge Gives
Walton Fair Trial
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLA., May 1.
—“Jack" Walton, deposed governor
of Oklahoma, was recently acquitted
bu Judge Wells of five charges of
converting public funds in. that state.
In handing down his decision, Judge
Wells said: “I base my opinion on
the laws of Oklahoma. I hope Wal
ton will be fair enough to say he got
a fair deal from one Klansman.
The allegations in the charge were
identical with those on which Walton
was impeached last fall.

The Klan a Distinctive Organization;
Called Benefit to Every Community
By W. C. WRIGHT, Plainview, Texas
Author’s Note
This article giving reasons why the
Klan should exist has been written
for a two-fold purpose.
First. It Is one of the themes for
discussion In the nation-wide educa
tional campaign now being conduct
ed by the Klan.
Second, it Is an answer to the hun
dreds and thousands of good men who,
because they have no Negroes, Jews,
Catholics or foreigners in their com
munity, fall to see a reason for the
Klan.
In the great western plains coun
try of Texas there are comparatively
few negroes, Jews, Catholics and for
eigners. Fully ninety per cent of the
population are native-born, white,
Gentile, Protestant Americans; and
a very large percetnage of them are
of good moral character who believe
in law enforcement and the tenets of
the Christian religion. In view of
these facts, we believe that to justify
the existence of the Klan in this sec
tion would prove iti necessity to any
community in America.
The Klan a Vital Necessity
We therefore undertake to show
that the Klan has a distinctive place
to fill, a special work to do, ana is a
vital necessity to every community.
No organization has any right to ex
ist, nor can it lay any just claim to
the support of good men, unless it
can show that it fills a distinctive
place, and performs a specific service
to humanity. Money extorted from
the people to support an institution
that renders no service in return, is
a form of theft, and should be frowned
upon by all good men. Such an insti
tution is a burden instead of a bless-
We have often heard it said, “there
are but few negroes, Jews, Catholics
and foreigners in this community,
and we see no need of the Klan.”
Those who think that the purpose
and business of the Klan is to oppose
and fight Negroes, Jews, Catholics
and foreigners are sadly mistaken,
and have no conception of its ideals
and principles. True, we do not ad
mit these classes to membership; but
we make no fight on races or relig
ions.
Masons do not admit men who have
lost an arm or a leg; but Masons
are not fighting cripples. They sim
ply demand that a man must be
sound in body to be eligible to mem
bership. We do not believe that the
negro is fighting the white race be
cause he excludes the white man from
his secret orders; or that the Jew is
fighting Christians because he ex
cludes them from the B’nai B’rith; or
that Catholics are fighting Protest
ants simply because they exclude
them from the Knights of Columbus.
They have a perfect right to name
these conditions of membership.
Since the Klan is not fighting races
or religions, the presence of these el
ements in a community does not jus
tify the existence of the Klan, nei
ther does their absence prove that it
is unnecessary.
First, it should be remembered that
the Klan is a national organization
and deals with nation-wide problems,
as well as local conditions. Even if
its activities were entirely local it
could not be truly said of any com
munity, “we have no need of a Klan
here.” But since every community
should be vitally interested in the
public welfare of the nation as a
whole, and each one has special con
ditions with which the Klan deals, it
cannot be truthfully stated of any
place that there ii no need of an or
ganisation that has to do with nation
al problem* and teaks to Improve na
tional aa wajl as local conditions.
THE FIERY GROSS
Nellie G. Shaffer, his sister, sets forth
the declaration that Poorbaugh’s
death was due to insufficient bed
clothing in the jail, lack of proper
medical attention and uncivil treat
ment when being taken to the hospi
tal. Poorbaugh was a companion
Erisoner with 27 other Klansmen, all
eing held in connection with the
attack upon marching Klansmen at
Most of our problems are of national
scope and airectly concern every
communitv in America.
Of Interest to Every Cltiscn
Take, for instance, white suprem
acy, law enforcement, free public
schools, education, Christianity con
stitutional rights of citizenship, pro
tecton of the home, chastity of wo
manhood, separation of church and
state, liberty, the pursuit of happi
ness, and the development of charac
ter; all these are not only local, but
national problems as well, which
should demand the active co-opera
tion and fearless support of all good
citizens everywhere. Every citizen
should be vitally and actively inter
ested in the fundamental principles
of Americanism —American ideals and
institutions—irrespective of any lo
cal needs or dangers.
If these great principles are at
tacked or endangered in any locality,
and the danger is not checked, it is
only a question of time when every
community in America will suffer
from the effect. All good Americans
are interested in the safety and con
cern of the rights of citizenship ev
erywhere, and will not selfishly rest
secure in the safety of their own lit
tle locality, because they see no im
mediate local danger.
A Benefit to Every Community
The injury of one uhould be, and is,
the concern of all. The apostle Paul
very fitly says of the church (the
body of Christ), “whether one mem
ber suffers, all the members suffer
with it,” and thia can be truly said
of the thousands of communities that
make up the body politic in America.
For that reason alone every commun
ity should be interested in having a
Klan.
Development of Character Klan Aim
“The prime purpose of this great
order is to develop character.” W®
have never lived in a community
where the character of its citizenship,
as a whole, was what it should be.
We believe that the development of
real manly character is a vital need
in every community.
We know hundreds of men in the
Klan whose characters have been ma
terially and substantially improved
through the influence, environment
and teachings of the Klan. We also
believe that all real Klansmen have
a more profound sense of honor, high
er ideals of morality, keener appreci
ation of Christianity, a greater re
spect for law and constituted au
thority, and a broader vision of the
duties of citizenship than they had
before they became Klansmen.
The Klan, by Its high ideals, noble
sentiments and sacred principles, in
culcates and cultivates a manly de
sire to be better, cleaner men, mor
ally, mentally, physically and spirit
ually. The citizens of every commun
ity, and especially young men, need
just such moral, spiritual and patri
otic training, environments and in
fluence as the Klan affords. It is a
great character builder because of its
high ideals, noble purposes and sa
cred sentiments. Every Klansman.
by the presence of the cross, is con
stantly reminded that he has accept
ed Christ as his criterion of charac
ter and the twelfth chapter of Ro
mans aa his law of life.
This reason alone, the development
of character, is sufficient to justify
the need of a Klan in every commun
Ity.

Lower (left) —This photo gives
mute evidence of the spirit manifest
ed by thousands of Pennsylvania
Klansment and other citizens at
Johnstown. The throngs are seen
tance and responsibility of attending
and supporting the church. The Klan
is a great force and influence in com
pelling men to take more interest in
the church. Every Klansman is urged
to attend, support and unite with
some church; to accept Christ, not
only as his criterion of character,
but as his personal savior as well.
This phase of the Klan’s work alone
has brought thousands of good men
into more active Christian service,
and is baadly needed in in every com
munity in America.
Coordinating Force
Religious and fraternal affairs in
America today are in a deplorable
condition. Protestantism is divided
into nearly two hundred factions, and
fraternalism into scores of secret so
cieties. Each one stands for some
great principles of right, but our di
vided and segregated condition great
ly weakens our cause and lessens our
chance for success in accomplishing
the things we stand for.
What we need in every community
in America is some co-ordinating
medium that will bring together all
these various organizations into one
militant body so we can present a
solid front. There cannot be such a
thing as an organic union of all Prot
estant churches, nor the combination
of all fraternal societies; but we can
have a kind of clearing house where
we can meet, forget our petty differ
ence and fight for the real fundamen
tals for which we all stand. The Klan
is iust that kind of an organization
ana serves that purpose as no other
can.
It seeks to jind all Protestantism
together in a common cause against
a common foe. It seeks to bind all
Christianity together against heath
enism, infidelity, agnosticism, athe
ism and idolatry. It seeks to bind the
white Caucasian race together against
the overwhelming hordes of colored
races. It seeks to bind all law-abid
ing. peaceful, liberty-loving people
together against the vicious lawless
elements who have no regard nor re
spect for constituted authority. It
seeks to bind together the good men
who believe in clean government
against the crooked scheming politi
cians, grafters and un-American for
eigners. It seeks to combine all that
is good and really worth while in all
of the fraternal societies that we
know anything about. It seeks to
bind together all native-born Ameri
cans against that ever-increasing
horde of foreigners that come to our
shores with their foreign ideals and
influences.
So the Klan is a great clearing
house for churches and fraternities,
seeking to co-ordinate all the forces
for good against the forces of evil.
Seeking to develop character, main
tain white supremacy, enforce the
law, defend the public school, pro
tect the home and the chastity of
womanhood, guarantee constitution
al rights and personal liberties,
stamp out illiteracy, uphold Chris
tianity, insure the separation of
churcn and state, the pursuit of hap
piness and exalt the Christ, there is
a vital need of a Klan in every com
munity in America.

CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
OPPOSITION SPREADS
Judge Ren B. Lindsey of DenYer
Heads Movement in
Colorado
(Scottish Rite News Bureau)
WASHINGTON, D. C., May 1.-Cal
ifornia may join the states which have
done away with capital punishment.
Judge Ben. B. Lindsey, touring the
state in opposition to judicial kill
ing as punishment for crime, believes
that an initiative petition will result
in the elimination of capital punish
ment in California and Colorado.
In speaking of his campaign, Judge
Lindsey stated:
“Capital punishment should go
with the slave market and the whip
ping post. At least it should be so
amended in its present aspects as to
allow some leniency to those who,
having made a mistake, later see
their error, repent, and through spir
itualizing influences are fairly ‘born
again’ in a permanently changed at
titude and viewpoint on life.
"Two wrongs do not make one
right, and the perfunctory centencing
and hanging of men is a crime of it
self, especially when a thoroughly re
formed man is sacrificed to a formal
ity of law, even though regenerative
forces, subsequent to his crime, ren
der him in the judgment of moral
and spiritual law, an innocent man.
• "We are working to these conclu
sions in Colorado. Governor William
E. Sweet appointed a committee on
social welfare legislation, a represen
tative group of 100 leading prison
workers in the state. We are draft
ing outlines of a bill for a prison re
form act. It provides for a complete
adult probation system, means for
requiring the state to employ its
prisoners in useful work —road-build-
ing, cement-making, and the like —
where no serious competition to free
labor obtains; rigid application of
the principle that the state has no
moral right to scatter and destroy a
man’s dependents by cutting off his
earning power.”

J. H. Krenmyre Talks to
Masonic Study Club at
Davenport, lowa
TOPIC IS YELLOW PERIL
Rotten Politics is Nation-Wide
Problem—Only 48 Per Cent
Of People Voted
DAVENPORT, IA., May 3.—-The
cost of maintaining the public school
system in the United States amounts
to approximately four and one-half
cents per day per person,” declared
J. H. Krenmyre in speaking recently
before the Masonic Study club of this
place. The topic of his address was,
•The Yellow Peril.”
“That does seem expensive, doesn’t
it?” continued the speaker. “But re
member that according to the report
of the American Tobacco Company it
cost us about 9 cents per person per
day for tobacco and about 6 cents per
person per day for candy and 16 cents
for joy rides. Now it isn’t that our
schools cost too much when we com
pare them with other things.
Leaders Needed
“The thing that man is crying for
who is against the school tax is that
we should ease up on it so that he
will have more for these other things.
We need men with backbones to
champion the cause of the public
school.
“One of the very fundamentals of
our fraternity is the ‘equality of op
portunity.' We must give every boy
and girl an equal chance. Is it any
wonder that our laboring people be
come dissatisfied when repeatedly
they hear and read of attempts to
curtail their only chance of self-im
provement?”
Speaking of politics, Mr. Krenmyre
said:
Rotten Polities
‘The problem of rotten politics is
another problem that need not be.
Do you know that only 48 per cent of
our voters cast a ballot at the last
election? Think of 62 per cent stay
ing at home. Then think of how
many voted politics instead of good
government. There isn’t a grafter or
a radical in politics but that is there
because of the lack of backbone in
our citizenship.
“If any of you are guilty, you are
even more guilty than the rest, for
you have sworn to defend good gov
ernment. The blood of the crimes of
the day is upon the hands of thoee
who fail in this civic duty. Equality
before the law, law enforcement, and
justice can be ours if we go forth re
membering that we belong to the
common brotherhood of man and then
do our duty."
