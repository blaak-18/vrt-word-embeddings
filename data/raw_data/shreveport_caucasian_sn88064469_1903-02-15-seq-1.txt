CRAWFORD CASE
:A Touching Scene Between Mrs. Craw
ford. Hcr Huolb::lnd and Her Sou.
The feature of attraction at the court
I.house has been the trial of Dr. G. B.
Crawford and his son, Dr. C. C. Craw
ford. of Loves Lake, Red River parish,
indicted for the murder of J. H. Vick
ers in the Manhattan saloon at about
o'clock on the morning of October 7.
9o02. On Noovember 1. 1002, the accused
had a preliminary before Judge A. D).
Lald when Dr. C. C. Crawford was dis
charged and Dr. G. B. Crawford was re
leased a few days afterwards on a bond
of $2,000. At the sittng of the grand
jury on January 6, 19o3, the father and
tth son were indicted for murder. The
accused surrendered to Sheriff Ward on
January 20, and were jailed. The case
was called for trial Wednesday and con
tinued to Thursday owing to absent wit
nesses for the defendants, and after
some legal delays the following named
citizens were empanelled and sworn to
try the case: XW. A. Farmer, B. H.
Roach. C. \V. Lummus. E. C. Hearne,
B. H. Norton, Jack McCain, John E.
Murray. O. P. Ogilvie, W. P. Nicholson.
Charles W\imbish,. L. P. Harrison and
C. W\. Cory. District Attorney Land rep
resented the State. assisted by J. H.
Shepherd and M. C. Elstner, and the de
fendants by J. M. Foster of Thigpen &
Fester. H. P. Wells of Wells & Wells,
and Maples & McDonald. It is in order
to state as a matter of fact that Mr. Elst
nor was not "the leading counsel for the
urosecution assisted by District Attorney
Land and J. Henry Shepherd." as has
been reported in the Thpes and the Jour
nal. Such a statement is ridiculous and
would leave the impression of a personal
or individual prosecution with the State's
attorney assisting. The district attorney
is Always the leading counsel for the
prosecution.
One of the incidents of the trial was
the arrest of Tom Hardy, charged with
attempting to influence jurors in favor
of the accused.
On Friday there was an affecting scene
between the accused and. his family. In
the court house were seated Mrs. G. B.
Crawford and her five daughters aged
from five to fifteen years. and when the
court was adjourned for dinner these
walked to where the elder Crawford and
his son were seated. Dr. Crawford and
his wife embraced and the children could
not repress their pent-up grief. The spec
tators were moved to tears while the
accused, almost speechless from emotion.
endeavored to encourage them and as
sure them that all would he well in the
end.
The testimony was in substance us al
ready detailed in newtpaper. Leports. Had
Dr. Crawford left hi pistol at home he
would not have killed a young man who
had done him no injury and would' not
have been on trial for murder, and yet
this example of the concealed weapon
will have little ;f any effect on some men
who do not consider it safe to go about
in a civilized community unless they
go armed, and being armed with a con
cealed weapon are ready to kill and mur
der on the first opportunity.
The State presentatipn was clear and
forceful.
On behalf uf the defendants it was in
evidence that Vickers held an opened
knife in his hand as he came from be
hipd the bar to meet Dr. C. C. Crawford
who had abused him outrageously, but
this witness was challenged by other wit
nesses. One strong feature of the de
fendants was their effort to show that
Vickers after being "cussed out" by Dr.
C. C.' Crawfqrd, had tried to' get into a
drawer where it was customary to leave
a pistol, but the prosecution demoristrat
ed that when Vickers was shot he was
unarmed nor was there a knife or pistol
found at his side or anywhere about the
body when it was first viewed and taken
away to Waring's to be prepared for
burial. The defendants managed their
case skilfully.
In his charge Judge Land announced
that in defense of his son or his family
Dr. Crawford could shoot the aggressir.
This was the question over which the
jury wrestled.
After hearing the exhaustive charge on
the points of law and the verdict which
it could render, guilty, guilty without
capital punishment. or not guilty, the
jury retired to consult over their verdict
which was: C. C. Crawford not guilty.
The jury then retired to-consider their
conclusion as to Dr. G. B. Crawford:

WILLIAM R. IEARSTH
IS NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES
At Rally (,f Jefferson-Jackson-Luno.ln
League--Bryans Bitter Attack on
A\lleged Democrats \Vho Carry
Knivus Up Their Sleeve.
A rally of leaders ,f Democracy was
theld in Coluntbus. O., on Thursday. Feb- h
ruary 12, under the auspices of the Jef
ferson-Jack son-Lincoln League, organ- p
ized a year ago by ex-Congressman John t
J. Lentz and others. At this barbecue e
rally there were twelve hundred invited 11
guests. William J. Bryan received an eti- tI
thusiastic ovation. In the course of a F
bitter attack on alleged deserters from )
the Democratic party he asserted that if
there is any ,tone man in the country who
has suffered on accouutt of the lack of
Democratic harmony he is that man, and
charged that it was the opposition of al
leged Democrats within the ranks of his
party that brought him to defeat in 1896
and 19oo.
He said that lie knew all the men who
had gone astray in those years, and that t
since that time they had suffered severe
heart-burning.
"If it is such a serious affair to change
party allegiance," Mr. Bryan said. "I
hope these men will stay out of the Dem
ocratic party. There can be no harmony c
between Democrats who. carry knives
for each other and hate each other.
There is a better chance to make Dentm
ocrats out of Republicans than out of
Palmer attd Buckner Democrats.
"These men can never be in harmony
with us, unless they or we change out
political convictions. 1 stilt believe in
the platform adopted at Chicago in
t896, and in Kansas City in 19oo. I have
no thought of surrendering my convic
tions. Our principles were true then;
they are true now. I would not change
them if I could. Neither would I surren
der my principles to win any victory, t
however great, for my party. A party,
like a man, needs a character and a
membership that knows what is right
and. ill do it in the advocacy of political
pi'inciples."
Mit. Bryan said he did not propose to t
take his Democracy froht any Demo
cratic leader who received his training'
front \Vall street.
Mr. W. R. Hearst, who had been in
vited to address the banquet, sent his
regrets in a telegram in which he said
in part :
"The history of a country is really the
history of a few great men. In these
men are crystallized the country's real
life and worth. Theirs is the genius that
gives expression and reality to the con
victions and principles of the people
wholm they represent. The three tames
that youl have chosct to he reverend in
unison are the greatest names int the
.American people's[ history, save. of
course, the foundatnon name of Wash
ington.
'Washington stands apart. He repre
sents the struggle against foreign su
premiacy.
" The three men whom you meet to
honor are the representatives of plans
and thoughts and beliefs of the Ameri
can nation as a free nation.
"Washington made American self
government possible, but Jefferson,
Jackson and Lincoln directed American
government into its popular demooratic
channel and made it true.
"Until very recently, Jefferson, Jack
soni and Lincolr could possibly be called
typical of both of our great political
parties. A'1 three of these men stood for
the rights of all the people, and their
views have been represented in every
great movement until these latter days.
"It can not be denied that today one
of the political parties has divorced' it
self form American principles and from
these great American statesmen.
"it is the duty of the Democratic party
to return the power of the government
to the people by allying itself with those
popular political forces best able to ac
complish that result.
"What force in the United tSates is
today most in harmony with true Dem
ocracy and best able to compete with
this financially organized usurpation of
government ?
"To succeed. the Democratic party
must work under the inspiartion of-the
great names and thoughts of Jefferson.
Jackson and Lincoln. And it must work
in co-operation with the organized man
hood and independence of this country,
the great Democratic force of today."
At this gathering ex-Governor Budd
of California nominated Mr. Hearst for
President of the United States in an adc
mirable: address, in which he said:

fEATHER IULLI I.
The Cold. the WVarm and the Storm
Waves Forecasted.
(Copyrighted 1903 by W\. T. Foster.)
St. Joseph. Mo., Feb. 14.-Last blie
tin gave forecasts of disturbance to
cross the continent February t, to 20.
warm wave 15 to 17, cool wave IC1 to 22.
The next disturbance will reach the
Pacific cast about February 22. cross
west o fthe Rockies by close of 23, great
central valleys 24 to 26, eastern states
27.
I expect this to be a radical disturb
ance of large dimension and that it will
pass along mid-latitudes affecting all of
the North American continent. The tem
perature will go high about the time this
storm center is on your meridian but the
high temperature will be of short dura
tion. The threatening day will be on
meridian go about February 25 and will
be of that peculiar kind that usually
precedes a blizzard.
The term "threatening" which I use
often may .need some further explana
tions. If the storm center passes north
of you -it will cause hot weather and the
cool wave following will not go to very
low ttmperatures. If it passes south of
you the warm wave -will not go to very
high degrees while the cool wave will go
to lower temperatures than usual. If the
storm center passcs over you the warm
wave will be very warm and the cool
I wave very cool.
Warm wave will cross west of the
Rockies about February 22. great cen
tral valleys 24, eastern states 26. Cool
wave will cross west of Rockies about
February 25, great central valleys 27,
eastern states 29.
T'his warm wave and the cool wave
following will go to greatest extremes
along parallel 40.
The above extremes of a storm wave,
thqt is the warm wave first, the storm
center following and the cold wave fol
e lowing that will probably be a compound
disturbance, such as we had the last
dlays of January and first days of Feb
ruary and which was repeatedly an
nounced in these bulletins.
These great difturbances usuallyy he
gin with a warm wave, a storm center
a and a cold wave passing along the
s boundary between the United States and
Canada. A few days later another comn
plete set of storm elements pass east
ward about five hundred miles south of
the farmer set. Then comes the third
set passing about one thousand miles
south of the first.
In these compound or complex storm
disturbances the first set of elements will
be a day or two earlier than my fore
casts indicate, the second set about qn
time and the third set a day or two he
hind the dates indicated. I seldom miss
these great or compound disturbances. I
have not missed one of them for six
months, and you may count on one dur
ing last days of February and first day
of March.
The Fargo Forum says: "The Car
rington Record borders on the impos
sible when it intimates the public has
even less faith in the ground hog-than

casts in The Forum.'" And in the Can

DR. J. L. Al.\ CURRY DEAD.
Dr. J. L. M. Curry, agent for the
Peabody educational fund, died Thurs
day at Asheville. N. C. He was a great
and good man and his death is a gre:t
loss to the negro education in the South.
-Shreveport Enterprise.
The clipping quoted is from the En
terprise published by A. H. Samuels, a
colored man, in the interest of colored
people. He has well said of Dr. Curry
that "he was a great and good man."
And we may add he was a substantial,
earnest, sincere friend of the negro; a
better and a truer friend of the Negro
than Teddy Roosevelt, or Crumpacker
or Dr., Parkhurst and all the howling,
sanctimonious hypocrites at the North
who pretend to love the nigger. The
Peabody educational fund is the great
gift of George Peabody. who, unlike
Carnegie, distributed his millions for the
sake of humanity and not to advertise
himself in life and his name to poster
ity in libraries created'and endowed with
reserved string attachments. Some day
the Negro will reach the full sense of
reali7tttion that his friends are not those
who, like Teddy, would use them as
cats paws to pull political chestnuts from
the red-hot furnace. The Negro can have
no better friend than the Southern white
man, whose feeling for him is kindlier
than was ever or cemn ever he entertained
by the white men at the North who sim
ply have a. theoretical, a superficial idea
of his nature and lis condition, his
weakness and his virtues. In the South
no negro can starve or die froml want.
He is offered every reasonable oppor
tunity for a(lvancement and he is pro
vided with public schools in which to
educate his children. The Negro can
have no better, kindlier friend than the
Southern white man, with whom he
played and fished and hunted when they
were boys.
