THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG,
I SAY.
By Pius Clements.
I have of’en, of’en wundered,
Why the honest workin’ man
Keeps a jist a gittin’ poorer,
Though he does the best he can,
While the rich is gittin’ richer,
Though they never work a day,
Go to Europe huntin’ pleasure,—
Thar is somethin’ wrong, I say.
Thar’s the Goulds an’ Rockefellers,
An’ a passel uv ’em who
Own the earth an’ all that’s on it
And they ’bout own me an’ you;
Why, the’r dogs git better feedin’
Than the toiler uv today,
A segar they’re always smokin’ —
Thar is somethin’ wrong, I say.
Bacon’s high, an’ beans is higher,
While we have to work a day
Jist to buy a sack o’ flour,
An’ it mout go up, they say.
’Taters that we used to purchase
For two bits, is now away
Up beyant a workin’ feller —
Thar is somethin’ wrong, I say.
Every fiian who holds an office
Has his wages raised each year,
While the toilers work for nothin’,
With no hope to give ’em cheer;
They’re the ones who pay the taxes,
Fer the trusts but little pay,
They're the lords uv creation —
Thar is somethin’ vrrong, I say.

THE DUTY ON TEA.
Senator Tillman’s proposed amend
ment to the tariff bill providing for
a duty of ten cents a pound on tea
calls forth an expression from the
Columbia Record on the subject.
Mr. Tillman’s object, of course, is
to secure protection to the amount
of the proposed duty for the tea
growers of South Carolina, tea cul
ture being one of that State’s infant
industries and ,a very small industry
in comparison with the amount of
tea imported by the United States.
The output of the South Carolina
tea farms is twelve thousand pounds
annually, while the importation
reaches one hundred and ten million
pounds. A duty of ten cents a
pound eleven million
dollars of revenue to the Govern
ment, and the people’s tea bill would
be increased by the same amount.
As to the price of tea and the in
crease thereof, which would follow
from the placing of this duty on the
article, our Columbia contemporary
says:
“Tea retails at from 25 cents to
51.50 per pound, the most common
ly used tea costing the consumer
from 50 cents to sl, the Soujji Caro
lina tea selling at 50 cents and 80
cents usually. It may be estimated,
therefore, that the average price of
tea per pound is 60 cents in this
country, and to add a tax of ten cents
per pound means an increase of
16 2-3 per cent, in the price to the
tea consumer.’’
A tax of 16 2-3 per cent, is a
heavy one to put on this article; but
that is not the greatest hardship. It
is the rate at what the Record says
is the average price; but we must
bear in mind that a great many con
sumers of tea buy a cheaper article,
Public Opinion Throughout the Union
A Weekly Paper Edited by THOS. E. J. D. WA TSON
and they, of course, are among the
poorer classes. These persons will
be taxed more than the average of
16 2-3 cents, while those who can
afford to buy that which sells above
the average price will be taxed much
less. With a duty of ten cents per
pound on tea the person who buys
the 25-cent quality will pay a tax of
4 0 per cent., while his more prosper
ous neighbor who can afford the
$1.50 quality is taxed only 6 2-3 per
cent.
We can see no fairness or justice
in this. If it is necessary to put a
duty on tea to assist in providing a
revenue for the Government, let it
be an ad valorem tax, which will
bear alike on all consumers of the
article. If it is considered advisable
to establish this tax as a protection
<o the South Carolina tea growers
and to encourage more extensive
production, why tax to the extent of
4 0 per cent, grades used by the poor
er classes not coming in competition
with the products of the South Caro
lina farms?
This is a very clear instance where
if there is to be any duty at all it
should be ad valorem and not spe
cific. The former would bear equal
ly on all classes, while a specific duty
would make the tax on the cheapest
grade over six times greater than
that of the most expensive.
INCOME TAX.
An income tax is fair, equitable
and democratic. It has been good
Democratic doctrine these many
years that wealth should bear its
full measure of the burdens of tax
ation, which under the existing sys
tem raising it does not. But if an
income tax is to depend upon Repub
lican support in the Senate for its
incubation, it is not apt to even be
born. President Taft spoke well of
it in his message, but he has not
urged the matter very strongly since.
Senator Aldrich, who holds the Re
publican destinies of the Senate in
the palm of his hand, does not favor
an income tax. Neither do his mil
lionaire colleagues, and that proba
bly settles it. —The Better Way.
OUR PUBLIC DISGRACE.
The pardoning of the infamous
Taylor and the rest of the unspeak
able gang who brought about Wil
liam Goebel’s murder has drawn
upon the “spineless cactus” who
holds the high office of Governor of
Kentucky, the indignation and dis
gust of all citizens of the common
wealth who want to see justice main
tained and the forms of law, at least,
respected.
Confronted by so monstrous a
crime against the good name of our
State, we find our vocabulary wholly
inadequate to express our feelings of
horror and condemnation.
We expected Willson to turn the
rascals loose, for he was evidently
committed to such a plan during his
campaign. The surprise comes that
even so rabid a partisan as Willson
would so insult the people of Ken
tucky by pardoning the conspirators
in the foulest crime ever committed
in the State, before giving them an
opportunity to establish their inno
cence (?) before a jury. It is an in
dictment against the Republican par
ty to say that Taylor, et al., could

not now get what they would call a
“fair” trial, for the whole machin
ery of the government, even down to
the janitor of the State House, is in
their hands and they could have se
lected any kind of judge they want
ed to try the fugitives. The truth of
the matter is the whole gang is guil
ty and did not want any kind of a
trial, and no one knows this better
than Willson.
No other state was ever disgraced
by such an exhibition of partisan
ship by its governor. Unless we are
sadly mistaken, Willson’s action does
not meet the approval of the best
element in his own party.—Adairs

JUSTICE TO THE SOUTH IN
HISTORY.
The Jacksonville Times-Union re
cently directed attention to the man
ner in which our American histories
exalt everything Northern and ig
nore or minimize everything South
ern, which has had the effect of de
priving the South of credit justly
due her in many places, and of caus
ing the student of history to get
a wrong conception of historical
events.
The Times-Union instanced the
landing of the colonists at Plymouth
Rock, which has been so exalted that
most people believe that from this
event dates the settlement of our
country. Yet the truth is that the
Spaniards had made settlements in
Florida fifty years before the May
flower brought over her cargo of
colonists, John Smith’s colony had
been settled in Virginia thirteen
years, and the Dutch had been in
New Amsterdam (New York) six
years. In spite of this our histories
make of the latter landing in New
England the leading event, and ig
nore the previous settlements or fail
to give them the proper credit of
priority.
When resistance to the English
Government began our histories tell
at length of the “Boston tea party,”
as if the first overt act of resistance
had been committed in that place,
when in fact eight years before this
event overt resistance to the Eng
lish colonial taxes was started in
North Carolina, and the Bostonians
merely followed the example set by
North Carolinians. The Mecklen
burg declaration of independence
preceded the Philadelphia declara
tion. Had it been done in Massa
chusetts the histories would have
amplified this fact. Being done in
North Carolina they preserve such si
lence on the subject that only close
students of history are aware of it.
WATSON ■ - - --1
This is the knife which The Jeffersonians are
offering as a premium for new subscriptions to
the magazine or the weekly. It’s a beauty.
The battle of Lexington is set down
as the first battle of the Revolution,
when as a matter of fact the first
armed conflict took place in North
Carolina some time before. And so
all the way through. Everything
Northern is exalted and everything
Southern ignored or given scant
credit.
Perhaps this is not to be charged
to design, but to a natural cause.
The first historians were Northern
men. They were better acquainted
with what had happened in the
North, and they wrote of what they
knew best. So they told of Lexing
ton and Bunker Hill, of Paul Re
vere’s ride, of the Pilgrim Fathers
at Plymouth, and they said nothing
of Alamance and Guilford, of Nancy
Hart’s exploits, of John Smith’s col
ony or other Southern events, of
which they knew little or nothing.
And subsequent historians followed
in their wake.
What is needed is a history of our
country written by a Southern man,
willing to do full justice to the North
but capable of doing equal justice to
the South. Such a history would be
quite different from any that we
have now, and it would show that in
all that has made our country great,
from the first settling of the country
to the battle of Santiago, won under
a Southern commander, the South has
contributed her full share.
The South has such a man. Hon.
Thomas E. Watson would fail to
make his literary labors complete if
he failed to add to his other already
famous historical works*a history of
our country, on the lines of his Life
of Jefferson and his Life of Jackson.
Mr. Watson has rendered the coun
try and the South distinguished ser
vice, but a history of the country,
from its first settlement to the pres
ent time, written as he would write
it, with equal fairness to the South
and North, would be the greatest of
all his service in the permanent good
it would do. —Augusta Herald.
IN FAVOR OF STAMP TAXES.
The American boy may not know
much about taxation, but he has a
decided opinion concerning stamp
taxes. He abhors them. He believes
that they have something to do with
kings, and are one of the pernicious
results of war, when they are not the
cause of it. The American politi
cian, having been a boy, retains his
young aversion to stamp taxes. The
male population, for the most part,
grows up and passes on to the grave
in the fixed belief that stamp taxes
are pernicious, possibly inventions of
