WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
Chanipioa American C('aie Paper !
Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
can artists, anal contributed to by the
most popular humorists and satirists of
thie day.
Wild Oats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
Shas become the established humorous and
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as a
monthly, then, to satisfy the detmand of
the public, it was changedl to a fortnight
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting flly as it dies, and showing up
the political and s:cial shams by its
masterly cartoons and pungeant editorials,
it achievwd even greater success than
before, and was recognized as tht ablest
Sand brightest of itsclass. Since then we
Ihave yielded still further to the publie
[demand, and now publish Wild Oats
i weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
ing the first Euccessful weekly hnmorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnis!, illustrations f r Wild Oats are
t Frank Bellew, 'lhomas Worth. Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, .Jump, Keettels,
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to fame.
t In its literary departments Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one tirst-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
f will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as Ilo word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fas
t tidious.

treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influnence upon these vari

There is no cathartic for the purpose
