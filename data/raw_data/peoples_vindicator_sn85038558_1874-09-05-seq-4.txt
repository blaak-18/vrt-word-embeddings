WNo one remedy Is loader
called for by the necessities
of the American people than
a sure and safe cure for
Fever and Ague. Such
we are now enabled to offer,
with a perfect certainty that
ICwill eradicate the disease, and with assur.
sace, founded on proof, that no harm can
arise from its use in any quantity.
That which protects from or prevents this
disorder lust be of inmmense service in the
communities where it prevails. Presetion
is better than cure; for the patient escapes the
risk which he must run in violent attacks of
this baleful distemper. This "CuEtx" expels
the miasmatic poison of 'ever and Agae
from the system, and prevents the develop
ment of the disease, if taken on the first
approach of its premonitory symptoms. A
great superiority of this remedy over any
other ever discovered for the speedy and cer.
tail cure of lntermittents is, that it contains
no Quinine or mineral; consequently it pro.
duce, no quinism or othler injurious elrects
whatever upon the co:stitution. Thlose cured
by it are left as healthby as if they had never
had the disease.
Never and A~me Is not alone the con
sequence of the mlasnmatic Ipisonl. A great
variety of disorders arise from its irritation,
among which are Neursalgia, lCheuma.

eannot accmalnte in sufalicient quantity to

valuable for protection than cure; and few

edy affords.
For Liver Complaints, arising from torpid.

stimulating the Liver into healthy activity,
and prodneing many truly remarkable cures,
