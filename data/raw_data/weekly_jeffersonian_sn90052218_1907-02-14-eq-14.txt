THE BURIAL OF SIR JOHN
MOORE AT CORUNNA.
“The Burial of Sir John Moore”
was one of my reading lessons when
I was a child. A distinguished teach
er says: “It has become a part of
popular education, as has also 4 The
Eve of Waterloo/ and ‘The Death
of Napoleon.’ They are all poems
of great rythmical swing, intense and
graphic.” (1791-1823).
Not a drum was heard, not a funeral
note,
As his corpse to the rampart we
hurried;
Not a soldier discharged his farewell
shot
O’er the grave where our hero we
buried.
We buried him darkly at dead of
night,
The sods with our bayonets turn
ing;
By the struggling moonbeam’s misty
light,
And the lantern dimly burning.
No useless coffin enclosed his breast,
Not in sheet not in shroud we wound
him;
But he lay like a warrior taking his
rest,
With his martial cloak around him.
Few and short were the prayers we
said,
And we spoke not a word of sor
row;
But we steadfastly gazed on the face
that was dead,
And we bitterly thought of the
morrow.
We thought, as we hollow’d his nar
row bed,
And smoothed down his lonely pil
low,
That the foe and the stranger would
tread o’er his head,
And we far away on the billow!
I
Lightly they’ll talk of the spirit
that’s gone,
And o’er his cold ashes upbraid
him—
But little he’ll reck, if they let him
sleep on
In the grave where a Briton has
laid him.
But half of our heavy task was done
When the clock struck the hour for
retiring; y
And we heard the distant and ran
dom gun
That the foe was sullenly firing.
Slowly we sadly laid him down,
From the field of his fame fresh
and gory;
We carved not a line, and we raised
not a stone—
But we left him alone with his
glory.
—C. WOLFE.

“VES, DO SEND ME A BOOK”
Not a bargain book, bought from a haberdasher, but a beautiful
book, a book to caress —peculiar, distinctive, individual: A book
that hath first caught your eye and then pleased your fancy, writ
ten by an author with a tender whim, all right out of his heart.
We will read it together in the gloaming, and when the gather
ing dusk doth blur the page, we’ll sit with hearts too full for
speech and think it over.”—Dorothy Wordsworth to Coleridge.
