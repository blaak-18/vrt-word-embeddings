Legal Tender Money.
Baton Rouge, La. Jan. 10, 1895
Editor Picayune: I have remit
your views of legal tender in yes
terday's issue and I would like to
see you take up and comment on
the following extract from Tiffany:
You would probably interest and
edify your readers, as you are be
coming to be looked upon as quite
an authority on financial problems.
Tiffany says: "Much has been
said about paper money and gold
and silver and copper money, but
after all, such language is decep
tive. There is no such thing, le
gally, as gold and silver money
and paper money. Money is the
measure ofprice, of value; is the
sovereign authority impressed up
on or attached to that which is
capable of taking and retaining
the impress of authority. It is the
recognized presence of sobereigilty
in the market, and in the court,
applying the measrres and deter
mining the quality' of the exchan
ges of commodities, between peas'
ant and prince, between crown nd
people. As a medium of exchange
as a means to an end, it has no
value, but the sovereign will re.
corded on its face, and il rebpei
to its use its value is unchangeable
as the authority which ireated it;
It measures all values by its own
and has no other measure ot valae
Its value being fixed by the will dV
the sovereign, and not by the inh
triansie qualities of that upn wbhich
It is impressed legally, it cannot
vary. Its relativd propidrtion to
other things may disturb their rel
ative values, biut ltd legal value tl
fixed and inmmntasle, whlle tW.
price of commodities measured by
it rises and falls. The philoso
pher can tell the reason, but he
cannot change the laws"
Sabmitted by
'J. T. HOWELLI
Take away the law from behiud
the king and hs is no longer king.
And you will say in America thai
that is theproper thing to do Ibn
caue e kings are tyranta. oand
