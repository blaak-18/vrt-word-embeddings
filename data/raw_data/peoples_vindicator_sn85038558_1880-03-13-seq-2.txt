?I1 REVENUE BILL AND OTHER MATTERS
. -CONTIESTED ELECTION CASES IN THE
I SeNATBR-Ax EXCITING SCENE IN
THE HOUSE-THE WORE OF
TEn WilE-A PAINFUL
REPORT.
(Special Correspondence of the ViN
DICATOR.]
NIw ORLEAxs, Feb. 21, 1880.
- The Geaeral Assembly has made
* much progress during the past week
with the business beftrre it. and a
Is large uomber of bills have been
fi 8aylly pabed in both Houses. Seve
ri Important measures will come up
d for action in a few days. Among
these is
THE REVENUE BILL.
This was made the special order
it for Friday, but after some discussion
then, its further consideration was
PPoelpoed until Monday. when It
wllb taken up in the House and
debated. As It is along bill, and
neerly every member has an amend.
meet, some of them, three or four,
It ls probable that the bill will be
! under discussion ten days, or two
Sweeks. That It will be modified in
- many irtfoolars, seems to be cer
k tlas. Mub oppositions has been
developed to it, especially to that
provision which sets aside three
mills for the interest fund. The
I members reprsenting the levee dim
Striots are opposed to it because it
will reduce the levee fund to one
= fourth of a mill, and the champions
of public education are opposed to it
for a similar reason. They contend
that two mills will not only be amply
Ssufficient for the Interest fund, but
-* will lave a large surplus-about
d $175,000. The Committee on Ways
and Means decided upon three mills
for Interest, In view of the possible
con tieney of the refunding of the
Sentire debt of the State in four per
c. ent as provided for In the
eonsttutlon, which bonds will have
a bte value of seventy-five cents on
the dollar of those for which they
will be exchanged. The Committee
show that while such refunding will
mause a heavier Interest charge at
0 prement, it will save the State several
n millions of dollars in principal and
a Interest by the time the debt is en
tirely liquidated. This is freely ad
mited, but members dissent from the
view that the whole of the debt, or
a even any conside le portion of it.
Swill be refunded lln the next two
years. They Insist that a two mills
tax for Interest purposes, will fully
e meet every requirement, and that
the additional Will proposed is need
ed for, and must be devoted to school
and levee purposes. A lively fight is
1 certain to ensue over this provision
g of the bill, and present lndication
e ate that the three mills Interest
elase will be defeated. Other pr,
al visions of the bill will be fiercely
_ fought, and the dissensions over it
are likely to be of the most animated
character.

MR. JACKONCS DENTISTRY BILL..
Mr. Jackson, of Natch"',clihs, in
troduced a bill iu the H, use somel
time ago, relative to the practice of'
)- dentistry in the State, which makes I
it unlawful for any one to practie
dentistry without having graduated
and received a diploma from a dental
college, or a eerti(clate from a board
,if exatniibilfg denlitse consisting of
as tive dental graduate', who are memg
bers of the L,uisiana State D,'ntal
Society. This examining board is to I
meet annually at the time of the I
meeting of the State Dental Society, 4
or oftener at the call of any two I
members of the board; is to furnish I
certificates to suitable applicants
without fee or charge and to keep a
record of all persons to whom certi
ficates are granted, which shall be
-" evidence in any court of the State. I
Three members of the board will I
constitute a quorum. Penalty for
violating the act is fixed at a fne of i
not less than $50 nor more than $300; I
p but regular physicians and surgeons
k ste excepted from its operations.
One-half of such fines are to go to I
the Dental Society, and the other e
half to the educational fund of the
parish where the offense is congmit. I
ted. Dentists ton practice at the time I
of the passage of tba act are exempt- 1
ed from its provisions. The bill
vassed its second reading by a large t
ir majority, but when it came up for 1
Stfinal action yesterday, lacked several
a votes of a constitutional majority,
It and was therefore defeated. Mr.
d Cosgrove gave notice that he would
d move to reconsider the vote at a fu.
I ture day, and the bill may yet be
r, come a law, although the probabill-.
e ties are against it.
O CONTESTED ELECTIONS IN THE SENATE.
" Saturday last the Senate finally t
o disposed of the contested election
,t case of Luce vs. Brian, from the 7
L Winn district, by confirming, Sena- I
e tor Brian in his seat, by a unanimous c
vote.
t On Thursday the contested case r
from Iberville, D. C. Montan, Demo- C
s crat, vs. J. 8. Davidson, colored Re- e
t publican, was taken up. The Com- d
I mittee on Elections had reported t
y in favor of Mr. Montan, because of a
t large number of illegal votes shown a
t to have been cast in favor of David- L
a son, and the illegal action of the e
s policejuryin charging certain polling t
e places in the interest of Davidson t
e shortly before the election. Counsel t
r was heardl in behalf of the contes- e
a tees. Col. Breaux, of this city, rep. F
a resenting Davidson. Senator Oun
t nlngham then made a strong speech a
) In ,avor of the contestant. When e
a a vote was reached the resolution of t1
I the Committee to eject Davidson and c
t seat Montao, was adopted by 22 to 8. 0
i Senator's Marston, Fontenot, Par
I lange and Rogers, voted with the a
Republicans against the resolution. C
The contested case from the Lafay
a ette district, B. 8. Perry, Democrat,
r vs. A. F. Biard, colored Republican, I
will be considered on Monday. Ae
cording to the face of the returns
s Riard had a majority of fifteen votes. t
r The Committee on Elections have w
t reported in favor of Perry, and it is P
reasonably certain that he will be
I seated. There are thirty reasons for n
s this, stated in the notice of contest c
t filed by Mr. Perry, of which it Is
anecessary to mention but two. 1.
l Riord is Ineligible to a seat in the t1
SSenate, because he had relided in I
r the district only four months before
t the election. 2. It Is shown that in ti
I St. Martin parish an election wse il-I
legally held ata poll which gave him
a arge majority, and that other it. a
legal votes were cast for him else-.
a where in the district. It Is evident S
B that Riord will have to go.
I When this case ei disposed of there A
I will be but four R'publicans in the a'
i Senate-Cohen,8 white, and Mewar, I
1 colored, from the Lat~foursbe-Assuump
t tiou-Terrebornne district; Demas,
Scolored, from St. John; aQd Simmes,
I colored, frotm St. James. 3
STHE C080GROYE-'EBOT CASE
from Natchitoches, was taken upla ina
the House on Monday, and speedily a
disposed of. The committee on elec
I dons reported in favor of confolrming
i Mr. Cosgrove in his seat. Mr. Perot v
I avng bshown no ground of contest ii
I The report was unanimously adopted tl
Sunder a tsuspension of the rules, and d
without debate. ii
REPUBLICAN MEMBERS IN CONTEMPT. B
An exciting scene occurred in the
SHouse of Representatives this morn.
olug. A memorial from Bapblioan N
I members of the House of lReresen.
tatives to the Senate of the United
SStates was sent up to the olerk's desk t
I and read. The memorial was In be- L
Shalt of Kellogg, and was published Cl
in the Coeugraioa.l BcRtnr on the 13th tI
inst. It reeited tat Kellogg was the o
rightful Senator, sad that the State ai
was now Demoeratie because of bal. d
Slot box stumlng, terrorism and mt ou
der. The ed RiBlver and North Lon- o
I slana parishes were denounced oin
violent terms, and the Democratic t
members of the Legislature from P
those sections were chared with
I holding their seats by fraud, oprete.
Ssloa candl violeace. The Generald s. -
saembly itself was obharged with being
ocomposd os men who had aided iu
suppressing the voice of the people. d
and whbo held their seats in defies
of decency, law and order.
As soon a the memorial was read
Mr. Coearrove rose and said that the
I charges contadned thereina, refaeted
I upon the character digity and bon. be
or of thbe Hose. Be senat up to the or
desk and read the passage against te
wichb he protested, and moved that
the offending mem brs e declared of
in contempt of the Hose, and te
bCroaCht before the bar in order to
purge themselves. Messers. Oden

ber o bthe House, who had sig.ad d
the memoral, aine In all, were ar. t
raigned to~aswer. i,
Their statements were, with one Qt
exception, to the effect that the me
morial had been presented to them
by the notorious I I. Soner, Kel
logg's agnet, who had reprsented to fo
them that it only contained a denial
of the statement made by a naewspa
per hsfthe l .bilean members had O
voted for the at reolution whiob h
recently pased the General Assesm H.
bly calling upon the United States m
Senate to oust Kellogg. As they O
had not voted for the resolutionln bil
question, they had no hesitation nla mi
offering their signatures to the do. of
ument. They also stated that if they rh
had known the real contents of the
memorial they could not have been
indoued to sin it, as its statements
were false. ome of the colored
membes stated that they had a
great elue'ace to sig, eyen upona

Bulow, of Assumption. Biss thi

's The Sabine nlda comes thus at the
s VrNotDIroa local about that wagon's
te somersault, on Second street in this
d city, week before last:
n* Oome now, neighbor! that won't
y begin to do. That wagso never came
e from Sabine for two very conclusive
reasons.
Firstly-Our boys are too good
drivers to upset a wagon whethet
they were drunk or sober.
Secondly-They never "imbibe too
' much bee zine."
1e And we can't let your slander of
"the free State of Sabine" pass un
noticed. We are no longer free, but
hold to the law -all except to the
y game law. We were not there but
we will bet treats with the VINDICA
TOR local that that wagon belonged
is on the Kisatchie in Natchitoches
e parish. Letjustie be done though
the heavens fall.
o. This local wasn't well informed on
1 the subject. Yet while he may ex.
claim "Peccavi," he files peremptory
o exception to portions of the above.
Glad to hear, however, that the Sa.
1e bie "natives" are both good team
I sters, and earnest supporters of the
temperance cause. We forgot also
t that 8shbine, under a Demooratic
State government, has dropped its
d sovereignty, and has wheeled into line
g as an unit in the cause of throttling
the toes to the peace, prosperity,
k wealth and happiness of fair Louis
I, lana.
ir But, say, don't you cast "inelnava
Stions" as Sam Weller would say,
. against the fair name and fame of
d our Kisatchle friends. Why, man
alive, they are the muscles, the bone
d and sinew of the parish, (not except
4 ing other localities). Those sturdy
- Democrats only leave their homes to
n vote, and rally when the call is made
for their services. Don't slander
I them. Here's our paw-shake.
t Those elected to office don't care a
i continental for their commissions,
e at least many have not yet called for
t them. Time is nearly up. Officers
e elect can secure their documents by
calling on George W. Kearney, Re.
* corder, who impatiently awaits their
o visits.
t We acknowledge the receipt of the
if Franklin Sus, Nos. I and 2, under the
f editorial management of W. P. Pow
er, F-q., who has succeeded its
P former editor Lewis W. Zine. The
San as of yore, proposes to advocate
pure and unadulterated Democracy.
We wish it every euccess, and feel
well assured that it will do battle
right royally, for the cause it has l
