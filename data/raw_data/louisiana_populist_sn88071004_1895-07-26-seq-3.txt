Mr. Jones weiit out in a compua
ny of volunteers fromn Winn ,ari.-.h
serviag Jeff Davis four years. At
some later period, he served four
years on the Police Jury of that
parish.
Mr. Jones has alway- heci a
leader in f:irm r.nd labor organiza
tions. He was master of his sub
ordinate Grange, and master of the,
Grant parish Pomona Grange. and
a member of the Louisiana State

liance, where be was placed on its
Executive Commnttee for three
consecutive terms, once a.: it,
chairman, and is now a memnter.
Mr. Jones was a consistent and
life-long Democrat until 1,91.
when, with many others, he lccamie
disgustel with the hollow preten
see of reform in that pIrty, and
left it to organize the People'a par
ty. He was a member of the State
Alliance from this parish at Lafay
ette, and was one of the "famous
twenty-two" who fought the dlick

and in 1892, its nominee for State
Senator, receiving a large majority
of the votes cast in this parish.
For many years Mr. Jones has
been a leading member of the
church, and is a conscientious
christian gentleman. He is well
qualified to fill the office which his
may friends have urged him to
seek. More than fitty letters and
imsany personal solicitations finally
induced him to make the race.

Now hit'e i.- h¢ prte'li,'tio.as is
to the resit of 1!:V I)enrocratic and
Republican N:atlonal Convc:enio:s.
The Republicans ar, ;omn! to :,
straight for sound money -I j:l.
gold standard. The l)emo.:rats are
either zoing to have a bolt in their
convention or are going to plt in a
plank in the platform. as Kentu !ckv
did, that me.ins nothing. The
Democrats of Mississippi arc tree
silver; Alabama sound money :
Tennessee free silver; Kentucky
sound money; Ohio, and especial
ly Cincinnatti, silver ; Pennsylva
nia silver, and I have not formed
any opinion yet as to what New
York will be. Anyway, the rank
and tile are against Cleveland. I
find some men who claim that they
were once free rilver, but now are
in favor of the single standard. I
have met a great many men fromn
different States who have been to
Boston to the Christian Endeavor
Society, and I find that a great ma
rity of the men that I have met
rom the following States are in
favor of free silver, besides the
States that I mentioned : Virginia,
Georgia, South Carolina, Missouri
and Illinois. Single standard peo
ple are from Indiana, West Virgin
ia, North Carolina, Kentucky and
Maryland. But you must remem
ber that a great many of these peo
ple have never read over the mat
ter.
1 predict that the People's party
will be the only National party
that will in 1896, come out un
equivocally for the free and unlim
ited coinage of silver. So from
what I have seen, I don't think it
would be good policy for our peo
ple to go too far with the free alver
people, for the reason that I r.im
satisfied that the I)emocrutic party
i onevention i. not going to en
'a_
du,:-ct" 16 t, 1 plink. ,.ni then tie
fri' silver people of the Sotth and
I A'e.t ~ il! h:';, to either coie to
I:- or swallow the :single standard
for nothing: it: the word Dmcranor!
iL,:t there will l, numbers of brave
L' and noble mef it:at will not follow
ran emp li)ty name, which now. along
a ll lzoxl and honestt men is held in
j contemllpt.

Atl Washingtmn 1:M, then came on

I the Hudson, saw where Maj. Andre

c be met Arnold on, above Tarry
I town, and near Tarrytown where
he was captured, and the monu
went that now stands on the spot
[ where he was executed; saw
i Washington's headquarters at New
Sburg, on the Hudson, where the
r army was quartered in 1781, '82,
- and part of S3. Saw West Point
t nestled in among the mountains,
I where our boys are educated for
e military purposes. I will say as
Washington Irving said, that the
i Hudson is the grandest river on
earth.
