We call special attention to the
announcement of "The Black Dia

where in this issue. This an am;i
telur comlpaiiy ot local talcnt and
deserves the liberal patronage of
all lovers of home enterprises.
This is not a travelling fake that
gets your money and is gone, but
it depends for success solely on
merit.

PERSONAL IENTION.
Mr. J. 0. Tanner of Ward 3 called on

of Natchitoehes' oldest and most sue
cessful farmers.
Mr. W. H. Latham and his friend,
Mr. A. S. Jackson of this parish, but
near Montgomery, paid us a pleasant
call this week.
Mr. F. L. Grappe, of Grappes Bluff
was in town this week attenifng court
asa witness.
An Elastic Currency.
This term, made odious by the
plutocratic press when the St.
Louis convention formulated a fi
nancial policy which would have
saved the country from its present
condition, is again made promi
nent by these same papers in com
mendation of the president's latest
craze.
Mr: Cleveland has gone mad
now and wants an "elastic" cur
rency.
But there is method in his mad
ness; a deep and sinister purpose.
That an elastic currency (fitting
and adjusting itself to the coun
try's deeds and giving the people a
volume of money sufficient at all
times to meet the requirements of
trade), is the thing needed above
all others at the present time ,no
one will deny. The St. Louis
platform provided for such a cur
rency; the demand was re-iterated at
the the Ocala convention and forms
one of the basic demands of the
populist platform. The'sub-treas
ury plan was recommended to be
discussed, and that or "something
better" asked to be adopted.
But it was "visionary." "Un
constitutional.-". The offspring of
the diseased brain of impractica
ble cranks. The only man who
condescended to submit "some
thing better" was Farmer John B.
Gordon, who proposed his mam
moth warehouse on the coast,
which somehow became mixed up
and buried unmler the ruins of the
"last days of the Confederacy," and
the "something better" has lain
dormant till the president is spurr
ed by the bankers.
But now, after having snucceeded
in the destruction of silver as a
money metal be comes forward
and admitting by inference that the
populist. were right from the frst,
he proposes that "something bet
ter,"
The trouble with the president's
plan is that, like his contraction
echeme it works exactly the wrong
way. The plan be proposes would
indeed make our currency elatic,
bat the strings would be placed in
the hds of the blkers and gold
bugs; and these tender hyena who
ftstrn on the misery of others
acould be depended upon to eontract
the volume when the great staples
a the country am to b thrown oa
the marketuand then expad it to
make the producer pay infation
prices till he could m e another
mop to acrifee in the next season
at contrtion.
The mb-treasury or "something
beter;" but the banker's plsa sb
alttad through Mr. Cleveland is

Ir- Rmlved, that this con

2nd. Resolved, that the only
requisite for membership in the
Cotton Growers Association shall
be some occupation or visible
me.a(ns of support connecttel with,
or 4dependent upon the planting of
cotton, and that all nimemlers olli
gate themselves to 1b governed hy
the laws and regulations of said
Association.
3rd. Resolved, that no person
can become a member or remain a
member of this association who is
or may become a member or an
employee of any trust, combine or
monololy, whose interest is inimi
cable to that of the Cotton Grow
ers Association.
4th. Resolved, that said asso
ciation appoint four (4) delegates
to represent this parish in the Cot
ton I lanters Convention to be held
at Jackson, Miss., in January 1595.
5th. Resolved, that delegates
be instructed to do all in their pow
er to induce the said Cotton Plant
ers Convention to abandon the
planting of cotton until a contract
can be made through the authoriz
ed officials of said convention, for
a stipulated amount of cotton at a
price that may be deemed sufficient
for a profit.
6th. Resolved, that it is the
unanimous opinion of this con
vention that cotton cannot be pro
duced profitably for a series of
years, for less than 10 cents a
pound, "middling."
7th. Resolved further, that af
ter the Cotton ( rowers Associa
tion has been organized through
out the cotton beIlt, that we advise
every planter to at once purchase
as many bales of cotton on future
delivery as he produced the preced
ing year, reserving a reasonable
amount to cover any subsequent
decline that may be forced.
8th. Resoved turther, that plant
ers and merchants; in lieu of ad
vancing to parties to enable them
to produce cotton for the year
1895, that they advance their cus
tomers the necessary amount to
buy the number of bales their cus
tomers propose to make, condition
ed upon the agreement that said
customers and laborers plant no
cotton for the year 1805, without
contract or stipulation referred to
above.
These resolutions were reported
favorably to the Cotton Growers
Association held here last week, by
the committee on resolutions, but
atter slight discussion were laid
aside to await- the action of the
National meeting to be held at
Jackson, Miss., in January next.
The resolutions are a combina
tion of two plans. The 1st to the
6th inclusive is the plan of Mr.
S. E. Russ, Sr., of Allen, P. O.,
this parish, while the 7th and 8th
covers the plan of E. J. Gamble
of this city. Both gentlemen are
planters and practical business
men, and their plans deserve a
great deal more attention than the
fine-spun theories of those who ee
interested in giving the farmers ad
vice. We will discuss these plans
elsewhere in this issue.
GIVE US SOME HONESTY.
The people of Lonisiana should
make it the prime issue of the next
campaign to combine tor pure and
honest elections in this state, aside
from any minor or local differences
that may exist among them. It is
time for this thing to te done. For
years theb citizens of Louisiana, and
we think our state no worse than
many othersj that always send up
large majorities for one party, have
been wallowing in the dirtiest po
litical oesspool; that to talk to
some of them about clean things
in this line ~is almost as barren of
good results as to request a hide
bound sectarian to change his
religion, but we will depend upnsu
the sober, better jadgment of a
high grade of citiztnship to take
up the matter and carry it to the
sncess it deserves which, in our
opinion, is the most important
subject now before the people.
Party names have played out.
Everything in the politieal line has
dissolved itself down to plain busi
oess proportions, with the excep
tiona of the pating shadow that
faded before the demands of the
Amerlean people a few weeks ago,
and which must fhrther disappear
to give place, as it were, to those
measres that must either raise
the peopleefour eounty to a lofty
eitimahip or settle them down,
oa the ether aud, to the same lev
el of rottuem which has pre
vailed in Lousiaa ter twenty
It aheli be the dnty of every
mn to leaid his eforts toward
purriyilag our politics in the fiture,
even if they have failed to do this
in the past. The record of our
State in the past and previous;
elections show the black marks of
fraud from one end to the other,
and we think that our political af
fairs should be made td take a
bath and otherwise go through the
process of purification, to the end
that people who hold office should
be the true servants of the public
and not the henchmen and scape
goats of a clique of miserable bosses,
whose business it is to plunder the I
public and saddle uplon the people
measures of disgrace--things that
already make us smell bad in the
nostrils of honesty.
Whatever combination is neces
sary among the white people of
any party to join together and set
up a pure government, should be
done. When that is acconmplished 1
it might be time to split uIpon de
tails and small issues but the main
project now should be honesty in
politics as well as that which gov
erns private and business transac
tions.
Our state has a record in anoth
er line, apart from that, which is
impossible to flourish in any other
in the union. It is that the men
who have power can accompldish
the most intense wrongs against
the public or individuals, and es
cape any punishment whatever,
while those who are not backed by
and kind of business or political
machinery to be punished for do
ing that which is right, just and
honest. For instance, if one man
should point out the existing evils
and the debauchery of right that
exists anywhere in Louisiana--if
it is specified and backed by evi
dence implicating any of the high
priests in politics, it would not be
long before he was furnished with
an excursion ticket to the cemete
ry. These qualities must pass
away and give place to honesty
without taint or trickery.-Atta
kapas Vindicator.
The Cincinnati Price Current es
timates that already 40,000,000
bushels of wheat have been fed to
animals and that from 60,000,000
to 75,000,000 bushels are likely to
be so fed from the present crop. 4
The weekly packing of hogs for
the first week in November amount
ed to 325,000 against 105.000 in
the corresponding week of last
year.
Danger, Damage, Destrection.

We will write up policies for you
and thereby relieve your mind
