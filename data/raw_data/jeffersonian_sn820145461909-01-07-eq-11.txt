A Fell? Words to Workers
and 'Reformers
A vote cast for the present Repub
lican party means a vote to perpet
uate the present system of aristocrat
ic government.
A vote cast for the present so
called Democratic paitty means a,
vote to perpetuate the present sys
tem of aristocratic government.
A vote for Watson and Williams
and the declaration of principles as
set forth in the Populist platform
means a vote to change from a gov
ernment of, for, and by the aristo
crats to a government of, for, and
by the people. Or, in other words, a
return to Jeffersonian Democracy.
While a large number voted to per
petuate government by the aristocracy
on the 3rd by voting for Bryan and
Kern, yet a much larger number vot
ed for the same thing by voting for
Taft and Sherman. On the other
hand comparatively few voted for the
much-needed change. So there you
are —no better off than before.
A division of the reform element
into a half dozen (more or less) par
ties means a perpetuation of the
present system of aristocratic govern
ment; so there you are again! You
couldn’t please the aristocracy better
than to divide up into sects and par
ties and thus scatter your votes.
Well, then, what can we do to bring
about the much-needed change?
Consolidate the entire reform and
labor vote in 1912 and the victory
will be won —“just as easy as fall
ing off of a log”! Don’t you believe
it? I do. Many voters, no doubt,
give as their reason for not voting
for Watson and Williams the fact
that they had no hope of their elec
tion. This betrays a great lack of
sincerity on their own part, as well
as also a great lack of confidence in
the masses of would-be reformers.
Others say they were afraid to
make a change of administration,
such for instance, as would have tak
en place in the event of Bryan’s elec
tion and therefore they voted for
Taft. Afraid of what? The money
powers, of course!
Oh, what cringing! What cowards
we mortals be! What bowing down
to “the powers that be”! What a
surrendering of principle to “the
captains of high finance”!
Just to think, of the time as now
here when American “freemen” (?)
are AFRAID to vote their senti
ments! This betrays the fact that
they themselves KNOW that they
are NOT free American citizens!
Tt furthermore betrays the fact
that they had little or no confidence
in Bryan as a savior, or his so-called
Democratic party as a redeemer.
Talk about labor organizations and
farmers’ unions, with the view of
bringing the capitalistic trusts and
combines, which but represent the
money powers, to terms of betterment
to the masses! What’s the use?
That is, so long as the different trades
organize so many different fraterni
ties. each in its own interest, and
without due regard for the well-being
of other workers.
All laborers, including fanners, are
Jeffersonian
already brothers in the world of
work. Therefore each one should re
gard himself as being his “brother’s
keeper.” That principle carried out
to the letter and in its true spirit
would produce one “Brotherhood of
Workers,” and at the same time do
away with the many “brotherhoods,”
as at present, thus “unifying” the in
terests of all workers. But even this
will not avail until the workers thus
united better their condition by
means of the ballot. They must al
so “go into politics,” as a unit, and
vote only one ticket. Aren’t the
trusts and combines “in politics”?
So you must “fight the devil with
fire” by going into politics too, as a
united whole, and that to “stay in”
until you whip the fight. “United
we Stand,” is fine in theory? Yes,
but so is “Divided We Fall”! The
theory is all right, in its place, but
it amounts to nothing if it is not
carried out in practice. THE PLACE
TO PRACTICE IT IS AT THE BAL
LOT BOX.
Let all workers and reformers thus
unite and in one solid phalanx, march
to the polls in 1912 and restore this
government to its rightful owners—
the people—and then, but not till
then, we will have a government “of
the people, for the people, and by the
people,” not only in theory, but also
in practice.

TONSORIAL TALE.
“By Jove! Karl,” said Bentley,
as the barber rubbed the top of his
head, “that feels mighty good, I can
tell you. The man who invented mas
sage was not only a genius, but a
benefactor to the whole human race.
They ought to put up a statue to him.
There’s nothing like it when a fellow
feels seedy. There’s only one trou
ble about it.”
“Vot iss it?” asked Karl, hoping
that perhaps he might overcome the
difficulty.
“Why, it’s all on the outside,”
said Bentley. “If there were only
some apparatus that would enable
you to get inside a fellow’s head and
clear out the pains of the morning
after, what a blessing it would be.”
“Veil,” said Karl, “I t’nk that
maybe some day dose vacuum-cleaner
fellers vill do dot already yet. Vot?”
