also in that congregation a family of
three or four white children whose
mother was a whore. There was no
hulabaloo raised over those poor bas
tard children, they furnished no
“God-sent” opportunity; people shed
no tears over them; no goodly sum
was raised for them; no arms were
thrown around them; no homes open
en to them. The college doors closed
against them. Foreign Missions?
Many of our poor children do not
go to church, and why? Because
they wear no patent-leather shoes, no
cotton basket hats, no silk dresses,
put no dollars in the collection, play
no whist, give no “hay rides” on
moonlight nights. But Foreign Mis
sions must continue! Show me any
religion in this: read out of the Bible
any place where Christ ignored and
shunned this class of people.

Things, politically, look dark to
me, and growing darker. May be as
I grow older I become more pessi
mistic. May be we are in the middle
of the clover field grazing on the
luxuriant fruit in full bloom and ac
tually doing so well that we can’t
appreciate a good thing when it
strikes us! But when Mr. Kirby, the
successor of Mr. Van-something-or
other, gets through with the laboring
element we will probably be anxious
to accept the few crumbs that the
lords scatter among us.
Seriously, though, what is the la
boring element going to do, any how?
In my mind the one and only thing
that will give all of us weaker
brothers a chance to make a respect
able living is to limit the accumula
tion of unnecessary wealth. Saw off,
rt least, the sharp points of the horns
before putting him in with the de
horned.
When a man gets all and more
than he and all of his progeny can
spend or squander he ought to be
choked off. Put a tax on wealth so
that when it gets to a certain place
it will take all of it.
Say, have you heard from Bryan
lately? I believe Aldrich has him
put away somewhere.

WILL SOME VET. ANSWER THIS?
Dublin, Ga., June 24, 1909.
Dear Sir: —Will you state in your
Jeffersonian Magazine and Weekly
the truth about the battle on Look
out Mountain, near Chattanooga,
Tenn.? I was in the Virginia army;
I was with some of the Western army
on Lookout Mountain, those that
were there at the last, and they told
me that not a gun was fired up there,
that they had to fall back from there,
as the Yankees were flanking the
mountain, to keep from being cap
tured, and a bigger lie was never told
ny the Yankee than the battle above
the clouds, and the lying inscription
upon those stones, unless it was about
Andersonville Prison, Ga.
Now I don't doubt these old com
rades for they ought to know, but I
'Jeffersonian
would like to hear from you. It will
be interesting reading for your pa
trons. Will you please state in full?
Confederate soldier,
G. W. JENKINS.

OUR “TOM WATSON” KNIVES.
These knives are made especially
for the Jeffersonians. They are
packed and mailed out by the manu
facturers, and about ten days will
usually elapse from the time the or
der was mailed to us until the sub
scriber receives his knife. We make
this statement so that you will not
expect to receive the knife by return
mail. Since we started to offer the
“Tom Watson” knife as a premium
we have kept the factory busy; and,
in fact, for a time they could hardly
keep up with the demand. We want
at least 100,000 people to be carrying
these knives around with them, and
we earnestly request every sub
scriber who receives one of these
knives to show it to all his friends
and acquaintances and tell them how
they can get one free.
My Dear Mr. Watson: —As Capt.
Thadgill and I take your Weekly and
Monthly “Jeffersonian,” and both
believe you will tell us the truth, I
write for information.
What has been the Democratic
party’s policy on the Tariff Question?
The Bailey partisans say he (Bailey)
is right by voting with the Republi
cans on the Tariff question, and that
has always been the policy of the
Democratic party on the Tariff ques
tion.
Culoerson and twelve others voted
just opposite to Bailey on the Tariff,
so kindly enlighten us on this sub
ject as we want to know which is
correct.
I am an original Populist ard
stand by that party today, but for the
want of an organization of the Popu
list party have voted the Democratic
ticket rather than to vote with the
Republicans, but can see no differ
ence whatever if Bailey is correct.
I would not vote with him on any
question at any time or in no way in
the least approve or countenance
anything he advocated.
Please answer in Weekly Jeffer
sonian; put me right on the Tariff
question and national questions now
before the ppople.
If not too much trouble kindly
write me personally in reference to
the above query.
Respectfully your friend,
D. C. JONES, M. D.
Cameron, Texas.
(Answer: Bailey is wrong and
Culberson is right, but Culberson
himself went astray in voting for a
duty on hides.)

How He Got Rid
of Consumption
Remarkable Rescue of Prominent In
diana Man. A Matter of Life-and-
Death Interest to All Throat
and Lung Sufferers
For Benefit of Jeffersonian Headers, He
Tells How He Cured Himself at
Home—Costs Nothing; to Try.
“I think I owe it to all sufferers of
lung and throat trouble and consump
tion to tell them some mighty good
news, a sure way to cure themselves
right at home with little trouble,” said
E. S. Stroh, of Angola, Ind., yesterday,
as he passed through.
“Coming from me, probably, some
people might doubt this, but let me tell
you,” he said, as his 66-year-old face
flushed with a resurrected, youthful
smile, “over two years ago I was a
weazened-up wreck, a consumptive at
63. Three lung specialists passed me
up. Every day I would cough up about
a pint. I had chills and fever every
afternoon. I could hardly eat, even the
plainest food, coughed nearly all night,
and was down to 137 pounds when I
hit on the cure. Well, you see me now.
I weigh 166 pounds, frisky as a boy at
66, can do a big day’s work, and eat
like a prince.
“Now I am not trying to boost any
body, but I must give credit where
credit is due. Dr. J. Lawrence Hill,
499 Hill Building, Jackson, Mich., the
well known lung specialist of America
and probably so far the only success
ful one, cured me. That was two years
ago. I have just had my lungs ex
amined again and there is no trace of
consumption nor danger of its return
ing. Dr. Hill makes a specialty of
treating throat and lung sufferers at a
distance who have not the means of
visiting his office personally. That’s
the way he cured me, and I know of
many others who had one foot in the
grave almost, brought back to life by
what he calls his Rational Treatment.
It certainly is a wonder.
“I wish every reader of your paper
who has weak lungs, catarrh of the
bronchial tubes or catarrh in any form,
chronic bronchitis, asthma, chronic
hacking cough, loss of flesh, night
sweats, hemorrhages, soreness or pain
in the chest or under the shoulder
blades or any other deadly symptom of
consumption, to send to Dr. Hill for his
trial package. This treatment checks
at once further progress of the dis
ease, develops atrophied cell tissues
and brings on new resisting power, ap
petite, flesh and good health.” Fill out
the coupon below and mail today.
Trial Treatment Package Coupon
Dr. J. Lawrence Hill,
400 Hill Bldg., Jackson, Mich.
I am suffering from throat and
lung trouble, so please send me your
large trial package in plain, sealed
wrapper, that I may try it and see
for myself if it will do what you
claim it will. I enclose 20c to help
pay for packing, etc., and as an evi
dence that I am not sending for the
trial package out of idle curiosity.
