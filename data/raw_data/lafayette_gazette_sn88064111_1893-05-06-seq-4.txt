..AT BE PRESERVED.
The purity of the ballot box must
'iaq preserved at all &hazards; our
constitutional liberties depend upon
its preservation from all encroach
ments that has a tendency to weak
e!aor place in jeopardy its sacred
': as, and no punishment, in our
,$dgment, can be too severe for
those who would use it illegally.
In the last municipal election, we
understand, two tickets folded to
.geter were taken from the box dur
ing the count, and the commission
ers doubtless considering their func
-tions purely ministerial counted
both. Again, it is alleged, that at
feast two illegal votes were cast.
The Gazette cares not to enter
,into a long disquisition upon the
" .normity of the offense of illegal
voting, but wishes to be placed on
.jsecord as entertaining the hope that
any one convicted of such infrac
tions be given the full penalty of the
law, so that he may have ample
time to ruminate over the evil of
jhis .ways, and trust he will learn
that the ballot-box is the palladium
of our liberties, and that desecrat
ing hands must not be laid upon it.
It is an outrageous shame the
snanner in which the Southern Paci
fc railroad officials treat the people
of. St. Martinsville. The policy
adopted of compelling people to
wait at Cade, where there are no
conveniences, not even a sitting
room, over an hour, must tend to
mnot only divert people, but trade
from the town. The people of the
trown should get together and pro
test vigorously against the contin
suance of the present inconvenient
order of things, and keep everlast
ingly kicking until the evil disap
pears.
HroME READING.
Teach the boys and girls to read
newspapers-not sensational, trashy
abut plain spoken papers. It
ill do them more good than can be
t&i>ted. It will give them food
i' ght. It will make them in
~j"y. i . It will cultivate a taste
for more extensive reading. It will
•case them to love home better.
It will make their intellect keener
and their hearts happier, purer and
wetter. Then they should also be
supplied with first class magazines
and good books. Such opportuni
ties would be worth more to them
than mints of gold. By all means
cultivate a taste for reading among
the children; and a good local pa
per is the best to begin with, as the
children can read about things that
pr; familiar to them about their
town and country, and con
cerning men and things of which
they have personal knowledge.
From this beginning they stand
pmong the most intelligent people
ff the land.
ROBERT MARTIN ESQ.
The Gazette was pleased to learn
}rcently, that Mr. Robert Martin,
pk St. Martinsville, is an applicant
for the position of Naval Officer at
the port of New Orleans, and judg
ing from the names of those endor
sing his claims his chances may be
ponsidered very good.
We know Mr. Martin to be a gen
tl.man of fine legal attainments; a
sagacious financier; thoroughly up
yight in his relations with his fellow
gpen; and possessed of every requi
pite $p perform the duties pertaining
tg thg pPice. to which he aspires, in
pp gptirely satisfactory manner to
the general government.
The Gazette wishes him good
-luck.
A hAPPY TO IV'N..
There is a town in Bavaria, on
the river Main, by the name of
Klingenberg, which would be the
-ep-p plce for tax resisters to move
-O, for taxes of all kinds, State and
unaicipal, are absolutely unknown
there. To be a citizen of Klinber
ger is pot only an honor, but profit
P!,l puf PIarily. The town is the
lucky possessor of some quaries
:hat have lately become very valua
sle and which return it such rich
venues as to make tdxes altogether
.ry end to leavea hand
S.lance in the village treasury
r. This balance is divided

A few week~ ago, the burghers of
KllHgeaberg ti ught'Sii necessary to
eret a brigde iver the~ rier Main.
It was an expensive tiuxut costing
$5o,ooo, but not a cent of tax had
to be assessed to build it. The
money was paid out by the town,
without the citizens contributing a
cent, and in order that the latter
might feel happy over the event, a
a considerable amount of money
was divided among them, children
as well as adults.
A CALL.
Prof. Knapp has called the Sugar
Cane and -Rice Growers Convention
for the Third Congressional District
to assemble in New Iberia, on June
Toth. Up to date, our people have
taken but little interest in this move
as the date of the convention had
not been published.
This convention is to formulate
a plan of action and a mode of pro
cedure, to protect the great sugar
interest of Louisiana. It will tabu
late a statement of the growth of
sugar under the bounty system; ol
its great ramifications, of the numbe
of persons interested in its culture,
the capital involved, the quantity
and cost of machinery that is pur
chased from the North and which
issued in its production, of the
stock that is bought and raised and
generally of the great importance
of the industry.
"If the bounty is repealed and
the tax is taken off sugar the indus
try in this State will be ruined. It
is unnecessary to say that thousands
of our people are interested in this
matter, and that some measure of
protection is necessary to maintaim
and to foster the industry.
"The plans of the promoters of
the convention look to the sending
of a committee of prominent
planters, well versed i: all that per
tains to the culture, development
and importance, to Washington
when Congress meets to present our
statement and to urge our claims
for protection of some kind. The
committe will resist the repeal
of the bounty or insist upon the
substitution of a revenue tariff.
Is is believed that the statement
that is to be issued will attract the
attention of Northern manufac
turers and business men to the im
portance and wide ramifications of
the sugar industry and that North
ern business assistance will be ob
tained.
All sugar planters, as well as rice
planters, are invited to be present
at the meeting, which is to be abso
lutely non-political in character,
and which Prof. Knapp says is sole
ly for the good of the State and its
most important industry.-Daily
Iberian.
A RAILROAD BUILT FOT -.
An Austin (Texas) letter says that
from South Texas came a man who
built 6oo miles of railroad with a
$5 bill and faith, and the bill was a
borrowed one. He moved up from
Corpus Cristi to San Antonio with
all his possessions heaped up on a
two-wheeled cart. He got a char
ter to build a railroad from San An
tonio to Aransas. He graded a
mile of it, throwing a good deal
more than one shovel of dirt with
his own hands.
The receiver of another road
loaned this indefatigable builder
enough old rails for track. In the
distant part of the State was pur
chased an engine which had been
condemned six years before and
sent to the shops to be wrecked for
iron. Two old cars were picked
up somewhere else at a bargain.
And that old engine, drawing those
old cars, steamed into San Antonio.
On engine and cars inbold lettering
was painted in lamp-black: "S. and
A. P."
With one mile of old rail track
and with the equipment of the old
engine and the two old cars Uriah
Lott started the Aransas Pass sys
tem. There has been some tall fi
nanciering in the history of railroad
building in this country, but there
isn't anything which, for dazzling
pluck, quite approaches the
story of the building of this six
hundred miles of road in South
Texas.
To the one mile of track three
were added-three miles miles by a
dicker of some second-hand rails
which a street car company had
bought from a narrow guage com
pany. On this basis a credit trade
was made with a Pennsylvania roll
ing mill for ten miles of rails.
When they arrived there was n't
enough money in the treasury to
pay the freight.
BUt it waq POt somehow. Ten
piles of t(-ck gave the fpnp
~~a~ri ~ f as wlch built 5e
miles more, e bQWhe system grew
into its prsenits~ rtions. This
man who built the Aransas Pass sys
tem rode from San Antonio to Chi
cago a one critical period i his
enterprise, without a cent in\ his
pocket. He had transportation,
but he hadn't anything to buy food
and he went through hungry. .,
This road subsequently passed
into the hands of a receiver, and
was profitably operated until it be
came and embarrassing rival to the
Southern Pacific, and recently
passed under the control of this
company. It is to-day splendidly
equipped and handles a vast amount
of business between Houston and
San Antonio. The building of this
road, was, to say the least, a re
markable achievement.
IT OUGHT TO PAY.
Farming, like every other indus
dry, to be profitable, must be done
well, says an authority on the sub
ject. Lazy, slovenly men can be
found in all vocation, and they are
the men who never make a success in
any line, are always pessimists, and
can never see any good in doing any
thing well. There are plenty of
farmers, good men, too, if we are
to speak of them morally and so
cially, who are so loose in their bus
iness relations that they are always
a century behind the times.
Many husbandmen who have
started in life with nothing but am
bition and determination, while
others have failed with many supe
rior advantages in a financial way,
have made their fortune. It takes
brains to manage a farm right. A
farmer should make a study of the
adaptability of the soil which he
cultivates, always planting that
which the soil will produce best
without robbing it of its strength
and fertility. A little shrewd man
agement is often better than a year's
labor.
PUOBLIC ROADS.
Editor Lafayette Gasette:
On reading an article in your pa
per on Public Roads, I desire to
suggest a few thoughts on that sub
ject.
Should I ask, "do the people of
this country want better roads?" the
answer would be "yes." Then, if
they are needed and wanted the sub
ject should be agitated, for any
public move would receive opposi
tion from some source.
When thoroughly agitated, sub
mit it to the people and see if they
will be taxed to pay for making
these roads. If a man needs a thing
he should have it ; if he is very
anxious for a thing he will make an
effort to get it. The people of this
country need better roads and cross
ings; they should have them. Will
they make the effort?
I've never seen a county having
fine roads that got them free. They
cost money-heap ! But I have
never seen a country where such
roads exist that was not highly civil
ized, the communities dotted here
and there with schools and churches
-both potent factors in civilization.
Then, I have never seen a coun
try without good roads, where schools
and churches flourished as they
might under more favorable condi
tions.
Southern Louisiana is the best
country I know of to make good
roads at moderate cost. If the roads
were sixty feet wide, a ditch on eith
er side, and well graded, there
would be but liitle expense attached
afterward.
Are you in favor of better roads?
If not, why not, you old moss-back?
Cowsin Ben.
* A REAL BAD ANA "
We copy the subjoined from the
Chicago Blade, and if any of our
readers can recall the event and
know the details of this alleged in
cident, The Gazette would be
pleased to have them contribute
same to its columns:
"At Opelousas you may hear even
yet of a certain noted character
whom we will call La Bleun, whose
reign was not so long back but what
many men can still remember it.
La Bleu was a man of great stature,
a perfect shot with rifle or revolver,
and totally devoid of personal fear.
He had been known to shoot a ne
gro dead because the latter did not
take his hat off to him upon the
road. He rode about the country
and did as he liked. He married
any women he chose, and if the
wife of any man struck his fancy
he would impudently call and ask
for her.
Judge Martel, a man noted for his
courage and determination, had oc
casion to call a session of his court
for a certain day. LaBleu sent
word that court could not sit.
Judge Martel sent word that court
would sit iqt the same. La Bleu
returned hij compliments, and said
that if court did sit that day he
would be on head and would then
and there kill the judge presiding.
Judge Martel replied courteously
that he would be " t home on the
bench then and thgr9 Cnd would be
pleased to receive M. Igbleu's call.
When the day cme roun! court
did sit, and Judge IMIarte1 was on the
bench. La Bleu entered the court
room and walked boldly down in
front of the bench. A word and
his hands&• to-bhis weapon. At
that bangl bangl-two
bullets stru is and hi fell deadr
Judge Marte bad men posted to up=
hold the dignity of the law. They
obeyed 'teir instructions to the let
ter. This ended the La Bleu dy
nasty. Judge Martel is alive to
day.
[Judge Martel has been d
some six or seven years.-EdJ
CELESTIAL GOTHAAM.
The Chinese are essentially a lit
erary people. The poorest people
can read, keep accounts, and write
poetry. My old friend, the priest,
tells me that this is owing to a most
excellent compulsory education
law, repealed some years ago, but
the effects of which are still felt in
the flowery kingdom. When a boy
reached a certain age, he was
odliged to pass an examination,
prescribed by the government. If
he failed the first time; he was given
a year to study up in; failing in the
second examination, they chopped
off his head. As an incentive to
study, it was found most effective.
The result is that: the Chiness are,
as a people, a race of educated men.
It is not comforting to one's vanity
to feel that the bland heathen, who
hands you your neatly polished
collars and cufis at the laundry, is
inwardly despising you as an uncul
tured barbarian, who finds more en
joyment in a base-ball match, a
horse race, or a regatta than in a
trial of intellect. It is at these
poetical contests that this literary
tendency finds relief and expression.
Subjects are chosen, and
poems are written, ac
cording to the strictest rules of Chi
nese prosody. Prizes are awarded,
and the evening closes with music
and supper. When we remember
that these contests are among lau
drymen, cooks, restaurant waiters,
and others of that class, and then
contrast them with the recreations
indulged in by the corresponding
class of our own people, we are
tempted to ask with Truthful
James:
Is our civilization a failure ?
Or is the Caucasian played out?
-The Arena.
The Women of "Le Petit Paris."
ST. MarTNvni.zL, LA., April3o '93.
--Breathes there a man with soul so dead
who oan himself bath never mid.
My own. my sative laad.-
Some years ago, I will not say how many,
when I was filling my mind with some of
the beauties from the peas of Shakespeare,
Milton, Pope, Cowper, Burns, Byron and
Scott I stored away in the recesses of memo
ry the above quoted lines. Occasionally,
something transpires, or presents itself to
draw from the niches of the mind the treas
ured thoughts of others. Though the pow
er to originate besitiful and subline ideas
has been given to few, many have the capa
city to enjoy the creations of great minds.
Although my eyes did not first open in
this historic town on the Teche, I have been
here long enough to feel a certain amount
of pride and interest in everything that per
tains to its. attraction and welfare. Fate
has been impelling me from place to place
so long. I sometimes imagine that Death will
be at a loss to fad me when he gets ready
to take me to the mansion of eternal bliss.
But I am disgressing. I want to tell you
what surroundings suggested the patriotic
lines quoted above. It is not the even and
compact pavements; it is not the imposing
edifices; it is not the jingling bells of street
.cars nor the glare of electric lights of which
we are proud, for none of these are here;
but the rural attractions as seen in the um
brageous trees; in the sporting of the finny
tribe in the sluggish waters of the Teche;
in the lowing of the herd while wending its
way home at eve; in the cheering songs of
the mocking-bird whose warblings are heard
upon every house and tree-top. But su
perior to all these picturesque scenes may
be added beautiful and lovable women of
whom it may be said as Milton's described
Eve before her fall:
-Grace Is in every step.
teaven in her eye.
And I every gesture dignity and love."
When Charles Dudley Warner wrote of
our town as growing in nothing but age,
he must have been influenced by impressions
made on a rainy day, when the streets were
not decorated with our representatives of
"Heaven's last best gift to man." Though
she is growing old, she is, in her old age,
giving to the world more than her share of
pure and beautiful women; though the roofs
may be covered with moss and the dwellings
otherwise disfigured by the hand of time,
they shelter brighter intellects and nobler
characters than many towns of more pre
tentious claims. Nature in dispensing her
charms of person and manner to the women of
this place, has been most lavish. It they
are as good as they are beautiful, and if
their virtues are as varied as their beauty,
they have exhausted the catalogue of fe
male virtues, and their salvation is already
assured. Now, my fair readers, do not get
offended because the word ladies is not used,
for I have omitted it purposely, for the rea
son that the word woearen is a more exalted
appellation.
Our town possesses another rare feature
which I cannot pass unnoticed; although she
is dressed in the garb of extreme old age,
her oldest daughters-the old maids, if I
may so designate them, wear the bloom of
youth and the smile of contentment. If
there has been any other type of that fasti
dious sisterhood, they became disgusted with
the world and died early.
In contemptating the picture presented
by the other sex, an involuntary smile illu
mines the face; for it seems that Providence
has played a joke upon the boys. Now
young men, particularly those with an in
fant mustache and a mouth of wide domain,
do not imagine that you are not included
wi t the beoys But you are not to bluace orr
not being handsome Ip form and feature, for
I know you try to naeke yourselves captivat
ing; but fate i agaipst you. To pass in
spection you will have to go where there is
not much reflected light from the opposite
szex to dim your luster. Nratmure bolancs her
accounts fairly, for every previous gift is
-et somewhere in the book of life with a
worthless one; She sometimes seems part
tal in the distribution of her fevors, but I
presume they are dispenaed according to
some immutable law which our minds cea
not comprehend; but which, itf correctly un
derstood, would probably appear just.
oia, I am sorry for you, of but cannot
hgls I could probably be of service to
rm~ln the way of advice but I never offer
that, unsolicited. FsrLx.
