VEGE I
FOR CHILLS,.JAKE,.
FEVER and AGUE.
Tarboro. N. C I7e.
M. H. . Stva PF.s:
Dear Sir,-I feel very grateful for what your
valuble medecine, Vegetine, has dones in niy
family. I wish to express my thanks by intinorm
inu youte of the wo elrful cure of may non; als,,
to let yon know that Vegetine is tlhe beat tirlle
icine that I ever saw f:r Chills. Shlakes, Fever
and Ague. My sou was sick with measles iii
187 which left him with Hiijoint disease. eMy
son suffered a great deal of pain, all of the time;
the pai was so great he did nothing. bhit ry.
The doctors did not help him a pattlcle, he
gould not lift hi. foot from tile door, he could
not move without ruatehes. I read your adver.
tisement in the "Louisville Courier--Journal,'
that Vegetine was a great Blood Pnritier and
Blood food. I tried one bottle, which was a
great benefit. Be kept on with the medicine,
gradually galning. Be has taken eighteen hot.
tles in all, and he is eompletly restored to helth,
walking without crutches or cane. He is twen.
ty years of age. I have a younger son, fifteen
years oftas who il subject to Chills. When.
ever he feels one comming on, he comes In takes
a dose of Vegetine and that is the last of the
Chill. Vegetine leaves no bad effects upon syv.
tem like meet of the medicined recomended for
Chills. I Cheerfully recommend Vegetine for b
such complaints. I think it is the greatest
medicine in the world.
Respeetfully, MRS. J. W. LLOYD.
Vuoltili. ,-When the blood becomes lifeless
and stagnent, ether from change of weather or
of climate, want of exercise, regnlar diet. or
from any other cause, the Vegetine will renew
the blood; carry oft the purid humors, cleans the
stomach, regulates the bowels, and imparts a
tone of vigor to the whole body.
