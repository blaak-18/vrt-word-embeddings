“No unbiased person, after having seen how
the convention was run and heard much of the
talk, could come to any other conelusioh than
that the Independence party is being run and
conducted in the interest of the Republican
party,” said Joseph T. Marshall, sole Nebras
ka delegate to the Hearst Private Theatrical
Performance in Chicago recently.
“I have seen enough up to this
time to know that the convention
was packed and run by Walsh and
other men on Mr. Hearst’s pay
roll. It was packed and subject
to boss rule bv paid employes of
W. R. Hearst.”

“The conviction is inevitable
that th6 Independence party is
working in the interests of Taft.
The part I took in organizing
South Carolina was not on the un
derstanding of any such purpose.
Having lost faith in your move
ment, and having no desire to aid
in perpetuating a party that is not
serving the best interests of the
people, I beg herewith to tender
my resignation from the executive
committee,” writes Hon. J. Con
way Garlington, of Greenville, S.
€., to Charles A. Walsh.

In line with this is the following
from the New York World, which
says:
Supreme Court Justice Samuel
Seabury, generally recognized as
the strongest single figure in the
political movements headed by
William R. Hearst, and whose
forceful efforts contributed mate
rially to the large vote polled by
the Municipal Onwership League
and the Independence League in
1905 and 1906, has withdrawn from
the Independence party.
In a statement made to a report
er of The World yesterday in his
summer home at East Hampton, L.
1., Justice Seabury made clear
his reasons for the action he has
taken. Summarized, they are as
follows:
Seabury’s Reasons.
First —That there never has been a national
convention, which was so completely domi
nated by one man as the Independence party’s
recent convention at Chicago.
Second That regularly elected delegates
were denied admission to the convention and
other delegates were prevented by threats of

physical violence from expressing their views
in the convention.
Third —That a delegate who attempted to
present William J. Bryan’s name in the con
vention was grossly insulted and forcibly
ejected from the hall.
Fourth —That Mr. Hearst has come to re-

gard the vote polled by the Independence
League in 1905 and 1906 as a purely personal
asset to use for the promotion of his own
ambitions or to gratify desires for personal
revenge.
In addition to his statement, which he dic
tated to the reporter of The World, Jus
tice Seabury emphasized in a supplemental
conversation some of the principal causes of
his dissatisfaction with Mr. Hearst’s man
agement of the Independence party.
Justice Seabury was not a delegate to the
Independence party’s-convention. He and his
wife were on a tour of the Great Lakes and
were in Chicago at the time of the conven
tion and, because of his prominence in pre-
vious movements headed by Mr.
Hearst, he took a keen interest in
the doings of the convention. Jus
tice Seabury returned from hi?
Western trip last Thursday night
and went at once to his summer
home on the sand dunes at the
easternmost end of Long Island.
Since his return he has seen no
political leaders and does not ex
pect to see any, as his position on
the Supreme Court bench pre
cludes active personal work in the
Presidential campaign. He made
the statement to The World in
his capacity as a citizen and as
one who believes in the adoption
of certain principles by the gov
ernment. He said:
“In the history of American
politics there has never been a
national convention that was less
independent and which was so
completely dominated by one man
as the convention of the so-called
Independence party.
“Every element of independ
ence was ruthlessly stamped out.
“Regularly elected delegates
were denied admission to the con
vention; other delegates were in
timidated and by threats of phy
sical violence were prevented from
expressing their views in the con
vention.
“The delegates were denied
even the opportunity to vote upon
Mr. Bryan’s name. A delegate
who attempted to present Mr. Bry
an’s name was grossly insulted and
forcibly ejected from the conven
tion.
“Honest men may differ m
their opinion as to whether the In
dependence party should have
*- x
nominated Mr. Bryan, but no decent cit
izen can approve the methods which were
pursued in that convention.
“Independent men who joined the Inde
pendence League because they believed in the
principles it professed will doubtless leave it.
“These men will support the principles in
which they believe, even if they have to do so
outside of a political organization.
