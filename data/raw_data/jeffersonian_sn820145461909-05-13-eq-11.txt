THE OLD COMANCHE YELL.
A down the quaking winds it came
Much like a shrieking dart,
A ye'll that sent the rushing blood
Back on the pounding heart;
A whoop that set the nerves a-jump
With ague-shaking thrill,
And gave a man a coward’s heart
In spite of all his will.
Like scream of panther in the night
It wrought a chilling spell,
And even heroes’ blood ran cold
At that heart-freezing yell;
Because it took a demon’s voice
To force it on the air,
And hell itself has not a sound
fiendishness so rare.
It woke the hardy plainsman oft
From dreams of home and wife,
To seize his trusty winchester
And battle for his life;
Mid snorting ponies, whizzing shafts.
And rushes fierce and fell,
While through it all a demon’s voice
Was sounding in that yell.
The wagon train upon the plains,
Has often heard its doom
Loud sounded in the glare of day,
Or in the midnight gloom,
By that infernal screeching yell,
That meant destruction dire
By scalping knife and arrow swift,
Or brutal lust and fire.
It was the death Jknell of the weak,
It made the strong turn pale;
And many a soul that heard it first
Upon some lonely trail,
Went hence through horrid torturing.
The thought of which brings tears.
And while it felt the throes of death
That ye'll rang in its ears.
It wakes the echoes wild no more
Upon the boundless plains,
And but a few of riper years
Its horridness retains;
For on the scenes where once it rang
The light of safety beams,
And only old time plainsmen now
May hear it, in their dreams.
—Jake H. Harrison.
PAPER FROM COTTON STALKS.
Statements have been made repeat
edly by those conversant with the in
dustry that if the tariff be taken off
wood pulp or the paper made there
from, the paper-making industry will
be transferred from the United States
to Canada. But the announcement
from Atlanta, Ga., that a company
formed there will make commercial
paper from cotton stalks, gives hope
that the ultimate development of the
use of the cotton stalk for this pur-

pose may enable the Southern States
to more than supply the home de
mand for paper.
Experiments have been carried on
for some years to determine how to
utilize the fiber in the cotton plant for
paper-making. It has been demon
strated that one-third of the gross
weight of the cotton stalk is pure cel
lulose or fiber of tho best quality for
making all grades of print paper, and
to the 12,000,000 tons of cotton stalks
produced annually in the South the
country may well turn for a perma
nent supply of ia large portion of the
paper used.
One of the obstacles to the use of
the cotton stalk has been the cost of
the chemical treatment necessary to
make a pulp from it suitable for pa
per-making. Its adaptability has been
well understood, but the cost has in
terfered with its practical or exten
sive use. Recently it has been discov
ered that the by-product contained in
the chemical liquor after it has ac
complished the disintegration of the
cotton stalk can be treated in such a
way that it can be made into a ferti
lizer which can be used upon the cot
ton lands, and largely restore the fer
tility of those lands. The revenue re
ceived from the sale of this fertilizer
will reduce the difference of cost be
tween cotton-stalk and wood-pulp pa
per.
The 4,000,000 tons of cellulose or
pulp for paper-making that can be
obtained from the cotton crop of the
South would be a source of supply
greater in amount than is consumed
by all the paper manufacturers in the
United States at the present time.
The cotton stalk in the past has
been of no special value to the planter
or farmer producing the cotton. The
planter has had to destroy the cotton
stalks by burning them in order to
destroy the weevil. If this vast prod
uct can be utilized, as it now promises
to be, it will add untold millions of
dollars annually to that section of the
country which is now producing cot
ton; for inevitably the great industry
of paper-making, or quite a portion of
it, will be established within the
States producing cotton. —Washing-

USURY
The Anti-Usury League publishes a
book dealing with the injustice of in
terest. The book is called “Usury”. It
contains 300 pages, is neatly bound in
cloth, and is sent prepaid for one dol
lar. This book knocks the pegs from
inder the national banks It shows
their infamous origin, their grip and
their danger to the republic. It shows
the remedy for the social and industrial
evils which unpractical reformers are
seeking. It is not pessimistic, though
it treats of oppressive injustices; but
Is emphatically hopeful of the complete
victory over giant wrongs when the
new-old remedy here advocated is ap
plied. Whether you be a Christian or
a pagan, write for it to day. It will
make you a wiser citizen; it will give
you a higher conception of what true,
noble manhood should be. It will give
you a higher ideal for your own life,
and of the fraternal relations that
should prevail among men.
