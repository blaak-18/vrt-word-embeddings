Mr. Kruger has created a profound ie

the press does not otmnmnal its annoyanl

The inspired journail declare that it
was Germany'" desire to ituanate defl

be welcome, and therefore, the fact that
he omitted to comply with the strict
etiquette of the German ourt and di
ferred asking Emperor William for an
audience until he had reached the Belgor
German frontier, was eagerly setaed an
a reason for denying him an audience.
Mr. Kruger's reception at Cologue
was escoedingly enthusiastic so far as
the citizens were concerned. They had
planned a torchlight proceesion and sor
enades, but the police forbade both.
Mr. Kruger's dispatch to Coant You
Boelow, the imperial chancellor and to
the heads of the German states were
left unanswered. There is no doubt
that as late as Haturday foreign office
officials contemplated that Mr. Kruger
would be recteved in Berlin today.
