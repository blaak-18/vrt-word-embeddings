Attention.
MI. Hahn, State Supevisor of Regis
tration, has instructed the Assistant
Supervisors throughout the State to
reqnire the Clerks or Commissioners
of election to write
VOTED NOVEMBER 7TII, 1876,
on the Registration papers of every
person as they deposit their ballot.
This will prevent repeating.
During the storm of wind on Sat
urday last the splice of the Tilden pole
was blown off with the flag. On Mon
day Messrs. Hartman and Little low
ered the poll, re-spliced it, and the
Tilden and Hendricks flag now floats
triumphantly as ever.
Forward to Victory.
The returns are all in from the late
elections ; the result stands thus:
Democratic Indiana.
Democratic West Virginia.
Republican Ohio.
That settles the business.
Tilden was nominated upon the
presnml-tion that with the South and
New York he could be elected. Add
Indiana and the prestige of her vic
tory, and the election of a Democrat
ic President is assured.
BUT WE MUST WORK!
Ten days hence, fellow-citizens of
Natchitoches, and you grapple the

There has been so much talk in- d
dulged in since the beginning, by t
IRadlical officials about a fair election, Io
that we had begun to think that we 11
would have it, not fiom any love of f
fairness on the part of Radicals, but
f'o.i ear of consequences. Such a state ,
of facts as this of Natehitoclhes, di
would warrant tile belief that ourG
surmises about a fair election were
incorrect.
Be that as it may, we will still in- si
sist upon it-that all matters I' tain- P
ing to this election sh::Ill be fair and
above board, and to tlhat end the
whlite people of this parish have
"f- pledged themselves to hold to a stero,
m. personal accountability, all who en
ntil gage in swindling them of thleir rights
tas free men, and all those whom this
ion swindling is intended to benefit, mnay
rest assured that precious little good J
- will comie to them of it. This, we
beg all to remember, is no threat;
wgi- e know whereof we speak, for the
ant intelligent and virtuous whites do
e to not intend to submit to further spolia- t
nrs tion fiom the scoundrels of Radical
ismn who hiive heretofore robbed them.
', Peace is dear to all, but it will not be
cre- kept at the price of their rights and
lot. tliheir liberty.
Bill Tunnard goes into the "lash
at- ed back" business in the last half
olo sheet of the "slop pot." Bill ought
on- to tell the negroes how he introduced
ow-, the society of the "White Camelia"
the here, and how hlie swore to God lihe
onts would never vote for a "nigger" as
long as hlie lived. That would be in
teresting reading. Aind tlhen hlie could
intersperse it with the story of how be
lwas going to destroy tile Republican
p inting oftfice, the News, in 1867, and
how hlie guzzled Democratic whisky
and howled tile "gay old carpet-bag
ger "o' nights." Bill is a tfine spec
itnen of radicalism to bie sure.
After Tuesday, the 7th of Novem

Di find time to abuse such persons as
UG have heretofore helped those two
"miscreants" (N. Y. Tribune) "run"
the State, but who now desire to ren
re der such assistance as they can, to
ow help the people they so long, peisis
' tently and cruelly wronged.
e I We never have had, nor ~ ill we
ever have confidence in or respect
he for the utterances of an "Independ

- of conrse, those country sheets, such
1- as the Colfax Chronicle, and others
it we could name, that exist simply up
le on the crumbs of the Radical feast
ral thrown them as a price for silcnce
l when Goml knows it is dear at any
an price.
r- The Colfax Chroicle holds up its
tle dainty hands at the apostacy of Ward
and Flowers.
We would like to know upon what
authority that sheet speaks for the
Democrats of Griant parish.
il We happen to know that those who
ill fouyht Ward and Flowers at Collax
8- are not half as mad as the Clrnrmicle
e man, who was never there. We saw
men who stood the brount of that
king mnemorable battle talking to Ward
ho and Flowers on our steets, and they
al did not seem to be so much huffed as
itshi the Chronicle. Maj. Frank McGloin,
t to than whom no truer, °braver, more
sis hlionorable gentleman exists, told us
lsts that Ward and Flowers made their
de- explanations of the Colfax affair, and
their connection withl it, to Captains
iNash and Hoe, Mr. Tom Hic.nman,
rty the young Blanchard's and others,
ith who did a deal of fighting at that
the battle and they were -satisfied, and
we see no reason for the Chronicle to
im- get war-like.
The Chronicle, like a good many
more insignificent "smart Alexs," is
yrs, getting entirely too independent in
ards its dictation to the Democratic party.
suc The Democrats of Natchitoehes are
18 not defenders of Ward, or champions
of Kellogg, neither is the press,
tt an which is alone Cauthorized to speatk for
i- them, subsidised by a villainous print
ing law, but they are lovers of fair
hite play and insist on the originators,
Kellogg and Packard, bearinlg their
rote share of this "bloody Colfax Riot."
1 - Let the Chronicle tell the people of
cuse DeCline and Stockton, and their rape
llnot of the young lady in Grant parish.
Let it tell who Stockton is, anid where
id t he lie is to-day. Let it tell of the pack
and ed Julies by Packard, and the drilled
c te and crammed witnesss by Beckwith,
and then anId not until then, can it
pretend to champion the fighting
