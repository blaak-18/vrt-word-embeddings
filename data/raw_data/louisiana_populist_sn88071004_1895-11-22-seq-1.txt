e A WICKED POLICY.
HARRISON'S SYSTEM CARRIED
OUT BY CLEVELAND.
The 'Payng olut of Gold Onlyl Iwvhen the
Law Says Cole, I Costly, Curruptlng
and Degrading, and Presdent Cleve
land Knows It.
"' ulminated by Jeffcriou and i:;i
trated by Cleveland is good. Jefrer
'on wrote to Hlamilton in February,
179: -..I concur with you that the
unit must stand oa both metal!.
Mr. (leveland makes it stand on gold
alone. Jefferson falminated a doc
trine that the people, not tie banks
and officeholders, should rule. Mr.
(lecveland maintains that he alone
iiouild fulminate politics and rule the
people through money and public
plundering. Monroe illustrated
the doctrine of Jefferson by
declaring that no European power
should acquire territory and domin
ion on the western hemisphere. How
t does the acquiesence of President
Cleveland in British aggressions
everywhere illustrate that doctrine?
Jackson had the coinage laws of 1837
passed, which opened the mints to
both gold and silver upon terms of
exact equality. Cleveland allowed the
mints to remain open for the
coinage of gold, but clocdl them
against the coinage of silver. If
Ct leveland is a patriotic American
what words of opprobium would be
sufficient to condemn Jefferson, Mon
roe and Jackson, whose policy wasdi
4 rectly the opposite of nis Imperial
b Majesty from Buffalo. The inheri
tance of a bankrupt treasury from his
Republican predecessor is good, but
it would be better to tell the truth and
let the people know that the treas
d ury was bankrupted tt the joint ac
tion of Ilarrison and Clcveland. The
act of 1190 made it the duty of the
secretary of the treasury to coin
r sufficient of sliver bullion purchased
r under its provisions.to provide for the
redemption of the treasury nojes is
sued under that act. lHarrison re
fused to do this, but assured Euro
pean speculators that the treasury
a of the United States would be open to
? them if they would present obliga
- tions of the government and they
might draw out the gold without
limit, although such obligations were
payable in either gold or silver.
s Upon this assurance the Roths
f childs' combination undertook to
- obtain gold from the United States for
1 the purpose of funding the debt of
Austria, amounting to 2.,400.000,000
of bonds payable in silver, into Â£2,
- 800,a00,000 payable in gold alone.
SLDuring Harrison's administration this
Austrian syndicate commenced re
moving our gold, and when Cleveland
was inaugurated in March 1893 the sur
plus had been drawn down to the limit
of #100.000,000. Carlisle hesitated, but
thne courageous Cleveland declared
that if Europe wanted gold, although
the government had the option to pay
in silver, he would pay the gold alone
for the benefit of European specula
tors without regard to the interest of
the people cf the United Staies. Our
courageous president then joined in
the hue and cry that the government
was bankrupt and would remain so
until the purchasing clause of the
Sherman act could be repealed. By
the patronage and power which
he possessed, and by com
mercial press wilich the banks,
owned, coupled with the ir
resistible power of money, he forced
the repeal of the only law on the
statute book that recognized silver as
money, and limited tl,., standard
money of this country to. gold alone.
This is what the Pennsylvania Demo
crate call Jeffersonian Democracy.
But the declaration of the Pennsylva
nia convention that Cleveland has led
" the people out of the slough of
despondency to the high round
of substantial and increasing pros
perity," shows such ignorance of
the condition of the country or such
barefaced lylong, that ought to make a
rhinoceros blush. The conspiracy of
Cleveland Democracy and John Sher
man Republicanism through their or.
gans to attempt to mislead the peo
ple and induce them to believe
that the misery they endure
on account of falling prices
and hard times is substantial and in
creasling prosperity, 1is the sublimity
of effrontery and cheek. Tbsh idea
that there can be any general
prosperity wh!o the administra
tion assumes that the paper
and silver dollars in circulation must
be redeemed in gold, and when the
only way to obtain gold is by borrow
Ing it and increasing the national
debt, is absurd. The gold standard
and prosperity can notexist together.
The policy of refusing to coin our own
money and borrowing foreign gold to
pay interest on foreign obligations,
must and in ruin. It may be that a
few factories have started because
the supply of the commodities
they manufacture was exhausted. It
may be that 10 per cent of the 40
per cent. relction ia wages in bome
instances has been restored. It may
aeo be true that the increased de
sad fq. structural Iron for building
perpees has locreased the sativity in
tIat lduestry. Outside of these spe
cml cases we would like to know
where this prosperity exists. We
find on visiting different sections of
the country that they have heard of
prosperity, but it is never in thatpar
tic ular locality. It is always somewhere
else. The cuckoo who drew the plat
form of the Democracy of Pennsylva
nia and classed Cleveland with Jeffer
son and Jackson excelled in fullsome
nonsense the courtiers who flattered
Charles I. in his evil course until he
was relieved by death. The office
holder and the goldbug journal who
has the gall to tell the people that
they have substantial and increasing
prosperity to please the president and
the kings, must regard falsehood as a
virtue when it brings office and
cash. -Washington Silver Knight.

Col. Radcliffe. a \enerable man
with a gray batad. readt as follows:
,"On July 1. 1S'.l3, the secretary of
the treasury in his report, gave the
amount of molnet i1n circulation as $2,
~2.:t,517,977. (In c\amination it was
found that in this ,tatemient an error
had occurred by rcauon of counting
both the gold and -fiver in the treas
ury and the outstanding certificates
which repres.ented t!iem. Another
statement was then made showing the
amroant of money in circulation to be
$1,73,14,951,057. o" si, 1.:,93,9:'3 less
than amount first reportedl. (Of this
sum, there were t.i17,6'7,6~5 in gold,
$615,li61, L11 in sliver and 52.3,3!91,
853 in notes. In this aggregate of
money in circulation among the pro
ple, the secretary includes $7.311~.
683 of gold buhi,on and #11:,111.911
of silver bullion not coined, and which
could not be in circulation. If th;i
sum be deducted cu have left $1.511.
299,593. Of this amount *96,519.fl 
in gold coin, $233.63,(i.99 in sitver coin
and $19,953, 19i; in notes were loc ed
up in the treasury xaaults. and. therc

savings and private banks, having re
serves amounting to $:;t7.1.( I;..s; .
which leaves in circulation ,5-1,'233.

know that in 1S93 there were S5i:7.
697,685 in gold bullion and coin in
circulation? lie took the amount of
gold in the treasury and in the na
tional banks on June ;0, 1892, $113..

ed total of gold in circulatio, *2').
000,000 thus making $135.0.00.,00.
To this he added all that had been
coined at the mints since 1x72,
with the gain or loss of gold exported
or imported as registered at the
Custom Houses, deducting $3,3.)0.0 l0
each year for the industrial arts,
which is far too little. The secretary
assumes that every doila: coined since
1872 is still in existence, and that non.
have been lost or dostroyed by fire.
shipwreck or otherwise. I do not be
lieve that there is any s-uchi amount I
of gold in circulation as #597,000,00.,.
I do not believe there is a gold coin
to-day in this audience, and the samen
statement can be safely made any
where in this country. If the treas
ury report is correct,. it is a sad com
mentary upon the patriotism of those
among us, who see the government
paying an enormous bonus to the
Rothschild syndicate to obtain gold in
order to maintain its reserve.
'.It would be correct, in my opin
ion, to deauct at least $2350,0J0,0),)
from the estimate of the treasury for
the amount of gold in circulation, and
this would leave the total amount of
money in circulation #l31,255,067.
*'Besides this the secretary in hi
estimate counted #419,332,559 of ,il
ver and $i77.415.723 of gold coin, or
#496,747,673. without deducting any
amount by reason of losses by fire and
shipwreck or otherwise, and If we fix
this sum at 19,674,767,. as tire total
loss from February 2$, 1878, to No
vember 1, 1893, it will leave the whole
amount in circulation $281.,80.303).
From this amount there should be de
ducted at least 10 per cent on the
amount of national bank notes now
outstanding, to cover losses by fire,
flood and otherwise, which would
make another deduction of $17,'71.
Sb~--leaving in actual circulation
4263.708.913. I'he totalpopulation of
the United States by the cenaus of

experience, Mrs. Gehrke said:
"A little over a year ago I was completely
broken down. I had been taking medicine
from a doctor but grew worse and worse
until I could scarcely go about at all. The
least exertion or the mere bending of my
body would cause me to have smothering
spells, and the suffering w ss terrible. I
thought it was caused by my heart. When
everything else had failedt to relieve nme
and I had given up all hol es of ever being
anything but a helpless iuvalid, I chanced
to read some testimonials in the Farm,.
Field and Fireside, also in the Chicago
Inter-Ocean and the suffering of the people
who made the statements were so nearly
like the suffering I had endured that
when I read that they were so
greatly benefited by the use of Dr.
illiams' Pink Pills for Pale People I
did not hositate to go at once and pur
chase two boxes. I took them according to
directions and before the first box was used
I felt a good bit better. Iteally the first
dose convinced me that it was a great rem
edy. Before the two boxes were used up I
sent my husband after three more boxes.
so I would not be without them. Wiien I
had used these three boxes I felt like a dif
ferent woman and thought I was almost
cured.
"Since that time I have beeen taking
them whenever I began to feel badly.
When I began taking Dr. Williams' Pink
Pills for Pale People I weighed only 118
pounds and after I had been using the med
icine for about six months I weighed 121
pounds. I have had a goodappetite ever
since I commenced taking them and in
stead of mincing along, picking such food
as I could eat even with an effort, I eat
most anything that comes on the table.
I am not the invalid I was. I do not have
to be waited upon nowas if I was a helpless
child, but I work all the time, doing the
housework and ironing and working in the
garden without that dreadful feeling which
comes over a person when they are afraid
they are going to have one of those spells
that I used to have.
"Work don't hurt me any more. I hon
estly believe that had it not been for Dr.
Williams' Pink Pills 1 would now be in my
grave. I still have what the doctor calls
bilious colic but the Pink Pills have made
me much better and the spells are not so
frequent and are nothing like as painful as
before I began to use them. I would not
be without the Pink Pills for that disease
alone under any circumstances, to say noth
ing of the other diseases for which they are
especially recommended. I take pleasure
in telling my neighbors the benefits I have
received from Pink Pills and know of sev
eral who have taken my advice and have
been greatly benefited by them."
