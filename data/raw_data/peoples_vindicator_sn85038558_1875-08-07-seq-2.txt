Trade of this Section.
There seems to rxist much exeite
ieant with relatiou, rather undue, ae
cording to our opinion, to the ulti
.,nate point, this alnd immediate sur
roniding parishes will seek as a mar.
Iet for sale and purchase.
The railroad agitation has devel
oped the discussion to a great extent,
and our New Orleans exchanges are
tilled. wfith articles declaiming upon
th'le advantages of that city as a point
of trade for North. Louisiana and
Northwestern and Easten Texas.
The loss of trade to- the city of
New Orleans cannot be summed un
der one head, we think, and it is as
hnuch due to the apathy of its capi
talists; its exhorhitant charges for
commissions; and the old fogy prices
for merchandise, as any other, save
the political pall that has o'orspread I
it.
Water will' seelt its level by the I
nearest practicable route-t4'ado the t
.cheapest market to buy, and the high- 4
est to sell. The trade of this section I
will go to that market whore it can -
procure its supplies cheapest, in ex- I
chaurgo for its products at Iiighest
-rates. The constructing of a railroad
from this place to New Orleans, will
not bring trade to it, simply fromn
that fact alone, and its completion to
either Marshall or Shreveport, leaves
us open to choose where we shall find
the best market. With the resuscita- i
tion of Now Orleans, the increase of
its business, and thereby its prosperi- i
ty, we have a deep interest, because I'
we, even at this distance, will feel it
to.a considerable extent. But, it. is a
nmootedquestion' with us, 'whether it
will not'be better to give Shreveport,
who has evinced up to this moment 1
no small amount of enterprise, the I
benefit of the other end of this rail- i
road, that se too, as a sister city of a
the same l"clhn" may not reap what
benefit she may from the enterprise,.
'and should she assume such propori
tions hs her citizens anticipate, would a
not her material advancement be felt i
more to our advantage than a city at
such a distance as New Orleans.
Busines8 men who desire the i'm
provement of their business, always
evince that desire by subscribing I
monies to construct such' means of I
transportation as would tend to bring i
trade to them, We are afraid this 1
cannot be said of New Orleans, if we
are to take as evidence the amounts
so far subscribed, and the occupation
of the persons subscribing. Twenty
fire cotton firms put up $21,510; twen
ty-two grocers $1,900, and fourteen
commission merchants $13,100, aid
s0 on.
The cotton firms and commission
men are the persons that get more
reiml benefit front our crops with less
capital tihan any other merchants.
'TPhy' hisve bled :~tie people iwttt t
per cent to'tell and buy, with 1* per
rates of insurance, and it should be
lImembered thmt;the InsuRagee C;om
panies. are all owned by those men,
or the greater part of them, which
has done so 'inch to i'njuire New Or
leans; to force trade to a market not
so hampered and throttled with usuri
ous rates of commission.
Examples are not wanting to prove
thle truth of our assertions, they can
be seen on every planters cotton sale;
on etery merchant's invoice.' '
Out of this rut: must the cityj come
to did ~ a r move must be made at
once. 'The cotton of this section will

command the best-price, but where it
will'also adt have the tiett proceeds

her nmercliants sell cheap; sell at
snlallprofits with quick returns; her
insurance coompanies st)op their 1l to
5 per cent gouging; have less picking
and stealing here and there; create
a demand for country products other
thali cotton, for which products we
must now resort to sell to some
swindling hawker, and .build your
road to Shreveport and she will fiud
that nothing is to be feared from any
of these rival cities.
New Orleans. to become a prosper
oes city, must throw. herself in the
breach; advance into active compe
tition with other business cities, and
if she fails why-"she fails."
"While tiluerous knowledge stands con
sidering
Audacious ignorance hath done the deed."
Shreveport has conformned to' the
demands of the trade by reducing to
living rates charges upon products
shipped to her port for sale, and at
the sa:1me time has met the demand
for supplies with low priced merchan
dise. The self arrogance of New Or
leans will be her ruin if continued in
--no t)'ade can be forced, it must flow
natuirally, and when New Orleins
convinces the people of whom she
demands trade, that they will meet
with remunerative bargains, both in
sale and purclase, her future is made. -i
As to the building up of Shreveport
as a center of trade and a 'large bu
siness city for North. Louisiana, our. t
interest compel nsto 'favor it, and l
New Orleais should lend all the aid
in her power .io further its advance- ,
ment, for it will ant as a. valve to r
draw trade ;to our Queen city, fromn
St. Louis anL'other northern cities. i
The beneft whichl will accrue to the
intermediate parishes is obvious, for
by this means we will have competi- t
tive markets near at hand from
which to select. The advantages
eannot be calculated that would ac
cr1ue to us on such a consnmnition, and I
we hope that our New Orleans friends t
will give Shreveport and their fellow- t
citizens a patient hearing in the pre
mises.
All these things we say to some of 3
New Orleans; of which nunmber Mr. 1
Wheelock is not. :The road ,:from
New Orleans will be. built despite
the croakers here and elsewhere, and I
the matter of the small amount of l
the subscription, as.it seems,. has been
fully explained to our people.
P. A. Simmons, the claiment by
grace of Hahn's delicious party, for
mayoralty of our city has reached a
strange end to his string.
He, as we understood the question
in its "wneak and puling" state, was
what was.considered as a "rcd hot,"
what you may call hiui." He made
"a dead flat failure" as a candidate
for the Legishlitnre And then "hopped
in" for a small slice of the city chick
en pie. There is "crust" to all ta.-, ,
and we are ot tihe opmion that this I
fthin will "sour" to some one.
DeVargas was elected by the irlidl
vote of the respectable white and col
oredl tax fayers of this city, the fact of
which'Mr. Simmons, after being de
feaied by ninety mnajorit3, saw fit to
test in the Kellogg courts. Our peo.
ple subiiitted to it, but now cemes
this "deponent and says things to
numerous to mention," and proposes
to "ride in" rbnghhlianded.
We are of the oipinion that it will
be a "rough handed" game.

quite enthusiastic.

Editor "Natchitoches Vindicator',:
Dear Sir :-I notice, in your paper .
of the 24th inst., an article headed,
"liruggist & Merch;;ants War"- in
which you invite the views (of the l
leading lawyers uponI the custom as '
well as the law in the case, concorn
ing the license.
Befolre I give you my legal opinion, sl
I have to apologise to you for parti- at
cipating in a controversy where I am `
not invited, for I am not a "leading el
lawyer," but only a common sense
lawyer and not likely to be employed A
by either apothecary or merchants in
the present case, so I am free to ex
press my opinion in the matter:
1st. "The act of 187?, No. 14; Sec.
17; says: For each apothecary or (It
druggist $50 ; that no druggist shall Re
be licensed except lie shall have a `t
diploma from some medical or phar. J"
maceutical society."
2d. What constitutes an Apotheca- at
ry f One who practices pharmacy;
one who prepares drugs for medical
use, and keep. them for sale. "Webs
ter's Dictionary."
3d. Now for the law and its defini
tion ; the apothecary or druggist pays P
his license for his principal business
and his exclusive privilege as such,
namely : to compound medicine, such
as to dissolve opium in alcohol andt
sell it for laudanum ; or mix opiun, T
benzoic acid, oil of anise, camphor, fi
honey and alchohol and make of it f
paregoric; also mixes rhubarb, cal- fl
omel and honey, forms pills, and calls 81
them cathartic pill ; after these com
pounds are marJe and mixed and y'
ready ifor market, he sells same to a
person for individual use; or to mer- al
chants for sale to his customers; in I
fact, after the composition is mixed, f.
- prepared, &c., it becomes a merchau- a
Sdise ; but the nmerchant has not the b
privilege to compound medicine for 81
this belongs to the apothecary or drug- k
gist for which he pays his license as e1
merchandise ; like calomel, castor oil, iU
nux vonmica, cream tartar, soda, canm- C
phor, turpentine, peppermint, sual- tl
r phur, asafoetida, &c., and these be- ti
long as much to the medical as well al
as the merchantilo line and of course it
can be sold under either license. I
I 4th. As for the eastom in this ease, eI
I will give you my experience for the
last thirty years in this and sur jt
rounding parishes: One druggist in tl
Natchitoches sold under his apotheca- sa
I ry license, paints, window-glasses,
f guns, pistols, cutlery, diamond rings,
- plated rings, looking-glasses, frames
and pictures, cigars and cigarettes
and a full assortment of stationary. S
Another druggist sold,, tobacco,
cigars, garden seeds, blacking and
t paint) brushes, combs, &c.; a third
sold hats, jewelry, satchels,. valices, f
statiortry&t. Ini fact, the tpotheca- t
a ries kept any and every thing in the r
e line of merchandise for sale to the
extent of their cash and credit ; and
the merchants, with one or two ex
ceptions, kept medicines and drugs t
n for sale under their license without e
u let or hindtanucofrom no one.' C
5th. To force thls extra license an
der tehe pretended shadow of "law,"
° is entirely impracticable and oppres
a sive, and can only have a barbarous
r, effect on the mnjority of the country
people ; for instance, takie any point
ontside of Natchitoches, there is no
. drug-store and very seldom a physi- I
cian who has half a supply lof medi
' cine; country persons have been ac
1, customed to take fifty cents to Uot
L. .: .. rtl ..w i.j.Itbo aSb rclteedieS
, for variots diseases; for instana3 fort
'"rattle snake bite," a teaspoonful of
'g iodine is a sure cure, by taking it
re every fifteen uminutes and applying
.e same to the wound; now, if ihe has to
go to Natchitcllhes for it, say from
"OGrlapp's Bluff," he might as well
send tir the undertaker for a coflin
'e at once, because the patient will be
ig dead by thie time the muedicine is had,
re to say nothing about doctors' advices
and services from four to ten dollars
mileage.
SOf course a country merchlant can
i- not afford to pay a $50 license, when
d his sales of tuedicines probably wont
ait mount to $50 a year. My opinion is:
Auditor Clinton is wrong im makiung
this demandon our tax collector, and
I don't think hle advised with Atft'y
t General Field about making such de
es mand, for it is neither law, nor .com
e men sense and without a spark of
reason. I look'upon it as a carpet
bagger's ingenuity to oppress and
h, larrass the people even the helpless
poor and sick, until the screw will
' break again and burst up the patchted
)7 upmaclhipery.
' Yoars truly, ...

Dear Sir: I scribbled Von off a nte
last inight and nientioned thatI woult
see parties to-day and write again.
Crops are in good condition as a
general thing. Corn though will tfldl
short on account of not getting rain
at the time when most ileeded ; but
as for cotton, I don't think the farmn
era of this section ought to complaiu,i
The Masonic funeral and proces- t
Aion of Geo. II. Radisky came off at t
Colfax on Qunday, Ist. Montgomery c
and Cloutierville Lodges coUllposinl
the procession. Everything passed d
ofl' quietly and the ceremonies were
quite imposing. I weplt down with
several others from here. I under
stand crops in Winn have been in
juared considerably ,by the drolught.
Nothing new stirling now, and ifi
any occurs soon, I will post you.

Crop Reports. g
Richlhmad Beacon: The crop pros, u
pest continues quite promising.
Brasher News: We notice the
crops along the Aclhatilaya and Teche
as for up as Franklin are looking bet- e
ter than we ever saw them before.
There is more acreage in corn than
for many years, and the yield will he
from 15 to '20 bairels per acre. We
have every reason to believe that ri
St. Mary will make a larger crop this
year than any year since the war. C
Sugar Planter: Crop prospects are
all lovely, the -gooso of anticipation
hangs high and every planter and
farmer looks forward to harvest time
as the realization of a horde of green
backs to pay off debts with, plenty of 11
spare for a "rainy day"--if anybody p
knows what that means in the gen- L
eral acceptance of the term. Cotton p
is doing magnificently everwhere. t
Corn is nearly ready to "break" and o
the cane crops, with very few excep. a
tions, ready to lay by, while planters b
are turning their attention to getting d
in wood, and putting their sugar )
houses in order for the grinding sea- II
son. ti
Rural Times: Crops are, badly in- a
jured by the drought in soame parts of b
this parrlh. A great many, however, a
still report their prospects fair.
