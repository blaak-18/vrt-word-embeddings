Who Was Right?
Two years ago the Populist said
that a change of administration
from Republican to Democratic
would not make times any better.
The Democratic speaker said it
would. Who was right The
Populist then said that Grover
Cleveland and the eastern wing of
tie Democratic party were not in
f vor of free silver and would,
with the assistanceof Republicans,
defeat it. The Democrats said not,
but if they were given power they
gould pass a free silver bill. Who
was right? Two years ago the
Populist maid that Grover Cleve
land would stand in with the mon
ey power. The Democrats said he
would not. Who was right? Two
years ago we said that the money
question was the main issue and
tihat the Democrats would engage
in a sham fight over the tariff to
cover it up and distract the atten
tion of the people while the banks
were securing control of the coun
try. The Democrats said we were
wrong; that if they were given a
chance they would knock the prin
eiples of protection higher than a
kite. Who was right? We said
Cleveland was a gold bug and
would veto a silver b'11 if one was
passed. They denied it. Who
was right We said prices would
be better than they had been under
the Republican administration.
They said they would. Who was
right? We maid they would favor
trsts and corporations just the
ane as the Republicans did. They
daled it. Who was right? We
said they world not abolish banks
Sissue as Jefferson and Jacksoa
ueommsmded. They said they
woul. Who wa right? We maid
strikes would continue, tramps
weould rease, mills would bsut
down, money grow scarer, prices
bwr and times harder; they hoot
edat the idea and maid we were
_wrsy. Who was right? Now
they awre out with more predictions
sa pemies to again deelve the
pIoPle. Truest them not, they are

deeiv, the peopl to obtaei thema.

THE ELECTION.
Big Gains for the Populists.
Natchitoches parish goes Popu
list by 486 majority. With a fair
count Bailey's chances are good to
carry the district.
The election passed off quietly
so far as we can learn. The offi
cial returns come in slowly. The
following is the official vote of
Natchitoches parish by wards:
Ugden. Bailey.
Ward 1 178 143
" 2 14 210
" 3 22 84
" 4 51 66

747 1233
The Democratic papers as usual
report great majorities before the
vote has even been counted. We
can surely congratulate Natchito
ches election officers, on their hard
fought fight for an honest election.
But from what we can learn so far,
Rapides is entitled to the blue rib
bon for the grandest frauds that
have been perpetrated in many
years.
Boyce, according to report gave
Ogden 400, while it only gave Bai
ley one. This bears fraud on its
face; besides, a prominent Demo
crat was told before the votes were
counted that it would be any where
from four hundred up. When
the Democrat remarked that "such
as that was a shame." At Alexan
diri the conduct at the polls was
such as to make a Democrat say
that it was a "shame and a dis
grace to the country." The tele
grams on the 6th of November,
(election day) gave 'the majorities
of DeSoto and Rapides, but 36
hours after- the polls closed, it is
impossible to get anything from
the Democratic papers, this points
to the fact that dirty work is be
ing done.
In Mr. Ogden's own parish, that
be lost in the primary election, the
Democrats claim a majority of over
2500. At the Benton precinct in
that priah, we are told by a res
odlmble party who formerly resi
ded there, that Mr. Ogden receiv
ed 1200 votes, when in reality there
isnot over 700 voters in the whole
ward.
We give below the following tel
-rans taken from the Shreveport
Ties a Demoeratic paper. But
we do not consider it reliable by
ay means :
Red River perish gives Ogdea
483 majority.
Ogden's majority in Rapides is
estimated at 2,500.
In Bossier, Ogden's home parish,
his majority will reach over 2,000.
At Beaton the vote stood Ogden
1,179, Bailey 2.
No further returns have beesa ra

DEMONETIZATION.
Senator J. Z. George Writes A
Logical Letter Regarding It.
Special to the rimes-Democrat.
JAcKSON, MIss., Nov. 1.-The
evening Clarion-Ledger contains
the following letter from Senator
J. Z. George, in answer to one
from the editor of the paper ask
ing him to make some speeches on
the financial question in this State :
"No converts can now be made
from the adherents of free coinage,
however able and ingenious the ar
guments advanced. The logic of
events succeeding demonitization
in 1873 and the repeal of the pur
chasing clause of the Sherman act
in 1893 is simply irresistible. Every
body can see that the predictions of
the friends of demonitization in
1873 and of the advocates of re
peal in 1,893, have not only not
been verified, but that the worst
apprehensions of those who op
posed both have been realized.
With cotton lower than ever known
before and continually falling,
with the consequent bankruptcy of
our farmers and other stagnation
of business and enterprise now
prevailing, there is no need for a
speaker to point out the cause of
disaster. Men may talk of the
large per capita of money in the
country, but that will deceive no
body. This per capita is in the
banks and held by large capitalists.
It is not in circulation; it is not
used in trade, commerce or other
business, but held idle, except
when loaned on a security (as Uni
ted States bonds) and they like
gilt-edge securities, which cannot
be given by one in a thousand sol
vent borrowers.
"The cry of overproduction will
deceive no one, for there are mil
lions upon millions of persons but
illy shod with cotton g'ods. Their
power of consumption has been so
diminished by demonetization as
to cause the glut complained of.
The vicious circle of delusive ex
cuses at last resolves itself into
this: There is money enough, or
more than money enough for the
small business actually transacted.
The contraction consequent on de
monetization has itself thus made
the causes which have dispensed
largely with the use of money.
"Since we are not allowed to
have a currency adequate to the
needs of commerce at the old
prices, they have been reduced not
only to meet the inadequate volume
of money but to produce a surplus.
It takes vastly less money to mar
ket the present crop than any
other in recent years. The idle
surplus is nothing but the amount
lost to producers by depressed
prices. Instead of going out to
pay reasonable and fair prices to
cotton and wheat growers, the
money is now engaged in still
further enhancing its own value
and grinding to powder the masses
of our people by awaiting, in the
coffers of capitalists, for a still
further fall in prices. Thus it will
be enabled for the same nominal
amount to purchase more and more
of human labor or its products.
Thus it will .be empowered to in
crease more and more that domi
nation in human affairs which has
resulted in giving to 85,000 per
sons onse-half of all the property
of all the people of the United
States.
"These views are so evident that
it needs no argument to cause them
to be accepted by the people. In
fact, the pesple understand this
matter quite as well as those who
claim to be experts in fimnacial
aciemce."
Steel Men to Form a Trust.

form an organization to maintain

Mr. Dockery's Experience.
It will be remembered that Mr.
Dockery of Iowa, guaranteed his
constituents that there would be no
increase in the price of sugar as
the result of Democratic tariff le-
islation, and, if there was, that he
would make up the difference to
them. Immediately upon the pas
sage of the Democratic tariff bill
the price of sugar was raised in
his district as a result- and Mr.
Dockery was called upon to make
good his pledge. Instead of twen
ty-two pounds for a dollar but sev
enteen could he obtained. When
he asked for an estimate of the in
creased cost to his constituents he
was astounded to learn that it
would take his salary for the next
term should he be re-elected.
It is claimed that since Mr. Iock
ery's exlperience the necessity for
preventing a rise in the price of
sugar became apparent to the Iem
ocratic managers, and it is said
they appealed to the Democratic
trust to enable them to make a
record upon cheap sugar, at least
until after the election. It is now
said that the Democratic campaign
managers have entered into an
agreement with the sugar trust
that the wholesale price of sugar
shail not be increased until after
the November elections. After
the November elections, it is claim
ed, the campaign managers do not
care what the price of sugar is.
The trust people, so the story goes,
have gladly agreed to this in return
for the many favors which the
Democratic party has conferred
upon it in the Senate tariff bill and
in securing the enactment of the
present law. It is alleged that the
Democratic campaign committee
will issue a statement taken from
the official records of the produce
exchange at Philadelphia showing
that the wholesale price of sugar
has not been increased by the pas
sage of the sugar trust bill. These
figures, running back for four
years, will show that whatever va
riations there may have been in
quotations of granulated sugar
there has been none since the Gor
man bill became a law. The Re
publican campaign committee had
an intimation some days ago that
the Democrats were about to put
forth a statement of this kind to
counteract the effect which the ac
tion of the retail dealers through
out the country has had upon the
popular vote. The retail price of
sugar has been increased on an
average of a cent per pound.
National Watchman.
How Are We To-Day ?
Everything looks dark and
gloomy, discontent abounds from
ocean to ocean and we have strikes
and riots, and tramps by the thou
sands. We have the oil trust, the
sugar trust, and the whiskey trust,
and monopolies of every conceiva
ble kind, all demanding and getting
tribute from our people. These
are the fruits of Republican and
Democratic rule. They have burn
ed up our money and issued bonds
in their stead for the benefit of
Shylock. They have destroyed
our silver as a money metal. Our
representative halls have been turn
ed into machines, and they turn
tariff reform in at one end and sin
gle gold standardism at the other.
Shylock furnishes the motive pow
er, and they proceed to grind; and
what do we geti More million
airs at one end and paupers by the
thousands at the other.--New Era
Standard.
It is now charged that the Dem.
oeratle managers have made a deal
with the trust to keep sugar down
at present prices antil after the
election. The advance in the price
was beginning to hurt the Demo
erat. sad something had to be
done, so they went to the sugar
trust bosses and made the deal,
and stopped the advance when the
eleetion is over look out for dear

Dver-Production-Another False-I
hood.
We have been told that the low
price of wheat was not due to the
demonetization of silver, but to
Overproduction. That is, nea had
raised too much food, while sewve
ral millions of hungry stomachs in
this country, and many more
across the Atlantic, were clamor
ing for something to eat, and had
not the work to procure the money
to buy it. But we have not raised
too much. Read the following ta
ble:
"The following table gives the
receipts of wheat at the four prin
cipal spring wheat markets from
the Ibginning of the crop year,
Aug. 1, 1893, to date, and for the
same time a year ago:
This Crop. Last Crop.
Bu. Bu.
Minneapolis...... 48,875.253 65.402.207
Milwaukee....... 16,264.670 14.732.033

The following table gives the
receipts of wheat at the four prin
cipal winter wheat markets from
the beginning of the crop move
ment, July 1, 1893, to date, and
for the same time a year ago:
This Crop. Last Crop.
Bu. Bu.
Toledo .......... 218,623 185,691
St. Louis ......... 526,717 700,000
Detroit........... 110,107 168,000
Kansas City....... 159,000 112,800
Total........1,014,447 1,166.894
From this it appears that, while
the population of the United States
is greater in 1893-1894, than in
11s92-1893, and therefore the wheat
crop should be so much greater, it
really fell off, so that the spring
wheat crop of 1893-1894 fell 69,
000,000 bushels below that of the
previous year, while the winter
wheat crop fell off 151,947 bush
els in the same time, or a total
shrinkage of 69,731,319 bushels.
And the crop of 1894 will be still
smaller than that of 1893. The
falling off from 1892 to 1893 was
equal to our whole average expor
tation of wheat from the United
States.-I. D. in Nonconformist.
Democratic Prayer.
NO. XIII.
Our most adorable political fath
er whose body is occasionally in
Washington, and whose heart is
always in Wall street; whose name
we love and split our throats cheer
ing whenever thy silver tongued
servants mention it; whose word
is law and whose frown means no
pie; whose avordupois weight is
300 but whose political weight is
more than that of all thy party;
again we bow before thee to ac
knowledge ourselves indebted to
thee for additional humiliation.
We come before thee, oh most
worshipful Grover, acknowledging
our own weakress. We haven't
got sense enough to lead a goose to
water. But a short time ago we
were yelling for free silver, free
sugar, free coal, free iron or a
free fight. When thou didst knock
silver out we cursed thy name.
We declared that thou wast not a
democrat. We said thou wast a
traitor and a rascal. Then when
the senate put sugar, coal and iron
on the protected list we swored a
mighty swear. We behold the
glory of the democratic party has
gone glimmering. But most kdor
able Grover, we sinned against
thee. We cover ourself in asck
cloth and ashes; it is about all we
have left to cover ourselves with.
We beg thy Majesty's pardon. We
don't know enough to set agoose
on a hillside. Kick as for our ig
norause. Kick us for our pre
sumption. KiCk us for daring to
speak evil of thee.
Kick ap for thinking at all. Kick
as for nt havig any sense.
Kick u for not having an opin
ion of our own.
Kick us to thy heart's content.
The more thou kickest us the more
we will love thee.
The more thou thumpest us on
the head the more we will sing thy
praies.
Hast not the Missouri democrat.
commended thy "patriotism, integ
rity, ability and courage?"
Have not the Alsbamn demorats
ang thy prbdest
Have not the Georgia democrats

Have not the Arkanmasdemocrats
knelt at the stool otf relw·tencee
Yes, Grover, thou art all right.
We are dad hlunnule fools for not
tinding it out sooner. ('huck our
heads in the mud of thy displits
Ire.
Sand lkf Ia with thy wr:ath. Sit
lown on us with thy greatnces:.
But let us worship at thy shrine.
We don't want any free silver. We
don't want any free sugar. We
don't want any free coal. We
don't want anything free but the
whisky we get during the cam
paign.
We want to protect everthing
that thou cainmmtandest us to.
We sinned when we cussed the
republicans for demonetizing sil
ver.
We sinned when we told them
protection was a fraud and uncon
stitutional.
We now want to apologizL to
them through thee.
The republicans have always
been right in everything except
wanting the offices. On this alone
do we differ from them.
But, oh, almighty Cleveland, thy
servants which are our bosses have
made us lie. They put the words
in our mouths. They told us to
yell for free silver, and we yelled.
They told us to yell for free su
gar, and we yelled.
They told us to yell for free raw
material, and we yelled.
They told us to yell against thee,
and we yelled.
Now they tell us to yell for thee
and we stand on our tip toes and
yell.
And why not ?
We are machines.
We are political jumping jacks.
We couldn't tell for the life of
us what kind of a democrat we are
going to be to-morrow, for we
don't know which string the bosses
will pull.
But we know that we will be a
democrat. It is easy to be a demo
crat. There are so many different
kinds. But, most adorable Grover
we are sorely pressed by the Popu
lists. They hem us in on every
side. They punch us with Jeffer
sonian doctrines.
They knock us on the head with
Jacksonian clubs.
They thrust Calhoun sticks into
our flesh.
They put Thomas Benton flies
into our political buttermilk.
They lariat us with "time hon
ored principles."
They beat us into a jelly with
Washington's farewell address and
Jackson's messages.
They cover us all over with the
democratic record in congress and
rub it on us.
They finish up by piling on top
of ps a mountain of broken prom
ises of the democratic party and
leave us struggling beneath the
burden.
Oh, most worshipful master,
thou who canat make congress
tremble in its boots and stamp plat
forms into the earth, ast thou
not do something to save us from
these pesky Populists? Surely
they are becoming as sandsm upon
the sea shore for numbers. Oh,
why didst thou not kill Coxey and
use him for aish bait ?
Verily he is a Populist breeder.
Save us, oh save us from the Pop
nlists, sad thine shall be the glory
forever-Amen.
Do you know what is the cause
of the war between China and
Japan. The samne cause that pro
ducedevery war that history re
cords. Robbery. Plain, simple,
unvarnished robbery. A desire to
get the goods that people make
without paying for them. Slavery
of the mauses to the classes. Both
China and Japan want to "pro
teet" Corea so they can collect
taxesr off its people. The poor
fools who do the fighting have no
rea interest in it. The men who
give their lives up at the command
of a king are themselves being
robbed by that king and ins no
bles, No matter what polished
court excuses are given, the plain,
every day name ad the cause is
robbery.-Comg Natio.
