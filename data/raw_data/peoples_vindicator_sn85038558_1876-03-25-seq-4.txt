WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
Champion ?American Comic Paper !
Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
can artists, and contributed to by the
most popular lumnorists and eatirists of
the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has Iweome t he established humorous andul
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continuted the first wyor as a
monthly, then, to satisfy thie demand of
the pullic, it was changed to a fortnight.
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting filly as it flies, and showing up
the pilitieal. and -ocial shams by its
nmasterly cartoons and pulngenlt editorials,
it achieved even greater success than
before, and was recognized as the ablest
and brightest of its class. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
demand, atnd now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, Ie
ing the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever pubfished in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnish illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellow, Thomas Worth Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels,
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet kuown to fame.
In its literary departmenuts Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the host families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fas
tidious.

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
stable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
"What is the cause of. the unpar
alleled success of VIINGoA BIT
TEns ?' Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never befhre in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded poe
sessiug the remarkable qualities of Vii.
soAl BITTERS in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,

Sheat and dryness, are invariably ac
vonmpanied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and

treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose

the dark-colored viscid mautter with which
