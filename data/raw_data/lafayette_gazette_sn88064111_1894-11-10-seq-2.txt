b a sonsce of genuine pleas
Stohem to know that their own
.h has remained true to the
cause of Democracy and white su
. e . The white people pf
='. pa rish have spoken and in no
Snsstakable terms they have
Oprdeed a strong and solemn pro
' est.against the action of the bounty
:'lpeoe to tutn this State over to the
':.RRpblicans. Some too saisguine
;pblimcans had indulged in the
" hope that this good old Demo
:otiatparish would give a big vote
-o Beattie and for bounty, and some
~ hiami were bold enough to com
::it the unpardonable sin of placing
it on the doubtful list. The result
:proves the political sagacity of these
:gentlemen. They were away off
and evidently did not know the peo
ple of this parish. Because a few
erring, but honest Democrats, had
expressed their willingness to vote
for Beattie, these mistaken prophets
foresaw a large Republican gain.
"'Just wait until the election and
you'll see !" And what did
Swe see? The .most complete
snowing under. of the Republicans
in the history of our parish. In
two of the largest wards they did
not get a single vote, not even one
for seed. In another precinct one
lonely Republican ticket kept com
pany to 47 .Democratic ballots.
Right here in the town of Lafayette,
the so-called strong hold of the Re- I
publicans which :is said to have i
been promised to Beattie, the Dem
ocrats scored a glorious victory, 1
getting a majority of 163 out of the
- total vote of 299.
Although our pleasure has been
-~arred by the-landslide in other
States our own State and particu
larly our parish, have given us am- I
pie cause to rejoice. 1
One of the encouraging features
of the election was the absence of
the negroes from the polls. It was
a white man's fight from start to
finish, and no good citizen, Repu
blican or Democrat, will regret it.
WVA TTERSON DN TAHE
ELECTION.
In the Courier-Journal, under the
heading, "Have we a Democratic 1
Party?" Mr. WVatterson says:
,"Never did a great party go to 1
the people under such handicaps as
were carried by the Democrats in
to the campaign just ended. The
hard times were bad enough, but
they might have been parried. The 4
factionr fights among small claimants I
and rival placemen were bad 1
enough; 'but parties have met and
overcome such obstacles before
now. But with the record of 'per
fidy and hishonor,' as Mr. Cleve- I
land aptly described it, to face and
defend in a hand-to-hand fight with
the united Republicans, led by Har
rison, McKinley and Reed, it was
disheartening for Democrats to have
to face also the dull, self-sufficiency
and stolid indifference of an ad- i
.ministration that made no sign, u.
tered no word, and at least in the
state of New York seemed to desire I
the defeat of the regular Democrat
ic nominee. What wonder that sot
much apathy in the official head
should breed disaffection in the
rank and file? WVhat wonder that
with so many knives whetted at
WVashington there was blood upon
the moon down in the precincts?
"But i: is over, and let us hope ,
it is well over. We shall have time
to look about us, and whilst bury
ing our dead to cast some balance
for the living.
"'The battle for tariff reform will I
have to go down foot and take a
new start. The battle over the
money issue will soon be upon us.

ocracy enough left to make a great

whether we must still wear a coat

1aOvTA - oP .IfE SUGAR
TE  AT cS.
New Orleans States.
Louisiana returnsu a solid delaga
tion to 'the Fifty-fourth Congress.
There has never been any reason
able doubt that Boatner, Ogden ]
and Robertson would be re-elected. t
But at one time the coalition be- E
twhen the Sugar-teat Republicans,
the old carpet baggers and scalla
wags and the negroes seriously
menaced Democratic ascendency in '
the First, Second and Third dis
tricts of the State. Happily for Lou- g
isiana, the result has been a com- C
plete and humiliating defeat of the
iniquitous coalition formed to sell a
out the Democratic party and the -
honor of the State in consideration j
of a bounty on sugar,
Meyer, Buck and Price, the Demo- a
cratic candidates in the three sugar s
districts, have been elected to the a
lower House of Congress by large r
majorities. Louisiana has answered
the Sugar-teats with a stroke of n
lightning and a clap of thunmler. s
In this State, no combination, how- h
ever wealthy and respectable a con
tingent it may have, can again re- fi
store the reign of fraud, rapine and lI
brutal ignorance. No man will again a
represent any of the Louisiana dis- P
tricts who is in favor of, or in n
league with, a movement, the ten
dency of which is to revive the ne- r
gro as a political force, and who is
proposes, for a mercenary consider
ation, to support the party of cen- A
tralization, of force bills, "nigger
ism," high taxation, bargain coun- C
ter politics and governmental pro- t,
fligacy. c
The Democratic party has been f(
defeated in nearly every direction. h
But,. thank heaven, it holds its ti
power in Louisiana, where it was so ei
seriously and vigorously assailed.
Noble State! Land in whose bose bosom l'
our ancestors sleep, under whose
skies our eyes first met the light of St
day, your honor and. interests are to
safe in the keeping of the Demo- m
cracy, and may heaven bless your
fields in the valleys and on the
hills with bountiful harvests and
your marts of trade with unexam- tt
pled prosperty. se
The Sugar-teats are thrcatening 1
to contest the election of Meyer, s
Price and Buck. Defeated disas- a
trously by the people, in their hun fa
ger and thirst for bounty, wrung by r
an iniquitous system of taxation
from the earnings of the American g
people, they now propose to go be
fore the next House, which, it ap
pears, will have a Republican ma- st
jority, and appeal to that body to h
ttample upon the will of the people ti
of Louisiana, and seat these beaten c'
candidates. It is quite probable that tl
the Sugar-teats may induce a Re
publican body to disgrace and be
foul itself by perpetrating such an
outrage. Mr. Coleman is quite com
petent to take a leading part in
such a scheme. He has had large
experience in that line of business. d
When he was in the Tom Reed ir
House, he assisted, with alacrity
and skill and with eminent success,
in defrauding fifteen of the De
mocratic districts of their legal re- a
presentatives, and, in defiance of it
justice, law and honor, seating in 1
their steadl defeated Republican
candidates, such as he himself, Ker- r
nochan and Beattie now are. a
The sugar-teats thus have in their C
own ranks an expert in the thimble- n
rigging process of unseating Demo- c
crats and thus making Republiccan
victories in the House of Represen
tatives out of Republican defeats by n
the people. And besides Mr. Cole- '
man, they will have as advisers and
friends Bill Chandler, Grandmao
Hoar, and other old radical free- n
booters, election cheaters, thwarters b
of the Southern public will, and g
wavers of the "'blood yshirt," and as h
active co-partners of Coleman, such c
Northern Representatives as Tom 4
Reed, Burrows Cannon and Hou
telle, who would just as soon
swindle a Southern Democratic
constituency out of its representa
tive as a "nigger" would steal a
chicken off the roost.
The cry of "fraud" raisecd by the
sigar.-,teats is an arrant fraud itself.

Bear This In Mind.
Atlanta Constitution.
The present cotton crop of Geor
gia will yield our farmers only $25,
00ooo000.
If we manufactured this cotton
l at home it would yield $0o5,ooo,ooo
" -more than four times what we
get for the raw material I
We are not running our afHairs
upon business principles. What
sense is there in letting outsiders
manufacture our great staple and
reap all the profits.
The same reasons that carry fur
naces to the iron and coal fields
should bring the cotton mills down
here into the cotton belt.
We have the raw material, cheap
fuel and water power, satisfactory
labor, good transportation facilties,
and we can get the capital. Every
pound of our cotton should be
manufactured here at-home.
This policy is the south's royal
road to fortune. Our present policy
is the straight road to poverty !
An Autumn Picture.
Atlanta Constitution.
The Cleveland Progress, a bright
Georgia weekly, has an autumn edi
torial which shows that in White
county, at least, the much wished
for "'good times" have arrived. In
his picture of the pleasures of au
tumn in the country, the Georgia
editor says:
Around the syrup mills is a continuous
flow of good humor and sweet juice of the
cane, and the young farmer at the boiler
throws kisses through clouds of fragrant
steam at his sweetheart who has come down
to the mill to watch the process of syrup
making.
The chickens and turkeys walk stately
and proud, little dreaming of the near
Thanksgiving day and coming Christmas,
while the housewife points out in pride to
the neighbor the choice of the fleck she has
selected for these occasions.
And why should we not be a ha-Ppy peo
pie? And why should we not whistle and
sing and be full of joy when we have our
harns full, and the pens are heavy with
fatted swine, and peace and prosperity
reigns throughout the land?
The above gives an enchanting
glimpse of the good times in the
Georgia country districts at this
delightful season. Surrounded by
such conditions, the people must be
happy, even if cotton is down to
the last notch. Everybody will
congratulate that "young farmer at
the boiler, throwing kisses through
fragrant steam at his sweetheart,"
while the fat turkeys conjure up
visions of great thanksgiving days.
The Farmer so situatel-with
peace and plenty around him, has
the best of life, and to him every
day should be a day of thanksgiv
ing.
Cheap Cotton.
Middling cotton was sold in the
Memphis cotton market yesterday
at 5 718. T'his is the lowest point
it has ever touched here since
1844 45
In 1843 the price of middling in
in New York went down to 5 cents,
and the highest that year was 6
cents. In x844 New York quoted
midding all the way from 5 to 9
cents, and in x845 from 4 to 9 cents.
The average for the three years was
less than 5 7-8. The market re
mained .close to that range until
1852, a period of about xo years.
Taking into consideration the fact
of transportation to New York cost
much more than it does now, it may
be stated as a fact that the cotton
grower in those years could not
have averaged more than 3 3-4
cents for his crop in x843, '44 and
45, and only a small fraction more
in the succeeding six years.
This was a time when the much
lauded "dollars of the dadies" was
in full bloom, silver coinage was
free and every silver coin, big and
littje, was a full legal teinder.
The high prices of cotton follow
ing the war (whenfhere was no sil

precisely Mr.- Cleveland's attitude
towards Senator Hill in the gigantic
political battle being waged in the
Empire Staie at this time.
Senator Hill did not hesitate to
bury his personal feelings on the
floor of the United States Senate,
when the administration needed his
influence and support in behalf of
Democratic principle Now that he
is engaged in a battle royal in Mr.
Cleveland's own State, for Demo
