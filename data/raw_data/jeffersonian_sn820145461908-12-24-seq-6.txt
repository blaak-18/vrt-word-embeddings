ZETTERY THE PEOPLE
THE JEFFERSONIAN appreciates renewals more than it can express.
It not only means substantial support to the publications, but it is a proof
of a personal friendly feeling. We like to feel that publisher and sub
scriber are laboring together in a great cause. It is the best Christmas
feeling that we could possibly have.
Below we quote some striking sentences from letters sending in renewals:
Geo. Mcßride, Edna, Kans., Dec. 12,
1908.
il Extend my time for the Maga
zine. Money is scarce, but must have
your publications, as they tell the
truth. ’ ’
P. E. Ferguson, Speegleville, Texas,
Dec. 19, 1908.
“If you see fit, publish the state
ment that I want the two JEFFER
SONIANS. I enclose $2.00.”
M. R. Bond, Dewy Rose, Ga., Dec.
17, 1908.

J. L. Keeten, Glen Rose, Texas, Dec.
13, 1908.
“Enclosed find $2 for renewal of
my subscription. I wish I were able
to buy some of your bonds. Not for
profit, but to help the reform that
you are working so hard for. I do
hope the people will lay down preju
dice and view you from a true stand
point.”
W. 8. Harrison, Dangerfield, Texas,
Dec. 14, 1908.
“Enclosed find money order for
the two Jeffersonians. I do all in
my power to get people to read your
publications. I hope the day is near*
when people will wake up and see
what your papers stand for.”
James D. Williams, Commerce, Ga.,
Dec. 12, 1908.
“Find enclosed money order for
eighteen subscribers to the Jeffer
sonian. I will send my own re
newal w T hen due. Wife and I feel

did enjoy your editorial on the Hoke
Organ and poor Jim Woodward.”
Dr. John S. Kelly, Lawrenceville,
Ga., Dec. 14, 1908.
“Find check for $2.00 for the two
Jeffersonians. I could not do

highly on your Presidential Cam
paign. ’ ’
E. F. Bussey, Lockhart, Ga., Dec. 15,
1908.
“Find enclosed a dollar to renew

on it or else I would have sent it

wrapper). I also hand it out to
others to read.”
I. A. Rush, Montezuma, Tenn., Dec.
10, 1908.
“I find my subscription to the
iVeekly Jeffersonian is about to ex-

and myself take the Magazine and
have it paid for for two years ahead
yet.”
B. H. Wade, Beldon, Miss., Dec. 12,
1908.

Democrat and to the home of every
laboring man.”
H. G. Roberts, Franklin, Tenn., No
vember 20, 1908.

Should have remitted before but on

ful follower till the end of time.”
■C. C. Coleman, Cuthbert, Ga., Dec.
15, 1908.
“Please find enclosed $6.75 for
The Jeffersonians, Weekly and Mag
azine, as per special offer. Would
that I could help you, but I realize
in you a man that never gives up and
I hope and pray that you may be
successful in your great work. I feel
to know that the man who can with
stand the hard knocks, together with
the temptations that have been set be
fore you, and who has always been
true to the cause, has something more
in his heart than desire for the flat
tery of frail man, ,?
TJaffersonlan
A. D. Renshaw, Sterling City, Texas,
Dec. 12, 1908.
“Enclosed find five dollars for sub
scriptions listed. I am going to do
all I can for The Jeffersonians for
I hold them far superior to any pa
per in the world. If we can get the
principles advocated by them enacted
into law I will have received the
greatest commission that could be giv
en to me. It is the good that you,
through your Jeffersonians, will do,
that I am working for, so you will
find any time I send names, the full
amount, commission and all.”
B. S. Clements, White Sulphur
Springs, Ga., Dec. 12, 1908.

L. L. Winter, Augusta, Ga., Dec. 12,

“Can’t do without your papers.
Only source of getting facts about
the affairs and true condition of the
country. ’ ’
C. D. Rivers, Summerville, Ga., Dec.
10.
“Please find $2 enclosed, for which
renew my subscription to both The
Jeffersonians. I cannot afford to
miss an issue of a. publication that
contains such editorials as that one
of yours this week on the Atlanta
Mayoralty. You will never die polit
ically until the competitive middle
class has been annihilated, for the
reason that you are the only leader
at all representing that class.”
LET US AGITATE AND EDUCATE.
Bruce, La.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson:
You wfill find enclosed $4 for two
subscriptions to The Jeffersonians. I
have read your paper and magazine
ever since the first issue, and have be
come so attached to them that I had
rather do without one meal a day
than miss the information and pleas
ure that I get from their pages.
If every subscriber would get a
new reader for the two Jeffersonians
and double the subscription every
year for the next four, what a great
change would be wrought in the na
tional election of 1912. This would
give sixteen readers in 1912 where we
had only one in 1908, and would
bring about a change in our financial,
system that would give sl6 in green
backs to one of gold and silver. I
want to be the first to pledge Brother
Tom fourteen more subscribers be
fore the election of 1912.
I have been in the reform move
ment since the days of the Alliance,
and while we have suffered defeat,
I am not the least discouraged; be
cause I know that truth crushed to
earth will, Phoenix-like, rise from its
own ashes. I am sorry that the Mis
souri World suspended, as it was one
of my favorites, and I had my sub
scription paid up to 1910, but I am
willing to say to its noble and pa
triotic editor, “Well done, thou good
and faithful servant of the Reform
Cause,” for I feel that I have got
more than the value of my money, and
am willing to pay him some during
his vacation. Now, in closing, let me
say to all reformers, let us agitate
and educate for the next four years,
and in 1912 we will be prepared to
put one of the greatest fights for suf
fering humanity that the world has
ever witnessed.
Yours for reform until the victory
is won,
E. P. BRUCE.
A LETTER EVERY MAN, WOMAN
AND CHILD SHOULD READ.
The Jeffersonian, Gentlemen:
I think if we could organize our
party under the name of Jefferson
Democrat party w r e would make bet
tetr success. I hear lots'-of people
say they are Watson men, but they
can’t endorse the name Populist. I
think every Populist ought to contrib
ute at least 5 cents per month; with
small contributions from every Pop
ulist we could send the gospel of
Jefferson Democracy to every part
of our country and thus win the vic
tory in 1912.
It will be an endless chain, for
every new convert will send in his 5
cents and we can send speakers and
organizers to every county in the
United States. Would like to hear
from others on the subject. If 20,000
Populists will send 5 cents this month
we can put five men in the field for
thirty days.
Comrades, let’s send in our 5 cents
for the next four years, and make
Jefferson Democracy a power to be
reckoned with. In two years Popu
lism should claim every Southern
state, besides many Northern states.
We are on the right track and all we
need is a little help from every Jeffer
sonian Democrat, and with this help
in 1912 we will seat the grandest man
of our nation in the White House,
namely, Hon. Thomas E. Watson.
It doesn’t make any difference
whether you are a voter or not, if
you believe Jeffersonian principles
you can help spread Populism by
sending in your mite. Won’t every
reader of The Jeffersonian send in 5
