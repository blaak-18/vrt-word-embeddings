person and carry same. I have
learned by-good authority that there
could be no Watson nor Taft tickets
found at some of the precincts as
there was a goodly number of whites,
as well as blacks, that wanted to
vote for Watson or Taft, but could
not find tickets. Anything to beat
Bryan, was the cry, which, thank
God, was done and if Watson tick
ets could have been found, Bryan
would have been buried so. deep polit
ically that it would have taken twen
ty-five years to have raised him. Be
fore I close this letter I want to tjel)
you, Mr. Editor, and all true and
tried Pops, how my precinct, Milford,
went: Watson 28, Bryan 22, Taft 14,
which was a very light vote for Mil
ford, as there are sometimes upwards
of 300 votes polled here, it being the
largest voting precinct in the county.
Therefore, brother Pops, let’s never
give up the fight till the victory is
won for as sure as our noble leader,
T. E. M atson, lives, if we will only
help him fight our battles, we are
sure to win, for truth crushed to
earth will rise again; the eternal
years of God are hers.
Yours truly,

RECALLS A PREDICTION.
Rice, Texas, Nov. 5, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My DeDar Friend: How forcibly I
am reminded of your prediction No
vember, 1904, viz., W. J. Bryan will
be the next nominee in 1908 of the
Democratic party, and he will be
worse beaten than Alton B. Parker.
With very best wishes for you and
all your interests, as ever, your
friend,
E. G. Sessions.
RE-ORGANIZE AND KEEP UP
THE FIGHT.
San Antonio, Tex., Nov. 22, 1908.
Dear Sir: Now that the Stand
ard Oil smoke, the Tobacco smoke
and all the other smokes of the re
cent sham battle between the two fac
tions of the money power, the Re
publican and Democratic parties, has
cleared away, is there not some way
for those who believe in the funda
mental principles of good govern
\ ment to get together and carry on the
work of education that you have been
so' .nobly and unselfishly doinjz '?
The? only hope of removing the
shackles of partyism from (he minds
of the people lies in a propaganda of
education beg m now and continued
for the next four years. A meeting
of all those who would agree upon
a platform embodying the principles
you have been fighting for the last
twenty years should be called. If
that cannot be done, then let the Pop
ulists call a meeting and take imme
diate steps to reorganize' and keep up
fight. Surely there are /enough of us
left to start such a movement and
keep it going till it sfhall grow to
such proportions that by 1912 we
shall have a following that will over
whelm all opposition and bring our
government back to what its founders
intended it to be —a government of
the people, by the people and for the
people.
Yours truly,
G. E. Melliff.

Dear Sir and Friend:
The election has passed, the Peer

your Christmas wish in last week’s

glowed with appreciation. I was

“DON’T BE DISAPPOINTED.’’
Greenville, Ala., Dec. 16, 1908.
My Dear Mr. Watson: Speaking
of historical sketches and the indif
ference of the reading public, there
is just one thing I want to say. And
that is, that I don’t believe you real
ize how very deeply appreciated
your historical works are. Just in.
my small world they are so widely
read, discussed and enjoyed, by so
many different kinds of people, too.
I have noticed that many busy busi
ness men own and read your books on
history. The rector of the Episcopal
< church (my next door neighbor) is
an enthusiastic reader of your books.
So don’t for one minute be disap
pointed in the appreciativeness of the
public. Just please keep writing the
same kind! You are undoubtedly
conferring a favor, a benefit, to us
all.
I am very interested in The Jeffer
sonian, and I want it to be a power
in the land. And I guess it’s only
natural for me to want you to write
for it other things than politics. Not
leave politics off, you know, but add
the others. But what a very busy
man you must be!
With very best wishes for a bright
and joyous Christmas and a bright
and prosperous New Year, I am
Cordially yours,
Edith Tatum.
HOKE WAS TOO MUCH.
Atlanta, Ga., Dec. 24, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Tom: I am addressing you as
“Dear Tom” for the simple reason
that I have been working along with
you ever since I crossed the line into
Georgia in December, 1890, except
the year you worked for Hoke. He
was too much for me, and I balked
in following you. In the 90’&I wrote
quite a number of articles for The
People’s Party Paper.
Incidentally, you will find enclosed
my check for renewal of my sub
scriptions for the coming year to the
two Jeffersonians. Can’t very well
do without them.
Wishing you a merry Christmas
and that a regular cyclone of pros
perity may .visit you during the New
Year, I remain,
Yours very truly,
Geo. T. Keener.
