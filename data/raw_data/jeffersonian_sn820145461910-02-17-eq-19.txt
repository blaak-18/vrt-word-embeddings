What the Roman Catholic Church
Has Done to the Bible
In Jeremiah, 51: 7, is a statement
that: “Babel” —not Babylon—and
the words “hath been,” making it
past tense, is not in the Hebrew—
“a golden cup in Yehovah’s hand,
that made all the earth drunken:
the nations have drunken of her
wine; therefore the nations are
mad.” Which statement, taken in
connection with our Savior’s prophe
cies concerning “the Kingdom of
Heaven” —under which we have
been living since—Mark 1: 15 and
Hebrews 1: 1-3—as recorded in
Matthew 13, 25, 31, 33, 44, etc., in
dicates, first, that an enemy of man
kind oversowed a field of wheat
with darnel, or cheat (James’ bish
ops have rendered it “tares” to fur
ther confuse the common reader,
just as He charged the priests of
His day—Luke 11: 52—with “tak
ing away the key of knowledge,”
“not entering into the kingdom
themselves, nor suffering those who
are entering to Second, that
a man would take a mustard seed,
which is only a pungent condiment,
and incapable of being converted in
to bread, which he would sow in
his field, or denomination. Third,
that a woman would take yeast and
put it into—the law—the prophets,
and the Psalms —here designated as
“three measures of meal,’” “till the
whole was permeated!” I venture
to say that no exegesis of the Bible
is explainable in any other manner
than that of Jeremiah, “the nations
have drunk of the wine of her forni
cation, therefore, the nations are
crazy!” Let us look at some of
these fermentations: In Matthew
4:18 we read He “saw two brethren,
Simon called Peter and Andrew.” In
Mark 1:16 “he saw Simon and An
drew his brother.” No Peter here.
In Luke 6:14 we read “Simon,
(whom he also named Peter,) and in
John 1:42 we read, “And when Je
sus beheld him, He said, ‘Thou art
Simon, the son of Jona; thou shalt
be called Cephas,’ ” which is by in
terpretation a stone. Then back
again to Matthew 16:18 we find some
yeast without any doubt. The Mes
siah always addressed him as Simon,'
never, as Peter. He said, “Thou art
Simon, son of a dove, or, they
will call you Kaifa,” which prophe
cy is fulfilled at this day. But He
could not have used the words of
verse 18, for He was a Hebrew of
the Hebrews. He had just before
said before the people that only
those who did the will of “His Fath
er in heaven could have any family
relation with Him,” and Matthew
13:1, “He went out of the house the
same day and sat by the seaside.”
So He would not say “My Church,”
the word used elsewhere being ek
klesia or called-out-ones, neither
would He have said “The gates of
Hell,” for when you get the right
terms, “The lake of fire,” we know
directly that a lake does not have
“gates”—and there is never found
any absurdities in His metaphors.
Now we have heard many contro
versies upon whether Simon—or
Peter, as they all call him, ac
cording to prophecy—was ever in
Rome as the first “Pappy” or not,
and here comes out that word of
Simon himself, making it the “sure”
word of prophecy, which is "a light
that shineth in a dark place,” but is
susceptible of proof, that the key of
knowledge is taken away from us
Americans today. These “enemies”
of all righteousness are attacking our
public schools and culling out of our
public libraries every book which
tells an ugly truth about them—the
Church of Rome. I challenge any
one to give the readers of The Jef
fersonian the history of what was
done by Damascus and his pagan
symposium from the fourth century
to the sixth century. The time of
the “Alexandrian nullification,”
when the fleeing emperor gave this
Christian bishop of Rome the succes
sion and authority of the Pontiffs of
Babel (Greek, Babylon) under the
151)4 TUffitsonian
ancient title of PTR RM—pro
nounced Peter Roma —or The Grand
Interpreter.
And these scoundrel enemies of
the Hebrew Messiah, who were them
selves priests of Nimrod, the negro
“seed of the woman,” until their
apostacy of lewdness —for Nimrod’s
wife, Semiramis, has the reputation
of being “a paragon of unbridled li
centiousness” —reached to Greece,
where the Greeks rejected a nigger
“promised seed,” and changed over
to Apollo and Bacchus—took the He
brew gospels and epistles and putting
the leaven of Babel into the heavenly
story of heavenly love changed Mes
siah’s Wonderful Name into the
meaningless Jesous Christos, turning
the Hebrew name of the Virgin Mary
being pure Chaldean—a compound
of Mars, the pagan god of war, and
Rhea or Ri, the goddess and part
ner in his abominations, and they
fermented the word of life with so
much infernal rubbish that no stu
dent with lexicon in hand can make
head or tail out of it unless he drinks
of the wine of her fornication and
so get crazy, but when a “sober”
man who knows the Chaldean lan
guage takes up such words as Peter
Roma, and a lot more (which you
shall have another week) a light
shines in on the whole darkness till
the student feels no surprise that
no one—not even a bishop or car
dinal—can give an exegetical, ety
mological or derivative definition to
anything they teach their ignorant
followers. This one thing is kept
from the people that King Roosevelt
and King Taft, with several Senators
and Representatives, are committing
fornication with the PTR RM Dago,
who calls himself Pius 10th, just as
we read in Revelations 17:2, and
that we appear to be on the eve of
a Roman Catholic negro Messiah of
Babel Pappy to make every Ameri
can take his superstitions from Rome
instead of the Word going forth from
Jerusalem.
Look out, Americans, for 1910,
and for the first to be elected- Ro
man Catholic President fornicator
over these United States of America.
