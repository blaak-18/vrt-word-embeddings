CLEANLINESS IS AKIN TO GOD
LINESS.
The committee on streets, alleys and
sidewalks from the Civic League re
:s quest the people of Shreveport to aid
them in their worthy but almost futile
efforts to keep Shreveport clean. Their
efforts will be entirely futile unless you
s do aid us.
:s We appeal to every man, woman and
child to help us. Kindly refrain from
throwing trash broadcast. Keep it con
centrated in barrels, boxes or cans.
Jt is the small things that count. And
a the depositing of papers, peelings and
kindred trash into receptacles while only
g little trouble would work wonders in
the ap# ndce of otui town; and you
L dild feel repaid for your trouble aand
s have, the satisfaction of knowing you
' have done somthing towards making
your town cleaner and more beautiful.
So we appeal to you individually for
ijst this little help. Won't you-the one
- reading -this-feel it his or her duty to.
do this little? It is your town and you
love it and want to see it more beautiful.
Beauty can not exist till cleanliness is
established.
The board of health and the street
cleaning department can accomplish
their work more readily if you'll help in
this. Put your trash where it can be eas
ily reached and handled. Shreveport has
outgrown her old dress and needs a new t
clean and beautiflu one.
Let us work together to get her one.
Thanking you for your attention and I
trusting this appeal to the better part
of you is not made in vain, we are yours
most sincerely for better, cleaner, more b
beautiful Shreveport, C
