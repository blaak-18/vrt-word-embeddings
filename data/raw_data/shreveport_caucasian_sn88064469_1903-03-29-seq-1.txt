FUTURE OF DEMOCRACY.
THE VIEWS OF SENATOR STONE
OF MISSOURI
And Senator Carmack of Tennessee.
Nominee for President Must Be a
Strict Party Man-Rejects the
Name of Grover Cleveland.
The Washington correspondent of the
Picayune in a special of recent date
says:
Senator William J. Stone of Missouri
has this to say about the Democratic
national platform for 90o4:
"I can not anticipate the action of the
convention next year. This I will say,
however, that I discriminate between a
principle and a policy. Questions which
concern the organic form of our govern
ment, or which affect the personal lib
erty of the citizen, are questions of prin
ciple, while purely administrative ques
tions-such, for example, as relate to
the currency or taxation-are ordinary
questions of policy.
"I never did see a Democratic plat
form which "did not, in my judgment,
contain some things that ought to have
been left out, and which did not leave
out some things that ought to have been
put in. But I always take the platform
and stand upon it, because, as a whole,
I have always believed Democratic plat
forms to be right, and because they rep
resent the concensus of party opinion."
"I can not, or, at least, I prefer not,
to discuss these things or to make pro
phesies as to 'paramount issues' for
I9o4," said Senator Stone:
"I shall favor a platform both pro
gressive and aggressive. I want the
Democratic party to get in the front of
things and lead. Conservatism is not
without its value. I believe in being con
servative and prudent, but I want the
Democratic party to be more than a
mere restraining force. I want it to be
an affirmative, suggestive and directing
force. A position of mere negation does
not appeal to the progressive spirit of
the age. The world moves, and we must
move with it, if we would have a hand
in directing the current of events. Our
party must be distinctively a construc
tive force. We must propose negotiations,
t be done-great ,things that challegge
, .se good--to
the cutry, and an increa-__ se of nataua
power and prestige. We mast command
the d~qidence of the great world of bus
iness ahd enterprise.
"'This is a commercial age-too much
so, no doubt, but it isa fact. Growth,
progression is what the world is striving
after.' We must keep' ii touch with the
spirit of; the age, so that we may better
direct the course of events on lines as
nearly right as possible. This is no time
fia a slow. Coach. What we shall put in
our platform, or leave out, what poli
cies we shall, as a conse'vative party,
attem.ptto develo are thingsfor- thisk
ag men to think abot. We must mork
to the fron."
"I do not care to discuss indiviuals:
No, I do not think Mr. Bryan -will be
nominated, nor do I think he either ex
iacts or desires the nomination. If any
v9ort is being made to eliminate him it
ll fail, for he is still undoubtedly the
idp wO(smmaading individual force in
the p.arty. e can not be eliminated and
any e.Frt in this direction will recoil on
those attempting it. The business of
'elirinating apeople fromn the party is not
the business I want Democrats to en
ige in.-t would be. more proitable tod
getmeen into instead of getting them out
of the party.

.would make safe, conervative presi
Ldets, and gvsernt well, although they
h not induge in such erratic stren
urositias as would keep the country on
li tipt oft lso adne dread eipectancy. On
this u.-st of men I make but ope re

THE READY AND THE HANDY
PISTOL.
The sensational report of the raid on
crap shooters in a tent near the Kansas
City Southern yards recently was start
ling. Two negroes, one Moss and one
Peterson, were shot in the onslaught by
the police, who claim they met with re
sistance and had to shoot in self-protec
tion. The statement of the police must
be accepted, but there are instances on
record where similar raids have been
successful and not a single man hurt.
The two negroes shot are well known
in Blanchard and Mooringsport and
throughout Ward Three of Caddo par
ish and have the endorsement of good
citizens. Indeed it may be said that it
was Mr. E. C. Hearne, who on meeting
Moss in Blanchard, the morning after
the shooting, persuaded him to return
to Shreveport and go to the Sanitarium
for tre~hnent. Moss had reached Blan
chard during the night on a hand-car
propelled by some of his friends. In his
statement to Mr. Hearne, Moss said he
was shot while sitting on a cot. At any
rate he was shot, and for a while it was
believed fatally, but he is improving and
tay ýecover.
The purpose of this article is to urge
caution on the police. Perhaps there are
men on the police force who may be too
ready with the handy pistol. A police
man is provided with a club to resist as
saults which may be made against him,
and his pistol is intended as a protection
to his life if assaulted with a dangerous
weapon of any kind, a. it is also to
check, if possible, a fleeing prisoner
against whom there may be a change of
felony, but the ready and handy pistol
should not be pulled- or used in simple
arrests or in enforcing the ordinances of
the city. While the negro at times is
noisy, yet, if not a desperado, he will
submit to arrest if he can not escape,
and it may be cited that Deputy Sheriff
Worsham when a policeman has effected
the arrest of five or six negroes and
marched every one to theX lock-up. The
same may be said of Officer Bounds who
not long since arrested several negroes
and unaided marched them to the sta
tion. In fact there are other officers of
the police who have a like record, men
who never use their gun and would not
'think of making a gun play except in the
protcti. their life or to secure a
p with serious crime who
was about 1i' escape. We again urge on
some policemen the important necessity
of always ,being cool and self pos.essed
Ind to never pull out or use their gw-. s
except it must be, and then if it must
be, the law and public sent'mcnr will
protect the, officer.

UNVEILING CEREMONIES.
MONUMENTS DEDICATED T 0O
WOODMEN OF THE WORLD.
Ceremony Will Take Place Next Sun
day Afternoon in the Old or
Sprague Street Cemetery.
On Sunday next, April 4, two monu
ments will be unveiled in the old cem
etery on Sprague street. The two monu
ments will be dedicated to Sovereigns
Caperton and Laenger of Broadaxe
Camp No. 16. On such occasions the cer
emonial is always imposing and inter
esting. Besides the provision for the
widows and orphans, it is an obligation
of Woodmen to have erected at the head
of every grave of a Woodman a monu
ment to his memory. On Sunday next
the unveiling of two monuments will call f
the Woodmen together. As programmed
Broadaxe Comp with Sand Beech Camp
will meet at Woodman Hall on Texas
street at 3:30 p.m., and from there with
Retig's Band will march to Maple Camp,
on Texas avenue and from thence will
go to the cemetery where there will be
singing by a quartette of which Sover
eign L Parker of Broadaxe Camp is
the leader. It is needless to say that the
numbers, w.lh lhWifliiv is rtjrsed by
this quart tte will be most exQtkisite. On
this occasion Hon. J. . . Shepherd of
Maple Camp will deliver the oration,
which ,no doubt will be a treat to the
Woodmen and the spectators. The ladies'
of the Woodmen Circle will also be in
attendance. It may be said that the an-.
veiling ceremony next Sunday will be
one of the most pleasant features asso
ciated vWith Woodcraft

Brewer assistant. Itx will be their duty
to take charge of the line of march and

STHEDISTRCT COURT.
In the district court, Judge A. D.
Land presiding, the following cases were
cosidered:
Frank Bodenheim, inflicting' wound
less than mayhem; tried by jury, guilty
as charged and recommended to the
mercy of the court; $5o fine and thirty
days in jail.
Tom Hardy, attempting to corrupt a
juror; continued.
Ed McGuire, et al., violation of Sun
day law; plea of former acquittal taken
up and sustained. Defendants were dis
charged.
Frank Serwich, violation of Sunday
law; pleaded guilty; fined $5o or thirty
days in jail.
Phil Drauss, et al., keeping a banking
game; tried by the court; discharged.
Nick Hangicos, shooting with intent
to kill, tried by jury; sentenced to one
year -in the pen.
Will Monkhouse, carrying concealed
weapons, discharging firearms on.public
highway and trespass; not guilty; dis
charged.
Mike Good, murder; arraigned, plead
ed not guilty; prisoner was remanded to
jail.
The Ruston Progressive Age quer
ies: "Has or - levee system proven a
success?" etc. The answer may be given
intelligently after the flood; but the ad
vocates of outlets are strengthened in
their opposition to an all levee system
by the several breaks in the levees and
by the reported cutting of the levee at
Hyn.ela, forty miles above New Or
leans, which was suggested, as alleged,
to-relieve other sections menaced by
weak levees.

A NEGRO LYNCHED.
Frank Roberson Confessed to Burglary
and Incendiarism.
A few days since a negro named Frank
Roberson was lynched in Arkansas near
the Louisiana line. He was an old of
fender, a bold bad man. The story is
soon told. About three years ago a store
at Walnut Hill, Ark., was burglarized"
and fired. Among the contents of the
store were two shotguns, one of which
was found recently in the possession of a
man who on being arrested stated that
he had acquired the gun by purchase.
With this clue Roberson was apprehend
ed and a rope was placed around his
neck. He pleaded for mercy and con
fessed that he had burglarized and set
fire to the store at Walnut Hill. He ad
mitted that he had committed several bur
glaries and had burned a number of
store houses, among which was Belcher's
store in Benton, incinerated several years
ago. Having admitted his guilt it was de
cided that he should be lynched, and
after a short respite he was jerked to
thee limb of a tree, from which the body
was found dangling. So has ended the
career of a man who for years evaded
arrest and had set all law at defiance. He
was a menace to any community in
which he lived or located temporarily.
