rsams Age.
SFew men die of age. Almost all
Sdie of dappoltmeat. passion, men
dsal or b l, toll or aeident, The
. passions I men sometmes very
suddenly. The common esprssoa,
" choled witb plassion," has little
a aggeratlonn t; for even though
not suddenly fatal,, trong passions
o shorten life. btrone bodied men
often die young. Weak men live
." longer than thestrong, for the strong
use their strength, and the weak
g huve none to use. The latter take
care of themselves, the former do
not. As it is with the body, so it is
ir with the mind and temper. The
d strong are apt to break, or, like the
Sandle to turn. the weak to burn out.
bhe inerlor animals which live, in
I general, regular and temperate lives,
live generally their subscrlbed term
Sof years. The horse lives twenty
five years; the oz fifteen or twenty;
the lion twenty; the dog ten or
I. twelve; the rabbit eight; the guinea
11 pig si or seven yeas. These num.
bers nall bear a similar proportion to
the time the animal tae to grow to
its full size. But man, of all the
t animals, is the one thatseldom comes
b up tothe average. He oght to live a
w hundred years acordg, to this
, pholoc olaw, for ive times
twnty are one hundred; but instead
e of that he scarcely reaches, on an
SaIvng, ftour times is growing pae
