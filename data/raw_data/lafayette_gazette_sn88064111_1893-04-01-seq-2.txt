we The Mougan City Advocate re
Sn ports that Mr. Jsacques Lehman is
y finding that the steam capacity of
ks his canning factory e not sufficient
Be to meet the demands made upon it by
e' the large oeders that are poutring in.
- His first shipment was for Tyler,
td Texas. New Orleans will receive
g seo cases; a carload is ordered for
ir- Galveston, and 3oo cases are billed
for California.
is This reminds the writer of an in
t cident occuring in Houston, Texas,
a. about eighteen months ago. Seeing
r- a pile of boxes canned vegetables in
ri- front of a grocery store, he noticed
in the shipper's brand read : "
on Rienzi, Miss.," and the thought at
ill once occured to him, it some far ois
n factory could can and ship those
sa- goods to Texas, why could not south
ad west Louisiana, wherhethe lands are
er so well adapted to the cultivation of
all kinds of vegetables? His curios
-a- ity being aroused, he started out to
in ascertin, and did, where is, and
In what kind of a place was Rienzi. It
of is a small town of about soo people
at situated in the extreme northern part
ro- ao the State. This factory is oper
in- ated by a family of seven, who must
im can many boxeu to ship as far South
of as Texs.
S"We learnt further that these peo
n- pie had induted the small neigh
boring farars, to abandon cotton
ll indate f vegetables. Instead of
mcel tlising about s4 an acre as for
i aserly, they saw their ands bring
o them over $35 an acre with less labor.
-t The result has been that the factory
m, people are mrhaking moey, and the
orn farmers are making money. And
for rall are contended.
o Now, there is no good reason on
der the sum why a factory right here
rt in Lafayette should not pay hand
ad some returns.
try And we are going tohave one, one
to of these fine mornings.
