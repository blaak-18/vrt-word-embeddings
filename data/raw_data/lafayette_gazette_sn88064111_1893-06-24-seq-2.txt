SYSTEMATIC EFFORTS.
It is admitted that there has been
mo systematic effort made to bring
the merits of oar rich soil, genial
clinmate, and other material advan
sages before the world of home
seekers. Except in the instance of
she Southern Pacific railroad and
the Watkins syndicate, no effective
efforts have been put forth, and
thea eompanies have been instru
mnental in bringing in a large immi
gration, but these efforts have been
confined to Calcasienu parish. That
parish is to-day settled by a thrifty
and intelligent set of people, just
that kind-that make the prosperity
Ofia country:3 From being-way down
is the scale that parish is to-day
well up, and all because her peo
ple have spent the time and means
necessary to correctly inform the
world, just the sort of country.
they have got.
We do not believe the state
anent that the lands of Lafayette are
by far more fertile and better
adapted to the growth of a larger
variety of plants, can be successfully
controverted, yet for every immi
grant that stops in our parish, Cal
casieu receives fully Soo, and the
season lies in the fact that they know
absolutely nothing of our lands.
No one can with justice feel jea
bous of Calcasieu; she deserves every
immigrant that steps within her bor- t
ders, because she has gone after a
them, and she should reap the bene- t
fit of her labors. d
In penning this article we simply l
wish to show that the prosperity of I
the parish depends entirely on the
efforts of her people, and that the t,
mention of Calcasies is for the pur- f
pose of showing that her growth and ti
prosperity came, not by any element j
of chance, but solely by intelligentn
effort on the part of her people, and tt
teaches a lesson well worth emula
tion. of

THE ASSESSMENT. Q UES- th
TION. tA
To equalize assessments so that of
every object upon which it is placed am'
will bear equal and exact propor- St
tions of justice, without detriment
to any, has been a vexed question 'in
and a source of annoyance to the tc
assessors who mean to do their duty
strictly according to law.
But it seems the law is of such a R
nature that in spite of the best in
tentions some injustice creeps in,
but to what extent in the aggregate
it is hard to say. It has been de
monstrated by some newspapers in
the State that while the small land
owner pays taxes on a full valua- em
tion of his property, the large and ts
rich land owner generally escapes of
with a moderate assessment. Some M
time since The Gazette read a state- R.
ment wherein it was alleged that the COI
pal
assessment placed on a large estate res
was $1o an acre, and on the resi- 'me
dence, costing $5000, at only £rooo; 1
while on the other hand, a small eXt
Ste
farmer owning So acres was as- rut
sessed at .ro an acre and on his set
shanty costing $300, the amount C.
was fixed at $25o, a proportion out to
of all reason, There may be many hie
such instances throughout the State we
for aught we know. It is in just tiol
such cases where the wrong creeps rc
in, and it is to correct this evil that
the press of the State are agitating
a discussion having in view the
creation of a law that will make as
sessments uniform upon the value
of property.
It is not lbo much to hope that
the legislative commission recently
appointed to suggest neede4 amend
mnefts in the organic law of the
State will find it within the scope of
their duties to pay some attention
So tlij important question.
A system that will permit a reas
enable assessment on the real value
of property world, no doubt, prove
an efficacious remedy to the present
difective manner of reaching a true
and correct assessment on actual
values.

Carencro Public School Picnic.
The basket picnic given by the.we
teachers and pupils of the Carencro
School on Thursday June z5, proved Fr
a most enjoyable event. As a gen
eral thing children succeeded in an
getting the most pleasure out of such La
occasions, but in this instance the
parents, and invited guests, seemed He
as happy and contented as the little G.
ones. ret
Mrs. E. 1V. Glean, the talented
principal of the school, was untiring Th
in her efforts to see that all enjoyed as
themselves; and she certainly suc- ab
ceeded most admirably. he
The picnic party left town at
9:3o a. m. A number of large to
wagons were fairly loaded down with
children, their light and pretty cos
tumes, and sweet smiles, formed a
most stril~sg and pretty picture. thc
After a pleasant ride talong a . road E.
skirted on both slides with beautiful ant
plantations of cotton, corn, and Ic
sugar cane, the happy party reached be
the Carencro springs, where they
decided to spend the day. And a lik
