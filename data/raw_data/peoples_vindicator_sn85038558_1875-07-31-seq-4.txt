WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
Champions American Comic Paper !
Illustrated by a corp. of the best Ameri
can artists, iand( contrilbuted to by the
mnost lopular humlorists and satirists of
the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the established hitimorous an(;
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as a
monthly, thein, to satisfy the demand of
the publie, it was changed to a fortnight
.ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting folly as it flies; and showing up
the political and social shams 'by its
masterly cartoons anti pungent editorials,
it achievtd even greater success than
be:fore, :ald was recognized as thl ablest
and brightest of its class. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
demand, and now punllish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
ing the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to fuitrnish illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth. Hopkins,
Walh', Sheiion, Wolf Jump, Keettels,
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to famle.
Ini its literary departments Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satiric'al,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will ho first-class in every
partiCular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fai
tidious.

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegnr Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VIxrEGAit BIT
TERs ." Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of `V,
EGAR BITTERs in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a geintle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of Dn. WALK
ER'S VINEGAR BITTERS are Aperient, Din
phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious, Laxa
tive, Diuretic, Sedative, Counter-Irritant,
Sudoritic, Alterative, and Anti-Bilious.

poison or other means, and vital or
gals w steir oeyond repair.
Bilhous. Renlittent, and In
termnitteit Fevers, which are so
prevalent in the valleys of our great
rivers througho throughout the United States,
especially those of the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, Arkansas, Red, Colo
rado, Brazos, Rio Grande, Pearl,
Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, throu.h
out our entiro country during the
Summer and Autumn, and renmarka
bly so during seasons of llntusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting :t
.powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs. is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the putrpose
equal to DR. J. WVALKER'S VINEGAR
ITW'riERS, as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the samute time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy lime
tions of the digestive organs.
Fortify the body against dik
ease by purifying all its fluids withi

and a hundred other painful .~ymptomls,
are the offsprings of Dvyspepsia. One bot

merits than a lengthy Iadvertisemlent.

constitutional Diseases, WALKKI'8 V .1

intractable cases.
For Inflamnmatory and Chroe fe
lhenmatism, Gout, Bilious, Remit
tent and Intermittent Fevers, Diseates
ofthe Blood, Liver, Kidneys an8l Bladder,
these Bitters have no equal. Such Dis
coaes are caused by Vitiated Blood.
Mechanical Diseases,-rerso n.
engaged in Paints and Minerals, such as
Plumbers, Type-setters, Gold-heaters and
Miners, as they advance in life, are sub

worms, Scald-head, Sore Eyes, Erysipe
las, Itch, Scrufs, Discolorations of the
Skin, Humors and Diseases of the Skin of
whatever name or nature, are literally
dug up and carried out of the system in a
short time by the use of these Bitters.
Pin, Tape, and other Worms,
lurking in the svystem of so many thou
sands, are oeffectually destroyed anhd re
lmoved. No system of nmedicine, no ver
miluges, no nnthelminities will free the
systeml fioln wormns like these Bitters.
ForFemnaleConmplaints, in young
or old, married or single, at the dawn of
womanhood, orthe turn of life, these Ton
ic Bittersdisplay so decided an influence
that imlprovemlent is sooni perceptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated .Bloo
whenever you tind its impnrities bursting
through the skin in Pinmples, Eruptions
or Soresa; cleanse it when you find it obh
strneted and sluggish in the veins; cleanse
it when it is foul; your teelings will tell
you when. Keep the blood pure, and the
health of the system will follow.
