III of the driver 's
when going «bout at
ids, und turns a most per
f«ct furrow, seven inches deep, aud
nine inches wide, or wider and deep
er, or otherwise, as desired. There
can be no crooked furrows, no ban Iks,
and bo gmund ontofned, and if tbe
first back furrow is laid ont properly,
the whole fleld will be perfectly well
plowed, lu Mr. Grower's plan of
etarting the furrows in stubble land,
there is no strip of unplowed land
left beneath the back furrow, as is
usually done, nor ia there a rid ^e
left to show the btck furrow. He
first plows a farrow perfectly Jlraight,
l»y the ose of the marking stake«.
Tiie plow is then ran beneath this
furrow-shoe, which is turned back
into its former place, with the earth
w hieb was beneath it. now above it,
and both together foriuiug a ridge of
perfectly mellow earth, as deep as
the reftt of, the plowed ground will
b»>. Tho other furrows are then
turned each way toward this one,
leaving the " land " without any
ridge in the center of it, and every
portion of it perfectly well plowed.
This is a small thing comparatively,
hut oue well worth remembering aud
practiciug, This plow its made near
Glasgow, Scotland, and was imported
by Mr. Crozier, at a cost of about
$100. Being entirely of irou, it is
nlmoHt indestructabie, aud although
its weight is considerable, yet it*
draft is very light ; throe horses
working it with ea^e, and plo-.vin^
two acres in nine hours. The Am cri
can plowman, however, would rather
ride with bis plow than walk behind
it, aud to suit his inclination, n
variety of double plows mid gang
plows with a seat for the driver, are
made both at tho East and West.
Tho lands at the West nre peculiarly
fitted for the use of these double and
guug plows, which are inndo for
breaking prairie and plowing so l or
stnble. Gangs of four or tive_plows
are in use in the easily turned soils
of California, and double furrow
plows nt least, would be found of
greut utiliîy upon prairie farms.
The prime necessity for Western far
mers, is cheaper production, and h
plow that will turu two to four acres
n day, or do double the work of a
oouiuion plow, with but one addition
al horse, wi 1 reduce the cost of
plowing almost one-half.
(7* Job work of all kinds will still
be done at this office at panic prices.
Wo shall continue to run that branch
of the business at fifty per. cent, less
thau it can be done for elsewhere.
