It has been announced froth \Vahing

oili because of his rare hnt blcatVse fie
peopei of Charleston are firm iii their
contuntiln that a man m1re siitihic for
the position shou. t he appointed be Mr.
Roosevelt. I)r. Crum i< of the class of
colored people who are educated and
have reached a standing in life which
gives them rccognition and advantages
over the less fortunate of their race. and
it is with Dr. Crum is with men of the
Caucasian race. In the appointment of
lar. Cruim, President Roosevelt irritated
an antagonism. which lie should have
Mnollified. In Charleston there are no
doubt white men who are good and tried
Republicans who can fill the appoint
mient creditably. Why not name one of
them? In time Mr. k1{osevelt will learn
a thing or two: he will acquire some ex
perience; and he will realize tha he can
not ram a nigger down a white man's
throat because he is President of the
United States. The rejection of Dr.
Crum is an indication that there is left
in a Republican Senate some apprecia
tion of the right of the people to object
to an appointment by the President.
POLITICAL AGITATION.
The political agitation in Louisiana
will soon become active and the issue
will not be so much on the selection of
Governor and State officers but on how
the nomination shall be made. The great
majority of Democrats who vote are in
favor of nominatiofu by primary elections
against the convention program which
is manipulated by a chosen few in the
interests of a few, the exclusive benefit
and welfare of "the select," the favored
slated regardless e the expressed
wishes of the peotple. When the eam
paign opens po these lines there will be
a warm and heated political atmosphere`
about the few who, in the future. may
venture to manipulate the convention as
in the past, according to their own sweet
will and as they see fit. Then there will
be a kowl and a kiek which may raise
tite roof from the Democratic temple of
Lotuisiana.
A Russian oblenan was sent to jail
in New York city for expectorating on
the pavement. Some friend should in
form him that it apocers to be mntch
safer to expectorate in the direction of
the Monroe Docdrine, The foreign no
blemen who do that are nut sent to jail.
They are asked to arbitrate.-The Com
moner.
The foreign noblemen may epeeto
rate in the direction of the Monroe Doc
trine and escape a licking by Uncle
$ass; they may expectorate on "a per
lieman' in New York, but nary one
- would venture to spit tn 'a sidewalk in
Shreveport under a penalty of $r4o.co
fine or a hundred days on the rock pile.

with a double veil of mystery and false
hood. aito they achieve their ends by
duplicity, circumlocrtion and deception.
The time has come to put an end to this
sort of international politics. To the
devil with tortuous diplomacy and su
perannuated. diplomats.'
"Mnr. Bowen is a shirt sleeves diplo
mat. but lhe is also an able international
lawyer, able to meet his trained oppo
nets at every point. It has been said of
him that he believes that duplicity is as
inexcusable between lonest nations as

friendship between his native land and

The Cninmoner. lrevn os paper, i' "A
( ill to \ri i " says:
"1)emocrats vho are 1)emocrat. from
principle should assert themselves. Not
on'l is it their tint to do vn, but they
nied to do so if they woold save the
paret from disaster and dcmoralization.
Reports from evcry section of the contn
try make it certain that those who hft
the party in tsi96 under the pretense of
opposition to hunietalhisin are making a
systematic effort to regain control of
the party with a view to placing it in
the position it occupied under Grover
Cleveland's administration. in this they
are being aided bfthe less extreme rep
resentatives of the corporation element
that voted the ticket for reglarity's sake
without endorsing the platform. These
elements do not work openly and hon
estly, but covertly and through agents
who,beg for 'harmony.'
"It is time that loyal Democrats were
aroused to the danger confronting their
party and its principles. It is time they
were organizing to combat the insidious
inflitences at work within the party to
republicanize it and make it acceptable
to the corporation interests. for a Dem=
ocratic party that espouses principles ac
ceptable to the trusts and the money
power is Democratic in name only. Only
thorough organizaticn will be effective
against these undemocratic influences.
This work of orgahization should begin
now and be prosecuted with vigor. The
best way to go about this work is the
organization of clubs within the party
in every voting precinct in the country.
Miss Alice Rooseveft, daughter of the
President ,will attend, the Mardi Gras
in New Orleans this season. Wonder if
she would be offended if the colored so
ieety of the.-Crescent City should try to
niopoliz her? Thy would be warrant
ed in such a step by the predilections of
her daddy.--Ruston beder.
The insinuation is as ungenerous as
it is uncomplimentary. Miss Roosevelt is
not responsible for the idiosyncracies of
her iatherand when in New Orleans
she will be welcomed antl entertained as
a lady worthy the esteem. of ladies and
