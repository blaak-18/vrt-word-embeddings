When we get to congress.
Are you going to congress pa
No, no. I mean when our rep
resentatives get there.
What does the platform say pa (
Oh, it re-affirms the platform of
1892.
What was the platform of 1892
pa(
Come, run off and play now I'm
busy.
But, I want to know what you
re-affirm.
Well, let me see, well we demand
the free coinage of silver, the abo
lition of a high protective tariff,
the repeal of the ten per cent. tax
on state banks, rigid economy in
public expenditures.
Aren't the Democrats in power
now pa I
Yes.
•And your platform is going to
be the same again this year as it
was two years ago I
Yes.
If you demanded and affirmed
that all those things should be done,
why, when you got in did you not
do them I
Oh, well you see it was this way.
We couldn't do it for
Is it a fact, pa, sure enough, that
you didn't do any of these things
you promise to do I
Well-a--no, not many. There,
run off now my head aches.
Did they vote to repeal the ten
per cent. tax on state banks 1
No.
Did they vote on it at all I
Yes.
And voted it down after promis
ing the people to repeal it I
Yes.
How did the vote stand pa t
One hundred and two in the
house voted to repeal the tax and
172 voted against it.
Yet the house was democratic by
86 majority over all !
Had the people changed their
minds since the election and deci
dad they didn't want the tax re
peeed O
No.
And you say, pa, that these dele
-ts in eongres that were elected
to repeal the 10 per cent. tax, sad
that promised faithfully to do so,
aetually voted not to do it when
the time eame by 70 majority I
Yes.
Wbhm congress adjourns these

entitles hin to a re-election.
No-I
lie wont get many votes will he,

Why. yes I guess he will.
Shall you vote for him, pa?
Why, ah see here. I'll raise welts

I won't say anything more about
Bynum, pa.
Well see that you don't.
Didn't you say, pa, that the
country needed more money, and
that stopping the coinage of silver
made money that much scarcer ?
Yes, it was a foolish thing to do
to stop the making of money right
in the midst of a panic that was
driving men to the wall by thou
sands.
Did the democrats vote to stop
the coinage of silver dollars t
Yes, Bynum among the rest.
HIave the Dinnocrats reduced ex
penses, pa ;
No, not unich,
Have they any?
No, not a cent.
Did they increase them any?
Yes, they had to issue *50,00c.
(M ) of bonds.
It was against the law. too,
wasn't it pal
Yes, I guess it was.
They reduced the tariff, didn't
they?
No, not yet.
Are they going to?
Yes, if they can.
What is to hinder a majority do
ing what they want to do ?
Why the Republicans andl a few
Democrats in the Senate are deter
mined to keep a protective tariff on
coal, iron, sugar, collars and cuffs.
Do you really think the Demo
crats in Congress want to reduce
the tariff?
Yes, of course I do.
Because they say they do?
They said they wanted to repeal
the ten per cent tax on state banks,
too, didn't they, pa?
Why-yes, but
Did the Republicans keep them
from doing that?
Yes, of course they did.
How could they when they only
had 126 members to the Democrats
#20?
Oh-I-mean-that--say, go off
now, I'm sick, I
Oh, pa, what is the matter ?
Shall I go for a doctor ?
No, no; I mean, I'm not very
sick-I
Now, pa, to sum up: The )Dem
ocrate have not redeemed any of
their promises. In fact, they have
voted against what they most sol
emnly promised their constituents
they would vote for. Not only
that, they have incresmd expenses,
and plunged the country $50,( M),
000 deeper into debt. They have
extended the time of paying the
whisky tax to eight years. This is
worth million, to the whisky trust.
Now they are trying to extend fa- 1
vors to the sugar trust worth tens
of millions of dollars to it, which, 1
of course, comes off the people.
With this kind 'of a record, pa,
how can you vote the Democratic
ticket this fall 4
The Republicans are just as habed.
Yes, I will admit that, but there
is a party that is not.
i'ht! do you think I'll vote
with the eranky Populists?
Why do you think them cranky
Because I do.
Is that the best reason you can
give .
No; they are anarchiste.
How do you know they are?
Becaus-a--beause they are

SENATOR JONES' LETTER.
The Reasons Why He Leaves The
Republicans and Joins
The Populist.
(Sifted through the Shylock channels of
the Associated Press.)
The following is a synopsis of
Senator Jones' letter giving his
reasons why he has left the Repub
lican party and joined the Popu
lists:
~1ASHINGTON, I). C., Aug. 29.
To the Hion. Enoch Strother,
Chairman State Central Committee
of Nevada-e-lar Sir: Having be
come fully convinced the Republi
can party organization is unalter
ably opposed to the free coinage
of silver at the American ratio of
164 to 1, or at all except with the
consent of foreign governments
and at a ratio to be dictated by
them, I have to announce that I
can no longer act with this party.
Expressions of the regret he
feels at the step followed, he pro
tests that he "abates not one iota
of his conviction with reference to
the beneficent influence of Ameri
can industries of the policy of pro
tection. But he thinks protection
will do us no good unless the sup
ply of money is made to keep
pace with the demand. Scarcity
of money is accompanied by an
artificial fall in the price of conm
modities. The Republican party,
he says, has, up to this time, been
moving in the direction of an in
creased currency. But the repeal
of the purchase clause of the
Sherman law was the parting of
the ways. While the Democrats
must share in the responsibility for
that repeal, it is only the action of
the Republicans with which he is
concerned. The Republican party,
he says, repealed a law of its own
making on the demand of a Demo
cratic President.
Senator Jones scoffs at wnat he
calls the international bimetalists.
A remedy by international confer
ence he pronounces impracticable,
and cites British testimony to up
hold the claim.
The money question, he protests,
is one of these greet issues justify
ing a new formation of parties.
If all free silver men voted to
Sgther, there is no doubt a free
silver President would be elected
in 1896. It can only be done
through a new party. The oppo
mants of silver have pointed out to
as prelisly what we ought to do.
When they- deternmied to repeal
the purchase clause of the law of
1H90 they ignored for the nonce all
other:issues. forgot the struggles
and animosities of a third of a cen
tury, shot their eyes to tariff cam
paigns and to exhausting struggles
with force hills, together with all
the bitterness such occasions re
call, and joined hands without hesi
tation for the accomplishment of
their common purpose, not aban
doning hut holding in reserve their
differences. HIe continues:
"In other words, they forced for
the purpose and for the time a
third party. That purpose accom
plished they immediately restored
the statu quo and returned to their
differences. They voted in Con
gress as one party in their repre
sentative capacity. We should
vote at the polls as one party in
our individual capacity. All who
believe in the predominence of
monetary reform should, in my
opinion, come together on that
issue, and for the time being hold
in abeyance their convictions upon
other questions-reserving to them
selves the right to read just their
party relations when the monetary
question is settled and other issues
come to the front. History teaches
that while reforms of a minor
character may be accomplished
through parties formed for the
achievement of other purposes no
question of the first magnitude-
no question involving a great fun
damental principle operating in the
interest of the masses of mankind
-was ever settled without the crea
tion of a new party to achieve it.
In the immovable conviction that
the progress, prosperity, and hap
piness of not only the people of
Nevads but of those of the entire
country are more immediately de
pendent on monetary reform than
upon any other issue that can be
presented for political action I
shall henceforth vote and act with
the party that brings this over
mastering issue to the front."
Yours truly,
JoHN P. JONES.
We suggest that the new bonds
be redeemed in wheat. Wheat is
good, and is recognized as being
more valuable than gold in every
market in the world.-Buzz Saw.

much talking, but the result shows
