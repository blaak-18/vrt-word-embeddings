You pushed those judicial nonii

, that wour Associated Press lied.
o are you( ? Well, honest confession
a is good for the soul.
We agree with you most hearti
oe ly that the Peoples palrty is gain
m- ing rapidly in the North and West,
Iand will give you another hit of
i- news that your Associated Press
lied about: "In Colorado last
II month the county elections showed
r 7tl) Populist majority in the
i State."
n Now then if you will only in
it vestigate a little further you will
:, find that you are quite as ladly
mistaken alout Polulismn in the
I South as you have been about it
e in the West.
I Suppose you write to the Sec
retary of State in Mississippi for
the Populist vote of that State
fandt publish it in your columns. It a
will not hurt your ppler to pub- t
- lish the truth, nor will it make a
the cause of your rotten party K
c worse to know the real strength of a
c your opposition. t
e We can tell you this much ahbott f
SMiississippi. Notwithstanding the r
r fact that Populism was indor.sel
e bythe Icimocratie party m that i'
SState, antid the National Dmuera- r
a cy denounced, we came within 201 I
votes and less of carrying over 1 li
ountiee m the State. a
SIn other words, we made the u
I Democratic party do right, 'and
I then came very near defeating the (
party, and the Populists there are
well satisfied with the result. r
The Democrats have nmne States I
iout of forty-five in the Union in a
which they have not been defeated *
in the last two years.
Au Illlutralmen.
It requires but one brief exam
ple to demohish the silly lposition
that a voter being illiterate, there- i
fore unfit to vote, the possession hi
of $2(0) worth of property would 01
put him in toed standing as a vo
ter. Suppose under the new dis
pensation Mr. A. owned a mule is
valued at two hundred dollars, he It
would he allowed to go right on p
exercising the rights of citizens th
ship, until some fine. day the ani- I
mal would die just before an dee- ci
tion. That would shut Mr. A. it
out. Now the question arises e2
which of the two were the voter, pl
the mule or its owner ? It rather ci
looa like it was the mnle.--Con- of
