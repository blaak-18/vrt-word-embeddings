that only 6100 were appropriated to

weat up that most have made the
"beest talent oand tie oely brains in
the State," as that reoreant Assembly
had been termed by its warm parti
sane, quake Is their boots.
Governor Nieboll developed a
policy, early Is 1827, which for politi..
cal lunacy stands without a parallel
in history. One paper: aloe ins Lou
pian daeonaced that polieg a crime.
One paper alone propehtically mailked
step by step the ruin that policy
would.bring to our citiseans and the
degrelation it was certain to entail
upon our commonwealth. That pa.
per was tbhe Viotniron.
For daring to do right; 4 warm the
people of the danger, we were de.
aonaced at every term as a hot head;
am implacable; a Botsrbon. The press
of leusasias woere either silenot as
the grave the, or assailed us in uon
measrted terms. .
To-day, whes the evils of that
policy are aalicted and past remedy,
the howl against Goveror Nicholls
is deaferingi Every scribbler hI the

or boaor, aredeadened with the clam.
