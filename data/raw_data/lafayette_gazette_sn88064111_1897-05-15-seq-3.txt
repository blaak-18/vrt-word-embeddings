Reflected in the Papers of this
Great State.
While the bill as reported to the
'Senate is not what the Louisiana
planters expected, it is much better
than the. Wilson bi.1, and we be
iirit a T ` lwl i re a fpir rate of
proteetion, still it fs not a .law and
the House maj yet demand a com
promise which would no doubt re
sult in good for the sugar industry.
We believe, all things considered,
that it would be unwise to antago
"ize the Senate measure, unless
something should develop later.
We all know that the vote in the
Senate is very close, and the Demo
crats are already exerting them
selves to defeat the bill when it
comes to a vote, consequently it
would be much better to accept a
-compromise than to have the new
tariff law defeated altogether. -
Franklin Vindicator, Rep.
The perennial and irrepressible
conflict between the Louisiana Re
publican factions for the loaves and
fishes, of Federal patronage goes
merrily on, and President McKinley
is confronted with the same fra
grant exposition of political dirty
linen that is thrust under the nose
of every Republican president at
the beginning of his administration.
The struggle is a tripartite one this
time, the contending forces being
divided into the Wimberly, Herwig
and Leonard clans. - Donaldson
ville Chief, Rep.
The Progress is glad to see so
many papers and people endorsing
the views on the outlet system it ex
pressed five years ago, when it first
s ed" on its career. We con
-_ded.then and do now, that the
all-levee system is the most costly,
devastating experiment Congress
and the people ever adopted. It has
ruined thousands of well-to-do
people and destroyed hundreds of
thousands of dollais worth of
valuable lands.-Shreveport Prog
ress, Dem.
The announcement that the de
fakIlting bank officials out in Chicago
are to be piosecuted is rather sur
prising to them. They were under
the impression that the hard work
they, performed last year for the
preservation of the nation's credit
would' give them immunity from
petty litigation of this nature.
West Baton Rouge Sugar Planter,
.Dem.
Our object is to impress every
wearer of pants with the fact that
the BUCKSKIN BREECHES are
the best working pants made. We
put a printed guarantee in the
pockets of each pair, so you can
get your money back, or get an
other pair, if you find they are not
exactly as we say-best in every
way-fit, finish and wear.
