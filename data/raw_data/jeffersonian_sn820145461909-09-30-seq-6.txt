DEFENDS CADET BOOKER.
Dear Sir: —In the Jeffersonian of
September 9th, in the editorials of
Mr. J. D. Watson, I notice he has
considerable to say about the findings
of trial in the case of Lieutenant
Sutton, which I very much agree with
him and, as he says, just about the
time the case was about to be re
opened, his brother, who was a cadet
at West Point, was brutally hazed,
for which several of the cadets were
suspended from the academy.
Now, Mr. J. D. Watson says one
of those cadets happened to be a
Georgian, and he hopes the efforts
that are being made to get him re
instated will fail.
Now, as I understand the case, the
Georgia boy, Mr. J. H. Booker, Jr.,
was not one of the Sutton hazers at
all, and the court records show that
he was not discharged for hazing any
one, but that he, in company with
a superior officer, did allow some
upper class men to make some lower
class men get on their all-fours and
race like horses and auction them
off to the highest bidder, a thing
they all enjoyed alike, and so trivial
in its nature that all alike thought
nothing of it. Now, Mr. Watson, I
have been a very great admirer of
yours and a strong supporter, having
voted for you every time I had a
chance, and as long as you advocate
the principles of true democracy, as
I understand them, I expect to con
tinue to support you, knowing as I
do it has caused the finger of scorn
to be pointed at me on several occa
sions, but I am willing to stand that
for which I believe to be right. But
the point I want to make with you is
this: Mr. Booker is my personal
friend and near neighbor, and I know
him to be of unimpeachable charac
ter, and although he and I differ po
litically, I am not only willing to do
him justice, but help him in any way
I can to get him reinstated, and
knowing you as I do, I ask you not
only to withdraw your statement of
hoping this excellent young man will
not be reinstated, but do everything
you can to get him reinstated, for I
assure you he is as of good parent
age as any member of the academy,
and to blight his future for a trivial
offense seems to me an outrage.
Hoping again that you may use
your best influences in Mr. Booker’s
behalf, I remain,
Yours in the fight to the finish,
JAS. M. PIPER.

WE NEED MORE FRIENDS LIKE
THIS ONE.
Dear Sir:—l drop you a few lines
to let you know that the magazines
and knives got through on time, and
they are all O. K. Markley and I are
as proud of them as a darkey with a
new shirt. I took myself off
to the city of Muncie yester
day and showed my knife on
the streets. Was making a dis
play of it when a Methodist preacher
passed and said to me, “Well, I sup
pose there is going to be another
Populist convention, as you are in
town.” I took him by the arm and
made him look at my knife. He read
all that there is on it and said that
he would like to see you in the Sen-
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
ate. So, Mr. Watson, the people up
here in the North are getting to know
you are a live wire.
We Pops up here are doing all we
can to increase the circulation of
your paper. I have several men on
my string that want the paper, but
money is scarce. But if they don’t
get it soon I am going to advance
them the money. Anyway, I am go
ing to have more of your papers
coming to my office before cold weath
er. I would like for you people in the
South to know how the church is
run in the North and how the people
are hoodwinked out of their money
for Foreign Missions. It makes one
blush with shame to hear them.
There are some things in the North
that you ought to write about.
I am going to send for some of
your books this fall, so that I can
have something to read this winter.
Yours truly,
O. L. ROSS.

Dear Sir:—l beg to advise that I
thoroughly endorse the plan of se

Mr. W. S. Williams, of Ralston,

time that it is put into effect.
With best wishes for yourself, as
well as your efforts, I am,

VIEWS OF A REFORMER ON
ORGANIZATION.
My Dear Sir: —I very much ap
preciate your expression of apprecia
tion of what you please to term
“uniform and serviceable friendship
displayed for The Jeffersonians”.
In this letter I wish to express
my views as a reformer as to our
future mode of procedure in bring
ing about reforms, such as a gov
ernment of, for and by the people,
would exact from its county, district
and state representatives.
We should know no political par
ty, but retain our varied people’s or
ganizations, for without organiza
tion we can accomplish nothing. Let
us let each individual be the judge,
after hearing what evidence he can,
as to what is genuine Democratic or
Plutocratic organization, as the case
might be. Let us hold the balance
of power when we can do no better,
but if possible to unite enough or
ganizations on any one plank or
planks to elect, let us design to se
lect candidates on this plank or
planks that are patriotic to the
cause; and let us also design to se
lect these candidates from organiza
tions that are influential and suc
cessful and to which is attached the
less prejudice in the mind of the
masses of the people, but let the
candidates run independent of any
and all party organizations.
It is to be hoped that the Ameri
can people have not lost their love
UeffersonUa
and enthusiasm for that which our
forefathers fought so bravely for,
namely, independence. Now we can
fight with the ballot. Soon we will
have to fight as they did with other
implements of warfare.
I, for one, love my country and
will do all I can to prevent her flag
from going down into disgrace.
Yours very truly,
CHAS. W. MIMS.

THE KIND OF LETTER THAT
PLEASES US.
Dear Sir: —I have the pleasure to
send you two new subscriptions to
your Magazine, and also renewing
my own subscription. If you would
like to know how I like it, will say
I have never read any magazine
that pleased me so much as yours.
If it was in every home it w’ould
open the eyes of people. Hoping
you will long be able to keep up
your good work, I am,
Yours respectfully,

A JEFFERSONIAN “CONVERT.”
Dear Sir:—l have never subscrib
ed for your paper, but, through the
kindness of some friends, have been
receiving and reading it and like you
very much indeed. I have been a
steward in the M. E. Church, South,
for 30 years, and all this time have
been contributing my money to For
eign Missions. But you have opened
my eyes, and if it takes our money
and the virtue of our American wom
en to save them, then I, for one, am
in favor of letting the whole push of
them go to H .
Send me your magazine also, and I
will send you check for both.
Respectfully,

THE YOUNG MEN’S NATIONAL
POPULIST LEAGUE NEEDS EN
COURAGEMENT AND FINAN
CIAL ASSISTANCE.
Dear Sir:—lt gives me much pleas,
ure to inform you that our League is
meeting with remarkable success.
We have already several young men
in different counties who are attempt
ing to organize county branches of
the League, also several papers have
kindly offered aid in our movement.
All that we need at present is funds
to carry our movement to success.
So I ask that you write and publish
an appeal to the people in this week’s
issue of the Jeffersonian for funds,
which they will send to me at once.
I have also decided on a badge, it
is this: A badge with a picture of
Thomas Jefferson on it —at top this
word, “Reform”—at bottom, Y. M.
N. P. L. Don’t you think this would
be a very appropriate badge?
Thanking you again for your aid,
I beg to remain,
Yours very truly,

INDIFFERENCE AND IGNORANCE
OUR WORST ENEMY.
Dear Sir:—l received the knife O.
K. and it is fine metal and nicely
finished, and well worth a dollar to
me.
Your editorials on Foreign Missions
are timely and to the point, and the
hit dog doth howl and squirm.
The missionary fanaticism and
graft is bad, bad enough to cause an
gels to weep, but there is a more dead
ly evil growing all about us. You
see it and combat it like a Hercules:
I see it but can do little or nothing
to warn the sinking people of the
doom to which we are hastening. I
refer to the stolid indifference and
besotted ignorance of our people re
garding our government. If there
was one vitalizing drop of the blood
of our old grandfathers coursing our
veins, the passage of the Aldrich in
famy would have raised such a storm
of indignation and wrath, that the
perpetrators of the crime would not
have dared to meet their outraged
constituents. But what do we see?
Absolute indifference, superinduced by
wilful ignorance. They won’t read
anything that would enlighten them.
Sincerely your friend,
OLIVER S. JONES.
I was so disgusted with the labor
ing man’s vote in the last presiden
tial election 1 haven’t recovered yet,
and now some people want the name
of the party changed. Well, Popu
list is good enough for me. When
the Populists commit half as many
crimes as the so-called Democratic
party, or the Republican party, I will
then say, “Smash it”.
Our friend that keeps nagging at
you by wishing that you and Bryan
and Hearst would get together, ought
to be suppressed. With you and
Bryan and Hearst working together,
wouldn’t there be trouble? Imagine
you tied up in all W. J. B.’s policies,
especially his negro policy and mixed
schools and national bank guaran
ty! Lord save the country from Bry
an and his policies. j-tj <r
As ever your friend,

REFERS TO THE LADY WHO DE
FENDED MISSION METHODS.
Dear Sir:—As I have closely fol
lowed your writing on the Foreign
Mission question please allow me to
congratulate you on the way you have
given us the facts.
I have just finished reading your
reply to Miss Janet Hay Houston.
No question, the verdict is yours.
I would ask all subscribers to read
and re-read the article, because it
vitally concerns the American people.
I wonder if the lady comprehends
how completely flat ner argument has
fallen?
Allow me to remain,
Yours very truly,
F. L. WESTBROOK.
Columbiana, Ala.
Ed. Comment: I regret to report
that Miss Houston is still joined to
her idols. In fact, she wrote me a
hot little letter which, in some re
spects reminded me of a ripe pod of
red pepper.
She says that argument, however
lucid, would be lost on me, and that
what I need is information. My
well-meant effort to give her some
was a dismal failure.
