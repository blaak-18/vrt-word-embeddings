Extremes are generally radical and
'lash easily when they meet. It is the
conservative, the soler sided who, after
all, bring harmony out of chaos. The
conservative spirit, when moved by a
%ense of equity and justice will not be
come entangled with, individuals or per- bi
sonalities of which they should take no
concern, in endorsement or condemna
tion. It may be a trite saying, but it is a1
nevertheless true: "Let every tub stand b
on its own bottom."

ri
'Whale. In the Thames. a
Iu former times the appearance of a ri
whale in the river Thames was consid- a
ered ominous. One was caught of
- Greenwich three months prior to the a
th of Oliver Cromwell, and the con.- c
men opiatn was expressed by Heath
in his "Flagellum." 'It pleased God,"
be remarks, "to usher in his end with
a great whale three months before,
June 2, that came up as far as Green- r
1 wlch and there was killed." Evelyn, p
a In his "Diary," under the date of June b
8, 1658, mentions that a whale was I
killed off Greenwich and that It drew c
an "InOnite concourse to see it by wa- t
ter, horse, coach and on foot from Lon
don and all parts." According to Rob
r art Hubert, in his "Catalogue of Nat
p'al Rarities," the tongue of this whale
was exhibited daily for some time at
the "Miter, near the west end of St.
Paul's church."
In February, 1857, another whale
wasg aught in the Thames, and In the
thes of that month appeared an ad
y .etsement for a piece of ground, some t
40 feet by 60 feet, "on which to exhibit
a whale." The piece of ground adver- 1
tited for was found In the Mile End
}eed, and the whale was exhibited un- -
W Larch 14. In the same month
susely. on March 21- expired the
hoeas of commons, which had been
wlees In 1852.

MORGAN'S DENIAL'
Alabama Senator Says He Did Not Make
Assertion Ascribed to Him. 01
Washington, Feb. 18.-There was no
debate on the statehood bill in the sen
ate Monday. The Indian appropriation
bill and the Philippines currency bill Bt
both were passed. Mr. Vest just be E.
tore the Indian bill was passed called fo
attention to a point of order which had ed
been made against one of its provisions de
on the ground that it was new legis- th
lation. -The senate he said had passed he
the Philippines government bill as a av
rider to the army appropriation bill A<
and yet ruled other provisions out. All th
rules, he said, were yiolated when a at
majority was in favor of any measure. er
Mr. Carmack introduced a resolution la
authorising the committee on Philip- th
pines to continue its investigation into er
conditions in the Philippines. On ob- p(
jection of Mr. Lodge the resolution at
went over. se
Mr. Morgan spoke on a question of at
privilege regarding the dispatch which
recently appeared in the public prints
purporting to be signed by the Colom- sl
blan minister to Mexico, Senor Rafael V
Reyes, in which Senor Reyes took ex- ai
ception to an alleged statement by Mr. a,
Morgan in the senate on Feb. 12 that s,
the Colombian president had sold out ft
and abdicated for $1,000,000. ti
"I did not say," continued Mr. Mor
gan, "at any trine that the president
had received $1,000,000 as pay for re
signing. I said that after he received
$1,000,000 in April, 1900 he retired to b
his home and the vice president was is
substituted in his place." p
Reverting to the subject of giving d
out information concerning executive s
sessions, Mr. Morgan eaid: "It is on- c
ly a repetition of the crimes that have r
been committed by senators hereto' a
fore."
It was not an unusual thing, he said, a
but no such accusation could be laid at c
Hhis door. c

Mourse of p*epreeatatives Passed a NuU

Washington, Feb. 18.-The house b
disposed of a number of bills Mon- c
day under suspension of the rules. The a
most important measure passed was
the senate bill to amend the railroad e
safety appliance law. A special order
was adopted which practically will
make the Fowler currency bill a con
tinuing order for the remainder of the
tneion, not, however, to interfere with
tonfoeretice reports, appropriations or
Other privileged matters.
