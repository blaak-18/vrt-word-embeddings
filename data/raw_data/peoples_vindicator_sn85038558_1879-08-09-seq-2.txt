The Ceinlg Canvass.
Democratic at all times and under
all elrcumstances, the VINDICATOR
will do what it can tosecure the unity
of the party. As an earnest of what
may be expected of us In the future,
l we bave only to refer to our past ef
7 forts !n behalf of party discipline
and for party success. It Is our firm
belief that Louisiana's present con
dition-her escape from the rule of
to the vicious and depraved-Is due en
and tirely the unselfish efforts of unsel
, we fish Democrats. We speak now of
i of the success of those measures and
policies of which we are about to
enjoy the fruit in a new, vigorous
h and liberal Constitution. It is not
our purpose to deal In vituperation
against or panegyric of men many
aim of whom have and do mistake the
age In which they live, and insist
u1* that parties are not for the public,
the but for them.
ney There need be no apprehenrsion of
the whereabouts of the VINDICATOR
in the coming canvass. Our posi
c tton and the confidence we enjoy, to
gether with our record as a Demo
cratic journal, give us the right to
or- speak and we will do so now, unhesi
by tatingly and candidly.
We recognize the fact that differ
ted ences exist in our ranks in this par
et Ish, to which we would not call at
tention were we not sure they could
be healed. None of these differen
ted ces, In our opinion, are founded upon I
let causes which should divide patriotic
)u- people; and it we, of Natchitoches, I
have not endured, in common, enough I
of the Ills of bad government to
aly make us patriotic, no people can i
ite claim such distinction. We believe, I
ner also, that a separation for a very <
he trivial cause may In the end, it per
slated in, disrupt a party; we believe t
the causes for our differences trivial;
id- so trivial indeed, that proper and
ºbt mutual concessions will heal them
it, effectually.
We have heard it said that party
leadership is objected to. There is
Sno patriotic man in the party who ,
i will not at once retire to the ranks,
t should one man, even, object to his
be leadership.
We have heard It said that certain
be "Slates" are already made for of
g fcers. We do. not believe it, and if C
It were so we would depreeate and
denounce any effort to control the 1
k party organization by any man or
set of men for personal ends.
a We have heard it said that certain
men were to be ruled out of the par
ty. We repel such an insinuation as
unworthy of credence. The party p
cannot afford to discard the services
Sof a single madi. Every Democrat
has proven his fealty by subordina
tion the dark hours of his party's e
- travail; it would be the rankest in- .
gratitude to discard him now. Be. ld
r sides, every man has an influence, d
e great or small, and we are not so
vulnerable In numbers as tobe ready P
to alienate a single voter.
r- These, we believe, are the com
Splaints made by Individuals agnlast b
Sthe party. They are easelly satised.
" But the party has also certaulin dutles
d to perform before it can command
8 popular respect. These duties none
butthe blindest of partisanse will tame
ly see violated. The party must nomi- t
nate, if It hopes for success, not
only Goon Mu--a vague virtue at
Sbest- hbut capable men, true men,
and above all, men of unbounded
persmonal popularity. No individual,
no faotton, has the moral right, how
ever mueh he or it may have anumeri
cal power, to thrust upon the support
of theparty any man or set of men rei
Slacklng any of those eoentials, to
Swhlhb command strength and aInsure fr4
Ssuocses. The party as a whole must r
be consulted. Its best men must te
Sput their heads together and outline bo
a policty upon whleh we can all stand cii
and do battle. ea
Besides these inside differences a Co
spirit of ladependenee-Mso.called- en
prevails, which is enoouraged by a j
SmIsemingr hotility la our party, and jo.
whleh, If not compromised must ln- to
jure us serioously. It is best to be all
candld and look the matter ain the th
efae as it stands.
We believe this independent move- In

misunderstandin. We believe it L
can be eradlicated. It cannot be b
done, however, by violence and vitu. lie

The Debt tealcd.
-r Superflelal observers are apt to
) jump at strange conclusions. We
hear it strongly urged against the
Y "debt settlement" that it does not
"cut deep enough to satisfy the peo
pie," when, in truth, It CUTS DEEPER
than any "iaealing" upon which a
majority of Democrats could unite.
The debt as it stands under tIe
4 Constitution of 1868 is, in round fg
. ures, $12 00,000
1. Interest (j 7 per cent for
f 35 years, 29,400,000 k
4 Total Debt and Interest, $41,400,000
The Debt Ordinance as agreed up
on for submission to the people by
the Democrats in caucus, recom-.
- mends the following settlement:
, Face of the Debt, $12,000,000 tl
t 2 per cent Inter't 5 years, 1,200.000 c
3 " " " 15 " 5,400,000 r
4 " " " 15 " 7,200,000 t
Total Debt and Interest, $25,800,000 C
This scales the debt and Interest t
from its present volume, $15,600,000, a
or62:32 per cent; while the only
Iscaling which could have ever see
cured a majority of Democrats was u
25 per cent off the face of the debt,
12:68 per cent less than that propos
ed by the sestlement.
It is for this reason we announced gt
our full and free determination to
sustain the action of the Convention a
throughout. Bitter, and almost fa- d
tal feelings at one time prevailed in dh
the Convention, which those attend- h
ing could alone appreciate, and we
were joyed beyond expression when tb
SEVENTY-TWO DEMOCRATS co-opperated b
in this adjustment, which in our
opinion saved the Democratic party w
from defeat, and secured the people de
the model Constitution of the Union.

Can You See Through This!
(N. Y. Sun, July 29th.)
There can be no doubt that the
' Democratic party, both in this State
- and in the country at large, without
Stbeing reduced to desperate straits, is
just now suffering under some em
barrassmente.
To place first the more general and
'r comprehensive troubles which em.
I barrass the party, it must be admit
ted that the largo number of seces
sionists nlcluded in its ranks natu
rally enough causes its unionism to
be distrusted. As far as we are con*
cerned we can only say that while
we are radically democratic in all
our notions of government, we are
- content to see the head of every man
.who attempts secession by force of
arms put where that of John the
SBaptistwas so cruelly placed. We
are for the Union, first, last, and in
the middle. We are against seces
sion at iall times, in all placese, and
under all circumstances.
SFurthermore, we believe in fer".
vently cherishing the memory of tae
dead who roied for the Union.
We cannot concede to the rebels
more than an honestly mistaken t
sertiment of patriotism. t
We believe the difference, even in
death, between dying for a right
cause and dying for a wrong cause is
very great, and that it will endure
forever, because in its very essence
it is indestructible.
If the National Democratic party
is enabled to overccme the feeling
against it on account of the large d
number of former secessionists in .
its ranks, it will be by the full and f
frank adoption and proclamation of
such sentiments as we have now ex- t
pressed.
Ourdistinguished metropolitan con- t
temporary is assured by us, in behalf '
of the rural Democracy of this South.
era section, that (1) we surrendered S
to the Union forces in April, 1865; (2)
we did soln good faith-that is, we
renoueed secession, took the oath
of allegiance to the Union, and in- tI
tend to preserve it inviolate. (3), we b
dent talk, think or dream of seces. d
sion dows here; (4) we never asked
a judgment at any one's hands, as to
whether ours was or was not a "mis.
taken sentiment;" (5) we are per.
feetly willing to "mourn for our own
dead," and have never asked you to
the funeral, and never Intend to; (6) t.
and finally, we are perfectly willing s.
to allow the National Democracy of Ei
the sun's sort to get along without n
our assistance-if they can. We E

The Atlantilc"Paclc Canal.
M. Leseeps, the celebrated French
Engineer to whose energy and abili
ty the world owes the Suez Cattnal,
has, after surveys and estiniates, de.
cided that a waLter route from the
Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean is Iprac
ticaOble, through tihe I ,thmu or l',
nama by Canal. Against this the
American newspapers, in the interest
of the Northern Pacific and other
trans-Continental railroals. have
reared a furious war. The HERALD,
SUN and other journals, particularly,
denounce the enterprise, as "Leeseps
Job." We trust the public will not
be deceived by the apparent attempt
to cover the opposition to an enter.
prise of this character, which must
redound to the benefit of our ship
ping interests all over the United
States, by dragging up the old Mun
roe doctrine.
The people of this country, we are
sure, want the Canal as a ma*ter of
pure business and ilnterest, while the
Munroe doctrine is a sentiment r f
the most ephemeral character. We,
of the South, are more, larticularly
interested in its consatruitii, and
our leading i.jmrnals should urge it
with all their power.
The New York HERALD reads a icc
ture to Mr. Kelly, the Tamnkany
leader or New York. The HlELD
pronounces Mr. Kelly "an honest"
man-working for the good uf his
party, and through it, the people.
The IIEIrALD closes its article in this
way:
With tact, with good management,
with courage and shrewd views, Mr.
Kelly, you can gather your legions
and defeat Mr. Tilden in theConven.
tion. The democrats of this eity
can, i' they are wise and bold, and if
they want to, easily carry the State
Convention. Show the democratic
party that you are laboring for its
success, while Mr. Tilden is working
only for his own; that is the way to
success. Carry the Convention and
you may make the State democratic
in November, and in any case you
will have united your party and will
have rid it of the rule of the one
man whose predominance would
surely bring it defeat next year; the
one man whose rule or ruin policey
stands in the way to-day in this State
of democratic harmony and success;
the man who has always shown that
he regards the party as his property,
created for its use and to advance
him, and who, as everybody conm
pr4ehends, will look placi;ly on at its
defeat and ruin whenever it no lon
ger subsexves his private purposes.
The way to secure democratic sue.
cess in this State, Mr. Kelly, is to
put Mr. Tilden "out in the cold," 0
andl you cal do thaIt 0ou try.
And if that is dI--who knows ?
- we may have a democratic Presi
dent yet.
