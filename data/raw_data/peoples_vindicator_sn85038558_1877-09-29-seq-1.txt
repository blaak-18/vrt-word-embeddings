Chicago, September 13,-The Times evic
Rockford (Ill.) special gives Wade law
Hampton's speech before the WVinne- war
County Fair to-day, of which the fol- rnd
lowing extracts are made. Mr. liamp- you
ton said: cep
Mr.Presidena an4d( y Felkl-citi:ens war
of lllinois: If any evidence was whli
Ineeded to show the high appreciation bef,
in which I hold the invitation which I
brings me here to-day, it would sure- con
ly be found in the fact that I have hav
travelled more than one thousand Ivlo
miles that I may make my acknowl- Iv
edgements to you for the honor you for
have conferred in person. [Applause.] the
And let me say to you, and I say it
with infinite pleasure, that had that Noi
journey been far longer, had its fa- con
tigues been greater, the sight that us
greets me here to-day, and the car- ta
diality of the welcome given by the st,
people of Illinois, would have amply n,,
compensated me. [Applause.] [lb
Under ordinary circumstances I pre
should scarcely have felt at liberty to a
have left my official duties to parti- ed
cipate in an occasion of this sort, how- oi
ever gratifying the honor might have lin
been, but the invitation of the Winne- as 1
bago Agricultural Society carried ma
with it such weight .that it imposed ter
upon me an obligation which I felt I full
could not neglect. It was the Soci- thi
ety that a year ago--before the poli- in
tical spirit which has now so happily ,e
subsided had abated-was among the ani
first to inaugurate that spirit of re
conciliation which is now spreading Iv
with such wholesome force over this wt
land of ours. Therefore, when they 11n1
made a call upon me, I as a Southern we
man felt that it was not only my plea- cw:
sure, but that it was my duty, to go fro
and wake a response to them in per- lIt
son, and thank them for their course pa
in the interest of harmlony, and to ter
pledge my cordial co-operation in cit
this patriotic and noble work. [Ap- shi
planse.] le
If I comprehend the purpose of nu
your invitatieon to me, it was not that till
1 I should speak to you merely upon W
agricrltural subjects, but that I should otl
discuss those graver and broader is- lii
sues which are distracting tile counr st
try. But, my friends, in doing that tel
you need not fear that I shall violate su
the proprieties of the occasion by c
giving you a political speech. I shall St
I shall speak to you for no man, for
no party, nor no section, but for the
whole country. [applause] ; but in o
doing that I shall strive truthfully st;
to sink all men and all partisanship, S
and to place myself upon that grand, of
high plane, where true and puie pa- il
triotism can be foiynd. [Applause.] As ze
I construe the motives of tilts move- be
ment, my friends, it is in the interests to
of peace. Understanding it so, it was
j that brought me here, and if by any w,
thing that I can say or do, if I can in pf
the slightest degree assist these gen- al
tlemen in the noble work that they or
hIave inaugurated, then my friends,
my mission has not altogether failed. I
The chief thing I had in view in 10
coming here was to promote a tru rte
and correct understanding between
the people of thile North and South.,
You must admit that very many of
tine evils which have fallen on the o
country have come from a misconcep
tion of the purposes--eachl of the other.
SYou remember there is a profound
" truthl, as well as a knowledge of hu
Sman nature, embodied in the fable
where it Is told tlhat in olden times a
r shield, whlite on one side and black tl
on the other, was hlung at the inter
cection of two roads, and two Knights b
- approachling in opposite directions, n
', disputed as to the color of thile shield. e
7 Finally their lances were potjn rest, I
and thiley periled life each to support a
his own convictions. It has seemed
to me, in looking over all tlhese ques- I
t, tions, that something of thile same sort
k- happened between the North and
er South. The Constitution was the
shield, viewed as it was from diffe
d rent points and constructions. The
est dispute upon the point waxed warm
by er and warmer; the sword was called
1e in, and under its real arbitrament
. amny a brave and true and knighlty
r- soldier laid down his life in support
of his convictions. What might have
happened, my friends, had prudence
and not passion ruled the hour, it is
useless for us to say now. Thle states
man looks at thile past perils of this
country simply that he may guard
against them, and the prayer and
work of thile patriot should tend to
thile same end.
My friends, I speak for the South.
SWe of tile South have not only had
enough, but tod mnuch of war. [Laugh
, ter.] \We seek peace. We come now
to plead in tile interest of peace; and
it is for that I im hIlere before you to
day. [Cheers.J Can you doubt, my
ed friends, that tile Sotith wants peace
ke Go look at her tiulned fields, thile mis
n 1 rule under which she has lived for
twelve years5 and you will doubt it
P- no longer. Do you, men of Illinois,
* doubt her sincerity Slhe has been
charged with faults; but amng these
faults her worst enemies hlave never
said shie was hypocritical, or thlat sihe
spoke with a double tongue. Impeti
ous, rash, she may be; but thank God!
ess false, never! [Cheers.] Do you
itn want proof of her sincerity I Look
in thile recent past and tell me if you
can find assurance more conclusivre
_ thian is given by her conduct t Need
I tell you to look back to those try
ing days when the Presldpntial con
S test was unsettled What was the
course of the South then a
Governor Hampton alluded to the
le possibility of a civil war, in which
he families would have been destroyed
had not thle South stood firm for
r. peace, and said:
I tell you of Illinois, and I seak
not as a l)emocrat ; I don't know and
don't care whether I speak to Demo
crats or Republican ; I speak as an
American to Americans, and I say to Ter
you to-day, you owe a debt of credit
to the people of the South [cheers] in T
Congress, to what some of the North and
have called ''the Confederate brig- Wa
ade," who prevented fillibustering ly s
and stood by the result of the Electo- rose
ral Commnission's work. I)uring tile hil
recent strikes and riots, too, she 187:
evinced her feeling by upholding the mei
laws and standing conservative. She ihan
wants you, people of the North, to fle
understand her condition. She wants bah
you to realize precisely what she ac- Mo
eepts as the result of the war. She it it
wants you to understand the motives life
which have actuated her, not only of
before and dui lug but since the war. the
I, for myself, nmy friends, have no cha
concealments to make for the past, 1 gro
have taken part in the war, not
would yortr respect for me increase
were I to offer any unmanly apology
for it. I did what you did. I obeyed
the command of my own State, as
you did yours. And you, men of tie tie
North, were guided by your own
consciences, as we of tile South were tai
guided by ours; and I say to you te
that iup to the begip ning ,of that war I
used all liy itillnence to preserve the I
Union. Cheers.] I was a 1'Uion mian. ves
[Renewed che-ers.] I did all I could to par
preserve it ; I did all I could to avoid ha'
a war, and when South Carolina call- t
ed her sons, as Illinois called hers, I VeC
obeyed her command, and, men of 11- the
linois, I fought you as long and as hard
as I could, and I have no apologies to I
make for it. [Loud cheers and laugh - ton
ter.] I remember, especially, that I vat
fought the Eight Illinois, and I
thought it one of the best regiments
in the Fl:deral army. I fought them mo
very hard indeed, [Great cheering St,
and laughter.] a1
Now, my friend, we went into the his
war believing we were right ; but
when the war ended we surrendered tlic
and I want to impress that upon you; ter
we surrendered in good faith ; and I Tti
challenge a man living to say that thi
from that day to this that I have vio- on
lated in any degree the tenor of my at
parole, or done any thing inconsis- f
0 tent with my honor as a soldier or at
citizen. [Loud cheers.] WVhen I to
sheathed my sword I renewed my al- till
legiance to the United States Govern
ment. I pledged myself to support
Sthe Constitution of the United States.
n When I took my official oath, the fey
other day, as Governor of South Caro- Ti
lina, 1 swore to uphold it as it now Sc
stands, and, so help me God. I in- tel
tend to keep it. [Loud cheers.] We be
se urrendered in good faith. We ac- ea
cepted the constitution of the United, TI
States with the amendments. 'rthougl pr
we opposed the latter, we accept them tl
now, and propose to obey them, right pi
n or wrong-that the Constitution shall ed
y stand equal for the protection of to
ý Smuth Carolina and of Massachusetts, ed
of Illinois and Louisiana, and we
have the right to ask that every citi
zen in every State should be equal
before thle law and under the Consti
tution of the States. I Cheers. o
S So much, my,friends, for the views of
we entertained. Then we come, ap- A
pealing to you for peace. We come i
appealing to you, because it is not la
' only the highest wisdom to restore
peace-not only because it is states- p
manship-not only because the very fr
o theory of statesmanship and politics f
Srequires the restoration of peace-but K
nwe appeal to you because it is the
very mainspring of patriotism. And
if there is any-where the mauinspring
of patriotism, moving strong and per
petual, it is the hearts of thIe people
r. of Illinois.
d Governor Hampton, alluding to the
Sstory that hie had been threatened, I
e treated the matter jocosely, eliciting s
Smuch mirth, and read a letter statingA
k that 100(K) veterans at Rockford had n
Sconstituted a Committee to send himI r
Sback front helre in a box. The re- i
i mainder of tile speech was devoted to I
eulogistic allusions to the State of a
t, Illinois in regard to its aigricultural
t advantages, to a predictlio of a glo- e
d rious destiny for the Mississippi V'al- d
Sley, to a brief allusiou to the labor a
nt question, and to a plea for universal a
ed education. lIe concluded as follows :
S "We are standing under one flag, r
'e obeying one Constitution ; and it is t
for us to say what will be the future
- ofthisecountry. Give us your hellp,t
d and we will give you our hoarty co
ntoperation. We feel and know that
if tils is done-if we can have a res
t toration of fraternity--if we can make
Sthe people of this country understand
c each other--we feel, then, that there
Sis a glorious future before the whole
on otry. We canr make It so-we
d can make it so by each and all of us
d performing, in his allotted sphere, his

has abandoned now even a pretotse
of pr'osecuting the attempt ngainst
'lhevna and fallen back into the po
sitionis occulied here before the com
mIencement of the honmbardnient. The
lield artillery remains still in the
same positions of the bomihardmnelt.
It is announced that a third removal
is intended on the arrival of the im
perial guards in a fortnight. I have
gleat doubt whether another attempt
will be made, and a very much
stronger diulibt whether if it will be
made it cani succeed. The Turks
are better soldiers individually than
the Russians, and after seeing not a
few battles I stand assured that the
strategy of major and minor tactics
of the Turks are much immeasurably
superior. They are better armed
than the Russians, both in great and
small arms. They have engineers
who can designate admirably defen
f sive positions. The Russian engi
Snecrs sCeem incapable of repairing
even a hole in a buidge. The Turks

t sians and are flushed with success.

. lina, and the other ex-officers of the
State associated with him in the in
hr indictments lately found, aro innocent
of the charges, they ought to be able
to establish their innocence without
: difficulty. They are not to be tiled
by a caucus or a hostile Legislature,
bulnt in open court, where evidence
will be allowed in full weight. There
nwas a vast amount of plundering go
ing on in high quarters from 1865 to
1872. The State lost heavily. The
Legislature was from year to year a
nest of foul corruption. Some of
these men who are indicted must
. have known how it was. We hope
ee they may be able to clear their own
to skirts. Iiutthe fact that they were
is Republicans at that time, and are
.t still so "stalwart" as to look upoin
the President as a traitor, will not
