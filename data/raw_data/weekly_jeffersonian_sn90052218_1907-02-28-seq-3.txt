Those Americans who are aching to
see the United States and Japan go to
war are now turning their gloating
eyes to poor little Honduras and Nica
ragua in hopes to see them fall to pull
ing each other’s hair. It’s a pity that
these Central American toy republics
haven’t sense enough to behave them
selves and to devote their time to the
arts of peace for which nature intend
ed them rather than to the art of war,
for which they are poorly equipped. It
would be a good thing for ail concern
ed —and to us —if they would unite
with the Mexican republic, becoming '
an integral part thereof, but reahy
that’s too good a thing to hope for. So
they will go on, ad innnitum, yowling,
spitting, scratching and going through

NOTES ON LINCOLN.
Some Recollections of the Martyred
President in Civil War Days.
(From the New York Tribune.)
President Lincoln as he impressed
a girl not yet out of her teens was
the timely subject of a paper read by
Mrs. Mary Coffin Johnson at the
monthly meeting of the Daughters of
Ohio in New York, held yesterday af
ternoon. Mrs. Johnson herself was
the girl, and her paper was made up
of notes which she jotted down at the
time.
“Married at seventeen,’’ she said,
“I was fond, like many other girls,
of taking little trips to Washington.
Like a school girl, I was given to writ
ing down in my diary the things I
saw and heard, aud I made careful
note of every time I looked at Lin
coln.
“The first time I saw him he was
standing up at his full height, calm
and unconcerned, apparently in an
open barouche, opposite my door m
the street of a southwestern city.
The carriage moved slowly, the street
being blocked by masses of people, and
I, like every one else, gaped at him
with all my eyes. Unattractive he
was in his personal appearance, un
polished, with no pretensions in his
manner to superiority, and yet some
thing about him, something in his dig
nity and simplicity and the strong in
dividuality of his presence, impress
ed me very deeply. And I was not
easily impressed at that time,” Mrs.
Johnson remarked parenthetically, “by
any serious person.
“Lincoln was a thorough Kentucky
an in appearance. At the time of
which 1 speak his national reputation
was a matter of months only. He
had no thought at that time of inter
fering with slavery in the states where
it already existed. He had won the
high confidence of his party and a reu
utation for wisdom and telling oratory
by his speeches in his controversy
with Stephen A. Douglas; and now,
being newly elected to the presidency,
he was on his way to the capitol to
take his seat. Even then many of the
states were wavering, signs of the
coming conflict were visible, but none
of us dreamed as we looked at Lin
coln how serious the conaict w’ould
be, nor that we were looking at the
great protagonist to be.
“Three years later I was in Wash
ington. My first glimpse of him there
was at a formal function, where I
had the pleasure of a handshake and
a brief word from the president. The
following Sunday I sat but a few yards
away from the pew which the presi
dent occupied at the New York Ave
nue Presbyterian Church, and I was
struck by his careworn look, by the
lines which the past three years had
drawn in his face.
“Near the close of January, 1865, I
went again to Washington. With our
party were several men who repre
sented a noble, unpaid charity which
the cival war had brought into exist
ence, the United States Christian Com
mission. These men had an interview
with President Lincoln at the white
house by appointment, and 1 was al
lowed to accompany them.
“We arranged ourselves in the great
east room, and after a little delay the
president came in. We rose to our feet.
George H. Stewart, president of the
commission, addressed him, speaking
< the trust the people had in him and
alluding to the sympathy be had shown
the poor fellows in the southern pris
ons, and thanking him also for the
aid the commission had received at
his hands.
“The president stood with clasped
hands, tall and gaunt (that familiar
descritpion is really the only one that
fits his figure). He was even more
haggard than when I had last seen
him, a year before.
" ’You owe me no thanks,* he said,
‘for what I may have been able to do
for you, or for our brave men in the
field, and if I may be permitted to
say it, 1 owe you no thanks for what
you are doing so well. We are alike
working for the cause, and It is be
cause the cause is just that we find
joy in the work.’
“Then the president shook hands
with the members of the commission
and asked the party to come into the
blue room. He wanted some “person
al conversation,’ he said. I remem
ber him as he sat in his chair, in the
same awkward position made familiar
to us by the pictures of him. He con
versed with the same freedom ne
would have shown if he had been mak
ing a neighborly call back in Illinois.
“Two evenings after that there was
gathered at the capitol one of the most
distinguished assemblies ever conven
ed in America. The members of the
diplomatic corps were there, and the
cabinet, including Secretary of War
Stanton. Schuyler Colfax was present;
so were James G. Blaine and Admiral
Farragut, in full uniform. The occa
sion of this meeting was the anniver
sary of the united States Christian
Commission, and its special feature a
discussion of the dreadful conditions
of tne soldiers connned in the south
ern prisons. Presently President Lin
coln cuiue in, followed by two ouicers,
and slipped into a seat in a row occu
pied by 'plain citizens.’ The most
telling recicais were the ones made
by Chaplain C. C. McCabe (afterward
Bishop ivicCabe), and by a war corres
pondent, A. B. Ricuardson, wno but a
snort time before nan escaped from
tue Dansbury stocxaue in Norm Caro
lina, and alter weens of wandering
in tne mountains had finally reached
tne union lines. As Mr. Kicnarusun
stood and mixed, so weax from nis
experiences tnat he had to enng to
a table for support, 1 saw President
Lincoln’s arm go up to his eyes.
“During tne evening rhuip Puillips,
at tnat time a weii-xuown smger aud
composer oi nymus, sat down at me
piano and sang a song which nad late
ly been written, ’lour Mission.’ Tne
president toox a scrap of paper from
his pocxet aud wrote a note, wmeh
he UauueU up to me chairman. After
ward i saw mat note, it was: 'Near
close of evening let us have Xour Mis
sion” repeated by Pniiip Puiiiips.
Don t say i called for it.’
“The song was rendered, and the
chairman announced that it was by tne
request of one wuo»e authority was
not to be questioned.’ Us course, ev

The British Vice Consul at Rouen
reports tnat the cultivation in franco
of the new potato brought from Uru
guay nas been observed for some Umo
with great interest. The variety is
called “Solarium commersonall violet,"
is said to possess excellence of taste
as well as nutritive value, and is
equal to the best table pota.o known
in France. This varle L y is distinguish
ed by its resistance to frost, as also
to disease, and its one great advan
tage is that it prospers most in a damp
and swamp soil, wheer no other kind
of potato w'ould grow. Every kind
of soil, whether clayey, calcareous, or
sllicious, seems equally adapted for its
culture, provided it is damp.
