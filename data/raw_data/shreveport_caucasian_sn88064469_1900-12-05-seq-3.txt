NOW WITH CONGRESS
Report of the Isthnian Canal Com
rniý,ioni Handed in.
FAVORS NICAJAGUA.
The Estimnete CoOt Is $200,610,000
and Includes New Plans-Mr.
Delliver Is Now Senator in
Place of Senator Gear.
Washington, Dec. -The report of
the isthmian canal commission submit
ted by the president to congress gives as
a unanimous conclusion to that body
that "the most practicable and feasible
route for an isthmian canal under the
control of the management of the Unit.
ed States, is :hat known as the Nicara.
guan route." The commission esti
mates the cost of this route is $200,640,.
000. This estimate is much in excess of
any heretofore considered. The com.
mission also estimates the cost of a can
al by the Panama route at $142.342,554
according to one route, or $156,378,458
according to another route. After go.
ing over several routes, the commission
considered the dimensions of the canal
to be built.
Having in mind the increasing size of
ocean going vessels it was determined to
fix upon the depth at 35 feet at mean
low water and bottom width 150 feet
with some increase of dimensions at cer
tain points. These dimensions are larg
er than those proposed for any previous
canal scheme. While they may seem
excessive the commission points out the
canal is not likely to be opened within
10 years, during which time the increase
in maritime dimensions will likely coo 1
tinue. A width of 150 feet will allow
all but the very largest ships to pass
each other in the canal, while looks are
of dimensions to permit even the largest
ship afloat to be maneuvered. The sizej
of the looks is 740 feet in length with a
depth of 35 feet.
The senate committee on inter-oeanic
cenals held a meeting at the instance of
the chairman, Senator Morgan, to con
sider the status of the Nicaragua canal
bill.
The bill is special order in the senate
for next Monday, but there is a desire
upon the part of the Republioan mana.
gers to have it postponed for a time at
least, pending the consideration of the
subsidy shipping bill and the Hay
Panncefote treaty.
Senator Hanna, who is especially in
terested in the shipping bill, sat with
the committee presenting A views of
the Republican managers n relative
to the claims of the various measures as
to precedence in the matter of consider
ation. The committee did not reach
any definite conclusion.
DOLLIVER SWORN IN.
He Takes tl . Seat In the Senate Made
Vacant by Gear's Death.
Washington, Dec. 5.-As soon as the
senate journal had been read and ap
proved Tuesday morning Johathan Pren
tiss Dolliver, apppointed to succeed the
late Senator Gear of Iowa, took the oath
of o{Boe.
The case of Senator Olary of Montana
came up in the senate for a few moments
but went over.
At 2:05 Senator Frye moved the senate
proceed to considering the Shipping
subsidy bill. Senator Jones of Arkan
sas, demanded the roll calL The motion
carried, 38 to 20.
When the house met Mr. Hepburn of
Iowa, withdrew the credentials of J. P.*
Connor of Iowa, elected to succeed
former representative, now Senator
Dolliver, and offered new credentials
from the governor of Iowa certifying to
the election of Mr. Connor. No ob
jection was made and Mr. Connor was
sworn in.
Mr. Hull, chairman of the military
affairs committee, reported thearmy re
organisation bill and asked unanimous
consent that it be taken up tomorrow.
Mr. Sulser of New York objected.
SHIP SUBSIDY BILL.
It Will Replace the Philippine ilil Is
the Upper House.
Waihington, Dec. 5.-The Republi
ean senatorial committee on order of
business decided that the ship subsidy
bill should displace the Spooner Philip.
pines bill as the unfinished business. It
also decided that the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty should receive alternateattention
with the shipping bill. The arrangment
proves that the shipping bill shall have
preferenceb but when no one appeared to
make a speech on it the senate shall go
into ezAmtive session for the considera
lion of the treaty and will be put in
horce today.
The arrangement further provides
that if the army bill reaches the senate
prior to thedisposal of the shipping bill
w the treaty. either or both of these
may be displaced temporarily in order
to permit the prompt considemation of
that measure. The same understanding
prevails regardisig the appropriation
bills. Senator Morgan's Nicaraguan
msat bil wil probably wait upon the
laats's action on the treaty.

Washington. Dec. L-Setretary Root's

1902, together with a statement of ap
propriations for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1901. The estimates for 1901
amount to l85,903,T0l.
Democratic Cauenu.
Washington, Dec. 5. -A caucus of the
Democratic members of the house was
held in the hall of the house at the close
of the session Monday to consider the
course to be taken on army legislation.
Representative Hay of Virainia, a mem
ber of the military committee explained
the status of the army bill prepared by
Secretary Root and urged the law now
in existence be continued for two years.
No action was taken.
Protection of Galveston.
Washington, Dec. 5.-An echo of the
terrible storm at Galveston is given in a
bill by Representative Hawley of Texas
providing for a breakwater to protect
the city against the devastating storms
and calling for report from the secretary
of war relative to tihc measures of pro
tection suitable to the situation.

lation of the receipts.

WORSE THAN HAZING.
Stadeat at West Point Foreqd to Drink
a Coneesoton That Killed Sim.
New York, Dec. 5.-A special to The
Rerald from West Point says:
Authorities of the United States mil
itary academy acknowledge. that Oscar
Boos, who lies dying at his home in
Bristol, Pa., was based and cadets of
the first class admit that they forced
the young man to drink a burning liquid
at tomato catsup, worcestershire sauce
sad cayenae pepper. The young man
was called out to "the woods" where,
refusing to meet a fellow cadet in a
standup fight, he was branded a coward
Lad subsequently forced to resign from
bhe academy. The authorities have
made an investigation, and have learned
)f the episode. Colonel Mills, the super.
ntendout of the academy, declares that
Boos was only pus to the castonmary test
d mealiness. He will net discipline the
cadets involved. Colonel Mills said
"Boos was not a favorite with hia
tlasamates and was not liked by the old
adeats. He had a quarrel with a cadee
ad was 'calied out' to a personal en
sonaer. He weant outside the academy
o meet another cadet in a fair fight, but
bres the crucial moment came, I am
old, ie burst into tears. His attitude
was regarded as cowardly and unsol
lierly.
"I do not feel called upon to inquire

Women who have not known the depths of suffering think too little of the w4 \
It Is only when suffering is a prestnt reality that they come to realize that life .ithout .
living death. Many women with little menstrual irregularities imagine they .re strong and any
because they do not suffer much pain. These little irregularities are symptoms which indicate coming
suffering. It is well for you to give them immediate attention. You cannot long ignore Nature's
warning. Irregular menstruation and leucorrhaa do not bother much at first, but tern ' mplts
follow if you neglect to treat them. Falling of the womb and all those racking pains in the head
back are the penalties of carelessness and neglect.
WINE OCARDUI
will banish every trace of leucorrhaea and irregular menses. if you faithfully take It. you need not
suffer or live In dread of coming suffering. Miss Brantley found that out, when she was brought
to the fuill realization of what a blessing health is. There is no reason why you should not have the e*
same happy experience as she, if you will heed Nature's warning. All druggists sell $1.00 bottles of
Wine of Cardui.
Hazichurst, Miss., Feb. 28, 1900.
I don't know how to express the debt of gratitude I owe Wine of Cardui. If it lay within my power I
would reward you handsomely. I must tell you that I have not the least doubt in my mind that you have s'
made a perfect cure in my case at little cost. You have given me every satisfaction. Whenever I suspect
anyone of suffering from the same trouble, I shall most asuredly urge them to take Wine of Cardui.
