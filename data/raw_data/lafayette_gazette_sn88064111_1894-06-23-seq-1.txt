'Not in words,' he repeated, still loole

PREPARING FOR WAR.
The Big Gun Shop at the Navy
TYrd at Washington.
Monster Caanonl Whose Cost Is Esti
mated at One Hendred ThIousand Dol
lars Each-Methods Employed
in Their tanuaaeture.
[Special Washington Letter.1
All of the officeers of the navy are
very proud of the big gun shop which
is located at.the Washington navy
yard. During the past years fire of the
greatest cannon ever made in America
for service were completed in that big
gun foundry. They are called built
up breech-loading rifles, and are of the
very latest scientific conceptions and
mechanical patterns. They are all of
the same size, each of them being of
thirteen-inch caliber and weighing
sixty-five tons. They are forty feet
long, and each of them is capable of
throwing an armor-piercing projectile
of one thousand one hundred pounds'
weight a distance of thirteen miles.
It takes five hundred and fifty pounds'
of slow burning powder to drive one
of the projectiles th at distance and to
give the shot a muzzle velbcity of two
thousand one hubdred feet per second.
There is an old adage that in time of
peace we should prepare for war. and
after a visit to the gun foundry of the
navy yard anyone will be fully con
vinced that this country is acting upon
the wisdom of that motto.
No sooner was the work upon the
five monster cannon completed than
five more were commenced in the gun
foundry. These monsters of modern
warfare are intended for the arma
ments of the three new battleships
Indiana, Oregon and IMassachusetts.
Four are placed on each of the ba ttle
ships, two forward and two aft. so that
they can be used in action with deadly
effect, regardless of the position of the
man-of-war at the time of firing the
guns.
We all know in this country some
thing about the tremendous cost of
war, for we went through four years
of one of the most terrific struggles
the world has ever known. But the
people do not generally know in time
of peace how much it costs to prepare
for war, and only a faint idea can be
gleaned fsom. the fact of the cost of
these guns. They cost one hundred
thousand dollars each. When all of
them have been completed, the total
cost will have been $1.200,000. When
we take into consideration the fact
that smaller guns are being made all
the time. and that the navy must be
supplied with costly battles'hips before
these guns can be placed upon them,
the cost of preparing for war in time
of peace may be partly realized. It
will cost seven hundred dollars every
time one of these immense guns is fired
in action. The cost will be five hun
dred dollars for the nickel steel pro
jectile, and two hundred dollars for the
powder.
The work upon these guns was com
rnenced a 1Tttle over two years ago, and
they were completed in a little more:
than ten weeks; that is, except the
breech mechanism and the mounts,
which required a couple of months
longer. Heretofore the navy yard gun
foundry has turned out in considerable
numbers, four, five. six and eight-inch
rifle guns, and a few ten and twelve
inoh rifles. But these thirteen-inch
giants of destruction are the largest
ever attempted in this country. They
are regarded as the perfection of ex
periment, study and research, al
though their fabrication is by very in
teresting processes, which are com
paratively simple.
The forgings of all these guns have
been purchased at great cost, either
at the works of the Bethlehem Iron
company of Pennsylvania. or the 'Mid
ville Steel company at Nicetown, near
Philadelphia. These forgings are the
result of mechanical and mathematical
skill in the application of a long and
difficult art to the raw material. The
forgings for each gun cost 685,000, the
manufacture of the gun proper. $10.
D00, and the construction of the mount,
388,000. Under the act of congress
making appropriation for these guns,
congress insisted by a special pro
vision of.the law, which has been reit
crated every year since the commence
ment of the new navy, that the ores
td substances and elements which go
ikto the maling of American war
sltp and their armamelts shal be of
Americanh production and manufao
ture. Therefore in the creation of a
gun forgine, it is necessary that it
must be of the best steel in America,
comliounded exclusively of American
materials. This forging must be of
the finest open-hearth gun steel and
the casting nmust weigh about double
what the forging that is to be made
from it will weigh. If there are any
bubbles, or any flaws or rifts what.
ever, in the steel it will be rejected by
the gun foundry and turned back to
the producer of it. The forging is
made into a shape approximating that
of the finished gun, so that it is all
ready for manufacture when it reaches
the gun foundry.
Of all of the processes which are gone
through with at the navy yard gun
foundry in the manufacture of a large
canuon._the preparation and placing of
a .jacket is the most interesting. The
jacket is a large cylinder placed over
the original tube at the rear, and comn
passing the powder chamber to give it
greater resistant strength. The
jacket forging is bored up from the in
side to a diameter slightly less than
The exterior diameter of the tube
which it is to encircle. The jacket is
then expanded by heat in a hot air fur
nace, and, lifted carefully by means of
a crane, is placed directly above the
original tube which is perpendicular
and securely held with the breech up*
ward.. The jacket is not only heated
to a white heat, but to an almost Im
perceptible dull red. It is allowed to
descend from the crane acourately and
to slip down over the breech end of
the tube, the expansion of the heated
metal of the jacket making this move
ment possible, notwithstanding the
fact that the inner diameter of the jack
et is somewhat less 'than the outside
diameter of the tube when the jacket is
cool. This process of putting on the
jacket is one of the most remarkable
pieces of skilled work that can be done
with machinery. When the jacket is
finally lowered into its place over the
rear of the original tube, the jacket
fits tightly over the tube and com
presses it as it becomes cool. By this
operation the tube and jacket are prao
tiically combined into one piece.
There are four hoops also bored out
to a diameter slightly less than the re
spective portions of the gun which
they are intended to encircle, and one
after another they are put in place by
the same process as that used in jack.
eting, the metal cooling and contract
ing. and compressing the inner layers
firmly in its embrace. The great can
non is thus thoroughly reinforced and
then the work of rifling and finishing
begins. The fi-st thing to be done
when all the jackets and hoops are on
is to take the gun from its upright
position, put it on a lathe and have it
turned down over its whole inside to
the finished dimensions necessary to
its completion. When you remember
that each one of these guns weighs
sixty-five tons, you will realize that
the mechanism in the gun foundry
which picks up and lays down and
moves around these immense bodies of
steel must le an approximation of per
fection. This work is only rendered
possible by reason of the fact that the
gun foundry contains eight prodigious
gun lathes of unique design and un
limited power; and that the lifting
power of the crane is limited only by
the horse-power of the steam engines.
One of the immense lathes in the gun
foundry has a capacity for boring guns
fifty-one feet in length and of turning
tubes of fifty-seven feet, and conse
quently could bore guns of sixteen
inch caliber.
It is interesting to see one of the
great cranes traveling from one end of
the big shop to the other, noiselessly,
smoothly. stretching from one side of
the ceiling to the other, its little
wheels well oiled and not a sound to
be heard save when the clanking
chains are let down to encircle some
heavy object. The man who stands in
the crane. and is its engineer and di
rector. is so high in the air that he
looks like a mere boy. While it may
be true that the hundreds of men be
low who are rifling. polishing, finish.
ing and perfecting the great gun may
be more scientific, and their work may
be more important, nevertheless, when
you visit the big foundry, you will
carry away with you a more distinct
memory of the man in the oreno than
pf all the 91ite4 wnaders of the place.

GOLD PRODUCTION.
The World's Supply of the Precious Met
al for Colnage.
Production of Igold and silver has al
ways had a remarkable influence on
the trade and prices of the commercial
world. Except in remote ages or in
partly-civilized countries, these two
metals have bden the source of money.
Even the coin in existence at any one
time was continually disappearing.
It was lost from the pocket, melted
up into plate, or exported to the dense
ly-populated regions of Asia, or the
whole stock was diminished by the
minute wear and tear on each coin.
The opening of new mines has there
fore always had striking Influences,
through its effect on the total money
supply.
It was from Africa that the largest
supplies of gold came in the early days
of civilization: and the greatly in
creased production of gold in Africa is
now exciting attention and interest
among all the students of the mone
tary question.
For many centuries after the fall of
the Roman empire gold production, as
well as that of silver, ceased almost en
tirely. Then came the discovery of
America, and of the enormous hoards
of precious metals in the cities of Mex
ico and Peru.
It was in those days that the "treas
ure ships," bound for the European
coast, fell a constant prey to the roving
English war-vessels of Queen Elizabeth.
and to the still more famous and dan
gerous "buccaneers" of the Spanish
main.
At last, in 1847, well in season for the
revival of the world's commercial in
dustry, came the discovery of the great
California gold mines. Those of Aus
tralia were discovered about four years
later, and the annual gold production
rose at once to a total the largest in
the world's history.
Even now, in our days of improved
and scientific mining, the world's year
ly yield of gold, in the exhaustion of
the richest western mines, is scarcely
two-thirds of the vast yearly produc
tion of the "fifties."
At the very time when the gold pro
duction of the world at large was
showing signs of decrease, another and
very remarkable area for gold mining
was discovered. Twenty-six years ago,
some explorers in South Africa discov
ered gold in what is now the Transvaal
or South African republic. lIardly
enough was found to pay prospectors
for their labor, and for eighteen or
twenty years the gold production of
South Africa remained almnost a cipher.
Then between 1885 and 188 njew dis
coveries of far richer mines were made
in the same region. Companies were
formed at once in London and other
money centers to work the mines; im
migrants flocked to the new district to
make their fortune, as they did to
California in 1849 and to Australia in
1853.
The results were most remarkable.
Africa's gold production in lST7 was
valued at less than three-quarters of a
million dollars. The next year five
millions' worth was taken out. In
1890 the product was ten millions, and
last year South Africa contributed to
the world's stock of gold no less th an
thirty-three millions-as much as the
United States had produced in the
preceding year, and an amount ex
ceeded in 1893 only by this country and
by Australia.
It is not supposed that the full ca
pacity of South Africa's gold mines has
yet been developed. There may be dis
covered other gold-fields in districts as
yet unvisited by explorers.
This possibility played its part in the
African "partition treaties" of the Eu
ropean states in 1890. It has influenced
still more powerfully the recent,
Matabele war, undertaken chiefly for
the purpose of protecting the pioneer
miners and settlers of a British com
mercial company from the raids of
savages.
Nor are there lacking signs that this
year's gold production in other nations
will be larger. The great fall in the
price of silver, measured by gold,
which has forced many silver mines in
this country to shut down, has turned
the attention of miners to long-desert
ed gold fields. The result has been
seen already in a considerable increase
of our own gold production of 1893.

FROM NATURE'S MODEL.
Suceessful Inventors Follow the Hlints
That Nature Gives.
If you will carefully study almost
every invention, even the very simple
ones, which you can readily under
stand, you will discover that in nearly
every case they are only the duplica
tions of something that nature herself
invented long ages ago.
Nature herself seems to be inexhaus
tible in resources. Whenever she
needs a thing, when it is necessary for
the preservation or comfort of an en
tire race, then she looks about and in
vents it withoat any more fuss.
The axle of the bicycle is an exact
duplication of the joint of a frog's
leg. The honey bee by her cells has
taught men how the greatest amount
of strength and space can be
brought together. The lighthouse
was never a success until it was built
in the form of the trunk of a tree.
There are in nature ten thousand
secrets which have never been wrested
from her. The spider has evidently
used her wed as a telephone line ever
since the world began. There ought
to be a class in school for studying na
ture, not superficially, merely as a
scientific study, but as a practical les
son. Take an animal or an insect that
does a certain thing, which man him

A BADGERED WITNESS.
She Was Troubled at First. But Iliafly
Told Her Story.
"Your honor, I have a witness in the
next, room who is able and ready to
prove an alibi for this man," said the
attorney for the defense eagerly.
"Very well, bring him in," com
manded the judge.
"It's a woman, your honor."
"WVell, well, bring her in."
"But, your honor, I can not have the
counsel for the prosecution badger my
witness. She is a very respectable per
son, and has never been in a court of
justice before."
"B'ring her in."
The woman was brought in, and duly
sworn, and told to relate what she
knew, and to remember that she was
under oath. She was short and red
faced, and began volubly.
"You see, jedge, it was this way, I
aed to my darter, sez I-"
"Stop, stop. You are only to make
a plain statement. Where was the
prisoner when you first saw him?"
"That's what I was getting at. I

"Never mind what you said to your
daughter. WVhat day of the month
was it that you last saw the man now

"I guess I ought ter know. It was
the day our folks went to county

"But what day of the month, and
what day of the week way that?"
"Same day I made Almy's new sage

"Woman," exclaimed the counsel for
the prosecution, "you evidently don't

SOON FORGOTTEN.
A Sad Conmennt Upon the Death of
Napoleon Ilonaparte.
The vanity of human enddavor, when
it is directed toward the attainment of
selfish ends, was never better illus
trated than by the manner in which
the news of the death of Napoleon
Blonaparte at St. Helena was received
in Paris. Napoleon had been the mas
ter of Europe; he had reached the
height of human glory, and in France.
and particularly in Paris, all things
had centered around his name.
Quite recently the memoirs of Louis
Aime Martin, a French man-of letters
of the early part of the present cen
tury, and an acute observer of men and
affairs in his time, have been published
in Paris for the first time. In them,
under date of July 6, 1821, occurs anote
which shows what the name of the
"Emperor Napoleon" had become at.
that time.
"lonaparte is dead." says Martin,
"and the news is repeated coldly and
forgotten, and people go on to talk of
other things. I wished particularly to
know what effect this news Would
have upon the people. I passed the
Palais-Royal. A public crier called
'Here's your account of the death of
Bonaparte!'
"This cry, which it seemed must
have appalled Europe, was without ef
fect; no one listened. There was not a
purchaser of the man's wares; every
one was indifferent.
"I entered several cafes, and found
the same indifference-Coldness every
where. no one's intelligence was
touched. I can not answer for the
hearts, but this man had inspired
more of astonishment than of love.
"In one cafe I heard people talking
about his death, and then they went
on to talk about the censorship law,
which is discussed so much to-day, and
which will be forgotten to-morrow.
And this is glory"--Youth's Com
