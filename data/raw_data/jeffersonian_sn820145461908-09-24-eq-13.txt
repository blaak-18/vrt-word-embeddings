Os this book Mr. Watson says: “In
order that editors, speakers, lecturers,
and voters might have in the conven
ient storehouse of one volume all the
scattered information now contained
in many; and in order that they might
have a brief statement of the line of
argument which we adopt upon all es
sential issues, I have written this book.
I have endeavored to fill it to the brim,
with facts, important facts, undisputed
facts. I have tried to make it an ar
mory from which reformers can draw
every weapon of offense and defense.”

Letters From The People
-September 13, 1908.
From a Friend:
I firmly believe that you will poll
the largest vote you ever have in
this country. I have never seen so
maiM political flies trying to crawl
into the syrup-pitcher as there are
at this time; all claiming Mr. Wat
son’s planks as their platform. If
Mr. Matson s platform is such a good
thing, why do they not have the man
hood to come over to you and say,
find we are going to join hands with
Ton are right; we agree with you,
you’? Why do they not help the man
who has struggled hard for fifteen
years to put into force the much
needed legislation?”
September 14, 1908.
R- R. Chartain, Ochlochnee, Ga.:
“Must tell you something. The
Heart crowd-—Hisgen, Shearn, Pol
lock and John Temple Graves—-made
some fine Populist speeches in Thom
asville last Saturday. They won us
many votes by hammering away at
the necessity for breaking up the old
party lines. Many people are willing
and anxious to jump the line, but are
waiting for something new to pop up
and give ’em nerve. In brief, the
boys crippled hundreds of ’em Sat
urday, many of whom we fellows here
will catch. If you will get in behind
that crowd you will catch the bal
ance.”
ANTIQUATED BANKING LAWS.
•
That part of the national banking
law that compels the people to pay
interest on their circulating money
is an antiquated war measure and
ought to be repealed.
Currency issued direct by the gov
ernment is a legal tender and draws
no interest; national bank currency
draws interest from the people and is
not a legal tender.
The government is security for all
national bank currency in circulation,
but all United States notes, whenever
issued, are a direct obligation of the
government.
To say that national bank curren
cy is better money than that issued
direct by the government is to say
that man’s endorsement on a note
for a friend makes him more respon
sible than he would be on a note
issued direct by himself.
If you were compelled to sne a man
for an*, obligation would you not
rather sue a man on a note issued
direct by himself than to sue him
as an endorser for some one else?
All the twaddle resorted to by
financial manipulators that national
bank or asset currency secured by
government, State, county, municipal,
railroad bonds or other securities, is
better than currency issued direct
by the government is mere subterfuge
to confuse the masses of the people
and blind them to their own interests.
We are now paying over fifteen
million dollars per year interest on
bonds to secure our present national
bank note circulation. The system
isn’t worth the cost.
The interest we pay on bonds to
secure national bank note or asset
Ueffersoniatt
currency circulation is a small evil
when compared with the power this
system gives the manipulators to con
trol the volume of our circulating
money.
Loaning government money to na
tional banks ■without interest is an
ol her evil and virtually amounted to
a present of several million dollars
per year to the national banks.
Ex-secretary 'Gage, in the “North
American Review,” last winter stated
that at two per cent, the government
would have received over seventy
millions of dollars in interest on
money loaned to national banks up
to the present time.
It takes some people a long time
to overcome partisan prejudice enough
to see an evil. But "when they do
get their eyes open they begin to
realize their own stupidity.
Republican manipulators created
the evils of the present banking sys
tem in violation to the injunction
left by Lincoln and other honest
leaders. But Bryan, after howling
against the evils of the system for
over ten years, now proposes a guar
antee deposit plan that would prac
tically perpetuate the entire system
with all its evils.
JAMES CONZETT.
THE BONDS AND GREENBACKS.
In reply to a correspondent in last
week’s News, Mr. Clymer says:
“They never had to issue bonds to
get the money to pay the war debt.
The wealth of this nation guaranteed
the payment of the bonds, also of the
greenbacks, so if the government had
issued the money there would have
been no interest to pay. But the
bonds were issued, so the money
sharks could buy the bonds less than
face value,, then get gold interest on
same. Then buy the greenbacks, $2
or $2.40 for every dollar, then buy
bonds, thus keeping a chain of un
righteous gain always in their favor.
‘ ‘ The soldiers had to take the green
backs, but the bondholders did not
have to take greenbacks—they had
gold. One money for the bondholder,
another for the gun and plow-holder.
“I am a gun-holder over 70. I want,
to live a religious life, but it is hard
to do this when I think how they
wronged us who bore the brunt of
that dark struggle.
‘ ‘ May God bless every effort for re
form. The first issue of greenbacks
was good, but upon the second issue
they put the exception clause. Soon
as that was done every dollar of gold
was worth two dollars sometimes
more—this was the exception. ‘This
note was good for all debts both pub
lic and private except the duties on
improvements and interest on public
debt.’ “ —Joliet News.
