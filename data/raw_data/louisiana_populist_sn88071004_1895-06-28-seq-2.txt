we will publish shorily. The club
now numbers over 60.-Battle Flag.
It is reportcdl that Secretary of
the Treasury Carlisle declines to
meet Hon. W. J. Bryan in joint
debate on the financial question be
cause he is a Populist. Is it a
crime to he a Populist ? Is a Pop
ulist outlawed by the code of Mr.
Carlisle i If quoted right, Mr.
Carlisle has assumed the position of
the man who declined the challenge
to fight because, having no better
reason for avoiding a contest, at
tempted to excuse himself on the
plea that his challenger was no
gentleman, although in all respects
both were of equal social standing
and one as much a gentleman as
the other. Face to face with Mr.
Bryan, the secretary of the treasn
ry could not sustain himself or his
gold standard theories in joint de
bate before an intelligent audience
of American citizens not allied or
in sympathy with the money pow

The Battle Fag at Rolbeline. La..
rather severely criticises the Mem
\his silver convention for being
run by "a gang of office-holders
and stalwart democrats" who pro
pose to make the fight for silver
entirely inside the Democratic par
rv.
The Battle Flag is right. but
should have given more of its space
to - howinr swhy sulch a tight would
I c a f.iliire from start to finish,
instead of using all his space tell
ing how many po)pulists could, and
could not he fooled by silver as a
side issue, to get them hack into
the democratic party.
M We agree with Bro. Tetts mmost
heartily that the People's party is
or too large, too well edClucate(, and
too well organized to be side-track
ed into either one of the old par
ties by silver or any other one
' plank in its platform; but because
somle office-seeking democrats de
sire this and are working for that
wI end, is not sufficient cause to check
in
this great non-partisan educational
movement for free silver andl more
-money, that is broader and more
powerful than any party.
We believe with Bro. Tetts that
the only earnest and unmistakable
eh evidence which the New Orleans
h convention gave of its fidelity to
r. silver and its purity of motive in
the support of the same, was its
o declaration to support the cause
wt without regard to party lines.
When we reflect that for 20 years
SIboth the old parties have never let
an opportunity pass without de
r. preciating silver all it was in their
I power to do-the Republican party
^e taking the initiative and the I)emo
r cratic party completing the job
under Cleveland-we can see that
o supporting silver only to party
s lines is in old parties, very little, if
g any support at all.
We understand a political party
to be only a means toward an end
-is-an organized effort to secure the
- enactment of certain principles,
e and every one will admit that the
r man who considers the means
ereater than the end sought, or
the party greater than the princi
r plea it advocates, is a fool for want
i of sense. Yet the man who would
support silver or any other prmn
ciple he advocates only so far as
. he couM do so and remain in pres
o ent party liUes, is just such a fool,
or is a cunning enemy to silver or
whatever principle he advocates in
a that way.
e But the movement which is edu
cating the' people on the silver
questionis progressive, and because
the great convention at Memphis
did not prove as loyal to silver as
it might have done, is no reason
that it did not set in motion migh
Sty educational forces which will
Beventually bring the majority of
the people up to that peint long
since reached by Bro. Tette anad
Sourslf, where they will make any
reasmonable sacrifice for the princi
Spies they advocate.
SWe believe the New Orleans
Sconveation is much nearer the true
mlines upon which the silver cam
-paign will be snuceessfully conduct
Sed, but we believe that of Mem
phis has set the ball to rolling, and
that it will get in good shape as it
rolUl
And we also agree with the Bat
tle Flag tint no populist will be
found so foolish as to leave a true
Iand unflinching free silver party
and go into esther one of the old
parties to make a fiht for silver.

I anm asked to explain the advant
age of the free coinage of silver
- st the ratio of 16 to 1, or any other
ratio, to the wage working class, a
i if any such benefits do accrire.
There would be a temporary gain ,
to the working classes .by the free h
coinage of silver, inasmuch as
many people depending upon its n
production would be employed,
though directly a very small pro
portion of our population. While a
the silver mine owners would re
ceive the principal benefits, the t
money oligarchy of the world must
necessarily give up the possession p
of much property that they now
hold in order to get and maintain
the ownership of this new addition
to the currency, for a practical,
complete monopoly of currency is
necemary to mamntain a money oli
garchy. This would perhaps re
quire several years to acomplish,
but during those years in the shift- N
ine of property for money and
money for property, there would
be a stimulus for labor, and in
that way, it would get a greater
share than it is getting to-day with
out the money. The history of
Europe shows that wherever gov- o0
eraments have coined new money It
or printed money, the latter al- ce

Sankruptly hun dreds of thousands
of merchanuts and nmortgaged home
owners. would l satisfy the ipople
with their condition and thus pre
vent the ultimate result of a cor
rect system. I amln one of those
who believe that the staie of edu

of society or socialisnm has l)'en"
- developed to such an extent that
it is not going backwards, and that

these lpro lelcs tllrini the 1 srit, I
of ,repression, would simply have
anti uºe more money in their pro
pagation. Men in want atre moe
ready to listen to what is termed
'calamity howlers," and there will
be plenty of want and plenty of
howlers, whether we have free
silver or not. Edu(cation is going
forward and the co-operative com
monwealth in which the govern
ment will not only issue all money
for value received, but will also
guarantee employment to all peo
ple who wish it, is coming rapidly.
There never can he e quitable
money other than that which is
paid out for wealth created, so
when a man shall have prodiwed
$100 of wealth, he parts with the
wealth for a certificate of $1041
called money, which passes into
circulation. So long as that mon
ey was in circulation it is evidence
that wealth is stored somewhere to
redeem it, and when the wealth
shall have passed out uof collective
ownership, is stored in the hands
of the consumer, the $10o certifi
cate or money passes out of circu
lation into the hands of the collec
tive ownership or government and
is no loner a diesturbing factor in
increasing or decreasing the value
of money. In this way the larger
units of any nation would me eter
nally of the same purchasing pow
er.
Under the present system if there
is a million dollars of property
stored and only $50N ,y to of money,
then it stands to roason that if
wealth is represented by money
that each dollar has to its credit $2
worth of products, but if only $1
worth of products is given for a
dollar then there is $500,00) worth
of prodects for which there is no
medium of exchange and toput it
on the market incurs debt. Under
the co-operative commonwealth
debt, as at present understood,
would be impossible. There would
be no occasion or incentive for
debt and the laws for collection of
debt would thus fall into disuse.
Referring back to the free coinage
of silver, I think it a most excel
lent thing to get people, who oth
erwisee take no interest in political
questions, to study this phase of
the money problem. It is not a
solution but a palliative, but eve
ry investigator of truth must have
some starting point, and I am sat
isfied that more people have start
ed to learn something about the
money problem from the discus
sion of this silver question and
have gone on to learn the truth
about money and government, than
from any other means. I, there
fore, favor the free coinage of sil
ver as a means of interesting peo
ple in the ethics of political econo
