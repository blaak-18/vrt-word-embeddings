THAT BULLION STEAL.
Two Arrests Made sad Others Shadowed
by the Detectivee.
San Francisco, Aug. 10.-The police
are convinced that John Winters, or
"Back" Taylor, as he is known, who is
now in custody, is the man who planned
and executed the robbery of the Selby
smelter at Vallejo. Some think he had
no acoomplices in the job. The stolen
bullion is thought to be buried near
Winter's cabin, not far from the smelt
ing works, or sunk in the shallow water
of the bay near by.
Winters, who had been an employe of
the Smelting company, was missed soon
after the robbery and on the door of his
cabin was found a notice which read:
"Any one who enters here will be shot."
A dark colored cloth was drawn over
the window so the interior could not be
seen. Detectives watched the cabin all
Tuesday night, but Winters did not re
turn.
Wednesday morning they 'broke into
the house and found many articles tend
ing to connect him with' the crime.
These included a small incandescent
lamp and battery, crusted with mad
similar to the earth in the tunnel, and
many things similar to articles found in
the excavation under the wall of the
Smelting works.
Winters is a native of Prussia, 37
years old, and has no relatives in this
country. He is a man of some educa
tion and reading, but from the day he
landed in America has led a roving
life, seldom saying more than a few
months in any city. On the plains of
Texas he was a vaquero, breaking wild
bronohos for a monthly pittance; in I.o
Angeles he was a contractor; in Dallas
a conductor; in Memphis a car driver;
in Ohioo, Cali., a rancher. There is
scarcely a business which he has not
attempted. Since his arrival in Crooket
seven years ago he has lived a hermit's
life.
The fact that a cap said to belong to
him was found in the tunnel is consid
ered one of the most damaging bits of
evidence of against him. Winters says
he bought the electric battery two years
ago, but marks on it indicate it was
sold within a month.
The bulllion stolen amounts to over
$280,000 and a reward of $25,000 has
been offered for its return.
Several other men are under suspicion
and one named Peter Larsen has been
arrested at Vallejo. Another man un
der suspicion is said to have called at
the express oidce at Crocket for a pack
ake addressed to Winters. Still another
man upon whom detectives have their
eyes, is said to have recently carry l
pac~kages to Winter-i rub ti 1'"t".1 tha

SPOILED CHILDREN. .
Care Them by Teaehias Them Mu

A summer hotel I a good place to
study children's dispositions. The little
troop which races around the plesas
and plays hide and seek on the lawn
has all the characteristics of a circle of
grown ups. You see the miniature cou
celted man, the tiny woman back biter
and the embryo filirts of the next dec
ade; but, above all, you are painfully
aware of the prevalence of spoiled chil
dren.
For instance, the lunch bell rings.
Bobby, aged 4, dashes up to his mother
and tries to pull her away from a womn
an friend with whom she is talking.
"Mamma!" he cries sharply "Mam
ma, come; I want to eat!" No answer.
"Mamma, 'mamoma, m-a-amma-a-naa

around and in a mild manner remarks,
"Bobby, be still."
But Bobby won't be stilL He tug,
pulls, pushes and squirms until finally,
his mother is glad to get up and fol

"What a horrid temper that child
has!" a woman remarks, and another
who is wiser an

Whiiih was only too true.
