SUPERIOR, WIS. —John M. of
Indianapolis, Ind., an organizer
for the Ku Klux Klan. was or
dered to leave Bayfield and stay
out by leading citizens of the
Chequamegon Bay city, following
a secret meeting at a church
there in which the Indianapolis
man attempted to organize a
branch of the Klan, according to
a special story received by The
Superior Telegram.
The story stated that M had
left the city, declaring he was go
ing “to organize Superior” and
other towns in the northern part
of the state.

crations. But the riff-raff of such
communities wake up a little later
and find that a well-organized Klan
exists among them. Wherever the
Klan finds opposition, organization
work progresses rapidly. In every
community there are a number of
citizens who are anxiously waiting to
join the Klan. An organizer calls up
on them, and soon a local Klan is in
stituted. But when the organizer
meets with opposition then his work
is lightened greatly. When a certain
element in any community shows that
it fears the Klan, and does every
thing in its power to stop its organiz
ing, the organizer finds that his cir
cle of prospective members is imme
diately widened. Instead of having
only those as prospects who want to
join, he finds additional support from
those who resent the tactics and
question the motives of the opposi
tion.
Now as to this Bayfield case, John
M. of Indianapolis, Klan organizer,
is directed to organize in the city of
Bayfield. He Is clothed with full le
gal authority. Ills mission Is en
tirely lawful. He calls a meeting in
a local Protestant church. He ex
plains to the American citizens there
assembled the great American prin
ciples of the Ku Klux Klan. Un
doubtedly the majority of the audi
ence are decided to join the Klan—
to join the ranks of their millions
of brothers throughout the nation.
But wait, a black sheep has wandered
o’er the threshold.
Klansman M. has completed his ad
dress. Up jumps one L. E. McKenzie,
former newspaper man and now gen
eral manager or something of the
Apostle Islands Indian Pageant cor
poration, said corporation, it is al
leged, being solely a propaganda
scheme. Hard-boiled Mac, there and
then, and then and there, attacked
the methods of the Klan and declared
that should a Klan organization be
formed in Bayfield, he would conduct
a wide-open fight on the Klan on be
half of the Indian Pageant corpora
tion, and would not only make public
all of the proceedings of all of its
meetings, but would cause to be pub
lished the names of any and all citi
zens affiliating with the organiza
tion. That earns for him. we be
lieve. the sobriquet of “The Pat
O'Donnell of Wisconsin.”
According to the Ashland Press,
old Mighty Mac relieved his peeve
with the following harangue: “Wheth
er rightly or wrongly accused of mob
violence and extra-legal procedure,
the unsavory reputation of the Klan
is such as to make it an unfit instru
ment for any reform that might be
inaugurated in Bayfield.” So Mac be
lieves that the Klan bears an unsa
vory reputation. It is a well-known
fact that Christ is the Klansman’s
criterion of character. The founder
of Christianity was persecuted. But
Christianity is the strongest force
for good in the world today. • The
Klan has been persecuted. But Klan
kraft is growing to be a mighty force
for good throughout America. Per
secution in Bayfield is bound to make
the Bayfield Klan grow. Then Mac
declared further: “This organizer at
tacks the so-called ‘hunkies,’ yet In
the city of Milwaukee, four-fifths of
the Klan organization is made of
these people.” We can see that this
assertion will cause thousands of
Milwaukee Klansmen to suffer from
split sides.
Southeastern Europe, where the
“hunkies” come from, has about as
much reperesentation in the Klan as
have Protestants in the court of
Spain. Milwaukee Klansmen, native
born Americans all, are descended
from the great peoples of northern
Europe, where liberty and enlighten
ment flashed its truths over the con
tinent, severing the shackles of super
stition and mental bondage. Milwau
kee Klansmen, as Klansmen every
where, are descendants of those free
men who followed the great Martin
Luther, of those valiant warriors who
served under Gustavus Adolphus, of
Sweden, who smashed the armies of
“hunkies” under Count Tilly and Wal
lenstein, of those fighters who threw
the Duke of Alva, inquisitor-general,
out of the Netherlands, and served
under the Prince of Orange when he
defeated the Irish at the battle of
the Boyne. Milwaukee Klansmen, as
Klansmen everywhere, are descend
ants of the Vikings who discovered
our shores, of the Pilgrims who
founded America, of the French Hu
guenots who settled in the Carolinas,
coming here to escape the hate of
inquisitorial decrees, of the Orange
men who defend liberty and defy
tyrany without fear, of the revolu
tionary fathers who freed the colo
nies from tyrannical rule, and 6f the
sterling men and women who mi
grated to our shores in the fifties and
sixties and helped to build America.
Milwaukee Klansmen are descend
ants of the Protestant peoples of
Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany,
England, Holland, Scotland, and
North Ireland. If these, L. E. Mc-
Kenzie, can he termed as "hunkies."
then the word “hunkies” as today in
terpreted, is a misinterpretation in
deed.
But to continue with Mac’s oration.
He continued: "Admitting that Bay
field and other cities need cleaning

up. affiliation with the Klan would
bring about religious and other dis
sensions that would be worse than
the evils from which we may now be
suffering. You tell us that your or
ganization is not anti-Catholic, and
you are dealing with only half the
truth. You think you have a secret
meeting. Fifty per cent wf Bayfield
knows of this meeting and who are
attending it, and I’ll take personal
responsibility for seeing that the oth
er 50 per cent knows all about it
before 6 o’clock tomorrow evening.
We are presenting a major project
here this year, one that deals with
the early work of Catholic mission
aries in these islands. We are in no
sense a Catholic organization, but
one of leading citizens of northern
Wisconsin. But more than 50 per
cent ef the citizens of Bayfield are
of Catholic faith, and we do not pro
pose to have any secret society with
an unsavory reputation bring about
dissensions that would be disastrous
to a civic program that affects all of
the middle west. If you organize
here. I’ll conduct a wide-open fight
against the Klan that will bring out
a great many facts you are not tell
ing in your organization meetings.”
Verily, this fellow Mac reminds us
of the weasel who sought to destroy
the mountain. The weasel steod at
the mountain’s base and said: “Moun
tain, I am going to put you out of
business.” Then Mr. Weasel began
gnawing at the mountain’s base. He
gnawed, and gnawed, and gnawed,
and after a while he had a hole of
several feet in diameter in the moun
tain’s base. He ceased in his labors
and looked at the mountain. He then
said: “Mountain, your end is at hand.”
Then he gnawed, and gnawed, and
gnawed, and the hole became bigger
in the mountain’s base. But as he
gnawed and gnawed a rock above was
loosened. The weasel again ceased
his labors. He viewed the gigantic
mountain. “Mountain, you are not
going to last much longer.” Then he
gnawed, and gnawed, and —“plop,” the
loosened rock flattened Mr. Weasel
like a pancake.
In submitting this story, it is not
our purpose to infer that a rock will
flop on Mac’s head. Our sole pur
pose is to show that Mac’s “chal
lenge” to the millions of native-born
white, Protestant Gentile American
citizens, is so ridiculous that we
laugh out loud. Mac’s challenging
the Klan is parallelable to the weasel
threatening to annihilate the moun
tain. Mac should profit hj the deb*
acles staged by Walton of Oklahoma,
Parker of Louisiana, and O’Donnell
of Chicago.
He Fears and Fears
Mac admits that Bayfield needs
cleaning up, but he seems to fear
that if the Klan organizes there, that
this may be accomplished. He also
fears that the Klan will bring about
religious and other dissensions. But
it seems that this dissension already
exists. And the Roman Catholics,
with Mac as their captain, are the
dissensionists. They have their own
secret societies to which Protestants
cannot belong. Why, then, should
not the Protestants of Bayfield have
an organization to which Catholics
cannot belong? “Oh, no!” says Mac.
"Protestants shall not organize. That
would bring on dissension.” But
when the opposition organize, that
does not cause dissension, not at all.
Such logic is like warmed-up Mac says,
although not in the same words, that
Protestants shall not organize in Bay
field, because more than 60 per cent
of Bayfield’s population is Roman
Catholic.
There are hundreds of communi
ties in Wisconsin where 50 per cent
of the population is Protestant, yet
no one cared a continental if the
Catholics organized. If the Klan is
not to organize in Bayfield because
more than 60 per cent of the popula
tion is against it, then along the
same line of logic every Catholic so
ciety in communities where the Prot
estants are in the majority should
disband forthwith.
Then Mac vociferates further that
if the Klan is organized in Bayfield
the pageant and the corporation
swinging the thing will suffer. Just
why and how we do not know, as Mac
failed to explain. Does he fear that
the Bayfield Klansmen would be so
devoid of honor as to wreck a “civic
program that affects all of the mid
dle west?” They wouldn’t do that,
Brother McKenzie. Just to prove
that, we submit a proposition. We
hear that the Klans of Wisconsin are
planning on a great outdoor Klonvo
cation this coming summer, which
will be attended by several hundred
thousand. Why not extend an invi
tation to the Klan to hold this great
gathering in the city of Bayfield dur
ing the time of the pageant? Think
this over.
But to continue, The Ashland
Press, of Ashland, Wis., carried a
litttle squib in its columns the day
after Mac delivered his oration,
which read thusly:
“The Indian Pageant has already
yielded returns to the Chequamegon
Bay region in the person of ’Mac’
McKenzie. manager of the pageant,
who rid Bayfield of the presence of
Ku Klux Klan organizers who were
attempting to start a little Klan all
their own in our neighborhood.
"Ashland is also promised a visit by
John M., of Indianapolis, a minor
representative of the ’Grand Mogul.’
Watch your washing, Dear Readers,
or you may see your favorite white
sheet parading down the street soon
with K. K. K. in large characters all
over its shining surface."
Well, many a truth is spoken in
jest. And when the favorite white
sheets do parade the streets of Ash
land, we’ll bet that the insignificant
editor will moan, “Lawd a Massy,
de Klux am in town."
We are not kidding. In many
towns in Wisconsin, local editors
■lammed and ridiculed the Klan with
the regularity of a chicken going to
roost. Then when the Klan organis

Ticket Scalpers Busy
At Minneapolis Show
MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., March 10.
- There is hardly a sport that is on
a commercial basis which has not felt
the money-grabbing talons of the
ticket scalpers. And in the last few
years these parasites have seriously
injured college athletic activities by
fleecing as many people as possible.
Although much has been said in de
nunciation of the practices of the
ticket scalpers, very little has been
actually done to curb their sales.
Sometimes we can’t help but think
that inside men work hand-in-hand
with the scalpers.
The National Observer, a Masonic
paper of Minneapolis, in the Febru
ary 23 issue, comes to the front with
an article which is worthy of atten
tion. We quote the National Observ
er as follows:
“While an eastern boxing commis
sion, and possibly the federal author
ities, is trying to find out whether a
certain fight promoter was in col-
Brothers Discover
They All Belong
To Ku Klux Klan
GREENVILLE, S. C„ March I—The
seven sons of an honored citizen of
a neighboring county gathered at the
old homestead a few days ago to
celebrate their father’s birthday and
to have a family reunion. The seven
sons had not been together in more
than a dozen years. Each one lives
in a different state. During their
conversation it was developed that
all save one are members of the Ku
Klux Klan, and the unnaturalized
one declared that he would make ap
plication for membership as soon as
he got back home. The father said
that owing to the infirmities of ad
vancing years he might never join
but that he was in full sympathy
with the organization.
One of these sons lives in Ohio
and is a railroad official; another
lives in New York and is in the in
surance business; another lives in
Virginia and is a merchant; one lives
in Georgia and is a farmer; one is
a government official and is station
ed in the far west; one lives in Louis
iana and is a minister, while the sev
enth is a county official in South
Carolina. None of the brothers
knew, until they met the other day,
tJhat any of the others were inter
ested in the Klan and its work. The
case is regarded as a most unusual
one and has caused a good deal of
comment, and is probably without a
parallel in the country.
Three Crosses Burn in
Elk Garden, W. Va.
ELK GARDEN, W. VA.. March 10
Like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky,
three fiery crosses blazed forth simul
taneously on a trinity of hills sur
rounding this town a recent evening.
The appearance of the blazing em
blems was preceded by heavy bomb
ing. It is understood that when a
cross is burned it is significant that
a Klan has been organized in the
particular neighborhood in which the
cross appears or that a certain num
ber of members have been added to
the Klan if one already exists.
As there has never been any sign
of a Klan here prior to the burning
of the crosses, it is believed that a
branch of the great American organi
zation has been established here.
The appearance of the crosses came
as a complete surprise to local resi
dents, many of whom were awakened
from their slumbers by the heavy
blasts. The crosses were burned
about 9:30 o’clock in the evening.

fumed, ridiculed and threatened.
But—soon they meekly report that
the Ku Klux Klan held a well-at

You see, American Protestants, un

But American Protestants, organised.
Well, that’s different.
TENNESSEE KLANSMEN
GIVE FLAG TO SCHOOL
Ceremonies Held Recently at
Nolensville—Elaborate
Program
NOLENSVILLE, TENN., March 10
--Noelnsville Klan, Nolensville, Ten

high school a flag. The Exalted Cy
clops of Andrew Jackson Klan No. 47,
Nashville, Tennessee, was the speaker
of the occasion and delivered a splen
did lecture on “Americanism.”
Little Miss Elizabeth Waller recit
ed a beautiful poem on “My Flag and
Your Flag.”
Prof. Jenkins of the high school
had arranged a splendid program,
including the singing of the “Star
Spangled Banner”’ and “Columbia,
the Gem of the Ocean,” and also on
behalf of the school accepted the
flag.
The school room was crowded with
citizens of the community and pu
pils of the school and quite an im
pression was created. The indoor
services were concluded with a pray
er and all repaired to the grounds
where a flag staff had been planted
and the flag was raised and lowered
to half mast.
Two students of the Hume-Fogg
high school at Nashville, members of
the R. O. T. C., very beautifully ex
emplified the ceremony of raising
the flag, assisted by two little girls,
giving the bugle calls as is done in
the army.
lusion with ticket scalpers, the Min
nesota boxing commissioner could
with propriety investigate ticket sales
at the armory, in Minneapolis, when
the last big boxing show was held.
-Those who wanted sl.lO general ad
mission tickets at the ticket booths,
after about 7 p. m., were told that
not one was left, but a ticket broker
stood near the booths, seemingly sup
plied with several hundred sl.lO tick
ets, and sold all of them at $1.50 each
to those who were turned down by
the regular ticket sellers. At least
two Minneapolis policemen saw this
going on and joked about it.
“Possibly nothing could have been
done to make this grafter turn back
his tickets for sale at the legitimate
price, but the suggestion is repeated
that the Minnesota commissioners
can do a real service by investigating
this activity, the first of its kind to
be noted this season. Any attempt |
to scalp fight tickets, or any other
kind, should be nipped in the bud.”
RELIGIOUS QUESTION
UP IN UTAH SCHOOLS
State Superintendent of Schools
in Conflict With Federal
Law
SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, March
6.—Use of Utah public schools for re
ligious classes by the Mormon church,
protested against at various times,
is prohibited in federal and state con
stitutions and Utah state statutes,
according to a legal opinion handed
down by Attorney-General Cluff, him
self a Mormon.
A recent order of Dr. N. C. Jensen,
state superintendent of education,
controverting this view and declar
ing his belief that there is no provi
sion excluding Christianity nor doc
trinal classes where it does not in
fringe on the regular school curricu
lum, has focused attention on the at
torney general’s opinion. The latter
was given 10 months ago, but did not
receive publicity until recently.
The attorney general’s opinion is
of more than local significance, since
numerous cities in the United States
have formed, or contemplate form
ing, classes of more or less experi
mental character, as part of the pub
lic school work.
The opinion analyzed legislative
references to this matter and empha
sized the understanding of members
of the Utah constitutional conven
tion of 1896, when stringent provi
sions were drawn against the injec
tion of church influence into state
affairs.
The recent order of Dr. Jensen has
produced an anomalous situation
which it is believed may not be de
termined without court action. Dr.
Jensen is, according to Utah statutes!
legal adviser of all school boards in
the state. His latest stand, there
fore, establishes the practice for all
the public schools, unless court man
date intervenes.
The state superintendent has been
quoted, at length as advising an east
ern Utah district school board not to
Eermit religious classes in the school
uildings during or after school
hours. His recent order reverses
this position.
In Philadelphia, New Yerk and Bos
ton, efforts are being made to enlist
support behind the effort of the Fed
eral Council of the Churches of Christ
in America to preserve the Christian
shrinea of Palestine. The Jerusalem
Patriachate of the Orthodox East
ern church is threatened with extinc
tion due to the disorders of this post
war period. This extinction, if com
pleted, would leave without Christian
protection, many of the historical
places associated with the life and
ministry of Jesus. In view of the
strategic relationship of Palestine to
Judaism and Muhammedanism, a
great significance attaches to this ef-
has been termed the
Ninth Crusade.
A Sport Story Written i
from ‘Different * Anfele
I’eter Schuyler, writing in the
Dearborn Independent developes a
sport stery from an entirely differ
ent angle. It will give the reader
something to think about, which Is
m> re than car. be said about the av
erage sport story.
‘ The possible repeal of the Walker
law, which permits boxing contests
to be given in New York state and
decisions rendered constitutes the
element of tragedy in the death of
Frankie Jerome, as far as sporting
Manhattan is concerned.
It must be understood in the be
ginning that there is no such thing
these days as a prize fight. That is
old stuff and belongs to the period
when pugilists fought with bare
knuckles or skin-tight gloves which
had the cutting power of a razor.
Heenan, Merrissey, Kilrain, Sullivan.
Mitchell, Fitzsimmons, and Peter
Jackson were fighters. The midgets
and the giants who wallop each other
in public nowadays are never, never
tiuhters. Their designation depends
on the law of the state or city where
they happen to be performing. Where
athletic events are permitted within
the squared circle, pugilists are ath
letes. Where “boxing contests” are
-motioned they are by statute, box
ers.
It must be plain, therefore, that
whatever legislative action may take
place which will spoil boxing graft,
it cannot be on the grounds of prize
fighting. Even state lawmakers can
not perform impossibilities. They
cannot destroy what does not exist
and to such a depth of national hy
pocrisy have we fallen, that we still
refuse to call things by their proper
names. There are no such things as
‘‘prize fights” either in Manhattan or
outside of it. There are only “boxing
contests” in which men are bloodied
beyond viewing, knocked into uncon
sciousness, and occasionally killed —
all that a few parasites, mostly
aliens, may live on the best without
earning the meanest, and that our
prehistoric blood lust may be ap
peased. Unlike the barbarian who
was proud of his animal achieve
ments, we are so cowardly that we
refuse to mention our bad habits by
name.
Strange to say, the agitation for
the stoppage of the fight graft in
Manhattan does not come from that
indeterminate group called the “Blue
Law fanatics.” Any person who at
tempts to kill petty larceny theft
(which our slanguage calls “graft”)
is in the eyes of the grafter of the
is in the eyes of the grafter or the
He is responsible for everything
which the individuals, whose sole
idea of liberty is to make money off
somebody else without working too
hard, describe as “the limitation of
personal liberty.” For once, how
ever, the B. L. F. is admittedly un
concerned in the repeal of the
Walker law.
A group of politicians which is
outside the existing monopoly is bent
on destroying the monopolists even
if they have to kill “boxing” to do
it. With them it is a case of “Let
us in on the core or there ain’t
going to be no core.” and hell hath
no fury like a politician cheated out
of his rightful whack at the loot.
Since the Walker law was passed,
the Temple of Swat for Manhattan
has been Madison Square Garden,
which is leased by Tex Rickard. Who
his associates are is not public prop
erty but it is alleged that they are
of sufficient importance to enable
the Garden to remain .the only big
“boxing” club in the city. Every
match of importance is held there,
the biggest stakes are offered there,
the champions, with few exceptions,
box for Rickard and for Rickard
only. There are some scattered
arenas where “contests” are held,
but the contestants are the small fry
of the fighting sea and they exists
simply because on the nignts for
which they have “cards” the Garden
is dark. Not only does Rickard stage
the only important indoor exhibi
tions, but he dominates completely
the outdoor affairs which are the
really great money makers. Justly
or unjustly he is said to be the Box
ing Trust of Greater New York and
Brooklyn, and he has made enemies
by reason of his alleged control of
the “sport.”
Still another factor has forced pub
lic consideration of the graft. That
is the succession of astounding deci
sions rendered by the judges of the
contests, the conduct of the “weigh
ing in” process by the officials con
cerned with that department of the
“sport” the summary treatment of

the representatives of the press,
and the presence and activities of
gamblers at affairs which are, ac
cording to the law, only presenta
tions of bodily skill connected witb
mental co-ordination.
What really underlies the agita
tions against the “sport” is the con
temptuous attitude assumed by its
adherents to all considerations of de
cency. People starve, living expenses
soar and human beings suffer priva
tion. On top of these conditions
and in the face of them, a hulk of
humanity called a “champion” re
fuses to pummel another hulk, who
wants to be the “champion,” unless
he gets half a million dollars for
doing it. Less important bruisers
refuse to contribute their services to
the cause of “boxing art” unless they
get a stipend for one night equal to
the salary of the President of the
United States for a year. The man
agers of “boxers” talk in hundreds
of thousands. The promoters of “con
tests” scorn the consideration of
anything but millions. A cauliflower
eared, alien-born illiterate a Jewish
mes.tal defective, or a half-brute
foreign immigrant who can scarcely
speak English, will appear in public
for forty-five minutes for twenty
five thousand dollars or a percentage
of the gate receipts that will amount
to more. For what? That the low
est elements of a city, the scum of a
state, the refuse of a nation, may en
joy imitation of the Coliseum in
Rome any time during the most de
cadent days of the Empire. Stripped
of all its grand pretense, the

of one man trying to smash another
into unconsciousness and being paid
to do it by a mob of howling sadists,
who. being cowards themselves, are
the first to detect the symptoms of
faint-heartedness in the fighters,
and the loudest to yell their discov
ery to the world.
The type is invariable. Fierce
eyes burning under the long peak of
a cap. Raucous voices, angry jost
lings, ugly arguments, whispering
knots along the gutters’ edge. Un
developed bodies, puny physiques,
sickly faces. Oily prosperity, sleek
hair, flashy clothes, diamonds, Abes,
Jakes, Moes on one side of the Gar
den. Snarling at the high-priced
ticket windows! Wrangling with
ticket speculators in almost every
tiny candy store, fruit shop, or to
bacconist coop which dots the side
streets.
On the other side of the Garden
more caps, rougher clothes, fiercer
eyes, angrier arguments, sporadic fist
fights for places in the ticket line,
more Abes, more Jakes, more Moes,
all clamoring for the smell of the
arena and the sight of blood. No
boxing contest in Manhattan is com
plete without its quota of women
observers. As affairs like the Leon
ard-Mitchell, and the Dempsey-Firpo
battles the feminine leaders of Man
hattan’s smartest society were pres
ent en masse. And near enough to
acquire a souvenir splash of crimson
for their pains. No one thinks any
thing about it unless perhaps it i»
the fighters themselves.
Meantime Frankie Jerome has been

concern now is lest the “sport” he
died participating in may be finished

money to be made in it? Money
talks! Sometimes it rattles —like the
bones of dead men. But Manhattan
should worry about that!
