Additional Letters From the People
(?) DIFFERENT BREEDS OF
SOCIALISTS.
Dear Sir: —I send you a copy of
the New York “Weekly People’’, a
Socialist Labor Party paper. Those
are the only genuine Socialists w 7 ho
always fight the Social Democrats, or
Kangaroos, because they are com
promises and frauds, and are repre
sented by Wilshire’s, Wayland’s,
New York Volkszeitung, etc. De
Leon, the able editor of the New 7
York People, answers some of your
arguments mildly, and I wished for
you to see it. You ought to ex
change with that paper, if possible.
That seems to be the genuine So
cialism acknowledged by the best in
formed people. The Kangaroos are
represented by such men as Debs,
Mitchell, Gompers, etc., who lead the
rank and file “haw, gee,’’ so that
they just get something out of it for
themselves. An S. L. P. Socialist
hews straight to the line, and he
never dares to accept nomination
and endorsement from any other
party or ticket as the Kangaroo al
ways does. You can make out the
rest. I give you credit of being a
man of backbone.
No other man (reformer) has the
bravery to attack Foreign Missions,
or that dangerous Roman Hierarchy,
etc., as you. That Roman Hierarchy
will, if allowed to go unchecked,
ruin any country on earth. I was
raised a Catholic, but there is noth
ing I hate worse than it.
Every one is entitled to his views,
but, it seems to me, if we are to suc
ceed in reform, and kill plutocracy,
we ought to tackle the main issue,
and free ourselves industrially first.
Those side-issues, such as prohibi
tion, are just helping plutocracy to
rule over us. The main issue first.
There are hundreds of thousands of
good reformers that long for reform,
but soon as you put in prohibition,
they run away from reform and sup
port any party that has the least to
do with it. These are as numerous
as the Prohibitionists are.
I am your good friend,
VINCENT J. STEDRY.

THIS WILL INTEREST DR.
BROUGHTON AND ONE OF
HIS DEACONS.
My Dear Mr. Watson:—After
reading Dr. Broughton’s challenge
and your reply, asking you to meet
him in joint debate on the Foreign
Mission question, will say that I
spent a month in Atlanta, begin
ning the 20th of August, 1909, and
attended services at Broughton’s
Tabernacle twice each Sabbath while
there. I boarded with a Mr. J. A.
Hughes, who deals in country pro
duce and runs a wagon yard,
No. 309 Marietta street. I insisted
that Mr. Hughes accompany me to
Broughton’s Tabernacle the first
Sabbath after I arrived in Atlanta.
As we went by his place of business
we stopped to water some stock that
he had in charge. And as the water
began to pour in the watering
trough near by something began
to groan, and on making some in
quiry as to Avhat it was, “Now,”
said Mr. Hughes, “that is why I don’t
go to Broughton’s Tabernacle no
more than I do.” Said he, “That’s a
pair of old mules that’s groaning for
water and won’t get a drop today,”
and said he, “they belong to one of
the deacons up at the Tabernacle,
who carries the Foreign Mission bas
ket around every Sabbath.”
And I went and looked in and saw 7
two old mules that were skinned
from head to foot, this on the east
side of a brick w r all where scarcely
any air could get, without any cover
over them, with the sun beaming
down on them so hot I don’t believe
any human being could stand it
twelve hours. And I was informed
by Mr. Hughes that those old mules
stood there through the winter of
1 908 and 1909 exposed to the cold
sleet and rain, without any shelter.
Now, I don’t know 7 whether Dr.
Broughton knew this or not, but
surely some one knew this besides
Mr. Hughes. Will say, in conclu
sion, that the Tabernacle and In
firmary are nice. But it’s hell on
the old mules, and, after all told,
the home missions don’t reach far
enough, for it ought to reach far
enough to put a shelter over the old
mules.
For reference, I refer you to Mr.
J. A. Hughes, residence, 36 Jones
avenue; place of business, 309 Mari
etta street, Atlanta; phone 3877.

A TRAVELING EVANGELIST’S
SENTIMENTS.
Dear Mr. Watson: —I am a reader
of your w 7 eekly and monthly Jeffer
sonians, and beg to say that I think
that you are placing before the pub
lic the greatest reading matter ever
published.
The stand that you have taken
against the late system of Foreign
Missions has indeed been a revela
tion of information to me.
I was greatly moved by the match
less and far-reaching article which
appeared in the November issue of
your monthly Jeffersonian, which
was entitled “Field of Home Mis
sion,” by Captain L. A. Odom.
This article made good in my mind
all that you have had to say along
the line of Foreign Missions. It pic
tured and typified its every declara
tion until no reasonable person could
find any room for an argument in
favor of the present method of For
eign Missions.
I must congratulate the Hon. Thos.
E. Watson for putting before the
public the real truth of the present
conditions of Foreign Missions.
I notice in the weekly Jeffersonian
of January the 6th an article written
by one Major White, who claims to
be in charge of the Salvation Army
forces in the South, which would re
flect on the article written by L. A.
Odom; however, if he had this in
view he made a dismal failure in his
attack.
Major White simply implies that
the Salvation Army is in the ring
with the rest of the people who are
engaged in taking bread from the
mouths of the hungry widows and
orphans of our own country and
sending it to other lands to help a
class that don’t need it in many
cases.
He states that the Army takes up
a collection once a year to do For
eign Mission work. If lam not mis
taken, these fellows take up two col
lections a year to do this kind of
work with, and I would not be sur
prised to see or hear of them taking
the third one, if they continue to fol
low after the example of others.
I am a traveling evangelist and
have had the opportunity of investi
gating the work of the Salvation
Army, as I have other organizations.
And have reason to know that these
people take bread from the mouths of
widows and orphans every time they
send away a dollar. Furthermore,
these leaders in this organization
tell their subordinate officers that if
they don’t raise this money for this
Foreign Mission work that their ap
pointment will be taken from them
and be given to some one else more
worthy.
Now, Mr. Watson, the above facts
are why I don’t believe in being
bound in the folds of an organiza
tion of red tape. Every one of these
organizations are full of religious
fanatics just like Major White.
I am not against Foreign Mission
work when it is done according to
the Bible, but when it comes to skin
ing the country for money and ac
tually robbing the poor of our coun
try of bread and raiment, it is too
much and time for somebody to
make a halt.
Assuring you of my best wishes
and my own personal esteem, I beg
to remain,
Very respectfully,
REV. J. B. BEAVERS.
Nashville, Tenn.
