Huguenot •Walloon
300 th Anniversary
Comes On April 27
The Protestant churches of lowa
4rill on Sunday, April 27', commemo
rate the Huguenot-Walloon tercente
nary. by appropriate sermons. These
people came to the United States in
1624 and after, to escape religious
persecution in Europe.
The celebration is fostered by the
Huguenot-Walloon New Netherland
Commission, Inc., sanctioned by the
Federal Council of Churches of Christ
(n America.
The following communication has
been sent to Protestant ministers
-throughout the United States by the
commission, over the names of Chas.
8. Mac Far land, chairman, and John
Baer Stoudt. director:
‘The Huguenots have taken a nota
ble part in the making and moulding
of our nation, as well as a distin
guiahed place in ecclesiastical his
tory. They came ‘bearing rich gifts,’
cot of money, but of spirituality,
faith, steadfastness, fortitude and en
ergy, and it seems very appropriate
that on the three hundredth anniver
sary of the coming of the first per
manent Huguenot colony we should
pause to remind ourselves of our debt
to their heroism, their brave struggle
■for liberty of conscience, and their
martyrdom for the faith. In these
arery days of dcubt and uncertainty,
.of economic distress and spiritual up
heaval. it is good for us to remember
the steadfast courage in the face of
persecution, the unwavering spirit
which made the Huguenot prisoners
write on the walls of their dungeons
In France the brave word ‘Resistez.’ ”
In a leaflet enclosed in the com
munication, the following brief his
tory of these brave people is given:
In May, 1924, a number of notable
oeleratlons will take place on tha
eastern coast of the United States.
First of all, the city of Albany will
.observe the three hundredth anniver
sary of its founding by a little group
(A Walloon refugees who disembarked
at “Fort Orange” in 1624 to conquer
the wilderness and wring a living
from the rough, unbroken soil. The
atate of New York, and in fact the en
tire middle states, will have a part in
this tercentenary,, for this little col
ony of only thirty-two families were
the first permanent settlers in tee
territoy then known as “New Neher
tand” and embracing roughly what
are now the states of New York,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Dela
ware. So much for the civic and his
toric background of the tercentenary.
Tbe national significance of this
obscure settlement lies in the fact
that it inaugurated the Huguenot
Immigration to America. The Wal
loon colonists, both French and Bel
gian, were Calvinists. For the crime
of heresy they were persecuted and
forced to flee to the northern prov
inces of the Netherlands, then in tn«>
midst of their long war of liberation
from the Spanish yoke. Inspired by
the brave adventure of the Pilgrims,

their fellow-exiles in Leyden, they,
too, determined to seek new homes
in the New World. The Dutch West
India Company granted them the
privilege of settlement in the vast
district claimed by the Netherlands
as a result of the explorations of Hen
ry Hudson, and they set sail in the
“Nieu Nederland” to found what
proved to be the first permanent Hu
guenot colony in America. Two ear
lier attempts made in 1562 by the
great Huguenot leader Admiral de
Coligny, under Jean Ribaut. at May
port, Florida, and Parris Island,
South Carolina, were unsuccessful,
the settlement at Mayport being
wiped out by the Spaniards in 1665.
No thoughtful person today wishes
to rake up the bigotry and religious
antagonism of those bygone days, or
revive the bitterness which then ani
mated the adherents of opposite
creeds, yet we cannot ignore tne fact
that through these influences great
numbers of earnest men and women
who set liberty and conscience above
Eersonal safety and economic well
eing, were brought to our shores
and helped to lay the foundations of
our national idealism as well as our
material prosperity. It is well that
we should, on the three hundredth
anniversary of their coming, recall
how fine and noble was the contribu
tion of the Huguenots to the up
building of our nation. April 27
has been set aside as “Huguenot-Wal
loon Tercentenary Sunday.” It would
be an appropriate inauguration of
the Tercentenary celebrations if on
that day the churches of America
would unite in honoring the memory
of those brave spirits whose stead
fast adherence to their faith was sym
bolized in their emblems: “The
church under the cross,” and “The
bush, burning, but not consumed.”

PROHIBITION AND
IMMIGRATION LAW
OPPOSED BY JEW
Representative Rosenbloom
of West Virginia Decides
to Run for Senator
Makes Grandstand Play With
Opinions of Enforcement of
Liquor Statutes
WHEELING, W. VA., April 17.
Benjamin Rosenbloem, Jewish Re
publican representative from the
first congressional district, who less
than a week ago stated that he would
not he a candidate for re-nomina
tion and who subsequently announced
his candidacy for the Republican
nomination to the United States sen
ate, is fast losing ground and the
foundation of his political support is
crumbling, according to a survey
made by this newspaper.
Even aliens, in whom lie Roeen
bloom's only hope of making a fair
showing in the coming election, hold
the Jewish congressman in low es
teem. An alien spoke the sentiments
of his fellowmen in the following
sentence: “Rosenbloom has never
done anything for the people except
light prohibition." While aliens are
vitally interested in the destruction
of prohibition they also want a man
who is for the “rank and file.”
Rosenbloom's aversion to the eigh
teenth amendment and his refusal to
support the Johnson immigration bill
will defeat* him. Rosenbloom is
against the eighteenth amendment
because he thinks it will make him
popular and he refused to support
the Johnson immigration bill “be
cause it places too great a hardship
on his countrymen." In reply to a
plea sent out by an American voter
asking him to support the Johnson
hill, “Representative” Rosenbloom de
clared that the measure “places too
great a hardship on my countrymen.”
He places his “countrymen,” who are
yet in Red Russia, before the inter
ests of American citizens who elected
him to the office he now holds.
In the first congressional district
many American voters declare that
Rosenbloom saw “the hand writing
on the wall" and knew that he could
not get the congressional re-nomina
tion. Having been fed at the public
trough for the past several years
and also having been bitten by the
political bee, the theory is expounded
that the Jewish congressman con
ceived the idea of trying«lo flirn flam
the voters throughout the state and
let his constituents in the first dis
trict, who are conversant with his
manner and methods, go hang. How
ever, it is believed that the anti-sa
loon league, churches, Ku Klux Klan
and other institutions for the ad
vancement of humankind will see
that the citizens of West Virginia
are informed as to the true character
of the would be senator.
Here are a few excerpts from a
speech made by Congressman Rosen
bloom in the house, February 22:
“Until nature’s law of fermenation is
either amended or repealed, you will
never be able to make absolute pro
hibition by legislation a workable
proposition.”
“It is not the excessive indulgence
in alcoholic beverages that makes
men poor; it is being poor that makes
men indulge in alcoholic beverages to
excess.”
“Congress attempted to eliminate
the demand by outlawing the sup
ply, paying no attention to the de
mand whatever.”
“You must admit that the present
law.is ineffective when I exhibit to
you a full page advertisement that
appeared in the newspapers published
in my home city of Wheeling, W.
Va., which has been under prohibi
tion legislation since 1914. This ad
vertisement appeared on January 3,
1924, and since this date, handed as
you can plainly see, in large type,
‘Better than Whisky.’ Notice the
word ‘whisky’ is set in such large
type that you can plainly see it from
any point in this chamber. As you
notice, on this page is a picture of
a bottle with a label on it, and in
plain figures in the information, Alco
hol, 10 per cent.”
The Jewish representative then
called attention to the directions
that were also published in the ad
vertisement. The preparation to
which Rosenbloom had reference was
“Aspironola.” The Hebrew congress
man then proceeded to hand hot
shots to the eighteenth amendment.
He spoke of Coca Cola as a “soft
drink” and then referred to “Aspir
onola” as something stronger. He im
parts the rare knowledge that both
products are manufactured in Atlan
ta, Ga.
Here is a part of what he says:
Now, gentlemen, this is unquestion
able a legal preparation (meaning
“Aspironola”) unquestionable within
our present prohibition laws, or it
would not have appeared in this pa
per. Can you, gentlemen, in any way
justify your objections to a mild beer
on the grounds that it would tend to
create an appetite for stronger drink,
when under our present laws, which
we are told by our champions are per
fect and which we must not lay un
holy hands upon, such advertisements
appear and such commodities are
sold to the men, women and children
of our country under such a thin dis
guise? Of course I can see why some
would udvocate why we should not
change the present iaw, because they
do permit the allowing of those who

Who wants the honor? This is the
opportunity of a life time for any
politician. American citizens want
to know who is backing Rosenbloom.
It is said that the Clarksburg Tele

nouncement with glaring headlines.
Is the Telegram the main pillar of
his support?
BUCKHANNON, W. VA., April 15.
-The Buckhannon Delta, Upshur
county's premier anti-Klan sheet, to
day announced that it would not
support Benjamin J. Rosenbloom,
Wheeling, for the Republican nomin
at ion to the United States senate.
The announcement came as a com-
Blete surprise to American voters in
pshur county.
Rosenbloom, who is of Hebrew ex
traction, and is alleged to be high in
the councils of the National Vigi
lance association, is bitterly oppose 4
to the Klan. He is also an avowed
enemy of the eighteenth amendment.
O. H. Barnes, editor of the Delta,
is a strong opponent of prohibition
and has attempted to run the Ku
Klux Klan out of Upshur county.
Barnes, it will be remembered, offer
ed to “gumshoe” for what he thought
were the liquor interests during the
memorable prohibition fight here
several years ago. The West Vir
ginia Fiery Cross carried an expose
of his offer to work for the liquor
interests by “gumshoeing” among the
voters. Barnes, did not want to take
an open stand. His letter in full to
the liquor interests was published.
Local voters are now ai a loss vo
know why the local editor would turn
against a man who stands for just
the things that Mr. Barnes has ad
vocated for years.
