"'Twenty men claiming to repre
DY sent the Democracy of the various
wards- met at the court-house last
Thursday and proceeded to take
IS, charge of the Democratic party of
this parish. They made no bones
about it, but coolly arrogated to
themselves the power which rests an
the voters alone. Who endowed
.at these gentlemen with the authority
w to speak for the Democracy of La
LJ fayette? Is it the handful of men
who met in the differeat wards and
appointed themselves as delegates to
9S. this most singular of all conven
an- tions? Have the people of this par
M ish ever been treated to such huge
Spri- political comedy and performed by
men who pretend to be serious?
95 The gentlemen who met at the
epre- court-house represent nothing ex
:ratiC cept themselves and a few honest
D. but deluded followers, and they
have no more right to speak for the
05 Democratic party than they have
pri- to speak for the Salvation Army or
1895 the Mormon Church. On the sa3d
of November they announced in
N. their official organ that they would i
hold primaries on the axth of thisa
rthe month, but finding that the Demo- I
emo- crats of the parish would refuse to
Dec. take part in such a ridiculous side- i
S. show not a single box was opened. a
To attempt to hold primaries and l
5s not to get any votes would be too
,hie clear an evidence of weakness, and
day, the commissioners named failed to b
;ut- show up at the appointed time and ti
m- place, and the primaries did not ma- p
terialize. But something had to be c
done to keep up appearances, and g,
eace word was sent out to the faithful in
no- the different wards that a conven
1. tion would be held at the court
. house Thursday to appoint dele- p,
:ace gates to the State, senatorial and m
r judicial conventions. A few men
r in some cases not more than half a le
dozen-met at the different pre- E
d cincts and appointed themselves ec
ri- delegates to this great convention, C
which had the audacity to appoint to
delegates to represent the Democ- s
3d racy of the parish at the State, D
ries judicial and senatorial conventions. at
In the matter of the district and a
senatorial nominees they tell us
that the delegates are to vote Al
of for the candidates receiving lo
ish the highest number of votes at the lit
to white primary election called by ..f
their rump committee for the azst tu
of March. Right here let us ex- tal
press the opinion that the March
co primary will turn out to be as dis- th
ur- mat a failure as the primary of last dii
Wednesday. After having most m
signally failed to hold the primary br
Va- which they announced for the zith an
at they are making a desperate effort the
Id to prolong their bluff by prating sm
about their March primary. What W
e guarantee have the Democrats of De
, the parish that the March primary mc
will ever see the light of day? Like loo
its twin-brother of the uxth, it died gal
a-borning.
Before closing this article we de- it
sire to ask how the delegates from
this (Lafayette) precinct were elect- Fie
d ed? If it was by "mass meeting" tha
we have failed to ascertain where it de
d was held and how large it was. We
n are inclined to believe that the al
If leged "*mass meetings" in the other aftt
wards bore a marked resemblance to ing
the one which did not take place in hav
f this precinct.

the "finances have been well man
