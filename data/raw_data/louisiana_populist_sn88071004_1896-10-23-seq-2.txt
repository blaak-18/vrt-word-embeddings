See in Mr. Crawford's letter a
brilliant scheme of the boss ballot
box stuffer of Bossier, Col. Ogden,
who never fails to stuff out Demo
crats in the primaries and Popn
lists in general elections whenever
they get in his way. Wonder how
long Ogden will continue to run
this district by fraud.

No or. man dares to buck up
against Ogden's fraud and ballot
box stuffing even in a Democratic
primary. Four of them tried it
this year, but Bossier's fraud
knocked them all out at one round,
Thisyear,while the Pemocracy is
trying to sedeem itself, hold a fair
election, and knock off such barna
cles, would be a good time to vote
for Bailey and get rid of this fraud.

' Editor Populist:--ln my still
hunt for Mr. Bailey for Congress,
It I find many more Populists in this
I1 section than is generally supposedl;
and many Democrats say that since
the Populists have proven their
devotion to free silver and princi
ple by party sacrifices and are in
P this State loyally supporting Wm.
Bryan for President, they
t shouldlhave the congressmen in the
d4th and 5th districts, and such
Demoorats will vot3 for Bailey.
But II. W. Ogden is working a
r slick scheme to land himself in this
district. He tells every one that it
e is necessary to vote the nero and
every body else on election day to
save the State to Bryan-knowing
as he does that all machine-made
P votes will be for him as well as for
: Bryan. He told me that Bossier
t (his parish) would cast 5000 votes
in this election- that 75 per cent
) of the negroes there could read.
.Well I decided to investigate,
Judae J. T. Watkins, who holds
District court in Bossier says not
* more than 20 per cent of the ne
* groes there can read. Sen, N. C.
Blanchard, who knows something
of Bossier said that a fair election
in Bossier would result in about
1100 votes, Hon. John Pickett, a
resident of Bossier and long fa
miliar with its politics endorses
the statements of the other distin
a guished gentlemen.
But I went into the parish to see
for myself and around Knox Point,
f Haughton and the intermediate
country I handed my card to four
negroes at one place and not one
could make out my name in plain
print, at another four out of fifteen
could read it and .at still another
I three out of twenty read i.t. All
these negroes toldl me that they
never went to the election and did
not intend going this time.
So you can see CoL Ogden's ob
jet is to persuade the commission
ers and other election officers that
it is necessary to stuff to save Bry
am in this State, so as to get the
staled vote for himself.
But many Democrats know bet
ter are tired of ballot-box stuffing
sad are equally tired of Mr. Or
den. who has stuffed and swindled
in every Democratic primary he
has ran in.
I Ihd the great majority of the
honest silver Democrats are pleas
ed with the fusion and are deter
mined to stand by us for a fair elec
tion, and hence will vote against
Mr. Ogden if be attempts to vio
late the fusion agreement which he
pretended to be so anxious for.
Bailey is almost sore to be elect
ed.
Yours,
J. H. Crawford.

The Triumph of Populism.
Col. hooker, referring to the
statement that the Democrats had
stolen their platform from the
Populists, said it was a good plat
form no matter where it came
from. Bryan pays the highest
tributes to the patriotism and in
telligence of the Populists. Their
aid is eagerly sought for in every
State. "The stone that the build
ers rejected has become the chief
of the corner stone."
Not only our principles but our
votes are in great demand. The
voice of slander is being silenced.
Our candidates are receiving res
pectful consideration and atten
tion. Our leaders are being con
suited. What a mighty change!
But the half has not been told.
The greatest triumphs of Popu
ham are yet to come. The old
parties may fume and rage, but
they cannot get away from the is
sues we have made for them. The
bone and sinew, the rank and file,
the sum and substance of this great
land are the farmers who are in
the Populist party. Around their
standard, the forces of reform will
rally. No great reform, no great
measure of relief can come from
the ol l parties. They have not
Sot the inspiration of enthusiasm
and zeal.
This great campaign is a tri
umph for Populism whose child it
is. There is every reason why
our people should be more united
and zealous than ever. Our Na
tional Committee has just issued a
grand address calling on all Pop
ulists to stand firm around the
great standard of free silver,
which Bryan holds aloft. The
Populists will-respond in a patri
otic spirit and the triumph which
is sure to come will shed a full
share of glory on Populism.
Monroe Bulletin.
Honest Elections.
Republicans of late years have
talked much about the intimida
tion of negro votes in the South.
The worst intimidation that was
ever seen in this country is now
being practiced by railroads and
other corporations towards their
employees.
The "shot gun policy" of the
South cannot compare with it.
Where a laborer is dependent
upon a certain job to keep his
family from starving-to tell him
that he will lose his job unless he
votes for MeoiSley is worse than
shot ran coercion.
Still this kind of coercion is be
ing practiced by corporations from
one end of the country to the other
to force laborers to vote for Mc
,rley and the gold tsandard.

POPULIST SPEAKING.
Hon. B. W. Bailey will speak
in behalf of his candidacy for
Congress in the 4th District at
the following places and dates.
Mr. Bailey represents those
principles which have captured
the Democratic party, and are now
sweeping the country, and all good
silver people should vote tor him.
The Democratic leaders have
promised a fair division of elec
tion officers in every parish in the
district, and they are making
strong efforts to carry it out.
With a fair election Mr. Bailey
will carry the district, and Popit
lists should take courage and let
no failure rest on them.
