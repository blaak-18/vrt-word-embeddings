TIlHE POSITIONS OF LOUISI AN
TROOPS
During the Siege-Remnants of the
Long Ago--A Remarkable In' -
dent-Veterans Visiting.
The generations of today have little
knowledge of Vicksburg, Miss., in the
historical struggle between the North
and the South, which has challenged
the admiration of the world. It ;was
forty years ago when grey headed mcn
now where beardless boys then. s ith
stood the siege of the army four to onu
under Grant supported by a powerful
fleet of gunboats, starved into s,.bmis
sion as gallant a body of men .is ever
faced the enemy in defense of pri1ci
ples and their country. It was not intil
this band of men, a hopeless min-rity
against the Federal hordes equipp I
with the best arms of the day. surret.
dered when almost starved and redtuced
in fighting numbers in a sense to a cor
poral's guard, that Grant became the
master of Vicksburg. In this histor;e
struggle. as in eve'-y conflict through
out the campaigns conducted un.der
Lee and Jackson in Virginia, in 'lary
land and in Pennsylvania, and under
Albert Sidney Johnston and Beaur,
gard, Bragg, Joe Johnson and Hoodl in
the thrilling campaigns in Ken'uck..
Tennessee and Georgia, the Louisia'::
troops bore their part conspicniouslv.
The Louisiana brigades in. Virginia
were talismen of victory or desperate
resistance. and the Louisiana bri-e.ales
in the army of Tennessee has a recrn;d
for persistent and untiring sold;ervy r Il
heroic fighting never surpassed in the
history of warfare.
One afternoon when Hood was en
route to Nashville, Tenn.. af'--r th
Louisiana brigade, supported by more
than one hundred pieces" of artdilcrv
belching destruction and carnage in
every direction, had crossed the T-:t
nessee river. General Stephen L'. L_
and a few of his staff rode to the ba.k
of the river and inquired anxiousiv of
the captain in the last pontoon boit
who were these troops crossing, and
the captain replied that it was th.e
Louisiana brigade. General Stephen it.
Lee smiled approvingly and remarke'1
"We are safe," and rode away. And nt
sooner were they on the other sle
than they were in action and drov, the
enemy away and sustained their posi
tion tintil reinforced and the pontoon
bridges had been laid over the river on
which the army of Tennessee cro.-ced

During the siege of Vicksburg tlie
Louisiana troops were conspicuoti for
their gallantry under the most t-ying
ordeals, and it is gratifying to note thiat
among the number selected by Gov
ernor Heard to locate the positions oc
cupied by the Louisiana regiments were
included on the board Captain ,. B.
McCutchen and F. A. Hilley of Sh:evc
port, who have returned home after
spending several days in the historic
city most pleasantly.
The following is a list of the vet
erans who met in Vicksburg: William
C. Ellis. First Louisiana heavy artil

Toby Hart. Eighth Louisiana battalion,

ville: Victor Latour. Twenty-second
regiment infantry, New Orleans; T. J.
Royster, Twenty-second regiment in

One of the remarakble incidents
was the recovery by, Captain McCutch
en o fa piece of shell and a minie bul
let which he had buried in a spot which
he described before reaching it and
whidh'recalled the fact that at the time

The Louisiana tr,aops at Vicksburg.
in Virginia and in Tennessee were not
only fighters but good providers of the
necessaries and substantials of life
Great stories could be related of them
and their wonderful skill of appropria
tion. One of the stories, never disputed.
is that on a change of position the
Third Louisiana. in rags and tatters,
uwithout tents and bare of cooking
equipments, appeared the following
morning almost in new dress and well
supplied with "cook pots and grub" to
the consternation of the Mississippi
regiments nearby who could not ac
count for this transformation, but who
kept "mum" knowing full well that any
intimation would lead to a call for the
proofs and a row. Almost the same in
cident occurred in Virginia when after
a snowball fight with the Tennessee
brigade, who were "flanked" and
driven from the field. On returning to
their camp the Louisianians were well
provided and the Tennesseans were
left to wonder how it all happened.
The duty of this commission has
been well done and in the location of
the troops engaged in this struggle the
commissioners were assisted by Gen
eral Stephen D. Lee, Captain Rigby of
the Park Commission and others as
distinguished in peace as they were in
war.
In time there will be monuments
erected to establish the positions of the
troops in this memorable struggle, but
the fierceness if the conflict is best in
dicated by the National cemetery where
over 14.ooo Federal soldiers are bur
ied. During this siege thousands of the
South's noblemen yielded their lives in
defense of home and constitutional lib
erty, and though their voices he silent
and their seats at home vacant forever.
their heroism and self sacrifice should
ever be a most precious And sacred
heritage to their loved ones.
A MUSICAL TREAT
At the Opera House Monday, May II.
by Mrs2 Adah Hollingsworth
Watkins.
The Caucasian is pleased to note thatl
on Monday night, May II, Mrs. Adah
Hollingsworth-'Watkins will give a.
musical entertainment in the opera
house, during which she will sing in
appropriate costume "Three Centuries
of American Ballads," which have de
lighted large and cultured audiences in
New York. Mrs. Hollingsworth-Wat
kins was reared in Shreveport and has
won the highest meed of praise. 'The
New York Press of recent date in re
ferring to a concert given by Mrs. Wat
kins, says:
"Mrs. Hollingsworth-Watkins' con
cert presenting 'Three Centuries of
American Ballads' supplied a distinct
want of a large portion of the musical
public and left her enthusiastic audi
ence in an Oliver Twist mental attitude
calling for 'more.' Her program of 24
numbers was varied and interpreted
with discrimination, delicacy and
strength. Charmingly costumed accord
ing to the quaint but rich simplicity of
Colonial days. Mrs. Hollingsworth
Watkins, who has a soprano voice of
wide range, sang'the first group of her
songs. Special mention should be made
of the manner in which 'Can Love be
Controll'd by Advice?' and 'The Lass
with the Delicate Air" were rendered by
Mrs. Hollingsworth-Watkins' exquis
itely sweet and remarkably flexible
voice. The 'Songs of Ante-Bellum
Days.' the period between 1830 to 1860,
were next sung. In giving this second
group, Mrs. Hollingsworth-'Watkiris
wore the costume of that day, which, if
it produced a smile in the rendering of
'Gai'y the Troubadour,' was followed
by the tribute of a tear to the soulful
singing of Mary of Argyle.' Mrs. Hol
lingsworthsWatkins sang at the close
'Songs of the Present Day.' In Chad
wick's 'Allah' her dramatic power made
itself felt, as indeed it had at times
throughout the program. In 'Moods'
(song cycle), Rogers, the four render
ings were given with peculiar power."
Mrs. Hollingsworth-Watkins will be
assisted by local talent and we bespeak
for her the success commensurate with
her accomplishments.

WEATHER BULLETIN
The Cool, the Warm and the Storm
Waves Forecasted.
(Copyrighted I9o3 by W. T. Foster.)
Washington, April 25.-Last bulletin
gave forecasts of disturbance to cross
the continent April 26 to 30, warm
wave 25 to 29, cool wave 28 to May 2.
Next disturbance will reach Pacific
coast about April 30, cross west of the
Rockies by close of May I. great cen
tral valleys 2 to 4. eastern states 5.
Warm wave will cross west of the
Rockies about April 30. great central
valleys May 2, eastern states 4. Cool
wave will cross west of Rockies about
May 3. great central valleys 5, eastern
states 7.
This disturbance will belong to a high
temperature period, its storm center
will move through midlatitude state..
its cool xsave will carry forsts unus,:
ally far southward and its movement
will be slowly eastward.
This disturbance will be one of the
principal rain-makers of the month, but
not very much rain will result. The
weatlher will remain unusually cool sev
eral days not far from 7 and this will
be a bad time for recently planted corn
as it will grow but little and much of it
will rot. Better not plant corn in north
ern states before May I6.
Youngstown (Ohio) Vindicator of
March 29 said: "People who watch the
weather predictions of W. T. Foster
in the Vindicator have noticed the re
markable accuracy with which he has
hit the changes during the present
month, particularly his forecast of
warm wave, rains, cold wave and
snows. Some months ago the Vin'li
cator called attention to the manner in
which the predictions have been fil
filled. The forecasts by Mr. Foster are
proving themselves of inestimal'e
-alue."
