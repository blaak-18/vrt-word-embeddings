An Old Friend of His Wife.
ST 9AYUrtL TUr BCIUm.
The following good story, with
alight variations, was told to as by a
friend some time sinee.
He claims that it has never been
in print and we believe hiom.
But hem it is:
Brown and Robinson we'e boy
hood friends. They lived in the
nome neighborhood, went to the
me schbool, and stole apples from
the same orcbakd.
It was in a small hamlet in the
western part of New `York that they
resided, and there they both grew to
mmanhood.
Upon attaining his majority, Rob
inson went West and settled in Iowan
while Brown remained in his native
"illge.a
For some years they heard
nothing of each other.
In the mean time both had mar
ried, Robinson taking a blushing
prairie flower as a life companion,
and Brown settling down in the
matrimonial hbrness with one of his
oki asboolmates, a buxom damsel,
who, in her girlhood days, answered
to the bngnomen of Sallie Smith.
In the course of time Brown de
termined to make a visit to Iowa
and see his old-time friend, Robin
son.
So be started without sending no
ties of his coming, thinking thereby
to give Robinson t lurptie party, so
to speak.
Arriving at his destination, he in
quired for Robinson, and by good
leak ebanedd to ind him in town.
Of course Robinson was delighted
to meet an old friend of his youtb
iol days, and they greeted each thb
er with a bluff heaty welcome.
` After -few minntes conversation,
they adjourned to the nearest hotel,
seated themselves in comfortable po
sitions for a long chat, at the saae
time orderinng a bottle of 'wine in
which torenew friendship's pledges
Soon Robinson, as was natural,
"began to inquire as to the welfare
a:nd whereabouts of the people he
used to know before he came West.
'Where is Jim Higgins?" inquired
BRqinson, "the jolly old fellow who
kept the Eagle House."
"Jim's dead; died five years ago,'
replied Brown mournafully.
"Kicked the booket, eh ? 5hat',
%to bad. Nice lever fellow, Jim
wasr, too Where's Jack mith, the
ypugcoss, who oeed to get into so
Uask west to California they
say ieis getting rich there.".
"And Jack'e sister, allie'
(Brown's wile the reader will re
ea . of which if.. Bobiesso was
ignorant), what became of her ?"

reglgsy, with a slight twinkle in
hi. eye
married, eh t Well, Saldlie was a
olid girl, sad I hope shie got a good
huband. I used to be pretty. inti
tIate with Sallie when we went to
qahoo together (boys iiU be boys

I qaght to have married her mysell

Now, tvbat does this mean? £A
State election was held in California
lsat month which resulted in the tri.
umph of the Democrats by a vote
exceeding that given to the IRepub
lican and Independent tickets com
bined; but news comes that at a sub
sequent election for judges and a
Superintendent of Education, wbic~ i
occnrred on the 13th iget., the Re
pubtlean candidate for the litter of
flee was snccessful. We are at a d
loss to account for the relmarkable
change in public sentiment which
this indicates, nnlts it be that the
causes of local division which exists
among Itepdblicans as to the gov- '
ernment of the State do not extend fu
to the educational department. We ti
believe that Californlia is a Iepnbli- t
can State--tbhat the Republican par- m
ty when united comprises a thajority be
of the voters-and the latter elec- gc
tion seems to confirm this opinion.-
[Donaldsonville Chief, Oct.

looking horse into town, and stop- (l

a small boy to hold him a moment. A
"Hold him l' exclaimed the boy; a'
'just lean him up against the post-
that'll hold him." S
