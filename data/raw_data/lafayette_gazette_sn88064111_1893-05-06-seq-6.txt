The conaition of the treasury when
Mr. Cleveland resumed oee -is in
striking contrast with what it Wrs
when he entered upon the presideney
eight years ago. The so-called treas.
ury surplus was then beginning to as
sume large proportions, and it grew
steadily until its amount in excess of
the 8100000,,000 gold reserve for the ie
demption of notes, and $S0,000,000 .of
fractional and minor coin, sad a numt
ber of other -items which have singe
been absorbed into the general cash
account, became $80,000,000-in July,
1888, and $110,000,000 in April, 1886.
This great amount has since been so
efectually wiped out that, in spite of
various c'anges of bookkeeping with.
a view to increasing the apparent bal
ance it has recently been a questiop
whether the treasury could keep up
the appearance of any surplus at all.inj
excess of the 8100,000,000 reserve.
For the first fiscal year which closed
a few months after Mr. Cleveland en
tered office, the receipts of the govern-`
ment were more than $100,000,000 in
excess of its ordinary expenditures.
and throughout his term of office the'
management of a redundant revenue
was among its serious problems. All
this has been changed under the in-:
finence of the increasing scale of pub
lic expenditures, until the treasury sur
plus has disappeared and the revenues
barely sufficient for the current needs,
and the requirements of the sinking
fund law are ignored.
The change in the money circulation
of the country has been quite as great
as in the condition of the treasury.
'the expansion of more than $300.
000,000, which has occurred during the
eight years is fully accounted for by
the increased issue of silver paper; the
outstanding silver certificates being
greater in amount by more than $00,
000,000 than in March, 1885, and more
than $125,000,000 O .the new treasury
notes having been (ssued under the
Sherman law.
There can be-no question as to the
significance of these changes in finan
cial conditions and. nO room for doubt
as to the duty which they impose. The
scale of public expenditure which has
wiped out the great, treasury surplus
of a few-years ago must be reduced
and the silver legislation which is
draining the government. of its gold
and undermining its power to preserve
the interehangeability of its currency
issues aunst be repealed.
The conditions thateonfront the new
administration differ widely from those
of eight years ago, and yet the main
source of danger-and difficulty is one
that then existed and was elearly rec
ognized by Mr. Cleveland. Silver pur
chase legislation had already become a
source of anxiety and financial dis
turbance, and Mr. Cleveland applied
himself from the day of his election to
the task of averting its dangers. The
expedients which he adopted, and
others that have since been tried, are
now well nigh exhausted, and nothing
remains, if the worst of the threatened
results are to be escaped, except the
prompt repeal of the silver law.
There is as yet little definite knowl
edge of the intentions of the now ad
ministration in regard to financial
policy, and assumptions on the subject
are unwarranted. Mr. Cleveland and
Mr. Carlisle have properly refrained
from committing themselves in ad
vance, and kept themselves free to act
as the ease may require when they as
sume responsibility. Temporary make
shifts are not now to be considered.
Tlhe prosperity of the country for the
next four years depends on the prompt
avowal of a policy that will ensure
financial stability and confidence, and
the new administration must meet the
requirements of the emergency.-N. Y.
Commercial Bulletin.
CONDITION OF THE TREASURY.
Faets Revealed by the Dlspiaeement of
the tRepublican Admlnistratio,,.
The administration which sought to
escape censure by concealing the truth
from the people has gone. The admin
istration has come which proposes to
deal with the people in entire candor
and straightforwardness. Its first duty
to the country, to the party and to
itself is to make public at the earliest
moment a truthful statement of the
condition of the treasury. Upon that
condition at the preaen$ jupcture al
most everything dependsi.the need of
an extraordinary session of congress,
the opportunity for a reduction of tariff
taxation, the several currency ques
tions, the necessity for a new draft
upon the national credit. Before this
question the matter of appointments
to office drops relatively into insignifi
cance. The former is imperative; the
latter can wait. The business of the
country is concerned in an exact knowl
edge of the treasury situation and of
the steps taken to meet it; the prefer
ences of localities as to persons are
concerned in the appointments. The
administration must and will meet the
greater and more pressing problem
first.
The dispatch of Col. A. K. McClure
to the Philadelphia Times unquestion
ably anticipates in a general way the
specific staten~ent whichecr-etary Car
lisle must soon issue to the country. It
points to a deficit in the treasury, so
considerable that on the last full day
of his term Secretary Foster refused
to meet an obligation of $3,000,000
because there was no money on
hand to pay it.. It asserts tlha;t the
gold reserve of $100,000,000 has been
invaded and is now short by seven or
eight millions of dollars. and thus ex
plains why the last debt statement by
Mr. Foster on the first of the month
lacked the usual announcement of the
free gold on hand in the treasury. The
only pretext offered by the Harrison
administration for its policy of evasion
and concealment has been that the full
truth would complicate the situation
and render disentanglement more difli
cult. Were the United States an in
dividual, the excuse raight hold good;
but we are bound to assume that the
national credit will be respected and
that it can be impaired in no other
way so insidiously and effectively as
b p a supressio of the facts. To state
plainly an evil is to take the first step
toward its correction, and retrench
meant, whenever possible, will enlist
popular approval just as soon as the
need of it to meet a present exigency
is clearly set forth.
It is very evident that one of the
earliest acts of the administration
must be the issue of bonds. The last
administration, uuder an equally press
ing necessity, chose to neglect this
duty rather than face the censure
which such a confession of mismanage
meat, or worse, would evoke. Tile

The income tax is a less evil than the
prohibitive tariff tax. and if it should

hesitate to advocate the levy.
There has not been the least change
in democratic intentions. The McKin

not a prohibitive tax left in it.-St

POINTS AND OPINIONS.
-The craze republican spoilsmen
have for holding on to contemptible
jobs in the federal service is indeed
disgusting to every friend of reform.
St. Louis Republic.
--Where is the financial depression
tlih republicans predicted? The news
indicates that if we have had any it
died with the republican administra
tion.-St. Paul Globe.
-The country has been under com
plete democratic control several days.
It will be observed that the sky has not
fallen nor the fountains of the great
deep broken up.-N. Y. World.
- --The republicans who are relying
on Mr. Cleveland to blunder them back
into office are likely to be badly disap
pointed. Mr. Cleveland does not pro
pose to drop the democratic bread or
the buttered side.-St. Louis Republic.
- Almost any republican paper is
now willing to admit that North Da
kota has as bad a lot of republicans as
they claimed the citizens of Utah or
New Mexico were when the admission
bills were under discussion.-St. Paul
Globe.
-Mr. Cleveland was in November,
182. what he had been known to be
for years, and he was made president
because of that knowledge. The peo
ple got exactly what they wished, and
knew exactly what they were getting.
-N. Y. Times.
--"That part of Cleveland's in
augural which pertains to the currency
reads very much as it it had been left
over by Harrison."-St. Louis Globe
Democrat,
But there was precious little of the
currency left over by Harrison.-Louis
ville Courier-Journal.
- No public documenthas appeared
in this country for many a year so ab
solutely pervaded with the sanity of
statesmanship, so free from the taint
of partisan politics, so far above the in
fected atmosphere of demagogy, as the
address which Mr. Cleveland delivered I
on taking the oath of office for the
second time a# president of the United.
States.-N. Y. Times.
-The most suspicious feature of
Mr. Harrison's administration was the
haste with which he sent in his Chilian
message and his Hawaiian treaty. The
new administration is evidently not
afraid that Hlawaii will be swallowed
up by the sea or be blown away by the
winds. It has not the republican dread
of "tidal waves," "earthquakes." "cy
clones" and "landslides."-Louisville
Courier-Journal.
-There was a net increase of the
public debt for the month of February
of i615,699. Our revenues are large,
but our expenditures are larger. It is
not at all improbable that one of the
first things that the Cleveland adminis
tration will have to do will be to bor
row money to keep the federal pot
boiling until an opportunity shall have
been presented for remedial reform
legislation.-Philadelphia Record.
- Secretary Carlisle's first official
act was the exchange of a million do!.
lars of treasury notes for an equal
amount of gold tendered by the bank
ers of Denver. This transaction will
assist in some degree in relievinog the
pressure upon the treasury for gold for
export to Europe, but if the amount
was increased tenfold it would not be
more than sufficient to meet the ex
igency forced upon him by the transfer
of an empty treasury by his predeces
sor.-Chicago Herald.
