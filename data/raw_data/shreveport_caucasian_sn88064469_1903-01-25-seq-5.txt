did not herAlf accumulate this wealth,

The fact is that at present women
bank presidents are not at all rare in
the smaller cities of the Union. In al
most every instance they have shown
themselves eminently capable of hold
ing such places. Woman is a better
economist than man; she is more exact
and careful in matters of detail. where
she has any sense at all.
At any rate, la~e up to date banking

For Summer.
Scarcely has lovely woman recovered
from the fatigue of Christmas and
New Year's when she finds that she
must take tp the white woman's bur

behold!'they are full of the new silks
and the dainty thin goods for next sum
mer. Just think of it! It seems to
be an unwritten law that early in
January the white underwear sales
take place, and they are followed by
the advance of all the lovely and deli
cate materials for summer. This is
done so that during the forty days
wherein women fast and repent they
are enabled still more to mortify the
flesh by dressmaking, for, be it
known, most of the summer frocks are
made at this time. If there is any one
thing more certain than another to

Woman and
The Old Man
to the talk of the old man.
By "old man" I mean the old
style man of any age from
twenty-five to 105. I have come to the
conclusion it is time for the old man to
reconstruct himself to lit the new wom
an. If he does not, he will find himself
left. This old man I listened to was a
very old man. His opinions are those
of the age of Tiglath Pileser and Je
honadab. He thinks man knows it all
and woman knows nothing except as
man imparts it to her. His defintion
of a man is anything that wears trou
sers. This old man was talking to some
new women. They had learned in their
childhorl that two and two make four.
It may be mentioned that they could
read Latin; also that they knew how to
pronounce French. Spanish and Ger
man. But the man was a Briton, there
fore a doubled and tw;sted old man.
Yet that ancient and mildewed old man
sat there and told the- women of the
geography. the politics and the govern
ment of their own.country with the air
of one who was announcing great
truths which the women would never
have heard if Providence by special act
had not raised him up to announce
them. You observe this is a way
men have--old men, that is. They pat
ronize the whole feminine sex and en
deavor to explain things down to its
capacity. They expect to do all the
talking, so as to exploit their knowl
edge. They resent it if a woman pre
sumes to know anything out of her
own head. Such a female crleature is
extremely unwomanly in the eye of the
old.man. She makes him feel hurt in
his vanity; therefore he never likes her
afterward. But the old man is being
jarred in his vanity every day these
times. Will he learn thereby that he
must reconstruct himself and become a
new man to match the new woman?
A man who is neither the old man
nor the new on the woman question,
but who is just lying low anti taking
obsirvations. confesses himself per

Intelligent bachelor of thirty-five or
thereabout, not old enough to be

A Fault Which tlay Spoil Yout
Child's Success In Life.
"Won't your little daughter play for
me?" The visitor's voice was full of
graceful expectation. Little Bessie
smiled back at her and arose from her
seat.
"Oh, I'm afraid you wouldn't care to
hear lher. = .t"te doesn't play very well.
I never ca~.-et her to practice." said
the mother.

Mothers, if you have self conscious
