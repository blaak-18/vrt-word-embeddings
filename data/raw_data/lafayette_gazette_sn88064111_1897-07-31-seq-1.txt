At Scott a Great Success-A Hand
some Sum Realized.
Two Days of Uninterrupted Pleasure
-A Well-Managed Affair.
Lastnlaturday and Sunday it was Great
Scott sure enough. There was nothing
small about that thriving little town. Its
People had donned their holiday attire for
the~fair whose success meant so much for the
ata~m prosperity of that thrifty community.
The men, women and children turned out
apd welcomed the visitors from neighboring
al 'distant towns, who had come to have a
good time and to lend a helping hand in a
worthy cause. The large number of people
present and the representative character of
the crowd was indubitable evidence that in
heir present laudable undertaking the en
terprising citizens of Scott have the support
of the entire population of this parish, with
the exception perhaps of one or more egotis
ticpl persons whose narrow vision will not per
siit them to see some good in any movement
or undertaking which is not calculated to
swell their bank accounts. Fortunately
those pay-triotic citizens are generally known
to be actuated by motives not altogether dis
interested and their opposition to the church
-movement will do no appreciable injury to
the t noble cause which the good people of
Scott and vicinity are so energetically en
I.ed in promoting.
-Early Saturday the people began to ar
rive and every indication pointed to the fact
bthatthe first day of the fair would be a suc
cess even beyond the expectations of the
ost sanguine. Throughout the day the
different booths were visited by many people
and before night enough money had been
-ealized to insure the success of the under
taking. Messrs. Alcide Judice, Alex Budro,
Leo Judice and Albert Trahan aud their
able corps of assistants were indefatigable in
their efforts to carry out successfully every
feature of the day's program. At night the
entertainment was pronounced by all present
as a most creditable aHair. The program
was as followr.
Overture, instrumental music........ Misses Liz
zie Mudd and Bella Jndice.
Song, "In the Baggage Coach Ahead".......

Aftor the rendition of the program the
young folks indulged in dancing and kept
time with the melodious strains of the
Breaux Bridge and Loreauville bands until
the small hours of the night.
Sunday was an eclipser. A vast throng
of people moved about the beautiful Cayret
grove from the early morning hours till the
lusty chanticleers of the neighborhood an
nounced the advent of another day.
During the day a very interesting game of
base ball was played by the Pilette and
Scott clubs, which resulted in a score of t6
to to in favor of the Scott club. The de
feated nine immediately after the game
challenged the victors to another game.
The shooting tournament, under the di
rection of Leo Judice and Nathan Brous
sard, proved to be a howling success. The
Crowley Gun Club was represented by
Sheriff E. W. Lyons, Lionel Lyons and
Fleet Coleman; the New Iberia Gun Club
by A. and Geo. Cousin, Sidney Harry and
Alice Landry; New Orleans City Park Gun
Club by R. Steckler, A. Cordona nnd Alexis
Voorhies; Ltentury Club of Lafayette by Dr.
F. E. Girard, J. C. Nickerson, S. R. Park
orson and others; the Scott Gun Club by
twenty members. Sheriff Lyons, Lionel
Lyons and Sidney Harry scored six out of
a possible six, and all three shot again to
decide the contest. This time Mr. Harry
emerged the victor, Lionel Lyons and
;..Acadia's genial sheriff made only five points.
The concert was equally as good as the
one given the previous night. The follow
iag was the program:

Alcide Judice and Alex Budro know how
to manage a fair.
Budro's dancing was a feature of the
show.
The order and good-fellowship which
prevailed spoke well for the large crowd
present.
The delegation from Lafayette was the
largest on the grounds.
Sam is by far the most artistic egg-dodger
in Louisiana.
The Neuyille boys from Loreauville
scored a hit. .
As an auctioneer, Budro can't be excelled
even by Ed Curtis.
The people of Scott feel that they owe a
debt of gratitude to Mrs. Robichaux for her
very valuable assistance.
The saddle won by Sidney Harry in the
i shooting contest is of English make and was
donated by a New Orleans firm.
The transportation service was splendidly
managed.
The success of the fair showed the worth
of printer's ink judiciously employed.
With a few more fairs Scott will be ready
to build one of the handsomest churches in
South Louisiana.
. Father Laforest's letter of encouragement
was characteristic of that broad-minded
clergyman.
Good Work.
The people who travel over what
is known as the Pinhook road owe
a debt of gratitude to Messrs. C. A.
Mouton, I. N. Satterfield, the
Hamilton brothers and Police Juror
Alfred Hebert for having repaired t
that public highway which is now
in thorough condition. For years
that road has been not only an eye
sore to the public, but it has been C
a source of constant annoyance to I
a large number of people who were
compelled to drive or ride through
the ugly mud holes which were a
serious menace to the life and limbs
of the traveler. The road has been
splendidly graded and well drained
and there is no doubt that it is in
better condition than it has ever
been.
The work done by these gentle
men shows conclusively what can
be accomplished by intelligent and
conscientious labor.
A Blaze.
Iast Saturday, what might have t
been a disastrous fire had help not
been at hand, started in Mr. T. M.
Biossat's corn-crib, and in a few
minutes the building was totally
consumed by the distructive ele
mest. Luckily willing hands began
to work and the surrounding buila
ings were saved, but at a time it
seemed as if the fire would spread
and distroy a large part of the c
town. A
INFANTRYY BICYCLE CORPSE.
Complete Their 2000-Mile Ride
in Forty Days.
St. Louis, July 25.-The Twenty
fifth United States Infantry Bicycle
Corps, which reached this city last
night, completing their 2ooo-mile
ride from Fort Missoula, Mont., in
forty days, thirty-five of which were
I actually spent on the road, are en
camped at Forrest Park.
Despite the rain that tell last
night and this afternoon thousands
of people visited the troopers at the
park. During their stay here the
officers, Lieut. J. A. Moss and
Surgeon J. M. Kennedy, will be
entertained by prominent citizens,
while the troopers are the guests of
the local bicycle club, and later
will be transferred to Jefferson Bar
racks.
The Twenty-fifth United States
Infantry bicycle corps left Fort
Missoula, Mont., on June =4,
twenty-three in number, Lieut. J.
A. Moss, Surgeon J. M. Kennedy
and E. H. Boes, the official re
porters and others stationed at
Fort Missoula. During the trip
one of the men was returned to
Fort Missoula on account
of not being able to keep
up. The distance covered on
the trip was spoo miles, the aver
age per day being 52 2-3 miles.
After leaving Nebraska the average
was over 6o miles per day.
The bicycles stood the trip re
markably well, but few accidents of
a serious nature having occurred,
those that did occur being through
carelessness.
According to Lieut. Moss, the
trip was a success from a military
standpoint.
In an interview Lieut. Moss said:
"The trip has proved beyond per
adventure my contentftn that the
bicycle has a place in modern war
fare. In every kind of weather,
over all sorts of roads we averaged
fifty miles a day: At the end of
of journey we are all in good physi
cal condition.
"Seventeen tires and half a dozen
broken frames is the sum of our
damage. The practical result, of
the trip shows that an army bicycle
corps can travel twice as fast as
cavalry or intantry under any con
ditions and at one-third the cost
and effort.
"I am not sure whether we will
return on our wheels or not, but
will know as soon as orders are re
ceived from Washington."

that the people of Scott are
entitled to a church and be is anx
ious to do all in his power in their
I behalf. He does not stop to con
1 sider if the formation of a new par
ish will curtail his own territory,

actuated solely by a christain spirit.

teen days old which he took inside.

lationship with the child, came to
claim it, but Mr. Dautreuil refused

tered at a boarding house in this

became the mother of a child and

who left the unfortunate little

of this outrage are not caught and
