Royviale it)slama
From Our Regular Corrspondens.
-For the past few days the very
atmosphere ivas.heavily..laden with
that sweet aroma of sugar. The
only talk of the teeek was refinery.
When even a move of this kind is
made, it is alwayst1advisable to iet
matters take a gradual course. We
do ftot believe in speculating on
theory. The refinery agitation last
week was oine of too mature a bloom.
Conclusions was made at haste, and
at the slightest "hitch" every thing
was dropped as carelessly as a "hot
potato." Why not again renew the
subject, Mr. Capitalists ? It may
be probable, that success may follow
at the next attempt l With cotton
at its present prices, we cannot but
see misery and hard times ahead.
The majority of small planters are
more or less indebied or mortgaged.
Sugar is our only resource; our only
expedient; and unless action is taken
by our people, we fear the next
"Coxey move" will originate on this
side of the bayou.
-Quite a jolly party assembled
at Rev. Father Chabrier's residence

and there is just completed as fine
a piece of stone pav'ement as one
will see anywhere, and "tell it not

of Askelon," our own people by a
herculean effort are about to floun

have bEti~ entrenched for genera

A Contrast
Daily Iberian.
We cannot but admire the little
band of men of Broassardville com
posed of P. B. Roy; his son A. J.
Roy, M. Billaud and the firm of
Estorge & Billaud, also V. Broussard
who determined to do something
for their i~0oi aid vicinity, came
together in meeting, and then and
there in the short time of three
quarters of an hour bound themsel
ves to raise $zoo,ooo to build a
Central factory of 750 tons capacity
every 24 hours, and contracted with
C. W. George to build same. When
it is taken into consideration that
Broussardville is a very small place,
inz fact the business there is done in
four mercantile establishments
besides one drug store and one bar
room, and one Catholic Church
withoutrt a pastor (we hope the good
Bishop will see his.way clear at no
remote date to give these enterpris
ing people a priest to minister to
their spiritual wants). It is a won
derful achievement; these gentlemen
are the kind to make successful any
enterprise they may father. Here
in New Iberia we have a population
of very near 8,oo000 and we have
been trying or making bele're to try
for the last ten years to get enough
Cepi~tat to build a Central factotyp;
but up to date nothing has ever been
acconplished. Is it not about time
we were' doing soni~ethiing in the in
terests of a central factory P Can't
we induce these gentlemen to put
another $xoo,ooo in a factoky here?
What a contrast i
Broussardville-4 stores, z drug
store, s church, z bar-room, I $zoo,
cooo Central Factory.
New Iberia-several hundred
st'tres, 4 drugstores 1o saloons,
