people, at a tax not exeeedine 2 per
cent, be provided, as set forth in
the sub treasury plan of the Farm
era' Alliance, or some better system
also byhv payments in discharge 0t
its obligations for public improve
ments.
a. We dem e a nfreead unlimit
ed coinage of silver and gold at the
present legal ratio of 16 to 1.
b. We- demand that the amont
of circulating medium be speedily
increased to not less than $50, per
capita.
e. We demand a graduate : n
come tax.
d. We believe that'the money
of the country should be kept as
much as possible in the hands ot
the people, and hence we demand
that all State and national revenue
shall be limited to the necessary
expenses of the government, eco
nomically and honestly administer
ed.
e. We demand that postal sav
ings banks be established by the
government for the safe deposit of
the earnings of the people and to
facilitate exchange.
2. Transportation being a means
of exchange and public necessity,
the government should own and
operate the railroads in the inter
eat of the people.
a. The telegraph and telephoce,
like the post office system, being a
necessity for the transportation of
news, should be owned and opera
ted by the government in the in
terest of the people.
3. The land, including all the
national resources of wealth, is the
heritage of all the people, and
should not be monopolired for spec
ulative purposes, and alien owner
ship of land should be prohibited.
All laud now held by railroads and
other corporations in excess of
their actual needs, and all lands
now owned by aliens, should be re
claimed by the government and
held for actual settlers only.

Voting and Working.
For whom do you vote I
1)o you vote for somebody else
or for yourslf?
If you vote for notlher, he gets
the beuneit of it; why not vote for
yourself and get the good of it
yourself
A yote for yourself is a vote
that protects your own interest.
Is there nothing that you want?
Are work and wages satisfacto
ryl
Do you sell your products easi
ly snu for good prices
A vote for either of the old par
ties is a vote for the continuation
of present conditions.
Is it this that you want d
A Republican vote is a vote for
protectioln that does not protect.
A Democratic vote is a vote for
more Con:'res ional disgrace, more
tariff tinkering, more business dis
turbance.
A vote for either or the old par
ties is a vote for more low prices,
out of work, idleness, misery,
starvation, and also for more mil
lionairci.
The Populist candidates do not
ask you to vote for them; they are
not making any money out of you.
Vote for yourselves. Vote for
better times.
Vote for more money, more
work, more wages, more of life
and all that makes life worth hav
ing.
The Populist party is getting
there.
If not this time, then it comes
later.
We can wait as long as the rest.
Now is the time to fall in at the
head of the procession.
Would you avoid the crowd come
in at once.
It is the full-sized men who head
a new party'; the dwarfs come
later.
Cast one vote for yourself.
Drive one nail in. the coffin of
rotten politics.
lie is a better wiser, nobler man
who belongs to no party, but votes,
as he works, with an intelligent re
gaid to his own interest.
The workingman has one inter
est; the politician another.
Slaves vote for their masters;
freemen vote for themselves.
Vote not as the fool voteth; per
haps that is whpt you have been
doing.
There is yet hope for the poor
man.
The leign of the Robber-politi
cian is nearing its end, and the
people are coming to their own
again.

The Election is Over.
The Republicans will control the
next congress. The Populists made
large gains rll over the country.
But the Democrats were driven
front the field whipped. They
saved themselves where ever they
could manage the negro votes and
no where else. Hlill was defeated
by 150,000. The Populites carried
North Corolina. The Republicans
carried Tennessee, West Virginia
and Wisconsin.
The solid South is bursted sure.
The Democrats will have less than
100 members in Congress.
The Populites polled by far the
largest vote they have ever polled.
They will certainly hold the hal
lance of power in the senate. The
Democratic party got the worse
kicking it has received since the
days of Grant.-Alliance Forum.
The Populites will send 2 United
States Senators from the old faith
ful North Carolina and Ben Till
man will represent South Carolina.
The smoke of battle has cleared
away and the Populists are much
strougar than ever before. Begin
immediately to fight for 1896. Let

"What is this power? It is the !
rapacious and engorginz power of l
an ever-increasing value in the
unit. of money-that is to say, in
the dollar. When n n obligation
has-been entered into requiring the
payment of money at a future
time, this is the subtile alchemy
which, without effectingany change
in the written figures, yet enlarges
the burden of the obligation by
extracting from him who has
agreed to pay money-and all bu
siness men are in this category
more'sacrifico for each dollar than
a dollar represented at the time the
obligation was made. This pro-I
cess paralyzes industry and rele
gates to a pitiful and corroding
idleness multitudes of willing work
ers. This it accomplishes by pro
ducing an 'artificial and unnatural
fall .in the prices of property and
in the products of lalbor---a fall
not rising from the natural opera
tion of the forces of supply and
demand affecting the property and
commodities, but from a change in
the relation existing between the
supply of and the demand for
money."

'Usurv is wrong.
Preachers of the Gospel know

Usury has proved the curse and

"It is the canker worm that is
gnawing at the vitals of labor.
"'It is the device with which

"It is the ball and chain fasten
