Uatr--RWaterworks and El.eC
trio Tights Disuumssed.
About 300 persons, among whom
were many ladies, assembled at 4
Falk's . Opera-house last Monday.
night to hear discussions by local I
speakers upon the question of water
works and electric lights. The meet
ing -was not as large as was expected,
but the ,earnestness visible on all
hands and the enthusiasm which
prevailed gave unmistakable signs of
the popularity 6f the movement.
The audience was of a representa- 1
tive character, a feature which may
always be taken as a good omen for
the success of any undertaking of I
this kind.
C. O. Mouton, Esq., president of
the Business Men's Association, in ý
a brief talk explained the object of
the meeting and introduced to the I
audience the Rev. E. Forge, who
was the first speaker. The reverend
gentleman delivered a very sensible
address. He dealt at length upon a
the great necessity of protection 4
from fire. He said- that any
further procrastination in this mat
ter was little short of crimi
nal on the part of the people of this I
town. He said he would support I
the measure with all his energy and
-would use his influence toward the
success of the move just inaugurat
ed. At the conclusion of his ad
dress Father Forge handed to the
president of the B. M. A. a one
hundred-dollar-bill to be used for
the proposed plant. Short ad
dresses were then made by Messas. r
Wm. Campbell, Chas. D. Caffery a
and Julian Mouton. a
The speakers explained that pe
titions would be presented to the t
tax-payers for their signatures for t
the purpose of asking the City C
Council to call an election to see if a
the required number of people are
willing to be taxed 5-mills on the t
dollar to raise the necessary amount
to build the water-works and elec- C
tric light plant. A number of sig- s
natures were obtained before leav
ing the hall. Well-informed per
sons are of the opinion that the op
ponents to the tax will not be suffi
ciently numerous to defeat the I
measure, and it is hoped when the I
question will be thoroughly explain
ed there will not be any opposition
worth mentioning.
The exposure to all sorts and
conditions of weather that a lumber
man is called upon to endure in the I
camps often produces severe colds
which, if not promptly checked, re- I
sult in congestion or pneumonia.
Mr. J. O. Davenport, ex-manager
of the Fort Bragg Redwood Co., an
immense institution at Fort Bragg,
Cal., says they sell large quantities I
of Chamberlain's Cough Remedy at
the company's store and that he has
himself used this remedy for a se
vere cold and obtained -immediate
relief. This medicine prevents any
tendency of a cold toward pneu
monia and insures prompt recovery. I

Married. 4
Mr. Sidney J. Veazey and Miss
Rosa Martin were married Wednes- I
day evening at the Catholic church
by the Rev. Father Maltrait. The 1
popularity of the young couple had I
attracted a large number of people
who were interested spectators of
the nuptial ceremonies. At about
half-past five o'clock the bridal
party entered the church. The 4
bride, who looked unusually charm
ing in her beautiful dress, was es
corted to the altar by Dr. G. A.
Martin, her brother-in-law. Mr.
Sidney Veazey, the groom, followed
by the side of his mother, Mrs. A.
Veazey. After a few words of ad
monition, Father Maltrait perform
ed the holy rite of marriage. Mr.
and Mrs. Veazey then drove to
their cosy home in McComb's Ad
dition. They were accompanied
by members of the families and a
number of intimate friends who of
fered their earnest felicitations and
best wishes.
In a recent editorial the Salem,
Oregon, Independent says: "*Time
and again have we seen Chamber
lain's Cough Remedy tried and nev
er without the most satisfactory re
sults. Whenever we see a person
afflicted with hoarseness, with a
cough or cold, we invariably advise
them to get Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy; and when they do, they.
never regret it. It always does the
work, and does it well." For sale

Y. There seems to be a regular
1 mania for improvement in Caren

A very pretty wedding was solem
h nized on Tuesday Feb. 4, at 4:30 p. J
f m. at St. Peter's Catholic church.
Mr. S. D. A rcenaux and Miss Anais
Bernard were united in the holy
bonds of matrimony by Father La
forest. The bride was most charm
r ingly arrayed in white. satin,
f trimmed with lace and orange blos
soms, the ample veil of tulle grace
s fully arranged upon the bride's dark
tress and falling to the end of the
train. The two pretty little atten
f dants dressed appropriately to grace
the happy occasion were Miss Lil
lian Guilbeau and Miss Pearl Guid
ry, who kept their places by the r
bridal couple during the ceremony.
Rev. Father Girard, of Montreal,
i addressed the young couple a few
eloquent words upon the grandeur
and the solemnity of the true Chris
tian marriage. During the day a
fine dinner was served at the resi
dence of the bride's mother to rela- j
s tives a few intimate friends, in true
t hospitable Creole style. After the
ceremony, a reception was held by
Mr. and Mrs. Arcenaux to their
Sumerons friends. Mr. and Mrs.
Arcenaux will be residents of our
town and we take this occasion to
welcome them in our midst, and to
wish them a felicitous journey'
through a long married life. F
We deem it the duty of all public
spirited citizens to ally themselves
with the "Good Roads League," or
at least to give such encouragement
as lies in their power. Should the
plan of the association meet with
the support it deserves, there can
be no doubt that we will gradually
have snch roads as we may be ploud F
of, and prove a source of general
satisfaction.

Mr. Henry Breaux will in a day
or two ship a lot of eighteen oak
Slogs to a certain place in France.
This is the beginning of what may ,
