C ONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTI ON.
Opposition to All Candidates who Op.
pose a New Organic Law.
Ricri.AXD PARiss, LA., Feb. 8, 1879
To tihe Editor or the Democrat :
I protest against tihe election of any
man as a delegate for the constitutio
nal convention who was opposerd to
the calling of that convention. It is
notorious everywhere that a great op
position was waged to having any
new constitution for Louisiana by a
great many politicians, and the peo
ple had a Iard struggle to defeat
them. Taking it for granted that all
tihese politicians were honest and sin
cere in their course-yet I will ask
tihe people everywhere if they can
trust the judgment and isdom of
those men enough to allow them to
make their new constitution ? I hold
that no man is fit to make a new con
stitution for Louisiana who was satis
Bed to put up with and keep the old
Radical outrage, no nmtter how it
might be patched. And how unjust
and ungrateful it is to give the go
by to the faithful men who had the
brains to uoderstand Louisiana's
I great necessity when the crisis was
opoo her, and the courage to contend
for her redemption then, and to take
up the other moea, who fought so bard
or keep her under time bayonet con
stitution. Whoever had so little
ability to estimate tihe merits of a
constitution as to be satisfied with
that old fraud iq not good enoughi
judge of constitutions to make one for
me. We have plenty of able and bon
Iorable men in this Twenty-Third
Senatorial District to represent the
people; men who stood by us when
the battle was being fought for our
rights. It is unnecessary to mention
the names of Capt. G. W. MceCranie,
I Capt. R. G. Cobb, Capt. H. F. Vick
ers, Jodge M. J. Liddell,, Major P.
H. Teler, Capt. A. B. Cooper, John
A. IHemiet, Esq., Capt. Franklin Garb
rett, Judg A. L Slack, Thomas A.
. Garrett, q., A. A. Guny, Esq. F.
G. Hudson, E., Judge Duncan Bole,
Judge H. W. Campbell, H. N. Potts,
Esq, Judge R. D. Bridgaer Capt. E.
· E. Kidd and Thomas J. Mangam,
al l of whom are eminently quap 8ed
for the offce of delegate to the con=
vention, and struggled manfully to
secure as a new canstitution. Yet
i Mr. Manham, editor of the Richland
Beacon, advocated in his last paper
the seleetioo of Judge R. W. Richard
son, of Monroe, as the senatorial del
Segates from this district, when it is
* well known that he and State Sea
tort F. P. Stubbs, Col. Robert Richard
Sson, Capt. W. W. Farmer and Capt.
S. D. McEnery, of Oasehita, and
Capt. H. P. Wells, of this parish,
were the prominent men ino North
.Loouisiana who opposed the constitu
ional convrention, and actually car
ried Onaciity parish against it. Tmhe
wonder on the showing, is, tbhat Mr.
Mangham has not advocated tihe se
ledtio of Capt. W. W. Farmer
for the conventioa, who is will
be remembered, made himself
i particularly conaspicuous In opposi
tion to the convention, by publishing
SsonI letters attacking Mr. Morgan
I and Ihis paper- but I suppose he
Sthinks that wou(d be laying is on too
thick, particularly as Capt. Farmer
has been con8fed to his bed, or roem,
, by cnsumption since last summer.
m But if Mr. Maugham is seeking an
SI ati-conventionlst, either of the geo
I tlemen above named was more con
spicuous than Judge Richardson, and
I he ought to take the most active of
- them. Why not take Senator Stabba t
Bus away with this plan of selecting
p men to do a thinu who were opposed
i to th thing being done. Give time
I psople s man nasCapt E.tE Kdd
; of Jackaso parish, wimo was defeated
for the amadeinalo for State Senator
f becouse he was a esnventionist; give
- 5s suck a man as Capt. 1. 0. Cobb,
of Monroe, wh. stood up unfalterlig
a l o ventiOh, and has always
5 been th unfaltering enemy of all
I rings sad Badicals, even in time height
- of their rower; give us men who
r have always sympathized with the
P Demoraney or ltolsiana, and who
r willin time convention relieve the
i peopl, of their intolerable burdens.
