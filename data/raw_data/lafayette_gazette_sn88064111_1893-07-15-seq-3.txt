A number-of our young people
were looking forward with pleasant
anticipation to the "social" ten
tered by our esteemed citizen Mr.
George E. Brown, in honor of Mr.
Melchior, on Saturday the 8th inst.
It was undoubledly the most com
plete, the most enjoyable home en
entertainment that has ever taken
place in our town. The services of
the Carencro string band were se
cured for the occasion. The large
warehouse in the rear of Mr.
Brown's store, was devoted to the
use of the merry dancers. This
room was tastefully decorated, with
evergreens, and flowers. At one
end, was suspended a large mirror
on the face of which appeared the
words "Aint I pretty" and one
could easily answer the question
when admiring the reflection of the
young ladies as they approached to
read the query.
In the open air, under large
shade trees, long tables placed at
right angles were provided for the
suplper. It was truly-a feast, that
was fully enjoyed by a party of
very happy people. Everything
that refined taste could suggest and
money procure was jprovided for
the guests. . It was aronlnd this fes
tive board that the artistic hand of
the decorator was plainly shown.
To the overhangi ig branches of the
trees were attached beautiful Japa
nese lanterns. and immediately over
the centre of the table hung at short
intervals were a number of pretty
baskets filled with flswers. On top
of the reservoir near the end of the
gallery, was arranged an immense
pyramid of moss, evergreens and
vari-colored roses, with a bae of
Ieautifully festooned cloth and
hangings, forming one of the pret
tiest pieces of decorative work,
your correspondent has ever seen.
T'roasts complimentary to Mr. Miet
chior, the ladies and Mr. Brown
were offered by Mr. L. G. Stelly,
IDr. J. 1'. Francez antd I'rof. Tap-.
pissier, to which unanimuous allppro
val was shown with raised glasses of
sparkling champagne.
A very interesting feature, of this
happy occasion, was the entry of a
"phantom party" and while their
costume was awe-inspiring and se
vere to the extreme, it was not long
before the balance of the party
realized that some pharitoms are a
very jolly, happy set of companions
to have around.
Mr. H. C. Ludlow and L. G.
Stelly were the humorists of the oc
casion, causing laughter and much
pleasure, with their wit and antics.
The following ladies and gentle
men were among die guests: Misses
A. Breaux, Lucic Jones, Emma
Jones, Virginia and Lizzie Smith of
Grand Coteau, Estelle Gerac of
