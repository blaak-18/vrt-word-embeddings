being daily shipped to the refineries
from Lombard's switch.
We understand the business of
the railroad from Broussardville
west to, and including Lake
Charles is so great that the freight
trains are kept moving quite lively.
The Governor is somewhat slow
in filling the vacancy existing in the
city council. The Gazette fervently
hopes that the appointee will be a
man with the back bone of a Don

Mr. Ned Mouton.
From the way customers are flock
ing to the store of Messrs. Mouton
& Salles, we advise them to change
the name of the place to the "*bee

with the throngs going in and out.
Would it not be a good idea for
the Business Men's Association to
run an excursion, say, from
Washington to the Salt Mines, the
profits accruing to go the High
School Fund. A couple of hun
dred dollars, we believe, could be
realized.
Sheriff Ike Broussard left last
Sunday for Baton Rouge with a
batch of prisoners for the peniten
tiary. He had, also, in charge the
unforunate Mrs. Lacobie, who is
being taken to the lunatic asylum at
Jackson.

The Gazette is pleased to note that
Sheriff I. A. Broussard has made
a final settlement with the auditor

for the year 1892, and has also set
tled for the third quarter of 1893.

As soon as the question of the

The regulationsof the railroad lim
iting the time to load cars to 24 hours
including the night, which in reality
amounts to about ten working hours,
works a hardship on the small
planters who are thus forced to go
to more expenses that they can well
afford to comply with the order.
That enterprising merchant, Mr.
B. Falk, comes to the front in this
issue with an invitation to the pub
lic to visit his store, and look over
the splendid lots of new goods that
he has just bought from firms need

some big bargains, and of which he
intends to give his customers the.

Mr. H. L. Monnier has had an

That popular merchant, Mr.
Leon' Plonsky, has returned from
New Orleams, where he purchased
for spot cash, a large stock. These
goods, he claims, were bought at
inside figures, and he will be in a
position to give buyers better and
bigger bargains than ever. If you
need anything its his line he will be
pleased to see you.
The Gazette calls attention to the
card, in another part of this issue,
of Mr. Felix Manade. His store is
so well known, and his stock always
of the best, that it is almost super
fluous to mention the fact. But Mr.
Manade wants the readers of The
Gazette to know that his card is
a standing invitation to call on him
-his prices will do the rest.
The Gazette has received the
prospectus announcing the early
publication of a newspaper at the
town of Cheneyville which will be
called the "Theoda Menora." We
noticed that our friend, M. S. Alex
ander is the business manager, and
if energy and hustling will make the
paper a success, why, it will get
there with both feet. This enter
prise has The Gazette's best wishes
for a prosperous future.
Messrs. Jos. Plonsky & Son, hav

The Gazette hopes that these gen

tablish a mercantile business, in
which the senior of the firm has
been engaged for a long number of
year.s, with fair success, until over
come by the late stringency in the
money market, making impossible
for them to make any collections.
Fashion has decreed that the
"plainer and more unostenatious a
wedding card, the more becoming
and appropriate it will be." Mrs.
Sherwood notes that "engraved
script on pure white wove," fulfills
to the letter the requirements. But
when the party cannot go the ex
pense, a way that conforms strictly
to the rules of etiquette is found in
the use of copper plate script on
white wove, and the printing should
be only in black ink. To those
who may desire any of the latter
kind, The Gazette would be pleased
to quote prices.
Mr. Wm. Clegg showed us some
boxes of fine linen papetries, and
envelopes to match. We feel con
vinced that they are the finest goods
i- town; and sold at very moderate
prices. This gentleman has a full
line of stationery that he claims to
sell cheaper than any other store in
town. He buys direct from the
factory, is the reason. Some days
since a drummer offered him some
goods at a certain price, Mr. Clegg
knocked the drummer silly by offer
ing to sell him the same goods in
his store cheaper than the drum
mer offered them at.
Having been delegated by the
School Board to go to Cheneyville

Mouton, having complied with his

A special to the Times-Democrat
from this town under date of the
24th instant, says: ",Last night at
9 o'clock the rice stack in one of
the rice fields of E. Van Klickstein,
(The Gazette thinks Mr. A. von
Kalckstein is meant) on the Long
plantation, was set on fire. It was
almost immediately discovered,
which enabled Mr. Klickstein to
save the biggest portion, but not
before several stacks, containing
about z5o barrels of fine Honduras
rice, were destroyed. There is no
doubt but that it was the work of
an incendiary, as the stacks were
put up early last week; and nobody
was around or near there at work
since. A reward will be offered for
facts sufficient to convict the guilty
party."
A Splendid Appointment.
The Governor has appointed Mr.
Alfred Hebert a member of our
parish Police Jury from the third
ward to fill the vacancy caused by
A ,e geaea al opinion is that the
Governor could not have made a
better selection. Mr. Hebert is one
of the most energetic and enter
prising citizens in the parish of La
fayette. That he will be a valuable
member in that body goes without
saying. The Gazette congratulates
the Governor in this wise appoint
ment. Mr. Hebert, The Gazette

Superintendent D- S. Gaster yes
terday received a letter from Mr.
H. L. Monnier, of Lafayette, La.,
in which he expresses the belief that
the man, B. Leslie, who was arrest
ed here a few days ago on the
charge of obtaining goods by false
pretences, was the same as the man
who got Mrs. Monnier, on October
7, to pay him money. The man re
presented himself as an agent for
the New York Fashion Company,
and claimed to be from Houston,
Texas, giving the number 49 as his
letter box. The man was described
as being small of stature, with dark
complexion, black hair and mus
tache. He had a strange way of
twisting his face. Mr. Monnier
said if these two men were the same
he would come to New Orleans in a
few days.
Royville Items.
From Our Regular Correspondent.
A grand balloon ascension was
the attraction last Saturday, and
people from all parts of this section
witnessed this successful and daring
exhibition. Prof. Nelson made the
ascent, and proved himself to be a
fearless and experienced aeronaut.
The performance was highly enjoyed
by the spectators, a great many of
whom had never before seen a bal
loon. Your correspondent was in
formed that parties residing at least
35 miles from Royville came to see
to use their own words-" ce fait ex
traordinaire."
-'T'he dry spell we are now hav
ing is being badly felt. Stock is
suffering ; grass is dying; and, in
many parts of the ward, wells are
dry. By having more competition
amongst wind mills manufacturers,
we .are positive prices would go
down, enabling our farmers to have
wind mills erected on their farms.
But, with the high existing prices,
our small planters find it utterly im
possible to employ this easy and
convenient way of having all the
water needed for cooking and stock
purposes. None deserve more help
and sympathy then the farmer, and
for this reason, all the aid possible
should be accorded him.
-Messrs. Eastin and Pointboeuf,
of Lafayette, have taken the con
tract for painting Dr. Scranton's
residence. These gentlemen are
fine workmen, and Dr. Scranton
was very fortunate in securing their
services.
-We were informed that Royville
is shortly to lose one of her promi
nent citizens. Mr. T. H. Theriot,
an old and esteemed resident of this
town, intend shortly to make Ab
beville his future. Although sorry
to see Mr. Theriot and family depart
we cannot but wish him unbound
ed success in his future undertakings
and trust that his new field of labor
will have justification in leaving
Royville.
-Hon. H. Theall, Mayor of
Royville, left for the Crescent City
Sunday. Mr. Theall will be absent
a few days attending to business.
-Miss Maud Young, and broth
er, Clifton, visited Lafayette the
past week.
-Major Odillon Blanchet was on
the sick list Thursday.
-Mrs. Ledet, of Lafourche par
ish, was a guest of her cousin's fam
ily, last Friday.
-What about the wedding last
Wednesday ?
-Royvillians highly appreciate
the deep interest that their sister
town, Carencro, take in them, and
we return our most sincere thanks
to Bro. "Totidem Verbis" for the
success wished us. We are more
than happy to hear that Breaux
Bridge and Carencro are shortly to
be connected by railway, and that
the latter town succeeded in secur
ing the prize, so anxiously wished
for by both New Iberia and Lafa
