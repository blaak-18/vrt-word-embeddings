m. present system of leasindg convicts.
o Of all the evils that should receive
the 'attention of our law'sa~akers we
do not know of any more harmful to
the intere'of the State and society.
In the first place, the treatmeg .of
convicts by leslsees- is often very
eruel and inhuman and will continue
Sto be so as long as it is a matter of
dollars and cents to men who care
sic nothing for the treatment of these
unfortunate people, but whose sole
object is to make all the money they
can out of the sweat of 'The misera
ble wretches who are so unfortunate
nd as to be placed under their control.
ple Aside from the question of humanity,
and taking a cold business view of
the matter, would it not be more
Y profitable to the State to work the
levees with the labor of its convicts,
than to pay large sums of money to
.e contractors to whom these same
convicts are leased for a very small
consideration.
The Legislature of Mississippi is
presently engaged in making provi
S sion to establish a farm where the
convicts of that State will be put to
s work. The State has purchased
5000ooo acres of land and the prison
buildings, workshops, etc., will be
located there. Those able to work
id will be employed in agriculture, or
in in the shops which will manufacture
Id the clothing, shoes, agricultural im
Ie plements, wagons and all other
articles necessary to run the farm.
it One of the chief objections against
r- utilizing the labor of convicts is the
demoralizing effect it has on free
labor. The proposition offered by
d the Mississippi solons will, to a great
extent, overcome this difficulty.
e Since convicts can not be main
tained in idleness and must be made
to earn their living, otherwise the
taxpayers will have to pay for it,
this appears to us the wisest plan.
Let our Legislators watch the experi
r ent in Mississippi thereby gaining
some valuable information on a sub
ject, that will, in all probability, oc
cupy their attention at the next
e meeting of the General Assembly.
The Value of Victims of Lynch:i
Law.
New Orleans Picayune.
The recent verdicts for damages;
rendered agains the City of New
a Orleans in the cases of the Italians ,
e who were lynched in the Parish e
Prison in this city, have attracted
considcrable attention throughout.
the country, not only because of the s
extraordinary notoriety of the event,
but because it furnishes an interesting
memorandum of the valuations put
upon lynching generally.
The surviving friends of the dead
i Italians have been granted by New
Orleans juries damages to the
amount of $5000 in each case, save
one, when $4000 was allowed. I
These facts are presented in contrast t
with the damages allowed by a
Kansas jury for a negro who was s
lynched at Abilene, in that state.
The Kansas jury assessed the g
damages at $2.
In the light of the fact that J
Kansas is the state in which
the war for the freeing of i
the negroes was virtually started, r,
and in which John Brown u
the martyr in the cause of the black ,
man, earned his apostolate and was i
subsequently defied, it does seem ti
that $2 is a pitiful sum to assess as
damages against a Kansas commu
nity that turned out and lynched a
negro. In comparison the Louisia- j
na verdicts are instructive. The Sa
vannah News, commenting on the N
incident declares that "of all the
States in the Union abstract justice
for the blacks obtained most in Kan- A
sas. Yet we have a Kansas jury re
turning a $z'verdict for the lynching A
of a negro Fred Douglas, not long
ago, remarked that 'in the South a
dead nigger is a joke.' In Kansas,
it seems, a 'dead nigger' is not even
funny; after they have hung him
they merely pay $a for him and call th
it square." J
The solution of the matter is that fc
in Kansas the chief value of the ne- bi
gro is that he could, when alive, be ly
made an important political factor.
Dead, he comes high at $2. I

re
ae Rev. Houston Armstrong.
s, The following sketch of the Rev.
to Houston Armstrong was published
°e in the Times-Democrat of Jan. 2o.
ll Mr. Armstrong has lived in Lafa
i yette where he was pastor of the
Methodist church:
The Rev. Houston Armstrong, of Frank
le lin, St. Mary parish, La., is a Kentuckian by
to birth, and also grew to- manhood in that
d State. When the war broke out he was at
tending Cumberland College, where he
gained a desire for deeper research and
e study. Filled with an intense love for the
k South, he first joined the Ninth Mississippi
r of Infantry, and a short while after the"
re Tenth Mississippi. He was captured at the
battle of Stone river, Tenn., and imprisoned
at St. Louis, Mo. The war record of Mr.
Armstrong is filled with interest, and his
1- comrades in arms can bear testimony to .his
St valor and love for the cause he endeavored
to uphold.
After the war he engaged in teaching,
proving himself as one capable of imparting
Y knowledge to the young. As a teacher he
it was honored and looked upon aa a man
. whose whole desire was to benefit mankind.
In the fall of 1875 he entered the ministry of
e the Little R )ck Conference, and traveled in
the State of Arkansas. By reason of his love
`e and interest, which he showed the children
I, and young people, at the different places
where he served, and being alive to every
good cause which deserved his attention, he
became well known over the State, and
every charge hailed him with delight.
In ISS7 he was transferred to the Louisia
na Conference. His first w Jk was among
t the people of Delhi, remaining there three
years. iHe wa' next sent to Bastrop, where
he served but one year. After accouplis ing
much so gd in the last named locality he was
stationedtA at Lafayette, La., for two years.
By action of the bishop in Deenemher, i$03,
She was sent to serve the deligh.fu.l appuoi:- '
ment in Franklin, La.. wvihere hc succeeis
the Rev. J. B. Cassity. Mr. Ar:stro,ng h'r s
S already got his work in g,:i shr.pe, an.t
h everythintg points to a delightful year to bh h
pastor and people. In the pulpit Mr. Ar:u- 't
t strong presents the truths as they are foind
in the WordI of Godi in such wanr.er that the C
C smallest child in the congregation can aplre- ,,
ielate the holly thoughts he delivers to then. i.
Personally, MIr. Armstrong is a retiring,
t modest gentleman, with but one aim ihn view;
he labors for the wll-being an.l geo-i of t'e'
people, whoappreeiate his effo.rts to elevate
man to a higher and better life.
"'lIow About The Weather?'" Fa
"The WVeekly Caurie:r-J ra:nal, pnliiish d! at ,.
Louisville, Iy., delights in keeping its sub- t:
scribrrs guessing. In a:dition to being the
greatest )nemstcratii e newrpaper published, it
has been a pio:neer in enterprise:s that req:ire
thought and figuring on the part of its sub
scribers. The Weeklv's estimating contest
on the election in iSe2, by which t.4,4» in
gold coin were distributed among forty-five
guessers, is a sample of this. The latest
guessing offer of this paper is on the weather
-that one subject on which we all consider
ourseives prophets. T'ie Weekly Courier- er
Journal proposes to give Si,ooo in -ash to its se
subscrilbers who can name the coldest day in
the month of February, 1804, at l.ouisville,
Ky., and guess cloies, to the lowest tempe
rature on this day. The contest closes Jan
uary 31, 1894. Every new subscrioer who
sends Sr can make one guess; and every old I
subscriber who renews, sending St, can
guess. Send for a sample copy of the paper
for full particulars. Write at once, as the /
time is short.
