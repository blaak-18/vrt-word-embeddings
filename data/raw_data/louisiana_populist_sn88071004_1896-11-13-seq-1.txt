Free coinage of silver is only one
step in the direction of currency re

If a gold basis will give us good times
why don't we have them now, under
the "existing gold standard"?
If gold should be discovered in un
limited quantities what would become
of the existing gold standard?
The threat which the banks made to
precipitate a panic has resulted in
people drawing out their money.
Free silver is the strategic point
around which the battle for the con
trol of the currency is being fought.
The issue is money against men, and
no amount of tariff oratory can divert
the minds of the people from the real
issue.
We may be "ignorant, vicious and
wrong-headed," as the gold-bugs
charge-but merely calling us so does
not prove it so.
Populists believe in a money redeem- t
able in corn wheat, cotton, hogs, and
all other products of labor, as well as
gold and silver.
Primary money means redemption
money, redemption money means coin
to redeem with, and coin to redeem
with means bonds with which to pur- i
chase it. o

The question is not so much as to
what kind of a dollar the worki'.;man
will be paid in, as it is whether he will ti
have the opportunity to earn any kind
of a dollar or not.
If the banks can pay their depositors
in 60-cent dollars in the event of free o
coinage of silver, why should they lose k
any sleep over the privilege of doing it? ,
Banks are not built that way.

THE FACTORY GIRL.
BY HELEN FORREST GRAY CS.
There was no sort of doubt but that
Middlefield had grown sand w is thriv
ing at an amazing rate since the fac
tories had been set up.
In old times it was wont to be a
sleepy, stupid sort of a pla- ., with
a wide blue river men adering
tirough its midst, a church an d three
or four stores; now it was a flourish
ing young village, with every probc
bility of expanding into a cit.r.
And of all the boarding-houses that
had sprung up, as if by magie within
its limits, chiefly for accomi sod ation
of the factory girls, Mrs. iipworthl
claimed that hers was the genteelest.
"We have a waitress at tablle," said
Mrs. Nipworth, loftily, "el man nap
kins twice a week, and ice cream, at
dessert, of a Sunday; and if any other
lady in Middlefield can say as much,
why I should be pleased to hear it,
that's all I"
Claire Dayton had come to Middle
field to work in the factories. The
Daytons had been well-to-do people
once, but Mr. Dayton had speculate-l.
lost his fortune, sad wilted out of the
world like a dandelion that has brien
set down by the mower's sickle.
Mrs. Dayton, who had been brorsght
up to do nothing bet sit in an easy
chair and attitudinims, looked help
lessly over the heads of her five chil
dren, and wondered what was to be
done.
"Mamma," said Claire, "'l)l tell
you. Will shall go into Mr. Tenier's
olne at a dollar a week. It isn't
much, but it's bettea .$haLt.Jothing.
Bessie san learn the milinery business
at Madame Pompni's. She will at
least get her board there, and perhaps
acquire some neeful ideas into the bar
gain. Kate and Fanny are too small
to be of any use. They must remain
at home with you."
"And you?" said Mrs Dayton, her
dim blue eyes opening wide in aston
ishment at Claire's unusual executive
ability.
"I will go into one of the Middle
aeld factories," sid Claire, resolute
"But what do you know of the kind
of work required to be done in facto
rise?"
' I ean learn, mamma."
'Oh, dear-oh, dear!" said Mrs.
Dayton. "I wish we were all dead
sad buried l"
"But while we are live,"raid Claire,
with a smile, "we must be doing some
thing to provide ourselves with food
and clothing."
So Claire Dayton came to Middle
aed and engaged the last vacat room
in Mrs Nipworth's establishment
Mr, Carstair the young foreman in
the lrsakli Factory, boarded there,
dto, sad when bArs'd he eame in to tea,
ad at down opposite Claire Dayton,
he thoaght her the loveliest eretore
he ever had met in his life.
*Ia't she beuatiful?" said hbe to his
ie., a tall, frigid spister,' who pre
id ever the Middledeld breah of a
pies-,~tter establishaet.

"We do not know that," observed
the lady, acidly.
Somehow, Claire Dayton was not
popular in the house. She was polite
and courteous to ail, but she formed
no intimacies.
"Stuck up!" Rhoda Miller called
her. "Airy and conceited," Miss
Upjohn said.
No one was really kind to her but
Mr. Carstairs, and the fact of his
chivalrous kindness and evident ad
miration seemed still further to ent
bitter the other eleven young lady
boarders toward its object.
"I really don't see what Mr. Car
stairs can fancy in her," said Maria
Upjohn.
"Gentlemen always do fancy these
red-haired, light-complexioned girls,"
said Miss Miller, who was a brunette,
and had long entertained views upon
the young foreman of the Franklin
Factory.
And Miss Carstairs, who disap
proved, on principle, of her brother
settling in life (bachelor brothers are
more convenient to single sisters), de
preciated Miss Dayton on all occa
sions.
Of all Claire's beauties, her rich
red-gold hair filled Hngh Carstairs
with the greatest admiration.
"It's the loveliest I ever saw in my
life," said he. "It's just the shade of
a picture I once saw in the Academy
of Fine Arts, in Philadelphia."
"My hair-dreseer can get the color
for you at fifty cents a bottle," re
marked Miss Lavinia Carstairs, with
acrimony.
"Nonsensel" saidh.er brother.
"Do you actually suppose it's her
own?" satirically demanded the
lady.
"Do I suppose the light in her eye
and the tone of her voice are her
own?" spiritedly retorted the young
foreman.
Mis COastairs made no reply, she
merely raised her eyebrows and
sniffed.
That selfsame afternoon she called
her brother down into the back yard
-a dreary little wilderness of lilac
bushes, some late shrubs and sickly
geranium plants-where the semi
weekly wash of napkins and table
cloths was flapping on the line, and a
lachrymose dog, chained to his ken
nell, kept up a perpetual whine,
"Hugh," said she, "come here. I
want to speak to you. "
"What is it?" said Mr. Carstairs,
impatiently.
"Look there l" said Mis Lavinia,
pointing one hooked finger to the
third-story easement.
"Well, I'm looking."
"Do you see that window with the
muslin curtain blowing in the breeze?"
"Yes."
"That is Miss Dayton's window.
And do you me that thing hanging
out of it by a string?"
"It looks like a sec lp," suggested
Hugh.
"It's a switch" said Lavinia.
"A what?"
"A switch. False hair."
"Impossiblel" cried the young
ran.
"Well, you've the evidence of your
own senses," said Miss Carstairs, not
without a spice of triumph in her
tone and manner. "And now what do
you think about your piece of perfoo
tion?"
"I think," said Hugh Osretairs,
slowly. "that I cannot tolerate or
abide falsity in any of its shapes; and
I am more disappointed thsa I can
tell."
I alwnays knew she wasn't real,"
aiad Miss Lvinia, with a viesions re
' Bat for all that," added Orstais,
setting his firm white teeth together.
"I love Miss Dayton, and I shall Lask
hr to become my wife."
"What!" shrieked Miss artair.
"Tour wife? And with a switch?"
"With a aswiteh, and with a hump
bak, and with a set of false teeth,
Â·ad with smything uand everything else
on the fee of the Ilobe," said Hugh
And be' wued ameT huam Wh
Lavinia and the flaplping damasks and
the low-spirited dlog.
He asked Olarie Dayton to marry
him that very afternoon, when he met
her on the common, returning from
his day's work.
"I am only a foreman in the Fran
klin Factory," said he, "but I mean to
Mtaud higher before I die. I am earn
ing a good income, and dare any man
living to breathe a word against my
character or habit-. Andi, .iss Day
ton, I love you truly and entirely, and
I'll do my best to make you a good
husband if you will be my wife."
And Claire answered softly:
"I will."
Of course there was no lack of gos
sip and comnment when the news trans
pired in Mrs. Nipworth's boarding
house.
"'A sly puss," said Miss Miller.
"I pity him!" said Miss Jennings.
"A girl must be doeperately in
want of a husband to take him !" said
Miss Upjohn, who had all bit pro
posed to Mr. Carstairs.
But little oared Hugh and Claire
for all this effervescence of malice.
They were happy. Yet once or twice
Hugh found his glance wandering
through the lustrous auburn cables of
Claire's long hair, and wishing it was
all real.
But the next day Claire brought
him a box.
"Will you be so good as to take
this to the express office for me,
Hugh?" said she. "It is a parcel I
am sending to my aunt in Oregon."
"It's a peculiar shaped box," said
Hugh.
"Oh," said Claire, "it's a switch!"
Hugh's face cleared up.
"Was it hanging outof your window
on Tuesday?" he said breathlessly.
"How did you know?" said Claire.
"Yes, it was. I thought it smelled
rather musty, so I put it out to air."
"If I didn't think it was yours I"
"Mine!" cried Claire, a little dis
dainfully.
And she pulled out half a dosea
pins and down tumbled a glistening
eascade of auburn hair almost to her
feet.
"There I" said she. "Does that look
like a switch?"
And Mise Lavinia,chanoing to enter
just then, was an unwilling witness of
Hugh's triumph.
"Beauty is only skin deep," sighed
she, "and it is sinful to be vain l"
And so vanished the last suspicion
of a thorn out of Hugh Osrstairs'
roses--- turday Night
Water Pipes to Hold Convicts.
A new idea in jail construction has
recently been successfully tested in
Boston. In brief the scheme is to
constroot the cells of hollow pipes and
fill them with water. When a pipe is
severed the water escapes, and by a
system of registers in the office of the
jail the fact is made known as well as
the particular cell where the pipes
have been attacked.
No attempt is made to have the
pipes partieularly hard. Common
gas pipe is as good as any and will
answer every purpose. The water is
kept under a high pressure so that it
will be sure to give the alarm when
the pipe is severed.
Under the usual system of jail con.
struction it is aimed to make the bars
so hard that saws will not afleot them;
or at best, so hard that cutting would
be a slow process. But convicts in
jails are as clever us men who oon
struct jail cell, and methods have
been discovered for taking the tem
per out of the hardest steel. Nitrio
acid will do it, and so will common
candle. If the flame of the latter te
kept for several days close against a
bar of chilled steel it will be made eo
soft that a common steel w will cut
it. Solid steel plates have been eaten
with acids and escape made possible.
The filling of hollow pipes with water
seems to be a good idea.

CRATER LAKE.
The Deepest Body of Fresh Water
in America.
Some Curious Facts About This
Oregon Wonder.
Crater Lake, in Oregon, is the
deepest body of frebh water in Amer
ice. Only one lake in the world is
deeper, namely, Baikal, which exceeds
it in depth by about 400 feet. Until
recently it was asserted that Crater
Lake was bottomless, but soundings
have proved that its greatest depth is
2,000 feet. It is five miles in diam
eter, nearly circular, and occupies the
crater of an extinct volcano.
No fish have ever been known to ex
ist in Crater Lake. Not long ago a
request that it be stocked with trout
was sent to Washington by the Maza
mas, who are a club of mountain
climbers, having headquarters at
Portland. Mazama is the Indian name
for mountain goat. The climbers are
anxious to angle in the extinct crater,
and the government experts are going
to find out whether or not such a
thing is practicable. It is easy enough
to put trout into the water, but that
would be of no use unless there is
food for them there. Trials will be
made by an expedition, for the pur
pose of ascertaining how much food
there is and whether or not it is of a
kind suitable for speckled beauties to
browse upon.
This will be accomplished by tow
ing small nets of gauze along the sur
face of the water. The water will
fow through the gauze, whieh will
catch all the animalcula that come in
its way. The quantity of the latter
secured in a given number of minutes
or hours will be an aoeurate measure
of the amount of fish food present.
They will be bottled and prenrved in
formaline for subsequent examination
by a specialist who will determine the
species represented. Chiefly they
will be little shrimps and other small
erastaoeans,and there will be some in
sects also. It will be necessary to
make the towings at different hours of
the d}.y, because some crustaceans
swim near the surface only in the
morning, others at midday, and others
yet in the evening. Shady areas as
well as sunny ones must be sought for
various species.
A most interesting series of experi.
ments will be made for the purpose
of asertaining the temperature of the
water at various depths. No temper
ature observations have ever been
taken in fresh water nearly so far
down. With this end in view, an
equipment of self-registering ther
mometers and supplementary appar
atus will be taken and will be let
down by means of sounding lines.
There are very few places in the en
tire lake where the depth is less than
1,600 feet, though it shoals off some
what in the southwest part One line
of soundings registered over 1,900
feet for a distance of two miles. These
depths are unapproaohed by any other
lake in the western hemisphere.
No wonder, then, that Crater Lake
was supposed to be bottomless. How
ever the truth is that all lakes over
150 feet deep possess a similar repn
tation. Any body of water that is
deeper than the length of the longest
feeling line is sure to lack a bottom in
the popular belief. A first-rate ex
ample of this sort of delusion is af
forded. by Payette Lake in Idaho. It
was formerly imagined to be bottom
less, and later its depth was odiciaily
stated to be 2,600 feet Recent in
veetigation proves that its greatest
depth is 306 feet. There are no data
on whioh to bsea gues as to the
bottom temperature of Crater Lake,
but the supposition is that it will be
very little above freezing. The tem
perature of the ooean depths remains
at about forty degrees Fahrenheit all
the year round, even in the tropics.
Neverthelte, some volcanic heat may
yet remain to warm the waters of
Crater Lake.--St. Louis Globe-Demo

Amslag Ipisede . Churek.
The Chureh Times says that on a

the choir was startled during the sing

llow the Lemon Is Cored.
All lemon-curing structures have
either double walls filled between with
sawdust-hke icehouses-or heavy,
thick walls of cement, and are dark
within, with abundance of cool air
constantly circuil:ting about the fruit.
There are veutilators in the floor and
through the roof, and nearly every
grower has some patent or device of
his own for creating a draft of air in
the curing-houses. When the fruit
has been taken to the curing-houses,
it is gone over more carefully, and
four grades are selected, varying from
the smooth-skinned, unblemished and
perfect-sized fruit down to that which
his rough, thick skin and is blem
ished. The lemons are washed and
soft brushes remove any weather
stains. Then, when they are dried,
they are placed with care in airtight
and padded boxes, so as to "sweat"
for a few days. When that process is
over they are taken out, dried by
hand, and with careful handling are
placed on trays a yard wide, two
inches deep and having bottoms of
slats so as to permit easy circulation
of air. These trays are slid into great
racks in the cellars of the curing
house, where a constant temperature
of 60 degrees and darkness are main
tained. Several packing-houses in San
Diego County, California, will each
accommodate 25,000 boxes at once.
In three or four weeks the fruit has
turned yellow, and is ready for pack
ing for market. But every other day
in the curing period the successful
grower goes over all his lemons, and
by the light of a lamp sees that each
particular one is curing so that it re
tains its citric oil, that its skin is soft
and pliable, and that it is hard and
firm, for such properties make lemons
the best "keepers" until they get to
the oonsumer,weeks or months hence.
All fruit that shows the least signs of
decay is east saide at once. It is com
paratively easy to grow and cure lem
one that may be rushed to market as
soon as the curing prooess is finished,
but only patience and experience curs
a lemon so that it may be harvested
in January and kept first-olas and
shipped to market in July or August,

Treading Water With Aid of a ilte.
Richard M. Augustin of Winona.,
Minn., a professor in the public
schools of that city, is stopping at
Willard's. "Kite-flying is becoming
all the rage in Winona," said he.
"Willard Matthews, one of the most
prominent young men of the city,
made a kite e few days before I left
home, ten feet in height. Matthews
went out to fy the kite while a strong
wind was blowing. He tied the strong
twine about his waist in order to keep
the kite from getting away from him.
Along came an unusually hard gust of
wind, and the kite carried him away
in the air in spite of himselL He
thinks he rose 800 feet from the
ground before the kite began to come
down. Then he found that he was
over the lake. The kite came down
so, gently, theagh, that he struck the
water with little force. At the same
time the wind freshened and he was
kept bobbing up and down upon the
surface of the water, until help came
in a row boat from the shore. He
got a good ducking, but otherwise
was not hurt. Before I left home he
told me that it would be some time
before he tied a kite string areund his
waist agai."-Wsshington Times.
Saved Boeth Flyred and Troeut.
"Flyrod" Crosby tells, in Shooting
and Fishing, bow J. E. Bladon of
Portland, Me., recovered a pet flyrod
that went overboard from the little
steam lanah of H. B. Kennedy ed
Brooklyn, N. Y., into fifty feet of
Bangely lake water. Mr. Kennedy
looked a 2 1-2-pound trout and Mr.
Bladon laid his rod down, with the
hook still in the water, to help lend
the hooked fish. The rod suddenly
went over the side of the boat ato the
water. It looked like a gone rod for
a while, but the engineer of the boat
tied strings together, with a
grapple on the end, and rowed round
the laanch. He got hold of some
thing on the second trip that wasee
lively and pulling hard. On gettisg
it tbo the surface the engineer Sound
that his grapple had hooked into the
line of the lost rod, which had been
pulled overboard by a thre-pound
t rout. The trout was saved seag
