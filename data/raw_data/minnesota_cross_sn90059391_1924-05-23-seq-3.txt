200 BOOTLEGGERS ARE SENT TO FEDERAL
PRISON AS RESULT OF WILLIAMSON RAIDS
HERRIN, ILL., May 18-With the
smoke of battle in Williamson coun
ty cleared away, revealing the over
whelming victory of the forces of
law and order in this community, the
metropolitan press seems to have lost
all interest in the actual results that
have been achieved. Williamson
county is no longer on the map in
their estimation. But this disturbs
but little the minds of the law-abid
ing, moral citizenry of this county,
who, as the result of the determina
tion to wipe out flaunting violations
of law, have placed 200 bootleggers
behind the federal prison bars for
terms varying from six months to two
years, with fines ranging from S2OO
to $2,500, closed 75 open saloons and
roadhouses, and caused many unde
sirable characters to leave the county.
The trials of the bootleggers and
their consequent convictions at Dan
ville was emphatic proof that the
people were not to be swerved from
their purpose to clean up Williamson
county. The assistance of the Ku
Klux Klan given to S. Glenn Young,
federal prohibition agent, wqs not
only countenanced but gladly wel
comed and proved most valuable in
the rounding up of the lawless ele
ments. It was the activities of the
Klan which interested the metropol
itan press in what was going on in
Williamson county, rather than the
intention of the citizens led by S.
Glenn Young and Klansmen, to pre
serve law and order in the commun
ity.
When it was clearly shown that the
reign of lawlessness, which for the
time being held full sway, was about
to be ended and that citizens gener
ally were giving the Klan a generous
share of the credit for the suppres
sion of the criminal element, the dai
ly newspapers promptly lost all in
terest in Williamson county as a
source of new’s.
But the people of the county are
proud of the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan and the part they took in tak
ing the reins of government out of
the hands of scoffers of the law.
They ae grateful to S. Glenn Young,
the federal agent, whose fearlessness
and energy in the pursuit of the boot
legging fraternity has routed the liq
uor gang out of the county, and are
more than satisfied that the daily
press, finding it could not fasten any
thing on the Klan more than the

strict upholding of the law, has with
great unanimity lost all interest in
Williamson county.
It may also be said that the mem
bers of the Klan in the countv are
also well pleased with the indorse
ment their actiors received at the
polls at the recent election, when all
candidates favored by the organiza
tion were eletced by big majorities.
Why worry with the sudden aloofness
of the daily press, when Williamson
county has been made a clean place

SHOWS WASTE OF WATER
Pocket Piece With Hole* Issued to En
able Average Person to Visualize
Amount Lost.
Those best qualified to express an
Interest In waste of water are those
who have the bills to pay. It Is in
communities where water Is not me
tered that waste Is most apt to be
Ignored, but in the long run the waster
pays the bill. To enable the average
person to visualize the amount of waste
that can result from leaving tiny
streams running, a Mattoon, 111., maker
of waterworks equipment has issued
a pocket piece resembling a S2O gold
piece.
This will assure Its attention at the
start, says the Selent'flc American. Of
throe tiny holes which are bored
through It, the largest is only one
eighth of an Inch In diameter, yet the
pocket piece liears the legend that In
a day of twenty-four hours, 3,000 gal
lons of water would be wasted from
an opening of this size. Another hole
which will not permit the insertion of
a pencil lend Is stated to he the po
tential waster of 900 gallons per day;
while a third hole Just large enough
to receive a pin Is nevertheless large
enough to permit the flow of 180 gal
lons or over 3% barrels. This corre
sponds to about 140 cubic feet per
week.
The figures given are for a head of
forty pounds. Higher pressure* would
Increase the waste, though not In di
rect proportion to their values. The
next time you see a tiny leak remem
ber that It Is capable of making a
larger dent In the purse thun appear
ances would Indicate, and do not be
surprised If a rigid Inspection of plumb
ing Is carried out at times when a
water famine Is a possibility.
Nut Trees for Wayside.
The American Tree association, an
organization devoted to the encourage
ment of arboriculture, asks why nut
trees should not be planted along the
waysides of this country, both for use
and beauty. The obvious answer is
that they should. It hapiwns that the
uut trees of this country are almost
without exception desirable, not only
for their nnts, but for every reason
that makes tree planting worth widle.
They are mostly trees of large size;
they are beautiful; and when they are
cut the timber which they supply Is of
high quality.
In his recent work on “Trees as
Good Citizens," Charles Lathrop Pack
mentions an Instance where a black
wulnut grew from the seed in Penn
sylvania and bore seven nuts In Its
fourth year. That, of course, was an
extraordinarily precocious walnut, but
the tree in ordlnury cases grows rap
idly enough to satisfy any reasonable
man, and. unlike the growth of pop
lars and soft maples, It lives to a great
old age.—Detroit Free I’resa.

EXPLORERS TO CHART
ARCTIC WILDERNESS
Geological Survey Men to
Fill in Blank Spot on Map.
Nenana, Alaska—Through the bit
ter weather of late winter In the Arc
tic circle and the peril of an unsettled,
unknown region, u purty of the United
States geological survey, headed by
Dr. Phillip S. Smith, is bound for the
remote Colville river basin.
This probably is the most hazardous
mission ever undertaken by this branch
of the government service. The pur
|tose Is to All In a big blank spot on the
map of Alaska containing 35.<M*i
square miles of unexplored wilderness,
and also to determine by mlneralogicul
tests the scope of an oil-bearing struc
ture known to exist between Point
Barrow, on the Arctic coast, and the
Colville basin.
Territory Uninhabited.
According to Gerald Fitz Gerald,
topographical engineer with the party,
the barren stretch Is uninhabited ex
cept along the Arctic shores, where is
oluted hands of Eskimos eke out a liv
ing by beachcombing. The country Is
devoid of timber, hut overlain by Bin
dra moss, save where streams cut the
structure and reveul coal beds and oil
seepages.
Fitz Gerald hns penetrated far enough
in the direction to learn that game ap
parently Is negligible, except for ptar
migan and an occasional colony of
beaver and muskrat. Without timber,
the party will he compelled to rely on
exposed coal for fuel und, lucking that,
on the meager supply of gasoline and
alcohol they can transport.
Seek Oil Deposits.
Before leaving Doctor Smith
said he expected to come out of the
wilderness by way of the Colville river
to the Arctic ocean. He explained that
the party would have to depend on
being picked up by u stray whaling
vessel and conveyed to the regular
lines of steamer travel at Nome. If
no whaler appears, the explorers will
cast their lot with the Eskimos until
relief Is sent.
The region to be explored Is believed
to contain vnst deposits of oil. A lake
filled with bitumen has been discov
ered near Point Barrow, nnd the sur
vey party will try to determine the
origin of this oil and Its commercial
Importance.
Take Dog Teams and Canoes.
The expedition was organized with
the care of u polar Journey. No sur
plus was carried, either In men or ma
terials. Doctor Smith contracted with
a company to transport his supplies to
the headwaters of the Alatna in the
Alaskan Rockies. At this point the
party is to plunge Into the wilderness.
Besides the dozen dog tennis, knock
down canoes were taken to be assem
bled und used when the streams are
free from Ice. Doctor Smith hoped to
reach the headwaters of the Colville
about May 1, so that the principal ex
plorations could be made In the brief
Arctic summer.
The geologists and topographers In
the party Include Dr. J. B. Mertie, R.
K. Lynt nnd Harry A. Talt. Four aids
complete the personnel.
