Our Post-Card Club
By Daddy Jim
Here are some more good letters.
Next week we will award the prizes
of the knife and pin.
Four From Texas.
“I am a boy 14 years of age. Igo
to school five days out of the week.
On Saturdays I go fishing some
times. I am a farmer boy, and like
the farm life. I have got four sub
scriptions to the Jeffersonian. Papa
takes the Jeffersonians. Curtis Moore,
Enloe, Texas.”
A Loving Letter.
“Dear Daddy Jim: This little girl
sure does love you. I have a doll and
carriage. I can cook. One time Mam
ma went off, and I got dinner for her.
I have five brothers and two sisters.
I sure do love them and everybody
else. I love Jesus, too; don’t you?
Stella Jones, aged 10, R. F. D. 6,
Marietta, Ga.”
When I Be Good.
“I am a little girl of nine summers;
have a cozy little home out in the
pine forests of South Georgia. I am
the only child. I go to school and
Sunday school also. I have a nice
time, especially when I be good. Irene
Cameron, Rockingham, Ga.”
From Illinois.
“I am nine years old. Papa takes
the Jeffersonian and is always glad
when it comes. I go to Rose school.
Our school will close February 11th.
I am going to say a piece the last day.
I have four brothers and two sisters.
Now I must stop. Ina Rose, Windsor,
Ill.”
Ten Years Old.
Two children —Gladys and Eva La
nier, write from Orvisburg, Miss., and
we publish the letter of the younger
child. Both letters are good, but we
like the little one’s best. “My father
is a great admirer of Thomas E. Wat
son, one of the greatest men in the
United States. I hope to be a good,
true Christian girl. I go to Sunday
school nearly every Sunday. I am
going on and work hard, and try to
be a good girl. Gladys Lanier.”
Likes to Read.
Oscar V. Hartsfield, of Tallahassee,
Fla., 12 years old, says he likes to
read, and he wants to see his letter in
print. Read this letter carefully, Os
car, and you will see you made some
mistakes, which we have corrected:
“Mr. Watson—lt is with much pleas
ure I write to you, for I think you
are a nice man. I hope I may make
as noble a gentleman as you are. I
am in the fifth grade. My school will
be out on next Friday. I could write
you a long letter, but have to close.
Good by.”
Some Post Card Clubs.
Pearl West, Paul’s Valley, Okla.,
sends in seven subscriptions; Joseph
M. Milleson, Slanesville, W. Va.,
sends the same number; J. T. Keating,
Reform. Ala., eight subscriptions; M.
A. Neal, Lockhart, S. C., eight sub
scriptions; Esther Maltbie, Crawford
ville, Ga., ten subscriptions; Charlie
Ross Thaxton, Crawfordville, Ga., ten
subscriptions. We have also received
this week a number of smaller clubs.
Keep the work moving. Every new
subscriber to the club makes it bigger
and better for you and for us,
, Gfye 3effersonlaft
From Bristol, Fla.
“Hello, children! Here comes a
jolly little girl from Florida. My home
is in the country, three miles south
of Bristol. The beautiful Lake Mystic
is but a few steps from papa’s farm.
The distance around the lake is three
miles, and it is surrounded with beau
tiful pear trees. Sadie Morgan.”
Sadie says she will get up a club of
subscribers for the Jeffersonian.
The Country School Again.
Twelve-year-old Annie Spence, of
Carrollton, Ga., writes one of the neat
est letters we have received. But for
one or two errors in spelling, she
would have won the prize. “I am a
country girl, and like country life fine.
My papa raises cotton, corn, wheat,
oats and hay. lam going to school to
my brother. I hope to see our country
schools in a better condition. My papa
has a grist mill and a saw mill.”
Good Handwriting.
A number of good letters came from
the rural routes near Carrollton and
Bremen, Ga., and the handwriting,
which is unusually good, firm and
clear, would indicate that the chil
dren are pupils of the same school.
The spelling and the composition are
weak. A slight improvement in that
respect would bring more than one of
these children into the prize class.
Two Letters.
Lizzie Ivey, who lives at Sprott,
Ala., is 14 years old, and sent us two
letters in the.last prize competition.
We did not have space to mention
them at that time. They were well
and carefully written, but neither of
them as good as a little personal note
which accompanied them. One of the
best points about a letter, you must
remember, is naturalness. Write just
as you talk—easily and simply. A let
ter should not be an essay, but a -talk
the spoken word put on paper.
A Young Enthusiast.
“I. am a boy eleven years old. I
help papa when not in school. I hope
to make a smart man, like you. Blaze
away, Mr. Watson. They may crush
the truth down, but it will not stay. It
will rise again. May God bless you.
“Your little friend,
“Herschel Eubanks.
“Conyers, Ga.”
From Chunky, Miss.
“Hello, Daddy Jim; how are you,
this gray morning? I have just been
out feeding the little snow birds that
stay around our door nearly all day.
We have only been in Chunky since
Thanksgiving Day, but I have lots of
friends here already. I’m afraid I
will go over the limit, so good-by. .
“Beatrice Lackey, aged 15.”
jA.n Old Veteran.
“I am ’a little girl thirteen years
old, and live with my grandpa. He
fought in the Indian and Civil wars.
Grandma says when grajjdpa gets your
paper and magazine he does not know
or care for anything but your good
reading. Mary George Shipp, Aonia,
Ga.”
Hundreds of Letters.
Out of the hundreds of letters which
we have received in this post card
club, only a few can be published each
week, simply because there is not
room for all. Don’t be discouraged.
Do your best.
