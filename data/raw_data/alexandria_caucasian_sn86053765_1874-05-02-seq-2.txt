The assertion ot ifwi Republican
that iJov. Moore released all tiro

is a slander anil a vialiciou« false

the Baton ltouge siil« for'months
previous to tho titbe when tbe,y

Thepeitjile of Louisiana are ac

. In the Parish of Rapides it is im
possible to raise a hog, a calf, a

serves to teed a negro too lazy to

as these paroons, that Hlcaling is as
safe as working, and is a much more
comfortable way of satisfying the
cravingspof*hunger, ft makes no
manner of difference whether the
h<?g, calf, beef or chicken belongs to
a white or black man—ho steals
from both alike.
One of these pardorfl'd convicts

to sell him tojinotbor negro lieco,

Ä dinrcpytable adventurer called
Ooliwfty waWat baud f<fpreside over
th*» new systejn, who besides pro
viding for doubling hrs own salary,
jiud securing as lunch, again in the
way of contingent fund, # crea ted a
horde ot new and useless offices,
clitet'among them being what are
called l M vision Superintendents at
saRitjes' of twenty five hundred
dollars* each, and with not a single
duty to perform. It is in this way
that the mulatto who has been sit
ting in t he Senate from this Parish,
aijd the negroes who have played
dummy in the Mouse, have filched
the money from tb<ô Treasury that
has been collected expressly to edu
cate the.children of the State.
Nor does this statement convey
the i"ll idea of their iniquity. <>s
Sensibly the School Fund is raised
to educate all children between écr
iai 11 prescribed ages, but practical
ly throughout tho country Parishes,
and notably in this, the fund is ap
propriated to the ttse of colored
children exclusively. Kvery dollar
therefore of this fund that is wasted
upon favorites, that is bestowed on
salaried officials without work, is
so much abstracted from the negro
children whose education they, pre
tend to have at heart. The lazy
lout s who come back from every
session of ihe Legislature with
bribes in their pockets and the evi
dence ot their infamy upon their
back, have helped to deprive scores
of children negro children here
of thousands of dollars, délibérait
ly and ostentatiously donated to
sinecu list s.
And while this is true of those
who conceived and brought forth
this iniquity of the School system
which nnilor the guise of fostering
the children of the State, is only a
cover for o|n>n gifts by way of sala
ries, and secret thefts, as wo sitall
presently see, what is to be said of
the local officials to whom is com
miffed (he distribution and proper
applicat ion of the, School fund ? \Ve
ask this question in all seriousness
and we propose to gel an answer.
The persons in this Parish who are
the custodians of the School Fund
are .lohn DoLacy, Thompson Coke
ly, <5. Kelso, Win. Kelso, John
Mayo, Julius Uallard, Dawson Al
len, Thos Kppsand Joe < 'onaughton,
one white lhan and eight negroes.
Two of tlleni alone can read and
write. This Hoard, if. that ho the
right statutory name, receives,
controls, disburses, or divides
among themselves 0 tho school
money of this Parish as it pleases.
Which do they do "l Has any man
here even seen any Account of their
disbursements
Does
anr-' m/in
here, white or black, know whether
thoy are partners in tho guilt of
public robbery, %r that they have
done the routine, duty of the'^offico
with as little, tilth sticking to them
as a Republican official is eapablt
of. We do know this much, that
the reports from every Division
the State are. unanimous in attribu
ting gross and corrupt administra
tion of -the -^School Directors, and
these re port s r are made by Radical
officials. Tho superintendent of the
District in which Rapides is, says
that although expecting to find
many irregularities in the proceed
ings of the different Parish Boards,
he was entirely unprepared to meet
such a demoralized, corrupt, and
inefficient cjass of men as he found
composing a number of the Boards.
In two of the Parishes, the former
treasuries had absconded with quite
a large amount'of money belonging
to the school fund, and in another
the public möney was invested in
private biisiuessand «peculation."
A corrupt and inefficient ('lass of
men! And he was entirely unpre
pared to meet with such a set! He
dkl know what class they were ta
ken from and therefore expected to
meet with it reasonable quantity of
knavery and thievery, but such a
profusion of seouudrejs he did not
expect to find in a single depar
j
nient of the jmlilic service —it was!with
an embarras des richesses. j
But there is another aspect of j
this matter for the Caucasians of
llapide®. For years their children
have not received the benefit Ot one "
dollar from th<r ttebool fund. It
doe* not seem possible to believe it,
but it is nevertheless true that these
persons whose names we hftv© men
tioned have for six years past, dis
tributed tho whole of, the school
money to which tho Parish is euti*
tied,- to the. liegro schools, and the
white people have seen this with
Uicir eyes amLyet have tolerated It.
hi the iiam&of all that is saerêd in
your eyes ye "Nv h i te people, why are
you trilling thus with your chil
dren's interests! You are not able to
sehd your children away to school.
"You see them growing up around
y du in ignorance. livery year you
are depriving yourselves of some
comfort to get mon L ey to pay your
taxes, and a part of these taxes is
■for th© support of public sqhools,
and yet yon look listlessly on While
the Board", in whose hands is put
the school money that you so ill can
spare—give evfcry dollar they do
not filch, to the negro schools While
yours are deprived -of - every educa
tional advantage to which they are
entitled.
the Ball.
The ball of tho gallant l*A<3tPic
Pitus Gompatwt No, 1, ou Wednes
day night was a complete success
and reflects a great deal of credit
lipon the several committees who
had the managemeht of the affair.
There was just siich an attendance
and even distribution otthe ladies
and gentlemen as insured the en
joymeut of all present. The de
lightful music'by the band of that
accomplished musician, MV. Leon
Chanty,, tho.. intermingling of the
red shirts and big hats of the Pa
cific* with tho white shirts and
tasteful white caps of tho "bully
Hooks,'' the general good humor
that prevailed and the efforts of the
VacificH to make everything social
and agreeable, all combined to
make this ball o 11 0 of the most
pleasant @ wo ever attended any
where, .
A. noticeable featcre was the sup
pty arrangements. Instead of tho
hurry and push that generally ac
companies the going to supper yn
these occasions, small tables were
prepared to seat parties of three or
four couples and the supper room
was as delightful as tho ball room.
We compliment tho originator of
Elbe idea and commend it to the
committees of arrangement hereaf
ter. Our firemen deserve such en
couragement as they met Wednes
day night and we like to see the in
terest our citizens take in them.
Success to them.
Tho gentlemen referred to has de
clined offices that the Editor of the
Gazette would have jumped a<, as
lie-jumped at that of Police Juror,
that being tho in fist, hin party had
confidence enough in him to give
him, and he need'nt have had that
if Grant and his bayonets had'nt
helped him and hin party to ï/««r/>
the governmental!' this State. He
never had any private ax to grind
as the Editor of tho Gazette did in
a certain piece of .job work that was
given him to do by the Polico Ju
ry, and which he had printed at the
Democrat Office for a certain price'
and then charged the Police Jury
nearly, if not quite, double what the
work cost at the Democrat Office.
It has been said by some people
that the Gazette ina:i is not even en
titled to that paltry office, because
he did not at the time of. Iiis preten
ded election live in ?ho Ward for
which he was elected. \Vo don't
know how true it may be. lînt
don't let him be discouraged on
that account, for snow that our old
time Coroner has had to vacate his
offing, much regretted and highly
respected by our community, at the
call of that grim visitor, death, the
Caucasian will run tho Editor of
the Gazette next Fall ibr the posi
tion of Parish Coroner , and may
be, when he gets into an office to
which he is fairly elected ho won't
bo so envious of-more fortunate
people.
W hat is the matter A gatn .—The
old jàdo of the Gazette gafiops off

This would doubtleés have been a
closely contested race, bnt that Mug

himself a full and serious injury and
got started after the others, Rapiden
flew the trade, jumped twenly-five

out serious injury either to him or

and made tho mile in 2 minutes and

The attendance was slim, and
owing to bolting of two of the horses,
the second day's races, like the first,
were not very exciting. The horses
ought^to bo better trained before they
run over the course again, and doubt
less will bo. Wo wish tho enter

W« think that both the Democrat
and Caucasian can manage to make a
living, the Gazette to the contrary, not
withstanding. We don't pretend to
wish, nor do wo in fact, desire to assist
in "discharging" any "old veteran, but
on the contrary, need the help of the
Democrat and propose to render it ;tll
the assistance that "green recruits"
can offer. Success to the Democrat !

that competent critic (I) I write 8tr,
ndt to see my name ia pwrt f bat ta
de'fend myself and school. As to
my change from "Fiincipal'' to "Prl
niary Bojiool teacher.» The school
is. only a - primary one and I am
principal of the fchool, end I have
an assistant teacher; Be seeks by
a play of worda to- escape the
f arx0) of my toroier card—
and I arti not' surprised at
it either, lor I know his capacity too
well t,o expect anythiDgrtse from
such à mutton -headed critic as he is.
Without Maying anything about
what I could do, if the Aêlnine gen
tleman will come- to my 'school, I
will guarantee that the youngest
and most backward scholar in tho
school, will teach him more about
logic and literature thalf he has dis
played in his last card—and more
about grammar and spelling than
his efforts would display if they
were left to him to write and not
corrected. Kot satisfied with try
ing to be critic, logician, and ass—
Mr. Whopping Lie Ambler, turned
lawyer and says that "1 have over
Ic ^ mmI my bounds and violated the
sdWol law." Well, that is a ques
tion for tho school -board ,aud the
Courts to decide, aud if thé Gentle
man will undertake tbe prosecution
I am willing to meet biui there. I
have already explained* about tho
"expelling" aud. he is welcome to
all the capital he can make out of
that.- If lie had a grievance his
proper remedy was to apply to tho
school board, perhaps those "three
honorable exceptions" would havo
had enough influence to get bUii jus
tice, but, no, that didn't suit hiin-—
he wanted to see his big earn in
print. As to tbe only thing in his
card that really deserves a notice
—that "contaminating influence
that just a few weeks ago surround
ed his school." I not only "urge"
but defy the gentleman to make good
his false, niaiicious and slanderous
charges, and, sir, don't it seem
rather utrange that nobody else but
this virtuous and christian gentle
man should have been able to ttud
it out? Ifiny school house was a
"place of public resort" audnobody
but him knew it, ho must have re
sorted there himself. Let him come
out with all that ho knows. Now,
sir, the "Hon. f.fj Oent. [fj takes
polities for his mighty hammer; he
uses the political question, as a fort
ress, and tries to niako it appear to
this community that I am the cor
ner fctono of politics. Why, sir, I
must admit that if I was its founda
tion it lias a veï'y poor one. As for
his anuoucing to the. oflicc aspirants
that they must first become a school
teacher, why sir that is a fact, lor,
then sir, there would not be so many
ignorant men in ottice. But he him
self being the first applicant and
failing to bo admitted, he goes off
us all bereaved ofiice seekers do.
As for myself, 1 want not to seo
my tainted [?) name placed upon
such a ticket, for sir, I myself want
men who when they make a law,
know what is tbe effect of that law.
I know nothing of law, not one
point in law, therefore it would bo
more than a disgrace for me to ap
pear upon a law-making ticket.
And therefore when Huntsmen—
Taylors and such other, debased
men appeared among tëe peoplo,
why, sir, even tho babes m their
cradle should vote to defeat them,
and I hope that an everlasting let
a lone may yet settle down on the
ruiners of our country and especial
ly on his carpet bag Secretary.

"War Path .—Wo call particular
attention to the advertisement of
War Path. Our parish is fortu
nate in having tbe services ot a
horse of such a pedigree, having in
his veins from both sides, the rich
est blood, of the best race stock in
America.
The terms arc very moderate and
General Wells has the best of pas
tu rage for the accommodation of
all marea that may be sfeüt to him.
