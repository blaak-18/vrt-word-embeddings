t Iely Day In Latayette-The
air a S eeo -our
Brass Bands.
Those who had any doubt as to
Lafayette's ability to entertain a
large number of guests have been
convinced of their error. Seldom
have our sttrets been as crowded
as they were last Sunday. Fully
S0oo stranger's spent the day in
town and The Gazette is pleased to
state that the cordial welcome ex
tended to them all was the subject
of some very flattering remarks
which our people may well feel
proud of. Several of the' excur
sionists told a Gazette man that
they were so pleased with the
hearty reception tendered, es
pecially by the ladies at the Fair
grounds, that they sincerely hoped
to again have an opportunity to
spend another day with the people
of Lafayette. Immediately upon
the arrival of the excursion train,
the visitors marched, in procession,
headed by a delegation from this
town, to the church grounds where
the preparations had been made
for their reception. When the
grounds were reached, Mayor Wmin.
Campbell delivered a short and ap
preciate address of welcome to
the excursionists and extended to
them the "freedom of the city."
Mr. Condom, of Houma, responded
for the excursionists in an eloquent
little speech, after which the crowd
dispersed, some going to the houses
of friends and relatives while others
proceeded to the long dinner tables
near by and attended to the wants
of the "inner man."
At about two o'clock the band
contest took place. The St. Mar
tinville, Breaux Bridge and Scott
brass bands were entered as com
petitors for the gold medal.
After each had discoursed some very
sweet music, the judges, Messrs
Campbell and Dojnengeaux, com
pared their merits and decided that
St. Martinville would be awarded
the first prize, Breaux Bridge the,
second and Scott the third, and
thus ended one of the most interest
ing features of the day. The fol
lowing are the members of the
bands: St. Martinville-Carlos
Greig, leader; Paul Fleming, F. G.
Guilbeau, L. J. Fournet, R. J.
Bienvenu, A. F. Gauthier, L. Bien
venu, Geo. Gary, Edgar Gauthier,
August Clement, L. Tertrou, J.
Bienvenu, I. Fournet, D. LeBlanc.
Breaux Bridge-Jean Durand,
leader; Leonce Ransonet, Clebert
Melancon, Lee Begnaud, Chas.
Jeanmard, Henry Decuir.
Scott.-Romain Venter, leader;
Duprelon Morvont, Erastus Del
homme, Chas. Delhomme, Paul
Delhomme, Jean Sonnier.
When the prizes were awarded,
it was announced that a theatrical
entertainment was about to begin
at the opera house. A large num
ber of people soon found their
way to that place where the inter
estesting comedy, "Le Jardinier
Grand Seigneur," was played by
our local talent.
A few more hours elapsed and
the time for the departure of *the
train arrived. It may not be out of
order to state that no disturbance
of any kind marred the pleasure of
the day. Good cheer pervailed
throughout.
Miss Dora Domengeaux, of
Breaux Bridge, was the guest this
week, of Mrs. Julian Mouton.
The Gatettehas received with the
compliments of the author, the
"Coxey March" by H. Vander
Cruyssen.
We desire to express our heart
felt thanks to the Scott brass band
for the sweet music discoursed at
our office Saturday afternoon.
The members of this band are
nearly all boys, but the iproficiency
which they have attamined would do
credit to some of maturer years.
The Sunday Law
The Sunday law, which we be;
lieve had been observed in Lafay
ette since the last term of court,
was violated openly last Sunday by
some salgon keepers, while others
kept their places of business closed
and missed a big sale.

HIORRIBLE DEATH
Of a Yotang Frenohmnan-Whlle
Riding ont a Brakebleam
I4t is 'hrown Under`
the Wheels.
Tuesday morning at about 3
o'clock, after a freight train had
pulled in from the east, a stranger
walked up to Henry Fontenot, who
was at work in the yards, and irn
formed him that a terrible accident
had happened. The stranger, who
gave his name as Gaston Delaporte,
said that he and a companion, Eu
gene Beseme, were riding on a
brakebeam, and that when the
train reached Broussard, a jar
caused Beseme to fall under the
wheels. The facts were immediately
telegraphed to Broussard, and the
answer soon came that the mutilated
body of a man was found on the
track at the east end of the yards
of that station.
Coroner Gladu was informed of
the accident and in Cetmpany with
Delaporte, he proceeded to Brous
sard, took charge of the remains and
buried them. As it was evident that
the death of the unfortunate young
man was purely accidental an In
quest was not necessary.
Delaporte was inconsolable; when
he looked upon the dead body of
his only friend on this side of the
'Atlantic, with whom he had emi
grated to this country two months
ago, he broke down and cried like
a child, and asked Dr. Gladu
to give him a lock of his dead
friend's hair.
Delaporte told the doctor that
they landed in New York two
months ago and were going west in
search of employtnent.
Beseme was a native of Tour
coing, France, and was a tailor by
trade. His only living relatiVe is a
student at the Jesuit's College of
Tourcoing.
The St. Martlnville iSatd.
We thank the Excelsior Band ot
St. Martinville for the melodious
music played in front of 'The Ga
zette office last Sunday afternoon.
As we are not a musician we will
repeat what a gentleman, who is an
excelleut judge of music, said after
hearing the St. Martinville boys:
"I have had the pleasure of hearing
the St. Martinville boys play various
pieces of difficult music and can
bear ample testimony to their pre
cision and brilliant execution. They
are ranked, and justly too, as the
first brass band in this section of
the State." The leader, Mr. Carlos
Greig, is an accomplished cornetist;
he is also the author of several
meritorious .;omp sit-, as.

The Entertainmefiti.
The entertainments at Falk's
Opera House Saturday and Sunday,
given for the benefit of the Catholic
church were very inteiesting affairs.
On both nights there were well
selected programs rendered in a
most pleasing and creditable nmal
ner. The success which has crowned
the efforts of our. amateurs, shows
how zealously they have labored for
a worthy cause and demonstrates
the fact that Lafayette may, with
justification, boast of actors and
musicians of no - mean ability. The
persons whose names are on the pro

Carenero News.
from Our RegularCorrespoadent.
There was a largely attended
meeting of the "Sugar Planters
Association" held at Alliance Hall
last Sunday, for the purpose of
acting upon propositions submitted
to them, and devising means for
the establishment of a sugar refinery
at Carenero. Mr. J. M. Jones
president, stated at length the
necessities of the moment, counciled
harmony, and showed very plainly
how it was within the power of the
planters to build and make a success
of a sugar refining plant here. The
president's remarks were listened to
with much attention, and it was
plain to see that every word was
fully understood and appreciated.
Hon. O. C. Mouton, when called
upon, explained in a very clear
manner how important such an en
terprise was, and how interested
each and every farmer should be
in the plan. His address was very
clear explaining the exigencies of
the present and the needs of the
future. Mr. Villavaso of New
Orleans was invited into the hall,
and requested to submit his propo
sition for the building of the refinery,
which he. proceeded to do in a very
interesting and impressive manner.
His remarks were interspersed
with much valuable information
concerning the manufacture of su
gar and profit thereon. Mr. V. E.
Dupuis submitted a very interest=
ing paper, showing the profits that
could be expected on sugar, pro
tected by the tariff, or bounty, or
without either. It is evident that
our people are thoroughly united
in their intention to establish a re
finery, and your correspondent
feels that he is safe in declaring
that it is an assured fact, and adds
one more white feather to the head
gear of Carencro,
-Hon. Louis Guidry, State Rep
resentative from St. Marttn's parish,
passed through town on the rath
inst. on his way to Baton Rouge.
-Quite a large number of our
people attended the fair at Lafayette
last Sunday, and of course had a
good time.
-For the week ehding May i ith
medals were awarded the following
young ladies attending St. Ann's
Academy. Ist class for "Lessons"
Miss Emma Babiheatt; and class for
"*Lesson" Miss Estelle Mabineau,
while Miss Liasie Dimitry carried
off the prise for good conduct.
--WVe make bold to say that Car
encro has more energy and enter
prise to the square inch thah the
balance of the parish put together.
Unfortunately we are lacking in
men of capital, brit fortunately we
aire gIfted with a certain biusintress
tact that enablds us to oveicorne
that disadvantage.
--Mr. Lnsemire of New iberia
was the guest this week of the fam
ily of Mt. A. C. Guilbeau,
-Crops are in splendid shape,
aitd the weather seems "made to
order."
-Mr. Roussel, representing the
Ferris Sugar Company, was in town
the early part of this week.
-Liberality at the proper mo
ment proves profitable in the long
run.
-Ctafety, the sugat men's faith
ful servant, will continue to guard
their intersts.
-It is evident that the school
children of Carencro are ignorant
of the legend relating to the name
of their town and section.
-Mlsrs Jeanmard and Boudier,
of Breaux Bridge, were in town last
week. The gentlemen inform us
that it is a settled fact that the
Teche Railroad will be completed
to their town during the month of
July. TOTIDEM VERB IS.

-Saturday's rain was a welcome
one, crops in general were suffering.
-Our young friend, Clifton
Young, has secured the agency for
the "Saturday Globe" of Utica, N.
Y. Cliff is a hutitler and we cannot
but predict him success in this new
enterprise.
-RoyVille tenders congratulation
to her sister town, Carrencro, in
having in its midst such enterprising
and public spirited citizens. In the
last few years Carencro has risen as.
one of the progressive towns of
South West Louisiana. With that
spirit of energy, so characteristic,
of them, the citizens of Carencro
allows no obstacle in the way of
their town's advancement. To
Carencro and "Totidem Verbis,"
we again say good luck.
-Tuesday last a bouncing little
baby girl was presented to Mr. and
Mrs. J. O. Blanchet. The little
stranger was at once made "at
home." Since the happy occasion,
friend Odilon wears a smile much
broader than usual; he is now a
papa. Mother and child are doing
well.
-Mr. Aurelien Primeaux would
like to call the public's attention to
the races on his track, on Sunday
the soth inst. Several fast horses
will try conclusions on that day.
-Middling at 6pj ? Oh cotton!
once king of all products, how
fallen Arid dethroned thou now art!
Where is the remedy, is there any ?
To prosper is nearly and impossibi
lity, as our only produce must be
given away. Must Royvillk ahd its
fertile and rich lands ever remain
exiles of both rail and water? Could
the capitalist invest his "coin" in a
better section, on better lands,
amongst better people? That hos
pitality natural to all Creoles, can
not be surpassed by any other peo
ple. Let us have a railroad, give
us means of transportation, and the
near future would tell how prosper
ous and wealthy this little inland
spot is.
-Mr. Giles Bonnesnaison was
down with pneumononia for several
days. He is now better; we hope
shortly to see him up, and ettjoying
his usual robust health.
-Walter Torian, itscq., of Lafay
ette was a recent visitor to Royville.
-Several of our people attended
the fair at Lafayette, Sunday. The
cause was a good one, and too much
praise cannot be given the managers.
S-In commemoration of the
valuable seivices rendered by our
office cat, we have named that
worthy feline, Grover Cleveland.
-So healthy is the country at
present, that one of our best known
"medecin's" has turned out to be a
first class gardener. We perceived
him, by chance, a few mornings ago,
hoing and digging like a profes
sional.
a-zRev. Father Chabrier, accom
panied by Mr. Jack lBonnemaison,
will shortly leave for a five months'
