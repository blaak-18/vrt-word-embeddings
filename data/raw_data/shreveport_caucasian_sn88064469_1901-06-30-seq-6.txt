LONELY HOMES
A home is never complete without children. Yet many homes are childless.
Many wives are desolate for the lack of a child to love. Their lives are aimless-void
of the high motives of motherhood. While barrenness is causing incalculable sadness
* and sorrow, it exists in most cases on account of some little female trouble, which
Wine of Cardui would speedily set right. This pure Wine regenerates the disordered
female organs by building up the worn out nerves and regulating the menstrual flow.
SIt restores the fallen womb to its proper place. By strengthening the generative
organs, it makes pregnancy possible where -, rrenness exists. You can depend on
S WImNE oCARDUI
Suffering women all over the land have been depending on it for sc- '- Tive years.
No more convincing proof can be giver than the testimony of Mrs. Benson, who is only
one of thousands of women to whom Wine of Cardui has brought a permanent cure.
Many cases of miscarriage-that trouble which robs mothers of their hopes-have
been avoided by timely use of the Wine. You are asked to try Wine of Cardui and
Thedford's Black-Draught, its companion medicine. Nine out of every ten cases of femaie trouble,
barrenness included, yield to them. All druggists sell $1.00 bottles of Wine of Cardui.
Vandervoort, Ark., April 2, 1900.
Last May I had a miscarriage, which was followed by flooding. I read your Almanac and my husband got me a bottle of W:n:" of Cardui
and it stopped my flooding and restored my fallen womb to its place. Now I am cured after taking three bottles and have ano'h'r to take which
I got this morning. I am expecting to become a mothcc and Wine of Cardui will be my doctor. MRS. MARY L. BENSON.
