In all large cities, in very vilhlige
thriougholiuiit thle Nourtlheii astern
States, there is lilt, nor has there
been for two years past, ally tadle,
protssitSion, or luisiu('5s that is not

willing and able to watd for almost
any wages, v;iinly roaming fronm place

cai'nnot lbut condemtiaii a eii ii i Iss of
young Dle hloret in New Yo'k whio,
withouit mteanls th selves, are wil

would ratler tall; the last gently
from titit m llotheli'rlK I' sistters thati

in Fifth avenule e1arnestly engaged in
"looking out for ia place."
'The sooner such creatures are
driven to work I)Y% absolute want, the
Ibetter will it he for themselves,', their
famtilics, andl the country . They a
drones in the hiiie. We consider any
able-bodied Anteici wan who deliber
ly levies contaibtions on the scant
pittance of a sister or a mother.. a
mtiserable apology for a Untan under
any circlmstatces; but when he does
it to ialittail himself in semi lnxii
rious idleness, the case is a tlhousandl
times worse.
It is no longer a question, evenc
with the most industrious andll wor
thy of ourtt young men, how they liay
best achieve fortuine, but how they
may earn a liViig. There are tell
applicants for each situation .lwhich
otters. We Ihave now on baud a ilarg
er supply of bankers, ibrokers, imer
chaits' clerks, accountants, doctors,
clergymen, lawyers, and tradlespeople,
than is necessary to tranisact thlie bu
siness of this communtiity. Every oc
cupation of this kind is overdone.
When, however, vacancies occur, as
will constantly happen in a great city
like New York, eveni if things are at
their worst, the extremely well-drcss
ed young gentlemnaa with a rose inl
his bout#onlicre, who has carefully
qualilied himself for lhard work by
two years of assiduous idleness, is
scarcely likely to be the successful
candlesa ,al uter tilese young gentle
men in search of eonployrnent will
exhaust the patience grill iteans of
those who assist or support them.
When that momenit arrives, we sug
gest thalt they abandon New York
and turn their attention to the only
occupation which is not overdone
farming. Let them go West, anid
assist in the crival of national pros
perity by working with their hands to
dlevelop our resources. To this it
must finally come. 'l'hey will be
driven from tlio city to the country,
tandl in the pictnresque language of
the West, the issune iof 'Loot hog or
dlie" nill be stu.a3cly placed before
them.
For those not afraid of hard work,
plenty to do mnay be found in the pe
troleuin region, where great activity
at present prevails. T'urtn asitlde tfrou
one of tMhe beautiftul valleys of Pennu
sylvania, into a ravine where you
attke your road as you go. In the
midst of the iirimieval forest, where
six motntlIs ago itnly the hauter foitiid

erected, atnd a shanty alongside gin
tamingng an olice a few account books.
Some round wooden tatnka are gt'ottpt
ed irregularly about it, ihto whticir
the iron tube raisiig up through the
derrick pours its stream of oil. The
ground is trodden lut) deep oily
lmire; the teamsters crowd up to con
vey away the filled barrels; two or
three- sontented-looking men are
checking them as they go. These
tmen left Philadelphia a year ago in
searelt of employuuemet. At first they
worked at *1.50 a day, Active, in
telligent, persevering, and industni
otis, they were soon enabled, pi.Irtly
on credit, partly for cash, but chiefly
by thu labor of their own hands, to
put down a well which yields them
twenty barrels a day, and is ntow pail
for. They wear neither violets nor
roses at their boa tonnieres, and are
dressed in clothes that would almost
do for shavitng glasses, so polished
and shiny are they with oil. 'These

The papem. which come to us from
the West and the Bonutl have con
stant and standing advertisenmnts
for money and mten to be esmjloÂ·yed
iD various agricnltural, mnatutictur
, mining, and couninercial tnder
ans. At a time when capital is a
'5 rtu utirket and profitable
investments were never so scarce,
when complaiuts as to a strphlus of
skilled and unskilled labor are heard
in all our great centres of populatiou
at the North and thle Eas, it behooves
our epitalises, and m0or1e especially
Sm~ployianenni,llt t~-aagn~dhe
ascertain where capital can be ad
vantageonely used, and where labor
is really wanted. We believe there
is urgent demand in Georgia, Ala
blama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and
Texas for certain classes of skilled la
bor, both in agrienlitural pursuits and
in all the various industries, trades,
and ocenpations requiring a degree of
intelligence, education, experience,
tult., and energy Inmrdly yet to be ex
pected from the average cohwed man
of those Statesb In Texas, cattle

'tures. In Louibians. sugar and rice
lands can be bought for a song. Now
that the Soatherm States' have self
government, and tioubles between
opposeing racesare no longer opeta
tive, the SouZO offers a broader and
more profitable field Air the advaata
geous employment of intelligent la
bor than any other portion of the
country. We recommend a serious I
examination of thus subject to those I
young gestlemeen hereabout who real- I

The Effect of Tobacco on the
Human System.
In theli fourthI annual report of the
Michigan State lBoard of IIHealth, Dr.
Scott ielates somiething new in the
infiuenceic of tobacco on the 'lsiuitan
s.ystemn, as ftllows :
'"'Theie has comiiie undelr miy notice
for several sears, but mole particti
us ily daring the last two years, a
iiind of rheliiiiuatic condition of the
, alls of thie chest. The patient com
plains of a dull Iheavy pain in the
chest walls. The dlisea;ise iln a large
majoriy oif cases i;is icontinedl to the
f left side. The pain is circuiscribed
aniid limited to a space of not imore
- than two inches in diameter, just be
Slow aniid a little to the left of the
left nipplelC. At times the pain is very
Ssevere, and always constant day alnd
s night, when the patient is awake. I
r have investigated the disease to soime
I extent, iand find it to be iore couiii
- mion among tobacco users, eslpecially
those who use the weed to excess.
II Pat iients snthring from1 tlihis cini laint
invaiiatbly come to their physician
a with thie belief that they have heart
tionble. I havie not foiund signs of
e IIIorganIic lesion in any of the cases that
e I have examineid, but there does exist
r in somie of theni what. might le called
e 'irritable heart.' I anm convinced
v tihat the greater nuitlber of tlieso
Cans sire1 thie result of ilnten perance
v eitlher in the use of tobacco or other
a stiniiulaiits, for thie ueasion that, whlien
r the patient ahbuius froni the use of
,s thlin for a short time, his pain ceases
- aind his onidition imiproves. In one
l raseu, where the patincut abstained
fromn the use of tobacco for thiriteenl
n months, the pain entirely ceased;
mibut at the eindtl of this period the
V gientlemiau recullumenciedl thle use of
y tobacnr , an1d afiter three weeks' use
i the old pain returned with all its se
Ii verity. I irn certalin that (lquite a

Rye for Pasture.
A corrcspond(lcnt of the Ellmira (N.
` Y.) Farners' Club wiites as follows
3 '"Fanners wiho are in want of fiist
t class pasture at least expenlse, fori) this
1season, should prepare a lot far the

'. the spring will not head out till thu
secoiind year, but will stool out so as

3 luxurian mass of feed that will pay
every explerimenltal trial. It can be

3 Ponltry for the Young People.
1 That it pays to keep fowls, few, if
I any, who know how to manage thtleil
r will deny ; bImt there are thousaods of
a people to-day who could otriament
t OsDne nook or corner in the'ir city or
1 townI lots w itlI a small hlock of our
e doimestic pets, and it would he well
.worth while for them to do so. Parents
s generally believe that it will pay to
spend their money and considerable
1 time in making 11om1 attrictive, so
their children maI1y love it. The
s care of poultry will be interesting and
I proHtable to tIme boys and girls, andl
if any one of the improved breeds be
- adopted, much pride will b3 taken in
r their breeding.
Hints About Flowers.-fl on ae
f plants otught to be stimulated gently
1 once or twice a week. Rain water,
I so refieshing to sumiuer Ilowers, al
i ways contaius ammonia, whicl also
abounds ill all liquid innmires. If
of ferized car
gallon of water, it will fllako spring
water even more stimulating to your
plants tibn rain water. If you
water your plants once in two weeks
I with guano water (one tablespoonful
to a pail of water), they will grow
umore thrifty. Chicken manure dis
solved in water is excellent. Always
keep the soil in your flower pots
loose. A cormn fn hair- pin used daily
will stir the eirthi sfficiently.-los.
ton Journal of Chemistry.
Agricultural Arithnmetic.-Farmers
are not given to cultivatiing how many
grains of wheat placed in a row it
wouild require to circle the earth,, or
problems of a similar nature; but a
little arithmetic of this kind applied
to more practical Mubject is worth
the while, as, fot instance, the follow
ing: Let two machinesr oDq cotting
four feet wide and the other five, fol
low each other in grain for one day,
each being drawn a distance of twen
ty-four Iniles; the former will have
cut twelve acres, the latter fifteen
acres. To cut 100 acres of wheat,
tIle former must travel 200 miles,
the latter only 6&. A saving of for
ty miles' travel with a heavy load at
the end of so long a journey is a
matter of no small importance. It
is a saving, too, of forty miles walk
ing, or ten miles for each of tIle &our
binders. It is a saving, also, to thie
farmer of two days' labor for himself
and teamr and. the wages and board
of the tbou bndetrs 6r two ay's, in
cutting 100 aores of grain.
