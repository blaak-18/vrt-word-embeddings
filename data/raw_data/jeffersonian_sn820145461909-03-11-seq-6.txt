ZETTERJ WHOM THE PEOPLE
INDORSES “BY WHAT RIGHT?”
Lawrenceville, Ga., Feb. 12, 1909.
Dear Mr. Watson: I must say that
I certainly endorse your stand in
regard to neglecting of our own poor
and sending all we can rake and
scrape to a crowd who do not appre
ciate it.
Some of this is going to stop when
people get their eyes open.
It is not uncommon for elders whose
salaries are $2,500 or more to take up
collections for their house rent, and
beg poor men, who work on halves and
never have ten clear dollars at one
time in their lives, to “chip in” for
his house rent, missions, church exten
sion, orphan’s homes, superannuated
preachers, education (’though his
family hasn’t time or means for edu
cation), Bishop’s fund, Bible societies,
etc., etc.!
No wonder so many poor fellows
give up in despair.
If he gets a nickel he can’t apply
it to the needs or comforts of his own
home or family.; but must “drop it
in,” or he is embarrassed by being
reminded of his obligation to support
the church, and especially its institu
tions, which are so numerous.
Poor fellow! He thinks the big D.
D’s. carry the keys to the “Glory
world” and when he is reminded of
his duty to take his church paper, he
succumbs to that appeal, too, if he
can borrow the price, which is always
enough.
Turn on the light; we have ignor
ance and superstition in church mat
ters the same as in polities. Yes, and
graft, too. With good wishes, I am,
Yours for reform, J.
“ELECTION RETURNS AND FU
TURE OUTLOOK.”
I
Gillsville, Ga., Feb. 11, 1909.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Thomson,
Ga.
Dear Sir: You will please find en
closed two dollars for subscription
to the two Jeffersonians, as I could
not well do without them. I prize
them above all the papers I read. I
have never told you the result of the
election at our precinct. We have
150 registered voters in our district,
but we only polled 24 votes, there
being 14 for Watson, eight for Bryan
and four for Taft. No one took much
interest in the election. I did what
I could for Watson, but as few came
to the election there could not be
much done.
I think every reformer ought to
contribute money to carry on a vig
orous campaign from now ’till the
next presidential election. For one,
I am willing to give one dollar each
year for that purpose. If the Pop
ulists will come along and help, I
think we ought to raise a fund suf
ficient to enable you to make speeches
in every State in the Union in the
next four years and let the people
see you and hear you speak. I am
sure the better acquainted they get
with you the better they will love to
follow where you lead. By all means
all of the reform forces ought to get
together. Surely all reformers can
agree on a platform of principles that
if enacted into law would better the
condition of the common people. As
to the name of a party, I care but
little, so the principles are right, what
ever name might be thought to be the
best would suit me.
One of the greatest helps to reform
work would be to get all the people
to read your two papers. lam ready
and willing to do all I can to help
you on with circulating the papers. I
will close by wishing you great suc
cess and good health and courage to
go on w r ith the great battle for the
right, and that you may yet live to
be president of these United States.
Yours truly,
J. M. Odell.
‘ ‘ WANTS CONFERENCE AND
SUGGESTS NAME AND
PLATFORM.”
Orienta, Okla., Feb. 8, 1909.
Thomas E. Watson —Dear Sir: See
ing so many advocating a conference
of all reformers, I am anxious to add
my say in favor of the movement, as
I see no other hopes for the masses
ever getting any say in governmental
affairs without they get together in
one party. Mr. J. R. Lowe just about
expresses my opinion in the matter.
I believe that the people might be
rallied on direct legislation through
the initiative and referendum and
right of recall, if conference is prop
erly managed. But we must have
Debs and the Socialists with us, as
all or nearly all of the Populists in
the west that were of any account are
now in the Socialist party. The name,
so it hasn’t Democrat attached to it,
will not make much difference. I
see that some good brother in the
South hates to give up the name
Democrat. He and I are just opposite,
although I was born and bred a Demo
crat and stayed with the party ’till
it completely sold the people’s in
terest out to Wall street under the
rule of the Democrat party. Since
then I have not only hated the name,
but was glad to learn that the great
Jefferson was never known as a
Democrat. If I had the framing the
platform and naming the new party it
would be the right of the people to
rule through direct legislation, and
name, “The People’s Social Party.”
Yours as ever,
P. B. Sharp.
THE ANDREW JACKSON HOE
CAKE.
Jackson, Tenn., Feb. 16, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I see my time for the
weekly Jeffersonian has expired. As
I do not want to miss a number, I
hasten to renew, for it is the only
paper that stands for democratic prin
ciples as was taught by founders of
pure Jeffersonian republican prin
ciples. I know one of the old guard
who ate of the ash-cake that .was
baked in honor of Andrew Jackson n
1843 in the town in which I now live.
It was then that the next year I
began to hurrah for Polk and Dallas,
the annexation of Texas and the un
ion. My time is, nearly up. I will
soon have to liand in my checks, but
ere that time my wish is that I Could
leave my country in the hands of true
reformers. Please give us the best
Jeffersonian
fight you can. I miss the Missouri
World so much, I want Paul Dixon
to be rewarded. I hated very much
for the paper to go down. But enough.
With the highest regards, I am, yours
in the middle of the road until traces
break, W. F. McKnight.
P. S.—l took the Peoples Party
Paper until the lights went out. I got
the New York Magazine until I did
know where I was at, so here goes
to the end. W. F. M.

“THOUSANDS CATCHING AT
THE LIFE LINE OF
POPULISM.”
Forney, Ala., Feb. 18, 1909.
Thomas E. Watson, Esq., Thomson,
Ga.
My Dear Mr. Watson: I have gone
to work for 1912 and I shall do all in
my power to spread the political gos
pel throughout my county. I have
been your supporter in every stand
you have taken and I have always
voted for you.
There are hundreds of men catching
at the life line of Populism. Let us
organize all the reform forces under
one name if possible. Let’s take the
best plank in all the reform parties
and make one grand platform and
rally the masses for its support. I
think we can all win a great victory.
I don’t care anything about a name;
it is principle with me. So just keep
on pointing the way? I am sure your
efforts are appreciated. I have - asked
and defied the organized Democracy
in my county to point out one single
not lAiow where I was at, so here goes
is not true, but they fail to point.
There is going to be a great awak
ening some of these days. It is going
to shake Hamiltonianism off the
throne and re-instate Jeffersonian
principles. I am,
Yours truly,
W. P. Minshim.
“PERSECUTION ON ACCOUNT
OF PRINCIPLE.”
J. S. Gibson, Whetstone, Ky.
I enclose herewith my check for
$2.09 for renewal to weekly and sub
scription to the monthly. I have been
taking your periodicals ever since you
first began the Peoples Party Paper,
in the 90s, but neglected subscribing
to the Jeffersonian Magazine,—in fact,
I have never had the pleasure of see
ing a copy of the Magazine. I am
a very busy chap but I never fail to
take time to read your editorials with
great interest.
In 1904 I drove 60 miles to hear you
speak at Glasgow, Ky., but on arriv
ing there I was grieved to learn that
you would not be there to fill your
engagement. I have voted for Popul
ism since the foundation of the party,
and have never felt lonely because I
was the only Populist in this county.
I have suffered lots of persecution
on account of' my devotion to prin
ciple but that has not had the slight
est effect in swaying me from my
duty. I have so rigidly adhered to
fair dealings in politics that I have
narrowly escaped assassination twice.
I do not believe that we ought to
take sides with either of the bull-dog
parties. I believe the political pup
pies are getting their eyes open and
there should be a union of all reform
forces under the name of Jefferson
ian. Wishing you success in all your
undertakings, I remain,
Yours for the cause,
J. S. Gibson.
“THE VIGILANTUS.”
Albion Gates, Carroll, Me.: Find
enclosed $2.00 to renew my subscrip
tion to The Jeffersonians. I would
like for the subscription of both to
expire at the same time, as I intend to
be a subscriber to both as long as I
live.
Something should be done at once.
I live in Maine; these four words plain
ly say I have no right to recommend
what to do, “Eternal vigilance is the
price of liberty.” My father, Galen
Gates, was an old 49er. In those days
in California the miners formed vig
ilance committees to protect them
selves from the robbers in the country
and they were called “ Vigilantus.”
Now we have robbers galore in many
parts of the whole country. Out of
the present chaos should a new party
of reformers be formed that the peo
ple may be assured from their insbai
pie may be aroused from their indif
ference, read and remember the words
of Jefferson, “Be vigilant and continue
to be.” How would it do to call this
new party “The Vigilantus?”
“TAFT AND THE SOLID SOUTH.”
Hood River, Ore., Feb. 6, 1908.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Sir: Enclosed I send
post office money order for one and
one-half dollars, amount of which
please place to my credit and continue
the monthly Jeffersonian so that I
may not miss the February number.
Among the many receptions and en
tertainments of Mr. Taft for the pur
pose of breaking the “solid South,”
I notice the conspicuous absence of
the names of the labor leaders and re
formers in the South. I presume
he is only making himself solid with
“rich and well born,” which includes
bankers and corporation magnates.
Yours in cause of reform,
Charlie Davidson.
“THE PRINCIPLES OF TRUE
DEMOCRACY ARE GOD,
HOME AND COUNTRY.”
Venus, Miss., Feb. 9. 1909.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I don’t ask you for a
premium for the enclosed list of new
subscribers to your publications. You
are at work for me and my family
and our country all the time—per
haps a great many times while I am
fast asleep.
Yes, I am in favor of that council,
and a short platform. The money
plank would be my platform if I was
the dictator. The name of the party
has no weight with me. My motto is,
Get the people together and teach
them the true principles of Demo
cracy, so that they will think more of
wife and children than they do of
party. True Democracy is God, home
and country. a. Page.
