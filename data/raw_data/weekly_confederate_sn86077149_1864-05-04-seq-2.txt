VloV. Yauce and Mr. Holden.
A very gieit misapprehension exists as to
the position of v. Vance towards the A !-.
m:r.!strtion, tnd towards the true men who.
tr 5upjyjr:ing him against Mr. Holden.
We were careful observers of Gov. Vance's
iiiiK.aI aitltnJc liefore hi Wilkesboro'speech,
-vi I'efore th announcement of the Georgia -I'i.iiforu.
We knew thai he was a partiz m
liie leader t)f (lie Gmservative party in the
State. Wekr.ew also that he frvored repeated
f.- ?..ati I -r peace to be :rrM urxn tiro
Co..fw.!cra.!c Crvr:inisr.t by tho State author
it, s is t ? i idi??c th G errnvnt -to a?
to mate Hipti. We krT tht he was
o, n'ni to the pu pension of the h'lh'ns corpus,
though we had understood Ihnt lie warned
Mr. lUJeu that illegal rvita'ion. wsch a
mct-iing which declared far Vum ' Union bs

We had heard of his letter to the President
advising against the suspension, aud ogaiu
.1 ivUin, Mg-iiu-t arrvsts. Indftd we haJ heard,
a. id .. believe '. true, thit hut fnrGuv. Vance,
Mr. IM ln rS th ? E lit )T of the Vrogrru would
have been rrrested long ago.
We r:-iv thereforenot at a'l takeu by sur
prise vhen Got. Vance advocated peace pro--ilions
to be ma-Ie by our government on all
favorable oceiorn: n'r to her that he wrte
t i Gov. Brou, a-1 vising h6m to unite Snurgin7
to c-.ire upon the PresiJent. The fn'k of

jr-vitig the trnimu of either routs.
r.ov. Vioon rnl to peace lends to the
practical, loyal, vendible efforts to negotiate
through tiie proper authority to wit : the
Confederate (lovr rnmeut ; and when he clahns
the oriiuof the Georgia platform, .he explains
how. He shows hi.1 letter to Gov. Brown, in
vitiug him to unithnd solicit the nction-rrHhe -President
with a virw to ueg tiiitiofl. Mr.
Ilol leu's route leal to a Co.ivcnthm gotten up
under fi.'rca denunciation uf our government,
stimulated by threats of dastmotive notion,
c ille J to " I Ue alfiirs into it vrxn hands" to
protect a-unst the t-ucroaehntcuts of despot
ism " tn tre:it " hy itself, only referring to
the goverp.ru -ut the terms it had proposed, or
those which were- proposed to it. A Conven

but b th rady to com promise and treat." A Con
vention thit w.-i to suiTeudcr Missouri, Ken
t'lokj and Vet Virginia, without allowicig their
ritizen to vote or choose where they would go.
Tin y.i Ji-i l is Mr. Holden? route to pease.
As can lu pr ; veil every word from the Standard.
W li iiiiy Ulrglt rrpunttri W:
Mala!ive been the freaks of Gov. Brown
u'i 1 Mr. Siephros, they never contemplated for
a m m;'at whit Mr. lloldeu nonght to carry
out. If u'jf. lrowu hid acceded to Gov.
Vance's invitation, he would have sat down
and written to the I'iesl Jeut, and then he would
i.ave learuci that of all men in the nation, Mr.
I' ivi-4 wa amoug those mo.t desirous of peace.
vtuuIJ ha? lerned Gi t Mr, lavis had
iai le several eifoi tat to procure peace, and he
would either have found Mr. Davis ready to
rjuew the propositi jo, or to assign a. satis
factory reason why it could not be done at that
tiuie. dnd then, porhaps Gov. Brown and Mr.
Stephens would have been saved the' commis
sion of a blunder they would have been saved
an association with Mr. Uoiden, which, as a
avitter of political history, will do neither of
them any credit.
And the dlff-ronce between Gov. Vanco
And Gjv. Brown is, that tho. latter 41 ran a
muck," for political capital, to gt up'a party,
an 1 occupied tho sttitudo of doing this in'a !
tiait- of areat national peril. Gov. Vance
tjuu-lly wrote to t!ie l'resideut, aud urged up-i-t!
iim to negotiate, ft possiblo, for peace
with indepcu deuce, a "d wrote to Gov. Brown
t aid him in prevailing on the President.
Practically, Gov. Vance if tho only one id"
the whole concern who has shown vny judg
uotit in the :n'atttr. .
TncreUuo materul difference between Gov.
Vanco at fayctlcvilleand at Wilkesboro'.
W'c do not concur with hiui at either place
altogether. But at preseut the contest is be
tween Jiim and Mr. Holdeu. As between them,
hiyal men canuot hesitate for though a par
ti ;.an, Gov. Vance is a patriot, and the honor
cf North Carolina, her fidelity to her sisters,
to our soldiers and to the. great cause, is safe
ia his hands. And as we see no disposition
to run in botwoen the two Conservatives,'
and not the least likelihood of another candi
date, we remain by the most -Worthy of the
choice that we have.
Lincoln and the Yankee press are trying to

which he participated. Ue says the garrison

and the Magazine saved from explosion. It
is supposed to be the work of an incendiary,
and intended as a set off for a like attempt
made gome time ago on the Yankee Magazine
in Chattanooga. We rejoice to know that tho
fcc.'uudrel who set It ou - fire was foiled in his
undertaking, although he escaped.

appropriately -now the " circle' the indcfatH
gable supporter of Mr., lloldcn brings his cLa tu
piou up for the SO rovnd tho prize ahead
being the '"Georgia Platform." The other pl
gilist, who wears the belt, Gov. J. B., with
his socoud, Mr. V . P. S., are already in the
circie, squared for the encounter. Our political
llecnan, the Benitia Boy, stems rather the
worse tor wear ; hoth eyes are unquestionably
bunged, if we " ever saw" a bung eye before ;"
and if that is a nose, without a doubt it is a
nose of t'.e most extraordinary color, dimen
sions and shapo that the eye ever dwelt on;
partakingin its physiognomy of Rome, Greece,
aquiline and pug. But the fight is by no
means out between the two combatants ; the
prize is worth the struggle ; and our side, if
it does "feel badly," cau readily be revived ,
with a little brandy. The "circle' is cleared
tLe two pugilists take attitude face to face ;
neither being williug to "prosecute steps'
looking to au honorable peace," until "one
side or the other is wdiipped good." The word
is given "patriots' '(the two are called
Patriots) "begin."
This word is given by the seconds who
hold tlie hats. They are called "properfy
holders,?- because each has in bis bat the
" Georgia platform," the property 'contended
for. At the word, the " Patriots "go at it
smash-bang the "property holders? hurrah ;
foureyesare more essentially bunged; two
noses more essentially khooked out of joint,
when just in the critical, decisive moment, a
new party, not n the circle r-neither a
patriot nor a proper holder ' in the sense
we have described wades in with his eyes "
wide open, and -seizes the courted prize the
" Georgia platform' and walks off with it.
And any day "he may now be seen sitting
complacently pn its planks, while the dis.
com6ted' pugilists are nursing their bruises.
When the public hereafter see in the Ral- '
eigh Progress the quotation ; ' Patriots and
Property holders," if it refers to the " 39th
round, " it will discover the allusioq, .
Gxn. B. B. VAos'-t-Gen. Vance, captured
some time ago in Western North .Carolina, is
confined in the city jail of pjnoxille,
We find the above in our exchanges. It is a
mistake. Got. Vance has received ft letter of
recent date from General Vane, and he was
then at Fort Delaware, We hope the General
will soon be exchanged and be in the saddle "
after the raseally toriea in his native mountains.

The land forces marched from Tarboro' tm
Friday, tho 15th, naving beeu quietly 'aiid
rapidly . collected at that place daring tha
tdlntof the 14ih On Suuday, the lfth,-'nt
4, p. m , we were within two miles of Ply
mouth, having marched through swamp ami '
across s wul ten creeks a distance of sevtnty-;
five miles' without the kimv lecle if il e ene
my. His picket on the Washington ro.ul
was taken" our infantry thrown iniulme and
tlw batteries into position. Kemper's bri
gade, with a battery of 12-poinder Napo
leons and three 20-pnunder parrotts, was
dotashed t- atta;k V.'rreu Neck, a strong
position on the rivor a mile above the town,
which the enemy thought and we feared, would"
effectually stop the passage of the Albemarle,
and so deprive us of her valuable aid, and
by leaviug the gunboats iu the river near the
town, seriously increased the m difiioulty of
taking it. .."
The march had been long and rapid, and
the raf-n were much fatigued, but e-iger'tb'
advance at once, and entering the place with
the pickets, take it by a co;jo deinain. and
fender effective the surprise, which was evi-
4 dent we had accomplished. Such, I am told,
was Gen. Ransom s deswe, but Gen. Hoke
decided to proceed more deliberately.
Plymouth, asis ktvn to all your readers,
is s-itn&ted on the south' bank of the Roan" ke,
w! ich here flows in an easterly direction.-
Tlie q n is app'ro.iched by four roads, the
Wasbiogtou on tlAj west, the Columbia on tha
east, along the liver, and between tin so two
the Rath and Lee's Mill roads. The defences
of the town consisted of the following works:
On the vei of the Wnshiugton road about
eight bun8r3 yards from the town, a strong
eanh work, Fort V esse II, surrounded by a
deep moat and-. mounting "three gui.s, one 32
punder and two 6-poundeis. On the east of
the Columbia road, a work with a moat iu
fr ut and stockades in the rer, mounting
I wo 32-poundeis and two 12-poitnders. Ou
:he west of the same road, a wed constructed
work with a moat in front, but open in the '
rear, mourning three guns. In the rear of
this and within the town was another work,
partly earth neatly turfed, and parily st ck
iiilo, facing to the south east and open to
var;'s tue. river, mouoiing two guns, the
8t;vkades heiog pierced for musketry. Toe
Lee's Mill. Bath and Washington toaiIs we e
covered by a line of -heavy im frenchmen tf
mo' tiling nine gnns and terminating at the
latter road in strong fort surrounded by a
very wide and deep moat, and mounting six
heavy guns. Tins was Fort Williams, as
strong to resist bombardment or assault as the
skill of engineering could make it. On the
river face of the town was a camp entrench
ed to resist any attack from the water, and
a iittle Iowr down an earthwork for the same
purpose. The force in the town and at War
ren Neck consisted of the 10th Connecticut,
85th New York, 101st and 103d Pennsylvania,
two companies of Massachusetts heavy ar
tilleiy, one battery of light artillery and two
squadron, of cavalry; the whole commanded
by Brigadier General Wessel, of the old United
S'ates army.
Ou tho night of the 17th, an attack was
made upon Warren Neck under .the direction
of Col. Peering ; and a gun boat of the enemy
coming to the assistance of the. garrison, was
sunk, and a force of infantry sent from- the
town, was repulsed ; but tho enemy success
fully resisted all attempts to take this stroug
holtb,. On Monday our artillerybpened ig(r
ousfyH upon tb town; and during the day
both parties pounded away at each other in
cessantly ; but. beyond a-little skirmishing
with the enemy, and manceuveriug for posi
tion, our infantry - did nothing. Toward
evening, however, it became evident that
something was on foot; and Ransom's brig
ade, 'w;ith the 8th N. C, was drawn up in the
woods facing the works on. the Washington,
Lee's Mill and Bath. roads. A heavy line of
skirmishers was thrown out under the com
mand of Capt John C. Pegram, A. A..G. ;
and advancing rapidly with the peculiar gait
of the sharp shooters and the yell with which
our boys go to the' charge, drove' the enemy
back into lm works, and approached within
two hundred and 'fifty yards of the fort, ear
nestly demanding to be led into the place. .
Meanwhile Pegram's battery dashed forward
at a run. supported by the iniantrv. and un-
limbering delivered a furious fire upon the
dvoted. place. Three times .w&AcWnced, each
time nearer, until within good charging dis-
tance; but the artillery had it all to themsel ves.
The movement was merely a demonstration
to call off the enemy's attention from Hoke's
attack upon fort Wessell, which after a short
but sharp resistance, fell, before the superios
powers of Hoke's brigade; and that night's
work was done. Leaving a line of pickets oq
the field, the main body of the troops with
dre w to prepare, by a few hours rest, for the
attack, which we all felt would be made on -the
morrow.; arfd as we lay down by our fires,
every one wondered at the Albemarle's delay, ,
and prayed for her speedy arrival. At three
in the morning we were, all awakened by the
thunder of her Blakely guns, as she defiantly
saluted Warren Neck, en passant, and- sailed
safely by, over the obstructions which the
enemy had placed in the river. She went to
work at once among the enemy's gunboat,
sinking one and driving the rest to Ifatferas,
and then'turning her attention to the fortifi
cations she kept up .a speedy fife during the
morning, silencing the enemy's guns and driv- .
ing him into bis bomb-proofs. But still the
"stars and strides'' floated over his works ; '
and as he refused when summoned to strike
his colors, it became necessary for us to do it
ourselves ; nd the eVening and night of the
19th, were devoted to preparing for the assault
on the morning of the 20th.. Kemper's brig-.
age had fought gallantly at Warren Neck.
Hoke's men had taken Fort Wessell with three
guns and sixty piisoners. It was now Ran
som's turn.'
- The Columbia road, which enters the town
at its eastern extreinity; running parallel with
Cbe river and near if, crosses Conabay creek
about a mile from town. To this point Ran
som's brigade, the 8th N. C. and Pegram's
battery marched late iu the evening uf ;ho
U h. befeiod a screen u( Woods, which bid the
movement- frm the peiuy. and 'reached the
creek abonLFUn t; The bridge via destroyed
and tbek todep to be forded a "stmuj;
picket" of the etiernv on . the opposite-bank
behind entrenchments, and nlxmt three-qnart-rrs
of tt mile orT iwn 8 2-pounders and five
12-ponnders berinr on th sfor. The pon
toons must bo laid for the infantry and artil
lery to cross, and thst quickly, or the move
ment would be a failure. The moon wss
shinif g brightly, turning rdghi almost inta
day. and not a breath of air was stirring, so
tat tjypry movement we md could be dis
tinctly ppen r heard by the enmv. Lieut.
Marshall Lee, with tweotv m-n f com pan v K,
24th, was advanced to. the water's edge, sup
ported by the rest of the company, and co. A,
of the 86h, he whole under the command of
Capt. Bnrra Lane. The pontoon trdn, tinder
Lieut Pool. 101 h N. C. T., danhetl ilown at
a g-allop, slid one boat into the creek and.
quickly and rapidjy the two companies crossed
and were immediately engaged with the ene
my. The 24th followed at once, thi men
cming iuo line as fast as tbey rot over. and
the enemy fell back closely pursued bv Capt.
Lane's command, deployed as kirmisher.
The pontoons were now laid and by & o'clock
the infantry was over and formed in line of
battle, the left res' ing on the road and the
rk'ht on the river in the followiifg order : first
on the riaht the 58M. second the 25tl, thinl
the 8 h, fourth the 8&th, fifth t: 24th, with
two companies on the south of the nwHl. Iu
this position w lay during the night. he I tar
ing ourselves as, well as we oould from tlie
t'liemy's two works on the road, which. kept
up noons' ant fire until nearly day -break. Just
before day a strong line of skirmishers was
thrown out before the hrisade under command
of Capt. Durham, Q. M., 29lh If.JU. T., but
acting temporarily eu Gen. Ransom's staff.
Under this gallant young officer these
brave men pci formed prodigios of valor, contributing-
laiguly to the success ofthe.day,
and compelling the admiration of tho euemy,
whose commanding General remarked - after
the battle wnsove, that he had mrer seer, such
skirmishing; that though ho three times reiu
forced his own skirmislters, he could not
check ours. At just 3J in the morning of the
20th our line began to move forward, slowly
at first, dressing i rt the'eentre, and halting oc
cassional ly for that purpose. Fron theftart
the fire from the enemy's batteries was THpid
rand severe, striking down tnanv a brave fel
low ; but closing up the gaps, the long line
movtd silently on, the left still resting on the
road, till Pegram's battery dashing forward
at a run tirlimbered in front, aud opened
firo on the enemy's works. Then for the first
time that morntBg our boys gave a leud yell
of defiance, and quickening their pace to a
'double quick pressed with a determination
not to he nsisted right upon the enemy's two
works, which were taken with scarcely a
moment's dt lay.-the one on the Scdth of the
road by the Itjft of the 24th, led by Colonel
Clarke, and the one on tho right by
the right of the 24th. assisted by the 25ih.
The enemy thd in terror to the houses,
Fort William, and any other place which
offered them protection from the tierce - fire of
pursuing ranks.
We were now in tho town, aud the head
-of every street running enst and west was
held by one or more of our regiments j but
their position in line was somewhat changed.
The s)4h yrna atiil or) the Columbia road, now
"stre with tho 56lh and 25th to the right
and the 35th and 8th to the lft. Halting. a
moment to breathe the' men and dress the
lines, wejpushed slowly and carefully forward,
clearing the enemy from ercry street, yard
and house, from the windows of which and
from behind the fenres they poured an- in
cessant fire. But nothing could check our
!' 'progress, and iu an hour the enemy were all
viinBu luiui uii Miiuaiu ur me euireueneo
camp. The fort wa on our left and the
camp in front. L-avinhe 35th, the 8th
and a portiou of the 24th to contend with
j the fort, the rest pushed oa for the camp.
wmcn tne z-atn, oemg on tue riirect road, so -n
reached, and opened fire, exposed still to a
severe musketry fire from the fort on the
flank and the camp in front. In a few min
utes the 56th came up on the right by anoth
er street, and by their arrival decided the
contest, for immediately on the appearance of
this additional force,, the enemy threw down
his arms, and raised the white flag. - Capt.
LockheartoM.he ,56th ran in to. receive . the
surrender ; and . instantly both regiments
poured into the camp, and throwing down'
their own foul guns and empty cartridge
boxes took the -clean, well filled ones which
were lying about, aud pressed on through the
tents to tha western side of the camp, where
they, could see the tJuited States flag floating
over Fort William, evidence that the fight
ing was not yet done. Here we were shortly
joined by the 43rd N. U. of Hoke's brigade,
who came, in from the west, haviAg been de-.
layed by a mora s, which they bad great dif
ficulty in crossing. ..m
The loum was ours. Everj house and street
in it was swept of the enemy, who, 'shut up in
his strong hold, etill refused to surrender.
This was a ease for the artillerist, and the guns
of the captured forts were soon turned upon
their stronger brother, fighting as the result
shows, better for us than they had against us.
Capt. Cooke too, of the Albemarle, dropped some
of his 90-pound shell among them. Still they
resisted stoutly, , showing a disposition to die
rather than yield. At last however seme of our
boys creeping forward through the entrench--menta
goto efiladiogfire upon them, whioh
soon brought them to terms ; and hundreds, of
them rushed out of the fort without arms and
surrendered. Just at this time a shell burst
directly on the magazine, and when the smoke
cleared away, the hated flag was flattering
rapidly down to the ground. Without waiting
for orders, the brigade swarmed into the fort,
Co. B, of thd 24th leading, and the color of
every thing was quickly changed from hint to
grey.
. Thus ended the greatest battle ever fought
in North Carolina, and if properly followed up,
the most important. Let the sons and daughters
of the bid North State rejoioe, for the day .Of
her redemption is at hand. LONE STAB.
"Honor to Whom Honor .' We met
with Rev. Dr. Deems oo yesterday, after an
'absence for a month on his Soldier's Orphans
mission, and learned that in . the counties of
Anson, Stanly, Cabarrus and Mecklenburg,
contributions were received to the fund
amounting to upwards of thirty thousand
dollars rone-half of which was given in tne
town of Charlotte where our Jsraelitish
friends contributed most liberally. The Pot
ior said that one of those liberal Hebrews left
Lis' subscription open to tho last, as he bad de
termined to give as much as any christian,
(whatever that might be. In ail works of
general charity, it is dne the Jews to say that
they are never bs behind ksad.

Honor to whom Honor h dui:. The

To obviate the possibility of error, rs thero
are two Harrises from Maryland in Courres,
we would tatc that the distinguisheden
tleiuan is Bsiijamin G. Harris, t.. Mary's
county, and not J. Morrison Harris, cf 3lti-
more, a man who, as the Examiner says, has
been spewed out of the rrjnnh of every politi
cal party that ever existed.
