FRIDAY, January x, x897.
Louisiana does,!not license a bal
lot box stuffer, it rewards him.
The Democratic press will soon
cry out that a Constitutional Con- 1
vention is unconstitutional.
Disasters dire are predicted for
'97. One of the most prominent I
will be the inauguration of Mc
Kinley.
The official news of Spanish ope- r
rations in Cuba reminds us very f
vividly of Democratic reports of
a Louisiana election. d
Boatner, better known as Flop
'ping Charley, defacto Congress- F
man from the Fifth District, wants
to iraise the salaries of Congress
man., This is the first joke Boat- tl
ner has ever sprung, and every one t(
is laughing. in
Alexandria had a large fire e3
Tuesday, in which the Exchange
Hotel, a residence in the rear of it, L
and Capt. White's law office were fa
laid ih ashes. Particulars are mea- la
rer, though 'it was thought to be is
accidental. ,w

rT, FObTERISM.
- If ever a man built up his own
narrow selfish ideas into a policy
- and rii(ldly enforced that policy on
the citizens of a State, that man is
itor. Gov. Foster, and that State the
Ixor. once sovereign State of Louisiana.
Landed into power by a small
$0 faction of his party through
40 a dicker as devoid of principle
as its commercial features were
glaring and shameful, this man
rear.
proceeded to entrap, buy and
15 00
20 no bully the majority which had
?ý opposed him until the whole I)em
on 0o ocratic party submitted to his nar
14 00
u on row policy much like the charmed
bird submits to the blandishments
itn- of the serpent. Then the State
per itself began to feel the sickening i
ente symptoms of 'the disease now
known as Fosterism.
per
Prominent namong these symp
toms are the following: Controll
n ing by patronage both branches of
oltd the Legislature in all legislation,
n and the selection of relatives and
personal friends for U. S. Sena- ]
tors and Circuit Judges-ignoring l
the popular recommendations for a
.. appointments, and allowing some ,
al- aristocratic humbug in each parish,
or a dirty ward heeler or boodler
in the city to dictate same-allow- c
on ing officials of trust to embezzle, b
n borrow or steal public monies n
without let or hindranbe--pardon
or ing out of the Penitentiary his o
at political friends, most all of whom
[c- have either gone there or ought to b
go-and last, but by no means
least, the debasing of the sacred
e- right of suffrage to the level of a
ry farce.
Each of these symptoms have
developed into chronic ulcers up- bh
on our body politic, and together
they make up what is known as
Fosterism. to
'. But it is to the 3rd symptom of ha
. the disease that we wish to call at- se
e tention this week-that of allow- p
ing public officials of trust to em- oa
bezzle, borrow or steal public mon- as
,e ey. be
e The case of Sheriff Broussard of an
;, Lafayette, who was largely in de- lai
e fault when Gov. Foster issued his ern
L- last certificate of a stolen election, iz(
e is well known to people of the
whole State, thanks to the Daily
Item.
But now comes one of his tax fr
Scollectors in New Orleans, *vho
Shas pocketed the modest sum of po
*$7,500, and coolly says he don't len
9 know what became of it, and goes ne
right along as free and easy as ifne
Snothing had happened-because he oni
r is a political friend of the Govern-oi
Sor's you know---Col. H. D. Mon
ier. This exposure is also due to
ithe Daily Item.
Our half brother, the Shreveporti
Progress, shows up one of the4th
symptoms of Foesterism. We re-wa
print the Progress' denunciation of
this crime elsewhere, because it is mG
almost as severe as was his denun
idation of "we Radicals and nig- p
gers"-who last Spring attempted
to wipe out this disease. t
Every now and then a "reform" con
Democratic journal will jump on ef

1Mrs. J. T. Howell.
)wn A Fair Populist's Impressions of
licy the St. Louis Convention.
º on
n is Mrs. J. T. Howell, of Baton
the Rouge, La., who held a proxy at
ma. the St. Louis People's party con
nall vention, is, on her father's side, a
agh granddaughter of Capt. Jos. N.
iple Chambers, U. S. A., who resigned
rere his commission, married and lived
nan to old age in East Feliciana parish,
and near Port Hudson. Her father
bad was inspector general of cavalry, ,
nm- and commanded the detachment
tar- that captured a Federal gunboat i
ned in the Yazoo river. He served
nts with distinction to the close of the
ate war, when he married a daughter
ing of Gov. McWillie, of Mississippi. 1
low Mrs. Howell (nee Kate Cham- I
bers) is the first offspring of this
np- marriage, She spent several years
l11- of her life with relatives in Jack
of son, Miss., where she was promi
on, nent in social circles. In 1890 she
md married J. T. Howell, now of
na- Baton Rouge, and a leading Popu
ing, list and advocate of the free coin- t
for age of silver. Last summer she <
me attended the St. Louis convention c
sh, with her husband, who was a dele
lor gate, appointed a member of the f
w- committee on platform and mom- ,
le, ber of the national executite com- A
es mittee for Louisiana. d
n- In person Mrs. Howell is blonde n
is of more than average height, with c
gm olden hair and eyes of deepest
to blue. When asked to give her im
pressions of the People's party
convention, Mrs. Howell replied :
a "I well remember my sensasions
as I approached the great hall in
VC which the Republican convention
P" had so recently sat. I entered the
er great building with a feeling al
as most of dread, because I expected
to find a meagre assemblage of
3f hay-seeds, with a sprinkling of c
t- seedy professors and disappointed
P politicians from the old parties, a
gathering of which I should feel
ashamed to see my husband a mem- I
ber. Imagine, then, my surprise
f and pleasure when I found the It
largest, most representative gath- .
s ering of respectable American cit
" izenship I have ever seen.
e "Among the members of the -
convention were such men as Ma. TI
rion Butler, the young Senator
from North Carolina, who, as tem
porary chairman, handled the con
vention in a masterly manner; Al
len, of Nebraska, who, as perma
nent chairman, impressed every
one as a man capable of doing
Shonor to the highest office in the
gift of the people (which I hope he
will some day hold); Gunby of
SLouisiana, who, in a short speech
of only a few moments in nomina
ting Watson for Vice President,
took the convention by storm, and
was carried about the hall for ten
minutes on the shoulders of the
Georgia delegates; and a host of
others, grand men of patriotic Im
pulses, whoso very enthusiasm im- I
parted to their utterances almost I
the fire of eloquence in painful I
contrast to the tame oratory of the I
effete time servers who had but re
cently met in this same hall and
made the ticket that my husband a'
had always predicted would be the ,
wnning ticket in 1896.
"While the managers were work- g
ing for time to bring the conven- ae
tion to indorse the Chicago ticket
full rein was given to the delegates,
and many took advantage and made
fine speeche, anid I left the con
vention ball fully impressed with U
the conviction that this young giant a
of the People's palrty was to be
the party of the future, and that
to its hands would be .confided the st
task of resecuing our people from
the trusts and monopolies .that
have ,been created and fostered by ai
both the old parties in this 'free' len,
land of ours for more than a gene= aboi
ration. a
"My people for generations have lars
been Democrate, but they would coni
he astonished if they cooki return of t
here to see what the old organiza- er,
tion had become, and they would d,
be overcome with distress to learn
that the grand old party founded D. c
byJetfferson has rent itself in twain
never again to be reunited. But

A Pardon ! Never!
f "It is reported here that the
Board of Pardons, after consider
ing the case of I)esforges, the con
r vitctd New (hOrlens cuihcilinan,
t unanimously agreed to his rekasc
on the first day of April. We are
" glad of this as he has been an ex
cellent prisoner and evn if guilty
I as charged his punishment has been
I sufficient to atone for his crime."-
Baton Rouge Truth.
In the name of Virtue, Truth,
'Justice, Our Homes, Firesides, and
our God NEVER, NEVER, NEVER !
Oh, Brother McGrath! you brave,
chivalous Southern gentleman, are
you mad? Do you not know that
this man Desforges, is not only a
bribe taker; but a libertine, an
adulterer, a seducer? the destroy
er of a woman's honor, the sister
of his own wife, ruined under their
oown ro~f tree ? If this vulture up
on the chastity tf our womanhood
is to be now free, let the pardoning
board and our governor, for it
will be so considered, boldly make
public, that nothing is sacred from
the demands of politics and politi
cal pulls; and as far as they are
concerned, the virtues of our wives,
daughters and sisters are the legiti
mate prey of politicians. If Gov.
Foster signs that pardon he should
be hu~g in effigy from every court
housein the State. And the par
doning board, not only there,.but
in every .household yard, and their
names denounced and coupled with
contempt and scorn from every
pulpit in the Sdlith.--Shreveport
