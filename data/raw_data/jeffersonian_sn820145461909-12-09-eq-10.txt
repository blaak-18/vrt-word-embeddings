Strong Expressions of Opinion
From the F. U. Boys
(Concluded from Page 3)
with these private letter defences,
and with these explanations sent
through lecturers to be given to pri
vate meetings of the Local Unions?
Is that, the way innocent men act?
John Lee’s talk about brotherly
love behind closed doors sounds very
hypocritical to me. A matter like
this concerns the whole public, and if
they dared to do so they would meet
these accusations in public. It is not
fair to the members of the Farmers’
Union to ask them to believe the
unsupported word of the accused
parties when those statements are
made in private letters and in pri
vate meetings where they can not be
met and refuted.
John Lee knows perfectly well that
no one has been a better friend to
the Farmers’ Union than I have been,
and as long as Duckworth and Bo
denhamer simply antagonized me'
personally, I made no comment; but
when they betrayed the Farmers’
Union to that Republican Ship Sub
sidy League, and when they hooked
up with President Sam Gompers in
his lawless attitude in behalf of the
City Labor Unions, I felt it my duty
to speak out, and I intend to keep on
doing it. As to what John Lee says
about the Farmers’ Union putting
more money into the pockets of the
Georgia farmers “than any politician
has or can ever put,’’ that is mere
nonsense. The big Ikes who made
the Farmers’ Union members hold
their cotton, two winters ago, cost
the people more millions of dollars
than will ever be saved by that Union
City Guano Works, or any other
Union City enterprise.
As to the crack at me, —every R.
F. D. mail-box on the country roads
is evidence of my devotion to the
country people; and to the fact that
I am willing to buck against that
Union City crowd, when they have
got all the organization, and I have
got none, is further proof of the fact
that I will attack anybody and every
body when it comes to a question
of the rights of the common people
of this country.
Very truly yours,
THOS. E. WATSON.
