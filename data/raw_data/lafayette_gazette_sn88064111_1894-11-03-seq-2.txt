.David B. Hill said "I am a
l)Democrat." In four short words the
-great New Yorker told you exactly
where he stood politically. But
when you ask - a bolter how he
stands, he tells you something like
this: "I am a National Republican,
Blut'a State Democrat. On parish
matters I can't exactly say where I
stand, and at a municipal election
ft depends."
We look upon the present fight as
one between the negro party and
the white man's party. The first
and foremost issue is whether this
State is to be Jamaicaized, Hay
tized and mongrelized, or whether
it will remain a free, sovereign gov
ernment, in the hands of the white
race. That is the question that
will be decided next Tuesday.
That is the fight of the day.
VWhether it is to be a government
of white men, or a mongrel govern
ment of whites and negroes.
" A Western editor has become
penitent--:he first case we ever
knew. He says:
"'The undersgined resigns from
the editorial chair with complete

the hour he started his paper to the
present time he has been solicited
to lie upon every given subject, and
can't remember ever having told a
w-holesome truth without loosing
ubsetrillers and making enemies.
Under these circumstances of trial,
and having a thorough contempt
for himself, he retires in or

We know of no editor who is

; iia SC T f G Id a
'e f oloeVing abletletter appeared a
in the Times-Democrat a few days p
ago. It purports to be an answer
to the "open letter" written by Mr.
McCall to Gov. Foster. It is well
worth reading-snd we regret not be
ing able to print it all:
"No power on earth, no "party be- )
neath the sun, cunld fasten a system
,so undemocratic, so unrepublican, g
so unamerican, upon the people of r
this country. Think of it, a single I
individual, Leon Godchaux, receiv- C
ed in a single year a crisp government
check for $437, 744,45! For what?
Because he raised a crop for which (
he received upon the open markets ,
of the world at 3, cents approx
imately $766,o52. His individual ]
gift from the national government ]
represented in amount 33 =-3 per
cent of the entire revenues of the
State of Louisiana from ibs 6 mills
constitutional tax..
"You claim it as a matter
of equity. ",He who .seeks
equity 'ust' do equity" i
is a maxim as old as the common l
law itself. I find upon examination,
that upon your sworn statement
your plantation is worth $1 oo, 75.
You raised upon it last year 7,555,
8oo pounds of sugar, for which the
government gave you a check for
$55 I, t6 xx and in addition, your
product upon the market yielded, at
3 x-2 cents, $264,453 and about the a
same approximate figures main
tained for the balance of you sugar
planters. The banker at Monte
Carlo scarcely realizes higher re
turns on his investment in the wheel
of fortune or upon the turn of a
card. But let us make another cal
culation Estimating the crop of
the present year upon the basis of
that of last year (and it will be
much larger), you leave for seed 2o
per cent of the cane of each year.
That you may go out of the busi
ness and not prove false to your
people, your party and, yourself, I
propose that the government pur
chase your entire plantation outfit
at the sworn valuation fixed by
yourself. Then let the government
grind up this seed cane and sell up
on the market, and it will yield
$66,113. Add to this' the same
rate of bounty which we hope and
believe it will pay upon your other
crop raised, $37,779, and we have
for your seed cane $0o3,892. Now
we propose to make you a present
of the live stock and farm outfit and
turn your plantation back into the
national land department, to be
sold at not less than six bits an acre,
with buildings and improvements
thrown in for lagniappe, the only re
striction or prohibition being that
the pur chaser shall never again
raise another pound of sugar upon
it.

"Now my good fellow, I know
you have been maltreated by the
Democratic party, but if you accept
the proposition I present, all will be
well. My surprise is not that you
forwarded your resignation, for as
an honorable man you would resent
the idea of holding goods under
false pretenses, but my surprise and
mortification knows no bounds that
one whose past life had been such
as yours,.who had made the glori
ous fight for the honor of his State
as you did against the corrupt and
corrupting influences of the Lottery
Company, should have given him
self, and his fortune and great abil
ities, to such a scheme. The lot
tery leaders never so boldly and
defiantly undertook to control our
elections and our people; it asked
for quarter alone, it plead for life,
and dared not to deliver us bound
hand and foot to our relentless ene
mies. Its bribe-was to be applied
to public charities and necessities.
The bargain you expect for deliver
ing the manacled form of your
precious State to the demons, who in
times past, have plundered her; and
picked and pinched her almost
lifeless carcass for the last scant
morsel of flesh and blood, is for
private gain, for individual benefit,
for hard, personal cash. The logic
of your position is that we have
lived a lie, thatColfax and the 14th
of September and all the fierce and
fearful ordeals of the past a-re blots
upon our civilization, and all the
charges, all the accusations of in
justice, of humanity, of persecution
and outrage made by the blood
thirsty orators of the North, all the
charges of the enemies of the past
are true and confessed.
By the provisions of existing law
your people will receive the benefits
of x-22 x-i cent duty on sugar, un
less the wild and senseless action of
your friends causes the repeal of
the faw. Did you realize that one
cent duty means $25 per acre pro
tection? This amounts to more
than the entire revenue receird
per acre, by the poor cotton lan-'
er, and still youa are not happy,

Two or three more meetings like
the one held by the Republicans at
Falk's hall will make this parish al
most solidly Democratic. Some of
our people may believe in the doc
trine of Protection, but very few of
them are willing to see the negro
brought back into politics. This
parish has passed through a terrible
ordeal to secure the blessings of
white government, and the people
naturally look with suspicion at the
demagogue who prates about the
"legal rights of the negroes."
