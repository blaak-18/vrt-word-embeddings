'HATS AND OTHER THINGS.'
Wiass amd armaie Talls the Latest
Smart Garniture.
Among the many modish black bats
(and they are to be the smart wear all
winter) those made of black taffeta
shirred ami' corded are simply charm
ing. You may have dressy ones with a
big rose of any color covering the
crown and the taffeta of the brim soft
ened with tulle, while for forenoon
wear the whole, hat is of taffeta with
big bows across the front and buckle
for ornament
Milliners are becoming large buyers
of the cboicest furs, for they are to
have another season of fur trimmed
bats. As hat crowns and hat brims
ire very much larger than formerly It
takes many more skins to cover them,
and correspondingly higher prices are
asked. But how exquisite is the com
bination of lace, mousseline and crape
with sable, mink, chenille and erminel
The "latest cry" in smart millinery Ii
to have hat facings of wings and of er
nlne tails. The wings show tar a charm
where the brim Is wide with a slight
upward curve, and they produce
charming lines also in their slight over
lapping. Besides combining pure white
with soft grays in the natural state
there are touches of pale rose and oth
er tints Introduced by dyes which beau.
tify the face by a rare becomiugness
in feather softness.
Wings are employed also as collar
and front facings to superb opera
cloaks of velvet, panne velours and
gold brocades.
The hat crown which gives the great
est cachet to a hat is on the melon or
der or, to be politically suggestive, re
sembles the shape of a.mandarin's cap.
These crowns are small and belong to
the flat hats exclusively, which are all
brim.
Long, narrow breasts of game bird
feathers ending in long, stiff wing
feathers trim upturned hat brims
charmingly. These are the correct bats
for tailor made suits. The hat Itself
may he of velvet. Big draped crowns
of tucked cloth to match various suits
are also among the new winter fea
tures of millinery, stilT broad quills
pureed through the cloth answering for
trimming. "Platean" is the namne giv
en to these hats on the other side.
The hats in the sketch are selected
from Vogue. which is also the excellent
authority for the new ideas in fashions

here noted. One Is a directoire bat In
braom gress felt edged with sable and
gold braid, with a twit of bronse
green velvet around the crown, with
buckle of steel and gold at front. A
deep broems ostrich amasen plume at
the left droops over the brim at the
back. The otber Is a theater hat of
better color lace over cream white lib
erty esatin faced with ermine, large lace
bow with jeweled tpuckle at front and
soft rosettes of the cream satin nader
the brim at back; better colored lace

ret loops at the ends.
Loyal we still awe to that toech of
black upon everything. Even the

and the smilest debutante gowns are

unlooked for places and makes as un.
