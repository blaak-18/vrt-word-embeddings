Want Drainage.
To the Earor of The Gazette:
We hope that the committee
lately appointed by the Police. Jury
will give due attention to the volume
of water in the Scott road coming
from the north side of the Louisiana
Western Railroad. Heretofore this
has been criminally neglected. The 1
water can easily be made to run in its
proper channel which is north and
not south of the railroad.
We trust the committee will give I
us relief as soon as possible, as we
cannot travel this piece of road
without running the risk of breaking
our necks or greatly damaging our
vehicles. Let us hope.

Carencro News.
From tOnrReaerl Correspondent.
-A larger number of our citizens,
than ever before took advantage of
the excursion rates to visit New
Orleans and participate in the
Mardi Gras festivities during the
recent carnival.
-Mr. A. Dugal, assistant agent
at the Southern Pacific station here
has been appointed night operator.
-The delay in the payment of
the bounty by the government, has
occasioned much hardship to many
of our planters.
-Taking everything into consi
deration, the bad weather, hard
times, and miserable condition of
the roads, the church fair which
took place recently, was quite a
success. The different tables were
ably managed, and every promise
fulfilled. The "Magic Lantern"
entertainment given by Rev. Father
Dubourg proved very interesting and
instructive. Rev. Father Laforest
the worthy and energetic pastor of
St. Peters church, has informed his
congregation, that the building of
the new church will commence in
the spring. When the new church
is finished, the old one will be con
verted into a school house.
-Dr. F. W. Courtney was called
to Lake Charles on business last
week.
-The parochial school manage
ment in Carencro has a custom of
awarding medals at the end of each
week to the boy and girl who prove
themselves most proficient in their
studies, and also as a reward for
good conduct. Your correspondent
will hereafter publish the names
each week of the successful contes
tents, when he can obtain the in
formation. For the week ending
Feb. 9 Master Harry Lessley was
awarded medals both for "Lessons"
and "Conduct". In the girls'
school, Miss Lizzie Dimitry was
awarded the medal for "Lessons"
while Miss Euchariste Mathieu re
ceived the one for "conduct".
-Since it appears to be a settled
fact that we are not to have any
more roads;'it might not be amiss
for the good citizens of Lafayette
and Carencro to combine and contri
bute their mite towards having the
channel which now exists in the
public road dredged and cleaned;
name the stream "Jury River," and
establish boat service, between the
two towns. ;'There's millions init,"
and besides, we would . be dotted
down on the map, as "sea-port towns."
Oh, it would be so awfully nice. It
would beat a sugar refinery ",all to
" pieces."
--We regret tp learn of the pro
riacited illness of -tr. Louis Roger.

Tuesday to attend an eccnsiastical

J. P,· ISunday.
.--Some timegoa gentIema living
near Ciarencro was greatly annoyed
by stray cattle-entering his premises,
and damaging his property. Losing
all patience, he had the ward cons
table "take up" the most aggravating
one of the lot. He filed his claim
for the damage committed. Asses
sors were named, and a ,"curator ad
hoc" appointed as is customar iA
such cases, the suit was decided
against the cow defendant, and in
addition to the damage claim of
1zo judgement was rendered for $i8 B
accumulated costs.- Immediately
after the ju'dgement was filed, the i
determined.plaintiff discovered that
the cow was his own property, but
he had to pay the $z8 costs all the
same.
"-Hon. A. J. Guilbeau was a
visitor in our town this week.
-Rumor has it that Judgde O. P.
Guilbeau has been appointed agent t
for the "'Calcasieu real estate and.
South Western Investment Company"
representing a capital of $zoo,ooo.
The aim and objects of this agency
will be explained in some future
issue.
-Larencro is still wide awake
and must not be judged by a sleepy 3
or lazy correspondent.
-Mr. Henry Crouchet has made
many improvements around his
premises.
- Street Commissioner S. Brous
sard has had much necessary work a
done on the road leading in a Wes
terly direction from the corporation.
-Both cotton gins in town are
still ginning cotton.

From Our Regular CorrespondenL
-Our boys have all returned, and
from the glowing looks of their coun
tenances. must have enjoyed them
selves hugely whilst in New Orleans.
We are told that one in particular,
made himself rather conspicuous.
-It is our painful duty to chron
icle the unexpected end of Paul D.
St. Julien; one of the rising and
promising young gentlemen of this
parish. The deceased was a personal
friend and fellow student of your
correspondent; and many were' the
pleasant hours passed in his com
pany. A young gentleman highly
educated; of superb character, mild
and amiable in disposition, his death
is certainly one to regret. His
friends he numbered by the score,
an enemy he knew not-to know him
was to love him. We attribute his
rash act to "momentary insanity,"
as he was too intellectual and sensi
ble a man to have taken his own
life. We tender our heartfelt sym
pathies to the bereaved parents, in
this their great affliction.
-Several well known gentlemen,
of whom Messrs B. P. Landry;
Aurelien Primeaux and Aristide
Landry were the leaders, left last
Sunday for- Cheniere Lacroix and
other gulf points. They contemplate
remaining away fifteen to twenty
days. We wish them a pleasant
and safe trip
-Mr. D. Bonnemaison returned
from the Crescent City Saturday,
and with him were the Misses Van
dergrifriaughters of Dr. Vandergriff
an old and esteemed ex-Royvillian,
but now a resident of New Orleans.
These charming young ladies will
be the guests, during their stay in
our town, of Mrs. D. Bonnemaison.
-It is with great pleasure we read,
in the February "Salve Regina"
published monthly by the Dominican
sisters of New Orleans, an
article entitled "My opinion
of the Comedy of Errors" written
by Miss Nita Scranton, daughter of
our popular and well known phy
sician, Dr. G. WV. Scranton. The
article is ably and beautifully written,
an too much praise cannot be given
the author. Miss Scranton gradu
ates from that institution in July
neat.
-lIn last week's "Valley of the
Teche" appears guessing initials
concerning a wedding. We did not
see any prizes mentioned regarding
the answers. Probably we might
bid for a guess, if our trouble in
doing so, would be compensated.
As it is, we will leave it all to our
Breaux-Bridgians, who are apt in
guessing, al great in imagination.
-The postoflice, so long under
the experienced management of Mtr.
D. Bonnemaison, changes hand.
The newly appointed postmistress is
Mrs. T. H. Theriot, a very highly
I educatedlady,thoroughly qualified to
fill the office. No bett&k appoint
