SATISFYING OLD SAM ADAMS
THE STORY OF OUR CONSTITUTION INTERESTINGLY TOLD
In 1776 there was an alliance of
thirteen small states, who fought a
German king then reigning in Great
Britain, in order to make one corner
of the world safe for democracy.
That war came to $ successful term
ination, and then the question be
came a pressing one whether demo
cracy was safe for the world. For
several years there was a situation
closely akin to anarchy. After sev
eral years of uncertainty and near
anarchy, it was decided to try the
experiment of creating a league of
thirteen small nations, banded to
gether to preserve peace and promote
the common welfare. In order to se
cure these ends, the Federal Con
stitution was prepared and submitted
to the States.
Secret Meetings
.The Constitutional Convention met
in Independence Hall, with George
Washigton in the chair. The meet
ings were held in secret, and what
was done was not revealed for fifty
years, when the journals kept by
James Madison were published. It
is well that the people did not know
from day to day what was happening.
It is well that the three great states
of Massachusetts, New York and Vir
ginia did not know how their pre
cious liberties were being tamper
ed with, or they might have called
their delegates home. It was felt by
the convention that if the discussions
were secret, the delegates could
wrangle with perfect freedom, and
if they came finally to agreement
the thirteen states would have only
the agreement to consider and not
any of the material of the debate.
That was fortunate. If the thirteen
states, and especially the three or
four largest ones, had been able to
fling into the faces of their return
ing delegates some of the things
which they had said on the floor, say
ing to them, “Why did you vote for
an instrument of which you yourself
said this?” the thirteen colonies
might have gone to the bow-wows
and the Bolsheviki.
Constitution Submitted
Finally, the Constitution was
adopted by the convention, and sub
mitted to the thirteen / states.
And they all saw what a noble in
strument it was, and hastened to
adopt it?
Not quite in that fashion.
But the great states were first to
see how great an instrument it waS?
Not exactly.
When George Washington went
back to Virginia and submitted the
fruit of his toil, Patrick Henry rose
in heat and shouted, “Even from the
man who saved us by his valor, I
will demand a reason for his conduct.
Why does this instrument say, ‘We,
the people?’ Why does it not say,
‘We, the states’?” And Patrick
Henry was not alone in his demand.
How did the Constitution of the
United States get itself adopted?
On its merits? Well, hardly. Its
adoption was the result of a number
of compromises and of sops thrown
to Cerberus.
Southern States Placated
First of all,* the favor of the
Southern states was secured by giv
ing them more than their share of
delegates in Congress. They were
permitted representation not only on
their free citizens, but a representa
tion, in reduced proportion, on their
slaves. That insured the favor of
the Carolinas and Georgia, and Vir
ginia acted as a kind of stakeholder
in that arrangement; for Virginia,
while a slave state, was represented
in the convention by men who earn
estly desired the end of slavery. The
three states south of Virginia were
determined never to accept the Con
stitution could not have been adopt
ed. So they were first won over by
this compromise. Five slaves were
permitted to count as many as three
> white men, and Georgia and the Car
olinas became advocates of the Con
stitution.
New England’s Bargain.
The next thing was a bargain be
tween New England and the South
by which the new Federal Govern
ment might make trade regulations
for the entire country in exchange
for permission to keep the slave
trade going till 1808. It went hard
with some of the states to give up
the right to impose import duties on
shipments from other states. New
York was determined to make every
Connecticut farmer pay import du
ties on every dozen eggs he brought
to the city to sell, and Connecticut
retaliated by refusing to ship any
firewood to New York. The privi
lege ef having little ecraps like this
was very preeieus to the thirteen
fine and mighty independent states,
and this mean compromise was adept*
By WILLIAM E. BARTON, from the Independent
ed to make it possible for the Na
tional Government to take over com
merce regulations. To her everlast
ing honor, Virginia voted against the
compromise, and did it on the ground
of the iniquity of the slave trade.
It is almost the only large-minded
and righteous act of any. of the
greater states in the convention.
George Mason said, “Every master
of slaves is a petty tyrant. They
bring the judgment of heaven on a
country. As nations cannot be re
warded or punished in the next
world, they must be in this. By an
inevitable chain of cause and effect,
Providence punished national sins
with national calamities.” That was
what Virginia said about slavery in
1787. But New England and the far
South made the bargain, and it went
hrough against the protest of Vir-
Tinia. The convention hoped that in
twenty years slavery itself would
end.
Small States Dissatisfied
But still the Constitution could
hardly have been carried. And so an
arrangement was made to secure the
p avor of the smaller states by giv
ng them equal representation in the
Senate with the larger states and
naking legislation impossible with
out concurrent action of both bodies.
That bought over Rhode Island and
Delaware and other small states
'though Rhode Island backed out of
he bargain), and without this noth
ng could have been accomplished.
?ot our noble Constitution could not
have been adopted by the farseeking
and unselfish leadership of the great
states. All the states, large and
small, were too petty, too jealous, too
selfish, too prone to ask how their
ocal interests would be affected.
So the proposed Constitution was
submitted first of all to Congress.
Whose voice was first raised regard
ng it? That of Richard Henry Lee,
vho eleven years before had moved
"he adoption of the Declaration of
Independence. Did he move to adopt
he Constitution? He did not. He
organized the forces to oppose it.
Who stood next to him ? Nathan
Dane, the able leader of the delega
ion from Massachusetts. And who
lext? The solid delegation from the
rreat State of New York. They
•vere not going to have any league
if nations.
Big States Hold Out
For eight days the three! great
•tates of New York, Massachusetts
and Virginia tried to obstruct the
neasure, and they were past masters
n all the arts of obstruction. But
at length the Congressional vote
vas taken and the Constitution was
ransmitted to the several states.
Pennsylvania was first to ap
prove it for submission to the vote
for a Constitutional convention. She
•arried it by a vote of 46 to 19 in
ier Legislature, which had but one
bouse. As 47 were necessary to make
a quorum, and the minority deter
nined to defeat the Constitution by
staying away, two members of the
minority were taken violently from
heir rooms and forcibly held in their
ieats in the Legislature, where, mut
tering and used bad language, they
were compelled to sit during the brief
apace of time required for the vote,
which went through, 45 to 2. In
his dignified and far-visioned man
ner did the first State Legislature go
an record in favor of the new league
if nations.
Bitter Campaign
Then followed stump speeches,
namphets, caricatures and vilifica
tion, which it more instructive than
edifying to remember. What need
had the Thirteen Colonies for a new
Constitution? Were not the Articles
if Confederation good enough for
is? Had we not under them whip
ped Great Britain? And who were
these men who were trying to cut the
Thirteen Colonies loose from their
well known policy and send them to
certain wreck in their folly? Wash
ington—who was Washington ? A
rood general maybe, but what did he
know about politics? There were
not lacking those who openly de
nounced him as an old fool. Aa for
Hamilton, he was a believer hi mon
archy hnyway. Franklin was an old
dotard, who had come hack from
France to bring us into bondage to
European ideals.
And how was the new government
to work? There would have to be a
president, doubtless; and what was a
president but a puppet king?
If one of the states got into trouble
must another state get her out? If
Rhode Island continued to muddle
matters as she always had deae, must
Massachusetts stand sssysusMaf If
Delaware went te war mast New
XOn BClia 80K2IQT& vO M6lw Mrs
Lee Heads Opposition
Pennsylvania had been first to ap
prove the Constitution for submission
to a convention. But it was done,
as will be remembered, against the
protest of two gentlemen held for
cibly in their seats and fifteen others
locked in their rooms and refusing
Co come out and vote. These prot
astants organized a oppo
sition, and Richard Henry Lee, of
Virginia, became the leader of it; for
Pennsylvania would be the first state
whose convention would vote. Then
-oee James Wilson, whom we have
almost forgotten, and met the filibust
ering and obstructive measures with
•aim reason and skilful parliamen
tary procedure. While Pennsylvania
was held up in this fashion Dela
ware hurried a vote and approved the
Constitution and New Jersey fol
owed; but not till Pennsylvania,
forced to vote, adopted the Constitu
tion by a two-thirds vote of 46 to
?3. Only nine states out of the
thirteen were needed, and one-third
if them approved in December, 1787.
To be sure, James Wilson was
hanged and burned in effigy for
vhat he did, and the almanac for
1788, containing the text of the new
Constitution, was publicly curst and
burned with due ceremony in divers
and sundry places in this free and
enlightened land.
Georgia, already committed to the
measure by her slave representation
ind the privilege of importing neg
roes for twenty years, ratified the
Constitution on January 2, and Con
necticut, grateful that New York
could not tax her potatoes and that
she had as many senators as Mas
sachusetts, followed just a week
later. ;
Massachusetts Yields
Massachusetts was the first of the
'arge states to come in. She came
with great travail of soul! In her
constitutional convention were,
among others, twenty-four ministers,
and to their everlasting honor they
were among the most intelligent and
progressive men there. But it is
doubtful how the matter would have
?one had not old Sam Adams changed
his mind. He sat for three weeks in
the convention and never opened his
mouth, and when he finally spoke it
was to utter three words, “I am sat
isfied.” On Febuary 6, 1788, Massa
chusetts ratified the Constitution by
a very narrow vote of 187 to 168,
becoming the sixth state to ratify.
Maryland came in on April 28, and
New Hampshire’s convention met,
hut timidly adjourned till June to see
what the other states would do.
South Carolina ratified in May, and
New Hampshire met again in June
and ratified, Virginia following after
a* long and bitter debate, making one
nore than the necessary nine states.
Most bitter was the controversy *in
New York, where Hamilton won a
related victory with a small majority
if 30 to 27 on July 26.
Petty as were the large states, the
small ones, which had most to gain
iy the union, proved even more petty.
North Carolina did not ratify until
George Washington had been Presi
dent for some months and Rhode
Island became one of the United
States of America, May 29, 1790.
Had she waited just a little longer
Vermont, which was not one of the
original thirteen, would have gotten
in ahead <of her. For a year and
more it had been Rhode Island über
alles; but Rhode Island came in,
with many misgivings for her pre
cious rights, having so many sacred
interests to guard that she needed
two capitals, Providence and New
port.

TUB CALL OF THE NORTH
A MAN THERE WAS
-K-K-K
WHO’S THE MAN? WE WILL
GIVE YOU ONE GUESS.
—K-K-K
A man there was who toiled with
his hands and paid the price of
sweat and weary limbs and climbed
the ladder inch by inch until men said
he was the richest man in all the
world. This man was ridiculed with
out complaint or protest and all the
foolish things men said of him were
turned to shining coin. He cashed
cheir jokes and put them in his bank.
They called him ignorant and a fool
and still he smiled and added to his
iaily balance.
For this man made a useful thing
chat common men could use. He
placed upon the market of the world
ois wares and those who toiled as
he had toiled found that they could
possess, use and enjoy that which
he had builded and in acquiring, they
need not pauperize themselves or
take the bread and clothing from
cheir wives and children. He left the
gloss of finery for other builders. He
courted not those full-pursed men
who spend their money on their pride
and tax themselves for ego’s sake.
He built that men in overalls might
buy.
He Grew Rich in Money and in Love
And as he builded larger every day,
ne paid his workmen a wage that
honest mep should pay to honest men.
The toiler in his shop could well af
ford to eat a mid-day meal, fit for a
man who toiled. And that same man
could with the setting sun bring to
his family a wholesome steak, a bag
of fruit, a book to read or any other
needful thing that those who sweat
and toil in great America should
have. The workers in his spreading
factories were not slaves. They
were his partners. They shared the
products of their toil. And thus he
grew, not only rich, but in the
hearts of men.
Some criticised. He gave no uni
versities to the children of the thou
sands he had robbed. He did not rob.
He founded no great libraries for the
people who were able well to build
3uch institutions for themselves. He
much preferred to pay a living
wage, so that his workmen might
hold up their heads and read a book
without accepting charity. He paus
ed not to endow a soup line. Those
who had labored for him or who had
bought his wares had not been forced
by their transactions with this man
to patronize the, public bowl of soup.
His was a policy that would let men
'ive and live without the blush of
shame that comes with charity. And
vet, the millions piled upon each oth
er, while fortune smiled and luck
played ever to his hand.
Men Made the Man
For somehow men will work in
honest fashion for such a man. He
shared his gold with them, not as a
gift as an earned reward, and they
in turn gave to his enterprise the
best they had in brain and brawn.
\nd ’twas this combination that turn
ed the very joke upon the corner of
the street into a shining piece of
gold. Thus fairness on his part made
every man beneath him fair. Thus
right enthroned within the palace of
his business policy caused every man
who entered to- want to do the right.
\nd thus the men this man was mak
ing made the man.
And so today those who by tens of
thousands have toiled for him and
those who by the millions have
bought from him are forming one
nation-wide and most gigantic plan
to make him President of this Re
nublic. No politician looks his way.
The party leaders do not want this
man. Those who have selfishly con
trolled this nation for a score of
vears are trembling at the thought.
But some strange thing has pripped
the nation’s heart and men are won
dering if this builder might not in
deed build up a mighty country on
that plan and with that same result
that has made famous far and*wide
his spreading factories.

DESTINY OF THE PDBUC SCHOOLS
AMERICANS. UNSHEATH THE SWORD OF INTEREST FROM THE RUSTY
SCABBORD OF DANGEROUS INDIFFERENCE
(From “The Protestant,” Published at Washington, D. C. Gilbert O. Nations, Editor.)
The public school is the most typi
cally American institution ambng us.
It is the chief foundation of the Re
public. Our national destiny depends
on the continued growth of a school
system already marvelously efficient.
In the early life of the first Eng
lish colonies in the present territory
of the United States public education
was provided for all children. As
the settlers penetrated the forests,
scaled the mountains, poured into
the Mississippi basin and swept
across the continent, public schools
were everywhere established and sus
tained.
Children of the hardy pioneers
were gathered into the rural schools
and molded into intelligent, upright
and homogeneous citizeship. The
spirit of the nation was fashioned in
the democratic atmosphere of that
invigorating school life. There boys
and girls received the inspiration to
mount the ladder of achievement to
ts upmost round and render true and
asting service to their country and
the world.
There the foundations were laid in
science and literature and art and
industry and statecraft. Pupils in
those schools drank deeply from the
Bible and from textbook* uncensored
by alien propagandists the imperish
able lessons of moral and spiritual
integrity. So was the national char
acter established on a superb and“en
iuring basis.. " ,
Development of School System
As virgin resources and boundless
drew into the West a
growing tide of enterprising settlers,
rural neighborhoods and villages
were quickly transformed into great
municipalities. In consequence city
graded school systems were develop
ed with peerless equipment and
facilities from the kindergarten to
the high school.
To meet the demand for teachers
if the highest professional training
and efficiency, normal schools and
teachers’ colleges .were established
by the States and their number and
equipment was increased to keep pace
with the growing demand.
Able* and scholarly superintendents
were employed to direct the city
school systms and advance them to
the highest possible degree of effi
ciency, while state and county su
oervisors rendered like service to the
village and rural schools.
By* the middle of the last century
the admirable public school system
and the expanding problems of a
great and versatile nation accentuat
ed the demand for higher education
on a broad and liberal scale. Be
ginning with Harvard,* William and
Mary’s and Yale, endowed colleges
and universities had occupied the
early colonial days. But the field
had widened so rapidly as to require
State institutions to supply its de
mand.
Hostility Toward our Free
Schools Came During Mid
dle of Last Century
Immigration that poured into our
country shortly before the Civil War
from Ireland and other Roman Cath
olic lands was hostile to public edu
cation. It marked the beginning of
the campaign that has continued
three-fourths of a century to discred
it and break down the public schools
and supplant them with schools char
tered by the papal throne and operat
ed like those of Mexico and South
America.
But the nation responded to the
defense of our own school system.
The struggle quickly became spirited
on both sides. It was instrumental
in producing the American or Know-
Nothing party in local and national
politics.
The national spirit of that party
reinforced by the exigencies of the
Civil War moved the Federal Govern
ment in 1862 to appropriate portions
of the public lands for the endow
ment of state agricultural and me
chanical colleges. Similar grants
had long been custonfery for support
of the rural, graded and high schools
maintained by the respective states.
Thus did the nation place its abund
ant resources at state disposal to es
tablish higher education and research
in the fields of agricultural and in
dustry. Colleges for that purpose
sprang up in all the states. Many
of them have since developed into
splendid universities whose endowed
resources are supplemented by liberal
state appropriations.
So has the public school system
esvarsd the whole field of education
and rssareh. The curriculum! ex
tend from the kindergarten and the
primary school te the most advanced
universities courses, and ample facili
ties are at hand to offer the most
thorough instruction and training in
the science and art of teachig.
Civil War Diverted Public
Attention
The Civil War diverted public at
tetion from Roman Catholic man
euvers against our public schools.
Under cover of that diversion the
hierarchy projected its own rival
system in every part of the country
and boldly demanded public funds
for its maintenance. That demand
is urgently pressed in Roman Cath
olic lands is generally conceded.
Not content to develop on our soil
a rival system chartered by the Pon
tifical throne and teaching the papal
doctrine of divine right to rule, emis
saries of Rome lost no opportunity
to emasculate and discredit the pub
lic schools. To that end the Bible
was everywhere ' removed from
curses of study and its reading in
the school room was prohibited.
Textbooks were then censored and
every fact of history discreditable to
the papal despotism was thoroughly
expunged. From the school readers
all selections from the Scriptures
and those lessons designed to in
culcate moral virtues and to extol
the heroism of American patriqts
and of the martyrs of the Reforma
tion were systematically excluded.
Objection was made to the singing
of sacred and patriotic hymns in the
mornng exercises. So was the spirit
of American and of Christian civili
zation that has made America glori
ous banished from the public schools.
A visit to the schools by any citizen
of mature years or comparison of
textbooks now in use in reading and
history classes with those in use a
generation ago will demonstrate the
changes wrought by hostile Roman
Catholic power. " I
By covert manipulation Roman po
liticians have wormed their way into
boards of education and city and
rural school superintendencies and
there used their official power to re
move the most worthy and efficient
teachers and fill their places with an
appalling number of Roman Catholics
bound by the canon law which out
laws public schools and forbids chil
dren of Roman families to attend
them. &
Concentrated' Efforts Made to
Destroy our Public Schools
Having thus debauched and de
vastated the public schools to the
limit of her power. Rome is using
the controlled press and her own
three hundred peridicals to discredit
them with charges of irreligion and
inefficiency. Her malicious asper
sions deserve the condemnation of all
good citizens.
The Papacy hates public education
Its law denies the right of civil gov
ernment to educate the people.
There is no education where Rome
has enough power to dominate the
government. Public schools are dis
tinctively Protestant institutions.
They are not found in any Roman
Catholic land except in the form of
a miserable counterfeit depraved by
Bishops of Rome who reign in the
midst of illiteracy all but universal.
The school issue in this country
has reached its crisis. We are at
the parting of the ways. We must
decide whether American children
shall be educated in American
schools or in the alien schools of
Rome. Millions of unassimilated
aliens crowded into our cities and
millions more that are coming to our
shores every decade necessitate a
speedy and final decision.
In spite of their emasculation at
papal hands while the nation slept,
our public schools possess marvelous
efficiency and unbounded potentiali
ties. Purged of Roman poison and
restored to their pristine virility and
power, they will quickly Americanize
the alien Roman Catholic hordes in
our cities, exalt in the public con
science the majesty of law and prove
a mighty factor in the solution of the
grave problems confronting the na
tion.
To that end the childhood and
youth of the Republic must be edu
cated in those schools. The text
books and teachers must be imbued
with the highest ideals of civic duty
and patriotism. The schools them
selves must breathe the loftiest spirit
of the nation and its homes and
churches. They must typify the
choicest fruit of Christian civiliza
tion.
Twenty-three years ago the nation
had endowed public education with
land grants aggregating 86,188,433
acres, being an erea of the public
domain exceeding the whole extent
of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. Tha
people have augmented the splendid
imperial endowment with hundreds
of millions of dollars in state and
local taxation. All worthy citizens
agree that no educational facilities
are too good for our boys and girls.
Power of our Free Schools Must
be Enhanced «
But the power of the public schools
must be steadily enhanced. They
must continue to place the highway
to a liberal education equally at the
door of the cottage and the mansion.
Mediocrity and genius must alike feel
the thrills of school life backed by
the wealth and character of this
great unselfish Republic.
The menace and disgrace of illit
eracy must disappear. The aliens
that gorge our eities and industrial
centers must be educated and Amer
icanized. The physical status of the
rising generation must be pushed to
the highest degree of perfection. A
million of our most worthy and ta
lented youth must be thoroughly
trained to teach in the public schools
and saved to the profession by ade
quate salaries.
Textbooks as well as tuition must
everywhere be free. Attendance of
eligible children must be rendered
universal by adequate compulsory
regulations. Pending legislation im
Congress must be enacted to place
the resources of the nation securely
back of the most cherished and vital
of all national interests—the deve
lopment of American citizenship and
personal intelligence and moral
worth.
Here is a task worthy of every
true son of the Republic. It appeals
to the noblest ideals of the citizen,
the home and the nation. Every ob
stacle must be removed or overcome.
The public school system of the Unit
ed States must become the most ex
cellent that American genius and en
terprise can produce.
DON’T QUIT
When things go wrong, as they some
times will,
When the road you’re trudging seems
all uphill,
When the funds are low and the
debts are high,
And you want to smile, but you have
to sigh,
When care is pressing you down a
bit,
Rest, if you must—but don’t you
quit!
Life is queer with its twists and
turns,
As everyone of us sometimes learns,
And many a failure turns about
When he might have won had he
stuck it out;
Don’t give up, though the pace seems
slow—
You may succeed with another blow.
Often the goal is nearer than
It seems to a faint and faltering
man;
Often the stmggler has given up
When he might have captured the
victor’s cup;
And he learned too late, when the
night slipped down,
How close he was to the golden
crown.
Success is failure turned inside out—
The silver tint of the clouds of doubt.
And you never can tell how close you
are,
It may be near when it seems afar;
So stick to the fight when you’re
hardest hit—
It’s when things seem worst that yen
mustn’t quit.—Anonymous.
