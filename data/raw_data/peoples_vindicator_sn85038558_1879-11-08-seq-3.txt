ast ,atnr.ay. Sunday snd Monday,
there were very imposing and soleman
eeremonies in 8t. Franies Cathedral, on
the saoniversari of All Saints and All
Souls days. Saturday and Sunday large
numbers of the citizens of all classes via
islted the cemeteries. The Catholie
burial ground, was thoroughly put in
order, most of the tombs whitewashed,
the earthern mounds covered with white
sand, and the graves ornamented with jo
flowers, wreaths and souvenirs, clearly p1
indicating that the living remembered TI
the dear ones who have passed away.
The Protestant cemetery was also via- the
1 ited and large numbers of the graves or- mad
namented, but it neeus much work to Ilow
clear away the briars and undergrowth. C
This annual remembrance of the dead ing
by the living, is a mentbeatifl eaustom, Cm
and yearly grows in popularity. It the
makes the living llng more fondly to eld
r the memory of the loved dead, and de- hoer
sire that they too may be thus remem- ter
* bered when they have passed from the Wor
shores of time, out into the broad ocean
j of eternity.
