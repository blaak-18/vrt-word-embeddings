work,
Last Wednesday Mr. Ilornsby tiled his
petition on "reductionlof bail." His hon
or give him a hearing on the sme day,
After the examination of witnesses, Mr.
Hornsby informed the court that be had
used all diligences to give bond ; had
paid out all his funds dispatcbing depu- h
ties to have his friends get him out of
the "cooler," but that the plea they all
put in was that his bond was too high. I
He also stated in his argument .hat be
had been driven away from home and
that be had sacriticed all his means on
account of divers diseases he contracted
while in prison and hoped his hbonor
would reduce his bond to $100 His
honor replied, that he had placed his
bond at the very lowest figures, and that
if he yielded to reduction of bonds that
that would be making thbe question of
bond a farce, and therefore could not t
grant him his request, and ordered the
Sheriff to take charge of the prisoner.
Mr. Hornuby no doubt thinks that his
failure of giving bond is a hollow-mock
ery on American freedom, at least we
should infer so, from the following peti.
tion hepnakes to the court : e
Your petitioner J. R. Hornsby wishes
to inform your honor that he was arrest
ed in New Orleans illegally and contrary
to law and justice by one McDonnal
special officer, by virtue of a warrant di
rected to D. II. Boullt, jr.,sheriff of Nat
chiroches, which said McDonnal had no
right to execute under the law, and
your petitioner claims that he has been
illegally arrested and illegally perseau
ted under the laws of this State in the
Parish'ofOrleans from the 16th Decem
ber, 1878, to February, 1879, and your
petitioner did petition to you for the re
moval to Natchitoches prison where he
might give bond and thereby get his
liberty according to law and justice. And
your petitioner was ready to give the
amount of bond required by your honor,
and owing to the minutes of your court
being out of place by the neglect of some
parties not known to your petitioner to
forward any warrant back to this parish
as should have been done. Your peti
tioner did spend several dollars by din
patching to your honor to ascertain the
charge against him through Mr. W. W.
Breazeale, and you referred him to the
minutes of the court which could not be
found at the time, nor any warrant. Mr.
W. W. Breazeale acting as sherifat the
time of my transfer from New Orleans to
this place forwarded a blank bond to my
friends for their signature which t~ey r
fused to sign on accoant of sad bond not
being filled out which cost your petition
er to spend several dollars more for the i
service of a deputy and your petitioner
requested the bond to be filled out wbieh
was done with the charge of"assault
with intent to kill," and as I had writ.
ten to my friends the charge was
"an assaunlt with the intent to commit
murder," andl as there was no particular
term of oourt for my appearance, my
friends have returned the bond and re
fused to sign it. Your petitioner having
exacted all his means in trying to give
the large amount ot bond required, and
having seen parties released from tbhisL
prison on much smaller bend with graver
chargie than b prefered against e, ask
youar honor to reduoe my bond fom $350
to $100 s I have friends to sign the last
amount; and your petitioner wishes to
toinform your honor that he il a law
abiding eitisen and a native of Loaus
lana, prays that your honor give the
above petition your earliest attention,
and grant your petitioner a hearing.

SMILE. pI
a
Lacoste's Hall was again crowded with t
Natchitochee' "fair women and brave s
men" on Thursday evening last to do B
honor to our distinguished fellow towns
men M. J. Cunningham. Esq., and Hon "E
C. F. Dranguet, sufferers in the eause of
liberty and Saxo ncivilization. Mr. Cnn- ni
ningham has proven the trust reposed re
him by his friends beyond their most
sanguine expectations; their most ar
dent wish. If unseltish devotion to his tl
people; untiring efforts in their behalf aI
merits reward, the honors extended to
Mr. Cunningham by all clauses of citi- fr
zens is but a poor mark of esteem. a
The hero of a musket ; the brave wear- a.
er of a private's uniform on Virginia's ni
bloody selds during our struggle for in- C,
dependence, he has show bimselfas fully lo
able to represent his people in court as t
in camp.
Mims Ida Bouard on the part of the ladies
presented Mr. Cunningham with a mag
nifcent bouquet of emblematical flow
era, blended with exquisite taste by Mrs.
A. F. Lemee. The bouquet was capped
by a small banner with appropriate de
vices--rossed swords on one side and
embroidered violet on the other-and du- Il
ring the delivery of Miss Buard's address *
our hero was crowned withlaurel wreath. h
Mr Cunningham accepted the bouquet, ,
with that modesty and grace which die-a
tinguish the te trugentleman, and spoke f
as follows :
Mis e arsd and Ladiei'of Natciteoce :-
I receive these beautiful owers, the em- n
blems of purity and honor, in behalf of s
the prisoners recently on trial, and ten
der you our heartfelt gratitude for the
encouragement given by you in our re
cent troubles, and for this testimonial of
your appreciation of our services. Next
to the approval of my own consciousness
of having discharged my duty bonestly,
conscientiously and to the best of my
humble ability, the approving smiles of l.
our fair country-women constitutes the o
highest recompense for a public service. v
Women, noble women I last at the croses,
first in the performance of all good f
works. Without her loving smile the
earth would be a desert, and without her
encouragement and her approbation man u
would have no incentive to exertion. I
I have too much modesty cnd too litt'e
appreciation of my individual merit, to
appreciate this flattering compliment to
myself. I was accideutall' prominent in
a great cent at, and I receive thbis laurel t'
wreath as a crown of victory for a great
principle, the cause of liberty and of
free government, which was recently on
trial. The verdict of acquittal was a
grand victory not alone for the idivi
fdals oa trial but for the great pri
ple involved. We have been for years
engaged in a ItE for the malntenance
of civil libert ans ood government, of N
which the orl trough which we have
recently passed was an episode; we have ri
but discharged our duty; we have not P
Ieen animated by any motives of self
aggrandisement; and it we receive the
approving smiles of the fair women of
our land, and the approbation of our fel- I
low-eitizesa, we will be fully compen- u
sated for all tronuble,annoyance, expense I
and risk to which we have been subjaect
ed. c
After this address was eoneluded Ma

We congratulate our City govern
ment upon the excelleut selection of
officials made by them on Wednes
day last: W. E. RAnsell Esq., was
elected City Tar Collector, W. H.
Barbee Esqe, City Secretary and
Treasurer, and Frank Raggio Esq.,
City Marshal:'
We understand that our new City
government propose the adoption of
new and wholesome regulations for
our government, to inagaurate im
provements on our streets, and to
substitute a system of proper drainn
age for the present expeasive "town
ditch."
While on this subject we beg to
call the attention of our enterprisaing
citizens to the fact that Councilman
Ducournan has prepared an Ordinance
relative to street Lampe, and we
would urge all those who desire our
city lighted I to put up the necessary
Posts and Lamps.
It is to be hoped, also, that the
streets in the rear of the city will be
"side-walked" with plank, as we
suggested some months asince. It will
not only be of incalculable benelt to
the residents of that portion of our
town, but will give value to a large
area of city lots now worthless, be
cause inaccessable in bad weather.
In fact, we hope to ee great things
from the City Government, as they
are young men, and they must show
their faith by works.
