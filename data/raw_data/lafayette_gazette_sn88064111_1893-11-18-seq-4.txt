KENNEDY'S
MEDICAL DISCOVERY.
DONALD KENNEDY, OF ROXBURY, MASS.,
Has discovered in one of our common
pasture weeds a remedy that cures every
kind of Humor, from the worst Scrofula
down to a common Pimple.
He has tried it in over eleven hundred
cases, and never failed except in two cases
(both thunder humor). He has now In his
possession over two hundred certificates
of Its value, all within twenty miles of
Boston.
A benefit is always experienced from
the first bottle and a perfect cure is war
wanted when the right quantity is taken.
When the lungs are affected it causes
shooting pains like needles -passing
through them; the same with the Liver or
Bowes. This is caused by the ducts being
stopped, and always disappears In a week
after taking it. a
If the stomach is foul or bilious it will
cause squeamish feelings at first.
No change of diet ever necessary. Eat
the best you can get, and enough of It.
Dose, one tablespoonful in water at bed
time. Read the Label. Send for Book.

3'n. imost,41kbry mU her41b cod
:vi la d furnishih conclusive edv
deaoe that th.fautlt is in the man and
not in the: soil. The great troublde b
hind all of this is in the universal die
position to plant more land thancan be
properly cared for.
The southern farmer isagiven to "big"
things, and his standing israttd by the
number of baled of cotton his planta
tion ships to market annually. There
is very little land in the cotton belt
that will not (properly managed) pro
duce from 400 to 600 pounds of lint cot
ton in fair seasons; yet we see the aver
age falls below 100 pounds for the en
tire acreage.
The lands of the Yazoo Delta will,
with good cultivation, produce 500
pounds of lint cotton or fifty bushelsof
corn per acre, yet the average given
for this section is about 200 pounds of
cotton and twenty bushels of corn.
Riding over the country, one fre
quently sees a fine -crop of cotton and
corn, belonging to the same tenant,
while on the same kind of soil, in the
same inclosure, will be seen another
crop scarcely worth preserving.
Inquiry will reveal that in the first
instance the tenant has just what he
can attend to carefull, while the other
is badly over-cropped, and necessarily
loses in yield. It is possible for the
southern farmer to bring up his land
to a paying point by a judicious course
of rotation. The cow pea furnishes a
cheap and valuable soil renovator, and
the average southern farm can be re
stored to profitable production by the
use of cow peas alone.
A trial of this will convince the most
skeptical. It must be understood that
no crop should be plowed undcr green
in our warm climate, but it should be
left until frost has killed vegetation
and then turned under, or do it in the
winter. (January being the best time.)
In this section, vegetation is so rank
that after June 1 it would be almost
impossible to plow under this rank
growth, in fact, it can hardly be done
in the winter, as the dead vines, weeds
and grass on vacant fields, are frequent
ly six to twelve inches deep, and must
be removed before the land can be
plowed. This is usually accomplished
by burning, a practice that should not
) be resorted to, if possible to avoid.
If our farming friends would learn
that it is much more profitable to take
only so much land as the means at their
command will justify, and give to that
the best attention in the preparation
and after cultivation, they will soon
cease complaining that farming does
not pay. Competition, even in the cot
ton-growing business, is dri ing the
limits of profit down to very narrow
margins.
We are told that revolutions never go
backward, therefore we must adapt
ourselves to the new conditions, or drop
out to make room for those who do. In
a few years more cotton production
will be carried into many countries that
have never before grown it. That the
United States can defy all competition
in this line I think certain. We can
produce cotton cheaper than other
countries by using improved labor
saving implements. The "picker'
will be forthcoming when the
time demands it. When it does, cot
ton will be produced at a cost of three
cents per pound. At present, pine cot
ton, grown by the old methods, has
ceased to be profitable. We must pro
duce 500 pounds per acre to realise any
profit This can be easily obtained on
Yazoo Delta lands, properly cultivated,
and can be done without resort to use
of artificial fertilizers. -More attention
must be given to the pteparatiotn of
the soil before the seeds are planted.
Depending on the rains to pulverize
the cloddy land is a makeshift method.
A slow but sure method pays better in
the end. Quality of the article mar
keted should receive more attenition.
Quantity, without regard to quality,
requires more labor, more expense,
and certainly sells for less. Special
brands, once established and kept up
to a high standard, would become a
"trade mark" that would pay to keep
up.
There are several varieties of cotton
in cultivation here, that most in use
being the short staple, a prolific va
riety, and is always in demand at
.prices quoted in our daily papers. The
Peterkin and Taylor are mostly grown
in the county. Medium staple such as
Griffin, Southern Hope, Eureka. and
some others are also planted. They
are not quite so prolific as the shorter
staples. Cook and Allen are the stand
ard fancy staples; the first named is
decidedly the best paying of the two.
These fancy varietics are bought up
by thread mills and used for making
spool thread (for sewing.) They sell at
a premium over the other cotton,
ranging trom two to five cents. This
article would be too long if the sub
ject was followed to the enid. I defer
it.-W. I. Collins, in Practical Farmer.
MUCK AS MANURE.
