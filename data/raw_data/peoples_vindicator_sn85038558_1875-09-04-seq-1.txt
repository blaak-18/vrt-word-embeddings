RisV 0.z-ua racuturt e as applied
to the two great staples of Louisiana
is to abbreviate the cultivating seat
son by t asteniug the .riod at which
the crops pre "lat 4 bt'. or, is othlr
words, copsigned to the bnalided care
of nature. Expefl'i e has shown
that in proportion.!iti 'this period is
hastened the value of the: harvest is !
ephanced, and. it therefore followq i
that as white libor imparts intelli
gence and efficieiucy _ to the system of I
agticnlture the pursuit of that ludns- I
try till become better adapted to the
constitution and physical eriditiibsh
of white men. The best. crops are
those which are laid by earliest in the
summer, and the judicious didtibu'
tioh Qf labor necessary to this' end' is
what white men are mosat t to plaln
and carry out. On a wel.l anbasged
plantation, nine years out U( ten,
there need be'an field labor, per forole
'cd between the pst of July and the
middle of September, or between the
.middle of June aid the first of Septi
tember, Danring that hierted tero,'
which is supposed y to be so fatal to
white men whose ooempations expose
them to its rigore, the amoet vital in
terests of.the crop require that cul
tivation shoQa4 be 'suspended. Ac
cotldlengl a' this rlae is pbserved the
reward of agticultre are augmented.
The poorest crops are those in which
misfortune or mismanagement has
prolonged the cultivating season. The
best crope are those i~ti *ich scien
tific and intelligent administration
has brought that season an early close.
Perhaps thefiuest cane field in Louis
ians to-day-and we have heard ite
said that there was never a finer one
at any time in the past-is to be seen i
