Os this book Mr. Watson says: “In
order that editors, speakers, lecturers,
and voters might have in the conven
ient storehouse of one volume all the
scattered information now contained
in many; and in order that they might
have a brief statement of the line of
argument which we adopt upon all es
sential issues, I have written this book.
I have endeavored to fill it to the brim
with facts, important facts, undisputed
facts. I have tried to make it an ar
mory from which reformers can draw
every weapon of offense and defense.”

Letters From The People
BRYAN AND THE CONFEDER
ATE SOLDIERS.
Decoy, Tex., Aug. 26, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: After respects, I will
state that I rote to the Hon. W. J.
Bryan a letter of enquiry about his
refusing to vote for an ex-Confeder
ate soldier in 1891, while he (Bryan)
was a member of Congress. I wrote
him that I was an ex-Confederate sol
dier and would like to know the facts
concerning the reports that he (Bry
an) did refuse to vote for an ex-Con
federate* soldier. I called his atten
tion seeially to Alford Henry Lewis’
letter showing that he (Bryan) threw
away his vote rather than vote for
an ex-Confederate soldier. W. J. B.
did not answer my letter, but sub
stituted another Bryan. He did not
answer any questions that I qsked
for information upon, but substituted
a clipping from the Washington Dis
patch to the St. Louis Republic,
which was reproduced in his (Bry
an’s) paper, The Commoner. I en
close both Bryan’s substitute letter
and clippings. You can use th®m as
as you see proper. With
for right to prevail over am
as ever, an advocate of equal rights
to all and special privileges to none.
Very respectfully yours,
WM. A. KILLERN.
(Note: Yes, Bryan dodges those
questions.
In the Democratic Caucus, voting
behind closed doors, Bryan refused
to vote for Mills or Crisp because
they were ex-Confederate soldiers.
That is the reason which he gave to
Alfred Henry Lewis for throwing
away his vote on Springer, when
Springer had ceased to be a candi
date and was, himself, voting for
Crisp.
After Crisp was nominated by the
Caucus, Bryan voted for him in the
House, because he had to.
Bryan has never denied what Mr.
Lewis charged concerning his vote
in the Caucus, nor has he ever denied
the language attributed to him by
Mr. Lewis.)
307 Waldburg Street West,
Savannah, Ga., Aug. 24, 1908.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Thomson,
Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson: In your speech
of acceptance you say: “Believing
as we did, we had to fight. Honor,
self-respect, patriotic convictions were
imperative—we had to fight.”
Is the word “believing” the right
word to use in this connection?
Would not the word knowing be the
proper word?
We knew that our rights under the
Constitution were ignored; we knew
that aggression after aggression, and
injustice after injustice are perpe
trated upon us, and made fighting im
perative.. I would ask you to call to
the attention of some thoughtless
voters who have expressed the inten
tion to vote for Mr. Taft, that by
voting for him they vote for 'the
nominee of the party which stands
for negro social equality; for the re
duction of Southern representation in
Jeffersonian
Congress; for the abolishment of the
tew State Rights left to us; for the
continued reign of plutocracy; for
monopolies in restraint of trade; for
the classes against the masses; for
trusts, etc. Every vote by a South
ern born white man for Mr. Taft is
traitorous conduct to the South and
will be a twin crime to . traitorous
conduct to country in time of war.
You are so true to our people; and
are held in such high esteem by us
all, an editorial by you, as asked
above, would have very great effect.
If one will not vote for you or Mr.
Bryan, but votes for Mr. Taft, he is
a Republican at heart, though he does
vote for Democrats in local elections
sometimes.
Yours truly,
M. R. TUNNO.
INFORMATION WANTED.
Daisy, Georgia.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: We saw in the Jeffer
sonian the other day where a tramp
had been locked up in Oregon. We
had a relative go off to trust a new
locality and anyone giving us infor
mation of him will be well paid for
their trouble. He was not a tramp,
but as honest and straight a man as
could be. His name is Marshall R.
Moore and he was born and raised
in Tattnall county, Georgia. He is
of ordinary size, dark complexion,
black hair, eyes and mustache, and
had with him when he left money
which he had worked very hard for.
Very truly yours,
J. H. MOORE.
A DISADVANTAGE.
In Southampton, Mass., not long
ago a prominent man of the place
was commending the improvements
made by a certain grouchy citizen
with respect to his dwelling.
“Your house looks a whole lot bet
ter now that it is painted,” said the
prominent citizen.
The pessimist, who was at the time
standing in front of the premises,
looked up with glowering brow at the
newly decorated exterior.
“Well,’’ he admitted, gloomily, “it
does look a bit better; but we’ll have
to wash the windows twice as much
now to dress up to it.”—Harper’s
Magazine.
A NON-CONDUCTOR.
A teacher in an East-Side school
was trying to explain some of the
simpler phenomena of electricity, and
at the close of her little lecture she
asked sweetly, “Now can any of
you children give me the name of
some non-conductor and tell us about
it in a few words so that we can all
understand?”
A sharp-eyed street urchin jumped
up and down in his seat, waving his
grimy paw frantically. “I kin,
teacher!” he exclaimed. “Billy
Hogan’s old man is one. They was
a spotter on his ear seen him knock
down a fare. Old Hogan’s a non
conductor ever since.”—Lippincott’s.
