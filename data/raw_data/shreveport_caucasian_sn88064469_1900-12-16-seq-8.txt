the City Council was convened Thura
day night in adjourned session, His H ,nor,
Hon Ben Holsman, mayor, presiding.
Dr J C Egan, president of the Sjreve.
port Board or Health, sugested the
advisability of instituting a system for toe
inspection of milk, and submitted a reso
lution therefor which bad Deen drawn by
the city attorney and the sanitary commit
tee of the Bosri of Health, and hat been
adopted by the Board of Health. The
ordinance provides for a milk inspector
and the condemnation of adulterated milk
or milk from diseosed cows, and milk
faidng to reach a spesitic gravity. The
Inspector is to receive a fee of one cent per
cow or Inspection.
Action on this ordinance, which was
opposed by Councilmten Wagner and Crain
and favored by Counoilman Mabry, wes
deterred until January.
The joint committees-street lignting
and franchise committees-through Coun
cilman Berunteln, re orted favorably on
the Did of the Shreveport Gas. Electrio
Light and Power Company, with the
condition that twenty five additional
lights be require4, and the right is
reserved to the city to locate and change
any or all the lights. The report of the
committee was accepted and the contract
was awarded unanimously to the company
named for a period of five years, beginning
at the expiration of their present contract
which will expire in
An ordinance by Mr Alston, providing
Ire esoapes for certain buildings in the
city, was adopted.
A ccmmittee of the Industrial league
A Cuirle, Chas C McCloud and C Scott
DeLay-submitted a memorial, which was
read, and in which is suggestea the exten
sion and improvement of Commerce street,
as being the most economical route to the
Hargrove Cotton Mill. The proposition
was viewed favorably by the Council.
Councilman Mabry called attention to
the fact that the meat ihspector's salary in
fees amounted last month to over $ 17S,
which is a larger salary than was intended
when the cebedule was adopted. A lively
discussion followed. during which the in
spoction was criticised and provoked the
risibles of the Council and spectators*
Action was deterred.
The Council having considared other
business, was adjourned to Wednesday,
