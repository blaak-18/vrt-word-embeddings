3 A Narrow Escape W. Claude Martin
LD MAN THOMPSON’S gro
cery store was a favorite
gathering place for all the
men of the little village of
0
who didn’t have anything to
do but discuss the weather, the pros
pects for a crop and the political situ
ation. I happened to be one of that
number, I am sorry to say, but it
gave me many an opportunity to hear
a good story. One day we were seat
ed in front of the store whittling on
Thompson’s goods boxes, talking of
everything and everybody that we
could think of and, incidentally, tell
ing a few stories just byway of keep
ing things lively. One of the boys
had just finished telling an absolutely
impossible bear story, when old man
Thompson came out of the store and
seated himself on a pickle barrel.
We could all see at a glance that
the old man had something on his
mind, so settling ourselves in the
most comfortable position possible
we waited patiently for the story we
felt sure was coming. Presently he
cleared his throat several times, as
was his habit before speaking. Said
he: “I just heard that yarn one of
ye wus a tellin’ about a bear an’ hit
reminded me of a little fracus I got
into once, in my young days. I wus
goin’ to see a little girl that lived
four or five miles from where I did
an’ I most always arranged things
so’s I could go over to her house
ever Sunday an’ kind o’ hang around
till 10 or 11 o’clock at night an’ then
walk back home, arrivin’ there long
about 12 or 1 o’clock. I had been a
goin’ to see her some time an’ had
got to where I liked her so well that
I begun to dress up considerable so
as to win her favor by my good looks,
you know. I bought me a biled shirt
an’ a standin’ collar, an’ a turkey red
necktie an’ a long-tailed coat. She
said I looked awful dignified an’
handsome in my new rags. Os course
I thanked her as polite as I could an’
told her that I was sure I didn’t look
more’n half as good as she did. I
guess she took that as a compliment.
Wall things wus a progressin’ as nice
as could be expected, so one Sunday
night I decided that the time had
come fer me to speak. I stayed till
midnight a tryin’ to get up courage
enough to pop the question, so the
said question failin’ to pop I decided
that it would be best fer me to wait
an’ tell her of my great love fer her
the next time I seen her when I could
have more time. So takin’ my hat
I bowed my way to the door. As I
wus a goin’ down the steps she says:
‘I hope you’ll get home without any
thing a happenin’ to ye.’ I says,
‘What happen to me?’ She says,
‘Oh, nothin’, only pap said that some
body seed a bear in the swamp a
day or two ago. Good night.’ An,
with that she shut the door. Now I
had to go right through the swamp
she wus talkin’ about to git home,
but I never thought much more about
the bear till later on. When I got to
the swamp the moon had done gone
down behind the western hills, as the
feller says, an’ everything wus dark
as Egypt. There wus a creek runnin’
rite through the swamp an’ the only
way a pedestrian a walkin’ afoot
could git across without wadin’ wus
to walk a foot-log. Wall, everything
went well till I got to the foot-log.
I hadn’t much more’n stepped up on
it when I felt somethin’ shake it.
The thought that it was a bear struck
me quite forcible, and that if it wus
one that it would be tickled to death
to meet me for I thought that very
likely he hadn’t had any meat fer
some time. I stepped off again to
kind o’ meditate on the situation. I
begun to think what if I should never
see my happy home agin. I thought
some, too, about how the folks at
A
Wi
H«. w.re a i.wj faiteA. e, 6 ,
home would weep great scaldin’ tears
an’ call me a brave boy when they
found me an’ the bear dead in each
other’s embrace, as the feller says.
Fer you know I meant to die a fitin’ if
that bear did happen to interfere
with me. This thought made me
weep a little bit myself. I just
knew that when my body wus found
that I would be buried under a moun
tain o’ flowers an’ be honored as a
hero. This made me shed a few
more weeps, but I decided that I
would go on anyhow, dead or alive,
so wipin’ my misty eyes with my new
red bandaner handkercher I started
across the foot-log with fear an’
tremblin’. I hadn’t got more’n half
way when the log shook again, an’
before I knew it I had fell off into the
creek. I wouldn’t a hated that so
bad if it hadn’t a been fer my long
tailed coat, fer I didn’t want it to
draw up no worse’n it was. You bet
ter reckon I got out perty quick,
though not as quick as I got in, of
course. I hadn’t more’n got out,
though, ’fore somethin’ begun to
make a pantin’ noise right behind me.
I forgot about how I wus a goin’
to slay that bear an’ I started up the
road like a locomotive engine. The
Jeffersonian
reason I didn’t run no faster’n I did
wus jist cause I couldn’t. I never
have been able to run that fast any
more. Somehow that night my feet
wus kind o’ unloosed, as the feller
says, an’ all I lacked o’ flyin’ wus jist
havin’ wings. All the time that pant
in’ sound kept right up behind me.
I didn’t have time to look back, but
with my mind’s eye I could see that
bear two or three feet behind me
with his eyes a blazin’, his mouth
open a disclosin’ his monstrous teeth
an’ his tongue a hangin’ out as he wus
a pantin’ fer breath. On I flew like
the wind, as the feller says, but al
ways that pantin’ sound wus rite be
hind me. Run fast as I might an’ I
couldn’t outrun it. I kep a thinkin’
that the bear would surely get tired
out an’ stop, but it kep right on about
the same distance, behind me. I
reached up to get my hat, but it wus
gone, an’ my hair wus a standin’
right straight up an’ I couldn’t make
it lie down. All the time that darn
ed old bear wus a pantin’ steady be
hind me. I tried to increase my
speed but it wouldn’t increase none,
an’ perty soon I could tell that in
place of increasin’ it wus a decreas
in’. It seemed that the bear’s speed
wus a decreasin’, too, which wus
lucky fer me, fer he didn’t seem to
gain on me a bit. All the time I
kep a lookin’ fer him to grab me by
my coat tails an’ lovinly place his
paw around me an’ squeeze the livin’
life out o’ me, while he proceeded to
eat his hard earned breakfast. But
the slower an’ tireder I got the slower
an’ tireder he seemed to get. Finally
I got so blamed tired an’ tuckered
out, as the feller says, that I jist
didn’t see how I could go any further.
I seen that I wus might near home,
but I wus that give out that I seen I
couldn’t go any further, so reachin’
in my pocket I got out my jackknife
an’ openin’ it I suddenly stopped an’
turned around. Wall, sir, I felt as
though I could crawl through the eye
of a extra small needle, fer there
wasn’t a thing to be seen anywhere.
I begun to look all around fer bear
tracks, but there wasn’t none to be
found. It wus plum clear to my
mind that I had been runnin’ fer
nothin’. I kind o’ eased my feelin’s
by sayin’ a few gentle words that I
never learned at Sunday school.
After my spell had sort o’ wore off I
begun to look around fer the thing
that caused that pantin’ noise. An’
what do you reckon it was? Wall,
sir, I found out that it was them
gosh darned old coat tails a rubbin’
an’ floppin’ agin’ my wet pantaloons.
I never went to see that girl any
more I wus so grieved. She said it
nearly broke her heart when I quit
goin’ to see her, but perty soon she
married another feller. What did I
do? I sold that blamed old long
tailed coat.”
