Sedge of the ribs. increases on pres
sure; sometimes the pain is in the left
side; the patient is rarely able to lie
on the left side; sometimes the pain
is felt under the shoulder blade, and
it frequently extends to the top of the
shoulder, and is sometimes mistaken
for rheumatism in the arm. The stom
cll is: affected with loss of appetite
and sickness; the bowels in general
are costive, sometimes alternative with
lax; the head is troubled with pain,
acc6mpanied with a dull, heavy sen
sation in the back part. There is gen
erally a considerable loss of memory,
accompanied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done. A slight,
dry cough is sometimes an attendant.
The patient complains of weariness
and debility; he is easily startled, his
feet are cold or burning, and he com
plains of a prickly sensation of the
skin; his spirits are low; and although
he is satisfied that exercise would be
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely
summon up fortitude enough to try it.
In fact, he distrusts every remedy.
Several of the above symptoms attend
the disease, but cases have occurred
where few of them existed, yet exam
ination of the body, after death, has
shown the LIVER to havebeen zt en
sively deranged.
AGUE AND FEVER.
DR. C. McLANE's LIVER PILLS, IN
CASES or AGUe AND FEVER, when
taken with Quinine, are productive of
the most happy results. No better
cathartic can be used, preparatory to
or after taking Quinine. We would
advise all who are afflicted with this
disease to give them a FAIR TRIAL.,
For all bilious derangements, and
as a simple purgative, they are un
equaled.

And where were you just now, Mabel ?
Where have you been so long I
The moon is up, and all the birds
Have sang their evening song ;
I saw you loitering down the path,
8o lonely and so late.
Beyond the well and lilac bush,
And hanging by the gate.
I love to hear the birds, mother,
And see the rising moon ;
And, oh ! the summer air is sweet
Beneath the sky of Jane.
My cow is milked, my heas re cooped,
And washed are cup and plate,
And so I wandered out awhile,
Tohang upon the gate,
The gate is by the road, Mabel,
And idle folks Fo by,
Nor should a maiden brook the glance
Of every stranger eye.
Besides, I thought I saw a eap
I'm sure you had a mate;
So tell me who was with you, child,
Just banging at the gate.
Now you know just as well, mother,
'Twas only Harry Gray,
He spoke such words to me to.night,
I know not what to say;
And, mother, oh ! for your dear aske,
I only bade him wait ;
And msayp't I run and tell him now t
He's hanging at the gate.

ACCIDNTALLTY INNOCENT.
No lawyer likes going Into court
rwith a toroughly bad cane-yet
how can he help it sometimes?
I should have more patience with
the question, "Do you thinks it right
to defend a man whom you believe
to be gullty ?" were It les frequent
y asked by people who spend
si days of the week seeking to get
the upper hand of their neighbors,
and the seventh to elroumvent their
Maker. To the honest inquilrer I ,
commend the answer Dr. Johnson ,

lawyer is not the judge." I

The New Orleans T'im of a late
date contains the followlng article
regarding "'Suw . FaUs," whieh we
commend to our people as excellent
advise:
Now that the rultural resoures
of the South are b nin to awaken
an interest In the minds of enterpris
log men throughout the country, it
may not be amiss toremind some of
the "land poor" planters that now is
a good time for them to divide their
lae places p into smallfarms. ItIs
impossible for a great mny of our
large landholdes to cultivate their
pilntatione, and owlas to this fact,
there is a vast amount of some of the
very best farinog land ina the stte
otf louslisom now lylog idle. In a
little while it will be covered with a
second growth, whleh will take time,
labor and money to eut down. Now,
wne tbak the best thing our planters
ean do is to divide their immensM
fields ointo smaller tracts, Ia order so
put then within the power of the
enterprisng and inadostrious clasw

comet South nd nlavest their moaey
