WORTH FIGHTING FOR.
A Hint or Two for Oar Statesmen Gath
erest at Washington.
The legislators from the back coun
ties who for years have been trying to
snake themselves solid with their con
stituents by securing $1,000,000 appro
priation for the purpose of making
Mlud creek navigable for ocean steam
ships now have something new and
worth while to work for.
The improvement of so-called water
ways has occupied a great deal of the
legislators' attentionr and consumed a
"heap" of the people's money.
Transportation by water is a right
good thing. So is transportation by
land. A few people desire to cross the
high sea. Most everyone desires to
travel the highways.
It has dawned on the minds of people
that it is worth while to have good
means for getting about the country.
A splendid highway is a great artery
of commerce and pleasure.
The legislators who do the most to
provide means for improving the raods
will come the nearest to the hearts of
their people.
There is nothing chimerical about
good roads. They are a practical, eco
nomical investment. The legislator
who succeeds in inducing the state to
spend money for improved roads need
have no fear of an uneasy conscience.
He can go to bed and sleep just like a
lamb.
Let Mud creek dry up and blow away
if it wishes to. Or Bullrush bayou get
so dusty a clam can't cross it. What do
legislators care! Good roads are the
things the people are after. And
they'll get them, too.--Good Roads.
TOO CONSERVATIVE.
Why Some Dlrymen Grow Wealthy and
Some Remain Poor.
A dairy farmer of our acquaintance
is a wise old man, and say many good
things. lie uses a silo and makes
money in all his farm operations. He
has a neighbor who barely makes both
ends meet, who is bitterly opposed to
the silo, because, he says, it is too ex
pensive. Speaking of this neighbor to
ur old friend one day, we expressed our
surprise that he could not see the dif
fence in profit between his poor meth
ods and Uncle John's good methods.
"He ought to sec," we said, "with half
an eye that hie is wrong antd you are
right. What is the matter with him ?
Uncle John took an extra hitch in the
slack of his breeches, and replied: "Oh,
nothing much, except he is so dead
stuck on himself, and the little he
knows, that he can't see over his ovwn
little ant hill. lie has got more pride
and conceit than sense, and I never
knew a farmer to make a cent on his
conceit. Such nmen will straddle clear
over a dollar to pick up a dime. Hie
commenced talking against the silo
when Ifirst built one, and now he thinks
folks would laugh at him if he should
let up. Mly cows are my guide in this
silo business. I can't afford to kick
against facts; he can,tnud so I keep still
and let him go on. Hle was over to tar
-row ome money ot*me the ,ther day,
and I suplpose I will have to let him
have it. If it wasn't for such men mort
gages would be mighty scarce."

COMBINATION MANGER.
It Possesses mang Good Poinate -luot Aen
soune Dsessdvtatges.
In the report of nmy visit to Crystal
Spring farm I spoke of the feeding man
ger in use there. It-has some -features
that are valuable. The sheep cannot
waste their feed, nor can they get the
hayseed and chaff in their wool.
The accompanying cut shows an end
riew, with the boards across the ends of
troughs and manger rensoveti The end
frames should be mate of 3x3 sticks 4
feet long. Mortise them into each other
1S inches from the lower endsw, maling
the manger angle 35 degrees. For the
troughs use 10-inch boards 1/4 inches
thick. Place the back trough board be
neath the -legs as shown in the cut.
They should join at the top, at the
point marked T. The outer wings of
the troughs can be put on as in making
an ordinary V-trough, only that the
lower edge of the one will have to be
beveled somewhat. Care needs to be
taken that the outer boardof the trough
does not project far enough to invite
sheep to stand upon it and eat over the
top of the rack.
The manger is boarded tightly from
the top down to within 6 inches of the
bottom, this forming the feeding space
through which they must eat their hay;
iThe troughs below catch all the fine
particles and the refuse. The manger
may be made of lighter boards. The
rack may be made any length desired.
Troughs of this size serve well for feed
ing ensilage and roots.
The objection to this rack is that it
is very heavy and does not serve very
well for feeding corn stover either
whole or cut.--H. P. Miller, in Ohio
Farmer.
GARDEN AND ORCHARD.
Manure should be applied to the
grape vines in the fall, so that it may
leach into the soil during the winter.
It will also act as a mulch.
Now is a good time to cut out all use*
less, weak or spindling wood, on the
fruit trees. A twig that can be cut
with a knife now may require a saw
next fall.
Handle the fruit intended for long
keeping as tenderly as possible, and no
more than is strictly necessary. Pick
ing into bushel baskete will make the
handling easier.
One advantage in manuring tbe
orchard late in thle fall is that the
manure will begin its. work, aud early
next spring, just when the trees will
most need it, it wvill be there.
In packing apples for market un
usually large, file apples should be kept
separate, and forim an extra fine quality
to sell at fancy ,prices, preserving unl
formity in size asmuch as possible.
The object of pruning a vine is to
concentrate the growth and productive
capacity of the plant upon the fruiting
of'a comparatively few buds, and not
spread it over a great length of vine and
numerous buds.
Apples will endure a much lower
temperature than will potatoes. The
cooler they are kept vwithout freezing
the better. VWhen stored in cellars
good ventilation is necessary, and as
even a temperature as possible.
When the ground is frozen an inch or
two deep is the best time for putting
mnulch on the strawvberry bed. It is not
necessary, nor even desirable, to cover
the leaves completely, but to cover the
ground around and among the plants.

CANADIAN STATESMEN.
Uew They Aet While Attendlng Their
Duties to I'arlrsmest.
It is a mistake to think that the act
which led to the confederation of the
various provinces in 1807 has attained
no higher meaning in the life of the
Canadian people than that of a consti
tutional union. It carries with it a
meaning of far deeper import-a union
of hearts, whose offspring is oneness
of patriotic aim and purpose. Of
course it would be idle to say that the
Canadian people are a unit upon all
questions of vital interest to the life
and growth of the dominion. The geo
graphical interests of Canada are so
varied that there must necessarily be
at times some friction and clashing of
provincial needs and ambitions. This
is the case at Washington; this is the
case, too, in so small a confederation
as the cantons of Switzerland.
A stranger visiting the gallery of the
Canadian house of commons is struck
with the dignity and decorum which
mark the proceedings and surround
even the warmest and keenest of de
bates. Parliamentary procedure being
rigidly adhered to, there is little room
for unseemly encounters, which usu
ally grow out of uncalled-for person
alities in the heat of a discussion.
Sometimes, however, when the house
has been sitting for hours, wearied
with the prolixities and incoherencies
of some member from "way back,"
suddenly, as if through unity of des
peration, the usual dignity of the
house is relaxed, and grave members
from such intellectual centers as Mon
treal and Toronto play the schoolboy
and outvie one another in "shying"
blue books at the heads of slumberlng
and inoffensive members. Of the two
hundred and fifteen members that
make up the house of commons, in
point of ability and gifts, twenty per
cent. of them are below mediocrity;
twenty per cent. of them occupy the
plane of mediocrity; forty per cent.
possess admitted ability, and the re
maining twenty per cent are men of
commanding talon t.-Donahoe's Mag
