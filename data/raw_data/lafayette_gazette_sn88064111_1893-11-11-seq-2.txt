our schools need, beyond
i tions, beyond good teach
beyond capable surpervisors,
d an energetic school board
capable superintendent is,
Boston Herald, the cordial
of the people at large. In
re of the duties of life
all people the school is one of
 e things taken for granted. With
famitly are constantly being deter
ibated by the pressure of business
and society, the public school is
continually being loaded down with
duties and demands which weigh
."i ,lpon conscientious teachers, espe
miary the large-minded and large
h..,-"hearted women, who are the soul
.;, and strength of our public schools,
and it is increasingly difficult to
educate young people up to the pro
per stdhdard in the knowledge of
what they ought to know, and up to
a proper appropriation of the rela
tion of conduct to life. This is
where our public school teachers
cannot be too earnestly or too warm
ry supported by those who put chil
dren in their hands. It may be too
much to ask the busy men and wo
men who believe in the public
schools to take an hour now and
then to visit the schoolrooms and
show by their presence that they
stand by this or that teacher ; but
wherever this is done-and in many
places it is done-the results far
more than compensate for all the
trouble which they compel. If there
is any one class of unappreciated
people in the community-unappre
ciated and yet deserving of the high
est honor-it is the men and women
who are our faithful servants in the
public schools.
TALMA GE ON SIIIPPI'NG TO
NE IV" YORK.
Messrs. Dan Talmage's Sons in
their last advice drops a "pointer"
not to ship Rough Rice to New
York at present, which we think of
general interest.
Messrs. Talmage state :
Since writing mn September, the relative
position of the New York market, as coin
pared to the south, is greatly changed.
Prices have advanced but not at same pace
so that for the present, at least, you can net
more for your rough rice by selling at home
or in New Orleans. We note this lest you
might ship to us and meet with disappoint
ing results. This turning away ot business
may seem strange but is our desire that every
planter shall sell at the best possible price.
Later on our market will undoubtedly resume
its normal and advantageous position of
which, you may rest assured, we will give
prompt advice. Ve are trying to work up a
trade for rice straw. May not add much to
your income but every little helps. What
can you bale and deliver for, per ton, on
"board cars.
The latter suggestion is excellent
and worthy consideration of every
planter. Rice straw is now regard
ed as of little or no value and here
opens the possibility of making a
market for it. At the start results
might not amount to much, but
even if they were small, would it not
pay to employ idle moments, and
idle stock in getting it ready for and
to market ? The Talmage firm are
on the alert and show a lively inter
est in everything that pertains to
Rice.

From the Jennings Times we clip
the following:
"'Alexandria has purchased ten
patent fire extinguishers, which are
said to be very etfective in subduing
fire. We believe our town council
should look into the matter of pro
viding some such means of protec
tion against fire. The machines
cost only Sxo each, and by prevent
ing a single fire the cost of ten ma
:c hines would be saved many tim. s
eover. "
As it would cost only $xo to test
its usefulness for the purpose indi
e ated, The Gazette entertains the
.-belief that, that amount spent by
diae town council in a public trial of
e ne of these machines would not be
os;,-~"red money thrown away.

OOD APPOINTMENT.T
Leon Jastimnaki. has
by Ike President
r.¢ Ebria To judge
rcab# Stae epress it
s e to assume -that:this . appQint
mneit meets with general approba
tion. The gengeal is one of the
ablest- and most popular editors in
Louisiana, and was for a number
years the president of the Louisiana
Press Association, and being one
of the founders of that organization.
He was, many years ago, a resident
of this town, and is well and favora
bly remembered by many of our
townsmen. His father, Dr. Vin
cenit Jastremski, was a practising
physician in this section, and had
a very large clientage. The Gazette
congratulates the general on his de
served recognition.
If there were were needed an ad
ditional argument to show the utter
uselessness of the circuit court, as a
necessary appendage to our judi
ciary, it is found in the session of
that court held here Tuesday. There
was just one case on the docket.
If any one interested in the pros
perity of the town of Lafayette
would only go out to Lombard's
switch, then to Mouton's switch,and
note the number of cars being load
ed with cane, destined for shipmeut
to refineries, east and west, he can-.
not fail to come to the conclusi on
that a central refinery here is of
prime necessity to develop our dor
mant wealth.

COLUMBIA RICE MILL
NEW YORK,
We beg to call attention to the
fact that we have commenced mill
ing for the new season. Planters
who propose shipping rough rice
to be milled on toll---will do well to
write us as to the amount they are
likely to ship and the probable date
of shipment. This will enable us to
place same on our mill roster and
by the turn being thus engaged, im
mediate attention secured as soon
as the rough is received.
Holders of old crop will do well
to send it right along before the new
crop makes it "take a back seat."
Do not mix the old and new to
gether as they mill differently and
they both suffer.
Care should be taken to pack in
good strong bags, also to mark
plainly that lots may not get m.xed
with others coming to us by each
incoming steamer.
