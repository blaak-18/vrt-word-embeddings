Senate—Met at noon; adjourned at
7 P. M.
Senator Walsh, Montana, ranking
minority member of the Teapot Dome
naval oil reserve investigating com
mittee, called up his resolution di
recting the President to begin pro
ceedings to cancel the lease, put in
virtually the entire day outlining the
evidence developed by the committee
and criticising the Republican admin
istration.
Chairman Lenroot of the commit
tee read into the Congressional Rec
ord the statement issued by President
Coolidge Saturday night previous
outlining the administration’s deter
mination to proceed with court action
to annul the oil leases. Senator
Lenroot denied any advance informa
tion of the committee’s action had
been given to the President and told
the Senate he saw the President’s
statement early Saturday evening be
fore the committee’s executive ses
sion was held. Senator Pepper,
Pennsylvania, corroborated this, and
said he saw the President’s state
ment Saturday afternoon.
A letter signed by E. L. Doheny
offering to return the California lease
if the government will reimburse his
company for funds spent in develop
ing the government oil reservoir at
Pearl Harbor, was laid before the
Senate.
Chairman Lenroot declared the
matter before the Senate was too
serious for senators “on the other
side” to attempt to make political
capital out of it and added that the
tone of the speeches that had been
made indicated political gain was
what is being sought.
Senator Robinson replied that the
statement of the President issued
Saturday midnight on its face “was
designed for political purposes.”
Senator Heflin, Alabama, intro
duced a resolution charging R. E.
Creager, Republican national com
mitteeman for Texas, and others had
exercised “political influence with
Postmaster General Will Hays and
Attorney General Daugherty to stifle
an inquiry into alleged land frauds,
and demanded an investigation. The
matter was referred to the Public
Lands committee.
Action on the nomination of George
B. Christian, Jr., to be a member of
the Federal Trade Commission, was
postponed for two weeks on the pro
test of Senator La Follette, who has
it in for the former secretary of the
late President Harding.
House—Met at noon; adjourned at
4:35 P. M.
Passed and, sent to the Senate a
resolution appropriating SIOO,OOO for
employment by the President of spe
cial counsel to conduct prosecutions
in connection with the leasing of
naval oil reserves. Majority Leader
Longworth introduced the resolution
and it was favorably reported from
the appropriations committee after
less than ten minutes’ consideration.
Minority Leader Garrett endeav
ored unsuccessfully to have his reso
lution designed to bring about can
cellation of the Teapot Dome con
tract considered but Chairman Sin
nott of the Public Lands committee,
to which it had been referred, blocked
this effort.
Democrats and Republicans joined
in adopting the resolution authoriz
ing the special appropriation, but an
attempt of Mr. Garrett to have it
stated in the resolution that Presi
dent Coolidge had expressed his in
tention of turning tpe whole question
over to special counsel rather than
have the Department of Justice han
dle the case, was rejected by a vote
of 136 to 126.
Many bitter speeches were made,
the Democrats attacking the admin
istration and the Republicans defend
ing the President against the charges
made by the Democrats.
Mr. Garrett called on the President
to name a single Democrat, in office
or out, who is suspected of any il
legal act connected with the naval
oil reserve.
“Pll name one,” replied Republi
can Leader Longworth.” “His name
is Edward L. Doheny, who has been
an ‘angel’ for the Democratic party
for years.” Over in the Senate, Sen
ator Brookhart of lowa, declared that
Doheny had contributed $76,000 to
the Democratic campaign fund.
Ways and Means committee agreed
upon a reduction of 25 per cent in
taxes on earned incomes up to $20,000
and all incomes under $5,000 were
classified as earned, for the purposes
of this reduction. Also rejected a
proposal which would prohibit hus
bands and wives from dividing their
incomes for purposes of taxation, as
allowed in eight states.

him to do by resolution.
DAILY INDEX OF
AMERICAN CONGRESS
‘*'*• * J* .
President Harding’s action in trans
ferring control of the oil reserves
from the navy to the interior de
partment was defended by Senator
Willis of Ohio, who declared that he
“knew that man well enough to know
that he never would have taken any
action knowingly or willingly in vio
lation of law.”
Senator Willis also announced to
the Senate that President Coolidge
as soon as he was advised of the
character of the testimony of Archie
Roosevelt, ordered former Secretary
Fall, then in New Orleans, placed
under surveilance by department of
justice agents to prevent him from
leaving the country.
Attorney for former Secretary Fall
came before the Senate committee
telling-of the serious .illness of Mr.
Fall and asking that he be exam
ined in his sick room. Special phy
sicians were sent to examine and re
port on his condition.
Senator Wheeler, Montana, intro
duced a resolution declaring it to be
the sense of the Senate that the
President should immediately request
the resignation of Attorney General
Daugherty.
Under the terms of a resolution by
Senator Walsh, Montana, the Secre
tary of the Interior would be direct
ed to begin proceedings at opce to
establish title of the United States
to sections 16 and 36 in the limits of
naval oil reserve No. 1 in California,
now held and operated by the Stand
ard Oil company of California.
The Agricultural committee favor
ably reported a bill known as the
Norbeck-Burtness bill providing fin
ancial relief for farmers in areas
stricken by crop failure after adding

rison, Mississippi, for farmers gener
ally instead of merely wheat farmers.

America’s war history in the aircraft
failure.”

Military Affairs committee he
thought it unnecessary for himself or
any representative to appear before

Wednesday, January 30
Senate—Met at noon; recessed at
6:15 P. M.
After an all-day debate on the
naval oil reserve lease question, vot
ing began on amendments to the
Walsh annullment resolution. All at
tempts to modify or alter the terms
of the resolution were rejected. Re
publican insurgents voted with the
Democrats.
Leasing of the oil reserves was
vigorously condemned in heated
speeches on both sides 'of the cham
ber. The efforts of the Republicans
were confined to attempts to soften
the language in the preamble of the
resolution, but the combination of
the Democrats and insurgents stood
solidly for the original text.
Senator Couzens, Michigans, ar
gued that the language employed in
the act of 1920 relating to the oil
reserves, passed under a Democratic
administration,' was “exceedingly
broad” and that Congress could not
escape some! of the blame.
Senator 'Sterling, South Dakota,
said he resented the insinuation
against the late President Harding
for his executive order, and added
that “while he may have been mis
informed, there can be no question of
his motive to serve the best interests
of the people.” '
Dr. John Wharton, personal physi
cian of former Secretary Fall, and
three consultants, told the investigat
ing committee that ,Mr. Fall is on the.
verge of a nervous collapse and un
able to leave his sick room to tes
tify before the committee. * Three
other disinterested physicians were
appointed by Senators Smoot and
Walsh to make an examination of
Mr. Fall. £
House resolution appropriating a
fund of SIOO,OOO for the prosecution
of the oil cases was reported from
the appropriations committee of the
Senate with an amendment that the
attorneys selected must be confirmed
by the Senate.
House—Met at noon} adjourned at
6 P. M.
Various topics were discussed, the
bill under consideration being one to
install a broom factory at the Leaven
worth penitentiary, which was passed.
. Democrats accused Attorney Gen
eraf'Daugherty of incompetency and
also lambasted Secretary Denby.
Republican members replied, charg
ing the Democrats with attempting
to make political capital out of the
oil reserv/case.
\ v.". *
Representative Cable of Ohio, ask
ed for an investigation of the change
that large financial interests Were
seeking to defeat soldier bonus legis
lation. '
Democratic members in caucus set
tled a party controversy by naming
Representative Cullen of Brooklyn,
for a disputed vacancy on the new
committee to handle veterans’ legis
lation.
A reduction of probably 25 per
cent in the personal income taxes for
1923 and payable this year was de
cided upon by Republican members
of the Ways and Means committee.
Rear Admiral Latimer, judge advo
cate general of the navy, told the
Naval Affairs committee that in De
cember, 1921, he informed Secretary
Denby it,woqld be Jegal to.enter intq
a contract with the Doheny interests
for the construction of tankage at
Pearl Harbor as a part of their lease
of the California naval oil reserve.
Jle said he based his opinion on au
thority granted the department by
Congress in June, 1920, to exchange
oil and providing for storage facili
ties, which authority, it was brought
lout, was granted at the request of
Secretary Daniels.
Thursday, January 31
Senate—Met at noon; adjourned a
5:20 P. M.
Passed the Walsh resolution for
annuliment and cancellation of naval
oil reserve leases and incidental con
tracts by a vote of 89 to 0.
Prior to that action Senator Tram
mell of Florida, attempted to add an
amendment denoanding the immediate
resignation of Secretary Denby, but
fearing it would delay action on the
major proposals Democratic leaders
persuaded its author to withdraw the
amendment.
The Robinson resolution demanding
the immediate resignation of Secre
tary Denby was taken up immedi
ately after the Walsh resolution was
disposed.
Democrats united in an attack on
*
the Secretary while Republican reg
ulars lined up in opposition to the
resolution, although there were indi
cations of sufficient insurgent Repub
lican votes to adopt it. In his speech
Senator Moses of New Hampshire,
emphasized the fact that if there had
been wrongdoing on the part of any
cabinet officer the only course Con
gress could pursue was through im
peachment proceedings.
The Postoffice committee favorably
reported a bill for experiments over
50 rural routes of a government farm
products express.
The committee investigating prop
aganda voted 4 co 1, that it had full
power to question those connected

Postoffice departments.

preparations to take up without de
lay the Walsh oil lease reserve can
cellation resolution.
Rear Admiral Latimer told the
Naval Affairs committee that Secre
tary Denby “initiated” transfer of
the California and Wyoming naval oil
reserves to the Interior Department
because there was no machinery in
the Navy department to prevent de
pletion of the reserves.
The Military Affairs committee
adopted an amendment in executive
session under which Henry Ford’s
Muscle Shoals offer would be placed
under the provisions of the Federal
water power act.

ury McAdoo, former Attorney Gen
eral Gregory, former Secretary of the

ministration, had been employed, after

Adoo, the witness said it was $50,000
a year; that he had been paid $260,-
000 and thrt he was still on the Do

that big oil companies outside the
reserves were draining off the oil
from the navy reserves and “that
that was the basis for the policy he
had adopted.”

THE EDUCATIONAL BILL
The United States Bureau of Edu
cation, which is co-bperating with The
National Educational Association, The
General Federation of Women’s Club’s
and others, have at last aroused the
members of Congress to the alarming
problem confronting this country, with
nearly 5,000,000 men and women un
able to read and T£e econom
ical liability of this! army of illiterate
foreigners has become alarming, and
the solution of the problem is demand
ing the best and wisest thought of the
people of the nation. The direct
bearing that this Condition presents
from abf economical stand, if for no
others, is sufficient to call a halt to the
army of foreigners being dumped on
our shores to become a liability, and
burden to our citizens, and must main
tain them when once they have been
admitted.
The readers of the Call of the
North, and other Ijtlan publications
will recall, thst the older —Sterling
Bill remained without being reported
out of the committee for more than
two years, due to Idle influence of the
Roman Catholic church, but it is grati
fying that at last this bill, which pro
vides for an appropriation of SIOO,-
000,000 for educational purposes, to be
destributed under a of edu
cation, as member of the President’s
cabinet, has been favorably reported
and introduced in bcfth the House and

WHILE SENATE "ORATES" PRESIDENT ACTS
WATCH TOR “FRANKED” CAMPAIGN LITERATURE
- -K-
Bureau of Publication and Education.
Washington, D. C., Jan. 81. The
writer of this article believes that it
is the province of the Klan to get
the truth and the facts to the country
and let people draw their own con
clusions about matters political as
well as otherwise. With this idea in
view and purely for the purpose of
analysis it is intersting to analyze
what has taken place in the United
States Senate this week up to date.
The writer sat in the gallery of
the Senate less than one hour before
writing this story and witnessed the
Senate vote unanimously on the res
olution directing the President of the
United States to do what he had al
ready done two or three days before
in the way of appointing counsel and
taking steps to correct what trans
pired in the conveying of valuable
public domain to private interests for
their own profit, by the preceding ad
ministration.
The Senate has been debating the
questioff aIT Week and while all thi3
oratory has been going on, President
Coolidge acted and acted quickly.
The real facts are that he beat the
Senate to the matter by about two
or three days for he acted at once
when the exposure was made of what
took place under the administration
of former Secretary Fall.
Upon the facts beinb learned, prac
tically all are agreed that a terrible
mistake was made. That was evi
denced today when the Senate voted
unanimously telling the President
what to do. Republicans, Democrats,
Farmer-Laborites, insurgents and
regulars all were of one mind and
they voted as a solid unit. But
doesn’t it look ridiculous for the Sen
ate to talk about this matter for
nearly a week when practically every
one knew just what to do days and
days ago. While the Senate talked,
President Coolidge acted, that’s the
difference.
Why the Speeches?
Why then all the speeches, all this
debate, all this oratory when every
one was thinking along the same
lines? Nothing to it in the world
but politics, that’s all one can make
out of it. Each side was trying to
gain an advantage for party inter
ests purely and solely. You can’t
make anything else out of it.
But don’t overlook the fact that all
these speeches in the Senate were
not made for nothing. They were
made for home consumption and cam
pagn distribution which will come
later. This is what the “deer peepul”
back home are prone to dub as pure
ly political bunk, that’s all there is
to it. When one sits down and
analyzes this thing quietly he can
reach no other conclusion. The Sen
ate talked and the President acted,
but the President got there first.
Punish the Guilty
Everyone believes there is guilt in
this famous case and it is practically
unanimous, too, that the guilty
should be punished. Sure, that’s
what we all want, but say the United
States Senate can talk about this
case all winter and can render no
punishment. The case will now go
into the court* and very likely to
the highest court in the land. There’s
where the verdict is to come from,
the court of last resort will fix the
punishment and t hat is where we are
headed for .in this case. Neither the
Senate nor the President can fix the
punishment, that is lfcft to the judi
ciary; that’s why our forefathers in
their great wisdom saw fit to divide
this government into the three divi
sions, viz., the legislative, the execu
tive and the judicial. The legislative
has done all the talking in this case,
the executive has taken the neces
sary steps to get it into the courts,
hence it is now up to the judicial di
vision to complete the business and

After Denby’s Scalp
The Democrats in the Senate have
now started after the scalp of Sec
retary of the Navy Denby. We don’t
want to prejudge this phase of the
case but Washington gossip has it
that this, too, is political play for
advantage. Mr. Denby may be
guilty; he says he is not and claims
the law engcted by Congress gave
him the authority to do what he did
do. In this opinion he evidently was
sustained by the late President Hard
ing and likewise by Secretary Fall.
The country now believes an awful
mistake was made; but the question
is, if this mistake was made, was it
not made according to the authority
granted by an act of Congress? The
country will learn later on whether
Secretary Denby is right or wrong.
If he is wrong he probably will get
out without being kicked out; but
suppose the court sustains him in
his contention? Then what? Where
will the Senate Democrats find them
selves if such proves to be the case?
Here’s the answer. Before any de
cision either way can be reached in
the courts the campaign of 1924 will
probably be over, hence if this is to
be made a campaign issue, if this is
more politics, now is the time to in
ject it. Hence, the resolution has
been introduced in the Senate and is
now under debate asking the Presi
dent to request Secretary Denby to
resign. It may carry, there is no
telling, but what if it does and the
President pays no attention to it ?
About all the Senate can do is to ask
for the resignation of Mr. Denby.
The latter has been a navy man all
his life; he ought to know what he
is doing; perhaps he doesn’t, but any
way this looks more politics for you
know a political campaign is ap
proaching and there must be issues
and munitions.
Another Resolution Pending
It’s a poor week when someone
doesn’t threaten to demand the res
ignation of Attorney General Daugh
erty; he is always in the limelight in
this respect but somehow he man
ages to hang on. He is the sort of a
fellow who doesn’t run under fire and
he has proven in the past to be some
scrapper and usually a winner. He
may lose this time, we don’t under
take to say; but he won’t quit just
because some senator has introduced
a resolution asking the President to
request him to quit his post. Such a
resolution has been introduced and is
scheduled to come up later but that
debate can't come on until Mr. Den
by’s resolution is disposed of.
It may be that some senator will
yet file a resolution asking President
Coolidge to step down and out and
give Secretary of State Hughes a
chance to make good in the White
House as he would be next in line for
such an emergency. But Mr. Cool
idge is more likely to go before the
people of this country next Novem
ber and give the people, the entire
people, an opportunity to say whether
they want him to continue in the
Presidential chair or get out. And
that will be some more politics.
In fact 1924 is a political year and
things have started in early in Wash
ington. It looks like it’s going to be
a humdinger, so far as politics go
from now until next November.

A CORRECTION
Recently we reprinted an article
that appeared in a number of our ex
changes reporting a raid on a Catho

the discovery of rifles in the church.
A correspondent sends us a letter
pointing out that no raid was ever
made on a Catholic church either in or
near Scottsdale and that no rifles
have ever been located in a Catholic
church of Scottsdale or vicinity. Our
readers may accept the correction as
true until wc publish statements to
the contrary.
