In a recent interview with Mr. L.
E. Thomas the New Orleans States
sasy: "There scem. oo doubt of the fact
that the present y r will prove the
most important in the history of bank
ing in Louisiana. The prosperity of the
State is now well along towards high
tide an dthe imprqved business condi
tions everywhere apparent will do much
towards making the a banner year for
the State banks. The number of banks
throughout the State is constantly in
creasing and the business of the oldest
established banks isigrowing in volume.
There is no doubt ,of the fact that very
soon New Orleans/ will become the
chief banking center of the entire
South."
