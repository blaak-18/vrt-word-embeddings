Tno. T. Keller, of New Orleans,
who is superintending the construc:
tion of the refinery, is a gentleman
of wide experience in this line.
His manner of supervising the work
shows that he is a workman of skill
and ability and that he knows exact
ly what to do and does it speedily
and well. The company was in
deed lucky in securing his services
as such a man was needed to con
clude the work in time for the conm
ing crop. Mr. Klein, of New Or
leans, fpreman of the bricklay
ing depa:tment, is also a competent
workm'an and is a "hustler". VWe
were pleased to see that a number
of Lafayette people were given em
ployment by the "contradtor.
Mr. Ralph Elliott has been assisting
in the construction of the refinery
in various ways.
The sale of "odds and ends" and
remnants, is going steadily on at
Moss Bros. & Co. The people wvho
know a good thing when they see it
are taking advantage of the special
ly low prices at which many goods
are being closed out before stock
taking.
",It is the best patent medicine in

the fact that dysentery in its
worst form was prevalant around
here last summer and it never took
over two or three doses of that rem
edy to affect a complete cure." For

'the acunsion of ce idva o
efinery at this plifto the planters,
and to the profits to -"be derived by 1
those who would invest -their money
irr that enterprise. But our people I
seem too timid to put their money c
in such an enterprise under the pre
sent condition of things. Our 1
friends of Lafayette seem bolder I
than we are, and we believe they 1
are right, the manufacturer who 1
buys the raw material accoiding to
market quotation has nothing to I
fear or to risk; it is the producer I
of the raw material-the planter
who runs all the risks of an over
crowded or depreciated market; the
manufacturer only pays the raw I
material at a price that will allow
him to makes his profit according to
market quotations without regard
to the raw meterial producer, if he
loses or make money never trouble t
the manufacturer who buys the raw
product. Then why are our people
afraid to do like our neighbors of 1
Lafayette, put themselves together '
and build a refinery that would do
so much good to this entire com
munity and pay handsome interests
to the investors.-St. Martin Mes- '

Dance at Duson.
On last Wednesday - night, the
young folks of Duson and vicinity
gave a dance at the large rice ware
house of Mr. Jos. Broussard. Dr.
R. M. Walker, ably assisted by Mr.
John Servat made all the necessary
arrangements for the dance, and to r
these two gentlemen more than to
anyone else is credit due for this t
great social success. .The floor was
nicely waxed for the dances, the
room was well seated and lighted,
and the music was very good. 2
There were at least two hundred t
present, who participated in the
evening's enjoyment until the wee
sma' hours of the night. The young
folks of Duson will doubtless follow
up this succ:ess with another dance }
shortly. It is to be hoped so.- r

Mouton-Barry.
Special to The Times Democrat.
Grand Cateau, July 3o.-Mr.
Fred Mouton, of Lafayette, La., f
and Miss Marie Barry, of this place,
were united in matrimony at the
Sacred Heart Church this morning
at 9 o'clock, Rev. Father C. M.
Widman offi ciating. Many rela
tives, friends and acquaintances
were in attendance. The groom is
a grandson of the late ex-Gov.
Alexander Mtouton, and is a suc
ccssful contractor and builder. Te
bride is a daughter of the late Syl
vester Barry, who was a promlinlet
merchant of this place for many
years. The hap,)y couple left on t
the i2:i6 train for their home in
Lafayette.
Mr. and ;Mrs. Mouton arrived in
Lafayette on the afternoon train on i
the day of the marriage and they I
have taken possession of their home i
in the addition. i
Mr. C. G. Strong, principal of the
public schools at Anderson, Cal.,
says: "I have used Chamberlain's
Pain BaJm and have found it an ex
cellent remedy for lameness and
slight wounds."
Lameness usually results from a
sprain, or other injury, or from
rheumatism, for which Chamber
lain's Pain Balm is especially intend
ed and unequalled. It affords al
most immediate relief and in a short
time effects a permanent cure.

Had Chandler Been There.m
A young negro, hailing from Gal
veston, got his foot between two
cars at Scott last Mon'.ay and suis
tained rather painful injuries. IHe I
was brought to this town and the
railroad officials at headquarters
were informed of the accident, but
at first refused to furnish the negro i
with transpbrtation to a point where 1
he could get relief, but when it was '
ascertained that no help would be
given by the parish and town au
thorities the company had him sent 1
to New Orleans. It msy be well to
state that some white men to whose
attention the condition of the negro
was called, collected a small sum of
money and purchased some medi
cine which Dr. Martin kindly con
sented to administer to the injured
negro who was considerably re-I
lieved. It is a pity that the editor
of the Inter-Ocean or Bill Chandler'
was not at the depot to see South
ern men dispense charity to a negro
and a Southern doctor give his ser
vices free of charge to relieve a
friendless and penniless darky.
Probably these vaunted friends of
Sambo would not have done as
much for him as those whom they
sometimes choose to call "Southern
brutes."

giog his arm wai broken in a wwese
near New Orleans and later he '1as
in another accideat when hlis train
passed through an open switch, the
engine toppling over and killing the
fireman, James Donally, but though
badly scalded Devoe escaped with
his life. ' He had barely gotten en
ttrely over the injuries received in
these accidents when he is reported
as being in a third one. Last Sat
urday night when I)evoe's train
stopped at Algiers he applied the
air brakes, which at that time were
in perfect working order. Then
the signal was. given the engineer to
pull the train to the incline, that iti
may be taken across the river on
the transfer boat Endeavor. As the
incline was approached Devoe again
applied the air brakes, but tl~;
time they did not work, and noth
ing whould strap the iron ho:se as it
rolled on toward the river. Fire
man Ryan saw what would be the
consequences if he ramained in the
cab of the engine, and jumped into
the river to save his life. Fortu
nately he did so without injury, and
when in the water he swam to shore
and was safe from harm. Devoe,
however, stuck to his post and went
with the engine until it stopped.
His left arm was broken, and ex
cepting several bruises, was not
otherwise injured.
Bazile Sonnier.
The remains of MIr. Bazile Son
nier, who died on July 25, were con
signed to their last resting place in
the Carenero cemetery on the 26th
inst.
An immense concourse of friends
assembled at the family residence
at the appointed hour, and thence
the remains were removed to St.
Peters Church, where the very im
posing ceremonies of the Catholic
church were performed by Rev.
Father Laforest. Mr. Sonnier died
at the age of 65 years, after an ill
ness that lasted only two days. He
leaves a widow, five sons and seven
daughters, among whom may -be
mentioned Messrs. Honore, Theo
phile, John, Joseph, and Bazile
Sonnier, Mesdames Clebert Mouton,
Celina Prejean, Theo. Hebett,
Adam Arcenaux, Elzena Arceneaux
and Misses Bornidet and .ophie

Mr. Sonnier was a Confederate

t! - imp :rtant events of !he war.
I  ,a i -iays been a staunch and
co,'n)-cintious Democrat. His circle
ot ac:;ut-i..tances and friends ex
tended to all the Southern parishes,
and included the most prominent
people of the section. He was
admired for his many sterling qual
ities, and respected by all who
knew him. He was a devoted hus
band, a loving, father and true and
faithful friend. D.
Prohibition for Lafayette.
PINIuooK, LA., July 31, 1895.
MR. EDITOR-I heard that at its
last session the Police Jury adopted
a resolution which says that should
one-fifth of the voters of this parish
sign a petition asking for an elec
tion on prohibition, that said peti
tion would be entertained.
Doesn't it strike your editorial
mind, Mr. Editor, that some peo
ple are getting just a trifle too good
in this parish? D)ocsn't it look a
if a handful ofsupervirtuous folks
are just a little previous? For heav
en's sake what might be the mat
ter with them that they want to
make of old Lafayette such a
goody-goody place that we'll have
but one step to make to reach the
"*beautiful shore." \We don't know
for a fact, but it seems to us that
we axe not quite ready for prohibi
tion. If our friends with watery
inclinations will turn their attention
toward other things, they may ac
complish some good, but in all
frankness, they are simply wasting
their angelic sweetness on the des
ert air when they come forward with
the proposition to rnmake this a dry
parish. Prohibition in this parish
would stand as much show as Gro
ver Cleveland in a Populist conven
tions, or Bob Ingersoll at a Baptist
canmp meeting.
There is not the least necessity
for prohibition in Lafayette. For
instance in the town of Lafayette
there is perhaps less liquor drunk
than in any other town in L.ouis
iana. We have had too many elec
tions in the past few years and the
voters should not be annoyed un
necessarily.
If they want to make people tem
perate let them do so by m >ul pur
suasion, but not by prohibitory
laws, which are not adapted to the
soil of this parish. They will never
grow here. They can not take
root. Our people are too liberal
minded to saddle such a ridiculous
law upon themselves.

"iThe lFranlklin Banner of the 25th

it is regretted that St. Mary will
soon lose the services of a District
Attorney so able, earnest and effi

After the spring election of 1895,
St. Mary will form a judicial dis
trict, and AMr. Gordy will be in an
other district. We have not heard
him express his intentions, but we
would hardly suppose he would care
to retain the place of district attor
ney longer than the present term.
I-is thorough knowledge of the
rules of law and evidence in crimi
nal practice, will secure him his full
share of business in that fielI, and
we believe will soon occupy a con
spicuous place in civil practice. He
has filled the office of district attor
ney with rare abilty.
