THE BULLOCK CASE
Release of the Accused From Jail-Her
Return Home.
'Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Josephine
Loggins Bullock was liberated from the
parish jail, where, on Saturday night,
she was incarcerated on the charge of
murder. The very thought of a reputable
woman, the mother of seceral children,
in jail was revolting to the sensibilities.
but while in custody Mrs. Bullock occu
pied a large and airy room with every
convenience which could be afforded,
and excepting the fact that she was in
jail, she was provided with every com
fort, being in many respects as good and
better than that enjoyed by many families
in this community. There is no maudlin
sentiment in this statement, but the cold,
cold facts, nothing more.
The crime for which Mrs. Bullock was t
arrested and held in custody is one which t
removes, in a great measure, if not al
together, the sympathetic feeling which
naturally is given to the woman in dis
tress. but when it is realized, from her t
own statements now contradicted by her- t
self, that she designed the death of her t
husband several months ago (and ac
cording to her own admission which she
has recalled) she had prepared capsules c
of pulverized glass for him, which she c
threw away, and latterly gave him croton
oil, there is in and about this case a re
volting sentiment which can not be re
pressed. A view of the case is suggested
on a consideration of published sensa- c
tional outburst of misapplied sentiment
not justified by the corcumstances, at
least, as indicate by the narrations of t
the facts, in the first instance, as detailed a
by Mrs. Bullock. Her alleged mistreat- r
ment and abuse by her husband will not a
be questioned, and if when abused or
mistreated she had killed him dead, there t
would have been in her favor, as a justi
fication, the natural resistance through I
which men are frequently acquitted of
murder on the plea of apparent self- r
defense; but the very thought of her t
deiiberate purpose of poisoning is shock- r
ing. In a general sense it will be conced- i
ed that there are men who deserve killing ,
Q genaeal .princiiples because they may
be exacting, selfigh, shiftless or a burden s
to their-families, but there are also men
who must contend with the peculiarities t
of supposedly "thesharer of his joys,"
etc., who leads him a dance, who fills
him with confusion and certainly demor
alizes him to the limit of the doubt of t;
life being worth the living. Sympathy, 1
is a rule, is always with the woman, be- (
cause in the majority of instances the
woman is right, but all men should not
be condemned because they are not fem
inine. In the case in hand we have heard
several versions by people who have
known the couple, and while it is ad
mitted he was irritable at times, and at
times when ill-tempered did use profane
words -in the hearing of his children, that
he was industrious and contributed his
part towards the maintenance of his
family. The couple had been married
nearly a quarter of a century and had
reared an interesting family of girls and
boys; and to think that after all these
years such an end was the lot of the hus
band is another forceful demonstration
that truth is stranger than fiction, and
the only charitable conclusion is that
Mrs. Bullock was or is of irrational
mind. One great link which has drawn
to her the sympathy of those who com
miserate with the unfortunate aid -the
distressed is her children, whose ap
pearance and manner- indicate that they
have received the care and attention of
their mother. And then she is a woman,
a woman who like pthers has had her
struggles, her privations, her cares and
her anxieties, the cares and the anxieties
which rack the nervous system and may
provoke distemper. A commission of
physicians have been appointid to exam
ine the mental condition of this unfor
tunate -woman, and it is probable that it
will be declared that she' was not re
sponsible. At any rate the case has
aroused public interest, not so much be
cause the husband is dead as it is the
manner of his demise. And, taking a
philosophical view of the case, the re
lease-of Mrs. Bullock," while based on
the fact that she could not be convicted
on her own statements, has returned to
her children their another who in their
home, no ajkter how humble it may be,
Sis to themtheir mother, and while at her
home she is still liable to such action as
make reached by the grand jury.

OUTLET SYSTEM
The Only Hope for the Mississippi-The
Views oi Engineer G. H. Shaw.
New Orleans States: "I believe that
the solution of the river problem will
not be in building higher levees but in
excavating outlets," said Mr. G.'H. T.
Shaw at the St. Charles yesterday, the
eminent civil engineer who has for the
past year been so active in redeeming
Southern swamp lands and in irrigating
the rice fields of the further southwest
ern portion of the State. "I have been
watching the levee system for a number
of years, having been engaged in the re
deeming of swamp lands all up and
down the Mississippi, a work that would
naturally bring me in close contact with
many problems connected with levee
building.
"After every big floood and high water
the levees are invariably raised from one
to three feet, and yet a few years later
the water goes still higher than at any
past time in the river's history.
"Now, there seems to be but one way
to account for this condition, and that is
that the bottom of the river fills up as
the levees along its bank are raised.
"I venture in the way of prophecy that
some day there will be a canal with locks
cut through Lake Maurepas above the
city into Lake Pontchartrain wide and
deep enough so that during floods it can
be opened and the floods in the rivei re
duced.
"Such a canal would not raise the level
of the lake nearly so much as a strong
wind from the gulf often, does.
"I am convinced in my own mind that
this present high water which will break
all past records, will set a mighty cur
rent of interest to work towards securing
an outlet system. I know that eminent
engineers have combatted the outlet sys
tem in the past and many will doubtless
do so in the future. but at least another
high water in the river, surpassing the
present record-breaker, will convince the
most skeptical oi those who because of
their interest in present systems find it
most convenient fo stick to the levee
theory and cause them to fall into line
with the outlet theorists.
"The time is 'coming when the MissiP
sippi will be provided with outlets and
then there will 'be no more 'records' es
tablished by high water periods."
ROBERT TROTTER DEAD.
In a note to the Caucasian is conveyed
the ir formation of the death of Robert
Trotter, which occurred at his home in
Caddo parish, below Shreveport, on
Wednesday, March ti, at 8:3o o'clock.
from heart disease, from which he had
suffered more or less for several years.
He moved from Canada in x869 and
located in Louisiana in I87o. In 1887 he
was married to Mrs. Mary E. Adley and
was a devoted husband, kind and con
siderate father, a kind neighbor and
friend, and was prompt and faithful in
the discharge of his duty. He was held
in the highest esteem by his friends and
acquaintances and was endeared to his
loved ones by all the ties which are the
dearest of earth.
RIVER FORECAST.
Reported by the United States Weath
er Bureau service:
Red river will probably continuie to
fall at Fulton until another heavy rain
fall occurs over the upper valley.
Some above 33 feet is expected at
Shreveport by Saturday, with rise con
tinuing into next week. Much still de
pends upon weather to determine highest
stage.
Pbints above Shreveport, in Louisiana,
will probably not experience quite as
high water as in last December, though
the difference will be slight, as when last
heard from the river was reported to be
rising steadily; communication with
several places now interrupted.
Below Shrevepdrt high flood stages are
to be anticipated by next week if all
levees hold.
IN SELF-DEFENSE.
S. S. McCarver, the saloon man who
shot and killed Bird Tracey in the Re
ginia saloon on Texas avenue, corner of
Lawrence, on June ig, 1902, was ac
quitted Tuesday afternoon by the jury
which tried the case. The plea of self
defense was sustained. It was in evi
dence that Tracey was not armed, but
when shot he was attempting to crawl
over the bar for the purpose of disarm
ing McCarver and killing him as he had
threatened. It is said that Tracey was a
"bad man" from "Bitter Creek" It was
also in evidence that the night or even
ing preceding the homicide that Tracey
had ran out McCarver from his ows
saloon with1 a pistol and threatened te
kill him. Bird Tracey is also associates
with Tracey, the man man of Oregon
who s.iied gto escape arrest.
