Mansfield Democrat-Journal.
The Gazette came to the above
conclusion someseverely time ago. As
long as the people don't take up this
question of good roads there wisal be
nothing done. No amount of
newspaper talk will accomplish any
thing. It's all right if an editor
aboatutes n of Kentucky provides
Sroads, -but h must not believe that
his opinion on the matter day, shall be
inmore weightless than oa feather in amore

Leithe the Space norI
the in nation to reply tofall the ,[l
long-vwindcd and belabored -iirticle, di
signed "''Tompkins;" an anonymous
writer in The Creole-American. In ws
our last issue we asked "Tompkins" H
to show wherein the Police Jurors Q
of this parish had been "jumping ro
jacks." We said nothing of a per- cr
sonal nature against anyone, but ag
simply challenged "Tompkins" to ilk
prove what he had said. This he la
has not done, but instead of doing th
what he should have done, he makes ,,
additional charges that are abso- I
lutely false. He charges The Ga- we
zette with being "the self-admitted hl
organ of the Police Jury in Lafa- fa
yette," and also of being "the ,
special orgab' of that body, and m
he goes on- F
"And "Tompkins" cannot en
tirely relieve his mind from the im- Io
pression that the "hand" that is
suspected of fawning with the dang
ling piece of twine, is the same one
that has bravely dashed forward to a
defend its own." a
As the meaning of the above is s1
rather obscure and somewhat vague, ti
perhaps "Tompkins" is (as in his a
charges against the Police Jury) n
trying to make us mad. In that tl
case he deserves to be treated with I
L contempt; but if he means that The p
Gazette is run by the Police Jury or h
f any other set of men, or by any in- r
) dividual, other than its editor, he is 1
i guilty of a deliberate and infamous I
f lie. t
This paper has never been, s
- it is not, and will never be t
- the organ or mouth-piece of any r
I body of men or of any indi- v
1 vidual, as long as it is under the A
a management of the present editor. i
- We write our own editorials and do
not go to "Tompkins" or to any- c
t body else to write them for us, and I
whatever appears in our columns s
- are the views and honest convic- c
s tions of the editor. t
The immaculate "Tompkins i
3 says irt his last grievance: "' 'Tomp- I
a kins" wants it clearly understood <
- that, by nature, it is impossible for
e him to lower himself to that plane i
in life where reason and principle
e become subservient to hatred and
prejudice, and does not intend that
3 any strictures he may inflict on any
e servant of the public, as such, shall
be corttrued into anything of a
J personal nature."
If "T'ompkins" wishes the pcople
n to know whether he has a low or
d high nature let him show his hand.
- Let him sign his name and not at
,s tempt to injure this paper by making
baseless charges under cover of a
fictitious name. If he is the broad
minded, high-toned, chivalrous gen
tleman whose sole aim is the "public
good," why does he seek to shirk
r- the responsibility of his actions.
Let him give his name to the public
a and thereby unfold to the gaze of the
re multitude his manifold virtues, his
I. disinterested patriotism, his un
- blemished record, and sterling in
tegrity. The people should know
d tlis great friend of their's. Patriots
- are scarce these days, and if we
have one in our community, he
'e should be known. This man with
,s such a pure nature, this relentless
is foe to corruption and enemy to de
)e relict officials should uncover his
of head that Lafayette citizens may
y- know him.
or This ntw aro;tle f Parkhurstian
te ism should disclose his illustrious
te cognomen so that it may be handed
at down to posterity as the embodi
Ce ment of all that is pure and mag
a nanimous. B3ut, alas! it might tell
if another tale.
It is rich; it xis really refieshing
to hear some men who have been
repeatedly elected to office, and are
n- now holding office, abusing ballot
al box stuffers as the most unmiti
he gated lot of villains outsidz the
le walls of the penitentiary. Some of
ay these men who have been the sole
ot beneficiaries of these very wicked
es and corrupt men, are posing as
li- purists and are loudly clamoring
tr- for ballot-reform-a pure ballot
be and fair count. Notwithstanding
re this pretended change of heart we
r- have not yet heard of one of these
n- receivers of stolen goods tending
he his resignation and returning his ill
le- gotten gains to the State and people
n- from where they were, according to
er his logic, wrongfully taken. MXany
is of these same fellows are agitir can

One night when Mr. Isaac Reese der
was stopping with me, says M. F. it
Hatch, a prominent merchant of any
Quartermaster, Washington, I heard qui
him groaning. On going to his lar
room I found him suffering from estl
cramp colic. He was in such an 8ge
agony I feared he would die. I hast- roi
ily gave him a dose of Chamber- the
lain's Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea a'
Remedy. He was soon relieved and the
the first words he uttered were, mu
"what was that stuff you gave me?" and
I informed him. A few days ago
we were talking about his attack and
he said he was never without that tig
remedy now. I have used it in my
family for several years. I know its of
worth and do not hesitate to recom- II
mend it to my friends and customers. wi:

BIG PROFITS Small Investments.
Returning prosperity will make many rich, but nowhere can they make so much within a short time
as by successful Speculation in Grain, Provisions and Stock.
$ 10 00 FOR EACH DOLLAR INVESTED can be made by our
Systematic Plan of Speculation
originated by us. All successful speculators operate on a regular system.
It is a well-known fact that there are thousands of men in all parts of the United States who. by
systematic trading through Chicago brokers, make large amounts every year ranging from a few thou
sand dollars for the man who invests a hundred or two hundred dollars up to 155o,00oo to Szooooo or more
by those who invest a few thousand.
It is also a fact that those who make the largest profits from comparatively small investments on this
plan are persons who live away from Chicago and invest through brokers who thoroughly understand
systematic trading.
Our plan does not risk the whole amount invested on any trade, but covers both sides, so that
whether the market rises or falls it brings a steady profit that piles up enormously in a short time.
WRITE FOR CONVINCING PROOrs. also our lManual on successful speculation and our Daily
Market Report, full of money-making pointers. ALL FRRB. Our lalanual explains margin trading
fully. Highest references in regard to our standing and success.
