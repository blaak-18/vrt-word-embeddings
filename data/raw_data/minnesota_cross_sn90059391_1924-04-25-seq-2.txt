(Bureau of Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, I). C., April 15.—Representative Robsion, of
Kentucky, gave the Italian congressman, l.a Guardia, of New York,
a most beautiful won! trimming the other day on the floor of the
house when the immigration bill was under consideration, in reply
to slanderous statements made about ’he people of Kentucky by
La Guardia. The man from New York made insulting, slandering
and vicious statements about Kentucky people, especially those
from the mountain counties, and here is the way Congressman Rob
sion made La Guardia look like .‘lO cents:
Kentucky Blood Riled
“Mi Chairman, it is my purpose in
rising to correct the Record, but
more especially to correct the gen
tleman from New York (Mr. La Guar
dis). I can not understand how any
representative of the great Empire
state would go out of his way to ut
ter the vicious, contemptible slander
against the mountain people of Ken
tacky and the state of Kentucky on
the floor of the house, when 1 was
necessarily absent on official duties.
The gentleman from New York stated
directly and by insinuation that we
no schools in the highlands of
Kentucky, the people were on star
vation, aliens could not learn or see
any examples of law and order, and
they would not have opportunity to
learn much of our American institu
tions or Americanism.
“In the great 11th congressional
district of Kentucky there are nine
splendid colleges and institutes,
niere are about 25 A-l high schooLs.
flvery community has its public
octtool. Many of the young men and
women out of these schools take
their places at the heads of the lead
lot; institutions of learning of the
notion. In a single year five young
men and women of my home county
took the highest honors at five of
America’s leading universities.
TMy so-called mountain district has
railroads running in every direction,
with three great railroad shops. Our
snilroad men receive the wages paid
to other railroad men of the coun
try. There are produced In my dis

By Contrast
“Our workingmen will measure up
and compare most favorably in in
telligence, high moral character and
lofty patriotism to the workingmen
or any other class of men in any oth
er part of the nation. We have n
sweatshops. We don’t have squalor
such as is found in the great city of
New York. Nearly all of our work
ing people are 100 per cent Ameri
cans, and they stand as a unit for
this, the Johnson bill. They know
that unless the hordes of immigrants
are checked and America ceases to
he the ‘garbage can and dumping
ground for the world’ their wages will
be reduced and living standards great
ly lowered.
“It is outrageous slander for the
gentleman from New’ York to say
that an alien could not learn law and
order or see examples of law and or
der in the highlands of Kentucky.
While Kentucky and the mountains
of Kentucky are strengthening the
eighteenth amendment and other
laws, we find the great state of New
York repealing its law-enforcement
code. Tne people in my home town
more than 40 years ago voted out
liquor and the soloons. It was voted
out of every county in my district
more than 20 years ago. There is
about as much difference in my dis
trict and the genteman’s district in
New York City as there is between
the Sahara desert and the Atlantic
oce^n.
“We do not "have any 'black hand’
organizations. We have no tong wars.
We have no buildings blown up with
dynamite. We have no bank robber
ies or cashiers or messengers mur
dered. either in tKo daytime or the
nighttime. I woulu make no refer
ence to these things but for the un
fair and baseless charge made by the
gentleman from New York against a
law-abiding. God-fearing, liberty-lov
ing patriotic people. It is a joke for
the gentleman from New York city
to speak disparagingly as to any part
of our country.
Distinguished Men
‘Two of the three last governors
of the state of Kentucky, one a Dem
ocrat, the other a Republican, came
from my mountain district. The
K resent chief justice of Kentucky’s
ighest court is from my district.
This same district furnished a mem
ber of the supreme court of the Unit
ed States, a cabinet officer, a gover
nor for Missouri, a governor for Mon
tana, a senator for Illinois, and oth
ers.
“We take great pride in our moun
tain people and our highlanders.
When Jehovah wished to bring a
great message to the world He se
lected a mountain. Has .the gentle
man forgotten Mount Horeb, Mount
Sinai, the Sermon on the Mount, the
Mount of Transfiguration or the Man
who came from the hills of Galilee?
Has not the gentleman read the story
of Switzerland and the Scotch high
landers? God’s great revelation to
man was declared from mountain
tops. Political and religious free
dom found their first expression in
the highlands.
Has not the gentleman read how
our ancestors migrated from Virginia
to Kentucky? How the sharpshoot
ers from the mountains of Kentucky
marched with that grand old hero,
General Jackson, to New Orleans and
gave the British such a ‘spanking’
that they have never again attempt
eiNto put the yoke upon us? Has not
the gentleman read the story of Lin
coln, Zachary Taylor, Jefferson Da
vis and others from the foothills of
Kentucky when they carried the stars
and stripes to victory at Buena Vis
ta. Monterey and to the citadel of
Montezuma?
“Does not the gentleman know that
in many of these mountain counties
more men entered the Union army
in defense of this republic than there
were voters in the country? Does n«t
the gentleman know that one of these
mountain counties in my district
oversubscribed its Liberty Loan quo
ta more times than any other county
in the nation, and another county led
in its subscription to the Red Cross,
and another county furnished more
officers to its quota of soldiers than
any other county in the nation, and
two mountain boys won the congres
sional medal of honor and the cita
tions of the other allied governments
for extraordinary bravery on the
Flanders field?
Here’s something else for Mr. La
Guardia to put in his bonnet. One of
our mountain counties in my dis
trict filled its quota so quickly that
it was not necessary to draft a sin
gle man for the world war; more peo
ple volunteered than there was a quo
ta, and not a man, woman, or child
was convicted for disloyalty during
the war.
“Where were the gentleman’s an
cestors when Andrew Jackson and the
Kentucky mountaineers were uphold
ing the flag? The people of the
mountains of Kentucky refuse to be
lectured in patriotism and American
ism by the gentleman from New York.
I am resenting his attack.
“The gentleman says an alien could
not learn Americanism in the moun
tains of Kentucky. There is noth
ing but Americanism in the moun
tains. In the great city of New York
groups of foreigners were in recent
years marched under the red flag of
anarchy. There is no room in the
mountains of Kentucky for the red
flag. We know there is but one coun
try, one loyalty and one flag.”
Be Patient With the Boys
I have a profound respect for boys.
Grimy, ragged, tousled boys In the
street often attract me strangely.
A boy is a man in a cocoon, —you do
not know what it is going to become,
his life is big with possibilities.
He may make or unmake kings,
change boundary lines between
states, write books that will hold
character, or invent machines that
will revolutionize the commerce of
the world. Every man was a boy—
it seems strange, but it is really 90.
Wouldn’t you like to turn time back
ward, and see Abraham Lincoln at
twelve, when he had never worn a
pair of boots, —the lank, lean, hun
gry boy, hungry for love, hungry for
learning, tramping off through the
woods for twenty miles to borrow a
book, and spelling it out crouching
before the glare of the burning log's?
Distinctly and vividly I remember
a squat, freckled boy who was born
in tne “Patch” and used to pick up
coal along railroad tracks in Buffalo.
A few months ago I had a notion to
make before the court of appeals at
Rochester. That boy from the
“Patch” was the judge who wrote
the opinion granting my petition.
Yesterday I rode horseback past a
field where a boy was plowing. The
lad’s hair stuck out through the top
of his hat, one suspender held his
trousers in place, his form was bony
and awkward, his bare legs and arms
were brown and scratched and brier
scarred. He turned his horses just
as I passed by, and from under the
flapping brim of his hat he cast a
quick glance out of dark, half-bash
ful eyes, and modestly returned my
salute. When his back was turned.
I took off my hat and sent a God
bless-you down the furrow after
him.
Who knows, I may yet go to that
boy to borrow money, or to hear him
preach, or beg him to defend me
in a lawsuit; or he may stand with
pulse unmoved, bare of arm, in white
apron, ready to do his duty, while
the cone is placed over my face, and
night and death come creeping into
my veins.
Be patient with the boys!—Elbert
Hubbard, in the Philistine.
THE FIERY CROSS
Rolling Merrily Along
Wig Wags\fvom Washington
(Itureati of Publ lent lon mid Kdueatlon)
WASHINGTON. D. C.. April 16
Some one tried to work the Missouri
Democrats and influence them against
the Klan, and they wouldn’t work.
They rejected resolutions favoring
the modification of the Volstead act
and condemning the Ku Klux Klan.
This all happened in the Democratic
state convention of Missouri at
Springfield. This sounds like R. B.
Creager, of Texas, or some of his
henchmen. At any rate, the Klan is
on top in Missouri, where it is going
to remain.
The Difference
A student and reader who likes to
spend considerable time here in the
congressional library, said to be the
most beautiful and complete library
in this country, if not in the world,
is authority for the statement that
he has been looking up books on
Protestantism from its foundation up
to the present time, and here is his
comment: *
“You can carry all the books in
your arms that are in the congres
sional library on Protestantism, while
there are rows and rows, possibly
several tons of books on the shelves
on Catholicism.”
“The White Sister”
The local management of a 'cer
tain theater in a middle west city
called at the office of a Klan publi
cation and asked the editor to come
and review the motion picture, “The
White Sister,” saying that if it was
approved he would run it and if it
was not approved he would not use
same.
A committee from the Klan paper
reviewed it and were unanimous in
the opinion that it is the most insid
ious piece of Roman Catholic propa
ganda they had ever witnessed. Tnis
decision was given to the manage
ment and the picture was not run.
That sort of co-operation is re
freshing indeed.
Foreign Language Press
The foreign language press is get
ting so strong in this country that
it is holding conferences and conven
tions. One was held in Los Angeles
recently. Here is a significant state
ment from The Fourth Estate: “At
least 75 per cent of the foreign born
do not read English and it is neces
sary that the educational work—tel
ing the story of this country, its op
portunities, etc., should be carried on
in the respective languages of the
immigrant groups. It strives towards
a united America, by telling the im
migrant in his own language what
this great country offers him and
what it expects of him.
“In the city of Los Angeles alone
there are at least 100,000 immigrants
who read no other language than
their own, and another 10,000 who
depend largely for the news of the
day upon the newspaper printed in
their own mother tongue.”
Klan Leader’s Home Target
A story comes from Marion, Illi
nois, to the effect that 14 shots were
fired by unidentified persons into the
home of Sam Stearns, chairman of
the county board of supervisors and
reputed leader of the Williamson
county Ku Klux Klan. Ross Lizenby,
a farm employee, was shot through
the leg. Tne shots narrowly missed
Mrs. Stearns.
In a bitter election fight at Herrin
in which the Klan ticket was victori
ous, City Judge E. N. Bowen, Joe
Caravalia, president of the board of
health, and Dominic Lani, all alleged
anti-Klansmen. were arreeted on a
charge of making false affidavits.
The arrests were made by Chief of
Police John Ford and Policeman Har
old Crain, both Herrin Klanamen,
and S. Glenn Young, paid Klan dry
raider.
• Inspector Called Off
Postoffice Inspector Donaldson, who
was pulled off making the investiga
tion of the alleged land frauds in the
Rio Grande valley in Texas, told the
senate committee the other dsv that
he began his investigation in March,
1921, and workad that summer on the
job. Then he was suddenly celled off
and relieved by Postoffice Inspector
Williamson.
Mr. Donaldson told the committee
that he did not think the investiga
tion had been finished by either him
self of Williamson, as neither had
been to the valley to interview any
of the complainants. Donaldson is
the postoffice inspector who worked
up the case against the Stewart Land
Company, of Kansas City.
Another Klan Victory
“It is a victory for the Ku Klux
Klan,” Attorney Harry Sloan, of Mil
waukee, said on election night.
"There is no use holding out false
hope, no use kidding you. Rose is
defeated. The Klan won."
Mr. Sloan is a law partner or Rose,
the defeated candidate. Mayor Hoan
was re-elected, and the lawyer says
the Klan did it.
CURTIS D. WILBUR
Curtis D. Wilbur, formerly chief Jms
tice of the California Supreme court
who has been appointed secretary of
the navy.
Fiery Cross Burned;
Tower Given Thrill
TOWER, MINN., April 12.—The
burning of a cross of the kind asso
ciated in the public mind with the
Ku Klux Klan, on Swanson’s point
across Pike bay from here, was the
Principal topic of conversation here.
ocated only about half a mile from
the center of town, it was plainly vis
ible to those who happened to be out
or responded to the single tap of the
fir* belL
Swanson’s point is on a county
road, but is more or less inaccesible
now, and it is the general opinion
that some boy or practical joker of
more mature years placed and fired
the cross. If the K. K. K. had any
thing to do with it, it is generally be
lieved that they came from some dis
tance to set the fire.
Shut the Gates
And don’t forget that the Roman
hierarchy is dumping immigrant nuns
into this country as rapidv and as
conveniently as possible. According
to the recent ruling of Judge Wins
low, Pope Pius can nut every Catholic
priest and nun in the old country up
on American soil and without the
slightest interference from the gov
ernment. Never was the need more
imperative than now that Klansmen
do their duty toward their country
and their religion.
The automobile pays more in li
cense fees than is spent on good roads
in this country. The nation can af
ford more and better roads; it can af
ford more and better schools. Good
roads everywhere mean good schools
everywhere; both together mean good
citizens everywhere.
Just an surelv as we follow the pre
cepts of our Master, Klansmen, we
shall lead men, and in leading them
teach them.

mittee had clearly gone beyond its au
thority. The Republican leader charged
