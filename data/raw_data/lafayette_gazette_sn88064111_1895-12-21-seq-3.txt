SA Fatal Blow.
Last Thursday: at noon a very
seribusi and probably fatal -affray
occurred between Dan Keeshen, a
stranger here, and B. H. Wilkins,
the a German and well-known, milkman
the -of this place. Keeshen -was in
the charge of Mr. Vigneaux's branch
stable near the depot when Wilkins
entered and desired his horse stabled.
A boy took the animal in charge'
and Keeshen inquired what was
wanted, whereupon Wilkins began
a tirade of gross and abusive lan
guage toward Keeshen. The latter
in a fit of passion, struck Wilkins a
fearful blow on the back of the head
with a heavy broomstick, inflicting a
ay dangerous fracture of the skull and
felling his victim unconscious
at to the earth. Drs. Martin and Tol
son were called and did all in medi
cal skill to afford the unfortunate
in man relief, but expressed grave
doubts of recovery. Deputy Sher
:s, iff Thos. Mouton promptly arrest-I
ed Keeshen and lodged.him in jail. v
Keeshen stated that he is a native s
of New York, 53 years of age, un
married and has been South for the t
ts past ten years working in San An- s
tonio, Houston and other places. "
s, He came to Lafayette about the
. first of July last and has been em- c
ployed in the livery business. He I
re claims this his first serious trouble, tl
1' having never before been incarcer
ated.
11 At last accounts Mr. WVilkins was
r still unconscious and not expected
to live more that a few hours.
IMarshal Veazey Removed.
The City Council in special ses- tb
sion last Wednesday removed City of
y Marshal D. J. Veazey for gross mis
11 conduct. Deputy Marshal Alcee
Bourg was elected to fill the va- Bi
a cancy created by the dismissal of fe
t the chief police officer and will
qualify as marshal. The new mar
shal has the power to appoint a
- deputy, but it is understood will
not fill the office permanently until Sin
next month. Whether ex-Marshal
Veazey will abide the action of the F
Council in his removal from office i
before the expiration of his term soi
next May does not yet appear. A Ail
full Council determined the matter. Joe

How to Kil a Paper. ortl
Just let your subscription go. It
is only a dollar, and the publisher
don't need it. If he asks you for it To
just get as mad as you can and tell
him to stop the paper; that you '9
don't read it anyway. Then go and Nov
borrow your neighbor's. When the /:
advertising and job man comes tell
him you don't need to advertise, Ij
that everybody knows you, and that "iy
you will try to get along without
letter heads, bill heads, etc. It is No.
too expensive and business is slack, a u e. r
and you must economise. Never Jot
call on the editor unless you want a Ale
free notice or a lengthy obituary To
for a beloved friend. Never recom
mend the paper to anybody.

It We are in receipt of a letter from Messrs. C
D I)an Taluage's Sons, New York, in which te
Sthey state that while they thus far had good bt
success in the milling and sale of creole, or w,
red, rice, still, they do not wish to be under- p]
stood as reccmmnending its culture' in the tl
e future. "It may possess all the merits BI
claimed by the governmcnt chemist, yet, ec
t looking at things from a practical stand- ht
,r point, it is not wise to run counter to the lic
o prejudices of the consumer. lie wants Ci
d white rice and will pay for it, because it cl
pleases the eye, two, three or four times the Ci
price of red. For this reason the whiter
sorts are by all odds the better to cultivate."
Â° They also hand the following pertinent sug
gestions, which are worthy consideration as be
we are about entering upon preparations for ]
the new crop:
I. Care in selecting or cleaning land.
2. Care in planting good seed.
3. Care in cultivation.
