Truth In Herrin Case
Hi* troth about the condition* in
Williamson county, Illinois, In which
na enragwd people arose In the face
«f many odds to drive out Illicit ll

through to the public outside of Wil

feltf, pastor of the First M. E.
.church at Herrin, who was one of the
loaders In organizing the law-enforc*
Inr element Into a militant body, is
■doing his part to let the world know
sf the conditions before and after
dhe raids that startled the country.
The raids were sensational only In
the sense that the yellow newspapers
distorted the news, misrepresented
the conditions and took sides with
the law breakers. Iheee yellow Journ

Hie Post-Dispatch was one of the

flects on the Klan organisation. The
reader’s attention is called to the
|act that the word Klan is not men

Glotfelty to take credit from any

tie knows the clean-up would not
have been possible without the aid of
members of the Klan. Therefore, It
Is refreshing that the Post-Dispatch

of the St. Clair County Women’s
Christian Temperance Union, that
Glotfelty, one of the leaders in the
campaign of liquor raids that twice
resulted in the sending of soldiers
to the county, declared the purpose
to continue the campaign witnout
relying on the neutral citizens’ com
mittee appointed at the suggestion
of the military leaders. The audience
warmly applauded the utterance.
Describes Conditions
Glotfelty, introduced by Mrs. Mary
Dolley, of Lebanon, county president
of the W. C. T. U., began nis story
with his assignment to the Herrin
church two years ago. “Every saloon
that had been in business before pro
hibition was running,” he said, ,f and
restaurants were selling liquor, and
there were gambling houses and
houses of prostitution. There was a
strong foreign element with no re
spect for law or American institu
tions. Herrin kowtowed to these for
eigners. Ninety per cent of the sa
loons were run by them. The busi
ness element catered to them. Mer
chants voted for the wide-open town
and went on the bonds of the boot
leggers.
“Last year there was an election.
A wide-open man was opposed by a
Methodist for mayor. The wide-open
man won. After that we had every
thing in the way of vice and crime
that you have in St. Louis and East
St. Louis. Eagan’s rats came down.
Booze cars operated back and forth.
A hotel was operated as a house of
prostitution under the noses of the
mayor and police. Women were in
sulted on the streets in daylight.
The county roads were made danger
ous by drunken drivers. Hold-ups
were frequent.
Haw Galllgan Was Elected
“Then a county election came along
and the miners were told that if they
didn’t elect Galligan sheriff they
would be hung for the Herrin mas
sacre. They elected him. Conditions
became worse. The only criminals
molested were those who wouldn’t
divvy up. The state’s attorney
backed the sheriff. The circuit judge
was one of them. The decent people
were afraid to open their heads.
“Then I got our people together
and told them it was our business to
clean things up. We began with a
15-weeks’ revival. We put enough red
blood in our men to get them on the
job forever. A lot of them had been
afraid of their shadows before that.
Last August we asked every church
in the county to send men to Marion,
the county seat, to demand that the
officers clean up the county or take
the consequences. The officers
laughed at us. They would like to
see us help ourselves, they said.
Send Delegation to Washington
“We went to Springfield and spent
a week there. We had a conference
with Governor Small. He’s getting
smaller every day down our way.
‘You’ve got just what you elected,’ he
said, and laughed at us.
“Then we sent a delegation to
Washington. Federal Prohibition
Commissioner Haynes said he could
not send an army to clean up the out
landish condition in Williamson coun
ty. Our men said, ‘We’U furnish the
army if you will give us the author
ity.’ He told us to go back and get
ready and he would send the author
ity and deputize all our men.
“In Washington we picked up the
man they think so much of in the
newspapers and always tell the op
?osite of what he does. S. Glenn
oung came to Willlfcnnson county.
He is the most gentwl man I ever
met, as clean cut as a hound’s tooth.
He spent two months getting the
evidence. I guess he bought booze at
every joint in the county.
A Christmas Gift
“When everything was ready we
decided to give the crooks a Christ
mas treat. On Saturday, December
22, a thousand men assembled at Car
bondale and were deputized by fed
eral officials. The deputies scattered
in automobiles to their assignments.
Forty cars came into Herrin. Eight
o’clock was the zero hour. At the
stroke of eight the joints of Herrin
and Williamson county were simul
taneously raided. Five hundred men
and women were arrested. I wanted
to go along, but they wouldn’t let me.
They said they wanted me to be able
to preach next day.”
At this point a woman slipped down
a side aisle and handed Glotfelty a

and bombastic claims.
pink note. Glotfelty glanced at it
and laughed. “That thing,” he said,
“says there are reporters present. I
don’t care if they are. rm here to
tell the truth. If they do the same
nobody can object.”
Now Herrin Is Dry
Continuing he said: “For the first
time in history Herrin is dry. There
is not a roadhouse in Williamson
county.
“The military came, 2,000 strong.
The Chicago soldiers entered Herrin
with bayonets set. There were not
enough people on the street to say
hello to them. Everybody laughed at
them. We put some of them up at
our church. The rest were billeted
in empty saloons. The Chicago pa
pers said the Chicago soldiers had
the situation in hand. It was a joke,
but it made the southern Illinois sol
diers mad; the Chicago troops had to
be taken away before daylight to pre
vent a fight among the troops.
“The military men asked the cir
cuit judge to appoint a citizens’ com
mittee. He asked a couple of lawyers
to help him get together a neutral
bunch. Ha! That’s an impossible
word. There’s no such animal as a
neutral in Williamson county. On
one side are the red-blooded Ameri
can men who belong to churches and
have at heart the welfare of the peo
ple. On the other are the bootleg
gers and gamblers and their accom
plices. Every man in Williamson
county is on ohe side.br the other.
He has to be. ■*
“Well, they appointed his so-called
neutral committee. Every Herrin
man on it is a wet. They go on the
bonds of They are
afraid to open their heads. You can’t
tell us they are neutral. They con
cluded that the sheriff should be re
moved, but compromised by leaving
him in the office as a figurehead.”
“Birth Pang of a New Day”
‘The other day the major had a
bunch of us preachers on the carpet.
He told us to get our people lined up
and there would be no more trouble.
I told him we were lined up and on
tiptoe, ready to go ahead. ‘We’re the
fellows who cleaned up Williamson
county,’ I told him, ‘and we’re going
to keep it cleaned up.’ I told him we
were going to have a mass meeting
Sunday afternoon and asked him to
have the committeemen there and
have the sheriff deputize them and
we would think they meant business.
He notified the committemen and the
sheriff to be there but they didn’t
come.
“What we are going through down
there is the birth pang of an new day
in Illinois. We are going to stand
together as one man to finish the job.
We’ll finish the job if it takes the
last cent of our money and the last
drop of our blood."
Glotfeltv was applauded most when
he praised S. Glenn Young and dis
paraged Governor Small and when he
declared that the men of Williamson
county were going to finish the job.

representation from their own ranks
in the national congress.
“If I am elected to the United
States senate, my efforts at all times
shall be to seve fairly and fearlessly
the interests of the people and the
nation.”
A One-Time Populist
Years ago, when the Populist party
was in flower, Ola Sageng began his
political career .as a member of that
party, but deserted it and entered
the ranks of the Republicans. He
served one term in the state house
of representatives and occupied a
seat in the senate from 1906 to 1922.
when he voluntarily retired. Mr.
Sareng has always been known as a
progressive Republican and a fear
less champion of those things which
were of interest to the rank and
file.
With Ole and Manus against each
other, we look for a real senatorial
battle with the edge, according to
present indications, in favor of the
incumbent, Magnus Johnson of Kim
ball. It will be a political battle
wherein “dirt fanner’ will oppose
“dirt farmer.’’l can’t help but feel
that the present Minnesota political
situtaion which eliminates the law
yer from consideration, a« far as the
United senate is concerned, is quite
satisfactory.

the state legislature, he having filed
to fill the 56th district in the next
house if elected.
Candidates for state supreme court
are: Justice Royal A. Stone, St. Paul;
Justice Andrew Holt, Minneapolis;
Judge Hugo Hanft, St. Paul; candi
dates for chief justice of the state
supreme court are; Chief Justice
Samuel B. Wilson, Mankato; Judge
Hugo O. Hanft, St. Paul; Judge W.
L. Comstock, Mankato, candidates
for associate justice (two to be elect
ed); Justice Royal A. Stone, St. Paul,
and Justice Andrew Holt, Minneap
olis; Judge John A. Rosser, St. Cloud.
Candidates for district judge; Judge
Charles E. Callahan, Rochester.
You will notice that O. P. P. Ja
cobson’s name does not appear in
the foregoing list of candidates for
governor. This does not mean that
he is not considering the governor
ship, but I have it on good authori
ty, that shortly he will betake him
self to the office of Mike Holm and
sign the dotted line on a document
which will be presented to him in the
state auditor's office at his request.
F. W. Matson, an official of the rail
read and warehouse commission, for
merly commissioner of public safety
in St. Paul, will file for re-election in
the near future.
Capitol gossip has it that all the
present office holders ol the state ad
ministration will come out for re
nomination and re-election. Those
who are close to Attorney General C.
L. Hilton tell me that he is hesitating
whether to come out as a candidate
for re-election or for election as as
sociate justice of the supreme court.
Many close friends of Mr. Hliton are
urging him to go after the higher
position.
Some seem to think that Edward
Inderhus, former Democratic candi
date for governor, will make the race
for congress in the sixth congression
al district and that he will be able to
satisfactorily get around what now
appear as legal obstacles. Represent
ative Harold Knutson is not expect
ed to be a candidate for re-election.
Senator C. Rosermeter of Little Falls,
former county attorney of Morrison
county, will no doubt become a can
didate for congress in the sixth dis
trict. Peter J. Seberger, a St. Cloud
real estate man, may file for con-
Kess in the sixth district on the
>mocratic ticket. And so the polit
ical pot boils and boils and boils.
Alton Klan Will Soon
Dedicate New Klavern
ALTON, ILL., April I.—Kristy
Klan, No. 87, Realm of Illinois, held
its last regular meeting at the Odd
Fellows’ hall.
“In the future all members and
visiting Klansmen will come to our
new Klavern which has recently been
purchased on Main street, near Bost
wick, in upper Alton,’’ according to
an announcement by an official of
the organization. “We are getting
prepared for one of the biggest
blowouts’ Alton has ever had since
the Klan started here. It will be
the night of the dedication of the
new home.. All candidates will be
withheld until that date.”

history, and in time to come will be
read as an epic, like Homer is read
now, it was a work of art. a literary
gem, if you please.”
Governor Allen, who endeavored to
hive the Klan driven from Kansas
through his attorney general, was
referred to. “Allen came to Indians
some time ago to speak for Beveridge,
a candidate for United States sena
tor. To Allen goes the credit for
electing Samuel Ralston of that
state to the senate poet.
Mayfield Popular
“Likewise the decent people of
Texas put Senator Earle Mayfield in
office. Mayfield is the most looked
up to senator in congress today.”
A look at the duties of citizenship
from a new angle, was presented by
the Imperial Wizard. He said: "The
citizenry of America has not been on
the job. The nation owes much to
its citizens, but do not forget that
the citizens owe much to the nation.
This government must indeed be
made a government of, for and by
the people. A citizens dutv to his
country is second only to that duty
to Almightv God.
"Get right with God and nothing
can stop l ' you from sweeping on to
victory. No excuse is needed for do
ing the right things by your God,
vour country and your home —it takes
backbone. And don’t forget that one
with God and right on his side can
sweep all before him. no matter how
great the obstacles.” At the introduc
tion of his address Dr. Evans declared
that the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
were either an accident or the carry
ing out of the will of God.
Only Sick In Parts
He then outlined the trials the
Klan had gone through. He mention
ed the dissensions that the papers de
clared were dwindling the member
ship of the Klan. “You will recall
reading a few months back where
eight states seceded from the na
tional organization. These ‘rebellers’
—that isn’t good English but its
good sense —met in Atlanta for a
conference —the whole 150 of them.
Doctors say that boils prevent an in
dividual from acquiring worse dis
eases. That is the situation with the
Klan. The Klan has never been more
than sick in places and it has not
taken us long to cure it.
“The enemies of freedom and right
are organized in America. Now the
Klan has organized the forces of good
and order. The Klan is the putting
of patriotism into daily service.”
TTie state meeting was the largest
and most enthusiastic ever held in
the history of lowa Klankraft.
King Kleagle Presides
The King Kleagle of the state,
known and loved by all his colleagues
and lowa Klansmen as “Andy” pre
sided. Representatives from every
Klan in lowa were present, making a
total of approximately 300 men at
the meeting.
Dr. Evans gave a short talk at the
morning session. On the platform
with him was P. S. Etheridge, Imper
ial Klonsel; Walter P. Bossert of In
lianapolis, head of the propogation
work in northern states; P. K. Lyle
and W. K. Campbell of the Imperial
staff.
The Klansmen of Blackhawk county
in the morning presented “Andy”
with a mounted silver loving cup as
a tribute of their esteem for his
work and efforts.
“Andy” Best Man
At the afternoon session, Dr. Evans
in the course of his address, declared
that the national office had sent the
“best man we could find to lowa. He’s
not a angel he’s an honest-to-God
he-man,” the Imperial Wizard assert
ed, taking “Andy” by the arm and
bringing him to the front of the
platform. He was greeted with ap
plause and cheering, which conclu
sively proved that the Klansmen of
all lowa agree with the opinion of
Dr. Evans.
Short talks were made at the af
ternoon and morning sessions by
prominent citizens men in public
life. Representatives of the various
Klans also made brief announcements
of conditions in their respective
fields of endeavor.
The new Queen Kleagle of the lowa
Women of the Ku Klux Klan made a
short address in the afternoon, out
lining the plans she hopes to carry
out in conjunction with the Protest
ant American women of the Hawkeye
state. . , ,
Mrs. Evans, wife of the Imperial
Wizard and other visiting organizers
were introduced and given a hearty
reception. '
Talks at Klavern
At the Klavern of the Des Moines
Klan, Dr. Evans dwelt more in detail
on subjects of national interest. He
made it clear that he was interest
ed in the Des Moines municipal elec
tion only in seeing that men fit for
public office and worthy of public
trust, were placed in the seats ol
power.
Dr. Evans came to Des Moines from
Kansas, passing through on his re
turn to Washington, D. C. He was in
Davenport on Monday and addressed
three audiences there, after the
Eagles had cancelled a contract with
a representative of the Klan giving
the use of their hall for the meeting.

RED WING, MINNESOTA, KLAN PASSES
RESOLUTION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT
RED WING, MINN, March 26.
The Red Wing order of the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan drew up and
passed a resolution for law enforce
ment that is definite and determined
in its language. And there can be
no doubt left in the minds of the duly
constituted officers of the law in
Goodhue county as to the position of
Klansmen here, so far as law en
forcement is concerned.
The resolution was given to the
public as a paid advertisement ap-
Karing in The Red Wing Daily
gle dated March 16. Needless to
say, the resolution has created a sen
sation and opened the eyes of a large
number of people who have been
waiting on the side lines ready to
join hands with their friends and
neighbors who have been working
fearlessly for better things. Many
have already expressed themselves
as ready to do that which they have
delayed for some time, namely, be
coming members of the great Prot
estant order.
Text ol Resolution
We reprint as following, the resolu
tion as it appears in The Red Wing
Daily Eagle:
“Whereas ,the grand jury of the
county of Goodhue and state of Min
esota, at its last session made a com
medable effort to bring violators of
law to justice, and in so doing, did re
turn several indictments against di
vers alleged law violators requiring
them to appear before the court to
answer for their alleged violations of
the laws of this state;
‘Therefore, be it resolved, that we
Klansmen of Red Wing, Minn., Ku
Klux Klan in regular meeting assem
bled on this 14th day of March, 1924,
do hereby heartily approve of the
work performed by said grand jury;
that said grand jury is entitled to the
thanks of the community in the com
mendable work in seeking to enforce
respect for law.
“That we as law abiding citizens
of this community favor the enforce
ment of all laws, and those who vio
late the laws of the state or the na
tion, without regard to person, be
brought to justice by a speedy trial
before an impartial court, and re
ceive the punishment that they de
serve to the end that their example
may deter others from violations of
the law, and that there may be a
more wholesome respect for law and
that law be obeyed for the good of
orderly government and the welfare
of the community.
Don’t Usurp Law
"We do not believe in taking the
law into our own hands; we do not
believe that any person or persons
whatsoever should take the enforce
ment of law into his or their hands,
and therefore, we most cheerfully
uphold all officers of the law in the
enforcement of law, in the perform
ance of their duties, and pledge them
our united supnort.

"While we are aware that an in

against anyone is not a presumption
ot guilt, yet we believe that all al
leged offenders be prosecuted to tha
full extent of the law, and that no

NINE FIERY CROSSES
BURN IN OWATONNA
OWATONNA, MINN., March 25.
Department stores everywhere are
announcing spring openings and care
fully arranging tneir wares for pros
pective buyers. It is natural that
they should do this. Spring is here!
So are the robins and the Ku Klux
Klan open air meetings.
Nine fiery crosses were burned
throughout Owatonna recently, and
according to current rumors, the
burning symbols announced the open
ing of the Steel county Klan. The
Klansmen of southern Minnesota have
been working hard all winter increas
ing their membership strength. At
this time there are so many Klans
men in and around Owatonna that if
the “outsiders” living in Steel county
knew for a certainty their numerical
strength, they would betake them
selves to other parts, because so many
here have an entirely erroneous con
cepton of the great Protestant Amer
ican organization.
You may look for many interesting
meetings in the outdoors just as soon
as the weather permits. Plans are al
ready being made for a large public
open air naturalization ceremony to
be held in Owatonna. When the fclan
gala day of Steel county is announced
Kluxers from all parts of the state
and even from outside the state, will
be urged to come here for a real good
time. Visiting Klansmen will never
forget the fellowship and hospitality
of Steel county Klansmen. We never
do anything here by halves, so rest
assured that the public naturaliza
tion ceremony will be a humdinger
and filled throughout with thrills.
