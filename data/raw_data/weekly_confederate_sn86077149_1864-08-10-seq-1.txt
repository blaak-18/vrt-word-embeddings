slimy how truthful are Mr. Holden 's reinirk

"In Cook's brigade, the 27th gave Holden

Editors Confederate Sirs: As an effort
las been mde by B. F. M.ore and the Edi
tor of the Pregrtzs, to show an analogy or
identity of principle .between the Heroes of
Amerna and the order f Frc- Masons, I -desire,
us a Master in-on and member i, the
Grand Inlg", to enter my protest against it.
Being my member of th II. O. A., 1 can only
judge of it by what 1 see in fhe papers. Iut
to give yon the principles ' i f Masonry , it is
only necessary the following inierrogaloiits
to tl p Master of a Ldge, iai Lis investiture,
should be enumerated : . .
" 1st. You agree to be a peaceable subject,
and cheerfully to Conform to the laws of (he
country in which jou reside?
"2od. You premise not to be concerned in
plots and conspiracies ' g,onst Govercmeu.
but patiently to submit to the supreme legis
lature ?
4,0rd. You agree .to pay a proper re? peel
to the civii magistrate, t.. wrk diligently,
live creditably, and act honorably by all mer:?''
All these -questions the Master must ?.n-f-wer
in the niilimative, btfore he can be in
stalled. Acaitf, in tbe cha'ge to an entered appren
tice, you will find tLe following injunction,
to-wit:
" In the IMate, you art to be a quiet and
cac till eubjtct, true to your government,
and just to your e;'iuftry : you are uot to
oun?enance disloyalty or rebellion, but pa
tiently submit to legal authority, and con
form with cheerfulness to the goVtrnment in
wide liou live.,,
Tnoe are the principles of masonry. If
tbere is any analogy between them and tbos
f tie H. O. A , I cannot perceive it. In
.ict, whoever asserts there is; is a slanderer of
( ur most ancient order "no-re ancient than
the go'di-u fleece or Reman Eag." The j
1 ic r Editor, whom 1 am happy to be sble to
"c)o.vledge as a worthy brotner, can testify
tkat ail I have said above is true. B.
A Sensible Fellow.
A converted sinner of a Holden soldier say
He must be a" d ogged pocr shoat, who
wouldn't vote as -a pretty girl asked him to.
For my part, says he, if any such wants me
tia keep a voting tbe balance of rry life, al
thehsstodo is to stand by. and tell me to
vole.
