Tho Basis of Representation for the
Convention.
From the Shrevoport Times.
The State Central Committee of
tho democratic party of Louisiana,
having disappointed the expecta
tions and wishes of the people of
the country parishes in caliing a
State democratic convention to as
semble in New Orleans on the
fourth Wednesday in August, and
iu Assuming to organize tho demo
cratic party in the opening cam
paign ; and there being no organ
ized body authorized to call a con
vention of tho white people of the
State, we, believing that wo repre
sent in (his matter, tlio wishes of
ninety nine one-Iiundrcdths of our
whito fellow-citizes, suggest :
That tho several parishes
throughout the Slate, and the sev
eral wards in the ci ( y <>t New Or
leans, elect or appoint delegates to
a Convention of the White Peoph
to assemble in Alexandria, in Ka
pides parish, Tuesday, the first day
of September, 1874, to nominate
State Treasury and members of
Congress for tho several Congres
sional districts ; to thoroughly or
ganize the white peoplo of Louisi
ana for the redemption of the State
from the control ot ignorant, cor
rupt and incapable men, and to
promulgate, a platform explaining
to the world the true aims and ob
jects of tho white man's party to be,
not the deprivation of any class ol
their rights and liberties, but the
establishment ot a just and econotn
ieal government in the Slate, tor
the protection of (ho interest«,
rights and liberties ot all men w i( 11
in its borders, irrespective of race
color or previous condition of servi
tilde.
That the basis of representation
for (he Convention of tho white
people shall be the same as the rep

Protection Against Cotton Insects,
Returns have been received from
one hundred and soventy different
counties in tho cotton growing States
Alabama and Texas being represent
ed by tho most numerous and com
plete statements. Of these, one hun
dred reported that no experiments
with Paris green, ^r arsenical pre
parutions, had been tried; many were
Iron: counties in which little cotton
is ever grown, and others were from
counties where the worms havo never
appeared.
1. E fficacy of P aris G reen .—Of
the seventy returns reporting actual
experiment a largo proportion, at
least four-fifths of all, declare the
success, cither full or partial, of the
application of mixtures of Paris green
or other arsenical compounds, when
they ;iro properly applied. Some are
content with the simplo declaration
that it is an effectual* remedy.
Where it is most generally used it :'s
most approved. In New Iberia, La.
«here a machine that will powder
15 to 18 ncres per day is in use, it is
said that fifty planters have found it
successful. la Wilkinson, Mississ
ippi where a simplo compound of
Paris green and flour was used, "rows
treated with the compound were
healthy and vigorous, while neglect
ed rows beside them were destroyed.'
In Landry, Texas, "one application
of Paris green in solution resulted in
ten additional bales in a field of «î5
acres, over tho rate of production in
other fields where none was used
A similar result is reported from
Montgomery, Texas, by tho use of
Paris green mixed with lime or plas
fine
ter, or even fine sand, where
neighbor has picked already ten
bales of 500 pounds each from 13
acres, while freedmen on tho fame
farm lost their whole crop by refus
ing to iu:c it." The correspondent
iu Worth County, Ga., declares it
"was death to everything that eats
tho leaves that havo been sprinkled."
Somo correspondents enjoin the ne
cessity of repeated applications to
meet the appearance of successive
broods of worms, as enough are left
after the most careful application to
perpetuate the noxious race. In some
cast#, caution is suggested not to
inako the application after tlio bolls
aro open, lest it becomes "dangerous
to picker and ginncr." In the cases
or failure mentioned there appears
no evidence that tho application wns
properly and persistently made, and
with a pure article of Paris grecy.—
In some cases where it killed both
worms and plants, it is very evident
that tho proportion of Paris green
was too largo or applied too heavily.
C onclusion .—Fiom tho answers to
the various questions above quoted,
tho following is a summary of the
conclusions:
The use of Paris green, when pure
and unadulterated, mixed with flour
in the proportion of 1 part of Taris
green to 25 to 30 parts of flour, is of
utility, and in many cases has saved
tho crops; thet in many instances
where the Paris green has failed it
has been attributed to improper use
or using a spurious article. Paris
green or arsenic, also used with wa
ter and sprinkled over tho pjants,
has been used with good effect, but
,o be of any avail tho water must be
well mixed up and stirred at, the time
of using it, as the Paris green or ar
senic is only partially soluble in wa
ter, and requires to bo thoroughly
disseminated throughout tho water,
to be deposited as a slight coating of
poisonous powder ou the leaves to be
ot any avail When Paris green or
arsenical compounds are used great
carc must bo taken not to mako the
mixturo too strong, or they will kill
or injure the leaves and plants.
When used as a powder dusted over
tho plants, the plants must be wet in
order to make tho powder adhere to
the leaves. Bains will wash the mix
ture away from tho leaves, and it will
have to bo renewed after heavy show
ers. Somo glutinous or sticky sub
stance may bo used with the Paris
green and flotfr in order to cause it
to adhere to the leaves, but it is not
necessary. Sour or spoiled flour will
answer as well as the best; plaster,
ashes, and even dust have, in some
cases, been substituted for the flour,
but has not answered tho purpose as
well as the flour. Applying the Par
is green on tho first appearance of
tho caterpillars is reccommended—
and as soon as possible after the se
coud crop of worms appears on the
plants also. No notice lias been tak
en of patent insect-destroyers, as the
patentees claim a private and exclus
ive right to use them. Only a very
few cases of injury to man or beast
have been observed, and even some
of those cases are not well substan
tiatcd by proof. It, however, would
bo well to caution persons using tu is
poison to be on the windward side
when dusting or showering it on tl
plants, and not, to let stock in to feed
upon the foliage. Tho prejudice of
tho negroes against using Paris green
is now partially removed. Tho ap
plication of Paris green not strong
enough to injure tho cotton will kill
the beggars' lieo weed in tho rows
One or two of the favorable accounts
of tho success of Paris green in cer
tain localities must bo considered
however, as occuring in the same
neighborhoods where tho worms
mysteriously disappeared in neigh
boring fields without tho aid of the
poison. Pires arc said by some plant
ers to bo of use in attracting and
destroying tho moth or miller, and
by others to be injurious, as attract
ing moths from neighoring planta
tions; and it has been observed that
the cotton has been very much at
tacked immediately around such fires
afterward, as if the mollis had been
attracted by tho firo and deposited
their eggs in tho vicinity. Torches
aro of no avail unless generally used
y all the planters in a neighbor
hood, except when placed over pans
or dishes containing some adhesive
substance, and into which they fall.
Great complaints have been made
by planters ubout°the indiscriminate
destruction of insectivorous birds
. O
which ought to be protected by law,
as they are exceedingiyBseful in des
troying tho cotton caterpillar.—
Si me planters used salt-water in the
proportion of a gill to a bucketful—
aid thought tùey experienced bene
ficial results from its use, while
thers ploughed between tho rows
with pine brush fastened to the sin
le-treo in order to sweep off the cat
rpiliars from the plants into the
ground, where they are either buried
under the earth or scorched to death
before they aro able to rcascend the
plants. Kerosine oil crcsylic soap,
ind other preparations havo been
used, but to no great extent, though
with somo bénéficiai results. Tur
keys driven into the field, as in the
ase of tobacco worms in Maryland
uid Virginia, will quickly extermin
ate many of tho caterpillars, and
have been highly spoken of by three
of our correspondents.—Monthly Be

The State Convention.
From the Shrevoport Times.
We publish to-day a call for a
State convention of the white men
of Louisiana to assemble at Alex
andria on the first day of Septem
ber next. The action of the Dem
ocratic State Central Committee
has so completely disappointed the
expectations of the people, and the
policy it lias maiked out, is so cal
culated to dampen ^tho newly
aroused enthusiasm throughout the
country, that submission to it will
seal the ruin of Louisiana. We have
therefore taken the responsibility
of calling such a convention as we
know a largo majority of the white
people desire to assemble.
In taking this responsibility we
are not assuming to dictate to oui
fellow-citizens, nor are we arrogat
ing to ourselves superior authority
or wisdom in this matter; but tho
Democratic Central Committee
having ignored tho wishes of our
people, and there being no author
ized body to make this call we
have assumed to make it, believing
that we are giving expression,
shape, authority and circulation to
the wishes of the whito people of
tho State.
We most earnestly solicit the co
operation of our conteinpories
throughout the State in gettingjip
this convention. A large number
ol them have already endorsed our
suggestion for a convention at Al
exandria, and this call simply gives
shape to that suggestion.
If all the papers, favorable to
this movement, join us in this call
the result will be a convention call
ed by the people, representing the
people, and expressing the wishes
of the people. .
Let us then go earnestly into this
work; any falteringnow will insure
our defeat. 'Ibis movement lias
gone so far that unless it is carried
out, it will divide our strength.
The Democratic Central Committee
had no right to intrude a different
line of policy upon us at this late
day, and it must be forced to recede
from its factious position. Eveiy
man then to his post; let every pa
per in the State do its duty in this
canvass, and before the assembling
of the Convention in September all
factious opposition will be quelled;
there will bo harmony in our ranks
and wo will present a united front.
IT It is reported that a new
plank is to be inserted in the Re
publican platform in South Caroli
na, iu consequence of an unpleas
ant accident to a colored voter who
became the victim of a spring gun
while endeavoring to commit a bur
ary. A meeting of colored citi
zens, after a full discussion of that
lamentable occurrence, unanimous
Jy resolved against hereafter giving
their support to any candidate for
office, and especially for the Legis
lature, unless he will pledge him

bill making it a penal offence to
set a trap gun in the vicinity of any
corn crib, chicken coop, smoke
house, or pig stye.

t? 3 The Trustees of the insolvent
Freedman's Savings Bank have at
last determined to close up the
business of the concern, and will
place its effects in the hands of a
board of commissioners, as author
ized by a recent law of Congress.
The President, Frederick D oug
lass , lately published a long letter
to deposit<4£ urging them to con
tinue their deposits, while at tho
same time he admitted that on Jan.
1 the liabilities of the bank exceed
ed its assets to tho extent of over
$200,000. In reality, tho tleficien
cy will probably prove to be far
greater than is yet acknowledged,
for among the items classed as re
sources are many which cannot be
turned into cash except at a greai
reduction of the value set upon
them in the reports of the bauk offi
cers. Mr. Douglass says that
most of the loans have been rnado
in the District of Columbia, which
is not calculated to inspire confi
dence in tho nature of the securi
ties pledged for their redemption.
Indeed it has long been a mat
ter of open scandal that the savings
of the poor negroes had in large
amounts found their way into the
hands of men connected with tho
rascally District Ring ; and two or
three years ago The Sun called at
tention to the mismanagement of
the institution, and protested
against the plunder of tho confiding
freedmen by those who assnined to
be their special friends. Tho
branch iu this city was closed be
cause it could not pay a demand of
$531, and that is a sufficient com
mentary ojn the general manage

The Smallest Steam Engine
in the World .—An ingenious
(Mass.) mechanic, D. A. A. Buck,
by name, has constructed a com
plete little steam engine of tho fol
lowing extraordinary liliputiou di
mensions: The Engine, Boiler,
Governor aud Pumps stand in a
space 7-lGths of an inch square, or
the area of a silver three ceut piece
and 5-8ths of an inch high, contain
ing 148 distinct parts, mostly çg
Göhl and Silver, fastened together
with 52 screws, the largest of which
is l-80th-of an inch, and the small
est about 1-100th of an inch in size.
All the bearings are supplied with
regularly turned oil cups. The
boiler is supplied with a safety
valve. There are all tho Valves—
Gearing, etc., to bo found upou an
ordinary Horizontal Engine, Boiler,
Governor and Pumps, and all work
admirably. Threo drops ot water
fill the boiler to its proper capacity.
The Engine alone weighs but 15
grains; the whole together, includ
ing base, but 2 dwt 18 grains, Troy
weight. Diameter of Cylinder—
1-lGtli inch, Length of Stroke 3-32.
T he G rangers— We learn from the
energetic Deputy for this Parish and
Vernon, Mr. Joseph H. Hynson, that
he lias within the last few weeks or
ganized two more Granges on the
North sido of Red River. «This is
right and wo are only sorry that the
number is two, instead of twenty a
week. This side of the tiver seems
to be slow about getting up their
lists. Wo have heard of several,
however, in the process of prelimina
ry organization over here and have
no doubt but that they will spr&g up
briskly this Fall, when money gets a
little more plentiful than it now is
among our planters. We would like
to see every planter in theParish be
long to the order and then they
could control the labor question as
it ought to be controlled by them.
