"ONCE MORE TiE INSIDIOUS PERUNA"
The following is a copy of an edit
orial clipped from the New Orleans
States, issue of March 26:
"A few days ago the States published
an editorial containing comments more
or less lightsome on the rude invasion
which the exhilarating beverage known
as Peruna has made in the prohibition
districts of Mississippi and North
Louisiana, where failure to attend
church with punctilious regularity is a
crime, and to be discovered with a
flask of Pike's Magnolia in your clothes
means banishment from the community. i
We are gratified to note that the edit-i
orial referred to has- produced an echo
in the form of the following letter from
a very 'frank an 1 truthful minister of
the gospel who in some way has man
aged to get 'a straight line' on Peruna
and who is well acquainted, evidently,
with its ingredients and its potency.
The minister says:
"'A friend having called my attention
to your recent editorial, entitled "The
Perunaic Curse," I wish to express my
gratification at the stand which you,
together with the Lafayette Gazette
and Ruston Leader, have taken to ex
pose this disguised intoxicant. I have
been fighting thi0s form of liquor for
some time, both ii public discourse and
private endeayor. The saddest feature
to me is the endorsement given to Pe
runa and kindred "remedies" by promi
nent men, especially ministers of the
gospel, who are thug, unconsciously
pei'haps, aiding the infamous liquor
traffic and Icontrit.tting to the great tide
of kntemperance .
"4Peruna. contains from oo to 75 per
cent of alcohol, and is far more intoxi-I
eating than wine, beer or whiskey. S"
it is with all the so-called "tonics.
They are composed chiefly of alcohol,
a$d the unsuspecting victim, allured by
*L recommendation- of ministers and
religious press which advertises
se intoxicants, acquires the alcohol
it before he is aware of it. I have
told by a druggist that women buy
these "tonics" because of their stimulat
ing eects. It is so much more respect
/e to get tipsy on Peruna than on
lain old Bourbon or rye l
"'Just here let me aIso utter a warn
ig against narcotics like "Mrs. Wins
low's Soothing Syrup," which is com
poed priacpally of opiunm Helpless
iasafn and children are dosed with
tre vile decoctions, ad thus are
trained up to become alcohol and drug
iends. What an awful responsibilityi
rests upon. those who, by example and
ierv are thus aiding the devil in
hisdirty work t
"* .i did not expect the secular press
to cry out against this evil, and hence
I am all the tore gratified that it has
the courage to do so.
"'vAx rxAcNG cA ` MINISTER.'
-"We quite agree with our carespond
et, that it is most reprehensible for
ministers -of the gdspel and the reli
gious press to recommend to their
brother and sister mortals such a pow
erful jag-producing extract is Peruna,
and claim that it is a nerve tonic and
a t.ure cure for catarrh. How many
quint 'nips' of Peruna have been taken
in the sanctum of religious weeklies we
can not say, but we do know that many
an humble 'follower of the Lamb' likes
it very much and that it has caused
thousands of them to wander far from
the fold and entirely out of. hearing of
fte belt wether. We weep copiously
Swhen. we think how ministers, presiding
48et and deacons have tasted it -only
to - refreshed and to taste it again.
i of temperance are a unit in
Sof Perua, because it does not
o awith their lodge oblgaties
d t t a e time fills in a most sat-,
a mmaer a lowg-felt want,
~i not a pohiioa state in the
.y..n in rii :Penit a can not bd
,i all t ol drsior Ã½ and .where
dfor it is Svery large and
spavis !is tas e to the
P 'ayts
and Peruna is the only remedy which
the druggist is able to recommend that
will afford the desired relief, and we
are forced to admit that it never misses
a shot. This statement is nmde advised
ly. because several years ago we lin
gered with a devoted friend and a bot
tle of Peruna one evening in a country
town which was operated entirely by
preachers who had recommended Pe
runa as the only safe household medi
cine. That occasion will ever remain a
bright yet painful spot in our mind.
The hilarity exceeded three days and
the headache two weeks; hence we can
talk learnedly of the virtues of Peruna,
as our distinguished correspondent
"Evangelical Minister" fully appreci
ates. His letter shows quite clearly that
he knows by experience exactly what is
in Peruna and what it is capable of per
forming when the cork is pulled- and
the fragrant fluid is unleashed. We vio
late no confidence when we say that
there is no variety of jag desired that
Peruna can not quickly produce. It is
equal to all emergencies and satisfies
all customers. It is recommended b3
ministers, because when they desire in
spiration for an effective sermon all
they have to do is to take three full
doses every ten minutes. It never fails
to act, because it was compounded es
pecially for action.
"We must, in closing this- article, as
sure our correspondent that we are in
cordial agreement also with his views
regarding soothing syrup, but we are
constrained to remark that iri the prohi
bition districts of North Louisiana and
Mississippi soothing syrup is at a dis
count; it is even more than 'a drug on
the market, because teething and' fret
ful children are' lulled into sleep by the
soporific effect of an old-fashioned
spanking. Peruna has the right of way
everywhere, and the man who dares to
raise a hand or a voice against this
much-needed family medicine, -which
has been so cordially and publicly en
dorsed by the church, is sure to breed a
revolution."
We quite agree with the States and
would odd that if one is disposed to get
on a jag he should tackle the genuine
red-eye, labeled "snake poison," if you
will, and "full up" as ia gentleman.
Why should any man having a cliim to
decency tank up on Peruna or medicat
ed alcohol when he can get the best old
rye or Bourb.n full proof and warrant
ed pure? But the States is not alone in
its condemnation of this "Perunaic
Curse," sipce getting drunk on medi
cated stuff in prohibition districts has
aroused the protests of a number of
newspapers throughout North Louis
iana and other- sections of the country.
For instance, the Ruston Leader is au
thority for the statement that "three
fourths of the drunkenness and disor
derly conduct' in Ruston is traceable to
the excessive drinking of Peruna."
The Lafayette Gazette says: "The
demon of intemperance has made his
appearance in the prohibition districts
of North Louisiana. This time the
Wh-iskey devil is disguised in Peruna
bottles, guaranteed to cure all the ills
that flesh is heir to. Newspaper readers
need not be told what Peruna is. It is
not only claimed tp be a panacea Jor all
bodily ailments, but it enables hundreds
of congressmen and governors to get
their pictures in the newspapers. Were
it not for its advertisements it is safe
to say that many worthy statesmen
would. never see their likenesses printed
in the papers andl would be condemned
to go out of public life unknown to
fame and printers nk.
"But Peruna does more than, that.
Besides curing all the diseases of man
tad affording to politicians an easy- ve
hicle to immortality, it is a very suc
cetsful spbstitute for 'booze."
Another authority on this subject
says: "In prohibition towns and dis
trictshere the jug trade is more or
less restricted, Peruna is in great de
saand. The man who gets his whiskey in
the jug will rarely drink to excess, but
if he should become intoxicated on the
genuine article he would be condemned
and perhaps held for some violation of
law, but any one in a prohibition town
or district may get tanked up on Pe
runa, which can produce any effect de
sired from a fighting drunk to a-give
away-the-whole-town drunk to a jolly,
poetical, singing, dancing, or a regular
"snakes-in-your-boots" drunk. It is no
wonder that Peruna (and other medi
cated stuffs) is popular and in demand
since any gentleman, regardless of his
profession, can have about him the
ready and the ha;;dy black bottle from
which he can soothe his catarrh or clear
his throat of cobwebs. At any #tte, it
seems to satisfy the craving of some
people who declare it is sinful to take a
nip of old rye or Bourbon, which only
the wicked drink. But the question is
how to repress and suppress the medi
cated stuffs loaded with drunks, "raise
hell" and bust-heads."

Tucker.

at 4 o'clock. Miss Ethel Perroncel and
Mr. Joseph H. Tucker were married at
