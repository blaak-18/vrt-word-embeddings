Dear Sir:---The Louts&NA Poi'
tLIST pays its Nwc l, lv visits to this
)lche :and I cee letters from all
part- of the country save this. `o
I wil! write you a few lines to let
the people know that we are still on
the land and among the livinz.
The heavy hand of affliction is
pressing us very hard indeed and
it is pressinf every hit of socalled
democracy oult of the people and
making Populists out of tnem.
They are not coiing to us from
a party t.hndp(,int, but tecauie the
Peoples party voices the lx)lular
thought of the Americanu pe.ople.
T'hey hein to think they could
make a few silver d!ltar- of some
uSe4' to the'li]vc".
Th-'v h 'e legunll to see the dan
ger of National banks.
They' also say they don't care so
much about owning the railroads.
hut they say the railrods are about
to own them, and they Isgin to
want to '-pFlit th1l- diffcrenc" with
them.
1 want to say ri.ght here that if
the Populist demands were enacted
into law, it would not be long un
til every.-pJerson could have a home
that w~inted it, and twere would not
he so nawyv famlfilies out in the
snow which is nov two inches deep
on the grotlld.
There are a great many families
who have no home and biut very
little-of anything at present to live
on.
I want to say that I was called
away from home a short time ago
to attend to some business in an
other periib, and I spent the night
with one of the pleasantest. families
I have over met. Mr. A., his wife
4hree girls andI one boy, four of as
tine children as I ever looked upon
but the hand of affliction had boon
playing its part in that home and the
father and mother and children did
not have clothes enough to keep
them warm in the mild days of
November, and they had just
enough to eat to keep them from
starving.
L asked how he had ;een voting
and he told me that he had voted
the democratic ticket all the time.
I asked him what he thought of
the Populist demands, and he told
me he knew nothing about them.
I explained them as best as I could
and promised to send him some re
form literature to read, and the
m'n seemed to be very hopeful.
I inquired of the neighborhood
and found that it was in the same
-condition as this man.
This convinced me of the neces
tity of sending both literature and
men to lecture in places where the
people are not educated in the re
form movement.
Eduecte and elevate them and
not until them will the light of
freedom begnm to shine and the
chains of bondage be broken.
Yours for reform,
