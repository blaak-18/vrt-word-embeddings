care. We thought nothing of it. I
do not know that we even knew we
- saw such things, but some of them
come to me as I sit with you and talk
of that long day. We did not notice,
and we did not think that at any
moment we too might have our heads
blown off or be smashed into little
pieces like the breaking of a jug.
‘ ‘ Once, when we rushed over the big
guns and killed the men who still
fought with us, we turned the guns
to fire on the Austrians as they flew
away, but they had driven bits of
steel into the touchholes, and so we
could not fire them. They were of a
courage, those Austrians.
“Only once in all that battle did I
think much of what I saw or heard,
and that was when there was the
terrible screaming of a captain who
had his foot shot off. He twisted and
turned as he cried out, and it was a
very bad sound. But it is just as it
chances. I saw many men who were
hurt worse than that captain and
many who were blown into little bits,
but I did not trouble about them. It
is just if it chances so.
“It is very often that a man does
not know that he is hurt. I remem
ber that once there was a man near
me with a great hole in his forehead,
but he ran right on with us with his
bayonet, and I thought, ‘He will fall
dead.’ But after that I saw him no
more, for there was always the fight
ing.
“The storm and the blackness, they
made of us a great mixing. Yes; it
was a very great tangling, for all
lines were lost, and I know that some
times Austrians struck at Austrians
and sometimes Italians struck at Ital
ians, for we were in a very great mix
ing and very fierce in the blackness of
that storm.
“We were told to lie down and
sleep. So we lay down where we
were, among the dead and the wound
ed, among the Italians and the Aus
trians.
“And we slept, Yes; we were
tired, for we had fought hard for all
that long, long day, and on that hill
that at last we had gained we slept,
and we gave no heed to the dead men
or the wounded.
“The wounded they made very
great cries, and there were men sent
to go among them with lights. Some
were surgeons, and some were men to
carry them to the field hospitals. But
the most of us we lay there and slept,
and we were very tired, and we knew
that with the morning there might be
another fight.”—“Sketches From
Memory,” G. A. Storey.

THE WORK OF A GOOD MAN.
What Dr. B. M. Woolley is Doing for
the Sufferers from the Use of
Opium and Whisky.
T / I^, work . s a £°° d man Hve after him.
It is the mission of every living soul to do
way 6 g benefit humanity in some
~A uow and then, here and there, re
alize this great responsibility, and devote
their lives to the salvation of their fellow
nien. One of the most conspicuous exam-
P* es t character in Atlanta is Dr. B.
H , e is a man noted for his
Christian integrity and fair dealing, being
an old and highly esteemed citizen of At
lanta, and having built up a reputation
among his home folks as a specialist in the
cure of the opium and whisky habits that is
or the highest character. Dr. Woolley, un
ike a great many specialists, treats what
is called the opium and whisky habit as a
disease, affirming that they are strictly
disease, and nine times out of ten the suf
ferers are not directly responsible for their
condition. The success he has had in that
line has been something phenomenal. He
has cured patients in every state and ter
ritory in the union, and treated cases in
London, France, Germany, Canada and
Mexico.
Being a man of scholarly attainments, he
has prepared a work on opium and whisky,
and their effects upon the human constitu
tion. In this work he has testimonials of
people whom he has successfully treated
and permanently cured. This book will be
mailed free of charge to your address if
you will only send Dr. Woolley a letter
asking for it. If you are not afflicted with
the opium or whisky disease, probably you
know of a friend or have a relative who is.
If you will kindly send their names or in
form them of Dr. Woolley’s ability, he will
take pleasure in sending them any infor
mation they may desire. Address Dr. B. M.
Woolley, Atlanta, Ga.

Financial Depressions
Periodical financial depressions distress
the country. We call them inevitable; are
they? Is there no cure? Is not the debtor
many simply in panic to pay the creditor
—few ?
The Remedy
is given in-“ Usury; from a Scriptural, Eth
ical and Economic Standpoint,” in which
great book, for the first time in years, logic,
religion, theory and practice are so united
as to demonstrate convincingly that
Usury
is the cause of our recent and every finan
cial distress. The author, Rev. J. C. Elli
ott, strikes heavy blows on present systems.
Interest is the curse of business morality
and business practice.
