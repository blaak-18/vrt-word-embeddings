Iy the simp!e Wino of Cardul Treat
mnlcnt of Female Diseases, thousands of
al:icted women are restored to health
every year. It corrects the menstrual
irregularities from which nearly all
women suffer, and is being universally
used for that purpose now. Ask your
.drugsisnt for Mcl"lree's Wine of Car
dui. Speaking of this class of women
diseases, Miss Laura P. Brown, of
Dalton. Ga., says: '"I have been suf
fering from excessive menses for two
years, constantly getting worse, and I
feel that McElree's Wine of Cardul
has saved my life. I looked forward
to each month and thought I oould
not endure such misery another time.
I can't express my gratitude for the
wonderful relief."

Raise the banner of Populism and

It has been the most mild winter
throughout the country for many,
many years, and the great down-trod

"Wealth belongs to him who creates
It, and every dollar taken from industry
without an equivalent is robbery.'
How does that sound? How does it
suit you? It is found in the Omaha
platform.
The Populists are determined, no
matter what the cost, to have a free
ballot and an honest count in Texas
next November. and the pie eaters may
as well understand the fact right now.
as later on.
Remember that our State convention
meets Aug. 5, and that the Democrats
do not meet until Aug. 18. Push organ
ization, get a club in good working
order, at every box in the State, and be
ready for the fray.
The Culberson tax enters are in a
close place. Reader, compare your tax
receipt for 1895 with those of former
years. "Why, taxes were higher than
ever before," you say. Yes, it reminds

But, honor bright, what is the differ,

thus: "The money power and the mo- I

surrender without an effort for justJee

Wonder how much "boodle" the en

the Nicuaragua canal scheme? The
people should watch as well as pay.
If you want an cffice at Washington,
and there is no place vacant, do like N.

blame N. Q., for he was powerful

The postoffice Is a government insti
tution, and no one ever hears of tho
mail clerks striking or starving to
death, or organizing a scheme to run
the government. Now, really, non t
you think government applied to the.

That would stop the issuing of watered
stock and the making of millionaires.
Guess Rcpuhb:cans in Texas are get
ting too numerous. We not only have
the "Lilly Whites," but the "Black-and
Tans" split wide open at Austin. Here
is a leson for the Populists. We must
set down on the dissenter, the d'sturb
cr, the man who thinks he is the party
at once and hard. l'he Democra,s and
Republicans having no principles at
stake-caly hunting pie-can afford to
split, but Populists cannot.
There are a class of men wh- claim

thus gives them a standing, and fur

pecially true of a Chicago paper.
The United States mints have issued
over a billico one cen: pieces, says the
Chicago Express, which after receiving
the stamp of the government is *orth
and passes curent in the business of
the clin:ry for ten million dollars,
yet the metal of which these were made
would cell, by the pound, for less than
$500,000. It will be seen that at least
$9,500,000 of the currency value of this
moaey is pure fat. Law makes money.
Entirely too many reformers are wor

purchases. Stand by, advocate and

Baroness Rothsechild's Farm.
Baroness Adolphe de Rothschild may
fairly claim to be a fin de stecle agri
culturist. She keeps a farm at Bou
logne-sur-Seine, just outside the Bols,
and here during the summer it is her
delight to initiate the weary votaries
of fashion into the simple pleasures of
rustic life. The guests are welcomed
into a Louis XV. drawing-room, where
the furniture is covered with satin bro
cade of the palest bluish pink hue, and
all the knicknacks and engravings are
suggestive of the ancient regime. One
of the walls, however, consists of a
huge sheet of plate glass, giving viewi

within which a double row of "milky
mothers" browse peacefully at their
marble mangers.
