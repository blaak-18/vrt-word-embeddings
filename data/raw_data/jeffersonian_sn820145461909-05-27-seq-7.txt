against time-honored custom requires
t-he courage of iai true soldier, but
every age has had its hero in the
cause of right and, thank God, the
20th century has given us, in your
self, the bravest knight of the Army
of Right.
You have the preachers in a stir
on the mission question, and tlhere’s
bushels of fun in the way they
are foaming at the mouth. I am a
Missionary Baptist and believe in
missions. There is much food for
thought in your treatise on this very
important question, and I believe the
public will be greatly benefited by
the airing of this question. Your re
ply to Brother Scoville in tlhe cur
rent issue of the Jeffersonian is a
peach. Funny, isn’t it, how the breth
ren lose their temper and make reck
less statements about the “Old
Man?”
Turn on the light. All fair-minded
men want the truth and will wel
come it from any source.
I long to see the day when men
will look well to 'their own interests
and the interests of tlheir fellow man.
Ignorance is the bane of society, the
fountain of all wrong and the Nestor
of vice.
When men have come to love truth
better than falsehood, right better
than wrong, purity better than vice,
they will rise up en ma®se and put
you in the White House, where I, in
common with many thousands, hope
to see you.
I have received my knife, and 1
am as proud of it as I w'as my first
barlow.
If it didn't have a blade, I
wouldn’t swap it for the best knife
in Georgia.
Sincerely your friend and ad
mirer,
E. H. Anthony.
WILLFUL IGNORANCE.
Douglasville, Ga.
Mr. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear 'Sir: I am painfully moved
whenever I contemplate the ingrati
tude of mankind. It is surprising to
me to think that can be so presump
tions as to say to you, “Go on,
brother, I am with you to the finish.
The people need educating.” I fail
to feel that way about it. If there
is a man in Georgia who is twenty
five or thirty years old that don’t
know the history of corruption and
unjust legislation and oppression of
the producers of wealth of this na
tion, he is willfully ignorant. There
is but a remnant of filie voters of
this State and nation that deserve
better laws than, they now have, and
that remnant is composed of those
who vote for what thev want. Last
fall 17,000 voters in Georgia voted
for better men and means and better
laws. A man ought not to have bet
ter times nor better laws than he
works "for.
Very truly yours,
Parker N. Brown.
FAITHFUL OLD SOLDIER.
Seddon, Ala., May 3, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Inclosed find P. 0. money
order for $3.50; $2 of this amount is
for subscriptions for J. P. Turner,
Seddon, Ala. Please send him both
Jeffersonians. The $1.50 balance is
for renewal of my own subscription,
as per your card of recent date.
I am an old Confederate soldier
and have been a Populist ever since
the party was organized. I think
that I was tlhe first avowed Populist
in this county (St. Clair). I am old
and afflicted and not able to work,
but I always go to the election and
vote my convictions. We gave you
five votes here at our box at last elec
tion out of a poll of 26. Bryan got
10, Taft 11. I have never missed a
number of your magazine or weekly
since you started them.
If this new subscription entitles
me to a knife, send her on.
May God bless you with health and
strength to continue to fight for the
rights of the people.

FROM AN OLD “MERCER BOY.”
Dear Tom: You should not be sur
prised at the anger displayed by the
“chief men in the synagogue” at
your attacks on foreign missions.
Don’t you see that you are trying to
break up their playhouse? Why,
man, Foreign missions is their
“piece de resistance”!
Foreign—that is away off—not
easily investigated. The average
man is like the average horse—capa
ble of entertaining but one idea at
the time. Koap his mind on foreign
missions and he won’t inquire into
'tlhe doings of the priests at home!
See? Moreover, the Chief Priests
control the religious press, and
“Simon says ‘wig-wag. ’ ”
Tom, you have laid your finger on
the tender nerve of the Church
Trust. Keep it up. Answer all the
nasty flings—you can thus keep the
facts before your readers. God bless
you in the work. In this, as in po
litical thought, you are the pioneer.
_ Earnest, honest men everywhere are
praying you God-speed.

A PLAN FOR MERGER OF
REFORM FORCES.
Pauls Valley, Okla.
Mr. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson:—As I see let
ters from so many people throughout
the United States on the question of
a great mass meeting to be called by
the different reformers, and being a
reformer myself, I take, this means of
expressing my views through your
valuable paper, and give my opinions
on a method of coming together as a
Baud of Reformers.
1 want to say that I heartily en
dorse many suggestions that have
been made, and I believe that a mass
meeting should be called of the dif
ferent reform branches that are prac
tically striving for the same purpose,
but have let minor differences keep
us sep trated, that it looks like neither
facile a is going to accomplish any
goo I for the great laboring and pro
ducing masses.
Now, I would suggest that there be
a meeting called not later than the
coming fall, and an invitation given to
all the reform forces, regardless of
their past political affiliations, that
we may come together on a platfonn,
of which I would say that the initia-
TLffersonlan
tive and refendum, the right of recall,
land and transportation, and money
of the constitution, which I believe
that all forces could agree upon such
a platform and start a move that
would absolutely be a successful one,
and bring the such relief to the coun
try as is needful, and necessary.
With such laws as we now have in some
of the States, debarring parties from
the ticket, that failed to receive a cer
tain number of votes at the last elec
tion, there isn’t a reform movement
now that since the last election will
be able to get back on the tickets
in those 'States under their present
name. So with a new start, with the
above platform, it seems to me that
such a move would be the greatest
hope for the general masses, that has
ever been inaugurated.
I see writers suggesting names for
this new move, and as far as I am
concerned most any of them are ap
propriate that have been suggested.
It is not really the names that we are
after, but the principles that we are
mostly interested in.
Hoping that this move will continue
to be agitated until it will arouse
enough sentiment that the meeting
will be called and wishing you and
your paper much success, I remain,
Yours for reform,
J. A. West.
“HURRY UP,” HE SAYS.
Talladega, Ala., April 13, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson. Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: —Enclosed find 80 cents
for which please send me the Jan
uary and April numbers of your mag
azine. The other 60 cents is to be
used any way you think best. I am
willing to pay 50 cents per month to
help defray the expenses of that con
ference. The sooner you can arrange
to call it, the better it will be.
The Jeffersonian is needed in more
homes, and I shall try to send in a
few subscribers when I take my va
cation, which will be sometime in
May or June. You know a man who
works for Uncle Sam has no time to
do anything except the thing he is
hired to do.
Hurry up and call that conference
and lets get to business, but don’t
undertake to bear ail the expenses
yourself. There are thousands of loyal
Populists who will chip in if you will
call for it.
Respectfully,
A. W. Stone.
TURNED OUT OF CHURCH BE
CAUSE HE TALKED AGAINST
FOREIGN MISSIONS.
Rockmart, Ga.,
Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
% Dear Sir: —On the 19th day of
October, 1907, I was turned out of
the church for talking against this
mission business, and I have never
been sorry of it one instant. One of
the men here that voted to turn me
out is working to get your April num
ber of the magazine in the hands of
every one he can. 1 think he is thor
oughly converted. I have been a Wat
son man eighteen years; have voted
for you every opportunity I ever had,
but your editorials on Foreign Mis
sions is doing more good than any
thing you ever wrote.
Fraternally yours,
A. U. Mosley.
