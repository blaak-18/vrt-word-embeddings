We have been shown a letter by an and

raelite also, lhat the "Jews of Nat- or

the author of that statement as an nn- slee
mitigated slanderer, for there exists Al
no truer class, to the interest of this was
section than the Jews.' Whena our city

There can lhe no nIIstion that All Cot
Saints' day- this beaut iful customl which fot r

-| year-has a softening and refiniing inll disti
tllence on the hearts of the children the
of men. It tells frail mortals of their
destiny ; it makes religion a conmfirter S

d drils of human' !ove; it turns the soul Iapp

ts All Souls day, like that of All Saints, 'Biut
is was duly celebrated and observed in our hopi
ir city.' Imposing and solemn ceremonies Mt
ad were peiforined in St. Francis Cathedral,
st which was thronged with citizens, among of ti
whom predominated our fair ladies, who that
ht as is always the case, on such occasions, o
are the first and most devout. In truth
whether in works of love, devotion, self Ml
sacrifices or heroism under the most try- he I
'ltt ing circumstances, woman is ever the T
f,,remost. Religion has no more devout, cros
faithful and constant followers than the stre,
o women of civilized lands. Hal
II The Rt. Rev. B. M. Wilmer, Episcopal thei
Bishop of this State arrived in our city on Tue
Wednesday 6th in the afternoon and held el i
service in Trinity church, the same eve- on
to ning, delivering an eloquent and im- Noti
ies. pressive sermon which was listened to exei
with great attention by a large concourse E
of the citizens. On WBdnesday morn- elc
ing the Bishop, assisted by the Rev. A. J. on
Tafdy, of New Orleans, performed the crat
solemn ceremony of consecrating the bad
church to the services of God as a tem- whi
1 }le of worship, preached a sermon ap- her
5 propriate to the occasion. This ceremo
ny Was also witnessed by a large num
ber her of citizens, prompted, doubtless, to
8- attend,by a desire ta witness this un
usual ceremony. Then followed the
morning service wlhich was concluded by
ted a second sermon on the subject of prayer.
stic In the evening the solemn and impos
as ing ceremony of cotfirmation was ad
iith ministered to fifteen persons, six of the
mm numer being promihent citizens. The
church ,on this occasion, was. well filled
and the Bishop's discourse was , most
eloquent and earnest appeal to the men
as heads of families to likewise become
n the head of the church. His visit was a
at pleasant occasion to the members of the
Episcopal Denomination.
The weather during the presnt week
has been decidedly spring-like dulring
the days, with cools frosty nights.
. This season of the year reminds us
that
oar "Tlh melancholy days have come,
ard, The saldest of the year."
par- The woods have' put on.those indescri
bable changes and intermingling of col
ors, which defy the poet's description or
A. the painter's most artistic touches. Na
gbt ture's coloringS are beyond the imita
tion of human skill or the description of
the most imaginative mind of man.
During the hilarity, fun and frolic
among the citizens on election day, ~on
St. Denis Street, the wooden shed over
isp the pavement of a bnilding in front of
Fontepot's Hotel, suddenly gave way
with a crash. A number of persons were
in, beneath it. H.WA, Wahnlsley our young
Be- and enterprising merchant was among
75 the number. He was leaning against the
on- wall of the building to which it was at
