SALOONS RECI(ED.
Mrs, Nation I:esumes Her Destruc
tion ol Wichita Barrooms.
SHE HAD SOME HELP.
When the Sheriff Attempted to Arrest
_ Her She Slapped His Face and
Pulled !is Ears - Three
Women Placed in JaiL
Wichita. Ka... Jan. 23.-Mrs. Carrie
Nation came I ack to Wichita Monday
after her r-"enlt incarcerationl and the
net result of 10 minutes of her work
Monday afternoon are two wrecked
sali-.ns, the pieces of which were after
ward sold sold for souvenirs.
Mrs. Nation was accompanied by Mrs.
Julia Evans, Mrs. Lucy Wilhoit and
Mrs. Lydia Muntz of tie Topeka
Woman' s Christian Temperance union.
With axes concealed under their clothes
they entered John Burns' saloon on
Douglass avenue and (lid not leave any
liquors or-.igars, as well as the plate
glass windows and doors. With light
ning sp5ed they ran to John lierrig's
saloon and had everything in front of
the r, in including the plate glass win
dows broken when he app<'arte with a
revolver, placed it at Mrs. Nation's
head and said that he would blow out
her brains if she did not desist. She
yielded before the pointed revolver and
with her complnions ran to the Carry
hotel bar where she made her first at
touk on the saloons of Wichita three
weeks ago.
Three policemen met her there and
she struck at Detective Sutton with a
poker. He shoved her aside and a
youth struck himu in the face. A police
man struck the youth and knocked him
down. The-police then overpowered
Mrs Nation and her friends and took
them to the city prison, followed by
2000 people.
Mrs Evans' little daughter pushed
her way through the crowd screaming
and begged for Whe release of her mnother
but the policemen were deaf to her en
treaties.
Chief of Police Nendbon discharged
the prisoners , after they reached the
jail. They made him a promise not to
wreck any more saloons .before noon
today. Citizens are indignant over
their release by the chief.
Mrs. Evans' hand was badly cut by
broken glass. After leaving the city
building Mrs. Nation in the coolest man
nor Ibegan a street lecture to the crowd
that lrad surrounded the city building,
saying she expected to begin saloon
wrecking again at noon tomorrow when
her trpce with the chief of police ex
pires. Shaking her fist at the crowd,
she said: "Men, this is the right arm
of God,and I am destined to wreck every
saloon in your city."
'h- amn_,,nr nrrnmendar a w rcann anrl
The women procurea a wagon ann
rode through the streets singing: "Near
er My God, to Thee," and kindred
hymns. They halted in front of the
saloons they had smashed and held
prayer meetings.
At 10 o'clock Mrs. Wilhoit was arrest
ed at her home without making any re
resistance and taken to the county jail,
where she also was placed in the cell in
the steel rotary next to that of Mrs. Na
tion. When Mrs. Wilhoit was ushered
into the steel cage Mrs. Nation cried:
"halleluajah," and she burst into pray
er. Half an hour later Mrs. Evans was
arrested at her ho-ue, but owing to the
condition of her wounded arm she was
given the jailer's comfortable room.
Mrs. Muntz could not be found when
the officers called at her home.
It is said that a complaint of insanity
will be lodged against Mrs. Nation and
if that fails the men holding insurance
on the plate glass doors and windows
will prosecute her.
The damage done by the women is
estimated at between $1500 and $2000.
David Nation, the husband of Mrs.
Nation, was in the city, but took no
part in the wrecking of the saloons, nor
did he go to the city jairwhen his wife
was arrested.
The affair created intense excitement
and it is estimated that 5000 persons,
men and women, viewed the wrecks.
Slaps the Sherlifs Face.
Wichita, Kas., Jan. 23 .-Mrs. Nation
caused a new sensation here Monday
night by slapping Sheriff Simmons in
the face and taking hold of his ears and
giving him a rough handlinig generally.
Mrs Nation was at the Union station
in the act of buying a ticket to a
neighboring town, when the sheriff
pulled at her sleeve, saying: "You are
my prisoner, madam."
-Mrs Nation turned around and seeing
Sheriff Snnmons, gave him a violent
slap across the face. She followed this
up by taking hold )f his ears-with her
two hands and wringing them viciously.
The Union. station was" filled with
women who began screaming, and tre
mendous excitement followed, as the
sheriff who is a very small man, strag
gled with his powerful antagonist. A
policeman came to his rescue and with
the aid of some bystanders they sac
ceeded in pickinep the the woman in
their arms and placing her in a cab
which was zpidly driven to the county

It is hardly hliev :d that the Vene
