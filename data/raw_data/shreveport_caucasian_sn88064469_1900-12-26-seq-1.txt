His C'ed.
A quaint old hernlit, known as "Eng
fish Jack," has lived for many years in a
little house 'which he calls "The House
That Jack Built," In the White hills,
near Portland, Me. He has been in turn
huster, guide, fisherman and seller of
Indisn curiosities and holds aloof free
the toll and turmoil of life. He loves
most to look at the hills and the sky and
while silently smoking think of the won
der and beauty of nature. "He clings."
says the Portland Telegram, "with child
like consfdeace to the infinite goodness
and knows no fear.
"Once a minister was talking with him
seersning religious thlas happesel
a thwtie AheoM be there is
the mountains alone. 'With 7 asked
Jack, with surprise.
"Summed up in a few words, the creed
et the old man Is: 'I want to be honedt.
.1 want to help every one I can. I must
not kill any beast, flih or bird unless I
.iced food. I must think no wrong of
anybody. and I must envy nobody. I
must use the men about me as I want to
he used. Having done all this, I want to
be still and not trouble myself about the
future.' It is, as Dean Stanley said of
that et Charles Dickeas, 'a simple but all
suSeiest creed.' Lit Jives up to it."

fantry can not bring the war to a close
by sitting tight on the railways and in
the chief towns. The Boer guerrillas
must be hunted down and this can be
done by supplying mounted force with
droves of horses for riding hard and far

for purchases on a large scale for opera

SHEDS HIS SKIN.
"as to Lay of a Days * S*, but
batM' the Only laeoaveatesee.
8. 0. Buaskirk, who works for a garden
!t near Florence, sheds his skin once ev
ery year. Along about the middle of
June the epidermis on the palms of his
hands and the soles of his feet begins to
loosen and harden. whle the scarfakin. or
cuticle, on the remainder of his body
Wlarts to lake of lke dandruff from the
heed Within three weeks the old epider
mis has entirely disappeared, and in its
place Is a new skin, sort, pink and tender.
Basklik is 82 years old; a modest mun
and by no mesas disposed to lbrag of a
function not enjoyed In common with the
rest of matakinud. The fact that Provi
dence bas seen fit to supply him free of
charge with a aew snion suit every 12
mouths he regards as interesting, but a
matter Sot to be discussed freely with a
chases acqualutanen, nor. does he attempt
to Inquire as to the why.,and wherefore
of this bit ef favoritism. He Is not one
to crouch with vulgar eye at the keyhole
of nature's workphop, endeavoring to
steal the seasets of the trade. However,
in the interest of as tien he has several
times nerniItleil physi'iasstoesamine him
ansd was gratified to ktarn that they could
make nothing of thi;. ese. They found
out what he already kae4v-tbat he sheds
hi- skin once a year--tad there their re
searcha ended.
The only inconvenience he suffers is
that be is forced to take a short raEstion
until the new t" rder skin gets hardened.
Ina valis- in his toar Huskirk has sev
eral interesting srnvenirs In the form of
patches of skin which he has shed from
his hands and feet at carious times dur
ing his career, and in every lnstaice these
present perfect outlines of the members
frsm which they came. For example.
the "bark" from the palm of the hand
might easily be mistaken at first glance
for one-l.alf of a glove, as the fingers and
thumb are as perfect reproductions of
tias digits as is possible in a flat surface.
MAoreover, the thick, callouslike skin re
tains the mysterious lines of the hand of
which palnaists make so much.
In this connection there is in the Bus
kirk case a fact which tends to disprove
the entire theory of palmistry, being evi
dence that the lines of the hands change
with time and are not unalterably pre
served, as has been supposed. Among
his grewsome keepshlnea is a piece of
skin taken from hbl right hand when
be was 10 years old. It is observed that,
while the general conformation of the
lines corresponds with that of his right
hand as it is today, still the Individual
lines are lacger now than then, eves
after making allowance for the growth
of the member as s'a whole. Fully P.
third has been addal to the length of the
famous "life" line. It is as if destiny
ad, intended him ortignally to be of
brief existence in this Vale of tears and
had later changed bet saad and conclud

ity.
