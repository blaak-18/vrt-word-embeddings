A GLANCE AT AFFAIRS.
A CONSERVATIVE REVIEW OF
THE SITUATION.
The Operations of Monopelles sad the
Blighting Erect-The Money Trust the
Meet Powerful and Cruel of All-The
Imerease of Crime.
A glance at the sitnation of affairs
and condition of the country. that has
produced universal unrest and given
birth to so many "reform theories"
and allusions to -aristocracy." .piu
tocracy" and -corruption in high and
low places," might be opportune at
this time, if not instructi\e.
That ".perpetuities and monopolies
are contrary to the genius of a free
govcrnment" i, doubtless endorsed
by a large majority of the people of
tile United States, yet they exist and
flourish th-ough the length and
breadth of the country.
Attention is directed first to the
land which is said to be rapidly con
centrating in the hands of the few.
while the army of tenants are rapidly
increasing. In many of the western
states large bodies of agricultural and
pastoral lands are held by alien and
domestic syndicates, not to mention
the extensive holdings of individuals.
In Texas. for illustration, one com
pany owns 3,000.004, acres in a bod .
while one railroad company in tic:s
state was granted, by a Democratic
legislature, an amount of land which,
if in one body, would be one mile wide
and nearly 8000 miles long, or nearly
5,120,000 acres, free from all taxa
tion for twenty-like years from the
date of the grant.
It may not be out of place j'.,t here
to state that the total area of land in
the United States Is 2,297.'1$6,547
acres. Of this 1,002.997,177 acres are
not available, leaving 1,281,089,370
acres available, divided in 1890 as
follows;
tcres
In farms ................. ........... 70.O 5
Owned by railroads . 17816 0101
Owned by aliens. ............... 61.9M0.01u
Owned by speculators .............. ,30.500
Total ...53............. ....... 91 e 7, 5
A simple calculation will show that
at that date we had only 335,6946,995
acres of available land remaining.
It would be well to note here that the
railroads, aliens, and speculators then
owned 22,526,000 acres, most, if not
all of which was then and is now held
for speculative purposes; and, it
might be added, that the desire among
those who have large spims of money
at their command to acquire land in
creases with passing years.
Under existing systems the English,
Scotch and German aliens, with sur
plus capital, seek secure investments
that promise a return to them or their
posterity. Naturally they look to the
United States as being the best field
for such investments, as there is little
left in Europe or Asia that ean be so
easily acquired and at such reasonable
figures, promising at the same time
such large returns.
Aganl, the millions of acres owned
by the railroads might with propriety
be classed with the holdings of aliens,
as the English. Scotch and German,
with a lfew American capitalists, hold
our 6,679,292,613 of railroad bonds,
hence indirectly own the railways
and their lands.
But there are other monopolies,
among which may be mentioned the
oil, meat, grain, telegraph, banking,
whisky, leather, coal, iron, clothing.
glass, sugar, twine, a monopoly of
the gold mines, as also a monopoly of
the silver mines, and a thousand or
more not necessary to enumerate. A
corporation may be, under certain
circumstances, a necessity, but it is
geerally conceded that a monopoly
or trust (which bis several monopolies
comblned) is a curse. There was a
time when owve a retail merchant
was considered a gentleman, a bea
fator in his community, a freeman;
bet all this i changed, uas under the
system inaugurated by the trusts, he
is simply an agent for them, a kind of
toll collector. In some lines of mer
chadise the trusts go so far as to I

gument is quite familiar to those who
, read the reform lit_rature of the day.
and wether true or not, the fact re
mains that we have a money monop
oly or money power. or. if you please,
a financial trust. Through the na
5 tional banks this is made possible.
A borrower is the servant of the
lenader, and so the country banks be
ing borrowers from the larger banks
I of the money centers are ready to
obey every mandate of the organized
money power or bank combine.
Through the concerted action of the
members of the money monopoly the
vol:ime of the currency may at any
time be 'ontracted. The quasi in
dorsemcnt of the government gives
national banks a standing. hence an
ad.autage. over the private or indi
â€¢idual banker, as most people believe
that the government is responsible to
the depositors in case the bank fails.
Such, however, is not the case.
The authority granted by act of
congress to national banks to issue
notes to circulate as money is the
foundation for the money monopoly
of this country. Tney get interest
semi-annually on the bonds held by
the government in trust for the bank
notes furnished, and pay the govern
ment 1 per cent per annum for the
notes. and loan these same notes to
the people at from 1 to 5 per cent per
month, owing to the locality and the
necessities of the borrower, always
discounting the interest from the face
of the loan.
Let a few efforts of this money
monopoly be cited. In I65-t; we had
about 1b5) uer capita in circulation.
Money was plentiful (the banks could
not corner it), business was good.
labor employed, contented and happy
and the country prosperous. This
resulted from the use of home capital,
greenbacks, and the people were com
parmtively free from debt. This did
not suit the money lenders of this
country and Europe, hence a con
spiracy to contract our currency. To
that end congress was beseiged and
on April 12, 1866, an act was passed
providing for the retirement of the
greenbacks. The law authorized the
secretary of the treasury to sell 5-20
bonds and retire the currency, includ
ing the various issues. For each dollar
of bonds sold one dollar of currency
was taken out of circulation. This
process went on for years uninterrupt
ed. It proved to be a bonana to
those able to buy bonds, for subse
quently the bondholders secured the
passage of a law changing the bonds
from a currency debt to a coin debt,
making, it has been said, $800,000,000
by the transaction in the difference
between coin and currency ob
ligations at that date. As
before stated, in 1866-6 the
country was booming, for we had
$1,896,687,900 in circulation. Contrac
tion went on, however, and in 1867 we
had 2386 businesos failures, with a loss
of over p86,000,000. Costraction con
tinued, until in 1876 we had 9092 busi
ness failures and $100,000,000 of losses.
But the money power was not satis
fled, and in 1873 congress passed a
law and struck down silver, thus mak- ,
ing gold the only money of finnl ac
count, or money of redemption, hence
enhancing the value of all coin obli
gations and disturbing business rela
tions generally. Thus we have gone
from bed to worse. seemingly, until
to-day we have, allowing the most 4
liberal estimate to be correct, of the 4
ten kinds of money, all told, but f

Poor's Manual for 1894, shows that
the railroads paid. in dividends to
stockholders and bondholders, $27,
000,000 less than in 1893.
'This loss is explained in the cor
poration reports upon the ground
that the demagogues and the law
makers have been interfering too
much with the railroad business.
It seems to us that the true expla
nation is that the railroads have
shared in the shrinkage caused by
the contraction of the currency.
Also, that the railroads, by unrea
sonable rates, have discouraged
and destroyed much of the shipping
business which should have been fos
tered; for instance, the melon and
fruit business.
Another explanation is that the
railroad presidents, vice presidents,
lawyers and lobbyists absorb such a
tremendous amount of the railroad
earnings that precious little is left for
the stockholders.-Atlanta People's

LAWYERS FOR GOLD.
WHEN MADE LEGISLATORS.,
JUDGES, OR OFFICIALS.
Are True to Their Old Master*, tile
Corporations, and Their Fees (o Right
Along- Time for Ham to Step I)own
and Out.
The Representative: The infamnles
perpetrated by the corporations are
aided by the corporation lawyer, and
the fact that he becomes a legislator,
a judge, or holds any other government
position, does not in any degree absolve
him from his allegiance to the corpora
tion. "There is," says the Chicago
Weekly Sentinel, "scarcely an instance
of misru:e or of injustice to the common
people, while conferring favors upon
the rich, that cannot be traced directly
to the machinations and intrigue of the
corporaton lawyer."
Corporations are veritable govern
ments, deriving their powers from gov
ernments formed by the people, usurp
ing the power of the civil government
and avoiding responsibility and punish
ment, no matter what the controversy,
by always having "a friend at court,"
or a paid servant, or both, in the person
of the corporation lawyer.
The government is poor, can raise"
money only by taxation; corporations
are rich, can pay their hired servants
princely sums.
Every attorney regards it as his fir.st
great duty to provide for the payment
of his fee. He will take any case, or
any side of a case, provided his fee is
forthcoming. A man may be a mighty
poor lawyer, but he is always a good
fee-taker. Nobody ever knew a lawyer
to refuse any part of a fee offered him.
Now, take a lawyer who has spent
half of his life working for the man
or oorporation that will pay him the
biggest fee, instead of studying ques
tions of right and wrong that affect the
welfare of his fellow man, and he is
mighty poor material to make a disi:n
terested, unselfish, patriotic statesman
of. Ten chances to one he will keep
right on taking fees from the most gen
erous fee-giver.
Uncle Sam pays a lawyer $5,000 a
year for his services as United States
senator. His old master, a certain rail
road corporation, in whose employ he
may yet continue secretly, can pay him
$50,000 for his vote on an important
measure, and make money by the op
eration. Can the conscience of the av
erage corporation lawyer stand such a
strain?
Uncle Sam pays his president $50,000
a year. A money syndicate, or corpora
tion of bankers, if you please, can pay
him $1,000,000 to force a big bond issue,
and make for them $10,000,000 clear by
the operation. Could a man accustomed
all hit life to taking fees from corpora
tions, and trying to make the wrong
side of questions appear right, resist
such a temptation?
A man accustomed all his life to re
gard his fee as the most important
feature of any transaction is a danger
ous man to represent the interests of
the common people, who are unable to
back up a small salary with extra fees
and perquisites.
And yet it Is just that class of men
who get into office, especially into legis
lative halls, elected by the aid of corpo
rations, to do the dirty work of corpo
rations.
You can count on your fingers the
names of every congressman and U. 8.
senator who was, prior to his election,
neither a corporation attorney nor an
omcer, director or stockholder in a na
tional bank.
Nearly every cabinet officer since the
days of Lincoln has been a corporation
lawyer. Every president since Grant
has been a corporation lawyer.
Every federal judge of the present
day, with scarcely an exception, has
been a corporation lawyer.
Shiras, who went over to the million
aires with the casting vote on the in
come tax, was a corporation lawyer.
Olney, the new secretary of state, won
his appointment through his devotion
to the interests of corporations less than
a year ago.
Harmon, the new attorney gene-al,
has long been the head of a firm of
corporation lawyers, and announces
that business in his interest will still be
transacted at the old stand.
Chauncey Depew gets $100,000 a year
as attorney for a single corporation,
and the man whom he is coachlng for
president wouldn't stand the ghost bf
a chance for renomination were it not
for his past services as attorney for
railroad corporations.
With the executive, judicial and leg
islative branches of our goverament
ander the management of eorporation
lawyers, is it any wonder that our laws
are passed, interpreted and exeeated
in the Interest of corporations, and to
the great detriment of the common peo
ple?
There is little hope for genuine po
lltileal reform until the corporation law
ye is made to step down sad out.
We publish elsewhere ba story of a
pensioner of the government lvltag in
the State of Kases who demanded his
mosey in gold The gedhags have en
couragee every lu,.n to ne.,eve that ,he
has a perfect right to demand gold for
any government obligation. Mr. Car
lisle has insisted on paying out gold on
Paper that specifically states that it
represents gold or silver, and he pays
out gold on other paper whose face
calls for silver. Mr. ('leveland and his
abettors say that it is necessary to pay
every obligation in gob. upon the de
mand of foreigners. They insist further
more that there is an abundance of gold
as a basis for all the paper and silo 'r
obligations that are now being used.
The man who believes the truth of
these statements naturally expects that
he can go to a bank and demand gold
for any money he earns. Whether this
Kansas pensioner really believed the
story he had heard that it would be a
robbery of the soldiers to remonetize
silver a:,d pay the government pen
sioners in silver dollars, or whether he
wanted to prove that those who thus
talked were liars, le tried the experi
ment and found that the "honest
money" was not on hand to pay his
lpension.
Here is a practical test of the honesty
of the "honest money" scheme. If the
pensions of the soldiers alone were to be
paid each quarter in gold two-thirds of
the banks of the country would hay" io
shut their doors and go out of busine:s.
Let the people demand the gold for
every day business purposes and the
bankers would be the most eager people
in the country for a double standard.
We doubt if there is a bank in Rich
mond that could pay its obligations for
three days with gold alon'.
There.is nothing that more clearly
demonstrates the dishonesty of these
advocates of a single standard. This
pensioner had a perfect right to de
mand payment in gold, and if he had
been dealing with honest men he would
have received his demand. These gold
I bug papers tell us that the poor mian
wants the very best money for his
services, but when he goes to a bank
and demands that he shall be paid in
gold he is driven out of the bank.
A home or foreign banker can, ho .
ever, send to the United States Treas
ury a silver certificate. which the bank
er says is worth only fifty cents on the
dollar, and get dollar for dollar in gold.
When one who knows anything of
money hears one of these goldbugs talk
about the abundance of gold for all
commercial purposes and sees with
what tenacity the banks cling to it and
knows that there is not enough in the
banks to pay the soldiers' pensions
alone the thought cannot be kept back
"what liars these goldbug mortals be."

Hard on Cleveland.
The law said that import duties
interest on the bonds should be paid in
"Coin."
The law said that import duties
should be paid in "Coin."
The scheme of the law was that the
import duties should supply the coin
needed to pay the interest on the bonds.
If this law were carried out, we
would always be lush of coin, and bond
issues could not be forced.
But Cleveland says that coin, at the
Custom House, means either silver or
gold.
Therefore the Wall Streeters pay the
import duties in silver.
At the treasury, Cleveland says the
word coin means gold.
Therefore the Wall Streeters get
gold.
In this adroit way Cleveland plays
into the hands of the Wall Streeters,
and they catch the tax payers both
ways.
Do you believe that Cleveland pros
titutes public policy to the Wall Street
syndicates in this way without.being
paid for it-either directly or in
directly ?
Never in the world. A corrupter
ruler than Cleveland has never held
the reins of our Government. His
enormous wealth, suddenly piled up,
during the last four years, cannot be
explained upon any other idea than
that he has been a secret partner in
the infamous deals he has allowed Wall
Street to make at the expense of the
people.
What will be the next move, after
the raiders have got all the bonds they
want?
The retirement of the Greenback!
The paper money of the Government
is to be destroyed, and the monopoly of
issuing currency and of controlling its
volume is to be handed over to the
national bankers. Silver will be
token money only; gold will be the
money of reserves and final payment;
bank notes will be the currency of the
business world, and the national bank
monopoly will set their own price upon
that
Take a broad view of the tendency of
I events, and see if this isn't the situation
Swhich threatens us:
Ist. The nation's public revenues
mortgaged to the Wall Street syndl
cates by means of bonds.
2ad. The nation's private revenues
put at the mercy of the Wall Street
syndicates by means e. the transporta
tion taxes leviel by the raillroads and
the taxes levied on the medium of ex

Japan sold to the United States goods
to the value of 264,417,237 yen and to
Europe only 217,745,204 yen. But in
the same time Japan purchased from

only 57,960,908 yen. The United

ance of trade in favor of Japan as
against the United States amounted

says that Japan should buy her war
ships in the United States in order to
show her friendliness to this country

Some Flee Goats.
It is reported that the sultan of
Turkey has sold to Cecil Rhodes of
South Africa, five hundred of the fa
mous Angora goats, which are raised
on the plains of Asia Minor, for 16000.
The report seems hardly credible, for
the Turks have always guarded this
special breed of goats with the most
jealous care, and their exportation is
prohibited under the severest penal
ties. Several times it is said, the
United States department of agricul
ture has attempted to secure speci
mens of the breed for introduction
into the United States. even offering
fabulous prices for them, but all in
vain. Thcse goats furnish the hair
from which is woven the high plriced
Persian bshawls and rugs.
