TARIFF MAKING.
The extra session of the United
States Congress has almost ‘been en
tirely devoted to the discussion o>f
tariff revision.
The democratic members of both
houses, as well as some of the dissat
isfied republicans have frequently
claimed that the schedule as brought
forth by the ‘‘stand-patters*' contain'
ed numerous “jokers.” The Chron
icle does not claim to have a very
complete knowledge of tariff making,
but we are almost convinced that the
whole affair is a genuine joke.
It is probably safe to say that when
the Payne-Aldrich measures have
been enacted it will represent the idea
of fewer national lawmakers than w<j
can enumerate on the fingers of our
two hands, as it appears that the law
is not to represent the ideas of con
gress or the president (if he was con
scientious when making the race for
but the ideas of the two
men whose name it bears.
Every senator and representative
evidences great interest on items in
the tariff bill that affects his own con
stituents, while no one seems to repre
sent the whole people. Those remark
able “stand-patters,” Payne and Aid
rich, have abundantly taken care of
their home districts and no doubt
their constituents are very proud of
them.
We can very readily see that the
most unfortunate part of the revision
concerning the south is that the lead
ers of the party"in power did not hail
from this section.
The question of tariff making is an
important one, and is one that very
few people know a great deal about,
only in a general way. However, it
is evident that when the present bill
becomes a law the common people will
find it just as 'hard to make a little
money go a long ways as ever.
We hope there is a day near at
hand when the tariff will be revised
and revised by those who do not sub
scribe to the protective theory.—

GAMBLING IN BREAD STUFFS.
From Ohio a strong plea has been
sent to congress for the enactment of
legislation that shall make gambling
in wheat and other food stuffs illegal.
Tn fact as constituting an illegality
punishable not by fine alone, but by
fine and imprisonment. What would
a fine of SIO,OOO be to a man who by
skillful manipulation of the grain
market “cleaned up” in one deal
SIOO,OOO. Patten’s work Tn that line
sent np the price of wheat all over
the land, and not bread alone felt the
rise, but the prepared foods whose
A Weekly Paper Edited by THOS. E. WATSON and J. D. WATSON
base is wheat, and that means so
much to children and invalid*. l)o
those grain manipulators consider
what the Patten deal means?
To those who find it hard when
prices are normal to feed and clothe
their little ones, the problem is a se
rious one. It means hungry children
and half sharved mothers fainting at
the washtub, where they are striving
to earn a pittance that shall keep life
in the little bodies ano give them
strength for another day’s toil. No
gambling in any of t'he necessities of
life should lie permitted, but of all
forms of stock gambling, that in
wheat is the most reprehensible.—■Sa

THE INEQUALITIES OF THE
TARIFF.
How the Poor Man is Taxed More for
His Clothes Than the Rich Man.
■ ■ ■ I , »‘
We have 1 been asked repeatedly io
explain the reason for the statement
so frequently made that under the
present 'tariff the poor man is taxed
for his clothes more than the rich
man. Like the tariff on other com
modities, the tariff on wool goods has
■been in process of construction since
the civil war, and it is a part of the
game to confuse the law with phrases
like “ad valorem,” “specific,”
“scoured wool,” etc., which makes
confusion-wprse confounded; and to the
average individual the wool schedule
is as clear as mud. The bewildered
consumer has long ago practically
given up the attempt to understand
it. Alli he knows is that his clothing
is getting poorer and costs more
every year. There is a reason, how
ever.
Combing wool, so called, makes the
worsteds which go into the clothing
of the well-to-do.
While all kinds of wool are appar
ently taxed the same by the Dingley
and Payne bills, as a matter of fact
the tax is much higher, in some cases
four times higher, on the clothing
wool used for the clothing of the poor
than on combing wool used for the
clothing of the well-to-do. This re
sult is brought about by placing a
duty of 1.1 cents a pound on unscour
ed wool. The manufactrer of worst
ed for clothing of the well-to-do gets
as much as 800 pounds of scoured
wool from 1,000 pounds of unscoured*
wool, while the manufacturer of card
ed woolen cloth for clothing the poor
gets as low as 200 pounds of scoured
woll from 1,000 pounds of unscoured
wool. And yet the tariff tax on the
1,000 pounds of unsecured wool is the
same, 110, in each case.
Thus the tariff on scoured wool for
Atlanta, Ga., Thursday, May 27, 1909
clothing for the poor runs as high as
55 cents a pound, while the tariff on
scoured wool- for the worsted clothes
Which ihe well-to-do wear runs as low
as 14 cents a pound. This is one of
the. tariff tricks that lor over forty
years has deprived the American peo
ple of low priced clothing and bail*
up the great worst rd firrs'L,
Senator Lodge, who, by the way,
financially able to buy worsted cloth- '
ing. ays that 'he made no promise
to help revise the tariff downward,
whif ’ is in entire tune with the sena
tor’s past record. Senator Crane,
who is also able to buy worsted cloth
ing, is not saying a word, but as far
as is known is in full accord with Mr.
Lodge in this matter.
If the Massachusetts senators did
not promise to revise the tariff down
ward, President Taft did, and he is
distinctly on record as favoring a
reduction in the tariff, which will
mean a lessening in the cost of com
'l*'< . / t.-re consumer; m,,w that
the Massachusetts senators have
abandoned the interests of the con
sumers of their state for a mess of
political pottage, the only hope of the
people is in the political honesty of
President Taft.
Is it any wonder that William Whit
man could afford to give a $5,000
present to a man who sits at the el
bow of the tariff committee when
they are making up the tariff sched
ule ? —Boston Traveller.

We’ve thought for some time that
the good we are doing* in China, Ja

where we send missionaries, was cost
ing too much. We could get better
results with less money and energy
right here at home. We’re going

foreign mission work and neglecting
f&e home mission work.
Since Tom Watson began discussing
the subject, thousands of timid people
have been encouraged to speak out on
the subject, and we hear people say
on every hand that they are tired of
wasting so much money on foreign
mission work. —Nashville Herald.
