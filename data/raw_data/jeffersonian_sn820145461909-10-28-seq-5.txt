self may revile him. The golden
hearted woman of simple trust and
high ideals never sees—blindly re
fuses to see—wrong in the man she
loves. “The Gypsy’s Warning” falls
on heedless ears. His hand alone
tears the bandage from her eyes, and
the revelation of his perfidy shatters
her heart and wrecks her life forev
er. Oh, moral element mob! It is
the sanction like this that such as
you give to the double standard, and
to the worship of money in the hands
of murderers and thieves, which
stamps our civilization as rotten to
the very core!
WOMAN’S BEST AGE IS PAST
THIRTY.
(Concluded from Page 2)
“Constantly, in studying the lives
of those who succeed, you will find
that it is the tenth, or even the four
teenth, child that makes the family
famous. Carlyle and Napoleon will
do for examples in widely divergent
fields.
“Each was so fortunate as to have
for mother a mature woman, at her
best when the child was born.”
****>!<**
Women make constantly the great
mistake of letting the years count.
Don’t let them count.
Women are as different from one
another as are cabbages from rose
bushes. If you are a rosebush, don’t
consent to be old at the age which
ends a cabbage’s career. You are
beginning to realize your possibili
ties when the cabbage type of woman
has ended her life’s usefulness.
And remember this, you need not
be a cabbage woman unless you want
to.
Keep young, keep cheerful. Keep
up your interest —not merely in what
your husband or best young man
has to say about himself, but in
every question.
Again, we say a woman’s best age
—the period where she attains her
best womanhood —is past thirty
years, but we will not say with Os
ler, “that men should be chloro
formed at sixty.” We know that
women should not, for many at that
age are mentally at their best, more
especially if they learned early in
life the lesson, which so many sadly
neglect, of keeping the years from
counting. It is every woman’s duty
to herself, husband and family, to
study how to prevent the years from
counting; it can be done; it is a
woman’s duty. Don’t let them
count. —Gaillard’s Southern Medi
cine.

Cured Hrs
Kidney and Bladder
Trouble At Home, At Small Cost. Will
Gladly Tell Any Sutterer How.
Mr. A. S. Hitchcock (Clothing Dealer), 970
Carrier Building, East Hampton, Conn., says
if any sufferer from a Kidney, Bladder or
Uric Acid Ailment will send him their address
he will, without any charge whatsoever, direct
them to the splendid and harmless remedy he
so successfully used at home in his own case.
We suggest it would be well to write him at
once, before letters get so nume ous he be
comes unable to answer them all promptly.
. The information he so freely gives has proven
of particular value to hundreds of suffering
people.
the New England manufacturer to
seize for his own use, forty bales of
cotton out of every hundred produced
at the South. And the tariff confis
cates the property of the Western
farmer as well. Os course, the rob
bery despoils everybody in the Union,
excepting the manufacturers, and
those corporations which can shift
their tariff burdens onto others. Pas
sengers and shippers repay to the
railroads the tariff which they paid.
So with national bankers, express
companies, insurance companies and
so on.
The contraction of the currency,
following the end of the War, had
more to do with the transfer of
wealth to non-producers than all oth
er causes combined. In fact, the
money kings of today are mainly re
sponsible for the plight that we are
in.
But the Socialists will not discuss
the financial question. Why? Be
cause it so thoroughly explains how
the people have been brought to
such a pass. The Socialist fears that
knock-down proposition, to wit: Our
constitutional system of money has
been changed; this change is the
cause of most of the ills we suffer
from; if we will return to the old
landmarks on that matter, and upon
similar abuses of power, we will be
a prosperous, happy people, as we
once were.
And again, the Land Trust. O my!
It seems that a New York banking
concern has bought five hundred
thousand acres in Texas, and Brother
Brand sees a land trust forming.
There are, it is true,
lators who will plunge that way,
once in a while, but those of
us who dwell in the old States
know that a land trust is an impos
sibility. No, no; the system which
high finance has fastened upon us
skims the cream off wealth produc
tion in all its fields; and the money
king does not have to bother with
the ownership, feeding and milking
of. the cow. Why should the mag
nates of special privilege have
land fever when they can so easily
rob both the landlord and the tenant,
both the field-hand and the man who
hires him?
Peter Cooper understood the game,
and so did every old Greenbacker.
The Pops did, too. They knew that
all this country needed was the undo
ing of what Congress had done for
the specially favored.
People got into debt and lost their
homes as a natural result of contrac
tion. Those seventy-five per cent,
of tenants were made so, or kept
so, by class-legislation.
The Texas land to which I alluded
is the school domain which, accord
ing to the newspapers, is an im
mense body of good agricultural
land. It was offered by the State, at
nominal prices, on long terms of in
stallment payments. This statement
has been made repeatedly and has
not been denied. I did not mean to
say that the farms were to be given
away. Even the United Slates gov
ernment does not make an absolute
gift of the public domain.
Brother Brand surmises that the
place which I bought for $4 per acre
is now worth S4O per acre. Not at
all. After it had been greatly im
proved, and after two towns, one on
either side, came to its rescue, I di
vided the tract and sold most of it
on credit, on ten year’s time, for $lO
Jeffersonian
per acre. One strip, well situated,
and quite near the thriving town of
Thomson, and on which a large new
cottage had been built, sold for sls
per acre, on ten year’s time.

WHAT THE FIRELESS COOKER
WILL DO.
By an Expert Cook.
The tireless cooker will not cook
without fire, but is called “fireless”
because once food has been started
to boiling it will retain the heat and
continue the process of cooking.
It cooks soups, meats, cereals, veg
etables, boiled puddings and many
other articles of food more perfectly
than it is possible to do on any ordi
nary coal or flame stove.
It will roast meat and bake bread,
cakes, etc., in the same length of
time as an ordinary stove. This is
made possible by the roasting attach
ment, which consists of two heavy
metal radiators. They are heated and
placed one beneath the pail and the
other on the rack above the food.
By retaining all the juices, it ren
ders cheap cuts of meats nutri
tious and palatable, insures digestion,
and on account of the many delight
ful boiled and steamed dishes to
which it is so well adapted, it has a
tendency to create an appetite for
wholesome food.
As a fuel-saver, it is an economy
which the woman in moderate cir
cumstances can not afford to ignore.
It saves the time, patience and
strength of the housekeeper, thereby
promoting the welfare of the entire
family.
It reduces the work of “washing
up” after meals to the minimum,
since there are no smoked nor
burned utensils to clean.
It enables the housekeeper to
have a clean, cool kitchen, without
the muss and confusion incident to
cooking on a hot stove.
By its use one can always have hot
water for sickness or emergencies.
Where members of a family can
not all come to their meals at the
same time it is invaluable, since food
may be kept warm without drying
out or getting overdone.

After
La Grippe
“I had suffered several weeks
with LaGrippe. Had pains in
my head and eyes. It felt as
though there was a heavy weight
on the top of my head, until it
seemed that my brain would
burst. I was so nervous that
I could not rest or sleep. When
I dozed off I would awake with
a sudden jerking of my whole
body. Dr. Miles’ Nervine, Heart
Remedy and Nerve and Liver
Pills cured me. A number of
friends have since realized the
same benefits.”
MRS. ALVIN H. LOCKS,
Seabrook, N. H.
The after effects of LaGrippe
are often more serious than the
disease, as it leaves the system
in a weakened condition that
invites more serious troubles,
such as pneumonia, etc.
Dr. Miles’
Restorative Nervine
should be taken for some time
to thoroughly restore nerve
strength.
Dr. Miles’ Nervine Is sold by all drug
gists. If the first bottle does not benefit,
your druggist will return your money.
