a Answer to "An Interesting
Letter."
Owing to an unavoidable delay
we did not receive the following
answer to lIon. Ili Ioller's letter
until too late for last week's issue,
so could not publish as p'r prom
ise.

In reply, will say that I have
severed my connection with the
G. O. P., having concluded (rather
late I admit) to pass the remainder
of my terrestrial cxistence in rcs
,ectaile ipoliticled company, and no
onger amalga;mate with, or endorse
the actions of ia party, or rather
ring, , ho will appropriate any
thing to their own use and advan
taes in politics, from a "nig(.rr's
dog to a woman's relputatinn" ir
resp'etive of the law of "ICeumn et
tucomI."
Who have abrogate:! the consti
tution of the United States in re
fusing to allow the nezroes to vote
in this parish, even though tax
payers and registered voters, there
by making themselves amenable to
the Federal laws for a direct and
flagrant violation of the xv Amend
ment of said Constitution.
And who, by the power given
them by their position as exponents
of the law, having charge of the
election machinery, have by abso
lute force, counted in and are at
tempting to seat only such men,
as officers, as they see fit, in face of
the most glaring and shameless
political debauchey ever witnessed
by a free American people.
This is anarchy, (vide : Web
ster's I)ictionary) pure and simple,
and will force the lawabiding citi
zens to protect themselves by ex
emplifying the axiom which in
forms us that "self preservation is
the first law of nature," and thus
bring on a state of affaits that all
honest and peace loving citizens,
look forward to with dismay and
horror.
The present State and parish ad
ministration is in every way more
corrupt, and more tyranical than
was the Kollogg administration,
and the conditions are to a certain
extent similar, the only difference
being that the White Supremacists,
1. e. The Ring, are in the same
place which the "Rads" occupied
at the time of their overthrow,
while the white citizens are demand
ing their abdication in tones not to
be imitakea.
Already the usurpers have be
ga their work ad oppression, the
juries of the present court are
obhoes from the ranks of the "cor
ruptiaois" and only such as are
konoa to be uncompromising and
bitter partisne, are allowed to act
s Grand Jrors, and no stone is
left unturned to bring indictments
uaPinst those who at the polls and
tht tfeir pen are endeavorl3ag to
prify the political situation and
Son the light," and who con
tend that a "p~'i ofioe is a pub
Ic trust," ad not ra private "asp."
Frde the foregoing, you will at

at present, are averse to their

where else) it being "stony

forcibly driven into it t save the

You will notice th it we have a

I have "perskivered" that you

still extant) who are denouncing

having pullicly expressed theii

Oily one otheer of this ward

anarchy or lawlessness) and report

an oath (iron-clad) to support, not
only the cnstitution and laws of
the State of Louisiana, but also
the dlark deeds of the RING.
Poor old fellow ! it is said that
the District Attorney had him
"(lead to rights" so he was "be
tween the Devil and the deep sea"
and could not do otherwise than
swallow the bitter plll with as good
grace as possible.
It seems that the Ring does not
hesitate to use its power to prosti
tute even the petty offices of the
parish.. (Anarchy vide Webster's
Dictionary.)
The information upon which the
preceeding statement is based,
comes from Democratic sources.
You know their record, so take it
for what it is worth.
I will conclude by saying that

DIED:
At 1:15 a. mi., Sunday, June 7th,
1i'96, in the town of Natchitoches,
Mrs. Elizabeth Luehini, (born No
Ible) wife of Ferdinand Luchini;
aged 33 years, 11 months.
D)eceased left surviving her, her
huslband and four children-one
daughtir and three sons-the eldest
daughter is 9 years and 11 months
of age, and the youngest fourteen
months.
Deceased was the daughter of
John and Eliza Nobles, both of
whom precceded her in death.
Died, Saturday, .June a;, 196,
at 4 o'clock p. m.. Katie McI)aniel.
beloved wife of Buford Roubieu
aged 2" years and 3 days.
Tiuis sad intelligeonce reacheo us
only a few hours after dear Katie
had succombed to the hand of the
I) ath Angel-bringing deepest
sorrow to the hearts of her many
friends and loving relatives.
Katie was raised in Natchitoches
-most of her life was spent among
us, finding her way into the hearts
of all who knew her, with her
bright smile and sweet winning
ways.
A few years since she bade us
good-!by and went with her mother
and sisters to make their home in
C:am pte. Now she has said Adieu
to all of her loved ones there and
crossed over the silent river to re
turn no more.
Her illness was sudden, and so
fatal tnat love and science were
powerless to save, yet her own
cheerfulness kept alive the hope
of the devoted ones around her,
even to the last despairing moment,
when with the patience and cour
age of a martyr she bade them a
last farewell, and only the
memory of her sweet resignation
remains as a consolation, while
their darling is at rest from her
sufferings, sleeping so quietly in
the little churchyard at Campti.
Oh ! sorrowing hearts, time alone
can soften thy blow. She has gone
from you now-passed over to that
Shadow Land from whence there
is no returning-but remember,
'tis not forever, she is waiting for
you there. God does not part us
eternally, and the bitter anguish of
her lost will pass away in the joy
of your reunion in Heaven.

Oeein' your adlvertisement and be

try your medicine. My wife was ales
a great sufferer from heart failure and

las been for twenty yeari. My wife's
diol.sy all gone, kidney trouble very
much better, heart trouble almost gone,.
asthlma bltter. Taking everything
into considcration-her age, which is
97, and the length of time she has been
afiilicted-it is surprising to note the
benefit she has received from the use
