L The Boy with a Boil.
lie had felt an irritation aroud
there for two or three days. Some of
tJhe boys said that it might be a wood
tick, and others asked him to lift the
curtain of the past, .I1141 see if he
couldn't remember of sitting down on
a nail.
lie was a little worried for fear lie
was to be attacked with cerebro spi
. nal meningitis or a paralytie stroke,
but Eniory PIathtinlder, the boy of the
corner groesry, sconted the idea.
' "NXo, sir," he remarked, as heo dus
ted out from hehind the helrring-box,
''it's m111 opitllyutl that yer goin' to
have a lile."
And he added that if he only hItd
time he could sit down and tell Jack
is son a hunidred stories i:nout bliles
is, bils which hail alicted kings, quelens,
empterors, Congressnmen, aldermeni,
actors, and policelen--lug biles aund
hsmall.
'The next morning Jackson got out
of bed feeling that lie had a boil.
'lhere was no longer any diubt about
I He nndertook to sit on the edge of
the bed, and draw his pants on, but
he didn't sit there miorei than a se
cond. lie got up and kicked over a.
chair, and said that a woman as old
as hi.s motlher ought to know more
thanl to stick pins in his bed.
= In bending over to pnll on his hoot
he struck against the corner of the
washstand, and lie made a clear
jumop of six feet seven inches, and
.turned around to see who struck hlirl.
Ile finally walked very carefully I
down-stairs, sat down on the edge of
the sofa until breakfast was ready,
amln then got a pillow to lint on his
elhair. lis stern old father elevated i
his eyebrows a vard or so, laid down
his knife, and says le :
"Jackson Delaney, what in thun
der do yo manlll 1"
Jackson slid the pillow back, and
sat down on his hip, and tried to
smile. His father had told him
months befoie that walnuts were pro
ductive of boils, and he had been
stealing walnuts from the garret all
Summer. Prudence and discretion,
theretie, warned him to say nothingr
about that boil.
"Jackson Delancy, why in the
mname of General Zachariah T'aylort
don't yon sit up straight in your chair,
and cat your breakfast ?" roerd the
SPuritan father, a1s he saw his son's I
i position, and Jackson sat over on the
other hmip, and began telling about a
cave in a sewer in order to occupy
_the old man's mind with other and
nobler thoughts.
When breakfast was over lie wand
ered out. He did't feel like sporting
around, and lie lay. down unlder anI
apple-tree, and tried to calculate
whether it was seven days, seven
weeks, or seven mouths before boils
came to a head.
lIe was reposing therme when the
wind shook down an apple. It ought c
to have hit him on the headi, if at all, I
but it didn't.;.it struck that. boil. 1
Jackson uttered a yell, and leaped
up, and as lie tenderly rubbed that I
boil he said ' he'd be shot to death a
with peach-stones if he didn't put a I
pound of powder under that tree be- ¬
fore lie slept. 1
Then lie heard the fire-bell ring, I
and thedusted down to box sixteen, t
tforgetting atll about his boil until a
fireman shoved 'him against a tree- t
g box., He didn't care then whether the I
house burned up or not.- .
He went over and leaned against a il
Sstore, but they threw water on him, 1
and he wended his, melancholy way ii
to his father's house, crept up stairs, f
sat down on his leg, and went to s
reading a dime novel. " .. *, a
He wondered if Big Foot Wallace, i
or Buffalo Bill1 or Captain Jack ever ft
had boils, aundit made him shudder r
to think of cravwling into a cave to ii
escape the Indians,. and hitting his l1
boil on ajagge4 rock as he went in,
When supper was ready, he stood a
before his father, and told him that o
all other boys of his age stood up to I
eat. and he'd~ like to try it for a week, e
and see how it seemed. a
"Stand up to eat !" thundered the tj
old man, as.he looked wildly around ii
for a .earlon; "sid down, sir, or I'11 'I

Hufnagle, the selowman of whose o0
elephant I told you the other day,
had an ostrich which he traded for a
mule,-to a lllnn named Leech, who tl
I owns a little place near New Hope. al
Leecl.read somnewhtere that ostriches oI
are very valuable on account of their 1
feathers, and he intended to try the P
experinient of cultivating them, so 01
lie secured this one to begin with. g
He turned it loose in the yard, and gI
that night it ate all the surface gray
el off the walks, alnd it was busy
breakfasting on the garden hoe when
Leech came down to look after it,
He fed it heartily, so as to keep down *
its appetite,. but that morning it; swal
lowed four horse-shoes that were ly- a
ing in a cart, and it disposed of six V
feet of a trace-chain belonging to the t
subsoil.plow. Leech 'ase somewhat
alarmned, but lie gave the bird as
much supper as it would eat, and
felt satisfied its hunger would not
rage durnlog the nighlt. Next morn
ing, however, he'was surprised to M
find that the ostrich had eaten a hole
tlhroughl the wall of the smoke-house,
and had chewed off all the door-knobs
on that ide of' the dwelling. Whenb
Leech came out thebird had swallow- f
ed the poump-handle and was making aj
an earnest. but ineffectual efflrt to ii
take in the pump. Leech dislsuaded fo
it, however, and led it solemnly away.
That day it ate nothing of'i a revolu
tionary chairacter but a set of Mrs. rn
Leech's old hoops, and when Leech cc
ascertained this, hie collected all the t
second-hand hoop skirts that the n
neighbors had to spare and fed them de
to thle ostrich. It cleaned up the pile
in les that~ an hour and,then it ate
six of anny Leech's croquet balls as
wihih were lying in the grass, anid D
swallowed the baby's toy drum. That to
afternoon it piotruded its h ead w
throughl the kitchen window while in
the girl was washing the dinner dish
es, And suddenly swallowed three
tumbleie, a gravy dish and a broken
butter crock. When Leech camet
homesthat night and heard the news, n
lie decided to shoot the bird the first b3
thing in the mornitng. He loaded his ie
gun for the purpose and put it in the -
shed outside the kitchen door. Du
ring ithenightan xplosion was heard,
ani when Leech descended with a
lantern to ascertain the cause, he th
peteeived the. ostrich lying dead in t
the shed. It had swallowed the gun, ei
muzzssle 'foremost, and had fired tihe
weapibn while gnawing' at the trigger.
Mr. Leech has given up thie idea of
cultivatirqg the ostrich. That bird is b
too eminseitly digestive for him. ot
