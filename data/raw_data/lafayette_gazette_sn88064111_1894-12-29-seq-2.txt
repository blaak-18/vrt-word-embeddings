tion. It will,.be held at Shreve
:y.rt, on Tuesday, Jan. 15, and
promises to be productive of good
results. Farmers from Eastern Tex
'as, Southern Arkansas , and Louis
iana are earnestly urged to be pres
lent as subjects'of vital importance to
them will beFdiscussed. The call
very properly sets forth the urgent
necessity of immediate action on
the part of cotton planets. The
question of cheep cotton, reduced
transportation, cotton seed, diver
sified farming and kindred topics
will be disceased by men of exper
ience and talent and it is to be
hoped that all interested in the cul
ture of the fleecy staple will take a
live interest in the convention.
Every parish where cotton is one
of the chief products should send
delegates in the hope that some
plan will be adopted to bring relief
to the agriculture districts. Con
ventions of this kind have been
held, notably the one at Natchez
some weeks ago, and they have been
the means of eliciting much intelli
gent discussion on the causes re
sponsible for the actual low prices
of cotton. It is only by bringing
together the wisest and best in
formed men of the country that
some satisfactory conclusion may
be-arrived at. There is no doubt
that the present prices cannot con
tinue without total ruin to all cotton
farmers and unless remedial meas
ires are employed, the whole coun
try dependent upon the cotton crop
'will suffer serious if not irreparable
Injury.
RAILROAD ACCIDENTS.
Railroad accidents have occurred
with alarming frequency of late.
In some instances lives of railroad
men have been lost while serious
bodily injuries were sustained by
others Accidents will happen to
trains do matter how careful and
diligent the officials and employes
of the roads may be, but since a
few weeks so many wrecks and col
lisions are reported that an inquiry i
as to their cause would not be a:miss.
Are they attributable to carclcssnress
on the part of the employes? We
are unable to say, but If the fault
lies with them, the proper authori
ries should investigate matters at
once, and if possible prevent the re
currence of these death-dealing ac
cidents in the future.
Some well-informed persons are
of the opinion that these unusual
accidents are due to the large num
ber of trains that are being run
since the busy season has opened,
while other genltemen equally well
informed, believe that carelessness
_and neghligence, are in most cases,
resnponsible for them. Thi:s road
has always enjoyed the reputation
of being one of the safest in the
co: atry, and it is or ly lately that ac
cidents on it have been unreason
ably frequent.
The Gazette earnestly hopes that
th.e officials will take the proper
":scps toward checking these fear
ful catastrophes. That something
should be done at once, it is clearly
eident. Men, in most cases fath
ers of families, have lost their lives
while in the performance of their l
duties, and for the sake of humanity
remedial steps should immeFiately
be taken to stop this slaughter of
auman beings. It will do no good

and mourn over their deaths, but

how fitr these drifts are impeded by

phase of transition is little more
than the effect of a temporarily un
manageable superabundance of pro
ducts. It has come as the first con
sequence of a-stupendous and sudden
evolution of industrial production.
There can be no possible question
that such an evolution imparts the
hightest ultimate good to every
class of men in every interest of
life. Two methods of adjusting
this over-supply seem to offer: one
is finding new sources of consump
tion; the other in abating the exist

and sacrifice mayj be necessary -be

ed, but the final result promises

TUE SOUTHERN COTTON
A'ILLS CROWDING OUT THE
NE IV ENGLAND MfILLS.
New Orleans Picayune.
The dry goods men of New York
are making a great hue and cry
over the fact that the railroad com
panies have raised the commoner
qalities of cotton goods from
third to second-class and have in
creased the freight rates in accor
dance with the new classification.
The dry goods jobbers of the Me
tropolis claim that as the South now
manufactures the medium and com
mon classes of cotton goods more
cheaply than the Eastern mills, the:
latter are only enabled to comrn e e
through the discrimination in freight,
charges in favor of the Eastern
points as against the Southern.
The New York Journal of Com
merce and Commercial Bulletin
puts this very plainly in a recent
article. That journal says:
It should require no argument to
convince the railway companies
that they are as deeply interested as
the manufacturers and jobbers of
dry goods in maintaining the pre
eminence of New York as a disttib
uting center. It appears to the dry
goods trade that in their new classi
fication of cottons the railway man
agers have overlooked this fact.
Reducing the finest cottons from
first to second class has little or no
effect upon the distributing business
at this point, because those articles I
must be obtained from New York
and points east of it. But advanc-j
ing nearly all the cheaper and heav
ier cottons from third class to sec
ond class is likely to affect the East
ern manufacturers and jobbers se
riously, for it is in these lines that
the South is developing a large man
ufacturing business. To advance
the classification of cottons of these
grades between New York and Chi- i
cago is to turn the scale just so
much against the mills and jobbers
of the East and in favor of South
ern production. The railroad man
agers reply that even after they
have advanced the classification of
cottons to the second class the rates
from this city to the West will be
below those from Southern points.
This may be true, but it is evident
that the dry goods trade is not con
vinced of it, and even if it were 1
true the advance of 30 per cent in I1
freight charges on the commoner
classes of cottons, unbleached sheet
ing excepted, would make a marked
difference in the terms on which the
East and South enter the Western
markets. Railroads from this point
can do themselves no good by driv
ing any trade toward tile South.
This is an important acknowl
edgement on the part of an influen
tial New York publication of the
rapidly growing importance of the
South as a center of cotton manu
facturing. The New England miil
owners fully realize this fact, and
some of them have already taken
steps to estaolish branch plants in
the South for the manufacture of
the medium and commoner kinds of:
cotton goods. Ihey perceive not
only that they will be enabled to
compete better for domestic trade
from plants in the South, but that
they will also be better able to re
tain their foreign trade, which is
necessarily worked on much closer
margins than the domestic trade.
That the South, which produces
the raw material, is also the logical
center of cotton manufacturing is
now being generally recognized,
hence the growth of cotton mills in
the South will keep on steadily un
til the section becomes the greatest
center of cotton manufacture in the
world.

Yet our charities, our hospitals and

On this fair Christmas Eve, the

In every asylum, in every hospi

that glorifies our city, we seem to
see the fobt-print of the Master.
We never contemplate a splendid
church but we feel that there is so
Tmuch taken, in defiance of the
i teachings of Him to whom its empty
glories have been reared, from
charity. It really seems to us that
these splendid churches, these gor

God. WVhiat! shall we stint the
poor and the suffering to build gor
