poison or other means, and vital or

KiliooH, Remittent, and In
termittent Fevers, which uro so
prevalent in tho valleys of our great
irivorB throughout tlio United States,
especially thoso <if tho MisftisWppl,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, Afltansaa, Red, Colo

Alabama,. Mobile, Savannah, Ro

with their vast, tributaries, through
out our entire ,country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, aro invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of tho stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In thoir
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous orgaus, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the pnrposo
equal to D r . J. W amckk's V ise«ah
B ittkrs, as they will Kiiecdily remove
tho dark -colored viscid matter wit^ which
tho bowels aro loaded, nt tho saino timo
stimulating tho secretions of tho livor,
and generally restoring tho healthy func

Fortify the body agamst dis

and a hundred other painful symptoms,
aro the oikpringsot' Dyspepsia. One bot

Indolent Inflammations, Mercurial affec
tions, Old Sores, Eruptions of the Skin,
Soro Eyes, etc. In these, as in all other
constitutional Diseases, W alker's V in

ativo powers in tho most obstinate and
intractable cases.
For Inflammatory and Chronic
Rheumatism, Gout, Bilious, Remit

of tho Blood, Liver, Kidneys and Bladder,
thoso Bitters havo no equal. Suoh Dis

dug up and carried out of tho system in a
short timo by tho uso of thoso Bitters.
vFin, Tape, and other Worms,
lurking in tho system of so many thou
sands, aro effectually destroyed and re

ForFemaioCompIaiiits, in young
or old, married or single, at tho dawn of
womanhood, ortho turn of life, theso Ton
ic Bitters display so decided an influence
that improvement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
whenever you find its impnrities bursting
through tho skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores ; cleanse it when you find it ob
structed and sluggish in tho veins; cleanse
it when it is foul ; your feelings will tell
pou when. Keep tlie blood pure,
lealth of tho system will follow.
