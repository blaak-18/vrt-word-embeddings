hope tiu- r port, of the young ofScer who com
manded it, will shwvr that it was not yielded
while it was at all tenable. Its loss throws
the city back upon its inner defences, and
causes the abandonment ol the rc?sonahle hope
that if it bad been held, the fleet would bave
been forced to iua to sea again by the guns of

Tin Siar.dard has all along coatepdad that
the war can ri.ly be bropght to a close by bs
i:ctiatLn. Of cor?e a preposition for le
ceastruction would be among tho first
submitted ey. the North. It would necessa
rily have to be cisenpsed, fer ar.ei agaimt,
and it would as assuredly be reje'ed by the
South. The Standard knows this, but it
j hopes to bide its former departure from loy
alty by falsely charging; the enormity upea
otuers.
It will not avail. The peeple of North
Carolina thoroagkly understand the Standard
and its editor, and bare expressed their appre
ciation of them in a raanaer he caenot' misun
derstand. The comrruCtcation signed 44 Nutbusb "has
not the writer's name accompanying it, and.
is excluded under oar uniform rale.
