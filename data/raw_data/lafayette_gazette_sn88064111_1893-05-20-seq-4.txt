PROQRESSIVE FARMERS.
They will spend 7.e009 for hprwewsalg
Township Reads.
Abingtofi township. Montgomery
county, Pa., at the eleetion, held N'eb
roary 81, 1898, decided to borrow $79.
000 at a rate of interest not exceeding
five per cent., all of which is to be
spent for the permanent improvement
of the highways of that district.
The fight wasvery hot, the. progree
aslve citizens having organized a Road
Improvement league which did a good
deal of missionary work in convincing
the electors of the value that would
result to their farms from good roads.
The opponents comprise mostly the
old-line farmers who thought the roads

smflxo of 1893.
of their fathers were good enough for
them. Quite a considerable influence
in favor of the improvement was ex
erted by the two supervisors. Daniel
Webster,whose addres is Abington, and
Joshua Longstreth, whose post office
is Fox Chase, Philadelphia. These
supervisors are progressive and enter
prising. and may be relied upon to ju
diciously expend the fund about to be
placed at their disposal.
Abington is one of the townships of.
Montgomery county which border up
on Philadelphia. and contains the
country seats of many Philadelphians.
The supervisors have it in their power
to make the new road system a mon
ument to themselves, and it is sug
gested that a little money might
be very judiciously expended in a pre
liminary examination of approved
specimens of good roads in other parts
of Pennsylvania or neighboring states
and in the employment of a competent
engineer to lay out a regular system
before the laborof improvement actual
ly begins.
CRUELTY TO COWS.
They Need Exercise in Winter as Well as
in Summer.
Are men to allow greed to so dom
inate them as to obliterate thought of
the comfort and the health of the
brutes under their charge? Men may
regard cattle as mere machines, but
the fact remains that they are of a sen
sitive organization, capable of suffer
ing and enjoyment, and that to a de
gree too often lost sight of. The idea
that it is just as well for a cow,
either in point of comfort or health, to
be tied up six months with no exercise,
is contrary to all physiological teach
ing, that nutritious food, light and ex
ercise are necessary to the maintenance
of health and a full development. Give
cows chance to go out in the sunlight
of the warm days in winter and see
how quickly they go, and see the real
enjoyment depicted on their expressive
faces. Even though the milktlow may
be somewhat lessened, will not what
is lost in quantity be made up in
quality? At any rate, I am sure 1
would much rather eat dairy products
of strong, healthy cows than that of
those weakened and enervated by
close confinement and unnatural food,
such as would be an exclusive dict of
cornmeal. It is not necessary, in order
to give them a little exercise and sun
light, to range over an extensive area;
let them out in an ordinary-sized yard
and they will not do traveling suffi
cient to waste any great amount of
energy.-Farm, Stock and Home.
DAIRYING FOR PROFIT.
Ihow to Get at the Beal Source of Income
in the Industry.
Dairying for glory has never been a
popular pastime, and it is not likely to
be engaged in to any great extent.
Hope of profit is the alluring influence
in this, as iu arly other productive in
dustry. The objective point of every
dairyman should be to produce the
most possible of the best possible arti
cle, at the least practicable cost., to be
sold at the highest obtainable prices.
There is nd poetry in this view of the
business, but there is a vast deal of
common sense in it. This being the
end in view, that dairyman who pays
no attention to the productive capacity
of his stock, whose cows are bought
with an eye to what they cost and with
no reference to what they can do, who
ignores the whole subject of what and
how much he markets, who shuts his
eyes to all sorts of information re
specting his business-whose manage
ment, in short, is slipshod and in evoiy
essential uncertain-fails to get at the
real source of profit in his industry.
Every point needs to be carefully stud
led, everything which can be made to
contribute to success utilized. It is
better to abandon the business than
conduct it on any other plan.-1-'armers'
Voice. .
The Management of Unives.
The young calves will be very thank
ful for a small allowance of mixed
meal and bran, given once a day. If
this is given by hand, in a dish, it will
tame the young things and make thnem
so docile that there will be no trouble
when the calves grow up to cow's es
tate, and must be milked and handled.
A heifer coining in should never need
to be broken. This training, not
breaking, should be done early and in
the winter when the opportunities are
plenty, and if well done there will be
no bad habits to be broken. The care
should be tolead the young animal by
degrees from one stage to another to
perfect famiiiarity with its keeper.
There will be no vicious or refractory
cows in a dairy managed in this way.

success in Tomato Culture.
Important in tomato culture is it
that the plants be kept growing vigor
ously, a condition involving rich soil
and frequent tillage. Frequent trans
planting makes stocky plants. Other
things being equal, the earliness and
productiveness of tomatoes are in di
rect proportion to the earliness of set
ting in the field Trimming the plants
after a part of the fruit had set in
creased the yield by more than one
third. Among the best varieties for

Gov. Chase, of Indians, in his recent
message to the legislature of that state. G
strikes the key-note of the roads quea. a
tion in the following language: r!
"It is gratifyingto notice the interest v
now being taken in the discussion as to f
whether Indiana shall become a lead- t1
ing state in the betterment of publio
roads. The press almost unanimonsly ii
is advocating a better law. The late h
convention held in this city for the par- 1
pose of making recommendations to the e
legislature was one of the most intel- t
ligent ever convened here. No law con- t
templated by this hoserable body cant
compare with one that shall give the "
farmer an open market all the year a
round so far as material prosperity is I
concerned. t
"'Let there be no mistake as to the r
make-up of the committee who shall 0
have so much responsibility placed r
upon it as this one, as le who supports e
legislation with this object in view can n
subserve the best interests of his con- t
stituents in no other way so thorough- i
ly. I doubt if further taxation is nec* t
essary for the redemption of our high- u
ways. The revenue now used is enor- c
mous when we consider the results ob- v
tained. The trouble is our system is d
wrong. We need more brains and less t
muscle in the cause, and until this is v
brought about we shall remain in the t
slough of despondency. There is no L
comparison between our roads and t
those of foreign countries, nor of a
those in our many sister states. We E
are woefully behind them in all thrs t
matter. The railroads that eross our '
state like a network have greatly en- r
hanced the value of property, but with a
first-class public highways the increase
in our material wealth will be difficulnt T
to estimate. The farmer will be the
greatest beneficiary In this matter
and yet good roads concern di
rectly every citizen. For several
E months in each year the farmer is un
able to do anything because of impass
able roads. His teams are idle, and a
the profits of the months be has toiled
are used up in doing nothing. This
condition of business economy must be
changed, and no matter will require
your thoughtful attention more than t
legislation for the betterment of our -
highways." 3
The one phrase in the governor's
message that has a world of meaning is
"We need more brains and less mus
cle." t
THE PEACH ORCHARD. t
I
It Must Have Every Advantage to Senure
a Good Crop.
In planting peach trees care should i
be taken to give the orchard every ad-t
vantage to secure a crop and to make
the fruit of the best quality and ap
pearance, for the reach is a paying
c op when it hits the market just 3
right. The best situation is an ele- r
vated one, as there is less danger of
frost. The best soil is one of a warm, 3
quick nature; it should be naturally n
ri ;:h or made so by manure. The peachl
tree requires richer soil than the apple,
I think; a soil with a large share of
potash in it is one of the best. I no
tice orchards on hillsides do best, even
though the soil may not be so good. t
The land should slope to the north
rather than south, the blrow of the hill
being a better location than a steep
northern or southern slope. When on a
southern exposure a few warm days
may bring out the fruit buds, and they b
be killed by a cold snap. I have ob
served that orchards on high northern I
slopes seldom fail. Some may claim
to have a richer fruit from southern
aspects, tut the orchards on the north
do not fail to have fruit of good quality
also.
The culture of the peach is quite
simple, but it must be thorough and
constant; neither grass nor grains
should be allowed to grow among
them. Garden crops, 1 find, may be I
I grown in the orchard even with a ben-2
efit, as they are heavily manured and
well worked. The finest peach orchard
and the finest fruit I ever saw was
planted on a rich, warm soil, culti
vated and manured every year the
same as the corn crop, and kept well '
pruned. In selecting trees, I much
L prefer a small tree to a large one. I
have known some growers to select
the largest, thinking thereby to get 1
fruit earlier; but I believe such per

GOOD COW STALLS.
f A IAlht for Dairyme froem Prince Ed
wardI Island,.
s The best thing I have yet seen in the
way of floors and gutter-s is something
-on the principle of "Stewart's stall
a grating." The gdtter as here pictured
is 12 inches wide and 12 inches deep,
i and is sunk so that the top is on a level
with the floor; and the back plank of
the gnitter has a slope of 6 inches, the
top of which is beveled to the plank on
whIch the cows stand. Over the edge
of the gutter is a wooden grating of
hard-wood ribs 2 by 1)( inches, 14
- inches in width, so placed that the
- cow's hind feet rest upon it.
SWith this floor your cows are always
t dry, no manure on their legs or skin;
a in fact, it has all the advantagesof
a Stewart's grating, with the exception
o that instead of standing on cold steel
a the cows stand on wood. The manure,
y however, is taken out daily, and this
o is an advantage if it is desired, as it
should be, to keep the stable clean and
r sweet.--Country Gentleman.

"The people out in Fresno eounty,
Caliafornia are getting ready fi their
annual round-up and slaughter of jack
rabbits,". said P athan Levy, a leading
vineyardist of Freano. "If it wasn't
for this early spring systematic raid on
those destructive pests we would have
hearcely a vineyard or an orchard left
in southern California On one day in
March, generally between the 10th and
15th. the grape and small fruit growers
collect together in their respective dis
tricts and beat the country thoroughly
to drive the swarming jack rabbits
from their hiding places into immense
wire enclosed corrals, where they are
at the mercy of their pursuers, and are
knocked in the head with clubs by the
thousand. I have known 15,000 jack
rabbits to be slaughtered in this way
in a few honras. More than that these
rabbits are such prolific breeders that
every one killed in March or April
means that there will be twenty-five or
thirty less than there would have been
if the rabbits knocked is the head in
the spring .had been permitted to live
until falL These round-ups are the
only means we have ever discovered by
which the jack rabbit pest has been kept
down. The rabbits are unduly fond of
the young shoots of the grapevines,
when they make their appearance in
the spring, and of the tender bark of
prune, plum and other fruit trees, when
the sap starts. I have known twenty
acres of vineyard ruined in a single
night by the cropping of the shoots by
these animals, and whole orchards of
valuable bearing trees killed by the
rabbits girdling them. Poison, traps
and guns failed to kill off the rabbits
fast enough, and fruit growing in that
part of California would necessarily
have been to a great extent abandoned
if a Fresno county genius hadn't evolved
the corralling idea five years ago. The
rabbits are driven into the great wire
inclosed pound by hundreds of people
-men, women and children-closing in
around them and preventing them from
going in any other direction, except the
one that leads them into the corral.
Different districts have different days
for setting out on the round-up, and
the slaughter goes on through March
and April. It is safe to say that 100,000
jack rabbits are thus killed every spring
in that part of the state. As at that
season of the year this big rabbit's
flesh is in in excellent condition and
the animal is highly esteemed as
food, a twofold benefit is derived from
this great yearly slaughter. The Cali
fornia jack rabbit is the biggest rabbit
in existence, one five feet long being
not uncommon. They are as fleet as
the wind, but will sit still on their
forms or by the roadside until you have
almost grabbed them by their mule
like ears, but before you have closed
your fingers on them there will be no
rabbit there, but if you look thirty or
forty yards ahead you will see. what
you think is another one humped up in
a fluffy bunch, waiting for you in the
same way. But it won't be another
rabbit. It will be the same one. They
,are as swift and sudden as the fleas that
swarm on them as soon as the summer
comes. These fleas are so thick upon
the jack rabbit, and are so ravenous,
that they have actually reduced the
long-eared, four-footed jumper to a
skeleton by the time the fall rains set
in. If it wasn't for those regular fall
rains the fleas would be of great service
to us in destroying the rabbit pest, for
the rabbits could not stand out many
days longer against the assaults of the
lively parasites. BIt the fall rains are
fatal to the fleas. The water kills them
and washes them off of the rabbits and
the latter pitch in on our vineyards and
orchards and grain with sharpened ap

The Argument Used
Y the makers of the second-class biaking
powders to induce the dealer to push
them off on Royal consumers is that
they cost less than Royal and afford
the dealer much' more profit.
But you, madam, are charged the same price
for them as for the absolutely pure Roy-al, which
is perfectly combined from the most highly refined
and expensive materials. The lower cost of the
others is caused by the cheap, impure materials
used in them, and the haphazard way in which
they are thrown together.
