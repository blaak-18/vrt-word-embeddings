LETTERS HIT LANESBORO EDITOR
O’Ryan Criticised by Reed
Some Statements of Attorney for Vet
erans Bureau Committee
Repudiated.
Mystery as to How Unauthorized
Report Was Given Out to
Newspapers.
—K-K-K—
---WASHINGTON, D. C.—Senator
David A. Reed, of Pennsylvania,
chairman of the special committee
which has been investigating the
veterans’ bureau, practically repudi
ated parts of the report of General
O’Ryan, the committee’s counsel. He
says no member of the committee
knew just how publicity was given
the report and that it was premature
and in many parts altogether wrong.
He declared before the Senate Tues
day that what was printed was taken
from first proofs which have been
substantially changed.
Senator Reed and his colleagues
on the committee deplore what they
characterized as a premature publi
cation. The committee’s report will
not be ready to lay before the Senate
for ten days and in the meantime the
Pennsylvania senator asked other
members of the Senate to withhold
judgement on what was put out by
the committee’s counsel. There is a
disagreement with General O’Ryan
and the committee indicates that it
will approve only part of findings as
butlined by him. It is character
ized as unauthorized and deplorable.
In making his statement to the Sen
ate, Senator Reed said:
Without Knowledge of Committee
“I desire to make a very brief
statement in regard to the publica
tion in the newspapers of what ap
pears to be the report of counsel to
the select committee which is exam
ining into the veterans’ bureau.
“The extracts from that so-called
report were printed without the
knowledge or consent of the com
mittee of the Senate which is making
the investigation. What was printed
appears to be extracts from the first
proof received from the printer of
General O’Ryan’s report and that has
been very extensively changed in
subsequent proofs.
Statement Not Authorized
“General O’Ryan has not taken up
the report with the committee, has
not submitted his report to the com
mittee, has not yet consulted most
of the committee about it, and what
appeared in the newspapers is not in
any sense an approval or authorized
final statement from the committee
or from its counsel.
“I ask the Senate to pay no atten
tion to the newspaper extracts that
have appeared. We hope to have our
final report, including that part of
counsel’s report with which we
agree, Teady for the Senate within
ten days. There are a great many
recommendations made by General
O’Ryan with which we are in entire
agreement, and there are some with
which we do not agree. I ask the sen
ate to reserve judgment on this sub
ject until we can get in our report in
final form.”
ALIENS CONVICTED
OF ATTACKING GIRLS
Alliance, Ohio. Accused by two
young girls, who declared the men
kept them prisoners all night in a
garage, two aliens are serving sen
tences of 90 and 60 days each in the
Stark county workhouse.
They are Bernard Koroyski, who
was fined S2OO and costs, and sen
tenced to 90 days, and Andy Bur
netti, whose fine was fixed at $l5O
and costs and 60 days’ imprisonment.
The trial was before Judge E. W.
Diehl of Alliance.
The girls testified they were lured
into an automobile by Koroyski and
Burnetti in Sebring and were taken
to the garage and locked in.
Neither of the girls is 16 years old.
When the girls failed to return
home, a search was started for them
which finally led to the discovery
that they were captives. There were
threats of mob violence when the
identity of the men became known,
but the parents of the victims asked
that the law be permitted, to take
its course.

ESGH-GUMMINS ACT
MEETS OPPOSITION
New Chairman of Interstate Com
merce Commission Favors
Changes
-K-K-K '
(Bureau Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C.—Now that
Senator Cummins has been defeated
for chairman of the Interstate Com
merce committee of the Senate, pro
gressive senators will begin action to
bring a reduction of freight rates in
this country. The new chairman,
Senator Smith, Democrat, is in favor
of amendments to the Esch-Cummins
act to bring about a reduction and
will have the active support of seven
progressive and insurgent senaltors
and the minority to help him.
Senator LaFollette, of Wisconsin,
leader of the insurgents in the Sen
ate has made the first move in the
new Congress toward achieving his
object along this line. He has of
fered drastic amendments to the
Esch-Cummins law, in support of
which he is said to expect the aid of
all progressives and radicals in both
parties. He contends that if the
amendments can be enacted into law
the country will be saved hundreds
of millions of dollars in freight
charges. He is said to count upon
the new chairman of this committee
Senator Smith, of South Carolina, to
help him get the bill out of commit
tee.
According to Senator LaFollette’s
explanation of the bill containing
the proposed amendments, it will re
quire the Interstate Commerce Com
mission to fix railroad rates on the
basis of actual service costs. By costs
of service he means operating ex
penses plus actual capital cost, and
that, he explains, is interest on
bonds, plus fair dividends for stock
that represents money invested. “I
reject the theory,” he says, “that
public utilities have any right to
earn profits on inflated and fictitious
values.”
Thus the old bill comes back to the
old question of raihwy valuation,
whicn has been a bone of contention
for years, and which will be raised
again in the ample debates which
Will follow. Senator LaFollette con
tends that the opposition of the rail
ways has prevented the complete
fulfillment of the purposes of the
valuation act. His bill directs the
commission to fulfill its provisions
and to report the cost of the roads
to date. He says the bill is based
upon the principle that the private
owners of railroads are entitled to
be reimbursed for the actual cost of
the services they perform and to be
paid a fair return for the money
they have “prudently invested in
property now devoted to public serv
ice.”

COMMUNICATIONS REVEAL THE USELESSNESS OF
ANTI-KLAN ATTACK BY LEVANG’S WEEKLY
Ola’s Home Folks Freely Express Their Opinions and Indicate
the Trend of their Thoughts in Regards to K. K. K.
AN OPEN LETTER TO OLA LE
VANG
Dear Mr. Levang:
You continuously go out of your
way to feature Klansmen as sneaks,
cowards, spies, instigators of hate,
etc. I have known you for many
years and am, therefore, in a position
to understand your various stands on
men, movements, policies, programs
and events. But I am troubled some
what lest outsiders get a wrong im
pression of the people in Lanesboro
so I am taking this method of cor
rection. You know as well as I do
that you stand very nearly alone in
Lanesboro, so far as Protestants go,
in your uncompromising attitude
toward the great Protestant move
ment. You have ventured a guess
that only twenty-five Lanesboro men
are members of the Ku Klux Klan.
I must smile as I write when I com
pare the actual membership with
your guess. It is, of course, none of
your business how many Protestants
in and near Lanesboro have seen the
light of the new and better day.
It would be foolisjj. attempt an
answer to your ridiculous, yes, ab
surd, accusations centered against
the K. K. K. Your mind is not open
to conviction on the Klan question.
So why should I BTgue the matter?
Anyway you are so “sot on your
opinions” so far a» the Ku Klux Klan
is concerned that J see the useless
ness of attempting the impossible.
And on a second thought why is it
necessary to dignify your opposition
by means of any controversy with
you? lam satisfied that you are do
ing the Klan a good turn through
your antagonistic prattle. Rave on,
old man, rave on. When the broad
sides of the united-kept press and
thunderbolts of oratorical whirlwinds
have failed completely to stop the
Klan, it is reasonable to expect no
injury from a peanut-wagon weekly.
You might as well attempt to kill
an elephant with a tooth-brush as to
expect to destroy the Ku Klux Klan
with your publication.
Let it be known here and now that
very few Protestants are being turn
ed against the American Movement
by your “pop-offs.” Don’t let me.
however, discourage you in your work
in behalf of those who grin a silly
smile yhen they read your brain
products as printed in your weekly
If Martin Luther were on earth to
day and fighting for the great things
he believed in* with a burning zeal
born of a mental awakening, I would
expect to see Levang’s Weekly de
nouncing the Reformation movement.
That which you can’t understand de
serves your study before setting in
type erroneous conclusions coming as
a direct result of ignorance.
Yours truly,
An Old Friend.

Dear Editor:
You hit the nail on the head when
you stated editorially that a strong

Lanesboro community, now that Ola
Levang has come out against the K’s.

Dear Orn:
We have a rip-snorting editor down

heated belly. We have long read his

seriously.

Dear Editor Orn:
I am sending you several copies
of “Levang’s Weekly.” You will note
the marked articles. Wow, but he
slambangs the Klan something fierce.
Issue after, issue the Lanesboro
“Groucher” growls. I think Ola has
seven years' itch, and so can’t help
himself. Poor fellow.

Dear Editor:
Some of us have been reading Le
vang’s Weekly about the K. K. K.
and would like to join the order. We
want you to tell us who we can see
so that we can get on the inside. The
Klan is sure a good thing with Le
vang fighting it. Levang was for
Preus when the Governor wanted to
be Senator —and that helped Magnus
Johnson win.
Yours for America,

Dear “Twilight” Orn:
Heard your lecture here last sum
mer and enjoyed it very much. Your
words were good for all of us. Ola
Levang, however, has been slamming
the Klan ever since you were here.
We know why Ola Boola La La
Whang fights the Ku Klux Klan. He
thinks about Sidney Anderson’s 1 job
and is trying to get it. Ha! Ha!
It’s a joke—we must laugh.
Yours till the Cows Grow Feathers,

The Call of the North,
St. Paul, Minn.
Enclosed find clippings from Le
vang’s Weekly of Lanesboro. Le
vang does enjoy printing cracks at
the Klan but of the many people
that I talk to every day very few,
pay any attention to the “also-ran”
man from Lanesboro. Ola gets the
funniest ideas about the subject
“How to Get to Congress.” It looks
very much as if Levang is fighting
the Klan because he has a notion that
it will make people think he is “fear
less.” I know positively that Ola is
disappointed because he hasn’t been
given a coat of tar and feathers by
the Klan. He is just wrong enough
in his understanding of the Organ
ization to think that we are a band
of outlaws and self-appointed vigi
lantes. We who have followed Le
vang’s career know that Ola enioys
featuring his courage—in fact he
likes to parade the thing. Let him
parade, but only a few around here
will attend his circus.

Dear Editor, The Call of the North:
“Whimpers Weakly” of this town
continues hitting the Klu Kluxers
with reckless wildness. The Weak-
ly doesn’t care about facts neither
does it pay any attention to conclu
sive arguments so I have arrived at
the point in my thinking where I
consider the source and let it go at
that. Whimper’s Weakly is wrong
end to so frequently as to make the
thing look like what it is—Hillbilly’s
Howl.
A Klansman.
The Editor of Whimper’s Weakly
might just as well go out on a hill
and try to stop the clouds as to ex
pect his whimpers to affect the Klan
movement. We let the Hillbilly howl
around here and laugh up our sleeves.

Editor, Call of the North:
The burning of a fiery cross in this
vicinity brought forth several out
bursts on the part of Ola Levang.
He certainly searched the diction
ary for words that would serve as
instruments of vituperation. But he
overshot his mark and many who
thought Mr. Levang absolutely sin
cere in his opposition to the Ku Klux
Klan are now beginning to small a
mouse. There is not the least doubt
in my mind but that the motive back
of Levang’s anti-Klan stand is mere
ly a play for political support. You
perhaps have been informed con
cerning Levang’s attitude toward
Congressman Sidney Anderson. Le
vang’s Weekly has quite frequently
devoted space to bitter denunciation
of our Congressman. It would not
be strange to see an article in Le
vang’s Weekly with a headline “Syd
ney Anderson Joins Hooded Order of
Blackguards.” Politics sometimes
goes to man’s head and them most
anything can be expected. Mr. Le
vang certainly has not the following
he thinks he has. There are visible
signs in nearly all the communities
in this part of the state.
Very sincerely yours,
Preston, Minn.

The Call of the North:
I have been wondering whether or
not you have been getting copies of
Le Vang’s Weekly of Lanesboro. I

tion to the anti-Klan stuff that Le
Vang shoots. I have known the
Lanesboro editor for many years and
take whatever he writes with several
grains of salt. Personally I am glad
to see the editor of Lanesboro lined
up as an anti-Klanner. Mr. Le
Vang’s support certainly would do the
K. K. K. very little good, if any.

BISHOP’STAND CREATES
A STIR IN METHODIST
CHURCH
—K-K-K
Joseph H. Berry of Asbury Park Dis
trict, Would Bar Klansmen *
From Churches
—K-K-K
Asbury Park, N. J.—Great sur
prise and considerable resentment
has been occasioned in many Method
ist homes of this community by the
public statement of Bishop Joseph F.
Berry, senior bishop of the Methodist
Episcopal church in New Jersey, in
which, he said that members of the
Ku Klux Klan, as an organization,
should not be permitted in the
churches and that no money should
be accepted from them.
While the opinion has not been
conveyed to the New Jersey confer-
ence as an order, it is expected that
it will be presented in the near fu
ture. Developments are certain to
follow this order and they are await
ed anxiously by members of the
church. The Klan is said to be strong
in the Methodist churches along the
seashore, and naturally there has
been resentment against the unwar
ranted attack and attitude taken by
the bishop. , -
Co-operation Was Solicited
Methodist Episcopal clergymen in
this district have been cordial to the
organization, as there has been a pop
ular demand from members of their
congregations for a co-operative at
titude between the church and the
Klan. The Klan has been attending
many churches on the invitations of
ministers throughout the state.
Members of the church in this dis
trict are expecting the issue to be
brought up at the conference at At
lantic City in March.
It is difficult for members and pas
tors of the church to form any de
fense for the stand taken by the
bishop. The prosperity of the con
gregations since the advent of the
Klan has been unparalleled in the his
tory of Methodism in this district.
Church attendance has increased
while the spiritual atmosphere has
correspondingly healthy growth. The
Klan is looked on as being vital to
the. preservation of the church from
a national standpoint.
Hasty Decision
A Klansman of this community, in
a recent statement, said: “It looks
as though members of the Ku Klux
Klan will have to build churches to
accommodate the 1,500,000 Method
ists who are members of the organ
ization. I cannot understand why
the bishop has made such an unwar
ranted attack, unless it is because he
has no information and is ignorant
of the true principles for which the
Klan is striving. The organization
has been working for the churches
of this district. It is certain that if
we are not invited to attend the
Methodist Episcopal churches we will
go elsewhere a« a body. I believe
that Bishop Berry has made a hasty
decision and will regret it.”
