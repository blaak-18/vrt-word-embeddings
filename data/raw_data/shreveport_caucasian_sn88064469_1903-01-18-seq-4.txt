THE WATER WORKS COMPANY
AND THE CITY.
It has been announced that the Water
Works Company intend to submit to
the city council a proposition which, if
accepted, will decrease the rate 'being
paid by the city at least forty per cent.
What is the purpose of this reduction
and why is it suggested?
There is not in the South, and we
may say in the United States,- a plant
which, through its charter, has greater
advantages than is possessed by the
Shreveport Water Works Company,
whose franchise will expire in 1913. It
is most valuable and a ready money
maker for the company, which, under
the conditions of its existence, receives
seven per cent per annum on the
amounts outlaid in the extension and
construction of its system of water
works and sewers. The company can
not be held blamable for this payment
of seven per cent, when money could
be obtained at 4 per cent-it is simply
one of the many advantages which are
connected with one of the most liberal
grants ever written aiO incorporated.
`'Under the provisions of this grant the
cndipany requires. the city to pay $30
ott each of -o6 hydrants and $40 for
sch additional hydrant. It has been
cogmuted that at these rates of charges
the Water Works Company would
about absorb the revenues of the city
and there ire from this point of view
Mayor Querbes- suggested the acquire
ment by the city of the, waterworks
plant. A is; well known by its readers.
the Catksian. has been an opponent of
wt. IS termed unicipsal ownership,

Drink water and you get typhoid.
Drink milk and get tnberculosis. Drink
whiskey and get ,jimjams. Eat white
flour and get appendicitis. Bkt soup and
get Bright's disease. Eat beef and en
courage apoplexy. Eat oysters and ac
quire toxemia. Eat meats of any kind
and get indigestion or some kind of
germ disease. Eat vegetables and weak
en the system. Eat deserts and take on
paresis. Smoke cigarettes and die early.
Smoke cigars and secure a nice catarrh.
Drink coffee and tea and obtain nervous
prostration. Drink beer and have the
dyspepsia. Drink wine and get the gout.
In order to be entirely healthy one must
eat nothing, drink nothing. smoke noth
ing, and even before breathing one
should see that the air is properly ster
ilized.-Commercial Appeal.
Even then it may be unsafe to he
about and risk contact with one of the
billions of billiouscussusi or malariati
which may creep into air after it has
been sterilized. However, in a spirit of
detraction one, without snakes in his
boots, may challenge the allegations and
defy the allegators.
It is noted tlt the newspapers are
giving gratuitous advice to the farmer
how to grow hogs. There is no particu
lar time when hogs are about. but we
do not understand why the farmer
should be told to raise hogs. It is true
a good hog, of improved breed, will fur
nish from 25o to ,oo pounds of meat.
besides the etceteras. but if the farmer
can get his hog, all cured from the store,
why should he worry raising it, at least
on feed? The average editor may know
a good deal about hogs. but we "opine"
his familiarity with the swine breed may
be limited.
In a jocular vein the Harlequin. of
New Orleans. referring to the State
Democratic Central Committee has in
head-lines: "Eh, Lebas Central Com
mittee? We Have Primaries. Eh, or We
Don't Have? And That Platform. When
and How Do We Build Him?" Har
lequin's interrogatories are significant.
The- Central Committee may and may
'not, but there is a fact which the State
-Demoeratic Committee should consider
earnestly, and it is: That the-great ma
jority of Pemocrats who vote are in
favor of; nominations by primary elec
tions, a.d please" do not forget it."
