RETURNED TO THE FARM.
The Mansfield Journal says:
"C. \V. Smith has resigned the pos;
tion of deputy sheriff and will move
hack to his farm on Red bayou. .1lr.
Smith has made an efficient officer and
his friends regret to see him and !his
estimable family leave our town.
The life on the farm may not be as
exciting nor as alluring as the town. but
there can be no place on earth better
than the farm which receives intelligent
attention. It is a wise man who will
stick to his farm.
DIED OF HIS WOUNDS.
The negro, Charles Hewitt. who was
shot by Jim Walpoole, colored, Christ
mas night six miles from Shreveport,
is dead: Walpoole is charged with mur
der. From all accounts the murder was
brutal and unprovoked.
THE CITY COURT.
During the absence of Judge C. D.
Hicks, who has been ill at his home,
the functions of the city judge have been
discharged creditably and satisfactorily
by Hon. W. E. Maples, who has dealt
even-handed justice to all the unfortun
ates called before him. He has been len
ient with violators of the ordinances on
Christmas evening and Christmas day,
and for this he should be commended
A poor devil of a fellow who has sinned
on Christmas day by an infraction of
the city laws is entitled to some consid
eration. Judge Maples will continue to
fulfill the duties of judge of the city
court until relieved by Judge Hicks.

BRAVE CU.:DUCTOR.
He Followed a Train Robber and Shoots
Him With a Winchegter
Louisville, Ky., Dec. 31.-Conductor
J. D. Keen had a desperate struggle
on his train on the Louisville and
Nashville, New Orleans and Cincinna
ti northbound express, yesterday morn
ing albout 2::w30 o'(lock when nearing
South Loijisvillo, and as a result he
'as shot by a robhher over the left tem
ple. Conductor Keen is confident he
killed or monrtalv wounded a robber
with a bullet from Winchester rifle. The
train rea(hed this city at 3:3). and at
4:00 o'clock a special train of one
coach and an engine left the Tenth
Street station for the scene of the
holdup. The train was manned by a
large number of police and Louisville
and Nashville employes to search for
the dead body.
The train was just entering the lim
its of South Louisville, and all passen
gers in the Pullman were asleep, Con
ductor Keen was passing through the
car, as his habit just before entering
the Louisville station. As he entered
the car the figure of a man wearing a
mask jumped from a dark corner of
the car and with a drawn revolver
commanded Keen to throw up his
hands.
Instead of throwing up his hands he
grappled with the robber. A pistol
ball momentarily stunned Keen and
the robber pulled bel cord. but before
the train stopped the highwayman
proceeded to rob the passengers in the
sleeper. He held up Joseph Redford.
the Pullman conductor, and J. F.
Moore, a passenger, taking $25 from
the latter.
As the train slowed down the rob
ber jumped off, but followed by Con
ductor Keen, who secured a Winches
ter. The conductor hurried after the
robber, firing as he went, and emp
tied his rifle at the retreating burglar.
At one shot the fleeing man let out a
yell of pain. The firing aroused all
passengers on the train and caused
considerable excitement.

WV. T. FOSTER S FORECASTS.
The Youngstown. Ohio, Vindicator of
r(th editorially says:
"The weather predictions of W. T.
Fostcr of St. Joseph, Mo., which are
printed from time to time in the col
umns of the Vindicator, have crused
much comment because they hit the
weather much better than the govern
ment forecasts from day to day. Snce
the first of September the Missnuri
weather man's predictions have aver
aged high. His prediction of a wrrm
November is worthy of note, and his
forecast of a cold wave for the presmnt
week with a temperature averaging le
low normal speaks well for the accuracy
with which he hits the weather whmI
most people would scarcely look for a
change."
The town council of Opelousas ha;
fixed the liquor license for 1903 a:
$2000. being the same rate as in 1902.
during which six saloons were operated.
and yet some saloon men in Shreveport
object to a $5oo0 license.
