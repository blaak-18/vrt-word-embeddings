LOUISIANA REDEEMED.
[Lexington ("Mo.) Caucasian.]
Louisiana, queenly and bcautilul
in tho weeds other widowhood, in
the shackes of her captivity, in the
ashes of her desolation and humilia
l ion—Louisiana, bright land of the
olive and vine, of the pomegranate,
jflyrtlo and pine, long bowed be
neath the foul oppressor's yoke—
Louisiana is free ! Brethren, sing !
The whole Democratic state ticket
and live out of six congressmen
elected. Jubilate, thank God ! Such
tidings should send a thrill of sym
pathetic joy tingling to the heart of
every true maifin America. Since
the days of Least .Huiler, Louisia
na's proud people have endured
every indignity, every iniquity, ev
ery outrage, that tho ingenuity of
yankees, niggers and thieves could
devise. Her rich plantations have
been laid waste. Her hospitable
mansions have been burned, or ten
dered dwelling-places for the owls
and bats. Her beauteous gardens
have been made a desert. Her
magnificent forests have been hewn
down. Her very altars and grave
yards have been desecrated by offi
cial ruflians, omnipresent vandals,
blasphemer.-, and body-snatchers.—
Her lands have been mortgaged
for more than they are worth. Her
commerce has died. Her credit is
gone. From the front rank of the
grand sisterhood of States, she has
sunk to a weed-draped beggar, era
ving pity and alms along the way
side of the world. From t he noble
seat'of a soverign and independent
commonwealih, she bas been
«'ragged down a chaiuedand groan
ing' captive, trampled under foot,
pin ned and spit upon, by the foul
st scum Africa, and Yankeedom.
Tom her imperial position of
wealth and power, she has been
crushed into abject woe and pan
perism. All, all that was good or
desiiable has been torn from her,
but her honor and the brave hearts
of her sons. And tlf.'se tdout, hero
hearts have saved her. Ju all her
hours of deepest darkness, iii all
her anguish and bitter wrongs, they
have never faltered. Though their
streets bave been patrolled by hire
ling soldiery, their country scoured
by barbarian dragoons, their rivers
narded by hostile gun-boats—in
spite of bayonets, sabres and chains,
in spite of brutal gaolers and pris
on-cells, they, the true men of Lou
isiana, have never wavered in their
martyrlike fealty to their suffei
mother-state. They have hoped
when hope seemed insanity. They
have prayed, when prayer appear
ed a mockery. They have strug
gled, when struggling boded but
destruction. And at last, at long,
long last, they have triumphed.—

Why tho 2utter Did'nt Como.
They have a new hired girl over
at Keyscr's farm, just outside our
town, and on Tuesday, before start
ing to spend the day with a friend
Mrs. Kcyser instructed tho girl to
to whitewash the kitchen during
her absence. Upon returning,Mrs.
Kcyser found the job completed in
a very satisfactory manner. On
Wednesdays Mrs. Kcyser always
burns, and last Wednesday when
she was ready she went out, and,
finding that Mr. Kcyser had al
ready put the milk into tho churn,
she began to turn the handle
This was at eight o'clock in the
morning, and she turned until ten
wit hout any signs of butter appear
ing.. Then she called in tho hired
man and he turned until dinner
time, when ho knocked off with
some very offensive language ad
oressed to that butter which had
not yet come.
After dinner the hired girl took
hold <d' the crank and turned it en
ergetic.ally until two o'clock, when
she let go with a remark which
conveyed the impression that she
believed the churn to bo haunted.
Then Mr. Keyer came out and said
he wanted to know what was the
matter with tho churn anyhow. It
was a good enough churn it people
only knew enough to work it. Mr.
Kcyser then worked the crank un
til half-past three, when, as the
butter had 7iot come, he surrender
ed it again to the hired man be
cause ho had an engagement in the
village. The man ground tho ma
chine to an accompaniment of
frightful imprecations; then the
Kcyser children each took a turn
for half an hour; then Mrs. Kcyser
tried her han«l, and when she was
exhausted she. again enlisted the
hired girl, who said her prayers
But the butter
er idnocent swearing, and then he
seized tho handle and said he'd
make the butter come or kick up
an earthquake. .Mr. Kcyser effect

The petroleum men are great

A Western paper chronicles a
marriage in this suggestive style:
" The couple resolved themselves
into a committee ot two, with pow

A farmer, while tlaggellating two
of his unruly boys, was asked what
he was was doing. "Thrashing

A Missouri paper says: "Yes

boxes complaining of hard 'times."
A rude follow once told Barnum
that he had never exhibited any
thing that was not a barefaced
humbug " Yes I have," said Bar

Susan, how in the word did you
ever marry that brute ?" " Oh, I

A Pennsylvania seven-year old
was reproved lately for plaving out
doors with boys; she was 'tob big
for that now. But with all imagi
nable innocence she replied:
" Why, gramma, the bigger wo
grow the better wo like 'em."
The Squantum Debating Socie
ty proposes discussing the gram
matical construction of the signs
displayed in public parks. " Please
keep off the grass." Grass, it is
argued, does not fall upon you ;
and why, then, should you be ask
ed to keep it off ?
" Do you believe there are any

the precocious young brother.
" Where are they, 1 should like to

Little words are the sweetest to
hear; little charities fly farthest
and stay longest on the wing; lit
tle lakes are the stillest; little
hearts are tho fullest, and little
farms aro the best tilled. Little
books are the most read, and little
songs the dearest loved. And
when nature would make anything
especially rare and beautiful, she
makes it little—little pearls, little
diamonds, little dews. Agar's is a
beautiful prayer, but then it is a
little one, and the burden ot the pe
tition is for but little. The sermon
on the mount is little, but the last
dedication discourse was an hour.
Life is made up of littles; death is"
what remains of them all. Day is
made up of little beams, and night
is glorious with little stars.
If you war.t to see how beautiful
your wife looks when she's angry,
suggest that the young lady who
lives across the street, and who al
ways sits at the window with her
forefinger pressed to her temple
and a pensive smilo on her face
while you 're smoking your evening
cigar, is the handsomest woman
yon ever saw. Take care that
your head is not out of the window
when you make the remark. This
was the situation with Mr. Spell
backer the other evening. Tin»,

he hadn 't time to'get all his head '
m and be doesn't look well half
scalped.
