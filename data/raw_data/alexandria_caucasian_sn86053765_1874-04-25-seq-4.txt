A DUMB VICTIM LEFT TO Dre FROM
TIIE EFFECTS OF tiip tnirukléa.
Amid tho biistle of a large'city
like oars, tlierc are many sad acci
dents happening daily, which re
sult in the death or the maiming
for'lifo of some poor craitnro who
perhaps, by the inscrutable dispen
sation ot Providence are too poor
even to receive the medical.aid
which would save them from a pre-'
mature grave, or prevent their be
coming helpless cripples for the
balance of their days. It is our sad
duty, amid the many items of news
which-fill our columns, to chronicle
the occurrence of one of the most
horrible and heartrending accidents
that has occurred iu our city for
many days. o
Two nights ago, while Mr. Jack
Asinus, who by some freak of na
ture has been for many years de
prived of the powers of speech was
wending his. way homeward and
baing buried in deep thought, was
about crossing, the railroad track
as car No. 51, of the Crescent City
line, was coAiing along at i all speed,
was kuoekpd down perfectly sense
less, the. wheels of the cars passing
oVer his legs and erushing them
almost to a pulp. JN'ot being able
to give vent in words to the agoi>y
he sufïered, the groans that ever
and anon broke from him were
enough to curgtle the blood and
cause the most calons hearted to
the deepest pity for his misery.
Vain were the efforts of the many
spectators to gain© an y clue as to
the home of the sufferer; he could
not Explain where ho lived, and be
ing uneducated, was nnable even
to write the street where he li©ed.
No one seemed to know him, and
there he lay with the cold and chill
ing night air heightening the tor
ture of his mangled limbs, which
for hours had been left without
• -( sm • :V
medical assistance. Even as late
as \ esterday the poor creature was
lying on the side of the track where
the accident 'occurred.
Mr. Asinus bein£ very poor, and
only earning^iis living by daily
toil, has now, iu the time of
misfortune but few friends to at
tend to his injuries. But it is hoped
that the authorities will have that
o
mule removed from Ctiij^wea
street, as it has been lying there
fry 'two (lavs„ and has become a
nuisance to the neighborhood.—|"A r .

When the Forty-niner and his

countenance assumed a ghastly ex

his newly made wife to her friends,
and turned anxiously to the stran

to talk with you a moment private

haifTto conceal his emotion, and
finally said: u I assure you, sir
that—that—what in thunder did

for V' " A moment will suffice,' 7
replied the funeral-looking gentle
man firmly, " please step into this
pew." The F'orty-niner did so.
while the assembled company busi

fainting bride and agonized bride

man, "it. is necessary for him to

was a chorus of female shrieks, and
a general rush of .gentlemen, as the

Thfe enterprising cemetery agent
was quickly disposed of, the trem-.

little boy wouldn't tell a lie, ho in

the last day of March, ho was jnst
10 years old, and his father asked
hitn what he wcmld liko to have for
n birthday present. Very naturally
the boy's answer -was: "A little
hatchet, if yon please, papa'"
The father bought him a' little
hatchet that very day, and the boy
was so delighted that ho actually
took it to bed with him.
Early nest mcrning ho got up
dressed himself, took his little hs»tchet
and went out into the garden.
There, as lnck would hava £r, the
lirst ti;ing that caught his eya was
his father's favorite cherry tree.

" My eyes V 9 esclaizned ilie lilfclo boy

Ho consulted Father Ireland, of St.

pressed themselves as possessing, a fa
vorable impression of the principles,
objects and methods ot the grange, bat
neither of them could Ifltoak though tho
absolute rule of the .church, and tßey
recommended the legislator to appeal
to Rome. . /'
He accordingly laid the matter be
fore tho Pope, to whom'he transmitted
atHhe same time full particulars as to
the objects contemplated by the order,
and tlio means by which it was pro
posed to attain them.
A reply .lias,been received from Iiis
Holiness, stating that the Pope allows
the petition^to joiu the Grange of

ber thereof, if he find nothing therein
conflict with his conscience, or the
creed of tho Catholic Churqh rii
As a congregation, the order has
received a large accession in Minneso
ta, and v hen the news of the Pope's
decision has reached other Statee, its
effects will be largely to increase tho
numbèrs of tho patrons, and to remove
the interdict laid upon Catholics dé
sirions of becoming such, by prelates,
