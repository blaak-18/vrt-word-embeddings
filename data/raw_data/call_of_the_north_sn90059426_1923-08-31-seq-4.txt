THE FLAG:
On Flag Day, June 14, representa
tives of 68 organizations met in
Washington for a conference, called
by and conducted under the auspices
of The American Legion, to draft an
authentic code of flag etiquette. The
code drafted by that conference is
printed in the Call of the North be
cause there seems to be considerable
uncertainty where there should be
none.
While the rules adopted by the con
ference have no official government
sanction, nevertheless they represent
the authoritive opinion of the principal
patriotic bodies of the United States
and of Army and Navy experts, and
are binding on all of the organiza
tions which took part in the gather
ing. The conference constituted it
self a permanent body, so that modifi
cations in the rules can be made if
this proves desirable. The rules as
given below are from the final cor
rected draft of the code as brought
out of the conference. Legion posts
will find the rules and diagrams
worth calling to the notice of school
pupils and citizens generally.
There are certain fundamental rules
of heraldry which, if understood gen
erally, would indicate the proper
method of displaying the flag. The
matter becomes a very simple one if
it is kept in mind that the National
Flag represents the living country
and is itself considered as a living
thing. The union of the flag is the
honor joint; the right arm is the
sword arm, and therefore the point
of danger and hence the place of
honor.
1. The Flag should be displayed
only from sunrise to sunset, or be
tween such hours as may be designat
ed by proper authority. It should be
displayed on national and state holi
days and on historic and special oc
casion. The flag should always be
hoisted briskly and lowered slowly and
ceremoniously.
2. When carried in a procession
with another flag or flags, the Flag
of the United States should be either
on the marching right, i. e., the
Flag’s own right, or when there is a
line of other flags the Flag of the
United States may be in front of the
center of that line.
3. When displayed with another
flag against a wall from crossed
staffs, the Flag of the United States
should be on the right, the Flag’s own
right, and its staff should be in front
of the staff of the other flag.
4. When a number of flags are
grouped and displayed from staffs, the
Flag of the United States should be
in the enterc or at the highest point
oi the group.
5. When flags of States or cities
or pennants of societies are flown on
the same halyard with the Flag of the
United States, the National Flag
should always be at the peak. When
flown from adjacent staffs the Flag
of the United States should be hoist
ed first. No flag or pennant should
be placed above or to the right of
the Flag of the United States.
6. When flags of two or more na
tions are displayed they should be
flown from separate staffs of the
same height and the flags should be
of approximately equal size. Inter
national usage forbids the display of
the flag of one nation above that of
another nation in time of peace.)
7. When the Flag is displayed
from a staff projecting horizontally
or at an angle from the window sill,
balcony, or front of building, the
union of the Flag should go clear to
the head of the staff unless the Flag
is at half mast.
8. When the Flag of the United
States is displayed in a manner other
than by being flown from a staff it
should be displayed flat, whether in
doors or out. When displayed either
horizontally or vertically against a
wall, the union should be uppermost
and to the Flag’s own right, i. e., to
the observer’s left. When displayed
in a window it should be displayed the
same way, that is, with the union or
blue field to the left of the observer
in the street. When festoons, roset
tes, or drapings of blue, white and
red are desired bunting should be
used, but never the Flag.
9. When displayed over the mid
dle of the street, as between build
ings, the Flag of the United States
should be suspended vertically with
the union to the north in an east-and
west street or to the east in a north
and-south street.
10. When used on a speaker’s plat
form, the Flag should be displayed
above and behind the speaker. It
should never be used to cover the
speaker’s desk nor to drape over the
front of the platform. If flown
from a staff it should be on the speak
er’s right.
11. When used in unveiling a sta
tue or monument, the Flag should
not be allowed to fall to the ground
but should be carried aloft to wave
out, forming a distinctive feature dur
ing the remainder of the ceremony.
12. When flown at half staff, the
Flag is first hoisted to the peak and
then lowered to the half staff posi
tion, but before lowering the Flag
for the day it is raised again to the
peak. On Memorial Day, May 30, the
Flag is displayed at half staff from
sunrise until noon and at full staff
from noon until sunset, for the Na
tion lives and the Flag is the symbol
e# the living Nation.
18. When used to cover a casket
HOW TO DISPLAY IT
HOW TO RESPECT IT
the Flag should be placed so that the
union is at the head and over the left
shoulder. The Flag should not be
lowered into the grave nor allowed
to touch the ground. The casket
should be carried foot first.
14. When the Flag is displayed
in church it should be from a staff
placed on the congregation’s right as
they face the cleryman. The serv
ice flag, the state flag, or other flag
should be at the left of the congrega
tion. If in the chancel, the Flag of
the United States should be placed
on the clergyman’s rights as he faces
the congregation and other flags on
his left.
15. When the Flag is in such a
condition that it is no longer a fitting
emblem for display it should not be
cast aside or used in any way that
might be viewed as disrespectful to
the national colors, but should be de
stroyed as a whole, privately, prefer
ably by burning or by some other
method in harmony with the reverence
and respect we owe to the emblem
representing our county.
Cautions.
1. Do not permit disrespect to be
shown to the Flag of the United
States.
2. Do not dip the nag of the
United States to any person or any
thing. The regimental color, state
flag, organization or institutional
flag will render this honor.
3. Do not let the Flag of the
United States touch the ground or
trail in the water.
4. Do not place any object or em
blem of any kind on or above the
Flag of the United States.
5. Do not use the Flag as drap
ery in any form whatever. Use
bunting of blue, white and red.
6. Do not fasten the Flag in such
manner as will permit it to be eas
ily torn.
7. Do not drape the Flag over the
hood, top, sides or back of a vehicle,
or of a railroad train or boat. When
the Flag is displayed on a motor car,
the staff should be affixed firmly to
the chassis or clamped to the radiator
cap.
8. Do not display the Flag on a
float in a parade except from a staff.
9. Do i not use the Flag as a cov
ering for a ceiling.
10. Do not use the Flag as a por
tion of a costume or of an athletic
uniform. Do not embroider it upon
cushions or handkerchiefs or print it
on paper napkins or boxes.
11. Do not put lettering of any
kind upon the Flag.
12. Do not use the Flag in any
form of advertising nor fasten an ad
vertising sign to a pole from which
the Flag of the United States is
flying.
13. Do not display, use or store
the Flag in such a manner as will
permit it to be easily soiled or dam
aged.
Proper Use of Bunting.
Bunting of the national colors
should be used for covering a speak
er’s desk, draping over the front of a
nlatform and for decoration in gen
eral. Bunting should be arranged
with the blue above, the white in
the middle and the red below.
Salute to the Flag.
During the ceremony of hoisting
or lowering the Flag or when the
Flag is passing in a parade or in a
review, all persons present should
face the Flag, stand at attention and
salute. Those present in uniform
should render the right-hand salute.
When not in uniform, men should re
move the headdress with the right
hand and hold it at the left shoulder.
Women should salute by placing the
right hand over the heart. The sa
lute to the Flag in the moving col
umn is rendered at the moment the
Flag passes.
When the National Anthem is
olayed those present in uniform
should salute at the first note of the
anthem, retaining this position until
the last note of the anthem. When
not in uniform, men should remove
the headdress and hold it as in the
salute to the Flag. Women should
render the salute as to the Flag.
When there is no Flag displayed, all
should face toward the music.

FLIVVER “POULTRY”
Of the old tin Ford everybody
makes fun. They say is was made
in ’9l. Maybe it was, but this HI
bet, she’s good for many a long mile
yet. The windshield is broken and
the radiator leaks, the fan belt slips
and the engine squeaks. She has
shaken the screws and the nuts all
loose, but I get fifteen miles from a
gallon of juice. When I can’t get gas
I burn kerosene, and I sometimes
even use Paris green. There’s a rat
tle in front and a grind in the rear,
and a Chinese puzzle for a steering
gear. Her coils are dead and her
plugs won’t fire and the piston rings
are bailing wire. But in spite of
this she pulls me through and that’s
all any car will do. With high
priced cars they give you tools, some
extra parts and a book of rules; but
a wire stretcher and a pair of shears,
are all I ever carried all these years.
And if I live to see the day she falls
to pieces like the one hoss shay, and
old Hank Ford stays in the game, I'll
buy another by the same eld mams.

KLANSMAN
(Continued from page 1)
the time. Education, immigration,
obedience of the law and white racial
supremacy were the four topics of an
address to the Klansmen, at the con
clusion of the initiation ceremony by
Dr. Evans.
The Pittsburgh Press.
Of the ten seriously injured, three
were stabbed, four were shot, and
three had their skulls fractured by
bricks. The dead man and all the
seriously injured are Klansmen.
The rioting occurred when the
Klansmen attempted to enter the
borough over the Glendale Bridge.
They were halted by a mob of over
two thousand citizens many of whom
were armed. As the Ku Klux Klan
members descended from the hillside
where they had held their meeting,
men and boys brandishing fire arms
and clubs shouted threats to the on
coming throng. When the first
Klansman stepped over the borough
line a band of citizens rushed toward
him. He was knocked to the ground.
The riot followed. The Klansmen
waved flags and shouted, their voices
adding to the din raised by the yells
of the citizens and cries of the in
jured. A thirty-two calibre automa
tic revolver was used in shooting the
Klansman, who was found mortally
wounded. A half a dozen revolver
shots were fired from ambush into
the road where sentinels of the Klan
had been stationed. Cries of “Get a
rope,” “Lynch them,” “Kill them” and
similar threatening expressions filled
the air. Leaders of the Klan held
a pow wow on the hill shortly before
the parade started and it is said,
received the advice of attorneys that
the burgess of Carnegie had no au
thority to stop the parade as long as
it was orderly and lawful.
The Pittsburgh Gazette-Times.
Patrick McDermott, aged 65, un
dertaker of Carnegie, was held in con
nection with the death of the Klans
man during the riot early yesterday.
Three other men are being held in
the county jail in connection with
the riot. They gave their names as
Walter K. Flaherty, and Joseph
Joyce and Lawrence Kim el.
Imperial Wizard’s Statement
Dr. Evans characterized his state
ment issued tonight as “An official
statement to the people of the United
States concerning the murder of
Klansman Abbott during a riot when
parading Klansmen were attacked by
a lawless mob of Carnegie, Pa., Sat
urday night.” The statement fol
lows:
The action of the mob of Carnegie
residents sensed of anarchy. The
Klansmen of western Pennsylvania
gathered on a hill side overlooking
Carnegie early in the evening, and
following the initiation of one thou
sand men into the order paraded in
the direction of the town. They

weA halted at a bridge separating
Glendale from Carnegie by trucks and
other vehicles barring the road, mis
siles of every description were
thrown at the Klansmen. Fence
pailing, bricks, stones, coal, in fact
every object which could possibly
maim the law-abiding Klansmen
were hurled at them.
“In an effort to prevent their Con
stitutional rights of peaceable assem
bly being abridged by an element of
citizenry absolutely dangerous to the
safety and cause of freedom, the
Klansmen moved forward a square,
where the attacking forces made
ready for their coming with a bul
wark of paving stones and bricks.
A shower of these missiles fell on the
Klansmen. The civilians began fir
ing from a dark side street and
Klansman Abbott was mortally
wounded. The Klansmen in com
pliance with request of assembled de
puty sheriffs went back to the meet
ing place on the hillside; then re
turned to their homes.
“Klansman Abbott was killed be
cause he exercised his Constitutional
ly guaranteed right of peaceable as
sembly, free speech, and free move
ment over the highways of our coun
try.
“We are determined that this and
other parts of our great land shall be
made safe for native born Americans
and that every right given us in the
Constitution made by our fore-fathers
shall be preserved to us and to our
country.”
Dr. Evans also stated that the Klan
would pay a reward of twenty-five
hundred dollars for the arrest and
conviction of the murderer or mur
derers of Klansman Abbott. Rewards
now total $7,600 from Klan sources.
The Pittsburgh Gazette-Times.
Peaceful in it final rest the body
of Thomas R.. Abbott, aged 24 of
Atlasburg, who was shot in an attack
on the Ku Klux Klan in Carnegie,
Saturday night, reposed last night in
homes of relatives in Atlasburg. The
Abbott home yesterday was deserted
while the widow and the two children
of the slain man stayed with rela
tives, Mr. and Mrs. B. F. McMillan
of Atlasburg. There, about 100
Klansmen stood vigil over the body
through the night. Discussing her
husband's death Mrs. Abbott said
that she felt Mr. Abbott’s life had
been given to a noble and just cause.
“It is no disgrace to have him die
as he did,” she said. “But,” she con
tinued between sobs, “How sorry I
am that it happened.” Men about
the McMillan home who said they
were Klansmen, expressed their sor
row by lauding the purpose for
which the young man, who had served
four years in the Navy during the
world war, died. Mr. Abbott is sur
vived by his widow and two children,

months; his mother, Mrs. Harriet
Abbott of Carnegie; one sister, Mrs.
James Donnelly of Carnegie; and
two brothers Frank of Carnegie and
Elton of Ambridge.
The Pittsburgh Post.
At the height of the fight in east
Main street according to the story
of one of the witnesses, as related by
Chief Braun, McDermott ran out to
the pavement flournishing a revolver.
An instant later there were flashes
of fire and the same number of ex
plosions from th,e undertaker’s revolv
er. The witness says, the man who
later proved to be Abbott, staggered
and fell. Continued the witness who
told Chief Braun, according to that
official, that he turned to McDermott,
who was right behind him and cried
“My God” Paddy, why, why did you
shoot that man in cold blood.” Mc-
Dermott looked at him an instant and
then without saying a word ran down
a nearby alley, the witness said. “It
was two hours later when McDermott
was arrested,.” One of the marchers
bearing an American flag was snatch
ed from the ground. The flag van
ished. There were cheers and cries
of “Kill them/’ “Get a rope and
lynch them.”
Then a single voice among the
Klansmen called “Let us go.” With
this signal the marchers began to
push forward, there was no arguing
or struggling among the Klansmen.
Three marchers stepped on each side
of the stranded automobile and then
began to fill in the ranks and march
toward the main section of the
borough.
The second line of marchers hard
ly had gone 10 feet before the electric
cross on the automobile was torn
down and smashed. This was follow
ed by a hail of bricks and clubs at
the marching Klansmen. The parade
continued its way down Third street.
The hail of bricks continued. The
crowd was evenly divided. Some
cheered others jeered, as the head of
the parade reached Barrett Way,
shooting began. Bystanders rushed
for shelter. Women and children
screamed. In a second the street was
filled with rioters. When the shoot
ing started one of the Klansmen was
seen to drop in the street. He was
picked up and carried into the office
of Dr. F. B. Jones, Jr. where he died
a short time later.
