KLAN’S ELECTION
VICTORY AFFECTS
SMITH CAMPAIGN
Politicians Say Taggert
Will Not Swing Delega

McADOO IS STRONG MAN
New York Executive Will Need
Help of Hoosier and Buckeye
Delegations
(Special to The Fiery Crons)
NEW YORK, N. Y., May 12.—A
queer phenomenon has taken place in
national politics. A Republican
state primary election may seriously
affect the national Democratic elec
tion to be held in this city in June.
For some time Governor Alfred E.
Smith of New York state, exponent
of the liquor interests, has been run
ning strong in his candidacy for the
Democratic nomination for president.
It is generally conceded that Will
iam G. McAdoo has the strongest
hold on the delegates to the Demo
cratic convention. To win over Mc-
Adoo, Smith will necessarily have to
swing behind him the Indiana and
Ohio delepates. Indiana has 30 dele
gates and Ohio 4b.
However, the result of the Indiana
state primary election has changed
things. In short, Indiana has gone
Ku Klux. Edward Jackson, Republi
can. secretary of state, was nominat
ed for the governorship by a major
ity over the other five candidates in
the field put together. He defeated
Lew Shank, mayor of Indianapolis,
and anti-Klan candidates by a 10 to
1 ratio.
And the Democratic party of Indi
ana is as much in the hands of the
Klan as the Republican. Conse
quently, being a politician, Thomas
Taggert, Indiana Democratic boss,
will not attempt to stem the storm
by going for Smith in the national
convention, who is bitterly opposed
by all Protestant Americans. To do
so would seriously hamper the fomr-
Ing of his state tickets.
Democratic leaders here concede
that the Indiana election is a blow
to the Smith boom and may result
fatally. The reason is that Ohio is
just as strong a Klan state as Indi
ana, and consequently Smith can ex
pect little support from that delega
tion.
DOTHAN, ALA. One hundred
members of the Klan, in full regalia,
conducted the funeral here recently
of George Parker, who was killed in
a railroad accident.

NEWS REVIEW OF
CURRENT EVENTS
Senate Changes Tax Bill to
Accord With the Views
of the Democrats.
By EDWARD W. PICKARD
IT LOOKS as if the Republicans
must go before the country in the
Presidential campaign with a tax re
daction law mainly of Democratic
fashioning. This If the changes in the
house measure made by the senate are
sustained In conference and if the bill
Is not vetoed by Mr. Coolldge. The
Democrats then would have gained
one of the big political advantages for
which they have been striving.
With the aid of the radical Re
publican senators and the two Parmer-
Laborltes, the Democrats In the sei*
ste last week forced the acceptance of
the Simmons substitute tax bill by the
committee of the whole. In place of
the Mellon plan. It fixes the surtax
maximum at 40 per cent, and the nor
mal tax rates at 2 per cent on net in
come up to $4,000, 4 per cent between
$4,000 and SB,OOO, and 6 per cent above
SB,OOO.
Under the Simmons surtax schedule
a rate of 1 per cent applies on Income
between SIO,OOO and $14,000, instead of
1 per cent between SIO,OOO and $12,-
000, as In the Mellon plan, nnd 1 per
cent between SO,OOO and SIO,OOO, as In
the present law. The rates then ad
vance by 1 per cent in intervals of
$2,000 and $4,000 until 30 per cent is
reached on Income In excess of $90,000
and not In excess of SIOO,OOO. A rate
of 37 per cent applies between SIOO,-
000 and $200,000, 38 per cent between
$200,000 and $300,000, 39 per cent be
tween $300,000 and $500,000, and 40
per cent on that portion of Income in
excess of $500,000.
Next the Democratic-radical Repub
lican combination put Into the bill the
Democratic graduated corporation tax
and the Democratic substitute for the
estate tax. The former provides that
corporation earnings be subject to a
normal tax of 9 per cent, and undi
vided earnings In excess of specified
exemptions would be subject to sur
taxes ranging from a fourth of 1 per
cent to 40 per cent. This would be a
substitute for the 14 per cent flat tax
already approved by the senate In lieu
of the present tax of per cent on
corporation earnings, and the present
capital stock tax, which is to be re
pealed.
The estate tax is changed to an in
heritance tax, and provides that on a
transfer to a husband, wife, child,
adopted child, parent, or grandchild of
the decedent a tax of 1 per cent up to
$25,000 shall apply, with a graduated
tax on larger amounts up to a maxi
mum of 36 per cent of the amount in
excess of $5,000,000. These rates shall
be Increased by 25 per cent In the case
of a transfer to a brother, sister,
nephew, or niece of the decedent. The
rates are increased by 50 per cent in
the case of a transfer to any other
person. Exemptions are $25,000 for
husband or wife SIO,OOO for a parent,
child, adopted child or grandchild, nnd
$5,000 for others.
It is said. In Washington that while
President Coolldge strongly disap
proves of the changes in the hill made
by the senate, he Is not likely to veto
It He hopes some of the objectionable
features will be removed In confer
ence, especially the corporation tax
substitute and the amendment provid
ing for full publicity of tax returns.
SENATE and house conferees on the
Immigration bill agreed upon the
feature providing complete exclusion
of Japanese Immigration after July 1
next, and then, yielding to the earnest
arguments of President Coolldge.
changed their minds and decided to
recommend postponement of exclusion
until March 1, 1925. This would give
the fttate department time to negotiate
with Japan for exeluslon by treaty,
which would mollify the cltlsens of
the Island empire considerably The
provision for exclusion as agreed on
Is lo the following language:
’This subdivision ■hall not lake *f
fort as to eiriushm until March 1.
IMft, before which (line the President
THE FIERY CROSS
is requested to negotiate with (Jie Jap
anese government in relation to the
abrogation of the present agreement
on this subject.”
Senator Shortrldge of California de
clared his intention of raising a point
of order against the conference report
when it comes to the senate on the
ground that the senate conferees
had exceeded their authority.
OENATOR NORRIS’ expressed inten-
tlon of continlng his efforts to
save Muscle Shoals and other valuable
resources of the country for the peo
ple will win wide approval, but It
isn’t likely he Is doing the cause any
good by his vicious attacks on Presi
dent Coolldge in that connection. The
senate ngrlculture committee heard
Jumes Martin Miller, correspondent,
declare again that he correctly quoted
the President, In his telegram to
Ford’s secretary, as saying he was
"trying to deliver" the Muscle Shoals
project to Ford —which Mr. Coolldge
has specifically denied. Norris tfien
said some very nasty things about the
Chief Executive.
"PRESIDENT COOLIDGE vetoed the
Bursum bill Increasing the pen
sions of veterans and widows of the
Civil war, on the ground of economy,
but it Is asserted it will be repassed
by both houses. Secretary Melton Is
said to have recommended that the
President veto the soldiers’ bonus
measure.
SENATOR COUZENS and Governor
Pinchot gained a big point In their
fight on Secretary Mellon when the
senate passed the Jones resolution em
powering its committee to go ahead
with paid counsel in the Investigation
of Mellon nnd the bureau of internal
revenue. Presumably Francis J. Heney
will get the Job, und the Inquiry will
he broadened to include the conduct of
the bureau in prohibition enforcement.
Operations of the Department of
Justice In connection with liquor
cases In Chicago were detailed to the
Daugherty committee. These Included
the notorious Grommes A Ullrich
liquor "split” and more about the con
viction and pardon of Grossman. For
mer Judge Landis had testified vigor
ously concerning the Grossman mat
ter, and last week C. W. MlddlekaufT,
assistant attorney general, appeared
before the committee and said Landis
had told iles. This may develop Inter
estingly later.
CALIFORNIA Republicans In their
primary election deserted Hiram
Johnson and gave their preference to
Coolldge by a majority of something
like 50,000. Johnson bore up under the
blow bravely, declaring the result was
not a tragedy. In the Democratic
primaries McAdoo ran against an un
instructed slate and won an impressive
victory.
Indiana Republicans also decided
for Coolldge as against Johnson by a
huge majority. The chief interest
there was in the race of Eld Jackson
for the gubernatorial nomination. He
was backed by the Ku Klux Klan and
obtained a clear majority over all his
five opponents combined. The Demo
crats were solid for Ralston, and Dr.
Carieton McCulloch was in the lead
for the gubernatorial nomination.
Mr. Coolldge has now defeated Sen
ator Johnson In all the direct primary
states except South Dakota, and vet
eran politicians believe the Californian
Is eliminated for all time as a Presi
dential possibility. The President and
his close advisers are now formulating
s platform for presentation to the
Cleveland convention, devoting them
selves at present especially to planks
dealing with International matters. Ac
cording to one veracious correspondent
the tentative program embodies these
features:
1. The United Htutes ahall Join the
World court If It la divorced from the
League of Nntlona.
2. The court ahall he maintained In
connection with The Hague tribunal,
aa originally advocated by the United
St a tea.
8. An International conference on
land and further naval armament llml
tatlon ahull he called by President
Coolldge, contingent upon the uccept
anca of the Dawes reparation* aet I le
nient by the Knropean powers.
Hennfor Lodge, In a resolution In
trodwed In the senate, has pmpoaed
that Ilia President he asked to call •
third Hague conference of all nations
for the purpose of divorcing the world
court from the longue of Nations, and
that the United States Join the court
on that condition.
EARLY a dozen political partiea
or groups were active In the re
cent elections In Germany, and the re
sults are that in the next reichstag
certain groups favoring the acceptance
of the Dawes committee report prob
ably will be able to combine and con
trol the vote of that body. Their
majority, however, will not be large,
and unless some of the groups change
their views, the necessary two-thirds
vote cannot be mustered for a change
of the constitution so that the Dawes
railroad plan can be accepted. The
Nationalists claim 105 seats In the
reichstag, making them the largest
single party, and they assert the gov
ernment of Chancellor Marx must re
sign and the chancellorship must be
given a Nationalist. The Communists
will play u big pnrt In German poli
tics, for they polled almost four mil
lion votes and have 60 members in the
reichstag. They have revived their
threat of a Red revolution and already
have Incited numerous strikes, both In
the Ruhr and In unoccupied Germany.
The Nationalists are said to be com
bining with the People’s party and
with some of the Catholics, Fascists
and Bavarian People’s party members
to form a monarchist bloc with a total
of 234 votes, which is a majority. It
Is believed this bloc will gradually
work toward a restoration of the mon
archy. Its success depends on the
stand taken by the Catholics, who may
prefer a coalition with the Socialists.
GERMAN police not long ago raided
the Berlin office of the soviet Rus
sian commercial delegation in search
for some suspect, and seized a lot of
documents. Russia protested strongly
against what It asserted was a viola
tion of her extraterritorial rights and
demanded satisfaction, which Berlin re
fused to grant. All trade relations be
tween the two countries were suspend
ed and Krestlnsky, soviet ambassador,
was summoned to Moscow.
As was predicted some time ago, the
negotiations In London between the
British and Russian government are
not getting along well. The soviet del
egates presented an extraordinary list
of damage claims to offset the old
debts to the British. If allowed, they
would leave Britain largely in the debt
of Russia. But there is no chance
that the English will allow’ them.
ARGENTINA’S extraordinary old
age pension law will be enforced
with great difficulty. Both employers
and workers are lighting It and last
week there was a combined strike and
lockout throughout the country. The
workers refuse to pay their part of
the pension fund, and the employers
refuse to collect from their employees.
However, the government is deter
mined and the opposition Is gradually
weakening, and the federation of labor
ordered the strike discontinued.
/"'OAST guard cutters, trappers, flsh-
ermen and Indians are continuing
the search for Major Martin and Ser
geant Harvey, the lost aviators of the
army’s globe-circling squadron, and an
offer of reward has spurred the Aleu
tian islanders to renewed effort. Vari
ous reports Indicated that the missing
plane flew to the north coast of the
Islands. The other three planes of the
squadron proceeded to Atka island
and were awaiting favorable weather
for the flight to Attu island aad thence
to Japan.
THE general conference of the Meth
odist Episcopal church in Spring
field. Mass., hy a vote of 802 to 13. ac
cepted in full the plan of unification
with the Methodist Eplacopul Church
South. The union cannot be formally
consummated for two years, but appal*
ently the breach which has existed
since 1844 Is now healed. The bishops
of the Church South will vote for the
unification and the question will then

OTTUMWA, IA„ May 10.—The
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Wa
pello county held their first outdoor
Klonklave of the season last Wednes

the organization were gathered for
the ceremonies. An electrically light
ed fiery cross was erected in the cen
ter of the Klavern. A class of candi
dates was initiated.

marked the entrance to the field,
through which only members and
identified candidates cvuld pass.
Returning from a call to Kirk
ville, Sheriff Henry C. Richards, Con
stable D. S. Bonwell and Prohibition
officer George Giltner were surprised
to come upon the meeting. They
questioned the outer guard as to the
nature of the affair and passed on.
The officers estimated that there
were at least 300 machines parked on
the field of the meeting. One of
them described the robed Kiansmen,
when asked as to the number of them,
as a “white seething mass.”
