grees maintained for half an honr is,
sufficient to destroy any germs likely
to be present in the milk and it is
found in practice that raining. the
e temperature to 155 degrees and then
i- allowing it to stand in the heated
n water for half an hour insures the
proper temperature for the required
r time. The temperature should not be
y raised above 155 degrees, otherwise the
c taste and quality of the milk will be
e impaired.
p The simplest plan is to take a tin
I pail and invert a perforated tin pie
plate in the bottom, or have made for
it a removable false bottom perforated
a with holes and having legs half an
1 inch high, to allow circulation of the
water. The milk-bottle is set on this
false bottom, and sufficient water is
put into the pail to reach the level of
the surface of the milk in the bottle.
1 A hole may be punched in the cover of
e the pail, a cork inserted, and a chem
ical thermometer put through the cork,
so that the bulb dips into the water.
The temperature can thus be watched
without removing the cover. If pre
ferred an ordinary dairy thermometer
may be used and the temperature test
a ed from time to time by removing the
lid. This is very easily arranged, and
is just as satisfactory as the patented 1
apparatus sold for the same purpose.

Stlaking Them Attractive Pays in Mare
rWays Thian One.
"The moderate outlay in making the
premises attractive brings profitable
returns by enhancing the value of the
I property, and in that way without tak
ing into consideration the refining in
fluences upon the occupants. will prove
a profitable investment. But a really
attractive home is not made so by lar
ishness in a few matters to the exclu
sion of others. Neatness and a home
like appearance, without too much dis
play, will produoe in a majority of
cases a more pleasing effect than a
larger and less tasty display. On the
farm where at times the work is so
pressing as not to permit of all that is
necessary to be done at the proper
season, a good variety of evergreens,
hardy shrubs and roses will give better
satisfaction than a large number or as
sortment of flowers neglected. Not 1
that flowers should be discarded. A
few well-made.flower-beds can be made
to add materially to the appearance of
the yard, but a number of neglected
plants and beds can hardly be consid- a
ered ornamental.
A well-seeded lawn with shrubs.
roses, evergreen and shade trees can be
secured at comparatively a nominal
cost and will not require a great t
amount of work to keep in good shape.
As with much other work, in nearly
all cases much better results can be-se- a
cured if time is taken in good season 1;
to carefully plant out the grounds.
It is impossible to give anything like n
minute directions for laying out and d
planting farmyards. Location of the
buildings must, in a great measure, de
termnine how the work can best be done. Ii
Generally it is best not to have so large d
a number as to over-plant
One common fault in planting is in
over-crowding. This often does not d
show at first, but a very few years' a
growth will show the effect. While
the variety should be made one part of
the plan, yet this, too, can readily be
overdone. Better a few choice varieties 1
than an indiscriminate mi-.gling of a
large number. This applies to shade b
and ornamental trees as well as to tl
shrubs and flowers.-Prairie Farmer. n

About the ~VWashingl o Butter.
There is a good deal of dispute re
garding the propriety of washing but
ter. A lump of butter entirely made a
of unbroken globules can be freed I
from sugar and casein by washing.
Water easily penetrates into the granu
lar, ungreasy mass; the ferraentative t
agents are removed; the butter will not
spoil. T'his does not happen after hard
churning, because churns break the
globules more or less by heat friction
or stroke. When a broken globule
sheds its contents, the butter, being a
minutely divided in a liquid state, ab- I
sorbs or combines with atoms of sugar
and casein which are in solution, and
therefore minutely distributed. No 'J
washing is able to disintegrate atomic t
agglomerations within a greasy sub
stance; wvater runs off from it; in such
a case carrying away coarse mem
branes and flavor of the butter. -Farm

Are'tell-tale symptoms that your blood is not right-full of im
purities, causing a sluggish and unsightly complexion. A few.i
bottles of S. S. S. will remove all foreign and impure matter,
cleanse the blood thoroughly and give a clear and rosy com
plexion. It is most effectual, and entirely harmless.

my face is all clear and smooth as it should be--ppesit,
splendid, sleep well and feel like running a foot race, all
from the use of S. S. S.
