SHREVEPORT'S REPRESENTI
TIVES IN NEW YORK CITY.
Winning Success and Honor in The
Respective Professions.-Per
sonal Mention.
New work, March 31. 1903.-Of tI
many thousands who come to Ne
York every year, hoping to win recol
nition. only a very few succeed in gail
ing more than a passing notice, ther
fore, it is with special pride and plea
tire that we see Shreveport's daughter
in the front ranks of the successfu
Very flattering indeed has been tF
success of Mrs. Adah Hlollingswortl
Watkins, who has charmed the ms
critical New York audiences with ht
gift of song. She gr:lduated frmni th
New England Cons ervatorv of Muisi
with honer, and later won the medal if
vocalization at the New York Shils
of Ope ra and Oratorio. She has do
clined many offers to go on the stagi
At the recent banquet of the Confed
crate Veterans, she was (specially lion
,red in being the singer chosen for th
occasion, and receiving a larigi remun
eration--an honor the more noteworthi
because the best singers volunieer thei
services for the privilege of appearint
before such a distinguished body. Mrs
Watkins has been induced to make
tour of the principal Western any
Southern cities during which she wil
give her great New York success
"Three Centuries of American Ballads.'
We are glad to say that Shreveport wil
have an opportunity of hearing thi
matchless singer in this unique and de
lightftil program.
Several Shreveport women. realizing
the advantages that are offered nowhere
but in New York. and being ambitiotu
to perfect themselves in their chosen
professions, are studying at the great
schools under the masters. One whc
promises to win success before the foot
lights is Miss Cardline N. Newman, a
student at the American College of
Dramatic Art. Those acquainted with
Miss Newman's achieve m .nt in athfe.

M iss . Lewis Cram promises to win
laurels as a pianist. Sly is studying at
the New York Collge of Music. Charm
mg in manner, possessing decided taktlt
supplemented by thorough training, diA
will, no doubt, become one of Shreve.
port's best musicians.
Mrs. Alice G. Dale, a graduate from
the New York School of Expression,
has chasen the platform as her field of
endeavor. Before receiving the finish
ing touches in New York she studied
under S. H. Clark of the Unieruity of
Chicago and other prominent -teachers,
and game readings with success in tmany
parts of the United States. Since com
ing to New 'ork Mrs. Dale's dramatic
ability has been recognized by eminent
critics. Receqtly her picture and a very
favorable criticism of her work ap
peared in Leslie's Weekly.
Miss Lucille Pitts Jocelyn is another
Shreveport woman who has won suc
cess in New York. She has held posi
tions in the choirs of the leading
churches here-notably Dr. McArthur's
and Dr. Parkhurst's. While prima don
na with Sousa's band she was urged to
take the European tour with the band
and sing before King Edward. Mrs.
Jocelyn feels that her first duty is to
her family and declined this and other
flattering offers.
Miss Lucia Mjore's ability, determi
nation and pluck have placed her among
the popular leading actresses of the
American stage. She has played with
Keene, Whiteside, Ward and Dowling.
She is at. present leading lady at the
Hopkins Stock Company, Memphis.
Previous to her engagement there she
was leading lady with the Baldwin
Melville Stock Company of New Or
leans. The Commercial Appeal in a re
cent criticism of this charming lady
said:' "The production is a signal event
in the artistic career of Miss Lucia
Moore. Her triumpJ yesterday in the
role of Neell Gwynn was full and com
plete. Again she 'showed to what heights
her art may lead, and the full develop
ment of her artistic judgment. Her
performance is abundant in its rounded
and beautiful touches."
Her son, Argyle Campbell, has inher
ited her histrionic talent. Although quite
young he has done creditable work on
the stage. Miss Moore claims New
York as her home and spends her vaca
tions here with her mother.

the Mayor and City Council: We your
claim committee, to whom was referred
the claim of Epple & Hayes against the
city for $2,339.96, beg leave to report
as follows:
That we are of the opinion that the
city is not indebted to the claimants and
therefore recommend that the account
be rejected, for the following reasons:
First-That the records of the city
show that a final settlement for the
work on which the claim is based has
been made and accepted by Eoole &
Hayes.
Second-That Mr. Epple himself tes
tified before the committee that the
grade of Donovan street is other than
the grade adopted by the council.
Third-That the contractors changed
the grade and constructed the street
according to stakes furnished by the
then City Engineer Frank W. Kane,
knowing at the time that the grade wits
not the one adopted by the council.

asked by Ex-Mayor Ben Holzman if
he (Epple) was authorized by the
During the examination Mr. Epple
exhibited a cross-section sheet on
which he stated he based his claim. Mr.
Epple acknowledged that he had se
cured this cross-section sheet from for
mer City Engineer Kane after the lat

Mr. C. B. Johnson, former chairman
of the improvement committee, stated
that he had often heard Mr. Epple say
to former City Engineer Kane that he
(Epple) thought Kane was figuring too
close. This. Mr. Johnson stated, Mr.
Kane denied. Mr. Johnson also stated
that he was of the opinion that the
Donovan street and streets contiguous
matter was settled by the acceptance by
Epple & Hayes of Mr. Kane's final es
timate.
For these and other reasons we re
commend that the claim in question be
rejected. Respectfully.
