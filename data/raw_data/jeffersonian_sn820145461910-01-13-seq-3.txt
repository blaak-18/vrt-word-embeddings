Resolutions of Rankin Local Un
ion No. 447, Montgomery
County, Lilac, Miss., January
1, 1910
1. Resolved, That we deem it to
be the indispensable duty of our Na
tional President, Chas. L. Barrett, to
investigate the charges denounced
against President J. L. Lee, of Union
City, Ga., and also against Messrs.
Duckworth, Ladson, and Boden
hamer, by the Hon. T. E. Watson,
mentioned in The Jeffersonian De
cember 9th, pages 9 and 13, also
December 23, page 1.
2. Resolved further, That we ex
pect, and insist, that President Bar
rett appoint a committee to investi
gate such charges denounced by Mr.
Watson.
3. Resolved further, That we un
qualifiedly condemn and denounce
the action of the Galveston Conven
tion in its passage of a resolution
favoring the Merchant Marine.
4. Resolved further, That this
Merchant Marine is nothing more
nor less than the Ship Subsidy steal.
And, whereas, we deem it wise and
prudent that said charges should be
met and answered in the open, in
stead of the private letter and secret
meeting policy, and thereby give Mr.
Watson a fair fight; and whereas,
such a policy as mentioned above is
both cowardly and unfair to Mr.
Watson and the Union people;
5. Resolved further, That we call
upon every local union throughout
the State of Mississippi to take up
this matter and demand an open and
fair investigation of those charges
made by the Hon. Thomas E. Wat
son.
6. Resolved further, That we do
unqualifiedly endorse the resolutions
passed by the Fellowship Local
Union, No. 1142, of Hart county, Ga.,
mentioned in The Jeffersonian of
December 23d, page 15.
7. Resolved further, That a copy
of these resolutions be sent to The
Mississippi Union Advocate and The
Jeffersonian, Thomson, Ga.
Unanimously adopted.
J. H. POWELL, Pres.
S. W. CLARK, Sec.
P. S. —I carried a copy of the
above resolutions out to our Union
meeting, and they were unanimously
adopted, which I shall send on to
our Mississippi Union Advocate, and
I was authorized to make a copy and
sign it up and send on to you for
publication. We don’t particularly
wish to help you to fight this matter,
but simply we want to see you get a
fair show and a fair fight. We be
lieve that you are plenty able to take
care of yourself if given a fair
chance, and that it is the duty of
President Barrett to have this mat
ter investigated, and we are very
willing to help you along that line.
You have twice called upon President
Barrett for an open investigation,
but it seems that he is very reluc
tant about taking hold of the mat
ter. Well, he had better do it, or
something will happen.
J. H. ROWELL.
Union No. 2077 Speaks
Whereas, the editor of The Jeffer
sonian has made, and continues to
make, charges against Messrs. Duck
worth, Ladson and Bodenhamer,
which charges they have refused to
publicly either admit or deny; there
fore be, it
Resolved by our Local Union, No.
2077, of Oglethorpe county, Georgia,
That we denounce the whole of the
Galveston resolution relative to the
so-called Merchant Marine as a snare
and a fraud, and ask of Mr. Duck-
worth to inform the public whether
or not he was paid for the space in
the Union News devoted to the ad
vocacy of the said Merchant Marine,
and if so by whom.
Resolved further, That we con
sider Mr. Duckworth’s methods of
avoiding publicity in answering the
aforesaid published charges as ex
tremely cowardly.
Resolved further, That we are op
posed to the employment of a legal
counsellor for the Farmers’ Union
whose reputation for honesty and up
rightness is not above reproach.
Resolved further, That we de
mand that President John Lee an
swer publicly the questions put to
him by Hon. T. E. Watson in The
Jeffersonian of December 9, 1909, on
pages nine and thirteen.
Resolved further, That we ask
President Barrett to appoint a com
mittee to investigate the said charges
brought against Messrs. Duckworth,
Ladson and Bodenhamer, in their
interest as well as ours.
Resolved further, That these
resolutions be spread on our minutes
and a copy be sent to the Union
News, the Atlanta Constitution and
The Jeffersonian with a request that
they be published.
J. W. MIERE, President.
R. A. KENNEDY, Secretary.

Resolutions of Antioch Local
Union No. 1066
Resolved, That Antioch local
wants to be put on record as being
unanimously opposed to the resolu
tion passed by the Farmers’ State
Union of Texas at Galveston last Au
gust, passing what they were pleased
to call the Merchant Marine; in re
ality it is the Ship Subsidy steal.
Resolved, That we condemn this
arbitrary act assuming so much au
thority on such important legislation,
without giving any previous notice
to the rank and file of our member
ship. We deem it an outrage on the
good name of our order.
Resolved, That we ask the mem
bership of the Farmers’ Union,
throughout this grand old State of
Texas, to rise up as one man and
assert our rights to be heard on this
very important question, before we
try to get our Representatives in
Congress to commit themselves to
any such legislation.
Resolved, That these resolutions
be sent to the Co-operator and The
Jeffersonian for publication.
W. A. MARSH, President.
J. W. REYNOLDS, Secretary.
Copy of Letter Sent to Duck
worth’s Paper
Union News, Union City, Ga.
Dear Brothers: —As I have been a
strong union man ever since we
have had a Union, and expect to be
as long as I live, for I think lots of
the Union, but there are things
wrong, such as the way Hon. T. E.
Watson is being answered. His
charges should be answered through
the Union News.
Nothing else will ever do. If Mr.
Watson is wrong let them say so,
and* not have other people run
around and answer for them. That
will never do at all. I believe Mr.
Watson is the greatest reformer that
ever lived, and if'Messrs. Duckworth,
Ladson, and Bodenhamer are not
going to answer Mr. Watson’s
charges you may discontinue my
paper; I don’t care to read a paper
that will not defend itself in as bold
an attack as this.
There are lots of people in this
community that say you must meet
3tffersonlan
Watson in the open, or they are
done with the Union News.
As ever, a strong Watson Union
man,

Some Fine Florida Resolutions
Whereas, there is a probability
that the present Congress will have
brought before it a bill commonly
known as the Ship-Subsidy Bill,
which proposes to foster an Ameri
can merchant marine at the expense
of the people, and, ultimately, at the
expense of the farmers; therefore
be it
Resolved by Oxford Local No. 310,
of the Farmers’ Educational and Co
operative Union of America: (1)
That we oppose any and all
subsidies and special privileges en
joyed by the few, including the tariff
subsidy, which injured our merchant
marine and thereby created a de
mand for a ship-subsidy.
(2) We oppose, bitterly, the build
ing up of the business of a few citi
zens by a tax on the many, realizing
that ultimately the producer pays all
taxes.
(3) That a copy of these resolu
tions be sent to our two United States
Senators from Florida and to our
Representative from this district.
(4) That a copy of these resolu
tions be sent to the following papers
with a request for publication: Sum
ter County Times, The Ocala Star,
and Watson’s weekly Jeffersonian.
(5) That other Locals, especially
of our own county and State, be re
quested to pass similar resolutions.
Unanimously adopted by Oxford
Local, No. 310, F. E. and C. Union,
in regular session, December 10,
1909.
T. J. BAILEY, President.
J. L. PEMBERTON, Sec.-Treas.
Whereas, we have learned through
the efforts of the United States
Monetary League that there is a
prospect of the commission appoint
ed by the last Congress making radi
cal changes in our present mone
tary system, to wit: (1) The retire
ment and destruction of $346,000,-
000 of greenbacks now in circula
tion, and the substitution therefor
of bank currency. (2) The estab
lishment of a central bank for the
issue and control of this currency,
thereby placing the power of expan
sion and contraction more fully in
the hands of the banks than at pres
ent; therefore, be it
Resolved by Oxford Local No. 310,
of the Farmers’ Co-operative and
Educational Union of America, (1)
That we oppose the above enu
merated changes in our monetary
system, or any other change which
will place the money of the country
more completely under the control
of the banks.
(2) That we oppose the present
practice of the Government of dele
gating to any individual or corpora
tion the right to issue notes to pass
as money.
(3) That we advocate the annul
ling of the charters of the national
banks to the purpose and extent that
the notes of these banks, which now
circulate as money, shall be retired
from circulation and their place sup
plied by non-interest-bearing notes,
or greenbacks.
(4) That we advocate a return to
the original constitutional system of
finance, in which the Government
shall issue all of the money of the
country; and in which every dollar,
whether gold, silver, or greenbacks,
shall be a full legal tender for all
debts.
(5) That a copy of these resolu
tions be sent to the United States
Senators for Florida and our Repre
sentative from our district.
(6) That a copy of these resolu
tions be sent to the following papers,
with a request for publication: The
Sumter County Times, The Ocala
Weekly Star, and Watson’s weekly
Jeffersonian.
(7) That other union locals and
county unions, especially of our own
county and State, be requested to
take similar action.
Unanimously adopted by Oxford
Local No. 310, F. E. and C. Union, in
regular session, December 10, 1909.

WANTS TO ORGANIZE A CLUB.
Dear Sir:—Please send me all in
structions how to organize Jeffer
sonian Clubs. I believe there could
be one organized here and think it
would do a lot of work.
The people here as a rule are tired
of being promised big things and get
nothing in the way of reform, and I
think everything is ripe for reform
work.
You have many, many friends
here and about as many enemies.
But you are forcing all to see that
you are right, and a friend of the
masses.
Am glad you are exposing some
of the Farmers’ Union officials. It
seems strange that none of the mem
bers have the backbone to do as you
are doing. This exposure is going to
lead many to your side.
It seems to me that all reform
forces are losing time in not coming
together. Could you not lay a plan
to bring them in one body? If that
could be done there is no telling
what might be done by 1912.
Say, Mr. Watson, I learn that
Bryan has come out in favor of pro
hibition. Do you suppose he will
have it inserted in the next Demo
cratic platform?
I guess I am taking up too much
of your precious time and will not
say any more.
Wishing you Godspeed, I am yours
in the work of reform.

ASK YOUR NEIGHBOR.
No doubt many of your neighbors
have used Vitae-Ore on its thirty

State in the Union have tested it in
this way. Ask them what they know
about it, ask them how it cures.
