In spite of the exodus fever, late spring
cold weather and heavy rains, the far
mers bave conquered the graus, and the
cottesn crop promises a fruitful retaiurn
and the reports from all over the parish
are of the most favorable eharacter, No
wormn have made their appearance. The

donhtedly carry off the palm for the tlest
cotton, andl we venture to say that no
parish in the State will pr&lluce as manch.
Corn crop has suffered a great deal

This amateur troupe gave another en

and well selected audience. In the open
ing Bones and Tambo, with their origin
al "punls"on local issues brought down
the house. The rendition of the "Blak
Statue," with the following caste of char
acters: Sleuintem, anold farmer, by Ware i
Mr. 8qsintsnm. Noomnan ; Jake, a nlischiev
ous servant, Kile: Rose, old Squintuua's
daughter, Jerome Messi; Pete, Rose's
lover, J. E. Messi ; Pilgarlic, a sly cove,
Wright, was highly applauded by the
audience. These young men not only
surprised the audience in the manner
they carried themselvee through this
play, but it was to them a greater one on
account of the few rehearsals they had
taken. The songs were all of the latest
and good. The dancing by Vines was un
surpased, and in bis slight of hsad/busi
nes he was truly wonderful. Mir. J. F.
Pierson of Cushatta, was solicited by
the Home Ministrels to address the aundi.
ence, which that gentleman did in behalf
of the coalpany, in a few well timed and
brief remarks. .The entertainmeLt con
eluded with the laughable farce entitled
the "Stages Struck Darkey" and Meed,
Kile and Neoman, kept the house in a
continual roar of laughter, from the title
the enrtain went up until it was.dropped,
and everybody went home happy.

I eux preparatory to leaving had the sev
en convicted prisoners brought out on
the side-walk that they might talk with
their friends before taking their depar

, the least, for the prisoners. Of course a
large crowd of the colored citizens con
gregated in front of the gate to bid fare
well to their colored friendsfsho had been
designated by the court es At delegatee
r to the penitentiary. An aged mother's
grief over a sinful son, was a sad scene
witrnesed by the bystacders. Some of
the prisoners seemed to be contented '
with the verdict of the court; they I
warned their colored friends to take ex- t
ample from them, lead a good life in the s
future, and became good citizens. One ,
prisoner remarked that the verdict
against him was wrong, be was innocent
of the charge, and the Lord knew it,
when one of the prisoners replied, "old
man, you should have bhad the Lord sam
moned in your ease and thejury would a
have acquitted you " The prisoners af I
