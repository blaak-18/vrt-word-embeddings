THE IXUtfDATIOlY.
ITS EXTENT AHD ITS CONSEQUENCES.
We give in this week's Picayune a
view of the overflowed districts along
the Mississippi, situated in the three
States of Louisiana, Mississippi and
Arkansas. This map can tell ranch
of the story of the suffering, want
and ruin this unexpected flood has
produced far better than we. Yet,
even the map conveys not the whole
truth of the misery in this State to a
stranger. It only appears that a
quarter of Louisiana and a large por
tion of Arkansas and Mississippi are
under water ; they know not that
the parishes Under water contain
two-thirds of the wealth, the popu
lation, the industry and the produce
of the State.
Of the fifty-three parisheg of the
State, thirty-one are partially or en
tirely covered by the inundation :
Morehouse, Carroll, Madison, Frank
lin, Ouachita, Union, Richland, Cald
well, Tensas-, Catahoula, Ooncordia,
Avoyelles, Pointe Coupee, St. Landry,
West Baton Iiouge, Iberville, As
sumption, Ascension, St. Martin, St.
Mary, St. James, St. John, the
Baptist, St. Charles, Terrebonne, La
fourche, St. Bernard, Plaquemines,
St. Helena, East Feliciana, Living
ston and St. o Tammany. These
parishes contain about 375,000 peo
ple—one-half of the whole popula
tion, and seven-twelfths of the agri
cultural, laboring or prcducingpopu
latiou of the State—upon whom not,
only New Orleans is dependent, but
also the Northland Europo itself for
clothing and supplies.
The lands overflowed are calcula
ted at about 2,300,000 acres, about
one -fourth of which was under culti
Tation in corn, cotton and sugar
when the flood began. ® * *
Looking at jhe various sections
thus afflicted, we'find first the Yazoo
Valley. Hero the Mississippi lias
broken throughout Hushpakana and
Bolivar, or,j transformed the whole
Yazoo Valley into an inlan lake.
Along the Amite, from its source
in-Mississippi to Lake Pontchartrain,
the lowlands .are all under water
washing out a poor but. industrious
class of people, almost all white.
The Pearl River overflow is more
of a freshet than a flood ; the rains
alone are answerable for it. The
bridges between New Orleans and
the North have been washed away,
and the saw mills g.long that stream,
that supplied New Orleans and the
Southwest with lumber, have suffer:
ed a great deal. s
In Arkansas, although the Chicot
and St. Fancis crevasses cover some
1,000,000 acres, yet they havu not
caused such loss as in other parts of
the country, as, for instance, the
Ouachita and Block river bottoms.
Here the condition is most frightfully
appalling, with little chance of re
lief for months to come. For over
two hundred miles the Ouachita has
spread out its stream to from ten to
fifty mile» wide. When th0 inhabi
tants fled to. the back lands with
their property, they encountered the
waters flowing from the Mississippi
crevasses. Thus between two floods,
their only refuge was the housetops,
where they are now living, having
lost their cattle, their clothing, even
their power to work.
The four great cotton parishes ot
Madison, Tensas, Concordia and Car
roll are filled by quite a number of
crevasses at Bass, quarter of a mile
wide, Point Lookout, Hard Times,
Buck Ridge, Glasscock, half a mile
wide ; all of them averaging seven
feet ill depth, and opening the coun
try to an artificial river two miles-in
width.
Just below the month of Red River
occur the two most murderous cre
vasses in the 9 State, the Morganza
and H'ckey.- The Morganza, nearly
a mile wide, running at the rate of
three.and a half miles an hour ; the
H.ickey, a third of a mile in width,
ten feet deep, and pouring in at the
rate of nine and half miles an hour.
After cpvering the river front par
ishes of Poii'c Coupee, West Baton
Rouge and Iberville, the w^tcr from
the Crevasses swelled the Atchfalaya,
Lafourcho and Techo to such a
volume as th overflow every parish
on its course to*the sea, St. Landry,
Lafourche, m Lafayette, Terrebonne,
St. Mary, and others. Hero the
w aters deal double destruction, over
flowing the richest alluvial country
in the worK, and destroying one
third of the sugar crop of the State.
Back of the banks dwell the small
settlers, Cadiens, and others, who are
dependent on their hunting, and the
products of their fields and their cat
tle for support from ^lay to day.
Several lives have been lost here
those who remain are cryihg foi
food and clothing. °
Below New Orleans, in Plaque
mines, almost the whole country has
been inundated. :
To sum up the flood from Mem
phis to the Passes, the crevasses are
over fifty miies in width. Through
them flow streams greater and more
powerful than the mighty Mississippi
itself, and which pour out on this de
voted country 2,000,000,000 cubic
feet of water every hour. Not ouly
is this water thrown on the land,
bat it mu&t find its way to the sea
through six hundred miles of low
ajluvial lands. It is not hyperbole,
then, to say that the Misossippi is
wider now than the far-famed Ama
zon, whose mouth is two hundred
and fifty miles in width.
The loss to the crops has been cal
culated as follows : Cotton, 300,000
bales ; sugar, 40,000 hogsheads, and
almost a total destruction of the
tobacco and rice crops, Q the last, one
of the most promising and ever in
crea ing industries of Louisiana.—

DECISION OF THE POPE.
THE ST. LOUIS GLOBE of the 10th
ult., ' makes the following impor
tant announcement:
Roman Catholic farmers desirous of
joining the order of the patrons of
husbandry, have hitherto bad in their
way the laws of their church, forbid
ding its members to identify them
selves with secret societies. Of onr
American prelates we believe that
Archbishop Alemanryyof San- Fran
cisco, has held that the Catholic far
mer. will do well to ere On the side of
safety, and so not join the grange un
til the Pope has evpressed his approv
al of its objects, while other Bishops
have forbidden, members of their flocks
from becoming patrons upon any con
sideration.
The matter has been finally ,adjudi
cated on by Pions IX, aB appears by
the Norisk Volkeblad, the Scandinari
an organ of Minnesota.
A Catholic member of the State Leg
islature was désirons of joining the
grange, but had conscientious sciuples
about doing so, arising from His reli
. gious belief.
1-Ie consulted Father Ireland, of St.
Paul, who referred him to Bishop
Grace. Both- these clergymen ex
pressed themselves as possessing a fa
vorable impression of the principles,
objects, and methods ot the>grange, but
neither of them could break though th»
absolute rule of the church, and they
reco'i,mended the legislator to appeal
to Rome. • o
lie accordingly laid the matter be
fore the Pope,-to whom he transmitted
at the same time lull particulars as to
the objects contemplated by the order,
and the means by- which it was pro
posed to attain them.
A reply I ns been received from hia
Holiness, stating that the Pope allows
the petition to join the Grange of
Pations of Husbandry, and lie a mem
her thereof, if he find nothing therein
conflict with his conscience, or tho
creed of the Catholic Church.
As a congregation, the order has
received a large accession in Minneso
ta, and when the news of tho Pope's
decision has reached other States, its
eö'ects will be largely to increase the
numbers of the patrons, and to femovo
the interdict laid upon Catholics dé
sirions of becoming such, by prelates,
who have disapproved of the Grange,
and been doubtful as the consistency
of its obligations with those of the
Church.
