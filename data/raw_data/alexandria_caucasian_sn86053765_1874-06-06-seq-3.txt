Taxation and Confiscation in th@ Par*
ish of Natchitoches.
Tbo Republican of that Parish, iu a-rc
plj? to onr comments lipon Mr. JSIacksfemo
«s an unswerving Republican, bad taken
up tbo defense of tbo Republican party in
that Parish on the subject of taxation, and
rejoices in an opportunity to fix tbo res
ponsibility wlicro it belongs. We hoped
when wo saw this profession, that it was
sincere, and as our information vas only
of a general character, that wo bad per
haps overstated the iniquities of what Jt
termed unswerving republicanism. lint
Boino ono has sent us a mass of statist ics
which shows, that the half had not been
told; that the article of the Republican was
not only not candid, but was merely tbo
plea of not guilty, by tbo conscious crimi
nal, who relies not on his inuoccnco, but
on tbo hope that the- testimony to prove
Iiis guilt, cannot be produced. If it In
tended to expose the truth, why in answer
to our charge of the Police Jury issuing
$5000 for a map and- $3000 for an Emmi
gration bureau, did it deny that, the war
rants issued as alleged— without giving
the reason, why they did not jssue. What
will the world think of the police jury,
and the candor of its defender when we in-'
form it, that the reason the warrants did
not issue was because their issuing was en
joined at tbo suit of a taxpayer? Wo have
not room to point out theother equally
iiucandid denials and special pleadings of
the Republican. Wo liopo it will in fu
ture coino up to its professions and expose
all, whether Republican or Democrat, who
^ire parU'crpsxrimiiiis in tbo nefarious taxa
tion of Natchitoches." fiinco writing our
obituary notice of Mr. Blackstono, soin?
one lias sent us" a tax notice, which we
presume is stich n*i nro current in that
Parish; exhibiting the following onormoue
taxation for 187;»:—Stato tax I ii mills;
Special parish tax 40 m ills; Parish 20 mills;
Parish 2 mills; School tax mills; equal
to 71) mills on the dollar. Even a Louisi
ana Republican official paper, must have
in its editor feonie of that metal, out of
which brass candlesticks are made, to un
dertake tho defense of such taxation as
this. -I'ut this tax notice, is but the out
cropping of a fathomless mine of polit ical
iniquity. To pay judgments rendered, on
parish paper issued by tho police jury the
following amounts wcro collected and
paid. In 18G9 $25,778,00: in 1870, $13,104,
00; in 1871, $20,608,00 and tli'e Republican
informs us that, there is still $60,000.00 un
paid; 1 ho tax collector says $06,1711,00. I îtî -
%ides all this paper which is now merged
in judgments thero was collected in 1869,
$18 ,365,00; in 1870 $22,805,00; iu 1871 $11
062,00 and a floating debt of about $5(JO0
outside of the judgments, still unpaid, mak
in>r an aggregate expenditure or rather
robbery, in three years of 16 510; not in
eluding licenses which would be about
$8000 more. Tbo enormity of this taxation
is only exceeded by (be iniquity whioh
produced it. No Asiatic despotism of mod
urnffltimes, tells such a story of public plun
der. Even Verres the loyal representa
tive of another Republic and whose rub.
beries have rendered his name immortal,
has not excelled these "modern types nf
Republicanism. It was in vain that the
vict im of Verres cried out, "1 am :i Kornau
oiti/<jn," and it has been equally m vain
that the white people of Natchitoches, Ihr
representatives of ils wcallli, ils i telli
gcnco and its morals; cry out, 'we arc
American citizens. Our ancestors poured
out their blood, and offered up their lives
hi defense of American independence."
The sable goddess oi Africa ijiji^t be wor
shipped. and no offering at lier shrine, is so
sweet, as fho spoils of the White man's
properly and tho white man's liberties.
The carpet-bagger and Scallawag, are her
ministering priest fo procure and prepare
ihe sacrifice. No portion of ihe Anglo
Saxon race, as for as wo aro informed, ever
submitted to such taxation before. Charles
I lost his bead for attempting to enfonce a
tax not half as high, and just as legal, and
the world has applauded and honored as
heroes the men who dared to resist it
Hut what was tho divine right of Kings,
to levy illegal taxes, compared fo fbe di
vine right of the negro and crrpet-bagger
to plunder the white peoplo of fho South.
It seems to us that wheii the people of
Nat chitoches, in the midst of this cou fis- j
rät ion; for it is nothing less;^»"template j
have plundered them, they must, grow |
frantic with madness. Holland and Zea

cv. r .-be could form a plan-able . ncu ^ i
for issuing paper. The amoiint of the
yearly taxes paid in this paper was com
mitted to the very police juries who bad
Issued it, tor be canceled. Was it ever
cancelled? bliese Police Juries were ig
norant negroes who could not- do a sum
in simple addition ami subtraction,, but
then they were unde.i the care and guard
ianship of those pure patriots who never
dreamed of guile; the manipulators who
had presided over • its manufactory. Was
it cancelled ? That's the question. " •
15ut the Republican charges that the
judgments on this paper belong to Demo
crats. But where was the President of tho
police jury when these judgments were
obtained. Tho Republican lias as much
authority to issue Parish paper as the po
lice jury had. If defended, no judgments
could have been obtained. It is probable,
that I ho president of the police jury conbl
even yet have tliem annulled. Why were
the suits not defended 1 Why were no ap
peals taken 1 Why are no suits brought
to annul them? Or why did not the po
lice jury and its president, Mr. Hlackstone,
refuse to make an assessment, and test the
validity of the entire number of judgments
when a rule was taken tocompol tho Jury,
to make tho assessment for the pfl'ymentof
those j udgnicnts ? If tbo Police* Jury had
desired to prevent tins speculation and
robbery, it would have been easy enough
to have found ways and means to have
prevented it. But such a courso would
havo marrejl tho symetry of tbo entire
plan. But it democrats are implicated in
tbo issuing of this paper, that in no man
ner lessens its iniquity. Democracy, no
more released one from bis obligations of
integrity than Republicanism does. It
makes no difference to the poor whether
plundered by Democrats or Republicans.
But the asüftion of the Republican is
disengenions. These judgments, many of
them are in the name of other parties, than
the real owners and at'least three fourths
of their amount are owned by less than
half a dozen individuals and perhaps two
thirds of tho paper on which they are rcn
tiered, passed through the hands of less
than three,-who got value received for it.
,, r - ... , . .
u e can readily comprehend now a ring bv
.? •
havinji this paper issued, and buvintr it ni»
T , ' ,, r
and placjng it in Judgment would force
• , , „ , , ,
every man who bad means or who bad
taken parish paper, to place his in Jni!;;-!
monts for self protection. But wo see
j
names in tbo. list of those Judgment •; of
gentlemen who have never lent themselves
to plundering the public and whom we are
sure would readily receive the cost and in
terest on their money paid for I heir paper.
if such an arrangement could bo made
with all the owners of these Judgments.
There is one ground of Justification of
the Police Jury in issuing Parish paper—|
urged by the Republican which wo deem
j if important, to notice, .viz - that they, wer«
authorized by.law. This is a very unsound
Irule. Things m.iy be lawful, which are
l not only not expedient, but even wicked
I and dishonest. For înslance the £o«*ern
i or -I ud two other officials are authorised to
contract with one paper in each parish, to
I p®Mi.0j the law i at 0® par square, «very
such contract costing th Sfafo from $1500
! fo -".'10. Thc.su papers after the laws hare
! been published in book form, get a copy—
and spend ihe Summer months in publish
...„ laws which are alreadv in the hands
L
very hotly who wants them, fan any
square, would fho Republican think it j
honest or right, to accept such a contract?;
Would it, not be apparent to every honest
man; that, such an net was intended to le-j
gal fee robbery and public, plunder ? Law j
cannot change the great law of right and j
wrong; it can never make that honest—|
which is dishonest—and is no justification j
of tho'Police Jury issuing $8000 for a<> bn-1
one who i.-t publishing tho lawsjindpr sncl 1
;i. contmct. lirlievo it honest or right? Tho!
Hili!«' in ri'gru'dort l,v nîost, mon ns it he I tor,
hook than the statutes pns^ocl hy tho no-j
çro logislatures since 18(>S. If the législa
ture had authorizcil ihe governor to con
tract with newflpriper^ throngliout, tin
Slate, for printing the hihle at Al 00 per
migration bureau, or $5000 for a Parish
map.
The Republican reads us a lecture on
the, maxim, vil, de inorluiif, tiisi, etc.
While wo recognise the full force of the
maxim,* wo deny its appl i<:abi!if.y to such
career as that of Mr. Hlackstone. Our
comments upon it is justified by an h an
precn7lo n t ,s. The friends of Caligula,
of Nero and Phillip II of Spain, and tho
thousands and tens of thousands of their

•Having read an article recently

ai d being impressed "with a favorable
opinion of your purpose to commend
to public favor all laudable enterpri
ses, we would respectfully,, submit, if
it will not interfere with other publi

in your enterprising Journal, this
correspondence, in the interest of the
Grangers. "Wo had Ihe pleasure of
being present at a.G range organiza
tion on Big Creek last week, con

gentleman Joseph Hynson, assisted
by your polite and affable Townman
Compton French. The necessity of
concerted action on the part of the
farmers to protect their interests
from the abuses of monopolies, and
corrupt legislation, has been to tliem
a .subject of long consideration.
But we wore never before so B<m
sibly impressed with the importance
of this agricultural movement, and
to one who entertains a common
sympathy for tho general welfare of
our people, "lis indeed a pleasure to
know and understand the «sound
n oral, charitable and humaniturian
principles advocated by the Patrons
of Husbandry. We were considera
bly amused, although not well
enough, to ehjoy a hearty laugh, at
some little pleasing incidents con
nected with tho routine of business,
and we presume others fine food
for mi j th, in Lodges more noted for
intellectual capacity. Taking it " all
iir nil" however, wo think wo dyl
tolerably well for "Pinewoods"
folks, and "what wo lack in merit, we
make up in numbers, for 'tis not to
bo denied that wo possess 'a -suffi
cient amount of good material, 0 with
which to build h Lodge of respecta

much, if not all the financial disabil

soon be considered as things of the
past. Suppose tho land holder \?err
to sell every alternate forty rares of
surplus land lie owns, on five or ten
years credit at a fair valuation, with
legal interest accruing, reserving for
himself und family a sufficiency in
block for general use, how long would
it take to cancel the mortgages and
other evidences of debt, by which so
many of tho most valuable pi ant a
tions are incumbered, saying nothing
of the enhanced value of tho unsold
lands which would undoubtedly fol

Tie subject ôf this notice-as a
young lady, endeared herself tqf our
community by tlio many and tin
tiring exertions in .the cause of
charity and religion, and. was al
ways among the very first to re
spond to the calls of either. Was
a subscription to be gotten up to
relieve the wants of any dependant
upon the charity of our citizens,
she was always ready to interest
herself iu tho matter, and always
succeeded. Was any lady neigh
bor, friend or stranger, sick an e d
lire pared tho little delicacies, to
please their tastes. Hid tho ladies
of her ckurch propose to have a
fair or entertainment of any kind
for the.benefit of the church, she
was one of the most active in the
preparations, one of tho most labo
rious in the/actual labor of tho un
dertaking; with a heart ever open
to the appeals of tho afflicted, and
a hand ever- prompt find ready to
assist tho necessitous, it followed of
a, necessity, that with a pure mind
ajand holy devotion, she was a de
ivouj;and conscientious christian, an
huinlde worshiper at the shrine of
that religion whose first and grand
est precept is charity.
As the wife for but a few, very
few years, of our esteemed and
most worthy friend and townsman,
James W. Osborn, she forgot none
of her former eharitabloinclinations,
