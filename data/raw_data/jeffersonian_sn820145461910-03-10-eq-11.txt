Sir Morton Frewen Enter
tained at Denver
The Denver News of recent date
reported the meeting in honor of Sir
Morton Frewen, the great English
economist, and his speech in part as
follows:
England, I believe, will within
the next eighteen months adopt
the Goschen plan to increase the
price of silver,” said Morton Frewen,
the English economist, last night to
a brilliant assembly of Denver busi
ness men at a six o’clock dinner in
the Albany Hotel.
When the distinguished speaker
had finished his address he was hon
ored with a rising vote of thanks by
the guests. The banquet was ar
ranged by the chamber of commerce
and the Real Estate Exchange to
give Moreton Frewen an opportunity
to discuss a plan for the remonetiza
tion of silver that has found favor
not only among silver men in the
West, but with many of the most
noted financiers in London and New
York. He fully outlined the plan
which has attracted world-wide at
tention and aroused enthusiasm.
The dinner was served in the con
vention hall of the Albany Hotel and
lasted until 7 o’clock, when the ci
gars were passed around and the
speaking began. President Bartlett,
of the Chamber of Commerce, spoke
briefly, requesting former Governor
C. S. Thomas to introduce the Eng
lish champion of the silver cause.
The ex-Governor referred to Frewen
as the leading authority of the world
on exchanges, and announced his
subject as “The Effect of the Demon
etization of Silver on International
Trade.”
In his introductory remarks the
economist stated that he was pleased
to see many of the younger genera
tion present.
“We may be on the threshold of
this question’s solution, but the solu
tion may be delayed many years,” he
said, “and in that case the young
men of today will be the ones to
settle a problem of such tremendous
importance to all the world.”
“I have come to see, in view of
what has happened in the last few
years, that this question is of vastly
more importance than we imagined
it to be during the agitation that
preceded the election of 1896 in this
country. We are only at the begin
ning of the inflation of prices. And
as prices rise in this country your
industries, if silver remains at low
ebb, will be swept into Asia.
“A year ago I met J. J. Hill in St.
Paul and he said: ‘Mr. Frewen, you
have studied the question of ex
change and I wish that you would
tell me why it is that since the fall
in silver I have had no freight for
my ships from this country to China.
I expected to put a sack of flour into
every Chinese home, but now my
ships go to the Orient empty. What
is the trouble?’
“I told Mr. Hill that the Chinese
merchant who had been buying in
this country the year before had
ceased to buy. The year before that
merchant had gone to his banker
and had bought $5 in gold exchange
for 5 1-2 taels. A year later he was
compelled to pay Staels for the $5
gold which he had used to buy goods
in this country. He ceased to pur
chase goods in the United States.
“Mr. Hill caught the idea quickly
and now is saying a word wherever
he can in favor of the Goschen plan.
Harriman was non-committal when I
saw him a year ago, but when I saw
him again last April he said that he
was a good silver man. He told me
he had visited China, and said he
had become convinced that Chinese
manufacturers paying cheap wages
in silver would soon be able to out
bid Americn manufacturers in the
markets of the world.
“The remedy we are now advo
cating for the conditions I have de
scribed was proposed by a royal com
mission of most distinguished and
able men in 1883. Lord Goschen,
when he became chancellor of the
exchecquer in 1891 approved the
plan, but since that time nothing has
been done to promote the plan. Lord
Goschen declared it perfectly feasi
ble, and said there was no economic
objection to it.
“We believe, however, that by
means of the Goschen plan we shall
be able to put much more silver into
circulation. It is proposed to issue
small non-legal tender notes secured
by silver. With these we can pay
the old-age pensions. Payment in
this way will have another great ad
vantage. This silver in the shilling
is now worth 4 cents and we shall be
able to pay a 60-shilling pension
with 20-penny notes.
“One of your national platforms
.might refer to our plan as a cowardly
make-shift, but we must walk before
we can run. If we can increase the
price of silver to the mark I have
named it will not be long before we
can insure an international agree
ment for the coinage of silver at a
ratio of fifteen and one-half to one.”
The concluding remarks of the
celebrated economist were received
with great applause.
The details of this English plan of
Mr. Frewen’s as published in the re
port are certainly not very distinct,
but the reader can now take his
choice to either endorse the Frewen
or “Goschen plan” and be a blind
follower of English financiers, who
are evidently co-operating with cer
tain American manipulators, or in
sist upon an independent American
course that will bring the largest
measure of relief to our own manu
facturers, producers and labor; or he
can take a stand-pat attitude, even
with all the evidence now before us
and accumulating every day, and as
sume that no evil results can come to
us from our present policy. Then see
where we will be in a few years
hence. JAMES CONZETT.

Costume Party
The Costume Party given on Val
entine evening by Mrs. J. D. Watson,
Mrs. O. S. Lee and Miss Needham at
Hon. Thos. E. Wason’s was the occa
sion of a large gathering and the
evening was one continual round of
merriment from the appearance of
the guests until their departure at
twelve o’clock.
The entire lower floor of the beau
tiful home was thrown open to the
guests, and throughout the house
the decorations kept one in mind of
the patron saint of the day. Myriads
of red hearts were used, draped over
doors, festooned over windows, and
all over the house ropes of them
extended from the chandeliers to the
corners of the rooms. Red electric
globes and red shaded tapers added
to the beauty of the scene, the house
being especially wired for the even
ing.
Potted plants and smilax were
used everywhere, and in the living
room were fragrant sweet peas. In
the dining room the handsome cluny
lace of the table was laid over red,
and an immense cluster of crimson
carnations stood on a crystal plateau.
Dishes of glace fruits, of salted nuts,
and of bon-bons in the form of flow
ers were scattered over the table.
In an alcove opening from the
dining room punch was served by
Miss Lucile Ware and Miss Carolyn
Dozier. In the breakfast room coffee
and sandwiches were served by
Misses Ada Hawes, Willie Belle Mar
tin and Lois Ware. The ices were
in the forms of pink cupids and the
cakes were heart-shaped.
The guests came in costume. The
quaint and the beautiful were repre
sented, and the ludicrous as well,
some of the characters causing a gale
of laughter on their appearance.
Partners were chosen by matching
pieces of paper hearts. They then
wrote valentines to each other, which
were later read aloud to the merri
ment of the company. The first la-
(51)* Jeffersonian
dies’ prize, a gold incrusted cut glass
ring £tand and jewel tray, was won
by Miss Marion Gross. The second
prize, a beautiful copy of the Hang
ing of the Crane, was won by Miss
Erin O’Neal. The first gentlemen’s
prize, a silver match box, fell to Mr.
E. D. Borders, and the second, a
heart-shaped silver key ring, to Mr.
J. B. Stovall.
The three hostesses of the evening
were assisted in receiving by Mr. and
Mrs. Watson, Mr. O. S. Lee, Mr. J. D.
Watson, Mrs. Cora Harrison and Miss
Ethel Jones. Mrs. T. E. Watson wore
white embroidered in lavender; Mrs.
J. D. Watson was gowned in white,
with touches of blue; Mrs. O. S. Lee
wore a dainty gown of white and
pink. Miss Needham represented
Valentine in a gown of crimson and
white, with pow Mered coiffure. Mrs.
Harrison was gowned in black and
Miss Jones wore blue. —McDuffie
