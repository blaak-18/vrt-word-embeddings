Tramp rPrinters.
(Fromn the Des Wl ines Register.)
Probably no occupation in life has
in its ranks so many wanderers as the
art typographical. Every printing
office has its legends of their comning
and going. Two years ago died at
BIeyrus, Oliq, 'I'hooaas Wallace, who
was a compositor in Des Moines
twenty-two years before. Prior to
that he was at Iowa City, and set
type oil the journal of the firnt Ter
ritorial Loegi,latre. lie had worked,
at the time of his death, in 2,70U dif
fi*rent otlices, and went to the print.
ers' owI'WId at the :ipe age of eighty
years. As an evi;lnee of the differ
ent ages in whiic, he plied his art,
he pullei ah Rai:nge press in 1821,
and in 187ti Aet type for' "Petroleum
V. Nashiy." in T'oledo, Ohio.
"hlatchet"--if he ever had any oth
er name, nfl one this sidle of his chris
tening fount was ever able to discov
er it--commenced his career in Scot
land in 180. The first yeal the Leg
islatuire was in session in Des Moines
hlatchet appeared here as an actor,
in the first theatrical performance
givcun in this city. lie had but one
eye, and, like most of the tramps,
had an unbounded capacity for ben
zine. lie was a composilion in equl
pa rtof printer, acto u d vagabond,
' and ccelled in each ci racter. Ten
or twelve years aitel he trod the
bhords in Des Moines came back,
the last time travelingoon a pass on
,. the dirt road, which he traversed for
i lack of hecre wherewith to pay stage
fare. The second time he appeared
a as a nter, and a good one Ihe was,
too. rworked on the old Citizen
until he Tad acsueamulated twenty dol
lars. Then hi( started for Georgia,
. intended to tramp theentiredistance.
Two years ago an old, grizzled and
wrinkled man entered the Register
comtposing-room about midnight.-
With easy nonchalance lie introduced
himself as "Old Hatchet." The next
day lie was given work, and the
next, being Sunday, he squandered
his day's wages in forty-rod whisky,
and that night le'slept in the press
room. -ihe estimated that the aggre
gate miles of his tramps exceed sixty
thousand. One trip was from Fort
Leavenworth to California. He was
about seventy years old when he left
SDes Moines, and set fine type without
the aid of spectacles. His favorite
expression, when offered a ride or
when asked why he traveled afoot,
was that it "hurt his feet to ride."
Jack IIarrington is another travel
ling typographer whose flngers have
been plied in the printing offices of
every State. His first exploit in life
was to spend twenty thousand dollars
left him by an accumulative, but
short-lived, paternal ancestor. Then
he commenced to, tramp and soak
himself with the whiskies of all points
ot the compass. He has probably
borrowed half a dollar of every jour
printer in the Union, and when he
dies will attempt to "stand off" with
his undertaker.
Singleterry was a most remarkable
tramp. Born in Ohio, he worked at
his trade until he hadl accumulated
one hundred dollars. Then lie start
ed out to see Mexico, which he did in
company with Zach Taylor. The
close of the war found him at New O
Orleans, and from there he started ,
with the expressed purpose of visit
in every State and Territorial capi
tal. Ten years ago his mission was
completed, Des Moiues being the last,
where iheworked on "State work" to
raise aloney to carry him home to
Ohio. Nearly all of his tramping was
done afoot. lie slept in a press-room i
in preference to a hotel, and in the
asomier-time, was happly while slum
bering in a friendly hay-mow. Like
most of those old-style tramps, lhe '
was an excellent workman, and ouenld
have accumnuated a handsome pro-.
perty had he not been under the in
tluence of the Genius of Unrest.
Jack Allcorn has walked ntil his
feet are spread out as flat as a pan
cake. Htie has counted the ties of
haldf of the r;airoade in the Union. 1
When h was ftifty years old he found
lMiuself at Richmonid, Va., working I
at his trade; The rebellion carommene
ed and Jack's seuntiments told him to 1
go North. The Governiient of the
Confederate States wanted his skill
in the Government Printing-oflee,
and 'ie remainel at Riclhmond, a glay
coated 'Cofe4 guardinug his door to
see that lie did not escape. Six
months of this life was a dull dose,
aid one evening the trumping printer
was among the u missing. The next
tiinme e sawtclhmtond he was swi'ng
itg a sahler in Shieridau's cavalry. At
the close of tihe war he again toek tlhe
road, and last winter, his bead white

Ttria coinudrurm what becomes of
old tramps. Wallace is the only one
of them that~ has been kaown to die;
Sthe others are' still on the go, and
Sgive no symptoms of a relapse into
eithler the grave or quiet. If they

The following, from the Dallas &
SHerald can be repeated with emphasis t
to our farmer. Badgovernment should
not so discourage our people, nor
the entire cultivation of eotton so tax S
their time, as to deter theor from pay- t
n ing attention to their homes : a
r "Our farnmeis are all busy with i.
e their crops, it is true, but' many of
I them have not given that attention li
to improving and repairing their l
i places they should. It is astonishing N
what an effect a little whitewash and o
paint will make in the appearance
and comfort of the farm house. A i
I farmer's leisure can not be better a
r employed than in repairing the fen- If
ces and farm buildings and giving the fa
1 whole place a good whitewashing. b
t Then enough should be laid aside to ti
B got blinds to the house and a few
I books and a good newspaper. The a
farmer's life is a hard one, and he fa
- needs to make his home surroundings iI
as pleasant and as attractive as his ft
means will permit. Where there are s]
girls in the family he should encour
ago them to cultivate flowers in their
hours of leisure, and encourage ai
t fondness for reading, which is, of all lt
resobrees to persona isolated from Il
society, the most delightful. ti
Nothing is calculated to give stran- a
gers, looking at out county, a poor a
opinion of the thrift and intelligence
of our country than seeing the houses
weather-beaten and going to rack, 81
the fences down, the gates off, the ci
weeds growing in the yard and stock
roaming about at liberty everywhere. s'
A farm house and buildings should
be always kept neat and in repair. l1
An hour's work every day will do k
wonders toward converting many a
dilapidated looking old country house
into a pleasant object to the eye, and al
attractive place to its inmates. The fl
old idea that "anything is good ai
enough for Texas," must be aban- Iw
doned. The days of stuflling pillows a
in broken windows and pinning w
quilts up to do duty as doors or cur
tains, should be numbered. The
more comfortable, a farnmer makes tl
himself the better work he can do, s!
whether his means be small or great. Y

The eheerful intelligence that At- tl
torney General Williams has resigned a
will certainly eause auch, rejoicing '
il the South, for their has been in

A DABCURY SPEt.LING MATCl.
The Danbury Neirs says:
An inpromlptn-sl.lling school was t
inaugurated in Merriil's glocery, Sna
turday evening. A youung ima,, who t
last winter aided Mr. Couch in the I
1 nmanaigement of the Nolth Center f
t Sochool, conducttd the class. The ;
I first word he gave out was Indian.
rThe fiatt lman said, ''l-n, dl-i-a, din t
I -India." i
The teachsr shook hishen d. "Well, ii
I declare, I thot I had it," ;aid the pi
speller, with keen disuappiaItamieut ; b
a but he picked up when the seconrd i
I man started and eyed hitr with ca, e
r siderable anxiety. Ih
t The next nman, with dIlsp.rate ear- t!
i nestness, said,,'lI-n1, in, d-e, ode, u-a, ti
I un-Indeun." Ic
Then he sighed, and gazed anxious
1 ly at the teacher, while all old party
at the end of the bench, who was it
watching the efforts with deriaive ,
amusement, turned the quid in his !a
mouth and said :
"You ain't within a rod on't, but h
go on ; let's some tmore try."
The teacher told the econid spl)eller
that he also had failed, whereupon he
sighed again.
Then the third man took hold. He
squared himself upon his sent, and,
holding up one tingets, ticked o£,
the letters with beconmitg solItt'ity,
as follows: "I-n-u, -d-d--a-dt, iuda,
i-n, ini-lndain."
f The old party on the end of the at
bench, who had been teetering an the
precipice of a laugh while this etrort
was being put forth, snickered right s
out in a loud gutiiw at its conclusion.
"Well, that's a spell for you, I
mun' say." And then he laughed a
again. The speller said nothing, bat
he grew very red in the face when his
failure was announcead, and cast a
baleful glance at the old party, whose al
turn had now come, and who said :
"And now I'll tackle that little
word," and he smiled all oever his
face, while his eyes twinkled with ai
mnerriment, and looking sidewayst
from one to the other, he rapidly e
spelled-
"I u in, g-i-n gin, Ingin."
His smile deepened into a broad
grin as he watched the chagrin fluish
to the countenances of the other spel-. t
lers, who had been misled all the ý
time on a wrong pronunciation of the '
word. He was grinning with all his ti
might, when the teacher said: w
"You in't got the right word."n b
"Wh-ah-ot !" and he bore down SI
on the 'brazen.faced youth a look cal- di
culated to freeze him to the bone. e'
"Indian is the word. There is no gi
such word as Itjin," said the teacher. tl
"Oh, there isn't, hey f (sacastical- I°
ly.) Youea know, of course. You thi
know all about it. You pimply--" t
"But, my dear sir, I-'! to
"You needn't apologize to me," at
shouted the old party, stamping the ht
floor with his cane. "Who be you, hi
any way, putting on your airs about or
met I cotdd .twist your 'scrawny
neck off of you in two minutes, you
white-livered puppy, you."
"But, my dear air, let me ez--"
"It- tian't ingin, is it !" ground out ca
the old chap between his teeth. "It's
something else, I suppose. O yes! t
you know, of course. And a nice
one you are with your eddicatien.
Why do0't your mother send back It
those apples she borrowed a month

witlls a triuuphant glare of sarcasm. 11
"But just hear me----"

helping nmy father handle bees in the

I have a tfw gunms of my own get

that one should nmve slow around
I the hives, and if the bees should sur

inch of hik; nose, Le should be com

be.s will know it and reciprocate it,

SlHow to usnee a Grindstone.-Com
man grindsatone-slindles, with a crank
at ooe *end, are open to the great ob
ijection that the stone will never keep
round, because every lperson is in
clined, more of less, to follow the
amotion of his foot with his hand,
which causes the pressure on the
stone to le unequal. The harder
pre::mre is always applied to tahe
very smale part of the stone, and will
soon make it uneven, so that it is
imapossible to grind a tool true. To
avoid this put in place of the crank
a small cog-wheel to the spindle, say
with twelve cogs; have another
short spindle, with a crank and a
cog-wheel of thirteen cogs, to work
into the former. The stone will make
about .0Y7 of a revolution more than
the crank, and the harder pressure of
the tool on the stone will change to
another place at every turn, and the
stone will keep perfectly round if it is
a good one. This is a very simple
contrivance, but it will. be new to
many of our readers.-Cabinet-Ms

Cotswold Merinos. - Cross-bred

Spontaneous Combustion of Ia.t.-.
We frequently hear of conflagratsons
caused by the spontaneous combus
tion of hay. The prevention in such
cases is simple anid cheap. Combus
tion in hay can arise only from one
cause-the dampness thereof. This
may arise from the condition of the
hay when put into the barn or ware
house inunleciently cured, or by be
ing wt by3 exposure to rain. Tihe
precaution is a liberal quantity of
course salt, spridkled through the
mow, which will invariably prevent
the heating which causes combustion.

esperiment was tried on board the
ship Lancauhire in I147, with perfect
success.-Travsler.
Family Glae.--We make our glue
in thie fllowing way: Crack up the
glue and put it in a lbottle; add to it
enmmou whisky; shake up, cork
tight, and in three or four days it
can he ulsed. It requires no heating,
will keep for almost any time, anId is
at all times ready to use except in
the coldest weather, wihen it will re
quire warming. It must be kept
tight, so, that the whisky will not
evaporate. The u~ual corks or stop
pets hoauld not he used. It will be
come clogged. A tin stopper, caver
iag the bttle but fitting as closely
as possible, mwst be used.
We cannot plant anythlling that will
afford greater satisfaction than the
Madeira Vine. A few bulls, or roots
rather, of thi. beauvtiful elimbea, will
in a lew weeks completely cover a
large window frame. It is rather
sensitive to cold, to be srtre, hat a
newspaper passed between the win
ulow and the plant, will protect it
suficieuntly, even upon a severe night.
