New York.—Secretary of Labor
James J. Davis last week ordered the
landing of 4,000 aliens who arrived
here too late to be admitted before
their quotas were exhausted. Davis
explained his action by saying that
he had permitted them to land “on
parole, as an act of humanity.” His
action prevented deportation of the
aliens.
Eleven steamers rushed into port
November 1, when the quotas opened,
bearing 17,000 aliens. Eleven other
ships with additional hordes of aliens
were diverted to other ports, Ellis
Island not being able to take care of
all the foreigners who sought admit
tance to the United States.

When a modern dude sits daintily
consuming the wing of a spring
chicken at 10:30 a. m., he is puzzled,
how his father ever lived through the
pioneer days in Texas, when fried
bacon, corn bread, and black coffee,
were considered positive luxuries.
Unless all the girls of the present
generation are educated as trained
nurses, I fail to see, how they will
ever be able to keep their husbands
alive—after they get ’em.

MENACE OF MODERN IMMIGRATION
By Dr. H. W. Evans, Imperial Wizard
An Address Delivered October 24th on Klan Day at Texas
Continued From
As an alternative to the first sug
gestion, however, if the Congress be
now reluctant to close and lock the
gates against all immigration, pend
ing the most far-reaching inquiry, it
might not greatly increase our imme
diate danger to continue the quota
law, provided that 1880, and not 1910,
were made the ratio basis for admis
sion. Up to 1880 fully 95 per cent of
cur immigration was of the Nordic
types, the kindred, desirable, easily
assimilable kind. By 1910 it was an
overwhelming flood of inferior for
eign elements. Therefore, any con
tinuance of the quota principle,
whether tentative or permanent, must
revert to that earlier period when the
influx was of a character that did not
perceptibly lower our standards of
American private and public life.
Further, if that basis be retained,
the quota should be extended also to
all the countries of this continent, to
fortify our borders to the South and
North. I need only to remind you that
last year more than ten per cent of
all the aliens coming to us were from
Mexico, where the quota law does not
apply.
But regardless of whether or not
the quota basis be retained, we, as
Americans, seeking American su
premacy for this nation because that
is altruism’s highest goal, should de
mand that any permanent immigra
tion policy shall bring about a com
plete reversal of the existing situa
tion, both as to principle and practice.
Now, the immigration motive is all
in alien circles. Likewise, and equal
ly unstatesmanlike, the agencies for
the examination and admission of im
migrants are upon this side of the
water.
The Selection, and then the invita
tion to come, should originate here:
the machinery should be there.
We should know, we must know,
rot by guesswork, but through exact
analysis of our needs, both the num
ber and quality of people whose mi
gration to America would be of last
ing advantage for all concerned. Their
domicile here cannot aid any element
iff it enervates us. Our wholesome
ness, our stamina, as a nation is the
hope of humanity everywhere. A sel
fish, militant, attention to the com
posite character of our citizenship be
comes at once the most saintly, unsel
fish and altruistic endeavor to which
we can turn our hearts and hands.
I say, therefore, that eliminating en
tirely all considerations save con
structive benefit to ourselves, think
ing only of the fulfillments of God’s
purpose of a superior Christian civil
ization for America, after learning
where, why and to what extent immi
grants can advance our common wel
fare, we should say to kindred coun
tries having our ideals and aspira
tions:
“There is in America a place for
so many thousands, or tens of thou
sands, of your best citizens. We in
vite them to settle in this or that
particular place, where the need ex
ists for agricultural production, or
creative labor. For their conven
ience and our own safety, we will
move our Ellis Islands to your land.
That machinery, renovated and rein
vigorated with the true American
spirit, Will make all decisions as to
their physical, mental and moral fit
ness before your sons and daughters
begin the pilgrimage tq America.
Their admissibility will be deter
mined before they start. Then no
uncertainty, no financial danger, no
dread of unsettled consequences, can
mar the journey.
“Officially and spiritually will we
await their coming with words and
deeds of welcome. Traditionally, if
not directly by ties of blood, they will
be our kindred. We invite them to
come, to remain, to join with us in
the sacred creation of a country of
freedom and justice, governed by
and for the millions of its people, a
land of happy, wholesome homes, out
of which the spirit and purpose of
American patriotism shall overflow
to every nook and corner of the Re
public, and finally in God’s good time,
bring its blessings to all mankind.”
The divine intention, it seems to
me, has been manifest from the be
ginning. Ages and ages before this
country was called America. He
fashioned this land in surpassing
beauty and placed in it and upon it
£ varied, exhaustless store of re
sources to which His favored chil
dre;
n could apply their genius and
attain new heights of human wel
fare. On all the planet there was
no country approaching its perfec
tion. Throughout the centuries,
when man was savagely struggling
upward, learning the lessons of life
at the cost of death to himself and
devastation to his possessions, Amer
ica remained hidden. It was as
though His choicest earthly heritage
were being kept concealed until a
superior ppople should emerge to jus
tify its habitation. Certainly it so
came to pass. The discovery, long
delayed, was timed to the advent of
settlers with character and accom
plishments completely in harmony
with that conception. To this great
Eden journeyed the bestr and bravest
of the Old World, among whom in
turn only the bravest and best were
able to survive. There was a double
State Fair, Dallas.
•t Week's Issue
refinement of these pioneer patriots,
first through the strength and cour
age required for their emancipation
abroad, and then in their triumph
over the dangers and adversities of a
virgin environment. The birth of
this nation, out of that holy alliance
of the highest human and heavenly
purposes, marked a new era for or
ganized society; it brought new light
and new hope to the world. That
was, and is, America’s mission. Dur
ing a hundred years of national ex
istence, there was uninterrupted evo
lution toward such a destiny, be
cause, as God intended for this Re
public, its comoosite people were
physically, mentally and morally
virile, with an inherent, kindred rev
erence for rightly established insti
tutions and a oneness of heart and
mind concerning the principles which
would insure their perpetuity.
We are wont to measure our treas
ures in the fertility of the soil, the
lumber footage of forests, the horse
power of waterfalls, the thundering
speed of transportation, the output
of mines, the production of factories,
the balances of banks, but say to you
that our greatest public asset cannot
be expressed in terms of property.
Individuals are vastly more valuable
than dividends. Unless there be a
high average of people to whom
worldly wealth may safely be en
trusted, material possessions will
proye a curse to humanity, a stone
about the neck of civilization. If we
are to attain and hold and merit true
national grandeur, no form of wealth
is a all comparable to an ever-as
cending per capita of intelligence,
health and virtue. Likewise, I say
to you that never need we greatly
fear any kind of debt except bankr
rupted ideals and impoverished pa
triotism.
Solemnly, as befits so epochal a
task, and in all humility, but with
the unquenchable fire of divine convic
tion in our hearts, let us face this
responsibility, the greatest God has
ever placed upon a people. We have
the power, and the opportunity again
to turn the Republic toward the ful
fillment of her destiny. There is yet
time if we act today; tomorrow may
be too late for the redemption of
America.
REWRITING HISTORY
The surest propaganda in the world
is through the public schools. The
most impressionable thing in nature
is the mind of a child, and the im
press made upon the plastic sub
stance of the mind is eternal. Not
all the subsequent education, not all
the most convincing reasoning, nor all
the experiences of life ever serve to
completely eradicate impressions re
ceived in childhood. This is the most
appalling discovery in psychology.
For centuries the Jesuits have
known this transcendently impor
tant truth, and the almost fanatical
insistence'by the priests upon the im
perative necessity of keeping within
the church the educational control of
the children is founded upon the sur
est science.
During recent years every known
interest, cause and movement, good,
bad and indifferent, altruistic and
selfish, has sought to exploit the
schools with their peculiar doctrines,
economic, social or religious. Boards
of education and superintendents have
had to be on guard constantly to pro
tect the children from the various
brands of propaganda, some crass,
some insidious, some very ingenious.
Recently a certain brand of relig
ionists, tying up their efforts with a
particularly noxious brand of racial
bigotry, have announced, with much
beating of the tin cans of publicity,
that they are having prepared the
first, simon-pure, all-wool and a yard
wide American history ever written.
Knowing with what Machiavellian
speciousness this organization in
times past has wrested history to suit
its own ends, the warning went forth
to look out for it. History from such
a source must be tainted.
But to clear the way for this uni
que history, vicious attacks are being
made upon histories now in use in the
schools. Muzzey, Hart, West and
other standard authorities have been
subjected to scathing arraignment in
New York, Washington and other
Eastern cities. It is a nation-wide
campaign having a common instiga
tion.
It is dll very sinister, and every
school board member and every
school superintendent should prepare
for the attack. When the schools be
come the exploiting ground of sec
tarian religion and ecclesiastical big
otry, God help democracy!—R. E.
Blight in the New Age.
“Until it has been proved other
wise, we shall hail thei K. K. K. as
the great movement that is now on
foot as the army divinely appointed
to set the forces in operation to res
cue Americanism and our free insti
tutions.”—Bishop White.
Is life so dear, or peace 30 sweet,
as to be purchased at the price of
chains and slavery? —Patrick Henry.

STATE FUNDS FOR
SECTARIAN PURPOSES
Pennsylvania Makes War On Legislative Apt

attention to a. great and growing evil educational or benevolent purposes,
throughout the nation. the money of the people shall not be
One of the fundamental principles
of our American democracy is the
separation of church and state. The
Roman Catholic church has never will
ingly accepted this doctrine but for
a century has sought by every means
in its power to obtain access to pub
lic funds by securing state aid
through legislative enactment for the
maintenance of its educational and
philanthropic institutions. In some
states it has gone so far as to demand
appropriations directly for religious
buildings, as in California where
funds have been given to the church
to rebuild Franciscan missions.
Throughout the country there is an
awakening to a realization that ap
propriations of a sectarian character
violate not only the spirit but the
letter of the Constitution.
The state constitution of Pennsyl
vania distinctly provides that “no
appropriation shall be made to any
denominational or sectarian institu
tion.” Despite this specific inhibition
it is estimated that in the years from
1881 to 1915 appropriations exceed
ing ten millions of dollars had been
made to various sectarian institu
tions. Of the ten million dollars paid
out of the state treasury, it is esti
mated that eight million went to Ro
man Catholic institutions, one million
to Jewish and one million to institu
tions maintained under Protestant
auspices.
The camouflage of philanthropy
worn by these institutions as a dis
guise for their true purpose, which is
to promote ecclesiastical interests
through benevolences, is ruthlessly ex
posed by the supreme court of Penn
sylvania in its decision under date of
July 1, 1921, when it says:
“After studying and reflecting up
on the carefully prepared opinions of
the court below, the arguments of
able counsel and the authorities cited,
we have reached the deliberate con
clusion that when a charitable, bene
volent or educational establishment is
‘denominational or sectarian’ accord
ing to the meaning of this term, as
understood by the average man, even
though the institution in question may
bestow its benefits on others, and per
mit those outside the ranks of the sect
or denomination involved to take part
in its management it is none the less
a sectarian or denominational insti
tution, within the inhibition of the
constitution against state aid.”
In spite of the decisions of the su
preme court and the plain provisions
of the state constitution, the Penn
sylvania legislature of 1923 passed
fifty-six appropriation bills, appro
priating a total of $1,693,900 to sec
tarian institutions. The Anti-Sec
tarian Appropriations Association
promptly notified the governor and
the attorney-general of the charac
ter of these institutions and prepared
briefs in every case, giving the facts
and the law in relation thereto.
In consequence thereof the gover
nor, on July 14, 1923, vetoed thirty
eight (38) of these bills, carrying ap
propriations of $1,075,100. The re
maining bills he approved with re
ductions amounting to $250,300. So
that the total of vetoes and reduc
tions amounts to $1,325,400.
As a result of the legal contests
inaugurated by the association dur
ing the last four years over three
million dollars have been saved to
the state treasury that otherwise
would have been used for the support
of sectarian schools and philanthropic
enterprises.
In an effort to evade the constitu
tional prohibition, a scheme is being
worked out by interested parties
whereby hospitals maintained under
sectarian auspices may receive sub
stantial state aid under a state fund
“out of which (so the law would
read) payment can be made to said
hospital for actual service rendered
to persons to whom the common
wealth owes a duty, and not to grant
a gratuity to said institution.”
This scheme is a very adroit effort
to obtain state aid without techni
cally violating the constitution. It
is most interesting and maybe signi
ficant that in the tentative figures
submitted showing the practical work
ing of the plan, Roman Catholic in
stitutions would receive $1,388,500,
Jewish institutions would get SBO,OOO
and Protestant institutions would get
—nothing!
The clever scheme undoubtedly is
doomed to failure. The supreme court
of the state has put itself on record
in unequivocal terms (Collins vs. Kep
hart, 271 Pa. page 432):
“The history of the development of
social and political life in America
shows a set purpose to divorce, ab
solutely, church and state; and this is
the real underlying explanation of
provisions like the one now before us,
.which appear, in one form or another,
in the constitutions of many Ameri
can commonwealths. The intent of
put under denominational control or
into sectarian hands for administra
tion or distribution, no matter how
worthy the end in view.”

THE KU KLUX KLAN HAS
NO RIGHT TO EXIST?
How many times have you heard
that statement?
All right—let us look into the
facts of the case. Supposing that
you are an American citizen, white
Protestant, believing in the tenets of
the Christian religion and owing no
allegiance to any foreign power.
Can you join the Knights of Colum
bus? No! Why? Because you do
not meet with their requirements—
namely, you are not a Catholic.
Can you join the B’Nai B’Rith?
No! Why? Because you do not
meet with their requirements—name
ly. you are not of the Jewish faith.
Can you join the Afro-American
Brotherhood? No! Why? Because
you do not meet with their require
ments—namely, you are not colored.
Now why—in the name of all that’s
just, can’t you and I have an organi
zation that no one but you and I and
the fellow that meets your require
ments belong to?
If being a 100 per cent American
is wrong, then the Ku Klux Klan is
wrong.
If having a white skin is a dis
grace, then the Ku Klux Klan should
cease to be.
If believing that Christ is the Son
of God is something to be shamed of
then let’s condemn the Ku Klux Klan.
And if we are afraid to say that
we are Protestants, we must keep
clear of the Klan, for the Catholic
church might not like it.
BUT—every man with a spine up
the middle of his back who loves this
dear old country of ours, its flag and
its sacred institutions, every man
who still believes in the principles

THE FIERY SUMMONS
By the LION OF
The white-hooded, white-robed rid
er, astride the plunging thoroughbred
steed of Right and lighting my be
loved land with his P’lery Cross held
high, rode into my heart —a signal,
sacred, God-sent honor.
He was the personification of all
righteousness, coming to leave the
impress of zealousness, which was
his, on this old heart of mine. I will
forever remember him and hold him
in sublime reverence, for he is my
Criterion of Character as our Lord
Christ is his.
Beneath his hood, I knew the
Great Conscience of God was graven,
giving him to see all, know all, fer
ret out all mal-odorous deeds of man
k
ind, and, too, to smack of the good
nesses and hear of the songs of man.
Wisdom his robed body embraced,
together with the embodiment of the
ideals and principles and aims of the
forefaothers who gave to us that
classic vehicle by which our lives are
molded: the Constitution of the Unit
ed States of America. His fervid vis
cera held intact that power of our
American institutions and that power
of construction for the building of
those temples of right scattered
everywhere over the country. His
heart? It was the symbol of the
American home.
His mighty, Protestant right arm
waved aloft his hand, which was
Spirit, its fingers closing about his
Sacred Cresset, the Fiery Cross, and
were synonymous of Truth, Love,
Purity, Righteousness, Immortality.
His just Klannish left arm drew in his
steed with that hand, which was Life,
to halt inside me, its fingers holding
secure the reins—fingers which meant
Honor, Chivalry, Nobility of Charac
ter, the preservation of the Sanctity
of the Home and of the Chastity of
Pure Womanhood.
His stead was ready, eager to get
on, but the rider dismounted, his no
ble limbs, Church and State, striding
fearlessly toward my vital spark, in
the paths of His making, on feet of
Solidarity and Power. He stopped,
his feet planted firmly in my heart,
the toe 3of Solidarity, which repre
sented Christianity, Benevolence, Loy
alty, Education, Liberty, gripping the
tendrils of my heart’ ventricle, and
those of Power, which were Law,
White Supremacy, Gentile, Patriot
ism, Klankraft, entwining themselves
in the valves of my heart's auricle.
His keen Eye of Scrutiny, blazing
through the eyeholes of his clean,
white hood, held me enthralled. I
saw the Light of Wisdom there. He
spoke—clearly and imperiously calm.
“I am the Ku Klux Klan,” he said,
and I leaned forward to catch his
every word. “I am riding over our
land from its Core of Inherent Purity
to its Scrofulous Skin—from its warm
Heart of Brotherly Love, through its
tainted Blood-Stream, to its minut
est Questionable Capillary—from its
God-given Brain of Justice and Law
and Order to its most twisted Peri
pheral Nerve-endings—ever on the
alert, never sleeping. There is much
for me to do. I am doing it. Over
mountains and valleys I go, through
states, cities and hamlets, bringing
along my own American-born Revival
of Righteousness. The ravaging
forest-fires, stuffing into its gorging
mouth everything obstructing its
passage is as naught to the ardor
of my sweep of the nation. I am
building Temples and Pyramids of
Love, Charity and Justice, far great
er to us than to the ancient Egypt
ians were those material ones built
by Khufa the Cheops of the Greeks,
in the Fourth Egyptian Dynasty.
“The period of moral retrogression
even turpitude, which came upon us
like an avalanche with the great
World War, and which is still ram
pant in our midst, is fast being
crushed by this revival. These slimy,
reeking, hideous, hell-beings who are
pecuniarily profiting by the errors
and sins of those weak creatures
writing and wriggling in the slough
of meretricious despond—those human
vultures preying upon the unfortunate
and helpless alike—those insidious
influences in the determined perpe
tration of undermining our American
institutions by inciting acts, treacher
ous and criminal, and, when commit
ted, try to foist them onto me by way
of imputation and even false accu
sation —those insignificant, encepha
lic, despotic, gubernatorial creatures
who, through intimidation, bribery
and the eager susceptibility of the
ignorant and vicious—all, who cast
wily innuendoes, malicious lies and
vilifications on my character are
slowly, though none the less positive
ly, being beaten out of their filthy
hostility by my great and only God
given American weapon—the Civil
Courts of Justice.
“Through the fire of my zeal, mil
lions of our citizens are readily en
tering my Vanguard of the Right.
Some I found by the roadside, flound
ering in the Darkness of Spiritual
Neglest, others Religiously Destitu
ent, seeking, seeking they knew not
what (but now they have found), and,
together with those -Protestant Christ
ian soldiers who hitherto were some
what skeptical (but who are now a
part of me), are all become my in
dividual Harbingers of Light.
“Under the pressure of my left
foot, Power, and by the strangling
grip about their throats, which is the
LOGAN SQUARE
Strength of Public Enlightenment
(erstwhile supposed gullibility), these
maggots of shrieking newsp&perdom
which cast their crafty, deceptive in
nuendoes and venomous accusations
are being stifled. They are being
lashed by the boomerangs of the syn
dicated vileness of their own creation.
Their spraiching protests, which are
retch-and-nausea-inducing, are ring
ing insistently silent in America’s
ears. Those lying others are going
down tQ defeat in civil court proceed
ings.
“I am not to be thworted. I can
not be retarded. I ride on forever
for my God, my Country, my Home.”
He paused a moment; then pointed
at me his right forefinger, which was
Truth.
“You!” he said with unwavering,
unflinching directness. “You belong
to me, as do all American-born, Pro
testant, White, Gentile People, for I
know your heart, as theirs, beats true.
Therefore I knight you with the high

“Now I must go, but I do so itsub.”
And the White-robed Personifica

about. In an inkling he was swung
upon his eager mount, speeding
toward others’ hearts to leave his
zealous impress there.
In my heart, now, has become fer

Speaking in New York before the
League for Political Education, Israel
Zangwill was vastly helpful in the
examination of the faults and virtues
of American life. The most interest
ing of the observations which he
made was of “an absence of dignity
in this country” which he found “ex
emplified in many ways.” This criti
cism, one is at first inclined to re
sent, but maturer consideration shows
it to be well founded. One instance
will serve as an illustration. Cer
tainly dignity is never so completely
sacrificed as in the effort to dignify
what is obviously ludicrous. Our
public is in the habit of putting on
its best wearing apparel and attend
ing the lectures of visitors who, after
a few days’ observation of such as
pects as fore themselves upon the
casual eye, feel fully equipped to re
flect our life in a critical mirror.
Our mistaking of these comedians
for weighty, philosophic fellows is of
course preposterously lacking in dig
nity. To preserve our self-respect
we should either stay away from such
sideshows or at least not pull long
faces at the antics of the clowns.
Mr. Zangwill betrays a little of
personal resentment against this
country which inclines one to take
all of his criticism with a grain of
salt. “America years ago went to
war because of taxation without rep
resentation,” Mr. Zangwill reminds
us. “Today I am taxed eight per
cent of all I earn in this country.
Yet I have no vote.” The explana
tion of this cutting epigram is that
our government takes a share of the
earnings of the American produc
tions of Mr. Zangwill’s plays as it
takes a share of the earnings of the
plays of everyone. It gives Mr.
Zangwill no vote because he happens
not to have seized the advantages of
citizenship in this country. Surely
only one who expected to raise a
laugh would suggest that preference
be shown him in the matter of roy
alties because the money will be
taken from this country once it has
been amassed. What Mr. Zangwill
should do is to dramatize himself in
a three-act comedy. It would be the
most riotous farce of his distin
guished career. —St. Paul Dispatch.

ODD FELLOWS INSIST
ON ENGLISH RITUAL
Cincinnati, O.—One of the most in
teresting and hardest fights we had
here in the grand lodge of Odd Fel
lows • was that all ritualistic work in
the lodge room hereafter must be in
English. There are more than one
hundred lodges where the work has
been done for years in foreign
tongues. This has been brewing for
several years, but always postponed,
the members being afraid to tackle
it; but Americanism is abroad in the
land, and at the session recently it
could not be sidetracked, and the real
Americans forced the issue, and after
much discussion, the vote was that
all work must be in English in this
country. During the past year Odd
Fellows gave to charity $7,708,000,
which was $50,000 over the previous
year. The session was a most inter
esting one, and 60,000 Odd Fellows
were in Cincinnati.
