Strong Reasons for a Constitutional
Convention.
The colored people of New Orleans.
are wirng led astr1ay nain. and this
time by no less a n.rsoncue thann
Pinclihnek. nupon the u hjeCt of mnixed
Elhools. It qefi1a that. one Pauln
Trevigne has ied out a writ of in
rinntion to prevent tihe separation of
-lorted front white children in the
S'0!c sch'ols, and the writ ihas ,been
11tei iv hlie Courts ; while it will
also he sustaiuled and made perpetu
III, no donubt.
The Democrat of thie 2Rtl Septem
ler has an naiticle upon thie subjlect,
weak in its bearing upon TIrevigne,
lcennse he stands incased behind an
article in the present villainous Con
stitution the Courts cannot ignore,
but strong and unanswernbleo as an
argument in favor of a new Consti
tution. If the TDemocrat will permit
us we will point out the weakness of
its article, to which our attention has
been called by more than one gen
tleman, for it must he remembered
that the Democrat is the most ex
tensively read in this parish of all
papers published in New Orleans.
The Democrat very properly do
noun'es the tprer nt Constitution in
termti w'i.-h '. fulls applaud ; but,
the Democrat forgets there is but one
wany to preven't the mixture of chlil
dren in pnublic schools in this State,
and that is Iby a new Co18sti1tution.
Thalt pnapel's eloquent burst of indig
nation at the attempt of "this haugh
+v son of Ham" (Trevigne) to dis
til) the present pence and quiet of
he State-- the hope it expresses ot
very "little profit" accruing to those
ho would resist a separation of pub
'ic school children, meets our fall and
heauty approbation. But this does
not, nor will not shltakeTrevigne, who,
hull dog like, clings to the "infamons
Counstitution," enacted for the pur
pose of our "degradation, hiumilia
tion and shamne," and against which
we sent up in 1868, "a most piteous
appeal to our conquerors to save us
from"-tlhis Constitution, reeking
with all this, hie has, and the Courts
must susatain its provisions, no mat
ter how infamous or how degrading,
else must they perjuro thetmselves.
Would our friends of the Democrat
ask this of an honorable, honest
judget We think not, but still they
propose no other remedy than, that
the Judge shall ignore the very arti
cle in thIe Constitution which is a
printed evidence of our degradation,
and to which his Honor is cited, and
upon which is based Trevigne's de
mand for an injunction!
Again does the Democrat indulge
in false philosophy, when it asserts
that under the "worst laws, adminis
tered by wise, honest, and devoted
public servants, the interests of so
ciety can be 1ri-otected and advanc
ed." If snch were the case, there
could be no "worst laws," hecause
laws are to be judged as good or bad,
as they retard or advance, by their
'xeceuti.)n, the interests of society.
No law which ib a bad law can ad
vance thIe interests of civil society,
no matter who may administer it,
and as a perfect settler to the Demo
erat6' philosophy, it complains of a
law, as degrading as ever disgraced a
Statute book, wvhiclt, if enforced even
by Governor Nicholls, "a wise, hon
east and devoted public servant,"
would result in a destruction of the
public school system, and thereby
retard tihe interests of society.
Our friends have nmistaken the
remedy-it is not in good Governors,
bot ngneogd Laws it is not in peace
and quiet, but in honest Constitu
tions, and just so long as the present
instrument remains in force, just so
iong will these troubles occnr, and
society be hindered in its advance.
The Judge who will pass upon this
injunction hlas nothing to do but to
grant it, houwever repagnant to his
feelings it may, and no doubt will be.
IJe is a "wise, honest and devoted"
Judge, and is addministering a law
which infamous as it is, the Demo
erat'b own pltilosophy should require
it to acquieso in.
Thmepeop). of tlmia State have all
alorrg, for three months or more, been
demanding the only remedy for the
"worst laws," which by their enforce
nient deter society from advagcing
that remedy is a eosnethietonal Con
veution, and a new Caniitisntion. We
ask the Democrat to disabnue its mind
of one thing, 'tho majority of the
people are in favor of the Conven
tion, and they have the right to ask
of the Dbemorat its able and full snp
port to the end that an organie law
may he lamed and adopted which
will not be "lostilb tb eivilized so
siety."

SHREVEPORT.
The Importance of its Prosperity.
Over two years since, the VIsoIcNa
Tro vigorously urged the advantages
to be derived by the North Louisiana
ipa ishes from the advance of the city
of Shreveport in prospe'rity, pop1na
tioni andl hIusiness importance. Since
then we have, from time to time, te
fr-red to this important siaujeCt, and
we are pleased to note that at this
momenlt, many of our enterprising
and infiential citizens are advoca
ting Shreveport and its growing pins
perity as of especial interest to this
section.
It is upon the same principle as ti-e
diversity of wealth that the prosperi
ty of a people is enhanced by the
building up of numerous cities or
tratle centers thronghout the ncorrntry.
New Orleans for instance, althongh
of importance to us at this distance
as a cotton anti sugar manrt, is of mxore
benefit to those parishes and people
in close proximity. It is a market
close at hand for those thousand and
one produclitions of farm labor other
thann cotton or sugar ; for the prodnuct
of the dairy, the fowl house and the
garden. Our distance renders it inm
possible for us to comrpete with the
near parishes. while, if we had a city
as near as Shreveport its 'ells of
thousands of consunlers would create
a demand for articles this parish
coull, and would produce and ship
with a profit, to supply.
Look at New York State with its
hundred fine inland cities-trade cen
ters, and then suppose they were all
ti ansplantecd in New York city, wounld
not the State and its people be poor
er? Undoubtedly.
Our interest is in Shreveport and its
advancement, and we can conceive of
no better occasion thIan that of the
Immigration Convention, which will
take place next Wednesday, to hing
eout strongly the feeling of North
Louisiana towards their young city.
With the united efforts of twenty
parishes, Shreveport will be able to
contenid with advantage for a grent
ness, her enterprise and geogranphic
locality entitle her to, and which,
once acquired, will add prosperity
and wealth to all North Lonisiana.
The New Orleans Times should re
member that the VINDICATOR was
indignant because of its high regard
for Major Burke, and for the appre
ciation in which we held his services
to the people. If Major Burke had
been a nobody, as the Times is, we
would have cared not one whit
whether lie said the things imputed
to him or not. But we will not al
low the Times to criticise us on any
thing. If it will refer to its files of
January 3d, 1876, it will know the
reason why! And we think this an
occasion, and a good one to say to
that sheet once for all, that for stu
pidity, grose malignity, and infa
mous slandering, it~is withont a peer.
The Times has nothlng to do with the
people of this State-except perhaps
to slander theem, as it lhaus done us in
tile past. We would beg to call its
attention to the fact, that Governor
Nicholls has been charged by it with
a purpose, expressed in advance, of
pardoning Wells and Anderson, in
the event of their conviction-which
statement we fully believe to be of
its usual cloth, a slanderous lie.

VERNON.
P.ARISH OF VIXRNON,
September 23rd, 1877.
Dear Vindicator :
We are taught that government is
institiuted among men to secure "Life,
Liberty, and the pursuit qf hiappi
iess,"'' and that the greater' good to
the greatest ntmber shouli be the
I ihas upon which all laws are founid
ed. These maximis were acted upon
by thei founders of this great Rlepult
Slic in their etlurts to establish a gov.
erniuent whlich they thought wonuld
more nearnly approachl their ideal
standard than any u iiich then, or
ever had existed. And uvith the de
feets of the governments of the Old
World before tlrheir eyes as tingem
hoards, to guard tlhem against tihe
despo'tisnm that existed in all of them.
they sneceeded in establishing the
r presest, and happiest govern oment thll;t
ever existed among men, and he
ientrhed it to as to nourish and sti
port, in thie lond hope that it ever
woiuld be an asylum for the oppres
rsed, down-trodden, tax-ridden refi
gees from despotisnm.
The Constitution was adopted and
set up as a bireak-water against the
I arrogance of what might become an
opl'pressi e nmajority, and agai tist
which a weak mriurity might lean in
security.
Have we been faithful to the tnrust I
Would those Immortal builders it they
ware permitted to return to earth tee
ognize in the bond issuing aristocracy
undler which we groan. the '"fair tlah
nrie" which they erected I I thirrk not
and when in the agony of their dis
appointmeiint, they turned in search of
the Constitution which caused them
such anxions thonught, we pointed to
the mntilated remainus of that instrn
ment, all blood-stained and dtsfigured,
I think that I hear theni cry out in
their anguish," Oh ! how have our
childrein departed froni our prcepts!o
bIow have they dared ti) lay their
sacrilegeous hai;nds in violence upon
tihe charter of theitir liberties whliel.
we bequeathed to them in the belief
that the example of our virtnues would
f inspire them withI a determination to
hand the precious heritage down to
Sgenerations unborn, that millions
might rise up anti call them blessed.
'"llut lust for poiwer, and the worship
I of Mamnmon have led thleni astray from
the green fields of virtue, into the by
paths of vice and immorality." In vain
were the labors of Jefferson when lhe
overturnedl priniogeniture, thatengine
of a landed aristocracy, in vain did he
avoid every thing like parade or dis
play, while lie was President, that
there might be no sign boards set tip,
by which an Aristocracy may creep
iiinto the destruction of simple Rlepub
lien government. For to-day there
is an nristocracy more arrogi'!t ihit
athat against which he exerted thle i''s
ir of his mighty intellect, Hoe ;otent
for the destruct ion of Republican gov
ernment, and the establishment of
centralization which has taken fast
I holdl on the reins of the governmient.
SThe monied aristocracy. It hascor
t rptedl every arm of our govei nmen t.
It manipulates the law.making power
to its own naggrandizement, greases the
palms of the Judiciary. and feathe'rs
the seat of the Executive, and right
between the thieves in the two hallsi
of Congress will crneify the Ondes
e of Liberty unless the honest yeomanry
1 of the land rise in their might and by
united, action dtive its mininions frou

N what he hams tone fr the South, on the

ic party. The opposition is led by (Gb -
er:ml Jubal Early, Captain Whitehmi'ald aid
Major Daniel, auid is backed by the rich
eat and most influential people of the city
In fact, the opposition hero is greater and
more outspoken than in any other place
that the President has visited duriiig tIme
present trip. In an article that will be
pulilished in the local paper to morrow,
General Early thins states his position:
I So far from having my eyes o)eiwd to
the error of our cause by the result of the
war-as seemns to have been the case with
some other secessionists per SC besieles
Judge Key, under liii influinec ofl'edealr
ii piatrouiige-these results, together with
r the conduct of our adversaries Iboth dir
ing and siiice the war, have had a direct
ly contrary effect on me. and served to in
t unity anl solidify my fomeTr convictions.
I aim now firnly convinced that the (Gov
e einment of the United States can never he
- restored to a condition of stable constitn
tional sounduess until it is administered
in the leading principle utpon which our
struggle was based- that is, the recogni
7 tion of the Union as a confederation of
3 co-equal sovereign States, eacr of which
is vested with the resolute right to regu
late its own domestic policy, sublject only
to the restriction coitained in the Con
stitution strictly construed. I am not
hopeful of sach a result under the most
favorable circumstances; but I verly be
lieve if the blandishments of power and
reduction of Federal patronage, coupled
with delnsive views of the President's
5outhem policy, shall succeed in disinte
grating the Conscrvative, the Democratic
party of the South, to an extent silticient
to secure the continnance in power of the
Radical party, or of any conglomeration of
it, theii there will not only be no hope of
a restoration of constitutional liberty, tint
the d(ays of the so-called Rep blic will he
numb. red. We are too proud to forget that
r faithful are the wounds of a friend bnt the
kisses of an enemy are deceitful.' '
