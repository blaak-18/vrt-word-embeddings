WR EXS CAR
Five Men HoldL Up a Train Near
Homestead, Mont,
ROOF IS BLOWN OFF.
Reports as to the Amount of Cash
Obtained Vary, but the Messen.
ger Says it :Is Not Over
Five Hundred Dollars.
Butte, Mont., Feb. 13.-The Burling
ton express No. 6, east bound, was
held up shortly after midnight yester.
day morning on the Northern Pacific
tracks eight miles east of this city,
near Homestead, by five mounted
men. The train was a double header
and the engines, with the mail and
express cars, were run about 600 feet
ahead of the rest of the train. In
a few moments after the train stop
ped there were two explosions of dy
namite, which wrecked the express
car. The roof was blown off, but
no one was injured.
Reports as to the amount of booty
secured by the robbers vary. The
express messenger says the robbers
did not get more than $500. In other
quarters it is said the plunder will
amount to several thousand dollars
at least. It is also said that several
mail pouches were rifled. A railway
mail clerk was shot in the holdup.
It is not thought his wounds are dan
gerous.
When the express messenger real
ized there was a holdup he tossed a
package of money he held In his hand
upon the rack above his head and
this money was probably saved. This
fact can not be definitely known,
however, until an opportunity Is given
for a search of the wrecked car.

He notified Mr. Sinchot to meet him

that a tree should be removed proceed
ed to remove it, and so Mr. Roosevelt
has been performing the Gladstonian

having been felled with the ax wielded
by the hands that rule the nation.
Representative Kahn of California
recently received a petition from a San
Francisco constituent
for the inproduction of
some mechanism "to
I ho penetrate the heavenly
Juriadiction bodies." With the com
munication were a dia
gram and an explanation of the partic
ular invention The diagram was full
of wheels, and it might have been in
ferred that the head of the petitioner
wis in a like condition. Anyway, Mr.
Kahn was puzzled over the matter. He
did not know what to do with the peti
tion. He did not want to offend his
constituent; neither could be offer such
a bill in congress, for he was aware
that it could not receive consideration.
A bright thought finally struck the
San Franciscan. He took his pen and
wrote: "I regret very much that I can
not comply with your request. Congress
has no jurisdiction over heavenly
bodies."
The senate was entertained with
spirited repartee the other day, in
which Mr. Beveridge of
Staying the Indiana and Mr. Bur
ton of Kansas were the
Floods principals, with Mr.
-- ý Hoar of Massachusetts
acting as a sort of final arixtrator.
The theme on which both Mr. Beve
eridge and Mr. Burton spoke with some
heat was irrigation in general and the
staying of floods in particular. They
had divergent ideas, which were dem
onstrated in voluminous speaking. The
Kansas man had a turn and advanced
two distinct and separate propositions.
"In one of his statements the senator
is correct," remarked Mr. Beveridge;
"in the other he is not correct."
Mr. Burton hesitated a moment to
take in the effect of the utterance. "I
am glad to know I got one right," he
said finally.
"So am I, and surprised." retorted
Mr. Beveridge.
This time Mr. Burton did not pause
so long, but quick as a flash exclaimed:
"The senator is always surprised if
any one except himself is right."
At this point Senator Hoar rose and
gazed benignly through his spectacles
at the disputants.
"The gentlemen." said he in the calm
est tones, enforcing the fact that the
senators had been disputing for a very
long time, "are talking about the im
possibility of staying the floods and
themselves giving the best possible
illustration of the truth of it."
A titter went round the chamber and
the debate proceeded on more serious
lines.

Thoma. Nelson sage, the Ben
Nelson ?age lucky novelist; now

ton. It happened in this way:
A few weeks age Mr. Burkett entered
a Pullman car, being on route from
Chicago, and sat, down in the Ebrary
thereof. Senator Simon of Oregon was
there, engrossed in a book. Several
other members of one or the other
branch of congress were present and a
gentleman unknown to the Nebraskan.
Senator Simon finally cease9 reading
and engaged in the general conversa
tion, which turned to books ou the re
construction period.
"Far and away thetest production of
that era in our history is 'Red Rock,
observed Mr. Burkett. "It is a wonder
ful book. Owas charmed with it.'
Soon thereafter Mr. Burkett went
back into another h'ullman &ir* but
was accosted by a porter with an In
quiry from Senator Simon as to wheth
er he would like to meet Mr. Thomas
Nelson Page. The unknown man to
Mr. Burkett was indeed the author of
"Iced Rock,' who was clearly pleased
with the young congressman's sincere
though unconscious compliment, and
the two apparently ?dad a oer- an
genial meeting.
When Secretary ody was tn "dry
&ock" recently undergoing repairs
made necessary by the accident at An
napolis, in which he was badly injured,
he denied himself to callers and in
structed his servant, a colored man
who attended the front door, to say
that he was not in.
One evening, so goes the story rust
told in the senate cloakroom; President
Roosevelt desir
ed to see the
secretary of the
navy and,
knowing that
he was confin
ed to his bache
lor apartments,
went over to
the I street
residence to
call.
Ringing the
secretary's bell,
the president
was greeted
with this state
ment of the col
ored man at
the door:
"Mr. Moody
am not in."
"MR. MOODY AM NOT IN." "But I just
telephoned, and they said the secretary
was in," exclaimed the president.
"Well, he am not in." repeated the
servant.
"But he must be in." the president
persisted.
The colloquy resulted in the conclu
sion that the servant did not know the
distinguished caller. and Mr. Roosevelt
said, with some impatience:
"I know he is in. Tell him the presi
dent wants to see him."
"De president ob what?" asked the
suspicious servant.
"The president of the United States,"
replied Mr. Roosevelt.
"Oh," remarked the servant as he
opened wide the door. "de secretary
am here. Walk right in. sir."
"The servant was right, Mr. Presi
dent," said Mr. Moody as he cordially
welcomed the nation's chief executive.
