Arnold and Andre.
[Chicago Tribmvoal
The John Carter Brown Library, in
Providence, RH. I., contains a "His
tory of the Origin. Progress and Ter
nuination of the American War," by
Stedman, an officer in the English ar
my. This particular copy of the book
[ once belonged to Sir Henry Clinton,
who conducted the negotiations with
Benedict Arnold, and sent out Major
Andre to confer with the traitor. His
comment on Stedman's account of the
attempt to betray West P.oint into
the hands of the British is:.' Igno
rance of the whole' transaction-too
tender a subject to explain upon now."
By the time he finished fling the
book, however, he seqems t )ive de
cided to record what ad to him
a fair statement of thecase. The fly
leaves at the end of the second vol
nine contain this curious record, which
hasjust been published for the 'first
time:
Arnold opened negotiations with
Clinton in 1780. He said that the al
liance with France had disgusted
him, and that he would, on this ac
count, go over to the British, provi
ded he was guaranteed personal se
curity and idemnity for any loss of
property he might sustain. Sir Henry
was "liberal" in his promises. He
got from Arnold, on several occasions,
"most material intelligence," and
finally, at the latter's request, sent
Andre to meet him on neutral ground.
At this time Clinton was still ancer
Stain whether his correspondent was
really Major.Geheral Arnold. Sev
' eral meetings were planned, but each
one was prevented by some enexpect
ed circumstance. Finally, on Arnold's
suggestion, Andre visited West Point
. under a flag of truce. He had been
charged by Clinton "not to change
dress or name on any account," and
to carry no suspicious papers." If
this thmn had been carried out, An
dre would have i"curred no risk what.
ever. But Arnold, either for some
.unknown reason, or because he lost
his presence of mind for the moment,
persuaded or compelled iis visitor to
disguise himself aiudnpass through the
Amnerican hilies with only a passport l
and his wits to protect him. Both
resources failed. Arnold, when he
heard of Andre's arrest, fled to New'
York, and carried the news to Cliin
ton. The latter was grieved, but
supposed that his friend would soon
be exchanged. He was horrified when
"Mr. Washington's" Council of War
condemned Andre to death. His
having landed under a flag of truce,
at the request of Arnold, and his
having assumed a disguise and taken
a false passport at the instance of the
latter, are urged in his curious docu
ment as reasons why hds,li+c should
have been spared. This is not very
conclusive reasoning, butbetter could
not be expected from such a warm
friend as Clinton. He enis his note
by saying that his heart will "never
cease to bleed" at the thought of
Andre's fate. Much as we may de
plore the untimely death af a gallant I
gentleman, whose judges grieved
over the sentence they hid to pro- I
aounce, it can scarcely te semionsty
'denied that the use of a flag of truce,
Iqder the circumstance o, nly ag- i
gravated thie guilt of the qpy 'wiho was I
caught with the written 1hoofs of his
crime concealed upon is person. IHe
was a good man, idd a brave man,
and a smart maim, but another spy of
ithe Americps irevolution was gleat
r or than .e. Andre, hungfor his share
in a plot to.corrupt a soldier, can not
be compared with Iathsu Hale, a
legitinitte spy, whose work had noth. I
t uog vile about it, and who went to
the scaffold regtresting that. he could
give onlhyone life for is soultry.

The South and the bentennial
Oath.,
IFrom the New Orleans Piasyune.
The publicati6n of (3v. Smith's
letter to Secretary Fish his led to the
, production of Secretary ish's reply.
It appears from the Secretary's state
I ment that there were.two kinds of
oaths provided-one for tie north and
one' for the bouth-anu arrangement '
admirably adapted :to 'discrioinate
Ibetween the aeutions, sad to keep
alive the. memories of an elade I
'which the subnmission o ode side and I
the magnanimity of theother shoald
have combined to:disaiss forever.
Secretary Fish's explanation is thatI
some of his clerks in the horry of the
moiment edolosed in the 'ommissmons
litended for Veconsitrueuel Georgia
Sthe bath inteondied for theloyal' Nortih.
In oftleritagtant explastiona he ad- I
pips that distinctions' aldibeen 'o-. i
served snd that the 'itheiou States 1
were to have been receivedlun terms I
iadjusted wtha tiew .to illustrating
the distinction in asrnarkcd and con- j
spicuons a mnapguera posible. It i
evident tlit the drangenoents is uin-.
, pPers. totard the Soeth and un
true t6 tbhe ostensible spirit of 'the
Centennil' eelebration; and, whmith
or theb exorpcffed by the Seretary
spran. fiom 'a: aftertlo ila t ol eal
j ly r6iretsditea an existing ttite of
- things, the fact remuains that the South
must go to . tSe Ceuteanial with a
Ssenseu oftbdimg disriminated agiinst
aend the khowledge that this dicrinm
. ination is pa'aded to the world.
It maybetrue that the movers in I
the centennial concern are talking of
Heon; L. Q. ;C. Ladde and Gen. Joseph I
E. Johnston aspromiueit aeors in
ceremonies of thpday, but we doubt
whether they or any other Southern
genotleaen carb lrnalde 'to' res

Bverfted to pasani ends as this

perioql of the war. No eracan oaut
er the sense of gladness and relief
with which they recognized the ap
proach of a better mutual understand
ing and a better mutual esteem. No
" words can describe the heartfelt
pleasure with which they look for
ward to the Centennial anniversary
as the fittest and most auspicious
time to celebrate the advent of the
new union while they commemorated
the glories of the old. But the spirit
that crops out in this oath-the spirit
manifested, first in prescribing any
special oath at all, and secondly in
framing it with such open purpose to
insult and humiliate the South-that
spirit is no answer to fraternal im
pulses awakening in the Southern
=heart.
Mr. Lamar may consent to speak
there and General Johnston may be
asked to serve among the dignitaries;
but we doubt if all this will offset the
bitter disappointment it has given us
to find that there remains at the
North the wish to keep alive the ani
mosities of fourteen years ago and to
taunt us with the defeat we have
I borne so patiently and bravely. The
occasion will seem more an illustra
tion of sectional differences than a
memorial reunion of brothers, and
Louisiana will imitate Georgia in
holding it in sorrow and avoidance.
Shyster.
Some time ago a lawyer of Chicago
sued the editor of one of the dailies
of that city for libel beeause said pa
per had called him .a "shyster." Not
long afterwards one of the leading
dailies of St. Louis was sued for the
same reason. These suits have natu
rally created a great deal of curiosity
as to the true meaning of the word
"shyster." The standard dictiona
ries are silent upon the subject; but
not so the famous Josh Billings, who
supplies the great need now felt by a
carious public. His definition of
"shyster" is as follows:
The shyster is a loose cross between
the Jeremy Didler and the ded-beat,
and is more partikularly known as a
cheap lawyer who hangs around the
arenas of justiss, a pest tow all who
know him, and a downright misfortin
tew those who don't. He is always
on hand tow help the unfortunate out
or one disaster into a wuss,one, and I
don't hesitate tew take the last shil- I
ling ennybody has got as pay for ser
vices that he knows he kant render. I
He is a vehement liar and prating
cheat; all decent lawyers despise I
him, and a judge dreds him as he
dun a drove ov hungry dies in a hot I
and fetid court-room.
A shyster is a kind of yell. dog
amtaug iumans, sneaking around the I
korners for a bone. He knose just I
enuuffabout law tow git a man into 1
its meshes, but never enuff tow git
him out, and never got a fee yet that I
hadn't the smell of hishonor in it.
He never gits ltbuv a shabby gen.
tility in his appearance, and would l
make a very good walking advertise- I
ment to parade in front or a second- I
hand clothing cousarn.
The shyster is always as poor as I
he is dishonest, and when he gits old
ari. fairly gone to seed, it takes all
the kunning lie is master ov tow git
his klam soup and his ockashuiual
luxury or cheap whisky.
Josh says I know several of this
infamous breed of kritters; I kan kall
up tow ni vishun at enny time tlheir
shiny black suits, their nnlighted
stuonps of cigars,, their koil glassy
ey'es, their pinched cheeks, and their
general hungryness.
If i was in a tite spot, and must
have help i had match rather meet a
highwayman than one of theeo
wretches.
Highwaymen are often generous1
have been known tow be teender, sel
dam are mean, but a shyster is cer
tainly the moast bitter ov all.blister.

AN INDIAN HRtMIT. - Marchant t
Kelly, a man well-known throughout 1
many of an eastern and central conn
tries of the State, died at his place
this morniug, at the age of sixty-four 1
Syear.. Mr. Kelly was a strange char- I
acter. He was a man ofconsiderable
cultinre for one whose youth extended I
back into tihe pioneer period of the
country, and at that early day was
actively engaged as a schlool-teacher. 1
lior many years he had lived the life
of a hermit, occupying a honse en-I
tirely alone, cooking his own victuals, I
making his own clothing and practi
cally demonstrating, as far as he was 1
able, that womamkmnd is a superfluity.
He was best known through his re. I
gion as a dentist, and, unlike the I
generality of Ihiscraft ulways carried
his office with him, and operated I
upon Ihis patients at their homes. His
traveling was done almost entirely
on foot, no nmatter what might be the I
P distance; and there is probably not I
I a person in the State that has walked
Sas great an aggregated number of 1

years, "Mart," as he was familiarly
called, developedl an intense hostility

Chufas.
I notice some inquitice in the Plan
tation of the Chufas, its habits, cni
ture, etc. Some twenty years ago i
received five seed from the Pater=:
Office, and have planted them ever
since. They are a "grass nut," bma
not a "nut grass." The nut grows tt,
the size of a small goober, and I have
frequently made a quart from a sin
gle nut. I have never tried them oa
very rich land, and do not know'
how great a yield might be got frot
themt ; but it would be enormous. On
land that will make twenty bushels o"
corn, one haudred bushels of ebhfas
can be ra'ised easily, and one bushel
of chufas is worth two of corn, as I
! will demonstrate. The clhtfas de
light in a light sandy soil, but will
grow in any soil. They may be
planted any time from December to
April, as they never rot in the groaun
or are injured by cold or frost. I am
now planting fire acres in theor
(:(March 8). I plowed the land smooth.
and laid open shallow furrows two
feet apart, and in this furrow drop a
single seed twelve inches apart, and
cover with a board. The seed will
vegetate the first warm weather, and
soon show a green line along the row.
As soon as the grass and weeds be
gin to grow, run a sweep between the
tows, the green spires begin to multi
ply, and will eventually meet across
the rows, each spire having a nut at
the bottom in the ground. The nuts
do not grow more thian two inches is
tihe ground, and the hogs fatten on
them in the winter when all other
crops are in the jut or barn. This is
a great advantage overall other crops
-no digging or storing. Poultry are
very fond of thema, and soon learn to
scratch for them, and as they grow
so near the surface, find no diffiaculty
in getting them. It is said the pecu
liar flavor of the canvas back duck,
of the Chesapeake, is derived from
the wild qelery they feed upon, but
epicures can have no conception of
delicious game or poultry unless they
