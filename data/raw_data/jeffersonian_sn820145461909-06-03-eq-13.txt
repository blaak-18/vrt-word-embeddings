WORTHINGTON BIBBS
represents an English
syndicate that has re
cently established a num
ber of saw-mills near the
imaginary line running
between Arkansas and the
Indian Territory. Several
days ago, while Mr. Bibbs
was attempting to go, on
B.
horseback, from one mill
to another, he lost his way in the
deep tangled wildwood,” and, after
many hours of blind wandering, came
upon an old fellow sitting on a log.
His face wore an expression of com
ical laziness.
“Ah, my good man,” said Bibbs,
“will you tell me the road to one of
the Albion saw-mills?”
“Which one?” the old fellow ask
ed, looking up and squinting at the
Englishman.
“Oh, it makes no difference what
ever, I assure you.”
“Then I don’t reckon it makes any
difference which road you take.”
“Ah, now, you are very, very
amusing.”
‘‘Yas, so is a frog.”
“Well, now, really, I never noticed
that, but since you have mentioned
it, I doubt not that you are right.
There are a great many things in
nature that we never really notice
until our attention is called to them,
you know.”
“Yas, an’ that’s whut the circuit
jedge ’lowed, but the gran’ jury kep’
on a-fetchin’ in the indictments.”
“Ah,” said the Englishman, ad
justing his eyeglass and giving the
squatter a searching look of inquiry.
“Reckon it is,” said the squatter.
“Beg pardon, but what did you
say?”
“W’y, you ’lowed ‘ah,’ an’ I say I
reckon it is.”
“Yes, ah, very amusing, I assure
you. Now, will you tell me the way
to ither one of those mills?”
“Ain’t got time.”
“Why, it would not take long, I
assure you.”
“Wall, es you know more about it
than I do, you’d better go on.”
“Well, now, really, this is extra
ordinary.”
“Yas, that’s whut the jedge ’lowed,
but the jury fotched in a verdict of
guilty.”
“Well, well, you are the most
amusing man I ever met, but I do
wish you would give me the infor
mation I seek. Which road shall I
take?”
“Do you see any road?”
“No, I —”
“Wall, then, how air youvgoin’ ter
take it?”
“Upon my word, you are exceed
ingly peculiar. How long have you
lived in this community?”
“Come here when Nan was a ba
by.”
“How old is Nan? permit me to
“Wall, es she hadn’t died she’d ’a’
been older than Betsy.”
“Pray tell me how old Betsy is?”
“Not quite as old as Nan would
’a’ been.”
“Upon my word, you are an ex
traordinary man. You are a farmer,
I presume.”
“Kain’t say I am.”
“What is your calling, then?”
“Call hogs sometimes, an’ some
times I don’t call nothin’.”
“What do you do for a living?”
“Eat sometimes, an’ then ag’in I
drink.”
“Well, I must say you are the
most peculiar man I ever met.”
“Neenter say it unless you want
to. Ain’t nobody a-shovin’ you.”
“Well, well,” said the English
man, giving him another searching
look, “I am somewhat interested in
you.”
“Yas, that’s what the wild turkey
said when she picked up the June
bug.”
“Ha, ha, quite a fable, I assure
you. But come, now, tell me the
way to the mill.”

By Opie Read
“Which one?”
“Ither.”
“What’s that?”
“I say ither.”
“Reckon you’d better go on. Man
come ’round here last fall an’ said
ither, an’ the fust thing he know’d
he’d done run away with a hoss.”
“Well, did I ever hear the like!”
“Don’t know as you have. Don’t
know what you’ve hearn. Ain’t nev
er run with you none.”
“Well, now, joking aside”—
“Ain’t jokin’ a side nur a back,
nuther.”
“Well, then, aside from joking,
will you tell me the way to ither one
of those mills?”
“Come around some other time.
I’m busy now.”
“Look here, my good fellow, you
are getting to be provoking.”
“Yas, that’s wut the lizard ’lowed
when the sag-log was drug over
him.”
The Englishman sought an easier
position in his saddle, looked at the
squatter, frowned perplexedly and
then said:
“I have come here for the good of
the community. I”
“Whur air you frum?”
“London, England.”
“Which side of the railroad is it
•on?”
“Well, upon my soul!”
For several minutes afterward the
Briton could say nothing more, and
during his silence he seemed to be
wondering whether or not to pro
claim the old fellow a fool. After
awhile, appearing to have resolved to
make another effort, he said: “I
have come here for the good of the
community and really deserve better
treatment, even at the hands of an
irresponsible native.”
“Reckon you’ll make more money
outen the neighborhood than I will,”
the squatter replied. “You come in
here and crowd the neighborhood.”
“Crowd the neighborhood?” the
Englishman exclaimed.
“Yas, that’s whut you air doin’.
All my life I have been crowded.
Some time ago I lived way over yan
der” (waving his arm). “Was gif
tin’ along fust-rate till one mornin’
I woke up an’ found that another
fellow had moved in.”
“He didn’t move into your house?”
“No, but he settled down not
more’n five mile frum me an’ skeered
the deer. I went to him an’ axed
him ter apologize, an’ he wouldn’t
do it, an’ then, ruther then ter be
crowded, I left.”
“I must say that you are the most
amusing man I ever saw.”
“Then I don’t reckon you know’d
my brother Bill.”
“I did not.”
“Wall, now, he was amusin’, sho
nuff. Es you ain’t in a hurry, I’ll
tell you about him.”
“I am prepared to hear anything,
I assure you.”
“All right. Wall, one day me and
brother Bill was out at the sto’, an’
a feller that was readin’ suthin out
en a paper, an’ the drift of it was
that Governor Henry was the strong
est governor the State ever had. Bill
didn’t say nothin’, but I seed that
he was worried, an’ that night, after
he went to bed, Bill he says, ‘Alf’—
that’s me—‘did you hear that feller
read outen the paper that Governor
Henry is the strongest governor the
State ever had?’ I ’lowed that I did.
‘Wall,’ says he, ‘I don’t like fur that
sort of thing ter be flung ’round yo’
uncle Fuller’—meanin’ him —‘fur
you know I’m the strongest man thar
is anywhar in this State, an’ es Hen
ry thinks he’s the strongest, w’y, he’s
got to prove it, that’s all! I axed
him what he was goin’ ter do, an’ he
’lowed that he wanted me ter go
down ter Little Rock with him an’
see the governor. I agreed, an’ the
next mornin’ we hitched up ole Tom
an’ the gray mar’ that we got frum
the Posey boys, an’ away we went.
We was about three days on the
road, but that didn’t make no dis-
Bfoe Jeffersonian
funce, fur Bill he had a good deal at
stake, an’ you bet I was with him.
Wall, we got thar at last an’ found
out whar the governor roosted, an’
we went thar. I was sorter skittish,
but brother Bill he wa’n’t, for he
walked right up and axed a nigger
whar the governor was. Then the
nigger he grinned an’ wanted to
know our names, an’ then Bill shoved
him aside and walked right in, an’ I
went with him, for I was with Bill
world without eend. We found the
governor a-settin’ with his feet up
on the table, an’ as soon as I laid
eyes on him I seed that a mistake
hed been made, fur he was lean an’
dried-up an’ wa’n’t a patchin’ com
pared ter Bill, an’ he looked like he
was sorry fur it, too; but that didn’t
make no diffunce to Bill, for he says,
says he, ‘Governor, I I’arn through
the papers that you air the strongest
governor the State ever had, an’ I
don’t believe it, an’ I stand here to
take the part of old Governor Ful
ton, that was the friend of my gran’-
daddy, an’ you bet he could lift more
at a handspike than you can any day,
an’ I want you to understand it, an’,
fu’thermore, I want you to know that
lam after you right now.’ Wall, the
governor sorter laughed, an’ says,
‘Bill, I know you air a putty good
man, an’ I’ll try you a few falls put
ty soon, but before we go into it let’s
try a little of this juice, the oldest
you ever seed.’ Wall, Bill he took
his tobacker outen his mouth, an’ the
gov’nor tuck down a jug, an’ then we
all hit it, an’ we kep’ on a-hittin’ it
till after while me an’ Bill found it
as much as we could do to stand up.
But the gov’nor kep’ on a-smilin’ an’
Another Year of Defeat for the
American Saloon
(Concluded from last week)
On February 17 last there was in
corporated into the penal code of the
United States the Interstate Liquor
Shipment Bill, introduced by Repre
sentatives Humphreys, of Mississip
pi, and Miller, of Kansas.
It is considered by many the
most important temperance legisla
tion since the passage of the Wilson
law in 1890. This bill does three
things: (1) It prohibits C. O. D.
shipments; (2) it prohibits delivery
to fictitious consignees; (3) it re
quires that all packages of liquor
for inter-state shipment shall be
plainly marked, designating the con
tents and consignee. The bill was in
grave danger, and would have been
killed in the committee had it not
been that Speaker Cannon obstinate
ly demanded its passage, and then
voted for it upon the floor. This
law, while it will not do all that the
friends of temperance might desire,
will go a long way toward correcting
the abuse that the liquor dealers
have practiced upon the citizens of
the State that have prohibited the
drink traffic, and will pave the way
for further relief which the people of
the States may demand in the fu
ture.
The Saloon “Fighting for Its life.”
Almost all of the legislatures meet
ing during the present year have had
bills relating in some way to the
liquor traffic. Very few of these
bills showing any friendliness to the
saloon have been allowed to become
laws. A recent editorial in Benfort’s
Wine and Spirit Circular, written by
T. M. Gilmore, the president of the
National Model License League, ex
presses the opinion of many liquor
dealers upon the present temperance
revolution. It says:
The Anti-Saloon League is backed
by able men and plenty of money.
In the last eighteen months the busi
ness we represent has been outlawed
in the States of Oklahoma, Georgia,
Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina
and Tennessee, and it is now facing
destruction in West Virginia, Texas,
Kentucky, Arkansas, Utah and Idaho.
The saloon is fighting for its life in
practically every State in the Union.
The liquor dealers strenuously in-
a-pourin’ it out, an’ finally brother
Bill he says, ‘Governor, I reckon that
thing they printed about you was the
truth. lam your friend, for I reck
on you air stronger’n me.’ And Bill
he drapped, an’ I drapped, an’ the
governor he smiled and said he reck
on it was about time he was pardon
in’ a feller that had stol’d a set of
harness. An’ so he did. Me an’ Bill,
soon as we was able, come”—
“What became of that remarkable
man?” the Englishman asked.
“Wish you hadenter axed me that,
fur it makes me sad. He fell in a
sink-hole, an’ me an’ pap found him
shortly afterwards. The hole was
putty deep, but down thar stood
Bill.”
“You got him out, of course,” said
the Englishman.
“Wall, let me tell you. As I tell
you, me an’ pap found him, an’ was
just about to let down a rope to
draw him out, when one of the dogs
treed a coon. Wall, we ’lowed that
Bill would stay thar, an’ we didn’t
know whuther the coon would er
not; so we went after the coon, an’
when we come back we found that
the sink-hole had caved in on Bill.
We would ’a’ dug him out, but pap—
a mighty smart man, too—’lowed
that it wa’n’t no use to dig him out
jest ter bury him ag’in, so we let him
stay. Say, stranger, you axed me es
I would tell you the way ter one of
them mills. Wall, you keep on
a-goin’, an’ es you don't come ter
one of them you come back here an’
call me a liar, an’ I’ll take it like a
lamb fakin’ tender grass in the spring
of the year. Good-by.” i
sist that “prohibition does not pro
hibit,” and their literature, which is
scattered broadcast among the
church people, as well as others,
claims the failure of the prohibitory
laws in the States having tem. They
insist that the more the traffic is pro
hibited the more liquor is consumed,
and that hypocrisy and disrespect for
law are fostered, and yet the States
that have adopted prohibition seem
to be very well pleased with their
legislation, and none of them have
surrendered to license, and other
States in pretty rapid succession are
joining their ranks. In Maine, Kan
sas and North Dakota at their last
election governors were chosen on
platforms not only declaring for
State-wide prohibition, but for a
rigid enforcement of the prohibitory
law; while in Georgia, Oklahoma and
Alabama the anti-saloon forces have
held their own, preventing legislation
which would in any way weaken the
State prohibitory laws.
Strength of Economic Argument.
No great result can come from a
small cause. There are powerful
causes that are putting the saloon
out of business. More and more the
economic argument is influencing
voters to abolish the saloon. The
man who frequents the saloon is not
so strong in body nor intellectually
so keen, nor professionally or indus
trially so efficient as the man who
does not. A man who has no scru
ples on the subject, but has good
common sense soon discovers that he
is handicapped in the heated compe
tition of life when he becomes a pa
tron of the saloon.
The New York Central, the Lacka
wanna, the Pennsylvania, the Balti
more and Ohio, the Wabash, the
Rock Island, the Great Northern, and
other railroad systems have adopted
the following rule: “The use of in
toxicants by employees, while on du
ty, is prohibited. Their habitual
use, or the frequenting of places
where they are sold, is sufficient
cause for dismissal.” The Michigan
State law will not permit a man who
is not a total abstainer to have any
thing to do with the runnig of trains.
