The President's Message.
We have before as the full text of
the President's proclamation to Con
gress which met on Monday last, but
it is too lengthy for us to lay be
fore our readers this week; we con
tent ourselves with the following
brief synopsis and extract in regard
to Louisiana.
He first alludes to the general
prostration of business and attrib
utes it to the debt abroad incurred
in the prosecution of the war. He
urges the return to a specie basis at
once or aa soon as possible without
unnecessary delay, and he is down
on an inflated currency. He says
that our relations with mo t of the
foreign governments is satisfactory.
The treaty with Belgium ends 1875,
our relations with China continue to
be friendly. ' All claims awarded bv
the Mixed Commission were paid
September 21st. He recommends
that Congress recognize Cuba as a
belligerent. He pays some attention
to the status of naturalized citizens.
It will be observed from the report
of the Secretary of the Treasury that
the amount of receipts over expendi
tures has Ireen but $2 ,844,882.30 for
the fiscal year ending June 30th
1874 and that for tlte current fiscal
year the estimated receipts over ex
penditures will not much exceed $!).
000.000. It then becomes necessary
either to reduce expenditures or in
crease receipts to provide for the
sinking fund to pay the large nation
al debt The Navy has been re
paired, new ships built, the iron clads
put upon a war footing and every
thing is ready for war.
And then comes Louisiana and the
Southern States, as follows:
Your attention will be drawn to the un
settled conriition of affaira in some of the i
Sontliern States. On the 14th of Septem
ier last, tbe Governor of Louisiana called,
upon me, as provided by the Constitution
and laws of the United States, to aid
suppressing domestic violence iu that
State. This call was made iu view of a
proclamation issued on that (lay by D B.
Penn, claiming that he was elected Lieu
tenant Governor in 1872, and calling upon
ihe militia of the State to arm, assemble
and drive from power the usurpers as ho
designated the officers of the State Govern
ment.
Ou tho next day I issued my proclama
tion commanding the insurgents to <lis
perse within five days from the «lute there
of, and subsequently learned that on that
day they had taken forcible possession of
the State House. Steps were, taken by me
to support the exifting and recognized
State Government, but before the expira
tion of the five days the insurrectionary
movement was practically abandoned anil
the officers ot the State Government, with j
some minor exceptions resumed their pow
ersand duties.
^Considering t,ha"t the present Slatead-lvey
ministration of Louisiana has been the on
ly government in that State for nearly two
years; that it has been tacitly acknowl
edged and acquiesced iu as such by Con
gress and more than once expressly recog
nized by me, I regarded it as my clear du
ty, when legally called upon for that pur
pose, to prevent its overthrow by an arm
. I
ed mob, under pretend of fraud and irreg-|of
ularity in tho election of 1872.
I have heretofore called the attention of |
Congress to this subject, stating that, on
account of the frauds and forgeries com
mitted at that election, and because it ap
pears that the returns thereof were never
" j
thereby who were chosen; bnt from tin
best sources of information at my command
legally canvassed, it was impossible to tell ;
"
1 b av e always believed the present State j
officers received a majority of the le
votes actually cast at that election
1 repeat what. I said iu my special mes
sage of February "20tli, 187:$, that, in the
event of no action by Congress, I must con
tinue to recognize tlie government hereto
fore recognized by me.
I regret to say that with preparations
for the late elections decided indications
appeared in some localities in the .Southern
States of » determination, by acts of vio
lence and intimidation, to deprive citizens
of the freedom of tho baliot because of
their political opinions.
Bknds of men, masked and armed, made
their appearance; white leagues and other
societies were formed ; largo quantities of
arms and ammunition were imported and
distributed to these organizations ; milita
ry drills with menacing demonstrations
were held; and with all those, murders
enough were committed to spread terror
among those whose political action was to
be suppressed, if possible, by these iutol
eraut and crimiual proceedings
In some places colored laborers were
compelled to vote according to the wishes
of their employers, under threats of dis
charge if they acted otherwise, and there
are too many instances in which, when
these threats were disregarded, thoy wore
remorselessly executed by those who made
them. I understand that the Fifteenth
Amendment to the Constitution was made
to prevent this and like state of things,
and tlie act of May 31, If70, with amend
ments, was passed to enforce its provis.ons
The object of both being to guarantee to
all citizens tho right to vote and to pro
tect them iu the free enjoyment of that
right.
Enjoined by the Constitution "to take g
care that the laws be faithfully executed," |
and convinced by undoubted evidence that, is
violations of said act had been committed,
"iîîûî?** "I 1 !: :
contemplated, tbe proper oflicers were in
Htructea to prosecute tho offender», and m
troops were stationed at convenient points

plaints are made of this interference by
Federal authority, but if said amendment
nnd act do not provide fur ttuch interfer

lorce or effect, and the whole scheme of ;
colored enfranchisement is worse than
iniinlrArc ïln.1 litfl.t liettfir t.limi a nriinn
mockery and little better than a crime
Possibly Congress may find it due to
truth and justice to ascertain by means of
committee, whether the alleged wrongs

are real or the repot ts thereof "Were inauu-1

The whole number of troops in the States!

Carolina. North Carolina, Kentucky, Ten

uessee, Arnansas Mississippi, Indiana and
Virginia at the time of the election, were ^

/otla fro» the D*l«wm to lb* Gulf.
He then reviews the" contest in
Arkansas as follows :
Another trouble lias arisen in Arkan
sas. Articles 13 of the constitution of
that State (which was adopted in
1868, anil upon tlie approval of which
by Congress the State was restored t" :
representation as one of the States ot
representation
the Union), provides, in effect, that be
fore any amendments proposed to this
constitution shall become a part there
of they shall he passed by two succes
sive Assemblies add then submitted to
and ratified by a majority of the elec
tors of the State voting thereon.
On the 11th May, 1874, the Governor
convened an cxtaa session of the Gen
eral Assembly of the State, which, on
the 18th of same month passed an act
providing for a convention to frame a
new constitution, pursuant to this act,
and at elecion held on the 30th June.
1874, tho convention was approved and
delegates were chosen thereto who as
sembled on the 14th of last July and
formed a new constitution, the sched
ule of which provided f<»r the election
of au entire new set of State oflicers,
in a manner contrary to the then ex
isting election laws of the State. On
the 13th October, 1874, the constitu
tion, as therein provided, was sub
mitted to the people for their approval
or rejection, rnd according to the elec
tion returns was approved by a large
majority of those qualified to vote
thereon, and at the same election per
sons were chosen to fill the State,
county and township offices. The Gov
ernor elected in 1872 for the, term of
four years turned over his office to the
Governor chosen under the new Con
stitution. Whereupon the Lieutenant
Governor, also elected in 1872 for a
term of four years, claiming to ac t as
Governor and alleging that said pro
ceedings by which the new
Coustitu-I
tion was made and a new set of officers
elected were unconstitutional, illegal |
and void, and called upon me as provi
ded in section 4, articles 4 of the Con
stitution, to protect the State against j
i domestic violence.
As Congres is now investigating the
political affairs of A iUansas, I hav 1
affairs of a State is repugnant to
public opinion, to :he feelings ol
those who from their official capacit
J
declined to interfere. 7 he whole
jeefc <»f Executive iut<u'fi?reucf! with tiie
• . :
must he used in such interposition ami
to humor those who must . Ii. m (?)
Uu!ess most clearly on the side of law.
such interferance becomes a crime,
\\ ith the law to support, it is condom -
ed without a hearing. I desire, there
fore, that all necessity for Executive
direction iu local affairs may become
unnecessary and obsolete.
I invite llie
„ ...
j 1 - ' .
I invite llie attention not. of Con
gross, but or the people of the United
States, to the causes ami effets of
these unlfappv^quesrions. Is there not
4»n one side to bel i;tie
them or justify them ? If public opin
ion could be directed to a correct sur
of what it is, and to rebukin;
wrong and aiding the prop r authori
ties iu punishing it, a better state
feeling would be incalcnated, and the
sooner we would have that peace which
would leave the States free indeed lo
I regulate their own domestic affairs.
I believe on the part of our citizens
the Southern States, the better part
of them, there is a disposition to bei
| l;iw abiding and to do no violence
Litl, cr to individuals or to laws exist
But do they do right, in ignoring
j existence of violence and bloodshed in
; resistent'« to constituted authority. I
sympathize with their prostrate condi
tion and would do all in my power to
j relieve them. Acknowledging that in
some instances they have had most
trying government to live under and
very oppressive, ones in (lie way of!
taxation lor nominal improvement, not!
giving benefits equal to tho liardshij
imposed.
lînt can they proclaim themselves
entirely irresponsible /or this condi
Hon t Tliey cannot. Violence has
been rampant in some localities, an
has either been justified or denied bv!
those who could have prevented it
ihe theory is even raised that there,,
is to be no further interference on the
part of the General Government to
protect citizens iu a State where the
authorities fail to give protection.
This is a great mistake. While 1 re
main Executive all the laws of Con
gress and the provisions of the Consti
tution, including the recent amend
ments added thereto, will be enforced'
with vigor, but with regret that they
Id have added one iot or title to
Executive duties or powers. Let there
be fairness in the discussion of South
ern questions ; the advocates of both']
or all political parties giving honest,
truthful reports of occurrences, con
dem ni h g the wrong and upholding the!
right, and soon all will be well.

* A Moral Lesson For Bad
Boys .—On Sunday last, our little
devil, Eichard Turner, went bird
hunting with some other bad boys
of an accident, the gnn of one of
his companions having gone off un
expectedly and inflicted the wound.
Now boys, bad boys? you see if
Richard had not gone hunting on
that Sunday morning and had been
at home diligently studying his
catechism he would not now be ly
ing in bed with his leg on a pillow
with a good prospect of lying there
for a month or more yet to come.
The tnoial we wish to teach ye bad
boys is not to go hunting on Sun
day, but if they are bound to go
anyhow, they must go alone. Don't
do as we do but. as we say boys ?

We do not believe Kellogg lias a sol
