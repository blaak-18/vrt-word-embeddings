OUR WASHINGTON LTTEIR.
WASHINGTON D. C., March 30,1878.
The original Jacobs--the man who
visited Mr. Hayes on Sunday night,
March 4, 1877, at John Sherman's
house, and then and there discovered
that Hayes was not all that Republi
can fancy painted him- is Senator
Hamlin. The words that Senator
Hamlin used on that occasion were
profane. He said, did Senator Ham
lin, "By G-d we're sold." I recall
this incident only because a couple of
Pennsylvania Republican Congress
man, after a year of experience sint
ular to what Hamlin had, are just
now affecting to be astonished at
something Hayes has done or failed
to do. It was a matter of an oflice
as, no doubt, was Ilamlin's--and this
leaves Mr. Hayes in March 1878 with
very much the same feelings as the
Senator did in March 1877. We may
expect that in 1880 the average Penn
sylvania radical Congressman will
understand things as fully as Hamlin
did after the 15 minutes conversation
with Hayes.
Montgomery Blair's resolution,
which passed the Maryland House
yesterday, instructs the Attorney
General of the State to exhibit a bill
to the Supreme Court of the United
States setting forth that by reason of
the fraudulent returns made from
other States and allowed to be counted
due effect was not given to the electo
ral vote of Maryland, and praying
the Court to make the revision con
templated by the electoral commis
sion law, and upon such revision de
clare that Hayes and Wheeler were
not, and Tilden and Hendricks were
elected President and Vice-President
of the United States.
This resolution has none of the ob
jectionable features of other suggest
ed measures for getting this case be
fore the Supreme Court. Such action
is, however, without precedent, and
the power of the Court to act on a
case of the kind, so brought to its at
tention, will be questioned, of course.
The House yesterday seated Dean,
Democrat, in place of Field, Republi
can, from Massachusetts. What made
the case specially noticeable was the
course of General Butler. He voted
for Dean, asserting that, under a bad
law enacted by Republicans, Dean
was entitled to the seat. He said the
law, made by Republicans to protect
Republicans, happened in this case to
aid a Democrat, and it was not the
less a law and ought to be lived up to.
There are several laws, on more im
portant subject, which have answer
ed the partizan purpose for which
they were passed, and which I expect
Republicans will yet wish to see re
pealed.
The feeling here appears to be that
the New Orleans Collectorship lies
between Packard and Anderson with
the chances in favor of the former.
But Mr. Hayes has a very curious
habit of listening attentively to all
that issaid of candidates, then making
his sclection from those who have not
been mentioned.
We all remember how the Moffett
bell-punch was laughed to scorn a
few months ago; but it seems to have
widely commended itself.by its prac
tical wotkings and has been'adopted
in two other Southern States, is before
the Albany Legislature, and is being
strongly arged for this District,
A would be Wisconsin Postmaster
manaced to call the President's at
tention particularly to his case by
sending him a map of his little bor
ough with his adherent's houses paint
adpink, those of "the other fellow"
yellow. The idea appears hardly
adopted to large towns of the size of
New York, for instance.

THE DRIFT OF PUBLIC SENTIXENT
The Country Press in Line For a
Straight.out Canvass.
ftbdes Democrat.-The people will not
only vote against this amendment, but
they will vote down every one of them
amdealla convention and make a new
sonstitution, which is theigperogative.
The Legislature in attempting wholesale
changes in an organic law are usurping a
privilege and right belonging exclusive
to the people and they will vote them
down anrebuke this arrogant body of
misrepresentatives. The Democrats vo
ting esa have but one hope of carrying
these amendments, and that is, that the
negro will vote solidly forthem, through
fear that a Constitutional Convention
would submit measures impairing some
of his political rights.
Ricland Beacos.-There will be a Dem
ooratio State Convention sometime this
summer-we have no idea when now
oestensibly, for the purpose of nominating
a candidate for the offce of 8tate Trease
ru but we had a hint already that the
riends of the proposed Constitutional
amendments and opponents of the Con
stitatioual Convention, purpose getting
control of the convention and incorpora
ting into tile platform resolutions recom
mending the adoption of the amendments.
Therefore we give the friends of the Con
stitutional Convention timely warning to
be on the lt sive when they come to se
lect delegates to this State Convention,
and to be sure that they select men who
will favor the adoption of altogether dif
ferent resolutions; resolutions opposing
the adoption of these amendments and
avonnin the calling of a constitutional
eonvenion.
We also warn thosem who oppose the
wishbee of a large majority of the people of
the States, that, if they do get control of
the convention and attempt to gag these
amendments down the Democratic vo
,s they will fail in their purpose, and
too, perhaps at the expense of the
defeat of the prty; for, so far as the voe
ters of this parish are concerned, they
will refase to obey any such instructions.
You may call this a captions revolt
saist paty discipline and policy, or
what you will, but we utter as poesitive
trath and mean just precisely what we
sy. Richland parih, without a pow
revolution in sentiment between
new and the day of election, is not going
to ets for the amadmenats, no matter who
reeommemns their adoption and no mat
tot what authority attempts to rule them
eat of the party. We have already
heard that prominent Democrats have
said no true Democrat opposed their
adopton. We are not to be frightened
by suh declarations. Our record is
? on that more. No one can impeach
Riebland parish or the editor of this pa
pet on that wore. Our history is too
well known and clear to admit of even a
asetpoim M to oar political soundness.

AMONG the FARMERS.
Country Roads.
A correspondent gives the following
timely suggestions and information in
regard to a subject that receives too
little attention in most districts:
The surface of a road is not to be
regarded as an arch to sustain the
weight of the vehicles passing over
it, but as a roof to protect the materi
al beneath. The road bed should be
thoroughly drained, else the road
can never be good. A loose sandy
road will be improved by a coat of
six inches of clay; this may be plac
ed on one-half of the road, leaving
the other half for summer gravel. In
like manner a coat of six inches of
sand on a clay road will be a materi
al improvement. The surface of a
road should slope six inches in ten
feet from the center line. The lines
of slope should be straight not curv
ed. The plow and scraper should
never be used on roads; their work
is great in quantity, but wretchedly
poor in quality. The plow breaks up
the surface, which by use has become
hard and passably smooth, and the
scraper brings in from the sides al
luvial soil and matter liable to decay.
All holes or depressions should he at
once filled up; the neglect of this is
the great fault in our system of road
repairing. A little work is done once
a year and the rest of the time the
road is left to take care of itself
Holes should not be filled with allu
vial matter or turf which, though at
first deceptibly tough, soon disinte
grates, and forms the worst sort of
mud. Nor should they be filled with
stone, which does not wear evenly
with the rest of the road, but leaves
it in lumps and ridges.-Ex.
Oranges Filled With Jelly.
Select large oranges, and from the
top of each remove with a sharp pen
knife a round piece the size of a
quarter; then, with the handle of a
teaspoon, take out the pulp, careful
not to break the rinds, and throw
them into cold water. Make jelly,
using gelatinet and the juice pressed
from the pulp, which should be
strained that. it may be quite clear;
color one-half of the jelly a bright
rose color with current jelly, wine, or
a small quantity of prepared cochi
neal. When the jelly is somewhat
cooled, drain and wipe the oranges
and fill them with alternate stripes
of the two colored jellies. Each color
must be allowed to set before the
other is poured in. When the orang
es are perfectly cold, cut them into
quarters with a very sharp knife, and
arrange tastefully in a glass dish with
sprigs of myrtle between them.
How to Increase the Flow of Milk.
A lady correspondent of a Southern
paper, writing from Arkansas, gives
the following recipe to increase the
flow of milk in a cow. She says:
"Tepid water, slightly salted, given
twice a day, wi11 increase the flow of
milk one-third; if the cow will not
drink it at first trial, scatter a hand
ful of bran or meal over the top of it.
They soon become very fond of it,
and will drink all you give them. I
tried this plan three years ago with
perfect success. I had only one coew,
and she was of the common scrub
stock ot the country, and after she
began to drink the water prepared as
above she furnished me twice a day,
two ordinary water-buckets full of
milk, and by feeding a little corn
boiled with cotton seed, the milk
yielded butter enough to supply my
table bountifully and leave me a few
pounds to sell every week. I gave
her three gallons of water twice a
day.
The American people are gradually
increasing the consumption of mot
too. Thirty years ago but few fat
sheep went to the markets. Now,
more than a million are required an
nually to supply the demands of New
York city alone. The great staple
meat food of the cities is beef, while
in the country districts it is the flesh
of swine., Farmers can not keep
whole carcasses of beef on hand, and
if preserved in salt, as they do their
pork, it soon gets hard and nopalata
ble. A carcass of mutton being so
much smaller, even in hot weather, a
considerable portion of it can be used
fresh and the balance pickled in salt.
Muttoo will keep longer in afresh.
state chan any other meat, and when
corned is equally nutritions with beef
and far more welcome than pig meat
in any form. For persons of sedantry
habits, and at all oflicted with weak
digestion, it is far healthier than beef
or pork. Many people who can not
digest either of tile latter without dis
tress, can eat mutton and experience
no unpleasantness whatever. It is
the cleanest and purest meat food in
the whole animnl kingdom, as a sheep
will starve before it will eat anything
dirty or tainted. Mutton wastes less
in the pot than beef. The bones are
lighter and finer in proportion to the
amount of meat in well-fed sheep,
and this, alone, is an important item
to those who have to buy. The less
shrinkage in cooking is a considerable
per centage in favor of mutton. The
great reason why more mutton is not
eaten is because of its poor quality
which is the result of no gen
eral system practiced in the produc
tion of this important staple.
Conveniences on a Farm.
The successful farmer is he who
provides conveniences for the care of
his property and the performances of
his work he counts time as an impor
tant item in the yearly calculation
and care of all his various effects as a
factor in the annual returns. When
lie puts the horse in tile stable there
is a place for the harness where it
will be safe from weather or any oth
er damage; his wagon and tools are
provided with coverings to preserve
them; about his premisses will be
found a little shop or room where he
keeps saws, hammers, vises, angers,
and the various tool that are needed
to mend and put in order the different
machines he uses. These simple ar
ticles prevent days and weeks of de
lay, besides adding to the length of
time implements will last. It pays
to have conveniences, and also to get
what you do buy of good quality.
