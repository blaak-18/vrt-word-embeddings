Let the winds and waves of ad

if they will; but keep on the path
of rectitude, and you will beas lirm

If gossip with her poisoned tongue
meddles with your good name, heed
her not. Carry yourself erect let
your course be straight-forward, and

little you.

"How romantic !"■ said Senator
Schurz, soto voice.
"Two young lovers !" said Mr.
Leflet, himself a bachelor of the
old school.
"Runaway couple, I'll be bound!"
said Major Gentry. "Hullo, young
man, how far is it to the village ?"
"Don't know," said the 'young
man.
"Stranger here ?" said the Major.
'\Ya-as," replied the young man,
hesitatingly.
"Where are you going ?" pursued
the Major.
"Shall I tell P inquired the
young man of the blushing damsel
at his Side.
"Oh, Charlie, I'm afeared !" said
the timid creature, clinging more
closely to him.
"Come, speak out, young man !"
said the Major kindly. "You need
not be afraid of us. We're looking
for shelter, too."
The young Romeo felt reassured.
"A\ aal," said he, "the truth on it
is, Mai y and I is going to find a
parson, and git married !"
"Runaway couple, eh ?"
"Waal—yes, sort o' somethin'
like that I s'pose. Mary's folks are
down on me an' they forbid my
courtiu' of her. We jess couldn't
stan' it no longer, Mary nor I !" So
we struck out for ourselves last
night, and here we are !"
"You aren't minors, are ye ?"
"I'm twenty-four, but Mary's on
ly jest turned seventeen."
"Only seventeen ?" Well, now
look here, my young friends, don't
you think you're doing a very fool
ish thing ? Wouldn't it be much
more honorable and satisfactory af
ter all to turn right about and go
home and tel! the old folks square
ly and fairly that you're bound to
marry and must have their con
sent; that you mean to try to make
life pleasant for one another, and
all that sort o' thing ? Tell 'em the
square truth, be honest with 'em."
This good advice was all for
naught. The young couple came
into the village hotel the next day,
and we knew by their blushes and
smiles and awkward manifestations
of real dslight that the parson had
done his work. The happy groom
drew the Major out one side and
whispered in his ear :
"Ef I'd ha' knowed last night
that you was the Ouvrier, mebbe I'd
ha' done what you told. But it's
too late now, and then, too, Mary's
'oiks is the d—dest old fools you
ever see !"

I he Brunswick philosopher thus
moralizes: Young man, you feel a
superiority to the whole human sice,
as you stand at the altar with your
fair young bride. You would not
change places with the President.
Yet a few short years, a few short
whiskings of broom-handles, au un
timely stoppage or two of wafted
flat-irons and your weary body will
ro.st under the swaying willow—
while some young gallant will bring
your late afflicted partner out to
the cemetery on calm Sabbath eve
nings, and whisper love in her ears,
as together they strew peanut shells
over your grave. ''Oh, why should
the spirit of mortal be proud."
