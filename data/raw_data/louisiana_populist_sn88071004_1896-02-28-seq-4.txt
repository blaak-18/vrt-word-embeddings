m- Various suggestions have been made
a fbr the improvement of the balloon.
in says a writer in the National Review.
enabling it to be efficient in windy
weather, but I determined at the outset
to do away altogether with that tie kl
)or and troublesome element, gas. Aerial
ed machines furnished with screw pro
ms pellers could doubtless be made to as
"it cend, but then, again, hea~vy transport
ng would be required to carry the engines
pry and fuel for working them. 'rhun my
thoughts soon turned to that simple
toy, the kite, end on that well-known
principle I based my new machine.
1t Thus the wind, which is so detriment tl
to to ballooning, now became my friend
tot and helpmate. Yet. let ume at once cx
iP. plain. I do not consider it an absolute
)0. necessity. As a schoolboy runs to get
co his kite to rise, so this aerial apparatus
may be towed by running men or
horses, and so caused to ascend in calm
weather. After somne years of experi
menting with small kites of all shan's
and forms, I increased the size till I
L- made one thirty feet high. At length
eY I arrived at a shape and adjustment of
tackle that practically removed all un
steadiness and liability to capsize. That
i- awkward appendage, the tail, was ili
s. carded, and by increasing the numbnler
is of kites, steadiness and ease of manipu
lation were increased. And now I think
the apparatus is at last approaching the
Spractical stage.
The latest machine consists cf a vary
ing number (usually four to six) of sails,
of of a flattened hexagonal shape. looking
not unlike the square sails of a ship.
These are connected, one behind the
ether. to the ground line, from which
latter is suspended a basket car. A
parachute is spread out above the car
in case of accident. The number of
kites used depends upon thel strength
of the wind, and thus the stronger ,he
pressure the less is the area present.ld,
so that the strain on the retaining ropes
Is always about the same. This appara
tus has now been tried on a number of
occasions and under many different cir
ctmstances of weather, ani although,
through lack of wind, or, rather, in
sufficiency of kite-power. It has occa
. sionally not lifted as well as I should
like, and frequently mishaps, the re
suits of inexperience, have occurred,
yet. on the whole, it has behaved very
well, and has generally carried its man
easily and steadily to a considerably
height. I have myself been lifted over
100 feet high. and had I not been firmly
held down by a rope I might have risen
much higher. Never once have I ex
perienced the least uncomfortable mo
tion. When the car has been let up to
the full extent of the rope, equivalent
to a height of some 400 feet. it has in
variably floated steadily and well. The
ropes and tackle have, with a few ex
ceptions easily remedied, always stood
their work well. and those seeing the
Y apparatus for the first time have gen
erally expressed surprise at its ease and
steadiness.
Strange Phasuo.
It is rumored that bicycles are to take
on strange phases. In England a front
driving wheel of low stature is much
in use. It is really a descendant of the
high bicycle, as it discards the chain
and uses, as did that big affair, the front
wheel for both driving and steering.
Its admirers claim many advantages
for it, its chief one being its very light
weight. A twenty-one inch machine,
geared to a fifty-seven inch frame, with t
full roadster equipments, does not
weigh more then twenty-three pounds.
The new whel is easier to learn to ride,
it Is claimed, than the rear driver,
though persons accustomed to that
would find the change awkward at first. a
Although the wheels are so much 1
smaller than those of the ordinary safe.
ty, the vibration is said to be less per
ceptible. Another advantage claimed
is the small, compact gear, which does
away with the usual gear case and
never needs any attention. Altogether,
the development of this new wheel will
be watched with interest.-Exchaugc.
elman'. Library.
French papers announce the offer for
sale of the library of Renan. The li
brary is divided into two parts, the first *
including the oriental library, to whose
collection Renan paid great attention, e
and containing books on the philology u
and history of the oriental languages.
The second part contains books on gen- ci
eral philology, claselical studies, thbs
middle ages, etc. Renan himself ex
pressed a desire that the library, in
ease it shouli be sold, should be dis- T
posed of . a block, or at least the books a
in the oriental part be kept together.
