Torchlight Parade !
In view of the now certain majori
ty in this State of not less than 5000
and probably 10,000 ; in gratifica
tion for the tremendous gains, and
large Democratic majorities in the
Northern States ; and last, bnt not
least, to express our joy over our vic
tory in this Parish, we suggest that
there be a grand Torchlight Proces
sion next SATURDAY NIGHT. To
this end we call a meeting at the
Town Hall at 2 o'clock Wednesday,
to make the necessary arrangements.
Come one ! Come everybody !
JUSTICE TO OUB ALLIES.
Now that the election is over, and
the White People's Ticket has suc
ceeded beyond the expectations ot
the most sanguine, it behooves us to
be both just and conciliatory. As
victors we can afLrd to be generous.
To those colored voters, who broke
loose from their old political masters,
and over come the prejudices, that
had been aroused by designing dem
agogues, and joined in with us on
Monday last, we owe a debt of grati
tude, and our people should extend
to them all the kindness and assis
tance in their power. They came up
boldly to the relief of Louisiana in
the dark hour of doubt and peril and
gave their votes for her redemption,
and the restoration of an honest and
good government. They have de
monstrated the fact that the leaders
of the Radical party have failed to
«'ecreo and misjudge them, by their
oft repeated stories and that they
wish peace, order and prosperity in
this Parish we have guaranteed to
them every right and immunity un
der the law, that they exercise, and
promised them the protection of the
law, and it now becomes the duty of
the White People to see these prom
ises fulfilled. In every instance we
wish the law enforced without dis
tinction of color or race, to the end,
that crimes may be repressed, and
Overy citizen be permitted to exer
cise his trade, occupation or profes
r ion without interference. It is a
»ell known fact, that in this parish
the colored people complained very
bitterly of the Republican office
holders, because the law gave no pro
tection to them. This fact, influenc
ed a largo number of colored voters,
and they accepted in good faith otir
>romises, and we must not forget
them. Let every planter, merchant
and omployer give the preference in
employing laborers of any kind to
those colored people that supported
our ticket on Monday last. Some
distinction is due, and it should be
made, on every occasion. The pes
tiferous politicians on every planta
tion, could with great propriety, now
the election is over, be made exam
ples of, for future effect. Let them
know that the White People in Ra
pides own our soil, and there is no
law that can compel them to harbor
an enemy for two years, and have
them at every election join in with
their oppressors. While they are
perfectly free to exercise the ballot
us they see fit, we have the same
right to give preference to these
who have exhibited a desire to re
lieve us of our burdens and do away
with the unnatural state of affairs
that has existed for the last six years.
Let our citizens be moderate, be firm
and above all be just
ing- Get your torches ready for
Saturday, and joiu in the Torchlight
Procession.
The Parish Election !
People's Majority 3501!
GLORIOUS VICTORY Î ! !
The official count of the vote of
Rapides Parish published by us in
another place, shows a majority for
the People's Ticket, straight out, of
350. The average majority is 333J
according to the count as kept by
ourselves. There never was and
never can be a more peaceable,
quiet and orderly election than w?s
that on last Monday, iu this Parish.
The intimidation was all on the
other side this time. Blue coats,
glittering bayonets, shiuing car
bines and belts full of cartridges,
were all over the Parish, and at al
most every Preciuct, and yet we
routed them, horse, foot and dra*
goons. The radicals moved heav
en and earth to intimidate us, but
the Anglo-Saxon blood in the veins
of our people, was aroused by the
foul attempt to overawe them, and
the result is a grand and glorious
viotory for right over wrong, for
intelligence over brutal ignorance,
and for honesty over unblushing
corruption. This result might have
been foreseen by the oppressors
who would have ground us to the
dust, and they reckoned without
their host, if they thought that
born freemen could be overridden,
outraged and intimidated by such
a paultry show of brutal power.
The game was too thin ! Rapidi
ans don't scare worth a cent I
Now we are anxious to know
what move Kellogg, Packard & Co.,
backed by Williams and Grant,
will make to cheat us out ot the
victory we have won. Intimida
tion won't do, for it was our side
that was intimidated. Fraud won't
do, for the whole Election machin
ery was in their hands. A Repub
lican Registrar registered the vo
ters, and while we believe he was
in the main perfectly fair, his sym
pathles weVe certainly not with us,
nor did he in any way lean towards
our side. A Republican Police Ju
ry named the voting Preeiucts and
appointed the Commissioners of
Election. The count was made at
the polls, and publicly, by these
Commissioners and the Registrar
made the official compilation given
above.
At no poll in the Farisli was
there any shadow of disturbance,
and at all the negro Precincts arm
ed soldiers were present to prevent
any intimidation, and negro poli
ticians were there to prevent and
counteract any persuasive influence
we might have exercised over the
Republican voters. We went into
the fight with all the odds against
us, and they with every chance in
their favor. We have won, and
now by the Eternal God who rules
over us, we the people of Rapides,
both white aud black, whose votes
have won the victory in favor of
honesty and intelligence, mean to
have the fruits of that victory ! We
will not submit to fraud nor will
wo be deterred from seeing that our
officers have their offices by any
power of Kellogg or Grant himself.
We give tair warning to the po
litical manipulators who will prob
ably tiy to cheat us by chicanery
and fraud, and in the name of the
sovereign people regardless of par
ty, that they can not and shall not
swindle us out of our victory. Upon
their own heads rest the responsi
bility for the attempt, if it is made.
A word to the icm.
Election Incidents.
Monday morning broke upon the
Radicals hopeful, jubilant and con
fident Every preparation had
been made ; every point was guard
ed; politicians were flying here,
there and everywhere, and the
election commenced. The Radicals
had a yellow ticket, we had a white
one. At Alexandria where the U.
S. Infantry were camped all around
the ballot box, and where the cav
alry were riding around town in
battle array at first, and parading
around afterwards, as the white
tickets in the hands of both colored
and whites, began to pour in at
about the same rate where it was
expected everything would go for
the yellow ticket, the eyes of the
leaders began to grow bigger and
bigger.
As the five hundred majority
they ' expected here, diminished
down to four hundred, then to
three hundred, and finally to less
than two hundred, and while all
this was being done peaceably,
quietly and under the very guns of
the hostile force sent here to give
the colored people a chance to vote
the Radical ticket, the leaders and
aspirants for office, began to realize
that a Waterloo defeat was in store
for them, and their hearts sank.
They knew they could not cry " in
timidation," for there was the box
free for every man to come to and
put in whatever ballot he pleased.
They could not cry " fraud," for
there was John DeLacy Jr., and
Tom Clements and others of their
party right there with pockets full
of Radical tickets, to give to any
one who wauted it, and there was
Vic Porter, a Commissioner setting
right in front ot the box aud ready
to hand out a yellow ticket to any
body who called for it, and there
stood U. S. Supervisor George Y.
Kelso, to see that everything was
done fairly, and that each voter
handed in his own ticket.
At Cheneyville there was Mr.
John Clements, candidate for Sher
iff on their ticket and a squad of
soldiers, and Dr. J. W. Iîass as U.
S. Supervisor, to see to everything.
At Pineville there was H.J. Wright,
a3 Commissioner and Alex. Grin
stead and Bill Kelso a.s U. S. Su
pervisors, to look alter tilings gen
erally, with plenty of outside Work
ers. and this very box turned out a
majority of 2S3 forjudge Daigre,
and a majority of 41 for our whole
ticket. At Lecomte they had Jer
ry Curtis lor Commissioner and a
Supervisor, and they were not sat
isfied with 15S majority. AtCotile
they had soldiers and a Supervisor
or two, and yet we got 100 majori
ty. At Bayou Rapides there was
only a small vote, as most of their
voters came to Alexandria, and we
were legitimately entitled to the
majority, as they only left ns those
who were going to vote for us. At
Latanier, Gov. Wells' precinct, we
suppose they had things all fixed
up right.
These were all the precincts
where there was any colored voters,
as they do not and never have
claimed that any of the Pinewoods
precinct belong to them, and it was
known that they would give us
solid votes. Thus we beat them
with all the odds in their favor,
and the victory is fairly ours as
they themselves acknowledge.
Grant Pabisii Election .—The
election in Grant Parish where
there was only one poll, and that
at Coifax, resulted in a victory for
the White People's Ticket, by a
majority of 22 as officially reported
here. Had the people in the Pine
woods been allowed to polls to
which they were entitled, the ma
jority would have been three hun
dred at least. Good-bye, Ward,
Register, Phillips & Co! Your
day and your reign of infamy is
over !
We notice with pleasure tho
smiling face of our friend Jack Iii
Iey behind the bar of Daniel D. Ar
den, at the u Jewel." Jack is a
bully boy, and will be glad to sec

his friends, and to hand out to
them the very best of Liquors and
Cigars. Dan keeps only the very
best of eve rythin g

THE VOTE.
We kept the vote of the precincts in tabular form, as it was called oat
by the Registrar, and we give below the total, which differs a little from
the result as taken from the list as kept by the Clerk of the Registrar.
This is because be was required by law to make seperate lists of scatter
ing votes, and votes with differences in the names. These we kept reg
ularly, giving to each Candidate his full vote. This is not official, but
is the actual vote cast :

From the above it will be seen that the highest number of votes was
2818, taking the vote for Treasurer as a criterian. The average majority
from this list will be found to be 333J.
The Offices.
So far as we have heard them,
the lenders of the Radical party
here, express themselves as willing
| acquiesce iu tliyir defeat and do
not propose to attempt to cheat us
out of our well earned® victory.
This conclusion ou their part is a
wise one, and wo advise them to
adhere to it. Wc think wo know
the temper of our people and as we
understand it, they are unanimous
ly resolved not to submit to any
fraud, and they are determined that
our officers shall have their oftfces
or that nobody shall have them.
It will take a guard of a Compa
ny of U. S. Troops to every officer,
to eat with him, walk the streets
with him in the day time, and to
sleep with him at night, to keep
every one of the defeated Candi
dates in office, should Kellogg and
his Servile Returning Board
tempt to put them in the offices for
which they have now been fairly
and squarely defeated. They had
all the election machinery, had
troops, both infantry and cavalry,
all over the Parish, and they got
beaten fairly and honestly.
If there is now any way in which
the clearly and emphatically ex
pressed will of the people can be
defeated, there is but one thing
for the freemen both white and
black, who elected our ticket to do,
and that is to vineet fraud with
force, and assert both the dignity
of their manhood and the last right
ot freemen. It would be no use for
us to go into another election.
E^Our friend Edouard Wiel,
whoso name the Radicals put on
their ticket for Magistrate as a
bait for the gudgeons, never author
ized the use ot his name by them
for that or any other position. The
printing of their tickets was done
secretly and he did not know that
his name was on them until tho day
of the election.

THE RESULT.
The result of the election will lie
seen in the new life and vigor which
will be infused into business of a 1
kinds; iu the bright faces of all our
Ô
people, white and black, who
achieved for ns the victory ; in the
peace and quiet which will reigtio,
from "one end of the parish to the
other; in the good will and mutual
assistance which will prevail be
tween the two races here and in
the revival of the days when plenty
was our portion and want was un
known. Where all was dread and
depression all is now eertainty and
enthusiasm. We will now have an
opportunity of showing to our col
ored friends that our professions of
good will were sincere and that our
guarantee of protection in all their
lights was honest. It was a long,,
wearisome road we have been trav
elling for these last eight years anil
it seemed as if we would never
reach the end, but we have got
there at last and now we can draw
a long, deep breath of relief. The
best part of the result is that it is
for all time, the colored people have
learned who their friends are anil
the hold of the Radicals over them
is broken forever. In our rejoicing
we oyght not to forget to give our
solemn thanks to the Supreme
Ruler, who changed the hosts of
the people and who has given us tho
victory. Wo utter a solemn, thank
God !
The campaign is over and
Rapides has nobly done her duty.
To-day there is general rejoieing all
over the parish among the colored
people as well as the whites at our
glorious success. Tho downfall of
Radicalism in this parish is a terri
ble blow to the leaders of that par
ty here but they had better give it
up with as good grace as possible.
No power ou earth can help them
now for the next two years to come.
Hurrah, lor Rapides! All honor
to the colored people who threw otî
their shackles aud voted with tu»!
