While laborig- ander ft o des

tra =e.pdea is indeed s mource of
great - imiJed t of hisis family, who
hehearainrt welth a 8 calibethyr Smithe &
whole act was committed in the reanty
Whlle laboriom, on the second oo ofa
pondency, Paul D. St. Julien, aged B
oe byear, a promising young medicaal
street, where he all of hbeeis earthdinly
troubles "b'4lwoting himself through- c,
thsine brainthe monwith a 8 caliber Smith 8,
Wesson revolver.
The act was committed in the rear
galiery room, on the second Boor of 5M
the boarding-house No. 038 Canal E
street, where he has-been boarding e,
since the month of October. 1892, n
singe which time he has been attend
ing. the Tulane' medical lectures.
The young man was born and M
raised at Broussardville, Lafayette
parish, and is the son of a well
known planter Of that place. He
was a bright and intelligent gentle
man, and expected to graduate and 1
become a doctor next April. When
the suicide first came. to this city
and began his studies he secured as 0
his room-mate Mr. Gerasime Rich
ard, of Sunset, St. Landry parish,, fi
who is also attending the medical ti
lectures at the same college.- As d
both of them had known each other
since childhood, and were now on
the verge of manhood and in the c
same class, they became inseparable a
friends. A short time ago St. Julien
received a letter from his relatives
stating that his father intended com- a
ing here, and this seemed to please w
him very much, but a few days ago c
he suddenly became dispondent, p
and his roommate quickly noticed the
fact. He, however, slid nothing to
St. Julien about the matter, as he ti
thought the sudden change might f
have been caused by his studies, t
but it was easily seen that he was
laboring under some mental strain
far more severe than his studies.
His roommate cheered him up the a
best he could, but the young man b
could not be comforted in his trou
bles, and for three consecutive days a
he remained in the house. He would
go to his meals, but would return
without eating anything, and keep s
secluded in his room, apparently
not wishing any consolation. (
n*4#ast .Supday Richard's cousins, h
James Richard, of Jennings, came
to the city to participate in the car
nival festivites and went to the room
with his cousin Gerasime. Yester- C
day evering about 5 o'clock James
Richard noticed that St. Julien *as t
acting in a very strange manner, but
paid no particular attention to him.
As Richard started to leave the room I
St. Julien called him and asked him
if he would come back and Richard i
replied that he would and walked.
over to the dressing case where St.
Julien was sitting on a chair. The
latter then informed him that he was t
in trouble, but what it was he did i
not' say. Richard advised him to go z
out and walk around and he would
feel better, but this he declined to
do.
His roommate next came into the 1
room and asked him if he was going
to see the parade and he answered
in the negative. As he complained
of being cold, Richard had a fire
made for him.
At 6 o'clock when the supper bell
rang St. Julien declined to go down
stairs and his companion left the
room with his cousin. After partak
ing of supper they went out to see
the parade. After witnessing the pro
cession and walking around the city
they returned to the boarding house ,
shortly before midnight and pro
ceeded up stairs to their room.
The door was pat tly open, while
the lamp on the dressing case was
burning dimly. As they attempted
to push the door wide open they
found that it met with an obstruction.
tThey instantly looked in and were
Shorrified to see young St. Ju!ien
, lying on the floor at the foot of the
bed with a pistol clutched in his
right hand, and his chest and his
face and breast bespattered with
I blood, while on the floor was a
r large pool of the crimson fluid.
p The inmates were hastily informed
of what had taken place add when
James Richard went to St. Julien's
Strunk where he had left his revolver,
he .discovei9 d that the suibide had
c taken his weapon and placing the
Smuzzle into his mouth sent a bullet

Mr. Alfred Hebert is in hard q
luck. Some time-ago he purchased ih
a fine sow in Kanls- at a cost of $4o.
He had the sow brought to his farm I b
near town aind put in a pen, but t
subsequent events proved that the d
c6ly'swize was not destined to re
m ain there long. A few days ago fr
thieves entered the pen, killed; the h
sow and carried her away. Mr. i1
Hebert searched the houses of sev- hf
eral parties, and had one negro ar
rested, charged with the :theft.

FEBRUARY "COSMOPOLITAN"
The secret of the great success of
The Cosmopolitan is not so hard to
d find, if one looks carefully. over the
number for February. A story by
Valdes, the famous Spanish novelist,
the first from his pen to appear in
Sany American magazine, is begun in
t this number. Arthur Sherburne
, Hardy's story, "A Rejected Manu
e script," is charmingly illustrated by I,
L. Marold, who we believe makes
his first appearance in the magazines
. on this side of the water. A profusely
0 illustrated article on the designing
f and building of a war-ship appeals
n to the interest taken by all in the
new navy, and a thrilling description
of a naval combat under the signifi
' cant title: "*The Meloban and the
e Pentheroy" describes, after the
manner of the Battle of Dorking, a
a possible sea-fight, the outcome of
which is watched by the entire naval
world. "Gliding Flight" is an in
a telesting contribution to the problem
Sof aerial navigation by one who has
. stutdied the flight of soaring birds
Sin the East for twenty years. Elaine
Goodale, who married a member
d of the Sioux nation, has some inter
it esting information of Indian Wars
at and Warriors. T. C. Crawford, the
_ Washington correspondent, gives
ti the first half of a startling story,
under the title of "''The Disappear
* ance Syntdicate." The poetry in
e this numlber by Sir. Edwin Arnold,:
Graham R. Tomson and William
_ Young, is unusually goodo The De
partmeinits, 'In the World of Art and
g Letters" and the "Progress of
ot Science" continue to have as contri
