THE MINNESOTA FIERY CROSS
VOLUME 1, NUMBER 43
TWILIGHT’S
THINKLINGS
MODERN FICTION A CURSE
THE FOREIG N-LA NGUAGE
PRESS
RECENTLY I rambled into a
bookstore. Books with gau
dy “coverings” and sensational
titles were scattered all over the
place. I couldn’t imagine sensi
ble people buying such book as I
saw in “outrageous” numbers of
fered for sale at prices that
ranged from one to three dollars
a copy.
Modern fiction is for the most
part unworthy of recognition.
In fact, there are very few novels
now being published that will
live beyond a period of three
months —and that length of life
is far too long. How many books
written thus far during the twen
tieth century will be read 50
years from now? Can you name
a book that came off the press
for the first time within the last
twenty years that stands out as
a literary masterpiece?
Something is wrong some
where when very little in the
form of fiction which now comes
from the book presses is entitled
to a place in either the public li
brary or the American home.
Mr. Simon L. Nye, president of
the American Booksellers’ Asso
ciation said a short time ago, “A
book of fiction that has been pub
lished three months virtually is
dead, forgotten, and awaiting
removal to the bargain tables al
most without exception. From
the bookseller’s standpoint it
seems that the publisher striv
ing in keen competition, aims to
see how many, not how worthy,
books he can publish in a given
period.” Who will say that Mr.
Nye’s statement is inaccurate?
Ultra-commercialism today curs
es the field of imaginative liter
ature. I hear people occasionally
denounce the brain-children of
Lertha ln. Clay, Charles Garvicc,
Mrs. E. D. E. N. Southworth and
others who wrote “love stories’’
for a generation now gray with
age, but I’d rather see my chil
dren reading the “old-timers”
than the suggestive, salacious
novels now found in the parlors
of American homes.
Did you ever look over the
magazines that are on sale at a
newsstand? A study of the peri
odical literature coming from
American presses reveals a dis-
f listing amount of worthless
armful articles and stories. De
pravity at its lowest ebb is fea
tured and tinctured with vile
sensationalism. Confessions (?)
of “ wives,” unmarried mothers,
concubines, free-lovers, vampires,
human wrecks —are spread over
the nation and read by girls and
boys in their “teens.lmmoral
ity is condoned and explained.
Daring pictures appear as illus
trations so frequently as to blunt
finer sensibilities and dis
torted conceptions of life. Feed
ing upon rotten fiction results in
mental storms and fearful laxity
of conduct. Tell me what a per
son reads, and I’ll tell you what
he or she really is. “Give a dog
raw meat and he becomes fero
cious,” some one has said.
Whether or not that statement
is true, I do not know. However,
let a girl, experiencing the mys
teries of sex, read continuously
that which is lewd, suggestive,
and shortly she yields to the Sa
tanic promptings of the irrelig
ious libertine. A young man who
crams his mind with glorified
sin is ere long overcome by the
cravings of lust and goes in
search of a victim.
America must put literary
tastes on a higher plane. The
power of the printed page is so
great that it is folly to ignore the
influence of books and magazines.
You cannot legislate more wor
thy literary tastes. The home,
the school and the church work
ing together can solve the prob
lems coming directly from com
mercialized vulgarity and glori
fied sin. After all, it is a matter
of good home training, proper in
struction in our public schools
and an effective presentation of
Christian principles.

Campaign Was Bitter One
With Many Futile Ef

VOTE HEAVIEST IN CITY
Protestantism Will Not Always
Be Helpless Majority Under
Gang Politics
ST. PAUL, MINN., May 17.- Mayor
Arthur E. Nelson was re-elected tor
another term after one of the most
spirited campaigns that has ever
oeen witnessed in this city. Person
alities were conspicuous by the bit
terness with which they were uttereu.
The mayorality candidates dodged
issues to a startling degree, which
thoroughly disgusted St. Paulites
who are tired of political methods
that give nothing definite for the
voter’s consideration. The interest
in the campaign however, was very
keen as indicated by the tabulations
of the final results of the voting.
Tuesday. There were more votes
cast May 6 for municipal candidates
than in any previous city election.
Frequently efforts were made to
inject the Ku Klux Klan into the
campaign, but evidently all badly
missed fire. Mayor Nelson was from
time to time accused of being a mem
ber of the Protestant order, but
denied any Klan connection with
monotonous frequency. But one of
these days there will be a mayority
candidate who will dare to speak
openly for the Klan and its wonder
ful program of Americanism. This
does not mean that the Ku Klux
Klan will endorse any candidate, for
the organization is not a political
party. The Klan is not in politics,
but Klansmen are, as all good Amer
icans should be. Two years from now
will see organized Protestantism a
mighty factor in the political affairs
of the Saintly City.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
Minnesota Doctor Who Studied in
Europe Addresses Ameri
can Legion Post
WARREN. MINN., May 15—That
the German nation is not “all in ’ but
is in better financial condition than
it ever was. is the assertion of Dr.
O. N. Meland of the Warren hospital,
who recently returned from a post
graduate trip which took him to lead
ing hospitals in Europe and who
spoke at a meeting of the Warren
post of the American Legion Tuesday
night.
“The Germans deflated their cur
rency with a purpose,’’ he said. “The
government paid off its war debts to
its citizens and railroads paid off
their indebtedness with the deflated
money and are now in good financial
condition.”
German industrialists like the late
Stinnes, borrowed large sums of mon
ey and invested them in England,
paying back after a few months when
the mark had dropped still further,
thus making handsome profits. Dr.
Meland said.
Dr. Meland said he visited England
when that country was in the midst
of a political upheaval brought on
by the serious unemployment which
prevailed there, especially among the
former service men. Austria has a
bitter hatred for Germany because
it feels that the Germans are respon
sible for the war, but has a kindly
feeling towards England and Amer
ica, he said.
Anton Ynrrve, of Middle River, com
mander of the Legion for the ninth
district, Ole R. Sande, of Thief River
Falls, district adjutant and Oscar
Smith, commander of the Thief River
post, were guests of the local post at
the meeting. „

PUT AMERICANS ON GUARD”-GEORGE WASHINGTON
North Dakota Shows
Interest in Minnesota
Warehouse Leaders
FARGO, N. D., May 16. North Da
kotans are ufore interested in the
men elected to the Minnesota rail
road and warehouse commission that
they are in their own warehouse com
mission, Usher L. Burdick, Fargo
attorney, told a meeting at the Fargo
armory last night. A. F. Teigen.
Moorhead, candidate for the Minne
sota commission, also spoke.
The laws under which the Minne
sota commission works are good ones,
but the commissioners do not always
enforce them, Mr. Burdick said.
Granting the Minneapolis Chamber
of Commerce the power to place the
Minnesota seal on cars of grain, and
permitting South St. Paul market
authorities to charge S4B per ton, or
war time prices for hay, were two
matters which the speaker mentioned
as points in question.
He explained the North Dakota in
terest in the Minnesota commission
by saying that 90 per cent of the
grain and livestock raised in the state
are marketed in Minnesota, while on
ly 10 per cent are marketed at home.
WOBBLIE FAILED TO
BREAK UP KLAN MEET
PrincipleM Explained in Detail at
Public Gathering at
Windom
WIJfDOM, MINN., May 15.-The free
lecture of the Ku Klux Klan helu
last Wednesday was very well attend
ed. A younv man from Martin coun
ty gave the talk. A fiery cross was
lighted and burned during the lec
ture. Upon opening the meeting the
speaker asked if there was a Protest
ant Minister in the audience, and,
none answering, the speaker opened
the meeting with a short prayer 'Jma
the same at closing.
The speaker explained, at consid
erable length, the principles and ten
ets of the organization, taking them
up in the order as printed on a card
which read as follows: the tenets of
the Christian religion; white suprem
acy; protection of our pure woman
hood; just laws and liberty; closer
relationship of pure Americanism;
the upholding of the constitution of
these United States; the separation
of church and state; freedom of
speech and of the press; closer rela
tionship between capital and Ameri
can labor; preventing unwarranted
Strikes by foreign labor agitators;
prevention of fires and destruction of
Property by lawless elements; the
limitation of foreign immigration,
and law and order.
At the close of the talk the speak
er asked for questions, and made very
reasonable arid satisfactory answers
to the questions asked. However,
there was one disturber, who perhaps
illustrated very timely the need of
such a secret order, a drunken man
who persisted in talking and wanting
to have it understood that he be
longed to the I. W. W.
The speaker denied the charge that
the Klan is anti-Catliolic, or that it
was against any class or political
party. And as far as we have been
able to learn, everyone who heard the
talk thought it most reasonable and
found nothing to which one could
take exception.
W. A. Sunday Arrives
in Minnesota to
Regain Health
ROCHESTER, MINN., May 15.—W
A. “Billy” Sunday, evangelist extra
ordinary, arrived here at 7:15 a. m
today to enter the Mayo clinic for
treatment for a kidney ailment. He
spent a restful night aboard the pri
vate car which brought him from
.‘.jemphis, “the best in the last 12
nights.” according to a statement of
his attending physician. Dr. R. L.
Sanders. Mr. Sunday walked unas
sisted from the train to the hotel,
where reservations had been made for
himself and his party.
The Sunday car, which was at
tached to the Rochester Limited of
the Chicago & Northwestern Rail
road, was boarded at Winona by Dr.
H. B. Plummer of the Mayo clinic.
Waiting at the station here were Dr.
W. J. Mayo, a personal friend of the
Sunday family, Dr. Henry Meyerding,
and Dr. W. F. Braasch of the clinic
staff.
Dr. Sanders, who had lieen in con
ference wtih Dr. Plummer on the
way from Winona, issued a statement
upon his patient’s condition, imme
diately upon the arrival of the train.
“Rev. Sunday is very much im
proved,” the statement said. Last
night was the best he has had in 12
nights. His temperature is normal
this morning.”
“Ma” Sunday, still suffering from
injuries sustained in an automobile
accident, was carried from the car
on a stretcher to a waiting ambu
lance As she was being lifted down
the steps she called cheerfully to the
group on the platform, “Hello, every
body. Isn't this u flowery bed of
ease?”
At the hotel, Mr. Sunday and his
wife were luken immediately to the
suite which had been set aside for
them.

KLAN IS GROWING IN
NORTHERN MINNESOTA
Fiery Urossen Burned at Backus
and Pine River —Organiza-
tion Work Good
ST. PAUL, II:INN.--The Ku Klux
Klan is daily getting stronger and
more active in the northern coun
ties of Minnesota, reports reaching
the state office indicate. The Klan
has so fa»- surpassed the expectations
of the most enthusifuUb; supporters
of the Protestuht oroor’Sh ‘rat part
of the state.
Recently there appeared in Backus
a fiery cross. The Backus Tribune
in its issue of May 8 states: “A cross
supposed to be the kind burned by
the Ku Klux Klan appeared in a field
east of the schoolhouse Friday night,
lay 2, at the time the audience was
leaving the movies. A local detective
is supposed to have seen the humor
ist who lighted the sacred symbol.”
From a news item that was printed
in The Tine River Sentinel-Blaze we
learn that Pine River has not been
■verlooked by the Klan. The Senti
nel-Blaze reports that three fiery
'losses made their appearance Thurs
ay evening, Mav 8, one near the
depot and the other near the Day
residence.

Sandstone with obvious gladness wel-

accompanied him. A group of the

after a complete explanation of the
principles of the Protestant order
were given an opportunity to join
hands with the millions of Americans
now guarding the the fundamentals
of our civilization. To merely state
that the opportunity to become a
member of trs Ku Klux Klan was en
thusiastically accepted is putting it
mildly indeed.

—Judge E. J. Clark, of Texas,
being again placed on the stand
in the Mayfield case Tuesday af
ternoon declared he did not
spend a dime in the Mayfield
campaign and did not contribute
a cent to aid him in any way.
He also admitted that the Klan
did not instruct him to give five
cents of the Klan’s money to help
Mayfield and that he did not do
so.
Judge Clark also admitted getting
and keeping a part of the money ac
cording to a resolution of the Klan
and said that he spent a part of it for
office expenses and kept a portion of
it for his salary. Not a cent of the
Klan money went to help Mayfield
through his hands. He and Bob Hen
ry. defeated candidate for the sen
ate, were not law partners at that
time, but are now.
The question of violence was gone
into thoroughly by the Peddy attor
neys. who contended that the Klan is
an illegal and criminal organization
The member** of the subcommittee
took issue with the attorney on this
contention, judging from their nu
merous questions of both attorney
and witness.
Judge Clark stated that Dr. Evarn

Fiery Crosses Burned
at Hibbing, Minnesota
HIBBING. MINN. May 18.—A fiery
cross the second seen on the range
in the past five days, the third seen
in Hibbing within a period of two
months, burned from the top of the
Brooklyn dump on the south end of
Granite street, last night.
Autoists coming from Duluth on
the Dupont road, noticed it. It lit
up the countryside for a distance of
a mile. It was the largest cross of
the three burned, and red lights
were used.
What was credited to the Klan be
fore, proved the work of boys who
admitted to a newspaperman that
they were burning the crosses to ar
ouse excitement.
The fact that last night was a
stormy night, one of the worst of the
year, does not make the burning of
the cross appear the work of boys.
It looks more like the doings of
grownups, police claim.

Somehow the Books
Won’t Help Mr. Peddy
Somehow or other the books of
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
as brought to Washington and ex
hibited to the lawyers and subcom
mittee by J. E. Mactjuinn, assistant
cashier, and Dr. H. C. Montgom
ery, member of the national
finance committee, do nt>t seem to
show any money or monies having
been paid to Senator Mayfield, of
Texas, during his campaign made
in 1922.
The Peddy attorneys seem de
termined to show that the Klan
had a hand in the Mayfield elec
tion, whether the Klan had or not,
and they are leaving no stone un
turned to dig up something on the
Klan. It’s mighty hard digging,
and up to date nothing has been
found in the Klan books that will
Help Mr. Peddy and his attorneys.
Thus another theory is about to
explode, and it would seem that
Messrs. Mac Quinn and Montgom
ery are having a fine trip to'Wash
ington from Atlanta at the ex
pense of Uncle Sam. The Imperi
al Palace is sure lonely without
these two fine gentlemen nowa
days, but it won’t be long until
they return with the books, and
Mr. Peddy’s attorneys will be
obliged to cook up another excuse
or else take the licking that is
coming to them.

About Order
McINTOSH. MINN.. May 17.—Lo
cally the Ku Klux Klan is rapidly
coming into a position where it can
do some real work fo| the better
ment of the community. Of
there has appeared a very satisfact
ory interest in the Protestant move
ment which heretofore has been con

There are a number of well-mean

how some men of Mclntosh who were

Klan Is Tame, Learn
Webster City Gentry
.No Prancing Steeds, Shots or fries
At Outdoor Meeting There
WEBSTER CITY, JA.. May 16. The
citizens of this community are to
day somewhat disappointed. They
have been reading a great deal about
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
and their alleged outrageous activi
ties, as reported in the press. Con
sequently, when a meeting was held
on the Kincaid farm two miles west
of the city last night, some unex
pected things were anticipated.
But the unusual didn’t take place.
As The Webster City Daily News puts
it: ‘There were no trampling stal
lions, no blaring bugles a la ‘Birth of
a Nation,’ no shots or cries. Nothing
but clatter of Detroit Rolls-Royces
and the hum of neighborly conver
sation”
At any rate, Webster City people
know that the Klan is not the wild
eyed organization it has been painted.
Thursday evening’s meeting was an
invitational affair. Robed men guard
ed the field on the Kincaid farm and
admitted only members and their
friends who were properly qualified.
A state lecturer did the talking from
an improvised platform in the mid
dle of the field. The local Klan car
ried its own power plant on a truck
to the meeting grounds and electric
lights were strung up over the crowd.
Shortly after 9 o'clock a 20-foot
fiery cross was lighted, and later in
the evening before the meeting broke
up another was set ablaze.
There was no ceremony. The "ali
ens” who lined the fences around the
field looking for something exciting
were disappointed. Hut those who
were inside the guard lines had u
good time. The Webster City dally
sa>s so in the following worus:
‘The meeting wns decidedly infor
mal, and there was no ceremonial
presentation The Kluxer* walked
about chatting and smoking cigar

—ln the riot started Saturday
morning by students of Notre

lasted until early Bunday morn

were beaten, and American Hags
were stoned and trampled under

who showed no respect for ago

During the riot a three-year
old girl and a white haired man
and woman were struck by riot
ers. Plate-glass wimhfws were
shattered. One hotel, having a
party of Protestants, was forced
to close and lock its floors against
the mob.
Rioting continued for funeral hours
before any attempt v/a n made by po

By three o’clock .Srwiay

appearances the attack had been care
fully planned, as students had hraggtd
that the Klan could not nut on any
thing in South Bend. The mob be
gan gathering about eight o’clock in
front of the local Klan offices. Act
ual violence began at 11:30 with the
stoning of flags in window*. The at
tempt of the students to rush the
Klan building was balked. The at
tempt of hlansmen to avoid blood
shed probably saved many lives.
All autos with flags were stopped
by students, and occupants beaten
and flags torn and trampled on the
ground.' At six o’clock a party of
Klansinen and women arriving from
Gary was set upon by an enfuriat d
mob and men and women beaten
alike. Members of the Hammond,
Indiana, band, were brutally beaten
and their instruments demolished.
Chief of Police Lurry Lane, Catho

cause about sixty per cent of his de

heading a committee of three ap
