THE WATSON MELON.
Seed grown for several years
and introduced by me is of
fered to the public in limited
quantities, as follows:
% lb., 35c; % lb., 65c; 1 lb.
$1.25.
Seed guaranteed pure and
from first hands. Address
W. A. WATSON, Thomson,
Georgia.
In offering this melon more exten
sively to the public I desire to give
its history. About eight years one of
my brother’s (Thomas E. Watson)
friends sent him a small package of
the seed and stated to him that he
called it the Watson melon. My
brother gave the seed to me, I planted
a few hills the first year and was so
greatly pleased with the melon that
I planted about two acres in them
the following year, the yield and sales
were so satisfactory that I discarded
all others.
I have been raising melons for mar
ket the past thirty years, and I con
sider the Watson melon the very best
that I ever saw in every respect. It
grows larger, under the same circum
stances, has fewer rotten ends, keeps
longer after getting ripe, is very solid,
•for which reason it is a good shipper.
It is, in my opinion, the best melon
ever put on the market, with a deli
cious flavor that has no superior.

THE COMMONER
TOM WATSON’S WEEKLY
and
WM. J. BRYAN’S PAPER
Both One Ye&r for Only $1.50
Mr. Bryan is the most conspicuous
figure in American politics today. He
is more —he is a World Figure. His
views on men and things are awaited
with interest in foreign countries as
well as at home. THE COMMONER
is his medium of communication with
the world; but it is more than a per
sonal organ, for it covers the whole
realm of political thought. Hence, no
one, whether a follower or an oppo
nent of Bryan’s doctrines, can fail to
be interested in the columns of this
famous paper. .

Editors Weekly Jeffersonian:
The Lord is our helper. The neg
roes are getting too lazy and mean to
work in the fields. Overplanting and
overproduction of cotton is being
made providentially impossible. Thus
does divine wisdom overrule the folly
of foolish farmers. R. C. COSTIN.

Editors Weekly Jeffersonian:
Is it known that some of our news

are owned by the railroads? We think
there are some so owned or controlled

ENDORSE WATSON’S SPEECH.

$2,000,000 of Water.
The Georgia Railway and Electric
Company of Atlanta adds $2,000,000
to its stock, divided among its present
stockholders. The issue is pure spring
water. It calls for $120,000 more divi
dends annually to be assessed on At
lanta street car travel and electric
light users. It is a re-enforcement
against the movement for municipal
ownership of the company’s property
and franchises. Here is where the At
lanta city council could get very busy
in the people’s interest, if it had not
been largely elected by the company’s
officers, employes and campaign funds.
Atlanta seems to be the worst corpor
ation throttled city in the south, if not
in tlie whole nation.

in full the speech made by T. E. Wat
son on January 22, 1907.
Resolved, First, That we appreciate
and hail with delight his willingness
to cooperate with us and help us in
our endeavor to throw off the shack
les which bind the farmer class.
Second. That we believe it to be the
duty of every farmer and laborer of
Georgia and the southern states to
subscribe for and read his paper, viz.,
Weekly Jeffersonian and his maga
zine. Both are in interest of the or
ganized farmer.
Third. That we invite Mr. Watson
at some convenient time this year to
address the Farmers’ Union of this
county.
Fourth. That we send a copy of these
resolutions to the Union News and
Watson’s Jeffersonian for publication.

THEY CAN DO IT.
Editors Weekly Jeffersonian:
I am much concerned to see two
cent fares granted by the general as
sembly of Georgia. The railroads say
such a rate would be ruinous to them,
but as one who has had railroad ex
perience I figure that the increased
travel at two cents per mile "would
more than overcome the loss per mile
and the increased cost of operating
the trains, which is slight as between
empty and loaded passenger trains.

orous fashion. B. F. P.
