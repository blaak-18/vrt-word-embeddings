Ye men of the North, 'of the East and

Awake from your torpor (of criminal rest.
Columnia's daughter groans in her pa iun
Columbiha's self is being loaded in chamins.
H A Cronuwvell has risen here in your land,
And on her jair throat has placed rude

Her life to crush "out, her last sob to

A Natr ! has coime to slay his proud moth

like a mouth.

The hall whelre assembled the wisdom.

Sent by a people, who THoyO(RTw they

Until You are sharing my, sad dreary

Then yy»n'll struggle and groan, but strug

I cannot help you. I'm bleeding and torn;
Of my righuts, of my wealth, of my chil

And the fate that I suffer you may suffer
soon;
For the blood of the nation wi!v flow

Then, strike in God's name ! Start forth

LOUISIANA.
Sure never land was' so accursed,
Not Egypt 'ma;tl: the rod
When locusts, lice a.nd frogs, so foul
Were sent by Israel's God !
Our frredom's gone, our land's enchained ;
Vice rules the present hour,
And Ignorane,, Hate diklva i6 ,
flMust have uubouuded power. .
Shall we submit to these last wrongs,
And nlurlner not a wordfl
And dare we not with life oppose
The vile and venal horde i
Shall we be slaves where we have ruled,
And leave our children slaves ?
'Tis better far that those we love
Should rest within their graves!
We would have peace; we want no strife;
But patience hath an end;.
And he whose soul hath once been free
May break, but ne'er should bend.
'Tis wiser far to strive and fail,
And fall with armor on,
Than live a life of wretchedness
With hope and honor gone
Our foes are many, friends arIe few,
Each word we say is caught
Andl, with malicious ennuinllg 'this
With diftlrent~ineaning fraught.
liBpt now we say, and swear it too!
That more we can not bear,
And those who now insnlt anrid rob,
Should stop, or should Beware!
VWhen var'swred waves rolled o'er ourland
We bore ourselves like men, f
And when we faid oulr flag we f'urled
To raise it ne'er l:gulin;
But by those hopes whieh once we had,
And by our na:lhoodl's might,
We sWearno more sutih Wrongs to bLrook -
We want,, we'll have the right!
',eInisinuna conquered" Jins been writ, a
But who is lie who'll dare
To 'tny that e'er withl victory croned
1Shall brightly leanl her star ?
Her sons "ure, manuy, brave aind true,
As gory fields cnn tell,
And though her foes do triumph now
There's vgeauauce - and a hell!

Woxns OF GoLD.-Married people
should treat each other like lovers
all their lives-then they would he
happy. Bickeling and .qnarling will
soo8n reak off love affairis; conse
quently lovers inidulge in uch only
to a limited extent. But some people
-men aRid women both-when they=
have once got married, think they
may do as they please, and it will
make no difflrence. They make a
great mistake. It eanses till the dif
tirence in tile world. Women shulid
grow more devoted and, men more
ifoud after marrilmge, if they have the
slightest idea of hbeilg hap1py na wives
and husbands. It is loising sight of
this flndamental truth whlic leads
to hliadreds of divorces. Yet many
a man will scold his wife who would
never think of' breathing a hash
word to a sweetheart; and many .
wife. will Ie gluin and morose on her
husband's return who had onily smuiles
and words of cheer for him whenl he
was her suitor. How e a such peo
pie expect to he happy ?
