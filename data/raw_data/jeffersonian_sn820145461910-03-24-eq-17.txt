PRIMITIVE BAPTIST
Martin, Tenn.
“I had a curiosity to see
whether the Primitive Baptist
was as unfair, hide-bound, ar
rogant and abusive as the pa
pers run by missionary fa
natics. . . . To my agreeable
surprise I found that the
whole build and spirit of the
paper was up to my ideal of a
Christian paper. ... In choos
ing your religious reading,
you might give the Primitive
Baptist a trial, even though
you are not of that faith and
order. You’ll get some really
religious literature, if you
do.”—Thos. E. Watson in The
Jeffersonian of February 17

I
Say of Other Editors
They All Do It.
A preacher said: “You editors
dare not tell the truth. Your news
papers would be a failure.” The edi
tor replied: “You are right; and the
minister who will at all times tell the
truth about his members, alive or
dead, will not occupy the pulpit more
than one Sunday, and he will find it
necessary to leave town in a hurry.
The press and the pulpit go hand in
hand with whitewash and kind words,
magnifying light virtues into large
ones. The pulpit, press and grave
stones are the great saint making
triumvirate.” And the great minis
ter went away looking very thought
ful, while the editor turned to his
work, telling about the surpassing
beauty of the bride, while in fact she
was as ugly as a mud fence.—The
Rolla (Missouri) Sharp Shorter.
Nagging Governor Brown.
“Perhaps it would not be wise for
Governor Brown to admit that any
thing Governor Smith did was wise.”
—Macon News.
Governor Brown is wise enough at
all times to admit that ex-Governor
Hoke Smith has a giant intellect and
is a man of power, capable of won
derful achievements, but he is also
too wise to pay attention to barking
and snapping of every little curb
stone poodle in Georgia. It is a pity
that these little, puny whip-snappers
can not see that they are injuring
Hoke Smith’s cause, and overwhelm
ing that distinguished gentleman
with shame because of their fawning
stupidity.—The Coffee County News,
Douglas, Ga.
Senator Borah has introduced an
amendment to the Constitution that
reminds us of the late amendment in
Alabama. It reads: “The right of
citizens of the United States to vote
shall not be denied or abridged by
the United States or by any State on
account of sex.” This sounds very
innocent, and yet it opens up the
polls to every wench in the country.
And, if it was passed, of course the
wenches would go to the polls and
vote, while the ladies and many of
the decent men would be ashamed
of themselves and stay away. This
country doesn’t need such enact
ments. —The Talladega (Ala.) Re
porter.
Congress is too busy with investi
gations to accomplish much in the
way of practical legislation. The
Roosevelt policies are finding hard
sledding with the Aldrich-Cannon
crowd, though, of course, the effort
will be made to fix the blame upon
the insurgent Senators and Repre
sentatives, the only men honestly in
favor of their enactment into law. —
Pell City (Alabama) Progress.
The Senate committee to investi
gate the high cost of living is com
posed of the following Senators:
Gallinger, Smoot, McCumber, Lodge,
Simmons and Crawford. As five of
the gentlemen voted for “the best
tariff bill ever enacted” do you real
ly think they will look to the tariff
as a cause? —The Watertown (S. Da
kota) Times.
While the cost of living is out of
sight—absolutely prohibitory to the
great majority of toilers —the cost
of dying is also mounting into the
realms of the impossible. With the
Food Trust on the one hand and the
Coffin Trust on the other 2 what is
poor suffering humanity to do? Is
there any possible way of stepping
off the earth to Mars or some other
more friendly planet?—The Kansas
Commoner, Wichita, Kansas.
A new member of the House of
Representatives has been looking up
some matters, and finds that that
body has 400 members and 423 em
ployees; that 279 draw salaries of
SI,OOO or more and twenty-six get
$3,000 or more. Some doors, he
©be 3eftersoiuan
says, have two doorkeepers. He has
never seen as many as ten per cent,
of the total number; nobody can tell
what they do, and he is sure their
work is not what the records ostensi
bly indicate. He finds that ninety of
these employees bear the same names
as members, and he is “curious” to
know how many of these 423 are
related to those who employ them
at the public expense. Strange to
say, this member is not from Mis
souri, but from Texas.—The La
Grange (Georgia) Graphic.
The Gainesville (Georgia) Herald
sys: “Little Mary Harris, daughter
of Bud Harris, is said to have per
ished to death here in the very heart
of our city. We refrain from com
ment, for we know not where the
fault lies. However, is is a shock
ingly sad incident.” Mr. Watson can
tell them where the fault lies. But
what’s the use? This is the home
town of our late dearly beloved “Dr.
King, P. E.,” who made it so warm
for us because we tried to direct a
little attention to the condition of
home affairs. Had little “Mary Har
ris” been a “dago,” “Hottentot,”
etc., in some foreign clime every pul
pit would have taken up the wail,
and such lamentation as we would
have heard from ocean to ocean! It’s
doubtful if this case aroused passing
notice, even in Gainesville. How
many preachers do you know who
makes a practice of visiting the
widow, the orphan, the distressed in
body or mind and comforting them
with song, prayers and reading the
Word of God? Too busy chasing the
heathen.—The Gwinett Journal,
Lawrencevill, Ga.
THE SOUTHERN OPTIMIST.
A new paper, the SOUTHERN
OPTIMIST, will be issued in Atlanta,
about April first. It will be eight
pages, semi-monthly, owned and pub
lished by the deaf, for the deaf. It
will depend upon no state nor school
for its support, but upon the edu
cated deaf themselves, of which there
are over fifty-five thousand in the
United States, who have received in
structions at some school for the
deaf. In a letter calling our atten
tion to this new publication, Mrs. C.
L. Jackson, the Editor of the SOUTH
ERN OPTIMIST, writes: “Our pa
per, with the exception of about half
a page, will be secular, devoted to
news and contributions of all that is
of the best interest to the class of
people whose cause we champion.
The half-page we have given to our
evangelist preacher, who will fill it
with short sermons and writings of
his own, home mission work peculiar
to the deaf. It will in no sense have
any connection with anything per
taining to foreign missions, for we do
not, never have, and never will, fa
vor that, for we feel too strongly the
need of a little home mission work
right here among the deaf, who have
been striving for several years to bet
ter their conditions and obtain the
means of establishing some kind of
a church or reading room of their
own, where they could have their
services in the sign language, and
hold all gatherings that would pro
mote their welfare as a whole. So
far we have failed for lack of inter
est of our hearing brethren. One
tenth of the vast sums of money
spent in foreign fields would do un
told good for the deaf right here in
our own country, who, aside from be
ing deprived of hearing and speech,
are as much human as any one. We
are striving as never before for the
recognition of our needs and wants,
but the utter apathy and lack of
sympathy of the majority of the
hearing people is very discouraging
at times. Perhaps they do not un
derstand us.”

PAGE SEVENTEEN
A SOUTHERN INSTITUTION WITH
A REPUTATION.
The world admires genius and en
terprise wherever it is found, and
this is why The Jeffersonian is pre
senting to the public the series of
articles that it has been publishing
about Mr. Eugene Anderson, the
president of the Georgia-Alabama
Business College, at Macon, Ga.
Mr. Anderson certainly deserves the
high place into which he has been
placed by his advanced educational
ideas. A party of New Yorkers who
are devoting themselves to educa
tional work, visited his college at
Macon a short time ago, and they
declared that Mr. Anderson’s meth
ods of teaching were the most won
derful they have ever seen, and that
his connection with the teaching pro
fession is likely to work a revolution
in the teaching ideas and methods
of the present generation.
In addition to this, Mr. Anderson
has shown remarkable progressive
ness in his employment for life plans,
of which his patrons get the benefit;
and his students do office work for
the public, making money out of it,
and thus in many instances paying
their way through college.
It is not to be wondered that a
man who can bring about such re
sults as these in business college
work should be heralded throughout
the nation as a distinguished edu
cator and trainer of young people.
It is worth a trip to Macon to visit
his college, and see his methods.
