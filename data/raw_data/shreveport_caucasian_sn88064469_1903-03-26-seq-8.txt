a LIVELI CHIASEi
A DESPERATE NEGRO P.RSUED
FOR EIGHT MILES.
He Was Shot and Caprtred--Died at
Hospital-OtPcer Lay and the Po
lice and Sheriff's Departments.
Dave Heard. the negro who att:empted
to kill Tom Dents, colored. a fireman.
died Monday morning from the wounds
infiicete by Officer Lay ci :he police. by
wh.:. he was pursued eight miles.
"h*e affray between Heard and Dents
occarred over a woman Sunday after
noon near Currie's Springs in the Silver
Lake Bottom, during which Dents was
shot four times.
The pursuit of Heard. in which Oti
cer Rascoe joined Lay, with Chief of
Pblice Jones, Patrolmen Adams and
Gilliland and Deputy Sheriff Mar-ma
duke Ward, was enlivened by the re
sistance offered by Heard, who in flee
ing through the brush stopped occasion
ally to shoot at Officer Lay, who was
in close pursuit After going eight miles,
Heard crossed Dixie bayou and took to
the woods followed by Lay who urged
Heard to surrender, but for reply he
received a shot which fortunately failed
in its aim. and before he could fire a
second shot Lay had responded with
an accurately directed bullet which dis
abled the fugitive. In a little while the
officers on foot and horseback were on
the scene. Heard was taken to the hos
pital, where he was operated on. He had
been shot in the abdomen and leg and
other parts of the body.
The mention of this case is to empha
size the credit which is due Chief of
Police Jones and his officers, including
Deputy Sheriff Ward, who are always
vigilant and active, and to compliment
Officer Lay on his persistent and deter
mined pursuit of a desperate negro.
armed and resisting with shots the ad
vance of the officer. A pursuit of eight
miles through the brush and woods,
across hills and dales. is an undertaking.
for which determination and nerve are
essential, and such pursuit is appre
ciated by many of the veterans of war
who have experienced such ordeals and
hardships. With an officer less deter
mined and persistent, Heard would
probably have escaped, but he soon real
ized that his only chance was to cripple
or kill his pursuer. Fortunately Lay
Swas uninjured and by his action has
placed himself in the line of merited
promotion.
And while on this subject we may
add that Shreveport has a police force
which may be ranked with the most ef
ficient, anJ a feature '-hich should not
be overlooked or underestimated is the
cordiality of the relations existing be
tween thu police and the sheriff's de
partments who co-operate ir.te:- ient.yr
in all criminal matters.
RIVER FORECAST.
Red river shows the beginning of a
fall at Shreveport in the past 24 hours.
and prospects appear fairly favorable
for continuation of slow fall during fav
orable weather.
Slight change (rise or fall possible
is expected at Fulton for another day
