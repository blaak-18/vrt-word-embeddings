POPULISM AGAIN.
To the People’s Party of Texas:
By the authority vested in me as chairman
of the People’s Party of Texas, I hereby call
a State Convention of said party to meet in
the city of Fort Worth, Texas, at 10 a. m.,
August 11, 1908, to complete the electoral
ticket for Watson and Williams, to take such
action as the convention deems best in regard
to a state, congressional, senatorial and rep
resentative ticket in every district in the state,
to elect a new state committee, a stae chair
man and secretary and such other business
as may come before the convention.
It is earnestly hoped that every county in
Texas will be represented in that convention.
I am arranging to have our candidate for
President, Hon. Thos. E. Watson, also Jay W.
Forrest of New York, as well as some others
from other states, with us. I will try to se
cure reduced railroad rates and do every
thing possible to secure a big convention.
Headquarters at Richelieu Hotel.
J. M. MALLETT,
Chairman People’s Party State Committee of
Texas.
EXPECTED.
“I hear that this corporation intends to
increase its rates to the public.”
“It was to be expected, now that its presi
dent has to pay dividends on two titled Euro
pean sons-in-law.”—Judge.
THE POLITICIAN’S WAY.
“Remember,” said the prudent man, “that
the words once spoken can never be recalled.”
“No,” answered Senator Sorghum; “but
you can always make a fuss and say you were
misquoted.”—Washington Star.
20,000 TELEGRAPH
OPERATORS NEEDED
YOUNG MEN PREPARE YOURSELVES FOR
GOOD POSITIONS.
On account of the new eight hour law
passed by congress in the interest of telegra
phers, and also on account of so many new rail
roads being built and old lines extended, an un
usual demand for operators has been created.
Conservative estimates have placed the number
of additional operators that will be required dur
ing the next ten months at approximately
20,000.

NITY! Enroll in our School NOW and in only
