A LITTLE MEJDIATOR.
How She Innooently Helped a
Bashlul Lover.
ND the young
prince married

-lived happily
e. forever after."
ably twenty, in
e a big chair, by
th the light of a
bright hearth
fire, was read
ing to a younger
LA. girl-in fact, a
little girl. The
story is con
cluded and the book closed.
"There, dear, how does that story
yen? - Don't you Wish you knew
such an interesting, handsome, noble
Sprince.as the one of whom I have just
read?"
This interrogation from the older girl
the younger one un seciously ignores
for a time. She is d ming. Hler big,
blue eyes are staring vacantly into the
red embers which have fallen from the
logs on the hearth. Then she sighs
deeply.
Waking from her reverie, she turns
those wide, wondering eyes to the face
of above her, for she is seated at the older
pOD girl's knee, and asks:
ed. "Do you know, Julia, that prince re
minds me of Mr. Mercer? Mr. Mercer
is handsome. And he's brave, too,
'cause he saved my dollie when it fell
into the lake last summer. Only"-in
a regretful tone-"he hasn't any prin
cess for his bride yet. But he will have,
'cause he said he would."
'be Oh, he did!" from the older girl.
"Yes, he did. Least, he's going to
Ith marry a queen. And isn't it strange,
,ha Julia, her name is just the same as
yours?"
"Why, child, what are you saying?
lIow do you know all this?"
"WVell," answerec the little one,
puckering her mouth in a childish,
quizzical way, "while Mr. Mercer was
waiting for you to finish dressing for
the theater the other evening, he took
me on his knee and we sat here by the
fire. I told him I was awful tired
reading fairy stories, and asked him if
p he couldn't tell me one. lie said he
thought he didn't know any 'cept
rk what's in the books, but 'course, if I
%a wanted him to he'd try."
"Yes, and what did he tell you?"
"lie said: 'Once there was a man
who liked a girl awful much, but he
was afraid to tell her so, 'cause he
didn't know how she'd take it.' And
" he said: 'By Jove, I wish she wasn't
so distant to me.' And 1 said: 'Is she
so far away?' He said: 'No, not that
" kind of distant.' 'She's not kind to
you, then?' said I. 'tYell. not kind
enough,' said he. Then I told him she
D wasn't nice if she wasn't kind, and he
said, right quick: 'Oh, yes, she is nice;
she's adorable-she's a queen.' 'WVhy,
what's her name?' said I. Well, he was in
staring in the fire, and he took a big, g,
long breath and said: 'Julia.' " II
"Yes, yes," said the older girl, very er
much interested. "Go on."
" 'Why, that's my sister's name,' I ye
said. 'Does she know her?' "
"And he jumped up so quick he really a
frightened me, but then he kissed me rr
and sat me on the edge of the table,
and said: 'Now, Joyce, I startel in to Je
tell you a fairy story, didn't 1?' en
'Yes,' said I; 'but it wasn't much a- ha
,ount.' 'I know that,' said he, awful
-quick; 'and I want you. to forget ah lhe
about it, and I'll come around some ta
5ther time and tell vou another one.' m'
'WVell, if it isn't any better than the en
one you started you needn't come,' ha
laid I. And he-why, he laughed and be
said he'd try and make the next more th

The two girls sat in quiet for a ti ne doin
without speaking, and it was becom- sere'

card: "Mr. Mercer." -

WOMEN AS FARMERS.
Tier Are 8ald to Be I'uchn Aere Suceses
ful Than MfIs.
It is said by those who claim to be in
tenr a condition to know what they are
talking about that the woman who
show takes up fruit culture, farming, ranch
Ouse. ing and stock raising will make a sue
is so ces out of it nine times out of ten.
Louse Women are, in proportion, very much
r for more successful than men, so says this
of authority, for two reasons. One is,
own, they are accustomed to sit down when
)rial, their work is done, and find entertain
hich ment in some way without going out
lioe, side for it. Another is, that they do
and not spend all of their loose change at
ther the grog-shop and the corner grocery.
It-is this constant drain on the man's
resources that keeps him continually
short. He has very little idea, if he
has ever stopped to consider the mat
ter, how much of his substance goes in
drinks, in a box of cigars here and a
little sport there. Women, for evident
reasons, do not indulge in this kind of
thing, therefore all that they collect
can be used to further the Interests in
-TBY hand. It may be said, besides, that
women are more attentive to their
business, and, naturally, very much
hole more careful of young animals and
Ln a plants and the little things that need
car- coaxing and coddling. One of the
mp. trials of the woman who prefers out-of
Loth door life is the difficulty she finds in
vith getting proper help indoors in order
i in that she may not wear herself out in
ace trying to do both kinds of work. After
and the farm and the stock have been
the cared for, she is in no condition to
11a come in and cook meals and wash
Igs. dishes and should never undertake
ing such tasks.
t of In California it is almenst the rule
oot that the women who take up out-of
ing door work make money at it. There is
oor n, reason why they should not do the
rm, same everywhere. Wherever there is
yov- land and a market, women can get a
lest good living from the soil, and can so
fli- arrange their affairs as to have an
sch abundance of leisure for study and
Its; self-improvement, as well as whatever
the amusements their environments will
the permit. Quite a number of women
:es. haven found their health entirely re
aen stored by taking up open-air ocoupa
Sis tions. One in California has set out

As a good income.

Horticulture, in all -of its branches,
is suited to women, and there are not a

THE REPUBLICAN CONSPIRACY.
0 Plotting to Undo the IVork of the Dlemo
cratl CongreLss.
e in The republicans in both houses of
are congress are putting partyism before
who patriotism as usual in these latter
slh- days.
sue- When the president sent in his special
ten. message last Monday the sound-money
,uch republicans seemed disposed to join the
this sound-money democrats in affording
is, relief to the treasury in the manner
hen proposed. They seemed disposed to
sin- admit the truth of the president's
rut- statement that the treasury was in its
rdo present predicament not because of
sat the insufficiency of the revenues, but
fry. because the laws relating to the cur
n's rency were unwise and inadequate to
ally the protection of the gold reserve.
he Now all is changed. Although less
at than a week has elapsed, and although
s in the business public has rallied to the
da support of the president with remark
ent able promptness and unanimity, we
I of are told that "the party leaders in
Leet both house and senate are firmly con
in vinced of the fact that the only difli
hat culty at present lies in a lack of rev-.
eir enue."
soh And it is more than hinted that these
tad leaders have come to an understanding
red not only that they will do whatever
the may be necessary to defeat the pro
of- posed legislation by this congress, but
in that in the next congress they will first
lr pass a bill increasing tbh tariff rates
in and refuse to do anything to improve
ter the currency system unless the presi
en dent signs that bill.
to In short, the plan is to force the
.sh president to accept a McKinley tariff
he or bankrupt the government and al
low the country to lapse to the silver
bases.
Of course, this diabolical programme
is has not been openly announced, nor
he will it be. But that it has been agreed
is upon is a fair inference from Senator
a Alliscn's recent remarks in the senate.
After referring to the fact that the
an treasury had been running behind for
ad some time he said: "The first duty of
e ongress is to raise revenues as well as
l to appropriate for necessary expenses.
The tariff bill has largely increased
the free list, and brought in foreign
articles with lowered duties. There is,
ua therefore, ample means of increasing

stead of drawing from the treasury C
reserve to pay current expenses. If a 1
n* surplus had been maintained the gold
reserve would not have been trenched c

ie Mr. Allison calmly ignores the fact li
that the treasury began to run behind d
before the end of the Harrison admin- b
istration, and Mr. Foster, Harrison's u
secretary of the treasury, had made s'
i every preparation to issue bonds under h'
the resumption. He seeks to place '
upon the democratic party the blame a
for the deficit and the run on the tress- tl
ury for gold, both of which were due al
to republican legislation, and began D
C before the close of the last republican
administration. But let that pass.
it The first thing to be done, Mr. Alli- S
son tells us, is to increase the tariff
r rates. rut he cannot expect this con
0 gress to revise the tariff upward, espe- at
cially as it will expire a month from tr
now. Ho cannot mean to postpone
remedial legislation until the new con
gress meets next December, for it will al
then be too late for such legislation, of
and there will be no excuse for increas- I
ing the tariff, because the present law tel
f will be producing revenue far in excess mi
of the expenditure. ne
It is as plain as possible, therefore, co
that the republican programme hinted s8'
at by Mr. Alld is to force an extra ses- sh.
sion by preventing the passage of any s
measure of relief this session. Then Br
the first thing, as he expressly states, 1ly
will be to revise the tariff. That, judg- tin
zng from the past, will take at least
six months. In the meantime nothing no'
whatever will be done for the protec- ooi
tion of the treasury. Probably noth- wh
ing will be done afterward, for Mr. Al- p
lison voices the republican opinion that Gr
if the income exceeded the outgo the Ha
gold reserve would not be trenched are
upon to meet the treasury notes. sio:
And so the diabolical republican tra
scheme to force McKinleyism upon the mo
country again or destroy the public uni
credit by sinking us to the silver basis tar
is completely exposed. But the scheme con
will not work. The administration WgE
will protect the treasury and the na

the resumption act. The president wil ten
not call the new congress together to the
resume the agitation of the tariff. The the

CURRENCY LEGISLATION fu

conditions. the
The most interesting fact in national as
polities is the obvious improvement in ven
the republican attitude on the currency pos
question. Heretofore the disposition wil
has been on the part of the prominent mo:
men in that party to act simply as ob- a si
structionists, to treat the grave situa- gre
tion by which the country is confront- whi
ed as a matter of interest only to the pub
democracy, and to prevent the latter- nati
so far, at least, as mere inaction would maJ
go-from any solution of the problem. whi
The effort has been, in a word, to em- its
barrass the democracy with a view to tinu
the manufacture of partisan capital; vidi
and there have not been wanting lead- -H
ers and organs to openly proclaim that
this is good politics for republicans.
Now, however, there seems to be a dis- rec
position on the part of the better class n
of republican leaders to recognize theno
fact that they have a responsibility to ma
the people as well as to the party, and oi
to lend their aid in the direction of giv- la
ing the country the financial legisla- del
tion it so much needs.
It hardly needs to be said that re- arc
publicans in congress are under oblifga- of t
tfion to pursue tlV a course, not only as mo
statesmen and public servants, butas vil

the failure to pass long since an act provid

islands, but demprehends in its loode
mindedness tae absorption of every

country which now lies under what Â§
seems to the "patriotic" the baleful . -
shadow of a foreign fag. These ab
sorptionists are great admirers of Great
SBritain's enterprise in acquiring out
lying lands and peoples. They; some
times speak of the national trait as
"greed," but it is clear that they wil.
never be truly proud of their own
country until its maw for territory
which is now the property of other
people is quite as voracious as that of
Great Britain. The assaults upon the
Hawaiian policy of the administration
are ins red by this desire for exten
sion, the gratificaion of which would
transform the nation which is now the
most potent influence in the world for
universal peace into a frowning mili
tary power, inviting war both by being
constantly prepared for it and by its
aggressions.
The plain truth is that Mr. Cleveland
has no Hawaiian policy, and the at
tempts to make the country believe
that he is plotting for a restoration of
the monarchy are not honest. Like all
honorable men whose minds are not
disturbed by dreams of territorial ex
tension, and whose patriotism has de
veloped beyond the primitive stage
when it can be gratified by a satisfac
tory count of the nation's armed men.
he believes that the part played by
Americans in office in the overthrow of
the Hawaiian monarchy was disgrace
fuL He has therefore stated that the
influence of this country was wrong
fully exerted against a weak power,
and that the wrong which was done by
the agents of the government should,
as far as possible, be repaired. We
venture to say that Mr. Cleveland's
position in this unfortunate episode
will, in time, be regarded as one of the
most courageous and honorable acts of
a singularly courageous man. If con
gress had risen to the high plane to
which the president invited it, the re
public would have taught the older
nations of the world that a governme'i
may possess the high moral q
