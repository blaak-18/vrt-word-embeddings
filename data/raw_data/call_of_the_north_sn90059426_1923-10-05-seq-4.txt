STILLWATER PEOPLE SHOW
INTEREST IN KLAN-KRAFT
Enormous Crowd Hears Robed Speaker Ex
plain the K. K. K. Movement, Nothing
Sensational Happens.
They were all there this evening, the
young, the old, the weak, the strong,
the halt the maimed and the blind; to
see what was going to happen at the
advertised meeting of the Ku Klux
Klan at the playgrounds on Wilkin
sreet, between Fifth and Everett.
And what a crowd. When the pro
gressives held the great Johnson rally
some time ago, they thought they had
broken the record for attendance at a
meeting, but it was nothing compared
with the crowd that gathered to hear
what the K. K. K. speakers had to
say.
Handbills announcing the meeting
for Thursday evening at 8:30 had
been distributed, but nQ speaker had
put in; and by that time some of these
gathered began to suspect that a prac
tical joker had been busy and put
one over on the town. Possibly from
2,500 to 3,000 people were mulling
around and the air of mystery seem
ed to get them on edge. Someone
would strike a match to light his pipe
or cigar, and immediately a bunch
would make a rush in that direction,
thinking that it was the sign for
lighting the fiery cross.
At 8:50 a car with two small Amer
ican flags in front pulled up on Ever
ett street side of the playground, con
taining two ladies and three men, one
of which was the speaker, who quick
ly slipped on a robe and hood —the
hood being minus a mask—and soon
mounted some kind of platform to ad
dress the crowd.
Mayor Coffeen and the police de
partment had made it understood that
there would be no interference with
the meeting unless something out of
the way was said, and in view of the
fact that the meetings scheduled for
Lowell park a few months ago was
not permitted to be held the crowd
was on tip-toe to hear what the speak
er would have to say, and what the
police would do. If those who had
imagined that he would start off tear
ing everything to pieces, it was no
doubt a surprise when the speaker re
moved his hood and requested those
present to remove their hats while he
offered a prayer, which he said was
the custom of the Klan in opening a
meeting.
By way of introduction the speaker
stated that the K. K. K. was a pro
testant, Christian, non-political organ
ization, which stood for the separa
tion of church and state, the public
schools, removal of the causes of mob
rule, better relations between capital
and labor, free press, free speech and
peaceful assembly.
The speaker proved to be P. J. Orn,
editor of the “Call of the North,” the
Klan paper published in St. Paul. He
dwelt principally on the public school
question, opposing elementary classes
in parochial schools, altho he said the
Klan did not oppose parochial schools
when public schools were not open.
Possibly the biggest sensation of
the meeting was the declaration by
the speaker that the Louisiana cases
of last year was a frame-up. He said
/the reason the press dropped the
story like a hot potato was that both
Richards and Daniels are alive, Dan-
els in New Orleans, and Richards in

MINNESOTA ADDRESS
P. O. Box 172, St. Paul, Minn.
State Klan Meet October 7th-SL Paul
ill* «111 l
New Mexico.
While speaking of law enforcement,
someone in the audience asked if the
Klan believed in the 18th amendment,
to which he replied that the 18th
amendment was a part of the consti
tution and the law of the land and
that the Klan believed in the enforce
ment of all the laws.
Altho there was a monstrous crowd
when the meeting opened, it soon be
gan to dwindle, as no doubt a large
part of those present came from pure
curiousity, just to see what would hap
pen, as it had been rumored that
there might be more different kinds
of fireworks than at an old time
Fourth of July celebration. But the
only thing that occurred that was out
of the way was the throwing of a few
over ripe tomatoes by someone on the
outskirts of the crowd, two of which
were said to have hit the speaker,
while some of the audience got the
rest, several ladies getting spattered,
and one young fellow standing about
fifteen feet from the speaker got one
in the face.
The climax of the meeting was the
lighting of the fiery cross on the knoll
at the corner of Martha and Wilkin
street, around which a bunch of men
and boys gathered while it burned.
In order to give its readers the
story of the Klan meeting hot off the
griddle, in case anything exciting oc
curred, part of the run of the Post
was held up so as to get the story,
but as a whole it passed off as a very
peaceable affair.
Previous to the speaking, there was
much talk regarding whether or not
the meeting should be permitted to
be held, but it seemed to be the gen
eral opinion of these heard expressing
their views that the speaker would be
permitted to speak as long as he did
not advocate violating the law. This
view was expressed by several who
are bitterly opposed to the Klan.
During and after the meeting,
copies of “The Call of the North,”
were distributed emong the crowd,
one copy of which gave Stillwater a
“razzing” on account of the Klan not
being permitted to hold the meeting
announced for Lowell park some time
ago.—Washington County Post.

without hope of personal aggrandize

“The Call of the North,” a news
paper published by the Ku Klux Klan
was pedled around the residence dis

and found this morning by citizens as
they set forth to work.
The Klan paper has a motto “Eter
nal Vigilance is the Price <sf Liberty.”
The issue which was so liberally dis
tributed around the Queen City last
night contains screaming' headlines
about Austin’s “Klanight” and gives a
lurid description of the ceremonials
there. It contains an attack on Gov.
Walton of Oklahoma and many ar
ticles caliulated to create sentiment in
favor of the Klan.—Rochester Post-

~ —K-K-K
Baltimore, Md.—About 300 mem
bers of Thomas Dixon Klan No. 1,
of Baltimore, Md., attended a meeting
held at the Klan temple in Baltimore
last Friday night. The large gather
ing was due to a summons being sent
members to the effect that a special
meeting was to be held at the hall on
Friday, September 14, for the purpose
of choosing an exalted cyclops to take
the place of Rev. James W. Ford, who
resigned ten days ago.
Best Type of Men in Race
Everything went off fine, and a man
was elected to the office of the ex
alted cyclops who is of the best type
of Klansmen. The vote was a com
pliment, as there was a man running
in opposition to him, who, like the
man honored, is also a good earnest
Klansman. The final vote gave the
winner a majority of 181. It is the
consensus of opinion that the new ex
alted cyclops of Thomas Dixon will be
a big success, and put the banner Klan
of the state of Maryland where it be
longs—on top.
Each man of the Thomas Dixon
Klan has pledged himself to give the
new presiding officer his whole-hearted
support. If this is done there can be
no doubt of the future of Thomas Dix
on Klan No. 1, of Baltimore, Md.

Milwaukee, Wis.—Under the fiery
cross and within a great square
formed by white robed and white
hooded Knights of the Invisible Em
pire, the Ku Klux Klan of Milwaukee
and surrounding cities, Saturday
night initiated a class of more than
1,000 men, while thousands of Mil
waukeeans witnessed the picturesque
ceremony.
The crowd was probably the larg
est that has ever gathered in the old
shooting park, now known as Pleas
ant Valley park, on Woodlawn ave
nue, near highway 61, and it was va
riously estimated at between 15,000
and 20,000.
Thousands' of automobiles were
parked within enclosures each one of
which had brought its load of sight
seers. Additional crowds were brought
to the park on the electric lines.
There was a speech by Dr. William
J. Mahoney, of Atlanta, Ga., imper
ial representative, in which Dr. Ma
honey took several flings at Con
gressman Victor L. Beiger, within a
stone’s throw of a restaurant in the
park conducted by Robert Buech,
former socialist sheriff.
There were approximately 2,000
robed and hooded Klansmen on the
grounds. The Klansmen, except dur
ing the initiation, were not masked.
The festivities commenced early in
the day, the afternoon being given
over to the barbecue, dancing and var
ious picnic events and the park held
several thousand persons until way
after midnight.

bership on the summit of Castle

The meeting was presided over by
the grand dragon of the Colorado
realm and was attended by a repre
sentative of the Oklahoma Klan who
discussed the situation and Governor
Walton’s war-on the Klan.
KLAN STIRS QUEEN CITY
Reiter’s administration is not all that
it should be, neither would it indicate
a satisfactory administration. The
Klan is a nation-wide movement in
which militant, alert, thinking, Amer
icans and Protestants can function
effectively for national and individual
betterment.
The Rochester “Post and Record”
states that Mayor Julius Reiter” has
been repeatedly approached and urg
ed to join the Ku Klux Klan.” If that
be true His Honor has been highly
complimented, but from what we have
learned, he has not been asked to join
the Invisible Empire.
Mr. Reiter is quoted in the Roch
ester Daily Press as follows: “Young
men (of Rochester) believe the law
courts should be the logical place to
settle things. I am glad that such a
class of young men is alive and wide
awake here.” Right there His Honor
reveals that he knows practically
nothing about the Ku Klux Klan. Yet
he has spoken glibly concerning a
great Protestant, American organiza
tion, indicting with an easy manner
millions of his fellow countrymen. He
presents no facts, offers no proof to
back his statements, the Mayor chat
ters no and on; evidently he likes to
hear himself talk. Talk is worth much
or little according to the wisdom with
which it is freighted. It seems to us,
that if we were to pay for Mayor
Reiter’s “talk” on the Klan we’d give
His Honor a German Mark and then
demand some change—a carload of
Russian Rubles.

(Special to the Call of the North.)
Saginaw, Mich.—At an American
meeting here, held by the Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan, students of the
Catholic schools formed a circle
around the speakers’ stand and hissed,
cat-called and indulged in boisterous
laughter while our national anthem
“America” was being sung.
Chief of Police McCoy, Roman
Catholic and Knight of Columbus,
when interviewed by an American
earlier in the day, said he would have
a man on the grounds to see that or
der was maintained, it is understood,
and the sheriff, who is of the same
stripe as the chief, also promised
ample protection.
None to Lead in Prayer
Instead of the crowd being com
posed of Americans, however, it
seemed that the entire force of Roman
Catholics were summoned to attend
the meet.
They surged about in an ominous
way when the speaker asked if some
one would lead in prayer and although
there were more than twelve priests
in the crowd, not one of them offered
to give a prayer for an effort that
would make America a better place in
which to live and rear children.
Among the alien opposition was
the usual strong-arm gang, it is al
leged, and one character known as
“Soap Box” Jack O’Brien, who seemed
to be one of the foreign leaders,
wanted to ask the speaker questions,
and made himself obnoxious in many
ways. The speaker offered to answer
his questions after the talk was over,
but the “soap box” was not to be
found at that time.
It was the opinion of many that
the whole affair was a concerted ef
fort on the part of the police and the
alien opposition to use their well
known rule by numbers against all
Americans and was the best eye-open
er that the Protestant citizens of this
place have ever had.
See Need of Klan
That they now know their police
heads are Catholics who are working
for the church and not for the liber
ty of free-thinking Americans, has
been pointed out here by many, and
the meeting as it was, filled with
hecklers and rowdies who want Eu
rope’s spawn of illiteracy over here
to help them thrust their ancient
policies on an enlightened world, prov
ed more conclusively to those few
Americans who were present that the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan is need
ed here.
After the meeting was over and
the speaker had returned to his hotel
the heckling by the aliens continued
over the telephone.
Sentiment for Klan
As a result of the domineering acts
by the enemies of American princi
ples, sentiment of Protestant Ameri
cans here has taken a decided trend
toward the Ku Klux Klan, and it is
conceded by many that the local or
ganization will soon be a large factor
in the affairs of the city.
Meetings have been arranged for
the near future and enthusiasm runs
high.

The Staples ball diamond was the
scene of dramatic situation Thursday
evening when a number of the Ku
Klux Klan addressed a large crowd
of over 1,200 people.
The huge trees, the beautiful moon,
all of which seemed to hover closely
and around the lot, gave a location
suitable for any dramatic play. As
one stood in the center of the lot there
was a feeling of being in a huge
amphitheater.
For those who are inclined to be
sentimental the beautiful setting of
that occasion would give them the
feeling of wanting to forget their
troubles, worries and griefs and just
drink in the fresh invigorating air
and gaze at the moon with intent eyes.
The situation seemed to hold the
crowd spellbound and when the Klans
man appeared in his white robe there
was a feeling of mystery that crept
over them. For the Klan, who have
always been more or less of a mys
tery, the feeling of mystery that hung
over the place, the beautiful moon
light evening, the huge trees, the
location, could have not been excelled.
The nickname of the speaker was
also rather fitting, “Twi-light.”
Two saw horses and a wide board
formed the platform from which the
Klansman spoke.—Stillwater Messen
