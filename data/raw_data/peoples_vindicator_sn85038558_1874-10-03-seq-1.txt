ADDRESS OF THE of
People of the Parish of Natchi- ju
toohes, to their Fellow-Citi- ti
zens of the State and in
Union. s1
In common with their Fellow-citi- ei
zens throughout the State, the peo- ti
ple of the Parish of Natchitoches have T
borne the evils of bad government di
and usurpation of authority, until p
their rights of pe.rson and property, fi
and all their franchises have been th
trampled upon, their substantial in- tl
terests become the prey of official al
plunderers sustained and protected U
by venal, corrupt and ignorant judges, to
who have prostituted courts efjius- T
tice in order to perpetuate partisan ti
rule and private schemes at the sac- W
rifice of legal and equitable rights, at
their Parochial affairs confided to the ei
control of unlettered tools of unscrn- :1
pnlous persons, until taxation has be
come insupportable and poverty is di
at their doors. False statements 0l
have been made and incendiary ap- it
peals to passion and prejudice in- p
dulged in, by these bad men, for the g
purpose of arraying, in hostility, one g
class of our population against an- v
other, in order to sustain these out- a
rages, at the expense of peace and r;
prosperity. h
Preferring to bear these evils pa- t.
tiently, rather than resort to violence c
and forcible retistance to those who ti
bore even the semblance of legal an- si
thority, while, in truth, they were tl
but usurpers and the creatures of n
usupatiou, they submitted to their a
wrongs, until continued forbearance o
would have resulted in a virtual o
abandonment of every right of free- o
men and submission to base and ty- a
rannous oppression.
With the courts practically closed p
to legal redress, on account of judi- a
cial positions being filled by corrupt g
men, the ballot futile, by reason of t
the acts of corrupt and irresponsible o
Supervisors and Returning Boards, g
whose powers are absolute and the lI
measure of whose fitness is loy- t
alty to party and faction, yield t
ing to the natural instincts of a
self preservation and animated
by a sense of duty to themselves
and their families, the people of
Natchitoches, regardless of past
political ties and associations, com
prising the representatives of pro
perty, intelligence and honesty, op
posed to fraud and corruption, and
acting in the interest of outraged
public opinion- and violated rights,
assembled in Mass Meeting; peacea
bly, and demanded the resignation
of the offices held by these bad men
whose acts disgraced their official
positions. This demand was, in most
instances, complied with without de
lay or hesitation and where not com
plied with, the incumbents stealthily
left the parish and still remain ab
sent, their cowardly consciences caus
ing them to flee from imaginary dan
ger, while at a distance they vilely
misrepresent the people whom they
bare plundered and abused, basely
drawing salaries which they do not
earn, and riotusly living upon the
wages of their own iniquity.
Not only believing, but knowing,
that, the parish officers of Natchito
ches, voted for on the Fusion ticket,
were legally elected in 1872, and'
these ofi8cers being, then, as now, the
Schoice of a lage majority of the peo
pie, they ha~e been installed ainto
their respective positions by the act
and at the hahds of the people, and
that people hold, that, it is the solemn
duty of the ofcers so installed to re
tain their posi ions and exercise their
official functons; and should the
usurping 8taf dynasty, called the
r Kellogg gover meut attempt to oust
them by forcei they owe it to those
who tave el cted them and to the
purity and santity of the ballot box,
to resist the oCinions of the usurper
to the bitter ed.
Among the iany instances of total
a disregard of lar and of a fixed deter
n mination to persist in his aggressions
upon the right4 of this people, they
cite the followibg acts of the usurper
Kellogg, whichi directly tend to the
subversion of gd government and
to the perpetntion of his arbitrary
usurpation. By the act of his own
Legislature, which receives his ap
proval and signature, the 17th Ju
ish is situated) was established,
and by his own appointment a
corrupt and prostitute Judge and
an incompetent District Attorney
were placed in b8fee in that District;
these men have left their posts, un
able to face the scorn and indignation
of an injured people, and although the
very law, creating this district, requir
ed, that, an election for thee officers
.should be ordered by the Governor
'and should be held at the approach
, ing general election in November,
1874, he has ignored this plain pro
vision of the law, withheld the order
a which he is required to issue, thus
clearly evineing his determination to
Sforce,upon she District the miser.ble
creatures of his appointment.
Again : The law requires that the
members of the Police Juries, which
bodies control all Parochial affairs in
m the several Parishes, shonld be eleqted
all by the people of the Parishes at each
biennial general election, yet he has
also ignored that legal requirement
and wtbbeld the call for the election
of these officers, thus foreshadowing
his policy of doing in the futureas he
has done in the past: foisting upon
the Parishes corrupt and ignorant de
men, the miserable tools of his local to
satellites and petty leaders, to
Expressions of loyalty to the Fed- C(
eral government are so commnon that ei;
they have become tame and trite. ii
The people of this Parish do not wl
deem it necessary to indulge in loud at
protestations of their loyalty. Ever tit
since the surrender at Appomatox
they have demonstrated by their acts el
their allegiance to the Constitution ti
and their obedience to the laws of the at
United States and they have manifes-.
ted none other than loyal feelings w
They certainly have no desire to array SI
themselves against the Union or to eC
Wage war against it; but, they pos- w
seas, under the Constitution and laws, tl1
equlid rights with the citizens of of
Maine, Ohio, or any other State. ni
In the exercise of these rights, they ni
deny the legal power of the President PI
of the United States to interfere by ti,
military force, in the State or its tip
parishes, to overthrow a rightful nI
government or deny the right of self bi
government, and should he in plain
violation of, or indifference to, firnd- thi
ameital law, interfere, by such milita te
ry power, the question becomes no fo
longer local but of National impor. til
tance, as being subversive of the prin-. g
ciples contained in the great declara- w
tion of rights, which nearly a century di
since gave birth to this Nation, and ec
this people will only yield to over- C
whelhing Federal force, and they B
appeal to their countrymen through- re
out the whole Union, in the name 1
of their virtue and intelligence, hi
of their veneration of that Declar- ma
ation of American Independence a
whose centenni~l anniversary they are el
preparing to celebrate with imperial b
splendor, of their memory of those t
grand men who pledged "their lives, G
their fortunes and their sacred hon- h
ors" to give then the right of self o
government, to come to our help and a
by all moral means aid us in vindica- a
ting the purity of the ballot, the sanc- al
tity of the Judiciary, and the cause ii
of honesty and justice. ii

Don't use a hard pencil. At least o
that is the advice of the Evansville, I
Indiana, benedict gives his friends.
He explains thus: His wife desired t
him to write a note to certain lady,
t inviting her to meet a party of friends
e at their house. After "hubby" had e
done as his wife desired, and started
to post the note, shie saw on another
piece of paper an impression of what
he had written, It was : "Sweet Mat- I
a tie, Eflle desires your company on .
SWednesday, to meet the Smithets. I
Don't fail to come, and then my dar
Sling, I shall have the happiness of s
long walk home with you, and a sweet
Sgood night kiss. I dare not see you I
Soften, or my all-consuming love would 1
betray us both. But Mattie, dear,
irdon't fail to come." The wife paid
e '"sweet Mattie" a visit, and the result 1
e was thlattIatie did't accept the kind
invitation.

ir- the window. The report was like a

Pi'odu]cethe Documents. F;
During our latej war for'indepen
dence, among the other ;tirphtlt cap
tured were a large number of letters tel
to Kellogg from prominent Radical so
Congressmen and Government olfi- ate
eials,Eimplicatiug them in the most $ý
intfamous manner with the usurpation, lij
which they have labored so earnestly ,tu
and so successfully, thus far, to main- es
tain.
What persons have these letters in ca
charge we do not know, but we know j,
that they should be made public at a,
once. of
They are the property of the people gi
who fought for the redemption of the as
State, and they will doubtless play a th
conspicuous part in the grant'trnggle st,
which we are making for freedom. lb
they implicate some of the highest ,,
officials in this Government in a man- in
ner that.makesli the usurpation even f,
more detestable titan ever, as they p
prove that, in sustaining it, othicers of
the Government'and Senators of na
tional reputation have been actuated
not by principle and hilt motives, hi
but by mote. tt h
Kellogg's greenbacks thave settled w,
the matter, and the In piration of the m
temendous orations and labored ef- g
forts that have been made to sustain th
the usurpation in the halls of Con- ihe
gress has been money. These letters, pr
which we know to have been captured
during the late war against Kellogg,
contain absolute proof that Morton, th
Caleb Cushing, Matt Carpenter, Ben sa
Butler, and others whose names we to
reserve for the present, have been fu
Mit. Kellogg's hired servants, and de
have received front him large sums of fo
money for aiding in perpetuating the st
most daumning outrage upon free gov- cc
erOmeut that has ever been concocted ci
by demagogues and thieves sand up. ea
held by the;bayonets3 of the, Central oi
Government. The policy of with- pl
holding these documentary evidences hi
of the criminal implication of the pl
magnates in Washington with the b;
usurpation is a mistaken one, they se
should be given to the world at once ci
in order that the world may know the g
influences which have worked against ti
usiand may consign the corrupt and d
depraved men who control the Gov- co
erinmeut to the everlasting infamy 3
which they so richly deserve.-N. 0. a

A few days since an attorney call

fession and asked his opinion vtilon
a certain point of law. The kSwyer
Sto whom the question was addressed
drew himself up and said: 'I general
d lyv get paid for telling whht I know.'
The questioner thereupon drew a half
' dollar 'fractional' from his pocket,

marked; "Tell me all you know and
give the change." There is a cold

Goon BEEF CHEAPER TiAS POOR.
--In market quotations of our wes
ter:d towns, we find cattle quoted
something like this: Good shipping
steers, $3.50 to $8.50 j butehers stock,
$a3.:0 to 4.50. Now why is it that,
livihg as western people do, where so
many cattle are bred, they should
eat to much poor beef It is because
such quotations as the above indi
cate that the poor beef is cheapest.
But this is not true. A well-fatted
anim al, weighing 1,400 to 1,600 lbs.,
of sanall bone and line quality, will
givei us more eatable meat for the
same money at $6l50 per hundred,
than, a thin, coarse-boned old cow or
steer, weighing fromn 900 to 1,100
lbs., `t $3.50 to $4.50 per 100. This
was illustrated not long since by an
inveltigation made into the manage
mteut of one of our western state
prisons. It was charged that the
prisoners had better beef than the
people of the city. This the super
inten'lent did not deny, for he said
his p irpose had always been. to buy
the best cattle in the market; and
we uiaderstand that he actually de
monstrated by the accounts and
figurds carefully kept of purchases,
the g'oss and net weights, ate., that
he saited money to the state by the
practice.--Live Stock Journal.
STIbK A PIN IEBnE.-The result of
the Augusta cotton factory enterprise,
says the New York Sun, are such as
to en.onrage the Southern people to
furth4r effects in manufacturing. The
depesidence of the South on the North
for iMunufactured products was shown
strikitgly during the war, whga, with
cottot in abundance, the wealthiest
citixens were obliged to purchase at
enor ous gold prices clothing brought
over n blockade runners, while the
poore classes wore the roughest of
home pan. Since the war several
prais-worthy efforts have been made
by So thern capitalists to make their
sectiot independent. The most sue.
cessfl of those enterprises is the Au
gustajeotton factory, started soon af
ter the war. Only sixty thousand
dollata were ever paid in, and the
company has paid out in dividends
1 ,0 000, has property $1,200,000,
at the lowest calculation, and a sur
plus 4f $265,860. During the fiscal
year just ended the company expend
ed $5f0,000 for new machinery and
for emlargement and improvement of
the uildings. Yet Georgia only
conesu es 25,000 bales of cotton in
her milis, about one twentieth patt of
her o n crop, while most of the other
Southprn States are without cotton
mills,land have to send their whole
crop lsewlhere to be manufactured.
The New Orleans "Picayune's"
comnmercial article of September 1st
s says :
Witu reference to the growing crop,
Iwe may state that the acerage put
under cultivation this year was 'ace
cording to the Agricultural Bureau
report for Jane, only 8,746,791 acres,
againe 9,885,210 in 1873--a decrease
of 1,1 8,419 acres or II per cent.
The plýanting was very late, and the
crop iq the early spring ten to two
weeks backward. Favorable wet
or however forced the growth rapis
I ly and in July the condition was bet
Ste thad last year in all the States.
SSinee then a severe and protracted
s drouth has caused much damage by
.the sh~lding of forms, and at the
Spresen~ time the trade is so much in
I doubt that there is a general disposi.
altion to await further developments
I before snaking estimates of the crop.
