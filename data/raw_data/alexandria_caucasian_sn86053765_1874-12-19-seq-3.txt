The Eoginning of the End.
fFrnin the New Orleans Bulletin.)
Wlicn wo asserted some tir •> apo
t-liat Hie Upturning Hoard lim. heeti
created and its membres appointed
for the solo purpose of defeating
I lie popular will, as expressed at the
polls on the seeond of November ■
when we told the Democratic Cîen
tral Committee that they should
sternly ignore that packed and cor
rnpt body, and should absolutely
refuse to touch the unclean thing,
the journalistic Miss Nancys of the
so-called < 'ouserval ive press of this
city, with their usual anil inveter
ate trimming and time serving pro
clivities, protested against our
course as onecalculated to do great
injury to the cause they profess to
have at heart, and as manifestly
unjust to the fair-spoken and fair
minded men constituting the lie
turning Board.
In deference to the wishes of some
of our over credulous friend««, wo
abstained from pressing the point,
and patiently waited for further de
velopments, The result is now be
tore us, and the plot denounced by
us in advance now stands revealed
in all its naked deformity. After
dilly-dallying as long as they
could with the returns, and pro
claiming as elected a sufficient.num
ber of Radical members to secure to
that defeated faction a plurality in
bare quorum, they are now at
work eliminating ami absolutely re
jecting the votes of the entire par
ises that have give large Conserv
ative majorities, and the intention
is distinctly aunouued by Wells,
fVnderson & Co., of referring con
tested cases to the adjudication of
t he rvmp Legislature they ha'vo till
'impudence to presume the (»copie
of Loiiisiana will recognize as a
legitimate body.
That they will lie most awfully
disappointed in that foolish and
criminal attempt no sane individu
ul can possibly entertain the slight
est doubt. The presence of United
States troops in this city may in
spire these men with some degree
of boldness, but like Bob Acre's
valor, their courage will ooze out
at tho critical moment, and the
great National Honse of licfuge
will again become a hoarding-house
for frightened carpet baggers and
swii't-footed scalawags. The ballot
box stulfers and supervising pimps
have done their dirty work—the
prevaricating Returning Board is
now engaged in giving a quasi legal
indorsement to the stupendous
fraud—and we are fast approach
ing THE BEGINNING OF Til Ii END !
A. Puzzled and Indignant V/itnoss.
They were trying a "horse case"
in court the other day, and the law
yer was questioning a witness in
reference to the animals habits'and
Imposition. "Have you ever driv
en her?" was asked. "I have,"
was tho reply. "Was there any
one with you tit the tiineT' was the
next question. "There was a lad.v
with tue," tho witness answered,
and he blushed a little. "Was she
a. good driver V was tho next ques
tion, the la wyer referring to the an
inial, hut the witness understood
that he meant the lady. "She
was," he replied. "Was she gen
tle and kind ?" asked the 1 i in i », and
flic reply was iu the affirmative,T
though Ilm witni ss, still thinking
of I l.o lady, looked iililll« surprised
"She didn't, kick!" was the next in
tcrro^ation, and a derisive "No"
was the answer. u K!i<! didn't rear
up or kick over the traites, or put
her hind leet through the traces, or
try to run away, or act ugly, Or—"
tho witness was boiling over with
indignation by this time, and inter
rupted the lawyer with, "Do you
mean the horse or the lady V' "I
mean the mare we were
about," thundered the counsel.—
"Oil !" was the response, "i thought
you meant the gal." And with this
explanation, the pursuit of justice
was resumed.— \I'iltxjicld f.Mas.s.)
