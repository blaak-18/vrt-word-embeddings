It is a serious question with us ionsl
whether those persons who edit lead- are v
ing journals, which are supposed to lower
reflect public opinion, properly un Itapp
derstand what a republic is. We ofA
have for a long time been troubled after
with this idea and the late utterances
of such journals as the Herald and we r
the Sun seem to justify our doubts. lt
In a pure democracy, such as ours of
is claimed to be, the sovereign pow- ablii
er is hleld to be vested in the fran- right
chised citizens. A large body of our othel
people held the opinion that this pow- 2d
er was not directly delegated to the ica
National powers, but indirectly, the I
through the representatives of the Unit
people in their local capacities, the 4th
States. But even those who held
such views have never denied that
the PEOPLE were sovereign. Now the thro
Sun and Herald statesmen prealnt a

new idea in Republican America and the
which we fail to find enunciated in hith
any work on government we have of i.
been able to find-that "order and
peace" are paramount to human 4t
rights and liberty ; forgetting the out
fact that no peace or order can or of ct
will exist without either ; submission acts
may, grant you, but peace and order, tion
never!
If the sovereign power rests with 5t
the people how can their will as ex- of
pressed by the franchised citizen at of g
the ballot box be overthrown witl Thu
impunity and that pawer be told to mar
submit I The fact of the people re
sisting is not nor can it be made to cell
appear revolution. On the contrary, nat
when individuals, to whom are del
egated certain powers by the people, if I
overstep the prescribed bounds, it is Roi
the delegate that revolts not the sov- lof
ereigo-for the sorereign can never be hod
in rebellion. We hold and on the
hypothesis defy an answer, that the the
whole Republican fabric of this or for
r any other Democratic or mixed gov- lic
ernment rests upon the right of resist- rm
ance. There can be no quibbling
over such fact. For in our own hearts lin
the impulse springs up uncalled for cru
' to resist any encroachment upon what us
w' e know to be our rights.
Lord Brougham says: "The right
of resistance is the foundation, and it get
is of necessity the foundaition of all of
popular and mixed government." The
encroachments of the ruler upon the
n rights of the subject, his ruling in
defiance of law, and trampling upon M
the liberties which the constitution se
cures the people is a full justification m,
)f of resistance to his authority."
And further he says: ha
in "As the people cannot resist by the 9e
form of law because the ruler is sup
. posed to set it at defiance, so he can- ti
not constrain the people by these as
forms when their proceedin gs are d- so
G- together lawless." P:
lo We could quote authority ad libi- sit
a tumrn but this is sufficient for the points W
le we desire to illustrate. The Sun and
Herald admit that the act in count- cn
ing in Hayes is arbitrary fraudulent a
s and revolutionary (the latter we take a
SI isi the fatal admission in their ar
- mor of argument for submission) but o0
W they add that "the people must sub- oi
mit" because peace is paramount to
liberty. Thie deduction is totally
u natural and so revolting to common
o intelligence as to be almost disgust- N
ing. a
at Resistance is the foundation of this
government and when that right and
m power is yielded the government ends,
- and nothing can be better established
than the fact that if the American C
Ssovereign (the people) submit for the
r. sake of quiet to this rude sundering of
the constitution with the hope of
t defeating their delegated rulers in t
1878 or 1880 they are undone. t
i No 1878 or 1880 election morn will
ever come for them-nor should it.
en For we contend that if the people
now submit; now yield the basis of
their government, resistance, they
should be, for the sake of quiet and
Iet aubmnission, centralized as fast as pos
sial ible and bound in one strong gov
ernment under the mailed hand of
some ambitious master with the great
est speed.

brass Brougham sweeps away all sueach

dish up when he esys, as we have al
and ready quoted, that the "peopie cannot

also this answers that appeal to the

The Don Quixote of modern times, or on
resides in the parish of Red River.
His name is B. W. Marston, and woe own
be unto the person that dares "tread langO
oi the tail of the coat of that Twitch- what
ell cursed section." The moment it inh
is done Don Marston lowers his vi- pubt
sor, poises his lance, and in the tilt we h
the chances are ten to one that the word
Don is knocked "flat aback." At not
least, the average is decidedly against to th
the Don, so far, and we are pained to
chronicle the fact, that another of just
their unhorsing accidents befell the lng

ish as public enemies, worse than
radicals-Marston rushes to the front tr of
and, with as much noise as a Chinese then
warrior, takes a tilt in honor and lecth
defence of what he calls the domes- lo i
tic affairs of Red River parish." If reseI
the butt end of Marston's lance has d
not unhorsed him, then moen of sense T
have been laughing for no cause. w
We propose to treat the advances iatv
of Quixote Marston in the most seri- of
ous manner, from the fact that he is for
disposed to arrogate to himself so in t
much kt.owlede and so much Demo
cracy, to whi:lh we have no objection,
while at the same time he denounces
others for want of both.
Want of brains may be our misfor- e
tune, and in admitting it we beg also geto
to state that we will not go to Mars- tim
ton to acquire them, but our Demo- te
cracy we leave not to his judgment or
To all of which we beg leave to add, r.
we will not so far forget the common
C courtesies of gentility as to use lan- stri
guage unbecoming the pleasures or
rules of ociot3.
But to the subject of Mr. Marston's
e Quixotic tilt, which we propose to
consider so far as it affects the Dc
me ocracy of this Scnatorial an:l Judi
" cial District, of which we have a per- S
r feet right to treat. Mr. Marston says:
I 1st., That 290 Democrats, willed in
'1 against 209, including Mr. Marston, thi
r. and he further admits that the 209 ele
refused to submit to what other peo ro'
ple than he would term the will of nol
the majority, but which is termed do0
by hint "the party lash." ele
We submit in all candor to an im
partial public, if that be Democracy. l
Mr. Marston submits his claims to Bo
t a Democratic Senatorial Convention, inj
me and thereby assumes the party har- tic
oe ness. This Convention did not con- joi
o sider his claims, which was no fault mi
of Mr. Marston's from his own show- pa
c- ing, and because they did not, he im.- ci
)u mediately assumes an "Independent St
line," and denounces the "party lash." 0
i We submit also to the public if that hl
n- is Democracy 0 o
or Mr. Marston tacitly admits that HE ds
n was defeated by the majority of the v
l Democrats of Red River parish for cl
n Delegate to the Baton Rouge Con- a@
ot vention, and as a candidate for State
n Senator in the 22d Senatorial District,
and adds he, "there is where the dis- t
o organization began in this (Red ci
River) parish."
That is certainly and decidedly i
very cool. This dikorganization of the
he Democracy of Red River, began when aC
majority of the Democrats of that par- .
ish refused to recognize the claims of 7
,Mfr. Marston is all that a just public (
can ever deduce from Mr. Marstou's a
own showing. In other words, Mr.
vc- Marstou in a spirit of unpardonable
egotism, assumes himself and follow
ers, a clear minority of the people, to
be infallible Democrats against whom e
of it were trecson for the majority to I
er vote. That we do no violence to facts 1
er in drawing suech a conclusion, the
very language he uses shows.
Now we beg to submit this also to i
Sthe public for judgment.
We do not know, nor do we care,
so long as Mr. Marseton is anxious
rle we should not, what gratitude the
Uce people of Ied River owe him. But
we will be pardoned for saying that,
new from Mr. Marston's own showing, the
at only "Reform, solid fight he was
willing to make against Radicalism
was to be nuder his banner, and as a
further reason for one thus obtruding
the upon the "domestic concerns of Red
who River," we have but to quote his final
ov- threat. "What does the Coushatta
Democracy want t What does the
resh Vindicator want Would they drive
some of the best men, this or any
other parish has, to the Radical
DI- camp."
.877, That certainly sounds like the lan
egs- guage of a PATRIOT, wChO fiJhts for
give principle, and is alone sufficiept to
i-e condemn Mr. Marston in the eyes of
;hoir men.
Hear him: "What is the so-called
Coushatta Democracy trying to ac

For the past ten days, we have had
r- a full exhibit of the farce of Radical
government. The question is one
o now simply of self- protection, as the
thieving, blackguard, characterless,
cowardly officials canto nothing, nor
will they do anything to protect life
or property. The "To::as boys" who
t took the town last week, brutally
on shot a negro man, breaking his arm,
and not an officer of the law raised
is- his official voice or power to punish
e- the evil doers. Day after day the
town presents a scene sickening to c1
behold-drunken men flourishing pis
to tls and with dononl!ic yell;, threat- l
e- ciing death to any man that "opens tl
o his chops." The olfficers(f) all rush (
nt home,'and are fast locked up in bed
re rooms quaking as if with the ague at o
every yell. And this is but the open- t
ing of tihe reign of anarchy which the
Packard usurpation will surely phJlge
this country into.
