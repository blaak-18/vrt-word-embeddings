Reply tt Rufus Knott.
Editor La. Populist :
Dear Sir-I had hoped for the 'ý
sake of the general peace of the t
ward, that I would not he called n
upon to seek the columns of the c
public press again to answer the o
vituperation of a "blatherskite," t,
but the "boss liar" of this ward, n
one Rufus Knott, has forced me o
into print in self defence. I s
As will be seen by the following c
certificates, I am justified in call- i
_ ing hint the "lw liar," if noth- ,
ing harsher, and that if his letter i,
had had only a local circulation. I (
would have treated it as the Irish- i,
man did the "Johnny hoss" that i
kicked him, i. e., c3nsilered the ,
source,"-but as the facts ar' not I
generally known in the 1arish and r
State, it behooves me to disprove 1i
his innocndoes and to show to the I
pubhe the manner of person he is, I
by the testimony of men, good and
true, who have known him from c
boyhood; several of whom are
closely related to him by the ties of
blood and marriage.
I am exceedingly sorry that he e
has forced me to expose him, on t
account of his wife and children, i
who, I am happy to state, enjoy j
the esteem and respect of the entire t
community and are in no way re
Lected upon in this article.
I m also grieved and astonished
to see that the Enterprise, the or
gan of the "pure and undefiled
Democracy" of the parish has con
verted its columns into a sewer
pipe, and allows itself to be used t
as such by deluging its readers with t
- any filth which may eminate from
r disrputable and vile sources, and t
poures through its columns. ,
I would advise the lady propre
I tree to put the editorial helm into
the hands of persons who have,
some respect for decency of their
publications and a regard for her
s pecuniary interest.

To whom it may concern:
Thi. is to certify that we, the
undersglned, know of our own
knowledgle that Prof. J. E. Selby
was apnointedt, against his will by 1
the Quartcrly Conference as super
intendent of the M. E. South Sun
day school at Beulah, and servedl
in that capacity about one year, n
and that there was not a cent in I
the treasury of said school when s
he took charge and that nearly one t
half of the expense was borne by
said superintendent from his own e
private means. We further know
that Prof. Selby joined the church
on prolbation, anti never even pre
tended to have been converted, nor
can he be justly accused of hypoc
racy.

Next he refers to certain oblia
tions as if it were a crime. He
seems to forget that he is indebt
ed to the writer for all the educa- t
tion which his children Ipossess,
never having paid a cent for tui
tion, except thirty-six (36) lbs. of
a "sow-belly," and the use of his ox
team four (4) days, this is the only
1 recompense the writer has ever re
C coived for the instruction of four
or five pupils for two or three
terms, and he also forgets that his
notes are not worth the paper up
on which they are written, unless
signed by his wife. Mr. Harris
r Simon of your city can give some
interesting information on this
score, if he will. Again, if you
r will ex umine the records of the
I Clerk's office as to the ownership
of the real estate claimed by him
t in this ward, you will not find a
e solitary acre to which I. J. W.
Knott holds a title. That is the
reas m I have not been able to col
c lect a debt for services rendered.
e You know the adage, "sue a beg
I ger and get a louse."
Business men do not care to sign
n certificates, but any and all persons
e who wish to know as to howl
I stand with the business men of
my town and elsewhere, and wheth
e er I am responsible for my con
!tracts, are referred to Messrs. G.
" W. Small, Win. Jackson, F. W.
V E. Truly, T. J. Jackson of Mar
e thaville, and Messrs. J. R. Fuller,
White & Harris and Heard Bros.
of Shilob, La.
H1 Ie next asks me how many times
I have voted in this parish, and
d accuses me of being hldden away
- in the gambling halls of Natchito
r ehos during the election; the cer
d tificate of Mr. A. S. James proves
b that I was in Natchitoches in Jan
Snary of '92 and not in April and
d that was the last time I was there
until 1894. He further accuses me
D of sacrificing a gold watch during
0 mS stay in your city; the only gold
e watch that I have owned since my
r residence in this State, was lost by
r my daughter between my house
and Beulah church, in the summer
or early fall of 1894.
I did not go to the polls in April
HO of '92, simply because I could not
Sswallow either of the tickets in the
SelId, with McEnery and lottery
! thievery on the one hand, and
SFoster and political thievery on the
r other.
' Next he accuses me of attempt
Slug to swindle a gentleman out of
Sa well auger, this lie is also nailed
by a certificate.
4 To whom it may concern :
This is to certify that the asser
* tion made by Rufus Knott, that J.
.t E, Selby attempted to swindle me
I out of a well auger, is falso and

To whom it may concern :
This is to certify that the under
signed Trustee of Rocky Springs
I chool, Sabine parish, know, of A
my (iwn knowletdge, that Prof. .1.
E. Selby discontinued the said
school of his own free will, and 'I
that there was nothing of an un
Spleasant nature between said teach
er and the patrons or trustees of
said school, and that a majority of
the patrons endeavored to prevail
upl)n said teacher to teach the school
to the termination of term.

He claims to have always been a
Democrat, and says he is the son
of a Democrat.
It can be proven that he made
three public addresses to the ne
groes, advocating Populism, and F
that he has voted the Populist
ticket once, if not oftener. Fur
f thor, his father is a Populist, andt
voted for Bailey for Cnngress, andti n
the ticket headed by Pharr in the a
late election. h
As to whether I am a "full-blood- t
e ed Pop" the readers of this paper 4
must judge for themselves.
He winds up his fabric of men
dacity by offering to "make any
s apology necessary" upon certain i
conditions, all I have to say in re- i
Sgard to this proposition is that I
have no retractions to make and if
in any of my communications he
tinds a cap to fit him, he mlust wear
n it,; in other words, if I have said t
anything I am sorry for, I am glad
of it.
I dislike to deal in personalities, 1
but as it .is a poor rule that will
not work both ways, I will fight
him with his own weapons by ex
posing his "peccadilloes." In the
firstplace he dragged his good wife
off of her knees from the altar of
Beulah church, and by brute force
f compelled her to leave the church,
this was during services, and in the
presence of 75 or 100 people:
He went to his brother-in-laws
house and while the family were at
prayer stood at the door and cursed
and abused the family.
He attempted to place the crime
of hog stealing on a poor old ne
gro, by slipping marked hog's cars
d into.the nmger's meat barrel. A
necessity arose to place the guilt
somewhere, as suspicion was point
ing in his direction, 'The Grand
Jury failed to find a bil.
His father publicly states that he
robbed him of a large sum of mon
e ey, in the night time, and that to
e escape presecution, he returned it.
One of his relatives by marriage
is willing to make affidavit that
Knott gave him drugged liquor,
y and while in a state of insensibility
's robbed him of thirty-five (a35 00)
dollars. A nice fellow to call men
who voted against the ring admin
istration "nigger-pops."
In another- instance when he
thought Mr. Berry Varnon was on
his death-bed he forged his name
to an order and collected the mon
e y. Mr. G. W. Small of Matha
ville, can give the particulars.
He committed a forcible trespass
on the property of a resident of
your city by removing somebuild
mngs an ppropriating them to his
own use. Mr. Harris Simon can
enlighten those who doubt the
truth of this assertion, and can ex
ain the lively interest exhiMited
Rufls Knott in his Texas rela
d taves about this time.
Mr. Solomon Prothro of Robe
line, has a written instrument
known as a "Lie-Bill" which bears
the signature of Rufus Knott. *
in It is reported on good authority
t that he promsed two negro school
, teachers, that when he was gom
missioned a member of the School
SBoard, that he would use' his in
luence as such to have them chosen
as teachers fur a consideration,
vis : fifty per cent of their salary.

may he asked, that if h11 has been
as criminal as here represented.
how he has escapjed the clutches of
the law, it can only IK accounted Ii
for, from the fact that he has a d
good father, a man who is resplect- ,
ed for his integrity, and for his
sake and the sake of his wife, who
is a christian lady, this scoundrel
has escapedl prosecution. o
Again, it may be asked, know- d
ing as he did the damuning deeds
which could be proved against him ; i
why he rished into print to attack
the character of any man e That I
can be answered only in this way :
that to curry favor with the Ring I
he would do dirty work at any risk ii
with the hope, and perhaps the a
promise of some '-pie," and Is
sides you have heard that "Fools "
rush in where angels fear to t read." i"
It was. told hy a well known N
Democrat of this ward the day af- t
ter the public speaking at Allen by a
Messrs. Breazeale and Fleming that
Knott was induced to withdraw his i
name as candidate for police juror
of this ward on the Democratic
ticket against G. L. Glass, upon t
the promise of the appointment as
member of the School Board, the
° truth of which has heen verifiled.
This communication is getting
too long, but one entire lige of
yourpaper could lie filled with the
crimes of this fellow, and still not
be all told. I shall still continue
to collect evidence; and in case he
should be fool enough to try to
e vindicate himself, I will be prepar
ed to prove all contained in this
letter and much more by sworn af
fidavits of unimpeachahbl witnesse.
C I will close by intrtwucing a gen
t eral certificate signed by somn of
the best men of the ward.
To whom it may concern:
This is to certify that we, citizens
of Natchitoches parish are person
ally acquainted with J. E. Selby,
having known him for a number of
years, and know him to be a gen
tleman by reputation, conduct and
e education.
' Further, we also know that the
writer of a certain communication
in the Enterprise of July 2nd, viz :
a Rufus Knott, is a person who oc
Scupies a very low round on the
social ladder; whose reputation
a for truth and honesty is at a very
low ebb, and whose opinions and
e communications are not worthy of
notice.
d Further, that the accusations
made by said Knott against .J, E.
Selby in the Enterprise are a dense
fabric of falsehoods and nisropre
Ssentations from beginning to end,
and have no weight where the two
parties are known.
