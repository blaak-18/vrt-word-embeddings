B RUIN'S QUEER HABITS.

The One of the mot ourious things about
the black ~hear (and the grizzly and
e.innamon also) is the way he goes into
S g winter quarters when whiter has
and fairly set in, and lies dormant in his
den without either eating or drinking
e OC until the next Apring. This is called
mnoe hibernation; and during this period a
te the ordinary processes of digestion
ir. seem to be entirely suspended. In our
eed semi-tropies bears do not hibernate,
yen- but nature undoubtedly planted this
instinct in the brain of the bear of the t
or north to enable him to survive the se
vere winter period when the snows lie
et* deep, and all food is so scarce that
otherwise he would be in danger of
alty starvation. This period of hibernation
Sis from about the middle of December
to the middle of March. It has been
ot stated that i bears have plenty of food
they will not hibernate, even in the
and north, but this is a mistake. I know

Those who have skill in painting

The morning glories, or other flowers, m

colors are to be used, let a piece of ti
