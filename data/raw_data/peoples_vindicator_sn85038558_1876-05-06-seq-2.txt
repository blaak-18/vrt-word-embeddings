being. seen in the balmy month of
May, in. this latitude. It seems
strange, but no less true, for we have
seen the effects of it on vegetation,

brought into our office a young pea
vine with the leaves dead and crisp
from the effects of the frost.
The amercury stood Wednesday, 3d,
48°. (F.) at daylight, consequently it
was not cold enough to do any se

Our Choice for Governor,
We have heard it said that the
Iindicator and one other paper in the I
c~mntry parishes, were the on.y. two, r
who as yet, had not expressed a choice I
for Governor, and thinking, perhaps, C
our headers would like to see some i
decided expression of opinion from t
us on this sulbject, we propose this f
week to lay ourselves open, and ex
press our convictions. As a general t
thing it is bad policy for a paper to a
attempt to control or make public t
opinion, the "dear public" are jealous t
of their tights, and any ineroaeh- a
ments thereon, from any quarter, will vi
be viewed with suspicion and distrust, a
newspapers, therefore, should lie L
guarded in their desires to forestall 0
in tile least particle, the great public t
inas and incli:ation, but rather con- t
tent themselves with the humbler du- 0
ty of reporting and reflecting the t
public sentiments of the day. But, 0
notwithstanding the great danger we "
will run of displeasing our readers, t
we do not think it possible for ius t
longer to keep silent, when from all II
parts of tihe State the papers are in- ii
dulging in this sport of Governor
making, and we think it rather hard
that we should not be allowed to give
expression to our pent-up, and hither- r
to suppressed emotions. Because we t
are conducting a newspaper and work- t
ilg in the interest of the Democrat- c
Conservative party, and thlrough that t
party in the interest of the people, it is i1
n1o reason why we should be con- i1
sidered more than human, without a
any human weakness or human sym- f
pathies. We have postponed this T,
pleasure as long as it is possible for t
us to do it, and come what may, we ii
are going to say who is our chloice for o
the next Governor of the State of a
Louisiana. He is a man thoroughly t
identified with the people in every t
particular. He does not live in some c
Northen or Western State, nor is he a
known to the Customhouse clique; r
but lie has been long enough among a
us to acquire a knowledge of the o
wants of our people, and when elect- p
ed, will see that these wants are at- tb
tended to. As to his previous politi- p
cal associations we know nothing, nor I
care to know, we are well satisfied v
with him as we find him, or as we o
will find him, we care not if he was an rI
old line Whig, or Jeffersonian Demo
crat, Fusionist, Compromiser, or anti- I
Compromiser. But there is-one thing p
we do care to know, and that is this: tl
Is he honest? one more, is lie capa- a
ble ? with these two qualifications li
we rest satisfied, and perfectly wil- g
ling to take our chances. He has N
never in his life speculated in Bonds fi
of the State, or other fraudulent se- ti
curities; hie has never been connect- .
ed with any.rings ti ti. st.ti, no ant
of it, nor his be ever been the tool of w
any man or set of men, nor is it pos- b
sible he ever will be. , o
His entire life has been sncl tlhat a
no man living would dare to approach 11
him with a dislhonest or disreputable y
proposition; and when hie is elected, tl
as he will be, ihe will be the Governor n
of the State of Louisiana, and not of
a party. He will not be under the t
control of any set of particular men, a
simply from the fact tlat they sup- d
ported him, but all alike, high and 0
low, white or black, rich or poor, can a
come before him, plead their cause, q
not as Democrate, not as Republicans, re
not as Compromisers or anti-Compro. a
misers, but simply as eitizens of Lou- h
isiana. If any man Ihas a real or im.- t
agined wrong to lay before him, he 5
will not ask lhm how lie voted or how I
he intends to vote for the next Presi. d
dent, befose his ecase is taken under a
consideration, no such degrading a
questions,will be made to the appli- g
cant, but the only question will be, o
how can ";l serve you, as Governor of P
this great commonwealth, withoutt
doing a wrong to some one else. If '
you can uake out a ease that requires
my attention, yeou shall have it as far r
as the law permits me to go. I know I
not if yon are publican or sinner, nor b
do I care to know, but this I know, c
and the path is plain before me, I am
Governor of the State of Louisinna, t
a position the constitution and the e
lhaws irve ceated, and the peoplbe
have elected me to fill it according t6
thie lawIv;bt in theselaws I hleibothi '
ing for Demoerats, I see nothing for
Republicans, but I see laws for all the
ceitizens, good or bad. If you area
good citizen and come to me-with a
real grievance, so far as tlheJaw will
bear me o~t, I will aid you to tihe ex
tent of my ability., No man in this
commonwealth shall be oppressed be
cause of his race, polities, or religion,
so long as I hold my seat .on this
chair. We have:, had enough of this,
and my people ahall hear no more of
it. I am determined to rebuild her
fallen fortupnes, and restore to her Cit
izens their rigts under the constitu
tiou-to which they are justly entitled. a
Oar citiens hadl: had enough of thesae a
partiki (lovernor's, looklmtg dnly to I
the inteteat of, parrty, and not to the I
people, now i becomes my duty to 4
pot a stop to this, and no man hliall (
darkeno mnyjooi *tr tihehtopeof re
wardfrom partypulderation thrbough
any euconbaragemnnt from me. Thus
will ape. the ani who -id or cLliolee
for Governor afteri hi e1hcd4lo , * t
and the noble men who will gather
there will have no other, his nomina
tion is already certain, and his elec
tion almost secured. This is our
choice, and we hope our readers will
excuse us in thus presenting to them'
our choice, or in any manner attempt
ing to warp their opinions or forestall
their preconceived ideas of personal
favorites.
We know the men who will meet
together at Baton Rouge, and we can
see with a prophetic eye what course
they will carve out, and what men
they will bring to the front as stand
ard beaters is this, the great Centen
nial canmpaign. The Convention that
assembled in thie city of New Orleans
last January, was the prototype ot the
one to assemble in Baton Rouge on
the 24th July next, and as the dis
tinguished chairman remarked on that
occasion, "This is the beginmnig of
the work that is to be the death-knell
of Radical rule in this State." So
we may say of the work of the Ba
ton Rouge Convention, It will make
the winding sheets, and the ballot
box will bury it out of sight forever,
in November next.
Pacific Railroad.
The Directors of the Pacific Rail
road Company, on last Sunday, asked
the citizens of New Orleans, the Cot
ton Exchange, the Merchants Ex
change, the Chamber of Commerce,
the Ciearing House, the Board of Un
derwriters, the Association of Steve
dores, that of tihe Commissioners, in
a word, all the organizations having
for end the commercial and industrial
progress of the City of New Orleans,
to appoint delegates to visit thie Road,
inspect the works, examine tile books
of the Company, and make a minute I
and impartial report upon every
thing. The3 (the Directors) declare
that they are ready to cede their pla
ces to other administrators if the ex
amination is not perfectly satisfacto
ry to them and the public; we can but
approve this solemn demand. It is
of a nature to.give confidence to the t
people in this eminently useful en
terprise. We believe that the com
pletion of this line of Railroad would (
bring to the City of New Orleans tlie I
value of 700,000 bales of cotton, that
other lines have perverted from us, t
regain a trade of 30,000,000.
We, translate the above from the
Propaoateur Catholiqaue, a religious
paper, published in New Orleans, in
the interest generally of the people,
and particularly of the Catholic re
ligion. We think the estimate of the
great benefits to accrue to tihe city of
New Orleans, is vastly understated,
for those who make these calcula
tions must remember that this Road
will traverse a country almost in a
wealth as little understood as it has
been improved. There is no eonntry
on tjie habitable globe more fertile I
and productive than this Valley of 1
Red River. There are no lands that
yield more gratefnlly and bountifully
than these hitherto undeveloped
mines of incalenlable wealth.
They are capable of producing all
the wants man could ask of them,
and that too in the greatest nbnn
dance. Here is .thie natural habitat
of sugar, cotton, rice, tobacco, corn,
and in fact every thing to satisfy in
quick return, the demands that the
requirements of man could possibly
ask. Cattle live through the winter
here without the least attention from
their owners, and homrses roam the
swamps untamed by the trainers
hand. Sheep are prolific, prosper and
do well with scarcely any care, when
spared by the wolfish dogs. Fruits of
all kinds and varieties, grow to the
greatest perfection, and the province
of Guienne, in France, could not mar
pass its wine growing capacity, if
touched and tilled by the experienced
vintager.
If the Railroad will immediately
restore to the city of New Orleans
$0S,000,000 in trade, this can easily
be multiplied by ten in the next de
cade, and we think, the estimnate
would be too low. Sett!le up this Coun
try with active and iodustrious farm
ers, and we think it would excel any
other country in thie world.
And now, speakiig for onr climate,
we can say in $ruth, that it is healthy.
and salubrious ; our seasonsare mild
and eveh, "Nature has beelrkind to
us'in all ways; and all tjmat reinins
now to be done, trhat, our land may
prosper, is, that Capital and Labor
rmay be induceed to .come among as.
The first will findl a rich l6d to ru.
ward it, and the latter will be hearti
ly welcomed,.

important that y ward in tie par- sti

Our Rights.
We believe it to be the duty of
Journalist to maintain the rights of
the people in all cases of public mat
ters, although in a great many in
stances they may apparently seem to
meddle with affairs not exactly ap
pertaining to their duties. But, if
our people are deprived of any of
their rights, we feel at liberty to en
quire into the matter, and if we can *
thereby secure to them what they
have been deprived of, we think we
should receive our meed of praise.
Many months gone, we were so
unfortunate as to loose our highly re
spected and much loved Bishop of
this diocese, the Right Rev. Bishop 1
Martin, since which time the vacant
Bishopric has been conducted and
man.aged, no doubt, as well as it
could have been, but notwithstand
ing, we are entitled to a Bishop, and
from this fact if front no other, we
want one. As free American citizens
we have the unquestioned privilege
to make this demand, and hof'e our
request will be attended to by the
Ecclesiastical authorities established
for such purposes.
Letter from the Country.
Mr. Editor :
Out in our section the people gen
erally are busy with crops and have
not the time at this early day, nor
the disposition to engage in political
work. Seeing before us ample time
to accomplish all we may hope for,
we are loath to engage in the excite
ment incident to a protracted and
heated canvass. After our work is
under way, our crops well it hand,
then we will be ready for the great
undestaking, of routing the Radicals
out of their strong hold, and you may
depend when we begin this business
we are going at it with earnestness
and determination. We have en
dured their abominable villany as
long as we are willing to bear it, and
if there is any virtue left in our peo
ple (nnd I think there is) we will put
an end to their schemes of plunder,
the coming election, which will last
to the benefit of coming generations.
We are too poor and dependent to
neglect the important matter of se
curing crops for other things that
may be postponed to a more season
able time. Do not imagine my dear
sir, fora moment, that we out here
in the country are indifferent or uin
mindful of the grave responsibility
resting upon us. or that we will be
found wanting in any respect when
called upon to do our duty. No ! far
from it. Among my people there is
a deep underlying current of bitter
hostility to the Radical ring in this
parish, and we have declared, in our
hearts of hearts, that the next elec
tion will see us forever free of
them, or we want to see no sun dawn
for the morrow. We have appointed
delegates to the Convention to take
place in your town on the 8th inst..
(next Mondlay) and hope they, in coln
nection with yours and the balance of
the pat ish, may inangurate the begin
ing of the eampaign in such a way

adventure. After a few months you
can call on its f,,r any amount of work
and I can pledge nmy people will res

ers of his party and his distressed
conotry.

WlITE LAND.
SIt will be seen by a dispatch from 1
-Coushatta, to J. H. Cosgrove, Esq.,
at this place, that King, Tax Collee
Stor of Red River parish was killed,
and W. H. Twitchel seriously wound
ed, on the 2d inst., by some one un
Sknown, while crossing the river in a
a skiff. The party doing the shooting
made his escape, though pursued by
the Sheriff's posse, and up to lateslt
accounts had not been arrested. We
do not know the cause of the attack
, on these parties, but the provocation
I must have been serious, and deeply
'felt by the'one who did the shooting.
I Twitehel has carried things in Red
River parish to an unwarranted ex
Stent, and excited, no doubt, againstt
bhim feelings of suech bitter hatred,
that nothing but the forfeit of his life
f will satisfy the parties whom lie has
Sso deeply wronged. Men have been
driven from thbdir bhomes and firesides,
- aIBhonndedl down at the instigation
Sof this man, and they are not apt to
foriget sich treatmenta, and sooner or
B later, :!!e might reasonably have exr
Spected the calamity that has befallen
him.

Investigation. t
The Minden Democrat some time s
since (April 15th) copied a report,
published in the New Orleans Times
of an interview by a gentleman sign
ing himself Liberal Republican with i
the various parties who have been (
mentioned as likely candidates for
Governor in which the following par
agraph occurs : t
This Liberal gentleman, whose
name is not given, is of the opinion,
so far as the city of New Orleans is
R concerned, that
HoN. L. A. WILTZ
Will be a very strong man; that the
IUwi-. portion o'tie' ity* ie nnnnin'llsnntn
fir himi. He does not thimlk, however,
that either WYiitz or McEuery will be
nominated.
Wilts is the youngest man in the
field for Governor. Hlis administra
tion of the city government, while
Mayor of New Orleans, was the most
,ble and eeonotnical that that city
has enjoyed since the war. His ree
ord, both in pnublie and in private life,
Sis without a blemish. A native of
tthe State, young, enterprising, joined
with unquestioned ability, he will,
in our humble opinion, prove a strong
? candidate, and if nominated will be
more enthusiastically supported
Sthroughout the State than any man
SNew Orleans could select.

I entered the Attorney General's of
' fice last night by pressing open the
0 window on the St. Louis street side.
'r It is evident, from thie manner in
which the midnight prowlers went to
work, that they were not after world
ly gains, but valuable papers. The
manner in which they left the room
showed that there must have been
four men at work, as there were tour
chairs in a semi-cir,cle, and in front of
each chair was a bundle of the Attor
ney General's papets, which had ev
idently been considered worthless by
thie thieves. Every desk in the room
had been prized open with a jimmy,
and their contents thlrownt promis
eonsly about. Splotches of candle
grease can be found on the gallery
and Bfloor, showing the entrance and
exit of the marauders. Attorney Gen
Seral Field being interviewed by oar
Sreporter on thie subject, stated that
tins was the fifth time that men had
entered isi office for the purpose ot
stealing valuable papers; that two
days before Clintoi's trial took place 1
Shis office was burglarirzed for the par
pose of stealing valuable papers,
which, it was supposed, he had in his
possession; and that he was couvin It
ed.that this last burglary was tlhe
work of Kellogg, his pimps, and his
. police, as the belief is that he (the
SAttorney General) lbad been in secret
eorrespondence witl certain nameless
powers, either for their ruin or hisi 1
gain, and Kellogg was so afraid that 1
g some damning evidence might reveal I
Sitself from these papers, that he was 1
determined to destroy them, even if I
his birelings had to commit a bargla

Why the lRepubhcan Party

(From the New York Sun.)
It seems almost impossille to ind
a sound spot in Grant's Administra
tion. In every department and
brancli of the public service rottenaea
is found whenever the searcbing
probe of investigation is applied ; and
yet the discoveries thus far made ae
in great measure due to accident aad
to the reckless habits of officials, who,
fromnt long immunity and concionsose
of power, exposed themselves to de
tection.
The late Secretary of War impeachr
ed; the Secretary of the Navy is like.
lh to experience the same infliction
the Interior Department is honey..
combed with joblery in the Indisa
Bureau, Land Office, the Pension Of.
fice, and the Patent Oflice ; the Post
Office Department is stuffed with
straw bids and collusive contracts/
the Treasury under Boutwell and
Richardson was a mass of false ea.
tries, forced balances, overissnes, and
deceptive bookkeeping ; the Depart.
nmet of Justice has beeu a political
machine for persecuting opponents of
Grantism, swindling tihe Treasury,
and enriching itle worst class of
scoundrels that` ever disgraced the
American name ;and the State De.
partment has been used to betray
American policy and to furnish enor.

It was quite.natural with a Pres.
ideut who worships the golden calf,
and with a Cabinet made up of sub.
servient clerks, who were glad to r.
inter his edicts, that Rings shoa
have been organized to control tli
political power of the Administra.
tion. The Baeodks, Shepherds, Kil
bourns, McDonalds, Joyees and that
crew, formned the kitchen Cabinet,.
surrounded Grant socially and almost.
captured the Government. They had*
access to all the secrets, suppressed'
what they pleased and crushed oat`
opposition. In Congress the voice .of
the minority was stifled by Blaine,
who as Speaker was a despot. He'
had two motives to guide lim, fiat"
his own success, and secondly tile saW
ess of the party. Though the' tiio
were combined, lie made the seciN
always subservient to the first. Tit
Senate was governed by a few lead
era, whose rule of action was to tihes
a clean bill of health to every infct.
ed partisan like Pomeroy and to
whitewash every subject of investip .
tion like the sale of arms to Frame,
or the Leet and Stocking monopoly.
Thus the Government has been me
as a close corporation, in the exclasia
interest of oieceholders, Rings, eel
tractors, and rascals. The gramtr
the thief the more recognized his p.
a sition. Grant set the example of be
ing a guest of Boss Shepherd, ad
drove through the streets of the ea
ital with McDonald by his side, wIa
is now philosophizing over homas
vanities in the cell of a penitentiar.
Grant knew him to be a thief, for I is
friend Ford had told him so; hlt
that fact made no difference. As
McDonald satid, the goose hung al.
titudlem.
The chiefs who were highest li
favor with Grant and his Senate at
s Washington planned the conspia
by which the Freedman's Bank we
plundered of nearly all its depelori
and thie poor negro were cheated ~at
