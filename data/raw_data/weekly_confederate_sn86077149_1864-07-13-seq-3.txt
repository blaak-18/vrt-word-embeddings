This was s iid of gold a few dnys ago; but

not believe the yankee accounts of federal vic
tories. Gold sees Grant, as be is crippled by
hard fighting and heavy 1 ss, demoralized by
disaffection ami weakened by succ'S.-ive -disasters
; aial it sees moreover the cool andcalui

and staring, and limbless, mutilated, wounded,
liiitking in agony, and perishing amid fl imes
consumed to cinders, with no arm to save
them. All this, gold sees and hears, when
one -of tuote' tnousti-r assau'.t, are made ; and
when the yaukee pr,jss claim out of all this
to have won a decisive viol rv ; and Grant
slides thereon to uew b-ise go'.d knows H is
a cha.t, a lie, and never will believe a word
of it but goes on rising, setting the whole
north in C'-mmntion a-ud confusion, and hast

To the Public.
Recent allusions-to my name and-conduct.
in some of the news-papers of the city, have
rendered it nectssary that I should come be
fore the public with a statement of iacts
A ioonth.ort.wosii.ee Iappud to a num
ber of our citize; s tor subscriptions to pur
chase a church edifice in Raleigh, for my con
gregation to Worship in. The report has gone
tint that this edifice was intended as a meet
ing place for a secret p- litiqal a-soriation to
be t'sed for divine worship. Among many
othevs Mr. Tloiden subs ribed to purcha.-e the
building, a;. J it has bei u reported th;t he was
thus aiding said political association. ' I
solemnly declare that, this report is utterly
untrue. The money w as r-dsed for the sole
purpose of purchasii the house tor divine
worship, and it has been used for no tidier.
It has also been reported that 1 sought the
cbaplaiT.cy of irajof the hospitals in Raleigh,
with a view of being enahUd to disseminate
certain podiicil Merriments among the sol
diers ; and that Mr. Holden, -who wrote my
application for the pi ice, was a party to this
effort and purpose. I tlesired to obtain the
place, hoping to be of service to the s uis and
bodies of our sick and w.nr de-1 soldiers, and
at the same time a-si.st H supporting my
family. Mr. II- loen has drawn up papers
for me before th w:r, ai d he 'r- w up this
application at my request. Nothing was
said to hin by me, or he to me, ;f a pohtval
nature, in eoenecti ai tvith ihe tpplieafion. He
said be won id nut sign it, for his name would
do me no good. r
The. facts concerning my connection with a
f-ecret political organization said to be in ex
istence in this State are simply these. A
friend informed me that, he could put me in
possession i certain information that would
be of use to rne ai.d my family, in the event
of the enemy overrunning this section of the
country ; and this information was communt

not without ttie better and kindHer leatine's
of a go k! man ; ay-t while s . ne tiny be s
steeped in audacity as ro defy the public, we
think Mr. Everett would rev;g ize th - foe.
of a just public censure. This h- meri s ; ard
the only evidence he can gi .eot repentance,
is to yield to it.
At the same 4ime, h has unq'iHstionably
committed a crime perh ips ntre than one
for he is a practising at'orfi-y, S-etciior for
the county, snd it is presume! his taken the
oath of allegiance ; and the Law ought to be

.What we have said of Mr. -Everitt is app:i
cable also to Mr. Holden. The law ought to
be tested in his case. If a m m can receive
such letters in time of war, and conceal
them ; if he can encourage desertion, aid the
enemy, accuse the Govennent. advi-e its over

Wayne C untv j
I certify that on or a 00 at th- i2o day of
December last, I met Mr Nee.iham Smith at
the corner near Nathan Aoum's rei ieu -e.
He aske;i me il was g -iiig t the P.t Of
nee, ani it 1 c 'ui t en inge a tr ie 1 re
plied iu the affirm u ve. He t'uen gave me a
letter addressed t W .W. Ho'den and a $5
note, and 1 gave him $1 l-r.r.ye.e.rid re asked
me to put the $1 in the letter a- d mail ir (or
him. which I pi'-uiised to do. He remarked
at the time that there was a secret in the let
ter and I must not read it. When I opened
he letter to put the money in. ntf . attention
was attracted by the heavily underscored pcr
tion of the letter, (bung site whole t f the last
paragraph) anil by the signature, a'nd I then
tead it and it was of such a di.-!ov! an 1 trea
sonable nature that I determined I would not
mail it till 1 had sb'iwn h t some frauds who
dviseime to show it to G. V. Strong, E-q..
District Attorney. I was ad? Ned by Mr.
Strong to take a cofy of the letter and send
the original oo to Mr! H lden, -which I did.
Mr. Strong and myself cm pa red tbe copy
and original letter, and the letter as published
iu the Con federate of the 13ih Jti'e..l8o4 is an
exact copy of the original h tter from "-My Dear
Holden" down to "Joints II .... Everett.". I
i.ave been well acquainted with James II
Everett's band writing for about fi ft eeai year-,
having seen his writing ami seen him w.ite
hundreds, ofTimes, and there i- no sh-?d vV of
doubt on ray mind that the letter was writ
ten entirely by him. I did not make the let
ter mucn of a secret, a I showed the copv
moothi, ago to John Everett and odier promi
nent men of this couuty, to let them see what
was going on in our midst.
