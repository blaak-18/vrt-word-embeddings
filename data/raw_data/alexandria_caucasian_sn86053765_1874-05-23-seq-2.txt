THE CONFLICT
ict|of Ki
ACES.
The only objection that we hare
heard urged against the movement
to organize a white man's party for
the next campaign, is that it is an
effort to array" the white race
against the black. This is not the
fact, and if the whites do organize
a party upon that issue, they will
uot bo responsible for the arraying
of the two races in political couflict
The responsibility will rest upon
the negro, alias Republican party
who, since 1808 have held the
balance of political power in this
State, upon that issiie alone The
strength ofthat party consists in
the fact that it is the negro party,
the representative of their peculiar
ideas, the ext onent of their views
upon matters of legislation, and the
sworn champion of their rights in
contra-distiuction to the rights of
the white men. The few white men
Ö * •
who belong to that party, have sig
nified their complete transmigration
by accepting social as "well as polit
ical equality; by becoming in tact,
negroes in all but the complexion
of their skin. So jealously has the
negro guarded this point that noth
ing less would satisfy him, in no
single particular would he relax
the vigor of his insolent demands.
Tho marriage of negro conctibines,
with the strictest formalities of the
law, ami the open and avowed ac
knowledgment of the paternity of
negro offsprings, were sweet smell
ing sacrifices that they have persis
tently demanded should bo made by
their white allies upon tlnfaltar of
race.
The closest bonds of union among
themselves and complete and entire
abnegation of every tie that bound
a white man to his race, have beeiP
the controlling ideas with the negro
in his social and political relations
with the whites. Legislation lias
been directed to the securing of the
supremacy of the negro, °and the
law has been made to botf and
kneel to this great mogul of their
idolatry. Courts have been crea
ted and lauded as they have sacri
ficed every principle of law, ami
trampled" upon <^very vestige <if
riglit'iu asscriing the supremacy of
the negro ; and justice has been
made to tear the 0 bandage from her
eyes and bidden to see only the ne
gro; ordered to weigh him and
his rights alone in her scales. He
has sat in the halls of our legisla
o o
ture and with an insolence that no
Russian Czy riding roughly over
the prostrate and shrieking forty of
a bleeding Poland, ever dared as
sume, and with the grinning con
sciousness ojj a power to oppress
that never eu'terwd into the wildest
dream of the Turk, he has bffiden
us educate his kinky headed chil
dren and we have kept ours at home
and paid the money for their e<fii
cation ; commanded us to pay out
rageous taxation to support him
and his party friends in fat offices
with Oxhorbitant salaries, and we
have toiled and groaned and seen
onr own families suffer for the
common necessaries, that we might
run with the sweat of honest toil
pouring from our faces, to hand onr
contributions to his ease and luxu
ry over'to his fax collector, before
he could have trino to put up and
sell our property.
He has made our halls of législa
tions den of thieves, our courts a
mockery dipon justice, and the Ex
ecutive department of our Govern
inent a synonimo for-rascality, a
reproach and a bye-word among
the honest men of the world. Huge
monopolies, under his rule, have
reared their hydra heads all around
us, and we have been made to pay
tribute to 0 tlvem, without mercy and
without ceasing! Chaos and eon
fusion have held a high carnival in
our public places ; crime has been
encouraged, mUrder, rape and ar
son, have exhibited their hideous
forms in the broad light of day ; and
desolation have marked
own, in obedience to
his behests.
These monstrous things have not
come to pass of their own accord,
but are the legitimate results of ?he
negro domination over the white
people of this State, aud they are
all a part and parcel of his pre
arranged plan of persecuting the
ruin and
us for their
whites to the verge of desperation
nnd robbing them to the full extent
of their means. Thus and thns on
ly could the n^gro fill the measure
.
of his brntal hate of his formet' mas
ters, and only by witnessing this
political degradation and pecunia
ry bankruptcy of the white could
he show his superiority. Hating
his superior intelligence and enoy
ing his possession of greater wealthy
the negro instead of attempting to
elevate himself, concluded tlmt it
was easiqr to drag the white mau
down to his own level. Aud now
when wo, having grown weary of
tame submission to this mos& deso
lating war of the "nrgro npon us,
propose to take a bold stand, to as -
sert the dignity of our manhood, to
say in tones of thunder and with
tho voice of the angry elements.
STOP! THUS FAR SHALT
TIIOU GO, AND NO FURTHER !
We are met with the babyish
wail and old niaidish horrified whine
of, " Oh ! rieasc don't ! You will
array the tico races in • qpnflift"
Who lias arrayed them iu conHiCt. 1
Who has been preaching a -crusade
of race for seven years? And o
what we do care if it does become
necessary to array them in conljict Î
The conflict is only a political oiy,
and if he wants to change its char
acter or to provoke us to the point
of exchanging ballots for more forc
ible weapons, who fears the .result
or has any misgivings? • We would
deeply deplore any such issue of
our efforts to save our State from
irrevocable political damnation,
and we would counsel a. resort to
violence only when it was forced on
us as it was at Colfax, but we are
not to be aeterred from a bold and
outspoken advocacy of our ideas
because such a conflict miff ht take
place. ê

The Printing Law.
We publish In Another plum S letter of
Mr. T, O, Tracy, Manager of the Ifew Or
leans Republican, to some gentl&nan in
ghreveport, clipped by IIS from the Shreve
ivertiseuient l»v the Jinit 1, anrl dividing
"
port Times, in relation to the trtie inter
pretation of that infamous bill known «s
the Printing Law. Mr. Tracy's interpre
tation is tho. law and tho pospél to such
petty understrappers as the Rapides Ga
zette here and we have something to say
about the charges and practices of that in
dependent T bold ? aud honest? journal
Tho law itself is a bungling one, as most
of the acts of the negro legislature are and
says that Hie radical papers tlioughont the
State who do the public printing s I ih M Im
paid ".one dollar a square for each inser
tion" and that '"a square shall consist of
the spaco of ten lines aoa*k " type. Mr.
Tracy has just decided that these last quo
ted wonts mean that tho typo used shall
bo agate, thai? it shall lie set solid, without
any display lines unless specially request
ed, and that if the official journal" has not
got the agate type, that in sotting adver
tisements in other typ» allowance shall
be*inade for the difference.
, The Gazette not satisfied with a monop
oly at a more than fair remuneration, puts
its interpretation upon tho words "space
of ten Jines soljd agate" aud as it put
money iif the pocket of its Editor and his
pegro master, comes to the conclusion that
he can set the judicial advertisements in
any sort of type he chooses, and then take
the Republican, measure, the spaco of ten
lines solid agato, in which it sets its ad
vertisements, and charge, for as many
squares as tha measure shown the space
occupied by his larger type. It uses brevier
for its advertisements, the same type
which it uses for its edi tori als. Brevier is
three sizes larger than agato, minion and
non panel coming between them, accord
ing to Brnee's Specimen Book, and the
difference can not be less than three lines
in ten. Iii other words the Gazette, accord
ing to Mr. Tracy, ought to allow twelve or
thirteen lines for ten. Instead of doing so
it charges for the space of ten lines solid
agate, set in brevier, display lines and all.
We have measured thç spaco of ten lines
soliij agato in tho Republican and then
compared it with the measure of the Ga
zette in the advertisement in its last, is
sue of Virgin»» Troncliin vs. E. R Brossât,
where it has got solid lavier, commenc
ing with the décret^ part of the judgment
and we wo flml that, the measure covers
exactly seven lines. This make« a differ
ence of three lines in favor of the adver
tizer which added to the tlffee linen that
ought to have hoerf allowed for difference
of type, according to tho Republican,
makes a difference of six lines iii favor of
the advertiser for every square charged in
that advertisement. Tho printers foe
charged for advertising that judgment
three times is $15 00. Measuring it with
our ten ilne agate mearnre as the Gazette
(ioes, wo find that it makes five squares.
Tho charge, if it was set in solid agate or
tlie proper allowance for difference for ilif«j
feront type made, shonld be not, over $9 00
allowircg for display lines and all. To put
the matter in its simplest form: for every
thirteen lines that tho Gazette charges atul
receives pay, the advertiser is entitled to a
credit©r>f six lines. Representing thé art'
into thirteen-parts—tho Gazelle is en
titled to sevon-thtrtor*nths and the adver
tiser six-thirteenths or one-thirteenth less
than one half in every one of its advertise
ments. This in a journal professing to be.
so scrupulously honest, hq enterprising, so
critical and so awfully anxious to get hon
est and intelligent men in office, locQs like
extortion, has the odor of disi.onesty and
smacks considerably of corruption in one
of the liigb places of radicalism. Such
petty larcenies warrant the belief in this
particular case, that "the press" had been

malicionn flings at na—ihe negro organ
here tmder the above oaptlon, in its leader
or last week, aeeka to faaten .«pan utfe de
reliction of duty in not noticing the-caso
of Dozier charged with rape We appre
hend that that malicious, slandorona and
social oqnality loving exponent of negro
ideas and pretended champion of negro
rights, had three objects in view in devot
ing its leading column to the disgnsting
details of a crime not fit to lie mentioned
to oars pohfe. First—to claim for itself
mere of boldness and journalistic enter
prise than the Caucasian lia». Second—to
inflame the Q negro passions by a forced
comparison of two really entirely dNfor
ent cases. And thirdly—to make a point
aga nst ns to gratify its malice and cover
its chagrin at onr former storings of its
immaculate "I) editor. As toits first oh.
ject it most, signally fails, tor the crime is
alleged t» liavo been committed on the
!Wd of April and it is rather late on the 16th
of May to claim anything in-the way of
enterprise and boldness, On the 25th of
April, when it could have made some claim
to both, it came out with the following
very mild notice :
A R kkious C iiakok .—On Thnrsday last
a well-know citizen of Pineville, our over
the river neighbor, was arrested and
brought before Judge Orslmrn, charged
with a revolting outrage upon a respecta
ble young girl, of thirteen or fourteen
years of age. The child not beingable tb
appear Hie examination of the case was
postponed until to-day.
As to its second object; it may or may
not have snceeded in pandering to the
negro hate of the whites, but the différen
ces between the two cases are marked.
The Grant parish outrage was committed
by a negro upon a young lady of high so
cial position. assisted by a mob of negroes
and in the very presence of the mother of
the yonng lady, who had no male relations
present to protect her or av/mgo her
wrongs. There was no denial, but a con
fession of the crimo.
Iii the Dozier case both were white, rep
aration by marriage is possible, a denial
was emphatically made and the defengo—
as wo learn from his counsel, would have
been consent, and tho girl had able bodied
male relations present to take the matter
in hand aud meet out to the culprit such
justice as they mi^ht have thought, tho
case demanded. The girl herself told two
different stories about it, and when her
own father made an affidavit against, Do
zier and put the matter in the hands of
the officers W the law, the people of Pine
ville concluded, and wo agreed with theue
that it, was no business of theirs to inter
fere with the law in its course. Had they
done so, this very same virtnons (?) and
indignant (?) Gaz tie would have boon
the first to cry against mob hiw.
Wo were waiting for the developoments
of the preliminary examination, and after
he had gone off and failed to appear for
his trial, giving ns the first conclusive ev
idence we had'of his guilt, we eonld have
had nothing to say about it except to lay
the whole blame where it belongs, lipon
the shoulders of the radical District Judge
who had violated the plainest letter of the
law in bailing a prisoner sharged with a
cstpital offense, This very same Gazette
helped to elect hiin, and ho is one of the
shining lights of the same radical negro
partPhere that, claims tho Editor of the
'cCazetle as-one of ,ts most, influential mem
o
Wers. It is "too thin" to try to make a
scape g»at of our honest people and of us,
Mr Gazette man an^J you can't palm off
any such stuff. The District Judge, John
Orsborn. and the Gazette, presided over by
that pure and virtuous <1) editor with
"twenty years experience, off and on,"
who helped put him on the bench
and is now supporting him there,
are to blame that Doziej* was not punished,
if he deserved it, ami that "hPwas permit
ted to ride aw°ay unmolested." "All these
fae© and others very °damaging to"the
man's past reputation" were not "well
kno\%n in the community in which he
lived,^and were not believed nntil after
Dozier had given license for the belief by
leaving.during the night, as was after
wards ascertained. 0 °
To make out its point against ns the
Gazette fir«t finds it necessary to presume
that wo "arrogate to oursofves, by impli
cation at least, the proud destiuction of
being the censor of public morals, the
fountain of intelligence, the disseminator
of the latest news 0 .yid in short a a live wide
awake newspaper ," etc. With the single
exception of the last clause which he ital
icizcd, there is no word of truth in the
whole quotation, and the whole premise
of the Gazette is an unwarranted fabrica
tion. This modo of fabricating premises
and then arguing from them is a favorite
resort with t.lffls would I ks logical and pre
tended consistent journal, anil indeed, of
nearly all of the papers who profess the
same political negro creed that ^t does.
Companionship with negroes upon terms
of social, political and intellectual equali
t}-, seems to be infectious. Wo exclaim
with Sir John Kallstaff, slightly changed,
"how the Gazette is given to lying'."
We would not have noticed his petty
flings at us at this length, but, that our
friend and ally The Democrat took 9ip the
cudgel behalf of the community and of
ourselves, and as he deemed the slanders
of the malicious and negro loving journal
worthy of notice, We follow suit. Öur par
ting notice to the rotten old shebang is
that we own the Cawasian not by the
grace ot a negro, as heodoes the Gazette,
nor as he owned the last paper he had, by
any process of bjotting out the distinction
between menm and tuum as he did in dis
posing of what never belonged to him—
^'ut by virtue of honest purchase nnd that
we intend^ put in it what we please and
leave out of it what we clg>oso and that no

Is it trno tlint tho people of this
State, Parish nnd Town are so btir
tlicned witli taxes that their property
is practicnlly confiscated? This is what
we have been saying for some time. Is
it a f.ict, or only a sort of electionering
catch-phrase we have invented to
make the Radicals odiousT If it in
true, how is it that the Town Council
are about to impose an ndditionnl bur
den on property already loaded to its
utmost capacity and without tho ex
cuse of necessity. To whom are this
impoverished community indebted for
the suggestion, which has taken the
foim of a Town Ordinance, that a Tax
shall be„ laid now to squeeze from our
pockets the few nickels that are need
ed to buy bread and meat for the sum
mer 1 Was ever town property so
little able to bear more taxes f How
many stores are shut up—how many
dwellings unrented 7 Did their owners
ever have so little money Î Yet this
is the time selected bv the Council to
lay more taxes. Perhaps somo one
will say, it has been ever so mnny
years since the town ' was taxed. Is
that a good reason why you shonld
commence when vge are at our lowest
depression. If onr people mean what
they say when they compluin of taxes,
don't let the Town Council give the

sort of burthens that we curse the
