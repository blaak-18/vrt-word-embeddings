I. ON THE WING.
S NEw ORLEANS, Aug. 14, 1880.
Dear Vindicator-I arrived last
Tuesday evening at ri o'clock, at
Grand Ecore, and as there was no
oast lr sight, I had ample time to
Sview the surroundings. The first
place I Inspected was the store of our
Mriend, H. Manhelm. I found there
a large and extensive stock of every.
Sthbing In the grocery and provision
line, and Mr. Manhelm assured me
that he has made such arraogemente
o as will enable him to furniro supplies
o as low as they can he ordered in
small quantities from New Orleans
e or St. Louis.
After spending an hour on the
wharf, In company with our friends
Manhelm, Valery Murphy, Messl,
French, and many others, the boat
whistle was heard in the distance,
! and at 6 o'clock the Danube reached
the landing. In company with J.
H. Hill, Tommy Beale, Mr. Oregory
and hl brother, and Nathan Myer,
I went aboard. On being introduced
to Capt. Hamilton and Clerk McChes
ney, I was most cordially welcomed
as a representativeof the VINsDsTon.
Indeed, all we met on the river were
warm toin their praise of the course or
the VIaDIOATOR. On board I was in
troducoed to the mother and brother
of our distingubhed young artist,
James C. Noise.
Int the cabin of the Danube Is a
sweet.toned Faivre piano, whieh die
coursed sweet music at the touch of
skillful and artistlo fngers. The ar
tist, in his modesty, requests we
r mention not hie name.
rAt the Tramway landing the boat
met an accident which delayed us
four hoars. The coupllng of the
rudder got bent, and owing tea con
Alot of jodgment between the arpen
ter, engineer and mate, the damage
was not repaired for near four hours.
At Plaeville, we took on a large
quantity of lumber and 57 head of
cattle for the New Orieans market.
The cattle were hard to manage and
some got Into the river. By the time
all were got aboard and the Alezan
drIa freight taken on, four hours
- uore were consumed. When we
r started again, Capt. Hamilton en.
deavored to make up for lost time.
SOn reachlng Echo, the news of the
disaster reached Capt. Hamilton,
who, as I wrote you. put on all the
steam the Danube could carry to
rqoh the scene. I sent the partieu
Jd :up by the Yazoo Valley, which
I fl'ope reaohed you In time for to
i day's lssue. There are a few other
Items whtoh I failed to record in the
hurry to get the letter off. A drench

even wanted pay for resouing a dead
body. They are said to have been
bent solely on plunder, with one
single soeption, whose name we re.
Sgretnot being able to record. The
Swreked were well cared for, how
ever, on the Danube.
From this time forward nothing oo
eurred to mar the pleasure of the
trip. The boat reahed her landlsg

The Tap and After.
In our consideration of the bene
Rt fits which are to come to our town
at through railroad connection, we must
o not lose eight of the fact, that It is
ýo the increase of the population we are
it to depend upon for an increase of bu
ir sines, and not to the mere fact of
r railroad connection with the outer
world. This railroad will bring peo
ple. they will come to buy lands,
1e open farms, mills, manufactorese;
to speculateand to merely see. With
a railroad, ten years hence, will see
our town with ten thousand inhabi
tarte, because the population of the
surroundilng country will he five or
e ten times as great as now, and a town
of that size can find employment for
its population from such a trade.
t We must not stop at the Tap. We
must have good roads to Red River;
d free ferries at St. Maurice, mouth of
Cane river, Grand Ecore, and over
Black Lake. That section reached
by these ferries will settle up with
d immigrants, coming by rail through
our town, and they will trade here.
d Natchitoches has yet a good future
if we will only exert ourselves.
Young men and old men, be up
and doing.

One of the firemen of the ill-fated
steamboat Bonnie Lee is authority
for the statement that the boiler of
a the vessel did not burst, and will be
a found intact when it is raised. He
i declares that the destruction of the
boat was occasioned by the explosion
I' of something in the hold.
e Capt. George Norton, suPervising
Inspector of steam vesels, bas had
his attention called to thedelaration
of the fireman, and will have proper
5 consideration given it by the Local
e Board of Inspectors when they open
-. their Investigation of the olroumtean
ees attendant on the aeeident.
' It is thought by many that the
* fireman is correct. The boiler stood
, several feet above the freight deck of
the boat, and it is dlmeult to under
stand how its bursting could have
'i wrecked the bull of the boat when

From the annual report 6f the

I followiug relating to l he
NEW OtLEANS PACIFIC RAILWAY.
By an arrangement with the par
ties who have uwdertaken the c',,i
struction of the New Orleans Pacific
road, stockholders of the Te'xa and
r Pacific Railway Company, and in the
" companies forming one of ltH c'n
necting lines, the Malesori, Ka,st s

rate of 0900 in cashe for a $1,n0, iU per
r cent gold bond, and $5.,0I par value
t of the capital stock of that company.
This New Orleans Pacific Railway
Company is organized under special
acts of the Louisiana Lagislat.urec
and its charter is perpetual. Tne
main line of road of the campany ex
tends from Shreveport via Alexand
ria--which is below the rapids oan
r Red River-to a crossing of the Mi -
I iessippi River near Baton Rouge, and
from thence to New Orleans, about
325 miles, and is the longest line of
road, projected or constructed, in
the State of Louisiana It passes
through the oldest and most thickly
settled and the finest agricultural
portion of the State, and has directly
tributary to it the rlich parishes of
Caddo, Deboto, Red River, Natchito.
ohes, Sabine, Rapidee, Avoyelles and
St. Landry, on Red River and the
Atchafalaya; and Pointe coupee,
I Iberville, Baton Rouge, Ascension,
S t. James and St. John Baptist, on
1 the Mississippi River.
a The line has been well located,
and as about 165 miles are already
I graded It can be completed at a very
I reasonable cost. The maximum
gradients are but 30 feet, and these
in favor of the heavy trade; it is
Ipractically a descending grade for
t its entire length to tide-water, and
Sas there is very little curvature It
I may be considered one of the most
I favorable located lines for economl
Cal working. There is but one truss
bridge on the line, croslasing the Ateh.
afalays River, which will secure
I cheap cost in operation and main
tenance.
From Shreveport to Cotile, a point
on Red River north of Alexandria, I
ia ne agricultural country, and along
this part of the line a bale of cotton
to the acre, and from 30O to 40 bushels
of corn., together with wheat oats,
r tobacco, hemp and live stock are
easily raised. From Ootile south the
line passes through what is known
as the Delta of Red River, the rich
est and most productive portion of
the State, extending for upwards of
200 miles along the valleys of the Red
and the Mississippi rivers. It is
through this section of country that
the enormous crops of sugar, cotton,
corn, &c., have been produced for
years without any impoverishment
of the soil. On many of the sugar
plantations 2,300 pounds of sugar
and three barrels of molasses per
acre have been readily made year
after year for many years, and from
a bale to a bale and a half of cotton
and good crops of corn and small
grains are grown in the same loca
ities. The country is well settled,
and it is believed that the local bua
siness alone will more than provide
for the fixed interest charge on the
construction bonds of the company,
that are limited to an issue of $20,010
per mile of road.
The distance from Shreveport to
Baton Rouge is about 230 miles, and
the completion of this road to that
point will make tributary to the Tex
as and Pacific lines the enormous
trafliO of the Misesisesippi, the Ohio
and Missouri rivers and their tribu
tary streams, At New Orleans the
largest vessels can discharge and re.
oeive freights alongside the railway
company's warehouses; and besides
the cotton, hides and wool from
northern and western Texes that will
naturally seek this outlet for foreign
ports it is believed that a very large
business will be done in the ship
ment of provisions, grain, &e., from
the countrv naturally tributary to
Kansas City, and that return freights
of sugar, coffee and oher imported
articlles intended for distribution
through northern and western Texas
the Indian Territory, Kansas and
western Missouri will be forwarded
via this line, as it will be the short
eat all-rail route worked in a com
mon interest, between navigable
waters and these different seotions
