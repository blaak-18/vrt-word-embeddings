sublime devotion to duty and ideals
displayed. I must acknowledge that
reading your burning editorials has
thrown a great deal of light on for
mer dark places; by its light, graft’s
slimy trail is seen across many erst
while spotless paths. Indeed, I find
myself in the position of old Agrippa,
“almost persuaded” to become a
“rad.” I enclose money order for
renewal to the monthly. I would like
so much to subscribe for the weekly,
but wouldn’t have the time to read it.
It 1 had it in my power, I would place
your magazine in every family under
the stars and stripes. With best
wishes for yourself and publications,
I am,
Very truly yours,
Virgil M. Rich.

Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Atlanta, Ga.,
Dear Sir: —The South and the
world are sadly in need of a history of
our country from the pen' of a South
ern man, and I know of no one better
fitted to perform that office than your
self. I believe a history from you
up to the end of the carpet-bag
regime, would redound both to your
honor and profit, and be bailed by a
grateful people who have been so
long denied their proper meed of
praise and justice at the hands of the
so-called historians of our country.
I place the limit at the end of the
reconstruction period, because I am
candidly afraid your prejudice would
bias your mind as to some of our
public men since that time, who I
believe to be deserving, and merit the
esteem of their countrymen.
Yours sincerely,
W. H. McCampbell.
“OLD TIME POLITICS” IN JEF
FERSONIANS.
Sylvania, Ga., R. F. D. No. 1, Box 4.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson,
Dear Sir: Inclosed please find
money order for the Jeffersonian. I
only subscribed for three months and
I think my time was out some time
in November. I regard your maga
zine and the Jeffersonian as two of
the best publications I ever read and
the more I read them the stronger it
makes me in the old time polities.
I have never been anything but a
Jeffersonian Democrat in my life and
expect to stick to the same old plat
form while life lasts.
Always your friend,
W. E. Holley.
FINDS MUCH THAT IS GOOD IN
WEEKLY.
High Shoals, Ga.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson,
Dear Sir: I have been reading your
most valuable paper for a number of
years and have derived a lot of good
information from it. It has helped
me to see through a lot of things
that have always been dark to me
and I feel today that it would be im
possible for me to do without it. 1
hope you will live to see your prin
ciples set up and will enjoy the re
ward that is due you. I have voted
for you every time that your name
has appeared on a ticket, and expect
to vote for you just as long as you
stick to the faith,
ft. J. Martin.
SILENT UNTIL NOW.
My Dear Mr. Watson:
I claim to be a poor writer, or I
would have written to you long since.
But you know it is said silence is
golden. I was the first man in my
county to leave the old party, and
declare for independent political ac
tion, when both old parties repudiated
the alliance demands. I have met the
enemy on the hustings upon almost
every hilltop in my county, defending
our principles. If they were right
then, they are right now. If reform
was necessary then, it is more so now.
I am an old mid-roader, broken down
in health, but ready to go at the first
bugle sound to battle for our cause,
with all the power I.possess. What
thinking man can hope for relief
through the sham battle played by
the two old parties? Look at the game
now on in Congress. Show me the dif
ference in the two old parties except in
name. I believe it is to the interest
of all reformers to get together, call
a convention in the near future, and
formulate some plan by which or
ganization can begin as early as pos
sible. If every old Pop will send in
just one dollar as a campaign fund
we can keep several able men in the
field until Populism is preached in
every county in the Union. Now,
one dollar from every reformer is a
small sum, and I think great would
be the result. Make the call, and
let us rally once more for a cause that
seems to us so just.
Lumpkin, Ga. J. B. Brazier.
WE GAIN KNOWLEDGE BY READ
ING EACH SIDE OF A CASE.
Warthen, Ga.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I have just read your
article on foreign missions in the
April number of your Magazine, and
I am satisfied that if the preachers
will lay aside their prejudices and
confine their attacks to the customs
that are not Scriptural there will be
great good accomplished for the
churches and mankind at large. But
so long as some very noted pastors
will assail you for the simple reason
that you point out those customs and
very pointedly prove there is no
Scripture for them, then there is
trouble. Is it not the part of wisdom
for any minister not to ridicule you
or to say you know nothing of foreign
missions at all, and are not a safe
leader on the subject, while they
claim to like you personally? This
thing occurred today at our church
union in Washington County, Ga.
So stupid are some people that
when you try to inform them they
become wrought up for fear some of
their old customs are not according to
the Book. Do unto others as you
would that they do unto you is for
gotten, and the proper mode of reply
ing to a person through the public
press is discarded and the pulpit is
used as a place to reply to an indi
vidual, and the individual has no
means of answering back. This mode
is weak, unjust, unmanly, and ought
not to be used by any one who is
honest. We gain knowledge by read
ing each side of a case. A juror does
not make his verdict until he has
heard both sides of the case, and
why not give other matters the same
line of reasoning? This means of
Blje fersonlan
replying from the pulpit shows that
there is a sad weakness on the part
of any person who uses the pulpit
instead of his pen to answer a dis
cussion. J. 8. Norris.
ENCOURAGEMENT FROM ONE OF
THE “OLD GUARD.”
Slocomb, Ala., March 25, 1909.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Thomson,
Ga.,
Dear Sir and Friend: 1 here enclose
a P. 0. M. 0. for $2.00 for which you
will please advance my subscription
to both Jeffersonians for another
year.
Brother Watson, I am one of the
“Old Guard” Populists and have al
ways been a Watson man. I even
held my nose and voted for William
Jennings in 1896, just to get to vote
for you. I fully endorse your work,
and I shall always stand by you as
long as you stick to the right. I con
sider you to be the greatest friend
that the poor man has today, who
is engaged in actual work.
May you be spared for many years
to come, so that you may enjoy part
of the fruits of your labor.
Very respectfully yours,
S. M. Maund.
WHEN IT COMES TO CHANGING
BRYAN CAN’T BE BEATEN.

The Weekly Jeffersonian, Thomson,
Ga.,
Dear Sirs and Friends: Enclosed
you will find money order to pay for
one new yearly subscription to Wat
son’s Weekly Jeffersonian, to be sent
to the address you will see on slip
of paper enclosed.
I am a Watson man from my very
heart. I am no man worshiper, but
I do believe that Watson is one of
the true men of this nation. If he
were to prove to be untrue to the com
mon people, we had as well call off
the dogs and give up the fight tor
freedom and submit to the money
power. It looks as if we would have
to submit with Watson or no Watson.
The great and only trouble is that
there are not enough Watsons. One
Watson can’t win this fight, so I do
hope to see more Watsons springing
up all over the land.
As for this old hayseed, he is to the
end of the string as he is in his
seventy-second year, and he has noth
ing to enjoy now but aches and
pains, and that is poor comfort.
Will say I enjoy reading the Jeffer
sonians, as I take them both. It is
mighty hard here to get the people
to read anything but old party papers.
Some of the poor dupes think Bryan
a great man; I say, “Yes, he is great;
when it comes to changing, he can’t
be beaten.” He can change as quick
as a Nebraska wind or a Missouri
mule. They are both quick, but W. J.
B. is equal for any change Wall Street
may require of the oily tongued gen
tleman.
As soon as the weather settles will
try to send a few names to the Jeffer
sonian. I know you have a hard job
and you need help, and lots of it. I
am poor in purse and in health, but
my heart is in the cause for which
the Jeffersonians are battling.
So with the best wishes for you and
the cause.
Yours truly,
A. C. Ditty, I
Heart
Troubles
The heart may be weaK
just the same as the eyes,
stomach or other organs.
It often happens that a
person is born with a weak
heart. Then again dis
ease, fevers, over-exertion,
anxiety, nervousness,
rheumatism, etc. weaken
the heart. The result is
shortness of breath, pal
pitation, pain in the heart,
or in some of the nerves
of the chest or abdomen.
The heart should be
strengthened with a tonic,
and for this nothing equals
Dr. Miles’ Heart Cure.
"I had LaGrippe last fall as I
thought in a mild form. I was weak,
tired feeling, and short of breath:
could hardly go about, and a gooa
deal of the time sort of an asthmatic
breathing and extremely nervous. I
began taking Dr. Miles’ Heart Cura
and Nervine and now I feel so much
better in every’ way. I am so thank
ful that I began taking this medicine,
and shall not heattate to tell others
how much good it has done me.”
