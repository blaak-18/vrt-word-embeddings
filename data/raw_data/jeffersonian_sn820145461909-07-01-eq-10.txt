How He Got Rid
of Consumption
Remarkable Rescue of Prominent In
diana Man. A Matter of Life-and-
Death Interest to All Throat
and Lung Sufferers
For Benefit of Jeffersonian Readers, He
Tells How He Cured Himself at
Home—-Costs Nothing to Try.
“I think I owe it to all sufferers of
lung and throat trouble and consump
tion to tell them some mighty good
news, a sure way to cure themselves
right at home with little trouble,” said
E. S. Stroh, of Angola, Ind., yesterday,
as he passed through.
“Coming from me, probably, some
people might doubt this, but let me tell
you,” he said, as his 66-year-old face
flushed with a resurrected, youthful
smile, “over two years ago I was a
weazened-up wreck, a consumptive at
63. Three lung specialists passed me
up. Every day I would cough up about
a pint. I had chills and fever every
afternoon. I could hardly eat, even the
plainest food, coughed nearly all night,
and was down to 137 pounds when I
hit on the cure. Well, you see me now.
I weigh 166 pounds, frisky as a boy at
66, can do a big day’s work, and eat
like a prince.
“Now I am not trying to boost any
body, but I must give credit where
credit is due. Dr. J. Lawrence Hill,
499 Hill Building, Jackson, Mich., .the
well known lung specialist of America
and probably so far the only success
ful one, cured me. That was two years
ago. I have just had my lungs ex
amined again and there is no trace of
consumption nor danger of its return
ing. Dr. Hill makes a specialty of
treating throat and lung sufferers at a
distance who have not the means of
visiting his office personally. That’s
the way he cured me, and I know of
many others who had one foot in the
grave almost, brought back to life by
what he calls his Rational Treatment.
It certainly is a wonder.
“I wish every reader of your paper
who has weak lungs, catarrh of the
bronchial tubes or catarrh in any form,
chronic bronchitis, asthma, chronic
hacking cough, loss of flesh, night
sweats, hemorrhages, soreness or pain
in the chest or under the shoulder
blades or any other deadly symptom of
consumption, to send to Dr. Hill for his
trial package. This treatment checks
at once further progress of the dis
ease, develops atrophied cell tissues
and brings on new resisting power, ap
petite, flesh and good health.” Fill out

The White Slave Traffic
Dear Mr. Watson:
Your letter of the 31st ult. to Hon.
Clifford G. Roe, assistant state’s at
torney, after a regretted delay is re-,
ferred to this committee for reply.
We return the letter attached to
yours and regret to say that condi
tions are bad in tills and other cities
and that cases are of daily occur
rence in the police courts of Chicago
which SHOW THAT WHITE WOM
EN ARE LIVING WITH BLACK
MEN and that there is at least a ba
sis of truth in what “John Franklin”
states.
You are aware of what we are en
deavoring to do and will be inter
ested to know that considerable
progress has been made during the
last three months. We found that
almost no state had statutes directly
applicable to white slavery and laws
have been secured in Illinois, Min
nesota, North and South Dakota,
Pennsylvania, Colorado and lowa.
We have assurances that legislation
will be enacted in other states as
soon as the legislatures convene. We
have an inquiry from a member of
the Georgia Legislature, but perhaps
you will take up the matter in that
State to assist the agitation and
bring about the enactment of laws
such as were framed for Illinois.
You probably will have recommen
dations to make, but the form of the
three Illinois bills and of the pan
dering act of 1908 are found to be
very practical laws for the purpose.
Your assistance will be greatly ap
preciated and we hope you will keep
in touch with us.
Respectfully,
CLYDE A. MANN,
For the Committee.

ALWAYS THE UNEXPECTED.
“All right behind there?” called
3effersonian
Ed. Note: The letter referred jto
is that of John Franklin, the negro
who declared that negro men could
buy white women in Chicago at from
$25 to SSO apiece. Mr. Watson for
warded a copy of the Franklin letter
to the Chicago “Committee on Legis
lation” of the organization which is
working for the suppression of this
frightful slave-trade.
We earnestly commend to the
prayerful attention of the fanatics
on Foreign Missions that passage of
the Committee’s letter which admits
that there is a basis of truth in what
John Franklin said.
Once again, what did John
Franklin state? He declared that he
had paid SSO for a white wife, and
that he had the pick of twenty-five.
He said that “any negro can buy
white women in my city for $50,”
and spoke of it as a regular thing.
Franklin said that he had had three
white wives in his time and “it is no
trouble to get one.” Said John
Franklin, “WHITE WOMEN IS THE
CHEAPEST FLESH ON EARTH.”
And when Mr. Watson sends
Franklin’s letter to the Committee
which is trying to break up this
damnable slave-trade, asking wheth
er there is any truth in the negro’s
statement, the Committee answers
that there is.
Yet, a certain class of preachers
are assailing Mr. Watson savagely,—
calling him all sorts of hard names,
—because he contends that it is a
mistake to send money into heathen
dom to rescue yellow and brown and
black people from vile conditions,

“By George, I never saw anything
like the effects of that new treatment,
Protone, for the building up of weight
and lost nerve force. It acted more
like a miracle than a medicine,” said
a well known gentleman yesterday in
speaking of the revolution that had
taken place in his condition. “I be
gan to think that there was nothing
on earth that could make me fat. I
tried tonics, digestives, heavy eating,
diets, milk, beer and almost everything
else you could think of, but without
result. I had been thin for years, and

began to think it was natural for me
to be that way. Finally I read about
the remarkable processes brought
about by the use of Protone, so I de
cided to try it myself. Well, when I
look at myself in the mirror now, I
think it is somebody else. I have put
on just 30 pounds during the last
month and never felt stronger or more
‘nervy’ in my life.”
Protone is a powerful inducer of nu
trition, increases cell-growth, makes
perfect the assimilation of food, in
creases the number of blood-corpus
cles, and as a necessary result builds
up muscles and solid, healthy flesh, and
rounds out the figure.
For women who can never appear
stylish in anything they wear because
of their thinness, this remarkable
treatment may prove a revelation. It
is a beauty maker as well as a form
builder and nerve strengthened
It will cost you nothing to prove the
remarkable effects of this treatment.
It is absolutely non-injurious to the
most delicate system. The Protone
Company, 1530 Protone Bldg., Detroit,
Mich., will send to anyone who sends
