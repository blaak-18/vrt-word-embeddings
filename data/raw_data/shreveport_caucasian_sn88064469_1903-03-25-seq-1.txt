pave Heart, the negro who attempted
to kill Tom Dents, colored, a fireman,
died Monday morning from the wounds
inflicted by Officer Lay of the police, by
whom he was pursued eight miles.
The affray between Heard and Dents
occurred ovel a woman Sunday after
noon near Currie's Springs in the Silver
Lake Bottom, during which Dents was
shot four times.
The pursuit 'of Heart in whiAi Offi
cer Rascoe joined Lay, with Chief of
Police Jones, Patro!_nen Adams and
Gilliland and Deputy Sheriff Marma
duke Ward, was enlivened by the re
sistance offered by Heard, who in flee
ing through the brush stopped occasion
ally to shoot at Officer Lay, who was
in close pursuit. After going eight miles,
Heard crossed Dixie bayou and -,ok to
the woods followed by Lay who urged
Heard to surrender, but for reply he
received a shot which fortunately failed
in its aim, and before he could fire a
second shot Lay had responded with
an accurately directed bullet which dis
abled the fugitive. In a little while the
officers on foot and horseback were on
the scene. Heard was taken to the hos
pital, where he was operated on. He had
been shot in the abdomen and leg and
other parts of the body.
The mention of this case is to empha
size the credit which is due Chief of
Police Jones and his officers, including
Deputy Sheriff Ward, who are always
vigilant and active, and to compliment
Officer Lay on his persistent and deter
miled pursuit of a desperate negro,
armed and resisting with shots the ad
vance of the officer. A pursuit of eight
miles through the brush and woods,
across hills and dales, is an undertaking
for which determination and nerve are
essential, and such pursuit is appre
ciated by many of the veterans of war
who have experienced such ordeals and
hardships. With an officer less deter
mined and persistent. Heard would
probably have escaped, but he soon real
ized that his only chance was to cripple
or kill his pursuer. Fortunately Lay
was uninjured and by his action has ,
placed himself in the line of merited
promotion.
And while on this subject we may
add that Shreveport has a police force
which may be ranked with the most ef
ficient, and a feature which should not
be overlooked or underestimated is the
cordiality of the relations existing be
tween the police and the sheriff's de
partments who co-operate intelligently
in all criminal matters.

Shreveport, ta., March 23.-Honor
able Mayor and City Council: Gentle
men-I hand you herewith statement
of approximate cost of. the proposed
street paving.
Acting under instructions I have fig
ured on a price of $2.25 per square
yard on all streets in order to cover the
excess in cost in case some of the
streets named in the estimate are paved
with asphalt.
I have also based my calculations on
narrowing the roadway of almost all of
the streets. from their present width.
This was done in order to make the
money reach as far as possible and yet
give plenty of room on the streets for
traffic.
It will take two or three months of
hard work before we can be ready to
advertise this paving. Before plans and
snecifications can be completed a survey
of each street must be made, and in
many cases the street itself located ac
curately. It is very desirable that each
street be monumented during the pav
ing and ' have included that in my es
timate.
In the matter of drainage each street 31
and each street intersection must be ti
made a study of in itself in order that $
we may have the best results when the t(
paving is completed.
This will require time and labor, and n
I request that I receive your instruc- p
tions promptly and that I be allowed the $
use of two more engineering corps.
It will require two corps to attend to p
this paving and in the meantime the li
regular work can not be neglected. p
I have a large number of memoranda A
of work to be done on my file now and
with this fair weather it will increase. a
The paving surveys and plans will so c
increase the amount of work that un- t
less I have this increased force I must
let one branch or the other go undone 3
or do it all in an unsatisfactory man- t
ner. I have made allowances for this in
creased force in the accompanying es
timate.
In regard to the storm sewers men
tioned in your last instructions, I must
request additional time. These sewers
must he permanently built and must be
large enough to handle all of the water
and yet as a matter of economy not be
larger than is necessary. Very respect
fully, WILKIE WOODARD.
Laid over until Monday, March 3o.
By Mr. Currie
Shreveport, La., Feb. 17, i9o3.-To
the Mayor and City Council: In answer
to an ordinance introduced by Mr. Al
len asking for an official map and the
probable cost of the same, I hasten to
hand you, in advance of the time set.
the estimate of the cost of such a map
and a few remarks on instances show
in r the crying necessity for such a map.
Take as the first instance: The map
of the original town shows that each
of the blocks from Common street are
intended to be just 32o feet in length.
Actually on the grould there is but one
tier of blocks that are only 32o feet in
length, the rest being from -25 of a foot
to 4 feet greater in length than they
should be.
Another instance is Jordan street, one
S in ithe t
iother instance is the Allendale :4
fair, with which you are all *miliar,
and which is gow in gSe courts. Here
there is a surplus of 40 feet actually on
the ground. Mr. Kane took the stan.
that this surplus should he places at
one place. and Mr. Wilson supported
h ,the other engineers that it shoult be
placed elsewhere.
Take the location of Uies'e avenute i.
the Texas toad. Here the conditions ate
dreadfully mixed up; the difference of
location, according 9 the view Voti
take, amounting to between ,S and *3
feet.
Tate Southern avenue. There ties a
difference oy 1e4 feet,-Eairfiel* avenue
the same.
Gentlemen. vot cat gc.s any 9ortion
of the town that you wish, and yost will
find deficiencies that should be adjust
ed, streets that are got where they be
long, go streets where there should be
streets, streets that have been dedicatd
as streets and never opened rho 4.e. are
badly nteeded.
It is not the intention c Ohis s*vey
to disrupt existing conditions or io
raise contentions, but to make an ac
curate map showing these existing vsn
ditions: then if there are deficiencies
shown, . committee of yout honorable
body can be appointed, the engineer to
ict in conjunction with them, and make
such adjustments as glay le deemed
proper.
When #e adjustments are so Ocitt
upon. have permanent gronuments set
defining your streets and alleys so that
future generations of engineers will ob
serve the same points ani thus obviate
he necessity for lawsuits.
This action must he takel at Icme
:ime, sooner or later, and if done now
:an be accomplished for half what it
will cost ten years from now, and dor t
ne-quarter what is will cos* twenty[
years hence.
It will take a veal to accompli[ Lis I
work as it is no small task and should c
ze done with the greatest care and ac
:uracy.
The following table gives you a iv es
imate of the cost of the map and its
iecessary surveys:

Your map committee having tooked
nto the subject and having received a
eport from the city engineer which
:overs the necessity for such a map es- $
)ecially in view of the extensive paving
uemranus.
We present the following resolution:
Resolved, that the city engineer be
and is hereby authorized to organize a
sufficient field and office force to make
such a map as soon as consistent with
the necessity of the work, establish
bench marks, levels, profiles and show
such necessary changes to straighten
streets and their nomenclature where
streets in different sections of the city
have the conflicting numbers or names;
and that the finance committee be au

pay the expense of the work.
