A HORRIBLE CRIME
Murdered In Her Bed at Her Home
In This City.
MRS. ALICE MATTHEWS THE VICTIM O, A NEGRO BURGLAR.
HER DAUGHTER ALINE IS ALMOST KILLED WITH AN AX.
A CLUE LEADS TO AkLIVALY CHAS-THE CULPRIT,
ED PORTER, WAS KILLED BY THE POLICE.
From Sunday's edition, April 12:
A horrible crime was perpetrated dur
ing .Friday nnght, or rather after mid
night, perhaps between 3 and 4 o'clock
Saturday morning, in a home where a
number. of people resided, in a 'two
story dwelling at the corner of Crockett
and Common streets, where the neigh
bors'. houses are within easy touch, in,
we may say, the very heart of the city.
It was not until about 6 o'clock or a
little later thpt the crime was discovered
by the cook, Mary Wells, and the house
maid, Jennie Steins, . who came as
usual to begin their work of the
day. As the kitchen door was reached
there was a startling footprint in blood,
and when the door leading into the
room of the victim was opened there
was a ghastly sceve which shocked in
expressibly the cook, w So with the maid
raised the alarm, when the househol,
were awakened as well as the near
neighbors.
It was a shpcking discovery, which
chilled the blood add for a nmxnent was
indescribably starthng. In giving the
details 6f the crime no sensational, 1
picture or, woods can add to
its horror. It is a crime which is most
volting, the mturder of a woman,
kiled in her own row. on her bed! i'pd

which slh was morn or less bruised
about the body. A second blow from the
ax silenced her forever. When found the
body was partly outstretched on the bed.
near the body of the mother was her
daughter Aline, who was believed to be
lifeless. Awakening when her mother
*as beit murdered, she received two
blows with' the same ax on the skull,
and thet the murderer left hurriedly
this scene of blood, taking nothing with
hint. On Mrs., Matthews' hands were
valuable rings of diamqnds and precious
stones, which' were found on her fingers
as she woo tetem. Her earrings were un
disturbed ,-` her 'ears. As-the murderer
left, he tr in his yicti n's blood, and an
imprint of is footsteps ,would indicate
that he was shoeless but wore his socks.
To ou rnd the motive was robbery,
and the f of detection led to the
crime of jwrder. As to who is tihe criin

ax is the *apon_ used by the negro, but

ACTIVITY OF THE POLICE AND
THE SHERIFF.
When the crime was made lnown to
the police, Lieutenant 3asch being in
charge, he put the *hole machinery of
the police, as it were, in full operation,
notified Chief Jones, who came quickly
to the scene, and who together exqrted
every effort to secure the criminal.
There was no clue, only the bloody ax
and the bloody footprints on the floor,
but the police were diligent and watch
ful.
JURY OF INQUEST.
Soon after the crime had been re
ported, Dr. -Coty, coroner, spmmoned a
jury of inquest, who, after a partial in
quiry, adjourned 4or additional infor
mation.
ALINE MATTHEWS.
When the crime was discovered and
it was ascertained that. Aline Matthews
was not dead, she was removed to
Schumpert's Sanitarium, where she -has
all the care which can be suggested by
medical science andthe attention which
loveful sympathetic hands can -give. Her
condition is precarious and she may not
recover, although there is ente teined
the hope which is -fortifhg an sd bfisful.
A CLUE TO THE C ME.
When it seemed as f the bseorts
to unravel the mysterious msrd weoul
be unavailhag, tbere wiast received
poli e headqaters a nate of warning
whicd" was siguicant-a Regro with
blood- stains .a his shirt awi pants had
met of two men -c0P'nected kith t
Kasisas City Southern. ý)n receiving this
information the activity of the police
was redoubled,' and ;Chief Jones and
Sheriff Ward; each agkeed 6n a plan of
action. Sheriff Ward and a posse trav
eled in the direction of Wallace lake,
while Jones had scattered several squads
of police 'ficers, Johnson, Craddock and
Hum, took the trait down the Kansas"
City $otstiern to the Texas and Pacific
and there :met O~ake Rascoe and others
with a hand-caL After a roead up the
party retraced their course, being on the
trait of the fugitire who, however, had
eluded his -pusuers. In the 4uilntiun
Sergeants Ge4ald and M were
on `oot, travei4 beisty, in shirt
sleeves, when tyb spied a inegr n

This. t m . Rmd by courier to
Chief toner, ate: was;. the vicinity in
another direction. In scattering into
squads as they did, it.was the purpose
of Sheriff Ward and Chief Jones to cut
off the fugitive and catch him at almost
any point. The body of the fugitive was
put into a two-horse 'wagon and hauled
to Willis's, the undertaker on Texas ave
n nue, from where ft will be buried.
The negro killed was aged about 35
years 'and was known as Ed Porter. He
was employed about the Union' Depot
and had relatives in this' city.
And so has ended the career of a man
who while intent on robbery, added mur
der to his crime, the murder of a mother,
the head of a family, and her daughter,
whose life hangs on a thread, and whose
death would intensify an already horri
ble record. A miserable life ended, and
as it was, by being shot to death by un
earing hands, in upholding the law. Bet
ter as it is, better for the people that he
has been slain.
THE UNFORTUNATE FAMILY.
And now a few, words for the aflmicted
of the unfortunate family,- bereft of a
dear, kind, loving mother, renomed as it
were in the twinkling of sa eye. Mut
dared! Horrible ! but no greater crime
was committed. And the littl daughter,
at death's door ! What a s pitture l
Dark and desolate indeed, an4 thir is

old age is is exquisite as wfs the per
feet bloom of her youth.
You wonder how it is her life has
been a long and happy one.
Here are some of the reasons:
She knew hqw to forget disagreeable
things- ,
She kept her nerves well in hand and
inflicted them on nolone.
'She mastered-the art of 'saying pleas
ant things.
She did not expect too much from her
friends.
she made whatever work came to her
congenial.
She retained her illusions, and did not
believe all the world wicked and unkind.
She relieved the miserable and sym
patired with the sorrowful:
She nevei' forgol that kind words and
a smle cost nothing, but are priceless
rehsures to the discouraged.
She did unto others as she woeld be
done by, and now that old age has' come
to her and there is a halo of white hair
about her head, she is loved and con
sidered. This is the secret,of a long life
and a happy one.
