Mrs. C. M. Parkerson enter
tained on Tuesday evening in honor
to of her cousin, Miss Thompson, of
Texas. It has generally been atn
accepted fact that spiders rarely
:e ever invade new houses, but into
9 this pretty new home on Tuesday
cautiously crept a gigantic spider
11 and wove between the folding doors,
1e dividing the dainty dining room
from the cozy parlor, a web of un
usual proportions and beauty, and
from this extended silken threads
'. throughout the whole house. In
r- the meshes of the web two victims
•> were ensnared-one a june-bug,
:e (gold, pearl-eyed june-bug stick
:. pin,) the other a poor unfortunate
a worm, (a rubber one;) the sympa
y thizing, tender-hearted guests were
. everyone anxious to liberate these
victims of the wary spider, and
worked for that end, but the suc
' cessful ones were Misses Ethel Per
kins and Lea Gladu. The decora
g tions of the dining room were pink
and white roses. This color scheme
was furthermore carried out in the
refreshments. Each guest received
as a souvenir of this enjoyable oc
e casion a card bearing an appro
priate quotation. Mrs. Parkerson
- was ably assisted in receiving by
K Mrs. Biossat, Miss Parkerson and

A Negro Politician Severely Pun
Jf ished for his Impudence.
is
L~ Telesmare Paddio, better giown as
ig "Naco," at one time a notorious a' po poli-.
)f tician of this parish, aql a promiqpnt figure
in the black wing of the Republican party
of this State, was,from all accounts, severely
is flogged by the white citizens of Carencro
- and vicinity during the night of Thursday
:o last.
It appears that Paddio acted in a very in
sulting and impudent manner toward Judge
Frank Abbadie, a respected citizen of Car
encro. Mr. Abbadie was quietly reading a
a nnwspaper in one of Ahe stores of the to n
d when Paddio entered and without the leit
. provocation insulted him, using "n
guage of a most abusive nature. Mr. Abba
T die ordered him out and subsequently pro
Sceeded to the mayor's office and made an
s affidavit against him charging him with in
t sult and abuse. A warrant was placed in
the hands of the constable and before dark
Paddio was in the town calaboose.
The people of Carencro and vicinity are
not to be trifled with by impudent negro
politicians, and as Paddio had upon different
occasions rendered himself obnoxious to
them, a number of them, it appears, went
r to the calaboose during the night and took
possession of the distinguished prisoner and
e before the rising of another sun, it is safe to
j say, he was administered the maximum dose
of the very efficacious remedy which the
good people of Carencro generally prescribe
in cases of that sort.
The people of Carencro are disposed to
accord to the negroes even-handed justice,
but they want it distinctly understood that
no impudence and arrogance will be toler
ated from them.
Again on Top.
The president of the Union Club
of Pilette writes The Gazette the
following: "TIe boys went over
I to Carencro last Sunday and played
a game of ball with the club of that
town. The score stood so0 to 6 in
favor of the Unions, once more
exemplifying the fact that our club
was well named Union for in it
there is strength. Our boys desire
to express to the Carencro people
there appreciation of the hospitable
treatment they received while in
that splendid little town. The
Unions have authorized me to ex
tend a challenge to any club in this
parish. They also wish me to state
that they would be pleased to hear
from any club anxious to play a
friendly game for a side bet of 1

SCARENCRO NEWS.
Items of Interest Gathered by The
Gazette Correspondent at
Carencro.
There was a game of ball played
between the Pilette and Carencro
clubs Sunday last. While the home
team lost, the former sustained
their reputation as excellent
players.
Bro. Budro aims to be a little
sarcastic in his account of the game
of base ball recently played between
the Carencro and Scott clubs. The
fact of the matter is that the Car
encro-Sunset combination crossed
bats with the Scott-Pilette "combi
nation," and were vanquished. The
Carencro combine expects, how
ever, to give a better account of
themselves when the two clubs
again try conclusions, Sunday next
in Carencro. Our worthy friend
should learn that there are very few,
if any, base ball clubs made up ex
clusively of home players now-a
days.
Dr. E. Perrault has decided to
locate in Scott. Our best wishes
are with him. Dr. Perrault is a

style, his 73rd birthday last Sunday.
Appropriate toasts were made, by
Father Laforest, Dr. Perrault and
others, which appeared to be heart
ily appreciated by the good old
man. Mr. Prejean was presented
with a large crayon photo of him
self which he accepted with a few
appropriate words of thanks. The
trees were decorated with flags and
streamers of various colors. While
some were playing croquet, others
singing, a number of children were
romping around the grove in merry
glee, all forming a scene that will
long be remembered by those who
were present.
Dr. Lessley has been quite sick,
but is again well and among his

have much to thank our present
Police Jury and School Board for.

Nine bales of cotton shipped from v

The Carencro Sugar Co. will in- b
tall a tr;ple effect in their refinery,
rhich will aid them materially in -
fulfilling their large contracts.
Our merchants and farmers ap
pear to be happy and contented,
which would seem to denote that
te they expect successful crops this
season.
Carencro has a sugar refinery, a
up-to-date cotton gins, 17 stores,
dI hardware store, z drugstore, I
cooperage and cistern factory, a
0 bakery, a lumber yard and 5 sa
e loons. Five years ago it boasted of
d only 5 stores, 2 old-time gins and 6
it saloons. Five years ago we ship
ped 2ooo bales alone. This year
e we should ship nearly ten thousand

- wonderful improvement or not ?

rels and cisterns, which will neces
sitate the employing of several more
men.
Master Luke Crouchet spent sev
eral days last week with relatives in
Rayne.
The fair given at Scott recently,
proves conclusively that our sister
town can boast of some real
"hustlers;" men who know how to
do a thing properly when they
want to, and are able to "down"
petty opposition.
The Carencro brass band will
