1 There will be a grand game of foet

nod yet the falling off in their rare

Between 1850 and 1860 the increase of
the negro uopulatiuu was 803,022, or
twenty.two tIer cent; but between
1860 and 1870 the increase was only
438,179, or a trifle less than ten per
'ent. This was owing in part to the
better care taken of young negro
children in slavery, when they had a
pecuniary value, and in Iart to the
want and misery which prevailed in
the South during the first years of
peace. The South lacks the condi
tions of rapid growth both for its
white and its colored population,
wbile the North. and especially the
Northwest, are increasing as itf by
magic. The political influence of the
South will ponstantly dwindle -by
limition of area, by the slightness of
immigration and by the fact that the
negroes do not multiply in freedom
as they did in slavery. It in ridicu
lous to fear that the declining Southl
will ever regain its old atcendancy in
the federal government.

Dear Sir--After suffering for thirty
years from a running nicer in the ear
ocenesioned .by a wagon passing on my
head and after havilng been operated
upon by Dr. Logan in New Orleans and
and not being lcured. I tried some of your
balm land Inl lhappy to say that after a
few applicationis of it I got entirely well
Sand was radically cnred.
A negro boy on my place cut his foot
with a plow attd it was thought once
that it would have to be amputated but
after applying your balm on Ibe wound
for a few days it healed up and the boy
is now well. Again, George Cole, a
neighbor of mnine, whilst shooting a gun,
a piece of the cap flew in hin eye, we
tried the batn again and with aiceess.
His eye got well after two applications
of the balll.
I conellde by stating that in my opin.
