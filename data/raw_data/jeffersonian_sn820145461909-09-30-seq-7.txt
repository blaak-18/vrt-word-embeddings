POPE HAD BEEN HOO-DOOED.
Dear Sir:—ln the enclosed you
leave the wrong impression on read
er in paragraph marked. One would
suppose you agreed under such pres
sure for Pope to be swapped, before
the swapping occurred. It was after
they put Brown down that you over
came your reluctance. Billy came to
see you in Hoke’s interest after the
deed was done. They made Pope be
lieve you were for his swapping and
that had much to do with Pope’s com
ing down, and he never knew your
feelings until after the transaction.
I was for Pope, and I kept up with
it. He was betrayed by Hoke, etc.
Truly, etc.,
JAMES CALLAWA.Y
Ed. Comment: —I did not even sus
pect that Pope Brown was to be
taken out of the race. When he had
been duped, and Hoke Smith put into
the race, I learned it from the news
papers, as others did. Was aston
ished at what had been done, and in
tensely indignant. Was event
ually brought to acquiesce in
what was too late to undo. But
even then, I did not know that
Pope had been told that I want
ed him to get out of the race
in Smith’s favor. Did not learn that
until the following winter, when
Pope wrote me a long letter explain
ing how he had been side-tracked.

WHY CHRIST DID IT.
“Dear Sir:—l gather from your
articles on Foreign Missions that you
believe that it is all right to preach
the Gospel to the heathen, but to
stop when you have gone that far.
Are you sure that this is the way
Jesus would have us do? If so, please
explain why it was during His own
personal ministry, twenty-four out
of the thirty-six of His recorded mir
acles were wrought for the healing of
the body.
“Please explain in your paper.
“Fraternally,
“W. B. MCDONALD.”
It gives me much pleasure to an
swer the questions asked in the above
letter.
The purpose of Christ in miracu
lously curing afflicted people was two
fold.
(1) To fulfill a prophecy, and
(2) To convince people that he
was the Son of God.
Turn to the Gospel according to
Matthew, chapter 8, verse 17, and
read:
“That it might be fulfilled which
was spoken by Esaias, the prophet,
saying himself took our infirmities
and bare our sicknesses.”
This verse follows one in which it
is stated that Jesus had cast out
devils with his word, and had healed
all that were sick.
One fact, which the upholders of
the medical missionary and the mis
sion pharmacy fails to consider is
that Christ gave no medicines at all.
Neither did he authorize the apostles
whom he sent out to use any earthly
aids in their miraculous curing of the
sick. He wanted to impress his di
vine origin upon the minds and souls
of the people by demonstrating that
he could, without the use of surgery,
medicine, drugs of any description,
heal the sick, restore sight to the
blind, give speech to the dumb and
hearing to the deaf.
Turn to chapter 9 of Matthew,
and read verse 6, where Christ says:
“But that ye may know that the
son of man hath power on earth to
forgive sins, (then saith he to the
sick of the palsy) ‘arise, take up thy
bed, and go unto thine house.’ ”
Verse 7 states, “And he arose and
departed to his house.” Then read
verse 8 and see how Christ accom
plished what he desired.
“But when the multitude saw it,
they marvelled and glorified God
which had given such power unto
men.”
There are innumerable instances
of the same sort, all supporting the
position taken by me in the matter.
I select just one or two others.
Take verse 28, of the 9th chapter
of Matthew where Jesus asked of
the blind men, “Believe ye that I am
able to do this?” And the blind
men answered, “Yea, Lord.” Then
he touched their eyes, saying, “Ac
cording to your faith, be it unto ye”,
and their eyes were opened. They
proclaimed it wherever they went,
and the effect produced upon the
minds of the multitude in verse 33,
w’here the people marvelled and cried
out, “It was never so seen in Israel.”
A clincher is found in chapter 11
of Mattthew. John the Baptist was
in prison at this time, but neverthe
less the fame of Christ had reached
him. He didn’t know whether or
not Jesus was the Messiah, whose ap
pearance he had been heralding. He
sent two of his disciples to investi
gate. These came to Christ and
asked him, (verse 3) “Art thou He
that should come, or do we look for
another?” (Verse 4) “Jesus answer
ed and said unto them, ‘Go and show
John again those things that ye do
hear and see.’” (Verse 5) “The
blind receive their sight, and the
lame walk, the lepers are cleansed
and the deaf hear, the dead are
raised up, and the poor have the
gospel preached to them.”
It was just the same as if Christ
had said, “Who could work such mir
acles as these, excepting the Son of
God? How could any earthly physi
cian restore hearing to the deaf, and
life to the dead? What necroman
cer, what magician, what wizard could
work such wonders as these? Go
and tell John what you have seen me
do: I then leave it to his own mind
to reach the proper conclusion. He
will know by what I have done from
whence comes the source of my mi
raculous power to reverse the order
of nature and set aside the decrees
of fate.”
When he commissioned his disci
ples to go abroad and to work the
wonders he had worked, it was for
the same purpose. He wanted these
pioneers of Christianity to startle the
attention and convince the souls of
an incredulous pagan world, by do
ing, without the use of human in
strumentalities, those things which
no one else could do. His idea was
that the untutored multitudes, see
ing the lepers cleansed and the sick
lifted into health, the lame put upon
their feet, the dumb made to speak,
ISlje Jeffersonian
and the crazy people restored to
sanity, would have faith in the Christ
whose heralds these miracle workers
were.
They were sent to work miracles,
—to cleanse lepers, raise the dead,
cast out devils, —not to diagnose dis
eases, as common physicians do, and
prescribe medicine in the ordinary
way of doctors.
It amazes me to see our people
misled so badly on matters where
their own sound sense applied to
plain language of the Bible, ought
to guide them right.
And to me it seems almost blas
phemous for the pill-mixing mission
ary to go abroad among the heathen,
feeling the pulse, looking at the
tongue, and taking temperatures,
claiming that they are following the
example of the miracle-working
Christ and his disciples. And as to
the Latin countries south of us, they
believe in the divinity of Christ, just
as devoutly as we do. Therefore, the
sending of the “Medical Missionary”
to them is an almost incredible
absurdity, utterly at variance with
Christ’s object in working miracles
and imparting the same power to his
disciples.
In last week’s Jeffersonian I used
a loose expression which may be mis
understood. It was stated that
Christ made no regular business of
curing the afflicted, and did com
paratively little of it. What I meant
to say was, that he did not systema
tize that kind of work. He did not
found hospitals or dispensaries.
That His miraculous healing was in
cidental to his other work: it was
offered to the multitude as addition
al proof of his divine origin. He
did not locate himself in any one
town and become a practicing phy
sician, or surgeon. He went about
from place to place, and as he saw
an afflicted person, or a number of
afflicted persons, he exerted his pow
er upon that particular group, or that
particular individual. T. E. W.

I enclose herein to you an order
for $1 to renew my subscription to
your magazine for one year.
Your August number should be in
the hands of every orthordox preach
er in the land. It makes my very
soul sigh with bitter grief to know
that the enemies of the producers
of wealth by toil and legitimate skill
are, on every hand, so successful in
the destruction of all publications
that advocate the true interest of
all real producers of wealth. The
contest between the people and the
plutocrats is yet to be an awful con
test.
If I was worth millions of money
and property, I would put thousands
of dollars each year into the found
ing and sustaining of Populist pub
lications, for the sole reason of in
dividual and collective interests,
which will be swept away by the in
cendiary acts of oppressed toiling,
deprived and depraved humanity, if
present conditions continue until
that awful oppression shall move the
under class to rebel with wicked fer
vor. My newspaper and job print
ing outfit is idle because of the out
rageous acts of the enemies of the
people, and a lack of greenbacks to
keep it in motion.
