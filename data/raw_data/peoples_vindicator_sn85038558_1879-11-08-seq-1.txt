LIVER PILLS
FOR THE CURE OF
Ispatitis, or Lyer Complaint,
OYSPBPSIA AND SICK USADACHR.
8ymptoms of a Disased Liver.
T.IN in the right side, under the
I edge of the ribs, increases on pres
sure; sometimes the pain is in the left
side; the patient is rarely able to lie
on the left side; sometimes the pain
is felt under the shoulder blade, and
it frequently extends to the top of the
shoulder, and is sometimes mistaken
for rheumatism in the arm. The stom
ach is affected with loss of appetite
and sickness; the bowels in general
are costive, sometimes alternative with
lax; the head is troubled with pain,
accompanied with a dull, heavy sen
sation in the back part. There is gen
erally a considerable loss of memory,
accompanied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done. A slight.
dry cough is sometimes an attehdant.
The patient complains of weariness
and debility; he is easily startled, his
feet are cold or burning, and he com
plains of a prickly sensation of the
skin; his spirits are low; and although
he is satisihed that exercise would be
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely
summon up fortitude enough to try it.
In fact, he distrusts every remedy.
Several of the above symptoms attend
the disease, but cases have occurred
where few of them existed, yet exam
ination of the body, after death, has
shown the LIVER to have been exten
sivelv deranged.
AGUE AND FEVER.
Da. C. McLANs's LIVER PILLS, 1N
CASES OF AGUE, AND FEVER, when
taken with Quinine, are productive of
the most happy results. No better
cathartic can be used, prepaatory to,
or afer taking Quinine. We would
advise all who are afflicted with this
disease to give them a raIR TaA.
For all bilious derangements, and
as a simple purgative, they are un
equaled.

INDIAN SUMMER.'
BY MRS. ESTELLE HAYDEN.
Beautiful Indian-summer is here
The May.time of Autumn, the pride of
of the year,
With mornings and evening so pleasant
ly mild.
And ruid-day so radiant with Summer's
last sale.
Now Summer and Autumn walk hand in
hand
The mission of each to bless the fair land.
And o'er the landscape a faint haze is
spread
The far.well of Summer which soon will
be fled.
Like the hectic lush and glistening eye
Of the one whom De.th's arrow has
stricken to die,
So the flowers put on their most brilliant
array
Near the close of this their life's fleoting
day.

year is the worm Itself.
This is peVhapsb a new theory,
be It it e*rraioaly 't with intelI.
Restc anal bro. and is full of inter
est. Many of the most thoughtful
observers of this subj-ct maintain
that I' Is during the lit)rnatlng pe
rind that the wrn can he most suo
oPeufully attacked. TMny, indeed,
believe and insist that the worm
hibernates in the fields under ground,
and that by winter plowing and con
sequent exposure to the cold the
worm can be practically destroyed.
Theorists of this latter class sustain
their proposition by showing that
the worm has prevailed to a far
greater extent since than before the
war fall and winter plowing was the
rule; whereas, since the war, it is
the exception. There may or may
not be something in this. It
must undergo the Investigation of
solence along with the mass of the
ories growing out of the inquiry and
its disoussion.
As the matter stands, we know of
nothing which answers better than
Paris green as a weapon against the
develeped and matured worm,
though It is very certain that If any
agent equally destructive could be
applied to the worm nl the earlier
stages of its development, far better
results would be obtained. No doubt
Prof. Riley will give this feature his
most earnest attention, for since
there is a period at which the worm
is Inert, torpid and helpless, that pe
rlod s the one at whlch to attack It,
if attack be praeticable. A matter
of the very first moment is to as.
certain all the facts relative to the
htbernation of the worm and to de.
vise some means, if possible, of dos
troylng It at that stage. In conclu
sion, we call especial attention to
what Dr. Gillespie says concerninl
burds, and commend it to the con
sideration of the authorities as well
asof the planters in every part of1
the cotton belt:
This present year, 1879, the cotton

ST. Josue, October 28.
lon. A. J. Duncan, president state
convention of the Republican par.
ty of L ,uslana:
Dear Sir -Yours lated October 221
reached me yesterday. It is with
treat surprise I learn the action of
the convention towards myself. Had
the slightest intimation reached me
in time 'hat such action was propos
ed, I could have prevented some lit.
eis trouble. Although always deep.
ly interested in the welfare of our
state and thegeneral country, I have
never in the first sense of the word,
been a politician, and do not propose
at this late day to enter the political
arena. While I firmly believe that the
principles of the national Republican
party are the best in sight for the
government of this nation: while I
believe in a strong national govern
ment for national affairs; In a dollar
that is worth one hundred cents; in
proteolion of all: in equal rights,
and while 1 believe that the ides of
a solid South has been, and it it
prevails always will be an "iliad of
wars" to Southern peo , I am not
vain enough to think th any offer
of mine nla the use of my name will
materially promote the spread of
peace or retard the progress of soll.
difloation. Even could I be convine.
ed that such might be the case, that
as one of your standard bearers I
might do something for the general
good, my business positively forbids
such atlan. Given a free vote ands
fair count I feel confident the ticket
will win in December whether my
name is on it or not, and without a
free vote and a fair count the name
of George Washington hlmself would
avail nothing. I sincerely thank
the convention for the compliment
to me but for the reasons given
above i must beg leave to decline the
nomimtlon.
I sam, sir, very respectfully, your
obedient servan,
J.Aes M. OILLSPIEr,
