CoLfrtAt.tr , July 7.-Dear Sir-In your
last paper you infonu us that Mr. Carver
bad discovered cotton eaterpillar eggs in
large numbers on his cotton. I tLink
that Mr. Carver in mistaken and that,
which Ie mistook for the moth eggs were
minulte insects, commonly called lice or
nits. I have never met with a planter
who had event tioticed the caterpillar
eggs, until I pointed themas to him. un
less be had been. asown them previously
by some person who had been taught by
me how to indi them I diseoverd them
twenty-live years ago. If you desire to
fliresee the advent of caterpillars, look
carefully under the leaf. unless you have
very good eyes, you will not perceive a
small ball about the size of a pin head,
of a glutinous substance andl blue color
whetn removed careftully from the under
part of the leaf; but apparently green
whilst on the leaf, assnnuing by prox.
inity the green color of the cotton leaves.
When a planter can walk through his
field and plnek in different parts of
it about a dozen cotton leaves without
tdllig these eggs, he need not fear the
near appearance of the army worm.
Our cotton crops are improving rapid
ly since the favorable rains of the 4th and
5th. Very small quantity of corn will be
benllited by the rain as most crops were
too far advanced.

From our lecial Reporter.
The grand pic-nic near Terenee Chaler'sI
took place last Tuesday, according to
previous arrangement. Owing to the in
ability of some of the prominent members
of the Brass Band, to leave their homes
t hey had concluded not to attend, when l
they were visited in their Band Room on
Manday night by Mr. Thos. l'lanner atdl
at hiis enraest solicitation determinedto
Itlltill their acceptance of the invitation
extended to them even at the risk of
their reputation as anmateur musicians.
Promptly at 10i o'clock p. n. the Balnd
S:ssembled in front of Lacoste's hall atid
snugly stowing themselves in buggies
anid R. P. Hlntson's comfortable vehicles,
hied away through the streets. down
" Cane river and in the darkness to Mr.
SFhlanner's residence. The ride along the
S.usty road, at night, was a most pleas
ant one, the atmosphere being cool and
the fllingdew laying the otherwise fly
ing dust. At 2 a. m. the Band reached
Mr. Flanner's residence, where every fa
s cility was afforded them to take a short
"nap" ere resuming their journey ere the
dawn.
At early morn, when Aurora was paint
ing the skies with her, rosy tinge, the
"boys" were aster and awake, and taking
their instruments, gave to their host
and his most estimable mother some of
their music in return for their generous
hospitality.
After enjoying a most substantial re
past the Band proceeded to the residence
of Mr. Terence Chaler, where they were
greeted by a large assembly of
fair 1 adies and gentlemen from lower
Cane river, Cloutiervitle and Montgome
ry. After discoursing music whose
"charms bath power to sooth the savage'
they wended their waS to the pie-nit
grounds, beck of Mr. Chaler's place.
r Hot and ltry are o names for the
state of the atmosphere on this particular
morn. It actually seemed as if the heat
of the past few days had concentrated on
this particular tnoom to intimidate pleas
are seekers. Nothing deterred, the peo
ple wended their way across rough open
ground, along beds of dried up streams,
through woods umbrageous with inter
laced foliage and. pendant moss through
a newly cut passage to the banks of Dry
river, about four miles from Mr. Chaler's.
The spot seleeted had been naetly cleared
of undergrowth and was carpeted Iwith
Nature's handiwork, in comparison with
which man's genius sinks into insigni
fieance.
About 125 ladies and gentlemen were
present. The strains of the Band music,
an nauusual sound in those solitudes, soon
awakened the slumbering echoes :of the
surrounding woods. Iasie. fair. (and
Stheir nnmber were not a few) and gay
t laddies made eternal vows of constancy
Sneath the monarchs' sbadows, or gathered
* in groups, sag strains of sentimental
and comic songs, notwithstanding the
atmosphere was not only sultry, bat me
I tually stifling. Great drops of perspirs
, tion oozed from the pores of the Ileasure
seekers, and dyed their garments witr
.nmoistare. Oneof the great mistaks Of

SEvery one suffered more or less from
thirst and at 3 o'clock p. m., the pleasare
Sseekers deserted the spot, returned to
SMr. T. Chaler". residence, on Cane river.
Here they were received with thrt gea

Gathered on the broad piaszas of his
Sresidenoe, the smembly found a most de

coursed some of their fiaest selections.
a At night there was a dance to wind up
e the day's festivity. This reporter stayed
not but hied homeward with the members
of the Band. While ae route they were
hailed at the elegant residence of Dr. J.
A. Leveque, and ianvited to tarry for
' awhile. Prof. Petssch, followed by the
- members of the Band presentt, accepted
the kindly invaitation and eantered the
residence wherethey were cordially wel
ceomed by Mrs. Leveque, C. N. PrudLom
me and lady, and several gentlemen ad
ladies, who had congregated to honor
the Band with that hospitality, which
oaily the cultivated and refined know
how so well to estend.

music both voaesl and instrumental, and
a couple of hours spent in the most
pleasurable enjoyment of the whole trip.

HUBLEY-On Friday July 11th, 1879,
in this city at 4 o'clock, BmtLL Zooa,
consort of Florian Hubley, aged 3 years.
The subject of this obiuary came
among us it seems but as yesterday a
fair young bride, with the glow of heslth
on her cheeks and the love-light in her
eye. Yet in the prime of her woman
hood and wifehood, the fell Destroyer
laid his icy fingers upon her, and that
insidious disease consuaeption, whieh
"comneth as a thief in the night," and
whose fair promises are but deceitful
hopes laid its wasting power o her
youthful frame.
Wife, mother, dau hter-gentle, affeo
tionto sad kind, in every relatiom of
life, has paeed away, as a obild that
falleth asleep, leavin iiconsolable rela
tives to morn her early demise.
"She is not dead, but sleepeth."
See! from the dark and silent tomb
A ransomed spirit rise.
From out of Earth's despairing gloom,
Into the eternal skies.
The dead bath only gone before
Into the realms oftblies,
And as they reach the far-offshore,
They beckon us fkom this.
Weep not. From out the deep'nin
Now comes a gentle voiee,
"There's hope beyond the silent tomb;
Grieve not: bat still rejoice,
We e'er await the loved of earth
Say tothem-Do not grieve
The amoe Spirit that gave them birth
Is e'er ready to recive."

Dear Sir-I havetried the disncruetant you
are the agent for thoronghly. We have bree
uadng it for several weeks. I did this as a per
soual favor to you, for I generally dislike msa
king enperlments. I can only amy that I sa
glad that I have given the disaincrustant a trial
for it hs taured out by far the best thing of
the kind that I ever used. It Come up toall Its
claime on its printed clrcular, and ln fIktu I
shall recommend Messrs. A Thompson A Co.
to use it eclusively in their Ioillrs over an
I in preference to any other process for disoruse
ls bollers.
