From tlin N. Y, Sun.
Wo learn from tba Attakapsiw Sen
tinel that tho whitfl citizen« of tho
parish of St. Martin in Lofliniana

its municipal and parochial organi

not work of spoilatiott. Tho commu
nify is covered with tho gloom of tdj
joct poverty, deBpair, and mortal
agony.; Unable to pay tho taxes-—
their homes are sold -by the auction
eer, and whilo a largo portion of the
parish in under water, its taxes have
been raised from, p $11,000 to $18.000
by Keljogg's police jnrj. Tho courts
are partisan dens. The millions that
an impoverished people have paid for.

Tho address, of which those are
the chief points, is signed by a large
number of citizens, mostly of French

was called for Sunday, tho 11th mst.

Tested. Tînt, while the formation of
such a white league must, be deeply
regretted, it Is only wluit was to have
been expected. Tho negroes have
lonß been organized,.-and it is but
natural that the whites should organ

in a State where public plunder has
been carried so far that private*prop
