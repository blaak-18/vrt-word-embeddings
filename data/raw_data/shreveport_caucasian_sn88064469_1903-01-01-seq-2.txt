An enthusiastle masculine reader of
Mrs. 8. P. McLean Greene's new story,
"Winslow Plain." writes to her to say
that her mention of "doodles" stirred
keen memories of his youth. of which
one of the dearest delights was hunting
doodles; that he has been pretty much
over the world and has neve'r seen
them mentioned in literature before.
lie adds that they appear in no dic
tlonary, and their selentifie name he
does not know.
Mrs. Greene says in her story that
the "doodles dwelt in their little homes
like ant heaps. They were, not ants.
They were mysterious undlerround
dwellers with foreboding horns and
other fascinating paraphernalia." The
boys used to lie 'with their faces to
the earth. Mrs. Greene says, and call.
"Doodle, do.'le. doodle." and the doo
die invariably appeared, even after a
half hour's wait, gave one look at the
boy and disappeared.
"Why was it." writes Mrs. Greene.
"that this one look from his doodle
was bliss to a boy and that thereafter
he, too, returned inward to his slate
and betnch with a sense that some
cratfug element of his life had been
rounded into happy completion?"

It Is interesting to Imagine the sea
mations of the fanatical Brownlingites
who were forced to listen to S1r Ed
ward Clarke's reeieut address on Eng
lish literature. Itobert Browning, he
declared, was the Carlyle of poetry,
and he could only hope that two-thirds
of what he wrote might be forgotten.
Carlyle tried to debase English as
much as he could possibly do; yet his
lives of Schiller and Sterling were
written in as pure and beautiful .ung
lish as could be found. But Frederick
the tireat was a calamity to itnglish
literature. In the amne way Robert
Browning wrote those delightful pieces
"Christmas Eve," "Enater" and "Men
and Women;" btut how he ever per
suaded himself * - write "The lied Cot
ton Nightcap C'ountry" was a mystery.
His Ipotry would he enjoyed for gen
erations to come - but In volumes of
extrclts, not by those who attempted
to read the volume of his works.-New

Searfs, single and double, are much
affected, and the long stoles of mink
or some other fur seem to be very well
liked. They do not come up no high at
the neck as the collars and so are
scarcely as generally becoming, but
on the other hand they have a more
novel look. Some of the neck pieces
have so many talls that they really de
tract from the vaule of the fur. Dyed
fox makes pretty fur pieces for every
day, and mink made so that the stripes
form fancy designs s iquite a novelty
and in consequence desirable. I$ome of
the stoles reach almost to the feet.
