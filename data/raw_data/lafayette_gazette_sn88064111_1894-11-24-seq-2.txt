of the meeting which was

esmewa Hooker, Cathings
i; ' afl e distinguished statesmen
nib d letters encouraging
a let. oemt from Senator George
idGov. Stone were read. The
seaolutions printed below show the
abo.shsense of the meeting and the
.e±oenee and demoralizing ef
.. -, Qf the :evil which seems to crip
:::the chief industry of the South
r.' StaStes:
• Rsolved, That it is the judgment
of hlsb convention, composed of
Splanters, merchants, cotton buyers,
ibankmrs and . reprentatives of all
. business, professions and vocations,
.lthat the species of gambling known
as dealing in futures exercises the
ost .hurtful and baneful effects
ap.on the prices of cotton, grain
-iand other commodies embraced in
:th: socalled contracts, through
whkch such dealing is conducted.
Tha Saw of supply and demand
which we fully recognize, has long
since eawsed to be the chief factor
in faing and' regulating prices. A
large part of the business of the ex
changes in such cities as-New York,
New Orleans and Chicago comes as
a result of the rapid growth of this
form of gambling. By the making
.' future contracts, which are not
intended to be executed by the de
livery of the commodities named
-n them, the commodities them
selves often remain without pur- h
b~hsers, glutting and depressing the
•~°iet while- at the same time
t_ rough these flictitious contracts
tSe.are nominally bought and sold
in unlimited and impossible quanti- i
ties.
"'A reference to the flictitious
dealings in .a single exchange will
sueice to indicate their extent.
For many years the New York Cot
ton Exchange has done little except i
to bet on the price of cotton; at a
this exchange, in a single month,
the sales (bets) of flictitious cotton
have reached the total of the average
crop of the United States-8,ooo,
coo bales-and in one year over
5o,000o,oo bales, while the sale of 4
actual cotton during the same year
at New York was only 193,000ooo
bales, and the net receipts of actual
cotton at that port were only 0o7,
coo bales. The operation is sim- I
play gambling as to the prices of
ttlie :commodities, and those en
gaged in it, finding it easier and,
therefore, more profitable to them- E
selves to depress prices systemati- I
cally labor, by means of fictitious t
salts, exaggerated estimates and
Jhostile predictions, assiduously dis- t
seminating through circulars and
other publications, to create a gen
eral opinion that will demoralize I
the market and lower prices.
"The following extract from a
pamphlet received, issued by Lath
am, Alexander & Co., of New York,
who are large dealers in futures, C
shows clearly that prices can be F
- eontrolled by such gambling trans- e
- actions: 'If any market for con
--.tracts (cotton futures) smaller than
ours should attempt to sell down
prices against quotations in New c
York dealers here could within f
twenty-four hours offer to sell more
cotton than they could buy.'
WVe indignantly repudiate the in
solent contention of these schemers
and gamblers that the producer ob- ii
Rains through such transactions a
steadier and more wholesome mark
et, and on the contrary, assert the
belief that great good would result t
:if the whole brood should be pre- a
.e-nted from pursuing their.nefa- u
rious occupation and compelled to
snrtheir livelyhood by honest and
#ejttmate methods.

SMiabeai i Lamar Towns, the
Georia poet-lawyer, who is now
swh a ptuides iqldifga In Brook=
ha court circes, came to the front,
the other day, with a plea for chiv
alry in the law.
kIt seems that Miss Estelle Kos
ter fell down in the Brooklyn Turk
ish bathrooms and was injured.
She sued for Slzo,oo damages.
The defendants claimed that Miss
Koster was injured while she was
playing tag in Turkish bath attire,
and they demanded the privilege of
examining her person in order to
establish the truth or falsity of her
story.
Mr. Towns strongly oppose.! this
course and filed the following re
markable protest:
It is manifest that a pure and modest fe
male would be greatly embarrassed and
shocked if she should be compelled to sub
mit to the manipulations and the hired gaze
of a corporation expert, retained for that
purpose.
The inviolability of her person would be
as much fanvaded by compelling her to strip,
as f the court should order the defendant to
administer the cat-o'-nine-tails to her back.
To compel a woman to lay bare her chaste
and sacred body and submit it to the torch
of a paid expert without lawful authority is
an nladignity, an insult, an outrage so glar
ing that It would readily occur to any one
who had combined the study of Blackstone,
Kent, the Revised Statutes of the Code of
Civil Proceedure with the precepts of the
golden rule, the letters Lord of Chesterfield
and the rules of politeness.
The law in its precepts and administration
is not inimical to charitable and chivalrous
actions, but responds to the simple rules of
politeness more readily than to the rigid
edicts of stare decisis.
When the learned judge was con
fronted with this striking jumble of
law, chivalry, etiqutte, morals, sense I
and sentiment, he at one retired in
to what might be called a judicial
fog, informing Mr. Towns that he f
would see him later, or in other t
words stating that he would reserve i
his decision.
The gallant Georgian's manage
ment of the case has made him very t
popular with the women, and it
goes without saying that they will I
do what they can to throw business
into his hands.
THE TARIFF AND THE COMING
SESSION OF CONGRESS.
Philadelpkia Record (Dem.): MIr.
Bayard thinks that Congress at the
short session should pass the bills t
for free raw materials and give the !
people two years' opportunity of ob
serving the working of revenue re- I
form before they shall again be re
quired to elect a President and Con- I
gress. Mr. Bayard is right. The c
bills to put iron ore and coal on the i
free list should be passed, and the
manifest errors and omissions of the
Wilson bill corrected. If the t
Democratic party should be able to t
go to the country in 1896 with the t
policy of free raw materials well es
tablished, and rid of the income tax t
incubus, there is no reason to doubt I
that it would command the same re- 8
sponsive approval on the part of the -
people that it obtained in 189o and
1892. u
C/h:.crgo Hera.d (Dern.): Am
bassador Bayard's opinion is un
doubtedly sound. His advice to!
pass the free materials bill imme- c
diately is wise. This ought to be i
done not in any resentful spirit, but
because it is right to do it, and be
cause the country should have a
fair chance to observe the practical
workings of a Democratic tariff be
fore the passy judgment on it in x896.
Ballimnore Sunt (Dens.): Elected
in November, x892 upon the same a
platform with Grover Cleveland, a
the present Congress still owes to h
the American people the faithful d
and loyal fulfillment of every pledge s
upon the faith of which a majority u
of its members were elected.
Petersbsuprg ( Va.) IJ'ndeux-Atcal
(Dems.): We d, not think there is
any general demand for free iron itr
ore and coal, and we do not believe 0,
that if the free list were extended so D
as to embrace them that the condi
tion of the Democratic party would w
in any respect be improved. The
result in West Virginia. a mining c
State, is conclusive evidence to us
that such a proposition would bring f5
about defeat in that State in 1896 as 1t
crushing and as inevitable as last j
T'uesday's disaster. t
.eo York TimNes ()Den.): The a
suggestion of Ambassador Bayard is 1
logical enough. It is, of course, d
desirable thait "the country shall be
able to :ontemplate the Demccratic
sde of the tariE in full working or- c
der for two ,ears. before' ranthd r t1

Saetigrore Herald (lind.): What
- have been -called derisively . the
."popguin" blls are before the Sea
S ate for action, but it is likely they
s will all be dispbsed of in short or
s der, for the Teason that they are an
, tagonistic to the Gorman tariff bill,
f and for the more important reason
that notice has been served on Con
r gress that the people have had quite
enough of tariff tinkering for some
years to come. The outlook ac
cordingly. will appear to indicate
that nothing will be done prior to
the holidays, and little afterward,
beyond passing the appropriation
bills.

A Worthy Institute.
We are in receipt of the follow
ing communications which are self
explanitory. It is to be hoped that
every parish that can see its way
clear to help this worthy instLtution
will respond liberally to this call
for aid:
New Orleans, Sept. 25th, 1894.
To the Honorable Members of the Police
Juries of the State of Louisiana:
Gentlemen-The Eye, Ear, Nose
and Throat Hospital of New Or
leans, not being a State Institution,
cannot under our Constitution par
ticipate in the Charities of the
State. In responce to its petition
for assistance the Legilature has,
therefore, adopted House Concur
rent Resolution No. 22a, which I
commend to your special attention, I
and trust you may be able to ren
der assistance to this noble institu
tion, which is of great benefit to our
suffering poor thronghout the State,
and which requires financial aid to
continue its benevolent mission.
Respectfully,
MunRP:- J. FOSTER,
Governor.
New Orleans, Nov. 9th, 1894.
To the President and Members of the Police
Jury of the Parish of Lafaytte.
Dear Sirs-I have the honor of
transmitting herewith a copy of a
letter addressed to you by Gov.
Murphy J. Foster, and a copy of the
last annual report of this hospital,
to which I refer you for particulars.
This Hospital has been giving
free treatment to the poor of this
city and country parishes of Louis
iana for the past five years without
a cent of contribution from this
State, and its scope of usefulness
has been extended to such a point!
that we find our-selves compelled
to appeal to you for whatever con
tribution you may feel able to give
annually.
Since the opening of the Institu
tion in December 2889, up to to the
1st, inst, 172,866 consultations were
given and 3.977 operations per
formed. We have given treatment
to 24,574 persons of which 2,960
were from the parishes of Louisiana
outside of this city.
Should you act favorably upon
our appeal, kindly transmit the
amount you may desire to donate,
to Mr. Walter F. Stauffer, corner
Customhouse street, New Orleans,
Louisiana.
We deem it proper to add that
none of our officers and surgeons
are paid. Respectfully,
Jos. A. Hxcgs,
Secretary.
Have you tried this office for job
work? If not, do so. We will
print you letter heads, bill heads, '
and all kinds of commercial work'
as cheap as anywhere else. ,We
have no artists in our office, but we
do claim to to do plain printing to
suit any reasonable person. Give
us a trial.
The Discovery Saved His Life.
Mr. G. Coillouette, Druggist, eavcersville,
Ill. says: "To Dr. King's New Dis. orcry I
owe my life. Was taken with LaGriphipeand
tried all the physicians for miles abmut, but
of no avail and was given up and told I
could not live. Having Dr. Kings New
Discovery in my store I sent for a bottle and
'began its use and from the first dose began
to get better, and after using three bottles
was up and about again. It is worth iti
weight in gold. We dont keep store or nou-e
without it." Get a free trial at Wm.
Clegg's Drug Store.
The brightest beam that has thus
far struggled through the clouds that
