The Knights of Labor, in session
at New Orleans, passed a resolu
tion, on the 23d, protesting against
the issue of the W50,000,000 bonds
by the government, and charac
terizing the same as an unmitigat
ed fraud and outrage upon the
toiling masses, in flagrant viola
tion of existing laws, and intended
solely for the interest of the money
.powers and a bond-holding aris
tocracy.
Reuben F. Kolb was sworn in as
Governor of Alabama, on last C
Saturday by a Notary Public in I
the presence of about 300 of his C
followers, who maintained the most t
quiet and orderly behavior; but a
the usurpes and ballot-box thieves, I
were se afraid of the righteous in- c
digation of an outraged people t
that they thought it necessary to a
have the State militia present, t
which glorious, thbugh expensive s
farce was indldged in galore. c
Mr. Kolb's piupob in taking the I
oathof ooe, seems to be simply r
to sign the ertilcates of election f
of the Popuilet senator and con- I
greem en, who have been counted a
eartin that State. By so doing, ii

gate Alabama methods of holding o
sactose,,which methods have be- a

rRaise The Price Of Cotton.
E More than seven millions of peo
ple in the United States are con
nected with the production of raw
cotton, to say nothing of those in
terested in its manufacture and its
r. transxportation to and from the
r. factories and its sale from the pro
d= ucer to the consumer.
We hear no compllaint from the
consumer that the price of manu
factured cotton is too high, except
when compared with the price of
Sraw cotton by the producer hmn
Sself, nor do we hear the manufac
tories grumbling about the price
of the manufactured product being
too low, but we do hear one con
tinuous wail from the producer of
• the raw material that the price of
cotton is below the cost of produc
n tion, and the justice of this com
plaint is now admitted by all pro
fessions and industries.
The manufacturer of cotton,
' himself the only consumer of the
e raw material and hence the only
one legitimately interested in cheap
cotton, is beginning to realize that
the cotton producer under normal
conditions is his best customer for
n manufactured cotton goods, and
that the decline of cotton prices
has cut off in exactly the same ra
tio the consumption of cotton goods
and therefore that low prices are
r not the best even for the manu
e facturer.
k Then if some inventive genius will
e discover the lever by which we can
raise the price of cotton, his name
will go down to posterity along
side of, but more sacred than,
Whitney, Fulton or Edison.
"Necessity is the mother of in
t vention," however, and out of that
source must come the powerful
B agency that shall bring the sun
shine of prosperity and gladness
all over our Southland again.
Now, we do not wish to be un
derstood as looking for the funda
mental cause of the present low
price of cotton, nor for a plan to
remove that cause; for we firmly
believe that the system of wage.
slavery fastened on us by financial
legislation is the casse, as it enables
money kings to dictate the price
of cotton, wheat and every other
product of the farm, by regulating
the volume of money in circula
tion.
This miserable system was de
clared in wdvance (Hazzard Circu
lar) to be! more profitable than
chattel slavery, and hence the lat
ter was abolished by the enthusi
astic devotees to christianity and
human rights, who afterwards be
came the unwitting instruments in
the hands of shrewd schemers
against human liberty, to fasten
this system of wage-slavery upon
us. And we are quite as firmly
convinced that the removal of this
primary awse of the trouble by
restoring to the government the
function of issuing money in suf
ficient volume to meet the legiti
mate demands of business-taking a
it out of the power of any set of
individuals to control prices, by
controlling that volume, will per
manently correct the evil and re
store, not only the cotton belt, but 1
the whole country to its wonted I
prosperity.
But while we are waiting for the
"legal delay"-the political revo- I
lutiomns thatmust come before we
can change the legislation that has
produced our present systems, we
naturally turn to a temporary re
lief--something to mitigate the <
evdil, until the deadly "Upas" can C
be uprooted and east out of the t
body politic. I
We propose then to analyse eve
ry plan or suggestion made in the c
interest of a higher price for cot- a
ton, ad especially do we urge an t
examination of the merits of the t
two plans embodied in the resolu- a
tans, appmearing elsewhere in this o
isue.
These plas were omfered, and E
will be reofered, to the Cotto d

We will attempt to discuss in
this issue only the plan offered by
Mr. S. E. Russ. which is embodied
in the first.six resolutions referred
O to above, and which amounts prac
I tically to the formation of an or
- ganization of cotton growers,-and
e their friends, who will bind them
selves to grow no more cotton at
the present destructlve.prices.
'e The only questions to be met
are, "Is it practical ?" and "will
it accomplish the desired result ,"
ºf To the first, we answer that this
'-is the age of organization and
combine, every law upon our stat
c ute books seem favorable to the
g formation of mighty combinations,
the history of the United States is
a record of the mighty results of
ºf organized effort among the masses
of the peolle, but to come nearer
home and to more recent efforts,
we cite the Farmer's Alliance and
the various labor organizations
w, hich, without any well-defined
e purpose in view, or any very bril
y liant leadership, have risen to be
pl factors in national events, and
it have settled questions equally as
it momentous and difficult as the teum
ir porary elevation of the price of
d cotton.
s If it he a fact that the present
I- price of cotton is much below the
is cost of production, and that there
e are other crops to which a farmer
I- can turn, for at least a hare living,
without a constant loss of capital
11 invested, and we presume no rea
n sonable man will deny this, it seems
e that the least possible agitation of
g the information would cause a ma
, jority of our farmers to abstain
from that course which Is surely
sinking their farms under mort
,t gage as fast as the years roll on;
I while a reasonable amount of en
- ergy and time expended by a de
B termined and persevering leader
ship ought to organize a body of
- such intelligence and magnitude
i that it would control public opin
ion in the cotton belt, and dicta'te
, tne cotton acreage. There never
was a more auspicious moment for
any organization, than for such an
I one at the present, and it should in
a few months grow to such massive
proportions and so completely
control public sentiment as tc make
it a diagrace to grow cotton to the
injury of the individual and the
community.
The answer to the second ques
tion is by no means so easily dem
onstrated. The history of cotton
production in this country shows
two great instances of decrease,
one by artificial causes, during the
late war and the other by natural
(or as some woul(l say "Providen
cial") causes, notably the crops of
1892-3 and 1893-4.
In the first instance of decrersed
production the cotton belt was the
scene of a war that engaged many
men. The cotton producers stop
ped the production of cotton
and engaged in a business that, if
it did not pay better, at least .en
abled them to wear plenty of cot
ton clothes; and this "businese"
called a great many more men to
the same "business" which paid
them even better, and in a climate
that requires cotton.clothes. So
that while the cotton production
was cut offby the erstwhile pro
ducersengaging in something else,
the demand for cotton goods was
very largely incressed and tshe de
sand wa asccompanied by the ability
to bwy, because the men were en
gaged in a "business" that suppli- i
ed their necessities. So that this C
decrease in the production of cot
ton very largely mincreased the
price of cotton.
But in the second great instance
of the decrease in the production
of cotton in this country, we find
the producer putting his whole a
time into the effort to produce b
cotton and so when Providencial b
or natural causes decreased the t
production, the producer's ability
to by ad setkis .ussusies (or the I
demand) was dorerssed and hence o
the price went down instead of up.
There is:every reason why this i
shouldbeso. The cotton produc- e
er and those diretly interested in d
that bnelaalZare theselves the o
yreatm oinsmer c atiaon goods a
becau e thI live is the mild cli
metes where only lihtcelothes can I
I be worn for a greater part of the
year, hence when their labor is un
Srequited by a short yied. (]r by
a h w lreice on a large yill.d, their
Sability to buy,, and not their acc:rr(i-.
tiEs. is uet off.
SA:otlihr (t, our ninil thle iiost
- .potent of all);kfictor in raisin g the
Sprice of cotton during the first
great declinein production (1862.6),
t was the fact that the producer was
I not only being paid for his time
lost out of the production ofcotton,
but he as well as his brother on
the other side the line were being
paid in an entirely new issue of
money that was making the total
amount of money in circulation
greater every day until it reached
in 1866, fifty-two dollars per capi
ta. In 1892-3, when the cotton
production was again decreased
for two successive crops, the
amount of money in circulation
had been reduced to less than fif
teen dollars per capita, and has
not ilncreased since, so while the
wants of the people (the demand)
for cotton goods was as great as
ever, anti greater, and tue supply
of cotton less than it had been for
several years, the price went on
down because the scarcity of mon
ey and.unrewarded toil (spent on
a decreased crop) conspired to re
duce the producers ability to buy.
So now if we would reach the
desired result by the Cotton Grow
ers Association-raise the price of
cotton; we must not simply stop
the production of the staple, but
we must put the producer at some
kind of work that will enable him
to remain a consumer of cotton, or
if possible, increase his consump
tion of cotton goods. We certain
ly cannot hope to raise the price of
an article by decreasing its pro
duction when that very act decreas
es its consumption in the same ra
tio.
Therefore the labor that is now
employed in the production of cot
ton must be employed at some
thing which will continue it as
a consumer of cotton goods,
if the price is to be raised, or even
maintained by decreasing the pro
duction; but this can be done, and
will form some of the interesting
and profitable themes for discus
sion in the various (anti) Cotton
Growers Associations that should
be formed all over the country.
Supplying the farm or plantation
with food products, keeping
the fences and buildings in good
repair, and the land renovated
and up to its virgin fertility will
require the bulk of the time; while
all surplus might be donated to the
production of such food prodqcts
are in demand by neighboring
towns and cities, and the produc
tion of sugar, rice, tobacco, and
many other things now brought
from a distance.
But we should never lose sight
of strengthening this plan as well
as bringing about permanent relief
by increasing the amount of money
in circulation, and taking the con
trol of it and other great public
necessities out of the hands of
bankers and private corporations,
who will always exercise such im
mense power and special privilege
for private gain, and to public loss.
And this latter can only be accom
plished by healthy political educa
tion that will bring about political
revolution against the platocracy
that now dominates both the old
parties.
Mr. BRuss' plan for temporary re
lief is a good one, and it too must
be brought into operation by edu
cation and co-operation, and we
hope to see the good work of eda
cation on both of these lines go on
at a rapid pace. Our columns are
open to arguments on both sides of
these important questions.
A Cold-Blooded Proposition
"If the government would issue
a billion dollars in 2A per cent
bonds, I think it would be the'
best thing that could happen to
the country."
Such is the gospel of Captain
. J. Lowry, one of the bankers
of the city of Atlanta, Ga.
The indebtedness of the country
is already appalling. Such favor
ed individuals as Captain Lowry t
do not feel it, but ninety-mine out
of every hundred of the men you
meet do feel it. t
Aoording to the lowest esti
mates, the tbtal indebtedness of i
ie the country is $3i).,oNtJ(,000. This
n- includes national, state, county,
)y municipal andt individual debts.
ir The interest charge upon this
i- debt can he shown with approxi
mate accuracy. A fair average
st ulSm it is thought to be (; per cent.
le Therefore, the annual outgo for
at interest, upon the.-sum total of all
), our'debtq, is *$1,5SiN,I , NH N).
as The estimated value of all the
1e property in tho Unionflis $7t,),
)U It is increasing at the rate of 4
' per cent per annum.
of Thereforre the yearly income, to
al be set off against the yearly outgo.
'n is $,3,s Y N.H,t ).
We thus have a surplus of $1.
I o0, ,N01,0(N to our credit.
H But we 'must subtract the cost
e of governingsthe United States,
and of each one of the separate
states andIterritories, and of each
s county, and of each city in the
Union.
d) The cost of governing the Uni
Sted States is $,iN,00,4,,00" per year.
ly So there goes half our surplus
r at one dip.
n Then comes the cost of govern
-. ing each state in the Union. Geor
I gia costs about $2.INNI,(,NM, but
e. New York costs about t44PNo,N), s:
therefore we must strike an aver
e age. Let us say that $10,040,04N0
v. for each of the 44 states is about
of correct.
p That will absorb $44(0,0o4),(,N) of
it our surplus, leaving only $60,0(Io,
te (N0).
il The government of New York
ir city alone, under Democratic rule,
- costs $4),000,(N),.
- Subtract this, and we have $20),
)f 000,0th) left-just about enough
)- to govern Chicago with, if "rigid
economy" does not hit her too hard.
Thus we have exhausted our in
come and we still have some 4,000,
counties to govern, and about-the
same number of cities and large
towns.
s Where is the money to come
' from to meet the shortage I
SWe must-borrow it. Borrow it
I
how?
Issue bonds.
And that's the reason why every 1
state, every city, and nearly every 1
3 county and town is plastered over
with bonds:-the outgo was great
er than the income, and they bor- I
rowed the money to keep going.
1 This mountain of debts keeps
I growing higher and higher.
1 The gap between income and
a outgo widens every year.
a The appalling deficit in the na
b tional treasury, state treasury,
I city treasury and private treasury
grows larger every year.
I The situation challenges the most
profound attention, and the most
patriotic and speedy treatment.
SWhat do the Populists propose i
I Cut downyour expenses, lessen
your outgo, quit wasting millions
on battle ships we don't need, quit
throwing away so many millions
on River and Harbor contractors,
quit prostituting the credit of the
government to speculators and use
it directly for the benefit of all the
people, create more currency so
that prices will rise and our income
increase, give us as much money t
as there was in circulation when
our debts were made, sp that we
can pay them with the same amount
of produce they would have re
quired when the debts were made. d
Thus by cutting down the outgo,
and building up the income, we
can in the course of a few years
make buckle aud tongue meet
again, and all will be well-and in
justice done to no living creature.
But what do the money Kings
want i
More bonds.
When Captain Lowry said he
favored a billion dollars in new
bonds he voiced, doubtless, the se
cretwishes of nine tenths of the
national bankers.
What would be the effect of
these-bonds?
They would retire $1,000,000,
000 of the wealth from taxation,
and thus our income would be cur
tailed.
They would cost us $S25,000,000
per year by way of interest, and
thus our outgo would be increased.
They would intensify the miser
ies of our npresent situation by giv-. de

TO THE PRESS.
State Bureau of Agriculture, )
Baton Rouie, La.-, l)ec. 7, '94. )
it We desire to call your attention
3. to the niiith annual meeting of the
e Louisiana State agricultural Society
h which will take place at Natchito.
e ches on Jannary 23. 24 and 25,
1895.
A large and representative body
of planters and farmers of this
s State is desired at this meeting.
To accomplish this every agricul
tural organization, including plan
ters' associations, farmers' clubs,
t granges and unions are earnestly
requested to send delegates.
The committee on programme
has appealed to the police juries of
t the various parishes to send two
or more planters or farmers as del
f egates from each parish. Favor.
able action of each police jury is
not only most earnestly desired,
but wtll meet with the honest ap
proval of every friend of agricul
ture.
The present financial condition
of our agriculturists calls for "seri
ous thought and deliberation.
Low prices of our staple products,
unreliable labor, soil depletion and
high money rates have deprived
our profession of much of its prof
its and all of its pleasures. Chan
ges in our methods and perhaps
in our crops are imperative, and
what these shall be can be best
determined by the combined wis
doin of assembled conventions of
our leading men. It is therefore
earnestly desired that farmers and
planters from all parts of the State
be present at this meeting and
participate in its deliberations.
The old city of Natchitoches will
extend its usual hospitality, and
the farmers of Cane river will wel
come their brothers from other por
tions ot the State.
Respectfully,
A. V. CARTEB,
Commissioner of Agriculture.
NOT A PASSING CLOUD,
The People's party is not a pass
ing cloud on the political sky. It
is not a transient gust of popular
discontent caused by bad crope or
hard times. It is an uprising of
priciple, and the millions who have
espoused these principles will not
stop until they have become incor
porated into the constitution of
the government and the framework
of society. The people's govern
ment which is to be establisheq
by the People's party will rest on
these two principles: 1. No use
of public powers or public proper
ty for private profit. 2. The
public have the right to use public
powers for the public welfare to
any extent the public demands.
The first principle is a principle of
defense-to keep for the public all
that which belongs to it. The
second principle of progress-to
widen into new benefactions of
wealth and liberty the Government,
which is tbohe most powerful insti,
tution that has made America the
richest country and the Americans
the freest people in the world.
The first principle will put an end
forever to all land grants, charters
to railroads and banks, gifts of
public streets to profit seeking gas,
telephone and street railway syn
dicates, all the gifts of public
poweis and property out of which
the great fortunes of America have
been made. The second principle
will inspire the people to join
their common agent, the Govern
ment, for the common good to any
extent the public will desires.
