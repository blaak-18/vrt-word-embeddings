DESTITUTE 'CONDITION.

Opening of the Rervmafone.
Kansas City. June 22. -Thousands of
people men, women and children arq
camping on the border of the Kiowa,
Apache and C manche reservations in
Oklahoma awaiting the opening of that
land to settlement, are in destitute cir
cumstances, according to Dr. J. J. Mc
Kenna, who has just returned from the
-ene. "Twenty thousand men, wom
en and children massed on the border
and half are entirely destitute," said
Dr. McKenna, "only a small percentage
have even tents to sleep in, but huddle
under the wagons and trees. At least
5000 of them have been there a year
and a half. They went with possibly
$t00 or $300 and have made nothing
since they arrived. Simply waiting,
-waiting. There are hundreds of ders
peradoes on the border who have pick
ed out claims and will not scruple to
kill the successful ones in the drawing,
in case they have a lottery."
CUBAN AFFAIRS.
*naeral Wood's Raport Shows Thit the
Lub&Iln SatLU.1d W.kh Amendment.
Washington, June 22 - Secretary
Root has received a report from Gover
nor General Wood concerning the at
fairs in Cuba, in which the governor
general says tho action of the cou~titu
tlonal cnvention in accepting the Platt
amendment as passed by congress, is
received with general satisfaction
throughout the island. The great diffi
culty which is now contendel with in
Cuba is that relating to commnercial af
fairs, and the necessity of better mark
ets for Cuban products without tariff
restrictions in the United States. Noth
ing can be done, however, until a Cuban
government is formed, when a recipro
city arrangement may be made, but
this will require ratification by the
senate. An order of General Wood re
lating to debts and mortgages, it is un
derstood, will tide over the difficulties
which were feared a short time ago.
Japan.se Minister Stabbed.
- Yokohama, June 22.-Hospi Tura,
who was minister of communications in
the last Ito cabinet, was stabbed here at
a meeting of the city assembly anddied
shortly afterward, Hospi Turrn was
Japanese minister at Washington and
formerly president of the house. The
assassination is supposed to be due to
politics.

this hand now makes ulp to the mantront

has 25 vearlings, 12 colts and 13 fillies,
16i of which were by imtp. St. George,
seven by Prince Ro3 al and one each by

but also make money from the future

In the lcollection of brood tuares at

There is Trophy, the damn of Wad(s

turf and sied among other good ones
the Latonia Derby winner Prince .Mc
Clurg and Whitney's fast sprinter

Mrs. Ferguson is confident of suc

her husband in such speedy animals
bred at the Kingston stud as Helter

George Lee and Dr. Walmsley. Of
these Helter Skelter, with his $21,539

brood mares Is almost an unkno-wn

Mrs. Ferguson is not averse to ap
pearing on the turf as an owner, and it
would surprise no ore should horses be
seen flying her colors within the next
three or four years. If they do. the
colors of the noted turfman Price Mc

A number of people received minor
injuries, but went to their homes. Ten
families occupied flats in the building.
So great was the force of the explosion
that a boy playing in the street half a
block away was lifted from his feet and
hurled against an Iron fence. One of his
legs were broken.
A trolley car was directly in front of
the building when the explosion oc
curred. The burst of flame blown out
into the street scorched the sides of the
car and singed the hair of the passen
gers.
A number of those who were on the
upper floors of the building when the
explosion took place were either stunned
and then burned to death or found es
cape cut off and were suffocated.
Every window seemed to be emitting
flame. Mrs. Williams, her clothing on
fire, leaped from a window to the yard
below and was killed. Her husband, a
cripple, was found burned to a crisp in
his bed.
Some of the occupants of the rooms
dropped from the windows and were
bruised..Others hung from the windows
until the firemen came and 20 persons
were taken down in this way through
fire and smoke by the firemen while
others dropped into life nets.
Captain Allen led with a hose line in
an effort to keep the fire from the upper
floors where it was said many were
penned in. The men had hardly begun
to throw water into the upper floor
when the whole upper part of the build
ing fell. The captain and two of his
men were buried under the debris One
of the men is badly hurt.
The bodies taken out thus far are al.
most unrecognizable.
NO YELLOW FEVER.
Bavana Has Been Clear of the Disease
For the Past Two Mont hs.
Havana, June 22.-Owing to the ab
*ence of yellow fever in this city. Ma
jor Gleason of the marine hospital ser
vice corps has recommended that tie
quarantine be raised on passengers from
Cuba destined to points north of the
southern boundary of Maryland.
There has not been a fresh case of yel
low fever in Havana for nearly two
months and the cases which have occur
red this year have been light. Neither
are there any cases of yellow fever in
any part of the island.
The strongest objection against ad
mitting non-immunes from Cuba comes
from the boards of health of the south
ern states. These boards even object
to the entrance of such persons at New
York, fearing that these passengers
will go south before the lapse of five
days.
Old Relies Discovered.
Burlington, Vt., J. _e 22.-J. G. Fal
con, a diver, has visited the spot where
the schooner Royal Savage, commanded
by General Benedict Arnold, was sunk
in 1776 by the British. He found three
gun carriages and about 30 cannon balls
and shot. Two of the former will be
sent to the Smithesonian Institute at
Washington and the other has been
given to the city of Burlington. The
relics wer discovered in about 3) feet of
water. The carriages are made of wood
and iron, the former being now petri
fied.
Over Half Were Children.
London, June 22.-The war secretary,
Mr. Broderick, informed a questioner
in the house of commons that out of
63,000 persons in the concentration
of South Africa 34,000 were children.
