THIS GIN has been id use for the past

gives a LARGER YIELD OF LINT from

Gin in use, 'he Revolving Head light..
ens the draft and causes the Gin to run
faster with less driving power, thus do
ing a great deal more work within the
same time, while economizing steam or
animal power, than any other Gin. The
seed being ginned very close, the length
of the staple is increased, producing cot
too on this account,of a greater market
valune. This improved value, given by
length of etapl, with ettra prodtetion
of lint, added t increased amount of
work done, more than covers the cost
of the Gin in every 100 bales ginned.

On Frsidaiy morning Mfe s. It. IL

called upon Judge Hill, the Uni.
ted States Cirtuilt Court, at is rooms
in this tnstonm-house, and 1d a long
interview wit hinm relati to tithe
lmatter of the selectiod United

The cotfereince lasted l1 an hour,
and was most agreeable tfooths par.

a'idres.is.sued btheequctitlu i Judge
To the vnoters for Repreditativcs in
Congress, and Electors r rPresident
aitl Vice President of he United
States in the State of L'istaua:
In compliance with the quest atld
order of the Hon. W. 1 Woods, I
have opened the Circuit (burt of tihe
United States, for your StD, for tie
transaction of such busi e as may
come before It under tb Acts of
Congress in relation to F eral elee
tions, and to which these laws alone
apply. The court will lnuain open
until and including the uxt day af
ter the election, to be hid on the
first Tuesday in Novembeijext.
I have fouud no appfatione or
nominations oin file, but lout a con
ference with leading men l ouging to
both political parties, flDu a general
desire that the very best ien of both
parties shall be selectedjand shall
serve as supervisors, an that the
appointments shall be de at an
early day. As I am assi od to the
same duty for my own St -Missis.
bippi-it is impossible f met t ire

To facilitate the app ntment of
supervisors in your State he follow

through the chairman a its etecu

Wolfley, Clerk of the Colt and Chief
Supervisor, the name ofthe person
selected to act for the rty at each
voting place; when agapplication
has been filed by the reiisite aunt
ber of citizens for the ipointment
of such supervisors, thil is for the
city of New Orleans twoeitinens and
for a parish ten citizens.;
,These nominations wl remain on
file for one day subject) objections

AND It NO OBJECTIO$E FILED
the clerk will enter o the minutes

Our the oensuulaien, 4U6 it objctioetr

if possible; by the non tion of an
other person or otherwi ; if not set.
tIed this way, tlid Ch Stipervisot'
will taks the statemen of each and

But from the amicabl eling maui
feated by both parties do not ap
prehend any difficulty Tihe powers

the parishes are difer . Those of
the city are defined in etions 2016,

From the kind maul tations of

That such may be th ase, I feel

Grant's Bayonet Order,
Wansliinton, Aug. 17th.--The Pies
ident's despotic order was the tlicnheme
of conversation and criticism in this
city ti-day. A few members of Con
gress: remain whose apimnionA are
worth quoting. Senator Gordon of
Georgia, wh., started for hone to
night, when asked what he tliodght
would le its effect, said: "I fear it
will be the means of wresting two
SCates from us. Such orders are nev
er issued from philantropic or disin
terestud motives. It certainly was
not intended to strengthen the Deni
ocratic party; therefore we tlust rea
son that its oblject was designed to
effect a contrary result. Not that
there was any fear of violence during
the csrmpaign, but the slightyst pre
text would be aatde an exene for~
calling upon troops, and after that
tales of intimidation and terroini
could be, repeated."
Mr. Morrison, the leader of the
House; said that, after reflection, he
was corivinced the order would result
in great good to the Democratic par
ty in the South. it would put the
people of that section o6i their god
behavior, and doubtless keep them
from rash acts. He did not speak of
the wisdom or policy which prompted
the order, but of its effect now that
it has been promulgated. "I can't
but believe," he coneluded, that the
party and the country will be the
better for Grant's rashness."
Mr. Lamar declined to sxpress any
opinion, but by his looks and actions
it was evident he was exceedingly an
noyed at the attitude of the Admin
istration toward the South.
Congressman Sayler of Ohio laugh
ingly said that it would do the Dem
ocrats quite as much good as it would
the tRepublicans. 'houghtful people
would understatid that one portion of
the country cannot be picketed and
garrisoned by Federal troops on the
order of tile President without giving
the right to scatter the army all over
the country. If in the South, itly
not in the.North t If in New Orleanq,
why not in Cincinnati, Chicago, ol
any other Eity ? Nor would the pec.
pie believe thliat order was maintain
ed through fear. In hLitllsiana the
trouble had not been riots and in
timidation, but the dithonest conduct
of the Stae oficilhds in counting the
vote ; and all tile army of the United
States hlad do terror for such men uas
Packard And Kellogg.
Congressman Meade of New York
regretted the alleged necesslty fbr
such an order. It was intended
that the military should be used to
intimidate the white people of the
South and embolden the carpet bag
gers to lead lawlesa bands or negrnes
to the voting precincts, where dis
turbances would be certain to follow.
sensator Logan is reported as hav
ing said that the prtiudlgation of the
o;der is "the hioist d-n thing that
couild happen to the Republican par
ty..'
The Natchitoches Republican in its
issue of July 29th Indulges in the
following slap-dash article about the
Campte Postmaster :
"Not a week pnsseP that sotte of
our subscribers, from Ward 4, do not
make a complaint that they do not
get their paper. If such is the case,
the fault is not with us, for their pa
per is nmailed regular here and if they
do not get it, the fault is twith the
Postmaster at Camptd. We have
stood these complaints' just long
enough and if there is no way is
which our paper can be delivered at
the post office at Canmpte with assa
rance, we will Ibe comnpelled to report
to the Postmaster General at Wash
fngton,'
Mr. J. V. reedienimnater, the gen
Ilemanly Postmaster of that village,
who is very strict and impartial inl
the discharge of his duty, inquired of
acdc subscriber to the Repiblicids it
his post offBee, mad every one denied
most Ipositiveil of having made any
such "complaint" as that of which the
organ whines.
Mr. Reedhiemmer wrote a letter
containg those facts to the Republicai,
hat not one word of justice to that
gentleman has appeared in the coh
amns of that delectable sheet. That
the Republican's normal condition is I
that of lying or nothtng, every one
knows, and the whole point to this
complaint is, to endeavor to trump up
charges against the present postmaster
at Campte, and have hLnu relorved to
give place to one of the pets of tihe
Bpubicans wtlom the public can set
down as a thief Without farther evl
denee,
Will the Republican be kind eiouglI
to do Mr. Reedbiemmer justice ?

GRiAND I[OTnEL,
f»idianapolls, Aug. 1, 1876.
Dear Sir :-I have just finished a
tour of slx counties in lndiana,
and feeling that any reliable inform
atioL from this State will interest
you, I write:
In the first place the canvass is well
conduo-ced. The people are enthltdsi
i.stic and determined, and the old
war spirit is thoroughly aroused ; and
if it were not for one thin~ we could
rest certain of victory in October.
There is as Independent patDty ihi this
State, confined, it is true, to a few
counties, but fdrmidable, and it will
defeat Gen. Harrison. There is bdt one
way to overcome this movement. The
leaders of the Independents are poor,
needy and in debt. They hiust be
lectuttrd. Let dbcuutints be placed
in their hands that they may be con
vneced of their folly. A bloody shirt
oampaign with money and Indiana is
safe; a financial campaign and no
money and we are heated.
The Natiomi~t Committee has done
nothing for Iidiant. Alone they are
lighting their battles, and bravely,
but sinleds the National Committee
wakes add dqes its duty to you, to
the party and the country, defeat is
certain in October. I never in all
my life felt sd ubrtaln I was doing
my ddty as in thhii contest, and my
desiire for success, my dear sir, is my
unly euse for writing you. Your
rlond;
.f. KILPATRICK.
To R. B. Hayes, Governor, etc.
Drowning imen grasp at straws. So
do Republicans, now that their party
is on ile verge or uerear and pli..ble
ilissolution. We hear constantly the
charge made in republican newspa
pers that the present Congress, in
tie distribution of offices, has favor
ed the Ex-Confederate soldiers in
prelerence to those who fought in the
Federal Army ; in other Wtotds, has
appointed a majority of the poor Lx
Confederates to places at the disposal
of the Ilouse of Ite~piesentatives. This
charge is stale. Nevertheless, it is
stereotyped in most of the Republi
can organ, and will likely emalin so
intil after the campaign is obei. It
is sometimes necessary for the ninety
ninth time to refute an assertion that
is untrue. There were one hundred
and twenty-three persons appointed
to places by the present Democratic
house of Repre~sentatives. Thie Re- I
publican House distributed one hun
ired anid fifty-three appointments.
The list shows that thirty-five of the
present employes of the House are
Ex-Union soldiers1 ten Ex-Confedrate
soldiers, two served in the Mexican
War1 and eleven are colored mnen.
T'ie Republican House had eighteen
Ex-Unton soldiers, six Ex-Confed
erate soldiers, and three eolored men
holding positions. The only differ
ence between the Ex-Confederates ap
pointed by the Democratic House and
those appointed by the Reptublican
ism for thile sake of office;and the
former, reared as Democratesi chose
to remain such. There is about as
much loyalty in the composition of a
Democratic E-Confederate as in the
composition of a Republican exrebel.
WVe think if the scales were lit to a
test thile lwyalty of the former would
mutweigh that of the latter. In bothl
f the two last Congress the bn!k of
the appointments havrd beed distrl
buted among civilians. All were
wade froet Union bemt with the ex- I
eption of those named above. The
Republican party leaders howl be
•ause the Democracy have seen fit to
stake some chlnges But the abofe
staterment is based on statistics, and
mday be relied on.-Engairer.
AT IT A . .N.- The old game of
twindlng in the Registration is be
ing indulged in with the usual fteeb
and elegancee by thile Radical party,
who so greatly desire a "tree and fair
election"--so thley sty
In New Orleans the conduCt of cer

and Hon. Jasper A. Moss; all former
ly prominent in the Republican par
ty, recently nddilossed the people at.
" a Tilden and Hendricks ratification
m meetmig, and there was much en.
Sthitia~n. At a Rejiublican primary
fheld, in one of the Kansas town
ra Delegite threwn by Uothb-sbell
into the radical tamp by declaring
that he was going to vote fbr Tilden
and Hendricks. He used the follow
ing language, which in aeerd with
the viewsof thousands of other hon
est Republicans who do not desire
the prolongation of the rule of a par
ty which has so corrupted and nearly
barkrupted the country :
"I shanl vote for thm'tu`a ~puinb
lien, and without reference to what;:
I may do after that. Butin thiselect
tion I shall vote for it change. t
think the country needs its. And if
you choose to read me out of the par
ty for that you are welcome to do so;
I will give you a list ofa good many
other htrpublicans who are going to
do the same thing, and if you are
going td read them all dut, you bad
better begin the reading odt soon, for
it will keep you busy.to read out all
the Republicans in this townsbip who
are going to tote for Tilden and lien
dricks."
Thie Int'al paper reporting the re
marks of the dissatisfied Republican
fays a discussion of the case followed
and resulted in a decision by the
Chair that a mad might be a Repub.
lican and still vote for Tilden and
Hendrieks for such good reasons as
not to impair hib standing as a Re
publican. And the primary adopted
this declsion as a rule of party disclp.
line by electing the Tilden tman a
Deligate td the Counity Convention.
Ex Senator Ross' paper; the Law=
rence Standard, says the yearning
for a change id 9 strong, and the
leaning of the people toward Tilden
so decided, that the Depublican Statd
Convention evyet refused to adopt
any resolutions lndorsiug HIayes anod
