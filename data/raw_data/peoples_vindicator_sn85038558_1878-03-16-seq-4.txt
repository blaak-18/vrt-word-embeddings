OUR WASHINGTON LETER,.
WASIIsGTON D. C., March "2 17,.
The House or Senate did not hesi
tate yesterday in passing the silver
bill over the veto. Why should they
hesitate ' The subject had been talk- e,
ed over for months in both bodies,
until the reporter shuddered as he en p'
tered on his morning work, and the
wearied Congressman sought in Com- II
mittee rooms and at Sanderson's ref- in
uge from the ceaseless argument.- -
Both Senators and Repiesentatives p1
were ready to vote, and short work p
was made of the veto. I doubt if all s,
the speeches that have been made y
have changed the votes of many mem- s1
bers. The veto drove oneor two men i
over to the silver side, and perhaps, n
on the whole that was more than all o
the previous discussions bad done.- "
The final vote was in the tHouse, 1i0; a
for passing the bill over the veto, and to
7:1 against. In the Senate 4; to 19.- fl
This result has encouraged silver men I
more than the original passage of the E'
bill. Already further financial legis- t,
lation is talked of, and Mr. Buckner b
said yesterday that he believed that s
the bill to repeal the resumption act t,
would pass. I1e did not indicate t
whether he thomght that a more dis- n
taut day would be fixed, or that re
sumption would be allowed to conime
whenever the general prosperity
showed that it ought to come. Anoth
er effort also, will at once be made to f
carry a measure embodying the plin
ciple of free coinage, which was elmi- r
mated from the Bland bill by the Sen I
ate. In truth, the final and irrevoca
ble remonitazation of silver has, in no r
sense settled the uncertainty in Con- r
gress as to financial affairs.
The veto message itself does not i
add any knowledge or argument to <
the side of Ithe question which Mr.
layes has placed himself. It does I
state with force, even the strongest of
the arguments used by Messrs Blayard
and Blaine against the bill. An abler
message could have been culled from
the columns of the New York Heruhld
or Tribune, any day in the past three
months.
A curious story is told to the effect
that Mr. Hayes has a confidential
agent in Cuba, with the double pur
pose of ascertaining the real situation
of affairs between the government
and insurgents, and of inquiring into
the alleged sale, as slaves, in that is
land, of colored men recently kidnap
ped in this country. The agent was
sent away with a good deal of secrecy
as, indeed, was necessary if an agent
was necessary at all. If any such vi
olation of law and human rights has
been committed as the kidnapping
and selling into slavery of American
citizens, there are few who will not
condemn the crime, but citizens gen
erally will be slow to commend the
sending out of individuals, without
authority by law, upon whose report,
if it shall be maliciously false or hon
estly erroneous such grave consequen
ces in politics and to individual rights
must depennd. We should never al
low the office to be conducted as a
detective office is. However, this
country is familiar with extra-consti
tutional methods of government,
through an experience of years under
the rule of the radical party, that we
may expect little stir in relation to
this action of Mr. Hayes. The tink
ling of that "little bell," which, heard
during the civil war, caused the ar
rest of citizens all over tlhe land, has
not ceased; and indeed, we are so ac
customed to it that we hardly express
our natural detestation when we hear
it.
A valuable suggestion was made in
the House yesterday, and will doubt
less be incorporated into future legis
lation. It was that all appropriations
for the Navy be made in debate, and
that it be declared illegal and punish
able to use money except for the ex
press purpose for which it was appro
printed. This would have saved a
great deal of money during Robeson's
time of Secretary, or, at least, would
have compelled him to have used it
for legitamate purposes, to thie great
benefit of the Navy.
There was also reported from the
Naval Committee, a bill appropria
ting $50,000 in aid of Capt. Howgate's
Artic expedition. The Hlouse also
considered for a short time, thie bill
pensioning soldiers of the Mexican
war. Unless a purely political fight
is made over this bill, it is surejto pass
both Houses. ALBION.
It is the Government.
[City Item.]
And in speaking of Gen. lButler's
late speech on thie silver bill the
Graphic says:
"But when he left the solid ground
of history and experience and wan
dered off into speculation, his ingenu
ity got the better of his common sense
and he committed himself to a scheme
which would result to the abolition of
the money of the whole Ipast of the
human race by substituting in place
of the dollar of the Constitution-a
material thing made interchangeably
out of gold or silver-a piece of pa
per printed by the government and
calleda dollar."
Now we do not propose to sustain
any financial scheme or join any po
litical party, but to make apparent
when we can the pitiful fallacies by
which men are carried away. We
have repeatedly, in overhauling the
financial wisdom of our esteemed
neighbor, the Pic., pointed out the
absurdity of rating the silver dollar at
ninety-one cents because sach was its
value while demonetized. The same
raw-boned Rozinante, that has been
in such universal request, is the horse
the knight-errant of the Graphic rides.
The trouble is that these logicians do
not take into consideration, and can
not be made to consider the power,
stability, resources and authority of
the government whose dollat is in
question. Every thing held by the
hard money, or agairst the greenback
contestants, might he true in any oth
or nation.
The first inquiry is whether the
United States are so, commercially or
other wise, dependant on Europe or
any other nation or people as to com
pel us to harmonlze withithem or any
of them, in our money standards. It
is not necessary that a paper dollar
should be exchangeable into gold or
silver, but that it should have the fa
culty of buying in the markets of the
country or thie world everything that
has value. It is not meant that the
paper dollar is to be so hobanged at
acy time into gold or silver, but sim
ply that there is to be gold and silver
behind it. Now, suppose that insteta
of gold or silver there be. . powerful
government behind it that stamps it
as money for all commercial and other
uses among its people and Ithey r
.ivei it as such .
A OMONG C the , AI\tESR
Ralising Irish Potatoes.
Th'le Clinton, La. Democrat publish
es the following tiinmely letter fromn a
practical farmer:
As it will soon Ie time to plant
Irish potatoes, I will give you imy
mode of planting and cultivatiug. As
early in January as the weather will
pIermtit, plow your land deep and
pulverize well. Lay your rows ofi"
say three feet wide, and ridge up as
you would for cotton. Then with a 0
small plow, open the ridge six or eight g
inches deep, throwing a furrow each
way, thus cleaning the same thor
oughly. Lay your potatoes down, at
with eyes up, froni six to eight inches
apart, and cover the same with cot
ton seed that have been killed, from y
four to six inches; and then cover t
with just enough dirt to hide the
teed. When your potatoes are up
to a good stand, bar them off close,
but not so as to interfere with the
seed; plow the dirt back to the po
tatoes, hill up well with the hoc, and
then your crop is made. They will
not need any more work.
I have tried all kinds of manure
cow pen, stable, leaves and wood (
dirt, but I find that cotton seed is
superior to all for Irish potatoes. The
seed keeps them warm and acts very
fast as a fertilizer. Irish potatoes
require damp and cool weather to
make a good crop; therefore it is
very imnportant that they may have "
an opportunity to make before the
dry and hot weather arrives. If there
is very cold weather after the pota
toes come up, it will be necessary to
cover the samue with a small layer of I
dirt, which can be done by running a
plow in the water furrow, they will
F soon come out again.
1 have followed this plan of plant
ing since 1~50, and have failed but
once, and that was in 1355, when we
I had rain from December to the 1st
of Junte.
Handling Colts.
l It is a general practice among
farmers who raise colts to pay little
i or no attention to handliing or break
b ing themn until they are large enough
) to put into harness. It is a long and
- heavy task to master them when they
have been thus neglected. If the
B colt is of a high and nervous temper
' ament, it is often a year a more be
t fore the work is effectually done, and
- perhaps not then, so as to render
s them safe and reliable. Much trou
blt, would be saved and much would
r be added to the value of tile horse in
t greater docility and trustiness, were
tihe work of training to colmmence
e early in life. The horse is eminently
t a domestic animal, and, when kind
, ness is shown him, his attachment to
his master becomes strong and last
- ing. It is very easy to gain the af
5 fection of the young colt. When lihe
understands that you are his friend
I he becomes gentle and docile. Every
s farmer who raises colts should com
mence training them when they are
, young. lie should accustom them to
r be handled and petted, and should
e break them to wear the halter, to
o stand tied with or without the mother.
- If at first they are inclined to be
it fractious, gentleness and firmness
will soon conquer. Care must be ta
5 ken to have the halter easy and seo
- cure, and to tie as first only a little
is while at a time. Tie in such a man
r ner as to prevent their becoming
entangled and thrown. Handle them
n gently, and they will soon learn that
t- you are both friend and master; and
- lyour will-power over them will be
is stronger and more complete at the
d tender age than you can possibly ac
- quire where thie breaking is put off
- to a later period, and is based on
- force. Many fail in their manage
a iment of colts by showing petulance
's and irritability. A rough kick, or
d blow with the hand or whip, given in
it a pet, generally excites the same ir
t ritability in thie colt, and if continued
has a very injurious effect on his dis
e position. Most of the tricks and bad
- habits of our horses are originated
's and confirmed in them by misman
o agement or ill treatment.
11 Another advantage in this early
n training of colts is the greater ease
ht with which they can be taken care of.
ss Wild colts are full of viciousness,
and they usually meet with hard
treatment. When they are broken
to the halter young, they are much
more quiet and gentle, and being
"s brought more under the eye of tihe
re owner, they receive that care and
attention that is necessary to their
Id proper development and training. If
i- the training has been what it ought
1- to be thie trouble of bringing him to
se the work, when the colt has reached
te the age when he can be put into the
of harness, will be greatly lessened, and
re his usefulness and consequent value
ce will be increased. Hence fit your
-a colts for their life's work as you would
Il a child, by early training.
Remedies for Insects,
u David Landreth & Sons, of Phila
Sdelphia, give detailed accounts of
t remediel for some of the bseets which
y prove troublesome or destructive in
e gardens, and more particularly cab
e bages, the substance of which we
cd ondense: 1. The greenish-black
ie jumping beetle, a tenth of an inch
t long, feeding on both cabbages and
t turnips while young, is kept in check
te by dusting with sulphur and plaster,
D or by applying slightly a solution of
se whale.oll, soap or tobacco water.
SSowing thickly and repeatedly may
o secure a crop, or by selecting differ
n ent localities. 2. The insect which
, causes the club-foot in cabbage may
?' be repelled by lime and wood ashes,
fn but a change to fresh land is better.
e 3. Wire worm, cut worms and grub
:k worms may be killed by the slow
b process of ldigging around the injur
ed plant; but thie best way is to give
Sclean land, well cultivated and en
oriched with frequent waterinags to
or stimulate growth, which will insurel
- against undergronnd enemies. 4.
SThe green worms are best cleared
t from cabbage by hand.picking. 5.
ar Plant-lice are driven off by whale
or oil, soap, sulphur, plaster, tobacco
' water,. etc., if applied early, so as
he not to injore the taste of the cabbages.
t As a rule for guarding against insects
he generally, make the ground rich
at keep it clean and mellow, cultivate
Soften and water freely.

er artichokes to hogs fdr upwards of ten
