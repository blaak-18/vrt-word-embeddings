Neuralgia
Pains
Are the result of an
abnormal condition of
the more prominent nerve
branches, caused by con
gestion, irritation, or dis
ease. If you want to re
lieve the pain try Dr. Miles
Anti-Pain Pills. They
often relieve when every
thing else fails. They
leave no disagreeable
after-effects. Just a
pleasurable sense of re
lief. Try them.
“I have neuralgia headache right
over my eyes, and I am really afraid
that my eyes will burst. I also have
neuralgia pain around my heart. I
have been taking Dr. Miles’ Anti-
Pain Pills recently and find they re
lieve these troubles quickly. I seldom
find it necessary to take more than
two tablets for complete relief.”
MRS. KATHERINE BARTON
1117 Valley St, Carthage, Mo.
“I have awful spells of neuralgia
and have doctored a great deal with
out getting much benefit. For the
last two years I have been taking
Dr. Miles’ Anti-Pain Pills and they
always relieve me. I have been so
bad with neuralgia that I sometimes
thought I would go crazy. Sometimes
it is necessary to take two of them,
but never more and thev are sure to
relieve me.” MRS. ' FERRIER,
2434 Lynn St., Lincoln, Neb.

The Hocus Pocus Money Book'*
Published in 1904, showed that existing condi
tions made a commercial panic in the near
future inevitable —and why? Its 200 pages are
filled with incontrovertible economic principles
and astonishing facts, sustained by figures from
the U. S. Comptroller’s Reports, and bank or
gans, proving that the deposit banking system
—as it has been maneged in the past—is the
real cause of every commercial panic ever
known, and most of the periods of business de
pression that have afflicted this country. And,
what is still more important, It shows how their
recurrence can be made impossible- and the de
mand for services and products made to always
equal the supply —without wronging any one, or
costing the people a dollar. Book sellers and
news dealers can not afford to antagonize the
banks by handling this book. Do not blame
them —but send for the book yourself. Terms,
by mall: Single copy, 25 cents, 5 ter |l. Ad
