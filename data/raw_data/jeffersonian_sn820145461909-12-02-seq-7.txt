CHALLENGE, AND THE PEOPLE
ARE CATCHING ON.
“Tom, what do you intend to get
out of your fight on Socialism?”
For one thing, Doctor Wesson, I
expect to get many offensive letters,
a few of which may be as ungentle
manly as yours.
Barring that reward, I expect to
receive the approval of my own con
science, and the commendation of
thousands of good men and women.
Am not opposed to the State So
cialism seen in our public schools, in
our P. O. department, or public
roads. Would like very much to ex
tend this State Socialism to all pub
lic utilities.
“Us old Pops”—the real ones, I
mean—know very well that I have
never changed on land plank or
Referendum; and they know also,
that neither of those planks were
ever held to mean what Dr. Wesson
says they do.
The “Free love” business will be
proved as clearly as a mathematical
demonstration—but I don’t expect to
convince those who wilfully seal their
brains against facts.
“You will have us land in Repub
lican party.”
Readers of the two Jeffersonians
will feel their respect for the Doctor
increase rapidly, after perusing that
sentence.
Have you ever noticed that the
bitterest tongues and pens that try
to wound me and blacken my name
are those of the men who were Pops,
and who left us?
These men, who have changed, are
eternally saying, “Watson has
changed!”
On the same principle, the tipsy
man accuses some one else of being
drunk.

THE CONSTITUTION IS GOOD
ENOUGH TO STAND UPON.
Dear Sir: — I am a very busy
man; too busy to do much canvass
ing for a newspaper or magazine;
but I will undertake to place all sam
ple copies of your publications where
they will do good, and catch a sub
scriber when I can.
I am teaching and trying to run
a small farm, too, and it is a Her
culean task.
I am a native of Alabama, but of
Jefferson county, Georgia, stock, and
am a “dyed-in-the-wool” Green
backer —and believe that no race of
men should have a voice or vote in
the administration of the affairs of
this republic but pure-blooded Cau
casians, well indoctrinated in the
principles of representative Demo
cracy. The Constitution of the Uni
ted States, with its provisions for
amendment (if we, the people, will
watchfully and intelligently live up
to our privileges and duties under it),
is good enough for me. I believe the
Government should do for the whole
people what Individuals can’t do for
themselves and stop there.
Yours for the general welfare,
J. M. PERDUE.

DUCKWORTH HAS NOT AN
SWERED THOSE QUESTIONS.
THEY ARE FAIR QUESTIONS, VI
TALLY IMPORTANT TO FARM
ERS’ UNION. BOYS, MAKE HIM
ANSWER!
HERE COMES ANOTHER ONE!—
SOCIALISTS ON THE JUMP.
Dear Mr. Watson:—Why do you
not cease your desperate efforts to
try to convince yourself that Social
ism is wrong? Any one can read
between the lines of your November
editorial and see that you are only
trying to put off the inevitable—the
day when your brilliant mind must
arrive at the conclusion that Social
ism is the only way out. Mr. Wat
son, your November editorial is an
injustice to yourself. Your prem
ises are as false as your logic. But
I know and understand that you are
only trying to deceive yourself. There
never has been an upward and for
ward movement on earth that has
not had that “free love” accusation
thrust upon it. From Jesus Christ
down to Robert G. Ingersoll, every
prophet has been a shining mark
for the slinging of that handful of
mud.
Mr. Watson, as a critic you are
truly great—but what in the name
of high heaven do you offer us in the
place of the present intolerable sys
tem? I have been a pretty constant
reader of your Magazine since its
inception, and I have yet to find a
single line from your pen indicative
of a remedy.
Come under the banner of Social
ism, where you belong, and let your
mighty voice lead in the van of hu
manity, of progress, of liberty, and
civilization. Socialism means no
such carnival of license as you pic
ture in your November editorial; the
sacredness of the home, the fireside,
the nuptial relation, motherhood and
fatherhood will be truly inviolate,
and not subject to the sport of
chance, as now they are.
Your friend,
ARTHUR KNOLLE.

Answer.
Well, Arthur, it takes a Socialist,
and a very wild one at that, to read
anything “between the lines” of the
chapter mentioned. Any man who
can prove me a Socialist, by that
evidence, is capable of making an
affidavit that Ballinger is innocent,
the Sugar Trust honest, Tammany
Hall pure, and the two old parties a
pair of angels.
Arthur, you need physic. “Some
thin’ er ruther is the matter with
your insides.” Go and show your
tongue to the nearest medicine man.
Yep; the early Christians were ac
cused of practising Free Love, in
those secret meetings which perse
cution compelled them to hold, in the
dark; but Hie Fathers of the Church
did not publish books in which Free
Love is advocated.
THE SOCIALISTS DO!
Robert Ingersoll was besmirched
by malicious misrepresentation, but
I was not one of the mudslingers.
In my estimation, he was a splendid
specimen of manhood; but he made
the fatal mistake of assailing Chris
tianity, rather than clericalism.
Arthur, dear, you have “read after”
me to little purpose if you have net
learned that we Jeffersonians do
offer a perfectly safe and sane
remedy for all the afflictions which
torment the body-politic.
“Back to the old faith, and the old
landmarks of ante-bellum democ
racy!”
THAT, in its last analysis, IS OUR
i J TIC AL CREED.
Just keep on reading those So
cialist exposures, Arthur. You have
been duped. You need to have your
eyes opened.
Why don’t you read the Socialist
magazines and papers which are
published in Chicago and New
York? The “International Socialist
Jeffersonian
Review,” of the former city, pub
lishes articles in favor of Free Love.
(See Lydia Farce’s article in last
number of that organ of Northern
and European Socialism.) The same
doctrine is approved in the New
York Socialist papers.
AND THOSE WHO OUGHT TO
KNOW, CLAIM THAT THE SOCIAL.
ISTS OF THE BIG CITIES PRAC
TISE WHAT THEY PREACH! !

IT HAS BEEN UP-HILL WORK.
Dear Sir: —Many things have
come in my way to prevent me from
working for the circulation of your
literature as I wish. I have
spoken to and written to many of
your admirers and friends, urging
them to work. I have had fears for
a long time that you would be starved
out by the apathy and indifference
of the men whose battles you are
so bravely fighting, as many other
reform editors have been, —notably
Dixon and Lankford.
I know it is very unpopular to
say there are any mistakes or wrong
doing in the church. It’s a pity, but
they are there.
The most unreasonable thing I
have ever read was the attack on
you by the Atlanta Home Mission
Board, when by your expose (by
their own witnesses) of the unscrup
ulous methods of Foreign Missions
you have saved thousands of dollars
to Home Missions. What is this
world coming to? After giving page
after page of space in both Jeffer
sonians, your valuable time and
your superior talent, in defense of
Home Missions, you must now come
down with cold, hard cash or be
classed a hypocrite. The devil has
surely been liberated for a season.
I have not given a nickel to For
eign Missions for eleven years. If
the Atlanta Board don’t correct this
charge against you, then I am ready
to believe and assert that they are
mad because they did not get the
per cent, off your contribution, and,
like you, I will never contribute a
cent through these expensive boards.
I will expose their ungratefulness
and use what influence I have in
preventing the rake-off per cent.
As ever, your friend,
H. M. M’CUSTIAN.

AN INTERESTING LETTER AND
POSTSCRIPT.
My Dear Sir: —I beg to call your
attention to the bills now pending
in Congress, the object of which is to
open up the Court of Claims to
claimants now debarred by the limi
tation of statutes, and, further, the
bills to return to those who paid the
tax imposed on cotton the few years
just after oiir Civil War amounting
to sixty-eight millions of dollars,
which has recently been declared
ILLEGAL and UNCONSTITUTION
AL by the Supreme Court of the
United States.
Trusting you may give the meas
ures your hearty support, and that I
may hear from you concerning it, I
have the honor to be, very respect
fully,
Your obedient servant,
EDWARD C. WADE.
P. S. —I hand you herewith en
closed the editorial page of the Los
Angeles Times of this day, and in-
vite you to a perusal of the article
relative to yourself, not to any con
siderable extent complimentary, but
very much on the order of the
blackguard. Harrison Gray Otis is
at the head, accountable for all the
ruffianism of his audacious paper
and should be handled without
gloves. He is despised and looked
down upon with scorn and contempt
by all parties, political, religious,
civil, and even by his hirelings,
whom he drives and treats as slaves.
It will make you friends and sub
scribers throughout the entire West
if you will come back at him and
show the old rascal, as he should be,
to the world, in all his rascality.

AGAINST THE PROHIBITION
AMENDMENT.
Dear Sir:—l enclose with this let
ter P. O. order for $5.05 to pay for
subscriptions as per list. I regret
very much the smallness of the
amount, and length of time between
my orders, but various causes con
spire to make it impossible, it seems,
for me to have done better.
Most of the people here have gone
wild about prohibition, or rather the
proposed amendment. If I could ex
press my views better in writing, I
would like to say a good deal on this
subject, but as it is I will only say
that from its being at the start a
tolerably harmless looking thing, it
has now proved to be one of the
livest wires, one of the deepest-laid
political schemes to boost the Comer
gang that has come before the peo
ple of this State in a long time.
I, knowing full well the general
nastiness of Alabama politics, did
wish that Mr. Watson would let the
thing alone and have nothing to say
about it, but as he did see fit to do
so, I must say that his usual keen
insight into great and deep ques
tions, and his ever-present sense of
fairness and justice, in my opinion,
led him to take exactly the right
stand, and say about as near as pos
sible the right thing in his editorial
of October 7th.
If the spirit of religious and politi
cal intolerance and insolence did not
exist then, and has become well-nigh
intolerable now (about here, at
least), I shall have to admit I know
nothing about such matters. For in
stance, at the school-house where our
county union met recently, a few
days before said meeting, the op
posers of the amendment had an ap
pointment for speaking a,t night (and
it was chilly, I am told), and they
found the doors closed against them.
The Gadsden Evening Journal gave
the matter publication without say
ing a word of disapproval.
There is not one in a thousand, I
dare say, of my age that has used
less liquor than I have. I’ve favor
ed prohibition, but my judgment
places me with the very few of my
neighbors who oppose the Amend
ment now.
