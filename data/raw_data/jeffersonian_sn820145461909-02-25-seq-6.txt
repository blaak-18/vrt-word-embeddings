STRONG VIEWS OF AN OHIO
POPULIST.
Cincinnati, Feb. 12, 1909.
My Dear Watson: Having devoted
considerable time to the last campaign
for the presidency and, noting how
little the masses look to their own in
dividual advancement in preference to
that of party, my conclusion is that
radical steps must be taken and no
mincing of words, to stir up privilege
and fanaticism. Our cause is just—
we have no apologies to make. To be
fair, is to be just. A conference ought
to be held and a terse statement made*
of fundamental and moral issues. Ju
daism and perverted Christianity
(church and usurped money privilege)
rule this nation. The one controls
the pocket-book, the other the public
conscience; a reign oif greed and
hypocrisy is shaping our policies.
These fetters can be torn asunder.
Ist. The abolition of the National
Bank privilege of issuing bank-notes
furnished to the national banks by
our government at 1-2 of ONE PER
CENT. This privilege should be ac
corded the States, Territories, Coun
ties, Townships, Municipalities or in
corporated Towns 'and Villages, to
carry out public improvements. The
currency thus issued to be under strict
rules and regulations for issue and
redemption.
2. State centralisation of the com
mon schools and the segregation of
the pupils in separate buildings wher
ever practicable. Compulsory educa
tion of all children from the age of
six to fourteen years. Six mornings
a week from 9:15 to 12 o’clock men
tal training. Four afternoons a week
from 2 to 4, physical, manual and do
mestic training. The two remaining
afternoons can be devoted to work or
play, the arts and sciences or religious
training.
3. To open the door to all reforms,
the constitutions in all divisions of
our government from national down
through to village should incorporate
“the initiative, referendum and re
call.”
Stop right here? What? Most
certainly. Yours truly,
R. H. Reemelin.
A PARSON ON THE RAMPAGE.
The following letter from a Sub
scriber gives some details concerning
that pulpit attack on Mr. Watson,
which is the subject of one of the edi
torials this week.
There is hardly a congregation in
this state which does not contain some
of our friends. Therefore, when a
preacher personates us, and misrepre
sents us, he divides his congregation
and hurls his cause. The letter below
proves this.
We trust that Parson Branch will
inform himself more accurately about
Mr. Watson’s position, and will quit
accusing that publican of telling lies.
Mr. Watson 'has followed the Bible
and contended that we should “preach
the Gospel to all the world.” What
is there in that to make Parson Branch
so angry?
Lawrenceville, Ga., Feb. 12, 1909.
Dear Sir: Penned hereon is the
statement published by the News-
Herald concerning the sermon preach-
ed by Rev. C, H. Branch. I happened
to be present when the statement ,of
Mr. Branch was made. He said: “I
have been asked by several, ‘Have
you read that piece of Tom Wats
on’s?’ ” He said that you said
“90 per cent of the money taken for
the foreign missions never reached the
foreign fields,” and that you “told a
bare-faced lie.” He also said that
when the devil got hold of such men
as that and made them tell such lies
he had full control of them. (Prob
ably not these words, but to that ef
fect.) “Haw much do you think Tom
Watson gives for missions?” was an
other bold’statement or question. Al
so, “I know, for I have lived down
there by him.” “It made my blood
boil to read it,” was another. “What
does a man like Tom Watson. want to
tell things for?” After preaching
thus he kneeled to pray and prayed
for forgiveness for such harsh words,
but that they came from his faithful
servant (which I suppose that they
did come from his lips and not from
above). Your admirers who were
present became very much offended
at these words. By the way, I forgot
to tell you he said, “The South was in
a more prosperous condition than
ever before; we raise ground peas
enough to support ns. ”, I suppose he
was referring to the statement of the
N. Y. World in the January number
of the Magazine, but wilfttHy and de
liberately said you did it.
We, your ardent admirers, are look
ing for an article denouncing Mr.
Branch and such false statements as
he uttered. Yours truly,
Subscriber.
A PIONEER REFORMER WRITES
TO MR. BRYAN.
Melmore, 0., Feb. 12, 1909.
Hon. W. J. Bryan.
My Dear Sir: I am in receipt of
yours of the 4th thanking me for past
aid in promotion of Democratic poli
cies, and asking me to give my views
touching the causes of loss or gain
of the Democratic vote at the last
national election. I will say frankly
that, in my opinion, our people do not
feel the need of two political parties
to carry out the policies which one
of them has so carefully, skilfully and
persistently done during its control of
the government for forty years. The
Republicans went into power shout
ing, “Free soil, free speech, free
men!” But no sooner had the party
secured complete control than the cor
morant classes got control of the party
machinery and thus of the govern
ment and in such a sinister way that
the great commoner, Lincoln, de
clared: “I feel more gloom for the
future of my country than, during the
darkest days of the war.” His fears
have been more than realized. Through
legalized privilege the crafty, greedy
few have secured the power of life
and death over the industrial toiling
many. The “Hazzard Circular” in
plain words marked the line of march
for enslaving the workers, “by our
controlling the money.” On this line
the National Bank Act of 1862 was
adopted. The construction measure
of 1866-1868-1873 followed with the
funding acts of 1870 with its devilish
Csl)e 3effersonian
purpose of enthroning an aristocratic
creditor class. Those class laws were
enacted by the votes of both old par
ties. When the only true Democratic
platform in 1876 was the Peter Coop
er. The Tilden, as per dictation from
Woll street, was made “as near like
the Republican as possible.” I re
member, as a member of that conven
tion, the vain attempt of our Tom
Ewings to get a vote for silver, much
less for treasury notes in place of
bank notes. The greatest apostle of
true Democracy and sound political
economy, Jefferson, declared: “Banks
of issue are more dangerous to the
liberties of the people than standing
armies. The issue of currency must
be restored to the Government where
it righteously belongs.” The Jack
son Democrats of 1840 declared:
“Congress has no power to charter
national banks. They are of deadly
hostility to the best interests of the
people, dangers to the liberties of the
people, and calculated to place the
business of the country in the control
of a concentrated monSy power.” In
making the “money question” of par
amount importance, do you think, Mr.
Bryan, those historic Democrats were
mistaken ? Are not their fears an
accomplished fact today? Through
currency control, trusts and monopo
lies control labor and the prices of all
the necessaries of life. And what had
the “Denver Platform” (to which you
refer) or its candidate for President
to say in the late campaign about
bank monopoly —the she wolf and
mother of every trust whelp in exist
ence? Only this, “You must not steal
the depositor’s money.” Why then
should the Plain People rally round
the Democratic standard when it of
fers no relief from the extortions of
this deadly foe, sovereign power in
private hands? Have you not for the
sake of being “Regular” and to save
your party “anatomy” consorted
monopolists . you have yourself de
nounced as unfit for public trust, and
suffered them to gut your platform of
every vestige of Jeffersonian Democ
racy? True the trustful masses have
too long followed party leaders, re
gardless of direction but God has not
left himself without witnesses to the
truth. Men who “would rather be
right than be President,” men who
are not nierp negative fault finders,
but constructive statesmen, armed
with the teachings of history, science
and common sense, when, my dear Mr.
Bryan, you were first elected to Con
gress it was by Greenback or Popu
list votes. As the champion of “green
backs and silver,” we voted for you
in 1896. But in 1960 the “money ques
tion” had ceased to be an issue with
you. In 1904 you were ready to help
crucify your toiling countrymen on a
“cross of gold.” You may not re
member when my last order for the
“'Commoner” was sent you (for 6
months’), I said: “I can not accept
any paper as Democratic that .does
not demand U. S. legal tenders as
against bank notes. If after 6 months
you failed to do this, I shall not wish
the Commoner sent me.” Your Dem
ocratic “artillery” is too much of a
bird shot sort. It will never beat
down the walls erected by the relent
less Money, Power. But you are a
reader and expounder of the Christ-
ian’s Bible. It teaches that Repen
tance is never too late,” nor too soon.
May we not hope that we may all
avail ourselves of our opportunities
ere “night cometh when no man can
work?”- Wishing you the most abun
dant success in doing good, I am sin
cerely your fellow citizen,
John Seitz.
FROM A PROMISING BOY.
Dear Mr. Watson: I am a boy 14
years old, and very small to my age,
but hope to be a great man like you.
I heard you speak in Augusta last
year, and think your speech was
grand. Would like very much to hear
you speak again. Your little friend,
Earle L. Bell.
R. F. D. No. 2, Augusta, Ga.
P. S. —Enclosed with my letter, find
a short poem composed by myself,
which you may publish if you wish.
“WHEN I GET GROWN.”
When I get grown and live by the
sea,
I’m going to college and there learn
to be
A sour school teacher,
Or a Methodist preacher —
For either of them suits me.
When I get grown I’ll then be a
man,
And pack up my trunk just as fast
as I can,
And sail ’cross the water,
With the Squire’s pretty daughter
And buy her a Japanese fan.
And then on a bright and sunny day,
When the sparrows and field-larks are
singing gay,
I’ll sail back home,
’Cross the white sea foam
But keep out of the old Squire’s way.
Earle L. Bell.
SUGGESTION TO PRESIDENT
BARRETT.
Athens, Ga., Jan. 16, 1909.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Editor The Jef
fersonians, Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Sir and Brother: Your
editorial in the weekly of January
14th in which you say what you would
do if you were President C. S. Bar
rett, of the National Farmers Union,
permit me to congratulate you on this
keynote to the present situation. Per
mit me also to say I have advocated
this very move among my neighbors
ever since Mr. Sully was crushed a
few years ago by the Wall street ty
rants, but instead of each member of
the Union sending one dollar, let
them non-union as well as union men,
send twenty-five cents for each bale
made by them last year, whether sold
or still in their hands. In my humble
opinion now is the opportune time
for Ihe cotton growers of the entire
cotton States to assert theirpporerw r er
for their own good as well as for the
entire laboring world. I would to the
God that we, that every man who has
been swindled out of his hard earned
cotton, could see and realize the situ
ation as you see it. I 'hope that broth
er farmers everywhere will awake
themselves on this important ques
tion. Most sincerely yours,
J. E. Bradbury, Jr,
