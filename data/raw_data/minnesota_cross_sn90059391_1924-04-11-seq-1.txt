VOLUME 1, NUMBER 37
THIRD PARTY TO MEET IN ST. PAUL
TWILIGHT’S
THINKLINGS
AMERICA, HOUSE OF
STABILITY
THE SOUL AND EDUCATION
ARE YOU EDUCATED?
AMERICA stands forth a mar
velous structure of stabil
ity after having passed through
in its construction periods of
painful uncertainty.
* * *
It has taken the unyielding
faith, the unselfish labor and the
lives of uncounted heroes to
erect the great Temple of Glory,
the United States of America.
What will you do to preserve it?
* * *
We must not permit the rats
of violence, the moles of dream
land or the leeches of moneyed
privilege, to destroy our House
of Stabliity.
* * *
We will drift back to the chaos
and anarchy of primitive times
if a proper respect for law T is not
re-established over the entire na
tion.
* * *
The selective principle of obe
dience comes from the dark days
of savagery and must never be
permitted even a passing recogni
tion. A law is a law, and as long
as any law remains an the stat
ute books, demands enforcement
and obedience.
* * *
Every champion of lawlessness
in the past has shouted in bitter
denunciation against various
laws, mouthing an easy phrase
personal liberty.
* • *
No person can be the right
kind of dweller in our House of
Stability of he or she cannot
read or write the American lan
guage.
* * *
A bureaucratic government is
anti-American. It makes possi
ble long tenures of office for the
political gangsters who seek
places of trust for personal gain.
The House of Stability was never
intended to be used as a museum
in which to display political
specimens.
IN swinging from one extreme
there Is danger that we swing te
an opposite extreme. That Is
Just what happened as we went from
the cultural aim In education to a
more practical one. There Is evil In
an orer-emphasls of the “bread-and
butter” aim In education. We must
always remember that the human
soul Is of more concern than the hu
man stomach, even as important as
that is. Human beings are not ma
hlnes for Industrial production. In
dustry Is Intended for man’s conven
ience, not man for Industry. Profes
sor James H. Baker says, “Too much
attention to the practical, dwarfs the
powers, limits the horizon, and will
result In the destruction of that spir
it which makes a strong national
character. There Is little need to
urge the practical; the more Immedi
ate and obvious motives constantly
draw men toward It. The refinements
of the soul are at first less inviting;
they are hard to Rain and easy to
lose.”
JUST because a person can
tack a sheepskin on the wall
of his bedroom does not indicate
that he has an education. A
yonnjj man may be able to con
strue Homer, understand Horace
and taste Virgil, yet stand out
conspicuously as an ignoramus.
Herbert Spencer said, “No sound
fabric of wisdom can be woven
out of rotten raw material." And
Hannah More has said, “I call ed
ucation not that which is made
of shreds and patches of useless
arts, but that which inculcates
principles, polishes tastes, regu
lates tempers, cultivates reason,
subdues passions, directs the feel
ing*, habituates to reflection,
trains to self-denials; but more
especially that which refers all
actions, feelings, sentiments,
tastes, and passions to the love
and fear of Hod.”
A mind stuffed with facts and
theories is not necessarily a use
ful mind, any more than a sau
aage-casing stuffed with sawdust
la something good to eat.

BRAINERD. MINX.. April 2. Al
though non-Protestant friends in this
community frequently promi-e inter
esting activities should the Klan e\er
appear, rapid growth < f the Ku Klux
Klan in Brainerd has only been en
couraged by threats.
The fieldman of the Ku Klux Klan
has been invited to leave town so
often that the invitations are becom
ing somewhat monotonous and, ac
cording to a statement he made to
day, he has no intentions of leaving
Brainerd till he gets ready, and not
even then, should a certain group
think he’s been driven out.
Certain business men here in town
were suspected of being Klansmen,
and a boycott immediately went into
action. For a few days things looked
a little dubious, but it wasn’t long
until the Protestants united suffi
ciently to more than overcome the
effects of the boycott.
Recently live fiery crosses appeared
within the city limits, one on each
of the five school grounds of the city
A member of ar un-American organi
zation said, according to several au
ditors, “I’ll blow the brains out of
anyone who sets a cross on fire in
this city.” To say the least, this was
a very friendly remark, yet it doesn’t
trouble anybody hereabouts.
It is alleged that one of the city
officials has expressed himself in
terms that leave no doubt in anyone’s
mind as to his feelings concerning the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. He is
so obviously against the Protestant
organization that little stock is placed
in his malicious utterings.
The Protestant people of this com
munity are uniting for the purpose
of saving the Northwestern hospital
from bankruptcy. In spite of public
denials made by various individuals
who are known to be non-Protestants,
there is an organized effort to re
move the Northwestern hospital from
Brainerd. In that the Northwestern
hospital is recognized as a necessary
institution here, the day of its elim
ination is a long ways off, and it can
be said with emphasis that the North
western hospital will never become
a parochial school.
Dr. Harper and the Rev. Mr. Rains
barger have lectured here at various
times and aoused much enthusiasm
for the Klan. These men of courage
and vision splendidly resented the
need for awakened Protestantism and
have succeeded in reaching many peo
ple with their messages.
Do not think for a single moment
that the Ku Klux Klan is not on an
effective basis here. Each week shows
quite a satisfactory increase in mem
bership, and with the coining of sum
mer, out-of-door meetings will be
held. A public, open air naturaliza
tion ceremony is being planned which
will open the eyes of the people in
this neck of the woods.

Believe Sheldon Americans Put
Over Candidates at Mu
nicipal Polls
SHELDON, lA., April 7.-Rumor
has it that membrs of the Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan polled a heavy
vote in the late municipal election
which resulted in placing in office
men of high caliber and of American
ideals.
Up to the present time there has
been a great deal of bitterness to
ward the Klan in Sheldon, but as
the general public is coining to see
that its activities are working for the
betterment of the entire community,
this spirit is dying out. A boycott
against merchants believed to be af
filiated with the order was started,
but has not resulted in any harm.
The fairgrounds was the scene of
the burning of a fiery cross after the
election results were made known.

Clinic Director Handles
‘Problem Children*Cases
EXAMPLES RECITED
BY DR. L. G. LOWREY
First Step Is to (lain Confidence
of Child Reing Examined,
It Is Said
MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., April 7.
When a “bad boy” fully understands
and admits the real underlying caus
es of his incorrigibility—and when
his parents understand them too he
ceases to be “bad.”
So says Dr. Lawson G. Lowrey, di
recrtor of the child guidance clinic
at the University of Minnesota, which
handles 60 new cases of “problem
children” a month.
“I never yet saw a child who had
nothing on which to build,” Dr. Low
rey said recently, “and that is where
the experience and special training
of members of the clinic are helpful
and sometimes essential. Frequently
two or three boys- possibly members
of the same gang, will show exactly
the same faults and behavior, though
thfe causes may be totally different."
Cures “Problem Children”
The special aim of the clinic is to
cure the “problem children” while
they are young.
The clinic recently moved its of
fices to the partially completed new
library building on the university
campus. In the middle of the big
room where the children are received,
on the till bare cement floor, is a ta
ble piled with children’ books and
magazine. Among them are drawing
books in which the youngsters can
lake out superfluous energy by cre
ating pictures. And they do, too,
from just scribbles to creditable
drawings.
Children as young as three are
brought to the clinic—some by their
fiarents, and some by social agencies,
rnt most by the schools.
Contidencf First Need
“Of course, the main thing is to
gain the child’s confidence and re
move any feeling of antagonism he
may have,” Dr. La>wrey said. “Gen
erally this is not hard. In fact, if
we never had any more trouble with
some of the parents than we do with
their children, our task would be
easy.”
There are four main parts to the
examination: history taking, physi
cal. psychological (to discover the
level of intelligence and special abil
ities and disabilities), and the psy
Hits Ban on Political
Speeches in Schools
MINNEAPOLIS, MINN.. March
29. Action by the board of educa
tion barring political speeches in
public school auditoriums wus op
posed in a resolution passed by
members of the Bancroft Improve
ment association, and tiled with
the board Saturday. Free use of
auditoriums for discussion of all
questions, political and Otherwise,
would afford citizens an opportun
ity to secure an education on pub
lie questions, 11. (!, Malrhow, pres
blent of the association, said
ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA, FRIDAY, APRIL 11, 1924
chiatric (to diicover what the child
thinks, and why).
“Sometimes one session with the
child and one with the parents sur
prise us by their results.” Dr. lowrey
said. “One reason probably is that
everyone oonnect£,i with the case gets
a chance to unload the underlying ir
ritation which he has been keening
to himself, possibly for months.”
Stepfather Teased Him
“A case we had not long ago was
that of a 13-year-old boy. who was
extremely over-active, on the go all
the time, irritable, impertinent, al
ways running away from home and
school. He had a series of petty thefts
to his record, was of average intel
ligence but rather slow in acquiring
knowledge.
“After careful investigation we
found out that he had a stepfather
who was jealous of him, teased him,
and used to call him ‘girl.’ which in
furiated him. He received little af
fection and no supervision.
“We talked things over with the
boy and his family, who simply had
been busy and hadn’t realized. He
then was treated as one of the fam
ily. His over physical activity
promptly subsided, his mental activ
ity increased, he took his proper
place in school and became a normal
healthy boy in a remarkably short
time. •
Unhappy Because Mother Stole
“Jack, also, was 13, but he was the
leader of his gang, and continually
was stealing and making trouble at
school and in the boarding house
where he stayed. He was looked on
as a “tough customer headed for the
penitentiary." He evaded all ques
tions. He insisted he acted that way
because he liked it and was worried
about nothing.
“Finally we traced both his father
and mother. We found he was de
voted to his mother and was very un
happy because she stole and was not
living the kind of life she should.
This gave him an absolute “inferior
ity complex,” which he took out by
trying to be a leader in the only way
he could.
“His lamer was square and a good
citizen, and now the boy is living
with him and doing splendidly."

WASHINGTON, D. C., April 4.
—The immigration fight is on in
dead earnest in congress, and ev
ery Klansman who wants to help
by wiring his senator or congress
man, must do so right now if he
wants to get in before the fight
is over. This is the last call. It
is the eleventh hour.
In the senate the fight has been
on several days. The bill is on the
senate calendar as the unfinished busi
ness of the senate, and comes up ev
ery day the senate is in session. It
began with a long discussion by the
chairman of the senate committee.
Senator Colt, of Rhode Island, who
told of its many provisions. Senator
Colt and the committee substituted
the 191<trcensus on which to base the
quota instead of the IHfIU census iu.
is wanted by the Johnson bill over in
the house. The 1890 census will fur-
ther restrict immigration over that
of 1910 by about a ratio of something
like 150.000 to 180.000 as against 355,-
000 to 40,000, if the 1910 figures are
enacted into law. Klansmen are f«n

a stoppage of immigration altogether
for a five-year period.
Senator Harrison, »>f Mississippi,
has an amendment for which he is
fighting to base the quota <>n the 1890
census, and Senator Short ridge, of
California, is fighting for this amend
ment, providing for Japanese exclu
sion. California people want the Japs
kept out. They have too many of
them on the Pacific coast.
Senator Reed, of Pennsylvania, au

fighting for the senate hill, but he
wants to try to keep the “gentle

ing that it will be more effectual in
the curbing of that immigration than
would any exclusion law. The Cali
fornia senators take issue with him
on that point, and are arguing for
Japanese exclusion altogether.
The bill will not come to a vote in
the senate for possibly another week,
as it is believed it will be under dis

Sob Story Blames
Klan for Stealing
Minneapolis Child
<
MINNEAPOLIS. MINN., March 31.
The news story that appears in to
day’s Minnesota Daily Star refers to
the Ku Klux Klan as a party to the
alleged Tanner persecution is ridic
ulous, for the Protestant organiza
tion does not take part in any such
case as is alleged to be centered on
Zina Tanner.
The news story is clearly one that
reporters class as “sob-stuff” and is
written from a point of view which
attempts to malign the Klan and
Klansmen. It relates that a secret
organization is to blame for the dis
appearance of Alice, aged 6, who was
being reared bv her foster parents,
the Tanners. Efforts made to con
nect the Ku Klux Klan with the dis
appearance of Alice reveal suspicions
that are ill-founded. Alice, it seems,
is the daughter of Mrs. Tanner by a
former husband, one William Ham
mond. who lives in North Dakota.
Mr. Tanner is quoted as saying that
certain persons believe him and his
wife incapable of properly taking
care of Alice and providing good sur
roundings. Further, he is reported to
have expressed himself so as to indi
cate a belief that the persons affili
ated with the Ku Klux Klan desired
to tuke the child away from the in*
iluence of himself and his wife.
The fads so far revealed in connec
tion with the case in no way point to
the Ku Klux Klan as a party to the
disappearance of Alice. Hut then,
the story serves the purpose of The
Ktar, which has always been unfair
in its attitude toward the Protestant
organisation.

NORTH FIELD. MINN., April 2.
Under the title of “The Business of
Kluxing," the editor of The North
field News, Mr. Herman Roe. makes
many statements that reveal him so
completely ignorant of the Ku Klux
Klan as to make him eligible for a
place of honor in the Ananias club.
The people around here have hail
many a good laugh over the edito
rial, and Northfield tailors reported
stampedes which have kept them
busy sewing buttons to ve9t».
