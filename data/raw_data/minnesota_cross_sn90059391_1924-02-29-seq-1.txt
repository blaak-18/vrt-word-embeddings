A CHALLENGE AND
REMINDER
KLANSMEN, THE PROTEST
ANT CHURCHES NEED
YOU
HELPIN'!} THE FARMER
Have you noticed that politi
cians are overly zealous in their
“efforts” to help the farmer,
these days. Do you wonder why
office-seekers are so much con
cerned about the “poor, starving
agriculturist?” There is but one
answer —the politicians think it
is good politics.
* * •
Anyone who has investigated
the financial status of the mid
dle-west farmer, knows that
something is wrong. Political
pow-wows, however, rarely bring
relief.
• • •
The way some word-smashers
tear their hair you’d think that
something constructive is being
seriously attempted for the bet
terment of the rural economic
situation . Beautiful phraseology
and glowing statements of “what
ought to be done” don t seem to
bring anything that is even
worth passing attention.
« * *
Politicians can’t deceive the
farmer very easily any more. He
takes what he reads and hears
with a generous amount of salt,
as never before.
* * *
Some men in public life leave
the impression, whenever they
issue public statements, that the
farmer is begging alms. In spite
of the statements of “those high
in financial circles,” pointing to
“ways and means for the solu
tion of the general condition of
insolvency prevailing in the ag
rc-dtuiral states,” tV is
not a beggar. He merely wants
a square deal, and he s out to get
it.
* • •
The “rampaging of the middle
west farmer” i$ looked upon with
apprehension by those who have
waxed fat on the system which
takes much but gives little.
* • *
The farmer is called a “danger
ous radical when he insists on
a marketing system that assures
to the producer just returns from
investments and labor. Today
the farmer of the middle west
has no more control over market
prices than King Tut. He is
practically compelled to take
what the big gamblers in agricul
tural products offer him.
• * *
IT WILL NOT ALWAYS BE
THUS.
THE STORY OF THE SPECTACLES
One day Lula Johnson brought
home a note from the school nurse
wherein was given a recommendation
that Lula’s eyes he taken care of
Immediately. When Lulu handed the
note to her father she watched him
read the “message.” Suddenly Mr.
Johnson threw the card on the floor
and bitterly promised the nurse a
piece of his mind.
The next day >lr. Johnson went to
the principal’s office and there paid
his respects to the “snooping nurse.’
“Mr. Johnson,” said the principal,
“I want you to look at this matter
from the right angle.”
“I’m not a fool,” retorted the an
fry parent.
“How old Is your daughter! ques

“Lula Is In the third grade, I be

“Yes.”
“She should be in the fifth or sixth

as most children of her axe,” the
principal explained.
“My chll-* Is smart. The whole

came back Mr. Johnson.
“The nurse thinks your daughter

The Minnesota Republican Volun

endorsed Coolidge for president. The
club also endorsed the idea of a state
elimination convention to pick can
didates for the state offices, and
asked the Republican state commit

Later in the same day on which
the Republican Volunteer league held
their meeting, the officers of the
league were invited to come as din

Republican club. They attended, and
friendly relations between the two
organizations were established. It
is said that about 150 attended the
dinner.
Com mends President
The Coolidge resolution, passed by
the Volunteer league, commended
the president for “his statesmanship,
his wisdom, his honesty and his fear
lessness in conducting the affairs of
his high office.” and endorsed his
candidacy for the Republican nomi
nation. The other resolution in
dorsed the convention plan proposed
by Sam Y. Gordon. Under it the con

candidates for each office, and both
would then go on the primary ballot.

president, and James A. Larson, of
Walnut Grove, secretary of the Vol
unteer league, spoke at the dinner
given by the Hennepin County Repub

league has no candidates and seeks
only to re-establish the Republican
party with the voters, who are tired,
he said, of a party organization “tak

Former Mayor J. E. Meyers eulo

Tennessee Klan Holds Many En
thusiastic Meetings—Grows
Rapidly
JACKSON, TENN., Feb. 25. Jack
son, Tennessee, has one of the best
Klaans in the state. Meetings are
held once each week, and every other
week the meeting is open for eligible
men to attend in order to hear the
principles of the Klan discussed.
Last Friday night the editor of
The Tennessee Fiery Cross addressed
the meeting. A large audience heard
for the first time the principles .of
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
from the man whose writings they
had been reading through the col
umns of The Tri-State American
predecessor to The Tennessee Fiery
Cross for the past year.
Much interest was shown through
out the evening, and especially in
that part of the address which ex
pressed a plea for constructive effort
on the part of every Klansman to
build up love and American patriot
ism and get back to the constitution
of the United States and the Chris
tian principles upon w-hich the Klan
is founded.
Mayor of St. Paul Should Answer Some Questions
(By TWILIGHT)
In his Washington day address de
livered at the St. Paul auditorium.
Mayor Nelson attacked the Ku Klux
Klan. He didn’t for unknown rea
sons mention the Klan in so many
words, but his references to the Her
rin, Illinois, affair, left no doubt in
the minds of his auditors what he
was trying to say and what organi
zation he was attempting to malign
by caluminous charges.
It is generally thought by those
who heard the mayor that he was
playing for the vote of that element
which is known to be bitterly op
posed to the great American move
ment. Mayor Nelson may have been
sincere in his oratorical outburst,
hut this is doubted by an unusallv
large number of people that I have
approached.

SALVATION ARMY LEADER DENOUN
PRESENT TREND TOWARD MODERNISM
(By TWILIGHT)
“Modernism’s first havoc-wrecking
blows at the heart of America’s civ
ilization are being struck,” said Col.
Alexander M. Damon, of Chicago, at
dedicatory services held at the Sal
vation Army women’s home and. hos
pital, 1471 West Como avenue, St.
Paul, Minn.
Colonel Damon, as a Salvation
Army worker for 34 years, has pass
ed through experiences that make
him an authority on social questions.
He is also recognized as an able de
fender of fundamentalism against
modernism.
“Modernism,” said Colonel Damon,
“has made the sporting page the
Sunday gospel reading and the golf
club the house of worship.”
“It (modernism) tears down faith
and scoffs at a personal God. It is
not a religion,” he continued. “Mod
ernism is not based on the so-called
discoveries of science. It merely is
the most ancient of cults, older
Christianity, Buddaism or Confucian
ism, a place of refuge for those who
have fallen away from God because
they lack courage to abide by his
law.”
“It would establish a system of
self-privilege as destructive to our
present-day civilzation as it was to
the civilization of centuries long ago.
Founded on Christianity
“America was founded on Chris
tianity. Unless its people soon take
cognizance of this, realizing that the
constitution which is the backbone of
the nation, presuppose fundamental
Christianity and adherence to Chris-
Donations Made to
Two Churches by

STANFORD, ILL., Feb. 25.—At
morning services of the Christian
church here last Sunday, Klansmen
in full uniform marched in just as
services had commenced and pre

used in rebuilding their church
which was destroyed by fire some
time ago.
Their leader offered a prayer and
the Klansmen left as silently as they
came,
At the evening services of the
Presbyterian church, the same date
the same number of Klansmen in
full uniform went and presented an
other SIOO toward the expense of re
decorating the church. The pastor
offered up a prayer and they left as
silently as they came. To say the
gifts were appreciated would be put
ting it mildly.
We are the new crusaders—the
Klan—marching embattled against
’he Saracens of graft, illiteracy and
crooked statecraft.
I have tried to think that the St.
Paul mayor was really different than
the usual run of politicians but by
his own words he has revealed him
self. I have found some people, ob
viously non-Protestant, who thought
that the mayor was friendly in his
views of the Ku Klux Klan and so
expressed themselves as opposed to
him. On questioning these people, I
also found that they had “other rea
sons" for their refusal to support

is very possible that “His Honor” re
ceived various ‘‘messages’’ which
pointed to rumors purporting to
show that Nelson “is friendly to
ward the Ku Klux Klan." and so he,
as It appears, jumped at conclusions
which brought forth the “masterly
oration” filled with sops for the “un

day is depended upon to guide the
entire world back to sanity and or

“Never was crime so flagrant or
plentiful as today. Never has this
nation faced such a series of soul
sickening treasonism as today are
rocking its capital..
“Modernism cannot hope to scope
with this because it fosters it.
"There is a remedy—good old-fas
hioned Christianity. Only the old
time religion can heal the wounds
which have been and are being made.
Man must have a personal God. An
abstract God offers him nothing. Any
fool can tear down, but only God and
those in whom His spirit moves can
build for eternity.
“Good old-fashioned religion was
present at the birth of this country,
but it may not be at its death.”
To some Colonel Damon will ap
pear as a calamity howler, but to the
thinking people there will come a
realization that all is not well with
our beloved country. As I ponder the
statements of the Salvationist, I
can’t help but thank God that the
Ku Klux Klan came forth at the
time it did. All real Klansmen are
doing their utmost to stem the awful
tide of crime, vice, irreligion, lost
vision .The Ku Klux Klan will save
America. Klansmen, look well to
your duty as Christians, Americans.

At the close of counting ballots at

2500 mail sacks of ballots to count
and the first week saw 155 of them

According to the attorney frir Sen

change either way. If anything,
there was a slight gain for the Tex

through the remaining ballots to be
counted Senator Mayfield will have
been elected by more than three to
one over Peddy in the Lone Star
state.
Four counties were counted this
forenoon. Three of them gave Sena

for his opponent. In Brazos county
Mayfield was leading Peddy by more
than four to one. Brooks county

SALVATION ARMY APPEALS TO MINNESOTA
COUNTY SHERIFFS TO AID IN PREVENTING
CAUSES OF IMMORALITY IN GOPHER STATE
WOMEN OF KLAN
TO BE ORGANIZED
IN GOPHER STATE
Experienced Queen Kleagle
Will Start Protestant
Women’s Movement
STARTED IN SMALL WAY
Principles Similar to Those of
Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan
(By PASSERBY)
The state-wide organization of the
Women of the Ku Klux Klan is al
ready under way. The national head
quarters of the women’s organization
has sent to Minnesota an official re
presentative who will have charge of
all organization work of the women’s
branch of the great Protestant move
ment.
The Queen Kleagle now in the
state comes well recommended. She
built a wonderfully effective organi
zation in an eastern city and is well
versed in the best methods used in
building an organization such as the
Women of the Ku Klux Klan. We are
at liberty to state that the Queen
Kleagle for the Realm of Minnesota
is a minister’s wife. She brings with
her to assist in the great work ahead,
her talented and charming daughter.
Although the women’s organization
is not a part of the Ku Klux Klan.
the two have much in common. The
Protestant women of this state have
been awaiting the opportunity which
is now theirs. Over the state are
tens of thousands of Protestant wom
en who seek to serve on as an effec
tive basis as the Protestant men who
are members oft the Ku Klox Klan.
Heretofore in Minnesota, the Pro
testant women have had to organize
without any assistance from the na
tional headquarters of the women’s
organization. Considering the handi
caps under which they have labored
the women of the Gopher state arc
to he complimented for their suc
cess, thus far attained. We know
that the women of this state will
respond nearly immediately to the
call of Americanism and J’rotestan
ism.
The Women of the Ku Klux Klan
is of women, by women and for wom
en. It is the only women’s organi
zation recognized by the Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan. The Women of
the Ku Klux Klan believe in:
The tenets of the Christian reli
gion; white supremacy; protection
of pure American womanhood; closer
relationship between capital and la
bor; preventing unwarranted strikes
by foreign labor agitators; upholding
the constitution of the United States
of America; the promotion of pure
Americanism; limitation of foreign
immigration; education for worthy
American ctizenship; protection of
the weak and innocent; defense of
the helpless; relief of the injured
and oppressed the suffering and un
fortunates; freedom of speech and
press; public education, and separa
tion of church and state.
AH native-born, white, gentile,
Protestant women are eligible for
membership in the Women of the Ku
Klux Klan. All those interested may
get information by writing to the of
fice of The Fiery Cross, St, Paul,
Minnesota.
State prohibition agents recently
raided the plant of the Joy Products
Company at Columbus, 0., arrested a
number of persons said to have been

and ordered the brewery closed. The
agents said beer of 4 per cent alco
holic content was found in six bis?
vats, and samples of the liquor werd
taken.
Who hates the Ku Klux Klan? Do
you know, Mr. Nelson. Let me tell
you. Every criminal, every gambler,
every thug, every libertine, every
girl ruiner, every wife beater, every
dope peddler, every moonshiner, ev
ery shyster lawyer, every white slav
er is fighting the Ku Klux Klan.
In your heart, Mr. Nelson, you
think the Ku Klux Klan a mighty
fine organization. I honestly believe,
hut political victory has gone to j’our
head. Are you “shooting your hot
stuff” for the benefit of the Roman
Catholic vote? If you are, you are
wasting your efforts. Mr. Nelson,
make a few investigations nnd you
will soon learn that it doesn’t pay to
make political moves that are ob

ST. PAUL ANNIVERSARY
TO BE HELD MARCH 4
City Has Grown Wonderfully
Since It Awoke to Its
Possibilities
The seventieth anniversary of the
incorporation of St. Paul as a city by
the Minnesota territorial legislature
will be celebrated March 4 and, It is
said, will mark the beginning of a
new industrial development. It took
St. Paul 67 years to collect 234,000
inhabitants; in the last three, it has
added approximately 65,000.
Citizens point to the city’s break
ing through the shell of tradition
that has limited it to the ways and
dimensions of “a big country town,”
and rapidly attaining the metropoli
tan dignity, becoming the capital of
the state of Minnesota. There is noth
ing new in the many possibilities of
development; they have been pres
ent for many years. But that these
possibilities nave been discovered by
the people who have overlooked them
for decades is fundamentally novel.
It will be as much the realization of
this awakening as the anniverrsary
itself which will be celebrated in
March.
The common opinion among those
who prefer a reason for such phe
nomena is that the community just
now is feeling the first real fruits of
prohibition. Prohibition is doing re
markable work, according to socio
logists. At the present rate of
growth the ixipulation mark of 750,-
000 set by the city’s leading enthus
iasts is not as far distant as 300,000
was 70 years ago.
That the public are behind this
growth is illustrated well by the fact
that in less than two years $16,500,-
000 in bonds has been voted for the
extension of schools, roads and other
improvements, and the people now
are talking additional bond issues.
How unusually this is can be readily
perceived when it is explained that
only a few administrations ago tax
payers were shocked because they
were asked to authorize a $25,0041
bond issue.
St. Paul has traveled a great dis
tance since the “Chapel of St. Paul,”
from which it derived its name, was
built and consecrated; it has gained
much since the town site was sur
veyed, platted and recorded, but
what many of its citizens of the
present consider most significant ac
complishments are recorded within
the last three years.
In spirit the Ku Klux Klan calls
upon its members to surrender self
for the good of the nation —to work
hand in hand, as all loyal bodies,
with the government. It hopes that
we ail. as good citizens, shall seek
to subordinate our personal wishes
to the needs and demands of the
country as a whole.
son, where do you stand in the “soli

The investigators of the Minneso
ta Fiery Cross are working night and
day to get facts pertaining to your

officials of the Gopher state. I defy
you to publically and honestly an
swer tlie following questions:
Is the police department given or

whoever they may be?
Have policemen ever been “called
on Ihe carpet” for doing their duty?
Did a policeman ever, during your

‘wasn’t wanted?”

“Petting Parties” and Joy-

crease, Is Charge
“Petting parties” and joy-rid
ing are causing an alarming in
crease in immorality throughout
Minnesota, and “most drastic ac
tion" is needed to improve con
ditions. Colonel William S. Bar
ker, divisional commander of the
Salvation Army, said a few days
ago in an appeal to Sheriff Earle
Brown of Hennepin county and
Sheriff John Wagener of Ramsej
county.
In his appeal to county sher
iffs, Colonel Barker asks official
assistance in preventing the
spread of juvenile delinquency ia
this state, citing “a deplorable
increase in the number of insane,
feeble-minded, diseased and
criminally inclined persons,” and
holds that one result is “ a pro
portionate increase in tax rates."
The appeal to Minnesota sheriffs
was made in the form of a letter.
The letter reads as follows:
“The Salvation Army needs your
help.
“One of the most serious problems
confronting Minnesota is tne com
bating of immorality, illegitimacy,
and other resultant evils which bring
a deplorable annual increase in the
number of insane, feeble-minded,
diseased and criminally inclined hu
man beings and a proportionate in
crease in the tax rate.
Illegitimate Cases Increasing
“So great has been the increase in
illegitimacy cases in the last several
years that the Salvation Army has
found it necessary to build an addi
tion to its women’s home and mater
nity hospital, and aid in providing
proper physical, mental and moral
care for unfortunate girls. This ad
dition will be ready for occupancy
soon.
“Investigation over a period of 24
months reveals that in a surprising
ly great number of instances 'joy
riding’ and ‘auto petting partied
have been responsible for the plight
of those admitted to the home. Some
of these girl-mothers tell stories of
having been the unwilling victims of
automobile drivers from whom they
accepted ‘lifts,’ but in all too many
cases the girls’ own love of motor
car pleasure trips must be blamed.
“To the end that 1924 may see a
reduction, instead of an increase, in
the number of unmarried mothers in
Minnesota, the Salvation Army urge**
that you take most drastic steps ta
curb automobile joy-riding, pa/kang
without 1 ights and petting parties i>
your county,”
In an interview at the women’s
home and hospital in St. Paul, it was
said by Commandant Julia Thomas,
superintendent, that the increase in
illegitimacy “is but one phase of *
serious situation.”
Results of Moral Laxity
