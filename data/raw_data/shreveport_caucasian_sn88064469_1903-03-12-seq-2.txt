The Lighter
Side of
Washington
Life ."
[Special Correspondence.]
Washington, March 2. - President
Roosevelt attended the recent wedding
of the daughter of Senator Cockrell of
Missouri, which was an unusually bril
liant and enjoyable affair. Among the
guests was Hon. John W. Foster, the
well known American diplomat and
former secretary of state, whom the
president has selected to look after the
interests of the
United States in
the negotiations
under the lately
ratified Hay -
Herbert Alaskan
treaty.
The president
was in particu
larly fine fettle
and had more
fun than a
schoolboy on a
lark. He ram
bled around
among the guests
at the breakfast,
told the girls
how pretty they
were, shook
hands with and
com plimented
the matrons and
doubtless would
have kissed the
babies had there
been any pres
ent. Despite all
THE sALAD SLID OFF hi s merriment
THE PLATE. the president
was inadvertently the cause of a palpa
ble disaster.
During the serving of the wedding
breakfast Mrs. Foster asked her hus
band to get her some salad. Mr. Fos
ter went to the table and procured a
plate of salad and a cup of clam bouil
Ion., Just as he was about to hand the
salad to Mrs. Foster the president
came up and asked the diplomat some
question about the Alaskan boundary.
Mr. Foster very justly prides himself
on his knowledge of the conditions and
status of Alaska and began an earnest
dissertation on that subject, giving
emphasis by rather animated gesticu
lations. The result was that the salad
slid gracefully off the plate and landed
full on the front breadth of Mrs. Fos
ter's magnificent drwss.
The discussionof the Alaskan bound
ary question came to an abrupt end,
Mr. Foster having more serious things
to engross his immediate attention.
Representative Hamilton of Michi
gun had for his guest the other day
a Tax Commissioner Mc
Saith's Laughlin of the Wol
iverene State.
E.Xclusve "I suppose you will
reroýa t ive tke me to the White
-----c9 House," asked Mr. Mc
McLanghlin. Mr. Hamilton affected
great surprise that such a request
should be made of him.
"Good heavens, no!" he said. "I can't
do that."
"But why?' asked McLaughlin. "I
am usually takep there when I come
to Washington."
"Yes, yes, I know," Hamilton an
swered. "but, you see, I am the Michi
gan member of the Congressional
union."
"I don't understand," faltered "Mc
Laughlin.
"Well, rIf tell you. If I took you to
the White House I would be fired out
of the union, for we recognize thai
William Alden Smith of Grand Rapids
has the exclusive prerogative of taking
Michigan men to see the president."
Since President Roosevelt's "race
sualcle" letter deploring the lack of
children in American families was
printed he has been overwhelmed with
letters of congratulation from all over
the coantry. The moet convincing ex
hibit came from Bueyrus, 0., in the
shape of a photograph. It showed a
sturdy map. gd his equally sturdy
wifeP surroduded by twelve children, all
theirs. Beneath the picture was writ
ten the simple legend:
.."Not guilty."'
Representatfive' Fordney of Michigan,
who enjoys the reputation of being a
wit, was the other day arguing earnest
ly in behalf of American registry for
the good ship Mira, which has been
smashed on the reeks off the coast of
Nova Scotia. Tbeie was opposition on
the pagt of some of his colleagues, and
that made Mr. Fordney even more ear
nest na-bhis argament. He reached a
teverish -eeomparpron as to the objee
tions raised and the benefits that would
accrue.
"Why, Mr. Speaker," said he, "the
objectlops raised here to the passage of
this-dbill don't amount to a fly track on
the map of the world."
A latug 'ient around the mahogany
desks,_and Mr. Fordney's bill passed
within whoop.
Even the man with the "political
pall" has his woes, as indicated by the
story told by a dejected
i. 2Iowa politician to a
group of correspond
ents.
.This ppolitfc game is
uno at it's craicked up to be;- he said.
"n to wp. There was ajyouEib
r 'stafiewAi went t the
so le d Qewo- ad
of his ou" . ehurms back in the home town
14 Iowa wrote to me and asked me to
get to work. I hustled around and got
him a job as consul-got it by my own
efforts and through my own pull.
"The news was carried to the home
paper, and each one of those six men
wrote to the sick man and told him
that the job was secured through his
own personal influenceand efforts. Then
it came out that the chap couldn't take
the job because the place isn't far
enough above tidewater.
"Thereupon," said the Iowa man as
he savagely bit the end off a cigar.
"each of the six friends back home
wrote to me. giving me ballywhack be
cause the fellow wouldn't take the job
they had individually secured for him."
The seats of Senator Cullom of Illi
nois and Senator Quay of Pennsylva
nia are side by side in
Mthe senate, and, though
they frequently differ
Office Boy as to the course legis
* lation should take, the
two are on the best of terms. The oth
er day, when Senator Beveridge of In
diana was delivering one of his ha
rangues against Quay'& statehood bill
and the Pennsylvanian was trying hard
not to let it ruffle him, Cullom asked in
reminiscent mood:
"Quay, do you remember McDonald
of Indiana? He used to occupy the
seat you now have right beside me."
Quay said that he did, with a show
of impatience which did not disturb
the Illinois senator in the least.
"Well, what I was going to tell you
about was that once, twenty years ago.
he told me he had an office boy who in
sisted on studying law in his office and
who he believed had the material in
him to make one of the leaders in his
state and whose name would some time
become famous."
Quay shiowed still more impatience
at the Illinois senator's reminiscehces
and the speech of Beveridge, and burst
out with, "Suppose he did, what has
that got to do with statehood and the
present tangle I am in?"
"Oh, nothing," said Cullom, "only
that's his office boy speaking over there
now," he said as he directed his index
finger toward Senator Beveridge.
In the course of an earnest and pa
thetic plea for a pension for one of his
constituents Representative Shattuc of
Ohio said:
"Mr. Speaker, this man is totally
blind. He is dependent on what the
government gives him for sustenance.
His sight is gone, and I recall that one
day he came and saw me"
Shattuc was for a time at a loss to
understand why his colleagues were
moved to mirth over so serious a mat
ter.
When Senator Depew was well un
der way the other day with his anti
statehood speech, he encountered Sen
ator Bate, who went off on an extend
ed discussion of some topic suggested
by what the New Yorker hjd said. Mr.
Depew waited and waited and at last
sat down..
"The president of the.New York Cen
tral," suggested 'a facetious senator in
an undertone, which was, nevertheless,
audible all around, "has run into a
dark tunnel." t
Apropos of Senator Hanna's recent
indisposition, resulting from an un
usually severe attack
Didn't of his old enemy, the
Wan Hs rheumatism, this story
is- told:
Legs In the last presiden
Stial campaign Senator
Hanna had been elected chairman of
the national committee, but on account
of frequent attacks of rheumatism he
was talking about turning the work of
the canvass over to some one else.
These reports reached President Mc
Kinley and he sent for his old friend.
"What's this I hear, Mark, about
your not going tb have active charge
of the campaign ?" he asked.
"Well," replied the senator, "I have
been thinking about it on account of
my health."
"Tell me what is the matter with
you," said the president.
Senator Hanna then told the presi
dent that the rheumatism in his leg
gave him a great deal of trouble, made
it rather hard for him to get about and
perhaps interfered with his efficiency
as a campaign manager.
"Well, Mark," said McKinley, with
the faintest suggestion of a smile, "I
don't want your legs in this campaign."
That ended the discussion, and Sena
tor Hanna remained at the helm to the
end of the campaign.
Among the callers at the White
House the other day were a New York
woman and her
daughter, aged
seven. The pres
Ident received
them cordially,
ahd, following
the introduction,
the little girl
asked:
"Mr. Presi
dent, do you sit
on a thorn?"
"What is that,
my child? 1
don't think I un
derstand you."
"I mean, do
you sit on a
thorn ?"
The little girl's
mother,-with vis
ible embarrass
ment, explained:
"I think she
means to ask
you if you sit
on a throne."
