'' Agriculture.
Uuder the profound conviction
that theie is no subject of such vi
tal importance to our people as that
of Agriculture, we have concluded,
during the brief editorial carecr
( which we begiu to believe we have
imprndently undertaken during the
absence of our friend, the Editor,)
to devote a department of the Cau
casian to its discussion. To our
readers who may think it uninter
esting, because old and trite, we
will sajr that while agriculture is
the Oldest of the arts, it is the
yonngent of the sciences.
It resembles those mines whose
overteemiug treasure crops out up
on the surface and the world has
been too busy gathering it, to dig
into the deeper veins of richer
wealth. But now almost every
question within its vast variety,
although coeval with civilization
coiues up auew with the frcslmeKs
of novelty ; and we ponder over
them with the same intense inter
est, that we listen to the wonderfnl
stories of the spectroscope, when it
tells us of the old familiar face of
our sun, of what it is made ; of its
bright clouds of metalic vapor and
its still brighter rain drops of mol
iron.
It is almost within the last twen
years that science has loosened the
fetters of Agriculture from the tread
miil of ignorance and claimed for it
that dignity and learning and beau
ty which God gave it in the garden
of Paradise. Wo are now told with
an assurance truly startling, that
our plowing which lias persued
its unvarying round upon our old
treadmill for over 3000 years and
which the world thought settled —
is all wrong; and when we plow,
and how to plow, and what manner
of instrument to plow with,, arc
questions as interesting as tliey
were iu the day of Job. Nor has
the inquiry stopped here. What,
crops shall we plant ! Plow shall
we plant f How shall we cultivate ?
How shall we arrange our teams 1
Shall we fence our stock or our
fields ! and a hundred other kin
dred questions are now eagerly
asked and discusse 1 and we trust
will prove as interesting to out
readers as they are important to
their interest.
We can the more readily accept
them as of new aud unsettled be
cause the last eight years of
failure, ought to convince us that
we have nothing to hope from our
present system of crops, of farming
and fencing and especially our ex
cessive demand for manual labor.
Eight years of trial ought to make
us willing to review each and all
of these subjects and rejoice that
there is a philosophy which can re
luodle aud reform the whole and
make them what it is making im
poverished agricultural systems of
other countries schools of learning
aud mines of wealth.
Plowing;.
Perhaps the greatest obstacle to
successful farming in the South is
its excessive demand of manual la
bor. The responsibility for this
excessive demand is about equally
divided between the character of
our crop and our modo of cultiva
tlon. We mean by cultivation not
oflly t)»e working of the crop afterll"
it« planted, bnt the preparation!"'
of the land before planting
It is the mode of cultivation as
thus detiued, that wo purpose to
make the subject of this article.-—
How then shall we cultivate so as
io Lassen this expeusive demand up
on manual labor.
The flrst great Step in this direc
tion evidently was the introduction
of the plow. Its great merit is, as
a means by which » irnal is substi
ted for manual labor, or in modern
phraseology, as a labor saving ma
chine, and'its merits have ever been
Wea8iired by the extent to which
this has been carried. In the ag
ricultural woild, it still remains the
ouly out look iu that direc
tion, and in this age of me
chanical wonders the world is
wore eagerly inquiring, than ever,
wbat is the limit to which the plow
may be made a labor saviug ma
ehiue f This limit depends upon
two condition*! namely ; The tl.or
oughness with which the plowing
is executed and the means by which
it is executed. Our limits compels
us to reserve the latter topic for a
future occasion.
Thoroughness depends on some
thing more than the manner in
which the plowing is done. The
time when, is as important as the
manner. There are some things in
plowing which the plow cannot
complété. The more elaborate part
must be lett to the chemical action
of the atmosphere and the rains ;
to processes which cau be carried
on only in the great labratory of
nature. The paramount object of
plowing is to expose the soil to the
fertilize.ngagency of the atmosphere
and the rains and while these are
Hiding to its fertility, they accom
plish the pulverization which the
plow left half complete. To ac
complish this time is an indispen
sible requisite. The time when, has
another important eleineut, and for
the purpose of lessening the de
mand of manual labor perhaps more
important than the consideration,
we have just mentioned.
When done before the seed of the
weeds and grasses which infest our
crops, have matured, we are freed
from the labor of exterminating
them in the Spring aud Su, U
following. ibis would leave us
nothing to do but what is strictly
cultivation and not grass killing.—
How large a share of manual labor
now required in making a crop is
expended in this latter employment
can be estimated only by one who
is familiar with our system of farm
ing.
But all this is not the only saving
of manual labor involved in the
time when. In turning under the
green crops of the Fall and Summer
to destroy their noxious seed we
will have accomplished for ourselves
a greater good. The green crop
which is usual upon our alluvial
bottom in the fall is worth a fertil
izer from 10 to 15 dollars per acre.
Fertilizers are as indispeusible to
successful farming as plowing and
the manual labor required to des
tribute an amount of manure equal
to that furnished by the green
crops of the fall would be ten times
greater than the manual labor
which attended the plow. The
time when; then, saves us the labor
of eradicating from our crop
our
the spring the weeds and grass
which would be produced from
their seed ripined in the fall. It
spreads upon our fields the manure
which would have required ten
times the manual labor, and expo
ses our soil for months before plan
ting to the chemical and fertilizing
eliects of the rains aud the atmos
phere. This brings us to our next
subject ; the manner or thorough
ness of execution.
Perhaps the most intelligent
means of conveying our idea of
tlhoronghness of execution is to de
tail the time and manner of doing
it. We would begin by turning un
der the green crops ou the land
in the fall, which would bo about
the middle of September or 1st of
October. This would not reqiure
a depth with a turning plow of
more than H inches. About the
middle of September we would sub
soil to the depth ol 10 or 18 inches.
In December we would with si turn

weather permitted in January we
would either reverse the bed*with
a turning; plow „r plow the!their
entire depth, with a gang ofcnlti
vators very much resembling sub
soilers, and on the eves of planting
reverse them again with a turning '
plow. When the crop was up suf
ficiently to wo;k—we would work
it the entire depths of the beds
with our gang ot cultivators with
1
surface plows attached on the
helves so as to work the entire sur
face in any manner desired. IFe
imagine that land thus thoroughly
prepared and planted aud worked
out would require but little manual
labor besides the plowman. Thisj*
much as to the
exécution and it

be accomplished which we must de
fer for our next issue.

The Rust Proof, Red Oat.
"While at Evergreen last Septem
ber, we heard of several planters
who had made forty bushels of
these oats to the acre. Since then
we have conversed with a gentle
man from that neighborhood who
said that he made last year fifty
bushels per acre. Upon inquiring
whether the seed would deteriorate,
he replied his crop was from his
second or third crop, aud ho had
detected no deterioration. We
know the gentleman refered to to
be entirely reliable. In one of
the Agricultural Journals we learn
that a planter on thin land
which had been manured by a crop
of pea vines, made of the same
kind of oats 2,1 bushels per acre
Such crops are doubly as remuner
ative as either Cotton oi Sugar or
Corn. These oats can be planted
from September to the middle of
December, and it would not be dif
ficult for one hand to plant one
hundred acres. Two reapers would
readily cut them in eight or ten
days, and five hands would load
aud haul in the entire crop in two
weeks.
The threshing could be done at
leisure during the Summer, and
,„«r|Witli a thresher wbicli any o„ C with,
.the least skill can make Think of
4 or 5000 bushels ot oat by a single
hand, or even 2500. We see from
the Agricultural Journals constant

said of these oats. They never |
rust, and ripen three weeks earlier I
than the common oats. The same i
ground planted in the middle ofi^
July, would bring from 3 to 4 tons
of Pea Ilay, worth on the ground
$15.00 per ton, and in town $20.00.
When will our farmers learn that
there are other ways ol mak
ing money besides loosing it in
planting Cotton or Sugar.
