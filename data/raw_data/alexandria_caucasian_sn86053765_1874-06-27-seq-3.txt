We were very much surprised lost
week to learn that eighty stand of U.
8. arms, had been brought up on the
Maria Louise, and landed in Grant
«arish for the use of the negroes.
Fe now hear il stated that the negro
witnesses for the prosecution in the
trial of the Colfax prisoners were or
ganized, by the Governor, into a mal
itia comprnr; officers appointed, and
arms furnished, etc. ïliia is precise
ly what was done three years ago—
and which was the beginning of the
difficulties, which eliminated in the
fight at Colfax. In 1871 under the
pretext of organizing the militia—
eighty or ninety stand of U. S. arms,
and uniforms, were sent up; tbe ne
gro Ward commissioned as Captain
and a regular military rejeroc inaug
urated and maintained for three
months. The negroes or most of
tbem, were induccd by fraud and
flattery to join the company and af
ter having joined, were treated as
deserters if they attempted to leave
A regular military can p waB estab
lished, sentinels posted; pickets
thrown out; stock and corn tnken
from tfte negroes, under impressment
for military purposes, and all the
panopoly and pomp of war establish
ed in tho midst of peace. The writ»
of the Court wero treated with con
tempt and in one instnnco six mules,
five hundred barrels of corn and two
yoke of oxeu which had been seques
tered for rent duo by W. B. 1'hillips,
were taken by this military from the
Sheriff and delivered up to that pro
tegeof the govornment. All this prop
erty was carried off by Phillips under
this military protection, and sold in
New Orleans. Phillips and a few
tnoro kindred spirits were the boon
Companions and advisers of Ward
and spent their united strength in
instilling into the minds of the ne
groes, hatred and jealousy, to the
white people ; and teaching them
to construe every look, word and ac
tion of a white man that could pos
sibly bear such a construction; into
I an insult, and to bo on the alert to
resent it.
a
9 In one instance, one of these, ne
groes culled upon n prominent mem
ber of tho bar, to know what ho
meant, by calling his race, negroes—
in an argument which he had that
morning made before tho Court. In
this dangerous stato çf affairs, per
sonal di'tliculties were almost unavoid
able, and whenever one occured, nn
armed mob- of negroes immediately
joined their representalive, and in
moro than^ne instance, the white
man had to lieo to save His life. This
military rejemo began in August.
Dining tho Christmas holiday?, a
"»quad of this company undertook to
„arrest, and carry beforo tho negro s
trap, Ward, two white men. Ono af
ter being ca.iried about, a mile and a
o half refused to go any farther, and 1
Was killed, and his body was found
in the road next day pierced by half
a dozen balls, and bayonet thrusts,
Tho other man was carried to Capt
Word and confined under military
guard and all access to him prohibi
ted, No citizen was ever able to see
him, or to hear his testimony. Nor
lias it been known what becamo of
him. It is moro than probable, that
Ward had him murdered by a Court
Martial, as dead inen tell no tales.
No effort waa made by this negio
government at Colfax, either to'ar
s rest the murderers of tho first man
or to investigate the facts, or to ro
lease the poor man, who was bound
and kept in fetters by Captain Ward.
Of course it would have been disloy
al to the United States government
to inquiro into the conduct of Capt.
\Vard in tho matte/# In tho mean*
time remonstrance after remon
strance had been made, by tho citi
zens of Grant, and by tho members
of the bar in Itapidcs, who were at
tending Court at Colfax, to the Gov
ernor, praying that this military des
potism should be broken up. The
Governor pretended to send up or
ders to Ward, to disband, but these
orders were treated with the same
contempt, that tho writs of tho Dis
trict Court had beon "treated. Final
'
ly, in January or February, thrco|'
or four months after tho
•trances of tliO wllitfl flih'ynna lm /1
of tho whito citizona had
been made, a special officer wlis sent
up at the expenso of the Stato, to
break up tois militajy establishment,
but in doing bo the United States
arms were accidently left in tho hands
of tho negroes, and many of them
used in tho battlo at Colfax.
Tho government pretends in its
last order to grow indignant at Capt.
Ward 8 disobedience, and his lawless
military rule, but what must wo think
of theso professions, and of tho gov
ernment itself, when this Capt. Ward
has remained the favorite of tho gov
ernment, with tree access to tho Gov
ernor's) mansion and one of his chief
advisers and counsellors on the af
iAirsof Colfax; find.whoso word or
indorsement would havo moro influ
ence with Governor Kellogg than
the word or endorsement of tho most
honorable, tho most intelligent, and
most upright white man in the Par
ish of Grant or of Rapides. But it
is one of tho most striking features of
these negro carpet-bag governments,
lost when they seek a counsellor or
adviser, they go to the grogshop, or
gambling room or to some den of po -i
tue
and
litical gamblers or the cockpit and
select a wretch tainted with* some
moral stench, or select some poor ig
norant negro, who perhaps can read
and write, but who has no more idea
of what constitutes honor and integ
rity or the welfare of a parish or the
State, than a blind mau has of colors.
But we have digressed. In March
1873, Capt. Ward is again commis
sioned by the Governor as a Militia
Captain, and authorized to proceed
to Colfax and organizo another mill'
tary company. In this town on his
w§y up, he usked one and -perhapi
two or three leaders of the ltepubli
can party, if they wero not going to
turn out tho officers and put in tho
Kellogg officers by force, and when
answered in tho negative, replied
that that WUs what he was going to
do in Grant. His company was or
ganized, and like his other company,
but unlike all militia companies, went
into regular military caiup, and into
active service. The Court House the
first object of their attack, is broken
open and converted into a military
citadel, and its records appropriated
to military rolls, and other uses. The
Parish Judge, Sheriff, Clerk and Re
corder are not only expelled from of
ffce but with white citizens prohibit
ed from coming within two or threo
miles of Colfax. Judge Rutland's
house is rifled; Judge Richardson's
mother iftid sister are insulted, threat
ened und abused for all the vile char
acters known to tho conception of a
negro, and in this conceptions aie not
inferior to the bilingsgate of the vil
est white man in tho fish market.'
Mrs. Lacour's house is broken open
and rifled—universal terror spreads
for K»ilus around, jind the white fam
ilies flee across the river and to the
pine hills for safety. Ten of Mr. Cruik
shank's mules and his gun are taken
p^der military impressment and car
ried to tho camp at Colfax. For be
ing present at tho attack upon this
military camp which had plundered
his property and driven his family
and tho families of his neighbors in
terror from their homes, ho is now
found guilty of conspiring to distuib
a permeable assembly, and liable to
all its fearful penalties. But not a
whisper of censure i ' b uttered by the
government against Capt. Ward and
his associates, but the Govtrnor has
just issued them a vote of thanks that
thoy have deserved well of their coun
try, and commissioned them to raise
another military company, and by
rape,„robbery anciyjlunder, to spread
terror through tiio country, and cul
minate tho whole in another Col-fax
figlit One would think that the
Irngftj results of the Colfax fight; the
death of.30 or 40 negroes, and three
or four ®hite men; tho rapo and
blight of a blooming girl, tho desolate
homes, and the sorrow of families
who mourn fcr those who are not;
ought to bo sufficient to gratify the
malevolence oven of a Governor, who
represents the venality and falsehood
and brutality of a negro government;
But if it be true, that he has again
organised and armed another negro
militia company in tho parish of
Grant; it seems not. Tho first ex
periment has succeeded so wel.Q. se
cond must bo tried. If his object is
again to bring on a collision between
the negro and tho white man, in or
der to furnish him with another text
from which to preach carpet-bagism
and scalawagism in Louisiana, wo can
ai&nre Lim his euccess will bo com
plete. We will never permit another
negro company to be armed and drill
ed by Mr. Kellogg or his government,
in Grant parish; unless it is dc» c un
der the guard of U. S. soldiery.
such a thing is attempted, wo
will meet it with open war, and apg
peal to the people of tho North, by tho
blood of our ancestors, which was
mingled at Bunker's Hill, Saratoga,
Yorktown, Cowpens and Now Or
leaus, for.protectiou against a despo
potism more desolating than war and
more degrading than that of Poland;
and to the God of battles for tho jus
tice of our cause. And if the issue
is forced upon us, we will not stop
until every carpet-bagger and scal
' iwag who represents Mr. Kellogg,
is expelled from our midst. We
jav 6 been plundered by just such a
rcmon-(carpet-bag and scallawag govern
niCIlfc Î154 TVfp. K"«llnr*i*'ö " «»»fil nr/v
ment as Mr. Kellogg's, until we
have nothing left b t despair. All
security for life has been taken
away or left to perish in the hands
ot venality, imbecility and Ignor
ance. Our fields ha ve bee n mad o
desolate, our homes have been made
the homes of poverty, want, naked
ness, and famiue almost stare us in
the face; and all this has been'
brought about that public plunder
ers may be mado rich.
With all these wrongs, we "will
not sit quietly by and see these Af
rican satraps ot plunder, arm and
drill the tools and instrumenta
through whom they have reached
their power and thus sccure our
chains forever.

Haasland Plantation, »
June 2itb, 1874. )
Editor Caucasian : !
Dear Sir*— Understanding that
the horse disease is prevailing
about your section of country, I
conclude to send you a recipe for
the cure of same which Iliave used
successfully on every case under
my hands.
I first apply warm turpentine
well rubbed hi to the swollen parts,
and then place a piece ot cloth over
same, and press a hot smoothing
iron on it. Then drench the ani
mal with a half pint of whiskey,
mixed well with sulphur, and one
spoonful of spirits of nitre, and a
drachm of iodide of potassium, once
a day, and if the case does not im
prove give it every four hours.
I had one ease, a mule, which I
thought cured after a day or two ;
the swelling had disappeared, and
lie appeared all right, but on last
Sunday evening came up with its
head and neck terribly swollen. I
immediately used the knife on the
swollen parts, and took out as much
as a quart I suppose, of putrid ms'it
ter and lumps of clotted blood. I
then bled him pretty freely,-and in
serted a piece of poke root in each
ot the openings I had made with
the knife, and he is now doing
well. My mules are now all right
would recommend bleeding in
the first treatment.
I enclose you an extract from a
New Orleans paper, I believe from
tho Picayune.
" With a sharp instrument inako
several incisions in tho affected
part, take blistering ointment (flies)
which moisten with coal oil, and
make a plaster large enough to
cover the whole sore. Sutler this
to remain until copious suppura
tion is produced. Meanwhile drench
the animal with a spoonful ot harts
horn in half a bottle of whiskey.
Should the swelling not diminish,
or there bo no apparent relief,
drenching w ith the above described
mixture may be repeated thrice
within five hours, allowing duo in
terval. Keep the sore well cleaned
ind apply coal-oil freely."
I remain yours truly,
A. M. HAAS.

Resolutions, having returned, through
their Chairman W. If. Jack,submitted the
following Preamble and Resolutions, which
were enthusiastically received and unani
mously adopted.
a
resolution s :
Whereas, the career of the public offi
cials of tho Parish of Natchitoches, sinco
the reconstruction of the Stato of Louisi
ana, has beon, almost without exeption,
marked by a wanton disregrrd of the
rights of the people, and systematic spolia
tion of t.he tax payers for their own benefit ;
Anil whereas, eaid oUlcials, representing
in the main neither the intelligence, hon
esty nor material interests of the parish,
have by their gross and criminal corriip»
tion, imposed onerous burdens of taxation
upon the people, which have gradually in
creased from year to year in spite of pro
test or appeal, rising from vo and a half
per cent on valuation of property in 1872,
to six and seven eighths per cent iu 1873,
•nd finally culminating, in 1874, in a total
amount of taxation equal, less one mill, to"
tho highest conventional rate of interest
allowed by tho laws of the State, thus
making property holders mere tenants of
those in power ;
And whereas, having 110 confidence in
the official integrity of those who have
conducted, and are now conducting the
affairs of the parish, and being determined
no longer to submit to their exactions,
which virtually amount to a wholesale
confiscation of property and tho general
impoverishment of all classes of our
people ;
Therefore, be it resolved, that wo will
hereafter resist all extortions or corrupt
and unnecessary extravagances of paro
chial administration by every means in
our power, appealing, if necessary, to the
inherent right of soif-protectiou which is
the basis of all free government, main
taining that the interests 'of those who
pay tdif? to Mippoit th«, g«vrmraenf
•
must control »nd direct it* aflaiii« in uidei
to insure general' prosjmrity ;
And whereas, it is necessary to recapit
ulate some ,of our present grievances, for
which we now Mek and demand remedy,
and to indicate those further grievances
which wo have reason to fear in the
future ;
Be it resolved, that we denounce and
condemn, as illegal and nnauthored. the
following act« of the present Police Jury,
which remain unrepealed, to-wit:
The resolution allowing the President
of that body an annual salary of Six Hun
dred Dollars-; that allowing the clerk of
that body the sunt of Six Hundred Dollars
per annum ; that allowing the Parish At
torney Eight Hundred Dollars, and the
resolution allowing the members of the
Police Jury mileago at the rate of fifty
cents per mile, in direct violation of law,
and we demand that the same shall be
immediately reduced and fixed within le
gal and reasonable limits;
Be it resolved, that we denomroe the ac
tion of the Police Jury in attempting to
create ono currency for the salaries and
commissions of ofllce holders, and another
for tho people, and demand that all shall
share alike, and equally suffer or be bene
fited by the depreciation of tho obligations
of the parish ;
;
Be U resolved, that wo regard the sup
pression of the rosolntion of the Police Ju
ry donating to H. C. Myers, the sum of
Nine Hundred Dollars on account of the
Immigration Bureau, a scheme originally
devised to plunder the people, as indica
ting a just fear of tho indignation of the
pcofrte. and warn tliein that tho tax pay
ers of the parish will not submit to its ro
enactment in any shape ;
Resolved, that we demand the repeal of
the late ordinance of the Police Jury tax
ing tho parish with costs which the Su
preme Court of the Stato condemned the
tax collector to pay, and that tho parish
officials take steps to enforce said -judg
ment, and compel the collcctor to pay said
costs ;
Resolved, that tlio täx-payers of the
Parish of Natchitoches express, in unqual
ified terms, their lack of confidence in J.
R- Hornsby, 8am Black, Ed. Mitchell and
John Holmes, members of the present Po
lice Jury, whom we regard as either cor
rupt or incompetent, and they are hereby
requested to resign, in order that the Gov
ernor may appoint trustworthy citizens to
fill the important position held by them ;
Resoled, that we condemn and de
nounce the »onduct of tho tax-collector in
incurring costs and fees for the benefit oi
himself and friends, in violation of pub
lished instructions from the Auditor, by
advertising tho property of thoso who arc
willing, but unable to pay their taxes, and
for exacting currency from the citizens as
commissions in collecting parish taxes pay
able in the obligations of tho parish, and
in extorting fees not sanctioned by law ;
_ Resolved, that tho ordinance of the Po
lice Jury, vesting in the collector of taxes
the power to decide what parish obliga
tions are legal and receivable for taxes7is
monstrous, in view of the notorious fact
that said official buys and sells tho scrip
for personal profit, and is thus enabled to
reap individual advantage not shared by
the tux payer.
Resolved, that in tho opinion of this
meeting the nppointmer£ of U.C. Myers
as Judge, and the creaWon of the i7r.li
District Court..-was procured to further
and sustain the schemes of plunder and
extortion concocted an« set on foot by
himself und a few others, anil that there is
use to appeal to the courts, where his
judgment would be ono of fast resort in
Iny contest, between the people and offi
cial con option.
That tho condiKt of II. C. Myers, in
coming down from tho bench to engage in
discounting script for the profit of his
ring, is one of tho many official acts illus
trative of his character, and the objects
for which he obtained the high official'po
sition of Judge of tbe 17th District.
I5o it further resolved, that the Chair
man of this meeting bo and he is hereby
authorized to appoint S kvent y member's
of this organization as a permanent Com
mittee of Investigation to examine and
report to this body all derelictions, mal
feasance«, extortions and other illegal and
oppressive acts on tho part of tho several
parochial authorities, with the view that
such action may bo taken as may bo noc
essary in the premises, and that said Com
mittee bo now specially charged to inquire
into and report at tho next meeting of
this body as to Hie following items, to-wit:
First, as to what constituted tho two
several claims of 1>. H. Bonlif, for the re
spective stuns of $*5.00 and $10:58 70-100,
approved and allowed by tho Police Jury
oil 3d inst
Second, whether some of the public offi
cials, or others, havo not from time to time
abstracted from the records, in some in
stances, parish paper on which judgments
had beon obtained, or otherwise subject to
cancellation, and afterwards sold the same
or used it for their benefit the second timo.
Third, whether, under existing laws,
the parish taxes, including the special tax
to pay judgments, can exceed ono hundred
pei centum of the State tax in any year.
Fourth, whether the issue of parish pa
per has exceeded tho appropriations for
any year, and report excess of expendi
tures.
Resolved, that the said committee are
hereby authorized, ie the name of the
people, to be represented by a sub-commit
tee, at all the meotings of the Police Jury
and to suggest such measures of- reform
and economy as may bo deemed proper,
with power especially to examina tho war
rant book of that body at any time, to pre
vent extravagant expenditures of*ihe pub
lic money to favorites or bogus paupers.
Resolved, that in tho opinion of this
meeting, a regular parish, equal to the
State tax, should be levied, 11» uecpssary
to meet tlio legitimate expenses "f the
parish, but the wiiol„e should bo made re
ceivable in parish paper, and th« collec
tion pOHtponed until trie close of the year.
Resolved, that the holders of judgments
against, tho parish, for the payment of
which a special tax of 40 mills has be$o
levied and made payable this year, are
requested to authorize either the reduction
of the tax from its present oppressive rate,
or to delay collection of the same until
the close ot the year, or both.
Resolved, that this Association memori
alize the General Assembly, at its next
session, to repeal the law authorizing
judgments to bo rendered against the par
ish, and tho subsequent collection of the
same in currency, with onerous costs and
interest.
Resolved, that whilst in most cases the
citizens are able and willing to pay the
State taxes, thoy are deterred froui doing
so 011 account of the enormous local bur
dens, amounting, with tho recont reduc
tions, to 50 mills on tho rolls of 1873;
which, from the waut of ability alono, it
nothing else, of the peoplo to pay, wili fi
nally confiscate all the property in the
parish.
He it further resolved, that we denounce.'
as illegal and unauthorized, the custom of
committing courts and magistrates iu cer
• ifring aud approving daims of witnesses
[fur attendance and uiileag" in criminal
cases coming before them, as Mich compeii
«•tion is only legally allowable for their
■ttemUnce in cases coming befcro the Dis
trict Court. ;
Keaolved, that this meeting be declared
a permanent league ol tax-|mjrers. under
the name of the Citizen 's Reform Associa
tion, pledged to carry out all measures
tending to ameliorate the condition of all
classes of the people, and to work zealous
ly against offloial corruption.
Resolved, that the nextfmeeting of this
Association shall be held lit Natchitoches,
ou Saturday, ./une 87th, 1874,
After receiving and adopting tbe reso
lutions, the Hon. W. H. Juck in a telling

Three and a half feet fall since our last
week's report, leaving us still sixteen feet
anil ten inches to go upon apparently, but
the dull sluggish current now in the river
at this point, may leave plenty of ugly
saud bars for our steamers to w'iggle over
long before .we reach attual low water; in.
other word* the channel of the river mnst
be very badly choked np with sand, and
wo will bo sure to have low water earlier
than many anticipate, unless a heavy rain
above occurs, and the Mississippi river
falls rapidly at the same timo.
As for our steamers fnjrn below and
above, we cannot mako a showing forany
thing lileo a report. Tho Lotus was the
only steamer beside the never failing pack
et, that hove in sight from either direction
during the past woek, She passed here
on her way to New Orleans, Thursday
evening about 9 o'clock.
Tho-LcSNie Taylor should give ns a call
to-day, bound Southward, and the Semi
nole is tho only steamer due from below
and we have been looking for her to heave
iii sight every day since Wednesday. The
Behau and Durfeo was also advoitised for
Red River. Since then we learn that the
Durfee has retired to tho other side of the
River to lay up, and the probability is that
tho Behau will follow suit, the Lotus too,
will draw ofT tor awhile and wait for bot
ter times.
The weather has been for the past week
a repetition of the weelri preceding, show
ery anil warm, being Sit little or no ad
vantage to the crops, a good rain now and
then would hetp ns much.
Cotton is doing as well under the cir
cumstances as could be expected. Corn
is improving very much, aud cane with a
(air season will prove to bo the best crop
made in the parish since the war. May it
be so, for our poor peoplo need it badly.
