dlied yesterday in Grant parish at the
advaunced ago of 71 years.
M11ajor Strong was known throngh
out this state. lie was horn in Belle
ville, III., September 14, 1807. Dur
ing the Black Hawk War he entered
the U. S. atrty and attained the rank
of Captain. He remained in the army
until I838, when he resigned, and
having )purclhased a plantation in
Na:itclhitoches parish, lie made it his
home. In January, 1877, Major
Strong was aplpointed a member of
Gov. Nicholls' staff.
His death was not unexpected, as
he had been ill for some time past.
The sad news was yesterday convey
ed by telegraph to his son ; the pres
ent Secretary of State, who had just
artired in the city.
We beg to call attention to the ad
vertisement of Mr. Chas, L'Herisaon
which appears elsewhere. His stock
of groceries is most full and complete,
and his prices are down to suit the
times. If you desire to be astonish

Cotton is going out at $1 50 per
bale and the boats are booming up
on the present water. Freights up
are scarce at card rates. The city
papers say:
Passed down - Cornie Brandon,
Alexandria, MariaLouise each with
full londs of cotton. The Bart Able
came up as high as Alexandria and
re shipped on the Ashland. The Ash
land from New Orleans has our thanks
for a file of city papers.
Steamboat labor is scarce at New
Orleans. Roostabouts are in demand
at from $50 to $60 a month, inclu
ding grub ard free rides. Here's a
splendid opening for some of the gen
teelly dressed chaps walking abouc
town begging for money enough to
buy whisky and sleeping in barrooms
and at the station house to earn an
honest livelihood. But then most of
thieni are opposed to work.
The following particulars of the
accident which happened to the Jo
lBryarly is taken from the New Or
leans Democrat of the 10th :
In all 800 bales of her cargo, which
consisted of 1359 bales, went over
board. On the barge at the time was
Capt. Scovell, two passengers, one of
them Sheriff Williams, of Mansfield,
who was bringing down eight con
victs to Baton Range, who were also
on the barge, with the watchman of
the boat, Martin Leonard, and two
of the roustabouts. Capt. Scovell
was struck and bruised about the
head and body by the stage, the pas
sengers escaped unhurt, but every one
of the rest more or less hurt by the
falling cotton, the watchman be
ing killed instantly by falling bales of
cotton. Sheriff William was hurt in
the face. The wounds of Capt. Scov
ell were slight. The Bryarly took a
foot of water before the leak was
stopped, which was afterwards pump
ed out. She lay by until daylight
and picked up all her cotton that
could be found. The body ofMr.
Leonard, was brought to Bayou Sara
on the Jewel by his son, John Leo
nard, mate of she boat, from whence
it will be sent to his home in the
West.
Out of eight convicts who were on
board six were injured. Miss Lisso
of Conshotta. was knocked down by
a table over turning in consequence
of the shock, but escaped serious in
jury.
The pool line, as we often stated,
is not a monopoly; it is a company
formed by men who have combined
their capital to carry on a special
bosiness, and they have no excinive
right to navigate Red river, for this
stream is free to the enterprise of the
country. By this time our people
must snrely be convinced of this, and
what they are now doing is a knock
down argument in favor of the Demo
crat's stand. They are now crowd
ing their trade, at low water and pre
carious navigation, with most excel- .
lent boats and barges and taking a
away freights at card rates. At .this
wrigting Pineville and Alexandria I
have been cleaned out, and two boats
a week will be on hand to keep them I
free and easy. It would be very well I
for all to remember this, as the usual I
talk of independent boats are already
heard but they will only come when I
there is plenty of water and their own I
trade is unopened. They come for I
the cream, never stay long and de. i
sert us wheb tbh real racket is at

'T'he ( ipple,, imrgai et cl cI a e. has
elicited greai t attention duringii thlie
past tern of couit. It was one of the
most hiottly contested on the part, both
of the State and the defence, we
have hadl here for years. Crippen
and Morgan, two white men and Slier
mand and I-Iead, two colored boys,
were endicted by the Grand Jury for
burning three stables and a cotton
house on the premises of widow Far
cher andil her property ; and for fir
ing into the residence of said widow
Fancher in the night while her prop
erty was being destroyed by the
roaring flames.
Tihese people were ,put upon trial
at the term of our court now pending
and after two days of vigorous as
sault on the part of District Attorney
hall and Cal. W. Ii. Jack for the
State and an equal vigorous defence
by Col. Wm. M. Levy, Messars. Con
ningharums, Smith, Dranguet andl Scar
borough. The result was a hung
Iury.
After the failure of the jury to
agree the prisoners were remanded to
jail, and the bonds were fixed at
$1,000 each
Public opinion ran counter to the
prisoners and a change of venue
to Sabine Parish was arranged but
had not been fully consnmated.
It seems that on Monday night the
prisoners in an effort to escape suc
ceeded in getting out of their cells
into the corrodor of the jail, but, an
alarm being given, they were detect
ed in the act aiid secured. Before
that attempt their families were al
lowed constant intercourse, and we
understand that this was not de
nied them after. In consequence
they were furnished tools with which
they sawed out the planking and dug
through the walls and madb good the
the second attempt.
We understand that the jail is very
loosely guarded, and no vigilance has
been manifested, notwithstanding the
fact that fair warning was given by
the prisoners in an unsuccessful ef
fort to break custody.
Fires-and Alarms Thereof.
The chimney of Mrs Garza's board
ding house took fire on Wednesday
evening last and created quite an ex
citement for a time. Happily no
wind was blowing and the blaze,
which mounted skyward to an alarm
ing height, died down and went out.
Our fire Department, consisting of a
broken ladder and two boys with a
ten dish pan were promptly on the
ground and rendered efficient service
-An excited citizen rushed up and
yelled-"put salt in it!". He was
promptly squelched.
The residence of J. e Breda, be
yond the city limits, took fire on
Thursday morning, from a box of
hot ashes being left on the gallery
and was only saved after the gal
lery and part of the roof had been
consumed.

S THE SUN FOR 1879.
(V
S THn SUN will be.pnblished every day during
e the year to come. Its purpose and method will
be the same as in the past : To present all the
news in a readable shape, and to tell the truth
though the heavens fall.
y The Sun has been, is. and will continue to be
g independent of everybody and everything save
the Truth and its own convictions ofduty. That
e is the only policy which an honest newspaper
need have. That is the policy which has won for
y this newspaper the confidence and friendship of
a wider constituency than was ever before en.
Sjoyed by any other American Journal.
The Sun is the newspaper for the people. It
is not for the rich man against the poor man, or
for the poor man against the rich man, but it
weeks to do equal justice to all interests in the
Scommunity. It is not the organ of any person,
class, sect or party. There need be no mnistery
y about its loves and hates. It is for the honest
man against the rogues every time. It is for the
Shonest Democrat as against the dishonest Rep
ublican, and for the honest Republican as against
Sthe dishonest Dcmocrat. It does not take its cue
from the utterance of any politician or political
Sorganization. It gives its support unreservedly
when men or measures are in agreeance with
the Constitution and with the principals upon
Swhichthis Republic was fonnded forthe people.
Whenever the Constitution and constitutional
Sprinciples are violated--as in the outrageous
g conspiracy of 18718, by which a man not elected
was placed in the President's office, where he
B still remains-it speeks ont for the right. That is
The Sun's idea of independence. In this respect
B there will be no change in the programme for '79
- The Sun has fairly earned the hearty hatred
of rascals, frauds, and humbug. of all sorts and
* sizes. It hopes to deserve that hatred not less
in the year 1879, than in 1878, 1877, or any yease
gone by. The Sun will continue to shine on thf
wicked with unmitigated brightness.
- While the lesson of the past should be con.
stantly kept beforethe people, The Sun does
no prepose to make Itself in 1879 a magazine of
f ancient history. It is printed for the men and
women of to-day, whese concern is chiefly with
F the affairs of to-day. It has both the disposition
and abilisy to afford its readers the promptest,
- fullist, and most accurate inteligence of what.
ever in the wide world is worth attention. To
this end the resources belonging to well-eetab
lished prosperity will be liberally employed.
The present disjoined condition of parties in
this country, and the uncertainty of the future,
lends an extraordinary significance to the events
of the coming year. The discussions of the
press, the debates and acts of Congress, and the
movements of the leaders in every section of the
Republic will havea direct bearing on the Pres
i dential election of 1880-an event which must
be regarded with the most anxious interests by
Severy patriotic American, whatever his politi
eal ideas or allegiance. To these elements of in
Swests may be added the probability that the
Democracy will control both houses of Con
groess, the increasing feebleness of the fraudlent
AdmiPisetration, and thespread and strengthen
I ing everywhere of a healthy abhorance of fraud
in say form. To present with accuracy and
clearness the exact situation in each of its vary
ing phases, and to expound, according to its
I well-knows'nethods, the principles that should
guide us through the labyrinth, will be an im
portant,part .o The Sun's work for 1579.

political, a literary and a general newspaper,
