Summary of Events
About “the end of the world” there
has always existed great fascination,
and many religious sects have
believed they had knowledge
of the exact hour and moment
and method by which this old
earth would cease. The lat-

End of
World.
est of these called the “Latter Reign
of the Apostolic Church”, pitched its
camp in West Duxbury, Massachu
setts, and awaited the final hour —10
o’clock last Friday morning. The
scheduled termination has as yet been
postponed, and the exhausted zealots
are returning to their once prosper
ous homes, probably now pauperized.
The sorrowful experience of one sect
seldom seems to deter another from
this particular form of folly. Out
west, we are told that there is a
Watch Tower Tract and Bible Socie
ty which expects the end in 1914. If
this be true, we trust those good
people will stop their religious ef
forts short of completely impoverish
ing themselves and take heed of the
plight of the Duxbury folk. The
world is young, and just now en
gaged in a skittish flirtation with the
rosy Mars. It is good for many a
year yet.
About the “end of the world” who,
after all, should be disturbed? Not
in the thought of “the clouds, as a
scroll” rolling away, or the stars fall
ing from the sky, or any of the othei’
spectacular things, lies the real hor
ror and sorrow; but in the thought
of the millions of lives, human and
brute, which must come and go, in
questioning and suffering, through
all the future ages. We will perish,
and maybe our history pass away;
our lands become sea, and our seas
become land, and our civilization be
submerged and forgotten like that of
the lost Atlantis. Yet the God who
reigneth lias planted in each soul the
sense of His own nearness and the
capacity for trust, and if there be an
eternity, we are living in it now. It
will not come with trumpetings and
terror.

the wounds could have
been self-inflicted, and Dr. Geo. Tully

the latter's views are so reasonable,
the formers’ so theoretical, that the
public must believe that, under no
evidence, will the Naval authorities
do justice.

Mr. Taft, in his Chicago speech,
made a bitter attack upon the law’s
delay, especially in criminal cases.
All must admit that the uncertainty
of conviction has had much to do
with creating that disrespect for the
courts which is so prevalent and
open, but what hope is there for bet
terment when a branch of the gov
ernment affords such a flagrant ex
ample of injustice as has been man
ifested in the Sutton case? Or in
the Coulter case, near Atlanta, where
a soldier was shot down and the
guilty officer and private “completely
exonerated from blame?’’ Or in
West Point, where the commanding
officer has been humiliated in his best
efforts to stop the crime of hazing?
Mr. Taft has a deal to do as the head
of the Army and Navy, as well as of
the various Civil departments, to
ward setting a high example of im
partial justice. There are enough to
speak and write against the present
abuses, but to him has been given
the power to bring a few maraud
ing corporations to justice, to inter
est himself personally and effective
ly in jailing a few malefactors, to
assist in breaking up demoralizing
practices that creep into officialdom
generally, whether military or civil;
and the public will be far more im
pressed by the results than by his
verbiage. The lip-service of the na
tion is perfect; we all agree that
wrong things are wrong; even the
criminal doesn’t defend himself by
arguing that -what he did was right
—he gets an alibi. What Mr. Taft
needs to do is to prove that some
wrong things are dangerous, and if
he manages that he will have most
general, vociferous and non-partisan
plaudits.
❖ ❖ *
Mr. Taft's tour continues to give
a good imitation of an elephant
crossing a bog. Every time he drags
his clumsy foot out of some hole
into which his tactlessness plunged
it, Slosh! goes his other deeper in the
ooze. His speech to some of the
farmers in the West was a peculiarly
happy stroke. Beaming down at
those assembled, he girlishly con
fessed that he “didn’t know how to
talk to farmers, as he had never
milked a cow,” or some other bright
remark of the same tenor. If he had
ever been a real farmer, Mr. Taft
would have had sense enough to
know that farmers don’t assemble to
hear a celebrity “talk shop” any more
than other bodies of men do. Mr.
Taft need not have worried over his
inability to talk “down to their level,’
at all. The chances are that the
farmers were as well, or better in
formed, than he on a considerable
number of general topics, and that
their minds w r ere not engrossed by
milking or plowing. The “Wa-all, I
dew swan to Goshen!” variety of
rustic may still lurk among the cob
ble-stone farms of New England, or
old York state, but elsewhere he nev
er existed out of novels and Taft’s
intimation that he was at a loss to
talk to farmers was an insult to
their intelligence and education. He
didn’t mean it so, no doubt. It was
just that obstreperous foot of his
chugging into the mud.

of yore. When the stamp tax applied
and it was thought the corporation
would have to bear its share of the
Spanish-American war expenses, did
it not flatly refuse to accept any
package until the customer had af
fixed the stamp? Has it not always
kept its boot-licking henchmen in
Congress to fight the Parcels Post,
or any other measure that would
weaken its clutch upon the people?
The whole express system reeks with
abuses.
The writer once received some ex
press packages on which several dol
lars were collected. Surprised, the
consignor was 'written to and the re
ply from him enclosed the receipts,
showing that the charges had been
fully prepaid. Taking these receipts
to the office, the calm statement was
made by the company that “there
was a credit due me on their books!”
Doubtless hundreds of prepaid pack
ages are thus collected for twice,
where the consignee is receiving a
package from a friend and has too
much delicacy to inquire about the
charge. Otherwise, why a system of
“crediting” about which nothing is
said until the company is confronted
with the evidence of having received
double pay? A mistake was not
claimed. They made the consignee
pay before leaving the prepaid pack
age, and then wiggled out of it with
the absurd statement of “a credit
due.” In that way they rebate when
they must, and where they are not
caught up with and made to disgorge
the extra money goes to the profit ac
count, so they can afford to hire more
lobbyists.

Jeffersonian Club News
Organization is proceeding slowly,
but surely. Organizers do not seem to
understand that it is not necessary
to wait until a large crowd gathers,
to elect officers and form a temporary
organization. Half a dozen men can
start the club off; then they can go
to work to get new members, and at
the next meeting a permanent or
ganization can be formed by electing
regular officers and adopting by-laws,

ing, especially on the
round-trips, with various stop-overs.
All the suggestions, as well as the
present method, contemplate that the
loss of his ticket falls on the pas
senger, without any chance for re
dress. It would appear that this
might be obviated by a system of
registration. Say, for a reasonable
fee, the seller registered the ticket
on his books, with, in addition, some
identifying word known only to
himself and the passenger. Then let
the registration be wired off by the
conductor as soon as that ticket has
been used on his division. In this
way, a lost or stolen ticket, reported,
could be re-issued anywhere oxi the
road; but one trip on that ticket could
be made, as but the original purchaser
would have the pass-word, even
though someone else had the infor
mation, and registering the ticket off
as used would prevent the attempt on
the part of a ticket thief to make
use of the ticket. This is not offered
as a perfect plan—it might be very
impracticable. But the loss of an
expensive ticket is a very serious one
to anyone stranded in a strange city.
If persons have paid for their ride
there should be some way to protect
them. Accidents, thefts and forget
fulness in travelling make such losses
common, as well as keeping the ner
vous passenger in some trepidation.
The passenger going 3,000 miles
across the ocean does so on a little
coupon, but he is registered very
carefully. If a ship goes down, the
lost are known; if a train is wreck
ed, the “unidentified dead” are a
usual feature. Some system of reg
istration for passengers taking long
trips might be a very wise thing for
more than one reason, always mak
ing such registration voluntary with
the passenger, and for his own pro
tection.
