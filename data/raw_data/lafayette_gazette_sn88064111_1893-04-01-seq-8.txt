A&O TIHER OFFER.
Mr. John H. Humble, the gener
al representative of the Ferris Sugar
Manufacturing Company, Limited,
operating two large refineries, one on
Bayou Teche near the town of Frank
lin, and the other at Barbreck, St.
Landry parish, was in Lafayette
Monday and Tuesday.
Mr. Gumble told The Gazette
that his company intended to build
another refinery, and was looking
over the field with a view of select
ing the place that will offer the best
inducements. He has his eyes on
several points, but is very favorably
impressed with Lafayette as a suita
ble place, and should the people be
inclined to meet him part of the way,
he will establish a large plant here.
The proposition that Mr. Humble
intends to submit, later on, to the
people in behalf of his company em
braces a donation of $25,ooo in
mone --and a- gite of, say, fifteen
acres of land, on w:hich the factory
will be erected. Mr. Humble thinks
a site on Bayou Vermiion in ce
proximity to the railro 5 uld be
the most advantage - for all con
cerned. Thi positionwill stand
-,. proposition will stand
regardl of whether the tax being
,ently asked by Mr. Leslie is car
ried or not.
At the present price that sugar is
quoted in the New Orleans market
the factory would pay $4.25 a ton.
Taking the ascertained general aver
age yield of cane, with present pri
mitive methods of cultivation, in
this parish last year was a fraction
over 20 tons per acre. Thus it will
be seen that the farmer planting cane
and selling to the factory would rea
lize on 20 tons $85 an acre, instead
of an average of less than $12 per
acre on cotton as at present.
Should this offer be acted favora
bly upon the factory would be in
working shape by October 1894. In
the meantime with the existence of
their present facilities, the present
planted crop of cane could be han
dled. And if he can secure the in
ducements necessary to enable him
to buil a factory here, it will be of
a: capacity to handle mooo tons a day,
or as anuch, if riot more, than the en
tire parish could cultivate.
While The Gatette looks upon the
idea of building a refinery as of prime
1. ment, and recognizes the pressing
t~ed of one, it is puzzled to know
h:tw this sum can be raised without
r'course to a popular subscription,
i.smuch as the law expressly for
bids the levying of a special tax for
p)rposes of this nature, short of a
a cial act of the legislature.
And. the only feasible way, to our i
umind, would be to vote the railroad
tax, thereby securing the necessary
Sinus. If there is any other way to
, pass the realization of a large
tictiery, The Gazette would heartily
epouse it, as it will any other mea
"sure teqding to the advancement of 4
"be satnrial interests of the Parish
e f Lafayette.
fr " A central refinery is acrying need.
PfROAMfSCUOOUS IMMlGRA
Of course we want immigration to
our vacnt lands. But we want I
ight k;; those who will make
and identify themselves <
a of the people, to bet- I
ion, and also work
dig of the country. t
Iaines of-oreign c
people who will come here, bringing
with them their clannishness and all
f the selfishnes that it entails.
To day Pennsylvania is crying out
against the trouble breeding Hunga
rians, who are a drag to the sections
in which they are congregated. New
d York has a surplus of Italians, and
- if they have proven themselves a de
sirable acquisition, the home people
havrfailed to find it out. Whenever
) these people have settled in any
numbers they have forced out of em
ployment the native labor, by the
fact that they subsist on what an
American would starve.
As we stated before we want im
migration in this section. We want
that kind of immigration that has
made tik 'Vest what it is to-day. In
other words, we want the people
from the WVest; we want the people
from the crowded East, in short we
want that sort of immigration that
will come here and be of us
But we don't want the waifs and
strays of the squalor-ridden districts
of European cities.
COfME TO LAFA YE TTE.
Did you ever stop to think how
many men of more than average in
telligence are spending their lives
working in the shops, the factories,
in the cities, working from early till
late, barely earning enough to sup
port their families, seldom accumu
) lating enough to own a house, and
with prospects of any day being
thrown out of employment, not sure
from where to-morrow's bread shall
come, not knowing but that sickness
r or death would rob their little ones
of the necessaries of life, and leave
1 them at the mercy of the cold world?
Did you ever stop to think that a
man of ordinary intelligence and
limited means can come to South
western Louisiana, to our healthful
climate and get a home? Not by
paying high rent, not facing a dirty,
narrow street, but on our beautiful
prairies, surrounded by the most
productive lands under the sun; a
garden of Eden that needs but till
ing, with good schools near growing
towns, intelligent, agreeable neigh
bors, and every thing to make a hap
py comfortable home, surrounded by
peace and pleuty.
Come to Lafayette parish.
jT PA YS.
The Morgan City Advocate re
ports that Mr. Jacques Lehman is
finding that the steam caa~c2; -"f
his c tnnj f ,3 - 'k not sufficient
to meet the demands made upon it by
the large orders that are pouring in.
His first shipment was for Tyler,
Texas. New Orleans will receive
25o cases; a carload is ordered for
Galveston, and 300 cases are billed
for California.
This reminds the writer of an in
cident occuring in Houston, Texas,
about eighteen months ago. Seeing
a pile of boxes canned vegetables in
front of a grocery store, he noticed
the shipper's brand read: 11
Rienzi, Miss.," and the thought at
once occured to him, if some far off
factory could can and ship those
goods to Texas, why could not south
west Louisiana, where the lands are
so well adapted to the cultivation of
all kinds of vegetables? His curios
ity being aroused, he started out to
ascertaiir, and did, where is, and
what kind of a place was Rienzi. It
is a small town of about 200 people
situated in the extreme northern part
of the State. This factory is oper
ated by a family of seven, who must
can man)y boxes to ship as far South
as Texas.
WVe learnt further that these peo- 1
ple had induced the small neigh
boring farmers to abandon cotton
and cultivate vegetables. Instead of
realizing about $i4 an acre as for- I
merly, they saw their lands bring
them over $35 an acre with less labor.
The result has been that tÂ·he factory I
people are making money, and the I
farmers are making money. And
all are contended.
Nowv, there is no good reason un
der the sun why a factory right here
in Lafayette should not pay hand- I
some returns.
And we are going to have one, one
of these fine mornings.
PUBLIC ROADS. i
Periodically the press of the State I
discuss the question of roads in the
country. t
This is the time of year that the
discussion has begun in good ear
nest, And their worthy efforts seems
to be appreciated, and heeded, in r
some instances. I
There can be no question as to
the value of good roads. It bene
fits the farmer as well as the mer- I
chants, in fact everybody is conve- i
nienced. c
The present system of working i
the public roads falls short of ac
complishing any lasting good. This, c
g however, is not due to the law under
LI which this system is operated, but
rather to the indifferance- of those
it called out to do the work. Time and
again we have seen crowds of men
s gathered to work, and after throw
w ing a few spadesful .of dirt in the
d middle of the road, quit, and then
wonder when the rainy season sets
e in why the roads are in such terrible
r bad condition.
y Convictions, we know, are prac
m- ticably impossible now, but the law
e is not altogether at fault.
n Create a public sentiment in four
of good roads, and then the law
i- would be found adequate to bring
tt the chronic shirkers in line.
s FR UITS.
n The climate of southwestern Louis
e iant not being subject to rapid and
e extreme changes in temperature, nor
e late spring frosts, and having a soil
t particularly adapted to their growth,
Lafayette Parish, has flattering pros
pects of becoming one of the fore
s most parishes in this section in friit
culture.
Already she has shown marked
v signs of this in her production of
many varieties, developing perfectly,
s maturing nicely, and bearing proli
, fically. The peach, especially, grows
1I nicely, and orchards that have been
set out, and with scarcely an excep
tion, where the trees -have been
I properly cared for and protected
g from stock, they make rapid growth,
e showing a thrifty and healthy condi
i tion.
s But it is not only the peach that
s fares well. In the great variety that
e will do equally as well we might
? mention, the fig, apricot, pears,
a grape, and the like.
I This is a favored country indeed.
The Teche and Vermilion and
the Great Southern Telephone com
Y panies have joined forces, and now
have a circuit embracing every town
1 from Washington to and including
t New Orleans, save Lafayette.
a The people of Opelousas, for in
stance, can talk ten minutes with
9 friends in New Orleans for 25 centr,
- but Lafayette is reduced to the
necessity of paying the same sum
Y for the privilege of sending ten
words. Of course if the people o
Lafayette choose to pay the piper
for this expensive luxury, it is their
right, but it strikes us that it is the
s old story of saving at the spigot to
Swaste at_
t Gen. Jastremski's name has been
~ mentioned for the post of minister
to Buenos Ayres, Argentine. Repu
blic. As a soldier, citizen, stal
wart Democrat, and the friend of
r the printer, the (;enaral is well
known. Should the President make
the appointment hewill have a faith
- ful and worthy minister.
The people of the riparian parishes
are beginning to view with some ap
prehension the rising rivers, know
ing the danger that its coming down
forebodes. Every year it is the
same; those people live in constant
dread of seeing their lands overflow
just at planting time, and it gene
rally recedes too late to plant a
crops. Why don't some of the in
dustrious who would wish to live in
comfort come to Lafayette? Never
an overflow here.
An old gentleman from Alabama 1
in conversing with a Gazette man
the other day expressed the opinion
that our people are ignorant of the
vast capabilities of their lands. He
says that a man can work less and
made a better living here than any
place he has ever visited. In Ala
bama the farmers have so little
money that to get a dollar out.
of them is like asking them to
let you pull out a tooth from their
heads. He adds however they are t
the most hospitable people on the
face of the earth. And so are the I
people of Lafayette as hospitable as
any that can be found.
COTTOiV VS. PROGRESS.
Commnunicated.
Cotton ! King Cotton ! has at
last reached a point where it is so ,
touch-me-not as to keep those who
raise it in want of the absolute ne
cess ies of life.
It is not the over production that I
impoverishes the mass of the people,
but conditions that places the staple
at the mercy of speculation. Ins
tance the last crop, which being a
small one,should have commanded a a
good price, but since the rumors of e
increased acreage for this year has I
reached the ears of the .speculative
power, the market goes up by strides. t
They have already figured out ab
crop of from nine to ten millions si
bales, and this before a single seed "
has been sowed in the ground, and
on these figures the present market "
is lowered to a mere song. h
Now, admitting that the cotton h
crop of 1893 would be nine millions ~e
r bales, -an4 it -would sell.for 5 or 6
t cents a pound;, therefore as long as,
e it would find -a ready sale, neither
I high or-low, Is proof that there it
a always a demand for all that is made,
- consequently it ,i not the over-pro
e duction that-creates panics.
a But why not make other crops in
s abundance, and- have cotton as a
e surplus crop. There are enough
working people alL over the cotton
states " that can doable their crops
v of corn, potatoesy cane, etc., in a
few years in .decrealtng gradually
r the cotton crop, until they will rea
r lize that the tin is up to work for
J themselves and not for speculators.
Can any man pay z2Y cents per
pound for salted meat and make
one Wale of cotton to every three
acres of land pMlahted, and sell that
r bale of cotton it 6 ceits and make
I any progress ? .,ertainly not, Why
then not plant more grain, and raise
at home that meat and all other ne
cessities, aind 1e' -happy,' and work
t for One's sef,' ' gad 6d' htavlhtg'the
nose on. the: gsn trona t fram year
i year.
Wf e have had plenty of time, sint&
almost thirty years; commencing
with cotton at $125 a bale and gra
dually coming Clown to. the prese&
price of $25, to find out that at the
latter price it is ,next to impossible
to make a living. What we want is
a diversity of crops, we want a
change of some kind, then let us all
agree to reduce': cottei acreage in
crease corn aid other products;
t plant largely ig canes, raise our own
t supplies, more -,egetables, fruits,
etc., and no doubt we will find a
change for the, better. Let cotton
be sold at what it may, and stop
putting it at the head of our hopes
and dependance for a living.
I hope to hear in the future a
general cry of down with cotton and
up with more gtin and house sup
plies. . **
MEMORIAL BA,2AAR.
To Be Field in Richmrona, Va.,
April II, j893.
The Ladies' Hollywood Memorial
Association, aided by the Junior
Hollywood, the Oakwood and He
brew Memorial Associations, and all
'Ã½-. Confederate Camps, will hold a
bazaar for the benefit of the monu
ment now being raised to the P.: Ã½ .de
Soldier and sail --t-e - Confeder
acy, and fo the Confederate Mu
.se', to be esta ished in the house
in which President Davis resided
during the war. This house having
been given to the ladies by the city
of Richmond, they ask the help of
every man, woman, and child, in or
der that the entire South may share
in the honor of erecting these two
monuments.
Each Confederate State will be
represented by a table bearing its
name, shield, and colors, and arti
cles received will be given to the
table which may be designated by
the donor.
It is befitting that to the daunt
less chieftain and his heroic fol
lowers these two monuments be
raised in the Capital of the Confer
deracy, the one spot'which can never
lose its identity with the cause for
which they struggled and died.
Money and articles, small and
large, for table or restaurant, for use
or beauty, should be addressed to
"Memorial Bazaar," Richmond,
Va.
All packages forwarded free by
Southern and Adams Express Corn- -
panies, when under twenty-five
pounds.
Name and residence of the con
signee should be in the corner, but
not given as part of the address.

VFRMIL/ON COTTOATADE.
John A. Morris' steam yatcht is
upholstered with ,ottonade made by
a lady living pn Vermil.on river
about four miles1 above Abbeville.
Grover Clevelau4has a suit of cot
tonade made by' an aged widow
whose home is near Long Point, in
this parish. Shk!planted the cotton,
worked the growing crop, and often
picking the fleecy staple herself,
converted it into cloth. Her hands
alone performed and accomplished
the same end which the manufacture
of ordinary clothing requires thous
ands.--Abbevilic Meri~ional.
There is getting to be something
wrongwith the Frcpch duel. Another
man has been hurt in one of them.
To be sure, his injury was much less
severe than would have been caused
by a sliver under the thumb, but it
tends to unwholesome defiance of
precedent.
Deserted Towns.
There are twenty well built towns in Kan
sas without a single inhabitant to waken the
echocs of their deserted streets. Saratoga
has a $3o,ooo opera house, a large brick ho
tel, a $2o,o0o school house and a number of
fine business houses, yet there is nobody even
to claim a place to sleep. Her banks remain,
but they are silent. Some of her dwelling
stand there as monuments to the credulity of
man. At Fargo, a $25,ooo school house
stands on the side cif the hill, a monument
of the bond voting crarze. Most of the build
ings have been removed or torn down. The
hotel keeps gloomy watch over the rem.ining"
houses, aided by the bank. A herder and
his family constitute the s',le poputation of'
what was once an incorporated city, ~.s an
