They will bring results, for they need
only to be seen to be appreciated.
I am one of the so-called rock
ribbed Democrats, but I am proud to
say that I am not so case-hardened
but what I can believe the truth
when I see it in black and white and
not successfully denied by anybody.
The only thing that is needed (as I
see it), is to spread the gospel as
preached by the two Jeffersonians.
I deem it of far more importance
than sending missionaries to China,
or any other old place.
If 1 could get to the end of my pen
what is in my heart, this letter would
probably make interesting reading,
but that is impossible as I have a
poor way of expressing myself. Nev
ertheless my vote counts as much as
any other one man’s in the United
States, and you may always count
on it as long as you advocate the
principles you now advocate.
Yours truly, W. F. BROWN.

PROPOSES FOUR ISSUES FOR
PLATFORM.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: —This old one-armed
farmer veteran, with limited ability,
has been thinking along the lines of
so many reformers, write you a con
ference of wise head's. While I pre
fer to hold fast to all the reforms
you have so eloquently defended, yet
it appears that the autocrat must be
dethroned before you and others can
hope to accomplish any great num
ber of these reforms.
How would it do to make the ini
tiative referendum, recall and propor
tional representation the exclusive is
sues? These issues are only opposed
by the unimpaired and the autocrat
and his agents. The Federalist and
the Whigs were swept out of power
and out of existence decause their
leaders were opposed to the people’s
rule. It is time history was repeat
ing itself. Autocracy never divides,
their cunning deceives. The auto
crats through their agents, chosen
for them by the people, are in as com
plete control of the Republican and
Democratic parties today as they
were of the Whig and Federalist par
ties.
I am inclined to believe that now,
this year, 1909, is the time and con
dition ripe for a new political align
ment. If so, should not the organi
zation proceed along the lines these
four great issues would or should de
velop?
A government cannot be truly rep
resentative when only a part of the
people is represented; this has been
so for many years.
Taxation without representation
was wrong one hundred and forty
years ago; it’s wrong today.
Proportional representation will
give the minority this equitable right
while we must submit to the majority
and should when the power is hon
estly applied. The minority repre
sentative will be the watchman of
the night, the honest detective to
testify for the good and against the
disobedient.
These four great issues would be a
shield to the honest representative
and a sword in the hands of the
people.
Wishing you and yours success,
H. M. McCUTSTIAN.

OLD PARTIES ARE DESTROYING
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES
OF OUR GOVERNMENT.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir and Friend: —I say
friend because I believe you to be the
best friend to the common people,
and especially to the old Confederate
soldiers of any political leader now
in the United States. I am sorry to
have to say that after the bold stand
you have taken and the sacrifice you
have made in behalf of the ex-Con
federate soldiers and the common
people a great many of them don’t
appreciate what you-have done; but
still go on voting for one of the old
parties which I believe to be twins in
purpose, and destroying the very
fundamental principles of this Gov
ernment.
I have been almost a constant read
er of your literature for sixteen or
seventeen years, and I surely endorse
the stand you have taken and almost
all that I know you have said, and
especially the way you have exposed
the missionary fraud of late.
I have voted for Watson every
time I have had the chance to do so;
I was the only one who voted for
Watson in this precinct in November,
1908. Some of the voters said to
me: “If you vote for Watson you’ll
lose your vote.’’ I said: “Not so.
A vote cast for the right principle is
never lost, though it may be for the
defeated candidate.’’ In 1892 this,
Cherokee County, voted 700 majority
for Jeffersonian Democracy. Now it
is different, something is wrong.
Inclosed I send you $1 to renew
my subscription to both Jeffersonians
for six months. I am very poor but
can’t do without your Jeffersonians.
Wishing you success in all your
business so long as you are in the
right, I am,
yours truly,
JOHN F. HOGE.

ENOUGH POPULISTS LEFT “FOR
SEED.’’
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir:—Please find enclosed
order for $3, for which renew my
subscription to both magazine and
paper. I also send you a new sub
scriber to the Magazine, which makes
me entitled to one of your knives.
1 have been a subscriber to your pa
per and magazine for only one year,
but I voted my first vote for you in
the last election. I am one of the
twenty-five that voted for you at our
precinct in Johnson Township, Clark
County, so you see there are still
enough of us Populists left for seed
up here in Illinois.
Wishing you and both Jeffersonians
success, I am,
Yours truly,
FRANK PARTLOW.
Casey, 111., R. F. D. No. 3.
A PAPER THAT STANDS FOR THE
PEOPLE.
Editor “The Jeffersonian”:
Dear Sir: —I notice that my sub
scription expired yesterday, which
shows that I am unmindful of my
duties to a cause which is not sup
ported as it should be by the masses.
We stand on thin ice, hoping that
such men as you will save us without
an effort on our part. This waiting
for something to turn up to save us
is to be the ruin of this country at
no distant day. Graft and crime are
paramount because the wealthy can
ride roughshod over the law where it
interferes with them, buy the courts,
and make them subservient to every
whim. Ye gods! I pity you and the
few other publications that unsel
fishly stand for the people.
The voice of an uncorrupted paper
is like the murmur of virtue in a sea
of evil. Don’t you ever get discour
aged? I said I pitied you, but that
pity is born of admiration for your
grand and indomitable courage in
such an unequal task. This dollar I
send to renew my subscription seems
mighty small for my share in spread
ing the good work.
Perhaps some one that is asleep
will awake before the fumes of the
fires that roll beneath his feet suffo
cate him.
Yours truly,
A. N. JUDD,
Watsonville, Cal., 263 Lake Ave.
WOULD LOVE TO SEE REFORM
ERS UNITE.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: —I was a delegate at the
People’s Party Convention at Spring
field, 111., four years ago, and also at
St. Louis last fall, and I cast my bal
lot for T. E. Watson every chance I
have. Have voted the straight Peo
ple’s party ticket since 1896, and I
am proud of it.
I endorse the stand you take on
Foreign Missions to a T.
I would love to see all the reform
15b* 'Jeffersonian
parties united. I. don’t think there
would be any Socialist party in the
United States today if we had never
fused with the Democrats. This is
only a poor farmer’s opinion.
This is the age where dollars have
more weight than opinions or theo
ries, so please find enclosed $1 for
the Jeffersonian Magazine, for one
year.
Always count on me.
Yours, C. N. SAPP.
Farina, 111., R. F. D. No. 2.
A UNION VETERAN AND A GOOD
POPULIST.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson.
My Dear Sir: —I have not seen any
word in The Jeffersonian from this
part of Florida, and so I have con
cluded to drop you a few lines.
Although I am an old Union vet
eran, I admire you and your writings
and the manly way in which you han
dle the missionary cranks. I think
crank Scoville should crawl into his
hole and pull the hole in after him,
to be seen no more or heard from
again. I am like you about the For
eign Mission fraud. I think charity
should commence at home. First let
the thousands of poor and illiterate
be cared for at home, and let China
and other nations take care of their
own poor. If we provide for our
own worthy poor we will have all we
can attend to, and it will take all the*
surplus cash that can be raised in
this country to make them comforta
ble and educate them. I am sorry
that 1 am so financially poor I cannot
help you more than I do, but such is
the case, or I would have the two
Jeffersonians instead of one.
I believe in your platform and I
have done all I could to spread the
cause. I voted for you in the last
election and got five others to do the
same. I am an old Union veteran,
but I have as much respect for those
who wore the gray as I have for those
the blue. That was a cruel and un
called for war; many a brave and
noble man on both sides lost his life
in it; many a poor woman and child
suffered the pangs of hunger and
cold by it, and if there is any pun
ishment in the future life, those who
caused that cruel war must surely
pay the penalty.
I hope and pray that your cause
will reign triumphantly over this
nation, as I think it’s honest and just,
and I will do all I can for you and
the cause.
With best wishes, I remain,
Yours for truth and justice,
A UNION VETERAN.

GRAFT THE LEVER IN POLITICS.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: —Inclosed find money
order for sl, for which please send
me the Watson Magazine.
While I have about “lost out” in
the hope of ever doing anything to
check the greed and deviltry of or
ganized trusts and combinations, who
absolutely own and direct the action
of the old parties, it does me good to
read the truth as you tell it about
the rascals.
There are scores of voters all over
the country that detest the politics
of both the Republican and Demo
cratic parties and would shout ho
sannas of joy at their downfall, but
what else can we expect when Joe
Cannon and that township Senator
of Rhode Island, Aldrich, can dictate
to the Democratic patriots (?) what
to do and they do it? Graff is a
lever in our national politics that is
a power that will be hard to over
throw; too many voters who go to
elections and who want to “see a
man” as soon as they get to the
voting place. Very truly,
I. E. HODGES.
Dix, Illinois, R. F. D. No. 2.
