The Library Qaestion
The consolidation of the two libraries
was not f fscted at the meeting callea for
that purpose Tue day evening. But we
hope it will be at an early day. It hinged
on just two things, viz: The payment of
the small indebtednees now due by the
Mechanios' Libriry and a revenue of $74
peS month to maintain the Library. Of
this amount 925 minthly is given by the
aoily, the remaining $50 could easily b3
raised by inoreasing the yearly dues, say
to $5. It is out of she question to think
running a library without a decert rev
erue. The $1 annual dues of the Shreve
port Library are totally inasucient for iiit
maltenance, Tbhe time hba now come,
when loth libraries riuit do something or
fall through. Although Shreveport is not
a reading town, surely, there are two
hundred people nla It who will pay $5 a
year to support a firt class library. The
privileges and benefits of the library need
not be expatiated on here, but I will say
this: It will save money, for one the
reads, to belong to the library at $5 a year;
fer any three of the current publications
will costthat much, while $6 will g!ve
thebs members oaccess to more than 2,001
volumes.
Think of the matter friends, and put
your name on the list for a $5 snbsorlp
tion.

It is p II l1 a ing to note the increas
ilo n enuwr of womwo going into news
paupr wooi in the smn:ller cities of the
VIion. Tih daily papers In many of
these srialler cities have really more
genuine originality and scope than the
great, many blanketed sheets, for all
their fuss and feathers. On the jour
nal of the small Inland city there Is
gore Americanism of aentinient, con
sequently less prejudice against wo
mnin's occupying responsible places,
than can be found in centers like New
York and ('htcago. Aspiring young
women begin to find this out, and are
knocking at the door of journalism in
towuis V. lihre it will be opened to them.
It is picasing, too, to note that many
of these young women are college grad
uates, trained to write good English
and to use their brains to think. To
those who serve their apprenticeship
faithfully in the country towns, if later
they desire to hazard their fortunes in
one of lhe great cities, the way will
open. Portraits and sketches of the
Misses Louise and Georgia IBoynton,
respectively editor in chief and busi
ness muanagerof a paper in Perth Am
boy, N. J., have been widely published.
The young ladies are both Vassar grad
untes. The paper was a weekly when
they bought it. They changed it into
a successful daily. In Titusville, Pa.,
a young lady-Miss Mary Lee-is city
editor of a daily paper. She first duly
worked her time as a general reporter,
which is the natural road to newspaper
promotion. Miss Lee watches every
item of her local department till the
paper goes to press at 2 In the morning.
Many a time it is necessary for her to
go out at night and get a hurried news
story, which the nervy, brainy young
woman does without the least hesita
tion and in perfect security.

A summer woods camp for girls bars
been suggested, where they may live in
freedom and enjoy physical sports at
will. Yes, but they will have a lot
more ifun to take fathers and brothers
along-their own brothers, also some
other girls' brothers.
The woman who toils like a slave
and obeys like a slave will be rewarded
like a slave.
A queer thing happened lately at
Atlantic City. Miss Elsie Bernard, a
strong and expert swimmer, was in the
water off the pier. She was perform
ing various water exploits, in one of
Swhich she threw up her hands. The life
saver, who is always present to watch
the swimmers, thought this motion of
Miss Bernard was a signal for help.
He snatched a baby, and threw it to
ward her with such force that be threw
himself along with it, and down be
went into the sea, head first. He
struck so hard that he was stunned
and sank instantly. As quickly Miss
Bernard, the magnificent girl swim
mer, dived after him. She did not
find him. came up to breathe and
dived again. The second time she
reached him, grasped him powerfully
and brought him to the surface. There
others relieved her of her burden and
quickly restored the half drowned man.
Thus a girl swimmer saved the life
saver.
The asting sebre!ary o the Bostoa
Demiocrati committee is a woman,
Miss Mary Meyer. She has been em
ployed in the Lemocratic headquarters
13 years and knows more of the details
of the office than any man does. In
I election times she has worked 48 hours
without stopping. Yet probably not
I more than one in ten of all the men
who know of her capability would be

purpose ru runulde of such brilliant
colors as far as tihe trtimiings go that I
they could be seen farther than the
wireless telegrnaih could reach. Itright
green and scarlet are put with the
white, anl sometimes eioth togethcr.
But the suit in the Illustration has
feather ed ~or1 braid In black around
the botto i. of the skirt in such a way
as to suggest hemstitching. This braid
is among the new kirds, and as muay
be seen It is ornamental at aI very low
cost. There are other colors besides
black.
The dress Is of white serge and of
thIe waterlproof kind. The waist difers
sonmewhat from the accepted idea of
what a senroing suit should be. This
Is a blouse with four rows of the braid
around thie lower part and a stitched
belt of scrre. Across the bust are
straps bound with dark blue suruab and
fastening with brass buttons. Across
the shoulders Is fastened a large Rum
chunda hlundlkerchief, with the center
of a dull blue and a border of deep
blue. ndil with some red and yellow
stripes along thie edges. This handker
chief Is fastened at the chest with two
brass buttons. and the rest Is left to
hang loose. It hangs in a point in the
back. The sleeves are bell and cuff
shape, and not so well adapted as full
bishop would be,. but then these are
newer. The hat Is of stitched felt and
velvet ribbon and a draping of white
lace Is drawn across the front. Caps
made of canvas are better liked for
salling, but we will suppose this young
lady to have gone ashore for some
powder to keep her complexion good.
All this forenoon I have devoted to
seeing the new styles in coats and
wraps for fall. Aside from the fancy
Lonls XV shape. with its fitted skirt
and frogged lapels and cuffs and the
long surtouts and capes for fine wear,
there are many common sense gar
ments, and they will be the ones often
est seen. There is the three quarter coat
made of kersey and other similar heavy
stuffs. all smooth surfaced, however.
One auto coat Is of drab kersey and
has the froirts straight down, with
pockets at the sides and two rows of
buttons down the front. All seams are
strapped and double stitched. In the
back these have a coat finish, with in- I
EZ LATEBT YACRTING COUTUIL
verted plaits, and buttons like those on
men'scoats. The collars are high. as they
were last season, and the sleeves nar
row bell shape. In fact, all the coats
have the same shape of sleeve, more or
less pronounced. The most of them
have turndown collars in man style,
with the revers. One very novel shape
Is long enough to reach to the hips
only, and is shaped slightly in the back
to fit the figure. Down each of the
three seams is a strap of the kersey,
and this is cut at the bottom to repre
sent a fleur-de-lis and is stitched three
times around. In front It is a simple
reefer shape. This design is repro
duced in castor, oxblood, brown, navy,
mode, pearl 'tan and black. All the
best styles are brought out in all the
season's colorings, so that every one
may be suited. Another odd style has
the reefer front, and the back is a com
bination of box shape and fitted form.
The side seams fit, but the back, which
is cut in two pieces, makes it a regular
box shape, with the little notches at
the sides. A yoke across the shoulders
In the back Is the novelty in one more
coat. The rest of the back Is in two
shaped pieces half fitting and trimmed
with narrow black soutache.
Some of the handsomest automobile
coats are made of real Irish frieze.
They are 42 inches long and lined with
satin. Stitching is the best trimming,
and velvet collars are almost obliga
tory. All are double breasted.
Short capes are made of black ker
sey and of melton. Almost all of them
are strap stitched and all have high
collars-flaring ones. There are cheviot
and other heavy cloth suits made with
a tailored blouse jacket, and from the
immense number of these we must be
sure that the outdoor bloose suit has
not been forgotten and will be popular
for the younger contingent at least.

she might have lost her rollicking tone
with the accession of responsibility. A
mother is almost always tiresomely
psychological when she talks of chil
dres, whether her own or some one
else's. She can rarely view them with
the disinterested, literary eye. In her
senior term at Smith college, about
two years ago, Miss Daskam began to
attract attention by her contribution to
The Youth's Companion and the New
Yofk Saturday Evening Post. She was
one of the ablest editors of The College
Literary Monthly that Smith's ever
had. After her graduation the Scrib
ners published a series of her sketches,
called "Smith College Stories," which
were deservedly popular with those
who like to know of scholastic life from
the point of vieW of the college girl.
BSince then The Atlantic Monthly, The
Century and Harper's have published a
great deal of her prose and verse, and
St. Nicholas has used a series of stories,
for which the French right of transla
tlon and publication has been asked by
publishers across the ocean. All this,
with another book issued by the Scrib
Sners, is a good deal for a woman, young
and a newcomer in literature, to have
achieved within two years. Miss Das
kam lives at Stamford, Conn., and is as
modest about her work as though her
spurs were yet to be won. Miss Das
kam is the descendant of an old Hugue
not family, the D'Askams, and on her
mother's side traces her descent back
to the Aldens of the Mayflower.
A recent recruit to the ranks of the
professional book reviewers is Miss
Anna Paret, who contributes several
pages of bright and pertinent remarks
on current literature to each issue of
Harper's Bazar. Miss Paret is the
sister of the lawn tennis champion,
J. Parmley Paret. Miss Paret was for
several years on the staff of the New
I York Herald. Miss Jeannette Gilder
and Miss Bertha Bunkle have won
eminent successes as reviewers. There
is probably in their special lines no
opinion that carries more weight than
those of the literary editors of The
Critic and the New York Tribune.
There would therefore seem to be a
Sfield for women as book reviewers.
Certainly today the majority of book
readers are women, and who so well
can gauge their taste for literature as
one of their own sex? Miss Paret has
intelligence and individuality, and her
criticisms so far have been a very
entertaining feature of the magazine
in which they appeared.
Every one who reads literary periodi
cals has admired the artistic photo
graphic studies of celebrities signed
Floride Green. Miss Green, a south
erner by birth and a Californian by
adoption, was encouraged by a famous
Paris and San Francisco photographer
to devote the skill which she had ac
quired as an amateur to the taking of
photographs for an income. She came
to New York city, opened a studio and I
eventually gained the patronage of the

We called attentin sine little time
ago to 411 exp rimi eI t ihat was to be
tried in the London parks. This was
the stocking of the tlow r 41s witlh
beautiful butterflies rais. d for tl e pur
pose from caterpillairs. The I in has
been tested in liuttersa iark andt
promises to he a uarked succi e. Some
8,Ai l cateritillars were plwed in a
small building, 14 feet by Io . t. like
a greenhouse. 'Tlhey were r' ered or
fresh cut nettles, and recently the
winged insects have been turned loose
at the rate of 400) a day.
The greatest trouble that has been
found with the success of the plan is
caused by the rascally English spur
row, who was quick to take advantage
of this source of food supply. At first
the windlows of the hatching shed were
left open, so that the buttertlies would
get out as soon as they were :able to fly.
The sparrows soon learned this and
waited for them just outside of the
window.
But, even In spite of these bird
nuisances, the experiment is announced
as being entirely satisfactory, and next
season the hatching will be tried again.
Here is a suggestion for some of our'
park officials, for no one will question
that a large number of beautiful but
terflies would do much to add to the
beauty of our public flower beds.-Bos

John G. Johnson, the noted corpora
tion lawyer of Philadelphia, would make
a poor writing master. Recently when
asked to make a statement regarding
one of his cases for a newspaper he
told the reporter that he would write
out a statement and send it to the
paper In the evening. This he did.
When the manuscript arrived, the story
was waiting for It. The statement
which Mr. Johnson had written was
of undoubted Importance and was as
undoubtedly written in choice English,
but no man on the staff of the paper
could read a word of it. Not one could
tell which was the top of the sheet.
The reporter who had solicited the
statement took the manuscript, got in
to a cab, hurried to Mr. Johnson's resi
dence and showed him the manuscript.
"Nope of us can read a word of that,"
he said. The lawyer laughed and look
ed at the writing.
"Now look here," he began, and then
he frowned. Then he scratched his
bead. "Well," he said, "I certaInly
wrote It, but I'll hwear I can't make
out a word of It. You go ahead and'
write as I dictate." And in that way
the paper got the story.-New York,

The three hundredth anniversary of
the settlement of English speaking
America is now but a few years dis
tant, reckoning that event from Jquesy
town. In 19 years it will be thr
centuries since the pilgrims landed at
Plymouth. A decade further along
and our own city will have completed
its third century. Still, however, when
we consider other civilizations which
have been incorporated with the Anglo
Baxon in the United States, Jamestown
and Plymouth and Boston must hide
the diminished heads of their antiquity
when Santa Fe and St Augustine are
mentioned.
Just when Santa Fe de San Fran
cesco de Asis was founded as a white
settlement by forcible conversion fron
a populous Indian pueblo the Spaniards
found on their first visit in 1542 re
mains for antiquarians to decide, but it
must be more than 300 years ago.
Santa Fe was certainly the capital of
the region in 1640, and the Spaniards
