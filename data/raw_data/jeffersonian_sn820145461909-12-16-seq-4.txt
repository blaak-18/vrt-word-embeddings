Summary of Events
Rumors are afloat from the Department of
State that Japan has an idea of a Nicaraguan
canal route and may have been in
Jingo sympathy with Zelaya. This tale
Alarms, appears very like a jingo yarn for
the purpose of excusing the United
States government'in its highhanded proceed
ings against President Zelaya and his govern
ment. At first it sounds as if it might be akin to
the stories of barbarities and tortures inflicted
upon Cannon and Groce before they were put
to death. It is easy to find some sort of a
story to serve as a motive after an act has
been committed, and Mr. Knox is now evi
dently trying to arouse the American people
to that sort of indignation which would rat
ify him in prosecuting his war against Ze
laya. Mr. Knox has not only his conduct to
justify in the eyes of Congress and the Ameri-
can people, but he has to satisfy
at least the technical provisions
of international law and is evi
lently casting about for ways to
do this without delaying the
well-set plan to obtain domina
tion in the Canal Zone.

Supreme Court
Bench caused by the death of
Justice Peckham has aroused al
most universal indignation. That
Mr. Taft should have passed
over hundreds, nay thousands,
of good men and capable, to se
lect a corporation hack who has
not had in years the shadow of
official reputation is an outrage
to decency. This man has been
the continuous pet of the Louis
ville and Nashville and other
Railroads, using their cars and
accepting their favors with a
reckless disregard of the posi
tion in which it placed him. He
might have been placed upon the
Supreme Bench before, but Mr.
Roosevelt turned him down as
unfit because of these very
things. Mr. Taft now takes
Lurton up and elevates him to
this high judicial office, where
he will be a fit associate and con
sort for the Wickershams, Dick
ersons and other corporation
henchmen who are now in
charge of this government. Lur

odious form of mugwump that
has been in politics in the last
couple of decades, being an ex-

gade Democrat, who is truckling to the Re

the railroad executives present that to treat
the people as customers is vital to the solution
of the railroad problem. This is drastic, radi
cal, revolutionary; its effect upon the people
would be demoralizing unless the change were
gradually made. From being treated as cul
prits to the point of receiving the considera
tion that customers in other lines obtain
would be too exhilarating. So Utopian is Mr.
Post’s scheme, we trust the railroads will go
slowly in adopting it, treating us first as cul
prits, then as undesirable citizens, later as
mere “suspects”, and finally extending to us
a certain tolerance without in anywise alter
ing the lordliness of their real attitude. Par
ticularly do we hope that none of the discom
forts attending women who travel will be
mitigated by any of the great systems. It
was a mistake to put a smoking-room on the
cars for the convenience of men; and a re
tiring-room for the mother, wfith several lit
tle children to be cared for, could not be as
suaged without inaugurating a tendency
toward a relaxation of the proper discipline
to be maintained. The seats should be as un
comfortable as possible, w'ith no earthly
chance for a lady to relax from a position
equivalent to sitting in the stocks. The cars
should be w r ell w r armed in summer and well
ventilated by icy drafts on the back of the
neck or on the ankles in winter. Any devia-
variously discussed, and

by Mr. George A. Post,
of New York, is worthy

that the administration worm would, at
length, turn against this iniquitous corporation.
