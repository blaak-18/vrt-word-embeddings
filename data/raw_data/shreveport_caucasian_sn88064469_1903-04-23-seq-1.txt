THE GRAND JURY.
CONVENED IN SPECIAL SESSION
i'P JU!)(;E LAND.
In>tructuins lx the Court-Report of
the Inquiry-The Matthcws Case
Still Shrouded in M\stery.
The grand jury, called into special
-easion hy His Honor. A. D. Land,
judge of the First Judicial District
Court, on the reconmendation of ,he
coroner's jury, who "urged a further
examin:.tion by the gtand jury" of the
Matthews murder, convened at 12
o'clock Monday. April 20.
In his charge to the grand jury, af
ter dwelling on the shocking tragedy.
the judge directed the grand jury to
"consider what connection, if any, the
man \Va.shington. who was killed on
April Ii, had with the murder of Mrs.
Matthews. If you find," he said. "that
he had no connection with said crime,
then you will proceed with your inves
tigation to the end that the real criminal
may be discovered.
"When a murder has been commit
ted," said Judge Land. "any officer or
individual may arrest, without a war
rant, any suspected person on 'reason
able cause of suspicion.' It is the duty of
an officer, in all cases of felony, to act
upon credible information or on indica
tions of guilt, known to him, and arrest
the suspected person at once. It has been
well said that 'it would block the wheels
of justice' if an officer could not do his
dutyt without ecing answerable, criminal
ly and civilly, in the event the evidence
should not sustain the suspicion.
"It is always one's duty to submit to
a lawful arrest, and forcible resistance
is a crime.
"The law is well settled that an officer
may use all necessary force to overcome
resistance to an arrest or to prevent the
escape of the party arrested. I have no
reasons to believe that the officers in
killing the man referred to went beyond
the strict line of their duty, eveh should
you find that the party arrested was in
fact innocent of the crime. Whether
there was 'reasonable cause for suspi
cion, and whether the killing was neces
sary to prevent the escape of the party
arrested is a matter for your considera
tion."
Having received the instructions of
the court, the grand jury retired to their
room, where they heard the statements
of several persons, including members
of Mrs. Matthews' family. It was about
5:30 o'clock in the afternoon when the
grand jury submitted their report, read
ing as follows:
To the Hon. A. D. Land. Judge of the
First Judicial District Court: The grand
jurors convened in special session under
the order of the court beg leave to sub
mit the following report:
'We have investigated the Matthews
murder case as far as the testimony be
fore us will permit us to go, and at pres
ent have no finding, to present to the
court.
The mystery surrotnding this case
shows the necessity of blood hounds in
ferreting. out crime, and we recommend
that the police jury and city council of
Shreveport offer a reward of $5oo, $250
each, for the arrest and conviction of
the party or parties guilty of the mur
der of Mrs. Alice Matthews, in the city
of Shreveport on the morning of April
I, Igo3.
HTacing completed the labors before
us, we beg leave to adjourn, subject to
the order of the court.

Foreman of Grand Jury.
The grand jury's session was accord
ingly adjourned subject to call.
INVESTIGATION UNSATISFAC
TORY.
If there are citizens in this community
who expected the grand jury to unravel
this murder mystery, we must admit
candidly that we are one of the excep
tion. The grand jury was in session less
than five hours, when it was expected
their sitting would occupy at least one
day. The atrocity and the perplexity of
this crime precluded haste. It was such
an inquiry as required careful, persist
ent search. The speed of the grand jury
is inniarked contrast to the coroner's
jury, which exhausted every means at
their command to develop a clue. The
grand jury had before them, through
persons summoned, about the same in
formation which is familiar to the pub
lic, and there were persons who should
have been heard who were not called or
summoned to appear." Indeed it may be
said that what was developed :s in part
in keeping -with the clear theories ad
vanced by the €aucasian, and one may
assume that the g-land jury did not ha -e
in their investigation the opportunity of
developing the case to a more direct aid
satisfactory conclusion, and were guided
by such information as was submitted to
them and which is famili'r t wspa
,petr r_"e.in Shreetort. Of the sev
Ad ~ -~2y
i i.,r ie npr ,d some members of the
gru;l i;ry a:-d it is the story of the ne
grl, iioma' X.vli overheard two men
talking near her window. discussing the
murder. on the night of the crime. dur
Sini whi rich oe of the men answering to
a query said he "had struck hard enough
to kill." This story has been exploited
and is one of the many suggested in
minds distorted by unpleasant dreams.
THE CONCLUSION OF THE JURY.
As will be noted, the grand jury has
announced that "we have investigated
the Matthews murder case as far as the
testimony before us will permit us to go,
and at present have no finding to report
to the court." In this respect the grand
iurv's conclusion is as the coroner's
jury, with the exception that the cor
oner's Jury was more persistent in their
search for clues. It was one of the cor
oner's jury who located Ed Porter, who
was reported to have been shot and
killed as the murderer, and who is in
the active flesh today.
Having failed to develop the case, it
is possible that this tragedy will go on
the record of great crimes which are
unsolved, and perhaps the perpetrator of
this diabolical deed may shield himself
from the clutches of justice and the law
until he shall have gone beyond the
grave. In this case there are peculiari
ties which, when analyzed deliberately,
are,startling, but. reason as one may.
the motive as the link is perplexing. But
as we said at the beginning, the grand
jurors acting on the information before
them, had no clue and groped under dif
ficulties 'erhaps beyond their control.
THE .RANI) JURY ON BLOOD
HOUNDS.
In their report to the court the grand
jiry suggest the necessity of blood
hounds, which, in some cases, would
prove of great value in hunting a fleeing
criminal, but blood hounds could not ac
complish the impossible. The blood
hounds may be ever so thorough and sa
gacious in training as to give the most
gratifying results in fields, more or less
open and clear, where once on the scent
they could follow the trail to the end
and capture, but the best dogs would be
of little value in trailing a criminal
whose tracks have been covered by
scores of people, called to the scene of
murder through curiosity., Dogs, unas
sisted, in a city, could do little good,
and therefore the question of blood
houndstshould be considered in a con
servative sense. The first act on the part
of the legal authorities when a murder
has been committed should be to hasten
to the scene, assume charge of the prem
ises, permit no one to go in or out, and
ot secure then and there all the informa
tion which may be obtained readily, but,
if there is no restraint and everybody be
permitted to go in and out, how can the
best dogs find, take and keep the trail?
THE DISTINCT AND FORCEFUL
WORDS OF THE JUDGE.
In his charge to the grand jury Judge
Land said: "It is always one's duty to
submit to a lawful arrest, and and forci
ble resistance is a crime."
Truer or more forceful words could
not have been uttered, but we do not
think their interpretation to mean that
because a man, arrested or about to be
arrested. should try to flee and to escape
should be killed outright. If carried into
execution literally, almost any man
would be at the mercy of an officer who,
if not conservative, moderate and pru
dent in his action could shoot and kill,
on the pretext of "attempting to escape."
It will be conceded that when a person
is suspected of guilt and is trying to
escape, thlat the officer of the law should
"get his man, but in this enlightened
he ccntury when we are bloastfi:l (f our ci-
e- ilization. we could not construe and in
n iterpret this declaration to mean that the
Ie lman seeking to escape should be killed.
r- when he may he crippled and taken

;h must he left to the representative of the

is. will not shoot to kill except in an emer
'. gency or in defense of his life, when in
as peril. We are led to these reflections on
d the belief that an impression has been
1e created in justification of the killing of
o, any man resisting arrest or fleeing from
rt an officer, when that man could be shot
id in the legs or feet or otherwise crippled
's and taken and not killed. It is a well
r- known fact, substantially established by
ir repeated demonstrations, that some men,
r- especially negroes, will run from an of
o ficer, thoughtless of his peril in fleeing,
dt which he can not control, and therefore
n to not kill a man running from an of
ficer and wanted for a trivial affair, but
it to cripple him if necessary must suggest
n itself as humane in the exercise of an
-e official function.
)f THE OFFICERS JUSTIFIABLE.
If Although Judge Land in his charge
w directed the grand jury to inquire as to
ie the killing of Albert Washington, and
i- whether there was "reasonable cause for
. suspicion,' and "whether the killing was
g necessary to prevent the escape of the
it party arrested, it will be noted that the
d grand jury in their report made no allu
*e sion thereto. Doubtless through inadver
f ance, but as was said in the Caucasian
at the time of the unfortunate homicide,
the officers were justifiable in law, under
the circumstances, as they then had
d every reason to believe that the fleeing
d man was the murderer striving to es
d cape.
g REWARD SUGGESTED.
The grand jury has recommended that
d the police jury and the city council offer
t- a reward each of $25o--total $5oo-for
;t the apprehension and conviction of the
is criminal. The State should also add a
it liberal reward to stimulate in this re
d sult, but perhans rewards regardless of
e amount may never lead to the unravel
t ing of this crime, which, like others, are
y mysteries still.
A SINGULAR CASE.
Without mentioning names it may be
j, recalled that not many years ago there
d lived in this city a family in whom there
were two grown daughters. The family
-t moved to Texas. One night in summer a
r white man was seen in the room occu
n pied by these two sisters who slept in
t- the same bed. In the room was a lamp
d burning brightly. One of the sisters on
t_ seeing the man grappled with him while
t, her sister ran into the room adjoining,
i in which was sleeping their mother, who
te had been aroused by the screams and
? the turmoil. Almost in a twinkle after
L the sister had reached her mother, who
clasped her in her arms, there was heard
;e the report of a pistol shot and this young
:o woman was dead. The man fled and
i- evaded arrest, there being seemingly no
clue, and although the sister spared had
Id held this man and struggled with him
)t face to face ,no information, not a clue,
st was ever obtained to this criminal. And
>e there are crimes so peculiar that it would
ie seem senseless to attempt to unravel
to them, as for instance the famous Still
In well case in Missouri which some years
o, ago agitated the whole continent, and
.- recently the Burdick and Pennell mys
II, teries which have defied solution by the
best detective talent.
,n The Stillwell case was remarkable for
to its peculiarities, which were distinctive.
Id He was wealthy. Ile was murdered with
d an ax to hours after he and his wife had

well married a t)r. - (name ,'n not
be recalld I ~ ithin a .war fromo the date
of the crime, the, agitation was renewIl
with vigor, and the couple havire re
moved to San F-ancisco, led the Ch)it
icle of that city to an investigation
which cost thousands of dollars. lTh1
couple were arrested and returned to
Missouri, and after lingering in jat"
about a year, secured a change 4 venue
from their county and were acquitted bt
a jury.
Other cases as peculiar, almost paral
lels of the Matthews case. could be cite4
where the ax was the weapon. used pur
posely to mislead and divert suspicion,
and in these cases there has been little
accomplished, but yet "murder will out"
and some day what is now perplexing
and enshrouded in gloom may be made
plain.
MRS. ESTELLE RUMBLY SHEP
PARD.
On Sunday. April I9. at her residence
in this city, Mrs. Estelle Rumbly Shep
pard, devoted wife of C. F. Sheppard,
died, aged 30 years. A lingering illness,
hopeful at times with the promises of
recovery, sapped a constitution already
impaired, and therefore neither the skill
of the best physician nor the untiring
care of her loved ones could avail.
Heaven is her reward. On Sunday after
noon the burial took place in the Green
wood cemetery, where a large concourse
of her friends attested the esteem in
which this most estimable lady was held.
On July I to 1o the Cotton Belt Route
will sell round trip tickets to Pueblo,
Colorado Springs and Denver at rate of
