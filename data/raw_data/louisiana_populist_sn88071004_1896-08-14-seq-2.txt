Mr. Bryan's trip from his home
at Lincoln, Neb., to New York,
where he was formally notified last E
Wednesday, of his nomination, I
was nothing short. of a triumphal I
march. Thousands met him at

The Situation.
Unless Bryan receives the united
Populist vote there is no question
of his certain defeat. The inso
lent talk of certain I)emocratts that
the Populists will vote the Demno
cratic ticket any how, with or with
out recoanition, is a serious hun
o Ider. The more conservative and
0 sensible Democrats are fully aware
of this. They want Bryan elected,
and they do not want a union of
the silver vote made impossible by
the foolish talk of the "smart
Alicks" in their own party. Al
ready there is a big reaction in fa
vor of middle-of-the-road Populist
electors, and the Populists in nmany
of the States are ripe for revolt
against anything else. If this hap
pens Bryan's defeat is assured, and
the Democrats will have only them
selves to blame.
Now that the goldhug Demo
crats are nominating their own tick
et and thus throwing the Bryan
Democrats entirely upon the Pop
ulists and Silver Republicans for
hep to elect Bryan, it should be
plainer than ever to the Dememo
cratic organization that the union
of the silver forces should be made
in earnest, and without deception
on either side.
We hope that the Democrats will
come to their senses before it is too
late; we beg our Populist friends
not to be over hasty in their actions,
and to be more careful in their
speech than those ill tempered, ill
advised Democrats who seem to be
doing their best to elect McKinley.
The Populists have aske I for
but little recognition of their great
party-the Vice-Presidency. For
that position they have put for
ward one of their best men-an
idol in the party--the ONLY man
who can hold all the rank and file
to the ticket. They cannot and
will not accept less.
The only hope therefore of an
honorable union lies in the with
drawal of Mr. Sewall from the
ticket, which we hope he will have
the good sense to see and patriot
ism to comply with.
The action of the party in this
State has in no sense forestalled or
embarrassed any action looking to
unity, as has been charged by the
lyib press reports.
There has as yet been no confer
ence between Chairman Jones and
Chairman Butler regarding the
mode of co-operating by the Pop
ulist and Democratic parties, and
the old party press reports con
corning what each of them favors
are not worthy of belief. The
Associated Press is anxious to de
feat free silver, and the lies its
agents send out are equal to any-.
thing Munchausen or Annanias
could produce were they alive to
day.
SProposition. C
Just as the People's party con- a
vention was about to adjourn last a
week, Judge J. T" Watkins came ii
forward sad stated to the conven- v
tion that be was authorised by the u
chairman of the Democratic State
central committee, also by the tl
chairman of the campaign com-,
mittee, to offer th. People's party s
adivision of electors in order to
secure a joint electoral ticket.
Judge Gunby replied on behalf a
of the convention, in efect: That I
in obedIee totheb . Louis con- in
ve-tion of the People's party, this o
convention was supporting Bryan g

Glase Ilousume
ed There are a great many insuilting
n thlngs being said alMnit the Popu
lists by some l)emocratic papers
"- with the palpable intention of so
at exasperating the Populists that
o- they will retuse to go to the polls
h- to vote for IBryan. These tpapers
n- are evidently interested in defeat
ing free silver and are also inter
1( ested in Hanna's hoodle. When
re Hanna can tind a lealing D)emo
d, cratic manager who loves bIoodle
,f better than harmony of the silver
forces, there is little doubt that
'y such party will be well supplied,
rt and that he will shoxw great arro
1- gance, do his best to belittle and
p- prevent recognition of the Popu
it lists, and, as far as he can, pre
vent the consumation of the union
'y of the silver forces. So when you
It see a big )emocratic manager op
posing Populist recogmnition, you
id will see an illustration of how
_ "money talks"--Hlanna's money.
It should be borne in mind that
- Sewall has a "barT'l as well as
- Ilanna. Many uncalled for things
n have been said about the "middle
of the road" Populists, which we
are thoroughly convinced were
r without one shadow of foundation.
x But those Western men who were
- so anxious to sacrifice the People's
n party organization to Democracy,
and the little so-called Populist pa
per that advocated it and even now
n has Sewall's name at the head of
its column where Watson's ought
II to be, has not been accused of com
p ing in contact with Sewall's "bar'l;"
Is oh, ho, And how about the gallery
at the convention that was pack
º ed with Sewall shouters and clack
ir ers ? And how about the com
11 plete organization of the Sewall
e forces on the floor of the Conven
tion, as many as 20 different men
approaching and imploring us to
r vote for Sewall, while not one so
t licited our vote for Watson, or in
r the interest of the middle of the
road movement 1 Any evidence
of Sewall's "barT'l about that f
Hanna's is not the only bar'l, and
n the only evidence of his successful
e use of it will be seen in those D)em
j ocratic leaders who love oxxxlle
better than union and success of the
silver umovement.-Virginia Sun.
r We commend the above to our
neighbor, the Enterprise, and our
e Shreveport Dailies,
It Was a Solemn Contract.
From Atlanta Commercial, (Dem.)
Whether Senator Jones agreed in
so many words to take Sewall out of
the race in consideration of the
Populist endorsement of Mr. Bry
an, is not material.
There are agreements expressed
and implied-in politics as well as
in law.
Why did Senator Jones attend
the Populist convention ? He was
not a delegate. On the other hand,
he was chairman of the Democrat
Ic national committee, ard his par
ty had already nominated a ticket.
lie clearly did not happen in St.
Loui4, as is intimated in today's
telegraphic news. He went there
with the pre-determined idea of in
ducinz Populist endorsement of
one or both of the Chicago nomi
nees. It was a visit full of design,
and it is not material whether Sen
ator Jones attended the convention
itself. He was in daily conference j
with Senator Allen and other Pop c
ulist leaders. t
Each understood the other, or t
thought they did, and together they I
were working for the success of g
silver. c
What right had Senator Jones
urge the nomination of Bryan d
after Watson was put on the ticket, ,
if he did not intend to use his in- p
fluences towards taking Sewall out
of the race i Mr. Bryan had tele
graphed hIs desire for the endorse
ment of the full Chicago ticket.
Why was this information with- n
held from the Populist convention S
It is known that the Democratic
ohairman and the Populist chair- k
man conspired to suppress Mr.
Bryan's telegram. Why, unless
Senator Jones felt that it would
defeat his endorsement 1
The very fact that Senator Jones,
who was representing the Demo- t
cratic party at St. Louis, withheld i
this important news from the con
vention with which he was trading,
is proof as'clear as anything can be
that is not expressed in words, that p
the action of the Populists in nomi- B
nating Watson, while not all that
he had hoped for, was a satisfacto
ry compromise,
Senator Jones gave his implied 1
endorsement to the nollmlinlition of
11 at son whien he iiermiitt 3l Mr.
Ilry.n's name t<o go before the cn
r* vention wvhile his the,,r:tu wa': oll
so riol in the dep!,ths of his in hie
at pocket. This is Ithe only honora
r1 Ile view to take of it, anl, as a
it- )ennaratic paper, that has worok
r- e(l for silver, the Commercial feels
en Ibound by the contract.
- Senator Jones had no right to
Sexpect the Populists to make all
at the concessions. lie did not ex
d, poet it and his actions show that
o- this was not intended.
"l Sewall should dehcline if he is at
heart for silver. This is the best
in way to insure success. If he
>u doesn't decline the Populists should
P- have fair representation on the
u election ticket of each State, and
" it should Ie so arranged that the
man securini the majority of the
poplll:ir tote in Democratic States
Bt he made vice-president by the elec
Is toral college. The majority of the
' whole vote will not do. It is radi
le cally unfair.

Talk about them crucifying
r Jesus Christ on Calvary!
r For you always are denying
Mis'ries of humanity.
At the throne of grace you're
kneeling.
Clinging to the altar horns,
Telling Christ, with contrite feeling,
All about His crown of thorns.
But the toilers all around you
Wear a thorn-crown on their
brow;
Do their suff'rngs iot confound
you ?
Are they not the Christs of now ?
Are you ore of Pilate's soldiers,
s Platting crowns of cruel thorn
For the weary, half-fed toilers,
Who are bleeding, bruised and
torn I
Oh, you servile, cringing, creatures!
What does Christ care tor your
cries ?
While depicted on your features
Are the truths ench one denies :
Truths well known to every to
neighbor;, tl
Truths that to the winds are C
told- ii
Platting thorns for brow of labor, r
Like they did for Christ of old. C

r
This funny and instructive book
tells in a most humorous way how
the Angel of Liberty took Grover
e Cleveland from the White House
in the dead of night, and left him,
ragged and hungry, in Oklahoma
City, to tramp home. Grover's
trial's and tribulations as a tramp
are most ludicrously related, and
his conversations with farmers
and laboring men about the silver
question are very instructive.
Everybody Should Read It.
It contains 176 paos of laugh
provoking matter, and 40 full-pare
illustrations of Cleveland as a
tramp.
