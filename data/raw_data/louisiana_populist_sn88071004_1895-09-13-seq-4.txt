Teo, Why N0eer
The police commissioners of New
York are seriously considering the
advisability of arming the police
force with a newly invented rubber
club. It is said that this club will
knock a man silly as q(uick as the old
wooden one. without danger of frac
turing his skull. Why not give the
police sandbags and be done with it?
They have many advantages over
clubs of any sort.

STORY OF PRINCE
(By Lieut. R. A. Swift, 1. S. A.)
ANUEL DIAZ cam
and looked down a
me as I lay boun,
and helpless on th
ground.
"Gringo dog:" h
Ssnarled, showini
his white teeth.
Then he kicker
me contemptuously
"You would no
dare to do that if
were free, evel
though you are in the camp of you
own ladrone followers!" I cried, hoping
to arouse him still more.
He hissed some words I did not catch
"You are the most pitiful coward I
has ever been my fortune to meet!"
continued tauntingly. "All greaser:
are cowards! I fought you like a man
and now you mean to hang me like i
cur!"
"SI, senor," he returned exultantly
"like a cur you hang! You keel four o:
my men. Car-r-ramba!"
"Only three." I corrected. "My dog
disposed of the fourth."
"The log is dead; you will soon be so
I give you a little while more to thini
how you like it to hang."
Then he walked away toward the spol
where several of his bandit follower,
were gambling.
I had heard how brutally Diaz. the
outlaw, treated those unfortunate
enough to fall into his hands, and I
feared the fate in store for me.
He believed me a spy-an officer ol
the law.
I could expect no mercy.

Prince, my dog, and they led the out
laws to my camp.
My first warning was when five or sil
dirty curs came yelping down upon us
I clutched my rifle as I saw the
Mexicans swarming over the ridge.
My command to halt rang out on the
morning air. and then they opened fire
with rifles and revolvers.
I had no protection, and so I stood
up there in the open, one to twenty,
and worked my Winchester to the best
of my ability.
Prince made a terrible scattering
among the curs that had attacked him.
He did not seem to consider them big
enough game for him, and so, flinging
them to the right and left, he broke
through and went leaping at the throat
of a man who had fallen and rolled
down the bank to within a short dis
tance of us.
Prince had the fellow by the throat
In a moment.
In vain the poor wretch tried to tear
himself free.
His life was soon ended.
I brought down three others with my
rifle.
Then a bullet scored my skull.
The Wincshester dropped from my
nerveless fingers. I sunk helpless to
the ground.
I saw them rush upon me with ex
ultant yells, and I knew wheh they
bound me securely.
Now I was doomed to die by hang
Ing-Dias himself had said it.
I tried to taunt him Into killing me
in a passion, but my efforts were in
vain.
He left me and sat down, where he
could watch the men who were gam
bling on the big scarlet blanket they
had spread on the ground.
I saw him light a cigarette and puff
"HURRY, PRINCE, HURRY."
at it in a lasy way, seeming to have
forgotten me.
I knew it was a part of his scheme
ci torture.
He would soon find time to remind
me that my minutes were numbered.
They said my dog was dead-poor old
Prince.
I turned on my side, choking beck the
groan that rose in my throat.
And then I saw somethling that gave
me a start.
A short distance away lay Prince,
stretched on the ground as he had fall
en; but his eyes were wide open, and I
would have sworn he moved his tail
a bit when I looked at him.
"Prlnce!" I whispered, Just loud
enough for my voloe to reach him.
Again that movement of his tail, and
his eyes suddenly lomed.
One of the outlaws was approach
ing.
"Senor," he said, as he came up, "the
chlef tell me to say you have ten mln
ate more to Ive."
'"Tell him I shall hlive to see him
hang!" I retraned. a sudden strange
sensation of dealanoe comelng over me.

fiercely than before. I felt that they
soon might be trying to cut each other's
throat.
What an opportunity for escape!
If my hands and feet were free!
But a short distance away lay mn
Winchester.
How I longed to have it in my hands
e and be able to use it then and there!
A sudden thought came to me.
I turned on my face.
Prince licked my hands, which 'ere
bound behind my back.
"Chew it, boy--chew it!" I panted.
"Set me free!"
He did not understand at first, but I
am sure the truth that my hands were
helpless by the cords, finally dawned
on him, for he actually gave a nibble
at my bonds.
Then I encouraged him.
He seemed to understand that was
what I desired.
Immediately he set about gnawing
at the rope in a way that seemed to
promise a hasty release for my hands.
Two of the gambling Mexicans had
arisen to their feet and were confront
Ing each other, daggers in hand.
Diaz was watching them calmly, still
puffing at his cigarette.
Some of the others were urging them
on.
"Hurry. Prince-hurry!" I whispered.
Without making a sound he chewed
away at the cord.
At last, just as the quarreling out
laws were trying to stab each other to
death. I felt the rope part!
My hands were free!
I did not sit up, but lay on my side
and drew up my legs so I could work at
the bonds that held my feet.
I soon succeeded in my desperate ef
forts.
Free--I was free!
Still I did not rise.
With all the caution I could com
mand. I wormed my way toward the
spot where my rifle lay.
I secured it.
Down the slope I backed, while the
duel to the death between the two out
laws was going on.
Prince followed. and not one of all
our foes saw us creep out of the camp
not a sleeping dog stirred.
W got away, and once out of sight,
we made all haste to put a long dis
tance between us and our enemies.
I knew they would attempt to trail
us with their dogs, and so I was forced
to take to running water to deceive
them, and, in doing this, I carried
Prince in my arms, big. heavy fellow
though he was, with my Winchester
slung across my back.
It was two years before I saw Man
uel Diaz again, and then I had the
pleasure of attending his execution in
Guadalupe, Sonora.
He was hanged. Before he swung
into eternity I reminded him that I had
promised to live to see that day, and
had kept my word.
He smiled and replied that I owed
my life to a dog that knew far more
than any gringo he had he had ever
seen.
He died "game," which is saying a
great deal for a Mexican.
Prince lived but a few days after
aiding me to escape from the outlaws.
His wound proved fatal.
Far In the lonely heart of the Gila
mountains I made his grave, and there
I buried the truest, noblest comrade it
has ever been my fortune to know.
Poor old Prince!
PRINTERS' INK.
A pleasant ad, like a pleasant face, is
is looked at twice.
The more you pay for space, the more
careful you should be in filling it.
The business that is not advertised
can run along for a time, so can a dog
with three legs.
The loudest voice is the easiest heard.
and the biggest ad, best displayed, at
tracts attention quickest.
Advertising is a feeder to business.
Never stop. Diet your business occa
sionally, but never starve It.
"Let me but write the ads of a firm
and I care not who pays its bills,"
would be an appropriate motto for some
ad-smiths.
The circular ik the rifle of the sharp
shooter, which, if well-aimed, picks off
a straggling soldier occasionally; but
the well constructed newspaper adver
tisement is the Gatling gun of publicity
that mows all before it.
The merchants who have shows their
enterprise by advertslaing right along
through the dark days of adversity,
crop failure and relief goods, are the
ones who will first feel the warm rays
of the rising sun of prosperity.
On Broadway the signs that are en
