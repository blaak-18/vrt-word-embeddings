WHO BUYS VOTES,
And Where the Money Comes
From for Both Oid Parties.
r (Time just bIefore the election.)
(()hi man.) Well the infernal
r republicans have got k_2,(o , to use
in this county to heat us. If seoie
thing is not ,I 'ne to down the mon
ey ,,ower, this gov(rnment is gone.
j What do you mean, pa! Gone
how
W1Vhy. I mean no governlent can
stand when it gets s') corrupt.
WI hat do you mean by corrupt?
Why, a government is corrupt
when voters sell their votes for
money.
Who furnishes this money, pa '
Why. they get it from New
'York.
From whom did they get it?
Why from the money power, of
c~urse.
How did the money power get
s much money,<
Why they got it ?
But how did they get it?
Well they are the blenficiaries
of unjust laws.
What isa Ibeneficiary?
I mean they get the benefit of
such laws.
What laws ?
Why the class laws that have
been passed for the last thirty years.
What do you mean by class laws f
I mean laws passed solely in the
interest of these rich scoundrels
who are exploiting the people.
Exploiting them how, pa?
Why my son, there are living in
the east mostly a lot of wealthy
men who, taken collectively, ccn
stitute what is known as the "mon
ey power." By Iribery and a
corrupt use of mincy, they get
,laws passed that enable them to
form monopolies and trusts to rob
the people.
Why don't they put them in jail?
Oh, they can't.
Who can't?
Why the authorities.
Can't they put robbers in jail I
Oh, yes; little ones have to go,
but the great robbers go free.
Why don't they imprison the
great ones.
They can't, they bribe the courts
in such a way as to escape.
To go back a little pa, I wan't
to know why people way off in
New York should send money to
Indiana? What difference does it
make to them how Indiana goes?
Oh, they want it to go republi
can.
Dcn't they ever send any money
to make Indiana go democratic ?
Ahe--ah--say you go to work
now.
But I want to know.
Well, to be frank with you they a
do, but don't say anything about it.
When did they send money to r
the demccrat I
Hush up now, I'm busy.
But I want to be posted in these a
things. May be I'll be a
Well they sent money in 1892.
How much pal
I don't know just how much,(
but a good many thousand dollars.
How was it used?
It was sent to the different coun
ty central committees. Some eoun- c
ties got more, some lesas. Some'
counties only get a few hundred,
dollars while other counties get as 1
moay t~d)uah -
lnt how was it mad i
If I mIust tell you, it was to buy t
rote.
Did the democrat. ever get any r
monqy before 18920 - t
Ob, ~yes, moreor less for yeu&ars. t
And the repuhlicans too, pal 9
Te, cooknmad them, they gene- t
ally-get more tim we do.
Of whob does this conty e-oe
trl nommittee cormistf
Itismhluot always naade up o t
I)o the eastern men send the
Smoney ;lir(.ct to the c. unties?
No, it is sent to the state central
cominitte-e. ly them to the coui
ties. Fr.nii there it goes to the
various town.hij, and wards.
It is lt range I never heard of
this .before, . 1,a
,Not s(, v-,ry if yv )i will consider
that it is alwayi s put into the hands
of .:anlid:ites n hi are more inr t r
(sted in the result than any on'"
elsce. 'Yon Iht they will never tell.
Iu!t 'a. who takes the initiative'
I)o these rich ea"sterners send out
the money voluntarily, and say
here take this ini ,nev
Oh, no, no. The state commit
tee, after a careful canvas~s of the
:ituation, sends o1ne o(r more of its
em!)ers to New York to lay the
matter before the national c ,nunit
tee and get the miinev.
But ' hy, p1a, does the money
iowe'r, :as you call it, contribute to
ixoth parties in the states.'
Tut, tut. I didn't say all the
states.
But don't they send money into
all the states as they d9 in Indiana?
N-), such st:ate: as Vermont,
Maine, or Texas (on't get any.
Why not ?
As a general thing the doubtful
states are the ones that get the
nmoney. You see. the appeals for
I money are made by the candidates
themselves. They are afraid they
will be beaten if they don't have
mo,ney to buy votes with.
I thought the Australian lallot
law was passed to prevent the buy
ing of votes.
Ah, my son, it was passed to
lull the suspicions of 'men who
were getting disgusted with the
oplin buying of votes, and who
threatened to bolt the old party
tickets.
Really, dces it not make buying
votes a crime?
Yes, but the cunning fellows so
framed the law that in order to get
the buyer into jail the seller would
have to go also. This makes the
law a dead letter, as no man will
incriminate himself in orler to im
prison some one else. If the poli
ticians had wanted to stop the buy
ing of votes, which they didn't,
they could have done so in a day,
by making the law so the seller
could inform on the buyer without
dankr to himself.
What assurance, pa, have the
rich beneficiaries as you call them
)f class laws, that this money they
sen.l here will be honestly used.
Excuse me, I don't mean h ,nestly
used. But applied to the purpose
for which it is intended.
Every assurance in the wotid, as
the men who are to use it are the
candidates themselves, or men who
will receive fat offices by appoint
mont if not candidates. Even if
the men who received it should
rocket it the result would be the
same to the men who gave it.
How do you make that out ?
Because the party leaders will
still be under obligations to the
fonners, and they will deliver the
goods just the same.
Deliyver what gods pa?
Well you see it is this way. The I
county central committee, or
"courthouse ring," always dictates
who shall be nominated for the I
legislature, and he is the man who i
lelivers the goods. In other 1
words, he votes as these rich men ,
tell him to on bills that affect their 1
interests. For instance, the rail-i
roads in this state don't pay more t
than one-fourth as much tax as c
theyoughtto pay. Neitherdo the
street car lines, nor the telegraphs, c
helephones, or expres cumpanies. j
Well some honest member has t
dipped into the legislature unbe- t
nowa to the ripg, and so he in- a
â¢rodues a binl to make these cor- e
poratiomn pay maushia propor- 1
tion as the farmers and little prop
erty owners pay. 'lhis gives the
I melars a li:L!tchance to lay with their
vote. for the help they got at the
elect ion.
Hlow, pa?
By uvting against the hill.
But yiu s.irl this money to ibuy
votes with ca1e frolll the. le:at.
And so it didl, and these mten are
from the east who (,%\n the rail
troads, eh'.
)Don't In liana 1:men (ewn themn
No, in many c(iases the stock and
h' ,nls are owned l I, E.nglishmnen.
But pa. I can't se~e Vet why lthese
eastern caipitalists I l, seni mI nin
ey to both parties.
VWell, you see, they don't know
just exactly how the election will I
go. so to be on the safe side they
-rive to) lxth parties, then they are
..feo, whichever wins.
But pa, how do they evade the
Australian I,allot law that we are'
told is so strict.
Easy enough my son, when all
the electi.nÂ· machinery is in the
hands of the men who wish to
evade it. They botlh buy votes
one way or the other, and each
party knows it. Both are equally
guilty, so no prosecutions follow.
The buying is more secret, so this
lulls the suspicions of the goody
goody fellows, which is all the law
was intended to do.
Imn't both parties demand a free
ballot and a fair count?
Yes.
Yet they both knIow each other
to be guilty of fraud ?
Yes.
And they both know they know
it?
Yes.
Then why say so much about it ?
This is another sop thrown to
the church members and Sunday
school teachers and women, who
are innocent as lambs, so far as
election methods go.
Now pa, ycu are a Christian, i
honest man and
Oh, well, they all do it.
You are a hard working farmer, I
too.
'W'ell what of it?
What of it ? Why don't youn ex
pose this fraud and venality and
corruption and
Oh come now, I'm sorry I told
you anything. Besides I'm a can
didate.
Now, pa, let's sum up a little.
You go to work now, I'm busy.
In a minute. N-w then this is a
republican form of government
where every man has a free vote,
and all express a willingness to let
the majority rule. In fact anarchy
must prevail in a republic if the'
Majority don't rule. The morning I
of the election comes. The voters, I
without let or hindrance, should 1
go to the polls and vote for their <
choice of the men to serve them.
The votes should be honestly count
ed in sight of any one who chooses
to see them counted. The ones re- j
ceiving the most votes should be lI
(leclared elected, and should go
and serve faithfully the whole peo
ple in whatever capacity they were
elected to serve. If a legislator
he should watch with a jealous eye
every interest of his constituents. I
Now, what are the actual, awful,
frightful facts. These candidates
instead of allowing a fair election
both send for money to a hostile
enemy, to bribe and debauch their
weak and poverty stricken neigh
bors. In order to get the money
they promise to serve not theirJ
constituent., but every interest
directly opposed to those of their
constituents. In otherrords, as
pay for this money they prass laws
that allow thes merciless corpora
tions to rob ther friends; first, by
-__xtoro burges; second, by
exempting them from taxation. J
This mas them rich and power- a

Hon. Lyman Trumbull.
We have just returned from an
hour's conversation with Hlon. Ly
man Trumbull, who is now in the
I city on business in the supreme
court. Mr. Trumbull is eighty
one years old, one of the greatest
jurists this country ever prodluced,
anl is to-day the nestor of his pro
fession. We wish every laboring
man or friend of labor could have
1listened to his words. This grand
old man far beyond the time of
life when personal ambition or
private gain could prompt such ac
tion, has stepped squarely to the
front, andl warned the great plain
people of the impending danger
which threatens them through the
unlawful encroachments of corpo
rate power. He had the courage
to denounce the greed and avarice
of the are, and demand justice
and equality for the poor and dis
tressed. He declares the action
of President Cleveland in sending
troops into Illinois as an act of
usurpation. He also declared Gov.
Altwood was right in his position
upon that subject. Mr. Trumbull
fears a revolution in the near fu
ture unless the present system of
distributing the fruits of labor is
changed. In fact, he is in hearty
sympathy with the populist move
ment in Ibehalf of labor, and re
joices that his speech has been well
received by the labor element, and
has provoked so much discussion.L
