HIS was iMr. Car
1 ter's third year
in eebraska.
lie had got
tired of his
small fartM In
Ohio, with its
sla 1 ow returns;
and when there
came to -him
what he regard
- ed as a good
opporttunity to
sell it, he lost
tio time in clos
 ing the bar
gain. He in
vested his money and all that resulted
from' the sale of his farming imple
ments and household goods in a quar
ter-section of land in western Nebras
ka, giving, as everybody did, a mort
gage on the farm for the balance
which he was unable to pay down.
Both he and his wife had a great an
tipathy to giving a mortgage, but
there was no other way; and then it
was not so large but that in three
years they could pay it off-perhaps in
two, if they should have extra good
crops. At all events, they would be as
economical in every way as possible
and pay it off at the earliest practic
able day.
There was a small house on -their
place when they went there, new, and
built purposely for the buyer; two
rooms and a kitchen, with a loft. in
which a person could sleep, though
under the middle of the roof only
could one stand upright. iut they re
garded it as only a temporary affair,
{
Ok:TTIO TIHE OROLUND IN RF.ADITES5.
submitting cheerfully to their cramped
quarters, but never losing sight of the
plan to build themselves a home as
soon as there was money enough to
pay off the hateful mortgage.
By the third year their clothing, not
too abundant when they came, began
to need replenishing in every direction.
Some things had to be bought for
hlarry and John, now thirteen and ten
years old, and growing, as their mother
used to say, "in genuine western fash
ion." liBut the family were careful in
their outlays, and this summer's crop
would give them at least the satisfac
tion of an unencumbered homestead.
As early in the spring as possible he
I set to work to get the ground in readi
ness and pu; in the seed. i1e had
learned by this time how to do things
on a large scale. lie as well as his
neighbors had an unusual amount of
ground planted in corn; for it had
been too dry in the early spring for oats,
so that the ground intended for that
crop was taken for corn. Day after day
they had gone back and forth. through
the long field until a hundred acres
were planted.
Hardly was the work finished when
a gentle rain tell; and though it lasted
but an hour it furnished the requisite
moisture at the riglht time. In a few
days the long rows could be traced by
a faint line of green which grew darker
and broader almost while one was
loolking upon it. Soon the nice work
of the farmer began to appear. Which
ever way one looked, forward or across
or diagonally, as far as the eye could
see, the lines were as straight as if
run by a surveyor. lIe had done his
part well.
Soon people began to say: "Unless
we have more rain there won't be half
a crop." lBut again there was a slight
shower, and again they were hopeful;
still all longed for a copious downpour.
Things were becoming somewhat
drf. and pasturesas well as crops were
beginning to suffer, when there was
noticed, one morning, a soft south
wind, which Mr. Carter had been ac
customed in Ohio to regard as a sure
indication of rain- The were fairly
jubilant at the prospect. One good
rain would insure the crop. Gradually
and steadily the wind increased both
in velocity and temperature; it was
something new. No rain! And still it
blew stronger and hotter and without
oessation. verytbing was being dr)ed
up; but still it blew strong and ste.ady

- re7 atop whb tb rn s gos raw
but what ean repalt .th. damtage
alreadfy donet P)otle Ud niil WInit t§
.bdi bid lePe was little sleep that
night for the settlers. The wind
still blew relentlessly and without dis
crimination,. Everything in its course,
was doomed.
The next morning revealed a scene of
desolation .ot easily des7Aed. All
night long the birning Wind lTd eriý
tinued its WoAt of destruction. The
leaves of the corn instead of glistening
in the sun were brown, and rattled
against their stalks as if dried in a
kiln. The injury done to the pastures,
though less obvious, was no less com
plete. Hungry cattle were already
circling around the parched field in
searon of fresh feed, and flndaing none.
lvYery hottr fevdaled some new evi
dence of the completeness of the ruin
wrought. Everything in the garden
was totally destroyed. The little trees.
which had been planted the first sum
mer, were brown as in autumn. Set
tiers who had been there long enough
to have small fruit trees begitning to
bear fortad the appie~ halt iiakd oni
the trees. Nowhere could there be
found any sign of vegetable life. In
every direction the outlook was hope
less. Plainly there wan nothing for
man or beast to subsist upon the rest
of the summer or the dotaing winter.
What to do was the one engrossing
question, and for it there was no an
swer. Stock must be disposed of at
once, but whOtd Were the buyers) The
horseis-could it not be that such a
team could be given away? Yet no
one could take them. Must they be
shot to keep them from starving? But
how could the farm ever be worked
without them? Such were the ques
tions that were forced upon the Carter
household at every trsn. lint ite chief
qdcstioui, after all, was what to do
with themselves. They had no friends
in the east, as many had, to whom they
could go for support. If they had,
they hat no money to go with, neither
could they stay where they were with
nothing to live upon.
But that was not all. the capitalist,
to whom they were to have mande a
final payrent this autumn, and then
prove up their land, would have them
in his power. He might foreclose, and
they would not only be left penniless
but would lose their farm and what
money they had already paid. Look
which way they might, there was no
ray of light or hope.
About eleven o'clock John came run
ning in with a scared look. "Mr.
Brown is coming. I can see his buggy
dovwn the lane now."
"Heaven help us!" said the father,
fairly groaning with distress. No one
else said a word. As the dreaded vis
itor neared the house Harry went out
to hitch the horse, and Mr. Brown en
tered.
"Good morning, Dlr. Carter!"
"Morning," was the only response.
"Things look pretty bad to-day,
don't they?"
"Couldn't be worse," replied Mr.
Carter.
"Crops all spiled, I reckon?"
"All gone."
"Nothing surer; and they say it's
that way all over the country," said
Mr. Brown.
"The poorhouse won't hold us all,"
was the only reply.
"You haven't much prospect of pay
ing up that little balance on the note
this fall as I can see."
"Not a cent," said Mr. Carter, as a
vision flashed across his mind of their
little effects set out upon the treeless
prairie, while they
"I kinder thought that was the
shape things were in, and I thought I
might as well come around this morn
ing and tell you-" Here their hearts
fairly stopped beating while waiting
to hear what they knew was to be
their doom.
"It does look pretty tough. We've
never had the 'hot wind' since I came

here before. Well, as I was going to
say, I made up my mind this morning
that none of them that bought their
land of me should be let suffer. You
can just take another year for your
payment, and I guess 1 can keep us
all till spring."
Could it be? Did they hear aright?
F'or a moment Mr. Carter was mo
tionless, then grasping the hand of the
plain old man to thank him, he still,
found himself unable to utter a word
while Mrs. Carter, who could restraisi
her tumultuous feelings no longer,
suddenly threw her apron over her
head and burst into a fit of convulsive
weeping.
Mr. Brown had not counted on any
such scene. He was well-nigh over
come himself, but grasping his hat,
which he had deposited on the floor,
he said to Mr. Carter: "S'pose we go
out and look round a little."--Y. Y. In

An invitation to a garden party re

For an afternoon wedding in the fall
a simple menu would be bouillon or
consomme in cups, cold salmon with
mayonnaise dressing, thin buttered
sandwiches, creamed sweetbreads,
chicken croquettes and salad, cake,
ices, fruits, coffee, punch.
At an afternoon summer wedding
the groom should wear a black frock
coat, light trousers, black cloth or
white duck waistcoat and white tie.
A Tuxedo coat is supposed to be wore
in the evening at home, or in making
informal calls, and in the summer and
otherwise only on occasions when ladIes
are not present. At the theater, unless
ladies are of the party, a Tuxedo coat
is proper.
At the reception at the bride's house
after the wedding, the maid of honor
stands by the bride and helps receive,
even though she is but a young school
girl, not yet out. The bride's parents
also stand in the line. The parents of
the groom, however, do not receive.
They stand in some conspicuous place

strangers they are introduced by the

they will be all loops and no ends.

that is the saddest fault of most rib

for those who desire something with
more dignity than thie tarffetas or gros

black, stamped with a Dresden design
in colors. It has the advantage of
keeping its freshness almost indefinite

Cape Horn was rounded for the first
time in 161e by a Dntcb expedition,

East India company front phseitng by
the cape of Good Hope to the eastward,
or through the straits of Magellan to
the westward, says a writer in McMil
lan's Magazine. The Hoorne was
burned at the entrance to the straits of
Magellan, and some of her timbers
were found of the spot half a century
later by Sir John Narborough. whom
Charles II. sent to Patagonia for gold.
The other vessel pushed on, doubled
and named the Horn after the lost
ship (which had also received its name
from the place of that name In Hol
land, of which one of the principals in
the undertaking was a native). dis
covered and named (after the Amster
dam merchant who conceived the idea),
the straits of Le Maire, and finally
reached the Pacific.
Seventeen years earlier another,
Dutchman,Dirck Gerritz, in a vessel of
only one hundred and fifty tons bur
den, which formed part of the East
India squadron of Simon of Cordes.
had been driven by bad weather
from the western entrance of
the straits of Magellan as far
south as latitude 62 degrees, and dis
covered the islands now known as the
South Shetlands. To him it was
a coast resembling that Rf Norway,
mountainous and covered with snow.
His statement was regarded as apoc
rhpyal until Mr. William Blyth, in the
year 1819. rediscovered the islands
while on a voyage from Montevideo to
Valparaiso.
The Dutch navigator De Gonnevalle
was credited with having, even before
Gerritz, discovered a Terra Australias
to the south of Africa, but we know
fram Pigafetta, the biographer of
Magellan, that the phrase "Ant.actic
pole" was a very loose one, and was
taken to mean the southern hemi
sphere. which is a vastly different mat
ter. Moreover, De Gonneville brought
home to France with him the son of
the sovereign of his new-found land.
which is of itself sufficient to prove
that he did not penetrate far south.
But his story and the signs of his
dusky captive set the hearts of his
countrymen beating with wild hopes
for over a century and a half.-Boston

ATTACKED BY BULLS.
A Traln Assailed by a Hlerd on the Portu
guese Frontler.
A report has been received in Paris
of an extraordinary encounter between
a herd of bulls and a railway train on
the Spanish and Portuguese frontier.
The incident occurred between Moravel
and Canaveral, close to the Portuguese
frontier. The train was traversing a
long plain, similar to hundreds of
others which are used as grazing land
in Spain, when the driver noticed a
number of bulls on the track some dis
tance ahead. He did not slacken speed.
but blew the whistle repeatedly, with
the result that the herd cleared out of
the way, with the exception of one,
which suddenly lowered its head and,
with a fierce bellow, made straight for
the engine. The result was disastrous
for the bull. The animal was com
pletely cut to pieces, and masses
of quivering flesh clung to the
wheel and maoiinery, so much
so that further progress was im
possible, until the engine had been
cleaned. The officials had decided to
do so, when, w:thout a moment's warn
ing, the remainder of the herd. in
furiated probably by the sight of
blood, dashed down upon them. There
was a precipitated rush for the nearest
compartments, and the last man had
scarcely scrambled in when the bulls
attacked the carriages and renewed the
assault again and again, to the con
sternation of the passengers. The
gendarme in charge of the train col
lected, as opportunity offered, a heap
of stones, and energetically pelted the
bulls, besides firing a number of shots.
For two hours the battle raged, and
at last., as night came on, the bulls
seemed to have had enough of it, and
took themselves off, to the immense
relief of the passengers. But this was
not the end of their adventures, for
on arriving at Valencia de Alcantara
the passengers discovered that the
connecting Portuguese train had left,
and they were obliged to put up for
the night as best they could in the
little frontier town. - Westminster

their emancipator, with its prominent
cheekbones and well-defined jaw bone.
