E Fl. BIRE,
I WEEKLY AND DAILY FOR 187:5
The approach of the Presidential el'c
tioi gives nunsual importance to the
events and developnlents of 1875. We
shall endeavor to describe thera fully,
faIithfully, and fearlessly.
THE WEEKLY SUN has now attain
edr a circulation of over seventy thou
sand copies. Its readers ILlr lfound in
0 o\ery State and Territory, and its quali
ty is well known to the p,ublic. We
shall not only endeavor to keep it foilly
liup to the old staunrard, but to imlprove
and add to its variety and power.
THE WEEKLY SUN will continue to
Ie. a thorough newspaper. All the lnews
of the dih y will lie founlld in it, colldeln
ed when unimportant, at full length
when of moment, and always, we trust,
treated ill a clear, interestiug and in
structive manner.
It is oar aim to make the Weekly Sun
the best family ilcwspaper in the -world.
It will be full ot entertaining and ap
lpropriate rending of every sort, but will
r print nothing to offend the most scrupui
lons alndl delicate taste. It will always
contain the most inlterestilig stories and
romances of the day, carefully selected
and legibly printsei.
The Agricultural Department is a
prIminent feature in the Weekly Sun,
and its articles will always be found
fresh land useful to the farmer.
The number of men independent in
Soiitics is increasing, and the Weekly
Sun is their paper especially. It belongs
to no party, and obeys no dictation, con
tending for principle, and for the election
of the best nen. It exposes the corrup
tion that disgraces the country and
threatens the overthrow of republican
institutions. It has no fear of knaves,
and swoks no favors from their support
SThe markts of every kind and the
fashions are regularly reported in its
collunns.
The price of the WEEKLY SUN is one
dollar a year for a sheet of eight pages,
anud fifty-six columns. As this barely
pays expenses of paper and printing, we
are not able to make any discount or al
low any premium to friends who may
make special efforts to extend its circula
tion. IUnder the new law, which re
quires payment of postage in advance,
one dollar a year, with twenty ceuts the
cost of prepaid postate added, is the rate
of subscription. It is not necessary to
get up a club in order to have the Week
ly Sun at this rate.. Any one who sends
one dollar and twenty cents will get the
paper, post-paid, for a year.
We have no traveling agents.
THE WEEKLY SIN.-Eight pages,
fifty-six columns. Only $1.'20 a year,
plostage prepaid. No discount from this
rule;
THE DAILY SUN.--A large four-page
newspaper of twenty-eight ciolumns
Daily circulation over 120 000. All the
news for 2 cents. Subscription, postage
prepaid 55 cents a month, or $650 a year.
To clubs of 10 or over a discount of '20
per cent. Address.

THE
People's Vindicator,
FOR 1875.;
We take pleasure in announcing to the
numerous friends of the VINDICTOR,
that we have perfected arrangements for
the continuation of its publication upon
a firm basis. The public are well aware
of the difficulties under which the Con
servative press of Louisiana labor; the
infamous printing law nassed by a parti
san Legislature, solely to foster and up- I
hold, at the expense of the tax-payers,
journals entirely antagonistical to their
interest, and at war upon their liblrties,
and by forcing, under the forms of law,
our citizens to advertise in these otficial
pIapers, to break down their power, the
Conservative and Democratic press; con
sequently we are compelled to depend
for support upon the generous contribu
tion rf a people already poverty-stricken, I
but we feel assured that they a 11 not
fail to sustain their main power in the
war of virtue against vice
The Fearless Whitle Ian's Press of
Louisiana,
The future tone of thid paper can be
judged from its past. We will continue a
to advocate to success, the rights of the
TAXED, that honesty and capability,
ALONE, shall constitute grounds for po- i
litical preferment, and a eontinned and
never ceasing war upon Kellogg and his
ceorrupt officiale--knowing them to be in
common with their Chief, both usurpers
and thieves.
We can assure the public that we will
not hesitate to attack the acts of any po
litical organization, when we believe
them to be antagonistic to public good.
We are the servant of no elique or party,
and intend solely to protect and defend
thle rights anid liberties, in our honest
way, of the whole people-believing that
we have done snuicent service in the
cause of the PEOPLE in the paest, we
confidently expect their eupport in the
future.

THE ALUM :
THE ART JOURNAL OF AMERICA,
ISUE)D MIONTHLY.
"A Magniflcent Conception, wonderfilly
carried out."
The necessity of a popular mendiin for
Sthe re'pressetntion (of the lprodnettions of
our great artists, has alwhays 1beenI recCo.
)lized, and many attempts have leeol
made to nlmeet the want. The saccessi4ve
failures which so invaribly tollowoed eu':h
attempt in this country to establlish a:t
art journal, did not prove t-he indiffier
ence of the people of America to the
claims of high art. So soon as a proper
appreciation of the want and an ability
to meet it were shown, the public at
once rallied with enthusiasm to its sup
port. and the result was a gIreat artistic
and commercial triutmphi-THE ALDINE.
TIHE ALDINE, while issued with anil the
regularity. has none of the temporary or
timely interest characteristic of ordin.ary
peori,'dicals. It is an elegant miscellany
of pure, light and graceful literature; and
a collection of pictures, the rarest sleci
mens of artistic skill, in black and white.
Although each succeeding numlber affords
a fresh pleasure to its friends, the real
value and beanuty of the ALnrxa will lie
most appreciated after it has been bIund
up at the close of the year. While other
journals may claim superior cheapness, as
compared with ri rals of a similar class,
the ALDINE is it unique and original con
ception-alone and unapproached-abso
lutely withbot competition in price or
character. The possessor of a complete
volume cannot duplicate the qnant!ty of
fine paper and engravings in any other
shape or number of volumes for ten times
its cost; and then, there is the Chronlo
besides !
National featureTof TIlE ALDINE
must be taken in no narrow sense. True
art is cosmopolllitan. While TIlE AL
DINE is a strictly American institution,
it does not conline itself entirely to the
reproduction of native art. Its mission
is to cultivate a broad and appreciative
art taste, one that will discrinunate only
on grounds of intrinsic merit. Thus,
while placing before the patrons of THE
ALDINE, as a leading characteritic, the
productions of the most noted American
artists, attention will always be given to
specimens from foreign masters, giving
subscribers all the pleasure and instruc
tion obtainable from home or foreign
sources.
The artistic illustration of American
scenery, original with THE ALDINE, is
an important feature, and its magnificent
plates are of a size more appropriate to
the satisfactory treatment of details
than can be afforded by any inferior
page. The judicious interspersion of
landscape, marine, figure, and animal
subjects, sustain an unabated interest,
impossible where the scope of the work
confines the artist too closely to a single
style of subject. The literature of THE
ALDINE is a light and graceful accom
paniment, worthy of the artistic fea
tures, with only such technical disqrisi
tiogs as do not interfere with the popu
lar interest of the work.
Premiunm for 1875.
Every subscriber for 1875 will receive
a beautiful portrait, in oil colors, of the
same noble dog whose picture 4n a for
mer issuaattracted so much attention,
"MAN'S UTSELFISH FRIEND"

rybody loves such a dog, and the portrait
is executed so true to the life, that it
seems the veritable presence of the ani
mal itself. The Rev. T. De. Witt Tal
mage tells that his own Newfoundland
dog (the finest in Brooklyn, barks at it!
though so natural, no one who sees
this premium chrombo will have the
slightest fear of being bitten.
