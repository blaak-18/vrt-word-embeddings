its manufactures and sells them in Lon
don cheaper than in Chicago, this proves
that the Chicago price is extortionate.
When the Trust goes to South America
and sells plantation implements cheaper
than it sells them in Alabama and lowa,
this proves that the home price is a
robbery of the home people.
And think of the colossal magnitude
of this spoliation under forms of law!
The revenues of this one Trust are
greater than those of any South Ameri
can state.
THEY ARE TWICE AS LARGE AS
THOSE OF THE REPUBLIC OF
MEXICO.
They are three times as large as the
revenues of Egypt. They are nearly twice
as large as the revenues of the dual King
dom of Austro-Hungary.
They are larger than the annual reve
nues of China, and greater than the year
ly income of the militant empire of Japan !
Yet the Steel Trust is but one of our
cormorant trusts! The damnable Tariff
has created them in all directions. They
are to be numbered by the hundred.
Is it any wonder that the howl of the
human wolf is heard in the slums of
our cities?
Is it any marvel that sullen rage is tak
ing possession of the souls of the peo
ple ?
The man who cannot see storm-clouds
on the horizon is blind. He who can
not hear the low growl of distant thun
der is deaf.
No; the Steel Trust is not going to
reduce any prices,—save those in the mar
kets of competition, abroad. In this
American market, where Privilege gives
it a monopoly, it is going to squeeze the
people to the very utmost, —relaxing none
of its grip on its victims.
THAT’S THE WAY THE FRENCH
ARISTOCRATS BROUGHT ON THE
FRENCH REVOLUTION.
Whitelaw Reid, our useless and ex
pensive Ambassador to Great Britain,
made quite a notable speech, a few days
ago. He said that our present institu
tions—social, religious, commercial, po
litical. etc. —were giving way in all direc
tions, and that a new Order was at hand.
This proves that Whitelaw is paying
attention.
Old institutions are giving away. It
is just such enormities of crime as that
which the law has sanctioned in the case
of the Steel Trust that is making the pres
ent system of things totter to its fall.
Not a word does the President say
against this robber combine of Capital.
Not a word does Congress say.
Why?
Because the criminal millionaires who
own the Trust OWN A CONTROL
LING INTEREST IN BOTH THE
OLD PARTIES.
THE JEFFERSONIAN.
Need the Negroes to Beat the Pops.
We have long been aware of the fact
that certain Democratic politicians were
secretly opposed to the disfranchisement
of the negroes. We know that these cor
rupt agents o*f Wall Street feared that
as soon as the Dugaboo of Negro Domi
nation was removed, the Southern States
would throw the yoke of Eastern domi
nation, and would become truly demo
cratic as they were before the Civil War.
The affidavits which we produce, be
low, prove that politicians of the cor
poration stripe are already passing the
word down the line.
Notice that this Livingston talk was a
mid-night talk, and that he first made
sure that no newspaper men, or Mayson
men, were present before he gave the
“tip.”
Three of his hearers were men who
believed that the people of Georgia ought
to know what sly game is afoot, and
hence their affidavits:
I, J. H. Lassiter, a citizen of Camp
bell County, hereby state the following
facts: I was in Fairburn, Georgia, on the
night of April 3, and heard Col. L. F.
Livingston make the following statement
in a speech : “I suppose there are none of
Mr. Mayson’s followers in the room?” He
also asked the question, “Are there any
newspaper reporters present? I do not
want what I say to get to the papers.”
The crowd answered “No!” “Then I ad
vise you all not to vote to disfranchise the
negro, for we will need him inside of
eight years to beat Tom Watson and his
crowd, which the negro calls poor white
trash.”

I, W. W. Cook, was in the rear of a
store in Fairburn. Georgia, on the night
after the congressional race about twelve
o’clock. Mr. Livingston made a speech,
supposed to be to his followers only, in
which he said: “Are there any report
ers in the room, as I do not want what
I say to get in the papers.” The an
swer came, “No.” “I desire to say to
you all not to vote for the disfranchise
ment of the negro, for we will need him
on our side in eight years to beat Tom
Watson and his class, which the negro
calls the poor white trash.”
(Signed.) W. W. Cook.

I, E. W. Dodson, of the County of
Campbell, was present in the rear of a
store in the presence of several others,
about twelve o’clock at night on April 3,
1908. Mr. Livingston made a speech
in which he said: “Are there any report
ers in the room, as I do not want what
I say to get in the papers. I advise you
all not to vote for the disfranchisement
of the negro, for we will need him inside
of eight years. Mr. Watson cannot get
the negro vote, for the negro calls him
and his class the poor white trash.”

Governor Vardaman's Warning.
In his admirable weekly paper, The Is
sue, ex-Governor Vardaman of Missis
sippi sounds a note of friendly warning
to the leaders of the Farmers’ Union.
He urges them not to organize the
negroes.
In this, The Jeffersonian agrees with
our neighbor, The Issue. More than a
year ago, we earnestly remonstrated with
those who were advocating the organi
zation of the negroes into another secret
society.
If there is anv one thing of which
this country has the greatest plenty, it is
negro secret societies.
We cannot conceive of anything calcu
lated to be more dangerous and uncon
trollable than the organization of the
country negroes into industrial secret so
cieties.
Beware what you do, friends!
