ONLY IN DREAMS I SEE THEE.
By Mary Chapin Smith.
In dreams I may possess thee,
In dreams my heart is thine;
In dreams thy soul comes near me
And answers back to mine.
Only in dreams I see thee,
Thou art not of the earth;
These arms shall never clasp thee,
No' land has given thee birth.
Thoi art a shape of hopes and loves,
A vision of the air,
A frame of high imaginings,
Os tenderness and care.
<
No form compact of mortal flesh,
No locks with golden gleams,
Gan ever hold my heart away
Grom this dear maid of dreams.
Professor Peck, champion hurler of
tirades against the gentler sex, has
just been divorced by his wife on
ground of desertion, failure to pro
vide or care about a home, and other
complaints. ’Twas generally, if not
ever, thus. The man who spends
most of his energy pointing out
to women their duty, crying, “Back
to domesticity for you,” and the old,
familiar iteration of twaddle, is often
the most remiss of husbands himself
and fails utterly to give his own wife
any chance at home life.
The professors of the Peck and Her
rick type are sillier than the silliest
types they try to portray of the op
posite sex.
Time was when certain women agi
tators, burning with a very natural
indignation at legal and social injus
tices from which they and their sis
ters suffered, went to the unnatural
extreme of treating all mankind as
enemies of all womankind.
That era of argument has about
passed, fortunately, but a different
sort of sex antagonism seems about
to be precipitated by epigram-greedy
male creatures who profess to fear
that the feminine element is inade
quate either to its own “sphere” or
any other.
TO SISTER POPULISTS.
Editress of Jeffersonian :
I, too, am glad we have a depart
ment. I never wrote for publication
before. The old party papers were
never attractive to me. Poultry,
cows, cooking, and scrubbing was al
ways connected in my mind as the
mate to the “The Man with the Hoe.”
We have that on our minds too
much now; the insane institutions are
drawing the largest per cent from the
women of rural life.
We should have diversity of
thought; in fact, higher ideals, and
make our life more elevating. The
Bible teaches, “Render unto God the
things that are God’s and unto
Caesar the things that are Caesar’s.”
That is, first, love God, second, love
(Country.
The old party women say politics
are not for women. How can we love
(country when we know nothing about

it? Just as much sense in loving
God and never reading the Bible, lis
tening to the gospel being preached
and discussing religious points.
We are allowed freedom of thought.
I don’t believe in the ballot for wom
en ; while there are women, strong
mentallv and physically, that do; but
the delicate, nervous crowd are in
the majority. The women of the
Revolutionary war and the women of
the Confederacy were “the power be
hind the throne.” They didn’t shoul
der the gun, but they cheered the
men on to the front.
The adage, “The hand that rocks
the cradle rules the world,” used to
be true, but not now.
Let’s build it up again. While the
men of the family are toiling, let the
women devote their leisure time to
studying these economic questions.
Then the family chats will be so
pleasant. Let me illustrate woman’s
power: The latter part of the 60’s
a coinfle of relatives visited a cele
brated convent to enter their two
girls. The man was so delighted with
the system that he said, “Mother,
whv don’t you have such schools for
boys?” She answered impulsively,
“Oh - "nan rules the world!” Then
she tr‘ ' 1 to retract.
Here is the fruit of it. A relative
was recently at one of Mr. Watson’s
rallies, and in onversation with a
he spo 1 " > of how zealous a Pop
ulist and admirer of Mr. Watson he
had been; he talked on find out
why he had deserted; r-’ ‘ secret
was his wife was a r r s it
hadn’t been for his wif . d : ug !, -
never would have known. < i cared,
whether Mr. Watson was Protestant,
Catholic, or Mohammedan.
While the Protestant class is rant
ing for the ballot, new thought, so
ciety fads and the heathen nations,
the Catholic class are quietly folding
t their bosoms the descendants of
the persecuted Christians that settled
America.
Sisters of the Populist household,
three cheers! And let us take up the
work. My great grandsire who raised
my mother was a Revolutionary sol
dier; my father, a rebel colonel. So
I’ll sign,
The Daughter of Two Wars.
HELPING THE PEOPLE’S CAUSE.

Editor Jeffersonian:
Since the Jeffersonian began a
weekly I had so often wondered why
the lady admirers of Mr. Watson
were not allowed to express their
gratitude for the noble work he has
been engaged in since the early days
of his political career, when he so
gallantly fought in congress alone,
rather than be found in bad com
pany. I have always admired his in
dependence and, knowing a great deal
of his life, am exceedingly glad to
speak a few words in behalf of so no
. ble and generous a statesman. It is
safe to say that those who parade as
his persecutors are only jealous of
his achievements, and right here I
would shy thaJ in following his Lord
and Master, the lowly Nazarene, in
Jeffersonian
doing his duty to liberate the bur
dened masses, he became the target
of political domination, persecuted
beyond endurance. He hid himself
in his study long enough to come
forth again to fame that no man,
however great, can banish. The name
of T. E. Watson will live in history
long after the gray sod has covered
his form and his feeble body has
crumbled into dust. Being an eye
witness to some swindling carried on
against him in the Black-Watson cam
paign, I shed tears at the sight and
often in my closet fell upon my knees
and prayed that he would be lifted
above all this and become the world’s
greatest reformer.
Reared in a Georgia home, the child
promise has not failed to seize every
opportunity to become great. How
ever successful he may be, he never
forgets his friends. Should he be our
President, we shall always claim him
as our self-made Georgia Tom.
Now that we have a page, we Pop
ulist ladies should write enough to
keep the page, and let’s try to im
prove it each time. I am doing what
I can to help the people’s cause and
will join in every way I think profit
able.
I a farmer myself, and sympa
thize with them in their struggle and
realize that their success will come
onlv through a reform movement. I
enjoy both of the Jeffersonians and
am not satisfied till I have read every
v ’ r "” • - eac h issue, even the adver
tisements.
’■ best wishes to our dear edi-

RECIPES.
P”"Carrots Parboil three
cups of carrots, cut in cubes, ten min

gar, one cup of chopped raisins, one
egg, one cup sour milk, one-half even
teaspoon cloves, one-half even tea
spoon cinnamon, two tablespoons of
stewed cranberries, pinch of salt.
This makes two pies.
Lemon Raisin Pie—Grate rind and
juice of one lemon, one egg, one cup
sugar, one cup raisins, one tablespoon
flour sifted with sugar. Put raisins
in one cup water, boil five minutes.
Add to mixture and cpol before put
ting into oven to bake. Bake with

and add to it half of its weight in
sugar; then stir in the whipped white
of one egg. Roll the mixture into
balls or cones and bake in moderate
oven for about twenty minutes. If
the mixture is too soft to hold its
shape a very little flour may be ad
ded.
Raisin S >onge Cake —Three eggs,
not separated, one and one-half sups

rounding teaspoon of baking powder
in one and one-half cups flour, one
cup cut up and floured raisins. Bake

A PRETTY HAIR ORNAMENT.
The prettiest kind of hair orna
ment may be made by the clever wo
man by taking a yard and a half of
inch-wide velvet ribbon and a yard
of milliner’s wire.
The bows are wire 1 only at the one
side of the ribbon and are tied into
four crinkly loops and two upstand
ing pointed ends, which are embroid
ered on the top with gold or silver
paillettes, the tiniest to be found.
A hairpin is run through the knot
at the bnpk to stick it in the hair
easily. Sometimes it is worn just at
the ‘ of the large puff and again
it is tucked at one side close to the
left ear. —Herald.
Proportions for Salad Dressing.
The ideal salad dressing is acknowl
edged to be of lemon juice and the
finest olive oil. Lemon juice is far
preferable to vinegar, on acmrnnt of
the latter’s being so bad for
the stomach. Whether the dressing
b a • '"’onnaise, French dressing or
any her kind the proper proportion
s one part lemon juice to three
parts oil. Those who care less for
oil often use it half and half. —Birm-
ingham Age-Herald.
Church work in Uganda has been
greatly aided of late years *by the
Prime Minister, Apolo Kagwa, at
whose home every week there is a
Bible class which is often attended
by as many as thirty of the highest
chiefs.
