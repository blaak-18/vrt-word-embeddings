DILC.IoLANE'S
Celebrated American
WORM SPECIFIC
OR
VERMIFUGE.
SYMPTOMS OF WORMS.
THE countenance is pale and lead
en-colored, with occasional flushes,
or a circumscribed spot on one or both
cheeks; .the eyes be m e dull; the
pupils dilate- an atllre semicircle
runs along the lower eye-lid; the
nose is irritated, swells, and sometimes
bleeds; a swelling of the upper lip;
occasional headache, with humming
or throbbing of the ears; an unusual
secretion of saliva; slimy or furred
tongue; breath very foul, particularly
in the morning; appetite variable,
sometimes voracious, with a gnawing
sensation of the stomach, at others,
entirely gone; fleeting pains in the
stomach; occasional nausea and vom
iting; violent pains throughout the
abdomen; bowels irregular, at times
costive; stools slimy, not unfrequent
ly tinged with blood; belly swollen
and hard; urine turbid; respiration
occasionally difficult, and accompa.
nied by hiccough; cough sometimes
dry and convulsive; uneasy and dis
turbed sleep, with grinding of the
teeth; temper variable, but generally
irritable, &c.
Whenever the above symptoms
are found to exist,
DR. C. McLANE'S VERMIFUGE
will certainly effect a cure.
IT DOES NOT CONTAIN MERCURY
in any form; it is an innocent prepa
ration, not rapable of doing th slghtest

Iespectftlly Tendered to an Amiable
Friend-. J. . *
BY W. C. J.
E'en now-as when in life's youngdream,
I woo the muse, with fond desire,
That some sweet strain of song may
stream,
Athwart the withered, time worn lyre.
But uh !---the numbers cease to flow,
I, songwaves o'er the failing strings,
And tremulous the tone-and low,
And weak the oflfring, that it brings.
Then ask me not, Fair one again,
To bring lilbations from the "Nine,'
I sweep the ebords of song in vaie,
Upon this broken harp of mine.
In years, when U1isad Love were young,
And Hopes, like fowers, were bright ad
gay
When all the chords ofson were strung,
And Life was in it' lovely May.
When cloudles was it's morning sky,
(;entle and clear it's flowing stream,
When Hours, on Fairy wing, swept by,
And Fancy wove her wild wield dream.
I gather'd oft, the beauteous flowers,
That cluster'd 'round the muses' spring,
Uncocieous, that those joyous Hours,
So swiftly sped on Fairy wing.
-Now all those charms of life are gone,
The linne a font has ceased to flow,
The ilush of flower, and thrill of song,
Are dear alone, to memory now.
Those hours are mingled now with years,
They, with their joyst are in the-pat,
Mere legends now, of smilei and tears,
And tA. is all of life at last.
LoI thine a life, withdat t's tear,
A hme O Joe 'sad puce-tbhy breut,
Thy span oft beilen-legth of yss,'
Life's close-a eall to edlsm rest.
ay that werm, generos bheart of thine,
Nor feel a pang,-nor heave a sigh,
It should not for 'tie virtnee' hriqe,
Pure as the snowflake from the sky.
And when life's elosing moments come,
And deathmiast o'er thy seses lower,
Be it-a messge-'Welce bhome,'
And death, uast, thy sweetest boar.
