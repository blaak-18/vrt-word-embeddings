POETRY.
TO THE IVEY.
Lone tenant of tho wasted spot
Where softened désolai ion smiles;.
Where weeds grow rank-o'or graVcs forgot
And ruin sighs through grass-grown-ailo*!
Still clinging round some withered trunk,
Or mouldering-tenement of age;'
Or where the riven wall has sunk .
Benciith destruction's leagiiçiing rage.
Child of decay! no blushing flower,
No cup of treasured sweets is thine,
To breathe*in beauty's fragrant, bejver,
Or ofiarm wlibre statelier rivals-shine;
The column of the desert, place,
The warrior's cross,,the nameless stonq.
Reçoive thy clasping boughs' eihbract!,
And thow thy clustiying wreaths alone!
The violet and the queen-like rose,
Frail minions of a passing day,
Brief as the faith which falsehood shows!—
But bloom while lasts-their worshiped
ray;
To me thy mournful leaf excels
The fairest buds whose petals fling
Their «»dors where the summer dwells
Or gem the verdant robes of spring.
Yet type of truth ! when fortune wanes;
Anil grief, that haunts the mouldering
tomb;
And love, that, strong as death, sustains
Tho whirlwind's shock and tempt-st
gloom;
Thon still, amidst the howling bl.fst,
When all is drear, art smiling on;
Unchanged, unshrinking to the last,
And green when even hope°is gone!

The Southern Iiifci'Bio.
From the leading editorial in the
New York Herald of the 21st, on
"The Troubles in the Sontli," we ox
tract the following sensible and truth
ful observations : « a »
It is easyofo provoke chaos and
call it reconstruction. This is what
we have "done in the South. Its con
dition to-day is far worse politically
than Poland or Ireland. In Poland
tho Military hand presses rudely
upon the peojjje, but they art; not
robbed. In Ireland aliens sit in
authority, but, they aie gentlemen
who do. not show their dislike to
'%ome ride and repeal I»y robbing the
exchequer. It has bee?, reserved for
the American Republic to unite
Russian severity with a capacity
which belongs to no other nation
and for which we have to find ©i
parallel in the careers oP Yerres and
Warren Hastings. 0
The "blame for this rests largely
upon the General Government, b'^j
not wholly. We do not excuse the
leaders of the South for their apathy.
Something more than silent, rmpro
testing acquiesancc in the rule of
adventurers and ignorant freedmen
was required from the men who had
been high in 0 the council of the
Confederacy and who still pos- essed
,popular confidence. The Southern
peopm have been abandoned and
helpless. The men who should have
guided them threw away responsi
bility. There is not a Southern
Staate, excepting, perhaps, South
Carolina, where, notwithstanding the
Suffrage to the negroes <J>ml disfran
chisement, the old leaders ot the
South would not have succeeded in
overturning the rule of the carpet
baggers, or at least frustrating their
schemes until an awakened public
spirit iu the North camc to their
aid.
What will be the ©end? Some
think that we simH have these
periodical and constantly recurring
{Outbreaks, these eruptions of the
political volcano, until it burns oat
and becomes extinct. We are re
minded tliablong after the Stuarts
were driven from tho throne of
England, their followers were mu
cinous and defiant ; that rebellion
succeeded rebellion for more than
a half century, until Jacobitism be
came a memory and was only pre
served in ballads and romances. But
England never oppressed the Jacob
ites, wl$ie Ireland, which tilie did
oppress, remains as hostile to hei
mle as she was seven centurie^ ago.
The condition of the Souther'® States
is a scandal, ç ct>
We can never feel that we "hare
perfect peace» until we have perfect
reconstruction. Dante, in his im
mortal poem, speiRis of visiting tuat
Jicll where the surface of the black
water was ever bubbling. It was be
cause of the sighs of suffering souls
imprisoned beneath the waters. We
never see these babblings and rest
less movements of Southern society
without feeling that they represent
the imprisoned souls beneath, and
hoping that tluPtiine may come when
they ©will be released from their
thraldom and admitted to the re-,
spqusibility of a generous and un
tainted citizenship.

A VIVID SKETCH OF TIIE CITY PROM
VICTOR HUGO'S- LAST NOVEL:
Very *few of tin? largest shops
were open. Peripatetic haberdash
ery and top-shops were' dragged
about Jfry woman, ' lighted by can
dles, whioli.dropped tlieii -tallôw on
the merchandise. Open air shops
were kept by ex-nuns in blonde
wigs. The mender, darning stock
ings in n stall, was a countess ; that
dress-maker a marchioness. -Ma
dame de Bon filers inhabited a gar
ret, from which she could, look out
at her own hotel, llawkers ran
about offer in the "papers of news."
Persons who wore cravats that hid
their chins were called "the scrofu -
lous." Street singers swanned.
Tj,ic crowd hooted Pitou, the royal
ist song writer, and a valiant, man
in the bargain., : iHiey danced the
carmagnole in great circles. They
no longer said gentleman and lady,
but citizen aiul citizeness. '£hey
danced in the ruined cloisters with«
r he church lamps lighted on the al
tars, wj^h cross-shaped chandeliers
hanging from the vaulted roofs and
tombs beneath their feet. Blue
"•blue tyrant's waist-coats" were
worn. There were liberty-cap shirt
pins©made of white, blue and red
stones. The Rue de Richelieu was
called the street ?>f law® the Fau
bourg of Glory ; a statue of Nature
stood in the Place de la Bastile. At
the invalides the statues of the
saints and kings were crowned with
Phrygian caps. They played cards
on the curbstones at the crossings.
The packs of cards were also in-the
full tide of revolution; the kings
were replaced by genii,-the queens
by the goddess of liberty, the knaves
by figures representing equity, and
tiie aces by impersonations of law.
They tilled the public @ gardens,
the plow worked at the Tuileries.
Wifcit all these excesses was min
gled, especially among tiie conquer
ed parties, an indescribable haughty
weariness of lifo Aman wrote to
E(guqier Einville. ''Have the good
ness to free me from existence.
This is my address." Newspaper«
appeared iu legions The hair
dresse's men curled the wigs of wo
men in public, while the master
read the Moniteur aloud. People
went to Injvo their fortunes told by
Martin, at No. ®173^in tke^llufc
d'Anjou. There was alackofbread,
of coals, of soap. Flocks of milch
cows might be seen coming in from
the country. At the Vallee* lamb
sold at fifteen -francs per pound.
An order of the Commune assigned
a pound of meat per head every
ten days. People stood in rank at
the doors of the butcher's shops.
One of these files had remained fa
nions; it reached from a groetfr's
shop in the Rue des Petit Can (Au
to the middle of the Rue Mon
torgueli. r &> form a^ line \%s
called " holding the cord," lit : is
a long rope which was held
in the bauds of those standing
in the row. Amid this wretched-^
ness, the women brave and m rid.
They passed entire nights awaiting
their turn to get into the bakers'
shops. Wood cost @*00 francs in
coin per cdrd; people could be seen
in the streets sowing up their bed
steads. In the winter the -foun
tains were frozen; two pails of wa
ter cost twenty sous; every®nian
made himself a wa&r carrier. A
golden louis was worth 3,990 (pa
per)'fraucs. ®A course in a hackney
coach cost 000 francs. After a day's
use of a carriage, this sort of dial
logue might be heard: "Coachman,®
how|mticli do I o'^e you ?" "Six
thousand bancs." A green grocer
woman s<M -0,000 francs' worth of
vegetables a day. A beggar said:
"Help me in the name of charity
It took 230 francs to finish paying
for my shoes " .There was no flat
tering among this people. There
was the sombre joy of lining made
an end ot thrones. ©Volunteers
abounded; each street furnished a
battalion. » 0
A lady of Washington eonfi
ty, New Y r ork, is a mother of a large
family of children, and they are all
ratlyr diminutive. A few days af
ter the birth of the youngest, a lit
tle niece of the lady called to see
the baby. After looking at the tiny

tle girl o said : "Aunt Maria, don't
you think it would be better to have
less of 'em aud have 'em bigger."
IfotV to Put on a Corset.
[From the San Francisgp Chronicle.}
At/ ? this juncture tiie Coronet de
sired-to show to the jury the course
taken by the ball, and for this pur
pose produced the corset Worn by
Mrs,. Burkhart at the time of the
tragedy. " Yon see," said he—and
hei« he drew thex-orset around Iiis
waist with"fhe laces in. front—^'the
ball must have'gone in.here from
behind. No, that can't be, either,
foi- the doctor says the ball went
in iu Iront. -Confound it, I've got
it on wrong. Ah ! this way."
"(Here the Coroner put on 'the Dor
set on upside do wji .) "Now, you
see," pointing to the hole, in the
garment, which rested directly over
his hip, "the ball must have gone
in hero. No, that can't be, either,
for—" °
Here Mr. Mathog, the handsomest
man on the jury, broke in. "Dr.
Stillman," said he, "you've got
that corset on wrong." Here Dr.
Stillinan blushed lik8 a* peony.
" Well," said he, " I've been mar
ried twice, aud I ought to -kno\^
how to rig a corset." " Yes," saht
Mr. Mather» " but you don't. You
had it right in the first place. The
strings go in front, and the ladies
clasp them together in the back.
Don't I know ^ I think 1 ought
to; I've been married. If* you
doubt it, look here (pointing to the
fullness in the top).©' Ho\? do you,
suppose that's going to be filled up
unless you put it on as I suggest V'
"That," said Dr. Stillinan, why,
that goes over the hips." "No; it
don't," said Mr/Mather; "that
fullness goes somewhere 'else—
this way ;" and here Mr. M.ither
indicated where @ he thought the
fjgljness ought to go.
At this a pale-faced young man,
wijii a voice like a robin, and a
note book under his arm,@said he
thought the ladies always clasped
their corsets on the side. The pale
faced young man said this very in
nocently, as if he wished to convey
the inibjression thatlie knew noth
ing whltevcr of the matter. The
jury laughed the pale-laced young
man to scorn and one of them in
timating that he thought the young
man was not halt so.green âijout
women's dress as he tried to ap
pear. The young man was a re-,
porter, and it js therefore exceed
ingly .propîtble tli^'.t his knowledge
was "fully as limited, as was appar
ent from his suggestion, the jury
man to the contrary notwithstand
ing. ®
©Here another juryman discover
ed that Dr. Stillinan had the eor
"set on bottom side up. "Doctor,"
said he, " put it On the other way."
T^en the Doctor put it on in re
verse order, with the laces in-front.
This brought the bullet holes di
rectly over the.tails of his coat.
'î I don't think "{said Mr. Mather,
"that-the bullet wen-t in there,
Doctor." ®
" No, I dtyi't think it did," was
the reply. "Confound it,- it's
mighty funny—six married ineii in
this room, and not ongthat knows
how@to pu^on a woman's corset.''
Here the Chronicle r<jpor ter, who
had ^several sisters, and always
keeps iMs eyes open, advanced and
convinced Dr." Stillinan and Mr.
Mather, after much argument, that
s>the laces of a corset :fb behind, and
that the garnie t is clasped in

course of the bube.t. was readily
traced, and found to bear put the
explanation afforded l>y the two

t^Clie following 'igood 'thing"
we clip fi'oi^ an exchange: A coun
ty clerk in a rural town had a pet
calf, which he was training up iu
w;fy of an ox. The calf walked
around veiy peaceably under one
end of the e yoke, while Mr.'Clark

held up the othersend. B^it
iuifortuiia®jö moment the man con
ceived the idea of putting, iiis own
neck in the yoke, to let the calf see
how it would seem to work with a
partner; this frightened the calf,
and elevating his tail and his voice,
he struck a "dead run" for the vil
lage, aud Mr. Clark went, along
with his head down and his plug
hat iu e his haul!, straining every
nerve to keep up, and crying out at
the to^> of his voice: "Here we

He further sued for the emoluments of the

the same. About the same time Attorney
General Yonley tiled in the Supreme

That decision, in etlect, dispôsed of the
case instituted by e Brooks in the Circuit
Court, and nothing more was- thaught of
the matter. The case has remained on th v -
Circuit Court docke, t to.the present time
Judges English and Comptou, the at/tor
neys of Gov.- Baxter, endeavored, several
times to get th^ casé dismissed; but for
some cause or other they could never suc

List week. (Saturday, wo believe,)
Judge English again broached the nffiuter
to Brook's counsel or suiimnntting the de

from Judge English himself— that the de
inurrex slion® not be submitted until next
weelfe Ou Monday, when both of Gov

we are iiiforiHcd, on ^he part of Mr.
Whipple was nof thought of even" then ;
no .one dreaming that iudgt) Whytock
would rule otherwise than as the Supreme
Court had decided—that be had no juris
diction of the case. g ®
About 11 o^clock yesterday morning, how
ever, while Judge English and Comptou
were absent, Judge Whytock delivered a
decision in the case, overruling the -de
murrer- submitted by Whipple, without
the knowledge or consent of Gov. Baxter's
counsel—aud ordering u judgment of
