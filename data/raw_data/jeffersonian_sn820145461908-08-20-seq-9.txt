against something and laugh.
heeny begged hard to have the issue
referred to a jury—the Executive Council
of the American Federation of Labor—
but Brother Gompers refused.
Just as Bryan doesn’t object to politi
cal theft- when he gets the benefit of it,
so Brother Gompers sees no danger in
the one-man power when Gompers hap
pens to be the one man.

"Bryan and Brotonsyille.
The Atlanta Constitution tries to help
Bryan out, on the Brownsville matter, by
publishing something the Peerless One
wrote for the Commoner in 1906.
Good gracious, Clark, is that the best
that can be done?
1906 was away back yonder. The
“Gladstone of America” had not then been
Taggartized and Kerned. He had not
tn realized that the negro leaders were
goik., to make a campaign issue out of
Brownsville. Bishop Walters and other
g/colored delegates did not foresee that they
'would be welcome visitors to the Bryan
home, and that the negro vote would be
offered to the ‘‘Cicero of America” upon
certain conditions.
Did not Bryan admit that what the
negroes published about the Fairview
trip was true in one respect, at least, to
wit: that he would approve the Foraker
bill if Congress passed it?
He certainly did admit it. Then what ?
Roosevelt had said that he would veto
the Foraker bill. Why? Because the
criminals who shot up Brownsville could
re-enlist in the army under the terms of
that bill.
Every soldier in the troop that was
dishonorably discharged has sworn that
he was innocent. Yet the President, the
Secretary of War. the Court Martial and
the U. S. Senate have declared that the
evidence proves some of those discharged
men to be
Under the Foraker bill those black
criminals, REEKING WITH THE
BLOOD OF THE WHITE VICTIMS
OF THE BROWNSVILLE RIOT, can
perjure themselves one more time and
get back into the army.
Knowing that this is the purpose of
the Toraker bill, Mr. Roosevelt says that
if Congress should pass it, he will veto it.
Knowing that this is the purpose of
the Foraker bill, Mr. Bryan says that ix
Congress should pass it he will approve it.
Bryan admits that he promised the ne
gro delegation that much.
This being so, how does that editorial
of December, 1906, carry any comfort to
those who believe that Roosevelt, Taft,
the Court Martial, and the Senate have
done right in condemning those riotous
brutes?
BRYAN HIMSELF DID NOT
DREAM, IN 1906, THAT HE WOULD
FIND IT TO HIS POLITICAL IN-
THE JEFERSONIAN.
TEREST, IN 1908, TO LINE UP
WITH FORAKER AND THE NEGRO
MURDERERS.

Extra Session.
Can we believe what we see
in the papers— that Gov. Smith has called
an extra session of the Legislature?
But the state can’t afford it. We know
this to be so, because Hoke’s own organ,
the Journal, said it. Besides, it is “fool
ish” to call an extra session. We know
it is, because Hoke's organ said so.
Has the state discovered any buried
treasure since 1907? Is she richer? Have
tax returns and tax collections overflowed
the treasury ? Has not the Legislature
been doing its level best to vote every
blessed dollar out of the vaults?
An extra session!
Who’d ’a’ thought it?
So it is not “foolish,” after all, to call
extra sessions to complete unfinished
business, and the state can afford it.
That’s good.
„If Hoke had gone right on, in 1907, de
nouncing the recreant legislators and put
ting upon them the pressure of aroused
public opinion— instead of making a set
speech at Mcßae in which he said he had
no adverse criticism to place upon the
legislature —there would not now be so
much of this unfinished work cumbering
the shop.

Hearst Tabors Lolv-Priced Cotton.
The cotton growers should read the
leading editorial in Mr. Hearst's New
York American of August 10th.
The millionaire owner of the Independ
ence League takes the position that nigh
price cotton means high-price clothing
for the poor; hence such men as Liver
more, who try to put up the price of cot
ton, are doing a great wrong to the poor.
Will Mr. Hearst and his Independence
pay-rollers please answer these ques
tions?
(1) Were the poor people of the coun
try batter clothed when cotton was down
to six cents than they are now, when the
price is between ten and eleven?
In other words, how much of the bene
fit of six cents cotton went to the poor?
(2) What is the difference between the
amount which the farmer gets for a bale
of cotton and the sum which the spinner
gets when he sells the cloth made out of
the bale?
(3) How much does it cost the farmer,
on an average, to make a bale of cotton;
and how much does it cost the spinner
to weave the bale into cloth ?
(4) Why is that a Chinaman can buy
American cloth, in China, cheaper than
the American can buy it here at home?
(5) Why is it that Mr. Hearst does not
favor the placing of cotton goods on the
free list, in order that the poor, over
whom he editorially weeps, may be able
to buy cotton goods as cheaply as the
Chinese can buy theirs?
We trust that xMr. Hearst will detail
one of his editorial Independence Leag
uers to answer these question.
In the meantime, we take it that Mr.
Hearst has abandoned the hope of cap
turing the Farmers’ Union vote. Like
Bryan, he slaps the South to curry favor .
with the North.
By the bye — how low does Mr. Hearst
think that cotton should go?
As he complains of ten-cent cotton, and
did not complain when Theodore Price,
Joe Hoadley and others put it down to
six cents, we have some curiosity to know
whether five cents per pound for lint cot
ton would be low enough to suit our mil
lionaire Independence Leaguer, William
R. I ’earst.

Governor Smith and That September
Magazine.
Here and there —we are told —can still
be found a Hokeite who can not be per
suaded that anything happened after
September, 1907.
We deplore this. Many things hap
pened after Mr. Watson, in August of
1907, wrote the generous editorial com
mending Governor Hoke for what he had
done up to that time.
We do not claim to be a prophet, sooth
sayer, mind-reader, or anything of that
sort. We did not foresee that Governor
Hoke was going to become so well satis
fied with what he had already done that
he was going.to throw up the job. We
honestly believed that the program was
to be carried out in full.
The legislature had refused to pass the
anti-lobby bill, the anti-free pass bill, the
general Primary bill, and the purity-in
elections bill.
Each of these had seemed extremely
important measures during the campaign
of 1906. No evil in state politics was at
tacked more vigorously by candidate
Hoke than the evil of the early primary.
And he had appeared to recognize the
vast importance of the anti-lobby bill,
for he had personally assured Mr. Wat
son that this measure should be put
through, at the very first, so as to clear
the state-house of the corporation hire
lings who are paid to defeat reform legis
lation.
The programme called for a continua
tion of the speech-making against the
evils aimed by the Macon Platform. Gov
ernor Hoke pledged himself, in his speech
at Warrenton and on other occasions, to
sro into the counties of those members of
the legislature who had voted against
the campaign pledges, and denounce
them. He was certainly understood by
Mr. Watson and others to favor an extra
session, to be called before the next regu
lar session. He certainly talked in that di
