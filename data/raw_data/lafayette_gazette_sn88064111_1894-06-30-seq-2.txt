facetiously remarks that at the

empsesses the opinion that the

The following is about the worst
mr'we ever saw in a newspaper.
It is taken from the Bienville Ad
vance, a paper edited by one Mr.
Drew:
The people of the Soutnern portion of the
State are klosely allied to the mixed race and
accord the negro almost the same privileges
that the-whtes enjoy.
If the driveling idiot who wrote
the above infamous falsehood knew
anything about the condition of
ffairs in this section he certainly
would not have wasted the ink that
it took to print such an absurdity.
We hope for the good name of the
Louisiana Press Association that
this Mr. Drew is not the person by
that name who visited Crowley at
the last meeting of the association.
"I don't believe there are another
twelve men in the place who would
have found such a verdict," said
Mr. Erastus Wiman, of New York
when the foreman announced the
result of his trial. Other people
believe that their decison was a
foregone conclusion from the out
act. Mr. Wiman's contrition, his
willingness to make restitution, and
his purpose of amendment, appear
to be genuine. But the law never
acquits a culprit because he is sorry.
The facts and a confession of guilt
renadered any other verdict impossi
ble.
Mr. Wiman will be put in prison
for two or five years among men,
-the majority of whom are of an
settirdy diferent class,-men with
depgaved instincts, specimens of
e-r minal type, ignorant and obscure.

Ihave coai, i to y
befor thereaded s of your paper, a
fewr autb ties - raailtod masge
meat and railroad legislation, which
I believe wil' in a measure, if not
altogether counterbalance the views
of your esteemed contemporary.
The action of that joernal, to say
the least, was very inopportune,
when the threats by the management
of the Southern Pacific Company
against this community made after
the defeat of Mr. Mouton's bill, are
considered.
It is with reluctance that I enter
into this discussion, a.'t this parti
cular.time, and it is only a high
sense of duty that impels me to
defend what I conqrider to be the
rights of a free people, against
tyrany and oppression.
I will not attempt in a news
paper correspondence to refute
serial-it the several argumets pre
sented by that journal. For the
present I will only submit for the
consideration of your rtaders, a few
authorities on railroad management;
on the effect of railroad legislation;
on the cry of "we need more rail
roads" and on competition in rail
road traffic.
I will certainly not contest the
correctness of the position taken by
that journal that restrictive legisla
tion is detrimenal to the unre
stricted exactions of railroads. My
purpose is only to show that restric
tive legislation, against unwarranted
taxations by railroad companies, is
beneficial to the people to whom as
their masters, they owe considerate
treatment. On the cry of "more
railroads" and its effects under
certain circumstances, the Hon. Mr.
Taylor, U. S. commissioner of rail
roads, in his report to the Secretary
of the Interior on Nov. z x889, says:
"The unparalleled development of the vast
resources of the western states and Territories
has attracted capital there, and railroads have
opened inviting fields to minvestors. As a re
sult railroad building has been carried on
far in advance of the needs of the country,"
and again, "I believe that in many sections
of the West, conspicuously in the states of
Iowa and Kansas, the mileage of railroads
Is greatly in excess of the legitimate needs of
the carrying trade. If this be true, then
many of the investments in railroad proper
ties there must fail to yield rcnumerntive
dividends or the schedules of rates be fixed
so high as gto prove rirsously burdeuzonre
to traffic. For this unfortunate condition of
affairs neither the people nor the railroad
companies are wholly to blame. Both have
contributed to bring it about. The people
have encouraged railroad construction wher
ever it could be secured, regardless of exist
ing necessities or future compl'lications, and
the railroad companies have been unduly
eager to control trade by building new lines
and feeders for established ones where the
volume of traffic was not sufficient to support
them. This oadition of things present a
problem difficult of solution. It is safe to
say that the remedy is not in the levying of
extortionate charges or the waging of reck
less rate wars. The security of a railway
system lies in administering it with careful
respect to jrltice and the public welfare. If
its oppressive hand is laid too heavily upon
the people, revenge and revolt will be sure
to follow. If investors in railroad properties
have expended their capital in the construc
tion of lines not demanded by the present
trade, they must share the fate of all who
invest in improductive enterprises. Relief
can only come through .increased settlement
stimulating business and developing natural
resources."
So much to show that the cry of
"more railroads" should not be
heeded blindly; that railroad build
ing, llke any other enterprise, should
be gone into, only when population,
business development and the
natural resources of the country
justify it; that the people should not
encourage and investors shoud not
undertake, the building of railroads,
regardless of existing necessities or
future complication, and that when
ever these principles are ignored,
railroads are detrimental to the
public as well as to the investors.
On the question of railroad man
agement; or railroad competition
and necessity of the enactment of
restrictive railroad legislation, I find
the following in that same report:
He says.
"I do not agree with the claims so persis
tently made by railroad managers that the
recent loses sustained in railroad business
are mainly due to the restrictive laws which
have of late be enacted by Congress and in
many of the western states. Most of the
legislation for the regulation of railway
traffic within the Jiate has been wisely con
servative, and was as surely demanded for
the protection of the pnublic against atjns-t
hearges and discrismistios ii l&cal trade
as was the interstate commerce law to protect
commerce betwre the States.
SThe theory that the recognized laws of
trade (c.mpetition) would ultimately so far
prevail as to sufficiently regulate the mana
gement of railroads in the interest of the
public, has not proven to be a correct one.
Events have demonstrated that these laws
(of trade) have besome practically inopera
tive, and thit it is necussary to inVoke legis
lIerre to sS lement the operations of natu
ral laws in etablishing the legitimate rights
and cauao ing the mwrrrnted retenslions
oftntsportatio compatles."
That your readers, might not be
led to beleive that competition, the
recognized law of trade, to which
reference is made by Mr. Taylor,
does not need legislation to supple
meat it In this state, but that on the
contr&ry, railroads here are what
they are generally in this respect,
I. reproduce the syllabus of a
trlecisiaosi of the Su',teu Court of
sti cmpstidu, or so crease or faster

system tao agree to deride their
earuiangs for trac between given points, for
which they were previously competitors, is
qagainst public Interest,. coutrary to public
policy, and cannot be lUiciely eniorced.."
What does this decision show?
It shows, first, that the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company entered
into a contract with the Texas and
Pacific Railway company ond others,
to stit4e competition or to create or
Jfster a monopoly
ad* That the "high contracting
parties" had through and separate
lines between the two points, and
were, previous to the contract,
comepetisrg for all the traffic.
3d, That by an arrangement be
tween themselves they agreed to
divide their earnings between those
points, and to thus put a stop to
that natural law of trade--competi
tion-which railroad magnates, so
persistently claim will "ultimately
prevail as to sufficiently regulate the
management of railroads in the in
terest of the public.
Verily railroad 'manager use this
law of trade with very little consi
deration. When left at their mercy,
the poor thing writhes its agonies of
torture; they hug it, and caress it
so that it never sees the light of day.
As soon, however, that its disap
pearance is felt, they bring it up
again to be used, as a pretext and a
subterfuge. But such dexterity will
never blind the intelligent. The
above decision of our Supreme
court demonstrates that in Louisiana
as elsewhere, compeE~don, if we may
use the expression, do s hot compete.
Mr. Taylor, a sworn officer of the
United States Government, whose
duty it was to take all statistics and
other data concerning railroads,
says so too.
The above authorities are from
what I consider very high sources.
I know very little about railroad
management, but looking for light
and information I came across these,
and feel, that I, as well as a number
of other citizens, may, with con
scious satisfaction, differ with the
Advertiser and those it terms "many
of the more thoughtful people of
our State."
Iwill not encumber this article with
facts to show that railroad charges
to this place are excessive and ex
tortionate. The fact is too well
known. Nor will I argue against
the puerile position that railroad
freight rates of to-day are less than
when freight transpostation was
made in ox carts.

Electric Bitters has proved to be the very best.
It effects a permanent cure and the most

Electric Bitters cures by giving the needed

Remarkable Rhetoric.
From The Chicago Herald.
These be parlous times, accord
ing to the thinkers of advanced
thoughts, and the exigencies of the
sitruation have called forth numer
ous rhetoricians whose strong point
appears to be metaphar of the Sir
Boyle Roche variety. Not to men
tion Governor Tillman, who re
cently proclaimed that his armor
was an honest heart, The Nashville
American arises to annunce that '"a
upas tree is casting its deadly shade
over the bowels of the nation,"
while Oklahoma Sam, a silver
shouter of some repute calls upon
the people of the country to "rise
in their might and throw off the
yoke that is sucking their very vi
tals."
Anatomical metaphors seem in
deed to be in favor, for it is only a
few days since Marshal Carl Browne,
the hypnotic lieutenant of General
Coxey, declared that liberty had
been stabbed to the heart with
policemen's clubs--the stabbing
being done when he was hauled off
the grass in front of the capital by
one of "Major" Moore's myrmi
dons. It will be interesting to
watch the development of this cam
paign against the figures of rhetoric.

We are, 'it will be seen, far more

ter, in particular, are very careful,
and show great prudence in selecting
companions for life. It will also be
seen that women stand a better
chance of getting married in this
country than men, only so per cent
of ,them remaining old maids, whale
"3z per cent of the men are doomed
to bachelorhood. It is diferent in
Great Britain and all other countries,
where a greater percentage of ,the
men marry. The reason of
this is obvious--an excess of women
elsewhere, of men here. The
chances of a woman marrying in
the United States are 5 to z, in

Mormonism. one would imagin,
would have quite the contrary
effect.
As we imagined, there are more
marriages and more married people
in the cities than in the country,
the greater ease of comnaunication
encouraging matrimony. This is
particularly true of the south, where
the marriage rate is abnormally low.
In the matter of widows New Or
leans leads the country, as we have
noted It has also the smallest pro
portion of married persons of any
city, while Cleveland has the
lairgest, and is distinctively the
matrimonial city of tl.e Union.
Taking adults alone, San Francisco
leads us with the most old maids
and bachelors, with Boston second.
Some of the peculiarities can be
explained and conclusions drawn
from them, but others are quite
inexplicable. They show, however,
a high general marriage rate -in the
country, and as this (at least among
English speaking people) is regarded
as a'thermometer of prosperity, the
statistics are encouraging. It is im
possible to say whether marriage
has become more or less common
in this country, but it is certainly
not going out of fashion, for we are
getting married in far greater num
bers than ourEnglish speaking cous
ins across the Atlantic.

LITTLE THINGS.
A good-by kiss is a little thing.
With your hand on the door to go.
But it takes the venom out of the sting
Of a thoughtless word or a cruel sing
That you made an hour ago.
A kiss of greeting is sweet and rare
After the toil of the day.
And it smooths the furrows ploughed by care.
The lines on the forehead you once called fair.
In the years that have flown away.
'Tis a little thing to say. "'You are kind.
I love you, my dear." each night.
But it sends a thrill through your hearf. I find.
As we climb lile's rugged height.
We starve each other for love's caress.
We take, but we do not give:
It seems so easy some soul tabless.
But we dole the love grudgingly less and less.
Iill 'tis bitter and hard to live.
