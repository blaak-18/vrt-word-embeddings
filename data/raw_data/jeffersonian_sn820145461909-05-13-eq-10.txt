AN ANALYSIS OF THE TWO OLD
PARTIES.
(Continued from Page Two.)
Republicans in their platform and on
the stump were more strenuous in
their pledge to the people that they
would make a revision of the tariff
downward than even the Democrats
were, but the present session of con
gress makes it plain by their actions
that neither one or the other of those
parties have the slightest idea of a
government which their name im
plies. The Republicans instead of
striving to make this a government by
representatives of the people have
forgotten the people and are repre
senting trusts and combines. On the
other hand, the Democrats have for
gotten that Thomas Jefferson’s idea
of democracy was a government of, by
and for the people. They divide when
the time comes to burst the Republi
can ring. This action enables them
to organize and perpetuate the ring
in power. The people are not in it.
The ring dictates the legislation
that is to be enacted. The ring names
candidates for president, for gover
nors, for judges, for congress, for
State officers, for legislators, county
and city officers, aidermen and the
ring dictates the policy of all these
so-called public servants of the peo
ple, not only without consulting the
people but contrary to the well known
publicly expressed wishes of the peo
ple. Those political rings enforce
their dictum with none to molest or
make them afraid, for the ring owns
the parties and the parties own the
people, who are as much the slave to
their party as the negro was to his
master previous to the Civil War, and
as easily manipulated by the party
ring leaders as the negros were by the
negro drivers previous to the Civil
War. To this sad and helpless condi
tion have this' once free and happy,
prosperous people imperceptibly drif
ted. Seventy-three years ago the Uni
ted States had just passed through
two long and destructive wars and
conquered a peace with the then most
powerful nation on earth, besides
many wars with the Indians, and all
the obligations thus incurred were
paid. The people and municipalities
were practically out of debt and the
cost of maintaining our national gov
ernment, per annum, was hut a few
hundred thousand dollars. Now the
annual appropriation and expendi
ture of the national government is
over a billion dollars annually, and
the national governments bonded in
debtedness runs way up into the bil
lions of dollars. Every State and
municipalities are loaded down to
HON. THOS. E. WATSON.
Thos. E. Watson has thrown a
shell into the missionary camp. Os
course this meant that Mr. Watson
must put on his war paraphernalia.
He has so far proven himself a good
general against such antagonistic
foes.—Jefferson Reporter.
FAME.
A well known operatic conduc
tor once formed one of of a se
lect coaching party arranged by an
3effersotilan
their gunwales with debt, and when
the residents of the municipalities re
fuse to authorize more bonds then the
gang of ringsters get together and
form a league with legislators, who
are as ignorant of the wants of the
people as a native Chinaman, but who
straightway proceed to legalize bonds
in spite of the people who had pre
viously decided at the poles against
said issue. A counterpart to the his
tory we have been reciting of the
United States can be found by read
ing the history of the republic of
Rome, just previous to its downfall.
Every citizen of the United States, if
they have not got some work which
treats of the raise and fall of the
republic of Rome, should proceed to
the nearest library and read that part
of the world’s history, than sediously
reflect if they can afford to be a party
to the downfall of this republic which
has cost so much sacrifice in blood
and treasury to establish and main
tain to the present time. Let us see,
where we are in comparative history.
We will remember a sketch in Rid
path’s History of the World that a z
time came when Rome was invaded
and immediately the people fled to the
country and established themselves in
tents. At this juncture the former
leaders came to their camps and har
angued the people to turn out and
drive the invading enemy from their
territory.
To this the people with one voice
replied, No. We will not tight them.
We have got nothing to fight for. We
may as well be the slaves of foreign
enemies as the slaves of our enemies
at home. If you will relieve ns of
the debt burden (or words to that
effect) then we will have something
to fight for and when the invading
enemy is driven from our borders we
will then own our homes.
How far are the conditions of the
people of the United (States removed
from that of the Romans when their
country was invaded and they left
their homes and took up their abode
in
The bond obligations of people
which is a first mortgage lien on their
homes, is something fearful. Each
year, month and day it increases and
the donkies who secure offices and be
come the peoples’ business managers
are those who have the capacity and
disposition to be the most service
able to trusts and combines and as
soon as a public service develops, im
mediately they give it to one of the
ring to own and manipulate so the
people can never have an income and
be liable to pay the bond debts that
are constantly piling up against them.
