The Weather.
The weather surely deserves a
notice this week from our hands.
We notice ihat last Saturday, they
had a fair day at Shreveporf, with
some appearance of rain in the
evening. That [appearance must
have been the advance columns ot
the clouds which had been pouring
their waters upon us from about
nine o'clock in the morning. On
Sunday it rained i:i torrents from
the S. W. until three or four o'clock
when the wind changed to the X.
E. and at about 0 P. M., we had
another heavy rain, lasting an hour.
The town ditch was fuller than it
has been since the great lioods ot
1871. The commons back of town
were almost entirely submerged.
On Monday the rain began again,
soon after breakfast, with a cold
biting wind from the N. E. and
rained nearly all day. We had the
same on Tuesday, and a heavy rain
oil Tuesday night. On Wednes
day it looked as if it thought it
liad'nt rained quite enough, but af
ter moodily deliberating upon the
matter until Thursday, the clouds
broke away in sunny smiles, and
gave us warm and genial sunshine.
«Inst as we go to press it is pour
ing in torrents; our sunny smiles
are all gone and we are in despair.
T ue S kminolk .'—I 'lTis most' excel
lent Packet, in spite of the rain anil
wind of Tuesday and Wednesday,
which must have given her the heav
iest head-winds and most boisterous
river, of rho season, came up on
Thursday, and will go down to
morrow. But what did lier passen
gers in her snug Cabin, with soft
carpets and warm fires and easy
rocking chairs, and soft beds, and a
sumptuous table, care about wind
and rain. The officers were as smil
ing and accommodating as if they
had only had an April shower. She
brought us ; it would be unjust to
say, the late city papers ; it was ab
solutely a bale ; an armful of North
ern, Western and New Orleans pa
pers, for which we return them a
bundle of thanks twice as big.
Our young friend Compton French
is on board ready to accoinmodule his
o'd friends, in any thing they desire
in the Packet line.

The Finnncia! Record of
Reconstruction.
We believe that this should have
been made the prominent feature
on the part ot the citizens of Louis
iana iu the investigations before the
Congressionrl Committee. It is a
chapter in the history of Recoil
construction which cannot he de
fended, not even paliated, and from
whose investigation the. so called
Republican leaders shrunk with
the consciousness of guilt. It is a
history.whielns more than sufficient
to justify all the resistance and ha
tred which the South has ever ex
hibited against it, sufficient to have
warranted them in resisting it by
all the. means which (Jod has given
them. It is not that Reconstruc
tion has been forced upon them at
the point of the bayonet, nor that
the negro has been enfranchised in
violation of all constitutional law.
There is no constitution to the con
querer but the sword and however
much the people [of the South were
opposed to these terms when they
accepted them, it was their duty to
respect and abide by them. Rut
outside and beyond ail this there
is a chapter in the history of Recon
struction, mii comparison to whose
wrongs the pretended oppression of
the negro and ostracism of Radi
cal Innocents, sink into utter insig
nificance. That which ought to
%
have added more importance to this
chapter is that it is written in fig
ures, and'statutes which no preju
dice can distort and no perjurer can
falsity; and it is passing strange
that itshouhl have been overlooked,
or if not overlooked, left in the
background. The history of the
finances of Louisiana under Recon
struction, is but its history in South
Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia and
Arksnsas- In Louisiana the State
tax without a single public improve
ment, rose from \ of one per cent
or from Iii mills on the dollar to 21
mills. The Parish taxes even out
stripped the State, and in Natchito
ches Parish readied the enormous
taxation of G1J mills on the dollar.
Our State debt rose from about
$10 000 000 to over $10 000 000
The expenses of our legislatures in
creased from 870 000 to an aver
age of liait a million per annum.—
The cost of our Publie printing
rose from $30 000 to 8350 or $100
000 per annum. Unheard of mon
opolies deface the Statute books.—
Salaries fixed by the Constitution
are doubled, and quadrupled under
the guise, of Clerk salaries, and con
tingent expenses as illustrated from
the following extracts from the bill
for appropriations for general ex
penses made in 187-f, p. 90.

j 'ihe expenses of a government
I and consequent, taxation have ever
1 been considered the suiest barom
eterof political liberty. A tax roll
and appropriation bill among the
ruins ot Ninevah would throw
more light upou the condition of
its people than tons "of historical
manuscripts, (and centuries hence
the tax rolls and appropriation bills
aud «bartered monopolies will do
more to reveal the wrongs and op
pressions ami turbulence and law
lessness in Louisiana than the re
ports of an hundred Congressional
Committees of investigation.
It may be very philosophical and
the highest evidence of loyalty for
a citizen to stand by and see his
property day by day fiItched iroui
him, until his home is made deso
late aud his wife gatid children
brought to want and feel no resent
ment, or more than this, to stand
i»y and witness the cunning and
stealthy thieves fawning upon his
servants and hired laborers until
they aie induced to introduce them
within the inclosures which pro
tect his safety and his wealth and
as they dance in glee over his plun
dered substance, smile with com
placency and entitle them, honora
ble and receive them as .associates
and friends lïut, however, phil
osophical and loyal it may be, it is
more than poor Southern frailty
can endure and it is not to be won
dered at, that It should sometimes
grow mad with rage and swift in
vengence. The negro has done all
this. He has unbared the doors of
our treasury to a set of plunderers,
whose robberies are counted by the
millions and in comparison with
which, the robberies of every con
vict and every buglar and every
highwayman in the United States,'
combined, sink into utter insignifi
cance. Whose rights have these rob
hers uot invaded and trampled un
der foot? Whose homes in Louisia
na have they not made desolate and
yet they have been permitted to re
present themselves as persecuted
for opinions sake.
As we have stated we believe
that it was an oversight in not
making these wholesale robberies
the prominent feature in the inves
tigations before the Congressional
Committee; they would have thor
oughly explained, why some of the
innocents who have been ostra
cised could not stay at home.
The BemarkaUs Mineral Treasures
Discovered in Massachusetts.
The Scientific American gives an
account of the discovery of a Silver
mine in the little town of Newbury,
Essex Co., Mass., by a man named
Rogers, who in wandering ovei
LIighfield Pasture, noticed that the
old stones which he picked up and
had been thrown about as worthless
from the days of the Pilgrim fath
ers, were heavier than common
stones, and on examination discov
ered occasional gleams as the Sun
glanced on smooth surfaces. Fur
ther investigation revealed that
they contained silver, lead and
gold. The poor old farmer, who
had starved on these rocks was in
duced to sell his 12 acres for $350.
He is a living illustration that it is
no use to be a millionare if you
don't know it. The vein is what
is known as the fissure vein which
is always without bottom.
Here is a description of the mine
from which 10 tons are taken every
21 hours by S men, 4 working in
the day and 4 during the night, the
vein growing purer and richer as
they descend, and having liiereas
cd iu the depth cf 25 feet from 3 to
7 feet broad :
This vein is estimated l>v geologists to
extend iu its general direction, 20 degrees
east of north, about six or se veu miles in
length. Bearing this fact in mind, the
wealth to !><j reasonably expected from
this "find" can only lie estimated by com
parison. The Comstock lode in Nevada,
hitherto supposed to tie the richest silver
mine iu the world, yields only $45 per ton
on the average, while the Newbnryport
yields just double that. The Mariposa
mines, which were sold a few years ago to
a company for $iU,00Ü.ÜUÜ \ ield only $iä
per ton of silver. The Belcher mines in
Colorado, which yield about -$40 per ton,
divided $1)00,000 among the stockholders
as the profits of work during the month of
August, lri?4: and these mines had not
the additional profits accruing lroui the
product of lead.

The Arkansas Message.
The President's Arkansas Mes
sage is one of the most significant
documents that has emenated from
the White House during this Con
gress of significant messages. It
is not the first time in the history
of the world in which it has been
proposed to build a republican gov
ernment upon military foundations.
Sylla and Marius each did the
same ami ntter them Julius and
Augustus Cœsar. The absurdity
or such a thing is too apparent to
escape the detection of any body,
and especially such intelects and
statesmen as those who preside
over Gen. Grant. Rut notwith
standing this absurdity, there is a
state craft iu it of ambition and
unscrupulous determination. The
gaping multitude which they may
have doubted, have even acquiesc
ed iu its profession, until their ac
quiescence is no longer needed.
We have said that this Arkansas
message is the most significant
message that has beeu sent to this
Congress.
Without a complaint from the
people of Arkansas, but on the
contrary with congratulations from
every source that Arkansas has si
better government than she has
had since the war, but at the com
plaint of a dozen or more of unscru
pulous politicians whose only ob
ject is public plunder, the Presi
dent proposes to overturn the gov
ernment which has been in exis
tence for two years, and place
them in power. This proposal is
not on account of Arkansas but it
with the third term is an imperative
part of the scheme to perpetuate
the rule of the present party.- The
Jacobins of France never saw the
day in which they could have, hes
itated, retreated or laid down their
power without destruction and an
nihilation to themselves. The
present Republican,party find them
selves in the same fetters ot des
tiny. They have no more power
to mark, or change the course they
must pursue, than the cur
rents of the sea, or the Rivers to
change their course. They must
choose between-American liberty
aud their own destruction, and
they have not hesitated to make
the choice. Arkansas, Mississippi,
Louisiana, South Carolina, Florida,
Alabama, and peiliaps North Car
olina and Georgia, are to be bound
and fetered by Military power, un
der the pretcnce of securing to
them Republican governments,
while the ignorant and imbecile ne
gro who knows no more of republi
can government than he does on
the wilds of Africa, is to shout and
vote for the Third Term. The
masses of the North are to be starv
ed by contract.on under the pre
tence of returning to specie pay
ments, until the canvass ot 187(5,
when gold by the million, will be
massed ih the desired points

Bescher and Tilton.
[From the Chicago Journal ]
There has been nothing as yet so
tragic as the contemplation of Til
ton by Reecher. When his enemy
rose to take the vacant chair,
Beecher was whispering oornestly
to Judge Porter. The electric
shock which startled the audience
violently broke short that conver
sation. Looking up to see the
cause of it, Reecher found himself
face to face with Tilton. For a mo
ment the fascination stupefied him.
He grew paler and paler, until he
was whiter than he will be when he
lies dead. The change from his us
ual redness to worse than mortal
pallor was indescribable. He look
ed as if, with one huge gulp, his
heart lud swallowed every drop ot
blood in his hotly aud then had
stopped. lAs face wore an ex
pression of horror, as if he were
peering in a looking glass and
found Death grinning over his
shoulder. The appaiition of his ac
cusor was a stupendous surprise—
and, for au instant, it petrified him.
Uis recovery was slow. The shock
unnerved him, and he could not
escape Tilton's haunting eyes un
less he closed his own. Innocent
or guilty, with those relentless orbs
blistering his heart, any man would
have been angry. Tilton did not
look at Beecher. He looked into
him, affif Iiis body were nebulous,
with one torturahle spot iu the
.centre, which "the moon freezing
I crystal" of his sight could pierce
I l!ke au infernal pang.

The Iron Clad Oath.
The election of eighty-three Democrats
from the Hont h to the next Congress has
excited some alarm. They will bo the
majority of the dominant party in the next
House. If they are Admitted to seats, they
will rule the Democracy aiul the Demo
cracy will rnle the House.
Patriotic men have, in consequence, be
come alarmed, and are looking urotm<i for
a way to prevent the country f.illuig into
the hands of those who tried to wreck is
under Buchanan One of the measure
proposed is the re-establishment of the
iron-clad oath lor members of Congress.
Probably not ten per cent oj the member,
elect from the South can take this oath.
Wo learn that none of the three Democrat
elected from this Statu can do it.
The foregoing extracts from the
New Orleans Republican, is the
clearest exposition of the object in
reinstating it that we 'have seen.
Its boldness is in keeping with the
boldness which assurnes the right
of establishing republican govern
ments by military power. Its ob
ject, the destruction of the Demo
cratic majority in the next Con
gress, demonstrates that the rem
nant of existence of the present
Session will be spent in barring the
doors to the House of Representa
tives and Senate against the Dem
ocratic members of the next Ses
sion. What other scheme will be
devised for destroying that majori
ty is not yet developed, bnt it is
now becoming apparent that that
majority will be destroyed ami the
next Congress made subservient to
the canvass of 1870.
We have already expressed the
opinion that the deep foundations
ot that contest is in the question of
contraction vs. inflation. That the
plan of the contest had been as ma-,
turely considered as that of a mili
tary campaign. There are those who
think the Third Term the silly pro
jectofaweak ambition, and may
think the reestablishing of this
Ironclad a like measure ot weak
ness, and perhaps accident, but to
us they a part of the saine bold and
well matured plan. They are l>otb
means devised by men who fully
appreciate the mockery and jug
glery of the American ballot.
Whatever stands in the way of its
control in 1870, will be removed,
and whatever means are wanting
will be devised. The boldness
which does not hesitate to say to
the constituents of 82 Congressmen
that they have sent representatives
objectionable to their masters is au
earnest of how daring and unscru
pulous will be the means resorted
to. Nor will there be any to cry
sacrilege! Reconstruction has been
but a new role of the Provinces and
Satraps of Persia, or of the Provin
ces and Proconsuls of Rome, and
have made the name of American
Liberty a hiss and a bye word.
The world, and even ourselves will
look upon the campaign of 1876 as
the closing scene in the farce of
American Constitutional Liberty ;
and Ju ins C:esar Triumvir of the
Republic of Rome, and Cromwell
Protector of the Commonwealth of
England, and Napoleon First Con
sul of the Republic of France, will
find their counter part in the Pres
ident for the Third Term. Nom
