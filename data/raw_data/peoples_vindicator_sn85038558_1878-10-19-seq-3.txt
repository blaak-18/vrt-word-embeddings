At the solicitation of many friends, I

WM. PAYNE.
As an Indepeadent.
Doubtless many of our readers have has
witnessed what is known in the ver- of t
nacular of show people as "quick here
changes ;" those spectacles where a bigi
person appears as Mrs. Grundy in one cast
scene and the next moment is trans- His
formed into George Washington to all don
appearance. However rapid the most and
excellent of these transformiste may tha
be they are completely laid in the fatE
shade by Dave Boullt.
One month ago his anxiety for rad
ical unity, and his efforts for radical
success were equally manifest and Z
zealous, but to-day he is transformed moi
into what is known as an "Indepen- the
dent-Conservative." and
Boullt, as a radical, aided by all his wal
efforts, and if those efforts were not mal
successful it was no fault of his, to I
fasten upon this people and retain in wel
power the most vicious set of rascals Toi
that ever disgraced manhood. He Pie
has been personally "hand and glove" wit
with what is known here as the he
"crowd." He was the man marked Jul
in 1874 as a chief in the plunder of fel
our people, and when he fled from the zes
wrath of an outraged community he tic
returned with troops to dragoon she
them into submission, and terrorize ha
them by arrests that negroes might wi
rule and riot over the white intelli- tee
gent citizen of the parish and plunder wi
their property as was then being done. inc
This was but four years ago. In Vi
1876 he was the radical candidate for
sheriffand was elected and up to the w
moment of the riots was in full ac- ne
cord with the worst elements of rad- pe
icalism. To-day how changed. Be- no
hold the transformation! This fel- fc
low, hitherto and down to this mo- in
meot without an impulse for the good ce
of the community; nay, one of the p
leaders in their degradation and spo
liatlie, appeals to their suffrages as
an "independent-conservative." Ball! ar
Some few may be imposed upon by
the hypoeracy of Boullt, because he is
fully versed in simulation. Even we
hear itsaid that "he has been against
Blunt." Every word of that is the
veriest stuff. He stuck to Blunt be
cause Blunt was his hope, his god, u
and his talk was the cant of a
h~~oocrite, which could a -.ive no
n o'nitoches parish is determined
Blunt, BouCle-that no man, be he
msh nr other man, can
lie that attempts it wisthem and e
was never born. So far w We ef
fected our protection against sa
appalling danger without violence o
bloodshed, for the future we propose
to deal so sternly with those who at
tempt it that there will be no repeti
tion.
The VINDIOAROR has been a fair
adviser to those fellows in the past-
they had better heed what we say.
Leon Grappe announees himself as
"independent" for Sheriff. To our
knowledge be bhas sought to divide
the white vote as early as 1874, when
the wolf was at our firesides. This
year he sent word to Boollt that be
wouold not run if he (Boulit) intended
to, but it seems that he and Bollt
has made an arrangement whereby
Grappe is to ran and divide the whites
,--and thereby elect Boullt, when
SGrappe is to be asdepouty in payment.
sppe Ia a nice "baIr pon."
PU-gis
A SLANrDER.
The "Hill Waids" If this palii-h Ifa
are being menist foully hslti dl'iir h) , i an.ita
statement, which ~e have aullthlity now .
for stating is being most inmlist ious- condi
ly circulated, to the effect that da'te deter
Boullt, the "lttansforned Independ- best
ent.Conservative" is their candidate ends
for Sheriff. We have every reason will I
to know that such a statement has no teriol
foundation in truth whatever; that Boul
it is a slander used and circulated for that
motives which are perfectly apparent mani
--that of attempting to advance taugl
Boullt's interests; as an electioneer- whic
ing trick in his favor. t )nly that and Iii
nothing more. conti
Now such a slander as this reflects are
in a two fold manner upon those who shall
circulate it. In the first place all mate
good men must deprecate any divis- ity a
ion of the whites, and all good men Pe
should do what lies in their power to stant
promote unity. Such talk as this has has 1
a contrary effect, and is so intended. ing
Secondly, every man who supports or were
votes for Bonllt is a Radical. lle they
cannot escape that conviction, for it is lowe
perfect folly to suppose that so thin a A
disguise as "Independent-Conserva- treal
tive" could cover so well known a lman
Radical as he. are
'ealtytoa pae, and principle is the same
highest aim of a virtuous citizen. He fate.
may evince his displeasure at acts of G
the majority in any way save that of
bolting the ticket or supporting a Radi. pric
cal ; either of these is bad enough; Car
he may, however, do the former and his
thereby jeopardize the success of his itse
party and the principles for which he
contends, but when he does the latter
in this country lie becomes the ene- Rej
my of his race and of his people.
The motive for the circulation of
this slander is well understood where
it has been most industriously circa- ,1
lated-but we comment upon it as the
we have to show those w ho use it at tl
that they are understood, and in jus
tice to the Hill Wards who are thus Jufor
basely traduced. Con

Something Interesting.
d The action of Parish Judge Sim- E
I mons on Monday last in the matter of in
1. the preliminary tdial of the riotous by
and incendiary negroes of Ward 3, 0on
is was so very reprehensible as to de- spl
at mand the severest comment. or
to In the first place, these negroes
were committed for trial by Justice wa
sTocker on the order of Judge D. l
e Pierson; what Simmons had to do
Swith the matter we do not compre
he hend. At any rate, as soon as
d Judge Pierson departed for Mans
of field, Simmons evinces a great and
e zealous anxiety to examine these par
he ticolar cases; and right here decency
0 should have restrained him from
ie having any thing to do with a matter
ht when his intence partisanship would
i. tend to excite to a further degree our
ler white people, already aroused by the
e. incendiary acts of negro mobs undet
Svicious and unprincipled leaders.
or We are told by gentlemen of this
he ward, that there was not a single wit
et ess for the State summoned, but a
d- perfect cloud for the defence. With
e no District Attorney, nor no law of
el- ecer in that capacity to represent the
interest of the commonwealth, it is
od certainly the duty of the Judge in
he preleminary trials to do so. The
white gentlemen of ward 3, who had
been threatened with assassination
and incendiarism, came down voluon
by tarily, when the trial was postponed
until Monday next.
Our opinion is, that Simmons' ani
e iety springs from his inate desire to
he acquit these negroes, and not from
be- the impulse to promote the ends of
, justice.

His class must understand that the
