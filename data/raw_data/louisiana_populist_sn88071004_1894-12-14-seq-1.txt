People's Party Platform.
1. We demand a national Onr-ur
llrecy, safe, sotnd and flexible, is
sued by the general government
only. a full legal tender for all debt
lpumlic and private, and that with
out the use of banking corpora
tions; "a.jislt, equitable and efficient
means of distribution, direct to the
people, at a tax not exeeeding 2 per
cent, be provided, as set forth in
the sub-treasury plan of the Farm
ers' Allianee, or some better system
also by payments in discharge oat
its obligations for public improve
ments.
a. We demand free and unlimit
ed coinage of silver and gold at the
present legal ratio of 16 to 1.
b. We demand that the amount
of circulating medium be speedily
increased to not less than $30 per
capita.
c. We demand a graduate . n
come tax.
d. We believe that the money
of the country should be kept as
much as possible ill the hands of
the people, and hence we demand
that all State and national revenue
shall be limited to the necessary
expenses of the government, eco
nomically and honestly administer
ed.
e. We demand that postal sav
ings banks be established 'by the
government for the safe deposit of
the earnings of the people and to
facilitate exchange.
2. Transportation being a means
of exchange and public necessity,
the government should own and
operate the railroads in the inter
est of the people.
a. The telegraph and teleplhoce,
like the poet office system, being a
necessity for the transportation of
news, should be owned and opera
ted by the government in the in
terest of the people.
3. The land, including all the
national resources of wealth, is the
heritage of all the people, and
should not be wonopolired for spec
ulative purposes, and alien owner
ship of land should be prohibited.
All laud now held by railroads and
other corporations in excess of
their actual needs, and all lands
now owned by aliens, should be re
claimed by the government and
held for actual settlers only.

SOMETHING ON SUBS!DIES.
Old Man Lnarns From the Boy
That He's Made a Fool of
Himselt. i
Well. our gov, rnment hasl come
to its snses at 1 t-t. We shall soon
have a merchant marine that we
can he proud of.
What is a merchant marin-, pa?
Why, I mean trading vessel[.
D)on't we have trading ves~els
now ?
No.
I thought there werre lots of
ships coming in and going out of
our harbors all of the time.
So there are, but they all belong
to the blasted foreigners.
D)on't we own any ships?
Mighty few on the ocean, I tell
you now. Why! nearly all of our
wheat, meats, live cattle, cotton
and petroleum is shipped abroad in
foreign st:amship;.
Why don't we build and sail
ships?
We are going to after this. Why
just think of it, my son. The
100,000) Americans who visit Eu
rope every year pay the foreign
steamship cempanies $2~~,E0IY,4 M) a
year just for passage money. Oh,
its awful to think how this country
has been drained of money that
should have been paid to Ameri
can ship owners.
How does it happen, pa, that we
don't have ships now?
Oh, the tariff has been too: low.
We can't compete against the pau
per labor of Europe.
I)idn't we use to do a large share
of the carrying trade of the world ?
Yes, back in the "fifties" our
flag floated on every sea. At that
tim3 we had one-third of the ton
nage of the whole world, and did
one-third of the carrying trade of
the world.
How did we ever get those ships,
pa?
Why, we built them. The ship
yards of Maine, New Hampshire
and down the coist, were the busi
est places in the country. Now
they are as silent as a last year's
bird's nest.
Didn't there use to be paupers in
Europe, pa?
Yes. What do you ask such
a foolish question as that for?
There have always been papupers
there and always will be if they
allow kings and czars to stride
their backs as they always have
done.
I was wonlering if European
pauper labor kept us from build
ing them back in the "fifties."
Why--ah-why-let me see,
why, we must have had a big tariff
then.
No we didn't, the tariff wasn't
half as high then as it is now. The
Walker tariff passed in 1846 was
the lowest ever known.
W'ell, I--say, have you got that
job done that I put you at at?
Yes, and
See here, you go to sawing wood.
I must go to the store.
But, pa, you said when I got
done I could play.
Well run off and play then.
Wait a minute, ps; what did you
mean by saying our government
had come to its senses at last?
Oh, yes; why, congresshias pass
ed i law granting subsidies toa
Isteamship line that will now ena
ible us to float our flag.
What is a subsidy, pa ?
Why it means that the govern
ment will pay these favored steam
ers a certain amount of money
-each month. This in addition to
what they can earn in carrying
1bmimsM will eable them to com
Ipete with the Europeans.
How much money will the gor
Sernment pay these steamers, pa
860,000 a month.
Will every steamship line get
*6in,4t) a month R
No, no, only one line to Asiatic
ports, one to European and one to
South American.
Is it fair play for the govern
ment to pay one line and refuse to
pay it to other lines
Why; ah why you see it would
never do to try to pay it to all who
wish to build ships. It woul!
bankrupt us.
Now, pa, youi say thle gPoverII
iment which guarantees equal rights
t') all and special privileges to
none is giving such large sums to
one particulan line only'
Yes.
Where does the money come
from to pay these subsidies. Is it
collected by taxation i
No. Well yes, it amounts to
that; it is collected in various ways
but simmered down it is taxation.
Everylbody pays tax does he not :
Yes no one escapes except bond
holders.
These steamship companies that
don't get a subsily are taxed aren't
they ?
Yes, of cours th-ey are.
Everything has to he taxed a
little higher on account of the sub
sidies doesn't it .
'Why, yes, a little higher I sup
pose.
And these other lines running
steamships to-well, say South
America
Yes these are.
They don't get any sul~idy?
No. What of it? What are
you driving at now? You better
go to work, I'm busy.
Wait a minute, pa; I want to
show you how this thing will work.
(Old man interested). Well
Now, let us suppose for the sake
of argument, that that you was
the owner or a large stockholder
in the line that is not subsidized,
and old Jones who is bucking you
so hard in the grocery business
was the owner or a large stock
holder in the subsidized line, and
you were competing with each
other for the carrying trade be
tweemn the two countries. What
kind of a chance do you think you
would stand in the South Ameri
can carrying business?
Why! Why! by jove, I would
not stand any show at all. The
old rascal would simply put down
rates so low that I would run at
a loss.
Then what would you do?
Why I should simply have to
quit.
Is that all?
Yes, what else could I do?
Wouldn't you be obliged to sell
your ship?
Oh, yes, of course.
Who do you think would want
to buy ships that didn't pay to
runt
Why, no one of course. I hadn't
thought of that. By guma, they
would be a dead loss sure.
Isn't it probable that after a
while old Jones would employ
some secret agent to make you a
low offer for them?
Yes. It would be just like the
old scamp to do that very thing.
Didn't he serve me just that kind
Sof a trick oncet
How was thatt
Why that time that I bought up
- that 1,000 bushels of applesI, thiukl
'ing I had a scoop on him (apples
Swere awful scarce here that year)
and I got a hustle on me and en
gaged the Irop beforehand. No
- sooner had I got them nicely stored
- than old Jones shipped in a hun
r dred bushels from Michigan and
) beganto sell for lms than I paid.
rI moon saw that nnless I sold out
-i moon I shoald lose a good many, so
I put down the price and that old
- shark actually sent a stool pigeon
around and bought most of my
stock, then when I got out and sent
an order to Michigan for a spply I T
1 folund the price had goune up s
that I could not afford to sell in
comnle.tition with Jones. So I lost
my apple trade, my apples andl to
lots of money besides. fit
Now to go back to the ships of
again. Having got the sub- th
sidly enables him to not only drive th
you out of husiuess, but it enables th
him to get your ships also, and at it
a much lower price than be could c:i
possibly build them himself. Nor th
is this all, he can ablolu'ely pre- :,
vent any one else fromu ever put- E..
ting on a line of steamers. w
I see now, my sonl, the force of ti;
your relnarks. It's infamous. ia
Yes, pa, and lie can also put up11 i
the 'price of freights like lie did fit
his apples, when your stock was I
gone.
Yes, by Jove that's so too. Why, I
d-nÂº a subsidy, what a fool I've el
been to ever endorse such a thing. h:
I am surprised that you should
ever have done so pa.
Well to tell the truth all the pa
pers advocated suibsidies and tohld it
what a good thing they were and
like a fool I joined in the insane t
cry without ever stopping to in
vestigate for myself. Confounud
the papers anyway. I wonder it
they lie about every other thing
the same way!
Would it not be a good idea pa,
to investigate the money question
and the tariff question and
Yes, and the railroad question,
and the land question too. Say,
my son, that's Populism isn't it?
Pretty nearly so, I think.
Well, if it was to do over again u
I'd chance a Populist ticket at a 0
venture. P
You'll have another chance to
vote in two years, pa.
Yes, but it makes me mad to n
think I've thrown it away this time tI

bushwacking policy of figuring tl
with the old parties to secure a
nominations and elections of in- s

votes, will never accomplish any- s

is attained, and not till then, and n
in and through the People's party, t
can we hope for relief and the en- y

Solid Truth.
A thing is right or wrong, no
matter what you believe about it.
All the people in the world bmliev
ing a wrong would not make it
1 right. All the people once be
lieved the earth flat, but it was a
globe just the same. All of you
may believe in the "intrinsic" idea
of money, but it is a fallacy just
the same and as easily disproven
as the physical fact of the world's
shape, if you will but investigate.
You are always more positive in a
statement you have never studied,
can give no valid reason for, than
about things you have some knowl
edge. If a man disputed your
I method of spelling a word you'd
go to some authority to prove
- your position, and you would be
3 foolish if he brought you equally
3 good authority and more of them,
t if you should refuse even to look
' at them. But you do this very
tthing about political questions that
Sinvolve your very existence. You,
stherefore, deserve your present
conditions, you deserve poor pay,
discharge from employment, pov
erty and misery. These pressing
Syou hard enough will cause you to
use your reason or die, and if you
Sremain wilfully blind, and by it
- injure not only yourself, but thou
sands about you, your life is not a
Iblessing but a bane. Real up.
