"A Severe Throw-Down for the Admin
istration of Mayor Querbes."
In ihe Picayune of Tuesday, January
:0, is published in the columns of "Lat
est News in Louisiana" a special dated
at Shreveport January 19, of which the
paragraph quoted as follows is the
feature of ptominence although sand
wiched between other items:
"There was considerable discussion
e over the ordinance to provide for the
removal of screens' from saloons which
would -obstruct the view on Sunday.
The ordinance was defeated by a vote of
i- 8to 6. This was regarded as a severe
n throw-down for the administration of
n Mayor Andrew Querbes, who tried hard
e to get the ordinance through. An ordi
c nance was passed providing for the,
erection of safety gates at all railroad
crossings."
d Without assuming or presuming to be
e a champion of Mayor Querbes or of his
d administration, the Caucasian, without
n reserve or hesitation, must declare that
this statement is as ungenerous and it
is unfounded. There is manifest in every
a line of this exaggeration a spirit of po
litical antagonism which may have been
stuggested with the view and for the
purpose of reflecting discredit and odium
on Mayor Querbes and his a'dministra
tion, It will not be gainsaid fhor can it
be disguised that the recent •success of
I what is styled the Querbes v ing or fac
tion, in politics is regarded 1vith signifi
cance throughout, the State b!y all poli
ticians of practical experience and has,
as had been pointed out by the Caucas
ian, the agitation for the repeal of the
Sutiday law, precipitated on the public
recently was- designed in no friendli
ness for the Querbes administration.
The suggestion oa the repeal of the
Suday-ordinance was checked by a
demontstration of public sentiment and
the fact that even if repealed. the State
w w d o stand and that Mayor
sbes 'would give it loyal support.
B t thr is the, fact, the bold, stern fact

faricment;.-ird withrthis -condition Was
'the questipn whether the ordinance
should be withdrawn or permitted to go
to a vote for final decision. Candidly it
would not have been good policy to
have withdrawn the ordinance, afer it
had been submitted, and the only reas
onable and logical course was to permit
its acceptanbe or its defeat. After all.
the mayor has no authority to legislate;
his functions and duties require his en
forcement of all ordinances. It is true
the mayor suggested the screen ordi
nance as a means of simplifying the en
forcement of the Sunday law ordinance
by the police, but because the anti
screen ordinance did not become law is
no reason why it should be charged that
"this was regarded as a severe throw
down for the administration of Mayor
Querbes." What nonsense! How ab
surd !
"A severe throw-down" by whom?
Who are they who are numbered with
"this was regarded?" Are they friendly
politically to Querbes and his adminis
tration ?
Would not those who may be includ
ed in "this was regarded," etc., rejoice
in the apolitical undoing of Mayor
Querbes and his adminisgration?
How many of the number who may I
be connected with "this was regarded,"
etc., have evinced any sympathy, or any
appproval of the efforts of Mayor
Querbes in 'the enforcement of the r
law?
And all "this was regarded," etc.. has
emanated from one who is the repre
sentative of the Picayune'in Shreveport.
But the gentleman, perhaps, did not a
weigh or consider the meaning-nor the
reflection of "'this was regarded as a
severe 'hrow-down for the administra- I
tion of Mayor Querbes."

THE PLUMBING ORDINA..CES
AND THE PLUMBERS. *.
Shreveport, La., Jan. s3, 1903.--In
yesterday's Journal I notice an article in
reference to master plumbers' kick, in
which the paper claimed Mayor Querbes
upheld MAr. Gill. the plumbing inspector.
ii some cases he did, but in my case he
did not, as I had no kick about the
plumbing ordinance at all. My kick was
for the inspector going on my work sev
eral times a day and interfering with
my men. He was told by the mayor to
quuit it. There is not a master plumber
in the city complaining about the ordi
nance being enforced. but I certainly
have a kick comink when I am coim
pelled to do work strictly according to
the -,rdinance and others are not. I
know\\ whereof I speak, and can point
out work done since Mr. Gill has been
in office that is. not according to the
ordinance.
I also notice in this morning's Times
an article signed by Mr. H. E. Went
wvorth. better nown as H. E. Ward, that
tie M.aster Plumbers' Association are
kicking. I want to say as the secretary
of the association that it is a personal
affair and not the association at all. I
have been in this city five years, three
years as a journeyman and two years as
a- master, and will give any. man $ioo
to show nje where any work done by me
was atken out on account of being
faulty. In justice to all the inspector
should treat all alike and show no par- 4
tiality. Respectfully.
