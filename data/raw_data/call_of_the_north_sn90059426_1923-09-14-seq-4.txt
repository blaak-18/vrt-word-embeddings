ISITING IN AND AROUND
OWATONNA
FIELDMAN IS AS BUSY AS A
MONKEY PICKING FLEAS ON
CHILDREN’S DAY AT
THE ZOO
BY BANDSAW.
Owatonna, Minn. We slipped
into Owatonna just to look around
a bit. We looked everywhere for
the fieldman of the Invisible Em
pire, but couldn’t locate him. A lit
tle questioning revealed that he had
left for Kasson, so we made Lizzy
carry us to that town. When we ar
rived at our destination we received
the cheerful information that he had
left for West Concord. There was
nothing |o do but go to West Con
cord. At West Concord we looked
in vain for the Klan fieldman. We
couldn’t see any sense in trailing
that trotter around any more, and
gave it up as a bad job.
We heard a lot of things about
that terrible Klan in the various
towns where we stopped. In one
town a series of midnight explo
sions preceding a fiery cross
the whole community. It is said on
good authority that the village mar
shal, or whatever title they give
the preserver of the peace, who had
been sleeping for several hours when
the explosions awoke him, became
so frightened that he crawled under
his bed, and the best efforts of his
wife could not induce him to come
forth until many hours had sped
into the eternal past.
One fellow told us pretty straight
that a silabus, we guess that’s what
you call it, has been sent around
forbidding Roman Catholics to eat
eggs—BECAUSE THERE ARE
KLUX IN MOST OF ’EM. We
won’t vouch for the truth of the
statement, but give it to you for
what it is worth.
Late was the hour when we finally
found our way back to Owatonna.
We felt like a hot cup of coffee,
so went to where they make good
coffee, and soon were busy pouring
the Java into our iimers. We must
have reached the middle of the cup
when in walks the go-getter that we
had been hunting all day. At once
he told us about his wonderful car.
We couldn’t get down to his garage
—a vacant lot—soon enough. We
saw the “car”—yes, we saw it—the
four speeds forward and everything.
The Klancar had body lines that
would make a rain-barrel turn green
with envy. The fieldman was
quick to tell us that he liked the
car especially, not for its intrinsic
value as for its ease of storage, in
sisting that the dam thing looks so
harmless that nobody will think of
stealing it. We say they won’t.
The fieldman. told us a little ex
perience he had the other day after
a naturalization ceremouy. Klans
men were assembled in the Klavern
when a stranger tried to force his
way into the room. Several efforts
were made to drive him away, but
the cuss was persistent. When he
came back a fifth time the Klansmen
cornered the fellow and put him be
fore a lawyer for cross-examination.
“Say, look here,” said the lawyer-
Klansman, “you don’t belong here.”
He looked closer at the stranger.
“I’m sure of it. Ain’t you Jewish?”
“Shure, I’m Jewish,” answered
the intruder with an Ingratiating
smile.
“Well, don’t you know that the
Klan won’t admit Jews?”
“I don’t want to join.”
“What do you want then, any
way?”
I vant to see the fellow vot buys
the sheete.”
We knew that it was our place to
“tell another” and decided to fill the
place. So while we were guzzling
the coffee the following story came
forth:
June, who had just enjoyed her
fourth, birthday, was the center of
attraction at the Johnson home,
where more or less numerous rela
tives were gathered.
“Who do you like the best in all
the world?” asked Aunty Amanda
of little June between a changing
of the phonograph records.

CURIE COUNTY FAIR
HAS A YU KLUX DAY
Casey, 111. —Last Friday night the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan took
charge of the Clark County fair at
Martinsville with the result that the
largest crowd ini the history of Ca
<pey gathered at the fair grounds to
take part in the elaborate ceremonies
that were held.
After a well-known speaker had
addressed a multitude of people on
the principles of the Klan and was
applauded throughout his discourse,
a parade was formed and at about
eight-thirty started on its march to
ward the center of town, headed by
the Casey band.
The parade was by far the largest
and most spectacular ever seen in
these parts and the mammoth crowds
qlong the line cheered the marchers
continuously. After the parade had
returned to the fair grounds and dis
banded, which *was about ten-thirty
o’clock, a forty-foot fiery cross was
lighted and a cheer went up from the
vast crowd that fairly shook the
earth.
Day Is Big Success
A naturalization ceremony was
then held in full view of the vast
throng and a gigantic class of neo
phites was ushered into the Invisible
Empire.
The day was a tremendous success
in every way and the future of the
organization is assured in this vicin
ity. American citizens are flocking
to the call of the fiery cross and Klan
membership is growing by leaps and
bounds.
The ceremonies of the day were
conducted under the supervision of
Casey Klan, Realm of Illinois.

Editor Om Speaks at
Granada and Rushford
PEOPLE GATHER TO HEAR
ABOUT PROTESTANTISM
Granada, Minn. “Twilight” Om
spoke in the Cummunity Moviei Park
bo a splendid crowd that listened
and applauded for nearly two hours.
The Klan lecturer wore a beautiful
robe that added much to the meeting.
Most of the peaple here had never
seen a live Klansmam, and aware of
the fact, before. After the lecture
many men and women came forward
and presented their hands of greet
ing just to let the Klansmen know
that they not afraid, and as a
testimonial that they didn’t believe
all the fiction that had been printed
to discredit the Invisible Emipre.
Rushford, Minnesota.—Somewhere
around a thousand people assembled
on the street in front of the Klan lec
turer’s automobile here last Satur
day. This was ‘Twilight” Ora’s sec
and appearance in this city. There
was iron in the speaker’s blood, for
he turned on the attackers of the
Klan in a way to leave no doubt in
any person’s mind as to the source
of the anti-Klan attacks that were
recently featured in the daily press.
In a loud voice Mr. Om asked the
question, “Who discovered America?
When he answered his own question
by stating that Lief Ericson was the
real discoverer of America, a wild
applause broke out.
The Klansmem here are doing
things effectively to make Rushford
a better place to live in. The Cath
olics are cussing them roundly, but
are helpless in that the Protestants
of this town have enough stiffening in
their backbones to stand fearlessly
for the right unafraid of the usual'
Catholic methods—boycott and vio
lence.
The Klansman father awaited the
answer breathlessly.
“Dess I like mama the bes’ ” said
June.
“Who do you like next best?”
“You, Aunty 'Manda.”
“Who next, June?”
‘My puppy dog.”
The Klansman father was puzzled
and asked, “When do I come in, June,
dearest?”
“Two ’clock in th’ momin’, Daddy.”
PENNSYLVANIANS ARE
FLOCKING TO KLAN
STATE-WIDE AWAKENING OF
PROTEST AN IAN S RESULT
OF MOB ACTION.
Five hundred fiery crosses will
blaze in five hundred Pennsylvania
towns during the coming week, show
ing that the spirit of Klansman Thom
as R. Abbott, foully murdered August
25 at Carnegie, Pa., still marches on
ward.
Klan activities in Pennsylvania
have been inaugurated during the
past few days on a gigantic scale and
thousands of Protestant Americans
are enrolling themselves beneath the
American flag and the fiery cross.
Ten thousand Pennsylvania Klans
men attended a great naturalization
ceremoial at Scottsdale, Pa., Septem
ber 1. State troopers patrolled the
line of march, guaranteeing the con
stitutional right of public and peace
ful assemblage to American citizens.
The parade was through the streets
of this Pennsylvania town and was
witnessed by 40,000 people according
to estimates of the Pittsburgh daily
newvpapers. A thousand aliens were
naturalized into the Scottsdale Klan.
Parades in Pennsylvania will continue.

GREENVILLE PENNA.,
HAS BIG CEREMONY
Greenville, Pa. Visitors from
Sharon, Mercer, New Castle, Butler,
Beaver,-and other nearby towns, wit
nessed the parade and initiation of
the Ku Klux Klan here last week.
That the ceremonial was to be held
was common knowledge throughout
Mercer county, and interest in the
event was keen.
The parade started at 8:30 in the
evening and was led by Klansmen in
a large touring car bearing a cross
affixed to the radiator and lighted by
red electric bulbs.
The initiation took place in Boul
gers field, and was an impressive
ceremony. Speeches were made by
several prominent persons. Follow
ing these speeches, which were ex
planatory of the principles and ob
jects of the Klan, the actual initiation
of candidates took plaee.
It is estimated that about 3,000
people were present and witnessed
the ceremony.

CROSSES BLAZING ON
CALIFORNIA HILLS
Los Angeles, Cal.—Fiery crosses
blazed along the hills of the Rincon
in Ventura county, a few days ago
when Klansmen of Santa Barbara,
Ventura and adjacent towns staged
an automobile parade and
ceremonial.
About three thousand Klansmen in
full regalia gathered at Stanley Park
in Santa Barbara county and inducted
one thousand aliens into citizenship
of the Invisible Empire.
Thousand of people witnessed the
procession of automobiles which car
ried the Klansmen through many
small towns and villages. The mo
torists were in the full regalia of
the order. Many of them carried
fiery crosses made of red roses while
the American flag was in evidence all
the way down the line. '
This is one of a series of demon
strations planned by the rapidly
growing Klans in this section of the
Realm of California.

The names of those arrested In

riot which resulted in the murder of
Klansmen Thomas R. Abbott of Atlas
burg, Pa., are as follows: Patrick
McDermott, Michael Hays, Walter K.

The American flag carried by the

trampled and filth bespattered in a
gutter near the Glendale bridge.
—K-K-K
The name of the Deputy Sheriff
of Allegheny County who halted the
Klan parade is Jack Dillon. The
burgess or mayor of Carnegie who
objected to the parade is John F. Con
ley. Both are said to be Roman
Catholics. '
—K-K-K
At the State Convention of the
Ancient Order of Hibernians held in
Pittsburgh, Pa., a few weeks ago, one
of the speakers urged “combat” with
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan or
other hooded mobs.” Other inflam
matory speeches were made which ap
parently have had their effect.
Did you hear about that fellow who thought Sodom
and Gomorrah were man and wife and that the epistles
were the wives of the apostles.
Did you hear about that-Klansman who became “sore”
because we couldn’t send out any more free copies of thei
Call of the North?
Did you hear about the fellow failing to recognize his
wife on a downtown street, took off his hat to her and
treated her like somebody else’s wife?
He must have been forgetful.
Klansmen who are not getting the Call of the North
must be forgetful
They want their Klam paper but just forget to sub
scribe for or buy it by the copy.
By the way, how do you like your Klanijpaper? A
mighty fine “sheet,” eh? And it’s getting better.
We know you don’t want us to keep on sending the!
Call of the North for nothing? We simply couldn’t afford
it.
So make arrangements to get your paper regularly.
We must have your support to keep it go ing.

KLAN IS FORMED ON BOARD
BATTLESHIP TENNESSEE
The Invisible Empire has a “float
ing Klan.’'
It is U. S. S. Tennessee Klan
Number 1, and its Klavern is on
board the United States battleship
Tennessee.
When the big battleship was at
Bremerton navy yard near Seattle,
Washington, a number of sailors
stationed aboard her organized a pro
visional Klan and applied to the Im
perial Palace for a charter.
The Klan will be chartered under
the Realm of Washington.
When you meet an out-of-town
Klansman do your best to make him
feel at home. Take him to your
Klavern and let him feel that the
practice of Klankraft is universal.
