There is one liase of the l-el 'nit
interfeirenCe which has ibeen atn o

promptly called attention to it. It is
not claimed that the Gen tiat iv

vote and electioneer for a ianitilafte

But it so happens tha t hle elecit ions

two Common Pleas Judges, the elec

election of Magistrates and other of

members of Congress, were defeated
by the exercise of this lawless law.
The statute is to be employed else

Judge Isaac Caldwell, of Louisville,
has finely mwet the 'iih consaitiut io

the scheme of inteireren-e. lie sass:
"It is not, in my opi' , a legai-

the Constitution whir: can be claini
ed to support it viz: the power in Con
gress to make regulation presc iihing
thme times, places and maniner of hiol
ding elections for Senator a(d lie
presentatives, since it clearly makes
no regulation for the time, place or
manner of holding the elections. nor
does it alter the time, place tr lan

but, on the contrary, leaving thu
State laws which fully ple eem itin in
great detail the time, platce and maim -

comirag is a menace and an iistlt an
the part of the central power to the
lawful oflicers of' Kentucky, wlihsos
duty is to hold an open, free and lair
election."
This point is well taken. The law
of 1571 neither wakes nor alters re
gulations as to the times when, plices
at which, or spanner in which ,the
elections shal be held- thme only
thing Congress can do in tie psize
