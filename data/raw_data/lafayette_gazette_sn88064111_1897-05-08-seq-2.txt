A SIGNAL VICTORY.
The Democratic party of the
town of Lafayette has won a signal
victory over the allied forces of
Republicanism, backed by Demo
crats who are oftener found in the
enemy's camp than in the ranks of
the party of which they profess to
be members.
The municipal ticket, nominated
by Democratic primaries, ordered
and held in the regular way, was
elected by a handsome majority,
defeating the so-called People's
ticket by a vote which leaves no
doubt as to the temper of the
voters of the town.
The election of the ticket headed
by Hon. Chas. D. Caffery, is not
only a significant victory for the
Democratic party, but it gives
assurance of an intelligent and
honest administration of the town's
affairs for the next two years. The
Democrats had very wisely selected
only trustworthy citizens and relia
ble business men to form the
municipal ticket and now that
their choice has been ratified, our
thriving little city is assured two
years of good government.
_DEMOCRA CY AND THE
DINGLE Y BILL.
It is as clear as the noonday sun
that if the Democratic theory of a
tariff for revenue only is the correct
one, Senator McEnery, Congress
men Broussard, Davey and Meyer
are wrong in voting for the Dingley
bill. It is equally clear and incon
trovertible that if the Republican
theory of a revenue for protection
is just and beneficient these gentle
men are right and should be
praised, not censured. If by
voting for the Dingley bill Senator
McEnery and the three Louisiana
Congressmen are doing a wise and
proper thing, the Republican policy
of taxing the many for the enrich
ment of the few is fair and just,
and the Democratic principle of t
taxing the people for the purpose of
running the government and not
for the benefit of a favored class, is t
defective in wisdom.
Both cannot be right, Democ- S
racy and the Dingley bill. And c
the Louisiana Legislators cannot be s
conscientiously in favor of the two. 1
By supporting one they oppose the t
other. They cannot vote for the }
Dingley bill and remain true to the t
fundamental principles of the party t
of Jackson and Benton. That is t
clearly impossible.
If Democracy means anything it
means opposition to protection
through a high tariff. The Dingley I
bill proposes the rankest kind of
protection. There is nothing
Democratic about it. It is more
undemocratic than the McKinley i
bill which was denounced by the
party through its representatives i
and its platfo rms. No Democrat
can consistently vote for it. No
Democrat should vote for it. No
Democrat will vote for it-if he
wants to do his duty.
VOORHEES' ROMAN VIR- t
TUE.
Baton Rouge Advocate.
It has for some years back been a
the custom to refer to the United t
States Senate as the "Millionaires I
Club" and the popular impression
of that body is that it is composed Z
only of rich men. As a matter of <
fact there are several millionaires in =
that body, the larger proportion of r
whom hail from the mining States
of the West, but by far the larger r
proportion of the Senators are poor i
men. This fact is forcibly illus- ,
trated by the following anecdote re- i
ported by the Chicago Record in at
receIt issue:
During the closing hours of the a
Fifty-fourth Congress, three mem
bers of the "Millionaires' Club," as
the Senate has often been called, s
were sitting in a committee room I
condoling with each other over the
expiration of their public life.
Said one of them, and he came
from an Eastern State: "I have
an ofter from a business concern to
look after its business interests in
,y ashingtozn which will pay me
about as -lmuch as my senatorial
salary,. and-I think I will accept it.
. If I do," hiwever, T slihll have' to'
give up all hope of re-election and
consider my political career ended."
S"I would be mighty glad to give
a up my political prospects," said
No. 2, who had been in public life
- for more than a third of a century,
"for such a job, or anything else,
for that matter, that will bring me
bread and buttel I have lost all
my practice, anl will be mighty
e hard work for me to get it back
t1 ýgain. I haven't slightest en
f Zburagement for ai future. The
only thing that I can do is to go
back home, work in my garden,
e and raise enough vegetables to feed
f my family. I have decided to try
, it, and wait for something to turn
up."
"I have no home to go to. I
have no garden to work in, and I
I haven't enough money to parr ex
s penses there if I had one," said
Senator Voorhees, who was the
third member of the groEtp. "I
have been in public life since x86i,"
he continued, "thirty six years, and
all the money I have is in my
pocket this morning. I dcn't know
I what I am going to do." And in
melancholy tones, often with a sob
in his voice, the venerable Senator
described the hopelessness of his
I future.
There is something strangely pa
thetic in such an experience as this
of a man who had absolutely de
stroyed himself in the service of his
country. During the thirty-six
years of his congressional career
Mr. Voorhees had been called upon
hundreds of times to cast his vote
for measures involving the appre
ciation of many millions of dollars,
and out of which other men made
vast fortunes, yet with the fidelity
of a Roman sentinel he discharged
his duty, and stood unmoved in the
presence of temptations that over
came others of less heroic fiber.
When in 1893 he abandoned the po
sition he had formerly occupied on
the financial question and cast his
vote and his efforts to the repeal of
the purchasing clause of the Sher
man act he was loudly denounced
by some silverites and intimations of
corruption were freely indulged in
by the newspapers of the country
which supported the policy of free
silver.
Called upon every year to vote
away many millions of the public
funds, not a dollar of it stuck to his
fingers, never once did he prosti
tute the privileges of his high posi
tion for the sake of gain; and
though he had by his vote helped
to provide honors for many of his
countrymen, and had passed neces
sary bills out of which many were
enabled to reap vast fortunes, him
self died without a home, and as he
pathetically expressed it "without
the means of reaching one even
had he owned it." What nobler
tribute could be paid to the charac
ter of any man than is implied by
these facts.
What Pleases a Woman.
Picayune.
It pleases her to be called a sen
sible little woman.
It pleases her to be called a well
dressed woman.
It pleases her to be told that she
is fascinating.
It pleases her to be told that she
improves a man by her companion
ship.
It pleases her to depend on a man
and pretend she is ruling him.
It pleases her to be treated cour
teously and with respect and to be
talked to reasonably.
It pleases her to be treated sen- 1
sibly and honestly, to be consulted E
and questioned and not to be
treated as a butterfly, with no head
nor heart.
It pleases her to be loved and ad
mired by a man who is strong
enough to rule and subdue her and
make his way her way, to lead her
and take care of her.
A western editor wrote: "While
riding on her wheel the other even
ing Miss-------- lost her path and
wandered around till dark." The
intelligent compositor made it read
that the unfortunate female bicyclist
had "lost her pants and wandered
around till dark."
A bright, Boston boy, who had
read the papers, upon being asked
by his teacher to namt the princi
pal products of Kansas, replied:
"Cyclones, cactus, boot-leggers,
hell, whiskers and hair."
