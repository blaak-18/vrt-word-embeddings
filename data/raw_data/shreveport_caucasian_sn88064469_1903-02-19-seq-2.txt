THE LIVING ROOM 0
AIDS&TO PRACTICAL AND ATTRACTIVE
HOUSE FURNISHING.
A Place For General Service, Com
fort and Pleasure-Selecting the
Wall and Floor Coverings-Furni
tore of an Antique Fashion.
A strong plea is made for the living
room in these words of an English
architect of reputation:
*i.et us have in our houses a room
where there shall be space to carry on
the business of life freely and with
pleasure, with furniture made for use."
A writer in the Delineator enlarges
upon this theme as follows:
Individual occupations may claim
the library, studio .r study; the little
A FIREPLACE FOR COMFORT.
children and older people the nursery
and sitting room, and the formal re
quirements of the Hlousehold the par
lor and reception room, but the living
room is distinctively for general service,
unique in usefulness and a continuous
source of pleasure in its realization.
In homes where a living room has al
ways existedl life without it seems im
possible. Unlike other rooms that may
be completely furnished from the out
set, the living room is a thing of
growth. It may begin in a very un
pretentious way and assume impor
tance with time and the development
of family interests.
In a living room two of the most im
portant factors in securing the "liva
ble" quality are the wall and floor cov
erings. If these are heavily patterned
and glaring in color, the initial step
toward securing the ideal living room
has been in the wrqng direction. Walls
of quiet color, in one or two tones, and
rugs or carpets in well mixed and un
aggressive patterns should be secured
in a quality as fine as is consistent
with the rest of the furnishings.
In planning ftr the floor covering for
the living room it is necessary to con
sider both the practical and the artistic
merits. One large rug will be found to
answer the purpose of this apartment
better than a carpet or small rugs. A
large rug may be removed and cleaned
A¶thout ,the disarrangement occasioned
by the taking up of a carpet for spring
and autumn cleaning.
Among the cheaper grades of rugs
are the Japanese jute or cotton. These
are found in many pretty designs and
colors, but their wearing qualities are
not as satisfactory as the domestic
Smyrnas. The latter are made now
after the designs of antique Persian
rugs and in a greater variety of color
than formerly. The rugs being reversi
ble give a double amount of wear. A
Scotch rug that resembles a high grade
of ingrain carpet and is inexpensive in
price is made in Morris patterns in
unusual and artistic combinations of
color.
. The furniture for the living room
cannot be better chosen than from the
old time pieces of mahogany or the
popular mission pieces made at the
present day. Very comfortable fur
nishings for a liv-ing room 'may often
be gathered from different parts of the
house-a Morris chair' for one member
of the family, a low rocker for another,
a divan with attractive cushions, an

old fashioned secretary, with pictures
and books that satisfy all the members
of the household.
Draperies for the living room should
be chosen with great care. In wide
doorways thick hangings should be
hung from the poles without any loop
lag back, ready to draw together for
the exclusion of outside sounds and
sudden drafts of air.
In an Interesting living room that has
been established on the uppermost
loorof a suburban house there are space
for good ventilation, a fireplace o en
eroes size and longer daylight than
below. Here one is free from the fric
tion of household machinery, yet still
in touch with the comforts of life.

Uncle
Sam's Balloon
Builder
[Special Correspondence.]
Frankfort, N. Y.. Feb. 9.-There are
farms all up through the Mohawk val
ley, but there is only one balloon farm,
and Frankfort possesses that. Balloon
farms are not of common occurrence in
any part of the world, and the people
of this little town are justified in tak
ing great pride in the place where Pro
fessor Carl E. Meyers makes experi
ments in aerial navigation and evolves
ingenious devices to carry a man
through the air. The professor is at all
times a very busy man, for the United
States war balloons are made by him,
and winter and summer he is to be
found at work on the huge silken bags.
By preference he does the greater
part of his work in the summer, be
cause balloon farming, as he says, is
like other farming, and It is necessary
to make hay while the sun shines.
Sometimes, however, Uncle Sam sends
in an imperative order that gives him
no choice, and he at once resorts to a
INFLATING BALLOONS ON THE LAWN AT
PROFESSOR METERS' FARM.
hothouse system of balloon culture, in
vading even his parlor in the search
for a place where the freshly varnished
silk can dry rapidly.
He is at all times willing to talk
about his occupation and will go to
great pains to give the visitor to his
farm an adequate idea of the industry
that is carried on there. He soon lets
his guest know that balloons, like pri
vate yachts, are not things in which
the average person can indulge, point
ing out that a three man balloon from
twenty-eight to thirty feet in diameter,
with netting complete. will cost from
$500 to $1,500, according to the grade
of material used.
In the higher class balloon the pro
fessor uses pongee silk principally.
This comes in pieces about nineteen
yards long and nineteen inches wide
and is sewed together, in strips 100
yards long before being carefully var
nished. These strips have then to be
thoroughly dried, else the complete bal
loon would be a failure.
Mrs. Meyers is as great an enthusiast
as is her husband, and like him ,she
does not believe that a careful aeronaut
can ever meet with disaster. She her
self has made many ascensions and
holds the record for the highest ascen
sion made in America with a natural
gas balloon. It took place at Franklin,
Pa., several years ago, Mrs. Meyers as
cending over five miles. Just how high
she really did go can never be known,
for she went beyond the recording
limit of the aneroid barometer with
which the balloon was equipped. Her
knowledge of air currents is wonder- I
ful, and the professor relates how it en
abled her on one occasion to make an
ascension in Utica and land at their
home, as she had said she would do.
It Is not only in balloon making that
Professor Meyers can lay claim to fame,
In 1900 there was exhibited at St.2
Louis an aerial torpedo manufactured
by him. This little machine, for the
model shown was only about thirteen
feet long, gyrated around the big area
in which it was exhibited. acid its evo
lutions were a source of perpetual mys
tification to the experts. The motive
power was in evidence, for the wires
through which an electric current was
furnished trailed behind it. But the I
problem was to discover how the oper
ator, seated at his switchboard on the
floor of the exhibition hall, could make
the machine rise, dip and revolve. That
part of the little ship's demonstration
remains a mystery yet, for Professor
Meyers declines to give the necessary
explanation.
It Is expected that the war depart
ment will put the aerial torpedo
through a series of tests at the balloon
farm lpre this summer, for if It fulfills
the elins of its inventor it would be
found very serviceable to drop torpe
does on the forces or ships of an .en
emy.
The latest device to originate In the
orofessor's fertile brain is an airship
built on new lines. Its inventor is cer4
taro that he has solved the problem of
dirigible ballooning. A model of the
new airship Is now hanging from the
ceIling of a large room in the "farm
house," and Professor Meyers promises
that before long .a practical machine
patterned from the model will be ready
for use.
The completed airship will be 45 feet
long and 15 feet In diameter; but, ac
cording to his description, it will be a.
great deal lighter than any other form
of airship. The motor will be novel, a:
kerosene explosion device. Kerosene,
;Pofessor Meyers declares, is the only
lotlvujpower that can be-*pplled o air
