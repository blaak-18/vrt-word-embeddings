3y Mr. Conger
To the Mayor and City Council: We
e .he undersigned property holders of
- Spring street and vicinity, respectfully
tsk that you repeal the ordinance sub
" mitting to a vote the proposition to
close Spring street by the Kansas City
s Southern railroad, for the following
reasons:
e First, the road has plenty of land for
t any depot it may see fit to build, with
out closing the street.
t Second, it will close one of the two
e cemaining thoroughfare; leading into
that section of the city, and will depre
t ciate the value of the property.
Third, it is against the interest of the
city to close any of its thoroughfares,
Sspecially any of its important streets.
d Fourth, the ordinance submitting the
d proposition to a vote is not fair, for it
e eaves the voters under the impression
r at it is a trade in which the railroad
e company gives Market street for Spring
street, whereas it is not theirs to give.
The proposition boiled down amounts
t to this: We give them Spring street and
'hey allow us to expropriate and open
1e tp Market street, a right we already
f have.
Fifth, with the unlimited means the
railroad has at its disposal to push this
wrdinance. it may be carried, to the
arcat detriment of the city through the
inability of the voters to post themselves
is to the merits of the proposition.

Shreveport, La., March 21, 1903.-To
the Mayor and City Council: We the
undersigned citizens and property own
ers of the city of Shreveport residing
in wards Three and Four, or otherwise
interested in the extension of steret car
service in this part of the city, respect
fully petition your honorable body to
again take up the proposition of the
Shreveport Traction Company, with a
view of granting said company a fran
chise to extend their lines along Jordan
street, White street and Stoner avenue,
to conneet with the line now being con
structed on Marshall. street, and from
Jordan .see a ing Irving plaee to
t- k pry ffor in
part as cited in their petition noww be
fore you.
WVe the undersigned believe that the
1) ilding up of this part of our city only
aivaits the street car, that our best in
terests ,b.1 be subserved by the grait
ing of said franchise, that it will be a
saving to the property owners in the
(,".I of paving where said lines are ex
tir'iied along streets to be paved and.
that if this matter is delayyd until said
street, are paved the extra cost of con
struction w~ill be so great that street car
coil,wptlmes will not care to construct
lines along thent for mtanv year . AV(
wvould i uther state that thins petition i
not inttended to intfluence the grantt.,g
of a franchise to construct lines that
will in any way disturb or detract fr :!
the service now in effect from Iordt i
street along I)onovan street tothe ci: .
but rather to improve same. as tht i
the short line to the city from tlit r:1"
of town. and we would not have it in
