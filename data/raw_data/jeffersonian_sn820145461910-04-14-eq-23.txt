A Primitive Baptist’s View
of Missions
Dear Sir: —I take your paper and
am well pleased with same. I heartily
endorse what you have to say about
Foreign Missions as far as you go,
but you only condemn the financial
and immoral part.
I have thought for a long time
that there was never a greater hum
bug practiced on the people than the
modern mission system. And I feel
if there ever was a time for the Gos
pel to be preached it is now, and that
beginning at home.
Now pardon me if I should give
my views on the Bible teachings as
I understand it. Christ said to the
Jews first, then to the Gentiles —
First at home then abroad. This you
have set forth from a moral and
a financial standpoint.
Now the subject is, What was the
intention of the Gospel? Paul says,
“ ... it pleased God by the
foolishness of preaching to save
them that believed.” First Cor. It
would be well for any one to read
whole chapter. Now we are
taiTMit that a believer is one that has
betVxborn of God and not a dead sin
ner}& For whosoever believeth is
borzZ&of God, so says the Bible.
No\ * know that no dead sinner is
caps mted to have an understand
ing, han<Y en to believe until spiritual
life carted. Then how does life
comf' The same writer says,
“Yod tath He (God) quickened who
were uead in trespasses and in sin.”
Then‘dead sinners are quickened in
to life by the Spirit of God. For the
Bible says it is the Spirit that
quickeneth, the flesh profiteth noth
ing. Then we see how a poor dead
sinner fs made capacitated to love
and believe. Now until this is done
the Gospel can have no effect at all,
for no where in the Bible >s it ex
pressed or implied that God uses the
Gospel as a means of quickening
into life, for the same writer says, I
received it not of man neither was I
taught it of man, but by revelation
of Jesus Christ. So it was after this
principle that Christ said unto his
disciples, “Go into all the world and
preach the Gospel to every crea
ture.” Preach means to teach or in
struct. Knowing that the Spirit
would go ahead and regenerate the
heart born into the Spiritual king
dom, that they might be prepared to
receive the Gospel, for the Bible
says in every nation, kindred and
tongue the Lord has a people. But
one says, are we not all His chil
dren? We are by creation, but not
by regeneration. Now Paul says
again, “It was through the Gospel of
Jesus Christ to bring life and im
mortality to light through the Gos
pel.”—2 Tim. 1:10. So we see that
the Gospel does not impart life, but
brings to light that which the Holy
Spirit has already imparted and
teaches that creature what God would
have him do in the Gospel kingdom
of Christ. Now we see that man is
presuming to do what God has not
called him to do.
So on the same principle we hear
our blessed Savior say to Peter in
person, Go and feed My lambs,
My sheep. Not to buy them
with money, for He had purchased
them with His blood; not to quicken
them into life for that was the work
of the Holy Spirit, not to make choice
of, for His Heavenly Father had al
ready chosen them in Himself,
Christ, before the foundation of th'e
world; but just simply do as I have
commanded you to, feed and instruct,
BETTEH THAN SPANKING.
Spanking does not cure children of
bed-wetting. There is a constitutional
cause for this trouble. Mrs. M. Sum

or night.
or teach the Gospel precepts and ex
amples. Anything more than this is
presumption, and we should not pre
sume to be doing a thing that God
has not called us to do. Now I feel
the same rule of quickening into life
in every nation is the same as it is
here, and that by the Spirit of God,
for Christ says He casts out Satan or
regenerates by the Spirit of God.
Paul, in speaking of the saving in
fluence of the Gospel, “For we are
unto God a sweet savor of Christ in
them that are saved and in them that
perish, to the one we are the savor
of death unto death and to the other
the savor of life unto life.” 2 Cor.
2: 15, 16. Now this is what he
means. When the Gospel is preach
ed to the dead in sin *it condemns
him in his sins, for he has no love
for it, because he has not been kill
ed to a love of sin, and, therefore,
he does not feast on it. But to
those that have been regenerated
and have life, when the Gospel has
been preached unto them they hear
because they have an ear to hear,
they understand because they have a
heart to understand, therefore they
are capacitated to believe, and they
grow under the sound of the Gospel.
To him it is a savor of life unto life,
and he is made to rejoice in it, and
it is food to his hungry soul; there
fore we hear Christ say, Blessed is
he that hungereth for he shall be
filled. So we see that character has
already been blessed or he could not
hunger. No dead man hungers for
the natural bread, for he has
not natural life to subsist on that
bread. So we must have spiritual
life to feed on that spiritual food;
for the natural man receives not of
the things of the Spirit, for they are
spiritually discerned.
So that is what our Bible teaches,
and I believe you believe it.
I was talking once to a missionary
minister on the subject of Foreign
Missions in the year that the Phil
lipines were annexed to the United
States. I said to him, You claim that
God uses the Gospel as a means to
regenerate souls? He said, Yes.
Now suppose the Gospel has just
reached the islands, and God is re
generating them with or by the
Gospel; then what has become of all
that died before the Gospel reached
there, if the Gospel was the means
to quicken those? He hung his
head and said they must have been
all lost. Then I said, According to
that theory, it seems as though their
eternal salvation hung on that plan;
they could say in the morning of
the last day that they did not have
the Gospel that they might believe.
That put him to silence. And it is
the end of such a theory.
Now much could be said on this
line. If the Lord’s servants were as
busy working in the sphere that God
has called them and placed them, as
they are trying to do out of it, we
would have a glorious world.
So, Mr. Watson, I feel that the
above is the teachings of the Scrip
tures, and the intention of the Gos
pel.
I hope you will ever be blessed to
expose the unsoundness in the Gov
ernment, and the presuming theory,
and Roman Catholicism, which is
the darkest cloud that is hanging
over and darkening our nation.
Yours very truly,
J. E. SPILLERS.

The above letter explains itself.
Enclosed with it, was a card on which
Rev. Ingram had put down the
amount which he thought it was the
duty of the layman to pay.
What right has he got to think for
another man, on that subject? By
what authority does he deny to his
church members the liberty to think
for themselves?
Os course, he couches his arrogant
encroachment upon his Brother in
the most unctions language. No
harsh commands are issued. But, all
the same, he takes to himself the
right to decide for another man how
much that man should give.
Where is the Scripture for this?
Where will it end, if the people
submit to it?
“Tithing” is unblushingly advo

an integral part of the Old Dispensa
