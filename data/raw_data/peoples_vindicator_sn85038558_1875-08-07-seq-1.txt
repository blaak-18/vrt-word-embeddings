U' To Old Whigs.
e. In a recent speeeh delivered by
iou. II. H. Hill, the following elo
it quent and timely appeal was addres
y sed to those Southern men who are
q, quibbling about the name of Demo
crat, the speaker, himself, being an
of old-line Henry Olay Whig:
I- For twenty years a revolution has
4 been progressing. The struggle of
1. 1876 will finally settle the fate of this
country. The issue is liberty or ea
pire. The Democratic party is the
only party now existing under whose
banner the friends of Constitutional
liberty can rally. In that party again
to be divided I Is that party to
march out fisr the last great battle
with the enemy with squads of froends
firing into its ranks and with selfish
i leaders thinking of nothing but the
at spoils they may gather ? If so, the
- battle is lost and liberty will die the
death that knows no resurrection.
Now let me beg that self may be ab
negated, and the good of the couu.
try only remembered, at least until
the country is safe. Let political
traders and intrigaers forbear to ply
their avocations, and let each one of
us suspect that possibly other men
muay have some patsiotism and win
dow, at least until after the battle is
ra over. For two years at least, let us
le all agree that the best men shall be
chosen for the most imsportant places,
it and that the policy adopted by the
party seiall be assumed to be the
wisest policy.
k No, mn can.., be less partisan than
d myself. No man can have more do
se cided convictions as to what is the
b.-st policy for the party to adopt,
e btat no man will support more cheer
rr fully and earnestly than myself what
a ever may be final authentic decisions
. of the party, whether these decisions
f accord with my previously expressed
opinions or not. For one, I am going
s into the great struggle of 1876 with
no concessions for enemies and no
r ultimatum for friends. I am willing
v to say to the liberalised Demuocracy
of the Union, what Ruth said to
Nahomi, "Where thou goest I will go,
, and thy people shall be my people."
t, ARE You READY ?--We make the
0 following extract from an article on
a des the above head in a late issue of
that stemling little paper, the Lake I
, Charles Echo, and commnend it to the
"dough-faces" and time servers in I
i this eesmmunity :
Just now tne future welfare of the 1
American republic depends entirely '
on the Presidential contest of next
year. Let time epuanllian party win I
that tight; let the army worshipers I
and Constitution haters trimmph in I(
that contest, and the blackness of i
darkness will settle down upon this s
onutry, and brood over it forever,
And in this hour of supreme anx
lety and supreme peril, what are the I
people doing to avert this nationfl I
calamity I You, Mr. A., and you Mr. 1
B., what are you doling Are in word .t
and in deed, identified with the par- 4
ty of the Union and theConstitution ?
Does everybody know that you are a8
Democrat, and that -you would con
sider it an insult to be even suspect, t
ed of favoring the eaceess of the . e-t
publican party ? Do yon encourage t
and uphold the Democratin. press? t
Do you openly favor and immediate <
and thorough orgasization of the iDe
nmocratic party ? Or, lave you a little I
private are to grind, and are youn
looking around for a particular soft
RtepnbHelan grindstpne to gpind it on S 1
Are you just enough Demuoratie not ,
to be called a Republican and just iI
Senough Repuhlican not to be called a s
Denmocrat f If yeo are in this attter t
category of doughdaee, let as tell a
Syon seriously you had better take at
K stand at once, one one side :of the. a
K fence or on the other. The days of
fusion are ended. There ale no birds a
in last year's nest. Eves. the'lRepub- I
licans will flout you if you don't wear a

1 Farm and Household Column,
0 A cotrespondent of the Praetic
Farmer says: "When grass is mow
ed at an eanly period in growth mnetr:
more labor will be required to curt
it thoroughly than if the crop were
'S not cut until the blossoms are begin
sing to fall to the ground. Never
theless, the hay made of early ueat
e grass .will make far better fodder,
and a given quantity, when fed to,
sn tock, will yield mote milk, more
wool, and more flesh, muscle, and
i fat than the same area of gram if al
lowed to beeomne fully ripe before the
i crop is mowed. On the contry,
ripe and dry hay with coarse weeda
e among it, will go ftrthr in.keeplng
e skwk alive than hay made of young
Il and tender grass; bqt the steek thae
kept will depreciate amazingly in
O condition, while supplied with such
inferior fodder. If one has a meed
s ow where there is a large quantity of
coarse grass and only a few feeds, it
e will be far better in every respect to
mow the crop early. In some instaa
e esa, parts of a meadow may be mow
* ed three times during the season. If
one has bog meadows, the oftener th
herbage can be mowed the sooner
i the coarse grass weeds will be oo
out.

water, not hot elnlugl to scald, sun

l ture by keeping it on a stove-hearth
s when it has been risen to top of pitch,
I er, make your sponge in a large ps
