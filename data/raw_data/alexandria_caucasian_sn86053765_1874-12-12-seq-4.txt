VINECAR BITTERS
Dr. J. Walker's California
Yinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the médicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the causo of the unpar
alleled success of Vinegar Bit
ters ?" Our answer is, that they
remove the causo of disease, and
the patieut recovers his health. They
are the great blood purilier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator anil Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of Vin
egar Bitters in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of Dr. Waltc
kr's Vinegar Bitters are Aperient, Dia
phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious, Laxa
tive, Diuretic, Sedative, Counter-irritant,
Ëudorilic, Alterative, and Anti-Bilious.

77EEKLY AND DAILY FOE 1875.
TUE APPROACH of the Presidential
Election gives unusual importance to (lie
events and developments of 1875. We
shall endeavor to describe them fully,
faithfully, and fearlessly.
THE WEEKLY SUN bns now attained
a circulation of over Seventy thousand
copies Its leaders are found in every
State and Territory, and its quality is weil
known to the public. We shall not only
endeavor to keep it fully up to the olll
standard, but to improve and add to its
variety and power.
THE WEEKLY SUN will continue to
be a thorough newspaper. All t he news
ol the (lay will be found in it, condensed
when unimportant, at lull length when of
moment, and always, we trust, treated in
a clear, interesting and instructive manner
It is our aim to make the WEEKLY
SUN the best family newspaper in the
world. It will be full of entertaining and
appropriate reading of every sort, but will
print nothing to offend the most seiupu
loiis and delicate taste. It will always
contain the most interesting stories and
romances of the day, carefully selected
and legibly printed.
The Agricultural Department is a prom
inent feature in the WEEKLY SUN, and
its articles will always bo found fresh and
useful to the farmer.
The number of men independent in pol
ities is increasing, and the WEEKLY SUN
is their paper especially. It belongs to
no party, and obeys no dictation, contend
ing for principle, and for the election of
the best men. It exposes the corruption
that disgraces the country and threatens
the overthrow of republican institutions.
It has no fear of knaves, and seeks no fa
vors from their supporters.
The markets of every kind and the, fash
ions are regularly reported in its columns.
The price of the WEEKLY SUN is one
dollar a year for a sheet of eight pages, and
lifty-six columns. As this barely pays the
expenses of paper and printing, we are
not able to make any discount or allow
any premium to friends who may make
special efforts to extend its circulation.
Under the new law. which requires pay
ment of postage in advance, one dollar a
year, with twenty cents the cost of pre
paid postage added, is the rate of subscrip
tion. ' It is not necessary to get up a clnb
in order to have the WEEKLY SUN at
this rate. Any one who sends one dollar
and twenty cents will get the.paper, post
paid, for a year.
We have no traveling agents.
THE WEEKLY SUN.—Eight pages, fif
ty-six columns. Only §1.20 a year, pontage
prepaid. 2\'o discounts from thin rate.
THE DAILY SUN.—A large four-page
newspaper of twenty eight columns. Dai
ly circulation over J20,0(I0. All the news
for 2 cents. Subscription, postage pre
paid 55 cents a mouth, or $0.50a year. To
clubs of 10 or over, a discount of 20 per
cent. Address,
