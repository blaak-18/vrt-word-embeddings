Members of our Populist parish
committee who were present on
the 6th inst., will smile at the ef.
forts of the Enterprise last week to
misrepresent the meeting.
It says the doors were closed aad
that a considerable number of the
committee bolted the meeting in
the afternoon and left. Let us be
charitable and presume that the
Major refers to the rush that was
made to Mrs. Walmaley's burning
house that day.

Easter Dolttngs.
The beautiful sunshine and the
soft Spring weather, the budding
of flowers and the green that was
spreading everywhere and making
our returning songsters dance with
glee as they filled the air with mu
sic, all conspired to make this one
of the happiest Easters our people
have known for awhile.
**
All our churches held services
on FAster Sunday, and large andi
ences of happy worshipers throng
ed each one of them. But the
Baptist church led off with the
largest congregatibn it has proba
bly ever had. Elder M. E. Weav
er preached an excellent sermon to
the packed house, and every one
seemed interested and delighted.
Miss Maggie Dickerson of near
Winnfield, La., came to our city
Easter Sunday, to spend a few
weeks with her sister, Mrs. II. L.
Brian. We hope her stay will be
pleasant.
*
Mr. E. W. Toddlie of St. Mau
rice, dropped in Sunday evening
and spent the night with us. He
had brought his step-daughter,
Miss Alma Milling, back to the
Normal, after a pleasant Easter
dinner at home.
**
We'll wager our ink-stand that
none of the Easter dinners excell
ed that of our clever and good
hearted door-neighbor, Mrs. J. C.
Keyser, who knows a great deal
more about the management of af
fairs de caisiae than she probably
does about Grecian sculpture or
painting, and is just that much
more useful to humanity. A nice
cover from the well-loaded table
was sent over to ye editor, who on
account of sickness had not been
permitted to eat any thing for 8
days. The choice bits of dainty
cake and the juicy slices from a
well-browned gobler, made us feel
well pro tempore.
At H. Simon & Sons you can

TIEs IuasVb OP TIE IDAY.
In Louisiana there are two issues
awaiting expressions by the peo
ple, and demand their urgent at
tention in the approaching cam
paign for State officials and mem
bers of the General Assembly.
The first of these is "ballot re
form," and the second is a definite
stand on the free coinage of silver
at the ratio of 16 to 1.
The democracy of Illinois has
already started the ball rolling in
favor of the latter, and in order to
eleet aUnited States Sonator who
will favor silver on the basis
ramed, it is necessary for the dem
oray ay Lmouisian to makeit an
issue in the approaching eanvass so
that seators and representatives
in the general assembly may not
be able to dodge the question on
either hallot reform or silver in the
legiaslature on the ground that they
were not issus In the anvass.
It is a well Lknown fact that the
present Governor is a Cleveland
Ito, ad ia opposed toballot reform,
t~ough he tried to straddle the
political mfence by appointing New
ton Bmbahrd who had voted for
silver; but as Newt had boxed the
sg0ur compass between the HuMs
ad the 8ats, his Excelleasy saw

There is one mistake reformers
are apt to make and that is to ap
peal to office-holders to the self
satisfied, to those that fare sump
tuously every day. As well ex
pect a well-fed hog to leave a clo
ver field and willingly live on the
dogfennel that crowds a dusty lane
or the poodle dog to go out at
night hunting rabbits to keep from
starving. From the ranks of the
down-trodden, the crushed, the op
pressed must come the recruits to
the army of reformers. When
Washington waded the creeks of
Virginia carrying messages he was
learning his first lesson in inde
pendence. When Francis Marion
asked a Brithish officer to dine
with him on a sumptuous repast
of roasted sweet potatoes that of
ficer was so impressed that he went
back to his army and told his su
periors that further action was
useless as Great Britain could nev
er conquer such a spirit. When
the spies from the British army
offered to pay the American sol
diers who were on their way to
congress to demand redress for the
wrongs they suffered at home, these
spies were seized and turned over
to the ame officers whose command
they had deserted. These were
the oppressed, the despoiled, the
desperate, and they won. Great
Britain is to be conquered again
and she never will be conquered
until the American people have
felt the teeth of her roaring lion,
that goes about seeking whom he
may devour, sink into their flesh
deeper than it has done.-Non Con.
