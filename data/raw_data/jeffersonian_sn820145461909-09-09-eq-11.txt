OUR POST-CARD CLUB

ing pictures of Daddy Jim, he wants
you to try to get some of the Bible

subscribers this week. You will be
well pleased with them. To any boy
or girl who sends us a postal card,
and promises to try to get us some
subscribers, we will mail one or two

A TEXAS FRIEND.
Papa takes both of the Watson pa
pers, and he likes them. I was 11
years old yesterday. I have made a
list of 261 names of boys and girls
out of the letters you had in the
square. I would as soon have 50
postals as any of the first prizes.—
Gaynell Wilson, Midlothian, Texas.
FOREIGN MISSIONS.
Papa thinks Mr. Watson’s edito
rials are fine, especially on Foreign
Missions. He says that Mr. Watson
is the only man in our country who
had “grit” enough to expose the mis
sion fraud, as it might be termed.
Well, friends, I go to school at old
Gilgal School, in Screven County,
where Mr. Watson is well known, and
he knows lots of people. We have
three teachers, Miss Lottye Enneis,
Miss Hattie Skinner, and Prof. J. C.
Hollingsworth, the latter being prin
cipal. I hope that my list of 87 names
will get one of the prizes mentioned.
—George Dewey Beard, 11 years old,
Dover, Ga.
FROM OLD MIZZOURAH.
Well, I am coming again, but this
time I have a list of names for you.
I wish very much to win the knife.
I must tell you about what papa has
to say. He said that he wouldn’t
give Tom Watson for all the Bryans
that could be put on Nebraska soil.—
Floyd Holmes, 10 years old, Hempie,
Mo.
DOWN IN MISSISSIPPI.
My brother is a subscriber to The
Jeffersonian, and thinks it is the
grandest paper published. He reads
it so that he can win in the debates.
I am a little girl, 12 years old, and
wish to enter the name contest. I
hope I will win a prize, but if I don’t
I won’t cry.—Lillie Read, Ras, Miss.
TEXAS AGAIN.
lam a little boy, 13 years old. I
am sending you my list of names.
Papa takes both your Jeffersonians,
and could not do without them. I
hope to win a prize. I have 167
names.—Clyde Sheehan, R. F. D. 1,
Talbert, Texas.
A LITTLE GEORGIAN.
I am a little girl, 12 years old. I
have blue eyes, light hair and fair
complexion. I live six miles from
town. I saw your name contest in
The Jeffersonian, and think it is a
great contest for children. I have
160'names. Hope I will receive one
of your prizes. Grandpa takes The
Jeffersonian, and he thinks it the
greatest paper in the world. We all
enjoy reading it. —Gladys Smith, R.
F. D. 3, Bartow, Ga.
ANOTHER NEW MEMBER.
I am a little Georgia girl, just 12
years old. I go to school, and love
my teacher. We live in sight of the
school-house and church, too. I en
joy going to preaching on first Sun
days. My papa takes The Jefferson
ian, and I enjoy reading the children’s
page. This is my first attempt.—
Irene Burckhalter, Lexington, Ga.
WELCOME TO THE CLUB.
My papa takes The Jeffersonian
and the magazine. He thinks there
is nothing like them. He carries
them with him when he goes to see
any of his friends, and reads to them
for hours at a time. I enjoy reading
The Deffersonian
all the children’s letters. I think
some of them have such bright an
ticipations of the future. I will tell
all the members of the club what I
hope to be, —a well-educated, fine
and intelligent lady, with willing
hands to help my dear, good mamma
discharge all her household duties,
and above all to be loved and admir
ed by all my acquaintances. I will
tell you all about my pets. I have
two beautiful calves, two nice kittens,
and one of the most precious and
sweetest baby sisters on earth. I wish
you all could see her when she is in
one of her sweetest moods. Her name
is Johnnie He. I am coming again
some time, whether this finds its way
to the waste-basket or not. —Gussie
B. Nichols, 8 years old, Cooper, La.
SOME RIDDLES.
Here I come to bother you again,
but if you print my letter I will not
come again soon. Well, I will de
scribe myself. I have blue eyes,
light complexion, and dark hair.
Guess my age. It is between 11 and
14. My brother is a subscriber to
the Jeffersonians, and I am always
glad when they come. See the
blotches I make; my little sister is
talking, so I can hardly write well. I
will ask some riddles. 1. How is a
stick of candy like a horse? 2. What
is it that is w’hite as milk, but milk
it ain’t; green as grass, and grass it
ain’t; red as blood, and blood it ain’t;
black as tar, and tar it ain’t? The
first one that guesses will receive a
pretty post-card. Hand me my old
linen bonnet and I’ll be off, but not
before I shake hands with Daddy
Jim. —Beatrice Rice, Brittany, La.
(Os course, if we were to put “is
not” in that riddle, instead of
“ain’t,” it would not be considered
as an improvement by the average
youngster, but, allee samee, “ain’t”
is not right.)
DOESN’T LIKE BOYS—YET.
I live about a mile from Juliette,
Ga., and I go to school every day,
and like it fine. My teacher’s name
is Mrs. Smith. lam in the sth grade,
and am 13 years old. I haven’t any
little sisters or brothers. You asked
us what we thought about boys. I
do not like boys, and especially the
ones at school. They are just as
bad as can be, I think. Papa takes
The Jeffersonian, and likes it fine.—
Willie Fay McCord, Juliette, Ga.
(Did you read what we told some
one a little while ago about using
that phrase, “I like it fine”?)
LIKES COUNTRY LIFE.
As I see so many nice letters in
your space, I thought I would write
one, too. I am a girl, 13 years of
age; live in the country, and like
country life fine, but would like city
life better, I think. I go to school
at Hill Academy. My teacher’s name
is Miss Kate Smith, and I like her
fine. We have a good school here.
I am in the fifth grade, and have
eight studies. My mother died when
I was six years old.—Rebecca Cham
bless, Juliette, Ga.
(When you are speaking of the
weather, it is all right to say, “I like
it fine.”)
“PAPA’S BIBLE.”
I have been seeking an opportunity
to write to The Jeffersonian, and,
when I saw the prize offer, decided
I would take the pleasure of writing.
My father takes the magazine, and
uncle takes the paper. We can hard
ly do without it. We call it “Papa’s
Bible.” We live in town in the fall
and winter, and camp out in the
country in the summer. Our school
will start again in September. We
have three teachers. Mr. Singleton
will be our teacher. I will be in the
eighth grade, and am 14 years of
age.—Lois Yarbrough, Springvale,
Ga.
