',e openrag of the present
District court.
first impressed the
with the gravity 6f the
the law required them
nm He explained to them
fuld-u1lly the nature of the
they. had assumed ; that
ehere in the interest of
nt, and the execution
b that high trusts were
inthem, and grave res
l.s attendled their.actions.
S.t.i that in reference to
duties they had no disc on ;
- ,wey.er. unpleasant they fay
d Ieither had to be -per
S:iiy,-in the letter and spirit
stnructions received, or that
ads sworn officers of the law,
to to be, recreant to their trusts,
; to the oath they had taken.
?=:>He remin. ded them that a refusal
to 'perform their duty, when they,or
t:eitr of them, had knowledge of a
-"iolation of the law, was a crime
against which the law itself provided
a severe punishment. He instructed
.:thefm carefully, patiently, and in
ý"anaguage they could not fail to un
 rtand, as to what was required
. --*them in reference to the punish
tn t of crime. He told them to
l sent anybody and everybody who
`"had violated the laws, no matter who
Vhey were.
He told them to investigate the
-i ondition ot public education in the
-~Prish. He said this was a matter
of the gravest importance to all. He
~w:..-glad to say to them that the
-caus.e of the education of the young
:'r gaming ground, and that, under
their present able management, there
ld been a marvelous improvement
i the public schools of the parish.
He spoke with emphasis against
-the practice of selling liquor to mi
;.ors; of selling dangerous weapons
o-t -ainors,. that might be carried
c oncealed, and of the habit of car
rying concealed by the individual
citizen. He-reverted to the dispo
sition of some to disregard the stat
utes W~ihich denounce these actions,
because they deemed them trivial4
- offenses. He told them, with much
feeling, that thee were no trivial i
offenses, that all violations of the
law were serious, and led to serious I
c-onsequences, and that no people
:ould;.prosper, and be safe in the
protection guaranteed to them by t
the government, who countenanced
• th e least infraction against the ma
S-jesty of the law.
He referred to the Sunday law, t
and said that, though it had been r
universally disregarded before the 1
sitting of the last grand jury, since a
then it had "been generally obeyed e
in this parish. There were a few i
exceptions, and he instructed the i
. jury to' present the violators for trial. a
"This law," he said, "must be
obeyed, because it is on the statute
book; that we have nothing to do
S.with its good or bad policy. If it :
i;sbad law, the best way to bring '
ithat fact to the notice of the law- 0
'uaking branch of the government, d
ir to enforce it.".
The charge included many other t:
issible points, and was productive a
JZ'nuch good. c

when he suggests that 'only one answer can
come to the minds of thoughtful men.
º A ROAD LA W.
The legislature of Pennsylvania
are considering a road law that
strikes a solid blow at the evil of
bad roads, notes the Southern Cul
tivator. Under the bill in each
county - the county judge is to ap
point a superintendent to serve for
three years. Each township is to
elect three commissioners for simi
lar terms. All the commissioners
are to. elect three, of their. number,
who, with the county superinten
dent, shall constitute a board of
road directors, which shall -have
general supervision and take neces
sary action in the matter of locating
or vacating roads. A road tax not
exceeding ten mills on the dollar
of county valuation -.is to be levied.
Males taxable with a valuation less
than $zoo shall work one day on
the roads or pay a cash equivalent.
Those who work out taxes must do
so under supervision and diligently,
under penalty of discharge and for
feiture of right to vote. One
fourth of the taxes collected each
year must be set aside to use for the
opening and macadamizing of high
ways. The pay of the county super
intendent is to be fixed by the sa
lary board or judges.
COTTON FA CTOR Y.
A 'notice published in a Pratts
ville, Ga., paper shows that a di
vidend of zo per cent for the past
six months has been declared from
the earnings of the Prattsville Cot
ton Manufacturing company,
This company is capitalized at
$zSo,ooo, and the stock is held by
five persons. The factory has 7,ooo
spindles, all the products of the will
are sent by mule wagons to Mont
gomery, the nearest railroad station,
for shipment.
"We have been unable to ship
more than one bale of good out of
every ten odered of us by dealers
during the past years" said Mr. W.
F. Northington the head of the en
terprise.
Here is a cotton factory, compel
led to transport its products by mule
power over a rough and muddy
country road, a distance of four
teen miles and yet it pays in divi
dends $30,000, and this is paid year
after year.
Right here in Lafayette are all
the necessary conveniences to ope
rate a factory, transportation faci
lities, raw material in abundance,
an unsurpassed climate, in short
every adjunct fo make it a paying
investment. All we need is the ca
pital. It will be forth coming after
a while.
SOME ROOM YET.
If a few of those energetic and
progressive farmers that have built
up the west contemplate striking
out bolkly for pastures new, we cor
dially extend an invitation to come to
Lafayette. There is room for
them. The mildness of the climate
and the fertility of the soil are spe
cial inducements, and there are
many other advantages.
If they have a little money laid I
by they can bring it along and reap
therefrom as substantial benefits as
,.can be' reaped any where on the
face of God's green earth.
Especially is this appeal directed
to those of the Dakotas, where the
cold is so intense that life, for
many months, is a state of absolute
distress.
We have the finest farming land
that can be found on the globe, we
repeat it, and if some of our energe
tic brethren only knew it, they can
make two to four crops with the
same effort that it takes them to
make one.
You can talk all day about ou'r
lands, in words that may appear
exaggerated to the blizzard and
snow stricken people of the north
west, still you will -be with in the
demain of truth in proclaiming the
advantages of soil.
Then, come th Lafayette and be
happy, contented end prosperous.

tistimee kill a. fellow-citizc,
and the testimony of the ex-wife es
tablished his guilt. The woman,
with a sigh of satisfied ambition,
heard him .sentenced to death.
Now comes forward a lawyer and a
quibble, demonstrating that the
divorce was illegal,. and it is set
aside.- According- to the statutes, a
a wife has no right to testify against
her husband. This fact, it is
claimed in effect, must annul the
fatal testimony, supposed to have
come from an ex-wife, and leave
the murderer legally crowned with
innocence. Here is an opportunity
for much thought, and possibly a
few fees.
INCREASING IN VAL UE.
In x889 Mr. F. F. Myles bought
a tract of land containing a frac=i
tion less than one hundred acres,
situated a mile and half from town,
from Mrs. Anna M. Caffrey, paying'
therefor $3,ooo. A few days ago
this land was sold to' the Acadian
Gun and Kennel Club of New Or
leans, for $x5,ooo. It is the pur
pose of the club, we . understand,
to make it a hunting field.
Here is a gain of 400 per cent,
in less than four years, or a little
over zoo per cent per annum. And
what is more this land is worth
every cent of the $r5,ooo paid
for it.
People outside are beginning to
appreciate the value of our lands
and are not slow in investing. They
realize, it would appear, that in a
few years all these lands will be
taken up, when they will be held at
very high prices.
There are yet many hundreds of
acres that can now be bought at
from $25 to $4o an acre, but in the
nature of things they will not re
main at that price long.
So while the tide is at its lowest
ebb is the best time to. anchor in
the harbor of prosperity.
Orbituary.
Died at his residence in St. Martin par
ish, at 9 o'clock, A. M., CAESAR LABBE,
aged 22 years and 6 months.
The Death Angel came down and
and in its wings wrapped the spirit
of a young, but courageous soul; a
soul who fled this world without
ever having deviated from the path
of truth and virtue.
Born of noble parents, his youth
was spent like that of many a creole
youth, "au foyer paternel." Whilst
yet in his teens he embraced the
profession of druggist, to which he
was so devoted that notwithstand
ing his greatly impaired health it
was difficult for him to abandon.
Gradually weakened by the effects
of pulmonic consumption he at last
resolved to abandon work which
seemed so necessary to him, and
devote his time to the care of his
health. However, nothing could
embetter his condition ; gradually
decaying through the effects of the
hiReful disease, he soon reached the
lowest stage ; and often he would
say "Oh, may it not last too long,"
and he faced death as a welcome
visitor, as a redeemer from unre
lenting sufferings.
In his death we lose one of the
most industrious, sober and per
severing youths in our community.
Beloved by all, he knew not what
an enemy was. Reared in the prin
ciples of Christian charity, whilst
yet a boy he practiced those prin
ciples and bestowed favors upon all
who were within his reach; and a
host of friends will long remember
all the heavenly qualities which
once reposed in that cold and
speechless corpse, whose soul clad
in the garments of purity, of devo
tion and of resignation crossed the
Styx and joined its Maker in the re
gions of everlasting peace.and hap
piness. A Friena:

BENJ. E.
Report of the Grand Jury.
To the Honorable the Judge of the xsth Judicial
Disturct.
"The Grand Jurors duly impanneled and
sworn to inquire within and for the parish of
Lafayette into all matters of eriminal nature,
as well as all other matters concerning the
public good, beg leave to report.
As per instructions received from this
court we have carefully examined the parish
jail as to its sanitary condition and found
the same in a comparatively healthy state,
the prisoners are in good health and they
say that they are well provided for and
well treated. On the whole we would say
that the jail of the parish is well kept.
We next made a careful examination of
the sheriff's office, and found the same in a
first class condition. The sheriff, Mr. I. A.
Broussard, exhibited his quietus frem the
pars Atirifetlsses collesd up to
`ate. . vsled ee and re
cordet omfne and ound' the satd kept In
prop otrder, but we, would reco nl nd that
the "P _e Jury wonull makesnecess iry repairs
to the wiadows:of above office which in their
5nt condition.are not rain proof.
-We. would also recommend the Police
Jury to have the cisterns in rear of the
court house repaired. We have been in
formed that the public roads in some of
the wards pe not in good condition, and in
view of this matter we have instructed the
district attorney, to proceed criminally
against those parties who have failed to do
their duties as road overseers. And we
recommend.especially to the Polige Jury to
take immediate steps towards legalizing all
the roads in the parish which are now used
as public roads. We .have learned that in
a number of instances that the roads have
not been donated nor expropriated.
We have called upon the parish treasurer,
Wm. Clegg, aind found in his possession by
-actual count to the credit of this. parish,
three thousand, two hundred and fifty-eight
dollars and forty-eight ceits, which sum is
sufficient to-promptly meet the expenses of
the parish. - We next called upon the presi
dent of the:-School- Board and we obtained
from him the following : number of white
schools in the liarish, 16; colored school, 1;
and the beard lias ordered 2 more, "I white
and one colored,- to be opened immediately.
And we -found to the credit of the school
fund, $364377 cash balance on hand..
And we would inform the people of this
parish that 'the Police Jury has rendered
much valuable assistance to public educa
cation and we-hope that they will ccntinue
to help on the good cause.
We understood; through the -president of
the School Board that a high school will soon
be in operation in the town of Lafayette,
and will be turncd.over to the Parish School
Board.
Before concluding this report we *have
followed ,the. instructions of your Honor's
able and exhaustive charge to the letter, and
left nothing Sndode within the scope of our
investigatlon.
W,-e tender:. heartfelt- thanks- to our able
and efficient ;district attorney for his many
valuable and much, appreciated informations
All of above we respectfully submit.
" A. A. MORGAN, Foreman.
Letter from Mr. Beall.
ST. MARTINVILLE, LA., April -II, 1893.
Editors of Lafayette Gazette:
GEITLEMEN-I feel it my duty to thank
you for your many kind allusions to me in
connection with the mention of my resigna
tion of the position recently held here as
teacher. They are doubly welcome in vir
the of the toAe of 'sincersty-which pervades
them. - Regret the I cannot give a more
substantial acknowledgment; but we do not
always receive even "'thanks" for kindness
bestowed. If you have not already disco
vered this fact in your present avocation,
you will find your best motions misinterpre
ted and your kindest acts unappreciated.
But we should not become discouraged, nor
lose confidence 'in our fellowman, for we
will be judged fairly and correctly by the
just and upright.'
The severing of the relationship of teacher
and pupil is a painful ordeal: it is like the
breaking up of a happy family. The teacher
of to-day is not looked upon as in days gone
by, as a taskmanster and a flogging machine,
but as a guide, companiin and friend. With
this relationship existing between instructor
and pupil, it is to be hoped, in fact presumed,
that the pupil of to-day will be better equip
ped at manhood than' the average father of
the present to assume the responsible posi
tion of parent,- -not like the brute, a mere
propagator of his species.
The people of. St. Martinville, as a com
munity,-have treated me with all the consi
deration I deserve, or would ask; yet we
have here as elsewhere. those who exemp
lify the truth contained in the old aphorism,
"lHe who cannot build a hat may pull down
a temple." If I" should leave here now,
would be able to look back upon my period
of sojourn here as three of the most conten
ted, bnt not the most profitable, years of my
life. Would carry with me many pleasing
reminiscences of my abode here, and among
the most gratifytng of them, would be the
kind words you have spoken in my behalf.
Yours truly, W. H. 3iEALL.
To the Teachers.
