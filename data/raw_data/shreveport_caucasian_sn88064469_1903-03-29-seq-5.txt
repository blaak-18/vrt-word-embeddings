Linens in plain colors are sure to be
worn later on, especially in champagne
and in reseda tones, as well as the
riverside suitings, closely allied to
crash, and hollands and drill. Linen
shot with white and mercerized] cottons
and linens are preparing in large quan
tities for summer and so are the mer
cerized fancy coatings with line checks,
revived from twenty years ago.
Linen canvas in self colors is singu
larly elegant, and piques, plain a:d
fancy, and spotted duck are sumnner
favorites. There are striped suiting:
and fancy cottons having the appear
ance of ribbon threaded through a tri
ple stripe. White and ecru are well
blended, especially in the brilliantes for
blouses and children's frocks, and a
mixture of silk. and linen with tiny lit
tle motifs in relief.
Sheer lawn can be strongly recom
mended for evening blouses in all col
ors, and the embroidered grass lawns
make bretty evening as well as day
gowns. There are some new applique
spots which are quite wonderful-black
on light green and other colors. They
are applied to linens and would be cap
ital for seaside wear.
Irish linen is heavy and durable and
affords a good choice. Printed drills
and twills will be worn and all kinds
of sateens.
The zephyrs are very cheap, but they
are not so much in demand as they
were a few years ago. or the galateas,
though there are some tempting sLep
herds' plaids lightly shaded.
A new. material is the sole delaine,
which looks like wool and silk, but is
really all cotton. Some of the patterns
are like the old English wanl papers
in continuous circles formed of-tiny
flowers tied with ribbon bows and in
closing more flowers. When these a~'e
mercerized, they are extremely attrac
tive.
All kinds of pastoral designs, some
with pretty little rakes and hoes tied
with ribbon, are curious and pretty,
and one pattern looks like bobbinet.
There are full, rich floral designs on all
these, some covering the entire pattern,
some appearing between stripes, tiny
little bunches of violets peeping out be
tween checks.
In June no doubt there wIl be plenty
of grass lawns seen, for this year they
will show silk stripes and white em
broidery between and pretty chine
stripes with silk lines on either side.
Among the most delightful features
of the summer stuffs are all 'the chine
effects introduced into everything and
the pretty bunches of misty flowers
and multicolored !lowers so suggestive
of the happiest days of Watteau and
Boucher.
The new. line canvas displays fancy
qtripings like drawn thread work, with
an interthreading of green silk here

NOME HANDICRAFT IN PRETTY AND
APPROPRIATE LITTLE GIFTS.
Am Amateur Artist's Dainty "Egg
Frame" For a Photograph-The
Easter Rabbits and What May Be
Done With Them.
Many are the gifts that may be
bought at Eastertide, both expensive
and at moderate cost, but one often
feels like bestowing some little offer
ing that expresses the thought of the
giver in persone I handiwork. With
this in mind anj also the significance
of the season, it is not difficult to fash
ion Easter gifts appropriate and beauti

the first illustration is something which

is within the scope of any amateur
artist. It is made of heavy white or
delicately tinted cardboard. cut in egg
shape.
The center is cut across in several
lines, which cross so that the portions
between the cut lines may be rolled
back, as pictured, disclosing the, pho
tograph in the center. A piece of stifl
paper is 3put over the back of the card
board, all the edges except at the top
being pasted, the top one being left
free so that the photograph may be
slipped through it into position. A
piece of cardboard may be glued to the
back of the paper to act as a support.
The front of the frame may be painted
in water colors and the inscription in
liquid gold.
Round about Easter time tiny rab
bits of plaster or china may be pur
chased at trifling cost at any of the
toy or confectiMnery shops. In the sec
ond illustration is shown a pretty and
appropriate use for these little animals.

A Detsert That Always Please·ea
Attractive Macedoine Salad.
Birds' nest pudding is a good old
standby for Easter and has never been
surpassed by a more modern dish in
the delight of the children and in real
charm of appearance. Once the meth
od of preparation is u:dcrstcod it is
much less trouble than thie lengthy
rule would indicate. When completed,
It has the appearance of a gelatin nest
covered with orange peel straws and
flecked with feathery whipped cream,
in which are snugly el:sconced corn
starch eggs of various hues.
First make a lemon jelly and nco:d it
in the shape of a nest. To do this turn
a gra-ite or eartien pie dish up:.,
down in the bottomn of a two' )liiL
granite basin. Turn in t!:e liquid jnily
and let it stiffen.
For the eggs, empty fur f:'iy r:

a part of the mixture brown ,,-ith
chocolate, a part yellow with the yu:ies
of eggs, and some green with spin ,a.h
green or a vegetable preparation whicch
can be bought. Turn the mixtures into
the shells and stand the eggs in a pani
of meal or flour -to keep the open eiind
upward. P'ut them in a cold place.
Cut candied orange peel into straw\,s.
All this work can be done on Saturday.
An hour or two before the pudding is
wanted carefully peel the shells from
the eggs. Turn the jelly on to a round
glass dish and remove the tin with
care. Put the straws around the out
side of the indentation left by the tin.
Fill the hollow with whipped cream
and nestle the eggs in it.
An attractive macedoine saladl may
be made by dicing cold boiled potatoes

with lettuce cut in strips arranged
about the edge of the dish and tiny let

ON THE DAY OF FLOWERS.
Easter Decorations Everywhere-A
Fruit Bouquet.
Easter is the day of the flowers. The
very churches set the fashion. ,Altars,
chancels and aisles, forsaking their
Lenten gloom, become radiant with
lilies and lilacs, with palms, with roses,
genistas, hydrangeas and violets, with
festoons of pink and red carnationS.
Private houses follow suit, accord
ing to the taste and the means of their
SBASKET OF PINK TULIPS.
owners. Even in the humblest homes
there is some small attempt at floral
decoration. The homes of the wealthy
become visions of tropic exuberance.
In the,cities the very streets'bourgeon
with flowers. ,The scent of blossoms is
in the air. Every woman, carries a
corsage bouquet. Every man who
wishes to be well dressed has a nose
gay in his buttonhole.
While the lily is the typical Easter
flower, the azalea in glowing pink or
satin white is hardly less favored, and
hydrangeas in pink, white or blue, the
yellow geuista, pinks. violets, tulips,
jonquils, hyacinths and lilies of the
valley all lend their aid to the gracious
beauty of the day.
For the tVble, one of the chief deco
rative points in the home, a pretty ar
rangement is shown in the quaint shap
ed basket filled simply with pink tulips.
There are. however, numbers of flowers
of the bulb family that are useful to
take the place of tulips' for this pur
pose. A pale green ribbon is gracefully
tied to the basket. These and similar
baskets of flowers make extremely ac
ceptable presents.
A novel and altogether charming
style of decoration, originally, planned
for a dinner party in a private house,
utilizes the favorite Easter colors.
green and white, and could hardly be
improved upon for this occasion. All
down the center of the table silvered
white tulle is placed over scrolls of
pale green ribbon, and upoq the tulle
are scattered single heads of violets land
tiny fronds of fern. On the outer edge
are sprays of the same flower, and out
side these two stoles of smilax are
placed, the ends of which hang down
.at either end of the table.
A pretty novelty for this season,
which has come from abroad, is a "fruit
bouquet"-that is to gay, a bouquet
lightly made of branches of the minia
ture orange tree with the fruit on them.
The same design may. of course, be
carried out in the tiny pomegranates
which can occasionally be bought and
also in branches of plum or damson
with the little blue plums on them.
Asparagus fern, or choice foliage, is
judieiously introduced into these bon
quets.

the devotees of fashion, and the somber
robes are put away and apparel of rain
bow tint donned for spring.
Among the things prepared for this
joyous event is an Easter confection,
here represented, for which its design
er claims that it shows a little, at least,
what the costume of the immediate
future is likely to be. The'bodice is
not much pouched, the front being bor
dered with galloon. which is carried
round the well shaped and uncommon
cape. It is made of the new coarse
canvas of a silver gray hue. Both
skirt and bodice are plaitedi. these
plaits being held down by insertions
with braid. At the foot the fullness is
allowed to flow. The sleeves are of the
bishop order.' Over this can be worn
one of the new smart little cape wraps
which are lined with silk. The cape is
so shaped that it has much the appear
ance of a sack coat, fitting the shoul
ders well and then falling freely. simu
lating tWe .lapanese kimono in the
sleeve. This is altogether an ideal cos
tume.
Of the smart violet hats shown in the
second cut one is 'a close fitting, be
coming affair in burnt straw with an
edging of black straw round the brim
and trimming of violets, foliage and
cream lace. The second is a new shape
in black chip. with an upturned curved
brim, the edge of which is white chip.
Buttonhole bunches of violets and foli
age compose the trimming.
Biscuit color and champagne tones
are to have a great following, and long
stole ends will fall from many of the
capelike pelerines that are to be worn.
