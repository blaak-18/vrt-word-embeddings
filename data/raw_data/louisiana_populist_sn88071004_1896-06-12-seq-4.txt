The sooner you get rid of the notion
that you are smart, the better you will
be off. There never was a man who
had good sense, to say nothing of being

Walsng refr Trial
[rg In jail at Juneau, waiting trial on
ok the charge of murder, is Chief Ye
We Teetlech, the tyee of the Hoona In
lad diana, a small tribe of some 100 mem
bers, occupying Chicakikoff island,
about 100 miles southerly from Junea.
The offense with which the old chief
rill is charged is the murder by torture of
ho his nephew, whom heaooused of witoh
craft. 1The chief had a disease affect
ing his right leg, which had gradually
eaten the great part away. He dreamed
that his nephew had bewitched him,
the and on the strength of this heproceed
lan ed to inflict punishment due the crime.
on The victim's knees were bent close
back, and in this position he wasbound
fep tightly to a tree. An iron band, a
est quarter of an inch thick, was then
placed around his face, sinking into
the nose and covering the eyes, and
this was also made fast to the trees, so
that he was unable to move his head
any direction. lie was left in this po
sition to starve to death. Tne lived
five days. le was 20 years of age.
Uses of Poverty.
,'Sweet are the uses of adversity,"
but it takes a philosopher to appreciate
the fact that poverty is his best friend.
We all admit that it is necessity that
drives mankind to its best work, but
it is a blessing we want bestowed on
some one else. In a recent magazine
article, Andrew Carnegie says: "We
tL should be quite willing to abolish
- luxury; but to abolish poverty would
I' be to destroy the only soil upon which
mankind can depend to pro'luce the
virtues which alone can enable the
N race to reach a still higher civiliza
tion than it now possesses." Notwith
standing this true view of the case,
there is a general desire to do away
with poverty. Indeed, it is to
the individual effort to abolish poverty
that the world owes the elevation of
the race. Most of us agree with the
sage who said that it may not be a
disgrace to be poor, but it is exceed.
of ingly inconvenient.
Clear Cut.
Imitation cut glass is made so much
A> like the real now that it takes an ex
pert to tell the difference. Of course,
- every woman claims she is a coanois
k. sour who can tel the genuine from the
false across the block, but as a matter
- of fact it is very difficu. One woman
will test it by trying the edges to see
if it is eharsp. Another will thump
it to see if it gives out a clear, reson
Sar sound. Dealers jp fancy glass tell
- t by the color. The edges of real cut
ý glass show a green color. This ver
Is dant hue is frequently reflected in the
purchaser, who doesn't know whlt
she is getting. One infallible way to
tell the genuine is by the puce.
if There's never any mistaking the price,
r- or the hollow ring one's purse gives
. out after purchasing it. The cuts in
o. cut glass never extend to the price.
Foe Did Not Always Have a Clean Skihrt.

Ir It is a Ittle shocking to think of

N petuating a bard's fame. There isn't
mudh of the poetry 'written oowadays
that would wash. Poe's poetry was

He liads Diamonds sad Money at Very
Rare Intervals.
before commencing operations each
man in a gang provides himrolf with a
bull's-eye lantern, a canvas apron and
a pole some seven or eight feet in
length, having an iron attachment at
one end, somewhat in the shape of a
hoe, says Pearson's Weekly. For
greater convenience the lantern is in
variably fixed to the right shoulder, so
that when walking the light is thrown
ahead, and when stopping its rays
shine directly to their feet. Thus ac
coutred, they walk slowly along
through the mud, feeling with their
naked feet for anything unusual, at
the same time raking the accumulation
from the walls and picking from the
crevices any article they see. Nothing
is allowed to escape them, no matter
what its worth, provided it is not ab
solutely valueless. Old iron, pieces of
rope, bones, current coin of the realm
and articles of plate and jewelry-all
is good fish which comes to the hunt
er's net. With "fins" in the way of
coins, of course, the "humble penny"
predominates. Sixpences and shillings,
however, often increase the value of
their collection and at rare intervals
too rare to plisse the hunter-half
sovereigns are discovered. Like the
flies in amber, the mystery is how they
got there.
Among other articles of intrinsic
worth silver spoons are most often
found, aJthcugh shirt studs, diamond
rings, silver drinking vessels and many
other quits out of place articles swell
the list from time to time. Lucky finds,
sueh as those above mentioned, do not
deter the sewer man from keeping a,
keen lookout for less valuable articles
as they loat by. His sharp eye, from
long practice, is capable of judging the
worth of the floating refuse before it
would te even discernible to the or
dinary observer. Mile after mile does
the sever ~tunter traverse underground,
until a. tolerably heavy bag is a result
of his :abor. Night and day is all one
to the man. Some gangs enter the
sewer at night and work on until
morning, while others carry out the
search only during the daytime. Rats
abound everywhere, some of them be
ing of enormous size, large enough to
frighten any beginner at the game. The
experienced hunter, however, takes no
notice of them and the rats are only
too pleased to sneak away in the dark
ness.
Regan Alike, but Ended Dlfferently.
The tragedy of the sea that has just
occurred between Singapore and the
Carolines seems to surpass in horror
the famous butchery of the "Flowery
Land." The Maria II. had an Eng
lish captain and a Chinese crew, and the
crew mutinied under the leadership of
the boatswain. They murdered the
captain, the mate and a negro pas
senger, tied the bodies of the two
oficers to an anchor and threw it over
board, and then made prisoners of the
captain's wife and child. Next they
fought among themselves, like the mu
tineers of the Bounty, and three more
were sent after the captain and the
mate. The survivors steamed a course
to the Pelew islands, hoping, no doubt,
to find a new Pitcalrn. But they were
overhauled by a Spanish cruiser on the
way and taken to Manila, where they
now lie in jail. What would have hap
pened but for that Spanish cruiser?
The Bounty men went at it with drink
and the knife, until these and other
mischances thinned their numbers
down to one. He turned pious and
founded the most pet'fect Christian
community on all the broad earth. To
this day it flourishes in primitive pur
ity of faith, morals and manners, on a
speck of rock, and few crews that pass
that way can resist the temptation to
lad and say their prayers.-London
