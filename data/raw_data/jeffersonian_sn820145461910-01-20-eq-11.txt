Read These From" Farmers’ Union Boys:
(Concluded from Page 3) - k j. .
lessly cast years of sacrifice and la
bor to naught.
The promoters of the secession
movement, should they be ever so sin
cere and honest, can only accom
plish a rend in the Union, that can
never be healed, and will only in
vite dismembership and ultimate
disaster to the organization.
Think of the time that will be
wasted, and the bitterness that will
be engendered, to say nothing of the
great loss in membership, and the
advertisement that will go out that
we are divided and fighting among
ourselves.
The public is already apprised
that our forces have been weakened
by the tremendous loss of member
ship in the last few years, and do
you think that anything can be
gained, in the confidence of the
large majority of farmers, by this
fruitless effort at division in our
ranks?
Therefore, in consideration of
these facts above stated, and for the
purpose of checking their reckless
destruction of our Farmers’ Educa
tional and Co-operative Union of
Texas, and to preserve the splendid
unity, the result of so much time,
money and sacrifice, we, the under
signed members of the Farmers’
Educational and Co-operative Union
of America, appeal to the thousands
of loyal and patriotic men and wo
men —the old guard—to call a halt
in this attempted wholesale destruc
tion of our order, by refusing to
send in any more charters to have
them cancelled and to recall those
already sent in, and boldly instruct
your State officials to get back in
line, and take up the real w’ork of
the old F. E. and C. U. of A., which
was grandly marching forward to
its speedy consummation.
We call upon Brother Peter Rad
ford, the Vice-president of the State
Union of Texas, to assume his prop
er functions, in case the State Presi
dent, W. T. Laudermilk, will not re
verse his determination to lead the
secession movement, to step to the
front of the old F. E. and C. U. of
A. in Texas, and lead the old guard
back under the peaceful and beloved
banner of our beloved order. To
this end, and for the restoration of
unity and peace, we hereby call a
conference of the old guard—the
loyal rank and file of the F. E. and
C. U. of A., to meet in the city of
Waco, Texas, on the 28th day of
January, 1910, for the purpose of
putting in force a plan to save our
great organization from division and
endless strife, and again uniting the
movement, and educating the rank
and file to the fatal result of seces
sion.
Reduced railroad rates will be se
cured for all members who attend
this conference.
Yours for peace and unity,

Is’There Graft in the Union ?
D. J. Neil, editor of the Co-oper
ator, has come out 'brazenly and ask
ed the hard-working farmers of
America to make up “several hun
dred dollars” to pay for him a free
trip to Washington.
What does this look like to you,
brethren?
Let us look into this gigantic
“free-will offering” /or charitable
collection move. Wi
In the first place Neil says his
paper “circulates in thirty-five
States,” and in the beginning of his
article he says: “I shall go to
Washington as a delegate from the
Texas State Union.” He says fur
ther: “The Co-operator has many
subscribers who are in arrears and
will soon be delinquent. We would
ask all those to renew now, and at
the same time, all who can, to send a
contribution toward the fund neces
sary to pay for my trip to Washing
ton.”
What do you think of that?
Further on he says: “My friends
have always stood by me, and now,
in this culminating moment, I know
I shall have their support.”
.How does that sound to you,
brother farmer?
In the first place, the great Neil
is calling on the farmers of “thirty
five States” to contribute toward the
expenses of a “delegate from Texas.”
It is very important that Texas
have a “delegate” to Washington, so
we farmers from Arkansas and the
other thirty-four States should hur
ry up and send in some coin.
What about it, brethren; shall we
send the coin?
Now, the above is the apparent
conditions if Neil is honest in his re
quests, but instead of it being the
State of Texas calling on the entire
country to help pay the expenses of
the Texas delegate, it is an individ
ual in the person of D. J. Neil.
Funny, isn’t it, brethren?
We do not believe the farmers of
the great State of Texas approve of
any such wholesale beggary. We
are a native of that State, and re
sent any such insinuations as being
slanders on a great and splendid
people. We further believe that if
the Farmers’ Union of Texas have
elected Mr. Neil as their delegate to
Washington, they are amply able and
more than willing to pay his ex
penses, and would not permit him
to cheapen their grand organization
by taking up a collection in any such
manner.
Let us do a little figuring. Mr.
Neil says in his w r onderful announce
ment that he must have “several
hundred dollars” for expenses. Last
August we talked to a man who was
in Little Rock at the time of the
State meeting of the Union, a man
who claimed to be and undoubtedly
was the editor of the Co-operator.
Among other interesting things, he
told us that they had between forty
and fifty thousand subscribers. It is
these thousands of readers and
friends that Mr. Neil is soliciting to
help him raise “several hundred dol
lars.” Os course they will not all by
any means contribute, but many
“faithful friends” will send him a
dollar each, and some of his espe
cially good friends will probably
send him $5 and $lO each. But sup
pose the average for the entire sub
scription list did not go over the
small sum of 25 cents each; that
would net something like $12,500.
To be still more conservative, the
average may not exceed the insignifi
cant sum of 10 cents; that would
give the brother about $5,000 for his
little advt. and his friends’ good will
toward him. If the average did not
exceed the measly sum of a nickel, it
would yield the neat sum of $2,500,
which is a nice little profit on the
side.
And now, my dear brethren,
wouldn’t that “jar” your corn crib?
Mr. D. J. Neil is ex-president of
the Texas State Union, and one of
the most talked of men in the Union.
We do not know much about Mr.
Neil outside of what his own paper
says about him. We shall, however,
give the few incidents that have
come under our personal observa
tion. A few weeks ago there ap
peared in the columns of the Co
operator (Neil’s paper) the state
ment that he (President Neil) was
dearly loved by every man, woman
and child in the great State of Texas.
The wording may be a little differ
ent. This is a fine compliment, and
may be true, but we think it would
sound better coming from some
other source.
In the edition of his paper for De
cember 15th, he announced that the
Co-operator is the official organ of
the Farmers’ Union of Arkansas.
That is an unqualified falsehood,
<3!je Jeffersonian
and Mr. Neil knows it. The truth of
the matter is, the Co-operator has no
more official connection with the
Farmers’ Union of this State than
the New York World. We have at
tended two State meetings, and can
prove by two hundred delegates that
the Co-operator was never discussed
as an organ, nor was there ever a
proposition to make it such. More
than that, the then editor of the Co
operator was in Little Rock last Au
gust and could not even attend the
convention because
HE WAS NOT A MEMBER OF
THE FARMERS’ UNION.
This he told us himself, and had
cards and papers showing that he
was all he claimed.
It is true, the Co-operator took
over the name and certain contracts
of the Union Tribune, but the Trib
une did not, and could not, sell an
official capacity vested in it by 85,000
people, even if it had had such. But,
on the other hand, the Tribune was
not, never was, and never claimed to
be the official organ of the Farmers’
Union of Arkansas.
Many times the founder of the pa
per, Brother Ben. L. Griffin, has told
his readers through the columns of
his paper why it was not, and could
not be, the official organ of the Un
ion. That reason was, and is, because
an official organ, according to law,
must be owned by the institution or
association of which it is the organ.
According to the official heading of
the Co-operator, it is not even the
official organ of the Texas Union, but
a commercial enterprise owned by a
corporation. It is only endorsed by
the Texas Union as a medium of
publication, the same as was this pa
per endorsed by the State Union of
Arkansas in session in Little Rock
last August.
If we understand the matter, and
we think we do, “The Co-operator
Publishing Company” is a corpora
tion composed of those “higher-up”
of the State of Texas, and we fur
ther understand that they are capi
talized with the small but neat little
amount of $50,000. The conclusion
to this point, then, is that these clev
er, well-to-do gentlemen, of which
Mr. Neil is the “Editor-in-chief,” are
resorting to falsehood and deceit to
get business from Arkansas.
One more point: There have re
cently appeared in the columns of a
well-known, reputable and thorough
ly responsible publication, serious
charges in which are mentioned the
names of certain well-known and
high officials in the Farmers’ Union.
Among these names that of D. J.
Neil, of Fort Worth, Texas. About
the only reply Neil has made to
these articles, is to deny them and
deal in unmanly personalities to
ward the editor of the publication,
whom he calls a “Great Scold” and
other equally unworthy epithets. It
matters not what our personal views
or political convictions may be in
answering an argument, we must
meet argument with argument and
fact with fact. To answer by un
proven denials and personal mud
slinging is, to our mind, sufficient
proof of guilt. The Jeffersonian is
a publication responsible for what
it publishes, and Mr. Watson is a
man whose integrity has never been
questioned. When charges come
from such a source, they demand
consideration, and a great fair
minded public will consider them.
If these men are innocent, let them
force Tom Watson to retract with
the majesty of the law. If they do
not do this, nor even attempt it they
must accept at the hands of the peo
ple a verdict of guilt.
There is no denying the fact that to
day the Farmers’ Union is facing the
crisis of its existence. The whole
trouble has grown out of one cause,
and that cause is a lack of confidence
in the high officials of the order.
Several things / have occurred of late
to produce and foster this lack of
confidence among them, and, princi
pally, the amendments to the Na
tional Constitution. By reports sent
out from headquarters it is announc
ed that they were carried by an
overwhelming majority. While we
do not wish to doubt these reports,
we must say that we have not heard
anything but bitter condemnation in
our travels over Arkansas. We do
know that there are hundreds of
good Union men who do not believe
these amendments carried, but that
fraud was practiced by some of the
officials. It is our opinion that un
der these circumstances a full and
complete report should be made,
showing just how each Local voted,
with the address of the secretary, in
order that any one desiring to do so
can verify the truth of the report. A
copy of this report should be placed
in the hands of every local secretary.
We believe the individual members
of the Union have a right to know
the details of every transaction made
by their officials. It may be argued
that the cost of such a report would
be too great, but we reply that the
cost will not be one-hundredth part
of the benefit. The benefit will be
either one of two results:
First. If the report is true, it will
be proven so, and the confidence of
the members restored.
Second. If there has been fraud,
the fraud will be uncovered, and the
Union can act accordingly with its
traitors.
We recommend that every Local in
Arkansas have a meeting at once,
admitting all who were in good
standing before any of these new
measures were put into effect and
carefully discuss this question. If
you see fit, pass a resolution that
the report be made and send it to
the Executive Committee, also send
a copy of the resolutions to this pa
per for publication.
Let no man quit the Union be
cause he thinks some of the officials
are corrupt, but put his shoulder to
the wheel and help stamp out the
corruption. If any Local, or any
member, thinks any official is not
what he should be, let a resolution
be passed, demanding an investiga
tion. We will maintain the integri
ty of the Union at all costs, and de
stroy the aggressor.—Union Educa
