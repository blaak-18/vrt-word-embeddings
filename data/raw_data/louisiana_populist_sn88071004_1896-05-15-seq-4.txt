Almost every year the seps ed the
weather bureau is nlarged so s to
make it of more practical benet. The'
government does its best to give the'
country good weather, and if, in spite
of it, droughts and floods will some
times occur, it is not to be blamed. An
improvement to this important servies
is to be inaugurated the 1st of July,
and consist in stamping the latest
weather forecasts on each letter in ad
dition to the regular postmark. It will
be seen at a glance what a great beone
tit and convenience this will be.
Heretofore, when one received an in
vitation to in outing, one was in doubt
whether to accept or not, on account
of the uncertainty about the weather.
Now one will simply look at the envel
ope and see that the stamp says it will
be fine. or rainy, to-morrow, and the
and the question will be settled at
once. People who are much affected
by the weather will expect the post
man to tell them how they feel. They
will look to find their love letters
marked ",Clear, with rising barome
ter," and their overdue bills stamped
"Cloudy, with great depression over a
wide area."
All for a Seent.
People brought up on bottles may
know that a man in New York who
was agent of a certain brand of Eng
lish ale for many years, and whose
bottling was preferred to that of the
brewers, came near ruining his busi
ness on one occasion by getting hold
of a lot of bottles from a tenement dis
trict. Most of the housewives in the
cheaper neighborhoods of the city use
bottles as a substitute for cans wher
they get in a supply of kerosene, and
it is well known that it is a practical
impossibility to remove from a bottle
the odor of the oil. McMullen bought
a supply of these bottles and filled
them with ale, and in course of time
they reached his customers. The
consequence may be imagined. They
nearly ruined him. You may scrub
and you may boil the bottle as you
will, but the qoent of the oil will hang
round them still.
How well shiftless people get along
appearantly.

BOOTH IN HIDING,.
Ste Mls Lite Hung by a Very slander
Thrend.
i The spot to which Captain Cox led
the assassins was an old tobacco-bed
" covered with broom-sedge in a dense
I thicket of young pines, which was not
near any roadway.
Thomas A. Jones, a foster-brother of
Captain Cox, and who had been his
overseer, lived within half a mile of
the Potomac, on a place called "Huckle
berry"; and as he had been regularly
engaged in conveying spies and block
ade-runners surreptitiously across the
Potomac, Cox sent for him and placed
Booth and Herold in his charge. Jones
daLly brought food covered with corn
in a basket to the fugitives and called
lustily to his hogs as he paid his visits.
Each day he found Booth suffering
much from his leg, and usually on the
ground, rolled in his blanket. He was
eager for the papers giving an account
of the murder, and seemed to be much
distressed that his foul deed met with
little approbation in the South. Jones i
watched his opportunity to take his
dangerous charge to the river, about
two and a half miles distant; and nearly
a week-a gloomy, cloudy week of chilly
mist-passed before the-favorable op
portunity came.
On the third or fourth day after
Booth reached the pines it was decided
to dispose of their horses, which had
become restless from lack of food and
proper stabng, as it was feared that
their neighifg would betray them. Ac
cordingly, Herold and Franklin A. 1
Roby, Capt. Cox's overseer at that
time, led the horses about two miles
distant into Zekiah swamp, where it
makes a junction with Clarke's Run,
and here they were shot. As the place
was boggy, the bodies of the dead
horses disappeared from view in the
course of a week, and were never seen
afterward.
The carcasses of these animals, how
ever, came near betraying Captain Cox.
A large troop of colored cavalrymen
cae to his residence for the purpose
of seeuring information as to the route
taken by the assassins after they leIt
Rich Hill. Captain Cox showed them 1
the general direction of their course
early Sunday morning, which was
toward Zekiah Swamp. The troopers
started for the swamp, and Captain 1
Cox and his son retired to a knoll about
me fourth of a mile ia the rear of his I
house, which commanded an extensive
view of the entrance to the swamp in
the valley below. They could easily see
the bussards hovering over the spot
where the horses had been killed a few
days before, their bodies not having
yet sank in the bog. Captain Cox and
his sen aamously watched the cavalry
.es approach the swamp. Would they
or would they not enter below the dead
horses? Captain Cox nervously ques
tioned. "My mes," said be, "if those
meer enter below the spot where the
bodies of the horses are, I shall hang
for it."
The colored cavalry entered but a 4
short distanes above where the horses
lay, and deployaing at inatervals of fifty
ifet, best the swamp from Captain
Cox's to Dr. Mudd's, nearly ifteen
miles.

Paralysis Follows MIeclussness

A PATIENT WOMAN AFFPPLICTED

From the Press, New York City.
For more than Sdteen years, Mrs. A.
Mather, who lives at No. 4 East Onehmn
dred-and-twelfth Street, New York, was a
sufferer from anmmia, which, in spite of
the treatment of physiclans, gradually de
venoped into nervous prostration uatil
fnally marked symptoms of paralysis set
in. Mrs. Mather gladly gave the reporter
her experience.
"For many years," Mrs. Mather said, "I
was a constant suaerer from gervousnea.
It was about fifteen years ago that my con
dition began to grow worse Soon I be
came so affected that I was prostrated and,
until about two years ago, was a part of
the time unable to leave my bed. I am
ployed several physicians from time to
time, my bills at the drug store for pre
scriptious, sometimes, amounting to as
much as 150 a month, but all the doctors
did for me did not seem to help me at all.
My blood becamegreatly impoverished anad
after years of suffering I was threatened
with paralyslis.
"When I walked I could scarcely drag
my feet along and at times my knees would
ive away to that I wouldalmost fall down.
Feeling that doctors could not help me I
had little hope of recovery, until one day I
read in a newspaper how a person, aflicted
almost the same as I was, had been ored
by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale Peo
pie. I purchased a box and began tk
the pills. The effeot of thisfirstbox
me so much that I bought another.
I had taken all the pills in the first ;o
began to experience relief ad, after the
third box had been used, I was potically
cured. It was really urprli what a
speedy and pronounced effect the medicine
had upon me.
"I always keep Dr. Williams' Pink Pills
in the house now, and whes I feel any
symptoms of nervousness find tat they
give me certain relief."
Mrs. Mather's daughter, Miss Anna, eor
roborated her mother's secount, and told
how she herself had beep cured of chronic
indigestion by these pills; sad how, too,
her cousin had been cured of nmmma
