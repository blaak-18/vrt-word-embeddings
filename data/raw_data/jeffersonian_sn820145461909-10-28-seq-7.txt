real understanding between Taft
and our beloved Papa at Rome, and
about the secret bargain between
Taft and Wall Street, this country
would be rocking with revolution —as
Spain is.
Presumptively, all successful poli
ticians in this country nowadays are
two-faced rascals. Don’t give me
away on this. T. E. W.
A COCA-COLA VICTIM.
Dear Sir:—Having kept up for
some time with the dispute over the
presence of “dope” in Coca-Cola, I
beg to submit this evidence:
Two years ago when I entered the
University of Arkansas, I had never
seen any Coca-Cola, but I began to
associate with a boy who was an in
veterate user of it in all seasons. He
said that he had often tried to quit
but could not, and often he was
forced to leave his study-room and
go to a cold-drink stand to satisfy his
craving for Coca-Cola. He induced
me to try a glass, and the result was
a violent headache that lasted for
several hours. On one other oc
casion I drank a glass, and with the
same result. Today that boy is a
helpless victim to the “dope” habit.
I am unable to understand why so
many religious papers are taking up
the cause of this “dope” and pub
lishing either forged or false chem
ists’ reports on the purity of Coca-
Cola. Very sincerely,
GUY WOLF.
IMPORTANT NOTICE.
In view of the fact that the Young
Men’s National Populist League and
the Jeffersonian Clubs are working
for the same principles, and since or
ganizations are in harmony with
each other, it seems but natural that
the Young Men’s League should be
known as the Junior Jeffersonian
Club; therefore from this on it will
be known as same.
The age limit from this time on
will be changed from sixteen to twen
ty-one years, and will read from six
teen to twenty-five years.
Yours truly,
WILL H. STANFORD.

THE DEACON WAS WRONG.
Dear Sir:—Yesterday I heard it
asserted by a deacon of our Baptist
Church here that you had acknowl
edged that you have made a mistake
about “Foreign Missions”, and that
you now approve of the present plan.
I contradicted it. Will you please
tell us in your next week’s Jeffer
sonian which was correct, the dea
con or I? Sincerely,
J. G. WRIGHT.

Answer.
Show the Deacon any number of
The Jeffersonian, and perhaps he will
admit his error. I have not only not
changed, but am more convinced
than ever that these fanatics (some
of whom are grafters) are doing re
ligion a vast deal of injury.

PEOPLE ARE WAKING UP.
I am seventy-one years old, have
been reading reform papers for thir
ty-four years and like the two Jef
fersonians better than any other re
form literature I have ever read, for
the bold and fearless stand they take
on any and every subject of interest
to the common people, both political
and religious.
The articles on foreign missions
are eye-openers to millions of duped
people and ear-stingers to hypocrit
ical preachers, and you are going to
reap your reward as sure as there is
a God in heaven. The common peo
ple are beginning to see and under
stand; their eyes are now open, and
like the darkey’s pups—they are no
longer Campbellite pups but Baptist
pups.
People of different political and re
ligious faith will sit for hours and
listen to me read your articles on
missions, and sometimes the aged
and wrinkled faces are bathed in
tears. I assure you, you don’t real
ize fully the good you are'doing.
The seed you are sowing in the
hearts of the people are springing up
and are going to produce a bountiful
harvest, rich and ripe.
God help you is the prayer of your
unworthy servant,
R. T. SHORT.

Dear Sir:—l want to congratulate
you on the fine work you are doing
on the two Jeffersonians, especially
the Magazine, which I regard as the
ablest publication in the United
States dealing with economic prob
lems. Sincerely yours,
J. R. TAYLOR.

NOT AFRAID OF WHAT PEOPLE
SAY.
Dear Sir: —I have read your lit
erature since September, 1908, and
find it pure and clean. And will say
that I indorse your articles on For
eign Missions and Socialism. I have
just read a long piece in the National
Rip Saw on Socialism and consider
it a double-faced thing, but one could
not expect anything better from an
editor who has said that he could
have taken mud and made a better
man than the Almighty did of old
Adam. I think such men are to be
pitied.
I am a full-blooded Baptist by
faith, and try to be in practice, but I
am not afraid to tell my belief about
missions to any man or any set of
men or Christians. I believe a lot of
good things have been withheld by
people remaining silent through fear.
A man is doing himself and his coun
try an injustice by not speaking out
for whatever he believes to be right
—even as I am trying to do in my
weak way.
Very truly yours,
GEORGE A. VAUGHAN.

REDEEM THE UNIVERSITY OF
VIRGINIA.
Dear Sir: —Since reading what
Mr. Showalter has to say about the
fame of Jefferson and the University
of Virginia, together with “Editor’s
Note”, it strikes me that there is a
field for a tangible and specific work
under the lead of the Jeffersonian
Clubs—the redemption of the Uni
versity of Virginia to original ideas
and teachings of Jefferson in every
particular in which Jefferson’s views
can be clearly discerned. While not
quite so broad as the general welfare
purpose of the Jeffersonian Clubs as
inaugurated, it will seem more tan
gible and more specific than at pres
ent, and yet will be of almost as
Dlje Jeffersonian
broad consequences. The point I wish
to make is that the tangibleness and
specificness of that would be attrac
tive and incentive and would pro
voke enthusiasm in many important
instances where the conception of the
importance of the general welfare
purpose of the clubs as organized
would not be of sufficient clearness
and force to be stimulus enough to
bring them into action, thus bringing
two great elements together to work
for about the same final yet from
different sources, thus not detracting
an iota from the present prospect and
purpose of the Jeffersonian Clubs,
but adding many other stars to the
crown it is our desire to enthrone.
I would suggest that we have en
graved charters for each local club,
Jefferson’s likeness in the center, with
Jefferson’s old house on the one side
and the University of Virginia on the
other, followed by Jefferson’s views
set forth on all great or important
questions; have each member view
the charter, read Jefferson’s findings
and sign attached oath to upnold
Jeffersonianism, regardless of party
ism, etc. And add fifty cents per
annum per member, this to go to the
redemption and maintenance fund of
tne University of Virginia, having at
all times at least five of the oldest
aiumni oi the University on the board
of directors, say, have nine directors,
no president.
Can’t you get a co-operative move
ment among the old students and
others to that effect? I think so.
Inclosed please find money order
for two dollars for the following sub
scriptions: Col. S. S. Bennett,
monthly one year; W. R. Knight,
weekly one year. Believe both are
renewals. You might send them cop
ies of “Foreign Missions” as pre
miums.

“SUCCESS TO YOU.”
Gentlemen:—You will please find
enclosed two dollars, for which send
to my address at Madison, Fla., the
Jeffersonian. My son, Thos. Z. Mar
tin, clerk of the circuit court, would
like for his subscription to your mag
azine to commence with the August
number.
I like the paper and I think that
you are doing a great work, and
your paper is and will be a great ed
ucator, politically and religiously, if
it can get before the people, and I
am going to help you get it before
the people.
Success to you.
Yours truly,
JAMES P. MARTIN, Judge.

SCHOOLEY’S SEED WHEAT.
Although not exhibited by the
Schooley Company, the varieties of
seed wheat sold by them took the
highest premiums at the great fair at
Hagerstown, Maryland. If you are
going to plant wheat this year, write
at once to the Schooley Co., Hagers
town, Md. They have been in busi
ness for half a century, and they can
give you both good advice and good
wheat.
If you can’t spare a dollar, send a
quarter. We want your renewal.
AS TO THE PURPOSES OF THE
CITY POLITICIANS.
The Letter.
Deal' Sir:—l have just finished
reading your editorial headed “Mr.
Hoke Smith and the Atlanta Jour
nal,” in which you assert that the
Journal editorially informed us that
the new registration law “automatic
ally registered” the voter upon the
payment of his taxes.
Now, I will kindly refer you to the
editorial page of the Journal under
date of October sth. The Journal’s
editorial of this date makes the as
sertion that when the tax-collector’s
books are opened, he is required to
open the voters list also, and the
opportunity to register is “automat
ically” offered. You say editorially
tnat the Journal asserted tnat the
voter is automatically registered un
der these conditions. Now, 1 assure
you that I keep posted on what you
say, and what the Journal says, also.
1 am sure you misquoted tne Journal
under date of October sth.
1 voted tor you in tne last election.
I have beiore me now the edito
rials above mentioned.
Respectfully yours,
JOHN K. KENIMER.
Leaf, Ga.
The Reply.
Thomson, Ga., Oct. 15, 1909.
Mr. John K. Kenimer,
Leaf, Ga.
Dear Sir:—Yours received. I
never misrepresent anybody, and I
never make a material statement
which is not based upon what seems
to be good autnority. You are re
ferring to one of the recent issues
of the Atlanta Journal, in which
they have been retreating and cov
ering their tracks. It was in Septem
ber tnat the Atlanta Journal made the
distinct statement that when the tax
payer paid his taxes, he was auto
matically registered. The meaning
of the word automatic is “self-act
ing”—thus we say of machinery, it
is a self-feeder, or a sell-coupler. The
Journal is now trying to pretend that
it meant that when the taxpayer paid
his taxes he was “concurrently” given
the opportunity to register. That is
a very different thing.
It is not conceivable that the Journal
meant to deceive Mr. Smith’s own
friends, but they have a very stupid
and a very malicious little wretch
on their editorial staff, and this
man, who knows a good deal
about literature, knows nothing
whatever about law or economic
questions. I think it was his stupid
ity that got the Journal into this
trouble. Instead of a manly ac
knowledgment of error, the little
man has simply been trying to wrig
gle out of his original mistake.
For instance, Mr. Smith was in
New York when the report of the ex
pert accountant, Alonzo Richardson,
was published. This accountant was
the man whom Governor Smith him
self chose to examine the State books
at the time that Pope Brown was ap
pointed to succeed Mr. Parks —there-
fore, the standing of the accountant
must be good. When his report came
