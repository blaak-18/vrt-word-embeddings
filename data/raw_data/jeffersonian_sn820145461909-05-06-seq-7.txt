everything I don’t think there is a
man in the United States that can
equal yourself. I am somewhat like
Mr. Andrews. I agree with you upon
nearly everything except state prohi
bition and I would feel better about
that if they had left it to the peo
ple and I believe you will agree with
me that that would have been right.
Buit after the state had shown that
it was in favor of local option, I think
it was entirely wrong for the legisla
ture to pass it over their heads with
out any showing. I believe in temper
ance, but am opposed to prohibition.
It just simply makes whiskey worse
and costs more money and we lose all
the revenue. I believe every county
ought to own a distillery to supply it
self with pure whiskey and receive
the profits of same, instead of send
ing our money off to other states for
all kinds of adulterated stuff, that
causes suicides, murders and thou
sands of other crimes.
Hon. A. H. iStephens always con
tended that a man had as much right
to make his corn into whiskey for
his own use as he had to make it into
hominy. Here is hoping that you may
keep up the fight for equal right to
all and special privileges to none.
Yours sincerely,
J. C. G. Stevens,
FROM A “JEFFERSONIAN” WO
MAN.
Dublin, Ga.,
Route 7, April 3, 1909.
Dear Sir: I iam no politician,
but I am greatly enthused over your
work. We take tlhe weekly Jeffer
sonian and patiently wait each week
for its arrival. We enjoy reading it
so much. I heard your political speech
at Waycross, Ga., last October. It
was the best I ever heard.
I think those parsons and the Hoke
Smith band that keep chunking at
you will learn to be good after a
while. That’s right, score them on
every hand. I iam anxious to get the
April number of your monthly maga
zine and hear what you have to say
on foreign mission. I know it will
be something good. My husband is
a great Watson man of the deepest
dye.
Will close with best wishes for the
Jeffersonian.
Respectfully,
Mrs. W. A. Keen.
A WORTHY APPEAL FOR HELP.
Editor of Jeffersonian:
As I know all true soldiers are in
terested in our soldiers’ widows, I am
asking help for a good, cultured,
Christian woman, widow of a brave
Confederate, who, when only a school
boy, enlisted among the first and was
a gallant soldier to the end of the
war. He was well connected and
widely known in Georgia. For sev
eral years before his death he was af
flicted with rheumatism, and was un
able to work, but drew a pension.
After his death his wife could not
get a pension, as he was married
just aftei’ the war closed. She has
been sorely afflicted for forty yeans
and is in very destitute circumstances,
suffers agony of physical pain all
the time, land is in need of the neces
sities of life. She is very proud and
sensitive and for that reason I with
hold her name, but if any one feels
disposed to assist her Mr. Watson will
give name and reference privately.

BLACK HAND WORK AGAINST
BISHOP C. S. SMITH.
To the Editor, The Jeffersonian:
We, the undersigned ministers of
the A. M. E. Church, in and around
the city of Atlantia, Ga., having care
fully studied all of the circumstances
connected with the anonymous circu
lar secretly distributed on or about
January 25, 1909, reflecting upon the
personal and official character of
Bishop C. S. Smith, and which was
partially published in “The Jeffer-
Jeffersonian
sonian” of April 15, 1909, which,
when carefully analyzed is neither
true in toto or in part, but is justly
classified by The Jeffersonian as the
work of a “Black Hand.” The said
mysterious accusers not having had
the manhood to appear before a rec
ognized tribunal or any honorable
body, or even the courage to place
their names to the said “Black hand
circular,” or up to this writing have
failed to come before the proper coun
cil and authority of the A. M. E.
Churdli, having jurisdiction in the
trial of bishops charged with abuses.
We must, therefore, conclude that
the anonymous circular is the dastard
ly work of a “Black Hand,” whom
Editor Pendleton of the Macon Tele
graph characterizes as defamers of a
church official whom they can not
bribe nor frighten from the faithful
discharge of the ecclesiastical and
official duties of his church.
We would further say that we have
the utmost confidence in the moral
character and official integrity of
Bihsop C. S. Smith.

SAVE OUR COUNTRY.
Attalla, Ala., March 27, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
Dear Sir: I am a subscriber and
reader of both Jeffersonians, and have
just read your editorial in the maga
zine, “Another Word on Foreign
Missions. ”
This is the best editorial I think I
have ever read. It is my express wish
that every man, woman and every
child that has reached the age of ac
countability, could and would read
this editorial.
We would be better off if we had
a few more men like “Tom” Watson.
The straightforward and fearless man
ner in which you handle this subject,
pointing out the lurking danger in
Roman Catholicism, is enough to put
every man to thinking, and thinking
hard. It brings us face to face with
an issue which some of us have giv®n
very little thought to in the past, and
it remains with us citizens to settle
this problem.
Can any fair minded man read this
editorial and not be convinced that it
is time we be up and doing, to save
our country and not Italy or some
other foreign land?
May you continue to carry on the
good work, and open the eyes of the
American people to the existing evils
which threaten our Government and
homes.
Your friend and admirer,
Walton D. Wikle.
WHEN YOU GET A KNIFE
Free from us, show it to all your
neighbors and friends, and get them
to subscribe to the Jeffersonians.
