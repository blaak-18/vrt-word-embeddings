LOUISIANA RICE
THE UNION COMPANY WITH SIX
MILLION DOLLARS.
Will Assist in the Development of This
Industry-Irrigation on an Ex
tensive Scale Promised
New Orleans, Feb. 27.-The rapidly
increasing demand for Louisiana-grown
rice is attracting attention to the im
mense prairie wastes in this State which
only need irrigation to make them as
productive as any rice lands in the
world, and this has given a wonderful
impetus to the organization of irrigation
companies on a. large scale. The latest
and largest company of this kind to be
formed is the Union Rice Irrigation
Company, the charter of which has just
been filed in New Jersey by J. H. Dill,
the attorney who looked after the or
ganization of the United States Steel
Corporation. The Union Company is to
have a paid-up capital stock of $6,ooo.ooo
a large portion of which has already
been placed among the rice growers of
this State. Dr. R. C. Webb of Rayne,
La., one of the wealthiest` rice men in
America, and who owns over 50,000
acres of rice land, is the prime mover in
the concern. He has been in the East for
several weeks completing arrangements
for organization, and has just returned
here. He experienecd no difficulty in
raising the capital necessary for carry
ing out the scheme which is by far the
largest of the kind ever launched in the
world/ George Bird Castles of Marietta,
Pa., a congressman of that State, has
been chosen president. He has large
financial interests in Pennsylvania and
is well known in trust circles in the
East. George W..Angle of New York
city,,o fthe firm of Stewart, Simmons &
Cot, brokers, is the vice president. Dr.
Webb, Who is president of the Rayne
Rice Milling Company, is the treasurer,
and George W. Sears of Crowley, La.,
i the secretary.
'The lpterstate Trust and Banking
Company, a $2,ooo,ooo concern organ
ized here a year:ago, is acting as trustee,
and its president, W. P. Rogers, is a
large stockholder and will be one of the
diiretorS of the irrigation company. The
stockholders of the new cotppany will
j iheir first meeting in Ne~w Orleans
March I5, when directors and officers
will be elected.
The Union Company will dig a canal I
fty miles long which will take its t,
wa-er from Bayou Coutableau, which is j
a branch of the Atchafalaya river, which
in turn empties in the Mississippi river.
The canal will have its source in St.
Landry parish between Opelousas and r
Washington and will water the great
Hayes and Marmou prairies, bringing t
more than 5coooo0 acres into rice culti- i
vation. a
Close freight connections have been s
made between the new cojnpany and the p
Southern Pacific Railroad Company, a
tap of whici extends through St. Lan- r
dry parish. Colonel S. F. B. Morse, pas- r
ger traffic manager of the Atlantic i
system of this road, came over from 1l
Houston this morning and spent several g
hours in dIose consultation with Dr.
Webb, when it was announced a clear t
working understanding was arrived at. r
When it is known that the supply of
Louisiana rice is this year about 6oo,ooo
pockets short of the actual demand, ne- I
cessitating heavy additional imports, and 5
that the profits on Louisiana-grown rice t
are enormous, the importance of the new ;
company becomes apparent.
It is not probable any of the stock a
willlbe placed or tthe open market for
sale.

NOBLE LIFE OF MANY YEARS
Death of Mrs. Amanda McDowell at the
Age of 71 at Georgetown.
From the Journal, Feb. 27:
A message was received here last
night nnouncing the death of Mrs.
Amanda McDowell at Georgetown, Ky.,
at 11:30 p.m., at the age of 71. Al
though she had been in feeble health for
several years, her death resulted directly
from a brief attack of bronchial pneu
monia. Mrs. McDowell made her home
in Kentucky, but often visited relatives
here and was widely known among the
older families of Shreveport. She was
the last and youngest of a family of four
whose strong personalities and beautiful
characters made them many friends in
their life time. The eldest of these,
Judge Lewis Carter, died two years ago
last September; Mrs. Anna Elstner three
years ago, and Mrs. Mary Rives. two
years agp last November.
Mrs. McDowell was a woman of many
'stimable qualities. Strong of mind in
her convictions, she was gentle of heart
in her sympathies and gave many proofs
f her charitable disposition. She was a
devout Christian and a great worker in
the Christian church of Georgetown, of
which she wais a devoted member. Mrs.
McDowell was much beloved and had
many warm friends here and at- her
Kentucky home who will soryly miss her
presence. She has a number of relatives
in Shreveport. Her nephews and nieces
here and elsewhere are: Messrs. Leon
M. Carter, Rainey Carter, Foster Carter,
Everett Carter of'Fort Worth, Mrs. E.
G. Aller, Mrs. H. C. Rogers, M. C. Elst
ner, foe Elstner of Lake Charles, Claude
Rives, Miss Cecilia K. Carter, Mrs.
Hardy, J. H. Carter Jr., and Sam Car
ter of New Orleans,' and Mrs. Laura
Johnson of Arkansas.
SHOVE 'EM OFF.
Why should any honest, sensible, fair
minded son of toil be misled by the
"clap-trap" of politicians, the political
time servers, the man who has been
feeding and fattening at the public crib
and who pats the horny-handed on the
shoulder or shakes his hand all for a
purpose.
As the Caucasian man is not an aspi
rant for any political office and expects
no "soft job" he would advise all work
ing mer. to "shove 'em off ;" we mean to
let 'em know that you are "onto their
game" and that you are not going to be
"worked" with honeyed words, their
talk, which reduced to United States,
mean "wind."

SILVER ANNIVEftSARY
St. Peter's Cathedr' Packed by *eo

dlobe, Among Them )ne
Ehousand Americans.
ftome, larch 6.-From sunrise yes
terday all Rome was on the alelt and
showing most unusual animation and
interest in the celebraton of the twen
ty-fifth anniversary of the coronation
of Pope Leo XIII. This movement
was especially noticeable at the large
hotels, which were Illuminated as
though for a ball. An idea of the num
ber of people congregating at the
Vatican could be formed by the lact
that it was utterly impossible to get a
carriage if the vehicle had tot been
ordered Monday, especially as it was
raining, and the scene on the piazza of
St. Peter's was manificent. Uhere was
assembled many hundreds of Italian
troops in various eLodern uniforms,
making a striking contrast with the
old time costumes of Swiss Papa;
guards on duty at the bronze doors of
the cathedral. The crowds, whicti gath
ered before the first cordon of troops.
were impatient as they stood dripping
under the persistent rain. There was
a great clashing of umbrellas and gen
eral feeling of discomfort among wait
ing sight-seers, who included very
many women in most varied attire,
comprising foreigners of all nationali
ties and Italians from all parts of the
world. I'he uniforms of the <4owd
were pleasantly broken by groups of
sisters in different gowns of their or
ders, Catholic students and pictures
quely attired friars.
When finally the doors of St. Peter's
opened an almost indescribable strug
gle occurred, in which all present for
got the rules of his holiness and strove
hard with elbows and feet to reach the
interior of the sacred edifice, while on
all sides were heard cries of fear and
imprecations not very suited to a spot
where the notable religious ceremony
was about to begin. Once inside the
cathedral ladies who wore-lace gowns
.I
found them to be in bad condition, andt
some women were carried away in
fainting condition. The tribunes were
soon crowded to overflowing and all of
the best standing places taken. A pe
riod Of comparatively calm succeeded
this great rush and attention of the
people attracted to the gilded throne.
Near the altar the immense pillars
of the basilica were hung with red
silken draperies. Some of,the tribunes
on each of the altars were filled with
men and women blazing with decora
tions. In the group of royal parson
ages were Crown Princess Victoria of
Sweden and Norway,' Countess Ma
thilde of Trani of the Bourbon-Naples
family, the Grand Duchess of Saxe
Weimar, Duke of Robert Parma.
Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg, Prince
Liechtenstein and Prince Maxillian of
Saxony.
In a special tribune was the pope's
family, diplomatic corps and members
of the Order of Malta, all in full uni
form.
After an hour of very fatiguing
waiting the majestic procession began
to appear. It was composed of great
dignitaries of the church, forty-five
cardinals being present in gorgeous
red robes, this alone making the most
imposing characteristics and pic
turesque broup. At 11 o'clock pre
cisely the great bell at St. Peter's rang
put a signal, which was followed by
clanging of bells of about 500 churches
in Rome as they sounded the an
nouncement of the pontiff on his way
to the basilica. The life of the ancient
city seemed to pause for a moment.
Hats were raised and the sign of the
cross made, Shortly afterwards inside
St Peter's silver trumpets blared out
their message and the pantiff appear
ed. The people held their breath for
a moment, and then all pent up en
thusiasm burst forth in a tremendous
roar of welcome.
From his elevation in the new sedia
gestatoria, carried by twelve men, the
pope appeared to )be more than a hu
man being. He seemed to be white in
spirit, this impression being added to
by the pontiff's white robe and white
mitre, his thin hand moving slowly in
the benediction. - As the pope proceed
ed, thousands of voices shouted, "Long
live Pope Leo," handkerchiefs fluttered
in the air, banners of various societies
wavkd and many of those present were
overcome with emotion and sobbed
loudly, .while others fainted from ex
$ss of feeling or fatigue. After the
celebration of mass the pope adminis
tered the papal benediction and re
tired to a room for restoratives, pre
pared on y trpose every time he goes
to St. Pete s. There, addressing Dr.
-Papponi, hqi private physician, the

JOHN DORDEN DROWNED
In Crossing Red Bayou in a Fatboat
Monday Afternoon.
John Dorden is no more. He ewus
drowned Monday afternoon while striv
ing to cross Red bayou in a floatboat or
"bateau." His frail boat was carried
swiftly into an eddy or whirlpool and
dashed as suddenly into a lot of drift
wood, against which the boat was
crushed as an egg shell. In an instant
almost the unfortunate man disappeared
from view. His death has filled many
an eye with a tear. He was a son of
Erin, one of Nature's noblemen, a dia
mond in the rough. We knew Jorn Dor
den when he worked stations during the
construction of the New Orleans Pa
cific railroad, and to many he was
known as "Black Jack," deriving this
cognomen from the'number of "black
jack" trees he had felled and uprooted
while filling his contracts in the erec
tion of the road bed, the sections for
which he had 'contracts. He did' his
work well and retired from this field
with a little money accumulated for a
rainy day. He afterwards sustained
losses in ventures, but he was always
good natured and philosophical. In re
cent years he was engaged in farming
and was doing well. He was always a
staunch friend of the Caucasian, and
when we shook hands recently with a
hearty good-bye and "good' luck, Jack,"
after he had paid his subscription, we
did not think we would be called so
soon to record his death, which is
mourned by his good wife and nine chil
dren. Jack Dorden was aged 61 years.
He was hale and hearty and gave prom
ise of a useful life of many years. But
.tich is the uncertainty of life, and, yet,
living, if we shall receive the respect
and the esteem of our associates, and,
dying, shall be rewarded by the Giver
of all good with the wreath of immor
tality, then we shall not have lived in
vain. It is well with Jack Dorden.
