In 1S94 the Democratic partyi

At present there are 9,017 candi

every three voters. The "dog

It becomes more evident every

it is doing it not to the end of

of the gold-bugs-in the interest
of harmony, you know.-New Or

VOLIUME~ II.
With this issue wwelbein a new
year for the LorUIsIANA POI'I.IT.
For twelve mo.nths the paler has
struggtled for existence and battled
for a principle, with a success that
is at least encouraging. While the
lpalnr financially has been a failure
and has rcsulted in a compldete lo-s
to its stockholdeirs, having been
hIeld up only by the liberality of a
few friends and th dolit, d "l,"
verance of its originators, the
principles for which it ha Iat Itled
have iet with w (tondrfull succt-s ;
and we are thankful for the ptron-I
age of our triends and the ipubllic.
We started ou t to Mnake the Io11
isiana 'Popuilist t State lpapelr, but
Iwe struck the ('Ollul'ty on a boom111
of retni'(' ling prol~'cerity 1lmde'r a
D)emocratic adminiistration, and
contractioui of the cu'rrency ulntier
it contractedl ouir hopes and the
size of our I)alpr just as effectual
ly as it did the pirices of pr4oducts
and labor all over the country, and
we have been comrnlled to limit our
p)aler and hence our field of labor
to a much narrower slhwre.
Someic of our failure to make the
Populist a State ipaper, however,
must be attributed to to the careless
ness and indlifference of many of
our Populist workers. If Popu
lists couhld realize that wherever
they have had a parish paper they
have carried that parish, and that
no movemeni over carried a State
without a State organ, we believe
that they would rally to the sup
port of their home palpers and
make them as good as reform la
pers in other States which have
been receiving the loyal supiport of
Populists at home and here as wel I.
We start this year with sonme ad
vantages that we (lid not have a
year ago, and with a determina
tion born of necessity, we are go
ing.to try to build up a State pa
per that will at least suflice for the
exigencies of the opening State
campaign.
Now, Populists of Louisiana,
will you help us ? If not, we must c
fail, and with it your cause. Re
member that for the past six
months we have been compelled to
make our paper local, because it
had practically a local support,
but with a State subscription list n
we will drop local and secular
news, and give you Populist State
and general news.
Remember, that if this paper is
not what you look for and find in
other State papers, that this one
has practically no State support,
and that you have been helping
other State papers to do what they h
have done, and neglected your own. i
Remember that when you change t
your active and earnest support to i
this paper, that the change in the t
ppearance and usefulness of this t
paper will be quite as sudden. t
D)o not forget that we cannot t
ope to win anything in the next e
;tate election without a State pa
per, and with hearts full of hope I
md determination put your shouhl
rsto the wheel and help usto
urn it. Send us in subscribers, h
dvertisements and job work, and 2
e'll do the rest.
With best wishes for the success
f our readers, hope for a brighter ,
uture and a determination to win, c
we rest our case. h

We have heard various expres- V
ions of surprise from democrats
t one af the leading editorials of
be Enterprise of last week, which
ra clipped from the St. Louis c
lobe-Democrat, a rank Republi
Sas wel as ugoldbug paper.
We also must confess to a little a
urpriae at the tone of that article a
B well as the reading between the
nes of the article headed, "The
tate Bimetallie Comnittee meet
g," for we had understood that o
nder its new editorial mage
e·at the Enterprise was be for li
tver in reality, but we fall to see
sing line in either of the last w
isses that indieates any anxie- c
Sfor the msccess of the silver
ovenment.
We reeeived no exchange from a
SPeople's Demmads this week, 1

v 'Ihrou zh a pronminent small farm
er" our neigrhlbor, tihe Enterlprise,
h ias at last disco cred the oiriin:al
1 and only reason why the People's
t party was organized.
t We are unde1r many olligations
Stoo the lnterprise for this. valuable
s informialionl which we iave Ibeen
, unalhle to ob1tai.n ,Iswlhiere. Il;ut
We shall 1 t 1 forget iln outr coilpli
mnt'ns, that "proliiiont smiall falrm
St"" who 1as I,1("1 of such i|,c i
Siblhe service to the Enterl,risv.
It (,ceurs to u; that the Enter
Il ire owes a great de(lit of grat i
tdih to the fa rors ,f this parish.
esIIcially tlio nllthose farmiers who are
small, hil lprominent: who can't
read atn who can't spell. ro the
Stwo, Ilatir t'clahssh s the Enterprise
owctI its clear a:id logical informta
lion on the money question, which
a few mont hs a_,o it was diisclensin,
in favor of the gol standard : and
now it is under equally great ohli
I gations to a small, but plrominent
farmer, for one of the startlin,_
discoveries of the hour.
l:it oillir readerIl';iS must know the
discovery. a:s given in list week's
Einterplrise by said small, but prom
inent farmer.
Yo]u see the ,Demiocratic party
has ever been against office-hold
ing. and it lhas been the bigge-t job
the leaders hlwve had to find men
willing to fill the oflices, esplcially
those that have fat salaries attach
'd. Even the prcsenlt editor of the
Enterprise, patriotic as he is, could
not he induced in the last elec
tion to go into the C('lerk's office,
notwithstanding the very good sal
ary attacied thereto.
Now, as in all ptlI moveimients,
there were somlle "bldak sheep' in
the I)emiocratic p1arty who wanted t
office. and as that was aiirint the
rules, they had to) get out. So, for
inltual pirotection, these office- t
seekers formedll the Peole's or 3rd'd y
party. a
Now all of this has been discov- R
ered by "a pronminent small farm- 0
er," and revealed by the Enter- t,
prise, and is very eneouracing to
the said office-seekers, for as the (t
People's party is the office-seekers' ii
party, tho office-seekers must all "
conlin into it, and this will insure us (
a very large influx froni the present sI
DeImocratic party, as we know of
seven candidates for sheriff, and a
two for clerk, and lione for repre
scntatires in that party.
We are a little puzzled to know t
what this parish will do for replre- t
sentation in the next Legislature, ri
as neither party offers any candi
dates, but the Enterprise's '"prom
inent small farnner" seems to think
that as the People's party contains n
all the patriotism, it should furnish w
the leislatiie ticket. Well we p
think so too, and we'll just attend
to that job a little later on, so that A
the Enterprise andl his three farum- d:
crs lmay sleep sounlly through the
ba!anco of fly time.

cotton of his section, and supposed
to be the first of the parish. Said wi
place is in the very nest of the C
Populists, and should have been th
called Populist station. Mr. Jno. mm

POLLOCK, LA., Aug. 17th, '95.
SMr. H. L. Brian:
i Dear Sir-Please allow me space C
r- m your paper to answer a letter
[e writen by R. L. Tannehill, in which
a- he states that I am an office seeker, Cr
also, states that I supported the
,f Lafayette combine.
4 Now Mr. Editor, in advance, I
d will say that I fought the Lafayette
4 Combine from start to finish, as
n the records will show. Further- Ct
. more, I supported the Populist
- ticket headed by R. L. Tannehill;
I worked thirty days and spent one Ca
t hundred dollars of my own hard
earned money. I do not regret it;
I would do the same again if it
was to do over.
Now then, as to being an office
seeker, I have this to say, that I
am not a candidate for any office,
r as I have no political aspirations;
nI have been asked by many of my cm
s friends to let my name go before
the people of Grant parish for
Representative to the Legislature,
but I have never agreed to do so,
e believing there are many'men more (
suitable than myself. If I can see t
every man have an equal opportuni- C
ty to make a living, it will be earth
f lyglory enough for me; to wet
Sthis, we must stay right in the t
middle of the road, and if we fall;
we will fall to ripe again. cal
- With best wishes, I remain yours'
