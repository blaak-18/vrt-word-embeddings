And then there is Jackson over in
Mississippi, where The Nctws has
this to say:
‘ ‘ The News has received the first
issue of Tom Watson’s Magazine*
known as Watson’s Jeffersonian Mag
azine, and published in Atlanta. The
first issue is a very interesting one
from start to finish. Mr. Watson
gives a detailed aecouiit of his doings
with Coh Mann* he of Town Topics
fame, who now owns Watson’s Mag
azine, published in New York with
Watson out of it, and from what Mr.
Watson says he was given a very
rough deal by the man who’ was ex
posed by Collier’s Weekly. The News
has nk>t always agreed with Tdm
Watson, but has always admired his
sterling courage and his steadfast
adherence to what he believed the
best interests of the people. His
magazine is to be political and liter
ary combined. In the first issue he
hits Hearst a hard rap for nestling
with Boss Murphy, whom he had de
nounced, and hits Bryan a lick for
swallowing Hearst and his Murphy
deal. One thing is certain, Watson’s
Magazine is going to keep the ani
mals agitated.”
M
In faraway North Dakota The
Fargo Forum says: “Hon. Thomas
E. Watson, in the openi-’g number
of Watson’s Jeffersonian Magazine,
flays Colonel Mann of Town-Topics
to a finish. It will be recalled that
the colonel secured a judgment
against Watson’s Magazine in New
York and froze out the editor, who
has started a new magazine to take
the place of the original, which was
published in the metropolis. ’ MJr.
Watson is decidedly radical, but no
one will question his honesty and un
rightness, and he seems to have the
best of the present controversy.”
Out in Texas, that sterling guar
dian of the public weal, the Cleburne*
Watchman, with which the magazine
has a clubbing arrangement, says:
“Subscriptions are coming in to
Watson’s Jeffersonian Magazine. Ev
eryone who has seen it says without
reserve* that it is the betfl.” The
Pioneer-Exponent, of Comanche, says
it is “in every way up to the expec
tations” of Mr. Watson’s “most ar
dent friends. It is full of good
things* and is far ahead of the New
York magazine, which he has repu
diated. Watson is one of the most
brilliant writers of the times, and he
•will undoubtedly accomplish much
good with his new magazine.”
n
The Adams County Democrat, of
Hastings, Neb., says: “Mr. Watson
is the most interesting writer on po
litical topics that we know of. He is
sound as a dollar on about all public
questions and comes nearer giving
value received to his readers than
any publication of its kind. Send
for a sample copy of his magazine
and sete for yourself.”
The Beacon, of Broken Bow, in
the same state, says: “As a mag
azine for the family, it surely has no
superior. And withal, it breathes
the spirit of radical reform. Tom
Watson Ought to be ehcouraged* Had
he sacrificed his convictions, he
might have beeh in the United States
Senate. But he has chosen to stand
by his convictions and battle for the
cause of the common people.”
The Crofton Journal— ctill talking
about Nebraska remarks that
“there are editors gifted with a de
sire to roast somebody but without
the ability, but if you want to get
the real article hot off the griddle
you should send and get the first
number of Watson’s Jeffersonian
Magazine whjcb Thos. E. Watson is
now publishing at Atlanta, Ga. He
tells the inside history of his connec
tion with the Watson’s Magazine of
New York and it is a masterpiece
in the roast line.”
And the* Grand Island Democrat
(quite a bunch of them from Nebras
ka) says:
“Watson’s Jeffersonian Magazine
comes to our desk this week, and it
is a most creditable publication. Tom
Watson was squeezed out of the Ne*w
York Watson’s Magazine because he
refused to allow Blackmailer Mann
of Town Topics fame to dictate his
editorial opinions. But Watson is
too brainy a man to be suppressed
in this manner and he bobbed up se
renely at Atlanta, Ga., with a new
magazine which outclasses the New
York publication.
“Mr. Watson is accused of being
radical, but there is no reason why
one should not be radical in the ad
vocacy of truth. He tells the truth
in such forcible language that it
makes the guilty squirm.”
Which the same will have to do
for this time, though we omit, for
the present, many of the most nota
ble and most generous.

Wanted Santa Claus to
Bring Watson 9 s Magazine.
There is one boy in Atlanta, at
least, who believes that Santa Claus
is a delightful reality. At any rate
letters addressed to -him bring re
turns promptly and just according
to request.
In The Atlanta Journal, shortly
before Christmas, among the let
ters from children telling what they
wanted for Christmas,- appeared the
following:
“Atlanta, Ga., Dee. 19, 1906.
“Dear Santa Claus: I thought I
would write and tell you what I
wanted. I am nine years old. I
want an automobile, ballbearing, and
a knife. A book, 'Treasure Land,’
and also Tom Watson’s new maga
zine. 'Some nuts, candy, apples and
oranges. Your little friend,
“Van Allen Pierce.
“36 Chapel St.”
This little stray paragraph chanc
ed to fall under the eye of the edi
tor-in-chief himself, and he prompt
ly wrote the following leter to Master
Pierce:
Thomson, Ga., Dec., 1906.
Master Van Allen Pierce,
36 Chapel St., Atlanta, Ga.
My Dear Young Friend: It was
only by chance that I happened to
see in The Atlanta Journal your
wish that Santa Claus might bring
you my new magazine.
As Santa Claus quit coming to see
me about forty-two years ago, I am
afraid that anv request which I made
of him might go astray. But if you
The weekly Jeffersonian.
will accept me as a substitute for
him in this particular instance, I
will take pleasure in putting your
name on the complimentary list of
the magazine, and thus you will have
received what you told the Journal
you wanted.
With best wishes for your future
usefulness and happiness, and with
Iflxe compliments of the seasbn, I
am,
Very truly yours,
(Sighed) Thos. E. Watson.
In due course Mr.. Watson received
the following reply:
Atlanta, Ga., Dec. 30, 1906.
My dear Mr. Watson:
I was very much surprised to re
ceive a letter from you in answer to
my letter to Santa Claus in the At
lanta Journal. He brought me every
thing I asked for except the maga
zine, but I reckon he thought it was
too far for him to go to your house
to get it, or too late to write to you
after he got my letter, but I will ac
cept you as you say a substitute and
thank you too. I read everything I
can get. lam nine years old and am
in the fifth grade, Walker street
school.
I have rdad “Ben Hur” twice;
“Pilgrim’s Progress” and other
good books. I read all the late mag
azines except “The Smart .Set.” and
“Town Topics.” Mamma won’t let
me read them. I have read many
tilings from you. I like what you
write because you are not afraid. I
read what you "wrote to “Poor Pol
ly” Pendleton and thought it was
good for him. I will close. I thank
you so much for the nice present, the
best I received. A Happy New Year
to you and the “Jeffersonian.”
Your little friend,
Van Allen Pierce.
