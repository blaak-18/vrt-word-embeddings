Something of Tnterest.
The couidition of the finances of
Natchitocheis parish calls for some ac
Lion, some investigatgation. For some
years past they have been anatiagedl
with shiftlessness, amounting in most
inlstlcees to :a erime. The parish is
flooded with indebtedness in the shape
of war'rants, certificates, &e., and
the Courthouse is cruammled with
.judgmients and other claims against
us. The w'riter of this, was, kist year
uipon a Committee appointed by the
'eople to examine and report upon
dtheelalius fih in- jad~nment. After
nimuciJ.iearerb and a laborious, work,
investigtitig -"* mass of claims
amountinlg to 80 or 100 thoustand dof
laII'N,, io de'finite plan of action could
be submitted to the considleration of
the people, fot the reasons that, the
mass enibraced so. much that was
knowni to be fariudlcutr, so mDIcli
that was believed to be so, and so
much that was doubtful, embracing,
all told, fully 75 per cent in the three
cla:s es named, that the Committee
could not tell what to do, and referred
the :matter to the' people for aethn,
where circumstances have left them
at rest, to this momenat.
They are evidently in a "crooked"
shape, as they stand, and will create
lneasiniess and distrust, until dons,
away with. At some future day these
judgments in the hands of scheming
men and with a corrupt power in of.
flice, ill certainly be used as a means
to defraud. The fraud still slumbers,
and will be ftanned into litfe at the
fir'rt opportunity. The cause must
he removed, before an effect is pro
duced; how to accomplish this, re
quires deliberation, candid thought,
and the actin of trighttoned, honest
aphdl capable fitizenM; ,citizens unin
etecsted io:plllhalp or manner, with
judgments or judgment creditors.
Ofur idea is this: to have an' gct
passed i'by the regislature at its cou
jing session, naming certain parties of
the class, mentioned, to co-operate
with a certain number of persons
'named by those who hold claims
against the parish, for, the purpose
of examining, passiing npenl the cor
rectness, atd Auditing anch just
clarms that may be out. In this man
ner A mass of fraudulent; debt can be
wiped out, say, at a low estimate, 50
per Tent, or sue-half.
The duties of this' "Andit Boarid"
slhould be, to also cancel and destroy
those fraudulent warrants, &c., and'
to issue a new series of papier, to be
redeemed as hliereibafter ' tated, in
place of that pronolnced just;, said
new issue to be made for the face ral
ve 'thereof onlU, the accumulated in
terest to be lost by the holder, which
they are willing to naccedbe to. A
large amount is due the parish, in the
way of back taxes, much more, in
tfct,.than the whole claime, frandn
,lent and jnst, against the parish
amount to, and the new issue can be
,marked on its, face as receivable for
such tases whose levy they wereW.s

To My Fallow-Citizans.s
I am not obllivious of the faict, that
many wilr consider this a strange line
of conduat to pursue, in the finee of
such a card as E. L. Pierson has pre
sumed to indite and j'blish, concern
ing myself. I do not do so, however,
with any intent to satisfy the morbid
desire of many, but simply as a jus
tification of my acts to my friends.
'Those who know 'me personally;
those who know imy antecedents are
well aware that iu.mjr past rontlc It
thlrohgh life has been such, flint tlie

I propose now to give to the public
rny realsons, succinctly stated, and for
thie truth of which I ain willing to conch
my life and my honor, for declining to
accord to E. L. Pierson that right

Card of Citizens..
We, the '`citizens of the parish of
Natchitoches, State of Louisiana,
having learned ot certain charges
mnade ndet oanth before the Con
gressiongl Commiittee. by oue E. L.
:Pierson, stylizg himself a representa
tive from this parish, and a republi
can, against our people in general
and Col. Wnh: M. Levy, oir tepresenl-.
tative eleet to the Congress of the
United States, -'in particular, hereby
iprnonounce the said charges all andil
paiticular to be false, slanderous and
mnnlicidns, and intended solely to tra
dute and villify the good people of
Natchit:ches, and injure t he standing
anud character of Col. Wm. M. Levy,
that the said Pierson nnmay therebSy
further lis neftrious schelmes. Aind
we furthler deci:,re, that, the character
andastanrdintg of the said E. L. Pier
son, is notoriously bnad, and that he
has not thieconfidlence and respect of
any diecent person in this couiininity.
That from his early imanhood lhe has
been totally unreliable, both in word,
:eat. andl tcedI ; that after the late war,
during which his conduct was such as
to forfeit the confidence and esteem
of all li8 people, by hlis acts of do
ertion and forgery of pay accounts ;
the gMidl people of this city enter
taining tihe highest respect to, anid
confidence in his, the said E. L.
Pierson's fttlb, '- 0... e>.rlJ., --- r -_
promise pf the said E. L. Pierson,, to
lead in future an honorable and lIon
eat life, and attributing his said acts
of desertion and forgery, to the igno
rance of youth, he was assisted and
encoureaged in every manner by our
people, and to our certain knowledge
more particularly by Col. Win. M.
Levy, whom lihe now in a most vil
lainous and outrageous manner at
tempts to traduce.
We further declare that we would
not believe any statement made by
the said E. L. Pierson upon oath,
thndf |is cliarneter'as a lawyer even is
bad, he having eimbczzled the funds
collected for his client in suit, and
we fatther declare that we are pre
pired to substantiate any and all of
the within: hssertions before any Court
under- oath.
, We do not in any manner tolerate
this lman's statement to abuse the
confidence aind esteem with which
we 'now hiold and will always hold
Col., Wm. M. Levy, and we consider
that it is our duty as good citizens, to
pronounce the statements made in the
testimony by the said E. L. Pierson
'to tihe said Congressional Committee,
against Col. Wm. M. Levy, to be a
mean, malicious and a slanderous lie.

self from personal responsibility, nor
do I object to lmeet any fricid of E. L.

Iam more than willing to meet any

Barking of Cure.
The history of the gigantic ring
formed in this larish in 1872 or '73 is
too well known to require reittera
tion ; the 1 indfeator has exposed it in
1874 ; earlier the. courts did the samue.
But to come at this hour and charge
in the face of stuch ticts this, "stupen
dious crime upon the Democrats is
such an outrage as to demand atten
tion.
Tl'hat some Democrats, as iuadiridu
al$, specuhitel. iri the parish wyiiney,
we will not deny, nor did we ever;
tlieo The "f'ffem:ed the penalties of
their act and it is not our province to
talk of the Attioun of simple individ
ulfs, but as ipparties working to op.
press the people. It seems strange, bdlt
it is nevertheless true, that the very
men who so 1prsistently defended the
members, and the manner of Boullt's
ring are the most blatant howlers
against it at this moment. While
Bomdllt, MyerA, David Boullt, Bossier,
the tax collector, district and parish
judges, the parish attorney and clerk
of the police jury, and the corrupt
police jury were being driven out of
otlice, the men who then defended
them and their acts are now seeing
great virtue in the acts of the people
,at that time. It does them no good,
gauzey not to be seen through. The
card was played last year by the peo
ple and has been decked ; it is useless
to try and take it from the board and
lead again. The trick is too well
known; it is the people's game which
they intedd to play themselves.
No sooner does C'ol. Levy depart
for Washington than he is assailed by
a vile sheet, representing nothing but
negroes and worse men, a set of rapa
cious rascally scalawags. Of this,
Col Levy and his friends care naught,
but it shows the cowardly animus of
these fellows.
lie is so iaofaitely above this scum
that any tirade they might bring to
bear upon him would receive no ere
dence, save from a certain xclass of
political fidgets. These are of that or
der of nature of whom *.i is said,
"those creeping things 'that riot in
the decay of nobler natures. It is not
every dly that tlii}avage envy of as
piring dunces is grmtifiect by the a'gony
of such a spirit and the degradation
of such a name."
Low in nature, birth and education
-foul in associations, they have no
ambition, save to degrade all virtue,
intelligente and respectability to a
level with themselves. With those
that know thil gentleman to whom we
allude this article will not be called
for, it is intended not as a defense of
his character, that is above reproach,
lu!t simply to call attention to the faict
that these'radicals not only refiuse to
meet them on that field where only
gentlemen can meet, but they take
occasion to hide thlemrslves from
the publicstreets afterwards and to
denounce absent people; to charge
them with.crimes they hive commit
ted themselves.
The beginning of the end4e ithhand
and each individual will be expected
to do his duty. If this work for the
people of Natchitoches is all talk then
let's have done withl it. It is nonsense,
childsplay'and ill ::bcomis men. If
the people afiltceitoches propose to
be robbe~d outraged and then insult.
ed we hae nothing more to say. In
future let us iall keep quiet hdd allow
these fellows their way.

We will venture to say that there
never has been as great a demand for

lands to sell, and hundreds are want

whisper :in your ear :how yoh can
reach the buyer,, how lhe an find you,
and how you can put money in your
pocket, build up the wealth and pop.
ulation of the parish, and be rich
yourself. ADVERTISE. We have a
proposition to make to you, broad
and liberal. From and after this date
we will advertise lands for those that
wish to sell, on the following terms :
twenty per cent of the bill of adver
tising, which will be at usual rates,
in cash, the ballance to be paid when
the land or real estate is sold. That
is more than fair, forero take 80 per
cent of the risk our~lvns. Send as
