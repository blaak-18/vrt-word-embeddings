Hon. II. W. Ogden is telling on
the stump that the Populists in
Congress voted for the duty on
sugar, and is attempting to make l
great capital of it. We will not
discuss nov as to whether they did
or did not, but if they did their
votes were defeated by the Demo
crats, of which fact Mr. Ogden
boasts, To use a stale expression,
"The proof of the pudding is in 1
chewing the bag," mo let us exam
ine results. Under the McKinley
law the people received their augar
free of duty while the United States I
paid bounties to the sugar planters
aggregating $13,000,000, which r
went to the sugar planters of
Louisiana.
Now under the Democratic law r
of 1894 the average family pays
$7.00 duty on the sugar he uses an. I
nmally, 53,000,000 of which goes I
into the pockets of the sugar trust.
Now which is the least of the two
eylls, paying the sugar planters I
$13,000,000 or paying the trust
O53,000,000? It certainly does not
take a smart man to answer this
question. We would like to sek e
Mr. Ogden if he explains this to
the people as he goes along.
Special reduction on clothing,

IN MEMORIAM.
SDied at her home in Montgomery.
Grant parish. La., on Tuesday. October
Hth. 1994. Mas. ELMINA HAKRISON, wife
of Mr. W. . Harrison. aged 42 years.
10 months. 7 days.
Mrs. Harrison. whose sudden and un
ud timely death, cast a gloom over our en
tire communiity and brought a pang of
grief to so many hearts, was a native of
s Ouac'hita parish, La., and the daughter
e- of Mr. and Mrs. A. V. Ragan.
A pure, true life has passed from this
at world to the life immortal beyond. A
le . devoted wife and loving mother has been
called to a brighter sphere. Patient
. among life's trials. smoothing away the
e rough edges for her husband and chil
. dren, self-sacrificing in every thing.
Mrs. Harrison was a woman among
r women, and to all who knew her, and
Ã½" knowing loved her, she was the emilodi
le ment of a true woman in every sense of
the Bibical saying. She was a Christian,
having made a profession of religion
in early in life. and adorned her profession
ae hv a consistent, Godly life, being amem
tt her of the Methodist church. 1Her life
was full of sunshine and happiness.
She always gave to others a kind greet
ing, and by the power of love in her own
heart, which is the secret of all true
politeness, she won for herself many and
it lasting friends.
t. "All times are thine, 0, Death!" Nev
rt er is the awful significance of this sad
truth more keenly felt than when the
great Reaper bears his arm and lays low
the most cherished plant of the house
hold-the mother. Mrs. Harrison has
gone to dwell in the Paradise of God.
1. Hers is gain, ani though she has left a
vacancy in the home, the social circle
and in her church that cannot be filled,
yet, "We sorrow not as others, who have
no .hope. for if we believe that Jesus
o died and rose again, even so thun also
that sleep in Jesus will God bring with
him."
To those bereaved, how sorrowful,
how changed is e erything ! May sub
mission to God's will bring comfort to
the solely stricken ones. L.
Montgomery. La., Ot. 16. 1894.
