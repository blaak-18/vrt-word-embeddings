Before the finance committee Sec

Congress and Country Get
Nowhere With Buck-Passing,
Pussyfooting and Gabbing
(Burma of I’ultllcnllon uiul Kducatlon)
WASHINGTON, D. C., March
12.—Let’s take another look at
the political situation while we
are indoors and March weather is
at its worst. We have heard a
lot about the slush funds, partic
ularly as to oil, and now we are
kept indoors by another slush,
composed principally of snow,
rain, sleet and high winds. This
nasty weather won't last long,
and three months from right now
we will be in the midst of na
tional conventions in Cleveland
and New York, and the merry
month of June will be with us.
Presidential primaries are going
on all ar>und us, and within a few
weeks all the delegates to both na
tional conventions will have been se
lected and the roar of political bat
tle will be heard on all sides. Dem
ocratic leaders in Washington are
growing more and more confident
from week to week of victory, and
they now feel positive that any good
Democrat can win.
On the other hand. President Cool
idge and the Republican leaders are
becoming more and more confident
every day that the man in the White
House is going to be nominated with
out any trouble, and elected after a
short, sharp skirmish with the en
emy.
>lnj I'se Big Stick
It begins to look as though the si
lent, careful, cautious, conservative
man in the White House might res
urrect Teddy’s Big Stick and pro
ceed to use it pretty soon on con
gress. The president sent congress
a little message this week that had
a stinger in it; it sounded like the
crack of a whip when President Cool
idge asked congress to lay aside all
other issues before it right now and
get busy and cut the 1923 taxes for
the benefit of the taxpayers of the
country. The country, as a whole,
will like that.
Then the president proceeds to tell
or intimate to congress that it has
been in session three months and has
not enacted into law a single one of
the 58 specific pieces of legislation
which he recommended in his first
message in early December. No
president likes to recommend and
then have his recommendations ig
nored. Therefore, Mr. Coolidge is
likely to drag out the Big Stick and
commence using it pretty soon, if he
expects to accomplish what he start
ed out to do.
Nothing Bnt Investigations
The trouble with congress is that
the fellows up on Capitol hill have
forgotten that they are sent here to
legislate and they seem to have
turned into investigating bodies and
nothing else. The country is going
to get mad one of these days and say:
“Oh shucks, what do all these in
vestigations amount to any way? It
looks like it is all being done for
political purposes and every body is
playing tne political game fcr all it
is worth. It makes us tired. Why
not get down to real serious busi
nesf ”
Lenroot Resigns
Chairman Lenroot, of thte oil in
vestigating committee, has sent his
resignation as head of that commit
tee to Washington from down south
where he is resting and trying to re
gain his health which he claims is
shattered by hard work the last three
months at the head of this investi
gating committee. He says he now
realizes that he is nearing the point
of complete exhaustion and gives up
his place to another senator.
Now the country wants to know if
all this gossip, rumors, reports, plain
gabble if you please, for the last
three months is to get us anything,
or is it all to go up as a smoke
screen. The nation is more than
anxious that all mystery about this
affair soon be cleared up and let the
country count on some tangible re
sults. If it don’t, the country is
sooner or later going to regard all
this fuss as one big, grand bluff.
Government Still Lives
However, the government at Wash
ington sti'll lives and there is a lit
tle less hysteria in the air right now
than there was weeks ago. People

STORM LAKE. IA.. March 18. The
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan have

A meeting was recently held in a

The Storm Lake Tribune makes the

are sort of losing interest as the af
fair has dragged along for such a
long time. It is conceded here that
the McLean telegrams have done the
president no harm, but Mr. McLean,
the Washington and Cincinnati pub
lisher, has not helped himself in the
least. He is disagreeably involved
and the country does not like his re
luctance to clear up a lot of things
that has been going on by wire. He
can at least go on the stand and clear
up the mystery about the fruit crop,
by showing who is meant by Apples,
Peaches and Apricots in his tele
grams.
Attorney General Daugherty, of
Ohio, is not going to do like Secre
tary Denby did. He is not going out
until he is put out, if he can help it.
So it looks like Washington is to have
a few more explosions and sensations
that may rock the country before the
week is over. There is no telling how
much big stuff will come out of the
Daugherty investigation but the
country might as well prepare for
sensations.
Many Ring Circus
Washington has been having a one
ring circus'with the oil investigation
going; now it is to be enlarged to
two-ring with the attorney genera:
performing in the other ring; and it
may develop into a three-ring cir
cus as a result of the Chicago grand
jury indictments of two members of
congress, which may bring on an
other investigation.
Every one is guessing nowadays as
to who is to be the new secretary of
the navy to succeed Mr. Denby, who
is out and gone to his home in De
troit. Michigan people are now talk
ing about sending Mr. Denby to the
senate when they get an opportunity
as sort of vindication for him and to
show the loyalty at home for the
man. The new secretary of the navy
has not yet been named but Wash
ington is expecting to hear the news
any day.
