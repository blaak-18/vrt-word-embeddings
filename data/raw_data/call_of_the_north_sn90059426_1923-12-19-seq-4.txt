FACES MURDER CHAR6E
-K-K-K
Man Who Participated in Carnegie
Riot Charged With Firing
Fatal Shot.
—K-K-K
Pittsburgh. Patrick McDermott,
the Roman Catholic undertaker who
participated in an attack on the Ku
Klux Klan while that organization was,
parading the streets of Carnegie the
night of August 25, has again been
arrested upon a charge of murder in
connection with the killing of Thomas
R. Abbott, Klansman, who fell a vic
tim to the murderous mob.'
McDermott was released after an
investigation by a coroner’s jury im
mediately following the events which
led up to the murder. The action of
the officials in the matter was the
subject of much condemnation by the
law-abiding citizens of the common
wealth at the time. Following a- hear
ing last Friday before Justice of the
Peace, W. H. Prosses, of Carnegie,
McDermott was arrested and held
without bail on a murder charge.
Two witnesses at the hearing iden
tified McDermott as the man who
fired the shot that killed Abbott. The
prosecution against McDermott was
instituted by the widow of the dead
Klansman.
"TOITF JUSTICE"
TO BE SHOWN SOON
—K-K-K
Motion Picture Near Completion and
Will Be Staged in Colum
bus Shortly
—K-K-K
Columbus, Ohio. Announcement
has been made here that the film pro
duction, “The Toll of Justice,” spon
sored by the Ohio Ku Klux Klan, and
designed to acquaint the uninformed
public with the true principles of the
organization, has virtually been com
pleted and will have its premiere pre
sentation in Columbus within the next
few wepks, it is understood.
The movie is said to be one of the
most spectacular screen dramas ever
produced and hundreds of person took
part in the big scenes. It is designed
to counteract the poisonou s propa
ganda circular by alien enemies who
have declared their determination to
wipe out the Klan.
Since the original announcement
that the film was to be made the un
dertaking has been ridiculed by a sup
posedly neutral press and everything
possible done to prevent its comple
tion.
A recent dispatch, published broad
cast under a New Yor date line, de
clared that the “producers have en
countered difficulties which spell fail
ure for the proposition.” Even then
the final scenes were being filmed
and the work of titling and assem
bling was well under way. Reports
also were circulated to the effect
that the director had withdrawn from
his task and was to sail for Europe
“to take up' travelogue work in
Egypt.” Corey G. Cook wrote the
scenario and directed the making of
the picture and, notwithstanding the
rumors to the contrary, he did not
desert his post until the production
was completed.
“WETAGEHTrWONT
THAT’S ALL
The point of the prohibition
gency is here: the law is being “en
forced’ 'by men who don’t, believe in
enforcing it. In other words, the ma
jority of the “dry agents” tire “wet
men.” This conditions obtains in
every state. All scandals grow
out of it. Sometimes the “dry
agent” have been used as a special
police to protect the bootlegging
traffic of one big owner of liquor
against the encroachment of smaller
bootleggers. Sometimes honest dry
agents have stumbled on to the tricks
and evasions and violations of the big
owner, and have been transferred or
discharged for their pains. If the
public mind were not already satu
rated with tales of malfeasance in
office high and low, such a flood of
information on the above points could
be poured out as would shake even
the government at Washington.
The situation is not complicated at
all. Dry men will enforce the dry
laws, and wet men will not. The tip
is free to Secretary Mellon and to
all the governors. With regard to
cabinet responsibility in this matter,
the tip is free to President Coblidge
also.—Dearborn Independent.

KUNSMEN MARCH
WITHOUT MASKS
Dad? City, Fla. —More than 200
members of the Ku Klux Klan of
Florida took part last week in the
first daylight parade ever held in that
state, the Klansmen marching un
masked. At the conclusion of the
parade the Klansmen circled around
' the courthouse and were addressed
by two Klan speakers. ,
A month ago the Klansmen were
refused the use of the courthouse or
the public school auditorium for an
open meeting, but the demands of
the people to hear the Klan speakers
were so great the authorities were
forced to permit the speaking and the
parade.
MYTHICAL “REVOLT” IS
FOES LATEST WILD TALE
One of the latest “stories” by the
opposition is that of a “revolt of
2,800,000 members of the Klan,” and
which story appeared during the past
week in the majiy newspapers of our
country. As is usual in such “stories”
the whole thing is without founda
tion. The enemy, it is becoming even
more apparent, is striving in every
way possible to stir up strife within
the ranks of the Klan organization.
However, such wild 'statements ais
carried in the press dispatches of
last week get the foe nowhere.
“A widespread revolt within the
ranks of the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan,” declared the “story” lyith an
Atlanta date line, “in which 2,800,-
000 members voted to withdraw from
the national organization, was de
scribed here today.”
Unfortunately, thedescription-was
not given in the “enlightening” dis
patch. Therefore, the public must
continue in ignorance—unless some
of the imaginative writers of the op
position jump into the breach and
furnish the missing description. The
continued growth of the Klan, despite
the frantic efforts of the enemy is
causing much confusion Tn the ranks
of the foe.
IDAHoIIANSMEN PRO
GRESSING; GREAT
MEET AT TWIN FALLS
Twin Falls, Idaho. November 26
was a day long to be remembered in
Klanraft in Twin Falls. On that date
100 Klanswomen were presented to
the Exalted Cyclops of Twin Falls
Klan No. 4, Realm of Idaho, and in
the presence of 250 -Klansmen, mem
bers of Twin Falls and a few visitors
from Butte, Burley and Shoshone.
The oath was administered in the
solemn and ’impressive manner.
This initiation of Klanswomen be
ing the first class of the ladies’ or
ganization and marks the beginning
of an intensive drive for the better
ment of the public schools (purging
them of Catholic teachers) and civic
improvement. Another class of 50
ladies are in readiness for the next
naturalization, arrangements are now
'being perfected for an Xmas natural
ization, of both Klansmen and Klans
women, and to make this event the
crowning event of the year’s work.
The ladies, however, have the Twin
Falls Klan No. 4 bested, as they have
been working less than 60 days and
now have a membership of over 150.
If the same percentage of enthusiasm
was shown, time being the essence
of the membership drive, We should
have all the eligible 100 per cent
Americans in Twin Falls county as
members of our organization. We
have, however, been growing by leaps
and bounds since the ladies have be
gun their work and both are work
ing hand in hand, the goal, being the
same with both organizations.
CATHOLIC STUDENTS
DESTROY BIBLES
(From The Gideon Magazine)
The football team from Loyola
College, Chicago, a Catholic institu
tion, played with a team at St. Louis,
Missouri Saturday, November 10.
With their priest, they stopped at the
Marquette Hotel and threw a lot of
Gideon Bibles from the windows of
their rooms that day. The Bibles were
salvaged in a bad condition by the
housekeeper. This act is in line with
one which occurred in San Francisco,
a priest from Napa City being the
other offender. There is no question
as to who perpetrated these contemp
tible offenses against our Gideon
work.
It is time for Protestants to come
out in the open and to call these
offenders by their right names and
to hold them to account. Similar de
scriptiono have previously been re
ported to Archbishop Mundelein of
Chicago, in a kindly manner, the mu
tilated Bible being sent to him, and
he did not deign a reply. The na
tional officers will not doubt follow
up these cases more vigorously here
after. Please report any such case,
if authentic evidence can be had.

Marion, Ohio.—The purchase by
the Marion county Ku Klux Klan of
a new two-story building recently
erected here by the Knights of Co

is likely that two stories .will be
added to the structure by the pur
chasers, as provision was made for
that in the ofiginal building plans.
A reading room, clubroom and

the near future and the purchase
represents an outlay of $125,000.

KLAN WANTS CLEANUP
—K-K-K
Revolting Conditions Shown in Chi
cago Night Life
—K-K-K
Vice conditions in Chicago have
been described in “Dawn” from time,
to time and the Ku Klu* Klan in this
city is using its greatest influence
to clean up the city cesspools of in
iquity.
That the picture painted by Klans
men has not been overdrawn and that
still more drastic effort must be
made to eradicate commercialized
vice and other evils is evidence by
the investigation and report of social
service experts.
' Chicago’s night life presented the
most revolting spectacle of any place
in the world. In an around-the
world investigation of vice conditions
nothing was found in any other place
that compared with the scenes in the
Entertainers Cafe, 209 East Thirty
fifth street. *•
That is the opinion of Mrs. Mina
Van Winkle, chief of Washington’s
force of policewoment, expressed in a
review of her world vice investiga
tion.
“White girls dancing with
black men and white men were danc
ing with black girls,” Mrs. Van
Vinkle declared in describing her
visit to the Entertainers. “They danc
ed in a way to the bac
chanalian revels that preceded the
fall of Rome. The dancers seemed to
doing little more than rubbing
their bodies against each other to the
senuous strains of the wierdest jazz
music I ever heard. It was the most
disguesting sight I ever saw in my
travels.” \
Landis Closed It
The Entertainers cafe was closed
by former Judge Landis when he was
on the federal bensh. Two weeks later
it was re-opened On a writ of super-;
sedas. It is still open.
“I think Chicago has a vice con
dition that is more difficult to handle
than that in most American cities.”
Mrs. Van Winkle continued. “The city
is doing wonderful things in the way
of supressing vice. Its commercial po
sition as the depot between the east,
west, north and south must keep it
filled with a footloose element that
is difficult to control.”

Reports that regalia emblazoned

A copy of the invitation, said to

Romanized Sheriff Failed to Make
Good On Chajrges
—K-K-K
Sheriff Felipe Zamora failed to
make his case against the seven
Klansmen arrested near Albuquerque
last week while they were preparing
for a lecture on Americanism, Pat
riotism and Law and Order. ’ Zamora
set up that these Klansmen were on
the highway, dressed in robe and hel
met, in violation of the New Mexico
anti-mask law. The Klansmen were
on their own leased property and the
court found that t£ey werp more than
one hundred yards from any road: and
dismissed the cases. Sheriff Zamora
knew there was no violation of the
law. He no doubt was carrying out
the orders of Rome to disclose the
identity of as many Klansmen as pos
sible in order that the boycott might
be applied to those in business as
that is their favorite method of fight
ing. It has been done everywhere a
member of the Klan has been exposed
to their viciousness. To covA: up
their tracks however they accuse the
Klansmen of boycott and the subsi
dized daily press carry out their in
structions and play their game work
ing diligently impress this false
condition on their readers. The law
abiding, liberty loving people of Al
buquerque and surrounding country
should feel a personal obligation in
assisting those Klansmen in business
who have been uncovered. The anti
mask law was passed by the last
legislature, an interpreter being ne
cessary as the bill was written in
English. Zamora put on a grand
stand out op the prairie he
and Salazar and Lujan made the ar
rest. He drove inside the gate onto
the leased property, leaped from his
car with a 30-30 rifle in one hand
and a 45 six-shooter in the other and
cried: “You are under arrest. I’ll
show you how to wear hoods; move
two feet I’ll shoot; I am going to
walk you back to town.”
„ The Klansmen were them ordered
in line for the march back to town.
They refused to form the line inform
ing Zamors that they were willing to
submit to areest but insisted they be
allowed to take care of their families
and return to town in their own cars.
The sheriff finally agreed to this ar
rangement. His ruse to get the
Klansmen on public property failed
to work. With an officer in each car
they drove to the county jail and
found four pjess reporters waiting.
The Morning Journal gloated over the
arrest and said the robes worn by the
Klansmen apparently were home
made and of sheeting material. The
robes were home-made in these old
United States, where the white man
was supreme, and by the grace of
God, the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
will make him supreme again. For
the further information of the Journ
al, the robes were made in the large
robe factory of the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan, its wheels running twen
ty-four hours every day so that the
needs of the newly made Klansmen
throughout the United States may be
supplied. These robes are made of
the best sheeting material, from the
cotton, and those who are in position
to know say the demand has been an
important factor in raising the price
of cotton to thirty-five cents per
pound. Public sentiment is highly
aroused in Albuquerque, in favor of
■the Klan and applications “for mem
bership are being filed so fast that it
is almost impossible to handle them.
The fight is on in New Mexico and
the native-born white, gentile, Amer
ican citizens will win against heavy
odds. * _•

Coolidge on Immigration
President Coolidge made a bid for
Klan support in his first presidential
message to Congress which he read
to the joint session of the Senate and
House on Thursday. His fine Amer
icanism came out in his proposed
immigration restriction paragraph as
follows:
“American institutions rest solely
on good citizenship. They were cre
ated by people who had a back
ground of self-government. New ar
rivals should be limited to our ca
pacity to absorb them into the ranks
of good citizenship. America must
be kept American. For this pur
pose, it is necessary to continue a
policy of restricted immigration. It
would be .well to make such immi
gration of a selective nature with
some inspection at the source, and
based either on a prior census or
upon the record "of naturalization.
Either method would insure the ad
mission of those with the largest ca
pacity and best intention of becom
ing citizens. I am convinced that
our present economic and social con
ditions warrant a limitation of those
to be admitted.

DISMISSED
The ease against the 250 Klans
people,. including men, women and
children, who were arrested at Ports
mouth, Ohio, on Sunday, October 28,
while on their Way to dedicate a cor
nerstone for a new church, has finally
come to a conclusion.
As we frequently and persistently
predicted should be the case, the
charges against the Klan members
were—DISMISSED.
The city solicitor who prosecuted
the cases against the F(lan in police
court, made a motion to sustain the
“motion to quash” the affidavits filed
against the Klan organizer and divers
other persons on October 28, when
Police Chief Distel placed the organ
izer and 244 Klansmen and women
under arre&.
The municipal judge then an
nounced that the motion was sus
tained. '
The charge was that they had vio
lated a city ordinance which pertains
to the unlawful congregation of per
sons in public*places.
The motion to quash the affidavit
was filed by attorneys for the de
fense. They set forth in their mo
tion five separate reasons why the
affidavit against the organizer and
divers other persons should be dis
missed. The motion was sustained
on the strength of the fourth reason,
which was as follows: “Said affidavit
fails to set forth the names of the
persons wfto are alleged to have been
annoyed by the congregation of" de
fendant and others.”
The court room was packed by men
and women interested in the outcome
of the case, which has been hanging
fire for several weeks.
The action of the court will prob
ably settle the case,- as the injustice
of the arrests have been apparent to
everyone since they were made.

The first ballot oh this fight re

Senator Cummins fell three votes
short of election and two more bal

had only a slight change from the
first and the third ballot was exactly
like the first.
No election resulted on this im

went into executive session and the
fight will be resumed Tuesday. All
the other Senate committee assign

as presented by the Republican and

Senator LaFollettee is the ranking
member on the old interstate com

to hold on to that asignment as well
as retain his place as president pro

It is not believed that Progressives
will yield in this fight in the Senate
as easily as the Progressives in the
House did last week, the latter crowd
now realizing that they made a mis
take. That mistake was costly to
them and Representative Nelson of
Wisconsin, Republican insurgent lead
er, is already threatening another
fight on the floor of the House
against'what he terms a “stacking of
House committees.” Failure of in
surgents in the House to obtain more
places on the important committees
led to a forecast of another revolt
against majority organization leaders.
Representative Nelson expressed
surprise and indignation over the
treatment which, he said, had been
accorded his group in the make-up of
the Republican committee slates and
said the fight would be taken to the
House when the selections made by
the Republicans were presented for
ratification the latter part of this
week. The House adjourned today
until Thursday noon on account of

London.—England is having it£
first modern taste of the Ku Klux

This secret society, whose objects

drawn from exclusive social circles.
Tts • avowed aim is to promote me

Tuesday it became known that the
order is waging a war on gambling

heavy gambling among their guests,

“We have approached these hosts
and without speaking to them in any

eyes we look upon its folds and in
holy devotion we bow to this altar

it has converted the world into a
