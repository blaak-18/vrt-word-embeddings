The 3ode and the Tafilfer.
T'1'rle seems to i' lI no opposition to
a ehak(In at last in tihe organic law of
Toili .ianin. Ill fart tlhe argumentlis ofi t
tlif4An who oppllose the mere alling ,f
Ia C(onvlntioln :re all in favor of a
cel::an. in the Constitution. (
That being the case, the qnuestion
at argninent bet ween the people of
this State is not in the wllfer of a
('onstitntion, but in the amauner of its n
leilng framed. Narrowed down to
this antd strippetd of the soundliing
braliss and tinkling cymbal with which
the numerous opponents have graced t
their articles, it is purely a contest
between a D)emocratic principle on
the one hian:d andi the imperial aunto
eracy of poinderous "ins" oil the other.
Thie principles upon which this gov
ernmllent rests, and which thlise sanme
'-ins" delight to paraphrase in tlowery
rhetoric anld Asuging eloquence at
''clection time," demands that the peo
pic shall ,frame their own organic
liw; the "nutocracy" deny! that the
people of Lonisinna have thin mental
ability or the virtue equal to that
task, but require them to sunlmit
their rightits to suc(h "Commnission"
as tihe legislittre may conll.itlte,
who will tell the people just how
much '"Constitution" they can have,
anlld that they can accept, or let alone.
For our part we Ioldly proclaim in
nidvanc'e, that we will oppose all
nlendmentsrlfs sllnlmittad b their cnn
temp!nted Commission, squarely on
princilple! lllntherskites and denia
gegnes may prate as they please of
"blsiness interests," "peace and qui.
et," and of "disturbing elections,'"
and such clap trap, but we contend.
and will show to tihe satisfaction of
any honest man, that all our troubles,
all our discontent, these hard times,
sprung dlirectll from an attempt to
foist nlupon the peple of this state a
govern ment unrepublican in form,
and to cram down our throats a Con
stitution imperial in its essence and
degiading in the abstract.
Hayes is now receiving applause
all over the South, simply because lie
was forced to adopt the Democratic
principle of allowing local govern
ment full sway, and now certain par
ties propose to the manhood of this
State a manner of adopting an organ
ic law more shameless than that used
by those who framed the present
odious inst'ument in 1868, becanse
they had at least the decency to hide
the sheen of the 'bayonet behind
dcmocr'aic forms.
We stickle for forms. There has
been too much innovation upon time
honored principles and precepts, and
the virtue of our forefathers is sneer
ed at too much by a certain class of
men, whose sole ambition seems to be
confined to opposing every good and
wholesome move made to benefit a
people, and in never proposing any
thing thenmsaelves.
The New Olennas Item informsus
that a bill ihas been prepared and
will he presented to tile Legislature,
to fund thie floating debtof lthis State,
created since tihe adoption of tihe
present funding law and exehlded
from its operations in interest bearing
bonds.
The litem, very properly opposes
any lsuch scheme, and our legislitors
should at once know that the people
are wid'e awakeo to the knowhldge that
the issune of an interest Bond in lieu
of a non interest bearilng obligation
is a very poor settlement for tihe
taxpayer.
A vast nmajority of these outstand
Ing cnaims are the veriest steals, and
thie Ifem tfvors thleir "purchase out
of thie delinqnuent general fund tlax
collections" by the Slate.
Tile Item says:
"The scihmeie may evoke some hif;thalu
tin sentirmentality albout repudiating
hlonest olliglitions, lint these will coime
mainly from tile uIncky few who cn get
walnallts cashed at the tresanury. 'The
city biy. in thi preminlum and other bonds
out of wiiinuigs in her own lottary, gettilmg
about three dollars in debt calnceled bIv
one in cash, and is considered to be doing
a snart thing financially. Then why not
the State buy in her evidencers of delts
from willing sellers, evenc if Treasurer
Dubielet's "legal adviser" should suffer a
little Ih his mind, and brokerages and
some other of that official's friends have
their pocket nerve shlcked ? The State
iiever re.eived fair consideration for the
Lnlk of these ontstanding warrents, and
no one can blame Ii r for taking theni up
at fonr or live for one, eslpecily as the
holdersl are willing, aye, auxious, to rea
lize oin evenl tlhse terms.
If yomt go to thie bank or a friend
and borrow $2.50, of course its re
turn would be just and expected, yet
there are plenty of nice gentlemen
lwho read thie VilKDICITOw every week
and have done so for thie last thirty
weeks and never once think it costs
money to get tint f;aper up, and
Ithat their first duty is to pay the
Editor that $2.50 tliey honestly owe
hiim.

Article 147.
From this time forward we trust no
I),enm:ratic newspaper. Democratic Gi
stateaiiln, ofliial or citizen will say us
otight against the speedy' assemblling h1
of (', nstitnfionl(' Convention. Na'y, 1
untless they mal I xpress detciitded opin- pl
iolns and evince faith ,y work on this ch
important sitlhijet, and to the end th
ithlt it may le anconmilIishi(d. they p,
are 1op'en to serious reflection, and are p
jitstlyv liable to be charged witlh mn
tives which, to say the least of it, io
are tinpat iotic. Y
Oppo)nents to the ('onstittutionoal c
Convention have been met at all at
points and severely routed, antd now vI
the \'iNDtc'.rn desires to hurl ci
against the weak lines of the factiotns ci
opponents to "Lonisinnas' redrmnp- to
tion." a solid cohort that must must end to
all their hitherto weak war of words. z
All admit that the present Consti in
tftion mu,.st be ehcr,,edl, and to that tc
end .Irlicle 147 of the document st
which we are laboring to amend, pos-. s
itively bars the way, except by a st
Convention. No sane man for a mo- oi
ment imagines that ''"two-thirds of the
members elh'ecrd to each IHouse" will k
agree to nny amendment of practical si
benefit. If there be such a man, we It
pity him lnmre for his weaknless than ti
for his stpliditv.
The Radical memllers of the as- il
senmbly will vote in a solid hldy in "
both Hlouses, against any chantge that (
hlhs oft' an official or cuts down a
salarv--that restricts the legislatore, s
curtails the power of the Executive, It
or gnards the rights of property, I
that being the case, the Democrats. t
not having a "two-thirds vote of the )
members elected, are without power C
to even propose an mendmell nt upon t
which the people could vote that i
would be of any benefit at all.
Legislative amendments being out I
of the question, let those few who
have suggested them take up the a
sword for a Convention, or else they i
may be charged with duplicity and I
demogogism. a

Assessment.
SEvery one will admit that the as
sessmnents in tlhe country parishes at
least, are a failure, and this failure
can be, in a great measure, attributed
to the law. For instance, it is a
Smatter of utter impossiility for the
parish Assessor to place a fair valn
tion upon property, becanse the law
allows thIe owner to choose one of two
neighbors, who must be land owners,
, adl nccessarill interestedl in a lote icl
nation, the tax Assessor choosing tlhe
Sother, who choose a third, and tlhey
Svalue the property. This is whlen
thie owner refuses to submit to the
t generally fair valiation placed upon
it by the Assessor, whichl they do nine
times in ten.
The law is grossly imperfect, worse
even than the Radicalnt law, which
made certain officers tihe assessors.
A State Board is tile only way to
arrive at a fair uniform valuation of
Sproperty in the State, and until that
system is organized the city of New
Orleans will continue to pay, and
unjustlS, over one half the State
g taxes.

Not Worthy of ('ouni;eration.
From a 1mutual friend we learn
(;en. John Young of Claiborne desires
us to criticise letters frorp" him, which
hanve appe:red in the columns of the ph
Mindren Democrat over the ,norr de tit
phlue of "Pine' Woods," favoring th
chang(es 1by Legislative enactment in co
the present State constitution and op,- ii
posing a convention for that pur
pose.
With diue deference for the opin- "
ions anid high character of Gen M
Young, we beg to state that after a an
careful peInrusal of all his letters we co
are more strongly in favor of the Con- w
vention than before. General Young
cites the new martlter required to he
embraced in the present constitution Ir
to make it respectable to the white
tax payers and to the patriotic citi
z71n and suggests a mancner of i lject
inig that matter so un-republiecn as st
to debar discussion. lhe desires, to
state it simply, that the General As
sembly shall submit to the people
such amendments, for their adoption
or rejection, as it may see fie. si
General Young knows, or should
know, thlat no amedmhents can ' he
submitted to the people without first
having passed the ordeal of a two- it
thirds vote in their favor in both
Houses of the Assembly. Not two
thirds of the melmbers voting but
"two thirds of the memnlber's elected."
(See Art. 147 State Constitution.)
We do the General credit when we
say, he has no idea that a single rad
ical vote will be c:ist for any amend
ment which would prl:'tically benefit
the people of the State. General
Young's plan might work if the ne
cessary two-thirds vote coruld be had
but that is known to be an impossibil
ity.
From this fact we consider it quite
useless to "criticise" the Generals'
"plfn" farther, because it would he
a simple mnultiplication of words. Let
it be well understood that there is
but one ray! to redeem Louisiana, and
as onur friend of that able conutry
journal the Ouachita Telegraph, just
ly and pointedly inays: '"Lonisirina
will not be redeemed untili it is done,'
anid that is by and through a civilized,
honest republican constitution, which
can be had in but one way--by a con
vention of the representatives of the
people assembled for that purpose
and fresh from their loins.
Bureau of Immigration.
The Shreveport Times very justly
complains of the action of this Bureaun,
which is fostered and encouraged by
the whole State. We have not yet
seen the "panimphlet and map" issued
by tihei, but suppose it to be in the
interest, as usual, of tihe "Jetty sys
temrn," or of "SMorgan's Railroad, and
thie Tecrhecountry." Denniet exhiibits
hiis stupidity every time hie attempts
to talk of Louisiana, and when lie
leaves Iris Teclhe des.ription, his igno
rance of thie State is so manifest as to
disgust hris readers. Northi Louisiana
pays taxes to suplport tile government
of this State, and it is but simple
justice to allow her at least one of
thie nine rmenlrers of thie Ininigra
t tion Bureanr.
