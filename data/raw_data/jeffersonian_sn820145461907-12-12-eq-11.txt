Dear Sir: My subscription for your
Weekly and monthly expires on De
cember 7. Enclosed find check to
cover subscription, and also your
story of France in 2 volumes, Life of
Napoleon and Life of Jefferson, and
half-dozen copies of your Weekly
containing your speech before the
Fanners’ Union, in January, I think.
I had a dozen copies, but have given
them out. It is a speech that every
man who has an interest in the wel
fare of the whole people should read,
think and then re-read.

SOME CLOSE QUESTIONS.
Fitzgerald, Ga., Nov. 16, 1907.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Your response of the
14th received. I would make sure that
you have in mind, when considering
present wild-cat money, the manner
of securing these bank certificates,
viz.: the banks form a clearing house,
then from among themselves make a
board of trustees, composed of their
bank presidents, then the banks de
posit with these trustees securities
for certificates, $1.50 of securi
ties for every dollar of certifi
ficates. Now, then, the banks need
all their assets to enable them ro
strike a balance. But what becomes
of the balance, if the assets are hy
pothecated; especially so when they
figure certificates as assets? They
can not figure both the securities and
certificates as assets. If they figure
the certificates and not the securities
they are 50 cents short. What a game
of shuttlecock this must make!
This is circulation on a gold basis
with a vengeance.
Yours respectfully,
JOHN B. STEVENS.

Dear Sir: Enclosed find money or

The long-looked-for has come at
last. The Democrats in Kentucky
have been snowed under. They lost
from 35,000 majority to 17,000 against
them —52,000.
I send a clipping that states the
facts. I hope the legislature will put
Beckham out. I had rather have W.
O. Bradley, a Republican.
It was fun for us old mid-road,
long-haired Pops to see the old par
ties wool-pulling during the campaign.
All we did was to say “Sic ’em
Tige.”
Kentucky has been a disgrace, po
litically, ever since the Music Hall
convention that nominated Goebel.
Well, you haven’t time to waste on
my scribbling.
Yours truly,

Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Sir: Your card of 11th
received. I intended to renew for
Jeffersonian and magazine. Put it off
too long. Sorry that I troubled you
to write. Will do better next time.
I used to take the People’s Party
Paper as Tong as it lived. Have every
magazine and Weekly since they be
gan, except ones used to convert sin
ners around me. I have three
brothers. All take both Jefferson
ians. Have five boys and two girls,
to all of whom I am trying to teach
real Democracy. One boy is named
James Watson. If I ever have an
other to name, it shall be called
Thomas Watson. With hopes for
great success in your work.

Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson: Your letter of
29th ult. received. Since I wrote you
about ten days previously, I have
been looking over Jas. G. Blaine’s
“Twenty Years of Congress,” and
in it I see that he unstintingly gives
credit to Andrew Johnson for the
passage of the Homestead Bill,
though he says: “Mr. Johnson was
not the first in Congress to advocate
the measure.” Mr. Blaine does not
say who was the first man in Con
gress to advocate it, but, as I wrote
you, ex-President J. Q. Adams was.
He made one speech for it before
Johnson entered Congress in 1843, and
that ended his labors on that ques
tion.
As I view it, you sustain the same
relation to the inauguration of rural
free delivery that Andrew Johnson
did to the Momestead Bill.
The late Senator Allen G. Thur
man, of Ohio, spoke to me in highest
terms of Blaine’s capacity as a his
torian. He said his book was writ
ten in such a fair, impartial spirit
that a European reading it, unfa-
WATSON'S WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
miliar with American political his
tory, would not know to which party
Mr. Blaine belonged had he not told
it in giving the names of all Con
gressmen who voted on certain ques
tions, and included his own name in
the column headed “Republican.”
I don’t think your enemies will be
able to rob you of the glory of intro
ducing rural free delivery. Truth
may be obscured by falsehoods, for a
time, but eventually it will triumph,
unless the arbitrament be by arms,
and in that case, as Napoleon said,
“the heaviest battalions will win.”
I send you by this mail an account
of the death of Judge Temple, who
authorized me, about a year ago, to
give you his testimony that General
Jackson was a citizen of Jonesboro
before he ever saw Nashville. The
same newspaper gives an account of
the death of Colonel Moses White,
who promised me, weeks ago, that he
would send you material on Jackson,
but, I suppose, did not.
Yours trulv,
JNO. B. BROWNLOW.
A LETTER FULL OF INTEREST.
Grand Prairie, Tex., Nov. 15, 1907.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson: I enclose you
one of my little books, which I trust
you may take time to read. I will
place my advertising matter this
week. By the 20th the inquiries will
begin to come in, 15 to 20 letters per
day until the close of the seed sea
son. If you desire a copy of these
addresses, I will mail them to you
from time to time, and make no
charge for them. I thought probably
you would like to mail sample copies
of your paper and magazine to these
farmers. If the names are worth
anything to you, you are perfectly
welcome to them.
I have the best cotton known in the
South. If you desire to plant a bush
el of them on your farm, I will give
you a bushel, you pay the express,
charges.
As I once lived near Athens, and
met you there on several occasions,
I always feel like I have known you.
The last time I heard you speak was
at Athens. We were very poor peo
ple then. My three brothers and I
walked ten miles that day to hear
you speak, then ten miles back home
that night. My father and mother
drove in that day in an old buggy,
working a blind horse. We were all
Watson people then, and we are
Watson people now.
At the close of your speech I took
you by the hand, and in my great en
thusiasm exclaimed that you were the
greatest man in our Southland, the
Athens Banner next day referring to
your speech and the reception your
people gave you, said that my com
paring you to Toombs, Stephens and
Hill was like comparing the humming
bird to the great eagle. I thought
you great then, Mr. Watson, and I
know it now. No lies were too black,
no words too harsh in those times for
the democratic papers to hurl at you
and your followers. They have stolen
the greater portion of our platform
for campaign purposes only. Ido not
mean to try to flatter you, but you,
are the onlv man that we have ever
had in Congress that ever tried to
legislate honestly and sincerely in be
half of the common people. You
gave us rural delivery, and now old
Lon is trying to steal that honor
from you. I heard him make a
speech at Toccoa at the time that
the Alliance began to sweep over
Georgia. He told what a good al
liance man he was, and closed his
speech by telling of the words that
he was going to have placed upon his
tombstone; how true he was going to
be to those great principles of the
Alliance. I wish I could remember
his words along this line. They were
beautiful to listen to. If I were
called upon to write his epitaph, I
would write just one word, and that
word would be “traitor.”
Asking your pardon for taking up
so much of your time, I beg to re
main, Your friend,
D. Y. M’KINNEY.
P. S. —If you have an extra copy
of your Fourth of July speech at
Douglasville, long ago, please mail it
to me. I had the speech as published
in your P. P. Paper at the time, but
I have actually worn it out. At one
time, years ago, I knew it by heart,
word for word. I consider it the
greatest democratic speech ever made.
It is true that I am not a competent
judge, but it sounds good to me.
D. Y. M’K.

Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My dear Sir: Enclosed find check
sos $4.60, with exchange, for renewal
of your Weekly and magazine; also
Jefferson Bible, and Review of Re
views.
Now, I fully believe you deserve
some flowers in this life, as well as
after death. I have just returned
from Central Alabama, where we
have some farming interest, and
stopped over in Birmingham and
Montgomery, and I find hundreds
reading your papers, giving you great
credit and praise for your able ar
ticles, and the manly way you have
of stating facts as they exist. This
is not only the situation as I fre
quently see and hear it on these
trips, but on all others where I go,
and it fills my heart to overflowing,
knowing as I do, the needs of the
hour. You, my dear friend, are do
ing for the people and good govern
ment more than you can imagine.
Your periodicals are read by thou
sands who are not subscribers.
May God extend your days for
many years to come, and may your
pen never rest, and when the inevit
able comes, as it must come with us
all, may he do unto you as he did
unto Moses —kiss you to sleep. Then,
as you rise beyond your friends
who cross be! we you will greet yon
with “You have kept the faith,
fought the good fight ; enter into eter
nal joy,”
Tnd v your friend,
WM. L. PEEK,
