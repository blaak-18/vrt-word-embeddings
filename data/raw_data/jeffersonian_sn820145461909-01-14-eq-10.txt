THE STORY OF THE SWITCH.
(Continued from Page Three.)
“Would you have me go to Marion
Yerby and tell her, and you have al
ready told her? How could you?
How could you?”
Never for a moment did her anger
betray her into the slight tinge of
dialect she was heir to upon weighty
occasions. But now for the first time
she seemed to realize that Miss Yerby
knew of her mishap.
“How could yo’ tell her?”
“1 didn’t, I didn’t,” Breckenridge
whispered. “Some one else told her
first. You must have told someone,
or else someone in your family told
someone,” he stumbled.
“I-I breathed it to nobody. Oh, but
I did. too! She dared to tell, did she?
I’ll—I’ll—”
“Please think no more of it, Laura,
please don’t. I—l’ll see what I can
do.”
He left without saying good-night
and thus ended this auspicious inter
view.
Every sweet Southern romance, a
romance in every way worthy of the
name, has a god hidden away in the
wistaria and the honeysuckle. Our
deity appeared upon the afternoon of
a sunny southern day. You may have
noticed that the sun has a partiality
for certain mountain tops and other
favorite spots. Now, if there is a
place where the sun revels in full
glory it is in the suburbs of Mem
phis. The recesses of tall palms and
magnolias absorb the brillant flood
of sunshine; summer houses, clothed
in vines and creepers, offer places of
refuge; the broad, wide verandas are
the lolling places of those too listless
to walk in the enervating rays of the
sun.
It was a bright summer’s day. Too
irritable to either sleep or drive or
walk, Marion sat with her mother,
attempting to read. Mrs. “Lady”
Yerby was embroidering in a sort of
whole-hearted fashion and paid little
attention to her daughter. But finally
when Marion closed the book with
an energy much stronger than neces
sary and sighed more deeply than
customarily her mother looked up
from her work and observed her.
Then it came to her thoughts as if
almost for the first time that her
daughter was seventeen now, and a
lady. That she had many beaus, of
course, the strict matron knew. But
all the girls had their string of beaus.
However, but for short calls at the
home, occasional sweet stolen inter
views, rare drives, chaperoned tallyho
and theater parties, a friendship
between a young lady and a young
gentleman went no further. Mrs.
Yerby knew that as yet no suitor had
spoken needless words of love for the
simple reason that she would have
heard him if he had. Still, she well
know of Breckenridge’s infatuation
and what is more, was glad of his in
sanity. Why shouldn’t pretty, deli-

we await?
“Marion, that’s a big sigh for a
little person. Story sad?”
“No, just dull, Lady.” She sighed
again.
“What a woeful sigh! Tell me your
trouble, sister,” the youthful mother
said.
“Oh, it’s nothing, mother, nothing!
It was a yawn on a small scale, that’s
all.”
“Now, Marion, I have a question
for you. I think you can answer it.
Why hasn’t Allen been here?”
Marion looked very uncomfortable
beneath the frank gaze of her mother,
and for a moment answered noth
ing. Then: “You shouldn’t ask me
that, mother, please.” The pathetic
maiden entreaty won Mrs. Yerby.
“Very well, child,” she said, very
gently. “But some day I’m sure
you’ll tell me.” Silence fell between
them. The slender white fingers of
the elder lady hastened to obey her
serene will, while the younger one
sat with clasped hands, seeing noth
ing. But she was thinking hard and
striving to come to a decision. Two
minutes had barely elapsed before
Marion, rising suddenly, rushed to
her mother and fell on her knees
before hr. . She buried her face in
her mother’s lap and sobbed bitterly.
“Oh, mother, mother, I must tell
you!” she said, brokenly. “There,
there, my child, that sounds as sweet
as watermilyun to me. Os course,
you’ll tell me.”
“Why, Allen, Allen, oh, I can’t tell
you, can’t!”
“Marion, dear, listen. Remember
the time you were a little miss of
eight and you laid out grandma while
she slept ? Remember that you
whitened her face, folded her hands,
let down her hair and dressed her in
white linen for a shroud? Now you
frightened grandma very badly, but
you came and told me about it. I
gave you a lecture and forgave you
and I told you I always would pardon
if you brought the truth to me. Tell
me of what great sin you have been
guilty this time and I’m sure—”
“Sin, mother? Ls it—is it a sin,
to —love?” The last word came in a
mere whisper.
“Oh, no, child, not at all! Os
course, a good deal depends upon
whom one loves. Who has your love,
child?”
“Oh, mamma, I can’t tell yon! I
think I could tell old mammy and
she’ll tell you, “the girl’s eyes bright
ened at the idea.
“It’s not necessary, dear. I know
all eady. You see a mother knows a
