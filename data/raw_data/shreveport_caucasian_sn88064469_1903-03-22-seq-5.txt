"What is the greatest mistake girls
make, in your opinion?" asked little
Miss Debutante.
"Telling their troubles to other girls,"
responded Mrs. Worldlywise promptly.
"Lord help the innocent who does that!
The number of women -who cannot
keep a secret is positively appalling.
The shortness of women's friendships
is also appalling. Now, while there are
women who will keep secrets as long
as a friendship lasts, there are prac

"I can continue on this subject for a
good hour, for certainly the way of the
average girl is simply peppered with
mistakes-mistakes for which she has
to atone very heavily at times. If
there is anything I despise, it is the girl
'rusher,' for instance, the politic girl
'rusher.' She discovers that you give
little Sunday evening affairs, for ex
ample, or that you have a lot of men
friends. That settles it. She becomes
introduced to you, she 'dears' you and
hangs around you until you invite her,
then she haunts your house morning,
neon and night until she has annexed
all your desirable friends, principally
those of the male sex. When your
parties become fewer or else ancient

over again. Then there is the intense
sort of girl. She writes you intermina

the telephone and say whether she has
hurt your feelings. Oh, why will a
girl have the Interminable letter craze

WHAT WOMEN CAN DO.
Here Are Two Who Have Proper
Physlcal Development.
Things one woman has done may at
any time be done by another woman.
Think on that proposition. Physical
development is at present neglected
among women to the extent of a posi
tive sin, a sin against their beautiful
bodies. Physical development is what
the sex needs today. tlow strong and
splendid and able to take care of tself
the feminine body is when properly
trained you may know from the cases
of a little girl and a young woman I
shall tell you of. Their stories will
demonstrate to you what you feel in
your bones already-that the alleged
weakness and cowardice of woman are
not really natural at all. but an arti
ficial growth upon our civilization.
First there is Bertha Eloise Grant.
cow girl of Arizona. It has been said
that no cov joy rough rider in Arizona
is the equal of this fourteen-year-old
girl. That is probably stretching
things, but she is certainly as skillful
and fearless a rider as any man among
the world's leading horse heroes, the
cowboys.
Physically that female child is the
most happy and fortunate who has no
women over her to constantly repress

telling her little girls must not run.
Jump and climb trees or do this, that or
the other because-heaven help us!-it
'Isn't "nice" for little girls to do these
things. Oh, the sins mothers and
grandmothers and aunts will have to
answer for btecause of their stunting
of the physical development of little
girls! They have done it centuries un
til the most stupid, helpless, ignorant
human creature in civilization is the
middle aged and elderly woman. Now
let the stunting be stopped for good and
all.
That a splendid physical develop
ment in a woman is entirely compati
ble with purity of thought and modesty
is proved by the brave cow girl, Bertha
Grant. Wherever she is known she is
mentioned in terms of admiration and
respect, yet this girl has been riding
astride in a divided skirt since she was
old enough to sit upon a horse, and she
knows no other way. She says she
does not see how it is possible to sit a
horse and? other way than upon the
cross saddle.
"If I were riding in a big city, I
should do it just the same," she says.
"I would imagine I was going to fall
off all the time if I rode a sidesaddle."
"Broncho buster?" Oh, yes. She has
never yet found the range horse that
she could not master. The cowboys.
whose pet she is, taught her horse
breaking, and now she can do it with
the best of them. Then, too, her ad
miring, devoted father has been her
constant companion from her child
hood. The broncho has a bad name
for stupidity. treachery and obstinacy.
but Bertha Grant says:
"Bsonchos are hard to manage, but
after you have them trained they are
nearly as intelligent as a man. Once
they know their master, he can do any.
thing with them."
One hardly knows which to be more
enthusiastic over, this Arizona girl
horse trainer or that Maine woodswo
man, Mrs. Freese. Her camping ground
is 'the region of the headwaters of the
Penobscot, with which she is probdbly
more familiar than any other person
living. She has absolute control over
her nerves, never loses her head and'ls
a noted hunter of game, large and
small. She is a fine wing shot. She is
rather slender In figure, but perfectly
strong and healthy, and she gets this
splendid physique, mark you, by active
outdoor life, not drudging, stooping
over the soil, nose to the -ground, but
by long tramps and canoe trips. She
was born with the woods love in her
blood. No narrowing, stunting female
pruning could starve it out of her. Now
she makes her enthusiasm pay by con
ducting hunting and tourist parties
through her beloved haunts in forest
and by stream. Maine has 1,800 reg
istered and licensed guides, and of these
fira. Freese is one of the most skillful
as well as noted. Her nearest hunt
ing ground is fourteen miles from her
home, nine by canoe, four afoot.
In the heart of the forest she has a
winter lodge of logs. There she goes
upon snowshoes and camps when the
woods longing surges over her soul in
cold weather. At these times she cuts
holes in'the ice of the Penobscot wa
tere and catches fish. All this, bear in

Miss Rogers. She is a slender, delicat""

the high school had driven away sever
al teachers before her because of unril
liness and disorderly behavior. They
thought to make short work of the new
teacher. Led by the captain of the
football team, six feet tall, the fellows
refused to come to recitation. One
slight secret, however, these ungallant
boors did not know. Though little, the
new teacher is mighty. She is a train
ed athlete and learned the womanly
art of self defense at Wellesley col
lege. When the captain of the foot
ball team showed insubordination, it
seemed that a flash of lightning struck
him in the nose. Blood flowed, and the
captain of the football team went down
upon the floor. Next came the next
biggest high school bully who thought
to defy a woman teacher. In the time
of another flash of lightning he lay be

had scared off so many teachers. Now

What is more, their dress was beauti

gowns, of black, dark gray or blue

A married woman jeered at her for be

times he was drunk. Besides that, the

GOWNS FOR MOURNING.
Many of Them Beautifnt Creations.
Widows May Wear Hats.
We all know that everything, wheth
er good or had, has its compensation.
and therefore we are prepared to find
a sort of subdued comfort in elegant
ly cut and fashioned garments, even
though they are designed to ,xpress
sorrow and mourning for the dead.
One might even say that the fashion
able mourning gowxns are mwade more
carefully and beautifully than th.ose
for ordinary occasions. The skirts are
made to conform with the most stylish
of the modes of the 'lay. IHairtloh
and featherbone give them the -ash
ionable tflare at the base and cause
them to fall in rich folds at the bot
tom. The materials used vary to a
great extent. according to the age of
the wearer and the degree of relation
ship. The silk warp eudora still re
mains the one thing for elegant first
mourning, but after that come soft tex
tures of silk and wool mingled or of
silk alone in some clever crape weave.
Fine dull cashmere and a crape cloth
made of mohair and Australian wool.
woven in form of heavy crape, are also
shown.
There is a kind of armure cloth
which makes up into very pretty
mourning gowns when developed with
all the care used in making other hand
some garments. One dress of this kind
is shown at one of the stores. The
skirt, which is just allowed to touc'i
the floor in the back. has a twelve inch
shaped flounce around the bottom.
This is a little deeper at the back and
is stiffened in the approved fashion
with a black taffeta ruffle beneath as
a protector. On the flounce is one
band of English crape four inches deep
and above that three rolls of the same
crape, as small as they can he made.
The skirt is cut in many gores, every
one of them piped down with the crape.
Where the flounce joins the skirt there
is a fiat band one inch wide. There is
a short half fitting coat to wear with
this of the same material. The revers,
cuffs and pocket lids are of the crape.
There is a vest of dull armure silk, and
this is buttoned to the chin with crape
covered buttons. The outside coat.
which is fastened to the vest, is so
made that the flat collar and revers
render some such arrangement neces
sary. Like the poor, the high collars
are always with us. The mode of fas
tening the outside coat to the vest ob
tains in many of the new spring suits.
Even widows are now allowed by
fashion to wear hats instead of uncom
fortable little bonnets. It is not un
common to see a lady with a large
flat hat made, it is true, of crape, but
tucked and puffed and ruched into
something like grace and beauty.
There are many vest effects in mourn
ing attire. Perhaps the wish to have
something a little less somber has some
thing to do with it. It is and always
was a pretty fashion. Blouse bodices
are often seen. Under those circum
stances the waist is made ornamental
with tucks and folds of crape and some
times with a little dull chenille em
broidery. A home gown for a young
widow is made of voile, set over a
taffeta slip. Around the shaped flounce
are narrow rolled bands of crap', two
at the bottom and two at the top.
Around the hips the skirt is trimmed L

with very narrow pipings. and the
blouse waist has revers of heavy Eng
lish crape and a shirred vest of the
same. The collar is a band of the voiie.
with a turndown collar of crape. Tli
collars may be of white tucked lisse or
fine mull, all white or with black
stitching. This is a matter of individ
ual taste.
In matters of mourning costume more
latitude is now allowed than some years
ago. A woman in really deep mourning
may now go. to informal dinners and
assist at semigrand functions at home
after the first three months. For such
occasions is the pretty fancy of a waist
shown here. The skirt is of some reg
ulation mourning goods, such as ar
mure silk or eudora cloth, but the waist
is made of black chiffon shirred in
lengthwise rows and garnished with
exceedingly narrow folds of crape in
clusters of three. Around the semide.
collete neck is a ruff of accordion plait
ed silk mull edged with a narrow ruche
of chiffon. Just above that is an ar
rangement of folds of crape edged with
dull jet beads. Jet ornaments in form
of light neck laces are very much liked.
The older the style is the better is it
liked.
Gloves for mourning are of suede or
glace kid. One's handkerchief may be
entirely white or embroidered black or
with a hem of black. Full gowns of
chiffon and brussels net made over silk
are the proper thing when the wearer
wishes to go to some dinner or recep
tion permitted by the ordinary conven
tionalities. Some gowns are made sim

forced to perform their own household
labor. On the whole, this is not a bad
result, for it will elevate housework.
Conditions being as they are, the no
ble scheme of Rev. L. G. Jordan, col
ored, of Philadelphia develops in the
nick of time to fill the most urgent
want in civilized domestic economy.
He has established a "school of serv
ice." He has devoted himself to his
race, he says, and fifteen years has he
been saving all the money be could to
found his school. It will be the best
work of his life, in his opinion.
All kinds of service required in a
d-mestic establishment will be taught
in Rev. Mr. Jordan's institution. All
that style and flourish which appeal so
to the fervid artistic negro imagination
will be brought to bear in the working
out of the plan. Even the large words
-which delight the Afro-American soul
will be rattled to and fro constantly.
n,'or instance, a kitchen is here not a
kitchen, but a "laboratory of cooking."
Young persons from the country, who,
perchance, know their work fairly well.
but who "lack style," will be taken up
like American singers in Paris and
licked-into shape and turned out finish
ed artists in the all important matter
of style. While cooks, housemaids.,
laundresses and seamstresses will con
stitute the bulk of those graduated
from the establishment, young men
will also be taught their perfect duties
as coachmen, butlers, valets and
grooms, likewise cooks and waiters.
One who has ever ioted a handsome
yellow coachman driving his carriage
through the park wil; ur derstand what
is meant by "style." Being a school of
service, men must be admitted to the
institution to some extent. It is agree
able to know also that white students
will not be discriminated against in
Mr. Jordan's college. but will be ad
Imitted on equal terms with colored.
Thereby 1Rev. Mr. Jordan heaps coals
of fire upon the head of the white race.
The most interesting part of the es
tablishment is naturally the "labora
tory of cooking." Everything must be
done right, from the boiling of an egg
to the making of a plum pudding.
When it is remembered how few kitch
en girls have the nice judgment even
to watch the clock and time the opera
tion of boiling an egg, the importance
of such teaching will be understood.
Again, a professor of chamber work
will stand over the student while she
smooths the snowy bed linen, which
process must be completed with a
broomstick or yardstick, and watch
her to see that every scrap of lint and
dust is removed from rug, floor and
windows and that the sleeping room Is
aired perfectly as well. It is delight
ful to think of having in one's family
a housemaid who will do hygienic
chamber work.
With laundry work it is the same.
Every piece must be turned out immac
ulate, all must be clean and orderly.
To accomplish herself in laundry work
the washerwoman to be must .ave ten
lessons, the housemaid twelve le son.s;
the perfected cook, able for fancy cok
ing and invalids' diet, must take a
course of sixty lessons.
, The good work Rev. Mir. Jordan has
here inaugurated for both black and
white people cannot be measured.
There are thousands of educated negro
women who might be teachers, clerks
and stenographers, but race rarejurdice
prevents their securing employment.
Here is sure occupation at excellent
wages for every ore who avail her
self of the instruction in Rev. L. G. Jor
dan's "school of service."
