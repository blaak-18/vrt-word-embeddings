The Troops Going.
Little Rock and Fort LeorncUortlh
their Dctinttion- The D)cnocrat's
Statement ('onfirmed.
New Orleans, June 8. -- (en.
1'eniypacker, with his Adjutant,
will leave this city this evening
for Fort Leavenworth in advance
of his regiment, the Sixteenth In
fantry, which has been ordered to
the point named.
During his stay here the Gene.
ral has made many warm friends
in the city, and his departure,
with that of his officers, will be
regretted by all with whom they
have become personally acquaint.
ed. The regiment will not leave
until the General has made all
necessary arrangements for their
summer quarters in the West.
Two of the three companies of
the Thirteenth Regiment, which
went to Baton Rouge, left there a
week ago Saturday night, for Lit
tle Rock, Arkansas, where they
will remain for the summer. In
connection with this movement of
troops, it will be remembered that
on the day after Thanksgiving the
.Iemocrat asserted that the troops
then in the city wonld be removed
to Baton Rouge, Little Rock and
Fort Leavenworth, and once more
is the Democrat's information con
firmed.
An amendment of the Virginia con
stitution, lately adopted, requires pre
payment of a capital tax to be proved
as a condition of the exercise of the
right of suffrage. The first election un
der this rule has just been held, with
somewhat remarkable results. In the
cities, the ward-caucus bummer sud
lenly disappeared from the field or po
litical activity. Having no money
wherewith to pay the tax, he had no
vote, of course, and having no vote, the
candidates had no use for him. The
property-owning people took the elec
tion business into their own hands, se
lected responsible persons of their own
class for the offices, and left the poor
devils who had been in the habit of
looking forward to ellStion-day as a
sort of improved Fourth-of-July, w'ith
unlimited free whisky thrown in, to
suffer unmitigated drouth while mourn
ing for the "go( d old times" that have
so suddenly and entirely passed away.
As might be naturally supposed, the
tax-paying people rejoice at their rid
dance of bummer sovereignty and per
suade themselves perhaps too confident
ly that that most undesirable system
will never be re enthroned. There is
this disadvantage about the new system
-and all interested will quickly find it
out-that whenever offices are at stake
of sufficient importance to justify a con
siderable outlay of money, it will be
possible for candidates to pay taxes for
the bummers in order to secure their
votes, and in such cases success will be
apt to depend chiefly if not entirely up
on the length of the purses opposing as
pirants may have available for this spe
cies of corruption. The elimiuation of
non-taxpayers from the voting class is
an excellent thing, but if the improve
meant is to be permanent, it will have to
lo put beyond th9 reach of so cheap a
device as the manufacture of voters at a
dollar or twou per caIpit.
