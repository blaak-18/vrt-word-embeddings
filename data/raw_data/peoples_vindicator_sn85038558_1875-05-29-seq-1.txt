Q. That was before last June ?
A. Yes.
Q. Was that feeling pretty general en
in the Parish ? TI
A. I think so, except out in the th
country and in iet don't venture out He
in the country. fll
Q. To what do you attribute this in
very sudden change in the feelings wI
and relations between the races ? th
A. I just think that the White wi
League were playing a political trick M
to get control, ansd if they failed one IH
way they would get it another. They be
said that openly. TI
Q. Was that on account of any al- th
leged grievances they had ou account cc
of any mismanagement of affairs t d!
A. They alleged it so; but they V
could not allege that; it did not come fo
from the Republicans. P.
Q. When did the Republicans first H
get control of the parish I
In 1868. th
Q. How long did they retain con- to
trol t Ie
A. Up to 1872, in December, 1872, te
all the officers claimed to have been at
elected by the McEnery or Walsh If
Board and went and took the offices. I
The Sheriff is a Democrat, the Re- pl
corder is a Democrat; and there was SI
a majority of Democrats in office in th
1873 and in 1874; there were three th
Democrats put off the Board. th
Q. When was the rate of taxation Ir
highest I he
A. In 1874, I think. p1
What is the amount of the indebt- T
eduess of the parish ? bi
t A. I could not give you that in YS
figures.
i Q. Can you give us an estimate of a`
I it? h,
A. I guess I have a paper in my ac
pocket that I could refer to. M
Q. You don't know the amount of H
r the indebtedness di
1 A. I could not give it to you now. tr
Q. Do you know the amount of the th
indebtedness of the parish before '68 ? sip
' A. I think is was about twenty-tire m
thousand and some hundred dollars. bJ
f Q. What is the highest rate of tax- W'
ation before 1868 ? cs
A. I could not give that. I never w
did trouble myself about the parish cc
debt. If I was summoned as a wit- us
t noe, I never even asked for my scrip. cd
Q. You cannot give these figures do
then ? t
A. Icould not. hi
Q. How many pounds 4o you put in
in a bale of cotton ? hi
1 A. As a general thing they put five eh
hundred or five hundred and fifty tl
1 pounds in a bale ; and some as low as lib
four hundred and four hundred and o0
e fifty. di
Q. They average about tivehundred he
- poundst
A. Yes, I guess so.
t Q What is the worth of a pound
in that parish t
e A. At this time, I think, about fif
teen or sixteen cents. I have known i
it down as low as twelve and a half
cents.
SQ. Now, if the colored people ware o
usually laboring there on shares al hi
it is the general practice to swindle It
them out of the result of their labor, di
how do you account for the fact that
the colored people are getting along a*
better than the white people ? w t
A. There are colored people who
have been able to rent places; they i
hiteo rented lands and have taken
others witl them and have made good
crops. They got what they did in
IBhat way and have accumulated t
means in that way. A ood many of
Sthem have homes of their own,
Q. How did they first accumulate
0 means to acquire those homes ?
A. In various ways'; some were
Ssmarter than others and started cou
ight lafter the sarrender and as they ,
gote on they lifted others by hiring
them and pying them for what they
worked.
SQ. Are not the tsy-playgs, black
o and white, complaining of High tar

A Man Who Catches Cannon- Ft
balls in His Hands.
(Paris Letter to the N. O. Times.]
A very singular exhibition was giv
en yesterday at the Jardin Mabille. thi
There has been performing hero at its
the Folies JBergeres a man named
Holtum, an American, who has a can- br
non fired at him and catches the ball br
in his hands. This prodigious feat fal
was witnessed nightly, and, a although wi
theactols present avowed that there an
was no trick, Pierre Veron, of the an
Monde Illustre, would not believe it. an
He said that the canuon-ball must ap
be thrown to !iultum from tihe stage. di
The latter miade a bet of 5,000 francs (hi
that he would perform the feat under as,
conditions which left no room to gel
doubt, and, when the bet was taken, col
Veron designated Mahille as the place cal
for the trial. All the journalists of thi
Paris were invited, and they found ac
Holtunt there before his cannon. It TI
was examined with minute care, and Co
the heavy ball was passed from hand if
to hand. "I am no longer in my own en
house," said Holtum; "you are Imas- we
ter here, and you must watch over ho
all the arrageiments." Having cave thi
I fully aimed and lashed his ca:uon, it nit
was charged, and Ilolttun took his an
place against a plank'target some ten
yards away. This was to show that tel
t the ball was solid, and the force of pil
the puowder great nuough to send it til
through the plank. Holtuim got the tlhe
i aim of his gun, and then placed his de
head in a certain position against the acs
plank, giving the command to fire. tll
The ball just grazed the hair and to
broke the plank, rolling sonie twenty Ilh
a yards further on. The same ball io
was picked up by the journalists, who pe
f again charged the cannon and sent
home the ball, and this time Holtuin ac
r caught the ball in his hands as neatly rai
as he does nightly upon the stage. ed
r He won his bet, and no one seemed
disposed to accept his offr of 3,000 fri
trance to any one who would perform co
the same astonishing feat. The phy-. fii
º sical force required. must be enor- dii
,mons, but foltum showed his strength ne
by tossing up cannon-balls as if they rit
were so many oranges. The only pre- in,
cautions taken are very simple; he po
r wears very thick, leather gloves, and pi
covers his breast with many thick- wi
nesses of thin paper to form a sort of be
ceirasse. This looks to nme like a very w!
dangerous teat, and particularly the fei
first part of it, where Holtum places
his head against the target half aul th
inch below where the ball will proba- of
bly strike. If the powder should in
Schance to be defective, some day be
1 there might be an accident. It is Al
a like the foolhardy trick of putting of
I one's head into a lion's mouth. One at
day I fancy that ball will snap his all
I head very nearly off. w

Mr. J. Harris, one of the best sit
thorities, thus discourses upon tfhis
important subject:
What do we mean by an improved
breed 6f pigs ? Usually we mean :.
breed that has fine bone and little of
fal. A breed that is very quiet aunt
will turn the food it eats into flesh
and fat. It is a breed that will eat
and digest a stomach full of rich foodt
and assimilate it. As a rule the weak
spot in all high bred pigs is thait their
digestive powers are not as good as
their assimilating powers. They can
assimilate more food than they di
gest. On the other hand, our con
common, course, unimproved hogs
can usually oat and digest more food
than they can assimilate. They are
accustomed to forage for themselves.
They have plenty of exercise and
comparatively little food. Now then.
if you take such a breed of hogs and
endeavor to push them rapidly for
ward with rich food, it is easy to see
how their blood could be poisoned by
the excess of material whichi the ani
mual is not able to convert into flesh
antd fat.
My remedy would he to raise a bet
ter class of pigs. I would raise such
pigs as would stand high feeding un
til they were fat enough to sell and
then I would dispose of then without
delay. If you take pigs that are not
accustomed to mature before they are
three' or four years old and endeavor
to so feed and force thlem that they
shall be ready for market at twelve
months old or less, what can you ex
pect but hog cholera.
On the other bhad, a bleed that is
accustomed, and has been for gene
rations to mature early, can be push
ed forward rapidly without injury.
I should expect the best success
fromn pigs raised from a large, healthy,
t common sow, sired by a highly re
fined thoroughbred boar, as a breed
distinguished for its gentlenem, fine
ness of buone, little offal, early matu
rity, and fattening qualities.: The
.mother would furnish the digestive
powers and the sire the assimilating
powers. These qualities eombined
with an early maturity, flaueesa of
F bone, and high qualities of meat,
woul4 give you precisely what a good
feeder wants.
A simple method of determining
the quantity of cream in any seantle
of milk consists in agitating the milk
in a graduated glass tube with its
bulk of either for four or five minutes.
Add alcohol in volume equal to that
of the milk, and shake for five min
utes. Place the tube vertically and
' allow it to rest for a brief period,
when the oily matter will rise to the
surfaee so that its amoant may be
read off on the scale and'the percenat
age easily computed.
