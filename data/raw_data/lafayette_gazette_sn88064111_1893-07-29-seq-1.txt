ne is lovely Jast to look at,
With his thoughtful, dark brown eyes
Bli gentle taed and shining ourls-.
But he isn't very wise.
Two birthdays he has counted,
Two dimples he can show;
Yet he's ignorant of many things
That little babies know.
Though lh talks in childish fashion,
He knows but pretty words,
And he says them in a voice as sweet
As the cooing of the birds
He smiles at everybody,
But he hasn't learned to fret;
And angry looks and pouts-
He doesn't know them yet
Oh. overything contents him.
So he's never learned to tease:
Aad kicks and screams-he's unaware
There are such things as these.
But he's lovely just to look at
And to cuddle and to pet,
For to wriggle out of loving arms,
He hasn't learned it yet.
Oh, as at first I told you,
He isn't very wise;
Yet were we all as ignorant,
Earth might be Paradise.

after he had
quarreled with
his wife for
half an hour

fast table-"it

me we are quite

Blummer, wip
ing the tears of
---- anger from her
pretty brown eyes. "We are not at all
congenial !"
"On this point," observed Blummer,
icily, "we seemt to have no difference of
opinion. We were utterly mistaken
in ever imagining we cared for each
other enough to-"
"You are right," the little woman
broke in, determined he should not gain
the least advantage. "It was very silly
of me, and I shall never cease to re
gret it."
"I made a blooming idiot of myself,"
Blummer brutally declared. "But, then,
you were a rather pretty and stylish
girl when I met you at-"
"Oh, you are really growing compli
mentary! So I was a rather pretty and
stylish girl-when you met me! That
Was just one year ago. I suppose I
have grown old and homely and dowdy
in a year! If so, the life I have led
with you during the last six months is
the cause of it!"
She was growing hysterical again.
"I have done all I could to malke you
happy, but you are the most unreason
able woman I ever saw. I thought you
an angel, but I have found you possess
a temper-like-like-a cold chisel. Our
married life has been a wretched fail
ire!"
Then :xe very deliberately attempted
to take a drink of coffee from his egg
glass.
"'There is a remedy for our wretcheA
ness!" exclaimed the little woman, de
cidedly, a look of resolution on her
flushed face.
"Yes," he nodded. "The remedy is
separation. It would be a glorious thing
to be a free man again."
She leaped to her feet.
"That settles it. Mr. Btlummer! I'll
not live another day with you after
"TaHE REMIEDY IS SEPARATION.'
this! 1 shall enjoy my freedom quite
as much as you will. The only thing I
dread is the horrible disgrace of being
seen in a divorce court."
"You need not worry about that, Mrs.
B2lummer, unless you wish to marry
again, for we can live apart by mutual
consent and there need be no divorce.
As for me, I shall never marry again."
"Nor I. Once is enough for me! We
will separate quietly."
She sat down again and they talked
it over, finally arriving at an agree
ment.
II.
SMrs. Blummer went away to a re
mote little resort amid the mountains,
where she could spend a q et summer.
She stopped at a picturesque old hotel,
where she was known as a widow, as
it happened she affeeted black. And a
very gay little widow s'he made, for she
was determined to obtain utter forget
fulness in the pleasure to be extracted
from the passing moment.
And so it canme about that she made
the acquaintance of a "perfectly lovely"
old doctor who took a great interest in
her. He was so very kind and attentive
that he seemed like a father to her.
Day after day Mrs. Blummer and the
doctor were seen together, and it was
not long before the other guests began
to gossip mildly about them.
"She is awfully lucky," declared one
gushing young thing. "He is really in
earnest, and he's so awfully rich! No
sensible girl would mind his age', for
he's awfully handsome. But it's al
ways the widows who make thle lucky
catcham"
One day the doctor and Mrs. Blummer
were alone in a cozy little nook beside
he mountain stream, where they had
come for the ostensible purpose of fish
ing. But their rods lay idly on the
ground, and they were seated quite near
together on the soft moss.
"Mrs. Blummer," said the doctor, se
curing one of her hands, "I love you,
and I want you to marry me. I am a
wealthy man, and I will do everything
in my power to make you happy."
Her tender brown eyes filled with
tears, and she tried to release her hand.
"Doctor, I cannot marry you."
"Why not?"
"I am married already."
Then she told him everything in a
frank way that made him feel that he
loved her all the more desperately.
When she had finished, he said:
"You do noClove this man to whom
you are bound?"
"No. "
"Would you marry me if you were
free?"
"I-I think so."
"Then you must obtain a legal sepa
ration from him."
IIL
Three hundred miles away, Blur..mer
was enjoying himself at the seanaore.
He met a very charming and beautiful
girl, and, by way of diversion, he
sought her society as much as possible.
Onoday he came to the conclusion that
he was really and truly in love with
her.
From that moment Blummer grew
rapidly desperate, after the manner of
any man who knows his affection is
reciprocated yet feels that the situation
is hopeless.
One night, as they sat on a huge
bowlder and watched the glory of the
moonlight on the rippling ocean, he
told her how much he loved her, and
heard her sweet voice confess a mutual
attachment.
Then came the task of revealing the
truth, which he did in a manly manner.
Of course she was shocked and dis
tressed, but she acknowledged she loved
him still.
"Would I were a free man!" he cried.
"I can be in a short time," he added, a
sudden thought coming to him. "My
wife will not oppose a separation. Will
you wait for me and marry me then?"
"Yes, dear."
Blummer felt himself the happiest
man on earth.
IV.
Mr. and Mrs. Blummer met by ap
pointment, They greeted each other
coldly.
"Henry." spoke the little woman.
TIIHEY GREETED EACHI OTHER COLDLY.
after some moments of hesitation, "I
have come to ask a favofof you."
"And I have come to ask one of you,"
he said.
"I want you to allow me to obtain a
legal separation from you."
"*Why, that is the very thing I was
going to ask of you. I am willing to
give you the necessary grounds, and
we can take the case to South Dakota.
Everything shall be done as quietly as
possible."
Both seemed delighted, and still they
eyed each other a trifle suspiciously, as
if scenting the truth.
"Why do you wish a separation,
Edna?" he finally asked. "I trust you
are not contemplating another mar
riage as soon as this? I believe you
said once was enough for you."
She tossed her head defiantly.
"I have no reason to conceal the
truth," she replied. "I am contem
plating another marriage. I have
found an ideal man, and he will make
me his wife as soon as proper after the
separation."
Blummer felt a twinge of pained sur
prise, and he fancied his wife had never
seemed quite so handsome before.
"I am also going to get married," he
acknowledged, finding pleasure in his
ability to say so. "I am engaged to a
most charming girl who I am confident
will make a model wife."
He had arisen, and she sprang to her
feet and confronted him, her chin quiv.
ering. For some moments they stood
looking into each other's eyes, a strange
feeling creeping over them.
"Henry Blummer!" she finally sobbed,
"you are a brute! I-I did th-think you
would have more regard for me than
this. If you marry again I'll kill my
self!"
Deap little soul! How Blummer
longed to take her in his arms andreon
sole her!
"But you are going to get married,"
he protested.
"No, I am not!" she quickly asserted.
"I did think of it, but I've changed my
mind now. You don't love me a bit,
and I am ready to die!"
He couldn't resist longer, so he caught
her close to his breast, and she sobbed
on his shoulder, making no attempt to
get away.
"•dna," he murmured, his mustache
close to her shapely little ear; "we
have been deceiving ourselves. We
care more for each other than for all
the rest of the world! We ought to
live happily together. Let's try it over
again, little wife."
"I am willing, dear."
She lifted her smiling, tear-stpineo
face, and he cissed her dainty mo ,lh.

THEY .HEARD A NOISE.
The Girls Thought a Barglas Had Come
and Prepared for a Vallant Defense.
They were brushing out their hair
before retiring and having a good talk
at the same time.
"What would you do if a burglar got
into your room at night?" asked the
girl with the dreamy eyes.
"Why, scream, of course," responded
the matter-of-fact girl.
"Order him to leave;" said the girl
with the haughty nose.
"Call papa," said the girl with the
dimple in her chin.
"Attack him at once." remarked the
girl who belonged to an athletic club.
"But suppose nobody could hear you
scream, and he wouldn't go if you told
him, and papa wasn't anywhere near,
and there was nothing with which to
attack him?"
"But I always keep a revolver by my
bedside," interrupted the girl who be
longed to an amateur athletic club.
"0, Maame, is it here? I-I won't
sleep with you if you have that horrid
thing in the room."
"It couldn't' go off by itself. you
know," put in the matter-of-fact girl.
"'If papa didn't come I'd give him all
my jewelry and then beg him to go,"
observed the girl with the dimple in
her chin.
- "I wouldn't; I always hide mine in
the soap dish, and--"
"1 wrap mine in a pair of stockings
and throw it under the bed."
"I tie mine up in the bundle of old
letters where-"
"Mline is always in the pocket of a
dress hanging up in the wardrobe; it's
safe."
'G(;irls! Did you hear a noise?"
"Nonsense, it is only dear little rido
--he always sleeps on the foot of my
bed, and-w-hy, he isn't there! Girls, I
do hear a noise!"
"It is only the wind rising," remarked
the matter-of-fact girl. "Of course you
locked the door?"
"I-O! I don't known!"
"Where-where is my revolver?"
asked the girl who belonged to the
athletic club.
"Don't---don't point it this way,"
begged the girl with the haughty nose,
"your hand shakes so that it points all
ways at once."
"Who-who is there?" quavered the
girl with the dimple in her chin.
No reply.
"0, girls, do you think it is really a
burglar? And Harry wants his ring
back, too; what if it should be stolen
now, he'd never-"
"Is-is there a-a poker in the room?"
queried the girl with the dreamy eyes,
in tremulous tones.
"There it is again; u. I

little Fido trying to get in. Come in

DELICATE CHILDREN.
Outdoor Exercise MIore Beneficial Than
Medicine.
A wise old physician once said, frank
ly: "Much more depends upon the nurse
than the physician. Ve see the patient
but once a day, and a poor nurse can
easily undo all the good our medicine
does." It is upon the continual care
and watchfulness that a good nurse
exercises that the mother nlust depend
in rearing a delicate child, rather than
upon doctors' drugs and lotions. Sys
tematic outdoor exercise, but never to
the point of fatigue, will do more to
ward building up the strength than!
all the tonics. This does not mean that
the tonic is not also vhluable, but the
individual who depends on tonics alone,
without proper hygienic care in the
surrounding of the invalid, is likely to
be disappointed in the result.
The inability to sleep on the part of
some nervous sufferers Is often due to
close air. When the sick one is too ill
to go out in the open air. but can be
moved, it is best to have two rooms,
one for use at night and one during the
day. Both, should be plentifully sup
plied with fresh air, and the room
in use during the day should be
bright and sunny, with ah open
fire burning on the hearth and!
blooming flowers in the windows.
These matters may seem small, though
the open fire-place is insisted upon by
the best English physicians, for the pur
pose of keeping the air of the room
pure, as well as making the r6onio eer
fuil. It is not enough for an invalid
that his table be supplied with whole
some. suitable food, and his room kept
warm. The food must look tempting.
The room must look cheerful. There
must be an atmosphere of rest about
the room that will be soothing to the
nerves. The light must be graduated
so that it is neither glaring nor gloomy.
The ornaments about the room must
be occasionally changed, so that the
restless invalid may have something
new to take up his attention and di
vert his thoughts from himself. Still
it is foolish to make too many changes
or disturb the restful quiet of the room.
A nurse should be a person of strong
nerve, but one sensible and intelligent
enough to appreciate and soothe the
abnormally sensitive nerves of the con
valescent. It is upon such care that
the success of nurses' work depends, as
well as upon perfect system in the rou
tine performance of their duties.--N.
Y. Tribune.
wIm Find Use For It.
"Why don't you retire from business,
father?" said the rich man's only son.
"Y'ou have accumulated more money
now than I need, and more than I shall
ever be able to spend."
"Not so, my boy," answered the man
of wealth. "'Suppose you should enter
politics some dlay. Suppose you should
be called on to serve your country as
United States nminister at some foreign
court!"
And with a heavy sigh the proud, amn
bitious father turned again to his ac
counts.-Chicago Tribune.
REPUBLICAN REORGANIZATION.
The Badly UVuettled Condition of the
G. O.P.
Since the November election of 1892
the republicans have been in a some
what dazed condition, and their efforts
to pull themselves together and to get
their bearings have not been crowned
with any very brilliant success. They
appear to be at one in the opinion that
something ought to be done; but what
to do and how to do it, are points with
reference to which there is a lamen
table difference of opini )n.
There is a widespread impression that
the republican party mr.st turn over a
new leaf. But; in order to determine
what to do, it is thought necessary to
decide where it has erred in the past.
In order properly to treat the wound, it
is desirable to know what hit it. A
case is recorded where a physician mis
took the peck of a hen for the bite of a
rattlesnake, and thereb 1 brought him
self and his art into ridicule. But, after
all, the blunder was safer than the op
posite one of mistaking the injection of
a deadly poison into the veins for a
wnre scratch.
Republicans find among themselves a
singular difference of opinion. They
cannot agree whether their party has
been too virtuous or too vile for the pop
ular taste. In view of the history of
the party this difference is quite unac
countable, but there is abundant evi
dence of its existence. To do the lead
ers justice, they are willing to seem
either better or worse if they can win
votes by it. A candidate for a certifi
cate as teacher of a public school, when
asked whether he believed the earth to
be round or fiat, not feeling sure of his
ground, avowed his will ingness to teach
either round or flat, as the trustees
might direct. In like manner the re
publican leaders would be ready either
to seem virtuous, or to espouse vice, if
they could only decide which course
would bring them the greater number
of votes.
Mr. Clarkson, it will be remembered,
has steadily held to the theory that
the republican party is too good for an
unregenerate world. Its austere moral
ity, its intolerance of cakes and ale. in
his opinion, repel all but the few that
love the straight and narrow road, and
leave it in the minority. There are
others, however, who are of a very dif
ferent opinion. These last are aware
that it has mixed greed in heroic doses
with homeopathic measures of godli
ness, has paraded hypocrisy for holi
ness, has cultivated corruption, con
doned crime, and in many ways pro
voked the wrath of the people which
fell upon it so unsparingly. This ele
ment believe that the only thing to do
now is to reform, or, at least, to assume
a virtue if they have it not. They
wish to see the party aspire to a higher
plane by putting forward better can
didates, and ignoring the ways of ma
chine politicians. In this way they
hope to purchase a return of popular
favor.
Of this class is the republican club of
Massachusetts, which has just sent out
a remarkable circular, from which the
following is an extract:
"By taking part in your caucuses, and thus
attending to your duty as citizens, you will
also do much to insure the triumph of your
principles and the election of your candidates
at the polls, for there are many in this common
wealth who are at present but little bound by
party ties in state affairs, and who will vote
only for candidates whom they know to he of
high character and without reproach, and who,
having been nominated by the people. are in
touch with them and have no promises to re
deem to individuals for political services."
The reorganization of the republican
party is doubtless necessary, but how
is it to be accomplished while such dif
ferences of opinion exist among its
members? If the virtuous people of the
republican club of Massachusetts suc
ceed in nominating a candidate who has
"no promises to redeem to individuals,"
how are those individuals who make
such promises a condition of their sup
port to be -'placated?" Questions such
as this make the task of reorganizing
the party for future conflicts one of
much difllculty. - Louisville Courier
Journal.
"CALICO CHARLIE'S" FAILURE.
A Strong Arraignment of the Late Repub
lican Treasurer.
The failure of a bank owned and
managed by "Calico Charlie" Foster,
ex-secretary of the treasury, surprises
no one.
Why should it?
Why should a man who made in the
conduct of the United States treasury
the momentous and disastrous blunders
fIrom which the country is now suffer
ing, anti must continue to suffer for
many years to come, be able to carry
on his own affairs with any distin
guished success? Foster ran the United
States treasury as if it were a gambling
establishment. He lay awake at night
devising schemes for squandering the
public money, and the present stress of
the national treasury, consequent from
the continuous exportation of gold, is
entirely due to his policy.
Under Foster's regime such wanton
legislation as the MlcKinley bill, the
Sherman silveract and the unspeakable
corruptions of the pension bureau had
an easy time of it. Anything like
order, economy, mere decency in the
public expenditures, was apparently
beyond "CalicoCharlie's" ken. He was
perhaps the most incompetent and
most ignorant official that ever held
the ofice dignified by such men as Alex
ander Hamilton, Hugh McCullough and
William WVindom.
It seems to be expected that public
prints should express the sorrow of
their owners and editors for the mis
fortune that has come upon Foster. As
personally he may be a very good man,
we have no hesitancy in adding our
voice to this inane chorusof sympathy;
but that does not moderate our opinion
that Foster was an utterly vicious
ofclal, who probably conducted his
own financial affairs with as little abil
ity and prudence as he did those of the
nation.--lllustrated American.

CLEVELAND'S FOREIGN POLICY.
The Demoeratle Admlnlstratlon orktag
on Jefersonian Principles.
The latest reports from Hawaii show
that Mr. Cleveland is still carrying out
his thoroughly American and thorough
ly democratic policy of non-interven
tion in the domestic affairs of our
weaker neighbors. Mr. Blount has
given the provisional government to
understand that American newspaper
correspondents in Honolulu must not
be arrested and punished for what ap
pears in American newspapers, but he
has taken no part in the controversy
on the .islands and is doing nothing
whatever to promote the trouble,
which, as is now well known, was
originaLly due to the intrigues of per
sons connected with the Harrison ad
ministration.
The autonomy of these islands will
be maintained. They will remain in
dependent of foreign control. We will
not annex them, nor will we declare a
protectorate. It will be enough simply
to have it understood, as it is well un
derstood now by the whole world, that
the Monroe doctrine applies to them.
Mr. Cleveland's foreign policy is in
every respect admirable. He has op
posed himself to the policy of en
tangling alliances and intrigues which
under llarrison threatened the coun
try with the gravest dangers. Had
we gone on for another year without a
change of this policy, we would have
almost certainly had a foreign war of
conquest and rapine, in which, to our
lasting disgrace and to the final over
throw of democracy. we would have in
vaded and subjugated some one of our
weaker neighbors.
In opposing himself to this Mr.
Cleveland represents the democracy of
Thomas Jefferson---of government by
consent of the governed; of opposition
to subjugation; of helpfulness and
neighborliness instead of rapacity and
violence.
We have a country so large already
that any further acquisition of terri
tory would be in every respect a disad
vantage. If we acquire more territory,
we must sooner or later abandon the
republican form of government. It in
not suitable for an empire, and we can
not make it so. What do any of us
know of the condition of our subjects
in Alaska? We know that they are our
subjects-more the slaves of-the federal
government than if they were personal
chattels. We hear from time to time
that whole villages of them are carried
off by starvation, and we know in a
general way that all this country cares
about in Alaska is what money can be
got out of the mines and fisheries. But
beyond this we know nothing and care
nothing of these people for whom we
are morally responsible since we have
bought them as slaves in buying their
country without their consent. But
who will say that our form of govern
ment is suitable for them? And if it is
not, who can deny that it was a crime
for us to buy them as it is a crime to
hold them in subjection?
As the country becomes more im
perial in extent it becomes more diffi
cult to maintain local self-government.
Our territory already extends from
ocean to ocean, and already in the
course of its first century we have been
obliged to fight a civil war which came
near costing us the abandonment of
the principle of consent and the restora
tion of the old barbaric rule of force.
What folly, then, would it be to enter
deliberately on a policy of subjugating
new territory when it is certain that in
so doing we would forfeit our own lib
erties.
Mr. Cleveland deserves the thanks of
every patriotic American for what he
has done to save the country from the
great danger that threatened it-the
danger of rejecting the demnocratic
principle, of finally abandoning the re
publican form and of rushing headlong
into a policy of imperialism.-St. Louis
Republic.

FARM AND GARDEN. I
THE ROAD QUESTION.
An Agrlcultural Paper on the Financial
Aspect of the 3Movement.
The demand for better roads has
come to stay, but roads can't be built
without money. How to procure the
money is the main question. It must
be obtained in some way so that the
burden of building does not fall at
once upon those wvhose, farms are to be
benefited. The farmers are not able
to bear such a burden in the beginning.
If in some proper way the expense of
making the roads could fall on the
farms to be benefited in the next ten,
twenty, or thirty years, the farms
would be so increased in value that
that very increase would pay the ex
pense many times over.
We can see no way of building such
roads as ought to be made, such roads
as we have seen in England, France
and Germany, that have stood for a
thousand years, and are as good as
when first made, except by forming in
some manner road districts and issuing
bonds by those road districts, and lay
VIEW OF COtN'TRY ROAD TAKEN MAIRCH
24, 1893.
Ing such a system of taxation on the
farms to be benefited as will eventual
ly pay the bonds. Some such system
can be devised that will make the
bonds safe as an investment, that can
be readily sold. and tihe money there
that will more than double the value of
the farms on or near which the roel
passes.
The chief trouble in the way is that
there is always a class of adventurers
and speculators who will cont"-act to
build the roads and expect to make
fortunes out of the job, but each com
munity or district must look out for
and protect itself. If anything goes
wrong on their road they are the suf
ferers. and they should see to it that
the roads are honetly and properly
made at as little cost as possible.
It really is not right for the state or
county to be taxed for building roads
that benefit some farms perhaps a hun
dred per cent. or more. while hundreds
of other farms are not touched or ben
efited in the least. Those farms that
receive the benefit should pay therefor,
and only those, hence the importance
of establishing road districts and hav
ing special taxation for them to build
their own roads.. The advantages of
good roads are so obvious that no time

them, how to raise the money to build
them, and put proper safeguards
around them so that the work shall be

TWO BUTTERMAKERS.
Why One aliled sand wll time Otlier (Irce
r'rosperottus.
"What did you get for your butter to
day?" asked one farmer of another.
"I got :10 cents a pound," replied the
other.
"WVhat! 30 cents a pound:'
"That is what I said."
"Why! I only got 18 cents for mnine.
How did you muanamge it."
"I saw a lman's name reported in :rn
article descriptive of a society event. I
got a friend in the city to look up his
address in the directory anti then sent
him a pound of my b,utter. At the same
time I wrote him giving; him my refer
cnces, describing my process of mak
ing the butter and laying special stress
upon the cleanly manner in which all
my dairying operations were being con
ducted. and I expressed the hope that
if he and his family liked the butter I
should be pleased to forward him a
regular weekly supply guaranteed to be
equal to the sample. I did not have to
wait long before I heard from him. lie
wrote: Will take 29 pounds weekly till
further orders at 30o cents the year
round. Must he equal to sample.'
Since then other orders have come in
from his acquaintances, and I simply
can't meet the demand."
The farmer addressed was greatly
surprised, but in speaking of the inci
dent to the writer a short time ago the
progressive dairyman remarked that he
was as wvell satisfied as if he had never
explained the matter, that his casual
acquaintance would continue to do
business at the old stand just the same
as he had been doing for years. Sulch
men are insensible to either improve
ment or enterprise. -l)Dairy World.
HORTICULTURAL NOTES.
THE soil that is worked thoroughly
before potatoes are planted is the soil
that will produce the best possible crop
that such soil can produce.
Arrr.LY the wood ashes to the potato
crop after planting, sowing broadcast
at the rate of 600 pounds per acre. All
root crops are benefited by ashes.
VARIETIES Of mangel Wurtzel that
have a large number of fine roots are
not as good as those that are free of
such roots. They do not keep as well.
The orange globe is a good variety.
O-E pound of paris green to 800
pounds of water, with about 15 pounds
of soft soap, is good for spraying for the
codling moth. It should be used ser
eral times sabout fifteen days apart.
THe Oregon agRricultnral experiment
station advlises wrapping trees with
burlap as well as spraying them for the
codling moth. Every five or six days
the wrapping is removed and the larvi
found; beneath killed.--karmcrs' Voic,
PACKING OF PEARS.
Lessons to Be Learned from the WerIleae
turists of California.
In a paper on pears, read .by' J;.J.
Black before the Peninsular (Del.)
I Horticultural society, the essayist said:
S"1We believe that pears should be
packed in new bright packages, half
barrels, quarter barrels, baskets,crates,
down to very small packages. We
must take lessons from the California
growers. The day has gone by when
we can shovel fruit of any kind into
five-eighths baskets with a corn shovel
and then expect the business to pay. In
an average season it would be better
that never a pear in the nature of a
cull went to market Feed such to'
hogs and you save freight and then
commission, and avoid breaking down
the market for good fruit. If a glut
comes keep even your primes at home.
It is suicidal to break the market; avoid
it at any risk.
"Devote time to the marketing of
pears. Wrap each pear in tissue paper
and pack in layer boxes. Then you
won't bother with your inferior speci
mens. You will please the eye of the
dealer and consumer and never over
stock the market. Why is California
fruit looked upon as choice in the mar
ket? We all know it is not from its
flavor. The fruit of the Delaware and
Chesapeake peninsula probably excels
in flavor the fruit of any other part of
the world, and this advantage should
work a fortune to our growers. The
California fruit is looked upon in the
market as choice simply because the
specimens are all choice specimens.
wrapped in tissue paper and packed in
layer boxes generally, and are pleasing
to every sense except taste. Peninsula
fruit is pleasing to all our senses, pro
vided we handle it properly. This
proper handling means the discarding
in seasons of scarcity of probably one
fifth of the crop, and in seasons of
plenty one-third should go to the hogs.
Such a; course, honestly carried out by
the growers. will rehabilitate our fruit
business; indeed, at present it is one of
the great things lacking to general
prosperity."
BARREL ON WHEELS.
A Simple Apparatus That Will Do a Great
Amount of Work.
It is a hard task to carry water for a
hand sprayer. To rig a barrel on
wheels is no easy job without a deal of
blacksmith work, and then the heavy
casks of water will soon prove too
much for the wheels unless they are
new ones. Again, nobody can afford to
make a horse of himself by hauling too
much at a load. But a pair of old
wheels on an old axle can be run over
half of an old cider cask, this can be
swung upon the axle by bale wire pass
ing under it and a handy thing s quick
ly fixed without cost. This apparatus
will do a marvelous amount of work.
too. The pump can be hooked to a sta
ple in the bottom of the tub, or to a
platform screwed to its top or to the
handles. A disk made of boards
cleated, and fitting the top of the tub
loosely under the axle, will keep the
water from slopping badly if it is al
lowed to float in it. Held in place
above, the water will gather force while
being shakten up. and break loose and
spill at every open space.-Farm Jour

BREEDING GOOD DOGS.
Stop the l'ropagation of rongrels on the
Farm Without Delay.
Much is being said about high breed
ing, scientific breeding. the propriety
of breeding out the scrub and of thus
improving all domesti-ated stock; and
this has been going on more or less for
more than a century and resulted in the
blooded horses, cattle, sheep, swine,
poultry, fruit trees and shrubs, garden
vegetables and flowers and field seeds
ats we have them to-day; but in one re
spect little of anything has been done
to advantage. We refer to the matter
of improving the breeds of dogs and of
tmaking scrub dogs odious by populariz
ing the breeding, the scientific breed
ing. of good dogs. From the days away
back, the memory of which no man re
calls, the mean, night prowling wolfish
cur, unbred, untaught and unfed, has
been denounced as the meanest thief
known to civilization. He was ever a
mongrel, a mean, vile, vicious, ungov
ernable brute, of little or no use to his
owner, and a source of annoyance and
destruction to the neighbors and hi.
property.
Can we not popularize the breeding
of good dogs and by so doing weed out
and measurably annihilate the mongrel?
A good dog is a thing of utility, some
thing to be proud of and of great value
to his owner for both-offense andde
fcnse.-Colman's Rural World.
The Effects of Lime.
The effects of lime in the soil are
then, first, to supply the demands of
the crop: second, it has the effects by a
chemical action well known and under
stood, to dissolve other minerals in the
soil existing in an insoluble condition,
as potash and phosphoric acid, and thus
make these available as plant food;
third, it exerts another effect on the
organic matter in the soil by decompos
ing it and developing the nitrogen in it
and forming compounds with this ele
ment of plant food, and thus makebsthi
inert organic matter available for the
use of the crops; fourth, it has a me
chanical effect in making the soil mors
open in texture when the land is clay
and impervious to azr and moisture and
more compact and less porous when
it is sandy and too pervious 4to moin
