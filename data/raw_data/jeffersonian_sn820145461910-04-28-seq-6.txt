friends, whose deaths occurred within short
periods of each other, the gifted, genial, kind

would —painlessly and surrounded by his im
mediate family and the friends dearest to
him.
In all his long life, the name of Samuel
Clemens has never been connected with
scandal nor questionable business meth
ods.
Honest, earnest, believing man’s duty
to man was always to help, he had filled
a peculiar niche in the world of letters.
The popularity of his works has been
continued throughout his career as a
writer. This is an honor seldom ac
corded an author, and was the source
of keenest gratification to him.
Genial, kindly, his memory will be
treasured by those who knew him, and
many who benefited by his generosity
will miss the beneficence which had so
often made smooth their path of ad
versity. “Requiescat in pace.”

or water rights could be
controlled by only a few. His name
was Pinchot. He was a good man on
the job, too: loved his work, and was
rich enough not to have to worry about
his salary.

but they had been given it at a regular
rainy-day bargain price.
Mr. Pinchot objected and was told to
mind some more of his business and let
this little realty deed alone.
Naturally, he objected, and carried
his case to the President of the United
States.
Was lie greeted with “Well done,
thou good and faithful servant, here's
a raise for you?” Not much. He was
fired ; he was told that there is such a thing as
being too good a workman, and his forests
knew him no more.
And some investigations began which made
most interesting reading.
Ballinger, the man who made the deal, was
exonerated by the President; another man
named Glavis, who also told more than was
wanted, also got the twenty-three sign.
And now it is stated from Washington
that the investigation into the condition of
affairs in the Forestry Department could not
be made public because it went too near the
throne.
The charge is openly made that President
Taft was in collusion with Ballinger; that he
knew Pinchot’s charges were true, and it
would seem as though Washington was going
to gasp some more when the full scope of
President Taft’s knowledge of Ballinger’s
methods is made known.

on paper, with not a bale of cotton to back them
up, is going to result in wholesale failures.
And then, when millions of dollars have
been irretrievably lost, when the dozens of
suicides which always'follow failures of this
sort, are chronicled, this benign Government
may sit up and do some tall thinking.

Mark Twain -Chicago Tribune
If a man goes to another and represents
himself as the owner of something he is de
sirous of selling; and if the second party
buys, paying real money, only to learn that
the seller had nothing but the hope or ex
pectation of acquiring what he had sold —you
can see how simple a case it is to have the
buyer arrested as a cheat and swindler.
But speculation is different—because it's
bigger, and those who engage in it are so well
known, and such important folks, and so on.
So the planter who secures only ninety bales
of cotton where he expected one hundred
bales, is simply “out” the ten bales; but the
cotton broker or speculator, who thought the
farmers’ chances good for bringing in the
hundred bales, HAS SOLD THEM BE

preme indifference to too much or too little

recent disclosures of cotton
speculators. The enormous
The farmer gets the money for his ninety
bales, but the promoter doesn’t turn any loose
because of the lack of the ten: he “squeezes”
that number from another lot, tr using in luck
to make up the shortage or sell his option on
other sales before he reaches the end of his
rope.
If only one or two were engaged in the ma
nipulation, it wouldn’t be so bad, but with
hundreds of firms and individuals engaged in
gambling with Nature as to how much she
will or will not produce, the condition of the
cotton markets just now may be imagined,
with the crop millions of bales short.
But some day old U. S. will wake up
and give us some real legislation which
will prohibit gambling in futures, not
only of cotton but wheat and every
other product.

The development of inter-urban car
lines takes the crew each car some
times beyond the limit of human habi

that at least the conductor will have a
sum of money on his person, and, un

murderous thugs as killed the two car
men Saturday.
The road for which they worked is
an enormously wealthy corporation,
and it is likely the widows and orphans
of the two men will be provided for,
but the tragedy will draw attention to
the fact that railway men are the most
exposed to danger and have absolutely
no safeguards thrown around them for
their protection, by their employers.
If a list could be made of all the mail
clerks who have been killed like rats,

engineers and firemen could be named
who have died at their posts, the list
would be appalling.
