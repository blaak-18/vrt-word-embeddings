DANIEL PRATT'3 IMPRrVED
"Revo1ving Hea d"
COTTON GIN
PATENTED JULY 1 1873.
IPRICE REIDUCED
TO $4 50 PER SAW.
THIS GIN has been in use for the past
three seasons, and several recent im
provements have been added. It obvi
ates all friction at the ends of the cotton
box, prevents the roll from braking, and
gives a LARGER YIELD OF LINT from
the same amount of Seed than any other
Gin in use. The Revolving Head light
ens the draft and causes the Gin to run
faster with less driving power, thus do
ing a great deal more work within the
same time, while economizing steam or
animal power, than any other Gin. The
seed being ginned very close, the length
of the st;alle is increased, producing cot
ton on this account of a greater market
value. 'This improved value, given by
lenrth of staple, with extra production
of lint, added to increased amount of
wo' k done, more than covers the cost
of the Gin in every 100 bales ginned.

The revenue bill, as reported by 0
the Committee of Ways and Means, 01
is very voluminous, and contains i10 n
sections. For all parishes, except p
that of Orleans, *t;ae assessor shall be I l
elhetcd, the Governor having power o
to appoint one till the election shall s
have been held and ascertained. g
lProperty shall be assessed once in ti
every four years, but the asessments sl
shall be ievised annually. When ao
line between two parishes dirides a R
property the assessment shall be d
made in the parish where the oecu- a
pant resides. In all cases of doubt
regarding the value of property the !
assessor shall call in two freeholders, e
one to be selected by the assessor, a
and the other by the occupier of the tl
property, and should they disagree, p
an umpire shall be chosen. Should ii
the occupier consider himself then e
aggrieved, he may appeal to the dis- 9
trict court. A board of revision, to ]i
which complaints may be made, shall J
consist of the sheritf, recorder and p
clerk of the distiict court, with the 11
sheriff as chairnuan, who shall receive
each $2 a day while serving.
The assessor shall receive in com- a
pensation three per cent. on the first f
$40,0t00 of State and parish taxes, and
one per cent. on any excess of this
amount, provided that no salary shall a
be less than $500 for the year. t
TAX COLLECTORS. a
By this act all sheriffs hereafter are
made the tax collectors, the Governor
having power to appoint collectors till
the next regular election for sheriff in q
each parish takes place. The tax
collector (or sheriff) shall receive 5
pet cent. on the first $40,000 collected
and paid into the treasury, divided in
ratio between the palish and State
taxes; and 21 per cent. for any t
amount in excess of this sum; pro
vided, that the entire compensation
shall not he less than $750. $I shall
be allowed for each sale, and 25 cents
for each seizure.
In case of refusal or neglect of a
taxpayer to pay the taxes before the t
Ist of May, the taxes shall bear 8 per f
cent. interest till paid. In cases of
sales by the collector, the proper ty
will be shlt to the highest lidder for
cash. the bid to be accepted at least
equaling the taxes and costs. Prop
erty solhi is made redeemable within
two years on playment of the p1urchase
mouey, with 1 per ccnt a month in
terest, and all the taxes that may t
have been paid in' the meantime.
Property bought in by the State shall
annually be put up for sale, all the
costs accruing in the meantime to be
- added to the original.
PARISII OF ORLEANS.
The City Council shall appoint an
r assessor for each mnnicipal district of
the parish of Orleans, for the max
aimum term of four years, reserving
the right to remove at pleasure. They
Oshall be under the immediate direc
tion of the Administrator of Assess
Sments, and shall leceive salaries to
be stated by the Council, provided
t such shall not exceed $2500 for the
Syear in which a new assessment is
Smade, and $1500 for the other years.
f The clerical services required must
t not entail a higher cost than $12,500)
per annum.
The Administrator of Finance shall
be the collector of State and city taxes
for the city, and hlie shall make daily
settlements with the State Auditor
under pain of removal from oflice.
. The Administrator shall reserve one
per cent. of taxes collected to be paid
into the city treasury, for the cost of
collection.
No parish or municipal tax shall
- exceed one pier cent. on the assessed
value; and no special or judgment tas
of any kind beyond this limit shall be
levied.
The bill comes up in the House
Thursday as thle special order.
A Smuggler's Stratagem.
Thle Albany Argus says: "The trial
of Wallace H. Webster and Martin
V. B. Meeker, now on in the United
States District Court, has developed
some interesting facts. From the evi
dence elicited it would appear that
Webster, who resided at Malone,
Franklin County, and Meekler, a resi
dent of Moira, in the same county,
established what is termed a 'line
store' at Trout River, on the Canada
line, thirteen miles from Malone. One
door opened into Canada, and the
other into New York State. Through
this domicile it is charged that they
brought large quantities of shoe serge,
and, it is supposed, many other arti
cles into the State, which, by evading
the payment of duty thereon, they
were enabled to sell to shoe manutac
turers fi'om ten to twelve per cent.
less than the market price. The de
fendants endeavored to negotiate with
of Ferry & Sons, of this city, to take
some of this serge, and-actually for
warded a case to the address of H.
L. French, which was seized in.the
Central depot by Spocial Agent Rob
ertson; The isame agent also seized
five eases at Rochester, and tracing
a the matter up, finally arrested the
parties named. It is said they have
been engaged in the business for
years, andd, according to the evidence
otf one manufacturer, the prisoner
fbster boasted that the government
odtlid give $5;000 if it could secure
- them. The case was summed up and
* given to the jury, who'were still out

A Proposed Vagrant Law.
N. O. Times. "
Thlrough the courtesy of Mr. Harry
SWilde, member of thile House front
the Second Ward of this city, i~e
I Lave been shiown the text of a bill
Srelative to vagrants which hlie intro
Sduced last Friday.
S The first section of thlis bill gives
Squite a comprelihesive dlefinitiii of
C vagrancy, ilncludingi not only idle
Spersons without visible means of sup
port, but all persons who are known
to have no means of livelihood, all
d persons engaged in "roping," aiding,
or abetting gambling, and all profes
Ssional beggars. The second section
e also declares that all persons appre
hIended with any pick-locks or other
e instruments used for Ihousbreaking,
etc., shall be also considered vagrants.
Section 3d provides tile mananer of
arrest, trial and punishment of va-.
l grants-inflicting a penalty of com
n mittal to tie Work House for not less
id than three nor more than six nmonths,
d and labor on the streets tinder tile
- laws and ordinances of the city. Sec
t tion 4th provides for tile arrest and
, trial of those apprehended with
- tousebreaking instrunmlents. Section
, 5th authorizes the detective and other
e police officers to arrest all persons
a whom tley may know to be thiwves,
e gamnblers and dangerous characters,
e and directs how they shall be dealt
b with. Section 6th provides fr the
ty punishment of persons who harbor
, vagrants and suspicious characters;
- section 7 repeals all other hiTws con
Sflictilg with this; and section 8 di
Y rects that this act shall go into ettect
- immediately after its passage.
It. In reviewing the first three sections
- of this bill, the doubt arises whether
h. it will be operative or not It may
:e be decided by the courts to be in ci,i
- flict with the constitution of the
. State, as has been thie case with the
e law already incorporated in the
- statutes. Article 3' of thie Constitu
d tion declares tbit '"here shall be
g neither slavery nor involuntary servi
e tude in this State, otherwise than for
e the puantishment of crime, whereof the
or party shall have been dutdy convicted ;"
ce and in the second clause of Article 6,
er we find it laid' down that '"the accus.
tt ed shall be entitled to a speedy public
re trial by an impartial jury." That
id these articles of the Constitutioln
at might serve to defeat thle illtentions
of- the framer of this bill seems pro
hable; and regret it though we may,
there does not applear to be any way
out of the diliculty. Thertft.ro its
passage in this form would be unnec
essary and useless lahbor. If tlth de
sign is to have laws which cannot be
enforced, the one we aldready have
will answer ainut as well as any Dt
other.
'liThe section relating to the arrest of
prohfissional thieves, gambtris and
dangerous characters, appear to Ilace
too imnuch power in the hands of the
ptlice, and shouitl he carefully revis
ed and this objetiomtable feature
eliminated. While it is to the inter- R
est of the colinint ity tlhat such cha;Ir
acters as tire section contemuplates to
Imnish should lie mi: dle amenable, it
is still of the highest illlmportanice that
the liberty of citiztns should not be
endangered in such a nlllllner.
The solution of thie vagrant ques
ti'ºn appears to be environied by mtany ele
dilliculties. A trial of the otf'eiders i
by a jury night prove very expeu
sire, but as it aplpearls to be the only vol
course to pIirsue, it should Ihe resort
ed to. Yet some jmeians should be
adopted by which the State could be
reimnlu se.l for the expense it entiled list
by atfixin g such a term of service as
would enable the conviets to work it
out. WeV, always need lalhorers on
our1 phublic imnplrovelileits, and fromi
thei number of vagraints that are now til
rushing into the State, an ample sup- cot
ply iighit Ibe recruited in the way we
way we have indicated. ant

An Extraordinary Scene. of
The following account of the ex- T
atmination of Wells is given by the
\Washington correspondent of the St. lie
Louis Republican: an
A more extiaordinary scene has
never been witnessed in Congression
al investigations than the exanina
tion of J. Madison VWells this after
noon. His direct examination by
Judge Lawrence on the part of the
Republicans was uninteresting, but no
when David D)udtley Field took hold
of Inm it began lively at the very
start and kept it up through three )"
long hours. One of the most skillful tlt
cross examiners in the Americani bar sa
and one of the greatest rogues living in
were pitted against each other; one
strong with remarkable adroitness to sot
drag forth the secrets of the most cit
damning iniquity which blots the
history of the Republicans, the other
struggling with thie desperation of su
despair to cover up the evidences of st:
his guilt. He was gradully drawn p
into the toils of his relentless examin
er, however, and piece by piece com
pelled to confess the whole story of
corrnptitn and fraud in which lihe en
gaged, a willing tool of conspilators O<
who plotted to deflat the will of the
people. lie was so filled with dismay
and consternation at the conteiunlla- At
tion of his own helplessnes and ina- co
bility to escape the crllshing mass of 11
evidence that was grad:lally heaped tit
against hint thllt lie grew reckless in ,
Shis wild efforts to palliate his crime D
and explain away the damning testi- t
mouny which his own hand had writ- SI
tea against himself. Sentence by
sentence the letter to West was read m
to him, and his explanation of its
purpose and meaning drawn out ini
such a way that he had not been five it
minutes under examination before lihe
had condemned himself half a dozen
times. al
Excuses, apologies, denials, con- ..
tradictions, followed one after tihe
other with such rapidity that it is no
I exaggeration to say tihat hle gave the
lie to himself fully a hundred times
ii three hours. He was kept on the
rack by thi merciless Field. Evasive is
one muomnient anid stubbbrn tihe next,
his examination was exciting uutil
almost stormy from the beginnuiug to T
r the end. The detailed report ofi
m questions and Ranswers will convey no
e idea of the scene enacted, andit is ab- ,
1I solutely impossible to fitly character
- ize it. Wells had great advantage in i
the fact that hie was alteady under
s punishment for contempt in refusiing i
f to obey the commands of the conm
le mittee, and he knew that it was im- i
- possible to increase his punishlment,
i for there are no thumb-screws or oth
I1 er inquisitorial appliances in tlhese
, days to make a man toll what'he does
s- not want to. Knowing this well,
n Wells was blustering, offensive and
i- insultinig. Assumineg offence to him- a
r self in Field's questionls where there
, was not the slightest possiblo excuse
. for him to be oflfended, hie several
uf times threatened to protect himself if
.- the committee did not protect him,
- and it is said that hie actually had two

[ ' ecial to the Vindirator.J
NE\V OnLA.ss, La., Feb. 10.-The
electoral tribunal decided to count
Florida for II.AIvs by a strict party
vote. BIutnAmE voted with the Re
publicans.
The Demnocrat this evening pub
lished the following special from
\Washington :
"The house is to take a recess un
til noon to-day, but IFlorida will be
counted for IIhAes. Every precaution
and preparatilon has been taken for
the Louisiana case, and if one spark
of fairness remains in the conmisstoc,
Tt.LDEN is safe.
The Nicholls Government is not
neceasstrily involved in this decission,
and will be maintained.

The Democrats have determined
not to yiehl to the vet dict of the tri
LYnal, in case its action in regard to
ir. vote of Louisiana is marked by
the same derse and desperate paiti
sanship that characterized its action
in the Florida case. There may be
some fun yet before the thing is de
cided. BUELI.
Impossible to predict what the re'
suit will be, but under no circum
stances will the people here stand.
