A Brutal Assault,
Last Friday, the 192th, while Victor
Fleury, a young and haurd working clti n
sen, was hauling wood from Mr. A. E. '
Sompayrac's place on Cane River, a short f
distance from this city, he was assaulted 0
by a colored man named Albert Ronqlier. ii
with a stick, and sbockingly beaten h
about the head, faee and on his arm sad 0
i ide. He was left senseless and bleeding B
by his assailant, who ded after the per- It
petration of the deed. Mr. FPleury was e
injured internally and has been in bed 
ever sinse the occrranee. The day be Ia
fore the assault, Rouquter had been aba- i
sing Fleury about his load of wool, and iw
the quarrel was resumed on the 12th,.
resulting in almost the death of leary. s

L ist Thursday quite a number of the

miles from Natebitoe~he, and is noted for
u its magnlldasnt springs, and grest health
Sflnesss its name intlicates. In anti
hellum times it was a favorite place of

whose sides are covered with juttin,
rooks, and the springs Bow from the hill
sides into a deep ravine, They have been
walled np withstone and their ehrystal
water is as cool as the now clad peaks
of some mountain range. The road is a
deciledly rough one, fall of rats, and
what wonder that the fair lamies bhonld
utter cries of fear as the vehicles tilted
sideways in some deep eut or along a
rough hill side, and gasp their escorts to
prevent-falling tont! The manly youths
,lid'nt object one particle to this confi

play was a most delightful one and the
young people seemed to enjoy the oec.

into the forest nshales, doubtless. the nyl

light of oy beaming from eyes which

of the picnie was the presence of the
Brass Band whose music teechord among

When the snn wa, dippir r into the

ter, of eourws. lnt one will mlore than
soave the cost of hbuilding in a bshort time
iby hayvisng lsuch a room. Build out of
1pin or other lllmber, a box louse 16x18
feet. and hattes,. on the outside. In one
end have a window on either side of the
window one or two shelves ean be mands;
senesth these' stand your work bench
and chest of tools; at the other end have
a stimt platform, ive feet from the
ground, four feet wide, on which can be
placed plows and the box containing
your harvester; beneath will be room
for drills,%orn plasters, cultivators, rakes
&c., with their onguaes removed. On
either side have a plase for bhoes and
garden tools. Overhead you can place
lumber to season. In one side have a
large door. You can have a stove in the
room in winter and it will be a capital
place to do odd jobs of mending, making,
&e. Have a box for buckles, rings,
straps, and ends generally. It is very
annoying to always he losing something,
and ridiculous to see a great sixftoter
call out wife, and daughter and hired
men to hunt a lost hatchet, and after
hunting everywhere, find it at last just
where he threw it down himself after
using it. Have a place for everything,
and everything in its place. It will save
you time,
It is poverty striken economy to keep
a poor breed of stock. Farmers begin
torealize this fact. It is better to have
six animals of a good breed, than five
times as many poor, miserable eresturaes,
which make one shudder to look at
them. The time It takes for them to
mature, and the food they consume der
nlg that time, will more than pay for
good ones. I was provoked at a farmer
last winter. He was the owner of a
splendid Berkshire sow, whioh he was
preparing to kill. I expostalated with
him, telling him to keep ber for a brood
sow by all means. He said he was "too
poor to keep such a hog." Now, that is a
mistake; it is the poor men who need
such animals, If they ever expect to be
anything lust poor men. Men will some
day understand the value of pare breeds
ofutte, horser sheep aed bhogs, pa well
as poultry-and I was going to say, ua
less you think it is improper, that it
would apply to people too.
Farmers, save the manure ; it is of na
told value. Farmers generally are aware
of the value of manure, but we often see
it shamefully wasted while their land is
snifering for it. Do not let your barn
S"ls become knee deep in mannre and
mid in winter. Haul it out on your
fields in the proper season.
Look after all these items, and you
will get along easier and better. You
will have all winter, of.eonrse, to make
and mend, but an hour's work at the
right time, will sometimes save a day or
a week. If youear harness breaks, do not
tie it with a string, when a tbckle or
rivet would mend it properly. No mat
ter what you do, do it well. Keep things
up. Live within your inoee, snd lay

His fes will wear no mere for thee,
The look of anguisb'd pain,
Which the' no moisturediumed thine eye
Was burt upon thy brain
And on his yroutbfel brow will lay
The light of Heavens eternal day.
Oh! name him nota moug the dead!
As real as the world we see
As owery.eartb, or starry sky,
Does his existence seem to me s
Leave thou, the realm of shadows dim,
And in that wora go loek for l.
He lives, oh ever lives for thee
So closely do ear lives entwine
That n amoreehut fom earth sd ensee
Hispirit being is, than tbinae.
Doa-he too feel the mournful etrife,
The paln of this divided life
A closer union will be ors,
I feel, I know, for God isJuet,
Ele life were vain, and nature false
I,, Him teach thou the heart to trust
Walk then life's patth with bopel eyes
And waittha meeting Ia the skiese
