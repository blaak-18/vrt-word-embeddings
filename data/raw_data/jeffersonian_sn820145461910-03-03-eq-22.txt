PAGE TWENTY-TWO
A Defense of Adam
I thought that, among all men,
there had ever been universal con
tempt for that trait of Adam’s char
acter which prompted him to “lay it
on” Eve, instead of shouldering his
own guilt.—Watson’s Magazine.
It is surprisingly strange that so
many persons, many of them Bible
readers, hold the view expressed in
the above paragraph.
As a matter of fact, according to
the Bible, Adam, because of his
great love for Eve, made the great
est sacrifice in the history of the
world, except the sacrifice of Jesus
Christ, of which Adam’s sacrifice was
the ante-type. In other words, Ad
am’s love and sacrifice for Eve was
an illustration of the love and sacri
fice of Jesus for his people.
The Bible tells us that Eve trans
gressed because she was deceived.
She carried the fruit to Adam. The
Bible tells us that Adam was not de
ceived. He knew the consequences
of violating God’s law. But, the
woman by her act of disobedience
had separated herself from Adam
forever. No act of hers could regain
her lost purity and innocence, nor
abate the death penalty which rested
upon her.
But Adam’s love for her knew no
abatement. Doubtless her pitiful
condition rather intensified it. At
any rate there was no hesitation on
his part as to the course to pursue.
He could also violate God’s laws, and
then he would be with Eve. He pre
ferred rather to die with her than
to live without her. So casting
away his sinless perfection, with all
of its glorious privileges, he took the
fruit, “and he did eat.”
When the Lord asked Adam,
“Hast thou eaten of the tree where
of I commanded thee that thou
shouldst not eat?” Adam did not
“lay it on” the woman. He merely
stated a fact which carried with it
its own explanation. He said: “The
woman whom thou gavest to be with
me, she gave me of the tree, and I
did eat.” God knew the reason.
Adam’s great love for Eve would not
permit him to let her die alone.
It was just such love that actuated
Jesus when He took upon Himself our
nature, took our flesh and blood and
endured all our afflictions and temp
tations, and then suffered the death
on the cross that we might have life,
and “have it more abundantly.”
Jesus is denominated in the Bible as
the “second Adam,” and his people
are represented as His bride.
Nowhere on the pages of history,
either sacred or profane, are there
such illustrious examples of self-de
nial and sacrifice as those of Adam
and the man Christ Jesus.
We are led into this defense of
Adam, because it is right, and again,
because he is distantly related to our
editor.—Jasper News.
This is a very subtle, a very beau
tiful and a very splendid defense of
Adam. We do not remember to have

ever seen anything like it before, and
we transfer it to our columns with a
great deal of pleasure, because we
are glad to be able to say that our
forefather, though disobedient, was
not totally depraved, and was not
without a line of saving grace.
It cannot be alleged that Eve did
not have a guilty knowledge of her
disobedience, because she said to her
beguiler: “We may eat of the trees
of the garden; but the fruit of the
tree which is in the midst of the gar
den, God hath said, ye shall not eat
of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest
ye die.” Still, an examination of the
sacred volume will disclose the fact
that Eve was never personally com
manded by God not to eat of the
“forbidden fruit.”
The Bible account of this unhappy
chapter is as follows:
“And the Lord God took the man
and put him in the garden of Eden,
to dress it and to keep it.
“And the Lord God commanded
the man saying: Os every tree of
the garden thou mayest freely eat.
“But of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, thou shalt not eat
of it; for the day thou eatest thereof
thou shalt surely die.”
It will thus be seen that this com
mand, which has brought so much
woe into the world, was given unto
the man and not unto the woman.
An investigation will show that it
was given to Adam before Eve was
created, and if it was ever repeated
to Eve, Moses, acting as the divine
emanuensis, failed to record it, or it
may have been omitted and lost in
the various translations through
which the Bible has passed.
It is significant in this connection
that God, in rebuking Adam and Eve
for their disobedience, he said to
Eve: “What is this that thou hast
done?” but when He comes to Adam
He repeats the admonition that was
given him, as will be seen in the
quotation: “Because thou hast
harkened unto the voice of thy wife
and hast eaten of the tree of which
I commanded thee, saying, Thou
shalt not eat of it.”
God did not bring this accusation
against the woman, so we conclude
that Eve’s sin was not as sinful as
Adam’s.
Eve’s temptation must have been
very great. Her tempter in this chap
ter is said to have been more subtle
than any beast of the field, and most
commentators agree that it was Sa
tan, because in other parts of the
Bible Satan is called a serpent.
Christ was subjected to the same
temptation but resisted it, but He
was superhuman, but how many oth
ers have done so? How many, like
Eve, have been beguiled, and like
her have fallen?
Brother Caldwell says that when
God rebuked Adam he did not lay
his sin on Eve, but he simply stated
a fact. Nor did Eve lay her sin on
Adam. She likewise stated a fact
when saying: “The serpent beguiled
me, and I did eat.” * She did not at
tempt a denial. She did not at
tempt to shift the responsibility of
her sin onto the shoulders of her
husband. She did as so many wom
en have done since—shouldered the
whole blame. She could have said
that the command was never given
to her, but that it was given to her
husband before her creation, but she
preferred to tell the truth and suffer
the consequences.
It was a sad performance, but we
are disposed to believe the woman
suffered the greater temptation and
the greater punishment, and if there
was any nobility in the transaction
Eve’s was as great as Adam’s, and
it prefigured this trait in woman’s
character which has shown so re
splendant ever since.—Ocala (Fla.)
