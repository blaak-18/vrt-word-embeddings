New York, Feb. 23.--One's head must
be fastened on very tightly just now
to keep from losing it over the multi
plicity of new and attractive things
offered to the favored sex. How much
we are favored we may judge when
we take into account the endless list
of things made for us and the very
limited number provided for men.
They are obliged to be content with
coats, shirts, collars, trousers, hats,
cravats, gloves and boots, a very mea
ger showing when compared with all
the garments and fancies appertaining
to the feminine wardrobe. Men can
have but three or four kinds of hats.
and all trousers look alike, with small
differences as to quality and price, and
PLAID sPInOG sUIT.
all the rest of their apparel is appar
ently cut after the same pattern, al
lowing only for differences in shape of
the wearers.
Not so with women. They can each
follow the general line of the fashions
of the day, yet each be a law to herself.
Hats are as diverse as faces, for wom
akind is legion.
All this is shirking the main issue of
this letter, which was intended to tell
something about a few of the "delicious
creations," as the French call them, in
spring garments and other things here
Uinto appertaining.
One really ought to mention the shirt
waists, for never were-these extremely
useful garments so pretty as those of
this season. While the wailt portion
is not quite so baggy in firont, the
sleetes more than make ip for it. And
they are not so short in the back. This
will allow a womaa to loot as though

Some will have the pointed belt ef

all, it is a ,sirival of the fittest out of
11, the last season's styles. Folds,

these. waists. Many have beautiful

4th suht Side.
A phr graphert was asked the other
day if there is any special reason why
most photographs show the left side
ot the face and not the right.
"Yes, there is a reason," he answered.
"In a majority of cases the left side is
ie good looking lide, and photogra
phers know this and take advantage of
it. On the other hand, If you want to get
at the real strength and character of a
person's face, man or woman, study
the right side of it-the ugly side, as
some portrait painters call it. There
you will find the lines bold and harsh,
eomparatively so at any rate, with ev
ery defect accentuated. On the left
side, however, everything is softene4
down, and the face is at its best.
"Whenever you suspect a man of
trickery or deceit, or a woman either,
for that matter, stand on his right and
closely watch his expression. There
never was an actor skillful enough to
cover up the marks of his real person
ality, as nature has stamped them on
the right side of his face."

It may be that the quality of imagi
nation was lacking in the Boston and
Salem merchants who attempted in
1842 to introduce American ice into
London. One of them tried to attain
this end by demonstrating the merits
of American iced drinks. He hired a
hall, as the sfory goes, and trained a
number of men to mix the cool bever
ages of his native land. The members
of the Fishmongers' association, pre
sumably as fond of turtle as aldermen
themselves, were the guests. The wait
ers made an imposing entry, but, alas,
the first sound that met the ear of the
American "promoter," expecting a
chorus of approval, was that of an
English voice calling for hot water and
saying, "I prefer it, all in all." The
American completes the story, "I made
a dead rush for the door, next day set
tiled my bills in London. took train for
Liverpool and the steamer for Bostqn
and counted up a clear loss of $1,2Oi."

The Charge at M Arealo.
As an instance of magnificent blmn
dering, sung by poets and treasured ih
story, no record is evhr likely to come
up to that of the Light brigade in the
Crimean war. But, perhaps, most re
markable was Kellerman's charge at
Marengo. From daybreak till late aft
ernoon the Austrianm had the best of it.
Desaix said to Napoleon, "The battle
is completely lost," adding, "but it is
only 4 o'clock. There is time to gain
another one." A little later Keller

Ore litent lawTers.
The poverty of briefless barristers is
as proverbial as that of the church
mouse. It would not be an unnatural
mistake to consider a barrister with
only one client hardly better off than
one with none. But the modern "one
client lawyer" is usually a prosperous
individual. Said a man well known in
the business world some years ago to
a friend: "I want a young lawyer to
put down at a desk beside mine. I'll
familiarize him with my affairs, and
then I want him to keep me out of
trouble." The counterpart of this law
yer, whose duty it is to act as his own
client's ounce of prevention, may be
found in the office of many large con
cerns. He is often connected with
trust companies, banks, banking houses,
railroad and other transportation com
panies and large wholesale mercantile
houses. When a merchant found him
self in a tangle, it was once the cus
tom for him to go to his lawyer for ad
vice. The results were a 'written
"opinion" and a fee. The business man
today obtains a lawyer who shall work
for him alone. Again, the field of the
general practitioner is narrowed. -

Minnie Hauck as a Drummer.
Mme. Minnie Hauck was once sing
ing at the Berlin court opera in Doni
zetti's "Daughter of the Regiment."
Emperor, William I., after the opera.
called her into his presence and told
her she had sung very nicely, but that
her drumming-as the Daughter of the
Regiment she had to play the drum-was
very bad. Next morning a drum major
of the First Grenadier regiment called
at her hotel and said he had come to
give her a drum lesson. The diva was
bound to accept the instruction and
learned the whole art of drumming in
a couple of dozen lessons. Then the
kaiser sent to ask how she was getting
on, and, hearing that she had made ex
cellent progress, he commanded a per
formance of "A Daughter of the Regi
ment" Mine. Hauck acquitted herself
excellently in the drumming scene, and
the kaiser complimented her warmly,
sen4ing her next day a real official
military drum with a silver plate and
inscription.
An Interrupted Story.
Captain Williams, a jovial Irishman,
known everywhere as "Bob," used to
be a favorite in Dublin society many
years ago. His stories were famous.
Give him an incident, and he would set
it out to the general admiration.
One evening he went into the club
and there began telling-the true tale of
rsueuig a lady and her daughters from
a dangerou situation into which their
spirited horses had brought them.
"I quieted the ladles," said he, "and
I quieted the horses. And- the grati
tude of the ladies! Me boys, I shouldn't
be sarprised if her la.yship left me"
At that moment a little Irish page in

book. The reporter out of politeness
read a page. "Ah," said the senator,
"I see you are interested. Take the
book along and read it at your leisure.
Good evening." And the dazed young,
journalist was out on the sidewalk be

lelsn Keller's Island - BookpI
For Children.
Especial Correspondene,!
New York, Feb. 23.-There is a pret
ty story in connection with the autobi
ography of Helen Keller, the wonder
ful blind girl, shortly to be published
in book form, telling about her own
life from infancy to the present day.
She always has shrunk from the pub
licity which follows literary work, and
it was with great difficulty that she
was persuaded to take up the task of'
preparing her autobiography. She had,
however, set her heart on owning an
island in Halifax harbor for a sum
mer home, and in a spirit of fun the
editor of the Ladies' Home Journal of
fered to buy it for her or to provide the
means to buy it.
When the work of writing appearef
especially Irksome, Miss Keller was
reminded of her desire to become a
landholder, and it spurred her on.
Just before Christmas she completed
the first chapter of her marvelous story.
and on Christmas morning she received

A CHILD's BOOKPLATE.
from her publishers a check for a good
round sum. Her delight may be imag
ined, for this was the first money of
any account which she had ever earn
ed. "It is a fairy tale come true," she
said. Whether she buys the island or
rnot is another matter.
The youngsters of today are certain
ly becoming sophisticated. Children's
bookplates is the newest development
of this state. When the grownups of
today were girls and boys, they were
glad enough, many of them, to have
books to read. The child of today has
his own special library; in which the
books, like those in the big library,
mnst be marked with bookplates.
All lovers of books take delight in
the fashion of marking their volumes
with an individual design, and when
the book owner can devise his or her
own bookplate its value is greatly in
creased. What clever work the girls
and boys of the land can do along this
comparatively new and novel line is
shown by the bookplates published in
the February St. Nicholas, the prize
winners in a bookplate design contest
announced in November. The design
here shown, by courtesy of the Cen
tury company, is one of the best three
out of over fifty designs sent in to the
St. Nicholas office by girls and boys
from abroad as well as from all over
America. Clarence Tritt, who design
ed it, is seventeen years old and lives
in Los Angeles, Cal. This offers a sug
gestion for pleasant and profitable
work for other girls and boys.
News comes from England that a
massive and costly monument to knark
the last resting place of Bret Harte
has Just been erected in Frimby
churchyard, Surrey. His grave is in
the northeastern part of the church
yard, and around it have been planted
a number of young fir trees.
The monument consists of a massive
slab of white granite, weighing two
and a half tons, on which is placed a
block of Aberdeen granite sloping up
ward in the form of a cross. Simplie
Ity itself is the inscription, "Bret
Harte, Aug. 25, 1887; May 5, I902;
Death Shall Reap No Braver Harvest."
A movement has been started in Lon
don to ereet a memorial to the author
in the metropolis, and from the rate
that subscriptions are coming in it
will not be very long before a sufficient
sum is raised.
Ellen Glasgow, who is spending the
winter in New York, says that she, in a
roundabout way, owes the publication
of her frst published novel to Harold
Frederic. She had already brought one
novel in manuscript to New York and
failed to place it. She went home,
wrote another book and brought it
here. History repeated itself. Pub
lishers were stony hearted. At last in
sheer despair she sent the manuscript
anonymously to a well klown irm. It
was accepted, because the reader into
whose hands it fell was sure that he
had a book by Harold Frederic and
that the firm couldn't afford to miss it.
This was the beginning of the very
succestful career of the author of "The
Voice of the People."
Mrs. Humphry Ward has had an en
viable experibnce in life in the respect
of a continual domestic association
with brilliant men. She is a daughter
of Thomas Arnold, editor and author;
a granddaughter of the famous Dr. Ar
nold of Rugby and a niece of Matthew
Aeld. Her husband, Thomas Hum
y Ward, is an Oxford man, best
luw perhaps for his edition of "The
