CYCLOPS EXPLAINS AIMS OF KLANSMEN
Rev. C. A. Rexroad Declares Himself A Member
(Rtirrnu of Piblkitlon i*nd Mvctlhtn)
WASHINGTON. D. C.. March 20.
Admitting that he is the Exalted Cy
clops of the Ku Klux Klan in Spo
kane. Washington, and holds the key
over the entire outfit of robes and
hoods, the Rev. C. A. Rexroad, pastor
of the Corbin Park Methodist church,
recently addressed a packed audi
ence and gave the first portion of his
talk entitled “My Answer." declaring
that he was officially affiliated with
the Klan. Here is the 9tory as it
comes from Spokane:
“Estimated that 600 crowded into
the church and hundreds were turned
away. It was an orderly, good-na
tured crowd, a few cheered occasion
ally, words of encouragement were
called out, applauded for a minute
or more at the conclusion of the ad
dress.
“In closing Rev. Mr. Rexroad said:
‘I am resigning from nothing. 1 am
not a quitter. I am going to stay in
Spokane. I’ll stick to my guns.
When I get ready to leave Spokane
I’ll go, but it won’t be because of
these venomous, lying attacks on me’
“Rev. Mr. Rexroad said he had re
ceived 1.000 telephone calls commend
ing his stand and only one call and
one letter criticising him for his
Klan affiliations. He branded the In
glewood, Oklahoma. Herrin and Mer
Rouge affairs as ‘set-ups’ to discredit
the Klan. He branded each of them
a failure and declared the final re
sult of investigation to be a vindica
tion of the Klan. He said the Ku
Klux Klan is a fine Christian institu
tion which investigates a man’s mor
als carefully before admitting him
to membership.
“The robe and hood are used only
in ceremonial work, mainly at ini
tiations. he said. They are not dis
tributed among the membership.
They are all locked up and I hold
the key. The Klan has been through
a great housecleaning recently. Un
fortunately some men went into it
for financial gain. Te Klan is getting
better every day. You can’t line up
4,500,000 natural born Americans in
any organization that hasn’t high
ideals. I can tell you truthfully, be
cause I know, that the time is com
ing when Klansmen will come out in
the open and be known. What a hul
labaloo there will be then.
“He declared Klansmen killed in
riots are martyrs who died in the
cause of liberty. He denied that the
Klan is antagonistic to the negro,
but is friendly to him and is endeav
oring to solve his problems and pro
tect him from exploitation. He said

that the Klan is not hostile to ft>r
egners as such, but is convinced that
too many foreigners of the sort that
will not assimilate with Americans
are being admitted to this country.
The Klan is a Protestant Christian
organization and no unbeliever can
belong. It is none of our business
if a Catholic joins the Knights of Co
lumbus, and we hold it is none of
their business if a Protestant joins
the. Klan. The Klan is not built on
malice and hate, but upon justice
and fair dealing, and we preach them
more than some preachers. We are
opposed to persecution in every form.
The Klan believes in our public
schools and wants an equal chance for
all in them. We tolerate no individ
ual friction between a Klansman and
a Catholic.”

Imperial Representative
Uncovered Fraudulent
Scheme
MINISTER TS INVEIGLED
$2.y)00 Illinois Farm Given to
“Dummy" Winner for Prize
Slogan
(Hiirrau of Publication and Kducatlon)
WASHINGTON. I). C.. March 20.
If there is any one thing in which the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and all
good Americans are strong, it is in
teaching respect and obedience to
the law. It is one of the fundamen
tal tenets of the organization, and
all officials and members are required
to use all legal means to aid the prop
erly constituted authorities in en
forcing the law. In the discharge
of this obligation it becomes a sol
emn duty to see that all members of
the Klan are just as amenable and
obedient to the law as others outside
the order.
In that manner members of the
Klan vindicate their position regard
ing those who are guilty of law vio
lations, even if thtey happen to be
in the organization itself. That is
what makes the Klan so strong, viz.,
it stands for law enforcement, even
if it has to clean house on the in
side itself, and that is what it does
at times.
The Klan did this very thing in
several cases in the south; it has done
it in Washington when one of its
members was turned up to the au
thorities for bigamy; it is now re
specter of officials or former officials
if they go wrong.
A St. Louis Case
The Klan takes credit for being
the first to give information to the
district attorney and the government
authorities in tho St. Louis case of
former publishers of the St. Louis
Patriot, a pro-Klan paper, becoming
involved in a shady business transac
tion. It was the splendid work of
George C. McCarron, of Kansas City,
imperial representative of the Klan
Child Bureau Is
One-Man Affair
IML ROBERT M. WOODBURY
This is Dr. Robert Morse Wood
bury, director of statistical research
of the children’s bureau, Washing
ton, which includes investigations
and reports on all matters pertain
ing to child life and welfare of
American people. He is the only
man in this bureau.
in Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska,
who made a thorough investigation of
the newspaper scheme whereby The
Patriot last fall offered a $25,000 Il
linois farm as the prize for the best
slogan to be adopted by that paper.
When the bubble burst and the
scheme fell flat, the publishers of
that paper at the time picked out a
“dummy.” awarded the farm to him
with an understanding that he in re
turn would return it to the original
owner and thereby sought to deceive
and defraud.
As soon as the imperial represent
ative secured all the evidence he
turned it over to the United States
district attorney, for his considera
tion with a view of an investigation
by the government under federal
statutes relating to the misuse of
the mails. Accompanying the other
evidence was a confession on the part
of the then business manager, who
happened to be the pastor of the
Fourth Christian church in St. Louis.
The preacher became involved in the
transaction really before he realized
what he was doing or the seriousness
of the difficulty he was getting into,
instead of the Klan officials condon
ing a bad scheme or seeking to hide
or cover up the alleged fraudulent
deal, they were the first to expose it.
In speaking of it Mr. McCarron, im
perial representative, says:
Methods I'nethlsai
“Mv investigation discloses, as per
attached statements of persons in
volved. signed in the presence of a
number of witnesses, that methods
which are unethical and insincere,
if not actually wrongful, have been
used to secure subscriptions for The
Patriot, a periodical published in St.
Louis, as a pro-Klan. though unoffi
cial organ. According to the state
ments obtained, the publishers of
The Patriot solicited and obtained
subscriptions on a promise to give
away a farm to the author of a suc
cessful slogan.
“They were warned by postal offi
cials of the lottery law. and the paid
subscription requirement was aban
doned, but the promise of the farm
was carried on and the offer was wid
ened to include all who desired to
submit slogans. I ater a plan was
formulated by which a figurehead
was selected and the farm awarded
to him. This figurehead sets out in
his sworn statement that the farm
was then retransferred to the former
owner, who was the author of the slo
gan circulation campaign and who
had a contract for half the subscrip
tions collected.”
Preacher Resigns
The minister. Rev. C. C. Crawford,
tendered his resignation to his church
with a frank statement of how he had
been led into the diffculty. The
(hurch board issued a statement that
their minister had made a mistake
and they refused to accept his resig
nation and called on all the church
members to stand by him in a sym
pathetic attitude.
The whole point to be made in this
story is that the Klan does not in
dorse anything shady, and. on the
other hand, is the first to dig up and
expose wrongdoing even if it exists
in its own organization. This is as
it should be.
Kentucky Legislature
Passing School
Bible Bill
(Hnrran rubllratl«n and Kduratton)
WASHINGTON. D. C.. March
24. —The Rash bill, providing for
the daily reading of the Bible in
common schools of Kentucky, has
been signed by Governor Fields,
ending a fight waged in the ses
sion of the legislature which has
just closed. The measure passed
the senate 31 to 1. after having
carried 77 to II in the Kentucky
house.
The Bible must be read in every
classroom every day “in the pres
ence of the pupils” under the act.
Revocation of teachers’ certifi
cates is provided for failure to
comply with the law.
This sentiment is rapidly grow
ing, notwithstanding the intense
opposition to it. But just make
inquiry as to whom the opposition
comes from and then you will be
gin to understand this American
and anti-American fight that is
being waged all over the United
States.

Selling a 15-cent package of cig~-

E. 4th street, $25 in municipal court
the other day.
Many complaints that this storer
has been selling cigarets to school
boys have recently been received by
the police department from neigh
boring schools. Saturday morning a
boy was sent in to make a purchase
while an officer waited outside and
observed the transaction. The cig
arets were sold without questioning,
M. J. Hartman was charged withp
violating the cigaret ordinance. His
case was continued to March 28 for
trial.
One interesting thing about the
presidency of the United States ia
that although the president may not
be at all greedy of responsibility he
usually has to take a good deal of it.
That’s American, too.
Each side is accusing the other of
playing politics and of course the
Democrats forcing these investiga
tions are coming in for their share
of the universal criticism that is
making itself felt all over the coun
try. Republicans claim that the
Democrats retaliate by declaring
that the Republicans have no legis
lative program to be held up, and'
there you are. The country will hear
a lot about this in the coming cam
