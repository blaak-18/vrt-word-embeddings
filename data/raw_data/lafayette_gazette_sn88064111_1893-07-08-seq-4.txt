anything but the exhibits, and it was tl
tory to open the grounds to visitors on n
Sunday and charge only twenty-five Ii
cents admission. ti
This action on the part of the direc- tI
tory, or the intelligence that such ac- ti
tion was contemplated, greatly annoyed ti
I the church people of the whole coutt - t
try, and steps were taken to prevent to
the opening if possible. It has. been it
reported that pressure was brought to i
bear on the national commissioners in v
order to defeat the intetions of the di- E
rectory. How true this is cannot be
stated, but this much is certain, the p
commissioners have done nothing up to t
I the present writing to thwart the ii
wishes of the directory. The latest o
move on the-part of the board was to t>
amend the rules, which precluded Sun- p
day opening, to read as follows:
.
THE WOODS
"The exposition shall be open for a
the admission of visitors until Oc- p
tober S0, 1893, on each day of the p
week, subject, however, to the fol- I
lowing regulations for the manage- a
ment and conduct of the exposition I
Sundays: On each and every Sunday e
the operation of the machinery in Ma- 1
I chinery hall and elsewhere shall be t
suspended as far as practicable. Exhib
itors and employes shall be relieved 1
from duty except so far as their pres- t
ence is essential and necessary for the I
protection of property and the public
peace, but all employes whose services s
are required Sunday shall be given one 1
day of rest during the week. Religious
services may be held each Sunday in
Choral and Music halls at such hours as
shall be designated and named by the
S council of administration, and said
council shall have authority to arrange 1
3 for such services. The fee of admis
[ sion on Sunday is fixed at fifty cents."
The board also voted to return the
partly retained gift of $2,500,000 to the
government, and the decision was
placed in the form of a rule to be forth
with submitted to the national com
mission. It is said that many of the
commissioners are pleased with the
board's action and the chances for a
seven days' fair are increasing.
. In the meantime the people flock out
to the fair groundson Sunday and poke
about as if they entertained hopes of
being by some special dispensation of
the fair officials permitted to enter.
Finding the turnstiles immovable they
wander off to theydehlows and scatter
their small change among the one-horie
vendors of creature comforts who ply
their callings on Sunday as well as any
other day. There are shows of various
kinds in the neighborhood of the fair,
merry-go-rounds, roller-coasters and the
like. and these do a thriving business
when the crowds rebound from the
barred entrances of the fair.
The work in the grounds still goes
on on Sunday, and the workmen are
doubtless glad .that the people are kept
out one day in the week, so that they
can work undisturbed for a few hours
at a stretch. The exhibits are all rapidly
nearing completion and in the course
of a few days the noise of the carpenters
will have entirely ceased in most of the
buildings.
SThe restaurant question is not fully
settled as yet, and the lunch basket is
still a popular institution with the
Speople. They are bound to stick it out,
and if things keep on as they are some
of the restaurant keepers are going to
be bankrupted. Therehas been a great
Sreduction in prices in some of the eat
Sing houses, however, and with those
Swho have made the reduction trade is
getting better, and by the time the
summer erowd commences to pour in
this trouble will be practically settled.
In consequence of the unheard-of
I weather we have been having there has
been much discomfort aunong the for
Seigners in Midway Plaisance. It does
seem as if the elements had conspired
to show the people of other lands what
a perfectly insupportable climate we
have tn this part of the world. For a
Sfew days there was sunshine. Not the
* warm and comfortable kind they have
r In the sunny climes from which many
of them came, but a weaIknd watery
imitation of the real thing. This en
couraged them to venture 'forth from
the secluasios into which the cold and
rain had driven them, But thaeo Would
aeo1S erw get abroad than a sold bans W
.8 clouds would eover up old 8So's luke
wrurq visage, and with a shiver and
a ahudder they would all put for their
respeetive quasrters, where they would is
cower over a handful of embers and in ,
cold-storage acooents give utterance to w
their several and private opinions of l,
American weather. It is really a won
der that there ha" not been a greit e
many deaths amnong -the thinly-clad in
people of the Plaisance, so inhospitable o
and severe has been the spring season. -
Some of the people have been compelled f
to return to their native lands on se- f
count of illness and homesickness t
brought on by bad webther. a
As the season advances the grounds lu
take on fresh beauties in the region of ri
the Horticultural building, and the m
wooded island in the center of the tl
lagoon offers increased attractions. c,
This island is a perfect beauty spot and tl
is much sought by couples who prefer a as
quiet stroll apart from the thickly tt
peopled walks of the grounds. It is
about fifteen acres in extent and is the el
only vestige of natural ground remain- f,
ing in the park. The lagoon separates g
it from the main land, from which it is c
approached by several beautiful p
bridges, all surmounted by fine pieces a
of statuary taken from the wild life of t
the forest The island is to present t_
some fine work in the shape of land- t
acape gardening, and flowers from all s,
lands will soon be blooming in its beds. t1
The crowning glory of the place is to e
be a rose garen, where fifty thousand g
plants of over two thousand varieties a
will stand in graceful grouping. On a
this island are the Japanese temple, the o
New South Wales brush hut and the c
Roosevelt log cabin. c
Another favorite resort of visitors is p
the lake shore. The splendid prome- a
nade is a restful change from the some- a
what difficult round of sight-seeing. t
Here one may stroll at leisure beside a
the blue waters of the lake and quaff v
the refreshing breezes, or, if not averse a
to sitting on the stone embankment, f
take a squat and view the lake craft as a
they come and go. This latter seems t
to be a favorite position with some, and l
it is no uncommon sight to see a spoon
ing couple with their faces turned sea
ward drinking in the beauties of the
scene. 1
The lake pier is another much-sought r
point of vantage. From it may be ob; r
tained a splendid view of the fair build- f
ings and the lake. In the warm days I
of summer, which we have every right r
to expect will come sooner or later, g

)DED ISLE. -
our ardor perpetually dampened, this
pier will afford a cool retreat from the
glare of the white buildings. Here the
boats unload their passengers, and this
also will furnish a very taking subject
for contemplation. On this pier, which
extends about a block out into the
lake, just south of the grand entrance
to the lagoon, there is a movable side
walk which takes people its entire
length. This in itself is a unique fea
ture, and one that will command a large
patronage.
Aside from the points named there
s are a number of other choice spots
which will be much frequented by those

a great buildings of the fair.

That the fair as an exhibition is

by its greatest enemies. Men and news

e years and predicted a great and humili

Among the more than a hundred dif
ftrent congresses to be held during the
world's fair, under the auspices of the
world's .congress auxiliary of the Co
lumbian exposition, the one that stands
out unique and alone, having no prec
edeat in the history of such gather
ings, will tbe the world's youths' con
gress, which will convene on July 17
and hold three half-day sessions. The
fact of its having no precedent, so far
from militating at all against it, seems
to be in its favor, as something like
a general feeling prevails that this Co
lumbian year should mark theoinaugu
ration of some new and decided move
ment looking toward the enlistment of
the youth of America along lines cal
culated to most rapidly develop in
them lofty sentiments of patriotism
and decided notions of what constitutes
truest citizenship.
Delegates to this congress may be
either boys or girls, and are drawn
from the grammar and high school
grades of the public schools in every
county in the United States and of the
public, private and parochial schools of
all foreign countries, though confined
to the ages between thirteen and twen
ty-one yeays. In Chicago the work was
taken up with great enthusiasm in the
schools under the recommendation of
the board of education, and nearly
every school already has its delegate e
enrolled. Most of these delegates
were chosen by an essay contest in the
several schools, and it was hoped by the
committee having this congress in
charge that all the delegates could be
chosen in this way; but it is now so im
portant that the names of these repre- I
sentatives of their several schools
should be in the hands of the commit- 1
tee at the earliest possible time that 1
this committee urges teachers every
where to at once appoint in their
schools a delegate and an alternate and
forward their names, with age, county.
name of school and post office address,
to the secretary of the committee. F.
Frederick Bliss,World's Congress Head
quarters, Chicago.
Teachers everywhere are at liberty to
send names, and if from any county a
larger number is received than that to
which its population entitles it, the com
mittee will select the proper number
from those first received. To insure the
full quota from each county, the com
mittee would be glad if names of dele
gates and alternates were sent from
every school No teacher should fail
to make the appointments simply be
cause none of the young people can at
tend, for some of the benefits of the
enterprise are realized in the mere honor
and pleasure the students feel in their
appointment.
Requests have been sent to the- min
isters of education in all foreign lands
to convey the committee's invitation to
the youth of their several countries,and
asking for their appointment in the
same ratio and on the same terms as in
this country. Replies are being received
from these constantly. It is not ex
pected that any large number of the
youth of foreign lands can actually be
in attendance, but their appointment
and the publication of their names in
the final reports of the gathering would
be them a matter of quite pardonable
pride, and the certificate of their dcle
gateship would be a highly-prized
souvenir of the Columbian celebration.
It is hoped that every teacher reading
this will immediately act in the matter,
and that young people who are attend
ing school will bring it to the attention
of such of their teachers as have not
made the appointments.
WOMEN TO ACT AS GUIDES.
The Corps of Twenty-Five to Be Selected
at Olnce.
There will be twenty-five wlgen
guides altogether and there are
several hundred applicants. The ex
amination and appointment will be
conducted by officers of the board of
lady managers.
No uniform has yet been decided upon
for the women guides, and it is proba
ble that they will not be required to
wear any, owing to the difficulty of
getting more than one woman to agree
upon what would be proper and becom
ing.
According to a member of the board
of lady managexs the women to be em
ployed must be intelligent, well
dressed, well educated-linguists in
fact-and good-looking. For these ac
complishments each woman employed
is to get the paltry salary of thirty dol
lars per month. Members of the board
are endeavoring to have this sum in
creased. Failing in that they will try
to influence, all the women to decline
such work for such pay.
Lieut. Foote, who has charge of the
corps of exposition guides, has eighty
fiveon his staff. Thecorps willbe in uni
form,and the stations will be established
with headquarters in: the Service build
ing. Stations will be located at the
terminal railway station, the pier, Six
tieth street entrance, government pier,
west center of Mlanufactures building,
and other places not yet decided on.
All of these stations will be connected
with the main office in the Service
building, and when there is a special
demand for guides at any one station
reinforcements can be sent from the
others
The rates for services of guides have
been fixed at fifty cents an hour for a
party not to exceed five.
