OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
WILL SEND CARDS.
Hello, Daddy Jim:—Will you
please make room in one corner for a
little country girl? lam a little girl,
thirteen years old. lam going to
school now, and am in the fourth
grade. My teacher’s name is Mrs.
Carrie Moss; I like her very much.
My papa takes The Jeffersonian and
Magazine, and thinks they are great
papers. I will answer Bertie Moon’s
riddles: First a well, second a news
paper, third cotton. Now I will ask
one : I have a mouth, but never
speak; have a bed, but never sleep;
my way is rough, and where I go was
the same a thousand years ago. If
some one will answer this, I will
send them a pretty post-card. If I
see this in print, I will come again
some time. —Your little friend, Ola
Hairston, Canon, Ga., Rt 4.
NO ROCKS: NO SORE TOES.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here comes a
little South Georgia boy to join your
band. lam eight years old. lam in
the third grade. My teacher’s name
is Miss Agnes Mizelle. I like to go to
school very much. My papa takes The
Jeffersonian, and doesn’t think he
could get along well without it.
Mamma likes to read it, too. We live
about a mile from Omega. Both of
my grandfathers live there, and they
take the Magazine and The Jeffef
sonian. They sure do praise Mr.
Watson. W T e moved to this country
four years ago from Middle Georgia.
I like here better than I did up there,
for I dont have any rocks to stump
my toes on. I have two sisters older
than I am, and one brother younger.
I think the answer to Weaker Ter
rell’s riddle is the letter L. I will
ask a riddle: First it is white, then
it is red, three days old, and then it
is dead. With love to Daddy Jim, I
will close. —J. D. Mangham, Omega,
G a. .
RIDDLES AND ANSWERS.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here I come
for the first time. I live in the coun
try, on the public road, five miles
east of Ochlocknee, and nine miles
north of Thomasville. Next I will
tell you about our new school build
ing: it is painted white, is situated
on the public road, and is surrounded
by beautiful oak trees. My teacher’s
name is Cousin Sadie Chastain. I like
to go to school very much. I am in
the fourth grade, and I am eleven
years old. I have light hair, fair
complexion and blue eyes. Papa takes
The Jeffersonian, and we all like to
read it very much. I am going to
ask some riddles: Big at the bottom
and little at the top, something in the
middle goes flippety-flot. Another
is: Has ten thousand teeth, and has
no mouth. I will answer Maud
Scott’s riddle: it is a man walking a
bridge with a bucket of water on his
head. I’ll close and see if this reaches
the waste basket; if it doesn’t, I will
come again sonn.—Theo. Jones, Och
locknee, Ga., Rt. 2.
CAME FOR A CHAT.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l have just fin
ished reading your letters and en
joyed them very much, and thought
I would knock for admission to chat
with the Jeffs. I am eleven years
old and am going to school, am in
the fifth grade. My teacher’s name
is Miss Hattie Coleman; she sure is
a good teacher. Papa thinks Mr.
Watson is a great man. I will close
by asking some riddles: What is it
that goes all around the house and
makes but one track? What is it
that comes to the door, but don’t go
any further.—Yours truly, Mamie
Lewis, Warthen, Ga.
RIDDDLES FROM TENNESSEE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—As I saw my
first letter in print, I will write again
to ask some more riddles, for I do
enjoy asking them: (1) Brothersand
sisters have I none, but that man’s
Obe Jeffersonian.
father is my father’s son. (2) Why
are a mule and an egg alike? (3)
Why is a nickle like a rooster on a
fence? (4) How are a tree and a
hog alike? Well, one answered my
riddle right; the fuss is right, and
the shadow is wrong. Hoping to see
this in print.—Virgie Lee Wagner,
Rt. 6, Lewisburg,,Tenn.
PLENTY OF ROOM.
Dear Daddy Jim:—ls there room
for another little brown-eyed- girl?
I am eight years old. My birthday
is on the 10th day of June. Papa
takes The Jeffersonian, and I enjoy
reading the Post-Card Club. I will
answer Sarah Ponder’s riddle: it is
an umbrella; and Flossie Jackson’s
was a cow bell. I will ask some rid
dles: What is it that has a marble
wall as white as milk, lined with
skin as soft as silk. Within a foun
tain, crystal clear, a golden apple
doth appear; no bolts, no bars; yet
thieves break in, and steal the gold
that lies within. What is it that if
you cut it at both ends it grows long
er? As this is my first time I will
close, with best wishes to Daddy Jim
and the club.—Lou Ella Perdue, Rt.
1, Box 15, Alamo, Ga.
ONE FROM ALABAMA.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here I come
for the first time. Am going to
school, and am in the sixth grade.
We have three teachers: Prof. N. M.
Smith, Prof. J. S. Benson, and Miss
Alta Wilson; I like them very much.
My papa takes both Jeffersonians,
and thinks they are the best papers
in the world. I will answer a riddle
that Weaver Terrell wrote: It is a
letter L. I will ask one: As round
as a biscuit, busy as a bee, prettiest
little thing I ever did see. Good-bye.
Hoping to see my letter in print.—
Freeman. Wilson, Rt. 1, Section, Ala.
A GIRL AND A WAGON.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here comes
tw sisters from Georgia. Our papa
takes The Jeffersonian, and we sure
do like to read it, especially the Post-
Card Club. Papa has him a Watson
knife, and thinks it is the grandest
knife ever was; calls it his Sunday
knife. Papa and brother Harvey
went to Idlewild to hear Tom Wat
son speak. We live nine miles from
the city of Wrightsville, in Johnson
county, and one mile from New Home
church. We have a fine school, about
two hundred yards from the church.
We go to Sunday-school every Sun
day. The school-house has three
school rooms, and one Mason’s room
up-stairs. Prof. Bob Sumner, of
Wrightsville, Ga., and Miss Laura V.
Parker, from Wadley, are our teach
ers, and we dearly love them. As
this is our first time, we wttTTlose by
asking a riddle: What makes a girl
and a two-horse wagon so much
alike?—Nevada and Vettie Perry,
Rt. 3, Wrightsville, Ga.
HURRAH FOR ALL.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Will you admit
a Georgia girl to join your page? I
have blue eyes, light hair, fair com
plexion, am five feet tall, and weigh
one hundred and six pounds. I live
on a farm of one hundred and fifty
acres, which has two dwellings on it,
near the town of Fairburn. How did
you all enjoy Valentine’s day? My
papa takes The Jeffersonian, and
thinks there is no other paper like it,
and is a great admirer of Mr. Wat
son. lam not in school now. How
many of you girls like to cook? I
like it all right, and have lots of it to
do, for my mother is sick. Daddy
Jim, you and the writer ought to have
been down here on the 11th; every
thing was covered with ice, and it
was a beautiful scene. I think the
answers to Maud Scott’s riddles are:
(1) air, (2) a pot, and (3) the moon.
I will ask a question from the Bible:
How many of the children of Israel
that started from Egypt reached the
promised land, and what were their
names? I will send a card to all
who answer this question. Say, girls
and boys, don’t you think Daddy Jim
is a good old fellow to read and print
the letters that he receives? I think
he is. I think Mr. Watson is rather
kind to us to let us have a page in
his paper. Hurrah for Mr. Watson,
Daddy Jim and all the cousins. I will
ring off.—Willie Lizzie Stone, Rt. 2,
Fairburn, Ga.
ENJOYS READING THIS PAGE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here comes a
little country girl to join your happy
band. My papa takes The Jeffer
sonian, and I enjoy reading the chil
dren’s page. My mamma went to
school to Mr. Watson at Little Horse
Creek in Screven. I go to school
every day. lam in the fourth grade.
My teacher’s name is Lonnie Ziegler.
I have two sisters and two brothers.
I thought I would answer Bertie
Moon’s riddle. The first is a well;
the second is a newspaper; the third
is a white dog running a white cow
out of a white cotton patch. I want
to ask you a riddle: What is it that
goes all around the house and makes
but one track?—With best wishes to
The Jeffersonian, Cassie Bolton,
Zeigler, Ga.
SOME BIBLE QUESTIONS.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come
again. I have written once before,
but it wasn’t in print. I have five
sisters and one brother. Am ten
years old; have brown eyes, dark
complexion and am four and one-half
feet tall. I will answer Florence
Smith’s two questions, and will ask
two. The first was, how old was
Moses? Moses was 120 years old.
(2) At what place did be die? He
died in the land of Moab. How
many days and how many nights was
Moses on the mount? What is the
shortest chapter in the Bible?—Your
friend, Ida Bloodworth, Cairo, Ga.
If you have any spare time, and
want to make a little extra money,
drop a card to The Jeffs, Thomson,
Ga., and we will tell you how.
