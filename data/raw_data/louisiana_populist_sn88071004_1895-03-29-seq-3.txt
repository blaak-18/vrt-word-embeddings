New Courthouse.
D)on't misrepresent us by saying
we oppose buihltug a new Court
house, If the old one can't be re
paired, for we do nIot. So far as
we can tell the old house is dan
gerous, but we do think it can be
repaired, or a new one built with
out rai.ling the tanes ?f the peo
ple.
We cite `Winn parish for an ex.
ample. A $10,000 house is con
tracted for, and the police jury
have promised to coimplete it aw;l
pay for it without raiising the taxes
one cellt, save ant itlt·tase inl the
assessment of merlchauhtable piine
lands, which will not affect the
residents at all. Now, if Winn can
do this on an aissessinent of less
than a million, we certaInly ought
to do better with over 3 millions.
Do what you've told the farmers
to do--economize.
A Concert.
Preparations are being made for
a concert at the Comus Club Hall
on Friday, April 19th, for the ben-t

This entertainment promises to

the year, while the purpose fr
which it is given should commend

But Two Parties.
L
An intelligent man can now see ý
that the next national campaign
will be waged between two parties
only-the People's party and the A
Plutocratic party. All so-called
third and fourth parties will be
but subdivisions of the two lead- r
ing parties.
The war of ballots nill be be
tween Populists and Plutocrats.
The Populists will have for allies,
B all honest silverites, prohibition- a
- ists and socialists; while the Plu
I tocrats will be divided into Demo
t crats, or Southern Plutocrats and
Republicans, or Northern Pluto
i crate, which divisions have already
been merged into one party when
e ever necessary to beat their com
mon enemy-the Populists; and
these divisions will be aided by
Goldbugs, Wallstreeters, Million
h airs, Rothschilds and John Bull.
11 It will be a mighty contest be
tween manhood and money-be
u tween principle and policy, between
freedom and slavery.
It will be the severest test to
which the integrity of the human
race has for centuries been - sub
* jected. The noble attributes of
e the soul will be put on their mer
it its against the evil passions of
mankind. All the powers of dark
ness will be hurled against the
battlements of righteousness.
Sons and daughters of the Rev
olution, where will you be
d found We know where your
1- sainted mothers and your heroic
10 sires stood. Will you desert
i them Willyou stain their glo
LI rious records by joining forces
ad with Britik gold--their mortal
I't enemy?
" May God give as wisdom to see
the right sad manhood to defend it.
