HON. THOS. E. WATSON AS A
WORKER.
A new book from the pen of Hon.
Thomas E. Watson has just been is
sued by the Neale Publishing com
pany, to take its place in the libra
ries of the country with the other
works of this Georgia author. The
new book, “Waterloo,” forms one of
the historical series of Mr. Watson’s
works, and is a sort of sequel to
“Napoleon,” as that work is to “The
Story of France.” As everybody
knows, the historical writings of Mr.
Watson are divided into two classes,
one relating to French History and
the other to American history. In
the latter class it must be remem
bered that the last chapter of his
“Life of Andrew Jackson” was pub
lished only a few months ago, in
The Jeffersonian Magazine. At pres
ent Mr. Watson is believed to be en
gaged in an amplification of his “Ro
man Sketches,” in which he will take
up successively the leading characters
of Roman history.
Besides these historical works, Mr.
Watson has written other books, the
charming story, “Bethany,” a mix
ture between biography and historical
romance and his books on political
subjects, all together forming quite a
library by themselves.
However much Georgians may dif
fer in their appreciation of Thomas
E. Watson, there are none that do not
admire his writing’s. Unfortunately,
on account of his political aetivi
ties, his own people are widely di
vided in their appreciation of him,
and while there are many in whose
eyes he is the greatest man living and
who in their hearts honor him above
all men, there are others who as
heartily dislike him and who assign
him to a low place among dema
gogues. Perhaps it could not be oth
erwise in regard to one of his decid
ed view’s and strenuous activity in
contending for them, and who has
the courage to array himself against
the powers that be. Because of this
independence and restless activity it
will probably be Mr. Watson’s fate
during life to meet bitter antagonism
and personal enmity among his own
people, and he who above all else
would prize the undivided, heartfelt
appreciation of all his people, will go
through life encountering violent op
position and the harshest and often
unjust criticism. Only when his life
work shall be ended, when the active
brain shall have ceased to think and
the busy hands be stopped by death,
w r hen he shall have ceased to be an
active force in the great drama of
life, will it be possible for all men
to do full justice to his work. And
then will Georgians agree, as they
cannot do now, that among the many
illustrious sons of this grand old
state, Thomas E. Watson was one of
the greatest.
On one thing all will agree now, and
that is the wonderful amount of work
of which he is capable. For two
years he has been publishing a weekly
paper and a monthly magazine, doing
on them not only all the editorial
work, but personally looking after the
many wearisome details of the busi
ness management. This would seem
to be work enough for one man, and
there are few who would be willing
to shoulder so much. But in addition
he has. been for months conducting
a political campaign, making speeches
almost daily all over the state, trav
eling thousands of miles to reach the
various counties, and all this time
conducting the extensive correspond
ence incident to the management of a
national campaign. In addition to
this he has very extensive farming
interests, with which he keeps in clos
est touch and which he directs per
sonally.
It is simply amazing, then, when a
man doing all this work, and in the
midst of it, finds time to write and
publish historical works, literary pro
ductions which of all others require
the most research and the greatest
care in writing. Yet “Waterloo”
has just been issued from the press.
A prodigious worker, Mr. Watson
is, without a doubt. Not his most
determined opponents will deny this.
His dearest enemies will freely and
gladly admit it, and wonder how it
is possible for a man of Mr. Wat
son’s almost frail physique and far
from robust health to do such an
amount of work.—Augusta Herald.
THIS IS OF INTEREST TO OUR
READERS.
They Tell the “Appeal to Reason.”
From a ROOSEVELT MAN.
I was a Republican in politics un
til I received the issue of the Appeal
for the 12th. That article about
Taft and the Catholic church seemed
to be the last straw on the camel’s
back, in my case, as I became a So
cialist on the spot. I would rather
give my vote to the dogs than give it
to the present representatives of the
Republican party. No. 667 fell like
a bomb shell in this city, so far as
I can find out. It seems to be the
topic of conversation. —Peter J. Lew
is, Scranton, Pa.
From a REPUBLICAN.
I wish to congratulate you upon
the two last issues of the Appeal, in
exposing the relation of the Catholic
hierarchy and the Republican leaders.
I had long suspected that very thing.
While I have always been a staunch
Republican, after reading your arti
cle it took me less than five minutes
to decide not to vote for Taft. An
other prominent lifelong Republican
informed me he had made the same
decision. —J. H. Featherman, Wads
worth, Ohio.
A STRAY COPY.
By chance a copy of the Appeal
No. 667 has found its way into my
hands. I have read it with interest.
It is in such demand that the copy
has been almost worn out. —J. W. H.
Underwood, Cleveland, Ga.
From a CATHOLIC.
I am glad to see at least one pa
per in this country strike back at
Rome instead of continually warding
off blows. I was born and reared in
the faith, while they were a religious
body, but when they adopted politics
and neglected their creed I cut loose,
©b* Jeffersonian
when I read of their blessing the
guns and at the same time preaching,
“Thou shalt not kill.” —Geo. Can
field, Cleveland, 0.
Note —This article on the Catholic
Hierarchy was, as is well known to
Jeffersonian readers, one of Mr. Wat
son’s editorials in the June magazine
last summer. The June edition hav
ing been practically exhausted, and
so many, many calls being constantly
sent in for it, it has been decided to
reprint the article in the December
magazine. /
The “Appeal to Reason” over
looked giving credit, as sometimes oc

THE WOMAN’S HANDICAP.
By Constance Fuller Mclntyre.
It is sometimes instanced, in sup
port of the not altogether exploded
theory of a man’s having more brains
than a woman, that, although music,
painting and poetry are fields espe
cially her own, no woman has ever as
yet attained to the very foremost
rank either as painter, poet or com
poser.
Why is this? Are the men brainier
than we, after all? It always seemed
to me rather idle to compare the sex
es as such, and yet a remark like the
above sets one to doing it in spite of
oneself. Can it be that women,
though doing thoroughly first-class
work along these lines, work that
compares not unfavorably, perhaps,
with that of their masculine contem
poraries, are yet constitutionally de
barred from attaining supreme excel
lence ? I cannot altogether believe
it, and yet there is no controverting
the above statement.
It seems to me that the reason of
it lies just in this —the inevitable
handicap of being a woman. What
ever a man takes as his business or
profession he can devote his best en
ergies to, comparatively unhampered.
He is poet, painter or musician first
—husband, father or son afterward.
With a woman conditions are re
versed. Just in proportion as she
approaches perfection she is wife,
mother or daughter first —musician,
painter or poet afterward. Thus,
while his chosen.work is paramount
with a man in most cases it cannot
be more than a side issue with a wom
an, to which she may manage to de
vote only a little more than the fag
end of her time left over from house
keeping, mothering, sewing and all
the thousand and one things a woman
must do.
iShould someone object here that
she can relegate these matters, either
wholly or in part, to another, I think
one may fairly claim that in nine
hundred and ninety-nine cases out of
a thousand that would be practically
out of the question.
With exceptions so few as to be
countable on the fingers of one hand
genuises have always been poor —
financial recognition arriving too late
to practically count greatly in their
development. Now it may be ques-
tioned whether poverty is a handicap
at all to a man, the additional incen
tive to hard work which it entails
more than counterbalances the lack
of external advantages. But with a
woman poverty invariably means a
tremendous handicap in anything she
undertakes of an artistic nature. It
means that even where she relegates
the actual making and mending of
her own and perhaps her children’s
clothes, to another, she must still fill
up her mind with planning them,- pur
chasing them, making an attractive
appearance herself, keeping her house
tidy, planning meals and the advan
tageous expenditure in detail of her
income. All of this must in the na
ture of things swallow up time and
energy. We all know that unless de
tails that must be attended to are
kept on the mind they will be forgot
ten.
Now, a masculine genius may be as
absent-minded, untidy about looking
after his clothes and belongings, as
blind to mere details, as he pleases,
and yet it will be (provided he is
really more or less of a genhis) in
dulgently put down to the amiable
idiosyncrasies of genius. All this,
however, in a woman, be she never so
brainy, would be unpardonable. She
realizes this, and, consequently, must
give a considerable proportion of her
time to all that a man comfortably
ignores or leaves to his wife.
While the bachelor girl who has
chosen, for the sake of art, to remain
single, at any rate during the best
years of her life, is not handicapped
in anything like the same degree she
would be if married and a mother,
she still, nevertheless, handicapped,
even today, in a not inconsiderable
degree by her sex. And although, as
we all know, it. happens that some
among the most highly gifted, men
tally and physically, men elect to re
main single, yet in estimating percent
ages, it will be conceded that, say,
ninety per cent of the flower of her
sex are probably married by the time
they are twenty-five or thirty. There
fore, the exceptions to this heavy ar
tistic handicap are only a small per
centage among the women who might
possibly develop artistic genius.
In counting over the married
couples among one’s friends and ac
quaintances, balancing the collective
brains of the husbands against those
of the wives, it is not (at any rate,
in the writer’s experience) the latter
side of the scale that tilts upward.
But even granting, for the sake of ar
gument, that other people’s private
scales should tip the balance in the
same way, we are only “forrarder”
by the discovery of a high average,
which does not necessarily include the
supreme height.
Perhaps the very fact of the thou
sand and one details as well as im
portant matters, that a woman must
attend to develops her brain along
general lines while it reduces the val
ue of her attainments along any one
line, in this age of specializing, ren
dering her incapable of scaling the
uppermost heights, before the day is
done. —The Housekeeper.
