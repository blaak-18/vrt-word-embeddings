MITCHELL'S REPORT.
Decument Deals With a Numnber of Sao
Jects Relating to Miners.
Indianapolis, Jan. 21.--The first
thing on Tuesday's programme of the
Miners' National Wage convention was
the reading of John Mitchell's annual
report. The convention met promptly
at 9 o'clock with 900 delegates in their
seats.
In his report President Mitchell
said: "For the justice of our claims I
have no fear of the outcome."
The fact that strikes are becoming
less numerous, Mr. Mitchell said, is
due to tne operation of joint agree
ments. Local and general strikes, he
said, occurred more often in districts
where operators refused to recognize
their organization, or treat with its ac.
credited officers.
Mr. Mitchell continued: "With each
succeeding year relations he.-ome more
cordial between olierators '.aid mine.s
in those districts where tr. :!ýe s r-',m .
ments exist and bond m:: :-i c: ,"
dence and r"spect have per- i'Ub1y in
creased. 1 uat the busine>., relation
ship now existing will continue and
grow as time goes on is my earnest
hope and confident expectation."
Concerning incorporation of trade
unions Mr. Mitchell submitted an opin.
ion by Clarence Darrow of Chicago, at
torney for the miners before the strike
commission, In which the following
sentences occur: "Demand for incor
poration of trade unions is the last
trelich of those who oppose organized
labor. It is impudent and presumptu
ous. No friend of trade unionism ever
believed in it or advocated it or called
for it. It is demanded by those inter
ests and those enemies who have used
every means at their command to op
pose trade unionism to counteract its
influence or to destroy it. How labor
organizations shall manage their own
stairs is not the business of corpora
tions or employers. This new demand
for incorporation labor unions is not
only unjust and unreasonable, but it
Is impudent and insulting to the last
degrie."

There is a great deal in surface at

never fail in being as pleasing in a

right place, with the gift or grace of
toach that brings in individual expres
sion.
There seems to be a growing and far
reaching desire for less of the conven
tional and more of the original In our
homes. One example of the latter
serves as an object lesson and an in
centive to every oct who sees it. Even
where the newer modes of furnishing
have not appeared there Is still -a re
markable Interest arising from and
stimulated by the literature of the day.
The practical questions, however, that
vary with every house and the differ
ing conditions of Its occupants are a
matter of experience and innate or ed
ueated taste.
Experiments are fascinating to the
inexperienced and fully as delightful
to those well equipped with knowledge.
A beginning may always be made in
Improving the Interior of the house.
and in starting out with the simplest
kind offuarnishing it is well to have In
mind a general and more extenalve plan
that may gradually be acecomplished.

SKIBT AND COBSET COVER.
This is a durable lace and rather more
showy than the other, but it is not so
dainty.
Drawers are nearly all made very
short. reaching no farther than the
knee and trimmed with umbrella
flounces, each being ruffled all they
will hold. These garments for all of us
are now made almost like those worn
by the skirt 4ancers as far as refling
Is concerned. Umbrella ruffles are
made with one deep shaped flounce.
and on this is set another. and this is In
turn decorated with several rows of
-lace or line embroidery gathered on
fall. Pretty bows of naftrow ribbon are
set at the aldep. I may also mention
the faCt that the top is ftted closelj so
that nothlng may Interfere with the
-set of r close fttting dress.
Next comes the eoret, Waist and

i~ s. what else to make it a perfect
fsff it is clear that the petticoat should
be less ornamental than the dress, and
so the skirt will lb3cut with a train to
snatain the 'train of the dress. The
flonees to the petticoat are made of
plain batiste rufles simply hemmed.
There are many of them, some of them
being only on the lower part of the
train. Several of the prettiest of the sets.

drawers, corset cover and petticoats all
made after thbe same design, have rows
of Inaertion and beneath that ribbon in
a delicate shade ,f color. Some have
blae-velvet run in troutrou style. Tiny
bunehes of baby and Tom Thumb rib
bop are put on these dainty undergar
ments and add infinitely to their at
treetlveness.
For several years women have dis
earded chemises as unnecessary, Wear
ing only their union suits of fine flan
nel undergarments in cold weather and
gause vests in'warm days. This made
the corset waist a necessity, and to still
further simplify things it was joined to
a sort of skirt. This has now given
place to the corset slip petticoat for
many occasions and the returdf to the
old chemise in all other cases. The
chemises of this season are marvels of
daintiness, and all are made with a
'strong eyelet hole on each side of the
shoulders ho that a bit of ribbon can be
run through and fastened there, antu
that forms the sleeve, for all these
pretty garments are cut "sack shape."
In this way, If the owner wishes to
wear a low dress, all she has to do Is
-to ,onte the ribbons and tuck t!;t part

ming Is put around the neck, only the
narrowest of fine edging.
The night robes are large and loose
around the shoulders and without col

the frost of the neck or V shaped, and
the rest of the. front may be as orna
