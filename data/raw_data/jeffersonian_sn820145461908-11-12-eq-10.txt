What Our American Farmers Want
Do they want to be deluded and
deceived? Do they want to be flat
tered, humbugged and plundered? Do
they want- a handful of speculators
and gamblers, headed by Armour, to
set pi ices upon the products of the
farm.’ Are they satisfied to let the
Armour gang fix these prices, first
low io farmers, then afterwards high
Io consumers? Do they want a still
smaller bunch of tariff barons to fix
a high tribute and a mighty tax upon
all the necessities and comforts of
life? Are farmers satisfied with the
present tariff prices on lumber and
farm machinery?
Xo, they are not satisfied. There
is a miuTitv rumble and roar of dis
content. Because of this, President
Roosevelt has appointed a commission
to inquire into the matter —to inves
tigate the complaints—to find out
what are the wants, wishes and needs
of American farmers.
This may be a wise step. However,
over $25,000,000 are already appro
priated and spent by the General Gov
ernment and different States annually
to teach farmers. Tn addition to these
gigantic appropriations, farmers pay
at least $25,000,000 more every year
in subscript ions to about 300 exclu
sively farm publications. Think of
ill Fitly millions yearly Io educate
farmers, ami yet Mr. Roosevelt thinks
still more should be spent.
\\ hat is this fifty million spent for?
Mas one dollar of it ever spent to ex
pose the tricks of the grain, tobacco
and cotton gamblers, fruit thieves and
live stock pirates? Was one single
dollar of it ever spent to devise a plan
or method whereby farmers, them
selves, might fix profitable and uni
form prices upon their products, con
trol marketing ami wipe out the crimi
nal gang of speculators and gamblers?
Xo. not a dollar. Was a penny of it
over spent to fell farmers what the
parcels rost is and how it would bene
fit them? TTow it would save them
robber express charges, if the rural
mail carrier gould bring him pack
ages, that he is now compelled to
hitch up and drive miles and miles
for? Was a penny of it ever spent to
tel] fanners about government tele
phones and telegraphs, so they could
be in touch with their neighbors and
the world at living and decent rates?
\\ as a dollar of it ever spent to teach
farmers about an honest government
savings bank, where they would be
protected and their deposits would
be safe?
What will this well-fed, portly and
aristocratic committee, consisting of
Professors Bailey, ’Wallace, Butter
held. Pinchot and Page, named by
Mr. Roosevelt, do? One thing is
quite sure. They will spend from
$•>,0(H).000 to $10,000,000 of public
lands. But will they dig up, and then
tell the facts? Will they explain
that the triumph of one, and the de
feat of another, political party was
not the cause of the last ten years of
marvelous activity, prosperity and

wealth? Will they remind the public,
that nations, like men, often prosper
and get rich from the hardships, mis
fortunes and sufferings of others?
Will they tell us that the English-
Boer, Spanish-American ami the Rus
sian-Japanese wars, created a great
demand for American farm products?
That hundreds of thousands of horses
and mules were bought for the Eng
lish-Boer war? That prices went from
S4O and SSO apiece to $l5O and S2OO
a head ? That pork, beef ami mutton
—wheat, corn and cotton —were also
in great demand? That Alaska gold
mines were also discovered? That the
new mines and old ones, too, poured
out tons and tons of the yellow meta] ?
That mining interests and all enter
prises developed wonderfully? That
everybody got busy? That banks
everywhere extended credit, credit,
credit without limit? That mon
ey became plentiful? That crops
were big and prices good? That bil
lions of foreign capital and wealth
came to American shores? That noth
ing like it ever occurred in all the
world’s history? That property dou
bled, quadrupled—and then some?
That American “patriots” jumped
into paying tremendous dividends up
on tens of billions of “hocus-pocus,”
humbug or watered stock? ’Will they
tell us some of these things?
Will they tell us that, while farmers
•—that is. the few farmers who own
land—got a little taste of this tre
mendous growth—enough al least Io
swell some of their heads most mighti
ly—that the Armour gang of specu
lators ami gamblers in farm products,
railroad and transportation com
panies, farm implement outlaws, the
coal, iron, lumber, sugar, whiskey and
insurance robbers, Standard Oil and
Wall street trust and banking institu
tions come in for the lion’s share?
That thev got enough not onlv to
swell their heads, but to swell their
thousands into millions and their mil
lions info billions?
Will this fat. sleek-headed, scholarly
committee tell us some of these
things? Will thev tell us that not
withstanding the billions and billions
of wealth (including watered stock)
rolled un during the past ten years,
that there are just as rnanv poor peo
ple now as ever? That 2.000,000 wage
earners are out of employment to
day? That there are over 3,000.000
tenants, with their families, on Ameri
can farms todav. who do not own one
single acre of soil? That those 3.000,-
000 farm tenants and 12.000.000 wago
earners, with their families, consti
tute about 75.000.000 of our popula
tion? That those 75.000.000 Ameri
can souls own less than one per cent
of the nation’s wealth Will
this high-toned committee of “farm
the-farmers” tell us some of these
things ?
Will they toll us that in Isso. wlum
the cornbbmri wealth of the notion
owned $4,000,000 000. or one billion
more than all other interests com
bined? That in Isoo. at the close
of a fortv years’ race, the combined
wealth of the nation was $80,000.-
000.000 out of which farmers owned
less than $15,000,000,000. while all
Jeffersonian
other wealth had reached over $65-
000,000,000? That farmers, starting
in $1,000,000,000 ahead, came out over
$50,000,000,000 behind in the race?
It’s my old head to a foot ball, that
this dignified committee will not tell
any of these facts. It’s dollars to
doughnuts that this commission,
“after due deliberation,” will send
out an “official” bulletin —the glad
tidings of great joy—announcing that
farmers not only" “own,” but are the
“kings” of earth. Pages of public
documents will eloquently set forth
the glory, wealth, grandeur, beauty
and “independence” of the life out
upon the farm.
If one-tenth of the taffy and flat
tery, of the slush and gush, dished up
and handed to farmers, was true or
even believed to be true, why don’t
the Armour gang of robbers, the faim
implement outlaws, Standard Oil pi
rates, the coal, lumber, steel, sugar,
cotton, tobacco and whisky thieves,
the railroad bandits and knaves of
Wall street, all abandon their careers
of infamy and crime, and move out
onto farms themselves?
Out West is the loco weed. When
grass gets short stock goes after this
weed and trouble begins. When a
steer gets a taste of it nothing else
goes, and he puts in the rest of his
time ('basing after the loco weed. The
more he eats the more he wants. It
does him no good, but a heap of harm,
(like cigarettes with a high-school
boy.) Everything is abnormal to that
steer. De steps and jumps high Io
gel over a stick on the ground. If
anything comes toward him, he falls
over backward. But he keeps hunt
ing for the loco weed, until death —
horrible as the death of a cigarette
fiend —ends his awful career.
Farmers of this country are being
fed on the loco weed of “prosperity.”
Tin 1 agricultural department, the agri
cultural colleges, farm papers and the
smooth, wire-pulling politicians are all
dishing it up, by wholesale, to farm
ers, who are eating and lapping it
down, and who are convinced that
there is nothing like it in the world.
Secretary Wilson's report shows
that farmers get more —by tens and
tens of millions —for a small crop
'than for a large one. But, swinging
the loco weed of prosperity, Mr. Wil
son hollers “big crops, big crops.”
The erv to the farmer is to raise
more and more of everything. Os
course you won't get so much for it.
Mi-. Farmer, but you should spend
your time and your money educating
your children Io produce more of
everything. Bui never mind about
prices. Let the speculator and gam
bler attend to that, because you won’t
have time, if you hustle from twelve
Io sixteen hours a day to keep up
with the procession of producers.
With a beneficent protective tariff,
and with such wise and patriotic
statesmen as Joe Gannon ami Stan
dard Oil Aldrich, to look after your
interests, how can you fail to be
prosperous, happy and contented ?
How can you help but crave for more
of the loco weed of prosperity?
If you like it, if you still hanker
fur more, the commission just ap
pointed will no doubt furnish yon
with an extra side dish.
