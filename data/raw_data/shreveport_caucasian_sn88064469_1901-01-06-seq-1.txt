An Excellent Combination.
The pleasant n'rth.d and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
iYvuP oF Fios, manufactured by the
CALIFORNIA Flo Syr.nu Co., illustrate
the valueof obtaining the liquid laxa
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to the
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub
stance, and its acting on the kidneys.
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the.
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remaey are obtained from senna and
other aromatic plants, by c method
known to the CALuFolnIA FIe SyRUP
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
effects and to avoid imitations, please
remember the full name of the Company
printed on the front of every package.

St. Josepb, Mo., January 6.-Last bu'
leLin gave lorecasta of storm wave to cross
c ýntLuent about 11 to 2b, warm wave 10 to
14, 0ool wave 1i to IT.
Cold wave will cros west of Rockies
1h, great central valleys 16 to 1$, Eastern
States 19. This will be one of the severest
c Id waves of the month but the month is
not excepted to average very cold.
About date ýt this bulletin temperature
will be rising in the upper Missouri valley
and this moderating wave will slowly ex
pand south and East till all the sontinent
e st et the Rookies is covered by it.
After a short setback toward colder thbl
moderating wave will resume its work and
thie time It will reach to a warm wave ast
tending to about the hihest temperature
of the eonth near 16th, lollowed by the
cold wave mentioned above.
The drop as temperature due on meridian
90 near 10 is noe expected 'o amount to a
o.ld wave. The United States weather
bureau doelse a cold wave in this way :
The temperature must tall twenty degrees
in twenty-tour hours and must go below
treesilg er below Sdegrees.
My caleulatleae have made it appear that
December and January would be very dry
monthe, not in every locality, but as an
verarro of the inhabited part of the North
Amoeriea eontia.etand that these months'
woul average warmer than usual. ho far
my esleulatises have been goon except
from 17T to 5 of Deoembej when it was
warmer sad drier thn indleated.
