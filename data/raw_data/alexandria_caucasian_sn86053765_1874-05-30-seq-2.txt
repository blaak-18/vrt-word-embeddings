BP We have been requested b,y
Mr. T. Crawley, Business Manager
* Th f pia " Association,
state that the peiformance that was
to have taken place last Thursday,
has been postponed on account of
the inclemency ot the weather un
til Monday the 1st of June. f
We wish to state upon our own
authority that the young men and
ladies who will appear on t&at (Oc
casion, have lost no time in making
the necessary preparations for the
general satisfaction of all who* 3
attend.
It is to be hoped that there will
be a crowded house, which will be
a gratification «to those who take
part in the performance, to know
that their services are appreciated
on this charitable occasion. As
they have always been ready, and
showed their willingness when call
ed upon, to do all in their power to
relieve the e wants of those who
know how to appreciate their ser
vices, and we take pleasure in say
ing, that on this occasion particu
larly, that they will be liberally re
warded at some future period.
CF The Natchitoches Kepubli
. can devotes over two columns of
its editorial space in a reply to an
article that appeared in the Cauca

ches. We propose to notice the re
ply in a future issue. We say to
the Republican now it is no excuse
for the misrule that prevails there,
some few Democrats implicated,
expose them.
OATS OF OFFICE.
Sometime since, the Opelousas
Journal referred te the oath of of*
flee required by the constitution to
be subscribed to by all officers be
five they entered upon the dis
charge of their duties, as a reason
why, there should not be a white
man's party, as the officers elected
on that issue could not subscribe
to the Constitutional oath. The
following is the oath :
I (A. B.) do solemnly swear, or affirm,
that 1 accept the political equality of all
men, and agree not to attempt to deprive
any person or persons, on account of race,
color, or previous condition, of any politi
cal or civil rights, privilege or immunity
enjoyed by any other class pf men, &c."
There is nothing in this oath that
we can not cheerfully subscribe to.
It is not proposed by those who be
lieve it to be a necessity to unite
the white people of this country in
to a political organization, in oppo
sition to negro incompetency, and
their effort to Afiricanize the State,
to deprive the negro - of any rights
that have been conferred upon him
by the constitution and the laws.
We do not seek to deprive hits
of his rfght to vote, to sit on thé
jury, and to hold office, nor any
right exercised by any other class
of men, but we believe to be a duty
of the white people of this State, to
make a'bold and determine^ effort
at the next election, to secure a
representation» of the honest tax
payers and property holders, to se
cure the reins of government from
the ignorant and depraved negroes,
and his carpet bag allies, who regard
power in the State government on
ly as a means ot gorging themselves
with public plunder.
The political issue of white and
black is not a new one in this State,
for tie negro from the earliest date
of his enfranchisement has used his
ballot, alone in the interest of
and for his race. His hatred of
the white race, and the exclusion of
the intelligent tax payers from of
lice, has been the ruling motive, and
will continue to be, so long as he
exercises the ballot. Iiis ignorance
and his hostility to us, blinds him,
to the best interest of both classes,
and our only hope of escape from
his rule of ruin and desolation is to
organize and unite, into a compact
political organization, the white
masses of Louisiana, and by supe
rior intelligence and activity, de
feat the negro party at the polls.
The negro has forced this issue °up
on us, and we must meet itr manful
ly and boldly, as there is no way of
escape from it. It may be as the
Opelousas Journal says, there is a
large number of respectable colored
men in favor of reform, and oppos
ed to the rule of the corruptionists
in this State. If that be the case,
we see no reason why they should
not co-operate with the white peo
ple, in their effort to secure good
honest and capable white men for
races, restore an honest and econ
omical administration of the gov
ernment', that will sécure the bles
sings of peace and prosperity to all
alike without refference to race or
color. If the white party should
elect a majority of the members of
the Legislature at the next election,
which is probable, there is nothing
in the constitutional oath that they
could not subscribe to. With more
propriety, the Journal might say
that, the negro could not subscribe
to the oath, for he has io the past
used his power to deprive the white
tax payers-and property holders of
representation in the State govern
ment, and has legislated with the
sole view ol perpetuating the polit
ical power of his race.
BT We call attention to the no
tice, in another column, the meet
ing to be held at the Town Hall, on
the 4th day of June—next Thurs
day—to take into consideration the
improvement of the Pineville Cem
etery. As the ladies have at last
taken charge of the matter, we have
strong hopes that something tangi
ble and in real earnest will be done,
to do away with the standing dis
grace of our parish. It.4 present
shameful condition demands some
speedy action in the premibes.

Our Pariah.
It is well known that the formers
ef this parish, have suffered as
much, if not more than any other,
parish in the State, from failure in
crops since the yeâr 1868.This
year this parish is fortunate in "es
caping the terrible calamity of an
overflow, and the great loss anil
suffering Incident thereto. The peo
ple although greatly reduced in
available meahs, annoyed and op
pressed in many ways, have exhib
ited an' energy and determination
to sncoeed this year, which is in
the highest degree commendable
and encouraging. The crops al
though planted with great care and
earlier than usual have, been .dam
aged by incessant rains, destroying
in many instances, the stahd.of
both cotton and corn. Many have
been forced to plant ovèr or
thought it safer to do so, and will
be, perhaps, benefitted by it. The
dry weather has been of great ad
vantage to the cotton plant which
is now growing rapidly—hnd the
farmer has taken advantage of this
dry season, to thoroughly cultivate
his crop. From many portions of
our parish we receive from our
planters the.gratifying intelligence
that the prospect for a good crop
this year,- notwithstanding, the ad
verse season is better, by far than
last -year. The recent rains on
Bayous Rapides,- Cotile and Boeuf
and the Pine Woods will greatly
benefit the growing crops, and en
coürage the farmer with new hope.
The sugar planter after repeated
failures, attended with great losses,
has. qiuse of gratulation, for the
prospect for a big success in tnis
branch of our agricultural industry,
is greater, than any year since the
war.
The present crop-will be made at
a small expense comparatively, less
than any previous one, by far, it
being the determination of all to
economise, and-do with as little as
possible. The merchauts have been
very slow 0 to make advances and
although 6 in some instances, great
want will be experienced, yet in the
end it will turn Out advantageous
ly to the farmer, forcing hin) to ex
ercise the most rigid economy—to
make a virtue of necessity, and
keep out of debt.
Under all the circumstances the
future of the people of Iîapides, is
as encouraging if not more so, than
any in Louisiana.
Profiting ^ the severe lessons
of the past, our farmers have learn
ed that they can become indepen
dent, only by raising everything at
home necessary for home consump-.
tion, and they can obtain help only
when they''first help themselves.
Let the wise policy, of our farming
community looking to their own
farms for the production of every
thing necessary for home consump
tion be inaugurated, and faithfully
pursued, and a few years only will
elapse before our former prosperity
will returiij and ours be a happy
and prosperous people.
There is a silver lining behind
the clond, and by the dint of perse
verance and a wise economy we
will live to see* it.
E^Tlie Ouehita Telegraph of the

7th inst., Col. Garrett was a pro
found lawyer, an able jurist, and
has been for maiiy years recogniz
ed as the head of the legal profes
sion in North Louisiana. As a gen

• That ' splendid packet the
steamer Bart Able „left our wharf
punctually at 12 31., on Wednesday
witji'a good trip of^passengers.
Among the number were ex-Go ®v\
T. O. Moore, Hon. James G. White,
Robert P. Hunter, Esq., who ha|e
gone to the Crescent City on busi
ness. We wish them a safe return.
GP A few days since,, we saw on
our streets the largest Catfish, ever
caught out of Red River. jj
Uli l
ot tha Corner Stone .off the
ew Episoopal Ofearah. '.
This interesting ceremony, which
owing to tike higlr wate*»the want
of mail fseilitiee &fi., wastxwtponed
some weeks ago,, was performed on
Monday last', and was witnessed by
a- large concourse of people from
town and country. The number of
ladies present was an evidence of
the interest taken in the matter.
At eleven o'clock A. M., the bean
tihri and impressive morning ser
vice ot the Episoopal- Church was
read in the Exehahge Hall r after
which the congregation moved in
procession, accompanying the Ma
sonic fraternity, to the site of the
new church. Arrived there, «? the
ladies .took shelter trom the heat of
the Sun jn the unfinished. building
and the Masons, under the leader
ship of the Deputy Grand Master
of the Grand Lodge, our esteemed
young friend, John M. Barrett Esq.,
arranged themselves around the
Corher Stone, which was placed in
the South East corner of the build
ing, having chizeled out in its cen
ter a recepticle for the box prepar
ed to fit it. The masonic ceremo
nies of the occasion were thus
opened, as we understand is always
the case in Masonic meetings, by
the reading of a prayer by the
Chaplain of the Oliver Lodge, Dr.
Henry St. John. This was follow
ed by the saying of the following
odej which was impressively ren
dered :
Dee|» in the quarries of the stone,
Amid vast heaps oi other rock,
In darkness hid, to artunknown,
found this rade aud shapeless block.
Now shaped by art, its roughness gone,
And fit this noble work to grade;
^ud lay it here, a corner stone,
Chosen and sure, in proper place.
o
Within this stone there lies concealed
What future ages may disclose,
The sacred truths to us reveal'd,
By llim who fell by ruthless foes.
On Him, this corner stone we build,
To Him, this edifice erect ;
And still, until this work's fulfill'd,
May heaven the workman's ways direct.
Then the present master of the
Lodge, than whom no more wortly
choice could have been made, our
amiable and courteous friend, Ed
ouard Weil Esq., was handed the
emblem of his office, 0 the square,
asid haviug measured the stone, he
reported that it was square, and
that the " craftsmen had performed,
their duty well." Like measure
ments and reports were made by
the Senior Warden, Mr. W. O.
Dam mon, with the rul© and by the
Junior Warden, Mr. Sol Hess, with
the plumb.
Then the cup of° corn, emblem
matic of " plenty " was poured on
the stone, followed by the cup of
wine, representative of " joy " aud
by the cup of oil, expressive of
peace." Preceding the pouring
of the corn, wine and oil, the sealed
tin box, containing a copy of the
bible prayer book aud constitution
aud by-laws of the* St. James Epis
copal Church, was exhibited and
its contents explained to the audi
ence, after which it was placed in
the niche in the block of stone.
The Masonic ceremony was then
concluded by the singing of the
following :
Now our social labors closing,
Homage of the heart we pay;
Each in confidence repbsing,
Kindest thoughts that ne'er decay.
Let us each, in Time's commotion,
Heav'nly light and truth implore:
Thus we'll pass life's stormy ocean,
Landiug ou a happier shore.
After which the Rev. A. N. Og
den delivered a short, but able and
eloquent address, and then the
whole ceremonies were concluded
with proper religious services. The
crowd dispersed much impressed
with the beauty and imposing na
ture of the services, and Masonic
ceremony of laying the corner stone.
CP* We have been blesseU with a
light and gentle rain, which will be
of great benefit to the planters.
We have had a real drought of five
weeks in this town, the gardens
and pastures have almost dried up.
A few only have a good supply of
vegetables from their own gardens,
but the rain that' has fallen, will
cause a general improvement in all
our gardens, and consequently a
plenty ot vegetables^

Tke Barbecue.
We omitted in oar lass toinake
any editorial notice of thefaabeçae
advertised in our column for the
13th of Jnne at or near Paulfc Storq.
We are very forcibly lemiaded of
the omission, by the Democrat on
•Wednesday. As to any " explana
tion, 4 we hare none to give ! The
advertisement is sufficiently explan
atory, when it states where it is to
be, when, and that "the political
issues of the day will be discussed
by able speakers." Who those
speakers'are to be, depeada s o ma,
what, upon contingencies. Capt.
James G.. .While J ms conaented to
be one, and there will be other rep
resentatives of the Rapides Bar
most probably.
The object of the barbecue and
speaking is to make a beginning of
thé campaign. .To commenoe to
awaken the people to the impor
tance of the political contest ot this
Fall, and primarily to eompare
notes as to be pursued by the white
people of the parish) the party -name
&c., &c.
That these things would have
suggested themselves to almost
any one, without the necessity of
any editorial comment on our part,
is what might have been reasona
bly expected. We will state far
ther, for the edification of any en
quiring mind, that the question of
organizing a white man's party,
under some name that will signify
the purpose of the organization,
will most certainly be discussed,
with what result we are not now
prepared to say, at the barbecue,
and that if the proposition meets
with favor there, that line of policy
will most probably be adopted in
this parish, as it has in St. Landry
already been adopted.
Trial Colfax Prisoners .—We
have now only one mail a week
from New Orleans, and this by
Monday boat. Hencd* the latest
news we have of the trial of the
Colfax prisoners was from the New
Orleans papers of the 23d inst.
Mr. Marr, counsel for the defend
ants, made a motion to strike out
certain counts lor the indictment?
on the ground that the court was
without jurisdiction to consider
them. This the court refused to do
as the prisoners had already plead
ed to the indictment, but left it
open tor them, as the only regular
way, to object to the introduction
of testimony to sustain the Courts*
Several witnesses have been exam
ined, and the testimony is about
the same as that of the last trial.
Associate Justice Bradley of the
United States Supreme Court is
sitting with .fudge Woods in the
trial of the case, which promises to
continue for several weeks. It is
impossible for us to give any correct
idea of the result, but wfe join the
whole people of this and adjoining
parishes, in the sincere wish, that
the political persecutors of our
friends, will signally fail in their
nefarious designs.
Since writing the above, we have
received papers of the 26th inst.,
from New Orleans. Examination
of witnesses Continue. There have
been several new ones who are tes
tifying at a round rate against the
prisoners. No new facts have how
ever, been elicited in this trial, that
were not brought out on the last.

Vigilance committees' are seldom or
ganisod in any place where equitable
laws exist and are properly inforced.
Vigilance committees spring into ex
istence when a oommunity, weighed
down by oppression, h a ra ssed to death
by every conceivable outrage, aad de
spairing of ali hope of redress tkrsigl
the ordinary and legitimate channels,
finally resolves to take the law in their
own bands aad mete ont justice to the
offenders and guilty parties. When a
people are driven to such desperation
as thus to aet for their own protection,
they are net apt to be intimidated or
in aoy way restrained by the idle
threats of the very parties whose
Crimes may have givea cause for sueh
an extraordinary organisation.
The propriety of organising a vigi
Iauee committee in this city has been
seriously discussed, and is now. en
gaging publie attention. The necessi
ty for sndi an organisation is found
in the fact that the people are without
any protection for life or property.
There is no respect for laws enacted by
a bogus and a fradulent Legislature.
There is nothing but contempt for the
officers who pretend to administer
them. *
They are.regarded as- usurpera and
impostors, and without any legal au
thority to enforce order or afford pro
tection. With this state of affairs,
then, it is not surprising to find the
people alarmed and taking stepa to
protect themselves. Self preservation
is the first law of nature, and if the
thieves, burglars and other offenders,
should wake np some morning and
find themselves suspended to a lamp
post by an indignant people, they may
attribrte their-ill-luck to the absence
of any law or legal officers under the
so called Kellogg Government. -
In connections with this aubject we
find a pertinent aud sensible article iu
the Louisiana State Register a Republi
can paper, and that fact, the extract is
all the more significant. Démocrate
are not the only onea who are disgust
ed with the corruption of the Republi
can party and the robberies perpetra
ted by its office holders. Many de
cent Republicans are beginning to
show signs of restiveness under the
galling yoke, and the oppressive taxa
tion. In speaking of vigilance com
mittee, the Register says :
The Republican would have its
readers believe that these proposed
committees are favored only by Demo
crats. This is a misrepresention. Re
publicans become outraged at bad
government and plundering laws, enac
ted exclusively for the benefit of the
law-makers eqnally as quick, if ont
quicker, than Democrats. People Will
not stand by without squirming, no
matter what their politics are and seo
their homes and business swept away
under a system of legalized robbery,
and the proceeds go in to the pockets
ot thoso who enact the statues to de
spoil them. It is contrary to laws that
are immutable, and thus prevail to the
lowest form of life, for even the worm
will turn on its persecutor, and battle
for fts right to live. The remedy for
vigilance committees is not-found iu
an executive threat to disperse them ;
neither in saving it is the work of the
Democracy for political effect; but it
is found in the enforcement of good
laws, economical government, and a
proper regard for the wishes aud inter
ests of the people instead of the office
holders. It requires no prophet to see
that if the present corrupt rings con
tinue to hold the prosperity of the city
and State in their remorseless grasp,
that no human power can prevent the
organization of vigilance committees
as the last resort of desperate men.

EP The Ouehita Telegraph of

damage done in the Ouehita Dis
trict by the overflow says :
Of actual suffering, there has been,
so far. less than wo looked for. Over
flowed people have, somehow, fonnd
means of subsistence, although many
of them fled from the water with not
three day's rations in their keeping,
and. have, besides, for several days,
been without 0 employment. But, all
