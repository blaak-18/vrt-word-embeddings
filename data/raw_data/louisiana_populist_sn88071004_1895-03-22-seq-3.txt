Calaminity Howlers.
Congress appointed a committee
at its last session to investigate the
causes of agricultural depression
in the United States.
Though composed of mein mrs
of the old parties the committee
made a report which is rich read
ing for Populists.
The old parties can howl calam
nity right well when they run up
with the practical side of life as
this committee seems to huve done.
The report is printed on another
page of this issue under heading of
"The Cause of Depression " The
article wcs clipped from the Picay
une, which paper credited it to a
Massachusetts committee, but that
Swas an error the 'Pic" delights to
, make. It is the report of a con
1 gressional committee of Democrats
and Republicans, and the most in
I teresting feature of it is that they
recommend as the only remedy,
r legislation in line as far as it goes
with the Populist platform, legis
lation which sensible people know
will never be obtained through
Seither of the old parties.
