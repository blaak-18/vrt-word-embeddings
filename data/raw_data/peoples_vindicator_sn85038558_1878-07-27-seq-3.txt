NtEw ORLEANS, July `20, I7?7s.
EDITOR OF VINDICATOR:
When I commllenced my correspond
ence with yon, I, of course, anticipated I
criticism, or even hitter complaint and
ldeniiciaitioiin. llistory teaches. that in
all ages and counlllltries no forut of govern
lment, no administrator of governmu nt. t
Ito abuse of power, nor neglect of duty
has ever failed to have supporters. It is
in the very nature of things that this
should be so, and the. more flagrant the
neglect, insincerity, weakness, or worse,
on the part of rulers, the more sensitive
are they to criticism, and the more ve
hement in praise or defense are the syco
phantic satellites who revolve around
thieta.
The object of the letters I have writ
ten you was to give expression to views
held not only by umy humble self, but by
large numbers of at least as pure, as in
telligent, and as patriotic citizens of Lou.
iniman as ay that can be found loung
ing around the seat of power, and there
by to possibly cause a check or change
in the conduct of things. I have never f
had an axe to grind for self or friend's,
and consequently have never been seen
beside the grindstone. BIt I am seltish
at last-my business, nmy little property,
the happiness of my family, depend on
good government, aind if the govern
i.uent is the best that good faith to the
whole people, stern opposition to class leg
islation, and reasonable political sagaci
ty can supply, I would never be heard
complaining or criticising. But if that
government is in any degree the reverse
of this. as long I care for self, family and
Stale, it will not be in the power of the
I satellites or the apolog sts of power, to
keep inc silent
I any this as prefatory to a reply to
a crarse atnd rude criticism of amy letters,
which appeared over the seinature,
"Justitia," in the New Orleans Picayune
of .June 30th tilt.
".lustitia" charges me, in his very first
R paragraph, with vehemently and unjustly
making charges against the Executive,
which are without foundation in fact,
and which flow from error or malied.
- He also says that I endeavor to bring
B the Executive into contempt by holding
t him responsible for all "the unfortunate
condition of affairs that prevailed in this
1 State tduring the first three months of his
1 incutbency."
All this in one paragraph.
Let tme reply to this paragraph before
f going farther.
Vehemence is defined by Webster as:
"Violence; ardor ; eagerness; fervor;
force; inmpetuosity; might."
Now, I will plead guilty to any or
all of these definitions save the first,
and I would not give a copper cent for
any m ,n who could not exhibit such
,qualities in what he conceived to be a
good cause. I repudiate the first defini
r tion-Ist, because there was no reason
why I should have been violent--2nd,
because there is not a violent word con
tained in my letters, at the same time it
must not he forgotten that there are
r causes in defense of which, or in the ad
vo,:acy and establishment of which, men
are distinctly called on to be violent, and
if they are not then violent they are
simply not men at all. Fide: the Con
e federate cause and the cause of the 9th
of January, in each of which instances
e our Executive showed his faith in vio
lence.
To charge me with injustice, or malice
n towards the Executive is more serious,
and I repel the charge as utterly gratui
tous and groundless. Let us see just
w, -h. I hL.a. .iA ism .. my letters that
can bear against the Executive.
First, in Letter No. 1, I state that the
Executive stopped short on the 9th day
e of January, of taking the State Hons
Sin which Packard was barricaded.
o through the same means he had adopted
Sfor taking the Supreme Conrt-viz:
. forte of arms. I condemn his policy-as
do auy number of as good men as Lou
f isiana holds and I go onto prove by
one of Packard's leading men, that
the theory of our military men-that the
position would have been carried with
r. out the firing of a gun-was correct. I
- say that that was the supreme mnoment
' of the crisis, and that we lapsed from
Smanly and approved aggression into the
,f low channel of huckstering high and
Sundying principles tir a half loaf of
bread
This is absolutely true. This is histo
ry, and the coarse denunciations of
S'Justitia" cannot alter it.
- Then I say, that on the night of the
I 3d of March, the opportunity for taking
e the State House again presented Itself,
but it was not availed of. This, also, I
d condemn as unwise, not sagacious, and
I have a right to say so without being
vulgarly charged with "error," "injue
tice" or "malice."
f I think that both Grant and Hayes
it would have been glad to see the State
e House taken; plenty of good men think
r as I do; we can think and say so with
Sout castig insult on the Executive, and
i iis an outrage that such expression of
political opinion should subject a gen
tleman to personal newspaper dennncia
Stion and derision.
In Letter No. 2, I charge that since the
" 9th of January, Conservatism, so-called,
Sin contradistinction to what this element
Shas been pleased to call "Extremism"
- has controlled the conduct of things. I
y go, tarther. I say that compromise, bar
. gain and sale, took the place of the muls.
ket.
f I have only to point again to the
a prominent part played by thle Louisiana
State Lottery in purchasing a legisla
Stive quorum, and to all the revelations
made, and being made, by Congressional
r investigatious, to the resolution extorted
' from our Legislature on the subject of
political persecutions or prosecutions,
* and to the act of or Ligtslature appro.
-priating money [$20,000 or $30 000] to
pay the Police that defended4aPekard
while he was barricaded, while many a
Spoor man who carried his musket on our
side, after the main day of strife, went
peanilese--I say, I have only to point to
these things as proof as strong as holy
writ, to all except those who do not
want to believe.
True, Inowhere visit this sin especially
e on the Executive; I speak Only in gene
V ral terms, and this from the most deli
cate of motives; but I do not shrink one
e line. If it is sought to place the burden
. wholly there, I can't help it. All I can
say is that I am sure, if I had been the
Exeentive, all these things could not
have been done under my neoe without
my knowing it, and they should not
' have been done if I did not approve it.
More, I repeat that if these things were
1- done with the approval of the Execu
d tive, I think he committed a grievous
a political blnnder, and this, I have the
Soinalienable right to say without incur.
to ring the displeasure, much less the coarse
denunciation of his political approvers.
Ii this same letter I go on to state the
e nine different heads which I conceieve
to make up the sam total of the policy
SoCth inistration"-vi:
l5t. ch iation of Radicals.
id ond. Condonation of the crime of the
r Rettirning Board.
id 3d Ikeoring of infinential spepibers of
4.th. tNon-lerfarence with the Lou
e isiel etate o Lottery.
l 6th. The continued fostering of mo
b Cpgnvotio of$ people.
4th, Noa-Iterfb aE. with She oppre
vea seaolaments of the great o~lic in
this itT.
8th. Bad appointments all over the I
State.
9th. Just enough of economical retornI a
to appease, if possible. t
1 then take up these heads singly and Y
sustain my position by pointing to the
facts as I and many others comprehend f
themi. a
I condemn the effort to reconcile prom
inout and corrupt Radicals, such as t
i'inchback and Howe, as useless and r
wrong; I condemn the worse than non
interference with the Louisiana Statie
Lottery; 1 condemn the fostering of mo
inopolies; I argue strceiuous&l" for ai Con
stitutional Colnve\ntion, and condeln al;
oppositio, to it ; I condemn the failure
to break up, root and branch, the weal- a
thy otlices of this city, which oppress the t
taxpayer and crriupt our politics; I con- a
demn mianifestCy bad appointments; and a
I condemn half.way measures of reform. t
But I have gone a step farther; I
criticized the treatment of the White
League, and on this point "Justitia"
seems to be utter'y incapable of rising to
the plane assumed by me,. lie cpnstrues a
my criticism into a complaint of want (
of otlicial pattonage bestowed on the j
members of the League-a want of the
loaves and fishes, the "spoils" of office
and he -oes on to enumerate individuals a
of the League who hold offices by ap
pointment I do not wonder at the con
structiou put by "Justitia." No doubt
it has, by -association, become a second
nature with him to view all matters
from the standpoint of public offices.
But I must tell him that the plane I
stand on is infinitely higher. I criticised
lthe Executive for using the strong arms t
of the League and ignoring their Irains.
I pointed to the fact that their brauins
and arms saved Louisiana on the 14th
September, when "compromise" and
"Conservatisnm" had not only failed of
good, but had absolutely helpedl to in
crease our woes; and 1 pointed to the
fact of the utter impotance of "coin
promise" and "conservatism," and the
sa~ing power of "Extremeism" on the
9th of January. I argued that the
White League was not a mere league of
brute force, but a league of hearts and
arms originating in, and bound together
by a superior order of political in
telligence and sagacity. 1 condemned
the use of this power in its sole capacity
of brute force, not only as a poor com
,.liment to the grand foundation on
which it rests, but as an exhibition of
scant political sagacity. I stand by my
condemnation.
"Justitia" produces the letter of resig
nation of the Commander of the White
League, and the pretty speeches that
passed between the Executive and this
gentleman on the 14th September last,
as indicative of the political cordiality
that exists
If he is satisfied with his illustration,
I am.
"'Jnstitia" quotes from Plato to show
that rulers should govern the whole peo
ple alike, or in the interests of all alike.
I will help him out by quoting the un
equalled political apothegm of Jeremy
Bentham-"General utility."
Every legislative act, according to
Bentham, should have as its foundation
stone "general utility." No man, in any
age. has ever so forcibly thrust into the
faces of executive or legislative officers
the definition of the sum total of obliga
tion to the public as has Bentham in
these two simple words
Referring to the exhibit laid down as
the policy pursued by the AdmiListra
tion to the present time, I ask of any,
and every free and intelligent mind
whether things have been conducted on
the basis of "general utility 9" "Juati
tia," no ooubt, thinks they have, but I
tell him there are thousands who think
otherwise.
"Justitia" must be a lawyer, for he
clearly manufactures a sub-stratum on
which to build his castle of attack, not
friom my clear meaning, but from my
isolated words. This 1- worse than un
fair, but it is the natural growth of some
soils. and I must simply cut the noisome
weed down with the scythe of truthful
explanation. No fair nind could possi
bly so distort my meaning, but fair
minds who never read nay letters would
condemn me on his showing alone.
"Justitia" knows full well the political
nomenclature that has for some years
pervaded this State, and more especially
the city of New Orleans, and his at
tempt to put me in a class separate from
the great body of my fellow-citizens
and then to characterize one as "hbaving
nothing to lose, and everything to gain
bIy agitation, commotion and violence,
because property, family and social ties,
position, intelligence and the higher
qlualifications of citizenship, make men
thoughtfil, reflective and indisposed to
be rash or reckless, and consequently
Conservative"-is worse than inexcunesa
ble.
Again, he more than insinuates the
lowest faithlessness to the Confederate
Cause.
All of this is the unreasoning staff
with which hired penny-a-liners or over
zealous political parasites crowd papers
to choke off criticism of government
They are of necessity, the supporters and
apologists of whatsoever wrong political
ly may be done, and of whomsoever may
do it, and they cannot rise to the reali
zation of the fullest criticism, being not
only aright, but a duty of the citizen
governed.
The first great political division of the
people of this city and State was into
Democrat and Radical. The machina
tions of Warmothl gave birth to the so
called Liberal Republican-or, better,
SLiberal-party. eFor a short time the
Reform party existed, hut its name and
Sidentity were lost.in the fusion of Demo
Scrats and Liberals against Radicalism in
the McEnery campaign. As the cam
paign of 1876 opened, the name Liberal
was lost in that of Conservative Party,
and we then had Democratic, Conserva.
tive and Radiel. At Baton Ronge in
1871, the white element of the State re
solved to unite solidly against Radical
iem; hence the campaign wmas fought by
the Demooratie-Conservative Party ver
sus the Radical Party; and from that
time to this, the nomenclature has re
mained unchanged.
Now, whence comes the political term,
"Extremist " "Justitia" knows perfect
ly well the full history of the name, but
in his venomous review he has seen prop
er to suppress it, or to misapply it for
unfair ends.
In the course of the political turmoil
here, and long before the 14th of Septem
ber, a comparatively small number of oar
citizens-men having all the qualifica
tions which 'Jastitma" seem to think
necessary to entitle a man to the piivi
legs of complaining of bthe government
that is over him-organized themselves
into an association called the 'White
League." These men were tired of the
means of action and modes of thought,
hitherto adopted for freeing the State
from despotism, they felt that the tac
-had to be changed, and they organi
and bided their time.
N1ow, for the firat time, was heard upon
our street-from the mouths of Radicals,
Democrats, and Conservatives-the term
"Extremistn To all citizensu who had
not yet risen to their plane of thought,
a the White League was an "'Extremiat."
rThe Radieals roared the epithet North,
South, East and Wet, for bloody-abshirt
political elfect; the Conservatives de
Snoanced it, fesTrng its deleterious efflect
of his namby pamby political program
f me; and the Democrat, knowing that
every White Leaguer was a Deoerant,
- trembled least all the peaceable ways of
the Democracy should fail because of
- this pernrictous, mad and riolent off
shoot of its body. I repeat, to be knowrn
nas a White Leaguer was to be pointed
at as an 'xttmrnist,"
- finally, I ha'vr#awr; beor, the
o timsfbetb h~q dmoU h shl~pvir .
Despot went one step too far; regular
De'mocracv and Conservatism quailed, or
at least were dunm-foundered and inac.
tive; the League-"Extremism'--re
vealed itself in all its hideousness -or, if
yon will, its wisdom. 'Extremism" met
force with force, and redeemed Louisi
ana'
The term 'Extremist" does not apply
to me then, painted, denounced, and de
rided as I am by "Justitia"; it is by
long et.tablilhed priority of claim, the
othtr, the political, name for White
Leagu,tr. alti tlho~s art the noblest, the
bI. the i mout reponsibleu of men, who
accept it and are 1proud to hear it.
The name, "Extremist,"' as I know it
aye, tidt ul "Justitia" knows it-is a
term thu t cannot be assumed here by
any such miscreant us "Justitia" imo
agines andlt paints me. It belongs to his
tory; it is an offshoot of the Democrat
ic Party; in fact, it is of the party a
part, and while "Justitia" may give the
word an abstract definition, according to
some l)ictionary, and make it appear
all that is bad, at this date in New
Orleans it is a political title which
better niu--becausiu fairer nmen-than
•'Jutitia" are proud to bear.
I will not degaide this reply by per
sonal comparisons with "Justitia." I
will only say that if he ever comes to
know who I am, he will be ashamed that
he ever covertly or openly questioned
my Confederate record, or my fullest
respounsponsileilty in every relation of
life.
And, now, does "Justitia" desire to
know what I r,.ally think of the Execu
tive ? I will tell hinm.
Personally, I consider the Executive a
thorough gentleman, a gallant soldier, a
citizen tna yur et sans reproche. Politl
cally, I do not now impugn, ansd never
have impugned his integrity of purpose;
but he has been misled, or he is over
zealous in the cause of what is called
"Conservatism ;" his zeal for what is
called "State credit," and the welfare of
the money power has blinded him to the
interests of industry, and he has created
dissatisfaction and unrest. If he will
earnestly study Bentham on Legislature,
he will see the error of his way, and be
may yet be found subscribing fully to
the doctrine, that "general utility" is
the corner stone of all proper govern
ment.
AMICUS CURLE.
N. B.--As "Justitia" ungraciously
wandered into the columns of the Pie
yune for the publication of his review,
possibly he may see the propriety of
securing a place therein for this reply.
MASS MEETING
Of the people of Winn Parish at
Winnfield, on Saturday, July
13th, 1878.
Organization of the Democratic
Conservative Party was perfected by

respective Wards, viz:
Ward 2, W. S. Peters, J. G. White

W. D. Bevill, S. N. Smith and J.
E. Sikes, with W. A. Little and (. A.

gates to the Senatorial Convention to

The following Resolutions were
unanimously adopted:
let. That we repose implieit con
fidence in the government of the
State of Louisiana as administered by
Governor Francis T. Nieholls.
2nd. That whereas the Constitu
I tioh of the State of Louisiana adopt
ed in 1868, is oppressive, and detri
mental to the best interests of the
people of this State; and whereas
the Legislature at the session of 1878,
refused to call a Constitutional Con
vention, or submit the question to
the people at the next general else
tion, thereby ignoring the wishes of a
large majority of the Democratic.
Conservative party of the State; and
Swhereas we deem that such action on
the part of the Legislature, and their
further action in their having propos
ed certain amendments to the Consti
tution, is an infringement on the
rights of the people in whom alone
lies the right to frame the fundamen
tal law; therefore, we recommend
that the proposed amendments be de.
feated, and that the delegates elected
to represent this parish in the Baton
Rouge Uonvention be, and they mre
hereby instruected to support any
measures tending to the earlyeall of
: Constitutional Convention.
d. That the delegates elected'to
represent us in the State Counvention
Sat Baton Rouge be, and they are here
Sby instructed to case the vote of Wion
Sparish for Hoo. John C. Moncore, of
ICaddo, for State Treasurer, and for
Hon. J. Elam, of DeSoto, for mem
ber of Congress from the 4th Con
Sgresasional ]istriet.
4th. That the delegates elected to
-the Senatorial Convention at White
Sulphur Springs be, and they are
Shereby instructed to vote in samid con
vention for some competent man from
Wine parish, and that they stand by
him as long as they think there is any
possibility of his nomination.
5th. That the Parish Execative
Committee be, and they are hereby
I instructed to call a primary election
- at such time as they may deem prop
er, and that they adopt the same rules
SIfor the government thereof that gov
erned the primary election of 1876.
