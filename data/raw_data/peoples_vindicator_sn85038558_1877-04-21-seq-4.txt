'ro our mind the first thing rew ate

has b,,en talk induilged in for a long v'tc
time by our hland owners, iof their Ic
desire to asll lands to actual settlers, A
and we intend to make it a point soon
hereafter, to get doiwn in figures l' d
what inducements they Inopose to
offer that class of peoplec to coelli t,
here, who will put brain behind their nid

While we are engaged in this ef- Ir

to make a tmovement in the matter of

Cost of Cotton Production. tin
]N. O. New Delta.]
The Neiw York (lonrnereial and At
Finitnectil Chronicle, in a recent arti- sill
cie on the above eulnject, says that Vi
since 1875, through enforced economny el
amtong cotton planters, tile turiing i i
point has come, iand tile last cottoni anl
crollp has provedl that cotton cal be Ie
raised proHtitably in t1he1 otierii liin
States at present prices. The Chroni- gil
cle gloes ~ on to say : il
"Iln proof of this last statement, tnl
one illustration is as good as a thou- r.
1an1d. A friend who ihas a jlhtntaiion ge
in Southwestern Georgia, gives Itis
the result of his year's work. He
does ntot live on or ietar his pIltlltt
tion, but rnns it n ith an overseei ;
of course a very expensive ald pro, tie
digal way. Our Georgia friend says tii
thaiit tile total cotton crop hlie raised
the past season was 1683 bales, weigh.- ft
ing when sold 82,175 pounds. He
sold early in tile season, and there.- ii
fore did not get by one and one half co
centsper pound whiat lie could have fi'
realized later. But after paying all ar
thie expenses of sale, commissions, lo
etc., the net proceteds of his crop t
were $7,828 51), or about nine and a f
half cents per pounds. The total aC
cash exlteises for the year, of every ni
kind aind ilescr'iption, including tnaxes, en
live hIundtred dollhis for overseer's a
wages, labor, etc., anliounted to $511 . f"
'T'o this should be added ten per cent. 1
on two tllonauind dollars, the value of Ih
the mules employed on thie planta. in
tion-as experience shows that per- f
centage about covers the wear--la. it

6:60e. as the actual cost of the cotton rr
per pound, leaving thie net ptrofit tH
2:00c. per pound, or a total profit of ct
*2,510 50. Hadll thie crop been sold ti
later, tis profit would have been ri
about $1,00') more. t
"To really appreciate these results,
we must remember that this planta
tion had~a non-resident owuner, and
was worked entirely by an overseer as
who was paid five hIundred dollars am
year wages. Had the owner lived it
upon tihe place, hie could undoubtedly re
also have obtained the support of tO
himself and family out oi it, aund have th
saved the overseer's wages. Besides, th

He The German Millet.
ee A writer in a Northern paper gives
pro the foullowing description of the cul
sOys tivation and growth of this excellent
used
Bigh- forage:
H "It will grow from five to eight feet
ere. high ; blades presemibling youling corn,
half comie out on the stalks about every
have five inches. iThe stalks and heads
Sall are large in proportion to the stand
o on the ground. It will yield fromli
crulp three to five tons of hay, and from
ild a forty to sixty bushels of seed to the
total acre (In good land. The stalks, when
3very mat'ured, are soft The hay will be
eaten readily by all kinds of stock,
'wer's and the seed makes an excellent chop
5 t'j. for feed. It may be sowed from the
cent. 10th of May to the 1st of July, and
a of the graiss will be ready to cnt for hay
iita- in sixty days. About one-half bushel
of, seed should be sown to the acre if
-a- it is intended to thresh the crlop, and
three pecks if lolly for hay. No crop
gIves is more profitable for the farmer to
otton raise for feeding all kinds of stock
profit than German millet. The glowing
itit of crop of this wonderful grass is beau
I sold tiful to behold, and it excites the cu
been riosity of all who have not cultiva
ted it."
and Farmers should fatten their hogs
rsecr as quickly as possible, but not try to
lars a make them very heavy. Ordinarily,
lived it does not pay to keep a hog after it
tedly reaches 200 or 300 lbs. It costs more
rt of to make the second 100 pounds than
have the first, and still more to make the
iides third 100 lbs. and so every additional
there pound becomes more expensive.
