We call attention to the fact that
although "a friend, and a true one,
of the people," we must live while
we fight. We cannot publish anything
without pay; and being willing to do
our share, and more, of the work, still
we are constrained to call upon our
friends for pecuniary aid. We feel
it has only to be intimated to assure
a response.
We return thanks to our numerous
"brethren of the quill," for the kind
manner with which the editor of the
Vihdiktor was treated, durtug his
trip to Baton Rouge and New Or
leans.
Our parish has been visited daily
adaring the week with refreshing rains,
cooling the heated air and parched
earth. Caterpillars have as yet done
no damage. Crop something over
one half.
River still very low and falling.

Our thanks are tendered to the Ra
pidet Agricultural Fair Association,
for ani. invitation to attend their se
cond meeting at Alexandria, which
takes place Monday, October 19th,
1874.
Business acotinues dull in our city,
very little if any new eotton offering.
Steeks with our merebhants generally

Radical Pledges,
It seems strange that some of our
people, and we must say it is con
fined to but few, should desire to con
tinue to place confidence in the im
plied, expressed or written pledges of
the former Radical leaders of our par
ish, men, who to-day, would do us
all the evil in their power were they
not constrained to keep quiet from
fear of responsibilities. We have all
Along opposed an affiliation, line of
policy in our dealings with the charac
terless individuals representing the
opposition in our parish; and had our
advice been strictly heeded, the con.
fidence still lingering with some few
colored people, in them, would have
long sinc been lost. For in no in
stane since ince our first movement in
June have we appointed a commit
tee to wait upon them that did not
tend, in their opinion, to give them
some self-confidence. Now, at this
moment when all reasons for holding
intercourse with them have ceased,
we must think strange at least, of any
one who would advocbate it, even from
motives of policy.
We could not accept any pledges
firom these men either as a body or
as individuals, for we have but to
refer to their solemn assurances made,
written, signed and published as an
organic body in 1872, not to inter
fore or disturb the compromise then
made between the legal McEnery and
the usurping Kellogg officials in this
parish, to have an illustration of the
manner they give and violate pledges.
The moment affairs had resumed their
wanton course, and the people had
been lulled into a senae of security,
their agreements were violated with
out compunction and' made an open
boast with Boullt and his underlings
of how lhe had us under his feet.
The Parish government then foist
ed upon as, will long remain in our
memory, and we fearlessly say that
the violation of the compromise of
1872 led to our action in 1874.
We cannot, n-or on our own part
will we trust these men at all. Their
promises are perfectly idle and we
laugh them to score. Once, have we
been duped, and that was our misfor
tune, it would be more than criminal
to allow ourselves deceived thescond
time. We know them too well.
Breathing time Is all they desire.
They imagine this just and indignant
feeling of the people, will blow over,
and they will again be allowed to go
on in their work of plunder and til
lainy. We take the past for our ex
perience and reject in tote all pledges
from these thieves, and should any
be accepted, we can only predict
untold calamity to our people.
Changing Color.

assunmed, in the numerous changes of
its Editorial staff, the Camelion quali

Federal Interference.
That our people may not misenn
derstand the.fact, that thie Attorney 1
General has applied for troops to i
President Grant, and that functiona
ry has instructed the Secretary of i
War to furnish them in "sufficient" a
numbers to preserve peace, and arrest I
lawless individuals in the three States
of South Carolina, Alabama and Lon- :
isian; we publish in full the dispach- i
es relating thereto.
We are all of the smime opinion as
to what we will do in the event of i
their being sent to our midst, but I
how that action' will begin, public i
opinion seems divided. That our i
minds have been long since mane up,
that no power on earth can continue i
this Kellogg fraud in rule over our l
people, and that we will resist to the 1
death any force that may be applied I
to that end, is the fixed and unaltera- I
ble determination of the people of I
Natchitoches parish.
The United States troops can come I
among us for two purposes, Ist, to pre- I
serve order and restore peace; should
we require their presence for such
purpose, and which does not exist at 1
this time, for the civil authorities
aided by the willing assistance of the
white citizens, can check all violence
and arrest all offenders ; 2d to foster,
protect and defend the continuation I
of the monstrous iniquity, the plamn
der upon Government, which has ex
isted by sufftrage alone, for the past
six years in Louisiana.
We can have no serious objection to I
the Federal authorities sending a
force here for the purposes first spe
cified, but their residence among us
will be trying indeed, not from any
fear of an outbreak of our people,
but their situation will be singular,
and they will be compelled to con- I
duct themselves with care, and their 4
acts must be strictly in accordance
with the erpressed purposes for which
they come. But should this move
ment of troops be intended for a Fed- i
eral interference with the affairs of l
Louisiana, a movement to give 1
strength and back bone to the plund- !
eting thieves and merciless villains, a
who are noJ quiet, but not convineet,d,
then God help omr opponelts.
We are not disposed to bd blood
thirsty, but when a people who have
saffered with patience so long as we
have, have cried aloud to the world
for help, and that help has been de
nied as, dispair and desperation have
filled our nature, and we are deter
mined upon one of two things. That
Louiaiana mast be governed by white
cifieens, or that in sityj days she will be
blotted.from the iap of free S`dtes,
and a military force suficient to eon
quor 1s hrsll be stationrd in erery
neighlborlood.
We cannot understand why some
of our eitizens should indulge in the
pleasure of social intercourse with
the villainous bipeds, who lately lord
ed it over our down-trodden people.
It may be habit, bet we cannot say
it loolcs much like high tone. Have
gentlemen ever thought of having
convieta for assoeiates upon the pub
lie streetfs, have they imagined them
selves indulging in the social glass
with branded galley slaves, surely 1
not. ;Yet these, individuals are far
worse in character than the meanest
conviet that has ever disgasced the I
annals of rime. 'iiese menrarp not 1
only thieves, but they are tnralto too
their race and the vile betrayers of'
their civilizatlon. i
Let as see no moren of this hobnob
ing with them. We can he politeI
without being familliar, and distanee
with such characters, will lend en

We amre itt receipt of a comnmunica

R. H. Marr.
We give the following extract from
the speech of the Hero of the second
revolution in Louisiana--the lion. It.
I. Marr, as his views upon Federal
interference. We see his opinion
coincides with that of all true Louis
ianians, and regarding in the two
powers, attempting to perpetuate the
fraud, of the Kellogg goternment,
the United States as the greater, he
proclaims that the Federal power be
ing such, should be resisted with
more force tian the less. The Revo
Intion is a fixed fact and our people
rmust throw aside all legal gonsidera
tions or constitutional consequences.
If Gen. Grant chooses to interfere
in this matter and uses the federal
troops, to keep down the jfst indig
nation of the white citizens, and
thereby attempts to perpetrate the
monstrosity now attempting to govern
us, the responsibility most rest with
him. We will retire within our bor
ders, and putting our trust in the jus
tice of our cause and the God of bat
ties, try the issue upon the field, and
with us must survive or sink civiliza
tion and civil liberty:
lie said tha:t all governments that
were established without the consent
of the people were tyrannies and usur
pations. Kellogg cried for troops and
his appeals for them were many and
plaintive to dragoon the people into
submission to his lawless government,
and this adnmitted need for guns to
maintain himself stamped his golern
went a usurpation.
What did the usurper appeal to, he
asked, to law, to right, no, his appeal
was to might.
When a government was establish
ed against- the wishes of the people, it
was the right and duty of the people
to overthrow that government. He
did not wish to be misunderstood,
God forbid that any word or action
of his should cause a public distur
bance; but God forbid that aniy word
or act of his should induce any of
his fellow-citizens to bow their necks
to the yoke of the usurpation.
But although it was the right of the
people some times it was prudent to
delay the exercise of that right. He
then related how the efforts of the
people for a hearing had been met at
Washington, by the .ead of the Gov
ernment, and said now, if the Gov
ernment would not hear, when they
again refused to listen, then it devolv
ed upon the people themselves to re
dress their wrongs. Let there then
be an appeal to arms and to the God
of hosts and battle. See that there is
a fair registration, work for it, do
every thing for it that is possible but
compel it.
The Republican grows lachrymose
in its recital of the great wrong eom
mitted upon I. L. Faulkner by some
unknown parties in drowning his
mule; but with all its tears, we can
see some of the secret satisfaction of
its crocodilish nature, which under
lies the terrible outburst of indigna
tion in its last week's issue.
Come, Mr. Republican, to the causes
that led to this infamous act'. Was it
not for the reason that R. L. Faulkner,
who is a colored man, respectable
and respected, Hyperion to a Satyr,
when contpared with surch spawns as
the editors of the "Republican" or its
followers; that Faulkner, as we said,
was a member of the Committee of
Seventy, a Republican but net in as
cord with the theiving gang repre
sented by the "Republican" and its
brainless editor, that his property
was destroyed. Did not the fathers
of that journal say, "that PFulkner
deserved '500 lashes for being S mhmre
her of said Committe" a4 manot this
outrage be traced to just aueh talk
asthat ? We do not propose to shed
tears over this vile aet, which we con
aider a cowardly revenge, bat we,ian
tend to act in the matter. The white
people consider that Faulkner lost
his property from the frct that he
was their frfend,, and we intend no
colored man shall simamr from being
with us. Four fold, shall be who is
true to us, be rewarded.

We call attention to the card of J.
C. Deais, Cotton Factor and ICom.
miasion Merchant, T57 Caurode St.,
New Orleans. Our worthy towlsman
Dr. J. 8. 8tephens, is his reprsents-
tive here. We ea recommeasd the
house as a frst clasa one, ad partes
can be arssred of atisfaction who
deal with it.
The two thing that a roma will
"go witd" over, are usually, a new
dress Ipattern and a toothache.
I have always enjoyed the conft
dence of my lople, as will be evi
denced by their action. In 1868 1
canvassed the Parish in thatcampaign, I
was on the Democratic Executive
Committee. In 1870O I was elected I
mayor of this city over a life-long
democrat, and an old and highly es
teemed citizen, at th6 same time rep
resenting some of our citizens pro
fessionally at the bar. In 1872 I was
elected to the legislature as a liberal
republican, and have always enjoyed
the confidence of this people until I
became a republican:
I think it well to state in justifica
tion of these charges, that I announc
ed before I went into the republican
party, that I did so to bring about
reformation in my own parish, and
have done so by my last act, in hav
ing a good conservative democrat ap
pointed to the important position of
taxcollector vice D. II. Boullt, Sr.,
resigned.
I did not seek the appointment of
parish judge, as I declined to give
up quite a lucrative practice for the
position.
We extract the above from a letter
written by E. L. Pierson, and pub
lished in the 8Arersport Times of thei
6th. As the eoqmuanication referred
to is quite lengthy, and contains de
tails of business matters between
himself and Col. Wim. M. Levy,
which we consider as altogether pri
vate, and with which the public do
not care to intermeddle, its publica
tion in fulironld be uninteresting to
our general readers; in consequence
we extract the only paragraph which
refers to the people at large, and pro
pose to give it "an airing."
It will he news to ninety-nine one
hundredths of the citizens of Natchi
toches parish, that this gentleman (A?)
ever "enjoyed their confidence," for
the statement is totally at variance
with the truth. Mr. E. L. Pierson
does not, nor has not, during the whole
course of his life, enjoyed tihe confi
dence of ten men in the parish of
Natchitoehes, and he himself is as
well aware of the fact as any one.
What honors the people have cod;
ferred upon him has been under pro
test and for specific reasons. The
confidence and esteem with which his
family was held, and is, by all our
citizens, bad all to do with his ad
vancements: The people of the par.
ish of Natchitoches knowing full well
his character, were disposed to forget
and forgive, but all their kindness
has been requited by his asp like
character.
lie was elected Mayor in 1870, upon
the young men's ticket, and simply
represented a symbol, possessing him
self no popularity, and every man
who then voted for him did so with
feelings of protest and are now asham
ed of it.
In 1872 he was placeed upon the Me.
Enery ticket not as a Liberal Repub
lican, but simply becamse he was reg
istrar, ad Lmsowing Ai. qwalitiee he
was nominatedl heesesmre he s. bi~d for
by the oppetoe. These are facts
that ean b..he teetiled to by all our
people. Let the gentlemma (t) con
line himself to his pivate mattors and
notdrag our people lato a support of
bhi character, or a vindication of his
acts, and we will have nothing to say.
But when he says Ih. enjoys the con
idenee, rspect or eateem of even a
respectabla minority of our eitizens,
it is sking to mecb, and no matter
how aueh we might desire not to
give this individual elfo importance,
we must brandit as false, and not
at all lsusceptible of proof. The two
latter elauses ae too imssy for com
meat.
We are pleased te learn of the ap
polutmat of our fellow eitizen, Dr.
8. O. Seragg,to the Chali of Thera

compliment worthily bestowed upon
our friena Dr. Serggs, but an honor
tenmdemd our prish, for which we feel
a gratefal pride.

Capt. John MitchlIl and his worthy
oicers of the steamer Flets, will
long be remembered for their energy
and klidness, in getting through the

them in Bton Bouge In time, he has
ashown a spirit worthy of emualation,
and will have the hearty support of
all oar people, which. we eonsider no

we cannot see why Capt. Mitchell is
not as deserving as any one for a
share.
Self-Help.
It is a true saying. "The gods help
those who help themselves." Non,.
the leess true, we believe, are the woru1h
which Schiller, in "Wilhelm Tell,"
puts into the mouth of Rediug :
"The gods help only. when ian
Can help no more."
