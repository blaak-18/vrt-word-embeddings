HIS SON LOST.
SWall You Help Me Find 1-"
Bo?'"
"Will you help me fiud my boy i"
is the request that has come to the
TimeesDcmuocrat from I; I) Strang of
Tcxarkana, Ark. It is with plei.nli
that we repeat ise question to every
sue of our readers. "Ou Saturday,
June 1. 1901," writes Mr Straug,' nmy
e ,M ax Straung, seven years old, bu
rath, r smwll of age, was put on the
torthboliund Cotton Belt passenger
r rin at Wace, Texas, by Sneriff .J W
Biker, for his home at Texarkans,
Ark., but either left the train, or was
taken from it, and since then all
efforts to find him have failed. He is
regarded by all as an exceptiousnally
bright, manly little fellow, and .such
as, experienced officers say, would
be the.delight3 of a peddler or a
showman. He is especially fond of
dogs and.'ponies, is very affectiounate,
but having known little of a mother's
love or care-she having been au in
valid for more than four years before
her death in December last-and
having no sister), he could, doubt
less, be easily enticed to stay, for a
time at least, with any kind.hearted
person who had pets for him to care
for and fondle. When he left Wact
he wore a pink and white stripec
walst, grayish brown pants and cap
and was barefooted. The only dis
tinguishing mark is a scar over hbli
right eye about hall an inch long
caused, when a babe, by his falllun
against the sharp corner of a doo
facing. Any information regardiu,
him will be thankfully received an,
t liberally re warded. Address all corn
muelcations to E D Straug, Texar
kans, Ark."
The 'ucasslan repeats the request
s and trusts that Mr Strang will soo
have his son restored to him. Hel
