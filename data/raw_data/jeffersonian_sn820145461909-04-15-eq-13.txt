So Glad, Plenty and Pest
(Continued from Page Five.)
till he came to a bend in the road and
there stood a little old duck. When
she saw the mule she thought, “There
is my chance. I will see who they
are.” So she said, “Good morning to
you all,” and the rooster crowed and
the mule nodded his head and the
old gander said, “What you want?”
“I don’t know what I want, but the
old lady at the house said I should
not eat any more idle bread and I
don’t know what that means, but for
fear something will happen I came out
here.” “Do you want to go with
us?” said the gander. “Yes, I want
to get away from here.” So the old
mule knelt down and the little old
duck climbed up on his back. They
kept going till they passed a large
farm house. Over in a field were a
lot of turkeys. One old gobbler came
gobbling to the fence and the old mule
turned and looked over that way and
said, “Now you are in trouble.
What’s the matter?” The gobbler
said: “Don’t you know next Tuesday
is Thanksgiving? Old Miss gave
orders to put me up last night, but
I got way up in the top of that old
mulberry tree and she couldn’t catch
me and I am sure going away from
here today. ” “ Well,come and go with
us,” said the duck. “All right,”
said the gobbler, so he flew up on the
mule’s back and away they went.
This jolly crowd went on their
journey chattering to each other till
they heard a noise in the bushes and
the gobbler said, “Whoa! Bro. Mule,
let’s see what that is.” Out came a
little old guinea-hen and said: “Pot
rack.” Now, they all thought this
meant she wanted to go, too, so all
of them called out, “Come on.” The
little old guinea flew up on the mule’s
back and they started off. They met
an old dog and the mule said, “Who
wamk, who-wamk, ” and the dog
yelled out, “Bow-wow, bow-wow-oo,”
long and pitifully and the mule said,
“You may go, too.” So the dog
walked along and told the crowd how
his master had bought a pure bred
Collie and said the old cur was no
3count and kicked him out the door
and said: “Go you old dog, you, I
don’t want you now.” Each one told
of all the good deeds they had done
and were sorry to be treated badly.
The old mule said: “Never mind, we
can make it all right.”
By and by a poor little boy was
standing by the roadside crying. The
mule says: “Buddie what’s you cry
ing about?” The little boy said:
“My Mama is dead and my Papa is
dead, and I haven’t got any home. I
don’t know where to go.” The mule
said: “Let me see your feet,” and the
little boy showed his feet, and the
old mule said, “Just as I expected,
they are blistered. Get up on my
back and we will go and find a home.”
The little boy climbed up. Now it
was getting dark and they could
scarcely see the road, but the old
mule kept going on. After a while he
began to get tired and said: “We
will turn out in the woods so if our
masters come to hunt us we won’t
be easy to find.” When they turned
out of the road they had not gone
far when they saw a light. The boy
said, “Maybe we can go there and
get something to eat. I am so hun
gry.” The mule said, “You all be
quiet and 1 will go up easy and see
who is there.” When they got there
it was a little old one romed cabin
and four men were in there gambling
around a table, and on the table was
a pile of gold money. Over in one
corner was a pile of corn and some
hay they used as a bed. The old mule
walked up to an open window and
put his head on into the room and
said “Who-waunk, who-waunk,” and
the men jumped up and ran as hard
as they could and left the money and
all; then the old mule laughed and
laughed and began to plan for the
future. The mule was the boss be
cause he could carry the largest load.
So he said, “Now, children, we must
each have something to do, so 1 can
eat the corn and hay, and the little
boy can have the money to buy what
ever else we need. The Rooster must
crow to let us know when day comes,
and the Guinea must lay our eggs.
The Dog must bark to let us know
when we are in danger. The Duck
must find us a spring of water. The
Gander must let us know what time
it is, and I can pull a plow to make
us ome more corn when this is gone. ”
The little boy said: “We haven’t any
plow,” but the mule answered: “We
can find one, maybe. ” So they walked
about a little, but decided to wait till
morning when they all went in search
of what they wanted. The little boy
fed the mule and made a fire, for the
gamblers had left matches and an old
brass lamp and an old coffee pot.
The little boy was so hungry he ate
corn and fell down on the hay and
went to sleep. Every hour in the
night the old gander got up and said:
“Yuar-yuar, ” and at daylight the
old rooster crowed. Then the little
old duck got up and went out and
not far from the house she found a
nice spring of water and came back
saying “Quack-quack.” The old dog
lay down before the door and watched,
while the guinea made her a nest un
der a pine tree that grew near the
ground and laid some eggs. After a
while a little rabbit came hopping
along and the dog jumped out and
caught it and the little boy cooked
it and gave a piece to the dog and
then he gave some corn to the gobbler,
gander, guinea, rooster and duck.
The mule said, “Little boy, we must
hunt a place to buy things, but you
must stay here till I find one,” so the
old mule went out into the road and
turned his nose first one way and then
another, then he said, “ I smell ap
ples this way,” and he went in that
direction till he came to a cross-road
and there stood a store, but the mule
would not go up close for he heard a
man say, “Here is a loose mule.”
When the mule heard that he gal
loped away as if he were young again.
When he got back home he told the
little boy where the store was and
then the little boy took some of his
money and went to the store. He
would not take it all with him, so he
bought some flour, lard, sugar and
butter and some bread and other
things that he thought he could use.
He had seen his Mama make bread
and cook, so he said, “I can do very
well.” Before he left the store he
bought some apples and gave them to
the mule to eat so he would always
tell him the truth. On then* way
back they saw a little girl lying asleep
Ueffersonlan
on the side of the road and the little
boy said, “Let’s wake her up,” so
he did and the little boy asked:
“What is your name?” She said,
“I don’t know.” “Where are you
going?” “I am not going any more.
I am tired of going. I have been try
ing to find somebody to love me.”
The mule laughed a big laugh and
said, “We will love you. Get up on
my back and go with us.” So they
went to the cabin and they cooked
dinner and stayed there all happy
and contented, so they thought, till
one day an old lady tired and worn
out came to the door and was so
surprised to see these children and
how then lived. The children were
glad to see her and said: “Don’t you
want to be our Mama?” and the old
lady said, “Yes,” and so she stayed
and the little boy and little giry
called her Mama, and the little boy
named himself Plenty and the little
girl said, “My name is Happiness,”
and -the old lady said, “My name is
Rest.” The old mule laughed and
said, “My name is So-glad.” Plenty
showed his money to his new Mama
and soon they had a nice little home
and were, oh, so happy

Hon. T. E. Watson,
Dear Sir: You will find enclosed a
P. 0. for SI.OO for which you will
please send me your Jeffersonian
Magazine for a year. Please begin
my subscription with the April num
ber, as 1 am very anxious to see your
article on foreign missions which will
appear in that number. I am with
you on the stand you take in regard
to missions and 1 hope those who
are kicking so at the articles that
have appeared in your weekly paper
will be thoroughly convinced.
1 am a Populist and have voted
for you every time 1 have had a
chance and will continue to do so
whenever you are in the field. 1 wish
I could express my enjoyment and
appreciation of your championship of
the common people, but words are
inadequate to do so.
Nothing would afford me greater
pleasure than to meet you face to face
and shake the hand of a man whom
I so much admire, and whom I know
to be honest and true in every thing
that he does for the cause of populism.
I know you have the welfare of the
people at heart; I believe that under
your leadership things will eventually
come right.
May God bless you, Mr. Watson,
and give you victory in 1912.
Yours truly,
Dr. C. P. Holmes.
