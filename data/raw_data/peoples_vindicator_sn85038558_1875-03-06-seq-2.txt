It was a Delusion and a Snare. I
No thinking or fair-minded man
can deny it now. That compromise t
which has been held up to us for the
last three weeks, as the best and most
masterly Stroke of policy which could
have been designed for the adjust- t
nent of our political troubles in Lou
isiana, is now dead and buried for
ever. The death blow has been giv- c
en it by the parties who gave it birth.
We have always contended, in sub
stance, that it was intended to weak
en our cause before the country ; that
the originators of it were not up
right in their motives; that it was a
dead sea fruit, beautiful, tempting,
and luscious in appearance, but that
it would turn into ashes in our months,
the moment we attempted to partake
of it. We have always warned our
people against it, and implored them
to be cautious whenever they dealt
with the enemy, and niot suffer them
selves "to be betrayed with a kiss."
The result has proved that we had
foreseen what would be the conse
quences, if our people would aban
don their vantage-ground and sur
render themselves disarmed, with
their hands and' feet bound, to the
enemy. RBead tile majority and mi
nority reports of the sub-Committee,
to Congress ; it is conceded by both,
that the Conservatives carried the
election in 1874, and that there was a
fraud in the illegal conduct of the
retaurning board. Yes, says Messrs.
Foster, Phelps, Potter and Marshall,
"we understand the committee to be
unanimous in finding the fact that the
action of the returning board has
defeated the will of the people as ex
pressed by them at the polls, on ite
3rd of November, 1874." they further
I say The registration was incorrect,
and exceeded the true colored vote ;
it was w.olly in the hands of the
Kellogg officials, with United Staten
Marshal Packard, at their head; that
republican Supervisors of Registraý
tion complained of unfair and insuf
Sfeent registration, in only three par
islhes; that the conservatives spe-,
fled withl proof, that there' were 5,2001
cases of conceded false registration,'
r in New Orleans alone; that the een
Ssuas of 1870, the correctness of which
is not impeached, showed 87,076:
whites,' and $6,913 colored males over
twenty-one years of age ; that statis
ties and evidence before them, show
ed no change in this proportion in
favor of colored voters, and yet the
registration of colored voters exceed
ed by 4000 the total number of cotored
adult males returned by the census,
while the registration of white voter
was 10,000 less. The minority report
has not attempted to deny those
facts, partisan and bitter as they are
ltowards the people of Louisiana.
They would certainly h've done so
if they could have had, even the slight
f est ground of a plausible showing ie
I their favor. But they did not, hence,
they stand before the world a self
Scondemned trio, of dishonest, prejn
diced and vicious snpporters of the
unjustifiable, brutal, armed interfer
ence of the administration in the af
fairs of our State.
Now, we ask, in the name of truth
and decency, what becomes of the.
yelping radical cries of iutimidation
and violence, on the part of conser
ratives, before, and at the time of
registration; in the interim between
registration and the election, and on
thile day of election t How t When ?
Where? We, and not they, have a
right to complain of intimidation,
violence and base fraud; becaunse
Sthe Congressional investigati, has.
proven, that we have been the vie
tims of such. outrages. This accounts
for the majority of monly 5000 votes
which we fairly polled at the election,
and n6t '"the Colfax and Cnousahatta
t killing eases, the ¢ireustanes.of
which are disputed,." To argue that
they have changed the result of the
election throughout., the State, is a
violent assumption, mot sustained by
actual facts, ."when it is recolleeted
thlat both those parishes elected a full
I Kellogg ticket by an ieceased rejpub
rliean majority, as not to be received,
- if any other cause for the vote of the
-State can be found." None other hass
Sbeen :produced iby the radicals, be
Scause they had run out to theirce-.
ble's end, in the fabrication of plaa
a sible lies.
SThe true camses of the repablican
'defeat are to be found in the disgust
ing; eorruption Of the Kellogg gov.
Serminent, which began to stink, even
*'in the nostrils of a large mass of our
colored population; in. the strife and

Texas and Louisiana.
The rapid growth of the great State
of. Texas, is a political prollcm well
worthy the serious conmideration and
study, by the people of Louisiana;
the solution of which has been a sub
ject of admiration and wo~der to all
thinking men of this continent, who
have watched her progress on the
road to wealth, prosperity and hap- '
pines+. Her example is replete with
good and wholesome le sons to us, if f
we only show ourselves apt and wil- b
ling to be guided and instructed by
it. There she stands, already the
Empire State of the South, and des
tined, at no distant period of time, e
to become the Empire State of this
great Republic. Yet, she has not
found her wealth ready made by the
hands of her Creator; she has not
unbosomed, to the gafe of an aston
ished and covetous World, extensive
and inexhaustible mines of gold, or
rich fields of diamonds, like Califor
nia and Brazil. Nature, in her ma- e1
ternal care and fondness, has been no
more bountiful to hIr tian she has r
been to Louisiana. She grows cotton,
tobacco, rye, wheat; and oats, not
without much labor; in s4pite of n
parching droughts which are almost
yearly plagues therei; in spite of "sv
age and warlike Iudians, andu maraud
ing Mexicans, whom the United States a
have hitherto beeD unable to put
down. She is the; beef .market of
millions beyond the imnits of her ter
ritory; she fights the Coemanhes on
the frontier, and the Mexican raids 1i
on the Rio Grande ; builds, churches, a
schools, telegraps a n d railroads; s
keeps up an extensive trade with the I
outer world; maintains a hard mon- I
ey currency;. upholds a free and re- (
publican form of government in the (
face of Grant and the Republican 4
party; hbngs horse thieves ; suppres- i
ses scalawags, and when a "stray
Yankee- in Texas"i is found playing
politician within her borders, she has .
but to tell him to "bit" and he "gits;"
she invites immigration and it cimes
to her from every point of the com- I
pass. Since last August, she has re- E
ceived an additional fabulous popn- t
latiofn of two .lumlidred thounand, by I
immigration alone. There is no dan- 1
ger of her territory being cat up into
various States, and thereby increas
ing Southern representation and pre
Sponderance in Congress, so long as 1
Northern jealousy land hatred of the 1
South are the cherished principles
inculcated by eve y Northern parent I
on his child. Imaine then, the great
ness and power of such a State in
half a century hence, when her entire
B territory of 237,00 square miles, will
Sbe as densely settled as Ohio is now.
SCab may one wprigtwhat soe iill be
at that time, e pecialy when the
SSoitthern Pacific tiailroad will have
been in active ope'ration through heri
extensive domain for fotty years, and
branch roads, Briarean-like, w ill!
ghave stretched thelir hundred arms in
every direction to eapture and empty
n into her lap, the riches and treasures
Sof this world i
SYet she had a gat deal to contend
aganest. $hae is known as the wild
SState of Texas. We all have heard
Sind read from ear boyhood daye
Sthat Texas, like ifome, was settled by
[l bands of robbers, vagabonds, fuogi
tive~s from justice, conviet and mur,
derers., If the refuse of the htman
race flocked there as to a land of ref
age, good people!went there to--to
better their fortunes. Gradually the
mixture of a good element with tle
bad had its influence; religion, edit
Scation and civilization worked quPon
Sthe masii; their morals were purii8
Sed; thrift, industry, perseverance,
labor and the spirit of enterprise, ae
Seomplished miragles, and to-day, the
"Lone Star State" shines with the
dazzling brillianey of abeautiful plans
et in the firmament of the Western
world. All thishab beeoaecom~sh -
Sed, not by her soil, not by nature's
peculiar tenderness, but :by thehideter
minatioh; eunery, hardihood a md d
bravery of her eobple--se is a hoal
ean for honest ~ea, and a hell for 411
rascals-she knows her rights ;. never
minpromises'them, and never rests
until she securej, them. Her people
e are charitable, generoeus, .and always
ready torel good servies in theim eause
of justice and liberty.
S Now, look upon this picture. Why
Scannot Loulsiawa do the same? Her
r. territory is not: as large, it is true;
i bothier sotl rs :superior; her climdte
t I more propitious; her products more

We must battle for our rights and I
never cease to battle until they are t,
granted and epcured. We must make 1l
life, liberty and property, secure 11
among us. We must drive plunder- b
era and dishonest adventurers from
our borders. If the law cannot reach Ih
them, hang them. If the govorft- i
mnent is an usurpation and a tyranny,
overtate it. If it is restored again,
overturn it again-make it too hot
for infamous scalawags and carpet- )
baggers to betray and rob as with
impunity. Teach the laboring class
n hite or black, that man is condemn
ed to earn his living at the sweat of
his brow, and that thes divine law c
prescribes but one 'Sabbath in the '
week. If they will not hearken, die
charge them. Teach them also by a I
hempen argument, that that which is o
not theirs, belongs to some one else. 1
Suffer no vagabonds, ibo traitors, no
slanderers in our midst. Let uq be p
economical, industrious, terribly 'in 0
earnest for our rights, and ago.ahead :
people, and there will be confidence
in our State government; capital will I
not be afraid to venture here; busi- t
ness will revive; a better feeling will
exist between the races;, every one ,,
will be contented, and our State will f
again lift up her head in joy and pride, t
and in prosperity.,
The Telegraph meeting was t
held at Temperance Hall, on Mon. t
day last, pursuant to notice pub.
lished in our last issue. Numbers I
of our citizens were there, but not
so numerous that they could not i
B be counted in less than a minute.
- A few persons of means were pres
- ent and subscribed liberally; one
e or two, without' means made a
bold appearance, for they had
nothing to fear, being unfortu
nately incased in poverty. A
very large number, however, of
, our substantial citizens of this
l city and vicinity, kept aloof, pre
ferring, through modesty, we pr$
i- sume,.to leave the success of the
updertaking to otheis. 8ome wag
SI remarked: that had the meeting
been called to decide upi;,'fthe
° qualities of superior Boirbon
whiskey, the hall wauld hlve been
too small, and that even the meon-;
Sbhers of the Temperance Society.
, would have been on hand to see
it the effects of spirits on man. -
t- The object was to consider the
in propriety of connecting by Tele
a graph, Natchitoches with Shrevi
11 port, via Coushatta and Minded.
r It is proposed that the sharp to
be contributed by the citizens of
Natchitoches and vicinity, is
$2000; by Coushatta 8800; to be
d raised subject to the order of the
I Agent of the Western Union
n Telegraph Line, payable as fol.
y lows: So much thereof as will
a pay for the costs and freight of the
wire necessary to connect this
d city with Minden, with a privileg
d thereon, for reimbursement in case
Sof failure; and the balance when
s' the line is completed.
A committee to take up sub.
-. seriptions was appointed. Wheth.
a er _they will be successful in their
. efforts remains to be seen-we
o hope so.
* It is our duty to inform our
Speople, that a bill is now pending
"' in the bogns Legislature for the
" incorporation of The Louisi an
' Telegraph Company, giving them
- the privilege, for twenty-.ft~ eyears,
e of constructing and ope'rating a
e line or lines of Telegraph, eIhnect
i ing New Orleans with Shreveport,
-a through way stations of which
- Natchiteches is one. But, .Athe
,l Company ha six. years to com

is, that the ,p~seage' of thtbilli
may prevent our pr t, endeava

The undersigned,. majority of the o
committee on the'stato of the South, t
respectfully report that they cannot tl
agree to the report made to the com
mittee by Meesrs. Hoar, Wheeler and a
Fryb. : The aLks inimical to the col p
ored people of Louisiana, referred .to Ii
in this report, hlave been repealed for e
years, except during the schism of c
Governor Warwoth in 1872. The re
p!blican 'party have long had contral b

In the absence of any direct evidence E
that the late election was not free a

must therefore have been prevented ft
from voting at the late election by" ,
the -recollection of- the Colfax and p
Ceushatta killing tases, the circnm
stances of which, are -4isapted, and
by'other riots' which occurred years
before, to-have changed the result of i
the election throughout the State, is c
an assumption so violent, wheu It is l
recollected that both those parishos m
elected a full Kellogg tioket by an in
creased republican majority, as not
to be received, if any other cause for 4
the vote of the State can be found. i
Such causes eist, and' are obvions,.
Among them are: First, the regis- I
tration was incorrect, and exceeded 1
the trae'doloti'it: . The registra- t

istered was 147,604 ; of these 146,523
voted. This is a larger proportion of

any of the lortherau States. In an
Sagricultural State, giteiS osettled,
where long journeys ihad ofte to be

a sonable to suppose that a greater pro

unable to prodace in the entire State
more than half a dozen persons to"
testify to anything impeaching the
