e are glad to see that our ex
Lellent contemporary, the Pioneer,

that swept over Napoleonville on
Dec. so.
Another grand jury has been im
neled in Netv Orleans and as
usual the papers anticipate that
I- tauch good work will be done. It 1
seems to a man up a tree that
s-~ New Orleans courts are very "on
t.artin" td say the least. They gen
erally start out all right, but it is in
the winding up where the trouble
comes.
+' Od the 8th instant a intiniber of
prominent citizens of New Orleans
hield a meeting at the rooms of the
Young Men's Business League to
take measures toward the relief of
the destitute people of Nebraska.
The meeting was largely attended
and a disposition was shown by all
ptesent to do everything in their
power to relieve the unfortunate
sufferers in Nebraska, and it is
thought that before long trains of
supplies will be sent to them. New
Orleans is always ready to do her
ihiire in any work of charity.
It is reported that recently a
Knox county (Tenn.) young lady
was teaching a class in spelling,
when the word "husband" was
written on the blackboard. None
6f the children could pronounce it,
and in order to help them out the
teacher asked: "What would I
have if I should get married?" The
reponse was very prompt, but it
*as not what she e':.ected, and she
blushed suc:h a l:rill:ant red that the
sunlight faded.
Suit has been filed in New Or
leans against the Pullman Palace
Car Company for the sum of $90,
boo, license alleged to be due the
State for the last six years. It is
Claimed that the retail liquor busi
ness has been conducted on 83
sleepers and that the receipts from
each sleeper was over $5ooo, hence
said defendants should pay a scp
hrate license for each of said estab
lishments within the State of Lou
isiana and Parish of Orleans.
The New Politics.
Col. Richard J. Hinton, the au
thor of "John Brown and his men,"
and other well known and valuable
ivorks, writes in the January Arena
a paper which all interested in cur
rent history in the making, will read
with keen relish. It is a masterly
presentation of the significant new
social and political factors, which
every careful observer of current
politics knows are gradually per
meating the minds of the great body
i' the electorate, the rank and file,
preparatory to changing tile issues
in American politics. It is perfectly
plain to all intelligent readers of
history and students of political
phenomena, that not only is a
change iimpciding in the issues in
American politics, but forces and
factors are at work throughout the
whole of our western civilization,
which shows that an era, following
mediaevalism, is closing, and society
is about to assume new relations,
...iew aspects, and to accomodate old
traditions and:customs to new con
ditions,

B AILOTC REFORM2 IN TUE 'p
·· a
2icmsend Tin i (k
The statdment : [hich `'Senator
Butler, of South Croliina, has ptait
but of the condition of affairs as
elections are concerned, now exist
ing in Sduth Carolina, is most start
ling, but no orie need to be surpris
ed at it. Senator Butler tells us
that the Tilmanites usethe machin
ery for fraudule;nt elections, not
only to disfranchise all the negroes,
but to disfranchise also 4o,oo0 of
South Carolina's best white citizens,
and that it is by the use of this C
fradulent election machinery that
Tillman's plirty his taken possessioii
of the State and sent rillman to the
United States Senate. We hope
most sincerely that the Senate will
adopt the resolution offered by Mr.
Allen [Pop., Neb.], providing for
a committee to investigate the last
election of a Legislature in Ala
baima. These cases illustrate the vi
tal importance of the fight the Z7iies
is making for honest elections in
Virginia. 1Ve have often polnted
out, what every man's common
sense tells him is true, that if we
tolerate frauds in elections to beat
the negro; just as soon as the negro
is no longer a menace one part of 1
white population will begin to cheat
the other part to appropriate to it
self all the honors and emoluments
of government. When; nearly
twelve months ago, the Tites dis
covered that our elections had be
come rotten, the State was at once
furnished with a tremendous illus
tration of how we should wind up if
cheating in elections were tolerated
at all. Many men are still apathet
ic when they are at the verge of a
system that will insalve them, cor
rupt them and degrade them. Wc'e
want every stimulus applied to these
men that is possible, and therefore
we want all the facts in the South
Carolina and the Alabama cases
brought out into the broad light of
clay.
Florida Times- Union (Dem.):
The public coniscience of the whole
country was never so thoroughly
aroused as now on the subject of
honest elections, There is notice
able divergence of opinion. All
men of all parties and all factions
are united in favoring the adoption
of such measures as will insure a
free ballot and a fair count.
Changes in election laws in the di
rection of superior assurances of
fairness will be made in many
States. Ilt ione will they bc- more
needed than in Florida. Our pres
'ct law could not be worse. Any
i election law administered by honest
men would be fair. Under our law
we have not di real republican gov
ernminent. The county conmissioii
ers and the inspectors of elections
constitute an aligarchy that can and
too often does rule the people.
The State convention demanded a
change in our election laws. This
is the one good thing that this con
venition did. The people demand
such change as will give each ticket
representation among the inspectors.
The legislator who opposes this de
nland will not only snake a grave
mistake, but will also commit a
grievous offense against the people
he represents.
Arcr* Orl'an:s Ti/bcs-Drircrrat
(Dcm.): We quite agree with a
correspondent of the Times-Demo
crart in whltt he says about thile bug
aboo of "negro supremacy being
used as an excuse for ballot-box
stuffing, fraudulent counting, etc.,
to perpetuate a Democratic ring in
power; and we believe the people
are beginning to understand this
trick. At the same time, we do not
agree with our correspondent that
'the mhovement for bollot rerorm is
nothing more or less than an effort
to postpone honest elections." We
need both ballot reform, including
Ithecii a c iualification or limitation
of the negro sufferage which will get
rid of the negro bugaboo, and hon
est elections, and we believe that
both can be won together. Our
correspondent thinks that the great
political battle in Louisiana in x896
will be for honest elections. W e
hope and believe so. i'thE times
Democral hoped that we could se
cure some improvement through the
late legisTature. We would suggest
to our correspondent not to doubt
the advocates of ballot reform, but
to unite with all the honest elements
of thle State, who constitute an im
mense majority of its population, to
protect Louisiana from the rule of
the ballot-box stuffer.
e Cha??tzhmga Times (Demn.): We
cannot reform the ballot by trusting
9 the enactment of right laws and
e their enforcement to mere partisgias.
Democrats amid Reditblictuns-to the
•·I . -
peuitentiary. The man who steals S
a gote or connives at such a wrong S
is much a thief as a till-tapper o i
jSkpocket, and he ought to be
,punished as a thief. t
Naskville Eanner (Dem.): The s
purification of our elections is not
to be accomplished or promoted by r
going behind the electioli returns iu
for the partisan purpose of chang- C
ing results. Such a tmethod is h
necessarily dangerous afid gives op
portunity and encouragement to
fraud. It is not by overthrowing I
the certified returns of the sworn t
officers of elections that the ballot I
box will be protected, but it is by
hurling the penalties of the law up- a
on the officers who violate their r
oaths. VWhat w2 need in this State r
is to send a lot o ballot box manip- I
ulators and election corruptionists
The ballot niust be purified or our
Government is doomed. That it
will be reformed the late crushing
defeat of Tanimmany is evidence of
an impressive nature. Nearly all
election frauds can be stopped by
just a little vigorous enforcement of
the penalties provided in the law.
Send a few rascals to jail, from
sheriffs dowi-n to pool-booth judges, c
and we will soon see the end of
most of that busines. The Chatta- c
nooga Timens has been, for lo, these
many years, pleading for decent
election laws, with suitable penal
ties attached for their violation.
We shall go on thus pleading, and
meantime we shall not worry over"
what others may say.
Prof. 13, F. Riley, D. D., of the -
University of Georgia, in an article
in the New York in/aeema'de/, say i:
"''Within the last thirty years elec- I
tion frauds have been frequent in
inaily parts of the U nion; but per
haps no section has had greater
notoriety for this species of immor
ality than the States of the South.
It hs been a matter of much seri
ous and critical comment alike fro:ot
the press and the representatives ot
the National Congress. But little
attempt has been made to deny the
charge, howeve:r frequent have been
the efforts to palliate the offense, or
to justify the wrong. Within a
short period of time there has
sprung up, in different portions of
the South, a salutary sentiment
against a practice the reaction from
which is demoralizing andt ruinous.
It is interesting to note how rapidly
the spirit is growing as the dlenun
ciation of the practice is caught up
by ont prbminent journal after
another throughout the South. Of
course the majority of our people
have opposed it frdnt the beLginning,
but the dextrous man.ipulation of
politicians and machine nanagers
has put the matter beyond the con
trol of the pr otecsting clement."

There has been considerable
speculation alnotung the local poli
ticians of the city over the fact that
a number of the State officials and
Federal office holders are congrega
ting in Washington. Already City
Attorney O'Sullivan and Attorrery
General Cunningham have set foot
in the national capital, and to-day
or to.morrow it is said that Gov.
Foster vill leave the city to join
thetn and that he will be accoin
panied by Superintenldeslt of the
Mint Overton Cade. What has so
suddenly called these gel.tleimen to
the seat of governlmentl is rot posi
tively known. In contradiction of
the statemuent that the city attor;i.y
and the Attorney (;encral are there
for the pIurpose of attending to
several law suits affecting their
several governmnents, it is rumorctd
that they are in the capital for the
ptlrpoce of stsisting the other ofi
cials in endeavoring to make a numn
ber of changes is the personnel
of the govecrntnent servants in this
city. It is asserted that the mission
of Gov. Foster is not all together
in the interest of the sugar boonty,
but that hlie will advise in the matter
of ousting and appointing the office
holdeis as mentioned. In this con
Snection it is also said that several of
the gentlemen occupying high offices
in the government service in this
city are not specially valuable to the
t powers that be, or able to bring
much weight in the political battles
t which w'ill be foughlt between now
anti the next electiotn. low true
