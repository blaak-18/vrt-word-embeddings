THE
SUNNY SOUTH BROTHERHOOD
By DADDY JIM
FROM A BLIND LADY.
In the last issue of The Jefferson
ian I noticed a suggestion to organ
ize a club known as the Sunny South
Brotherhood, to look after the sick
and afflicted. If you will admit la
dies, I should like to become a mem
ber of your club. Nothing affords
me more pleasure than lending a
helping hand to those in need. Even
though a person may not have much
means, there are various ways in
which they can assist others.—Miss
Sara Abbott, R. F. D. 1, Rocking
ham, Ga.
(Miss Abbott is blind, and has to
support herself. Those who have
known afflictions are the best friends
of the afflicted. The man who has
known the sting of poverty is the one
to whom the tramp seldom appeals
in vain. Following the same line of
thought, I believe that a preacher
who would call, not the righteous,
but sinners, to repentance, should be
a man who was once a sinner him
self.)
ONE OF THE TWELVE.
I notice in this week’s issue a call
to organize “The Sunny South Broth
erhood”. I offer my heart and hand
to the cause. If I am one of the
first twelve, well and good. If not, I
am a hearty well-wisher. I hand you
$1 to help start the ball to rolling.
I think we can do much good. I
heard Mr. Frank Pentecost, of The
Brand Bank, who is with us on this
question, say he wished The Jeffer
sonian would organize a “Home Mis
sion Club”, or something of the kind.
We told him that the tiling was al
ready on foot. —J. A. Smith, Law
renceville, Ga.
(You are one of the twelve. We
will get to work right away. It will
take about a month to arrange mat
ttrs, and the first or second week in
May we will have a monster meeting
at Thomson, so as to mark our birth
day.)
i' FROM MISSISSIPPI.
I wish to become a working mem
ber of the Sunny South Brotherhood.
I am a “shut-in” just now, myself—
have been for a month, but am hop
ing that I will be well ere long. I
am a widow, but have a home and
loving boys and girls. I could not
help comparing my lot with that of
those less favored than myself, and
it is my desire to become an active
member of the Brotherhood. With
many prayers for the success of the
undertaking, I am, Yours in earnest,
Mrs. M. E. Hollingsworth, Terry,
Miss., R. F. D. 1.
FROM ALABAMA.
I would be pleased to become a
member of your new club, as I am
a member of the C. L. O. C., and
enjoy the work. I would be pleased
to be president of Alabama’s depart
ment. —C. Bartow Shipman, Haley
ville, Ala.
(Perhaps it would be best to let
the Brotherhood be self-governing,
and, as soon as we get a few working
members in Alabama, let them
choose their president. We. expect
to have a department for each
State.)
ALL ONE FAMILY.
Enclosed find ten cents for Mrs.
John S. Sosbee, of Cornelia, Ga. If
all her relations will do as much for’
her, she will not have a hard time,
for we are all the sons and daugh
ters of Adam. I wish to become a
working member of the Sunny South
Brotherhood.—Mrs. Marietta Nelson,
R. F. D. 3, Montezuma, Ga.
TWO AT A TIME.
My good wife and I wish to be-
come working members of the Sunny
South Brotherhood.—E. M. Thomas,
Whigham, Ga. •
Please enter our names as mem
bers of the Sunny South Brother
hood.—F. B. Parr, R. F. D. 3, Locust
Grove, Ga.

FROM UNCLE CHARLIE.
Here is a letter from Uncle Char
lie, otherwise Charles Noel Douglas,
of Brooklyn, New York, editor of
Comfort’s League of Cousins. Read
it, and if your blood doesn’t run
faster, and you feel like trying to be
a better and more unselfish man or
woman, when you are through read
ing it, I pity you for the thickness of
the hide around your heart.
“Dear Daddy Jim: —Sunny South
Brotherhood! Bully for you! You
have made a splendid start, and
you’ll be astonished at the tremen
dous amount of good you will be
able to do, not only for the suffering
souls who need your help, but for
your readers also.
“Nothing does a man, woman or
child so much real, substantial, gen
uine good; nothing lifts them out of
the husk of their every-day hide
bound selfishness like getting them
interested in some helpless, suffer
ing, needy soul, chained by sickness
and disease to a bed of torture from
which there is no release but death.”
»
Self-Centered Humanity.
“The women, God bless them, are
ever ready to share their last dollar
with the sick, and the little folks
will empty out their dimes banks
without a murmur; but the grandest
thing of all is to see a big, husky,
tight-wad man, who never before in
all his life gave a thought to any one
but himself, —a big, husky, whiskey
drinking, tobacco-chewing chunk of
self-centered humanity, feeling an ir
resistible tug of pity and sympathy
at his shrivelled heart-strings, and,
throwing off his swinish selfishness,
actually digging down into his jeans
for a greenback, and sending it with
a letter of sympathy to some suffer
ing soul, whose tale of woe has trans
formed in a flash mere human clay
into that diviner stuff which makes
man akin to the angels. To give
birth to divine impulses in a heart
choked with the weeds of selfishness,
deaf to the cry of the afflicted, and
dead to the finer sensibilities of life,
is glorious work, the greatest work
we can do for civilization, our coun
try and the race—Christ’s work. It
is the religion of the future, ‘The
Service of those who Love, in the
Cause of those who Suffer.’ ”
The Prayer Route.
“When the churches have tired of
threshing out the dead husks of doc
trine to dwindling congregations in
tent only on the selfish saving of
their own picayune souls, black-coat
ed reverends (?) will wake up to the
fact that mankind isn’t looking for
a patent fire-escape to glory, nor a
snug berth on the good ship Zion,
but, scorning the all-prayer route to
Paradise, prefers to enter Heaven by
the more manly method of loving
service and noble deeds.
“You can get a crowd of people
praying and singing hymns without
trouble, —it’s just lip-service, sanc
tified hot air, and costs nothing; ask
3effersonian
them, however, to pray ten cents
worth for the bed-ridden woman
across the street, and ninety per cent,
of the bunch beat it to the tall tim
ber, and leave the odd ten per cent.
—the real Christians, behind, to put
up the dough.”
Caring for Home Folks.
“The day is not far distant when
the Church will have to do for the
sick and suffering at its very doors
at home what it is doing to “convert”
the Chinks, Japs, Hindoos and Afri
kanders abroad.
“I got a wheel-chair for a poor
woman living in the wealthy city of
Des Moines, lowa. She had been a
faithful church worker for years, and
sent me references from the pastors
of several swell churches. If I re
member rightly, one was the editor
of a religious publication. It never
struck those reverend Willie boys
that they ought to have been
ashamed of themselves to let a bed
ridden invalid in Brooklyn, 1,3000
miles away, provide a wheel-chair for
a helpless member of their own spir
itual flock.
“I gave one of these gentry a piece
of my mind, and told him that a few
words from his pulpit would get this
poor soul a wheel-chair in a few
minutes, if he w’ould only speak them.
But he did not speak them. Guess
he thought it would rob some ebony
brother of Johnson, the colored
scrapologist, in far-away Africa, of
the chance of getting some gold
store-teeth and a plug hat.”
We’ve Got to Do It.
“Daddy Jim, I’ve found out, if any
one is going to care for these neg
lected, forsaken, suffering souls--*-
and there are thousands of them—
we’ve got to do it ourselves. The
churches won’t do it, and eighty
per-cent.-graft charitable societies
won’t do it.
“I’ve been helpless on my little old
bed for thirteen years, and the min
ister of my parish—a parish I’ve
lived in seven years—has never been
to see me but once, and that’s nearly
seven years ago. My experience is
the experience of nearly all others
similarly situated. If I had a few
million dollars, I’d have scores of
reverend gentlemen breaking their
sanctified necks climbing upstairs to
see who could get the first grab at
my wad for foreign missions, less the
usual percentage for expenses.”
Where Every Red Cent Counts.
“I send you a list of the shut-ins
in the Southern States. Several of
these poor souls have had their backs
broken, while trying to add to the
millions of the Coal Trust magnates.
“The beauty of this glorious work
is, that there is no graft in it. The
money goes direct from the giver to
the afflicted. Every red cent counts,
and that’s as it should be. When it
costs eighty cents to give away twen
ty, that is not charity, but rotten,
contemptible, criminal robbery, for
which there is no earthly excuse.
“It costs but little money to in
vestigate cases, and I save most of
that expense by making applicants
for help investigate themselves, sub
mitting references from the local
postmaster, physician and minister.”
Good Luck!
“Well, Daddy Jim, here’s good
luck to the Sunny South Brother
hood, and if there is anything I can
do in my humble way to help the
good work along, just call on Uncle
Charlie. You will always find me
right there with the goods.
“God bless you in your noble ef
forts to bring sunshine and cheer to
the suffering and afflicted souls of
your beautiful Southland.—Frater
nally yours, CHARLES NOEL DOUG
LAS, ‘UNCLE CHARLIE.’ ”
NOW GO RIGHT TO WORK.
Isn’t that a splendid letter?
Through every line there shines the
innate nobleness of the great-heart
ed man who wrote it. A man in good
health, thinking of the poor crippled
fellow who has made life brighter
for so many, can’t help feeling the
glow of shame creep over his face
for his own unworthiness, or. shall
we say, thoughtlessness? Most folks
don’t stop to think about these
things. Now you sit down in a quiet
corner, and think it all out. Then
go to work. Find out the crippled,
helpless, destitute ones ..in your own
neighborhood. Talk with them, and
if you and those around you are not
able to take care of them, WE WILL.
For all practical purposes, our Broth
erhood is already in existence, al
though it has no organization. You
know, as well as I do, that the read
ers of this paper •will never turn a
deaf ear to a cry for help. Letters
can be addressed to the Sunny South
Brotherhood, Thomson, Ga.
THE LIST OF SHUT-INS.
The list which Uncle Charlie sent,
me is a long one, and will take some
time to prepare for publication. Next
week we will print it, and you will
see how cruelly urgent is the need of
an organization for home mission
work in this Southland, and you will
hear the accusing cry of these help
less ones at home going up continu
all against those who beg in the
name of religion for money to squan
der over the heathen in foreign
lands.
JUNIOR BROTHERHOOD
A BOY’S BRIGHT THOUGHT.
Dear Daddy Jim:—We cousins of
the Post-Card Club would like to be
long to the Sunny South Brother
hood, when it is organized. We
would feel better if we could give
some of the money that we earn to
the ones who are not able to work.—
Jennings Rehwinkel, Rehwinkel,
Fla. (Yes, we shall certainly have
a junior branch of the Brotherhood.
Arliijg Tootle, of Glennville, Ga.,
made that suggestion, and we hope
to see hundreds and thousands of
our boys and girls engaged in this
home mission work.)
FOR THE PRIZES.
Under “Our Post-Card Club”, in
last week’s paper, Daddy Jim offered
a handsome ring or pin for a girl,
and a baseball outfit or a book for a
boy; 2d prize, a knife; 3d prize, a
book; for. the best letter on “The
Sunny South Brotherhood”, not to
exceed 200 words. Competitors to
be under fifteen years of age, and all
letters to be received in this office
by April 7th. The first letter was
received the next day aftei- the pa
per came out.
Dear Daddy Jim:—The Sunny
South Brotherhood organization
would be the greatest and best club
that could be organized. Just think
of it. It would help the many crip
ples who are unable to make a living.
It would help the sick; furnish food
and nourishment to the needy, and
advocate better sanitary conditions.
It would make us better people,
teach us what charity really is. and
we would know that the Sunny South
Brotherhood is spending our money
on needy cases at home. One of the
many things a Junior Brotherhood
could do would be to buy school
books for the needy boys and girls.
I think one rule should be that we
pledge ourselves to support the Sun
ny South Brotherhood. I suggest
that children who want to become
members be given buttons with the
letters S. S. J. 8., and the grown peo
ple be given buttons with the letters
S. S. B. on them, for which they can
easily give five or ten cents. I will
give ten cents monthly to this cause.
—Robert McGinley (age twelve), 65
Beecher street, Atlanta, Ga.
Forty dollars in prizes will be
given to our agents on April 15th.
