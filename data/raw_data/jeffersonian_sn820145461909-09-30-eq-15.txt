why? Because the average voter is
more concerned about cholera in his
pig, than he is about political pollu
tion, in his Government.
Abuses have been legislated in, by
the smooth gentlemen who are sent
to Congress. If the people could be
aroused out of their supine and ca
lamitous subservience to party-names,
they could remedy every abuse with
in a few years, and restore the healthy
conditions of the brighter eras pre
ceding the Civil War.
There’s nothing wrong with our
system of government. It is perhaps
the best that Man ever devised. But
it has been perverted, abused, rev
olutionized by war and Federal laws.
What we need is to repeal those
laws, recover ,the ground lost by
democracy during the war, and make
our system conform to the Constitu
tional model. T. E. W.

seem enough to tide him over the
winter, must have just one more.
In a sense, he began to feel that
.he w r as now even with the Company.
He picked up little odd jobs, which
promised to keep him in coal and
bread. In his heart, he felt as
though he was a criminal stalking
about through the day on the dark
side of his fellow-man. He did not
go near the gate of the great pack
ing plant, a sense of fear came over
him when he would think of the
“blue-coat” watchmen with their
clubs and stars. The days and years
when he had been a happy, honest,
truth-loving and God-fearing man
seemed now like a dream. He was
just as honest with his neighbor as
ever, but he could not feel it. He
had deliberately taken that which did
not belong to him; had sneaked in
under covei* of darkness just like
any other thief, and if detected
prison bars yearned for him. If God
condemned the thief, his name was
now canceled in the Book of Life,
and the ugly blot awaited him in the
final reckoning. :•••
: M ‘Humpy,” the little Polock truck
er whose duty in the pickle cellar
it was to cart away the “sours” from
the inspectors’s tables, -was supposed
to count these hams and tell the scal
er how many were taken over each
day, also how many were trucked to
the sausage room. One day there oc
curred a discrepancy in Humpy’s fig
ures, —two hams were shy. An in
ventory was taken, and Humpy be
gan over. A few days later another
shortage was detected by the scaler.
This had never occurred before, and
the boss knew there was something
wrong. The matter was immediate
ly reported to the superintendent,
who ordered a watchman set over
the place after five o’clock in the
evening, and that a careful inspec
tion be made of every package going
out at the gate.
Poor Happy’s evil forebodings of
the watchman were not amiss in cor
rectness, but miserably at fault in
application. It had been so easy to
sneak into an empty car and when
it was set to the loading dock, make
his way in through any one of the
many doors unobserved, and out
v again and along the great dark wall
Vo the back fence. This was easy,
but Happy did it once too often.
The night w r as cold, and Happy
had waited unusually long for the
car in which he had concealed him
self to be sent to the docks. Shiv
ering from the cold, he was feeling
his way along a long tier of pickle
vats to where the pile of hams lay
near the elevator vestibule, when
suddenly, a section of electric lights
flashed up, and there stood a watch
man in arm’s reach of him. The
next instant two strong hands had
grasped him by either wrist. His
first attempt was to conceal his face
and wrench loose but this proved of
no avail. He now meekly submitted,
and begged for mercy. Having
known the watchman for several
years, he endeavored to prevail upon
him to let him go and save his fami
ly the poverty and disgrace his arrest
would bring upon them, as well as
the shame he would suffer. But this
catch would make a “bloomin’ ”
feather for the w’achman’s cap, so
poor Happy had only to submit to
the hand-cuffs and march along to
the office where a patrol wagon
would meet him in a few minutes,
and drive him away, without cere
mony, to the station.
Next morning the police judge
heard the case, turned him over to
the district court, and, in short or
der, Happy had heard the Company’s
attorney tell all about him, what a
bad fellow he was, until he felt un
der compliment to the court for let
ting him off on “ten years”.
As a crime, we cannot condone
what Happy did, nor can we wonder
that he did it. We can only pity
him, pity his poor family, and the
corporation that lost the meat!
SOME FINE SUGGESTIONS.
I am a Home Mission Primitive Bap
tist preacher. I am 37 years old, have
been preaching 17 years, and the
most of my work has been confined
to Georgia, Alabama and Florida,
although I have traveled and preach
en in twenty other states, from New
York to New Mexico, and as far
northwest as Nebraska. Ido a gen
eral evangelical work, having
preached 258 times during the last
258 days; ,I go without charge or
contract, feeling that as I have
“freely received I should freely
give.”
I have been a constant subscriber
for both your Jeffersonians ever
since you began publishing them.
I read, endorse and enjoy them. I
hope some day soon to be able to
own every book you have ever pub
lished. How glad I would be to see
your various editorials on the un
scripturalness, impracticableness and
extravagance of this modern Foreign
Mission “fad”, together with such
other articles on kindred subjects
as you might see fit to write, all
published in a nice volume. I sin
cerely believe it would do a great
deal of good in turning the eyes of
many good men and women to the
home field, which indeed is “white
to harvest.” I think, too, that such
a book would sell well; as so many
people have seen only a few of your
editorials on this subject and would
be anxious to read all of them com
plete.
Will you please pardon me for
offering a suggestion to you relative
to the increasing of the effectiveness
of your writings in your papers, as
awaking interest and arousing a
healthy enthusiasm on the part of
the subscribers? In small towns
and in the rural districts debating
©be 3effersonian
societies properly organized and con
ducted: discussing the various issues
for which true Populism stands, to
gether with kindred subjects would
surely arouse a degree of interest
that could scarcely be attained oth
erwise. You could furnish the “am
munition” in the weekly by having
a “debating department.” You could
easily draw up the constitution and
by-laws for such a society, then sub
mit subjects for discussion, with re
quest for reports as to which side
was victorious. A thousand such so
cieties would develop some good
fighters, and cause many, many peo
ple to hear and think who, other
wise, would not. For in thus train
ing the masses to do their own
thinking, investigating and fighting,
they soon come to see and feel that
it is their cause, their battle, and
hence will naturally put up a better
fight to win a victory that they will
fully understand to be theirs. With
your wide experience in dealing
with “men and things”, and with
your perfect knowledge of the situa
tion and its demands, together with
the fighting force at command, your
fertile brain would have but little
trouble in formulating and putting
a movement like this on foot, and
ng it well organized and prop
erly boosted. Such an organization
of societies by counties, states and
even national, would reach hundreds
and thousands of people with the
same proofs of the Populist position
and demands and would greatly aid
your papers in systematically and
economically and effectually educat
ing the masses to rise up by the
might of popular demand and do for
themselves what no leader could pos
sibly do for them.
I feel fully persuaded that you are
living and laboring through the Jef
fersonians—not for the vain ap
plause of men or for “filthy lucre”—
but for the uplift of the shamefully
down-trodden masses. Hence it
would be no abuse of such organiza
tions to make them instrumental (if
possible) in securing every subscrib
er to your paper and books that
they possibly could.
Trusting you will understand and
appreciate the spirit in which I write
these lines, and sincerely wishing
you and the Jeffersonians Godspeed,
I am,
Yours very truly,

THE SIGEL CASE.
The brutal murder of the unfortu
nate Sigel girl has filled the country
with horror. But tragedies have
the effect of making people stop and
think, and if this tragedy should have
the effect of putting out of exist
ence the stupid, useless, wicked and
hypocritical Chinese Sunday Schools,
Miss Sigel will not have died in vain.
The trouble is that our people know
nothing—and want to know —noth-
ing—of sexual physiology and path
ology. If they did, they would know

that sex plays a much greater part
than religion in Chinese Sunday
Schools—and perhaps also in some
others.
Also, it is about time we recog
nized that the religious missionary’s
work is a sorry business, and the
proselyting spirit which attempts to
convert the whole world to one re
ligion is nothing but a silly, fatuous
piece of impertinence. Let us leave
the heathen alone: We have our
hands full of work right here at
home, right at our doors.
If the mother Sigel, instead of try
ing to teach religion to the Chinese,
had instilled some common sense into
t e head of hei’ daughter, the latter
would probably not have forfeited
her young life. —Critic and Guide.

We notice that they have raised
the price of admission to the peni

cents. Personally, we wouldn’t care
if they made the price so enormous
that we couldn’t get in under any
circumstances.—Concordia Press.
There are no editors and onlj r a
few preachers in our state prison.
The “price of admission” is one that
the printer man never has to pay.
His course lies in an entirely differ

from the sanctum look for him in
the grand stand in the New Jeru
