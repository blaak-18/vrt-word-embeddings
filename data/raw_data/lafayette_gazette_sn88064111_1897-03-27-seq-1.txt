`the young murderers that Captain pmres

following notice on the door: "No Gen

Lafayette." Despite this informa- vie,

On the contrary, upon entering the of I
the prison he is struck with the exe
open-handed hospitality of the offi- rest
cials and the scrupulously clean ap- cut
pearance of everything that meets the
his eyes. Captain Thomas Fulham ly"1

exceedingly courteous gentlemen gal
and it does not take them long to rats

in the condemned cells on the mu
fourth floor. eld
There was no perceivable change

in the appearance of Ernest, but Cc
Alexis did not look as well as he ad
did when he was taken out of the in

new. After a few minutes spent p,
with the prisoners and Capt. Ful- w
ham, we left the prison. Ernest I
. asked Deputy Sheriff Mouton to s
call again and the next day we paid al
another- visit to the prisoners. It w
being Sunday morning services were k
held in the chapel. About ,
-50 prisoners were in attendance. p
The Blanc brothers were seated f;
together and participated in the,
ceremonies with apparent devotion. j
-%After mass had been concluded all O
the prisoners were returned to their
cells, with the exception of Ernest
and Alexis who remained several
minutes in the chapel. Sister Mary (
Borgia of the convent of
Mercy spoke to them and
gave them a few devotional
articles which they ieceived
with evident satisfaction. The
kind words of the good nun seemed
to please them very much.
Stands at the Head.
Aug. J. Bogel, the leading drug
gist of Shreveport, La., says: "Dr.
King's New Discovery is the only
thing that cures my cough, and it
is the best seller I have." J. F.
Campbell, merchant of Stafford,
Ariz., writes: "Dr. King's New
Discovery is all that is claimed for
it; it never fails, and is a sure cure
for consumption, coughs and colds.
I cannot say enough for its merits."
Dr. King's New Discovery for con
sumption, coughs and colds is not
a- experiment. It has been tried
for a quarter of a century, and to
-day stands at the head. It never
disappoints. Free trial bottles at

The differences which existed be

Jail Building Company concerning
the material to be used in the con
struction of the steel cells, has been
amicably adjusted. Key-bar iron
will be used instead of flat-bar iron,

pushing the work and will lose no

The committee, Messrs. WVm.
Clegg, R. C. Landry and R. C.

ing agent of the jail company, last
Tuesday and effected an adjustment.
The entire misunderstanding grew
out of the fact that Mr. Hull had
