THE NEWS TELLS TRUTH
Consolidation of County and City
Governments Urged as
Remedy of Evil
As an individual, how would you
feel after purchasing something for
$29,000 that you later learned could
be had for $10,000? Certainly you
-wouldn’t be very much pleased, in
fact, you would be so completely riled
that yoa would use many nights of
sleep.
As a taxpayer, how will you feel
when you learn that public money
was used for wild expenditures? Of
■course you will immediately demand
some explanation.
Well, The St. Paul Daily News, in
sn editorial the other day, calls at
tention to the “rotten county gov
ernment,” and presents some figures
that will make you grind your teeth.
We quote The Daily News as follows:
Rotten County Government
“St. Paul and Ramsey county tax
payers bought a SIO,OOO smokestack
for $29,096.36.
“They were forced to pay almost
treble what the smokestack should
have cost, in order that friends of
the city and county board of control
(night benefit.
“Here is a brief record which for
Inefficiency in government beats any
thing since the White Bear road job.
“Board of control lets contract on
* ‘cost plus 15 per cent’ basis.
“No competitive bids.
“Only one contractor considered.
“ “Bricklayers paid $1.50 per hour
<if the board’s books can be believed)
when the union scale was only $1.12H
An hour and other contractors were
ftiaving similar work done for about
$1 an hour.
“Carpenters paid $1 an hour (if the
books can be believed), when the
acale was 90 cents.
“Bricks and materials paid for at
excessive rates.

Family of One-Armed
Farmer Aided by
Ku Klux Klan
CALDWELL, KAN., April 7
With a wife and six children to
support on a ten-acre tract near
here, Adam Rohrer had a difficult
time supporting his family. The
battle was discouraging. He lost
an arm in a buzz saw and the fu
ture became blacker. However,
he had not counted on his neigh
bors and the Ku Klux Klan. They
£ resented him with more than
300. Klansmen contributed $174
to the amount. The Klan recent
ly presented $lO to an aged Negro
minister for temporary relief. He
had been retired by his congrega
tion because of his age.
“$1,500 paid to an architect.
“W. E. Boeringer, L. C. Hodgson
and Mrs. Hurley are the members of
the board of control who permitted
this ‘waste’ of money. Mr. Boeringer
and Mr. Hodgson are candidates for
election to the citv council, and Mrs.
Hurley wants to be reappointed to
the board of control.
Consolidate Governments
“Some day the county of Ramsey
and the city of St. Paul must be con
solidated. That is the logical meth
od of stopping the rotten misgov
ernment for which the county has be
come notorious. Such consolidations
have been effected successfully in Los
Angeles, St. Louis and other places.
“It is a long process, requiring
much legislative action, however, and
if taxpayers wait for that, much more
of their money will be squandered.
In the meantime, steps should be
taken to have all purchases made and
contracts let through a purchasing
agent. This also will require legis
lative action, but it is a comparative
ly simple process.
“The city buys in this way, and the
old habit of dividing among friends
the fat contracts and orders for sup
plies has been done away with by an
efficient and honest purchasing de
partment.
The city and county board of con
trol has long been suspected of the
practice of buying supplies for the
county farm and for the city and
county hospital from their own fa
vored friends or from friends of the
board of county commissioners, which
appoints two of the control board
members.
“It is unfortunate that the recent
grand jury, which had the right to
subpoena witnesses and get at the
bottom of the situation, did not see
fit to exercise the power.”
PITIFUL PRATTLE

peaceful and self-respecting atmo
sphere any influence so thoroughly
contrary to what all must recognize
as primary precepts of fair play.”
Don't get excited, folks, The News
will get over its present fears one of
these days, but wait a minute. There
is more to the warning. The editori
al further insists: “there is danger
likewise to the individual who al
lows race or class hatred to let him
into the Ku Klux Klan, and even to
the citizen who thinks the Klan is a
force to right wrong conditions.”
Look out for the cars, dear reader,
you might get run over. The prophet
of the ash pile has dipped his pen and
splattered the ink of imaginary fears
over the paper of ignorance.
With a final wicked jerk of the
pen, the editor grins as he dots the
“i’s” and crosses the “t’s”: ‘The busi
ness of Kluxing is of such a nature
that it cannot long endure, but as
long as it exists it menaces the insti
tutions and ideals sacred to Ameri
ca.” Don’t cry, little one, don’t cry,
you’ll be wiser by and by.
HOLD KLAN BANQUET
LE ROY, KAN., April s.—Two hun
dred persons were in attendance at a
banquet given here Monday evening
to Knights and officials from the
neighboring towns by local Klansmen.
Interesting talks were given, and
much enthusiasm was displayed.
ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA
‘ANTIS' DRUBBED IN
OKLAHOMA ELECTIONS
Pro« Klan Mayor of Capital City
Goes Back to Office With
Large Vote
(Special to The Fiery Cross)
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLA., April 3.
—Oklahoma is still in control of the
American voters, for they spoke in
no uncertain terms on Tuesday, April
1. To use a slang phrase, they “went
down the line” from mayor to the
humblest office in the city elections
held on that date.
In many larger cities the issue was
clean cut “Klan or anti-Klan,” and
the voters, in their sovereign power
said “Klan." It was a clean cut vic
tory for the forces of Americanism.
The heaviest fight centered in Tul
sa, where the anti-Klan forces lined
up behind John R. Hadley, while the
Klan forces marched to victory be
hind Herman Newlock, incumbent.
The vote was decisive, Newlock scor
ing 10,994 to 6,518 for Hadley. Party
lines were not drawn, the sensational
papers having the issue and the antis
taking it up —to their sorrow.
When the victory was announced
in Tulsa, the clean, law-abiding negro
voters held a huge parade celebrat
ing the Plan victory, as the real
American negroes realize that they
have a friend in the Ku Klux Klan.
El Reno Goes Over
In El Reno, the issue was likewise,
anti-Klan and Ku Klux Klan. Mayor
A. J. Kivett, backed by the Klan, had
a clear majority over two opponents,
one a “neutral” and the other avow
edly anti-Klan. Kivett won with 1940
votes to 887 for Collins and 115 for
Rtames. No party lines were drawn
in El Reno.
Okmulgee Elects Republican
Okmulgee put over the real politi
cal surprise by electing a republican
on a Klan ticket in a Democratic
stronghold as mayor and then send
ing in a Democratic council, all back
ed by the Klan. Republicans and
Democrats alike voted the Klan tick
et “straight.” Carpenter (Republi
can and Klansman) received 1,953
votes to 1,126 for Dickerson (anti-
Klan Democrat.) Embree, running
on a “neutral” platform, received 637
giving Carpenter a majority of 190.
The remainder of the Democratic
ticket (all backed by the Klan) were
re-elected.
No Isuue at Shawnee
At Shawnee, there was no issue,
but strangely enough a Republican
was elected mayor and the remainder
of the council elected were Demo
crats. The mayor-elect is friendly to
the Klan, and thereby hangs a tale.
All of the councilmen are friendly to
the Klan.
From over the state comes news of
other victories favorable to the Klan.
Only in towns and cities where the
rabid newspapers made the issue, did
the Klan take any part as a political
body. At this writing only one an
ti-Klan mayor has been returned and
that was in a small town in the
southern part of the state.
THIRD PARTY TO
MEET IN ST. PAUL
(Continued from page 1)
“The conditions have developed a
widespread movement by the farmers
and workers to reorganize a political
party and challenge the continued
rule of the privileged class in this
country.”
There are five points in the plat
form announced in the call, as fol
lows: public ownership of railroads,
control of money and credits through
government and co-operative banks,
public control of all natural resourc
es, restoration of civil liberties guar
anteed by the constitution, and the
abolition of the use of injunction in
labor disputes.
Representation Basis
Representation in the convention is
announced as follows:
Each state to be allowed votes equal
to its electoral vote, plus one vote
for each 5,000 votes or fraction there
of, cast for the progressive candidate
receiving the highest number of
votes in the 1922 general election.
Also, each national political organi
zation shall be entitled to five votes,
provided such organization has sub
scribed to the fundamental princi
ples announced in the call; each state
federation, central body and local or
ganization of farmers, business or
professional men shall be entitled to
one vote. Also any group of 25 or
more farmers, not represented by an
other organization, snail be entitled
to one delegate. Each state political
organization, having standing under
laws governing political parties, shall
be entitled to five delegates; where
no legal standing exists such organi
zation shall have but one delegate.
The national convention will be
unique in that there will be a series
of conventions within the conven
tion, in a sense. All the state dele
gations will have separate meetings
in various halls, either to start or
Krfect organizations for the future.
ie big convention will be held in
the St. Paul auditorium.

DEMOCRAT FILeTfOR
GOPHER GOVERNORSHIP
Michael Lambrecht’s Campaign
Slogan Is. “Let's Blot
• Out the War
The first Democratic filing for a
state or national office was made Sat
urday when Michael Lambrecht, 220
Belmont avenue, St. Paul, went to the
office of the secretary of state and
enrolled himself as a candidate for
governor.
Charles A. Lindbergh, of Little
Falls, formerly congressman from the
sixth district, became the sixth as
pirant to the Farmer-Labor guberna
torial nomination when he filed Sat
urday.
When Mr. Lambrecht arrived at
the secretary of state’s office, he left
with the office force a package of
blotters upon which were depicted
the national capitol and the slogan,
“Let’s Blot Out War.”
In a statement issued by Mr. Lind
bergh after his filing, the candidate
said:
“I stand on the platform af the
Farmer-Labor party and go further.
Minnesota has been and still is in
the grip of a financial panic. The re
sources of the state are sufficient, if
properly handled, to give us normal
conditions all the time. The gover
nor, due to the immense prestige of
his office, could engage in co-oordi
nating the affairs of the state, to
make permanent prosperity,
“I propose, if nominated and elect
ed, to do my part in leading the way,
so affairs may be co-ordinated for the
good of all the state. We cannot
wait for other states and the national
government. Minnesota has facilities
to lead, rather than to follow. I have
a plan which, I believe, will cause per
manent prosperity in the state, and
will explain this plan during the cam
paign, with literature and through
SDf>aVor«
“I urge harmony in the Farmer-La
bor party and pledge my support to
its nominees. A critical period is
upon us, and I urge all my competi
tors to join me in making the cam
paign one of its issues and fundamen
tal principles, rather than one of per
sonalities. The people have had
enough of frivolities and false prom
ises. They want constructive action
and leadership along the path of eco
nomic reconstruction. If the other
candidates share my views on this,
we can make the 1924 campaign one
that will leave the people better in
formed on the real issues and present
a united front that means a Farmer-
Labor victory in November.”
AMERICANS ELECTED
JOPLIN, MO., April 5. —From a
mass of truth and falsehood the bet
ter citizens of this city selected the
truth and placed in office representa
tive Americans, supported by Klans
men, at the recent municipal elec
tion. The entire so-called Ku Klux
Klan ticket was swept into office by
substantial majorities.
The victory was significant because
of the large foreign population. The
casting of ballots was preceded bv a
deluge of advertisements published
by the anti-Klan organization, which
not only contained statements that
were misleading, but pure falsehoods
about the great American organiza
tion, according to local Klansmen.

FREE TEXT ROOKS
URGED BY KLANSMEN
Volumes As Necessary As Are
State Paid Teachers, Says
Georgia Leader
ATLANTA, GA., April 4 A Klan
program for the Realm of Georgia
in support of free text books for ev
ery cnild in the state, regardless of
race, creed oi color; providing the
books are used in the public schools,
is promised by General N. B. Forrest,
Grand Dragon. The matter will be
laid before the Klansmen of the state
at the several Province Klonverses to
be held within the next 60 days.
In discussing free text books legis
lation and the opposition such meas
ures have met before the general as
semblies of this and other southern
states, the Grand Dragon said:
‘There is no denying that free text
books are just as essential to free ed
ucation as are state paid teachers
and state owned buildings. Those op
posing the measure have used as an
argument to Klansmen that if the
state furnished text books to white
school children it would mean fur
nishing them to colored children as
well. But this is no argument at all.
so far as Klansmen are concerned. I
might point out in this connection
that the individual Klans of Georgia
haye, on their own initiative, adopt
ed a policy of furnishing free text
books to needy families, whether that
family be white Protestant, colored
Protestant, Catholic or Jew. The on
ly stipulation in each instance being
that the children attend public
schools.”
MASONS ELECTED TO
OFFICE IN KEOKUK
Klan Burns Two Fiery Crosses
When Announcement of
Results Is Made
KEOKUK, IA.. April 5.- This city
is to have a new order of things in
the administration of municipal af
fairs as the result of the municipal
election Monday which placed new
men in office.
John R. Carpenter won over John
W. Rovane, by a vote of 4,243 to 2,673.
The positions of councilmen were
wone by William L. Kirchner. de
feated T. J. Hickey by a majority of
1,933 votes and H. M. Kesselring, who
won over W. V. Moran by polling
4,039 votes as against his opponent’s
2,466.
This was the first time in the his
tory of Keokuk that all the men
elected to municipal offices have been
Masons.
It was evident that the election re
sults were to the liking of members
of the Klan heer, for two fiery cross
es were burned in various parts of
the city when the results became
known. The crosses were lighted at
10 o’clock and both attracted many
people and caused a deal of comment.
KLAN SERVES NATION
THROUGH BALLOT BOX
Grand Dragon of Illinois Makes
Statement on Coming
Primaries
CHICAGO, ILL., April 7- That the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan is not
in politics has again been emphasized
by Chas. G. Palmer, Grand Dragon,
Realm of Illinois.
“The coming primary election in
this state brings many demands upon
our organization,” he said, “but tney
are not such demands as could be
made upon a ‘political machine.' The
opportunities for service that come
to us are of an educational and patri
otic character exclusively.
“One of the first duties of a Klans
man is to serve his country. He can
do this, sometimes, upon the fields of
battle, but he can render a continu
ous and even greater service in the
election of qualified Americans to of
fice.
“The Klan. through its educational
courses in the Klaverns, seeks to in
struct Klansmen in the proper func
tioning of the government and in
the responsibilities of citizenship.
These courses, directed by qualified
men, naturally bring about a demand
on the part of Klansmen for the
highest type of public officials and
the proper conduct of their offices.
“As individual citizens and as Kla.is
men they have the right and the priv
ilege of supporting and voting for
whomever they choose and they do,
but after months of lectures on the
constitution, American history. Civil
Government texts, etc., they naturally
vote for the better men."
Kansas Negroes Are
Friendly Toward Klan
PITTSBURG, KAN. April 7.-In
spite of the oft-told story that the
Klan is opposed to the negro, and the
anti-Klan propaganda carried on by
the local press, the thinking men and
women among the negroes of this sec
tion are convinced that their best
friends are to be found umung Klans
men. They realize that the overtures
made them by politiciana and their
henchmen are merely for votes. Un
restrricted immigration, they believe,
means more competition in the labor
market for the negro workman.
IMMIGRATION BILL
NOW BEFORE HOUSE
(Continued from page 1)
The rules committee over in the
house of representatives has brought
in a special rule under which the
house is to consider the Johnson
immigration bill. This is the kind of
a bill all good Klansmen want to see
enacted into law. It cuts the figures
down from 3 to 2 per cent and bases
the quota on the 1890 census.
It is believed the Johnson bill will
be in full swing in the house by April
7 or 8, and a big fight is anticipated.
All the pressure that can be brought
to bear by the foreign bloc In the
house, consisting of those New York
congressmen who represent foreign
constituents and about 40 or 50 other
such members. They are busy on
the job day and night. It is not hard
to understand their attitude in oppos
ing the Johnson bill; they are doing
what their Italian, Jewish and Cath
olic constituents want them to do.
On the other hand we find the mem
bers of congress who represent Amer
can constituents and red-blooded
Americans and all patriotic societies
working for Protestant America and
immigration that either bring about
a stoppage or a restricted immigra
tion. These people are being support
ed by the Knights of the Ku klux
Klan, the American Federation of La
bor, the American Legion, and all
kinds of Protestant organizations, in
cluding the churches and churchmen.
The reason bolshevistic propogan
da has never made headway in this
country is on account of the prosper
ous condition of our working class
es, who have proved a bulwark against
all foreign and radical propaganda.
Let down the bars on immigration
and you will help to make the United
States another Russia, and no good
American wants that.
During the past 16 years New York
city has seen the entry of hundreds
of thousands of emigrants from Euro
pean countries and Russia. Many of
them have been very undesirable cit
izens. The influx from the southern
Europe and Russia has made New
York more than a cosmopolitan city;
it is almost a foreign colony, domi
nating politics, courts, and filling
jails, penitentiaries, insane asylums
and otner such institutions. A peru
sal of the New York City papers
shows daily crimes and mostly by for
eigners. New York has its daily mur
ders.
Numerous hold-ups are perpetrat
ed by foreigners from the south of
Europe and Russia, and the only re
lief for the United States is limited
immigration. Wonder what New’
York city, Boston, Philadelphia,
Baltimore and other eastern cities,
will be like in ten years, if a check
is not made upon the entry of these
hordes of undesirables who flood our
eastern cities, with more desiring to
come all the time. One report is that
another 10,000,000 people from rav
aged Europe seek to come to the
United States. Do we want them?
Americanism is challenged right
now, and the middle west and the
far west ought to wake up to real
conditions and help put a stop to this
thing before it is too late.
A powerful foreign following has
thrown down the gauntlet. What are
Americans going to do about it?
URGE LEGISLATION
TO HELP CRIPPLED
(Continued from page 1)
The work will be done in co-opera
tion with child welfare organization
everywhere. Mrs. Jones is sending
out an official urge to every state re
lief corps president asking that a
committee De appointed to investi
gate state laws regarding children,
find out if they are adequate, if child
life is safeguarded, if laws are en
forced, and if not, the cause.
“We should be awake to the act
that the only tribute that will live
is our contribution to the child life
of America," says Mrs. Jones. “We
must find the needs of every state;
make a survey of the number of crip
pled children in every community
and report their needs. There is a
way to help every crippled child, if
not back to normality, at least to
more comfort and a greater degree
of independence industrially and so
cially. Every county in in the Unit
ed States has its crippled boys and
girls who can be helpea if the women
will do it."
Mrs. Jones will attend the national
woman’s relief coims cronvenltlon to
be held in Boston, Massachusetts, next
June, and will make recommenda
tions for work by the national organi
zation and every state relief corps
body. She addressed the last session
of the National Vocational Education
convention at the request of the Fed
eral Board of Rehabilitation on the
“Care and Education of the Crippled
child from a Social Worker’s View
point."
It was through Mrs. Jones’ work
that the last session of the North
Dakota legislature passed an appro
priation to care for crippled boys
and girls. Mrs. Jones is supervising
most of these cases heself. She be
gan the work because of the results
of treatment of her own daughter,
crippled from infantile paralysis and
now an honor student in Simmons
college. Boston.
‘There were more than 800 cripples
in North Dakota alone when we made
our survey," Ms. Jones said, “and it is
nrohabTfe that every state has a num
ber proportionate to its population.
Economically a life is worth $7,000,
so that by curing the 200,000 crippled
children which we have in our land,
we should be adding $1,400,000 to the
productive power of society." Mrs.
Jones is working with the Shriners,
having many of her case* cared for
at the Shriners* hospital in Minneap
olis, and her work is also supported
by the Kiwaniana. She plans to visit
relief corps of Minnesota again and
speak on the need of the work.

FIGHT IN SELF DEFENSE
Twenty-Four Men Under Arrest
on Charge of Riot, Gun Car
rying and Murder
By 8. THOM AS ZENER, Jr.
(Serial Telegram to The Fiery Cross)
LILLY, PA., April 7.—This lit
tle mining town today assumed
a belligerent, anti-Protestant at
titude after a restless Sunday fol
lowing the attack upon Cambria
county Klansmen Saturday night
after they had burned a cross
on an overlooking hillside.
Strangers within these borders
are regarded w’ith utter suspi
cion, and the religion of anyone
seeking information is closely
questioned. The situation has
assumed a religious status en
tirely.
At Johnßtown, 20 miles west, 24
alleged Klansmen are held without
bail in the county jail. Charges of
carrying concealed weapons, riot and
murder were charged against them
before Alderman Levergood Monday.
Three Klansmen, Worthy Davis,
Johnstown; Sarrah Johnson, Revlock,
and Samuel Evans, Southfork, are in
the Memorial hospital there, suffering
from wounds received in the melee
Saturday night. None of them is se
riously injured.
Took Special Train
Cambria county Klansmen boarded
a special train at Johnstown Saturday
night and came to Lilly. Upon ar
rival the Klan members marched to a *
field near the town and burned a fiery
cross. While the ceremony was in
progress, two men attempted to en
tei the field, around which a cordon
of robed Klansmen had been sta
tioned. They were frustrated in their
attempt. There was no initiation
service at the field.
In an orderly fashion, the Klansmen
marched back to the special train,
which was waiting for them on a sid
ing. During the march two women,
Anna M. Hanna and Esther Hanna,
said to be Klanswomen, cheered the
men. They were attacked by a mob
of ruffians who had gatherd along
the line of march. Esther suffered a
broken leg, and is said to be in a crit
ical condition.
Jeered and Hissed
Nearing the railroad tracks, which
are separated from the town by a low
fence, the Klansmen were the objects
of jeers and hisses from a large crowd
of local miners and townspeople who
had gathered to threaten them.
A group of men ran from a side
street carrying a section hose. This
was attached to a fire hydrant and a
forceful stream of water turned onto
the peacefully marching Klansmen.
One member of the Klan delegation
stepped out of the ranks and gave
battle. He succeeded in stopping the
stream of water.
The first shot was fired by some
one in the mob. This was the signal
for the riot and the townspeople
crowded around the Klansmen and a
general melee followed. The Cam
bria county men were mobbed.
Italians Fired Shot
Witnesses declared that an Italian,
described as “portly" fired the first
shot from the doorway of a near-by
house.
In the riot two men were killed.
They are:
Philip Conrad, aged 25, Catholic,
Lilly.
Cloyd Paul, aged 27, Protestant,
Lilly.
Six men were seriously wounded
and are in danger of dying. They are
Frank Miasco, Patrick Bradley, Fran
cis Appalucci, Raymond Bradley, An
drew Marcinko and Clarence Patter
son. These men were in the mob that
attacked the Klansmen.
Mob Disperses
When the Klan members defended
themselves and put up resistance to
the attack, the mobbers quickly dis
persed. Maimed and injured Klans
men boarded their train and returned
immediately to Johnstown. Upon ar
ival, officers met the special train,
searched the crowd and every man
aboard. It is reported that the crowd
gathered at the station also threat
ened the returning Klan members.
Twenty-four of the delegation were
then arrested.
Residents of Lilly Monday threat
ened the sister-in-law of Cloyd Paul,
the murdered man. Unknown van
dals early Monday morning poured
oil on the crepe on the door of Paul’s
residence.
M. K. Piper, president of the First
National bank, rented a wagon to the
visitors in which to carry the wood
en cross to the hillside where it was
burned. As a consequence, a run on
the bank is reported.
