The Centenary College i. situated in
*tcksen, La., ,.::(re it was founded on
the centennial anniversary of Methodism
in -meriea in C lintna, Mi-s., in 1825 and
removed in Jacks 1, ,La.. in 1845. It is
now pryis'-ed t5 reminve this college to
Shreveport. fr which as a business
proposition there nall he required a site
<U thirty five ac e- be}, 1nd the corporate
limits bute within ea-y access of the city,
besides a bonus of i0oo0ooo. The man
agement is to erect an edifice a, a cost
of $50,000. At a meeting held Monday
afternornn at which oas considered the
propositinn, a comnittee on ways and
mean, was appointed comprising Dr. J.
P. Scott, S'. E. Gla-sell, J. H. Shepherd,
Henry Nimuree and S. B. McCutchen. In
viewing at a glance this proposition, the
inipre>miAn stay he that the terms are
exhorlitatt. but when computed from
the advantages and the benefits which
are to be derived in the future the spirit
of progress would recommend approval.
lTbe-e was a period in the history of
Shrevey!ort when such a proposition.
Ã½would have sihiKked the people breath.
!essly, but every progressive citizen has
long since recognized the fact that money
in enterpri-es which give reasonable in
dication of 1'rotitabAe returns is well in
vested. Ihe 'entenary College, if located
in or neat shreveport, would be a direct
contributor to the increased develop.
meint oi this city and in time other sim
ilar institutions would become identified
with ehe growth of a wide-awake and `
progressive cotmtnutity. Why should not
Shreveport become an educational as it
is now a &iilrotad center of importance?
From a practical business standpoint
Shreveport should secure this college'
which is now under the management of
Rev. H. - B. Carre, an able and ardentl
worker in the cause of education, a "n
distinguished for his noble character and.'
who is held in the highest esteem, ands
with Â¶uim are connected in the movement
to locate tOte college at Shreveport:
