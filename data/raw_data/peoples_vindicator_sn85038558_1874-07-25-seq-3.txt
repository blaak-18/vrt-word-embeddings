THE NEGRO TEE AGGRESSOR !
Kangaroos On the Rampage I
th,.ME, CI.A1BOR.E PARISII, TIlE sCENEI'
OF THE FIRST DIE.MVlONTRAT'I(ON.
From the mail rider from Minden
and Homer we learn some of the par
ticulars of what came neuar resulting
in a pitched battle.
It seems that upon Saturday, 11th
inst., while the negroes from the ad
joining country were in the townl of
Honmer in erowds, as is usual upon
that day, being the time that they are
relieved by contract from work, and
do their trading and whiskey drink
ing, a negro man had a personal dif
$icnlty with a white man, a barber;
The negro called the white man a d-d
lying s- of--- &c., and drew his
revolver to shoot, it is supposed, the
white mosa instantly drew his and
killed the negro. Whereupon, the
negroes in the town immediately re
paired in as body, numbering over two
hundred, to the vicinity of where the
shooting occured and demanded that
the white man should be delivered to
tIhem that they might take vengance
for having killed one of their colori.
The white citizens immediately met
and required the negroes 'to leave the
town in fifteen minutes, 'truich they
,lid precipitately.
Trouble was still anticipated and
the citizens were fully prepared to
neet the immergeucy. What does
M r,(?) Kellogg say now !
.I'DGE XIvYEst IN TIlE ROLE OF CON
.!IcA'ioN.-Sonle three years since,
Van D)usen took possession of a va
i'ant house belonging to Mrs. I'erot
on Three League Bayou, for use as a
ro.lored school house, without so much
as saying "by your leave," to the"
owner. Last fall, MIrs. Perot inform
ed the gentleman that she had use fot
the house, and lie must vacate, which
he promised her lto would do. But
uponl his coining to town and relating,
Me suppose, the facts of the case to
.1 udge Myers, who by the way, is also
'rTreasurer of our immaculate school
heard ; that individual wrote a letter
to the lady in question, and informed
her that he had authority from the
State to buy or lease any property
which might be required for school
lpurposes and should she see fit not to
dispose of her property on those terms
lie would take it any rway. One by
u,ne, the acts, brazen and damnable
of these individuals comes to light
and each sncceeding one seem a msore
gross violation of rights and liberty
than the other. The letter alluded to
can be produced if required, and we
..onsider, if our people desire to re
lain some little semblanee of liberty,
they had better see into this and oth
.er matters the "upright judge" has
been engaged in.
.  4D41m--- -.-.
The citizens of our parish interested,
will bear in mind that upon Monday,
immediately after the meeting of the
lieform Association, a meeting is
called to organize the White Lengue.
A full attendance is desired, as we
must give this movement all our at
tention. Come one, come all, ye
white men who desire4the government
Sin the hands of your race.
Cry it to the World.
From the X. O. Picayaune.
We cannot comprehend or sympa
thize with the objections and remion
strances which have greeted the ap
pearance, on a simple and navarnish
4d pltaform, of the White Man's par
ty., We echo none of the complaints
against its frankness, we share none
of the fears which some have sought
to found upon its rigor and its unre
served enunciation of purpose and of
prineiple; It is plain to our mind
and should be equally plain to every
hody elee's-that the White Man's
party as now developed is the party
we have been seeking, lo! these many,
weary yearser. It is the Phanix of the
Diemocracy save only the ashes of the
ldd embarrassments, the dead issues,
the trauitss traditions and the fatal
impracticebllities whlich have always
clogged and defeated it in the past.
It ieses tobma fresh from our sorrows
and miisfotrhnes, theim creature of ex
istng fagts, the awful corollary of
thlttpr6cess which has well nigh
wrought oar ruain, The excesses, the
oppression., the reckless and brutal
wrsmanagement of the Radical era
have given it birth; and the fierce
heat in which it erystalised has shriv
eled stud coasamed all save the eter
nal germ of self-preservation.
If the ascheme of this party con
templates the neglect of all other oh
-jects; if it ignores cvery isesue which
does not bear rudely and directly
upon the question of our present res
cue; if it lorgets old services, post
pones old debts and shuts out ancient
obligations.-does it eexceed the grim
necessities of the erisist If it says
openly that we reust end the negroes'
rule, does it say in words more than
other parties have been saying in ef
uuct? If it declares the solemn and
unalterable purpose of casting out
the tools as well no the, workmen who
have reared this ghastlh fabric of mis
government and apohation, dloes it
proclaim one aim that every L.oisi
nanian's bosom does not cherish--one
aspiration that the whole people of
the realh will approve? Our evil
plight has become at bitter and crying
shanie throughout the land. All men
see and deplore the effect, and if we,
knowing the cause, elect to strike
fairly and gallantly at its -root, who
shall say us nay t
- What would these faint-hearted
triinmers have ? They talk of North
ern sympathy! Do they think it pos
sible to drag that mockin, phantom
frotaits grave and hold it up to men
who struggle with a living foe ? Com
merei, and the thingsof 18t6! Where
has our commerce strayed before this
dead Im hdrricane, and what fruits
shallI Louisiana live to gather from
the tilds of 187( unless the blight of
1874 ie checked ?
It pecms to uis that men must be
strangely blind to urge such things at
such a time. There is no need to
screen one single fraction of our pir
pose. Our cause is just, its aims are
open to the "gaze of men, and that
Northern sympathym whereqf we hear
so much is far more likely to attend
us thus than in any weakness or un
manly subterfuge. We seek to wrest
no privilege from ile.n~egro,; we have
not i1, the utmost flights of our de
sign the theft of any of hi.4, liberties.
It is simply a question whether we
shall permit him to perfect the deso
Intio4 he has instituted; whether the
owners of this State, the patrons of
its enterprises, the motive powers of
its progress, shall give ili up to li
cense and obliteration. This is the
severe and simple platform of the
White Man's party here. The world
is ftre to know it all, and those who
tell us that the world will blame it,
however slightly, are eitlher selfish
traito√Ω:s with our failure at their
hearts, or timid weaklings whom we
must pot know in this dark hour of
strife.
[Conununin(ited.
The Railroad Question.
dr.. Editor :-Your railro;al figures
of last week are, of course, 'eorrect as
an arithmaetical calculation. unt as Mr.
Gradgriud failed to d(evelop the bet
ter qalities of human nature b1 re
ducing humtan action to a stiict arith
retical standard, so, it seems to me,
you hlave narrowed down your cal
celathin to a limit which does not do
full justice to the raiJroad question.
If it "cannot be dlcmionstrated that
there cis likely to be some reciprocal
benefit to be received by the people
for the proposed donation, then we
had better reject it at once, whether
it is $3140,000 or $800,0(00.
Let us admit that your figures are
correct, and that the town and parish
must eventually pay $628,001) in b ynds
and interest. Of this sum the own
must pay 8276,000, and the parish
$552,0101)-within twenty years.
No man can doubt that the town
will be compensated for its donation
long before twe expiration of th term,
by
lst,,The special and temporary in
crease of business in every depart
ment,'from the building of the road
through the parish, from money spent,
here by the employes of the road, de
rived from grading, cross-ties, trestle
work, culverts. the construction of
depots and other works, &c.
dr, The permanent increase of bus
iness, attracted from new souirces by
tlte facilities offered for trade and
travel by our (at present) inland town.
' 3d, Tle rise of value in town pro
perty, especially in rents.
4th, The influxof new people and
new wealth, to help us hbear oar Ire
sentt local burdens, as well as to shalre
with us the playment of the proposed
donation.
5thl, It is a matter of life or death
to the town. If the road shouild miss
it even by half a dozen miles, its fate
would be forever sealed.
The donation by the parish stands
upon a different ground; but by as
snming a very reasonable basis of
probable development, it can be
shown that the $552,000 will not be a
very grievous burden to the present
plopulation-if, indeed, it cannot be
demonstrated, that, apart from the
general benefits to be derived from
the road, it will be no burden at all.
In support of the argument, it is
necessary to view the questiort from
a single stand-point only-that is,
the accession of new wbalth by new
owners, within the average of ttetuty
years. First, then, Sec. 19 of the
Act incorporating the La. Central
Railway, provides for the taxation of
the road according to total value of
stock compared with its " 1in eal
length" through any parish. The cost
of construction within this parish will
be very nearly a million of doll'ars,
and it is fair to assume that the assess
ment will be for half that amount.
Thus, the road itself will bear one
third of our local taxes from the very
beginning. Next, it,is certainly rea
sonable to presume that other new
wealth will amount to half a million
more-if not, we should reject tihe
donation without hesitation, and go
on in our old slip-shod way, a century
behind the civilization of the world,
buried in our little Acadia of rural
felicity, "the world forgetting, by the'
world forgot." If this second as
sumption be admitted, then we should
have a new accession of wealth of
$1,000,000--equal to the present va
luation of property within the parish.
This new wealth would relieve the
parish of the half the tax in behalf of
the donation, or $276,000-leaving
the same amount to be paid by the
present population of the parish. This
new accession of wealth would, per
coatro, pay one half the parish taxes,
or $300,000, within the same time,
without materially augmenting the
parish expenses-leaving a small bal
Sance in favor of the people, to be ad
ded to the general benefit to be de
rived from the road. And, as Mr.
Gradgrind'sfigures could not encom
Spass the whole scope of human action,
and control the emotions and passions
Sof the hutuan heart, so our rsateacan
not compute all the advantages whiclt
may be derived frolm a railroad
through the parish and town. A wider
range of thought than is laid down in
our aritiumctics must be given to the
subject, and it must be viewed froim
all sides in the effulgent blaze of the
material civilization of the nineteenth
century.

The Saturday Evening Post.
The Oldest and liest Story Paper Pub
lilhed. ,
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, :ul hasI ever borne a
widespread and unhlemished reputation
for the unsnrpassed purity. retinement
and excellence of the Serials. Sketches
and Miscellaneous reading matter.
It is pre-eminently
The Best Family Paper
that is published in thiscountry, from its
never containing anything that would
offend the feelings of any one, either in
a religions or political sense, or that
could not heI read at any fireside without
objection from the most fastidious.
The circulation of the Saturday Even
ing Post, through not quite so large
perhaps, as its younger contemporaries,
is not, like that of some of them, fluctu
ating, and too often short-lived, but
SURE,. SOLID ANrD SUBSTANTIAL,
based upon the intrinsic merit of the pa
per itself, and not dependent on any ex
traneous influences, such as the populari
ty of individual writers, &c.
Good, however, as the Saturday Even.
ing Post has been in the past, it is our
intention to make it still better in the
future, and with this object in view we
will effect a marked improvement in eve
ry department of the paper, and will
call to our assistance writers of admitted
ability and knowlt reputatioh.
By increaging its former attractions,
and adding many judicious and pleas
ing novelties, by studying how to please
and cultivate the popnular taste, byv in,
creasing indistry and enterprise, and by
enlarged facilities, we hope to make new
