MAYFIELD CASE SHOWS UP TRAITORS
TWILIGHT’S
THINKLINGS
IN THE KLAVERN
THE TEACHER
A FATHER'S OPPORTUNITY
IN THE KLAVERN:
We meet leavin (/outside the guard
ed door the marks of rank and the
emoluments of office. Every sugges
tion of inferiority and sujjerionty
is forbidden a /dace iw "our sacred
cave." We are one in the Great
Cause.
IN THE KLAVERN:
Honor, love and justice must actu
ate us all. Selfishness, “the festive
queen among human kind," is for
bidden to /muss as she knocks staking
entrance. Here the “holy light of
chivalry ’’ shines in all its glory.
IN THE KLAVERN:
W meet face to face with men who
are moveil by worthy motives ami as
pire to all things noble. A wonderful
Brotherhood is assembled for the pur
pose of planning ways and means for
more effcctiw living in a land that
God has so richly blessed.
IN THE KLAVERN:
We pay tribute to Him who died on
the Cross of Cali'ary for the regnera
tion of mankind. In humble prayer
we kneel and acknowledge our de
pendence upon God. We pray for
strength and courage amt v;isdom so
that we may walk the highways and
byuHiys of the alien world us true fol
lowers of the Nazarene.
IN THE KLAVERN:
We hear the faithful Kludd s/nak
the oracles of God —"Thou slialt wor
ship the Lord thy God. Render unto
the state the things whie are the
state's. Love the brotherhood; honor
the king. Bear one another's burdens,
mnd so fulfill the law of Christ." The
Klokard reminds us that "honor to a
Klunsman is more than life."
IN THE KLAVERN:
We haw bten dedicated, in body,
in mind, in spirit, and in life, to the
holu .y vice of our country, ou,
homes, each other and humanity. *v«
haw learned our place and our u'ork,
so let us ever live in harmony with
God's will and purpose in our cre

I DON’T care how much a commun-
Itv spedns for school buildings.
If the teaching staff Is not com
petent, the school Is worth very lit
tie THE TEACHER MAKES THE
SCHOOL EITHER HOOD OR HAD.
The more thoroughly the American
people come to understand tills fact,
the better schools we will provide for
American boys and girls. Too much
stress cannot be placed on the im
portance of efficient teachers In the
public school.
The teacher works with the most
wonderful thing In creation-the
mind of a human being. Vet we per
mit men and women to serve as
teachers who are absolutely unlit lor
the work that a teacher Is called up
on to do in the schoolrooms of the
nation. By our short-sighted policies
we are driving good teachers Into
commercial Helds where the remuner
at lon Is more satisfactory. Hequent
|y we force the teachers of this coun
try to work and live under condi
tions that do everything but make
the teaching profession attractive. I
have served as a teacher and school
executive, so know whereof 1 write.
It Is shameful the way we Americans
have compelled teachers to accept
mountains of discouragement, over
work. uncertainties of tenure of of
fice, and wrecked nervous systems
with premature old age, for mone
tary returns that continuously sug
gest the poorhouse and charity. Do
you suppose for a minute tliat red
blooded men and women of ability
are goln gto continue In the profes
sion of education with an outlook
that Is no better than that of the
coal miner or Ignorant
What Is the result of our foolishness.
Consider the following facts:
30,000 teachers In our public
schools have no education beyond the
eighth grade In the elementary
wh°ol. . . ,
100,000 teachers have had less than
two years of education beyond the
eighth grade.
200,000 teachers have less than a
high school education.
300,000 teachers have no more than
• high school education. 300,000
teachers have little or no prepara
tion fo rthe work that they are at
tempting to do In the schoolrooms of
the land.
BEING a father gives a man a
splendid opportunity to
serve in a wonderful way. _ The
children of today are the citizens
of tomorrow, into whose hands
the weal of a nation will be
placed. If fathers have done
their duty within the walls of
their homes, we need not fear
for the future. Christian men
and women come from homes
where parents follow 111 MlO loot'
steps of Jesus. When the teach
ings of the Christ have no defi
nite place in the home, it is diffi

Christianity. It is in the home

Salvation Army Receives Dona*
tion from Fergus Falls,
Minn., Organization
FERGUS FALLS, MINN., May 12. -
On a recent Sunday evening, Captain
Larson, of the local unit, Salvation
Army, found an envelope on her pul
pit and, upon opening it, discovered
a letter and the sum of S2B. On
reading the letter, Miss Larson
learned that the Ottertail county
Klan had donated the money. The
letter presented the principles of the
Ku Klux Klan briefly, and an indorse
ment of the work being done by the
Salvation Army in this city. Captain
Larson seemed pleasantly surprised
and said she was very glad that an
organization was working in this
community for the principles for
which the Klan stands.
A week ago Sunday, just as the col
lection had been taken at the Breck
enridge Baptist church, 30 robed
Klansmen entered and walked down
the aisle to the pulpit. The spokes
man of the Klan gave the Rev.
Charles H. Davies an envelope con
taining over SBO.OO. With the dona
tion was a letter praising the effect
ive work which is being done by the
Rev. Mr. Davies in Breckenridge, and
encouraged the continuance of his
activities. The Baptist pastor has
met with much opposition from those
who do not believe in united Prot
estantism.

Minnesota Congressman Is
Tried in Virginia on
Statutory Charges
HEARING TOOK 2 DAYS
Colleagues from Gopher State
Serve as Character Wit
nesses in His Behalf
WASHINGTON, D. C., May 12-
Representative Harold Knutson of
Minnesota was found not guilty by a
jury recently in Arlington county,
Virginia, of serious charges filed
against him last March by three Vir
ginia police officers who arrested
him when in an automobile with Le
roy M. Hull, a Washington govern
ment clerk.
The case occupied two days, and
the jury on receiving it deliberated
more than an hour and took three
ballots. Immediately on announce
ment of the verdict the common
wealth attorney entered a motion
dismissing the case against Hull.
Knutson, commenting on the result
declared that it was what he had ex
pected, and that he had been con
fident of the outcome right along.
Police Only Accusers
Evidence during the trial consisted
for the prosecution of testimony by
police officers, patrolling the Vir
ginia roads, of how they had found
the parked automobile, which both
Knutson and Hull denied specifically
the charges.
Representatie Knutson’s defense al
so included the appearance of several
of his colleagues in the house of rep
resentatives who testified as charac
ter witnesses. Representative Fish
of New York drew a round of ap
plause from the crowded court room
when he stated that he was appear

POLICE FAIL TO FIND
WEAPONSONKLANSMEN
Chief Collins* Braves Make Val
iant Effort to Enforce
the Law
CHICAGO, ILL., May 12. In a fu
tile effort to find revolvers, pistols
or other “evidence” upon which to
base a charge of unlawful assembly,
a police detail from the Austin av
enue station, one night last week,
searched several hundred Klansmen
as they entered the meeting place of
the Ku Klux Klan in the Austin dis
trict. Needless to say. not a single
“gun” was found by the energetic
coppers, nor was any other incrimi
nating “evidence” found in the pos
session of the Klansmen.
Among those “frisked” were high
officials of the Realm, and of the
Province, as well as scores of the
most representative business and pro
fessional men of the district. A
number of ministers experienced the
sensation of a close “frisk.”
While the meeting was delayed by
the activities of Chief Collins' law
enforcers, it eventually proceeded.
Members of the Klan are sworn to
aid and uphold officers of the law in
the performance of their duties, but
they do not expect to be denied their
legal right of lawful assemblage be
cause of the whim of someone who
hoped to “get something on the Ku
Kluxers.”
It is doubtful if any other group of
more than 500 men drawn from dif
ferent sections of the city, excepting
those attending Protestant church
services, would be entirely free from
“pistol toters.” This was the record
made at the Austin Klan meeting
when each arrival was searched with
out warning as he entered the ante
room of his Klavern.

DULUTH, MINN.. May 8. The Du

any community in St. Louis county,
and, therefore, has set its machinery
of propagation for some real accom

“If Virginia or Hlbbln* think that
they can best us when it comes to re
sults those cities are somewhat mis
taken,” said a very active worker of
the Duluth organization tonight
when told what tne Range towns are
doing. The lecture delivered tonight
by a state speaker of the Klan was
merely the finishing touch of splen

done during the week. “We are off;

ST. PAUL, MINN., May 12. Pro
test against the portrayal of so much
crime, immorality and brutality in
the movies was voiced last Tuesday
by the delegates to the twenty-eighth
annual convention of the National
Congress of Mothers and Parent-
Teacher’s associations, at the open
business session at the St. Paul hotel.
The motion picture round table
and the discufcsion/»f.better films led
by Mrs. Charles fc. Verriam of Chi
cago, chairman of the better films
committee for the organization,
proved of deep interest to the dele
gates, because proper recreation and
entertainment is one of the impor
tant questions before the convention.
Salacious Rooks Under Fire
Persistent filming of the most sa
lacious books ever written is the
most significant phase of the motion
picture problem in the past year.”
Mrs. Merriam said.
“We have protested in vain, and
ever, today the industry is filming
two more vile books —books that the
average boy and girl otherwise never
would have heard about. One of
these is about to be released this
week. The producer of this film an
nounce? that this week, which we are
devoting to child welfare, is to be
nationally advertised by him as Move
week.’
“The industry tells us that we
should not mention these bad films,
that we should spend our time adver
tising and praising their good films.
You might as well say that the com
munity should pay no attention to
its criminals and spend its time
praising its good citizens.
“Has the foundation of law and or
der been based on this principle of
praising the good qualities of our
criminals and not punishing them for
their crimes?
“Our government is formed to pro
tect the innocent, law-abiding citizen
from the guilty criminal not to

Lexington, 111., Klan
Members Visit Church
LEXINGTON, ILL., May 12. On a
recent Sunday night, whije a large
congregation at the Christian church
at Cooksville was singing “The Old
Rugged Cross,” 27 Klansmen entered
the church, marched down the aisle
and faced the good people. Upon the
conclusion of the song one of the
Klansmen read the 12th chapter of
Romans. The Klansmen then faced
the minister, while one of their num
ber presented him with an envelope
containing a liberal donation. The
visitors knelt in prayer at the altar
and the minister offered a prayer.
They arose, found seats, and remained
for the services.

formal statement issued recently,
said that he will not be a canuidate
for nomination for any office at the
coming primary.
Mr. Collins said he is making this
statement “in fairness to my friends
and fairness to candidates for office.”
The expense and time involved in
seeking public office under the pri

to men who must rely on a business

riend of Senator Mayfield, of Texas,
ore and disappointed because he
ould not get the senator’s influence
o make him Mayfield’s successor on
he commission when the latter came
o the senate. w r as the first Peddy
witness to testify against Senator
Vlayfield when the subcommittee of
ihe Senate Committee on privileges
and elections began its public hear
ings in Washington.
McNamara reiated alleged conver
sations with Senator Maytield as far
back as July, 1921, declaring that the
senator importuned him to go out
and raise $30,000 for him to use in
the campaign for the senate. He al
so told of other conversations in
which he charged that the senator de
manded that he raise $5,000 that
week and that Mayfield pointed out
certain oil operators of wealth who
ought to contribute.
McNamara declared that Senator
Mayfield had told him of spending
SBO,OOO that far in the campaign and
must have more money. Yet upon
cross examination it developed that
McNamara never raised a dollar of
his own volition. and he told Whe
committee that he had never seen
any money raised or contributed or
ever had handled any money with the
exception of S2OO, which he claims
was given him by Police Commission
er A. A. Morrison. It was later on
shown that of this S2OO that four
or five of Mayfield’s friends had con
tributed that small sum of money
and one of the contributors was a
former school friend of Mayfield and
that he gave SSO to help the senator.
McNamara testified that he had
«ent this S2OO to Senator Mayfield at
the latter’s headquarters in the Ori
ental hotel at Dallas by registered
letter and that he had received a
registered card from Mayfield in re
turn but neither he nor his attor
neys could produce the receipt be
fore the committee. Senator May
field contends that he never received
that S2OO, and that he was cheated
out of even that small help.
Letters which the witness read in
to the Record from Mayfield did not
contain a particle of evidence that
Mavfield ever received the S2OO con
tribution or any other money. Mc-

alleged to have taken place between
him and Mayfield at Waco, Austin.

MONTICELLO PAPER LEAVES OUT CHURCH

MONTICELLO, IA. May 12. There

The Express boasts of the fact that
it published 25 columns of news. But
it overlooked the churches altogether
as of being of no interest or impor
tance. However, the following item
wns published, maliciously lying
about the Klan, which is the one uni

“The representatives of the

(Harm u of I‘ublk-nlion m 4 Mn«ill«n)
WASHINGTON, D. C., May 10.
—“This seems to be a battle be
tween the outs and the ins,“ is
the way one fellow expressed it
at the Mayfield hearings going on
at the capitol before the subcom
mittee on privileges and elec
tions. This remark was caused
by the testimony of Robert L
Henry, of Houston, formerly a
member of congress for twenty
years, a former KJansman by his
own word, and a candidate for
the senate who was defeated by
Senator Mayfield in the primary
for nomination.
Another case of sour ((rapes on the
stand was Irwin J. Clark, of Houston,
former district jud((e, a member of
the Klan from October, 1921, to De
cember, 1922, former Great Titan of
Texas, an organizer of the Klan
throughout Texas, and later general
counsel for the Man in the Realm of
Texas. About the only Klan secrets
that Judge Clark did not disclose on
the stand was that he wanted to go
higher in the organization and be
made general counsel for the entiea
organization and alary

menr and consequently reigned be
cause as he put it he did not feel that
he couid longer remain a Klansman
and be an American citizen.
One of the committee asked him if
he did not consider himself an Amer
ican citizen while he was a member
of the Klan and doing all the work
that he had just recited he had done.
“We’d better not go into that,"
said Senator Watson, of Indiana, “it
might lead to too many interesting
questions.”
The fact that it took so long for
Judge Clark to find out that he was
an American citizen at the same time
he was a Klansman drawing good
money for influential and prominent
work, shows the type of men the Klan
under the present administration has
been obliged to get rid of. Thus the
motive of Judge Clark’s testimony is
shown in advance. None of it was
in any way damaging to Senator May
field, as it pertained mostly to Klan
business and a giving away of se
crets which Judge Clark took an
oath at one time never to reveal. No
V asonic pretender in this country
ever morg wilfully violated his sacred
jath than did Judge Clark violate his
vftth to the Klan. The fact'that he
has resigned and is no longer a mem
ber does not excuse him for telling
Klan business and Klan secrets any
more than it would for a former Ma-
