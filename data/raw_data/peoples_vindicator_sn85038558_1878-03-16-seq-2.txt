Democracy--A Contrast.
The utter failure of the (4enural
Assembly to not only relieve the peo
pile from the effect of Radical govern
ment, but to hearken to their impera
tive demands by calling a Constitu
tional Convention, should not be, nor
must not be attributed to the Democ
racy-nor to those of the mass who
were, and are the Democrats that de
feated Radicalism.
The Democratic party is essential
ly a people's party-a poor and rich
man's party-and its legislation has
always been to protect the poor from
the rapacious exactions of the rich.
That embraces the whole science of
human government. The ignorant
and the poor are the weak, and have
always been tyranized over by the
rich, because they are the powerful,
and it is to protect the weak from the
strong, that social governments are
organized.
In the General Assembly just ad
journed, there were not fifty Demo
crats, per se, all told; while the State
officials of that party do not number
a half dozen. A vicious faction of
our people-trained in duplicity and
trickery, has managed to ride into
power on the broad backs of the
honest Democratic yoemanry of our
commonwealth.
The people generally understand
this and have yet faith in the Demo
cratic party and principles. Conser
vatism was never popular with the
mass of mankind, because it is a
creed in direct conflict with every
day life. Existence is one continued
aggressive battle, and to cease the
struggle leaves the wretch to starva
tion.
A party of individuals can never
raise higher than-the individual, and
that party which exists but to temper
and trim to the vagaries of the mob;
to drift along seeking its ease only,
and claiming the virtue of the phari
see, is doomed to ignominious disas
ter, and the people who submit to
its administration will achieve nought
but degredation and ruin.
Twelve months of "Conservative
rule" in Louisiana has convinced
thinking men, however much the
smoothed tongued sirens of tlat fac
tion thay have lulled them for the
moment, of the utter hopelessness of
practical benefits being derived from
other than men of steadfast princi
ples.
The "Conservatives" in the General
Assembly have been arrayedl should
er to shoulder with the vile minions
of Radicalism who have plundered
Louisiana for a decade, in direct war
against the mass of her honest citi
zens. This the people fully under
stand, and they have judged the
"Conservatives" by that token.
There is no escaping the verdict
Conservatism has vaulted high and
o'erleaped itself.
Born of the loins of demogoguery
it draws its blood from cowardly in
action, lives its brief life in utter
contempt of all steadfast convictions
and virtue, and after retarding the
growth of government and debasing
public morals, it dies detested by all
men of honor and principle. The
"Conservative element" has well
nigh reached an ignominious end
in this State-and if the people es
cape the cltoebes of the Radical par
ty, killed on the field by the Demo
cratic host in 1876 and resuscitated
in court by the lick-spittle Conserva
tives in 1877, it will be a miracle.
Fifteen Days.
The Democrats of the General
Assembly must now assume the lead
ership and legislate as party men for
party purposes.
If they do not-the fifteen days ex
tra session will be the mill stone
which will drag them and their party
to the depths of defeat and humilia
tion.
And Governor Nicholls! you must
be terribly obtuse if you have not
learned a lesson from this sixty days
legislative experience just passed. Do
yeon not see that this great(!) "peo
ple's party" of which you were so
weak as to dream, is purely a chime
ra t The Radicals and negroes have
tickeledyour vanity and grossly de
ceived yeou. They lue never disband
d, and never will as long as a plan
dering Constitution remains to tempt
their cupidity. Parties and parti
sans are necessary to our torm of
government-a man must be one
thing or the other, and no better
evidence is wanted of that, than the
utter failure of your administration
so far.
Let us then have fifteen days of
red hot Democracy-if we do, good
results will follow, and the people
will cheerfolly pay the expenses.
Polities.
Let as have less of Conservatism
ad more of partisan polities for the
neut flteen days, and a good resault
will be the effect.
Pass the apportionment bill!
Call a Conatitational Convention
1 ithout Principle.
The toady element in Louisiana, is,
without doubt, the most vicious be
cause the most debasing class in our
commonweath. The teachings of
this body, a mnajority of whom we
are pained to admit have by soIme
hocus plikus managed to get to the
front, can end only in the demoraliza
tion of our honor, and the servileness
of the growing generation.
Rank cowardice is a fit and necessa
ry ingredient for the "toady." lMan
hood must be debased in order to be
of the "charmed circle" to whom
Sherman and Ilayes-Gartield and
Foster, feelingly refer as the "best
element in Louisiana."
These are hard words, but they are
nevertheless truthful. And ift' any
man doubts it let him but peruse
that page (f Louisiana's History re
citing the short reign of the l)emo
cratic party from January 1,74, to
January 1 7T. l)uring that time
those who had taken especial pains
to go out of the way in their denun
ciation of all politicians; who yelled
from the house tops until they were
hoarse with their bawling that it was
a degredation and an insult to be
talked of as "a politician." ['hese
very men, we say, have been guilty
of tricks; have, in fact done nothing
else but "be guilty" of them, which
would put to blush the most debased
of barrel-house swashbucklers, and
to which no true politician would
dare descend.
Twelve short mouths have convinc
ed the people of this State that it is
not the man that howls loudest who
is the purest, and they are equally
convinced that none but those who
understand the science of govern
ment-i. e. true politicians-should
be intrusted with high office.
A government of politicians is a
government conducted on fixed prin
ciples-a government of "Conserva
tives" is one of daily disgrace and
toadyism.
Those Amnmedments.
The Legislature upon which so
much reliance has been place l by
those few persons who were deter
mined to thwart the will of a vast
majority of the citizens of the com
monwealth of Louisiana, has set, in
cubated and brought forth those
Amendments which were to have
been the panacea for all our ills. Sad
and bitter must be the disappoint
ment of thoso who relied upon this,
at all times and from the beginning,
broken reed for support, succor and
encouragement. For ourselves, we
have never for a moment entertained
the slightest hope that good could
come from the makeshifts proposed;
and these very reported amendments
are a trumpet-tongued vindication of
the PEOPLE'S VINDICATOR and its
course in criticising, however harsh
ly, those who had been chosen to
represent the Democratic party in
the Legislature and elsewhere, and
who had, up to the assembling of the
present session of the General As
sembly, utterly and signally failed,
as they have to this hour, in the work
required of them.
Ilad tile press of cour party gene
rally seconded our efforts, the result
might have been quite differert, but,
in that, as in all else, there seems to
be a studied effort to disjoint our ac
tion from more quarters than one,
and the individual efforts here and
there to put the party on a "war
footing," that victory to it might not
only be assured, but that substancial
results might flow therefrom, have
met with either chilling silence or
petty rebuke.
This is not the time for recrimina
tion, however; the party in this
State has reached an era in its exis
tence fatal alike to itself and the peo
ple whose only hope of stable gov
ernment rest with its success and
perpetuity. In this supreme hour,
when appalling disaster seems to be
surely overtaking us, nothing but the
wisest, best, most patriotic and vigor
onus men should be relied upon. Rank
stupidity-the grossest idiocy-has
brought us to this verge-men of op
posite capabilities must now be
heard.
Business Failures.
The New York Bulletin, in speak
ing of the suspension of J. L. Adams
& Co., of New York, and J. I. Adams
& Co., of New Orleans, says the New
Orleans house did a business of three
million dollars a year, having a capi
tal invested of about $500,000, and
managed by John I. Adams, who is a
cousin of Jay L. The latter partner
resides here and has an individual
interest in both concerns to the ex
tent of $400,000. Of late thle New
Orleans branch has not been profita
ble, and considerable of their paper
is now afloat, as the firm were short
of money, and had to have notes dis
counted. The business was started
there thirty years ago, and large ad
vances were made from time to time
to sugar planters. Many of the lat
ter became involved during the years
from 1870 to 1875, and this caused
some embarrassment to the firm, but
the New York house being financial
ly strong, was enabled to give suffi
cient help to pull them through, and
both concerns were then rated higher
than ever. For a long time past both
houses have enjoyed almost unlimited
credit, and the individual members of
both firms have been held in the
highest estimation.
John I. Adams & Co., have been
enabled to resume business, we are
happy to state, and their many friends
hereaboats will be glad to know that
this hitherto staunch house will go on
without interruption.

\e most heartily second the above
suggestion of the (Corier". We asked
the Chairean of th State CCenltial
Committee to call together that body
early in January, in order that they
might, as the party magnates ex
press to the Legislature the wishes of
the party. Our request drew from
that gentlemain a long effltosion enl)ing
with a call of the .Eneeeire Commit
tee of the State Ceeitral Committee
and they decided a. call of the State
Centrael Committee "ill opportunle."
Fatal word '
WV do not wish to charge these
gentlemen with design, but the whole
history of the defeat of thle Constitu
tional Convention, and the miserable
failure of the legislature to enact
wholesome and p eformatory laws,
has the appearance of a vast conspi
racy.
The oplponlents of the people have
eustained at unsbroken, sullen sic
lence-lthey have voted stubbornly
against every wish, desiand and
right of their enestituents, and ite i
required that Tilt IFmo)('RATI( PARnTY
should repudiate their actiopa, eofphat
itally and at once.
Let us have a State Convention folr
consultation immediately.
