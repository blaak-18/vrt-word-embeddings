PUBLIC SCHOOLS—AND HYGIENE
Municipalities are beginning to
realize the fact that, beginning with
the school children, in the matter of
hygienic instruction, is about the
best plan for the spread of whole
some rules of living.
A canvass, made by physicians in
several cities, brought out the fact
that half the children in attendance
at the public schools were badly in
need of medical attention, and, to
put it plainly, bathing.
This isn’t a condition of affairs pe
culiar to any city in the United
States; it takes in all, and the per
centage is about the same, North,
South, East and West.
Out of 628 children examined in
one school, fifty-three per cent, were
found to be defective. According to
a table prepared by the doctor, the
defects were listed as follows:
Nutrition 1
Anemia 13
Parasites 38
Dandruff 6
Eyes 101
Glands 11
Teeth 142
Tonsils 57
Adenoids 88
Skin 9
Cardiac disease 13
Lungs 3
Bone 2
Ears 1
Number Temporarily Dismissed.
For parasites 38
For itch 1
Total dismissed 39
There is scarcely a State in the
Union which has not devised and
contributed to a most elaborate sys
tem of public school education.
Parents in districts where books
must be paid for by the pupil, testify
to the elaborate outfit needed to
equip the average child for its pub
lic school course.
Recently, in a large Southern city,
parents rebelled at the charges made
for “extras” for the drawing classes
in the public schools. The super
fluousness of all this high-class edu
cating is pitiably brought out in the
table reproduced. Children who
were studying algebra had not learn
ed enough of hygiene to keep their
teeth clean; the eyes, surely the
most important organs of the body,
neglected; other physical defects so
great as to make the percentage of
physically defective children half
the number of those attending
school.
The need of soap and water may
be noted in some of the specified
cases, and will be easily recognized.
The question is this: in our ef
forts to make our public schools
more like colleges, are we not ignor
ing a great deal which the children
attending may not otherwise ever
learn ?
Theoretical hygiene isn’t worth
the time it takes to open the book to
find the page, but the sound, practi
cal doctrine of the cleanliness that
is next to godliness, should be taught
by the schools in large cities.
If we are to have physically and
morally clean men and women, we
must begin to teach them the need
and the beauty of these two sorts of

NEW ABSORPTION METHOD
If you suffer from bleeding, Itching,

your address, and I will tell you how
to cure yourself at home by the new
absorption treatment; and will also
send some of this home treatment free
for trial, with references from your
own locality if requested. Immediate
relief and permanent cure assured.
Send no money, but tell others of this

cleanliness, and we can not begin
any too soon.
Heavy and intricate systems are
not needed; lectures occasionally
from d’octors, dentists and profes
sional nurses would be of more value
to our future men and women than
learning to braid pink paper baskets
or painting green roses on a pink
background. Art is beautiful —to
the artistic, but what Uncle Sam
needs is good, healthy, clean, moral
ly and physically, men and women.
And it’s up to our public schools to
lay the groundwork.

PLAIN TRUTH
A MONTHLY MAGAZINE, 32 PAGES
By J. A. SCARBORO,
A Sou of Georgia, Minister and
Student.
This Magazine is digging up and
exposing corruption and graft in
“Missions”. Its Editor has studied
the subject fifteen years, published
two books on the subject and knows
what he is doing. Dr. J. N. Hall,
late Editor of the Baptist Flag, the
most widely circulated Baptist pa
per in the South, with whom Scar
boro was associated as Editor of
that paper, said of him: “J. A. Scar
boro is the best informed man on
missions in America.” The cham
pions of the present system have
declined to meet him in both press
and on rostrum. His Magazine is
full of facts, evidence and argu
ments which can not be refuted. He
is Treasurer of the General Asso
ciation of Baptist Churches, and has
the confidence and enjoys the en
dorsement of his brethren. He is
Pastor of one of the best churches
in the land and just in his prime
and in thb thickest of the battle for
truth and righteousness.
