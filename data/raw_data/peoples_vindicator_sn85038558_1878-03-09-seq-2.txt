MORE MONEY. us
The Silver Bill having become a to
law, our people neJed not instantly h.
look for bright results. The perni- fi
cious contraction policy of the past te
twelve years will be felt for a long si
time to come, and the evils brought hb
about by the vicious legislation in
favor of the bond-holder and money- a
lender, will not be eradicated in a
day or a year. tl
The Bill as passed restricts the
coinage of Silver to $4,00,o00) per h
month, and deprives that metal of
other priviledges now enjoyed by °
Gold. For those reasons we con
sider the measure as one of compiTo
mise, and its result will be a failure. t
It seems to us that the eurrency t
question is quite sirple, or rather our
ideas of itre quite at variance with C
--'eat number of learned, vo,lmni
ous and statistical gentlemen. We
admit we belong to the fiat money
school, but we are not as radical and
exclusive as some. In our ojnlion
gold and silver coins are stn,,arllds of~
value, selected by the common con
sent of civilized mankind because of
their very slight fluctuation; but as
a currency, per se, a circulating me- 1
dium between man and man, for the
uses of trade and commerce, they
are, beyond a moderate quntity of
fractional denominations for small
change, perfectly useless, and the 1
quantity required is totally delicient.
Our learned doctors seem to argue
from the basis that we want gold and
silver as a currency. For our part,
we want no such thing; at least in
whole. We want the government to
issue paper money; Treasury 11 otes,
not because of the intrinsic value of
the material composing them, because,
it possesses none, but because its
value will be extrinsic and derived
from the useful functions with which
our Government vests them.
This is, we are well aware, de
nounced as the Greenback heresy
by many, but if it be a heresy it is
one the United States indulges in to
an extent few unthinking men real
ize. What is the National Bank is
sue, but an issuance of this paper
money which we demand These
National Bank Nones are issued up
on Bonds deposited as security with
the Government for their redemption n
-and these Bonds are redeemable in 1
coin l says the bhard money man.
Well, the money the Government is t
to issue for our wants and to supply s
the demands of our growing trade f
and population, is based on the same
coin which is to redeem the interme
diate security between your National E
Bank Note and the Government.
We propose, in other words, to take
the Child of our Government as our
circulating medium, while the gold
men insist the Grand Child is better.
Then they tell us that there is not
gold and silver coin enough to re
deem the issue we greenback men
would desire-that the wants of
trade would demand. Such an ar
gument is fatal to itself. If cornm
merce and the wants of the people
did not require paper money there
would be no need to issue it, and if
tool enough to suppose they would
want it redeemed.
We want United States Treasury
Notes as a currency, because trade
and the wants of the citizen require
more money; something to circulate
not to be redeemed and invested in
gold and silver. That is for old men,
women and misers. The live, vigor
ous citizen wants money for trade
and barter, and lie wants plenty of
it.
Ben Butler's name we know Is not
very popular with Louisianains, but
his speech on finance delivered in
Congress on 27th of February, has the
ring that suits us. This point we
quote, as it embraces our views exact
ly.
"'I see nothing, therefore, uncon
sistant in saying to this House that I
do not consider the use of silver as a
currency by any means the best cur
rency for that use. I have said that
I think it senseless, expensive, fool
lab, to lock up valuable merchandise
to do duty as a currency when experi
ence has told all men who have ever
need a banker's check, a bill of credit,
a bill of exchange, a promissory note,
or a greenback, that an inexpensive
article may be made a measure of
value, and that to make it the meas
ure of value in the article of which the
measure itself is composed, but that
Its value can fully be determined by
what is within or stamped upon it,
and not by its merchandise value."
In other words coin, and especial
ly silver, is more valuable as a metal
than we can make it as a currency
and when coined it will flow abroad
to be melted up; thus returned to its
merchantable shape and lost to us a
earrency. He proposes and we advo
cate the stamping, for use as a cur
rency-as a measure of value, of an
article like paper which is inexpen
slve and has no merchantable value,
approaching its stamped value, as a
crrency.
The river at this point, falling very
utowly.
Inherent Rights and Statute Law.

The fact of this was hrought force- F'
ably to our mind in the late contest ht
Sagainst the n1onopolics existing in (t

to Their very existance is contrary to
s, one of the dearest of the declarations
of contained in the freeman's bill of
1so rights-that no man shall have rights
its which are not possessed by the citi
ed zens generally.
ich Admitting for sake of argument
that the Legislature did grant exclu
Ic- sive privileges to Mr. Hloward and
Csy his lottery company, where do you
tis tind authority for them to do so in
to the Constitntion. The Legislature is
hal- the'e restricted to certain well deftiled
is- duties and is prohibited from exer
per cising others-One of which, by the
ese bill of rights, is, that no man shall
Ip- have rights which are not possessed
iti by the citizens generally. This would
ion at once conclude the argument of our
in legal friends, for the Legislature not

Public Men-Public Morals. to
We want no better evidence of the
depravity of our public morals-the °
demoralization of our public men
the degredation of our public press
than the "vote of confidence" to d
Speaker Bush, in the shape of eiht T
lollars per day extra pay, by the a'
Louisiana Legislature the other day. re
f Heretofore, in ye olden time, when el
men were giants in intellect and vir- i
tue, a vote of confidence was a vote "
of thanks, which, emnanatin from
pure and honorable men, was esteem- *
ed beyond all worth, was valued be. t!
yond dollars. In those days "eight A
dollars a day" offered as a token of d
esteem, of confidence, would have
been rejected with scorn as an insult
to the honor of the presiding officer.
To-day, how changed! Insidious j
f Radicalism has sapped the foundations r
of our public morals-we measure a
virtue by dollars, and the degrading t
t spectacle is presented of a Demo- 1
cratic Legislature voting eight dol- c
lars a day extra pay as a token of 1
e esteem and confidence, and the pre
e siding officer accepting the "esteem"
but declining the money. Accepting
it too, "with feelings of heart-felt
pride, &c," when 1,o should have re
I jected both the money and the man
a ner with scorn and indignant utter- 4
ance as an insult to his personal honor
and the position he occupied. And the
e press of New Orleans was full of
warm congratulations to Speaker
tr Bush and the legislature for this
t, honorable interchange of courtesies!

t Too Late.
, It is amusing to see the Press of t
our State, that has been hitherto si
lent or full of applause for the Leg
d islature, now in a perfect fury over
the result. It was all rose andl sun
li shine two m1onths since, and we fel
lows who dared question the ponder
ous wisdom of the piddlers just ad
journed, were denounced as violent,
clamorous, howling outs, who wanted
to get in.
This failure, gentlemen, is all your
own-you have failed, and that sig
e nally, but you must bear it with, we
hope, that stoicism with which you
o disregarded the appealsof the people.
t The Democratic party repudiates you
as unworthy sonS, and you must
retire to that seclusion which, howev
en r deep it may be, and we sincerely
r- hope it may be deep, your conduct
to merits you.
Thus passes away, in a blaze of
Ssquibs, the legislature which "con
Se- tained all the brains in the State."
lt We are only sorry Bob Ingersoll has
of discovered there's no hell.
"It is Finished." ti
The General Assembly of this State
just adjourned will take rank as the q
most stupid--the most-expected-from- l
and-the-least-done body of men
that ever assembled in Louisiana.
We have had worse legislatures be
cause they were corrupt and venal,
f but we have never yet had one so u
supremely idiotic as the one just I
adjourned.
They were proof -against appeals, 0
t and, in their stern silent majesty
Smoved on to an ignoble end, cateless
of the future, and perfectly indiffer
- ent to their fates.
The Last Fire Company.
f During the early Winter our city was
r visited by several disastrous fires, and
s for a month or so alarms were ahnlost 1
incessant. Our young men, ever patriot
ic, responded to the public demand and
organized a Fire Department. They
had every assurance of assistance and
support from the city authorities and
property owners. Last Wednesday even
ing the "Department" met and dissolved
a for want of support from either the pro
't perty owners or the city, or both.
d Comment is hardly necessary; but we
a would remark, that the property owner
a. is the only persons interested in main
, taining a Fire Company-his buildings
are to be protected, and he should be
Swilling to pay for it. It seems that dead
apathy has taken hold of nearly every
man in this town, and the whole place is
to all appearance playing Macanber
"waiting for something to turn up." We
to sincerely hope it won't he a big tire.

Peace in Europe,
The latest news from Europe brings
us the gratifying intelligence of the
signing of a treaty of peace between
Russia and Tnukey. Turkey loses
all or nearly all her European pos
sessions, including Servia, Bosnia,
Croatia, HIerzegovania, Ronmania and
Bulgaria. These are set up .by Rus
sia an indepen:lent principalities, and
are of course in hlr interests. In
Asia, Russia takes Kars and Batouni
and 12 millions pounds war indem
nity. Turkey is thus destroyed as a
power of any importance.
Louisiana Pap in Washington.
The following is about the situa

The fight for the collectorship is
assuming very vigorous proportions.
Wells sent a dispatch to the presi
dent and Sherman energetically pro.
e testing against Paclkard's appoint
SIment, and in regard to Steele, Wells
remarks: "This appointment would
be a public calamity."
The only persons really in ihe
e race are l'ackamtl and McMillan. It
al may be that some Democrat may
'y get in after all. Frank hatch or Tom
s Bynum will be named if this he done.
Kellogg says he is not Ippiosed to
Packard, but if he can't get the place,
why then he has his prefereuces for
the place.
lie says lie will stick to Plackard as
long as there is any chance for him.
s* Nobody has been agreed on for post
master. Badger, it is thought, has
the inside chance, as has A. H1. Leon
rad for the district attorneyship.
