The Dinners of a Vegetarian in
the Summer Time.
We do not advocate the vegetarian
system of diet, but in order to letpJur
readers see how one of the leaders in
this refom (f) Prof. Francis Newman,
lived for a given length of time we
reprint the following from the pen of
that gentleman, from ia recent nunm
her of the London Dietetic Reformer.
The writer says in introducing the
subject: "The question has so often
been put to me, 'But actually, what
do: you get for dinner f' that I at
length resolved to keep a register of
my dinners for an entire month. At
first I intended to give every day lit
erally, but on finding that from net
having vegetarian mesemates to fin
ish my dishes I often had nearly the
same dinner for two days together,
ur the principal dish three days. I
thought this accurate" publication of
my economy to be a needless bit of
autobiography. I have therefore
generally omitted such repetition. If
any one new to vegetarianism should
read through the list of these nine
teen dinners eaten by me in June, I
fqar he will rather think me a luxuri
ous epicure than pity me as an asce
tic." Following is a list of the din
ners as recorded by Prof. Newman:
1. Peas pudding from split peas,
with onion sauce, in which is sage and
parceley. Boiled cabbage. Stewed
gooseberries and rhubarb. Curd and
whey.
2. Savory pie, of vegetables, with
topioca. Broth from yesterday's peas
(better than any mutton broth), with
slice of brown bread' and butter.
Baked pudding of rice, sago and'Sul

3. An omlet, with savory herbs.

How Col. Bangs was Paid.
It is a notorious fact that itinerant I
circus companies pay very poorly and i
that the man who does not get his
money from then in advance is not t
likely to get it at all. Col. Bangs of i
the Argus has suffered a good deal i
from these concerns, and when "The
Great European Circus and. Metropo
litan .Caravan" tried to slip off the
other day without settling its adver- 4
tising bill, he called upon the sheriff ,
and got him to attach the Rocky Moun- 1
tain bear for the debt. The bear was 4
brought in its cage .and placed in the a
. composing room, where it consumed i
n fifteen dollar's worth of meat in two i
days (the Colonel's bill was only i
twelve dollars) and scratched one
n trousers.-leg off of the reporter who
ar was standing in front of the cage, I
in giving the foreman a lecture in zoolo
., gy. On the third day the bottom fell
,e out of the cage, and as the Rocky I
)f Mountain bear seemed to want to I
r roam around and inquire into things, I
r. the whole force of conapositors all at I
oe once felt as if they ought to go sud- i
n denly down stairs and give the ani- 4
at mal a chance. With that mysterious a
it instinct which distinguishes dumb
if animals and which goes far to prove
Lt that they have souls, the bcar went I
t- at once for the door of Batrgs's sane
*t tup and broke in just as the Colonel
- was in the middle of a tearing edito
o rjal ou ,n "The Thilrd Ter and our
r tendefncies towards Coesar m." The
I Colonel, 'howeter, did not hesitate
f to knock off. He stopped at once
if and emerged with a fine, airy grace
e through the window, bringing the
If sash with him, and then he climed up
d the water spout to the roof, where lihe
* sat until ahotk and ladder company
I came and took him off.. The Argue
i- did not issue for a week, for although
!- the Colonel bombarded that bear with
.- shot guns pointed through the-win
dows, and although the fire engine
s, squirted hot water at him, be got
d along very comfortably until Satur
d day night, when he tried to swallow
d a composing stick and chocked to
death: When they entered the room
b they found that the animal had upset r
is all the type and had soaked himself
h in ink and then rolled over' nearly I
r. ev.ery square inch If thie, floor, while
I- the .Colonel's leader on' the ~Third i
4 Term was saturated with water and I
perforated with shot hbles. After
I. this, circus advertisements in the At
gus will be paid in advance.-Dan

Up a Tree.
From France, that land of romance,
core a new and pathetic story. A
Young man, in the blooml of health
and vigor, was engaged to be mar
ried to a beauteous maid. This in
genuous youth had one eye fixed on
the main chance, and arranged with
his future father-in-law that on the
day of his marriage certain real es
tate should be transferred to him.
The memorable morning arrived ; the
air was laden with' the perfame of
flowers, the birds sang, and the vil
lagers held a festival similar to those
seen in Italian operas. The bridal
party reached the chapel, which lay
ensconced among traditionary chins.
Thrusogh its churchyaid nlancldered
a streamlet whose survey ripples gliit
ened in the morning sun. Punctual
to the time, the;ctre arrived anmd tool,
a preliminary pinch of s5u1|t' as lie
surveyed the people before him.
Everybody settled into his or her al
lotted place. The ceremony was
about to be commenced, when it suld.
denly struck the bride that the bride
groom was non est. Clasping her
hand to her heart, with a pierc
ing. shriek she fell senseless. Clear
as a bell above the clamuor that
ensued, was heard the voice of the
father calling upon his friends to go
in search of the missing one. High
and low they hunmtet, .but the, game
could not be found. At last they dis
covered. the object of their search
comfortably ensconced among the
spreading brances of a lofty oak. On
being, requested to descend, hie in
quired "if they saw anything green
about him," to those below, who, hav
ing their eyes on his surroundings,
replied "plenty." In the midst of an
interchange of violent epithets he
gave a characteristic remark some
what to the effect that "he be blamed
if he would till that there real estate
was transferred." While the bride
was thus bowed down in anguish, and
the bridegroom was boughed up in
the tree, the father-in-law tore his
hair, and amid sobs and tears urged
the unreasonable nature of the re
quest, but to no effect. Finally the
document was brought forth, duly
signed and the recalcitrant bride
groom slid down the tree; After the
necessary repairs had been made in
his pantaloons,. with his reutes seour
ed and his rents sewn up, the bride
groom adjourned with the rest of the
party to tlhe cha 1l. The' bride re

WET BooTs.--What an amount of
discomfort wet boots entail, to be
sure; and how well we all, recall the

made to draw on a pair of hard-bak.
ed ones which were put by the fire
over night to dry. Damp and adhe
sive within, they are without stiff
and unyielding as born. The follow'
ing simple devite will rob the cold,
wet bain-yard of a slushy winter of
half itt promise ,of discomfort for the
next morning: When the boots are
taken pff fill them quite full with dry
oats. This grain lias a great fond'
ness for damp and will rapidly absorb
the last vestageJ of it from the wet
leather. As it takes; up tihe rpois
ture it swells and fills the boot with
a tiglhtly-fitting last, keeping Its form
gIodiahd drying the leather without
hardening it. In the morning shake
out the oats and hang them in a bag
near thie fire to dry, ready for the
iiext night, draw on the boots and
go happdily abont'the day's work.

Farm and Household Column.
To KEEP EGos OVER WINTER.
The Farmer's Advocate, Loudon, On
tario, recently offered a prize for the
best method of keeping eggs over
winter. The first recipe below took
the prize. What ever eaeldes th.
air prevents the decay of the egg;
What I have found to be the most
successful method of doing so is to
place a small quantity of salt butter
in the palm of the left hand and turn
the egg round in it, so that every
pore lof the shell is closed; then dry
a suflicient quantity of bran in ai
oven (be sure you have the bran
well dried, or it will rust.) Then
pack themr with the small ends down,
a lJiyer of bran and anitoter of eggs,
until your box is fall ; then place in a
cool, dry place. If done when new
laid, they will retain the sweet *nmilk
and card of a new laid egg for at
least eight or ten months. Any oil
will do, but salt butter never becomes
rancid, and a very small quantity of
butter will do a very large quantity
of eggs. To insure .freshness I rub
them when gatheied in frointhe nests,
then pack when there is a sufticient
quantity.--E. Alexander:
Mrs. Wm. Church says the best
way she finds is to "take a, pot or
pail, or any thing convenient, pult
about an inch or two of meal or any
kind of brand (I generally take khorts
from flour--being a farmer's wife, I
have it on hand) in it, put.a layer, of
eggs, either end ddwin,6ilose together;
then cover with meal,ý nother laaer
of eggs, and so on.. Intil the box is
full; occasionally giving it a ;hake to
fill well between the eggs r This plan
I have adpipted for yea'4 wlth sieaess,
and the last when usedL*bdeh is of
ten the' end of April. and bbgiuning of
May--are as good.as thefrst. I cop
meuce to pack in .September. The
whole secret lies in carefully selecting
fresh eggs, packing on ends and keep.
ing the air from them. 'Keep in a
dry, cool Iplace.
J. B. Strathuairn tUs:, "I takp a
tub of.any size nod put a layer of
common salt ibout an inch dlfep in
the. bottom. Then gresee .ho eggs
with butter, and places them in the
salt with the snallend. down, so that
they will not touch the, wood of the
tub nor each ,other; then 1tll thq va
cancies withi salt,' and cover theni
again about at hich deep, as before ;
then place another- layer 'of eggs as
before; then salt, alte nately,ltill the
tub i .fill: then covreri the tg ith
salt, and pmt them where the' will
lot freea. I have kept'8ggemow this
manner from September tall April, as
good as fresh eggs. The grease.on
the shell keeps tile sBlt from penetia
ting, thereby keeping the, eggs fresh,
while the saving qualities of the salt
keep them ' from becomlht' putrid.
This recipe is both ' healed and'good,
as the salt can be fod!to cattle after.
ward." .
