months, and then at the rate of four
million dollars per month. In Feb
ruary, 1868, Congress suspended the
Act of 1866. By that time, 44 million
dollars of the greenbacks had already
been, burned up. When the panic of
1873 came on, there was a popular
demand for more money, and the gov
ernment issued 26 million dollars of
greenbacks to take the place of those
that had been destroyed. This new
'\ssue of treasury notes brought up
the amount of outstanding green
backs, and other treasury notes, to
382 million. In 1875, Congress pro
vided that the amount of these notes
be reduced to 300 million. Then the
process of burning up the paper
money began again, but in 1878
President Grant put a stop to it. Con
gress, in May of that year, required
that all notes redeemed at the treas
ury be reinstated and put in circula
tion. The amount which was then
left outstanding was 346,681,000
dollars. But Congress has never re
pealed the Acts of 1862-3, which were
mandatory and which required that
450 millions of Treasury notes be is
sued; therefore, the government
could, at any moment, issue in green
backs the difference between the
amount now outstanding and that
which was authorized by the Acts of
1862-3. This amount, as you will
readily see, is more than 100 million
dollars.
“99 AND 3-3 RIGHT.”
Dear Mr. Watson: —I want to take
up just a little of your time in read
ing my sincere thanks to you for the
information furnished the general
public and the way you have handled
the question in your weekly and
monthly Jeffersonian in regard to
Foreign Missions. lam so glad you
have brought to light the real facts
of the Mission work in Foreign fields.
Not once have I doubted your state
ments on this subject, but you invite
your readers to search “The Book”
for themselves, and pointed out the
places in which they may read and be
wise. It put me to thinking so I did
so, and I find you are 99 and 3-3 right
as I see it. It is a very important
question, and should appeal to every
one who is old enough to know right
from wrong.
Hoping to learn more of the sub
ject in the future, I am,
Yours very truly,
Vidalia, Ga. J. A. HUNT.
THE PARSON AND PRESIDENT
CLEVELAND.
Dear Mr. Watson: —Will you
please answer through the columns
of your weekly Jeffersonian in regard
to Mr. Cleveland on the free silver
bill? We had a sermon from our
parson, Rev. Mcßreyer, and in the
run of his discourse he said that Mr.
Cleveland saved this country from
bankruptcy by killing the silver bill.
The parson stated the gold was worth
$1.35 in China and silver only 60
cents. Mr. Watson, I would like to
have some light on the subject.
Yours truly,
W. M GRIFFIN.
Rome, Ga.
Answer: What Mr. Cleveland did
was to call Congress into extra ses
sion to repeal the law under which
the Government purchased 4,000,000
ounces of silver per month and coin
ed it into silver.
This was not as good a law as the
country needed, for it failed to recog
nize silver as amoney of the Consti
tution. But it gave us a regular ad
dition to the circulating medium, to
meet the increasing demands of popu
lation and commerce.
The National Democratic party de
nounced this Sherman law “as a mis
erable makeshift,” because it requir
ed the Government to purchase a cer
tain limited quantity of silver each
month for coinage purposes, instead
or recognizing it at the mint on the
same terms as gold,—which the Gov
ernment had always done before
1873.
The people elected Cleveland and
a Democratic Congress, in the expec
tation of having the mint opened to
silver on the same terms that they
open to gold. That is what was
meant by the free and unlimited
coinage of silver, which the Demo
cratic leaders used to rave about.
Instead of opening the mints to
silver, Cleveland went to work to
stop the purchase of silver by the
Government and to stop the coinage
entirely.
To force Congress to do this, the
gold-bug bankers precipitated the
panic of 1873.
The parson got his facts reversed.
Cleveland did not save the country
from bankruptcy. On the contrary,
his policies came mighty near wreck
ing the republic.
WANTS MORE BIOGRAPHY.
Dear Sir: —I get a great deal of
pleasure from reading your publica
tions. I find myself differing from
your views occasionally, but your ad
vocacy and eternal fight made in be
half of the downtrodden, poor white
people of America meets my warm
est approval.
The best part of your journals to
me is your incidents about great
men of Georgia and the South. Give
us more.
Truly,
Saluda, S. C. C. J. RAMAGE.
P. S.: In reading opinion in Federal
Reporter reversing Jones, J., in
Alabama rate matter, I recognized
the views you have been advancing
on this point for several years.
GOOD LETTER ON MISSIONS.
My Dear Mr. Watson: —You are
shedding more light on important
subjects connected with the interests
of our country than any other man in
America. Hundreds of thousands of
good people are profoundly interest
ed in your articles on Foreign Mis
sions.
While you approve of preaching to
those Chinese heathen, we have not
a particle of faith in all the preach
ing that the world could do for those
heathen. They are the product of a
mingled people produced by amalga
mation in remote ages.
All newspaper readers are fa
miliar with the dreadful scenes en
acted there during the Boxer upris
ing. According to newspaper re
ports many American missionary
women were driven or led through
the country in a nude state, while
those idolatrous beasts would gratify
their beastly lust at will. Great God!
how can a Caucasian, an American,
Jeffersonian
lady with the picture of such out
rageous deeds in view think of pack
ing her suit case and tramping six
teen thousand miles to try to con
vert the unconvertible. They might
as well try to butt down the Chinese
wall. Let us all read what good old
truthful St. Paul says in Colossians,
Ist chapter, 5, 66 and 23rd verses.
Now, in Paul’s day the Gospel had
not been preached to the Chinese.
We are heartily in favor of aiding
the poor who belong to the Adamic
family-—those who are like old Noah
—perfect in their generation.
Yours truly,
Hatchers, Ga. E. N. KING.
NOTICE TO THE SOUTHERN
PEOPLE.
We, the nucleus of Southern peo
ple’s organization, state that if we
are not deceived, the true and pure
Southern people are ripe for organi
zation. The object of which is self
protection, Caucasian preservation,
etc. With the light before us as a
nation, we ask you to analyze the sub
ject and at least one from each coun
ty in every Southern State and Ter
ritory, an old Confederate soldier or
son, to answer us with their most
matured thought, and upon the spirit
of a majority of these letters we shall
act by proclaiming a call to the
Southern people to organize.
We await your answer.

ABOUT LIBERIA.
Dear Sir: —I don’t care how many
lions and tigers and elephants Teddy
kills, but I would like to know what
become of that Commission that
went to Liberia to look after the
starving niggers of that country, and
I think you are the only editor in the
United States that can tell us about
it just as it is. Will you do it?
MARTIN NEWLIN.
West York, Illinois.
Answer: The last we heard of the
Liberian Commission they were be
ing joyously welcomed and being car
ried around to see things. By this
time, they are probably on their way
back. The Jeffersonian will keep you
posted as to their report and recom
mendations.
A SOFT BERTH AND RAIMENT
FOR SOME REVERENDS.
Dear Mr. Watson: —When Rev.
Arcihald insinuates that you are a
thief at heart and that all that is
necessary to prove his assertion is a
good whack at the Foreign Mission
ary Funds, he certainly manifests un
mitigated gall and impudence. I im
agine he is one of those Rev. gents
of cloth who likes an easy job and a
soft berth, accompanied with “soft
raiment” and “broad phylacteries,”
of whom there are too many in cur
pulpits and that is why Zion lan
guishes, the poor don’t have the Gos
pel preached to them, and last, but
not least, the Catholics are taking
our country. Rest assured that lam
with you on the mission question, and
say continue to throw on the light
and give the facts to the people re
gardless of whom it hurts.
Yours, etc.,
JNO. P. AUSTIN.

“By George, I never saw anything
like the effects of that new treatment,
Protone, for the building up of weight
and lost nerve force. It acted more
like a miracle than a medicine,” said
a well known gentleman yesterday in
speaking of the revolution that had
taken place in his condition. “I be
gan to think that there was nothing
on earth that could make me fat. I
tried tonics, digestives, heavy eating,
diets, milk, beer and almost everything
else you could think of, but without
result. I had been thin for years, and

began to think it was natural for me
to be that way. Finally I read about
the remarkable processes brought
about by the use of Protone, so 1 de
cided to try it myself. Well, when I
look at myself in the mirror now, I
think it is somebody else. I have put
on just 30 pounds during the last
month and never felt stronger or more
‘nervy’ in my life.”
Protone is a powerful inducer of nu
trition, increases cell-growth, makes
perfect the assimilation of food, in
creases the number of blood-corpus
cles, and as a necessary result builds
up muscles and solid, healthy flesh, and
rounds out the figure.
For women who can never appear
stylish in anything they wear because
of their thinness, this remarkable
treatment may prove a revelation. It
is a beauty maker as well as a form
builder and nerve strengthener.
It will cost you nothing to prove the
remarkable effects of this treatment.
It is absolutely non-injurious to the
most delicate system. The Protone
