Go, tell it to the country round ;
Go, breathe it in the ajir ;
And let the sad sepulchral sound
Die in a whispered prayer,
Throughout the land-throughout the

.Bid each fanatic see
The white wan into bondage hurled,
R The colored man set free !
Cease, Charity, thy Christian deed;
Love, leave thy happy home :
And hearts that joy, and hearts that

Unto the burial come.
From every State, from all the wor!d,
To Freeom a grave we flee,
The white man's into bondage hurled,
The colored man set free !
A star is stricken from the sky,
And falls in wavering light;
A sister States's despairing cry,
Rings out into the night.
Let Freedom's banner now be faried,
Proclaim the sad decree :
The white man's into bondage hurled,
The colored man set free!
Bright bayonets glisten in the sun,
And merrily rank and file
Follow the tap of the sti:ring drum,
Withi insolent, haughty smile.
What does the dapper eaptain say t
"Orders from Washington ceady made
Washington, hundreds of miles away,
And Sheridpa not afraid !"
"Halt !" a voice from a sister Staide;
"Halt !" another, "Halt !" again;
"'Captain, open the city's gate,
We have heard her cry of pain:
Open the gate to all tbh world,
That every main mayo mo
The white.nawn into bondage hurled

. Address of the Demooratic Mem
bers of the South and
Southwest.
Waqhington, Fleb. 18.-The follow
ing address has just beesn prepared by
the Democratic members of the South
and Souethwest:
To the People,of the Southern States:
t You have' confided to the under
signed in this conjuncture of affairs
the delicate and' difficult task of
guarding in the Federal Congress
, your public interest, your rights and
your reputation. You will therefore,
n. pardon the liberty we take of ad
dressing yoft it'a period so critical,
upon a mhtter affecting your destiny
and that of your posterity. You can
not have Jed to observe the persia
Ethe a- inintrty torivie the ln
h imosities of the late war, which hap
pily, are fast giving place to a spirit
of concord and unity in every sec
tion of our common country. It is
impossible to predict certainly the i
effect of these appeals to passion.
We believe that through the honest 1
representation of upright and con
scientious Federal officers and agents,
an independent and able public press,
and of many citizens, withoat regard
to party, the true condition of South
era States and the real sentiment of
the Southern people are being gradu
ally made known. t our fellow-citi
sons of the North.. We hope for their t
favorable decision when fully appriz
ed of all'the facts. The great end of
good government 'will be reached (
when the people of all sections forget r
that we have ever been enemies, and h
come together as in the early days of
the republic, emulating each other c
only in devotion to the best interests ti
of the whole country. With this ex- ti
ilted purpose in view, thqre is noth
ing inconsistent with the honor and d
manhood of a bravo people to resolve o
to stufer with heroic patience what- A
ever be their provocations anl wrongs,
looking through the fearful present S
to a hopeful future, :and repelling un
just 'epithets and gratuitous. insults A
with digifed moderation. Let every
white man iu every neighborhood in
the.whole South regard himself as a n
mcomnissioner of the peace, maintain- P
lng. the kindliest relations towards the -
black man,. rememberiig that the ret
possibility for the extreme poverty hI
to which.we have been reduced, and at
the .corrupt governmaents to which H
his vote has subjectdL us, rests not
so much ujipn him as upon the bad
men who with the aserance of Fed m
eral support have by appeals to his
worst passions anounh ,to, make him
our enemy while ie labor by all
honest means to convince him of the
truth that our interest and his are
identical, and that both muset be pre,.
served by good government,. an·d that
those who pstr up sttire between' us
are the enemies of bothli race. Let us t
at the same time seelhat he is. fully ca
:protected in his guaranteed: rights to ac
vote as lie pleases ii all elections. hi
Let us continue to deal with' him
honestly and fairly, abd let us con- de
tinse cordially, to invite: to our midst if
those of any political p~arty who either in
,seek $to know the truth or to find Ti
hoepnei ipon our soil. 'We do not ex
aggerate when we admonish of 'the wi
disheartning fact that every street c
disturbance, every homicide of what- ma
ever character, by whomsoever com- hi
mitted, by black or white, Repubohlican
or Democrati sueh.as Are incident to t

The story of te Prodigal Son, as
f told by one of the Brunswick 'tbhoys :"
"Yer see, fellers, a good way back
-a long tinme befo-re jograf, was dis
h covered-tlhere lived an old lrmrner
I by thhi name of Prodigal, and he had a
I two sons. He was pretty solid-t-the
- old man was-had several quarter see
tions of land, and cattle aand. sheep
:and 1I;s, until you coullldn't rest.
'There warn't no polities in them days, ti
and sn old Prodigal didn't get any "
fool notion in his head of running *
.for Governor, lie just tended.strict- f
ly to the agricu'tooial business, and ti
threw money down into the bart:il
hand over first. Well, his hoyv tl
come of age, and.one of 'ema tohl the I
man he'd take his sheer of the statmps
that would b a 'colinig to him when fl
the head of the ranch pegged nut. le
He'd take his Iight away, and go oiff !l
and Prospect on his own hook. Old ti
Prod. gave him half of all lie had, "'
and the Sniart Aleck- shot into the m
city the first lthing. Hle was green, ds
you know, and the cappers spotted h
him as soon as he landed. They got tt
him to buck .-agan muonte, and fa'tuo,
and bunko, and it warn't long before in
lie reached the bottom nickle. He
played it on the soilp-houses and free th
lunches for a while, but lie got bonne. in,
ed at last and sent to the rock pile te
for a vag. When lhe came out, the e
duthed sneak started home to git an
other stake. Old Prodigal took haim tk
in, and got up a barbecue, and put iup pii
for him generally. The other son- wi
the one which had stayed at home all on
the time-kicked agin this. It 'pear- a
ed to him that lie warn't gittin' a tei
square deal. And when the old man anI
took his I)ur:ham calf, that lie Was a ilo
thttenin' for the fair, and made veal set
of it for his brother, he got on his tie
ear and called old Prod's hand. Then tdh
old Prodigal laid it down like this- an,
'There is more joy over ninety-nine
sinners which return than over one I
who don't go off.' That's Scripture, at
but I think that galoot as come a thi
sneakin' back after he got broke, was see

A WOMAN FORT" YEARS A SOLDIER.
-A Paris correspondent says :
An office of tlhe first Empire. aged
seventy-eight, who has for forty-one
years been living on the modest pen
sion of 800 francs a year, was recent
ly compelled to enter the Hospital
Neckev. and was there discovered to
be a woman. Her name is Deo Sen
keisen, and the secret being out she
readily related 1ier history. Sihe was
,fourteen years old when her father,
Col. Von Senkeisen, died, and her
grandfather, who commandedui Ba.
varian corps in the French service,
frunil ome inexplicable caprice, cornm
pelted her to enter one of the regi
ments of his division. She served in
Germany and in Spain, and at Water
loo received two sonmewhat severe
wounds. In 1833 she became a nat
uralized Frenchman, and obtained a
retiring pension. She has congratu
latory letters from Marshals Berthier,
Angerean and Schet, and from Gen.
Dupont, testifying to her bravery and
good service.
A very hospitable lady, who does
not liveove'r fifty miles from Utica
gaVe a party for her friends among
the young misses and masters the,
other evening. Round dances were
proposed,, when the lady said: "I
cannot allow you to have any round
dances. If any of the Edys :wish to
hug the girls,'let them sit down upon
the totes, anid go right at it in earnest,
but--to round dances, mind you !"
Was't that seusille ?
All the difference I can see between
the late Artemus Ward and U. 8.
Grant is that while the former was
williag to sacrifice his own and wife's
relations and friends to save the
country, the latter is willing to sa
trifice the country, to savey his' own
and his wife's relations and friends.

e Afternoon Tea Cakes.-Dry before
s the fire a quart of fine flour and rob
into it a quarter of a pound of but

n eggs with two tablespoonfuls of yeast,,
pour the whole into the center of the
flour, and keep mixing it well with a
P pint of warm new milk. Beat it up
Swith the hand until it comes off with

Mending with Plaster.--fyoq :imve
a crack in the wall in the corner of
the room or anywhere else, do hot
send for the plasterer, but get five "ot^
ten cents' worth of dry. plaster of.
Paris; wet with cold water; then
take your finger and rub it into the
crevice till it is smoothl. Bad nail
holes in the wall can he done in the
samne way. Should the top of your
lamp become loose, take it off and
wasihn it with soap; wash the glass
also, then put the plaster around ths
glass; put thie brass top on again,
let it stand untl hardened, and it is
ready for use again. A lamp should
never be filled quite fall, as the kero-,
sene softes the plaster.--lural Hose.
Eggs by Weight.--The. legislature.
of Massachusett hlas lately passed a.
law making it necessary that a dozn
eggs weighl one and one-half ponndt
'This is a move in the right direetion,~
and we Ihope that, all of the other
States may speedily follow the good
example oet by Massachusetts. It is
annoying to the breeder of blooded'
and fine lewls to find, when he offers
for sale eggs nearly twice as large as
his neighlbors, that they bring 1o
more per dozen than do thie smaller
ones. Also, thie consumer is often
vexed to find that lie must pay the
same price to-day for a dozen eggs
weighing Ibut a pound that he yes-:
terday Ipaid for a dozen weigting a
pound andl a Ihalf. Besides, an egg
fomni a well-fed fowl is heavier aind
richer than an eigg 'from a common
fowl that is only bhalf4ed, so that
weight comparted to size is an indi
cation of iichness. Tlhus eggs of.
which eight will weigh a pound are
better and richler thanI thlose of com.r:
