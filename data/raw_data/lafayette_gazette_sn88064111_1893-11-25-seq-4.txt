Flirting Prevents Marriage.
It is through flirtation, which has
advanced to something like a fine art,
that many marrigeable young folks
lose their chance in life. Flirtation de
stroyes confidence between the persons
who indulge in it: it prevents the
natural growth of mutual esteem; it is
not a thing of good faith. It is an er
ror to suppose that lovemaking and
flirtation are identical; they are, in
truth, antithetical. Lovemaking is
tender and ennobling, while flirtation
is cruel, foolish and demeaning. The
one is to prelude the wedded happiness;
the other is inimical to it Young men
and women should exercise their
reason while on the lookout for suita
ble life partners; yet many of them
give encouragement to flirters, silly
flirters. who are taken up or thrown
off, with results that are often griev
onus, indeed.-People's Journal.
Econeoy in Dress.
A sensible woman, talking about
economy in dress, says that the wear
of clothes depends largely on the treat
ment we give them. Directly a stitch
gives away, mend it. at once, if possi
ble. See that all walking dresses are
made short enough to escape the
ground at the back; nothing looks
worse than a frayed out skirt or petti
coat Renew the braid whenever it
becomes worn; the coat is trifling, but
makes a skirt neat even when well.
worn. Neatness is the frst requisite
for good dressing. Even if you are
obliged to wear shabby gowns, they
are respectable so long as they are
kept in perfect repair, and their shah.
biness is much mitigated if the wearer
adds clean collar and cuffs.-N. Y.

An English admiral who was once
visiting a French flagship laid down his
quid on a convenient bulkhead before
entering the officers' headquarters.
When he came out again he was aston
ished to find the quid in the place
where he had left it.
"Pooh!" said he, in the hearing of
some of the sailors, "you Frenchmen
will never be true sea-dogs. No English
blue-jacket would ever have let an
admiral's quid alone."
WVhereupon one of the French sailors
stepped up, touched his cap and said:
"Beg pardon, admiral; I wvasehewing
your quid While you were in there, but
I put it back, you know, when I heard
you coming out!"
