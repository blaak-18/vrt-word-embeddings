SATURDAY, JULY 3s, 1897.
With high-tarifd-free-silver states
men, law-tarif-goldbug statesmeh,
two tickets in the field,in Kentucky
and Ohio, Grover writing letters at
Buzzard's Bay, Henry Watterson
writing anti-Cleveland editorials,
Tom Watson threatening that
leading Pops will break into the
Democratic party, Mark Hanna
distributing the dough among the
Buckeyes, Col. Breckinridge mat
ing speeches in Kentucky, Madeline
Pollard living in seclusion in Lon
don town, and an increase of the
beer tax, the party seems to be in a
bad row of stumps just now. It
would take a half dozen Andrew
Jacksons to straighten out things.
The tact that some people in
Calfax participated in a Sunday ex
cursion has caused the editor of
the Chronicle to make the assertion
that "a great many more so-called
respectable people of the world are
on the broad road to hell than are
trying to get to heaven." The
Chronicle man should not allow
this to worry him. It people who
go on Sunday excursions are to be
damned for it, our esteemed con
temporary will have an excruciat
ingly painful time to tread the nar
row pathway which leads to the
golden gates.
Jno. E. Bruce, an 'educated ne
gro of Albany, N. Y., recently vis
ited the Nashville Exposition and
other points in the South. After
Bruce returned to New York he
published a letter in which he says
there is no more prejudice in the
South toward the negro than.in the
North, and the friction which oc
curs from time to time in the South
ern States is nearly always caused
by the darkies themselves. Bruce
is evidently not in love with his own
race. He says that the lower
classes of negroes are "bumptious,
orerbearing, greasy, boisterous and
insulting."
The W. C. T. U. started out to
abolish the liquor habit, but it has
conducted several crusades against
other habits which it considered as
injurious as John Barleycorn.
Some time ago the society waged a
fierce war on the kinetoscope pic
tures which reproduced the Corpett
Fitzsimmons fight, but the good
women failed to convince the
American people that the kineto
scope was an evil. Now- they
have opened war on the corset.
the Daily States ventures the
prediction that as the corset has
been so close to the feminine heart
for centuries it will not go. The
States expresses the opinion that if
the fight is not called off the W. C.
T. U. will lose a great many of its
very excellent members because the
average woman would rather be
dead than to look flabby.
In speaking of the heroism of the
seventeen-year-old daughter of the
keeper of the Stratford lighthouse in
saving the lives of two young men
who had been fishing in i'e sound
and fell overboard while raising the
anchor, and of the devotion of
Mary Carter, aged sixteen to her
father, formerly teller -in the
National Bank of Commerce, of
New York, and in January, 3895,
sentenced to the penitentiary for six
years for embezzlement, having la
bored for two years for his release
and at length securing it from
President McKinley, the Baltimore
Sun pays this beautiful tribute to
the sex:
"*It is not necessary to read either
novels or ancient history to find
heroines. Nearly every man has
them in his own household, though
sometimes he is too blinded by his
own egotism and selfishness to rec
ognize them. It is comparatively
rarely that they figure in newspaper
reports, but they are constantlh
pulling some man or other out of
deep water or saving some relative
or friend from the consequences of
·his own sin or folly. Every now
-and then they show, too, thaikwhen
it comes to a pinch the hard that
rocks the cradle can also perform
deeds that require the highest degree
of courage and heroism, and that
the heart that quails in the presence
ofa mniouse can stand firm and un
4uat.d beose a hostile world."
enet Popd .-flitin t'l*jU
is *thAt
the third party is about to pass out
of existence. Mr. Watson volun
teers the additional information
that with the breaking up of that
party its members will return to the.
old parties of which they were
staunch adherents before they em
braced the principles of Populism.
If Mr. Watson knows what he is
talking about, thejcollapse of the
People's party will strengthen the
Democracy throughout the Union,
but more especially in the Southern
States. This is as it should be.
All conscientious Populists should
find shelter in the Democratic
household. The howling dema
gogues and blatant agitators who
have brought the People's party to
a perhaps premature grave will
doubtless cling to it as long ts there
is a semblance of it left, but the
rank and. file who are thoroughly
honest and sincere, though mis
taken, will not hesitate to resume
allegiance to the- only party which
holds out any hope to the oppressed
masses of the country. The Dem
ocratic party is" the only political
organization in the United States
pledged to restore to the people the
rights guaranteed to them by the
Constitution, but stolen from them
by an arrogant plutocracy through
its subservient tool, the Republican
party. Ninety per cent of the
Populists of Louisiana will sacrifice
no principle by coming back to the
Democratic party. By joining
forces with the Democrats they will
form an army that will be well nigh
invincible when battling against the
invidious assaults of the" money
power. The issue to-day is to
down the trusts. And to accom
plish that end the vote of every
honest man is needed. Without
the Democrats the Populists are
powerless. With the Populists the
Democrats are powerful and will
prevail over the combined influence
of the trusts and monopolies.
We are told that the leading trusts
and corporations have gotten to
gether and combined their interests
and have formed a monster trust of
trusts beside which the Standard
Oil Company is an extremely mild
concern. This gigantic trust, it is
said, will be composed of the
Standard Oil Company, the Ameri
can Cotton Oil Company, the
Leather Trust, the Tobacco Trust
and all the other blood-sucking
corporations at whose bidding the
American Congress has just in
flicted upon the masses a tariff law
pronounced by the conscientious
leaders of both parties as the most
iniquitous measure in the history of
American legislation.
Now that these powerftll enemies
of liberty and progress are banding
together like the bandits who prey
upon their fellows on the highways,
is it not time that all honest citizens
should make common cause and
make an earnest fight not only to
repel the encroachments upon their
liberties, but to wage on a relentless
war until the last trust has been
crushed to earth?
Some editors who evidently do
not believe in the "eternal fitness
of things" appear to be displeased
because Mark Hanna has moved
into the White House.
Gov. Foster, who has. just been
visiting in the country, told a New
Orleans rep6rter that the crops are
looking well. The reporter did noot
say if the governor was referring to
the crops of delegates to the con
stitutional convention.
Old People.
Old people who require medicine
to regulate the bowels and kidneys
will find the true remedy in Electric
Bitters. This medicine does not
stimulate and contains no whiskey
nor other intoxicant, but acts as a
tonic and alterative. It acts mildly
on the stomach an.l bowels, adding
strength and giving tone to the or
gans, thereby aiding Nature in the
performance of the W1unctions.
Electric Bitters is an excellent
appetizer and aids digestion. Oid
people find at just exactly what they
need. Price fifty cents and $, .oo

as, and who i. regarded as the
best authority on the tariff, bas
been asked to point out the worst
features of the Dsagle) bill, and is
quoted as follows: "In the new
tariff are so many outrages that it
is hard to tell-what its worst feat
urtes --re. Perhaps the woolen
schedule . may be considered the
worst. The heavy tax laid on raw
wool, with the compensating taxes
to the manufacturers, will make the
average rate of burden imposed in
the woolen schedule enormously
high. It will practically prohibit
the importation of all classes of
goods that are made in the United
States. The crockery and glass
schedules are equally obnoxious,
but the bill is filled with gifts to the
trusts and manufacturing monoplies.
As it came from the house it carried
the highest average of taxation ever
imposed. As reported to the
Senate from the committee it was
slightly modified and in his opening
speech Mr. Aldrich said that a bill
prosposing excessive burdens was
not to be thought of. In the con
sideration of the measure, however,
the Republicans systematically
abandoned the Senate amendments
and took the house rates, and in
many instances even raised the
rates obove those proposed by the
House."
We often hear of protection
Democrats, but we have yet to hear
of -a tariff-for-revenue-only-Repub
lican. Strange, is it not?
THE ELECTION CONTEST.
The Lafayette Municipal Case

Judge Miller Deems the Case
Important Enough for a
Full Bench.
The following was filed in the state
supreme court Saturday.
"*To the Honorable the Chief Justice and
