PEOPLE BECOMING AROUSED AGAINST

•mclose herewith my check for $2, for which
y<>u will please renew subscriptions as fol
lows: "Weekly Jeffersonian to’ M. G. Oakv.
Mille rsvillc, 111.; Magazine to A. Harris, Cor
sicana, lexas.
Taking your editorial in your last Weekly
■*s a text, my friend Oaky delivered this
morning the finest speech on the money ques
tion 1 ever heard. He began by quoting In
gersoll: “That if the people understood our
national banking system it wouldn’t endure
fifteen minutes.” His telling points were.
We want no money that requires a “redeem
er.” If this government is able to stand se
curity for the issue of banks, it is able to is
sue the money itself. The idea of a few men
comprising national banks —having it in their
power to regulate and operate the money of
fhi« country [ hate the gold standard “worse
THE JEFFERSONIAN.
than the devil hates holy water,” etc. Thus
the discussion goes merrily on, and I hope Mr.
Bryan will stand firm and declare for the
Democratic idea of money.
Yours truly,
BEN A. NEAL.

WANTS TO HEAR FROM NORTH CARO
LINA.
Huekabay, Tex., Dec. 8, 1907.
Dear Sir: You will please find enclosed
two dollars for renewal to your two publica
tions. Myself and wife like to read your
writings and admire your way of taking plu
tocrats to task. I think your editorial on the
fight in Mississippi was simply grand. I
hope you may live long to espouse the poor
farmer’s and laborer’s cause. I cannot vote
for either of the old party candidates. I
would like to hear from some of my old
North Carolina friends as they seem to be
vprv silent there. I left that grand old state
in the year of 1870 and was glad to read of
Governor Glenn’s victory over the railroads.
I am your friend,
A. D. PARSONS.
(Note: Yes, North Carolina is rather silent
these days. Busy about tobacco, you know.)

NOTHING.

I can’t do without them. Turn on the light
among the thieves as Havron is doing with
the Northern Presbyterian Church that tried
to steal the Cumberland Church property,
and all. I would like to know what you think
of that. Will write again. Send to Aber
deen, Miss, Route 4. A friend as ever,
