Hunareds of Telegrams Received by the
Family of the Late Editor.
Columbia. S. C., Jan. 21.-After four
days of suffering death came shortly
after noon Monday to Marcisso Gener
Gonzales, editor of the Columbia State,
who was shot last Thursday by Lieu
tenant Governor James H. Tillman. He
was unconscious when the end came.
His wife, his three brothers, his sister.
members of the editorial staff of the
State and the surgeons were present.
Surgeons attribute the death of Mr.
Gonzales as shown by the autopsy to
"profound septic inflammation from
gangrenous condition tissue, conse
quent upon bullet wounds."
Coroner Green empanelled a jury.
with Allen Jones, a prominent business
man, as foreman. Mose of the other
members are well known business men,
also. The jury viewed the body after
which the inquest was adjourned uLtil
Thursday at 8 p. m., when testimony
will be heard in the county court
room. The body was then taken to t'-e
residence of Mr. Gonzales, in Hender
son street. Attorney Coleman L.
Blease. who is said to be one of Col
onel Tillman's lawyers, was present
when the jury was at the hospital. but
took no active part in the proceedings.
Soon after the death of Mr. Gon
zales a telephone message carried the
news to Captain Sligh. the county
jailer, and he apprised Tillman. It is
stated that the latter received the
intelligence without any expression or
betokening any emotion one way or
the other. He was askel if he would
make a statement and replied through
his brother-in-law, Judge Buchanan.
that he had nothing to say.
When the news that the end had
come was bulletined to Charleston the
flags on the buildings of the News and
Courier and Charleston Post were at
once placed at half mast.
Throughout Monday morning hun
dreds of telegrams of sympathy have
poured in not only from dommunities,
newspapers and citizens from all over
South- Carolina, but from many Ameri
can cities, north and south. Among
them were expressions from Hugh S
Thompson of New Ycork, ex-governor
of South Carolina, and Gonzalo de
Quesada, the Cuban minister at Wash
ingtoan

PORTLAND THE PLACE.
Oregen City Holds Next National Live
stock Associatl'on.
Kansas City. Mo., Jan. 17.-The
sixth annual convention of the Nation
al Livestock association adjourned Fri
day to meet next year at Portla.dl.
Ore. Before adjournment all the oi
cers were re-elected and the icitiatinve
was taken in a systematc lIcgi.:a:ive
campaign against the proposed pack
ing house merger. Hlon. im. MI.
Springer, general counsel of the asso
ciation, in , spirited address, outlined
a bill which he had formulated. "to
protect trade and commerce against
unlawful restraints and monopolies,"
and which he said was merely an adap
tation of the Sherman anti-trust law
and the Hoar bill now pending in the
senate. President Springer said that
if the proposed merger was ever con
summated the National Livestock as
sociation would string packing houses
from Chicago to San Francisco. In
response to an appeal from the execu
tive committee for a legislative wo, k
ing fund, $7500 was subscribed in less
than thirty minutes.
The following resolutions, recom
mended favorably by the executive
committee were taken up for consider
ation: Indorsing the omnibus state- I
hood bill. Endorsing the policy of the
agricultural department in its efforts
to eradicate poisonous plants on the
ranges. Endorsing the Tongue pure
food bill, asking congress to immedi
ately pass the census bill. Asking the
agricultural department to repeal the
forest exclusion order and protesting
against the government setting aside
vast tracts of land for game preserves.
Transferring the administration of af
fairs of the forest reserves to the de
partment of agriculture.
The resolutions enumerated were
all passed after but slight discussion.
Packinghouse merger was also op
posed.
ANTI-MORTEM STATEMENT
The Stricken Editor Gives His Version,
of the Act of Tillman.
Columbia, S. C., Jan. 17.-Editor N.
G. Gonzales made the following ante
mortem statement:
"He said that he had just left his
office andt had started for home. When
some distance from his office he saw
Tillman walking on the street, coming
in the opposite direction. Two men
were with him, one of whom was Sen
ator Talbert, the other he did not
know. They were walking abreast and
as the street was crowded, he would
probably have brushed Tillman in
passing.
To avoid that he walked across the I
pavement, intending to pass on the in
side. As he was doing this Tillman I
fired. For a moment he was dazed and
greatly weakened by the shock. Com
ing to himself he leaned against the
wall of a building for support. After e
firing the shot Tillman said: "I've
done what you told me," and still aim
ed the pistol at Gonzales, who de
nounced him, saying: "You've killed i
me, you coward. shoot again if you
want." Tillman then lowered his pis
tol and walked off.
Being questioned about the report
that .Tillman said "I got your mes- c
sage," Mr. Gonzales said most pos"
tively that he had sent him no mes- c
sage ,4 that his meeting with Mr.
Tillman was totally unexpected and
that he was not armed.
The bullet fired by Tillman pierced
the vital spots of Mr. Gonzales' abdo
men an4 pursued a course. similar to
that in the case oat resident McKin
ley.
James H. Tillman said: "The state
meats already published In the paper
are untrue: and at the proper time I
will be prepasid to show this. Beyond
thia. I do not intend to make any state
rnetL" -
PRAYERS' OFFERED
I athe.ateshools sad Legature Almighty
-A mhked to fpare Gousale's Life.
Columbia, S. C.. Jan. 17.-Friday
morning in the city schools and at the
South Carolina college, prayers were
off eredl for Mr. Gonzales' recovery and
even in the senate chamber, where
Lieutenant Governor Tiliman had pre
sided shortly before the shooting, the
chaplain prayed that the Almighity
would save the life of the stricken edi
tor. While there is a great deal of
jeeling ovewr the affair, it can be said
with positiveness that it is the wish
of Mr. Gonzales and his friends: that
the matter should be left for the courts
to settle.
Refuaed to iPay Tribal Tax.
Ardmore, L T.. Jan. 17.-Cattlemen
in the western portion' of the Chicka
saw- nation are refusing to pay the In
dian .tribal tax of 2ic a head on cattle
in the nation, and the Indian police are
driving out large numbers. One firm
which is grasing over 100,000 head of
cattle has refused to pay the tribal
tax, and the police have orders to eject
..em. This will be done as soon as the
attle can be rounded up,
