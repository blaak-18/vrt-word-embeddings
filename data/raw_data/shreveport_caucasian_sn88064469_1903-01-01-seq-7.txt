the ancient iuthor. who wias i pioneer
In the mnaking of tbooks. compared the
earthly existence of every human life
"to a tale that is told." The seconds
are the letters. The umnutes are the
words. The howrs are the sentences.
The days are the paragraphs. The
weeks are the pages. The months are
the chapters. The years are the books.
The whole number of different books
of the human story of life, like the fve
different books of Victor Hugo's great
novel. "L*es Miserables." are bound to
gether in one big volume, with a slst 3
from the cradle to serve for one cover
and a tombstone used for the otbhe
cover. May God help me on thi laste q
Sabbath of the dying year to Interpret
aright how "we spend our years as a
tale that is told."
The Megiaiasg of the Tole.
Every tale, whether fictitious or no,
has a bright or a sad beginning. In al
most the frst words which the narrator
speaks he introduces his listeoers to the
hero or the heroine. Sometlies be rooks
that heo's cradle down amoul the
plantations of Loulelana or Georgia,
sometimes among the snows of the New
England hills or in a palace of Europe,
where the prince o pr incess was bern.
But, though many heroes and bherolnes
of fictitious tales may have had unhap
py childhood lanuences, I do not be.
lorev it was thus with as. The bright
et paseages of the "tale of life" when
applied to our own biographies ase to
be found for the most peart in those frst
days which we speut in the old home
stead. We never bad those huge mon
stes, the ons of Tartarus and Terra,
to storm our nurseries; we never bhad a
murderous guardian, a King Richard,
to incarcerate as lu a dungeon or a
fiendish Martha of Goethe's "Faust"
for a nurse. Our Infantile pliyground
was more like the Delectable mountains
of Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress."
Therefore, as moseet of our lives have
started amid such purified surround
ings, it is no more than right to expect
that our stories of life should be pure
and true and noble tales.
But, alas, no sooner were we born
and grown into young manhood and
womanhood than the current of our
lives led us away from the purlties of
our youthful home circle. They led
as into the haunts of sin and Into the
cold, damp, dark caverns of selfishness.
You know there are books numbered
among the masterpleces of literature
which you.. as a wise parent. would
not allow in your home. You say to
your wife: "'Ch:lde Harold' may be
the most wonderful portraiture Lord
Byron ever wrote, but it is a characterI
of sin and infamy. It is a character
glowing with poetic Imagination. but '
a character with 'the worm that never
dies' suckltg at its heart. Our chil-t
dren should not be allowed to read its I(
pages." There are stories ~which are '
not fitted for public ears. Our biogra
phles cannot be told to the world at r
large. The beautiful ancient ballad of i
"The Marriage of Sir Gawain" de
scribes how the cavalier of old took
to himself in marriage a hideous wom n
an called the "loathly lady" merely be 1
cause no one else would mai'ry '. e
As soon as the "loathly lady" was w.- t
ded she Immediately changed into a
bride of the most winsome lovelines,
because--o goes the story--that ma'- t
riage ring was able to enchain a male- t
nant enchanter who had been cursing 8

which we had lived. No matter how

S Alanym a F'inilshd Tale.
The rtorr r life Is always aI flinished
t n ale. In the British Natioinal gallery
are a few of the unfinished pictures of
Turner. the famous English landscape
painter. While the great artist, whom
,ohn Iuskin admiired Mo lmuch. was
working upon those canvases the death
angel entered his studio and called
hin, away. Inl the world of story tell
Ing we find many unfinished tales.
Charles Dickens' fingers began to stiff
en in death when he was in the midst
of writing his novel "Edwin Drood."
Another author has tried to finish the
great master's work, but has not been
able to make a success of it. Some
tlimes the authors purposely leave their
stories unfinished. A new school of
writers has lately sprung up who have
tried to imitate Frank Stockton In
"The lardy or the Tiger." These au
thore or story tellers work their read
era up to an Itltense pitch of efcite
ment. Then tl(ey suddenly close their
stories. 'rhey leave their readers to
work out the solution as they please.
Prank Stockton declared that for years
he received hundreds of letters asking
him to solve the problem of that story.
"But." said he. "I am Just as much to
doubt how that book should end as
any of my readers. It was because I I
could not decide whether the young
girl was willing to destroy or save ber t
lover that I ceased writing."
Fletitious stories are often unfinished,
but the human tales about which the i
psalmist wrote are always ultimately I
fintshed tales. 'rhese biographIes may I
lead many of us through' thE school- I
room to the marriage altar. They may
lead us to great honors in life, but I
they will always lead every one of us a
to the grave. When the epitaphs have j
been Inscribed upon our tombstones; I
what has been done will be done for
ever, what has been left undone will I
be left undone forever. The story of t
mortal life will then be ended. The I
earthly covers of the volume will be I
forever closed. We have often heard i
of aged authors recasting and rewrit
Ing the stories they had written in r
their youth. The publishers of the I
"Reveries of a Bachelor" asked its au- e
thor to rewrite his most famous book.
They askedi him to rewrite It long after d
Ik Marvel had ceased to be a bachelor t
and when he had a wife and a crowded I
nursery of his own. But the tale of I
humant life after It has once been fin- I
ished can never be recast. We have I.
heard how one of the sweetest and
purest poets of the west at great ex- d
pense gathered up some vicious and i
Impure stories whichl he had written t
when wh was a college boy. He gath- t
ered theta up to destroy them. But
when the human title of life has been
once told It can never be silenced. It
shall be told and retold again and
again as it was last told at the grave.
Dives in the parable begged Father
Abraham to send back to earth the re
deemed Lazarus to warn his five sinful
brethren. \brahamn would not. "Nay,
nay, nay." tih answered in substance,
"Lazarus' earthly tale of life has been
forever finished." Another word could c
not be added thereto, v
I Spoken Story.
But there is yet one overwhelming s
thought we must not overlook. The ]1
tale of life is a spoken story. We may I
read "The Tale- From the .Egean,"
"TheTanile If a Wayside Inn," "The Ii
Tales Out of School." "Tales of New
England" and "Twicv-tldd Tales;" but, a
after all, the true definition of a tale is t'

"'.We slelnd ourt yers 11 Ii i talet that
is tbil." 'rThat IIllllutn. inl tlih story of
lift. thb lt we' iI't i nilnlit to ptss from
one Iouk to alnother. The year of lI )2
is nearly Ilnished. The y-ear of 1153X
is jlust about to begin.
The passing yc'ar has been a sad one
for many of us. i)urlng the past
twelve months two of my family have
finished their earthly lives, as a tale
that Is told. As I sit writing this dis
course, I hold in my hand one of the
last letters mly father ever wrote to me.
It goes something like this: "Dear
Frank-My last birthday tells we that
I have reached the psalmist's limit
threes.ore years and ten. My earthly
pilgrimage of life will not continue
very much longer." Within a few
molnths that journey ended. How soon
It was to end he little thought. Within
the past year my brother-in-law left
us. leaving behind a widow and her
little children, who are now nearer
and dearer to us on account of their
loss. in your life the year 115)2 has
been a sad year. You have had your
troubles just the same as I. But the
year 1902 has also been a joyful year.
It has been a year of many blessings.
It has also been a year when those who
have left us have goan to be with him
whd is their Saviour mlnd their King.
Iut the year 1902 has also been for
all of us a year of sin. If this chapter
of the tale of life is written, how many
soiled pages there are! Not one of us
has lived up to our many good oppor
tunities. We have been guilty both of
sins of omission and slins of commis
saon. ,lke the psalmist, we have rea
son to cry out in agony, "O God, thou
knowest my foolishness, and my sins
are not hid from thee." But, though
the year 1002 has been a year of many
shortcomings. It may yet be made a
year of divine pardon. There are a
few hours of the old year left. Can
we, shall we not crowd these last few
lines of the book of 1902 full of peni
tent prayers, of earnest and tender
pleadings: full of resolves to undo as
far as we san the wrongs we may have
done to others?
But the time is speeding away, and i
must close. I,lke a dlying invalid, the
breath of the old year is growing short
er and shorter. The pulse Is getting
weaker anmd weaker. What we, are to
do we must do very quickly. Even
now the cold, c(lamlny sweat Is bedew
ing its brow; even 1now tthe eyens are
becoming glassy. Soon there will be a
long gasp. then another, then 1902 will
be dead'
0 my loved ouIos, will yolu nott gta
down upon your knllees tantd 1k Gol (; i
make this year, even in its c.losling
hours, a year of divine pardlolt and t.
umltant hope?
One year. one year. One little yea-',
And so nouch Konet
And yet thre evr'n flow of life
Movem s ertlmly on.
Lord of the living ar.d Ihe dead.
Our H:virinir dear.
We lay in silencoe it thy fret
This sags, :ilt ye-ar.'
