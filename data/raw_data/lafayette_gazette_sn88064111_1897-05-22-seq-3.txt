S DUUBLIC OPINION
Reflected in the Papers of this
Great State.
The villainous and partially successful
method employed by the Trust, as deep
laid and deceptive as it is, has been dis
covered and is being exposed by friends of
the sugar industry, whose eyes have been
op- th Trust' ever sil ce Congress convened.
- The 1ingley bill, as altered by the Senate
Committee, will not only not protect our
home sugar industry, but by granting
special favors to the greatest enemy of the
industry, the Trust, it threatens the gradual
destruction of the American sugar industry.
-Iouma Courier, Dem.
Dixon, the hullabolooist of New YVirk
City, has taken to braying again. This
time he announces from the pulpit that
"men have renounced religion; the ministry
is in its decadence." He added that in that
city only $35,ooo men go into Protestant
c'hurches. He may be right, but if he is it
is because there are too many Dixons in the
pulpit preaching politics - preaching any
thing but the old faith of the fathers.
Bossier Banner, Dem.
The Lafayette Gazette is jubilant over the
.recent great Democratic victory in the mu
nicipal election in that little city. The
town of Lafayette is the stronghold of Re
publicanism in that parish, and that party
had made boasts of their ability to carry the
election which took place there last week.
In this fight it appears that the Republicans
were aided by a considerable number of
disgruntled Democrats and Populists and
this made them ",ery confident of victory.
Hon. Chas. D. Caffery was the Democratic
nominee, and being ably backed by The Ga
zette and by that sterling Democrat, Sheriff
I. A. Broussard, a sweeping and brilliant
victory was achieved and the cause of Re
publicanism in Southwest Louisiana was ad
ministered a crushing blow. In view of the
victory achieved over such a formidable
combination we cannot blame Bro. Mouton
for trotting out his roosters clad in overalls
and crowing lustily over the result.--Baton
Rauge Advocate, Dem.
At last General Longstreet is about to
secure his reward by obtaining a Federal
.~fce.' Ile is to succeed General H-arapton
ss,,ailroad commissioner. It was said a few
weeks ago that no change in the office
would be made, but it scents that General
Longstreet, who ha. been a Republican for
years, must be provided for. As the old
man is unable to support himself and is
nearly deaf, his appointment ought not to be
opposed. Certainly the old Confederates
of Lee's army will not object to it.-Mans
field Journal, )Dem.
The interference of religious creeds in
politics is on 'the increase, and it appears
that the assumption of various creeds to
presume to dictate to nation, State and
civic governments is directed toward christ
ianizing (?) the United States, regardless of
the fact that such proceedure is contrary to
the spirit and letter of the Constitution.

The question of convict labor coming
into competition with free productive labor
is coming more and -more to the front. It
is apparently being looked upon as a prob
lem to solve. I'ut them to work on the
public roads. 'No man living likes to work
upon the public road; he feels like as if he
is occupying a convict's position while he is
doing such work. Let each parish or
country work its convicts upon its own
roads. Good roads will be the result, and
no man will feel that the convicts are en
croaching upon his preserves.-St. Landry
Tribune, Pop.
Bishop Sessums, the Protestant Episcopal
bishop of the Louisiana diocese, is being dis
cussed the country over because of certain
utterances in a lenten sermon. The St.
Louis Post Dispatch says the religious ele
ment of the Mound City is quite a little ex
ercised over the matter. Continuing it says:
"It is asserted that the bishop expounded
an entirely new doctrine, which substituted
for the teachings of the bible a broad hu
manitarianism, recognizing the universe as
God, and the final pardon of all sinners,
whether baptized or not."-Lake Charles
Press, Dem.
If there were anything better than
the best then we'd aim for that.
The BUCKSKIN RREECHES
have got everything in them that
best use means. We'd like to make
them better still but don't know
how. Maybe if you bought a pair
and put them to the test, you could
help us improve them.
The refusal of Sir Julian Paunce
fote, British Ambassador, to attend
the Grant Monument certmnonies
unless he should be given a place
next to the president and be given
prl ecedence over the vice-president,
has so wrought dpon Senator Stew
art of Nevada that he has written a
poem dedicated to "'His Highness,
Sir Jtilian." The following is his
Byronic gem:
How beautiful it is to note
The great Sir Julian Pauncefote.
In grand affairs of quick or dead,
He always marches at the head;
And when he fails to have his way,
Why, then, Sir Julian P. won't play.
Let's hurry up with arbitration,
Ere war declares Sir Julian's station.
One would hardly expect to find
such youth and exhubetance be
neath the long whit beard and
patriarchal appearance of the Sena
tor from Nevada.-Iberville South.
AiR. BAILEY AND DRESS
SUI TS.
Congressman Bailey from Texas
has been subjected to some severe
criticisms because he would not
wear what is known among society
folks as a dress suit. The Gazette
has already stated that it believed
the Texan was the best judge of
what kind of clothes he should wear
and if he chose not to use the fash
ionable *-claw hammer," it was no
one's business but his own. But
certain newspapers jumped up and
called him a Populist because he
did not care to ape the toad-eaters
at the nation's capital. The funny
men of the press took advantage of
the opportunity to dispose of their
surplus humor and put words into
Mr. Bailey's mouth that no one but
a driveling idiot would have uttered.
After paying his respects to the news
papers who have misrepresented him,
Mr. Bailey ended a very sensi
ble article with the following re
marks:
I am more liberal than my.critics in re
spect to these matters. I do not criticise
them because they accept invitations to din
ner and wear dress suits; 'and they :do criti
cise me becatuse I decline invitations to din
ner and do not wear a dress suit.
The question of whether I will wear a
dress suit or not is a question of time. as
well as a question of taste, with me. I
know very well that those who choose to
participate in the social life of Washington
will find it extremely pleasant, but I know
also that it consumes a vast deal of valuable
time. Many gentlemen consider the
pleasure worth the time which it costs, but I
do not. If I prefer to spend my time in less
pleasant though more profitable pursuits, I
have the right to do so, and the half-hu
morous raillery in which the newspapers
have indulged will not be apt to change my
opinion or my conduct.
I cannot understand why great news
papers devote columns to such a trifling
matter, but if their editors and their cor
respondents find any pleasure in writing
about it, or if they think- that their patrons
will find any amusements in reading about
it, I shall not complain. The phase of the
comments which I most seriously resent is
the assertion that I am attempting to in
crease my popularity at home. I resent
that, not so much because it imputes a dis
creditable motive to me, as because it as
sumes that my constituents can be influenced
by such a small consideration.
The truth is that no one man out of a
hundred in my district crres anything about
my clothes so long as they are clean and
fantastic. My constituents are just as far
from being ruffians as they are from being
dudes.
They have long since passed that stage of
civilization where six-shooters and spurs are
considered personal ornaments, but I am
glad to say that they have not reached that
other stage of civilization where the men
use perfume and wear corsets, and the
women smoke cigarettes and wear bloomers.
They are wholesome, sensible Americans,
who .:are infinitely more about what their
Representative thinks than they do about
what he wears. JosIst',t W. BIAIL.EY.
