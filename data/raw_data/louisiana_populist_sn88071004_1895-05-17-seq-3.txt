On last Saturday night at a ne
gro collation.at Shedrick Brown's
Hall, this cityg Henry Roherts,
(col.) was shot and killed, and Edl
ward Brown, (col.) was severely
wounded, and gaiu Simmons, white,
received a slight wound.
It seems that the city police had
been called in to eject somie bois
terous negroes, who resisted. Some
white men present joined in the
effort ot the officers, and a melee
ensed with the above result.
It ir to be deplored that such
harsh and unwarranted extremes
hboei be resorted to by any rep
resentative of a peace omleer and
assistants.

DUPLEIX - NORRIS. - At
Mansfield, La., on Wednesday, May
Sl.h, 1P95, Mr. Louis Durvrxx of
this city, to Miss FANNY NoRaIs of

this city and has many friends who
welcomed him and has fair bride
on their arrival. We wish them a
happy and prosperous journey
through life.
The Gaunmlet Throewn Down
The Town Talk, a Democratic
organ published in the city of
Alexandria, declares that we need
no ballot reform until after the
election in April of next year, at
which time the amendment to the
constitution it hoped would be car
ried. The Town Talk might also
have added that it expected the
amendment to be carried by fraud
ulent election methods.
This same amendment to the
constitution provides for a quali
fied suffrage, and further provides
that in subsequent years that the
power to change this portion of
our organic law be vested within
the Legislature, taking it out of
the hands of the common people.
Then if this infamous, damnable,
and hell born amendment is count
ed in as the Town Talk very com
placently admits by its position it
will be, this State is delivered into
the hands of the red handed assas
ins of liberty and cold-blooded crn
cifiers of justice, till the people
rise up in righteous indignation
and arm the great labor hand with
the sword of retributive justice
and with one herculean effort drive
the villains at its dripping point
out of the temples of our fathers
and return the government to its
rightful poeseesors.
The perfidy of the Town Talk is
not by any sort of means hidden or
disguised by the mantle it under
takes to draw over the true in
wardneas of its real position by
claiming that no reform in the
election methods of this state is
necessary until after the amend
ment to the constitution can be
doneted, and this will place the
people completely at the mercy of
the public plaunders.
There can be no neutralit upo-
this grave and important qnestion.
Those who are not in favor of hon
eat eleetions, are in favor of eor
'~4our who are not in favor of
this system of stuing ballot boxes
being put down NOW are ia favor
of its continatioo, and will so use
and exert their iilueafoe.
If ballot rsorm is not dmeirable
NOW, it coold be maid with loat as

April 5.-ly.
residence of the proprietor was to
catch on fire, the editor would rush
out into the street and riotously
protest that the fire department not
be summoned until the houses were
in ashes, and then so far as saving
his buildings was concerned the
service of the department would
not be needed.
By this time half the city would
be on fire, to follow out his in
struction, when if the fire depart
ment had been summoned to the
scene at the outset the disaster
could have been averted.
This question of hampering the
elective franchise by an education
al qualification is all a movement
that is tending toward the estab
lishment of an aristocratic form of
government.
To qualify the suffrage of the
individual voters of a common
wealth, is to seek to strike the
death blow at the God-given rights
of the people, and to mark the be
ginning of the end of the liberties
of the most patriotic people who
have lived in any age of the world.
If it is right to say that a vo
ter who can't read and expound
the constitution must own $200
worth of property before he can
vote, then it could be increased to
$10,000 with just as much compla
cency.
Whenever the right to govern
does not come from the consent of
the governed, it cannot be longer
said truthfuily that such people
are enjoying the free and full rits
of liberty.
The ualiflcation of the suffrage
of the individual voter is the step
ping stone to attempt to perpetu
ally place this government in the
hands of the rich, depriving the
poor of any rights except to eke
out their lives in hovels, working
all the days of their lives for the
pleasure of the potentates who
rule them with the iron hand of
merciless despotism.
If the people of this country are
prepared to accept this condition
of things, then they can give their
endorsement to the position of the
Town Talk, assist in counting in
the proposed amendment, and then
join in one chorus; "Masters, here
we are, take charge of us and do
with us that best pleases you."
Send in your Job work. We
will do it neat and cheap.
