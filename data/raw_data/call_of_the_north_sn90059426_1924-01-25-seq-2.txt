It is rarely, if ever, that mankind
realizes the transition from one age
to another. We may not do so now.
The new age was perhaps on the way
several years before we began to no
tice it. But the time is upon us now
when mighty forces of social trans
formation are in operation. The
function of good citizenship is then
to so direct and control the public
mind and give the people the vision
of the new age, that the present
great opportunity may not lead to
disaster, rather than to achievement.
Stanley Frost in “The Outlook” for
December 19, 1923, has commenced a
series of articles on the Ku Klux
Klan, “the Giant in the White Hood.”
He has learned the Klan can neither
be lied, ridiculed or frightened out of
existence, and that its immense and
rapid growth proves that the move
ment “has an appeal to some deep
seated sentiment, instinct, prejudice,
condition, or whatever you care to
call it—something widespread, fun
damental and very much alive.”
He claims the near future will
show whether it is “insanity or in
spiration.” He is of the opinion that
all the opposition to and persecution
of the Klan has but speeded up its
growth. Mr. Frost admits the gi
gantic political power of the Klan
with 4,000,000 members and trembles
to think what it will be when another
million shall be added. He also sees
the other million coming into its
ranks in a short time.
So there is a change in the public
opinion of the nation regarding the
Klan, and that change is growing
into wonder at its power and pro
gress. This is the close of a great
year for our Order. It is also the
beginning of another year greater
beyond all computation. Our power
to control the nation shall be great,
but greater beyond all measure is and
DAILY NEWSPAPER
The daily newspapers have again
taken a rap at the Klan. My, what
a wallop they gave us this time! But
in a couple of issues the thing is
over—the “hurricane” had passed
and once more quiet reigns.
We presume such periodical spasms
are a part of their daily editorial
curriculum, so we are willing. The
enemy may have cause to gloat over
such yellow journalism and if it gets
any consolation out of that kind of
work, we suppose it is all right.
Fine reading, Klansmen, isn’t it,
to hear how the Klan has been shat
tered into Smithereens, rent asunder
and annihilated. But why doesn’t the
Klan “die?” says someone.
We will tell you: All the forces
of Hades turned loose in America
can’t kill the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan! Such wonderful principles
will never die! Lambasting the Klan
only tends to make it grow. Where
is the force on earth that can put
down those mighty principles of ours
—ONE GOD, ONE FLAG, ONE
SCHOOL, ONE COUNTRY! Those
four splendid fundamentals spell
the greatest word in the English
language today:
Americanism!
Where is there a red-blooded man
or woman within our shores who
would not stand by those principles?
“America is for Americans!”
Never was there a truer sentence
uttered than that daily almost
throughout our land. Sermons are
being preached from our Protestant
pulpits upon the subject of Ameri
canism. Do the daily newspapers
print those sermons? They do not.
And for why?
Because of an alien influence that
has, octopus-like, thrown its long
arms about a great many of our un-
American newspaper publishers. That
is the truth told in no uncertain
terms.
Many American newspaper publish
ers today are tied hand and foot to
“BACK TO CHURCH” MOVE IS A
SUCCESS
Morristown, N. J. —The “back-to
church” campaign, started by the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, cover
ing every district of Morris county,
is meeting with more success than
the leaders of the local organization
anticipated in the beginning.
Each Sunday night Klan services
are held in six or seven churches.
The attendance and interest has not
been limited to members of the or
ganization—everybody goes.
Exceptionally fine co-operation has
been received from the ministers, re
gardless of their affiliations or per
sonal attitude. The spirit is not lim
ited to the ministers, but has been
manifested by the public, which is
clamoring for a wider range of ac
tivity of the Klan services.

shall be our responsibility to guide it
right. The highest dedication and
consecration to this holy service is
the call of duty and of God to each
one of us.
Let us see that nothting smaller
than this great aim is allowed to
creep into our minds or hearts. Let
us make a New Year resolution that
we will turn every impulse of our
mind, our heart and our hand to the
public service nearest us to do.
Let us choose the right kind of a
governor for Washington and the
right kind of a mayor for Seattle.
Let us pass a public school educa
tional bill.
Let us pass the Towner-Sterling
bill.
Let us elect the right kind of state
and local public officers who dare to
be right.
Let us cling to the national bud
get system and strict economy in
government.
Let us clean up and build up our
own state.
Let us elect a President of the
United States and senators and con
gressmen who will help us do these
things without faltering or equivoca
tion.
Let us be worthy of the most sub
lime lineage in all history—American
citizenship.
We shall grow so long as we live
up to this sacred trust. The Order,
the nation, the world, mankind and
civilization need such high consecra
tion to duty. Shall we falter or fail ?
We have set in motion high and tre
mendous forces. We have aroused in
opposition to them all the powers of
darkness and wrong. We cannot—
we dare r.ot refuse or fail to acquit
ourselves like real men. The battle
is joined already.—The Watcher on

Rome. Her bidding must be done.
Did anyone residing in Dayton ever
see a line printed in either of our
three dailies favorable in any way to
the Ku Klux Klan?
Not much!
There, dear reader, is your alien
influence at work in our own home
town. Next to the enemy itself, the
politician, the gambler, the bootleg
ger and the foreigner are all fight
ing the Klan. The reason for this is
they fear the cleanup that positively
is getting results. The Klan is mak
ing America better day by day, but
it works so effectively and so quietly
that few know the wonderful things
that are being accomplished.
The Klan isn’t dying. Nor is it
going to die. The truth is that thou
sands of fine men and women all over
this country are answering the clar
ion call to Americanism daily.
And there is one sure bet— that
the newspapers can’t kill the Ku Klux
Klan! It’s been tried too often.
Every time the press lets out that
familiar wail the Klan takes a new
hold on the bits and that makes us
better Klansmen.
The world has never seen a move
ment to equal the Ku Klux Klan! One
hundred per cent Americans are
everywhere. Patriotism for Ameri
can principles is the spur that goads
on the American millions to their
goal—a cleaner America. The growth
of the Klan, indeed, is gratifying
everywhere. Not a tremor ever has
been felt within the organization
that would tend to make us belieyn
that the Klan is losing ground or that
the people of America need a foreign
potentate to tell us what is best for
us, so if that is a sign that the Klan
is going to stay among us, then we
shall rest assured that Old Glory
will continue to wave over every
schoolhouse wherein the Holy Bible is
taught to oncoming generations.—

POLICE DASH HERE
AND THERE; RETURN
Brooklyn, N. Y.—“ The police from
Brooklyn stations spent several hours
recently in a futile search for mem
bers of the Ku Klux Klan,” says a
newspaper account of the activities
of the police of this city. It was al
leged that six automobiles were
speeding along Kings highway be
tween Church and Snyder avenues,
bound for some point where a Klan
meeting was scheduled.
Flatbush reserves were the first to
appear in the chase, but arrived too
late at the scene where pedestrians
had reported the activities of the
Klan. The police asserted any mem
ber of the Order would be arrested
on the charge of disorderly conduct,
if found.

A6AIN RAP ALAN
At last the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan has formed an auxiliary
organization which permits ineli
gibles to the Klan to join an organ
ization associated with the Klan and
working unitedly for the common
purpose of a better America.
The four R's, the Royal Riders of
the Red Robe is the order referred to
and today is being organized in many
places. For a long time such a move
had been contemplated by Klan
leaders. When the Klan was organ
ized it was evident that for instance
Canadians were near-eligibles, but
while no doubt adopting our creed,
could not be allowed to come into
such membership. To offset this a
new auxiliary has come into being,
as given in detail in the following
article:
Editor In Chief
The organization is in no sense a
competitor of the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan, but may, on the other
hand, be considered an auxiliary of
that great patriotic organization
which of necessity excludes foreign
bom citizens from its membership.
In keeping with the high purposes
and patriotic principles of the “Roy
al Riders” its ritualistic features are
inspiring and soul-stirring. Its re
galia, official titles and other dis
tinguishing characteristics are uni
que and pleasing. The secrecy with
which its personnel is clothed pro
tects them from the attacks of those
who oppose defenders of American
ism.
Founded by Dr. Martin W. Rose,
now Imperial Regent, with head
quarters in Portland, the organiza
tion has branched out to all sections
of the United States in response to
the immediate and insistent demands
made by those who saw it in the one
effective medium of unifying some
millions of our best citizenship in a
common cause.
The large foreign bom population
of the large cities, as well as of ur
ban centers throughout the United
States, is expected to rally to the
Royal Riders of the Red Robe, the one
organization that has adopted and is
carrying out a program of aggressive
and constructive Americanism.
Leaders of the several racial
groups who inculcate the ideals of
true Americanism into the hearts of
their fellows, Americans of foreign
birth whose love for “Oly Glory” is
as unquestioned as that of those
legions that fought under the “Stars
and Stripes” overseas, and represent
atives of those very legions will be
called together in a short time to out
line the organization campaign in
many states.
Thousands of men, who except for
the accident of foreign birth, would
now be members of the Klan, have
Seven Symbols of the Klan
By W. C. Wright, Plainview, Texas
The language of symbolism is the
most beautiful, the most impressive
and the most expressive of any lang
uage known to mankind. Who can
read the story of Noah’s Ark with
out thinking of the Church; or the
story of the scapegoat, the brazen
serpent or the feast of the Passover
without thinking of the Christ who
takes away all of our iniquities and
delivers us from the bondage of sin?
In the sublime ceremonies of Klan
craft, I take it that we use seven
significant symbols, each of which
conveys and inculcates a very beauti
ful lesson, and emphasizes a great
Klan principle, when the language of
symbols is properly understood. They
are, in order of their importance: The
Bible, the Cross, the Flag, the Sword,
the Water, The Robe and the Mask.
This Book Divine signifies that
there is a God. No sane man of rea
sonable intelligence can look upon
this sacred volume without thinking
of God as its author, righteousness
as its aim, and eternal life as its end.
It is a constant reminder that God
is our Father, life is our opportunity
and Heaven is our Home. It reveals
the way of life and the cause of
death. It is a lamp unto our feet, a
light unto our pathway, and the
only sure guide to right living. It
is the book or books and reveals the
only true God.
In a Klavern you will always find
this wonderful Book opened at the
twelfth chapter of Romans. This is
the most practical and the most com
plete chapter in the whole Bible for
Christian living. It is a constant re
minder of the tents of the Christian
religion and is a Klansman’s law of
life. Every Ktansman should read
it the first thing every morning and
endeavor to live by it during the day.
“I beseech you therefore brethren by
the mercies of God” that you follow
its teachings.
Out of the wonderful story of the
sacred pages of this old Book Divine
comes the sad, sweet story of Cal
vary’s rugged but holy cross. This
old cross is a symbol of sacrifice and
service, and a sign of the Christian
religion. Sancutified and made holy
nearly nineteen centuries ago by the
suffering and blood of fifty million
martyrs who died in the most holy
faith, it stands in every Klavern of
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan as
a constant reminder that Christ is
our criterion of character, and His
teachings our rule of life-blood

already signified their intention not
only of joining the new organization,
but of working aggressively for it.
It is pointed out that the Royal
Riders of the Red Robe is the only
organization in which native and na
turalized Americans can meet on a
common plane for a common cause
with all racial distinction wiped out—
all “Royal Riders” are Americans,
and ‘Americans only.
Protestants from the United King
dom, Sweden, Norway, Canada, Ger
many, and other countries in Europe
who left their homes in the old world
and deliberately chose to become
Americans because of the high ideals
of our citizenship and the opportun
ities for greater achievements have
long sought an agency through which
they might assert their Americanism.
Many splendid and powerful organ
izations have been developed by the
several groups but until the forma
tion of the “Royal Riders” there has
been no combination of all interests
in one constructive combination.
Again it is pointed out that many
Americans who have come to this
country to escape the tyrannies of
the Roman Catholic church and the
evils of church domination over po
litical governments have had little
opportunity to make their experience
valuable to those native-born Ameri
cans who have so far escaped Papal
domination. The new organization
affords them that opportunity and is
proving • great power for the pro
tection of this country against the
encroachments of those agenqies that
make life a misery in many countries
across the sea.
Appreciating the fact that immi
gration must not only be greatly re
stricted, but that foreigners who
have come to America must be in
culcated with that spirit of Ameri
canism which can only come through
close association and personal con
tact with the best representatives of
our people, Klansmen see in the
“Royal Riders” an opportunity for
supplementary service and at the
same time a chance for a broaden
ing and educational influence that
will prove beneficial to themselves.
With large foreign-born popula
tions in our large cities and in the
scores of mining and manufacturing
towns it is expected that organiza
tions of the “Royal Riders” will be
formed immediately. Naturalized
Americans in these centers have long
awaited an opportunity to take an
active part in such work as is being
done so successfully by the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan.
Directors of the preliminary work
have suggested that those interested
in organization should communicate
the nearest state headquarters.
bought, holy sanctified and sublime.
It was once a sign of ignominy, dis
grace and shame; but being bathed in
the blood of the lowly Nazarene, it
has been transformed into a symbol
of Faith, Hope and Love. It inspired
the Crusaders of the Middle Ages in
their perilous efforts to rescue the
Holy Land from the heathen Turks;,
and is today being used to rally the
forces of Christianity against the
ever increasing hoards of anti-Christ
and the enemies of the principles of
a pure Americanism.
We have added the fire to signify
that “Christ is the light of the
world.” As light drives away the
darkness and gloom, so a knowledge
of the truth dispels ignorance and
superstition. As fire purifies gold,
silver and precious stones, but de
stroys the dross, wood, hay and stub
ble, so by the fire of Calvary’s cross
we mean to purify and cleanse our
virtues by burning out our vices with
the fire of His word. Who can look
upon this sublime symbol, or sit in
its sacred, holy light without being
inspired with a holy desire and deter
mination to be a better man? “By
his sign we conquer.”
The Flag
This old flag, purchased by the
blood and suffering of American he
roes, represents the price paid for
American liberties. It is the symbol
of the Constitution of the United
States of America, free speech, free
press, free schools, freedom of wor
ship, and all Constitutional laws,
both state and national.
Its red is the blood of American
heroes that stained a hundred battle
fields. Its white symbolizes the pur
ity of American womanhood and the
sanctity of American homes. Its
blue is but a patch of America’s un
clouded sky, snatched from the dia
mond studded canopy that bends ov
er our native land. Its stars repre
sent an aggregation of undefeated
states bound together in an insepar
able union.
“Its red is the red of the sunset’s
evening glow,
Its white is the white of the winter’s
driven snow,
Its blue is the blue of the ocean sea
and sky,
Its stars the states of a union that
muist never die.”
It has never been trailed in the
dust, trampled in the mud, or defeat
ed in battle. It has never led a re
treat or been hauled down at the
command of an enemy. It is the'

THE FIRST GR
The first foot ~of film of scenes
ever made of the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan in action is being shown
at Memorial Hall, Dayton, Ohio.
Immense crows are attending and
the wonderful reception, “The Toll of
Justice,” has received from the Day
ton public is indeed gratifying, not
only to the management, but to every
patriot whose soul has been stirred to
its very depths by its tone of 100 per
cent Americanism.
The “Toll of Justice,” and it has
been rightly named, has for its in
troductory part, a lesson in patriot
ism which has been aroused for the
first time, within the bosom of a
sturdy youth, and reflects on down
through the various periods of the
militant chapter of our great Ameri
can history-making periods and grips
the audience from the outset as one
of the very cleanest pieces of Ameri
can fiction ever produced anywhere.
The predominating thought of the
author has been the protection of
pure womanhood and to clean our
country of filth. The cast is well
chosen, reflecting upon its producer
most favorable comment where it has
been shown. •
The play is new, just put out to
the public, and those who have seen
it are a unit in saying there is not
a cleaner, more fascinating, better
balanced play in America today.
The story has to do with James
Dale, a man of position and influ
ence, head of the great Dale Motor
Corporation, a clean, self-made man.
Two lovely daughters, Aileen, whose
nature has molded into a model of
sweet womanhood and Billy, a dash
ing young thing, filled with the spirit
of the times. Tom Grant, an en
gineer, who has steadily climbed the
ladder from office boy, himself a re
fined young man, and Saunders, the
clerk, who, through bad company and
drugs, has begun the downward jour
ney. Haskell resorts to unfair meas
ures as suitor of the beautiful Aileen,
the sweetheart of Tom Grant, and
through his villainous scheming, he is
sent to death. The latter, finding he
cannot win the love of his rival’s
sweetheart, resorts to brute force.
He is apprehended with his gang of
un-Americans in his den, an old de
serted house, where he takes his cap
tive, the beautiful Aileen, daughter
of the motor king, and binds and gags
the unfortunate girl. Dashing Billy,
the sister, forces her way into the
dilapidated house and, with the aid
of the Klan, rescues the all but crazed
woman just in the nick of time.
The thrill of the entire play comes
when swooping birdmen enter and
make things exciting with airplane
battles high above the clouds with
another plane. Meanwhile, the fair

the sacrifice and blood of our fath
ers, and we have most sacredly
vowed that we will uphold and de

property, our blood and our lives
May we ever be true to our vow.
Under its fluttering folds, as it floats
in the gentle breeze in every Klav
ern, the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
will forever defend the principles of
a pure Americanism, and thus per
petuate the sacred memory of our
venerable and heroic dead.
Who can stand under these Stars
and Stripes, remembering the sacred
traditions that entwine about its holy
past, without feeling that sublime
patriotism that inspired our noble
sires to die for our own, our native
land?
This unsheathed sword of steel is
a symbol of law enforcement. It rep
resents the military or enforcement
powers of our government, from the
president down to the constable. Its
presence on our sacred altar signifies
that we, as an organization, are sol
idly behind every enforcement officer
in the land, to “help, aid and assist in
the proper performance of their legal
duties.” We stand unconditionally
and unqualifiedly for the just and
impartial enforcement of law, and
for the defence and protection of all
rights and privileges of all citizens
alike, regardless of race, color, creed,
lineage or tongue.
This sword also signifies that we
are set for the defense of our Flag,
and all that it symbolizes, against
the attack and invasion of every for
eign power, government, sect, ruler
or people in the whole world. We
believe in America for Americans,
and are sworn to defend it by all
justifiable means and methods, from
any encroachment whatever, from
any source whatever, whether it be
traitors within or enemies without.
This sword is a constant reminder of
our obligation to defend our country
and enforce its laws, through duly
constituted authorities and justifi
able means and methods. May we
wield it wisely and well in defense of
our country, our home, our flag, our
liberties and humanity.

This part of the production holds
great interest, from the fact that the
scenes were made at Fairfield during
the past summer by Dayton fliers.
The story is replete with love,
thrills and excitement every minute.
The villain fights like a madman
the beautiful girl who spurns his
love, seeking the while to drag her to
the depths. The hero falls into a
trap set by this worker of iniquity
and is cast into prison. This devil
ish, intrigueing monster is but one
type of the un-American today who
fears the force of the Ku Klux Klan
in its clean-up of America. He hates
it for what it is worth to the right
eous cause of Americanism.
There are times when the audience
laughs and, at other times the heart
leaps for joy and swells with pride
when those gallant Kluxers come
forth to tjie rescue. One is brought
to tears many times, so true are the
lessons brought home to him.
Twenty thousand Klansmen, in full
reglia, were filmed at the great Buck

part, in body, in mind, in spirit and in
life, to the sacred, sublime and holy
principles of Klancraft. In this ded
icatory service are solemnly admon
ished to keep our character as trans
parent and as clear and clean as the
liquid in this glass. A drop of ink
or blood in this crystal fluid will have
the same effect as sin in our lives.
May we keep our record clear and
transparent, free from the sin-stains
of evil and wrong doing.
As water is useful to human life,
so may we, as Klansmen, be useful to
humanity. As drops of water mingle
and intermingle, thus becoming one
solid mass, may we, as Klansmen be
come one solid mass, or one body in
Klancraft. Thus we see that water
is a beautiful symbol of unity, use
fulness and purity. Who can fail to
learn from these drops of water, the
lesson of real Klannishness, and of
brotherhood in a common service to
mankind ?
The Robe
“The distinguished marks of a
Klansman are not found in the fiber
of his garments, or in his social, po
litical or financial standing; but they
are spiritual, viz: a chivalric head, a
compassionable heart, a prudent
tongue and a courageous will; all de
voted and consecrated to our coun
try our homes, our Klan and each
other.”
We uste the robe to signify that we
do not judge men by the clothes they
wear, and to conceal the difference
in our clothing as well as our per
sonality. There are no rich or poor,
high or low, in Klancraft. As we
look upon a body of Klansmen robed
in white we are forcibly reminded
that they are on a common level. By
this means we also help to conceal
our identity, which is an essential
principle of Klancraft.
This white robe is also a symbol of
that robe of righteousness to be worn
by the saints in the land of Yet-to-
Come. The aged apostle, a prisoner
on the isle of Patmos, peeped into the
portals of the Great Beyond, and
caught a glimpse of the saints robed
in white, “which wag the righteous
ness of Christ.” Taking Christ as
our criterion of character, and en
deavoring to follow His teachings,
Klansmen wear this white robe to
signify that they desire to put on
that white robe which is the right
eousness of Christ, in that Empire
Invisible, that lies out beyond the
vale of death where there will be
no more parting and no more lean.

No tender kiss to be given,
No nicknames, “Dove” and “Mouse,”
No merry frolics after tea—
No baby in the house.

“What a Grass Widow Knows” is

about 10,000,000 pages.
of a Klansman’s robe and deceive the
very elect, but only a Klansman pos
sesses a Klansman’s heart, and a
Klansman’s soul.” Therefore, as we
seek to cover here our filthy rags
and imperfect lives with the robe of
a Klansman, may we through the
grace of God and by following His
Christ, be able to hide the scars and
stains of sin with the righteousness
of Christ when we stand before His
Great White Throne.
The Mask
That hated mask, the terror of ev
ery crook in the land, how they cry,
“take off the mask.” But they don’t
know what they say. They do not
understand why we wear it or what
it means. If they only knew.
In the first place it helps to con
ceal our membership. The secret of
our power lies in the secrecy of our
membership. We are a great secret
service organization to aid the offi
cers of the law and we can do our
best work when we are not known to
the public. By this means we see and
hear everything. We know the crim
inal but he does not know us. By
our secret membership we gather a
world of evidence and help to gather
thousands of crooks into the meshes
of the law that would otherwise es
cape.
It is a symbol of unselfishness.
With the mask we hide our individu
ality and sink ourselves into the
great sea of Klancraft. Not as indi
viduals, but as Klansmen, “we sacri
fice to serve.” Our motto is, “Non
Silba Sed Anthar—not for self but
for others.” Therefore we hide self
behind the mask that we may be un
selfish in our service.
Who can look upon a multitude of
white robed Klansmen without think
ing of the equality and unselfishness
of that throng of white robed saints
in the Glory Land? May the God of
Heaven, Who looks not upon the out
ward appearance, but upon the heart,
find every Klansman worthy of the
robe and mask that he wears. Then
when we “do the things we teach”
and “live the lives we preach” the
title of Klansman will be the most
honorable title among men.
Thus with our symbols we seek to
emphasize and impress the sacred,
sublime and holy principles of Klan
craft. With God as our Father,
Christ as our criterion, the Bible as
our guide, the cross as our inspira
tion, and the flag as our protection,
we mean to march on to a trium
phant victory for the principles of
right in the Knights of the Ku Khuc
Kkn.
