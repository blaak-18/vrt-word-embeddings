EDITOR POPULIST:
s I wish to say that farmers are
making preparations for growing
another crop, the best they can
do, -taking their condition at pres- n
ent into account. There are many a
I farmers throughout the country a
3 that will not be able to get any tt
oredit until very late, if at all, and t]
then in very limited amounts. I 0
learn that G. W. Bolton and B.
Turner, of Pineville, say cotton is
so low that they expect to carry
g but few customers, commencing
u about the 1st of April with them,
1 and of course, quitting about the
i first of July. Now the money
question is at the bottom of all
this financial ruin and disaster. A 1
continuation of falling prices means I
the sure falling of this country
s and the people with it.
d We are travelling the old Roman
' road to ruin and decay. When
Alarie, King of the Goths, inva
ded Italy and besieged Rome, the
people had been so unmercifully
Staxed and mortgaged that they had
no apparent interest in the Ro
man government, eentralization of
I wealth had gone on so long that
Sthe viek were very rich, and the
pooeer very peeoor, and as a cones
It quence the poor had nothing to
' ght for, and flatly refused to take
Sup armsin defense of their coun
.try (or their landlords' country).
Gi dbsn rays, at this time concen
tration of wealth, which began un
der the reign of Augustus, at the
llbegm ng of the christian era,
hadsacumulated all the gold and
alver in the cities and trade cen
ters. The head of government
under Honorus, and the trmaunry
e- had been remaoved to the strongly
b fortied city of Ravenna, at the
mouth of the river Poe. The rich
Splutoerrs of the city of Rome
mannfactured thei silver into
n masy mideboard, etc., and the
church had comaiderable gold res
als and ornaments for the church
es o Bomn.
SThe -y tremary was empty,
*and the poor refusead to fght, and
s the rich sacoundrels were draid to
a ght, and Alari with his Gothic
s army encamped under the walls of
-Bon, (the Afrst enemy to reach
tat pain fur 019 years). Alaric
durnaded 1Z,ooo lbs of gold and
S90,000 Ibsa o silver as atribtae to
mladce hlm to evacaste the city.
There was a mouy in the tream-
ry, d the silver uidsbar-s ad

of gold were put in the scales and
weighed until the amount was ob
tained and paid over. But Alaric,
although a barbarian, kept his
word and evacuated, just like Bel- un
mont, Morgan & Co., did the other
day in Washington. They came
over to Washington and besieged o
the United States treasury, and
when king Grover, Carlise & Co., at
gave them the assurance that ,
Rothschild's & Co., of London, it
should have the entire issue of 65 of
millions of bonds at the exorbi
tant rate of 41 per cent, they, -
like Alaric, evacuated.
Now we are travelling the same
route, and the same result may
reasonably be expected, without
a halt is called, and that at once.
Success to the POPULIST.

False Prophets,
Certain self appointed prophets
in this parish are taking great'
pains to spread their foolish pre
dictions that the people's party
will not carry Natchitoches at the
election next spring.
SLet's see, they carrned it by 486
"majority less than 6 months ago,
against a free silver democrat who
e belonged to that faction of the
7 democratic party which is strong
d est in this parish, and who pro
fessed to advoote almost every
reform the populists demanded.
Instead of losing any votes since
that time the populists have gained
in every ward in the parish and
some of their gains have been
e leading and inluential citisens,
like many that already compose
Sthe party. This majority will
- continue to grow as the democratic
n- party continues to bow in humble
ae servitude to Wall street as it has
, so eagerly done during the present
administration. /
To say that this majority is to
n- be set aside, is to say that the good
at people of this parish who have
y now seen with their own eyes that
fair elections mean white suprem
aye aynd foul elections mean negro
domination in the hands of cor
uh rupt and schming politicians, are
ng ngto allow themselves to be
to d back into the loathsome
e pctis of frlad,, bribery and
perjury from which they so eagerly
0 broke away at the last election.
h- The democratic party is wel
come to all the weak-kned desert
ers that can be frightened away
y, from us by such tpollbh amd idle
d propheiesi
