Senator Henry McCall feels soc
bad over the removal from office of
the national Republicans by the fo
governor that he has resigned his cc
position as member of the board of sc
supervisors of the A. and M. Col- is
lege.. The governor evidently tails in
to understand how a man can be a o
snational Republican and a State c1
Democrat. tr
Is that not a curious exemption p
which the proposed new law of libel
, inl Vermont makes when it says that tt
women shall not be subject to its
pstvision, that any one wilfully
giving to a newspaper matter which
shall turn out to be libellous shall it
be guilty of misdemeanor. Is this a
a flint that women cannot tell the
truth or avoid circulating baseless
S gossip, and should therefore not be
punished, or what is it?
