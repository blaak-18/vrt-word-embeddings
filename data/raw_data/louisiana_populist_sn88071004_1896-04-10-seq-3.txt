The White Election Proposliton.
(Continued from 2nd Page.
Third-The Democratic and Pop
ulist party are to use their joint
efforts in preventing the negroes
from participating in the election
on April 21st, 1896.
Fourth--This obligation is en
- tered into in good faith by the two
parties, with the desire that the
white people shall control the af
o fairs and offices of this parish and
we obligate ourselves to carry it
out in spirit and effect.
Fifth-The Commissioners to be
appointed by both sides are to en
ter into the spirit of this agree- 1
ment.
7 Sixth-No technicality of the
law or informality in election are
to thwart the desire of the white
people in their choice for ward of
ficers.
Seventh--We the undersigned I
candidates for office in the parish
of Natchitoches, at the coming
a election on the 21st of April, 186,
hereby agree to the above and
foregoing and obligate ourselves.
to abide by the result.
D Eighth-The Commissioners to
be appointed as soon after this
© agreement is signed, as possible.
The first 4 clauses are w:'itten in
my handwriting, and the last 4 in 1
Mr. Scarborough's, (I have the
I original) however, we three would
decide on each clause as it was
written, and the whole is really the
work of the three present.
This occurred on a Saturday, at
E the time Mr. C. V. Porter was in
Richland parish, harmonizing the
Democratic party ; on the next I
m )rning I saw Mr. Porter, and
told him about the agreement. Hlie
assured me it met with his np
proval, and he would submit it to
the Democratic campaign commit- a
tee. Things did not develop for a
few d tys. I several tim.es asked t
Mr. Porter about the a reoment,
and he told me to have Mr. Cook, t
secretary of the Democratic cam
paign committee to write up some
copies. We did nothing for a few
days ; in the meantime the police b
jury appointed Mr. Hollingsworth a
in place of Mr. Barbee, and the t
clerk of the court, Mr. Hyams, I
appointed Mr. Breazeale, in place t
of Mr. Greneaux on the board of f
Supervisors of election, this caused t
me to take a fresh start on the ,
agreement.
I knew that Messrs. Barbee and a
Greueaux had given us a fair elec- t
tion; I knew them to be good, hon- a
est and upright men, and I did l
not know why the board of Super. a
visors was changed. I immedi- f
ately went to Mr. Cook and had t,
several copies of agreement No. 1 l,
written up. I went to Mr. Porter, g
and after reading same, he told me o
his party would not agree to it, to
and he would not sign it. I was si
not desirous of campaign thunder, e
what I wanted was representatton, tl
so I did not yell the Democrate had I
refused a white election, but I hunt- F
ed up Mr. 8tarborough, and told
him that Mr. Porter said the Dem- u
oerat would not accept the agree- u
met, ad askedd him toplose ee ai
Mr. Porter ad get him to saign it. ii
Mr. Scarborough came back in a v
few mianutes and sail, Mr. Porter I
maid we were violating the law in p
the sixth olause, and wi, trying to a
elect a mamn not quaied as polioei
juror. Well, I was aware of the I
act that the whole thing was a vt h
oatiomo the law. IhandedMr. tl
Suarborough tbhe agreement d l
takId him he wrote the sixth clame a
bimml. He took the agreement,
d iMa remiag brought me the i
- s 3@w3. a
- We tq unselesie hereby **- x
tero I. lhw. a agreee : tg
Sesme -AR was- mhent em
·Cw. Oar se tlui as
. th . C the th- i
i~2 t 'r
I selves to carry it out in subject
and effect.
Fifth-T'he ('ommini'n.ners to he
a:l)pointed Iby both sids are to en
t ter into the spirit of this agree
Siient.
Sixth-The leaders of the two
parties will discountenance any et
fort on the part of the people of
1 any of the wards or the candidates
c for ward officer+, taking any ad
vantage of legal technicalities or
informalities in the election of such
t officers as are to be voted for in
tile ldilfcrent wirdls by the Ipople
t of the wards. This howover, not
_ to be un lerstocd as waving the
requisite for legal qualifications in
a candidate to hold the otlice for
· which he may be voted for.
Seventh-We the undersigned
Scandlldates for office in the parish
of Natchitoches, at the coming
election on the 21st of April, 1896,
I hereby agree to the above and fore
going. and obligate ourselves to
abide by the result.
Eighth-The Commissioners to
be appointed as soon after this
agreement is signed, as possible.
I read it and was satisfied, and
so stated to Mr. Scarbloroough. The
S next morning I saw Mr. Porter,
and told him I was ready for the
agreement, let us sign. lIe said
' he was going to see Mr. Phanor
! Breazeale, and would be back in a
few minutes. When he returned,
the document was revised by put
ting in the words, "and intention"
in the fourth clause. Still I was
t satisfied with the revised edition.
I Mr. Porter and myself immediate
I ly took step to carry out the agree
ment. We went to Red river, min
I front of Mr. Sompayrac's planta
tion to see representatives of our
parties. Mr. II. Raphiel, a Dem
ocrat, came across in a small skiff
an I conferred with Mr. Porter.
I was unable to see any represen
tative of th. Populist party, but
sent the agreement by Mr. R.plih:el
to Messrs. Ilathorn and Lowe,
who were upon the opposite bank.
A few days after this Mr. J. W.
Brown receivd this telegram from
his father: "Does Brian, H nry
and yourself, approve of not let
ting the negroes vote I Is the
measure Populistic ? Answer. To
this Mr. J. W. Brown sent the
following reply : "Pay no atten
tion to that type written docu
ment."
I must say that I tried to per.
suade Mr. Brown not to send the
telegram to his father. However,
Mr. Brown argulst that the Popu
list had offered to the Democrats
a white primary and they ha:l re
fused, and now he was unwilling
to enter into an agreement to vio
late the law, when a chance was
given to the Democrats to carry
out the same ends and not violate
the law. He says he had no de
sire to vote the negro, but he would
enter into no agreement to violate
the law. He further said that the
Democrats expecte t to beat our
Senatorial ticket by voting 2;tv
negroes in DeSoto, and r.s the Pop
ulist were on record as favoring
white supremacy, he would pay no
attention to any measure where he
had to enter into an agreement to
violate the law. I must say, that
I believed Mr. Brown .right in
principle, however, from expedi
emscy, I tried to get Mr. Brown to
sign the agreement. 1 told Mr. -
Brown that be knew that wel
had at least 700 majority with
the white people in this parish,
mad let us receive this majority by !
a fair election. ,
I was afraid of the negro vote.
Mr. Brown and myself had proof -
that-John G. Lewas, the tamous
colored politician, belonged to }he i
Kellogg and Cage faction of the
Bpmblican party, which faction '
am mupportig Foster, and why
g -up a certainty for an uncer
laty t
I wasmr mble to get Mr. Brown
to alga the agreement, so I went
to Iiorm Mr. Porter, although ,
Mr. IBa wa not a mdidlate fmor ia
say .a6c, Mr. Potter wasted (
him to siga, bWean. Mr. Porter e
