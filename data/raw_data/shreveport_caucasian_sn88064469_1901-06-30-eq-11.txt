at week, I preach a sermon of con

at time in the fields and sickles are
hing in the gathering of a great
p. I find mighty suggestiveness in
y text.
It is a picture of a tropical clime, t
ith a season so prosperous that the
rvest reachels clear (ovr to the plant- c
g time and the swarthy husbandman,
usy cutting the grain, almost feels the t
reath of the horses on his shoulders, 1
e horses hitched to the plow prepar- I
for a new crop. "Behold the days
me, salth the Lord. that the plowman
il overtake the reaper." When is
t? That is now. That is this day,
hen hardly have you done reaping
ne harvest of religious result than the
plowman is getting ready for another.
In phraseology charged with all ven
om and abuse and caricature I know
that infidels and agnostics have de
clared that Christianity has collapsed;
that the Bible is an obsolete book; that
the Christian church is on the retreat.
I shall answer that wholesale charge
today.
Between 3,000,000 and 4.000,000 En
deavorers sworn before high heaven
that they will do all they can to take
America for God, Europe for God, Asia
and Africa for God-are not the signs
most cheering? Or, to return to the
agricultural figure of my text, more
than a million reapers are overtaken
by more than a million plowmen. Be
sides this, there are more people who
believe in the Bible than at any time
A. 0i wqrld's existence.

But now let us see whether the book
Is a last year's almanac. Let us see
whether the church of God Is a Bull
Bun retreat, muskets, canteens and
haversacks strewing all the way. The

th my friends, infidelity Is not half so

in- A distinguished infidel years ago,

of "What has Christianity ever done?'

I Tbe Ch.re. Advaelning. h
Here these infidel scientists have Im- th
paneled themselves as a jury to decide he
this trial between Infidelity, the plain
tiff, and Christianity, the defendant,
and after being out for centuries they
come in to render their verdict. Gen
tlemen of the jury, have you agreed on
a verdict? No, no. Then go back for an
another 500 years and deliberate and pa
agree on something. There is not a D
poor, miserable wretch in the city pris- th
on tomorrow that could be condemned ne
by a jury that did not agree on the ver. n
dict. and yet you expect us to give up a
our glorious Christianity to please s
these men who cannot agree on any
thing. Ah. my friends, the church of C
Jesus Christ, instead of falling back, is W
on the advance. a
I am mightily encouraged because I1
find, among other things, that while 9
this Christianity has been bombarded 80
for centuries infidelity has not destroy- e
ed one church or crippled one minister di
or uprooted one verse of one chapter of i
all the Bible. If that has been their
magnificent record for the centuries of k
the past, what may we expect for the i
future? The church all the time get- t
ting the victory, and their shot and d
shell all gone.
And then I find another most encour- a
aging thought in the fact that the sec- tl
I ular printing press and the pulpit seem a
harnessed in the same team for the ii
'proclamation of the gospel. Every 0
i banker in this capital tomorrow, every I
Wall street banker tomorrow in New a
York, every State street banker tomor- t
row in Boston, every Third street bank- 1
er tomorrow in Philadelphia, every t
a banker in the United States and every c
s merchant will have in his pocket a c
f treatise on Christianity, 10, 20 or 30 t
i passages of Scripture in the reports of a
sermons preached throughout the land I
today. It will be so in Chicago, so in a
New Orleans, so in Charleston, so in
Boston, so in Philadelphia, so in Cin
einnati, so everywhere. I know the a
s tract societies are doing a grand and 1
glorious work, but I tell you there is
no power on earth today equal to the 1
z fact that the Amerktan printing press I
h is taking up the sermons which are I
Lt preached to a few hundred or a few
h thousand people and on Monday morn
Saing and Monday evening scattering I
ithat truth to the millions. What an en

You say morphia puts one to sleep.
You say in time of sickness it is very
useful. I deny it. Morphia never puts
r anybody to sleep. It never alleviates
pain. You ask why I say that. I have
never tried it. I never took it. I deny
that morphia is any soothing to the
nerves or any quiet in times of sick
ness. I deny that morphia ever put O0
p anybody to sleep. But here are 20 per
L sons who say they have all felt the
soothing effects of a physician's pre
t scribing morphine. Whose testimony
* will you take? Those who took the
medicine or my testimony, I never hav
1 ing taken the medicine. Here is the
e gospel of Jesus Christ. an anodyne for
d all trouble, the mightiest medicine on
. earth. Here is a man who says: "I
r don't believe in it. There is no power 0
f in it" Here are other people who say:
ir "We have found out its power and
if know its soothing influence. It has
e cured us." Whose testimony will you

Young man, do not be ashamed to be
r- a friend of the Bible. Do not put your
c thLmb in your vest, as young men
in sometimes do, and swagger about, talk- Pl
1e ing of the glorious light of nature and
*y of there being no need of the Bible. Hg
-y They have the light of nature in India
w and China and in all the dark places of
r- the earth. Did you ever hear that the
k- light of nature gave them comfort for
ry their troubles? They have lancets to
ry cut and Juggernauts to crush, but no
a comfort. Ah, my friends, you had bet
30 ter stop your skepticism! Suppose you
of are put in a crisis like that of Colonel
ad Ethan Allen. I saw the account and
in at one time mentioned it in an address.
in A descendant of Ethan Allen, who is ý"
in- an infidel, said it never occurred. Soon
he after I received a letter from a pro
ad fessor in one of our colleges, who is ti
is also a descendant of Ethan Allen and u
he is a Christian. He wrote me that the 01
us incident is accurate; that my state- t
Lre ment was authentic and true. The a
ew wife of Colonel Etnan Allen was a very
rn- consecrated woman. The mother in- o
ng structed the daughter in the truths of
an- Christianity. The daughter sickened
Ln! and was about to die, and she said to
her father: "Father, shall I take your
1g. instruction, or shall I take mother's
Ith instruction? I am going to die now.
ire I must have this matter decided." That
hi- man, who had been loud in his infidell- I
iey ty, said to his dying daughter, "My
ing dear, you had better take your mother's
the religion." My advice is the same to I
ere you. O young man! You know how re
led ligion comforted her; you know what
uld she said to you when she was dying.
av- You had better take your mother's re
hat ligion.
