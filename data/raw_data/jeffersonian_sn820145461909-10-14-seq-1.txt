OLD SUBSIDY FIGHT ON AGAIN.
It is encouraging to see the prompt
renewal of the fight on the ship sub
sidy proposition since President Taft
has lined up with the advocates of
that deathless and determined band
of raiders of the National Treasury.
Defeat does not seem to dampen the
ardor of the American shipbuilders,
for no sooner has one effort failed
than they renew it with undimin
ished vigor and persistence.
No one contends that subsidies
would reduce rates on freight. They
would not. The whole truth is that
the subsidy would go exclusively to
the owners, whose only excuse for
asking for government aid is that it
would make up to them the amount
they would lose in the business if un
aided. The shipper need expect no
lower rates, for the government is
not to aid, but to indemnify the own
ers. The New York Journal of Com
merce very strongly points out that
the shipper can hardly hope for addi
tional shipping facilities, for the sea
carrving trade is almost always over
done, profits and wages at sea are
generally low, idle shipping is tied
up in nearly every port, and the ex
isting companies are only too eager
to get cargoes for any destination
and to increase their service at the
least prospect of an increased de
mand.
In regard to the display of the
American flag, it hardly needs to be
said that it matters not to the goods
under what flag they are exported.
The writer of a recent article in the
Atlantic Monthly, whose name is not
given, but who is described as an offi
cer in the British naval reserve and
merchant marine, assumes that for
eign shipping companies will inevi
tably discriminate against American
business.*
Why, then, asks our New York con
temporary, are so many foreign
steamship companies established in
American ports, how does it happen
that for years after the close of the
Boer war British steamship lines
were making lower freight rates
from New York than from London,
and how does it happen that, with
a declining over-sea shipping, our
export trade has grown so enormous
ly? If, as a matter of sentiment, or
advertising, it be desired to have the
American flag displayed in foreign
ports the way is easy; permit Amer
ican owners to put their flags on
their own property. It is not certain
whether they wish to or not; but the
Commissioner of Navigation has re
ported that there is some 600,000
tons of shipping owned by Ameri
cans, which is sailed under foreign
flags. If any considerable fraction
of these owners availed themselves

Jeffersonian Club News-
* ,
Our desk is piled up with letters
from people who want to organize
clubs, and want to know how to go
to work, or have some suggestions
to offer as to the best way.
There is but one reply to all —
ORGANIZE. It doesn’t matter how
you do it, or where you do it, or how
many there are, or how few—OR
GANIZE.
You don’t need a brass band and
a silver-tongued orator. You need
MEN—that’s all.
Six men can form a club. One can
be president and one secretary, and
all six can work.
As soon as organized in this tem
porary fashion, map out the country
around you into sections, and let
each man take one section to work
in.
At the end of two weeks have an
other meeting. By that time each
member will have gathered in a few
new members. You can then adopt a
simple set of by-laws and a simple
working platform.
The next thing is to arrange for a
public meeting; get some local
speakers interested; have a debate;
advertise it in your local papers; let
all the people around you know
what the club stands for, and what
Jeffersonian Democracy means, and
bow the word REFORM is spelled.
Report all your proceedings to the
Jeffersonian, and we will help you to
get a good start.
It won’t be long before we shall
have a State organization, which
will put us on a firmer footing.
Each member pledges himself to
work along broad lines of reform.
He is not bound to any party ma
chinery or bosses. He is inde
pendent—A MAN.
Each club is pledged, through its
members, to work for reform, civic,
State and national. Each club pre
serves its independence; it is a col
lection of independent MEN.
of the permission to put their flag
over their own vessels quite a be
ginning would be made in the way
of displaying the American flag in
the ports of the world. The ship
builders would pretest against this.
They would be almost the sole bene
ficiaries of a subsidy. The granting
of a subsidy to American-built steam
ers would not lower freight rates; it
would increase sailings from our
ports little if at all; it would have
no appreciable influence upon our ex
port trade, which has grown enor-
Each State organization will be
pledged, through its clubs, to carry
on active work of reform, but this
work will be inaugurated by the in
dependent clubs and must be always
subject to their decision by vote.
The national organization will be
made by the union of the indepen
dent State organizations, which have
been formed out of the independent
clubs, and these, at the beginning,
were composed of a few independent
men.
The national organization of Jef
fersonian clubs will be the PEOPLE
ORGANIZED.
The voice of this national organ
ization will be the VOICE OF THE
PEOPLE.
At one end of the chain you have
a man who stands for reform and is
able and willing to work for it. At
the other end you have THE PEO
PLE who vote.
The plan is as simple as the build
ing of a wall by adding one brick to
another.
Now, go and get the bricks.
We have heard it suggested that
the organization started by Mr. Will
IT. Stanford, of Oxford, Ga., will be
a, rival of the Jeffersonian Clubs.
Never was there a greater mistake.
The Young Men’s League, which Mr.
Stanford is working for, will, we
hope, always be an auxiliary and
partner of the Jeffersonian Clubs,
and in every place where a club is
organized we hope to see the Young
Men’s League working side by side
with the older folks. We need the
young men of the country, with their
enthusiasms and high hopes; and
whenever and wherever they come,
they will receive a hearty welcome
among the ranks of the reformers.
Make way for the Young Men’s
League.

Practically all the subsidy would go
into the shipyards.—Richmond Ev

WHAT IS THE MOST PERFECT
POPULAR GOVERNMENT.
About 547 years before Christ, Pe
riander, one of the wise men of
Greece, wrote a circular letter to all
the wise men, inviting them to pass
some time with him at Corinth, as
they had done the year before at
Sardis, with Croesus. The simplici-
ty of the entertainment was charac
teristic of the company assembled,
for it was more of a feast of mind
and reason than of rich and delicate
viands.
The subject of their discourse at
the table on one occasion was:
“Which is the most perfect popular
government?”
The answer of each was as follows;
Solon—“ That, where an injury
done to any private citizen is such to
the whole body.”
Bias—“ That, where the law has no
superior.”
Thales—“ That, where the inhab
itants are neither too rich nor too
poor.”
Anacharsis—“That, where virtue
is honored and vice detested.”
Pittacus —“Where dignities are al
ways conferred upon the virtuous and
never upon the wicked.”
Cleobulus —“Where the citizens
fear blame more than punishment.”
Chilo—“Where the laws are more
regarded and have more authority
than the orators.”
From all these opinions Periander
concluded, that the most perfect pop
ular government would be that
which came nearest to aristocracy,
where the sovereign authority is
lodged in the hands of a few men of
honour and virtue.

HOW TO SEE EUROPE.
Germany.
It is not compulsory to drink beer
in Germany. The drinking of water
and other peculiar liquids is permit
ted. If you desire water with your
meals you should telegraph ahead to
the next hotel and give the proprie
tor time to hunt up a well.
German courtesy should be studied
and followed as much as possible.
Germans are always courteous, no
matter what they are doing to you.
This does not include the women
clerks in Germany, who are not po
lite to anybody. Always use the
word “Bitte” (please) to begin and
end every sentence. Everyone does.
The German policeman requests you
to “please” come with him, and the
horns of German automobiles are
made to imitate the word as closely
as possible. At your hotel you will
frequently be pained to notice that
your waiter pays no attention to the
word, and does not serve you any
faster than he would otherwise. This
is simply because he does not under
stand your accent. The proper ac
cent to put on the word “bitte” in
German hotels is a one mark pieo z '
at tl e end of the last syllable. 1
