Sam Jocnes says
II has been a Democrat-as good
one as anyxodly. To prove his
loyalty and that he was all right
with the democracy, sait he went
home drunk every night when he
was one,
That a "pop" is something that
has done bulsted. Correct--lasted
both old parties, and busted p irty
lines.
That he can tell a Detmocrat by
the color of his nose. It is from
;t pale pink to a bIdl ret.
That there is not an ang l in
heaven knows who was elected at,
the April election in this State.
That as soon as a on couts I.mse
in politics fr,:u the "old gang"
lle is at one dnouancwd by them as
a scoundrel.
That to be a tepublican requirei
the swallowing of the "niggoer;"
to be a Democrat the swallowing
oat a barrel of whiskey, andl his
choice would be the "nigger."
Usury is the sting-the sharp
dagger point, of the power of mon
ey to oppres. It is the impelling
force in all the conquests of the
purse; adl in all the mircles of
money. It is the power behind
the missile in the tbrot of the
great fSnancial gun that operates
ta distasicn It is thecarbin and
the sword's edge of the fimadi
engdgemaent; and the merciless
bayonet charge which routs poor
men from their homes, turning
them and their families loo'e on so
ciety as Imtrdeusome and (danger
ous tramps, No reformation on
our money system can be com
plete and urrmmaent while usury
is not destryoyor This theory is
not new. It in ok s hiLstory alnd
true as holy writ; verifkied by the
experiences of mankind and the
deIlkctiobns of kgic.--Jobn Davis.
