We give below the article in full
taken from the New Orleans Bulletlin,
one of the ablest defenders of the peo
ple, and commend it to a careful peru
sal by our readers. It speaks truth
which must prevail. We have de
juonstrated a principle, and do not
propose to throw away results in such
a really at this time, foolish, imbecile
compromise. We would like the Bull
ltin. to find out and let the people
know who is the gentlemanly statesman
that now comes forward with this
weak decoction for the sick patient.
Everything is agai~st its acceptance,
holor, duly and principle, and what
else in God's name do we desire to
live for:
The air is rife with rumors of cor
promise with the usurpation just com
lletely overthrown by this people.
God knows we would be the last in
this community to wantonly throw an
obstacle in the way of honorable and
satisfactory solution of our troubles.
On the contrary, all considerations are
with us subordinate to this, and we
will go as far as any plnan, inside the
pale of principle and even intelligent
expediency, to accomplish it.
But we must raise our humble voice
against this thing called compromise,
in the emergency that is upon us. It
is simply impossible that it can be
right for this people to be so wholly
selfish as to bite at the luring, bait of
compromise. We can not, if we
would, divest ourselves of the fact
that the emergency that is on as in
volves a stupendous political princi
ile which, if ignored, while we catch
at a nmmnentary promise of relief, will
stand forever lacerated and crippled
before us, and will haunt us, while
we live, and our children after us.
The contest of Monday was made
on principle. We are civilized men,
and were born freemen. That con
test was made on this basis. We
were under a despotism, and we shook
it off as did our forefathers, who. be
queathed us the right and the man
hood to do it. The blood that stained
the streets that day on our side was
consecrated to ever-living principle
not to shifting compromise and poli
tical barter. We never could have
drawa our people out to fight for the
best gilded compromise that ever emanat
ed fromn political caucus. But when
they were pointed to the hearthstones
impoverished and sorrow-stricken,
and to the first and dearest of human
rights utterly. trampled; when they
were told that all appeals to consti
tuted authority were exhausted, and
that no relief had come, then did the
strife begin, and the punishment was
quick and complete.
But is compromise expedient ! No,
no, not for one moment. What have
we donet Nothing less than proven
to the world that the Kellogg usurpa
tion had no foundation whatever in
the hearts of this people, white or
black; that it existed only perforce
of hired bayonets, and that it went
down under the first shock of arms.
We assembled unarmed in the broad
day-time; sent him word we were
going to fight ; went home and put
on our arms; came back to the open
streets and ran him out of the State
to his only reliable support, the Cus
tom-House. Thence he cried aloud
for Federal bayonets, and they have
cbme to reinstate him.
Who, then, are we to treat with ?
With the corrupt and cowardly Cus
tom-House crew, who never raised a
finger to sustain tbe government they
have for two years proclaimed legi
timate Never, never! They and
their chief, Kellogg, can only govern
Louisiana by force of Federal bayonets
and, if the Federal Administration
can carry this burden before the Ame
rican people, let them do it. If they
can, then is the form of government
of the United Stateschauged, and the
sooner it is known the better for all
parties. It ivill be a crime for us to
do anything that can while giving us
a trivial temporary relief (which we
only admit for the sake of argument),
will deceive a whole people (oereelves
included), into fixed depotism. No,
let the Government at Washington
carry the full'burden of this present
annihilation of the only government
in Louisiana. Sooner or later it will
* crush them,'iinl we'will be better off
in the end; It is not the Custom
House, but WasMatoi. that ieets a
compromise. Let us stand by o.r
colors.

Louisiana.
The St. Louis Dispatch, if not the
most prominent, still the ablest and
most brilliant journal in the West,
publishes the following editorial on
the situation in Louisiana. The ar
ticle shows a perfect acquaintance
with the feelings of our people and a
perfectly clear apprehension of the
results that will flow from Federal in
erference in our affairs. We pub
ish the article of the Dispatch and
endorse it as if it were our own ut
terance :
Robbed, tortured and abused as no
people have ever been since the be
ginning of christianuity, the Louisian
iians have risen at last in revolt, seized
the capital of their State, forced the
armed guards of the satrap Kellogg
to surrender, and driven the Governor,
and his commander-in-chief, Long
street, to the shelter of the Federal
guns at the custom-house.
Of course the end is not yet. The
pretext so long labored for and cuu
ningly sought to be made acceptable
to the North, has come at last and
Louisiana will be inundated anew
with* United States soldiers. Then
what? We verily'believe there will
come out of this ominous beginning
war by lake 'add lagoon--the war of
the bayou and the swamp, the marsh
and the canebrake--that slow, pa
tient, inexorable, merciless guerrilla
war which poisons everything that it
touches, which is constantly being
extirpated, and yet which never dies
or loses aught of its savage despera
tion and ferocity. Tlhat time has
come in Louisiana when it will be
profitable to go to war-when it will
be mercy to win or lose by a quick,
sharp stroke, rather than to die by
inches and under the blows of their
plunderers and their masters.
We think we understand the full
meaning of the uprising. As long as
it is possible the State troops will
keep from conflict with the Federal
troops. An appeal will be directed to
the nation in behalf of the right of an
outraged people to saie their proper
ty and protect theiq wives and chil
dren from actual want. This will fall
upon cold and unheeding ears. Grant
will support Kellogg. Troops enough
to hold New Orleans will be sent to
New Orleans. There will be a milita
ry government established in the
State just as Austria established one
in Italy by holding the large towns
and fortifying them,just as the French
did in Mexico by governing the cities.
Outside of these forts, however, the
guerrilla warfare will be incessant.
The State troops will light the Fed
eral troops-be sure of that-and no
power on earth can prevent it now
but the President. Up to a certain
point, %ne United States flag and fif
ty men in blue might march anywhere
in the ounth, camp anywhere, receive
respect and kind treatment every
where; but beyond, a certain point
the praent regular army of the gov
ernment is not sufficient to hold even
Louisiqla in subjection. Fifty Mo
does Ield their own for months
against ten thousand soldiers; it took
four or five regiments of cavalry and
as many of infantry to keep Quan
trell and his fifty men out of St. Louis.
-Bill Anderson roamed at will, kil
ling and defying a State full of regulars
and militia. Won't it be fearful when
instead of one Quantrell in Louis
iana, there are fifty; instead of one
Anderson, each parish has a leader
just as savage and just as enterpri
sing 9 Bul in the end say those who
reason about it, the Government will
triumph and the guerrillas will go to
the wall. Unquestionably, but this
is one of those things about which
the Louisianians will not reason. They
say and say truthfully that we have
endured everyfthing, suffered every
thing, been robbed of everything, the
jumping-off place has come, and while
sight is yet left to us, we will lay hold
of the columns that support the tem
ple and bury everything in a common
ruin. For months and months the
people of Lonisiana have been pitiful
to their appeals. If they were read
at all, they were as speedily forgot
ten. Tgey have described their suf
ferings, recounted thieir wrongs, plead
ed for bare justice, asked to have a
little left to them, got on their knees
to their tMik-masters, and now human
nature has revolted. This is all. In
the North the conflict, under similar
provocation, would have been simul
taneous with the offense. It is not an
emeaite, a hasty and passionate blow,
a sadden spasm of resistance; but it
is the calm and deliberate purpose of
brave men who ha$ve fully organized
themselves and who mean to fight
Sthe devil with fire. May Heaven pro
lesthpgand send to them a speedy

Natchitoches, Sept. 10th,1874.
Sept. 12-3t.
Platform of the White People's
Party.
We, the white people of Louisiana, enm
bracing the Democratic Party, the Con
servative Party, the White Man's Party,
the Liberal Party, the Reform Party and
all others opposed to the Kellogg usur
pation do solemnly resolve and declare :
I. That the government now existing
in Louisiana originated in, and has been
maintained by force and fraud, in oppo
sition to the will of a large mnajority of
the voters of the State ; in opposition to
the principles of the Constitution of tlhe
United States and in violation of every
principle of justice and liberty.
2 That the dominlant faotion of the
Radical party in this State has, Iby false
antd fraudulent represeutations, inflaumed
the passions and lprejudiees of the ne
groes, as a race, agaiust the whites, and
has thereby nmade it necessary for the,
white people to unite and act together inl
self-defense and the preservation of white
civilization.
3. That the rights of all men under the
Constitution and laws of the land must
be respected and preserved inviolate, il
respective of race, color or previous con
dition, but we deny that Congress can
Constitutionally enact laws to force the
two races into social union or equality.
4. That the white people of Louisiana
have no desire to deprive the colored
people of any rights to which they are en
titled, but we are convinced that the re
forms imlporatively demanded, can be
effected only by electing to otlice white
men of known capacity and integrity,
and we believe that large numbeirs of
colored citizens will vote with us to se
cure a government which must be bene
fidial alike to both races.
5. That we disclaim earnestly any in
tention of carrying, or attempting to car
ry, the approaching election by violence,
and that charges to this effect emanating
from our Radical enemies, are without
foundation and are falsely made for the
purpose of obtaningin the aid of the ntil
itary force of the United States in order
to over-awe the people, perpetuate the
existing usurpation and subvert the true
principles of the government.
6. That W. P. Kellogg is a mere usurp
er and we denounce him as such, that his
government is arbitrary, unjust and op
pressive; and that it can maintain it
self only through Federal interferenee.
7. That the election and registration
laws under which this election is being
conducted were intetded to perpetuate
the usurpation by depriving the people
and especially our naturalized citizens of
an opportunity to register and vote, but
we announce, distinctly, that it is the
determination of the people to have a
fair and free election and to see that the
result is not changed by fraud or violence.
8. That we extend to all our race in
every clime the right hand of fellowship
and a cordial invitation to come and set
tle among us, and unite their destinies
with ours.
9. That while we are in favor of meet
ing punctually the payment of the legit
imate debt of Louisiana, we are inmeo
vably opposed to the recognitions issued
in the name of the State, aunt we pledge
ourselves to make a searching investiga
tion in the matter.
We advise our people to vote against
theeamendm ents to the Constitution pro
posed by the usurping Legislature and
pledge ourselves on the restoration of the
government to honest hands, to provide
for the payment of all honest indebted
uess of the State.
TIIE DUTY OF SUPERVISORS.--The
Democratic and Conservative Super
visors of Registration have important

1. They must be present at the
opening and closing of the office, and
be certain to check off the last regist

dition in the night time.
2. They nmust keep a list of all the
registered voters as fast as they are

The Saturday Evening Post.
The Oldest and Best Story Paper Pub
lished.
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever borne a
widespread and unblemished rleputation
for the unsnrpassed purity, refinement
and excellence of the Scrials, Sketches
and Miscellaneous reading matter.
It is pre-eminently
Tlihe Best Family Paper
that is published in this country, from its
never containing anything that would
offend the feelings of any one, either in
as religious or political sense, or that
could not be read at any fireside without
oljcction front the most fastidious.
The circulation of the Saturday Even
ing Post, through not quite so large
perhaps, as its younger contemporaries,
is not, like that of some of them, fluctu
ating, and too often short-lived, but
SUIjE, SOLID AND SUBSTANTLIL,
based upon the intrinsic merit of the pa
per itself, and not dependent on any ex
traneous influences, such as the popiilari
ty of individual writers, &c.
Good, however, as the Salturday Even
ing Post has been in the past, it is our
intention to make it still better in the
future, and with this object in view we
will effect a marked improvement in eve
ry department of the paper, and will
call to our assistance w'riters of admitted
ability and known reputation.
By increasing its fornmer attractions,
and adding many judicious and pleas
ing novelties, by studying how to please
and cultivate the popular taste, by in
creasing industry and enterprise, and by
enlarged faeilities, we hope to make new
friends with each and every issue, and
continue to maintain the claim of the
Saturday Evening Post to its title of Tinl
OLDES'r AND THE BEST of Family Story
Papers.
