RESOLUTIONS BY CROW’S MILL
UNION 448.
Crow’s Hill Union, 448, has re
solved :
Whereas, Brother B. F. Ward, Jr.,
editor of the Union Advocate, of
Jackson, Miss., saw fit to take Thos.
E. Watson, editor of The Jefferson
ian, to task for exposing some of the
officials of the Farmers Union; and
Whereas, they have failed to meet
him in the open; and
Whereas, Thomas E. Watson has
not attacked the Union nor any offi
cial of Mississippi;
Therefore we condemn such mis
representation, demonstration and
editorials of B. F. Ward.
Resolved, As we have been be
trayed so often in the past, we are
glad to have a friend in Thomas E.
Watson, who will keep us informed.
And whereas, B. F. Ward’s last
tirade was borrowed from Walt Ma
son, we, who pay our dues, condemn
such methods.
Resolved that a copy of these reso
lutions be sent to the Advocate and
to The Jeffersonian for publication.
Done in session this 20th day of
March, 1910.

RESOLUTIONS FROM BOWMAN
LOCAL 1135.
Whereas, one of our recent mem
bers, Bro. J. J. Brown, who holds a
demit from Bowman Local No. 1135,
good until April 1, 1910, has been
unjustly treated by State President
J. L. Lee, by letters sent out to be
read behind closed doors and that are
calculated to mislead the member
ship throughout the State; and
Whereas, we know Bro. J. J.
Brown to be a man who has at all
times stood for the best interest of
the masses of the people, and has
made great personal sacrifices in the
interest of the agricultural organiza
tions of our State; therefore we dis
approve of the action of Bro. Lee in
this matter, and commend Bro. J. J.
Brown to the members of our noble
Order as one whose loyalty is beyond
question and whose past effort and
unselfish work for the agricultural
people will be felt for years to come.
Resolved further, Whereas, we
wish to exonerate Bro. J. J. Brown
of the charges brought against him
(for acting as guano agent while be
ing a member of our Union) by
President J. L. Lee;
Resolved further, That we send a
copy of these resolutions to Watson’s
Jeffersonian, to the Union News, to
the Royston Record and Elberton
Star for publication.
Done in open meeting by Bowman
Local No. 1135, this March 19, 1910.

A MEMORIAL FROM HILL COUN
TY FARMERS’ UNION.
Hillsboro, Texas.
To R. A. McDuff, President and Dele
gates of the Hill County Farmers’
Union now in session.
We, your Committee on Resolu
tions, beg to submit the following;
Whereas, we believe that the
freight rate on cotton is a great
deal higher than is paid on other
commodities, and that the farmers
of Texas are losing vast sums of
money annually which should go in
to their pockets if rates on cotton
were established in accordance with
other articles; therefore be it
Resolved, That we recommend the
Farmers’ Union of Texas, through
their officials, The Farm and Ranch,
Hatton W. Summers, and other
available source, to continue their
fight on the reduction of freight
rates on cotton until a just and
equitable rate is secured. We be
lieve that cottonseed should pay its
just and proportionate part of freight
rates —no more and no less. We,
the Hill County Union, now in con
vention assembled, endorse the ac
tion of the Farm and Ranch, Hatton
W. Summers, and our State presi
dent, in their fight for the reduction
of freight on cotton, and hereby
lend our endorsement to them so
long as they continue the fight on
present lines.
Resolved further, That we oppose
the plan adopted, as shown from the
papers, by D. J. Neal, editor of the
Co-Operator, in entering into a com
promise with the railroads for the
Union to quit the fight for reduction
of freight rates on cotton.
Resolved further, We believe that
the present rate on cottonseed is
sufficiently high, and that the pres
ent rate on cottonseed should remain
as it is.
Respectfully submitted.

Unanimously adopted.

Hillsboro, Texas.
WIFE’S AWAY, THIS MAN TALKS.
Dear Sir:—You seem to be attack
ing evil wherever you find it, and I
glory in your spunk. Among many
others, I see you are jumping on the
Co-Operator. I would not like for
my wife to hear me mention the Co-
Operator, but as she is not here to
night I will write about it.
D. J. Neal and the Co-Operator
seem to be about the same caliber, so
—as my wife is gone—l may have
something to say about both.
About two years ago O. P. Pyle
owned the Co-Operator, and it had a
good circulation and the Union peo
ple liked it —all but D. J. N.—it
seems that he did not like the paper
or the editor of it. So he (D. J.)
sent out a circular letter to the Un
ion people, stating that he did not
like the Co-Operator, and that the
Texas State Union was going to pub
lish a paper, the name of which
would be “The Union Farmer.” In
that circular he requested the Union
people to subscribe, with the under-
Gbe
standing that they were were to take
the paper (The Union Farmer) for
six months. At the end of that time
if-they liked The Union Farmer they
were to pay for it at the rate of $1
a year. If they did not like The Un
ion Farmer, they would not owe any
thing for the six months*«Hiat they
had received it.
Well, nearly all of my Local sub
scribed for it, and no doubt several
thousand others did the same thing.
Any way, Neal got enough subscrip
tions to scare Pyle out of the Co.
Operator business.
Well, the next thing that we heard
Neal and Pyle had had a fight, and
Smith and Sweet had bought the Co-
Operator and would edit the same.
The State Executive Committee was
to have complete control at all times
of the editorial department, and the
State Union was to have a certain
per cent of the profit derived from
the same, and it was to be the offi
cial organ of the State Union. The
Union people still liked the Co-
Operator. Some time, or some how,
the Co-Operator has slipped out of
the hands of Smith & Sweet, slipped
out of the control of the State Ex
ecutive Committee, ceased to be the
official organ of the State Union, and
slipped into the hands of, we un
derstand, an lowa Republican and
millionaire by the name of C. D.
Riemers, with D. J. as editor, and
stands for a ship subsidy. And the
Union people are falling out with it.
This is a brief history of D. J. and
the Co-Operator fpr the last two or
three years.
Very truly,
J. N. HAMILTON.
Bowie, Texas, Rt. 3.
TO THE FARMERS’ UNION MEN
OF GEORGIA.
Men and Brethren: —Do you real
ize that we are ruled by the methods
of all ring politicians? How many of '
you that read this article were in
Macon at the State Convention in
1908?
Do you remember the trick that
John Lee and his backers tried to
w r ork? You know that they tried to
railroad a scheme through that con
vention that was a disgrace to such
an organisation as ours.
Trying to elect all old officers by
acclamation, thereby shutting out all
opposition.
Did you know the fact that they
sent a spy to the caucus meeting of
the opposition under an assumed
name?
That the said spy reported the
secrets of the meeting to J. L. Lee
and the other old line leaders, and
that the said Lee and the other mis
leaders held a caucus meeting from
then until nearly day?
John Lee told me the next morn
ing (on the corner of Fourth and
Poplar streets) that he was going to
the City Auditorium to save the Un
ion of Georgia, or kill it.
If that was not a rule or ruin
policy, pray tell me what it was?
John and Duckworth meant to
hold their positions or kill the Union.
And they used methods that no
gentleman would have used to ac
complish their purpose.
They had their partisans lined up

almost to a man, and you could see
couriers carrying written orders from
the rostrum as to how to vote.
Such was a part of the scenes on
the floor of the State Convention of
the Farmers’ Union in 1908.
All honor to Hon. J. Pope Brown,
Bros. Hunnicutt and L. W. Jarman,
of Porterdale, and others, who led
the fight against such crooked meth
ods. I know that they were classed
as the Lon Livingston crowd. I know
that when Hon. Pope Brown mount
ed the rostrum and declared (in a
passionate plea for peace) that he
had heard nothing said against the
old officers, a report went the rounds
that he had made a speech in the
caucus meeting (in which the spy
took part), declaring that Duck
worth must be knifed, or his hands
tied with a new executive committee.
If you believed those reports then,
would you believe them now, after
Mr. Watson has'shown you how rot
ten your officers are, and after John
Lee changed the report of the con
ference that went down on him?
John thinks that he is a heavenly
bush set in a tub of glory, and you
must not even look displeased, or he
will annul your charter. He thinks
that he will hold down the member
ship, which he may do, but he can
