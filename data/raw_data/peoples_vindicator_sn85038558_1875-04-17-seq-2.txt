"A Democrat."(?)
The endeavor to take in the gnulla
ble with the letter signed "A Demo
crat," in the Natchitoches Republican
of last week, is too transp.rent to de
ceive the most stupid. In the first
pl that individual's Democracy
mW: ve been of the weakest sort
to e been turned to Radicalism
for so small a cause; we assert that
opportunity was all that gentleman(T)
required, and are of the impression
he is one of the "several" who would
have joined the Republican party
last year, had not the people made it
rather to warm at that time for a dis
play of mandlin demagogism.
All this talk of men of prineiple re
cantin, their Democracy, is the veri
est twaddle. At this moment poor
Louisiana is laboring under, not only
the ills of a thieving government, but
she has to support the presence of a
lot of rotten office hunters of the
"silent order," who although ostensi
bly with the people, are still their
worst enemies. The true men are
making a note of these reptiles;. they
are welt known, and in future, not
'withstanding their protestations and
seeming seal, they will be placed
where they belong.
To the -clause of "A Democrat's"
naamning the leaders who have "form
ed a ring," or are engaged in some
dark and mysterious movement; we
defy him to do so; dare is a more
proper expression, and we await with
trembling and painful anxiety, the
result of his squib.
We have seen some artillery in our
life, but if this "piece" is Dot of the
smallest calibre we have seen to no
purpose. Every Radical who is
ashamed to own his allegiance to his
party, and who desires to preserve his
respectability here, loudly proclaims
the fact of his being "a Democrat,"
but the cant is too old to wash. The
lion's skin does not cover the ass.
We desire to inform that class of
individuals, that their presence in
the ranks of the Democracy will be
dispensed with in thoe'nture, for their
services are of such questionable
utility as to make it a matter of no
moment to us where they are.
The Republican (Natchitoches) of
last week gravely informs its seven
readers that the "era of plunder is
now over" in the State, which we take
as a fatal admission for that delecta
ble sheet. For reform to be inaugn
rated and an era of plunder to cease
with the individuals represented by
that paper, some terrible thieving
"we know not of" must have been
done, for in all our efforts to expose
the villainy of the Radicals here, the
Republican remained sublimely si
lent, or charged upon oar party in
timidation and outrage.
Boullt and Myers meet with no
sympathy, publicly, from the Radl
cals, and E. L. Pierson has done one
good thing, for which all the virtue
must, however, be accorded to pub
Slie opinion, in instituting suit against
Myers for an embezlement of the
Sschool fund. At least we have Pier
son's word therefor although we have
as yet never seen the suit; now the
Reputblican comes to the front and
Simparts the startling intelligence to
its party, that they have plunoodered
in the past but most now cease to
- do so, at least sdch is the inference,
Iand with this admission it starts out
on a begging tour for recruit. to its
ranks. We are of the opinion that
virtoous people will require some
I thing more in the way of a pledge
than a simple promise from the thiev
ing party in power in Louisiana for
future virtue; and a promise of loot
would be more acceptable to the
spoil hunters, if that clas s desired.
How strange is all this, that party
seal should blind the sterling patri
ots of the Republik'an to the fact that
the BRadicals were plundering as for
so long a time, and even now we fear
they jest, else some terrible malady
has over taken them and they have
turned saint beeause sick.
We venture the assertion that no
Sountry is so bl.eed with people who
are so eery anxious to serve their
country (for pay) as this. Every
shift in tihe political wind that fills a
hitherto flapping sail, brings to the
esurface some hidden Hampden, ready
to sacrifice himself oo the alter of his
Sceountry (for spoils.) These individ
nals may not be large in numbers,
but tihe potency of their seal and the
Sindustry of their professions, make
up for all other qualities they may be
sadly in need of.
SWe are led to these reflections sim
Sply from a desire to call the attention
Sof the public to the fact, that in fu
toure in our casting about for public
Sservants, we may not overlook the
claims of these gentlemen(f). The
persistency with which they have
dinned the public ear with their
claims, are so8uicent to entitle them
to at least a hearing. They are nev
I ertheless of that:clanes who,
"All would be deem'd, e'eni from the cra

Sale of Currency for City Script.
The second sale of currency under
the new city regulation took place at
the Mayor's office on Saturday last,
April 10th, in the presence of a num
ber of persons; the bidding was
quite spirited, and the sum realized
to the city by the sale quite satisfac
tory.
We cannot refrain from compli
menting our worthy Mayor, DeoVar
gas, for his endeavors to place the
funds of the city upon a proper foot
inug; the stealage of $4,300, by Red
mond, the Radical city collector in
1874, from a $5000 levy, made the
task of getting our local government
even once more, almost hopeless;
but by wise measures and judicious
management, nearly $2000 over and
above the assessment have already
been absorbed.
The salaries of officers have been
reduced and all expenses curtailed,
and one more year of this adnminis
tration will place us on a firm footing.
The following is the schedule of
the sale :

Now that we have become settled
in politics for more than a year to
come, much can be done by our citi
zens torl4ance the interest of them
selves and the country; to put us on
our feet more firmly, both materially
and politically.
Much is required to be done outside
of mere voting and electioneering to
gain possession of the fair fields of
Louisiana, and place her government
in the hands of her interested sons.
We have heretofore rested satisfied
in the interval between elections
when' we shouls have exerted our
selves to bring to our assistance such
recruits as er necessities demanded.
Now that we are in a position, if net
to pass good laws, at liast to stop ag
gressive legislation, much more is
demanded of us between this and
1876 than formerly. We can with
better hope of success invite to till
our soilp, the richest and fairest in
America, the white men of the North
and West; men who are identified
with aour race and its interests; who
have built up the great sister States
of the Union, and are but extremely
anxious to come to our assistance
should proper indacements be held
eut to them. Our mechanics, mer
chants, farmers and land owners are
the men now to come forward to our
assistance. We have the country
and desire the labor, which is near
oar doors, can we not then devise a
means whereby the supply can be
made to meet our demand. Let a
judicious system of advertising be
inagurated to bring to the notice of
Swhite people elsewhere our wants,
and our word for it they will respond.
To have an exemplified instance of
the hate of our enemies, we have
but to regard the action of the House
Committee in counting out Caddo
parish, for there, notwithstanding the
fact of being over run with troops of
Cavalry noder command of Dog Mer
Srill, the gallant citizens won the elec
tion, still they can never le forgiven.
Shreveport is the home of the Times,
and smarting under the blows of that
journal (for we can conceive no other
I reason) out of pure revenge the Com
mittee deliberately take away from
the people of Caddo their justly earn
ed and proudly won rights. We
opine there is such a thing as get
ting even, and we judge our friends
Sof the mres as well as the citizens of
Caddo, will put in some smart blows
for this.
We understand that Mr. Pauckette,
tax collector for this parish, has been
instructed by Gov. Kellogg, to recog
size the People's Police Jury of this
parish. This will be gratifying to
Sour tax-payers, and in a measure
Smake up for our Mloss of other officials.
We do not know that a better Police
Jury could be selected and one that
wonuld study more closely 'the inter
eat of the tax-payers.

In all the cry of reform from the
Radical press, we have failed to see
them enunciate one measure of re
lief; name one bad law they wished
repealed, and as an evidence that
this cry from them is all bosh, we ap
pend the following from the N. O.
Picayune, as a morsel of the reform
of the "Rump."
All the appropriations made up to
this time, inclmuding that to the met
ropolitan police" ($135,000), the Gene
ral Assembly ($158,000), the Return
ing. Board ($19,000), the census ($85,
000), and the Assistant Sergeants-at
arms ($8000), amounting to $1,558,
8.56 23. Deducting about $100,000
from this, being various sources of
revenue to the Charity Hospital, et
al., leaves $1,458,856 23, which is
$558,856 in excess of the revenue.

the Treasurer had better turn it
over to thesemen at once, and Brown,

The appointment by President
Grant, of J. Madison Wells, as Sur
veyor of the port of New Orleans is,
as the Picapye justly says, a flagrant
defiance of the public opinion of the
country-a reward for acts proven to
be unlawful and outrageous. But of
such are federal o~icials made. In a
tight place where it requires lying and
stealing, Wells is knot a bad friend,
and Grant at this particular moment
seems to be surrouinding himself with
that ciass of people.
Let us now have long tom ander
son (we don't prepose to spell this
name with caps) in some high official
position, and the enountry, at least
Grant's part of it, is safe.

We give below from the N. O.
BLulleti,, a nice bit of "reform meas
ure" for our blatant Radical friends
to discuss, and we are of the opinion
their rct!ections will not be so cheer

seeming want of virtue in their par
ty leaders, but pure tears of madness
for not being one of the happy re
cipients of some of the people's mon

The Legislature, or rather the two
Houses presided over respectively by
Michael Ilahn and Cmsar Antoine, it
will be remembered, passed an appro
priation of 156,000 for mileage and
per diem of the members thereof. This
appropriation necessarily included
the fifty-three Conservative members
returned by the Returning Board. as
the Radical members.
Immediately before the adjourn
ment of the aforesaid Legislature, one
of the Conservative members went in,
and shortly after three others took
the oath from Hahn, who, by the
way, had no authority to administer,
it; and those four Conservatives got
their warrants, and it is to be pre
sumed have realized upon them. It
now transpires that there has been a
first-class swindle perpetrated upon
the forty nine Conservative members.
The certificates for their pay have
been illegally and fraudulently issued
by the committee having charge of
the matter, and the money has gone
into pockets for which it was never
intended.
This is a barefaced and mnott un
mitigated swindle, and we call the
attention of Attorney General Field
to the matter. It is his duty to pro
secute all persons who rob the State,
and it is a duty he cannot avoid or
escape without rendering himself li
able to the charge of conniving a
fraud.
We suppose the members who have
thus been egregiously swindled will
have a recourse against the State, and
that some legislative relief will ne
cessarily be granted; but it will be
a tedious matter and the tax-payers
will, in the end, have to settle for
this raid on the State Treasury.
Capt. Dick Sinnott, that untiring
steamboatsman, was at oar wharf on

trust that Capt. Dick will long con

will meet with that reward they de
serve. Our old friend Hamilton looks
as smiling as ever, and does the
honors of the office with his usual
urbane politeness and ability. Messrs.
Dowty and French are the assistant
Clerks of this packet. The Bart
Able has now become one of the fix
tures in our trade, and in all times

Hon. G. A. Sheridan's career in
Congress was short but sweet. In
24 hours he grabbed the back pay and
appointed Percy Parker a cadet to
West Point. Parker is a nephew of
Gen. B. F. Butler, and oar readers
can new draw their own inferences.
We say that although George may

We would recommend the Go,
ernor to look into the matter of My

as an April beax, the people here will
be compelled to come forward and
resist it. Myers has "got or with
Sabout all the money we have drawn
for school purposes in this parish for
some years, and our citizens do not
propose to allow him to continue to
Sdo so, whether Kellogg desires it or
not.
As a movement of reform the ap
pointment of Boulit, Myers, Blunt,
!Monette and Raby, as members of
I the School Board for this parish, is
ludicrous, and well calculated to make
people inquire into thie meaning of
Kellogg in so doing. Two political

Federal Appointments.
The Republican, with its usual neat
style of reasoning, finds anm analogy,
between the case of the Grant parish
prisoners and Gov. Wells. The ar
gunment is that the Supreme Court
has decided that Congress has no
juripdiction in the Republican's
opinilon, ought to have no jurisdic
tion in Well's case, even to the
extent of adopting tile report of
the commuitt&e which denounced his
action as illegal: and arbitrary. The
conclusion seems to be that if the
Grant parish prisoners cannot he
punished under an unconstitutional
law, Gov. Wells is an eminently fit
man to be made Surveyor of the Port.
The Republican accuses the Picayune
of demanding the perpetual disfran
chisement of Gov. Wells on account
of an error of judgment committed
by that patriotic citizen. But this is
a mistake. The Picayune said that
there could be no reason for the ap
pointment of Gov. Wells except his
conduct as a member of the Return
ing board, and that having been for
this denounced and condemned .by
Congress, by a Republican commit
tee, and by the public opinion of the
county, it would seem that it ought
to operate as a disqualification rather
than as a recommendation. If Pres
ident Grant owns the public offices
which lie no doubt believes-and if
he may properly dispose ot them at
his own jweet will-which he is in
the habit of doing--only criticism on
the manner in which ihe distributes
his patronage would be irrelevant,
not to say impertinent. But we al
ways suppose that the public had
some interest in these matters, and
r that the claims of office-holders and
office-hunters were legitimate objects
of discussion. As to Gov. Wells, his
appointment is simply a flagrant defi
lance of the public opinion of the
country-a reward for acts of demon
strated lawlessness, and for conduct
which has been stigmatized by all
impartial men as outrageous and un
Sjustifiable. If the Supreme Court
should decide that the Grant parish
* prisoners are unconstitutionally pros
ecuted, it does not follow that Gov.
B Wells acted lawfully, or that he is a
fit man to be appointed Surveyor of
1 the Port.-N. O. Picayune.
s We have had a very good opinion
5 of Mr, James G. Blaine, late Speaker
r of the House of Representatives. We
thought he was a man of courage and
nerve, who could tell some plain
9 truths-though they might be ever
i so unpalatable-to his politie al
friends. His speech at New Haven
during the Connecticut canvas, we
a regret to say, does not sustain any
Ssuch assumption. The old State party
r regimen was sewed up; nothing was
s said of the abuses of the Republican
party. He stated that the Democra
tic party could not be trusted with
s the control of the Government. Mr.
e Jefferson Davis was commented upon
il for the part he took in politics years
ago, and-Mr. Blaine said-was very
powerful in the South to-day. He
t like Cassanda predicted the ruin of
t his own party, unless Conecticut
went their way. Buchanan was lug
goed in by the ears-and although
poor old Buck has been deader than
his party for many years-yet he
receited a most bitter rebauke for his
Presidential policy. Now we sub
a mit it to the people who think, wheth
er trhis sort of talk is good sense or
not. It would have been bad enough
in a cross-roads candidate-but for
* the man, who by common consent is
f fule priaceps-the head and front of
Sintelligent progressmive Republicanism
-to talk like this, is to give the ca
' sual outsiders, who read this speecm,
I a very poor opinion of the honesty,
a to say nothing of the ability of the
11 party so led. This is a world of dis
appointments, and no public man has
so disappointed the country as Mr.
Blaue. It may be that his prospec
. tire candidacy for the Presideney

e have prevented his talking good sense.
