T Comical Mac Howry.
" The genal and rather brilliant
l hE ditor of the Lake Charles New
Road is certainly entitled to the
above app)ellation for his perverse
and way ward inconsistency.
The New Road belongs, we have
or. en told, to the Watkins Banking
er. Co., which owns also, according to
_ good bankers' custom, a I)emo
r cratic and a Republican paper in
'o Lake Charles.
Editor llowry supports Bro.
Booth for Governor because he is
r'"in the middle of road," and is so
00
Scompletely the idol of the Popu
cD lists that they cannonized him in
on their convention, and forbid all
o( subsequent action by that naughty
- State central committee. Yet he
in- supports the balance of the ticket
of said naughty coummittee, on
r which are two republicans, as he
avers.
Hie said that he held back the
publication of one issue of his
paper from Saturday till Monday,
iw to learn the action of the Populist
Press Association. by which ac
t tion, he said in the same article,
h be would abide. But though said
Press Associotion voted 11 against
e 1 to indorse Pharr, Bro. Mac
didn't do it.
Bro. Mac's "middle of the road"
fort, though, is his strong argu
ment for Bro. Booth, and yet he
is supporting Kinney Reid, a dem
ocrat for Sheriff, and H. C. Gill,
a Foster-appointed-democrat for
Clerk, and democ;ats for Judge,
District Attorney, Magistrates and
Constables.
We have promised not to binder
the Booth supporters or "make
them afraid," but we would like to
understand why a man can be so
indifferent to a continuation of Fos
terism for 4 years more and the
destruction of manhood by money
in the adoption of the suffrage
amendment, as to vote for Booth
as a "middle-of-the-roador," and
then vote for a democratic clerk
and sheriff.
No wonder Bro. Mac gives us at
hint every now and then of some I
dissatisfaction over his course
among the 1000 Populists of Cal- ¶
casieu.
Bro. Mac's goodey, goodey talk "
about having been a Populist for t
S20 years, sounds like Bro. Booth I
and Bro. Waddill, both of whomi
say the same, yet we are told that ,
Bro. Booth voted for McEnery in c
'92, against Populist nominee Tan- t
nehill, and we've heard that Bro.
Waddill is a goldbug, and from
his indirect support of Foster we're 1
inclined to believe it. We saw a i
letter of his dated about January I
23rd last, in which he stated that
he was "a dissatified democrat."
The democrats may not appreci- t
ate your good work, Bro. Mac, a
but they ought to, for it's very
plam that you'll help them much
more than you will the "middle
of-the-road" cause0

mlated to address many of you

oil home in Linc dn parish, and
cannot return for some time, on
nt account of the rigid iluar.intine,
!w and my own town, 1Rosbline, would
be not permit me to return after I
so had taken a tour of a great part
of the parish, andi I could not
think of leaving my three daught
vc ers at home without a parental
Ig protector, eve'n if I could go out of
to and come back to our town.
As the time is approaching
when you all s'aould be making u
in your minds as to whom you will
vote for to represent your parish
o. in the l.gislature, I think it due
is you to tell you how I stand on the
questions you are interested in.
To Tbegin on, I .am unalterlably fix
- ed in favor of free silver, and
in shall support no man for the Un:t
Ili ed States Senate who is not out
ty spok, n in favor of free silver at
16 to 1, independent of all other
10 nations. Next, I ani. and have al
et ways been opl osed to the suffrage
mn amendment ~ith the qualifications
e prol)osed by the first sections of
No. 2,1, and am most bitterly op
posed to the section which leaves
'e the onestion possible to change by
is even a unanimous vote of the leg
`, islature. I do not think the peo
st ple should ever surrender their
- right to pass upon the change of
any part of the constitutional law.
D, If there were no other objection,
d that clause should seal its doom.
at I am in favor of more liberal
Lc approplriations tot he public schools
and think the status of public edu
,, cation should be more a matter for
State pride than the market value
I- of its bonds. I am in favor of as
se sisting school districts to erect bet
- ter school hous.s in which children
can keep comfortalde in the win
ter months, when they can best be
r spared from the work on the farm.
, I favor having good hih schools,
d ample appropriations to keep up t
the high standard of the State c
r Normal and the Industrial schools, I
in fact, I think the education of the I
e people should be the highest aunbi- t
> tion of every good citizen. (
a I believe that the place to begin t
,reform is at home. A man who f
will cast his vote for a candidate n
who does not represent his ideas of o
Y government, should never talk re
c from, for he shows by his own
b act that he is not willing to help to
1 secure it. To get reform we must
first get our wards right, then our y
parishes, then the State, and b
through these we can reach the na
a tional government. The man who C
a votes for a goldbug for legislator i'
or governor need not hope to help tl
elect a free silver president and ti
- free silver congress. Without a
fair ballot and an honest count-
C which we cannot hope to get
r through a corrupt machine-we e,
need not hope to get men to rep- c
resent our ideas in the national leg- w
islature. We must call for hbonest
methods and honest men from g)v
a ernor down, and this means that o
the law must be regarded and ful re
ly enforced. The law is quite b
good enough as it is, but it should e
be crrried out to the letter.
It more favorable conditions make
a it possible I shall try to visit all
parts of the parish between now o0
and -the election. If I cannot do h
this, I hope those who do not know p
me will put themselves to the
trouble to investigate my past life,
and judge me according to that, k
as to my fidelity to principle, andl
what I helieve right. I have been a
in the State twenty odd years ;
spent 18 in Lincoln parish, and al
by the tiay of election will
have been four years in Robeline. A
Leaving myself in your hands, Ic
remain Yours RespectfullyS.
A CARD. - 0o
About two wetk's ago there ap- st
peared in the People's Demanads, 9
of Col.ax, a statement by E. A.
Matlhis, its editor at that time, e
about as follows:
"Brian says thait the ,lnemng
Pharr at thie head of the Popullist
ticket meauns three or four hundred
dollars to every P'opulist paper in fr
the State." ol
Having long since refused th
recognize Mathls as my equal, and
having previously received an na
solicited retraction and apology
from said Mathis for a somewhat
similar charge, I paid no attention
to this silly falsehood.
But several papers of more or
lass doubtfal repute having given a
the libel publicity, I take thisa u
method of denouncing it as nual-i. a
ciously false, and its originator, to
Mathia as a liar of less than ordi- fr
mary caliber. fr

The Item has long recognized
I the fact that Cage, Kellogg and
e other corruption:sts and tricksters
were secretly aiding Murphy J.

their undying support of Pharr.
('Convinced of this, the editor of
. the It-m yesterday addressed the
u following letter to Capt. Pharr,
e now at Mansfield, in DeS ,to parish
f on his campaign tour :
New Orleans, La., March 12.
Capt. J. N. Pharr, Mansfield, La.
t Dear Sir : It must be clear to
ryou that Thomas A.. Cage, who I
l has just assumed to appoint a I
cappaign committee professedly I
in your interest, and oth:-rs of that I
tribe of corruptionists, are in ac
1 tive allegiance with Murphy J.
Foster, in his struggle to perpetu
ate the power of stuffed ballot box
es in Louisiana, They fill the
columns of the Democratic press
with professions of loyalty to you,
only in order that upon your hon.
ored shoulders the ignominy of their
records may he borne, Cage is a
bribe-taker as the Item is prepar
ed to prove in any court of justice
in the State.
The Item knows the treachery
of these men. It knows to what
base uses they are lending them- 3
selves in this campaign, but all the
good people in this State do not
know these things.
The Item asks at your hands an
Iavowal of your position with re
gard to these corrupt aiders and c
abettors of Murphy J. Foster. -
All decent men of every party'
loathe and abhor such cattle, and
the Item feels assured that you
share the views of the honest mass
es. A reply by wire is asked, in I
order that the forces of right and t
justice may get at once from their
standard-bearer an open express- g
in as to these corruptionists and
eecret assistants of FEoster, m his"
effort to re-enslave the people.

tion of Cage and Kellogg. They

your apology to your readers in
double doses.
Editor Louisiana Populist :
There appeared in the Natchito
ches Enterprise of. March 5, 1896,
an editoriol based on the appoint
ment of J. G. Lewis and myself,
on a committee to organize the
campaign in this parish. This
appointment, if made, was without
my solicitation or knowledge, and
I know no more of it than through
the papers. I am not organizing
the campaign in this parish-fur
ther, I am not and have not for
years been in political accord
with J. G. Lewis. I am
not engaged in organizing ne
groes against whites. I am, on
the contrary, quietly engaged in
attending my duties as pastor of
the Baptist church. I know of
no campaign going on between (
whites and blacks, and hope there
never will be. I know I never
will be in one. I hear through
the papers and especially through
the Times-Democrat that at Baton
Rouge, Gibsland, and other places,
Governors Kellogg and Foster,
Mr. Blanchard and others, appeal
ed to the negroes to vote the Dem
ocratic ticket, and no harm is
thought of it.
Both the Pharr and Foster tick
ets have white men as candidates t
and I cannot see that a preference
for the one or the other would be
massing negroes against whites.
I am an old man, and desire to £
pass the remainder of my days min
peace and good will to all men.
I hope you will publish this as
an act of justice to me, and leave I
me to enjoy the repose of a quiet
life. I further state that I have
not been asked by the Populist or a
an other party to support their
