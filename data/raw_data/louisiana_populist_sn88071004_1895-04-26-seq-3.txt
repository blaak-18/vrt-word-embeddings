April 5.-ly.
At a meeting of the Parish Farm
erms Alliance, the following reso
lutions were adopted:
Whereas, the Fi'rmers Alliance
is the only organization in which
the farmers as a profession can ed
ucate themselves socially, political
ly and morally, and
Whereas this organization has
proven its ability as such an educa
tor, and has wonderfully elevated
and ennobled our profession in the
last few years, andi
Whereas the Farmers seem to
have failed to compare their pres
ent exalted state, educationally at
least, with the degraded position
which they occupied before the ad
vent of the Farmers Alliance, and
thereby failed to realize the won
derful benefits of the order, andl
Whereas for the want of such cif
appreciation of its benefits the far- da
mers have neglected their organi- in
zation and allowed it to sink in this
parish, and
Whereas the present is a most
opportune time to reorganize the ed
Farmers Alliance and bring it back
to its pristine vigor and equip it
with that power for good that it
has once possessed. se
Therefore Resolved, that this -
Parish Farmers Alliance call upon
all the defunct sub-Alliances in
j Natchitoches parish to revive and
meet us in our next quarterly ses
sion, and we urge all farmers to -
exercise that cool judgment and
good sense which the interest of
their business and families demand
t and affiliate with some sub Alliance.
By Mr. Roberts: Whereas our
r Hon. Police Jury, at its last session
d agreed to economise. and build a
new Court-house in our parish
without raising our assessments or
* increasing our taxes.
Be it Resolved, that we as a
* body heartily endorse, appreciate
e and approve of its actions.
e The Alliance adjourned to meet
at Natchitoches on the 2nd Thurs
day of July, 1895.
