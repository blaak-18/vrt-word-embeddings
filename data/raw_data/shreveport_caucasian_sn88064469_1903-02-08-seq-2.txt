FRU BJORNSON.
The Beautiful, Gifted Wife of N~,r
way's Most Distinnguished Author.
The greatest man Norway lhas pro
duced since old viking days is perhaps
Bjornstjerne Bjornson. lie is so gre:it
that in spite of his minle we in Aln(lr
ica are familiar with his fatw. .\
hundred times more pe, opl k o: wif
his writinas than kno.w how to prH
nounce his distiinluishid n.;aar. lie is
the most versatile literary niaun of his
time in any langlluae.
Well, it is gradualy com,:ian to ie
known that he does it thlrough the
aid of a wife as cap:able in ler way as
he is in his. Fru Karoline ieiners
Bjornson is her husband's sec'iretary
and counselor. In both the mec(haLnical
and intellectual departments of his
tasks she is at his side, sweet, wis'e 1and
strong. If there ever was the perf.fe.-t
woman, nobly planned, it is Fru i3jorn
son.
A. photograph of the husband and
wife made about the lime of tlih cele
bration of Bjornson's seventiethl birth
day gives the impression that tliey
must be the handsomenst elderly mar
ried couple in all Europe. It shows
that mcIn and women ,who live the
right lives, serene, loving. kindly and
strong. need not fall to pieces even as
they approach seventy. Fru Bjornson
has rather large features, as befits a
Slarge woman mentally and physically,
but they are classic and beautiful. Iler
hair, now snow white, is abundant and
fluffy, softening a royal forehead. It
is doubtful if the famous author andl
his wife were so handsome in their
youth. They look like a married pair
whom the gods love so well that time
is not permitted to touch them except
to beautify.
Notable in Bjornson's writings is the
wholesome, happyfying tone. Thley are
not painful, morbid pictures of miser
able men and women, like so many of
Ibsen's andl Tolstoi's. It is a good
world. preaches Bjornson, a bright, lov
ing world. if we only take it in the
right way. which is the way he him
self takes it. The women of Scandina
via adore Bjiornson. He holds them up
to be honored and respected. Hte paints
men such as women love and women
such as men love in a wholesome, nat
ural way. At the author's seventieth
birthday ce'ebration wocmen vied with
men (loilng him honor. It was because
he had honored them so in his books.
Every man judges the whole fem
inine sex by his own wife and mother.
It is easy to divine whence Bjornson
obtained his exalted ideas of women
and his tenderness toward them. He
sees the whole sex in beautiful, noble
Kamroline leimers. What she has been
to him he naturally thinks other wives
must be to other husbands. If Ibsen
had been so fortunate in marriage as
his literary compatriot, his stories and
dramas must have taken a different
tone.
Fru Bjornson is manifest especially
in the couple's country home at An
lestad. She was married in 1S-S to
Iljor.nson, but not until recent years
has the Anlestad home ibeenl comnlted.
Like the married life of the pair who
II
FRU BJORNSTJERNE BJORNSON AND HER
HOME.
live there, it is as nearly perfect as
anything can be in this existence. The
farm is a large one and one of the best
cultivated in Norway. The house is
very large and luxuriously furnisued
and full of admirable art pieces. There
is a group of I uildings occupied by the
farm workers. The landscape is mag
nificent. Standing on the veranda of
Anlestad one gets a glimpse of moun
tain, valley, sky and water. Through
the valley below where the house is
built flows the river Gansa. The view
shows nature in her most picturesque
dress--nature mingling at the same
time with man's conquest over nature.
Through the lands of the Bjornsons
runs a tumbling brook, supplying a wa
ter power. The water power is cap
tured and turned into electricity to
illuminate not only the home, but also
the stables and outbuildings.
Fru Bjornson is always close to her
husband, which is w'se in her or in any
wife so long as she does not bore the
husband. In beautif'ul Anlestad the
housekeeping, whether for two or for
twenty-the Bjornsons are noted for
their hospitality--is peudectly ordered
and moves without a jar. The pair al
ways spend the summers there. In the
winter BJornson travels in some Euro
pean country-Italy, France. Germnia
or England-or settles down in some
artistic and literary capital. Herr
again the beautiful, gentle, wise wife
is always,with him. They have sever
al children now grown. One daughter.

The first tusk was for' the whole

walk h:wkwaird up th;e creek bunk to

were soinethiag incredible. Either the

notized into believing he saw the high
priest spring straight upl out of that
water twenty feet in the air. The
hypnotic theory seems hardly possible
since he was not a voodoo devotee alnd
the priests did not know of his pres
ence. At length priests and privates
went off into contortions more extraor
dinary and frightful thaln a;nything a
professional could achieve. Suhddenly a

At this moment the Frenchman, with
the lively sensibilities of his race, had
the greatest ditficiulty to keep from
falling fainting off his horse. The
priest next directed his followers eachl
