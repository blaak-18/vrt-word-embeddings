taining a severe fracture of the skull.
A Gazette man took a ride over
to Creighton's switch the fore part of
the week, and viewed with some
surprise the big stacks of sugar cane
waiting transportation to the mills,
but when informed that for the past
month or more just such quantity
was in the yard all the time, the con
clusion irresistibly forced itself upon
the mind that if at this point such
quantities of cane are shipped,
without considering other shipping
points, the urgent need of a refinery
is manifest. With a refinery near
this town the acreage in cane would
be doubled in a year. We must
have it.
By inadvertance we failed to
mention in our compte-rendu of the
Carenero Amateur's entertainment

favorable mention by those qualified
to judge. At the request of many
friends the composer will have it
printed and place on sale, and will
call it the "Creole March." It is
to be hoped that it will meet with
re :dy sale.

place in the Catholic cemetery last

its reputation for fair dealing, fresh
goods and low prices.

W- A IT ."rDi";i ,ER'
A young white woman, named
Marie Celina Guidroz, aged about
23 years, was brought to town Wed
nesday by Deputy Sheriff Thomas
Mouton and placed in the parish
prison, charged with the murder of
Willie Melancon, a boy about
a years old. It appears that the I
accused wa, living with the foster
parents of Willie, Mr. and Mrs. 1
Vilmond- Melancon, near Carencro E
bayou. On Friday, Dec. 8, Marie
Guidroz went to the bayou.to wash
some potatoes, and took along with
her the little boy, who was subse
quently found drowned. We give
below the testimony given before
the coroner's jury and the verdict
of the jury:
Marie Celina Guidroz, after being duly
sworn, said: "'Friday last, Dec. 8, 1893, I
was washing potatoes on a raft in the ba
you. I had the child Willie Melancon on
my left arm; when the raft started drifting
I let the child drop in the bayou. Water at
that place was about waist deep I think.
When the child fell I started away. At the
moment I could not hallow, I was too much
afraid. " It was half an hour after that I could
call for assistance. When I reached home I
did not tell anyone that the child was
drowned"
Edouard Stelly said: "Last Frriday, Dec.
8, 5893, 1 was working at a sugar mill abot t
four arpents distant from home. When I
heard Marie Guidroa hallowing after Willie
who was drowned. Marie Guidroz said to
Mrs. Euclide Stelly: "It is no use to call
for Willie; where he is, he will not answer."
The child had a natural dread of water and
was not in the habit of going to the bayou.
The water where I found the child was about
two feet and a half deep. The child was
about five steps going up stream from the
raft.'"
Mrs.*Vilmond Melancon, the foster-mother
of the child, said: "Friday last, Dec. 8,
Marie Guidroz was coming in the house with
a dish of potatoes that she had washed in the
the hbayou. I asked her, 'Where is Willie ?'
She answered : 'He is there.' I asked Mrs.
Euclide Stelly to call him when Mary Gui
droz answed: 'It is no use to call him; he
will not answer where he is.' "
Vilmond Melancon, the foster-father of
the child, said: "'Friday last, Dec. 8, was
working at the sugar mill when I heard Ma
rie Guidroz hallowing. I started running,
following'Edwouard Stelly straight to the
bayou and found the child, Willie Melancon,
drowned. Marie Guidroz, when called for
assistance was running in a direction oppo
where the child who was drowned."
The jury of inquest, composed of Messrs.
Edgard Martin, J. Y. Villere, Lucien Cay
ret, Ernest Crouchet, C. L. Villere, and
Coroner Gladu, rendered the following ver
dict:
* * * said Willie Melancon came to
his death by drowning while being in charge
of Marie Celina Guidroz, and, we, the ju
rors, find Marie Celina Guidroz guilty of
gross negligence, if not more, and we sug
gest an investigation by the grand jury."
Fond of Watches.
A suspicious looking negro was
arrested by Marshal Vigneaux near
the depot last Tuesday. He gave
his name as George Washington
White and a search in his valise
developed the fact that he had in
his possession three watches and a

to be very -valuable. As White
could not give a satisfactory account
of himself and his watches he was
incarcerated in the municipal bastile,
awaiting new developments.
