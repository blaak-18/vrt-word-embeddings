A telegram from Idaho says
"that the Republicans will carry
the entire State ticket as many
Democrats are voting the Repub
lican ticket just to crush the Pop
ulist." We have claimed all the
while that both old parties are one
and the sam thing, so far as the
money power is concerned. Can't
you see it
orse ad worse.
A merchant in Montgomery, La.,
told us that be had shipped five
bales of cotton this fall, ad one
bale failed to pay the expenses on
the lot. Therefore we may say

element that coasums more than

ty, and it is the duty of all men to
0 support it. Also those who enter
homesteads have a right to select
their own paper for advertising.
Don't fail to give us a call and vwe
will treat you well.
PERIONAL MENTION.
Mr. Jno. A. Barlow and his two sons.
Marco and lynn, arrived last night, and
are the guests of Editor W. H. Tunnard.
-Shreveport Times.
Mr. Barlow is our genial and efficient
Deputy Clerk of Court, and we wish
him and his boys a pleasant trip.
Mr. U. P. Breaeale, one of our gen

week. Pleasant trip to you "Upsher."
Mr. Calvin Carter, of Winn parish,
was a pleasant visitor to our office on
Wednesday.
We were pleased to receive a call from
Mr. A, J. Franks on Wednesday. Mr.
Franks is a Police Juror from ward 8 in
Winn parish.
Mr. McK Holston, one of our enter
prising business men, accompanied by
his daughters, Misses Lelia and Isa,

to take in the Fair. We wish them a

call on Thursday, and a talk with him
convinces us that he with all other hon

condemnation of an indignant people.
So mote it be.

We get this statement from two differ

The Record Condemns Them.
No man can truthfully say that
the Democratic party favors the
free coinage of silver at any ratio,
because in 1892, with 148 Demo
cratic majority in the lower House,
they defeated a free coinage bill
passed by a Republican Senate.
Again, -in 1894, a Congress that
had 92 Democratic majority in the
Senate, defeated a free silver coin
age bill by a good safe majority at
t16 to 1, also at 17, 18, 19, and 20
to 1. These facts none deny, and
with them before him any one who
yet says, "I believe the Demo
cratic party will give us free silver
coinage," is hermetically sealed up
in prejudice, and colldl not be
made to believe that two and two
make four if his political masters
told him to dispute it.-Southern
Mercury.
Now is the time to buy meal and
hulls. The Marco Oil 31111 will

meal at 75 cents per sack. Lay in

Oct 26.
Impotent Democrats.
A corner on money is a corner on
everything that money will buy,
and the bankers have this corner.
Cieveland himself admitted to
Congressman Oates that "the
bankers ihad the government by
the leg." Think of $400,000,000
idle money in the banks of New
York, and all the South and West
dying financially for lack of it. E v
ery honest industry languishing,
the body politic bleeding at every
pore; labor hunting for work at
aly price; children begging for
bread and women weeping. The
old Democratic party has shown
itself impotent to help us in this
our sore time of need.-Pioneer
Exponent.
The Poor Man's Party.
The People's party is the poor
man's party. And there are
enough poor men in this country
to4day to run its government in
their own interests, if they will
but vote together, and let the rich
men who run the two old parties
get along as best they can without
them.-Museatine Populist.
We represent none but first-class
companies that pay all losses with
lirompltness.

"The proof of the padding is in
the eating thereof." We have eat
en suSncently of the pudding serv
ed by the monopolies of the land
and have found ourselves wanting
in prspelrity, and simply because
of the treachery of political lead
era, who have feathered the nests
of the few by the enactment of
class laws. Isn't it about time for
another baking, one that will result
In a pudding calculated to botter
the health of the nation t--Non
conformist.
The United States produces
enough food to supply every citi
sen bountifully. Its factories are
able to furnish all the clothing
needed; coal wood and minerals
are in the greatest abundance, and
the people industrious and full of
energy, yet want, destitution, hun
ger and snfering are coastat
guests in thousands of homes.
Evidently natural conditions are
not to blame, but the injustice of
mun, or man-made laws, is. Is
there any plausible reason why the
people should suber from such
laws anl their results when they
have the power to alter themI
If the people snfer they have
themselves alone ti-blame. Let
them arouse themselves, study the
situation, and act like men worthy
of a better state; demand and see
to it that these evils are corrected.

Waite's Head Level
I)ENVER, Colo.-Gov. Waite has
written an open letter to the Popu
list party of Colorado, in which he
strongly opposes fusion with the
democrats. In conclusion he says:
"I have endeavored to the best of
my ability to run the affairs of the
State in the interest of the miners
and the laboring men, and so far as
I could have stepped upon the aris
tocratic thieves and robbers who
have stolen the State post in prey.
ious administraiions, and even de
frauded the school children of the
State of nearly $500,000.
"If we can not, after two years,
and after carrying the State, suc
ceed again on our platform and
with our own men, and without
looking for support outside the
party organization, then the Peo
ple's party is premature and the
American people are not yet ready
for reform."
Waite some day will be honored
as he deserves to be. A short time
ago he declined an offer by the
gamblers of Denver to put $30,000
into the Populist campaign tand if
he woukil let them resume business.
That's the kind of a governor to
have, even if the plutocrats lie
about him.-The Advance.
Recreancy of the Democrate.
If the Democratic party lived up
to its principles there would be no
place for a People's party. But as
the situation sitand the Populists
have taken the Democratic princi
ples and the plutocrats have cap
tured the Demoeratic party. And
so it is that in eomamunities where
joint debates are conaned to Re
publicans and Democratice disput
ants the auditors, though they bear
both speakers, will get only one
side of the question.--Chicago
