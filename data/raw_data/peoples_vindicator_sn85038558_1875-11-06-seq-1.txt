THE CLINTON MTTER: a
An Exhaustive Resume of the l
Situation.

ti
THE CAUSES WiIIICII LED TO TIIE RE
CENT ,TROUBLES.
[From the N. O. Picaynne.l`
CLINTON, LA. Oct. 19, 1875.
To the Editor of the Picayune:
The people of New Qrleans are nat
urally startled by what has been ter.n
ed the "lawlessness in East Feliciana,"
and without a proper, understanding o
of the whole situation injustice may
be dlone us by somen of our own most
thoughtful and judicious friends. The e
recent events in our parish are not t
the mere uncontrolable and reckless
otourweaks' of lawless'men with noth
ing in the graLn~noauon . tur'bulnt
passions, they are the result iof a
matured and delibhe'ate policy which
has been forced upon our most con
servative people by the excesses of
those who have enjoyed power here.
It is notorious that our people have C
been the most conservative and sub- a
missive to to te new order of things of
all;the people of the country parishes.
The people here, under the guidance j
of enlightened leaders, have recog- a
nized the necessity of yielding to the t
national authority, and of giving a
fair trial to the system of reconstruc
tion which it had inaugurated. With
out violence or lawlessness, without t
interference with the fair expression j
of the new sunffingans at the polls, the I
party in power was permitted to oc
copy the, pulip .administration, and t
became thereby respqysible for thlei
lidblic order;, and the security of life 1
and propetltyi'This passive attitude
"wasmawaintained' until the release of
all restraints .upon the vicious and '
depraved, the dissolution of pill the i
safregiads fdr thld protection of prop- a
erty, led: to at stNt of doeiety so nn
bearable, that the people took energy
from despair, and deterspiued,Ay their
'owniresolution to save, the ire.lnaliua
offheir property fromi pill~gc, and
society from dishonor and dissolution. d
'As: soon as the Radical authority t
was firily established in - the parish
a band of pegro roughs, organized
anid maiiltjined by ppblic planlnder, as
semhle~ti Clinton, and with appa
rent inpunity-~iaukeet some of our
,best:nud most respected !citizens, in
some. ita~ces threatening their lives at
with vinolhuce. Gair, Ray, Smith, a
Clark and other lelaers, formed a s
council for the *,golation of oirl par
oehial affairs. Under the shadow of
their mighty protection neither Iffe i1
or property was safe in the parish.
Cattle, hogs and other domestic an.- s
imMls were stolen; and the thief had a
the collusive aid of strong and in
fluential partisans to hide tile booty Js
and to shield his guilt. When the
harvest ripened in the field it was g
stolen off by a regular and perfected o
system. The convenient deadfall was
in every neighborhood tempting the d
brutal appetites of the negro laborers a
to theft, with mean whisky and tolae
co. When our people, irritated by g
some. such outrage, ventured an ' ex- c
pression of apger, the threat of burn,.
ing anid of negro mobs furpsshed the n
conven ient refort. And accordingly n
in'·~et'fIhb~: 1874, 'the clh0ulgg n-,
tagainisals Of the twiv classes 'led to l
the assemblage of a large negro mob
under the leadershlip of one Lewis
Jones, a member of our Police Jury. n
This mob was disper.~ed without a 1
collisien, owing to the signal moderan -
tion of our people.
In all these troubles our conserva. C
tiqecitize~a,tirusted that the courts 6
would finally 0fford a remedy. Bpt
at the last temn of the District Court, !
in ray, this hop'e was rudely dispel
ed.: With a iast majority of negroea
on thejury list, and with the excln Ii
sion of whites in criminal trials of 3
negroes by the exercise of the legal
challenges, it became evident that a
negro~tould not be condemned for an a
offl:se against, a white man. Gair. e
Ray and their crowd. had their seats a
in the court-room, aild witlh tile vast d
influnence theygexerted bn the iguorant
negrdio they exerted on the ignorant t
negroes, they dictated verdicts. This h
fact was made plhin mn several cases
whlich thie public was coniiderlng with I
senaitivt 'htchfulness.
2. The ease of the State vs. Lewis S
Joaes for the illegal assembly just re. i
ferred to, demounstrated that the law
ofiirded no remedy against negro I
riots.
2. .Tn'the trial · idf eighlt men front
WeAit Felicinank, arraigned for tile
terder;of young Hale, it was shown
that the life of a man, ;coul ,not be

had been assigned for Ihinor offenses.
and with the result that he was in
the habit of making a joke of the
prosecutions against him. This 'peace.
able and unoffending" citizen habit
ually disregarded the l:ws regarding
the carrying of concealed weapons,
and among his little pleasantries
,when drunk, he would now and then
calmhn the iublic irritation by threats I
to burn our town.
The publid mind was inflamed
enough on the adjournnent of court
by the observation of these mischiev- I
ots perveresions of justice; but the
ingenuity of our persecutors there
upon discovered a new opportunity
of personal degradation to is and of I
pillage for- their petty officials. With
negro magistrates, with the piecedent
established in the District Court that I
there was no punishment for perjry, I
every laborer in the parish offended i
at any little circumstance on the
farm was encurnaged to have his eu.
loi.ver ar.rewt, 1 e . -* -. nr,.- r v,
bon' at his bcost--about ten dollars.
To show that this was adopted as a
concerted plan, in one magistrate's
court, in eightjudicial days seven of
our planters were arraignedl on frivol
ous charges-a lucrative busintes,
you will admit. By this expedient
every right of the citizen was sub-it
jected to the discretion of an ignorant
and depraved ollicial, for his discre
tion could not be controlled4Jy ap
peal.
In this situation of affairs our peo
ple had no legal channel in which
they could find redress. Forsworn
juryman and peljnred- witnesses
blocked the halls of public justice ;
the receiver of stolen goons and the
thief were wasting their substance
and every legal expedient of redress
was Covered oift And enveloped in t
the slime of corruption,.
The lternative presented was to
abandon. civilization, homes and every
interest'.dlar to men, or to hold the
'authors of these things to acCOfnt. I
abilityg We. believe that eTren the I
grpqd:of a Radical offlice-holder would I
su5tinit. to the determination of n!en,
who. are actuated by the fanaticism
of desliair. If there' still remainis' a

Troubles of Newspapers. I
The Richmond (Va.) Christian Ad
'cocate, colnmmenting on the newspa
per business, publlishes the followiing
interesting article on the subject, 1
whiclh may be read with profit by t
others than those engaged in the ar- Ii
duous pursuit of publishing a news- ti
paper : y
"There are two great troubles 5
about a newspaper-one grows out of a
the effort to make it live, the otiter I
Jout of tihe effort to please everybody. ro
T're first trouble ma;ly be overcome, ,
tihe second never. Every newspaper h:
man in the world has an ideal, as lie s
calls it-perhaps he menus idol-and of
is always trying to reach it, and nevg
er does, wlhich is very strange. Sonei s
people believe that there is a fortune dt
in every newspaper in the whole tl
world, from Nova Zembla to Victoria nr
Tand. These people are very honest, d
"!'.,v agicere, -III1tt vr J :... n'. , 1 i AI
their belief. If they had to try the h.
harness on, and work in it awhile, ci
they would soon sing another tulle.
Note what follows : The Christian it
Standard, of Cincinnati, states that dt
although its aftalrs are conducted e,
with the strictest economy, and its w
subsciibers number 12,0010, it has. thus e:
flr cost $20,00( more than its intcome. L
It says that The Adradnce, of Chic.go, l
with a still larger subhscription list, L
sunk about $75,00)0 in four years, nnd il
had not become selft-sustaining whe di
the late fire occurred ; that The late- w
rior, inll less than two years, has used Ia
up a eapital of nearly $50,000; and -
that The Standord, of Chicago, with
15,000 subscribers, was not self-suas
tainintg. But all these papers learn a;
lesson, and that is that crledit is the it
death of newspapers. Hence, if you li
take these papers, they will let yen *'
run to the, da.ly you pay up to, and l
then drop you like a hot potato ; that hi
is unless you renew. Cash is their Iii
life: (o to' the N6w York Herald of- ct
tice-that mignificent establishmnent Ii
grew out of a Wall Street cellar. Do tl
you wish to take the Herald ? Dowp am
with your money. 1)o you wish to 1e:
advertise at a dollar a line ? Hand tli
your advertiset ent and your money PI
in through that pigeon-hole, take bi
back, your receipt and be gone. When ti

If the elections of 1875 ggo against

every stealer of public money, from it

SSustain the Honor of the Farmer.
There is a measure of commerrial in
Stegrity in business circles that we
- hope may reach the farmer. The
fiast busintess man 1111ay settle every
year with his creditors at from 5 to
S50) cents on the dollar, pursue with
f out the interrnption of a day or hour
r his busines a.nd his pleasures, and he
received upon change and in society
without a disparagiug remark. We
r have knowin merehanurs deliberately
settling $25,000 of debt at forty cents
I on the dollar, selling off the stocks of
goods aill investing in real estate 'for
speculation the sixty cents of their
debt stolen from their creditors. Is
this hoiAt? It has become a recog
t nized ieans of escaping finaincial
,difliculties. Tom, Dick and Harry

Farmers, sustain the honor and the
1 integrity of the' farmer; pay your

I every acre of your homestead. We

S esty that calls stealing "settlelllments."
Let your v'eights and your mieasurel

Swronig, that every obligation should
