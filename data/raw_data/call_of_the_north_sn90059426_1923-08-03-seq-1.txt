NATION MOURNS DEATH OF OUR PRESIDENT
COMMUNISTS
ADVOCATE VIOLENT
REVOLUTION
Convincing Documentary Evidence
Submitted as Proof.
We submit to our readers docu
mentary evidence that reveals the
hand of revolt which never rests.
When we sit quietly back and let the
world go by the enemies of America
are working with feverish speed and
beastly fiei’ceness to destroy our Con
stitution and Government. It is time,
that every citizen awaken from his
sluggish indifference. Read and be
convinced that the hour has struck
calling Americans to action.
Program and Constitution of Com-
munist Party of America.
“The Communist party will syste
matically and persistently propagate
the idea of the inevitability of and
necessity for violent revolution, and
will prepare the workers for armed
insurrection as the only means of
overthrowing the capitalistic state.”
“The proletarian state, like every
other state, is an organ of suppres
sion and coercion, but its machinery
is directed against the enemies of the
working class.”
“By the use of force the proletariat
destroys the machinery of the bour
geoise state and establishes the pro
letariat dictatorship based on soviet
power.”
“The revolutionary epoch which the
world now has entered forces the pro
letariat to resort to militant methods
—mass action, leading to direct col
lision wjh the bourgeoise state. Mass
action culminates in armed insurrec
tion and civil war. This can be noth
ing else but a direct struggle be
twee the armed forces of the capital
istic state on the one hand and the
armed forces of the proletarian rev
olution on the other.”
THE PROLETARIAN STATE.
“Capitalism will perish very sud
denly in the South, when the black
helots arise. It is our business, we
white I. W. W’s, to provoke this ris
ing, to organize and direct it, so it
does not waste itself in futile blood
shed, but sets up a new society after
it destroys the old.”
Indusrial Worker.
September 30, 1922.
AROUSING NEGROES TO RE
VOLT.
“Who can read the news from
Washington and not feel that the
time has come for men verywhere to
raise the banner to revolt. The old
parties are but creatures of a worn
out and rotten economic system.
. . . The country is astir waiting
the signal for revolt.
August 9, 1922.
WILL BREAK LAW GLADLY
“If the I. W. W. is forced to break
the law, it will do so gladly and joy
ously. It will and must express the
discontent of labor.”
Weekly Industrial Worker.
February 24, 1917.
DENOUNCE THE CLERGY.
“The clergymen. Why should we,
workers, care whether the clergymen
starve and worry? Have they not
always been the contemptible tools
of a criminal master class? Have
they not always resisted us when we
sought to lift ourselves and our fel
lows out of the mire of poverty, igno
rance and oppression?”
One Big Union Monthly.
January, 1920.
WIPE OUT DEMOCRACY, THEY
SAY
“We do not need to find another
word for ‘Socialism’ in this country,
but w'e must certainly wipe out the
word ‘democracy’ from our vocabu
lary. Instead of ‘democracy’ the
‘Dictatorship of the proletariat,’ that
is our only and immediate demand.”
International Weekly.
January 3, 1919.
FLAMING CROSSES RING
MALDEN CEREMONIAL
A huge circle of blazing crosses
illuminated a great naturalization
ceremony which was held by Malden
Klan, Realm of Missouri, a few nights
ago. Klansmen from all sections of
Southeastern Missouri were in at
tendance. Malden Klansmen served
thousands of guests with a splendid
barbecue supper. In this section the
Klan has met with stubborn opposi
tion by un-American elements and
the wonderful gathering was re
garded as a great victory for Amer
ican principles.

CHARTER OF ATLANTA
KLAN IS SUSPENDED
Source of Past Klan Troubles
Revealed
The charter of Atlanta Klan No. 1
has been suspended by General No
than Bedford Forrest. Grand Drag
on of the Realm of Georgia, on ac
count of the fact that this Klan has
persistently failed to pay its Imper
ial, Realm and Provincial dues. The
suspension became effective July 10
and as the result its offices are auto
matically vacated and no members of
Atlanta Klan are permitted visiting
privileges in other Klans of the na
tion. The Klan while suspended is
not entitled to any representation at
any Klan meeting, district, state or
national.
Atlanta Klan No. 1, since it was
organized, has always disregarded
the payment of dues. Because it was
the original Klan of the nation and
because it was located in Atlanta for
mer national administrators had over
looked the fact that this Klan was
never in good standing and permit
ted them not only to continue in ar
rears but actually granted them spe
cial financial privileges from the na
tional treasury at the expense of
other Klans.
The administration of Dr. H. W.
Evans, however, declared that At
lanta Klan must be subject to the
same rules as other Klans of the na
tion and that they were entitled to
no special consideration. He request
ed that they pay their dues just like
the rest of the Klans. This attitude
made leaders of this Klan bitter
toward the present national adminis
tration and they have been trying to
stir up internal strife within the
ranks of the Klan. They are to a
great extent responsible for all the
’“ecent litigation.
Repeated attempts to make At
lanta comply with the constitution of
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
having failed, there was no other al
ternative for their own Grand Drag
on but to suspend their charter. This
action was not taken until ample op
portunity had been given them to
comply with Klan regulations, but
Dr. H. W. Evans refused to discrim
inate in their behalf.
Klans of the country, under the
constitution of their order, are for
bidden to receive as visitors any
member of this suspended Klan.
“THANK GOD THE
KLAN HAS COME”
Aged Woman Sees Great Need
A Village in Southeastern Minnesota*.
I arrived here with information
about the place which would indicate
that no Klansman could expect a
welcome in this village. Although a
certain element was very unfriendly,
in fact bitterly against the Klan I
found some people who could not see
good reasons for preventing an open
air Klan lecture and their better
judgment prevailed.
So I went to the Park Board and
was permitted to advertise “Twi
light” Orn’s lecture for the park.
One member of the Park Board was
a kindly old lady. When I told her
I was the advance man for a Nation
al Klan lecturer, she said, “Thank
God the Klan has come. I sit on my
front porch and look out into yonder
park and see things that would break
a mother’s heart. Certainly, you
may have my permission to use the
park. I only hope you will get
strong here so that you can make my
town a better place to live in.”
From what I have learned since
coming to this town, it is a fact the
Klan is needed here even more than
the lady member of the Park Board
is aware of.
MISSOURI KILLS NEW
ANTI-KLAN MEASURE
The Missouri Constitutional Con
vention on July 10 defeated the fourth
consecutive measure to be presented
before it which sought to eliminate
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The
latest anti-Klan measure to be pre
sented was defeated by a vote of 42
to 14.
The other propositions aimed to
prevent the operation of the Klan in
Missouri have been killed during the
past few weeks.

KUNCARS WANDER
EAR FAR ASTRAY
Klan Officials Have Fun Finding
Meeting Place.
St. Paul, Minn.—St. Paul and Still
water klans combined in a peppy
open-air meeting in Washington
county on Monday night and burned
a 28-foot fiery cross preliminary
to the program. Klansmen from
Ramsey and Washington counties
flocked to the field and a healthy class
of candidates was introduced for in
itiation. Everything was ready for
the push-off when it was discovered
that the state officers and the speak
ers of the occasion were missing.
Where were the missing men ? All
sorts of conjectures were rife, with
visions of ditched cars or other calam
ities floating in the minds of the
throng.
Meanwhile, how fared it with the
missing potentates? The situation
would have been comical if it had not
been exasperating. The truth of the
matter was that the officiary and its
guests were lost! Mile after mile was
covered by the swiftly moving klan
car, but as only two of the missing
men had ever seen the meeting place
before, and then under unfavorable
conditions, it was guess-work with
them as to the right route. Every
branch road looked alike; landmarks
on which they had fondly fixed their
hopes were either marvelously miss
ing or appeared with astonishing dup
lication. After sundry wrong turn
ings information was sought from lo
cal residents with the result that
about two hours after the appointed
time the long expected car was sight
ed, heading across the wheat fields for
the still-burning fiery cross. The pro
gram was resumed, candidates were
welcomed, bundles of the new state
newspaper were distributed and snap
ped up eagerly by news-hungry loyal
ists. The speakers enthused the as
semblage with their reports of the
great progress made far and wide by
the klans. “Old-timers,” veterans in
the state program, told of the unex
pected realizations of the past year
and the meeting closed in time to per
mit every klancar to reach home by
midnight. Such open-air affairs are
held regularly by St. Paul and ad
jacent klans.
Three hundred aliens were natural
ized into Sheffield Klan, Realm of
Alabama, a few days ago. Thousands
of people watched the ceremony.

STILLWATER RUNS DEEP
A Peppy Open Air Meeting Held
in Washington County
Stillwater Klansmen met last
Thursday night in their own klavern.
In spite of the fact that a pouring
rain started at 7:00 p. m. and con
tinued until 9 p. m., a large percent
age of the members were out and
took part in the naturalization of a
class of earnest, alert Americans who
came to learn the mysteries and fel
lowship of the Invisible Empire.
The Stillwater Klan at this meet
ing made arrangements for another
naturalization ceremony to take place
next. Week. Plans for the state Klav
ern were considered carefully and de
cided that Red Wing or Fairmont or
Austin or Owatonna were not to
have things one way when it comes
to offering inducements in the selec
tion of the big state meeting of
Klansmen.
CANBY HEARS
KLANSMAN ORATOR
Many People Sincerely Seek to
Learn More About K. K. K.
Canby, Minn.—About two weeks
ago two men came to our little city
and reported themselves to be of
ficials of the Ku Klux Klan. When
these two men were asked to produce
their credentials they did so to the
satisfaction of all interested.
The town was billed advertising a
free lecture. That evening about a
1,000 people estimated by the number
of information cards given out,
gathered and heard splendid lecture.
Even the people who were expected
to be prejudiced admitted that the
Klan lecturer said nothing to arouse
class or group strife. In fact every
body was very much surprised in that
newspaper storiees had givn many
an entirely wrong impression of Klan
principles, aims and ideals.
A Klan organizer is now at work
here and has found people here in
goodly numbers who see the great
N need for this militant, protestant,
Christian, American organization.
Albany, N. Y. —Attorney General
Sherman, it is said, has decided that
something much stronger than- the
Walker act will be necessary to un
mask the Ku Klux Klan. For pur
poses of prosecution, he has decided,
the law is useless.

L K. I. RESTRAINED
Injunction Against Knights Granted
in New York.
Albany, N. Y., July 26 (Associated
Press) —Supreme Court Justice H. D.
Hinman, Wednesday granted the ap
plication of Deputy Attorney Gen
eral Griffin for a temporary injunc
tion restraining the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan, Inc., and the Kame
lia, Inc., from exercising the powers
delegated to them under certificates
of incorporation issued by the secre
tary of state.
The basis for the application was
an allegation that the certificates of
incorporation had been changed be
tween the time they were approved
by Supreme Court Justice Pierce of
Buffalo, and their presentation to
Secretary of State Hamilton.
JESUS OF NAZARETH
The lecture, “Jesus of Nazareth,” is
an argument with the new theology.
The speaker closed the Bible and con
fined his discussion mainly to a con
sideration of Jesus in His influence
on music, art, modern literature, and
his authority in the universality of
the Christian calendar. He likewise
referred to the universal celebration
of Christmas.
KLAN LECTURERS
WELL RECEIVED
No Real Objections to Klan and
Klan Lectures Found
Klan lecturers have been holding
open air lectures over the entire
state being well and enthusiastically
received. In only three towns of the
state have lecturers been denied the
right of free speech. All press re
port? point out the deep impressions
left by Klan speakers. Common
statements are: “The lecture was so
different from what expected,” and
“We can’t understand why there
should be any objection to the gospel
of Klancraft.”
Although the mayors of Spring Val
ley, Redwood Falls and Lake City
have taken a stand against a Klan
lecture in their respective towns,
they will accomplish nothing. The
battle is on and no officious official
can refuse to grant Constitutional
rights. The Ku Klux Klan believes
in free speech and will fight a legal
battle with every person who tries
to deny anyone the rights safeguard
ed by the basic laws of the land.

CYCLOPS OF
KANSAS MEET
A Large Number of State's Most
Distinquished Citizens
Attend
Wichita, Kans. —Klansmen from all
parts of the state assembled here
last week at the state meeting of the
exalted cyclops. Never before, it was
declared, was there such a splendid
gathering of distinguished Kansans.
The dawn of a new era in the state
was prophesied as a result of this
meeting of the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan, who through their mem
bership in the order are devotedly
pro-American in all things relating to
their citizenship.
Stirring Resolutions.
Stirring resolutions were passed.
The resolution endorsing the adminis
tration of Dr. H. W. Evans, imperial
wizard, was passed with much enthus
iasum and proved another blow to the
enemies of the order, who have been
hoping against hope that an inside
row would develop from the attack
made on the head of the order recent
ly by a few malcontents. Indorse
ment of the oath, the present con
stitution and laws, support and co-op
eration to George McCarvon, imperial
repi’esentative of Kansas, and a
pledge of loyalty and support to the
state of Kansas and the governor
thereof and all constituted officials of
the law likewise received favorable
consideration and were unanimously
approved by the attending members.
A concluding pledge of loyalty and
respect to the Constitution of the
United States of America, which in
cludes all of its amendments of the
specification that violation of the
eighteenth amendment of the same on
the part of any Klan official will be
punished by banishment forever with
out fear or favor, was strongly en
dorsed.
Strong Representation.
Ninety-five per cent of the organ
ization of Kansas were represented
by their exalted cyclops or field rep
resentatives, notwithstanding that the
state is in the midst of its harvest
season, the busiest time of the year
for he whole state.
The consensus opinion was that
never before was a state meeting held
where there was such a uniformity of
purpose and such decision manifested
to abide by and conform to the con
stitution and law’s and the authority
consituted herein. And never before
was there so much progressive and
constructive legislation enacted upon.
