sprang to their feet crying “Mr. Chair
man !”
The Mr. Chairman, in this case, was
Charles A. Walsh, of the Hearst pay-roll,
and Charles was not taking any chances.
Charles was obeying orders. Those or
ders were to the effect that the “plat
form” should be jammed through, un
changed. Vainly the Independent dele
gates to the Independence Convention
clamored for recognition. Debate could
not be permitted. Discussion must be
shut off. Brother Walsh neither saw the
frantic gestures, nor heard the strident
“Mr. Chairman!”
With the help of those Chicago things
and the rest of the pay-rollers, the plat
form was jammed through, according to
orders.

Saffold and the Bryanites.
While Mr. Watson has no choice be
tween “the Twins,” and wouldn’t turn on
his heel for the difference —Bryan or
Taft —he deferred to the preference of
his native state, and OFFERED TO DO
ALL IN HIS POWER TO INSURE
THE ELECTORAL VOTE OF GEOR
GIA FOR BRYAN.
But the Hoke Smith element of the
Democratic party was determined not to
be robbed of the advantage of charging
that “Watson is working for Taft”;
therefore they refused the'Watson prop
osition which would have made the state
safe for Bryan.
Judge F. H. Saffold, and thousands of
others, believed that Mr. Watson’s offer
was just as fair as any man could make.
He did not believe that we should have
strife in Georgia when such a magnani
mous effort for peace was being made.
He thought it unwise in the Demo
cratic Committee to suffer itself intimi
ated by the Atlanta Journal —Hoke’s
organ.
Therefore, Judge Saffold entered his
protest, setting forth manfully the rea
sons for the faith that was in him.
And now the Committee, amid the
shrewish scoldings of the Journal, has
demanded Saffold’s resignation from the
electoral ticket.
SEND IT IN, FRANK—SEND IT IN.
Let the vengeful partisans of the Journal
type wreak their small spite, and have
their little way.
The old Pops will remember it, and
will remember Hoke, and remember
YOU.

No Picture of the Goat.
Will some enthusiastic Bryanite explain
why it was that no snap-shot photograph
was taken of the scene when Bryan and
the goat gave that exhibition on the Oma
ha stage?
Bryan “the Peerless,” Bryan “the
American Gladstone,” Bryan “the Ameri
can Cicero,” drew a very large sight-draft
on the admiration of his followers when
he consented to appear before that audi
ence in Omaha, leading a goat about on
THE JEFERSONIAN.
the stage of the theater. The draft ap
pears to have been duly honored, but the
followers have been mighty quiet about
it. Apparently, they don’t invite other
drafts of the same kind.
The Jeffersonian would have given a
fairly good mule to have seen the face
of that goat while W. J. 8., “the Glad
stone of America,” was towing it across
the stage.
As to Bryan’s face, we know how that
looked —and our lively mental picture an
swers every purpose.
But why no photograph of the scene?
Bryan dearly loves to have himself pic
tured, and the gallery of photographic
views is a long one—but surely it was a
deplorable oversight not to have ko
daked Bryan and the Omaha goat.
Dear Bryanites, please tell us why we
have no picture of your Cicero and his
goat.

Bryan and the Labor Vote.
Samuel Gompers is an honest man, and
a good patriot, but he is no lawyer.
Neither is Mr. Bryan a lawyer, al
though that was his profession.
But Bryan has become an expert in
political machination, and the manner in
which he gold-bricked Samuel Gompers
at the Denver Convention was worthy of
“tricky Dave Hill.”
The Injunction plank of the Denver
platform means nothing. Every lawyer
who knows his business will tell Mr.
Gompers so.
Is not the Immigration question more
important to Labor than the question of
Injunctions? The Injunction game is
one that two can play. If Mr. Gompers
will engage the services of first-class law
yers, keeping them on his side with an
nual retainers, he need not fear the Van
Cleaves, and the Baers. Thele are judges
and judges —why does not Mr. Gompers
fight his devil with fire? Where there’s
a will there’s away, you know, Brother
Gompers.
The idlest of fancies is this thing of
supposing one can obtain relief from
oppressive conditions by declaring against
them in the political platform of a party
which is the most notorious pledge-bust
er known to American history.
Mr. Gompers knows the record of the
Democratic party, and he knows that it
can not be trusted.
But if Bryan is such a friend to Labor,
why does the Denver platform say noth
ing against European immigration? Why
does it confine its opposition to the for
eign laborers who come from Asia?
Asiatic immigration is not troubling
the East, the North, the South, nor the
Middle-West.
Only the Pacific slope is vexed with
that problem. As a bait to the hook
which he is dangling before California,
Washington and Oregon, Mr. Bryan puts
into his platform a clause opposing “Asi
atic immigration.”
But what about the hordes of European
paupers that are pouring into the coun
try?
What about the sweepings of the
slums of Italian cities that the steamship
companies are dumping upon us? What
about the Hungarians, the Poles, the Rus
sians who are swarming over the seas,
in legions vaster than® those which
trooped after the war horse of Attila?
Mr. Bryan is ostentatiously seeking the
vote of Labor —yet he leaves the Tariff
system standing in all its glory, and
EXCLUDING FOREIGN CAPITAL
FROM COMPETING WITH AMERI
CAN CAPITAL, and leaves the door of
European immigration standing wide
open ADMITTING TO OUR LABOR
MARKETS MILLIONS OF CHEAP
WORKMEN WHO ARE TO BE
USED BY THE BAERS AND VAN
CLEAVES TO BEAT DOWN THE
WAGES OF AMERICAN LABOR.
What about this, Brother Gompers?
What about it, Mr. Bryan?
Your platform favors the protection of
the American Capitalist from the compe
tition of European and Asiatic capital,
but does not favor the protection of
American Labor from the competition
of the European immigrant.
How about it, William J.? You are
begging the farmers for campaign boodle,
when there isn’t a line in your platform
that even so much as promises them relief
from cruelly oppressive conditions.
And you’re the vote of
Labor when you didn’t even have the
courage to offend American capitalism by
mentioning European immigration.
You’re a team, William J. —You cer
tainly are a whole team.

“The Democratic party was founded
