(CONCERNING PUNCTUALITY.
SDeIng Moatly Ia Conltlaint About
People WVho Are -"Too Previou.."
Tiresome as the guests are who spoil
a dinner and keel, all their fellow
guests waiti:g twenty minutes longer
than tneessuary. thus prolonging the
dreary before dilnner interval. I think
one feels even moInre exaspl) .ted, from
a host ss' poinlt of view. with those

feelings.
Who does not know also those lain
fully early risers wiho will get up long
before breakfast. to the annoyance of
housemnaids and their own discomfort,
who greet their host and hostess with
a reproachful "We have been down
some time!"
Then there is the fussy host, who
speeds his partlui guests half an hour
too soon to catch ia train, thus inflict
ing on his victims a long wait at a dull.
drafty station till they are bored and
tired before they commence their jour
ney.
Life is too short to spend so much of
It in unnecessary waiting as is done by
these "too previous" spirits and the
unfortunates they drag in their train.
Punctuality does not consist in always
being too soon for everything, as those
householders seem to think who keep
their clocks habitually ten minutes too
fast. The happy knack of real punctu.
allty is a royal gift, the outcome of
forethought and kindly -consideration
for the feelings of those with whom we
have to do.
As it has often been remarked that it
Is never safe to count upon our deaf
friends being always dullt of hearing. In
the same way it is not wise on all oc
casions to reckon even on the most con
firmed habit of procruastination. Dila
tory people can and will sometimes un
expectedly bestir themselves, like a
bride Whose relatives so impressed up

VIGOROUS PROTEST.
Objects to Torpedo Boat I)esi royer Going
Through the Dardanelles.
Constantinople, Jan. 7.-Great Brit
ain vigorously protested to the Turk
ish government against the pcrmissic:i
granted in September last to four un
armed Russian torpedo boat destroy
ers to pass through the Dardanelle,
into the Black sea under the commer
cial flag of Russia. These vessels arc
about to start on a proposed trip. The
British note says the passage of th:
Dardanelles by the torpedo boat de
stroyers will be a violation of existing
international treaties, and that if Rus
slan war' 'ps are thus allowed to use
the Dardanelles Great Britain will re
serve the right to demand similar
privileges. The protest has caused
irritation in Russian circles and con
cern on the part of the Turki-h ai
thorities, who fear the other pow'rs
will follow the example of Cr,:at Brit
ain.
TRULY A MIRACLE.
An ElecqtrIan Hin. aI 11ounderitl Etcap
f-om 'a Feear' iate
New York, Jan. 7.--To be jammed
under the pilot of a hog locomotive, as
the ones CornelHts Vanderbilt invented
are called, to have his legs curled over
the axle wheels under the polit and be
carried along for 100 feet and yet es
cape without broken bones, has been
the experience of Louis Hysler, an
electrician at Mount Vernon.
Hysler was found with his legs
curled around the axle of the wheels.
His head was jammed back under the
pilot itself. He was in a position that
made it impossible to extricate him
without lifting the locomotive from the
rails. When he was finally removed.
Hysler's left knee was found to be dis
located, his right knee bruised and his
leg cut. He also had some cuts on
his face and body, but not a bone
broken.
SECRET NATURE.
Nothing (iven Out as to the Meetfag at
Nt. Louis of Railroad Employes.
St. Louis, Jan. 7.--The meeting of
u3v delegates, representing the Broth.
erhood of Railway Trainmen, and the
Order of Railway Conductors of west
ern roads: to ask for a 20 per cent in
crease in wages, was of a secret na
ture and just what has been accom
plished is conjectured. Railroad offi
cials say that no overtures were made
to them today.
President Ramsey of the Wabash. on
leaving for New York, said that up to
the time of his departure he had heard
nothing from the trainmen. The dele
gates, representing all trunk systems
south and west of Chicago, are by ap
pointment, meetsag the general ma.a
g-rs of these roads in respect to the
ultimatum presented Dec. 30 last ask
ing for a 20 per cent increase in wages.
The organizations are working to
gether- for the desired increase and
the committee are recognized by the
railroad officials.

KILTED TAPE LACE.
tirely new and original work. hand
made. not ditficult to produce and very
strong.
The materials required are good nar
row tape or braid and very tine crochet
cotton, with a strip of thick brown
glazed paper. which is better if used
double.
lhe first two patterns are composed
of the best makes of twill tape, the
narrowest width. The next pattern is
made of the narrowest plain linen tape,
which is little more than half the width`
of the twill tape.
In Nos. 4 and 5 the patterns are
formed with very fine French braid,
the width of the plain linen tape, al
though when worked it looks wider,
being easily stretched. This braid
looks softer than the tape. The finest
crochet cotton should be used for all
connecting stitches and best sewing
cotton. No. 100. for sewing the plaits.
Irur the scallop pattern in No. I pre
pare a strip of paper the length re
quired and two inches wide; make a
chain of crochet the length of the paper
anid tack upon it about a quarter of an
inch from the edge. Next prepare the
kilting. Make twelve very small plaits: t
sew them at one edge with a very fine
needle and cotton No. 100; it should
have three stitches to each plait, and
between each set of twelve leave a
space about three-quarters of an inch,
which must be folded to form a point
between each scallop.' When sufficient
sets are ready, tack them in position
upon the paper, and make separate
pieces of kilting for the upper part of
the pattern: allow half an Inch plain at
each end. Make twelve plaits in each,
but fold each plait half way over the
next, so as to' make it look full when 1
spread out: tack these on,. leaving the 1
ends of tape just tucked over the chain 1
to be hemmed down when the paper
'is removed; then, using very fine crochet
cotton, complete the pattern with needle I
point stitches. Commence with the I
imlf wheel, unite the point of the outer
kilt with the chain.
Next work double buttonhole stitch
into the under fold of the upper kilt;
three rows will fill the space, but at
the third row, between each double
stitch, turn the work round, and put a
double stitch to attach the upper edge
of the lower kilt; then work three or
four rows upon the outer edge, observ
lIng the same rules.
The ingenious worker will be able to
follow out or obtain useful suggestions

The coffee w.4 weak, the toast burned
to a cinder and the ham as hard as
leather, or at least he said so. Hls
wife's long patience gave way.
"John Henry," said she, "I've tried
faithfully to cook for you for twelve
long years. No one in the town has
better cooked food, yet you are always
finding fault. Why can't you praise
me once in awhile? I'd like to know
that!"
He looked up in astonishment.
"Well if you ain't the most unreason
able woman I ever saw."' he ejacu
lated. "Why, many and many is the
time I've sat dow'n to a meal and never
said a word about it! Anybody would
know there wasn't any fault to be
found or 'I'd 'a' found it, and yet you
want a better compliment than that!
That's just like a woman: she can't
tell a compliment when she gets one!"
Indian Or dleeoakes.
For Indian griddlecakes put in a
large bowl half a pint of yellow meal,
a level zteaspoonful of salt and one
tablespoonful 'f sugar. Pour over this
one pint of boiling water, and, when
thoroughly mixed, add one and one
half cupfuls of cold milk. Let the mix
ture stand at one side until perfectly
cold, then stir in one cupful of flour in
which oneteaspoonful of baking powder
has been sifted, and last add two well
beaten eggs. Indian cakes should be
cooked slowly and thoroughly.
To "Do Up" a Veil.
To renovate a veil that is soiled, make
a lather of soap and water, simmer the
veil in it for twenty minutes. then
squeeze out the soap with the hand and
rinse'in clear water, to which have been
added a few lumps of sugar. Shake
out the veil and flap it; do not wring it.
Pin it to a clean cloth, and when dry
cover it with a handlkerchief and iron.
