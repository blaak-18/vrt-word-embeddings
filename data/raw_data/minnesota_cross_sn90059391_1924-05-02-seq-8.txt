RUN'S HEDY CROSSES
FUME THRU COUNTRY
Five Demonstrations, Two in Be*
loit, Staged by County-Wide
Klan Organization
BELOIT, WIS., April 21. The
“flaming cross” of the Ku Klux Klan
burned in a half-dozen places in
Rock county on Saturday night.
Two were burned in Beloit and
others were touched off in Janesville,
fihopiere and Clinton.
The country-wide demonstration
had the appearance of careful plan
ning and the match was touched to
the oil-soaked crosses simultaneously
promptly at nine o’clock. In each
Elace aerial bombs were fired just
efore the crosses burst into flames.
Flag Near Crosses
The biggest flaming cross in this
city was fired in an open field just
aouth of the Waterman public school
north of the Eclipse Homes addition.
The cross was about 30 feet high anti
Us flames shot many feet into the
air as they were fanned by a brisk
wind. A short distance from the
burning cross a pole had been erec
ted and from the top of this floated
the American flag.
The other demonstration in this
city was at McKinley and Roosevelt
avenues. It was perhaps 20 feet
The flame and the crashing of the
bombs caused many calls to the po
lice and fire departments but hians
men had informed the officials re
garding what was taking place and
no mlice or firemen were despatched
to the scene of the blazing crosses.
The demonstrations attracted big
crowds of churches specators.
Highway Is Blocked
At Clinton nearly the whole vil
lage was reported to have turned out
to see the phenomenon. The two
noisy bombs awakened those who
already had retired and others quick
ly flocked to the scene of the demon
stration. The Janesville demonstra
tion was near Highway 10 just south
of that city. The highway was blocked
by the automobiles of spectators who
■topped to witness the scene.
At Shopiere a dance was broken up
by the demonstration and the entire
village watched the cross burn for
thirty minutes or more.
It was believed the blazing crosses
were part of a pre-Easter demonstra
tion staged by the county Klan or
ganization. Klansmen said today
there are 2.000 members in this city.

Klan activities in Rock county was
