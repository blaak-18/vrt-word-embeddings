Summary of Events as They Happen
By TOM DOLAM
The Atlanta Constitution recently gave the
following facts in an excellent editorial that

parcels-post convention is to be arranged between
Canada and the British West Indian colonies, in
cluding British Guiana, gives emphasis to the
deficiencies in this respect of the United States
postal service.
“The United States now has parcels-post ar
rangements with many foreign countries, but none
at home.
“Packages weighing as much as eleven pounds
may be sent from any point in the United States
to the West Indies, Colombia, Central
America and elsewhere at 12 cents a
pound.
“Weighing a maximum of four
pounds six ounces, they may be sent
to Great Britain, Germany, Australia,
Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Japan and
to most points in China at the same
rate.
“But the rate within the United
States, though the distance may be
but ten miles, is 16 cents per pound
with a limit of four pounds.
“Here is a concrete instance: An
Atlantian may send by mail to Bogota,
Colombia, eleven pounds of merchan
dise in a single package for $1.32; if"
he wishes to mail it to Marietta, he
must make three packages of it, and
it will cost him $1.76.
“If it is such merchandise as is not
divisible separate packages, he
can not mail it at, all between points
in the United States should it weigh
more than four pounds.
“A system which, to say the least, is
somewhat incongruous, inequitable
and absurd.
“Here we are extending to foreign
nations privileges and conveniences
which are denied to our own citizens.
“The American postal service will
carry mailable merchandise half "way
around the world for 12 cents a
pound, but if it goes ten or a hundred
or a thousand miles at home, it must
pay sixteen.”
The establishment of the Par
cels-Post would knock the props
from the greedy, engorged and in
solent express monopoly, and at
the same time do away with much
of the loss in the mail service.
Nearly all of this deficit is cre
ated by the unbusinesslike policy
of literally subsidizing the rail
roads that carry the mail. Dr.
Emmanuel Pfeiffer, of the Postal
Reform League, calls the attention
of Mr. Taft to the fact that the
postal rate paid by the Govern
ment for carrying the mail is the
same as it was in 1878, even though
freight rates have undergone revision, and
the Interstate Commerce Commission is mak
ing motions as though these rates need a gen
eral cut.
Blaming second-class matter, such as maga
zines and newspapers, and Rural Free De
livery, with the deficit, is either superficial,
or a studied resolve to becloud the question.
The suggestion to increase the pound rate
to publishers is outrageous. If the postal
business of the Government itself were accu
rately reported, the loss in distributing Con
gressional speeches, campaign literature, in
the abuse of the franking privilege on the
part of officials, etc., etc., would run into the
millions every year. This burden is borne by
the patient taxpayer, who now is told that
his newspaper, or book, or magazine is car
ried too cheaply! By unchecked extrava
gance, and by prostituting the postal service
postal deficit and its remedy:
“Announcement that the Ca-.
nadian-English parcels-post rate
is soon to be reduced from 16 to
12 cents per pound, and that a
to carrying the partisan literature of the
party-in-power, and by diabolical favoritism
to the railroads, a deficit has been created,
and the public is threatened with increased
taxation to cover it!
Why can’t the mail be carried at a reason
able price, instead of at an exorbitant profit?
Why can’t the Postal Department show its
real transactions?
Why can’t a Parcels-Post be established
that would be beneficial to every one except a
handful of magnates at the head of the Ex
press Monopoly?
Why doesn’t Mr. Hitchcock turn on the
light ?

difficult to see how he could restrain a side
splitting, rib-cracking guffaw at the farce
pulled off by himself and the railroad mag
nates, in discussing alterations in the inter
state commerce law. And assuredly they
must have been vastly entertained at the idea
of the laborious consultation. If the Inter
state Commerce Commission is going to
amount to a hill of beans, it will proceed with
out allowing itself to be bamboozled, or
bludgeoned, by the railroad magnates, and if
it isn’t, it might as well quit its job. Pow

porations, and then politely inquiring of them

A most interesting new theory has been ad

bread from blame as an essential factor. This
new idea is that the disease is due to “the
chemic force of the sun’s rays”. In support
of this, it is pointed out that pellagra is a
disease peculiar to Southern Europe and
America and that nearly all its
victims are of the class who work
much under the broiling sun, and
with very little protection from its
burning rays. It is also suggested
that blondes—those whose skins are
fair, and unprotected by the pig
mentation which produces the
dark, swarthy complexion—are
most likely to suffer. The disease
is characterized by a reddened,
roughened, blistered skin, and in
fact its name is simply a combina
tion w r ord signifying “rough skin”.
The nervous symptoms are also
marked.
There can be no doubt of the ef
fect of light upon the human econ
omy. The influence of the sun’s
rays upon the development of the
eye is well known to students of
evolution, as well as it being a mat
ter of common knowledge that
moles, deep-sea fish, and other crea
tures of darkness have, and need,
no vision. Medicine is gradually
coming to understand that, while
air and sunshine "are invaluable to
health, some types, principally the
fair-haired, do not thrive if ex
posed too much to the direct rays
of the sun, and there may be hope
for the eradication of much pres
ent suffering in simple protective
precautions. Certainly if “sun
stroke” is possible in a few hours’
exposure to the intense heat, many
years of outdoor life, insufficiently
protected, may give rise to chronic
illness. Ordinary “sun-pain” is a
quite common complaint in the
South even among those who lead
indoor lives, and the relief afforded
i by a darkened room is familiar to
. all who have acute headache, etc.
Sunlight is literally a chemical
bath, and it will be interesting to determine
in what cases it will promote health, and
where an excess will do harm.
