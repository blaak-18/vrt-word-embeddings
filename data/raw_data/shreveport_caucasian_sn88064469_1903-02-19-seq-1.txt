CRAWFORD CASE
A Touching Scene Between Mrs. Craw
ford, Her Husband and Her Son.
The feature of attraction at the court
house has been the trial of Dr. G. B.
Crawford and his son, Dr. C. C. Craw
ford, of Loves Lake, Red River parish,
indicted for the murder of J. H. Vick
ers in the Manhattan saloon at about 5
o'clock on the morning of October f.
1902. On Noovember 1. 1902, the accused
had a preliminary before Judge A. D.
Land when Dr. C. 4. Crawford was dis
charged and Dr. ,. R. Crawford was re
leased a few days afterwards on a bond
o6 $2,ooo. At .he sitting of the grand
jury on January 6. 190io, the father and
the son were indicted for 'murder. Ehe
accused surrendered to Sheriff Ward on
January 20, and were jailed. The case
was called for trial \Wednesday and con
tinued to 'T'hursday owing * absent wit
nesses foe the defendants, and after
some legal delays the following named
citizens were empanelled and sworn to
try the case: W. .6. Marmer* B. 61.
Roach, !. W. Lununus, E. E. Hearne,
B. H. Norton, Jack McCain, Sohn E.
Murray, 0. P. Ogilvie. W. P. Nicholson,
Charles W'imbish, &,. 1 Harrison and
C. W.tory. District Attorney Land rep
resented the State, assisted by ! H.
Shepherd and M. C. Elstner. and the de
fendants by 1. M. Foster of Thigpen &
Foster, H. P. Wells of Wells & Wells,
and Maples & McDonald. It is in order
to state as a matter of fact that Mr. Elst
ner was not "the leading counsel for the
prosecution assisted by District Attorney
Land and J. Henry Shepherd," as has
beent reported in the Times and the Jour
nal. Such a statement is ridiculous and I
would leave the impression of a personal I
or individual prosecution with the State's I
attorney assisting. The district attorney
is always the leading counsel for thi
prosecution. s
One of the incidents of the trial was
the arrest of Tom Hardy, charged with I
attempting to influence jurors in favor I
of the accused.
On Friday there was an affectung scene
between the accused and his family. In t
the court house were seated< Mrs G. B. (
Crawford and her five daughters aged I
from five to fifteen years. and when the I
court was adjourned for dinier these 7
walked to where the elder Crawford and I
his son were seated. Dr. Crawford and t
his wife embraced and the children could 1
not repress their pent-up grief. The spec
tators were moved to tears while the
accused, almost speechless from emotion.
endeavored to encourage them and as- I
sure them that all would be well in the t
end.
The testimony was in substance as al- I
ready detailed in newspaper reports. Had
Dr. Crawford left his pistol at home he
would not have killed a young man who I
had done him no injury and would not
have been on trial for murder, and vet
this example of the concealed weapon t
will have little if any effect on some men
who do not consider it safe to go about I
in a civilized community unless they
go armed, and being armed with a con
cealed weapon are ready to kill and mur- i
(her on the first opportunit,.
They State presentation was clear an
forceful.
On behalf of the defendants it was in
evidence that Vickers held an opened
knife in his hand as he came from be
hind the bar to meet Dr. C. C Crawford
who had abused him outrageously, but
this witness was challenged by other wit
nesses. One strong feature of the de
'fendants was their effort to show that
Vickers after being "cussed out" by Dr.
C. C. Crawford, had tried to get into a
drawer where it was customary to leave
a pistol, but the prosecutioq demonstrat
e¢ that when Vickers was shot he was
unarmed nor was there a knife or pistol
found at his side or anywhere about the
body when it was first viewed and taken
away to Waring's to be prepared for
burial. The' defendants managed their
case skilfully.
In his charge Judge Land announced
that in defense of his son or his family
Dr. Crawford could shoot the aggressir.
This was the question over which the
jury wrestled.
After hearing the exhaustive charge on
the points of law and the verdict which
it could render, guilty, guilty without
capital puinishluent. or not guilty, the
jury retired to consult over their verdict
which was: C. C. Cra ifford not guilty.
The jury then retired to consider their
conchtsion as to Dr. G. B. Crawford.
On Sunday morning with the consent
and approval of the court and the attor
neys connected with the case the jury's
verdict was received, and to the sur
prise of the defendant and his friends
the verdict was guilty of manslaughter,
with €n ar.test recomnendation for
_The :wife ndtht daughtors of
0ed an
lanmntations. It was a pitiful. a sor
rowful sight.
On Tuesday afternoon a motion for a
new trial was submitted. the pleas he
ing that the verdict was contrary to the
law and the evidence; that in the room
occupied by the jury there were law
books from which sonic of the jurors
read; there was a newspaper from
which the jurors reaj¶ and that the jury
had been taken to Frank's Re-taurant
for their meals, and while there had
been served their meals by employes of
the restaurant, etc., etc. With these ex
ceptions the defendants attorneys ex
pect a new trial, and if denied will ap
peal to the Supreme Court. Each reader
may draw his own conclusion as to
these technicalities, but the Caucasian
without hesitation must commend the
action of the jury. The verdict was re
sponsive to the evidence and the law.
It is a fair ano correct verdict which
will receive the hearty endorsement of
all classes of the people not interested
in dte case or related to Ate accused.
WEATHER BULLETIN.
The Cold, the Warm and the Storm
Waves Forecasted
(Copyrighte* 1903 by W. T. *oster.)
St. Joseph, Mo., Feb. 14.-Last dlle
tin gave forecasts of disturbance *o
cross the continent February 16 to go,
warm wave 15 to 17, cool wave 18 to 22.
The next disturbance will reach the
Pacific coast about February 22, cross
west o fthe Rockies by close of 23, great
central valleys 24 to 26, eastern states
I expect this to be a radical disturb
ance of large dimension and that it will
pass along mid-latitudes affecting all of
the North American continent. The tem
perature will go high about the time this
storm center is on your meridian but the
high temperature will be of 'short dura
tion. The threatening day will be on
meridian 9o about February 25 and will
be of that peculiar kind that usually
precedes a blizzard.
The ternm -threatening" which I use
often may need some further explana
tions. If the storm center passes north
of you it will'cause hot weather and the
cool wave following will not go to very
low temperatures. If it passes south of
you the warm wave will not go to very
high degrees while the cool wave will go
to lower temperatures than usual. I the
storm center passes over you the warm
wave will be very warm and the cool
wave very cool.
W\'arm wave will cross west )f the
Rockies about February 22. great cen
tral valleys 24, eastern rfates 26. Cool
wave will cross west of Rockies about
February 25. great central valleys 27.
eastern states 29.
This warm wave and the roof wave
following will gi. to greatest extremes
along parallel 40.
The above extremes of a stornm wave,
that is the warm wave first. Yhe soarm
center following and the cold wave f3
lowing that will probably be a compound
disturbance, such as we had the Tast
days of January and first days of Feb
ruary and which was repeatedly an
nounced in these bulletins.
These great disturbances usually te
gin with a warm wave, a *>rm center
and a cold wave passing along the
boundary between the United States and
Canada. A few days Tater another com
plete set of storm elements pass east
ward about five hundred miles south of
the farmer set. Then comes the third
set passing about one thousand miles
south of the first.
In these compound or complex smrm
distu bances the first set of elements will
be a day or two earlier than my fore
casts indicate, the second set about on
time and the third set a day or two be
hind the dates indicated. I seldom miss
these great or compound disturbances. I
have not missed one of them for six
months, and you may count on one dur
ing last days of February and first days
of March.
The Fargo Forum says: "The Car
rington Record borders on the impos
sible when it intimates the public has
even less faith in the ground hog-than
in the weather bureau-oat weather pre
distions. Moral: Read Foster's fore
casts in The Forum," And in the Cau

RIVER FORECAST.
Arthur City reports fa t in Red river,
which is favorable for short duration of
flood in Arkansas.
At Fulton the further appreciable rise
will last about two days longer, and all

over thirty feet of water at Fulton.
At Shreve-ort a steady rise averaging
about one foot per day is expected dur
ing the next seven days.

WILLIAM R.HEARST
IS NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES
At Rally <a ffferson-Jackson-Linoclr
geague-Bryan's Bitter Attack on
Alleged Democrats Who Carry
Knives Up Their Sleeves.
A rally of faders of Democracy was
ield in Columbus, 0., on Thursday, Feb
ruary 12, under the auspices of the Jef
ferson-Jackson-Lincoln League, organ
ized a year ago by ex-Congressman John
$ Lentz and others. At this barbecue
rally there were twelve hundred invited
guests. William9 Bryan received an en
thusiastic ovation. In the course of a
bitter attack on alleged deserters from
the Democratic party he asserted that if
there is any one man in the country who
has suffered on accout of the lack of
Democratic harmony he is that man, and
charged that it was the opposition of al
leged Democrats within the ranks of his
party that brought him to defeat in 1896
and 1900.
He said that he knew all the men who
had gone astray in those years, and that
since that time they had suffered severe
heart-burning.
"If it is such a serious affair to change
party allegiance." Mr. Bryan said, "I
hope these men will stay out of the Dem
ocratic party. There can be no harmony
between Democrats who carry knives
for each other and hate each other.
There is a better chance to make Dem
ocrats out of Republicans than out of
Palmer and Buckner Democrats.
"These men can never be in harmony
with us, unless they or we change out
political convictions. * still believe in
the platform adopted at Chicago in
186, and in Kansas City in igoo. I have
no thought of surrendering my convic
tions. Our principles were true then;
they are true now. I would not change
them if I could. Neither would I surren
der my principles t~o win any victory,
however great, for my party. A party,
like a man, needs a character and a
membership that knows what is right
and will do it in the advocacy oi political
principles."
Mr. Bryan said tie dir no propose to
take his Democracy from any Demo
cratic teader who received his training
from Wall street.
Mr. W. R. Hearst, who had been in
vited to address the banquet, sent his
regrets in a telegram in which he said
in part:
"The history dt a country is really the
history of a few great nýn. In these
men are crystallized the country's real
life and worth. Theirs is the genius that
gives expression and reality to the con
victions and principles of the people
whom they represent. The three names
that you have chosen to be reverend in
unison are the greatest names in the
American people's history, save, of
course, the foundation game <! Wash
ington.
"WVashingtog stands apart. HIe tepre
sents the struggle against foreign su
premacy.
"The three gien wholr yot. meet to
honor are the representatives of plan:
and thoughts and beliefs of aie Ameri
can nation as a free nation.
"Washington made American self
government possible. but Jefferson.
Jackson and Lincoln directeO American
goveritnent into its popular democratic
channel Paid made it true.
"Until very recently. Jefferson. ck
son and Lincoln could possibly be called
typical of both of our great political
parties. All three of these men stood for
the rights of all the people, and their
views have been represented in every
great movement until these latter days.
"It can not he denied that today one
of the political parties has divorced it
self form American principles and from
these great American statesmen.
It is the duty of the Democratic party
to return the power of the government
to the people by allying itself with those
popular political forces best able to ac
complish that result.
"What force in the United tSates is
today most in harmony with true Dem
ocracy and best able to compete with
this financially organized usurpation of
government ?
"To succeed. the Democratic party
must work under he ispiatiotn of the
great names and thoughts of !efferson,
Jackson and Lincoln. And it must work
in co-operation with the organized man
hood and independence of this country,
the great Democratic trce of todty.'
At this gathering ex-Governor 3udd
of California nominated Mr. Hearst for
President of the United States in an ad
mirable address, in which he said:
t "The man who, in the fight when the
treasurers deserted you. came to your
!succor and stood an able lieutenant un
der your orders, the man who fought all
his life for a national eight-hour law,
for an income tax, for the national ap
propriations for schools, for the doc
trines preached by Bryan and the fath
ers; the man horn in our State, and a
native son, whom we regard as one of
the greatest of the times, is William
Randolph Hearst. congressman-elect of
New York.'
DR. J. L. MI. CURRY DEAD.
10r. J. L. M. Curry, agent for the
Peabody educational fund, died Thurs
day at Asheville, N. C. He was a great
and good man awl his death is a great
loss to the negro education in the South.
-Shreveport Enterprise.
The clipping quoted is from the En
terprise published by A. H. Samuels. a
colored man, in the interest of colored
people. He has well said of Dr. Curry
that "he was a great and good man."
And we may add he was a substantial,
earnest, sincere friend of the negro: a
better and a truer friend of the Negro
than Teddy Roosevelt. or Crumpacker
or Dr. Parkhurst and all the howling,
sanctimonious hypocrites at the North
who pretend to love the nigger. The
Peabody educational fund is the great
gift of George Peabody. who, unlike
Carnesie, distributed his millions for the
sake of humanity and not to advertise
himself in life and his name to poster
ity in libraries created and endowed with
reserved string attachments. Some day
the Negro will reach the full sense of
realization that his friends are not those
who, like Teddy, would use them as
cats paws to pull political chestnuts from
the red-hot furnace. The Negro can have
no better friend than the Southern white
man, whose feeling for him is kindlier
than was ever or can ever be entertained
by the white men at the North who sim
ply have a theoretical, a superficial idea
of his Mtature and his condition, his
weakness and his virtues. In the Souttl
no negro can starve or die from want.
He is offered every reasonable oppor
tunity for advancement and he is pro
vided with public schools in which ti,
educate bis children. The Negro cat.
have no better, kindlier friend than the
Southerit white man, with whom ?ie
played and fishe? and hunted when they
were boys.
