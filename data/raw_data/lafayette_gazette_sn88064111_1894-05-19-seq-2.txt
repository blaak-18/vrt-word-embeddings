i a ande Balanchard -will
.:.hime to replesent this State in
z.e : Untedr State Senate. The Leg
Waitue, recognizing the eminent
ty and appreciating the valuable
.ervices of these gentlemen, acted
.diely in electing them. The se
alnor Senator, although a new mem
i~np has a most brilliant record; he
has, at a most critical time, proven
to his coastitaents that in him they
lead c able and influential defender
of their right. He entered the
Senate only a short time ago, but
by his unquestioned ability, dego
lion to duty and characteristic firm.
segs, he soon won the respet of his
eother Senators and is now con
uetered one of the leading members
from the South. -The Junior Sen
ator, Mr. Blanchard, is equally as
deserving as his colleague, Mr.
Cafery, and in his election, which
is assured, the Legislature will only
carry out the popular will. He ,is
the choice of North Louisian, and
no fair-minded man will deny that
section the right of selecting one of
the Senators.
With Caffery, the polished
orator, and Blanchard, the expe
rienced statesman, in the Senate,
Louisiana's interests will be in safe
lands.

Gov. Foster's r-.ase to the
Legislature is coan ceded by the press
throughout the State to be an able
and statesmanlike docun.ent. It is
an exhaustive review of the condi
tion of the State, told in a clear and
comprehensive mannner. It con
tains many wise suggestiý;ns that
the Legislature will do wall to con
sider. He suggests to the Legisla
ture the granting of ii crtased ap
propriations to the Ir,s'iture of the
Blind, and Institute for the Deaf
and Dumb, the State University
and Agricultural and Mechanical
college, the State Normal School,
the Soldiers' Home and the militia,
The attention of the General Aasem
iily is also called to the Insa ne Asy
lum and to the Char'tv Htspit.:.
He speaks of the financial co.diti -n
of the State; the ass--snltnt ro s
for s893 showing an increase of
$15,73o,ooo over 1892. This is
indeed very ineouraging
The governor favors the repeal c f
that provision of the constitution
giving the right of voting to new
comers when they declare their in
fention to become citizens; the
educational or property qualification
to vote; the purification of the ballot
and he also urges the Legislature to
pass a law legalizing general primary
elections. He advises some very
desirable changes In the judiciary,
a modification of the justice of the
peace system to be replaced by a
minor criminal court in every parish,
thus doing away with the present
delay in bringing offenders to trial
and reducing the cost.
Prize fighting receives the atten
ion of the governor. He recom
:gtlls the enactment of a law to
]e favors the election of the
police jurors by the people instead
of being appointed by the governor.
RAILROAD COMNIlSSION.
SOf all measures that will be
brought before the Legislature of
-L-ouislan at its session commencing
.onday next, there is none that
;ilU be of more real consequence and
iimaortance tothe welfare and future
development of South Louisiana
tbhan that of the bill to create and
define the power of a Board of Rail
road Commission. That such a law
is absolutely necessary in this State
to regulate and guard against the un
just and extortionate trates for trans
trtation of railroad lineb, none can
deny, who have had any experience
or dealing with the railroad com
panles doing business throughout the
State. The people of this portion
>f the State are directly ianterested in
1e passage of such a bill and should
 .ke active and vigorous steps to
4ards ltasIn before the Legisla
4aaro seh imation and matter as

The Kiagdom of Home.
Let home stand first. No mat
ter how high your ambition, no
matter how far your talents or your
influences may reach, before every
thing else build up a true home.
Be not its slave; be its minister.
Let it not be enough that it is swept
and garnished, that its silver is
brilliant, that its food is delicious,
but feed the love in it. Then from
Its walls shall come~the true woman
and the true man.
Whathonor can be greater than
to found such a home? What dig
nity higher than to reign its honored
mistress? What is the ability to
speak from aJ public platform or
the judge's bench, Compared to
that which can insure and preside
over a true home? To be the
guiding star, the ruling spirit in
such a home is higher than to rule
an empire.
Says a correspondant; "Allen G.
Thurman, the old Roman, is at
home in Columbus, O., to anyone
who may. call. The house is a
double one. On one side live his
son and family. In the library on
the other side can be found almost
any sunny afternoon the man who
in his day was nearer the idol of
the Democratic party than anyone
since Andrew Jackson. Some one
started a story not long ago that
the old Roman was mereley existing
in a sort of blank atmosphere.
The story was cruely false. He knows
his race is run, of course,
and he seeks seclusion so far as his
opinions on public matters are con
cerned. Some of his neighbors
are Republicans. He respects
the-ir beliefs too much to indulge in
interviews which might - cause any
unpleasant relations. They know his
views; they respect them, for they
know the man's honesty of opinion
has an element of courage that is
rare." To the correspondent Mr.
Thurman said: "I am getting back
into some of my old habits. I used to
sit up late reading, until Mrs. Thur
man would come in and take the
book out of my hands and make
me go to bed. She broke me of
the habit. But since her death I
find I am getting back. And I sit
up long after they are all in bed,
but I sleep long after they are up.
I usually stay in bed until noon.
My principal ailment is rheumatism,
and, like all rheumatics, I dread
dampness and hail the sunshine."

began use of Electric Bitters and found re

adapted to cure of all Kidney and Liver

Advertising for Wives.
To the Editor of the Gazette:
We have of late oberved one or
two instances of this indelicate
practice, which is as gross as it is
absurd. The person who advertises
for a wife is generally either a very
idle, a very disagreeable or a very
worthless creature, for, he would
not adopt this means of introduc
tion, if he possessed accomplish
ments or merits to win a lady's
band by the ordinary way. This
practice is quite prevalent in some
countries and it is a most repulsive
feature, and should therefore be dis
couraged as much as possible here.
*0*
We will say for the information
of the good lady who wrote the
above that the advertisement which
appeared in The Gazette was in
tended as a joke and nothing else.
In justice to the "advertiser" we
will state that he agrees with her that
it is a most reprehensible practice,
and that he believes the "ordinary
way" the best and the safest to win
a "lady's hand."
A Rallroad Commission.
SRepresentative Julian Mouton,
from this parish, has introduced a
bill in the Legislature to provide
for the regulation of rates on rail
roads and to create a railroad com
mission. Speaking of this bill a
Baton Rouge correspondent to the
Tinies-Democrat says:
The peospetive legislation of
this, the thdd day Bf the session of
Y. is of j d
~inj~st. ai more spor:
bills -hieb .either intro
Uor of ch i ee of liten
Sto inaal webii gives, tmlight
be lmentioned the bill proposing the
establishment of a railroad commi'
sio,. The author of. the bill is Mr.
Mouton, of Lafayette, wh6 suc
ceeded Mr. Overton Cade, thlp pre
seat Superintendent of the Mint,
and who, though a new member,
has already given indication of no
little ability. His railroad com
mission bill provides that the Gov
ernor shai appoint from the State
at large three commissioners at an
annual salary of between; Saoo and
53o0o. Each of the commissioners
shall furnish a bond of $so, oo,
and their appointment shall be con
firmed by the Senate. In explana
tion of his bill, Mr. Mouton states
that his parish (Lafayette) has been
a sufferer from rates, both on
passenger and freight traffic, and
while he does not aim at the passage
of an act which will affect the growth
of railroad interests of the State,
he desires a readjustment of rates
so fixed by the commissioners that
the corporation may receive a fair
and equitable return on the capital
invested. The author of the bill
does not hesitate in sayng that he
expects some opposition to the bill,
but considers that as he aims at
justice alone he will be successful.
That the bill will meet with opposi
tion is unquestioned. Those who
are believed to be in favor of
leaving railroad legislation to future
hold that the time is not oppor
tune for the establishment of a rail
road comminssion; that the country
has just emerged from the trials of
a serious financial depression and
that any enactments that would
tend restrict the roads would operate
to the prevention of further rail
road construction. It is pointed
out that the railroads of the State
have made reductions of nearly 40
per cent in rates on sugar and
molasses, the principle products of
the State, and contention is made
that any further reduction would be
impracticable. As the merits of
the bill have not yet been discussed
in full, nothing can be said as to
its probable passage, but that con
siderable railroad legislation will be
placed before the Senate and
Hotfse is a foregone conclusion.
The Marshal's Answer to
Petitioner.
LAFAYITTE, LA., May 17 1894.
To the Latayette Gazette:
Will you allow me space in your valuable
columns to furnish your correspondent signed,
"A Petitioner," the information desired in
regard to the Stock Law.
To this I will say that the council itt adopt
ing the above ordinance didn't aim to punish,
nor favor any one in particular, nor did it
make any exception of certain stock, neither
the size nor sex. But in all laws, from the
severest to the mildest, there is, I believe,
some discretion to be used by the executive
officer appointed for the execution of the
same. In this case the marshal acting im
partially toward all, and somewhat in sympa
thy with the people to whom this law is a
hardship, believed it was no harm to leave
sucking calves or colts grazing out while their
mothers are kept inclosed. If your corres
pondent takes this opportunity to subject the
officer to his loving criticism, because I have
been too mild in the discharge of this special
duty I will, after this publication, inforce the
stock law as requested of your correspondent.
Pigs, hogs, calves, cows, colts, horses, none
excepted, even steers. So it will be useless
to cry for mercy.
The correspondent claims that he has
called the attention of the marshal to the
fact that some steers were roaming at large
in the streets and no attention was paid to it
by me. This assertion I deny; it is untrue.
Although I do not agree with Mr. A Peti
tioner in this case, I will endeavor to enforce
the law-and strictly-as requested

DIED.
At her residence in .afayette
May z , 1894, Mrs. rremmet
Plonsky beloved wife of Mr. L.
Levy. Born at Gollub, Prussia, in
x836, deceased emigrated with her
family to America in x86x, marry
ing, in x865, Mr. L. Levy in the
city of New Orleans, and at the
time of her death was the mother of
a large and interesting family of
children. Mrs. Levy came to
Lafayette with her husband in 587o,
and, by her steadfast maternal devo
tion and exemplary character, in
all her various social offices won the
respect and esteem of the entire
community. At last stricken with
a cruel and relentless affliction, this
good woman, after long and painful
suffering, was gathered home to Rest.
The remains were taken for inter
ment to Washington, La., and there
the last sad rites of the Hebrew
faith, were performed, Mr. Henry
Bendel officiating. The grief and
sorrow of the bereaved family and
relatives, manifested in a most
touching manner, the tender affec
tion which bound them to the de
parted dead. May the God of
Abaham, Isaac and Jacob, bind up
the broken hearts and sooth and
comfort the troubled spirits of the
afflicted family is the fervent prayer
of The Gazette.
Messrs. Joseph and Leon Plonsky
were brothers of the deceased and
Mrs. B. Falk a sister.
