SAYS JONES, SAYS HE.
The Arkansas Statesmans scheme
To Further Enlarge th; power
of Bfanks.
Washington, Jan. 25.-[Spec
ial.]-There was an exciting time
in the Senate on Wednesday. It
had been whispcred around the
Capitol the day before that the
next move in currency l gislation
would he taken in the ,Senate, and
all the newaper men were on the
qui vive. More than s score of
them came to me to ask what was
to be done, some called at my
boarding house to make inquiries,
but I told them that I was not fur
nishina news for goldlbug papers.
Early in the morning Senator Tel
ler called to me on the avenue and
asked what they were going to do.
We had quite a long talk for a
street interview. lie said lots of
things "not for publication," and
some that were. Among the latter'
was the statement that as soon as'
the scheme, what ever it was, came
before the senate, he should boldly
announce that "the bill Rhall not:
pass in this session." Then he
went on to say that he thought the
people would have a better chance
in the next congress than in this.
Now not one of the so called sil
ver democrats could be relied upon
to fight, but in the next congress,
when the republicans were in pow
er, they would help. Democrats,,
when in a minority, he said, made
very good reformers, but when in'
a majority, they were worth noth
ingsat all. Senator Teller thought
that the five silver senators and
Populists could beat the bill in
this session, if the goldites and
silver democrats did not all unite.
When the senate convened, the
gallaries were packed, and Jones,
of Arkansas, took the foor and
introduced his long-looked-for
measure. This bill has been in
formally under discussion in the
senate finance committee for the
last three weeks, and senator
Jones has repeatedly said that he
would not introduce it until he
was certain that it would pass.
That ts what gave importance to
the ocasion.
Contrary to the usua custom in
introducing a bill, he had it read
in full, and made a short speech in
favor of it. The bill provides for
the issue of $500,000,,00 thirty
year bonds, national banka to issue
to the full amount of the bonds
deposited, taxes toObe reduced to
on-fourth of one per cent, anad
one-half ofthe bankreserve to be'
bonds. The secretary of the tress-!
ry is directed toede and can -
cel and not re-isle the United
States and treasury notes when
ever and as fast a the aggregate
circulation of United States legal
tender ntet, treasury. moss, silver
oerticates aad atleao bank motes

a-mount these forum of pap.r
money in ireulataiom at the dat a~'
the passage of the act, and silver is
tohbereceived for coinage at the
mit at its bullion vale in Lon
don.
These was breathless attretim
while Jones read and explained his
,ilandthe aeetors crowded m
from the loak rooms rad filled up
the sits, La soon as Joe ato

to pay one-fourth of I per cent,;
which would be $250 on $100,000.
Then he is required to pay about
$150 to the department. The
two together make $4)0. He re
ceives *3,0(N) in interest, leaving a
net profit of $2,600 on every $100,- i
004). At that rate $500,100,000,(
would be a gratuity of $13,oU0),
000 a year without any investment.
They get the full amount of their
money back on depositing the
bonds, and if they use the whole
of the $500,000.000), which theyi
must do if they retire the green
backs and treasury notes, because
they amount to $500,1)00.00)0, when
that exchange is made it will ope
rate as a gratuity of $13,000,00(
a year to the banks without any
investment."
NATCHITOCHES, LA.,
January 29, i2195.
M$. EDITOR :-1 would like to
ask t:hose people who want pro
hibition, what they expect to gain
by it. Now, I live away up here
iin ward two, where there is not a
drop ot whiskey sold, although I
suppose many of my neighbors
bsometiumes keep a bottle on hand
iu case of an emergency. I do
myself. still, when I have'ut got
iL 1 like to think that when I go
to Campti or to batchitoches, I
cau at least take i, drinl, if I feel
like it. Ii'they pass this prohibi
bition ordisancu I. would probably
send to Coushatta or to some other
place for a jug. There ar3 many
others like me. And here is the
point I want to make, and I shant
take up much of your space, Mr.
Editor,
When the police jury submitted
the question to the people for a
vote, I happened' to be in town on
school business. At the same time
that this was done the school board
on which arc some mimbcrs of the
polic jury, discontinued all schools
in the parish for one month because
there wasn't any money in the
treasury. I thought this was fun
ny, and I wondered how our school
board could queti; discontinue
our schools for want of funds, and
then (some of them) turn around
and try to lopp off a large slice of
the revenues of the perish. What
was the purpose anyhow, -Mr. Ed
itor?
1)on't you think that .if our po
lice jury, containing some of the
school board meomb3rs, as I uid
before, had passed an ordinance
making part of the liquor licenses
available for the public schools
they would have done much better
and besides earned the gratitude of
the poor people of the parish I
think so.
Now, I want to ask my populisi
friends In Ward 9, (because I am
a populist myslf) if we have any
thing to fear from the sale of li
quoret As I msid before, there is
uace msael hem and hardly amy in
ward 8, our neighbor. And we
don't need prohibition to keep it
out. Now suppoe instead of help
oing ttohtitoutweask the po
lioa jary to tari over to the school
boad some .1 th revenues deriv
edal for Rlne g it. If we would
add this amount to What we al
ready have perhaps our schools
wouldat be loeed ol u at a time
whb3i we need them wre, sad
eihps too, we could have them
contiuldfor * longer time during
tiesyear.

would not now receive any umilage,
the revenue from whisky for one
ycar would pay the criminal costa
for three years. Just think of It!
Now, M.r. Editor, I ask you if
you don't think that it would be
better policy to uue this surplus to
imnnrove our puhlle schools rather
than lose it all? The first demand
of the Populists is for education;
ii requircs good schools to elucato
and ulcnty of money to run the
schools.
Let us agitate th3 question of giv
ing this money to the public schools
and when ever we find that our
virtue is gone and that we are be
coming a community of drunkards
we can talk about prohibition.
YWARD 2,
The Cost Of Ignoranoe.
Do you know why from IS61 td
1865 the United States was turned
into a slaughter house in which
men, not food animals, were butch
ered I Do you know why men
were industriously engaged in
burning the houses of their own
countrymen? Do you know why
an era of hate was inaugurated that
will lasi for a eentury ? You think
the cause of the war was chattle
tlavery, do you not ? Well, it
was not. The war was the direct
result of one set of ignoeamusee
electing another set to make laws
saad run the government for them,
Of voters net knowing whom to
elect and not caring so they elect
ed somebody that somebody told
them belonged to some party.
.Mlavery existed in Brazil but it
did not take a war to abolish it,
There were men in the north and
men in the south who, while differ
ing in their views of slavery, could
have settled the question without
loss of blood or treasure. These'
nomen were not the kind the people.
would vote for. They wanted
vomn fire eaters. They wanted
men with big mouths and no
brains. They got them and behold
the results. Had the north elect
ed a conress like Lincoln and the
.J uth Eleoted men like Stephens,
tnere would have been no war of
the rebellion. There is a crisis ap
proaching that is far more omni
ous than the late war and will be
far more momentous in its influen
nes. If the people had political
intelligenoe enough to eleot men
who knew how to handle it, it
would come like a spring morning
in flowere and gladness, but if
they do not, it will come like-
vell, like ignorncee always does
whatever it undertakes. Clouds
are gathering over this nation, but
ignorance sees them not.--Coming
