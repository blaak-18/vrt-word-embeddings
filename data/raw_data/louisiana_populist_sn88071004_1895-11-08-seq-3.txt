*in the strongest language, that the
t nomination was stolen from Judge

Young, the chief umpire in making
a decision in the matter, decided to
throw out certain ballot boxes be
eaume the fraud was glaring and
abowed itself plainly.
Since the friends of Gov. Fos
ter, members of the State Central
Committee, decided that the vote
cast at the boxes in question was
fair and aquare, and that they be
