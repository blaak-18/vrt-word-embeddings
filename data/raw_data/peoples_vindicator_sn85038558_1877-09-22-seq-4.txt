WHAT IS QUEEN'S DELIGHT?
Read the Answeir
It is a plant that grows in the South, and is spe- ti
cially adapted to the cure of diseases of that climate.
It is
NATURE'S OWN REMEDY, .t
Entering at once into the blood, expelling all srof- Itr
alous, syphilitic, and rheumatic affections. Alone,
it it a searching alterative, but when combined with
I Sarsaparilla, Yellow Dock, and other herbs, it forms
Dr. Tutt's Sarsaparilla -
and Queen's Delight,
The most powerful blood purifier known to medical li
science for the cure of old ulcers, diseased joints, foul 1t"
discharges from the ears and nostrils, abscesses, skin ,t
1' diseases, dropsy, kidney complaint, evil effects of
secret practices, disordered liverand spleen. Its use I
strengthens the nervous system, imparts a fair com- h:
plexion, and builds up the body with
HEALTHY, SOLID FLESH. 'i
As an antidote to syphilitic poison it is strongly p1
recommended. Hundreds of cases of the worst type p
have been radically cured by it. Being purely veg. ti
etable its continued use will do no harm. The best
time totake it is during the summer and fall; and nl
instead of debility, headache, fever and ague,you 01
will enjoy robust health. Sold by all druggists.
