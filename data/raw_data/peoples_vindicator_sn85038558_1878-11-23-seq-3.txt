SMACHME SHOP AND FouNDL.--Our
d enterprising eitisen 8. W. Kile, Esq., t
r doesn't talk long when be desires to es

Some Houses will not exchange

he Now that we amre on the eve of return
olug to our old market, New Orleans, it is
not t of placee to mention the fact that
oar business relations with Shreveport
have been most pleasant indeed. Gregg

Natchitoches is presented with oppor
tunities but seldom. When she is, we Ij,
sincerely hope that in future a widely r
different course will be presented front
that in the past. We were gratified to
see on our streets, wagon loads of cot
ton from Winn parish, and we have
been told that a number of farmers have is
been here from that section this fall,
with cotton. Vernon parish is coming la
also, and now that they do, let us also
do something to retain their trade. Good
roads and bridges are imperatively de- 2d
mauded, and we trust they are both in
such condition as to stand the winter 3d
rains, which must shortly occur. With
fair treatment and something like enter
prise on the part of our business men, the 4t
trade of the two parishes named can be
secured to us for all time. 4t
Parties desiring to purchase 5t
cheap and excellent goods both as
to style and quality will consult 5t
their interest by calling early at 6t
H. A. Walmsley's who has just re
turned from New York with a
stock fully equal to the wants of 7t
this section.
Col. G. W. MeCranie of the Ouachita
Telegraph, who fought the noble fight for
an honest constitution against "Stubbs 81
and his coterie," has this to say of the
result: 91
The Amendments have been defeated
straight out, as they ought to have been,
and scarcely a member of the legislature
who has been before the people for en- 10(
dorsement has survived the banter. They
are all gone down, and they all ought to 101
have gone down. They were elected to
redeem Louisiana, and were pledged, 111
as men seldom are, to make Louisiana a
State of Freemen. They slept on watch, 111
and the people have ordered they should
be shot. 121
The extent of the "Shooting" in Ous
chita was-For Stubbs (i.e. the amend
ments) 347 against Stubbe (i. e. for the 13
Onachita Telegraph) 1577. That is cer
tainly a handsome endorsement for one 131
of the "insignificant country papers." 14
J. J. MeCook & Bro., the "old
reliable" wholesaleana retail mer
chants of Natchitoches, have con- 15
tinued to maintain their prestige.
They carry an immense stock
purchased from . first hands tfr 16
cash, and offer superior induce- 16
ments to retail buyers, planters
and the trade. Merchants in the
interior will find on investigation 17
that this house can supply them
on better terms than they can se
core in New Orleans, St. Louis or 18
New York. They not only keep is
every line of dry goods, but deal
largely in fancy and staple groce
ries, wines, liquors, and tobaccoes. 'M
Their stock of boots and shoes is a
very heavy and being offered at
reduced gtpres.
Rwlv Ntws.--Old Red has dwindled
down to a mere "streak"' of very thin
water. Our lateat from below contains
th startling information that there is
bat 18 inches steamboat water at the

Freight rates, however, are high which

Stion from the fact that Captain Aiken

SMr, J. Alphonse Prudhomame has sus
tained a severe loss by the death of his
thoroughbred imported bull "Andover";
