VETERANS’ CORNER
CAN’T SEE TO READ IT, BUT CAN
HEAR IT READ.
Dear Sir: —I am an old Confeder
ate veteran; have been a subscriber
to the Jeffersonian three or four
years, and I don’t want to do without
it. I can not see to read it, but I can
hear it read. Find enclosed $1 for
the Jeffersonian for 1910.
Your friend,
JOB JANES.

A SOLDIER IN EVERY RESPECT.
Dear Sir: —I have been thinking
for some time of writing to you. I
want to compliment you on the bold
stand you have taken against For
eign Missions. It does my soul good
to read those grand and noble pieces
you write. I ask you as a brother
and a friend to continue to give
those preachers Hail Columbia as
long as the mercy and goodness of
the Lord permits you to live on the
earth. Oh, that we had more such
men as you are to tell them of their
own! What a grand old world we
would have to live in!
I can hardly wait from one week
until the next, because I want to see
what grand and noble things you
have written for me to read. I am
an old Confederate soldier, and nev
er had any chance of an education, —
could not write my name when I
went to the war. I married soon
after the war and raised nine chil
dren, five boys and four girls. Have
had a hard time in this old sinful
world, but was born of the Spirit (if
not deceived) in the year of our
Lord 1863, and joined the Baptist
Church. I am still a Baptist, but
the preachers call me a “Hard
Shell”. Brother Watson, I am glad
I am as hard as God’s word is, and
I believe you are as hard as I am.
Will say in conclusion that you
have done some of the grandest and
most noble preaching I ever heard
in all my life, and I pray that God
may give you grace and Christian
fortitude to continue the grand and
noble work until it be heard to
earth’s remotest bounds.
Your brother in Christ,

FROM A FEDERAL VET.
Dear Sir: —I see an article in your
late issue in regard to pension abuses.
I expect that I am losing time by
writing this, as I expect you know
more about this matter than I, but as
I have served in the Union army, I
was in a position to know of what I
am about to relate.
During the conflict between the
North and the South, nearly twenty
five per cent, of the Northern army
consisted of Roman Catholics, all of
which got from $5 to sls to enlist.
Soon as they got the money, they de
serted, changed their names and en
listed for another county, and if they
were likely to be caught would run
into Canada or cross the lines and
join the Southern army. About
seventy-five per cent, of all the Cath
olics were deserters. Here is where
our noble President Lincoln made
his great mistake, when he pardoned
these scoundrels and gave them an
©be Jeffersonian
honorable discharge. Soon as they
could obtain the discharge, they
flocked in on the pension roll and
from that time on have drawn the
largest share of the pension money,
and if you will hunt up their war rec
ord you will find this to be true, and
if you wish to cap all this, just visit
the soldiers’ homes. You will find
them there by the thousands, and if
you want to see a lot of drunken
beasts, you watch them a week or
two. Os course, the priests owned
and controlled the United States
Treasury, as they do now, hence they
see to it that their subjects get the
biggest slice of the pension money,
and it is still going on and will con
tinue so long as they hold the reins
of our Government, or as long as we
continue putting such men in office
as we have now. I hope to hear from
some of our Union veterans on this
subject. Let us make it hot for them,
boys.
AN OLD UNION VETERAN.
(J. Perry, Astor Park, Fla.)
AND THIS FROM CONNECTICUT!
I am living on land that was taken
up from the Indians by my ancestor,
who was the first white settler in
town, in 1663; and it has never been
out of the family name —good old
Puritanical stock, and Abolitionist
from the word go; and a more mis
guided set of people I guess never
lived. But they have had their day,
and now tEe Socialist and Single-
Taxer are the biggest fools out.

Answer.
Well, well, WELL! Brother Ayer
writes like a man whose hair is red.
He is the owner of a high-class stock
farm, and makes a specialty of Hol
stein-Friesian Cattle.
He is not far wrong about the
Abolitionists; and if he had said the
same thing about the slaveholders,
he wouldn’t have missed it much.
They were terribly misguided, when
they left the Union, before the Aboli
tionists had committed THE FED
ERAL GOVERNMENT to a violation
of the Constitution. That is where
my own ancestors made their strate
gic mistake. True, certain Northern
States had nullified the Fugitive
slave law, had established the “Un-

a “bleeding Kansas;” but the Fed
eral Government had not taken any
steps toward emancipation.
I have always contended that the
States had the right to secede, be
cause some of the parties to the com
pact had violated its terms; but it
was not good policy for the South to
withdraw from the Union, just be
cause a sectional and minority
President had been elected. The
wiser course w r ould have been that
which was advised by Alexander H.
Stephens, “Wait until Lincoln vio
lates the Constitution, before you
secede!” That was the counsel of
the “Sage of Liberty Hall,” and he
was right. T. E. W.
