April 11th, 1895.
I H. L. Brian, Editor PoruwIrT,
Natchitocles, La.:
Dear Sir:-After respects to
r yourself and family, I must say
that I regret very much that you
. have been forced, for want of sup
,. port to your paper, to adopt the
"patent side."
Under the present state of affairs
* it is indeed discouraging to those
who undertake to hold up the ban
ners of this righteous cause, by
s giving their time and talent (we
have little money to give) to its
propagation, to find their efforts
00 seemingly so poorly appreciated.
If the movement in this State
ever succeeds, they must learn to
support it more liberally. No re
, form of any consequence to the
" people was ever accomplished with
out great sacrifices, but when the i
common people, in whose interest '
the present movement was inaugu
y rated, manifest a disposition to
a force a few to shoulder the burden I
of such sacrifices, it destroys much
of the force the movement would I
otherwise have.
I sincerely hope that ere the
campaign opens up in real earnest
you may be made able by Popu- 1
1r lists coming up manfully to your
by help, to again publish both sides
of the Poruuur at home, and in
a- the interest of our party.
Until the people can be educated
m up to that point where they can
r recognise that the support they
a give to the advancement of this
*t movement is laid out as an invest- t
ment in a treasure which is beyond
the power of the moth to eat or of
time to corrode, I must say to e
n- you, though reluctantly, that we e
id will participate in many a hard c
I: fought battle without suecess-aye
k- many of us will see the sun in the o
r- rosy west for the last time before e
It the banner of "equal rights to n
Sall," under which we have aligned n
i- ourselves to fght the idolatrous h
worship of the "golden calf," shall ii
I- loat proudly over "the land of li
i, the free and the home of the 0
a brave."
It may be that old Father Time, a
with sickle in hand, will cut to the a
ground many of the pioneers of a
this grand movement against wage
h slavery and industrial depression,
d but as sure as the earth rotates up- h
on its axis, when we have been laid r
r to sleep in the dust from whence m
we sprang, and the petals of the hi
tlowers that deck our graves un- f
I fold themselves to the morning s
i breses., the good work we have a
done for God and humanity-never "'
dying-will add to the sum total of ly
r the eforts that shall bring victory.
The movement may be retarded al
I but eanotbe stopped. The prin- CO
ei aples upon which it is founded are hl
Setersal, and therefore cmannot die.

its A most deplorable shooting af
rts fray occurred fifteen miles below
this place on Friday, the 12th
ite inst. The parties were Elize Ra
to chal and N. B. P. Rachal, the lat
re- ter was killed instantly, having re
he ceived the contents of Elize Ra
th- chal's shot gun in his breast. It is
he impossible to give any definite par
et ticulars in regard to this sad affair,
ý. as all reports prove so conflicting.
to The deceased was 48 years, 1
en month and 2 days old; was the son
ch of Seraphin Rachal and Zelia Bros
Ild set, both dead. He leaves four
sisters and many relatives to mourn
he his untimely end, to whom we ex
st tend our deepest sympathy in their
u- bereavement.
nr May the great God above be
es merciful to his departed soul, in
in that hidden world beyond the
grave, from which "No man re
turneth." A FRrEND.

is I was struck by a comment in
i the Nonconformist last week that
the editor made to a correspond
ent who could only pay for his pa
per six months at a time, to the
to effect that it showed men in pov- I
re erty would spare a few needed
.d cents to read the truth. There is
one man, a shoe-maker in a Mas
re eachusetts city, whose name I will
l not divulge for the safety of his I
e employment, who 1s sent an order
o nearly every week for months to
d me for bookes and papers, in sums
of 25 to 50 cents. He writes me
he has only averaged $1.92 a week c
II in wages for a year! He is single, $
Of lives in a garret, does his own
n cooking, and spends 50 cents a
week for literature to educate his
brother workers to vote themselves
, out of this hellish bondage! There's a
e sacrifice for you. No cause with
d such unselfish, heroic advocates
can fail.
How many men in Louisiana
have made anything like such sac
d rifices as the above for the reform t
e movement We know of a few,
* but only a few, the majority of re
formers seem disposed to wait for
some one else to do the work. Get
a hustle on you boys, and we can
r swing this State into line very easi
r ly next Spring.
The only reason other States are
I ahead of this in reform work is be
. cause reformers there have worked
a harder and more of it.
Reform papers must be circula
a ted, and especially those published
a here at home, for who ever heard
I of any party accomplishing a vic

Read Mr. Bailey's letter in aa
Sother columa, and see something
I of the trials sad bardens of an edi
I tor in this reform movement, then
'go and exercise jusot half as much
'patriotism and get up a club of
subribers and send it in.
Don't delay it, we must get in
our educational work right away if
we would win.
The big bridge hbetweaen New York
and Brooklyn, the greatest in the

Frs Farmers impoverished!

The Republican party being the
author of the legislation which
produced the sad results cannot be
af- expected to remedy them.
)W The Democratic party having
th put the iniquitous schemes into ef

The new Silver party cannot per
feet an organization, and reasona
bly expect to down all other par
ties the first year of its existence.
g Especially when there is already a
1 thoroughly organized party in the
field flying the Silver banner.
The agitation of the Silver ques
tion among the Silverites of the
r Republican and Democratic par
n ties may weaken partisanship and
ir broaden patriotism for future use
fulness; it may cause a few State
Conventions to incorporate a 16 to
in1 ratio plank in their platforms and
i thereby hold political power in
such states, but it will never get a
clean cut 16 to 1 silver plank in the
National Platform of either of
those parties.
And the politicians know it, and
in the people are ready to believe it.
d The People's Party is the only
a- political organization that can hon
Sestly promise a clear cut silver
r- plank; it is the only organized par
ty that can promise better laws and
is better times; its representatives in

h Mr. James Collins, a brilliant c
young capitalist, of Atlanta, has
publicly announced his exit from
the Democratic party, and his ar
rival at Republican headquarters' on I
the pie and protection schedule. (
Hon. S. McClendon, a corpora
tion lawyer of Thomasville--ac.
cording to Mr. Curtiss-has sud
denly discovered that the State
Constitution adopted way back in
1877 renders "negro domination" d
impossible in Georgia, therefore .t
° the land lies fair and open for two b
parties in this State. g
Having recently discovered there
is Mna danger to white supremacy,
1 Mr. McLendon swings himself on
I the outside of the "organizsed."
Mr. Collins wants pie and says
so, while Mr. MeLendon repre
seats great monied corporations
which want protection. The Re
publican party can feed the one
and protect the other. Theefore
it is perhaps natural thst these es
timable gentlemen should gravi

But what ean the merchant wbo is

To go from the Democratic par
