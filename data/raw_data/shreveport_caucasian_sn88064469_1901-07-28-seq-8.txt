SEIXAS MONUMENT
Unveiled and Dedicatea by
Woodmen of the World.
Beautiful and Impressive Cerc
Inonial--Broadaxe and
Naple ramps.
Hon M S Shepard of Texarkana,
te Orator.
1'he biabtiftl and iipressive ceremonial
of dedictihn and unveiling a menument
of a deceased member of the order was
periormed by Broadaze Camp in conjunc
tion with Maple Camp, the two local
Forests of the order in this city, on Sun
day, july 21, 1901.
What loyalty to their obligations, what
devotion to their craft, what respect to
the memory of their departed dead must
pervade the hearts of man who will mar, h
miles to a ccmetery under lowerinr skies
and driolog rain, and devoutly fulfill the
promises made to the Lrother while living
that he should not lie in an unmarked
grave.
This is the only fraternal organization tc
day, that places an imposing monument at
the grave of every deceased member. The
monument does not cost the family any
thing, nor does it come out of the insur
ance. It Is absolutely tree, and stands at
mute evidence of the high esteem in which
every true Woodman is held. Can a mor,
beautiful sentiment pervade the heart o,
man? Can a more inspiring lesson be
taught mankind than to units the wer!d il
a common brotherhood, teacning them thai
the protection cf the home and family ii
the highest aim of existence, second only
to heaven? Can the unite mind conceive
of any more appropriate manner by whiob
to recognise the tealty, steadfasteese and
devotion to principle, which we have the
mute evidence of is the silest moeoliths
steading at the head of every Woodman'.
gravnI Thousands of bereaved wives
mothers, daughters, some and brothers
throughout the world today are protected
by this noble order and bless the day when
wooderaft was instituted.
The order of weodcraft is young in
years, but a giaut In strength. It stands
today, preven by its own great works, to
be one of the grandest social and fraternal
organlsataeas the world has ever sees.
The relatavee of the deesased sovereign
were eseerted to the cemetery in oarriage,
and witneesed at the grave the beautiful
ritualistie ceremony in honor of their
sacred dead.
