Who Is Safe in the Commu
nity?
The deplorable death of George 'otts,
lortman, and T F Whitworth, lineman, why
were In the tmploy os (lumberland Felt
phone Company, whi:h occured Thursday
at about 2 p m, on the Texas plank road,
bhas impresser' the ubiic with the real rz -
tiod of the danger of the electric wire
when It is left without protect on for
s fety.
'Ibhe two ii n wtre strluging a telephone
wire across the plank road, opposite
et gtne house No. 4; both were relisble.
cautious and experiencid. Foreman I'ottt
was on the pole and Lineman Whitworth
on the ground when the telephone wire
became connected with the current of
electricity generated for the use of the
cars of the electric ra.lwav. In an Instant
Potts was killea and a moment afterwards
Whitworth was liieless.
Mr Potts and Mr WhltwJrth were young
men and married. Both were held in toe
highest esteem by all who knew them,
Upon whom must re.t toe responsibllity
for the death of these two young men, may
be dete mined herealter.
According to the statement of Mr
i'owell, manager or the Cumberland delc
phone Company, the phone wire "became
connected with the current of electricity
by means of the spat w.re and did not rest
or touch the trolley wire."
In explanation of the accident Mr
Levinson, superintendent of the Shreve
port Belt faillway Company, is quoted as
naving said that "this wire," (telephone)
"probably slipped uown the span wioe
from being handled and pulled until it
came in contact with the t.olley."
At any rate two good men have been
killed; two widows and orphans mourn
the sudden death of their husband and
father, but beyond the responsibility for
their death, what proteoeton is offered the
publlo? Who can tell when a similar
accident may be repeatec ?
SVe nave demonstrated through the
columns of the Caucasian the necesetty of
safe guards, all in vain, and time and
again, when we have Inesited that the
telephone ware a h uld be protected from
contact with the trolley wire. Some people
have deelared, "he's cranky." And the
same criticism has been the result ot
urging the aseesity of the enforcement of
the ordinance relating to "fire escapes."
The last is that life is and has always
been too cheap. "What is a man's lilt? To
his wife and ehilaren, to his mother and
relatives it is beyond price, but what
oncern Save the great, busy peeple over a
dead man-a stranger to them. Dead
today; a few regrets by friends; to
morrow out o' sight ad thea out o' mind
sad soon torgottes. And, this no doubt
ios It should be, since it would be uc
natural to dwell always In toears and
lamentation, but after all, there Is a degtee
of responsibility resting on a city, its
oietals and its citisens from hich none
should shriah, andt that duty is to afford
the greatest possible safety to the publio.
Who can t.il when a phone wire may
lip ti break tIr m Its fastenihg aLd fall on
a trolley wire, with one end dangling in
the street or sidewalk? And what w uld
be the fate of the human being who would
become eater gled in it or touched tals
'deadly wire ?"
It all the wires, "phdae end trolley,"
were safeguarded there would be htt'e
risk, but the people take the risk and only
shudder when they stop to think and to
consider the rdesult of an accident as
deplorable as it is shocking-w.ilob re
sulted in the death of to )oung men who
were in the lull vigor of life.
There should be a most thorough inquiry
Into the cause of this aocident and let the
blame or responsibility rest where it
should, without tear or laver.

A TOKEN OF FRIENDSHIP
Resoltione Adopted by the Board of Direc
tors of the Shreveport Matual Build
iag Associatios
It is with earnest and deep-felt regret
that the Shrevepert Mutual Building
Association Directory notes the death
Sr its late oolleague, Mr H H Hargrove.
He was a faithlul mamber of our Board,
devoted to duty, an actige worker Is
promoting the success of our Asseciatlol.
He was one of our meist efcient dtrec
tors, energetic in its promotion and one of
our soundestreasoners. No one was more
faithful to the cause and his business
acumen and disciplined business judgment
was recognised by all, and Its lack bas
been felt by all inoce his death.
eocielly, hie relations with us were
pleasant and hi association y enial to the
extent of admiration and Irlendahip by
one and all of those who met him around
our Directory Bard.
Ktes lved, that the above is an expression
of our sentiment for our late associate,
Mr H/ H Hargrove, uttered in tue plain
language of true manhood.
Resolved lurther, that we extend to his
family our deepest sympathy, hoping that
the hand of JHm who notes even the
sparrows' fall, may deal, with His rentlest
touch,soothingly with his loved ones left
behind, and heal with loving kiss their
bruised hears.
Resolved, that these expressions be
spread upon our minutes and a copy sent
to our colleagne's family as a token of our
esteem and Irlendship.
