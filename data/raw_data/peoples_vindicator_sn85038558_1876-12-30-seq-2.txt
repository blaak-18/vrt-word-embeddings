The Last outrage
'"I.eking the stable after the horse o
has been stolen," is very poor com
fort to those who are the losers, but
we can at least fx the responsibility
of the last ontoage upon law in our
midst. The killing of Mr. Alex.
Onrus, and the wounding of Mr. m
Jehnson, has its responsibility in the
offiers of law who are charged wjtlh a
the preservation of the pe.ac of so
ciety, the lhavs and property of its
tctisens.
