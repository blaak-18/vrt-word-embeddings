* KEZIAH'S FATE.
Will He Be Hanged? No! Hei Will Be
Reprieved.
The Supreme Court having aflirmed
the verdict of the jury and the sen
tence of the court through w hich John i
Keziah is condemned to hang. the nat
ural inference is that he wvili he execut
ed in time, but it is safe to say ,that
Keziah's neck will never be encircled I
with the hangman's rope. He will have
the death warrant read to him. but the
penalty will be commuted and he will
be shipped to the pen- at Baton Rouge t
for life. which is in reality only fifteen
years. There was a time when legal t
hangings were in order, hut there is al- e
way; the ready plea for commutation, c
and then the hangman is therefore '
cheated of his job. But why hang Ke- I
ziah when others, not negroes. who de t
served to be and should have been n
hanged have escaped the rope? After U
all, Judge Lynch is the only authority n
from which there is no appeal. The sen
tences so decreed are carried out and h
executed without sentiment. a
ROOSEVELT AND NEW OR
LEANS. c
According to published reports, citi- a
zens of New Orleans would rejoice in
a visit to their city by Mr. Roosevelt.
The Caucasian can not understand why
New Orleans should offer an invitation
to Mr. Roosevelt. Because he is Presi
dent? Is he not traveling in his per- I
sonal and individual capacity, on a po- \
litical campaigning tour, in the inter- ti
est of his nomination for president? If e
he were traveling in his capacity of r;
President of the United States it B
would be in order to tender him an in
vitation and the recognition due his S
high office, but he should expect no
special request to come to a city which
is opened wide to politicians of high
and low degree from every section of C
the world. If in his touring Mr. Roose
velt should condescend to take in New 51
Orleans he would receive the welcome =
which New Orleans can give, but it is I
our private opinion publicly expressed a
that New Orleans' self-respect can be s
best maintained by leaving Mr. Roose- tI
velt to take such a route as may best
stbserve his plans and political
schemes.
It should be sufficient to say that MIr. e
Roosevelt is not Mr. McKinley. e
STREET PAVING.
The action of Mayor Querbes and the
council in devising the ways and means
through which to secure street im
provements is commendable in the high- A
est degree. Street paving means better
streets, and a city's progress may be n
measured by the local pride of its citi
zens. Shreveport is a progressive town,
.. d therefore must move onward. It is
true that the paving of streets is costly,
but there is compensation in the in
creased valuation of property on the
streets paved and in the satisfaction of
travel over such streets. While there is
some opposition to the paving of some
streets, it. is the Caucasian's opinion
that an overwhelming majority in num
ber and in valuation will be recorded s.
in favor of the bond issue at the elec
tion which is to be held on May 12. n
In such an undertaking, in such an en- li
terprise, no citizen who is concerned in
the development of the city, in the in- i
crease of property valuation can afford
to be penny-wise and pound-foolish. a
RIVER AND WEATHER.
This morning opened fair.
Temperature: Minimum 55; maxi
mum 76. a
River: Arthur City 9.2 feet, a fall of
0.2; Fulton 21 feet, a fall of I foot;

Outlook is still favorable for protract- e
ed fall at Shreveport.
Weather forecast for Shreveport and
vicinity: Tonight and Thursday in
creasing cloudiness, probably thunder
showers and cooler Thursday.

Co)mmittee to whom was referred the

froum Texas avenue to overhead bridge
over Vicksburg, Shreveport and Pacific
tracks reported as follows:
Shreveport, La., March 30, io3.--To
the City Council: We have examined
the records carefully and up to the pres
ent time find northing which disputes the
claim made by the Bernsteins of the
ownership of a certain portion of Mur
phy street.
Po sibly in the careful searching of
the records, which must be a part of the
making of the official map authorized
hb you last Monday night. something
may he found which wIjll prove the city's
ownership of the property in question.
\Ve do not. however, think it would
he equitable and just that the taxpayers
at large should hIe made to pay for the
paving of this street through the disput
ed territory in order to secure a dedica
tion from Bernstein Brothers. Espe
cially when the other property holders
are anxiotus to dedicate and pay their
pro rata also. Very respectfully
ANDREW QUERBES,
WILKIE WOODARD,
R. G. PLEASANT.
\Adopted.
By Mr. Snyder
That Murphy street be -aved from
Texas avenue to overhead bridge over
Vicksburg, Shreveport and Pacific
tracks, provided property owners on
either side of said street dedicate suf
ficient land for street and pay their pro
rata for paving. Adopted.
