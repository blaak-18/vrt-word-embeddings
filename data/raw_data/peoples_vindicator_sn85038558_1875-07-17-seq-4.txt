The publio journal mostly deserving of
Democratic suenpport is the one that, in

h bidea sometimes sought to be inclca

own in doing so that the people must go
taside their party organ to "find the
news,"' is absurd and Irrational. There
isno tsort of incompatibility whatever
between the political and non-political
journal as to the matter of news; many

hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
the political and socialeshams by its
masterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater success than
before, and was recognized as the ablest
and brightest of its class. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Oats

unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be
