The election to vote a 5-mill c
special tax for water works takes i
place to-day. Every one should ,
vote for the tax, first because we
stand sadly in need of the water
works, and secondly because the
tax is to be used in building the
same, and not donated to some cor
poration, which will speculate off
us, as is so often the case.

The whiskey election comes offe
Monday next in ward 4, the town 1
of Provencal and this city. Ii
The election in this place and n
Provencal will be illegal, and will
probably be thrown out because w
confined to the incorporation in- b4
stead of the entire ward. t
But notwithstanding this, every B
man who loves the peace and pros- l
perity that we have enjoyed un- B
der prohibition, should go to the ci
polls and record his vote for its b
continuance. Every merchant in a
thus city can attest its value to u
the actual necessities of the peo- tl
ple by his increased sales of such e
necessities; our railroad can and
does attest it by its report of in
creased traffic in such things, and
all of our people attest its value to
society and good government.
Of course we do not blame those
who are prepared to have lucra
tive professions legalized by whis
key licenses, for advocating it, but
as they are nearly all now engaged
in useful occupations, we do not
feel obliged to humor them.
Vote against licenses.

DIED:
IIHYAMS--()n Tuesday, Nov.
17th, at 11:1, a. in.. E. L. HIIYAis:
aged 2' years, 11 months and 7
days.
Deceased was the oldest son of
our esteemed Clerk of the Court,
Mr. II. M. Ilyams, and was an
exemphlary and popular young
man.
It is sad that on the thresh-hold
of manhood one so well qualified to
till important stations in life with
credit to himself, his country and
admirinL friends, should be snatch
ed away almost without warning.
But an all-wise God knows best,
and "doeth all things well."
The funeral procession was one
of the largest we have seen ita
Natchitoches, and with the deluge
of flowers that covered the coffin
and the grave, attested in part the
large esteem in which he was held
here.
lie was buried with military
honors, Co. I., of which he was
2nd Sergeant, heading the proces
sion to the cemetery and firing the
usual salute over his grave.
The entire community sympa
thize with the bereaved family and
friends.
We advise good Democrats to
amnse themselves while the Mc- 4
Kinley bazoos are being tooted, by
a study of our local fight. Don't
fail to remember that we convert
ed the Republican majority of 4
1200 of last April into a Demo
eratic majority of nearly 700 on
November 3d. We feel under ob
ligations to the Populists for this
result.-Vermillion Star.
Yes, this parish (Natchitoches)
was changed from a majority of
56 for Pharr, by Democratic count,
to a majority of over 1600 for
Bryan; Grant, from a majority of
1900 for Pharr to over 700 for
Bryan, and many other similar
changes, all due to the Populists,
but the Star is the first Demo
cratic paper that seems to feel
under any obligations to them for
their patriotic work.

You'll Laugh
If You Read
C
This funny and instructive book
tells in a most humorous way how
the Angel of Liberty took Grover
Cleveland from the White House
in the dead of night, and left him,
ragged and hungry, in Oklahoma
City, to tramp home. Grover's
trial's and tribulations as a tramp
are most ludicrously related, and
his conversations with farmers
and laboring men about the silver
question are very instructive.
Everybody Should Read It.
It contains 176 pates of laugh
provoking matter, and 40 full-pare
illustrations of Cleveland as a
tramp.
