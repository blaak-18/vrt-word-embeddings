TO NEBRASKA POPULISTS.
Since 1896 the Bryan men have
been in possession of our party in
this state. We have been unable to
do anything because of the gavel rule
used by those men whereby we were
kept down. Mr. Tibbles, in “A Sup
pressed Populist Newspaper,” tells
the methods in plain language where
by we were defeated. Our last leg
islature, however, passed a direct pri
mary law and we now have it in our
power to nominate straight Populists.
There has never been a time but that
the majority of Populists in this state
were in favor of middle-of-the-road
action. Now, since we have it in our
power to control our party, let us do
so. One man, Mr. A. W. Potts, of
Stockham, has filed for presidential
elector on the Watsop ticket. Let
every Watson man go to the polls on
September 1 .and cast his vote for Mr.
Potts. See to it that all other Popu
lists with whom you are acquainted
do the same and Mr. Potts will be
nominated. The lowest conservative
estimate, placed by Democrats and
Republicans, for Watson in this state,
is thirty thousand. Let us nominate
Mr. Potts and in November make that
vote at least fifty thousand. Do not
forget the date of the primary, Sep
tember 1. Write me and send me
names of Watson Populists. Funds
are also needed for distributing lit
erature. Yours respectfully,
ALLEN L. POWELL.

ATTENTION, COMRADES!
The Jeffersonian would be glad to
have brief letters from all’parts of the
country, telling us what the Pops are
doing. If we knew our own strength,
we would have more confidence.
Don’t wait for the National Com
mittee, nor the State Committee.
CALL A COUNTY MEETING
AND START THE BALL TO ROLL
ING.
If you have no county chairman,
let a volunteer act. SEND OUT A
CALL, ADVERTISE IT WELL, IN
VITE SOME LOCAL SPEAKER,
AND GET STARTED.
Bryan may have killed our party
in the West, but he has not killed it
in the South. And if we can poll a
million votes in the South, Bryanism
will lose its hold in the West, and
1912 will witness a genuine reform
movement that will unite the two
great agricultural sections against the
predatory capitalism of the East.
Now that Bryan has gone over to
the Wall Street element, and has
written a platform which is nothing
more than a blurred imitation of Taft,
it should be possible to resurrect the
reform movement which Bryanism
and fusion buried.
ALABAMA POPULISTS.
All Alabamians who believe in the
principles of Jeffersonian Democra
cy, and desire to support Hon. Thos.
E. Watson, the greatest advocate of
those principles, for President of the
United States, are requested do send
their names and address to the~Tin
ersigned at Opelika, Ala.
We want Alabama to give Mr.
Watson a good vote in the November
election, and we can not hope to do
the greatest amount of good unless
we organize. Act quickly, for our
time is getting short.

ANNOUNCEMENT.
The Rome meeting will not be held
on September 25, as previously an
nounced, but for several reasons it
was deemed best to give this date to
Powder Springs. Mr. Watson will
speak in Rome later and the date
will be announced as early as it can
be determined upon.

SOMETHING TO BE DONE.
The New York World has sprung
a sensation upon the so-called demo
cratic leaders in this state that ap
proaches the dimensions of a scandal.
The charge is made that $20,000 was
received from Thomas F. Ryan by
the managers of the Parker campaign
to influence W. J. Bryan to support
Alton B. Parker for president in
1904. Bryan denies it. Jim Dahl
man, who acted as national commit
teeman for this state in that year,
says he got the money but there was
only $15,000 of it and he used it all
in trying to elect George W. Berge
governor. Berge denies it and says
he paid his own campaign expenses.
If Dahlman got the money, he never
reported it as required by law, in
making his official report of the re
ceipts and expenditures of the cam
paign.
It all goes to show two things, viz.:
The “interests” were supporting the
democratic ticket in 1904 and that
Jim Dahlman is not a fit man to
figure conspicuously as a factor in a
reform movement.
“Jim” has been a very close friend
of Bryan. If he (Bryan) is going to
associate with such men, take them
into his confidence and hold them up
to the world as his political advisers,
he’ll be judged by the company he
keeps and treated accordingly.
The writer of this article has
known Jim Dahlman a long time and
has-no hesitancy in saying that a po
litical party that puts such men for
ward as its spokesmen and exponents
of its policies, is driven to hard
straits.
If the democratic party can’t shake
off such barnacles it is not and will
not be in a position to make any
headway against the republican par
ty, the recognized champion of rep
rehensible methods and corrupt poli
cies.—Custer County Beacon (Broken
Bow, Nebraska).
I heard a woman make a democrat
ic speech at Colorado (Springs on the
13th of July and she spoke of the
right of suffrage as “the sacrament
of citizenship.” If all men and wom
en who are entrusted with the ball.it
would regard it as a sacred thing, we
would have a better government.--
