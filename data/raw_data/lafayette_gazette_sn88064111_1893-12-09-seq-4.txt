Stvanished, the victim is bowing to a (
rose-tinted beauty from the West side i

Ins forgotten. 1
A young man with gsid-rilmed eye- I
glasses, a bi l necktie. Prince Albert
coat and a nonchalant air steps aside C
from the bustling throngand earnestly i
gazes into a haberdasher's window
where s1.50 shirts are displayed with f
tempting 95-cent, tickets on them,
while four-in-hands of variegated hues
hang in dazzling rows from brightly
polished steel rods. The young gentle'
man's gaze is intense and ftled.
In a moment l messenger boy plips
to the young man's side. While mix
ing peanuts with his wad of chewing
gum he also looks fixedly toward the.
object of the young man's vision.
Then a laborer stops and, after glanding
curiously at the two, puts his lunche
box down on the grating and concen
trates his vision on the curiosity of the
moment. And now the crowd begins
to grow by twos and threes. Fashion
ably-dressed women join its circle nun
til at last a bustling policeman and a
newspaper reporter rush wildly up and
aski eagerly: "What is it?"
The ladies look rosy and glide away.
The laborer refers to the A. D. T. boy,
who knows. The boy volunteers the
information that he was "jes' seein'
how long that guy wuz goin' to stan'
there," and the guy looks up, with a
start, and says: h
"Bless my soul, I was just thinking te
about the little girl at the lunch coun- h
ter." re
And then he claps his hand over his t4
mouth, turns red and gets away ats a
"late-for-my-train" gait. CI

Something radically different from
any of these, but also called (perhaps d
more appropriately) an "incandeseent- .
arc," was described in a paper before
the electriccl congess in Chicago last
Smonth. it is the mivettiOf of Louis B.
Howard, of New YTfk eity. TheA
special advantage claitmed fol this de
vice is that the carbon will last one
hundred hours, thus reducing the con
sumption of pencils at least nineb
tenths, and, what is a still greate' 1
economy, not requiring a lamp trim
mer to visit it more than once every
week or ten days. In fact, in certain
test cases .the positive carbon in this
lasted about twenty times as long as
With the ordinary commercial lamp, T
and the negative almost a hundred.
Mr. Howard puts his carbons in a li
small closed envelope of especially hi
hard glass. When the dSO Ist formed s
and the pencils begin to burn, carbon- si
ic acid gas is developed, and that e
vapor serves a double purpose: It
checks combustion and it diffuses the 0o
light by becoming incandescent from al
heat. The entire contents of the m
chamber glow so vividly that the arc 01
itself at the center is barely percept- P
Sible by contrast. To prevent explo- ni
sion from the expansion of the gases
a small safety valve is provided, allow- ft
ing egress only. Around the movable sl
pencil-for automatic adjustment of
the burning carbon is required in this
as in other are lights-there is a
chance for a little fresh air to leak in; hi
but it is assimilated too quickly to do hi
harm. It will be noticed that this ti
lamp is a trifle more costly in its a
mechanism; and as a purer carbon is te
needed for its successful operation, ti
still another slight addition to the a~
expense is involved. But the electrical ti
papers look upon - this invention with ta
such favor that it is to be hoped that
it may soon have a thorough trial on
a commercial scale.
MIr. Louis B. Marks, who presented
this subject at Chicago, is a young
but promising electrician,, who has
given much attention to the Improve
ment of electric-lamp carbons.
WEIGHT OF A CROWD.
It 1s Said to 1e trem 140 to 150 Pounds
per Square Foot.
The load which is produced by a
dense crowd of persons is generally
taken at 80 8to 100 pounds per square
foot, and is considered to be the great
est uniformly distributed load for
which a floor need be proportioned,
says the Engineering News. That this
value may be largely exceeded in an
actual crowd was pointed out by Prof.
W. C. Kernot, of the Melbourne uni
versity, Australia, in a recent paper
before the Victorian Jnstitute of En- jo1
gineers. In an actual, trial a class of a
students averaging 158. pounds each
in weight was crowded in a lobby con- ly
taining 1,823 square feet, making an los
average floor load of 134.7 pounds.
There was still room to have placed th
another man, which would have tal
brought np the loqding to 148.1 pounds
per square foot.
Prof. Kernot also quoted from
Stoney, who placed fifty-eight Irish Is- th
borerr, averaging 145 pounds each in lai
weight, in an empty ship doekhouse en
-measuring 57 square feet floor area. (
This was a load of Is7.4 ponnds per e
square foot. In another test, with
seventy-three laborers crowded into.
hut 9 feet by 8 feet 8 Inches, Stoney
produced a load. of 148 pounds -gpeir
square foot, ahd esttimated that two or
three more men coahld have been.

The Mimicry ef Nature.
Curious resemblances in nature start
with the cocoanut, in many respects
like the human skull and almost a fec- -
simile of the monkey's. The meat of the
English walnut is almost a copy of the
human brain, plums and black cherries
like the human eye, almonds like the
human nost, and an opened oyster and
shell t perfect likeness of the human
ear. The shape of a man's body may
be traced in the mammoth squash, the
open hand in growing scrub willows s
and celery, the human heart in Ger- I
man turnips and egg plant, and dozens f
of the mechanical inventions of the t
present day to patterns furnished by I
nature. Thus the hog suggested the I
plow, the butterfly the door hinge, the 0
frog stool the umbrella, the duck the
ship, and the fungus growth on trees
the bracket.-Journal des Sciences. b
The Moon Ian, Lmsay.
A short time before Dr. Charcot died e

had for more than fifty years ridiculed o
the idea that the full of the moon was a
a dangerous time for mad people. Bet
ter informed men are coming back to
that old-time notion, said Dr. Charcot,
as the result of increased learning on
the suoject of earth tides, similar to
the oprillation of sea tides.
