OUR WAIINGTOUN LFaTdEL.
WASHINGTON D. C., Aug. 21,1878.
Everybody know how the visiting. '1
statemen would testify wheb, they,
werecalled upon. Oh Weddnesd.ay at
Atlantic City, Messrs. Sherman, Kel
ley and Hale told their story. It is
known that all of themj w.ile at Now
Orleans, waded to the shoulder in a
sea of perjury, forgery and theft.
Nothing else was around them, and:
nothing else in sight. From the I
nameless negroes who swore to any
thing that was required, down to Kel
logg, these visiting statesmen had no.
associates who were not for sale at
any price that was offered. Yet their I
testimony on Wednesday would in
dicate that they believed they were all
the time associating with gentlemen
who would scorn the idea of wrong.
These "visiting statesmen" are either t
too pure for this world or too corrupt
to be continued in office. Elections
soon to occur cannot serve a 11101more
useful purpose than in retiring them.
Sherman's testimony on Thursday is
especially remarkable. He associ- a
ated with none but gentlemen while
at New Orleans ; had no private in
terviews with politicians;- did not
meet Weber or Anderson. !Ii short,
he and his associates had all the art
less innocence of a children's class in
a Sunday school away for a day's
pleasure. Yet at that time Ie he was
corresponding with Hayes, and Lere
is the substance of their first two let
ters. I dont give the words, which
are many, but the substance.
SHERMAN TO JAYt;s.
"There is no doubt the State, rent
"for Tilden. It ought to hnae 'gdue
"for you. We thought yesterday we
"had it fixed, but have just discover
"ed that some of your electors were
"left off the tickets and are far be
"hind. You will see the great im
"portance of this. I have not before
"thought necessary to write to you.
"What shall we do ?"
HAYES TO SHERMAN.
"I ought to have had forty electoral
votes in the South. Be honest." A
blind man can see the desperate game
that the childlike Sherman wanted to
play, but hesitated about putibtso
heard from his chief Ha:yes saw -it,
and wrote a reply which ought to
make him in history the phief of
hypocrites.
Senator Conkling who for a year
or more has been the sulky scbhool
boys in American politics, is to have
further punishment. Mr. Hayes is tc
put new men into the lfew-ti4k tt
offices if the New Yore! BnGn
erous private letters are tulbe hiev
ed. As far as possible, 'the story
says, members of the ,Grands Army of
the Republic are to be selected to
succeed the retiring friends of Sen
ator Conkling. And then the Senator
will sit at his desk and make up.faret
at the Administration' Lehind his
back.
This idea of utilizing the Grand
Army as a political machine is not in
all respects a bad one. Democrats
and Republicans at the 'est session
of Congress united in -unfair legisla
tion unquestionably enimical to the
interests of voluoteera; of 'tlle ate
war. Most of them did it blindly, at
the close of the session, and will early
in the coining session vote for repeal.
The proposition of Mr. Hayes to take
advantage of the bad feeling e'izfitg
among thIe soldiers is really worthy'ot
a shrewd politician.
Idle and Useless Youengller .
An English lady-who ran cook en
larges in a lively letttr to' the L'oUtdoff
rQtandard on one of the kfti$vances
of the present day, o wit;, the number
of utterly useless and idle young wives,
who, being incapable themselves, spoil
their servants, and then wonder that
the husband leaves the ill-cooked meal,
perhaps ill served, also, to dine at his
club. They say contemptuonsly that
they were not brought up to that kind
of thing, and consideritbeneathl them.
'Thlis lady repliei:~b &hte was ubit
brought up to it ei rttsaei enies
that it is beneati any gentlewoman to
contribute to the eomfortt- of those
around her. If she need oLt. h4a ute.
ly work with her owa flan-ti, the
mistrees of a house should certainly
have sufficient knowedge to direct
her subordinates, or they will soon
. discover ignorence and beconp in.,
subordinate. Nor need absolute per.
formance of their duties ioterfere with
other pursuits. This lady 'confeees
that after pastry and cake making ip
the morniong.~ber hands is fombmimes
too tremulous for .her ay.rptt qi~
Spainting, or to help h'er husbiand in
the preparation of objects for hit
microscope, but it is easy to finod some
other occupation when thiissa isa.t eqCat
and sihe has not lost-tiBer love forart,
nor her appreciation of hience; be
cause she is happy enough to be a
lady who can cook.
