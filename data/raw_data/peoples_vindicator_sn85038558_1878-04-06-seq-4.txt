OUR WASHINGTON LETTER.
WASHINGTON D. C., March `3, 187?.
What is called a deficiency bill, and
is now before the Senate, is not prop
erly a deficiency lill. But little of
the million and more provided for is
for deficiency. On the contrary it is
for future expenses, and tounch of it
for expenses of a new and questiona
ble character. If the bill shall get
through the Senate the IHouse nunjor.
ity will do well to scan it closely. In
the discussion of it yestetrday the ben
eficiaries-the people who were to lie'
continued in the public service-o ac
among the worst characters made Ino
torious during the two terms of Grant.
They are men that no man vouches
for. They ate moral and social out
casts. Thev have hleretofore been
used by corrupt secretaries to "aid"
in the administration of justice, andl
while as employed have won the con
tempt of all good citizens by turning
into merchandise the power lwhichl
their irregular government employ
ment at once gave them and protect
ed them in selling. The bill will bear
careful examination. But 1 started
out to protest against calling it a '"dle
tficiengy" bill. At the elections next
Fall we shall hear Republican orators
denouncing Democratic attempts at
economy and alluding to this nmoney
as a `deficiency" made necessary by
injndicious reductions in appropria
tions.
The chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee yesterday announ
ced that the legislative and executive
appropriation bill would be reported
to the full Committee today, and to
the House very soon, and that it
would show cousidesable reduction
from last year.
Yesterday the Naval Appropriatiotn
bill was reported to the House andl
passed without amendmentt. It cuts
down sometlhing more than $2,000,t)M)
the amount recommended by the Sec
retary. On this bill, as probably on
most of the other regular approptr ia
tion bills, there will be a conttest ho
tween the House and senate. For
the good of the country, not less than
for party advantage, it is to be hoped
tlhat the House will insist on every
item of reduction. Thie House Coti
mittee is sure it is right-it has been
almost too cautions in) its moveImenIts
and conservative in its reforms-and
should be sustained by the Democrat
ic House.
The Pension Appropriation bill co
vers about the usual amount-a ltttle
less than $30,000,000-and to this sium
there will be no objection. The Cone
mittee has, however, provided for the
payment of pensions directly from the
Treasury-instead as now, through
agents of the government in dliterent
sections. As the present system works
well the only groundat ot which a
chltange is advocated is that of econo
my. It is said that a large force of
men here can do the work more cheap
ly thIan the same number of muen in
different parts of the country.
Nothing but actual experiment will
show how this may be. IBut there is
one feature of the provision that
ought not to be lost sight of. About
50,000 pensions are paid in person now
at the different agencies. They go
before the Government agent for pay.
ing pensions, execute the necessary
paper before him, and receive their
money without any expense. Under
the new system these 500,000 men
will be compelled to pay from 50c to
$1 each for the execution of their pa
pers, for postage, &c. Whtat the Go
vernment will save, if aitythting, will
come out of the ptockete of thte pean
sioners. Your readers may remember
that I orged the sanme olbjection, a
year or so ago, to the reduction of the
mmumber otf agencies frotn,61) to 18. It
is a significant tact that. 'Li- commis
eioner of Pensions, whoI uceuaed that
reduction, oppase thte pr-esent schiemtie
and is, now convinced that a larger
number of agencies was prefernble to
the present number. AILBION.

A correspondent of the Los Angelos
Blerald relates the effects of placing I
a few leaves of the castor oil plant
nbder trees that were being destroy- s
ed by grasshoppers. So remarkable
was the result tlhat an actual count of
the number killed unader one tree
Sshowed 498 dead "hoppers," with
about twenty more in a dying cotdi- f
tion. Judgir g from the effects so saon c
produced by thesmall portion of the
leaves eaten, there must have been
material left to kill ten times as many.
The poison of the leaves work rapid- I
ly, the grashopper at once becom
logatupified, and when he attempts
to fly, falls on his head or back and ii
remains prostrate until le dies. o
Act No. 84, approved March 13, c
gives police juries throughout the y
State, full and plenary autltotity to
make such regulations as they may
deem proper in regard to the sale, g
barter or exchange of intoxicating b
liquors or merchandike on Sunday, a;
and to totally prohibit the samne on n
Shunday, if in their judgment neces- t
sary. Violations of all ordin'aces ti
duly passed and promulgated accord- d
ing to the provisions of the act are to ci
be considered misdemeanors, and the
penalties fixed in the ordinances for
such violation in and court of con)
potent jurisdiction. 81
The following obituary appeared in (1
a Memphis paper on a man killed by '
a circular saw : "He was an upright d
Christian, a good citizen, and an ar- 8
dent patriot, but of a limited infor
mation wtth regard to circular saws." d
Gov. Vance, of North Carolina, an 01
efficient executive and one of the ci
brightest tuen in the South, seems to at
be a general favorite for the next b<
United States Senatorship. Mr. Mer- p
rimon's term expires in March, 1879. B

New York 8siS: Anderson can now
return to his quarters in tlte New Or- be

President did not remove him from cl
office when he was convicted of the hi
crime by which the fraudulent Pres- r
ideut got into the White House, and at
his release furnished no new reason gl
for his removal. It is a terrible dia. ti'
grace that such a man sltould hold le
