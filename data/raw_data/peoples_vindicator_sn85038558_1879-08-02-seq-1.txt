LIVER PILLS
FOR THE CURE OF
Hepatitis, or Liver Complaint,
DYSPEPSIA AND SICK HIADACCn.
Symptoms of a Diseased Liver.
1AIN in the right side, under the
I edge of the ribs, increases on pres
sure ; sometimes the pain is in the left
side; the patient is rarely able to lie
on the left side; sometimes the pain
is felt under the shoulder blade, and
it frequently extends to the top of the
shoulder, and is sometimes mistaken
for rheumatism in the arm. The stom
ach is affected with loss of appetite
and sickness; the bowels in general
are costive, sometimes alternative with
lax; the head is troubled with pain,
accompanied with a dull. heavy sen
sation in the back part. There is gen
erally a considerable loss of memory,
accompanied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done. A slight,
dry cough is sometimes an attendant.
The patient complains of weariness
and debility; he is easily startled, his
feet are cold or burning, and he com
plains of a prick!y sensation of the
skin; his spirits are low; and although
he is satisfied that exercise would be
benefcial to him, yet he can scarcely
summon up fortitude enough to try it.
In fact, he distrusts every remedy.
Several of the above symptoms attend
the disease, but cases have occurred
where few of them existed, yet exam
ination of the body, after death, has
shown the LIVER to have been exten
sively deranged.
AGUE AND FEVER.

taken with Quinine, are productive of
the most happy tesults. No better
cathartic can be used, preparatory to,

For all bilious derangements, and

Folded Away.
BY FIDLIA.
D y by day, we told away
Some treasure that our hearts hold dear,
Soue cherished thing to which we cling
And,bless with many a kim and tear.
A shred of laes may hold a place
That jewels rare could never win;
With love untold a ribdou old
Is laid our dearest shrine within.
A little tress we fondly press
Unto a heart that aches with pain ;
Then, with a sigh for days gone by,
We fold it from our sight again.
And is there not a hallowed spot,
In memory's casket lying low,
Where day by day we fold away
Our heart-thoughts lest the world should
know ?
Many a one, now lost and gone.
In sweet day dreamings we behold,
Who, in our sleep, comne back to keep
With as their vigils as of old.
And yet alas! such dreams must pam ;
Life sterner duties must be met,
Quickly we turn and strive to learn
That cruel lesson-to forget !
When from the gleam of love's sweet
dream
Our hearts awake in sad surprise,
How dimly burn, where'er we turn,
The lesser lights that meet our eyes ?
Wten o'er the dead our tears are shbed,
While on the silent lips we press
The last fond kiss-oh, is not this
The summit of life's loneliness I
And yet we know. though all lie low
Whom we have ever loved or known,
Still we mast live and learn to give
To earth the elaims it call its own.
O grief untold! with hearts grown old,
Like fowers blighted in a day.
How fondly then from sight of men
We fold our dear dead loves away.
A Night's Experleame In the Forests
of Canada.
[East of Dunraven in the Nineteenth
Century.]
It was a mest lovely evening. It
wanted but about half an bour to son
down, and all was perfectly still.
There was not the slightest sound of
anything moving in the forest except
that of the unfrequent light of a
moose bird close by. And so I sat
watcbing that most glorious trans
bormation scene-the change of day
into night; saw the great sum sink
slowly down behind the pine trees;
saw the few clouds that hovered ms.
tionlees above me blase into the color
of bright burnished gold; saw the
whole atmosphere become glorious
with a soft yellow light, gradually
dying out as the night crept on, till
only in the western sky there linger
ed a faint glow, fading into a pale
cold apple green, against which the
pines stood out as black as midnight
and as sharply defined as though eat
oat of steel. As the darkness deep
ed a young crescent moon shone out
pale and clear, with a glittering star
a little below tihe lower horn, and
above her another star of leser mags
ultede. It lonked as though a sn
pernaturaral jewel-a heavenly peond
ant, two great diamoud soliaires and
a diamond erescent-were hanging
in the western aky. After a while
the moone, toe, eank behind the trees,
and darkness fell upon the earth.
I know of nothing more enchanting
than a perfectl) ealm and silent ao
tomonal sunset in the woods unless it
he the sunrlare, which to my mind is
moIe lovely still. Snoset Le beauti.
fol, but sad; seunrise I equally beauo
tiful and full of life, bapuiness and
hope. I love to wateh the stare be-.
gin to fade, to see theim irt faint white
light elear up the darkness of the
easters sky, and gradually deepen
into tim gloriousacolorlug that heralds
the approaching soun. I love to see
natnre awake, shodderig, ase she al
ways does, and arouse herself into
active, busy life; to note the insect.,
birds and beasts shake off damber
and set about their daily tasks.
Still the sunset is inexpressibly
lovely, and I do not envy the eoadi.
thin and frame of mind ofa man who
cannot beo as nearl happy as man
eco be, when be is lying comfortably
on a luzurious and s eoch, gasing
in perfeet peace on the glorious seeoe
around him, rejoicing all his senses,
and aturating himself with the
wooderful beautles of a Northern
sunset.
$o I sat quietly below, while the
Indian called from the tree-top. Not
a sound answered to the three or four
long-drawn.ont notes with wbhich be
hoped to lore the bell; after a lng

sot ledirous mistakes. Toward
orlng, about dabeak, I have
frequently mistaken the brat fainat
buss of some minute fly, within a
foot or so of my ear, for the call of
moose two or three miles off.
About 10 o'clock the Indian gave it
up in despair and came down the
tree; we rolled ourselves up in our
rugs, pulled the hoods of our blanket
close over our heads and went to
sleep. I awoke literally shaking with
cold. It was still the dead of night;
and the stars were shining with ion
tense brilliancy, to my great disap
pointment, for I was in hopes of seee
ing the first streaks of dawn. It was
freezing very hard, far too hard for
me to think of going to sleep again.
So I roused the Indian and suggested
that he should try another call or
two.
Accordingly be stole down to the
edge of the little point of wood in
which we had ensuonced ourselves,
and in a few minutes the forest was
reecboilog the plaintiff notes of the
moose. Not an answer, not a sonod
utter silence, as if all the world
were dead! broken suddenly and
horribly by a yell that made the blood
curdle in one's veins. It was the
long, quavering, human, but unearth.
ly scream of a loon on the distant
lake. After what seemed to me
many hours, but what was in reality
but a short time, the first indications
of dawn repealed themselves in the
rising of the morning star, and the
slightest possible paling of the east.
ern sky. The cold grew almost no
bearable. That cnrious shiver that
runs through nature-the frst icy
current of air that precedes the day
-chilled us to the bones. I rolled
myself up in my blanket and lighted a
pipe, trying to retain what little calorio
remained in my body, while the Indian
again ascended the tree. By the time
he had called twice it was gray dawn.
Birds were beginning to more about,
and busy squirrels to look out for their
breakfast orf pine buds. I sat listening
intently, and watching the blank, ems
tionless face of the Indian as he gazed
around him, when suddenly I saw his
countenance blaze up with vivid excite
meat. His eyes seemed to start from bhis
head, his museles twitched, bis face glow
ed, he seemed transformed in a moment
into a different being. At the same
time be began with the atmost celerity,
but with extreme caution to deseend to
the ground. He motioned to me to make
no noise, and whispered that a moose
was coming across the barren and must
be close by. Grasping my rifle, we
crawled arefelly through the grams,
crisp and noisy with frost, down to the
edge of the island of woods, and there,
after peering cautiously around some
stunted juniper bushes, I saw stading
about sixty yards off, a bull moose. He
looked gigantic in the this moraniag mist
which was beginning to drift up bsm
the surface of the barren. Great vol.
nmes of stem leaned from his nostrils,
and his whole aspect, looming in the
fog, was vast and almost terrific. He
stood there perfeetly motionles, staring
at the spot from which be had heard the
cry of the supposed cow, irresolute
whether to some on or not. The In
dian was anxions to bring him a little
closer, but I did not wish to run the
risk of scaring him, and so, taking aim
as fairly as I could, considering I was
hakinog all over with cold, I fred and
strueek him behind the shoulder. He
plunged forward on his knees, Jumped
up, rushed forward for about two hun
dred yards, and then fell dead at the
edge of the heavy timber on the far side
of she barrea.

MARVELOUS SNAKES.
A Menter Tweaty Feet Loang-Rab
bit ad Dog Mistakldng Its Mouth
for a Hollow Log.
[Oxford N. C. Torchlight.)
About one mile and a half from the
railroad bridge spanning Tar River at
Franklinton is the residence of Julius W.
Hight, who not long since married a
Mis Cash. Everything went on lovely
until summer set in and the snakes be
na to show themselves about the house
and yard in gangp anddroves. The first
time that he took fright was after killing
one about ten feet long which he bang
apeo the fence and aragged it under
the bose to keep it under the hearth
stone. He then began to watch, and a
day or two thereafter be saw them
crawling around lazsiy, from six to ten in
a gang. Things now bean to look so
rious, and Hight left the next day for
Kittrells to get ammunition to begin
war upon them, but while he was gone,
a eouple of ladies called upon his wife,
and while she was regaling them with
snaky information, oue of the trio hap
pened to look toward the east door,
when lo! what a monster met her gaze.
A scream brought the party to their feet.
The monster's head appeared to beo about
three feet high, four feet of its body was
on the Aoor, and its tail was just clearing
the corner of the house. The ladies ran
as fast as they could. The snake dashed
right by the hindmost ones, and took
after Hight's wife, but, she being very
leet, finally escaped it. Mr. Hight saw
one in the path the other day twenty
feet long, as large as a "man's boot
leg," mouth open, and looking as
reinside as a ball of fire. His dog was
running a rabbit at the tintsme, and ap
prosachig rapidly in the direction of the
isake. He hasteed to the house to get
his shot-gpn to shoot the monster, and
abhout the time he got there his dog quit
runaing. He hastened back to try his
artillery on the snake, but be was too
lat for it was gone. He has heard
nothing from his dog since, and now
irmly believes that the rabbit ran in the
nsake's month, mistaking it for a hobl
low log, and that the dog followed;
consequently the eake bagged both,
and sid ofe to bhis quarters. They are
blowing and hissing around his house all
night, and one makes a noise like a gob.
bler, while another that stays in the
woao ear by keeps up a bllouwing at
regular intervals. Hight has been put
ting his chickens under pote and tube to
keep them from the maikes at night, un
til one morning be found that a certain
pet and chicken ware both gone, so be
straightway carried his ebickens to his
fath-ln-law's. About a week gob his
wife heard seeh a hibinag and blowing
that she awoke him to get up and mee
what was the matter. A light showed
several very mlarge akes writig ad
sqairming about em te fo.or. Hi Wif
bolted for the door, declariog that she
waMld sy no longer in snake den, bat
was going to her farthber's bouse. He

At intervals of abous fifteen min-.

On Saturday, the 5th, with several
other gentlemen, I visited him aad
conversed with him for about an hbol

hearing all we said ; and we noticed
considerable improvement in his art

first he declined trying to pronounce
the word "Williametou," because he
said he could not pronunce it right;

were matters of great astonishment
to all.
Sunday afternoon he heard his first
music. He attended service at the
colored Methodist church, sad the
singing, which was right vigoreous,
overpowered him. He could not re
alize the distinction of the sounds,
but it all seemed to him "like a lend
noise blown through a straight hore."
After service, he heard lady pla
some sacred pieces on the reed or an,
and though he enjoyed it still "bad
no tern."
On Monday, while listening to the
piano, he seemed greatly interested,
and professed to enjoy it very mech,
but it seemed to me as I watehed him
that he was more impressed with the
quick movements of the hammers
than with the tones of the inbstr
ment.
For the statement to connection
with his strange attack on Thursday
afternoon, I am indebted to Mareus
himself and his uncle, Edmond Jones,
whose character for veracity is nun.,
nually fair in our community. As to
the other points in the abover nar*
rative, there is as room for doubt.
He was a deaf mate from his birth
till he left here eight years ago. He
seemed to be in the same condition
when he returned last Monday week.
He cana hear and speak now as well
as the maJorith of our people. How
the wonderful change was brought
about remains to be explained.
Toombs' Oplnate.
iHoe. Robert Toombs, of Georgia,
was recently asked by a reporter of
the Philadelphia Times who was the
greatest man with whom he had sarv
ed in publio life, and what was his
opinion of the presidents with whom
he had been thrown. We &ive his
opinions for what they are worth.
He replied as follows:
"All in all, Mr. Webster was the
greatest mas I ever knew. Not the
most eloquent, but the greatest. As
a regulator of men, Clay was his a.s
.perior, and on eeasions Clay was as
eloquent .as men could well be.
Calhoun was the greatest logician I
ever knew; It may meem strange, bet
the two ubat eloqent gnatlmen I
ever heard were Yankees, Chete.
sad Prentiss. They were ins.
parable.i Prenties was the mes o.eo
quent, probably, bat Chests was tim
best debater. I saw Chato and
Webetler pitted ones sd to WebleOr's
discomturoe. In thea days our
statesmen were maesh better aholars
than they arse now. These was Iess
general eluration. The' mgrmatest
Sotheroer I ever knew, n[ prob.
ably the Igreatest man err produaed
by the Sonth, was MeDuffie and
the most eloquent Southerner W. C.
Preston." "Bath Carolinlians P' 'No,

Preston a Virginitno. Radolph was
a remarkable man, but deponded more
opon bhis exeeenti, ounique manner
than apon his real greatoeas. Tase
