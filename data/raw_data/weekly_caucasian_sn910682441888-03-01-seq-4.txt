Jamea 31. Wilson, hoad master of Clif
ton college, England, and aonior wran
gler (that Is, first in the honor examin
ation for mathematics) in tho year 18)9.
I was at St. John's college, Cimbridge,
when he wns there, taking my dogroo
only one year later. I was captain of
the boat club to which ho belonged,
and have playod in the same games
with him at foot-ball and at cricket
Ho was a capital wickct-kcepor, which,
though not in itself a proof that ho
would not be liable to fanciful notions,
will suffice to show every ono who
knows what crickot h that he was zjal
ous in open-air games, since nothing
but constant practice will enable any
'he to koep wicket successfully. Tho
foJ&wing narrative is in his own wonls:
Tvas at Cambridgo, in full health,
boating,, foot-ball playing, and tho like,
and by no means subject to halluci
nations or morbid fancies. One even
ing I felt extremely ill; trembling,
with no apparent causo whatever, nor
did it seem to bo a physical illneis or
chill of any kind. I was frightened.
I was totally unable to overcome it.
J remember a sort of struggle with my
self, resolving that I would go on with
m j mathematics; but it was in vain. I
became convincad that I was dying. I
was in a strange discomfort, but with
no symptoms that I can recall except
mental discomfort, and the conviction
that I should die that night. Towards
eleven, after somo throe hour3 of this,
I got better and went upstair, and got
io Dea, and alter a time to sleep and
next morning was quite well In the
next afternoon came a letter to say that
my twin brother had died 'tho cveuiug
before in Lincolnshire. I am quito
clear of the fact that I never once
thought of him, nor was his presence
with me even dimly imagined."
Let this story, in which not only was
no apparition seen, but the presence of
the relative who died at the time of the
strange sensation was not even imagined
be compared with tho following, which
is one of the best authenticated of a
class of stories whoso nnmo is now bo
coming legion :
In September, 1857,Captaiu W., of the
Sixth Dragoon Guards, left England to
join his regiment ia India, leaving his
wife at Cambridge. On the night be
tween the 14th and 15th of November,
1837, ahe dreamed that sho saw her hus
band looking very ill, and she thereupon
e in creat agitation- When
she aaw the tame figure stand-

December, 1837, a telegram from the
teat of war appeared in the morning
papers, stating that Capt. W. had been
killed before Lucknow on the fifteenth
of November. The family solicitor ap
plied for further information as to the
date of Captain "VV.'s death, which Mrs.
W. felt sure must have taken place on
the fourteenth, and not on the fifteenth.
But the date given in the telegram was
confirmed at the war office. At this
tirae a singular circumstance came to
li rht The solicitor chanced to men
tion the caso of a lady, a friend of his,
who, according to his account, had a
tendency to see visions. Turning to
her husband, she said :
"That must have been tho same ap
parition I saw on the evening when we
were speaking about India."
They were able to fix the date by
means of a receipt for an amount paid
that day, as the fourteenth of Novem
ber. The solicitor on this applied to
the war office again, saying that the
friends of Captain W. were persuaded
there must be some mistake about tho
date. The officials stated, however,
that there could be no mistake, sinco
the death was referred to in two dis
patches from Sir Colin Camp
bell, .who, in both cases, gave
the date as the fifteenth. In March,
1858, a letter arrived from a brother
officer, giving an account of Captain
W.'a death. This officer, who had been
riding beside Captain W.'whcn ho was
killed, stated that death occurred oa
the fourteenth of November. Finally,
'though whether on tho strength of this
.' officer's evidence, or through faith in
tb apparition's truth to time, the data
was altered to the fourteenth.

dispensable, if this makes the room too
cold, a firo must be lighted to counter
act it.
A warm sponge bath should be given
each day, folded blankets being placed
over and under tho patient in bed, the
night-dress removed and the hand hold
ing the spongo being passed under the
upper blanket while bathing, to avoid
exposure. Tho window should be shut
during the bath. If the rash causes
much irritation it may be rubbed with
cosmoline or sweet oil.
The eyes should bo carefully shaded
from the light, and no reading permitted
until they arc strong agnin. Serious in
flammation and permanent weakness of
tho eyes may follow, if these precau
tions aro not taken. It is often very
hard to keep a child amused and happy
under these restrictions. This is one of
tho difficulties that a good nurse will
overcome, ;md sho must remember that
tho child's comfort during life may de
pend upon tho care it receives at this
time.
To avoid cold, all clothing should be
warmed and aired before being used. A
flannel jacket worn over the night-dress
is a great protection.
If delirium come3 on, and tha rash
suddenly disappears, ths sufferer should
bo put into a warm bath containing four
tablespoon fuls of mustard to each pail of
water, taken out after a few minutes,
quickly dried with warm towels, and
wrapped in blankets until tho doctor j
comes. It tno cnild has a quick puho

According to a German paper tha in
ventor of lucifcr matches was a political
prisoner, who perfected his idea in 1833,
within the vails of a state prison. Kam
merer was a native of Ludwigsburg, and
when sentenced to six months' impris
onment nt Hohenasperg, he was fortu
nato enough to attract tho notico
and to gain the favor of an old officer
in charge of tho prison, who, finding he
was studying chemistry, allowed him to
arrange a small laboratory in his cell.
Kammerer had been engaged in re
searches with a view of improving the
defective steeping system, according to
which splinters of wood, with sulphur
at the ends, were dipped into a chemi
cal fluid in order to produce a flame.

against the walls of hit cell. On com

manufacture of matches. Unfortunately,
tho absence of a patent law prevented
his rights from being secured, and on
Austrian and other chemists analyzing
the composition, imitations speedily
made their appearand. In 1835 tho
German states prohibited the use of
these matches, considering them dan
gerous. When they were mado in Eng
land and sent to tho continent these
regulations were withdrawn, but too
late to bo of any benefit to the inventor,
who died in the madhouse of his native
town in 1857. Prairie Farmer.

A very pretty little woman, with a

Chestnut street Saturday afternoon.
When opposite the Mint sho hilled,

given out moro sparingly and with a
strict view to the assistance of worthy
laboring men whose regular employ

On applying for work the men are ques

Sixteen logs may not seem like a very
heavy task but to a green hand it means
nearly a full day of hard labor. A
reasonably expert wood chopper " might
finish the work in five hours, or possibly
a trifle less. Each log has to be sawed
into five lengths. By the time a saw
has been engineered through a pine log
eighty times the sawyer is likely to have
become painfully aware of tho fact that
ho has a back. Tho splitting is not so
difficult, but Superintendent Alcott
says that he has to keep tho closest sort
of a watch to keep the men from sol
diering on him. Tho really deserving,
however, soon get the hang of the
work, become reasonably expert in a
day or two and perform their tasks as if
they had some interest in them. Per
functory work, however, is the rule by
a large majority.
Fifty-six is tho largest number of

Cows' hair, which hitherto has been
of little uso except in mortar for walls

Little Things that Kill.
At various times the newspapers have
warned the public against swallowing
the seeds of grapes, oranges, etc., be
cause of the danger of such substances
getting into a small intestinal bag, or
cul-de-sac, called by doctors the appendix
wrmiftrmti. This is a receptacle formeil
at the junction of Vie large and small
intestines, but its uso or object no phy
sician knows. It has been thought to
be a rudimentary or incomplete forma
tion or possibly somo meaningless sur
vival of a lost anterior type. At anv
rate, its existence, while presenting no
appareu. "reason lor being," as the
French say, is, on the other hand, a
positive and constant source of dan
ger, because of the liability of its be
coming the receptacle of some undigest
ed seed of other indigestible substance.
In that case it produces a state of in
flammation, which, in nearly all cases,
proves fatal. Fortunately, but few
seeds among the great number so heed
lessly swallowed, seem to get into this
little dath-trap although any one
seems likely to lodge there. Perhaps
more cases of inflammation of the bow

reality due t? this obscure and disre-
