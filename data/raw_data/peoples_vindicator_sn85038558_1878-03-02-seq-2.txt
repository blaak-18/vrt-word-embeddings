''lThe Thiih,ý,danx Sentinel is deter
minied lot to he trapped into the sup
port of a conicitintllioiiI cunvention
"at this time." All along; it has in.
,i..1d that the "talenti" aml *high
111 ',1.!- oitlef ilth Dr ,itoeintie in, mi
heiit' of th present Geiral Asslii l~t
wIe e ;issulaces in lhemtsel ves that
aill tio "''Ietonis necessary," "at this
timle," could he had by legislative
(htlac11im tt. A constitutitlonal eonVen11
tion coull be obiviateld by "wise, ju
dicious and proper amendments" fIom
the Legislature. This "wise" legis
lature having mirerably failed to sits
tain tlhe high character reposed in
it by the Sentinel, therefore it was rea
sonable to suppose we could expect its
suppor't of a measureti thie great 0mass
of Ipeopleo of this State demanded,
and which had been solemnly prom
ised them by the I)emocratic party
a new, Ihoinest and just coiistitution.
Not so, however. The Sentinel slips
out of its legislative argument with
the ease of an eel. Hear him :
'rThe present Legislature, or at least
the Democratic members were chos en
upon a platform on nl hich were dis
played in conspicuous letters, the
words retrenchment and reform ; the
cry upon every stump was that the
plundering of the people's money
must be brought to a close, and that
honorable and honest men must he
placed in front who would guard the
people's interests and work only for
the general prospetity and public
welfare. This was the language used
by the Orators sent out by the Demo
cracy all over the State, and under
these pi ornises and pledges, made by
all the Candidates, that patty suc
cessfully carried the State at the elec
tion in 1876.
Now in this very session of the Leg
islature, whose )Democratic members
were chosen as the Representatives
of a policy of reformation the specta
cle is exhibited of twenty six Demo
crats voting for the Mileage Grab by
which some forty or fifty thousand
dollars was taken from thie Treasury,
and placed in their own pockets,
without a particle of justice to sus
tain such action. Members of the
Legislature putting their hands into
the Treasury and paying themselves
twice for the saue mileage, a proceed
ing unheard of in the history of this
State heretofore, with no other
ground to sustain their votes, except
that such a provision was found in
this very Constitution that they ate
so anxious to overthrow by means of
another Convention.
It is natural to presume that the
Representatives in the Legislature
would be elected Delegates to a con
vention, or men of similar ideas of
reform. Can the people hope to gain
any benefit for the annoyance confu
sionis and jealousies that would be oc
casioned and engendered by an elee
tion of Delegates, and the expenses
which such a Convention would oc
casion ? Is there any reason to be
lieve that men who voted for the Mile
age Grab, the other day, in the Leg
islature, would not vote to retain the
same clause in any Convention they
might assist to frame ?
There's sophistry for you; and just
such reasoning has tended to iojure
the State more than anything else.
a Because one set of officials have
proven recreant to the trust re
posed in them, is good logic in the
eyes of the Sentinel why the people
F should cease altogether their strng
gle for relief. Out upon such stuff.
Our failure should and does serve to
inspire the people to renewed and
F vigorous action. We failed from
1868 to 1874 to secute the fruits of
victories we gained in four elections
a but that only inspired us to continue
the struggle. The very arguments
a now used by the Sentinel filled to
overflowing the columns of the rad
ical press of the past days, and we are
pained-indignant-we might say
to see-journals claiming to be Demo
cr atic indnlging in them:
No! The people will not be put down
by such clap trap. The pleading is
f special and specious from begining to
I end. Our purpose in North Louis
iana is for an honest government and
that can be obtained only by having
as its basis an honest Constitution !
Legislative poings.
The Bill lending the New Orleans
Pacific Railroad $2,000,000 has pass
ad the Legislature. and goes to the
Senate for concurrence.
Nothing of importance is being
done, or has been done in either
f House.
The Revenue Bill is severely de
nounced as a most "damnable meas
ure."
The Moffett Register will, it is
thought, be adopted as a mode of
revenue. The whiskey dealers in
New Orleans have petitioned against
it.
Examination of the charges of the
i purchase of the Radical members by
Howard's Lottery Company, progres
ses slowly. So far the charges, to
~ our mind, are sustained.
The Constitutional Amendments
B have stuck at number 12 (Judiciary)
B On that Amendment there has been
J amendlments by the House, and a
B conference Committee from both
Houses. report a new amendment,
" providing for not less than 30 nor
more than 45 Judicial Districts. This
- is reform with a vengeance.
Fiie Companies are being charter
ed and mens names changed with a
perfect unity of feeling, but when
the reduction of salaries is broached,
B the lawyers of the legislation pro.
nounce at once all effort to that end,
as either unconstitutional or an inva
melo of "tested rights."
