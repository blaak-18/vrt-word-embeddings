Strong Expressions of Opinion From the F. U. Boys
THE PRESIDENT OF THE LIN
COLN COUNTY UNION
SPEAKS OUT.
Dear Sir:—Your open letter to
C. S. Barrett was timely and to the
point. I had just finished a letter to
him when your paper was handed
me. I have known for some time
that there was something rotten up
the branch, and made an attack two
weeks ago today on those three ras
cals in my Union, and my people be
came so wrought up that I was
sharply criticised. But, as President
of the Lincoln County Union, I felt
it my duty to put my people (who
have been so often fooled) on notice
that there was graft in the wind. I
hope your open letter will have the
desired effect.
I believe you to be. true (if we
have differed in the past) to the
farming class, and I stand ready to
aid you in any way that will better
the condition of our common people.
With respects, I am
Yours truly,
J. P. STURKEY.

GOES AFTER THOSE FARMERS’
UNION- TRAITORS.
My Dear Mr. Watson:—Have just
read what you say in weekly of 25th
as to Duckworth and Texas Co
operator, and am sure that you are
right in your diagnosis of these
cusses. As to old man Jackson, my
opinion is that he was gulled into
presenting the Merchant Marine
resolution at Galveston by Duck
worth and others, the others being
Taylor McR. Niell and Bill Shaw, of
Dallas, Texas. The Co-operator is
rwned by a company in Fort Worth,
headed by C. D. Reimers, who is
not, so far as I know, a member of
‘ u e Farmers’ Union, nor are any of
the company; and the paper, in my
opinion, is under the Bailey influ
ence, as Niell a short time ago wrote
an article in favor of Bailey against
Bryan. The old hero, Harry Tracy,
of Tula, Texas, replied to him in fine
style in the Dallas News of October
1 5 th.
You are also right as to Foreign
Missions and Socialism and Com
munism. The people that I see are
well pleased with all you say about
these things. As ever
Your friend,
C. J. JACKSON.
Nolanville, Texas.
SOME PERTINENT QUERIES.
My Dear Sir: —I have been read
ing after you and watching after you
for these many years, and I never
have had any reason to change my
course.
Now, I want to ask some ques
tions through The Jeffersonian week
ly. It makes me feel bad to do so,
but I think it is best.
Through great enthusiasm, a good
many people, I, for one, took a $lO
share in a Phosphate Company,
originated by the Farmers’ Union,
paying one-fourth down. Said com
pany had purchased phosphate land,
and we were told that guano com
panies had cornered all the other
phosphate land. (Is that so?)
We have no showing for our pur
chase, and we are informed they or
ganized what was called the Florida
Land Company and took over all the
papers of the Phosphate Company.
I was delegate to the two last State
conventions. In the last Convention,
I lost confidence in our leaders. I
came back home and told my peo
ple, and they sat flat down on me,
as the saying is.
Now, I want to know where we
are at. I don’t think I will pay any
more into the Phosphate Company.
We farmers fall over each other to
get into anything that looks like it
will benefit us any. We do not
watch as we should. I venture to
say there is not one in a hundred
who has read the minutes of the
State meetings.
I want to ask our Executive Com
mittee where they got the money to
pay that SBO per month office rent
in Macon for that Cotton Company;
also where did the money come from
to settle that SI,OOO loss in that
Produce Company in Atlanta? The
report of the Secretary said the two
notes that they had of SI,OOO each,
and the money on hand made $1,700,
and some cents. If I mistake not,
the Executive Committee report
read the same way. Now, I think
people who can’t beat that ought to
resign.
Hon. Com., how is it you author
ized State President to receive $l5O
for one month’s service? What was
that S4OO and some cents, marked
“Miscellaneous” for? what was that
bill, anyway? Explain. Then pray
tell us what John I. Fullwood want
ed with a clerk, as a lecturer, and
paid him SSO. Honorable Commit
tee, what did you all do to earn the
money you received?
No use in saying anything more.
When I saw those things, I was like
Hannibal when he recognized the
face of his dead brother, and said.
“O, Carthage, I see thy fate!” I
thought I saw the great principles
of the Union trailing in the dust. If
there is not something done, our
Union is gone.
Mr. Watson, you have said that
Charlie Barrett was pure gold. If
so, he will be scared with mistakes.
Tell us where we are at, and if
they can make us pay that other
$7.50. Respectfully,
J. B. JOHNSON.
LaFayette, Georgia.
ANSWERING A FRIEND AS TO
THE HANNACRAT LEADERS OF
THE FARMERS’ UNION.
Mr. T. C. Grier, Egypt, Ga.
My Dear Sir: —Your favor receiv
ed. While your letter is too late to
be discussed in this week’s Jeffer
sonian, you will find several editorials
in which reply is made to those edi
torials which Duckworth had in his
last week’s paper. In this week’s
Jeffersonian, you will find a letter
from Mr. Lee to me and my reply
to him.
Those men are trying to deceive
the Farmers’ Union, and I feel it a
duty to expose them. After that, the
Union itself will decide what is best
to be done.
Zsl>e S 3 offers oh tan
Mr. Duckworth’s letter to you is a
shameless subterfuge. The resolu
tions which he supported in the Gal
veston Convention were prepared by
the Merchant Marine League, of
Cleveland, Ohio. This League comes
down from the time of Mark Hanna,
and is a Republican affair out and
out. It is financed with the money
of Republicans, chiefly the big manu
facturers and railroad combines
which want the Ship Subsidy. This
Ohio League, composed mainly of
Yankees and Republicans of the
stand-pat type, are publishing a
magazine known as The American
Flag. In this magazine they publish
exactly the same kind of stuff that
Mr. Duckworth published in his pa
per over the signature of T. J.
Brooks. Jackson, of Texas, at about
the same time, used exactly the same
x data, and almost the same language.
Each of these three men apparently
acted in concert, in accordance with
some secret understanding. At any
rate, all of their figures, facts and arr
guments came from The American
Flag, which is published by the
League which is working for the
Subsidy.
Now, the League was too sharp to
use the word “subsidy” in those reso
lutions. They wanted to come up on
the blind side of the Farmers’ Union
without frightening anybody by the
odious term “Ship Subsidy”—which
had been made unpopular by an ex
posure of what it meant —so they left
out the words “Ship Subsidy,” but
the resolutions were hailed by The
American Flag, and various other
Ship Subsidy periodicals, as a tri
umph of the Ship Subsidy people.
In other words, my dear friend,
Mr. Duckworth is presuming that the
farmers are too ignorant to know
that in this connection the Merchant
Marine and the Ship Subsidy are ex
actly the same thing. The Republi
cans are trying to revive—as they
claim it —our Merchant Marine by
taking money out of the common
Treasury and giving it to a few
‘ transcontinental railroads, which
operate steamship lines. None of
those who are booming the Merchant
Marine are asking for anything else
but subsidies, —from Gallinger, of
New York, down to Brooks, of Ten
nessee, they are clamoring for some
form of subsidy; therefore, Mr.
Duckworth resorted to a subterfuge,
which he thought would fool you,
when he said that that speech was
for the Merchant Marine and not for
the Ship Subsidy.
I suggest that you drop him a let
ter and ask liim to explain the differ
ence between Merchant Marine and
Ship Subsidy. In this connection ask
him to tell you how he proposes to
increase the number of ocean-going
vessels that are carrying the Ameri
can Flag.
In last week’s Jeffersonian, you
will find a statement about the num
ber of ships owned by this country
and others. The United States have
sailing vessels and ocean-going
steamers in excess of 25,000.
There must be at least 75,000 sailing
vessels and ocean-going vessels be
longing to the other countries of the
world, —perhaps 100,000 would not
be too large a figure. Now, can you
not see at a glance that a little sub
sidy of five million dollars taken out
of our Treasury every year w’ould
not have any appreciable effect on
the competition of 100,000 merchant
marine vessels? It wouldn’t be a
drop in the pond, to say nothing of a
drop in the bucket.
Why is it, therefore, that they
want to take that five million dollars
out of the common Treasury on the
pretence of building up a Merchant
Marine? It is simply; and solely for
the purpose of putting money in the
pockets of the magnates who build
ships and of the transcontinental
railroads which own them-
Now, as to Mr. Lee and his letter.
If John Lee does not know that while
Mr. Grady, of Kentucky, was elected
in the open session of the Birming
ham Convention, Bodenhamer was
also elected at a secret night meet
ing of a chosen few, then he himself
is as ignorant of what Duckworth,
Bodenhamer and Ladson are up to
as the rank and file members
throughout the State. If what I have
said about this is not true, why
doesn’t Duckworth deny it in his pa
per? Why doesn’t Mr. Lee deny it
in the Constitution, or in some other
public way? Why are they afraid to
face me in the open?
As a matter of fact, they did send
Bodenhamer as the representative
of the Farmers’ Union to a conven
tion of the International Typographi
cal Union, held at St. Joseph, Mis
souri, —at least he says so. Did you
know’ that? Did John Lee know it?
Why are they keeping such things
secret? What are they up to, any
way?
As to that Neal Bank business, Mr.
Lee is badly off the track. Under
our law’, the officials who loaned
$120,000 to any one man, on any
kind of security, violated the law\
The truth is that Mr. Ladson roped
in a couple of the officials of the
Bank to take part in the speculation
in the hopes of getting a share of the
profits. How else can you explain
their conduct in violating the law in
lending such a huge sum of money
to any one man for a distant specula
tion in Cuba? Your own common
sense will suggest to you that the
officials of the Bank were to share
in the profits expected on the deal.
As to that deal having cleared such
a large amount of money, why is it
then that those of us who had money
on deposit in the Bank have only
got 5o per cent, of our money back,
when this is the third w’inter since
the Bank was wrecked? Why is it
that Mr. Ladson doesn’t publish his
reply in the Union News, or in the
Constitution? Why doesn’t he sue
me for slander, if I have been pub
lishing falsehoods against him? Why
is it that they content themselves
