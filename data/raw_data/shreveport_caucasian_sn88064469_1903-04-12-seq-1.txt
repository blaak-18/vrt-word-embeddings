A HORRIBLE CRIME
Murdered In Her Bed at Her Home
In This City.
MRS. ALICE MATTHEWS THE VICTIM OF A NEGRO BURGLAR.
HER DAUGHTER ALINE IS ALMOST KILLED WITH AN AX.
A CLUE LEADS TO A LIVELY CHASE-THE CULPRIT,
ED PORTER, WAS KILLED BY TýL POLICE.
A horrible crime was perpetrated dttr
ing Friday nnoght, or rather after mid
night, perhaps between 3 and 4 o'clock
Saturday morning. in a home where a
number of people resided, in a two
story dwelling at the corner of Crockett
and Common 'streets. where the neigh
bors' houses are within easy touch, in,
we may say, the very heart of the city.
It was not until about 6 o'clock or a
little later that he crime was discovered
by the cook; M1ary Wells, and the h&ise
maid, Jennie Steins, who came as
usual to ll6gin their work of the
day. As the kitchen dpor was reached
there was a startling footprint in blood.
and when the door leading into the
room of the victim was opened there
was a ghastly scene which shocked, in
expressibly the cook, who with the maid
raised the alarm, iwhen the household
were awakened asswell as the near
neighbors.
It was a shocking discovery, which
chilled the blood and for a moment was
indescribably startling. Ip giving the
details of the crime no sensational,
imaginary picture or words can add to
.its horror. It is a- crime which is most
revolting, the murder of a woman,
killed in her own room, on her bed, and
the assault which may terminate fatally
to the little daughter Aline, aged about
ro years, who slept beside her mother.
TIte trictp in this instance was Mrs.
Id m at * *ich she accomhio
dated with meals every day about thirty
five people, married and single. The
first floor of this house con: ists of a
hallway in which there is a piano and
several pieces of fu-niture. Adjoining
the hall is a spacious apartment which
was converted into a dining room, and
in the rear is a room whose back door
opens ,directly into the kitchen. The 1
rooms on the second floor were occupied 1
by a nanber of well known people,,
among whom was Mr. H. F. Doll, Jr.,
who but recently married a daughter of 1
Mrs. Matthews, and Miss Patty Mat
thew,; daughter, andl Porter Matthews,
her son, a young man aged 21 years,
wl o is a salesman' at Kaufman's book
store. From the kitchen an exit by a side
door, leds into the yard, where there is
a woodshed, and nearby is a pile where
there has been coat and wood, and at
which an ax was left. A small gate leads
iVto the alley. from, the yard.
What was the motive: of the crime?
The police, authorities, the sheriff and
his deputies and men who have assisted
in: ferreting crime are baffled. The best
trained dog was brought toy, the scene to
take the trail, but this sagacious animal
failed after repeated attempts to follow
the trail, which was lost with others
who had treaded in the path of the mur
derer.
What was he motive? It,was in our
opinion robbery and nothing more, al
though there has been ascribed another
motive, the thought of which .is blood
curdling.
Our theory is that the murderer con
templated robbery. As he came through
the' alley and stepped into the yard by
the gate he saw the ax.conveniently at
hand. " He seited it' and walked on
through the kitchen, through the door
way against which there rested a piece
of' stove wood as a prop to .keep this
door "from closing. Without digressing
if may be said that before retirin6 for
the night 'trs., Mattlihevs had stated that
she intended-to leave tat poison in the
kitchen with which to kill rats, and it is
ieasonable to assume that she left the
kitchen door opened with the prop of
wood against it. However, through the
Sedi g~ he'i htruder 'reached the kitch
en and by tunhtg to the right he was
aths dog r W3dipg to the room of Mrs.
Mattheaws. Astlhere' are .nto indications
abeetthis'door of its b ing been forced
open, the statiral inference is that it was
unloc ?4 la this por was the key with
ti handle ts the i lside This door, be
ing opened the intruder had easy access
into the roon inst as he entered Mrs.
Aken~ed, whlia
about the body. A second blow from the
ax silenced her forever. When found the
body was partly outstretched on the bed.
near the body ofthe mother was her
daughter, Aline. who was lbelieved to be
lifeless. Awakening wlien her mother
was being murdered, she received two
blows with the same ax on the skull,
and then the murderer left hurriedly -
this scene of blood, taking nothing with
him. On Mrs. Matthews' hands were
valuable rings of diamonds and precious
stones, which were found on her fingers
as she wore them. Her earrings were un
disturbed in her ears. As the murderer
left, he trod in his victim's blood, and an
imprint of his footsteps would indicate
that he was shoeless but wore his socks.
To ou rmind the motive was robbery,
and the fear of detection led to the
crime of murder. As to who is the crim
inal may be conjectured. As a rule the
ax is the weapon used by the negro, but t
there are instances when the ax has been 1
wielded with deadly effect by white
men. The _ crime, as we repeat, is suf- -
ficiently horrible when narrated in the
cold letter of the facts and needs no
lurid effects to picture the stern reality -
which is shocking in the extreme.
Who is the murderer? Ah, for the
present he may conceal his identity, but
murder l out, and may be the crimi
nal mawy in custody when the narra
tion o crimte is perused by rera

Mrs. Prank Matthews, the unfortun
ate victim, was a most estimable lady.
She was from Kentucky and had resid- [
ed about five years in Shreveport, She(
was conducting a first class. boarding
house with great success, as was attest- [
ed by her popularity. She had a son, 1
Porter Matthews, and three daughters,
Mrs. Howard Doll, Jr., Miss Patty Mat
thews and Aline Matthews. Her bus-*
band,- Frank Matthews, a civil engineer,
resided in Alabama and was in the em
ploy of the Sea Board Air Line. He has
been advised of his misfortune and is 1
expected to reach this city today.
THREE MURDERED
Within the nast eighteen months three
women have been murdered in the lim
its of Shreveport; one, a negress, in
Silver Lake bottom,, who was butchered
with an ax; the second was t% old
faithful s~rvant killed in her room at
the home of Mr. Tobinsky, with a billet
of wood; and the deplorable murder of
Mrs. .Matthews, and probably her daugh
ter, with an ax. The murderer, a negro,
of the woman in Silver Laki has eluded
arrest, but the negro who killed the
faithful nurse has been convicted and
may hang. The murderer of Mrs. Mat
thews will no doubt be apprehended and
brought to swift punishment.
ACTIVITY OF THE POLICE AND
ALIIYJIX Yt orIri JfULILI_. AINIJ
THE SHERIFF.
When the crime was made known to
the police, Lieutenant Basch being in
charge, he put the whole machinery, of
the police, as it were, in full operation,
notified Chief Jones, who came* quickly
to the scene, and who together exerted
every effort to secure the criminal.
There was no clue, only the bloody ax
and the bloody footprints on the floor,
but the police were diligent and watch
ful.
JURY OF INQUEST.
Soon after the crime had been re
ported, Dr. Cnty, coroner, summoned a
jury of inquest, who, after a partial in
quiry, adjourned for additional infor
mation.
ALINE MATTHEWS.
When the crime was discovered and
it was ascertained that Aline Matthews
was not dead, she was removed to
Schumpert's Skiitarium, where she has,
all the care which can be suggested by
medical science and the attention which'
loveful sympathetic hands can give. Her
condition is precarois nnd she may not

A CLUE TO THE CRIME.
When it seemed as if the best efforts
to unravel the mysterious murder would
be unavailing, there was received at
police headquarters a note of warning
which was significant-a negro with
blood stains on his shirt and pants had
been seen by a white boy on the K. C. S.
road, which was confirmed by the state
ment of two men connected with the
Kansas City Southern. On receiving this
information the activity of the police
was redoubled, and Chief Jones and
Sheriff Ward each agreed on a plan of
action. Sherift.Ward and a posse tray
el iabe: ; tinof -Wallace, lake,
while Jones had seattered deveral squads:
of police officers, Johnson, Craddock and
HulI, took the trail down the Kansas
City Southern to the Texas and Pacific
and there met Officers Rascoe and others
with a hand-car. After a round up the
party retraced their course, being on the
trail of the fugitive who, however, had
eluded his pursuers. In the meantime
Sergeants (erald and Roquemore were
on foot, traveling briskly, in shirt
sleeves, when they. spied a negro coming
into the rods from the woods. Being
haile he stopped, and when. questioned.
about the bloody spots on his shirt and
pants wheeled around and started on a
awift run, the two officers after . him.
Failing to stop when called, Gerald fired
and then Roquemore fired, and the shot
took effect, wounding the fugitive, who
kept running. After ;a brisk race the ne
gro was killed by the officers near Willie
Willis' home on the kansas Cqty South
ern road five miles from Shreveport.
The negro killed was beyond a doubt the
murderer of Mrs. Matthews.
This fact was dispatched by courier to
Chief Jones, who was in the vicinity in
another direction. In scattering into
squads as they did, it was the purpose
of Sheriff Ward and Chief Jones to cut
off the fugitive and catch him at almost
any point. The body of the fugitive was
put into a two-horse wagon and hauled
to Willis's, the undertaker on Texas ave
nue, from where it will be buried.
The negro killed was aged about .35
years and was known as Ed Porter. He
was employed about the Union Depot
and had relatives in this city.
And so has ended the career of a man
who while intent on robbery, added mur-,
der to his crime, the murder of a mother,
the head of a family, and her daughter,
whose life hangs on a thread, and whose
death would intensify an already horri
ble record. A miserable. life ended, and
as it was, by being shot to death by un
erring hands, iffispholding the law. Bet
ter as it is, better for the people that he,
has been slain.
THE UNFORTUNATE FAMILY.
And now a few words for the afflicted
of the unfortutiate .famity, bereft of a
dear, kind, loving mother, removed as it
were in the twinkling of an eye. Mur
dered! Horrible! but no greater crime
was conmnitted. And the little daughter.
at death's door! What a sad picture!
Dark-and desolate indee4, and there is
no need of increasing with sensational
ism this, picture of a sadness indescrib
able and ine;pressible. But throughout
the gloom there will come the gleam, the
ray of sunshine, the soothing, the heal
ing balm from the Qiver of all Good.
