Sketches from Roman History
The warfare that is being carried on
today against class legislation has

book, in which Mr. Watson deals with
the heroic land reformers of Rome,
the great slave revolt, the tribune of
the people, the brilliant leader of the
aristocrats, and other dramatic scenes
in the history of Rome.

REPUBLICAN HIGH FINANCE.
During the campaign of 1896 the
Republican newspapers and orators
had a great deal to say about “cheap
money. ’ ’
They would not discuss the money
question fairly then, and have neved
done so since.
They pooh-poohed the argument
that what the country needed was
more money, and said all the people
needed was more confidence.
They ridiculed the proposition to
open the mints for silver on the same
terms that the mints have been open
to gold since 1873, and made jokes
about the 16 to 1 ratio in existence
then and in existence now.
They said with an air of great se
riousness that Uncle Sam couldn’t
make a dollar out of 45 cents worth
of silver, notwithstanding the fact
that Uncle Sam was doing that very
thing then and has been doing so ever
since.
They said that the “intrinsic
value” of a dollar must be the same
as its “face value,” and that the sil
ver dollar oug'.ht to be as a cart wheel
on account of the “commercial value”
of silver.
They said all this and a lot more
rubbish that had nothing- to do with
the question, which wasn’t true then,
is not true now, and never will be
true.
But this little dissertation is not
intended for ia discussion of the
money question. The only object in
view is to remind you of the Republi
can 11 arguments ’ ’ in 1896 and to show
up the inconsistency of one of the
first declared policies of a Republican
administration today in view of those
‘ ‘ arguments. ’ ’
In his 3-minute message to con
gress at the beginning of the special
session to “revise” the tariff upward,
downward and crossways for the sole
benefit of the trusts, President Taft
estimated that by July Uncle Sam
would have a deficit of $100,000,000.
To meet this deficit and to provide
temporarily against its continuance it
has been proposed to issue $150,000,-
000 in “treasury certificates,” or
“debt certificate,” or whatever name
the word-jugglers at Washington
choose to call them.
The plain people are not supposed
to understand, 'but the fact is that
these “certificates” are to be put out
in the form of paper money.
Which means that when one Repub
lican administration goes out of office
$100,000,000 in debt the next Republi
can administration that comes along
will turn that debt into money by
issuing “certificates,” which doesn’t
reduce the debt, because it is merely
an issue of bonds under another name.
Isn’t that a fine example of “high
finance” to fool the gullible 1 ?
Here is a Republican administra
tion only <a dozen years after, all the
clamor about “dishonest dollars” and
“cheap money*’ and agonizing asser
tions that “you can’t make a dollar
out of 45 cents worth of silver,” (actu
ally proposing to make 150,000,000
dollars out of a $100,000,000 deficit
in the treasury. That is making a
dollar out of 100 cents less than noth
ing. Tn other words a deficit dollar.
It is a long straddle from a 45
cent dollar to a deficit dollar, but a
Republican administration is capable

ASTOUNDING IMPUDENCE OF
THE ALDRICH PROCEDURE.
Senator Aldrich is frank, very
frank. He is frank in his disclosures
of the present purpose of his party
to maintain, even to increase, the
Dingley rates, disregarding altogether
the demand of the people for a. de
crease of the tariff burden, and throw
ing to the winds the “true principle
of protection” declared in the repub
lican platform that the duties im
posed should be such “as will equal
the difference between the cost of
production at home and abroad, to
gether with a reasonable profit tc
American industries.” Mr. Aldrich
is most commendably frank, too, we
may even say he is stern, in his re
buke to congress for its reckless ex
travagance. He insists that the scale
of expenditure recently adopted is
wasteful and unnecessary, and he de
clares that in the fiscal year 1911
there must be a reduction of $35,000,-
000 in disbursements. If this is done,
the provisions of the Aldrich bill will,
in his judgment enable the treasury to
make both ends meet.
Senator« Aldrich submits to the sen
ate estimates prepared with the as
sistance of treasury experts, showing
that the rates of duty fixed in his bill,
if applied to the importations of 1907,
would have yielded $8,000,000 more
revenue than was actually collected
under the Dingley act.
This statement we may say at once,
is one of sublime hardihood, but the
calm language of the Rhode Island
senator affords no evidence that he is
conscious of the degree to which his
admission disappoint the expecta
tions of the people and falsifies the
promises of his party. We were to
have the tariff revised because the
burdens it imposes are too ' severe
longer to be borne, and because we
have outgrown the necessity for the
protection which many of its sched
ules provide. Instead of that, Mr.
Aldrich and his committee submit a
bill that actually increases the Ding
ley extortions! The impudence of the
procedure is astounding, but we do
not see what the people are going to
do about it; we do not see even what
they can do about it. Mr. Bryan has
reduced the democratic party, to a
condition that makes it possible for
the republicans to do with entire im
punity what the standpatters believe,
or what the protected interests de
mand. —New York Times.
