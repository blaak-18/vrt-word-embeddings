Huron Picnic.
The picnic given by the ",Huron
Social Club" on the 4th of July,
proved 'an event in. the history of
that quiet 'little hamlet, that will
.lways be looked backed to, by
who were present, with feelings
-of l~ ition and pleasure.
Early in te morning of the day,
more glorious` than all others, the
club and its guE4s gathered at a
point near the station, and in form
of procession numbering fully 250,
wended their way to a beautiful spot
on the banks of the Teche, where
they were to pass the day in joy and
pleasure. The dinner or rather the
feast, which consisted of everything
nice, in the -way of meats, fruit,
cake and wine, were spread in in
viting array 'neath the branches of
majestic oaks, by 'nature draped
with moss in every shade of green,
which waving to and fro under the
gentle influences of a delightful
breeze, seemed to speak a welcome
to the beautiful ladies and hand
some men who were about to in
dulge in the meal, that would de
light the most fastidious.
The Huron Club may well con
gratulate itself on the success of its
celebration of our nation's natal
day, while its guests will always
remember it collectively and indi
vidually with sincere feelings of
gratitude.
The following are the officers
and members:
Mr. F. F. Merwin, president;

Mr. Mouton's School Bill.
Special to The Times-Democrat
Baton Rouge, July 7.-Mr. Mouton, of
Lafayette, who has so actively followed the
fortunes of his school bill, No. 48. which
provides that religious or sectarian schools
shall not be combined with the State public
schools, has been made happy by seeing it
become a law. There was considerable
opposition to the bill from Mr. Mouton's
own parish, and when the bill was sent to
the :enate two of the opponents of the
measure made haste to reach the Capitol in
time to influence final action. Mr. Mouton,
in conjunction with Senator Montgomery,
made several changes in the bill prior to the
arrival of the delegates, who, when they
arrived, found their kick forestalled. The
merits of the bill have been generally recog
nized, and no oppposition was made to its
passage.
T''he above statement that op
ponents of the school bill in this
parish sent delegates to Baton
Rouge to prevent its passage is
erroneous. The gentlemen who
went to the capitol for the purpose
of defeating the measure were from
St. Martin parish and not frohi
Royville Itemns.
From Our Regular Correspondent.
-Having been notified by several
of our readers, that unless our"Items"
reappeared in their usual column,
our scalp was" in danger. We are
not yet ready to say "howdy" for
ever, and for that reason, the Roy
ville Items are again in print this
week. Our friends should know
that "Cherokee" had a mild touch
of malaria. He is now better and
of course, still in the ring.
-Tl'he long continued drouth, is
being felt in certain sections, with
disastrous effects to crops, gardens
and stock.
-Mr. Aristide Domingue, of Lake
Simonet, whilst driving his cows
from his pasture last Tuesday, was
struck by lightning and instantly
killed. The deceased was an honest
and an upright gentleman. To his
bereaved wife and little children,
we tender our heartfelt sympathy.
-Misses Lea Gladu, of Lafayette,
and Marie Moise, of New Orleans,
spent Tuesday in town, guests of the
Misses Scranton.
-The lovely " Miss Little
Hatchet" has been mercilessly
"scozed" lately. Would it be other
wise, we would certainly come to
her rescue, but being one of the
many who severely condemn the
Stnday law, we cannot but say,
that hei "say-so" hereafter should
be restricted' to other "laws" govern
ing exclusively household matters.
-Misses Cornay and Young,
charming young ladies from Lafay
ette, where visiting Dr. Young's
family the past week.
--With the exception of a fistic
encounter, a widower's wedding; a
,"charivarie,"and a deafening racket,
the glorious 4th was unobserved in
Royville.
-A tiny little bit of feminity
with headquarters at the Scranton
mansion, made herself known last
Saturday. Mother and child
doing well.
-Mortalities for the past week
were: Mr. Honore Broussard, Mrs.
Antony Hidalgo, and a little child,
daughter of Mr. Adrien Sellers.
To all the grief-stricken relatives
we offer our deepest condolence.
-It is with pleasure that we re
port Mrs. P. B. Roy's full recovery
from her late illness.
-Very Rev. Father Grimeaux, a
survivor of the late Caminada
storm, has - charge of the Roy
ville parochial district during
Father Ghabier's absence.
-Oh! give us, everytime, the
balmy country air, where one can
leave doors, without being struck
by stones, or riddled with
the troops' hot lead.
--Hon. Wim. Campbell, mayor
of Lafayette, and a *prominent
attorney, in company with Officer
Romero, spent Sunday fishing and
sailing at Lake Peigneur.
-Mr, Edward Parent is apply
ing for a position in the postal ser
vice of Uncle Sam. Mr. Parent is
a deserving young gentleman, and
we wish him success in securing his
position.
-A sea-coast party, consisting
of Messrs. B. P. Landry, David,
Broussard, Higginbotham, and
others, returned home Saturday.
They all report having had en ex
cellent time. The bathing was
superb, oysters and fish plentiful,
and above all, no mnosqustoes.
One of the party was unfortunate
enough to sprain his arm, causing
him no "little trouble in satisfying
the inner man." CHIEROKEE.

Marvelous Results.
From a letter written by Rev. J. Gunder
man, of Dimondale, Mich., we are permit
ted to make this extract: "I have no hesita
tion in recommending Dr. King's New
Discovery, as the results were almost mar
velous in the case of my wife. While I
was pastor of the Babtist Church at Rives
Junction she was brought down with
Pneumonia succeeding L.a Grippe. Ter
rible paroxysms of coughing would last
hours with little interruption and it seemed
as if she could not survive them. A
friend recommendod Dr. King's New
Dsicovery; it was quick in its work and
highly satisfactory in results" Trial bottles

Mr. Thibodaux came to this parish

happy in the Christian religion,
before his death, and expressed him

Sunday Law Again.
DosoN, LA., July 9, 5894.
To the Lafayette CGaette:
I saw in your last two issues a communica
tions from this part of our parish, one for
and one against the Sunday law. This mat
ter will come too late to be seen by our law
makers this session, nevertheless, I want the
world to how that the loly Sabbath has
many 4tM ds in Lafayette parish. It has
been said that the Sabbath sun never rose
south of Mason and Dixon's line, but, to-clay
this is not so. This day in Louisiana, is fast
becoming as it should be, a day of rest. The
B3ibre says six days we shall labor and rest on
the seventh. Now to do away with the Sun
day law, open the abominibal whisky saloons
and carry on buying and selling on that day
is a stigma on the fair name of Louisiana.
Man and every annimal that works needs at
least one day's rest in seven. Shall it be
said of us that we have no fear of God's laws.
While it may be possible that there are some
who have no God the large majority of this
parish, at least, are God-fearing people. Now,
Mr. Editor, I will not claim too much of your
space on this subject, as I see the bill before
the Legislature has a majority of opponents.
We farmers are out of sorts; no rain; crops
suffering; rice is badly injured; old corn will
be very light; cotton is fine, and is better
than any other crop, except tobacco. There
will be no fruit, except figs this year. on
account of the late freezes. Pastures are good;
our stock are very fat, although we have to
pump water for them. I am plowing and
scrapering out a hole too by 30 feet, 3 feet
deep to water my stock. I will fence it in
plant willows to keep it cool; I have a trough
leading outside for them to drink in.
We had a grand Sunday School picnic on
the 4th of July at Indian Bayou church. The
Sunday schools of Vermillion and Lafayette
held a convention.
Many good wishes for the Gazette,
OBERON.
Captain W. Graser, of the Perse
verance Base Ball Club, authorized
The Gazette to say that his club
would be delighted to play a game
with the Bayou Carencro Club.

The Wedding Bells
Were pealing forth joyous sounds
on last Tuesday evening in com
memoration of the happy union of
Mr. H. Jagou, of this, place,to Miss
Rosa Fortune, of Berwick City.
The wedding took place at the resi
dence of the bride's uncle, Mr. A.
Labe, at 8:30 p. m. Only a few
immediate friends and relatives of
the groom and bride were present.
I congratulate the groom for being
so fortunate in securing through
life's journey so beautiful and
lovely a helpmate, and the many
friends of the groom and his fairest
flower, the Rose, which was plucked
from the garden of Berwick City,
join the writer in a fervent wish
that foot prints which they will
trace upon the sands of time will
indicate a long, happy, and useful
wedded existence. A FRIEND.
OBITUARY.
Charles H. Voorhies died Tues
day evening at the hospital in New
Orleans, at the age of 33 years. At
his bedside stood his devoted wife
who had accompanied him to New
Orleans, little thinking that he
would be brought back to their home
in St. Martinville a corpse.
Charles Voorhies,was in the fullest
sense of the word, a true friend.
Perhaps impulsive at times, but
always true as steel and brave as a
lion. All who knew him well, will
bear testimony to his big heart,
which never failed to respond to the
calls of charity. His hand was ever
ready to extend help to the needy.
In his nature there was a total
absence of selfishness. What be
longed to him, belonged to his
friends.
In his native town, St. Martinville,
where he lived to the time of his un
timely death, his many deeds of
charity and kindness will always
serve as tokens of his generous
nature.
He leaves behind a beloved wife
and three little children to mourn
his death, which seems to have
come so suddenly and so unexpect
edly, at a time when his fatherly
care was so much needed. Death
is always sad, but it is doubly so
when the victim is a man of family.
When it strikes at the home, rob
bing it of the head, and leaving a
void that is never filled.
Poor Charley, your death has
caused many a heart to suffer the
pangs of sorrow and disappointment.
While you lived there was a home
of joy and contentment; but to-day,
that home is the scene of sorrow
and mourning. Yesterday, the
merry laughter of children was
heard there; to-day, it is the sobs
of the grief-strcken widow and of
dear little ones. May God, in His
infinite mercy, assuage their grief,
is the sincere wish of A FRIEND.
