A newspaper editor, who was a

of “slimy graft.” The influence of

The determination (?) of the Gov

My, my; here’s Woodrow Wilson

And the Chinese are showing some
more what a very weak brand of
“conversion” they have been absorb

24,000 native Chinese took part, have

American missionaries have been

BEE KEEPING FOR FARMERS.
Locating the Hives and Feeding the
Bees.
I have received a number of let
ters asking for information on va
rious points in bee keeping. “How
would you locate the hives?” If
convenient, place them in a line un
der a row of plum trees, with the
openings to the south, so that the
sun will strike them early, and yet
be warded off during the heat of the
day. I put mine on a platform about
two feet high, so I won’t have to
stoop so much in working with them,
and also to keep them away from the
damp ground.
To protect my hives from cold in
winter and from severe heat in sum
mer, I put an extra box over them,
opening at the front. The cover
should be separate so as to come off
without removing the whole box
when you want to go into the hive.
In our mild climate this outer box
does not need to be close, like chaff
hives in the North.
The floor of the platform and the
bottom board of the hive should
slope a little to the front, in order to
keep well drained, but from side to
side, they should be level, so the
combs will hang true. The alighting
board should be sufficiently ample to
prevent tired bees from falling short
in the grass, to be lost in cold or
wet weather.
Spring dwindling is one of the
greatest mishaps with which the bee
keeper has to contend. The time va
ries according to latitude. If the bees
are not well supplied with stores
when they go into winter quarters,
they are apt to run short during the
cold, rainy days of spring. Some
morning you will find the alighting
boards covered with dead bees, and
then you know that nothing but
vigorous feeding can save your colo
nies.
It is mo&t satisfactory to feed bees
at the bottom from the rear. To
feed in front incurs risk of robbing.
To feed at the top requires the cover
to be removed, which is not conven
ient. A division board system al-
131)4 Jeffersonian
lows the escape of bees. We have
found no system so simple and satis
factory as feeding on a level with the
bottom board at the rear. With the
right feeder, it is simplicity itself,
and the work can be done rapidly
and without any unpleasant inci
dents.
Surplus, or refuse honey, is the
best feeding material, but most bee
keepers feed sugar dissolved in its
own measure of warm water. Feed
should be given after all the bees are
in at night, so as to prevent tempta
tion to rob. Give as much as the
bees will clean up, and store in time
for next feed on the following day.
Some colonies will need more feed
and some less, while others may
need none at all. When the hive
feels heavy on lifting-the back end
there is no need for feeding. If it is
light, feed should be given. Its exact
condition may be ascertained by
opening the hive and examining the
combs. —T. C. Karns, in Progressive
Farmer.
FOR GOOD HAY CROPS.
Cowpeas.
The cowpea is the most generally
grown and most valuable hay and
forage in the South. It can be
grown anywhere, and covers a longer
season of growth than any other. It
furnishes large quantities of nutri
tious feed stuff and, besides, builds
up the soil rapidly by furnishing ni
trogen and humus.
The soil should be well prepared,
as for any other farm crop. Poor
preparation is the cause of most of
the apparent failures with this crop.
For very early use the Whippoor
will or the New Era variety can be
sown early in April in rows 30 inches
apart with a corn planter, one-half
bushel of seed per acre. Cultivate
well, and where land is not fertile
use 200 pounds of acid phosphate
and 50 pounds of cottonseed meal per
acre to give vigorous growth. Plant
ed in this way cowpeas will give a
heavy crop of grain and vines for hay
in early summer.
For later crops, and where a very
heavy yield is desired, the Clay, Un
known or some other well-known va
riety may be used.
Hay made from pea vines planted
in this way supplies ordinary work
stock with complete rations at a sea
son when most needed.
Cowpeas and Sorghum.
Where preferred and when it is not
specially desirable to have very early
hay, sorghum and cowpeas may be
sown together broadcast, one-half
bushel of sorghum to one and one
half bushels of cowpeas per acre.
Amber sorghum and some early va
riety of cowpeas will mature quickly,
but for heavy yields Orange sorghum
and a running variety of cowpeas
should be used.
The land should be well broken
and thoroughly prepared before sow
ing the seed. This point must be ob
served in all cases.
Velvet Beans.
In the Gulf States, and on poor
soils especially, the velvet bean will
be found a profitable crop. It makes
a very luxuriant growth, requires lit
tle cultivation, and when planted
early will mature large quantities of
seed, sufficient to be pastured off by
cows and hogs. The vine is too rank
and coarse for hay, but adds more
fertility to the soil than any of the
legumes on account of its growth and
its root system.
The seed is cheaper than soy beans
or cowpeas, as one bushel will be suf
ficient to plant four or five acres. For
building up very poor soils it ranks
first among legumes, both as to cost
and efficiency.—Farmers’ Union Sun.

Mr. S. M. Gardenhire’s remedy for
bribery in the Legislature is to put
all the penalties on the bribed and
let the briber go free. The reasons
for his belief in the expediency of
this method are set forth in the cur
rent number of the North American
Review. The gist of his argument
is that as the law now stands the
briber and the bribee must protect
each other, since, if one is caught,
both are likely to be caught. The
natural witness against the bribee is
the briber, but in self-defence he
avoids giving testimony. If the law
relieved the briber from all fear of
punishment he would have the
bribee absolutely in his power. Ex-
Senator Ben Conger, late of Albany,
is a proper man to discuss it. As a
giver of bribes he brought down ex
posure on Senator Allds, who took
his money, but having done that
service, he had himself to resign
from the Senate of New York.—

PLAIN TRUTH
A MONTHLY MAGAZINE, 32 PAGES
By J. A. SCARBORO,
A Son of Georgia, Minister and
Student.
This Magazine is digging’ up and
exposing corruption and graft in
“Missions”. Its Editor has studied
the subject fifteen years, published
two books on the subject and knows
what he is doing. Dr. J. N. Hall,
late Editor of the Baptist Flag, the
most widely circulated Baptist pa
per in the South, with whom Scar
boro was associated as Editor of
that paper, said of him: “J. A. Scar
boro is the best informed man on
missions in America." The cham
pions of the present system have
declined to meet him in both press
and on rostrum. His Magazine is
full of facts, evidence and argu
ments which can not be refuted. He
is Treasurer of the General Asso
ciation of Baptist Churches, and has
the confidence and enjoys the en
dorsement of his brethren. He is
Pastor of one of the best churches
in the land and just in his prime
and in the thickest of the battle for
truth and righteousness.
