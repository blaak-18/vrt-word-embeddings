The first of the year was cele- go I
brated in a very effective manner at con
the railroad yards. At midnight thei
Masters H. B. Allingham and L. the
Nickerson caused engine 705 to mox
whistle as a signal to the others,
and in less time than we an tell it, Let
the other engines folllowed. The
noise produced can better be imag
ine than described.
We are informed by J. T. Alling- blt

important meeting at their hall last coni
Tuesday. Three applications were plea
received and sent to the medical of o
examiner. Another meeting will be to
held on Jan. x6, at 7:3o p. m. All
members are earnestly requested to tion
attend. are
We are happy to state that our mer- the
chants did a good business during retu
the holidays. With but few excep- T
tions,; the 6i1ea dO-isot complain
that business was io brisk and rush
ar so big and cpatinuous that they
could not .go home on New Year's
day and get a piece of turkey. Cold
lunch might do on all other days,
ad but on this gaeat holiday the aver.
or age clerk will not be contented with
it, unless the rush is as large as
lis those we sometimes read about.
es It is wonderful the amount of pure,
unadulterated nerve some people
ay possess. We are in receipt of a let
he ter from the manager of one of
the largest hotels in the South de
ly scribing his house in the most
of glowing terms. He adds that our
patrons would be delighted to know
s, of this house. Probably they would,
is but the letter is. an advertisement,
pure and simple, and we failed to
it see any coin a*mpanying it, or
any postscript, etc., stating that
the "stuff' wouild follow. Now, we
want to state- for the benefit of this
party that we also run a hotel, on a
a small scale, 'tis frue--ourself
being the only guest-but
r- quite large enough to keep us hust
* ling. We also run this paper, the
money derived from the publication
11 of which, goes, for the most part,
r. to the maintenance of our hotel.
u In other words, we print advertise
ments for money.
t- A Letter From Mr. Leslie.
n The Business Men's Association
d received, a few days ago, a letter
from Mr. Lesslie, in regard to the
w railroad which that gentlemen prom

read the letter, but we are informed
that Mr. Leslie expresses his readi- 6
ness to carry out his proposition. r
e Assaulted by "Hobos."
A stranger with an -ugly cut on
his head called on Marshal Vigneaux n
and stated that he had been as
saulted by tramps. The officer, ac- re
e companied by the railroad men who
are always ready to volunteer their S
services for anything of this kind, ti
wenf to the brick yard where the
"hobos" generally congregate.
They surrounded the yard and cap- to
tured ten tramps and marched them al
to the jail where the wounded ia
man identified two of them as his
assaillants. di
Married. i
In New Orleans, Jan. I, 1894, by sa
Lkcv. Blackwell, at the residence of the fu
bride's mother, Mr. O. Hi. Sinron and Miss Si
Maly Arir-.
Mr. bimlpson was almost reared in Lafa
yette, and nas., lived here up to a few months
ago, when he left to take charge of a position
of trust in the New Orleans Mlint to which W
he had been appointed by Superintendent L,
Cade. He is one of our brightest young
men, popular with all classes, and posseses Wi
many friends here who wish him and his
young wife much happiness. Fr
The Ball on New Year's Eve.
The young men who gave the ds
ball at Falk's Hall last Sunday night
may justly feel proud of the success cr
which crowned their efforts on this I
occasion, as the ball proved a most
brilliant affair, and will long be re
membered by those who attended as A.
one of the most enjoyable social
events of the year 1893. At an le
early hour people from this and ad- th
joining towns began to arrive, and at m
9 o'clock over sixty couples, led by
Mr. Emanuel Pellerin and Miss
Aline Richard, placed themselves in so
position for the opening march, cl
which presented a most charming
spectacle. Exactly at midnight the
sweet strains of the Breaux Bridge be
band summoned the dancers to a
second grand march, with Mr
R. B. Martin and Miss Octavie Tc
Cayret in the lead. Durming and w
after the mlarch the guests were
treated to a display of fireworks. of
Refreshments were of the best, the we
decorations were neat, the music
was excellent, and all seemed to en- pu
joy themselves to their hearts' con- e
tent. It was late in the night when las
the band played "After the Ball," en
which the dancers understood to be He
a gentle reminder that the time to wil
go home had come. The Gazette gri
compliments the young men on Ib
their success and desires to express ewJ
the hope that they will give many
more such balls during 1894. mi
