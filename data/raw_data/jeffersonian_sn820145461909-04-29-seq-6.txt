ZETTE2LV EROW THE PEOPLE
STANDING BY PRINCIPLES.
Xenia, 111.
Mr. Thomas E. Watson,
Dear iSir: Hoping you a world of
success to the end that justice to the
masses may yet be triumphant.
I am standing by the noble princi
ples that were enunciated in the be
ginning of the reformation and those
that have been added, such as the'
Initiative and Referendum, with the
full legal tender money plank strictly
adhered to. I believe in a few years,
under the damnable system of con
traction and expansion such as now
exist, we would be able to carry the
country in the interest of the masses.
I am an old soldier of 67 years, and
will not, perhaps, live to see any
change, but shall ever pray there
will be.
Yours truly.
R. M. Reece.
EVERY MINISTER SHOULD READ
IT.
Route 1, Flowers Branch, Ga.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
My dear Sir: I am in receipt of the
April number of your most valuable
magazine, and have read with the
most intense interest, your able edi
torial, on the subject of missions, and
must say, that it is the ablest exposi
tion, from a Bible standpoint of the
relation of church and state that I
have ever read, or heard from press
on pulpit. It should be carefully and
earnestly read by every true lover of
religious and political liberty. It
certainly accords with the teaching of
the meek and lowly Nazarene who
spoke as never man spoke.
I have two sons, in the Baptist
ministry and shall insist that they
prayerfully read it, and cease to cen
sure the writer. Every evangelical
minister of the Gospel should do like
wise.
May an all-wise God continue to
bless and guide you m the great work
you are doing for reform through the
two Jeffersonians, is the earnest
prayer of your “ fellow-helper to the
truth.”

LINCOLN NOT AN ABOLITIONIST.
Waco, Texas, April 10, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Atlanta, Ga.
Dear Sir: I took your magazine
when it was published in New York
and have read your history of France
and Napoleon and your Biography of
Lincoln, and think they are all good
except what you say of Lincoln’s con
version to abolitionism. Knowing
Herndon and Lincoln from my youth
up, have heard them both deny most
positively that they were abolition
ists. I am now seventy-four years
old, and have been a life-long Demo
crat until recently, and now I am a
Socialist Democrat. I believe if capi
tal does not now own the republic that
the people (Socialist) will have to
owm it to keep capital from owning
it and suppressing the people.
Please answer this at your earliest
convenience, and oblige
Yours very truly,
T. B. Bennett.
Ed. Note: What we said was that
Herndon’s influence was what caused
Lincoln to finally align himself with
the abolitionists. He was not origi
nally a pro-niggerite, and never did,
at heart, become one. He simply
went with his people as they organ
ized against slavery.

FROM A BAPTIST PREACHER.
My Dear Mr. Watson: Please find
enclosed card and receipt which will
entitle me to the two Jeffersonians
for fifteen months, as per proposition.
I want to say to you that I fully
agree with you on the foreign mis
sion question. I am an ordained min
ister of the Baptist church; lost all
hope of any reform in our methods by
work on the old members of our
churches. I quit the pastoral work,
and have devoted all my time to Sun
day school wort? among the young peo
ple to educate them along lines of in
dependent thought, or, in other
words, to apply “horse sense” to our
religion.
I have been teaching the mission
question, that it is like “leaven cast
in three measures of meal.” Now
apply the ‘ ‘ horse sense ’ ’ to this
figure and see what th° plan would
be.
First. The nature of leaven is to Ao
its work as it comes to it, and it
does not seek more meal to leaven
until it has leavened all the meal it
comes in contact with. Clearly, then,
it does not leave the place in the meal
it was hid and “jump” to some othei
part and leaven a little spot, then
jump to 'another part, etc.
From the above, the practical order
would be to look after its immediate
community then spread the work as it
came to it until the whole world had
received the same attention.
Well, keep stirring and after all,
perhaps, it will settle right.
Yours very truly,
M.

FROM A METHODIST PREACHER
WHO ISN’T ASLEEP.
Byesville, 0., April 9, 1909.
Mr. Thos. E. Watson, Atlanta, Ga.
My Dear Sir: Please find 50 cents
for your Jeffersonian Magazine six
months, beginning with May number,
1909. Please send specimen of your
weekly. I am a Methodist minister,
and just a little bit radical. I want a
man straight as a tangent along all
lines and not afraid of his shadow.
What can I get on the money ques
tion? I am radically opposed to our
present national bank system. 1
out of the pockets of the people of at
least $600,000,000. The idea of loan*
ing the money to the national banks
at one-half of one per cent and giving
the national banks a right to fleece
the people to the tune of from 7 to 9
per cent is diabolical.
If, after six months, I find that
your magazine strikes oil 'and hits
the “cussedness” and rottenness of
things in general that are rotten, I
will be yours mos|: truly,
W. A.

THE MYSTERY OF 1908.
Dialville, Texas, April 9, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Under separate cover I
am sending you a copy of the Dallas
News containing Bryan’s latest speech
before the Texas Legislature.
I am sending you-this speech, not
for any great wisdom or depth of
thought it may contain, because you
would see at once that I was a big
ger fool than the said W. J. 8., but
rather to furnish you some amuse
ment in finding the solution of the
great “Mystery of 1908.”
Bryan says to us for our consolation
that it is a. wonder we did as well as
we did when w 7 e consider the Repub
lican campaign fund, the
government employees, the tremen
dous newspaper and trust influences
of the Republican party, but he did
not mention an item that he did not
know before the election, if he ever
knew a thing in his life. And yet,
throughout the campaign and even to
the night before the election, he pre
dicted with bombastic garrulity an
overwhelming Democratic victory. He
was wilfully ignorant or maliciously
lied when he made those predictions
if he tells the truth when he brings
this consoling information now.
The “mystery of 1908” will never
be cleared up satisfactorily to the
average Democratic voter. What do
you say?
Yours truly,
C. W.
Ed. Note: Bryan doesn’t mind tell
ing—fibs. Remember how often and
stoutly he denied that his daughter
and her husband had separated, and
that a divorce was contemplated!
Bryan’s defeat is no mystery to
anybody but himself.
TAPS SENATOR BACON AND
LUMBER TRUST.
Douglas, Ga., April 10,1909.
My Dear Sir: After so long I will
send you check for $1.50, per your
offer. I regret very much that lam
not able to pay any more for your
most valuable publications, but, Mr.
Watson, I have just been put through
the mills; that is, closed out of house
and home. I was at work so awful
hard to pay for me one of the most
desirable homes in Coffee county, but
my feet slipped, and speck got it all.
It went into the hands of bankers and
lawyers (this very crowd Senator Ba
con is helping with his lumber tariff).
J. M. Ashley is a banker and saw
mill man, J. W. Quincy is an attorney
and banker, so they must own the
farm. So, hurrah for St. Bacon.
Some day when I get time I will
give you the full details of how I was
scooped, and you can use it on this
ciowd if they ever get on you, but
say nothing now.
I am responsible for you getting
two-thirds of the votes you did get
here, for I did work for you and will
do so again. w
Yours for the cause,
J.

DISCUSSING THE GAME LAWS.
Douglasville, Ga., April 10, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I have just read in the
Jeffersonian of the Sth inst an ar
ticle from Messrs. Hopkins, Woolfolk
and Davis entitled “A Game Law that
Would be Worth While.” I do not
know these gentlemen or their occu
pation, but judging from their article
they must be sportsmen, at least not
farmers. I have said, 'and still stick
to it, that Georgia is practically with
out a game law for the protection ot
game and will be, just as long as the
sporting fraternity of the State sug
gest, and the Legislature enact laws
to meet their hearty approval. The
sportsmen from the large cities usual
ly keep in close communication with
the local sportsman of the little rail
road towns, who does nothing but fish
in fishing season and hunt in hunting
season, while his wife and children
make the living; who keeps them
posted as to the bird crop* and the
amount-of land posted; so on the first
of November of each year they land
at the different railroad towns
throughout the State of Georgia, pro
cure some trifling negro to pilot them
through the corn and cotton fields of
the busy farmers, shooting their birds
down from over their heads while they
toil on, and it is not right. We
farmers caution our tenants and our
boys not to rob the quails’ nests, so
that they may raise more and more
each year. Protecting the nest is
worthless, posting your land is worth
less. The more birds you raise the
more trouble you have with the bird
hunters. If you post your land, some
one will slip in unbeknowing to you,
tear down your notices and shoot your
birds and claim that he did not know
your land was posted. On 450 acres
of my premises I noticed last fall five
nice covies of quails, and since Jan
uary Ist of this year I have not seen
more than three or four single birds.
After the farmers have protected the
quails’ and doves’ nests and raised a
fine crop of them, expecting to trap
or shoot some of them in the fall for
their own consumption, do you think
it is fair to allow the sportsmen from
the. cities and towns to come out on
Ihe first day of the hunting season,
before the birds are grown and before
tlie farmers, who have fed and cared
for them during tie brooding season
have a chance, and shoot them down in
their yards, pastures or fields under a
license? When the young Americans,
both black and white, see the city and
tow’n’s people come out in great
droves, with imported setters and
pointers and brand new guns that glis
ten in the November sunshine like so
many mirrors, taking their birds down
at every crack of the gun —the birds
they had watched from the time they
hatched until they were grown, and
had thrown corn and peas and bread
around the briar patch to keep them
from leaving until papa would give
them time to build them a trap to
catch some of them for their own use
or shoot some of them for a bird pie
or sell in the market to buy candy,
creates a burning indignation in them
not only to destroy the nest, but to
kill and slaughter every living bird,
the blue bird and blue jay not ex
cepted. The farmers would protect
