Elsewhere we print part of an
editorial from the Picayvune writ i
ten by that lpaper in answer to a
query from Hlon. B. W. Bailey of "
WinilfieM,l La.
The,Plicayune has betn a gold
bug paper all along andt thinks it
is yet. It has never let an oppor- I
tunity pass without from onet to
two articles written with the sole
pIrlome of mystifying and misrep
resenting the money question.
A mnau with no other source of
information save that of the Picay
une for the last six months, would
find himself so densely ignorant on
the money question that he could
not tell whether it (moaey) was an
article of diet, an ornament of so)
r ciety, a factor in politics or the
mainspring ofHearven.
Mr. Bailey, however, caught the
clumsy old lady napping, and with
a snarl she blurted out, "We don't
have to answer your question," or
words to that efect. Thben, as she
rubbed her eyes in a dreamy sort t
of way, she admitted the truth for q
the first time in a year, by agreeing
that ifgold was not used as money
by any great nation it would sina
in value to almost nothing.
It is very unfortunate for the
Pie. that she admitted this fact, b
for it follows that the great "in- e
trinsic" value ofgeld so much dot I
ed on by its worshippers, is only
klw-made after all, and our god
(gukl) would be almost worthless if b
we were to take away from it the b
despised "fiat" of governments.
By the Pic's own admission then,
gold is only a base metal like sl- ti
ver, and both placed on an equality o0
(with cotton, wheat, corn, et) be- t
fore the law would be on a perfect 01
"parity" not only with each other G
but with those coarser articles otf
common necessity, cotton, wheat
etc., with the advantages decided- ei
ly in favor of the latter. '
Then, dear Pic, "what fools we I
mortals be" to create a god of gold
confer upon it by statute all the
powers it possesses and then tax
ourselves with untold millions of
debt to get it.
If there was enough gold in the
workld to do the business thereof,
its use as money would not appear
so foolish, blt there is not enough
of the yellow stuff in the whole
workld to do the business of New
York city, and to crowd the values
of the whole world's property into ti
that little lump ot gold by legisla- bi
tion, simply enables a few achem
era to corner said gold and price the a
property and the labor of the rest st
of mankind and take it at said in
price. vi

Candidate "Joe" Sibley.
a Some Cha.racteristics of the New
S iiver Party's Leader.
He Is a Millionaire Banker-Was
Elected to Congress by Comnbi

and Prohilitionists-Is a Stock
Breeder and Successful Business
Man-Has a Fine Address and I
Makes Friends Easily-Is a
Large Owner of Mining Stock.
Special to the Indianapolis News.
Washington, D. C., March 1L.- I
Ex-Congressmaln "Joe" Sibley, otf
Pennsylvania, the presidential can- a
didate of the free silver party, who
was nominated rather informally,
to say the least, last week, by the I
so.called bimetallic league, has
given up hissumptuous apartments
at the Shoreham, f. r which he paid
t $5,000 a year, and gone home.
Mr. Sibley enjoys his new dis
tinction, for he is foml of adver
tising. He was one of the many
queer products of an "off yeas"
election. He is a millionaire batik.
er, who was elected to congress
from a republican district as a fu
sion candidate of the democrats,
People's party and prohibitiqgists
by 3,300 plurality. He did not
even reside ini the district from
which he was elected. Sibley has
had a varied business career. His
money was made from Pennsylva
fnia oil wells, but he has been a
banker and sseeessfnl breeder of
trotting horses. He is a member
of the national association ot trot- c
ting horse breeders. lie says he t
once failed in business in Chicago, c
thus verifying his "cheerful habit I
of failing where otih r men sue.nc
ceeded and succeeding where other (
men failed." c
Mr. Sibley has given away his t
eatire congressional salary for the f
past two years to the agricultural f
societies in his district, of which
he is a member. The new presi- .
dential candidate has an attrac
rive personality that makes him
friends wherever he goes. He is a
few days past forty.-tive. and if he
realizes his ambition and becomes
president two years hence lie will
be the same age Mr. Cleveland was
when inaugnr at d the flrat time. I
Sibley, like other moving spirits
in the bimetallic league, has am in- e
terest, either sallaied or proprie- t
tary, in compelling Uncle Sam to I
buy all the silver produced in the c
mines. His interest is proprietary e
as he is a large owner of mining C
stock, like his republican colleague
in the silver cause from Pennsyl
vania, Senator Cameron. It is d
characteristic of the leaders of the t
"bimetallic league," so called, that a
they are either owners or on a sal- I
ary. It is currently reported that >
A. J. Warne , draws a salary of a
6,000. A. Wolcott, of Indiana, I
one of the signers of the recent free a
silver pronumniamento, is also said
to be a large owner of silver min- t
ing stock.

' The cit i;-rn- of :fWard 9 have
struck a Jrnling question in that
of raising taxation to Ibil, a n-w
conrthotl e.
It is rumllrel that the pari.h
rate of taxation will be raised next
- year to the constitutional limit of
10 mills, and that assessments will
also be raised, which will have the
effect of increasing the taxes of the
people to something more than at
present.
When it is known that over one
third of all taxes in this parish
t were unpaid on the 1st day of Jan
nary, when they became delinquent
and in all probability cotton will
sell another season for 31 cents in
stead of 41, making it that much
harder for the people to get money
it will be seen how utterly impos
sible it will be for people to pay
increased taxes.
But if they sit idly by and al
low their police jury to make con
tracts and pass ordinances, it will
be too late to kick, and they (the
people) will be compelled to raise
the cash or give up their homes.
Now we are not inclined to be
extremists, neither are the people
who have as yet spoken on this
question.
We think the present courthouse
is in a dangerous condition, and
that at least a good deal of retlr.ir
ing will have to be done.
r But we feel sure that two new
walls and a new roof could be put
on to the present house for lees
than half what a new one would
cost, and that then the courthouse
would be almost as good as new.
This would save the vault in the
Clerk's office, which was only re
cently put in at a cost of 5 or 6
thousand dollars, and many other
fixtures on which a lot of money
has been spent.
The last payment on the present
house was made onrly this winter,
and it does seem like bad manage
ment to tear it down now, sink the
parish again in debt, and increase
the taxes of an already overbur
dened people.
The money neccessary to com
pletely repair the present court
house; could be raised by a little
economy and close management in
the parish finances as follows: Our
present rate of parish taxation is 9
mills, 2 of which go to the public
schools leaving 7 for other purpos
es. This on an assessment of a
little over 3 millions (the present
amount) would give 21 thousand
dollars, to which add at least 3
thousand dollars for mercantile
and professional licenses, and you
have 24 thousand. Now if we re
member correctly, the annual bud
get of expenses calls for $18,500
for all purpoes, wrichb might poe
sibly be lowered, as all old judg-1
ments have been caneelled and in
terest stopped, but if it s not low
ered, we see, after taking of the
entire budget, a surplus of $5,500
for one yeat, which would do no
little repairing itself in these days
of cheap labor and material and
dear money, and two yearn sur
plus would be more than suficient
to repair, paint and plaster the
"whole thing."
Why it would be cheaper cn the
taxpayers to go on paying $40 per
month for the rent of the Schaman
hotel, as-they are doing now, than
to either have their taxes raied or
put the parish in debt again and
I pay some "2-bit" bank or Shylock

If Gold Were Demon,til.
Thie I'icayun has rt.cteive-d the
following:
WVI\NNFIEE-, lA., 31a11-h 19, '95.
1Editolr Picaynne, New Orleanis, 1,a.: (
Dear Sir-Not for the Ipurlpoe of
precipitating a nfwspaper contro
versy, but solely for the lpurpose
of gaining information, I would
like to ask you one question. It
is this: t
" Please tell us what effect the
demonetization of gohl would have
upon the price ot the yellow metal,
when coimpared with silver, stand- r
ing in the same category t
Would such action by congress .
have a tendency to equalize the u
value of the two metals, or wonuh!d
the wide range of difference now
existing still be maintained I Very C
truly yours, t
B. W. BAILEY. c
The Picayune, not being engaged
in any sort of prophecy business, t
is unable to say what would hap
pen if such an unexpe ted event as
the demonetization of gold were ii
accomplished. Never since gold
was adopted by the commercial na
tions as a money metal has it been
retired from that condition, and, t
therefore, no precedent exists upon _
which to base suppositions on the
subject, and, as to mere idle specu
lattom on the subject, the field is
open to all comers.
It may well be supposed tbat, if
gold were demonetized and coinage
in it refused by all the great com
mercial nations, the yellow metal
would sink to the position of an
article of commerce, and its com
mercial value would be regulated
by such demand as there might be
for it. Further than this it would
be profitless to speculate about it.
But it gold were demonetized by
the Congress of the United States,
and retained as money by all the
other great nations, and that is
the proposition advanced by the
correspondent, the probabilities are
that the eflect would be very dif
ferent from wbhat it would be if all
the nations should reject it. " "
