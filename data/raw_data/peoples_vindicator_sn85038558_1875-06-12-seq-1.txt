One by one the measures of relief
enacted by the extra session are be
ing killed off by the radical State ad
nhinistration and its juliciary.., Mr.
Kellogg, in violation iof his mnst sol
elmn pledge, vetoed the House bill for
the rehlief of the tax-payers, indil now,
rn we have the supplemental Funditlg
Bill, which was designed to subject
several mnilliolns ofaluestionalde bondis
to the test of a judicial exa:mination
-before their funding, and to make the
president of the New Orleans Cihain
her of Commnerce a mnember of the
Funding Board, declared uneonstitu
tional, pull and void by the Superior
District Court, lrhresideld over by that
pink of rascals, hlawkins. Whatever
force there may he in the views of the
Court given ini the extract below, it is
deeply Ito be igl'ett.cd thliat Mr. John
Phelps, Pr'sident of thle (Chi., ;:'r of
Comnmerce, is by the decision exclud
ed from the funding board. A mian
of flte praetical sense, large experi
.. ence and sterling integrity, the pco
plie looked to himi to see that no fur
ther frauds were perpetrated by the
board in funding the State bonds.
'The court said, in determining against
the constitutionality of the act
The appaling feature 'in this neact ij~s
o fond in section three, which abso
W lately prohibits the funding commiis
siºn from acting until the courts
should determine whether certain
bonds or contracts which they desig-.
m- nate as questioned should be valid or
t riot. T.he Legislature has no power
it antnhority to raise a question as to
in the validity or corroctness of a con
tract after the contriact is nmade, and
a declaration to that effect is there
- fore idle and nugiitory. 'rho ques
i. tiob is a purely jiudicial qnestion.
The LPgislatnre is without the right
or autlhority to e'nact the decree.
Having done aso in this case, and for
the iipurpose of enabling themi to do
so, having provided parties who have
no interest in the chilS, the whole

Th1 Conspiracy to Mako Grant
ef Pay Fare.
- tf the iroceeding whelreby, the
SP'resident 'f the United States was
" eonipelled to pay his railroaid fare like
an humble:citizen, the Kiingtou (New
r oik) Freeinan says:
c, Mr. Gooilwin's action is probablyl,
c.r par'te ant results from an innate
Ct tlis osiioe:e to make mis'hief ratih Ir
s tha from niobie tlesire to promin:te
'n the' end of justice. Th'le President
, and his ,nite are suddenly thrown
" linpo their owni res1ourc.es in resplect
e of getting over the New York and
' New HIaveni while on a lpi,.us and
1r patriotic pilgrimage to Conlcord to
't attend the centeinial celebratio, of
'r thel revolutionary skirmish there.
e Th1 hiahtus in this case is (deiploralhl
iani mortify ing. General Geniat, with
1 his entire natural and milital y iouse
hold, arrived at tl;e FJ'th A:'e:,ue
hotel on Thursday evening on the
n way to the!old Granite State. They
expected free translportation, ias theci
hlofty position hiefoire the country jus
tifies thele in doing. And the rail
e roads-thei' ewYork and New Haven
among tile rest-were willing and
anxions to accord this courtesy. All
was well nUltil the party got to the
Snetropolis., There they ran squari'e
and smack alp against Goodwin's in
julinctionl. Like a Iregimelelit of crip
pled veterans running against, let us
say, the ClIiniese wall, there was ino
getting ardund this injmectiom uor
r ovel it. There was only one way to
ldodge the injunction, and the party
was put up to it by a telegram from
George Wiinihington Chills, A. M., of
Philadelphia, who had been inftilrml
ed tf the troulble. The brief and
lbrilliant dispaltch is said to have been
tcouched in the following terms:
P'IIILADiELPrIIA, April 15, 1875.
* To r. S. Grant etc.:
Injunction don't apply to you. Yon are not a
"ser ant of the Uuid State," but its Imaster.
Ha ! a !h.

Babcock seized the telegram and
rushed to Forty-second street to tind I
MIr. Bishop, President of the New
York and New Haven Railroad. Ile
ran Ibreathless into Bishop's office and
shouted : "We've got the bulge on
Goodwin-we've euchred the Yankee
Judge; see here-see how Childs
puts it; and Childs is ai stateman as
well as the greatest epitaphist in the
world." "Twon't do, Babcock," an
swered Mr. Bishop; "you recollect,
perhaps, how the elections are going.
The people won't stand it. You'll
have to pay your fare or stay away.
Sorry. The whole thing's mneaneIr'n
pnsley, but it can't be helped. You
can borrow the ioney of Gould and
make it all rightisvith himn when lie
wants anythingiln Washington." The
battle-scarred factotum went .back to
the hotel anid reported to his chief.
Geieral Grant listened with fiid cns
ternary intellectual ailertness, and for
the first time in hiss life betrayed p.al
lmomentary selrprise, which Ihe al
lowed to express itself in a senten- i
tions phrase. Blowing from hlis lips
at cloud of smoke' from ia fifty cent
regalia, he said, this is all a dream,.
Babcock."
But it does not point ont why the '

lnstrates his modesty, as wh. en he
told his taylorl il Richm.on that his

than he was ; and another, showing a
his common sense and good taste,.

as tlhest. Phlating is the net point
t:o conusider. The griand should be
plowed a),1d phma1ted inminediately, not
giving the wreils and gra-s a chance
to get a week the start, but start all
out together, and the seeds will
spr)'llt out quicker tthan the weeds.
The best timne to plant Is medium
corn plainting: plant in drills three
feet apart, puttinig the seed about
three inches a part, as near as yol
can get them without measuring; as
5soo)l as the seed are all up, roll and
harrow : thlen cultivate same as corn.
Breakitln is next in order. This is
done when the btulshl is ready to cut.
'hisi is ii backward business, com
mencing at the end of two rows, faec
in g the end; breaking the first Ihatd
f+il down across in front of yrnO-
ward the other row, and the lther
row across the first, in the .shape of
an X.. To do this, break thbe,first
about two and one-half feet high
ac'ross your arm-the tops of ono row
reaching across theother. Do not
break lore, than 'you can cut, tle
same day ; commence cutting as soon .
as there is milk in the seed. Cutting
is done witl a short shoe knife. Cut
aboutt the last joint, say fromn four to
six inches below the birush ; cunteach
stock separate; cut down and push
your knife fiout you and the boot will
slip off if you catch above in the bush
and cut above the joint. Cut a handb
fiul, lay it uppu lthe table straight, apd
haul in tihe shame day. Taike the seed
off. You can do this on an dild thresh
ing cylinlder by turning the spikes
anld r'unning it backwards, holding
the brush on by. the handsfltl. _t
careful in keeping it straight all thie
time, and every tunime you hatf1uJt,
then place it in the shed to dry. To
do this, nail poles ocr strips to posts,
placing themli about six inchlles aparti
and put your lath u tpoih the otto '
strip-across to the one on the othg
side' lay two laths, then a layer of
brusli about four inches thick, then a
lath o;n the next strips and 'so on as
far up as you can reanh. After it is
perfectly dry, take domn and tie in
bhundles. With the crjenked make the
baans. It will dry in abount three
weeks if it has plehtv or veuntlation.
