OU Indian!” affection
ately exclaimed Wills,
looking up into the face
of his old comrade, his
eyes incandescents of
friendship.
“No,” Beam laughed
back, “six years in the
wilds of Alaska may have
I 1
I . J ’
made me a savage, but not an Indian
—not even a squaw man.”
Burton Wills 'had always held Jack
Beaim in a sort of adorationI—the 1 —the kind
which a sensitive, quiet man of in
stinctive refinement sometimes feels
for a big, rollicking huskie of a fel
low who overtops him in every phy
sical way. And so Wills stood, his
delicate white hands trying to span
the knot of iron muscles which bulged
each of Beam’s sleeves, and looked
up into the blue eyes of his strapping
'boyish friend who had been lost to
him for six years —ever since they
had left col’ege.
“Will,” returned Beam, “if you ab
solutely insist upon grub with white
woman trimmings, I yield. I’m as
hollow as an elbow of rusty stovepipe.
Can’t get my fill-up of food that
doesn’t grow in cans! It’s longer
between meals here than it was be
tween seasons to me up there. After
I get my internal excavation partially
filled, I’ll tell you all about it, odd
man! ’ ’
They sought the most secluded ta
ble for two in the Dutch room of the
Annex and Wills ordered a feast,
Which he knew would warm Jack’s
memory of certain nights in their
college days when they had lived the
greedy, luxuriant life of youth. Not
a good thing which had appealed to
Jack’s taste ’had escaped the recol
lections of Wills; and as he named
one item after another to the waiter
Beam exclaimed:
“Lord, man! —but that does listen
right to a fellow from the wild North!
And you look awful good to me, too.
And these little candles in their red
night caps, these colored windows,
these white cloths, this polished sil
ver —everything I can put my eye on
looks good. I’ve got out —back into
God’s country where things are a lit
tle further from the Stone Age. And
tomorrow night I’m going to have you
pour me into a dress suit, after which
I’m going to file on the best prospect
there is in the world!”
“Sure that claim hasn’t been
taken?”
“No, but I made it my first busi
ness, after I struck civilization, to
find out that there was nothing on
record to that effect.”
When the coffee and cigars were
reached, Beam grew silent for some
time and then remarked:
“Old man, you don’t know a thing
about how easy it is for even a de
cent and self-respecting man to slip
back into savagery when he lives
away from woman-kind. You fel
lows, down here, who mix with live
girls and good women every day of
your lives haven It the remotest no
tion of the brutalizing blank it leaves
in a man’s life when the faces of wo
men are removed from it —month
after month! Just try to imagine
AN NIT. THE AMIABLE: ALASKAN OUTCAST
By Beach-
what it would be to see nothing but
men and dogs for a whole year.”
“Yes,” responded Wills, thought
fully, “I went to see ‘The Squaw
Man’ played the other night, and I
think I can understand how it is that
men who are shut away from real
women, year after year, revert to the
primitive and take Indian wives who
are leagues beneath them.”
“But there’s one thing which no
play, no story can make quite real to
any man who’s not been through it:
The feeling that any human being in
the shape of woman who has any
claim to a full set of true woman
instincts is good, is better than a
uthole camp of men.”
“But think of a white man —one
who has beeen a man among men in
a civilized country —taking an ignor
ant savage woman as his wife. It’s
sii mply abhor re nt! ”
“Yes,” dreamily responded Jack
Beam, leaning against the back of the
heavy oak chair and letting the smoke
curl in a slender, vagrant spiral from
his lips, while a far-away look crept
into his eyes —“so it is—especially
if you happen to have carried into
the north country the picture of some
particular girl, -that you hoped to find
free when you’d made your pile and
returned to civilization; that’s the
way it was w'th me. And, still, I
have reason to know that even a
squaw is capable of a devotion that
the whole world of women can w’ell
afford to be proud of as something
fine which belongs to woman-kind
alone. ”
“Yes,” suggested Wills.
“Alaska isn’t any Sunday school,
and I’ve never heard it accused of
being overcapitalized on the score of
morals. Perhaps it’s really about as
moral as any other place; but, be
cause it’s run wide open and no
false fronts, things look decidedly
different up there to the man who’s
had his moral eyesight adjusted ac
cording to the polite standards of
society in the States. It took me
sometime to get used to the new
line-up.
“Partnership comes nearer to mai
riage in Alaska than anywhere else
in the world. You live witlh your
partner there, and every characteristic
he has comes out in the relationship.
Ability to cook and to keep the shack
in ship-shape counts in a partner al
most as much as it does in a wife. If
you draw a fool or a coward or a
bungler there in the wild north, it
may cost you your life. Up there you
pick a partner on different lines than
here in the States; if you can hook
up with a man who knows more about
the country than you, one who can
get you out of a tight place alive in
which, perhaps, you would otherwise
lose your head and your life, then he
is a good partner and you don’t stop
to figure whether yon and he admire
the same style of beauty, read the
same books, like the same music or
belong to the same fraternity. His
ability to match his wits and his
strength against the crude forces and
conditions of Nature —against cold
and heat, and ice and rapids,
and fatigue and discouragement and
Jeffersonian
disease —and win Where another would
lose, makes him a prize as a partner
and you learn to put up with a good
deal that isn’t exactly congenial in
the nicer sense.
“Well, for these reasons, partnei
ships formed in the States between
tenderfeet sometimes get frostbitten
in the first winter ‘inside’- —they fail
to work out according to plan. Any
how, the little bunch of us fellows
from the East split up and I made up
my mind that my next partner would
be a man of the country, somebody
who had been seasoned out of dooi , s
in Alaska,.
“I thought I found the right part
nership timber in the shape of an old
timer who certainly’knew the country
clear down below the frost-line. Al
most immediately after we had hitched
up together, Bill met me one day, on
returning from town, and seemed
.pleased with himself. I asked Him
the cause of his optimism—or at least
of that part of it which was not pub
lished on his breath —and he came
hack at me with :
“ ‘Got something new, pardiner.’
“ ‘You look as if it might be a dog
or a pair of red-top boots,’ I replied.
“ ‘Nope —squaiw,’ was his answer.
“'Then I told him that I didn’t
consider him as a brother, and that
I wasn’t his keeper and that if he
wanted a squaw drudge he could have
one —but that she couldn’t live in our
cabin, and that his cooking and my
own suited me a whole lot better than
that of any dirty Indian I had ever
seen. So it was agreed that his Min
nie-ha-ha should have a separate
cabin and one was prepared for her.
“Old man, I wish you could have
seen her —I named here Annie the
Amiable, the first day of her appear
ance. She was just a kid—probably
not more than sixteen or seventeen —
and the most comical little creature
you ever looked at. Her eyes were
black as jet, but bright and keen.
From the first, here intent to please
was as clear as the stars. She slaved
and drudged for Bill, and he took it
all as complacently as an Indian.
“One day, however, when I came
back from doing some assessment
work, I found him exhausting the
Alaskan vocabulary and beating her
with a gad which an old-fashioned
New England school teacher would
have been ashamed to have used. In
a second I was seeing red and, being
some husky, Bill was inclined to lis
ten when I suggested tliat if he didn’t
quit I’d turn in and beat him into
the ground He stopped—but mut
tered tliat she was a squaw and he
guessed that he could treat her any
way he liked.
“Then I got warmed up to the
work and proved to him that he was
some considerable mistaken.; that I
didn’t enjoy the near society of dusky
maidens anyhow, but that I had been
willing to waive my own likes and
dislikes on the ground that a partner
had a right to folow his own social
impulses; but that when it came to
standing quietly by and seeing a hulk
ing brute of a> man beat any woman —
copper colored or lily-white—as he
would a sulky sledge dog, that was
stretching toleration beyond my limit.
“Bill was sour and surly over my
armed interference for a number of
days; but in less than ten minutes
after the beating, Annie was singing:
“ ‘Somebody, Somebody—
He come to see me.’
,‘‘ All through the long winter Anhie
drudged and worked for Bill —an ir
repressible spring of good nature.
Her very amiability, however, seemed
to stir up all the devils within this
choice partner of mine. There was a
surly, cruel streak in him which
seemed to demand something to brow
beat. He couldn’t indulge that spe
cies of pleasure with me, so he took
it all out on Annie, the poor little
'helpless outcast of a despised race,
who had fallen into his 'hands in the
same way a stray dog might have
come into his possession. While I
was around he knew better than to
carry this pastime beyond the point
of mere quarreling and verbal abuse,
but it was occasionally evident that
he made up for his restraint when I
happened to be away for a day or
two.
“In the meantime, I began to learn
almost as much about my selected
partner as he knew about the coun
try. From one source and another, I
drew nuggets of information which
made it plain I had hitched up with
one of the real bad men of the coun
try —a mutineer from Herschel Island
Who 'had a record that would shame
Beelzebub. Bill was wanted for mur
der, arson and about all the high
crimes and misdemeanors which are
abhorred by civilization and punished
with sudden death in the mining
camps.
“While I was gradually getting
this information together I drew from
patient, laughing, singing litle Annie
the only flash of temper that ever
came from her in all my partnership
with Bill, the Squaw Man. It cer
tainly was one of the surprises of my
life.
“On a little shelf, over my bunk
in the corner of the cabin in which
Bill! and I lived, I kept my personal
household possessions; a revolver, a
quantity of cartridges, a field glass,
some patent trouser buttons and two
large safety pins for fastening blan
kets. One of the pins 'had disap
peared, and when Annie the Amiable
came from her cabin, to slick up in
our shack, I asked her if she had seen
anything of it.
“Now, a 4-inch safety pin isn’t
much down here in the Statesr-but
up in horseless Alaska it’s different.
I he possession of those two pins made
me an envied man. They couldn’t be
replaced not in the whole country —
and my six-shooter was an inonse
quential trifle compared with- a pin
that would go through two thickness
of blanket and bold like an anchor.
So the thought that I had, perhaps,
lost one of my priceless pins stirred
me up out of all proportion to the
seeming insignificance of the matter.
I took everything out of the bunk,
searched every square inch of the
floor and turned the shack upside
down and inside out. Finally it qc-
