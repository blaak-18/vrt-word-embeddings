With no exeuso but, the request
of the cowardly Usurper, Kellogg,
and no right bat the on." of power,
the military forces of the United

position of .Speaker, and will probably

tion. Kellojï;; hopes to eanso a defection
from the Coiiaervntive side hy putting up,
us before Htated, Kx-Uovernor JIalin, of Ht.
.lames, for .Speaker,
At l i o'clock Mr. Foster and Mr. Phelps,
of the Ctmgmwion.'il Committee, ('aptain
Vance, of the Cincinnati Commercial, Mr.
Kirkliiim anil Mr. Orilway, entered the
House und (ook seats near the platform.
Win, Vipers, Clerk of the late House,
then called the House to order and pro
ceeded to call the roll wf the members.—
When the clerk came to Kapidcg Parish
Mr. .leü'ries pive notice of contest, chain
ing that the members present did not at
all represent the popular will, as ex preen
ed at the la it, election.
Tiio names of Marie and Wright, of Ter -
re hon ne, were also formerly protested
api'mst.
The call of the roll revealed 102 mem
bers present. 1,. A. Wiltz, was then pro
posed for Speaker, and the motion at one-;
carried. Judce Houston thou administer
ed the oath.
Mr. Flood was then elected Sergeant-at
A iiim pro ti-m. Geo, Trezavant was also
elected ( ,'lerk pro tem.
A motion was the,ii made to administer
the oath to nil members declared elected.
The Speaker put the motion and it was
carried.
'I iiis raised a violent commotion nmonjf
the Radicals, and some of them called up
on their colleagues to leave the building.
< »l iier was maintained and the Speaker
proceeded to administer the oath to all
present.
- We take up our report of the military
interfere nee in the Legislature, at the mo
ment when General Trobriand demanded
of Sjwaker Will/ that, the members not re
turned bv the Returning Hoard be ejected.
To this Mr. Wiltz objected and refused to
allow any member to be ejected unless a
•icsort was had to força by the United
States foie -s. He said ne owed it to his
people acil it was his duty ho to act.—
General Trobrian then ordered Viggrs to
proceed with the calling of the roll, which
he proceeded to do, the Conservative
members refusing in almost every in
stance to answer to their names, and refu
sing in any manner to recognize Vigers
The roll however was continued, and
clerk lepoited tiiat 5*1 had answered the
call. Mr. Lowell said he was a member
elect, am! diu not desire to be seated by
force of arms, but wanted to act legally
and under tiie'constitution of the State.
Speaker Wiltz said ho was the legal Spea
ker and that officers now installed wore
the legal officers, and ho protested against
the calling of r !i-< roll.
General Trobriand then retired to the
door, and a tile of soldiers at his bidding,
soon afterwards entered the hall. General
Trobriand then walked up the aide anil
asked that the clerk, Vigers, should call
the roll.
Speaker Wiltz protested against tbe en
trance of the military and requested the
members to join in a protest with him.
r i response to this call all of the Const
v ,
profus
H»
members stood up and solemnly
lid continuing tli.if, as the matter
stood tiiev were at. th« mercy of General
Trobriand and tho bayonets of his troops.
Tiic soldiers of the tfnited States are with
bayonets in the Hall of iJepresentatives of
!.oui-.iana, and he again solemnly entered
his protest, against the nil warrant ed in
trusion.
Vigers, at this juncture, attempted to
act-as clerk. Mr. Trezavant objected as
did .Speaker Wiltz.
Vigers then retired to get a special de
tail to install him, and at this point the
chairman of the Committee on Credentials
r -ported the following contestants as ent i
tle;! to their seats, viz: Dunn of Grant,
Jeliries, Ijiiekeft and Stafford of Rapides,
Vaughn, lloran and Land of Caddo, Swing
of Iberia, (^iiinn of Avoyelles.
V igers was soon buck again, accompa
nied by soldiers and General Trobriand,
who had in the meantime gone out also,
and with them Major General flugn .1,
Campbell, of the Louisiana militia. Gen
fj, H
oral Campbell asked Speaker Wiltz to
point out tho members just admitted upon
tho report, of tho Committee on creden-1
liais. Mr. Wiltz refused to comply with
the demand, and again entered Iiis protest
against military intrusion.
General 1'robriand replied that; he cmld
not, decide upon contested places, and
must obey his order. He, accompanied by,
Cencral Campbell, then went around with
a file of soldiers with fixed bayonets pro
ceeded to eject Mr. Vaughn of Caddo,
Messrs. Stafford, Jeffries and Luckett, of,
l.'apidcs, Mr. Dunn, of Grant, Mr. Kelly, of;
\\ inn, and Messrs. Horan and Laud, of
Caddo, who each and all protested in the
name of tfu^ieoplu whom they specially
represented, and iu the name of the people
of t-ho whole Union, against this force
of arms.
Gen. Campbell then asked that. Vigers
call the roll, so that all not upon might be
ejected by the troops.
Against this action Mr. Wiltz firmly pro
tested, but Gen. Trobriand ordered Vigers
to proceed.
Mr. Vigers again attempting to call the
roll, the Speaker called upon th
r V K ' pi )l ' : ! K, ' r »po« t"«'Sergeant
at-Arni" to eject linn. Capt. Hood then
went on the platform and laid his hand on
»'V's»;« ami ejected him from
lui' p «ii ioi îïî.
(fen. Campbell then appealed to Gen.
Trobriand to protect Vigers, whereupon
the speaker asked Gen. Campbell by what
.authority lie was acting 111 the House, as
lie did not recognize hiui as a.member. To
! j iis ' Campbell replied that he reganl
the legislature assembled as a rcvoluiioii
!ary body; that he was appointed command
er of the state House liy Gov. Kellogg, and
on • Ji.'it autiionty lie proposed to act.
Tho Speaker then called on the Sorwant
jat-Arms to eject Campbell, when Captain

then appealed for protec
Trobriand asked tin
atrnj unmsa
Speaker if it would be necessary to use
force, to which lie was answered in the
affirmative.
Gen. Trobriand tlien gave a signal and
two officers, followed by two soldiers with
guns and bayonet attachments, entered
and marchcd up to the platform.
Then tho Speaker, rising in Iiis seat,
said
"As the lepal Speaker of tho FTnuie of
Representative» of the State of Louisiana
I have protested against, the invasion of
our hall by the soldiers of the United
States with drawn bayonets and loaded
muskets. We have seen our brother mem
bers violently seized by force of arms and
torn from us iu spite of their solemn pro
test. We have seen a force of soldiers
marfJi up tho aisles of tho Hall of Rcpro
üentatives of Louisiana, have protested
against this in tberiame of a once free peo
ple. In the name of the once free State of
Louisiana, in tho name of tho Union, ho
optered Iiis solemu protest.
Tho chair of the only Speaker of the
House of Louisiana is surrounded by Uni
ted States troops, tho officers of the House
are prisoners in their hands, so I solemnly
declare that Louisiana has ceased to lie a
sovereign stute; that it has no longer a re
publican government, and I call on the
Rcpuesentativo* of the State to retire with
mo before this show of arms."
SPEAKEK WILTZ,
with all the Conservative members then
left tho Hall in a bodv, and inarched to
the. Conservative IleaiVpiarters, No. 71 St,
Louis street., where they soon after ad
journed to meet again at 7\ o'clock this
evening. .
They were followed T»y an immense con
course of citizens, who cheered tliein ter
rifically ami called for speeches.
Mr. Marr and other gentlemen then ad
dressed the crowd in a few words, enjoin
ing them to keep tho pence. Tho crowd
thereupon drew off, hut. returned, however
to tho vicinity of the State House, where
large numbers of citizens had gathered to
watch and hear what was going on.
TUB RADICAL I,KUI8I.ATt:KK"
After the withdrawal of the Conserva
tives, (,'lerk Vigers proceeded to call the
roll, when ,">'1 members answered to their
names. Fiffy-fonr was necessary to a
quorum; but the H oiiko surmounted this
difficulty by Vigers declaring .there were
liffy-four present, which was a remarkable
deviation from strict facts.
It was tfieri moved and carried that
Halm lie elected permanent. Speaker.—
Hahn on taking his seat, delivered the
usual stereotyped aildnss of thanks.
Lowell then took the floor and made the
remarkable assertion that ho protested
against the presence of United States mil
itary iu the hall of the Hoi^g, and moved
that, they be required to leave.
Mnrrill suggested that the Serjeant-at
Arms exclude them, but the military ob
viat.eil tho difficulty by voluntarily reti
ring.
Oil motion, then, the Speak'-r proceeded
to «wear in the members, he himself hav
ing been sworn in by Mr. Lowell, "the
oldest, member," v.-hen that gentleman's
scruples were removed by the retirement
of the U. S. Military.
On motion, Tyler and Johnson of Tie
Soto, and Ward from Grant, were admit
ted to seats, the House reserving tho right
of contest.
(If the members from the other two par
is.'ies had been ' present, they would also
have been admitted.)
A message was then received from the
Senate, that that body was ready to pro
ceed to bii.sine:-.«.
On motion it was agreed that th" House
be governed by the same rules as obtained
in 1S7Ü.
Vigors was then elected Chief Clerk of
tile Houae, and Koxboro, Assistant Clerk.
Committees were then appointed to
wait on the Senate and Governor and in
form them that the Hou.'ie was organized
and ready to proceed to business.
A committee of nin-cn on elections and
qualifications v/as also appointed.
K. C. Howard was then elected Post
master.
A message was next received from the
Governor, which, on being read, was laid
over to fie called 117».
Again Mr. Lowell moved that a commit

Mr. Editor :
In the very midst of the holidays
thongh we are, still all is lif« and
bustle witb the activity of business.
The old year that is slowly dying
ot servility, wdt leave behind it a
thriving and prosperous city. The
future of Houston looms up gigan
tically. Commodore Charles Moi*
gun, worth somswhsiein thoaeig**
bor hood of $20,000,000, not only
has bought several hundred thou
sand dollars worth of oar rätst«
Bonds. Not only is ooostijialSig |[
ship channel from the sea to tbe
corporate limits of this ctty tflMt
will allow ocean steamers to
to our wharves, bat be has

City Boudsand is now one of the
city's creditors to tbe amoun t a T-«
one fourth her debt. A* man wftb
the financial ability, the moricy >
making sense of Charles Morgan,
who makes sach large investi*; oils
as he is making in Texasand Hons*
ton, knows that Iiis money is com«
ing back to bim aud he is going to
spend other money to make Ituihl- }
tiply. These investments of, this,
gentleman are good omens tor,
Houston. The result is an upward
tendency already in Beal Estate
and an increased bonyaney in bàrfi»
ness circles. No better plaotf can'
be found in Texas to invest is
al Estate than in Honstôa. Âa
opening is now offered by Capt. J.
15. Foster, Beal Estate Broker iu
this city, to secure property in I«;,,
as, a vast deal of which isiu Hous
ton, at a nominal sum. He will on
the 3d of March next, give his sç*
coud gold and laud drawing, when
he will distribute among tiokëfr
holders $25,000 iu gold and |lS0 r
000 in Keal Estate. I will give yon
a little politics before a great while;

17 The Washington
makes the following allega
specting President Graut :
" The President amistcd in • privai*
lx)T at Tool»'» perforiuauca last Thursday
night, and the opinion pravailiKl among
tii« disiut»nwf «nl of the vreheatra ehaira
that, judging from appvorancM, b* would
not troubled with th« third term. Hi*
Kxc «M«ucy, we are pained to writ«, la not
in th« beat of health ; and, although pou.
Messing an iron constitution, if not more
careful nfhituaeif Ii« will not 1m about
lunch longor to trouble th« politicians. Of
lute we lt-aru that he ha« boon extremely
careless of nis health."
This means in plain langnage
that tbe President was conspicuous*
ly drunk at tbe theatre», aud has of
late beeu frequently seen in that
condition, and we dare say it is
true. But the idea that his health
is undermiued by such practices is
luistakeu. fie is a man ot extraor*
dinary strength and endurance,
and although he is in danger of be»
coming » continued drunkard again,
us he wits wheu he was obliged to
resign from the army iu Califoruia
in 185-1, there is no probability that
his lite will be seriously abbrevia
ted by that cause. Such is the
quality of his nervous Bystem that
ho er. i. get druuk pretty otten and
como fresher out ot it than auy
other man ; aud so it will probably
be to tbe eud.[— K Y. Sun.
T ue J iüwei .. —We are glad to seo
that this popular house has passed
into tho management of onr worthy
friend, Sam. Eellows who will here
after run it as proprietor, with that
genial gentlemen, Jack Beilley as
assistant. No better or more de«
serving young men are to bo found
anywhere and they will doubtless do
well. Sam has been tbe presiding
genius of the establishment of Hess
and French for tho year past, bnt as
they have closed out he Las started
on his own account at the Jewel.
Success to him I
t^By reference to his advertise
ment in another place it will be
seen that Mr. Julius Goodman, who
has beeu keeping the Pacific Saleou
has taken the place of Messrs 'Hess
& French at the Excelsior Saloon
under the Exchange Hotel, <febere
his numerous friends will find him
plentifully supplied with tbe very
best of the wherewithal to get npa
satisfactory "smile."
li'' At the election on Monday
last, Mr. Edouard Weil was elected
Mayor of Alexandria by a handsome
majority, and Messrs. Moses Rosen
thal, Jos, Bouillotte, E. E. Biossat,
M. Legras and W. W. Whittington
Jr., were elected Councilmen. We
congratulate tbe good people of our
