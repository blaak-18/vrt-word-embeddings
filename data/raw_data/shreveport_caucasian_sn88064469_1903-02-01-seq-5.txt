It Is impossible to keep human na
tare at a tension forever. The snap
must fbllow, and consequently it
should occasion no surprise' that new
apostles have arisen, preaching the gos
pel of good cheer, insisting upon hap
piness as a natural element of being
and merriment as an important part
of its expression, says a writer in the
Boston Cooking School Magazine. Ac
cording to the writer, the new goqpel,
which is being more and more general
ly accepted, means social and family
regeneration. It stands for a more
perfect understanding between indi
viduals, a unity of purpose, a new
sympathy of endeavor and a better
and deeper affection based upon a
clearer knowledge of one another's
traits and characteristics-that is, of
course, where it is taken at its best
and finest. There is another side.
which develops quite the opposite
qualities, and one of the first lessons
which ofle has to learn is that there is
all the difference in the world lbtween
having fun with the members of one's
own family or one's friends and mak
ing fun of them. The one is a delight
in which all share alike; the other is a
cruelty whi-ch causes one ie. son morti
fication and pain, while the others are
hardened ip spirit and coarsened in
mind by the very ability to enjoy the
suffering which they inflict.
The ability to see the humorous side
of a domestic hardship and to smile
when the first impulse is to scold or
cry is one of the most fortunate pos
sessions of a house mother and has
saved the situation for her many and
many ,a time. What threatened to be
tragedy, or at least melodrama, has re
solved itself into pure comedy, and the
recital of it in the new phase in family
conclave has been a source of unalloy
ed mirth when, had it been presented
as it first appeared, it would have cast
a pall over every spirit.
A sense of humor is a saving grace,
and, where one does not possess it as a
natural gift, it should be carefully cul
tivated, and that is by no means impos
sible. If there is one member of the
family who cannot comprehend a joke
or see the point to a story unless a dia
gram accompanies it, by all means fur
nish thie dlagrkm. By and by it will be
no longer needed. Sometimes this un
ap1eative member refuses, to accept
the- mental handicap and makes believe
to ejory all the jokes, because she will

".iTI5OF ALL LENGTHS.
Sease Reach Only to the Knees,
Others Touch the Skirt Hem.
[Special Correspondence.]
New York, Jan. 26.-Just one-half our
wraps are as long as our dresses, while
the others are in all kinds of lengths.
Each has been designed to suit some.
particular taste, and so there is a very
wide choice. The Monte Carlo coats
are still with us. and many of the gar
ments offered for midwinter are in that
shape, while the kimono coat is of
fered for those who like that best.
There is something to be said in favor
of each. After them comes the auto
mobile coat generally lined with squir
rel fur. It has needcto be warm for the
purpose.
The automobile coats are long enough
to reach the knees in any case, and
sometimes longer. Shorter effects are
preferred- for runabouts, and there are
many kinds of these. The least com
fortable ones are cut flaring at the bot
tom, something like the extreme styles
of the men's coats of the past season.
They set out around the bottom some
what stiffly and are stitched several
times to make them do so. A novelty
in the sleeves is that there is but one
seam and that is directly on the top.
and the sleeve itself is the old hell
shape, now quite a fad and called pa
goda.
In the illustration can bhe seen a coat
in this design, and many there be who
think it perfect. The coat is lined with
fur, and there is a stole of pointed
beaver reaching to the bottom after
spreading out wide on the shoulders
like a victorine. A muff to match is
carried with it atnd would lead one to
think that the stole was postiche, but it
isn't. It belongs on the coat.
The longer coat beside it is made of
black twilled silk, heavy and thick, and
is flpished on the outside like cloth,
with stitching. There is a cape some
thing like those on the Monte Carlos,
but yet not exactly the same. This
style of coat is lined with fur, general
ly of the less expensive varieties' and
always close furs. The collar and long
revers are of mink or some other dark
and deep fur. The revers are so made
that they can be thrown back and the
collar left fiat, or they can be buttoned
across the chest and the collar lifted to
the proportions of a stornu collar. By
many this style of coat is preferred to
one with fur outside.
The long ulsters are as fashionable
as they ever have been? and they are
made to reach quite to the bottom of
the skirt. The backs to some are cut
somewhat in the princess style.and in
others straight sack -shape. Again in
others there is a double fold from top
to bottom, ,ypd a few have stitched
yokes. There are also many elegant
coats in. a semlhistorte cut really
dressand picturesque.
Besides all these there are very many
pes in military and other shapes, but
mostly rather long and narrow than
hiand shbort. astaeretofore. The rich.

'i LtGHTS OF PASHIONR
Latest Small Points In the Dress of
Modish Women.
Never were the small accessories of
dress of as much consequence as now
belts, neckwear of all kinds, scarfs,
garnitures for hair and corsage, as well
as countless other small addenda of
the toilet are in the greatest demand.
and materially aid in carrying out de
sired effects.
For years the dainty little collars and
cuffs of lawn were supposed to be the
exclusive prerogative of widows. but
such is the feminine desire for all
things becoming they have now been
adopted for general use and are grow
ing in favor with each season, as noth
ing gives a prettier or more immacu
lately dainty finish. When the fact is
added that they are almost universally
becoming, the only wonder is that they
were not sooner appreciated. In a
simple and inexpensive set the collar
is very deep and opens in front, and
either a stock of some suitable color
or a ribbon tied in a small bow with
ends to the waist may be used with it.
The cuffs are much nariower and the
same pretty work of embroidered vio
lets and hemming is emnployed as on:
the collar.
Among the little points worth know
ing is that many modish women are
now wearing the fiuneSt of wiol or an
gora mittens over their white kid
gloves when walking. Thus a double
purpose is accomplished--the hand
which holds the skirt from the ground
is protected from the cold and the glove
preserved immaculately whlite. The
latter reason alone would never suffice,
for who ever heard of a custom being
received into the good graces of modish
women because of its economy? How
ever, the idea started with those who
love sports and lead an outdoor life
in winter as well as summer, and has
now been adopted by many who have
found its comfort worth consideration.
The very extensive use of wash ma
terials for shirt waists to be worn un
j j I
der fur coats has brought into promt
nence the new stocks of pique or
cheviot much earlier than could have
been.expected.
A new and very smart tmaterial used
for the gay colored and warm waist
coats worn in winter for protection
against the cold when enjoying out of
door sports is a silk made in exceed
ingly heavy cords of contrasting
shades or al in t one color, as pete

able in the hand. The little walat
costs pre beautifully made, bound with
taffeta and finished with large man
nish pearl buttons in a double bteasted
effect. Scarlet is always a bright and
cheerful. shade for such an affair.
White lingerle skirts are fast taking
the place of silk ones on the street
among well dressed women. They
have the attraction of cleanliness
which is so greatly hi their favor,- mi
they rest our eyes from cut and frayed
ruffles, piases and ragged edges in
general, which the modishness. of silk
walking skirts made possible. There
is a new petticoat material, however,
called wash silk, in colors, which is as
light as taffeta and warranted to wear
far better. The fact that it will wash
makes it desirable for street petticoats.
It differs from customary wash silks
for waists.
-Vogue, -from- whichthe f oregoing
items are gleaned, illustrates a recep
tinm, gown- that suggests 'many good
points. This particular model is of
gold cloth figured with black com
bined with black chiffon over white
taffeta. Its deep yoke, graduated
flounce and lattice of black velvet with
jet spiders in the spaces are notable
features.
Notes From the Jewelers' Circular.
Some of the new silver bags are of
exceedingly fine mesh andalmost white
finish. They are drawn up on str'ings
that run through rings, and the top or
turnover flap is shaped in points, each
terminating in an irregular pearl or
other stone.
The peacock, vanity's emblem but
also the symbol of perfection in color,
furnishes- appropriate decoration on
combs and coiffure ornaments, the gold
and enamel showing to great adyantage
on the tortoise shell.

Cut two such pieces for the sides.
Put paste on the outer sides of the

Another strip of linei the same width

Effort and Its Effect.
It pays to think. It is like putting
moneyout at interest. Dollars make dol
lars, and thoughts make other thoughts.
We are so accustomed to having this
old world reward us for things we
do in dollars that we forget there is
such a reward as brains-mental
growth. Happy the one who sees all
these things in their proper light, who
recognises in every fatlure a lesson
learned, in every eth at riewiwrd, be it
unyt 'ltle nki a l
