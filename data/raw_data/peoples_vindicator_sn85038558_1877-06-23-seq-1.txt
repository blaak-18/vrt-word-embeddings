But little more than. forty years l,
ago, in the city of Boston, where e:
there are now upward of thirty large to
and thriving Catholic churchets and .
where a bishop of that faith has re
seat in a catlhedral of unusual bIag to
niticence, an infuriated Prostestant ali
mob pilnger and burned a convent fu
of the ordter of St. I'rsuia, occupied re
solely by women. The Stor'V of re
the o,,t ii:s not often ieen told ;at w
hleast, the liostoniaus of the present to
generation are tnt foud of relating it. in
1But a book just published by Mrs. 1
\hitney, a girl-pupi! of the convent r(
In Is: l, gives for the first time a nar- tl
rativ'e of the event lly eye witness 1'
from uwithin the pillaged house. ct
In the year just mentioned, the I(
fil(esi l'rsulnte ('onvent in New En- Ct
gland stood on Mount lhenedict, in i,
in lCharlestown. It was built ex- of
piresly for a boarding-school for the e cI
chillren of lich parents, 'Protestants ci
preferred, an imposing Iuiiling on
the suRlnnot of the hill, witil a back
ground of trees and a foreground of ri
green terraces bordered with shrub
b ery descending to the road, and1
having a lodge, a bishop's house, see\- ti
eral terra'ed walks, and grounds IP
tastefully laid out for the recreation i ,
of the pupils. These it attracted iun t
large numers, not only from the i n
wealty families of Boston, Iut evenl I a
froin (nCanada and the extiremie sonutl. a
lris. W hituney's father-she was then b
louisa Goddard-was "always la- a
menting tile growin, independence of io
women and the ditlficiity he found ill d
keeping his daughters unlder the old
rule of implicit obedience," hence lihe
resolved on sending her to the coni
vent, which she entered after the
suimmer voction of tI-:-14. l)r Lynman ,1
Beecher had, during thle precedinig t
winter, been denouncing liercely tl
"the devil and the pope" in a course P
of lectures deliveecd in Bloston ; Mr. p
Goihddard was a violent Unitariain, f
and resolved to educate his daughter a
at the convent from a spirit of antag- a ii
onism to I)r. lBeecher.
Behohl the little iirl, then intr,st- f
ed to the charge of the Sistels, a body t1
of liish nuns, elducatecd in Firench
convents. The suiperior was "t wo- ,tl
m1an of inediumi height and very I
stout, biibuhith the quick step and ,
vivacious air of a I.'reu'nc h- rishwo- I
man, and carritd heoself w ith a roy- R
al uprightness and dignity that com
pelled deference from all who ap
proached her." Shee-was, it further
appears, a womanu of great courage
and high-even violent-temper.
TIIE IEGINNING OF TiLE AITA.\TION. 1:
I)r. Beecher, it has just been said, a
had been fiercely denouncing Cath- r
olic convents, and had "enlightened I
thie people as to the depravity po- r'
pularly supposed to exist inside thleir
walls." At the same moment there c
was published a book called "Six t
(t Months in a Convent," the work of s
"silly, ignorant, deceitful gill, whom (
the superior had charitably taken I
into her employ as a seamstress,"
° which purported to relate the at
tempts to make a Catholic of the
author and heroine by force, and
ended with a melodramatic narrative
of her escape just as she was about to
-be secretly removed to St. Louis.
Mrs. Sherwood's "Nun" was another
- story that had just appeared to fas. o
cinate and prejndice more intelli
gent folks, while perverted reports of
a a not at all wonder ful incident fired
the Boston heart with a local anl I
, contemporary interest. The mother
- assistant of the convent, Sister Mary I
i John, principal teacher of music,
having been overworked in prepar
. ing for thie musical celebration with
which the academic year concluded,
. fell sick of brain fever, and one hot
day, eluding hIer nurses, fltied in her
t night-dress down to the house of a
IProtestont Yaunkee, Mr Cutter, just
i outside the grounds. 1le placed her
in clharge of his wife and gave the
news at the convent, and relmoved
her. "Some passers-by must have
wt itnessed the struggle that ensued I
_ when the poor sister, screaming andil
raving in delirium, was half forced 1
and ihalf persuaded into tile carriage,"
- hence it is not surprising that ii a
, few hours a starting story was ath)at
that a nun who had been imprisoned
ia in the underground cells of tile con
vent had at last escaped but had
been followed by the superior to the
house where she had taken refuge
and carried back to tile convent by
force, in spite of her desperate re
sistance. 'Thle oston truckmen were
then a well organized guild, and had
- warmly espoused thie cause of tihe
author of "Six Months in a Convent,"
fiuding her story fully confirmed, as
# they honestly believed, by the "es
cape ' and capture" of Sister Mary
- Johnu; they held secret indignation
Smeetings and many persons believed
' an attack on tile convent to be im
T pending. Mr. Goddard was warned
of this, but he and most sensible peo
pie thonght it impossible that any
danger was to be apprehended for a
school composed almost entirely of
l'Protustant scholars.
THIE MOB READY.
After a fortnight in the convent
o Miss Goddard was taken home for
one Sunday. LIe father drove her
back on thie following day, and on
S. tlheroad was stoppled by an old ac
Squaintance, whio laid hIis hand on the
reins and endeavored to induce himu
to turn back, vwhile hlie rapidly and
eagerly assured him that a mob would
probably destroy the convent that
night. Mr. Goddard ridiculed the
) idea and drove on. At the convent
rt the girl found the whole school in com
i: motion; no studying was going on,
Sand the girls were crowding round the
nuns or, unheeded, following their
own devices at their desks. From
time to time floating rumors of dan
ge'r had reaclhed the nns, but as the t11
bishop disbelieved in them so did the
; they. On the Saturday, however, tihe in
selectmen of Charlestown hadl formal- caI
ly notiliedijthe superior that the build- rii
Ing was in danger and had senta th(
cominiittee to consult with her as to stn
s her defense, and askes.pea ni.s-i-,uon to Sh
e examine the vaults so as to be able ithl
e to contradict the reports. that they ie
I were dungeons for the punishillent of pit
s refractory nuns and secret places of ih:l
tormen and iniqunity. She failed to sul
t appreciate their kind Motives, became erl
t furiously indigtant, hohling them gel
1 responsibile for the stories tlhey only ne
f repeated, and uvern tellmed them air
t with a torrent of invectives,, refusing Iit
t to anlow them to exanrine the build
ingi. Sister Mary John however, ex
plained to the c'limrittee the facts
t relative to her illness and its results ;
i they appeared to believe her, and ra
. ilirimised to publish an explanatoryi i fr
card. They dill so in the Monday pa- Ici
e pers, but it was coupled with an ae- til
' count of the superiors aTrrogatie lan ,
i her refttsal to allow an examination he
of the buiilding, and therefore in- lrl

APPROACHI OF TIlE MOB. Ill
s All the pupils went to bed at 7:l30 as
er usual, after the vesper bell and chanit I
. andl the excitement died away. Mliss
i. Goddard had slipped on hlier night- tl
of gown over the rest of her clothiing P
ad after taking offt her frock, and had a
ad not been discoveredl by thle iun in I
- chargo of the dormitory at retiring i
ry hour. Unable to sleep from the ex-.
ic, citement, and as well her unwontedly
r.- warm clothing, shie stole to the win- ri
th dow, raisedl it very gently and leaned
di out, giving herself up to the illusion.
ot of fiancyinig herself out in the night I
er alone, and all thie world else asleep. '.
a Thie convent stood so high that shIe
st seemed lifted up among the stars. j
er No sond was to lie heard but the ft
he kilu tires(in thie brick-making dis- tl
Bd trict at the foot ot the hill), the far c
e away bark of a dog, or the monotou- p
ed ous droning of the late grasshoppers. I
(d So cooling and sooting were thie
ed breeze and sounds of night that tihe a
child's head drooped lower and low- I
a er ; she made an effort to waken her- e
lat self, and openedl her sleelpy eyes to tl
ed their full width to see a bright falling- o
-. star curve down to thie htoison. For e
ad an instant she watched it; the next a
ie was the lirst momient in her lifo that e
ge shte realized thle meaning of tihe word a
y' itlipalledl,!' She heard a sound-a e
re- shout, a howl, what f-which chiil as I
re she was, she recognized. It came
ad from more than a mile away, fur the
lie mob gave one roar las it crossed Char
" lestown bridge, and then observed t
as profound silence till it reached tihe
e-. convent grounds.
try SURROUNDED IY DEMONS.
iD Tiere was, then, silence ; so long
ed maintained that the little watcher
n- almost fancied she had dreamned tile
led cry, when suddenly a horable yell
wo within a few yards of tihe window,
LnJ and a host of black figures rushed
a into view, turning tihe corner of the
of bishllop's house, rolling over tile
ground, as it seemed in the dim star
light, like a cloud. She ran to a com
panion's bed and shook her, scream
ngt ing, "Wake up, wake up ; the mob
for has really come." All the girls sud
her denly wakened, screaming in concert,
on and such a scene of confusion as can
ac- be imagined ensued, the terrified
the clildren thronging round the not less
ilu terrified nun, who kept hysterically
md imploring them to dress themselves
uld not an easy task in the panic and
hat with no light allowed, lest the atten
the tion of the mob should be attracted.
ent Now they heard two gunshots fired
m- in rapid succession outside, and
on, simultaneously loud screams from
the every dormitory. Some one rushed
ar in, crying, "They have shot the su
om perior; she went to the top of the
rD* high steps to speak with them, and
e they would'n listlen, andi they shot l at
:d her." Sister fMary, Astin sank batk ett
