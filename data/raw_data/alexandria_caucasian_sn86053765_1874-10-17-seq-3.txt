Camp Meetings are the Gentiles'
Feast of Tabernacles and no doubt
the idea of the present Camp Meet
ing, now a fixed institution m the
Methodist church in America, orig
inated in tbe Feast of Tabernacles
or Feast of Tents of tbe Jews, and
is therefore of diviue origin. This
feast with them is commemorative
of their fathers dwelling forty years
in tents, as travellers in the wilder
ness. If, was kept on the 15th ot
tbe month Tisri, tbe first of the
civil year, and all Israel were ob
year,
liged to attend the temple and to
dwell eight days under tents of
bmncbes in memory of the passage
of tbe children <>• Israel through tbe
wilderness. 'I his seems to be the
origin of Cauip Meetings. Tbe
present Cainp Meetings however
have no social signification to any
great event to be remembered but
are just what the name means in
Methodist phraseology, a meeting
iu camps, iu which everybody that
attends Is expected to stay on the
ground and give their whole time
and attention to the meeting, that
is preaching, praying, singing and
urging people to a better life. The
great objective point of the''meet
ing is for the conversion ot men to
Christ, and every thing converges
to that point. The great utility of
Camp Meetings lies in the fact, that
they reach a great many people
that can be reached by no other
means. The word of God is read
and discussed here, and the Gospel
is not here given in broken doses as
elsewhere, once a week or once a
month, but all nay and all night.—
A man coming to a Camp Meeting
can't help receiving some religious
influence. Every body is expected
at the camp, all denominations ami
all classes, the rich and the poor.
and hence their great lise. Like
every Oilier religious institution, J
Siiiiionf t l'if» " "J"
, .s um ot the good people
ot .Alexamilia look lipon them as
indecent aud unfit tobe attended

Of the • interference of President
Grant with the revolution in Lou
isiana, the N. Y. Day-Book goes on
to say :
But is the part that Grant, who
is "the Federal Government," plays
in this Louisiana revolution to be
tolerated by tbe other States of this
great Confederncy ? Have the peo
pie of a State no redress tor such
terrible wrongs as Louisiana and
South Carolina are now siiileriug
from Î Louisiana is to be made to
writhe under the torture of nigger
rule, at least uutil January 1, 1877,
and bow much longer God only
knows, aud her a bused people must
submit. We desire to say to Gen
Grant, Presideut of the United
States, that the people of Louisia
na, or the people »if New York,
have a IIeaven-ordained right—a
right above all human laws or en
actments—to the preservation, at
all hazards, ofthat condition, State
or National, which shall permit
their "enjoyment of life, liberty and
the pursuit, of happiness and
when the State Governments, or
the National Government, are base
enough to seek to destroy that
Heaveii-ordainetl right, such a State
power, or such a Federal power,
should be resisted to the very last.
