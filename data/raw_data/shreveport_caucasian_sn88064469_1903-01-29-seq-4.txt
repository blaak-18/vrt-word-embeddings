A SPECIAL FROM SHREVEPORT
"A Severe Throw-Down for the Admin
istration of Mayor Querbes."
In the Picayune of Tuesday, January
20, is published in the columns of "Lat
est News in Louisiana" a special dated
at Shreveport January 19, of which the
paragraph quoted as follows is the
feature of prominence although sand
wiched between other items:
"There was considerable discussion
over the ordinance to provide for the
removal of screens from saloons which
would obstruct the view on Sunday.
i The ordinance was defeated by a vote of
8 .to 6. This was regarded as a severe
throw-down for the administrationi of
Mayor Andrew Querbes, who tried hard
to get the ordinance through. An ordi
nance was passed providing for the
erection of safety gates at all railroad
crossingS."
Without assuming or presuming to be
a champion of Mayor Querbes or of his
administration, the Caucasian, without
reserve or hesitation, must declare that
this statement is as ungenerous and it
is unfounded. There is manifest in every
line of this exaggeration a spirit of po
litical antagonism which may have been
suggested with the view and for the
purpose of reflecting discredit and odium
on Mayor Querbes and his administra
tion. It will not be gainsaid nor can it
be disguised that the recent success of
what is styled the Querbes wing or fac
tion in politics is regarded with signifi
cance throughout the State by all poli
ticians of practical experience and has,
as has been pointed out by the Caucas
ian, the agitation for the repeal of the
Sunday law, precipitated on the public
recently was designed in no friendli
ness for the Querbes administration.
The suggestion of the repeal of the
Supday ordinance was checked by a
demonstration of public sentiment and
the' fact that even if repealed, the State
law would stand and that Mayor
Querbes would give it loyal support.
But there is the fact, the bold, stern fact
- a ajority of the council, ten if
t, more, of, the fifteen were and are
diay opposed to the repeal of the
Siday law ordinance and will'uphold

forcement; and with this condition was
the question whether the ordinance
should be withdrawn or permitted to go
to a vote for final decision. Candidly it
would not have been good policy to
have withdrawn the "rdinance, afer it
t had been submitted, an ! the only reas
onable and logical course was to permit
its acceptanbe or its defeat. After all
the mayor has no authority to legislate;
his functions and duties require his en
forcement of all ordinances. It is true
the mayor suggested the screen ordi
nance as a means of simplifying the en
forcement of the Sunday law ordinance
by the police, but because the anti
screen ordinance did not become law is
no reason why it should be charged that

Great Men Are Soon Forgotten I.
Maelstrom of Gotham.
Probably there is no great city in the
world where a "has been," in official
life especially and in business spheres
generally, sinks so quickly into oblivion
as in New York city. A man may
have been even a president of the Unit
ed States or a governor of the state,
and he can meander day in and day
out down Broadway, from Longacre
square to the Battery., without once
being recognized in the "madding
crowd." Only a short time ago a
friend stood right in front of the Fifth
Avenue hotel chatting with a man
whom he had greeted as he was pass
-ing. "I suppose you know to whom I
was talking," he remarked to a friend.
The friend-who, by the way, was one
of New York's leading politicians
said that the face was somewhat fa
miliar to him. "I've an idea," said
he, "I've seen that man down .on the
Stock Exchange very often. He's a
broker, I think." Alas, poor Yorick!
He did not recognize Daniel Lamont,
ex-secretary of War and ex many other
things before he was secretary of war.
A man who was once vice president
of the United States, once governor of
this state, once United States ambas
sador to France was passing down
Fifth avqnue, near the Holland House,
recently; says a correspondent of the
Pittsbu g Dispatch. The only person
who seemind to know who he was was
a newsboy. "Have a paper, guv?"
asked the4ittle fellow. "Why d'ye call
that old gentleman 'guy?'" asked the
know it all policeman on the corner,
with a sneer. "'Cause he was, that's
alt" And Levi P. Morton walked on
smiling~
One of the most striking Illustrations
of this sinking out of mind of once fa
mous men-famous as leading lights in
the city Itself-was given when Presi
dent Roosevelt was here a short time
ago. Four men happened. to meet in
the corridor of the Waldorf. They were
laughing: and shaking hands when a
liftsB camealong. He remarked; "Some
pe~6il *i fl think this is a 'combine' for
a pftro~e'The crowd surged past the

at times: but not a soul recognized them
ekceeit -a newspaper man. "Do you
knowt alny onea of those men there?" he
assked a pretty well posted man about
to0wn. "Don't know as I do," was the
reply?' Such is fame. Those five men
were :Messrs. Hewitt, Cooper, Ely, Gil
rd' and -i@ant. They were all ex-may

A lseding New York detective said
one day-as he stood watching the mass

FRANKLIN'S GREAT TRIUMPH
He \Vore His Old Spotted Velvet Sui
on Two Occasions.
When the Treaty of Paris. which es
tablished peace between the Unite(
States and England, had been finally
signed and sealed, Franklin tuied to
the English commissioners:
"Gentlemen," he said, "I observet
you cast an eye upon this old, spotted
velvet suit I wear. Let me tell you whai
I would have you tell to England. Once
years ago, when these differences w(
have just concluded lay, still in the seed
I bore a petition to your English privy
council. I was laughed and jeered at,
if you will, as an outlander and a sav
age of no rights, by the grave chief jus
tice and his associates. They put for
ward a Scotch cur, one Wedderburn, to
mouth and worry me. I was helpless,
with no friend save my conscience. On
that, my day of heaviest burden, I was
garbed in these spotted velvet clothes.
I will not pretend I was unmoved, and
in my hate and rancor of the moment
I made a mental vow that this raiment,
worn in the hour of my humiliation, I
would yet wear in the hour of British
hutniliation and defeat. From that day
to this I have laid these garments by;
and now, please God, I keep my vow
and put them on."-Alfred Henry Lewis
