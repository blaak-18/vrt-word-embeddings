A MAGAZINE FOR THE HOME.
One of the most attractive of the
February magazines is Conkey's Home
Journal (Chicago). It has a striking
Valentine poster cover design in colors
and its contents are thoroughly prac
ticl for the home. It is one of.the very
fed magazines whose contributors write
with the definite purpose of being clear
tly understood. The subjects of the ar
tides are always attractive and the arti
cles the; selves neve? fail to do justice
to the subjects. .Noticeable in the Feb
uary issue is the first of a series of les
sonr IR "E.mbroidery, Making" and
" m Millinerv." The fashion and
pa dpatmnts are letter than

He joins the Negrophoiists in Denun
ciation of the South.
Tf:e indignation aroused by the ii
tiamnmatory harangue in Washington.
D. C., recently by the negro. Hayes. has
scarcely been lulled when the negro
queiion is again revived by Rev. Dr.
i'ertkhiurst, who has joined the negroph
1iss in denunciation of the South. In
,is announcements from his pulpit last
Sunday he stated that "the \i dnesday
eventng prayer meeting there would he
an address by the Rev. W. H. Mitchell,
a missionary of the Freedmen's Board,
in South Carolina. Booker T. Washing
ton has informed Dr. Parkhurst that
the Rev. Mr. Mitchell is a reliable man.
It making the announcement Dr. Park
hurst said: 'Even at this day. so long
after the proclamation of emancipation,
there is, in many parts of the South, a
condition of veritable slavery. Although
we claim to he a civilized people, there
is a degree of harbarism in our treat
.ment of the black race that is not ex
s ceeded in any part of the world. And.
although we send out missionaries to
Christianize other lands, there are com
munities in the South as unchristian as
any part of heathenism.'"
His denunciations were so rank as to
call a challenge from a Southern man
who was in the church. A sensation fol
lowed naturally and after church Rev.
Dr. Parkhurst met the Southern gentle
man, who was in waiting to meet him,
who tried to diaabuse the mind of this
" minister, who, however, would not be
r convinced against his ill. The abuse and
the villification of the South by the
negre-lawyer, Hayes, . is not surprising,
but it is shocking to think that a man
who towers in intellect and information,
one who is presumed to be a teacher and
a leader, an example for others to fol
low, should have descended to the level
of a negro firebrand 'in his denunciation
of the South. But why waste space or
time on a man who, as a minister, stands
as a fase pretense, a great misfit who
may draw, if not too deep dyed in cus
setdsess and prejudice, some informa
tion frta the remarks of Bishop Smith,
an able negro divine of New Orleans,
Iko after condemning in unmeasured
Words the incendiary ravings of the
igo4awyerr Hayes and at the same
tiW disapproving the policy of Presi
yeut Raose'velt as to the Negro, said:

Bowen, Venezuela's representative in I
the negotiations at Washington for a
settlement of the ciJtms against that I
I country,, has sent through the British
. ambassadfor at Washington what I
1 amounts to an ulltikatum to the allied t
powers of Great Britain, Germany and

Norway and Sweden content them
selves with the remaining one-third of
this perceatage: that It, 10 per cent of

In the note received by the British
ambassador from Mr. Bowen the lat
ter refuses point blank the proposal foi
a 20 and 10 per cent division on the
ground to recognise the princiuple it
e embodies it would.be absolutely often

of the fact that the negotiators are

FAITHFUL DAD.
We happened in a home the other
night and over the parlor door saw the
legend worked in letters of red: "What
is home without a mother." Across the
room was another brief "God bless our
home."
Now, what's the matter with "God
bless our dad"? He gets up early, lights
the fire, boils an egg, grabs his dinner
pail and wipes off the dew of the dawn
with his boots while many a mother is
sleeping. He makes the weekly handout
for the butcher, the grocer, the milk
man and baker, and his little pile is bad
ly worn before he has been home an
hour. He stands off the bailiff and keeps
the rent paid up.
If there is a noise during the night
dad is kicked in the back and made to
go downstairs to find the burglar and
kill him. Mother darns the socks, but
dad bought the socks in the first place
and the needles and the yarn afterward.
Mother does upp the fruit; well, dad
bought it all, and jars and sugar cost
like the mischief.
Dad buys chickens for the Sunday
dinner, carves them himself and draws
the neck from the ruins after every one
else is served. "What is home without
a mother ?" Yes, that is all right; but
what is home without. a father? Ten
chances to one it is a boarding house,
father is under a slab and the landlady
is the widow. Dad, here's to you;
you've got your fauiss-you may have
lots of 'em-but you're all right, and we
will; miss you when you're gone.
