THE REPUBLICAN PROGRAMMS.
scheme of the Proteetltesate ter Rlasing
the Rtvense.
The Washligton correspondenit of
the Chicago Tribune is authority for
the announeestent that the republican
leaders have practically agreed upon
their flnancial progranreae for the eom
ing session of Congress. "The idea bf
more revenue through a 'evrtiHe tariff
on wool, with the Allison notes for
emergencies, will be the republican
financial scheme," says this corre
spondent.
Whether he has learned this directly
from the republicans or by making a
survey of the situation on his dwn 's
count, very likely he I. rigt. The
republican leadeert ay not have come
to a dlatirlet auderstanding yet, but
logically they cannot vote to increase
the revenue without at the same time
voting to protect somebody: Jttst nOre
the wool growers ate~ the Most clam
orous of all the late republican pi
teges, and naturally their demanrds
will be the first considetred. Other
producers of s'* materials. such as
coal and iron ore, are still protected to
some extent. and there will be a cer
tain degree of plausibility in the claim
that the farmers who grow wool are as
much entitled to protection as the cap
italists who are concerned in the pro
duction of other raw materials.
IBut the republicans . cannot well
vote to Increase the duties on wool
without at the same time Voting to in
crease the duties on woolen goods.
Lhe woulen manufacturers must have
more protection if the price of their
raw material is to be increased by pro
tective duties. The republicans al
ways have legislated upon this prin
ciple and they always must adhere to
it, not only for the sake of consistency,
but also in order to retain the support
of their most valuable allies, the manu
facturers.
When they increase the duties on
manufactures of wool in order to com
pensate for the duties imposed on the
raw material they will admit that the
effect of a duty, or, at least, the in
tended effect, is to raise the price of
the article on which it is laid. They
admit that a duty on wool is intended
to-raise the price of wool. They must,
then, admit that an increase in the
duties on woolen goods is intended to
increase the price of those goods.
Otherwise raising those duties would
not compensate at all for the duties
laid on wool. Are the republicans pre
spared to admit that they wish to in
crease the prices of all woolen goods?
What do they think consumers will
have to say to that? They must make
the admission, and the democrats are
willing that they should.
As for the "Allison notes," it will be
necessary to issue securities of some
kind if the government needs thirty
million dollars more revenue, as the
republicans claim, and if no more rev
enue is to be provided except from
wool. No duties which the republic
anns will dare propose on wool and
woolens would provide more than half
that sum.
It is estimated that this republican
programme has been agreed upon on
the assumption that the administra
tion will not take the responsibility of
recommending any plan for raising
more revenue. "The administration,"
we are told, "wnould like the revenue
without the responsibility." If the re
publican programme is wholly contin
gent upon this assumption we may rest
assured that it will never be entered
upon. President Cleveland has never
yet hesitated to recommend any meas
ure that he deemed necessary or of
great importance and there is no rea
son to think that he is going to show
the political white feather at this late
day. If he thinks there is a real need
for more revenue he will not hesitate
to say so or to let congress know that
what he wants is revenue and enough
of it, and not tariff protection for the
Ohio shepherds or anybody else.--Chi
cago Chronicle.
WHEAT EXPORTS.
Improving Conditions Under the Wilson
Law.
A high tariff contemporary claims
that Europe bought more "high-priced
wheat from us under the McKinley
law than low-priced wheat under the
Wilson law."
Yes, it did in 1892 because of crop
shortages that year and the year be
fore in Europe. Crop danages were so
great that some of the European coun
tries suspended their duties on grain
and otherwise favored by legislation
the import of American wheat. But
McKinleyism couldn't help our farmers
after that. Not only did our wheat
exports fall off in 1893 over forty mil
lion bushels, but the price per bushel
fell twenty per cent.
Instead of recovering the lost ground
in the next year of McKinlecyism,
wheat continued to fall in price. Not
until the Wilson bill had taken effect
was any improvement perceptible.
The average export price of No. i red
wheat has been higher this year than
at any time since Europe's crop short
age in 1802. The average for the year
has also been higher than during the
corresponding period of last year un
der the McKinley bill
When we compare quantities we find
that up to the 1st of August about
two million three hundred thousand
bushels more were exported than dur
ing the corresponding period of last
year. Our crop shortage this year in
winter wheat cut dowvn exports consid
ably until the spring wheat crop was
harvested, but since the middle of Sep
temtr they have exceeded last year's
exports. We are ahead now of 189
and are likely to make gains every
week for several months over the year
1893 as well as last year. WVheat ii
higher now than it was a year ago and
as high as it was in October, 1893.
There is this differ-.nce, however.
WVhile the tendency of the market two
years ago wasdownward it is now up

- Delusive comparisons of our trade

On March 1, 182, the Iron Age re
ported the Weekly Production of
Amrerican fursiaces to be 1983,933 tons
of iron. This was the largest produic
tion ever attained up to that date. It
was high-water mark under the Me
Kinley bill or any previous tariff bill.
It was never equtale:d in any subsee
quent week before the repeal of the
MeKin!ey act.
On August 1, 1894, the beginning of
the last month of the life of the "bill
of abomination," the weekly produc
tion of the furnaces was 115,113 torts.
On August 28 the new tariff bill be
came a law. On September 1, 1894, the
weekly capacity of the furnaces h-ad
risen to 151,311 tons. A year later, on
September 1, 1895, the weekly output
had risen to 194,020.
This is not a large increase over the
greatest previous production, but it is
an increase. It is a new high-water
mnark, established under a tariff law
which, however imperfect from the
standpoint of tariff reform, was con
demned everywhere in protection
circles as a free trade measure and as
certain to ruin our industries. Against
these reckless and unfsunded predic
tions, which we denoundd at the timue
they were made, we hart the satisfac
tion of setting the testil-.ony of a pro
tection author that the barometer of
trade" now registers a higher figure
than it ever did before.-Louisvi.tle

SADDENED BY PROSPERITY.
JRepublicans Distressed by Impneved Busa
ness Conditions.
The improvement in the finances of
the country and in the general contli
tion of business has disclosed the ex
istence of a painful state of min d
among the editors of certain republic
an papers. The announcement that
the receipts of the treasury for the
month will exceed the disbursements
causes them deep distress. The esti
mate that the continuous deficit of the
past two years will hereafter be re
placed by a steadily increasing sur
plus is received by them with every
indication of genuine sorrow. They
try not to believe it.
They even go so far as to argue
that it must be a mistake. They ac
cuse the treasury department of with
holding payments, of starving the
government service, of jugglil-g with
the transaction of public busi0ess, of
seeking to force a balance for the pur
pose of influencing the elections.
What kind of Americans are these
whose hearts are saddened at the evi
dences of their country's prosperity?
What kind of patriotism is it which
carries partisanship to such an ex
treme? Above all, t-here is the Intel
ligence in acting the part of a mere
calamity howler in a country in which
prosperity is inevitable?-N. Y. World.

WHALES' LEAPS.

the Aeejs.
".peaaking of jdmpitig:" stid an old
seaman iw-ho had o e~ n Wdit!iil bointi
boys playing leapfrog on the sands;
"let me tell you df the greatest jump
e'cei seeii. It di4o many years ago;
when I was little more than a tael, lunt
I was bow oarsman on a whaleboat be=
S9nging try the ship Henry Staples.
We had i had t&d !sitit for several
weeks, when one day we sighted a oig
whale, atnd two boats set off in n race
to see wild swould get there first. It
was fairly sitootti, ithitt the sailors
call a white-cap bireeze. and our boats
fairly flew over the water. Finally
the whale rose not over one hundred
'at'cs *ahas leleddiiig tditietly for us.
The harpooner stood with his iron
all ready to throw, while we grasped
our bais hervotisly; prepared to
jnump it the word 'stei'nl tal,'
that nearly always came when a whale
was harpooned. Not a word was
spoken, and suddenly a mountain of
black appeetred: it seeided to shut off
the entire horizon. Up it went until I
distinctly saw it seventy'foot whale
over twenty feet in the air hovering
over us.
"Trie mate was the first to regain
his senses, and gave the, command
'stern all.' Just as we were ready to
apring overboard the boat shot back
several feet, and the next second the
gigantic animal dived into the ocean,
just grazing us, having completely
passed ovet the boat in the biggest
leap I ever heard off."
Such gigantic leaps are rare. A
similar one was recorded by Dr. [Hail.
who a.t the time was a midshipman on
the ship Leander. They were lying in
the harbor of Bermuda. when all hands
were attracted by the appearanoe of
a very large whale that stiddetdly ap
peared in the 'harbor and seemed very
much alarmed by the shallow water,
floundering about violently. The
young midshipman joined a boat's
crew that started in pursuit, and just
is they were about to strike the whale
disappeared, sinking out of sight, lear
ing a deep whirlpool. around which
the boat. shot. Before it stopped up
came the whale,having in all probabili
ty struck the bottom and went into the
air like a rocket. "So complete was
the enormous leap," says Dr. Hall,
"that for an instant we saw him fairly
up in the air, in a horizontal position,
at a distance of at least twenty per
pendIcular feet over our heads. While
in his progress upward there was in
his spring some touch of the vivacity
with which a trout or salmon shoots
out of the water, but he fell back
again in the sea like a huge log thrown
on its broadside. and with such a
thundering crash as made all hands
stare with astonishment, and the bold
est held his breath for a time. Had
the whale taken his leap one minute
sooner he would have fallen plump on
the boat."
Comparatively few people have seen
a large whale, but we can imagine
what an animal seventy feet long and
weighing as many tons would be flying
through the air.
Within a week of the writing of the
present article I was drifting along the
shores of Santa Catalina island, Cali
fornia, when a sixty-foot whale almost
cleared the water about a thousand
yards from the boat. I was about to
aski the boatman what rock it was,
when the great head descended and
the tail rose into the air as the monster
dived.
MIr. Scorsby, the famous whaler,
chronicles a number of incidents of
jumping among whales, some leaving
the water completely and rising twen
ty or more feet into the air.
Many of the inhabitants of the sea
are good jumpers, and some have be
come famous. Among them should
be mentioned the tarpon or silver
king,a huge fish with scales that gleam
like silver, which constitutes the fa
mous game fish of Florida. The leaps
of this beautiful creature are often as
tonishing. Several years ago a steam
er was rushing down the St. John's
river. The captain was sitting on the
fore deck leaning against the pilot
house, when suddenly there rose in
the air a beautiful shining fish four
feet in length. It came like an arrow
and landed in the lap of the captain as
neatly as though it had been placed
there.
In Pacific waters the tuna, an ally of
the horse mackerel, is noted for its
leaps. Sometimes a school sweeps up
the coast, and the powerful fish, often
weighing eight pounds, are seen in the
air in every direction. They are like
an arrow, turn gracefully five or six
feet in the air and come down, keeping
the water for acres in a foam, and, if
not the greatest jumpers,they are cer
tainly the most graceful of the leap
ers of the sea.-Philadelphia Times.
tIrlognlg Down the Mtoon.
A voyage to the moon is the latest
project which is seriously put forward
as the crowning point of the exhibi
tion of 1000. M. .Mantois, its author,
does no propose to carry passengers to
the lunar regions in an aerial car, but
he expects to bring down the moon to
thle reach of people whose vision ex
tends, say, six miles from the earth.
The plan is to construct a telescope
nearly two hundred feet in length.
The objective glass will ]hare a diam
eter of something over four feet three
inches, the largest in the word. Tihe
colossal tube will be placed horizont
ally, and the image of the moon will
be reflected by what is termed a mir
ror plane, six feet in diameter and fif
teen Inches thicec. The weight would
be eighty-five hundred pounds. The
special feature of the idea is that the
image of the moon should be thrown
upon a screen placed in a hall large
enough to hold six hundred specta
tors. Astronomers calculate that with
an apparatus of these dimensions it
will be possible to discern easily ob
jects of the size of the Notre Dame Ca

Thie most ctlriovts imitation which we
find in dogs is as to the menasure of ex
praioit to which they have attained.
Among the savage forefathers of the
modern dog the characteristic of all
their utterance was, to a great extent,
involititafy, and once begun the out
c:y was cobtnttted in a mechanical
manner.
Thin .ffeet of advancing culture on
the dog, howedvte, has been gradually
to decrease this alcientt undif
ferentiated mode of expressiod by
howllng and yelping, and te
replace it by the nmuch more speech
like bark. There is some doubt
whether dogs possessed by savages
have the power of uttering the sharp,
specialized note which is so character
istic ,f the civilized form of their
spedies
It is clear, hlowever, that if they have
the power of thus expressing them
selves they use it but rarely. On the
other hand, our high-bred dogs have
to a great extent lost the power to ex
press themselves in the ancient way.
Many of our breeds appear to have be
come incapable of ululating. There is
no doubt but the change in the mode
of expression greatly increases the
Capacity of our dogs to set forth their
states of mind.
If we catch a high-bred dog-one
with a wide range of sensibilities,
wvhich we may find in breeds which
have long been closely associated with
mnan-wo may readily note five or six
varieties of sound in the bark, each of
which is clearly related to a certain
state of mind. That of welcome, of
fear, of rage, of doubt, and of pure fun
are almost always perfectly distinct to
tihe educated ear.and this.although the
observer may not be acquainted with
tihe creature. If he knows him well
lie may be able to distinguish various
other intonations-those which ex
press impatience, and even an element
of sorrow. This last note verges to
ward a howl.-Secribner's Magazine.

The improvements which V. H. Soul
by has lately added to the microphone,
or "sound magnifier," makes it one of
the most marvelous mechanical con
trivances of the age. The special con
struction of this instrument is of no
par'ticular interest to anyone except
experts, but what is told of its wonder
ful powers as a magnifier of sounds
will entertain the young and old, as
well as the scientific and unscientific.
After the instrument had been com
pleted, with the exception of a few fin
ishing touches, Soulby found it abso
lutely necessary to keep the door of
his workshop tightly closed so as to ad
mit no sounds from the outside, other
wise the inarticulate rumblings given
off by the "ejector" would have be
come unbearable. Even with closed
doors the cap had to be kept constant
ly in place on the receiver to keep the
instrument from sending forth a roar,
which previous investigation had
proved to be a combination of sounds
produced by watch beats, breathing,
the hum of flies, etc.
A fly walking across the receiver of
the instrument made a sound equal to
a horse crossing a bridge, and when
Mr. Soulby laid his arm across the box
the blood rushing in his veins gave
forth a sound which much resembled
that made by the pump of a large
steam engine. The playing of a piano
in a house across the street was, when
ejected from Soulby's machine, like
the roar of an avalanche, and the
washing of dishes in the kitchen of a
house across the alley made a sound
which the inventor of the machine says
was "a burden to his soul." When
anyone entered the room, walked
about, coughed, touched the table or
door handles, the shriek which issued
fromu the ejector was most painful to
hear.
Hlundreds of uses have been sug
gested for the microphone, the most
practical being those of blood circula
tion and lung tests.-St. Louis Re
public.
The Absence of Odor.
The girl of small experience with the
ways of cologne and sachet makers
finds it difficult to resist such alluring
titles as "White Rose," "New Mown
Iiay" and "Wood Violet." She may not
possess a sufficiently cultivated sense
of smell to perceive how crude and ob
noxious these perfumes, when of tlhe
clleaper varieties, really are, and she
is too apt to drench herself with them.
The "tawny" tresses of one of Amelie
1ives' erratic heroines are described as
exhailing a natural perfume, which
with righteous vehemence is declared
for being "Lubin's Extract." And Hen
