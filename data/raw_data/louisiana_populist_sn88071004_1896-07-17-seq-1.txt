People's Party Platform. J
FOUNDATION PRINCIPLES.
First-That union of the labor
forces of the United States this day
consuimmated shall be permanent /
andl perpetual, may its spirit enter
all hearts for the salvation of the
republic and the uplifting of man
kind.
Second--VVealth helongs to him
who creates it, and every dollar o
taken from industry without an js
equivalent is roblbery. "If any will q
not work, neither shall lie eat."
The interests of rural and civic
labor are the same; their interests
are identical.
Third-We delieve that the time
has come when the railroad cort,º
rations will either own the popl t
or the people must own the rail
roads, and should the governmant
enter upon the work of owing or
managing any or ti11 og the rail- P
roads, we should favor an mlnend
ment to tile constitution by which
all persons engagad in tha. govern
ment serviec shall be placed under
a civil service regulation of the
most . rigid character, so as to C
prevent the increase of the power
of the national admi,i;strstion by
the use of such additional overn
ment empioyes. h
FINANCE
First-We demand a national
currency--&te, sound and flexible
-issued by tlhe general govern
ment only, a full legal tender for gf
all dobts, public and private, and t
that without the use of banking
corporations, a just, equitable and I
efficient means of distributing di
rect to the people at a tax not to t
exceed 2 Ier cent per annum to be
provided as set forth in the sub
treasury plan of the Farmers' Al
liance or a better system; also by ,
payments in discharge of its obli- e
gations for public Improvements. e
We demand the free and unlimi
ted coinage of silver and gold at
the present legal ratio of 16 to 1.
We demand that the 'amnount of
circulating medium he speedily in
creased to not less than *540 pewr
caidta.
We demand a graduated1 income
tax.
We believe that the money of
the country should be kept as mlnch
as possible in tie hands of the peo
ile. and hence we demand that all
state and national revenues shall
be limited to the necessary expen
ses of the government economical
ly and honestly administered.
" We demand that the postal a- 1
vings bank Tbe establishcd by the
government for the safe deposit of ;
the earnings of the people and to t
facilitate exehange. I
TRANSPORTATION.
Second-Transportation being a r
means of exchange and public ne- 1
cesity the government should own t
and operate the railroads in the
Interest of the people. t
The telegraph and the telephone, I
like the post office system, being a
necessity for the transmission of 1
news, should be orwned and opera
ted by the government in the in- I
terest of the people.
LANIuS.
I Third-The lasdsliucluding all
the resourees of wealth is the heri
tage of the peoe and should not
be emepoHad srapeelntiive pur
pos, and alise ownership should
be piobibited. And lands now
bed by railroads sad other corpo
rations ma excess of their aetual
needs and all lands now owned by (
alies Jasld be relaimed by the
government for actual purposes

IHere is a story of their doings,
as another has told it : "The most
insignificant insects and reptiles GI
are of much more consequence
and have much more influence in
the economy of nature than the
most incurious are aware of. Farth
worms, though in appearance a
small and despicable link in the Bid
chain of nature, yet if lost, would re
make a lamentable chasm. Worms in
seem to be the great promoters of to'
vegetation, which would proceed tbh
but lamely without them, by boring, P"
by boring, perforating and loosen- ca
ing the soil, and rendering it per- V1
vious to rains and the fibers of
plants; by drawing straws and t'
stalks of leaves into it ; and, most ("
of all, by throwing up such infinite he
numbers of lumps of earth called do
I worm-casts, which, being their ex
crement, is fine manure for grain foi
and grass. The earth without (a
r worms would seem become cold, f(e
hard-bound and void of fermenta- th
tion, and consequently, sterile." & me

Editor Louislana Populist-Kind
Sir---. have just been reading the
resoiutions adopted by the Pop,
in some of the wards of Natchi
toches parish, and it seems that
there is a general dissatisfaetion
prevailin in that part of the Fpliti.
cally degraded part of Gods moral
vineyard. Of course we are satis
fled about the way the election
turned out down here in lirpidel
(m a horn).
P,,it 'c are sinoen pire down
here, yes pire and sweet as a deadl
dog.
Of course the t'opn are to blame
for their defeat, they all votedl
(at least all whose nantes were
found on the poll books). And
there ia one thing that snrpreMas
me yet most of ill, and that is
why Foster's majority was so small.
Why Mr. Editor be should have
carried this parish by at least
500,000. He he-dal-goily-woggledl
if it was the fault of the p arty
that he came out with such a
small majority. They tried to do
better, and if I were him I would
have the election over.
I believe in the Governor coma
ing out at the big end of the
horn.
Now If he lhad received ials jdst
rights, he would have carried the
sweet simon pure ballot-box qt4tff
ing white supremacy negro doemi
nating state; at least 17 million,
His party would have been
willing for him to have done so
and it was not their fallt that
he did not do better, for they'
counted for hinm until they turned
green in the face, and lost their
breath and had to throw up the
sponge and let it go at wbat it
was worth.
But I am not just satisaed the
count have been so large should
that there was no room for the
opposing candidates, but it didn't
as it shows that Pharr got some
vote. I seeil isoNme of their wen
paiPrs that he carried the white
mpari.blle if that is so, Poster got
the parishes which are inrhabited
by '*oeoom., Were I Mrs. Poster
I'de not like that one bit4
Well Mr, Edlitor, the petlie of
your lpatsh have the sympathy of
,the liberty.l-ving Iveople of Hap
ides parish.
Stand to yaour rightlta~ peef~ealiy
if possible, otherwise if foreed to
