Facts and Fancies for the Fireside
THE JAMESTOWN STAMPS.
Bust of Pocahontas to Appear on Five-
Cent Denomination.
(The New York Tribune.)
Postmaster General Meyer has sign
ed an order for the issue of a five-cent
Jamestown Exposition stamp. This
completes the scries of stamps to com
memorate the celebration of the set
tlement at Jamestown this summer,
orders having already been given for
one-cent and two-cent stamps.
The five cent stamp is intended pri
marily for foreign letters. The pres
ence of foreign ships at Hampton
Roads, together with foreign tourists,
is taken as an assurance that there
will be a large demand for a five-cent
stamp. The stamp will bear a bust
of Pocahontas. It had been decided
that only one and two cent stamps
would be issued in connection with the
celebration, but the demand for some
special honor to Pocahontas induced
Postmaster General Meyer to reconsid
er the decision of the department.
That a likeness of Pocahontas should
be selected for the “foreign” stamp is
thought especially fitting, as she was
the first Indian woman to go abroad.
Like the one and two cent stamps,
the five-cent stamp will be of oblong
shape, differing in size from the Pan-
American stamps by just one-sixteenth
of an inch. The five-cent stamp will
be printed in blue, the one-cent in
green, and the two-cent in red. The
one-cent stamp will bear a likeness of
Captain John Smith and the two-cent
stamp a -scene of the landing of the
Jamestown settlers in 1607. All the
designs, which have been prepared by
the bureau of engraving and printing,
are highly ornamental, bearing, besides
the principal features, borders of pat
riotic emblems.
The stamps will be printed imme
diately and will be placed on sale in
all postoffices in the United States on
the opening day of the exposition,
April 26.
FEBRUARY HAS THIRTY DAYS.
Can there legitimately be a Febru
ary 30? Yes, under very exceptional
circumstances. That is to say, if you
happen to be voyaging across the Pa
cific at the end of February during
a leap year. A contributor to Notes
and Queries, looking over a collec
tion of menu cards, found one dated
Febuary 30, 1904. At first he thought
it was a printer’s error, but he after
ward ascertained that it was quite cor
rect. The dinner was given on board
the Pacific steamer Siberia while crots.

SPRING BEAUTY DIET.
For girls working in offices oranges
are invaluable food, if they did but
know it. One after luncheon will piece
out that meal most satisfactorily, and
many times it would be possible to
have one of the fruit kept in a desk
drawer to be eaten in the afternoon
when one is tired, at the same time
not stopping work. A little food is
a great stimulant when body and mind
are fatigued.
Green salads, such as lettuce, en
dive, chicory, and the like are skin
■Whiteners and excellent food. ' They
are appetizing, and the oil eaten on
them is nourishing and fat making.
If one will finish her lunch or dinner
with a good salad and cheese instead
of sweets she will be better off and
look better.
A PREMIUM ON COWARDICE.
Several darkies stood on a street
corner in Atlanta, gossiping. The dis
cussion turned to a question of per
sonal bravery.
Jum Judd was the principal expoun
der along the line of heroic conduct.
Unfortunately, Jim’s reputation for
courage was not without serious flaws.
Tiring of his talk, one of the listeners
sneeringly said:
“Wha’ yo’ talkin’ ’bout Jim? Yo’ de
bigges’ coward in dis town.”
Jim turned on his accuser, unuttera
ble scorn in his voice:
“Yas, dat’s so. But I’d rudder heah
dem say, ‘Watch dat niggah run!’ dan
‘Don’ he look natch’al?’” —J. C. R., in
the Saturday Evening Post.

LIGHTNING ROD AGENTS.
(The Philadelphia Record.)
The Pennsylvania county papers are
warning farmers against a scoundrel
who has been operating a new scheme
successfully. He is selling a stretch
er for barbed wire fencing. The ma
chine and a section of fence is left
with farmers and a contract signed
for $3, to be paid in case the stretch
er is accepted. The swindler never
again appears, but, later, the signer
is confronted with a note in the hand
of an “innocent” holder and made out
for S3OO.
THE WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
SORROW IN SOUTH DAKOTA.
(The Columbia State)
Who would ever have thought it of
South Dakota, the place where divorces
are neatly tailored while you wait,
the state where the degree of separa
tion hangs suspended by as thin a
hair as that which supported the sword
of Damocles? The legislature of that
state has just destroyed all precedent
by passing a law requiring twelve in
stead of six months’ residence, as here
tofore. This is striking a blow at the
very vitals of the get-divorced-quick
industry.
The new law prescribes a year’s res
idence in the state, .and a three months’
residence in the county in which the
action is brought. No divorce suits
can be tried other than at the regular
terms of court, thus doing away with
special terms of court brought about
by financial influence. This new law
does not apply to plaintiffs who were
married in that state and have lived
there since. The adoption will leave
Idaho, Nebraska, and Nevada the on
ly states in the union in which but
six months’ residence is required for
outsiders.
The new Dakota statute is not yet
an assured fact, for it has been sub
mitted to a referendum.
But woe to Sioux Falls, sorrow for
Yankton, grief for Bismarck, and tears
for Fargo when the law becomes op
erative. The bars will lose business
the hotels ’will discharge half their
help, the fashions from the east will
slow down, the livery stables will
suffer, and the water in the Turkish
baths w r ill dry up.

DESECRATING THE FLAG.
(The Western Advocate.)
Two liquor dealers of Omaha were
prosecuted under the laws of Nebras
ka on the charge of selling beer bot
tles decorated with the national col
ors. They were fined SSO each, tnit
appealed to the state supreme court on
the alleged ground of the unconstitu
tionality of the law. That court sus
tained the verdict, and the case was
carried to the supreme court of the
United States, which has just confirm
ed the previous two decisions. In the
course of his opinion, Justice Harlan
upheld strongly the right of the state
to protect the flag, the emblem of the
nation’s power, against indignities. He
maintained that the use of the flag
as an advertisement on beer bottles
cheapens and degrades it. To prohibit
such use is no abridgment of persona
rights as contemplated under the con
stitution.
