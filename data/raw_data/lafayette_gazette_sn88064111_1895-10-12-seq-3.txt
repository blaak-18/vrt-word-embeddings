A Clever Capture.
The capture of Homer Borell,
the young cattle thief from Iberia
parish, was quite clever on the part
of Sheriff Broussard Borell lad i
changed clothes and did not look :
at all like the man who had sold th
cattle to Messrs. Otto and Castel.
The sheriff located him in one of
the houses in the tenderloin district
of Lafayette and placed hi .. under ,
arrest. He at first denied all con
nection with the theft and gave a
ver) plausiole account of himself,
but when the sheriff found $60 un- i
der his hat-band he felt sure that he I
had the right m=n. The pl isoner '
was soon identified and ,he proper
affidavit was made against him.
He had sold ten head of ca tie
to Mr. Castel a d eight to Mr.
Otto. He expressed his willingness
to sell some more cattle to Mr.
Coastel, but it is not belived that
he will do any live-stock business
for some time as his chances are
excellent for an enforced service to
t e State.

District Court.
Last Mondav was the first day of
the regular October term of the dis
trict court. The following names
were drawn and the grand I
jury was empannelled: Harrison
Theall, Sidney McFadden, Aurelien
Olivier, Henry Foutrnet, S. J. M nt-t
gomery, Hugh Wagner, Antheol
Bernard. Numa Breaux, Cleobule
Doucet, Jno O. Mouton, A. A.
Labbe, Adilon Blanchet, Martini
Begnaud, A. A. Morgan, Hugh
H:utchison, J. A. Labbe. Mr.
Theall was made foreman. The
grand jury immediately entered up
on the discharge of its duties. With
the valuable services of District
Attorney Gordy. the diligince of
Sheriff Broussard and his deputies,
and of Clerk of Court Bailey, and
his capable deputy, Creighton
I Wallis, the grand inquisitors were
- enabled to do much work in a com
paratively short time. The final
: report was made Wednesday; sev
enteen true bills and five
I "no tr ie bills" were returned. As
I the report is rather lengthy we will
' give it to our readers in a somewhat
abbreviated form.
A deserved compliment was paid
iJudge Allen for his able and com
prehensive charge. The thanks ( f
the body were also tendered to
District Attorney 3ordy for able
I and conscientious assistance.
Of the jail the jury says: "We
visited the jail of the parish and
find it in very bad order, though
not through the f ult of our able
and active sheriff, but from the fol
lowing causes to-wit: The pipes
leading from the water closet of the
jail building are entirely stopped
up; and will not let off the drainage
'from said institution, which caun-s
more or less stench. Having been
given full access for investigation
by your courteous sheriff, Isaac A.
Broussard, we find the prisoners as
well fed, as well treated and as well
cared for, as could be expected un
der the present circumstances.
The Superintendent of Schools
made a verbal report to the effect:
That the schools of tihe parish are
much better attended than ever be
fore, the parents and people gener
ally taking a much deeper interest
in the cause of public education as
'is evidenced by the number of
scholars in attendance upon the
'daily sessions of the different schools
in the parish. The High School
does not appear to be as well at
tended at present as it was last ses
sion, and we would especially call
the attentaonr of tae School Board
to this fact and -ask them to inquire
into its cause.
The books of Parish Treasurer,
Wm. Clegg, were found to be well 1
kept and correct. The sum of
$69.5o is reported to the credit of
the parish and $8x 49 to the credit
of the school fund.
The grand jury reports tiat as a
rule toe roads are good. Their bad
condition in some places is due, not
to derelict overseers and citizens,
but to toe vast area over which eachl
overseer has to supervis :. Tue ap
puinttnent of tuiree to five overseersj
in each district is offered as a rein
edy, and the attention of toe Police
Jury is called to this proposition.
rhe clerk's office wa' visitel and

The sheriff's office was also visi

death unexpected, but she obeyed
the summons with fortitude and
died calmly, trusting in Christ.
She said to her husband that she
had committed all to God and was
ready to meet her Sivior. She has
left a deeply afflicted husband, five
