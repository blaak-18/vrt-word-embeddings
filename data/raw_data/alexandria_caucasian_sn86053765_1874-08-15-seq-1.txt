We envy not. the princely man,
In city or in town,
Who wonders whether pumpkin vines

We care not. for Iiis marble halls.
Nor yet his heaps of gold,
Wc would not own Iiis sordid heart
For all Iiis wealth tliriec toid.
We are the favored one of earth,
Wc breathe pure air each morn,
We sow—we reap the golden grain—
We gather in the corn ;
We toil—we live on what we earn,
And more than this we do—
We hear of starving millions rouud.
Aud gladly feed them too.
The lawyer lives on princely fees,
Yet drags a weary life.
He never knows a peaceful hour—
His atmosphere is stife.
The merchant thumbs his yardstick o'er
Grows ragged at his toil—
He's not the mail God meant him for
Why don't you till the soil I

And stamps it on our daily sheet,
To cheer the fanner's hearth.
We sing the honor of the plow.
And honor to the press.
Two noble instruments of toil,
With each a power to bless.

True wealth of human kind—

Southern Politics.
From the Chicago Times.
The newspapers which are still
busy in suppressing the rebellion
and abolishing slavery are in ecsta
cies over the W T hite Leagues of the
South. They use it as the old gen
tleman with a story about a guu
used his foot. He would stamp ou
the floor, start up, and say: "Eh,
eh, what's that ?—a gun Î Well,
speaking of guns reminds me," etc.
So the truly loyal editor writes
"White League," looks at it, and
shrieks in print : "White League !
Ali, traitors. Here, help ! Save
the Republic ! Stuft" the ballot
boxes again, back up the carpet
baggers, hel|» the rogues, help them
or that dreadful, disloyal League
will destroy the Union, the blood
sealed greenback, aud the ransom
ed colored brother, by actually es
tablishing honest governments in
the South !" It is a frightful pros
pect. The shrieking journalists
.sketch it again aud agaiu. Ihe
raw-head-and-bloody-liones story
has afeatful fascination to them
They are half-persuaded - that they
believe what they write.
We have already condemned the
idea of the W hite League. Race
should be the last consideration in
polities. Moreover, the whites are
not strong enough in the worst gov
erned States to right their wrongs
alone. But we protest against the
doctrine so industriously taught
that these Leagues have been form
ed with malice prepense, without
provocation, for the sake of mal
treating the negroes, and of doing
by bullets what ballots cannot ac
complish. The fact is, that the
white Southerners have borne in
sult and outrage long and patient
ly. Mutatis mutandis, Chicago,
would have long since been in re
volt had she had New Orleans fate.
The whites have seen unutterable
corruption among their rulers, and
have been howled down when they
feebly protested. They have seen
sworn election retnrnschanged from
hour to hour, to meet the news of
opposition gains in outlying parts
of the State. They have seen a
drunken Judge, backed by bayo
nets, put iuto power a Governor
■ffùom all America knows was nev
er elected. Negro insolence has
grown with white subjection. The
defeat of the civil rights bill, at
W asUington, was followed by a
storm of vituperation by Southern
blacks aud their allies against
Southern whites. Davenport, the
colored Chancery Clerk of Vicks
burg county, made a speech to a
negro audience which loudly cheer
ed his passionate declaration that
the white race must yield to the
coming man, the negro. He named
the daughters of the first white fam
ilies of the city, aud coarsely pre
dicted their future marri.igc with
men of his race. Similar speeches
have been made in the Mississippi
Legislature. T. W. Cardozo, Miss
ississippi State Superintendent of
Education, a colored carpet-bagger
from South Carolina, publishes in
Fred Douglass' Era the statement
that it is "better that the whole
State of Tennessee should be re
duced to ashes" than that the civil
rights bill should fail. Such vio
lent language has been the rule.—
It is but natural that the whites—
thus attacked by the blacks, should
accept the issue forced upon them.
The whole trouble in Vicksburg, ou
account of which Gov. Davis has
asked for a garrison of United
States troops, was the work of the
colored population. At least it
seems so. After due allowance has
been made for the exaggeration of
both sides, the true story is appar
ently about as follows : The city—
with a valuation of $0,000,0(10, owes
$1,000,000, Taxation is enormous,
and business is crushed under it.—
Last mouth, the negroes nominated
a city ticket. Ten of the thirteen
nominees are black. The white man
projiosed for mayor is under indict
ment for petjury and blackmailing
A ticket of white men was at once
proposed. Then Davenport made
t he speech already referred to. The
c ty was iu commotion over it, but
there was no rioting. The negro
militia patrolled the streets aud ar
rested all the whites they could
catch. Then, and not till then, did
the whites organize. Their patrols
are acting with the police. It is
predicted that the election of Aug.
4th will be quiet, and that not
twenty white men will vote the ne
gro ticket. When such conditions
exists, a "White League," or some
thing like it, is the ^tttost inevita
ble result. Yet it would have been
wiser for the whites to have nomi
uated a ticket composed of men of
both races. They cannot crush dis
honesty alone. They have not
enough votes. Let them make
common cause with the colored
men who have wit enough to see
the abyss into which the negro-rid
den States are plunging. But if
such mcu are not to be fouud, if the
honest negroes prefer to cling to
their race rather than to their
characters, then the whole South
may be forced into the attitude of
the Mobile Register, when it says
The people of Alabama have
been resisting this issue for years,
and now they have to decide be
tween thrashing the negro party at
the polls and seizing the reins of
government, or sinking into the do
mestic hell of South Carolina and
Louisiana. Mutatis mutandis , we
apprehend that New York and
Massachusetts would not stop a
huudredth part of a minute to de
bate the questiou.

An Apt Sunday School Scholar.
The following story, though not
new, has sufficient points and hu
mor to merit its publication at least
once a year :
Some roguish bhys in a town
pear the capital of New Hamp
shire, persuaded Jos. Jasper, or,
as he was generally called Joe, to
attend Sabbath school.
Joe was an overgrown, halfwit
ted. profane lad, and the boys an
ticipated fun; l»ut the various
questions propounded to him were
so readily aud correctly answered
that no one could for a moment
suppose that he was not versed in
theological lore.
Joe was duly ushered in and
placed upon a settee iu front of
one on which his friends were seat
ed, aud the examination commenced.
The teachers first questioned the
class on their regular lessons and
then turned toward Joe.
" My friends, who made the
world we inhabit ?"
Just as ho was probably about
to answer the question, one of the
boy's seated behind him inserted a
pin into his fJoe'sJ pants, about
nine inches below the ornamental
buttons ou his coat.
"God Almighty!" answered Joe
at the same time rising to his feet.
' That is correct,' answered the
teacher, " But it is not. necessary
that you should rise in answering;
a sittiug posture will do just as
well."
Joe was seated, and the cate
chism proceeded.
Who «lied, to save the world V
The pin was again inserted.
'Jesus Christ !' in a louder tone
than before, again rising to his feet.
'That is correct, but do not mani
fest so much feefing; do be a little
more reserved iu your manners,'
said the teacher, iuan expostulat
in g .one ot voice,
After Joe had calmed down ex
amination went on.
'What will be the final doom of
all wicked men P was the subject
now up for consideration, aud as
the piu was again stuek in, Joe
thundered out with a still higher
elevation of body :
'Hell and damnation !'
'My fiieud, you give the answers
to all the questions conectly, but
while you are here we wish you to
be a little more mihi in your words.
Do if you can, retrain your enthu
siasm, and give a less extended
scope to your feelings."
A young couple were out on
a door step one night lately, look
ing at the comet then visible in tin
in the Northern heavens. At leas!
it was evident the young lady want
ed to see, because she was over
heard to tell the young gent to
"keep his face out of the way so she
could see the comet !'' Then there
was a noise like the sudden draw
ing of a horse's hoof out of the stiff'
mud, and then—and then —well,
the old man thrust his head out of
the front door of that house, aud
the young astronomers turned their
backs to each other, and began
counting the stars aloud with great
vehemence. The old man told them
that the spherodial mass which they
had been so diligently contemplat
ing on the ethereal dome scarcely
demanded any more ot their united
attention that evening, and the
young man would very much ob
lige hitn by peregrinating irt the
direction of his own local habita
tion at that immediate period of
time, or he would enable him to see
stars with more multitudinosity.

Unexpected Wisdom.
How shall a woman festen her
stockings so as not to interfere wftb
the blood, or spoil the shape of the
le —let ns see—ot the honiqui mally
pense. After the' most, careful re
search as far as our limited facili
ties would allow, we arise from our
humble explorations, and teuder
the following suggestions:
Wear them short, and let the
tops bubble out of the shoo in the
form of lace, a la beer mug.
If you have 'em long, put inucil
age inside and stick 'eiu to you.
Have them long enough to tie
about the waist aud use the top
pauier.
Edge the top with steel and tas
ten a loadstone to your corset.
Fasten a strap to each stocking,
extend them gracefully np each
side of the body and attach with
blue ribbons to the ear riugs.
Fasten them to a nail and go
barefooted.
Attach a small balloon to each
stocking.
Make them out of material that
will draw up.
If you are thirty five and unmar
ried, make a hole near the top of
each stocking and button it to your
kix-e cap.
These are all the methods that
suggest themselves to us at present,
und of the number some one or
more may be deemed worthy of
adoption. We have taken a sud

needed reform is brought about.—

Tompkins' Boy.
A LITTLE ARGUMENT HE IIAD WITH
BROWN.
Tompkins' boy raised his hands
to Heaven and swore revenge, none
of your common revenge; but the
regular, dime novel sort. This is
how
how it all happened :
Tompkins' boy had scalped
Brown's cat, aud wore the feline
trophy in triumph iu his belt. He
had been reading fractional curren
cy literature, and this was the re
sult. Last week he was a pirate—
aud hung thirteen cats to the yard
ami. This week he began his ca
reer as an Indian scout by cutting
up his father's perforated buckskin
underclothes for on Indian suit—
trimmi:.g it with beads from his
mother's velvet cloak, while her
new bonnet was demolished to se
cure the ostrich feathers for his
headdress.
This was a perilous week for the
children of the neighborhood, if a
boy, unguarded by his father, veil
tured out, Tompkins' boy* skulking
behind some tree, whizzed au ar
row at his head; while dogs were
mercilessly treated as wolves, and
cats were panthers. It is astonish
ing how lively a boy of an aspiring
mind can make a neighborhood.—
But all these noble aspirations were
lost upon Browu ; he was a man
who read the Bible and taught a
class iu the Sunday school ; aud
how could he be expected to appre
ciate the romantic sentiments of a
dime novel.
Brown was stauding at his wood
pile the other evening at sundown,
when he was startled by a war
hoop on the other side, and there
was Tompkins* boy in Indinn suit
and red paint, drawing a bead with
bow and arrow on his fine Brahma
rooster; and just as the chicken
flopped over Browu got around on
the other side and got Tompkins'
boy by the ear. Now, Brown was
not a man to pull a boy's hair all
out and jawhawk him around ; be
possessed | reut patience, and bo
just quietly lifted Tompkins' boy by
that ear and stood him on the end
of his toes, while that ear stretched
out like a piecg of India rubber
that had been warmed in the fire—,
and he talked with him quietly
abont his depravity, pleaded with
hiin to abandon his bloodthirsty
life and let his ambition in tnture
years lead hiin to the honest walks
of politics. Brown then ohanged
off and took a fresh lift on the ear
with his left hand, while he drew
out a Bible from his pocket and
read the Sermon on the Mount to
Tompkins' boy. This reading did
not interest Tompkins' boy, his at
tention was more particularly
drawn to the nicety with which he
was balanced on the toes by the aid
of his ear; but the uiost pleasant
things grow tiresome at least, and
the novelty of his position wearing
off, he said he had to go home, bis
supper was ready, and his mother
nanted hiin to pick up some chips
for her; so Brown gave him a cate
chism and some tracts, and let bim
down slowly, so the effect would
not be too sudden on him, and, as
Tompkins' boy went home that ear
stood up in the moonlight like a
finger board at the cross road, and
ohl Tompkins bad to hang a two
pound weight on it to draw it down
to its place.
That night Tompkius' boy,,walk
ed the floor and swore revenge.
Dad blast the Brown's, he'd murder
them all, and hang their scalps on
the garden fence to dry ! Yes, he'd
kill his baby, too, it had no busi
ness being a Brown.
The next evening, as Brown came
home in the moonlight, he felt a
dull thud mid a sharp pain in the
calf of his leg, and stooping down,
lie pulled out a sharpspike nail tied
to the end of a stick, aud when ho
straightened tip he was under the
necessity ot pulling another ont of
back and arms, while two of them
went through his new silk hat. Ho
did not know what it meant until
he saw that they were arrows, and
then the way he went for that Tom
kius boy was 1 vely. After a long
search he found him in the feuce
corner, und fun began. Fortunate
ly, Brown had a little rattan cane
with him. He took Tompkins' boy
by the nap of his neck and the seat
ot his pants and laid him across the
top tail ot that fence, and as every
whack caine down Tompkins' boy
jumped sixteen inches high
Brown's dander was up, and it was
the hottest engagement Tompkins'
boy was ever in, and made him so
sore he'll have to go down some
other way for the next week. Brown
took all those noble aspirations out
of him. But now he will never be
lit for anything but, a Street Com
missioner, and Brown had to tie oti
nine pounds of fat bacon to save
himself from the lock jaw.
A wag, one evening, pulled down
a turner's sign, and put it up over
a lawyer's door ; iu the morning it
read: "All sorts of turning aud
twisting done here."
