wnilth to alleviute t)e mnost awful, solf
rowful fate which can befall a human
being, that of dying through years of
slow torture by leprosy.
Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Weiss, a ilevoted
young married pair. refined. hi.hly ed

htirts to know they ha-n; nOt. meal.s

doomed ones.
Their chief want is for more build
ings, a surgery and bathrooms. The
lepers of the colony live in two groups
of cottages. the women in one group,
men in the other. They are kept very
clean, being bathed and having their
ulcers dressed daily. The abler and
more capable of the victims help in
this wok,. knowing full well it is only
a question of a little time when they.
too, will become helpless as the weak

leprosy.. It may attack a person at
any age, from two years up. Its dura
tion reaches sometimes thirty years be

In about t1o years. No case is on rec

remedy known among some of the
Surinam negroes which seems to et
feet a cure, but sooner or later the dis
ease apjlars again. Even if relief If
anly temporary, medical science ought
to petsist till it finds out what the rem-.

Among the natives of the original In

never seen. It is, however' darkly
hinted that now and then there is such,
but he is put out of life Immediately
