TWILIGHT’S
THINKLINGS
(Continued from page 1)
wherein I was written down as an
‘"intolerant beast,” an “advocate of
■arrow Americanism,” an “apostle of
persecution.” a “dangerous preacher
of restriction.” Many foreign •lan*
gunge papers devoted much space to
my contentions attempting answers
for the “fool professor’s considera
tion.” Nevertheless I still consider
the magazines and newspapers of
this country printed in foreign lan
guages dangerous. And I will con
tinue to think as I' do until every
«uch publication Is compelled to
print beside avery column In a for
eign language an aceurute English
translation.
The 14.000,00 foreign-born people In
this country are supporting 1052 pa
pers In 30 different languages vary
ing from Uerman to Hebrew, from
Italian to Chinese. How many for
eign language papers presented to
their readers the wisdom of restrict
ive and selective immigration luws!
In one chorus sang the foreign pub-
Mentions arousing the various nation
alities to which they appeal ugalnst
the Johnson Immigration bill. The
.foreign language dulltes, weeklies and
monthlies foster allen-mindedness
and thwart u general acceptance of
the English language and American
Ideals and traditions. Only a thor
ough assimilation of our many raclul
groups can keep this coutnry a uulted
whole. Foreign publications empha
size race and nationality conscious
ness and so work contrary to the best
Interests of America Directly In
this connection, Gin© Speranza states
In The World’s Work:
“The closer the likeness of mind
■mi character of Its people, the bet
ter will the American democracy
function. The converse Is equally
true. That Is the greater the diver
gences and differences from the his
toric, homogenlety of the American
people, the greater the strain upon
American civilization. It Is when the
American people ure forced to resist
the operation and effects of such vari
ations as they bear down more and
more heavily upon the life, culture,
and ideals of America, thut they be
come aware of their grave Internal
problems”
Look at the proposition from any
.angle you may, It certainly becomes
.obvious that the language press serves
as an antidote to Americanization.
Behold the true situation—aliens
■re alienlzing America.

(Continued from page 1)
versations and arguments that took
place between himself and officers
of the Klan about acts of violence
that had taken place in Texas. The
witness was fair enough t<i Dr. Evans
to say that Dr. Evans, now Imperial
Wizard o.f the order, had told him in
the presence of other officers lhat it
was his purpose to stop all acts of
violence so far as the Klan participa
tion was concerned. Clark asserted
that other Klan officers in the confer
ence which took place in Houston
scoffed at Evans’ statement. A Klo
kan committee in each lodge, witness
said, supervised reports of cases of
misconduct, considered prospects of
disorders and set spies on suspected
individuals, even putting their tele
phone and telegraph communications
under surveillance. Judge Clark al
so said that in his opinion 90 per cent
of the membership of the Klan did
not know of or participate in any
way as an organization in acts of
violence. He also stated that some
of the very best people in Texas be
longed to the Klan and stood very
high in their respective communities.
The main thing brought out on
cross examination of Judge Clark by
the Mayfield attorneys was that he
waa being paid at the rate of $15,000
a year for his services as general
counsel for the realm of Texas. That
he considered himself a good Ameri
can citizen all the time he was a mem
ber of the Klan and an officer of the
organization. It was after he was cut
off the payroll that he resigned be
cause as he contended that he could
no longer remain a good citizen of
his country and continue to be a
Klansman. Yet he admitted on the
stand that the Klan was much better
when he resigned than when he went
in, that the Klan had greatly Im
proved and that the morale was
much higher among the members and
officers under the Evans regime than
it had been before Dr. Evans was ele
vated to his high office.
James P. Straughan, oil man of
Fort Worth, testified that he had
spent SISOO of his own money trav
eling around over Texas helping in
campaign work not only for Senator
Mayfield but also for state and coun
ty officers as well. He also solicited
and collected $260 from the Fred B.
Foster Oil company. S2OO from a man
by the name of Hoffer, $250 from
Slay, Simon and Smith, dealers in
oil leases, land and real estate, and
$125 from a law firm in Fort Worth,
lie admitted collecting all told about
$625 besides his own money and
spending all of it in the campaign
without the knowledge or consent of
Senator Mayfield. He said it was
common practice for men in Texas
to go out and raise money and spend
it without even referring the matter
to any candidate or campaign man
ager. He was so positive that he
never gave Senator Mayfield any
money that he did not even send or
give a cent of his contributions to
iViaytieid’s campaign manager.
Grabbing at everything as a drown
ing man grabs a straw, Mr. Peddy’s
attorneys have taken the unusual
stand before the subcommittee that
the Ku Klux Klan is an illegal, un
lawful, criminal organization and
that membership in such an organi
zation disqualifies everyone from
holding public office, therefore that
Senator Mayfield should be ousted
from his seat in the senate. The at
torney making that bold claim ad
mits to the committee that he him

self has been a Klansman. This stand
is undoubtedly the beginning of the
collapse of the Peddy case against
Mayfield, as it is apparent that none
of the committee agrees with that
position.
W. H. Gray, president of the Na
tional Independent Oil Producers As
sociation. with headquarters at Tul
sa. Oklahoma, formerly from Texas
with an office in Houston, said that
he had known Senator Mayfield from
infancy, that he had seen him in
the Texas campaign of 1922. He said
he had nothing to do with the .Vay
field headquarters at Dallas except
that he had gone to the hotel there
and guaranteed the payment of the
headquarters foi the Dallas County
Mayfield club, which was behind in
its rent. Mr. Gray said he had stood
good for the payment of about SISOO
but that later on the club raised the
money and paid for the headquarters
and that the hotel had never called
on him for one cent of his personal
guarantee.
J. L. Hunter, a cotton broker of
Austin. Texas, who had known Mr.
Mayfield since the latter went to the
state legislature, told of collecting
money and spending it in the May
field campaign without the knowl
edge or consent of Senator Mayfield
or the Mayfield campaign manager.
He told of receiving from John C.
Towns altogether something like
$2,000 or $2,500, which was in two or
three different checks. He collected
another SIOO or S2OO, but he thought
the latter sum correct, from W. T.
Eldridge in the sugar business. He
got $250 from Tom Hunter, of Wich
ita Falls, SSOO from George Beggs,
$l5O from Reese Allen, and $l5O from
a Mr. Bonner, of Houston.
Mr. Hunter said he was in Austin
frequently during the 1922 campaign.
He exhibited a copy of the Ferguson
circular w’hich he had printed and
circulated about 500,000; he also toli
of having printed and circulating
about the same number of what he
called a Mexican circular; and an
other Ferguson circular about Fer
guson’s Democratic record, about the
same number. He estimated that the
circulars and printing, envelopes,
mailing, etc., cost him about $2,000.
He also told of paying for advertis
ing in newspapers and of hiring three
university students to go out on
speaking trips over the state, he pay
ing all their expenses. Mr. Hunter
estimated that he had collected and
spent anywhere from $4,000 to $5,000
in the Mayfield campaign of his own
volition and that the senator did not
know about it. He knew that Hun
ter was helping in his campaign but
had no knowledge of the money mat
ters. He said the only money he ever
gave Senator Mayfield himself was a
personal contribution of $320 at one
time and possibly $75 from another
individual at another time.
Mr. Hunter said he had traveled ex
tensively over the entire state during
the campaign but not altogether in
the interest of Senator Mayfield. He
had an extensive business buying mu
nicipal bonds, and worked that busi
ness along with state politics.
On cross examination Mr. Hunter
told of raising and spending money
in the gubernatorial campaign in be
half of Mr. Hubby, that it was cus
tomary in Texas for men of all par
ties to raise money and spend it re
gardless of the candidate or his cam
paign manager. He said he never
told Senator Mayfield one word about
the money he raised and spent in his
behalf except the $320 and $75 that
he handed nim personally.
Mr. Hunter in talking of the Ku
Klux Klan connection with the May
field campaign told of John C. Towns
George Begg9 and Tom Hunter, all of
whom contributed, being opponents
of the Klan in Texas. He said Towns
and Boggs were terribly bitter at
the Klan and that Tom Hunter was
positively vicious in his attitude
against the Klan. He also testified
that he did not know of a single
Klansman in Texas who gave more
than $5 to the Mayfield campaign
He also said that John C. Towns told
hi mthat the railroad men and the
oil men were opposed to Mayfield in
the campaign. He said that Senator
Mayfield did not know anything
about the Ferguson circular until the
campaign was almost over.
J. E. McQuinn, of Atlanta, Georgia,
auditor and assistant cashier of the
Ku Klux Klan organization, testified
that he audited the books of the Klan
organization from the beginning of
the Klan and through the years 1922
and 1923. He had with him the cash
ier’s journal for the entire year of
1922, showing all receipts and dis
bursements and also a book of week
ly statements which had been submit
ted to the finance committee con
sisting of Dr. H. C. Montgomery, Fred
Savage and N. M. Furney, weekly,
during the year 1922. This commit
tee had submitted a complete report
at the November, 1922, hlonklave at
Atlanta.
It was agreed that the attorneys
for both sides would run over the
books and statements with Mr. Mc-
Quinn in private session to see if
they can find anything bearing on
the Mavfield campaign in 1922. and
the subcommittee adjourned until
Friday morning. May 16, at ten
o’clock.

METOODISI CRY
Strife in Self-Defense Faili
to Get Approval of
Committee.
Springfield, Musa.—By a vore of 76
to 37, the church and state committee
of the Methodist Episcopal General
conference decided to recommend that
the Methodist church as an organiza
tion should refuse to participate In
any further wars.
The decision embraces not only wars
of aggression, hut wars of defense. If
the recommendation is carried out. the
church will disown war and merely
will elevate its eyebrows a degree or
tw’o when a hostile navy steams up to
the const und trains Its guns on New
York or San Francisco.
No Exceptions.
An amendment was Introduced to
make an exception In case of defen
sive wars, but It was tabled.
The resolution follows:
“The hour has struck for the church
to take positive and practical steps to
end war. The peoples of the world
ore appealing to the church, as the or
ganized expression of Christ’s way of
life, to lead the wny. Methodism, a
world church dedicated to world serv
ice, has extraordinary opportunity and
obligation In this crlrts.
Answers Challenge.
“Facing this challenge and answer
ing this appeal, the Methodist Episco
pal church declares for the right and
responsibility of the church to utter
moral Judgment concerning the nature
of war; for the freedom of the Indi
vidual member of the church to follow
the dictates of his own conscience
whether, as an Individual, he can sup
port or engage in war; for the Inaugu
ration of nn educational campaign
which shnll seek to reveal to all our
people the nature, causes and conse
quences of war and Its relation to the
Christian Ideal of the kingdom of God;
for the removal of the causes of war.

BURSUM BILL VETO
UPHELD BY SENATE
Washington. President Coolldge’s
veto of the Rursuni old soldiers* pen
sion bill, the first of a series of vetoes
expected to feature the wind-up of this
session of congress, was sustained In
the senate by a hair’s breadth —only
one vote to spare.
And with administration Repub-
licans numerously voting against him
and southern Demnerats conspicuously
voting to support him, the President
was saved from a rebuff only by ex
ercise of considerable Ingenuity nnd
some legerdemain In the calling of the
roll, the result being accomplished
finally by Senator Harreld (Rep.,
Okla.) switching his vote from one
side to the other.
Senator Bursum, after the senate
action. Introduced n new bill with the
rntes slightly changed from the origi
nal. and costing about $5,000,000 a year
less. He declnred he would press It
nnd not abandon the fight. However,
It Is generally considered that the ef
fect of the vote in the senate Is to kill
the measure for this session nnd prob
ably for this congress.
According to the estimated cost of
the measure In the President’s mes
sage, It would have taken $58,000,000
out of the treasury. The estimate of
Senator Bursum ns to the cost, how
ever, was much less.

bosses. Therte. perhaps, isn’t a city
in the United States that needs a
baptism of Americanism more than
the Capitol City of Minnesota. The
man in St. Paul politics runs against
a powerful political ring regardless
of what way he turns. As things,
|)olitically, stand today in this city
no man can get very far unless the
O’Connor gang accepts him. Gang
politics has no place in any Ameri
can community. The Ku Klux Klan
will rid St. Paul of all political
bosses.
The Protestant order has a hard
task ahead, but nevertheless, it will
do that which many insist is impos
sible Already the Klan member
ship here is strong and growing by
leaps and bounds.
Protestantism has been a helpless
majority too long in St. Paul and it
is just about time that many who
want this city to be the best kind
of place in which to live, realize and
appreciate duties of citizenship.
There is only one salvation lor the
Capitol City and that is the Ku
