THEODORE ROOSEVELT
AVOWED ASPIRANT FOR PRESI
DENTIAL NOMINATION.
Expects to Win With the Support of the
!North-Will Not Accept if His
Majority Is from the South.
A special of recent date from Wash
ington, D. C., to the New York Mail
and Express says:
President Roosevelt does not desire
the nomination for .the next presidency
if that nomination can be won in the
Republican national convention of 1904
only by the votes of delegates from the
Southern States.
The President is an avowed aspirant
for the nomination, but he is ambitious
that it shall come to him from the repre
sentatives of the Republican party,
chosen by the free electors in the states
where its voters are in the majority,
or where they have a fair possibility of
winning the election. He does not wish
the verdict of the convention to be de
termined by delegates representing
merely the skeleton of an organization
in States where Republican citizens are
either hopelessly in the minority or are
disfranchised by the who!esale, or can
not command an honest count of their
ballots.
While no person can be quoted, it can
be stated that this declaration, here an
nounced publicly for the first time, is
made upon high authority. It will be
contradicted by no man in the political
or personal- confidence of the President.
It is a series of incidents, most of
them occurring in the South, that has
made it seem advisable to some of the
closest -counselors of the President to
make known thus definitely his attitude
toward the nomination. His ambition to
receive the nomination is natural and
has become a recognized fact.

LAST OF THE SIGNElRS
A Delegate to the Secession Convention
of 186o Passes Away. 4
Baton Rouge Truth, Feb. 28: Mr. Au
gustus Talbot, an old resident of the
town of Plaquemine, died on Friday last
at the age of 89 years. He was, as the
Iberville South says, the last of the sur
vivors of those who signed the secession
ordinance in i86o, anid for so doing was
the victim of hatred on the part of car
pet baggers during reconstruction days.
Until the last few years he took great
interest in public aaffirs and filled many
of the most important positions in his
parish and State.
He came to the bar in 1835, and was
appointed district attorney by Governor
Isaac Johnson. This position he re
signed. In 1852 he was a member of the
consttutional convention that framed the
constitution of that year. In 1852 he was
elected a member of the State Senate,
an' served with distinction during the
four-year term. tie was a delegate from
Louisiana to the celebrated Democratic
convention that assembled at Charleston,
S. C., in i86o, which led to a division of
the party on the- slavery- question. He
was a delegate to the secession conven
tion in r86o, and at intervals presided
over that body. He also served as presi
dent for four years of the school board
under 4the administration of Governor
MoEnery, and his interest in public edu
cation is attested today by several hand
some school houses he had erected.
At the bar he stood upon the highest
round of the ladder. His was an exalted
character, and in this community no one
commanded more profound respect.

Johna Dorden is no more. He was

POPE LEO XllI
Silver Jubilee Celebrated With Grc:et
Solemnity-Splendid Topaz for
the Pope.
Rome, March 3.Aside from the golden
tiara, the most magnificent gift received
by the Pope today on the occasion of hIs
jubilee is a wonderful topaz, a prscnt
from the citizens of Naples. The st,'ne
is the largest of its kind in the world.
It weighs I kilo 784 grams. It was found
in the Graes mines in Brazil, and be
longed to the Bourbons of Naples, from
whom it passed into the Cariello family
of Naples. The face of the stone Iears
an engraving of "Ibrist Breaking the
Eucharistic Bread."
NEW YORK OBSERVES JUBILEE.
New York, March 3.-One of the
most elaborate ecclesiastical ceremonies
ever seen in Neew York was held today
in St. Patrick's' Cathedral, the occasion
being a celebration of the Pope's jfibilee.
The participants included all of the
bishops of the ecclesiastical province of
New York clad in their gorgeous robes
of office, together with all the clergy of
the diocese. Archbishop Falconio, the
Apostolic Delegate at Washington, cele
brated Pontifical Mass and Archbishop
Farley preached the sermon. The feat
ure of the elaborate musical program
was Gounod's "Messe Solenelle" for
soli, chorus, orchestra and organ. The
cathedral, spacious though it is, was to
tally unable to accommodate the thous
ands who sought admission.
LEO'S GOLDEN JUBILEE AS CAR
DINAL
As indicated by the record Pope Leo's
silver jubilee of papacy (elected Pope
February 20, 1878), was more than that.
it wag alsr his golden jubilee as Cardinal
(proclaimed by Pius IX in the consis
tory of Deceniber I9, i853), anid. fiis dia
mond jubilee of episcopacy (preconized
archbishop. i Damietta by Gregory XVI
on January, Is, k84, and consecrated
February- zg). Stch a triple jubilee his
holiness hfas lived to ceebiatet- iHe is

FUL RIVERS
Elc-vy Rains Ha~e, Caused Floods in
General.
Full rivers, rising beyond their banks
:nd covering thousands of acres, are the
reporfs from Pensylvania, Ohio, Texas
ind the states on the Mississippi below
the Ohib. And'-with these floods come
the pitiful recital of families abandoning
their homes for high-land and leaving to
waste their accumulations of years of
toil and industry.
In this section the people residing in
bte Red river valley must contend with
:e foiods whichl are carried from the
fst territory drained into the red river
r~d to this may be added smaller
dtreams, of which Sulphur river .is all
iiportant.

EACH FACTION WINS
For the Ficst Time in F Fur V:.ar !
That State Fully itji:re<t. di
in the Upper IPrnch of
National Legislature.
Dover, Del., March 4.-Fcr the firol
time in four years the state of Dole.
ware Monday secured full representa
tion in the United States senate. A'
a special session the statd iegislaturl
elected State Senator J. Frank Ailet
(Union Republican) to the senatorshic
which expires in 1907, and Conge.'ss
man Theisler Bail (Regular Repusli.
can) to the term expiring in 1905.
The selection was unioubtedly due
to pressure from Washington brought
to bear upon the regular Republicans
in the legislature who hove all alonr
been opposed to the election of J. Ed
ward Addicks or any of his adherent
to the United St.r .senate. Congress
man Dick of Ohio came to Dove: in
thee interest of Republican harmony.
He established headquarters at Hotel
Richardson, where, prior to the joint
session of the legislature he received
a delegation from each RepubliCan sac
tion. He advised the acceptance by the
regular Republicans of the Union=Re
publicans' proposal agreed tpon in
Philadelphia on Saturday, that a iUn.
ion Republican be elected to the long
term senato:ship and a regular Re
publican be elected for the short terns,
Addicks himself to be eliminated. In
this connection Mr. Dick said:
"The regulars should accept the
proposition of the Unlion Republicans.
This is the best thing to do -anr is
-wha-t the national committee want. I
am doing all I can to bring ahout this
result."
The thirty-Rfth ballot was taken at
noon and resulted in, no electiiri and
a recess was taken until 2:30 o'cock.
After the agreement between the Un
J-n and .regular Republicans hedt been
reported the Union Republican legis
lators' met in caucus and natned J.
Frank Allee as their candidate ,for
United States senator. The _Deioerats'
in caucus decided unanimously to -ote
for one regular Republican, but were
unable to agree on the proposition to
vote for two regulr Republicans. The
elect~on of Messrs. Allee and Ball was
announced to an audience that filled
the house of representatives to suffo
cation. The noise and confusion on
the part of those who came to see the
proceedings was -so great that in+ny
of the legislators became' bewildered
and apparently did not know how to
vote when the roll was called. The · p
pearance of Congressman Dick in the
hall was the signal for wild and'-ro
longed applause. Beside him sat Mf.
Addicks. The latter evinced much sat
Isfaction when the result was aiinoitmc
ed. He was the first to, cong-tttulate
Senator Allee and was foliowe4 by a
long procession of legisators aMi s dc.
.ators, all of whom were anxlbuso to
;hake the hand of the suiccessful can
didate.
The election is regarded..here .&s an
Xddicks victory because of the -refial
of the regular Republicans to ilree to
a compromise with the Democrats.
"I have only- to say," said Senator
Allee, "'that I sincerely regret ~that I
have to fill the place that belongs to
Mr. Addlcka."
