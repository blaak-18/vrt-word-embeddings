Reply to Another Socialist Letter
My Dear Sir:—l love you for the
enemies you have made, and followed
you and the Populist banner as long
as there was a single ray of hope for
success. I endorse your views on
Foreign Missions and other ques
tions, but on some things you are
wrong, my brother.
You profess to favor government
ownership of railroads, other public
utilities, but the Government owner
ship of land, as advocated by So
cialists, is an abomination in your
sight. Your land-plank starts off
thus, “The land is the heritage of
all the people, and should be held by
actual settlers only.” Who, except
the Government, will hold it for ac
tual settlers only? Certainly not the
money-changers.
Brother Watson, the fact is that
you are today a man without a party.
That little fusion deal over in St.
Louis in 1896 killed your party as
dead as “Heck”, and no man on earth
knows this fact better than yourself.
That infamous deal also killed the
Democratic party, and no leader from
W. J. Bryan down to Hoke Smith,
ever expects to see another Demo
cratic president elected.
Your able editorials against the
Steel Trust, Lumber Trust, etc., are
good and timely, but the trust which
overshadows all others today is the
Land Trust, and you are too smart a
man not to know that such is the
case. While you own thousands of
acres of land, there are thousands
of landless men in your own state
who are peoned through no fault of
their own.
Do you believe in the unlimited
owership of lands by private indi
viduals or corporations, and if so,
why? And if not, what remedy do
you propose?
You profess to believe that a man
can not have a private home on land
owned by the Government, but they
did do so in this country for more
than, a hundred years, and the great
damning mistake was made when the
title was not forever vested in the
Government and allow the family to
use it while they live in the world.
What plank in the Socialist plat
form leads you to believe that that
party, if in power, will destroy the
home, or family? If you should ad
vocate that the government build a
railroad from Atlanta to the moon,
it certainly does not commit the whole
Fopulist party to that doctrine.
Lands should never have been
bought and sold, but held by the
governments for the use of the peo
ple. Man needs considerably more
land while he lives than he does
when dead. If you drink from a pub
lic well, that becomes your own pri
vate drink of water as soon as you
have taken it. Then why, Brother
Watson, can not I have a private
home on a little strip of public do
main while I live here in the world?
You appear to me to be hammer
ing at all evils alike, without offer
ing a remedy, or without an organ
ized effort. The trusts don’t care a
“cuss how much we “cuss” them,
unless we organize and fix to “bust”
them.
Now, my dear Brother Watson, I
shall ever feel grateful to you for
the grand truths you have battled
for, but why not get out of a dead
political party and come into one
which has never fused with the ene
my and died, —one which has a fixed
purpose, and is well organized?
In conclusion, —if you will explain
your position on those questions, you
may afterwards (if you wish) carry
my little Socialistic hide over to your
big sarcastic tan-yard.
M. D. BRAND.
(Answer.)
There is no inclination to deal sar
castically, or disrespectfully, with Mr.
Brand’s letter. It tends rather to
cause a feeling of melancholy.
He alludes to the fact that the So
cialists have an organization and uses
that as an inducement for me to
“come into” it: but a Tammanyite
could say as much, the Brewers’ As
sociation could say as much, Foreign
Missions could say as much, and a
good many other organizations that
I have not joined, could offer the
same temptation.
As to w r hat has been said about
Socialism and our monogamist home,
Brother Brand must wait for the No
vember number of the Magazine. He
will therein find the proofs.
Bro. Brand’s letter is typical of the
state of mind caused by Socialism.
If one owns several thousand acres
of land, which represents the earn
ings of a life of unremitting and in
tensely energetic toil, his views of
the private ownership are not to be
considered. Wayland, however, will
buy a block in a Missouri town, take
the deeds in his daughter’s name, and
then howl about the beauties of Com
munism. And that block is more
valuable than the several thousand
acres of this Georgia land.
The readers of his Appeal never
know about Wayland’s little transac
tions in city property, but they are
faithfully reminded of the Astor es
tate, and the number of acres owned
by other “hell-hounds of capitalism”.
The “land trust!” Where is it,—
this land trust? There are unoccu
pied areas in almost every state of
the Union. The Government owns
hundreds of millions of acres, hold
ing it for “actual settlers.” Texas
begs and pleads for home-seekers:
Florida does the same. In my own
county, farms are “lying out”, for
lack of men who will till the soil;
and this is true of nearly every por
tion of Georgia.
So long as the glare and the noise
and the human interest of the cities
draw people as the candle draws the
moth, they will get scorched. If a
thousand men are hell-bent on liv
ing at the same spot, that particular
spot will gain unnatural importance
and value. If both the Trojan and
the Greek are fiercely determined
to have the same woman, Helen will
bring about the siege and sack of
Troy.
Flagler carried car-loads of unem
ployed of the Northern cities down
to Florida, and gave them work on
bis Key West railroad. They wouldn’t
stay. They got lonesome. The call
of the city was irresistible. They
all went back to their dear old slums.
They stole rides on freight trains, they
took it afoot, they would have crawled
back, —so determined were they to
return to the illuminated city, the
The Jeffersonian
roaring city, the fascinating, intoxi
cating city.
Why is this? I don’t know. I my
self, do not understand it. If you
were to offer to make me a present of
the Astor estate, on condition that I
should live in New York, I wouldn’t
have it. But if you proposed to the
poorest New Yorker to come down
here and dig a living out of some of
my land, he’d give you the horse
laugh.
Is it not plain enough how private
ownership began?
The tribe got tired of wandering
about, and settled down. The terri
tory upon which it “squatted”, was
parcelled out among the members of
the tribe, —which at first was a group
of kinspeople.
Every year a re-division was made.
After a while some fellow who
had done extra work on his allotment,
or had put up a better hovel than the
others, claimed that the same slice
should be given him again,— and his
equity in his improvements was rec
cognized by his relatives. He was
permitted to keep the same farm. He
made further improvements; and
again, his equitable right to reap
where he had sown, was recognized.
He kept the same farm. Then his
brother, or his nephew, or his cousin,
imitated his example, put extra im
provements on his allotment, and
made a similar claim for recognition
of his natural right to enjoy the re
sults of his labor.
Private ownership originated in the
industrious tribesman’s demand to
use that which he had made. It was
the family’s reward to its more pro
gressive member.
Then, when the man died, —who
had the best claim upon his home?
His widow and children, or the tribe?
The whole tribal family deliberated
in free council, and decided that the
man’s own flesh and blood were his
natural heirs. In nearly all such
cases, the wife and child had helped
the dead man do his work.
The old Brehon laws of Ireland
throw many a glimpse of light on
the patriarchal origin of property
rights. But the Socialist ignores the
simple, natural, necessary rise of
“capitalism”: its abuses, claim all of
his attention.
Is any combination of capital en
gaged in gobbling up the farms? No.
Wall Street adds railroad to railroad;
the Power Trust is out after water
rights; the Steel Trust, Copper Trust,
Oil Trust, Coal Trust never get
enough: the saw mills have been
threaded together in a dozen big As
sociations, — but where is anybody try
ing to buy up all the farm land?
A few years ago the Corbin Bank
ing Company began to lend money,
on five-year deeds. The cry went up
t’ at the capitalists of New York were
scheming to get hold of all the land.
What were the facts? The Corbin
Banking Company only took the land
when it had to; and sold it, just as
fast as possible, to whoever would
pay the sum loaned. In many cases,
they parted with the land on long
term sales to negroes and poor
whites. The Company didn’t want
the land: it wanted the money.
