THE CALL of the NORTH
I* published every Wednesday by the Call of the North Publishing Co., St. Paul, Minnesota,
and will stand for American institutions, principles, ideals and traditions without fear
or favor.
Edited, not to make up people's minds, but to shake up people’s minds; to help
mold active public opinion which will make America a proper place to live in.
News of truth kills more false news and shrivels up more “bunk” than all the earnest
arguments in the world. Truth helps to clarify opinions on serious Questions by serious
people.
THE CALL OF THE NORTH will strive to give the American viewpoint on pub

LUTHER AND THE PRES
The visit in America at this time of
so distinguished a Luther scholar as
Dr. Nathar. Soderblom, archbishop of
Uppsala, can have but one effect,
namely, to quicken the Lutheran spirit
in Lutherans themselves and to give
non-Lutherans a new interest in
Luther and the Church that bears his
name. The heroic spirit of Luther
who stood fearlessly for definite gos
pel truths and certain inalienable hu
man rights, does not in any marked
degree characterize even present day
Lutherans. The hurry-scurry life of
to-day finds little time for serious
thinking on religious and church prob
lems. We are too much preoccupied
with our business, our money-getting,
our sociahactivities and our personal
pleasures to enjoy even an undisturb
ed home life, much less to give any
serious attention to matters of re
ligion and church. In this respect
Protestantism as a whole is alike
everywhere. There is, however, this
distinction, that while the rank and
file of the Reformed churches by lib
eral contributions make it possible for
their church leaders to carry on a
vigorous campaign for their particu
lar churches, we Lutherans are too
prone to be content with our past
great memories and to let the work
of Lutheran expansion take care of
itself the best way it can. There is
not in us that heroic enthusiasm for
the truth as it is embodied in the
Lutheran Church which was in Luther
and the Lutherans of the Reformation
period. Our chief concern has not
been so much for Lutheran expansion
in America, as rather to establish
without any peradventure who are
true and genuine Lutherans.
While we have been thus preoccupi
ed, not always in the most brotherly
spirit, with questions of lesser im
portance, the Roman Church which,
as Cardinal Gibbons has said, “knows
its own mind,” has been, and is, man
ifesting great enterprise, activity, en
ergy and also vindictiveness in some
quarters. This Church is consolidat
ing its forces in the United States,
and is looking to the development of
organization. It makes a larger use
of lay workers, and is greatly
strengthening the hands of the
Knights of Columbus and the Nation
al Council of Catholic men. The
growing activities of the Knights of
Columbus (they now claim 800,000
members) comprise greatly increas
ed building projects, the establishing
in Washington of a college for the
sole purpose of training leaders for
the K. C., a strong publicity program,
and the introduction of new policies
in their religious work. With their
slogan, “America first!” they com
bine a world policy of the proudest
kind. „ t
In view of these activities of the
Roman Church in America, what is
the Church of Luther doing to retain
its position in the heart of its people
and in the life of the nation? Is it
not high time that we forget our
petty differences, that which constitu
tes but so many labels, and begin to
look in earnest to the union of our
forces that we may make our Church
the power it should be, considering

that the earth is a round globe, slight

NT DAT LUTHERANISM
the number of*its nominal adherents?
If we are to accamplish any real re
sults we must at least work together,
standing shoulder to shoulder, not in
controversy with the Church of Rome
or any other Church, but in promoting
Bible study, in insisting upon clear
and fearless preaching of the gospel
in our pulpits with Jesus Christ as the
only Savior and upon a holy life and
conduct on the part of our member
ship, and in promoting national and
world-wide Lutheran missions. Our
best answer as Lutherans to calumny
is a consistent Christian life in the
Spirit of the Master, characterized
also by earnest, fervent prayer.
As Lutherans we must do our ut
most now to safe guard the principles
of the Protestant Reformation, pro
claiming Jesus as the only Savior,
the open Bible and the universal
priesthood of all believers. We must
strive to develop a real mutual un
derstanding and a Lutheran solidar
ity. When we have accomplished this
we can began to prepare a fresh apol
ogetic of Lutheranism (and why not
of Protestantism?), in view of chang
ed conditions generally. The Roman
Church now has an International
Truth Society with headquarters on
Bergen St., Brooklyn, for the purpose
of publishing and distributing tracts
which set forth in a direct, positive
manner the teachiings of the Chnrch.
Why could not we establish an All-
Lutheran Truth Society, having mem
bers in all Lutheran synods, which
should publish and distribute Luther
an tracts setting forth the fundament
al teachings of the Bible and of our
chu/ch, free from that contriversial
spirit which has been dominant in the
past? What we need is a clear cut,
simple, positive statement of the
truths we as Lutherans confess, free
from elaborate refutations of what
other Christians may believe. This
may seem a strange statement for an
editor of a Lutheran church paper to
make, yet it is quite evident that the
spirit of the present age is such that
it will not countenance a controversial
apologetic, and the Catholic Church
knows it and is accommodating itself
accordingly in the interest of the ex
tension of truth as it sees it. Would
it be wrong for Protestantism and
Lutheranism to act in the same
spirit?
our readers again look upoi\ the
earnest features of Luther as he is
pictured standing before the Diet at
Worms, let them all resolve anew to
stand firm for their evangelic faith as
Luther did on that memorable occa
sion. Let them also resolve to be
better Lutherans than before, more
kind Christians in their relation to
others, more fervent in their prayers,
and more zealous and enthusiastic in
their witnessing for their Master.
And then let us all hope and pray and
strive jfor a Lutheranism, one and in
separable, in America which shall to
the present age be in the fullest and
most harmonious sense an exponent
of the faith for which Luther and the
Lutheran .fathers fought so valiantly
with the sword of the Word and the
spirit.—The Lutheran Companion.

—K-K-K—
--BY JOHN N. QUINN
“The authority of the Pope is not
superior but inferior to Scripture.”
“The time to be silent is past; the
time to speak has arrived.”
“Let us preserve our liberty.”
“Neither pope, nor bishop, nor any
other man living, has authority to'
impose the least thing upon a Chris
tian without his own consent.”
“We are free from all men.”
“Thb papacy is a general chaste,
led by the bishoD of Rome, and hav
ing for its object the snaring and
ruining of souls.”
“To be a Christian is to be not a
Roman.
What numberless errors and frauds
have crept in among tha poor delud
ed people under the cover of the
church and the pretended infallibility
of the pope! How many souls have
been lost! How much blood shed!
How many murders committed! How
many kingdoms laid waste”
“There is nothing under heaven
more corrupt and hateful than the
Roman court.”
—D’Aubigne’s History of the Reform
ation, Book VI.
These serious charges and solemn
words of warning, made by a brave
and fearless man four centuries ago,
are not less true and pertinent now,
for “Rome never changes.” She may
and does accommodate herself to
changed conditions, and alter her ap
pearance and utterances to deceive
and disarm oposition; but in principle,
policy and ambition, she does not
change. She still is the sapper and
miner of individual liberty and free
government and free institutions. Her
ambition now, as in past ages, is to
convert the world, not to Christ, but
to Rom c Catholicism. Were she
Christian, and had she the spirit,
broad mindedness and charity of the
Master, she would not teach that
salvation can be found only in her
teachings and ministrations, but
would recognize every movement, or
ganization and effort to Uplift man
kind and make men better and more
Christlike, $s of God, and bid it God
speed.
Let Luther’s words of warning still
be cherished and heeded.
Romanists hate the Ku Klux Klan
with a hatred peculiar to the Roman
Catholic system of ecclesiasticism.
The three K’s are a tremendous bar
rier erected by American patriots to
block her pathway to the goal she
has erected, America must be do
minantly Roman Catholic. Were the
papacy to achieve its goal, the doom
of the United States government
would be sealed. Rome is a bitter
opponent .of Constitutional govern
ment in the American sense; a demo
cratic Torm of government she de
scribes as a mob; the sovereignty of
the people in civil affairs she boast
ingly rejects.
“We, the people,’ is Americanism.
“I, the pope,” is Romanism.
The two systems can never be re
conciled. Americanism must triumph
over the system of darkness, whose
crown was cracked by the “hammer”
of the brave Luther. The same ham
mer is still needed. It should be
wielded today in such a manner that
the ecclesiastical crown of the papal
system shall be not only cracked but
crushed. The papacy triumphant
would mean world desolation; the pa
pacy conquered would result in the
establishment of God’s kingdom on
earth, a kingdom which, when estab
lished, will endure forever..
God’s eternal kingdom will not have
a jot or a tittle of the papal spirit
in any part of it—God will be sover
eign; “Our Lord God the Pope” will
be a thing of the past.—Unidentified.

The CALL OF THE NORTH
LITE DEMANDS SERVICE!
SACRIFICE!
• d i
The ancient order of worship con
sisted in the presentation of the dead
body of a victim, whose carcaae was
placed upon an altar and consumed
by fire, as the expiatory substitute
for man. The new, or Christian, or
der of worship calls for something
alive. Neither God nor man wishes a
dead thing. Among the activities of
men there is no room for a corpse,
literal or figurative. / Life demands
Service and Service calls for Life.
He who would serve, must be alive,
and all truly living men must serve.
It is the price of existence, the toll
for being alive. It is worth living to
serve. Life and Service go hand in
hand.
Service calls for sacrifice, but it
mpst be of the living .kind, and not
the sacrifice of a dead body. A lift
less carcass can avail nothing when
placed on the altar, however pious
the act may be. Kdansmen believe
in that kind of sacrifice which calls
for a living body placed on the altar
of Service, utilized by man and dedi
cated to God. By this kind of Ser
vice the Klansman lives. This is this
aim, his purpose, his ambition, in
life.
Service Counts
Nor is this ambition confined to
those of his kind, alone. He stands
with other Klansmen; he stands for
the Race. Toward other Klansmen
he is the soul of honor, possessing
unfeigned love, showing kindness,
giving preference rather than sel
fishly demanding for himself. Re
garding his personal affairs, the
Klansman is dutiful in business, re
joising because of his hope, patient
amid the trials of life, and hospitable,
withal. To those without, he is non
retaliative, honest, peaceable, and
even willing to return good for evil,
thereby proving his superior worth.
In his service to men, his method is
to overcome Evil with Good.
The Klansman has a policy that lies
far beyond his naturalization into
the membership of the Klan. To him,
naturalization is but enlistment for
service. It is the service that counts
with him. This lofty desire of the
Klansman to serve, comes from the
sense of duty, from the recognition
of obligation. He feels charged with
the ambition to be an active construc
tionist rather than a passive law
abiding figurehead. He thirsts for
duty; he demands the right to be use
ful. He feels it criminal to have and
not to give; to possess, and not to use.
He does not feel satisfied to be pas
sively goed. By becoming an active
benefactor he presents his body a liv
ing sacrifice, believing it to be accept
able to God because it is his reason
able service to his fellow-men.
Our Spiritual Aims
It is said of Him Who walked
among u’ lowly mortals as the Son of
God: He came not to be ministered
unto, but to minister, and to give
His life a ransom for the many. He,
therefore, Who is the Klansman,s Ex
emplar, sets the example to all Klans
men. To minister, and not to be min
istered unto, is the only worthy ex
cuse for existence. We are the heirs
of the ages. All that has gone before
is ours, being poured into our laps
from the cornucopia of tfie bounteous
past. The years gone before are ours.
The worthy men of these by-gone
years, are ours. Their great and
valient deeds are ours. Their prin
ciples. and their ideals are ours. Such
heritages more valuable than crowns
of gold, are handed down to us who
are the sons of such worthy fathers.
The memory of these great and noble
men, these defenders of the faith, can
best be kept green by our safe
guarding the ideals and the principles
which these* forefathers bequeathed
us. And how can this be done?
How, better, than by our living these
ideals and these principles, by our
making them a part of our being, as
vitually as bone of our bone and flesh
of our flesh?
Too long, be it admitted, has the
attention of the average American
been diverted to material gain, to
the over-looking of the spiritual.
Thoughts, ideals, principles, these be
long to the realm of the spiritual.
They are not as wood or stone; as
gold or silver. They cannot be weigh
ed on the scales nor measured by
tangible device. Being of the spirit
ual, they will exist forever, for the
things which are seen are temporal,
but the things which are not seen,
they are the eternal. These undy
ing bequests from our venerated
fathers are to be incorporated by us,
their sons, thus having them to live
again in our bodies, as in a resurrec
tion body. Sired by fearless pioneers,
inheriting the aspirations of the un
daunted, the ambitions of the ideal
ists, the honor of the chivalrous, the
reverence of the faithful, the Klans
men possesss a position to be coveted
by angels.

THE STORY OF THE HU KLUXKLAN
Grand Dragon, Realm of Georgia, and a Grand
son of General Nathan Bedford Forrest, Con
federate Cavarlry Leader, Who Was Grand
Wizard of the Original Klan.
-K-K *—
At the close of the “War Between
the States,” the Confederate States
were practically without governments
those which they had established af
ter their withdraws 1 from the Union
having been overthrown. The great
question before the Country was what
to do with the Southern States, They
had been declared insurgents, and
therefore it was contended that their
relation to the United Staes Govern
ment was that of a “conquered terri
tory.” It was President Lincoln’s
plan to accomplish the restoration of
the seceding states with as little de
lay as pqssible, and he had outlined a.
policy to that end, maintaining that
they had never really been out of the
Union but only “out of practical re
lations with the Government.” After
Lincoln’s death, President Johnson
undertook to carry out the purposes
of his predecessor and in May, 1865,
issued a proclamation of pardon to
practically all those engaged in the
war. Following the action of the
President, most of the Southern
States called conventions and repeal
ed their ordinances of secession, ac
cepting the act of President Johnson
in good faith.
States Reorganize
By the autumn of 1865, every
Southern state, except Texas, was re
organized and had ratified the Thir
teenth jnendment. When Congress
assembled in December, 1865, Re
publican opposition was manifest in
an enactment that no state should be
represented in either House till Con
gress had declared its right to repre
sentation. There were leaders in
Congress, however, headed by the in
famous Thaddeus Stevens, who did
not approve of any lenient methods
and refused to recognize the Southern
States when their representatives ap
peared to take their seats in the capi
tal. Their chief idea was to punish
the South, claiming that they were
“conquered provinces” in which the
people had not even civil rights. The
ex-Confederates were disfranchised
and excluded from holding office. The
South was then divided into five mili
tary districts, in each of which was
placed an army with a military Gov
ernor in command. Martial law was
declared throughout the South. The
Commander of each district was to
have registered as voters all persons,
without regard to race or color, who
had not taken part in the war. As
this law disfranchised all the leading
white men of the South and gave the
ballot to the negro, many of whom
were only one generation removed
from savagery, the result can be ima
gined.
Under the leadership of Ihe “car
petbaggers,” who, like vultures, had
swept out of the North to prey upon
the of the prostrate South, the
ignorant negro rode into power, and
the black heel was placed upon the
neck of the proudest race the sun
ever shone upon. Under the rule of
the carpetbagger and the schalawag,
the negro ran riot. Every indignity
was offered the people of the South,
and they were forced to stand idle
while their wives and daughters were
openly insulted, without hope of re
dress. Then, when hope almost fled
and destruction seemed inevitable, the
pyre “Anglo-Saxon blood” in the
South rose in its might and the Ku
Klux Klan was born.
During the month of May in the
year 1866, six young Confederate
soldiers living in the city of Pulaski,
Tenn., formed an organization for so
cial purposes. This society named it
self “The Kuklos,” which comes from
the Greek word KluKloi, and from
which we get our words “circle” and
cycle.” The name mepit literally a
circle or a band. In later days per
haps for the purpose of making the
organization more mysterious, it was
called the Ku Klux and word Klan
was added. Aside from the evident
intent to incite curosity and interest
by the selection of a weird name, the
name itself indicated the culture of
the men who founded the organiza
tion. This remarkable organization,
bordering on the miraculous, was the
most mysterious, the most secret,
and at the same time the most po
tented and powerful body that ever
rose, resigned, and after accomplish
ing the purpose of its existence,
voluntarily disbanded, its members
retiring victoriously in decency, good
order and invisible triumph.
Was Complete Mystery
No authentic history of this won
derful organization has ever been
written, and now over half a century
after it has ceased to exist, there is
no positive or definite information
concerning it or the works which it
wrought. The passage of years has
thinned the ghostly ranks of the
weird brotherhood, a mystery the Ku
Klux Klan was born, a mystery it
lived and died, and mystery shall for
ever haunt its grave.
No man was solicited to join.
Every applicant, came voluntarily
and wag admitted to membership af
ter subscribing to the oath of secre
cy, free from any outside pressure.
The Klan grew with amazing rapidity
and in a short time spread as far
north as the Potomac River, and as
far south as the Rio Grande and the
Gulf of Mexico. New dens or lodges
were established in every part of the
country. This rise and expansion of
the “invisible empire” occurred be
tween June 1886, and April, 1867.
There is nothing in history to parallel
it. .More than half a million men, de
feated in war, reduced almost to pau
perism, rose upon the ruins of their
homes and organized themselves into
an irtvincible and invisible army and
won the greatest victory of Anglo-
Saxon civilization.
In 1867 a convention composed of
representatives of the Klan through
out the Confederate States met at
Nashville, Tenn. The first declara
tion made by the Klan in convention
was one of loyalty to the Union, as
follows: “We recognize our relations
to the United States, the supremacy
of the Constitution and Constitutional
laws thereof, and the Union of the
States thereunder. I ” —This forever
refutes the charge that these men
were plotting treason.
Purposes of the Original Klan
The Nashville Convention also de
fined and set forth the objects and
purposes of the Klan as follows: ,
1. “To protect the weak, the inno
cent and the defenseless, from the in
dignities, wrongs and outrages, from
the lawless, the violent and the bru
tal; to relieve the injured and the op
pressed, to succor the suffering and
especially the widows and orphans of.
Confederate soldiers.
2. “To protect and. defend the
Constitution of the United States and
all laws passed in conformity there
unto, and to protect the States and
people from all invasion from any
source whatever.
3. “To aid and assist in the ex
ecution of all constitutional laws, and
to protect the people from unlawful
seizure and from trial, except by
their peers in conformity to the laws
of the land.”
The Klan had become such a pow
erful machine that the members real
ized the vital necessity of having a
leader, and General Nathan Bedford
Forrest, of Memphis, Tenn., the Con
federate cavalry leader, was elected
as Grand Wizard, the obligation being
given him in Room 10, at the old
Maxwell House at Nashville, Capt.
Jno. W. Morton, who had beep For
dest’s Chief of Artillery during the
war.
Associated with General Forrest
were many of the most prominent
leaders of the Confederacy. Gen.
Albert Pike was Chief Judiciary Of
ficer and Advisor, General Jno. Gor
don was Grand Dragon of Georgia,
General Jno. H. Forney was Grand
Dragon of Alabama, General Wade
Hampton, Grand Dragon of South
Calorina, While General W. Gordon of
Tennessee wrote the ritual and took
an active part in the deliberations of
the Klan.
Under the leadership of General
Forrest, the Klan swept the South
like a whirlwind, restoring order out
of Chaos, and saving the civilization
of the South from utter destruction.
The entire South was an Invisible
Empire under a Grand Wizard. Each
State was a Realm under a Grand
Dragon; several counties formed a
Dominion under a Grand Titan; each
county was a Province under a Grand
Giant; the smallest division being
a Den, under a Grand Cylops. The
Klan was twice reorganized, in 1867
and in 1868, each time being more
centralized. In 1869 the organiza
tion was disbanded by order of Gener
al Forrest, the Grand Wizard, and the
order was dissolved almost in a night,
although imitations of the Klan ex
isted for a year or more longer.
Some histories record the fact that
the Klan was disbanded as a result of
the action of the United States Gov
ernment, but this is an error. The
Klan was in active operation until its
leaders decided that the purpose for
which it had been formed had been
accomplished. The Government made
every effort to suppress the Klan, but
it was utterly powerless to cope with
the situation, and he Klan was not
disbanded until orders were given by
the Grand Wizard.
The ghostly legions have long since
disappeared, their purpose accom
plished and a civilization saved. The
Dragons and Giants, the Ghblins and
Hydras, the Cyclops and Furies, and
the Night Hawks and Ghouls, have
crossed over the river to rest in the
shade of the trees with their im
mortal commander, secure in the
knowledge that they have settled for
all time the question of White su
premacy, and that through them a
Nation has been reborn.
They will live in song and story,
and as the years roll by the whole
world will pay them tribute, for to
the eternal glory of the Southern peo
ple, although the United States Gov
ernment offered fabulous rewards for
the men who would betray the secrets
of the order, and although the women
of the South made the robes of the
Klan and knew of thia offer, there
was never a traitor. — Dawn.

ioned gate,
Where the woodbine clings to the
porch as of yore,
And the whipporwill calls to his
mate.
To that sacred old place again I’ll re
turn
Where she moulded and fashion
ed my way,
And in reverence kneel where we laid
her to rest
And watch ’till the close of the
day.
When the day has grown old and the
deep shadows lay,
Where the pale of the moon casts
its glow,
I’ll follow the brook in the silvery
sheen
To a place where fragrant flowers
grow,
And there where I spent golden days
that have passed
I’ll pluck just the sweetest that
bloom,
Then carry them back to that spot I
revere
And place them on my mother’s
tomb.
All the pleasures of life with their
riches and fame
I’d gladly give back for the joy
Of the passionate kiss and that won
derful touch
Of my mother when I was a boy.

A TOAST TO THE FUB

Here’s to the Red of it,
There’s not a thread of it,
No, nor a shred of it,
In all the spread of it,
From foot to head
But heroes bled for it,
Faced steel and lead'for it,
Precious blood shed for it,
Bathing it Red.
Here’s to the White of it,
Thrilled by the sight of it
Who knows the right of it,
But feels the weight of it
Throqgh day and night;
Womanhood’s care for it
Made manhood dare for it,
Purity’s prayer for it
Keep it so White.
Here’s to the Blue of it,
Heavenly view of it,
Star-spangled hear of it,
Honesties die of it
Constant and True.
Here’s to the whole of it,
Stars, Stripes and Pole of it,
Here’s to the soul of it,
Red, White and Blue.
