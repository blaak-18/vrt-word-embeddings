clear and succinct manner gives his CcIu
h Views on the subject :
I regret that I have not sufficient
data upon which to found a reason
able estimate of the cost of such a
structure. That would require a
more critical and accurate examina- City
I tion of the ground intervening be
e tween the spring and. the probable
. terminus than I have given it, and
t anything I can say on the sub
ject must be simply suggestive.
A short column of level notes de
velops the fact that the present ele
vation of the water surface at the
spring is 2.7T feet above that of the '
,- bank of the river at the foot of Texas nest
street, or say three feet above the men
gound at the Court House. This is at ti
the important fact, and furnishes of t
the basis upon which the work must yan
r- proceed. The shortest practicable lnd
e route between the points, I should in w
*" think from a casual observation, lays cour
' around by way of the head of Wash- The
* ington street, or in that vicinity, and bou
w is about i of a mile long. The feasi- whi
e bility of the project depends upon enel
i the amount of water which the foun- earl
y tain will supply and upon the quanti- eset
h" ty required in seasons of protracted
e- drouth. Upon this will also depend
f the required diameter of the pipes. R
o The fall is insufficient to bring the ed
e water here rapidly, and absolutely Mal
, incompetent to force it into Hydrants gon
of a convenient bight. To secure hay
these two requisites, pressure at the m,
spring must be resorted to, either by hin
V. mechanical appliances, ifthe supply the
be is abundant, or, if not, by raising pen
as the water into a suitable reservoir
ce and letting gravity do the balance.
8- The latter would probably be the
se least expensive and most satisfactory, ats
of An abundant store of water could be a;
do kept at the reservoir to be used as das
re- necessity required. I can see no ob- thiu
I- stacle, that is not surmountable at a cot
y. moderate expense, to bringing all co
ty the water here that is there. If the oui
)t necessity is as great as is frequently ish
M stated, and as is evident, the cost is the
he too unimportant to be weighed tot
ng against the benefits. Many smaller me
e- cities, with less urgent necessitles an,
rd and smaller amounts of capital in- oo
d vested in business, have secured
be water at much greater cost.

simply because It was fashionable to

ble would pawn their jewels rather tha w
loh forego their annual trip. But a more
of healthy feeling pervades the mlndse of t
3our people now, and nlastead of spend

devote it to beautifying their own

THE COSIBOVE-H EAIISEY iATTER. 8
A Card.
It seems to be expected that I alec
u should reply to the many cards and have
statements which Gen. Oongrove and f
Major tinarsey have seen (It to pub. with

where it began-iu their respective
journals. Major Hearsey, however l
ito his latest card assures the public 1
that his friends "will, of ccutrse, do
me the justice to state that I declin- t
i ed to accede to the terms proposed." c
He further states that "the statement
I to which my name is appended was
never signaed by, me." The italics are
Major Hearseey's own.O
Impelled by what I consider to be
the unjustifiable publication otl the
correspondence and terms agreed Sapp
upon between Major Buck and my
self, after Major Hearsey' refusal to Pur
adopt the same, and still further by and
18 Major Hearsey's demand upon me.
I have this much to say: I may add pare
that I trust I may be permitted to
make it the last I have to say.
In the States, of the 20th May Maj.
Hearsey published an article which Dest
could scarcely have been made more ish
l Insulting to Gen. Cosgrove. Instead aas
- of demanding satisfaction for the In- Old
n suit, Gen, Cosgrove telegraphs gross- whe
ly insulting words about Maj. Hear
say which were published in the De- F
mocrat of the 28th May. In the r
it 8tates of 29th" May, Major Hearsey whi
rejoins in another article with re- and
peated and additional insult to Gen. invi
SCogrove. On the morning of June be
4th the Democrat announced, at the
n head of its editorial columns that
Gen. Cosgrove was in the city, and
would remain in New Orleans till
B Saturday evening, the 5th June. fie
o Major Hearsey called at my office
y about 12 o'clock on Friday, and hand- co
ing me a letter addressed to Gen. De"
Gosgrove, asked me to deliver it Coto
with enclosures (thetirstthese letters, c
as they are published). The Major
distinctly informed me that he had
no ground or desire of quarrel, with DR
t Mr. Cosgrove, except that growing
t. out of his telegram of 28th May. He
also stated to me that he did not of
himself assert the truth of the facts
he charged as true in his article of 26th whi
er May, but that that editorial, was st
y based entirely upon the statements
of the gentlemen whose names were
( given. What he required was that
Gen. Cosgrove should retract the of- j
fensive epithets and hie charge that W
Major Hearsey had "manufactured
evidence" and "knowingly publish- L1i
ti- ed" a snander upon him in his tele
n, gram of May 28th. I have been in
formed that some other gentleman
had counseled an immediate and
le peremptory challenge by Major Ha
he Hearsey. But, while I did not sug.
st gest the first letter, I did not consi
of der that Major Hearses was in a po
sition to challenge, having given the
Sfirst insult, and never in any manner
m withdrawn it. wh
is It is, I believe, among gentlemen, pri
conceded that when one is insulted, of
et mere words, however exaggerated or the
M embellished by epithets, do not and C
he cannot shift the insult, nor relieve ie
the person first insulted of the oblI
gation to resent the 'same in a gen
tiemanly way. For this reason I
consented to deliver the note of Maj.
ng Rearsey. On meeting Major Buok
be remarked that nla his judgment
01- the matter ought to be settled ami
