A LORENZ
HOSPITAL FOR
CHICAGO
(Special Correspondence.]
Chicago, -... ..,.-The various ru"
more regarding J. Ogden Armour's in
tention of making public recognition of
the reclamation of his little daughter
Lolita from a life of helplessness have
at last crystallized into the definite
announcement that Mr. Armour has
decided to honor the skill of I)r. Adolf
Lorens by founding in Chicago n hos
pital and new school of surgery to be
known as the Lolita Armour Institute
of Bloodless Surgery. It is understood
that Dr. Friedrich Muller, who for six
years has been Dr, Lorenz's assistant.
will be the first head of the institute.
The story of how Mr. Armour made
his intention known Is in itself not de
void of interest. When Dr. Lorenz and
Dr. Muller were passing through Chi
cago, bound east, after their tour of
the western cities, they were enter
tained at Mr. Armour's home, and be
fore leaving Dr. Lorenz made a thor
ough examination of his youthful pa
tient. At the conclusion of this he in
formed the anxious parents that their
child was now as well as any child.
Upon this Mr. and Mrs. Armour
turned to Dr. Muller, and Mr. Armour
then informed that surgeon that he in
tended to establish an institution or a
school of bloodless surgery in com
memoration of his daughter's cure
through the skill of Dr. Lorens. He
urged that Dr. Muller becorfie the head
of the institute. The wealthy Chicago
man then said that for the first time
since Lolita Armour *as born be and
Mrs. Armour were happy.
'Make Chicago your home, and you
will not regret it," added Mr. Armour
to Dr. Muller.
Dr. Muller requested the advice of
Dr. Lorens, and the latteg said that the
ofer' should be accepted: Mr. Armour
and Dr. Muller then grasped hands,
ad the agreement was made. They at
once discussed plans for the institu
ties
According to the announced intention
of Mr. Armour, the institute will be
abslmutely free to all ts need of treat
meat There I not to be a knife in the
ilaee, and a specialty wilt be made of
treating children who are crippled as
the IIle Aimer girl was. It is under
