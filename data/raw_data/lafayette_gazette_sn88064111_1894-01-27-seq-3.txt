A special from Breaux Bridge to
the Picayune of Jan. 24, says:
"Yesterday while Nicolas, the x2

chi, a prominent grocer of this town,
was out hunting, accompanied by
two of his young friends, he acci
dentally shot himself in the left arm,
which caused a compound fracture
of the bone. Drs. Martin and Du
rio were immediately called in. Both
physicians think that amputation
will not be necessary.
Geo. K. Bradford, of Crowley,

it now holds. He founded the old
Acadia Sentinel and through its
columns invited the home-seeker to
the fertile soil of Acadia.

Methodist Church Conference.
The first quarterly conference of
the district stewards of the Metho- 1
church met last WVednesday in that I
church, Rev. J. M. Beard, D. D.,
presiding Elder for the Opelousas
district in the chair. Rev. T. S.
Randle, the local pastor, participated ,
in the proceedings. Rev, Dr. Beard
is at present a resident of New Or
leans, but since his appointment to
this district, will doubtless make
Lafayette his home. Dr. Beard ex- i
pressed himself as favorably im
pressed with our town and people,
and we hope soon to see him perma
nently among us. The reverend
gentleman is an eloquent and forci- I
ble expounder of the Scriptures, and
treated his congregation Tuesday
night and Wednesday morning, to
feasts of things spiritual. A quar
terly church conference was also
held Wednesday, in connection I
with the district conference. t
Wanted fot Murder.
Marshal Vigneaux arrested last
Saturday a young negro giving his
name as James Lewis on a charge f i
being a dangerous and suspicious
character. Lewis is about 24 years
old, 5 feet x inches high, rather I
light in color, and weighs about x45
pounds. He has a scar on the left
leg just above the ankle, this wound
was doubtless inflicted by a bullet. I
Lewis answers very strongly to the
description of Willie Green, wanted
in Tallulah, La., for the murder of
Mitchell, near Davis Bend, Missis
sippi. So firmly convinced is Mar
shal Vigneaux of the indentity of his
prisoner, that he has communicated
,rith th"e authorities of Tallulah, and f
will hold Lewis until satisfied that
he is not the murderer wanted. Ai
S ois offered for the
-1.· - -. - . i A
Schools at Carencro.
Wednesday, Jan. 24, was the
day fixed for the examination of
the pupils of the Carencro Paro
chial Schools.. The audience was
r a very appreciative one. Among
those present were Rev. Fathers
Whitney and McCalligo of the St.
Charles College, Grand Coteau.
The boys of St. Peter's Academy,
under the tutorship of Prof. C. F.
Latiolais, proved themseves really
worthy of their school. All, from
the lowest to the highest class, stood
the test with marked ability, every
pupil making a creditable showing.
Ernest Coussan, Clarence Ber
nard and Viateur Grenier proved
very propicient in U. S. History,
Geography, English Grammar,
Arithmetic, spelling and definitions.
Camille Couvlllon, Ulysse Lacour,
and David Martin could not be em
harassed either in reading, spelling,
definitions. or geography.
The boys in the lower classes did
remarkably well. Space will not
permit to name all who deserve spe
cial mention. The promptness and
accuracy of Leonce Prejean, Hubert
Dupuis and Andre Prejean in an
swering questions gained for them
the admiration of the audience.
They certainly deserve much praise
for it is seldom that boys of their
age show as much aptitude in their
studies.
The little girls were quick, intelli
gible and accurate, both in their an
swers and recitations. In fact,
none of them could have been ex
pected to do better. Among those
deserving special mention are: Sarah
Brown, Euchariste Mattieu and Liz
zie Dimitry. Miss Sarah's recitation
of "Somebody's Darling" was excel
lent; she also recited a French piece
entitled "L.es Trois Jours de Chris
tophe Colomb" and in this recitation,
as in the first, she elicited much
merited applause.
Every class was thoroughly ex
amined and proved very efficient.
The success of this school is due to
the supervision of Father LaForest
and to the painstaking efforts of its
competent teachers.

About performing the imxlre--ive cere:n-,ny
of the Episcopal church. 'The house w:;
artsitically decorate] with pal nettos, fern I
and quantities of other evergreens, interrmin-g
gled with roses and canclia.. In the eentre,
of the drat;ing room hung evergreens in h:
shape of a hell, from which was suspenled a
a bouquet of magnificent white flowers, and
there the gro:om and his best man, Mr. J.
C. Nickerson, awaited the bride. At the ap
pointed hour, the wedding march was bril
liantly executed by Mrs Alfred 1Mouton, and
the bridal party entered. Pretty little Maxim ,
Beraud, looked a real fairy, carrying the
cushion on which the bride was to kneel.
She was attended by Master Lorne Nicker
son. Then came the maid of honor, Miss
Mary Toms, of Sincoe, Canada, who was
beautiful in her becoming c stume of rich
yellow silk, and Miss Stella Trahan, the
lovely bridemaid, in silk and organdy. Both
these young ladies wore silver hair orna
ments, gifts of the groom. Then, the bride
leaning on her father's arm, appeared. She
was a vision of youthful loveliness in her ex
quisite bridal dress of soft white silk, trimmed
with rich lace and orange bl,ossoms, her lithe
some figure being enveloped in snowy tulle
which fell in folds to the end of the train.
She carried a houquet of white rosebuds,
tied loosely with satin streamers.
Miss Lella is a lovely young lady, possess
ing rare qsalities which have endeared her to
a large cir4 of friends, who wish her every
happiness in her neaw life. Mr. D)arling, whom
we heartily congratulate on winning such a
prize, although camparatively a stranger here,
having corn,- South a year ago, and taken up
his residence, has already gained the esteem
and confidence of a host of friends.
After the ceremony, a bounteous supper I
was served in the spacious dining room and
toasts were drank to the newly made couple.
From 8 30 to to o'clock, a receptionl
was held and the friends of the young couple
had occasion to tender them their congratula
tions.
Mrs. Nickerson, mother of the bride, was
richly dressed in a handlsome black silk with
jet ornaments. She was assisted in receiving
and entertaining by the following young
ladies in pretty evening dresses: Misses
Haydee Trahan, Zerelda Bailey. Leah Le
Blane and Nellie Bailey. Among the guests
were: Dr. and Mrs. Trahan, Dr. and Mrs.
Mudd, Mrs. M. E. Girard, Mrs. Magill, Mr.

of the ladies were rich and elegant.

their home in Abbeville. s
A "'Pink fta."
A most charming entertainment was the t
"Pink Tea" given by Mrs. T. M Iliossat t
from 4 to 6 o'clock on Tfuesday afternoon in a
honor of her mother and sister, Mrs and Miss
Rushing of Alexandria. T'he cosy home pre
sented a-lively appearance; larmps shaded
with pinh silken shades wee placed albont t
arranged apartment. The dining room was
tastefully decorated, pink being the prevail
ing color; garlands of mull and ribbons were
twined about and plateaus of camelias were
placed upon the" table, producing a lovely
effect. The refreshments which were dainty
and tempting, were served by Misses Villa
Rushing, Yolande Rigues and Lizzie Parker
son, all three prettily and becomingly attired
in costumes of pink.

The Clemenceau Case.
Miss Atkinson was at her best last night
in the role of Iza, in the French play, The
Clemenceau Case. Her conception of the
part was the ;true" one-that' of a beautiful
young girl, somewhat vain and foolish but
not bad at heart, who was formed and
fashioned by a scheming heartless mother,
whom she loved, into a bold and designing
woman, devoid of moral sense and full of
guile and all sensual attractions; one who
loved her husband up to her full capacity,
but who prferred to be his mistress rather
than his wife in order to escape a wife's
restraint. Miss Atkinson's acting was finished
as well as full of power, portraying in a life
like manner the commingled and changed
feelings and emotions of her part.
There was nothing in the presentation of
the play that could offend the public taste
or be detrimnental to morals; it being on the
other hand a powerful object-lesson sermon
on the dangers and temptations of the world,
the flesh and the devil.-Evening Item.
Maud Atkinson will open on Feb. i a four
days' engagement at Falk's Opera House,
with this popular and sensational play.
Sugar Refinery.
We have not heard any body talk
refineny lately. Perhaps this appa
rent indifference on the part of the
people is due to the uncertainty of
future sugar legislation. It is a mat
ter of utter impossibility to say
what Congress will do with sugar.
At any rate let the people of the
parish, and especially those living
near this town, keep their eyes wide
open. The Gazette is in receipt of
a letter from a gentleman engaged
in the tnanmufact'ire of sugar, who
"visited thiis parish several times and
expressed lisoself as most favorably
impressed with the advantages of
fercst by ti. is section for a sugar re
finst.ry. Amonig oti.er encouraging
words t:.e letter contains the follow
ing : "Expect to be in yoi-r town at

-"Betsey" on morals, in last
week's Gazette, is to the point. Only
we fear '-John Barley" will never be
eradicated from this state. Still, we
live to iiope. Who knows?
-After sifting the "pros" and
"cons" thoroughly, we believe that a
satisfactory way of keeping the
public roads in proper condition
would be to contract with reliable
citizens at lowest bidder every five
miles of road. Bonds to be far
jnished, and forfeited, unless work is
Spronounced satisfactory by experts.
"Tne payments to be made by par
ish quarterly, semi-yearly, or yearly,
as the case may be. It stands to reason
tihat any mnan can, without the least
trouble or difficulty, keep under
control five miles of r::,t, anid we
feel sure at a very slighit expense.
The mere appearance of a hole
would call tihe contractor's attention,
as by immediate refilling, trouble
and expenses would be saved by ihim.
No doubt, some of the critics will
,say, this plan has been tried and
failed. But behold the vast differ
ence between forty and five. It is
a matter of impossibility for any
man, whether his intentions are fair
or not, to keep in a ptacticable and
good condition forty miles of road.
We would like to hear from somne
correspIondent on this five-mile
contract.

Gerard Romer., respected farmers

for a while was doubtful, but with
the untiring and unceasing efforts of
a few public spirited citizens, it at
last reached the mark. We deem
it necessary to mention the names
of the principal workers in this great
cause, but we say with pride, that
many a tender spot is to be found
in the hearts of the many, who will
ever appreciate in recognition the
faithful services rendered by these
promoters of education.
CHEROKEE.
DIED.
Mrs. Jane E. Campbell, relict
of the late Dr. Wm. G. Mills, de
parted this life at the residence of
Mrs. H. Beraud, on Sunday, Jan.
21, 1~94, in the seventy-third year
of her age.
Though for some time in feeble
health, and weighed down with the
infirmities of more than three scores
and ten years, this venerable mother
in Israel, bore with Christian for
titue every dispensation of divine
Providence and was gathered to
the Fathers as a sheaf of golden
grain, rife and mellow in every
Christian grace and virtue. With
meekness antd resignation, thiis no
ble worman passed away, surrounded
by sorrowing relatives and friends.
IZath far her had no terrors, fnr
soothed and sustained by an unfal
terilng trust, 'she wrapped the
drapery of her couch about tier and
lay down to pleasant dreams." So
-peace.ful, so glorious an end was in
deed a fitting consummation of a
long and eventful life, a life which
shone forth as an illustrious exam
ple of true Southern womanhood.
Mrs. Mills, for the many charms of
her womanly character, was honored
and esteemed by the entire com
munity and her death has cast a
gloom over many hearts.
A consis.tet :member of the
MethoiiWt iEpis,:pal church, Mrs.
Mlils examrplihed, in a marked de
gree, that meek and lovely spirit
of the divine Master, in whom she
trusted. In all the vicissitudes of
life she maintained a steadfast de
votion to her religious principles
and died in that joy and peace
whIch alone can come from the
blessed assurance of the Christian
religion.
Mrs. Mills a was native of Pitts
burg, Pa, but has been a resident of
Lafayette fiflty.eigitt years, hav
ing rem:oved hiti:er some timne
in 1836, and afterward married Dr.
Mills wno became one of the most
eminent physicians in this section.
An only son. Joon Mills, diedl but
recently at Breaux Bridge. The
late Hion. \VWu. Campbell. a promi
n-nt business man of Lafayette,
w as a:n only brot:er of the dlcaceased.
Mrs. Hi. Beraud, all only sister,
though advanced in years was en
abled to minister the last deeds of
affection to the departed one, and
sllooth the pillow' of death. Hou.
\VWin. Campbell. mayor of Lafayette
was anep.iyw ot ti:he decea:ed. and
perforlned in tihe last iri1, everyv
duty wilich affection could prompt.
T"o the grief stricken family, the
Gazette would express its most pro
found sympathiy, and tender the
consolation of Christian hope, to
assuage the sorrow which now
overshadows their hearts.. All that
was mortal of this estimable woman,
was laid to rest in the Protestant
cemetery, Jan. 22. Rev. T. S. Ran
die officiating at the funeral cere
monies. A large concourse of friends
and relaives followed tie body to
tne grave, and paid the last sad rites
to the beloved dead.
