On last Saturday an old gentle
man entered the cars, at Sabula, of

conversation with a fellow-passen

for which, upon returning horn#,- ho
substituted ä cork liinb. His iast
union was blessed with several
children, and all wCnt along smooth
ly until the year I860, when lie and
his wife beghn discussing, the vir
tues of their former spouses, which
produced a serious quarrel, ending
by his wife driving him from home,
lake Bip Van Winkle, ho kissed
his children and departed without
one word of complaint or reproof.
From his own threshold he wander
ed over almost every portion of tho
world, and for .f^tyfc yeajs jiis fami
ly never received either:-letter or
pressage from him. ... '" ■ lrtf
On Saturday,, wJien hc took tho
ears at Sabula, ho was within a few
miles of his old home, from which
he, too, had never heard a word
since the day he left. On the train
he met an old acquaiiitahc 5 ^, 1 who
informed him that his wife, suppo
sing lie had died, had married again
and had two children by her, ( last
union; that she was living on tho
name old farm, and,' as Enoch Ar
den was told-of Anhie,'/wast hap
py."' The old mün. replied that he
was not grieved 4t® that, but that
he returned to see his children, of
whom he spoke very affectionately.
At the third station the train stop
ped and a young lady entered, who,
upon perceiving the old gentleman,
examined him very closely, t^'tcr
which "she asked his name. He told
her, and exclaiming, "Then,'iyou
are, my fatherP she .threw herself
into the old man's arms. Both shed
tears of joy at the reunion, and our
informant described the scene as
very affecting. That old gentle
man had accumulated quîtyVîi'beat
sum of money in his wafrdettrigs,
^vliieli he says he inteifflé 'Minself.
and children to enjoy, and 'that he
.will leave his wife find her new
