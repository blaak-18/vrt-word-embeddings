It will not do for everyone to do exact- teai
ly the same way. to plant the smae air
crops, raise the same kind.o, stock and low
proportion the same alike. - There must arl
be more or less originality displayed is a
by each man. sup
Well, one of the most appropriate I
things to do this midwinter period is twc
to think strongly, discuss the situation wil:
with men of hard sense and mnake coti
such allotments of the several crops as for
best appear to fit the present situation. soil
It is a great pity more grain of one ril
kind or another was not sown in Octo- cre
ber. A large crop of oats next summer One
would mean a great saving in corn, ver
and it appearances are worth any- are
thing, well preserved corn will comr go
mand a good price next spring; will be L
well worth saving. the
Doubtless there is almost- as much abi
clear profit in oats at thirty-five cents lat
a bushel as there is in cotton at five of
cents a pound; that is, if a man knows pea
I how to raise oats and goes at it in a his
proper way. wil
Over a large section of the country er'
s oats when sown in December are not cnl
subject to injury oftener than one year on
in three, if they are put in properly the
with harrow and roller; but over the sta
greater portion this rule may be said to me
apply if the sowing can not be made in we
October and by the 10th of November, lea
it is better to wait until February be- it
fore putting in the crop. In the inter- the
val, an extra plowing of the land will ']
tend to increase the yield several bush- poi
els. As a rule our farmers bestow very ap,
little care on the seeding of this crop. in
In hundreds of instances the seeds, a sor
bushel or so, are broadcasted, more or his
less unevenly on the unbroken soils cee
and turned under with a plow, the soil hu
being left in as rough a state as that hie
kind of an implement can leave it. mi
Not much of a cropshould be expected
from this manner of treatment. If die
the land should happen to be good, a Cr
yield of eighteen or twenty bushels cl(
may be secured, but where, if more be
care had been bestowed in the seeding, 4
the yield could easily have been da
doubled. We think there is no exag- fan
geration in the statement that land an
that yields three hundred pounds of th
lint cotton can be made to produce wi
forty bushels of oats, this yield from a w
sowing made early in February, in ar
middle Georgia; a few bushels more, if th
the sowing is made in October or Sep- w;
tember. ar
It may be that many will yet decide oc
to venture a larger sowing of spring se
oats than they had originally intended, W
and we have no doubt it .will be a la
wise conclusion. If sown properly in w
February, in January in more south
erly section, and using an acclimated
variety-fairly rust-proof-anywhere
from 15 to 60 bushels may be gathered
next June. It is quite likely the grain
will command a price that will make m
the result fairly remunerative to the
grower. If good land is used for this Ea
purpose, and it should appear long i'
h about June that there is a good pros- o1
pect for cotton picking up in
prices, this land can be planted to n
cotton with a very fair chance of mak- u
: ing a good crop as if it were planted in ti
May or earlier. Farmers who have
had much experience in planting the h
staple in April and June are sure that 01
there is very little difference in the ap- d
pearance of the stalk in September of
two plantings made eight or nine
S weeks apart: that is a planting made
y April 15 and another June 15. Of
course we would not advocate a large
planting of cotton next year; still, as
we said, if the signs were good in June
for cotton advancing a cent or two, a
crop of oats could be followed by one n
of cotton if a farmer so desired. 1
As a rule peas should follow grain if t
it is deemed advisable to turn the land
afresh in midsummer. When the prac- s
tice of sowing clover with spring grain I
of any kind has become more general )
a in the south, there will be very little 1
grain stubble plowed in June, as the
clover will come on and take possession
of the land without any plowing. We
would like to see the day when such a
practice was a common one in our
country.
3 The only rational and truly econom
s ical way of restoringsthe lost fertility
Sof our long cultivated soils is
Sthrough the medium of leguminious
Scrops grown specially for manurial
purposes.
There are several clovers that our
Ssouthern farmers can use for restoring
the humus that has been almost en
tirely burnt out in the pasttwenty-five
years.
We wish that we could persuade a
few thousand farmers who read the
Southern Farm to make a fair test of
sowing clover with their grain. If
they could be persuaded to try it once
Sand make a success of it we would
soon see a perfect tidal wave of soil
improvement.
. Taking land that has been plowed,
say once, in January, harrow in the
two and a half or three bushels of oat
seed early in- February, and immedi
ately afterward sow ten or twelve
(eight might do) pounds of red or sap
L ling clover, sowing it as early as pos
sible, then give the land a good roll
ing. Very few of our farmers have
such an implement as a roller, we are
sorry to say.
If a farmer hasn't one and can not
hire or borrow one, of course he will
have to do the best he can without the
roller. A drag is the next best resort
to nu over the land after sowing the
s If be has no drag he will have
tpaut up with a brush. When aroller
la weed it presses the seed and soil
llrmi together, and thisis sall the
a heeded. The rolling must be

t ofajt wg i "ar" ' and, "Crimson5 uni
loveri (thbe two we refer to) will not in f
grow through the summer. These di
two, it sown in the fall or in February, sta
ripen their seed late in the spring and
die down. They are both annuals and broi
are strictly winter growers-the very by
reverse of our field peas. This charac- mor
â€¢teristl+erenders these clovers more de-. tio
sirable than peas for manurial or fal- $200
low purposes and especially where se
early pasture or an early crop of hay chu
is desired, still more marked in their
superiority. ing
But the most extended use of these afs
two clovers, we believe, ultimately, whK
will be found in sowing them in the wh
cotton fields in October and November Mrs
for the main purpose of keeping the qui
soil from being washed by the winter gol
rains, and later on in the serlng the
crop turned under to enrich the land. fer
One good crop of Crimson or Bur clo- nom
vet turned under would so enrich our cat
average soils as to make a show of its of
good effects for several years. son
Until a farmer comes to appreciate wo
the necessity for supplying his soil ser
abundantly with hpmus, and so regu- car
lates his practices as to give each acre list
of arable land a fair crop of clover (or -
peas) every two years, he will not see lit
his farm in condition to supply him five
with profitable crops. There is nooth- mil
er way of restoring fertility to long enc
eultivated land than this of growing it shy
on the land. Strange process the o'c
thoughtless might allege, but the ant
statement is true. Put all the com- Shb
mercial fertilizer you may on these ed
worn soils, it will be of little effect un
less there is humus in the soil to make Fie
it properly-assimilable and to open pre
the soil for the essential carbonic acid. an
Till the soil with humus, then every thi
pound of commercial mineral manure tie
applied will have its effect in increas- lad
ing the crop. It is so easy for the an
I southern farmer to restore humus to or
r his soil if he only appreciates the ne
eessity for doing so. He can restore so
1 humus, in fact without intermitting Ja
t his money crop-let that be what it to
might be.
L What a host of plants he has at his
f disposal-peas, Soja beans, Bur clover, bf
r Crimson clover, Sapling clover, Red ra
S clover, Japan clover, Melilotus, vetch, fie
e beggar weed! Why mention any more? La
One of the greatest crimes of the
a day committed chiefly against the re
farmer is the selling of seeds infertile w
d and worthless. It is quite possible Al
f that there are some very good people th
e who sell such goods ignorant of how Ge
Sworthless they are. Then again there ax
n are others who sell them knowing w
if they are old seeds and consequently in
) will not grow. There can hardly be sl
any worse crime against the purse of L
e our fellow-man. It is not so bad as ne
g selling adulterated medicine, but it is
i. worse than highway robbery. Our
a laws should deal severely with those
a who commit either of these crimes.
