“Planks and Platitudes” Give No Aid
GET BUSY CONGRESS!
Stubborn Battle Has Been Going On
Since December 3 —Much Secrecy
Surrounds Mellon Tax Reduction
Program to Suit Progressives.
(Department ot rumicauon anu
ucation)
WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. 28.
The present Congress, which has not
yet gotten down to real business, was
elected by the people a year ago last
November. Some fourteen months
have passed since the election and
business in the two Houses of Con
gress is just getting under way. In
fact, the Senate is not yet fully or
ganized.
This state of affairs, of course,
brings up the question of who is to
be the new chairman of the Senate
committee on interstate commerce.
The people are asking the question:
Will he be a Progressive or will the
Senate insurgents go over to the
Democrats and select a chairman
from the minority side of the cham
ber? Or will the Republicans give
in and elect Senator LaFollette of
Wisconsin, who is the ranking mem
ber of the majority party on that
committee? Or again let us sup
pose: Are we likely to have a com
promise candidate chosen?
In other words, what is to be the
outcome of the stubborn fight that
has been going on in the Senate since
Congress met on December 3 over
the selection of a chairman of the
committee that has to do with the
railroad legislation of the counry?
Action Called Horse Play
Senator Jim Reed of Missouri,
says this is all horse play, childish
maneuvers, this fight going on for
weeks and weeks over one chairman
ship. He advocates the committee
going ahead without a chairman,
saying that it does not make any dif
ference to the country who happens
to sit at the head of the committee
table and who sits at the sides of the
table.
On the other hand, Senator
Wheeler, the new Democratic sena
tor from Montana, says the people
of his state and other middle West
states, and especially the far North
western states, made the railroad
legislation of the last enactment a
campaign issue and fought out the
campaign on those lines. He says
the members of the Senate are fight
ing for a principle involved, a live
issue, if you please, and declares it
is not a child’s play by any means.
Senator Wheeler points to the fact
that every candidate who advocated
the retention of the Esch-Cummins
transportation law was defeated at
the polls in the last election and that
every candidate for the Senate who
advocated a repeal or a change in
the railroad legislation was elected.
He is of the opinion that the coun
try is watching this fight over this
important chairmanship and that it
is a most important scrap from every
standpoint. "
The Senate, therefore, can be said
to have done practically nothing up
to this time except to have agreed
upon other committees for the work
that is ahead. Everything is yet to
be done.
Rules Fight in the House
Over in the House end of the Capi
tol things are not much better and
there is fight on the rules
yet to come or is likely to happen.
It will be recalled that when the
House met early in December there
arose a deadlock situation over the
election of a speaker because of the
demand that was made for recogni
tion by the Progressives in that body.
Roll calls ensued for three days and
finally a truce was patched up by
which Speaker Gillett was chosen
and the House organized temporarily
for a period of thirty days. This pro
bationary period will expire about
the middle of January and there may
be another spectacular scrap over the
rules that are to govern the House
during the sixty-eighth Congress.
The Republicans made concessions
to the Progressive bunch and gave
the latter a place on the all-impor
tant rules committee by placing Rep
resentative Nelson of Wisconsin,
insurgent leader, on the committee
and then things began to run
smoothly for a short time. Just what
will be demanded by the Progres
sives when the big fight comes up in
THE VOICE OF MILITANT PROTESTANTISM OF THE NORTHWEST
me CALL of me NORTH
January remains to be seen.
Mellon’s Tax Reduction Program
The next turmoil came in the ways
and means committee of the House
over the tax reduction program of
Secretary Mellon and the proposed
bonus for the soldiers. Represent
ative Frear of Wisconsin, another in
surgent leader, led the fight for con
sideration of the bonus measure be
fore the tax reduction program was
taken up. This was voted down and
the Mellon measure was given the
right of way for consideration in the
committee.
The Mellon tax reduction program
has too much secrecy about it to sat
isfy most of the Progressive and
they are trying to smoke out the sec
retary of the treasury oh some things
they want to know. He has given to
the press and the public only the
things he wanted to get to them.
The committee on ways and means
of the House has the Mellon’program
in full, of course, but many of his
proposals for tax reduction on the
big things of life are not yet gener
ally known. Members of Congress
who do not happen to be on the ways
and means committee are just as
much in the dark yet about this as
is the public.
Getting Down to Business
The time has now come for Con
gress really to get down to brass
tacks and go to work with a ven
geance, and it is expected this will
be done beginning with next week
when Congress reassembles after the,
holidays recess. The session will be
a long one not ending probably be
fore the national conventions come
along in midsummer and, of course,
all parties are ambitious to make a
record so that they can go before
the country with issues, party plat
forms and party accomlishments.
All Klandom looks with interest
and waits for action.

WHEN THE BUM GOSSES
EDWARD YOUNG CLARK
The “bum” who rides the blind end
of the baggage car never “cusses” the
train crew until he gets thrown off;
then he cusses ’em, throws coal at ’em
—and walks to the next station.
Right here would be a good place
to stop our little comment in regard
to the notorious E. Y. Clark. The
analogy is complete. But here is an
other thought.
E. Y. Clark was Imperial Wizard
for a brief period after serving sev
eral months in charge of the promo
tion work. He was Imperial Wizard
just long enough for the membership
of the organization to find out what
he was—a moral leper. He was then
deposed and banished from the Order.
Like the ordinary “bum” who finds
himself deprived of conveyance, Clark
started to wreck the train which he
had been riding.
He has tried to make a fool of sev
eral persons, and seems now bent on
doing the same thing to President
Coolidge. And, as usual, it proves
a boomerang. Clark, under indict
ment on several counts for violation
of the Mann Act, writes an “open let
ter” to the President; making it pub
lic before it is read by the Executive.
Obviously this was done for the pur
pose of gaining publicity and nothing
more, but the publicity seems to have
misfired.
If Clark really does know of any
more men of his stripe who are
Klansmen, the Klan will be mighty
glad to have him make it public so
that they may be dealt with in the
same manner Clark was, but whether
they are thrown off now or later, the
big Klan train will continue on its
way; piloted by good, 100 per cent
Americans, and carrying several mil
lion of them as passengers.
Yes, Clark, it is a long walk to
the next station. You’ll be pretty
much worn out when you get there,
but throwing coal and “cussing” won’t
help matters any. You had no busi
ness trying to ride an honest mai/s
train; “that’s where you made your
first mistake.”—Jayhawker-AmericSn^
Too Much Secrecy
“Eternal Vigilance is the Price of Liberty”
ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 9, 1924
Talking Too Much
Some Klansmen should wear muzzles. Too many talk,
too many talk about lodge doings and proceedings. The
Know Nothings died out many years ago. When a man
joined that party in the ’4os he obligated himself to know
nothing—and, when asked as to who were members and
who were not, what had been done and what had not been
done, his answer was “I know nothing.” It was a mighty
good idea. Klaasmen may not know too much, but many
of them tell too much. Every Klansman is supposed to
keep his mouth shut, and to not talk out loud about what
is and what is not done in the organization. A good Klans
man will keep his mouth shut. This is the mark of a good
Klansman. Hear twice what you say. Remember your ob
ligation, and keep your mouth shut. Davy Oockett used
to say, “Pray to God and keep your powder dry.” We say
to Klansmen, “Pray to God and remember your obligation.”

KLAN VICTORY WON AT SPRINGFIELD
BY DISMISSAL OF CASE
Black Chapter in Persecution of American
Order Erased by Action of Prosecutor.
Springfield, Ohio. —The Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan have scored an
other decisive moral victory against
the un-American attacks made against
it and again the honor of the great
organization has been maintained.
After six months of delay and legal
juggling on the part of the police
and prosecutor, the case against sev
enty-two Klansmen arrested here July
6, when returning from the funeral
of a Klar.sman, was dismissed Sat
urday on motion of Prosecutor Justin
Altschul. No reason was given by
the prosecutor for requesting that the
case be nolled, and Police Judge
Davis made no comment in ordering
the case dismissed from the records.
Thus officially at least ends one of
the most peculiar cases in the his
tory of the local police department.
In the arrest of the Klansmen a
precedent was established as it is
the first time on record that the
members of a fraternal organization
were arrested while attending the
funeral of a brother.
The affair aroused nation-wide at
tention and many prominent secular
and fraternal publications took up
the discussion, and editorials con
demning the arrest were directed at
Richard E. O’Brien, chief of police,
and those responsible for the arrest.
In local circles it is doubtful
whether any public affair ever
aroused the sentiment of the citizens
as this arrest of the Klansmen and
within an hour later the imprison
ment of the Klansmen thousands of
citizens surrounded the county jail in
open protest to the injustice of the
affair.
Indignation was at high pitch and
but for the good judgment of Klan
attorneys and the peaceful and quiet
submission of the arrested Klans
men violence would no doubt have
resulted. Many of the Klansmen
themselves appealed to the citizens
to refrain from any demonstration
that would constitute disorder or dis
loyaly to the law.
It will be remembered that as a re
sult of this arrest the American flag
and the Holy Bible were placed in
i hereby take my pen in hand too
rite sumthin about this here Kluxin
bizness. im a member and guldurn
proud of it. my family are to only
wun of em wont admit it. my old
whit heded dad (nop he dont belong
but hes fur us) bax us an me but my
mau wunt admit nuthin, she sez so.
deep down in her hart she nose bet
ter but wimmen you no has an awful
time givin in. she started out thet
way an som day shes goin to Chang
an be a reglar american.
(Dont laff at my inglish cause i
aint niver had much chance at idica
tion but jest the same im fur the
right, i looked up thet word cause
i wants it to be oJc., when i noe its
right.
after id dun considerabul talkin
wun day maw lets loos and sez,
jail and the entire populace arose to
demand a restitution of this attro
cious insult.
Thirteen fraternal organizations
took up the fight in the city com
mission and pushed the fight until
Chief O’Brien, in order to save his
job, made a public apology to the
people of Sprinfield and promised
that never again would his depart
ment be guilty of arousing the dis
pleasure of Americans by such offi
cial procedure.
The case was continued once on
the request of Klan attorneys and
three times on motion of the prose
cution.
It is felt in local circles and so
expressed by the legal profession
here and elsewhere that the prosecu
tion had a hopelessly wobbly case
and that it would never come to
trial.
Prosecutor Altschul gave up hope
of the stability of his case when in
the great Klan demonstration here
September 8 the police failed to stop
the parade as they had pledged
themselves to do.
Several funerals have been held
since the arrest in July, when the
members marched through the streets
and no interference was made in any
instance by the police.
With the dismissal of the case
against the Klan it is felt that the
organization has thoroughly estab
lished itself in this city and that no
future efforts will be made to molest
or embarrass it.
It is estimated that the arrest of
the Klan funeral parade resulted in
the organization increasing its mem
bership by almost half.
When the announcement was made
that the Klansmen under bail were
released and that the case was dis
missed a feeling of satisfaction was
expressed and the opinions of thou
sands not connected with the organ
ization, that the Klan is a Christian,
law-abiding, American movement,
were solidly confirmed.
Chief of Police O’Brien, when asked
as to his opinion regarding the dis
missal of the case, declined to make
any statement.
FELLER CITIZENS:
“durnit! ef it wernt fur sech condi
shung there woodnt be no need of
eny Klan ap yu woodnt be in it.”
“maw,” sez i, “rite there yer admitin
sumthin.” an she sdz, “well mebe i

John do it has bin a slogan to long,
(i spec caus my names John the re
son i got to be in it an help or feel
ashamed of myself.) dont let John
do it but do it yurself.
Yurs til the Klan stops Kluxin,

DEPARTMENT INSTITUTED DY KLAN WILL
FURNISH TRUTHFUL INFORMATION
TO THE PUPLIC.
Washington, D. C. —Why the de
partment of publication and educa
tion?
The other day a politician, well
known in Indiana and even in the na
tion for his political sagacity, strat
egy, and at the same time subserv
ience to party politics, asked me the
question, in a Washington hotel:
“What the thunder and damnation is
the necessity for a bureau of pub
lication of the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan?”
It was obvious from his language
and his attitude that he was consid
erably “peeved,” and, answering him
in terms of votes—the only language
he could understand —V replied, in
substance, that in the past the folks
back home have only learned and
been able to know what you have told
them and you have told them what
was best for your interests and the
interests of those for whom you were
speaking.” The Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan have decided that the folks
back home are going to know the
truth about their government and
about those who conduct the business
of American government.
Klansmen, unlike the Baltimore
oriole which inherits its idea of build
ing a particular type of nest, and, un
like some other American people,
really have very definite mental
ability, are able to and intend to
figure things out for themselves from
now on. The infant child sucks by
instinct, and some folks eat peas with
a knife. Klansmen, as American vot
ers, are no longer going to vote blind-i
ly or by any sort of “instinct.”
To Gain Better Understandings
The department of publication and
education of the Klan, of course, does
not expect to confine itself to the
ideas propounded above and given to
the gentleman from Indiana, but this
was the language he undoubtedly
could understand. Seriously, and fun
damentlly, the department believes
the Klansmen do not aspire to a mod
ern Utopia but do desire to preserve
the existing level of patriotism and
public duty as they generally under
stand it and at the same time fur
nish to the American electorate edu
cation in the form of informaion per
taining to their government in order
that they may better undersand the
Kl:n, and at the same time inculcate
true ideals of operative patriotism
and citizenship in the minds of all
American people as they, the Klans
men, understand it.
Custom, traditions, institutions, po-
litical precedents, history, education,
all clamor for a definite and intelli
gent line of Americanism which they
may follow, and it is this resource
fulness and indomitable spirit, the
challenging and even pugnacious at
titude of the Klansmen of America
that is going to be the basis for
searching out the unseen forces that
govern America; and facts pertaining
to government and finances and tax
ation; searching out and equalizing
the control of our economic situation,
particularly as it affects farm prod
ucts and food products; what partic
ular agencies control our civic confl
munities, and what particular system
it is that is throttling the upbuilding
of our common school sysem; what
/Can be done toward the Americaniza
tion of foreigners and aliens now
here, and compel stoppage of new
comers until this problem has been
solved, are Klansmen viewpoints,
that, if worth anything, will stand the
test of American public opinion.
An environment and machinery for
the distribution of these facts has
been established, and the American
public by their response to the Klan
doctrine, millions in number during
1923, are now strong for the supreme
act, the building of an organization
different from that ever known be
fore—and better, the rendering of
the greatest possible service to all
mankind. 1
Really Distinctive Points
These are, in fact, the really dis
tinctive points about the Klan and
the bureau. They will work for law
enforcement, better education, bet
ter government, or any of the other
fundamental ideals for which the
Klan aims, but the initiation of their
principles and the preaching of their
doctrine is the essential thing.
There are myriads of other orgaili
zations who think and practice some,
and even all, of those fundamentals,
but only in the Klan will be found
the program and the very form of
organization based exclusively on
Americanism in all the word implies.
The Klan is simply going beyond
the rest of America in dealing with
ideas; with the ideas that the coun
try is suffering much from unassimi
lated immigration; that there is too
much action by racial and religious
groups; that attempts are being made
to destroy the fundamental ideas of
Americanism, and that the Klan it
self, the greatest forward movement
of the world, has been driven for
ward and carried to its present suc
cess by just these ideas.
Another service of the department
is that coming under an economic
head, and is based on the fact that
there is' widespread dissatisfaction
among the farmers and that nothing
really constructive has been, or is be
ing done, for them, especially the na
tive American farmer. To my po
litical friend, when we discussed the
farm problem, I called to his atten
tion that he and his particular group
had given to the farmer only “planks
and platitudes;” that the American
farmers were seeing their children
forced into occupations they detested;
that their schools were being invaded
by teachers they distrusted; that their
Sabbaths were being violated; that
their laws were being broken almost
with impunity; that they were being
driven to meet the competition and
methods wholly controlled by alien in
fluences, and that somewhere deep
down and far back in the machinery
of government was some influence
that wa§ making it mighty “hard go
ing for the average farmer.”
Planks and Platitudes
Whereas my political friend from
Indiana would render them planks
and platitudes, the Klan proposes to
give them truthful and unbiased in
formation on the economic prob
lems upon which their troubles are
fundamentally predicted. An elab
orate research bureau now in
stalled in Washington and well un
der operation has been and is search
ing out the facts for presentation to
them as a service rendered by the
Klan without thought of reward or
personal gain. Incidentally this par
ticular bureau is compiling at this
time a card index record of every sin
gle act of every single individual
member now in Congress and like
wise the acts of the different depart
ment heads, and these records would
be available to Klansmen and other
honest seekers as a guidance to them
in the development of the militant
Americanism and operative patri
otism.
The Klan is going into action
against all forces that are crowding
America to the wall simply by main
taining a Christian civilization in
America. Americanism is going to
be understandable by all those who
read and think, and Americanism is
the Klan’s supreme objective. Who
ever knows what it is and whoever
fights for it, no matter what his or
her origin or other characteristics,
are among the forces for which the
Klan depends for the success of the
principles and the doctrines of Klan
craft.
As recently referred to by an emi
nent journalist, they are “the ideals
and the aspirations of the most aver
age men in America.”
With its research department, with
its editorial writers on the most vital
subjects in American welfare, with
its state editors and state news
gathering organization, all function
ing under the bureau, the Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan intend to render
what they believe is one of the
greatest services ever rendered to
American citizenship. With many
million Klansmen supporting them
whole-heartedly and unreservedly and
with millions of American citizens
looking on, and in general in sym
pathy with these principles, no one
doubts the necessity for, nor the ulti
mate success of the project itself.
Secrecy Is Discussed
There is a lot of agitation and con
siderable conversation in Washington
concerning the secrecy of the Klan.
$2.00 A YEAR. 6c A COPY
and it is amazing how the average
citizen in Washington really in a
measure generally accepts funda
mentally the principles of the organ
ization. The average Washingtonian,
however, can hardly understand the
secrecy, yet they are living in an at
mosphere of the most damnable sec
recy this side of Russia.
It has been necessary to point out
to some of them that in early days
of an organization which is putting
forward any strong doctrine or pro
gram new and controversial, there is
danger of retaliation against indi
vidual members which may destroy
the organization. When it becomes
stronger this danger becomes less and
as a better understanding of the or
ganization grows the danger of the
crucifixion of the individual members
also grows less. This is proven by
the attitude of the press today and
by the earlier attacks on the Klan
and Klansmen physical as well as
oral.
The Klan may be out in the open
one of these days. It will make pub
lic its membership at any time that
those forces that are throttling Amer
ican ideals and diluting our American
citizenship and living under their
own interpretation, if they have any,
of the Constitution, will come into the
spotlight o£ American publicity and
reveal their intentions, their purposes,
their motives, and when legislation is
made all-including on its purpose.
This applies to political as well as
religious and fraternal organizations.
Moreover, there are great advan
tages and a great increase of effec
tiveness through secrecy in such an
organization. A force which is in the
open and can be seen and called upon.

Congress Scheduled to Get Into Ac
tion During Latter Part
of Week
—K-K-K
Washington, D. C.—The Senate
committee on privileges and elec
tions has not turned a wheel this
week owing to the absence of so
many members of Congress from the
city. Most of them are spending the
week at their various homes through
out the country and will not be back
in the Capital city until the first of
next week. Congress is scheduled to
reassemble on January 3 and then
things will begin to hum for the re
mainder of the long session—maybe.
At the office of Senator Spencer,
chairman of the Senate committee
on privileges and elections, it is
learned that the subcommittee ap
pointed to consider the evidence in
the contested Mayfield case is sub
ject to the call of the chairman. As
Senator Spencer is out of the city
for the remainder of this week it is
not believed the call for a meeting
of the subcommittee will be sent out
until some time next week. Before
leaving Washington for the holidays,
leaving Washington for the holidays,
Senator Spencer said he would call
the subcommittee together early in
January, and get the Mayfield case
started as early as possible, as he
was anxious to take up the case at
once and dispose of it as soon as pos
sible.
To Hold Hearings
The subcommittee that is to held
hearings in the Mayfield case and go
over the evidence presented is made
up of Senators Spencer of Missouri,
chairman; Ernst of Kentucky, Greene
of Vermont, Republicans; and Nee
ley of West Virginia and King of
Utah, Democrats.
It is thought by some that this
subcommittee may go to Texas for
some of its hearings in this case, as
most of the witnesses will come from
the Lone Star state. It is said none
of them will be adverse to a “jaunt
into Texas,” and those interested in
Mayfield sincerely hope the commit
tee makes the trip. They feel that
the general “tone” and “Klan atmos
phere” In Texas will only tend to
strengthen the well-established fact
that Senator Mayfield was sent to
Washington by the best citizens of
Texas at a ratio of 3 to 1 over those
interests who now oppose him on
purely a Klan issue.
