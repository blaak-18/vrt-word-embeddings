We were on Mr. Henry Anders
farm Monday, and found him busy
working out the largest crop of
corn he has had for many years,
having nr duced his cotton crop to
some extent.
Mc. K. Holston wi.,hes to notify
the public that be keeps on hand a
full line of coffins at lowest prices.
Coffins formerly sold at I'.00 will
now be sold at $7.(O. and those
sold at $15.00 will be sold for $13.
Childrens sizes from $5.00 up.
All orders will be attended to
promptly.
Don't forget when you need
anything in his line to give him
your orders.
We have seen many crops on
our beautiful Cane river this week,
and we are firmly convinced that
it is the best country in the world
for the farmer.

Once upon a tine' a ma'i die,-.
aind went to the gate of heaven to
. let in. St. Peter cant to tohe geat,
and askel him hiis namue. 1l1 told
it, and St. Peter looking all througIh
0 the books of life, :laid he coul',I tint
find the name of the man. The
lean seeimled sturpiised andi asked
. St. Peter to look again for surely
he must have overlooked it, and
Ilbegan to tell hiii aboutl what a
good fellow he had been on earth;
that he had always attendedi churcth.
Said the preacher, the do1oicr, th'.

ed surprisedI now anil called atll an
gel and told him to bring t he book
of works as there must be some
mistake here, as this man's name
was not found in the book of life.
The aitr:l awent and returned with

which the lmuta lived and Peter

Government Ownership of lRal
roads.
The Populist party platform is
in favor of the government owner
ship of railroads. This is no new
idea, as government ownership of
railroads is as old as the railroads
themselves. Germany owns 23,
285 miles, Austro-lHungary 7,s(Ht,
Italy 8,110, Belgium 3,000, British
India, 8,423. Portugal, Denmark,
Norway, Roumania, Russia, Japan,
Egypt, The Cape Colonies, Port
Natal, New South Wales, Victo
ria, Tasmania, New Zeland, South
Australia, Queensland, West Aus
tralia, Argentine Republic, Brazil
and Canada own railroads. The
railroads of Germany turned into
the State treasury in 1891 $250,
(00X,000. The cost of construct
ing and maintaining railroads in
Germany greatly exceeds the cost
of the same in this country. More
men are employed in operating
German railroads. The equip
ment and speed of trains are su
perior to our roads. The accom
modations are better, the lives of
passengers safer, and freight and
passenger rates much less. The
government saves millions annual
y in the transportations of mail,
troops and supplies for the army
and navy, which under our system
goes to swell the receipts of cor
porations. That railroads can be
operated under government owner
ship and controlled more economi
cay no one will attempt to deny.
For metance American railroads
expend annually $18,000,000 for
president's salaries. Thirty mil
lions could be saved by doing away
with pass to politicians andc priv
i classes, $20,000,000 saved by
abrogating the commission system,
$20,000,000 by consolidating routes,
depots and stals, $4,000,000 by dis
bandang traflc associations, $15,
000,000 by abolishing the solicitor
ystem, $5,000,000 advertising,
10,00oo,000on printing, 30,000
000 on corruption fund, $50,000,
000 on rebates sad trusts, combina
tion ad favored shipiers, $150,
000,000 m dividends, besides hun
dreds of millions paid by the gov
ernment for carrying the mails,
troops, army and navy supplies,
mileage for senators, congressmen,
itu Sta marshals and govern
ment empoyes. Under govern
meat eontrol paeeeger. ad freight
rates could be reducd half and our
system of railroads made self sus
tiaining and beoome a source of
rmen, to the government as they
are in Germay ad Rssia. WitI

be purchased or constructed with
the earnings the service seemed to
demand without issuing bonds or
taxing the Ipeople. Under govern
ment ownership there would be no
more strikes and rids. The trav
cling public would not suffer the
inconvenient experience of the past.
As the memorable strike on the
C. B. & Q. some years past and
the strike in Chicago of last year
are still remrmnbered by every one.
And a repetition of which no sane
person would wish to see. Gov
ernment ownership is the only per
mnanont remedy. Let the govern
ment reduce passenger and freight
rates one half and the volume of
businers done by the railroad in
this country would et lipse anything
ever witnessed in the history of the
world.

Let us corner up the fsnnwbanms
Lying all around our path;
Get a trust on wheat and roses.
Give the poor the thorns and chaff.
Let us find our chiefest pleasure
Hoarding bounties of to-day,
8o the poor shall have scant measure
And two prices have to pay.
Yes, we'll reservoir the rivers,
And we'll levy on the lakes,
And we'll lay a trifling toll-tax
On each poor man who partakes ;
We'll brand his number on him
That he'll carry through his life;
We'll apprentice all his children,
Get a mortgage on his wife.
We will capture e'ven the wind-god,
And confiue him in a cave;
And then, through our pateat process.
We the atmosphere will save;
Thus we'll squeeze our little brother
Whe' he tries his lungs to fill,
Put a meter on his wind-pipe
And present our little bill.
We will syndicate the starlight,
And monoplize the moon!
Claim a royalty on rest days,
A proprietary noon;
For right of way through ocean's spray
We charge just what it's worth;
We'll drive our stakes around the lakee-
In fact, we'll own tlh, earth.
