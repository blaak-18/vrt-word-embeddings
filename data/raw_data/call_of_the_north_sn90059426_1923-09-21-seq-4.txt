messengers on motorcycles will have
special duties. Outposts will be main

purpose of handling the immense
crowd, minimizing danger of accidents
as well as to prevent intrusion by
hoodlums, and is under instruction to

under the surveillance of the patrol.
Complete arrangements have been
made for transportation over the Mil

Once upon a time there was a man named Om —some
< folks called him “Twilight.”
He used to stand out on the corner in some small town
and whisper a few words to the people, who gathered
around to hear what he had to say. He did not dare to speak
out loud for fear the people in the next town might hear
him and there might be some one there in that next town
trying to talk to the people.
So all the people would gather up close, within three or
four blocks, and he would just whisper his message to them.
Now there is a mayor in one town not far from St. Paul who
says that this Orn cannot speak in his town. He has heard
stories of this Orn with the great big voice, and fear is
within the man, you bet, he’s afraid this Orn, might forget
and speak right out loud.
Listen children, this little town is called Stillwater and
there is a river runs right through it and it’s wet —and if
this Orn with the voice of thunder should speak out loud,
the water would be no longer still, and there would be no
Reilly water either, nor would there be any holy water left
in Stillwater, that is, not much.
And one more thing children, there’d be no still in
Stillwater. What then would some of the people do?
But this Orn, with his big, big voice is going to Still
water, not to stay very long, but long enough to speak right
out loud.
Won’t that be fun children, and then won’t Mr. Orn be,
OH! —So happy.

Williams, Ariz.—Although the Klan
meetings in this section of the coun
try are not attended in such great
gatherings of people as in the more
populous sections of the country, they
make up in enthusiastic adherence to
the cause what they may lack in num
bers. At a recent open air meeting
on the mountain side near here a
number of candidates were initiated,
the wives being stationed at a con
venient distance from whence they
could see the workings of the Klan.
A large cross was burned, which
could plainly be seen in Williams.

—K-K-K
Pittsburgh, Pa.—Plans are being
made by the Roman Catholics of this
section to organize the Knights of the
Flaming Circle, declared by its organ
izers to be the foe of the Ku Klux
Klan. The new secret organization
does not confine its membership to
Irish Roman Catholics or even to Ro
man Catholics, but also welcomes
Jews and negroes as members. Mem
bers of Protestant churches are not
eligible for membership. The Flam
ing Circle Knights is an avowed anti-
Klan organization and countenances
violence only as a means of self-de
fense.
All of the societies composed of for
eigners have been invited to join the
new organization. It is understood
the Knights of Columbus are giving
the attempt to found the new order
every encouragement.
During their initiation ceremonies
the Knights of the Flaming Circle
wear only masks. Each knight has
a flaming circle over his heart, sym
bolic, the organizers say, of truth. As
offiicers of the new order wear robes,
the name “Red Knights” has been
adopted in making the distinction be
tween societies where white robes are
worn.

ON TOP OF ALLEGE ANIES
Demonstration Would Have Been Vis

Keyser, W. Va.—The Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan burned a cross on
the crest of the Alleghanies last week,
the largest ever seen in this part
of the country. It was located 3,327
feet above the level and 2,418 feet
higher than the city of Keyser. The
cross was approximately 50 feet high
with wide cross arms.
The last dynamite signal was se
vere enough to have shattered win
dows for half a mile. Heavy clouds
somewhat obstructed the view from
Keyser. With favorable conditions
this cross could have been seen for
40 miles.

KLAN WINS IN MAINE
ELECTION RESULTS IN BIG
KLAN YICTORY FOR OFFICE;
BETTER CIVIC GOVERNMENT
Portland, Me.—The peril of the Ku
Klux Klan has made its appearance
in the state of Maine. It was so
much in evidence at .the local election
here this week as to cause cold shiv
ers to run down the spines of the
local political bosses who have been
running the city for the past few
its first victory in the fight to obtain
good government or civic affars.
Plan No. 8, as it is termed, for a
new city charter, which was backed
by the Klan, and also very largely
by the women voters, was adopted
by a majority of 2,347 votes. As a
result .the old form of government,
which has done duty for 91 years,
will go out of existence January 1.
In place of a mayor and council,
Portland will be governed by a, com
mission of five and city manager, who
may be imported from any part of
the state.
The victory for the knights of
darkness was .totally unexpected up
until the time the votes were counted.
The election brought out an un
usually heavy vote, but there was ev
ery indication up to 6 o’clock that
the supporters of plan 1 were hold
ing their own.
As ward after ward was counted
the old guard stared in amazement.
Not only had the Klan and its friends
carried their own wards, eight and
nine, but they took a number of the
others.
Mayor Carrol S. Chaplin, whose de
fiance of the Klansmen evidently was
instrumental in his defeat, issued a
statement shortly after the returns
were learned.
“It is apparent that the citizens of
Portland desire a change,” he said.
“As the last of its long line of
mayors I am prepared .to bid farewell
to the traditions of 91 years, and with
the welfare of my native city still at
heart, to cheerfully resume my place
in the ranks and lend every assist
ance to a fair trial of the new charter
in accordance with the public will.”
City officials, who will probably lose
their positions as the result of the
election, are not inclined to make any
public statements. As they were
mostly opposed to the active interest
taken by the Klan and the women
voters in the election, it is but natural
that they do not have very much to
say at the present time. City Clerk
Frank Welch philosophically says,
•“It seems to be the will of .the peo
ple,” which sentiment is endorsed ov
erwhelmingly by the Klan, the wo
men voters, and nearly all the solid
citizens of Portland.
ST. PAUL KLAN MEETS
UNDER DRIPPING SKIES
The St. Paul Klan met as usual
last Monday night under dripping
skies and initiated a large class of
candidates with appropriate cere
monials. A display of fireworks was
added to the usual ritual making the
work more impressive. This was the
last and most successful open-air
meeting of St. Paul organization this
year.
The feature of the meeting was the
fact that the first two hundred men
in St. Paul Klan were the guests of
honor. The strange thing about it
was that all the “Old Timers” who
talked to us that evening were mak
ing plans for the future and were
not recalling the past, showing that
progress is being made in Klankraft
which is essentially a forward look
ing science, always building for the
future.
On account of the rain the meet
ing was not so well attended as
would have been the case had the
weather been good, but according to
press reports was attended by 500
men, all enthusiastic devotees of
Klankraft.
The address of the evening was
made by the Grand Dragon of the
Realm of Minnesota and was given
to a discussion of the Oklahoma sit
uation, and matters within the or
ganization.
Altogether it was the most enthu
siastic meeting of the year and no
doubt but what St. Paul Klan will
continue its rapid growth and de
velopment.
