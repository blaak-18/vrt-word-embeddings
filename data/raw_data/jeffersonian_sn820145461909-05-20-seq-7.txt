CLASS LEGISLATION.
With the varied and almost limit
less resources of this country ami the
possibility of an abundant produc
tion of everything necessary for the
inaiiutenance and (happiness of the
human family, there is no excuse for
a pauper class or an illiterate class
on American soil, and the sad fact
that we have the distressingly poor
artd illiterate by the millions,
and the dangerously rich by the
thousands, is a burning shame and an
everlasting disgrace to American
statesmanship;
When we Cali to mlild the fact that
the poor are of the class who, by the
sweat of their faces, . produced the
enormous wealth of the country, and
that the rich are of the non-produc
ing class, the aspect is rendered more
revolting. We are told by the bene
ficiaries of special privilege, and
their hired tools, that legislation has
nothing to do with making paupers
of one class or millionaires of an
other class. But we notice that the
authors of the argument maintain an
army of lobbyists and expert boodlers
whose business is to meet with legis
lative bodies and buy legislation at
any old price.
One of the strangest coincidents of
the times is that they can buy legisla
tion which enables them to relieve
the producer of his products without
just remuneration, get into the
courts, which make it a matter of
public record, and still make their
victims believe the treacherous argu
ment that legislation has nothing to
do with the distribution of wealth.
It would seem rather uncharitable
to-size up the majority of our people
as idiots, but when one reflects se
riously upon the manner in which
they vote their oppressors into power,
it is difficult to keep away from such
conclusion.
Our demo-republicratic banking
system, based as it is upon a per
petual interest bearing national debt,
and giving to the bankers the power
to control the money volume, inflate
or contract the currency, create a
money stringency or panic at will,
would bankrupt the masses of any
country under the sun. Its blasting
effects can not be overcome by in
dustry and frugality. The bonds are
issued to mature after the interest
has doubled the debt, and at ma
turity they are generally refunded
in full or in part to double again.
In July, 1907, $110,000,000 in bonds
fell due. The Secretary of the Treas
ury announced in advance that he
w’ould pay off half the debt and re
fund the other half into 30-year 4
per cent bonds. Os course that debt
■had already doubled on the people
one time, if not twice, and now half
of it is refunded to more than dou
ble again. At the time this corrupt
deal was consummated there was in
the treasury a surplus of $171,000,-
000. This surplus was so annoying
to the Secretary that he relieved his
mind by turning it over to the bank
ers without interest. It is highly
probable that the bankers who got
the money were the owners of the
refunded bonds. Os course, there
isn’t a man in the government who
would' renew his mortgage to run
thirty years when he had a cash sur
plus on hand more than sufficient to
pay off the debt and then let his
neighbor have the surplus without
interest. Why let our agents do a
’business of that kind for us? But
when we remember that secretaries
of the treasury are appointed upon
the recommendation of the Bankers’
Association, we should not be sur
prised that bankers practically have
control of the Treasury.

THE GRAVE YARD.
(Near a Country Church.)
Thro’ shadows peering with eerie
eyes.
While tinlhallowed ghostly fumes
arise
Like fitful mists, thro’ the lonely
dell,—
And shrieking laughter, from the
depths of hell,
Breaks the wall of silence down—
Reverberates the hills and vales
around!
Yet, horrid specters dance in glee,
As 'the cold moon glimmers o’er the
lea,
And shout, —till sleepers awake in
fright,
Shiver and timidly peer out at the
night,
Mutter ’and 'return to their lowly
bed;
“Alas!” moan they, 11 ’tis a night
of the dead!”
—J. Thomas Wright.
REFORM NEEDED IN OUR
CHURCHES.

My Dear Sir: Please send me
April Magazine. Find stamps en
closed. Except for this number, I
have an unbroken file, beginning
with first issue of the New York
magazine. This number was too
good to let stop. It has been on the
go until it is worn out. I wish
every man and woman in America
could read it. It proves just what I
haive been contending for twelve
years, —-I mean, of course, this for
eign missionary fraud. I was ac
cused ten years ago of being an in
fidel because I contended that the
preachers, as a rule, were making
fools of us just because it paid them
to make us fools. I can add nothing
•to what you have said on this sub
ject. You have thoroughly covered
the ground, but allow me to say that
I believe, or I may say am absolutely
convinced, that of all the Trusts that
are crushing the life out of us, the
Preachers’ Trust is the greatest, for,
according to them, it is almost, if not
quite, impossible for a poor man to
be saved.
All honor to the man Who is preach
ing for the good of humanity, and
because it is his duty to preach. No
one would be quicker than I to help
hold up his hands; no one more ready
to help care for him and his family,
where there was necessity for such
‘help; but show me one who is
preaching for a salary, and I will
show you one who is hired by the
devil. In my humble judgment, a
salaried ministry is largely responsi
ble for this missionary fraud, as well
as most other frauds, and in my opin
ion you are just pow beginning to
©!?< 3tffersontan
strike at the fountain head. 1 have
not believed for a long while that
we can ever bring about much real
reform until there is some reforma
tion in the churches, and we will
never get that till we wake up to
the fact that we are being badly
humbugged by them. Just look at
the sort of preaching we have. In
one breath they tell us that God is
all-wise, all-powerful, or, in other
words, that He really is God; and in
the next breath they make him a lit
tle, weak, jnsjignificant thing, who
can’t save a sinner without the
devil’s help; and we, who read and
think a little for ourselves, and then
dare differ with them, are considered
as being the very imps of hell, but
they will ’beg us imps for money
harder than a tramp ever begged for
bread, or a poor starving laborer for
work. Actually call on the devil to
help run the Lord’s business.
I wouldn’t have taken this much
of your time, but I see you are having
some time to spare by the way you
are amusing yourself with Scoville
and other little fellows like him.
I remain faithfully yours,
Geo. T. Wilson.

Dear Sir: I am a Populist, and
have been for several years, and
■there are plenty more Populists in
our neighborhood. Four hundred
voters in our county stayed ait home
on election day because they had no
body to vote for. In four years we
want a full ticket, State and county.
Yours for success,

CONCERNING FOREIGN MIS
SIONS.

Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Friend: Enclosed please find
sl. renewal for weekly.
I have come across a sour preacher,
on account of the missionary. edi
torials ‘that 'have appeared in the
Jeffersonians from time to time.
Now, to me those editorials are the
best religious sauce that I ever dip
ped my spiritual battercake in. I
have never heard of those who do the
contributing, and otherwise foot the
bills, calling Mr. Watson a dis
gruntled politician. Such epithets
only come from the recipients,—from
those who live and grow fat off the
people’s misplaced confidence and
generosity. It’s an old saying that
“charity ’begins at home,” and that
holds good in religion, or should hold
good. I asked the preacher referred
to above if he bad read Mr. Wat
son’s missionary articles; he said,
1 ‘ No. ’ ’ Then I asked, ‘ 1 How do you
condemn without knowing?” “I
heard another say.” I replied,
“Hearsay is not good evidence.
Read for yourself, and you will find
the columns of the Jeffersonian open
to your reply.” I intend to show
him what Mr. Watson really did say.
Yours truly,
J. B. Howard.
