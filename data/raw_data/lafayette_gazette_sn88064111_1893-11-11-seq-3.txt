TOWN AND( COUNTRY.
Mr, Albert Delahoussaye spent
last week in, New Orleans, and Son
day went over to Opelousas.
After visiting HaHlsville, Texas,
and Shreveport, La., Mrs. F. Dema
made returned home Sattirday:
Our jovial young friend Rodolphe
Domengeaux, of Royville, dropped
in on The Gazette for a few minutes
chat Sunday.
Mr. Wallace H. Frisbie, business
mnanager of "Grimes' Cellar Door"
Comedy company gave The Gazette
a pleasant call Tuesday.
We noticed in a Times-Democrat
special, Wednesday, from Washing
ton that Mr. Chas. Lusted, Sr., of
this town has had issued to him a
patent on a grass cutting attachment.
Miss Ines Broussard, of St. Mar
tinsville, who hadbeen Visiting Mr.
and Mrs. J. G. Braussard, departed
for home this week, Mrs. Broussard
accompanying her, and will spend a
few days in that town.
But one case came up before the
Court of Appeals at its sitting Tues
day, being the case of E. H. Vor
d.nbauman vs. Jamieson et als. on
t !e question of a boundary line.
The judgmeht of the lower court,
which was in favor of the plaintiffs,
was amended and affirmed.
Mr. Jeff McBride, who has a num
b r of brothers and other kin in this
p Irish, died in Franklin Wednesday.
Death is believed to have resulted
from a fall, from a house, in which
he sustained, it appears, severe in
ternal injuries.
Two parties, one of 75 and the
other of zoo men, and part of the
California unemployed workingmen
now heading for Louisiana, the ulti
mate destination being New Orleans,
passed through Lafayette, the
former crowd Sunday, and the other
Thursday.
As a token of love and respect
the children of the Mount Carmel
Convent schools presented their
pastor, the Rev. Forge, this week, a
fine silk umbrella, as well as other
evidences of their regard, on the oc
casion of the anniversary of his fete.
Cards are out announcing the ap
proaching nuptials of Mr. Alfred
Mouton and Miss Alix Judice. The
ceremony will take place at the Ca
tholic Church of this town on the
15th instant, at 5 o'clock p. m. The
Gazette acknowledges receipt of an
invitation.
Judges Perrault and ex-j'idge
Lewis from Opelousas, passed
through Lafayette Sunday on their
way to Crowley, the former to pre
side over, and the latter to attend,
a session of the District Court,
which convened Monday.
James B. Mackie is well and favorably
remembered for his clever work as ,"Grimesey
Me Boy" in a "'Bunch of Keys," which part
he played successfully for four seasons. His
present work as "Billy Grimes" in the mu
sical camedy, "'Grimes' Cellar Door," is by
far the best he has ever done and firmnnly
established him an original comedian of many
accomplishnents. Falk's Opera House,
Monday night, Nov. 13.
Lafayette "did herself proud" in
her contribution towards the storm
sufferers. Of the amounts taken up
in the catholic churches in the coun
try. under call of the archbishop,
Lafayette stands secoffd with $142. 25
to her credit. In securing this
handsome total, the disinterested ef
forts of Mesdames Mouton and
Monnier contributed a fair share.
As "Grimesey Me Boy" in A Bunch o
Keyes," James B. Mackie the accomplished
young comedian was simply inimitable, but
as "Billy Grimes," who owns the Cellar
Door in the new and original musical comedy
entitled "'Grimes Cellar Door," he has a
part that fits him to a nicety and one in
which his many talents shine even brighter
than in his former success. His supporting
company is said to bean unusually stong one.
Falk's Opera House, Monday night, Nov.l3.
Mr. Alcide V. Mouton, aged 45
years and so months, died near Ca
rencro Monday, and Tuesday his
mortal remains were followed to
their last resting place by a large
concourse of friends and relatives,
thus demonstrating the esteem in
which he was held. Mr. Mouton
was a man of sterling qualities,
and charitable to a fault. He leaves
a wife and ten children, and a host
of friends to mourn his untimely
demise, and to' whom The Gazette
tenders its sympathy, in their great
loss.
Henry E. Dixey's first partner was
James B. Mackie. They used to
practice dancing together on an old
cellar door in South Boston, hence
the title of "-Grimes Cellar Door"
for the musical comedy in which
Mackie is now starring with marked
s,Ceess. Falk's Opera House, Mon
day night, Nov.. a.

The great out-door field of tented Enter

but two managements, and Sells Brothers
are "equal partners" in the division. In fact
in the exclusive possession of many rare
creatures and noted performers, they hold
first place, and their visit, to Lafayette on
Thtrsday, Nov. 23, is surpassingly rich in
well-founded promises of elaborate and en
joyable entertainment. Their Roman Hip

Menagerie, Triple Circusses, Tropical Aqua

Superb Fairyland Street Parade, contain
more than enough strange sights, thrilling
races, sensational acts and glowing pageants
for a whole carnaval week. Nor does mere
quantity banish quality from .the colossal

are not to be found elsewhere. Thmcoliseum

to score hits and are always encored to the

Nov. 13.
Rev. Father Hlealey has been
placed in charge of the catholic par
ish of Centreville and Patterson,
and leaves to-day for his new field
of labor. Father Healey has been
in Lafayette for the past four years
and by his kindness of heart, affa
bility, and Christian teachings has
endeared himself, not only to his
flock, but possess the esteem of the
whole population, irrespective of
religious beliefs. While it is with
extreme regret we note his depart
ure, we extend congratulations on
his promotion to a curateship. The
best wishes of The Gazette will ever
follow him.
The Favorite base ball club of
this town and a nine from Opelou
sas, crossed bats on the Carencro
grounds last Sunday. After playing
five innings, with the score standing
9 to 7 in favor of Opelousas, the
I.afayette boys quit the field, claim
ing that the umpire was giving them
the worst in his dicisions. Ti e
captain of the Favorites offered to
play the same club for a purse of
$1oo or more; game to be played in
Lafayette, with a disinterestcd
umpire. The captain of the Opelou
sas nine has the matter under. con
sideration.
The Carencro Fair.
Owing to a press of engagements
which could not be deferred, The
Gazette, much to its regret, could
not attend the fair in Carencro;
and our "old reliable" correspon
dent failing to send in his weekly
contribution, which we had hoped
would contain a full account of the
the affair, places us in the unfortu
nate and regrettable predicament of
being unable to mention the fair in
the manner we should have wished.
However, from parties in this town
who were in attendance, we learn
with pleasure that it was a decided
success-socially and financially.
But this was to be expected, inas
much as the people of our progres
sive sister town never does things
by halves. While we do not posi
tively know the amount, we under
stand that much over Stooo was re
alized. Those from this town who
attended speak in the highest praise
of the arrangements and admirable
manner in which every detail was
carried out.
Caommunicated.l
A Beloved Pastor.
Rev. Father Healey, who had been as
sistant priest of Lafayette parish, for three
years and to months, was appointed Pastor
of Pattersonville and left this week to take
charge of his new parish.
His departure spread a gloom over our
little community. During his sojourn in our
midst, his kind and anliable disposition won
him the love and esteem of his parishoners.
Kind and Indulgent to children, he had won
their affection; he loved the duty of visiting
among the sick and poor, and none could
more ably console the needy.
In the absence of our beloved pastor,
Rev. Father Forge, he had charge of the
parish. His unwearied zeal for our spiritual
welfare, during these few months, will ever
claim our fondest affection and gratitude.
No one knew him, or came under his priest
ly influence, but regrets his going, and he
carries with him their best wishes. May suc
cess crown his efforts.
Let us hope that he will find in his new
parish, the respect and esteem that he leaves
in Lafayette. D. F.

elections. Simply wonldering "Rhere

and most esteemed gentleman, Mr. Simonet
Leblanc of Lake Peigneur. Mr. Leblanc
is the oldest and most influential citizen of
his section and bears the honor of being the
father of the large Leblanc family of Bayou
Tigre. This pleasant and entertaining old
gentleman of 72 years of age, and anyone
not knowing him could hardly give him 63.

ranging from 35 to 52 years and weighing

an old anti-bellum "gig," which was highly
enjoyed by The Gazette man.

Will you be so kind as to do me the favor
to send a sample copy of your paper. I in

buy land if the country suits me, and others

This is the fourth request that
we have received, and complied
with, in as many weeks. Our only
regret is that we did not have any
printed matter descriptive of
our great manifold resources
to forward, at the same time.

be too much to undertake single

arrangements, to bring the lands be
