Judgo Black cn the Louisiana Contro
versy—A Crucial Letter.
[From the Baltimore Sun.]
Hon. Jeremiah S. Black, of Penneylva
nia, has written a letter to the New York
Herald criticising both Reverdy Johnson
and Charles O'Connor's letters on the sub
ject of President Grant's action in the
Louisiana case, in which he holds that the
President committed a grave violation of
his constitutional duty, both in the first in
stance in sustaining Dirndl in favor of the
installation of the pretender Kellogg, and
in reinstating Kellogg alter his expulsion
by the rightful government of the State
under McEnery. He says :
"The state is that which stands. Its
government is 'the powers that be ' Its
officers are those who actually exercise its
authority. It is, therefore, the call of the
de, facto government that tho President
must respond to. This principle pervades
all law, municipal and international, and
its observance is absolutely necessary to
tho preservation of our domestic tranquili
ty, as tho peace of the world. If tho Pre
sident assists a faction hostilo to tho ex
isting government, with the intent to
drive tho incumbent magistrates from the
seat of power, be excites domestic violence
and makes iusurrêctiou, instead of sup'
pressing it.
"Tho facts of tho Louisiana case, I think
they are universally understood since the
publication of Mr. Carpenter's report, are
these:- A man named Kellogg aspired to
be Governor, but wholly failed of the elec
tion. Nevertheless, ho claimed the office
on grounds which were not only false and
fraudulent, but absurd. He had no show
of a case before tho proper authorities,
whose duty it was to decide contested elec
tions ; but he laid his claim before a fed
eral judge, who made an order for his in
stallation, This order was as destitute of
all legal forces or validity, as if it had
been made by the lirst negro that Kellogg
might have picked np in tho street. I
take it for granted the .judge and all tho
federal officers, civil and military, as well
as Kellogg himself, knew that it was ut
terly void. It would bo no charity to sup
pose; cither of thom ignorant enough to be
lieve that a judge of the United States
Court had any authority or jurisdiction of
the subject matter, or any l ight whatever
to intermeddle with the business. Never
theless the marshal and the commander of
the federal troops, acting in pursuance of
previous instructions from Washington
iind with the approbation of the President
himself, undertook to execute tho order,
expelled the officers of the existing govern
ment and put tho pretender and bis adher
ents into full possession of the State.
"Political power unlawfully obtained is
always abused. The State was insulted,
oppi essed and plundered until it. became
'a vexation even to hear the report thereof.'
To gorge the rapacity of the rulers, proper
ty and capital were so burdened with
taxes that a general confiscation of every
honest, man's lands, goods and money
would hardly have been a more grievous
intlictiou. This was borne by the people
so patiently that the spirit of their fore
lathers seemed dead within them. Their
tameness was excusable only by two rea
sons. J ii the first place a successful resist
ance was impossible while tho usurper
was surrounded and guarded by tho bayo
nets of tho federal army ; and second, they
looked forward to the election as a peace
luljj remedy for their wrongs. But this
last hope left them when they saw that
Kellogg was arranging the machinery of
the registration to cheat them by a false
count of the votes and thus keep them in
subjection for an indefinite time.
"Convinced t hat they must rise by their
own unassisted strenth or be forever fallen,
they resorted to the ultima ratio, threw off
shackles and placed the supreme executive
power in tho hands of the man who had
been legally elected nearly two years be
fore. Never was revolut ion more just or
conducted with greater prudence. Its suc
cess was complete ; the baseless fabric of
tyranny fell ;it tho first rush of the popu
lar movement; its chief absconded, his
familiars slunk away from Iiis ruined for
tunes, and all over the State.tho official
instruments of corruption yielded their
places to the appointees of tho lawful gov
ernment,. Louisiana was free and every
friend of liberty and justice in or out of
the State rejoiced over the fact. But tho
President was determined to put. the yoke
back again on tho people of the State. To
that end he sought out Kellogg in Iiis bid
ing place; again expelled the. true Govern
or and again forced the submission of the
people to the same adventurer whom he
had aided before.
"The unconstitutional character of the
President 's first act, when he overthrew
tho then existing government and put Kel
logg in the executive chair by mere force,
is admitted both by Mr. Johnson and Mr.
O'ConoV. It would have been wonderful,
indeed, if either of them had attempted to
justify so plain and palpable a violation of
the fundamental law. But they differ ap
parently about the President's duty at tho
time of his second intervention. I concur
with Mr. Johnson in the opinion that af
ter Kellogg was in the President could not
turn him out ; he was dc facto Governor;
and no matter whether be became so by
fraud, or force, or accident,«the fact of pos
session was all that the President could
lawfully see.
"Of eonrse, I dissent from Mr. O'Conor
with all the cautions deference due to bis
great name ; but if he means to say that
General Grant had a right to pull down
the de facto government of Kellogg when
ever he repented his own act in setting it
up, I venture to put in a denial. Keniem
ber, the President has no right to turn any
body out, nor even to inquire how any ac
tual incumbent got in. To overthrow one
de facto government because he had
wrongfully overthrown another, would, in
stead of atoning for the lirst error, only
double the blunder. He cannot play fast
and loose with the liberties of a State, nor,
like Pliaroah, let the people go free or bohl
them iu bondage according as the Lord
hardens his heart or terrifies him with
plagues
"Bot I respectfully submit that this
point on which Mr. Johnson and Mr. O'
Conor divide is not in the case. General
Grant never intervened to protect a defac
to government in Louisiana. His last act,
like the first one, was a war against the
existing authorities. Kellogg never had
any title except his naked possession.—
That was enough while it lasted; but
every vestige of power had left him when
the federal troops took him from his hid
ing place in the custom-house and placed
him a second time in the executive chair.
The ilfcEnery government _ was at that
time as completely established as if its
power had dated a century back. It was
the government de jure. That did not do
it much practical good while its officers
were prevented by the military force of
the Usurper from exercising their fuuetions;
but when tho people took their business
iu to their own hands and put their elected
into their proper places, then the legal
title and the actual possession nnited in
the same persons. It is mere folly to eay
that Kellogg was Governor an instant af
ter that. The forcibl'e reinstatement of
him was an insurrection against the pro
per authority of the State as much as his
first installment.
"If I am right thus far, it follows that
General Grant on both occasions commit
ted a grave violation of his constitutional
duty, in a matter vitally affecting the
rights of tho States and the liberties of
tlm people. Of his conduct there can cer
tainly be no decent pretense of jastiffica
tion, and. so far as I can perceive, no reas
onable excuse, unless ho can say that his
legal advisers imposed upon him by a false
reading of the constitution."
Interesting Experience in tho Game
of Draw Poker.
It was a Mr. Simmons' deal. I
was the oldest man, and the blind
was three, calls seven. Ike Bag
gies saw it ; then it was risen by
Jones to fifteen for to play. Brown
came in, and also the dealer stayed.
Then it took me twelve to make it
good, which I put np, and I remark
ed to the society that it would cost
only twenty-five for to draw. Ev
ery last gentleman stayed, but it
was not risen any higher. Then
the dealer says to me, " How many
will you take F Says I, " a card."
I had aces and kings, and got an
aco in the draw. Ike took three
and Jones two, bnt Brown had
enough, and told the dealer to help
hisself, which he took only five.
There was now about 190 chips on
the board. Ike bet one, Jones went
ten better, and Brown raised it to
twenty, because he stood pat. The
dealer said thatliis'n was valued at
twenty more. Then said J, "How
many does it take me?" Someone
said " forty chips," which I invest
ed likewise with sixty better. Then
all passed up to Brown, and I
wanted him bad to stay with his
steal, but his sand gave out, and
ho passed. Says tho dealer to me,
'• How many did you draw ?" Says
I, " a card." "Well," says he, "I
don't want to law down this hand ;
I will bet sixty more than you !"
Now the dealer was a stranger like
to our party, ne was from the
country and did not know mnch
about D. P. So I thought it was
my charitable duty to let him down
easy, and 1 only called him.
What have you got!" said I.
"Two pairs !" said the Mr. Simmons.
Then it was my time to be sorry
that I »had an ace-full on kings.
"But,'' said the genial Mr. Sim»
motis, " mine is two pairs of jacks !"
Then I said "O !" and put on my
hot and went on the street to look
for Christmas. As I went out the
door, Brown asked me " how many
I took ?" But Brown always was
a person who will kick a man when
he is down.
Ladies Comparing Their Gar
ters .—The other day, after a
meeting of a certain famous wo
men's club in New York, the ladies
amused themselves comparing their
garters, to see which wore the
handsomest ; for garters of extrav
agant expense have lately come in
to fashion, and several of these club
members wear theirs claâpqfl with
gold and precious stones. The
jewelers are all introducing new
designs for garter clasps which
promise shortly to cost as mnch as
the bracelets which fashion has
discarded. A charming woman
and singer in society is said to
wear a pair of garters which cost
five hundred dollars.— [New Yorl
