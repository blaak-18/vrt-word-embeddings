By Dr. Dickson
Shreveport, La,. Jan. 8, 1903.-Dr. S.
A. Dickson, Chairman Fire Department
Committee: Dear Sir-Would respect
fully call your attention to the im-pe
tive need or immediate action being
taken in the matter of an aeriaT truck
being purchased for the fire department.
At the Belcher & Creswell fire on
Tuesday night the necessity of a larger
truck was amply demonstrated when all
ladders were brought into play and in
order to get on the roof of adjoining
buildings it was necessary to place lad
ders against awning, carry lead on too,
then draw ladder up to awning in order
to reach the roof. Had the fire not been
conquered like it was. this might have
been the only means of escape for the
men on the roof, and it might have been
a very serious case had it been neces
sary to remove people from the upper
loor by way of the roof. While in con
versation this morning with you, in the
presence of the mayor, he gave his
views regarding th matter. and I be
lieve he seemed inMessed with the
necessity of an aerial. Mr. W. H. John
son. general inspector of the National
Board of Fire Underwriters, after his
tour of inspection on August a6 last,
recommended the purchase of an aerial
truck, and in my report to the city
council October i last I snga sted the
ourchase of an aerial and samei was re
ferred. to the fire committee, but action
on same was deferred. Would respect
fully suggest that this matter be taken
an b your hosaorable committee and
that same be referred to the council for
action. Very respeetfull
CHRIS O'BRIEN,
Chief of Fire Department.
