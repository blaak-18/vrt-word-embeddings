L'ART NOIA EAU IN THE REALM OF I
GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES.
Examples of the Incoming Mode-A
New Fad In the Lucky Union of
Opal and Turquolar--Bead. of All
Kinds Extremely Popular.
The delightful curves of Iart nouveau
shape the jewelry that is strictly the
latest. Beauty of form and beauty of
color are its attractions. The new art
avoids the monotony of yellow gold and
tinges the precious metal with tender
green. with rose, with amber and with
flamelike hues. It shows straight lines
and employs every rounded and ser
pentine modeling for which nature can
afford a suggestion. Its precious stones
are placed not according to convention,
bhut to please the eye of the true art
BIELL BROOCH AND SPIDER WEB COLLAB.
slt, for that is what we have now-not
mere mechanics, but art workers, in
jewelry.
The illustrations given are of the
new art. The shell shaped brooch of
sea green enamel set with perfect
pearls is not only a dream of loveliness,
but it exemplifies the present fad for
green and white. The spider web col
lar shows an extreme aspect of the
new mode. Fortunately the spider is
kept well in the background, and the
point that attracts the eye is the beau
tiful moth whose body is formed of one
crude pearl flanked by transparent
enamel wings.
The decolletage" ornament affords a
better example than the last of I'art
nouveau as it is commonly seen. With
its curiously cut sapphire center drop
and tasseled side pendants in black and
white pearls, it. touches an evening
bodice with exceptional elegance.
Beads for the neck have rolled their
way silently but surely into our affec
tions. Plain gold, turquoise, opal, coral
and atmber all exercise their fascina
tions and principally in single strand
throatlets. A variation in these neck
laces is a single row of pale pink coral
beads divided each from its fellows
by a pierced diamond. Opals are treat
ed in the same way. The union of pink
coral beads and pearls is uncommon
and pleasing.
But the most chic fad and as yet the
property of a few.of the "top crust" Is
to combine opals and turquoises, the
well known good fortune of the latter
offsetting any lingering shred of ill
luck that may cling to the opalescent
beauty.

A very distinguished potentate, not
disinclined at any time to give his opin
ion upon any subject, is reported to
have made recently the following pro
nrouncement: "Women u )should stick to
three things-church, children and
kitchen." I seem to see America hold

words, and even old England smiling
gently. Germsany no doubt most ar

men and women alike, to progress. The
ideal of the worker is progress. The
thinker is always endeavoring to think
himself forward to a clearer, wider
mind. Men wish to moaw on, and do
move on, with however faltering steps.
Why, in heaven's name, should women
remain hovering eternally over the
stewpans?
I have no patience with the man who
obstinately ignores the capabilities of
woman and goes on de('laring against
all evidence that she is meant to be a
domestic drudge. That women who
bear children should attend properly
to those children is certain enough.
Some duties stare one in the face and
do not admit of argumenlt. It is also
fairly obvious that any woman' who'
a believer in a religion should not neg
lect her religion.
But what magica? la i. what stranger
mysterious commandment, links, all wo
men in man's minid with the rolling
pin and the basting machine? And
why, when a woman has washed her
offspring, put on the clean dresses,
been to church ind cooked the dinner,
should she be debarred from reading
Marcus Aurelius, from practicing Bee
thoven, from writing .a novel or from
working out a mathematical problem?
I have known a canS *ef a woman
who was gifted-by whom? The evil
one. I suppose the church, children
and kitchen gentlemen would answer
with a brain. She married. Her hus
band died, and she was left penniless
with certainly two, and I believe three,
young children. She stuck to those0
children and has been sticking to them
ever since, supporting them and her
self by using her brain. She is a writer.
If, instead of becoming a distinguished
writer, she had meekly bowed to the
I opinion of the potentate and the many
who think with him and had become a
cook, what would have bappined to
those children? What would have been
their education?
I know an extraordinarily gifted wo
man musician whose name as a com
poser is famous all over the English
speaking world. Well,. she cooks
"Scotch eggs" and "devils" turkey as
I no one else can. But she does not do it
every day or even every week, and it
would be a great pity if she did. She

Secrets of social Power.
In the art of conversatkmon lies to some
extent the secret of social power. Seek
by every possible means to remedy any
deficiency and by reading and fre
quenting the libraries where books and
magazines are abundant gain thorough
acquaintance with every timely topic.
In due time will come the pleasure
of entertaining guests in one's own
home, and in this connection there is a
never to be forgotten fact that there
should be an intimate correspondence
between the circumstances of the host
ess and the style in which she enter
talna. By the use here of the word
"style" It is not intended to convey the
idea that one may not stamp her enter
tainments with the ball marks of ele
gance and at the same time with sim
plicity.
The unwriten laws of our social life
declare hospitality a reciprocal thing,
and no young woman who seeks to be
honest with herself and the world
should fail to return in some manner
her social obligations unless indeed by
her talents she has added luster to the
entertainments of others. Even the
bachelor maid may if she have a friend
with her manage many delightful af
fairs.-Table Talk.

Tho Newest Wrtaldes In the Art et' I
Modiste and MIlluter.
A spirit of inquiry is already in the,
air. It is well known that by this time,
fashions for the season to come havea
been already established in the work- t
shops of the great makers of modes. ,
But no one may lay a too previous
hand upon them. One by one they
slowly escape from their jealous cus
todians and manifest themselves to the
eager and expectant world. First, as
i L'ART NOUVEAU RECEPTION GOWNo
it would seem, to work its way out is
the I'art nouveau style. Here is one
specimen of it, with its waved lines,
Jewels aqd rich color effect.
The low blouse, with fult elbow
sleeves and three tier skirt in ca
nary yellow satin, red lined, is set off
with reedlike leaves in green satin out
lined with white silk cord. The belt,
epaulets and a huge butterfly motif in
green velvet are embroidered with gold
traceries and inlaid with red stones
by courtesy, rubies. A similar ruby
clasps the belt, and yellow silk stock
ings and gilt kid shoes give the finish
ing touch of color.
As modified panniers of lace Or em
broidery have appeared on the hips of
French evening gowns. the picturesque
i and gay vogue of Watteau rises among
the probabilities and pleasantly appeals
to youth and a light heart.
Full, rich colors-emerald green, im
perial purple 'and royal blpe-contrast
with nature's tender scheme for early
spfpqrg. Wood brown, too, fills an im
portant place.
The large versus theismali hat will
be one of the exciting questions of the
season. Parisian elegantes who are
foremost in the van of fashion seem in
clined to throw their influence in with
the latter. But it is not amiss for the
average woman to consider well wheth
er she will forsake the friendly and be
coining shade of the wide plateau in
favor of a rival so exacting in its de
mands upon the facial lines as is the
small chapeau. A hat smaller in width
than the face is a trying and insufli
clent frame for many countenances.
But grea, is Fashion, and her will pre
vails.
Touches of black, as choux, sashes,
stole ends or cravats, are likely to be
as modish as ever. their value in throw
ing high lights and gay colors into re
lief being too great to be relinquished.
Puffs, single, double or treble, are ap
pearing on dress skirts. As a single
puff the main portion of the dress skirt
"blouses" over the top of the lower or
trimmed portion.
Neck wraps for the spring entirely
forsake the old round boa form. The
long, fiat stole and the fitted cape with
long ends will reign in its stead. It is
composed of filmy, fluffy fabrics that,
with plait and ruffles, relieve the flat
ness. Ost ch feathers also are made
up thus.
It behooves us to remember that the
box plait and strapping are everywhere
fast replacing the tuck.
The nun's niait in a series similar to
several wide hems appears on some of
the latest evening gowns.

& Pleatmtal S pply of Shoes Means
Beth Comfort and Economy.
Two or three pairs of ordinary shoes
in fair order eo that they may be worn
alternately will be found to give bet
ter service, as well as better condition
of the feet, than a less generous supply.
While this requires the investment of
somewhat more money at the start it
costs less in the end.
If therere are corns, lsoreness or tender
ness of any part of the feet. it will be
found due to the continuoulls pressure
of the shoes. As no two pa irs will af
fect the feet in quite the sa:me way the
effects from one pair will be avoided
by wearing another pnir. giving a dif
ferent pressure, the following dlay. Giv

to wear each but two days in a week,
it will be found that their effects have
been so neutralized that trouble from
aching corns and compressed joints
will be almost a thing of the past. That
this is not merely theory, but a fact.
may be determined by any one who
will make the trial.
Another advantage is that with a gen
erous supply of footwear a single pair
can be withdrawn from service at any
time for repairs which are needed, and
thus the proverbial "stitch in time' -
which is nowhere more true- will keep
all the shoes in good condition and en
able the owner to get from them more
and better service than when they are
worn too long before going Qo the re
pair department.

How to Press Cloth.
When woolen cloth is to be pressed,
but not washed. it is sometimes a ques
tion of hoc' best to give it the damp
ness that will enable the hot iron to
remove folds and wrinkles. Good re
sults are to je had by wringing a sheet
out of "warm water, spreading it on a
large table. arrangIng upon It the
pieces to be pressdtl and then folding
or rolling all into a bundle. After lying
thus for seve'ral hours the cloth is even
ly damp. but not wet. and all creases
and folds softened to the best possibie
condition for the ironing. The pressing
rather than ironing must be done sloe,
ly with irons not too hot or too cool,
moving them just fast enough to pre
vent one from printing its outline on
the goods. Hot enough to raise a steam,
but not hot enough to scorch wool, is
right for the irons. Lady's cloth treat
ed thus loses every crease and the too
clinging softness lent it by wear. Thin
ner goods are handled the same way
with equal success. The process is of
course that followed by all tailors and
called "sponging," except that no press
ing follows the dampening of new
cloth, it being merely spread smooth
and left to dry.
Grilled Nuts.
Boil two cupfuls of granulated sugar
with a half cupful of water until it

and dried almonds and filberts mixed
and stir till ;he sugar grains and clings

New York, Feb. 9. - Now indeed
spring seems to be here. for we have
all the lovely and tiowery cottons and
linens, with their dainty colorings and
their sheer delicacy. laid at our feet.
Challies take the lend easily in the
lightweight wools. They are as ever
exquisitely printed in the loveliest fli

so near to nature as to re',cmble a min

there are hourette stripes. This is in

signs that led me to think this would
be a great season for mohair, and a
was not mistaken, for mohair is one of
the best and most popular of all the
silk and wool goods made. This

of the mohair is plain black, although
some of it is woven into small' and
neat figures.
Embroidered pongee and fine linen
batistes are among the very elegant
outdoor materials for next summer
and the challies for home gowns for
immediate use. Soma of these soft
French challies have black ground and
colored flowers, large or small, to suit
each taste.
Madras, dimity. Scotch zephyrs, per.

of cottons are with us yet. only prettier
than ever and with perfected dyes,
making them more valuable. These are
for shirt waists and for house frocks.
Among more expensive and inciden
tally more fragile cottons we find a
beautiful French mercerized voile in
all the season's colors, very sheer and
fine. This comes double width. There
are linen grenadines. black with white
brocaded stripes, printed pongee mull,
looking so nearly like the silk that it
takes sharp eyes to see the difference,
and a :otton and silk material called
panne silk. It is intended, like the
pongee mull, for evening wear or for
reception dresses. It comes plain, dotted
or with floral, striped and dresden fig
ures. A reception gown is shown made
of this dainty and inexpensive fabric,
for it costs but 30 cents a yard. The
dress is fitted to the figure by folds and
is trimmed with black chantilly lace.
The dress is ivory white.
The new pattern hats are almost
ready for inspection, and I may say
that never did I see such exquisite
taste shown as in the floral ornamenta

even the stems are literally perfect.
