Watson's Address at the ’Farmers’ Union
Contention in Nelv Orleans
The speech of Hon. Thomas E.
Watson, at the New Orleans cotton
convention, called by the Farmers’
Educational and Co-operative Union,
was received with rapt attention and
sincere enthusiasm. A vast crowd
was gathered at the Coliseum rink in
New Orleans on Thursday night, at
tracted by the announcement that Mr.
Watson would be there.
Mr. Watson was the speaker of the
evening, and the last of the confer
ence.
His appearance on the platform
was the signal for an ovation such as
is seldom accoded any other public
man. Owing to illness, his address
was not prolonged beyond forty-five
minutes, but it lost nothing in bril
liancy and force.
On being introduced by Hon. Phil
lip Werlein as a “distinguished
Southerner, who was known more as
a Southern man than as an Ameri
can,” Mr. Watson said:
“If it be true, as Mr. Werlein has
stated, that I have become known
more as a Southern man than as an
American, it must be because of the
fact that the East knows what her
interests are, and is attending to
them; the North and West realize
what their interests are and are giv
ing attention to them, whereas the
iSouth has been neglectful of her
own welfare and has been made the
subject province of other sections,
and it is high time that some one
should be endeavoring to arouse her
attention to it.
Country Suffers With Spinal Trou
ble.
“My friend, President Barrett,
tells me that none of the speakers
who have thus far addressed the con
vention has told you that the farm
ers are the backbone of the country.
Possibly the omission of this well
worn statement is due to the fact that
none of the speakers were eager to
invite questions as to the reason why
we have such a bad case of back
ache. Granting that the farmer is
the backbone of the country, we cer
tainly have a very complicated case
of spinal trouble on our hands.
“It is a well-known fact that I
have devoted much time through
many years to the study of govern
mental questions in their relation to
the farmers, and in many ways and
during a long series of years have
shown myself a friend to the farmers.
It is equally well known that the ag
ricultural classes have a certain fond
ness for me which is ready to put it
self in evidence on any day except
the first Tuesday after the first Mon
day in November in presidential elec
tion years.
Want Only Fair Play.
“The three great branches of in
dustry, of wealth production, upon
which every nation must depend for
its greatness, are agriculture, com
merce and manufactures. If the gov
ernment assumes toward each an at
titude of impartiality, limiting itself
to the governmental function of pro
tecting the three branches for the
full enjoyment of life, liberty and
property, then the result to each is
the same. None is built up at the
expense of any other. In a case like
that the government practically says,
here is a free field and a fair fight, it
is an open race for all, let the worth
iest win. There shall be no adven
titious aid to one branch of industry
at the expense of another. To each
branch the government says: 4 1 will
protect you from wrong; you shall
have the strong arm of the law as
your support; more than this you
need not expect; there shall be no
hot-house process of development;
there shall be no taking from Peter
to pay Paul; there shall be no para
site feeding upon some other growth
—to each branch of industry the gov
ernment says, 1 ( Root, hog, or die. ’ ’
“But, suppose the government, in
stead of impartially allowing each
branch of industry to take care of
itself according to the laws of na
ture, should go into the business of
fostering wealth production, it is ap
parent that to be just the government
should foster all, equally. In that
event, it is apparent that the net re
sults would be precisely the same £Ts
though the government had pursued
a policy of hands-off.
“But suppose the government fos
ters one industry at the expense of
the other two —then it will have en
tered an era of injustice, of legalized
pillage of two industries to support a
third. In the long run, the result
of this must necessarily be the very
great injury, if not prostration, of
the two unfavored industries and
the unnatural enrichment of the fav
ored industry.
“But suppose the government
should adopt as its permanent policy
• the fostering of two of these indus
tries to the exclusion of the third —■
then what sort of situation have we?
It requires no sage to predict that the
third branch of industry, having to
struggle for itself under a burden
fastened upon it by law for the ben
efit of the other two branches of in
dustry, will either be broken entirely
by the load which the government has
placed upon its shoulders, or will so
waste away that the vigor of health
and strength will be lost.
No Aid for Agriculture.
“What are the actual facts so far
as our country is concerned? What
has our government done for agricul
ture, commerce and manufactures?
Has she pursued the wise policy of
letting each go it alone; of letting
each take care of itself; of letting
each fight its own battle; of compell
ing each to develop that strength
which comes from self-reliance, self
dependence, self-confidence ?
“ Would to God that it had been
so!
“Had the government wisely, firm
ly, consistently followed that policy
of strict impartiality toward the
three great hand-maidens of her
glory, this country would not now
present such an appalling spectacle
of enriched classes and impoverished
masses.
tjio doors of the first congress
Jeffersonian
came the manufacturer his hand
outstretched, begging for special fa
vors. He wanted to be protected
from the foreign manufacturer on the
other side of the sea. It was impos
sible to give him any special favor
without taking something from his
unfavored American brethren. But
he got what he wanted, nevertheless,
and from that first congress down to
the last there has never been a time
when the manufacturer was not be
seeching congress for special legisla
tion in his behalf, and he has never
yet reached a limit of rapacity be
yond which he was ashamed to go.
Infamous Tariff Incubus.
“There never was a more infa
mous tariff law than that which was
called the McKinley bill, until the
country was given the Wilson-Gor
man bill, and even that shameful sur
render of the rights of a people to the
greedy beneficiaries of special priv
ilege was exceeded in its atrocity by
the Dingley bill, under which this
republic is now suffering.
“So far has the evil gone that ev
ery American consumer of manufact
ured goods pays about twice as much
as the goods are worth, and of this
amount the government gets only
about one-fifth, while the manufact
urer gets the balance. No wonder
that our statistical abstract in 1905
disclosed the awful fact that our
manufacturers cleared not only 8 per
cent upon the $10,000,000,000 invest
ed, but cleared $2,000,000,000 be
sides. No wonder that the Standard
Oil Company can become so fabu
lously rich and be able to pay $3,000
per year as subscription price to The
Manufacturers’ Record and The
Southern Home Magazine; no wonder
that the Standard Oil Company can
pay tens of thousands of dollars for
a senator, and other thousands to
governors who appoint judges; no
wonder that the sugar trust can af
ford to put $500,000 into a political
campaign fund, and no wonder that
throughout all the land is the cry of
distress coming from the unemployed
of the cities and those of the country
who produce what they cannot sell
at a living price!
“What has the government done
for commerce?
“It has killed our ocean-going
trade by denying the protection of
the American flag to any ship not
built in America, at the same time
that it compels the American ship
builder to submit to the extortionate
demands of the protected dealers in
shipbuilding materials —thus making
it impossible to build ships in Amer
ica at a cost which renders competi
tion with European shipbuilders pos
sible. We are not allowed to buy a
vessel built in free trade England;
not allowed to buy from Scotland, or
France, or Germany, but compelled
to buy materials whose price has
been artificially raised by a tariff du
ty levied for the benefit of the steel
trust. Nowhere on earth is it so
costly to build a ship as in America,
consequently nowhere on earth is it
go bard to own a ship which can com-
pete with the more cheaply built
ships of Europe.
“As to our inland commerce, rep
resented by the railways, the story is
altogether different. Inland com
merce has had everything that it asks
for, and it has asked for everything.
The government built a magnificent
transcontinental line —not a dollar of
private capital went into the Pacific
system —yet, through jugglery of
financiers and the treacherous eon
duct of those who represented the
people in the government, private
corporations have gobbled up those
roads, as all of us know, and they
are now loaded down with hundreds
of millions of dollars in stock and
bonds on which the people are pay
ing annual tribute. The right to con
demn private property for corporate
use; the right to so fix freight and
passenger rates as to earn dividends
upon billions of dollars of. fictitious
capital; the right to systematize the
ownership of what are nothing more
than modern public roads so that ev
ery traveler passing up and down
shall be compelled to pay turnpike
rates, while every wagon load of prod
uce on its way to market must pay
toll along the line —this is what the
government has done for inland com
merce. It has handed over to a half
a dozen railroad kings the irresisti
ble and irresponsible power of taxa
tion over 85,000,000 people who have
neither voice, vote nor influence in
the deliberations of those who assess
the tax.
“Thus we have the astounding
spectacle of a government devoting
itself entirely to the noble duty of
enriching two classes of its citizens
at the expense of a third —-burdening
one branch of industry with the un
bridled, inordinate greed of the oth
er turn. The manufacturer gets all
he w T ants, inland commerce gets all
it wants and they both get it at the
expense of agriculture.
“What has the government done
for agriculture? Nothing. The farm
er has never asked for anything but
justice—a free field and a fair fight—
and he has never been able to get
this. Nobody has ever heard him ask
the government to burden manufact
ures or commerce for his benefit. Not
once in all the history of the country
has he made any effort to secure spe
cial privilege for himself. Always,
everywhere, he has been the earnest,
unselfish, patriotic worker.
Farmers Won Nation’s Independence.
“When there were vast wastes of
wilderness to be cleared with the
slow, arduous work of the ax, he
cleared them. When there were pes
tilential marshes to be drained, he
has drained them. When there were
deserts to be reclaimed, he has wat
ered them until they were made to
blossom as the rose. When there
were savages to be driven back, it
was the crack of his rifle that her
alded the advance of the banners of
civilization. When national inde
pendence was to be won for the
struggling colonies, it was the armies
