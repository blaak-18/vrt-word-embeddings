U'CH a nice lot of letters
and articles have come in
to the “clearing house”
and the Weekly Jeffer
sonian is delighted to
know that its women
readers are pleased. Geor
gia has thus far been the
first to respond, but as
CUT paper goes to Canada, Mexico,
Europe, Australia, the Philip
pfaies and Orient generally, as well
M all over the Union, it is not too
much to hope that ere long we will
be a congenial, cosmopolitan gather
ing on this page. All contributions,
by the way, intended for this depart
ment, should be addressed to 709
Temple Court, Atlanta, to save delay.
In these days of “financial folly”
when the idle, silly type of rich wom
an is wont to discant upon the strin
gent economy she must practice in or
der to “live” on a million or so a
year and who cannot “dress” upon
less than many hundreds or thousands
of dollars, it is refreshing to read
the wholesome sartorial conclusions
arrived at by Mrs. E. G. McAllister,
a wealthy widow and a very success
ful business woman of Miami, Flor
ida, who says:
“The sum of $250 a year should
be plenty to clothe any girl, no mat
ter how rich she is, and those who
spend more are wilfully wasting mon
ey.
“Os course where I come from it
wouldn’t take that much, for in Flor
ida one can dress all the year round
in simple dimities. There isn’t a
woman in the world who likes bet
ter than I do to see a girl well
dressed, but by that I do not mean
elaborately gowned. Simplicity
should be the keynote of every wom
an’s dress, for frills merely detract
from a pretty face and makes an
ugly face look homelier..
“One every day suit and hat, a
■Sunday suit and hat, a simple even
ing gown for winter, three little
dresses for summer, four shirt waists
and a dark linen skirt and three pair
of pretty shoes are ample for any
girl, no matter in what station of
life, for with those clothes she would
always be neat and clean, and, above
all, simply attired. The entire outfit
should not cost over $250 —and I con
sider that a mighty large sum to
spend on clothes.”
Two hundred and fifty dollars is a
mighty big sum to the average fam
ily and where the means are very
limited, or if there are several daugh
ters, the allowance must be very
much smaller. But there’s no ob
jection to it as the maximum sum, and
to be governed thereby would assur
edly promote simpler and altogether
better standards of dress among all
classes of women.
“You said you thought there was
■no malaria around here”’ said the
indignant stranger.
“I did think «o,” answered Farmer
Corotossel.

A BOUQUET OF BEAUTIFUL
THOUGHTS.
It was with a th nil of real pleasure
that I first beheld a department for
women in the Jeffersonian. I have
wanted it a long time. In fact, I
once yaxed very brave, and wrote
to Mr. Watson, asking him to give
us a page. You see I believe in the
Jeffersonian and its principles with
all the strength that in me is, and I
was very anxious for the women to
have accorne a “clearing house”
—in it.
To my mind, one of the best things
a woman can do —especially a woman
living a rather isolated, country life
—is to grasp every opportunity for
self-improvement that comes her way,
to cultivate some outside interest, to
endeavor to keep herself somewhat up
to date, and in touch* with the world.
My Angel's Song.
By W. D. Wattles.
Sometimes in moments rare, I rise in soul
And leave the Struggling world so far below
That rolling clouds wide-spread beneath my feet
Hide me from sight or sound of strife and woe;
And near at hand, I see with leaping heart,
The gleam of snowy walls and waving wings,
And catch the echo of a distant song,
And weep, because it is Her voice that sings.
And then I sink to gloomy caverns deep
Where not a ray comes from the hidden skies;
Where darkness shudders with the sound of blows,
With clash of arms, apd groans, and wailing cries;
And fearful, through the dark I hurry on,
My trembling soul still to one dear hope clings,
From these vile depths to rise to light again
And win those heights on which my Angel sings.
And then, again, I walk through pleasant groves
Where lovely maidens rest upon the grass;
Where soft, low laughter greets my tempted ear
And thrilling whispers call me as I pass;
All these I shun, and keep my eager way,
Nor love nor sin can tempt or hold me long,
So I may hope for just one instant more
To listen, weeping, to my Angel’s song.
Otherwise, she is so apt to become
narrow in her views and sympathies,
uninteresting, and incapable of giv
ing the growing, expanding minds of
her children, if she be a mother, the
best direction and training.
I would not «ay one word in favor
of sorry, negligent housekeeping, but
women very often get so fastened in
the routine and monotony -of their
daily work until they think they can't
get out. They do the very same
things the very same way, day after
day, and the habit grows on them
until after awhile they feel like that,
if they were to neglect the slightest
detail, the whole household establish
ment would be wrecked. When you
get to that state you better relax,
“let things go,” take a day off, and
try to get out of the rut.
I heard a man say that he bought
a Panama hat just because he didn’t
like them—he almost despised them.
He had worn litt! soft felt hats un-
3effersonUrt
til he felt like he couldn’t wear any
other kind. So he bought the Pana
ma because he didn’t want to —be-
cause he wanted to overcome the
tendency to get cranky and “set”
in his ways.
I am not one of the “suffrag
ettes” —I know perfectly well that
women have the right to vote, if they
want to, but I don’t want to —but
I would like to see every true
woman in the land interested in
politics. There is no other ques
tion that touches our material well
being so vitally as politics. A wom
an ought to know something about
the government under which she
lives, and the laws that affect the
every-day life of herself and her
family. She ought, too, to make her
quiet, refined influence count on the
side of political honesty and right
eousness, but how can she do it if
she knows nothing about political
questions and principles of govern
ment ? <
SALLIE TRUEHEART PARRISH.
Note: But to study political ques
tions and never vote upon them seems
almost like theoretical architecture
without ever erecting a single struc
ture, doesn’t it?
FROM A GEORGIA ROSE.
Cuthbert, Ga.
Editor Jeffersonian:
Jeffersonian just received and was
delighted that you have offered the
women space to write and hope I
will be the first to reply as I am a
great admirer of Mr. Tom Watson’s
works. I believe him to be the smart
est man in the United States (al
though I have never seen him). I
wish him to win the battle, he seems
to be gaining friends, but what do you
call a man who says he believes in
Mr. Watson and thinks “he is the
smartest of men, but I am a demo
crat, and must vote a democratic tick
et, as I have never voted any other”?
We “need” Mr. Watson for a term
and I believe if we get him we will
keep him until he gives up of his
own will. The poor man’ and z the
farmer need help; poor farmers can’t
sell stained cotton and can’t gather
it before the rain; what can we do?
Women, join in and get your fam
ily to vote a Watson ticket; we can
help if we will. I am trying. I want
to get Bethany soon.
Mr. Editor, just get a large waste
basket, for we will write “all at
once. ’ ’
.Yours truly,
GEORGIA ROSE.
Note: Yes, yours is the “very
first ’ ’ reply and a harbinger, I hope,
of letters from a host of other bright
women who will “join in.” Don’t
dread the waste basket. There isn’t
such an article, or even a substitute
for one, in the office. Being of eco
nomical turn of mind, we found the"
waste basket one thing we could get
along very nicely without.
“I CAN’T LIVE WITHOUT YOU.”
By Nixola Greely-Smith.
Lite with the other human creature
we love divides itself into the hours
when we think we can’t live without
him, and others when it seems equally
impossible to live with him—or her,
as the case may be. No. V. in our
series of the pet lies of husbands is
by no means a popular one. In fact,
a great many more men should tell
it than do. It is such a harmless
little fiction and gives so much pleas
ure. Os course, we all know that
civilized man has attained a degree
of philosophy that enables him to
exist in comfort away from every
thing except a laundry.
There are many occasions when
she will hear in his most vehement
accents. “Oh, you’re impossible!
No self-respecting man could live
with you!” That it is only fair his
amiable mood should restore domestic
confidence by prompting the softer
utterance: “What would Ido with
out you? Why, I couldn’t live!”
He need never fear that she will
believe him to his hurt, that is, to
the point of taking advantage of his
supposed dependence. The least
cynical of women has a wholesome
belief in the instability of masculine
affection that will prevent it.
Gradually, by force of much telling,
he, too, will come to believe it, and
the moment two persons realize that
they cannot live without each other
after they have tried living together,
of course, for experience alone gives
value to such a statement—they will
be apt to endeavor to make the com
pelling association as peaceful as
possible,—New York World.
