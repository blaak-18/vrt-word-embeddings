ty The Democrat nominates Mr.
Evuriste Arcliinard for the Legisla
ture from this Parish. Mr. Arclii
nard is a high toned, educated and
refined gentleman, so pure and up
right that uo breath of criticism
has ever attached to his name, lie
has never had any connection with
politics, and we heartily endorse
the suggestion. The Parish Con
vention could find no better or
more acceptable name iu the Parish
than that of Mr. Evariste Arclii
nard.
Since writing the above Mr. Ar
chinard has sent ns a letter which
we publish, declining to allow bis
name fo go before tho Convention.
BÂTON ROUSE CONVENTION.
On next Monday the Convention
at Baton Rouge will convene, for
the purpose ol nominating a State
Treasurer, and inaugurating tho
Campaign. This Convention is
called by tho Democrat ic and Libe
ral Central Committees, and the
< Committee of Seventy. It will have
représentai Ives from all political
parties or elements opposed to Rad
icalism iu Louisiana. The repre
sentatives from North and West
Louisiana, will very probably ad
vocate the adoption of the White
Man's or Conservative party. The
New Orleans delegates will be cer
tain to demautt the name and or
gaiiizatiori of tho Democratic par
ty, but we believe and confidently
hope, that a sijjf sncrillciug spirit of
patriotism will actuate the Conven
tion, and it will route up to the
exactions of the times, and lay
aside for this Campaign, all party
prejudices and predilections.
The country can lie harmonious
ly united by the recognition of pop
ular sentiment, which has its origin
in the necessity of taking up the
gauntlet that has been so defiantly
thrown down, and accepting issues
which are unavoidable; the contest
is one of race, and as such must be
met. There is no «lodging the
«question, and if an attempt is made
to confine the people iu their grand
uprising to <il«l party naliu's and
prejudices, uu<l tore«) them t«i make
a polit i<-iil contest where no politi
eal principle or theory is involved,
a great mistake will be* made, anil
untold injury indicted. But there
will be difficulties at the beginning,
in the organization of the Couven
lion, as from some of the Parishes,
two sets of delegates will probably
present themselves, claiming to
represent tho people ol their par
ishes. As we understand, the Con
vention is not a purely partisan
one, and if such a spirit should ae
turtle the Convention, some «lilll
cully and trouble may be produced.
In every case however we pre
sume the Convention will wisely
admit delegate« who properly rep
resent tho great body «>( I lie people
opposed to Radicalism, and not
those who iu a minority claim to
represent a party without support
ers, who claim a banner without
stamlard bearers, or a corporal's
guard to rally around it. The issue
presented to tho while people of
Louisiana, is «if too serious import
the necessity of carrying the next
election, is too great, t«i jeopardi/.«
it by compromising with, ami an
attempted conciliation of, a small
minority, at the expense of the «m
thusiasm of the great mass of th«
people. The Convention will be
sovereign in its capacity, ami by
standing firmly by the delegates of
the people, it; will <lo much to «lis
countenance unwarranted opposi
tion to the ranks of our party, and
settle the question at once, whether
minorities small in numbers, in
times so momentous as these, will
be permitted to dictate to and con
trol great majorities.
Let tho Convention rebuke this
spirit of party issuound sooner or la
ter all opposition "will vanish away
into thin air." We have every rea
son to hope, that the Convention
will be largely attended, and the
majority of the delegates will
go in tho interests of the State,
and the whole people, and not in
the bigoted spirit ol party, that
would sacrilico tho. State, that a
party's name might bo preserved.
As for Rapides, it has enthusiasti
cally adopted tho White Man's
Party for this campaign, and our
delegates go as its representatives,
and will bo received as such.
With the list headed by such names
is Ex-Governor T. O. Moore, an
aged and venerable Democrat, and
a long list of others, well known to
the State, there is no doubt of their
recognition, as the proper repre
sentatives of the combined opposi
tion to Radicalism in the old Par
ish of Rapides. In the mean time,
we will patiently await its action,
and be prepared to give toit ou r
hearty support, believing as wo do
that it will firmly unite the white
people of Louisiana, on a broad
plutform of principles, that will se
cure undoubted victory, at the
polls in November next
THE DEMOCRAT'S FRICASSEE.
Tho Ahtxandria Democrat , under
tho head of " Dashes here and
there" iu his last week's issue, in
«lulged in nn attempted ridicule of
a speech that was made by some
young man at the Mass Meeting on
Ilm Hlh inst. Now wo suppose that
the Editor of a would be first class
.Tournai of such long standing,
which proposes to mould public
sentiment, and load the uutcrrided,
would have something to sny, ty
way of argument in reply to a
speech of any gentleman, old or
young, that did not suit his views,
through the columns of his widely
circulated Journal. The Editor wo
understand, threatened to <lo this a
few moments after the Speech was
made, when ho broke fiymi the
room, letf the meeting <m the adop
tion of the White Mvffi's Party,
ami sai«l he ha«l washed his hands
of it. But instead of a reply, we
have Iroiu him, what he properly
«tails " Chicken's feet ami Sparrow
Grass." If chickens feet an«l »pnr
row grass delights the Dasher, let
him dash on,'tor we envy him not
his intellectual tant<n y and leave
the Dasher a complete monopoly iu
that style of Ktlitorial Literature,
which we <lo not propose to imitate.
Perhaps it is unpardonable for
youtiff men , even t hough they have
;iasse«l the meridian of life, to form
or express any opinion, upon any
political (pii'stiou, without first con
suiting the aged oraclc of the Dem
ocrât, upon its orthodoxy. But
these are strange ami rather «legen
«•rate times no doubt the Dasher
thinks, when young men who have
passed through thirteen years of
revolution, beliohl their country in
" black ruin and dark despair,"
propose to say <ir do aught for re
lief, that is not iu acconlanee with
Hit? political ritual of the Dasher
twenty years ago. But for inhu
mation we would likit to know how
old men must b«( iu this Demo
cratic country b'jfcro they are al
lowed to think for themselves, and
express opinions upon any political
«|U«-stion, affecting the interest of
the whole people, without regard to
sect. The Dasher ill his venerable
age, may h<< able t«> tell us when lit;
was first permitted to have an opin
ion of his own, if indeed he ever
hail one, on any weightier subject
than " Chicken's feet and Sparrow
1 i rass."
that ho "cauie neur volunteering
This facetious Dasher tells us
his valuable services for "this oc
casion only," to reply to that
" Speech," but took the advice of
a. friend and " let the young one
gush on." How witty ! We'll not
iinlulge iu any hyper criticism u]h»ii
the elegant style ami diction of the
" grave and reverent siognor," but
seriously, we presume the Dasher
came as near volunteering his very
valuable services «>n this occasion,
as ho «lid on another very interest
ing and important occasion, in our
country's history, when volunteers
were needed, but tho Dasher's friend
said " lie still, don't budge an inch,"
let the " young oiu-s " have " all the
funeral to themselves—and so if
was.
Again the Dasher, the " patient "
of an "orator" something original,
but the Dasher's age, gives nim li
cense in all things, wo presume,
was the Secretary of the Mass
M«}eting, and from liini the "young
ones" would like to know if it was
not customary " before the revolu
tion " for Eilitors to publish iu fui i
the proceedings of meetings.—
At that meeting for whieh the
Dasher joined iu the call, tho peo
ple of tlie Parish of Rapides who
had suffered so long by font outra
ges and wrongs, declared unani
mously and enthusiastically, that
they would make the great strug
gle for constitutional ami honest
government, under tho name of the
WHITE MAN'S PARTY, and a
resolution to that eflect was adopt
e«l. Will the Dasher obey the
voice of the people? If so, will he
publish that resolution, and place
the banner of the White Man's
Party at the mast bead ot his pa
per—inscribe upon its folds " invin
cible," aud wo will sail together
over the ruggeil sea, keeping
abreast, ever on ward to storm the
enemies forts, which wo will do vic
toriously, unless aged Dasher, you
«leserttho "youngones," and turn
aside from the glorious path in hunt
of "Chicken's feet and Sparrow
Grass." Adieu ! Dasher Adieu.'
Tho Chronio Grumbler.
Wo dub the Editor of the Demo
crut in view of his evident affliction
with the nialudy, The Chronic
Grumbler. Ho sits like tho bear
with a soro head and just let any
bo«ly or respectable body of people
do anything without first consult
ing him, and he growls and frets at
a fearful rate. He is certainly af
flicted with a bad case of chronic
opposition to the (Jane« h inn and to
everything with which rtny of its
Editors have anything to do. The
"many honors" of one of us has well
nigh ilistracted him. The "green
eye«! monster" has him lu tow ami
ho is always cocked and primed to
go off every time one of our names
appears any where.
Just because one of us happened
to have been selected by the Stock
holders of the Cemetery Associa
tion, h«;c.auso he had been "driving
at it" for five years "and had been
mainly instrumental in awakening
an interest in the subject, as the
President of the Association j the
very first regulation of theirs after
having built a fence around tin/
grave yard, cut out the underbrush,
hired a sexton etc, affords him a
sutlicieut pretext for crying "mon
opoly on the dead" etc. The object j
of giving a monopoly to the sexton i
of digging the graves is to pay him
the only salary except $120 which
Im gets. The price is below that
usually paid, and as the Democrat
tlauiitingly annonces that he has a
yard outside of the Cemetery it in
none of Inn bunt nenn. Lot tlioso who
are interested grumble if they de
sir«* so to <lo.
You ar«( right, Dasher, you need
not trouble yourself about your
grave, "Party" has nothing to «hi
with it, but it is all right. Never
mind about tho three Dollars, we
will let you in on tho privileges ol
th«; press. Don't trouble yourself
you any way for there is another
Boss up there and you couldn't
have things your way, and that
would not suit you at /ill.

TSE DEMOCRATIC MEETING.
As the meeting on Saturday last
was in opposition to the Muss Meet
ing of tho Nth inst, whieh adopted
tho namo of the White Man's Party
and as on Saturday last assured
our reader« of the great enthusiasm
aud unanimnity with which that
name was adopted, wo owo it to
them to inform them of the strength
of this meeting in opposition to the
White Man's Party. Neither of the
Editors of this paper were in town
on that day and wo'have to rely on
the reports made to us. Front all
the information we can obtain and
from the published report of the
Louisiana Democrat whose Editor
was present as "listener and re
porter," we learn that there were
between twelve and fifteen men
who participated iu the meeting
ither as speakers or Voters, and
that there were about twenty or
more "lo«>kers on," many of whom
were boys.
Giving them tho benefit ot every
person iu the room, according to
this, there were but thirty odd
present altogether. The- meeting
was fully udvertised in our columns
and wo may fairly presume that
this is about the strength ot the op>
position to the White Man's Party
hero. Wo do not know how many
t hev may represent outside, lint we
do know that some of the delegates
appointed in opposition to our del
egates, have declined t<?nct and ex
pressed themselves as iu accord
with the White Man's Party. We
publish this morning the letters of
Mr. Robt. C. Hynson, Asa Bell, J.
W. Siins, Dr. G. W. Laney, Messrs
Dennis and Patrick Kelly, Evar
iste Archinnrd and N. L. McGinnis.
Tins " Damheu ."—Well Mr. Dash
er, you have lost your temper with a
vengeance ! "Turkey Cock," "Ephe
moral honors" "oats" etc., and all
without our having done anything
,
....to deserve it, but hit Vou on your
, ,,
sore shin about puritanism. You
did make fun of the grave yard and
the dead who aro buried there and
you «lo so in this issue again. It
was ^legitimate" to hit back at you
for turning our Rail Road dis«;us
siou into an opportunity to preacli
a good Mellmdist and Puritan ser
mou a!>out going to the "Circus"
•'Menagarie," and spending money
with which they ought to build the
I tail Road. "Nonsense" too is rath
or cheeky. Dasher, can't you se»?
that being an interested party you
ought not set yourself up for Judge
an.I Jury t«m ? All this diatribe of
yours smacks rather strongly of en
vy and disappointment that the on
ly honors, "ephemeral" or otherwise
that were heaped On you, was Sec
retary. We understand it all you
know, our crime consists in being
youny ami in not heeding the cra«;k
of that party whip which used to
strike such terror. Hack away "old
'un," ItacJcH aro luid on the shelf, and
we can survive all such licks from
such a sounje ami if we can't, the
resort is left to us to steal away out
of public favor as others have done
before us. A u revoir.
