OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
Just a month from Santa Claus,
and some little boys and girls are
already lying awake at night, won
dering what the good saint will
bring them. We will send a post
card to each member who writes to
us between now and December 16th,
and for the best letters we will give
Christmas presents. Write any
thing you like, just so that it’s your
own. Mail your letters so that they
will get to us not later than Decem
er 16th, and we will publish the
best in our paper of the 23d.
AN ALABAMA FAMILY.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I am a boy 12
years old, and live on a farm, with
my papa and mamma. There are
nine of us five girls and
four boys. We raise a little of al
most everything that can be grown
in this climate, —corn, cotton, pota
toes of both kinds, for our own use
and some to sell, and lots of turnips,
groundpeas and other eatables.
Papa made 300 bushels of corn and
a lot of peas this year. Our cotton
crop is short this time. lam going
to school now. We have a good
school, about half a mile from our
ome, and I go to Sunday-school
every Sunday, and enjoy it very
much. My papa takes The Jeffer
sonian and the Magazine, and he is
a full-blooded Jeffersonian himself.
He says Tom Watson is the greatest
statesman the South has ever had.
I hope Mr. Watson will be our Pres
ident some day. As this is my first
attempt to write, I will close, wish
ng The Jeffersonian much success.
—Frank Casey, Walnut Grove, Ala.
MISSISSIPPI RIDDLES.
I am a little girl, living on the
convict farm, and I am 13 years old,
and in the seventh and eighth
grades. Have red hair, light com
plexion, and am 4 feet 6 inches tall.
This is my first letter to The Jeffer
sonian. My father subscribed for
that paper not long ago. Let me
ask you some riddles: A head, but
no hair? An eye, but no face? To
every one who answers these riddles
I will send a pretty postal.—Your
friend, Annie May McNeill, Parch
man, Miss., Camp No. 6.
(This young lady wrote that she
was 6 feet 4 inches tall, but we are
inclined to think that she had her
figures twisted.)
WON’T YOU WRITE TO HER?
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here comes
the little freckle-faced Missouri girl
again. The weather is much colder
now than when I wrote my other
•etter, and the freckles are not so
many on my nose and cheeks as they
were. I am going to school. Have
been - going ever since the first of
August. I have to stand in the cor
ner sometimes for talking. I get
lots of head-marks in my spelling
class, and always know my other
lessons very well. Daddy Jim, come
up and eat Thanksgiving turkey and
pumpkin pie with me. I will sure
give you a good dinner, if you will
come. I live in the country, but you
would enjoy the ride out from Cen
tralia, and while you are here you
3eff«rsonian
could go hunting with my big broth
er, and perhaps kill some quails and
wild ducks. I know you could kill
lots of rabbits. Do you like to
hunt? My big brother does. I wish
some little girl in Georgia would
write to me, and tell me how they
live down there. I guess they don’t
have so much ice and snow as we
do up here, but they have lots of
niggers. I never see one, except
when I go to town. I never spoke
to one in my life. I think they are
awfully ugly. I enjoy skating on
the big pond in the winter. I hope
old Santa will bring me a pair of
skates at Christmas. I am 10 years
old. —Imogene Boyle, Centralia, Mo.
(I’d like to have some of that tur
key and punkin pie; I “shore”
would; and I’d like to meet you and
that big brother of yours, but this
is our busiest time of the year down
South, and if we don’t pile up the
dollar bills now, old Santy won’t fill
our socks when he comes round. I
hope some little Georgia girl will
write to you, and tell you all about
us.—D. J.)
A LITTLE CORK GIRL.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l am a little
Cork girl, 10 years old. Papa takes
The Jeffersonian, and I like to read
it very much. I have three sisters
and two brothers, six of us in all. I
go to school every day I can. My
teacher’s name is Miss Hattie
Compton. I like her well. lam in
the sixth grade. I will tell some of
my studies, —spelling, arithmetic,
geography, history, fifth reader,
grammar and physiology. My desk
mate is Elizabeth Towles. I have
two pets, a little kitten named
“Snow White”, and a little pony
named “Prince”. I also have a lit
tle buggy. We certainly do have a
good time riding horseback. Hoping
to see this in print, I remain, with
best wishes to The Jeffersonian.—Lu
cile Burk, Cork, Ga.
ALL THE WAY FROM IOWA.
I thought I would write you a
few lines. My uncle takes The Jef
fersonian, and I like to read it. I
am 9 years old. I have one brother,
and six sisters. My birthday is Sep
tember 7th. I help papa with the
cows every night and morning. I
get in the wood and coal. This is
all for this time.—Rebecca Stratton,
Curlew, lowa.
LOOKING FOR SANTA CLAUS.
Here I come again to take up a
little more of your time. My sis
ter’s letter entered the dead letter
office, but I hope mine won’t. Who
likes to go to school? I do. I am
going now, and am in the fifth grade.
Who has my birthday, the 31st of
July? Florence Smith, I like your
letter; come again. It will soon be
Christmas, and we will be looking
for Santa Claus again. I don’t
know what I would do if Santa Claus
did not remember me. I have writ
ten once before, but never described
myself, so I will do it now. I have
blue eyes, light hair and fair com
plexion, except I have a freckled
face.—Nellie Mae Leverett, Flovilla,
Ga.
LETTERS HELD OVER.
We have a great many letters for
the Post-Card Club this week, and
some of them will have to wait until
next week. “The Old Prison Chair”,
sent in by Annie L. Cheves, of Pel
ham, Ga., will be published next
week.

Dropsy—
Given up by Doctor
“I had dropsy, and was told
by my family physician that
there was no chance for me. My
family also gave me up. My
limbs and body were swollen
one-third larger than natural,
water collected around my heart
and I had to be propped up in
bed to keep from smothering. I
took Dr. Miles’ Heart Remedy
until I was entirely cured. This
was in 1902, and I am now able
to do any kind of work on my
farm. My cure was certainly
marvelous.”
L. TURLEY CURD,
Wilmore, Ky.
Dr. Miles’ Heart Remedy has
been wonderfully successful in
relieving heart trouble. Its tonic
effect upon the heart nerves and
muscles is a great factor in
assisting nature to overcome
heart weakness.
Dr. Mlles’ Heart Remedy Is sold by
all druggists. If the first bottle does
not benefit, your druggist will return
your money.
