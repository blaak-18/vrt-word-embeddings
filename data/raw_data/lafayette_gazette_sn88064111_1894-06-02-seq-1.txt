PLOWED UNDER.
I saw a field of rich, green clover grow
Its blossoms honey-laden for the bee;
And turning to tho owner who stood by.
I asked what time the harvesting would be.
"'Twill not be gathered in." "How then?" I
cried,
'" nave you no recompense for all your toil?"
The farmer smiled; he was more wise than I:
" I plow it under to enrich the soil"
And all at once I seemed to see more clear
Some things that I hra tried to eomptchend:.
Has not thie heart, like that broad field, its
growths
That never seem to reach their destined ecd?
Its early dreams that perish unfulfilled?
Its youthful hopes, that vanish ere their
prime?
Its fond afcecttons and its tender love,
Borne down before their perfect blossom
time?
I mused on these, and as I turned my feet
Uinlck to the city with its swift turmoil
I smiled and said in tranquil, sweet content:
"' God plows them under to enrich the soil."
-Kate T. Goode, in N. Y. Observer.
A REPORTER'S "STORY."
How George Stanton Made a Dis
covery in Newspaper Work.
"Write for the Times! Do you imag
ine you went to college for that? You
can't write."
"ilave you ever given me the chance?"
"No. IBut I know you couldn't. I
dareray you've been counting on doing
this, ch?" The younger man bowed.
"And have beeu laying in a stock of
flowing rhetoric and fine-spun the
ories," the elder continued. "llumpb!
The Times wouldn't pay in a month's
time if we fed the public on stuff of
that sort. 1What it wants is food of an
other kind."
"\VWhat's to prevent my providing it
as well as the other writers on the
staff? In my college education to be a
drawback to me? If it is-"
The sentence was left unfinished,
and the elder man silently returned to
his work of glancing over some copy
spread out on the desk before him.
When he had finished the last page, he
turned to the first and wrote "'m. g."
across the top.
"\What does .that mean?" George
Stanton inquired.
"Those letters stand for 'must go.' "
"Then whatever bears them goes?"
Ills uncle surveyed him with a grim
smile lighting his face.
"It's apt to," he said, dryly.
"Then anything I might write would
be printed, regardless of its merit, if
you so marked it?"
"Certainly. But you must remem
ber that an uncle indulgent to faults,
and the proprietor of this paper-a suc
cessful business enterprise-are two
distinct personalities-"
"\Vhich you bear, I understand. But
surely literary merit cuts some figure?"
"U'n-if the name of the writer who
possesses it is well known, it does."
"NAot otherwise?'"
The elder man shook his head em
phatically. "I've no use for 'em."
"Why, that makes out the newspaper
of to-day a money-making machine of
the lowest order," George Stanton ex
claimed, indignantly. "The brains of
the concern are subservient to the
business office."
"Exactly."
There was a pause, during which the
younger man tipped back his chair
against the wall and gazed abstracted
ly at the ceiling. At length he brought
the legs of the chair to the floor with
emphasis.
"I still maintain that it isn't fair
that I shouldn't be given a trial," he
remarked.
"I suppose you've got a batch of
manuscripts all ready to fire at me."
The nephew's face flushed. "I thought
so. Well, I don't want 'em. Now see
here, what this paper wants isn't
rhetoric, it isn't eloquence, it isn't
philosophy, it isn't literary merit, as
you call it-it's just life-plain, every
day life. I wouldn't publish the most
beautiful flight of fancy that was ever
written-I've no use for that sort. But
life-things near, local, personal-give
me those. If you keep your eyes and
ears open, you'll find more tragedy in
one block of San Francisco than in the
whole of Shakespeare."
"Then you give me the chance?"
Frederick Stanton hesitated. "It's
open to you the same as it is to all,"
he replied, indifferently; "you would
be paid for space-work at our regular
rates, providing we accepted it. Mind
you, I don't say I'll take what you
write."
"Buint if it suits, you'll 'm. g.' it?"
"If it suits." the other repeated, a
little sarcastically, with a movement
which closed the interview.
A week later the young man again
presented himself in his uncle's private
office.
"I've followed your advice, Uncle
Fred, and taken life for my subject"
iHe threw himself into a chair and gave
a twist to his head in the direction of
the inner door. It was slightly ajar,
and he rose and shut it before he re
sumed. "You see, what you said about
the tragedies of life-and, of course, I
inferred that you meant the comedies
as well-being right under our noses,
as it were, set me to thinking. Mean
time, I have found out the true mean
ing of your mystic letters. Whatever
bears them must go in the columns of
the next issue, regardless of time,
space or other consideration. Theyare
so potent as to require no explanation,
no suggestions from the molders of pub
lic opinion who preside in the editorial
den. Whatever an editor may receive
from a proprietor initialed 'm. g.' will
be printed, even if it be the death-war
rant of the entire staff."
"Is this a lecture on the depravity of
the press in general, or my own paper
in particular?"
'Neither. It is to let you know that
I have been further enlightened since
we last discussed this subject. I now
understand what ezipts as a mighty
factor in the management of a news
paper, and I want you to put it on the
top of that." He tossed somen sheets of
closely written paper on the desk in
front of the other.
"Hnumphl"
" 'If I listen I may gather the very
matertal he wants' I said. I llstened.
aroIk I Wtr L iryw .bn t I've got
something spicy and realistic enough
to suit even youl"
"I told you that .if you wrote any
thing fit to set up type for, it would be
judged impartially and paid for at the
regl ar rates."
"it isn't the pay so much," George
Stanton replied, contemptuously.
"Want to see yourself in print. I sup
pose. Well, let's see what you've pro
duced." lie took up the sheets before
him and began to read them. When be
lhad finished he turned to his nephew
in surprise. His eye beamed with the
delight begotten of "scoops."
"Well, my boy. that's corker!" he
said, heartily. "Where did you get it?"
"Listened and heardsome old gossips
tell it, as you told me to do. All I
know is, that it's the escapade of a
woman high in 'local social circles,'
just as I've said."
"Escapade, well I should think so,
and she saves her reputation by having
a midnight supper charged to Mrs.
lI--, who it not in a position to ob
ject."
"Of course i had to exaggerate it a
trifle-touch up the high lights, you
know."
"And darken the shadows. Well,
that's what we want, and you've hit it
the Tr'st time. Only if we could give
the name of the woman whe did it, or
those of her relatives, it would be
stronger. Don't know it, eh?"
"'No."'
"WVell, the name of the woman she
personated is enough for one scoop, and
we've got that. Perhaps others may
know it, and it'll set'e m to talking."
lie took up his blue pencil and wrote
"m. g." at the top of the page. "Per
haps you'll make a newspaper man
after all, in spite of your college educa
tion-who knows?"
George Stanton seized the manuscript
and hurried off with it to the editorial
den, where he deposited it gleefully
.upon the top of a pile of papers on the
editor's desk. After that, dinner, the
theater, supper, followed in succession,
and at midnight he tried to possess
himself with patience to await the ar
rival of the paper which would contain
his maiden effort in journalism.
An overwhelming disappointment
awaited him. For, when he unfolded
the sheet, not a line of his production
could he find. After searching several
times through time sixteen pages of the
paper, the conviction was forced upon
him-it had been omitted.
lie hastened to his uncle's office, for,
although it was Sunday morning, he
knew he should find him there.
"My article has been omitted," he
announced.
Ilis uncle surveyed the crest-fallen
countenance before him.
"Omitted? I haven't had tin, - to
glance at the paper yet-there's so
much of it-but it can't be possible."
"It is, though. Here's the paper;
look for yourself."
The proprietor glanced hastily tver
the sheet.
"I never knew Bacon to do such a
thing before in all the sever.teen years
he's been on the paper."
"Where is he?"
"Home, I suppose; I haven't seent
him. Ring up the porter and find
out."
The man reported that Mr. Bacot:
had been in his office all nigh', "walk
in' up and down, sor, strange-like. I
axed him wor anyone after him, but
he said 'No.' kinder absent-minded
like, and wint on walkin' up and
down."
Frederick Stanton dismissed the man.
His words had deepened the mystery.
"I can't understand this at all
Come, George, we will find out what it
means."
At the door of the editorial office, a
haggard face confronted them. Mr.
Bacon silently ushered in his visitors
and closed the door.
"I sent you some stuff last night,
Bacon," said Frederick Stanton, "and
I've come to hear your explanation-if
you can give one-as to why you kept
it back."
The man addressed began to pace the
room nervously.
"It was about-a woman," he said,
finally.
"Well, what of it?" demanded his su
perior. "IIer name wasn't mentioned,
though it ought to have been, and if it
had been, is that any reason why you
should scruple to publish what I send
in? You've never hesitated before over
such a trifle as a woman's reputation."
There was an ominous pause.
"We may as well understand one an
other first as last," the speaker contin
ued. "It will never do for an editor to
doubt the policy of an owner. You
would be asking my reasons next. If
you are to presume to dictate to me, we
may as well sever our connections at
once."
The man addressed staggered slight
ly. IIis face paled and a hunted look
came into his eyes.
"It was only a woman's reputation
that was at stake," he said, quietly,
"but the woman was--nmy wife!"-John
H-owe Bargate, in San Francisco Argo

Too Short Notice.
Old Mlr. Johnson, familiarly known
as "Uncle Zeke," was so fond of his
coppers as to have acquired the reputa
tion of being a "leetle nigh," but he
was also fond of creature comforts
Sometimes it taxed his ingenuity to
reconcile these conflicting tastes. The
citizens of Milltown were noted for
getting up entertainments of a social
and edible nature, called "aubscription
parties," and Uncle Zeke was almost
invariably one of the participants. He
satisfied his desire for economy, how
ever, by fasting for a certain length of
time beforehand. On one occasion a
party was hastily artanged in honor of
some transient guest 6f the town, and
Uncle Zek'e was informed of the affair
on the forenoon of the very dlay on
which the entertainment was to be
given. "No, no," said the old man,
emphatically. "I should have ben
happy to go if you'd gin me mnore
notice. You gin'rally charge abomt four
times what it's wuth, anyway, but if I
have a chance to git ready. I can gitl
about half my money's wuth! As it l,

FOREIGN GOSSIP.
-The discovery of petroleum at Ash
wick, Somersetshire, England, some
weeks ago, has led to a general pros
pecting of the regio, and oil has been
struck in fifteen places within five or
six miles of the original strike. They
are all in the same geological forma
tion.
-The bite of a strange cat, which he
had casually stroked, and which turned
on him, caused the death of a young
man in London two weeks ago. The
bite healed, and he had almost forgot
ten the occurrence, when a month later
symptoms of hydrophobia developed,
and he died .in convulsions six days
later.
-The pegging out of mining claims
is going on igorously in Mlatabele
land, in the region from which the na
tive owners were driven at the muzzles
of the Maxim guns but a few months
ago, and the process from tranisforma
tion from savage barbarism to frontier
civilization is proceeding at a remark
able pace.
--lehanzin, the ex-king of Dahomney,
recently deposed by the French, is to
be exiled to the West Indian island of
Martinique. lie will be sent there
very shortly. The climate of that is
land will be about the same as that of
his native land, and le will enjoy a
great amount of liberty, as it would be
a hard matter, in the event of an at
tempt at escape, for him to reach his
former kingdom.
-The ex-president of the Royal col
lege of veterinary surgeons of En
gland says public drinking troughs
for horses are a curse to horseflesh, as
they spread farcy and glanders. A
considerable ventilation of the matter
is in progress, and it seems to be con
ceded by experts that tile danger is in
the contact of the horses' months and
not so much in their using the same
trourghs. Troughs with separate coinm
partments are recommended.
-After many years of hard fighting,
the Sunday opening of picture galleries
in London has been conceded by the
common council, but only through the
casting vote of the lord mayor. Thie
council stood eighty-eight in favor and
eighty-eight against the motion, and
it was amid much excitement that the
lord mayor gave his casting vote. A
motion to recind the resolution will
come np at. the next meeting, and the
Sabbatarians yet hope to triumph.
-The Liverpool electric elevated
railway, which has been in existence
about a year, has proved completely
successful in operation. It is five miles
long, and its total cost, including
equipment and all other charges, has
been five hundred and fifty thousand
pounds. A five-minute service of trains
is maintained with perfect regularity,
and so far without mishapof any kind.
On a recent holiday forty thousand
passengers were carried in eight hours.
-French imports in 1893 amounted
in value to 3,936,000,000 francs. It was
the first time in ten years that they
had fallen below 4,000,000,000 francs.
In l9l1 they amountecd to exactly tie
latter sum, but in 1891 they were 4,767,
000.000 francs. The exports last year
amounted to 3,209,000,000 francs, which
is lower than any year since 1885. The
decline, both in exports and imports,
applies to all countries with which
France has trade except Italy. from
which country there was a slight in
crease in imports.
--1When Prof. Garner planned his
expedition to Africa in search of the
language of the great apes, lie hoped
to take with him a curious letter of in
troduction to a savage negro chieftain.
The letter was in the form of a phono
graph message in the chief's own lan
guage from E.. .I. Glave, Stanley's
young lieutenant. (;lave commends
Garner to the good offices of the savage
warrior, and as Glave's voice is well
known to the chieftain, the message
would doubtless have been effective;
but Garner by ill-luck failed to receive
the phonograph before leaving En
gland.
LOCUSTS IN SYRIA.
The Renmarkable vcene Witnessed by a
Noted Oricntallat.
We were sitting on the hills with our
backs turned to the west wind, which
was softly blowing from the Mediter
ranean. The horses were picketed
2lose by, grazing the sweet mountain
grass. The Arabs of our caravan were
cooking a "pillaw" a little distance off.
Around us were laid out tile where
withals of a light lunch, among which
wwas an open marmalade jar.
I was thinking of Ahab, and wonder
ing how he could put up so long with
Elijah, especially when, on this very
spot. -the prophet said to the king,
"As the Lord livetlh in this place where
dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall
clogs lick thy blood-even thine"
when .uddenly riglht into the marmna
lade there dropped" what 1 tools
for a large grasshopper. It was yel
low and green with long jump
ing legs and a big head, and
while I was taking it out of the
jar two others fell into a plate of souD,
andl a half dozen more of the same kind
upon a dish of salad. At thie same mo
ment Imy horse stamped violently,'a.ndl
I saIw more of thesCe grasshoppers pelt
ing his hocks and haunches. Turning
round to find whence this insect wer
came. I witnessed what was to 'hWe an
extraordinary spectacle, though com
mon enough, of course, in the east. A
large cloud, denser in its lower than its
upper part, filled an eighth part of the
western hemicycle. The remoter por
tion of it was as thick, as brown and
brumnous as a London fog. The nearer
side opened suddenly up into millions
and billions and trillions and sextil
lions of the same green and yellow in
sects pelting in a close-winged crowd
quite as thickly as flakes of snow upon
all the 'hillsides far and - near. You
could not stand a moment against the
aggressive and offensive rain of these
buzzing creatures. The horses even
swung themselves round and stood
with lowerd crests, taking tile storm
upon their backs and flanks.
You had to turn up thie collar of
your coat to keep them out of your
neck and button the front not to have
nvoEr pt'eh.t f111ed with .the 1rpuaive;
swarm, which in two minutes had so
peppered the whole scene round about
that its color and character were en
tirely altered. Every little creature
of the interminable flight on alighting
veered himself round head to wind on
the earth, just as if he had dropped
anchor and swung to the breeze; and.
it swas curious to notice that the gen
eral tint of the ground of their count
less bodies was brown if you looked to
windward and green if you gazed to
leeward. But very quickly the only
green to be seen round about was the
hue afforded by this sudden invasion.
Even while we prepared to yield up
the spot to them and pack our lunch
.baskets for departure they had cleared
off grass and leaves and every verdant
thing around: and when they arose
again from the soil. or from any
clump of trees, in a hungry throng,
the place they quitted had already as
sumed a barren and wintry aspect.
The Syrian peasants passing along the
roads were beating their breasts and
cursing the ill-fortune of the plague.
Some of them, none the less, gathered
up a cloth full of the noxious things,
for the locust is distinctly edible. Halt
in wrath and revenge, and half for a
novelty in diet, the Arabs to this day
eat a few of them, roasting them in
wire nets or in earthen vessels over a
slow fire till the wings and legs drop
off and the locust becomes crisp, in
which state it tastes, as I am able to
say from personal experience, some
thing like an unsalted prawn. But ii
seemed as if, had all Syria and the
globe itself taken to living on locusts
they would have hardly made a sensi
ble mark upon the extraordinary num
ber that drifted that day over our
heads.-Sir Edwin Arnold, in London
Telegraph.
LINCOLN PARDONED HIM.
The Presildent Took the Risk on the Side ol
Mlercy.
lion. II. L. Dawes. in some recollec
tions of Lincoln and Stanton, relates
an experience of his own in dealing
with these two men, who, "so wholly
unlike in ways of work and thought,
walked together arm in arm, each sus
tained in the load he carried by the
arm he leaned on, and ]lelped on his
way by the caution a counsel of him
who walked by his side." A quarter
master of a Massachusetts regiment
had been caught galnblingr with gov
ernment money, and hiad been ren
tenced to live years' imprisonment in
the Albany penitentiary. Says Mr.
Dawes:
'-I had received a petition to the
president, signed-by many leading citi
rens of the neighborhood of the offen
der's home, indorsed and certified to
by the physician of the penitentiary,
and also by a leading physician of my
own town, tasking for his pardon on
the ground of failing health, and repre
senting him to be in a sad condition of
decline, with every prospect of a
speedy death unless he were released.
"I took this petition to M'r." Lincoln,
who, after carefully reading it, turned
to me afid said :
'" 'Do you believe that statement?'
" 'Certainly I do, Mr. P'resident, or I
should not have brought it to you.'
"'Please say so here on the back of
it, under these doctors.'
"I did as requested, adding: 'And be
cause I believe it to be true I join in
this petition.'
"As I signed my name Mr. Lincoln
remarked, 'We can't permit the man to
die in prison after that statement,' and
imnmediately wrote under it all:
" 'Let this man be discharged. A. L.'
"He handed the paper back to me,
and told me to take it to the war office
and give it to Mr. Stanton. Ie saw at
once something in my countenance
which led him to think that I had al
ready encountered some rough weather
in that quarter, and had little relish
for more. Mr. Lincoln took back the
paper, and smiling, remarked that he
was going over there pretty soon, and
would take it himself.
"Tihe next tday, on going to the
house. I was met by two Michigan
representatives with the inquiry'
'What have, you been doing at the
White House? We wentthere to get a
poor M'ichigan soldier pardoned who
had been sentenced to death for deser
tion, but we couldn't do anything with
the president. lie told us that you
were there yesterday, and got him to
pardon a man out of the penitentiary,
and when he took the paper to Mr.
Stanton lie wouldn't discharge him.
" ' "lie told me." said the president,
"that it was a sham, and that l)awes
had got me to pardon the biggest ras
cal in the army, and that I had made
gamnbling with the funds perfectly
safe. I couldn't get him to let the man
off. The truth is, I have been doing
so much of this thing lately that I
have lost all influence with this ad
mninistration, and have got to stop.
"'I went imlnediately to the Vhite
house, with my hair on end, but was
greeted by the president in thie mildest
mainner. I inquired if the pardon had
gone out. le replied that it had not,
and then recounted, in his quaint way,
the scene in the war office.
'" said to him that I could not afford
to have this matter rest on any uncer
tainty. 'Retain this pardon, send a
messalge to Albany, and make certain
thie truth or falsity of this statement
at my expense, if we have been imposed
uipon.' IMr. Lincoln's reply was:
" 'I think, if you believe it, I will.
At any rate, I will take the risk on the
side of mercy.'
"So the pardon went oun t. And yet
the sequel proved that Mr. Stanton
was the nearest rightof the three; for.
on my return to Massachusetts, almost
the first man who greeted me in the
street was the same 'dying' quarter
master, apparently as hale and robust
as the best of the people around him."

THE WOODS OF VALOIS.
A Ioysml asme Preserve wVhere Fragrant
Lites Grew.
Chantilly is the game-preserve of a
hunter-prince. and everything about it
Is ordered for the chase. Those wide
open glassy glades, studded with birch
or oakserub, are" haunted by the deer,
and in those thickets of golden broom
the heavy does prepare their nurseries.
Great, floundering, russet pheasants
come flying by; at every step a hare or
a white-tailed rabbit starts up out of
the grass. At the further end of the
forest there are deep, unsightly thick
ets of mud and thorn, left darkling
amid the trim order of the place, for
the wild boar delights in them. As we
walk or drive down the neat-clipt ave
nues of the forest the roads appear im
passable to the traveler, and we won
der at the contrast between their shoals
of sand and the careful forestry that
pares and cuts every wilding branch of
the over-arching horn-beam roof. Blut
the roads are bad on purpose: every
spring they are plowed afresh, lest they
lose the lightness beloved of the horse
man.
Every Mfay a beautiful fault frus
trates this skillful venery, for, thick as
grass, thick and sweet, the lily of the
valley springs in all the brakes and
shady places. The scent of the game
will not lie across these miles of blos
som. The hunters are in despair and
the deer, still deafened with the win
ter's yelp of the hounds-the deer, who
sets his back against the sturdiest oak
and butts at the pack with his antlers,
who swims the lakes and from his
island refuge sells his life as hard as
he can-the deer, accustomed to be al
ways vanquished, beholds himself at
last befriended by an ally more in
vincible than water or forest oak, by
the sweet, innumerable white lily, in
nocent as himself, that every 1Maytime
sends the huntsmen home.

THE IGUANA.
An Amusing Incident of Anlmanl Life in
South Amerlca.
Snakes have many enemies. MIr. IV.
H. lludson writing of animal life on
the great South American pampas,
where there are many kinds of snakes,
both venomous and non-venomous,
says that their enemies are legion.
One of them is the armadillo, which
appears to have no fear whatever of
snake venom. Burrowing owls feed
largely on snakes, and the same is true
of herons and storks. But perhaps the
most notable of snake-killers is the
large lizard known as the iguana.
The iguana is no mean adversary, as
may be judged from the fact that dogs
which attack one sometimes come off
with a broken leg.
The lizard does not wait for the
snake to take tle offensive, but goes
swiftly in pursuit, and being very rapid
in-its motions, seldom has any difli
culty in overtaking its victim, which it
despatches by blows of its powerful
tail.
A friend of Mr. Hudson was out rid
ing after his cattle. His lasso was at
tached to the saddle, and the end
trailed along the ground after him.
A big iguana lay in the sun, appa
rently asleep. It paid no attention
to the horse as it passed. but the next
instant it raised its head and fixed its
attention on the forty feet of lasso
slowly trailing by.
Suddenly it rushed after the rope,
and dealt it a succession of violent
blows with its tail. When the whole
of the lasso, several yards of which
had been pounded in vain, had been
dragged by, the lizard, with uplifted
head, continued gazing after it with
the greatest astonishment. Never be
fore had such a wonderful snake
crossed its path.--Youth's Companion
A Tough Burro.
"A burro is as hard to kill as a cat,"
said a locomotive engineer the other
day. "When I was running on the
Santa Fe out of Trinidad I had a pecul
iar experience with one of them. -I
was pulling the express, and struc'k
one of the little fellows before I saw
him. He doubled up like a sheep and
went under the pilot. I reversed at
once. bringing the train to a stop. Mly
fireman and the brakeman got down to
pull the pieces off the track. The
burro was wedged tightly under the
fire-box. After tugging at him for ten
minutes the boys succeeded in pulling
him from his unpleasant position. I.
of course, thought he was dead. You
can imagine when the critter jumped
up, shook itself and at once trotted off
into the sage brush and cactus. The
next trip back I saw the animal. It
was a little stiff in its forelegs, but
otherwise was uninjured. How it got
under the pilot and under the fire-box
without being crushed to death I could
never figure out."- St. Louis Globe
Democrat.
Chinese Dades and lashers.
China is perhaps the last place in the
world where one would expect to find
dudes and mashers, but it appears that
in Shanghai the gilded youth among
the celestials have adopted the masker
costume. Very curious they look in
their high collars and tight-fitting
coats. They have also taken to wear
ting foreign underclothing, eating for
eign foods, smoking foreign tobacco
and doing many other things contrary
to the old-fashioned Chinese usage.
They also ride in foreign carriages,
men and women together, and some of
them live in foreign houses in grand
style. There are also hundreds of
schools kept by Chinese, where nothing
but English is taught, that being con
sidered the most useful language.

WOMWESTIC CONCERNS.
-As good a way as any to keep catu
sage is to pack it solidly in a stone pot.
lay a plate on it, place a clean weight
on the plate and set the pot in the oven
until thoroughly heated through. The
grease cooking out of the meat will en
tirely cover the plate; remove the
weight when you take it from the
oven, leaving the lard to harden over
tie plate, and thus serve the meat.
-English Plum Pudding: Two
pounds each of bread crumbs, chopped
suet, light brown sugar, raisins (seed
ed), and currants, one-half pound of
sliced citron, four grated nutmegs, six
eggs, one tablespoonful of salt, the
juice and grated rind of three lemons.
M ix all the fruit thoroughly, then add .
the eges and milk and tile rest of the
ingredients. Fill the bowls even fiall
cover with cloths tied over tightlylpd
boil steadily eight hours. When want
ed for use boil one hour. It will keep
all winter.--Good Housekeeping.
-Cream Pie-Crust: I have never seen
a recipe for making pie-crust with
cream, so will give mine, which is
healthy and easily digested, also
quicker made than'with butter or lard,
which most farmers' wives will appre- .
ciate. Trake asrnuch rich sour cream
as will be needed for the pie dough you
are going to make, add soda to make
light, but not quite as munch as for bis
cult: mix as stiff as can he handled and
roll the under crust not too thin, as it
is crip and brittle when baked and also
good.-Farm, Field and Firesid ".
-Snowed Eggs: leat the whites of
six eggs to a stiff froth with two table
spoonfuls of powdered sugar. Sweeten
and flavor to taste a pint of milk; set
over the fire and when it reaches the
Suloiling point drop in the beaten whites,
spoonful by spoonful, taking them out
as soon as they set and laying in a
glass dish. Remove the milk to one
side of the fire and when it cools a lit
tle stir in the beaten yolks very slow
ly. As soon as this becomes thick
pour over the snowed eggs and serve
immediately, that they may be eaten
hot.-American Agriculturist.
-Pieplant Shortcake: To one quart
of flour add one-half a teaspoon of salt,
and one scant teaspoon of soda; sift
flour three times, and then rub into it
two tablespoons of lard or nice drip
pings: add sour milk or buttermilk un
til it s like biscuit dough. Divide it
into two portions, roll them a little
thinner than biscuits, and place one
above the other on a tin, lightly
spreading the lower one with butter,
so they will separate easily. When
baked, separate the layers, and be
tween them and on top, spread hot
pieplant sauce.--Housekeeper.
S--Orange Charlotte: *Line the sides of
a border mold carefully with greased
paper. Weigh five eggs, take their
weight in sugar and half their weight -
in flour. Beat the yolks io-the-eggs
thoroughly, add the sugar and beat
again. Add the grated rind of half a
lllediterranean orange and a table
spoonful of the juice. Add the whites
beaten to a stiff froth and then stir in
the flour gradually and thoroughly
Pour the cake mixture into a mold and
hbake in a moderate oven. When cold
turn out upon the dish in which it is to
be served. Fill the center of the cake
with whipped cream flavored witht
orange and a tablespoonful of mnars
schino, or two tablespoonfuls of sherry.
Serve with a border of whipped cream.

JEWELRY AND SILVERWARE.
Fashionable Fads and Noveltles Now Seen
In the Shops.
Huge twisted silver rings are made of
hold towels.
Enamel tablets are the latest devel
opment for the chatelaine.
New loving cups have spiral handles;
these are very ornamental. -
GO-aceful watering pots of silver are
to be used as vases for flowers.
Princeeof WVales feathers in silver are
entering a bid for popularity.
The wreath as pin and chatelnine is
putting on new leaves for the spring.
• Standards of perforated silver are
made to hold fan screens for lamp or
fire.
A new silver key ring is a key with
a handle large enough to hold other
keys.
The chameleon, which in its live state
has been the latest fad, is seen now in
decorative silver.
Oval platinum sleeve buttons, highly
polished, with a raised broken edge of
gold, are new lld chaste. . -
Perforated silver balls in Int'san
workmanship are seen on ivory rf n
and are intended to amuse the baby.
Silver cribbage boards are shown n-; th -
small drawers for the cards. Silver
checker boards have red and Wu-
spaces for checkers.
In England the new Order of the
Opal, a society designed to discourtg.
superstition, will doubtless give new
vogue to the stone, which is its badge.
The sword wiH keep its popularity
for the next season. None of the new
swordsare prettier than those with the
twisted enamel handles. All swordsot
value should have a guard. The hilt
makes them top heavy, and they easily
come out without some precaution.
It is safe to say that the life of the
man who carries an umbrella now
prominently exhibited will not be
worth having. It has a handle of
mounted gold. Around this a snake
is wound, whose eye is a tremendous
solitaire diamond. Another great dia
mond is sunk in the top of the handle.
The ferrule is of gold and this has a
large diamond just below the silk.
Queen Victoria might carry such an
umbrella when she goes shopping, but
even she would need the guards as an
escort to keep away thieves and mand
baggers.--Jeweler's Weekly.
