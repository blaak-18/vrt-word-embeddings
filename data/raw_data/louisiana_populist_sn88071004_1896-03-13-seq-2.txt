On lat Thursday our neighbor
across the street created quite a
sensation among the sombre in
habitants of the quiet little city of
Natchitoches. In a double-leaded
editorial under the caption of
HIARK ! our neighblor grew frantic
and hysterical, If not eloquent, in
their denunciation of the fact that
Blount and Lewis had been ap
pointed by some commnittee in the
city of New Orleans to represent
them in the parish of Natchitoches.
From our neighbors wild ex
claimings we believed that Blount
and Lewis were about to swoop
down upon the city and lead the
frightened Democracy into captiv
ity.
We immediately busied oursel yes
upon inquiry into the fact, and
were pleased to soon learn that
these colored citizens were quietly
pursuing the "even tenor of their
way."
Believe us, frightened Democ
racy, if these two colored citizens
capture you and carry you to the
jungles of Sibley's Lake, we will
rescue you at the peril of getting
lost in the woods to find you.
Hark I Blount and Lewis, you
must tread gently, as you pass
frightened Democracy, and Hark !
if you capture that grand cohort
of Corporals, Colonels, Majors and
Generals of the staff of Democra
cy, you will have to answer for it
to the brave yeomanry that rescu
ed this parish in 1879, for they
still live in the hills of North Lou
isiana, and they stand ready to
"take your black heel off the
white necks" of the Democracy
of the city of Natchitoclies.
Down with white primaries !
Long live white supremacy !!

No Cause for Alarm.
If the Democracy of this parish
is sincere in their desire for white
supremacy, we will kindly sug
gest in a neighborly way to our
neihbor, the Enterprise, that they
desist from giving so much impor
tance to the colored voter. The
Populist party has proven their
sincerity for white rule I y offering
the Democracy a white primary,
and promising to abide by the re
sult.
We are also of the opinion that
the rank and file of the l)Eimocra
cy are willin. that the white people
should control the affairs of this
parish. It is true that our n igh
hor parish on the north, DIeSoto,
the colored voter was allowed to
participate in the Democratic pri
mary; and it is also true that on
our west, in our neighbor parish
Grant, the I)emocracy and some
colored leaders have agreed upon a
ticket that is satisfactory to the
Democracy and the colored voter,
and it is also true that in Red Riv
er, it is the proud boast of the
Democracy that every colored man
within its border always votes the
Democratic ticket, however, we
believe that even all this has not
yet polluted the rank and file of
the Democracy of the parish of
Natchitoches. Therefore neighbor
Enterprise, why grow frantic in
your appeal for white supremacy
in this parish I It would be well
for you to devote your energies to
the parishes where your party
votes the colored man, The last
two elections in this parish were
practically the voice .f the white
people.
The colored voter has come to
the conclusion long since that the
white people nmust and will control
the affairs, and if they are let alone
they will voluntarily stay away
from the polls; they recognize the
fact that their votes are not count
ed as cast, and so are averse to
participating in elections. The
best course to pursue is a quiet,
but determined action to obtain the
will of the white people.
The wild shrieks of the Enter
prise on negro domination fall up
on deaf ears in the hills of North
Louisiana, these bravo people have
no fear of the negro controlling
them, and ever stand ready to en
force the will of the white people.
If the Enterprise will quit giving
so much importance to the colored
voter, and let him alone he will
stay away from the polls, but your
continual howling and tone of
fright, my good neighbor, has a
tendency to lead the colored man
into the belief that he can go to
the polls armed with a corncob and
lightning-bug, and ran the Democ
racy. Be brave neighbor, the
colored man will not be allowed to
bulldoze the Democracy.

grand outporing of l)emocracy"
at Bayou Natchez, on Saturday,
March 7th. The "large andenthu
eiastic meeting" passed a set of
hair-raising resolutions that went
into detail of the universal slaugh
ter that was to come; the resolu
tions were unanimously adopted,
so we presume the colored voter
present voted for their own execu
tion. A party that was present
informs us that there were 20
white and 12 colored voters in the
grand rally, Jas. Jones, Sam.

dressed a small Populist meeting
at PFee's school house,. ward 4, on

there were presents only 81 white

"G(ive the People the Fact.," is
the capton of an article in the En
terpise, and it says that the "Pop
ibt Leaders" would not publish
the answer of hittle Charlie Porter
to the white primary proposition.
Now Charlie, we would not publish
your answer becanuse your reasns
for refusing the propmoion were
ridiculous, and we did mnot care to
hold you up for ridioule to the
pubioin our paper. Twas pity

The w rthy Chairman dealt with
the r, solution in a Democratic
manner. The cause of free silver
was mentioned once. Judge Hunt
ter said "Capt. Pharr is a free sil
ver man." From a Democratic
standpoint the meeting was a how
ling success.
Some Unwritten History.
The "School Question" with
Foster and his cohorts is like all
other questions with them, for po
litical show, and to be used for
what it will bring. The education
of the masses is the secondary con
sideration. This was exemplified in
1894, when Blanchard exerted him
self, with Foster's aid, to transfer
his beaming talent, as well as his
luxurious whiskers, from the floor
of the House of Congress to the
august Senate. At that time the
Farmers' Alliance was dead against
Blanchard, and Foster's power
was invoked and eagerly supplied
to land the North Louisiana end of
the Lafayette combine.
The State Normal School at
Natchitoches had grown beyond the
most sanguine expectations of its
friends and promoters ; appropria
tions were needed to accommodate
the demands upon it front the pub
lie all over Louisiana, and to ex
tend its greatness and usefulness.
Buildings must be erected, corn
potent instructors must be added
to the already competent but over
worked corps; modern appliances
and help to educate were impera
tiuely necessary. How then did
this great advocate of public edu
cation conduct himself I
He made this school, the future
hope of our State for competent
instructors for our youth, part of
the stock in trade with which to
secure Blanchard's election to the
Senate.
This ms an open secret that no
one denied then nor can it be de
nied now.
This great educational champion
then proceeded to build up the In
dustrial College at Ruston by sac
rificing the School at Natchitoches,
and perhaps permanently destroy
ing its purposes and usefulness.
That the Ruston Industrial Col
lege is an institution worthy -the
pride and patronage of our State
none will deny, and the Item will
be found ready at all times to aid
the endeavors of that worthy in
stitution, but the influences used to
secure its first appropriation were
those embramoed in the bargain and
arle of votes for a United States
Senator.
The "rufled anger"of the Farm
era' Alliance advocates was sooth
edwith the assurancee of a great
industrial school, planted amidst
the hills and vales of North Lou
isiana, at which his chikdren could
receive an eduestion beitting the
station of an intelligent agrioultu
rlist, mechaic or artisan.
Coaternation prevailed, hower
er, with the State Normal School
people. Their hopes ad desires
were blasted, mad its president re
urned to Natchitoch errnelly dis.
appointed and well nsgh hopelesbr.
The Seate deal had boilt sn in
dustrial school at rste., perhaps
swamped the State Normal School
at Natchlitoekes, but the main ob
leot had been achieved-Blanchard
had, with Fosterb ald, won the
seveord PQ-.

It was at this moment that Gov.

to Baton Rouge and save the Nor

one knowing the man would hesi
tate to answer. His friends in
both houses were rallied and urged
to effort, and that institution flour
ishes to-day, not because Foster
did aught to prevent its distruc
tion, but because the maligned Mc- g
Enery and his friends rescued it
from the effects of an infamous
and perhaps corrupt senatorial

DIED t
BABERS-At the home of her
parents, on Cane river, March 7th,
1896, Miss LuL BAmsas; about
sixteen years of age.
Her sickness was of short du
ration. She having been danger
ously ill only a few hours before
her death. She was just entering
upon the threshold of womanhood,
and her future hopes of life and
happiness were very bright. When
viewed in number of years, her
life seemed a short one, but these
years were full of incidents of 1
tenderness and kindness, and her
influence among her associates will
bear fruit for a good many years
to come.
In her quiet and gentle way she
won the esteem and gained the
confidence of all who knew her.
May the sad hearts of the family
and friends be comforted in the
thought that there is a time when
we shall meet where there will be
no more disappointments, no more
sickness, no more separation.
The funeral was conducted by
Rev. M. M. E. Weaver, on Sunday,
3 p. m. at the Cane river Bap
tist church, where a large on.
course of people assembled to pay
their respects to the remains of
her whome spirit the Lord had aell
ed from earth to the abode of the
blessed in heaven.
