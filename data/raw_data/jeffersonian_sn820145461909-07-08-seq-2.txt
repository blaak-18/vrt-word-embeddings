LOVE TH A T ENDURED nelue gillmore
JIE RAIN came down in a
solid sheet, making rivers of
the streets, and causing the
gutters to seethe like whirl-
t
pools. Even the horses were stum
bling along blindly with downcast
heads pressed against the strangling
whip of water. The great, bare
branched oaks swayed and creaked,
helplessly flinging their limbs to
right and left like giant arms in
mute supplication, and everywhere
were prostrate fences and fragments
of woodwork, wrenched from the
houses and flung ruthlessly to the
earth.
But Dorothy still persevered vali
antly against the fury of the storm.
Anything, all things—seemed prefer
able to the suffocating atmosphere of
her room, where she had spent three
fourths of the night in wretched
wakefulness and battle. Her rain
coat was soaked through and
through, and beat about her ankles
as though held down by leaden
weights. Her hat had long ago suc
cumbed to the rain and hung over
her face in an unrecognizable mass;
beneath it, her hair, loosened by the
wind, blew in a tangle of wet gold
about her shoulders, and her face
looked white and set and bitter.
She seemed as one suddenly awaken
ed from a horrible dream; 1 in reality,
she had awoke to find the dream all
too true.
She clenched her hands and bit
her lip hard as she plunged on
through the driving rain, and every
now and then, she caught her breath
in a little dry sob, her eyes aching
almost beyond endurance because of
the tears that would not come.
Once her foot slipped, and she put
out her hand for support against the
dripping wall of a building. She
stood still a moment, trying to pene
trate the gloom ahead of her. Less
than ten feet away, she saw the tall
form of a man leaning against a
lamp-post. His hat was drawn down
over his eyes, but the look of them,
keen, gray—inscrutable, was printed
on her heart with indelible distinct
ness; and his clean, hard chin, with
the little cleft in the center —his res
olute mouth, and straight, sensitive
nose —that last whole expression of
intense sadness and reproach—she
should never forget them to her dy
ing day!
A minute passed, two —three. The
rain held up a little and Dorothy
hurried on with rapid, nervous foot
steps and averted head.
But Camden had already seen and
recognized her. As she passed him,
he turned and matched his step with
hers. He took the umbrella from
her quietly and they walked on a lit
tle way in silence. At last he spoke.
“After everything between us,’’ he
began, steadying his voice by an ef
fort and breaking at once into the
subject, “I could not bear to think
that our final parting should be re
membered always in anger and bit
terness.’’
The girl’s lip quivered but she
made no reply.
“They told me at home,’’ he went
on, “that you had started in this di
rection, so I have been waiting for
you. I have been thinking over
everything,” he continued calmly,
“and I begin to see now that it can’t
be helped that Providence has seen
fit to make this disposition of our
lives—and lo"Ve.”
A sudden spasm of relief crossed
Dorothy’s face, and a light gleamed
for a moment through the sadness
of her eyes.
“God knows it’s hard enough for
me,” Camden was saying hoarsely,
“but your part is even worse. Doro
thy! Can you ever forgive me those
brutal words of last night?”
Scorching tears welled up to the
girl’s eyes, but she tried to smile
them away as she slipped her arm in
his with a little gesture of mute as
surance.
“I had already forgiven them,”
she said, a little tremor in her voice,
“even before they were uttered. They
never yould have been —had you
cared —less.”
Camden was very pale, and though
inw r ardly tortured, his next words
and tone were perfectly quiet.
“I hope your mother is better to
day, Dorothy?”
“Much, much better now,” she an
swered absently. Then her face
brightened and her teeth showed in
a quick smile beneath the fresh
young lips.
“Bob,” she said tremulously, “God
will not frown upon me for this act
of renunciation. Had I refused her
this life-long hope and scheme—in
her present critical condition —I
tremble to think of the result. You
—you see how it is, dear?”
“I understand, Dolly.”
“I could not take my own moth
er’s life in my hands —even though
the best part of my own must be the
penalty.”
“I know, child. Providence has
left you no alternate course.”
“After all, matters might be worse.
Colonel Nelson is a kind, generous
man and—as a friend—l esteem him
highly. Perhaps, in time, I shall
learn to care for him more as—as a
wife should. But the one real love
of my life—he must never know of
that. He is too true and good a man
to let suspect—” she paused, and the
blood flamed into her face. “Tell me,
Bob,” she begged, “ought I to let
him know or not?”
For some time Camden made no
response. His nails sank into his
palms till they drew blood and his
lips whitened. The fearful draught
upon his self-control left him physi
cally weak. But he spoke without
betrayal of it.
“I do not think you are called
upon to tell him, Dolly.”
“It might make some difference
in—”
“Yes, it might; in all probability,
it would. That was my reason for
speaking as I did.”
The girl looked up for an instant
with shadowed eyes, into which had
crept a trace of bewilderment.”
Camden caught his breath sharply.
“God knows I wish —” he began
passionately. Then recollecting him
self, with an abrupt change of tone:
“Dorothy! Don’t you know —can’t
you see that I am doing my level best
to embrace your point of view-—pr
rather, your mother’s?”
Tsl)e. '3tffcrsonian
“Yes. Only—”
“It involves a question of life and
death, and —she is your mother.”
“Yes; she is my mother,” the girl
repeated reverently. After a mo
ment’s pause, she turned to him sud
denly, with an uplifted look. “I
shall be proud all my life of having
loved you,” she said fervently. “You
are the noblest man I have ever
known!”
“I hope that I couldn’t be capable
of any littleness or meanness,” he
replied gravely.
“No. Oh, no; you could never be
that. But I was wondering how many
men under the circumstances would
plead the cause of one who —”
“Your mother is a true daughter
of the Old South, Dolly,” Camden in
terposed quickly. “She lived through
scenes of which neither you nor I
will ever know the whole terrible
truth —and her bitterness against my
countrymen, though prejudiced per
haps, is only natural. And although
it crushes me to the earth to realize
that you can never be mine, I can
only bow my head in approval of
your decision —unselfish, sacrificial
and noble to the highest degree.”
The keen look in his eyes was very
sweet as he finished speaking, and
drew her hand for an instant into
his.
The storm had gradually subsided
and desultory glimpses of the sun
could be had between the hurrying
clouds. They walked on in silence
for nearly a block. At the corner,
Dorothy paused and held out her
hand.
“Goodbye,” she said wistfully.
She looked straight into his gray,
penetrating eyes with her lucid blue
gaze, just now obscured by a swift
rush of tears.
Camden met her glance for a sin
gle instant. His head swam. It was
the end of life for him. The car
riages whirling by, the stripped and
broken trees, the pools of water
standing in the streets and the sud
den mocking glare of sunlight that
flashed over all, rushed past his
brain like the panorama of a restless
dream. His lip trembled for the
fraction of a second, his lashes just
flickered as he crushed her hand in
a last farewell, and the next he
knew of consciousness, he was walk
ing dazedly in a strange part of
town; the sun had slipped away for
the night, and twilight was fast
yielding to a fathomless, star-glit
tered sky. Broken-hearted, he turn
ed wearily and with numb, mechan
ical feet, retraced him steps in silent
gloom.

Ever since Colonel Nelson’s death,
his wife had worn the deepest black.
But today—the first time in four
years—she had lightened her mourn
ing with a bit of old lace at the
throat and wrists, and fastened in
her belt was a faintly fragrant bunch
of violets.
Her hair—once of that indescriba
ble sun-gold tint —had deepened to
a sombre bronze, framing the pale,
delicate face almost too heavily and
imparting to it, in its present quaint
arrangement, a distinctly old-fashion
ed look. The grave, pansy eyes
showed tenderly wistful out of the
shadows encircling them, and the lit
tle droop at the corners of her mouth
took nothing from its beauty. The
straight young shoulders of twenty
years ago were a trifle stooped, but
she carried herself with the erstwhile
inimitable grace, and her head bore
the same exquisite poise as of old.
She was sitting in a deep-cushion
ed rocker, her hands —soft and white
and delicate as snowflakes —resting
passively on the high, red-leather
arms. There was a clear dash of
color in her cheeks now, and her
eyes sparkled as they had not done
for over a decade. She was gazing
dreamily into the fire-place where a
sleepy bed of pink and purple coals
lay huddled, and from time to time,
a smile of ineffable sweetness lighted
up her flower-like face.
In her lap was a freshly opened
letter. Every now and then she
looked down at it, and caught her
breath in a little tension of joy. Fi
nally, she took it up, smoothed out
the sheet, and for the dozenth time
went over the written lines with a
throbbing heart. It was dated from
Korea some two months previous and
ran:
My Dear Dorothy:
In going through an old batch of
papers that had been stowed away in
my trunk for several years, I came
across one containing the announce
ment of Colonel Nelson’s death.
I am writing to you at once and
unconventionally, since my long si
lence must have seemed strange to
you. I regret exceedingly that I
knew nothing of it at the time of
your bereavement, as it should have
been my most earnest effort to tender
every condolence.
Will you not let me hear from you
with assurance of your health and
welfare? And sometime, when my
duty expires here, shall I have your
consent to come to you?
Most earnestly,
ROBERT CAMDEN.
In due time, an answer went over
the seas.
Dear Bob:
Your letter fills me with inexpressi
ble gladness. Gladness that you are
alive —and that your thoughts are of
me.
Os the past, let us not speak. It
has not been without its joys and
pleasures, as well as sorrows and
pain. But of the future! Dear
friend, I am afraid to bid you come.
Twenty years is a great while, and
there have been changes—many,
many of them. The woman of thir
ty-eight is very different to the girl
of eighteen. And you would find me
even more aged than my years. The
Autumn has come early to me while
doubtless you are yet in the Sum
mertime of your life.
But write often to me—long let
ters, telling of your life, yourself—
everything, and I shall find my great
est happiness in answering.
Sincerely, DOROTHY.
My Own Dear Dorothy:
For you are mine, are you not?
Your words give me the right to say
it, and a thousand years can make no
difference, if Love is not dead! I
kiss your dear lips from afar, and
thus consecrate the remaining years
of my life to worship of you—even
as the past years have been.
There is something I must tell you
when we meet—of the faithful little
woman who lived to brighten my
lonely life but one short year, and
the brown-eyed boy she left behind.
