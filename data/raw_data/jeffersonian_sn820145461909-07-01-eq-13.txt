Sketches From Roman History
The warfare that is being carried
on today against class legislation has
aroused a keen interest in this little
book, in which Mr. Watson deals
with the heroic land reformers of
Rome, the great slave revolt, the
tribune of the people, the brilliant
leader of the aristocrats, and other
dramatic scenes in the history of
Rome. Price 50 cents.

any lease contract. Not long ago, a
tender hearted New York woman who
had no children of her own took for
adoption a little waif. She was
promptly notified that her family was
at once under the ban of the New
York land-lord. Indignantly she
sought legal redress but was informed
by the captain of a police precinct,
we believe, that she and her husband
must either give up their home or the
child. “Very well,” she blazed, “you
can just take care of the baby your
self!” and she left the unfortunate
child upon the lap of the bewildered
gentleman.
The unnatural animals who hate
the ordinary noise of ordinary kidlets
ought to be colonized somewhere in
the middle of the Sahara desert
where they can nurse their everlast
ing “nerves,” gossip, beat the piano,
over-eat and over-dress to their
hearts’ content.

Formerly, these were disposed of “to
the best interests of the service,”
which meant that they were either
sold, to have their lives tortured out
of them by hardships at the hands of
owners unable to buy anything but
decrepit animals, or were killed out
right. Now, they are to be cared for
humanely until they die natural
deaths. Every animal lover will feel
personally grateful for Secretary Na
gel’s “policy” which will at least set
a good example of kindness to dumb
brutes. If there is one reform that
should appeal to every heart, it is
that of making it impossible for
there to be one single over-worked,
half-starved, thrist - tormented or
abused animal in all the bright world
where water is free and food, but for
man’s cruelty, would be abundant.
Mr. Nagel’s “sentimentality” in this
regard is of the right kind, whatever
else he does, or may not do, in his
official career. And what a contract
between such a spirit of humanity
and the coarse, brutal “sporting” pro
clivities of Roosevelt! Few African
hunters will shoot a monkey, because
the little creatures,-it is said, cry so
much like suffering babies not many
men have the lack of heart necessary
to wound them. Mr. Roosevelt has
no such stupid qualms. And, among
the list of game he has so bravely
bagged is the pet gazelle of some
small children! Evidently, by slaugh
tering the neighborhood pets, one
does not indulge in bloodthirsty
sport, but becomes a “faunal natu
ralist.”
