Bwixi,. With proper arrange- r
menets, sows mniay Ilhe bred wh\lnever
it is desirabl;' to h:'ve the pigs. A 11"
sow should be a machlie fir produi
cing pigs, and the more wor k ill this
way she is ni;de to do, the more
money is t:ade. 'I'lhere may he1 two
litters in the year. Spring pigs for
the summiner of fall mat ket, and Au
gust pigs for the holilays.
VAtuM l'srxs.-B- y and by every
good fali mer ill finid fuel to lie cheap
er in tihe winter than food, :lad in a
warm pen, pigs may lhe raised in the
depth of winter. 'T'lose who can
take care of pigs in Fefrrnary, may
couplel their sows now : othlers. should
avoid it. VWhen a pig, of any good
breed, can be miiade to weigh :300 lbs.
in 10 or 12 months, there is loss in
keeping any but bleeding animals
over that age.
Fattening Pigs slould be pushed
on as rapidly as possible before the
cold weather. A pound of fat tnade
now, costs less than that nmade next
month, aind that costs less than the
sanic made in Deceniber. Rememan
ber that cold weather wastes fat.
Moderately Fat animals are the
fi')st pirofitable. Every excessively
fat ainimal has been fed at a loss diu
ling the latter part of its feediig.
When an animal is ready for market,
sell it ; if there is feed left, y sonmeic
more lean animals and feed them.
"The nimuble sixpenco" brings the
profit.
Young Fall Pigs should have plen
ty of millk, and if the food is made
"nilk-warnm," they will thrive the
better for it. Small potatoes, boiled
and mnashed in skimmed milk, with a
little bran, will make trhern grow
rapidly. Feed a little at a time and
often. The young pig's stomach is
very small, and overfeeding causes
indigestion, arnd prevents growth.
Stables and Pens should lie made
tight for the winter. D)ry, tight
floors, warm bedding, close doors and
windows, and ventilation from the
ceiling or over doors, are necessary
to the comfort of animals.
Pure water is a first requisite for
man or beast. A good well, or cis
tern, provided with aUniversal Force
Pump, will be found one of the most
profitable thinugs in the barn-yard or
eouse-yard.
Poultry - Cull out undesirable
fowls, and keep only good ones. Pure
bred fowls are as profitable, in their
way, as other pure bred stock. Feed
young pallets with boiled potatoes,
nmashed in the water they irave been
cooked in, and mixed, while hot,
witn corn meal and cracked wheat.
Feed thit warm, and every week give
some of the "Imperial Egg Food,"
with some of Bowker & Co's. meat
and bone flour along with the food.
This Sll give eggs all through tile
winter. The culled fowls may be
cooped and fed on scalded skimmed
milk, with corn and oatmeal, for
three weeks, when they will be as fat
as thie can be made; to feed any long- B
er is a waste of time and food. This
food makes sweet and white flesh aid
fat. Whlen fed for market, give only
corn, which makes thie yellow fait so
desiid by the poultry dealers.
Sitadry Mattera -Dry earth is tihe
clealeat and most healtlhful litter for
the ibultuy-hoise or pig pen. Where
sand is plentiful, this is also clean and
wholesome litter. Fine road dust is,
perhapi, the mrost convenient shape
in whichl to collect a quantity of dry
earth for winter use. D)itch scrapings
are also a good litter. Now is a very
good time to procure these materials.
Implements, tools, and machlines may
now hbe cleaned and stored away for
the seison. I)Drains should be looked
to. RHot-houses and cellars should
lie cleatprd and mrade ready for the
potatoes, turnips, etc. Thie half-year
ly whitewalshing should not lie ne
glected Roads rthould be put in or
tier before thie fill rains conime. Paint
waigoins and putty thie seams, before
thie Ilecomrs swollen by they rain. Ev
erything that can be done now to,
prepare for winter will be seasonable
work.
Bermuda Grass.
For tile information of a subscriber
Bt Browns, Ala., whose inquiry was
jiublislhed last week, we copy thie fol
lowing from thie Mobile Register:
"Does Bermuda grass bear seed ?"
'lthis question seenms to be concerning
the people no little just now. Scarce
ly a week passes in which we do not I
rec~fve lttelers asking us to decide it.
More than once we gave our tlecision
through thie Register, but as it seenims
to have escaped the attention of manny
we take this occasion to repeat our
onswer. Of course Bermuda grass
hears seed in some parts of thie worldls
buit not here in thie United States. It
flowers here, and has every appear
ance of seeding, but the seed invari
ably blasts before coining to maturity.
We often see the seed of Bermniuda
lgrass advertised for sale. It is pos
sibly thie seed of some other grass-it
is certainly not thie seed of the true
Bermuda grass (Cynodoan Dacfylon,}
ialess it has been imported from some
other country.
Bermauda grass is now thie greit
tPge in Australia. In that country
rlras call it the Doub grass. Dr. W.
I. bnuilfoyle, in his annual report of
tSrhe aBtmsn. Botanical Garden,
The Doub grais has no superior as
a hardy panstpro grass for arid climes,
though as a.lawn grass it is inferior,
presenting in the winter a brown and
rusty appearance. I can state from
experience, lhosw#ee, in New Southl
Wales and Queensland, that where it
has been introduced round a station
linht, horses and cattle, . when left to
feed as they chose, have collected
