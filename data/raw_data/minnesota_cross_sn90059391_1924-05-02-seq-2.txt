PAGE TWO
DEMOCRATS MAY NAME
DARK NORSE LEADER
Senator Samuel M. Ralston and
John W. Davis Named as
Possibilities
(Bureau of Publication ami KduciUiou)
WASHINGTON. D. C.. April 23. -
If the right man bobs up at the psy-
moment in the coming
Democratic convention in New York
city in June and makes a whirlwind
speech, as William Jennings Bryan
did at Chicago 26 years ago, he stands
a good chance of sweeping the dele
gates off their feet and landing the
presidential nomination of that par
ty, so Washington leaders profess to
believe nowadays.
The country may see that very thing
done this year, as the Democrats are
still navigating a sea of uncertainty
as between the present candidates for
the place. Messrs. McAdoo and Under
wood and Governor Smith of New
York state, the leading candidates,
don’t seem to be making much head
way nowadays. They have gone a
pretty good pace, it is true, but not
fast enough to put them over under
the two-thirds rule. Next in line
comes Senator Samuel M. Ralston of
Indiana and John W. Davis, but nei
ther of these men can get over the
top unless they go faster in the next
30 days than they have been going.
David F. Houston, former cabinet
officer breaks into the limelight ev
ery so often; so does Senator Carter
Glass, of Virginia, also a former cab
inet officer, and there is a little talk
about Senator Royal M. Copeland, of
New York, but it begins to look as
though the Democratic party might
be obliged to turn to some man not
now in the running. It is believed
that he must be a distinct progress
ive from the west or middle west to
offset the old-guard, conservative
Coolidge, of New England, who is
almost sure to be nominated by the
Republicans at Cleveland two weeks
before the Democrats meet.
The proposed third party forces are
not idle. Already two such conven
tions have been called, one to meet in
St. Paul June 17 and the other at
Cleveland on July 4. The country can
almost bank on radical platforms and
radical tickets if the third party de
velops sufficient strength to adopt a
platform and nominate a ticket.
Their hope is to obtain enough votes
to be able to throw the result of the
election into the house and settle
the matter there.
RETURNS TO U. S.
W. G. Calderwood, of the World
Prohibition and Reform Federation,
who has been doing very effective
temperance work in Australasia for
more than thirty months, returned
to the United States on February 18.

Supreme Court
To Hear Case of
Ex-Gov. Walton
(Hurcnu of Publication ami Kit urn I Ion)
WASHINGTON. D. C.. April 28.
One of the bitterest fights in the his
tory of American jurisprudence was
brought into the supreme court of
the United States at Washington re
cently The highest court in this
country reached for argument the
appeal of former Governor John C.
Walton, of Oklahoma, to set aside
his impeachment by the Oklahoma
legislature. The federal district
court for western Oklahoma had re
fused to review the impeachment pro
ceedings.
The proceedings of the supreme
court here were enlivened by the ef
forts of counsel for the former gover
nor to have consideration of the ap
peal postponed. Counsel for the Ok
lahoma house of representatives and
other defendants opposed the move.
The appeal of the former governor
was based upon the ground that he
had not been given a fair and impar
tial trial in the impeachment pro
ceedings. He alleged that the Ku
Klux Klan and other influences pre
dominated the Oklahoma house in
his impeachment and the senate of
that state in his trial.
The lower federal courst refused to
take jurisdiction in the matter on
the ground, broadly, that the ques
tions involved were political and not
judicial.

PITTSBURG. KAN., April 29.—Klan
Krest, the new home of Pittsburg
Klan. was dedicated Monday evening
with appropriate ceremonies. A fea
ture of the event was the naturaliza
tion of a large class of candidates.
A 14-foot -cross, which was lighted
Monday evening for the first time,
will be a permanent fixture, and each
night heareafter the fiery emblem
will keep vigil atop the grandstand,
to proclaim to the world the slogan
of the Ku Klux Klan. “Here yester
day. here today, here forever.”
Klan Krest is a 30-acre tract for
merly used by the Pittsburg Fair as
sociation and includes a building re
modeled for use as a Klavern and robe
room, a large grandstand, race track
and athletic field.
Entering the First Baptist church
here at the close of the Easter morn
ing service, 30 robed Klansmen
formed a cross in front of the pulpit
and sang America with the congrega
tion. After the singing the spokes
man for the Knights presented a flag
to the Rev. Clyde J. Askins, pastor,
to be used in the church.
Leavenworth Klan Unit
Is Increasing Numbers
LEAVENWORTH, KAN., April 28.
- The local unit of the Ku Klux Klan
is growing very rapidly and it is es
timated that the membership will be
doubled in two weeks. Knights are
displaying much enthusiasm. Five
thousand persons were in attendance
at a recent Sunday afternoon lecture
delivered by a national lecturer of
the order. A delegation of 400 Klans
men attended a recent meeting at
Topeka. More than 150 Knights char
tered a special train to take them to
a meeting at St. Joseph. A class of
150 candidates was initiated recently
at Easton, a town near here.
AID CALIFORNIA CHURCH
COLTON, CALIF.—Just as services
of the First Baptist churches were
about to begin, 400 Klansmen, clad in
their full regalia, marched into the
church two abreast, circled the in
terior of the church, and as they
passe dthe pulpit dropped contribu
tions into the collection plates. It
is stated that more than 5500 was
given to the church by the Klansmen.
The church is conducting a campaign
to erect a new building, and the con
tribution of the Klansmen was to

DECLARES ESKIMOS
DO NOT LIKE FATS
Stefan»son, Noted Explorer,
TelU How They Live.
London. Vllhjalraur Stefansson,
writing In the London Spectutor, dis
pels the popular misconception that
Eskimos either eat fat, drink oils or
rub grease upon their bodies. He
points out that the error basically
rests upon a truth, that food Is re
quired not only to repair waste and
enable the doing of physical work, but
also to keep up the body temperature,
which obviously must be the more
difficult the colder the weather. Be
cause the Eskimo lives In a country
considered to be colder than the lands
Inhabited by other branches of the
human race, through deduction and In
duction. persons —without Inquiring
Into the actual facts —have simply
made up their minds on the subject of
fats and oils at concerns this Inter
esting people.
As an actual fact, the noted ex
plorer bolds, the Eskimo consumes
less “food for power’’ than the aver
age Scotsman or Norwegian, for the
obvious reason that the Eskimo* are
really exposed to cold less.
“Some Eskimo winter houses are
cold,” he writes, ‘‘but the typical Es
kimo house resembles more an In
cubator or a Turkish bath than it does
an average European or American
dwelling. Captain Bartlett has said
that the temperature of the Eskimo
houses In northeastern Siberia was at
night around 100 degrees Fahrenheit;
Rasmussen describes the Cape York
Eskimos, the most northerly human
beings in the world, as sitting in mid
winter naked In their overheated
houses with streams of perspiration
running down their bodies, which they
mop continually with towels.
No Need to Drink Oil.
“In such overheated bouaea what
need la there to drink oil or to con
sume a large amount of heat-produc
ing fat to counterbalance radiation
from the body? The proponents of
the oil-drinking theory will suggest
that the people do not live Indoors all
the time and that In winter It may
he extremely cold out of doors. It la
true that, although the lowest winter
temperatures of the Inhabited parts
of Montana or Russia are lower than
any In which the Esklmoe live, still
the average winter temperature of the
Arctic climate Is low. There are dis
tricts where for a month or two In
midwinter you may have an average
of 25 or 30 degrees below sero, and
occasionally even a little lower. But
when the Eskimos go outdoors they
are clad in suits of fur that are prac
tically cold proof. You might about
as well be dressed In a thermos bot

Mr. Stefansaon cannot remember
ever having seen an Eskimo shiver In
winter, but ha has seen them shiver In
summer. The reason for this la that
the Inhabitant of the colder region
of the earth la somewhat controlled
by fashion. In the summer it la cor
rect form, In Eskimo land, to droaa la
the most worn-out and shabbiest rem

As to dressing ths Body.
Aa concerns the grossing of the
body among tbs Eskimos, Mr. Stefane
son has the following to say:
“Our women, used to disappearing
creams, do not see the absurdity of
this: but if you remember that the
only oil available to the Esklmoe Is of
the nature of lard or Ash oil, neither
of which evaporates, you will see the
absurdity at ooce. Ik M wall known

Children Labor Laws
That will “Stick”
Needed Today
(Bureau Publication and Kdueatlon)
WASHINGTON, D. C., April 28.
—Here is something for Klansmen
to think seriously about. Do we
want to work our children or edu
cate them? There are 1,000,000
children employed in working es
tablishments in this country and
one-third of them are under 14
years of age. There are 11 states
in this union that allow children
under 16 years of age to work or
be worked without violating any
law. If this continues, what can
we expect of future generations?
All child labor laws so far enacted
have been declared unconstitution
al. We need legislation on this
subject that will “stick.”

ductors of heat Now, poor heat con
duction (or good non-conduction) de-
pends on air chambers in the clothe*,
whether they are wool or fur. If these
air chamber* were filled with grease,
as they Inevitably would bo If the
body were greased (for the clothes
are In contact with the body), the gar
ments would let the heat of the body
escape somewhat as rubber boots do.
If their clothes were greasy, the Es
kimos would have to spend all winter
In the house; for If they went out
doors they would surely freeze to
death, and quickly."
Concluding, the noted explorer
points out the Interesting fact that
the Esklmoe, like the peoples ef
warmer countries, mature very quick
ly. He says:
“It is commonly said, and doubtless
correctly, that In Europe the people
of the southern countries, such as
81dly, mature early, and the people of
the northern countries, such as Scot
land and Sweden, mature late. From
thla It has been thoughtlemly Inferred
that the Eskimos would mature late.
Doubtlees that would be so If their
bodies were really exposed to the
winter weather. But when you re
member their Turklsh-hath houses and
thermos-bottle clothing, you will toe
that If warmth causes early maturity
then development should bo as rapid
among the Eskimos as among any
tropical people

OLD GUARDS TROUNCED
BY LONG ISLAND G.O.P.
Leader of Insurgent Republicans
Introduced Repealer to
Walker Bill
(Bureau of Publication and Education)
NEW YORK. N. Y., April 28.
The independent wing of the Repub
lican party up in Suffolk county,
Long Island, said to have the backing
of the Ku Klux Klan, put over a sur
prising victory the other day at an
organization meeting of the new Re
publican county committee. All of
its candidates were elected and the
old organization got a great trounc
ing.
George H. McDonald, of Brightwa
ters, newly elected chairman of the
county committee, is reported to be
an organizer for the Ku Klux Klan.
He received 121 votes, while the ma
chine candidate got only 103 votes.
This unexpected setback for the old
crowd so shocked them that they are
still trying to figure out what hap
pened. Assemblyman John Boyle, of
the second district of Suffolk coun
ty, was leader of the insurgent Re
{•ublicans. At the last session of the
egislature he introduced a measure
calling for the repeal of the Walker
bill, which was aimed at the Ku Klux
Klan in New York state.
Babcock Favors Rail Protection
By Restricting Motor Bus Lines
Protection of railroads by the re
striction of motor bus lines to routes
as far as possible along which the
towns and villages do not have ade
quate railway facilities was urged by
C. M. Babcock, state highway commis
sioner, at a recent meeting of the
American Legion in the Noonday caf
eteria, Fifth and Jackson streets, St.
Paul. -
Also Mr. Babcock urged the adop
tion in Minnesota of a gasoline tax,
the proceeds of which would be used
in carrying out a more comprehen
sive paving program and in time
would result in a reduction of the
present motor vehicle tax.
Legislature Has Power
The legislature now has authority
to levy a tax on gasoline, according
to Mr. Babcock. The state constitu
tional amendment to be voted on this
fall is to authorize the legislature to
divert such a tax to the road-build
ing fund.
Those who complain of the motor
vehicle ta* as being too heavy, should
support the amendment, he said, as
the diversion of money from such a
tax to the road fund undoubtedly
would lower the motor vehicle tax —
not at once, but within the ten-year
limit that was set by the highway de
partment for completing Minnesota’s
road-building program.
Mr. Babcock estimated the pro
proposed tax on gasoline would be
one or two cents a gallon. A 1-cent
tax would bring a revenue of about
$2,000,000 a year and a two-cent tax
about double that sum. “Thirty-six
of the forty-eight states in the Unit
ed States have such a tax,” he said,
“ten of the remaining twelve will
have it by the end of this year, and
if Minnesota and Illinois pass it, they
will complete the list."
At present the only money avail
able to the state for road building is
derived from a 1-mill general tax
and the motor vehicle tax. Accord
ing to Mr. Babcock the gasoline tax
is absolutely necessary. He added
