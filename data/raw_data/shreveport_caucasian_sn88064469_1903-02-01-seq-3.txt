FINANCIAL MEASURE.
The ('onsidleration of the Sulject Is
Expected to Bring Up Payment
of Chinese Indemnity in
the White Metal.
Washington, Jan. 30.-President
Roosevelt sent the following message
to congress:
"I transmit herewith a report from
the secretary of state with accompany
ing notes from the Mexican ambassa
dor and the Chinese charge d'affairs ad
interim, which ask co-operation of the
United States in such measures as will
tend to restore and maintain a fixed
relationship between the moneys of the
gold standard countries and the silver
using countries. I recommend that the
executive be given sufficient powers to
lend the support of the United States in
such manner and to such degree as he
may deem expedient to the purposes of
the two governments.
"THEODORE ROOSEVELT."
The message was referred to the com.
mittee on finance.
In his communication, Secretary
Hays says:
"It is not asked that the United
States modify its monetary system and
it is distinctly disavowed' that any
movehnent is contemplated fod the re
storattoW of International-bi-uretatism.
The opinion is expressed by the rep
resentatives of both governments that
consultation between the United States
and the European powers having de
pendencies in the Orint and the in
dependent countries where silver mon
ey is in general use, may result in the
adoption of a monetary system which
will prevent the great fluctuations in
exchange which now occur in trade
with the silver-using countries. It such
a result can be achieved, and it is point
ed out that at least a partial solution
has been proposed in the United States
in a bill now pending in the senate in
regard to the Philippine islands, great
beneits will follow to the trade of the
world by making easier the access of
the products of manufacturing nations
to the markets of China and the other
silver-using countries.
"The consideration of this subject
may have an important bearing also
on the payment of the indemnity due
by China to certain European powers
and to the United States by enabling
the Chinese empire to put her monetary
system upon a `ila Which Will make
- possible for her to meet these pay,
=uents in a manner satisfactory to all
the powers. This result, if it could be
aecomplished, would be of the first im
portance, not only,to the United States
and to the other powers having a share
in the indemnity payments, but to
China herself and her future' develop
ment."
NEARLY A BREACH.
There Is a Deddd Paule. is the Vene

Washington, Ja. 30.--'There was a
pause in the Venezuela negotiations
that appr d perilously near a
h.esc: an $ thend mId is notr yet- in
sithy it all rsvow ot of -the atti.
tiode. toAe AIlles tin insastti upon
preferential fratment for themselves
in the settlement of their claims. As
foreshadowed in the London dispatch.
es, Mr. Bowen has been informed of
the `decision of the al!ies to insist in,
his work for the moient. Possibly
fresh and enlarged powers will bel
-ncessary to enable him to meet tle
demands of the allies.
Two courses are open now to Mr.
Bowen, and it probably will be for
President, Castro to elect which he'
shall follow. He may in his response
to the other claimant, nations, than
the allies, take the opportunity to in
form the world that Venezuela yields
to overypwering force-sad that if she
cannot meet their claims they squat
reckon with the allies themselves.'
The other course is for himn to dg
lare that his mission has failed, that
he cannot come to a reasonable a L
derstanding with the' allies becamse
of their uncompromising attitude and
therefore the case must go to. the
Hague ttibunal for adjustment: .

Washington Jan. 30.--The Venezue
lan astuation, especially the attitude of
Germany, was discussed by the senate
eommittee OQ military affairs, and the
tituation influenced the committee on
scene matters pertaining to the army
-Appropriation bill, among which was
the decision to accept the house pro
vision trelating to transports; that they
be srtained in the service.
The discussion was general and ea
neat, and the conclasion reiached, as
stated by a member of the committee,
was that the United Sta:tes make- t
plain thateth Bonosr and dignity of the
country would be maintained and that
Germ.any pshould not be, alloWed to

STOOD UP FOR QUAY.
Senator Foraker Said He Hlad a RIight tc
P'irsue Course Taken.
Washington, Jan. 30.-The senate
proceedings Thursday were unmarked
by any lively debates such as occurred
Wednesday. When the Rawlins resolu.
tion calling on the secretary of war fo:
the evidence in certain courts martial
cases in the Philippines was laid befor;,
the senate. Mr. McLaurin of Missis
s!ppi urged its adoption.
He detailed certain acts of cruelty
on the part of the American soldiers
toward Filipino men and wom:nn, and
said the senate should have the evi
dence in such cases.
He remarked that it was easy to
sty there was a syndicate of slander
and defamation inathe senate towarl
the army, but when the army was slan
dered, the American officers were slan
dered by showing them to have been
guilty of outrages, and he argued that
they should be weeded out of the ser
vice.
The statehood bill was then taken up,
but Mr. Quay yielded to permit Mr.,
Proctor to report the army appropria
tion bill, which he said he would call
up at the earliest possible moment.
A message from the president was
read in wh.ch he asked for the neces
sary power to co-operate with Mexico
and China regarding the restoration of
the parity of silver and gold. It was
referred to the committee on finance.
Mr. Lodge then concluded his re-I
marks in opposition to the omnibu.
statehood bill, and Mr. Bard of Cali
fornia also spoke In opposition to it.
At the conclusion of Mr. Bard's re
marks and just before the senate ad
journed Mr. Foraker, having the state
hood bill in charge in the temporary
absence of Mr. Quay, said ýrotn state
ments he had received the action of
Mr. Quay Wednesday in introducing
the statehood bill as proposed amend -
-- ints-toe the agricutural an4d sunry-y
civil bills was regarded as an unheard
of proceeding. It was not unheard of
at all, he said. It was simply a ques.
tlon whether a majority of the sen
ate could do a thing it wanted to.
