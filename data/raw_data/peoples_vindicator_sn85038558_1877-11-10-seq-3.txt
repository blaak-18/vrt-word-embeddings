The distinguishing features of the
new tariff bill introdu'ed by the
lion. B. H. Willis, of New York, in
the House of Representatives, are a
reduction of 25 per cent of the duties
upon all imported articles, excepting
raw materials which enter into man
ufactories; these are reduced over
100 per cent ad valorem. Duty has
been restored on Tea and Coffee.
The proper tariff law, and one which
time has shown thi wisdom of in
England, is to tax only the luxuries,
Wines, Spirits, Silks and Tobacco,
letting all other articles go upon the
free list.
The people will make a powerful

GADDIS -On Saturday night of the
13th October, 1877, in the seventeenth
year of her age, ELL.t Asny, wife of
T'homas C. Gaddis, of Sabine parish,
Louisiana.
In the death of Mrs. Ella Gaddis, again
we are reminded and have another
striking instance that the young must
die as well as the old.
"Leaves have their times to fall,
The flower to wither at the North winds
breath,
But all, thou hast all,
Seasons for thine own, oh I death."
Only one year ago Ella Ashy was the
light of her fathers house, the gay aid
frolicsome girl of her neighborhood, full
of hope and health (by nature) painted
on her cheek. Only a few short months
ago she was made the happy wife of
Thomas C. Gaddie. Well do we rememn
ber when on leaving our !.ouse, the morn
ing of the wedding night, we received
the cordial and hearty grasp of his hand,
and giving our blessing and best wirhats,
he sped his iway to his fair betrothed.
The festal board was spread. and rela
tives and friends were there to witness
the nuptial ceremonies, nul wish joy,
happiness, and prosperity to the young
couple. Ah! little thought they that so
soon death would visit the bridal cham
ber, that in so short a time they would
again look upon their fair young friend,
cold and stiff in death, clothed in the
same pure white dress and the same
bridal wreath and veil encircling her
pure white brow, but though she has
gone, and to her bereaved husband and
friends she has bid farewell, to them
we would say-remember
She is but a flower, plucked from earth,
Transplanted, to bloom in the skies.
