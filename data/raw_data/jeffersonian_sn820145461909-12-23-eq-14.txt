I would thank the gentleman from
Thomasville to please give me his name,
as I think his post-card requires an an

Surely he is not ashamed of his com
posures. With no ill feeling I would
like to reply to his address myself.

WHAT IS PAID FOR NEGRO
EDUCATION.
In a letter recently written by
State School Commissioner Jere M.
Pound to a Northern publication at
tention is directed to the money ap
plied for negro education in Georgia.
It is shown in this letter that Geor
gia is giving four times as much for
negro education as it receives from
the negroes for educational purposes.
Figures are presented to show that
the total receipts from all sources
for public education in 1908 amount
ed to $3,786,830.70. It may be
stated that two-thirds of this amount
goes to pay the salaries of teachers.
White teachers in white schools re
ceived $2,289,258.12. Negro teach
ers in negro schools received $47,-
269.39.
The values of property owned by
negroes in 1908 returned for tax
ation in Georgia was $27,042,672. If
every dollar of this property paid
taxes at the rate of five mills it would
mean that the State received from
this source $135,213.36 for all State
purposes—educational and every
thing else. The receipts from poll
taxes paid by negroes amounted to
$75,000 in 1908, making a total of
$12,676 for education. The actual
piopoition of taxes paid by negroeu
for educational purposes under the
State apportionment which sets aside
a tax of 1.8 mills for education, was
$48,676.
In other words, four times as
much was paid out in Georgia for
negro education as was received from
negro taxpayers for that purpose.
But the money appropriated out of
the State Treasury for negro educa
tion is not all that is spent for this
purpose in Georgia. Nearly all the
leading churches support negro edu
cational institutions, as for instance
the Payne Institute of Augusta
which is supported by the Methodist
church. And then there are the va
rious negro colleges, supported by
endowments or by Northern philan
thropic institutions. These together
will largely swell the amount that is
spent annually for the education of
the negroes in this State, and makes
it largely exceed the sum total paid
by the negroes in direct State taxes.
Much of this money is worse than
wasted. One need not go as far as
Senator Ben Tillman, who is op
posed to all negro education, to
come to this conclusion. In this day
and time there should be none un
able to read and write, and negro
children as well as white children
should be given a primary education
and taught the three R’s. In so far
as the money that is spent for negro
education is applied to this purpose
there can be no valid objection to it.
But the money spent above this,
teaching the higher branches and all
the various ologies, is worse than
wasted. It unfits the negroes for the
mly work that is now or ever will
be open to them generally. The lim
ited number of negroes required
with more than a rudimentary edu
cation should acquire this by their
own efforts, which would make it the
more valuable to them, as it would
school them in self-reliance.
LOCAL FARMERS’ UNIONS!
Don’t you think that Duckworth
owes it to the Union to answer those
questions? POP IT TO HIM IN
YOUR RESOLUTIONS.
A negro who has a smattering O s
Latin will never make a good plow
hand. Higher education unfits the
negro for useful work that is open to
him, and this combination of a little
learning and idleness leads only too
many of them into crime. It would
be better for the country and better
for the negroes if no more money be
spent for their education than what
was required to teach them the
three R.’s. —Augusta Herald.
