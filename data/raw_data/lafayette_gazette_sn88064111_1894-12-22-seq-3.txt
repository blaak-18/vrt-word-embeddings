mission by the Methodist conference
held in New Orleans a few days
ago, on the ground that he is in the

'the conference that Mr. Montgom

incident from the pulpit: While

occasion, a herd of 90oo steers
stampeded and in trying to escape
from their path he rode to the brink

A primary election was held in
the second ward to select a member Ha
of the Police Jury to replace Mr.
Ford Hoffpauir whose resignation
from that body was necessitated by
continued illness. The vote cast
was as follows: Jos. W. Broussard
78, Ben Avant 62, and W. M. Har- es
son 23. Mr. Broussard is a very
worthy gentleman and will prove a
useful member of the Police Jury.
What a pity that Charles A. Dana
of the Sun, Joseph Pulitzer of the

Lafayette to get some pointers
about running their newspapers.

in its limits a few "Knowalls" who
could tell these distinguished editors
more about the newspaper busi
ness in ten minutes than the late
Horace Greeley could have told -
them in a month. And the of
wonder is: why don't these la,
intellectual giants go where they in

A Pretty WVedding. at
One of the prettiest weddings ri
ever witnessed in Lafayette was the w
o ne last Tuesday which united Mr. pi
IJoseph Ducote and Miss Caroline Bl
Martin in tha sacred bonds of mar- w
riage. Nuptial ceremonies always p,
attract large corwds of people in F
Lafayette and this occasion was it
no exception to the rule. I.ong be- Ic
fI ore the appointed hour a large nun,- \
ber of people assembled in front of b
the Catholic church and waited for ti
the arrival of the bridal party, who Ic
camue at the time fixed and walked V
to the altar in the following order: f:
SMiss Louise Revillon, the brides- 
maid, prettily attired in a beautiful it
costume of pink silk, and the r.
gt roomsman, Mr. Robt. A. Bailey; g
next came the bride, becomingly u
e gowned in brocaded satin, leaning!
e on the arm of her brother, Mr. J. t,
Ia E. Martin. She was the ideal bride a
in her elegant dress, which was a
1
splendid specimen of the dreismak
er's art. Then followed the bride- e
groom accompanied by his aunt,
Mrs. Jules Revillon. The impress
ive ceremony of the church was
,, performed by the Rev. Father Mal
trait who made a brief sermon and
- spoke very feelingly. After the
r- the reverend gentleman had con- K
re cluded the ceremony and pro
- nounced the happy couple busband
is and wife, a few friends and mem- I
n bers of the two families repaired to
d the future home of MIr. and Mrs.

A Relic of LaFitte.
Dr. H. E. Martin, of Acadia par- D
ish, came to Lafayette this week
and brought with him a very cu
rious old pistol, which, no doubt, p
was once the property of the famous in
pirate, LaFitte. It was found near Is
lBayou Ncpiquet by some people
while searching for treasures sup
posed to have been buried by La- A
Fitte. It is exactly fifteen inches
in length with the cannon in a yel
low metal resembling copper.
What bears out our statement that it IF
E belonged to the great pirate is A
the name '-IAFIT FE" in capital
letters engraved on the handle. A
1 While the letters are somewhat ef
faced, they are easily discernible
- with a glass, but with the naked eye
1 it is impossible to see them. This odd
relic is now in the possession of a -
gentleman in Lafayette where it
will remain for some days after
which, it is intended to forward it L
to the I.ouisiana Historical Society I
c at New Orleans.
a Dr. Rus:;ell Caffery.
In Christ church last W\ednesday I
evening Miss Edith Cush-an,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. B. C.
- Cushinan, was married to Dr. Rus
sel Caffery, Rev. H. D. Aves, rec
tor of the church, officiating. The
church was well filled with friends
cl and relatives, the "Daughters of
e the Church," of which the bride
- was one, were well represented.
To the familiar strains of Mendels
d sohn's wedding march the bridal
party entered the front door and
- proceeded up the aisle to the chan
o eel, as follows: The ushers, Messrs.
Charles Barry, J. H. Daugherty, J.
ir W. MlcCuthon and Charles Calhoun;
best man, Mr. Dan Caffery, brother
of the bridegroom; maid of honor,
d Miss Janie Cushman, sister of the
ie brid 3; Mrs. Cushman, the bride's
mother, with the bridegroom and
Ie the bride with her father, Mr. Cush
man. After the ceremony l)r. and
Y Mrs. Caffery left for New Orleans,
whence, after a short stay, they go
to San Antonia, where they will be
at home after January r at i8
at Avenue D. The bride wore a tray
t. eling costume of tan colored silk,
it trimmed with brown velvet and
ht white pointe lace, with hat and
gloves to match, and Miss Cushman
ly wore a street costume of gray novel
ig ty goods, trimmed with pale blue
ry satin and white lace. The chancel
a was beautifully decorated with
le palms and Southern sinilaxe form
ing pillars of green on each side the
he entrance. From the beak of the
id eagle on the reading desk a heart of
a- pale pink roses was hung by a white
[is satin ribbon. A long rope of ever
Igreens was festooned from the arch
ly above the entrance to the chancel
in and from its center hung a four
is- leaved shamrock.--Houston Post.
