People's Party Candidate

B. W. BAILEY.
OF THE FoulRTII ('(NG.RESSIONAL
J)ISTRI('T (OF LOUTISIANA.
TO THE PUBLIC!
Measrs. W. H. L:ltham and W. H.
Areaux are anuthorited to solicit and1 coni
tract tflr advertiseulent4, job work a:111r
llbscriltiOll, and any ('contracts nmadel, ly
them will le' fully repoglnized aund carriedt
eant ly us. Trritting that the people maly
give usa I libleral supply of their patron
iage we promlise in retulrn to endeavor to
niake all businele ss relatiolsl pleasiant.
READ THIS!
We send ont several smple
copies this week, take them and
read them, and if you think you
can support a paper that is run in
the interest of the people, send us,
your dollar antd we will send you I
the paper for one year, or if you
had rather take it on trial for six
months send us fifty cents. Give
as a trial anyway.
Fixed Very Nicely.
Senator Blanchard of the Unit
ed States Senate, has advised the
sugar planters to sue the United
States for the two cent per pound
bounty on sugar this year, advis
i1g them that they can obtain it
by an action of law. This certainly
# a nice dodge for these statesmen,
and it is a hard matter to tell where
it will end. It seems that matters
have been arranged so all can get
a slice of the pie. First, the su
gar trust will come in for its one
to one and a half cents per plmld,
this the masses of the people will
have to pay. Second, the courts
will give the sugar planters two
cents a pound bonity, this the
same class of people will have to
pay. Third, the payment of the
bounty will evidently, create a de
ficiency in the revenues of thile gov- I
ernment, ald more bonds will have i
to be issued to maintain the gold
reserve, these bonds will bear live I
per cent interest; all this thile lo- I
pie have to pay. (
Now it is evident as to who will 4
do all the paying, let's see who gets t
the money. First, the sugar plant
er. Second, the sugartrust. Thilird,
the gold-bag. This is the nicest I
piece of legerdemain we have seen I
in many a day. Verily, the Demo. I
ersta are great statesmen. Please I
give us another chance, and we will
get all.
The election of (uov. Tillman of ,
outh Cuarolima, is assumed, so says c
a Times-Democrat dispatch. The
Legislature will be overwhelmingly ,
In favor of Tillman for Senator.,
Hurrah for reform ! I

To the Chairman and Members of the
People's Party Convention of the 4th
Congressional District:
We, your committee on resolu- e
tions, beg leave to report as 1oi.I
lows. to-wit: ii
Whereasc, we consider anld be
lieve that the presenlt prevailing m
conditions tlhroughout our land. in n
iý ,vl ic i tlht pl duc e (,it our f Ell, ls
are graluallvy aiil surely shrinkinig
in vallue. ail that Iwagets lt being
reduic.ed to a d:egree that it is iii

a, ake a liviiig by the s% eat oit his
brew. is poduced and Ibroughlt
about by venal legislation through
5 the lh-publican ;Int lIelmocratic
partie's, which lI.gislation is exclu
1 siV'ely i the interest 1of the b)ond
hohl'l• 1tl11 corporations.
\Vh le'ias. we reco'glnize that the
l)iemocratic adlmitiistration has Ghil
; ed to 1)i1'll :a out .lily relief thl-ugh
Iegislat ion or otl hler\ is., but it has
recognized anrid lmai;ntained 'rauds
upo011 the great masses tfl the peo
ile. by deo.etizing, silver: by a
- slhal battle over the tariff bill,
: which was only intedled to lis
lead iand h'eceie the 1people, iln or
`der that a vcaUlpaign issue might be
iiiale Ilt ' futurt e elections.
There'lire, \we delnll e the ])etml
o'iratic ni tio Il adinllistratl inil for
wilfully siirrcnllering the rights of
the mIasses of the people to sugar
trus't, e'imbinit ions and other I)pow
erfuIl imoney powers.
Whereas, we recognize that the
State admlinistrationl has entirely
ifiledto t give tile people such a just,
Iair govclinment Ias the great inter
est of Louisaalll delmanld. That
the admitniistration has itiled to
give the people a fir andl just elec
tion law, by w hieh their votes may
he honestlyv counted and returetd
as cast. but instead, the l)cln rnat
ie party of the State has refused
to endorse such a law.
That the governor has entirely
ignored the voice of the of the people in
making all his alppoilittnents, which
policy is contraryi to all replulic.an
forms oi" government. Therefo'e
we hereby denounIIce the Demnocrat
ic adnministration for refusing to I
give the tpelople an electio: law
Sthat will give the people a free
vote and a ltir co(liunt.
Alhd, wnhereas we l'recognize that
thie People's partly platibrni adopt
e(d at nl,ia., Neheb., i, in 192l, if ear
ri'ed into law, will bring about great
relief to the peoplie, and therefore,
be it resolved, that we hereby I
pledge our entire andthdarty sup
port to the Omaha platforn.
