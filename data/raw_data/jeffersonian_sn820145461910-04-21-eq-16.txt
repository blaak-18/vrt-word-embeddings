Simple Beauty Hints for
Misses
if you want to have pretty hands
when you are a woman grown, don’t
bite your finger nails. Keeping the
nails short in this childish and dis
gusting way spoils the shape and
quality of them, and the unbeautiful
trick causes the finger tips to spatu
late besides.
A little pardonable vanity and ten
cents worth of bitter aloes will cure
the habit. Paint the finger tips with
this so that the bitter taste will re
mind you of the misdeed when you
carry them to your mouth. For the
rest, beautify your hands <a little
every day with careful washing and
some manicuring rites. Once they
begin to improve in looks you will
never go back to the old habit.
Country and town girls often
write me about creams and unguents
for the hands, little knowing that
they have one of the best hand lu
bricators in the world right in their
own kitchens. This is the fat that
comes with the leg of mutton, the
lamb chops, etc. —the grease which,
when tried out, clarified, scented and
chilled in convenient cakes, becomes
mutton tallow. So, if the family
means are limited, don’t spend any
more money for bought creams, but
just make your own mutton tallow
and use it every night after the hand
wash.
Chop the raw fat up finely and
try it out in a double boiler, for if
put directly against tlie fire, it may
burn. Strain it when thoroughly
melted and pour in a bowl of cold
water. When it has formed a solid
cake, melt again, and again go
through the process with the bowl of
water. Do this three times, strain
ing it every time, and after the last
heating put in a small quantity of
rich perfume and pour the grease
directly into little molds to harden.
The scalloped pans used for drop
muffins and cakes are good for this
purpose and a cold cellar is a good
place to keep the extra supply of
hand tallow. But make up only a
small quantity at a time, for the mo
ment it gets rancid its virtues are
lost-
When tooth powder happens to run
out, don't clean your teeth with any
sort of soap that happens to be
around. A little good Castile may
be used three times a week, but very
often this is harmful to enamel and
the comfort of the gums. An occa
sional brushing with salted water, or
water treated to a teaspoonful of bi
carbonate of soda, is cleansing and
antiseptic. Peroxide of hydrogen,
one part to four of water, is a better
whitener and killer of germs.
If you want a good complexion,
don’t sleep or sit long in an unven
tilated room, for foul air induces
very ugly skin troubles and also en
courages colds and malignant fevers.
If there are two windows in the bed
room or sitting room, both should
be open at the top to cause the. draft
that will carry oft' impurities, for if
there is no exit for the bad air it
simply crowds itself in one corner
until it is swept around for rebreath
ing.
But if you happen to have caught
a good crop of pimples for all your
carefulness regarding fresh air, take
a dose of castor oil or some gentler
laxative and then have this simple
ointment made up at the drug store:
Bicarbonate of soda 36 grains
Glycerine 1 drachm
Spermacetti ointment. ... 1 ounce
Rub on the affected parts; let it
remain fifteen minutes and then
wipe off all except a slight film.
Anything which disturbs the cir
culation or nervous system of a
young girl is apt to cause pimples
but absolute cleanliness of the skin,
keeping the bowels free, and drink
ing plenty of fresh water will go a
long way toward curing them. The
beauty doctors also tell you to clean
out the mind —think only pretty
thoughts, in fact, if you want a pret
ty skin.
Borax and glycerine are often ef
ficacious for the mild cases of scaly
eruption which often break out on a
girl's body in the summer when the
heat and clothing have irirtated the
skin. For this trouble, which may
even invade the face and hands, this
little formula gives the right propor
tions of the external curative needed:
Elder flower water 7 ounces
Glycerine 1 ounce
Borax drachm
Apply night and morning and dur
ing the day, if the irritation is ex
cessive.
If you wear tight shoes now, you
will have to wear very loose ones
when you grow up, for a growing
foot cannot be cramped without
throwing the joints out of place, and
this, is time, will result in actual de
formity. Keep the feet in healthy
condition with a daily bath of soap
and water and put on fresh stockings
as often as -possible. Spend some of
the candy money, too, for a cooling
foot powder and dust this over the
feet after every bath and when put
ting on fresh stockings. A little of
the powder shaken in a new pair of
shoes will help them to go on and
off more easily. A weekly soak of
twenty minutes in hot water, treated
to a half cupful of washing soda,
will also rest the feet greatly, and
help to banish the soft corn which
is caused by the wrong shoes, per
spiration, uncleanliness and acid in
the system.
A girl must have well feet to have
pretty feet, and if they are twisted
in any way out of shape, she cannot
have a good walk, which is woman’s
greatest attraction.
As to the walk, it is not correct to
step upon the heels first, but upon
the balls of the foot, with the heel
lifted from the ground. A “flam
footed” walker—she who turns her
toes out too much—should practice
walking pigeon-toed until she cures
herself of her disfiguring habit.
A jump from the feet to the head
may be a big one, but you must re
member always that a girl’s hair is
one of woman’s greatest attractions
in the bud. Pretty hair is primarily
clean hair —hair that shows no mat
ting with dust or stale oil, or that
gives out the sour odor so disagree
able to the fastidious. In order to
keep your hair sweet and clean you
should persuade your mother to buy
one of the bars of greenish castile
soap which are sold at all the good
drug stores for about thirty-nine
cents. This is absolutely pure, and
one bar will last all the family a year
for head washings. It may be used
with or without the beaten-up egg,
which, thinned with a tablespoonful
of warm water, goes on the head
first. The soap must be reduced to
a powder and then boiled to a jelly
and massaged into the scalp after the
egg.
Beef marrow, melted in a double
boiler, strained and scented, makes
a splendid unguent for the scalp and
beautifier for the hair, causing
healthy locks to grow like Jonah’s
gourd in the night.
It is both unhealthy to the scalp
and unclean to use anybody’s comb
except your own, for in this way dan
druff, other scalp disorders and ver
min are carried from head to head.
Combing the hair thoroughly at
night, and going to bed with the
locks neatly braided, preserves the
elasticity of the hair, keeps it from
breaking off, and adds to its luster
and general beauty.—Katherene Mor
ton, in Birmingham Age-Herald.

An Appreciated Letter
Dear Sir: —I heard your debate
with Major Barnes in Jefferson coun
ty, at Hudson’s Ford, when a mere
boy, and I have been an admirer of
you ever since. Why, before your
election very few men knew what
Congress was; afterwards, every
school child knew something. I was
returning from a trip to Baltimore
and Washington city last August by
boat to Savannah and one of my com
panions was a banker, Mr. Wm. Nor
ris, of Stone Mountain, Ga., and as I
told him I was from Warren county,
he said, “Why, you are near Tom
Watson’s county.” He soon inform
ed me he was keeping up with you
(I don’t know whether he is a sub
scriber to your papers or not) and
thought as much of you as I did.
While one time I was entering the
smoking room, this Mr. Norris had
met up with one of your townsmen,
young Mr. Boatwright, and he was
anxious to find out all about you, and
while in a general conversation with
several they soon proposed this ques
tion, Why did you, elected as a Demo
crat, quit the Democratic party? I
am a poor writer and a poor talker,
as you know our family to have been
very silent-tongued people, and es
pecially among strangers, but I
couldn’t help telling the crowd that
the Democratic party left the Demo
cratic principles and that you stuck
to same, was the reason of separa
tion. They had to admit it, and did
admit it. Mr. Norris went by Atlanta
to Savannah, but he came back by
Thomson to see your town, and
wanted me to tell him what part of
town you lived in.
Another time, while in the Na
tional Capitol, everybody strangers,
I met up with a guide who was show
ing a large crowd the building. We
came to the legislative hall. Each
one of the crowd wanted to know
which was their Representative’s
seat; some were from Ohio, some
Massachusetts, and all parts of the
Union nearly, mostly Northern and
Western States, and after all had in
quired I asked the guide if he knew
which was Mr. Watson’s seat when
here. Every one in the crowd turn
ed towards me and seemed to eye
me closely and say to each other,
why he’s from Georgia. So I knew
you were not a such a stranger in
the North as Mr. Ellis would have
you to be, and can say that the
Washington people, whom I had
much conversation with, admired the
Empire State of the South, and as
much on your account as anything
else. You need not doubt you are
opening people’s eyes, both from
your manly stand and from informa
tion given out. May you continue in
your work until ail the people are
informed, and if conditions don’t
change it will be their fault and the
blame will be on themselves, for they
will know “what they do.” The sad
dest thing to me is, that as each year
goes by you are that much nearer
the close of life, but may you be
spared until the whole nation will
know what you are, and that the
whole nation will be as anxious for
your statue in the Capitol as L. Liv
ingston was for Lincoln’s.
The rural mail system is enough
to perpetuate your name.
With best wishes to you and your
undertakings, I beg to remain,
Very respectfully yours,
Gibson, Ga. J. S. HART.
P. S.—One other thing. Why is
it that our county papers do not
copy your writings so that those even
prejudiced against you for something
they can not tell, and won’t take
your paper, can get a chance at your
information? Your “Revised Court
Procedure” ought to be printed in
every county paper, and as for the
Mission question, I think the church
es ought to take up collections to
spread your writings on same over
this country instead of to pay For
eign Missions as now praticed.

Why Not Have a Parcel-Post ?
We know that more than $32,000,-
000 is being expended this year to
provide for country deliveries. The
Postmaster-General says their wag
ons are now carrying an average of
but twenty-five pounds. Each of
these could handle five hundred
pounds, and with a second horse, at
fifty cents a day, twelve hundred
pounds.
The farmers along these country
delivery routes suffer the greatest in
convenience and loss because they
cannot send into town their butter
and eggs and cannot receive back the
merchandise which they are con
stantly needing.—Life.
