because if the methods that general
ly prevail in the North and in for
eign countries were pursued here,
this would soon become an undesira
ble land to live in.
Some of our politicians, newspa
pers and speculators are constantly
harping on the resources of the
South and servilely inviting foreign
capital to invest here and monopo
lizt the advantages which this coun
try offers. Outsiders with surplus
capital (much of it made out of the
South’s CHEAP COTTON), know the
possibilities here and do not require
any urging. There are factories in
the South enough to work up over
1,000,000 bales of cotton. The stock
of only five of these is quoted at less
than par. The balance are worth
from 3 to 100 per cent, above par.
This does not look like a losing busi
ness. But of the capital invested in
these factories 80 per cent, of it is
owned by Northern and English capi
talists. Some of these factories are
in sight of the cotton fields; conse
quently it does not cost them over a
third as much to put up the goods as
it does in New England, Europe or
Japan. It might 15e supposable that
under these circumstances that their
goods could be bought at low prices
here. But these foreign fellows
don’t do business that way. They
will sell their goods to New York
merchants cheaper than they will to
customers right at their doors. Nor
will they pay any more for cotton.
The Coats Thread Company, of
Florida, was the first to make a
raise on the price of spool thread.
As further evidence that foreign
ers like to take a grab at some of
this country, the Mikado of Japan, a
few years ago, bought 10,000 acres of
land in Texas. This is worked by his
own Japanese hireling subjects,—
they never became naturalized —who
smuggled themselves across the line
from Mexico. All the profit of this
goes into the pocket of Japan. In
view of the rapid increase of popu
lation there should be a law pro
hibiting alien ownership of property
in this country.

TELEGRAPH SCHOOL.
There is a great demand just now
for competent telegraph operators.
All the railroads of the country are
calling for them. The Southern
School of Telegraphy, at Newnan,
Ga., offers a good opportunity to re
liable, ambitious boys to qualify for
service. A four or six months’
course will enable the student to
graduate, and the school guarantees
him a position. Write for their new
illustrated catalogue.

THE ISSUE
EX-GOVERNOR JAMES K. VARDAMAN'S
PAPER FOR THE SOUTH
Published Every Saturday Morning at Jackson. Mississippi.
Vardaman was abused at first: he was called an agitator, an
alarmist, a firebrand: but at last the sober second thought of
the people began to waken and they began to listen. Today
what he has to say on the race problem, is the word of the su
preme authority. Combining all the knowledge of writers on
this question, from dawn of history to the present time, ap
plied and measured by personal observation and first - hand
knowledge, Governor Vardaman has a message to deliver of
huge import to the American people today.
