While the fight on the rules has

1. It provided a means of

2. Ends the pocket vote of un

ANTI-KLAN BILL IN CONGRESS
—K-K-K
Representative George W. Lindsay
of Brooklyn, N. Y., though nominally
a Protestant, has introduced in Con
gress a bill designed to kill the Ku
Klux Klan. Coming from the po
litfttel atmosphere of Tamany Hall,
he shares the spirit of Roman Catho
lic bigotry that has brought many
measures into Congress and other
legislative bodies in recent years to
make Protestantism a criminal of
fense as Papal Rome has uniformly
done when clothed with sufficient po
litical power.
Like the Mer Rouge fiasco, the
Walton outlawry in Oklahoma and
the rioting and murders that Papal
minions have perpetrated to break up
Protestant meetings and parades in
recent months, the Lindsay measure
in Congress will simply add a few
millions of members to the native
born Protestant organization whose
growth has been so marvelous under
such persecution. Omitting the pure
ly formal parts, the following is the
text of the Lindsay bill:
“Section 1. The term religion, as
used in this act, shall mean any be
lief or profession of faith in a Su
preme Being or Divinity, regardless
of forms of worship, declarations of
faith, creed or custom.
“Section 2. If any corporation, as
sociation, union, organization, group,
or aggregation of individuals by any
overt act, demonstration of force,
threat of personal bodily injury, or
physical force against person or prop
erty or possessions, or by intimi
dations, real or attempted, or through
donning weird, unusual or uncanny
habiliments, including coverings of
head or face, shall attemot to bring
into disrepute, infringe, embarrass,
hamper, oi interfere with any re
ligion or religious belief, or the prac
tice thereof, or the civil, social or
personal rights of any individual
member or believer of any religious
denomination, because thereof, or
shall publish, or cause to be published
in a newspaper or magazine devoted
exclusively to that purpose, any
threatening, harmful, insidious or in
citing statements of a comprehen
sive and general nature, against any
religion, oi the profession and prac
tice thereof, without including spe
cific names, dates and places, where
by an individual offended might have
recourse tc protection or redress un
der state libel laws, such organiza
tion shall be held to be unlawful, and
it shall be unlawful for any state
to issue a charter or articles of incor
poration, or other legal recognition to
such organization.
“Section 3. And any individual
participating in the manner hereinbe
fore mentioned shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor, and if found guilty,
shall be sentenced to not more than
one year in a federal prison, or
SI,OOO fine, or both.
“Section 4. This act shall be cited
as the ‘Anti-Intolerance Act.’
“Enforcement of this act shall de
volve upon the United States District
Attorney.”
Such is the spirit of political Ro
manism in this country. How it
would devour Protestantism if it had
the power! How it does itch to sup
press every Protestant periodical!
How it covets the legal right to send
to prison every Protestant minister
tha speaks from his pulpit on the
Reformation or even announces his
intention to do so! How wickedly
deceptive is all its propaganda about
brotherly love and toleration!

NO OFFICIAL KLAN JEWELRY'
More and more are advertisements

Dr. H. W. Evans, Imperial Wizard,
which reads as follows:
“All insignuia of any kind is. copy

why the House should wait for the

The CALL QFTHE NORTH
AMERICAN WOMEN MENACED BY REAL "YELLOW
PERIL” IN U. S. CITIES
The necessity for the stand taken
by the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
in maintaining white supremacy and
the possibilities of real service in ex
posing the menace of a new, but very
real “Yellow Peril” in the country’s
metropolitan centers is revealed in
an article by Robert T. Small, of New
York, appearing recently in the Chi
cago Daily News.
While this article depicts conditions
in New York City investigation shows
that it might apply equally well in
Chicago, San Francisco or a dozen
other American cities.
The article reads:
“A new yellow peril has laid the icy
grip of death on the metropolitan dis
trict of New York. Within a year
nearly a score of white girls have
paid with their live* for the folly of
association with slant-eyed men,
about whose ways they knew nothing.
“The police of the city have done
their best to break up the places
where the white girls meet the yellow
men—a sinister assortment of the
lower types of Chinese, Japanese and
Filipinos. But as fast as they raid
one joint another seems to spring up
in its place, and despite all the warn
ings called out to them the supply of
girls willing to drop into the yellow
underworld seems all but inexhausti
ble.
“The orientals and white girls
meet at so-called dancing ‘saloons’
where no white man is allowed to en
ter. Detectives and blue-coats have
had to batter their way into many of
these places. One of them was in a
fashionable section of Riverside
Drive. Others have been as far
scattered as the outskirts of Flat
bush. But always the atmosphere is
the same—barred doors, burning in
cense, colored musicians, whiskey,
cigarettes and girls with the drowsy
eyes that tell of something more in
sidious than tobacco.
White Girls Caught In Raids
“There is scarcely ever a raid in
Chinatown but that some white wo
man is dragged out of the shadows
that lurk in this still mysterious sec
tion of the city. This week the nar
cotic squad ferreted out an old-time
opium den down in Bayard Street.
Even the police had thought this sort
of vice a thing of the past. Chum

Chinaman arrested on the charge of
possessing opium. With him was

Senator Replies to Charges of Oppo
nant Who is Contesting His Seat
in Upper House.
(Bureau Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C.— The answ
er of Senator Mayfield to his oppon
ent was filed Wednesday morning
with the subcommittee on privileges
and election. In general terms it first
outlined the primary election; his en
trance into the primary election; his
actions in regard to it, and
provisions of law on the subject; the
result of the two primary elections,
the nomination of the Republican can
didate, his withdrawal, and the se
lection of the contestant as the Re
publican candidate, and the laws of
Texas in the matter, and the litiga
tion in Texas which resulted, as
well as thp litigation which was start
ed to prohibit the certification of con
testee as the regular Democratic
nominee. •
Second, the answer outlines the
general situation in regard to the
vote in the' several counties of Texas,
and the general form of the ballots
that were issued to voters.
Third, it describes the general
character of the election and the con
duct of contestee therein.
Fourth, it discusses the personal
expenses of the contestee. Specifical
ly after this introductory matter, it
denies the allegations of the petition
of the contestant; first, with regard
to the election of contestete; second,
with regard to his expenses; third,
with regard to any alleged illegal con
duct in the election, or any illega
lity in the conduct of the election
which deprived contestant of having
his name upon the ballots; fourth,
the allegations with regard to intimi
dation; fifth, the allegations) of any
illegality through which contestee’s
name was placed on the ballot.
Sixth, the allegations of illegal or
fraudulent votes.
Seventh, the allegations with re
gard to any miscount of votes.
Eighth, the allegations concerning
intimidation or unlawful contribu
tion or false returns.
It ends with the prayer that the
contest of the contestant be disal
owed and dismissed.
All Texas Men Deputies
It has been agreed that the forty
deputy sergeauts-at-arms to gather
up the ballots, ballot boxes, tally
sheets, etc., shall be Texas men.
They will not be sworn in here but
all will take the oath of their office
in Texas and it will be administered
to them by some one there in author
ity to act.
The subcommittee has made appli-
27, who said she was the wife of the
oriental.
“On top of this raid came the slay
ing of a white girl, 17 years of age,
in Elizabeth, N. J., by Felix Salazar,
a Filipino. The girl and the Filipino
had worked in the same factory and
had been ‘keeping company’ to a cer
tain extent. The Filipino lay in wait
for the girl outside her home, and as
she stepped out, fired six bullets into
her from an automitic pistol. To the
police at first he would say nothing.
Later he confessed that he had want
ed to marry little Ellen Alber, but she
would not agree to it and had told
him to keep away.
Nurse Slain By Filipino
“A white nurse was slain recently
by a Filipino who carefully stuffed the
body into a bulging suitcase, carried
it to the Staten Island ferry and
threw it overboard. He was captur
ed and tried and is now awaiting ex
ecution at Sing Sing.
“One of the most pathetic of all
these cases, however, still is unsolv
ed, although it occurred in the Christ
mas holidays. A beautiful young Irish
girl had taken employment in one of
the thousands of Chinese restaurants
about the city. All the waiters, the
floor managers and the cooks paid de
voted attention to her, but she told
them one and all that she was not
‘going Chinese.’ For a year she re
sisted temptation. Then one of the
cooks, by a dog-like adoration, soft
ened her heart and she consented to
marry him if he would take her to
live on the upper west side and not
to Chinatown or any of its environs.
“The couple took a four-room
apartment and the Chinaman spent
all his savings in fitting it up for his
white wife. He would not let her
work any longer. The two apparent
ly were very happy, but, with the
savings gone, the cook found his ex
penses were running far above his
pay at the restaurant. It occurred
to him to take in a romer -or two.
One was a Chinese sailor. At Christ
mas time the girl was found' dead in
the bath tub, her throat cut from ear
to ear and the silken cord of a ki
mono tied deep in the wound.
“The Chinese sailor disappeared.
The police books are filled with these
mixed-color crimes and they are
among the most difficult problems
with which the authorities have to
deal.”

McAdoo Realizes He Must Make His
Stand Before All the People.
Backed by Baruch and Walsh—
Both Bitter Enemies of the Klan
—K-K-K
What’ll McAdoo do—on the Klan
issue?
Protestant America and political
Washington each await an answer to
that question.
The party chiefly concerned, who
admittedly has presidential aspira
tions, himself is in a quandary.
While it is generally known that
McAdoo is an avowed enemy of the
Klan, he does not seem to relish the
idea of coming out publicly and say
ing so.
And not without reason. “Papa”
Wilson’s son-in-law is nobody’s fool
—especially in things political.
Hot Water
He realizes that some five to ten
millions of native-born white Protest
ant Americans, their wives, mothers,
sons, daughters and friends, are
going to do. no little bit at the polls
in 1924 when the casting of ballots
takes place.
That means that the presidential
nominee who goes on record against
the things for which he stands is
going to have somewhat of an ob
stacle to overcome before he may
hope to take up a four-year resi
dence in the White House.
McAdoo realizes that and, without
doubt, would like to sidestep the
issue, were it possible. But he can
not and for three good reasons. They
are:
Barney B. Behind
1. He has been all but officially
approved by the Catholic Welfare
Council as its favored son. The
council, on July 6, went so far as to
send out from its Los Angeles of
fice a statement of McAdoo’s given
out on the subject of citizenship.
This was construed as informal ap
proval of McAdoo as the organiza
tion’s choice of candidates for the
presidency.
2. McAdoo’s chief supporter and
financial backer is Bernard B. Bar
uch, a Jewish banker of New York.
It hardly seems consistent that the
well knowm Barney would support
and finance any candidate who would
take a stand favorable to the Ku Klux
Klan.
3. Senator Thomas J. Walsh, of
Montana, bitter enemy of the Klan
organization and a Catholic, is Mc-
Adoo’s principal supporter in Wash
ington.
So it is to be expected shortly that
McAdoo will break into print with
resolutions denouncing the Invisible
Empire. They may be veiled (no
name mentioned), but the idea will be
there.
What will follow?
Hands Tied
When McAdoo goes on record
against the Klan his goose is cook
ed, as far as getting substantial sup
port from the solid South is concern
ed. Southerners are not backward
in letting it be generally known that
they have no desire for Rome to dic
tate the politics of the United States.
In other words, if the issue dwind
les down to Rome and Republicanism
—then the South will choose the
latter, say those who know Southern
politics.
It is a well known fact that Mc-
Adoo is on the fence. If he falls for
the dead issue—the League o’ Na
tions—he’s in bad company, and if he
endorses Baruch and Walsh he will
lose the Klan’s support.—The Klans
man (Dayton).
