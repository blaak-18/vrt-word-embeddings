Louder.
We once heard this cry nlade to
one of our distinguished members of
Congress, while lie was makiing a
public speech to a large crowd in a I
spacious hall, in the city of New Or
leans. It, in no way disconcerted
him, for his reply was: "'le patient
gentlemen, and I will get loud enough
for you all before I am through ;" i
and so he did, making his voice per
meate every and all parts of the build
ing, and distiitly audible to every 1
one present. Warming with his sub
ject, and being very eloquent, lle
gradually approached the Louisiana
question, her wrongs, the indignities
she lhas been compelled to bear, with
the despised usurper as her Govel nor.
There were no longer any cries of
"''louder" froim the audience, but they
all calmed down into attentive si
lence, and not a murmur could be
heard throughout that vast assembly.
Although we do not desire to coim
pare ourselves to a distinguished
mlember of Congless, but we will say
this: that before this camplaign is
over, we will get our paper "h''lt"
enough to suit the miost fiery and im
lletuous. There is one thing we do
not prlopose to do, lhowever, and that
is to lose our anolnunition firing at
long range. It would be the greatest
tilly and imbecility to introduce the
snlubject matter of the canmpaign at the
initiatory prelude, and give the ene
mny the chance to attempt to "put
their house in older," to escape the
heavy blows they may reasonably
expect. The game has not yet "bro
ken cover," and until it does, do not
cry out "hotter," but rather' he con
tented, and rest in patience, well as
sured, that the work will be done at
the pliiper time, and in the proper
nlanner, provided, we do not othinid
the instincts of modesty, and disre
gard all claims of propliety, in order
to suit the taste of those who may de.
site the detailing of private scandal.
We are now making up the record,
and reconnoitring the ground before
us, and will be able, no doubt, in due
course of time, to serve up things as
"hot" as any one may wish. There
, is no scarcity of material to make
things "hot," but, then, when we do
get in that pungent condition, we
want to scorch 'em to a parpose.
Hon. John B. Gordon.
In a speech in the Senate of the
I United States on March 9th, 1876,
Sshowed how rmuch the Government
has been defrauded in the collection
of the Revenlue Tax on whisky, for
the last thirteen years. The sum, ac
cording to his figures, is fabulous;
amounting in round ilnubers to the
Senormous amnount of eight hundred
Smillions of dollars; enough to pay
tile expenses of an hundred Centen
nials, or build a Pacific railroad, not
r only to California, but almost around
a the world, if there was land to sus
fl ain it.
After shlowing the radical defects
of the Revenue system, and asking
the Senate to take somle steps to pre
v rent so much frand and partizan se
lection of officers, lie thus coneludes:
I think it is Buckle who says that
there are eras of crimie and of differ
ent grades of cliume. Whether Buckle
says so or not, it is true. There are
erns of crime, and this unfortunately
is one of themn. What will hle who
shall chronicle these events in tile
fiuture call this era in our history f
What can lie call it but an era of pub
, lic shame, of public theft, of public
I prostitution ? It is timnle to begin a
reform, and no better place to begin
it than in this revenue service. Tlhe
Sgreat evil, the towering, the over
shadowing evil of thlis day is the love
of money and the love of display
which mioney penrmits, and tie telnl
tation of ,fficials to obtain money
[ through official corruption. This is
-. the great fact that stands out boldly
before us. Hlow shall we exaggerate,
then, the importance of throwing
e arolund tile collectors of our revenue
all tile conditions and before them all
tile incentives to honesty which shall
a enable them to resist temptations so
peculiar to their situation I
Can we not do this? Can we not
r bury party considerations for suchl a
Sresult? Can we not foriget for a time
I that we are parties with a great po
litical contest before us, and remluem
a her only that we are Americans, withl
e a republic to save, a reputation to
k redeem? If we cannot, if with this
Srecord of official crime before us, if
with this demton of demoralization
Senthroned in the very seat of the
d Government, with this gathering flood
d of corruption rolling over great and
once honored departments of Govern
ment, and breaking at last at tile
very steps of the Executive Mansion,
i if with tihe very foundations of po
. litical and of offlicial morality crumb
,ling beneath us we cannot forget tihe
feuds of thIe past in the effort to save
0 from thle frauds of the present, then
we shall surpass the miadness of Jern
e salem breaking into factions while
r Titus thundered at her gates.
Mr. President, this is a good year
to begin reformation, and this is a
good place to originate it. Let us
not only unite here without distinc
tion of party to rescue this Revenue
Depart.enta, but let us unite tile peo
ple of all parties and of all sections
I inl thile eftfort .to restore honest and
. Iure government, and practical, sub
stantial, universal reform.
SWe continue to send our paper to
Sall of our friends, and, as only one
. has been returned, we conclude that
r they want it, and will become sub
seribers; therefore, we ask them to
send in tile amnount of the absecrip
Stion, which is only *2.00. In this
B conneetion will state that we cannot

Easter Sunday.
As many have expressed surprise
that this feast should occur on the t
16th, and not on the 9th of the pres- s
cut month, we have concluded to t
give some explanation of the matter,
which may not be without interest to t
a manjority of our readers. Easter is F
one of those moveable feasts, regu:la- '
ted by the changes of the nloon, and t
consequently must be as variable as c
the moon itself, with this exception, f
however, it must always be on a Sun
day, and this Sunday Imust be the
first, after the first full moon after t
the Vernal Equinox.
Now for tlihe explination, how, this
year it happens on the I6th, and not
on the 9th inst., as the full moon was I
on Saturday, the 8th, at forty-eight
minutes past seven o'clock in the af
ternoon, and according to customi,
Easter should, thlerefore, have been I
on the 9th, the first Sunday after tile
first full moon of the Vernal Equinox.
The Iproper time for the celebration
of Easter has occasioned no little
controversy, for we find in the first
years of christianity the churches
divided upon the question, until the
Council of Nice (:'325 A. D.) which
fixed the time above stated, for its
celebration. It was deference to an
cient custom, that led the ecclesiasti
cal authorities to adhere to the inetlh
od of determlination by the moon,
and at tile epoch of tile Council of
Nice, there was no oflice of longitudies
to determine the exact hour of the
full moon, that is to say, the precise
moment when the eartil is between
the moon anid the sun in a straight
line, the line of syzygies. "It must
be relnembered" 4says Chambers En
eyclopaldia,) "tllat it is not the actu
al moon in the heavens, nor even tile
mean moon of Astronomers, that
regulates the tinte of EJaster, but an
altogether imaginary moon, whose
periods are so contrived, that the new
(calendar) moon always follows the
real new moon, (sometimes by two,
or even three days.) The effect of
this is, that the 14th of the calendar
mlloon-which had, from the times of
Moses, been considered 'full moon'
for ecclesiastical purposes-falls gen
erally on the 15th or 16th of the real
moon, and thus, after the real full
moon, which is generally on the 14th
or 15th day." In looking up the sub
ject farther, we find the following
statement in a French paper, publish.
ed by the authority of the Diocese of
Nantes :
"They have used an easy method
to facilitate matters, and sacrificed a
little exactitude to simplicity, and
this method is still in use, because, it
gives results ordinarily exact. The
I error besides, is without consequence,
because it can only make a difference
of one day. This mnethlod gives to
tthe lunar monthi thlirty days, when
Itruly it has but twenty-nline days,
twelve hIlours and forty-cighlt minlutes.
This year the ecclesiastical count is in
Sdisagreement several lhours withl as
tronomny, and these hours cause the
full moon to fall on tlhe 9th, instead
of the 8th, and following tlhe law of
:the Council of Nice thley have been
t forced to place la fete tie Pagues, In
Sunday thle 1Gth April."
It is tlierefore a well established
fact, tilhat to-morrow (Sunday) is to
I be Easter, with all of its aceompany
ing ceremonies; thile young ladies
with new dresses, and thle children
withi dyed eggs, &c., wlhich to them,
forms a very important period of
their lives.
State Tax Sales.

Taliaferro rendered thile decision of

of the controversy ; but thlat the val

The New South.
This is the appropriate name for
the country rmaped out by the far
seeing and adventurous carpet-bag
ger, when he packed his carpet-bag
and came down, just after the war,
to enter into his great scheme of re
generation and purification. There
was no thought of self in his under
taking, no idea of robbing anybody,
or stealing anything that could be
found, oh ! no, lie simply "Followed
freedom on thie adventurous tide;"
his mission was peace and good-will
to mankind generally, and to the ne
gro, particularly. In order to carry
out the aims and intentions of such
humane projects, he must first get
power, and this could only be obtain
ed through the working of the Radi
cal party, and the negro vote.
To win the negro to his side,
hie begins by instilling into his
ear the subtile poision of hfatred to
his former owneril, and making dupes
of them, which lie soon learned was
no ditlienlt task. lie obtained pow

\Vell and truly did lie adopt the

t pet-bagger, "Go South, go to the
t New South, there is your Eldorado,
- the land of promise;" for the "South,"
. says Mr. JJames Rledpath, "as a com
pact political power, should have
neither courtesy nor mercy shown it.
It deserves neither pity nor respect.
D Its history is one long, lurid, chroni
cle of crime. The nation has crush

From the above, it is apparent that
to pay these accounts, every dollar of
the subseriptions will be needed, and
eighteen dollars more, and yet the ac
tually necessary repairs are not linish
ed, in order to mnake this Cemetery
respectable. In the name of the dead
and civilization, may we not still ap
peal to the public for the comnpletion
of this work t In the name of justice
and comnion honesty, may we not
appeal to those subscribers that have
not paid their subscriptions f The
property has been purchased, and
these repairs made on the credit of
these subscriptions, and every dollar
collected, has been so appropriated,
and more. The remaining subscrip
tions are now due, for work rendered,
and if not paid, must full upon our
self.
While we thus appeal to some of
the most directly interested members
of this community, we must com
mend the example of the few Jews,
that are citizens of this town, to
whom, without exception, we have
applied, and without exception, have
received a cash subscription, and are
yet, taxed with their own Cemetery;
were thile very people to whom I could
appeal, with tihe very least show of
justice. Would that many who are
more directly interelsted-whlose an
cestors and famuilies are hurried here,
and are yet so sadly neglected, were
even, in proportion to their means,
equally as liberal, or eren just. De
linquentscllt have a standing invitation
to settle.
Respectfully,

MORTON'S CIHANCES
for the Republican nomination are
mnluch stronger than tlhey would seenm
to be at first glance. The darkies are
beginning to understand that Graint's
iimiiediate connection with all the
scoundrels whllose misdeeds are beiing
Ibrought to light by thle denloecratic
House is so palpable that tile Con
vention mnay not dare to nolminate
him, and Morton wjil be their next
choice. IHia adlhesion to Pinchback,
wlhen the best men and coolest hleads
in his party knew tlhat to admit
Pinchback to a seat in the Senate, to
I which ll he had no title, could not fail
to injure tile party, hlas made Morton
Stile new Moses of tile negloea. It is
evident that Mortoni cares for noth
ing but his own success, and that hIis
strength does not lie in his poIpularity
I witil tle leaders of hllis lparty, but
with the Republican negro voters.
Thie party managers favor Conkling,
because it is accepted as certain that
neither party can win, if it fails to
carry New York. The 35 electoral
votes of that State will, to a certainty3,
decide the contest ; and if Conkling
can coutrol the delegation for that
State, hlie will be in a Iposition to com
mand the nomination. If not, Mor
ton will be the strongest man.
FRAUDS! FRAUDS! FRAUDS!
Henry H. Finley, of St. Paul, Minn.,
who was employed by tihe Intelior
Department as an attorney to work
iup tile frauds in the Land Office, has
discovered evidence of tihe most
startling character implicating ex
Secretary Delano, ex-assistant Secre
tary Cowen, and two United States
Senators. Upon reporting these facts,
a few day ago, Finley was notified
tllat hIis services wese no longer re
quired, as the Government dlid not
think it necessary to continue the in

A NARIROW ESCAPE FOR THE EX-SE3

A few weeks since, a young girl,
he:ting a baby in her arms, called'
11upon a lady of this city, whose name
is prolinently connected with an ef
fort to refot in abandoned women, and
asked for relief. The girl told the
old story. A year before, she had
come to Washington to secure em.
ployment. An accident threw her i:
the way of ex-Senator Pomeroy, who.
represented that lihe had great ingn.
ence in the Department, and could
' seeure her a position. He put her

excuses, but managed to keep lie

to the lady above referred to, upum

was advised to go to tile wife of the
ex-Senator, and repeat her tale. She
f finally consented, and with her babe
in her arms, wended her way to the
princely residence ot the ex-Senator,
and timidly rang the bell. She told
, the servant who responded that she

"Here she is," was the reply; and
the servant pointed to a richly attired

ISpecial T.legraphic Correopondeace 61 tr
Courier-Journali
Washington, March '27.-The judil
ment of the United States Suptae0
Com t in the cases from Kentucky ii
Louisiana, involving the enforceseI
acts, which has been so long deferna
has come at last. It creates a mnrkdI
sensation in Washington, and reall
marks an epoch in the history of th
court and American politics. Set
years ago the court did not dam t
grapple with and set aside the ret*
olutionary legislation of a Radical
Congress, for fear that it would itself
be swept away. Hence any amount:
of dishonorable and cowardly evassio
of a sworn duty. But the advent Of
a Democratic House of bepresental'
tires, and the improved tone of pib
lic sentiment, have put nerve into the
judges to do their duty.
The decision of to-day, if it doeS
not go the full length, certainly 90
very far in the right direction. The
following is a summary of the points
utiled, which I have received from the
very highest legal sources ;
The first case is that of Reese Wn
Forshee, fiow Kentucky, who were
indicted for refusing the vote of a *
gro because lie did not present prod
that lie had paid the tax as required
by the laws of Kentucky. The e'
ond was the celebrated Grant
case. In the first ease, the court ll
that the third and fourth sections d
the enforcement act of May 31, I185
under which the indictments We*s
found, were unconstitutional, beesno
general in their character and not
confined to the hindrance or preve"
tion of the parties' right to vote 0
account of race or color. There wa
no other statute to support the i-'
dictment. In this decision the chief
justice and all the judges concurrs,
except Mr. Roscoe Conkling's nom'
inee, Ward Hunt, of New York.
In the Grant parish case, the court
ruled that the indictment which wa
found under the sixth section of the
