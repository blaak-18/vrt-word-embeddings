THE FREE WAREHIOUsE seems 0f
the signal of a war of storage pri- men
cesin Grand Ecore. Some one is sinca

MONDAY AND TUESDAY were
wet and dreary days. The rain
fall was very heavy.
T. P. CHAPLI, ESQ., has been
appinted by Governor Nicholls
assistant District Attorney for the
Parish of Natchitoches. Mr.
Chaplin is a fine young lawyer,
and the appointment is an emi- c
hently fit one.
THE SUPPER given for the ben- RIu

lUdies' at the Lacost Building, on
tfeasday night, was a signal sue

s iould have been larger, never
theless the parties who did at
tend d(lid ample justice to the
Sviands as well as to the treasury.
Dancing was indulged in by young
ind old, and a good time was
"had generally. We understand
that the Ladies' intend giving an
' other Supper after Lent, and we
hope the attendance will be large
And the success gratifying.
Wu HAVE had the pleasare of an

with us will be long and pleasant.
