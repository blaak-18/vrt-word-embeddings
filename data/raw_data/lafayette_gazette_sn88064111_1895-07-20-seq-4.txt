OLD ENGLtSH FARMbOUSES
ThM stll meem I/ Whik.h 3lderw-lswer
S Wil Was LCtmpended.
Through the open window, by which
Dorcas sits picking off the elder-blos
soms to make my lady's favorite
cosmetic, comes the sound of the hum
ming of the bees in the herb garden
just outside, and the snip-snip of Mar
gery's scissors as she cuts the fragrant
lavender, and looks with some satis
faction at the promising crops of dill
and marjoram. When she comes inabe
will, with Dorcas' nimble assistance,
strip the little blue blossoms front
their stalks, and, as they are nice and
dry already, place them in a bag of
muslin, in the big earthen pot
honored by the appellation of the
"great pot," in contradistinction to its
neighbor the "lesser pot." Besides
the fragrant lavender water, and the
cooling velvety-feeling elder-flower es
sence, there must ere the year be
passed be added other sweet toilet wa
ters, the old cabbage-rose tree by the
orchard wall must render assistance,
and the cowslips, whose delicate scent
is to pervade my Lady Betty's chamber.
A delicacy which is now well-nigh
forgotten, although it is still to be
found in old farmhouses, is the dam
son cheese. Why this delightful con
serve should be called a cheese beats
the comprehension of mortal man, for
it is neither like a cheese in shape,
manufacture, color, nor taste, but a
cheese it is called, and a cheese it will
remain as long as it survives the op
position of its arch enemy, cheap dam
son jam, which, by the by, is seldom
made of damsons at all, but of small
unripe qualities in the common sloe
which were well-known to the house
wives of old, but are now almost uni
versally neglected. Sloe wine is no
mean tipple, and if kept for some years
resembles port closely.
It is strange, indeed, in these days of
adulteration that sloe port does not
take the place of logwood sirup. Sloe
gin is still to some degree popular,
though its composition is commercial
ly doubtful. In the old days some
bushels of sloes were each year con
sumed by every still room worthy of the
name. Elderberries were also in great
demand, and although the wine made
from them can hardly be said to be
rich or generous, it is, when heated
with spices and sugar, a drink not to
be despised on a cold winter's night.
So many and so various were the
contents of the still room that we in
these degenerate days are apt to won
der how all these delicacies were con
sumed. Our grandparents, however,
were not at loss on this score. "The
more the merrier" was their motto.
and well they acted up to it. The
uncles and cousins in London, and, in
fact, town mice generally, were the for
tunate recipients of frequent hampers
of country commodities, among which
the results of the labor of the house
keeper and still-room maids were very
conspicuous. Candied orange leaves,
damson cheese and elder-flower water
were things nat to be had in perfection
in town. The town cousins did not,
however, return the hampers empty,
but crammed with oysters and other
such comestibles, which were easier to
obtain in London town, so that a sys
tem of friendly barter was carried on.
These things are now no more. No
more does the stage coach deliver at
the Saracen's Head or the Elephant
and Castle baskets containing stout
stone jars of Mistress Margery's special
quince marmalade or pickled beans;
the hamper, when it exists at all, has
degenerated into a mere pair of fowls
and some butter and eggs. The glory
of the still room has departed. Elder
flower wine and cowslip water are
things of the past, and the place of
wormwood wine knows it no more.

LULLABIES FOR CATTLE.
Hlow the Danishl Peasant Lures Htis Herds
Together.
Among the Danish peasants the
primitive instrument known as the lure
is used for the purpose of soothing the
cattle herds, and calling them together
in the evening, precisely as the cowboy
does on the plains at night. He rides
in a circle, gradually narrowing into a
"round-up." The cattle lie down and
drop off into rest and slumber under
the witchery of a human voice known
to them-the voice serving the purpose
of the lure.
The cattle are collected together in
two or three small herds, the property
of so many different families, and in
June they are sent up into the Scandi
navian alpine meadows, which are no
sooner bare of snow than the regular
twenty hours' sunshine and the twen
ty-four hours' daylight cover every
single foot below the glaciers with the
most nutritious and juicy grass sward.
Hlere they thrive well, and grow
rapidly fat. They are in charge of the
oldest peasant girls of the families
that own the cattle, but they do not
herd them. They go loose very large
ly. Thc Danish pauvrette is there to
milk the cows. and to convert the dairy
piroduce into butter and cheese.
It is in tile evening, when the herd is
recalled from the surrounding pastures,
that the lure comes into play. Many
of the girls become quandam artistes
in its use, and manage to evoke a good
deal of music from the primitive in
strument. It has, however, also a
purely romantic use, mnore especially
among the high-spirited peasants of
Terendheim districts of northern Nor
way.
When a peasant girl has an engaged
swain at work on the home farm he is
supposed to be on the lookout for a
lure signal from his prospective bride
at any time, but more especially so on
the Sabbath morning. Selecting the
most commanding peak above the val
ley in sight of the home farm,, she seats
herself on its summit at sunriise, send
ing down over the beetling crags and
canyons the choicest lure selections
she can conjure with. It is aichallenge
to her lover's devotion and punctuality,
and woe to him if a prompt'and melo
dious reply on the home lure is not at
once forthcoming, for she is entitled
to demand any act of penance which
she deems adequate to his offense.

PERSONAL AND LTEAARY.
-BEnwell was too great a dunce to
know how good his "Life of Johnson"
really was. So far as known, he wrote
it simply to gratify his itch for writ
ing, and had no idea of its excellence.
-Emperor William has sketched the
general plan of a history of the war of
1870, and has commissioned Prof. Li[nd
ner, of the university of Halle, to write
it. It is to be ready in time for the
celebration in September, and will be
issued in an edition of 100,000 copies.
-Bishop Wesley J. Gaines of
Georgia, .the new star in the theolog
ital firmament, is a colored man of vast
prop)rtions. He is said to have a won
derful fund of oratory, originality, and
wit, a man who believes in putting, as
he expresses it. lots of ginger into his
sermons and who realizes his senti
ments.
-President Faure of France, when
on his travels, is accompanied by two
valets, one of whom has the single
duty of looking after the president's
wardrobe. This, however, is no light
task, as the number of suits and cos
tumes which the president is obliged
to carry about is considerable.
-Col. Thomas Wentworth Higgin
son says of Oliver Wendell Holmes: "It
was uncertain to him, and always re
mained uncertain, whether his main
claim to fame was to rest upon his pro
fession or upon literature. Outsiders
generally made up their minds that he
always clung to the laurels that came
from both, but in his early years lie
undoubtedly preferred his profession."
-If Henry A. Dupont goes to the
United" States senate from Delaware
he will add one more to the number of
millionaires in that body, and will be
the first really rich man to sit for Del
aware. He is not an idle or a luxuri
ous man, as it has been the way of the
Duponts for a century to learn the
powder-making business, and to work
at it, at first .with their hands and
later in the executive department of
the office.
-William S. Steel, chief coiner of
the United States mint, whose resigna
tion, tendered more than a year ago,
has recently accepted by President
Cleveland, had been in continuous
service for thirty-four years. Ile en
tered the institution in 1861 as assist
ant weigher in the deposit weigh
room. He was made chief coiner in
1885. and since that time the entire
coinage output of the government has
been under his supervision.
-D-r. Gladstone has been telling
about his present manner of life. He
gets up at G o'clok in the morning, hav
ing had about seven hours of sound
sleep; takes his bath, shaves, goes into
the garden, or (in rainy weather) does
a little reading, and at seven sits down
to breakfast. Then lie goes to church
(every day), and on his return settles
down to work on his correspondence.
After luncheon he takes a walk or
drive, if the weather permits. He sit'i
down to dinner at eight, and half-past
ten finds him in his bedroom.
-Mine. de Chevreuse, a representa
tive of one of the noblest families in
France, declined the honor which
Napoleon wished to confer on her, that
of being maid of honor to his sister-in
law, the queen of Spain. She after
ward became Josephine's dame du
palats. but always affected to look
down on the imperial court. One day
she went to a reception at the
Tuileries, blazing in diamonds. "What
splendid jewels," remarked Napoleon;
"are they all real?" "Mon Dieu! sire,
I really don't know, but at any rate
they are quite good enough to wear
here."
-Digging up a coffin in order to ob
tain memoirs of the first Napoleon
hardly seems necessary nowadays.
That was done though, it is said, for
those of Planat de la Faye, his orderly
officer, which were recently published.
His widow had only three copies of the
memoirs printed, and deposited one in
her husband'r coffin, after having it ex
humed with great trouble. When she
died she left directions that the book
should be printed from the other two
copies, but as they could not be found,
the executors were obliged to take out
and open the coffin again, and it in
from that copy that the book was
printed.

-Be Was Safe.--Little Jack prays

one time for a short journey, and that

usual. "'Bless papa and take care of

suddenly he raised his head and lIs
