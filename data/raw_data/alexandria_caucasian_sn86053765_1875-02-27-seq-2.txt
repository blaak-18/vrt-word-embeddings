Mad 1>oö . — Tfiero was no littl«*
excitement in town oil Tuesday
morning about'a^inad «log who was
roasting a ion ml biting everything
he could reach. Tho chase was an
excititing one and developed sev
eral amusing incident». Tony val
iantly shouldered a double barrel
and bravely started in pursuit, but
when the ni. d. took both barrels of'
tho gnn in his month, Tony songlit
safety in hasty tlight Strut: g out
alter m. d. was an eager crowd,
horses, foot and dragoons, armed
with guns, pistols, sticks, rakes and
«•very other kind of offensive wea
f>ons and the pursuit was long and
protracted. We were in at the
death, when the m. d. was over
taken by our friend Billy C. who
lodged a well directed shot in his
side.
We learn that tho dog has al
ready bitten. several others and
also a cow, and we advise our citi
zens to be on the look out for other
cases.
It A kt Ä11LK. —After getting up
liere on Monday morning with fly
ing colors at .'t o'clock A. M. T otir
popular packet, the Bart Able,
Capt. Dick Siiinott, had the mis
fortune to blow out one of her
cylinder heads and to brciik one ol
her shafts. This .occurred some
where about Montgomery and she
came down running but on« wheel
on Wednesday.
It will take some time to repair
the damages, but meanwhile, Capt.
Ninnott informs us, ho will
have another boat in the trade,
with which he will be on time Mon
day.
('apt. Sinnot has tho earnest
sympathy of our entire community
in this tho third misfortune he has
had this season, having lost the
Kabine by sinking and having once
before broke the Hart Able just as
she had started out on lier first
trip. C'apt. Pick deserves better
ot Fate and she is a veritable jade
to play him so many scurvy tricks.
W We are obliged to the Wash

GRANT'S SOUTHERN POLICY.
The sending of Sheridan to New
Orleans and the Military interfer
ence with the organization of oui
House of lte presentat ives ; the
sending of the second sub-coin
uiitte to New Orleans ; tho revo.
lut ionary passngo of tho Civil
rights bill through the lower house
of Congress ; The outrageous mes
sage in the ease of Arkansas; iu
the face of a favorable report of the
Arkansas coSiiiiittec ; The tone of
eveiy single one of his organs and
all of his reported utterances of late
go to make up a clear indication of
what sort of a policy Grant, the
would bo Dictator, is going to pur
sue with reference to the Southern
States. All these things conclu
sively prove that wo are to be sub
jected to a most vigorous, relentless
and bitter persecution, such as will
lind a parallel only in tho heartless
dismemberment, ^and brutal treat
men t of Poland. Grant, will be
ready as soon as Congress adjourns
to heap any indignity and do any
act of oppression that will give satis
faction to his consuming hatred of
I ho Southern people, who have
dared to oppose his third term
scheme.
If what is now known as the
Caucus Hill should pass Congress,
and there is but little doubt but
that it will pass so modified as to
allow him-to suspend the writ
habeur. corpus in tho Southern
States; we will be treated to a taste
of military trials and perhaps f>
military executions. To all man
ners of punishment and oppression
that he thinks well calculated to
subjugate us so that in 1870 we will
be ready then to vote for him or
not to vote at all, which will suit
him as well. He is determined that
Southern States shall cast their
votes for his election to the third
term in 1870, and it will make
but little difference to him
whether their votes are actual
ly cast for him or not, he will pur
sue the same course the Returning
Hoard did and say they ought to
have gone for him and so count
them.
Louisiana is particularly under
the bann of his displeasure ami wiU
be made to suffer the most, it he ob
tains the grant of power be is now
asking at the hands of his servile
Congress, lie will take great plea
sure in turning us over to the ten
der mercies of Sheridan, the Inf a
mous, and for all that we can do to
prevent if, he may iu laet treat us j
as "banditti."
Now, where are we to look for re-j
lief? To the democratic House of
Representatives elect? They
not meet until December. To
Northern people i They are pow
erless to help us and they would not
if they could. Do they not tell us
that it is better for us to sufïer, that
our sufferings will enable them to
cany the election in 1S70? Where
then, shall we look ? To the courts
and to trial by jury, c the bulwark
of civil liberty? They are power
less, for the'eivil has been subordi
na ted to the military power by the
suspension ot the writ of habeas cor
and weeping justice will tell us
from her temples and sanctuaries,
that her hands are tied—her scales
broken and her sword taken from
her.
Where then shall we turn for re
lief ? Shall we turn like the stag at
bay and lunge at our pursuers ?—
^' as ' we uro lo<> und faint
P Cur course ié plain, but it is one

Ialrous Southern people, and is ont

and the pitiless hounds that have

may the more easily throttle us at

bad blood between the races. The f'au
canian, of which he is the editor, hud done
what it «.mild. as extracts from ils colninns
shows, to excite hostile feelings and en
roll ruga nssassinalion. It, indorsed (lie
C'nllax massacre, and tho associate editor
took a hand in llqi killing. Il, advised
revolutionary proceedings to oust all Ke'
logjrites when the editor knew, as was at
last c.onstrai I toedmit, that in llieelec

Nachitochi s, and id lier parishes, as show n
by comparison'with the registration, was

had the lace to say Unit many colored
men had voted for M c K nkiîy , found his
cheek insufficient, to attribute I lie majori

tin* part of the blacks.
If the committee will as thoroughly in

who come forward to testily in behalf ol

will have a report to make «littering iii
important particulars thai ot the

Washington.
We are indebted to the kindness
of a friend for handing usa copy of
the <'inciiuiati Commercial, contain
ing tins above. We could not ol»
ofjtain a coj>y ol the day previous to
j which he alludes, to sen what sort
jof a report it published of our tes
' tiniony before the, Congressional
1Committee, but judging "from tin
| foregoing editorial comments its
rcport was a tissue of misrepresent

We shall for our own satis
!f ar , ion, get from our Committee u
copy iu f uil of our whole t
I iinony
as taken by the short, hand Repor
ter and publish it for our own .sat
isfaction.
Meanwhile we ptoposc to have a
little say with the Comiucrcia-l.
\\ hen the ('ommercia! says that we
testified •'to that which he knows
to be a wide distanco from the
truth, ' the Commercial lies, and in
making such a. statement with its
slim knowledge ol the. facts and cir
cumstances, it displays it reckless
ness that induces us to believe that it
'lied maliciously. We did say that
there had been ~>7 homicides since
January 1 sti.s, but wo submitted a
statement in full, taken from t In
criminai records showing that 28 ol
j them were cases where neg:oes had
been killed by negroes, and that
there were only !» eases in seven
years where negroes had been kill
led. by whites, and that not one of
dojthesq homicides was for political
the!causes. How is that as showing
"bad blood between the races f
Extracts from the Caucasian do not
show that "it had done what il
could to excite hostile feelings ant
tojnegroes sa\ that tlic t ^ had not been
allow(( l t0 "
Tlu , c 0lfniierci
encourage assassination," and wo
are obliged to say that again tin
Commercial purposely lent itself to
the. fabrication and circulation of a
vile falsehood.
We plead guilty that, we did en
dorse the Colfax affair, hut not as a
massacre. The hit ter of the Asso
ciate Editor of the Caucasian, pub
lished in the Democrat just, after
the occurrence, which was in the
hands of the ComnjiUee, fully ex
plains his part iu that affair, and
when interrogated upon that point
we referred them to that letter.
We, acknowledge also the advice
as to revolutionary proceedings toj
oust Kelloggites, hut that we werej
constrained to admit that the col-j
ored vote, in Rapides, Natchitoches ;
and other parishes" was nearly j
suppressed in l S 72, as shown by a!
comparison with the registiation, i
that part of the Co mmcrciaCs mann
facturai testimony, is a base fa lui !
cation and vile, slander. We were
not, constraint ■ to admit any such
thing, and we appeal to the record.
We testified that as far as Rapides
was concerned, we were.at the time
teaching .School in the pincwoods
and knew nothing about the regis
tration more than that we heard
■id I intentionally
,lra «' sn : 1,011 its imagination when it
says that we testified that many
colored men had voted for Me
ery. We testified on Hie contiaiy
that our impression was that but
few colored men bad voted for Älc
linery, and that he bad beeu fairly
elected by a majority of white votes.
As to the thoroughness of our cross
examination by Mr. F rye, wo were
on the witness stand from ten
o'clock in the morning until liait
past two in the afternoon, and
while we may be mistake^, we were
then,.and certainly are now, under
the impression that Mr. Frye bad
made but very little out of us. We
were told so by the gentlemen
present and when we ptib.ish the
testimony in full, we think it will
bear us out in saying that we rath
er got the better of Mr. Frye.
We advi<e the Commercial to be
more careful hereafter, and not to
make such reckless charges and
false statements upon such thin
pretexts as it had in our case. It
may be perfectly right for it to try
to build up the radical cause by ly
ing, but we object to the Commer
cial doing such wholesale falsifica
I ion to sustain that tottering fabric.
Draw it mildly Mr. Commercial !
O
IToblcsso .Obligo.
"We were much surprised one day
this week, wlidn wo were asked by
a friend if we had testified before
(he Congressional Committee that
we knew all about the disappear
ance of Iioyd Shorter, and had giv
en the particulars, lie told us that
he had heard so. Now, just what
we did say about Loyd Shorter was
this: that lie and his horse had
hot. h disappeared about the time
when the Metropolitans were here
and had not been seen since. That
we did not know anything at all
about, the matter any more than
that ; and lhat had we known that
lie, was killed ami who killed him
we should have done our duty as
District Attorney, pro tempore and
had an investigation of tho case.
There are gentlemen of this parish
who heard flic whole of our testi
mony. and they will corroborate our
statement above.
Then comes another friend who
tells us that it was reported that
we had voted a split ticket at the
last election. This is again a vile
slander, as Judge Daigreand Capt.
James Jeflries, who had seen us
vote the straight, out White Man's
l'art y from top to bottom and
openly, will both prove.
Just before this we had the Dem
ocrat after us about what lie lmd 1
said of the destruction of the radi
cal newspaper office here some
years ago, but we think we satisfi
ed h iin on that point.
Then again some one tells us that
our fi iends on Hayou Rapides are
dissatisfied with something we said
about Hayon Rapides. We are not
conscious of having said anything
which ought to offend any one and
as we called nobody's name in
whateveij^e may have said about
the possibility of any disturbances
there, quit lifted as was our state
ment thai we meant only the inter
ruption of speakers and did not bc
licvM that'lhere would have bevn
any?of Huit, we are at a loss to
know hominy one has just cause of
offense. §
And then besides our friends at
home we have got the Cinciniiatti
Commercial , St. Louis Republican,
Shreveport Southwestern and other
radical papers alter us with their
comments and altogether, we are
having a rather tough time of it,
because we went before the Com
mittee, after being ticice summoned
by them and without any discretion
to stay away.
Hut all this is only incidental to
the purpose we had iu writing this.
We have put at the head of this ar
ticle two freneh words which we
desire in this case to be interpreted
to mean, that if any more remarks,
reports or innendoes are in circula
tion or contemplated circulation,
that the parties dissatisfied or inter
ested in, the circulation of reports,
remarks or innendoes, will ^o us the !
kindness, as obliged by courtesy, to;
first give us a statement of the!
grievous sins committed by us as |
they understand them, that before j
being condemned we may have an
opportunity of pleading to the in j
dictaient. This much Xoblesne !

A CARD.
Pink villi?, La., )
Feb. 24th, 1875. )
Editor Caucasian:
Dear Sir :-Mr. E. R. Biosnat,
who by a streak of good luck is the
Editor of the Democrat, instead of
occupying quarters elsewhere, less
congenial to his enquiring dinposi
tion, has of late been on an explor
ing expedition, and has been call
ing on most every body in general,
«nid certain part.es in particular,
for explanations to satisfy bis cu
riosity. Since explanations seem
to be the order of the day, I have
concluded to try my hand jnst once
for hick anyhow. If Mr. Biossat,
had considered the wisdom of tin
old saw : People who live in glass
homes should not throw Atones, J
would not have been called upon
to put him on the stand, and to ap
point myself a self constituted cross
examiner to ask him for explana
tions that may bo embarrassing for
him to answer. Strange to say, it
is a letter that this embodiment of
true Democracy, wishes explained
Now, it would have seemed tome
that the subject of letters , or a let
ter, would have been tho last one
Mr. E. Iî. Biossat should have ven
tared upon, considering the difficul
ty he had in explaining seveial let
1er transactions, to tho satisfaction
of the parties interested. If the
facts bad been given the publicity
tliat I now invite Mr. Biossat to
give to his explanations of those
certain transactions, and about
which I will be much more explicit
if he desires it, "the public might
have seen what sort of a Democrat"
and Warehouse keeper he was.
Will this honest gentleman—this
distinf/uished and consistent patriot,
be kind enough to explain to this
community in whose name I now
speak, what became ofthat $1419
of the Public School Fund, for
which he, as Parish Treasurer, was
a defaulter , for which he was sued
and made no defense, and which
was a short time ago paid by his
Securities! I arn yearning jast
now, and I know that this commu
nity is exceedingly anxious to be
informed as to what did become of
that Fourteen Hundred and Nine
teen Dollars of the School Fund.
Will Mr. Biossat, have the still
further kindness to inform "the
public," for whom and in whose
name I «'isk, what became of that
$800 Parish tax funds that was
collected by the Tax Collector of
Vernon Parish and placed iu his
hands, and which has never been
accounted for, ami for the recovery
of which there is now a suit pend
ing? And perhaps Mr. Biossat
will not object to my calling upon
him in the name of "the public" to
explain that little matter of $350
Parish Script, for which the Tax
Colketor has Iiis receipt, and which
also figures in that said suit, now
pending. If Mr. Biossat feels any
delicacy in assuming the burden of
explaining these little matters which
are of course, of no importance, and
do notât all effect him in his posi
tion as the expounder of true Dem
ocratic doctrines and as tiV*» mouth
piece ot "the public," I may tii'<«.d it
my duty to publish tine Wiords ^i
those cases. If the genthUfan
should not be inclined to favor me
with the explanation of those valu
able letter transactions while he
o
was keeping Warehouse, I may be
forcée to ask Dr. E. E. Smart, and
M .
Mr. Phillip Winnfrec of Vernon
Parish, Capt. John C. Mitchell and
Mr. Willie French, Mr. Alexander
Glucksman and others just what
they know about them.
When I presume to ask so high
a dignitary iu tho democratic
party, of which I have always been
and am now, but an humble follow
er as Mr. Biossat ciaims to lie, for an
explanation of these little matters
I like to have the facts and figures
before me with the authorities
ready to show whether tho exnla
datiou is candid. Now Mr. Editor,
if such practices are the test of de
mocracy, and if a man with such a
record can retain a good standing
in society or in the democratic par
ty, I'll none of society or of that
democracy. I apprehend that Mr
Hiossat oversteps the bounds ol
that prudence that should guide
the s'.eps of a man who but narrow- j
ly escaped the Penitentiary, aed
who sacrificed lift friends who «er«
Iiis bondsmen, when lie sets hi»,
self np a public cri tie) and aoral
exemplar. Besides Hi« wise old
saw that I have already qnoted, I
commend another to tlie considera
tion ot Mr. Biossat : "Discretion ia
the better part of valor."
If Mr. Biossat deairea any morm
explanations I will tw happy t*
oblige him, and may ask bin to
explain certain others matte» that
I know of. For the preset! ? I
think Mr. Bibssat will bave all ho
can do to satisfy " the publie* apon
the little mutter» already rsteveito.
Respectfully,
