From the Special Correpondest of the New
York Daily Times.
Wedidaiy; Oct. 14, 1874.
Thlere eanl e li~le doiit that the
1bIdi al carpet-bagging officials were
working in tielr'itsul faslhion to get
up an outrage, by exciting the anger
or the apprehensiona .of the whites,
and getting them to,arm themselves
so as to plOe jhein oq the windy side
of the law. Butthe nqgroes fired on
and despergtely wounded a white
man, and ' ;m put tlenelves in the
very position n wbich they had de
sired to put the white man, that is
to say as th9 first aggrepsors. Then,
came the artesta, the departure from
Coushatta under a aeguard, the in
terceptieo by irmed bands, and the
masscere: It has been believed up
ŽNorth that this was $ mere concerted
business,, that the' safeguard was a
blind, and that the msdascre had
been arranged in Coushatts. But,
fortunately for the honor of the
American race, the people of Cou
shatta cannot be accased of this.
The circunmstances of the case show
conclusively that tihe bloody deed
was achieved without the participa
tion even, much less with. thbeknowl.
edge, of the patties who arrested Hoe.
mer Twitchell, the tax collector, and
lis friends. " o ' + -"
But there is net, and! never has been
since 1868, anmy dream of battling
with the United Ptates, or any thought
of denying the Federal authority.
Just as in Poland, under the influence
of the old ideim, every ten years or
so there would` be a revolution to
prevent the Poles from getting satis
tied with the Romanoffrule, so, I be
lieve, the leadinig party in North Lou
isiana blows tlW emhbers.of class feel
ing, and . , lip a trouble. ~And, to
do the L us3i tga 3h rpet- i~¢
are every w culpable. Tey
get up "ouba es , to make the
Federal BlaeSi ment belle tr tltttlhe
old rebel eMM6bt fi. ailltfiive, and
that white'lslpublicanseaunot live in
Louisiana withot' thel protection of
Uncle Sam'di anifogped nephews.
It might b* said, tiat these things
being e fpy gp wOulR ,.ke waMUMi

Another.lmethod of raisin money
Was the buildtE o ridges, whis5,
b o rWarra t $$7,, thl gh
l et` Vwork done, was worth only
$1,500 a.Oerding to the actual pay
ment to the carpenters. Another
method was. the establishme t of a
Bureau of Emingi'aition, for 'uhich $8,
000 (of scrip Ias Isued..A Bidical
named Myers- was made Prsident,
and he went to Ohio with these funds
and brought back one man named
Van Dusen, who is now schoolmaster
of a colored school at Campte, a small
place ten miles north of Natchitoches.
' That was the first and only effort of
the bureau. Still another swiudle
,was-the gstablishment of a company
s to' create A turnpike road between
the city and. Grand Ecore, witlh an
exclusive privilege of collecting tolls.
The President was a useful election
eering friend, and the Police jury, as
rerepresentatives of the parish, loaned
him $1,500 to commence operations.
i. But he was stopped by an injunction
procured from the Distrist Judge,
SMr. Osborne, who was very averse to
7the whole business. So Boulit ap
plied to the Legislature, and for a
moderate sum obtained a gerryman
dering statute by which, a new dis
'trict was created sliced out of Judge
Osborne's. Into this Myers was in
ducted, and Osborne was flanked.
But the injunction was fatal to the
turnpike company. Myers, hoWever,
passed. judgwnts heartily against the
warrants, but having. somnminkling of
the: feeling of the. citizens, he. and
young Boullt, the Parish Judg~, re
'paired to New Orleans before the in
dignation meeting in June, and-both
of them have remained there ever
since. There is consequently neither
a Parish Court, nor a, District Court
in operation at. the; preut moment.
Boullt, however,; though'hereft of his
son, is not altogether desolate. An.
other son is Parish Attonsey, another
Parish Auctioneer, another ' son, De
puty Treasurer. The T'Teasurer de
,jre is a Mexican naned' 'Eernack,.
who can neither read iqr write, to
young Boullt manages everything,
and. is thie Treasurer is the check on
the Tax Collector, he keeps a vigi
lant eye on his father by being in the
same ofee, ant keeping his books in
the same saf. "a
The School Board is composed of
Dr. BoIllt, our friefid".1yers, (who is 1
not unsuspected of dea4ea tioq in. tin
Post Olice, where hqe 'aistee an ig
norant negro named Charles. LeBoy,
rho became a defaulter to the amount
of $1,500,) and others of the ring.
The parish receives for.schools fromia
the State Treasurer from $15,000 to
$20,000, but there .is only one school;
a colored one, and if it were not, for
the exertions of the Ca holiq Biabo
the rising white generation wo get ,
o ' eduestion whatsooever. To,. the
colored school theresare threetsseh,' 1
era, one Haford Blunt, the State Seas
tor, who c'an neither read nor write,
but who is a member of the Sdlhool "
Board, and appointed himself teacher
with a salary of $100 per motih.
Half of this he gives to a bright yonong
colored woman, who is a teacher, and
a good one. Her name is Miss Lucy
Davis, and she is thoroughly compe.
tent, though even so $50 per mouth is
rather large for the locality. 'The
third teacher is a Canadian colored
man, who gets 875 a month, and who
is not very comtopetent. There is, for
tunately, a very excellent school for
colored Children attached to the cai
thedral, and under the personal slu'
pervision of the good Bishop, where
the teachisg is doerhT'Si~itt ra of
Mercy. Wbe[ e ha been no white
public school sime 1860 il: the citg,
and in. :the pine bills themre are ..no
abhools whatsoever. All is darkness,
indeed, in that region.. .

The carpet-baggers tell ,the Unitqd
States officers that they will be fired
on along the Red River route, but
everywhere. they have been treated
with cordiality, even with excessive
friendliness. The reason is that the
people of Louisiana regard the sol
diers of the Government as friends
and protectors. Everywhere the same
wish is breathed that the results of
the election might be returned by a
board of United States officers. In
fact, the Terrebonne compromise is
heartily disliked, and the one cry is
for a board of oficers. From them
they are sure of truthful returns.

TIIEALD1INE, while issued withl. all the
regdi&rity, has llone of the temporary or
timely interest characteristic of ordinary
peridicals. It is an elegant niscellany
of lmrq, IIjlt and graceful literature; and
a collection of pictures, the rarest speci

Although each succeeding number affonirds
. fresh pleasure to its friends, the real
iale and beauty of the AL DINE will be
most appreciated after it has been bound
up at the close of the year. While other
journalk.may claim superior cheapness, as

the ALmanI is a unique and original con

ART 1)EPARTMENT,' 1874.
The illnetrations orethe AWtI lm have
won a world.wide reputation, and, in the
art ceuntres of Europe it is an admitted fact
that its wood cuts are.examples of the
highest perFcti'ot gver. tittauned. 'The
commeji prejudice in favor of 'steel plates'
is raplily lielding to'ea mre educated and
discriminating taste which recognizes the
advantages and superior artistic quality
withgreater-facility of.production. The
wooaL.ets of the ALIIEI possees all the.
delidacy and elaborate finish of the most
costly etepl plate, while they. aftbrd a bet

To: fully realize the wonderful work
whiaciele Aldine' e doingfor the cause of
art culture in Atineric, it is only neces
sary toeaonsider the cost to the people of
any other decenirepreaentatious of: the
productions of great painters.
In addition to designs by the membme
of the Ntiimnal Academy-and other. noted
Ainerican 'rtiits, the Aldine will repro
dunce eanqailk of tie'best foreign masters,
selected with a view to the highest artis
tic success and ý*stat general interest.
Thus the enbscninr to the Aldine will, at
a triling cost, enjoy in his own home the
