WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
L Cha1mpion American Comic Paper !
t Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
" can artists, and contributed to by the
most lopular humorists and satirists of
t the day.
LWill Oats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has heoinme t lhe establlished lllluorous allld
t satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continued the first yiear as I
t monthly, then, to satisfy the demtiand of
the pihlie, it was changed to a fortnight
t Iv. Mtill continuing its good work of
*hitting folly as it flies, and showing up I
t the political and social shas 1by its
I masterly cartoons and lpungenit editorials,
it achieved even greater success thalnl
before, and was recognized as the ablest
- nld brighltest of its class. Since then we
a have yielded still further to the pnllic
s demand, and now publish Wild Oats
e weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its iutriunsic nwrits, be
t ing the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever ipublished in this country.
t Among thte artists especially engaged
to furiishb illustrations for Wild Oats are
t Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth. Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels,
t Stuckhardt, Day, Polalld, and several ý
others who are yet known to fame.
t In its literary departments Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
e pages, by the best hmunorous, satirical,
i and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs i
f will be sparkling, original and pointed,
Wild Oats will be first-chlass in every
particular, and on this account may be
t taken into the best families without fear
s or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fas
t tidious.

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause, of the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR HIT
TERRS " Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of VIN
EGAR BITTERs in healing the sick of
every diseaseo man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of DR. WALK
ERt's VINEGAR BITTERS are Aperient, Dia
phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious, Laxa
tire. I)iuretic. Sedative. Counter-Irritant,
Sudorific, Alterative, and Anti-Bilious.

Bilious, Remitteut, and In.
termittent Fevers, which are so
nrevaient in the valleys of our great
rivers throughout the U'nited States,
especially those of the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, Arkansas, Red, Colo

Alabala, Mobile, Savannah. Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly sO during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
compauied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a"
powerful illtlulenlce upon these vari
ous organs. is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the ptlpose
equal to DR. J. WALKER'S VINE4AR
BITT'ra, as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are lolaed, at the same time
stimulating the secretionis of the liver.
and generally restoring the healthy fun
tions of the digestive organs.
Fortify the body against dis
ease by purifying all its fluids with
VINErGAR IiTrlits. No epidemic cans
take hold of a system thus foire-armed.

Sore Eves, etc. In these, as in all other
constitutional Diseases, WA\LRa's Vax
EGARBITTIERS have shown their great cur
ative powers iin the most obstiuate and
intractable cases.
For Inflanmmatory and Chronic
Rheunmatism, Gout, Bilious, Remit
tenut and Internittent Fevers, Diseases
of the Blood, Liver, Kidneys and Bladder,
these Bitters have no equal. Such D)is
eases are caused by Vitiated Bhlid.

Plumbers, Type-setters, Gold-beaters and
Miners, as they advance in life, are sub

las, Itch, Scurds, D)iscolorations of the
Skin, Humors and Diseases of the Skin of
whatever namne or nature, are literally
dug up and carried out of the system in a
short time by the usen of these Bitters.
Pin, Tape, and other Worms,
lurking in the system of so nanny thou
sands, are effectually destroyed and re
. moved. No system of medicine, no ver
mifuges, no anthelatinities will free the
system from worms like these Bitters.
'or Female Complaiuts, in young
or old, married or single, at the dawn of
womanhood, orthe turn of life, these Ton
ic Bitters display so decided an influence
that improvement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
whenever you tind its impurities bursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores; cleanse it when you find it ob
strueted and sluggish in the veins; cleanse
it when it is foul; your feelings will tell
yoa when. Keep the blood pure, and the
health of the system will follow.

Is widely known
as one of the most
effectual renm. e
dies ever discov
ered tfr cleans- c
ing the sysrtem
and purifying the ii
blood. It has d
stood the test of
years, with a con
stantly growing
reputation, lbased on its intrinsic virtues,
and sstutained by its remarkable cures.
So mild as to be safe and Ineeticial to c
children, and yet so searching as to
eftectually purge out the great corrup- a
tions of the blood. such as the serf-.
ulous and syphilitic contamination. e:
Impurities or diseases that have lurked P
in the system for years soon yield to C
this powerful antidote, and disappear. t
lIInce its wondertul cures, many of
which are publicly known, of Scrofula, t
and all scrofulous diseases, Ukerse ,,
Eruptions, and eruptive disorders cf tl
the skin, Tumors, lilotcheus, BIi s, tl
Pimnples, Pustules, Sores, St ec
Anthony's Fire, Rose or E~ y
sipelas, Totter, Salt Rheum, a
Scald Head, Riungworm, and in- Ir
ternal Ulcerations of the Uterwi, E
Stomach, antd Liver. It also cures
other complaints, to which it would not
seem especially adapted, such as DrIop o
sy, Dyspepsia, Fits, Neuralgia, ci
Heart D)isease, Female Weak*. c
ness, Debility, and Leutcorrnh a, s
when they are iLaniSfetations of the
scrofulous poisons.
It is an excellent restorer of health ni
and strength in the Spring. By renew- e:
ing the appetite and vigor of the diges
tive organs, it dissipates the depression e'
and listless langoer of the season. s,
Even where no disorder appears, people
feel better, and live longer, for cleansing
the blood. The system moves on with
renewed vigor and a new lease of life.

which arise from malarious, marsh, or

No one remedy I louader
called for by the necessities
of the American people than
a sure and safe cure for
Fever and Ague. Such
we are now enabled to offer,
with a perfect certainty that
it will eradicate the disease, and with assur
ance, founded on proof, that no harm can
arise front its use in any quantity.
That which protects from or prevents this
disorder must be of immense service in the
communities where It prevails. Prereation
is better than cure; for the patient escapes the
risk which he must run in violent attacks of
this baleful distemper. This "Ctars" expels
the miasmatic poison of Fever au Agel
from .the system, and prevents the develop
ment of the disease, if taken on the drst
approach of Its premonitory symptoms. A
great superiority of this remedy over any
other ever discovered for the speedy and cer
tain cure of lntermittents is, that it contains
no quinine or miniieral; consequently it pro.
duces no quinism or other injurious erects
whatever upon the constitution. Those cured
by it arc lef It as healthy as if they had never
had the disease.
Fever and Ag.n is not alone tse oem.
seqma'llee of the aniasnaLtic poison. A great
variety of disorders arise from its irritationm,
among which are Nemnlglh, Rhllemm.

and consequently cures them all alike. It is
an invaluable protectiou to immigrants and
persons travelling or temporarily residing in
the malarious districts. If taken occasion
