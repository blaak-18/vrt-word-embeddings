,--The Gazette was exactly
3. right in its reference to people tatking I
cane from cars loaded for forward- t
e ing. It should be understood that 4
the farmer is the one who suffers the
a loss of every sugar cane taken from
to his shipment; as settlements are made
d on delivery weights. While in the
r single instance it may seem a very
e small matter, still in the aggregate
it becomes very important, and oc
casions great loss to those who can
illy afford it. It certainly would
not be permitted for any one to take
cotton from a bale. If such were
done it would be considered in the
light of a theft, and the party would
a be held amenable to the law. Why 1
g then should not the same rule apply c
:e to those who take cane not belonging
e to them. Now that our people are
it going extensively into cane culture,
d they must be protected in this par
D ticular matter. Let the parish and
II corporations pass proper laws af- c

Christmas Tree at Duson.
Le Few people outside of the imme
re diate vicinity of Duson know of the
i good that has been accomplished by
the Bethel Sunday School. Mr.
ty Lastie Hoffpauir, the zealous presi
dent of this worthy institution, was
in Lafayette Tuesday and informed
re The Gazette that the membership
e' of the school was steadily increasing
d and numbered at the present time
over sixty. Christmas eve, the
f
public school house which is the
place of meeting of the Bethel
school, was crowded with people
who had assembled to participate in
the festivities attending the fitting
up of a large Christmas Tree, laden
with handsome presents for the little
children. The committee of ar
o rangements were Mesdames Indai
, Clark, John Trahan and Messrs. WV.
T. Nickles, Lastie Huffpauir and
Thomas Huffpauir who deserve a
great deal of credit for the thorough
manner in which the whole program
was carried out.

Literary Note.
The second edition of the Decem
ber World's Fair Cosmopolitan
brings the total up to the extraordi- i
nary figure of 400,000 copies, an
unprecedented result in the history
of magazines. Four hundred thou
sand copies--a2oo tons-ninety-four
million pages---enough to fill 20oo
wagons with 2ooo pounds each-in
a single line, in close order, this
would be a file of wagons more than
a mile an a half long. This means
not less than 2,ooo000,000ooo readers, scat
tered throughout every town and 5
village in the United States. The
course of The Cosmopolitan for the
past twelve months may be com
pared to that of a rolling snowball; c
more subscribers means more money
spent in buying the best articles and '
best illustrations in the world; better
illustrations and better articles I
mean more subscribers, and so the
two things are acting and reactingA
upon each other until it seems pro- j
bable that the day is not far distant
when the magazine publisher willA
be able to give so excellent anarticle
that it will claim the attention of
every intelligent reader in the
country.
