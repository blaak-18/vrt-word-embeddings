WALTOM, AHTI-KLAH CHAMPION
BY PHILLIP KINGSLEY, in Minneapolis Journal
Ten years ago Walton was a Kan
sas City electrical supply salesman.
He did business with the state de
partments here and in 1913 moved
here and opened an office as consult
ing engineer. He became a city com
missioner and in 1919 was elected
mayor. He was known as a union
labor man and, always hfts been as
sociated with the radical wing of the
democratic party.
In his reign as mayor he saw the
rise of the Klan to political power.
One of the largest initiations ever
conducted took place while he was
mayor. He took no stand on the
matter. There was a strike in the
packingtown and a Negro strike
breaker was lynched. The city police
did little to stop the mob. The town
was wide open for a while, but Wal
ton fired his chief of police and per
sonally led raiding squads into sa
loons and dives until he had cleaned
the town.
Cedar 6651
Had Eye for Spectacular
He used to march with his police to
the Christian church to attend ser
vices. He always had an eye for the
spectacular and in politics was quick
to seize on the current nostrum that
appealed to the imagination of the
crowd.
In 1922, while he still was mayor,
he was made the nominee of the re
construction league of the state for
governor. This organization, led by
the Oklahoma Leader, a radical pub
lication, had sensed in Walton a
winning political figure after his city
success against the conservative dem
ocrats. The league was formed on
the line of the Nonpartisan league of
North Dakota, capitalizing the dis
content of the farmer and the
union labor sentiment. Their tactics
were to bore into the old party. The
Shawnee convention of this or
ganization in 1921 indorsed Wal
ton on a radical platform. He went
into the campaign and although he
lost in the capital and had most of
the big state papers against him he
won in the state by the biggest ma
jority that any governor ever re
ceived.
Staged Famous Barbecue
He jumped into the limelight with
his famous inauguration barbecue,
where all the farmers were invited to
come in their overalls. He turned
out the militia and gave the state
three days of the wildest kind of a
picnic. He was the idol of the plain
people, their governor and friend. He
was going to turn the agricultural
and mechanical college back to them,
take out the classics from college
courses and get back to dirt and
grease. He was going to clean out
the bank thieves from the state, re
form the budget and get down to
economies to relieve the farmer from
tax burdens.
H. R. FRYE
To. 4115
Today, despite failure to do any of
these things, he still can draw great
crowds on a new issue. Though he
has broken away from the recon
struction league and led them into
the camp of the enemy, he is re
building a powerful state machine.
On the Ku Klux Klan issue he is
planning to become politically im
pregnable, become senator, or vice
presidential candidate.
Call Walton Traitor
The dream of the little group of
idealists whose work contributed so
largely to Walton’s election soon
were found hopeless. Today they call
Walton a traitor. They found that
Walton was not a true radical but a
shallow thinker and a political op
portunist who had used them and
dropped them. The true, unselfish
radicals will never go back to his ban
ner, although they hate the Ku Klux
Kla as much or more than he does.
He has put them and many other
groups of good Oklalfuna citizens In
an ineffective and perplexing situa
tion. If they oppose him they are
accused of being “Klan.” . He has
muddled the waters and forced the

issue so cleverly that there is only
one thing for the majority to do —go
with him.
Walton’s first act which threw
down the wrath of his supporters was
his action in the Agricultural and
Mechanical college presidency. He
had promised to make George Wilson,
an Oklahoma school teacher, presi
dent of the college. He dfd not keep
his promise. Farmers and labor del
egates called on him and forced him
to make the appointment. Later, he
fired Wilson.
The Leader, on July 25, announced
it was through with him, quoting
Browning’s “The Lost Leader”—
“Just for a handful of silver He left
us,” etc.
Banking Situation Bad
The banking situation in the state
had been in a bad way and depositors
had lost millions in failures and liqui
dations under state bank managers
who looted and fled' the state. The
farmers and labor group had the gov
ernor appoint Joe Strain, in whose
honesty everyone believed. Strain
took office. He found an attorney
asking $45,000 fee for services in a
small bank liquidation. Then Strain
was fired. E. T. Byrum was put in
as bank commissioner, although he
had had no other experience in
finance than managiug Waltou’s po
litical campaign in Tulsa. The state
banking law states that the commis
sioners must have had five years
banking experience.
About this time the scandal in
“pardons and paroles” began to
break. From Jan. 6, last, Governor
Walton had extended 253 acts of ex
ecutive clemency at the McAlester
penitentiary.
Miss Sue Bonds of Okmulgee coun
ty, was attacked in 1918. Her fiance
Holden H. Vance, was overseas. She
died a year later in Arkansas, brok
enhearted. Ira Williams was con
victed for this crime and sentenced to
25 years in prison. He was a travel
ing salesman.
Paroled Girl's Attacker
May 18, last, Walton paroled him.
Vance wrote the governor a harsh
letter and the parole was revoked.
In the meantime, Williams had fled
and still is at liberty.
In 1912 Charles T. Reuter, an at
torney, was murdered. Guy McKenzie
was convicted and sentenced to life
imprisonment' for the murder. He
had conspired with the attorney’s
wife to kill him. McKenzie was par
oled by former Governor Robertson
two years ago. He was caught boot
legging and was returned. June 15,
Walton paroled him.
There is a long list of such cases,
reaching up to two days ago. This
list of paroles includes Dick Ivey,
bank bandit, who killed a bank
cashier at Ketchum while on parole.
The list includes 158 felons, 55 par
doned and the remaining 103 receiv
ed commutations or reprieves.
Executive clemency has been ex
tended to 29 murderers.
Defends Actions
The “leave of absence” is an insti
tution established by Walton, under
which convicts are released for var
ious periods. There is no record' of
the number of these cases.
Governor Walton annouuced early
in his term that he would not permit
anyone to die in the electric chair.
Instead of reducing taxes to the
farmers, the governor has piled on
expenses until today deficiency war
rants totaling $177,722 have been
issued. The bankers and farmers
have been uneasy over the situation.
Twenty men, most of them former
policemen when Walton was mayor,
are kept as a personal bodyguard for
the governor, drawing state funds.
There ‘are five at his side nearly all
the time, even at night.
Vetoed $6,000,000 Budget
At the close of the last session
Walton vetoed $6,000,000 in appro
priations and vetoed a refund of sl,-
THE CALL OF THE NORTH
000,000 to oil companies. Most of
his added expenses since have been
in his war on the klan.
These are chief points in his rec
ord leading to the martial law per
iod. This began Aug. 14 last.
The immediate cause of the proc
lamation of martial law at Tulsa was
the whipping of Nate Hantaftian, a
bootlegger. He was whipped with the
aid and consent of the police of that
city, court records are said to show.
He was not whipped, because he was
selling whisky, but because he had
gossiped that he had paid protection
money to the police. Thus Okla
homa’s “insurrection” may be laid
indirectly at the door of the mockery
of prohibition enforcement.
There was not talk of impeachment
or any extraordinary session of the
Oklahoma legislature until the mar
tial law and his “fight to the death”
campaign against the klan. The
charges which will be made against
him rest entirely upon his usurpation
of dictatorial power and his new reign
of military absolutism. He admits
all these charges, so there is really
nothing for the legislature to “in
vestigate.” •
WHY DO THEY
WEAR MASKS?
C. K. INGLER
“When an organization can’t face
the people without masks, have no
use for it.” This bit of advice, rela
tive to the Klu Klux Klan, recently
came in a letter to this office. Behold,
how great a matter a fiery cross
kindleth! How a piece of white cot
ton can blind some people's eyes!
Truly the god of Romanism has
blinded the unbelieving minds of
many Protestants so as to shut out the
glorious sunshine of Christianity and
patriotism.
If the Klan organization had been
of human origin, it would have ceased
to exist long ago; but somehow it is
thriving mightily on the milk of per
secution and making bold strides up
and down our great country, even in
frigid Alaska. Like the Hebrews of
Moses’ time, the more they are af
flicted the more they multiply and
grow.
“Masks!” It might as well be said
that the Allies should not have held
private conferences, covered their big
guns and officers’ headquarters with
underbrush, camouflaged their ships,
lived in dougouts, or fohght in
trenches. They were afraid of the
enemy and ashamed of their cause;
their should have done everything in
the open and above board.
In Old Testament times the Chil
dren of Israel had no business to pro
tect themselves from their enemies
by the use of the word “Shibboleth”
as a password. The early Christians
should not have lived in dens and
caves of the earth. When forbidden
to display the sign of the cross, they
should not have made themselves
known to each other by the sign of a
fish. The Savior of all mankind
called three of his immediate follow
ers into His inner circle; and to the
twelve disciples on one occasion He
said: “I have many things to say un
to you, but ye can not bear them
now.” The Christ must have been evil
minded, ashamed and afraid.
All this hue and din of the deceived
multitudes about the mask which has
been adopted by the “Knights of the
Invisible Empire” as part of its uni
form, is nothing compared to the se
cret plans and devices of the Roman
hierarchy to rob us of everything
good and ennobling that God in His
love ad mercy has vouchsafed unto
this glorious republic. By the char
acter of the enemy and its methods
of attack, a person or organization
should be judged.
If Protestants had been wise, a
word years ago would have been suf
ficient. But too many of them are
asleep and willingly ignorant of the
impending peril. Our country is
facing a struggle fiercer than the late
world conflict, and only now and then
can one be found who realizes the
situation.
Instead of falsely accusing and con
demning the Klan, it should be
hailed as the 20th century savior of
America’s political and religious free
dom; and every effort put forth to as
sist them in the heaven-inspired cause
which they have been called to cham
pion.
“Truth forever on the scaffold,
Wrong forever on the throne, —
Yet that scaffold sways the future,
And behind the him unknown
Standeth God within the shadows

BEATING HIS TO A FRAZZLE
The party was in progress. On*
of those outspoken brethren met his
friend and gesturing toward a cer
tain lady asked: “Whe’s that frump
over there?” The interrogated got
his worst frown ready and said:
“That’s my wife.” The gay question
er was ready. “Zatso, you ought to

Klansmen—to Church!
THAT BLAZING CROSS
All America stood amazed when
the newspapers heralded the fact
that, standing beside the other mam
moth floral tributes on the lawn of
his old home, as the body of Warren
G. Harding passed, was a beautiful
cross of red roses with a beautiful
heart of white, and on the arm the
letters K. K. K., a tribute from the
largest secret fraternity in America,
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. I
say, all America stood amazed, for
the report had gone forth that mighty
political powers would seek to pre
vent the placing of that floral offer
ing among the others on that lawn.
Hut it was placed there and there it
remained.
And now that Warren Harding has
crossed into the land where the Sun
goeth not down, it might be well to
remind America that this great
President had a very tender place in
his heart for this great American or
ganization, and on at least two occa
sions gave those who sought its
downfall by unjust methods to un
derstand that he would not join them
in so cowardly an undertaking. And
so it was fitting that, standing ma
jestically back among its fellows, this
blazing cross of red roses should bear
silent witness to his fidelity and tell
to the thousands who looked upon its
withering petals the story of the love
for and appreciation of such a man
by such an organization. And it was
fitting also that even the foes of that
organization and of those American
principles for which it triumphantly
stands today should step back, nor
dare to lay their hands upon that
cross.
Indeed, there must be a sickening
dread within the hearts of those in
fluences and forces that have con
tested every inch of ground over
which the Ku Klux Klan has come, as
they see the organization winning
first place among all the secret orders
of America and gathering like an
avalanche against every un-Ameri
can ideal that brings its blot and
stain to the pages of our swiftly mak
ing history. And that dread must be
come a panic indeed within the heart
of these forces as they realize that
the loved ones and friends of Amer
ica’s departed President count them
selves honored that this mighty mul
titude of Americans should bring
their flaming cross and plant it by
the body of their dead.
Gentlemen of the Ku Klux Klan, I
urge you to stand true to every ideal
and standard of life that is American
that you may be worthy indeed to
take your place in the leadership of
the life of this mighty Republic, to
which glorious heritage God has un
doubtedly called you. You have faced
a mighty foe, a foe that fought your
country before it fought you. You
have faced an enemy that dispises the
ideals and principles that are Ameri
can. You have fought through and
up until at last your banner is plant
ed on the hills and your blazing
cross flames afar. The nation looks
to you for a mighty revival of Ameri
canism, true and undefiled. It is
your happy heritage to defend the
ideals, for which your fathers died on
bloody battle fields. I call upon you
to stand true, to make good, to be
clean and honorable, to live lives of
recitude and humble service.
And if thus you live and thus you
forge forward, your blazing cross
shall light the way for mighty men of
leadership within this Republic and
you shall hold aloft their hands while
they, in the name of the Christ who
died upon that cross, leads this Re
public foiward to victory. And when
their forms shall lie within the dust
from whence they came, your blood
red roses shall wither on the mound
that marks their sleeping place and
America shall lift its hat as it passes
by.
This writer has stood outside the
door of this organization and has
prayed that God would lead it to the
hilltops of a mighty opportunity for
service. Undoubtedly, God has led.
Your multitudes have gathered from
sea to sea. Your hosts are marching
from shore to shore. You number
your crusaders by the hundreds of
thousands. God help you to serve, to
bless, to benefit, to build up, to
achieve and to battle ever for our na-,
tion’s salvation from those insidious
forces that seek to suck the very life
blood from her heart. —Bob Shuler.

SHADES OF NELSON! THIS IS
FAIRNESS
Colonel Nelson, who used to dictate
the policies of the Kansas City Star,
made a great newspaper out of it in
his day because he demanded that its
columns be kept strictly accurate and
its editorials fair to everyone.
The Colonel would have turned
over in his grave on August 25, lapt,
if he had been able to read the fol
lowing eminently “fair” quotation
from the sheet which he founded:
“Down South the Klanners never
let their 100 per cent Americanism
get far below par. The minute they
see it drop a point or two they ride
out and catch o minister’s wife and
give her a flogging,”
The Kait&s City Star at present
is suffering from fatty degeneration
of the business office, caused by the
fact that its editorials are written on
a cash register.
HOW THE KLAN CAN BE MADE A TRUE CIVIC
ASSET IN EVERY PROGRESSIVE COMMUNITY
An actively functioning Klan is
the greatest asset of which any
American city, town or village can
boast today.
The Klan in its civic operations
should prove itself a veritable driv
ing power for the good and should
typify the ideals of the God-fearing
home-loving citizens who reside in
every American community.
There is not a Klan in the United
States which should sit idle with the
excuse that there is nothing for its
membership to do. Klansmen in
every American settlement, be it
great manufacturing metropolis in
the North or humble Southern ham
let need only look around them and
they can see on every side tasks
worthy of their self-sacrifice and de
votion.
This does not mean that it is the
duty of the Klan to pry into other
people’s business, to meddle with pri
vate affairs with which they have
nothing to do. It means that the
work of the Klan in every community
should be for the public weal. The
efforts of every Klan should be to
make their city a better place in
which to live and in which the com
ing generations of Americans shall
be raised.
Fostering Education
The opportunities for a Klansman
to serve his fellow citizens are count
less. Keeping a watchful eye on the
public school system for instance.
I have before me a newspaper ar
ticle concerning the work of the Klan
in effecting the passage of a large
bond issue for the public schools in
a great city in the state of Alabama.
The city was sadly in need of new
schools, yet a certain element boldly
fought the bonds, caring nothing for
the welfare of the boys and girls who
in a generation will control the des
tines of the municipality.
And then the Klan, swung inte the
fight. They spoke for the bond issue,
showing how imperative it was to
make education a paramount civic
project. They urged their friends to
support the bonds and every Klans
man went to the polls and voted for
them.
As a result the bond issue carried
by a good majority and city officials
through the columns of reluctant
newspapers praised the Klan for its
splendid work.
It is actions such as this which
make the Klan a civic asset.
Already the leaven of the Klan is
making itself felt in many American
Cities. In, municipalities which an
past years have been either honey
combed with administrative graft or
whose treasuries have been depleted
by political extravagance slowly but
surely the campaign of the Klan for
good government has made itself felt.
Incompetents have been ousted from
office through the force of public opin
ion generated by the Klan. Men of
high ideals, loyal Americans, devoted
citizens have been prevailed upon to
accept governmental honors at a
sacrifice to themselves. Better gov
ernment has come to many towns and
cities, and is coming to many more,
thanks to the activity of the Klan.
Klan Not In Politics
Mind you, by this it is not to be
understood that the Klan is in politics.
It is neither Democratic nor Repub
lican. It favors the man —not the
party. The Klan teaches that the
rights of American citizenship should
be exercised to the fullest degree by
all loyal Americans so that foreign
and un-American influences shall not
control the destinies and sap the loyal
ty of this nation. And one of the
primary rights of citizenship is ful
filled at the ballot box. The Klan in
every city stands adamantly for good
government.
The Klan teaches also that Ameri
can citizens should not shirk their
duties incumbent upon them and im
bues its membership with true civic
pride. Since the Klan has come to
America there is less jury dodging on
the part of American citizens. The
Klansman is taught that the call to
jury service is as sacred as a call to
arms in. defense of his beloved Amer
ica. For years the judiciary of the
United States has lamented the eva
sion of jury service by loyal but
thoughtless Americans. The excuses
and evasions of good men have per
mitted professional jurors to acquit
criminals in many cases where power
ful outside influences were active in
their behalf. Nowi with Klansmen
refusing to make technical excuses
to avoid service, criminals are being
sent to jail with astonishing regular
ity in cities where the Klan member
ship is relatively strong. It is inter
esting to note that the country over
the attorneys seeking to secure the
acquittal of crooks, bootleggers, dope
sellers and this class of cattle use
every trick and exercise every chal
lenge to exclude a man suspected of
membership in the Klan from a jury
while conscientious states’ attorneys
are glad to have them, knowing that
Klansmen are lever-headed, honest
American citizens sworn to do their
duty and enforce the law.
Aids Law Enforcement
The Klan is also civic asset in the
cause of law enforcement. Klanamen
are sworn net only to obey the laws
themselves but also to aid the con
stituted authorities in enforcing them.
Many a bootlegger and illict narcotic
dealer, many a trafficker in the shame
of womanhood, many a vagrant loafer
and thief has met his downfall direct
ly owing to information lodged with
the proper authorities by Klansmen.
Klansmen by thus aiding the officers
of the law are making their home
cities happier, safer, brighter and
cleaner places in which American
women and children may live. Should
officers of the law be loath to do their
duty, Klansmen, working on public
sentiment, are able to make them
take action.
Another civic betterment directly
attributable to the Klan is a general
and nation-wide revival of militant
Protestantism. While a man may be
a Klansman without attending any
church, yet Klansmen are taught that
they become much better Klansmen if
they attend divine services regularly
with their wives and families and sup
port the Sunday Schools of their city.
As a result, church attendance has
noticeably increased, especially
amongst the male citizenship, in com
munities where the Klan is flourish
ing and is a growing power for tho
good.
The Klan is composed of no one
creed of the Protestant faith. Pres
byterians, Baptists, Episcopalians,
Methodists and many other branches
of the Protestant church rub elbows
at its meetings form lasting friend
ship and gain a strong admiration for
each other as they work in a common
and holy cause. As the result of this
co-mingling in many cities the Protes
tant congregations have united on oc
casion in great Union Protestant
services held alternately at various
churches. This means that a forward
stride has been made for a United
Protestantism which will present a
solid front to those who would engen
der ill feeling among Protestants and
weaken their church organizations for
the benefit of the un-Christian and
un-American forces who are constant
ly on the alert to rend and prey.
There are scores, yes hundreds, of
other ways in which the Klan is prov
ing itself of value to the cities and
towns where loyal Americans are
banded together in America’s cause.
Protestant Institutions
All over the country the Klans are
unselfishly giving their funds to con
struct Protestant institutions. In
Louisiana a girls’ home is being built,
a children’s home is being construct
ed in Oregon, great Klan hospitals
are being built in Texas, Arkansas
and Kansas. In my own city a
$75,000 home for orphan babies has
been built by the Klan. Surely these
great institutions are a benefit not
only to the city boasting them but to
the nation as well.
Almost every Klan in the coTEdfry
performs couatlese deeds of helpful
nature in behalf of fellow citizens
regardless of race, color or creed.
Never has a request for aid from any
worthy person or enterprise fallen on
deaf ears when presented to any Klan.
The enemies of the Klan say that the
news of donations to ministers, Prot
estant institutions and worthy enter
prises and individuals which some
times find their way into the public
press are actions merely for adver
tisement. I tell you that not one hun
dredth of the charitable work of the
Klan is ever advertised. The Klans
of America give away a million dol
lars a year to better conditions in
their various communities about which
nothing is ever said and nothing is
ever known outside of the Klavern
walls. This is a conservative esti
mate.
Summing up in brief the value of
the Klan to the American community
it may be brought to mind that this
order is composed of only the tried,
loyal and true American citizenship
sworn to uphold the highest ideals.
With such a membership and with
such aims the Klan cannot fail to be
of vast benefit to the citizenship as a
whole.
MINNEAPOLIS
LIQUOR AND VICE POLICE
ACTIVITIES
The Minneapolis police vice squad
is credited with 281 arrests for the
month of July, 1923, a very com
mendable showing indeed, but it is
to be regretted that these arrests
seem to have been almost, if not en
tirely, confined to petty offenders
rather than to the rounding up of
some of the really important prohibi
tion, vice and gambling law violators.
If the law enforcement depart
ments of all classes would concen
trate in good faith for just one month
on securing evidence against, arrest
ing and convicting some of the really
way-up criminals, they would put
more of the fear of God and the Law
into the hearts of law violators of all
kinds than would any five years of
chasing the tiddledy winks type.
Bringing to justice the big fellows
of crime, of course, would not clean
up all criminality, but it would* put
most if it out of business. The les
ser type of criminals cannot long ex
ist to any extent without the backing
and material assistance of the power
ful and influential crooks in high
places. Go after and get the small
fry by all means when they can be
picked up without too much trouble,
but bait the police hooks for the big
ones and fish for them until they ere
caught.—National Observer.
