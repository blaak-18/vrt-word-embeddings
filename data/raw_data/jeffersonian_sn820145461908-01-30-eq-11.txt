Dear Sir: Enclosed find $2, for which
please continue your weekly and send me
your monthly Jeffersonian. I have never sub

the news stand.
I would like very much to know what you
think of the action of the recent St. Louis
conference, and what will be the outcome of
the convention called by it to meet in April
next. Do you think that other reform ele
ments will join us to any considerable extent?
I should be very much pleased to learn pre
cisely your views in reference to the matter.
Yours truly,

Dear Sir: Enclosed please find two dol

two Jeffersonians. I am here in darkest
Egypt, but as I was born nearly 72 years ago

want the light and love to hear the grand old
doctrine preached in your papers. The na
tional bankers and rum sellers, twin relics of
barbarism, have about destroyed the Ameri
can republic, but let us hope through God’s
mercy the people will see before it is too late
and that our country will phenix-like arise
from her ashes and shine once more a grand,
free country. Yours for liberty and freedom,
E. M. ELDRIDGE.
