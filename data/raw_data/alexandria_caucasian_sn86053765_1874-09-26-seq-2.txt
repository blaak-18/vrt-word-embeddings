"Make Haste Slowly ".—Tli is
ig a latin maxim expressed in the
words featina lente, the wisdom of
which we commend to the careful
consideration of certain persons in
this parish, and in tbe ranks of the
White Man's Party. This, gentle
men, is a political party with cer
tain principles to advocate, with a
record to make for pood or evil and
with a most aolemu duty to perform,
which is no less than to redeem
Louisiana from the bonds of politi
cal vassalage abroad and internal
mismanagement and paralizatiou.
Its principles need not that they
ahould be baptised in blood or that
they should be proclaimed in a law
less and disorderly manner.
Its record must be not that it
nought to do away with all law, but
that it desired only to supplant bad
laws with good ones. A bad law
is much preferable to no law at all.
In the performance of its duty it
cannot afford to be hampered with
any extraordinary proceedings nor
•on it perform its duty if in addi
tion to the burden of its fight with
Radicalism it bas to carry the load
*»f blunders or acts of violence by
its partisans. Be quiet. Be active
t»nd vigilant, but "make haste slow
ly" towards disturbances of any
kind.
William Hustmybe .—Our po
bte and obliging friend "Billy"
at the old Staad of Jacob Walker
<<u Front Street, has a new and
varied slock of Dry Goods, Grocer
ies, Hardware &e., which he is pre
pared to sell cheap for cash, or to
exchange for cotton at the highest
market prices. Purchasers in search
<»t a place where they cau find tbe
vesy best of every thing, will do
trell to give him a rail.
A&AIN THE VICTIM. -
Poor Louisiana! bereister States
can shake off the shackles that
bind them to degradation and ruin,
but for herthei e is no recovery from
the living death under which she
writhes. Like Prometheus, bound
to the rock of despair she has vul
tures feeding upon her vitals, and
when in her might and the majesty
ot lier right as a sovereign State,
she rises and shakes them off, forth
with and without waiting for the
lapse of the five days allowed her
in which to breathe tbe air of free
dom, Jnpiter Olympus nods and
the vultures and harpies rush back
to the prey.*
Texas can depose a Governor
who like Kellogg claimed to have
been elected for four years, at the
eud of two, and the United States
troops are held off and permit her
to redeem herself. Arkansas can
get up a war of factions for the
possession of tbe State government,
both sides arm, drill and manouvre
with "all the pomp and circum
stance of war," and yet again the
troops are held off and Arkansas is
free.
Vicksburg can get up a war over
the election of its municipal gov
ernment, both sides rush to arms,
a conflict is imminent, appeals are
made to the President, and still
again there is no interference and
Yicksburg elects a white ticket.—
In all thiee of these cases requisi
tions were made by the recognised
Governors of the respective States
upon the President for troops and
he refused to send them. Now see
the difference. . Six men who had
incited a negro riot at Coushatta,
in Louisiana, were killed and then
goes up a howl the like of which
was never before heard. Kellogg,
the vilest Usurper and most arro
gant coward that ever disgraced
civilization, hiding his head under
the protecting wing of the troops
who were marching to put down
the "new rebellion in Louisiana^
orders his armed cohorts called "po
lice" tor politeness only, to seize the
private arms of citizens and when
they goaded to desperation, resist
and in six short honrs hurl the Usur
per and every vestige of his govern
ment in Louisiana from power, no
such moderation is shown by the
President. In indecent haste, with
out waiting to be informed, lie hur
ries to the rescue of his political
pets and again Louisiana is placed
in the bands of a government which
has no strength at homo and com
mands no respect abroad. Tbe
State government of which McEnery
was the head, was de facto in every
sense ot the terra. All the machin
ery of the government was in per
fect operation throughout the whole
State, the people both white and
black were jubilant and Louisiana
was preparing to enter upon the
road to peace, plenty and prosperi
ty, when by the strong arm of the
military force of the Unitejl States
its rightful officers were thrust out
of position and the Usurpation
again set up in its stead. There
is no way under the Constitution
by which the President can meddle
at all with the condition of affairs
at the time he interfered. There
was no armed resistance to any
thing or anybody in the State, and
if there had been, he could not un
der the Ku-Klux Act of Congress
use the military until he had given
notice, and then be can only de
clare Martial Law. The Military
Dictator of these once free States
cares but little for right or law.—
His will is law and to support his
party is the only right he recog
nizes.
We are confident that some good
will come of our herfc efforts to
tree Louisiana, and we think that
the fates must at some time assist
a people who have both the will
and the courage to lie free. Despo
tism in Louisiana to day may be
Usurpation in Ohio to-morrow, and
the revolution of last week in Lou
isiana may at no distant day be sup
plemented by one powertnl enough
to hurl the Dictator himself from
his throne. The Commune and La
Yendee may find a home in Ameri
ca and Grant may yet meet tbe fate
of Louis XVI or Napoleon. Both
the Napoleons played with crown»
and lost their own. Grant plays
to-day with State governments and
Stay yet lose the government which
in « Kingdom in all but in name.—
Louisiana is the victim to-day, be
fore long she may be the conqueror.
We mistake the temper of the
American people if they permit
such flagrant ontrages upon the
rights of a sovereign State to pass
nnnoticed.and unpunished.
The Bevolution.—Its Lessons.
The complete overthrow of tbe
Kellogg usurpation and the ready in
stallation in its stead of the rightful
government of Louisiana, although it
is overthrown by tbe military force
of the United States, will not be al
together fruitless and is not without
its lessons. It teaches Kellogg that
his government is one of straw that
can be blown out of existence by the
first breath of popular indignation.—
It proves to him, if he ever bad any
doubts on the subject, that he can
only sustain himself with the aid of
United States troops, and will per
haps make him more careful in the
future. It will, doubtless, induce him
to abandon the policy of fraud by
which he was calculating to cheat us
out of tbe victory at the polls which
awaits us in November, as it must
hare satisfied him that sncb a policy
cannot win in the face of a united
and determined people.
The lesson it brings to ns is the as
surance now made "doubly 8 lire"
that we can drive out the usurping
government at any moirent we
please, but that the Dictator who
holds his throne at Washington and
bis Court at Long Branch is deter
mined that Kellogg shall not be
driven out and that it is useless for
us to make the attempt unless we are
prepared to fight United States sol
diers. It teaches us also that "the
public sentiment North" upon which
we have relied tor so much, is in our
favor only when we quietly submit to
«very outrage heaped upon ns and is
against us whenever we refuse to
submit. The "sentiment" spoken of
pretends to condemn the Kellogg
usurpation, but such sympathy tbAt
never does anything for us and al
ways refuses to help us is worth but
precious little to us and bad better
be against than for ns. We appeal
ed to Congress and the "Northern
sentiment" could have forced that
tribunal to grant ub relief. Tbe sen
timent was quiescent and we got no
relief. We appealed to the courts of
the State and United States and
again the sentiment did ns no good.
We have now appealed to the only
tribnnal left us, that of arms, and tbe
sentiment is against us. D—n the
sentiment North or South or East or
West say we I Let ns now go cour
ageously to work relying on our own
strength and appealing only to tbe
God of right and justice, and work
out our own salvation. The way is
plain and easy. Let us get out, force
out and drag out, it necessary all our
voters and do as we can do, poll
such a rousing vote against Kellogg
and the Usurpation, as that even
Grant will have to respect the wil; of
the people so clearly expressed. Let
us now to work and let us hear no
more of supineness and indifference.
The victory is ours if we will but
grasp it !
Capt. John Hienn .—From his
card in its appropriate place, it will
be seen that our old time friend,
Captain Johu Hienn is now in the
Grand Ecore trade with the Belle
Rowland. His many friends, and
who is not Captain Hienn's friend f
will exteud to hiin a hearty wel
come.
The Capta'n informs us that just
as soon as the stage of the water
permits, he will bring in a fine side
wheel steamboat which will please
every body. Tbe old Commodore
must feel considerably like Mac
Gregor did, now that he has bis foot
again upon his native heath—deck
we should say.
In another place will also be seen
the notioe ot the organization of
the People's New Orleans and
Grand Eoore Packet Company.—
The character of the officers is a
quarauty of tbe success of the Com
pany. We wish our old frieud suc
cess and happiness.
BP* Raining as we go to preis.
THE CAMPAIGN.
The recent glorious effort of the
people of Louisiana to shake off tbe
Usurpation, which failed only be
cause of the interposition of the mil
itary force of the United States,
ought not to discouage, but rather to
animate onr people to renewed deter
mination to succeed at the ballot box
in doing what we could not do by an
armed revolution. Tbe question that
will be presented by tbe election will
be a different one from that just de
cided by President Grant and will be
one in which he will not so readily
intermeddle. We can not by the
election put Kellogg out of the Gov
ernor's Office now twice usurped by
bim, but if we elect our House of
Representatives and State Treasurer,
and get control of tbe parish govern
ments, be will find himself but a Gov
ernor in name, powerless to do us
any harm. He can not run'his gov
ernment without money and we will
have possession of tbe parts of the
government which supply and con
trol the State finances. This is tbe
most that we can expect under the
determination of the United States
government to sustain Kellogg at all
hazards, unless the new Congress
when it assembles should decide the
de jure claims now pending before
it, in our favor.
Let us not depend upon help from
Congress or anywhere else, but re
solve to help ourselves. We can car
ry this election if all our people will
but register and vote, and let us now
go to work with redoubled energy and
tsee that in Rapides every man does
register and vote. There is an an
cient maxim coming to ns from the
days of mythology that "the Gods
help them who help themselves." Let
ns be guided by its wisdom and rely
upon ourselves alone and then we
will know exactly what we have to
expect and will find no disappoint
ment in store for us. We are now
in I he very midst of the canvass in
this parish which is being eondue'ed
energetically and gives us a confident
hope that every man in the parish
will register aud vote. This is all
that i8 needed for cur success in this
parish. A fair registration which we
are having, and a fair election which
is aheadv guaranteed by tbe ai range
ments made, is all we ask or need.—
Let the campaign then from this oui
be conducte I in a peaceable but en
ergetic manner, and let no act of vio
lence or disorder furnish onr enemies
with a pretext to throw out the vote
of this parish and all will be well.

The F aib A ssociation .—Grant
has overturned tbe legal govern
ment of the State, but has magnan
imously consented to allow the Ra
pides Agricultural Fair Associa
tion to go on with their exhibition.
We are happy to sta r e autlioritive
ly that there has beeu no interrup
tion to tbe work of preparation for
tbe Fair which opens on the 19th ot
October, and that every arrange
ment which will add to the comfort
and convenience of visitors aud ex
hibitors is now being rapidly made.
The exhibition this year will be a
grand success alike creditable to
tbe Association and the Parish.
Such enterprises should be en
couraged by all our citizens, and
any having any article no matter
how small of merit, beauty or curi
osity, should take it to the Fair for
exhibition.
|y We desire to call particular
attention to the card which appears
this morning of Mr. P. H. Oswald,
who has leased the brick store bouse
of Mrs. M. L. Grogan, on the Bayou
Robert Road, and has just opened
a new aud fresh stock of goods,
which he offers to sell cheap for
cash or exchange for cotton. The
stock of Mr. Oswald is well select
ed, is varied aud just suited to
please tbe taste of all those who
desire the very best articles at a
small profit over cost. Purchasers
will do well to give bim a call, for
as be is himself a Planter as well as
Merchant, he understands their
wants, and knows how to provide
for them. _
We publish this morning and
will contiuue to do so during tbe
business season, tbe latest market
quotations in New Orleans. This
will doubtless be an accommoda
tion to onr readers and particular
lv to our merchants.

The Rapides Cemetery Asso
ci ATioN. —This Association bas just
had a new aud substantial picket
fence put around tbe whole of the
old Pineville Cemetery, have had
I all tbe underbrush cut out, have
employed a Sexton, and are now
I preparing to lay off the walks, and
(otherwise improve aud beautify tbe
j grounds. They have done all this
I at a small cost, but as it fell upon
tbe shoulders ot but few, it was se
riously felt. They now desire to
build a cottage tor the Sexton
which they cau do for a compara
tively small sum. This is an enter
prise in which nearly, if not quite,
all our people are interested and
they should do something now that
they are about to be in funds, to
cucourage aud support it. The
shares of tbe stock are $5.00 only ;
let every body who has not done bo,
take at least one share, and let
those who have not done so, pay up
the one half, which has been called
for of what they have subscribed.
A New Paper .—A iriend sends
us the first number of" T he H al

A note to us says that it proposes
to fight for Louisiana as they have
no fight of their own. Happy
Texas ! We welcome the News
in to the brothernood of which we
are ourselves, but a new member,
and gladly accept its offer of assis

T he C rops .—Tbe crops in Ka>
pides are made aud we sum up the
result iromthe best information
we can gather. We have made
about two thirds of a cotton crop,
which is being rapidly picked, baled
and shipped. We will make very
nearly a lull crop of Sugar. Our
owu observation ot nearly all the
ci/be fields leads us to believe that
this will be the best cane crop
made since the war. We have
made and it is now pretty generally
housed, corn enough to do the par
ish auother year, but with little to
spare.
iy Capt. H. C. Ripley and O. D.
Parmley United States Engineers
are here surveying tbe falls aud up
per portion of tbe town to ascertain
the eost of erecting such works as
will best protect Alexandria from
tbe force of the current which is fast
washing it away. This is in re
spouse to a petition sent on to Con
gress at its last session. An appro
priation was made for the survey
and we presume that at its next
session Congress will make an ap
propriation to complete the work.
The ready response to our petition
is gratifying.
ty We clip tbe following well
merited compliment to two of our
gallaut Kapides boys from the New
Orleans Bulletin :
David Stafford aud Thomas
Spence Smith, although not citi
zens ot this city, may now return
to their homes, in Rapides, with
the full conviction that their bra
very and courage in action has
brought to thein its own reward iu
tbe redemption ot tbe State. At
tached to the commands that were
actively engaged in fighting the
metropolitans, these gentlemen
were a fair sample of what stuff tbe
country boys are made of. Long
may they wave !
