SUPPLY BILL PASSIE
The Measure Goes Through the
House With Little Debate.
A RECORD BREAKER.
The Act Involves the Expenditure eof
$2t,486,808-War Revenue Will
Not Be Reduced Mere Than `
$40,000,000 Now.
Washington' Dec. 12.--Tbe first of the
great supply bills, legislative, executive
and judicial, was passed by the house
Monday in record time. The bill car
vies $24,496,1108 and has 131 pages, but
there wan less than 10 minutes debate
upon it. No other business was trans
acted.
The day under the roles of the house
belonged to the District of Columbia
committee, but owing to the desire of
the leaders to proceed with the legislat
ive, exeontive and judicial appropriation
bill, district day was postponed for a
week. The legislative bill was immedi
stely taken up. Mr. Bipgham of Penn
sylvania, who was in charge of the
measure, made a preliminary statement
of its contents,.after which there being
no desire to speak from either side of the
house, general debate was closed and
the roll was read for amendments under
the 5-minute rule.
Both parties in the recent campaign,
Mr. Bingham said, pledged themselves
to economy and retrenchment. Tie
pending bill, the first of the big moneta
ry bills, wasa step in that direction.
Mr. Robinson of Indiana said if re
- trenchment was desired a provision
a should have been inserted in tde bill to
out off the 30-days' sick leave in addi
tion to the 80 days leave now allowed to
olerks in the eseoutive departmeutsa
Mr. Bingham said that snuch legisla.
tion did not come within the public
revenue bill and that the subjeot of
leaves are in the hands of various hesds
of the departmenkt.
Yr. Robinson declared that clerks ia
the government service, outside of the
eIecutive departments, did not receive
tbs leave of abcasee and he did not
think it just to d1sorimidate.
An amendment providing for 12 addi
tional temporary clerks to dispose of the
acoamulated business in the offioe of the
comptroller of the tremsery was adopted.
At the oonoteson of the reading of
the bill, which aonsisted of 1l pages,
SMr. Blagham thanked the house for the
eonfdenee daows in te appropratios
eosmittee for allowing the bill to go
through unchanged and then the bill

REPORTS CONFLICT.
f Railway Officials Say Trafc Is Ioviag
About as Usual and Telegraph
era Assert That the Kead Is
In a Bad Vay.
e Hotton, Dec. 12 -There is not the
e slightest indication of a settlement of
e the telegraphers' strike. The reports
that emanate from the Order of Railway
*t Telegraphers' headquarters and those
e coming from the general offices of the
s. reports differ materially. The men re
port that the strike has proven an un
e qualified sucoess and the company
a represents that it has turned rut to be
, a complete fizzle. There is not the
"' slightest indication of a weakness on
n either side and no show of a compro
a mise being made.
Reports are being circulated at the
Order of Railway Teleraphers' head
e quarters, and with them it seems to be
t a question of time until the offlotals of
g the road will realise that their business
e cannot be conducted without members
d of the Order of Railway Telegraphers
r and that the tie up and loss of revenue
resulting therefrom will bring the oom
t, pany to terms.
n The attitude of the Santa Fe is exact
y as has been from the the beginning.
. It is announced as the intention of the
company to continue filling the places of
,. the strikers, which it claims is able to
n do, and provide the new men with ade
: quate protection from violeane where
i. the conditions indicate 'they are in dea
a ger of personal injury.
It is therefore the intention on its
- psrt to fight to the finish. The prepara
tions have been made with that end in
4 view and there is as yet no reason to
V doubt that it will waver from its par
pose
