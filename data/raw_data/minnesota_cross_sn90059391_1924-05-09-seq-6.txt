Churches Call Klan*s
Gifts * Cheap Publicity 9
BUCKHANNON, W. VA., May 3.
Does the Ku Klux Klan need public
ity? If so, from what source does it
get it?
Those two pertinent questions are
faat fleeting through the brains of
fair-minded Upshur county citizens
following the colossal failure of an
anti-Klan press agent to discredit the
great patriotic organization.
Easter Sunday, Buckhannon Klan,
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. made
liberal donations to every church in
Buckhannon and its vicinity. Every
church returned the money with the
exception of the Buckhannon Baptist
church. The. Rev. W. H. Barlow, pas
tor of the church, took the matter up
with his congregation, and it was vot
ed to accept the money and extend
the thanks of the church.
Those who returned the money were
negro Methodists, prejudiced caucae
ien United Brethren, Presbyterians,
and Methodists. The United Breth
ren are members said to be reconsid
ering the matter of accepting the
money. The super-eminent church of
ficials objected to accepting the gift
on account of it was “a cheap adver
tising scheme of the Klan," it is un
derstood.
With this, a local correspondent for
the Clarksburg Exponent, who be
came notorious in this backwoods
county for propaganda sent out
against the Klan, immediately mailed
his paper a story delineating the fact
that the “cheap Klan advertising
trick had been foiled.
In his story the enthusiastic cor
respondent failed to relate, however,
that the Klan did not make a public
appearance in Buckhannon when the
gifts were made. The correspondent
also omitted the fact that the gifts
were unostentatiously placed on col
lection plates when the regular Sun
day offering was taken, and that they
were sealed in plain envelopes. With
each Klan offering was a communi
cation setting forth its desire to en
courage agencies of the Protestant re
ligion—no advertising, just plain
praise for the church.
As Buckhannon is situated on a
branch railroad in an isolated county
and does not support a daily paper
just why would the Ku Klux Klan,
an organization of international fame,
go to a place of that sort to pull a
publicity stunt? Each of the Klan
offerings contained from 326.00 to
$60.00. There was no ceremony in
presenting the money, and it was
placed on the collection plates in
plain envelopes. Fair minded per
sons are at a loss to know just how
the dilettante reporter fathoms that
the Klan offerings was “a cheap pub
licity stunt.”
Buckhannon Klan has gone over the
top in membership and is now a char
tered organization. When a Klan
Sets a charter it is then supposedto
e through taking in members. Jje
Klan is not depedennt on church offi
cials —but church officials are de
pendent on Klansmen.

should stop giving individual aid to
the various religious institutions in
this state, half of the churches in
West Virginia would close their doors
before the expiration of six months.
However, it is hoped that Klansmen
will be too broad minded to cease
their contributions to religious in
stitutions on account of a handful of
bigots in the back county of Upshur.
The Ku Klux Klan does not need
publicity, especially the kind where
a church would have to be brought
into a propaganda scheme. Today,
people are thundering at the doors of
the Klan for admission —“cheap ad
vertising” is not needed. There was
a time when the Klan needed public
ity. It got it, and it didn’t pay for it.
The organized opposition furnished
the publicity with knocks which, in
each instance, proved to be a one
hundred per cent boost.
The Ku Klux Klan does not main
tain a publicity staff, but relies upon
antagonistic newspapers. The arti
cles written by tne Exponent’s cor
respondent which were subsequently
expesed, are the most successful
forms of Klan publicity.
What About America?
(From Duluth News Tribune)
All but two of the 22 New York
congressmen have united in a pro
test to congress against the immigra
tion bill that has been reported to
the house by the committee. They
protest that it is unjust to foreign
ers.
But what about a little justice to
Americans?
Nobody should longer question
America’s right to limit and select
her immigrants. Immigration is a
peaceful invasion of America. If our
immigrants are in sufficient numbers
and of a type that is not easily assim
ilated by the republic they are a men
ace to our form of government and
our living standards and surely Amer
ica has every right to protect herself
against the invasion.
More than 160 years ago our fore
fathers launched the greatest experi
ment in government the world had
ever seen. They founded a republic
based on the principles of represen
tative self government. It is our
right and our duty to protect that
republic by shutting the gates against
those who have neither the desire
nor the faculty of self-government.
If such persons are coming to our
shores in sufficient numbers to threat
en our institutions, surely we have a
right to put up the bars.
There are millions of Europeans
who look upon America as the prom
ised land. But this nation cannot ab
sorb them without lowering the liv
ing standards of its own people, and
without endangering the very insti
tutions that have kept American liv
ing standards higher than those of
other countries. To admit this flood
of immigrants would not improve
conditions in other countries, but it
would materially lower living stand
ards here.
Surely, under those conditions,
America has a right to limit immi
gration and to select the immigrants
she will admit. And surely congress
should not be concerned about the ef
fect on “foreigners” so much as they
are concerned about the effect on
America.
Unforunately, however, immigra
tion is likely to be considered on po
litical grounds and not on social or
economic grounds. Many representa
tives are likely to think of the racial
pride of certain big groups of vot
ers, and this factor, combined with
the influence of those who want
“cheap labor” may have sufficient
weight to prevent the adoption of a
sane and permanent immigration
during this crazy session of a muck
raking congress.

Joasb, viewed In the light of his an
cestor* was a poor prospect for a
king. IDs grandmother was the
wicked Athallah and his great grand
parents were Ahab and Jezebel. There
was enough bad blood in hla veins to
assure his doom. Despite this fact, be
brought about some noble reforms and
turned the people back to God.
I. Athallah Usurps ths Throne.
(vt. 1-3).
L Her Attempt t# Destroy the Seed
Royal (v. 1). In order to remove any
rightful claimant to the throne she
tried to kill all the royal male chil
dren. The act was not of sudden Im
pulse, but of deliberate purpose
2. Joasb Preserved by Jebosheba
(w. 2. 3). Though Athallah was keen
eyed, she was checkmated by another
woman. This woman, the wife of the
priest, stole away this child and hid
him away In a bedchamber for six
years. God had promised that through
the Dayldlc line the Messiah should
come. In order that this line be un
broken Joash must be preserved. No
purpose of God can fall.
11. Jeash Crowned King (rv. 4-12).
L Jeholada’s Preparations (rv. 4-
11). The high priest and hla wife
were strong characters. As the high
priest, Jehoiada felt that It was hla
duty to thwart the heathen project of
Athallah. Hla wife’s co-operation
made possible the saving of Joash.
(1) Seeks the aid of the military lead
ers (v. 4). He knew somehow that
these men were not loyal to Ath
all ah.
(2) He took an oath of them In the
house of the Lord (▼. 4). He bound
them to their agreement by every avail
able means.
(3) He Incited their spirit of pa
triotism (v. 4). He gave them a sight
of the king’s son. This, no doubt, was
a great surprise. Now, having seen
the heir to the throne, they would risk
everything, even their Uvea, In order
to set him on the throne.
(4) He ce-ordlnates all matters
(vt, P-11). The soldiers were divided
late companies and arms were dis
tributed to them. Each group was as
signed to spedlc duties.
2. The Coronation (▼. 12).
(1) The king's son brought forth.
This was a great day In Jerusalem.
(2) Put the crown upon him. This
was the formal Induction Into office.
(8) Gave him the testimony. This
was a copy of the law Indicating that
the king was to rule according to the
law of God. The act of putting the
law on bis head showed that the king
himself would be tinder control of the
law.
(4) Mai# him king. This shows that
he had been mads king by the choice
of the people.
(5) Anointed him. They poured oil
upon his heed. This was the usual
method of consecrating prophets,
priests and kings.
(6) Clapped their bands. This was
a token of Joy. The deed being done,
they were ready to publicly proclaim
It They shouted “Long live the king.”
111. Althallah Slain (vv. 18-17).
L The Noise of the Coronation of
Joash Brought Athaliab to the Temple
(t. 15). Up to this time she thought
her place ea fee throne was secure
and that her heathen religion had free
course.
2. Her Doom (v. 14). Upon her ar
rival at the temple she saw the king
wearing the crown and surrounded by
guards so that she could do nothing.
In her despair she exclaimed “Trea
son, treason." This was not treason,
but the triumph of right over wrong—
the defeat of conspiracy and plot
ting.
8. Athaliab Executed (w. 15, 16).
The orders were that she should not
be killed In the temple. They led her
out by the way of the horses* entrance
to the king's palace and slew her.
What a tragic end for the sinner. Sin
can only prosper for a time.
IV. Werahlp of the People (vv.
17, 18).
Joash was seven years old when he
was made king The high priest made
a covenant between the Lord, the king
and the people that they would be the
Lord’s people. In carrying out this
covenant they broke down the temple
of Baal and slew the priests of Baal.
BLANCHARD. MICH—A large au
dience filled the local theater recent

principles of the Klan. The chief
theme of the lecturer was “Christ
wants us to be real militant Chris
tians." The lecture was well re
ceived, and many made application
for membership in the order.

Louis F. Hart of Washington Will
Devote Time to Public
Education
(Scottish Rite News Bureau)
WASHINGTON, D. C., May 6.
The ignorant textbook writer and the
inaccurate school book are to face a
vigorous fight when Governor Louis
F. Hart, of Washington, gets through
in office. Governor Hart ie not a
candidate for re-election, and intends
to devote much of his time when re
lieved from the cares of office to com
bating the use of inaccurate and mis
leading textbooks.
“Some of the statements I have
found in our school books are so pre
posterous and inaccurate as to be al
most amusing,'* he says. “Neverthe
less it is a very serious thing that our
state should be so much misrepre
sented and its resources touched upon
with such carelees disregard of facts.
It is wrong, in the first place, that
the children in our schools should be
expected to depend upon such text
books; but when we remember that
the same misstatements are carried
into the schools in many other states,
we get a better appreciation of the
magnitude of such misguidance.”

(Bureau of Publication and Education?
NEW YORK, May s.—The New York
Times as well as the Hearst paper#
seems to take a delight in adverti#*
ing Eugene O'Neill’s play “All God’a
Chillun Got Wings,” representing it
as a play worth while, although to
most people it certainly smacks of
the danger line. It is high time that
the American people were waking up
to what is going on along such lines.
Think of these newspapers stooping
to the position of maxing out of
themselves a propaganda machine for
influence that would favor mixed mar
riages and mongrelize the American
race.
Are we to prostitute the American
public to where it can look with fa
vor on a white woman playing oppo*
site a negro either on the stage or on
the screen, becoming his wife and
slave and in the last scene made to
stoop to kiss the negro's hand?
No good American citizen can fa
vor that sort of rot. It's repulsive
to all decent people, including th#
negro race as well as the white race.
It’s against God’s law and man’s law
and reflects a low intelligence on the
part of all who have anything to do
with encouragement of such practice.
