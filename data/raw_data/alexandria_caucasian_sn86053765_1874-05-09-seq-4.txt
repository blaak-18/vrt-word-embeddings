On tlio Win«;, ° Mardi, 1874.—
When »«iwiHin of tho soul twitches
tlic thought, through the mind, that
a mail eau leave Now York in the
morning and get to San Francisco
at night, the mbid boils with won
der and stew« with amazement at
the thought of it, until you asc.er
taiu that you don't gei Iheio t lie
Haine night, but aoino other night.
The Shortest route from Rrooklyii

up Broadway to Forty-Second

P.M., at* the ttiru yn the ferry is
then fifty percent, less than at any

hilated yet, as I know a man who
recently applied for thirty days
space on a bill of goods and got it.
People coming to California can
wear tlu-ir regular "clothes. A few
yearaagi) you required a cylinder,
stove for an evercoaty and had to
keep the door shut or bo heard with
shot holes until you resembled the
outside skin of a nutmeg grater.

California that appear to be slewed
down in funnyncss, both kinds of
sauce. I conversed with sonic of
'em. I was on the t'ar.s, there was
a fellow in the next seat, he hadn't
had .Iris hair cut since the colit sum
mer of 1810. lie looked like a
phrenologist that had been examin
ing the head of a whiskey barrel,
and he had either been taking
drawings troltt it, or else he'd oaten
a pretty big piece of mince pie, with
an awful quantity of brandy in it.
1 introduced myself.

Says I : "What's the dijïfrener
between a dead man and a«W»rpse?"
Says he:° u Therc ain't none." ®
Sajs 1, "There aint, hey f Sup

Says I, "Stranger, that's a nice
ring."
Says lie, "Yes that's au engage

Says I, "No. Were you in the

Says-lie, No, sir. Why?"
Says 1, "1 was in an engagement

Says he, "No ; «lit! she have you ?"

we got to knowing each other as
well as though we'd been cradled
and thrashed together in infancy,
eaten spare ribs off the same car
pet tacks, or partaken of tenderloin
steaks off the same bent pins, when
we knew more about birch rods
q than stair rods. He turned out to
be a philosophera it!! a pocket com
pass travelling to the windward tor
his health. Ilo rcmarke^l, "\V s hat
a lot of gruliters there are in this
© world." ® ® ®
1 observed, "Yes, sir; especially
Cincinnati." ?
lie remarked, "No, I don't mean
hogs, 1 mean people."
I observed, "On, yes, you mean
people afflicted with lot being sat
isfied with their condition in life,
and all the time grumbling because
t hey wore'irt borne some <g,her fel

He remarked, Exactly ; the good
book says. 'Cast thy bread upon

1 observed, "I should think it
<S#uld get wet and taste doughy."
lt%}tAUKAHLE OBSERVATIONS.
Right here we changed our tac
tics; instead of remarking, he ob
served ; and I, instead oftobserving
commeuced to remark. I 9
lie observed, "The iriajoi#y of
people are just meau eiimigh to
spend their lives chucking little
hunks of bread overboard so small
you could drive a spike ot 'em
through the eye of a needle "with
out hurting the needle s head, and
then grunt and growl because those
crumbs don't get two of 'em into a
coal cart."® ® ®
1 remarked, "That's so." g
He observed, "Young man, cve
%odv should be satisfied with their
lot."
I remarked,©"Yes, sir; I'd like
one with a house on it."
He observed, "1 mean his lot in
life." _ ®
I remarked, <! So do I. I Uoa'C

He observed, "All right."
1 remarked, '-There are lots of

Lot, whose wife was a well-preserv

Ho observed, "Yes ; but remem
ber there are 1,300,000,000 people
in the world," ?
I remarked", "Including the Smiths

He observed, " Including every
body."
1 remarked, "Are you prepared
to make a small bet on that?"
He observed, "I never bet."
1 remarked, "Well, I kind
o thought, if you were prepaid! to
back up your statement that there
are 1,300,000,000 people and folks
o|i this here sphere, I'd go you the
«yïiiks that you fire at least 1-50 out
of the way." .
lie observed, "Ifoav could we
prove it?"
1 reinforced, "I'd let you count

He observed, "I was going to
lay, with such a wist number ol
people in the world, how lew—flow
very few of us would like to take
the rink of being born over again.
How slight would*l>o the chance of
being born a Victoria or a Czar, and
how fearfully great the chance
would be of oui; being born a John
Chinaman or a nigger?" ©
Says 1, "That's so. Speaking of
being born, reminds me of some
thing I have at home."
•SayS he,. "What's that?" '©
Says I, "Street music."
Says he, "What's s free t 'music
got to do with it?"
"Say«.I, "My street music is a
baby. If you should hear it yell
for its paregoric nights you'd think
it was street music- enough for one
family."
Says he, "I will observe, you are
a remarkable man."
® Says I, "I will remark", you are an
observing man."®
A MAN WITH A fiUN.
It was thus we parted. 1 spied uq
fellow with a gun standing by him
reading (flip fellow was reading not
the gun.) I dislike to fcee anybody
read too fnueh; it. hurts the eyes.
So 1 went over alut felt ol his gun.
. , , i i i i *
It had two barrels, and loaded at
the handle, and 1 was puzzled in m'y
mind to tell "whoflier to address "the
owner of y, as Mr. Buffalo JSill or
Mr. Lockport Joe. Says I, "(iot*.an
other
©•
Says he, "Yes, sir, T have a moth
er." « ©
©
Says T, "I didn't say a mother. I
said another gun."
Says ho, "No. sir."
Says I, "That gun lias $ very
large bon»e." ^ °
( | ( Says he, "It lias, but not as big a
bore as you arc."
Says I, "Going a gunning, I
guess?" ®
Says ho, "You guessed right sir."
Says I, "What you going to
hoot?" ©
Says he (not soto rçpc.) "Butter
tljes and grasshoppers, sir?"
Says I, "1 guess you got soar su
gar in yours this morning.''
1 left him and went over and
mused, and I mused about the time
I used to go a-gutining, when I
turned out in tln&Ncw Haven Grays
and Bites. 1 felt awful big in those
tjainer clothes. 1 felt then that ev
ery gal in town was iuh&ve wi||i me
and as-walked up to th© armory I
swelled with glory, and 1 do believe,
that if I had been detailed all alone
to go and fight Europe while the
rest ol the company were, thrashing
Asia it would have been rough on
Europe. In those days Terry be
longed to our company, and we
used always to go up in i'rout of the
Tontine Hotel to display and turn
around, so as t^e strangers would
see us, and know what difficulties
they woulf! labor under il they ever
attempted to take New Haven. 'Per
ry used tobe called plain Jflf.Terry,
iiow he is called BPSgadicr-Goncral
Allied II. Terry, IJ. S. A., head
quarters at St. Paul. We carried
Hint-lock muskets, and the manual
contained such orders as^open pan,
prune, sliïTt pan," &c., Tell a sev
enth regiment fellow to-day to shut
pan, he'd take it f|> mean stop con
versing, and kn^Jc you down. It
was obnoxious to go a gunning for
game in those «lays. 1 used to
start with powder enough to li!l a
<#al scuttle and send ai, ox team
on ahead with tht®wads, and when
I sighted a bird, size thirteen to the
ounce, I'd giound one end of m^r
gun .fnd pour a dipfrr full of po\V
der into leach barrel, then ram a
whole .Journal ol Commerce into one
hole, and two or three Heralds into
the other; tlieu p<f»ir in a couple of
quarts of shot, spank the barrels to
shako'em down; then put in a ream
of paper to keep £tie shot from jump
ing out; then prime, and by the
time I got ready to put the butt of
the guu against a post and fire, 1
generally found the bird had suc
cumbed to old nge and died. When
my gun went off the ®inan at the
helm always knew it, from an in
clination almost irresistible to .sit
down and attend a nose-bleeding
picnic. I have tired a whole bush
el of shot at a bird, and the bird
would dodge 'em, or if hit it would
ouly lioists its northeast leg and
JJ
wink. I oiKBc shot at a blue jay.
As 1 tired a boy stepped put from
belling the tree. I thought I'd kill
ed him, but he walked up to me—
his face looking as if lie was coming
dswn with the meahles. He scratch
ed his 'lace and remarked "that
gyats wef„e plenty," and I said "yes"
and went home. Times are chang
ed since, and so arc guns. > . .

FRONT STREET, Alexandria Louiiiana.
The Orange and the
CATHOLIC FARMS*?,
DECISION OF THE POP*.
THE ST. LOUIS GLOBE of the 10th
ult.f make* the follOwipg ' inlpor
tant aniiAuncement:
Roman Catholic fanners dësirom of
' dining the order of the patrons Of
husbandry, have hitherto had in their
way tho iawa of their obarcli, forbid
ding its members to identity them
selves with secret societies. Of our
American prelates we believe that
Archbishop . Alemanry, of San Fran
ciscli, has held that the Catholic far
mer will do well to ere on the side^ of
safety, and so uot join the grange un
til the Pope has evpressed Iiis approv
al of its objects, while other Bintiopa
have forbidden members of their flocks
from becoming patrons upon may con'
sideratiou.
The matter has been finally adjudf
cated on by Pious IX, as appears by
the Norisk Volkebl.nl, the Scandinari
an organ of Minnesota.
A Catholic member of tho Stnte Leg
islature was desirous of joining the
grange, but had conscientious sciuples
abont doing so, ansing fiom his icli
nions belief.
lie consulted Father Ireland, of St.
Paul, who refilled him tu liiahup
Grace. liuili these clergy wen ox
pressed themselves us possessing a fa
vorable impicssiou of thu principles,
objects and methods ol the griiuge, but
neither of thcin could break though tho
absolute rule of thu church, and they
recommended the legislator to appeal
to Home.
H<i accordingly laid the matter be
fore the Pope, to whom he transmitted
at thu same time lull particulars as to
the objects contemplated by the order,
and thu means by which it was pro
posed to attaiu them. ©
A reply 1 as been received from his
Holiness, .stating that tho Po|»e allows
the petition to join the Grange of
Puttotis of Husbandry, and he a mem
ber thereof, if lie lind nothing there it
conti ict with, his conscience, or tho
creed of the Catholic Church.
As a congregation, the order has
received a large accession in Minneso
ta, and when the news of the Pope's
decision has reached other States, its
effects will be largely to incrèase tho
numbers of the pat ions,'and to rcinovo
the interdict laid upon Catholics dé
sirions of becoming such, l»y prehijtes,
who have disapproved of the Grunge,
and been doubtful as the consistency
of its obligations with those of the
Church.
