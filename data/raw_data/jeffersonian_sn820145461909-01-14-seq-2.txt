THE TARIFF THIEVES AND
HOGS.
Letter to Congressman McCall from
Charles Francis Adams of 'Boston:
I see in the Boston Herald of this
morning that the President-elect, is
anxious that those who desire a re
vision of the tariff in the direction
of reduced schedules should make
themselves heard in Washington. It
is claimed that those asking that the
tariff schedules should remain as they
are, or should be changed only in the
way of increase, are much in evidence
at the hearings now in progress, and
that the tariff reformer, so-called,
does not appear, or is silent.
You, my dear Mr. McCall, know
perfectly well the reason of this.
Those first referred to are directly
and peculiarly interested; and, as
such, naturally divided into two class
es. Speaking after the fashion of
men, they are either Thieves or Hogs.
I myself belong to the former class.
I am a tariff Thief, and I have a li
cense to steal! It bears the broad
seal of the United States, and is what
is known as the “Dingley Tariff.” I
stole under it yesterday; I am steal
ing under it today; I propose to steal
under it tomorrow. The government
has forced me into this position, and
I both do and shall take full advan
tage of it. I am, therefore, a tariff
Thief —with a license to steal! And
—what are you going to do about it?
The other class come under the
Hog category; that is, they rush
squealing and struggling to the great
Washington Protection Trough, and,
with all four feet in it, they proceed
to gobble the swill. Well acquainted
with those of this class, you know
their attitude and their utterances. It
is useless for me to dilate upon either.
To this class I do not belong. I am
simply a tariff Thief; but, as I have
said, with a license to steal.
But, on the other hand, I am also a
tariff reformer. I would like to see
every protective schedule swept out
of existence —my own included.
Meanwhile, what inducement have I
to go to Washington on a public mis
sion of this sort? A mere citizen, I
represent no one. If I went I would
receive from the committee scarcely
a respectful hearing, if any hearing
at all; and I would have to go at a
considerable expense both of my
money and my time, the last of which
I can least afford.
My position in these respects is
exactly the position of myriads of
others. And then they say we do
not exist!
Meanwhile, I do know this. On
every occasion when of late 1 have
had .occasion to address an audience,
any reference to “Protection run
mad,” oi’ to the tariff as “the Moth
er of Trusts” has invariably elicited
a more spontaneous response than any
other utterance I could make. This
feeling is abroad, becoming stronger
and will certainly, soon or late, be in
evidence at the polls. Meanwhile, the
tens of thousands of persons who
feel in that way, like myself, cannot
afford either the time, or more fre
quently, the money, to go to Washing
ton to ask to be heard before a com
mittee which they know in advance
is both prejudiced and packed against
them.
I have in this letter set forth the
situation so far as a revision of the
tariff is concerned, as it exists within
your personal knowledge and my per
sonal knowledge. You are welcome
to make such use of it before the
committee, or elsewhere, as you see
fit.
Meanwhile, have it well understood
that my position is exactly the posi
tion of tens of thousands of others
scattered throughout the country. To
ask us to put aside our business af
fairs, and, at our own expense, go to
Washington on a desperate mission,
is asking a little too much, whether
the demand comes from the com
mittee or from President-elect.—
The Public.
HONESTY.
The Standard Oil Trust started in
1862 with $4,000 and is now worth
about $4,000,000,000. Coal Oil John
nie D. declares it was all accumulated
honestly, that no unfair advantage
was taken. Yes. A horse thief would
say the same if he got away with the
goods after a hard chase. He would
have a hard time making the people
believe him just the same as the horse
thief would have trouble to convince
the owner of the equine that it was
fair for the thief to take the horse. —

MANY A SLIP.
During the next six months or so
the really judicious politician will
keep ever in mind the fact that there
is many a slip between the pre-elec
tion promise and the post-election
postoffice.—West Baden (Ind.) Jour

BE UP TO DATE OR FAIL.
A physician tells me that he goes
through his medical library every year
and throws out a lot of books which
have become useless to him because
the new, the up-to-date, the more pro
gressive, are pushing out the old.
We all know that some of the
scientific books published are useless
a year after they appear in print.
There never was a time in the his
tory of the world when the new in
every line of endeavor crowded out
the old as it does today.
If you examine your business thor
oughly you will probably find old
fogy methods, obsolete ideas, and
cumbersome ways of doing things; a
lot of red-tape in your methods.
Remember that nothing else is im
proving faster than business meth
ods. If you are keeping books as
they were kept a quarter of a cen
tury ago, if you are using the same
business system, you will find that
you are way behind the times. —Suc-

MR. TAFT’S TRIBUTE TO DR.
HEIDT.
Dr. John W. Heidt well deserves the
unique tribute which he received from
Mr. Taft when he called upon the
president-elect, in company with the
Augusta ministers, on Tuesday last;
and the country will no doubt soon
be ringing with the praises of this
former Atlantan.
An ex-Confederate soldier, who
plighted his youthful allegiance to the
flag which rose at Sumter and which
fell at Appomattox, Dr. Heidt enjoys
the rare distinction of having given
to the United States army four gallant
sons.
Two have attained the rank of cap
tain, and have rendered signal service
in the Philippines, one is now a lieu
tenant in the service, and the fourth
is a student in the Military Academy
at West Point.

Dr. Lyman Abbott asks if anybody
can explain the mystery of life and
death. Nobody has yet, anyway, and
it has not been because of lack of
time, either.
Dr. Heidt that I am most agreeably
surprised to find that he is the father
of the sons whom I have known so
well and so favorably and who have
served their country so gallantly in
times of peril, when perhaps they dis
played as much bravery as did their
father when he wore the gray.”
It is not difficult to imagine the
well-spring of paternal pride which
gushed from the heart and reached to
the eyelids of the gentle man of God
upon hearing this golden encomium
from the great jurist who is soon to
be the president of the United States.
But the history of the whole Span
ish-American war bears eloquent tes
timony to the fact that Dr. Heidt is
only one among many thousands of ex-
Confederate veterans whose sons are
ready to follow the streaming stripes
and the blazing stars of Old. Glory

shall sound the cry “to arms.” —The
