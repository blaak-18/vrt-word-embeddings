TOO KIND TO THE HUNTER SORT
uF SOCIALISTS.
Dear Comrade: —I have read with
zest your article on “Socialism” in
the October issue.
What you said there is just what
I have been wanting to read, and, I
believe, is just what the people of
this old South would have you say.
In you I see a great lover and friend
of the South, and one who is true to
the principles of her people; al
ways ready to defend the South
and her people, ever willing to speak
out in defense of her and the
fair women and loyal, honest men
who make the laws and till the fields.
Would that we had more of your
kind, for the principles of several
hundred Tom Watsons scattered
over this fair land would soon make
the thieving politicians and the howl
ing, defeated, liberty-deserting sons
of Socialism take up their grips and
—“skiddoo!”
But you were too mild, too ready
to talk kindly, and say soft things
about Socialism and Hunter.
Had your article been written by a
Socialist, in reply to one you had
written, he would have cursed till
his face was blue, and the old South
erners who fought so bravely for
purity of politics and government
would have received a “bowling
out” that would make the sons of
Liberty drop their heads in shame.
You say, “Mr. Hunter,” or “Col.
Dick Maple,” and in speaking of them
talk of them as gentlemen, but is it
the same on the other side? No, no!
It is “Tom Watson, the rundown, de
feated, class-conscious, receiver-with
out-giving politician.”
But that is only the difference be
tween a Watson and a Hunter, or a
Maple.
My parting: Give it to ’em strong,
and the voice of the South will
echo, “Well done, good and faithful
Watson, hit ’em again.”
May your kind increase.
Wishing you all the success you
deserve, I am,
Respectfully,
JACK DUNAWAY.
Dothan, Texas.
(All right, Jack, they shall get it
hot and strong. T. E. W.)
CO-OPERATION THAT IS MUCH
APPRECIATED.
Dear Sir: —I am enclosing you $2
to cover subscriptions to your maga
zine and weekly in name of Robert
Ruffin, Como, Miss.
I have been the means by which
you have gotten many subscribers in
different parts of the country.
You are doing a noble work, and
may T. W. Watson be spared many
years. I would not be without his
paper and magazine for fifty times
the subscription. How any Southern
man can disparage the grand and no
ble work that Mr. Watson is doing for
this Southland I can’t see. Surely he
is pre-eminently the greatest Com
moner living today.
Yours,
R. W. BAILEY.
Crenshaw, Miss.
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
FOOLING THE OLD POPS.
My Dear Sir:—l have been touch
ing elbows with you since Ignatius
Donnelly formulated, and the con
vention adopted, the Declaration of
Principles at St. Louis, February 22,
1901. I was a delegate to Cincinnati
when the first political action was
taken upon those principles, May
20th, of the same year, and the Peo
ple’s Party was organized upon the
same—all of which you know.
In that declaration, the Omaha
Platform, it is declared, “Land is the
heritage, etc., * * and should not
be held for speculative purposes.”
(Rents and profits)—only for actual
settlers, also is declared for public
lands.
The same platform set forward the
Initiative, etc., —all of which “you
have defended gallantly these many
years.
But, 10, now you come to the part
ing of the ways! No longer do you
advocate the Populist land plank or
the Referendum. Why this change?
Have you changed views? Would
not the Referendum put the have
nots at the ballot box, and therein
give them the opportunity which you
condemn the Socialists for? The
have-nots, being largely in the ma
jority, when they once know their
strength under Socialism would
TAKE property from the HAVES.
Tom, I am no schoolboy or spring
chicken, nor am I a mollycoddle. I
have bought every copy of your pub
lications from the first People’s
Party paper you published, and have
attended nearly every Pop conven
tion. But when you opened your
tirade against the Socialist, I wrote
you that three-fourths of the staunch
Populists were Socialists, from neces
sity and principle, and they are those
whose dollars make your subscrip
tion list, and yet you are h —l bent
to continue knocking them.
And what would the operation of
the Omaha platform result in but So
cialism?
You take up a list of foreigners
and repeat what they say and call it
Socialism. Don’t you know that the
Socialist party (cult) is the only or
ganized protest against organized
greed, that is rapidly sweeping this
country into abject slavery?
Tom, you did not open your mouth
in defense of Moyer, Haywood and
Pettibone. Neither did you write a
line in protection of the Russian
refugees, all of whom were saved by
Socialist protests.
Tom, you are a Daisy. You think
we old Pops haven’t sense enough to
know our own business. Socialism
is a growing power, and the ruling
powers realize it. Mark Hanna, T.
R. and others have seen enough.
Your challenge! That is child’s
play. Debs and others have no time
to listen to your buncombe. Tom,
what do you intend to get out of your
fight or your attack on Socialism?
Are you opposed to the present
public school system; postoffice sys
tem; public road system, or the land
plank in the Omaha platform or the
Referendum? Why not tell us old
Pops how you stand now on these?
Yes, I read both your Jefferson-
©b* Jeffersonian.
ians, and they are full of good things,
and some bad ones.
We “free love” Socialists don’t ad
mire the form of government you
set up and call Socialism. It exists
only in your fertile brain. The So
cialists of the United States will set
up a government suitable to the peo
ple governed when a majority con
trols the lawmaking departments.
Come on with your analysis and
caustic criticisms. We are in this
fight for our homes and our children
and their future against the combin
ed powers or organized greed under
the Socialist flag. You will have to
land in the Republican camp. The
Democratic party is dead as the d —l;
so is the Pop party.
Yours to the end,
(Dr.) I. A. WESSON.
Answer.
Dr. Wesson has become so bewil
dered that he has forgotten what our
old Platforms said about “Land.”
The St. Louis (1892) Platform
reads,
“The lands, including all the natu
ral sources of wealth, is the heritage
of all the people and should! not be
monopolized for speculative purposes,
and alien ownership of land should
be prohibited. All lands, now held
by railroads and other corporations
in excess of their actual needs, and
all land now owned by aliens, should
be reclaimed by the Government, and
held for actual settlers, only.”
That’s O. K. I’m as much in fa
vor of that plank as I ever was. A
man who has gone away from it, as
Dr. Wesson has, ought not to taunt
me because I have not left this pri
vate ownership platform to wade in
the bog of Socialism.
In that St. Louis platform,—the
first of Populist manifestoes, — private
ownership is expressly recognized in
the clause which demands homes and
farms for actual settlers.
To be held how? By the private
ownership system then in vogue.
The St. Louis platform denounces
speculative monopoly; not private
ownership.
The land is the home and heritage
of all the people, and all the people
who are alive, are living in it—but
Society has the right to say how the
citizen shall hold his share. The sys
tem of land-ownership now in exist
ence had its origin in the recognition
of the tenant’s right to enjoy the im
provements that he had made on his
allotment of wild, tribal land.
In the Populist Platform of 1904,
the land plank is—
“ Land * * * should not be
monopolized for speculative pur
poses.”
Not a hint is dropped against pri
vate ownership. On the contrary,
those things which ought to be pub
licly owned are enumerated. They
are as follows —
(1) Railroads and those public
utilities which in their nature are
monopolies.
(2) Telegraphs and telephones.
Who ever heard of the Populist
platform being construed to mean
that a man could not make “rents or
profits” out of land which he had
fairly, honestly bought? I never
heard of anything of the sort until
the receipt of this letter. When the
Democrats assailed our land-plank,
in the Nineties, contending that it
meant what Dr. Wesson now claims,
w r e hotly denied it, —every one of us.
In my own campaign for Congress,
I entered ageneral denial and, amid
the cheers of the Pops, demonstrated
that we had done nothing more than
declare against the monopolizing of
land for speculative purposes.
Had we Pops admitted in the
Nineties, that we put any such con
struction on our platform, as that
which Dr. Wesson now does, we
never would have amounted to a row
of pins. There never was a day
when I would have given my support
to any such platform.
As to the Initiative and Referen
dum, my position has undergone no
change. I believe in direct legisla
tion; but would not favor any sys
tem which would allow Ohio or Penn
sylvania to dictate to Delaware,
Georgia and Florida. The equality
of the States in the Senate must be
maintained. How silly it is to con
tend that, under the Initiative and
Referendum, “the have-nots, being
in the majority, would TAKE the
property from the Haves.” How
would they do it? I wonder if Dr.
Wesson fancies that we who believe
in the State, the church, the mono
gamous marriage system, and in
private property would sit idly by and
see the have-nots TAKE what we’ve
worked for, and honestly acquired.
Dr. Wesson says, in effect, that the
Populist platform in operation, would
result in Socialism. If that is so,
why didn’t the Socialists get on it?
If that is so, why did Dr. Wesson
leave it?
As to the “foreigners.” Herr
Bebel is the one accepted leader of
world-Socialism. He has led them in
the German Parliament for about
thirty years. If he doesn’t know
w 1 at Socialism means, nobody does.
Besides, I will prove that the So
cialist magazines and papers in this
country are in full sympathy and ac
cord with the “foreigners.” Just
keep on reading the Jeffersonians,
Doctor.
No; I did not open my mouth in
defense of Haywood, Moyer and Pet
tibone. My experience and intuition
as a lawyer told me that Harry Or
chard’s statement was essentially
true. Not in the Jeffersonians will
such murderers be defended. If em
ployed professionally, I would have
defended them in the Court-house,
holding that their guilt must be le
gally demonstrated before they could
be convicted.
“Tom, you are a Daisy.”
Sorry I can not fling a similar com
pliment your way, Doctor.
“Your challenge! That is child’s
play.”
Is it? If those national leaders of
Socialism fail to answer that chal
ige, their papers will lose even
more subscribers than they are now
losing. Debs, Warren, Wayland,
Bolton Hall, Victor Burger, Robert
Hunter, DARE NOT ACCEPT THAT
