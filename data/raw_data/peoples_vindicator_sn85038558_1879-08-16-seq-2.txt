There was never ut'erel a more pa.
triotic truelam than that of Macauley
when he said that "Constitutions,
his exist in vin fot those who will
not defend themt ;" nor is a more
or. pernicioui, nor more fatal doctrine
taught, than "nonresistance." The
Cavaliers fell into that error, ano
the came near losing their Oonstitution
and their liberties, when, after the
°qg Restoration, their sophists Incuklted
and maintained this, the most slavish
º.9o theory known to mankind. We fnd
in our Republic a large party exhibit
lag this doctrine in a form so exau
orated as to shock those who have
n- learned republican truths from the
Fill example and teachings of the patriot
fathers of the Revolution. This par
ty contends that "no breach of law
its or contract' no violation of the writ.
o ten Constitution of our country, can
justify a people in resisting by force
their constituted authorities. Nay,
there are those so far gone in this
theory as to brazenly contend that
all methods are closed to our people,
to right wrongs committed by these
. rulers, save through slavish forms,
which can be perverted to base uses
by any ambitious tyrant.
in We do not wonder that our North.
at era brethren should be carried away
with this fatal theory. With them,
forgetting the efforts of their fore
Ir- fathers, rebellion is associated, in
n their imagination, with subjection
t" and degradation, and authority, no
matter how arbitrary as covered by
the mere forms of law, with liberty
t and ascendency. The Indignity
is heaped upon a conquered South; the
Sinfamous acts of debased carpet
baggers, of brutal and ignorant ne
groes, in the fifteen Southern tates,
io their robbery, rapine and murder;
.e the violation of every principle of I
er justice in elections, culminating with i
.e the monstrous theft of a Presidency, I
in utter violation of the plainest pro. I
visions of our fundamental law. are I
t. to them but "justice meeted out to I
rebels." They do not think, as I
', these same Cavaliers did not thlnk, I
that a time will come when some c
despot will persecute the most loyal I
e of the Northern Unionist with the
animosity of Orant. When that v
Stime does come, as It surely will, a
P" what consolation will the logic used t
d to prove that "rebels" have no rights v
' that "loyalists" are bound to respect, r
y have in it when these same "loyal- u
SI sts" are divested in the manner they p
n now prescribe, of their rights and s
- liberties. 9
Mankind in all ages has been ac
tuated by the same motives, and so
long as time shall last cupidity and
f fear will be predominating paseions
0 in all who rule. The virtues ascrlb.
ed to the few are the exceptions, A
e and the historian halts upon the 0
r opinion, that the ruler, thus virtu.
t ous, found little to tempt him, else
i feared to risk the temptation. Our
Northern friends, In their madness
? on this question, will insist that no a
guile can rest In him who yielded
service to the "Union." The time i
will come, and if the signs portend
truly it is not far distant, when they
will find their most loyal rulers so. d
tusted by the same ambitton which d
has prompted man through all ages
to usurp power. When that day
comes we trust the ervile tuition
now instilled into the riding genera
tion may not have so far mastered
- theirspirit as toreader them unliat orb
powerless to strike an honest and
t manly blow for their freedom.

U- To THE GENERAL ASBEMBY :

Saccomplish a fair and equitable val
uation thereof. Within the Parish
of Orleans assessors are paid a per
' centage upon the amount of their

A farmer found a board placed so
as to cover an opening in a hillside
at Raynham, Mass. Removing the
board and crawling through the
alerture, he entered an underground
room, which was neatly boarded on
all sides, and contained all the a;
paratus necessary for making eun

roads and pathways, and the secret
would not have been discovered if
the wind had not blown a covering

sneaking of the death of Glendy
Burke:
Olendy Burke, whose sudden death
has just been chronicled, was one of
the merchant princes of New Or.
leans thirty-five or forty years ago,
It was, we believe. in the vyear 184
that he made a bet of $50 000 with a
large country planter on the total of
the cotton crop of that season. Mr.
Burke lost the bet and paid the mon.
ey promptly out of his then royal
revenues. 8tnce then he has been
reduced to the very verge of want.
The Coltat Chronicle says: The
first bale of new cotton is brought
forward again this year by Mr. C. A.
Pierson of Natchitoches arlish, liv
lot up ICne river, about two miles i
from colfax. The cotton was ginned
Thursday. August 7th, and the new
bale turned out about 3 o'clock in
the evening. Mr. Pierson informs us (
that he was none too soon with his
bale, as Mr. R Orant, on the 'oint
opposite this place, had his gin hunt
ming away briskly, and turned a
bale of the feecy staple two hours
later the same afternoon.
The DeSoto Demoorat says: The
fact that the Caterpillers have made g
their appearance in almost every
portion of this parish can no longer I
he denied. M.essrs. Walter Johnson
3. P. McElroy and (eo. H. Suther.
