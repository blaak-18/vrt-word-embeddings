On questioning the boy, he was aston

This is what you might call coneen

praise. tie has followed the advice so
often given to youthful-readers not to
scatter their reading, but to choose
somet subject and read it up thorough

The wrlting shows that the boy is
not whq~' Illiterate, for, while he has
no tnark.i for punctuation or the pox
ser-slve. every word is spelled correctly.
He has probably gone through the
sixth grade of a public school, perhaps
higher, and he is a type of thousands.

The veterinary surgeon was vaccinat

mal was muazzled, and an assistant held
its head. A space the size of a siler
dollar was shaved clean on its back,
and here the virus was being applied.
"I choose this spot to work on," said
the surgeon, "because the dog can't
scratch himself here. If i vaccinated
him on the leg, he would be apt to irri
tate the wound and make it v-ry soe.

Marconi's
Cape Cod
Station
[Special Correspondence.)
Welifleet, Mass., Janl. 1i.- This little
Cape Cod town is just now a ..nuter of
observation for not only the people of
Cape Cod, but also for the general pub.
lic, inltsmnuch as Marconil, the king of
wir'eless telegraphy, is here testing the
appalrtus installed in the Maroiil stn
tiola which has recently been completed.
The station is located about four miles
from the ancient Jo Holbrook tavern,
in1 W\elliteet, and one and a half mles
from the railway depot in South Well
fleet. It stands on a stretch of land the
highest for miles down or up the ('ape.
the site having been chosen by Mar
coni himself, who visited Wellfleet in
May, 11901, while exploring ('ape Cod to
find a suitable spot for a station. It Is
perhaps more than 100) feet above sea
level, and since the station has been
constructed mariners have found the
four lofty towers very useful as hland
marks.
As comphleted, tile Welltleit structure
bears a strong reseinblalnue to the wire.
less depots at Table Head and at I'N
thlla, ('ornwall, but the station lhre wtas
built only after some strenuotts work
and In the face of ditticulties not expe
rientced Iat the places just unamed. Th,'
nearest dwelling house is ia tlie away,
arind the wind, wlhitch has :an uninter
rupted sweep a('ross this stretch of
land, often rises to the violence of a
hurricane, blowing the sand throughl
the air so fiercely that blood will be
drawn from the faces of those who are
unfortunate enough to be exposed to
the combined assaults of wind and
sand.
The region, mnorover, Is te desolate
as one could well tind anywhere. There
is not enough fertility in the soil to Al
low it tree to grow to it respectable
height, and the stretch that is not whol
ly sand is covered with at growth of
wispish grass, an odd creeping vine
and stunted pines. But Maarconi deemed
it the best possible place froa which to
conduct his operations and made light
of the fact that the station would at all
times be exposed to the power of the
wind.
Accordingly, soon after he had lo
catel a site, a gang of men started to
dig foundations for the high masts of
Oregon pine which were to hold aloft
the wires of the systeam. These masts,
like the present towers, were more
than 200 feet high, and the old tiee
dents of Welliteet prophesied that they
would not last loang when a good olt
fashioned storm shoildr mpake Its ap
pearance. The prophets were right.
One cold December day of the same
year the people of WellHset awoke.to
find that of the twenty spars elected
but three were standing, and these
looked ready to topple over at at ay
time.
Undaunted, the Inventor gave order@'
that a fresh start should be imade.
Fifteen carloads of Oregon pfin were
required for the four great towers that
were to replace the wracked tmasts.
They were firmly set on foundations of
concrete and braced by stroag wire
cables. But despite their Rpparent v
rility the prophets of ~vil croakedaa.ge,
predicting that it would not be long
before they would go the way thli
masts had gone.
So far theio birds of ill ome hbare

gowns have high collars, but some open

few street dresses, will be made more
beautiful by the addition of rich
sashes. Ribbons in lovely soft pom
padour designs are seen and many
Persian patterns are shown in sash
widths, but the richest and handsomes:
are the crape sashes with the fringe.
