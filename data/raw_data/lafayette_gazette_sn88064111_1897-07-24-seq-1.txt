News Items Picked Up by The Gazette
Correspondeat.
We were sorry to hear that Miss
Leda, the charming daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. P. A. Delhomme,
was taken seriously sick during the
week. Miss Leda was working
hard and vigorously for the future
welfare of all Christians of Scott.
She was working faithfully and with
. all energy, soliciting in order to get
enough funds for the benefit of a
worthy edifice, a house of God,
when she, in her dutiful work, was
stricken with congestion of the
brains. But the Almighty is good
and knows his faithful workers, and
he has saved her to finish her task.
She is doing well and we hope to
see her up soon.
Mrs. M. A. Thomas sent us a
stalk of sugar ckne with 9 red joints,
raised on her farm south of Scott.
How's this for July and Scott?
Where does The Gazette sugar cane
come in now ?
Preparations have been made in
grand style, and the Scott people
are fully prepared to receive the
several thousand strangers who will
attend the grand fair. To-day
(Saturday) and Sunday will be gala
days of which the people of Greater
Scott will feel proud. It will be
two days when energy, money, en
terprise and amusements will be
cast before the people, showing
what can be accomplished by a
good, noble and christian popula
tion. It will be an example show
ing what great good a church is
and what education it can send
forth to our children, likewise a
great many gray-haired citizens.
The people of Scott have cried for
a church, prayed for one, and that
gentle prayer has been answered.
The Almighty wants a house in
every comamunity for the shelter of
his people, and Scott must and will
have one. The people at large are
helping us, and for that good and
kind deed we bow and say thanks.
We are having bad weather, but
our large water-proof pavilion will
hold us out, and we have arranged
with the weather man to hold up
with rain for a few days.
We wish to state to your many
readers, that free transportation
will be granted to each and every
one to and from the fair grounds.
The committees have arranged for
soo double teams and will be ready
to transport everybody in all parts
of the city to see the sights.

On His Way Home.
Readers of The Gazette may re
member the case of W. J. Deady,
who, in February, :896, walked
ibato the sheriff's office and delivered
himself up to the authorities for
having killed a man in Eureka,
Ark., fifteen years before. He
then stated that he could not stand
the strain any longer and wanted to
stand trial. He was lodged in jail
by the authorities here, awaiting the
coming of the proper officials from
Arkansas, who soon took him in
custody, and who then expressed
themselves favorably as to his
chances of acquittal.
A few days ago Mr. Deady
passed through town on his way to
Houma, 'where he has a wife and
two children.
He says he had no trouble in
getting clear, and that he was
treated with all possible courtesy by
the Arkansas officials. He stopped
in Lafayette to again return thanks
to the officers here for the kind
tireatqpnt he received at their hands,
while incarocrated in the parish jail.

Short Paragraphs diving the
News of the Week.
W. R. Foote made a trip to La.
fayette Saturday.
Sidney Debarge returned home
last week, after several months' ab
sence.
Malichi Perry and fasmily spent
a day with relatives in Acadia last
week.
Varanus Spell went to Rayne
Monday.
Rev. Reams, after preaching a
week at the Indian Bayou church,
returned to Lafayette Saturday.
Constable Cummings sports a
new saddle and also an injured
hand.
- The protracted meeting at the
Indian Bayou church came
to a close last Friday. There were
several conversions and accessions
to the church. Judging from the
reports adrift "cupid's dart has
pierced full many a heart" and we
expect to hear of a large number of
weddings this fall.
Dr. M. L. Lyons is at Sour Lake,
Texas, for the benefit of his health.
Our thanks are due Dr. Breaux
for several baskets of delicious figs.
The schools in this vicinity
opened last Monday with a fair

O. C. P.
A Negro Killcd.
At a negro marriage feast near
Royville last Monday evening,
Joachim Broussard shot and fatally
wounded another negro by the name
of Emile Girouard.
The two parties seem to have
been on friendly terms and it is
claimed the shooting was acci
dental. Girouard was shot in the
abdomen and died the next day.
Sheriff Broussard visited the scene
of the shooting and lodged Brous
sard in the parish jail Monday
evening. There were no immediate
witnesses, but it is said the wounded
man acknowledged that it was an
accident, and Azenore Bosset, who
went to the man as soon as he fell,
says Girouard blamed Broussard
only for the careless handling of
his pistol. Broussard is still in jail.
Coroner Trahan held an inquest
Wednesday and the jury returned a
verdict simply saying that the dead
man had received a mortal wound
from a pistol shot.
It appears that the witnesses con
tradict one another and it is
doubted whether the man shot him
self or whether Broussard did, on
account of the contradictory state
ments of the witnesses. As there
were no actual witnesses to the
deed, it is difficult to ascertain
whether there was foul work or not,
and the officers will have another
mystery to unravel.
The Scott Fair.
Our readers will see in our Scott
column that there will be a grand
fair at Scott to-day and to-morrow
for the benefit of the church, which
the good people of that progressing
town and vicinity are determined to
erect. The railroads have agreed
to sell tickets at one and one-third
fare.
The people of Lafayette parish
should respond to the deserving
efforts of our sister town to make.a
success of this laudable enterprise,
and, no doubt, they will do so.
Extensive preparations have been
made to. accomnmodate visitors, and
provide for their amusement and
entertainment.

ONLY ONE SURVIVOR.
But One of the Eight Men Who
Downed Knownothingism in
Louisiana.
N. O. Daily States, July 17, 1897.
fhe New Orleans Daily States in
its issue of the sand of December,
x89g, published. the following Dew~
ocratic State ticket in the memora
ble political campaign of z855 for
the mastery between the Demo
cratic and Knownothing or Ameri
can parties in Louisiana:
Democratic State Ticket.
For Governor:
ROBERT C. WICKLIFFE,
Of West Feliciana.
For Lieut. Governor:
CHARLES H. MOUTON,
Of Lafayette.
For Secretary of State:
ANDREW S. HERRON,
Of East Baton Rouge.
For Auditor:
SAMUEL F. MARKS,
Of West Feliciana.
For Treasurer:
C. E. GRENEAUX,
Of Natchitoches.
For Attorney General:
E. WARREN MOISE,
Of New Orleans.
For Superintendent of Education:
SAMUEL BARD,
Of Carroll.
FOR CONGRESS:
Second District:
MILES TAYLOR,
Of Assension.
And made the statement that of
all the men whose names are on this
ticket there was then only one sur
vivor, viz.: Robert C. Wickliffe.
This was an error on the part of
the States. In Decenmber, 289z,
Charles H. Mouton, who was can
didate for Lieutenant Governor on
the same ticket was then living in
St. Martinvalle, where he was tak
ing a very active part in organizing
Democratic clubs throughout the
parish against the lottery amend
ment; and when the old gentleman
saw the name of Robert C. Wick
liffe as the candidate for Lieuten
ant Governor on the McEnery
ticket it pained him very much, for
the name of Robert C. Wickliffe
brought to his mind reminicenses
of many exciting incidents of the
campaign of x855, when men,
women and young people of all
shades of political opinion and of
religious faith would assemble in
large crowds to hear Robert C.
Wickliffe, "Blue Grass Bob,"
Charles H. Mouton, "the Creole
Pony," Andrew S. Herron, "The
Whole-souled Major," E. Warren
Moise, "the Plucky Jew and Ready
Debator," discuss in free and joint
debates with their opponents, re
ligious tolerance.
Mr. C. H. Mouton is yet living,
and, we believe, is now the only
one left of the eight men whose
names are on the Democratic State
ticket of 2855. He is practicing
law in St. Martinville, La.; he is
healthy and active. He comes to
his office every morning at 9
o'clock, sometimes afoot and some
times on his pony. He goes to
dinner at twelve and comes back. to
his office at two. He takes a lively
interest in the political questions of
the present day and although over
73 years of age, he hopes that in
9goo he will be able to help in
striking a death blow to monopo
lies, trusts and class legislation.
Century Club Smoker.
There were quite a number of
guests entertained at the club rooms
of the Century Club last Monday
night, among them quite a delega
tion from Carencro. Owing to a
sudden death in the family of some
of the members, the. smoker pro
gram was not carried out, but the
members present did all they could
to entertain those who came and
while they had a quiet time, every
one, expressed himself as lfaving
had a pleasant evening and all look
forward with pleasant anticipation
to another smoker.

Mrs. Anna M. Caffery.
At Alexandria, on July zg, Mrs.
Anna M. Caffery, widow of the late
Jefferson J. Caffery, died at the
residence of her son-in-law, Charles
M. Kilpatrick. She was born June
9, 1830. Her death occurred after
a few days illness and was a great
shock to her family and friends.
She was born and raised in this par
ish and with her husband and fam
ily resided here until about z88o.
She was a daughter of the late Basil
C. Crow, one of the early settlers
in this parish, a lawyer of distinction
who practiced in this and adjoining
parishes.
Mrs. Caffery is pronounced by all
who knew her to have been a wo
man of exceptionally fine traits of
character; she was pre-eminently a
Christian woman; in all the rela
tions of life, whether as daughter or
sister, wife or mother, she was kind,
devoted and true. Her life was one
of devotion and self-sacrifice for the
good of others. She was charitable
to a fault. She examplified to a
high degree all womanly virtues.
The pattern of her life was the
"Mother in Israel" because it was
in that relation that none surpassed
her. Indeed, it is true, "Her
children rise up and call her
blessed," for she has left theon the
estimable heritage of a glorious life;
the memory of her to them must be
one of the grandest ever left by
parent to child.
Three daughters and four sons
sui yve her.
She was a sister of Mrs. M. E.
Girard, and the late Mrs. S. T. Ir
win.
Her remains were brought here
and laid beside her husband and
children who had gone before.
Dr. N. Moss of Latayette arrived
on Thursday on a business visit.
He had not been in Rayne for fif
teen years.-Rayne Tribune.
