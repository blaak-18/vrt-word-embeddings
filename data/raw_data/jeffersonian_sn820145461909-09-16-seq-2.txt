ILL no one say a word in de
fense of the nurses of the
Georgia State Sanitarium?
It is a burning shame that
intelligent men and women, boys
and girls, should be held up to pub
lic as brutes or anything of the sort.
It is a fact that there are some in
the institution not very well suited
for the work, but by far the great
er number of the nurses are above
the average man or woman whose
life has been one long, hard strug
gle for existence and it would be
absolutely impossible to find a man
or woman who did not have to work
who would do the work required of
the employees of the state at this
place, and the higher you go the less
sympathy and forbearance you will
find manifested toward the suffering
and afflicted. Where the man or
woman highly educated would turn
away with a thrill of horror, per
haps, we must hesitate at nothing,
no matter how menial the labor, nor
how great the danger, we must do
for these people things that many,
many of the people of the State of
Georgia would hesitate to do for
their own.
It is hard, bitter hard, to know
that all your life only the dirty,
nasty work will fall to your lot, (and
that through no fault of your own)
that always you must be poorly paid,
always to toil with no chance ever
to improve. Horrid doesn’t express
it. And yet all over the State of
Georgia goes up the cry that the in
mates of the Sanitarium are treated
as convicts; are being beaten and
starved into submission to the will
of indiscriminate nurses, which is
false absolutely. The man or wom
an who has never had the trial of
caring for and bearing with the in
sane cannot give me advice as to
how to deal with them, and if
brought in actual contact with the
problem of daily caring for and di
recting them, would fall far short of
what they expect in others.
The public doesn’t know, will
never know, of the questions to be
met and answered at a moment’s no
tice. Many times the question is
one of life and death and only im
mediate action and drastic measures
will prevent your taking a trip to
“kingdom come”.
The “States most unfortunate
wards” are in the Sanitarium because
they are a menace to society, then
must we, citizens of this same state,
close our eyes and let the blows fall
where they will? If we did, the
state would have to employ a new
set of nurses and physicians every
few months. Won’t some one who
doesn’t know anything of life here
come and spend a year with us —then
think, then think some more. True,
more personal attention could be
given some or all the patients and
not be given amiss, but to do this
the number of nurses must be in
creased, for already the burden is
heavy on those here.
But in spite of all that has been
said, the fact still remains that there
are hundreds of people in the State
Sanitarium better cared for than ever
before in their lives, and that there
are hundreds of men, women and

children in Georgia not in the Sani
tarium who are in a far worse plight
(barring their mental condition)
than those in this institution. As
Carlyle said of England, Georgia
contains so many thousands of men
—mostly fools—it goes without say
ing that they are not all in the San
itarium. I would make no excuse
for wrong-doers, but don’t put the
blame all on this institution, but on
the state, where it properly belongs.
The recent Legislature is noted for
having done nothing. It is up to
them to relieve the minds of our peo
ple of any doubtful distress in re
gard to the treatment their people
receive here. Let the people know
the truth.
One thing more, there is not a
physician in this institution who
would stand for mistreatment of the
patients under his care, not one. The
public should also remember that
someone may have “an axe to grind”,
and see to it that they don’t get it
ground for nothing.
“GEORGE MARTIN.”
Milledgeville, Ga.
We have printed other articles by
“George Martin” and it is but fair
that space should be given to this.
It is very unfortunate, truly, that
any well-intentioned, kindly, self
sacrificing nurse or attendant has
to suffer in public estimation. Per
haps this is a very potent reason
why conditions in any institution
should not be allowed to come to
such a pass that the innocent have
to suffer with the guilty. However,
an investigation is not meant as an
“attack” upon any particular indi
vidual or set of individuals. The
management, primarily, is to blame
for retaining improper employees
and thus doing double injustice to
those who are doing their full duty,
first by paying them no more than
the negligent, and second by sub
jecting them to the humiliation of
knowing that they, en masse, labor
under a cloud of doubt. We are
glad to believe that “George Mar
tin” has found many who are doing

their best for the unfortunates under
the care of the state, and hope that
the investigation now under way will
serve to give all due credit to such.
However, we must remind our cor
respondent that even an attendant
does not know the full workings of
an asylum. In the female wards, for
instance, how can attendants there
know the things which go on in the
wards that are under the control of
the male attendants alone? And it
is in these wards that the complaints
of brutality seem mostly to have aris
en. The investigating committee re
ported that the male attendants who
testified were, several of them, in
toxicated, and altogether unfit for
the responsibilities of their positions
—indeed, hardly seemed to compre
hend that they should come sober
before the men sent there to inquire
into conditions. This opens up a
frightful vista of thought; are
drunken men given unlimited power
over the helpless? Don’t we know
how the tenderest husband and fath
er has, under the influence of liquor,
beaten and abused, or even murder
ed his family? Enough has been
proved to show that very many
things are seriously in need of cor
rection, and surely this can be done
without damaging any well-earned
reputation for fidelity and kindness
on the part of anyone connected with
the institution.
As to the underscored remark that
it “would be absolutely impossible to
find a man or woman who did not
have to work w’ho would do the
work required of the employees of
the state at this place,” we feel like
taking gentle issue. Not knowing
the rule at Milledgeville, but under
standing the well established cus
tom of other similar places, no man
or woman of the slightest bodily in
firmity, or of inferior physique, is
desired. This means that the able
bodied alone are employed, it being
well understood that sickly attend
ants could not be expected to show
that firmness and patience so requi
site and that cheerfulness so desira
ble. And it is hard to believe that
there is a well, capable woman who
couldn’t earn about as much, else
where, as she can make as nurse in
the asylum. Homes are crying too
loudly for help, paying too good
wages; opportunities here, for

women, are too abundant. But it
might involve servitude! And far
better bathe the slobbering epileptics
at an asylum, than to bathe the
sweet little babies of some over-bur
dened, worn-out mother who is eager
for assistance, and cannot find any
reliable, tender, womanly girl or
woman to be one of the family and
hold up her tired hands. For men,
there is perhaps a lesser field, but
still a field, wherein the able-bodied
laborer could obtain his hire.
It is a grave statement to make
that attendants in our state institu
tions are there merely for the small
wages they receive. That, in itself,
renders them unfit. It makes them
resentful of any extra trouble occa
sioned by the needs or wants of a
patient; makes them resentful of
the routine; makes them come al
most to hate the poor creatures who
cause it, not realizing that if it were
not for the presence of those very
unfortunates, the attendants would
not have the positions which mean
bread and butter, shelter and cloth
ing, companionship with others do
ing similar work, plenty of time for
rest and recreation, and, in short,
those very advantages which led
them to choose the state work rather
than seek employment elsewhere!
There isn’t a doctor who doesn’t go
through a hard training, who doesn’t
have to do constantly the most me
nial services for others, if he stopped
to consider his help to suffering as
“menial.” There is not a nurse who
doesn’t have a period of dull proba
tion, doing work that many a servant
would disdain, and who does not,
throughout her practice, have to en
counter disagreeables of all sorts,
captious, ungrateful, untruthful pa
tients, offensive wounds, sleepless
nights and trying days, general hard
ship which shortens her life by
many a year. Yet, she doesn’t think
she is terribly imposed on, and she
chose the work from love of service,
not money.
In no place does love lighten labor
so much as in that work which deals
direct with humanity. At best, all
are faulty, and the sick in mind or
body would be abhorrent to us if we
approached them just for pay. There
must be loving kindness and loving
forgiveness always. No one can teach,
or nurse or attend upon another with
any self-satisfaction without feeling
a sincere wish to give happiness and
comfort. There is no creature so
loathsome, so abhorrent, but that we
ourselves may come to resemble.
The beautiful, cultured woman today
may be a screeching, senseless hag
tomorrow, tearing off her clothing,
kept decent with difficulty; the
brainy man of this year may be a
lunatic, gross and vile, the next; and
before us all who may live beyond
our three-score-and-ten looms the
possibility of a senility that may
leave us doddering wrecks upon the
shore of time, waiting for the tide
that will mercifully bear us away
from those whom our lingering bur
dens. We should be very humble,
very patient, when we think of these
things, and not unwilling to do even
the menial work, not resentful at our
