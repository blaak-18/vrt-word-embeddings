what The Gazette man has been
told. The "*Nine Devils" is the

suggestive appelation be a misno

to achieve great victories. They
enter the field with determination
to win some fresh laurels and no
one at all acquainted with them will
doubt their aoility fo do so, if they
will only practice. Lafayette needs

Died.
Mrs. M. R. Vest, born Martha
S. Rand, died at the home of Mrs.
WV. C. Abbott in Lafayette on Tues
day, May 28, at 4:30 o'clock. The
death of Mrs. Vest was the result
of injuries received from a fall from
a sulky some twvo weeks ago. The
unfortunate lady is said to have suf
fered very much as her injuries
were of a very painful nature. All
that skillful physicians and the kind
hands of affectionate ones could do
helped only to lessen pain and pro
long her life a few days.
Mrs. Vest was the mother of four
little children and her death is a
cruel blow to them. She was held
in high esteem by the people of this
town and the large number of mour
thers who followed her remains to
the grave was exp)ressive of the sor
row felt at the loss of a good chris
tian mother. The funeral services
were conducted by the Revs. T. S.
and R. Randle of the M. E. Church.
A Dance.
[Communicated.]
A most enjoyable dance was
given at the hospitable home of
Mr. A. R. Lisbony last Thursday
night. Messrs. O. Delhomme,
Lucien Chopin and Louis Bazin
assisted Mr. Lisbony in receiving
and it is needless to say that all the
guests were attended to. Mr. Ba
zin and Miss Mamie Lisbony, the
daughter of the host, led the grand
march. Whenever the young peo
ple desire to have a good time they
gather at the home of the genial
Mr. Lisbony who delights in re
ceiving them at all times. He is
one of those who believe that the
young folks must have their fun,
and he generally does all in his
power to see that they have it.

15 IT A' TIEASURE ?
A Safe Found in Lake 1Martin by
a-Party of Gentlemen Out
Fishing.
Last Sunday a party of gentle
meh went out fishing at Lake l4ar
tin. One of them was compelled
to wade in the water to disentangle
his line and while searching for it
he felt something with his hand
which proved to be a chain. Of
course this excited his curiosity and
he fellowed the chain until he
reached something which he at first
failed to describe, but after a closer
exatmination by feeling about the
object with his hands and feet he
was convinced that- it was an iron
safe. Of this there was no doubt.
Further investigation disclosed the
fact that the safe was tied by two
chains which were fastened at the
other ends to trees in the lake. He.
lost no time and told his compan
ions of the strange discovery that
he had just made. All came to the
conclusion that the safe had to be
lifted out of the water and as they
were not provided with the means
necessary to do so, they went home
and returned to the lake the next
day with the fixed determination to
get the safe out of the water and
see if there was any money in it, but
unfortunately they could not locate
it. After hours of futile efforts to
find the supposed tresasure they
gave up the job for the day, but
they are, by no means, discouraged.
One of the party informed The
Gazette that they would return to
the lake and leave nothing undone
to find the safe, which they hope,
contains untold wealth.
We desire it to be distinctly un
derstood that this is no canard. It
was told to The Gazette by a thor
oughly reliable person who says he
can prove everything he said.

DR. MAYER RESIGNS.
He Leaves the Office of A~isestant
Quarantine Physician.
Times-Democrat.
pr. Fred M. Mayer, the assistant quaran
tine physician, handed his resignation to Dr.
Wilkinson yesterday. He will return to his
home in Lafayette and take up his practice
again. The d6ctor has had an interesting
career.
Dr. Fred J. Mayer, df Lafayette, native
of the Attakapas, is thirty-six years of age
and a bachelor, of Germsn-Irish extraction,
his father, Prof. Mayer, of St. Landry, be
ing the youngest son of the late, famous
Prof. Carl. Mayer, of Munchen, Bavaria,
professor of mutsic in the University Royal,
musician for fifty years and the life-long
friend and intimate of old King Ludwig.
1i4s mother is the youngest daughter of the
late Mark O'Rorke, a scion of the ancient
Leitrim-Meath fadily of that name. Dr.
Mayer removed with his family to Munich,
Bavaria, in i860. In 1863 they moved to
London; where they remained two years,
and then moved to Belfast, Ireland; where
they remained five years, going to Opelou
sas in 1871, where the family still lives.
The docter received his education from
private tutors in the Methodist College of
Belfast and in the public schools of Ope
lousas, under the famous old pedagogue,
Calvin Frayzee. He commenced life at
fourteen, teaching school, and pursued that
avocation for seven years in various parts of
St. Landry and Acadia, including the pub
lic schools of Opelousas and Washington,
in the interval studying medicine, in which
he graduated in 18S2 at the University of
Louisiana. In 1889 he attended a short
course at St. Thomas Hospital, under Sir
William McCormac: later he attended the
Necker, in Paris.
The doctor is a Democrat of the White
League stripe: he took part when a boy in
the first Nicholls campaign in t778, in St.
Landry. In i88z he removed to Lafayette
parish, where for ten years he practit:ed his
profession, building up a large and lucrative
-i
practice, which he completely broke up by
the very active part he took in the Gay and
Price congressional campaigns and in the
Nicholls and anti-lottery fights. He placed
Gov. Nicholls in nomination in the famous
convention of 1888. He was a member of
the State Central Committe for Lafayette at
that time. lie secured the homination of
Gov. Foster in the convention of 189z, of
which body he was a member. IIe was ap
pointed assistant quarantine physician of
Louisiana in 1892, when the Legislature
paid hint the unsual compliment of raising
the salary $b1o2 by A urianimou5 vote in the
Senate and only eight dissenting votes in the
House.
In 1892 he was president of the Attakapas
Medical Association; in 1889 he was their
drator. and delivered a lengthy address on
sanitary entombment; in 1893 he was chosen
chairman, by Prof. Miles, of the section on
quarantine of the State Medical Society,
and read an elaborate report thereon. In
1894 he was chosen chairman of the section
on quarantine by Prof. Matas, and chair
man of the section on public hygience. In
1895 he was re-elected chairman of the sec
tion on quarantine:
He took an active part in tlie great medi
cal debate on the new State medical examin
ing law. He introduced and secured the
passage of a great number of resolutions in
the State Medical Society on sanitary and
quarantine matters. As a member of the
American Public Health Association he took
a postive stand in debate in the City of
Mexico against Federal interference itii State
quarantines: As assistant quarantine phy
sician he was active in the discharge of his
official duties, while making every effort to
minimize the unavoidable hardships of Quar
antine. At various times he held both the
upper station and the Port Ends station at
the Same time.
At the recent session of the State Medical
Society he read a report on quarantine.
which was fully discussed and highly com
plimented by Dr. Formento, a member of
the State Board of Health. In this report
he urged modification of quarantine restric
tions, and suggested the use of Formic
Aldehyde in quarantine practice. Ilis withi
drawal from the sanitary service of the State
is to be regretted.
