WHIRLING AWAY FROM GEOR
GIA.
By Thomas Malone Wheless.
I am whirling away from Georgia,
Rushing from Dixie Land,
While the gathering shade of the
evening has laid
The mantle of dusk at my hand.
The sentinel pines, looming dark in
the> woods,
Stand sullen and gaunt and my an
swering moods
Are tinged by the hovering shadow
that broods —
While I am hasting from Georgia.
I am whirling away from Georgia,
Saddened in heart and mind,
For my cycles of thought are with
memories fraught
Os the dear ones I left behind.
Yet —must I confess it? —as strange
as it seems,
The rarest effulgence persistently
gleams
Amongst darkest musings and bright
ens my dreams —
While I am hasting from Georgia.
I am whirling away from Georgia,
Bound for a distant strand,
But I bear to the west, woman’s love
at its best "
And I found it in Dixie Land.
So that is the reason my musings
grow bright
As we rush through the lowering
shadows of night,
And my heart is enthused with a
glow of delight
While I am hasting from Georgia.
We hear a lot of talk about scien
tific farming, agriculture, etc. There
is also a commission appointed by the
president going over the country try
ing to find out what the farmer needs
and what can be done for him that
he may be happy. We have no ob
jection to all of these things, but if
we were asked question, how can
farm life be made more prosperous or
how can the farmer’s burden be made
easier, we would suggest to first give
him the land absolutely for farm pur
poses and allow no man to speculate
in land; second, government loan
money just like it does to banks;
third, stop farmers paying dividends
on eight billion dollar watered rail
road bonds; fourth, stop paying trib
ute to the millionaire manufacturers
when the farmer’s products go to
free trade markets; fifth, stop paying
one hundred sixty million per year
to the steel trust, to the oil trust,
and all the other trusts. You will
never benefit the farmer very much
any other way. The above named
evils are the sole cause of the farm
ers’ organization. The farmer must
either get more for his products or
pay less for what he buys. It would
be better for humanity if all things
were regulated in proportion to the
actual cost of production.—-Farmers’
Union Advocate, Shawnee, Okla.
Rockefeller and Archbold both stat
ed, under oath the other day, that
the Standard Oil Co. took rebates and
combined with other companies in re
straint of trade. Both these offenses
are criminal and subject to punish
ment by fine or imprisonment or both.
