I Ii in morning of tlio rout of Kellogg,
»ml Iiis force», "horse foot and dra

the government of oppressed Louisia

tlirill of joy to every manly heart and
raised a shout of exultation that is

It remains now to be seen whether
tho military forces of thcUnitcd States
government will again interfere to re
seat tlie usurper, Kellogg, or whether
they will permit Louisiana, to do what
Texas, and Arkansas did and, allow
u s to retain our rightful
government. The government of Lou
isiana is to dayde facto and until its
dcjnre claims are adjudicated upon by
Congress, it is'entitled to have and
hold its present position. The issue
is now forced upon President Grant,
and the responsibility as the odium is
his if ho interferes. Let him hold off
aud tho question is settled. A happy
feature of the movement, and one from
which wo derive no small encourage
ment, is that the negroes are not mixed
up at all with it. Only one negro was
killed and lie was killed by an explo
sion in the ainiory while held by the
Kellogg forces. All the rights of the
colored people are guaranteed to them
and if tliey are wise they will join their
fortunes with ours in this contest for
good government.

The Campaign.
The public mind at last is at rest
in reference to tho division in tbe
ranks of tho white people of this
Parish. As great unanimity exists
in tbe ranks of the white people, as
over existed before in any party,
and while some few persons may be
dissatisfied with individual names
on our ticket, yet, there will bo uo
scratching on the day of election,
as the people are satisfied, that by
so doing, they would assist directly
in perpretrating Radical rule in
this Stato and Parish. Let the
people remember that iu a repre
sentative and democratic govern
ment like ours, that each individual
can not always get a nomination
for his friend or for his particular
choice for any position, and it is
therefore his duty to abide by the
selection made by the majority of
his fellow-citizens.
Personal prejudice as well as per
sonal favoritism should not influ
ence the action of any voter in a
contest like the present one, as the
nominees of the White People's
Paity represent a great and living
principle, and iu their defeat, sinks
the cause id' honest and good gov
ernment of peace, progress and
prosperity, to tbo present a» wc] |
as to tho luturo generations.
While the white people have no
desire or intention of interfering
with the rights of the colored race,
yet they demand that the govern
ment shall be administered and
controlled by honest and intel
ligent men, who from interest,
experience and capacity, will be en

which they stand, and by public

Our Parish Ticket.
I d the press and Lurry of getting
out onr issue last week, and from
an unexpected number of new adver
tisements, which together with the
proceedings of the Convention and
Railroad documents, took up all
our space, we omitted to say any
thing abont our Candidates. In
fact we had barely room for a short
editorial about the troops.
Our Convention of the 5th inst.,
was composed ot delegates from
every Ward in tho Parish, except
two, and was made up bf the rep
resentative men from all parts of
tho Parish. They discharged their
duties iu a most acceptable manner
and put forward the very best men
wo have, for the positions to be fill
ed by this election. The nomina
tions for the Legislature, challenge
tho respect and confidence of our
entire community, and ensures their
election by a handsome majority.
No man stands higher or is more
entitled to the support and esteem
of our people than Dr. Robert L.
Liicket. The very mention of his
name calls up the idea of all that is
noble and worthy in man. Capt.
James Jeftries is a high toned gen
thoroughly posted in the iniquities
that have been heaped upon us by
corrupt legislation, and has both
the capacity and determination to
devise the remedies for the evils
under which we have so long suf
fered. He married one of the
wealthiest and most accomplished
daughters of Rapides, aud is in ev
cry way identified with us and our
. J J
interests. The choice of a gentle
man so well fitted by his position,
j intelligence aud high sense of honor
as is Capt. Jeflries, to represent
Rapides iu the Legislature, was a
most happy one, and gives univer
sal satisfaction. Ot Mr. Geo. W.
Stafford, a worthy son of a most
noble sire whose heroic deeds have
shed a lustre upon tbe name ot our
Parish, we are debarred from
speaking by reason of his connec
tion with us as one of the Editors
of this paper, lie needs uo com
ment at our hands to commend
him to the people of Rapides.
Mr. David C. Paul, the nominee
for Sheriff, to which position lie
was elected in 1872, but was de
prived of his office by federal bay
onets, is a man universally beloved
and admired. He has lived amongst
us all his life, and no man can say
a word of reproach against him.
We will under his administration
ol the Sheriff's Office, have a most
able and conscientious officer.
Judge Henry L. Daigre lias filled
the position of Parish Judge before,
aud is familiar with its duties.
Tho large vote received by him iu
the Convention is the best evidence
of his popularity. This was in no
small degree owing to the stand
taken by him in 1872, in upholding
his right to the office to which he
was then elected.
And now what shall we say of
And now what shall we say of
, our friend Nelson Taylor for Coro
j »er ? Every body knows Nels, and
J every body likes him. He was
nominated by one of the largest
votes of the Convention, and will
discharge the duties of tho office
with zeal aud fidelity.
Of the nominations for Police
Jurors, wo can only say, without
individualizing, that they were the
very best that could be made, and
guarantee an economical and sat
isfactory management of our parish
finances.
Now, men of Rapides! there is
our Parish ticket, those are the
men for whom you are to vote in
November. We ask you if you
could be better pleased, if you
would have any better Î Let every
man now go to work, work early
and late, work all the time, aud
never cease to work until every man
iu the parish shall have registered
and voted for them, aud then if
| they are fairly elected, don 't Stop
. there, bllt See that they are i tl Stall
ed in their offices. Remember this,
that if you are dissatisfied with any
man or names on tho ticket, those
names are infinitely superior to the
! thieves and ignorant negroes, the
\ radicals have had in office, and will
|doubtless put in nomination again.|

John A. William#, Esq., Chairman
Executive Committee :
Dear S ir —I am in receipt of yours
of the 8th inst., informing ine of my
nomination on the Legislative ticket.
No more astonishing information
could have been conveyed to me, and
at first, fur reasons which woald oc
cupy too much spaco here, I was
fixed in my determination not to ac
cept. But after consultation with
many Liends, I have concluded that
as the burden must bo borne by some
citizen, it is perhaps no heavier for
mc than for either of the gentlemen
associated with me ou the ticket.
In this dark hour of our history I
do not know that any of ns have the
right to shirk any burden that may
bo imposed by our fellow-citizens in
the struggle for the identification of
our State, therefore returning thanks
to the Convention for this unexpect
ed aud unsolicited mark of confi
dence, I accept their nomination, and
in connection with my colleagues
hopo to see most of my fellow-citi
zens before the day of election.
1 shall, if elected, use all the power
that in me lies, to redeem the State
from its present condition of misrule
and corruption. Aud will cheerfully
join bauds with honest men of all
parties to that end. It is natural
fur me to be conservative in politics,
and whilst I am tbe Candidate of
tho People's Party, standing square
ly on their platform, I solicit tbe
voles of all who desire to seo a re
turn to honest government, and to
soo law justly and strictly enforced
and administered, guaranteeing to
every citizen, whether white or black,
all tho rights conferred upon him by
tho laws of the land.
Hoping that we are upon the eve
of a better day for our opjfressed
State, I am Sir,
Very Respectfully,
Your Obedient Servant,

REDEEMED
We publish in full tbe following
account of the receut glorious vic
tory of the rightful government of
Louisiana over tbe Usurper, Kel
logg and his boasted Metropolitans,
taken from the New Orleans Bui•
letin and Picayune of Wednesday.
It will be seen that the conflict sought
nay forced, by Kellogg, the usurper,
his entire police force wss killed or
dispersed, and that the State govern
ment is now in the hands of its le
gally constituted and duly elected of
ficers. Lieutenant Governor D. B
Penn, in the absence of Governor
McEnery is acting Governor and
commanding the militia forces of the
State. The United States troops
sympathized with the citizens, and
are not to interfere. Grant has is
sued his proclamation commanding
our forces to disperse in Ave days.
The very latest, which we glean from
the Picayune, of Wednesday evening,
has the City quiet and every tiling
working finely and harmoniously un
der the proper and legitimate govern«
ineut of Louisiana.
Sntnrday night posters were Issued
calling on citizens to assemble Monday
morning on Canal street, from the levee
to Claiborne street. This handbill was
supplemented Sunday morning by the
following In the Bulletin :
For nearly two years yon have been
the silent but Indignant sufferers ot
outrage after outrage—heaped upon you
by a usurping government.
One by one yonr dearest rights have
been trampled upon, until, at last. Iu
tbo supreme height of its Insolence,
tills mockery of a Republican govern*
ment lias dnred even to deny you that
right so solemnly guaranteed by the
very constitution of the United State»-,
which, In article two of the amend
ments, declares that "the right of tho
people to keep and bear arms shall not
be infringed.
In that same sacred Instrument, to
whose inviolate perpetuity our fathers
pledged ''their lives, their fortunes aud
their sacred honor, it was also declared
that even Congress shall mako no law
abridging" the right of the people
peaceably to assemble and to petition
the government for a redress of griev
ances. It now remains for us to ascer
tain whether this right any longer re
mains so.
We, therefore, call upon you on Mon
day morning, the fourteenth day of
September, 1874, to close your places of
businees, without a single exception,
and at 11 A. M., to assemble at the Clay
statue, on Canal street, and in tones
loud enough to be heard throughout the
length and breadth of the land declare
that you are of right, ought to be and
mean to be free. ... >.

Robert Hare, 8am Flower,
J. B. Sinnot, And fiO others.
At about half-pant 11 o'clock Mr.
R. H. Marr and other gentlemen of
the Committee of Seventy, called to
gether the people around the Cres
cent Billiard Saloon.
Some five thousand men were
quickly assembled and M. Musson
was unanimously called to the chair,
which he took.
Vice Presidents—Sam. Bell, H.
Renshaw, J. I Adams, Peny Nugent,
Sam. Flower, S. H. Boyd, M. Gülls,
Robert Hare, Jules Vairin, Louis
Bush, J. J. Gidiere, J. K. Russ, J. J.
Warren.
Mr. Marr then read an address to the
people of Louisiana, showing .the
right the people had to bear arms.
He then read a series of resolutions,
as follows:
Whereas, at a general election held
in Louisiana on the 4th day of No
vember. 1872, Jno. McEnery was
elccted Governor by a majority of
nearly ten thousand over his oppo
nent, William Pitt Kellogg, and D. B.
Pcnn, Lieutenant Governor, by a ma
jority of fifteen thousand over his op
ponent, C. C. Antoine.
And whereas, by fraud and vio
lence, these defeated candidates seiz
ed the Executive chair.
And whereas, from time to time,
by other irregular, fraudulent, ahd
violent acts, in the face of the report
of the committee of the United States
Senate, appointed to investigate the
affairs of Louisiana, "That the exist
ing government of the State is a usur
pation, the result of violent abuse of
judicial functions, and sustained sim
ply by force," W. P. Kellogg has con
tinued himself in power, to the neat
