HEN Sary Jane died it
looked like there was
nothing for old man Da
vid Waters to do but to
“break up housekeepin’ ”
and live around with the
children. The loss of Sa
ry Jane had been a great
grief—had seemed almost
more than he could bear, but now to
leave the old home, to sever all the
hallowed associations, to go away
from the old church and the loved
and familiar places —all these things
that reminded him of Sary Jane and
the far-off, happy days when they had
been young and hopeful—seemed alto
gether too much.
He wanted to rent the farm to a
good family and live with them, but
no, the children would not listen to
this. The boys urged him to go and
live with them and said it would be
the joy of their lives to make their
father’s old age one of ease and con
tent. They lived in town. John was
rich and Jim was prominent and in
fluential.
Mary said if he stayed there she
never could go to sleep at night for
thinking about her poor old pa, away
off there by himself among strangers.
Lizzie declared that it would be a
shame, and she was not going to put
up with it, for she was president of
the Young Matrons* Club, and her
husband was going to run for Solici
tor at the next election.
John was the richest one of the
children and had the largest house, so
they arranged that their father should
make his home at John’s but divide
his time about equally among them
all.
And thev all did do their best to
make their father comfortable and
happy. His grandchildren adored
him. and to wait on him or have him
play with them was their greatest de
light. Mary lived in Florida and he
spent the winters with her.
But in spite of all the comforts and
all the leisure at his command, the
white-haired, red-faced old man was
not happy. He missed the musical
tinkle of the cow-bell and the welcome
song of the whippoorwill. He longed
to catch the odor of the tasseling corn
and the faint perfume of the cotton
blossoms. He would much rather
have got up at day break and gone
to hunt the calves than to lie in bed
two hours after sun up or get up and
sit on the piazza by himself. To go
for a ride or a walk late in the after
noon was not nearly so pleasant to
him as it would have been to take a
sack of corn and a bucket of slops
and go to feed the pigs.
There were two relics of the past,
however, which no amount of per
suasion could induce the old man Da
vid to give up —Nell, his old gray
mule, and his old-fashioned, half
worn-out buggy. The children had
insisted that he sell Nell and the ram
shackled, dilapidated buggy, and get
a nice little pony and a stylish-look
ing new buggy. But he remained
firm. Nell was the only companion
of the blessed past that was left him,
and he expected to keep her. The
buggy, he declared, was plenty good
enough for him and would likely last
as long as he did.
“Me’n Sary Jane,” he said, “has
rid in it a many a mile, an’ I’m a
gwine to ride in it to the end of the
journey.”
John’s fifteen-year-old daughter,
Kathleen, wept and said that it was
just too embarrassing to her for any
thing to see her grandfather riding
in such a looking turnout. But her
entreaties prevailed not and she had
to suffer and endure.
On Saturday before the fourth
Sunday in each month David went
back to his old home to attend church.
It was fifteen miles from John’s, but
he and Nell made the trip faithfully,
no matter how hot or how cold, how
wet or how dry the weather. David
was a Hardshell end he declared that
the “new-fangled town religion” his
children believed in did him no good.
It was at the big Hardshell Asso
ciation at Good Hope, his old church,
about two years after Sary Jane died,
that he saw Phebe Johnson.
For years and years William and
Phoebe Johnson had owned and lived
on the farm next to David’s and had
been the nearest neighbors and closest
friends of David and Sary Jane. But
five years ago Fred, their only child,
had persuaded them to move to Bruns
wick and live near him. William had
died three years ago, and since that
time Phoebe had lived with Fred and
had visited her old home and old
friends but once.
David and Phebe both spent Satur
day night at the home of their
friends and neighbors of the long ago
—'Sam and Nancy Hicks. Sam and
Nancy had quite a good many guests,
just as they always did from the Big-
Meetings and Associations at Good
Hope.
1 don’t know how it happened, but
that afternoon David and Phebe
found themselves seated at the south
ern end of the long, wide piazza that
extended the entire length of Sam’s
big log house, somewhat apart from
the other guests. “ Sister Polly Robi
son,” from “old Union” church in
Brooks, who had known Phebe, and
David too, when they were all chil
dren, had been with them and had
joined in the conversation for a while,
but she said, “If I don’t go and bathe
my side in some home-made liniment
I’ve got, I’ll not be able to go to
church tomorrow.” She was large
and tall and had the “rheumatiz,” so
she limped off and they were left
alone.
They talked for a long time. They
recalled the time when they were
children and had gone to school at
the little log school house with a dirt
floor, and of the “harricane” that
“blowed the top offen” the school
house one day. Then of the time, at
last, when they were grown —he a
young man and she a young woman.
“Phebe, do you recollect the fish fry
on Indian Greek that day when Lem
Hart stayed in the water too long
an’ got pow’ful bad off an’ we thought
he was a gwine to die?” asked
David.
“Yes, David,” said Phebe. “That
wus in the summer before me’n Wil
liam wus married the nex’ fall. We
wus both there. I remember Sary
Gbe Jeffersonian
Jane told me that day that she had
on a right new pair o’ shoes that her
pa’d just made her, an’ that they wus
a hurtin’ her foot, where she snagged
it the day before a pickin’ black ber
ries, pow’ful bad. An’ Lem Hart
hain’t never married?”
“No,” answered David, “he hain’t
never married yit. I seen him a
month ago when I come to meetin’.
He still lives on his farm down on
Indian Creek not fur from whur he
wus raised up.”
They spoke of the war —of that day
in the spring of ’6l when David and
William had marched away with the
first company of volunteers that had
hurried to the front from Berrien
County at President Davis’s first call
for troops —of the awful days that
followed when he and William had
suffered all the agonies and hard
ships of fighting and marching and
camping and starving—of the trials
and responsibilities that Phebe and
■Sary Jane had undergone at home,
and of the awful dread and suspense
that had aged them even more than
the incessant toil and privation, and
of that sad-joyous day at last when
the two soldiers had tottered home
with every hope shattered and nothing
left but life.
And they lived again those days
when health and hope had slowly re
turned, when they had somewhat re
covered their start in life and had
begun to prosper in spite of adversity.
They remembered each hallowed inci
dent that had marked the passing
years —the sickness, the deaths and
other sorrows that had come to the
two families and in which they had
been to each other friends and neigh
bors indeed. Sadly they recalled the
times when, one by one, the children
had all gone away and the old home
had seemed so still and voiceless.
Then came the saddest memory of
all when death had taken from each
of them their lifelong sweetheart —
their all in all of earth, and after that
they, too, had gone out into other
homes, and life had never seemed
quite right since.
The next morning when it was
time to go to church, *David went out
and hitched Nell to the buggy,
led her up to the yard fence and
threw the bridle rein over a post.
Then he went into the house, walked
to the water shelf where Phebe was
getting a drink of water and said,
“Phebe, you mought as well ride with
me to meetin’, bein’ as I’m by myself
an’ got plenty o’ room.”
Phebe was startled and looked like
she thought she ought to apologize
to the whole world for doing it, but
she said she would. She wore a black
dress and bonnet and her brown eyes
and wavy, half-gray hair betokened
the beauty that had once been hers.
As Nell patiently made her way
toward Good Hope church David said,
“Phebe, I’ve been a studyin’ a right
smart about my condition an’ yourn
since last night. We ain’t nairy one
happy an’ hit looks to me like we’d
be better off to git together an’ have
somers of our own to stay at. I hain’t
never sold my place an’ if you’re
willin’ we can git married an’ live
there an’ be here close to our church
an’ the graveyard. Now, I ain’t
a-sayin’ that I love you like I loved
Sary Jane, an’ I ain’t a astin’ you
to love me like you loved William,
but bein’ as we air by ourselves an’
hain’t got no pertic’lar home I think
we’d be better satisfied to git together
an’ have a home o’ our own.”
Phebe was thoroughly surprised.
She-sat very still and quiet for a mo
ment and then half-hesitatingly said,
“I ’spect we would be, David.”
When David and Phebe reached the
church they did not go and sit down
together under the arbor after the
manner of most engaged couples, but
while David was unhitching Nell from
the buggy, Phebe got out and went
on with Sister Polly Robison as she
came by on her way to the arbor.
When David had hitched Nell to a
pine sapling, he went and sat down
on the other side of the “stand.”
David knew a man at church who
lived in town and was going home
that night, but coming back next day,
so David sent by him for the license.
‘ ‘ Gracious mercy! ’ ’ exclaimed
Nancy Hicks Monday just after din
ner when Phebe told her about it—•
“I never wus so surprised in my
life.” And she never had been, for
she had not thought it possible that
anybody she knew could marry unless
she helped to make the match. But
she had been so? busy preparing for
the Association, entertaining com
pany, and looking- after the cooking
that she had not even thought of
getting- up a love affair between these
two friends of hers.
“I might a knowed that wus how
come Preacher Huggins to come home
with us,” she continued. “I ast’
him yisterday to ome today an’ he
said he wus a-gwine home with old
Sister Mary Ann Kelley today. But
I don’t blame you a bit, for you’ll
both be a sight contenteder an’ better
off.”
And when I saw them one shining,
hot Sunday in June on their way to
Hardshell baptizing behind faithful,
plodding Nell, Phebe holding the big
umbrella and looking out with placid,
calm eyes from the depths of her bon
net, and David’s face all hale and red
and smiling, covered half with flowing
white beard beneath his broad
brimmed black hat, I knew that they
had not been disappointed in their
expectations of happiness and that
when Nancy Hicks had said, “You’ll
both be a sight contenteder an’ better
off,” she had uttered a prophecy.
IMMIGRATION.
The Cleveland Leader, in an edito
rial, attempts to show by the increas
ing number of immigrants arriving at
New York, that times are getting bet
ter. The Leader says: “Last week
22,724 immigrants landed in New
York. * * * So far this year the
steerage passengers landed at New
York have been 53,142 in excess of
the number who sailed from that
city.” This is a ghostly array of sta
tistics when we consider that foreign
ers come in “free of duty,” and that
every mother’s son of them comes in
direct competition with a hungry
American who has been jobless and
starving for more than a year.—The
