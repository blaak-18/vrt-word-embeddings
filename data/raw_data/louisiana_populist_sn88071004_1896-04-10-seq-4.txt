That
Extreme tired feeling afficts nearly every
body at this season. The hustlers cease to
push, the tireless grow weary, the ener
getic become enervated. You know just
What we mean. Some men and women
emdeavor temporarily to overcome that
Tired
Feeling by great force of will. But this
is unsafe, as it pulls powerfully upon the
nervous system, which will not long stand
such strain. Too many people " work on
their nerves," and the result is seen in un
fortunate wrecks marked "nervous pros
tration," in every direction. That tired
Feel
ing is a positive proof of thin, weak, im
pure blood; for, if the blood is rich, red,
vitalized and vigorous, it imparts life and
energy to every nerve, organ and tissue
of the body. The necessity of taking
Hood's Sarsaparilla for that tired feeling
is, therefore, apparent to every one, and
the good it will do you is equally beyond
question. Remember that

There are a great many drawbaoks
to being a queen, aside from the dim
culty of getting a steady job in any
reliable government. There are so
many things they can't do, and, of
course, they are the nice things one
would like to do. For instance, Queen
Victoria can't read a newspaper in the
plain, plebeian way it comes from the
press. All she gets is an expurgated
edition, which is cut into little slips.
A court official reads the paper and
cuts out what he thinks will interest
the queen, and pins these clippings on
silk ribbon, as if anybody would care
for a silk newspaper. In this way the
poor queen never gets to read the ad
vertisements of bargains and marked
down sales, and, like as not, even the
divorce cases, or even to see what the
opposition papers say about her. It is
safe to say that nobody, queen or
commoner, wants anybody else to pick
out for her what is interesting in the
daily paper. It is like having some
one else skim all the cream off the
milk.
Still Advanelng.
Still another decisive step in the
progress of discovery of the adapta
bility of the remarkable new Roentgen
light must be chronicled. Two well
known Toronto university professors
are reported to have found out a
method of so focusing the cathode rays
by means of a glass bell jar as to
secure instantaneous photographs by
the new process. This knowledge is
necessary in order to induce any wide
application of the light to practical
purposes, and confirmation of this re
port will be more eagerly awaited than
in the case of its many sister rumors.

John Barton Payne proposes to limit

value is very small. In the east end
there are several establishments where
> such horses and mules to match are

I if the animal is not able to earn its oats. 1
Last week a well-known hackdriver de- i

beast to an east end auctioneer with in- I

A Foreign Visitor.
Mr. L. J. Jerrett, who represents a
large Parisian shoe manufacturing
company, has been making a tour
throuirh this country to acquaint him
self thoroughly w:thl American meth
ods of shoe making. lHe has visited
all the large shoe muanufacturing cen
ters in the east, and believes that his
trip has been very protitable. lie
states that American shoe making
methods are very far in advance of
those employed in France, and he will
buy a full line of American shoe ma
chines before rt urning to his country.
The last city that he visited was St.
Louis, to which place he was attracted
by the far-reaching reputation of the
l'c :t.yers Shoe Co., whose shoes he
had lh.ari of before comining to this
country, lie spent quite a time in
their factory, and believes that their
methods of making shoe. are superior
to any that he has sefen in the country,
and he has arranged to copy them on
his return to France. In an interview
with a re:orter he stated, that after
spending s'vert:l days with the above
mentioned firm. lie was hiot at all sur
prised that they shoulld tinI such a
ready market for their goods all over

Poets
Break Out...
in the Springtime. And a
great many who are not
poets, pay tribute to the
season in the same way.
The difference is that the
poet breaks out in about
the same spot annually,
while more prosaic people
break out in various parts
of the body. It's natural.
Spring is the breaking
out season. It is the time
when impurities of the
blood work to the surface.
It is the time, therefore, to
take the purest and most
powerful blood purifier,
