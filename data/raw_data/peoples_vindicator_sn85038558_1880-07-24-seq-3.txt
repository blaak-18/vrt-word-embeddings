Republican party because of that act,
and because it justified and sustained it.
After such an act I have no desire to sus
tain the Republican party in any way.
I would not vote for a party that world
carry through such a frand. I thinl Mr.
layes was elected by a fraud, and I do
not mean to have it said that at the next
electio:l I had forgotten it. I do not say
that Mr. Hayes committed the fraud, but
it was committed by his party. I have
no enmity to Mr. Hayes, but after the
fraud by which he became Preaident I
could not vote for any person put up for
President. odi the Republican side who
did not disavow the fraud committed. I
would not support any member of that
party who had any sort of mixture with
that fraud. Ifeel that the counting out
isjust as much a fraud now as at the time
it was perpetrated.-Charles Francis
