Chantilly is the game-preserve of i

is ordered for the chase. Those wide
open glassy glades, studded with birch
or oaksorub, are haunted by the deer,
and in those thickets of golden broom
the heavy does prepare their nurseries.
Great, floundering, russet pheasants
some flying by; at every step a hare or
s white-tailed rabbit starts up out of
the grass. At the further end of the
forest there are deep, unsightly thick
ets of mud and thorn, left darkling
smid the trim order of, the place, for
the wild boar delights in them. As we
walk or drive down the neat-clipt ave
nues of the forest the roads appear im
passable to the traveler, andwe won
lier at the contrast between their shoals
3f sand and the careful forestry that
pares anf cuts every wilding branch of
the over-arching horn-beam roof. But
the roads are bad on purpose; every
spring they are plowed afresh, lest they
lose the lightness beloved of the horse
man.
Every May a beautiful fault frus
trates this skillful venery, for, thick as
grass, thick and sweet, the lily of the
valley springs, in all the brakes and
shady places. The scent of the game
will not lie across these miles of blos
som. The hunters are in despair and
the deer, still deafened with the win
ter's yelp of the hounds-the deer, who
sets his back against the sturdiest oak
and butts at the pack with his antlers,
who swims the lakes and from his
island refuge sells his life as hard as
he can-the deer, accustomed to be al
ways vanquished, beholds himself at
last befriended by an ally more in
vincible than water or forest oak, bjr
the sweet, innumerable white lily, in
nocent as himself, that every Maytinme
sends the huntsmen home.
The lily that saves the deer is the
consolation of poor women. Every
morhing during the brief season of its
blossom they are up before the dawn.
Holding their children by the hand,
they are off to the innermost dells of

Eleven men in buckram suite! Does it
follow that every man with an oleangin
ons corporosity is given to seeing double
and treble like Jack Falstaff? Dr. Hint
er Cooper, of Atlanta, came here the other
day with his friend, Murphy Candler.
They have been fishiig all over the State
and wound up at Clear Water. They came
from St. Petersburg last and the doctor
alarmed us about the horrible sawfish
that he helped to catch there at the end
of the .wharf. He got excited with his
narrative as he told how, when the mon
ster was hooked, the alarm was given and
every man and boy in town ran down to
see. and after the fishermen had tangled
ropes and log chains all over it it took
every able-bodied man in town to draw it
to shl;re. "It actually weighed," said he,
"over rO5 pounds and its saw was the
most veonomous weapon I ever beheld. It
had been broken off a foot or two, but
what was left measured five feet and
eight inches." "Oh, mercy," said my
wife, "isent it awful. Girls, you must not
go in bathing any more. Every day some
body would tell about these awful crea
tures-dervil fish and sharks and sting
arees and sawlish. It is a wonder they
have not got asome of us before now."
Dr. Cooper is a first-class gentleman
and came from good, old Baptist stock.
He stands high itn his profession and in
his stockings, and is handsome and he
knows it. ,but I noticed that every time he
told a big yarn he appealed to Murphy for
confirmation. "Isent it so. Murph? You
saw that fish. I pledge you my word it
was the biggest monster I ever laid my
eyes on." "35Murph" simply nodded assent
as the doctor branched off on another
narrative. Murphy is a Presbyterian and
his official position in the Agnes Scott in
stitute is ever before him,- but still he
would not go back on his friends. es
pecially when so far away from home.
He affectionately calls the doctor "Hunt,"
and the doctor calls him ".Mrph," and
they coinctide on everything except that
31urph says Hunt plays too much croquet
with the pretty girls along the route.
and sometimttes they mliss a train by it.
which is v'ery ptrovoking. And Hutt said
that whlen ptrerty girls pursue a man it
is very had itanlnel to run away from
them.
MIy wife- rcjuarked that ntight after we
retired that shi' liked them both very
tilch, very -itlc-lh, indeed, and after a
pause she saitl it would be a right good
I':w if every handsoiLu e married man when
hr--wentl for away frontll lornu should have
to wt'ar a ribbon, onl his hat with "'family
mlan" printed on it. just as a warning to
foolish girls, you know. 1 diclent answer,
but sltoredi a little as if I heard her not.
But still I diclent altogether discredit the
sawfish story. The doctor's appeals to
Murlphy were only a cir cumstance-a
badge of fraud, as tilt lawyers say. Nev
ertheless I was jealous of St. Peters
burg.
I diclent like to have Clear Water out
done in anything-not even in monsters.
and so the next dlay I took partieultr no
tice of the doctor a hIe was fishing in the
pass. I diagnosed him. He began to play
the seven men n ltucl;ratnn suits. The
first repitable trout he caught he declared
to be a six-pounder and tried to prove it
by our hone,tst Swede. Witmnore. "Na.
na," said 1Witmore. "dat vasth vay no
more as tree pounds, but he is a vine
rish." Dr. ('onper quarreled hint- out of
:another poulind, and so they fussed about
evrcxy fish until Mr. TWitluore surrendered,
and when the doctor caught a ten-pouundter
the Swede said. "Dot iush vay more fdan
any ten pounds--hei is a fifteen-pound
vish, certain."
This suited the doctor's turn exa:ctly,
and that night he was gushing in his
praise of the honest Stifede. I hleard thtt
he overpaid hint for for his hbot and nmade
him keep it. Our cottage girls were out
with thetm that day and they aill had glo
rious sport. They caught several hun
dIred poutids of fine :sh. Our youngster
-aught the largest groulper. It w-eighed
thirty-seven pounds and was three feet
Iong. The doctor and MIr. Candler strung
the four largest on an oar and toted therm
from the dock lip to the town and the
load made them wriggle andi twist -their
legs like drunken men to the great amuse
ment of the people. They left their bur
den on the plank walk and I had to hire
a wagon to haul thlent away. After a
glorious fish sulpper they spent the even
ing with ius recolutinlg the sueal'sstes of
the day. and both declared it was the
heost tlny they had had in Florida.
On parting the ldoctor said in sotto voce.
"Now. MInjar. when you, in your letters

I amn--nothing extculiate. Inut .st it all

"And what is friendahip but a name
A charm that trills to sleep.

But leaves a wretch to weep."
That is not so. Thalnt was but the lttor

is a sweet. Favory reulity, and next to the
lde:rest tie on earth. There are not

made frietnds from whom we part not
willingly, for they have been kind and
have done so luuch to make our prolonged
visit pleasant. This is a happy little
town.
I was sitting in my daughter's pretty
little veranda this evening and counted
sir squirrels in the trees near by. I saw
a pair of quails and two rabbits in the
street as I approached the dwelling. Col.
lFrazer lives right opposite, and fhere was
an owl sitting quietly on a limb near his
veranda. A tail, venerable crane was
wading in the water at the foot of the
bluff. "This solitary bird is nearly al
ways there." said the colonel. "and when
he straightens up full length looks as
solemn as a Presbyterian preacher." No
hody dares to distutrh these pets in Clear
`ater, for it is ngainst the law. Clear
Water is certainly a peaceful little vil
ittre, for there has jiot beeni a fight nor a
Ii'.'rrcl sine. we have been here. Indleed,
‚Ä¢1,..t are,,good people here who favor giv
'ng up the town charter, because the ray
or and Marshal have nothing to do. But
the Tampa railroad is coming very soon,
and Tampa. whisky will find its way, -and
maybe the Mayor and Marshal will both
find business. Railroads are great bless
ings, but every good thing has some bad
mixed up with it, and Clear Water will
not escape.
In less than six months I expect to be
here again, and Mr. Jones says I shall
ride on the new road if I come by Tampa.
In the meantime, I will be at home in
Cartersvllle, and be pleased to answer
any letters about property in Clear Water.
I have already found winter homes for
several and will be glad to plant some
more. Bill Arp

-In answer to a correspondent the
Electrical Review states that the two
basic patents on the telephone, involv
ing the method of magneto transmis
sion and the magneto receiver, have
expired, and consequently any one is
free to use the telephone to that ex
tent For long-distance swork, howev
er, the telephone business is not open
to free public use. The American Bell
Telephone Co. owns a patent issued to
Emile Berliner, November 17, 18l1,
which covers the familiar form of car
bon transmitter Such a transmitter
has always been employed in long dis
tance ivork. The magneto as ordina
rily constructed has not sufficient pow
er to transverse long distances and
give commercial talk. Some modern
types of magneto instruments have
been devised which seem to possess the
qualities for long distance use, but
such instruments are the exception and
not the rule. The Berliner patent may
be declared invalid, but until it is, it

-In 18S the entire electric railway
mileage in the United States was only
about 4S, distributed over eight states.
At the close of last year the electric
railways comprised 61 per cent. of the
entire street railway system of the
United States, this gain being at the
expense of the horse and steam lines
The past year the mileage operated by
horse power decreased from 4,463 to
3,407 miles and that by steam 640 to 5;(1
The total street railway mileage in
creased 1,640, but the electrical rail
way mileage increased 1,517 miles,
showing an extensive conversion of
horse line into electric. About one
quarter of the mileage of the horse
railways in the United States a year
ago has been fitted for electricity.
The cable railways increased only
twelve miles during the year, thus
proving it is cheaper and more satis
factory to operate by electricity than
any other system, and in the near fu
ture, it is predicted, this system will
be a formidable competitor of the
steam railways for suburban traffic.
-The WVashington convention of the
National Blectric Light association
among other questions, paid a good
deal of attention to that of wiring, and
adopted a new set of rules in regard to
the matter. It appears, however, that
these rules conflict in several import
ant details with those of the Under
writers' International Electric associa
tion. This want of uniformity in the
two sets of rules is greatly deplored by
those in interest. The Architects'
Electrical Bulletin of New York, com
menting on this conflict of authority,
says: "It seems to us the best way to
get concurrent and accordant action
would be to resort to a conference, in
which all the regulating authorities
would be represented and at which
some universal agreement could be ar
rived at As it is, we have had the
spectacle of the National Electric Light
association copyrighting its new rules,
avowedly because various irnsurance
bodies steal and plagarize the rules,
and spoil them in the process, beside
inflicting serious hardships and inju
ries on the art. Now all this is to be
deeply regretted, especially as it should
be easily avoidable."
IT STUCK IN THE AIr.
An Actor in Wiillina Tell" Astonished at
lHis Own Perfornmance.
I remember seeing once, at a German
theater, a performance of the drama
"'William Tell" I was told by the
manager of the theater that the stage
effects in the play were extremely fine,
and that I was to wait until the scene
where Tell's splendid marksmanship
was made apparent to see something
that would astonish me. I did wait as
patiently as I could until that scene,
and I was certainly astonished.
The scene arrived where Tell was to
shoot the apple from his son's devoted
head. As I gathiered from the eloquent
occurrence, the apple andl Tell's cross
bow were connected by an invisible
wire, along which the arrow was'to
speed to the target.
At the proper cue the arrcw did
speed half way toward the apple and
there stuck, to all appearance, in mid
air! In vain did the doughty Tell
shake his bow to "joggle" the arrow to
its mark. The son of Tell looked very
frightened, and didn't know what was
happening.
The apple firmly fixed on his youth
ful cranium was bobbing about, the
audience was laughing, and the laugh
burst intr, a roar when one of Gessler's
guards took in the situation, and com
ing forward from his position at the
side of young Tell, calmly gave the re
calcitrant arrow a smart rap with his
spear, when it sped on its way and bur
led itself in the apple on the boy's
head.-ePcarson's Weekly'.
