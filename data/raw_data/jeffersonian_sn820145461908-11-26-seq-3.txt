A Thanksgiving in Self-Defense
DA HORTON laid aside
the magazine she had
been reading, and looked
thoughtfully out upon the
dismal, drizzly world for
a moment. Then she said
to herself, “Yes, I am
going to do it, but I
shall not be hypocrite
enough to pretend that I am doing
it because I am good or thankful or
pious. I am so miserable that I
must do something to keep from go
ing crazy, so I am going to prepare
a nice Thanksgiving dinner for papa
and me and while I am doing that I
am going to cook enough to send a
basketful to old Uncle Ike and Aunt
Cindy, and one to the widow Carter
and her 'hungry children. I wonder
how it will seem to be a philanthrop- ■
ist, or a Lady Bountiful, or whatever
they call it? But I want it distinct
ly understood that I am doing it in
self-defense and not because I am
sorry for them or patient or meek or
resigned. I am sure they are every
one happier than I am. Do you un
derstand that, Tab?” she said as she
stood up and gave the sleeping cat
a vigorous poke with the toe of her
slipper.
Tab did not understand that, but
he understood that he had been dis
turbed, so he got up, stretched himself
and lay down on the rug by the dress
er.
And then Ada put a piece of wood
on the fire, so it would last until her
father came in, and went to the kitch
en to execut'✓ her newly-made plans,
for tomorrow would be Thanksgiving
Day.
Ada Horton was tall, graceful,
womanly and well educated. She had
a wealth of dark, reddish-brown hair
which she arranged handsomely on
top of her head. Her complexion
was a fine creamy white and her eyes
were large and brown. She was
twenty-six and, as she said, misera
ble. Os a restless, energetic, intel
lectual temperament, the isolation
and loneliness of life on her father’s
big plantation sometimes became al
most unbearable, and her restless, am
bitious spirit was forever rebelling at
the lack of companionship, congenial
ity and activity. Her duties as
housekeeper for her father kept her
busy enough but it wasn’t what she
wanted to do and the monotony al
most tortured her.
Her brother Charlie often urged
their father to sell his farm and
move to town. Ada sincerely wished
that he would and sometimes insisted
that he should. But he would not.
He declared he could never be happy
anywhere else. No other place in the
world could ever be so dear to him as
his farm —the home of his strong,
active manhood —the place where he
had reared his family and won suc
cess from the earth. Then, too, he
was too old to take up any other
work, but still strong enough to look
after his farm, and he must do some
thing. Idleness would be torture to
him.
Ada knew that what he said was
true, and she did not blame him, for
she loved the splendid country home
with its broad fields and glorious sun-

sets in spite of her loneliness. To go
would be as great a sacrifice for her
father as to stay would be for her,
and she might as well make it as for
him to do so. She sometimes told
herself, though, that she should have
to make it rebelliously—that she nev
er could do it contentedly.
But Ada was not miserable all the
time. The fine optimism and com
mon sense of her nature usually dom
inated the tendency to depression and
despondency. It was only occasion
ally that she gave way. to a “spell
of the blues.” As a rule, she was
cheerful, sensible, sunny and disposed
to make the best of whatever situa
tion she had to face. She devoted
much of her leisure time to reading
and music. She felt a sympathetic
interest in the tenants on her father’s
farm, and they were the recipients of
many kindnesses from her.
People wondered why Ada did not
marry. Her friends —those who knew
her intimately —said that they did not
believe she wanted to, and they could
not understand why it was so. Others,
judging by themselves, took it for
granted that everybody would marry
if they could, and said she had never
had a chance.
When Ada thought about it, she re
membered a handsome, manly man
with light brown hair, a fine, clear
cut face and a pair of wonderful grey
eyes that had looked into hers one
day, and she wondered why she could
never forget. Why did that memory
forever haunt her?
As she sat, dreaming of the past,
before the fire this morning, she re
called the day before Thanksgiving
seven years ago when she had first
seen Eugene Nelson. It was on the
train as she was coming home from
school to spend Thanksgiving Day.
She was looking at the handsome
young man on the seat just across the
aisle and wondering who he was when
he turned and looked at her and
wondered who she, the pretty girl in
the jaunty uniform, was. Their eyes
met, and Ada blushed and turned to
look out of the window.
She was surprised, when the train
reached Wilton, to see that he stop
ped there, too. She almost forgot to
think about him in the joy of meeting
her father, but as they were going to
the buggy she heard somebody say,
“That’s the new doctor that’s come
to Wilton.”
When Ada came home for the
Christmas holidays she spent two
days in town with Madge Overly, and
at an entertainment one night she met
Pr. Nelson. He said he already
knew her, and she felt like she had
always known him.
The next June Ada graduated and
came home, a happy, dreamy, light
hearted girl.
Dr. Nelson was waiting to meet her
at the train, and during the bright,
summer days that followed he very
often found time to drive over the
four miles from Wilton to her home
and take her out riding, to a picnic,
or a “big meeting.” How manly,
how courteous, how attentive he had
XSije 3&f?ersonlan
been! How bright, how sweet, how
complete life had seemed to her that
summer!
Then suddenly, without a word to
her, he went away and she had never
heard from him since.
Ada sometimes told herself that she
was foolish —that he had never really
cared for her, but she could never
quite convince herself that that was
true. He had never really told her
so, but she was a woman and she
knew. She sometimes thought that if
she had never known him, or if he
had died, this loneliness would not
hurt her so. Anything but this
vague uncertainty—this haunting
memory of something she had missed
that ought to have been hers.
Her mother died the next winter
after she came home from college and
since that time she and her father
had lived by themselves.
Ada had had several offers of mar
riage during those seven years, or
rather, she could have had. But she
was not a coquette, and she was too
tactful and womanly to let a man she
did not intend to accept get quite to
the proposing point. She miglit do
some things she did not want to do,
but it would not be to marry a man
she did not love. No. She w r ould
be true to her womanly ideal no mat
ter how miserable she became.
Thanksgiving Day dawned clear
and bright and rather cold. Ada rose
early, decorated the house with chry
santhemums, and cooked her Thanks
giving dinner. She arranged the part
intended for herself and her father
on the range so that it would stay
hot. With the rest she filled two
baskets, and with each basket went
a lovely bouquet of chrysanthemums.
She called Bill, the colored boy, to
carry the baskets for her, and started
out. They came first to Uncle Ike’s
cabin. He was out getting q “turn”
of wood, but Aunt Cindy thanked
and blessed her profusely.
“I des tole Ike dis mawnin’ I done
feel des lak de Lawd gwinter sen’ us
some kind ob a blessin’ terday, an’
sho nuff hit done come. Bless de
honey chile!”
“Oh, go ’long and eat your dinner,
Aunt Cindy!” laughed Ada. “I’m
no ‘honey chile,’ and I don’t deserve
any blessing for that dinner.”
Ada found the widow Carter card
ing “bats” because she had the
“rheumatiz” in her hip so bad she
couldn’t walk. Dot and Tony were
roasting potatoes in the fireplace and
Ben and Fanny, the two older chil
dren, were picking cotton.
“Miss Ada, you shorely air the
Lord’s own angel!” exclaimed Mrs.
Carter when Ada explained her visit.
“The Lord will provide, an’ I told
the children so las’ week when our
old rooster what we wus a savin ’ for
Thanksgivin ’ turk sick an’ died.
Tony said, though, he wusn’t expect
in’ nothin’ but bacon an’ ’taters for
his Thanksgivin’ dinner an’ it wus be
ginnin’ to look that a-way, but here
it is in plenty time. God bless you.”
As Ada hurried home along the
bright sunshiny road under the dark
green pine trees, her heart and spir
its expanded to the beauty of the
glorious day and she exclaimed,

Financial Depressions
Periodical financial depressions distress
the country. We call them inevitable; are
they? Is there no cure? Is not the debtor
—many simply in panic to pay the creditor
—few?
The Remedy
is given In “Usury; from a Scriptural, Eth
ical and Economic Standpoint,” in which
great book, for the first time in years, logic,
religion, theory and practice are so united
as to demonstrate convincingly that
Usury
Is the cause of our recent and every finan
cial distress. The author, Rev. J. C. Elli
ott, strikes heavy blows on present systems.
Interest is the curse of business morality
and business practice.
