VINEGAR BITTERS
f»rat «'fui Thousands proclaim
7i\e<;ai: Bitters the most wonder
ful Invigorant that ever sustained
the sinking system.
No Person rail take these Hit
ters according to directions, and re- .
main long unwell, provided their
bones are not destroyed by mineral
poison or other means, and vital or
gans wasted beyond repair.
Bilious, Remittent, and In*
term il tent Fevers, which are so
prevalent in the valleys of our great
rivers throughout the United States,
especially those of the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, Arkansas, Red, Colo
rado, lira/.«>s. Kin (jrande. Pearl,
Alabama. Mobile. Savannah. Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during iho
.Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, aie invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purposo
equal to I )it. J. Wai.kkk's Vinkcak
kitt Kits, as tliey will speedily remove
tlit- dark-colorcd viscid matter with wliielt
the bowels are loaded, at the same tiiuo
Miimiliiting the secretions of tlie liver,
ami generally restoring the healthy func
tions of the digestive organs.
Fortify the body agniitst dis
ease by purifying all its fluids with
VixKOAit hittkhs . No epidemic can
take hold of a system thus fnre-ariiied.
Dyspepsia or Indigestion, iiead
aeliif. I'ain in the Shoulders. Coughs.
Tiglitne.-s of the Chest. Dizziness, Sour
Kructations of the Stomach. Kail Taste
in the Mouth, bilious Attacks. Palpita
tion of the Heart. Inflammation of the
Lungs. I'ain in the region of the Kidr.eys,
and a hundred other painful symptoms,
are the offsprings of Dyspepsia. One bot
tle will prove a better guarantee of its
merits than a lengthy advertisement.
Scrofula, or king's Evil, White
Swellings. Ulcers, Erysinela*. Swelled
Neck, (ioitre. Scrofulous Inflammations,
Indolent Inflammations. Mercurial affec
tions. Old Sores, irruptions of the Skin,
Sore Eyes. etc. In these, as in all other
constitutional Diseases, walk Kit's Vts
koa r k ittrkk have rhown their great cur
ative powers in the most obstinate and
intractable cases.
For 1 ii lia m mat oi'3* and Chronic
Rheumatism, Gmit, bilious, Remit
tent and Intermittent Fevers. Diseases
of the blood. Liver. Kidneys and bladder,
these bitters have no equal. Such Dis
eases are caused by Vitiated blood.
Mechanical Diseases.—Persons
engaged in Paints and Minerals, such as
Plumbers. Type-setters, Gold-beaters and
Miners, as they advance in life, are sub
ject to paralysis of the bowels. To guard
against this*, take a dose of walkkk's
V iNKii.ut brri KKs occasionally.
For. Skin Diseases, Eruptions,
Tetter. Salt-Rheum. blotches. Spots. Pim
ples. Pustules, boils, Carbuncles, King
worms. Scald-head. Sore Kyes. Erysipe
las. Itch. Scurfs. Discolorations of the
Skin. Humors and Diseases of the Skiu of
whatever name or nature, are literally
dug up and carried out of the system in a
short time by the use ôf these bitters.
Tin, Tape, and other Worms,
lurking in the system of so many thou
sands. are elfectually destroyed aud re
moved. No system of medicine, no ver
mifuges. no anthelmintics will free the
«•stem from worms like these bitters.
For Female Complaints, in young
or old. married or single, at the dawn of
womanhood, or the turn of life, these Ton
ic Bitters display so decided all influence
that improvement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated lllood
whenever you tind its impurities bursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores ; cleanse it when you find it ob
structed and sluggish in the veins; cleanse
it when it is foul ; your feelings will tell
vou when. Keep the blood Dure, aud the
health of the svstem will follow.
