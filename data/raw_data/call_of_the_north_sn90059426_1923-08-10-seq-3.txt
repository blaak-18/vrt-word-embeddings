JESUS of NAZARETH
DELIVERED AT THE PEOPLES AUDITORIUM. ST. PAUL,
WEDNESDAY EVENING. AUGUST Ist.
In Matthew 28:18, it is written:
“All power is given unto me in heav
en and in earth.” An announcement
attributed to Jesus of Nazareth, just
prior to His ascension—quoted, not
as proof of anything, but merely as
a starting point. I never discuss in
public address, or in print, things I
know nothing about. I know nothing
whatever about the authority Jesus
exercises in Heaven. Therefore the
first part of the text is at once elim
inated. I know about his authority
on earth, and it is upon his earthly
authority that I shall endeavor to
rivet your attention this evening.
The usual book or sermon on the
Deity of Jesus appeals to, and rests
its case upon, the Scriptures. From
my view-point, this method, which
insists, without argument, that the
Bible is the inerrent word of God, is
subject to adverse criticism, if not to
ridicule. It may be that the man to
whom you are talking regards the
Bible as a bundle of improbable
stories. Why quote the Bible to
him ? Before you quote the Bible
to him in proof of anything, you
must prove to him that the Bible is
a book of authority. Perhaps your
auditor or reader is a self-styled
modernist, who says, with an I-know
it-all air, that the inspiration which
gave us the Bible was what we now
call human genius, and that therefore
the Bible is inspired just, and only,
as Shakespeare and Milton are in
spired. Why quote the Bible to him?
His supreme need is a lecture on the
integrity of the Bible. All who ac
cept the Bible as the word of God
must necessarily recognize the Deity
of Jesus which is the major theme
of the Bible, and all who regard the
Bible as a collection of uninspired
literature will look ascant at quota
tions from the Bible to prove the
Deity of Jesus. I shall therefore
close the Bible just here, lay it to one
side and ignore it utterly, as though
it were not in existence, while en
deavoring to answer the age-long
question: “Was Jesus of Nazareth
more than man?”
No Tedious Translations
If any of you came this evening
anticipating a discourse filled with
tedious translations and hair-splitting
arguments, you will go away disap
pointed. The microscope is not my
hobby. I revel in the midst of
things that Can be seen with the
naked eye. I shall therefore em
phasize a few things this evening
that are on the surface, facts that
none can question and with which all
are familiar. You can argue with a
theory, but you cannot argue a fact.
A fact is the greatest, and the most
powerful, thing on earth. You can
question a theory of light, but you
cannot question a ray of light—it is
a fact which you must admit. You
may have your own ideas about a
theory of gravitation, but the fact
that an object thrown up must come
down is outside the pale of debate.
If you engage in battle with a fact,
it will deal you a solar plexus blow
instanter. Without further explana
tion, the facts to which I shall call
your attention this evening are in
controvertible, no matter what the
reasoning to account for them.
First of all, the fact that Jesus
lived is necessary, nor need we ap
peal to the Bible to establish it.
Secondary evidence that Jesus lived
is abundant, but it may all be cast
aside for the reason that it is de
batablel, and likewise for the Teason
that it is not needed. Early writers,
such as Clement, Justin, Pliny, Seu
tonius and Tacitus, could be called
to the witness stand; but, although
they lived in the early morning of
the Christian Era, their testimony
might be regarded as traditional,
hence we shall ignore them.
The passage in Josephus, which
stands like a- stone wall across the
path of the extensively paraded new
theology, reads, as Professor Case of
the University of. Chicago prefers to
put it in his “Histrocity of Jesus,” as
follows:
“At this time lived Jesus, a wise
man, if indeed it is proper to call him
a man. For he was a doer of won
derful works, a teacher of men who
receive the truth gladly, and he won
to himself both many Jews and many
Greeks. This was the Christ. And
when Pilate, on the indictment «l Ik*
chief men among us, —ntsnosd Mm
to crucifixion, those who loved him
By DR. GEO.’ P. RUTLEDGE -

at first did not cease loving him; for
he appeared to them alive again the
third day, aa indeed the divine proph
ets had foretold these and ten thou
sand other wonders concerning him.
And even to this day the race of
Christians named from him is not
extinct.”
In vain have atheists, infidels and
new theology folk endeavored to ex
plain away the testimony of Josephus.
The exaggerations possible in the
Slavonic version of Josephus are
made the basis of attack upon the
passage, and, with Eusebius brushed
aside, Origen is brought forward to
announce that in his opinion the
statement, “This was the Christ,”
should read: “This was the so-called
Christ.” With Origen, Goethals,
Weiss and others, who have written
upon the subject, agree. They are
perfectly willing for Josephus to tes
tify that Jesus lived, but to let
Josephus testify that Jesus was the
Christ and a miracle worker—never!
Let it go at that. Personally, I
accept the miracles attributed to
Jesus by both Josephus and the New
Testament, but I shall not offer them
as evidence in this discussion. If
my contention that Jesus of Nazareth
was, and is, more than man cannot
stand without an appeal to the Virgin
Birth, the feeding of the multitudes,
the quelling of the storm, the healing
of the sick, the raising of the dead,
and the bodily resurrection, let it
fall. Strip the references in Josephus
to Jesus of the miraculous, and cut
out the phrase, “The Christ,” entire
ly. I do not wish to prove by
Josephus that Jesus was the Christ,
or that he was in any sense divine.
Let Josephus testify to only ■ one
thing, the fact that Jesus lived. This
is all that is necessary. It may be
remarked, just here, that men of
scholarly attainment today do not
risk their reputation in argument
against the historicity of Jesus.
They all, without exception, accept
Jesus of Nazareth as a fact, although
many of them endeavor to explain
away his Deity..
In his lecture, “The Ethics of Jesus
of Nazareth,” Dr. Lyman Abbott af
firmed that the young man from Naz
areth, being familiar with the Old
Testament prophecies and the Jewish
hope, decided to be the Messiah. The
meaning of this is quite clear—the
young Nazarene, a mere man, follow
ed' a self-developed vision. In this
sweeping statement, the distinguished
editor of the “Outook” mirrored the
entire modernistic view-point. It
has been said that there is a reason
for everything. The way must be
paved for the theory of evolution, at
all hazards. Every scientist knows,
and will admit, that if a single mir
acle in all history stands, the theory
of evolution must fall. Hence, the
strenuous effort in certain circles to
eliminate the Deity of Jesus. In new
theology literature, Jesus of Naz
areth, admitted as a fact,, is re
presented as a man, and only a man,
who followed a fine vision and uttered
great truths, and who, therefore,
should be classed with the world’s
great teachers. This is the compli
ment they are forced to pay Him.
And be it remembered that among
the leading lights in the school which
thus disposes of Jesus of Nazareth,
are such men as Welhausen, Strauss,
Ewald, Kuehne, Hitzig and Renan—*
all said to be Jews. Think of it! A
Jewish ultimatum concerning Jesus
of Nazareth, heralded from numerous
Christian pulpits and Bible Chain in
Christian Colleges sad through some
Christian journals. What strange
bedfellows the New Theoogy makes 1
It is generally conceded that Jesus
of Nazareth enjoyed no superior edu
cational advantages, that he traveled
in a limited territory, no larger than
a Texas county, and that he died
young, at an age when the average,
man is still casting about for hia
field of life activities. It is positive
ly known that if he left any writ
ing, it was not preserved. At any
rate, not a line from his pen has ever
been discovered. Nevertheless, the
young Nazarene is the only man in
all history who wields a universal
sceptre in any sphere.
Jesus is master in the realm of
music. It would require long and
tedious reaaiTsh. to eatalo** the
songs that bear his name. Such
masters as Bash, Mendeßsohn, Haydn
A STENOGRAPHIC COPY
Testimony of Josephus
and Beethoven, each soared higher in
his oratorio exalting the Christ than
in any other production. Anna W.
Patterson, in the “Story of Oratorio,”
says of Handel’s contribution:
“He found in The Messiah a theme
above every theme whereon to base
the oratorio of his own and subse
quent times—for the day seems far
distant when we can point to a tone
cathedral more magnificent and sub
lime than that which , the gifeat Saxon
erected in honor of the Son of God.”
Even the air of secular music that
lives is caught from the young
Nazarene. It is quite evident that
the tune to which “My Country T’is
of Thee” is sung, although its origin
cannot be traced, has for its soul the
vibrations started and perpetuated by
the militant tread of that young man
down through the centuries.
' « Jesus and Music
Prof. Waldo Seldon Pratt, of Hart
ford, is on record as follows: “It is
worth remembering that the art of
music is what it is today largely in
consequence of what religioif has
done for it. The demands that re
ligion has put upon music, the op
portunities and incentives for its de
velopment that religion has afforded,
and the basis of knowledge) and
character that religion has supplied
for musical culture—l mean that
these have furnished to music the
necessary atmosphere and nutriment
for its growth to the stature of a
great and famous art.”
I shall also quote Edmond Dickin
son, Professor of the History of
Music is Oberlin College:
“In the very nature of the case, a
new energy must enter the art of
music when enlisted in the ministry
of Chnst. A new motive, a new
spirit, unknown to Greek or Roman
or even to Hebrew, had taken posses
sion of the religious conscienceness.
To the adoration of the same Su
preme Power, before whom the Jew
bowed in awe-stricken reverence, was
added the of a gift which
the Jew still dimly hoped for; and
this gift brought with it an assur
ance and hence a felicity, which were
never granted to the religionist of
the old dispensation.”
I. shall again refer to Professor Pratt
In his book, “Musical Ministries in
the Church,” he avers that music
found its center between the 12th
and 16th centuries, and that this was
accomplished by religious composers.
Summing it all up, he says:
“The result was the formation of
certain laws of musical grammar
and rhetoric that have never since
been abrogated, though their applica
tions have been extended and multi
plied. ; Every composer today must
follow the lines of proceedure once
for all established by tedious experi
ment and toil some five hundred
years ago.”
Thus it appears, is even declared
by an eminent authority, that Jesus
of Nazareth presides in every studio
of music today, that he has his hand
upon the pen of every composer,
whether religious or secular, and that
he says to them, one and all: “l am
Master here. Use my grammar and
my rhetoric. Follow my instructions.”
Were Jesus removed from the realm
of music, the melody of the world, so
far as human insltrumettitality is
concerned, would be hushed. As
Jesus directs the composer’s pen,
so does he guide the painter’s
brush. The Masters have all hung up
their pictures x>f the Christ. This to
say nothing of the innumerable
paintings that reflect His influence up
on
people and occasions. “The Head
of Christ/* two, one by Hoffman, the
other by Raphael; “The Last Judge
ment,” by Michaelangelo; “The Last
Supper,” by Davinci; “Christ before
Pilot” and “Christ on Calvary,” by
Munkacsy—these are the sort of pic
tures men travel long distances to
observe and before which they bow
their heads in profound reverence.
Remove Jesus from the picture gal
leries of the world, and their attrac
tions will be swept away.
Jesus sad Literature
It is scarcely necessary to discuss
at length the positon Jesus occupies
in modern literature. All who have
read to any extent know that if the
books about Jesus and his religion,
together with the books, secular and
otherwise, that rest upon Him In one
way or another were destroyed, and
that if everything relating to Him and
the religion He founded, and His fol
lowers, were pulled out of secular his
tory, the libraries of the world would
be wrecked.
Again, Christmas emphasizes the
authority of Jesus on earth. Already
the manufacturers and large mer
chants are preparing for the next
Christmas trade. A few weeks prior
to Christmas, the department stores
will take on extra help, likewise the
post-offices and transportation com
panies—this to avoid congestion. A
few days before Christmas your post
man will come to your door late, and,
although the weather may be cold, he
will be perspiring beneath his heavy
burdens. And when Christmas
dawns the wheels of industry will be
still—there will be a universal hush.
The presents will be given, the com
pliments of the season will be ex
changed, families will gather and re
unions will be enjoyed. The wreath
or sprig of holly will be everywhere
—in the home of affluence and the
home of poverty, and out in 'the
woodman’s hut. Even down in the
brothel, the holly will be in a vase,
and early in the morning, before
the day’s debauchery begins, the sor
rowful outcast will look across at
that green sprig and a tear will come
to the eye, because memory will wing
its way back to home and childhood,
and mother’s knee, where a golden
haired girl, beautiful as an angel,
and pure as the white flakes without,
knelt and prayed:
“Now I lay me down to sleep;
I pray the Lord my soul to keep;
If I should die before I wake;
I pray the Lord my soul to take.”
Christmas Worldwide
Some suggest that the multiplicity
of gifts and the manner in which
Christmas today is observed are all
wrong. No matter—l am calling
your attention to facts, and the fact
remains that the gifts are bestowed
and the celebrating is done. *t)oes
someone rise to remark that after all
that has been said, we do not know
the exact date of Jesus’ bfrth.
Again, no matter. lam stating facts,
and the fact remains that once a
year Jesus of Nazareth commands
the civilized world to commemorate
his birth, and the world obeys Him.
Another witness. You have been
familiar with the Christian calendar
all your life. I wonder how often you
have paused to think of its signi
ficance. That calendar is the most
powerful thing on earth. It is more
powerful than the Constitution of the
United States, or the constitution of
any other nation. The constitution of
a nation rules only the lives of its
own subjects. The calendar rules the
world. The calendar is more power
ful than the Holy Bible. The Bible
rules only in the lives of those who
voluntarily accept it as a guide-book.
'Hie calendar rules autocratically in
the lives of all. Can any man get
away from it?
Jesus and Ingersoll
Some years ago, a handsome, mag
netic, brilliant, silver-tongued man
went up and down the country de-
livering lectures against the funda
mentals of the Christian religion.
Had anyone asked him, “Do you ac
cept Jesus of Nazareth as more than
man”? he would have laughed hearti
ly, and answered “No.” Never-the
less, when Col. Robert G. Ingersoll
started from New York to St. Paul to
deliver one of his celebrated lec
tures against the fundamentals
of the religion of Jesus, he stepped
up to a 'ticket office and was.handed
a ticket to St. Paul, dated, stamped,
in the name of Jesus of Nazareth,
and he paid for that ticket with
money issued in the name of Jesus.
Then he boarded the train which
made every mile of its schedule to
St. Paul in the name of Jesus.
Aboard that train, he entertained
himself with magazines published in
the name of Jesus, and sent his tele
grams in the name of Jesus. Arriv
ing hi' St. Paul, he registered at the
hotel in the name of Jesus, and then
went into the dining-room and se
lected his dinner from a menu card
printed in the name of Jesus. He
then proceeded to the hall, paid for
in the name of Jesus, and delivered
his thunderbolt against the funda
mentals of the religion Jesus estab
lished. The next morning at the
breakfast table, he read the glowing
account of his brilliant lecture and, if
he had looked, he would have seen
that the paper he was reading was
printed in the name of Jesus. Even
his fame was heralded in the name of
Jesus. Col. Ingersoll, like all others,
was born in the name of Jesus, his
birth certificate was made out in that
name—there was no other way. He
was married in that ndme, his license
was issued in that name—there was
no other way. He was admitted to
the bar and transacted all his busi
ness in that nams. He could not do
otherwise, the law under wMoh he
lived required it. And when he died,

THE EARLY HISTORY
OF KU KLUX KLAN
The Invisible Empire Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan is the most re
markable movement of modern
times. You will observe that I use
the term “movement.” Many people
are in the habit of thinking of the
Ku Klux Klan as a great, mystical, if
not mythological fraternity. It is
strange and weird. But it is infinite
ly more than that : It is an expres
sion of a great nation’s thought stir
red by a consciousness of the pres
ence of wrong. This movement is re
makable for many reasons.
It is remarkable in its origin. No
movement in the history of the world
was ever born as was this one. It is
an effect, which, in turn, strange as
it may seem, has become a great
world cause. The Ku Klux Klan was
born in the most strenuous period of
American history, the period of
Southern Reconstruction.
Let me paint for you a picture
which will at once make clear the
origin of the movement, and also set
forth the logical methods which grew
out of it.
Meeting of Lee and Grant
I see them now: General Robert
E. Lee, than whom no finer gentle
man, no braver soldier, no truer pa
triot, no greater man was ever born;
and by his side, General Ulysses S.
Grant, another soldier, patriot and
statesman. The occasion was the
surrender of Lee and the Southern
Confereracy to the overpowering
forces of the Union. The final words
had been spoken, the war between the
States had come to an end; swords
had been placed in their scabbards
never to be drawn again, and guns
and other accoutrements of war were
now useless except as relics of the
strangest struggle of the world’s his
tory. General Lee had spoken to his
army; he had looked into faces of
thousands of them as they wept like
children, their hearts breaking over
the Lost Cause. Hungry, ragged,
discouraged, poverty stricken, these
soldiers of the South turned their
faces homeward, to their mothers,
wives and sweethearts who had been
wrestling with poverty and exhaus
tion of all resources. There were
never such hearts as these 1 in the
world’s history. They went back to
their homes now in poverty, horses,
cattle, sheep, pigs and everything
gone, and above all; their wealth lost
in the freedom of the slaves.
(These men who had for four years
fought with a bravery that challeng
ed the admiration of the world now
turned their thoughts to the rebuild
ing of their homes, their farms,
their fortunes and their civilization.
For a little while everything worked
well. And then a dark cloud arose, a
carpet-bagger cloud led by political
mountebanks and. crooked men, scala
wags who not only wished, but dared
to crush the life of these noble south
ern men and women, and to put in
their stead for leadership of the
people the recently emancipated
slave.
There Was No Law
In a few months time all law had
been abrogated. * There was no law.
The legislature of South Carolina
was made up wholly of negroes; ig
norant ex-slaves were made sheriff,
constable, magistrate, and were
given entire control of the political
and legal life of various counties.
Pandemonium reigned everywhere.
Obedient, docile, industrious slaves of
a few months before, through the
agitation of crooks and demagogues,
and by the use of whiskey were
turned into demons. These black
men who a few months before would
have died to protect the womanhood
of the southland, men who during
the four years of the war did protect
the womanhood of the southland,
were, like ravenous beasts of the
jungle, bellowing for blood. Fear
and desperation seized the people; no
home was safe; humiliation, disgrace
and sorrow covered the earth like the
waters cover the sea. The Federal
soldier stood guard over the negro
and protected the carpet-bagger and
the scalawag. Hope was gone.
It was at a time like this that the
Ku Klux Klan was born.
The Other Picture
The other picture is as follows:
In a beautiful little city of North
Carolina the ex-slaves were put into
power. The sheriff of the county
was a boisterous and dangerous ne
gro; he had around him a large
number of free men who, fired by
whiskey, the carpet-baggers and
scalawags, were mad for spoil, for
position, for dominion and rulership.
The sheriff and his henchmen con
ceived the idea of possessing all the
wealth of the county, iq, upon a cer
tain night, he called together his
henchmen, and in the .wee small
hours of the night they assembled in
the cellar of a famous old colonial
home, a home sold by force from
under a family of culture and wealth,
and then occupied by the sheriff.
After lengthy discussion these men
entered into a solemn oath, and
bound themselves to massacre several
of the leading families of the coun
ty, with the understanding that all
of their property be confiscated and
divided among themselves. This
solemn oath was written out and
signed in their own blood.
It happened, however, that there
were klansmen in those days, and
their eyes were open to all the mis
chief making movements. One of
these noble men was in this secret
conclave in these midnight hours.
Before daylight the next morning
the Exalted Cyclops of the county
had all the details of that meeting,
and by daylight couriers were speed
ing upon the highway as fast as the
fleetest footed horses could carry
them. Their message to Klansmen
of adjoining counties was, “Meet at
a certain ford on the river at sun
down tonight!”
Dauntless Men Rode
Dauntless men rode that day; and
by sundown, from the north, the
south, th« east and from the west
came men whose hearts throbbed
with love of home, country and civil
ization. And as darkness came on,
hundreds of robed horses whose feet
were muffled, fell into line and moved
to the city. Riding single file these
brave men surrounded the town and
the sheriff’s home, making a circle
complete. Then they rode two
abreast, making a circle complete,
until they rode four. abreast. Then
a whistle sounded, and the hundreds
of men were as silent as death. They
dismounted. And in the stillness of
the night and the solemnity of the
hour, ten separate numbers were call
ed, —for in the Ku Klux Klan no
name was ever called. These ten
numbers represented ten noblemen,
ten courageous, true and tried sons of
the Old South, sons of the greatest
aristocracy the world ever knew,
knights, patriots, soldiers, all.
The men responded, ~ and the
spokesman of the occasion gave the
following instructions: “Go into the
house, and bring me the sheriff.”
They went in and searched the
house, but the sheriff was nowhere to
be found. They returned and so re
ported.
The instructions then were: “Go
to the front door, enter it, turn to
he first door to the right, put back
the carpet, open the trapdoor, go into
the cellar, and bring me the sher
iff.”....
The Order Was Obeyed
The order was obeyed, and in five
minutes the sheriff stood before the
most mysterious body of men the
world ever saw.
Remember, • will you, that there
was no law at that time, that the
court house did not mean anything.
This man was tried by these men,
found guilty because the document
was produced which he had signed
in his own blood declaring that he
would lead a mob to massacre the
leading white families of the county.
The next morning a sheriff dangled
from a limb of a tree in the court
house yard. From that day until
this, peace and safety have ever
reigned in all that region of North
Carolina.
Who is the man of this age and
generation who will say these men
did wrong ? They would not do
more; they could not do less. To
day the world bows to do them
honor.
Civilization Hung in the Balance
So civilization hung in the balance;
chivalry was receiving its supremest
test; for however dark the days of
war may have been, these days of Re
construction were the darkest days of
all in the history of this earth.
Men's souls were tried. Everything
that was holy, good and worth while
in the South was about to be des
troyed. These men resorted to the
only remedy, and the application of
the remedy was swift and successful.
I declare to you that the spirit of
the Ku Klux Klan in its beginning
is the same spirit that predominates
it today. The spirit and purpose of
the Ku Klux Klan have always been
one; the application and methods
alone are different.
This movement is also remarkable
for its IDEALISM. It gathers up
into itself all the holy traditions
hopes, aspirations, dreams, purposes
and the faith at the Anglo-Saxon end
Protestant fathers. It is not sordid,
and it does not work for paltry pelf;
nor will it sell out for gold. Its
idealism is born in a passion to free
man from all wrongs, prejudices and
unrighteous usurpations of power.
It works where all others have failed
or are failing; it recognizes God’s
law as supreme. If God has made a
man white the Invisible Empire
would not make him black or half
black. It recognizes God’s right to
create the races and to set their
bounds. It bows to God’s plans and
reverently follows where He leads.
It also recognizes the right of all
men to be free. It protects with all
its soul against any and all encroach
ments, be they political, ecclesiastical
or social upon any and all the institu
tions of freedom which have come to
flower and glory in the United States
of America. It dreams of a free
nation in which each and every in
dividual shall enjoy all the rights of
our sacred Constitution. It will die
that men may be free.
A Remarkable Movement
This movement, Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan is also remarkable be
cause of its MYSTICISM. It is hard
for the uninitiated to understand or
appreciate its meaning. Its mysteries
are only understood by those on the
inside. Its helmet, shroud, fiery
cross, and other emblems and symbols
are each profoundly significant, and
is the expression of the highest pa
triotism, the most sublime devotion to
the right as God shall lead men to
know it and see it, to be found any
where m the world. Somewhere it
carries with it an atmosphere of
warning to the unrighteous and to
the bad, and to the designing. It is
at once a challenge and a warning.
It challenges the pure, patriotic, sin
cere son of America; but it is a
solemn warning to the bad, the de
signing, the unscrupulous demagogue.
—From The Ku Klux Klan, by
Dr. Fowler.
IT IS AMERICAN
Rochester, N. Y. Rev. C. E.
Swearingen, in a sermon at the Con
gregational church at Ontario, de
clared he had made a thorough inves
tigation of the Ku Klux Klan and
had failed to find anything un-Amer
ican in its ideals and activities.
“The members have as much right
to organize a secret society as any
other secret organization, and it is
nothing more than persecution to sin
gle them out in an effort to compel
them to publish the roster of their
members and their constitution,” he
declared. Most of the present trou
bles arising from religious indiffer
ences were attributed by the speaker
to “Protestant indifference.” Prot
estants, he added, had failed to do
their political duty and “by neglect
and lack of zeal had permitted Prot
estant Americanism to wane.”
Compulsory education up to the Bth
grade was advocated by the clergy
man.

THOUGHTS
Do you know that your thoughts rule
your life,
Be they pure or impure in the strife?
As you think, so you are,
And you make, or you mar
Your success in the world ■
By your thoughts.
Are you thoughts just and true every
hour?
Then your life will attest with great
power.
If it’s love fills your heart,
Then all hate must depart,
You will find all success
In good thoughts.
Are you kind in your thoughts toward
all?
Then but kindness to you must befall.
As you sow so you reap,
In a measure so deep,
Either pleasure or pain,
By your thoughts.
