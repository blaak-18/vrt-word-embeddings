ehalt endeavor to describe them fully,
faithfully, end ftiarlewily.
Tllf WEEKLY SUN hos now attained
a circulation of over seventy tlinimand
cri|>ien. Its teadefg are found in every
Htut# and Territory, and it« quality in weil
knbwn to tbe public. We Hindi not only
endeavor to keep it fully up to the old
eMnriafd. but to improve and add toits
Variety and power.
THE WEEKLY 8UN will continue to
be » thorough newnpaper. All the new«
of the iluy will lie found in it. Condensed
when unimportant, at lull length when of
moment, and always. we trust, trented in
a clear, interesting and instructive manner
It is our aim to make tbe WEEKLY
8UN the bent family newspaper io the
world. It. will bo full of entertaining and
appropriate rending of every sort, but will
Ïirint nothing to offend tbe mont sei opti
ons and delicate taste. It will always
contain tbe mont jutwresMng stories and
romancea of the day, carefully Detected
and legibly printed.
The Agricultural Department ' s a prom
inent feature in the WEEKLY SUN, and
ita articles will always bo found fresh and
nsefnl to the farmer.
Tbe number of men independent in pol
itics la increasing, and tho WEEKLY SUN
is their paper especially. It belongs to
no party, and obey» no dictation, contend
ing for principle, and for the election of
»he liest men It exposes tbe corruption
that disgraces the country and threaten«
tho overthrow of republican Institutions.
It has no fear of knave«, and seek« no fa
vor« from their supporters.
The market« of every kind and the fash
ions are regularly reported in it» column«.
The price of the WEEKLY SUN Is one
dollar a year for u sheet <>f eight pages, and
fifty-six columns. Ah this barely pay« the
•«pense« of paper and printing, we are
not able to make any discount or allow
any premium to friends who may make
apecial efforts to extend Uh circulation.
Under tho new law. which requires pay
ment of postage in advance, one dollar a»
year, with twenty cents tlio cost, of pre
paid postage added, is the rate of subscrip
tion It is not necessarv to tret up a club
yi order to have the WEEKLY SUN at
thin rate. Any one who sends one dollar
anil twenty cents will get the paper, post
paid, for a year.
