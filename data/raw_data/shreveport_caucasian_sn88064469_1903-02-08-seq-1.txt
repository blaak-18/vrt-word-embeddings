Physical Defects Pointed Out by Bill
Arp-The Difference Between
4 McKinley and Roosevyl:.
.An enthusiastic admnirer of Bill Arm
and the Atlanta Constitution. one of the
bc:t rewstapers in the South. has hand
ed the Caucasian the latest letter by
Pill Arp which he desires to have pub
ilshed for the edification of the many
vwhio do not but shotld, peruse Bill Ar I'
le'ter's in the Atlanta Con titution. To
me." he sadl. "Bill .\rp writeA accorl;ng
to my n tionr. I have n realing
Bill's letter, fr.- years and i delight in
his .ty!e of ripping no things in _ ,
eral. Hei i th ronghlv a Sul-.he rn :-n
a,.Id I w'b Ie cn-: live and write for
evr." \ri:h t his dc-er; ed cimphli:ur-:
-s a prelude we give hill Arp's leut r
and here it is:
"A little more grape. Captain Bragg.'
-said General Taylor at the battle of
Buena Vista. And so we say now to
Captain Teddy. "A few more niggers
to offices up North and a few more to
our Southern posto,;ices. Go the whole
hog while you are at it. McKinley gave
you a starter by appointing a negro over
a white community at Hogansville. and
another at Athens. the cultured college
city of the South. but he got alarmed
and took the back track: It was just such
a case as you have now in Mississippi
at"Indianola. for the people of Hogans
ville went four. miles to get their mail
rather than take it from a negro-a
dirty politician." ' Teddy has done no
worse on the postoffice line. The post
offices are the people's not the presi
dent's. They are almost as near to us and
as sacred as is our preacher or our fam
ily physician. No greater insult. no
greater outrage upon our riglt could be
perpetrated by a tyrant than to appoint
a negro as postmaster in a white com
munity. The difference between Teddy
and Mr. McKinley is that the latter
played fool for a while and quit, but
Teddy keeps it up and grows more de
fiant of Southern opinion and Southern
indignation. Sometimes Providence af
flicts the people with a fool. and some
trtaes with a knave to ty nra unian ewr
thein, iut it looks like we are to ave:
both fool and knave in the same person.
But "the Lord loveth whom He chast
eneth."
A medical friend from over the line
writes me that he has a growing sense
of justice and abounds in sympathy for
our long-suffering people, hut Teddy's
deformity does not conme from original
sin or tbtal depravity, but from physical
defects in his anatomy, and says:
"'I have studied his cranium and find
that he has ton small a cerebellum. His
occiput goes straight up from the me
dulla oblongata and meets the sinciput
at right angles and leaves no room for
moral attributes. A perpendicular back
head lie Teddy's indicates a fighting,
bear-killing, athletic and foolhardy man.
The aphryon and the messial plane are
cramped together and Teddy's back
head is a perpendicular plane without
hill or dale. A man with a very small
cerebellum is peculiar, and it will be
found on inspection of the sinciput or
forehead that the nose and cheek bones
generally rest on an enormous jawbone,
or, as. you might say, the jawbone of an
ass. If Teddy had lived in Samson's
day he would have rejoiced to have
been his armor-jearer, and carried his
jawbone 'sonie . qa
Just so-exactly--not only so, but
als. I understand '" all now;-and thank
t ly medical friend. The lack of' cere
bellum and medulla oblongata and occi
put fhas made Teddy crazy about bears
adt.dneg roes and" other black woolly
things. But I should like to know what
kind of a cerebellum, that fellow Crum
picker or Stmnpsacker or Dirtdauber
hat got that makes him so venomous to
ward our people. At Teddy's request he
lhas introduced a resolution to have a
committee appointed to visit Indianola
and see what our people are doing to
the colored posttistress. Of course, he
will be appointed e.hairma of the com
eittt*i, but Ill wager ten dollars 'he

speech at Charleston and another
New York. in which he says concernin
the right of a state to secede: "If w
accept the judgment of modern student
and investigators it would seem as i
the weight of argument falls into the
Confederate side. The issue was settlec
Iy might and not by right." Then wh:
,'lout they pension our soldiers and pa,

and ask our pardon besides. Four gen

that :ried \\irz and ctnvvicted hinm and
i- him on h perj-nrrd evidenc:. The
1lnger I live the morme I am convincd
thi:t as a gener;l rule the ýmartcst ien
are the meanst-especcially the politi
cians. Think of Henry Ward Beecher
preaching from his pulpit that Sharp's
riles were Fetter than Bibles to convert
the -lave owners of the South. and so
his people bought tie rifles and the am
munition and told old John Brown to
go ahead. But the niggers were loyal to
their masters and wouldn't burn nor kill
nor destroy. And hence Lew Wallace
and Adams and many others armed all
they c.uld muster up and joined the
grand army and marched them down
upon our helpless women an children.
At that time there were 30.000 runaways
up North-fugitive slaves-the meanest
of the race and nobody but an unprin
cipled dog of .a man would have led
them against us. Down further south
the negroes mixed with gentlemen and
were true and faithful during the war,
and as General Henry R. Jackson said,
they ought to have a monument built
to their loyalty as high as the stars.
But, psHiaw! What's the use of
scratching the old sores? Let them scab
over. Are iwe not all brethren since the
Spanish war? Did not we all fight and
blead and lie together in Cuba? Don't
the editor and orators tell us that fra
ternal p prevails between the sec
tions? I ' still sick, and have been out
ofthe h ut twice. in three months,
and, nia t eit is .'Why,., brp9&ad t
rnminate over the wrongs we 'have suf
fered. When the spring comes and the
birds begin to sing and the flowers to
bloom may be I will write more loving
letters: and if Teddy will retract and
apologize for the lies he told on Mr.
Davis I will let him alone, considering
that his cerebellum is limited by the
medulla oblongata and the sinciput.
I never read the modern novel. They
come and they go and are forgotten;
but Miss Pettus of Alabama sent me
the "Princess of Glendale," and I reluc
tantly took a glance at the first page and
got caught. I turned the leaf and read
on and had devoured one hundred pages
before breakfast and all of it during the
day. It is a faithful and charming re
cital of Southern home life on a big
plantation before the war. Then the war
comes. with its distresses, the Forrest
with three hundred men pursues Stract
with fifteen hundred and captures him,
an' Miss Emma Sanson figures as a
heroine- in guiding Forrest across the
river. and then comes the sad story of
Sam Davis, the typical Southern hero.
Interest never flags 'in the beautiful
story, and it will be a landmark for our
children and our children's children, for
it is faithful to the truth of Confederate
history. BILL ARP.
'. s.'J ne tonstitution is mistaken.
Williams, who made that beautiful
speech in New York, was not Northern
Williams, but Southern Williams. He is
from Missouri. and said "we ' of the
South," Not a Northern man except
Charles Francis Adams said a kind
word for us and he left out Mr. Davis.
If he had said what Watterson said or
what Southern Williams said he could
not have gone back to Boston. B. A.
TO PENSION EX-SLAVES
Senator Hanna Offered It But Repu
diates It.
There was submitted, in. the United
States-Senate a few days since by Sen
ator Hanna a bill providing a pension
for slaves. When charged that his mo
tive was to win the negro votes of
Southern delegates to the presidential
nominating convention, Mr. Hanna ex
plained that he introduced the bill sim
ply because be was asked to do so, and
that it was not to win Southern dele
gates from Roosevelt and that he does
not approve of it. Why then should Mr.
Hanna, as an honest man, submit a
measure he would not approve? Why
should he place himself in the attitude
of.a double dealer? But Mr. Hanna has
given the representatives of the South
i o sa oppttnity they should
"Listen a Moment."

the ex-slaves when thousands of men
in the North. hums and dead beats and
camp followers, are drawing pensions
from the government for which the
South must pay its full quota of reve
nue? If the slaves were pensioned. the
money received by them would he ex
pended in the South and would help to
up-build' the South as the pensions of
the Federal soldiers in the North con
tribute in a great measure to the wealth
of the Northern states. It would be good
policy to force the issue on Hanna's bill
as it would practically develop the
hypocrisy of the Republicans' love for
the nigger. Every Southern representa
tive should stand for the bill to pension
the ex-slaves' of the Southern States.
Why not?
SWITCHMAN KILLED
Charles A. Ray the Victim of a De,
plorable Accident.
Thursday night at about 7:35 o'clock
Charles A. Ray. a switchman, was
crushed to death by a switch engine in
the yard of the Vicksburg, Shreveport
and Pacific in this city. In attempting
t jumin foot was canight in ti
guard rail anid before he could extricate
it he was run over by the engine. Ray
had been in the employ of the company
two days. Dr. Coty, coroner, was noti
fied but an inquest was unnecessary.
The body was placed in the care of the
Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen, of
which Ray was a member. The deceased l
was a member of Hickory Comp No. 121
Woodmen of the World, Jackson. Miss.
He was also a Pythian. He was married
and leaves a devoted loving wife to
mourn his untimely end. The funeral
will take place from the family resi
dence, No. 330 Laurel street, at to
o'clock this morning.
THE AMERICAN BRIDE.
There is a difference, it seems, be-!
tween the American bride and the bride
of other countries. The American wom
an adapts herself to changed circum
stances more readily than-any foreigner
can do. As the wife of the farmer or the
capitalist, she acquires rapidly the man
ners of her station. Such is the view
taken by a writer on- the subject of
brides in 'the February Cosmopolitan,
whose article is illustrated with a dozen
fine photographs of lovely woman in
her wedding dress.
STASSFURT INDUSTRY.
The pamphlet "Stassfurt Industry,"
just published, contains an interesting
description of the famous potash mines
in Germany, from which all the potash
imported into this country and used for
manuring is derived. The chapter about
the use of potash in agriculture as one
of the important ingredients of a com
plete fertilizer adds largely to the value
.of the book, and among the many fine
illustrations those showing the experi
ments at Southern Pines. N. C., are of
particular interest to practical farmers.
Copies of this pamphle can be had free
by writing to the German Kali Works,

Pierce's arm was broken and he received
other injuries. The accused were re
