OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
BREAKFAST TOO LATE IN TOWN.
I want to be a farmer, so when I
get up with my work I can go a fish
ing or a hunting. I do not want to
live in town, because the people do
not have breakfast till ten o’clock.
I am a little country boy 10 years
old.—Yours friend, Tinley B. Young,
Quitman, Ga., Route 5, Box 46.
A FLORIDA GIRL.
I hope to be a happy wife, with
fine clothes and diamonds and
wealth. Above all, I hope to be a fine
school-teacher, with a good char
acter. —Beulah Lockey, Grandridge,
Fla.
FROM THE FLORIDA EVER
GLADES.
My brother takes the Jeffersonian,
showed me some little letters that
the Georgia and Texas girls wrote. I
have two brothers that I am proud
of. I don’t like some of the girls’
letters, as boys have a harder time
than girls. lam sorry for a girl who
has no brothers to go around with
her. If the people of the world could
only see what Mr. Watson was trying
to do to enlighten them, they would
all agree, and all the girls would
have intelligent brothers. I am a
little girl, 10 years old, and live in
the Ten Thousand Islands.—Aubrey
B. Wiggins, Everglades, Fla.
A NEW CLUB-MATE.
Mr. A. N. Holland, of Girard, Ga.,
is my grandpa. He has got seventy
five acres of corn. I think it will
average 15 or 20 bushels to the acre.
Papa takes the Jeffersonian, and he
likes it well. I like to read it my
self. I like to read the letters in it.
—Minnie Lee Ward, 11 years old,
Girard, Ga.
FROG-HOUSES AND SOLDIERS.
My troubles are that I can’t spell
good, but I know my A, B, C’s. One
trouble is that when I make one frog
house, and sit down to make another,
I sit on the one I made before. I have
some paper soldiers, and stand them
up, and when mother comes with her
long skirts, she sweeps them down.
They are my troubles. —Sam Starke
Grogan, 7 years old, R. F. D 11, El
berton, Ga.
NO TROUBLES AT ALL.
I agree with you that “Our Post-
Card Club” is a fine cure for the
blues, and am sure some girls and
boys would like to have a confidant,
as there are many children in this
world that have many troubles, al
though I have none, so I will not
complain. I live with my parents in
the city of Pine Bluff; go to church
and Sunday school. I will be 16
years old the 11th of September. I
would love to have a shower of post
cards on my birthday, and will an
swer all cards received. I made this
same offer once'.before in this col
umn; also received many pretty pos
tals, and did not fail to answer them.
I would like to hear from Miss Julia
Talberg, Dulce, Minn., and Mr.
Ernest C. Wood, Forney, Ala. I will
close, hoping to receive many pretty
Glje 3affcrsonlan
postals, which will all be answered
on the day received. —Lola Lyon, R.
F. D. 3, Pine Bluff, Ark.
P. S. —I tried to name a barber
shop here “The Jeffersonian,” but
failed, as it was named “The Mid
way;” but I will try again, and may
be I will succeed this time.
FROM SOUTH GEORGIA.
My father takes the Jeffersonian,
and I like to read it very much, as
there is so much good reading in it.
I think everybody should read the
good old Jeffersonian. My father
thinks there is no paper like it. He
says he would not give the Jerffer
sonian for all the other papers. I
long to see the day come w’hen the
people will cast their votes for the
Hon. Thomas E. Watson, and he will
be elected President of the United
States, and be honored as George
Washington was when he was elected
President. My home is situated on
the public road, not a great way from
Thomasville, our county seat, where
I have heard Mr. Watson speak twice,
and hope to hear him again in the
near future.—A. L. Jones, Ochlock
nee, Ga.
DON’T TALK ABOUT IT.
I will not come to you with my
troubles. I think little children
should not talk about their troubles,
because we have so many more pleas
ures and good times. When we feel
very disagreeable, we ought to think
of how much better off we are than
children used to be. lam sorry Min
nie Winn made her mistake, but I
am glad you corrected her. It learn
ed me a lesson that I won’t forget,
and I will never say I like anything
“fine” again. lam ten years old and
in the fourth grade.—Kathleen Gro
gan, R. F. D. 11, Elberton, Ga.
Just a word, Miss Kathleen. When
you learn something, some one else
does the teaching. You learned the
lesson, so “it taught me” would be
correct, wouldn’t it?
Dont forget that we are offering
two or three little prizes for the
largest list of boys’ and girls’ names,
made with the following letters: A,
Y, C, T, D, S, E, R, F, O, N, H, I,
M, L, J. Nicknames barred. Age
limit, 15 years. All lists to be in our
hands by August 19th. Some one in
the family of the contestant must be
a subscriber.
We don’t want you to stop writing
letters. Send us a letter once in a
while, about your troubles, or your
jokes, or anything that will interest
our club-mates. Our family must be
quite a happy one, for Daddy Jim has
had very few troubles reported to
him. One young gentleman this
week has had a little difficulty with
his frog houses; and that is a trou
ble which he will outgrow. As to the
paper soldiers, Daddy Jim’s experi
ence is that they are a very unsteady
lot, and that tin soldiers are much
more satisfactory, except that the
paint on them is not palatable and is
apt to disagree with you.
When writing to advertisers, al
ways mention Tha Jeffersonian.
