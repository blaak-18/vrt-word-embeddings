Congressman Hudson's Bill.
)During the last session Congress
Twn:l Iludon introduced a pension
bill out of whvich the I)enioeracy
are Irying to m:kte political capital.
This bill was one of a niumber ini
triNluctld lby Populists to iicrease
the volimi of (nrlrenclly amnoii~ the
leoplle :rd to that xtent relieve
them of their present distress. The
bill pr'ovided that any penisioner
coull, under certain conditions,
surreinder his penlsio and receive
a.1 a ciolln ili itil, l the allounllt of
his pension tp ten years, and the
monely so paid was to be a new is
sue of l~gal tender. lNot a single
dollar was to be taxed fromt the
peoplle for t'.e paymenct. Let us
see how it works nonw and how it
wiiidl work undelr this bill. Now
the pensioner receives, say, 150d1
per year out of" monely raFisd b)y
t.axation li li the ,people. lie re
ceives this aniolinlt ainnally, no
matter iit he lives ten or forty years.
I'nder the ,ioperatiion of this bill he
wounld trecive I$1,50 in a lump stun
uandl no nlore, andti this amount
wonuld coene out of a new issue of
lOllney tha;t cost the governmeint
nothing. The people would in this
case he relieved flori taxation al(nd
the volume of money ini circulation
increasetd and times made better.
This is a coiciSP explanation of
the bill.-Ni;tional WVatchinan.
Goes Over to the Populists.
