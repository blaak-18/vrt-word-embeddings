Most Diseases Cause by Constipa
tion. Sewerage of the Brain
“It goes to the brain naturally, and
to every part of the body, every organ
being fed on this polluted blood, or
sewerage. It goes to your face in the
form of pimple-poison and nreaks out
on the skin. It goes to your head and
gives you headache and dizziness, it
goes to your brain and makes you
drowsy, it weakens the stomach and
causes dyspepsia, and bad breath, it
goes to the liver and causes bilious
ness, it goes to the kidneys and even
tually gives rise to Bright’s Disease,
it goes to the heart and makes it
thump, it goes to the eyes and they
lose their lustre, it makes your nerves
flabby and weak and out-of-sorts, and
this is the advance agent of all kinds
of disease, which you couldn’t get at all
if there was pure, rich, red blood flow
ing in your veins and your whole body
was in prime condition.”

Old Jube, Little Phil, John B.
Gordan and the Valley Campaign
Jefferson, Tex., July 24, 1909.
My Dear Sir: —Enclosed is an aw
ful clipping, not from J. D., but from
Tom E. Watson’s editorials—weekly
Jeffersonian, 15th inst.
You — a writer of history for our
children to learn —to hit Gen. Jubal
A. Early such a lick as that—stabbed,
caesar-like, in the house of the
Southern people.
Read Percy Gregg’s (Englishman’s)
history of Early’s campaign to Wash
ington and into Pennsylvania. The
overthrown of Sigel and Hunter and
Lew Wallace (good man) at Mono
cacy. Then of Grant sending Sheri
dan with 70,000 men, and even then
with less than 20,000 the bloody bat
tles of Winchester, Fisher Hill and
Cedar Run fully witness and attest
that Sheridan did fear Early and his
valiant little army, and that Early
gave twice as many dead men from
Sheridan's ranks to feed the soil of
Shenandoah Valley as he lost.
Was not Sheridan afraid when he
was riding that black charger to death
trying to rally his routed men at Ce
dar Run?
Abuse Bryan all you will (and I
concede you personally have the best
of reasons to strike him politically),
but don’t—do not, abuse “Old Jube’’
or eulogize one Sheridan, whose
equestrian statue disgraces Capitol
Hill.
GEO. T. TODD.
P. S. —I didn’t intend taking the
weekly when I ordered the monthly
and Uncle Remus; but, as it comes,
here is one dollar for it, and I want
the Watson pocket knife.
Youb friend,
GEO. T. TODD.
Dear me! How touchous we are.
How does anybody get the idea that I
stabbed Gen. Jubal Early, as the as
sassins stabbed Julius Caesar? All I
said was that the Missouri edi
tor was off his base in stating that
Bryan was the one Democrat that
the Republicans were afraid of. As
a historical parallel, I said that the
Republicans were no more afraid of
Bryan than Sheridan was of Early.
Where’s the assassination? Brother
Todd will hardly contend that Phil
Sheridan was afraid of “Old Jube.”
I didn’t say that Early was afraid
of Sheridan. That grim old fighter
didn’t know what fear was, —any
more than Sheridan did. Both were
types of the perfectly brave man.
But Old Jube did get licked a good
deal, didn’t he? And Sheridan was
the man that walked his log, wasn’t
he?
Look here! We musn’t fall out
with one another about such things as
these. And don’t ask me to hunt up
English histories and Northern books
to inform myself about Jubal Early.
I can find all I need in Southern sto
ries of the war. What I know about
Old Jube I learned from soldiers who
fought under him, and from Southern
magazines, newspapers and books —
particularly such works as those of
De Leon, John Esten Cooke, and John
B. Gordon.
Gen. Gordon was with Old Jube in
that Valley campaign as commanderown soldiers, what’s the use of con-
3effersotilaifc
of a division. In his “Reminiscen
ces” Gen. Gordon tells us all about it.
As he was with his chief all the time,
and saw the management of the cam
paign from the Southern side, he is
better authority than Percy Gregg, or
any other outsider.
I think Mr. Todd does Gen. Sheri
dan injustice when he intimates that
it was fear of Early that caused the
famous ride from Winchester. I
thought scared men galloped away
from the battle-field, rather than into
it.
There is a story which explains how
Little Phil happened to be caught
napping that time, but it isn’t fit to
print. There is also a story of how
Old Jube let the victory slip out of
his hands. If Mr. Todd will ask one
of Early’s old soldiers, he will learn
what it is.
Monocacy was a brilliant victory,
but Gordon and his division won it.
Let Mr. Todd write to that superb
soldier, Gen. Clement A. Evans, At
lanta, Ga., and ask if that isn’t a fact.
(My deal* old friend Jack Roberts
was there, and saw Gen. Evans when
that officex- was shot out of his sad
dle. )
Cedar Creek ought also to have
been a crowning triumph, but Gen.
Early could not be persuaded to let
General Gordon finish the job, as he
pleaded fox* orders to do.
General Thomas L. Rosser com
manded Early’s cavalry in that cam
paign, and he, like Gordon, is good
authority on Early’s generalship.
There is a well-known letter of Ros
ser's to Early in which the lieutenant
says to his chief,
“You are an honest man and a pa
triot, but God never cut you out for
a general.”
No; Sheridan was not afraid of
Early, but there was a soldier that he
stood in wholesome dread of — the
Confederate private. Sheridan knew
from bloody experience that, no mat
ter how poorly handled, the Confeder
ate private was an ugly customer to
tackle. And Sheridan, with his over
whelming numbers manifested a cau
tion in attacking Early’s little army,
which is the highest possible tribute
to the heroes in gray.
By the way, Mr. Todd, the Con
federate soldiers were famous for the
accuracy with which they sized up
their generals. It didn’t take Johnny
Reb long to find out the difference be
tween a Magruder and a Lee, a Hood
and a Johnston. Now, how did Early’s
soldiers size up their commander?
That is the supreme test.
Turn to page 331 of Gordon’s
“Reminiscences,” where he describes
the arrival of Kershaw’s division of
South Carolina troops, a reinforce
ment to Early from Lee’s army.
“Cheer after cheer came from their
husky throats,” etc. It was Early’s
men greeting the new-comers.
“ ‘Hurrah for the Palmetto boys!
Glad to see you, South Ca’liny! Did
you bring' any more guns for Phil
Sheridan?’ ”
That gives the whole thing away.

Catarrh is not only dangerous, but it
causes bad breath, ulceration, death
and decay of bones, loss of thinking
and reasoning power, kills ambition
and energy, often causes loss of appe
tite, indigestion, dyspepsia, raw throat
and reaches to general debility, idiocy
and insanity. It needs attention at
once. Cure it with Gauss’ Catarrh
Cure. It is a quick, radical, permanent
cure, because it rids the system of the
poison germs that cause catarrh.
In order to prove to all who are suf
fering from this dangerous and loath
some disease that Gauss’ Catarrh Cure
will actually cure any case of catarrh
quickly, no matter how long standing
or how bad, I will send a trial pack

It is aggressive, independent, different, fas
cinating, instructive, fearless and attracting
the attention of reformers everywhere.
Its theological department is a wonder. It
pleases the progressive and offends the creed
bound. It is Watsonian in many things and
“more so.” Richard Potts, a man until lately
unknown, is the curious editor. He is a radi
cal of the radicals and strikes straight from
the shoulder.
