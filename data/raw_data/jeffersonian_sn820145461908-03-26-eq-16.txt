WATCH THE DATE ON THE LABEL!
“Under the new postal regulations, weekly and monthly publications are
allowed a limited time to collect subscriptions, and they are not permitted to
carry the names of delinquent subscribers beyond a certain date.
“Our subscribers will help us greatly if they will keep an eye on the date
when their subscriptions expire, as shown by the labels; and by renewing at
or before expiration they will save us the trouble of calling their attention to
the fact.
“A postal card sent to a subscriber to notify him that his time is out is
not a dun; it is a gentle reminder that if he does not renew in a short time,
his name will be dropped from the mailing lists, in accordance with the law.
“Watch the date on the label!”

, NEW THREAT OF SPECIAL SESSION.
(Continued from Page One.) t
The amendments suggested to the Sher
man anti trust bill were discussed briefly.
The president said that a bill would be pre
sented providing for the legalizing of traf
fic agreements between railroads. He called
attention to the fact that labor organiza
tions had been expected to agree to such legis
lation in return for a provision exempting
them from the operations of the law.
Where Rupture Took Place.
The legislators present were not ready to
assent to the demands made by labor in then
bill of grievances recently submitted to con
gress, and on that account urged that it would
be inadvisable to -attempt any revision of the'
Sherman law at this time.
It is said that the president, while not actu
ally rejecting it, was not disposed to agree
with the advice given him.
He declared ihat it was but justice to the
railroads to permit traffic agreements under
proper restrictions and control by the inter
state commerce commission, and said that no
interests would be injured by such legislation.
He was not impressed by the statement
made to him that labor would regard this
as extending benefits to railroads and with
holding them from unions.
UUltimatum is Issued.
The president was told flatly that such a
course at this time would be bad politics for
the majority party to play. On the statement
that it was not certain that labor had rejected
unalterably the proposal for an agreement
under which some of the benefits would accure
to organized labor, the subject went over
until such time as the president shall be ready
to present his bill in concrete form.
Messrs. Aldrich, Dalzell and Payne said
that they might be of different opinion upon
seeing the bill.
Representative Hepburn talked over with
the president the terms of the bill amending
the anti-trust law as it has been modified since
labor’s attitude became hostile to the general
scheme urged by the civic federation. Mr.
Hepburn will introduce the bill in the house
probably Monday.—Atlanta Journal.
Every promise is built upon four pillars:
God’s justice, which will not suffer him to de
ceive; his grace, which will not suffer him to
forget; his truth, which will not suffer him to
change; and his power, which makes him able
to accomplish.—Salter.
It is no such heinous matter to fall afflicted
as, being down, to lie dejected. It is no dan
ger for a soldier to receive a wound in bat
tle, but, after the wound is received, through
despair of recovery to refuse a remedy; for
we often see wounded champions wear thb
palm at last and after fight, crowned with
victory.—St. Chrysostom.
Kindle, O\Lord, our hearts with light and
life by the holy fire of thy love and blessing.
—Thomas a Kempis.
God hath promised pardon to him that re
penteth, but he hath not promised repentance
to him that sinneth. —St. Anselm.
