Thin hair is thickened, falling hair
checked, and baldness often, though
not always cured by its uee. Noth
Sling can restore the hair where the
follicles are destroyed, or the glands
atrophie ad and ecayed. But such as ,
* remain can be saved for usefulness
he by this application. Instead of foul-.
* ing the hair with a pasty sediment, it
will keep it a lean and vigorous. Its ).
. caresional ase will prevent the hairit
. from turning grao or fallingolZ and
consequently prn nt baldness. Free
from those deleterious substances
which make some preparations dan. f
erous, and inlurious to the hair, the
Vior can only benefit but not harm
it. If wanted merely for a
HAIR DRESSING,
nothing else can be found so desir
able. Containing neither oil nor
dye, it does not soil white canmbric,
and yet lasts long on the hair, giving
