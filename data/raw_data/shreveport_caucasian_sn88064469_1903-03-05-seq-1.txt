THE BOYS, IN GiRAY
MUSICAL TRIUMPH OF MRS.
IIOLLINGSWORTH-WVATKINS.
"Three Centuries of American Ballads"
in Costume-Enterainment of Con
federate Veterans in New York.
The Caucasian is gratified to note that
Mrs. Hollingsworth-Watkins (Adah
Hollingsworth), who has resided in
New York city since she left her home
in Shreveport soon after her marriage,
is achieving flattering success and tri
umphs in her art. At the thirteenth an
nual b.nquet of the Confederate Vet
erans Camp of New York, given at the
\Waldorf-Astoria, Mrs. Hollingsworth
Watkins arranged a program of songs,
divided into three parts, giving an illus
tration of three epochs of American
taste. The first part consisted of the
songs of Colonial Days-of ballads
which were brought from England by
the wives and daughters of the gentle
men who settled the Virginia and
Maryland plantations in the Seven
teenth and enighteenth ceutrie(. i hey
were sung to the lute, and later to the
harpsichord, and were a factor in the
creation of the farmers' social life of
that period of American history.
The second part was made up of
"Songs of Ante-Bellum Days." The pe
riod between 1830 and 186o has come
to be considered the romantic period of
American social life. Music was the
chief part of every woman's education,
for it was the time when it was -de
manded that she should be an enter
tainer. These are the ballads which
wecre sung to the guitar and the piano
from New Orleans to Boston.
The third .part of the program was
made up of selections from the songs by
favorite American composers of today.
Referring to this entertainment, the
American Art Journal, a leading au
thority on musical art, says:
"The musical attraction at the dinner
of the Confederate Veteran Camp in
New York, at the Waldorf-Astoria on
January 26, proved to be the hondsome
and accomplished Louisiana singer and
artiste, Mrs. Hollingsworth-Watkins,
with her sympathetic rendering of ante
bellum. songs that were familiar and
dear to the hearts of tlie Boys in Gray.
Her series was given in costume, each
and ,every one Was appltuded to the
echo` and the audience sealed her tri
umph when she responded to a vocif
erous recall with the 'Suwanee River.'
"Commander Edward Owen, of the
New York Camp, acted as toastmaster.
On his right sat Mayor Low, next to
C.hbrles Frineis Adams. Others at the
g~iests' table were Col. Watterson, Wil
liam Hepburn Russell, Er-Chief Justice
of Tehnessee D. L' Spodgrass, General
Thomas-H. Hubbard, Wa!ter S. Logan,
ex-Justice Roger A. Pryor, ex-Justice
Augustus Van Wyck and .General A.
S. Barnes. Among others seated at the
tables there were: Dr. Simon Baruch,
General Francis V. Greene, Justice
Charles, M. Truax, ex-Judge Win. M.
K. Olcott, Dr. Frank M. Deems, Colonel
Prentiss Ingraham. Colonel and Mrs.
Atidtew G. Dickinson, Colonel Arthur

Notwithstanding the Old Cornfeds

in the city of. New York. almost an
Empire in itself. a here there is congre
gated all kinds of people from every
part of the world, and where as leaders
in commercial pursuits and industries
are the old boys who wore the Gray.
and where the sons and daughters of
these "old boys" are achieving distinc
tion and fortune, and of the ,Louisiana
representatives Shreveport can well
claim a full share of the credit which
is being reflected by the young women
born and reared in our midst, who in
art, in science and in literature are be
ing rewarded with gratifying successes
and triumphs.
RIVER AND WEATHER.
The rivei is rising steadily and at
last account w\as falling slightly at Ar
thur City and rising slowly at Fulton,
the guage at Fulton being 30 feet. At
Shreveport the rise is steady and will
continue until the water from above
shall have passed away.
The weather, well the weather has
been about as mean, unpleasant and dis
agreeable as the dead-beat, who when
hequested to pay, his the paper "discon
tinued" or "don't want it" or "refused"
sent through the postoffice. But such
fellkows wil.t get their full dues some
day, when they reckon with Old Nnck.
The Mississippi river is high and this
will operate in holding the water in
Red river. It is needless to say that all
low lands not protected by levees will be
flooded, but this is the result of high
nwater and to repeat what should be
familiar to all dwellers of the Red river
valley would be the rehearsal of an old
story. When the sun shines for all and
Gentle Annie is warbled and whiktled
around and about the country, we will
all -feel more joyful and buoyant with
cotton at ioc provided the next crop is
not all cotton to the detriment of corn
and hog.
When the time comes for seeding cot- 1
ton, let the wise farmer plant a few pigs
for fall and winter hogs.
MISS CARRIE SAUNDERS.
After a brief illness Miss Carrie Saun
ders died at her home on Market street
Friday afternoon at 4 o'clock., In this
great bistling world, in the eagerness
andriush a r- gain a atratign4, Miss
Saiaders, fas content in the beautiful
valley, .w-ith sweet violets from which
she could behold the pinnacles and the
glamour in the fullest realization of the
consciousness that whatever she did add
had to do was done as best she could
indeed, well done. If frail of body, her
mind was rich in all the traits and love
lness which ennoble womankind, and
along her path she always spoke kindly
words, and - her cheerfulness won her
friends everywhere. At an early age she
was an orphan, a meaning which is 'fully
comprehensible to those only who have
experienced such a misfortune. At the
time of her demise she was connected
with the Elite, edied and published by
Mrs. Julia Rule,, who, with tearful eyes,
could speak only-words of praise'oflher
untiring, faithful associate. And so has
a life ended, a life which was useful, a
life which has been rewarded with a
glorious immortality.
And those who attended the burial of
Miss Saunders rin the old cemetery Sat
urday evening, and those who, knew tier
when a little child, and then a girl Ind
then a maiden and then a y.nmg woman
who had met and faced the duties of
practical every day life, will not soon
forget Carrie Saunders, but in their
hearts there will linger sunbeams radiat
ing' from her invigorating cheerfulness.
WORLD'S FAIR NOTES.
The fence around the World's Fair
grounds will be six miles long. Steps
have been taken to have this built at

The special grand stand for the Cen
tennial, ceremonies on April 30, May 2
and 3 next, will seat 3jooo people. It
will be 800oo feet long.
Thomas K. Brunner, for eighteen
years secretary of the State Board of
Agriculture of North Carolina, has been`
appointed superintendent of special ex
hibits in the World's Fair department of
agriculture by Chief F. W. Taylor. Com
plete special exhibits will be made of
several mportant farm crops and their
products~, These are sugar beets, corn,
cotton, rike and tobacco.
The demand for World's Fair exhibit
space in all departments is such that it
will undoubtedly be all taken months
before the opening dayi Allotments are
being made rapidly. The value of the an

U. S. SENATORS
THEIR ELECTION BY A DIRECT
VOTE OF THE PEOPLE.
The State Legislatures Have the Power
to Command the Senate-Some
Objections Discussed.
New York American, Feb. 21: The
"American" is urging upon the various
State Legislatures now in session the
expediency of passing a joint resolution
making application to Congress for the
calling of a Constitutional Convention
for the purpose of submitting to the
people an amendment providing for the
election of United States Senators by
direct vote.
When thirty legislatures have adopt
ed such a resolution the convention
must be called. Thus the obstructive
tactics of the Senate, which year after
year has stubbornlyy refused to concur
with the House in submitting the
amendment, will be defeated.
There is no argument against this re
form that will bear examination.
The favorite objection is that, should
the people and not the legislatures elect
senators, the.Senate would in some mys
terious way cease to represent the sov
ereignty of the states.
It is evidently expected that this con
tention will be peculiarly Afdective with
Democrats, because of the party's his
torical position as th'.upholder of state
rights.
The objection is groundless. The
manner in which senators. are- or may
be elected has nothing whatever to do
with the Senate's character, with its
place in our scheme of gawernment. No
matter how senators are chosen, the
constitutional right of' each State to
equality of representation in the cham
ber can not be impaired.
There is, therefore, no reason why
any Democrat, as a 'Democrat, should
be hostile to the change from election
by legislatures to election by the people:
On the contrary, the proposal is thor
oughly democratic, since it gives more
power to the people.
Neither would the change reduce the
dignity of the Senate. The notion that
law-makers who owe their seats to a
method of choice which implies that the
people are unfit for the duty of select
ing them are somehow more "dignified"
than public servants elected at the polls
by popular vote is utterly un-American,
because it is essentially aristocratic.
Carry the notion to its logical length,
and we should possess a hereditary Sen
ate, supremely august for the reason
that the people had no hand in creat
ing it
State rights Democrats and those Re
are at equal liberty to support the popu
lar election reform, since it has not a
shadow of bearing upon state rights or
centralization.
Neither is it in any sense a party
question.
It is advocated by men of all parties,
and favored by an overwhelming ma
jority of the American people.
Why?
Because experience has demonstrated
that the plan of electing senators by the
legislatures is a failure, and worse than
a failure.
It has led to flagrant corruption.
It has deprived states for long periods
of representation in the Senate.
It has lowered the quality of legisla
tures by frequently making the election
of their members dependent not upon
fitness, but upon their willingnessg to
vote for some particula; candidate for
the Senate.
It has produced bad state government
by causing contests which have taken
the minds of legislators away from the
affairs of their states.
It has made the senatorial office less
the reward of merit than the prize of
ambitious and ,unscrupulous wealth.
It has enabled powerful corporations,
seeking to secure or retain unjust privi
leges, to send men to the Senate as rep
resentatives of their private interests
and not of the interest of the states.
Election of senators by direct vote
would make the Senate what it ought to
i-resesting the people of
portunities of predatory wealth to clothe
its servants with senatorial power and
dignity.
It would give us a tree Senak, to
which poor but able men could aspire,
in place of a house of lords 4tr the
trusts.
The "American" hopes 0b see many
legislatures within the next few weeks
join in this thoroughly American move
meut. Twenty-nine states have already
declared for in general terms. There
is no reason why every one of them
should not put its approval in the form
of a demand for a Constitutional Con
vention.
The Senate has refused to grant tlhe
petitions, coming from legislatures and
other sources, for the submission of the
desired amendment.
But the people can prevail in spite of
the obstructing Senate. The Constitu
tion provides a way.
i wo-thirds of the State Legislatures
have but to make the demand for a Con
stitutional Convention, an dthe Senate
will have no choice but to yield obedi
ence.
Every patriotic man, ,regardless of
party, who holds a seat in any State
Legislature and believes that the people
are the safest repository of power, will
vote for a joint resolution instructing
Congress to give the citizens of the
states of the Union the righi to say at
the polls how they want their senators
'elected.
The time has come to rebuke the Sen
ate for its unrepublican conduct, and
push its insolently obstructive will aside.
WVEATHER BULLETIN
The Cold, the Warm and the Storm
Waves, Forecasted.
(Copyrighted 1903 by W. T. Foster.)
St. Joseph, Mo., Feb. 28.-My last
bullefin gave forecasts of disturbance
to cross the continent March I to 6,
warm wave February e8 to March 4.
cool wave March 3 to 7.
The next disturbance will reach the
Pacific coast about March 5, cross west
of Rockies by close of 6, great central
valleys 7 to 9, eastern states so.
I expect temperature of this disturb
ance to be moderate with no great ex
tremes and while heavy rains may fall
in a few localities the general rainfall
will be small in amount.
The general tendency of the tempera
ture during the first ten days of March
will be upward to a greater extent than
the season requires and while this con
tinnes precipitation must be light.
Warn' wave will cross west of the
Rockies about March 5, great central
valleys 7, eastern states 8. Cool wave
will cross west of Rockies about March
8, great central valleys so, the eastern
states 12.
This cool wave will not be severe and
it will continue to the north not reach
ing the southern states.
March will be a cold month. Three
general cold waves reaching meridian
go not far from I, 2o and 30, will bring
the average tempearture of the montli
toward the winter end of the thermom
eter, although the warm waves that will
reach the great central valleys moving
eastward about 12, 18 and 23 will give
us some premonitions of the coming
spring tide.
Generally the precipitation of March
will be about or above normal, but
some sections will get a serious drouth
commencing in March and extending
through April.
I expect very cold weather about and
immediately following date of this bul
letin, but this cold spell will not re
main long.
Temperature of the week ending
March 9 will average below "normal and
rainfall will not be great.
First days of March will be generally
cold with a rising temperature and a
cessation of precipitation. Not much
rain till after 12.
