NOTICE TO ADI)ERTIERS.
All defendants in judicial sales
have the right to select the paper
in which the advertisement is to be
inserted, therefore we would ask
our friends to give us a bid before
advertising. The Populist is be
ing run in the interest of humani
tv. and it is the duty of all men to
support it. A so those who enter
'homesteads have a rihbt to select
their own paper for advertising.
Don't fail to give us a call and we

Woaconformist.
We are in receipt of some curi
eus letters from Washington. The
writers have a grievience and their
minds are evidently burdened with
some great state secret, though we
Snd it difficult to ascertain from
their letters exactly what hurts
thjem. The burden of their com
plaint is that the socialists captur
ed the St. Louis conference and
made it do something which, in the
minds of these perturbed Wash
ingtonians, should not have been
done. Morever, these gentlemen
inform us, the same malign influ
ence dominates the whole Populist
paary and prevents it from doing
:eomething which the Washington
.ontingent is anxions to have done.
Several of the leading Populist pa
pers are criticised in this comnec
, tion. Their dipleaslure is especi
tilydirected at the Welthmakers,
the Tope Advocate, the Farm
er Tribnme and the Noncosform
-t. These papers have been act
lIg badly, it seemas. Just what
they hbave done to ofend is not
apecllcally pointed out, but so far
e weean gather they committed
t oaese byurging the St. Louis
odamsce to stand bhy the Omaha
platlorm and not attmptto cbhge
orbthrow cokld water on it by
damming it with int praise. Just
- whm it besme wrong fora popl

They have a vei" ttdii,'t il;,res'-
ion that they prevented certain in
fluences from calituriilir them. but
all m ho attended will do~ibtless
learn with surprise that they were
taken into a hostile camlp "'unbe
!:nowns-" to tellselves. iJust who
it was that g bhlel ti, is rather
ldarkly hiunted at than clearly p)oint
ed out. Some say it was the bank
ers. Others allege it was the "ex
tremists of the party." Still eoth
ers, and here is where our Was=h
ington contingent shows its pc"w
er. of preternatural deviation, af
firm n ith all the positivefness of
their accumulated wisdom that the
socialists are the individuals who
did the business. In coilse(qUCenci
of all this, we are warned that a
new party is to be formed- Biy
whom, when or where is not spec
ified. No names are given, but we
are left to iafer that it is b1y those
who insist that the campaign of "!t;
must he made on the silver issue
alone. The new party is held out
both as a threat and a warning,
also to punish those of us who in
sisted that the Omaha platform
should remain the party chart un
til changed by another national
convention.
As far as the Nonconformist is
concerned it has no objection to
anlybody forming a new party who
wants to do so. In fact we would
he glad to see this take place, es
pecially if the silver democrats and
republicans are to compose it. We
would like to see these gentlemen
flocking together under one ban
ner as it would weaken the com
mon enemy that much if it did no
more. " As for the Nonconformist
it can't be counted in on such a
move. Especially can it not be
tempted off on a wild-goose chase
by little secret meetings in dark
corners at Washington, resembling
both in numbersa and ssur'ance the
"Three Tailors of Tooley Street."
Morever the Nonconformist loces
not approve of a "single plank."
There is much 'wore in this move
ment than free silver and though
we are sincerely for that and have
fought its battle long and earnest
ly, we are for much more than is
embodied in free coinage. It is
only one phase even of the finan
cial question, is equalled in impor
tance by other planks in our plat
form and completely overshadow
ed by the main issue. The Non
conformist, in short, stands where
it always stood. It can't be coax
ed or frightened into any attack,
open or indirect, upon the Omaha
platform, nor will it join in any
movement, whose effect, whatever
the design, is to disrupt and de
moralise the party of the people.

tion, having moral and political tc
fiets oi thie lfiture, l'ortldiug as it
is decided. No man iof mly knowl
edge has ever attemptedl to dlteiml
liquor selling flroln a mnoral stand
point, thereithre it mlay ie, accepted
as a factet that the withholing of
license will add to the morality of
our people.
Next, no mant of my knowi ledge
has ever attenmpttd to prove that
our people can better themselves
financially by the use of liquor, as
lhe only parties who are ti an'ial
ly bettered are the retail dealer
here in our eommuninuity, andl the
wholesale dealer who resides in
some Western State, and is usual
ly a member of the cursed whiskey
trust, which cuts such a figure inll
our natio'al politics. The saloonl
keeper, if he is a good Ilsiness.
manl, rouldh elg';lge ill solmii other
business in which he could mIake a
good lving, and not drtag down
his customers (to a level, iin many
cases with e hrltes), but upbutild
then by selling them articles that
would make their families haplpier
and more contented. If he is not
a good business man, he had better
retire to some farm and make an
hoLest living, where the sight of
barefooted children in with ter would
not suggest the question, "I)id I
not sell liquor to the fauther for the
money that should have shod those
poor unfortunates i"
I see that one of your corres
pondents figures on the amount of
license paid by the parish, and
seems to think that is one reason
why men shouil vote for a continu
ation of the business. It seems to
me to be a very poor investment
for the poor whiskey drinker to vote
for its continuation, for it only
shows what a heavy burden he is
calrrying, besides the headaches
and the shame lie nmust feel when
he thinks of the conmforts he could
have given his family with the
money he has squanoered on his
own selfish stomach. You know
that the salool-keeper does not go
out the money and tur, it over to
the parish for the pleasure of as
sisting in bearing its expenses, but
it must first come out of the lw;k
eta of the poor drink'ers, who make
his business profitable. The men
who (do the drinking do the paying
of the Heense, pay the freightl pay
the internal revenue, pay the si
lon-keeper, andt then have all the
miseries of conscience anid the
physical suffering to bear alone
and unassisted. The 0only argu
ment now used is the personal lib
erty and the inability of the poor
to get a drink when they want it.
They are told that if they want a
little bottle of whiskey in case of
aleckless, it will be imilmssibhle for
them to get it. This is a flimsy
argument for any one who will keep
liquor for sickness cau always be
accommodated, for several ,ieigh
bors could go together and get a
case shipped to them and divide it
after it came. Another argtment
very commone is, that liquor in a
town draws trade. I knoew of
towns where no liquor is sold that
do a better business than they did
while liquor was sold fhere, and
men haul their cotton from. within
four miles of the liquor towns to
the dry ones. This ought to show
that liquor is not necessary to the
prosperity of a town. Mr. editor
you must not think because I am
speaking some plain truths in op.
position to liquor aellitg, that I am
a isratght laced fanatic on.religion
or uagrality. I speak from actual
knowledge of the evil effects of
liquor.
I have been a moderate drinker
agreat prtion of my life since
obut this only gives me
more knowledge of the curse of
@bs utd. If 1 now had the money
I have spent for liquor that did me
no good, I could ive my family

OBSERVER.
Thomas Jefferson says m his
writings:
"Corruption of morals in the
mass of cultivators is a phenome
non of which no a.e or nation has
ever furnished an example."
And we will add that the only
hope of this nation to.day is from
her farming classes. The popula
tion of cities and towns are becom
ing so corrupt, that it is almost
impossible to elect puro men to
office for such places. While the
cultivators of the soil remain pa
triotsc and free from corruption,
this republic will grow and pros
per. If they also should become
corrupt, our country would soon
go to pieces.-Town Talk.

the parish, whether they are in favor
of prohibition or not. will decline
ing to the polls.
But we most sincerely trust hat
Populist comnmissioners and others
will not, onil election day, stoop to
the old methods of bulhldozing, or
otherwise preventing any colored
man tronut voting when entitled to
do so, nor in any way assist in the
manipll:ition of votes, or stuffinug
of ballot-boxes. Populists must be
consistent and )ractice what they
preach about fair elections.
Let us have a free vote and a
fair count, and lot the full blame
of using the colored vote rest on
those who are guilty of it.
Iloke Smith and his man Friday,
alias Claude Bennett, got quite a
little snurb Monday.
Heretofore the Secretary of the
Interior has been allowed a Pit
vate Secretary, as a sort of per
sonal laquey,-at the expense of
the tax payers.
Mr. Smith installed the said
Claude into that position, and
promptly called on Congress to
raise the salary.
There is no law authorizing this
office at all.
This fact is admited, but up to the
lresent time the salary has beent
paid out of the tax money of the
peol)le "as a courtesy to the Sec
retary."
It so happened that Mr. Smith
andt his gorgeous private Secretary
have made many personal enemies,
and hence it chanced that when
the bill appropriating money for
the expenses of the Interior De.
partment came around, at this ses
ston, Delegate Flynn of Oklahoma
moved to strike out the $2,000 sal
ary, on the ground that there was
no law authorizing the expendi
ture.
The point was of course sustain
ofd, and out the item went.
Does that mean tuat Claude will
not get the money or that Smith
will have it to pay
Not at all.
It simply means that foke Smith
must come down off his high horse,
mollify Delegate Flynn by acced
ing to some demand heretofore re
fused, and that then, when the two
politicians have adjusted their dit
ferences, the $2,000 item will be re
stored to its usual place in the bill.
Just wait and see if it dosen't
turn out that way.
Bless you, we've been there and
seen how they do it.
"As a courtesy."
Just think of $2,000 paid every
year, without warrant of law, "as
a courtesy" to a Democratic or Re
publican office-bolder.
Of course one such "courtesy"
becomes a precedent for hundreds
of others, and in this polite man.
ner the tax-payers are looted of,
mdllions of dollars every year.-Ta
