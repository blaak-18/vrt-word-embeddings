TJ7E ADVERT1SER'S CAR
TOON7.
Some time ago the Advertiser
likened the editor of The Gazette to
an insect. We remonstrated with
our esteemed contemporary for be
ing so unkind. We said many
things that were calculated to soothe
and not to hurt his feelings. Not
to be offensive we referred to him,
not as an insect, but as a rare bird;
one of those sea-tossed messengers
fr roreign shore. He didn't
o o being classed with the
feathery tribe and we naturally
came to the conclusion that we had
correctly classified him. But we
have to take his word in the absence
of better proof that we were mis
taken. In the last issue of his
great pictorial weekly he printed a
picture. It is one of those exquis
ite productions of his esthetic mind
and skilled hand. He was generous
enough to draw the picture of a
poor, little dog which he labeled
"Gazette." But genius is erratic,
and the ordinary mind can not
grasp its eccentricities. In drawing
our picture, in a moment of
thoughtlessness not uncommon in
men of superior intellectual facul
ties, the artistic editor perhaps by
mechanical operation, but we rather
believe to be true to nature, drew the
likeness of an animal famous in his
toric record, and which inspired
the inimitable pens of a .Esop and
LaFontaine, to illustrate in their
fables the folly and stupidity of
some of our own kind. There is no
question that the picture of the ass
which graced the editorial page of
theAdvertiser is a splendid speci
men of the genus Equus. When
-our worthy confrere was drawing
'with rapturous pleasure what pur
ported to be a likeness of The Ga
zette, his hand, accustomed to the
mysteries of his art, made a perfect
counterpart of the Advertiser.
The. cut representing Mr. Ran
dolph's mule has all the master
touches of the, artist and would
adorn the.pages of Puck or Judge.
The animal as appears from
the length of his hind legs
and theh,.hight to which they
are pitched, is a brisk and high
kicxer. The morbid and inveterate
habit of our contemporary to kick
in the air at every election is well
taken off in the cut. The only ques
tion which we found difficult to
solve was whether the animal was
indigenous to our soil or of im
ported stock. However the x-ray
appearing at the bottom of the cut,
furnished sufficient light on the sub
ject and dispelled any doubt that
may have existed in our mind con
cerning the nationality of the ani
mal, and we have reached the con
clusion that under the present
system of public education no
American mule of ordinary intelli
gence would have been guilty of
spelling the name of the illustrious
Virginian with an "f," and we are
now of the opinion that the cut
represents a genuine imported ass.
Truck farming is increasing in
Louisiana, and there is no reason
why this State should not become
the winter and spring market gar
den of the Mississippi Valley.
When it comes to frish potatoes,
erreambers, onions, cabbage, etc.,
we must have just the varieties in
popular demand, packed just as
buyers want them and ready for
.market when, competing countries
are not ready to' oder these prod

WILL NOT HIRE ANYONE.
The announcement made by
Sheriff Broussard that he would ex
ecute the Blanc brothers without
the aid or services of a hangman,
- should meet with the approbation
of all right-thinking people. While
on this subject the following from
the Baton Rouge Truth is apropos:
*'The Secretary of State, Hon.
Jno. T. Michel, a short time since
received a letter from Taylor, the
hangman, requesting that when the
Governor signs warrants for the ex
ecution of criminals in various par
ishes that he would fix a different
date for each, in order to enable
the writer to do a wholesale busi
ness. He says he is an adept and
never bungled a job, although he
has sent many a poor wretch into
the presence of his God. He also
suggests that at the next session of
She Legislature a law be enacted
providing for an official State exe
cutioner, and that he receive the
appointment. 'This is a strange
ambition, and shows plainly to
what depth of brutality human na
ture can sink. He is a man of ex
cellent traits, so we are told, other
wise than his desire to make a small
amount of money out of the death
of a human being. We do not think
the law should permit such creat
ures to be employed, but should re
quire the sheriff and his regular
deputies to perform this disagree
able duty. There is something s.
repulsive in having to do with a
hireling hangman that every decent
man shrinks from the contact,
while no odium attaches to the per
formance of one's lawful duties. A
sheriff may execute a criminal with
out compunction or remorse, and
public sentiment would approve, as
it does in the case of a military
officer who commands a firing de
tail at the execution of a soldier.
It is the paid ruffian who is held in
abhorrence, and not the public
official."
A Sad Case.
St. Landry Clarion.
On last Saturday a little waif,
left by the fallen women in
their hasty flight from here, was
rescued from the hands of two ne
gro women in whose charge the
child had been left until its unfor
tunate parents could find a place
of abode. Not one seemed to
know of the child's presence in our
community until a colored girl re
ported the matter to Mrs. Raymond
Breaux last Saturday, adding that
the child was being whipped and
cruelly treated by the brutal
wenches. That evening Mr.
Charles Thibodeaux and Mr. Ray
mond Breaux rode to where the(
child was reported to be, but found
the house vacated. A scarch of
the neighborhood discovered the
child at the house of Napoleon
McBride, a neighbor, and it was
learned that the women who had
the child in charge were absent
from home that eventing. The waif,
who said he was five years old, was
interrogated, and the clear state
ment he made convinced us that
the story of his ill-treatment was
only too true. He said that not
only did the brutes .unmeicifully
whip him, but that often when he
was hungry he had to appeal to the
charity of McBride, the neighbor,
for something to eat, appeals which,
we are glad to pe able to state,
were never made in vain. No
amount of persuasion could induce
the little fellow to come without
Kitty's consent, crying and saying
that Kitty would "'beat" if he came
away. It was evident that he was
in great fear of Kit:ty (Kitty is the
woman who had him in charge) and
as that plug-ugly chunk of midnight
was not at home, the child had to ,
be left there until her return. That
night Dr. I. E. Shute, James J.
Lewis and Raymond Breaux re
turned to the house and got the
child, who was taken in charge by
Mrs. Breaux.
Upon undressing the little fellow
to wash him a sight to make a stout
heart bleed met the eyes. There,
upon the back bf the poor innocent
orphan, were great red stripes,
swollen and hard7 and in some
places the skin had been lacerated
and a scab had formed ! The child
explained that Kitty, the negr"ess,
took his clothes off to whip' htm;
and would stick pins in his hands !
Can there be anythmg more revolt
rg? Can a punishment too severe
be inflicted ow suich human brutes-?
On Monday an affidavit was
mwade before fudge Simon against
the woman Kitty, and she was
placed under $ioo bond to. appear
before the district court. Hut this
is not the punishment she deserves,
and there are but few communties
in which she would have gotten off
