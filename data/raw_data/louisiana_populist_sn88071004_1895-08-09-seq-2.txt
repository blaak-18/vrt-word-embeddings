PIgDAY, AUGUNT 9, 1995.
Through the courtesy of Hon.
A. Benoit, of Monroe, we have re
ceived a copy of the proceedings
and evidence of the Benoit vs.
Boatner, contest in the 5th Con
gressional District. Whether Mr.
Benoit wins or not, he has done his
party a great service in exposing
Democratic frauds in that District.
While Machen was inducing the
Populists of Grant parish, at Fair
field, on July 20th, to pass resolu
tions denouncing this poor sinner
and this paper, we (the said sinner)
were engaged in making a 2 hours
speech to the Populist club at
Campti, where last November Ma
chen disappointed a large audience
of Populists who he had promised
election.
He disappointed that crowd at a
time that was vital to the success
of the Populist ticket, because he
S had a headache, while we left home I
suffering with a burning fever, in I
order to do our duty to our party 1
and our principles.

The Tiumes-l)cinocrxt of Aug.
1st, deVoteS over two cohlmIns to
an acc'ount of the State nominating
conventionl of the Mistssippi Poip
Iulists, l hich held at Jackson, the
Capital, on July 31st, and was
largely attended, harmonious and
e nthuslastlc.
The Omaha platform was in
dorsed and a strong platform on
State issues of vital interest to
Mississippians was adopted.
The ticket gives entire satisfac
tion to the party in that State, and
is conceded by all to be a strone
one, the men composing being
prominent in the politics of the
State, consistent reformers, and an
honor to the cause they represent.
The ticket is as follows :
For Governor, C(apt. Frank
Burkitt, of Chickasaw ; Lieut. G(ov
ernor, S. W. Robinson, of Ran
kin: Secretary of State, R. R.
Bunting, of Tallahatchie; Attor
ney General, John J. D)ennis, of
Oktibuleha; Auditor, R. T. Love,
of Sunflower; Treasurer, C. W.
Bolton, of Pontotock; Superin
tendent of Education, A. Trotter,
of Clarke; Railroad Com., First
Dist., G. W. Dwyer, of Panola ;
Second Dist., N. M. Hollingsworth,
of Hinds; Third Dist., L. N.
Jackson, of Amite; Land Coin.,
N. C. West, Jr., of Carroll
State Revenue Agent, R. E. L.
Mitchell, of Alcorn; Clerk of the
Supreme Court, L. R. Collins, of
Jones.
Capt. Burkitt accepted the nom
ination in a lengthy speech, in
which he arraigned the Democrat
ic party for malfeasance and mis
feasance in office, and outlined the
policy of a Populist administration.
The Populists have a splendid
fighting chance in that State, are
well organized, and are putting up
a good tight.
Wiiarm.on, LA., July 30, '95.
IEd. Louisiana Populist:
Dear Sir and Bro.-I see pub
lished the proceedings of the Ex- 1
ecutive Committee of Grant parish. 4
1 must confess that I was much t
hurt and surprised to read such m
resolutions as was passed by that
meeting, denouncing you in the t
bitterest terms for your acts in ad- a
vocating the silver party, just as t
if you was the fatlier of it all, and 1
further denouncing all other Pop- t
ulists who did not at once get out, s
as traitors to the Populist party. I
Let me state to you again, that it 3
hurt me to see such men as A. W. I
Stewart's name signed to such res. I
olutions. t
I have been lying still, having E
but little to say about the silver i
question, while I was in favor of c
it, I feel sure that the Democrats
would back down just as they are J
doleg, but when I see such resolu- t
tions as the resolution passed at I
the Fairfiekld meetian, denouncing
the best men in our party and call
~bg them traitors to the party, Id
can't stand any such charges made a
ald headed by such menasM . F. c
Machei. Brothersm ad friends, I
ha me caml yod attention to a few
plain facts: Firnt m mt Win. par- t
sh considered the banner parish t
at the People's party of the State c
of ILouismia, then if this is the I
ease, who were the boys who had I
the ourage of their convictions,
and tok to e front and foughtyour
battles. Where dkid Hoe. I. ,. t
Brian, B. w. Bailey and ,J. H. t]
Crawlud, stand at the Idayette h
oombia; yesa, they ood"on ti
aide of the eople whom tleyrepre

that that was ome the times. c

ome It, the front and defend their
leaders until they shall have had a
Sfair impartial trial before the puIU
0 lic. I am sure that these acRused
g parties will meet M. F. Aachen
and all his friends on the stump.
.so that all people may hear anad
e understand, if they do not do it,
I will promise you that I then will
d help you to denounce themn. I did
not intend to open a fight against
M. F. Maclhen until I saw these
bitter charges. Now if Mr. Ma
n chen's hands was perfectly clean
0 then it would not look so terribly
had. Friends, you must remem
Ser. and most e.pecially such men
as (). I. HIarper, II. C. Mixon,
C. L. Purvis and others, who was
memlbers of the Board of D)irec
tors of the Winn parish Farmers
e Union Association, that I was pres
n ident of. I employed M. F. Machen
as an attorney for the association.
and gave him one hundred and
fifty dollars per year. and when
k the Natchitoches Bank brought suit
against the Association, that he led'
us to believe that we had a very
ha(l suit on hand, and was one of
the causes of my speaking to R. E.
Milling & Roberts, and he then,
f while we were in trouble, wanted
me, as president, to pay himt two
hundred dollars extra. Millin &
Roberts wanted $25m0 each, makingr
seven hundred in all, and he ad
vised me that it was best to employ
t Milling & Roberts at $500, and no
;ldouht we would have employed
them at that Board nleeting, had
not ,1. II. Crawford comle to the
meeting and raised objection to
the Board employing any counsel
at that time, and further stated
that he could get Mr. C. V. Por
ter of Natchitoches for less than
one third the amount, and we, the
Board of Directors postponed em
ploying any counsel until we could
Ssee further, but had an understand
ing that in case we saw that we
needed their help, we were to let
them know, and meet them on a
Wednesday, before the court con
vened on a Monday, and before
that time camne, J. II. Crawford,
1 myself, S. M. Barr and Thomas
D, rewitt, employed C. V. Porter,
· who took the case for less than one
third, and it made Machen mad, i
and he was the first man to make
out an account against the Asso
ciation for his services in the awove
mentioned suit, claiming that he
was employed at a salary of two
hundred dollars, and an additional
$280 as his part of the per cent
i that was recovered as damages,
I and then put it into the hands of
t one of the bitterest enemies that
I the Association had ; and suit was
at once brought, which has caused
t the xmor stockholders more trou
I ble, and is the whole cause of all
the trouble now. lie did not only
sue for the $200(, but brought suit
for $480. Now friends, before
you pass sentence on such men as 1
H. L. Brian, B. W. Bailey and J.
H. Crawford and others, who
think it best to make the next
State fight in a nonpartisan fight I
in order to try to get their votes
counted, you must remember that
Machon is a candidate for District C
Judge, and don't think that he can
be elected unless he is nominated
by the Populist party. This is I
why he is so bent on having nomi
nations, and he and his friends are
doing all in their power to force
all populists to vote for him (Ma- '
chin) if it burst the whole popu
list party wide open. t
Now my friends, I did not in
tend exposing M. F. Machen un
til he and his followers made such '
charges against Hon. H. L. Brian,
B. W. Bailey and J. H. Crawford. t
When I think what a hard battle
we have had to fight, and well do I
we know that Machen was as he C
thought, on the popular side in
the laYst fight, and the stand that "
he took against the Association,
and then to look where those par
ties stand whom these charges are
made PInst, it almost makes my
blood boil. While Machen was
charging enormous Attorney fees,
H. L. Brian, B. W. Bailey and
Crawford was mortgaging their t
little homes to borrow money to
pay up the debts of the Associa
tion, and while we know that Craw
ford L. D. Jones and B. W. Bai
ley, intended that Mache. should
have a fair show, and would have
supported himn, as he was all the
popuhatwe had, except Mr. L. B.
-Idley, that oould make the rae
the popolist'ticket. While we
Amow that be has made a failure n
