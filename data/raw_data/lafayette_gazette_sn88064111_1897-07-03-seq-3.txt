PUBLIC OPINION
Reflected in the Papers of this
Great State.
Some of our contemporaries are
continually reminding the public
that Senator Caffery is standing
squarely and with both feet upon
tne Democratic platform. It
would afford us pleasure to know
at what date he crawled upon it.
We have been laboring under the
impression that when the last
National Democratic platform was
adopted and put before the people,
Mr. Caffery repudiated it, and went
off to Indianapolis and joined in with
a little coterie in organizing a new
and distinct party, with the word
"national" as a prefix. If he has
ever since that date returned to the
fold, we have been woefully
neglectful in failing to note it.

"This country indeed needs more
liberty, more patriotism, more vir
tue. Party and pelf have usurped
the domain "of principle. Indi
vidal interest and ambition have
become paramount to the public
good. These thoughts and ideas
are not gerrain to isolated ex
pressions of oplrninr. They per
meate every int:llicnt mind and
have infused a spirit of iiitrust,
unrest and dissatisfaction among
the toiling masses. It is witnesse;i
in the great arteries of the trade
and commeinrce etruggii:ng to achieve
prosperity in vain. 't is pro
claimed by the in ,-'ri" ,nt indltustry
of the agricultural 1c:iier.-, who see
the sunbeams of the il!uionc: in
bounteous crops and forget the
robber combines and trusts that'
despoil them of the fruits of their
industry, and leave theca to grope in
the darkness and despair of penury,
want, spoliation and ruin. It is
only too :,pp:areutt in legislative

The Republican.' haive dr'nOpp.ed
the cry about a "free braeoakfast
table" for the poor man, and it is
rnot probable that they will ever
:;,i;: -.2;.i_. The poor roan has I
.tiscovered that the "free breakfast
table" is a!! rot. ,-i,: table c:oth is
taxed, the dish - are taaxed, the
knives and forks are tax;_., the in:
ber in the table and :he chaisr he
sits in is taxed. But this is not all.
Under the tariff bill, as ;t ;ias.es
the Senate, all of these taxes wit be
largely increased. ---Daily States,
I)em.
As far back as we can remember
since the days of \Varnioth and
Kellogg, the Republican party has
been divided into factionis, and t!he
good that its members or leaders
have ever done was tO hold the
Federal offices in Louisiana. In
stead of fighting the enemies, the
leaders have been figRhting each
other in order to get the Federal
plums. The lRepublican orgassiza
tion in this State has been kept up
and maintained through the schenm
Ing of men who have never been to
their homes for years, but have
resided in the city of New Orleans.
As far back as we can recall, there
has always existed in this State a
shell organization for the purpose
of perpetuating a ceftain class of
leaders into power, and give them
the first claim on the Federal of
fices.--St. Mary Herald, Rep.
Senator McEnery's unexpected
jump to the Republican ranks on
portions of the tariff question has
not set well on the stomachs of his
former friends and admirers in
North Louisiana. Truly it is get
ting to be quite impossible to tell
where the average politician of now
adays stands on matters of public
moment. If there be any man in
Louisiana whom the masses of the
Democratic party thought would
hold unflinchingly and firmly to
Democratic tenets and principles,
that man was S. D. McEnery.
But, alas ! his flop on the tariff
issue has almost caused a loss of
confidence in political leaders. -
