Depelv’s First Speech in Congress After His Exposure and Disgrace.
Railroads'Ulvned by the People:
Maybe your breakfast didn’t agree
with you this morning.
Forget it!
Ten to one, that note is coming
due next week.
Don’t worry!
Perhaps you got a letter from the
man who owes you, putting off set
tling day for another month.
Cheer up! ,
Perchance you are cast down be
cause cotton won’t go up.
Cut It out!
In a word, throw dull care to the
winds, side-step your troubles, put the
lid on your grouch, and come with me
to the upper realms of unrestrained
For I have a message for you that
will make a “come to my party” card
look like a summons for jury duty.
Now, “Listen, my children and you
shall hear” —not the midnight ride of
Pftul Revere —
A T'lelvspaper Debated to the Adbocacy of the Jeffersonian Theory of Gobernment.
Atlanta, Ga., Thursday, March 7, 1907.
/. H. REESE, Associate Editor Tallahassee (Ela.) Sun.
But a trumpet call to liberty, loud
er and clearer than the boldest blown
by Wallace, among Scotland’s crags,
and sweeter than the tunefulest lay
ever played on fairest planes by Apol
lo in her merriest mood.
The supreme court of Florida has
declared that the right of the people
of Florida to safe and prompt trans
portation of all commodities offered to
railroads, is superior to the right of
the railroads to declare dividends.
So fair a picture as this deserves
to be viewed on all sides.
Let’s look at it again.
In the opinion handed down last
week, in the A. C. L. mandamus case
the supreme court said:
“No matter that a dividend is never
paid, that the private investment is
sunk and worthless, that the interest
upon Its bonds is not met, and that
all Its creditors go unpaid, every dol
lar of its earnings must nevertheless
be applied to keep up its maximum
efficiency, as required by the political
power in the law which created it to
neglect of the smallest of these duties
in which the community is interested
will be enforced by the public writ of
mandamus.”
And in order that there should be
no lingering doubt to lay its bony
hand on the outward manifestation of
the exuberance of the joy that Alls
our souls to bursting, the honorable
court also said:
“The service rendered by a com
mon carrier directly and vitally af
fects the public. To have such serv
ice properly rendered is a beneficial
right which the public is entitled to en
joy. If the service is not properly ren
dered it causes loss and inconvenience
to the public, and perhaps endangers
the lives and property of all those to
whom it is extended; therefore, it is
a fundamental duty of the state to rig-
The Corporations that Manage Them are
the Trustees for the 'Real Olvners of Them
idly require a proper rendering of this
useful public service.”
Take that into the far corners of
your inner consciousness, let it soak
In, and then take it out and hold it in
your hand and squeeze down on it.
The railroads bound to keep their
roadbeds in first class condition, and
a writ of mandamus will make them
do it, or give up the franchise they
hold by gift from the people.
Please do not miss any of the
rare and tender and succulent bits
of this menu a la Fourth of July,
which our very honorable supreme
court has prepared for our soul’s
feasting. Here’s another:
“The road, once constructed, is, in
stanter, and by mere force of the
grant and law, embodied in the gov
ernmental agencies of the state and
dedicated to public use. All and sin
gular its cars, engines, rights of way
