that control the action
of the heart. When they
become weak, the heart
action is impaired. Short
breath, pain around heart,
choking sensation, palpi
tation, fluttering, feeble
or rapid pulse, and other
distressing symptoms fol
low. Dr. Miles Heart Cure
is a medicine especially
adapted to the needs of
these nerves and the mus
cular stziicture of the
heart itself. It is a
strengthening tonic that
brings speedy relief.
Try it.
“For years I suffered with what I
thought was stomach trouble, when
the doctors told me I had heart
trouble. I had tried many remedies,
when the Dr. Miles’ almanac came
into my hands, and I concluded to
try Dr. Miles’ Heart Cure. I have
taken three bottles, and now I am
not suffering at all. I am cured and
this medicine did it. I write this in
the hope that it will attract the at
tention of others who suffer as I did.**

THE PETTIGREW DISPATCH.
(Continued from Page Six.)
Senator in his state (South Dakota).
But he got left. He is an Ex. He
never was a reformer in any sense of
the word. Mr. Watson in replying to
Pettigrew’s statement says Bryan has
had Pettigrew to make the statement
because Watson is showing Bryan up.
Even if Pettigrew’s statement is true
it doesn t reflect in the least on
W atson—it was merely a matter be
tween Pettigrew, the former Republi
can, then a Bryanite, but never a Pop
ulist, and the Republican committee.
Hie following press dispatch gives
Mr. Watson’s statement in relation to
what Pettigrew has said:
Atlanta, Ga., Sept. 29.—1 n reply to
the charges of ex-Senator Richard
F. Pettigrew that the Republicans
offered Pettigrew SIO,OOO four years
ago to make speeches for Watson,
Thomas E. Watson issued this for
mal statement today:
The reason why Mr. Bryan has
put forward Pettigrew to attack me
is that my exposures of Bryan’s
deals with the negro leaders and with
saloon interests of Maine, Indiana and
Ohio are hunting the Peerless. Their
deals are disgraceful and ought to be
exposed. The Bryan policy on the
negro question threatens calamitous
consequences to the South and
endangers the result of thirty years
of work to establish white supremacy
and therefore, I set it a duty to
expose and denounce it. As to Petti
grew, I shall not notice him further
than to say that if anybody ever
offered him SIO,OOO for ten speeches
on any earthly subject the man who
made the offer was more liberally
supplied with money than sense.
In 1904 I made my campaign for
the principles which the presiden
tial ticket of Bryan and Watson
advocated in 1896. Bryan had de
serted his principles and had gone
over to the gold standard men. The
Populists called on me to take up
the Jeffersonian propaganda where
Bryan had left off and I did so. Re
publican money had nothing to do
with it.
In my speeches and my letter of
acceptance I hammered both old par
ties with strenuous impartiality. The
speeches are of record and show for
themselves. Whether the Roosevelt
managers gave financial aid to those
who managed the Populist campaign
I neither know’ nor care. Everybody
who knows a thing about it is well
aware of the fact that the campaign
funds of both the old parties come
from practically the same source.
The beneficiaries of class legislation,
the national bankers of the money
centers, the Wall street element of
both leading parties—these are con
tributors to campaign funds, and we
all know it.
Bryan well knows that the party
campaign fund of 1904 was raised
by the Wall street element of his
party. He said so time and again
in public speeches and written edi
torials. Yet, he himself did not hes
itate to use that campaign fund. It
was the money of Ryan and Belmont
which paid for the luxurious special
train employed by Bryan in his cam
paign for Parker. According to
Bryan himself the source of the cam
paign fund of Judge Parker was cer<
Jeffersonian
tainly not less tainted than was that
of the campaign fund of Roosevelt.
Bryan’s own brother and brother-in
law got $15,000 of the Parker funds
and violated the law of Nebraska by
their failure to render an account of
what went with it. That $15,000
came from August Belmont and
Thomas F. Ryan, two of the most
notorious corruptionists, and although
Bryan said that he would refund the
money, he has not done so.
Before Bryan fires off his man
Pettigrew at me again he had better
do one of two things, either disgorge
Ryan and Belmont’s $15,000 or ex
plain what became of it.

A LAST VAIN EFFORT.
The Charleston News and Courier,
which, ever since the nomination at
Denver, has been engaged in frantic
efforts to raise money for the Bryan
campaign fund, and which has se
cured only seventy-five cents inde
pendent of the raffle it pulled off on
the Gander and Hen which the Ob
server sent it, is now demanding the
placing of a contribution box at each
polling place in the State when the
second primary on the senatorship is
held, expressing the belief that the
electorate will contribute a penny
each, making a fund of SI,OOO. It is
no use. It has been amply demon
strated that the tight wads of South-
Carolina. are not going to give up any
thing.—'Charlotte Observer.
