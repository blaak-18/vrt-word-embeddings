THE RETURNING BOARD.
[From f.lio N O. Bulletin, of t.lic 24th.]
At nboiit. II o'clock Ilm Hoard wns cull
ed to order, all the tncinlir.ru present.
Mr. Arroyo linked Informal,Ion n* to (lie
return on the communication wnt by tho
Secretin, v of Hie Hoard, l >y tlio order of the
Hoard, to the Commissioner of DeSoto
Parish, rei|ucstiug him tosend ill hisstate
mcnt of votea
The Secretary reported Unit the letter
had been dispatched on Saturday, hut that
no answer had beeil received.
No further action on the mutter *vnn ta
ken, the Hoard decided to allow further
time for the receipt of an answer.
The question of In formalities in the sev
eral wards of the cit.v was then taken up,
and Mr. .lohn Ray. of the itcpuldicaii Com
mittee, liled Iiis brief, which in substance
took the stand that tlm election law was
passed to prevent fraud and secure a fai
expression of the voice ofthe peuple ; that
to this end certain formalities to he com
plied with were laid down ; that the vio.
iation of any of the formalities was evi
deuce of fraud, and if allowed to stand, a
precedent for the violation of all ; and
that the Hoard was nctiniç under the law.
and must see that all the provisions of
the law were carried out.
in fact, the <|iicHtioii was narrowed down
to one of technicalities.
The document woundup with the fol
lowing statement "of the polls at which
the forms of law were not complied with,
and the particulars iu which t he forms of
law were not complied with:"
« # ♦ »
It will be seen that almost the entire
vote of the city is ouestioned on the
ground of informality in the returns.
Iii reply, Mr. /neharie read the argu
ment of the committee us to the powers
and duties of the Returning Hoard pre
pared by the Democratic Committee,
which has already been published.
The contest of Toll f> Seventh Ward,
was called and Mouette, the Radical com
missioner, was brought tor wind to the
stand. Under formal protest it was sta
ted,and iu his direct examination ho sta
ted, that there was intimidation at the
poll, and that under this intimidation lie
signed a, list of voters and stiitement of
voters. Iii his cross-examination by Mr.
Zaeliarie, he snid that he knew of ui( man
that was entitled to vote that had \heeu
prevented from voting; that, he signed
proper returns (show to him) on the 3d of
November of his own free will and ac
cord, which, were deposited with tlio Sec
retary ot the State ; he believed tlieui to
be correct.
I
:
retary ot the State ; he believed tlieui to
be correct.
(Tim papers signed voluntarily corres
ponded wit h those signed, as alleged, lin
ier compulsion.) That he would not; have
signed after the close of the polls if not in
timidated, heeanse the list of voters was
missing. That the intimidation com
plained of was loud talk on the streets.
The returns which the Hoard were in
possession of were compared with those
turned in to tlm Secretary of the Slate,
ami found to correspond.
Hernard Lusto. Assistaut, Supervisor,
said that the poll was opened after the
appointed time, twenty minutes after <>
lock ; that there was a crowd of men :it.
the poll ; that they made a rush, iind that
the Commissioners were compelled to in
civil votes before they were organized ;
(lint on ii man who was going out hunting
insisted on being allowed to vote, and
was violent ; there was some dillieull v in
finding Ills name; lie hud his registration
papers: he was not allowed to vote until
his mime was found, and it. was not
I hrougli fear t hat they allowed him to vote.
Tlley kept no list of voters until Inilf
past nine o'clock, when Judge Salomon
•aine i-t nnd frightened l item so (hat they
took a man by the name of Collins to keep
the lisl. Salomon had hjiî. I if they did not
take Collins lie would sec about it. The
poll-list was kept until :i o'clock when
it whs destroyed, and a new one made by
Mouette and t Im Democratic commissioner.
This list was signed before the box was
opened. A printed list of voters was on
hand, auo the names were scratched us
thé pill-lies voted. This list was placed in
the hal!ot-hox.
Mr. I .eon ilolzat, Democratic Commis
sioner, said he was at the poll at (» o'clock
in I lie looming, and that if. was half-past,
Ii before the other commissioners came.
That a man who was going hunting was
rather impatient because his name could
not be loiiuil. He used no voiJelico or
threats. .Judge Salomon did lint compel
the commissioners to take Collins. II«.
said there must be a clerk, ami suggested
Collins to witness as a clerk, and wit
accepted hlni. Monet to administered the
oath to Collins, and did not object to it.
Mouette chose a clerk, a man by the name
of Du par|„ and it was Popart's fault that
the error that led to the destruction ofthe
first list and the making of the second one
was made. There was no intimidation
at all
The box of this poll was sent for, and
the printed list of voters found to tally
with (hose before the Hoard took the briefs
ofthe two commit tecs under considérât ion,
and after mature deliberation decided to
ignore mere technical Informalities, and
"compile" the vote of the city as canvass
ed. .They will 110 doubt be promulgated
to-day. After this a recess was taken un
til (I o'clock the Hoard re-assembled, and
after canvassing the parishes of Jclicrson
and St. Charles adjourned until H o'clock
to-day.
From the Evening HuHctin.
There was a m an fest feeling of re
lief on tlio part of several members of
the board this morning, consequent on
the promulgation of tlio returns ofthe
parish of Orleans. There seemed to
be a sort of inner self-congratulations
by eacli member, which was so great
that it even stole out, ami was sileutl.y
extended to every other member, anil
the board, as a whole, was the hap
piest board imaginable, and went to
work 011 the other parishes as if their
task was an entirely new one, just
commenced.
The returns of the city officers as
officially promulgated correspond with
the statement published iu the Bulle
tin of Sunday, with the exception of
three or four votes, one way or the
other, in several instances.
The clerks were tlio only persons in
attendance on the board who did not
seem contented.
The lfturns from the First and Se
cond Congressional Districts bothered
and occupied them. It is <*xpected
that their compilition will beconplcted
to-day, and that they will lie officially
promulgated in thp morning.
There can bo no doubt of tlio fact
that the Supervisors of Plaquemines
parish, with scarcely

pertaining to order and neatness, for

tlial have ever been passed by uny Re
turning Hoard.
At II o'clock all tlio members were
present and tlio Hoard was called to
order.
Mr. Arroyo called tlio attention of
tlio board to tlio fact that tlio returns
from
1)k boto karistl
Iind not, yet been received, although it.
was well known that they had been in
the city for some time. Tliero was con
siderable talk about efforts being made
to pell them, and it was time the board
came into possession of them. Ho of
Cored as the last resort of the board to
got them, the proposition contused in
tlio following resolut ion:
itemlvcd , That the president of the
Hoard bo requested to iustituto legal
proceeding beforo tlio Superior Dis
trict Court of tlio parish of Orleans in
order to obtain from the Assistant Su
pervisor of Registration, in aud for the
parish of DeSoto, the election returns,
tally sheets, and such other documents
necessary, in order to complete tlio re
turns of said parish, with the view of
their canvass and compilation.
Wells did not think that tlio Hoard
was authorized to net in the manner
set forth, and besides, if it was, it was
probable such proceedings would not
effect the desired end. If the matter
got into the courts it would stay there
for a year.
A majority ftf tlio Board coincided
with the sentiments of Mr. Wells, and
the resolutions was tabled subject to
call.
At the suggestion ot Ray and the
Republican committee, a rule that no
protest in any Ward would be received
until that Ward was under considera
tion, was established, and the action
in thus establishing it, adhered to not
withstanding the objection of Mr.
YVhitukcr.
The suggestion ofjIMr Whitaker that
the returns for the remaining parishes
betaken up by Congressional Districts
having been disposed ol by Wells, who
expressed tlio opinion that the Board
should adhere to its plan to proceed al
phabetically. Tlio returns from As
cension wero found and were under
consideration when this report closed.
