; For some weeks pest th.e (4ucnuian
has been running an advertisement of
the Swamp A ngel Company. We had
nt.t given it very much attention, and
%%hile we had sati.fied ourselves tistit
wan a good medicine, we had no true
ide.a of its real value. From direct
evidence we can affirm to any onein
terested that this medicine is possibly
what has long been lookedtfr. We
phould be slow to make this aseertion
,but for the fact that some strong testi
mnouials hrme come under. oqr notide
and we here present them. "The orig

Well, it was this Watkins who
addlressed the 1,Pops att Alexandria.
Thle Insider admllires his norn e anid
envies him the pi,,scsjion of such
gall. If The Insider only had this
gift of ctliro.itery, he would have
been United States senator long
ago. Our Pop friends did not lis
ten to Watkins-a prKoof that they
have memlories and consciences.
Next on the list of envoys was
Dan Scarborough. of Natchitoches.
Dan's convictions are built like
the figure S-they are not straight
anywhere. His thinking machine
works in curves, and he never
hurts anylxsly's feelings. lie has
no harsh word for the militia, that
stole his home parish of Natchito
ches from the Populists, nor does
he condemn the Pops who wdre
robbel. Dan is always in the nmid
dle of the road when an issue cillIes
up that is dangerous--he ncver
takes the righ or left folk. 1)ani-l
wants harmony and ieacc-fydil
sothing for Dan.
The third envoy WIS .'ili, Foster,
of Caddo, James thinks Pl'pli-t.+
are like caterlpilhars-thay should
le exterminated. Polison will do
-if it is the cheapest. If, howev
er, he can utilize the Pops as a
sort of Denmocratic fertilizer, he
believes it will pay when the ,crolp
of votes is gathered in November. -
But the "one-gallused" Ioys would
not listen to hin i at Alexandria-- "
he was on a cold trail. The, ma
chine in Caddo is said, lwever, to
he still in good working order and
there is no reason why Jiin FIostor
shouldl despair. It's :all in the
count, anyway.
Ed. Hunter, the district judge
of his neck of the woods. was an
other Populist-loving Iencoora
He wanted to drive them all into
the Gulf of Mexico six inoths ago,
but now he has revised his ijudg
ntent.- - The horny-handed are need

Hunter and Fostcr must hafo

('reait quantities of buttons a&
well as billiardl balls are made from
potlatoes. It is not generally known
that if thile substance if tline cilm
mon potato be treated with certain
acids it becolmes almost as hard
as stone, and can be used for
many pnrpose for which horn,.
ivory andl bone are emplloyett. This
quality of the potato adapll4it to
button making, and ai very goaod
grade of btionlls is now made from
the well known tuber. The pot4t
button can not be distiugbiL'
from the others save L. - *
examinatiol, and evertUuen only
by an expert, since it cau be oetor
ed to suit the goods on which it is
to be used. It is every whit as
good looking as a button of bone
or ivory. The cheapness is a great
recoammendation, ald will no doubt
lead to a much larger employment
in the tature.
Tt man is not much of a popu
