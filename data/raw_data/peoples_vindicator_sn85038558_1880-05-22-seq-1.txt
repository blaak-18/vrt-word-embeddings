Of days which hold no are.

Ecehanted with scenes that delight me
Whers'er I may turn my eyes. a
I have saiton-yea, by the dozen- t
KIeellng so low at my feet, I
While pride I my bemr runs riot, c
And the etsf triumph in sweet. a
Isl qeu in a lordly astle,
With servants at my command, I
And easeand comfort and pleasure
Close within reb of my hand. I

For John isoming; and, hark! l
