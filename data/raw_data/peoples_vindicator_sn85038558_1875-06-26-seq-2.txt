A REIIfNISSENCE 5ROnI PRIVATE HIS
TORY.
Itor.
Last week we published the com.
nients of the Chicago Tribune upon
the account given by Steadman, an
c. officer of the English army, in a work
written by him entitled "History of
the Origin, Progress and Termination
gf the American War," of the Ar
a nold--Andre treason and execution.
The views taken by the Author of the
ro0 above mentioned work, of the part
35 eli acted by Andre. in that notable and
0 historic treason of Arnold is such as
o oo should be expected from a friend or a
u5 iN partizan--the conduct of Washington
is mentioned as being barbarous and
re of contrary to the usages of christian or
,be. civilized warfitre, and the guilt of
Andre and culpability of Washington
rt. is attempted, by declaring and at
er tempting to prore, it is but a poor at
tempt, however, that Andre was cov
ered by the protecting folds of a flag
of truce during the interviews with
'200 Arnold, and that flag should also
have protected him on his journey to i
Tarrytown, on which he was captur
ed. We do not propose to argue that
point, for we consider the proposi
tion such a one as no person would I
hed adduce, if he considered his veracity
real of any weiglht. But we wonder that
re the Chicago Tribune, a journal whose
editors are supposed at least, to be
uit, thoroughly conversant with the his E
be tory of the interesting period referred
to, should not have demolished the
beautiful structure this Elfglish officer i
had reared as English history.
to Public opinion, as well as legal
courts, is prone to overlook infrac- e
$3 tions of its-laws by parties who do so 1
$ unworthily-they are merciful to, and r
ms sometimes condone, offences colm
"mitted for the first time, upon-the
ground that the parties eommitting, li
had no knowledge they were quilty ti
of a crime, and were therefore, if not
hi law, at least in mercy, fit objects C
ng for' a charitable example. Military
to law, as in the case of Andre, in which
for the circumstances of the "flag of
ial truce;" his instructions to remain in
uniform; his pass from Arnold, com
manding the defenses of West Point
and the Tarrytown lines, &a., would -
have suspended its extreme rigors at
the calls of mercy for so youthful,
brilliant and high officer in the army,
as Major Andre, but this was not the ai
case ; the first ofeence cannot be plead Yl
le for him, on the contrary, he seemed tI
to have had a penchant for the bnui- hI
ness of the spy. This is a serious
charge we well know, but it seems ai
B strange that the student of American ti
history should be so ignorant of such C,
e, fixed and proven facts. M
Ml We produce from "Johnsons Tra
ditions of the Revolution," a stand- W
Sard authority for historians, (see Los- t
sings Field notes of the revolution) Di
which is also eoroborated by John- of
son (not the same author named here) to
Id in his life of Green, and the followinag
a- extracts in relation to Andre's acting hi
Sas a spy during the siege of Charles
ton, in 1780, then in command of Gen.a
Lincoln; with the hope that other
o journals who have a leading circola- is
. tion, will give the matter investiga
tion as a matter eof record for our
centennial time next year. Andre
was a brave man, an ambitions sol-. f
Sdier, and took upon himself many
duties not eonsistant with dignity
, and high honor, to advance him in
' the eyes of his sovereign, and this e
would ,tend as cors oboration: of the
k facts here menttioned.
wi
SIn this visit, of my fither to the 1he
city above alluded to, he called to see
a sick friend, Stephen Shrewabory,
,I at the house of his brother, Edward am
SShrewesbury, in the same neilhbor pli
hood. There he saw a strangerdress. wh
I ed in homespun, -laslked Edward
a Slnrewabury wlho thati was, and was
told by him thabit time stranger was a th
SbacL-countryman, wlho had broughtlon
B idown cattle for thegarrison, to the loi
. opposite side of the river. Thi an
s.wer being prompt a4 planusible, i
nothing imore wau tbonght of tht cir- 1
Scauntatance. About eighteen months gre
after this, when my father having can
been exchanged, had returned frdm
his coenfemlent in St. Auguntine, r
Smet his friend, Stephen Shbrwabury,
oi Philadelplia. This was shortly
iafter thle discovery of Arold's trewa
s On, and the excution of Wajor An

n4 whose meass of Liowa tieq'r oar
muclh greater, who was in Charleston
during the siege, and remained in it
CIS' until the evacuation, who will testify
to the truth of this assertion. And
this opinion is corroborated by the
om- following fact: There were two
pon brothers of the name of 8. S. and E.
S., both well known as men of pro
perty and respectable standing in so
ork ciety. The former was, to the last,
y of faithfully devoted to the cause of his
tion country, the other was disaffected.
Ar- During the siege, 8. 8. being taken
n sick, was permitted to go to his
ion. brother's house to be better attended.
the There lie was introduced to, and re
)art peatedly saw a young man in a home
and spun dress, who was introduced to
him by his brother as a Virginian,
as connected with the line of that State,
r a then in the city. After the fill of
ton Charleston, he was introduced to
nd Major Andre at his brother's house,
and in him recognized the person of
i or the Virginian whom lie had seen du
of ring the siege. This he conmunica
ton ted to his brother, who acknowledged
at- him to be the same, asserting his
own ignorance of it at the time.
a ,t- S S. related these facts to many
ov- persons in his lifetime, and his ve.
lag racity was unquestionable. Another
ith citizen, W. J., at the time of Andre's
capture, a prisoner in St. Augustine,
iso also saw the supposed Virginian at
to the house of E. S., while .. S. lay
ur- sick, and his rqeollection of the fact
hat was revived by S. 8., after he had
made the discovery of his real charac- 1
ter. It is also known that the life of
id E.S. was sought after by Marion's
ity men, on the charge of treachery."
mat The initials only are given by the au
thor, although lihe was personally well t
e acquainted with all the parties. He t
be concealed the name of the disaffect
is ed, (probably) treacherous brother,
ed from a respect for his only child, a
very amiable, worthy lady, then t
alive, but who died in 1844. None of I
!er Edward Shre sbhnrv's family are now
living. -This lady left no children.
There is no longer a motive for con e
;al cealment of the facts and Circumstan- e
IC- ces. The very house in which Major
so Andre was secretly entertained dn
nd ring the siege of Charleston, may
still be seen. It was at that time, n
and many years after, the dwelling o
le of Edward Shrevwsnbury. It is the fi
g, brick house now used as a kitchen to ,
ty the residence of Mr. Edward Bull, p
ot No. 134, on the east side of East Bay, o
opposite to the residence of General p
C. C. Pinckney.

y, We are pained to chronicle the first tc

!d the call for the negroes to assemble ti
i- here, it looks ominous indeed. pi
at Upon last Sunday night a party of in
is armed and mounted negroes, some w
n thirty in number, "rode a raid" down ti
Cane river, visiting the plantation of r
Mr. Leon Dufilbo; their gets were le
outrageous in the extreme. His fences dt
were tomrn down; gates nnhinged, to
stock driven in his felds to destroy, w
) no doubt, his growing crop, and some
of his cabins, occupied by his hands,; ji
, totally demolieshed, the contents ta- d
ken off, &e. This visit was renderedl wI
Shideous by yells, firing off pistols and so
guns; in fact, the entire minutia of

Blunt appears in a card in the Nat
ehitoches Republican of last week in
t which, leaving aside the personal in
tent of it in referring to an editorial
in the Vindicator as "a card from the
editor," le assumes two roles at once,
that of a suppliant and of a bully. a
The editorial in the Vindicator to g
which he pathetically refers, does not, a
at to our mind, deter him from doing as d
at he sees fit in the matter of the negro C
an mass meeting; no ode desires to de
le ter him from organizing, drilling and
putting in trim his clans-we only b
if indulged in a little friendly warning
ie which we see was thrown away upon
'n that individual ; in truth, the whole k

e lessons of the past, but propose, on-.

rents Gentlemen-In your issue of Sun
lotlh day, June 2tth, appears the follow.
ti the ing:
war, "Col. Wm. M. Levy, Congressman
t elect from this District, is said to have
ie to recently made the following state
d, at ment to a correspondent of tie Cin
riest cinnati Enquirer:
lire Gen. Sherman voluntarily, unequi
vocally ind unconditionally pledged
w himself in the most binding manner
land not tofight on either side during the
for- war. The day before the occasion I
ving refer to, Col. Sherman, in company
as to with myself and Gen. Bragg, while
thiking a drink at the St. Charles bar,
fhis made the same pledge in unmistak- j
I up. able terms. Ilis strongest desire in
o, parting was to leave an assurance
but that he had no enmity, and would I
not participate in the tight. It was
son, an opinion among many that Sher
you man's policy was to retire until the
thing was over, then return and re
ren- same his old place at the military I
school, which hIe could have done, as t
who Ire was regarded as a very valuable
this man for that position."
tter I deem it my duty to correct this
"statement" in-as-much as it is a mis
rast understanding or misapprehension of 1
a as the facts of the case, and I am unwil- 1
ie," ling that my name should be connect
r all ed with aught that does injustice to a
mc- another.
in I have frequently, in private inter
an. course, spoken of my relations with
and Gen. Sherman while lihe had charge a
re. of the Louisiana State Seminary of
ern Learning and resided in Rapides Par
the ish, but must have been greatly mis
ith- understood, if, from any remarks of a
rth- mine, it has been deduced that Gen.
Sherman ever "voluntarily, unequir- i
we ocally and unconditionally pledged
rse- himself in the most binding manner
ose not to fight on either side during the
ren war."e
lie, I saw a good deal of Gen. Sherman
ad just before the war, and had frequent fe
,it conversations with him, and was m
greatly impressed by lis earnestness m
and uneasiness of feeling in the dis- hi
in cussion of the probable result of the i
secession movement.
I was an ardent advocate of seces- et
tsion, both on principle and policy- di
Hie was ardently and, I believe, sin- w
cc, ceroly, opposed to it, on the same an
grounds-I well remember a solemn S4
ot, and saddped expression of his opin- re
ion, just after the adoption of the or
dinance of secession, by the Louisiana
t Convention, to tie effect, that peace
able secession was impossible, and a
terrible internecine war was inevita
hg ble, the magnitude of which, he
ig thought, was not appreciated by us
of the South, but which, from his a
no knowledge of Northern sentiment, he
professed to foresee. He expressed
Shimself most grateful for te kindness t
e and hospitality whliclh had been ex
tended to him by the oedals and t
private citizens of our State, and th
stated, on morea than one occasion, t
at that in view of the terrible struggle th
which he believed was imminent and
d inevitable, he wished to retire to some
e quiet home in the West where he
e might not be called upon to partici
Mr pate in it, or even witness its horrors. je
SI certainly construed Ge.. Sherman's n
le remarks as indicative of a desire to
abstain from active participation in ti
the war, but not as pledgusg J Lself
- notto take part in it. It s due to f
Shim tostate that I saw him last(be- b
' fore the war) but a short time afterl
the passage efSeeession Ordinance of
g Louisiana, and these conversations
Swere had, if my memory serves me
ir aright, at least a month or six weeks
' before the ommencement of actual
hostilities. What eanme may have
*I operated to chbange hise views, as un- n'
derstood by me, I have no mansa of
s knowing. tw
ig Since the asurrender, I have seen g
e. an. Sherman but once, and then a
v. our interview was casual and our con. tr
SvrersatiOn cursory. My ante-bellam stil
m relations with him. have not been a
in renewed. IHEs military menos and

r We have been informed that the
depredations of the negroes down Del
Cane river have been of nightly co
eurrence for the past two weeks. w
SFences have been put down, gates Jur
Sunbhinged and stock driven in upon to
the farms to destroy the growaing t
Screps. We bhave a piece of advice to
- give our citizens with regard to this, loe
and we think they had better follow thu
it. Courts are useless to protect to
them from such depredations as lthese,
Slet patrol parties be organased in each sei
Snelghborhood, and the first parties and
that are captured should be hung up

One of General Sherman's Blun
ders.
From the Bobst Doaiy Arettaeir.
He takes strange liberties with
IAn- Ameriean history, early and recent,
low. which can only be explained by the
fact that le has lived so long abroad
that he has forgotten ft. For in
man stance, speaking in the first ten pages
aave of the contrast between the cavaliers
ate- who settled Virginia and the Puritans
Din- who took refuge in New England, he
says of the latter, that, "having
0ui- hearts of rock and granite also, they
Iged had to struggle against the rigor of
ner the elements, after hamving suffered so
the much from the rigor of their fellow
en I ereatures. Persecuted, they found
any there a society of persecutors. The
hile exile of Roger Williams, and the
bar, hundreds of poor sorcerers who were
ak- burnt there, are sad proofs of this."
In The story of course, is utterly ground
uce less. No human being was ever
old burned in New England for witch
was craft or sorcery.
't Does the Adrertiser calmly and
re- without the intention to joke, mean
ary to say that witches were not persecn
as ted and executed in New England in
ble the early days of the Puritan fathers,
if they were not, then Cotton Mather
has been a hoary-headed deceiver,
Iof and all history lies most agregiously.
They may not have been burned, but
et they were hang, which amounted to
about the same thing to the witches,
although the Boston Adrertiser finds
some consolation in the fact. Read
Or
ith up the solemn history and then you
will find out all about it; why the ,
rge affair is set down in Waiter Scott's
Demonology and History of Witch
ar- craft, as one of the most diabolical
of diabolical persecutions, and we
of are utterly astonished at the utter de
". pravity of the Advertiser in attempt
Sfog to deny a fact so plainly suscep

he From the Ouaelhita Telegraph we
extract the following:
an What is up now? A num ler of
nt leading Republicans of this aid the
fourth congressional districts held a
as meeting in New Orleans about a i
.s month ago (the proceedings of which
is- have just appeared), at which it o
he was declared that "the important a
interests of the State and Federal s
government, reader it eiinently prop- t
s- er that tie Republicans of the said a
districts should call a convention do- a
ring the present year," to be held t,
within the limits of the two districts t
ae and at a time to be determined on. ii
in Several parishes, it is claimed, were ii
n- represented at the meeting. Col. a
Âº- John Bay presided. e
u Coley Pierson and others, will be ii
e- delegates to the meeting. r
Our opinion of the matter referred a
to in the above, does not differ mate- ii
he rially from what tihe Telegraph says.
aIn the two distriets where the White t
Man's campaign had its origination, a
and that organization was- attended i,
with such happy reselts in 1874; I
that samething must be done to di- '
r- vide the white vote, is no new thing
d to us-we well understand it; that is e
d their only hope. They have more ti
than once expressed the opinio that P
le they could not carry Louisiana against
the combined white element; a fatal
admission itis true, in the faee ofa b
eo claimed negro mjority. That theyo
i will fail to aeeumplish the desired ob- a
ject, atleast In this section, they have,
no doubt, already learned; what new t
game they may elect to put Ino mo
Stion, remains to be developed by
time. At all events, flat roid Ait.t
