Your attention is called to the discrepancy
between the total found belonging to the
wvaterworks and electric light fund by this
report and that found by the report of the
treasurer, the latter being less by $24.23' ;
this is due to an error of the collector in
adding trom his tax stubs and in turning
over same to the treasurer. It can be rem
edied by simply passing a resolution ordering
the secretary to issue a warrant for the
amount out of the general fund to the credit
of the special fund. All the collections
were paid, but not properly classified as to
uamount. Respectfully,
