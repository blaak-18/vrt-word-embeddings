TOLD BY PAIN
* 4If you have pains you should look after them quickly. Pain shows
something is wrong. The sharper the pain the more danger there is in
delay. There are thousands of women today who are bearing awful
pain almost continually, rather than tell -a physician about the shooting
pains in their lower abdomen, about the agony of falling of the womb
and the distress of leucorrhoea. They let the months pass and their trouble
becomes hard!er to cure and more distressing. But modest women can
Securce exemption from the embarrassment of a private examination.
When pain tells you of danger you can cure yourself by the use of
WINE oCARDUI
You can be cured without distressing publicity-in the privacy of your
home. With these facts before you there is no reason for the delay
which is increasing your misery and wasting the days of your life. Why not stop the
pain today ?
Belen, Miss.. March 9. 1900.
I have used one bottle of Wine of Cardul and one package of Thedford's Black-Draught. Before I began to take your medicines I had
pains in my back, hips, lower be wels and my arms. Sometimes I thought I would go blind. My head ached and I was so weak I could hardly
walk across the floor. N w I can only feel a little of the pain in my side and I am going to use your medicines until I get cured, for I believe
they will certainly cure me. I have been married twelve years and am the mother of seven children. I thank you for your wonderful medicine
and what ithas dons for me. MATILDA SMITH.
