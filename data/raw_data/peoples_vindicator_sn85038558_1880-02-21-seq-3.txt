barely missed Mr. Simmons' I- e, he the
e fortunately pushing the muzzle of 11g

shot made a hole in the broom rack gr
and then lodged in a bundle of ao

re The spirit of improvement in our rc
Smidst i not confined solely to the ci
upper and central sections of our I
city. A tour of inspection in the li
Stower end of our city, reveals the fact
be that the tiseos cf that locality have b
Ity caught the infection. Our energetic a
bs. baker PRILIP ocl has emroted at
an neat little buildine at the foot of the a
re- dirt bridge on Jefferson street, and c
Ein has in successful operation a small
ir-l grocery and bread shop. He has I
o. also had an addition put to his main I
buildini. New and neat fences have I
been erected in front of several rea'
ty ideneos besides other improveme ts.
ell The increase of prosprity brings
of with It a ew spirit of enterpris,
ae among ol people. It is to be hoped
Pr- that it will be lasting, ad the long

Previous to the night of Thuresdy,
tthe 12th inst., very beavy Bouthern D
winds prevailed, and the sky was
overcast with dark storm clouds, but
no rain fell. At eleven o'clock tho
night the wind sucddenly veered to
the Northwest. Vivid fla shes of
SLightninl lit up the Egyptiao dark-nI
ness, followed by the tbunder's sano- n
gry roar. A perfect hurricane arose.,
Saccompanied with bail stones. But
a part of the storm visited this place,
I lasting but a few moments. Yet
fences were prostrated, and trees up
r rooted. In the upper portion of the o N
e city the winsd lifted the roof from
ar Mr. F. Hubley's shop, an old build- DrA
oe ino. No other serious damage was
at done here. The heavy Convent fence
we blew againist this local's residence o
tc with a crash, thorougbly alarming b1
athe inmates, while the building *fd

t. ood, cutting a clean sward half a
Smile wide, leaving not a tree stand- i

has were en route to this city on the
bri ga oft of the storm, and give gtrph l
aeolts of the perils l d hardships
they enoountered. They had to ocut
a b their way through the fallen timber,
isd and were fifteen hours in reaching t
ob this city from Mansfield. li
