Everything for Summer Wear for Ladies, Men and Boys can be found in our immense stock. All prices, all colors, all sizes. Everybody wondershow we manage to
Scrowded every day, when June is considered a dull month. Some say it is the electric fans which render our big store so comfortable that we are al rowded.
'Other s ma it is our plite, accommodatin clerks. Still others sa we hoo-doo the public. All are partially correct, and here is the rest of the secret: CHARM
;THEM WITH VARIETY, WE MESMEI~E THEM WITH SYLE, WE HYPNOTIZE THEM WITH QUALITY."
And while they are in this helpless con ition, we knock them clear off the Christmas Tree with prices. It sounds cruel, but they all like it and come again and again,

The Gazette believes that it is
untortunate for the cause of public
education in this parish that Mr.
R. C. Greig has not been retained
as a teacher. Mr. Greig is con
cededly one of the best school
teachers this parish has ever had
in its employ and no man has ever
worked harder to enhance the
cause of public education than he
has since his entrance into the
school room as a teacher some fif
teen years ago. The Lafayette
public school, of which he was
principal, has never failed to give
thorough satisfaction to pupils and
parents and we dare say that nine
teen out of every twenty patrons of
this school will deplore the failure
of the Board to secure the services
9f Mr. Greig for the next scholastic
year. Mr. Cunningham who has
been appointed to succeed Mr.
Greig, is a splendid gentleman and
a competent and experienced
' teacher, but despite the eminent
I fitness of his successor, The Gazette
thinks that Mr. Greig was the man
for the place and the interests of
the community demanded that he
be retained.
t Dr. F. S. Mudd has removed his
1 office to the room adjoining
r Clegg's drugstore.
Prof. Simmons who has been
teaching in the Scott public. school,
has accepted the position of
principal of the Jeanerette public
e school. Mr. Simmons was one of
n the best teachers in this parish and
the people of Scott are sorry to
lose hima. Mr. Simmons left
