hitting folly as it flies, ahd showing up
the political and social shams by its
masterly cartoons and pungent editorials,.
it achieved even greater success than
before, and was recognized as the ablest
and brightest of its class. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
"What is the cause of tfhe unpar
alleled success of VINE AR BIT
TERs " Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of VIx
soaR BITTars in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of Da. WAL
an's VINEOARLIrTTERS are Aperient, Dia
phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious, Laxa
tive, Diuuetic, Sedative, Counter-Irritant,
Sudorific, Alterative, and Anti-Bilious.

out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka

heat and drynea, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange.
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to DR. J. W\VAL.KER VINEGAR
BITrras, as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy faCn

For Female omplaints, in young

ic Bitters display so decided an influence
that improvement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Titiatel Blood
whenever oh find` its bnpurities bursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,

it when it is foul; your feelings will tell
.on when. Keep the blood pure, and the
health of the system will follow.

or gray hair
to its original
color, witA tShe gloss and freshness of
youth. Thin hair is thickened, fall
ing hair checked, and baldness ofien,
though not always, cured by its
use. Nothing can restore the hair
where the follicles are destroyed, or
the glands atrophied and decayed;
but such as remain can be saved by
this application, and stimulated into
activity, so that a new growth of
hair is produced. Instead of fouling
the 'air with a pasty .edinrait, it
wif seep it clean and vigorous. Its
occasional use will prevent the hair
from turning gray or filling off,
and consequently prevent baldness.
The restoration of vitality it gives
to the scalp arrests and prevents
the formation of dandruff, which is
often so uncleanly and otFensire.
Free from those deleterious sub
stances which make some prepara
tions dangerous, and injurious to the
hair, the Vigor can only benefit, but
npt harm it. If wanted merely for
a HAIR DRESSING, nothing else
can be found so desirable. Contain
ing neither oil nor dye, it does not
soil white cambric, and yet lasts
long on the hair, giving it a rich,
glossy lustre, and a grateful perfume.
