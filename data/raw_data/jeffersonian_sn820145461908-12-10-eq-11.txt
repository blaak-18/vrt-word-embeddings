FARM AND RANCH, Dalia*, Tgxaa.
And in this connection I am tempt
ed to relate a story, told by Senator
Henderson of Missouri, which not
only makes the point of the simplicity
of life in the old log school house, but
also depicts the stern discipline which
the master always exercised. Several
months before President Lincoln
issued the great Proclamation of
Emancipation which gave freedom to
the whole race of negro slaves in
America, my friend, Senator Hender
son of Missouri, came to the White
House one day and found Mr. Lin
coln in a mood of deepest depression.,
Finally the great President said to
his caller and friend that the most
constant and acute pressure was
being brought upon him by the
leaders of the radical element of his
party to free the slaves.
1 ‘ Sumner and Stevens and Wilson
simply haunt me,”, declared Mr.
Lincoln, ‘ ‘ with their importunities for
a proclamation of emancipation.
Wherever I go and whatever way I
turn they are on my trail. And still,
in my heart, I have the deep con
viction that the hour has not yet
come.”
Just as he said this, he walked to
the window looking out upon Penn
sylvania avenue and stood there in
silence, his tall figure silhouetted
against the light of the window pane,
every line of it and of his gracious
face expressive of unutterable sad
ness. Suddenly his lips began to
twitch into a smile and his somber
eyes lighted with a twinkle of some
thing like mirth.
“The only schooling I ever had,
Henderson,” he remarked, “was in
a log school house when reading books
and grammars were unknown. All
our reading was done from the
Scriptures and we stood up in a long
line and read in turn from the Bible.
Our lesson one day was the story of
the faithful Israelites who were
thrown into the fiery furnace and
delivered by the hand of the Lord
without so much as the smell of fire
upon their garments. It fell to one
little fellow to read the verse in
which occurred, for the first time in
the chapter, the names of Shadrach,
Meshach and Abed-ne-go. Little
Bud stumbled on Shadrach, floun
dered on Meshach and went all to
pieces on Abed-ne-go. Instantly the
hand of the master dealt him a cuff
on the side of the head and left him
wailing and blubbering as the next
boy in line took up the reading. But,
before the girl at the end of the line
had done reading he had subsided
into sniffles and finally became quiet.
His blunder and disgrace were for
gotten by the others of the class until
his turn was approaching to read
again. Then, like a thunder-clap out
of a clear sky, he set up a wail which
even alarmed the master, who, with
rather unusual gentleness inquired:
“What’s the matter now?”
“Pointing with <a shaking finger
at the verse which a few moments
later would fall to him to read, Bud
managed to quaver out the answer:
“ ‘Look there, marster —there
comes them same damn three fellers
again.’ ”
Then, his whole face lighted with
such a smile >as only Lincoln could
give, and he beckoned Senator Hen
derson to his side, silently pointing
his long bony finger to three men
Jeffersonian
who were at that moment crossing
Pennsylvania avenue toward the door
of the White House. They were
Sumner, Wilson and Thaddeus
Stevens.—Hon. Adlai E. Etevenson

AUSTRALIAN LABOR.
Org’anized labor in Australia has
overreached itself and has got a de
cided judicial setback. The labor un
ions, finding themselves holding the
balance of power in the common
wealth parliament, secured the pass
age of an act imposing upon the out
put of the manufacturers of harvest
ers and other agricultural implements
an internal revenue tax so heavy as
to deprive them of the benefits of pro
tection, but with a proviso for the
entire remission of this internal reve
nue tax in favor all concerns which
paid the union scale of wages, which
scale had been declared by resolution
of both houses to be fair and reason
able. The issue, however, was ear
ned to the highest court, which held
that the law’ was unconstitutional.
The principle of the decision was that
notwithstanding its professed intent,
the real purport of the law was not
to levy a tax or to raise revenue, but
to regulate wages and the internal
trade of the States. Therefore the
court declared it to be an unconstitu
tional infringement upon the rights
of the States. Had the law been sus
tained many manufacturers of the im
plements named would, it is stated,
have been compelled to suspend busi
ness.—Richmond News-Leader.
BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.
If you have a tender message
Or a loving word to say,
Do not wait till you forget it,
But whisper it today
The tender word unspoken,
The letter never sent,
The long forgotten messages,
The wealth of love unspent;
For these some hearts are breaking,
For these some loved ones wait; .
So show them that you care for them
Before it is too late,
—F. 11. Sweet,
