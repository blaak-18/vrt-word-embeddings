STONE AND BRYAN.
They Addressed the Mlai.sou Demoeratic
Pres. Assotation.
Kansas City, April 22.-Senator
Wiliam J. Stone, addressing the an
anal convention of the Missouri Dem
ocratic Press association, made an
elaborate explanation of his connec
tion with baking powder legislation
and the enforcement of the state pure
food laws, and bitterly denounced the
daily newspapers of Missouri, which,
he declared, had "hounded" him out
rageously.
William J. Bryan was received en
thusiastically. He declared that
throughout the country he had found
deep and growing dissatisfaction
among the Republican voters. Prais
ing the state of Missouri for its pres
ecution of the packing houses, he
said:
"The' Federal government seems to
be afraid to enforce the criminal law,
and prefers the lse of injunctions."
Mr. Bryan spoke of the hostility of
most of the large daily papers to the
Democratic party, and said that some
of the professed Democratic papers of
the east "have done more harm in
for years of apologizing for the
Democratic platform than they can
undo in four months of a campaign
by supporting the ticket."
Senator Stone declared that he had
no part in the passage of the anti
alum law of 1899.
"I swear to you I never spoike or
wrote to any member of either house
of the legislature concerning this
matter, and I hope-every guilty man
will be uncovered."
In closing, Senator Stone said:
"1 nope God will wither my hand,
palsy my tongue and burn my heart
in the flames of hell before I shall in
tentionally dishonor any person to
which the people of Missouri assign
me."
Wilmington, N. C., April 22.-Twelvw

New York, April 22.-Justice Geiger
Ich, in the supreme court, signed an

which ennoble man and draw him to his

lanthe Lodge Knights of Pythias, which c
paid him their last tribute of respect.

WANTED-A LITTLE GIRL.
Where have they gone to. the little girls
\Vith natural manners and natural curls.
\Vho love their dollies and like their toys.
And talk of something besides the boys?
Little old women in plenty I find.
Mature in manners, and old in mind:
Little old flirts who talk of their beaux,
And vie with each other in stylish
clothes.
Little old belles, who, at nine and ten,
Are sick of pleasure and tired of men,
WVeary of travels, of balls, of fun,
And find no new thing under the sun.
Once, in the beautiful long ago,
Some dear little children I used to know,
Girls who were merry as lambs at play,
And laughed and rollicked the livelong
day.
They thought not at all of the style of
their clothes,
They never imagined that boys were
beaux
Other girls' brothers and mates were
they:
Splendid fellows to help them play.
Where have they gone to? If you see
One of them anywhere, send her to me.
I would give a medal of purest gold
To one of those dear little "iris of old,
With an innocent heart and an open
smile.
Who knows not the meaning of flirt or
style.

the Philadelphia and Reading, the
Lehigh Valley, Central and New Jer
sey, New York, Susquehanna and Wes
tern, Erie, Ontario and Western, Dela
ware and Hudson, Pennsylvania and
Baltimore and Ohio.
The specific complaints of Mr
Hears are the roads charge unreasor..
ble rates, that they unjustly discrine
inate in favor of bituminous and
against anthricite coal companies, and
they contrived in violation of the ant i
pooling section of the interstate com
merce commission law to discriminate
against independent coal mining com
pauies and in favor of companies con
trolled by the railroads.
The commission is also to consider
while here the old case of complaint
of the Texas Cattle Raisers' associa
tion and Chicago Live Stock associa
tion against the Chicago local trans
fer tax, which calls for a payment of
$2 per car for cattle transferred from
terminal western railroads in Chicago

on that subject the commission order
ed a reduction frqo $2 to $1 per car.
That ruling was submitted to the
United States supreme court, which
sent the whole case back to the in
terstate commission for more evi.
dence. None of the railroads were
represented when the commission con
vened.

time he spoke so strongly because he
felt strongly.
