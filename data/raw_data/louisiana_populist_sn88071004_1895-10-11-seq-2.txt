In the days of Midas whatever
the man touched turned into gold ;
things are different now-touch a
man with gold and hq turns into t
anything.-Ex. t
In 1892 the Leaders of the pres
tnt administration faction said,
"the elimation of the farmers from
the democratic party would make
it look like a sucked orange."
These same leaders have succeeded
Iretty well in "elminating the
farmers" from their wing of the F
Democratic party, and we take
their word for it as to the condi
tion-pulp and rine is about all
there is left of it.--Capital Item.
Let our party throw down the 1~
gauntlet to the Democrats by in
viting them into a white primary,
the defeated ticket to be withdrawn.
Just a soon as the Democratic F
ticket is nominated we mast make
them accept or shoulder all the
blame for fraudulent elections;
place upon them the negro vote
wheathey refuse, which they no F
doubt will, to agree to a white
man's choioe of govermnent.

the seratlmert of every honest F
man ia the arntry :

To stsa a vote cast by a negro
i as much a theft uas to run your

T. THE RESULT.
Our primary election held in this
TIE
parish last Saturday was a success
in every way, and the People's par
0 ty of the parish is proud of the
Iresult.
The vote is a large one. Not
o'1 withstanding a sharp detection in
or. wards 5 and 7, on account of oppo
er. sition to primaries in general, our
~ party succeeded in polling about
), 2-thirds of its white votes in the
' ari.h, and over one halt of the
total registered white vote of the
parish.
The result shows that our party
is enthusiastic, conservative and
determined, and that it has made a
* healthy and vigorous growth du
00 ring the past year.
The ticket named is a strong one,
iand one of which every Populist
will be proud. It will command
t the fall strength of the party, aind
will catch here and there many
be a stray vote from both the other
parties. It is a thoroughly repre
e: sentative ticket, and will strength
ni en our party at home and in other
parishes.
The candidates defeatedt in the
primary were quite as good men.
and made excellent runs, each one
carrying his home ward, save where
two lived in the same, and but for
the fact that all could not win,
none would have been defeated.
It would be impeaching their in
tegrity and doubting their true
manhood to insinuate that any one
of them will fail to give his loyal
support to the ticket, and we have
already heard free and full assu
rances to that effect from each one
of them.
We have hoisted this ticket at
our masthead, and for it we are go
ing to work will a will that will not
Swaver until victory is ours.
r Let Populists close up the ranks
and rally around their banner, and
to they are sure to push their ticket
to victory.
