HOW PRIESTS ENTRAP RICH
GIRLS.
When a Mr. Caldwell died in Ken
tucky some years ago, he left a large
fortune to his two daughters, and
also made Archbishop Spalding their
guardian. The result was that this
priest so worked upon the religious
sensibilities of the elder girl, that
she gave $300,000 to found the ill
fated “Catholic University” in Wash
ington. Since then this woman (the
Marquise de Monstiore) and her sis
ter (the Baroness von Zedwitz) have
become protestants.
But Spalding is still up to his old
tricks. We now read in the daily
press:
“Cincinnati, August 2. —The three
daughters of Milton Young, a noted
Kentucky turfman, and worth, it is
said, several millions of dollars in
realty and mining property in his
State, have left their homes in Lex
ington to become nuns. They are
now in the Sacred Heart Convent at
Albany, N. Y.
“They left their homes to take
their veils voluntarily.
“The first one to go was Miss
Marie Young, who entered that con
vent two years ago. She wrote her
sisters and advised them to come.
Though they had all the money they
could wish for, and though there
were many suitors for the hand of
each one, the two girls have gone to
the cloistered life and will remain
there, say their parents. It so hap
pens that Mrs. Young, the mother, is
a relative of Archbishop Spalding,
and he obtained the place for the
girls, one of whom, Miss Spalding
Young, is named for him. The other
is Miss Alice Young.
“Their father has made a name
for himself as the owner of fine
horses. He says that if the girls
think they ought to be nuns, he is
so much the happier. They will re
ceive at his death all his estate, pro
vided their mother is not living, and
after her death it will all go to them.
They will naturally give it to the
church.”
These last few words show the
cunning of popery: “They will
naturally give it to the church”! And
the father and mother, probably very
ignorant and superstitious people,
are the blind victims of the most
devlish system on earth.
There are some peculiar state
ments in the telegram. Note the
words: “They take their veils volun
tarily.’ A virtual admission that
some of Rome’s victims do not enter
the convents “voluntarily.” Note
again: Their sister “advised them to
come.” Their sister is allowed to
write only under the supervision of,
or at the dictation of, the “mother
superior.” Again: “Archbishop
Spalding obtained the places for the
girls.” As if these heiresses to mil
lions were being put out to domestic
service!

MILEAGE GRAFT.
The early statesmen of the repub
lic, before the days of railroads, fixed
the mileage of Senators and Con
gressmen at 20 cents per mile. This
was at a time when the trip to Wash
ington and return had to be made by
stage coach. The allowance was rea
sonable and just.
Today Senators and Congressmen
ride over the railroads to and from
Washington at two cents per mile.
Until quite recently most of them
rode on passes. But they all con
tinue to draw 20 cents per mile go
ing to and coming from the Capital
City.
It is a deliberate swindle, a brazen
robbery, a shameless graft.
And yet if there is a Senator or a
Congressman who has refused to be
a party to this theft we have not
heard of him.
The law has never been changed,
as honest men would have done, to
meet modern conditions. A Senator
or Congressman whose salary is
$7,500 a year is allowed SIOO or
more for mileage without having
traveled a mile. If this is not steal
ing, what is it?
The fact is that Senators and Con
gressmen ought to pay their fare the
same as other people, and if they had
any self-respect they would do it. A
hod-carrier in search of a job has to
pay railroad fare for every mile he
travels, or walk the ties. A washer
woman with a family, compelled to
visit a dying relative has to pay fare,
but Senators and Congressmen, who
fix their salaries at more than S6OO
per month and allow themselves lib
eral perquisites for expenses can not
afford to pay their fare.
All of this graft and moral turpi
tude is characteristic of capitalist
statesmanship. Public office is pri
vate graft, and that is all there is to
it. All pretense to honesty is sham
and duplicity to deceive the people.
Congressman Cox says that in op
posing this graft he “runs the risk
of incurring the displeasure of every
member of Congress.” We agree
with him. They are all grafters and
will fight any attempt to deprive
them of their spoils.
The mileage graft ought to be
thoroughly ventilated by the whole
press not subsidized by the ruling
class. It is a public scandal and an
unmitigated disgrace. Farmers’

The worst record made by a Demo
cratic Senator in the late session was
that of Senator McEnery, of Louisi

When the time comes to a ' ,e or

the Aldrich brand of Republicanism.

A VERY PROPER PROCEEDING.
If the advocates of special privi
leges for a few Atlanta jobbers are
going to keep up the fight in Georgia
for that selfish propaganda, it was a
truly typical and fitting thing for the
campaign to be started by some few
Atlanta drummers at the home of ex-
Governor Smith in Atlanta, as was
reported by the city edition of the
Atlanta Journal last Sunday, the
meeting having been held the night
before.
It was also the regular and appro
priate thing to begin by glorifying
over the fall of the pale occupant of
the roller-chair, and to pronounce
against Obe Stevens, and for the re
election of the Atlanta man on the
Commission.
The whole pith, point and poignant
purpose of this scheme is so manifest
that it is a matter of amazement that
all the people do not see it plainly
and understand it perfectly.
Any man who will stop to look at
the record —the history of this
scheme —must see that no question
of port rates, so-called, for Georgia
was ever before put before the Com
mission, but that a petition for spe
cial rates for Atlanta jobbers went
before it four separate and distinct
times; that the last time was the
Beck & Gregg case, for whose ad
verse vote on it McLendon was sus
pended; and the time before the last
was the case in which Joe Brown an
nounced that he was Commissioner
for Georgia, and not for Atlanta, and
for which he was fired by the man
who appeared first before the Com
mission as the paid attorney for the
Atlanta interests. The man who
<
does not understand this thoroughly
is the man who has not kept himself
posted as the history was being writ
ten.
But they are banking again, it
seems, and taking the chance on fool
ing the people, so many of whom do
not stop to investigate.
Os course Brown was a man to put
out of the way. They did it for a sea
son. And of course Obe Stevens is
another man to put out of the way—
and Warner Hill, but his term does
not expire next year. To be sure, it
is the thing for them to do to re-
elect Atlanta man who is for the
special privileges, and also
man of similar feeling and
.erests as a successor to the
. who may be put in McLendon’s
r uace.
And above all, as we have said, it
was the proper caper for a few At
lanta drummers to get together and
start the ball, and to pledge their
support in advance to “any plan”
that the attorney for the Atlanta
Freight Bureau may suggest, which
they did.
But we hope the people of Georgia
will not be led into the trap.—Macon
Telegraph.
AS TO DEMOCRATIC SUCCESS.
Highly important as is Demo
cratic success, it may not be amiss
to remark, just among ourselves,
that it is a matter of regret that the
Democrats in Congress have not
come out of the tariff fight itself
with a large measure of credit.
They may win as a result of dis
content with the Republican party,
and certainly no party more richly
deserves defeat, but to the unpreju
diced observer, the conclusion is in
evitable that the Democrats in Con
gress failed to realize their oppor
tunity and, by striving for a share
in the spoliation system of the Re
publican party, lost a more than or
dinary chance to demonstrate to the
country that were they entrusted
with like power they would adminis
ter it not for selfish reasons, nor for
local gain, but for the benefit of the
entire country.
Bailey of Texas voting for a duty
on iron ore, McEnery of Louisiana
and two members of his delegation
in the house voting with the Repub
licans on every division. Tillman
seeking to impose a duty on tea, and
other prominent Democrats contend
ing for the highest possible measure
of protection for the productions of
f’eir respective committees, do not
afford the singleness and breath of
purpose which would direct the
course of a Democratic majority,
while the flat and unblushing repu
diation of the pledges of the Demo
cratic national platform, notably in
the case of free lumber, detract just
so much more from the confidence
with which a public grown sick of
Republican grab methods might turn
to the Democracy for relief.
Comment on this unfortunate
phase of the tariff situation may be
misunderstood, but the acts of Dem
ocratic members of both houses were
performed in the full light of pub
licity, and if the lesson is pointed
here, if the fact that they have
missed a brilliant opportunity is em
phasized in these columns may it not
accomplish more good within the
party than an effort to ignore the
facts, an effort at concealment about
as practicable as that of the ostrich
when he seeks to elude his enemies
'"'v hiding only his head. —Marietta
