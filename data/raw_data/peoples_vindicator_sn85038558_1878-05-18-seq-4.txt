OUR WASHINGTON LET'ER.
WASHINGTON D. C., May, 10, 1$'8.
Whatever the general wish may
have been among members of the
Democratic party a month ago, there
is now unquestionably a desire for an
investigation into the affairs conected
with the late Presidential election in
Florida and Louisianta. Two things
stand in the way. First, the convic
tion of a large number of Democrats,
in the South, that any interferenee
with the existing state of things
would be unfair after once having
agreed to the settlement by an Elec
toral Commission ; and, second, a dis
like of Mr. Tilden, which it has been
the constant effort of a few Democrats
to increase.
The first objection is not sound in
morals or reason. By the terms of
the Electoral Commission bill any
settlement made by the Commisasion
was to be subjected to inquiry in the
Courts. If there is any bad faith at
all it is denying, to the defeated can
didate the specific means of relief
which were in general terms prom
ised. If upon due inquiry by the
proper Courts it is found that Mr.
Hayes is not properly President, there
is no hardship in compelling him to
drop the office. On the contrary the
hardship is in keeping it from the
rightfull party.
The other ground on which inves
tigation and reference to the Courts
are opposed by some, is that they
prefer Hayes, who is in, to Tilden,
who is out. It is worthy of note that
this, like the other objection, admits
the probability-almost the certainty
-of a change if the case goes before
even a radical body like the Supreme
Court. If there were not a fatal weak
ness in the title of Mr. Hayes, inves
tigation would not taki anything
from him which is his, and therefore
would do him no honor, nor would it
elevate to office Mr. Tilden, who, for
the sake of the argument, we may
admit to be a base man. But the
character of the individual does not
not affect his rights of property-at
least until after judicial proceedings,
and those are what the friends of Mr
Tilden desire. There does not seem,
however, to be that moral or intel
lectual superiority over Mr. T. on the
part of Mr. Hayes which would ex
cuse even a sentimental preference
for the latter. Mr. Tilden is a very
able and honorable man, of good ex
perience in public life, and in the
campaign of 1876 and in later events
acted a dignified and patriotic part.
Of Mr. Hayes it is not too much to
say that his withdrawal of troops
from the South appears to have been
forced upon him, if it was not the re
sult of a "bargain" and that his "civil
service reform" is a delusion even if
he intend to carry it out honestly.
On these two' points, more than any
others, he and his friends have chal
lenged the admiration and support of
the people.
On Wednesday evening Mr. Lock
wood, of New York, made a thought
ful speech in advocacy of Mr. Kim
mell's bill providing means by which
the Supreme Court may take action
on the subject, and debate may be
said to be fairly begun.
SpeakerjRandall's appearance on the
floor of the House, the other day, and
the wholesome truths he uttered as
to the extravagant course pursued by
the Republican Representatives in re
gard to the public funds, made a great
sensation at the time and continues
to attract attention.
ALBION.
A MEAGRE BILL OFFARE.
The Hard Lines of the People of Vicks
burg During the Siege. -
[Edward S. Gregory in the Philadelphia
Weekly Times ]
How these people subsisted was anoth
er wonder. The straits to which the gar
rison were reduced are known in fact.
"After the tenth day of the siege," says
the report of Gen. Stephen D. Lee, the
men lived on about half rations, and less
than that toward the close. The ration
has been described to consist of one-quar
tsr pound of bacon, one-half pound of
beef, five-eights quart of meal, besides an
allowance of peas, rice, sugar and molpe
seos. Of this, anon. The citiu.ens mut
have had less; and where they got that
from was a mystery. Business, of course,
was suspended. There were some stores
that had supplie, and at these prices
elimbed steadily in a manner suggestive
of the prophecy of Jerusalem's undoing.
A barrel of flour at last came to sell for
$100-an immense figure then; but worse
than the figure were the two facts-that
nobody had the money, and then nobody
had the flour. Some people eked out
their supdlies by cooking the tender
sprouts of the common cane of which
there was an immense "brake'" just be
low Vicksburg. I have reason to believe
that few a lokcations, and those only the
poorest people, were made to the milita.
ry powers for help throughout all this
trial. Sympathy and patriotism must
have improvised a practical communism.
The cruise and barrel had a little dust
and unction to the last.
How about the mule meat f everybody
will inquire while rations are being trea
ted. Both horse kid mule meat were ex
tensively sampled during the siege,
thougbhnot in the way that by many may
be imagined. On account of the want of
provender nearly all the horses in the
garrison were turned out of the lines,
and as the other side could not safely
take them unless they strayed within
reach, many of them were killed by the
cross-tire. Early in the lsiege, when some
of the men complained of the seanty ra
tion, Gen. Smith, I believe, who had seen
the thing done on the plains, issued eir'
eulars to his brigades, recommending that
the experiment of horse meat to be tried
te pieoe it out. I was on hand that very
evening when somebody, waiting till
dark. elid over the works and cut a steak
out of a horse that had been shot that day
beneath them. It was cooked at Qeperal
Vaughn's fire and everybody tasted a lit.
tie; but the flesh was coarse and nobod
.hangered for any more. Some of the
diers did like it and eat it; not to siek
of rats and other small deer ilchthe
Louisianians, being Frenchmen, were
said to prepare in elegant styles for the
table. When Pemberton was thinking
about cautting bie way out he had half a
dozen fellows, men who looked like Mex
icans or Indians, cutting mule meat at tle
old depot of the Southern Railroad and
jerking it over slow ires to make it ban
dy andlasting. One morning, for trial,
I bought a pound of mule meat at this
market, and had it served at breakfast
for the mess. There was no need to try
again. On the day of the surrender, and
o then, a ration of mule meat was ge
unay iaed; but nobody need eat it, at
Gen, Grant isned abundant supplies of
the best that his army had.

I AMONG the FARlMER S.
Value of Forest Leaves.
The effect of removing the litter of
e a mature forest is really far greater
e than would result from the mere re
d moval of many pounds of nitrogen,
phosphoric acid, and potash. When
the litter is allawed to accumulate
from year to year, and to undergo its
natural slow decomposition, the re
' sult is the formation of a forest soil
' exceedingly rich in humus; the for
mation of such a soil is often of price
' less value to the forester. A rough,
sterile, rocky soil becomes, when
penetrated with humus, capaple of
retaining water, and thus able to
i withstand drought. By this action of
humus the mineral plant food which
the soil contains is also brought into
a more soluble and available form;
while the greatly increased porosity
of the soil protects all soluble plant
e food from being washed out by heavy
rains, a calamity to which the origi
nal rocky soil was continualy liable.
So great is the importance of humus,
- that in many forest soils its presence
6 is the one ameliorating principle which
r" renders cultivation possible. Espe
e cially must this be the case on the
e hillsides so frequently devoted to the
e growth of timber. Nor in this case
e are the advantages of the deep humus
soil confined to the tree growing up
on it. Owing to the enormous power
of retaining water passed by a spon
gy vegetable soil, the adjacent valleys
are effectually protected against dis
astrous floods. Storm water is re
tained or delayed, is stored up in the
e forest soil for use in summer drought,
e instead of descending in violent
streams, tearing up the soil and
spreading havoc all around. The
careful maintainance of forests upon
g hillsides becomes in this view a ques.
tion which is in many cases of nation
al importance.
To produce in its fullest extent the
e humus covering of the soil, it is nec
,t essary that the forests should be
it planted sufficiently close, in open
spaces admitting light and air the hIu
r mus will rapidly oxidize and disap
, pear. For the same reason care
should be taken that planting imme
e diately follows the felling of timber;
the ground, as far as possible, should
e never be suffered to lie open and un
covered.
