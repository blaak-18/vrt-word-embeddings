Lafayette excells in many things,
but we did not know that she had a
citizen who is entitled to the cham

best tomato-eater on record. He

matoes and ate them in less than
ten minutes; he used no bread to
perform this feat, but instead took
eight ounces of sugar. Can any
one beat this ?

A carnival celebration compara
tively equal to that of the Crescent
City will be held at New Iberia Feb.

progressiveness and energy, have
* gone nmto this movement and their
efforts have crystalized verily into a
success. The pageant will be on a
very elaborate scale. Two distinct
- associations are to participate and
from their respective themes, the
public can be assured of a most
asthetic and artistic display. The
ball will be a memorable event. A
lavish expenditure towards it has
been made and no stone has been
left unturned that would make it a
brilliant affair. Arrangements have
been made with the railroads where
by a reduction will be given visitors
. along the line, and reasonable rates
-for board are promised. A hearty
invitratton is extended to all to join
in the revelries of the day and a

lMorest :litand Gore.
Signor'na Nice Moreska, the won
derful Italian soprano, and Signor Ps
Alfredo Gore, the great pianist, will s
appear ti-night at Falk's Opera
house under the direction of the by
i Dunning Medine Music Co., of Dr
New Orleans. These famous mu- po
i sicians are highly praised by the
press everywhere. We give below thi
a few of the compliments paid them lo1
L by the papers published in the wt
e town and cities visited by them. sui
The Clarion-Ledger, the leading a
daily of Mississippi, published at tel
Jackson, says: - mi
The Moreska-Gore concert of
last night was one of the grandest fit;
musical events that was ever wit- syv
nessed in Jackson. It was a success an
r in every particular, and those that the
were fortunate enough to attend mi
shall never forget the sweet strains un
that emanated from Moreska, one sel
of the grandest dramatic sopranos kn
t that lives this day. One of her of
llnumber, "Denolero," was sung with pu
such a dash that the audience went be
wild over her, and it simply meant m4
that beautiful Moreska will be heard hij
• again. Each of her numbers was bli
encored vigorously, and everybody en
was sorry when she sang her last di'
enotes, for they knew that it would pu
be a long time before they could of
again enjoy such a treat. wi
r Gore certainly proved himself to
a be a master of the piano, and as a
Sgentleman was heard to say, "if
there is any living man who can tc
outdo him in his line of business I
would most certainly have to see
* him before I would believe." His a
variations in the Carnival of Venice nr
are beautiful and truly delightful.
All music-loving people should go tu
to hear them whenever they have an
opportunity, and The Clarion-Led
ger assures them a delightful ha
evening.
The Baton Rouge Advocate
closes a very complimentary article he
e with the following paragraph:
In conclusion we would like to t
say this: Baton Rouge has had the te
a grandest musical from Moreska and qt
Gore that it ever had, and they can bi
d rest assures if they ever come back at
I both will be accorded a grand re- de
I ception.
The Louisville Courier-Journal a
speaks in the following eulogistic ni
terms of these sweet singers from D
sunny Italy:
,e Signorina Moreska could not es- s
cape without an encore of each rendi
a tion. She reached in the finale of 01
al the ",Inflammatus," a dramatic vo- L
s cal climax, that fairly took her :
hearers off their feet. Gore pleased tc
the audience as only an artist can. ol
'n The piano under the strengh of his
1. wrists, rolls like thunder and tosses Cl
d like a forest shaken by the whistling o0
wind. At the same time his touch p
is gentle, caressing, lover-like.
