MAKING CITIZENS
OR CRIMINALS?
—K-K-K
Is It Better to Spend Money for
Schools or for Courts and
Prisons?
—K-K-K
“Those who think the schools cost
too much tend to forget that the cost
of everything else we have has in
creased proportionately. What we
eat, what we wear, fuel, light, farm
lands, rent, transportation, furniture,
machinery—all have obeyed the same
law. The teacher who gets an an
nual salary of $1,200 today can buy
little, if any, more with it than she
could buy with half that amount ten
years ago. The cost of school build
ings, school equipment, fuel, jani
tors’ services, and everything else
that must be provided for in a school
budget, is subject to the same gen
eral economic trend,” says J. O. En
gleman, field secretary of the N. E. A.
Cost Is Less
“But what of the charge that the
state cannot afford the cost of edu
cating its children? The answer is,
that education at almost any price is
actually cheaper and less expensive
than ignorance, immorality and
crime. Our government is predicated
upon the assumption that knowledge
and virture shall be generally dif
fused among the people. Under no
other conditions is our form of gov
ernment workable. Our political
forefathers recognized this truth, and
it inspired them to declare that re
ligion, morality and knowledge are
essential to good government and to
the happiness of mankind. Increased
education results in increased values
of property in any community. In
deed, property, and life itself, is
made safe and secure only as schools
abound and do the work for which
they are established. One need go
no further than Mexico or Russia
today to see the correlation that ex
ists between ignorance and insecurity
of both property and life.
Life More Complicated
“There was a time when many
of the most valuable elements in a
child’s education and life were ob
tained while he was going to the lit
tle red school, but not obtained in it.
These elements were developed by
the life he lived on the farm, and
included industry, initiative, self-re
liance, thrift, simple pleasures, and
other virtues for which the school
was little responsible.
“Today, life is less simple. The
home contributes less. More is de
manded of the schools. These are
the days when the state expects all
its children to remain in school, and
when it is under obligation, there
fore, to carry its program of instruc
tion to the differing tastes and ca
pacities of children. Once the pupils
merely quit if they tired of the ‘three
R’s’ or failed to succeed in them.
Now they dare not quit. The state
expects them to continue through the
compulsory education period. Hence
the demand for a varied curriculum,
for special rooms, and features that
may minister to the child who is
over-age, over-size, under-nourished,
crippled, deaf, blind, precocious, or
otherwise entitled to schooling suited
to his needs.”
J. C. WALTON’S PRAYER
(Contributed.)
Thou knowest, O Lord, that I’ve
been true
To my Catholic friends, and the
orthodox Jew,
And that bunch of papes that
Aldrich took
And talked his way to their
pocket-book—
For a dollar here, and ten-spot
there
Kept their whip on the rump of
the old gray mare.
But right now, O Lord, I need a
plan
To save my own from the
Ku Klux Klan.
I have yelled and cussed till a man
would think
That the dad-blamed Klan would
bust and sink.
I have turned out guys from the
old stone ‘pen’—
Such as Raper—O Lord—and
hold-up men.
I have given them gats, and my
card, you know,
Signed—J. C. Walton, Bull and
Blow.
I sent out Baird—he’s a darn good
man—
But I ain’t made a dent on the
Ku Klux Klan.
I thought that I had them once
or twice,
But they reared right back; that
wasn’t nice,
A fellow might just as well be
dead, ,
When he can’t back down nor go
ahead.
I have used up all my bag of
tricks,
And got myself in a h—l of a
fix.
So, Lord, can’t yon think of a
hole-proof plan
That will save my back from the
Ku Klux Klan?

Complete Amalgamation of Five
Anti Klan Societies Affected. Wal

the Conference
—K-K-K
Durant, Okla. An amalgamated
society for the suppression of the
Ku Klux Klan was affected here last
night in a session of Waltonites and
Farm Labor leaders which lasted
from 11 o’clock noon Friday until 4
o’clock in the morning Saturday.
Five separate and distinct organi
zations, each of which is certain of
an early Klan destruction are now
merged into one with headquarters at
423 North Broadway, Oklahoma City.
A complement of state officers, ex
ecutive committee, ’n everything has
been arranged. / -
The meeting was called to ordgr
Friday morning by Judge Porter of
Durant in the district court room.
The doors were locked with guards'
on the outside. The first order of
business after the selection of tem
porary chairman was the appoint
ment of a committee on credentials.
With such birds as R. R. Stevens of
Muskogee, J. C. Walton of Oklahoma
City, and others of like repute pres
ents, it was deemed wise to take
every possible precaution against the
presence of spies and lookouts.
A large crowd of spectators as
sembled hoping to hear at least a
chirp from the deposed governor but
instead, the common rabble was put
off with a speech in the Court House
yard by a Texas representative of the
Farmer-Labor movement.
The former governor was not re
ceived with the same enthusiasm that
greeted him at Shawnee although he
was quite as willing to accept the
Duran* platform without knowing
anything it contained. Called on for
a speech he made a few feeble re
marks, scathingly reproaching the Ku
Klux Klan, none of whom were sup
posed to be present.
Officers for the ensuing year or
so much thereof as the organization
may live, were elected as follows:
President, Porter Newman of Durant;
Vice President, Ben Ellisor of Atoka;
Secretary-Treasurer, E. C. Wallace of
Wapanucka. The following trustees
were elected: A. R. Town, Joe Stone,
A. R. Lewis, R. G. Arnold, G. W. Eng
lish, Earl Joyce, R. R. Stevens, C. G.
Ward and A. N. T Renegar
Attempt of the Walton forces to
capture and control the convention
was without success. The governor
stands repudiated by his own follow
ers so f?r as control is concerned.

Open Defiance of President
—K-K-K
Greencastle, Ind.—Students at De
Pauw university, Methodist school,
are exhibiting a growing feeling of
resentment at the continued attacks
made on the Ku Klux Klan by Presi
dent and by speakers whom he
is importing to malign the Klan.
The president’s bitter denouncement,
however, is increasing the growth of
the Klan in the school and is inject
ing the issue into school life.
It is believed here that if the
tirades against the Klan organization
are not discontinued an “open revolt”
will break out, and that those stu
dents belonging to the Klan will de
mand their rights as American citi
zens.
A number of girl students have
joined the Women of the Ku Klux
Klan and a movement is on foot
among them to come out openly in
defiance of the president. It is point
ed out by students that undergrad
uates at Wabash college are permit
ted the liberty of joining those or
ganizations which they deem fit. At
that school the student members of
the Klan have a “Klan band,” and
no attempt is made to hide the iden
tity of the members.
At Harvard university, not only a
very large percentage of the students
are members of the Klan, but a ma
jority of the faculty, it is understood,
are members.

MAYOR. OF BOSTON
GIVES PATRIOTS
TASTE OF HYPHENISM
—K-K-K
Denounces Loyal 'Coalition at Irish
Indignation Meeting in Behalf
of Conspiring Traitors
—K-K-K
Boston. —Boston had a real taste
of hyphenated patriotism last week,
when Mayor Curley took advantage
of an opportunity to shout, “Long
live the Pope,” and launched into a
characteristic Irish denunciation of
the Loyal Coalition, and all other
things strictly American that deny
his Irish relations the privilege of
joining because of their divided al
legiance.
The denunciation came as an an
swer to the Loyal Coalition’s protest
against the holding of a mass meet
ing Sunday night in Symphony hall,
where the Irish Catholics met to de
nounce treatment of the 15,000 Irish
Republicans jailed by the Free State
for treasonable acts against the Irish
government.
This hyphenated mayor of Boston,
in his reply to the patriotic members
of the Loyal Coalition, denounced the
Coalition, the Ku Klux Klan, and
“other kindred organizations,” and
also launched into a Roman tirade
against Lloyd George, former pre
mier of Great Britain, who was bom
barded with eggs of unsavory flavor
on his recent official visit to the Unit
ed States by Irish Catholics of New
York city.
Mr. Lloyd George was attacked be
caused he was the war-time premier
of Great Britain, a Protestant coun
try, that executed an Irish traitor,
Sir Roger Casement, because he con
spired with Germany to throw the
Irish support to the kaiser against
their own country.
It is getting pretty low when a
distinguished foreign visitor pays a
visit to the United States that a
bunch of Catholic hoodlums are per
mitted to run wild and insult him
simply because he represents a Pro
testant country that is jailing its
colonial traitors instead of sending
them to the gallows, where all trait
ors should go.
Hyphenated Patriotism
This sample of hyphenated patriot
ism, as exhibited by Mayor Curley
and the “Micks” of New York city,
is the greatest proof of the Catholic
idea of citizenship that has been of
fered recently. If Protestants would
conspire against the government of
Catholic France and were thrown in
prison cells, would Irish Catholic
“citizens” of Mayor Curley’s type
protest their treatment as they do
the treatment of the Irish traitors. A
traitor is a traitor, whether he is a
Catholic or a Protestent, a Gentile or
a Jew.
When Irish Caholics were ousted
from power in New York city just be
fore the Civil War by the American
party, it was these same “citizens” of
the church and state breed that pa
raded the streets of the metropolis
with banners saying that they would
“refuse to be ruled by Americans.” '

CHICAGO SCHOOLS
OAR PATRIOTIC AIRS
Do you know that a music commit
tee of the city of Chicago school
board ruled that the song “America”
shall not appear in the song books
used in the city’s public schools? It
is almost superflous to add that this
action met with the approval of the
affiliated “Irish” societies of Chica
go.
It is commonly understood and
generally believed that the public
schools of Chicago are under the con
trol and dictation of Roman Catho
lics, and that a high percentage of
the city’s public school teachers are
from the ranks of that organization.
What else could be expected from
that kind of a combination? And yet
there are those who still believe that
there is no need for an organization
like the Ku Klux Klan, which makes
it a business to look into and clean
up such un-American conditions.
'Bartering Our Forests
FOR SALE OR EXCHANGE—I,BOO,OOO acres of Minnesota forests.
Will trade for political patronage. Address J. A. O. Preus or the Republican
State Machine. ,
The above is, in effect, the meaning of the new fight to oust W. T.
Cox, state forester.
Mr. Cox has stood for service and efficiency in the state forestry de
partment. He has fought bitterly to keep the Republican administration
from making a football out of it.
Repeated efforts have been made to have the legislature take the direc
tion of the forestry service from the hands of Mr. Cox and invest it in the
politically manipulated timber department under the state auditor. The pur
pose was always so apparent, however, that the move invariably failed.
The removal of Mr. Cox- is planned merely to make room fdr a politician
who will use the forestry organization as a unit of the Preus political army.
Public sentiment has always stopped the schemers before. It must stop
it again. Otherwise our forest lands will be squandered and expert vote
getters will succeed expert foresters and rangers.
If you are a believer in forest conservation —if you are a supporter of
honest forest administration—if you are opposed to political jobbery, write
to Gov. Preus or the forestry board.
Make a vigorous protest against the removal of Mr. Cox.
The forest belongs to you. And the won’t dare disobey
your orders, if you make them sufficiently emphatic.

—K-K-K
Washington, •D. C. —Senator May
field of Texas, who has been in the
national capital for several weeks, is
prepared and waiting to meet any
issues which his opponent, G. C. Ped
dy, may raise, according to Mayfield’s
friends. These undoubtedly will be
referred to the Senate committee on
privileges and elections, it is said.
Although Peddy and hjs friends
filed a formal notice of protest with
the Senate sometime ago, this fact
did not deter Senator Mayfield from
taking the oath of office today when
he presented himself at the Senate
rostrum for that purpose. Senate
leaders declare that will be no pro
test from any side of the chamber to
bar the Texas senator from taking
his seat in the Senate, as there is no
question about his credentials.
“If there is any question later on
about Senator Mayfield’s eligibility to
his seat ard the matter is pursued,
the case probably will be referred to
the Senate committee on privileges
and elections to determine after a
hearing is held and all evidence sub
mitted for consideration. In this
connection such procedure will nec
essarily have to wait on a reorganiza
tion of that committee because of the
vacancy in the chairmanship of the
committee, Senator William P. Dill
ingham of Vermont having died re
cently, the ranking member of the
committee ? s Senator Selden P. Spen
cer of Missouri, and it is likely that
he will succeed to the chairmanship.
Nothing whatever is now before that
committee in the Texas case. Attor
ney Scott Woodward of Forth Worth
and Luther Nichols, personal attor
new for Peddy, are the men who are
here pressing for an early hearing
of the case before the proper Senate
committee.
Formal Notice Filed
In the formal notice of contest filed
with the Senate declarations that the
Ku Klux Klan was instrumental in
securing Senator Mayfield’s election
were made and there also were
charges of corruption and irregular
ities which remain to be proven.
Senator Morris Sheppard, the sen
ior senator from Texas, today told
your representative he had nothing
in his possession to introduce in the
Mayfield case and would make, no
motion of his own accord. Neither
had he been approached or requested
to act on behalf of others interested,
Senator Sheppard said. There is
nothing, he added, to prevent Senator
Mayfield from being sworn in or tak
ing his office for, in reality, he has
been serving the people of Texas as
their junior senator since the fourth
of last March and is therefore in
office at the present time.
The fact that there is to be a re
organization of the Senate commiiee
on privileges and elections at the be
ginning of his session will, In all
probability, delay any action that
may hgve been anticipated in this
famous case and it may be some
time before any real action can be
taken. Meanwhile, Senator Mayfield
is sitting and serving as the junior
senator from Texas, notwithstanding
the protest that has been field with
the Senate.

—K-K-K
Brooklyn, N. Y.—Prediction that
nothing will keep the Ku Klux Klan
from swinging the balance of power
in New York state in 1924 in the
event William H. Anderson, state
superintendent of the Anti-Saloon
League, is convicted of the charge
that he appropriated $24,000 for his
personal use of money belonging to
the league, was by Mr. Ander
son in an address in the Greene Ave
nue Baptist church here last week.
Mr. Anderson declared that it was a
political frame-up fostered by Cath
olic politicians.
Mr. Anderson ridiculed the post
ponement of his trial by District At
torney Banton and called it a “mov
able feast.” After pointing out that
in October trial was postponed to
November and that now, “four weeks
later, after the election, and in the
light of the result,” there had been an
other postponement, Mr. Anderson
said:
“If Mr. Banton is telling the truth
when he says that time for prepara
tion is needed, then he stands convict
ed of having brought about my indict
ment for political purposes last sum
mer without having a case.
“On the other hand, if Mr. Pecora
was telling the truth last July and
August when he said, “We are ready
for trial on 25 hours’ notive,’ and Mr.
Banton was telling the truth last
month, three weeks before election,
when he said for publication, ‘We are
ready now,’ then there can be none
other than a sinister meaning to the
suggestion that further preparation is
needed.”
Mr. Andersoji referred to a denial
of the minutes of the grand jury to
him as follows:
, “The reaction from the denial by
an Irish-Catholic Tammany judge to
the superintendent of the enforcement
promotion agency of the dry Protest
ant churches of an inspection of the
minutes of the grand jury, while
granting it at the same time to six
others who apparently were either
Catholics or Jews, or represented by
attorneys who were such, so terrified
the wet masters of the district at
torney that the plan to have the trial
before election was precipitately
abandoned.
THOUSANDS WITNESS SPECTACULAR PARADE
' K-K-K
KLAN OBTAINS INJUNCTION TO BLOCK
INTERFERENCE WITH THEIR PAGEANT
-K-K
Williamson, W. Va.—One of the
most spectacular and sensational pa
rades ever seen county since
the famous march of miners in 1920
was staged here Wednesday night
iast, when hundreds of members of
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,
attired in full regalia of the Order,
paraded downtown streets.
More than 3,000 persons, the larg
est crowd to witness a single event
here since the famous march of min
ers, jammed downtown streets and
were packed on the sidewalks like
sardines in a can. There never was
as large a crowd on the streets of
Williamson before except on two oc
casions, aged resident declare.
While a mammoth Fiery Cross
blazed on a mountain overlooking
Reservation Hill and the city, the
marchers, carrying great sticks of
red and green fire, and headed by a
military band, marched on the down
town business section. Leading the
parade were two robed Klansmen
mounted on hooded steeds. Next
came a member of the Order carry
ing a miniature Fiery Cross illumi
nated with candles. Following im
mediately behind the cross was the
band, and then came the hundreds of
marchers.
Klan Gets Injunction
From time to time during the pa
rade rockets were set off on adjacent
hillsides and hissed their fiery way
high the heads of the marchers.
The appearance of each rocket was
preceded by heavy aerial bombing
and the bursting of the fireworks
brought subsequent reports.
Despite the fact that some of the
local authorities had opposed the
march and that considerable discus
sion of the ,4 invasion” Tiad been heard
in official circles, the parade went
over with a bang. The vast throng
that viewed the spectacle was as or
derly as the marchers themselves and
not once was there any sign of dis
order.
Pursuant to its ancient traditions
of always obeying the law, but fear
ing that the law might, in this case
become a boomerang, members of the
Klan secured an injunction against
local authorities restraining them
from interfering with the parade.
The injunction was issued by Judge
R. D. Bailey of Pineville. Had it not
been for the injunction it is believed
that the parade would have been
stopped by local authorities. How
ever, there is no law on the statute
books compelling an organization to
secure a permit to parade.
As a precautionary measure mem
bers of the police force were sta
tioned at various points throughout

PAPER SOUNDS THREAT
Predicts Bloodshed Should Kluxers
Exercise Rights and Assemble
—K-K-K
Atlantic City, N. J.—Mayor Bader,
declaring that he was a “Catholic and
proud of it,” has begun a campaign
against the Ku Klux Klan of this city
and intends, he says, to prevent the
Klan from parading. “It is not alone
as a churchman that the executive will
block public and spectacular proces
sions, or ceremonies,” says one At
lantic City paper. “It is his duty as
the titular head of the city govern
ment to preserve order and make the
streets safe for the public at all
times.”
Vieled Threat
In substantiation of its views that
the Klan will not be permitted to
parade in the city, this same paper
says, “Were the Klan to attempt to
stage a parade through certain sec
tions of the city the result might be
disorder, and might even result in
casualties.” The Klansmen of the city
admit that a parade might result in
casualties, but never on the initiative
of Klansmen.
It is said that although Mayor
Bader is forbidding the Klan to hold
orderly parades and ceremonials, his
police la~t week saw the landing of
30 cases of rum at Rum Point and
made no attempt to interrupt them in
their work.
Rome Plans War
A group of these anti-Klan friends
of Mayor Bader’s met in the parish
hall of St. Nicholas’ Catholic church
last week at the invitation of the
Knights of Columbus and heard dero
gatory addresses by the mayor;
Sullivan, chaplain of Atlantic City
post, No. 2, American Legion; and
Hugh P.
“Any man who covers his face with
a mask is a %rook and a coward,”
cried the mayor. “I want your organ
izations to appoint captains and lieu
tenants, and when I call you on the
telephone or the lights on Pacific
avenue show red six times, or the fire
signals call six times, I want you to
come to the city hall. Even if the
paraders are without masks, I want
you to come out.”
Klansmen in plain clothes mingled
with the throng while the parade was
in progress, and was ready at a mo
ment’s notice to assist police officers
in bringing to justice any person who
might have been inclined to cause a
disturbance.
« 400 Join Klan
Following the parade a big nat
uralization was put on at the Wil
liamson public school grounds. A
state officer of the Realm of West
Virginia addressed the larger crowd
which assembled at the grounds to
learn of the principles of the Klan.
In a concise and interesting manner
the Klan official expounded the prin
ciples of the organization and ex
plained in no ambiguous terms its
purpose.
More than two-thirds of the crowd
that saw the parade went to the
school grounds to hear the lecture.
Despite bits of wafting frost the au
dience braved the cold night air and
liftened intently to the discourse. It
is understood that several hundred
applications for membership were re
ceived at the meeting.
A class of approximately 400 per
sons was initiated. During the nat
uralization heavy bombing w r as heard
on the surrounding hills and a huge
Fiery Cross illumined the grounds
where the ceremony was in progress.
The naturalization grounds were
separated from the outside world by
ropes, resembling a roped arena.
Outside the ropes were two lines of
robed Klansmen. One line was fac
ing outward while the other line was
facing inward. The candidates
marched in between the two lines.
The ceremonies lasted until nearly
midnight, after which the great mass
of immaculate figures melted away
and Williamson once again became
the little mountain city in the heart
of the billion-dollar coal fields, with
no particular excitement or stir aside
from that of the usual routine of the
town.

“I am not now prepared to say
what action will be taken ultimately,' *

“because until we know whether the
oaths and obligations taken by Klan
