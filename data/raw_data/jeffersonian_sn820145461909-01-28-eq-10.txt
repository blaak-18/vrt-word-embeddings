A Tribute to Thomas Paine
By a Subscriber
When I look down through the vis
ta of the past to see the men and wo
men that have done great good in re
moving the heel of the tyrant from
the neck of the people, I find the
name of a man seldom mentioned in
periodical print, but whom it is im
possible to leave out when we make
a roster of the great reformers. This
man is Thomas Paine.
When the 29th of January rolls
around, I celebrate his birthday all
by myself. I read anew “The Crisis”,
I review “Common Sense”, 1 peep
again into “The Rights of Man’’, till
I can close my eyes and go over page
after page almost verbatim.
If no other man living or dead had
ever written a line against tyranny
except Thomas Paine in years present
and years to come, tyranny would
kneel at the feet of an enlightened
world. If no other man had ever
struck a blow at Special Privilege ex
cept Thomas Paine, Special Privilege
would never again be able to fatten on
a patient people. Tyranny and op
pression thrive on the ignorance and
cowardice of the people. No man can
be ignorant of government and read
the works of Thomas Paine. No won
der kings hated him. He knocked
their thrones from under them, —a
President, George Washington, took
the place of King’ George.
The priest claimed one-tenth of all
the poor man made. He collected it
because he succeeded in making the
poor man believe that God wanted the
poor man to pay it. He (the priest)
wore glittering and costly gowns made
after the style of a millionaire’s wife’s
dress. The tail of it was so long that
it took half a dozen boys to tote it
for him, and the poor looked on in
superstition and awe. The priest
made the poor and ignorant believe
that God wanted him to dress so
splendidly, while they must wear
rags.

a member of the legislature in voting
for a law that prohibited a man from
voting unless he was worth $5004-
Answer me that while you are here
face to face with these humble citizens
of Gordon county.” At this Mr.
Stephens rose again furious with in
dignation, and screamed: “It is false
sir, it is false; I deny the fact.”
“ 5 on do,” said Russell, scornfully,
“ I supposed you would—you deny the
fact. That is just what you have been
doing for twenty years—going about
over the country denying facts.” And
the crowd went wild with merriment,
for even the Whigs couldent help join
ing in the fun. Mr. Stephens turned
to his companions and said with a
tone of despair, “Let us go to the
hotel,” and they went.
I thought of all this while Mr.
Stephens was telling me of his tri
umphs over veteran foes, and so when
he came to a pause I timidly said:
“Mr. Stephens, did you ever encoun
ter a man by the name of Russell up
at Calhoun?”
Jeffersonian
EIS
Paine succeeded in convincing the
poor and ignorant man that this state
of affairs was not a God-decreed mat
ter, and .that the priest could dress in
anything he wished to if he paid for
it, but that the poor man was under
no moral or religions obligation to
pay for the luxurious living of any
man. Paine advised the people to
keep back the tithe for themselves and
their families, and give to religion only
what they were able to spare. Put
ting this into practice, the working
man was no longer so poor nor so
ignorant. Believing that charity be
gan at home, the common man felt it
to be a religious duty to educate and
make comfortable his own family.
Superstition having left the man, the
devout priest no longer had superhu
man power over him.
Then the priest began to hate and
malign Paine. Paine retorted with
“The Age of Reason”. Then' Mr.
Priest got furious, and to this day the
Catholic Church has hated the name
of Thomas Paine.
Sometimes it seems to me almost a
pity that Mr. Paine wrote the “Age
of Reason”, because it killed the in
fluence of his political works to some
extent. Every lover of freedom would
be benefitted if he would read the
political works of Thomas Paine, but
a great many Christian people do not
want his books in their houses on ac
count of his attitude against the
Church, thus losing sight of his plea
for the political and individual free
dom of mankind.
I honor the name of Paine because
he fought for every man in this
world who lived on the work and labor
of his fellow man. He risked his life
to give me liberty. I have had no
king, no throne, no tithe-collector, but
when I look back a few years I see
all three. I investigated to see who
removed them, and I found foremost
in the ranks of the brave battlers for
the right the name of Thomas Paine.
"With a merry glistening of his won
derful eyes he straightened up and
said: “I did, I did, yes, 1 did. I will
never forget that man. He got me
completely. If I had known him 1
would not have said a word in reply,
hut I dident know him. He cured me
of one expression J frequently used
to emphasize my denial of lies and
slander, and that was to say: ‘I deny
the tact.’ I had never thought of its
grammatical absurdity, but that man
Russell taught me and I quit it. I
think he had the most wonderful flow
of language and lies of any man I ever
met.” Mr. Stephens then made a
pretty fair recital of his rencounter
and his “utter defeat,” as he express
ed it, all of which we enjoyed. Where
are they now? Old Father Time has
cut them all down but three, Harde
man and Thornton and myself are
here, but all the rest of that bright,
intelligent crowd are gone. It looks
like most everybody is dead. If they
are not they will be before long, and
another set will be in their places and
have their jokes and flash their wit
and merriment all the same. —Bill
