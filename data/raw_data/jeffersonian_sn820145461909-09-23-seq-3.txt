THE VETERANS’ CORNER
Amos Rucker, Colored, Confed
erate Veteran

L
IKE the bison and the buffalo,
the “old-time negro” will soon
be extinct. The new negro of
the new South will be the ne-
gro of the future.
His interest and significance is
large, for he is the “negro problem.’’
It is, however, a different interest
altogether from that of the “old
time negro”. He is a totally differ
ent phenomenon, and authentic rec
ords of him should be preserved for
historical, no less than sentimental,
reasons, for he is rapidly passing
away, and, when he goes, we “shall
not look upon his
like again.”
Smaller each year
grows the little
company of colored
folks who,' through
all the horrors of
war, the chaos of
reconstruction x and
the alienation of
these piping times
of equality, have
unfalteringly per
sisted in their atti
tude of affection
ate loyalty towards
“their white folks”.
Among this ever
lessening band of
faithful servants,
these “white-folks’
niggers”, as their
own race call them
now, there could
have been number
ed no more inter
est in g character
than that of an old
negro man who
passed away some
months ago in At
lanta. Throughout
the whole South it
would have been
difficult to find a
more striking or
dramatic figure than that of Amos
Rucker, whose bright, black face,
with its friendly smile, was known
and loved of all men in the
city where he lived and died.
Amos “belonged” to the Rucker
family of Elbert County, and when
his “young marster”, Sandy Rucker,
went to the war, Amos went with
him. In the wonderful record of the
fidelity of the negroes of the South
to the homes and families of their
masters during war times, a most
striking example was furnished by
tbe “likely young colored boys” who
followed their young masters to the
army as “body-servants”. A story is
told of a report made by a subordi
nate officer to General Grant of rein
forcements to General Lee’s army of
“90 privates from the University of
Virginia with 90 body-servants”.
In the thrilling records of those
dramatic days these negro body-ser
vants deserve a chapter to them-

selves. Many weeping mothers laid
the care of dashing young officers
and privates upon black Jim or Sam
or Andrew: and hunger or cold, pri
vation and the temptation to desert
to the better provided side develop
ed few Judases among them. Uni
formly true to the trust “old Miss”
imposed, they acted as cook, valet
and general utility men, a very im
portant part of their service being
that of foraging in starvation times.
Where the fortunes of war were
favorable, master and man came
home together; while every Southern
AMOS RUCKER
town holds among the pathetic an
nals of these fearful days, stories of
painful and difficult journeys through
hostile lines when the bodies of
young heroes were brought back to
weeping mothers by these same col
ored boys, who thus proved them
selves “faithful unto death”.
Notable among this class of body
servants was Amos Rucker, whose
young master early enlisted in the
Thirty-third Georgia Regiment, a
part of the Division of General Pat
rick R. Cleburne. This Division
caught some of the heaviest fighting
of the war, and Amos not only ac
companied his master into every en
gagement, but, standing side by side
with him, he fought like an enlisted
soldier. When in the trenches or in
a charge, a gun or a saber would fall
from the hands near to him, Amos
was ever quick to snatch it up and
push forward to close up the ranks
His enthusiasm for the cause of
Jeffersonian
the Confederacy was sincere and per
sonal. It was his master’s cause and
therefore his, but, once enlisted in it,
the fire and fervor of the fray be
came his own, and when he died
there ceased to beat a heart as loyal
to the Lost Cause as any that took
flight under Lee at Gettysburg, or
Jackson at Bull Run.
This enthusiasm it was which
made for Rucker his picturesque and
unique position as the acquaintance
and personal friend of nearly every
white person in Atlanta. After the
war, when,in too many instances, the
hands of white and black were turn
ed against each other, Rucker knew
nothing of the storm. To him the
solving of the negro problem was ex
quisitely simple. The white folks
were his folks: they would take care
of him, and they did. When many
years ago, his health grew feeble
and he was unable to work, Amos
knew no care. In his uniform of
Confederate gray, -which he wore to
the day of his death, he went cheer
fully about the streets of Atlanta,
beaming upon old and young alike,
and as secure of all that was needful
as are the lilies of the field.
Rucker was one of the few ne
groes who held membership in a
camp of Confederate Veterans.
He regularly belonged to Camp W.
H. T. Walker, U. C. V., and never
failed to attend a reunion, no matter
how far it might be from Atlanta.
On these occasions, the little old
darkey with the white head and the
gray clothes, attracted any amount
of attention, and was often the cen
ter of an interested group while he
performed a remarkable feat of mem
ory in calling verbatim the roll of
his master’s old regiment. From A
to Z, from color-sergeant to the last
private, in the voice of the orderly
sergeant, Rucker would run through
the roll, answering each name, some
times ‘here”, often, very often,
“dead or “wounded”. He loved to
be called upon to give his roll-call,
and it was a great occasion with him,
when, at a meeting of the camps, a
request would be made for it, as was
often done. Some verses written
several years ago by a veteran com
rade affords an idea of how Rucker
and his roll-call were regarded by the
camps: •
When Rucker Calls the Roll.
By F. O. Chase.
How thick the mem’ries come to
mind,
Os many a tented plain,
Os fading lines, of faded gray,
And ghastly heaps of slain,
Os bugles blaring through the night
In tones that stir the soul,
The days of ’62 come back,
When Rucker calls the roll.
Full many a roll call comes to mind,
Full many a sad parade
Os muskets glinting down the line
And gleam of saber blade,
Though few they be who do not
sleep
Beneath some grassy knoll,
In vivid visions all come back
When Rucker calls the roll.
Then here’s to Rucker—loyal heart,
Faithful and tried and true—
And when death’s bugle sounds for
taps
Our prayer shall go with you.
