Eruptions
Dry. moist, scaly tetter, all forms of
eczema or salt rheum. pimples and
other cutaneous eruptions proceed from
burners, either inherited, or acquired
through defective digestion and as
simi.ation.
To treat these eruptions with drying
rl .:fines is dangerous..
The thing tc do is to help the sys

PARK BENJAMIN.
Press on I surmount the rocky steeps,
Climb boldly o'er the torrtnt's aron;
Be atlle slone who feebly ereep I
sHe wtin who dareo the heros's march.
Be thou a herol let thy might
Tramp on eternal snows ts way,
And, through the eboe walls of night.
Rew down a passage unto day.
Press on! If ones and twile thy feet
Slip back and stumble, harder try;
From him whomever dreads to meet
Danger and death, they're sure to fyr.
To ooward ranks the ballet speeds,
While on theitr breast who never quall,
leamas, guardian of ehivalrle dgeds,
B ight courage, like a oost of mall.
Press on if Fortune play the false
, Today, tomorrow .he'll be true;
Whom now she esink, she now exalts,
Takilg old gifts and granting new.
The wisdom of the present hour
Makes up the folles past and gore,
To weakness, strength succeeds, anad
power
From frailty sprlngs! Press oe, press on.
Therefore, press on, and reash the goal,
And gala the pr ., and wear the orown;
Faint not, for to .he steadfast soul
Come w . Ith, and honor, and renown.
To thins own sell be true, and keep
Thy mind from slotb, thy heart from soil,
Prees on, and thou shalt surely reap
A heavely harvest for thy tell.

C(ON FEERBATE RE UNION.
Diveiged Views of Vets From
Memphis.
Tte Confederate re-union, as it is styled,
sle over. There was a big crowd in Mem
phis and the Men.hlans are rejoiting over
their success.
But why should tubh a gathering he
misnamed a Confederate reunion? Here
In substarce Is the recital of Vets who
were there:
Sald a i.et, who is one of a gereral'!
stat: "It was a grand, a most successful
gathering. The streets were Ijmnied with
people ard the old Vets were we:comed
everywhere. The Louisiana division was
conepicuoue in the parade and received
cheers all along the line. I was well
treated, delightfully entertain , as were
ny friends and others who wer with me."
Said a Vet who, as a free lance and
weres no un:lorm: "I went to emphls to
see the show. I wse not diuapiointed. It
was a great show, where the dld Confed
erate soldit r, without, uniform, was ".ost
in the sbuit ." 1J many latahces he had
to ehitt for limself, but, this could not be
avoecd when .o great a crowd is gath
ered in a town. But, 1 may say I never
s~w as mat y eeuera;s, and colonels, they
Wrie everywhere, and as to majors and
captains, why, they appeared to be more
numerous than the privates, but, they were
all happy in ttheir Iglory and their talioi
made undforms."
said a Vet, cool headed, conservative,
unas.eming, observant, Intelligent, a
gentleman of great lnfluence, who has had
years of experience In dealing with mean
and who appreciates the weakness as
well as the noble characteristics of m.n:
"Mempnls was crowded; the streets
were jammed. The entertalonments
were many. I saunterea everywhere
I am as lamillar with Memphis as, I am
with r.reasport. The citizens of Mem
phis responded nobly and generously, and
should be credited for their efforts, but
the reunion was disappolantig to the
Veterans, at least to the great majority.
The reniona was a big show, where the
omoers in uniform overshadowed the
soldiers, and as was saia by a friend In
Memphis, an ola Reob: 'The whole thing has
run from generals to sponsors, sad maids
of honor, and Bons of Veterans, and we
are not in It.'"
l Several entertainments which were billed
for the Vete were postponed because these
interfered with some sootal funations. I
have reached the coneluelon that the
reunion was a great success for Memphisl
for the generals and the oitce,.. the spon
sors, the maids of honor and the ongs of
Veterans. but a grand humbug, at least a
tar as the Veterans are concemned.
