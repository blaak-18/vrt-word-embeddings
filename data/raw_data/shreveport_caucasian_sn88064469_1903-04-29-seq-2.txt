OMAHA'S WELCOME.D
Presldent Roosevelt Greeted Thiere bly
Fully Fifty Thouqand People.
Omaha, Neb.. April 29.-President
Roosevelt, after a circuitous, trip Mon
day through Nebraska wind, dust and
rain at night. addressed 10,000 people
in the Coliseum at Omaha. He was
acorded an enthusiastic ovation by the
throng. The building was decorated
with flags of the United States and
with colors of the Ak-Sar-Ben society.
As the president and his party and
escorts entered the Coliseum, the hand
strugk up "Rail to the Chief." The
president bowed his greetings to the
audience, and after the preliminary re
marks, made his speech.
The president devoted most of his
speech to the question of good citizen
ship and thoroughly went over the
ground he has heretofore covered on
this subject. He also delivered a brui
eulogy on the life of General U. S.
Grant, Monday being the anniversay of
his birth.
Omaha is threatened with an indus
trial strike on May 1, and the presi
dent was asked to say something on
this subject. lie said in part:
"Capitalists and wage workers alike.
should honestly endeavor each to look
at any matter from the other's stand
noint, with a freedom from the con
temptible arrogance which looks down
on the man of less means, and with
a freedom from the no less contempti
ble envy, jealousy and rancor which
hates another because he is better off.
(Aplause).
"Any man who tries to excite class
hatred. sectional hate, hate of creeds,
any kind of hatred in our community,
though he may affect to do it in the
interest of the cause he is aiding is a
long run with absolute certainty that
classes own worst enemy." (Applause).
President Roosevelt arrived in Oma
ha at 6:15 o"clock and was welcomed
by 50,000 persons. The sand driven by
a wind that followed the president
from the time he left Grand Island
in the morning and which had pestered
him at Hastings, at Fairmont and at
Crete, was washed away temporarily at
Lincoln by rain. Brief stops at Wahoo
and at Tremont gave the party another
taste of sand and all were tired when
the train rolled into Omaha.

lowed by the king, numbered 40.00.,
and included 10,000 to 12,00u British

shown by the number of stars and
stripes displayed.
The most imposing moment of the
reception was shortly after King Ed
ward entered the Quirinial. The playa
below was packed with thousands of
people who acclaimed his majesty
frantically until he was obliged to ap
sear twice on a balcony with Queen
Helena on his right and King Victor
Emmanuel on his left and surrounded
by Italian princes. King Edward, by i
his gestures, clearly expressed the deep
est appreciation of the significance of
the scene. After a short rest at the
Quirinial, King Edward re-entered his

New York, April 29.-Leopold Wer
theimer, a wealthy dry goods merchant,
was shot three times in his home in
West One Hundred and Fifteenth
street. Hle was wounded in the chest,
arm and right side, and is in a serious
condition. Charged with the shooting,
the police arrested Joseph Simpson,
thirty years old, of East One Hundred
and Twenty-fist street. The injured
man is thirty-two years old and a
member of the firm of Aaron & Wer
thelmer, dry goods merchants, who
were recently burned out at their place
of business in Third avenue. Simp
son, the police say, was employed there
as a watchman prior to the fire. At
the time of the fire two persons were
burned to death.
The motive for the shooting is a
mystery both to the police and the
Wertheimer family, and nampson, who
was very cool when arrested, refused
to make any statement. Since the fire
Wertheimer has not been engaged in
any business. The firm discharged its
employee, Including Simpson, but he
got work as a motorman. A week ago
he lost that position and he had a long
talk with Mr. Wertheimer Monday af
ternoon and returned that night. He
again talked with Mr. Werthelmer and
the family thinks Simpson demanded
money. He returned to the Werthelmer
home at an early hour to-day and
the shooting occurred in the hallway
of the house, after which Simpson
went away and later was arrested.
