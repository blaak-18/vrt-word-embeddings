The World for 1880.
Democrats everywhere bshoud lnfom
themselves carefully alike o the action
of their party throughout the country
and of the movements of their Repabl .
ean oppoents. A failure to do this in
1876o eotributed greatly to the loss by
the Democraoey o the fruit of victory
fairly won at the polls.
The year 1880 prmises to be one of
the moseet interesting and important years
of this rowded and eventful cantury.
