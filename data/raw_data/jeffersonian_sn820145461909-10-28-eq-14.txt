ing a young coquette's vanity—and
nobody could deny that Kate was a
good deal of a flirt; but it really was
a pleasure to me to observe the
trembling lip and moistened eye with
which she received my statements.
“You see,’’ I concluded, as a fin
ishing stroke, “my tastes and
Bourke’s are quite different.”
“Bourke! Don’t mention Bourke,
please!”
This was so open a bid for me to
make a fool of myself that I remon
strated.
“See here, Katharine, I may be fat
—well, I am fat—but I’m not every
thing that begins with an f.”
“You mean you are not a fool,” she
said. “I think you are. A man’s
never quite such an idiot about —
about certain things as when he be
lieves he isn't —when he thinks he
knows it all!”
The speech was not conciliatory;
but the tears which came with it were
more than I could bear. I caught the
two little hands, and drew her around
to face me. We were quite alone in
our josshouse, and I asked tremu
lously :
“What’s the matter, dear? Tell
me. You know I will make it all
right for you. I always have—l al
ways do, don’t 1?”
“You can't do anything about
this,” she mourned. “It’s Bourke!”
I sat upright suddenly, and almost
pushed her away. Here she was

grieving for Bourke, and I had been
such a conceited fool as to fancy that,
she cared about what my ideals were!
“He’s coming home,” she whisper
ed. “I got a telegram. He turned
back at Tampa.”
In the excitement of this news it
did not occur to me to observe that
Kate ought naturally to have been
delighted over it instead of weeping.
I got abruptly on my feet. I went
and stood in the summer-house door.
How things had changed for me in
one moment! And yet, what a fool
a man can be! What had I had the
moment before? A little cheat of
happiness; a paltry and humiliating
position which a man of spirit would
never have accepted.
I looked out and saw Bourke de
scending from the auto which the
hotel sent to the station to meet
guests. I put my fingers to my lips,
and gave the old-time whistle with
which all the boys on our block used
to call one another. He turned, saw
me, waved his hand, and I beckoned.
“Here comes Bourke,” I said to
the girl behind me in the summer
house. “I’m going.”
There were two doors to the sum
mer-house. Kate caught my arm as
I passed her.
“Don’t! You mustn’t. Stay and
tell him—tell him —you mustn’t
go!”
I looked down at her sternly yet
longingly.

“Tell him what?” I asked. “Tell
him that I've been in love with the
girl he’s engaged to ever since we
were children? Tell him that I can’t
get over it to suit him —Just simply
because she’s to be my sister-in-law?
Tell him —oh, Kate you push a man’s
strength too far! You expect too
much of me. I’m only human, like
the rest of them. I can’t help loving
you, and I haven’t the grace to keep
still about it! ”
All at once I knew why I had been
made so big and strong. It seemed
to me for one dizzy instant that it
was to take care of this sweetest and
tenderest of God’s creatures. I
dropped my hands softly down to her
arms, and, lifting her as I had done
many a time when she was a child, I
kissed her softly and sorrowfully on
lips that answered mine. Then I set
her down.
“Bourke’s coming,” I whispered—•
of course I would put an anti-climax
to a scene like that —and I shot out
of one door as he entered by the
other.
HI.
I walked blindly for a few mo
ments, with Kate’s kiss on my lips,
her voice in my ears —crying after
me:
“Carl —Carl—don’t go!”
When I thought they had had time
for their lover’s raptures, I went de
liberately back —better have it /over
now. They didn’t look very raptur
ous as I went in. Bourke nodded a
careless greeting; Katharine was in
the middle of a sentence.
“I tell you I never cared anything
at all about you, Bourke,” she w r as
saying. “I didn’t think, and don’t
think, that you care anything about
me. You just have to flirt with every
girl that’s around. I engaged myself
to you, to see if I couldn’t make him
notice it, anyhow. If I was mistaken,
and have really hurt you, I’m sorry.”
Oh, then it wasn’t Bourke, but
someone else! I was surprised to find
it a relief to know that I should not
have Katharine for a sister-in-law.
I wasted no thought upon Bourke’s
suffering from any sentimental
wound.
And I was right in this, it seems;
he looked from one to the other of
us with dancing eyes.
“Well, then,” he said gaily, “I’m
to understand that you two are en
gaged—genuinely engaged. I call
that a pretty state of affairs for a man
to find awaiting him. You’re a nice
brother, Charlie, you are!”
“No, we’re not,” complained Kath
arine, between petulance and laugh
ter. “It isn’t my fault, I’m sure;
but the stupid old thing won’t ask
me! ” " Y ®
A great light was breaking upon
me. I don’t think I said anything;
I don’t know what I did; but my
next consciousness was that I was
standing with my arm around Kate,
facing my returned brother.
“The very thing!” exclaimed that
individual. “Kate’s been hopelessly
gone on you for years; I knew it, but
I never gave her any encourage
ment,” he rattled off merrily. “Well,
you two are engaged and I’m
married! Don’t all speak at once,
please. Yes, it’s a new one. I met
her at Tampa. She was staying with
the Heywards. Her father had just
died, and things were going to be
pretty hard for her.”
“Married!” repeated Katharine,
with an incredulous note in her voice.
“Where’s your wife?”
But her suspicions were unfound
ed; the wife was produced in due
season. We held a little family ban
quet that evening in one of the hotel
ordinaries, to present Bourke’s wife
and announce my engagement. When
it came to toasts and speechmaking,
Bourke made some extremely bril
liant remarks about the return of the
prodigal and the slaying of the fatted
calf. He was supposably the prodi
gal and he alleged that the latter ani
mal had fallen to Katharine’s bow
and spear.—Munsey’s Magazine.
AS TO THE PURPOSES OF THE
CITY POLITICIANS.
(Concluded from Page 7)
out the Journal endorsed it as ac
curate, but immediately after Mr.
Smith’s return to Atlanta, the Jour
nal had to back-track, and Smith be
gan to denounce the report. Mr.
Smith had declared publicly that on
January 1, 1910, the State would
have a surplus of about $400,000 in
the treasury. The report of the ex
pert accountant showed, however,
that on January 1, 1910, the defi
cit would be upwards of $700,000.
Therefore, the difference between
what Mr. Smith had said and what
the expert accountant said amounts
to more than a million dollars.
Now, why should any citizen be so
hard to convince that the Journal is
capable of telling a falsehood?
In another back-number issue of
the Atlanta Journal you will find that
they said, “This election law provides
machinery by which the taxpayer is
automatically registered at the time
he pays his taxes.” Again, it said, “If
the tax-collector does his duty, the
taxpayer, who by the full payment of
his taxes becomes a regular voter,”
etc. So you can see very clearly
that at first the man who wrote those
editorials did not know the provis
ions of the law which he was discus
sing.
A typographical error in my edi
torial made me say “the acts of
1909.” Os course, I meant to say
the “acts of 1908.” Get them and
read them for yourself, page 58, as I
remember, and you will see that the
Journal was altogether wrong in say
ing that the law does anything au
tomatically. It is true that after the
Telegraph and The Jeffersonian ex
posed the Atlanta Journal, it then
began to crawfish and to state the
real nature of the law. Mr. Smith
himself wrote to the Farmers’ Union
News and misrepresented the state of
the case. He declared that the ob
ject of closing the books so early was
to give the registrars plenty of time
to purge the lists. The acts them
selves show that the registrars
must not be later than June Ist in
completing and purging the lists,
and that not later than June sth
they must give to the Clerk a com
plete and purged list, alphabetically
arranged by country districts and
city wards. After June sth it would
be unlawful for anybody to put a
name on those lists or to take one
off.
Now, under another law of 1908,
the primary can’t be held earlier
than the x first week in August, it
may be held later than that; it can
not be held earlier. Therefore, the
voter loses two full months of op
portunity for registering. Why
