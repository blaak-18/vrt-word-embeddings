This issue i 3 the last one of The Call of The North. Starting
next week, the Klansmen and Protestant Americans of Minnesota
will be presented with the first number of The Minnesota Fiery
Cross, the official organ of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in
the Gopher state.
In a previous issue we related in detail the story of the Wash
ington Bureau of Publication and Education established at the na
tion’s capital, by which the Minnesota Fiery Cross and all other
official Klan publication will be supervised.
It has long been the practice ofO
large city dailies to distort the facts t
relative to the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan, for one reason or another. ]
Protestant Americans in Minnesota, t
as well as 29 other states in the ]
Union will no longer have to rely up- 1
on the established wire services for ]
reports of Klan activities. A news i
service, which in time will be in a po- i
sition to compete competently with t
the long established companies, is
being perfected. \
am: . Important News f j
Not only will news concerning the j
organization itself and its activities
be spread by this service, with the
Washington Bureau as the fountain
head, but information that is of vi
tal importance to every American
voter, will be disseminated. While 1
The Fiery Cross of each state will be 1
the principal organ through which 1
this service will be presented to the 1
public, other publications may ob- 1
tain it for the asking.
At the present writing there are
30 state Klan newspapers. The rea
son for bringing them under one head
is to conform their editorial poli
cies and make such the voice of the
national organization. Heretofore
•an- independent Klan paper has pre
sented the viewpoint of the organiza
tion on current topics as it was the
light of the editor to see such. Prob
ably no two of these independent
journals took a like stand on any one
question. Thus, with so diversified
a field of opinion, no coherent, na
tional policy could be maintained.
Under the present policy, a Klans
man in California will know the
truth concerning congressional ac
tivities, for instance, at the same
time as does a member in Maine.
And knowing the full, true facts,
Klansmen the nation over will react
to them as a unit.
Twenty-three state editions of The
Fiery Cross are now being published
from Indianapolis, the birthplace of

Atlanta, Ga.—The launching of an
anti-Klan organization by E. Y.
Clarke to be called “Mystic Knights,”
composed of Jews and Catholics and
disgruntled Protestants, at his meet
ing called here for February 26, is to
be the next step in his campaign to
wreck the Klan. According to rumor
prevalent in Klan circles, this is the
real purpose of the meeting, and not
as set forth in his “call,” for the pur
pose of attempting to correct any
imaginary wrong in the Klan. It is
rumored that resolutions are being
prepared by Clarke, for adoption by
those attending the meeting, in which
he condemns the membership re
striction of the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan as undemocratic.
In discussing the purported new
organization and the admission of
Jews and Catholics to its member
ship, Klansmen point out that Clarke
has always been more or less favor
able to lifting the Klan’s restrictions
with reference to Catholics as evi
denced by several public statements

The Minnesota Fiery Cross will be
published in St. Paul, and will carry
the dispatches of the Washington Bu
reau, the full editorial service, from
the pens of the ablest writers and
publicists of the day in their respect
ive fields* and the many desirable
features of the Fiery Cross publica
tions.
P. J. Orn, who has been editor of
the Call of the North since its first
issue will continue indefinitely as
editor of the Minnesota Fiery Cross.
“Twilight” trusts that he’ll get in the
future, the same co-operation as he
has received in the past.
A state policy similar to the na
tional policy, of the paper will be
maintained under the direction of
the state office. Minnesota Klan
news—and there will be plenty of it,
now that the entire state is open for
propagation—will be featured. News
of interest to all Americans in the
state will also find space in the col
umns of The Minnesota Fiery Cross.
The new publication will be eight
pages weekly. For the present it
will be published by contract, but in
the near future it is the plan of the
Washington Bureau to install com
plete plants in every state where a
Fiery Cross publication is estab
lished. Following that it will not be
long before daily newspapers, with
their policies conforming to Klan
principles will make their appearance.
A word must be said concerning
the pioneer work of the Call of The
North, which blazed the trail, so to
speak, in Minnesota and laid the first
foundation upon which the Minnesota
Fiery Cross is to be built. All honor
and credit goes to the valiant men,
advertisers and readers who in days
when it was almost a disgrace in the
public eye to belong to the Klan, had
the courage to carry out and live up
to their convictions.
made by him when he was Imperial
Wizard pro tem, one of which was
given world-wide publicity by the As
sociated Press.
A real estate transaction in which
Clarke figured last week involving
the lease of a large building on
Peachtree Road near the Imperial
Palace, it was rumored, was intended
for headquarters for the new anti-
Klan organization. Investigation,
however, discloses that the lease was
not secured.
Clarke is not only silent with ref
erence to any plans that he might
have for his coming “congress” or
for launching his new organization,
but is decidedly inactive, apparently
making no preparation for either.
Just what part Simmons is taking
with Clarke,, in this new movement
to wreck the Klan is not definitely
known though according to rumor he
will head the new organization. The
only active support that Clarke seems
to have at present is his bookkeeper,
E. J. Jones, who has made several
trips to Washington within the last
few weeks, it is said, for the pur
pose of conferring with the enemies
of Senator Mayfield in an endeavor
to secure information detrimental to
the Klan to be used as propaganda in
launching Clarke’s new organisation,

Is He the Master Mind?
Washington, D. C., Feb. I.—The
way that man Edward L. Doheny,
prominent character in the oil-lease
scandal, bobs up here with important
developments, makes senators, con
gressmen, newspaper men and about
everybody else gasp with astonish
ment at the things he-pulls over and
then tells about it.
It has just been recalled that Do
heny was the principal “angel” ’for
Ramonn De Valera’s campaign for
“Irish Freedom” in this country not
so long ago.. During the year or two
preceeding the establishment of the
Irish Free State, Doheny was presi
dent of the “American Association for
Recognition of the Irish Republic.”
It has also been disclosed here or
rather recalled by senators that this
same Doheny contributed the sum of
$25,000 to the Republican national
campaign fund and at the same time
gave three times as much, $75,000
to the Democrats for their campaign
fund four years ago.
Mr. Doheny was given the floor at
the Democratic national convention in
1920 to submit a minority report from
the committee on platform. In the
course of his speech he read the re
port, which favored recognition of Ire
land. He said it was practically his
maiden effort at speech making and
he followed such eminent orators as

Following Receipts of mailed invi
tations to attend a closed lecture on
Americanism at the armory Wednes
day evening, 200 men of Fairmont
and vicinity assembled to hear an ex
cellent address by an unknown organ
izer for the Ku Klux Klan, which is
said to already have a membership
of 1,500 in Martin county and is a
power to be reckoned with. Some 50
new members were reported to have
joined last night.
At the conclusion of the two hours
patriotic talk every person present
arose as evidence of approval of the
klan and its principles—some no
doubt with mental reservation on
some points, but believing that the
klan if active only along the lines dis
cussed by the speaker can be a great
power for better government and im
proved citizenship.
Some who were not already ac
quainted with the principles of the
klan were surprised to find that the
address was not a tirade against the
Jews, negroes, and non-Protestants,
but almost wholly an exhortation to
better citizenship.
The speaker declared that the klan
stands squarely behind the constitu
tional guarantee of religious freedom,
but insists that no clerical or reli
gious organization shall control Amer*
ic« or interfere with liberty of con
science, thought or lawful act. Poli
tically the klan supports no party, he
asserted, but lends its assistance in
electing the best man to office and
then, what is more important, stand
ing squarely and unitedly behind
such officers in the enforcement of the
laws.
Says Klan Backs Dry Laws
The speaker stressed the fact that
the klan upholds the prohibition
amendment. “Whether the individ
ual klansman is in sympathy with
the amendment or not, cuts no figure,”
he stated. “He stands for the en
forcement of every law on the statute
books, and believes the man who vio
lates the eighteenth amendment is as
much of a traitor to the flag as the
man who violates any other law.
“The klan has received credit for
making a cleanup on booze in a cer
tain town in Ohio. That is not whol
ly true. The sheriff and deputies

But the newest sensation that Mr.
Doheny has sprung, he pulled here
today when he disclosed to the naval
oil reserve investigating committee
that he had employed on a wholesale
scale ex-members fof Presidential cab
inets to act as cotinsel for his various
oil interests.
While the conutiittee sat gasping
for breath at revelation Mr. Do
heny calmly recited how he had em
ployed William $. McAdoo, former
secretary of the Treasury; Thomas W.
Gregory, former attorney. general,
and now one of the attorneys Presi
dent Coolidge has selected to prose
cute in the oil scandal; Franklin K.
Lane, former secretary of the inter
ior; and Lindley sf. Garrison, former
secretary of war.
Mr. McAdoo, the witness said, waa
still in his emplQy at a salary of $50,-
000 a year and that the candidate for
the Democratic nomination had been
paid a total of $250,000 salary up to
date.
But the thing that makes people
gasp is the fact that Doheny has for
merly employed Mr. Gregory, whom
President Coolidge has just picked
to help prosecute in this case. **
made the cleanup, with the assist
ance of klansmen. The klansmen
discovered a place where bootlegging
was carried on. For two nights the
klansmen sat in trees and obtained
the names of all the men who entered
the place. At three o’clock one morn
ing, when all the bootleggers were in
the building, they telephoned the
sheriff who brought his deputies, raid
ed the place and took the liquor law
violators to jail. And the judge, who
was a klansman, sent them to the
penitentiary for two years.
Outrages by Members Deprecated
“It is a part of the constitution and
creed of the Klansman to uphold the
constitution. Therefore its members
do not believe in taking the law into
their own hands. You have read of
certain outrages alleged to have been
committed by the klan. That is not
trap. I challenge any man here to
prove it is true. It is true, however,
that certain men who were klansmen
have taken the law into their own
hands and committed outrages to the
discredit of the order, the same as
have members of lodges, churches
and other organizations.”
At the close of the lecture the
speaker asked all who believed in the
principles and aims of the klan, as
outlined, to stand up. Every person
in the armory arose. “AH who wish
to affiliate with this order, be seated,”
he said. All except one person seat
ed themselves. “I see one gentleman
standing,” said the lecturer. “Will
he please retire.” He did. Probably
fifty other then left the armory, the
others remaining, either to become
members or to witness the initiatory
ceremony. It was stated today that
25 to 50 joined.
Before the speaker asked the men
who believed in the principles of the
klan to stand, he asked persons of
foreign birth to leave the room. “We
have nothing against persons of for
eign birth,” he explained, “but our
charter, under which we operate, pro
vides that members shall be 'native
born, Gentile and Protestant,' and we
therefore cannot admit others.”
The Fiery Summons, an anti-ad
ministration .and perforce anti-Klan
sheet, carrying large pictures of Sim
mons and Clarke as Emperor and Im
perial Giant, respectively, made its
appearance on the streets of Atlanta
Friday. Its four, pages were devoted
principally to the proclamations of
Simmons and Clarke, which were
carried several weeks ago in the daily
press, and to article**, on' . Kamelia,
Simmons’ organization for women.

St Paul Klansmen Working Hard

Last meeting night the St. Paul
Klan turned out and revealed a most
delightful enthusiasm.
A greater number of men attended
this meeting than any one in the last
six months. More enthusiasm was
shown than has ever been shown in
the St. Paul organization since its
inception. New blood has been com
ing in so rapidly, that the interming
ling of oldi and new faces, after an
absence of three weeks makes one
feel very nearly a stranger. It is
this kind of enthusiasm of the mem
bership that shows the absolute cer
tainty of reaching our goal in the
Saintly City, along with the rest of
the state. -
The man in charge of the St. Paul
office is pne of those men who serves
as a field worker of the Klan because
he feels that whatever he does to
strengthen the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan will contribute that much
to a better and more glorious Ameri
ca.
It was said of him, and well said, as
a member of his home organization,
A He was the one man, through the
trying times of the early days of or
ganization who lost not faith.” He
is revealing that same faith in St.
Paul. If the proper support on the
part of the St. Paul Klan is continued
as in the last few weeks, nothing can
stop an overwhelming growth and
give to Minnesota one of the strong
est Klans in the United States.

Lincoln’s Loyal Legion is Another
Anti-Klan Organization Which
is Dae for an Early Demise
-K-K-K
Charleston, W. Va.—An amalgama
tion of all anti-Klan ' organizations
which will be the greatest inter-racial
organization ever effected, and which
will also bring about a “fair division
of school facilities and public advan
tages,” is the dream of Lincoln’s
Loyal Legion, an anti-Klan organiza
tion, it was disclosed here today.
Local Klansmen consider the move
ment a monumental farce and very
little credence is given it. Accord
ing to information received there are
no initiation fees and each-new mem
ber just makes a donation. A let
ter bearing the official letterhead of
the organization states that not one
of the officers receives a salary and
that all money is spent for stamps,
transportation, “overhead,” etc.
J. A. Downing, 305 South Filmore
stret, Edwardsville, 111., is the “Im
perial Eye,” or chief officer of the
organization, according to a state
ment made by Mr. Downing to the
Edwardsville Intelligencer recently.
According to Downing the “L. L.
L.” as he terms it, has been in exist
nce more than a year and has been
“very successful in many places in
thwarting the activities of the Klan.”
Mr. Downing fails to mention the
places, however. He states further
that his organization has now attain
ed such a membership that they are
ready to be known and will make an
organized fight against the Ku Klux
Klan.
In order to become a member of
Lincoln’s Loyal Legion one must be
100 per cent American and believe in
the doctrine of Americanism as con
tained in the Constitution of the
United States.
While this is the first time that
Lincoln’s Loyal Legion was ever
heard of in this section of West Vir
ginia, it is believed by most Klans
men that it is another organization
similar to the National Vigilance As
sociation whose demise was noted
some weeks ago.
It is noted with interest that all
checks are to be made payable to
J. A. Downing. Of course, the money
goes for “overhead.”
Constable Cagle, Klansman, Shot Down
by Members of Middle-west Coal
Field Gangsters.
BY INVESTIGATOR
Herrin, 111.—If “Bloody William
son” county were an actuality the
crimson stain would come from the
broken hearts of its best citizens;
men and women whose home town has
been ravished by rotten politicians,
bootleggers, gamblers, resort keep
ers and their supporters and patrons;
men and women jvho have seen their
“Main Street” /corrupted into an
avenue of pitfalls for sons and
daughters; men and women whose
lives and works as good citizens were
sacrificed by a small group of vicious
lawless men, incited by the basest
passions and mad with greed for
money and political power.
As a matter of fact “bloody Will
iamson” county exists today only on
the front pages of the yellow press,
except for that dark stained side
walk in front of th# Rome Club, where
Constable Caesar Cagle, Klansman,
died a martyr last week. He was
shot down by the gang that opposes
the reestablishment of law and order
in the coal fields.
With S. Glenn Young, noted law
enforcement officer, acting as chief of
police by appointment of John Ford,
Chief; with Mayor C. E. Anderson,
Sheriff George Galligan, Chief Depu
ty John Layman, Ora. Davis, v head of
the “Flaming Circle,” anti-Klan or
ganization, and a score of their assist
ants, deputies and henchmen under
arrest on charges of murder in con
nection with the death of Constable
Cagle; with men of unquestioned in
tegrity, practically all of whom are
said to be Klansmen, sworn in as po
licemen to replace the Ander-Galligan
piratical crew, Herrin is experienc
ing the restoration of order out of
chaos, and enjoying the life of a
well-regulated American town for
the first time in many a long day.
The raids led by Mr. Young, and
conducted by the best citizens of the
county, sworn in as officers for this
special duty, have closed up the sal
oons on the principal thoroughfares,
the joints directly across the street
from the city hall, and a half a hund
red “bootlegging dens” throughout
the county. Dozens of whisky ped
dlers, gamblers, gun men, and “im
ported gangsters” are under arrest
so this little city is now as quiet and
orderly as Chicago’s highbrow sub
urb, Evanston.
Were it not for the nine companies
of Illinois National Guardsmen call
ed here for some reason by Sheriff
Galligan before there was a hint of
trouble, and some hours before Con
stable Cagle was decoyed to his
death, Herrin with its autocratic, but
beneficient Acting Chief of Police
and his citizen aides, would be going
about its business in its usual way
with the exception, of course, that all
the “joints” are closed and the gang
sters that have given the community
a bad reputation these many years
are in jail “somewhere in Illinois.”
Klansmen and other good citizens
do not repent the presence of the
soldiers. They feel that their
presence is unnecessary; that the
state is put to a great expense and
the officers and men to a needless in
convenience by the mobilization here.
Interviews with more than twenty of
the most highly connected business
and professional men did not disclose
a single one who thought that the
soldiers should have been sent here.
News-stories asserting that thous
ands of miners in this district are
striking in order to fight the Klan
and the good citizens who stand with
that organization are untrue. I am
authorized to say that hundreds of
miners, the men who are known to be
stfeady, honest, hardworking, are
members of the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan. The United Mine Work
ers of America, radical labor organ
ization, to which all union miners
must belong attempts, by constitu
tional provision, to bar its members
from affiliation with the Klan, but
hundreds of Williamson county coal
miners are 100% Americans first, and
pawn’s of U. M. W., officials last, if
at all.
It is true that some miners are bit-

teily opposed to the Klan. The Ital-
ian colony and other foreign groups
in this district are large and these
groups are notoriously opposed u>
Americanized standards of life, citi
zenship and law enforcement. It is
from this class that Sheriff Galligau,
Ora Davis, and other leaders of the
“Corruption Ring” recruited confed
erates and selected their “hootch” re
tailers. Some of these men have
“laid off” from work in a futile effort
to keep in touch with their imprison
ed chiefs. They are the so called
“strikers.”
It is the concensus of opinion ex
pressed to me by a score of represen
tative men, including non-Kiansmcn
as well as members of that patriotic
organization, that eighty-five per cent
of the total population of Williamson
county is in entire sympathy and ac
cord with Mr. Young’s clean-up pro
gram and will support a movement to
make that stalwart officer sheriff of
the county as soon as Galligan is
convicted of murder or removed from
office.
With the best citizens, organized
for the first time in the cause of civic
righteousness and law enforcement,
determined to end the lawlessness
that has existed here under mayoral
regimes, IJerrin and Williamson coun
ty face the future with the convic
tion that even in the coal fields Amer
icanism shall triumph.
Discover Murder Plot
The conditions that forced William
son county’s best citizens to enforce
the laws laughed at by the despera
dos in public office spawned many
sinister plots and desperate deeds,
but even the infamous miners’ mass
acre of eighteen months ago was not
so cold-blooded in its lawlessness as
was the conspiracy that resulted in
the slaying of Constable Cagle, the
kidnapping of Chief of Police John
Ford, his assistant Harold Crane, and
the attempted assassination of Law
Enforcer Young, Sam Sterns, Exalt
ed Cyclops of the Marion Klan, A..e
Hicks, Police Magistrate, John Wh'te
side, Herrin business man and clean
up leader. The failure of the con
spirators to murder all of these
“marked men” is attributed by Young
to “a loss of nerve at the last min
ute” on the part of the gang leaders
who weakened when “Cagle pitched
forward on his face when shot in the
back.”
Constable Cagle was killed Friday
evening, February Bth. With fcis
wife he was attending a funct oi,
given in her honor, at the Mas l c
hall. His small son was down town
where he had been observed by the
enemy. When the youngster started
home he was stopped and directed to
go to the Masonic hall and inform his
father that “There is trouble down
at the ‘Rome’ club over the Jefferson
saloon. Come at once.” The inno
cent child delivered the message to
his father. Constable Cagle, good of-
ficer that he was, responded to the
call. As he approached the entrance
to the saloon he was met by a g ng
of men, one of whom struck him in
the face. As he fell he was shot
twice by other members of the gang,
and died on the sidewalk like a dog.
While this tragedy w£* being en
acted a similar message was sent to
Chief of Police Ford. He with Assist
ant Chief Crane, responded and up
on entering the “Rome” club, meet-
ing place of the notorious “Flaming
Circle” gang, the gangsters opened
fire upon them, disarmed and cap
tured them. During the shooting,
John Layman, Chief Deputy Sheriff
and one of the inmates of the resort
was wounded.

ber of his aides, returning to Herrin
from Marion, the county seat, to ar
rest the murderers and quell the ex

roadside. A volley of rifle shots
was poured into the automobile oc
