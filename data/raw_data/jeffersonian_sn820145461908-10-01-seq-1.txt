Summary of Ebents as They Happen
By Tom Dolan
Pope Pius X. ha§ inaugurated a
vigorous crusade against what he is
pleased to term “modernism.” The
first publication to come under the
papal ban is the Catholic Review, of
New York, always considered one of
the best of the Catholic Church pa
pers. It has been suppressed with
as iron a hand as the Middle Ages
ever knew.
New England, Western Pennsylva
nia, and other Northern States have
been suffering from a severe drought
and are badly injured.
Forest fires have been prevalent, wip
ing out vast areas of valuable timber
lands.
The National American Woman
Suffrage Association wull soon hold a
.convention in Buffalo, New 7 York, in
celebration of the sixtieth anniversary

men will be present.

Mr. James K. Vardaman, of Mis
sissippi, bitterly assails Henry Wat
terson for urging the negro toH 4in
crease his political importance,” but
has no condemnation for Wm. Jen
nings Bryan for doing the same thing.
Why jump on the subordinate for
carrying out the policy of the boss?
Rather than “embarrass” their
dear parties, both the Hon. J. B. For
aker, prominent Ohio Republican,
and Gov. Haskell, Treasurer of the
Democratic Campaign Committee,
have stepped aside, protesting their
spotless purity and innocence of any
dishonorable connection with the
Standard Oil Trust. There have been
thrusts and counter-thrusts, left-hand
hooks, upper cuts, jabs above and be
low the belt —but through it all one
can discern the deep disgust felt by
the slush-manipulators on both sides
that any henchman should be so rep
rehensible as to be —found out. They
are all daubed with the same brand of
crude petroleum.

It will be remembered that it was
Gov. Haskell who devised the Bryan
scheme of guaranteeing bank depos

the 44 experimental” stage and the
benefit to the people cannot be gain
said. Without quoting an array of
figures, the price of gas has been re
duced to the consumer, employes have
received higher wages, and yet mor®
than half the purchase price has al

■well take heart of grace and continue
the good w T ork several of them have
already started.
Eight policemen of Melitopol, Rus
sia, were recently sentenced to six
years penal servitude for beating . a
prisoner to death. It does not seem
that barbarous Russia is as gentle
with her whipping bosses as Georgia
has beta.
Miss Annis Peck has been nearer to
Heaven than any one else has ever
been. She climbed to the summit of
Mount Huascaran, an altitude second
only to Mount Everest, the highest
mountain peak in the world. Miss

Peck is a rather fragile appearing
woman, but it is said that her endur
ance was greater than that of the
tw r o strong mountain guides who ac
companied her on the trip, but who
gave up before reaching the height
she did. She is the first known hu
man being who ever scaled this peak
of perpetual ice and snow.
_ John D. Rockefeller is to write a
confession of “Some of the events
which have made life interesting to
him.” Ma ny a small competitor
whom he has knifed could show how
Rockefeller has made life interesting
for him.
Twenty-four foreign nations and
all the states and dependencies of the
United States in addition to the Fed
eral government, are represented in a
Tuberculosis convention in Washing
ton this week. The most advanced
methods of fighting consumption will
be shown and models exhibited of
dwellings, hospitals, railway and
street cars. Essays will be read and
discussed by such distinguished men
as Doctor Robert Koch of Berlin,
Bang of Copenhagen, Camilo Calle
ja of Valladolid, Spain, T. Ishgami
of Japan and others whose w T ork has
worldwide fame. With such scien
tists interested in combating the dis
ease, we may confidently expect the
“Great White Plague” to lose its
terror.
There is something new for Santa
Claus in the projected establishment
of a factory for Hie manufacture of
negro dolls.
Taft has found it unprofitable and
unexciting to imitate the “front
porch” campaign and is off for the
middle West. %
A student strike has been de
clared throughout Russia, in protest
against the repressive measures re
cently promulgated by the minister
of education. Among other irritat
ing pieces of tyranny, women were
barred from the universities, though
heretofore they had been admitted to
them on the same terms as men. This
was not due to prejudice against the
sex, but a mere recognition of them
as equal lovers of liberty and as it
was impossible to bar all students tiie
minister hit upon this means as cut
ting down the total number of the
student body. Doubtless if he could
close all schools entirely he would
gladly do so, as education in any form
is abhorrent to the government.
