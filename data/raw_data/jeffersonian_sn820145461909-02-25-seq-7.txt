MORE INSIDE INFORMATION
CONCERNING THE SANITA
RIUM AT MILLEDGEVILLE.
Dudley, Ga., Feb. 15, 1909.
Dear Sir: Having seen in the Dub
lin Dispatch that you have been tak
ing considerable interest in the
George Bell case, that gentleman now
being unlawfully held in the Sanita
rium in Milledgeville, and having been
sent there last fall for a severe pain
in the head, I wish to let you know
what I saw while there. I was sent on
the 16th day of November, 1908, and
stayed there until the 31st day of
December, 1908.
I saw one of the attendants jerk
one of the inmates from the table
where he was eating, struck the side
of the table with his head and kicked
him in the side. The man never came
back to the table any more.
I saw an attendant catch an inmate
in the collar and jerk him down flat
of his back, which was enough to kill
him. Another was shoved backwards
down the steps-; another was slammed
against the house and died the next
day. Another was jerked out of a
chair by the hair and jerked all over
the floor several times. Another man
was jerked down; he crawled up to
where the attendants were and was
jerked down agaiiij'he crawled back
again and they caught him by the
shoulders and threw him across the
floor. He fell near where I was sit
ting, and I saw that he was dying. I
went to bed to keep from seeing them
kill him. I heard him fall again. He
was dead next morning.
They would not give me medicine
as directed until I reported them to
the doctor.
If I can be of any service to you
in the Bell case, let me know. I am
ready to serve you.
Fraternally yours,
C. C. Barlow.
TWO VIEWS OF THAT LINCOLN
ARTICLE.
“Many men, many minds.” And
there’s nothing like stirring the men
tal pot. The first of the letters be
low knocks the old man hard, but the
writer (an Illinois man) renews his
subscription. Likes us in spite of all
he can do, you see.
The next letter, from a scion of
Pennsylvania and a descendant of the
great Revolutionary statesman, John
Dickinson, declares that we gave Mr.
Lincoln a just rating,-—“all that was
coming to him.”
Robinson, 111., Jan. 24, 1969.
Inclosed find draft for SI.OO to pay
for the magazine (monthly) another
year.
In your Lincoln article, in some
respects, you missed the mark a
thousand miles, and more than a
thousand years. Did not some one
set a trap and caught you napping?
I believe much better results would
come from a vigorous discussion of
live issues. Government ownership
of public utilities, the abolition of a
metallic redeemer for a legal medium
of exchange, and the rights of man
as advocated and defended by Paine
and Jefferson. Respectfully, D. T.
February 16, 1909.
Dear Sir: I have just read your
January number of the Watson Jef<-
fersoiiian Magazine, and it strikes me
that you have given Lincoln all that
is coming (o him. I notice your re
marks on page eight, especially in
asmuch as I, too, belong to a noted
statesman’s family, John Dickinson,
the founder of “Dickinson College,”
at Carlisle, Pa., and- the author of
“The Farmer's Letters,” and quite
agree with you that Mr. Lincoln was
not to be compared or classed as a
national statesman like Jefferson,
Alexander Hamilton, and I will add,
my great, great grandfather, John
Dickinson. They were men who cre
ated and made fame by their states
manship and ability.
Pardon me for troubling you with
this letter, but after reading your
magazine tonight, thought I would
write you these few lines. Lincoln
was a big and good man; so were
others, and he was no Washington,
either. Yours very truly,
A CORRECTION AS TO GEN.
GRANT.
Marshall, Tex., Feb. 15, 1909.
Editor Weekly Jeffersonian, Thom
son, Ga.:
Having read the article, “Our
Country Boys in the White House.”
The writer states that President U.
S. Grant was born in Georgetown,
Ohio, which is not correct, as it was
Point Pleasant, Clermont county,
Ohio, a small town about 25 miles up
the Ohio river from Cincinnati, Ohio,
and the old house was only a few
rods from the river.
I have been in it many a time when
a small boy. It was owlied by Mike
Hirch, when it was bought by some
society and moved from Point Pleas
ant to some place, I do not remember
where, for its preservation.
Albert Green.
Seattle, Wash., Jan. 29, 1909.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Watson, Ga.:
-Seattle, and the State of Washing
ton, appeals to you on behalf of
Alaska. Alaska is a political orphan,
without a vote in congress or a local
form of government. Your national
legislators control its destinies. Alas
kans can have no laws, no appropria
tions, no political aid or support, save
by and through the men you elect to
congress. In a broad sense of justice,
and in a spirit of enlightened progres
sive business, will you kindly consider
a personal request at this time?
Alaska MUST have a system of
wagon roads. The country’s produc
tion of $20,000,000 virgin gold is an
nually shipped out as it is mined. It
is the cash paid for supplies, machin
ery, clothing, etc., for every cent of it
reaches the markets of the States.
This money remains in the States,
adding to your wealth.
To lessen the cost of production,
open up vast gold fields, which on ac
count of a lack of transportation must
remain idle, yet are known to be
rich, Alaska asks your aid. Write to
your congressman and urge him to
support ‘a measure which will provide
an appropriation of $1,090,000 a year
for four or five years to build a trunk
line system of roads, with branches.
No richer investment will ever be
made by our government than build
ing roads in Alaska, for it means in
stant development. Forty thousand
jpiney’s wpx£ there now; roads will in-
Gt)fc '3kffcrsonlan
crease this number to 100,000 within
a few years. The development which
will follow will open not only the
great placer fields, but copper, coal,
quartz and oil will be opened up for
production. Wagon roads are the
forerunners of railways; railways will
follow a population and such rich re
sources as Alaska possesses. And with
road construction and the opening up
of its valleys the farmer will till the
rich soil of the Northern valleys, for
he will have a market and a means of
reaching it.
With wagon roads, the Alaska
placer output will soon swell from
twenty million dollars annually to
forty or fifty million. America need
have no fear of a money stringency
with such a flow of gold from the
North. It must be conceded that Alas
ka. has the most extensive placer gold
fields in the known world.
Cost of production without roads is
outrageous. It is an economic sin.
Miners pay from SBO to SBOO a ton
for food and supplies in isolated
camps; horse feed costs as much as
S7OO a ton. The roads already built
have helped to reduce this and open
up scattered camps.
The miners in these sparsely settled
districts, with no local government,
with no means of concerted action,
cannot surmount these difficulties un
anded; and so long as their wealth all
comes to the people of the States,
Alaskans arc surely entitled to Fed
eral appropriation to get a trunk wag
on road built.
You MUST help them in their
Titantic struggle.
Alaska trades with the States alone
and exceeds the trade with the Phil
ippines by a million dollars, although
the islands have a population of sev
eral million. It is but a million dol
lars less than the trade with Porto
Rico, which has a million population.
These forty thousand miners in the
North distribute their wealth to every
State in the union; they trade with
gold.
Seattle appeals to the nation on
behalf of Alaska. Ask your congres
sional delegation to hear the voice of
their countrymen in the North, that
band of sturdy Americans who will
win lor you a flood of gold exceeding
that of California, and it was'its gold
fields that made the West.
Yours truly,
George E. Baldwin.

TOM WATSON MELON—72 POUNDS
The best all-round melon grown in
Georgia. It has every good quality of
the famous Georgia Rattlesnake and is
superior to that variety in that it is
almost free from rotten ends. It is a
much better shipping melon, and it is
a much better keeper. It is superior
to the KLECKLEY MELON in that it
grows much larger and has all the
sweetness of that variety.
I have been growing melons for the
market for the past twenty-five years
and have tried all of the varieties
known in Georgia, and have no hesi
tancy in saying that the TOM WAT
SON melon comes nearer meeting
every requirement than any variety I
ever saw. I consider the seed to be
