The Conquest of Mexico.
OIr (city conItenimporaries ihave
overlooked the wlailn point o01
Statesmen should make in urging
the coneuelst of Mexico. So lfar
the question has been argued, aInd
very properly, as far as it goes,
1upon the groundiiii of thIe mere ac
(quii itionl of the rieh' territory- of
that country ; a country abound
ing in agi-icultnial, mu ineral, and
pastoral wealth, for the purpose
of furnishing a peaceable and
stable government to that revoln
tionary and distracted people, and
developing its resources, by influ
sing Anglo Saxon vigor into tihe
blood and business of Mexico.
Such a view we consider as emi
nently proper and philanthropic,
but we would urge that there are
reasons more potent for the con
templated advance uipon Mexico
than those so far tleveloped.
Since Cortez andl his band of
Spaniish niobles and heroes inva
(led the territory anId cilrushed the
power of thle Monteznunas, the
conquest of Mcxic ha.s Ibeen the
drerm of Statesmeu. Aaron IBurr, a
statesmman 'oi wiseo cnd far seeing
for his day, woo the first Ameri
cani who attempted to plant nponm
its soil Anglo-saxon manhlood.
Since his day we have had an
ASntin, a Houston, a Quitman
and a Walker. All these were
urgedl on by ambitious schemes.
None by patriotic motives. Love
of and desire for power and
wealth were thie main-springs to
their desire for the conquest and
annexation of the fertile soil of
ae us Texas, Scott and Taylor
added the territory of New Mexi
co and California. With this, the
conquest has been, from other
and mighitier matters nearer home,
which demandled solutionrr, held in
abeyance.
Mexico anlid its great fertility I
can hardly be described, The I
great mass of its territory consists
of an elevated plateau formed by
an expansion of the Cordilleras,
from which slopes decend to the
Atlantic on the Eost, and the a
Pacitfic on the West. The climate 8
from the rapid differences ofele- a
vation is temperate, and it is one
of the richest and most variedl
zones in the world. All its riches
lie, in a measure, undheveloped ; its
people as a mass are bigoted, in
tolerant, ignlorant, lazy and revo
Intionary, although there are o
many of its best citizens wiho re- d
cognize the deplorable condition 8
of their country, but they are pow
erless to chmeck or eralicate the
evils under which they labor. tI
