REV. S. B. SCtlARL
Severs 1i1:: Connection With H :ly
Trinity Catholic Church.
On Friday morning at 8 o'clock Rev.
S. B. Scharl, pastor of Holy Trinity
Catholic church of this city, celebrated
Mass for the last time at this church,
that day terminating his pastorate here.
He left Friday night for Marshall. Tex.,
to remain a day or two with friends,
from whence he goes to Pennsylvania
to enter a monastery of Capuchin
Monks, of the Franciscan Order, near
Pittsburg.
For eight years Father Scharl was
pastor of Holy Trinity, succeeding the
late Father Gentille. During his pastor
ate the parish has flourished, and his
management of its affairs was always
wise and conservative, and he leaves its
financial affairs in much better condi
tion than he found them.
Who will be his successor is not yet
known, though it is generally under
stood that Father Verstrepen of Mon
roe will be named by the bishop to suc
ceed him. No appointment could give
more satisfaction to the members of
the congregation. Until a successor to
Father Scharl is appointed, one of the
priests from St. John's parish will at
tend to the needs of Holy Trinity's.

,which is now established in the mansion
in which President Davis resided dur
ing the war. They therefore ask the help
of every man, woman and child, in or
der that the entire South may shade in
the honor. The association of the Jeffer

the room owned by each State in the
Southern Confederacy, and will be.rep
resented by a table, bearing its name,

LAST OF THE SlGNERS
A Delegate to the Secession Convention
of 186o Passes Away.
-----41
Baton Rouge Truth, Feb. 28: Mr. Au
gustus Talbot, an old resident of the
town of Plaqucmine. died on Friday last
at the age of 89 years. He was, as the
Iberville South says, the last of the sur
vivors of those who signed the secession
ordinance in I86o, and for so doing was
the victim of hatred on the part of car
pet baggers during reconstruction days.
Until the last few years he took great
interest in public aaffirs and filled many
of the most important positions in his
parish and State.
He came to the bar in 1835, and was
appointed district attorney by Governor
Isaac Johnson. This position he re
signed. In 1852 he was a member of the
consttutional convention that framed the
constitution of that year. In 1852 he was
elected a member of the State Senate,
an' served with distinction during the
four-year term. He was a delegate from
Louisiana to the celebrated Democratic
convention that assembled at Charleston,
S. C., in 186o, which led to a division of
the party on the slavery question. He
was a delegate to the secession conven
tion in 1860, and at intervals presided
over that body. He also served as presi
lent for four years of the school board
under the administration of Governor
McEnery, and his interest in public edu
cation is attested today by several hand
some school houses he had erected.
At the bar he stood upon the highest
round of the ladder. His was an exalted
character, and in this community no one
commanded more.profound respect.
