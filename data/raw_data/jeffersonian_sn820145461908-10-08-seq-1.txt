N the death of Gen. William Phil
lips, of Marietta, on September
o
25, there passed from the counsels of
the State one of Georgia’s noblest
citizens—pre-eminent in war and in
peace, revered and beloved by all.
While born in Asheville, N. C., he
came to Georgia when a little boy,
was educated at our State University
and was a leading member of the
North Georgia bar, a contemporary of
such men as Judge Irwin, Judge Rice
and Hon. Jos. E. Brown in the years
immediately prior to the war.

GEN. WILLIAM. PHILLIPS.
During the struggle of the sixties,
Gen. Phillips—who enlisted at the
first call of his country —commanded
the famous Phillips Legion and was
himself terribly wounded in battle
at Cheat Mountain, Virginia. After
the war, he served his State ably as
a member of the legislature during
several terms and was always fore
most in all patriotic works.
He was a man who never sought
his own selfish interests, but devoted
his life to accomplishing “good re
sults for my state,” and was a loyal
member of the Methodist Church
from his youth up.
We deplore his passing. While he
died “full of years and honors,”
men of his heroic mold are of such
value to humanity and their loss to
the world is so great, it i» hard to
bow in resignation to that Higher
Decree which takes away his vener
ated presence and hushes to silence
the voice we loved to hear.

A Weekly Paper Edited by THOS. E. WA TSON and J. D. WA TSON
By a new rule of the Post Office
Department, the former postal rate
of five cents per ounce on first-class
mail matter from our country to
Great Britain, has been reduced to
the domestic rate of two cents per
ounce. Already the international
mail has showed a tremendous in
crease in volume and it is confidently
expected that the reduction in the
rate will be amply compensated by
the greater amount of mail handled.
A reciprocal rate with Germany is
also desired, but will hardly be
effected very soon, as the Fatherland
is so crushed with debt that it fears
to let go any source of revenue and
will therefore maintain the present
postal rates rather than trust to
making up the deficit from reduc
tion in postage, by an increase in
business.
Philadelphia is this week celebrat
ing her 225th birthday. Various
magnificent parades and displays
have been planned, and great histor
ical events will be depicted by means
of beautiful floats in a pageant which
will wind through the old streets on
Friday. All America feels an inter
est in the occasion.
Os vast importance is the Louisi
ana law which removes Sir Robin
Redbreast from the list of game
birds. Last year over a million of
these beautiful and useful little crea
tures were slaughtered in that State,
and probably an equal number in
other Southern states, with the ex
ception of Texas and Alabama, which
have already legal enactments for
the protection of these birds.
The wanton stupid destruction of
the farmers’ best friend is a piece
of sheer depravity which not only
brutalizes the so-called “sports
man,” but works incalculable in
jury to the crops. Insect pests
are constantly increasing, meaning
actual commercial losses of millions
of dollars per annum through their
ravages on vegetation, while the
birds, which are a blessing to the
farm, are being ruthlessly exterminat
ed.
The South —natural home of boun
tiful fields and beautiful flowers —
♦
has been grossly negligent about its
birds. By some perverted instincts
of reasoning the “pot-hunter” is
viewed with contempt, while the hun
ter who slays hundreds and thous
ands of birds without even the ex
cuse of wishing them for food, es
capes the condemnation he deserves.
All sentimental considerations aside,
such “sport” is ruinous to the in-

terests of agriculture, and should be
discountenanced both by law and pub
lic opinion.
The National Women’s Trade
Union League recently held its
second Interstate Conference simul
taneously in Boston, New York and
San Francisco. Among the resolu
tions passed are found these two
expressions: “Whereas, long hours
of work and low wages are especially
prejudicial to women workers; and,
Whereas, it is to the best interest of
the community, State and nation,
that women be free, strong, well
nourished and not overworked; there
fore, Resolved, that we urge the
establishment of the eight-hour day
through legislation as well as through
trade organizations. ’ ’
To be “strong, well nourished and
not overworked” are conditions
which the crudest humanity ■would
exact for its beasts of burden; and
for the mothers of citizens ought
surely to be a slight enough demand
on the part of society. But, by this
time ,the Women’s Trade Union has
doubtless perused the recent finding
of the Supreme Court, which sweeps
into the scrap-heap all legislation
tending toward the betterment of
laborers and says that “the State
has no right to limit the hours of
labor. ’ ’
Over a thousand letters and tele
grams reached Count Tolstoy on his
80th birthday, coming from all sorts
and conditions of people and from
all parts of the world. It is said
that communications from the single
taxers of Australia, followers of
Henry George, and from the waiters
of a music hall in Moscow, were
among those which touched the aged
patriot most.
The Interparliamentary Peace Un
ion convened last week in Berlin, and
has been cordially welcomed by
Prince von Buelow. Its purpose is
to further the policy of arbitration
of all international disputes and the
meeting is similar to The Hague
peace conferences. It is a little dis
couraging, however, to trace the in
consistency between such utterances
as this of the prince: “True pa
triotism consists in avoiding conflict
by resisting damaging, unscrupulous
and unhealthy resentments which
often merge into blind hatred and
deceptive ambition,” and the con
duct of his country in selecting the
former French province of Alsace-
Lorraine as the field for the maneu-
versos the German army, which can
do nothing else than stir up in
France, “damaging, unscrupulous
and unhealthy resentments.” The
German government has never hesi
tated to agitate a warlike spirit
its own people whenever they
showed impatience at the burden of
unnecessary taxation, or their prog
ress threatened to wrest some of the
despotic power from the throne.
The cheerful American drummer
who has been trying to capture Great
Britain these several years past is
going to find quite a checkmate to
the game in the British Patent law
which demands that the articles be
duly patented under its laws, and
factories established on its own soil.
The American manufacturer who has
kindly gone abroad reaping commer
cial advantages in England and sell
ing- his product there at less than
he permitted us to get it for here
■will also find himself up against a
little difficulty. The Britisher is as
gleeful as a Britisher could be in
his funereal sort of way. He does
not see why Almost-foods, Near-
Soaps, Pale-Pills-For-Pink-People and
the like should not be grown upon
home soil to his country’s advan
tage.
The venom of the rattlesnake as a
cure for meningitis has been suggest
ed by the experience undergone by a
small boy who was suffering from
the disease, and through accident the
teeth of a dead snake punctured his
skin, whereupon symptoms of rattle
snake poisoning set in, but menin
gitis began to improve. The venom
of serpents has long been known as
a possible curative agent in some of
the deadlier forms of disease. It is
a heroic remedy, but anything which
offers hope in tetanus and other ap
palling conditions is eagerly seized.
Now the oxygen jug is a new one
on us, and the fresh air fiend is likely
to become rampant over the country.
Long had we known that ozone was
highly stimulating, but little we reck
ed that this property was in any
wise a rival of old Bourbon. Let the
anti-prohibitionists breathe deep and
some of their yearnings may be as
suaged.
The State Prison Commission
convened in Atlanta on Monday for
the first time since the lightning
struck the lease system. They are to
thresh out the provisions in the new
law and get the plans in working
, shape.
