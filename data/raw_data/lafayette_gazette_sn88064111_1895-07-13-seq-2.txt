'Tor forty years and more fie da4
my old lady have kept the faith and Ait
the fight as beat we could, ralkitt to"
pether upright
in all the com
mandmenta, so
far as I know."
said Uncle Dan'l
Rutherford to a
erowd of us
boys over at the
Cross Roads one
day. But way
back there in
my gallin days
I was about the
wildest and
\ o most wickedest
buck that ever run a reel or jumped a
jig anywheres in fifty miles around the
old settlement."
iemlll Broke Loose Ia eoeergy.
"It was back yonder in Georgy where
the Rutherford generation of people
come from, you understand, when I
got forever and eternally weaned off
from dancin and drinkin mean whisky.
It was about the time they started up
that quick and devilish old song, which
runs on with a long rigermarole about
'Hell Broke Loose in Georgv.' One
night we got a gang of us boys togeth
er, which you understand and I was
the lead dog of the pack, and we went
off up into the hill country to a break
down dance. The dance went on reg
lar and all right so far as I can now
recollect. But in the main time we
rounded amongst us three or four
quart bottles of white whisky, and nat
urally of course I felt in duty bound to
help the boys tote the stuff. WVhilst
the dance was goin on we would run a
reel and go out and nibble at the bot
tle, and then jump a jig and go out and
take another nibble.
"But it was on our return back home
that night and up there at the ole Wal
lace plantation that the weanin took
place. One of the Wallaeo boys was
in the gang and we stopped over down
at the quarter to have a little fun with
the niggers, you understand, in passin.
We then took and built up a roarin big
fire right out in the middle of the road
and got a whole passle of nigger boys
and gals out there to have another
dance. which was powerful like a gang
of wild youngsters. By this time I had
took on jest a 1-e-e-tle bit more of that
white whiskey than I could tote con
venient, and about the best that I
could do under the surroundin eircum
ference was to take it over in a jam of
the fence, you understand, and lay
down with it. Right then the whole
entire gang struck up on "Hell Broke
Loose in (leorgy." some singin, some
rappi,n some pickin the banjo, some
playin the fiddle, and everybody play
in the devil it seems to me. I never
had heard that infernal song before,
you understand, and I didnt know any
thing for certain. But when the gen
eral music started up with the song a
big fat black gal got out in the open
and went to knockin the backstep and
cuttin the pigeon wing around the fire.
Tarectly I took up a burnin big fool
notion that the words of the song had
come to pass, you understand, and
hell had broke loose in Ge6rgy. and
right there on the Wallace plantation,
at that. Looks to me like I could see
reglar droves of little blue devils comin
up from the regions below and passin
out through the fire. The boys and
gals went right on with the dance, you
understand-never missed a lick nor
jumped a cog--but I could see more
devils than people, and more pitch
forks than fiddles, whilst everything
was keepin time to the fiery music and
the devilish song of "hllell Broke Loose
in Georgy."
"Man sir, it was the most horriblest,
hair-raisin and hobgoblinest sight that
these old eyes were ever wont to see"
and uncle Dan'l had to stop long
enough to catch his breath and go on.
"Sweatsn I'vwrAp'rutlon"
"Better set the backband back a few
links henceforwards. Andy and not run
too deep on white ink," put in 111ev
Scroggins.
"That's what mikes me tell you
what I do. ]Blev, about usin so much
sperits of-cats-a-fightin," says Andy.
"Till yet I have got a dim and
seatterin recollection"-UInele Dan'l
went on-"of sayin to myself. Dan'.
Rutherford, thin moufght be a very
durn good time of year for you to move
your washin out of (;lorgy and go
West. But right then I couldn't go
nowheres. I couldn't even so much
as git up and go on back home. No
finally at last I come to the conclusion
that it hell had broke loose in Georgy
I would have to lay low and let her
break. and what was worse and more
of it, I would have to stay right there
in a jam of the fence on the Wallace
plantation and see the show out.
"From all the general appearments
I reckon I must of went to sleep about
that time. cause the fire went out and
that awful hell-roarin meetin broke up.
When at last I come back to my right
mind it was broad open daylight and
the boys all gone. The weather was
cold as blazins and the frost was on me
like the snow on a trash pile, you un
deastand, but I was still sweaten great
drops of perspiration as big as your fist.
For two or three days after that seems
to like everything I looked at-the peo
ple, the houses, the trees, the garden
palins and the horse-rack-everything
was knockin the backstep or cuttin the
pigeon wing. whilst the words and the
tune of "Hell Broke Loose in Georgy"
was ringing in my ears like the ding
dong-ding of a thousand evenin bells.
And from that time onwards hencefor
wards and forevermore I was weaned
and weaned right from dancin and
drinkin white whisky.
Our Uncle Daniel Rutherford is now
dead and gone, you understand, and I
don't have no doubts in regards to
which way he went. But if I could
lire right on for a hundred years to
come I never would forget that rainy
day over at the Cross Roads, when he
told us boys as to how he felt and the
things he saw the first time he ever
beard the song of "Hell Broke Loose in
Oeorgy."
Am~er t-m t to tb flesme.
It was sormnewheres along about this
time of year. and not so very many
years ageo. A stranger come through
the at~temuo peddtta B sw-fs* -
sea cahae I tiroe good otbhem. yo
mderitarJ, and talked a whole tae
ineasdis big sight with his mouth.
Over at t Cross Roads one Saturs
day eveain the general crowd got to
ginta I their opinions in regards to
ashb nd fisbihi
"I wat btdt aiiih t trip down in
Boiath*6st Georgy last year. said the
htranger," and 1 took a notion that I
would leave the reglar trail and try my
luck at fshin. I went up in the hills
to what they called "Dead Lake," and
which I had heard some marvelsoide
tales about the fish up there. It *6s
a long dty seasdi-; yud iUnderstand; mia
as the attieaknk iri down the fish omle
jsilin into that dead lake till the water
was in a plum work with 'em. But
there was more fish than feed in that
country, and them fish in that lake was
the dadblamdest most hongriest fish
you ever heard tell of I reckon perhaps.
They could smell a bucket of minnows
or a box of Catawba worms a mile
away, and they would flutter out of the'
water and up the banks lookin for feed.
If you want powerful sharp and quick
they would hobble up your bait before
you could so much as wet your hook.
I didn't do any big fishin that day, you
understand, cause it was too infernal
much trouble. I had to go off and hide
behind a tree every time in orderment
to bait my hook."
The whole crowd went off into a big
laugh as if to say they had some doubts
in the ease, and the stranger looked
like he was sorry be had spoke.
"Stand your ground, stranger, dad
blame 'em, stand your ground, put in
Andy Lucas." Don't you back and
don't you budge narry inch. The
truth is mighty and bound to win, and
by gatlins Andy Lucas aint gone no
wheres. Some people jest naturally
don't know nothin for certain about
fish and fishin nohow. But stronger.
hit or miss, wet or dry, by seventeen
devils in one pack I am with you, couse
I have seen fish as was fish myself, you
understand. I recollect one long, hot,
dry summer indurin of the war when
some monstrous big fish quit the river
and used up and down Deer Creek.
One mornin the hands went down into
the swamp lands and found the corn
and cotton all under water. The sky
above was clear as a bell, and the earth
for forty miles around was dry as a
powder keg. We didn't know what in
creation was the matter tall we found a
most bellatious big fish, which had
swum up the creek durin the night till
he got wedged in between the banks.
Naturally of course the creek was
dammed up and the swamp lands over
flowed. We then put the hands to
work with three or four six-mule teams
and pulled the fish out. When we cut
him open, stranger, what do you reck
on we found in that fish ? Man sir, we
found ten acres of burnt woods irelde,
with old chestnut logs layin around
there which would make a hundred
rails to the butt cut. The truth is
mighty and bound to win, stranger,
and"
But by this time the stranger had
mounted his horse, you understand, and
put out in a swingin gallop, whilst
Andy Lucas went up head.
Neither mDrownded" Nor "Losted."
Of all the wonders that I ever yet
have saw, the most strangest thing to
me is to see a yearlin boy pack up a few
duds and run away from home.
One day last week little Jimmv Pick
ens got huffed up about somethin or
other and run away from home. Ilia
home folks didn't know which way he
had went nor where he was headed for,
and naturally of course it brought on a
terrible high wave of confusionment in
the settlement. Some of the women
folks lowed he mought be drownded in
the creek or losted in the woods, but
that didn't sound much like a boy to
me.
In the main time 1 took particlar no
tice that they didn't miss a meal of
victuals nor lose a lick of sleep over at
the Pickens p'ace. and his mother low
ed she reckoned when JTimnmy got good
hongry he would come up. She didn't
give herself no big' worriment in the
case, only when she went to bed at
night she would leave the hack door
open and plenty of cold grub on the
bottom shelf in the Wntry.
So it turned out by-and-by that Mises
Pickens, mother like, was plum right
about it. Late Saturday evenin Jiminv
come up. lie had swung around
through the woods paster, where he
found a little nigger lookin for the
calves, which he sent him to the house
with the followin note to his mother:
"Deere mnw. Pleeze send me a peace
of soape and some old clothes. Also
my old Sunday shoes and a pare of
socks. I have got a hat."
"Yours in Rags and Sorrer."
"JIuM-."
There was one strong winnin pint,
you understand, about little Jimmy
Pickens. Vhen he found out that he
was wigglin off on the wrong road he
come to his senses like the projeckin
son. and then turned around and coine
on back to the old lick log.

FINE FRENCH iREED.
WIy tle xormam Cattls Are very Poep
lar Aereas the Water.
Among the recent notable arrivals at
the port of New York was that of
twelve head of Norman cattle, owned by
Mr. J. B. Guillot. They were at once
taken-as all foreign cattle arriving
there must be, under ezisting laWs- to
the United States tLisarntiile statioil
at Garfield, i. J., where they will kre
main intil they have completed the le
gal detention of ninety days. We
give herewith a very spirited portrait
of the head of this importation, the
bull Lyre d'Or (1057), five years old.
The Norman, although it is one of the
oldest existing races of domesticated
cattle, is very little known in the
United States, but few of them having
ever been imported previous to this re
cent arrival. The leading character
istics of Norman cattle are great size,
with rather coarse bone, long and

forward and downward--long, deep
body, broad hips, short legs, thick and
rather hard skin, well-covered with a
coat of various shades of red, white.
roan and reddish brown in spots, and
brindled streaks. The cows have well
developed milk veins, and large, well
formed udders. It is claimed for them
by Norman farmers that they are the
best dairy -ows in the world, and
they unquestionably hold the lead
ing position among French breeds
of cattle. Twenty-five to thir
ty quarts of milk a day is not
an unusual yield for a Norman cow in
full flush, and is sonletimes consider
ably exceeded, while 6.000 pounds
within a year is not above the average.
It is mainly from their milk that the
famous Camembert and Brie cheeses
are made. The butter, known in Paris
under the trade name of buerre
d'hignjy commands the highest prices
at the semi-weekly auction sales of the
Hlalles Centrales, the great market
place of the French capital. As beef
animals Norman cattle are noted for
early maturity and great weight
rather than large net weight of
dressed carcasses. Cows which have
served their purpose in the dairy are
fattened until they attain weights of
1,200 to 1,500 pounds. Steers at ages of
two and a half to three years weigh
from 1,600 to 2,000 pounds. and there
are authentic records of Norman oxen
which at six years of age weighed
4,1 .' to .4,33. pounds. I his "general
purpose" quality is of great importance
to the small proprietors of France, as
it enables them to turn to profitable
account their ''dowager" cows and
surplus males. The beef is of good
quality, but there is a larger propor
tion of bone and offal than in the
British breeds of beef cattle. They
are heavy eaters and require an abun
dance of nutritious food. The strong
est claim to public favor made in be
half of this breed is on the ground of
its hardiness and freedom from all
tuberculous taint.. In Normandy great
numbers of these cattle are krept in
thriving condition, without shelter,
winter and summer, throughout the
year.-Am eriean Agriculturist.
FEEDING THE CHICKS.
Ilow to Keep Young B)rds Growinlg ad
In Good Ilesllh.
A writer in the New England Home
stead says: To push young chicks along
and keep them iin health, there is
nothing better than boiled eggs mashed
up, shells and all, with two or three
times their bulk of stale bread crumbs
or cracked crumbs thoroughly mixed.
Mix not more than enough for one feed
of this at a time and give them only
what they will eat readily and quickly.
Feed stale bread soaked in milk, either
whole, skimmed or buttermilk after the
milk has been squeezed out by the
hand. ()nly one feed of this should l,e
prepared at a time. as it will sour if
left to standl any length of time. Millet
seed scattered iin the litter about the
broalhouse or tile short grass, plump
whlea t screenlllgs, oa ts and corn ground
together. with an equal quantity of
bran and made into johnny cakes, are
good for the youngsters. After they
get to be three weeks old cracked corn
and whole wheat mnay form a larger
part of their diet, increasing it as they
grow older. Better results are attained
by a judicious alternation of all, day
by day, or feed ,by feed; it keeps the
Sappetite sharp and they are always on
the lookout for tile new surprise at
meal time. ])on't forget thie pure,
clean water: they need that whatever
the feed. If the soil does not Snpply
grit in proper shape and size it should
be furnished them; a dish of charcoal
where they can help themselves, or a
handful in the soft feed four or fivre
times a week. will prevent most of the
ordinary bowel troubles. No tonic or
stimulant should be needed at this age,
but if a brood gets suddenly chilled a
dose of some good condition powder
will help to put them on their feet

LIVE STOCK NOTES.
Or all our meats, mutton is the freest
of disease.
THE quicker the sheep reaches ma
turity the less food it consumes. Early
maturing sheep, therefore, means low
er cost of production.
Ir wool is low in price it will add
something to the profits of sheep hus
bandry. But now, as never before,
mutton is the standby.
TRE cheapest food for hogs that we
can raise is clover or grass, and in corn
we have perhaps the best food for fat
toning that can be found.
THE best thing the sheep breeder
can do is to recognize that conditions
affecting sheep have changed, and pre
pare to conform to them.
As THE American people come to use
their brains more and their muscle
less, fat meat--mutton included--- goes
out of favor. l'eople want flesh and
not fat more snd more. --Frmer:'

As food for poultry nothing is now
prized more highly among progressive
poultrylen than perfeotly fresh mar
ket bones, out up each day. in addition
to the usual food ration. This elegant
food supplies nearly if not every ele
ment of the complete egg, as well as
the formation of bone, muscle and
fetheeas of trowing ehickeni. Pesh
bones ftoth the tiatket dost bdt a tri
fe. They should be obtained fresk
each day. Their value is due to thie
perfectly fresh animal food which they
contain, along with the other elements
not found in sufficilent quantities in
corn and wheat. It has been proved
that green cut bone will often increase
the egg yield from 50 to 100 per dent. It
will also stimulate the fowls during
the moulting period to such an extent
that the fowls do not suffer as former
ly in this trying time. The juices and
gristle in the fresh bone contain, in a
digestible form, large quantities of
nitrogen, which is absolutely demand
ed in forming the new quills and new
feathers. Therefore, in moulting this
nitrogen, when fresh bones are fed, is
drawn from the food given to the fowl
instead of being drawn from the re
serve force of the fowl, which takes
her strength, stops her from laying and
makes her prone to disease. We are
sure that the practical and economical
farmer or poultryman of to-day who
looks well at cost will utilize a mate
rial for poultry which brings in the
end the greatest profit. We have used
the granulated bone and paid a good
price f r it, but by using a bone-cutter
we got meat, gristle, oil, fat, fine bone
and granulated bone, all in one opera
tion. The sharp, hard pieces of bone
act as grit; the fine bone helps to
make the shell, and the other half or
two-thirds of ordinary market bones is
rich, nourishing food, forming the
feathers and flesh of the fowl and the
iOerior of the eggs in abundance. We
advise all of our readers to look care
fully into these new methods of feed
ing as they come up, and understand
them for themselves.-Prairie Farnter.
TO MAKE A BROODER.
If Properly C.onstrected. One Lamp Will
Keep It Comfortable.
Make a box 4x34 feet and 6 inches
high, cover top with boards and bot
tom with zinc, making a box like the
heater of an incubator. Take a piece
of old cloth, some heavy material, and
cut strips 4 inches wide and long
enough to reach all around the 3x4 box
or 14 feet. Tack this cloth around bot
tom edge of the box; it will hang down
4 inches below the box. Cut the cloth

every 4 inches. The box will then be
surrounded with pieces of cloth 4 inches
square. Put a block 4 inches square
under each corner of this box and the
chicks will get in under easily by push
ing between the 4 inch strips of cloth.
Fix one tin pipe, to heat the brooder,
and one lamp will keep the brooder
warm. Place a %-inch escape pipe in
every corner of the brooder to draw
heat over the surface of the zinc
evenly. As a lamp cannot be connected
in the pipe if the brooder is on the
floor, make a table a little larger than
the brooder with legs 6 or 8 inches
high. A board from brooder to the
floor will soon be used by the chicks.
Do not set boards around the brooder
to keep the chicks in. for they will
crowd up in the corners and kill many.
As the chicks grow put higher blocks
under the brooder so they can get un
der but not high enough so they can
get on top of each other. The floor of
the brooder may be covered with saw
dust.-C. W. McQueen, in Farm and

BEES AND BEEHIVES.
Queens Can how Be Sent All Over the
Country by Mall.
The beehive everywhere represented
as the emblem of industry, as for in
stance in pictures on the covers of
savings bank books, is the old-fash
ioned round, sugar-loaf structure made
of twisted straw; but as a matter of
fact there are very few such hives now
in use except in (Germany and Austria,
anti even there the modern hive is tak
ing their places. The modern hive is
made of boards, and is square with
some modifications in shape and style;
it is not nearly so picturesque as the
old-fashioned have.
A gentleman farmer in SNew Jersey
desiring to get two of the old-fashioned
hives to set up on his place commis
sioned a New York dealer in bee
keepers' supplies to buy them. The
denaler communicated with nmany bee
farmers in hissearch. and finally found
one hive on Long Island. The gentle
man had meanwhile found one himself,
so that he had his desire.
IDealers in beekeepers" supplies sell
everything required, including bees in
the season. One can buy a coloapy of
bees or any number of bees, just as he
can dry goods or shoes. Queen bees
are sent from here all over the country.
They are shipped by mail in little
boxes called queen cages. There is in
each cage space for the queen bee and
for a number of worker bees. In one
of the cage is placed a sufficient store
of candy for food to last the bees or
their journey. Queen bees are fre
quently sent from here to Australia it
this manner, and 50 per cent. of them
reach their destination alive after a
journey of forty-five days.-N. Y. Sun.
Overfeedlinag Cnuees Disese.
That fowls have all they will eat is
generally the secret of their sickness
Overeating is a deadly evil, and fowls
arh as greedy as pigs, and will not
stop until the throat is filled to the
month. This, of course, is productive
of disease of some inflammatory char.
acter. The disease described is ery.
sipelas, which consists of inflammation
of the head with swelling and the pro
duction of offensive matter under the
skin. It is useless to fuss with the
tfowls, as, if they can be cured, they
will be worth little after it. The best
way is to kill all the diseased birds
and begin anew, then feed only what
is healthful. Too much wheat is not
good for fowls. The bese food is a
mixture of wheat, comn, chopped cab
blage and boiled or baked potatoes,
given hot in the winter, in the snorning
