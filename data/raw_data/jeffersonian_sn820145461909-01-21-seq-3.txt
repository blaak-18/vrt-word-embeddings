record of our unsuccess m selling
finished cotton products across the
sea. The only foreign customer that
counted at all importantly in the
totals of our export trade was China,
and our market there has pitiably de
clined. England, Germany, and Japan
are forcing our ships from the Pacific,
just as they crowded them off the
paths of the Atlantic. We should be
carrying cargoes of cotton goods to
all ports of the earth. Instead of that
the nations send here for eighty per
cent of there raw supply, manufacture
it into all forms of commodities, out
sell us in all the world’s markets, and
even successfully ship the manufac
tured goods back to the Americans
who produce the raw supply. Switz
erland, for example, which grows no
cotton, whose mountains yield no coal
for its factories, a country that has
not an inch of seacoast or a plank
afloat, sends to us, in the ships of
other nations, more finished cotton
goods than we export to all the coun
tries of Continental Europe combined.
America’s future, when she realizes
her heritage and opportunity in cotton,
will eclipse anything that has been
foretold for this republic. It is only
within the last hundred years that
cotton has conquered the world. The
career of this plant has scarcely be
gun. The remarkable pace in its prog
ress to power is revealed by the
quaint fact that in 1784 eight bags of
American cotton was seized by the
customs authorities at Liverpool, the
sage British verdict being that the
importation was fraudulent, as so
much cotton could not possibly be pro
duced in one year in America! In
Napoleon’s campaigns thousands of
the wounded could have been saved
had there been an adequate supply
of cotton for bandages.
Before Eli Whitney’s time it took
a man in his home two years to sepa
rate one bale of cotton from the seed.
The yield of cotton thus handicap
ped on its way to the wearer was un
important. There had been co*ton
from remote antiquity. The mummies
of Peru were wrapped in it. The an
cient Hindus wove it, and by some
forgotten art the weaving was five
thousand times finer than is to be
found in any of the fabrics of modern
times. Cotton was a sacred thread
among the Brahmans, and the theft of
it a serious crime. In the gardens of
Chinese temples at the present day a
special variety of cotton plant is
found which is nowhere else grown.
From its yield the vestments of the
Confucian prests are made.
Great Britain has made an organ
ized and scientific effort to raisa a
supply that would make her independ
ent of America, for the statesmen of
that empire foresee the possibilities
of the day when America, rising to a
recognition of her right, will manu
facture her own cotton and sell it to
the world. But Great Britain, with
her grip upon all available areas, after
many years of unsuccessful effort, has
had to and must come continually to
America for her supply.
The Standard Oil Company has
made it possible to illumine millions of
homes that otherwise would be in
darkness, but this has been made prac
ticable only through the cot, i»i wick.
When you are born they wrap you in
cotton; when you die they bury you
in a cotton shroud. Throughout life
cotton is most constantly wi.h man.
It is his closest companion by day and
keeps him comfortable at night. Cot
ton is spread upon his tables; it is in
the upholstering of his chairs. If he
takes a ride on the Flying Limited
it is cotton waste in the wheel
boxes, through which lubricating oil
is fed to the running-gear, that in
sures a continuous trip. This is an
electrical age, but without cotton in
sulation on the wires the might of
electricity would be a menace.
Cotton and the Peace of the World.
Cotton has within itself, under the
guiding hand of the country which
produces it, the power to bring about
ultimate world-peace. The United
States, by prohibiting the exportation
of raw cotton cargoes to England,
Germany, France, Italy and Switzer
land, could inflict hopeless industrial
paralysis and financial panic upon
those lands. The balance of power is
in our hands to a most remarkable de
gree, but we treat it with indifference.
One word from America that it
would withhold supplies of cotton
would bring all Europe to terms of
comity.
In the meantime, and until we reach
the realization of the potency of cot
ton, if nations continue to waste their
substance (and their purchasing pow
er) in war, cotton will continue to be
found indispensable in conflict. It is
guncotton that hurls destruction
through the ranks, and it is cotton
that binds up the wounds of the fall
en. The Japanese in their recent war,
through an unrivalled system of sur
gery and hospital service, reduced the
death rate of the wounded to an un
precedented minimum. Without cot
ton that would have been impossible.
And it is in cotton khaki that the
armies march. And they make their
bivouacs under cotton tents.
Cotton is indeed first in war, as it
is first in peace!
Now we are entering this new age,
the age of aerial flight, and the aero
plane is a cotton chariot! On these
wings of cotton we have begun to fly
through the heavens at thirty and
forty miles an hour, and the end is
not yet.
It is easy to forget, at least to fail
to keep in mind, that cotton cloth, the
cloth of the civilized masses, without
which they would become barbarians,
is the product of a plant. Cloth grown
from the soil! If by some botanical
necromancy we could grow finished
garments in the field, and if these gar
ments could be produced in like quan
tities in no other part of the earth,
every man would instantly realize
that America possessed a monopoly
which would make all other nations
our petitioners. Yet we have that
monopoly as assured as it would be if
we harvested clothing ready to wear,
for if we ourselves produced the gar
ments that we by our toil in the
South enable Europe and Japan to
manufacture, we would possess almost
an exclusive supply of the cloth and
clothing already needed by at least
one-half of the human race.
Men cannot, if they would, again
depend for their clothing upon the
skins of wild animals. These beasts
have practically vanished. Nor is
Jeffersonian
there enough wilderness on the globe
to furnish a range for the rearing of
sufficient animals to provide garments
of skins for mankind. The world of
men and women is clothed today as
never before. It is only within the
last century, with cotton within the
reach of the multitude, that the ma
jority have been adequately clothed.
The heroes of the Revolution were
half clad and that half was rags.
And it is one of the interesting iron
ies of history that during that period,
when the problem of clothes was su
preme, both in America and abroad,
Richard Arkwright, who invented the
spinning frame, and James Har
greaves, who invented the spinning
jenny, creations which were to
change the history of the race, had
their machines destroyed by the en
raged and half-clad populace, who
feared the competition of these labor
saving devices.
Our New Destiny.
We smile at the short-sighted folly
of that day, and yet the progress in
the use and manufacture of cotton
will be as tremendous in the coming
years as in the past. There is an
actual kingship for cotton, not only
commercially, but politically; and this
sovereignty of cotton in America I be
lieve to be at hand.
We shall awake to our new destiny
as a world-power and trading nation
when we realize fully that the South
ern section of our Republic is virtual
ly the exclusive source of a commod
ity absolutely indispensable to the
myriads of mankind from New York
to Shanghai, from Nome to Monte
video, from London to the Cape. Less
than one and a quarter million Ameri
cans, in fourteen states of this
Union, hold in their hands the com
fort, the luxury, the destiny of mAi
kind.
An enormous profit is made some
where in the progress of cotton to the
consumer. Every year cotton goods
to the value of nearly six billion dol
lars are turned out from the 125,000,-
000 spindles in the world. But the
poor farmer in the cotton fields sees
but a pitiful part of the multiplying
fortunes attending the migTation of
cotton goods around the earth. The
Southerner sells raw cotton to Japan,
and the mills at Osaka turn out prod
ucts that outsell our goods in Shang
hai and Canton; and the Japanese cot
ton manufacturer, traveling in state to
America, may wonder wherein the
half-fed Southern farmer—a vassal
tenant —following his one mule in the
furrow, has advanced in civilization
over the only recently awakened pa
gan of the East.
The ordinary grower of cotton cul
tivates twenty acres, producing one
half a bale to the acre. Unfortunate
ly, in too great a majority of cases
he is a tenant farmer. Os his ten
bales, the result of his year’s toil, five
must go to the owner of the land.
The working farmer, for his product,
gets, we will say, ten cents a pound
or fifty dollars a bale, his twelve
months of effort and expense bringing
him in a gross revenue of two hundred
and fifty dollars. This is an insigni
ficant total for the man who among
others produces the commodity that
controls the world.
