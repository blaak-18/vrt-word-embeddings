not given it vory much attention, and
while we had satisfierl ourselves that it

idea of its real value. From direct
evidence we can affirm to any one in

He Knows It All.
The nimn who thinks a L"protect

nancial and economic ills, knows it
all.

that "overp,roductiou" is the cause
of low prices, and that because
there is such an abulndance of food
and clothing the xpoor in our cities
•are going in hunger and naked
less.
lie is the same man who "knows',
that a "gold standard" and less
money will bring "prosperity."
He is positively certain that God
made money, and that a national
debt and bonds are a national bless
ing.
lie is the same man who knows
that laborers would all starve were
there no "capitalists" to "employ"
them.
lie refuses to read anything but
his old party paper, and don't read
much of that.
He never thinks, but can tell you
just how the calf got through the
knot-hole in the fence and then
stuck fast by the tail.
He is in for "Patriotism, protec
tion and prosperity," though he
can't tell you what they mean, but
knows they are "something good
to eat."
He can he depended on to vote
his old party ticket "straight."
Let him alone. You can't reach
him, for he only feels through his
stomach, and carries his brains in
the seat of his pants,
Who invented the bicycle ? The
answer seems as far off as the mil
lennium, notwithstanding all the
delving into the history of past in
ventions. The latest discovery
and one which takes the date much
further back than any yet advanced
by the curious in such matters
proves that a "pedomobile"-what
a name for a wheel !-was invented
by one Dr. Richard, a physician,
in 1690. If things go on as they
have been doing of late, I expect
to hear that Noah took a bicycle
into the ark with him, and that le
was fond of "ooasting" clown the
slopes of Mount Ararat.
Chicago detectives are on the
lookout for a petrified man. An
Iowa farmer, some time ago lost a
stone man and is on the hunt for
it. He is willing to pay $1f') for
the petrified man and half as much
for the capture of the unconscion
able person who stole him. Chief
of Police P. Johnson, of Des
Moines, sends out this description
of the petrified man: "He is 5
feet 8 1-9 inches tall and weighs
825 pounds. His right leg has
been cut of at the knee, and on the
little Boger of the left hand there
is a gold riag." This is a hard

harrows with earth, and put them

The gold standsrd fellows of the
eest are going to vote the same
ticket this year. They have too
muc sense to divide over party
names d ight each other. If the
silver men fail to adopt the same
course it will be because some of
them think more of party than they
do of p iple.--Clay Center, Ky.
