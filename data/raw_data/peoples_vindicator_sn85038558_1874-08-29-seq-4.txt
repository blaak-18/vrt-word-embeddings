. KIA HAIR
Every year increases the populari
ty of this valuable Hair Preparation;
which is due to merit alone. We
can assure our old patrons that it is
kept fully up to its high standard;
and it is the only reliable and perfect.
ed preparation for restoring GRAY
OR FADED HAIR to its youthful color,
making it soft, lustrous, and silken.
The scalp, by its use, becomes white
and clean. It removes all eruptions
and dandruff, and, by its tonic prop
erties, prevents the hair from falling
out, as it stimulates and nourishes
the bair-glands. By its use, the hair
grows thicker and stronger.o In
baldness, it restores the capillary
glands to their normal vigor, and
will create a new growth, except in
extreme old age. It is the most eco
nomical IAni DRESSING ever used,
as it requires fewer applications,
and give the hair a splendid, glossy
appeara ce. A. A. Hayes, M.D.,
State Asiayer of Massachusetts, says,
"The constituents are pure, and care
fully selected for excellent quality;
and I consider it the BEST PIIEPA
RATION for its intended purposes."

Per Diseases of the Throat and Lungse
sueh as Coughs, Colds, Whooping-.
Cough, Bronchitis, Asthma
and Consumption.
AmonF the great
discovcres of iAod
rn science, few are
of more real value
to mankind than
this effectual rem
edv for all diseases
of the Throat and
Lungs. A vast tri.
al of its virtues,
throughout this and
other countries, h1:1s
shown that it does
surely and effectually control them. The tes
timony of our best citizens, of all classes, es
tablishes the fact, that CuitYuv PFECTORAL
will and does relieve and cure the atflicting
disorders of the Throat and Lungs beyond any
other medicine. The most dangerous narec
lions of the Pl'lmonarv Organs yield to its
power; and cases of (onsauml on, curet
by this preparation, are publicly known, so
remarkable as hardly to be believed, were
they not proven beyond dispute. As a rem
cd! it is adequate, on which the public may
rey for full protection. By ecring Coughs,
the forerunners of more serious disease, it
saves unnumbered lives, and an amount of
suffering not to he compauted. It challenges
trial, and convinces the most sceptical.
Every family should keep it on hand as a
protection against the early and unperceived
attacks of Pulmonary Afections, which are
easily met at first, but which become incoura
ble, and too often fatal, if neglected. Tender
lungs nced this defence; and it is unwise to
be without it. As a safeguard to children,
amid the distressing diseases which beset the
Throat and Chest of childhood, CnRbt r
PEcrorAL is invaluable; for, by its timely
ase, multitudes are roescued from premature
graves, and saved to the love and affection
centred on them. It acts speedily and surely
against ordinary colds, secnring sound annd
health-restoring sleep. No one will suffer
troublesome Ilduensa and painful Braon
eit1s, when they know how easily they can
be cured.
Originally the prduct of long, laborious,
and successful chemical investigation, no cost
or toil i spared in making every bottle in the
utmost possible perfection. It may be coni
dently relied upon as possessing all thie viF
tes It has ever exhibited and capable of
plroducing ees as memrabl as the sgbatst
it has ever effected.

Grateful Thousands proclaim
VINEGAR BITTEIRS the most wonder
ful Invigorant that ever sustained
the sinking system.
No Person can take these Bit
ters according to directions, and re
main long unwell, provided their
bones are not destroyed by mineral
poison or other means, and vital or
gans wasted beyond repair.
Bilious, etemittent, and In
ternmittent Fevers, which are so
prevalent in the valleys of our great
rivers throughout the United States,
especially those of the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, Arkansas, Red, Colo
rado, Brazos, Rio Grando, Pearl,
Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
.heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdomuinal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous org;ns, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to DR. J. WALKER'S VINEGAR
BITTERs, as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy f'uc
tions of the digestive organs.
Fortify the body against dis
ease by purifying all its fluids with
VINEGAR BITTERS. No epidemic can
take hold of a system thus fore-armed.

Eructations of the Stomach, Bad Taste

Lungs, Pain in the region of the Kidneys,
and a hundred other painful symptoms,
are the offspringsof Dyspepsia. One bot

merits than a lengthy advertisement.

Swellings, Ulcers, Erysipelas, Swelled
Neck, Goitre, Scrofulous Inflammations,
Indolent Inflammations, Mercurial affec
tions, Old Sores, Eruptions of the Skin,
Sure Eyes, etc. In these, as in all other
constitutional Diseases, WALKERa's VI
EOGAR BITTERS have shown their great cur
ative powers in the most obstinate and
intractable eases.
For Inflammatory and Chronic
Rheumatism, Gout, Bilious, Remit
tent and Intermittent Fevers, Diseases
of the Blood, Liver, Kidneysand Bladder,
these Bitters have no equal. Such Dis
eases are caused by Vitiated Blood.
Mechanieal Diseases.-Persons
engaged in Paints and Minerals, such as
Plumbers, Type-setters, Gold-beaters and
Miners, as they advance in life, are sub.
ject to paralysis of the Bowels. To guard
against this, take a dose of WALrUK's

Skin, Humors and Diseases of the Skin of
whatever name or nature, are literally
dug up and carried out of the system in a
short time by the use of these Bitters.
Pn, Tape, and other Worms,
larking in the system of so many thoua
sands, are effectually destroyed and re
moved. No system of medicine, no ver
mifuges, no anthelmiaities will free the
system from worms like these Bitters.
F'orFemale Comnplaints,in young
or old, manrried or single, at the dawn of
womanhood, orthe turn of life, these Ton
ic Bitters display so decided an influnence
that improvement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
whenever you find its impurities barsting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores; cleanse it when you find it ob
strueted and sluggish in the veins; cleanse
it when it is foul; your feelings will tell
you when. Keep the blood pure, and the
health of the s.vstem will follow.
