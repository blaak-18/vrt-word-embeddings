TIlE POOR MAN "RACKET."
The poor man "racket" is another plea
of the long and untiring feeders in oppo
sition to nominations by primary elec
tions. The long feeders favor the "cut
and dried" convention system because it
can he manipulated to meet their aims
and p.orp;oses. A primary is more or less
embarrassing a:d uncertain in its con
clusiveness and results. The advocates of
the old convention system pretend sin
cerity when they allege that no poor man
can be a candidate for any State office
and win in a primary unless he has at
his hands a barrel of money. But what
is the poor man's opportunity in a con
vention which is stocked against him?
It has been developed in Mississippi that
the primary system is not more expen
sive to the candidate, say for governor,
than the convention, and one of the ad
vantages of the primary is that every
poor man entitled to vote may cast his
ballot directly for the candidate of his
choice. How many poor men can afford
the luxury of a trip to the convention at
a cost of from $30 to $5o? Having been
complimented as a delegate, and being
unable to spend the money necessary for
the trip, the poor man remains at home
and the delegates attending, as a rule,
vote as a unit and in some instances that
unit has been one or two officeholders
who could enjoy the luxury and who,
having some direct interest in view, can
be easily persuaded to "throw" their
influence to the man whose nomination
gives assurance of good practical results
for them and their friends. As a conse
quence the convention is manipulated in
keeping with the "cut and dried" pro
gram in which the poor man at best cuts
a sorry figure.. Seriously considered, the
poor. man's play and opportunity is strict
ly in the nomination of governor and all
'State and local officers through primary
elections-where the poor man's vote will
count and be of equal vaplue 'as the vote
of the man who rolls in wealth or is pos
sessed of the most lucrative public office.
A convention, as a rule, with rare excep
tion, is simply the expression- of a few
men, crncerned in a select -few, but the
c ipessie. of the majority at a primary
election fairly ani honestly conducted
41icttt will of the people. at least the
' ,sothy majority of the Democrats:
OPPOlNENTSOF PRIMARIES.
.The I ame Guardian-Journal says:
d'T ¶wouents of nominating by pri
nis, 'Mlike the opponents of divesting
the governor's office of its vast and ex
tensive patrotnage, consist largely of a
compact and well oaranized force and is

stand Dewey has not only added luster
to his name. but he has fortified himself
in the esteem of the people. He has not
apologized, he will not apologize. nor
will he be censured or removed by Presi
dent Roosevelt. Dewey is safe in his
mhnliness. and it may be assumed that
the German government will not further
press the incident, but suppose it did.
What then ?
Organization is the first essential to
success. The great majority of the rank
and file of the Democracy in Louisiana,
being opposed to the "cut arrd dried"
convention plan, favor the nomination of
all officers from governor to constable,
by primary elections. But unless they
move in harmony and in unison in the
spirit dictated by honesty and fairness.
their power will be neutralized by the
nmnority.
The reorganizers can not raise enough
dust to prevent the people from seeing
their wig-wag signals to the trusts.

Your Uncle Grover with all his bom

'-Iamnqfication" is too plain and direct.
No deserter from the Democracy to Mc
Kinleyism will be permitted to take the
lead. Is not Cleveland one of the trusted
of the Trusts?
The Homer Guardian-Journal in urg

SDisprove Evidence.
SENSATION PROBABLE
Ban Francisco Call Is Authority For
a Statement That May Prove to
Render Frenchmen's les.
timony Untrue.
San ?ranciso, April 8..-The tall
says startling developments are prom
Ised in the Charles Fair case, now be
fore the New York courts. It is al
leged facts would come to light here
most damaging to the testimony given
a few days ago in New York by Lu
cien Mas and Alfred J. .Morane,French
men,; who were called to recount cer
tain incidents attending the death of
Charles Fair and wife in France.
which, if true, would strongly tend to
establish as a fact that Mrs. Fair sur
vived her husband, and thus left her
own relatives direct heirs to a fortune
inherited under these circumstances to
her husband.
It has been learned, continues the
Call that the skull of the late Mr. and
Mrs. Fair, whose bodies were shipped
back to San Francisco after they had
been relinquished by the French au
thorities, have been reserved. and are
now in the custody rf responsible per
sons here, ready to be produced when
the time comes for refuting evidence
given at New York. Whether they
will be sent to New York or remain
here is a matter that is wholly depend
ent upon a move that is to be shortly
undertaken to have the case transfer
red to the courts of this city.
When the bodies of the Fairs wer
received in New York from France
they were discovered to be in such a
decomposed condition that it was
deemed advisable to hasten the fune
ral in San Francisco. It is stated that
the funeral was followed by an autopsy
that included decapitation of both
bodies, an operation that was made by
Drs. Galaway and Robinson. The tes
timony of Mas and Morane that Mrs.
Fair was living when they approached
the bodies and blood was streaming
down one side of her fate is contradi.
ted by the concrete evidence of the
woman's skull. It can be shown by the
skull that such would have been im
possible, it is claimed. The skull of
Charles Fair is now in the safe keep
ing of his friends, but not crushed in
the manner described my the Freno('
witnesses. In fact, it remains intact.

Went Through Unanimously.
Dublin, April 18.-The national con
vention caled by the United _1ist
league to consider the new land bill
continued its business. There was a
small attendance. In view of a mis
understanding in the case of certain
English papers, John Redmond. chair
man, introduced a strong home rule
resolution, declaring that the Irish na
tion would never be satisfied until it
obtained the full measure of self-gov
ernment. "No substitute," said Mr.
Redmond, "can or will be accepted."
Mr. Michael Davitt briefly seconded
the resolution, saying Irishmen would
be neglecting their sacred duty to the
cause if they did not send such meas
ure to their race throughout the world.
Mr. Redmond's recommendation was
carried by acclamation.
. Wililam O'Brien then proceeded to
explain varionu suggested amendments
to the land bill. An amendment of
Mr. O'Brien, providing for extending
