The Gazette votes aye on the
proposition of the Shreveport

Eureka Springs.
Bro. Hicks does not seem to like
the idea of making political

the Sunday paper; are you opposed
to it, too?

The Times-Democrat does not

in Louisiana.
Two Frenchmen fought a duel
near Paris a few days ago, and one

The Lake Charles Commercial t
was sixteen years of age last Satur
day. The Commercial was founded I
by the late John McCormick, one C
of the biggest-hearted men that ever a
lived. The Gazette wishes the a
staunch old sheet the full measure
of prosperity that it so justly
merits.
There are people who are fond of
finding mistakes in the news
papers. These supercilious folks i
are generally oblivious of their own
errors. They labor under the delu
sion that it is just a matter of im- a
possibility for them to be guilty of
writing an ungrammatical sentence.
Doctors, lawyers and even school ]
teachers sometimes make mistakes, t
and why shouldn't the newspaper
man ?
The question of the imprisonment
of the broker, Chapman, and thea
release of Havemeyer, when sim
mered down, is simply this: The
head of a great trust is bigger than
the Supreme Court and the United
States Senate combined, but a
broker is not. And here is afforded
an object lesson to the youth of t
America, which teaches that if he t
wants to be a big man he must be
come the head of a great trust and I
not enter the brokerage business.
Daily States.
What as needed now is an author- c
itative court ruling, stating just a
bow much money a man must bet
worth to eatirely escape punish- I
-ment at the hands of the courts; 1
just how much he must be worth to t
get a jail sentence that carries with a
it all the comforts of a good hotel, a
and just how little he must be
worth in order lo be treated like a
common feloa. When this ruling
is handed down we wil know justt
who does and who does not belongI
to the ooLdern privileged classes.

TI7E NEW GOSPEL.
About the most pusilanimous ar
V gnment offered in defense of Gov
ernor McEnery's vote for the
e. Dingley bill is the one advanced by
certain weak-kneed newspapers that
because the Republicans are in
power and are sure to pass their
bill, it is unwise to oppose them.
- Such opposition, they declare, can
do no good as the Democrats are
in a hopeless minority and conse
r quently are not in a position to de
r feat any measure which the major
r ity will support.
Other editors cooly inform the
people that it is the duty of our
national representatives to join the
majority because in this manner
they will have a better chance to
share in the booty of the tariff rob
bers who are now scheming and
planning how to more- thoroughly 1
1 fleece the American consumer.
t There may be some justification I
I for Gov. McEnery's vote. It may i
based upon wisdom and justice. It
1 may be, though we believe it not,
r that the senator is consistent and
I that we should praise and not cen- j
, sue him.
I But for men to assume the posi- 1
I tion that because the Democrats
are in a minority they should
quietly and uncomplainingly sub- t
mit to, and even aid in, the perpe
tration of a great wrong upon the c
people, is profoundly demoralizing, t
palpably discreditable and devoid c
of either reason or justice.
Some of the "high-tariff Demo- I
cratic editors" were in many cases
the most intemperate howlers <
against the trusts during the last
campaign. To-day protection can 8
not be piled too high to suit their c
ultra-protective views. They have 3
forgotten, or rather affect to have
forgotten, that not long ago they <
denounced a high tariff as the 4
breeder of trusts and monopolies, I
and the parent of plutocracy, and i
that they could not in their well- r
stocked vocabulary find adequate I
terms to express the contempt in
which they held the party that was C
pledged to the perpetuation of a ]
doctrine so dangerous to our liber
ties.
Is it the prospects of some pap c
that caused our esteemed con- ,
temporaries to change their tariff u
tune with such indecent sudden
ness ?
Has it come to this that plat
forms are made simply to deceive, a
or, in the language of the streets, d
to catch suckers ? b
Are congressmen sent to Wash
ington to legislate for the people ?
Or are they sent there to see how
much of the pelf is due their con
stituents ?
BUSINESS AND TIE Z
TARIFF.
Daily Picayune.
The Senate is now working earn- 1
estly to get through with the tariff
bill at the earliest possible moment.
Since the sugar schedule was dis
posed of rapid piogress has been
made, and it is now probable that A
another week will see the bill in a
position to go back to the House of I
Representatives for concurrence in
the amendments.
Although some changes may yet 1
be made in the tariff bill the gen
eral character of the measure is now C
as good as settled, and business
men are able to make their calcula
tions with more certainty. Never
theless, the termination of the long i
drawn out debate is anxiously a
awaited.
Whatever the ultimate effect of '
the Dingley bill may prove it is cer
tain that there will be a revival of t
business as soon as it becomes s
law, if for no other reason,
at least because of the relief a
felt after the long suspense. f
Owing to uncertainty as to the a
changes to be made Ih the duties t
merchants have restricted their
trading to the smallest possiblet
limits. With the passage of the I
bill things will promptly adjust
themselves to the new conditions,
and the wheels of commerce will
resume theii normal motion.
The very fact that trade has lan- (
guished for so long is sure to lead
to considerable activity as soon as
the pressure which has restricted
its movements is removed. Al- i
ready some lines of business are
showing improvemeat, notably the
iron and dry goods trades These
industries generally lead W every
improvement, and the fact that
they are-now more active is an ex
cellent promise that a general bet
s terment in business affairs is im
z pending.
r RAILROAD RA TES HERE
AJVD ABROAD.
1 Times-Democrat.
While the watering of stock of
railroads, their peculiar financial
management and the fact that they
are so frequently in the hands of
receivers have caused some popular
prejudice. Americans should not
lose sight of the fact that in cost
and comfort they enjoy railroad ad
vantages impossible to the great
majority of Europeans.
Very few Americans know how
I much cheaper railroad travel and
transportation are in this country
than in Europe. The following
table may give some idea of the
relative prices:
For Freight
passen- per ton
ger mile. per mile.
Gents. Cents.
United States....... ......2.14 0.97
Prussia ......... . ............. 2.99 1.32
Austria ....... ......... --..---.3.o5 1.56
France....................... 3.36 1.59
Belgium ..........................2.25 1.50
The United States, it will be seen
is much the cheapest country in
the matter of the carriage of
passengers and the transportation
of freight; and, moreover, the
tendency of rates here is decidedly
downward. Between 1858 and
1896 the cost of transporting zoo
pounds of grains from Buffalo to
New York fell from 70 cents to 9
cents, or 87 per cent, and these low
rates have been achieved without
any reductions in wages, for we pay
our railroad employees handsomely
judged by the standard abroad.
The average pay for locomotive
engineers in the United States is
$3.65 per day against $1.25 to $i.
87 in England, Sx to $1. 6 in
France, 8z cents to $1.25 in Ger
many, and 8x to 9z cents in Bel
gium. It is well to keep these facts
in view when dealing in popular
criticism of the railroads.
The Prince of Wales at Short
Range.
George V. Smalley will contribute an
article on "*The Personal Side of the Prince
of \Vales" to the July Ladies' Home Jour
nal. It is said that Mr. Smalley gives a
uniquely interesting, close view of the
Prince, touching in detail upon his great
personal popularity in England and the 1
reasons therefor, his love of sports, his t
pastimes, his social duties and diversions,
and showing him as an affectionate son, a
devoted husband, a loving father and
brother.
Gentle Eve, of The Times-Democrat,
gives us this bit of slangological gymnastics:
A Boston Purist Speaks.
I don't like slang; it makes me tired,
In fact, it gives me a pain;
I'd like to see all geezers fired
WVho can't speak English plain;
They're always talking through their hat,
Until I don't know where I'm at,
And want to get a gun.
There was a duck whose name was Jim,
He thought he'd made a hit,
I didn't do a thing'to him
Say, he was in it-nit !
'Your talk," I said, "is simply punk,
You'll win une-I don't think."
And so, instead of being hunk,
lie got the rinky-dink.
I must say men have got their nerves
To sling slang as they do;
You bet I'm on to all their curves,
And faze them p. d. q.
The frozen face and marbel heart
Are what they get here, see ?
Of course they think I'm pretty tart,
But slang don't go with me !
