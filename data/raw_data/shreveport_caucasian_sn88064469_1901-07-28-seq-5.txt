bev to Keep the House Cool
'"Many things can be done to mate even
the mall house a comfortable, restful
/ place in hot weather," writes Maria
?arles, in The Ladies' Homi Journal for
August. "Of course the windows must be
properly shaded with blinds or awninzs,
and also well screened. All the heavy
hangings should be removed, and when
pseible the carpets should be taken up or
c .eovered with linen. Cool colors, such as
hite, gray lltht greens and blues, should
take the place of the warmer colors. Thin
white muslin curtains solten the light.
TbS house should be well aired and
sutled at least once a day. The early
4'orrring is best for this. Open all the
windows and blinds and let the sun and
air pour tbrough the house. About nine
o'elook close all the blinds and all th,
windows except one or two downstairs
and two or three Upstairs. In the open
windows place wet grass screens, or cover
the regular screens with wet fisnne'.
When the sun goes down open all the
windows and blinds. A skylight or win
<1ew should be kept open night and day in
the attic, except, of courie, when it rains.
The cellar windows should be open only
at night. If they are not clesed during the
beat of the day the w arm, moisture-laden
air renters the oellar ant cendenses on
walls, pipes, metals, etc, and In a few days
F will make it to damp as to be as unseltt
ble place for keeping food."

STYLES AT NEWPORT. 1
Some Fashionable Costumes Seen 61
the 5niumer Resort.
[Special Corre-pondence 1
N wronT. It. I.. July 22.-Why is it
that a chaperon wears dark or all black
clothes, and why does the inj red inno
icole in a play wear gray, and why
does the very wh ked woman with a@
past wear red? It is to me a proof that
our way of dreysin, indicates mucht
more of our own charact r than w@
think when pch things as I have cited
prove so clearly the dramatic possibili
ties. Effect is the one thing sought for
on the stage, and women off it uncon
sciously adopt the same idea, and so
the chaperon sits demurely on the wide
piazza at Newport and letgIher young
charge do as she likes, only so that no
one sees it, and she wears a black
gown and is invulnerable as a chaperon
and a wise one. The promenade gives
her a chance to wear another gown, but
it must Le a fashionable and a hand
some one. Such gown is seen on the
sands of Newport these days, and It is
a pretty one too. There Is a skirt of
taffeta, and this is covered with one of
the firm Iron frame grenadines, sheer
and fine. At the bottom the grenadine
Is slashed to within ten Inches of the
bottom, and In the slashes are fans
made of three flounces of chiffon. And
there is a flounce at the bottom of the
taffeta skirt with three narrow ruffles
to make It stand out. The waist is very
odd, but pretty. The upper part is of
the grenadine over the taffeta, and
lines of black velvet ribbon extend
from the neck to the bust line There It
Is cut off by a line of handsome white
lace insertion. This is also put around
the neck in shape of a sailor c, Ilar, and
two rows go across the upper part of
the sleeves. The grenadine In front
pouches out in two deep folds. The rest
of the waist is of taffeta covered flat
with grenadine. The sleeves are of taf
feta only save at the top, where the vel
vet is applIed.
One of the new girdle belts is worn
with this, and as this special kind of
belt can be worn with many other
things it behooves me to describe it. In
front it Is curved at the top and point
ed at the bottom, and in the back it is
deeply pointed top and bottom in a
graceful curve. At the back is a chop
of silk, with two ends which are gather
ed to a bunch and finished with a lot of
loops. The hat to wear with this cos
tume should be of a modest but elegant
sort, and that is just what this Is. The
frame is of black lace straw trimmed
with black velvet ribbon and white
chiffon bows and a little lace among the
bows. A parasol should be black, with
white lace insertion and full ruffles of
black chiffof. It is understood that to
be a chaperon to a rich and lovely
young girl does not mean that this pow
erful lady should be a sort of cross be
tween a dragon and a governess, for
any young married lady can now take
a small dozen girls under her wing, the
only sop thrown to Cerberns being that
the chaperon must wear very sober
clothes.
A fetching suit for one of the buds is
made of cream white clairette, which

eol, too, and deliciously delicate to the
ouch. Well, this dress has a skirt
'lain around the bottom save for little
oiata at each seam, where a narrow
lip of black velvet is set, outlined with
strap of white stitched many times
rith black. This is done in the sadie
canner that the sleeves are and can be

The latest and most sentimental fad
we have ever had in jewelry Is the
Douglas heart. It is a locket. The re

of red enamel. In tbe center are a dia

Douglas heart is made to be graceful
rather than conventional in form.
Around the edge is an incrustation of
pure white diamonds set in burnished
silver. Nothing could be more fascinat
Ing even aside from the romantic Enter
est given by the name, for Douglas is
a nanme to conjure by. It is to be worn
as a pendant to a long chain or as a
pin. In every way It is desirable, and

bats our girls
are wearing

THE DOUGLAS HEART. n y m ph. and
dryads some of them look like In
these days. The mass of drooping
lace and flowers makes a face so
poetic and so entrancing that it is
really hard to believe some of the mil
linery is made by human hands. Just
cast a glance at the poetic dream in the
illustration and see what a dainty thing
can be evolved out of flowers made of
scraps of cloth with a liberal allowance
of glue and things. The hat is of rough
straw, and it is fairly smothered in
lace and chiffon ruffles, with pink roses
and their foliage put all around. The'
flowers are the pretty prairie roses
with their ever changing shades. In
one bunch one may find a round dozen
shades, from palest pink to deep crim
son. The foliage is smooth and also
shaded according to the age of the
branch. The prairie rose has no per
fume, but it lends itself admirably to
reproduction for millinery purposes.
The boa Is made of chiffon, the part
around the neck covered with picayune
roses, also In pink. The long ends have,
ruffles, and these have a few small
roses set along the edge. The whole
effect is exquisite, and the girl who
wears such a creation can well be de
scribed as queen rose in the rosebud
garden of girls. Who cares how much
such a hat and boa cost when the re
sult Is before us so perfect and so
adorable?
Now, there are faces which show
best under the hat just mentioned, but
there are others which look arch and
provoking under the saucy tricosne
toque. A psetty one which I saw re
cently was of pale blue faicy sjraw,
wttL the left side laced up wrth black
velvet ribbon, ending in a few loops.
The crown held a big bunch of deep
blue plums with their foliage. Some qi
the branches fell over the brim in front
so as to hang temptingly at the left
side. For a brunette, who wore it, this
was an ideal hat, though I do lot ad
vocate fruit as a general rule as a
trimming for hats.
All these hats are for the proper sub
jugation of helpless mankind when all
ether blandishments fail-blandish
ments in the shape of sailor, golfing
and bicycling hats and other mannish
contrivances. The tulle and chiffon

The New
Woman
By ELIZA
RCIIARD CONNER . -
Mrs. Katharine Swan, a young col
lege woman, has originated a pleasant
occupation for a limited number of
her sex. For several years she was a
successful newspaper writer; then she
turned to another field, which suited
her better. First, she took lessons in
scientific cookery. Being an educated
woman, it was easy for her to master
culinary matters. In thousands of
homes in all the large cities gas is
now used instead of coal for cooking.
Owing, however, to the ignorance of
the cooks and sometimes of the mis
tress of the house herself the gas range
does not always work satisfactorily.
The range is blamed instead of the
mismanagement of it, and the next
thing that is said is that gas is no good
for cooking, and its use as fuel is aban
doned. This of course works to the in
jury of the gas companies. In one of
the largest eastern cities a gas com
pany employs Mrs. Swan to go to the
houses in which the range does not
give satisfaction to adjust it and to
show the cook how to use it In the
most economical manner. Incidentally,
too, Mrs. Swan gives a cooking lesson
to illustrate her methods. She is ex
tremely tactful and is careful to give
no offense through assumption of su
perior culinary knowledge. She has
learned thoroughly the mechanism of
gas stoves, and if one is really out of
order she can clap her finger on the
exact spot and suggest the remedy.
The gas company gives her a good sal
ary, and it pays it to do so. for she
is the best advertising agent It could
have. At the same time she shows
consumers bow to economize gas for
fuel, how to manage their ranges and
Incidentally how to cook many a choice
dish. Mrs. Swan is very successful In
her new work.
Recently I have heard of a lady who
is the mother of 18 children. Her hus
band provided well for the numerous
progeny, and she reared them to ma
turity--the whole 18. They are doing
well enough in the world. She and her
husband have a comfortable income.
She was an admirable mother to the
children, sacrificing all the best years
of her life to them. Here Is what she
says of the lot, "I raised them well, the
whole 18, and today I could not depend
on one of them for a dinner if I needed
to do so."
A mother can make no greater mis
take than to sacrifice herself for her
children, a wife can make no greater
mistake than to sacrifice herself for her
husband. It breeds the habit of self
ishness into the very ones they try to
help.
Why Is a young lady wearing one of
the nightmare millinery creations of
the present season like the long black
letters on the first page of a yellow
journal? Becauge by is a scare bead.
If you are latigtuid and have no appe
tite these days and suftet ftom stom
ach troubles, try the no breakfast fad.
Drink water, nothing else, and eat
nothing until 11 o'clock or perhaps
noon. Then eat whatever you like, but
take no drink with your meal. If you
feel that you must have coffee, walt
till you finish enting and sip it slowly
afterward. There are those who claim
the no breakfast fad will cure almost
any disease. It certainly Is an excel
lent remedy for dyspeptic disturbance.
Two meals a day are enough for most
pec e anyhow.
The wife of a railway Ireman wants
a divorce from him because he will not
wash the black off himself when he
.omes home. She is justified. The
ourt ought to grant that divorce In
tantly.
Chicago employs 182 women in vari
mus city departments. This is owing
argely to the intluence of that gallant
woman's rights man, youngi Mayor

Can You
Swim?I
With the .hrmumeter far up in the
nineties I have just returned from a
glorious plunge in .1timntic ocean wa
ters and sit down eool and comuort:tMle
to tell my dear readers that they miss
half the fun of the world if they do not
know how to swim. wVuomen have usu
ally more difficulty than men in begin
ning to try to keep themselves up cu
the water, because they are more easily
frightened and become panicky. Boys
are allowed to go into the water and be
familiar with It almost from the time
they can walk. To overcome the panic
that seizes on so many girls in the wa
ter they have only to do as the boys
have done-go into it often. Wade
around in it, gradually deeper and
deeper, till you can walk about in water
above your waist. Meantime constant
ly paddle with your arms. One point
is to be remembered emphatically
keep your fingers together always,
making an oar blade of your open
hand. Persons who think they are
drowning and who thrash their arms
wildly about could in a moment ren
der themselves entirely safe if they
could think to keep their arms under
the surface of the water, their fingers
together, then simply pump their arms
up and down under the water. The
steady paddling downward of the
hands under water keeps the head up
easily above it and would do so all day.
Walk about In the water till you have
quite overcome your panic, meantime
waving your arms about under the wa
ter as I have told you. After you have
overcome your fear begin to use your
arms scientifically. Put your arms
close to your breast, your palms to
gether like those of people represented
.M 1
in pictures hi the Attittbde of prayer,
Thrust your arms, palms still together,
straight out in front of you full length.
Then part your hands and sweep your
arms wide out around you and back
ward, bringing them each close to your

radpially turn them like an oar blade
till your thumbs point down and the
backs of your hands would be together

14..Ay sweeping curve of the arms as dl
rected and they are close to your sides,
repeat the process again and again till
your are familiar with it If you do
Not understand this direction, read it
ever till you do.
After you have the arm motion try
that of the leg and foot. Keep both
f!eet upon the ground till you can use
Pour arms freely. Then paddle with
the arms and lift one foot off the
,round, walking upon the other. Now
Poe are swimming with all parts of the
aody except one foot. You will find
ifter a little practice that you can pro
el yourself through the water with
ene foot quite drawn up, giving your
self only an occasional shoge with the
oes of the other. After you are famil
ar with this movement you will find
'ourself bringing both feet up and
swinging before you know it simply
)y the use of your arms. Many womr
n swim in that way entirely and nev
r do get proper use of their feet,
vhich is all wrong. The swiftest
wimmers propel themselves most pow
rfully with their feet, giving them- /
elves long jumps forward like a frog.
This is how to get the use of your
eet: While you are shoving yourself
bout with your a'ms and upon one
not, draw the othor up beneath your
ody. Occasionally give a vigorous
ick with it backward and sidewise.
Vatch a frog's hind leg when he
wims, and you will get the idea ex
etly. Practice with one foot this fro
ick, the other still holding you upon
ie ground, till you get it. Try both
het, each in turn. When you have got
ie stroke and the confidence. use both
)gether. and away you go.
These are not a swimming teacher's
istructions. They give simply a plain
iethod whereby a woman who feels
taicky in the water may c-vereomne her
mar and learn to projel Herself about.
