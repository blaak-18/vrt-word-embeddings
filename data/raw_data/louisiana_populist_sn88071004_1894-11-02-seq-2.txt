OF WINN.
CAN YOUT DO IT ?
We all agree upon one question
and that is, the unprecedented
hardl times. Many of us agree as
to the cause, whether we be Demo
crats, IRepblicans or Populists.
Even Mr. Ogden, the Democratic
nomlilnce, sa1y that the hard titmes
are brought about by tihe contraC
tio of the currency. Mr. Ogdeen
also says that he stands upon the
same plan lbr relief as the Popa. I
lats and as we are now about to
east our ballot iu the most impor- I
tant election ever held in this great ]
esemtry, it is necessary that we I
lay aside prejuaiice and partisano

Sand Republicans declared upon the
0 floor of congress that they knew
00 nothing of the feature of the bill
0'to demonetize silver. Now, if this
is correct, why destroy so com
w pletely the recurd by which the
h. bill was passed. When we *-ke
into consideration that an English
capitalist was plresent with $c.0 ,
S00 to procure the passage of thi,
bill, we must brand the assertion
' of these gentlemen that they knew
b nothing about the nature of the
d bill, with absolute falsehood, and
d that Mr. Ernest Seyd was present,
and assisted in drawing the bill,
we take the following from the
Congressional Globe of April 9,
1s72, page 2304. (The act was
passed Feb. 12, 173.)
"Ernest Seyd, of London, a dis
tinguished writer and bullionist
L who is now here has given great at
tention to mint and coinage. Af
ter having examined the first draft
of this bill (for demonetization of
silver) he made various sensible
suggestions which the committee
adopted and embodied in the bill."
Is not this sufficient to establish
n the fact that these two old parties
it were in collusion in this great
8 crime of the age. We regret that we
have not the space to dwell longer
, upon this outrage as half the per
c fidly has not been told. But we
a must pass on to the year 189)3
when the most infamous plot to
u enslave the people was carried out
e while the Democratic party had ea
tire control of every branch of the
> National Government. We fiud
that such men as John Sherman,
Republican, Albert Voorhees De
mocrat, as well as Cleveland, Car
lisle and other Democrats and Re
I publicans united into one party in
which all other issues and party
f differences were set aside and the
sole question of demonetizing sil
ver was taken up and put through
Sby an extrardiinary session of
Congress called by a Democratic
president for that sole purpose and
the result is felt and known through
out all the land, it has brought f
want, misery and crime and the
end is not yet. Mr. Carlisle
(Dem..) in 1878, said:
"According to my views on the -
subject, the conspiracy which
seems to have been formed here
and in Em~pe to destroy by legas
lation and btherwise from three
sevenths to one-half of the metalic t
money of the world is the most gi- t
gautic crime of this or any other
age. The consumation of such a
acheme would ultimately entail <
more misery upon the lumun race E
than allthe wars, pestilences anda
famines that ever occurred in the
history of the world."
Yet he did all in his power to
bring it about in 1893, and when
you vote a Democratic ticket you
endorse what Mr. Carlisle sys is t
acrime. Mr. Ogden saysheis a
Democrat, if he is, he endorses the
action ofat the Democraets uas we have
stated them. Mr. Cleveland has
used his patronasge as well as all
of his olcial power to perpetuate
the perldy of the two old partles. i
He has nsed United aStu troop l
to wipe out State lines a ndbr ng
the maes of the people into sub
jeotion to the money power." He
he dempaitisd silver; he has (in

) The farimers of this country
o since the reltal of the p)urchasing
clause of the Sherman law have
) lost hundreds of millions of dol
- lars by the decline in their produce.
I and the shrinkage continues. The
) Democratic administration in one
bond issue has piled up an indelbt
e elness against this people, (without
v any nece city therefrom) the inter
11 est of which alone will amount to
S125,1(HHI bales of cotton or 5.,I4),
t- NH bushels of wheat this the al
" ready poverty stricken farmer
e must pay to the banker, it must
come, this the government will see
to, if it takes the national army
to do it. These are the conditions
we have brought about by voting
the old party ticket for 25 years.
The people's party is a new party,
that proposes to correct these evils
and it is the only party that has
ever enlightened the people on
these important issues. The old
parties have assiduously concealed
them from view while as the unde
niable records will show they have
been constantly robbing the people
by legislation in favor of the ex
treme rich individuals and corpo
rations. Mr. Ogden endorses the
Democratic party notwithstanding
its record. Mir. Bailey denounces
it and its record.
Admitting that they are equally
honest gentlemen, which can you
indorse. We consider the grave
and important issues as being too
sacred to admit of any personali
ties entering into this campaign;
we want and need all the intelli
gence and wisdom that the great
Giod has given us to determine
these issues, and therefore, we can
not afford to go into personal strife.
Therefore trust that all who
read this article may look at it in
that light, and consider well before
they cast their votes next Tuesday.
Lay down prejudice, and for one
time in your life let the interest of
your country dictate to you the
importance of your vote.
Go to the polls next Tuesday and
vote for B. W. Bailey for Congress.
Dont Want any More Banks.
Our friend of the Enterprise
says that the record of the Popu
lists in Congress don't show that
they want more money, and gives 1
as a reason that they voted against
the repeal of the tax on State
banks. Admit for the sake of ar
gument, that it is true. The re
peal of that law means more bonds
--this the Populists object to,
whether State or National It
means putting the control of the
money volume in the hands of
the State banks of issue, forcing
the people to borrow it at a high
rate of interest-this the Populists 1
object to. The people have had
enough of the banking financial(
system where the banker issues his
promise to pay, based upon the
credit of the whole I~eople, and'
upon which they (the people) must '
pay heavy interest.
The Populists claim that it is t
the duty of the National govern-'
thent to issue legal tender money
ua gold, silver or greenbacks, to a C
suniciency to do the business of '
the counlry, and the government'
will eventually do it. Now as to '
that handful of Populist. defeat
ing the entire D)emocratic party
that had a clear voting majority of
86 in the House. This same 11
Populists voted solidly against the
repeal of the ,purchasing clause of
the Sherman law. Did they de- i
feat it? No, no, the Democratic c
majority won. They voted solidly i
forthe free coinage of silver at a is
ratioof sixteen to one. Didthey e
wint No, no, the Democratic ma- tJ
jority woe of course. Now neigh- b
bor, you know that if the Popo- a
irs and 'Bpubliesam had solidly I
umited they could nt have over- tI
oaae that anqority of Demoemabt.

The albove wunhl remove any
doubt from the mind of a thinking
nman that both old parties are bent
oil plundering the masses tir the
benefit of corporations alnd classes.
It is yet fresh in the minls of the
people that but a few months ago
this nation was plunged into tur
Inoil, alnd threatened with such a
revolution as the world has nIever
knllown all on account of this same
Pullman having redluced the wages
of his laborers to starvation rates
and refusel an amicable arbitra
tion. Even the Governor of the
great State of Illinois had to call
upon the cihatrity of the whole couni
try forl aid in ordler that those able
bodied, ilnlr'strious people who had
lade 4l~02,10t1), 000 for this great
American lord in twelve years,
might be saved from a horrible
death by starvation in a laud of
plenity.
This shocking state of affairs
was brought about by this aunto
cratic nabob for no other reason
than that these samle tiree (God
save the mark) American citizens
refused to vote for Cleveland, a
Democratic candidate for presi
dent. The humane Governor of
Illinois showed plainly that his
sympathy was with this horde of
oppressed humanity, therefore this
great money king has decided that
he must have a change, hence this
great boodle fund. The honest la
bor of these poor men for which
they and their families have been
starving and which they justly
earned, is being used to 1urchase a
State government that fill oppress
them in the interest of this great
nmonied montrosity. We want to
ask the thinking man if lie can
support with his vote such a state
of atlHirs that is reducing the clas
sea to slavery.
Go to the polls next Tuesday and
vote for B. W. Bailey for Congress.
The Usual Loop Hole.
The tax on playing cards of 2
cents for each set is not likely to
yield much revenue after the pres
ent stock of cards have been ex
hausted. The law provides that a
2-cent stamp must be placed on
each set of not more than fifty-four
cards. Fifty-two cards is a pack,
but an odd one known as the joker
is always put in, making the num
ber fifty-three. It will be only
necessary now for playing-card ma
kers to put in three iokers, and the
joke will be decidedly against the
Government. That will increase
the number to fifty-five, and the
whole pack will then be exempt
from tax.-People's Champioir
Of all the stupendous frauds
ever perpetuated upon a people for
campaign purpose, the above cer
tainly "takes the cake," if not the
whole "bakery."
Got What They Did Not Ask For.
The late un-lamented Congress
after a long term of imbecillity
and cowardly inactivity, which
lorced a stagnation in business,
thereby compelling million of
workmen to stop work and half
atarve, generously before it closed t
Ioors,gave to the people a "labor
lag." Labor don't want rest, it t
wants work and good pay. Labor g
asked the Democrats for bread and a

Shaking the Bushes.

i- tries to 'keep up his courage Iby

ii count of "shaking the bushes" anl
wasting a "pint of ink," he pro

lie he penned hi. two generic editori

a must have wonderfully hdevelhped,

Ue in which he so seriously iwarned4

llmonster, neighbor, because we are
to "shake the bushes" again next
STuesday, when he will be out in
full force.
They Don't Think so at Home.
le Mr. Ogden is a master of cere
of monies, a prominent feature in leg- º
islative halls, and as the peoples
rs representative, he will do credit to,
o the 4th Congressional District, and
the masses will profit by his elee
tion.-The Excelsior.
Another case of "distance lends t
a enchantment to the view." The
ti people of Mr. Ogden's own parish t
of ought to know him better than
is anybody else, and as they failed n
of to endorse the above sentiments,
is we suppose our neighbor, as usual i
%t is looking through smoked glasses,
is and hardly responsible for what
a- he sees. Mr. Ogden failed to car- t
ll ry his own parish in the late pri- h
q mary election, and there is no h
y doubt that his own people should
a know more about him than the
s "quill driver" of the Excelsior.
it Mr. Ogden may be a master of
:o ceremonies, but the majority of P
n the people of his own parish say h
:e he will not make a good congress- il
3- man, and therefore we advise the e
voters of this district to take warn
tI ing by the verdict of the honest "
toilers of Bossier parish who are
Democrats, and have said by'their 1i
sacred ballot that Mr. Ogden is
not the man for congress. They to
2 have certainly said so because they g
o knew him. We are frank to say o
l- that we do not, but if we did, our
own opinion would sulbside when
a we lined it up with the honest ex
r pression of the people of Bossier no
:, parish. We do not claim that Mr.
r Bailey is a "master of ceremonies"
but we do claim that he is a man of ci
intelligence and ability, and above hi
e all is closely identified in every ta
e particular with the interest of the bi
e common people. We are deter- vi
mined to be fair in this campaign, t
and will therefore say that we th
know nothing of the personal char- te
acter of Mr. Ogden, but we take Il
it for granted that the people of 3t
his own parish do know, and they th
have said he is not the man for di
congress, and we shall certainly be H
governed by what they say, and
ask the people to go to the polls
and endorse them by voting for la

the farmers ought to do this and

D Why Not Vote It Now?
f Oftentimes when explaining the
F Populist platform to a wageworker,
r he will reply, "That is right; it
is a good platform, but you can't
elect your candidates this fall."
Now, just so long as farmers ai:d
wageworkers say this, just so long
will the old parties win and enact
legislation against the massess.
Every reform and every advance
towards a better condition for the
great common people has bet n
made by a new party. The two
old Iparties have outlived their
usefulness. Why throw away your
vote on them? Why not vote for
what you kuow is right and do it
nowt-[F. G. R. Gordon.
lion. H. W. Ogden has been cir
culating a circular letter, in which
he says, among other things, that
the demonitization of silver has
brought about the shrinkage of
value in produce, and consequently
the hard times. We agree with
the gentleman, but why don't he
tell that the Democrats did it in
1893, and since that time (October
30th, 1893,) the cotton farmers of
the South have lost over two hun
dred and twenty million dollars.
He adroitly conceals this fact.
Hen. B. W. Bailey addressed a
large audience of citizens at Natch
itoches on Friday, the 26th inst.
at this place. Mr. Bailey discuss
ed the issues of the day in a logi
cal and forcible manner, which
was received by his audiance with
great enthusiasm. And we believe
all were highly pleased with his
address, even the Democrats that
were present. There was dinner
on the grounds which had been
prepared by the good ladies of
Natchitoches and vicinity. There
was plenty for everybody, and
some baskets left that had not been
touched. The prospects that Mr.
Bailey will carry this parish grow
brighter and brighter every day;
this should encourage all to turn
out and vote for him.
