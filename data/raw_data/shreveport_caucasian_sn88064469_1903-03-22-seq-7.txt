At Trice's Landing the Flood 9:n
tinues to Pour Through the (re.
vasse and the Rush of the
Water is Terrific.
Memphis. March 20.-It is believed
t'.at the crtat of the Mississippi river
flood has re '0,e ! Memphis an 1 that a
fall will begin within less than twenty
four hours. However, the conditions
that exist above Memphis with the
gap in the levee at Trice's Landing,
Ark., make it a most difficule and un
certain matter to forecast what is
likely to occur in the flood situation.
The gauge Thursday night showed 40
feet and stationary, a rise of two
tenths in twenty-four hours.
While the crevasse has not widened
to any appreciable degree, the levee
is overtopped a short distanc further
to the north and the flooded Missis
sippi is discharging much water at
both this point and at the crevasse.
A difference of between four and five
feet exists in the height of the water
on either side of the lei ee at the crev
asse, and the rush of water through
the opening is terrific. The St. Fran
cis levee hoard made a second effort
to send the tug Diana and a barge
through the crevasse to assist in res
cuing people and livestock in Arkan
sas. The Diana and the government
steamer Abbot went to the crevasse
with the purpose fully formed of send.
ing the tug through in charge of Cap
tain Fogleman, who had volunteered
for the dangerous work. When the
situation was carefully inspected the
idea of putting the tug through th
gap was abandoned, as the fall is so
great and the rush of the water so
strong that it was feared the tug
could not safely pass through. About
100 yards west of the levee there is a
belt of heavy timber and the current
sweeps against the large trees with
force sufficient to make them sway
with violence. This condition made it
most probable that the tug would be
swept into the timber by the force of
the current and disabled or even over
turned. These and other unfavorable
conditions make it impossible to ease
the tug through with cables as was
contemplated, and consequently the
task has been abandoned for the pres
ent at least
A special to the Commercial-Appeal
from Marion, Ark., received at a late
hour Thursday night, tells of great
havoc by the flood at that point, and
says that such extremeties have been
reached by the people there, that it
was decided at a conference of prom
inent citizens to tlynaihite the levee
at once at Mound City, Ark., unless
the St. Francis levee board sent a
rescue boat through the break at
Trice's landing at once.
Water is running eight feet deep
through every street of the town with
fearful force, and a rapid rise is in
progress. Twenty white persons of lo
cal families are quartered in the sec
ond story of the courthouse, and fully
200 negroes, many without food are
penned up in various buildings of the
village. Several hundred head of
stock, without sufficient food, are on
platforms in the village and the first
story of all houses are under water.
The Frisco railroad tracks are cover
ed and washed for six miles, and a
handcar, bearing General Manager B.
L. Winchell, was put through from
the west with the greatest difficulty,
and grave risk. Mr. Winchell stated
that he saw no hope of opening the
line through to Memphis for at least
a week after the water shall recede.
Sheriff Williamson of Crtttenden
county and other prominent citizens,
attended the meeting at which it was
decided to dynamite the levee. The
citizens have sufficient of the explos
ive to tear an opening in the levee.
AROUND NATCHEZ.
The Water Has Washed Away a Levee
in Jedflrson County, Mississippi.
Natchez, Miss., March 20.-Alder
man A. F. Jacobs returned from a
trip to Ashland, his brother's place,
where the private levee was overtop
ped last week, the water pouring in,
washing away the levee and flooding
the western end of Jefferson county.
Nothing can be done with the levee
there and planters must wait until
the river goes down. About four hun
dred head of stock were brought down
from Ashland and stabled here in
Natchez. A heavy rain began here
Thursday night.
The inflow from Bougere crevasse
la filling Black river, that river show
ing a rise of one-tenth at Jonesville
and atWi 1ising.
The Betsy Ann came in from Bayou
Sara with another lot of refugees and
stock. She cleared as quickly as pos
sible to get another load. She was
compelled to pass a lot of stock stand
ing in water beldw Fort Adams, but
the river will have swept the stock
away before she can reach that point.
The river rose .35 In the twenty
tour hours ending Thursday afternoon
at four o'clock, which makes it 4.35
above. the danger line and rising.
The Coral, with its colony of 200
people under the bluffs at the nwrth.

off by the rising river, and several
streets in the place are filled with wa

"Tampa. March, 1903.-James Wood:
You are hereby commanded to leave

Take your big guard and leave the city

to leave the city at once. You con

You brought Wood here. You are con
spiring with the anarchists in order
to bring on a strike. You brought

next move for the good of Tampa will
be to leave the city, and if your ever
come back you do so at your own peril.
To remain 24 hours after receiving
this letter means death for both you

Police Jones Thursday night received
a lengthy telegram from Samuel Gom

CUBAN TREATY.
Reciprocity Measure Adopted and Senate
Finally Adjourn..
Washington, March 20.-After rati
fying the Cuban reciprocity treaty the
senate adjourned sine die Thursday
at fifteen minutes past 5 o'clock. Prac
tically the entire day was spent be
hind closed doors in executive session.
Mbst of the time was devoted to con
sideration of the Cuban treaty. Sev
eral speeches were made in opposition
to the treaty and in favor of it and
then promptly at the agreed hour, 3
o'clock, voting began. Roll calls were
had on a number of amendments and
the treaty itself was made the sub
ject of an eye and no vote. The mo
tion to ratify was adopted by a ballot
of fifty to sixteen, somewhat more
than a three-fourths vote, where as
only a two-thirds vote was necessary
to secure a ratification.
Immediately after the doors were
closed a few minutes past 11 o'clock,
Senator Foster of Louisiana took the
floor in order to make a set speech in
opposition to the treaty. He spoke
for about two hours and a half. His
address had been prepared carefully,
and on its conclusion Mr. Foster very
generally was complimented on his
manner of presenting the *opposition
view to the treaty. In the main his
speech was an appeal for the protec
tion of the American s"!gar producing
industry.
Senator Allison and Cockrell were
appointed a committee to visit the
white house and notify the president
the senate was ready to adjourn if he
had nothing further to communicate.
Upon their return they reported the
president' had no further business,
whereupon sifie die adjournment was
taken.

SYSTEM OF SUCCESSION.
When it comes to endorsing the thor
oughness, efficiency and honesty with
which our State government is adminis
tered. TVe Felicianas is an administra
tion organ. When it comes to opposing
the idea or principle of an administra
tion endeavoring to perpetuate itself, or
name its successors, or to throw the
weight and power of its influence in op
position to a free and untrammeled
choice of the people, then it is anti
administration.-The Felicianas.
The "free and untrammeled choice of
the people" is a delusion. The people
have been "snared" so often until they
have about lost all energy of resistance.
In no State of the Union is there such
autocracy maintained in the name of
Democracy. This condition, however,
will continue until the Democracy, the
Democrats who vote, shall resist and
overthrow the outrageous system of stc
cession.
THE LOUISIANA DEMOCRACY.
The Felicianas, published at Jackson,
La., says: "Louisiana Democracy re
minds one o fa certain game of poker
that a novice participated in, being ..s
sured that it was only a friendly, so
ciable (?) game among gentlemen. He
Fields threes, fours, straights, flushes, s.l
dom less than a full hand-but was in
variably beaten. Finally, when his ring,
watch, and every other asset had fol
lowed his cash, he exclaimed, with a
voice filled with emomtion: 'Gentlemen
-if you are gentlemen-you hold some
of the - hands of any set of gen
tlemen I ever played with.'
"With a high tariff delegation in Con
gress-with old reconstruction method.
designed to disfranchise Republican ne
groes rammed down the throats of its
members-with a disfranchised Republi
can negro population included in the
basis of representation for white Demo
cratic conventions-without the right of
a primary voice in the selection of offi
cials-we can truly say: 'Gentlemen, if
you are Democrats, you have some of
the --- methods of any Democrats
we know.

the levees arc invaria.lhv ,:.,,d front one
to three feet, and yet a fei'w ieairs later
the water goes )ill higher thaxn at any
past time in the river's histo ry.
"Now, there seems to b.e buit tonet wtay
to account for this condiition, and( that is
that the bottom of the river fills upt as
the levees along its hank are raised.
"I venture in the way of prophecy that
some day there will be a canal with locks
cut through Lake Maurepas above the
city into Lake Pontchartrain wide andi
deep enough so that during tloods it can
be opened and the floods in the river re
duced.
"Such a canal would not raise the level
of the lake nearly so much is a strong
wind from the gulf often dctes.
"I am convinced in my own mind that
this present high water which willireak
all past records, will set a mighty crat
rent of interest to work towards securing
an outlet system. I know that eminetd
engineers have combatted the outlet sys
tem in the past and many will dioubtless
do so in the future, but at least another
high water in the river, surpassing the
present record-breaker, will convince the
most skeptical or those who because of
their interest in present systems find it
most convenient to stick to the levee
theory and cause them to fall into line
with the outlet theorists.
"T'he time is coming when the Missis
sippi will he provided with outlets and
then there will be no more 'records' es
tablished by high water periods."
"QUITE ENOUGH OF BRYAN."
"It must be evident to the supporters
of William Jennings Bryan-the writer
was one of them in the campaigns of
1896 and Igoo--that the Nebraskan has
developed into a political marplot and
nuisance, of whom the country is grow
ing awfully tired. The Bryan of today is
not the Bryan of eight years ago. T'hen
he was a man of gentle temper and per
fect self-possession, but having been
beaten in two presidential elections he
has become 'a man with a grievance' and
an insatiate appetite for revenge. He be
lieves, or pretends to believe, that every
man who did not blindly follow his
financial theory should be driven out of
the Democratic party, especially Grover
Cleveland, and those closely associated
with the ex-president."
"As we have already remarked, the
Democratic party is getting tired of Mr.
Bryan and his deliberate mischief mak
ing, and it is to be hoped that when the
next Democratic National Convention is
held he will be dumped overboard and
given an opportunity to 'organize a party
for his exclusive use.' It is as certain as
anything can be that the Democratic
party has quite enough of Mr. Bryan,
that its 'exclusive use' by him is no long
er possible. -He is now engaged in mak
ing trouble for the Democracy that has
twice honored him, but in the end we are
quite sure the trouble will roost at hi
own doors. The Bryan party of t904 will
neither be for,nidable nor frightening."
New Orleans States.
QUITE ENOUGH OF CLEVELANI)
In the same time and temper, as indi
cated by the excerpts from the New Or
leans, we may say that it is quite evident
that the Democratic party, the six tnil
lion and more of D)emocrats w ho op
posed the Cleveland-McKinley combine
an:d were stcadfast to Bryan and the
platform iof the party. are getting tired
of Mr. Cievt land. and it i, about time he

Clevt land and who will oppose his lead
ership of the party. 'We do not think it to
be good policy to belittle Mr. Bryan or
to strive to place him in a false attitude.
Any and every such attempt will only in
