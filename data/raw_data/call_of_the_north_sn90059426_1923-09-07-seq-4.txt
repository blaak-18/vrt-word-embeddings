MINNEAPOLIS K.K.K.
IN ALBERT LEA RITES
—K-K-K
RAINSTORM STALLS 250 KLANS
MEN WHO MISS INITIATION
BUT MARCH IN PARADE
—K-K-K
Albert Lea, Minn., Sept. I.—Two
hundred fifty Minneapolis members
of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
participated in a parade through the
streets of Albert Lea last night, at
the close of a public initiation cere
mony on the Freeborn county fair
grounds, north of the city.
The Minneapolis delegation was
stalled between St. Paul and Albert
Lea on the Jefferson highway by a
heavy rainstorm and failed to arrive
in time for the ceremonial rites. All
of their cars were marked “K.K.K.,
Minneapolis.”
The ceremony took place on a large
platform in front of the grand stand.
The whole inside of the race track
was filled with klansmen in full uni
form on horse and on foot, forming
a circle around fiery crosses 35 feet
in height. The display of fireworks
falling over the platform and burn
ing crosses, the red fire turning the
great raindrops a deep red as they
fell, made an impressive and spec
tacular scene.
All through the rain, the klan offi
cers and men in full regalia were
drenched to the skin, their flag hung
wet and the water ran off the plat
form as off the roof of a house. Even
the racetrack was covered with a
lake of water and poured off along
the side and under the grandstand
and automobiles. Many cats at the
end of the meeting were stalled in
a sea of mud and water and had to
be hauled out.
The meeting opened with the Klans
men and the whole audience singing
“America,” led by the band. This
was followed by a fervent prayer by
Dr. Harper, national lecturer for the
Ku Klux Klan.
“Twilight” Orn, editor of the Call
of the North, newspaper of St. Paul
was introduced as the speaker of the
evening. For two hours in full uni
form he stood in the rain. He was
cheered by the crowd until he grew
hoarse. He explained in detail what
the Klan stood for, its principles and
teachings.
SPECTACULAR KU KLUX KLAN MEETING AT
FAIR GROUNDS WITNESSED BY THOUSANDS
K.K.K—
In Spite of Downpour of Rain Public Initiation and Naturalization Took
Place Before Grand Stand at Fair Grounds Friday Night Amid Fire
works, Burning Crosses, Red Fire and White Robed Klansmen on
Horses and Afoot—Full Ceremony Takes Place With All Klansmen
and Candidates Unmasked—Great Crowd of Men, Women and Children
Applaud “Twilight” Orn as He Tells the Principles' and Teachings of
the Klan—Audience Led by Hayward Band, Sings “America” and Dr.
Harper Offers Fervent Prayer.
K.K.K.
It rained in torrents. Water cover
ed the platform and run off its sides
as the roof of a house. The race
track filled full until it resembled a
river. Then it spilled over into rivu
lets which ran beneath the grand
stand under and between the hun
dreds of automobiles parked two or
three deep in a great semi-circle ex
tending from the feed barns
north to the main entrance gate lead
ing to the Jefferson highway to the
southeast. And still is rained drench
ing to the skin the finely robed of
ficers and members.
But the ardor of these men, mem
bers of the Ku Klux Klan could not be
dampened for they had called a meet
ing for Friday night to give to the
populace the first public initiation and
naturalization of the order ever given
in the State of Minnesota. They had
advertised it to take place on the
Freeborn County Fair grounds north
of the city on Friday evening at eight
o’clock. And it was staged just as
scheduled.
Shortly after six o’clock automo
biles from all over the city and near
by territory began to arrive at the
fair grounds. The grandstand quick
ly filled and the occupants of the cars
coming later remained in their park
ed cars to see —if not to hear —the
ceremony.
After the presiding officer, in full
regalia, excepting his mask, had call
ed the meeting to order, the audience
Tose and sang “America.” They were
lead by the Hayward band. Dr. Harp
er, national lecturer for the Ku Klux
Klan then offered prayer. On the
platform was a flag decorated table
and beside it a large burning cross.
To one side of the table was the Stars
and Stripes.
"Twiglight” Orn, Editor of the Call
of the North,” the official newspaper
of the Klan published in St. Paul, was
introduced as the speaker of the eve
ning. For nearly an hour and one
half this robed man with his powerful
voice, explained the teachings and
principals of the order. He said:
“Any ‘Native Born’ American citizen
is eligible to become a member who
has the best interest of his commun
ity, city, state and nation at heart,
owing no allegiance to any foreign
Government, political party, sect,
creed or ruler, and engaged in a
Legitimate occupation, and who be

Religion, white supremacy, protection

FUMING CROSS
AT MEDFORD
VILLAGERS STARTLED FROM
THEIR SLUMBERS
—K-K-K—
--(Owatonna Journal-Chronicle)
The residents of this village were
startled from their slumbers about
eleven o'clock Monday evening by a
terrific explosion and on rushing to
windows or doors beheld a huge flam
ing cross on the hill east of town.
From reports it seems that the cross
was erected on the hill and then a
heavy charge of dynamite exploded
nearby to attract attention to this
spectacle. Following the appearance
of the flaming cross it is said that
several men were seen running down
the hill, at the foot of which they
jumped into waiting cars and rapidly
drove away. No explanation has
been forthcoming as to the perpetra
tors of this scene but it is generally
assumed to be the work of the K.K.K.
It is not known whether there is a
local IjClan. --

WHAT ONE FAMOUS CRITIC
SAYS ABOUT THE KLAN
(George Jean Nathan in “The ..
Smart Set.”
Not a single solitary sound reason
has yet been advanced for putting
the Ku Klux Klan out of business. If
the Klan is against the Catholics, so
are the Masons. If the Klan is
is against the Jew, so are half of
the good hotels of the Republic and
three-quarters of the good clubs. If
the Klan is against the foreign-born
or hyphenated citizen, so is the Nat
ional Institute of Arts and Letters.
If the Klan is against the negro, so
are all the states south of the Mason-
Dixon line. If the Klan is bent upon
political control, so are the American
Legion and Tammany Hall. If the
Klan wears grotesque uniforms, so do
the Knights of Pythias and the Mys
tic Shriners. If the Klan holds meet
ings in the dead of night, so do the
Elks. If the Klan conducts its bus
iness in secret, so do all the college
Greek letter fraternities and the De
partment of State. If the Klan holds
idiotic parades in the public streets,
so do the police, the letter carriers
and the firemen. If the Klan’s offi-

strikes by foreign labor agitators, pre

property by lawless elements, the

much needed local reforms and Law
and order.”
At the conclusion of his speech the
band started playing and the presid
ing officer raised his hand first to the
north and then to the west. Out of
the darkness and rain there suddenly
appeared the white robed Klansmen.
The columns of footmen were lead by
horsemen, carrying the Stars and
Stripes.
As they came silently and quickly
down the tracks into the brilliancy of
the red fire and display of fireworks
their white robes caught the spirit of
the great red rain drops as they fell
for they changed to red and gold as
the members marched to the center of
the track and formed in two large
semi-circles about the platform with
the horsemen standing at attention
forming the outer circle.
Then came the candidates on foot
and in civilian clothes, led by mount
ed Klansmen. Ouly two candidates
were escorted to the platform where
the complete oath of the order was
administered aloud in due form. As
the last words of the oath were pro
nounced the three crosses thirty-five
feet in height, within the circle of
Klansmen round the platform, were
fired. The crosses, together with the
red fire burning brightly, the fire
works bursting over head, the rain
falling straight down and the robed
members—all taken as a whole—de
picted one of the most spectacular
scenes ever witnessed in this part of
the state.
The meeting closed with the song
“Nearer My God to Thee," led by
the band.
Immediately the Klansmen were
taken to the city. Forming on East
Clark street they marched through
the principal street of the city. Two
hundred and fifty Klansmen from
Minneapolis, who were to take part
in the ceremony, were caught in the
storm somewhere south of Farming
ton and did not arrive until the af
fair on the fair grounds was nearly
over. However they assisted in the
parade.
Many cars at the fair grounds
after the ceremony became stuck in
the seas of mud and the drivers work
ed for some time before they could
get out of the grounds onto the high
way.
During the whole evening no neei
dents or disturbances took plaee.

celebration which will be a gala day
here on the 15th. The boys here
are working overtime to complete all
arrangements, so a big time is as
sured. >
Many local Klansmen went to Al
bert Lea and enjoyed the Klan meet
there so much that they decided defi
nitely to pull off a celebration that
will be a humdinger in every proper
way. We are praying for fair
weather and sunshine on the 15tb
of September.
We want all Klansmen who have
robes, to bring them along. We hope
in the meantime that many Citizens
will purchase robes so that a thous
and men at least may take part in
the parade. All roads lead to Aus
tin on the 15th. It’s Austin or bust.
There Is considerable Klan activ
ity around here and Protestants are
awakening as never before, which
puts a stiffness in the spine that
makes us lift our heads higher and
cheers us to greater efforts.
cers bear rediculous names, so do the
officers of the Lamb’s club. If the
Klan constitutes itself a censor of
private morals so does the Congress
of the United States. If the Klan
lynches a Moor for raping someone’s
daughter, so would you or I.

THE CALL OF THE NORTH
MURDER SAYS
KING KLEAGLE
Declares Constitution Was “Struck
Sam D. Rich, king kleagle of the
Ku Klux Klan of Pennsylvania, issued
the following statement regarding
the attitude of the Pennsylvania
Klansmen following the death of one
of their members at th« hands of a
bigoted mob.
“The tenets of the United States
Constitution have been struck a foul
blow by the action Saturday night
of a mob of Carnegie residents in, at
tacking parading Klansmen during
which Klansmen Thomas R. Abbott
of Burgettstown, was murdered. When
conditions come to such a stage in
this enlightened age that peaceful
Americans banding themselves into*a
patriotic organization are prevented
from exercising the same rights as
Catholics, Jews and negroes, and
which are guaranteed Tby that Consti
tution formed by our forefathers, it
is high time action is taken.
“Catholics, Jewish, Italian and ne
gro people have paraded the byways
of this Pittsburgh community and not
once has a participant been harmed
in the least by a Protestant specta
tor. The regrettable and certainly
ruthless action of the un-American
element of Carnegie’s citizenry Sat
urday night is just cause for a great
er concentration on the part of 100
per cent American citizens with a
view of preventing its recurrence.
And we, as Klansmen, pledge our
selves to this just cause.
