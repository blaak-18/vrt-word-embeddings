PROHIBITION.
To the Voters of Natchitoches
Parish.
It has been said, and is being
ased now by the anti-prohibitioli
ists that the prohibition movement
was gotten up by the politicians to
break up the People's party-and
we, the undersigned, who origina
ted this movement, think it neces
nary that the public should know
the origin of it. On the 28th of
December, 1894, C. F. L'herisson,
W. F. Fuqua, McK. IHolaton and
E. J. Gamble, were sitting in the
Natchitochese niiroad office discus
sing the Ouachita prohibition elec
tion, and the question was asked
by lr. - if it would not be a
good thing if whiskey could be vo
ted out of Natchitochea parish, and
if now would not be a good time to
hold the election-and after con
siderable.discussion we decided to
get up a petition and see what our
people thought of the matter. Each
of us pledging to do what we could
for the benefit of the movement.
Mr. Gamble then went around and
saw several parties, who each and
every one gave him every eneour
agemett. Hence the petition to
go before the police jury. Now
you have the origin of the move
ment, and this is written to explain
to the voters of Natehitoches par.
lah that it is no politiead move, nov
ertheless some of the leaders of the
People's party are trying to ina
press on oar people that it is noth
iug bit a political trick to barst up
that party. So you can see that
the oriinatiors were equally dirt
ded, two being strong Democrats
and two being as equally strong
Peopls party. We sinceurely hope
tlht ia isi contest all politieal bit
teres will be laid asle, sad eaeb
vtter will use hil own judgment as
a eltisen on this question. We
Ibek at It as a oelfal and not a po-.
litihl questio.

Nb was walk Ya*
or th as -
to be, a politiciant orllan office-seek- M 1
er; so that we could not have re- t
ferred to them. '
The whole gist of our article m
shows plainly that we were criti- a
i-ising the illegal and unuwarranted a
4ation of the police jury, which ac- 1
li0n3 we could inot t el;, nlor ('Vanl we
low, account for except by attribu
inug it, as we did, to a desire to e
miake a political hobby out of it. L
The police j.iury may not ire poli- I
ticians, but tihere is not now a po- v
lice jury in this State that isn't a I
political creation- a reward for !
political services that have been or t
may be rendlered, and nobody pre- o
tendls to deny it. It is silmpossible
to have anythiig else unnder te 1
appolmintive system, which has very
Iroperly beent repealed as to them. V
.We do inot claunl that politicians i
originated this moveient. We
believe the ftour gentlement nauled
above, are as free fromi professional
politics as anly that could be found
in this city. iBut practical politi
cians seldomn invent their hobbies,
thoulgh they are always found de
cidedlly on one side or tihe other.
The story of the origin of this
movement (prohibition) as related
above, reminds its very forcibly of
a bit of mtloern history with which 3
the voters of Natchitoches are
painfilly faimiliar.
InI August 1890, the State Farm
ers Alliance met at Alexandria,
ind during their session1 passed an
innocent resolution denounicing the
La. Lottery as a social and politi
cal evil, (same against whiskey)
and pledging its united opposition
to it. Later, Baptist conventionls,
Methodist conferoences and great
city plueachers denounced it.
Nobody supposed politics was at
the bottom of this, and they were
not, but politicians took hold of it
and soon had farmers, churches,
preachers, and all "at the bottom
of it," and the saddle well strap
ped on, and the world knows the
result.
In that fight we urged and beg
ged the Farmers Alhliance to "turn
neitlher to the right nor to the left,"
but to keep straight ahead in sup
port of the "Ocala Demands," but
to no avail, the politicians were in
the saddle. They are now in office,
the lottery is dead and so is the
Farmer's Alliance, while the Ocala
Demands are known only in the
People's party platform, and we
have a hundred lotteries worse than
the one we killed.
It was to prevent a repetition of
this history on a small scale that
we sounded a note of warning to
our party last week. We will vote
for prohibition-have always done
so, but when we hear a lawyer,
who is enjoying some of the spoils
of political victory (but of course
ie's no politician), say that proba
bly 2-thirds ot his practice grows
either directly or indirectly out of
the sale of whiskey, and yet he is
in favor of prohibition, we feel
ashamed cf the taumeness of our
enthusiasm, and vainly look for a
chip with a spraddle-bug under it.
We have heard one of our beat
Populists say that prohibition was
a greater necessity in tese hard
times, and that his party ought to
endorse It. In view of the fgdt
that this would drive some of our
support away, and prolong our ef
forts to relieve "these hard times,"
the proposition reminds us of a
man who suggested that his neigh
bor quit worting for bread to satis
fy hise hunger, but go hunt some
gvn persimmons and eat them to
4raw his stomach ap to a size that
wouM suit his cupboard.
Some of'our friends objected to
our statement last week that cot
ton was stil 4 cents in Winn, that
sliver was searce, and that they
had nothing but prohltion, and
very little of that. Now every
word of tis can be proven, but
we made the statement only to
show the demagoguey et euch ar
gument as that of the Entesprise's
where it sa~ys that th prohibition
is believe that it will bring "an
era of prosperty such as this par
d has anever known?
No everi
Ut we believed that, we would
qut the Peoples party noe, and
kiek omelf fur me hviagDined
the Proirb1ti pwrt sveural yws
ageo; and it is to pmset soch
seane d a Inang eo the edua
-rk ple the. line at the
show up thle foolishness of some of
the claims of the prohibitionists.
This is our duty to our party, and
we are perfectly willing to go a
ahead in the discharge ot it, and P1
allow the Enterprise to charge us I1
with liwing an "opponent" of the s
"imiovemlent." ad libiturnm.
We hope that all Populists, and e
every one else, will vote tor prohi- p
hition, but we shall think none the
less of them if they do not, and t]
w.e most earnestly hope that no ii
Populist will allow this question to n
hindelr himi in the work of his par- e
ty, nor 1,rejudice him against any b
of his fellow-workers. c
Because the principles of our a
platform promise us the only hope i
of permanent relief, and compare
with the prohibition question in
importance as the noonday sun to
a tallow-dip.
Support Your Paper.
f
This issue makes five month s t
this paper has been running as the e
organ of the People's party of i
Natchitoches parish, of the 4th i
Congressional district, and of the I
State of IAuisiana, and it is alive s
and making a good, readable paper t
yet. C
But, friend, did you know that
if it had not been for the sacrifices º
of a few big-hearted supporters of e
our cause in this city and one or c
two in the parish, it wouid have c
suspended long ago ? 1
Have you done your duty, my
friend, by the cause you advocate ?
Have you taken any stock in the
paper I Have you even paid your
own subscription Many of you
have not, and it is a shame, not on t
the paper, but on you,
We have been faithfully fighting
your battles here and all over the
state and 4th district, and have
succeeded wonderfully well, when
you consider the time and energy
we have had to devote to the strug
gle for existance.
Oh, what a brilliant, spicy,
readable paper we could get up
for you, if you would only do your
part, not somebody elsos', but
simply yours!
And what a power this paper
would be in the land and in fight
ing your battles, and how much
stronger and faster would your
cause and your party grow, if
you would only do your duty by
it!
Suppose you try it, and see the
resnlt. Let everybody that owes
this paper a subscription send it
in now, and see if it does not im
prove things, then if it does we'll
tell you what to do next.
I)on't wait now, but come right
along.
Hard times are pinching you, we
know that, and we are trying to
hell;you fight the imps of Satan
who made times hard, but if you
sit down, with every joint limber,
and your tongue lolled out like a
sulled calf in a bog, we toll you
plainly that we'll never, nerer,
NEVER be able to pull you out.
Neither will anybody else pull you
out, and your children will see ten
tins harder ways than you are
suffering from.
Oh, its coming, ten times worse
than it is now, and yhad better
he up and fighting while you can.
We've fought for you in this pa
p'er and others for four long years
and a half, and now if you don't do
your duty it's a "gone fawn skin."
Rattle up, and all's well.

Dear Friend:-Puah the people
on the contest fund. I have a
subecription list, only a few days
old. with about $10 00 on it. I
think I will raise $20 00 or more
before I am through.
Yours truly,

The people print money, give it

people to scoop 'em in that wayl-

pu1h,,lý ithli the saime vi' or and i
earnestness that the campaign was !
prosecutedl. j
It is indeed gratifying to know
that so much patriotism yet burns
in the hearts of our people, and it
never answered a worthier or more
earnest appeal than that sent out
by Mr. Bailey, who made our
campaign such a brilliant success i
and who is determined to push the
tight into the "last ditches," re- i
gardless of the personal sacrifices i
it umay cost him. i
Only a portion of the money i
necessary to make the contest has
been raised as yet, but enough to t
foretell what will be (lone, and as
the time is limited, we would urge
every community to have its meet
ing, raise what it can and forward
it to this office or direct to Mr.
Bailey at Winnfield. Let no per
son begin this fight for fair elec
tions and liberty and take the risk
of being the cause of failure.
Furnish MIr. Bailey with the
means and the fraud will be expos
ed and the thieves will be punish
ed. And when this is done a time
or two, cheating at elections will
become very popular.
Thin As Gruel.
In its article on prohibition last
week our neighbor, the Enterprise
says: "It is a well known fact
that politicians always fight shy of
an issue like this until it is actual
ly forced npon them and they are
compuelled to take sides, an!l then
in a majority of cases, they man
age to stay on the fence."
This assertion is as thin as chari
ty soup.
If that doctrine is true, how did
the Enterprise vanqnish its oplro
nent in the last campaign by stay
ing so decidedly on one side of a
similar question and later enjoying
all the fat emoluments of victory?
How did the ntn who wrote
that article come to share in the
spoils as Parish Treasurer, if not
by getting on one side of an is
sue (hobby) and staying there?
If you will reverse your rule
neighbor, it might work.
There is no project in the world
of much more interest to the Amer
ican wheat grower than the Siberi
an railroad. Another division 235
miles long was opened last week.
Every new line added to this sys
tent weakens the control of this
country on the wheat markets of
the world. The American wheat
raiser must give up wheat raising
and turn to stock and other grains.
--Argus-Leader.
Does the Argus.-Leader presume
that the Russians cannot raise
"stock and other grains" alsot We
woull suggest that a much better
plan would be to give our wheat
raisers the same advantage of a
government owned and operated
railroad with transportation at
cost.
To shift to "stock and other
grains" is simply a temporary ex
ledient. The Czar of Russia has
greater consideration for his sub
jects than the Amenrcau people
have for themselves.-Dakota Ru
ralist.
Down here, we are advised to
quit raising cotton, the nataral
product of our climate, and "diver
sify"-raise corn, wheat, anything
not adapted to this country, but
we didn't know yon fellows
were being humbugged with the
same stuff-"Diversfy." We
knew(1) we were raising so much
cottont, we could hardly ever get a
biscait, and seldom a new shirt (of
cotton), but we had no idea you
were raising so much wheat you
couldn't get a biscauit either.
Well I well! ! We down Southare
raising so much cotton, sugar and
rice, you up North are raising so
much oorn, wheat and hogs, they
out Wesi are raising so much wool,
beef and silver, and they back
East are "mantfaeterin" it so fast
that we get but 4 cents for eotton,
6 cents for wool, the tariff for su
gar and rice, 48 cents for silver 11
cents for beef, ditto for pork, 45
cents for wheat, S5 cents for corn
and selling it all for taxes and the
mortgage. Well well!l our eribs
and amokehoases and storehouses
sad warehouses, are getting so fa,l
ve are jnst starving to death, and e
ur pohlitical leaders are advising i
I to swap crops with each other, d
aise wheat in the South, and cot- d
on in I)akota-revolutionize ia

Well, they ought to know, and s
f we talked about thlie go\ern ii

If you voted the Populist ticket
and want the frauds coumlitted by
the ballot box thieves in the last
election exposed, the perpetrators
sent to the penitentiary, Mr. Og
den unseated, and Mr. Bailey who
was elected by the people seated
in the 54th Congress, then you
should contribute your mite to help
accomplish this great work. Mr.
Bailey within himself is powerless
and cannot successfully prlosecute
the contest he is undertaking to
make without assistance.-Win
field Comrade.
The total vote cast in this state
by the People's party, for Con
gressman was, according to demo
cratic count, 15,333.
This is the largest straightout
Populist vote we have ever cast,
and is three times as large as the
number given Louisiana in the New
York World's tabulation of 1,f0Nt,
(MH) for the United States.
We believe our total vote in the
Union was over 2,00Q),tM and that
in '96 it will be over 5,O4N),t11N.
OITUARY.
Samuel Henry Mayben, son of
Mbr. and Mrs. J. O. Mayben, was
born January 9th, 1869, and died
December 19th, 1894 ; aged 25 years,
11 months and 10 days.
He was in bed about ten weeks
with slow fever. He suffered in
tensely. He never mourned nor
complained during his afilctiou,
but bore his sickness with patience
and gneat fortitude. iHe hkid all
the medical aid necessary. The
writer visited him several times dn
ring his illness; and prayed and
talked with him about eternal sal
vation, and he promised me to seek
Ohrist.
Later on the writer talked with
him, and he said that all was well,
and that he had no fear of death.
He said he would like to get well
if it was the Lord's will, but he wis
reconciled to the will ot God. At
last the messenger of death came
on Wednesday at 4 o'clock, p. m.
The writer was with him until the
last breath left him.
He died perfectly easy, almost
like one sleeping. He was one of
the best young men I ever knew,
every body loved him; to know
him was to like him. Hewas a
I true Alliance man, belonging to
Grappe's Bluff lodge; a genuine
Populist; as true as true can be;
perfectly honest and upright, al
ways ready to lend a helping hand
to the needy. The writer remem
Sbers how kind he was last Spriug
Swhen I had no borse, he let me
have his several months. Yes, he
Swas kind and good hearted.
At his funeral there was as much
weeping as I ever saw. He is gone
Swhere there is no weeping; but he
Sleaves a father and mother and
five sisters, and three brothers and
a host of other relatives and friends
to mourn his fate.
SWhy start! this call will be ours very
soon,
In some few years, perhaps the coming
moon.
SLife at its utmost length, is scarce a
breath,
SAnd those who longest dream must
Swake in death.
a His flesh shall slumber in the ground
e Till the trumpet's joyful sound;
Then burst the chains with sweet surpriso
And in his Saviour's image rise.
His spirit has returned to God
who gave it, and now is arounda
Sthe throne basking in the sun
d shine of eternal felicity.
SOur brother the haven hath gained,
Out-flying the tempest and wind;
- His rest he hath sooner obtained.
r And left many of his friends behind.
