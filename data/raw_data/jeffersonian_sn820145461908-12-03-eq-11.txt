Sleep
Sleep is nature’s
building period, when the
energy used by the brain,
muscles and organs is re
newed. If you lose sleep,
your system is robbed of
the strength sleep should
give. Continued loss of
sleep multiplies this loss
until you become a phys
ical wreck. Dr. Miles’
Nervine quiets the irri
tated nerves and brings
refreshing, invigorating
sleep. Nervine contains
no opiates, and therefor
leaves no bad after-effects.
“For over two years I suffered un
told agonies; my ffiends thought I
was going crazy. i could not sleep
nor rest at all. I tried different doc
tors, but failed to find relief. My
head would ache all the time; I was
like one drunk; could not concentrate
my mind, and was so restless and
worried that sleep was out of the
question. After taking one bottle of
Dr. Miles’ Nervine I felt wonderfully
changed. I am now on my third bot
tle and am gaining all the time. I
can lie down and sleep like a child,
and am able to do my work.”

ROOSEVELT AND HEARST.
Persistent rumors are going the
rounds to the effect that Mr. Roose
velt is about to take a contract with
Mr. Hearst to work on one of his pa
pers, after he shall leave the White
House. This rumor may be given
credence by the fact that Mr. Hearst
seems always eager to engage men
for work on his papers who are vig
orous writers and who, in addition to
this, have won a, national reputation.
He has many such men working for
him and constantly tries to get more.
He is able to pay them princely sal
aries and is liberal enough to offer
this. Tn this way he secured the ser
vices of Hon. John Temple Graves.
Tn this way he tried but failed to get
Hon. Thomas* E. Watson to work for
him—and parenthetically it may be
observed here that those who can see
no good in Mr. Watson should at
least place this refusal to work for
Mr. Hearst to his credit. And in
this way it is quite natural that
Hearst should now try to get Mr.
Roosevelt to work for him.
Will Mr. Roosevelt accept? His
friends, and all who have admired
him, and their number is legion, hope
that he will-not fall so low. Speak
ing of this the Richmond News-Lead
er expresses the sentiment of the
majority of Americans when it says:
11 President Roosevelt may always
be expected to do unexpected things.
We confess, however, to a distinct
shock of disappointment and mortifi
cation at the announcement that he
is considering a proposition to hire
himself, at the end of his term, to
write for the Hearst newspapers and
that he has had an interview on that
subject with Hearst. We had given
Mr„ Roosevelt credit for certain in
stincts of dignity and propriety sup
posed to be part of the nature of a
well-bred man. If he accepts this
job we shall be compelled regretfully
to revise our opinion of him. Hearst
is the dirtiest figure in American pol
itics and journalism. Many very re
spectable gentlemen work on his
newspaper, but there is a wide differ
ence between the case of an ordinary
citizen and an ex-president of these
United States.
“The people of this country, by
making Mr. Roosevelt president, con
ferred on him a certain dignity which
in honor and decency he is bound to
respect and a certain responsibility
which he ought to feel. For him to
use the prominence given him by the
American people as a stock in trade
and a means of making money for
himself would be an offense little
short of treason. Working on The
Outlook, which is a. dignified, clean
and honorable publication, notwith
standing its occasional fanaticisms
and crankiness, is one thing; to hire
his name and prestige to give power
and influence to disreputable yellow
sheets owned and conducted by a dis
reputable man for disreputable pur
poses is a widely different thing. One
of the reasons we always have had
for distrusting Mr. Bryan was his ap
parent readiness to hitch himself to
any kind of proposition or enterprise
in which he might use his reputation
as a means of earning dollars. We
would dislike very much to see .Mr.
Roosevelt put himself on the same un-
Ulje Jeffersonian
pleasant level.” —Augusta, Ga., Her
ald.
GOOD HINT.
Here is a very suggestive item from
the Farmers’ Union Sun: “We stop
ped at the home of a gentleman and
while there asked him if he had join
ed the Union. His reply was, ‘When
the local was organized I was away.
When I came back I expected to join,
but not a soul has asked me to join,
and I have felt backward about but
ting in.’ That man is in the same fix
as a lot of other men. Thev have
never been asked to join. The mem
bers of the Union have not thought
enough of their organization to ask
their neighbors to come in and help
them. If you have been guilty of
such neglect and lack of hospitality,
shake yourself and determine that
you will not be so any more. Go out
and get your neighbors to come in with
you. All they need is a little urg
ing. ’ ’
SOME PET ECONOMIES.
Saving String and Paper we Never
Use—Wasted Medicines.
Hardly a person exists without
some favorite economy, some little
senseless tribute which he offers at
the shrine of thrift and by which he
saves —just nothing.
Some people refuse to cut the string
of parcels and waste precious minutes
laboriously untying knots. Others
store away scraps of lace and silk,
and are delighted when a stray occa
sion justifies their practice by making
use of a hoarded treasure.
I myself have a weakness for half
sheets of note paper. I am annoyed
exceedingly when I receive a letter
with the third page covered and the
second blank. It seems an opportu
nity missed. Yet as I rarely make
use of my pieces I can only keep them
from a magpie love of saving.
Apropos of this subject, I remember
a clergyman once telling me about an
aunt of his who, in her eagerness that
nothing should be wasted, insisted
upon drinking the remaining doses in
any medicine bottles that the invalids
in the household had been unable to
finish.
This seems carrying a good princi
ple a little too far. —London Black
and White.
Those who have practiced both
systems declare that the best results
are obtained by scattering mianure
over the fields while it is fresh. But
where this is impossible it will pay
to pile it- up nicely in the yard. This,
however, should not be permitted to
remain long as it will make too much
litter for the barnyard. A receptacle
for it can be built very cheaply by
setting four posts and nailing boards
sufficient to hold it. Two or three
feet of straw should be put in the
bottom in order to keep the manure
nearest to the ground from leaching.
This manner of taking care of the
manure is recommended only where
it is impossible to load the manure on
a manure spreader and haul it to
the field. —Farmers’ Advocate.
