W. C. T. U. AND COCA-COLA
Homer, N. Y., Nov. 7, 1907.
To the Editor of the Druggists’ Cir
cular:
As many druggists are aware of the
fact that the medical temperance de
partment of the National Woman’s
Christian Temperance Union has op
posed the beverage Coca-Cola for
years past, it may be of some interest
to them to know of a recent confer
ence held by the general sales man
ager of the Coca-Cola Company with
me, in the Yates Hotel, Syracuse,
N. Y. This conference was held by re
quest of Mr. S. C. Dobbs, the mana
ger referred to, his object being, as
he stated it, to convince me of the
harmlessness of Coca-Cola. I was ac
companied by the president of the
Onondaga County Woman’s Christian
Temperance Union, and Mr. Dobbs
had with him a Coca-Cola salesman.
I was not there to talk, but to lis
ten, so I had very little to say except
to ask an occasional question. Nor
was it necessary for me talk, as
Mr. Dobbs is not hampered in facility
of speech.
He began by extolling the virtues
of the manufacturer of Coca-Cola, Mr.
Asa G. Candler, of Atlanta, Ga.: “It
would be impossible for so high
minded a man to make and sell a
beverage that contained the least pos
sible danger of a drug habit. Why,
he gives largely to missions and
schools,” etc., etc. It made me think
of something Macaulay says about
Charles I of England. When Charles’
subversion of the right of the Eng
lish people was spoken of, his de
fenders would say, “Yes, but he is
true to his marital vows,” or “He is
kind to his child.” Giving to mis
sions is small atonement for adver
tising for years a coca beverage.
Mr. Dobbs said that Mr. Candler
was not the originator; that it began
as a “patent” medicine; was sold to
Mr. Candler, and he advertised it as
a beverage; that the great success
achieved by the company had made
it many enemies, and graft and black
mail had repeatedly been tried upon
it by men in different State legisla
tures; that the company now had
eight factories in different places, and
fifty-three salesmen.
It seemed evident that the general
public had never heard much about
the suit against the United States
government by the Coca-Cola com
pany for rebate of “patent” medicine
tax until I sent out a leaflet some
time ago giving the information that
it was admitted at that trial that
there was a small quantity of cocaine
in Coca-Cola. Mr. Dobbs had a copy
of the leaflet in his possession and
he acted as if he did not really like
it. As he shook the little leaflet up
and down in his hand, he said, “Do
you suppose we would give poison to
our own children? My children
drink Coca-Cola; if it had poison in
it, do you think I would let them
have it?” And much more. When
I had a chance to speak, I said:
“The leaflet nowhere mentions poi
son.” Then I said something about
the report of that trial having
been in the Druggists’ Circular.
That name caused what appeared
like unto an ebullition of tem
per. He said, “Oh, that’s where
you got it, eh? That dirty little
sheet!” Then he paid his respects
to “that H. J. Schnell” in a string
of adjectives which have escaped my
memory, but they were not compli
mentary. This I do remember clear
ly: he said that you were “down on”
them because they would not adver
tise with you; that you said, “Ad
vertise with us, and we will let up
on you.” I told him that I had the
same information from authorities at
Washington. He said he had learned
in Washington that it was the W. C.
T. U. and the brewers who were stir
ring up the trouble there about Coca-
Cola, and that the order prohibiting
the sale of Coca-Cola to the soldiers
at the army posts would soon be re
scinded, because that beverage now
absolutely contains no cocaine.*
He asked me to take his word as
an honest man that it does not now
contain any cocaine. I said: “But
years ago you declared it contained
no cocaine, yet when a government
chemist found the cocaine you were
obliged in a court of law to admit
its presence.” He said, “We did not
know there was any cocaine in it un
til that trial!!” As Mr. Candler,
the proprietor, is a druggist, this
statement of ignorance of the nature
of coca is beyond belief.
Mr. Dobbs said that the suit
against the government was begun in
1902 and ran along through 1903,
and that when it developed that there
was cocaine in Coca-Cola Mr. Candler
declared if his product could not be
made without cocaine they would
cease to make it. Consequently they
had interviewed chemists in New
York (Dr. Eccles** and Dr. Louis
Schaeffer, he named) as to a method
by which they could extract the flavor
from coca leaves without taking out
any of the cocaine. This method, he
says, they are now using, and they
have a'"factory at Maywood, N. J.,
where they make the coca extract.
He said it costs them $25,000 a year
to keep the cocaine. He also said
that most of their caffeine is taken
from tea.
I asked why they used coca leaves
if they do not want the cocaine. He
said they must use them to retain the
right to the trade name, and that they
wanted the flavor of the leaves in the
drink.
With the flavor only of the leaves,
and with the caffeine taken from tea,
how truthful is the advertisement
which says, “To the invigorating
properties of the coca leaf are added
the sustaining qualities of the kola
nut!”
I believe that Mr. Dobbs was per
fectly truthful in stating that cocaine
has been eliminated from Coca-Cola.
Indeed it could not well be otherwise
now under the pure food regulations
and with the anti-cocaine laws of
some of the States. Even Vin Mari
ani has been obliged to change in or
der to be on sale now in the State
of New York.
Yet, even with the elimination of
cocaine, Coca-Cola does not seem to
be a harmless drink. The chemists
whose analyses are sent out by the
company manufacturing this bever
age nearly all say it is as harmless
as tea or coffee. Yet physicians and
druggists have told W. C. T. U. work
ers that they know of people who
Jeffersonian
have become so addicted to the use of
Coca-Cola that they could not be re
strained from taking it, and its effect
upon them was injurious. One case
related to me within a day or two
was a lad whose father said he had
become worthless in school or any
where else because of his addiction
to Coca-Cola.
ISIr. Samuel Hopkins Adams was re
ferred to by Mr. Dobbs as having
been sent to Georgia by Collier’s
Weekly to study Coca-Cola. Mr.
Dobbs said that Mr. Adams could not
find any one in Georgia who had been
injured by this drink. I wrote to
Mr. Adams about this and received
the following reply:
“Mr. Dobbs has used my name not
only without authority, but in away
to produce a false impression. What
I reported to Collier’s was that I was
convinced that Coca-Cola does not
contain cocaine. I do most emphat
ically believe that it produces a habit,
not so pronounced, indeed, as alcohol,
or morphine addiction, but neverthe
less baneful and difficult to break.
There is too much smoke not to indi
cate some fire, and I hear from all
parts of the South, both by letter and
personal interviews, of cases where
the addict must have his fifteen or
twenty glasses of “dope” (the South
ern term for Coca-Cola) per day.
“I hope most sincerely that your
organization will not, either explicitly
or by implication, gtve Coca-Cola ‘a
clean bill of health.’
“You are at liberty to use this let
ter as you see fit.”
It is certainly true that some very
good authorities have said that caf
feine as a drug may lead to impaired
digestion and to nervous disorders.
Dr. Harvey W. Wiley is now mak
ing investigation of Coca-Cola and
some other soft drinks, and within a
few months we shall, no doubt, have
his conclusions. ***
Meanwhile, will druggists favor
the writer by sending her brief re
ports of cases of Coca-Cola addiction
which have come under their notice?
Names of writers will not be pub
lished or mentioned without their
consent.
If the beverage is really making
drug habitues of children, good drug
gists will not want to sell it, and the
public should be warned against it.

***What Dr. Harvey W. Wiley, of
the Department of Agriculture, thinks
of caffeine beverages may be gather
ed from his remarks before the Dis
trict of Columbia Woman’s Organ
ization of the N. A. R. D., reported
in our news department this month.
—Editor the Druggists’ Circular.
(There is one point in the forego
ing letter that we can not allow to
pass unchallenged, as to do so might
create an erroneous impression as to
the character of the Druggists’ Cir
cular. Mrs. Allen, whose veracity we
assume will not be questioned, writes
that Mr. Dobbs said to her that Mr.
Schnell, who is the manager of the
Druggists’ Circular, had said to him,
“Advertise with us, and we will let
up on you.” Upon receipt of Mrs.
Allen’s letter we wrote to Mr. Dobbs
that any such statement concerning
the Druggists’ Circular or its mana
ger, was “unqualifiedly false,” and we
hereby repeat and emphasize our
statement, and challenge Mr. Dobbs
or any one else to produce one scin
tilla of evidence in substantiation of
his charge. Mrs. Allen invited Mr.
Dobbs to repeat his charge in writ
ing, but he declined to do so, writing
instead that she had “misunder
stood” his statement —a high trib
ute, indeed, to the intelligence of
a very active and wide-awake woman!
This reduces this phase of the matter
to a question of veracity between
Mrs. Allen and Mr. Dobbs, and every
one is entitled to make his own
choice as to which one he will be
lieve.
Now, let’s see whether the Circular
is “down on” Coca-Cola or the com
pany which manufactures it. Look
ing back over our indexes for the 1
past twenty years, we find —prior to 1
this year—just three references to
Coca-Cola. A note in the number for ]
January, 1904, page 16, in reply to 1
a query from a subscriber, reads: fl
“No formula has been published!
for this preparation so far as we caifl
learn, but if the name be taken afl
its apparent meaning, it is obtaine-.l
from coca leaves and kola nuts, tbfl
active principle of the former beirfl
cocaine and the latter caffeine. Tlfl
preparation is said to act as a str or. J
stimulant; and such action would, fl
course, result from the use of the,fl
drugs.” fl
The next note, in reply to a query
from a subscriber, is in the issue for (
June, 1905, page 191. In this note
we give practically the same infor
mation as is contained in the former’
one.
The third and last note appears in
the number for January, 1906, page
15, and is principally a quotation
irom the brief of the attorney for the
Coca-Cola Company in the litigation
it had with the United States inter
nal revenue department about cer
tain taxes, referred to by Mrs. Allen.
In this brief the attorney said: “So
far as the presence of cocaine is con
cerned, in one glass of Coca-Cola
there is 1-400 of 1 grain.”
This brings us down to tile present
year. In the April issue, page 307, in
reply to a query from a subscriber,
we gave an abstract of the essential
features of the previous quotation
from the Coca-Cola attorney’s brief,
and in doing so inadvertently stated
that the attorney had said that one
per cent, of alcohol was used as a
preservative, when what he really
said was one-half of one per cent.
This error, as slight as it was, was, in
the interest of accuracy and entire
fairness to all concerned, corrected
in the Circular for the next month,
on page 365.
A short time after the appearance
of our April issue we received a let
ter from Mr. Dobbs, the body of
