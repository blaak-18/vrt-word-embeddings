Now that the liquor business of F
South Carolina has been turned a

If every community had the pow- d

The press of the State have been
agitating questions of reform that
should engage the attention of the
memubers of the general assembly at
their next sitting.
SFirst of all, a railroad commission
d should be provided. This is a pres
- sing need, especially to the people of
this section, who are at the com
jplete mercy, and have felt the op
pressive hand of the most audacious
and soulless monopoly in the State.
The legislature should, also, pass a
law prohibiting members of that
body from accepting free passes
from the railroads. It should pass
a law against miscegenation. The
revision of the criminal laws is an
other matter of much importance.
It should abolish the expensive court
of appeals, which is simply a haven
for a few old political hacks. It
should prohibit the debasing and
degrading prize fighting. It should
abolish the present inhuman con
vict lease system. It' should make
the carrying of concealed weapons
a felony punishable by imprison
ment at hard labor, and adopt the
most stringent measures for its en
forcement. There is other legisla
tion needed,- but should the legisla
ture only adopt measures covering
_ the subjects we have enumerated,
_ they will have done good and faith
ful work.
STIE ELECTION MUDDLE.
An old tar on one of his voyages
to the Pacific Ocean islands had
pickcd up a parrot and taught it to
speak. In course of time his vessel
landed at San Francisco for a brief
stay. The tar, with his bird, being
on shore enjoying the sights de
cided to attend one of the numerous
play houses that flourished at the
time-1849.
The hall upstairs had been turned
into a Temple of Thespis, while the
lower floor was occupied by one of
those shops that sold "a little of
everything," and particularly that
staple article of pioneer days--gun
powder.
The old tar "hoved into" the
the theatre and took his seat. At
that epoch in the history of the city
the proprieties of politeness were
not strictly regarded, in fact every
one's conduct was regulated on the
free and easy plan so the tar
filled up and lit his pipe, and leaned
back in his chair preparatory to en
joying the play.
The first scene interested him
very much, so much so that he could
not help exclaiming: "Well, I won
der what is going to come next,"
and, the parrot, of course, repeated
the query. This was repeated af
ter several scenes, until, finally, be
coming so thoroughly absorbed in
the play, he accidently dropped his
clay pipe on the floor, it broke and
scattered the ashes. There hap
pened to be a crack in the floor,
and a live coal from the ashes fell
through and dropped into a can of
gunpowder. A terrible explosion
followed. The poor parrot was
blown over into the adjoining coun
try, alighted on a rail fence, and
plaintively queried: "Well, I won
der what is going to come next."
The Gazette, in regard to the out
come of the municipal election, is
in pretty much the same predica
ment. It has endeavored to be au
fail, but in its groping about for in
formation it has failed to "catch on"
to the smallest straw, and all it can
do now, is to simply "wonder what
is going to come next."
PR ODIGIO US. t
The World's Fair is opened-the
opening, according to all reports,
was prodigious, like the Fair, butI
the spectacle abounded in rawness t
and ragged edges. The President,
on May z, by pressing the button
set a mass of machinery in motion, e
and formally announced that the i
Fair was opened, but this was ac
formality pure and simple,since there c
is no complete Fair, as yet, and
it is doubtful, so reports assert, if
there will be before June. Tlhere i
are many unfinished buildings, thei
promise of a really great Exposition I
but as the Boston Traveler notes, I
but as yet a promise unfulfilled.
The Fair is certain to be a suc- x
cess, but what it wants is time. 1
During the middle of June every
thing will have been completed, and
would be best time to visit the Fair.
THE GO I'RArOR A NVD TIIE
PRIESlDENT.
New York Sn.
Gov. Pennoyer, of Oregon, is
justly criticized for the tone of his i
telegraghic reply to Mr. Cleveland's I
message of May 3. The President t
through Mr. Gresham, "earnestly t
hoped" that th" Governor would
look sharp dftf the execution of i
the laws ~Qregon in so far as they .v
afford potect.i.n to the Chine.se"
I I will attend to-,mny business," re
t pliedtiPennoyer; "let the President
e attend to his."
t - This i# curt, even for a telegra
phic dispatch. Gov. Pennoyerpro
a bably desired to keep his dispatch
- down as close as possible to the
f ten-word limit, and thus to save to
- the treasury of Oregon extra rates
,on a message sent in reply to what
s he regarded as an unnecessary ad
monition to him to do his duty in
a his own field of authority. Judged
,t by the standard amenities of4 pcial
s intercourse, the Pennoyer dispatch
s to Mr. Cleveland might be improved
e in phraseology. It shows temper.
But as a direct and energetic
statement of the constitutional re
*. lations between ihe Chief Executive
n of the Federal government and the
t Chief Magistrate of one of the
i States of the Union Pennoyer's
j reply to Mr. Cleveland is unexcep
tionable. Is is not often that a
e dozen words convey a greater cons
E titutional truth, or a sounder decla
- ration of purpose. - If Mr, Cleve
e land had received from Gov. Pen
- noyer a dispatch urging him to do
- his plain duty in a matter entirely
- within the President's province, and
g entirely outside of the province of
the Governor of Oregon, and if the
- President had telegraphed: "I will
attend to my business; let the Gov
vernor of Oregon attend to his." It ts
quite conceivable that some people
s might regard the answer from Wash
I ington as an epigrammatic rebuke
, and an assertion of official dignity
I worthy of a place in history. It
f would certainly be an impertinence
for Gov. Pennoyer to assume that
Mr. Cleveland was not wide awake
s to the duties of his own office, or
that he did not intend to enforce to
the best of his ability the laws
I which he had sworn to execute.
Gov. Pennoyer might have been
f more polite. Barring considera
f tions of taste, he could not have
t expressed with greater force or in
fewer words, the fundamental idea
upon which this Union of States
was constructed and still exists.
BA TTER Y B.
WV. H. Beanham of New Orleans,
recently a visitor in Washington, is
captain of Battery B of the Louis
iana Field Artillery,which has a re
markable record in the way of salu
tes. This battery fired the first
salute that was ever fired in honor
of little Miss Ruth. When Mr.
Cleveland went to Louisiana to visit
Joseph Jefferson, the Mayor of New
Orleans entertained the then ex
President, and Battery B had out
its guns to salute him. When that
ceremony was over, Captain Bean
ham requested Mr. Cleveland's per
mission to fire a salute in honor of
his little daughter. Mr. Cleveland i
consented, and added laughingly
that he only wished she had been
there herself to enjoy the honor.
Captain Beanh am figured out that
as the code specified no fixed salute <
for the case in hand, eleven guns t
would be a suitable number, and '
this unique salute was promptly
fired.
Battery B was the only one out
of the fifty thousand troops that t
took part in the Washington Cen- I
tennial procession which recognized
Mr. and Mrs. Cleveland with a r
marching salute. - Kate Field's

GAMBLING IN GRAIN.
Closing an editorial on "Com
mercial Exchanges and Gambling,"
the Western Rural uses this lan-b
guage: b
The fact that this innovation
crept so quietly and gradually into e
legitimate business that it has grown e
until the national banks are the be
neficiaries to a point where the mo
ral sense of the owners of such ins- ri
titutions is dulled by the pecuniary N
emoluments gained by the system,
is an all poweful argument in favor T
of its abolition. Every logical de
duction shows conclusively that the
meddling in trade and speculation c
by this enormous and potent aggre
gate of gambling capital, is wasteful C
in a national sense, and depresses F
in a like measure the value of food
products, so dealt in. The pecu
niary side of the question, however,
is of secondary importance.
Gambling is a crime or misde
meanor by statutory law, and, its
votaries are social outcasts in all ci
vilized communities. This same
festering evil has its clutch upon
the legitimate commerce of a nation tt
and so entrenched through its al
forced connection with the machin- P
ery of commerce, and the vast ag
gregate of capital kept in the hands -
of banking institutions that they,
fearful of losing sb large a perquis
ite, unite in trying to prevent pro
posed restrictive legislation. Lit
tle wonder that the plain people of
the nation, in the midst of a mone- E
tary problem, turn with suspicion
from the view of those institutions, H
,hose opinions should imbue them
with confidence, when it is clearly le
demonstrated that they hold illicit
pecuniary emoluments above the
desire forogeneral prosperity'or com
mercial 'honesty.
A CROWDED PROFESSION.
New Orleans Picayune. _
h The harvesting of the annual crop
e of young physicians, which comes
o to maturity about this time of the
s year, has aroused the curious statis
t tician to do some figuring on their
L- prospects. He says that there are
a educated in this country about twice
d as many clergymen as lawyers3 and
il about twice as many physicians as
h lawyers, which makes about four
d physicians to every lawyer. The
United States has more physicians
c to the population than any other
country. In x88o there was a phy
e sician to every 6oo inhabitants,
e whereas in England there was one
e physician to every zooo, in France
s one to every 2600 and in Germany
- one to s8oo, In certain parts of the
a United States the doctors were even
more plentiful than the ratio for the
whole country indicated. Ten years
ago, according to a report of the
L- Illinois board of health, there was
o one doctor to 458 persons, and in
y smaller places in the State one to
d z6o. In 1887-8 the entire number
.f of medical students in this country
e was 18,513 (including dental, phar
L1 maceutical and veterinary,) and
the total is now supposed to be
s about 2o,ooo. On the basis of this
e rapid increase, it is safe to say that
- the circle of the average physician's
e patients is closing in on him every
y year, and if he is improving their
t health steadily, the putlook for him
e is anything but cheerful.
TIlE HlOG IZV TIHE SO7TTH.
r The following excellent piece of
, advice is taken from the Cincinnati I
s Tribune.
"'The devotion of Southern far
mers to the one crop idea has been
shaken a little the past year under
the advice of farm journals and Al
e liance leaders. The habit of gene
a rations has been to center every
a thing on cotton. Necessary farm
s supplies are bought in the North, 1
the cost of long transportation be
ing added to the proper piece. Ba
con and pork are shipped from Iowa E
and Illinois to Alabama and Missis
sippi, and hay from Indiana and
Ohio. Even corn is imported into
districts where local conditions are
peculiarly favorable for corn rais
ing. The very low price of cotton
which has prevailed favorable until
recently has shaken the system of
r credits under which these supplies
have been purchased by mortgag
ing future crops at enormous rates
of interest. The farmers have been
forced in consequence- into raising .
their own supplies to some extent.
The result is the discovery that
cheaper cotton can be made with
home-raised supplies than with the
products of Northern farms im- a
ported at heavy cost. It is hoped
that the lesson will be heeded in
next year's planting. A reduction
of the area of eacli farm devoted to
cotton and an increase of that de- l
voted to corn, hay, hogs and other
diversified farm products will tend
to increase the market price of the
cotton staple, while, at the same time
the cost of raising it is reduced. If
our Southern friends wish to get out
of the clutches of the money sharks,
let them raise hogs,."
A German journal states that in
tl% year 1889 the quantity of cotton
produced in the world amounted to
I ,4oo0ooo bales, whilst in 187o it
reached only 6,200,000 bales.
