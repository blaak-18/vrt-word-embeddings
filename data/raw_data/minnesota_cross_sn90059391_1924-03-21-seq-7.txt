STATE FORESTER
BLAMED FOR 1918
MOOSE LAKE FIRE
Governor Preus of Minne
sota Accuses W. T. Cox
In Duluth Speech
LOSS WAS $60,000,000
Railroads Were Not Prosecuted
For Failure to Maintain
Patrolmen
DVLUTH, MINN., March s.—Rail
roads caused the $60,000,000 Mp°;jf
Lake fire in October, 1913, and W. T.
Cox, former state forester, was
blamed by Governor Preus for not
Srosecuting the railroads, in an aa
ress delivered today to a gathering
of forest rangers.
The governor asserted that Mr. Cox,
at the time of the fire, attempted to
lay the blame on the legislature for
not making a sufficient large ap
propriation in 1917 to enable him to
fight forest fires.
Despite a wave of protest, Gover
nor Preus removed Mr. Cox, recog
as one of the foremost forest
conservationists in the country be
cause Mr. Cox refused to accede to
the wishes of the timber interests.
Interests Get Voice
The governor accomplished the re
moval of Mr. Cox by placing on the
forestry board members whose in
terests were with the timber inter
ests rather than with forest conser
vation.
The governor’s statement, in which
he seeks to shift the responsibility
upon Mr. Cox, follows in part:
“On the twelfth day of October in
1918 I was in Duluth. Smoke was
filling the city. Evening came and
the city just barely escaped destruc-

tion by fire. The following morning
we had the announcement of the
most dreadful fire in the history of
the state.
“I proceeded to Moose Lake, where
a great effort was being put forth to
save people. Every hour brought re
ports of those who had been burned
to death. Never shall I forget one
burial of 185 charred bodies along the
roadside at Moose Lake. Never has
so profound an impression been made
upon me of the helplessness of hu
man effort struggling with the ele
ments.
“Instantly, the question came.
‘What was the cause of the fire?'
The forester, who was the employe
of your board, issued at Federal Dam
to the press a statement in which he
said: *The men of the legislature
who cut our appropriation from $160,-
000 to $40,000, or $60,000, are directly
responsible for the death roll in the
woods.’
“Members of the legislature were
charged by the executive officer of
your board directly with the destruc
tion of $60,000,000 worth of property
and the lives of 453 human beings.
No more cruel, no more false accusa
tion could have been made.
Upholds Legislature
“The legislature had cut the appro
priations of your department from
$85,000 a year to $40,000, in 1917 for
the reason that the money which had
been appropriated had in part been
utilized for political propaganda in
the election of 1914 in passing a con
stitutional amendment known as
amendment No. 9. Furthermore,
your department was not putting
forth the efforts required by law to
S revent the great cataclysm of 1918.
ection 3795 G. S. 1913, reads as fol
lows, ‘When in the judgment of the
state forester there is danger of fires
from locomotive“fengines, he shall or
der any railroad company to provide
patrolmen to follow each train
throughout such fire patrol district.
When the state forester has given a
railroad company notice to provide
such patrol, the said railway com
pany shall immediately comply, and
upon its failure so to do, the state
forester may employ patrolmen to
patrol the rights-of-way of said rail
road, and the expenses of the same
shall be charged to the said railroad
company and in addition thereto, the
said company shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor.’
“Why did your department not en
force this statute? You ask me, was
the fire set by locomotives the prin
cipal cause of the Moose Lake fire?
You have but to consult the court
records of the fifty or sixty million
dollars’ worth of damage done in that
catastrophe.
“The law was not enforced in that
year. One man alone devoted part
of his time to checking up locomotives
as provided in Section 3796, providing
for spark arresters and ash pans, but
there is not a single piece of evi
dence wherein your forestry depart
ment employed men to patrol the
railroad tracks.
“There were no prosecutions in
that year of railroad men who vio
lated the law although the law in
that year was most notoriously vio
lated. Seven days before the Moose
Lake fire, the Soo line was requested
to employ 10 men to patrol the for
est area which they traversed. John
McLaren, the national forest exam
iner, in his report entitled ‘The Great
Minnesota Fire,’ made October 30,
1918, states on page 29, ‘the region
which was fire swept, as I was told by
State Forester Cox, has a normal pre
cipitation of from 14 to 20 incnes,
but this year only about four inches
had fallen.’
“In view of this knowledge in your
department, you should have had em
ployes capable of coping with the
situation and compelling the railroad
companies to obev the law. Had Sec
tions 3795 and 3796, Gen. Stat. 1913,
been rigidly enforced by the forest
ry department, whose specific duty it
was to enforce them, the great forest
fire of that year would not have
claimed the lives of 453 citizens and
destroyed $60,000,000 of property.
This board and its employes should
see in the future that these laws are
enforced.
“I would urge upon this board that
the tenure and personnel of the for
est rangers be made as permanent as
possible. The training which you
gentlemen have had in the past con
stitutes you the best employes for
your positions.”

Norwegian Novelist Pays
Debt Contracted 40 Years
Ago When in Minnesota
FORTY years ago, a penniless im
migrant, a failure at every iob
he tried in Minneapolis, his
health failing and his high hopes
shattered, borrowed S4O.
Recently word came to Minneapo
lis that Knut Hamsun, most famous
Norwegian novelist, has paid his debt
at last, 40 years from tne day when
he was the penniless immigrant who
needed the money to ward off death
itself.
Back of that brief statement is a
long story—the story of the intense
youth who came to the northwest,
planning to write great poetry to he
read by the Norwegians in America,
who was discharged from a job as a
bricklayer and later failed as a
preacher in Minneapolis, who tried to
give a lecture tour with the admis
sion price set at 10 cents per per
son. and failed; who failed by turn
at everything he tried, until he went
back to Norway and began the writ
ing that has made him famous.
H. M. Johnston met Hamsun when
the young Norwegian was clerk in a
store owned by John Hart at Elroy,
Wisconsin. He had gone there on the
suggestion of Professor Rasmus B.
Anderson of the University of Wis
consin.
Gave l T p Lecture Tour
“Hamsun had it in mind to try a
lecture tour in Wisconsin, but some
how his talk, after he had prepared
it, did not carry much of an appeal
to the people of the state, and he was
obliged to give up the idea.” Mr.
Johnston said. “I was teaching in
village school there, and used to give
him lessons in English during the
winter evenings.
“About this time, he fell ill. and
MANY ENDORSE TOWNER-STERLING BILL
WHICH CALLS FOR FEDERAL DEPARTMENT
“I know of no more potent influ
ence or effective service that could
be rendered education in all parts of
the country than the enactment by
congress of a measure similar to the
Towner-Sterling bill. A department
of education in the national govern
ment would afford a unifying influ
ence throughout the land which would
stablize and promote educational ac
tivities in every state in the union
and would in no way interfere with
well-established state or local rights
and privileges or decrease or minim
ize the influence of a single state in
its educational affairs,” declared Dr.
Thomas E. Finegan, commisioner
of education, commonwealth of Penn
sylvania.
“Time after time when I have en
deavored to promote some education
al reform within my official pro
vince, or to effect legislative results
which would improve the opportuni
ties of boys and girls, I have felt the
need of the power and influence
which can be supplied through a fed
eral department of education,” he
continued. “Having a viewpoint of
the state administrator, as I have
worked in such capacity all my life,
I have no fears whatever of a nation
al department of education inter
fering with the prerogatives of a
state office responsible for the sup
ervision of education in a state or of
decreasing the influence of such of
ficer with his state constituents. On
the other hand, I believe such a de-
Sartment would increase greatly the
ignity, the power for usefulness and
the prestige in every way of an offi
cial responsible for the leadership of
education in one of our American
states. As the National Education
association itself has influenced the
professional side of education in ev
ery section and corner of the land
so would a national department of
education influence the legal, the
constitutional, the financial, the offi
cial side of public education not on
ly in every state and school district
of the country, but also in the eyes
of the world.
“Each state and the nation itself
roust join in giving to every boy and
girl in the land the opportunity of
obtaining the education which will
best fit them for the service of the
republic.'’
Mrs. Robert E. Speer, president,
national board of the Young Wo
men’s Christian association, stated
her position in the following words:
“Believing that the development of
personality Is the goal of all educa
tion, the association’s program is
based on education, to the end that
young women may be able to adapt
themselves to their social environ
ment, to appreciate the world In
which they live, and to become in
telligent and creative citizens In the

able to be up, with a request for

sist him in going to Colorado to re*-
cuperate.”
He went back to Norway. He came
back to America again, to work in a
threshing gang in North Dakota, to
spend a winter in Minnesota logging
camps, to run a street car in Chicago.
Then, in 1888, he went back to Nor
way. and “Hunger,” his greatest suc
cess, followed.
Friends Surprised
Picture the surprise of his old
friends in Elroy, and picture the
greater surprise of H. M. Johnston,
who wrote to Hamsun, congratulating
him on his winning of the Nobel
prize three years ago. and received
this reply.
“Not able to correspond, poor
health, unable to work with pen.
Have tried during 20 or 30 years to
find your address, even through South
America. You have perhaps been
moving. Someone told me that you
were living in Eau Claire. I wrote
to Eau Claire, but you were not to
be found. Long ago. I got a letter
from Silver Hage. Madelia (Minn.),
lumberman of that time. I answered
him that I was owing you some mon
ey, but he did not give me your ad
dress. Queer, indeed, our earth is
not very large, but you, I could not
find.
“1 now let a money bank in Chris
tiana send you a check on my debt.
You will, I hope, receive it a few
days after this letter. I thank you.
Mr. Johnston, for your help and your
kindness. . . .”
The check was for S4O, plus many
times the interest due.
social order of their day. Therefore,
the Y. W. C. A is particularly glad
to see education come to be consid
ered as one of the major interests of
our national life, and to see adequate
provision made therefor in our local
and national budgets.
“The provision for research in edu
cation is one of our greatest needs
today, and should lead us forth into
new ways of enriching the life of our
people as well as the lives of others.
"As a nation we are striving to
achieve democracy. This may only
he done by building on the founda
tion of an educated citizenry. We
cannot look with complacency upon
the changing forms of our social life
so long as their growth and stability
are menaoed by illiteracy, and the
bitterness of soul which comes from
lack of opportunity to find one’s self
in unselfish service. All of these
things are problems of education
which alone can insure the creation
of a sane, intelligent public opinion
which shall not become the tool of
half-truths nor of propaganda.”
“Education is just as important to
our national life as commerce, agri
culture, labor, or the army,” was the
assertion of J. T. Jennings, president.
American Library association. “Not
until it is »o recognized by placing
a secretary in the president’s cabi
net will it have the attention neces
saary to its development. Schools and
libraries have for years found it nec
essary to spend part of their
strength in fighting an apathetic
public for support, and in experimen
tation and research which should be
done by a central government de
partment. With public attention
focused upon education, our schools
and libraries will develop greater ef
ficiency in bringing adequate educa
tional opportunities to all our citi
zens.”

FLAMING CIRCLE RIOT
SUPPRESSED AT START
Glenn Young: in Full Aeconl
With Action of Federal
Grand Jury
MARION, ILL., March 15. —Glenn
Young, federal prohibition law en
forcement officer, who was the cen
ter of the clean-up in Williamson
county, Illinois, was in this city re
cently.
As soon as it was learned that
Young was in town, the word was
spread to the Faming Circle, the
anti-Klan organization for bootleg
gers and law breakers in general.
The gang which is opposed to law
and order met at Murphysboro and
resolved to start on a clean-up be
ginning at Marion. They left Mur
physboro and as their cars were going
through Carbondale, the chief of po
lice of that city phoned Chief of
Police Thomas Boyd of Marion to be
on the lookout. The sheriff was noti
fied and word sent to Herrin. Hugh
Willis, under instructions from Sher
iff Galligan, requested that part of
the troops stationed there proceed
to Marion It was told that the ob
jective point of the Flaming Circle
was Whiteside’s garage on North
Market street, where Mr. Young
sometimes puts in part of his time.
As the word scattered about Marion
that the Flaming Circle was on its
way to Marion to get Glenn Young
and dynamite Whitesides’ garage,
several hundred patriotic American
citizens gathered and volunteered
their services to guard the place.
Upon the arrival of the soldiers they
marched about the square a few
times and went to the garage. As
sisted by the citizens who volunteered
help, a guard was placed about the
garage. It is said there were several
hundred guns in the crowd and that
four machine guns were planted at
convenient places. Several of the
guards occupied places on the roof
of neighboring houses. Evidently
word was received by the Flaming
Circle that a warm reception was
waiting for them here, as they dis
banded shortly after passing through
Herrin.. Prompt action by the chief
of police at Carbondale served to
place Marion on its guard and the
efficient work of Chief of Police
Boyd and his assistants was the
means of everything being ready
here for the invaders when they
should arrive.
Glenn Young was seen by a news
paper representative and seemed
quite happy. He answered such
questions as were asked him and
gave expression to his attitude
throughout the investigation at Dan
ville. First, he said that he was in
perfect harmony with the federal of
ficers and the federal grand jury in
all they did. He had never been dis
armed or requested to disarm except
by the Sheriff of Danville, and as
soon as Young showed him his high
authority for carrying arms, the re
quest was withdrawn. And as for
the statement made through the
press reports that he had called the
federal grand jury a “gang of boot
leggers.” he had never made any such
expression. All he said was that two
of the members of the jury had been
arrested some time ago for bootleg
ging. The story of wholesale con
demnation grew from that state
ment. He asserted positively that
the feeling between nim and the
federal officers and grand jury were
harmonious in every particular. He
satisfied them of his authority to
conduct the raids, and that was suf
ficient. They accepted his evidence
and the evidence of his witnesses.
British Officials
Religious Idealists
It is maintained that the
Labor party in England owes its sud
den rise to a considerable extent, to
the religious idealism which charac
terizes many of its leaders, and
which has drawn into its ranks an
unprecedented number of the youth
of England. A London daily prints an
appeal from a clergyman for a simi
lar idealism in all parties, which de
clares that “there is a widespread
feeling among the younger members
of the Unionist party that its leaders
must got hack to first principles if
that party is really to win the alle
giance of youth. Never in recent
yeara have high ideals had a bigger
opportunity than they have today.
Whichever political leader convinces
this nation that his program is
hioad-haxed on Christian principles
will not only command a big major
ity but will attract to his standard
the voiceless millions who in obscur
ity and loneliness are waiting for the
dawn.”
American Bible Society
Funds Are Low; Church
Members Urged to Act
“The place of the American Bible
society in the Presbyterian budget
this year is for $92,340. The actual
receipts for the 11 months of the
fiscal year is $30,020, on 32 per cent,"
writes Frank H. Mann, general secre
tary.
“It is our hope that the churches
throughout the communion may do
whatever is possible before the close
of the fiscal year on March 31 to
complete their quota for the Ameri
can Bible society. We do not ask
for more than is apportioned us in
the budget.
“The society is in the budget be
cause there is no other agency of the
church to do Bible work. This socie
ty has been recognized for many
years by the general assembly as its
authorized agency for this essential
work.
“There are still many Presbyterian
churches where these facts have not
been realized or, at least, have not
been acted upon.
“We covet a place in the budget of
every Presbyterian church through
out the country; and if not already
on the budget of your church, we
would appreciate such recognition
before the close of the present fis
cal year.
“We circulate the Scriptures in
more than 175 languages without
note or comment in practically ev
ery country of the world. We do it
in the name of the church and we
turn to the church for support."

HIGH MORAL IDEALS
St. Paul Pnrent-Teaeher Associ

Than Many
ST. PAUL, MINN., March 17.
To break away from being bound
by “th'"gs,” to rise above them and
to attain the idealism that makes
boys and girls into men and women
with resistance enough to withstand
wrong and temptation is the im
mediate goal for which parents and
educators should strive, W. F. Web
ster. superintendent of schools, said
at the annual banquet of the Central
Council of Parents and Teachers asso
ciations. conducted at the Central
Y. M. C. A. on March 6.
“If we have not the nerve to do
this, we are cowards,” Mr. Webster
said. “If we do not do it, there is
no hope that our children will avoid
some of the scandals that are break
ing today.”
Henry J. Bessesen, president of the
council, as chairman of the meeting,
stressed the value of “getting to
gether and exchanging problems and
their solutions and devoting all en
ergies to character building.”
Minneapolis already excelled in
three things he said: Child welfare;
law enforcement for juveniles and a
parent-teacher magazine.
Philip E. Carlson principal of
Roosevelt high school, urged mem
bers to write their representatives at
Washington to support the Sterling-
Reed bill —which provides for a fed
eral bureau of education—now be
fore congress.
Mrs. Bessesen, chairman of the law
enforcement committee, brought out
the point that “parents and teachers
must be willing to appear as wit
nesses against lawbreakers, especial
ly in cases of cigaret selling to min
ors.”
E. E. Williams, principal of the
Glen Lake farm school, said that ev
ery boy at the school—all of them
convicted of stealing- was a cigaret
addict.

St. Louis Lawyer Gives Stirring
Address to Genoa, 111.,
Audience
GENOA, ILL, March 10.—A fiery
cross burning on the outskirts of
town, proclaimed to the citizens of
Genoa, that the Knights of the Ku
Kluz Klan was very much alive in
their city. The fact was further de
monstrated when C. I. Hoy, promin
ent lawyer of St. Louis, Mo., ad
dressed a public gathering of more
than 600 people here on the princi
ples of the Knights of the Klan.
Mr. Hoy sketched very interesting
ly the birth of our nation, and the
nation Washington and his followers
had planned with the people of the
same speech, manners and religion,
compared with the United States at
the present time wherein 41 differ
ent tongues are spoken every day
within its boundaries.
Lincoln said a country half slave
and half free couldn’t stand, while
the Klan holds that a country half
foreign, with foreign ideals, man
ners and speech, cannot stand. The
case of the Bible being taken out of
our public schools was also pleaded
by Mr. Hoy.
That the Klan has some of the best
men in the country, in all walks of
life, rich and poor, in all institu
tions, in congress, in the senate, and
closely related to the cabinet, was
intimated by Mr. Hoy. “Our enemies
have accused us of everything vile
and corrupt, of being murderers, and
even of treason to our country, but
they have never proven a single ac
cusation. The futility of their ef
forts is shown in the fact that while
so much was stirred up in Louisiana
against the Klan, Louisiana now has
a governor who is in sympathy with
the Klan.
