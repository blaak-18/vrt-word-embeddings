The next disturbance will reach the

;tral valleys II to 13, eastern states 14.
I expect this disturbance to pass

this storm wave will not go to very low

11 o'clock Friday, organized by elect
Ing Senator Gorman to his old posi
tion as chairman of the caucus. Thii
Is a permanent place and assures hiu
the occupancy of the Democratic con
ference room, one of the most commo
dious and best located comniittec
rooms in the senate end of the capi
tol. He made a brief speech :n a:;
suming the chair, and the, conferrncr
then proceeded t, other us:.ness
There were present 28 of 33 Demrucra
tic senators Senator Gorman's nom
ination as chairman was suggested b,
Senator Bacon and there was no opp,,
sition to his selection. ,n taking the
chair he thanked the senators toi the
honor conferred but did not make at
extended speech.
The remaining time of ;he e-ssior
was devoted largely to the disc uics::
of the present s:tuation in thoe ena;:
and the necessity for Demccrat.c he
mony and unity of action. Th°r wa
a general feeling that th~ va'n.!ie
caused by the retirement of tho, DIn
ocratic senators from committee
which have to deal with the questions
before the present callel sessicr
should be filled and it was deihde
that the aesignation of the member
of these committees should be mad:
by a steering committee to be appoint
ed by the chairman of the cau'rs, bul
that their selection should later be
ratified by the caucus. The steering
committee for the past congress ha.
numbered only seven members, but
Senator Gorman said that the number
be increased to nine, which was the
number in the days of his previous
chairmanship, and this increase was
decided upon.
Later in the day the steering com.
mittee was named. It consists of Sen
ators Gorman (Md.) Cockrell (Mo.)
Martin (Va), Bacon (Ga.) Dubois
(Idaho), Money (Miss.), Bailey
Tex.), Blackburn (Ky.), and Till
man (S. C.).
The new members on the committee
are Messrs. Gorman, Blackburn and

ficers of the Brotherhood of Firemen

continue loyal to the railroad company
and to their respective organizations
and to pay no attention to the state
ments or threats of any person, nor
to any rumors which may be put in
circulation.
This was the only development of
Friday in the situation. An all day

EXPLOSIONS ENSZTED.
Fully a Score of Lives Wiere post by
the Terrible ('cnession, and the
Uamiler Injured Are Abor:t
Tw ice T'L:at Many.
Olean, N. Y., March 11.-From eight
een to twenty lies waere lost an:l
fully twice that number burned or
bruised by the explosion of oil late
Monday night following the wreck on
the Erie railroad north of this city.
Dwing to the fact that seime of the
bodies were in:n rt'artc. in the fierce
flames, or blown into OlCean creek by
the fierce exalc-iin the exact number
of dead will probably not be known
cfr several days. The number of in
jured, too, is uncertain, as a large
number of them were able to reach
home and receive treatment there. The
known dead are as follows. Norman
Brown, Olean: Johnny Tobin. Olean;
Johnny iMcCready, 0lean; John McMa
hon, 0lean. All four are boys about
sixteen years old. M. V. Drisnoll.
North Olean; Walter Swift. Olean;
John Smeilinger. Olean; Harry God
den, Boardmanville; Richard Connell,
North Olean. Six unidentified bodies
are at Woodward's undertaking rooms.
A boy was blown into Olean creek and
drowned. His body has not been re
covered. Two or more unknown per
sons were incinerated iL the burned
wreckage.
At the hospital one of the patients
said a boy was blown into the creek
near him. He tried to save the lad,
but was unable to do so. The boy
drowned.
The scenes following the explosion
will never be forgotten by those who
saw them. It was about 9 o'clock in
the evening when the train was
wrecked. An Erie freight train west
bonud broke in two on a hill two miles
north of the city.
At first the forward part of the
train, released of all weight of the cars
behind, sprang forward with increased
speed. The brakes were applied and
the front brought almost to a stand
still at the iron bridge across Olean
creek. The rear cars gathering mo
mentum as they came down the hill,
crashed into the forward part of the
train. Most of the cars of the train
were tank cars filled with refined oil
or gasoline. They weighed thousands
of tons, and the impact was terriffic.
One tank car caught fire soon after the
collision. The exact cause of the fire
is not known, but it is supposed to
have started from a spark struck from
grinding pieces of iron in the wreck
age. In a few moments another car of
gasolene caught fire and burst into
flames with a terrific report. Portions
of the iron domes of the cars were
hurled a distance of several hundred
feet. The flames shot high up in the
air, presenting a brilliant spectacle. In
this early accident, so far as can be
learned, no one was injured.
A large crowd quickly gathered.
Hundreds of people from Olean, North
Olean and the surroun:ding country
gathered to watch the brilliant play of
the flames. For two hours people stood
massed together, and as the heat be
came less intense the crowd began to
edge a little closer to the wreckage,
until about 11 o'clock some venture
some boys approached to within a few
hundred feet of the burning debris.
Suddenly there was a terrifle explo
sion. Great masses of white flames
shot hundreds of feet into the air anl
literally rolled down the banked sides
of the track into the gully where
spectators were standing. Men and
boys fell before the wave of white
light to rise no more. Hugt pieces of
iron were hurled through teh air.
mowing down human beings by the
scores. Some managed to scramble to
their feet and get away, but others lay
still in death. A veritable rain of fire
came down upon the crowd. Men and
boys with their clothing a mass of
flames ran shrieking down the track.
some of them falling on the ground
unconscious, while others grovelled in
the ditch or jumped into the creek in
an endeavor so put out the fire from
consuming them. Many of those over
whelmed by the flames dropped where
they stood and never again moved. As
soon as a telephone could be reached
all the doctors in the city were sum
moned and ambulances called out.
