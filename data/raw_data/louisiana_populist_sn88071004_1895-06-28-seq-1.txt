lion. William M. Stewart, senator
from Nevada, delivered an address
before the recent silver convention at
Memphis. Tenn. lie said:
Conventions and the party lash
have thwarted the will of the people
Sfor twenty years. Public plunder, a
venal press and 1),000 banks have
dominated the conventions of all par
ties since the man from luffalo took
charge of the Democratic party. A
majority to do the will of the gold
monopoly has been easily secured in
the conventions of both the old par
ties, and a multiplicity of issues bars
the success of the lopulists. What
are the party names without party
principles? What is the Democratic
party when it repudiates Jefferson
and Jackson and follows John Sher
man? The Democratic masses are
in favor of restoring the money of the
constitution. They are speaking out
in every state, and their voice is
heard with dread by the enemies of
the republic. A very large percentage
of the Republican masses are equal
ly true to the principles of free gov
ernment with the Democratic masses,
but the Republican leaders who wor
ship at the shrine of gold monopoly
are more numerous and powerful than
the Democratic leaders who work
with them to maintain the gold stan
dard.
The people are uniting in every
section of the country to strike for
liberty and recover their lost gov
ernment. The American people have
been betrayed with a kiss for the last
time. They now know that every
man who qualifies his determination
to fight for the free and unlimited
coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to
1 by the United States alone is an en
emy of the cause. All we demand is
the 16 to 1 statutes of 1834 and
1837. There were no 'ifs' and *ands'
about those statutes. There are
none in the creed of a true bimetallist.
The advocates of free coinage at 16to
1 by the United States alone comprise
three-fourths of the voters of the Uni
) ted States. The only hope for gold
monopoly is to divide and conquer.
They have played that game for the
last time. The hearts of the people
are in a common cause, produced by
a common calamity. Whatever poll- I
tiolans and timeservers may do, the
south and west and all lovers of
free institutions everywhere will t
come together and rescue this gov
ernment from the rule of the gold t
kings. The policy of the enemy I
to impoverish the masses is now well
understood. It is well known that I
opportunities create independence
and manhood; that want of opportu
aities creates poverty and cowards. l
One more gold president might do
the work and destroy the foundations
of Republican institutions, which is c
lndependence'and prosperity of the
)people. Thanks to Mr. Cleveland. 1
the purposes of the enemy are dis- I
closed. If the people submit to finan- I
eial bondage and lose their liberty, 1
they will have been warned in time.
The gold standard, falling prices and 1
hard times are as much the policy of i
"8bermaa, Harrison and the great a
mass of the leading Republicans as its
Is of Cleveland himself. The only a
dileraeo is, that Clevelanad proclaims I
epMaly what the hypocrites do a
eretly. I

t country now enjoys was bought.
y President Cleveland contracted with
.c the Rothscbilds combination to cease
n their raids on the United States for
- eight months. The price he paid for
e peace and protection shows the pros
e trate conditions of the people of this
it country before the power of gold mo
.s nopoly He gave them $12,000,000 in
f the difference between the market

ti2,000,000. of United States bonds.
and further agreed, in consideration
of such protection, to allow the com
bination to purchase whatever bonds
Y might be issued before the meeting of
n another congress.
I[ What further proof is required than
this contract to demonstrate that the
gold of the world is cornered? A
v banking corporation contracts to
r change the currents of international
commerce and agrees that no gold
shall be shipped from the United
States for a period of eight months.
How could the Rotbschilds combina
tion perform such a contract and stop
the shipment of gold from America to
Europe,unless they had control of the 1
gold? The goldites proclaim that the
people of this country are entitled to
the best money with the greatest
purchasing power of any money in
the world. 1t hat right have the peo- I
ple to the gold which the combina- 1
tion owns and controls? The people i
now know where the gold is which c
they are told is the only money they
can have.
As long as the standard money of
the Western world is in the hands of
this colossal pool, just so long will
the purchasing power of gold increase
and the price of property decline. i
Great as are the American people, i
unlimited as are the natural resources
of this country, prosperity cannot
come within a larger circulating me
dium than gold alone. The basis of t
the circulating medium cannot be in- c
creased by gold. Both metals would
not be too much, and besides, the
output of gold is substantially con-'
sumed in the arts. The increase of t
population and business is constantly
drawing the cords of contraction i
tighter and tighter around the limbs t
of enterprise. 't
Four-fifths of the American people, r
yea, nine-tenths, have been at heart i
in favor of restoring silver ever since i
the crime of 1873 was discovered. e
but the gold combination has seiz7ed
every avenue of communication. The
press and the telegraph belong to it.
Four thousand national banks are its f
agents, 6t)00 other banks and trusts d
companies do its bidding. Merchants
and boards of trade are dependent i
upon the banks for accommodations
and are clamorous in their praise of t
gold monopoly. Politicians and o!ti
cials, high and low, rely on the money
powers, the press, and the minions of 1
the banks for political success. The
president of the United States places
O30,00) offices at the service of the
money powers for the political or t
other favors he receives. Before such
a foroe any other people would be
powerless: but the American people
mor more than 103 years have met and
eonquered every foe. They have al- A
ways been equal to the emergency. a
ilver was demoaetized by the Re
publicea party, and the leaders of r
that party have labored in season and v
oat of season to keep it demonetized. a
The great .auss of the Democralti n
party previous to the advent of Presi- a
dent Cleveland was in favor of the re- c
peal of the infamous act of 1878, de
Mosxliag ailvert as is shown by t
their uniform votes in both houses of p
congrels. But when the money pow
ersdiscovered Cleveland they found~
an lastrument tothwart the will of
the ismoratiel masses, and they
ained a valuable ally for Sherman r
and Marriso and other active agents p
of the gd staudard. The alarm and
distress eassed by the raid of the ,

1898 ereted a furor whlob amount

(covery of Dr. R. V. Pierce, of Buffalo, '
N. Y., Chief Consulting Physician to

stitute.
e Wvhy shouldn't women use it? Its
e discoverer is a regularly qualified I

I, a life study and a life specialty. His I
t. thirty years' practice in this special '

of specialists have successfully treat- F

has afforded him opportunities en- c
r joyed by no one else for discovering t

e who are scattered all over the globe, ti
r take advantage of that law of which g

is because her inborn modesty causes
her to shrink from the ordeal of sub

Sthe stereotyped "local treatment."
When, finally, torture drives her to il

too often falls into hands that lack w

No woman, who is tired of suffer

It is reported that once upon a

patent ollice for a patent
upon her dimple-producin, pro
c: -s; but, as it was refuted, the
secret is now common property, and
any one who cares to experiment may
try it. Hecr claims were as follows:
Smear a smail spot on the clheek or
e chin with coloriess hilcilac varnish
I. mixed with glue. With a pencil or
- penholder press the flesh with the
point, holding it there until the sub
f stance on tue face becomes dry and
hard. The btiTened indentation thus
retains the exact shape of a dimple,
y and a little face powder carefully
a dusted over the -"artificial dimple"
will completely conceal the varnish
and glue compound. Some care must
r be observed in smiling too suddenly
Sor the dimple may be broken. But
,f with ordinary gentle usage it will re
d tain its pretty shape a whole
evening, if not longer. N hilo
i the dimple process is applicable to
those whose faces comprise a soft.
s velvety or pulpy surface, as then a
e very deceptive dimple can Le pro
t duced, it is not so available for thin
or bony faces, nor where ti.e skin is
very thick and unyielding.
How Mills Was Beaten.
It was Bulwer, was it not, who
s wrote something about women mix
j ing themselves up in all things-in
business, in council, in battle.
1 *"Wherever mischief is astir," said
t Lytton, "there'you may be sure a
1 woman's sly face pleps from her wim
y pie." A writer in a Washington pa
per attempts to prove the truth ol
Bulwer's words by citing a case of re
cent origin. "'Those who remember
the small majority secured by Crisp
over Mills in the Democratic caucus,"
says this writer, "knows that the
former was chosen speaker because
Mrs. Mills expressed doubts during
the Fifty-first congress as to the
glove-like fit of the frocks worn by
the wife of a well-known Missouri
congressman." The writer is right.
It is understood that Mrs. Mills has
since admitted she was mistaken, and
expressed the belief that no woman
was ever more charmingly gowned
than Mrs. Tarsney, wife of the states
man from Kansas City.
An Honest Sergeant
A military story comes from Ire
land. A non-commissioned oflicer.
entering a barrack gate in Dublin,
was mistaken by the "fresh one" on
sentry-go, who immediately saluted
him. The non-commissioned officer,
unaware that his colonel was just be
