The Pharr Meeting. I
With but 5 days notice to adver
tise-not time enough for a single
issue of the local papers-the
Small pox scare and the busy
planting season-all against us,
,., yet the Pharr meeting here was a
. grand success, even in point of
numbers.
g- The large Opera House was well
r filled with white voters, half a doz
p. en ladies and a few colored people.
all filled with enthusiasm and good
will.
The brilliant array of speakers
- were at their best.
M" Judge Taylor Beattie made the
7 first speech, and a most excellent
as one it was.
n, Capt. Pharr followed with some
tb of his happiest hits, proving to
our people the upright, honorable
Scampaign which he has waged all
over the State.
The inimitable Col. H1. S. P. Ash
e by was next, and his speech beg
gaed ?'c *cription, and the audi
enmc went wild with enthusiasm.
Judge A. A. Gunhy then follow
ed in one of the masterly efforts
for which he is famous.
Repeating the charge which
Cor.gressman Boatner made in the
Democratic Committee last Sum
inmer, that not a single man offered
for nomination could carry his home
a parish, and coming to Natchito
e che, he asserted that Cunning
hf am could not carry it, the house
went wild with cheering and de
monstrated the truth of it in no
nucertain tones.
The meeting has settled the par
e ish for Pharr.
- --
Natchitoches Again.
The Times-Democrat, with its
very insignificant "me too," the
r Natchitoches Enterprise, has an
r object lesson on taxation in that
r parish which seems the only thing
in that line it can "point to with
pride" in all this "vast" State.
When we proved that oonfiscato
r1 y taxation had escheated to the
State more than one hundred thou
t sand acres of lands in the parishes
of Rapides, Avoyelles and St.
= Landry alone, the old story of 79
mills Kellogg tax in Natchitoches
parish was the only answer vouch
safed us.
d We explained that the assess
ment in Natchitoches was less than
a $900,000 in Kellogg's (lday and
s that it was now $3,000,000. That
s the State and parish tax then was
21 mills and is now 16. That the
53 mills was levied to pay judg
ments obtained against the parish
by D.'mocratic lawyers and the
mass of which accrued to leading
Democrata
In reply to that the Times-Dem
ocrat gives from the Enterprise a
few isolated instances and a few
cases in which the individual tax
r esare not as great now as then.
The assessment of Natchitoches
parish to-day is three times as
great as it was mnder Kellogg's ad
ministration I Thiis is beyond dis
Spute. How n the name of com
mon arithmetic could the entire
taxation for State and parish pur
pore be lesm now at 18 mills than
the at 91 mills ! If this is not
oter attempt of the liar by the
daytorelieve a liar by the week
at a ad·job, then it is an adtgd
"Iagering" that ought to aske
Auditor Heard feel silly.-Daily

State Platform
eople's Part. of lI., an
1. We arirm our allegiance to
the pure principles of popular gov
ernment, as enunciated by Wash
ington, Jefferson and Jackson, and
embodied in our National platform,
sad we uphold the princi de em
bodied in the immortal declaration
that this should be "a Government
of the people, by the people and
for the people.
S And especially do we de- g
iand the free and unlimited coin- j
ae of both gold and silver, at the a
ratio ot 16 to 1, with equal 'debt
paying power as primary money,
and a full legal tender monetary
sytemfor the people of the Unit
ed States, without consulting any
foreign nation or money syndicate.
8. We demand for Louisiana
industries equal protection to that
aforded the industries of other
States. An American, not a Brit
ish system of commercial laws,
that no diriamination against our
agricultural and iodustrialclasses
may he made.
4. We favor a just and liberal I
system of public schools for the a
beedt of all classes of our people, C
mad we deplore the fact that for
maMy years the managemoent of
our public school system ha been
[. so defective that the. party now in
power seeks to disfr:anchise a i:rl're
number of ouir citizens on the
grounds of ignoirance.
5. We denounce the disarace
ful and infamous election frauds
t. which have prevaile I in Louisiana,
- and we denmnd and are determin
ed to have a perfectly honest and
fair election, at which each citizen
qualified to vote, shall nast his bal
lot freely and secretly, and the
vote shall be fairly counted as they
are actually cast. This is the so
preme issue in this cmnpaign, and
in its siceess the honor, manlhlo1
and prosperity of Louisiana are
involved: The foul and l,:athsomie
methods which have broughrt the
ballot box stuffer to the front, and
l)placed him! in lowver in Luisiaua,
must, in the name of liberty, jug -
tiee, morality and common decen
. cy, be suppressed.
- 6. We oppose and denounce the
t proposed suffrage amendtment, con
cocted by political schemers, not to
purify and elevate the ballot box
but to subserve their selfish pu'r
poses )by providing contra:lictorv
;iualifiudiuith , to .::e'n!: ;i:; difrun
chise large tasses of w(ortlhy citi
zens, by deluding the people witlh
promises of changes in the next
Legislature. We denounce Othe
- wlole amendment as ai vicious
fraud which prol)ses iieasures and
methods that are un-.American and
destructive of free institutions.
7. We favor the utmost econo
- my of expenditures, in State, city
and parish, and pledge our canudi
dates to a strict and impartial en
forcement of all laws, ant the plres
ervation anti promnotion of every
interest in Louisiana, whose wel
- fare is broader and more sacred
y than party lines or partisan poli
cies; and we invite and urge the
true men and honest citizens of
Louisiana, without regard to past
party affiliations to join with us in
_ a noble, patriotic and powverful ef
fort to relieve our lpople and to
elevate the standard of politics
I and public morality in our buloved
State.
