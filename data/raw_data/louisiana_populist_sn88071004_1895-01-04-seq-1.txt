TO THE PRES.
State Bureau of Agriculture,
Baton Rouge, La-, Dec. 7, '94.
We desire to call your attention
to the ninth annual meeting of the
Louisiana State agricultural Society
which will take place at Natchito
ches on January 23, 24 and 25,
1895.
A large and representative body
of planters and farmers of this
State is desired at this meeting.
To accomplish this every agricul
tural organization, including plan
ters' associations, farmers' clubs,
granges and unions are earnestly
requested to send delegates.
The committee on progra-mme
has appealed to the police juries of
the various parishes to send two
or more planters or farmers as del
egates from each parish. Favor
able action of each police jury is
not only most earnestly desired,
but will meet with the honest ap
proval of every friend of agricul
ture.
The present financial condition
of our agriculturists calls for seri
ous thought and deliberation.
Low prices of our staple products,
unreliable labor, soil depletion and
high money rates have deprived
our profession of much of its prof.
ts and all of its pleas rese. Chan
ges in our methods and perhaps
in our crops are imperative, and
what these shall be can be best
determined by the combined wis
dom of assembled conventions of
our leading men. It is therefore
earnestly desired that farmers and
planters from all parts of the State
be present at this meeting and
participate in its deliberations.
The old city of Natchitoehes will
extend its usual hospitality, and
the farmers of Cane river will wel
come their brothers from other por
tions ot the 8tate.
Rtespetfully,
AV. CARTEB,
Commissioner of Agriculture.
FACTS.
The great Republican "Triumph"
November 6, 1894, was won with
the loss of 1,280,000 votes by that
party.
At the same time the Democrat
ic party lost over 2,200,000 votes.
At the same time the Peoples'
party gained 1,340,000 votes or
about 140 per cent. Considering
the votes known to have been
thrown out in Missoari, Kansas,
Nebraska, Alabama, Georgia and
Texas, the latter's gain was over
2,200,000 votes or over 200 per
cent. This is lanitely more than
the infant Republican party, then
representing the People, gained
from 185 to 1864 and yet in 1860
it elected Abraham Lincol and
began making history.

odds with which we had to contend,

tables in the columns of this paler.
had we been given a fair count, in
stead of MIr. Ogden having been
conmnissioned, the commlission
would have boen issued to ourself,
because we duly won it in the con
test of ballots.
This is the people's fight and not
ours.
We made the race against organ
ized Democracy for the cause of
the people and not from our sel
fishness.
We made the fight against the
syndicates and corporations, and
for the re-establishment of justice
and equity.
We fairly won, but was cheated,
swindled, defrauded out of the po
sition, a majority of the people
who actually voted in the election,
of their own free will, and as their
conscience dictated, saidl we should
have.
In order to pur~e the ballot box
es of the fraudulent and illegal
votes, and if possible to rid the
country of the agency that has
honev-comed the institutions of
our commonwealth with corrup
tion of the most degenerate char
acter, and to protect the voter in
his right of sufferage, we have un
dertaken to contest the seat of Mr.
Ogden to the 54th, Congress.
To successfully do this will re
quire The expenditure of some $750
at this end of the line.
Of course the government pays
the expenses of contests of this
character, but not until the case is
finally disposed of.
As we have stated, this is a fight
of the people, and it must be by
their co-operation and unity of ac
tion that they are to succeed.
We are powerless within our
selves.
We appeal to the generous pat
riotism of the sturdy yeomanry of
this district, and of the State, who
are tired of this age of teudal bar
ba ism to come to our assistance
and help us to route and drive
from our borders this hydra-head
ed monster of fraudulent elections.
Thereisno time to.belost. If
you act, you must do it now. The
time is short, and growing shorter.
A strict account will be kept of
all monies received and disbursed.

z:,ns of (':icasian b,lo,d. Some of
them hadi ancestors who fought in
the Revolutionary wsar, and helped
Andrew Jackson whip the English
at New Orleans. Many of them
are veterans of the Mexican war
a war that added an immense ter
ritory to the Union. Nearly all of
the Louisiana Populists who were
old enough, were good Confeder
ate soldiers; and last, but not least
up to a few short years ago they
were enthusiastic Democrats, and
in the dark (days of Radicalism,
when the low land parishes were in
the hands of negroes, and their
carpet hag leaders, it was the pre"
ent Populists of Louisiana who
helped to redeem the State. They
were always willing to defend with
their lives the persons and proper
ty of the low land people, who
were, to a great extent, at tWe mer
cy of the Radical Republicans in
those days. If it had not been for
the white men in the South, who
are now Populists, the Republi
cans would indeed now have
"black heels on white necks."
The Populists, who were former
ly as strong Democrats as they are
now Populists, thought because a
f ýw leaders had gone wrong that
the democratic party was not to be
trusted. They made the mistake
of leaving the party instead of
changing their leaders. Suppose
the Populists should elect men who
did not follow their platform,
would they quit that party and
organize another
The Populists we believe to be
honest in their convictions. They
are battling for what they believe
is best for the people of this land.
They haye been true friends to all
the white people of Louisiana,
when they sorely needed friends,
and they will have to prove their
villiany and rascality before Town
Talk says one word to their dis
paragement. The Town Talk can
not forget old friends, and traduce
them for differing in political mat
ters.-Town Talk.
The Populists.
Immediately after the late elec
tion the general impression pre
vailed that the Populists had suf
fered severely in the battle. They
lost in Kansas and Colorado, two
States in which they seemed so
firmly intrenched mn power tast it
was supposed that they could main
tain their control there for years;
and their strength in the IIouse
was actually less than in the Fity
third Congress. A more careful
study of the election figures, how
ever, proves the first impression to
be an error. The Populists lost
Kansas and Colorado, it is true,
but they gained 600,000 votes over
the very heavy vote they polled in
1892, an improvement of 57 per
cent This sounds more reaona
ble, because the Populists were ex
pected to gain strength on account
of the depression in business, and
there was indeed, every reason
why they did so.
As for their loss of Colorado and
Kansas, which seemed the worst
incident of the eampaign to them
it was rather a personal defei t;fr
Waite and Lewelliug than for tbhe
Populist party. Both of these
Governors had made themselves
objectionable to many persons, and
had aroused great opwosition. It
is a somewhat singular cirer.m
stance that the Populists increased
their vote iu these very States, yet
lost them because of the Democrat
ic suppiort given the Republican
tickets.
It was in the South, however,
that the Populists showed the
greatest strength, and in the two
Carolinas. In Georgia and Texas
they pllled 418,000 votes, defeat
ing the D)euneraey in North Caro
lina and pressing it very close in
the others. In the West also it
was strong, its vote increasing from
22,000 to 138,000) in Texas, from
2'2,000 to 30,0() in Indiana, 21,000
to 35,(40 iu Illinois, 20,000 to 25,
000 in Miclhigan, 29,000 to 88,001)
in Miunesota, 7000 to 15,000 in
Montana, 15,000 to 49,000 in Ohio,
and 10,000 to 27,000 In Wisconsin.
While they seemed to have lost in
the fusion States, like Nebraska,
where the separation of the Demo
crats and Populists was apparent
ly discernible, this is not really so.
The Populists, for instanoe, receiv
ed 80,000 votes in Nebraska, against
83,000 received for the fusion ticket
last year; but the latter vote, it
must be remembered, included the
'emocrats as well as the third par
ty people.
It is this fusion business which
has misled the country and render
ed it difficult to see the wonder
ful growth of the Populists. In 1892
both the older parties were anxions
to form alliances with this new one,
so as to throw the vote away from
their opponents. Thus in the South
the Republicans united with the
Populists to prevent the States
from going Democratic, and in the
West the Democrats made similar
alliances. In the late election
there were but few of these fusion
movements. The Populists-with
the exception oa North Carolina
ran their ewe candidates, and in
some cases fought both of the old
parties. Democratic votes helped
the Republicans in Kansas, and
Republican votes helped the Demo
crats in Texas. The result is that
while the Populists polled a far
larger vote than ever, they elected
fewer of their men.
How will this pat them in the
next campaign, that of 1896 t The
fact that they have gained strength
as rapidly as they have done in the
last two years, with so little organ
ization, renders it probable that
they will continue to gain. Tlhe
Populist sentimentsare very strong
in the South and Vest, and It is
doubtful if they will pass away du
ring the next two years. Even
now the Populists hold the balauce
of power in some dozen States, and
if the same policy of fusion is tried
in 1890 it may possibly threw the
election oft President into Congress.
But the difliculty about the new
party is the lack af hoamogeulty it
possesses. There are Poipulista en
tertaining various beliefa--Popu
hsts like Jones, of Nevada, who
are likely to vote with the Itepub
licans, and Poltfists like those of
Georgia and South Carolina, who
will vote with the l)emocrats. The
new Iparty is somewhat dangerous,
but it would be far more so if it
were fully organized and united.
Times-Demaocrat.
The Discreted Oracles.
Final returns show that the
Wisconsin Populists east 53,$30
votes this year. In 1892 they cast
9,94)9. Figures of this sort rather
shake one's oonidence in the oracle
who proclaims loudly that Popu
liam is dead.-Chicago Times.
