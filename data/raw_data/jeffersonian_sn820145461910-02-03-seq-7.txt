tide, urging the necessity of the
Democratic masses all uniting on
the robber tariff as the sole issue,
which was published in the Atlanta
Constitution on October 25, 1908.
Even the Republicans saw that the
tariff had outlived human endur
ance; so they had an extra session
of Congress, ostensibly to lower the
tariff, but, in reality, to hoodwink
the people a while longer. I notice
that several of our large dailies are
now declaring that the tariff should
have been the issue last year. The
Republicans realized this, in spite of
the stupidity of their opponents.
When, several years ago, Chairman
of the Railroad Commission J. Pope
Brown was pushing his motion to re
duce the passenger rate in Georgia,
although the roads opposed it fierce
ly, my brief to the Commission, sup
porting the motion, was the sole
word from all the citizenry of the
State; in which I urged that the
rate should and must come down.
It did come down.
Just before the people voted upon
the Constitutional amendment, cre
ating our Court of Appeals, I wrote
an article opposing the creation of
that third Supreme Court (we al
ready had two, the two sections of
the Supreme Court), which was also
published in the Atlanta Constitu
tion. Two ex-judges of our superior
courts told me that my article
changed their minds on the subject;
and further stated that had it been
published throughout the State, the
amendment would have been de
feated. I know of several promi
nent lawyers who now say, that the
creation of the court was a blunder.
Too much case law being ground
out, and too many superior courts —
the so-called city courts. I also notice
that one great editor of Georgia
stingingly criticises a recent decis
ion of that Court of Appeals.
Now for the prophetic warning:
The central political thought of to
day is, opposition to monopoly.
For a widely-dirculated newspaper
to shut out of its columns all views
not in accord with its own, is a
most cruel monopoly—monopoliz
ing the molding of public sentiment
—a fearful responsibility. Corpora
tions are buying up leading news
papers for the sole purpose of form
ing public sentiment; when, you
may be sure that all thought critical
of corporations is no longer pub
lished.
Here is the warning: Unless edi
tors cease that narrow and intoler
ant practice of monopolizing the
work of molding public sentiment,
some far-seeing legislator is going
to offer a bill providing for a guar
dian of public sentiment, for each
small publication, and several for
each large paper, whose views shall
be published whenever tendered.
And such bills will pass, too. When
they do, I shall say that their
prophesy was first seen in The Jef
fersonian, over the signature of
EMORY CASON.

A FRIEND WHO DOESN’T DREAD
PERSECUTION.
Dear Sir:—Send the January
number of the Magazine, for I must
have every number of your Maga
zine, and will stand by you through
the fire of persecution, and will fol
low you wherever you lead.
Combine the best elements of all
parties, if possible to do so. Our
financial system must be placed back
where the founders of the Govern
ment placed it, —with the people’s
government as they choose to make
it, not with the bankers. The peo
ple have the right to create through
government forms of their own mak
ing, a fiat money of whatever mate
rial they choose.
Individually, I am opposed to all
tariff duties, no Church alliance with
political affairs, no alliance with So
cialism, nor negroism. You are brave,
X
free and right on all these questions.
Wishing you many happy New
Years, I beg to remain
Your devoted friend,
ELI BROWN.

THE CURSE OF ROMANISM.
Dear Sir:—lnclosed find check for
your Magazine. I am more than
anxious to read your articles on Ro
manism, for I think it is the greatest
curse that ever befell ihankind. Os
course, I am not much on its off
spring, and believe in a universal
Deity, not the Father of any sect or
ism. Dogmas of all kinds have ever
hampered the truth, and until evolu
tion has brought into the light
enough peoples to leaven the masses,
there is not much chance to elimi
nate such deep-rooted superstitions
as afflict the many who govern, and
absolutely divorce Church and State.
The only hope of a higher civiliza
tion lies in the purity of the Cau
casian race. There was never built
an empire, nor an enduring monu
ment, but it had its birth in the Cau
casian brain. I am sure that, in all
of the invaluable contributions that
you have adorned our language with,
none in importance will prove so far
reaching and so great a blessing to
unborn generations as your assault
on Catholicism. “Mystery, mystery,
Babylon the Great, the mother of
harlots and abominations of the
earth” but feebly expresses Roman
ism.
Your arraignment of Foreign Mis
sions will result in untold good for
the needy at our doors.
You can’t hope for much good in
our day, but future generations will
revere you and profit by your teach
ings. You know well that truth is
never very popular, and takes time
to soak into the average head, and
when you assail established tradition
you receive the cuffs and blows that
all have felt who have held up the
truth and light. Fight, for the hearts
of a multitude are with you, and fu
ture generations will call you
blessed. Your monuments will come
after, but let the consciousness of
right sustain you, for the fight you
have entered means the perpetuation
and growth of human liberty.
If I can render you a service at
any time, it will be a pleasure.
Wishing you a happy New Year
and many returns, and that you can
lay aside your work and come to see
us, I remain
Sincerely yours,
A. F. DURHAM.

HAS THE “OLD-TIME RELIGION”
VANISHED?
Dear Sir: —I am reading your pa
per with much interest. I admire the
editor that expresses his opinion
about men and measures in “plain
English” like you do. I am sure it
takes a man with “sand in the giz
zard” to attack the “Big Ikes” like
you are doing, but you are inviting
them to meet you in “the open
field”—proposing to give them a
fair fight, but they appear disposed
to decline your invitation, I suppose
entertaining doubts as to results. I
endorse your missionary doctrine
heartily. Let us endeavor to meet
cases of necessity and of emergency
at home first, then go to the Chi
nese with the gospel of truth. The
gospel is all that the Scripture re
quires us to furnish them. When I
was a boy, sixty-five years ago, our
preachers preached for the salvation
of souls —not for the money, the pay
was one dollar a work-day, Sunday
service free —no pay for Sunday;
they appeared in the pulpit in plain
dress —in home-made goods; preach
ed like a man fighting fire, and the
congregation took it all in. “Sorrow
flowed from eye to eye, and joy from
heart to heart.”
The good old mothers in Israel ran
over with joy, and shouted the praise
of God at the top of their voices.
How is it in our church services
these days? Well, it is who can ap
pear the most dignified amongst
the brethren, and who can make the
greatest display with braided hair,
or gold, or pearls, or costly array,

Hon. Ben L. Griffin is making the race for Congress from the Fifth
District of Arkansas. He is running on a fine platform, with
every prospedt of success. We hope he will win, for we
believe he will make a good Congressman.
amongst the sisters. Suppose a good
sister should shout in a church serv
ice these days, would it not very
likely create a panic? Yes, there is
a chilly sensation about the church
services nowadays—even in the heat
of summer. The first consideration
with most preachers now’ is the
salary. Why do most people go to
church, any way? Because it is cus
tomary, I suppose. My father and
mother said when I w r as a ten-year
old child, that I never would have
anything more than bread, unless my
playmates and associates had as
much as I had. I thank God for that
nature and disposition, which is deep
implanted in me, to help the needy,
to relieve suffering humanity, when
ever discovered, without asking any
questions as to how it happened.
But my proposition is to look after
those nearest to me first.
Success to you, Mr. Watson.
Yours respectfully,
W. G. FIELD.
