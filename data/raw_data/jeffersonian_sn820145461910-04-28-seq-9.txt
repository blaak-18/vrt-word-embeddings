For Mountain Girls
An Industrial School for Mountain
Girls, at Mineral Bluff, Ga., is the
cherished desire of the Georgia
Mountain Educational Association.
Mineral Bluff has a population of
three hundred souls. It is romanti
cally located on the Louisville &
Nashville Railroad, in the heart of
the Blue Ridge section of the State.
Here is a salubrious climate, excel
lent agricultural possibilities, splen
did water-power. Its principal in
dustrial concern is a tannery. At
Ducktown, twelve miles away, is a
big copper mine. *
Dotting the hillsides around about
are the homes of the typical moun
taineers —unpainted, two-room or
one-room abodes. The forebears of
these simple folk lost themselves in
the mountains about a century ago.
Had they inclined toward the sea in
stead, their posterity might have
been a cultured people today.
A shrewd Georgia farmer has as
serted that the education of “one
gal” means the education of a family.
We need a great industrial school
for girls in the Appalachian South.
Mineral Bluff, Ga., twelve miles from
the North Carolina line, eight miles
from the Tennessee line, is the place
for this school. *
The citizens of this little town will
donate toward this work five hun
dred dollars a year, twenty-five or
more acres of land, and some build
ing material.
The Association makes an appeal
to every man and woman in the State
of Georgia to help this cause.
Thousands of dollars go out of the
State of Georgia every year in behalf
of foreign people, when our first
duty is to our own.
The Georgia Mountain Educational
Association is trying to raise five
hundred dollars to meet the five hun
dred dollars that the Mineral Bluff
people will donate. It is proposed to
start the -work shortly with a do
mestic science department in connec
tion with the public school. When
sufficient funds materialize, the cur
riculum will include, besides cooking
lessons, lessons in housekeeping,
sewing, agriculture, floriculture,
stenography and typewriting.
For five thousand dollars a good
school building can be erected at
Mineral Bluff equivalent in value to
a ten thousand dollar structure in
many places. Bricks, which in At
lanta cost eight dollars per thousand,
in Mineral Bluff cost but four dollars
per thousand. Several hundred chil
dren from this immediate vicinity
alone could be gathered together to
morrow for industrial training were
it within their reach —children who
today are faring on badly cooked
food, in illy-ventilated homes, in
which the sanitary conditions are de
plorable. The education of one girl
means the education of a family.
There is an urgent need for an in
dustrial school for mountain girls.
The Georgia Mountain Educational
Association appeals to those interest
ed in the educational advancement
of the South to aid them in raising
funds to build and equip an Indus
trial School for Mountain Girls at
Mineral Bluff, Ga. Every dollar
counts. Small sums, as well as large
ones, will be gratefully received.

The School-Boys Taking Fire
Dear Sir: —I will vote in 1912;
that is my excuse for writing you
this. I want to vote for a man with
a conscience.
You said in your reply to “Bill”
Howard that you were not asking for
a job in the Government shebang,
or words to that effect. That you were
not a candidate. You may possibly
have reason to be discouraged, but,
pardon my seeming impertinence,
isn’t it your duty, as long as you
know you can do the people a serv
ice, to keep on running for some
thing where you can exert your in
fluence, as President or Congress
man?
I love you, Tom Watson, and your
politics. I hate a good many other
fellows of whom I’ve read —not alto
gether in your publications—who go
to Washington to do nothing for us
—unless ’tis some devilish trick.
They do nothing for the Farmers’
Union.
They impose on millions of la
borers.
I hate war and going man hunt
ing, but I am ready to fall in on the
whole push of the tyrants, that ought
to be servants, and slash and shoot
till the last drop of my red has leak
ed out. May be I’m impulsive, but I
planned this letter a long time and
hatched it, as you said of one Mr.
“Bill’s” epistle. I think we’ve got a
right to be hot. My brothers, “dad”
and kinsfolk all like you, and refer
to you as a man we can depend upon
to do things.
I like you because you are not
afraid of anybody. Because you stood
by your principles, and you were po
litically smothered—so my father
says—when your vote would have
sold for enough of “the filthy” to
have lifted you from the financial
embarrassment you seemed to be in.
But no buyer dared to approach, did
they?
Do take care of yourself and be
ware of noble Ferrer’s fate. Also
Lincoln’s and McKinley’s.
I’m going to educate myself to
Jeffersonian politics, and then lec
ture it and teach it everywhere I
take into my head to go.
We want you for President —we
young men of the South. Don’t we,
boys? If so, just send Mr. Watson
three lines saying as much.
He hasn’t time to read much of
our letters, so be brief.
So, Tom Watson, rest assured that
though you “drop out” suddenly and
right away, you will still live —not
your books alone, but your politics.
For I, for one, have resolved that the
devils, whom we call our servants
(or used to), at the Capital shall
have no more rest until they are
ousted, and their presence pollutes
our White House no more.
For this end I started educating
myself six months ago, in dead earn
est, too, and I get more and more
enraged and enthused, respectively,
each time I read of the Cannon gang
and the Watson remedy.
For the cause,
A SMALL FIRE-EATER.
Send us names for sample copies.
We will do the reet.

How Mr. Ellis Garbles His
Bible Quotations
Dear Sir:—ln reading Mr. Ellis’s
tirade in the Constitution, in re. cer
tain letters, etc., he uses two quota
tions from the Bible to support his
position on Foreign Missions. The
first was so badly mutilated that I
desire to call attention to the passage
in full.
He said that “Christ called His
twelve disciples and told them to
preach, heal the sick,” etc. He
omitted entirely that part of the com
mand which said, “Go not into any
way of the Gentiles, and enter not
into any city of the Samaritans,” and
quit entirely at “Get you no gold,
nor silver, nor brass in your purses;
no wallet for your journey, neither
two coats,” etc. I have been won
dering why Mr. Ellis omitted these
two parts of the quotation. There
is but one conclusion, and that is
that they upset the argument he was
making.
In the commission in Matthew 28,
he emphasises the words of the
Savior where Christ said, “Teaching
them to observe all things whatso
ever I commanded you.” This quo
tation is coupled with the first ap
parently with a view of making the
first explain the “all things what
soever I commanded you.” It is a
connection that no observing man
would make. If the first explains
the last, then the missionaries should
“enter not into any way of the Gen
tiles nor any city of the Samaritans,”
and he should take “no gold, nor sil
ver, nor brass; neither two coats,
nor shoes, nor staff.” How different
is the outfit of the modern mission
ary to that of the Disciples! Read
the invoices of the missionary fami
lies after the Boxer troubles, where
diamonds and fine apparel were so
much in evidence.
The “teaching whatsoever I com
manded you” is found more accu
rately in Luke’s account of this fare
well address of our Lord. Luke enu
merates the burden of the mission
ary. See Luke 24: 44-50. “All
things must be fulfilled
Thus it is written, that the Christ
should suffer, and rise again from
the dead the third day; and that re
pentance and remission of sins
should be preached in His name unto
all nations.” This was the message
carried by Paul and his co-workers.
Incidentally, Mr. Watson, did it

ever strike you as being significant
that the only collection taken by
Paul was among the churches estab
lished in his missionary work to suc
cor the destitute in Jerusalem? The
church from which he went out was
not asked to contribute anything in
the work, but the churches that he
did establish were asked to contri
bute to the home church. Some how
it looks as if we have reversed Paul’s
method.
