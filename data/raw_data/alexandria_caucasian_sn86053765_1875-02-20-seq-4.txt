ne«- ii by Jpini'H Cox, « III» lln-n « mvi.i i! a
fnuioiiH mjuHcnm. He fried in vain to
|»iiv ill« head (rum H iihw II , for, poor an
lin wan, nothing would at liivt Icmpt

eventually, to clear MniMf from debt,
lu: made the liend over to (.'ox. WI h ii
Cox at, last parted wiiii liin museum,
he ho I i I the head of Cromwell for
|o three men, who bought it, about the
timo of llu* French revolution, to ex
hibit in Mead Court, 15..nit h !reef, at
half a crown a head. Cnriomdy enough
it happened thai ilieno three gentlemen
died a midden death, anil I ho head
came into the possession of the three
nieces of the last man who died.—
These young Indies, nervous at keep
ing il in the house, asked Mr. Wilkin
son, their medical man, to take care of
It. for them, and they «nbscipiei.tly
Hold it to him. For the next tllteen or
twenty vears Mr. Wilkinson was in
the habit, of showing it to all fie dis
tinguish! d men of that day, and Hie
head, much treasured, yet reiiinin» in
hi« family
The circumstantial evidence is very
onions. It is the only head in history
which is known to have been embalm
ed and afterward beheaded. Oil the
lieck, near the vertebra', is the nullk of
the cut of an ax where I lie executioner
having, perhaps, no proper block, had
hi ruck too high, and, laying the head
in Us «oft. embalmed slate, on the I.lock
tlutlcned the'nose on one side, making
it adhere to the face, 't he hair grows
promiscuously about the lace, and the
beard, stained to exactly the same col
or by the embalming lii|iior, is tucked
up under the chin, with the oaken Mall'
of tho spear »villi which the l ead was
stuck upon Westminister llall, which
0,iag is perforated by a worm that, nev
er uttacks oak until it has been tor nul
H y years exposed to the weather.
7he iron spearhead, where it pro
trudes above the skull, is rusted away
by the action ol the atmosphere. 1 lie
jagged way in which the lop of the
skull is removed throws us back to a
time when surgery was su its infancy,
while the embalming is ho beautifully
done that the cellular process of the
gums and the membrane ot the tongue
are still to be seen. Several teeth are
yet in the mouth; the membrane ot
the eyelid remains; the pia mater and
tiie iliira-iiiater, thin membranes which
I believe, lie over the brain, may be
seen cling to the upper part of the skull
The brain was, of course renn. veil, lull
the compartments are very distinct.—
When I he great sculptor, Phixman went
t•• see it he said at once, ''You will not
mind my expiessing any disoppoint
liieiit I may feel on seeing the head f '
"Oh, no!" said Mr. Wilkinson, "but.
will you fell %9f the characteiistics by
which the head plight be recognized ï '
"Well," replied Flaxu.au, "I know a
good deal about the configuration ol
the head of Oliver Cromwell, //e had
iv low, broad forehead, large orbits to
the eyes, a high septum to the nose, and
high cheek-bones; but there is one lec
ture which will be with me a crucical
test, and that is, that, instead of hav
ing ihe lower jawbone somewhat cur
ved, it was particulaily short and
straight, but set out at an angle, which
gave hint a jowlish appearance," The
head exactly answered to the descrip
tion, and Flaxman went amay expres
sing himself as convinced anilib-lighteil.
The head has also ;i length from Ihe
forehead to the back of the head which
is quite extraordinary, and one day,
before Mr. Wilkinson retired from prac
tice., his assistant, called I. im into the
surgery to pointeur to him In.v.-exact
ly the shaven head of a lad who was
there as e patient resembled the em
balmed head of ('rem well up stairs, anil
more particularly in the extreme length
between the forehead and the occiput.
Mr. Wilkinson mentioned the ci i
eumstancc to the gentleman wh
brought the lad to him. "No wonder,"
said the gentleman, "for this lad is a
direct descendant of Oliver Cromwell,
whose name liko this boy's was Wil
liams before they changed it to Crom
well." it was curious that this lypc
should reappear or remain alter so
many years.
When the head was in the poscssion
of Samuel Kussel I he was frequently
intoxicated when he showed it to his
fiielids, anil Iliev cut oil' pieccs'if his
hair, until the head was closely crop
A correspi rdent of the Globe ol the
I wenty-eight h of September, or there
abouts, believed that tlio body of
( i oui well, after removal from the All
bey, was buried iu Ked Lion square,
and another body substituted and sent
to the Y'vburn with Ire tog) and lïiad
shuw. Hut it. is not probable they
fcoirtd have obtained an embalmed body
Ibr that purpose.
The embalmed head is now in the
possession of Mr. II orace Wilkinson,
Sevenoaks, Kent.
71.ere is small hole where the wart
was,on his forehead, and the eyebrows
met' in the middle. The head has the
appearance ot hard, dry leather.—
There are other details, and there is
other circuinstancial evidence, and
tin re are records printed and published
at the time, but I feel I must not ties
