WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
Champion American Comic Paper !
Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
can artists, and contributed to by the
most popular humorists and satirists of
the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the established humorous and
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as a
monthly, then, to satisfy the demn:ud of
the public, it was changed to a fortnight.
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
the political and social shams by its
masterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater success than ;
before, and was recognized as the ablest
and brightest of its class. Since then we l
have yielded still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be- l
ing the first successful weekly humorous'
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnisn illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth. Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to fame. ]
In its literary departments Wild Oats c
will, as it always has, stand alone and I
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical.
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appea that can offend the most fas
tidious.

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAGR BIT
TERS f" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of VIx
soAe BITTERa in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a Fentlo Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of Dn. WALK

No Person can take these Bit.

poison or other means, and vital or

Bilious, 1 emittent, and In.

prevalent in the valleysof our great
rivers throughout the United States,
espectally those of the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, Arkansas, Red, Colo
rado, Brazos, Rio Grande, Pearl,
Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. in their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful inhluence upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for. the rurpose
equal to Ds. J. WALnKER'a VINEiGAR
BITrsas, as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy fans
tious of the digestive organs.
Fortify the body against dis.
alie by purifying all its fluids with

Eructations of the Stomach. Iad Taste
in the Mouth, Bilious Attacks. Palpita
tion of the Heart, Inlammation of the
Langs, Pain in the region of the Kidneys,
and a hundred other painful symptoms,
are the offspringsof Dyspepsia. One hot

merits than a lengthy advertisement.

Every year increases the populari.
ty of this valuable Hair Preparation; n
which is due to merit alone. We e
can assure our old patrons that it is
kept fully up to its high standard; c
and it is the only reliable and perfect.
ed preparation for restoring GRAr d
oR FADED HAIR to its youthful olor,
making it soft, lustrous, and silken.
The scalp, by its use, becomes white in
and clean. It removes all eruptions `
and dandruff, and, by its tonic prop.
erties, prevents the hair from falling
out, as it stimulates and nourishes a
the hair-glands. By its use, the hair v
grows thicker and stronger. In
baldness, it restores the capillary
glands to their normal vigor, and t
will create a new growth, except in
extreme old age. It is the most eco
nomical HAIR DRESSING ever used,
as it requires fewer applications, t
and gives the hair a splendid, glossy a
appearance. A. A. Hayes, MI.D, e
State Assayer of Massachusetts, says, a
"The constituents are pure, and care. r
fully selected for excellent quality;
and I consider it the BEST P sEPA*
RATION for its intended purposes."
