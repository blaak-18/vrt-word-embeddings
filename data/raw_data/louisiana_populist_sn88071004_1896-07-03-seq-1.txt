I takes a good deal of Gov. OGlber
son'a time to explain on the stump and
iq the papers. We assure the gentle
man that his defeat next fall need not
necessarily prove fatal.
In law a conviction of felony works
no forfeiture of property rights, and we
assure the old party leaders and the
seed-tickers as well, thAt a defeat for
orce does not work a corruption of
blood, neither does it forfeit the right
to work for a living.
In 1$70 the assessed values were
$170,487,778. The current expenses of
the state were maintained upon an ad
valorem tax of 10 cents on the $100.
In 1895 the assessed values of property
was $860,910,657, state tax 25 cents,
school tax 20 cents on the $100. From
this statement it will be seen that our
taxes have grown from 1870, during a
Republican administration, from 15
cents on the $100 to 45 cents. Our tak
able values have increased from $170,
473,778 in 1870 to $860,910,576 in 1895.
While our assessed values have in
r-eased about $700,000,000 our rate of
taxation has increased 300 per cent.
In addition to this amount of increase
in taxation in 1888 the United States
paid into the state treasury $922,541,
which has been consumed in paying
current expenses of the state. Under
Democratic rule the state of Texas has
issued bonds to the amount of $200,000
with which to pay current expenses,
and with the beginning of 1895 there
was a deficiency of about $700,
000; thirty years 5 per cent
bonds $200,000; paid into treasury by
United States, $922,541; total, $1,822,
541. In addition to the increase of tax
rate to the deficit, to the money paid
by the federal government our occu
pation taxes have increased Crom 60 to
112 per cent. In 1880 the occupation
tax Imposed and coKected amounted
to the sum of $430,000. In 1895 it
amounted to $1,000,000. 9o to the ex
travagance of a Democratic state gov
ernment may be added another $600,
000 growing out of increased occupa
tion taxes, which added to $1,822,561
would make the enormous sum of
$2,422,541 squandered and dissipated
in extravagance over and above the in
creased ad valorem tax. The ad valo
rem tax has been increased $1,00,000
is excess of what it was for 1894, mak
ing a total of $3,722,541 of excessive
taxes to be paid In 5-cent cotton and
50-cent wheat, making your taxes
about 15 per cent of the market value
of all the products of your industry.

I charge that the leaders and law
makers of the Democratic party in
ITexa are not and never were in favor
of the free common schools; they are
not now and never were in favor of
the free education of the children of
the state. Th' first free school act by
a Democratic legislature was the act of
Jan. 21, 1854. It provided for the
maintenance of public ecaools by tax
ing the patrons of such hobool from
which to raise a fund. No children
were entitled to the benet of the
school unless the pro rats part of the
tax was paid by the parent, unless
such parent or patron was unable to
pay this tax. Then the trustees of
such school could certify this faet to
the county judge, who under the seal
of his oece should certify the same to
te state treasurer, and thereupon the
children of such paupers were admitted
to such scool, therheby perpetuasting
the humility of the parent and child
by makida this report a Me paper in
the public omees of this state. But I
am told that the Demoratcl party has
eajolned public free choools
throughout the state by a constitution.

PRESIDENT CLEVELAND'S RE
CENT BOND ISSUES.
Neither the Funding Act ot 1470. Nor
the Resumption Act of 1673 Au
thorizes the Issue of Bonds with
Which to Itay uold - Ruined the
Party.
There is no law on the statute books
authorizi!r the secretary of the treas
ury, or any one else to issue bonds to
buy gold for any purpose whatever.
Wherever there is any law authorizing
the i::sue of bonds to buy any kind of
money it stipulates "coin." Every sec
retary of the treasury from John Sher
man down has made a "law unto him
self"' that coin means gold. The section
of law authorizing the issue of bonds
for resumption purposes reads as fol
lows:
And on and after the 1st day of Jan
nary, A. D. 1879, the secretary of the
treasury shall redeem irn coin, the Unit
ed States legal tender netes then out
standing on their pre-,entation for re
demption at the office of the assistant
treasurer of the 'nited States in the
city of New York in sums of not less
than $50, and to en;.ble the secretary
of the treasury to prepare and provide
for the redemption in this act author
ized or required he is authorized to use
any surplus revenues from time to time
in the treasury not otherwise appro
priated, and to issue, sell, and dispose
of at not less than par in coin either of
the descriptions of bonds of the United
States described in the act of congress,
approved July 14, 1870, entitled. "An
act to authorize the refunding of the
national debt." with like qualities,
privileges and exemptions, to the extent
necessary to carry this art into full ef
fect.
This law says that "on and after the
1st day of January. A. D. 1879, the
secretary of the treasury shall redeem
in coin, the United States legal tender
notes then outstanding on their pres
entation for redemption.
The law does not say to redeem in
gold, but in coin. Nor did that law
contemplate the redemption of other
notes issued afterwards. But the sec
retaries of the treasury decided to turn
over to the holders of the notes (the
bankers) the option of demanding gold
payment. Besides, MrPCarlisle has un
dertaken to redeem notes not named or
contemplated in that law. That both
the law of 1876, and that of 1870, author
izing the issue of bonds contemplated
payment in either gold or silver at the
option of the government, we quote the
following resolutions introduced in the
United States senate in 1878. while
John Sherman was kicking up such a
racket about gold payments. The reso
lutiens are as follows:
Whereas, by the act entitled "An act
to strengthen the public credit," ap
proved March 18, 1869, it was provided
and declared that the faith of the
United States was thereby solemnly
pledged to the payment, In coin or its
equivalent, of all the interest-bearing
obligations of the United States, except
in cases where the law authorizing the
issue of such obligations had expressly
provided that the same might be paid
in lawful money or other currency than
gold and silver; and
Whereas, all the bonds of the United
States authorized to be Iasued by the
act entitled "An act to authorize the
refunding of the national debt," ap
proved July 14, 1890, by the terms of
amid act were declared to be redeemable
in coin of the then present standard
value, bearing interest payable semi
annually in such coin; and
Whereas all bonds of the United
States authorizsed to be issued under the
act entitled "An act to provide for the
resumption of specie payments," ap
proved July 14, 1875, are requilred to be
of the descriptlon of bondsof the Unit
ed States deseribed in the maid act of
congresas, approved July 14, 1870, e
titled "An act authorised refnading of
the national debt; and
Whereas, at the date of the passage
of said act of Congress last atoresaid,
to-wit, the 14th day of July, 1870, the
coin of the United 8tates of standard
value of that date included silver deol
tars of the weight of 412% grains each,
declared by the act approved Jamnary
18, 1887, entitled "An acset supplement
ary to the act entitled 'Ansact establsh
lag a minat and regulating the coins of
the United States,' " to be a legal ten
der of payment accerding to their ao
nal valne far any sums whatever; there

Reaolved by the Senate (the House of
Representatives concurring therein),
That all the bonds issued by the United
Statesr, Issued or authorised to be issued
adet the said acts of Coaress hereL -
before recited, are payable, principal
and iterest, at the option of the gov
ersnent of tho United tates1 sin ilver

Intended to settle the question of gota
payment of "coin" obligations of the
United States. It ought to be evident
that the $262,000,000 of bonds issued to
retain a gold reserve in the Treasury,
when there was an abundance of silver
to pay all obligations was a violation
of the law and the bonds are fraudu- C
lently issued. It is generally conceded,
we think, by our best lawyers that no
law exists authorizing the issue of the
bonds, but they console themselves
with, and take refuge behind, the state
ment that the necessity of the case de
manded it. We believe the day will
come when this whole matter will be in- l
vestigated, and the bonds declared to d
be illegal and repudiated as such.
TWENTY WHYS.
Which Republicans and Democrats Will a
Do Well to Think About.
Why does it take lawyers to explain I
the great principles of the democratic c
and republican parties, while farmers
explain the principles of the people's
party?
Why is it that members of the peo
ple's party can tell why they are Popu
lists, and republicans and democrats
cannot tell why they are republicans
and democrats?
Why can Populists understand the
financial situation, but democrats and
republicans cannot understand it?
Why do Populist papers and speak
ers tell the people that they can In
derstand the finance question, but the
republican and democrat papers and
speakers tell them that they can not?
Why do democrat and republican
leaders ask the people to take a po
sition upon a question that they can
not understand?
Why do Populist leaders urge every
man to study politics, and the old party
leaders ridicule the idea of farmers and
laborers understanding politics?
Why do Populists try to learn the
people politics, and the two old parties
try to make them believe that they are
too ignorant to learn?
Why do Populists invite democrats
and republicans to come and join the
issue with them at their public speak
ings, but the two old parties refuse
Populists the same right at their pub
lic speakings7
Why should men vote upon issues
they do not understand?
Why is it that the democrats never
quote Lincoln on finance?
Why is it that the republicans never
quote Lincoln on finance?
Why not druop the legal tender clause
of gold by our law if it is the money
of the world independent of law?
Why object to the full legal tender
clause and free and unlimited coinage
of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1, if law
does not make money?
Why should a man want a gold
standard that he never owns, to travel
in foreign countries where he never
goes, and objects to silver and green
backs for fear he will get too much,
while he and his family is double
worked, half clothed, rough fed, and
cannot pad his debts?
Why should farmers want high
salaried officials, high taxes, high in
terest on the money, and low priced
products to foot the bill with?
Why should the farmer be in favor
of the government loaning money to
national banks at one per cent. per
annum and not loan to the farmer at
any price?
Why do not religious democrats and
republlcans take God's advice on usury
if they cannot understand the finance
question?
Why do preachers not take such tests
as "The Love of Money is the Root of
all EviL" "It is easier for a camel to
go through the eye of a needle, than
for a rich man to enter the kingdom
of heaven." "He upset the tables of
the money changers." "Restore, I pray
ye, to them even this day, their lands,
their vineyards, their olive yards, and
their houses, also the hundredth part
of the money and of the corn, the wine
and the oil that ye exacted of them."
Why does a preacher serve God left
handed, but serve mammon with his
right hand?
Why did Christ tavor the tramp and
tramp hlmself, and oppose the rich and
our preachers take the reverse?
