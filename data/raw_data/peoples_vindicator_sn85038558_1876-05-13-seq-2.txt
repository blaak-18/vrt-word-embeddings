Considerable cotton in town for
sale one day this week, from the
parish of Sabine. We counted
six wagons in sight coming in, all
loaded with the royal staple;
quite an unusual sight in the
month of May. The entire cargo
was bought by one Firm, at 8?
@ 10c. A very good sale for
the state of the market.
The Missionaries, Fathers De
Ham and Lamy, closed their work
here last Monday night, and left
on the Bart Able. It is impossi

they accomplished during their
stay, but this we do know, a great
many went to confession with
them and made their peace with
. God. Many more did not do it,
who, perhaps, may sooner or later
regret the lost occasion.

The Party.
The people of Louisiana assembled
in Convention in the city of New Or
leans last January, and with but one
dissenting voice, declared that the
party of the people, and for the people
should hereafter be known as the
Democratic-Conservative Party of the
State of Louisiana, and all those op
iposed to Radical misrule and bad
management, were cordially invited
to come into its folds for the purpose
of driving from power the miserable
cormorants and vampires who have
been sucking her life-blood for the
last eight years. Can any one pre
tend to say that this Convention was
not a representative body? Can any
one affirm that the men there assem
bled were not capable of expressing
the views of the great mass of the
people ? To all intents and purposes
it was the same thing as if the entire
population composing the wealth :glad
intelligence of the State, had there
convened and declared in their soy
ereign capacity, that they desired in
sciibed on the banner under which
they expected to march to political
victory, The Great Democratic Con
servative Patty of the State of Lou
isiana. Now since this party was so
oanmed, with so much unanimity, with
so much enthusiasm, with 'so much
earnestness, does it not look like
treason for any person to come for
ward in the face of all this, and pro
pose the formation of a new party ?
The people are pledged, irrevocably
pledged to its support, and the mem
ory of that Convention lives as a
guarantee of the good faith of all
men who desire to see Louisiana re
deemed and disenthraled from the
fetters of the thievish ring-masters,
who have rioted in high carnival in
her public offices, and diiven to des
peration the true sons of the soil.
The Convention was regularly call
ed and the delegates duly accredited
thereto by the people of the various
parishes of the State, and in a great
many of the parishes ratideation
meetings were held, and the acts of
the Convention fully endorsed at these
meetings. Now how can it be pos
sible then, this late in the day, to
talk about repudiating the long con
firmed acts of their representatives.
Such thoughts should cause the blush
of shame to tinge the cheek of any
man, who for a moment should en
tertain them. That Convention lives
fresh in the memory of all true Lou
isianians, and they can turn to it
with pride, and take counsel from its
principles without any detriment to
their interest, or any damage to their
welfare.
Mr. A. H. Leonard was there, and
attempted to introduce fire-brands
and bolips of contention, and seemed
bent on bringing the work of the
Contvention to naught, if ihe could not
succeed in carrying his disorganizing
projects through; but in as much as
lie did not awaken a single sympa
thetic voice, 'or cause an emotion
kindred to his own distempered feel
ings, we had thought that Ire had
made up Iris mnd that he could not
lead thIe people where they wished
not to go, and learning this fact, it
was presunmable that he would retire
from the self-imposed position of
leader, and be content to take his
place in thie ranks of the party which
had unmistakably shown him that
they desired not hiis leadership.
We woutd not have recurred to this
political heresy, but for the fact, that
we have noticed such favorAble re
marks on Mr. Leonard's letter and
criticisms on ours, wherein we said it
shlould fall still-born, in the pap-fed
Radical Press of tihe State. Yes,
there is where time favorable notices
come from. Of course they would be
delighted to see the great Democratic
Conservative party weakened, and its
ranks thinned by such letters as Mr.
Leonard has written, or by any other
means they could 'inteject into its
harmonious workings. Of course they
would like to have anotherfour year's
pull at the public crib, and it is only
through such means as these, they
see any hope of success.
The Weather .
On last Saturday afternoon it be
gan to rain, accompanied with a few
pieces of hail, and the most vivid
flashes of lightning and terriefi peals
of thunder, perhaps ever heard in
this country, The rain continued un

imaking in all an unprecedented rain

The river at this place rose in a short
space of time nearly five feet. The
planters complain of the damage done
to corn and cottoo; in sdme places
the young plants were washed up by
the roots, and in other low places the

tlhe water standing too long. Sinee,

THE PEOPLE MOVING.
Natchitoches Parish to the
Front.
,On Monday, 8th in st, the people of
the parish assembled in Convention,
pursuant to a previous call from the
Chairman of tlie Central Parish Ex
ecutive Committee, Col. David Pier
son. In another column will be found
the proceedings in fill, and if it is
not proof positive, of the determinan
tion of the party to engage in the
coming struggle with a vim, then we
must say we cannot read the signs of
the times in their true light. Some
of the distant wards were not repre
sented, owing to the heavy rain that
had fallen the day before the Con.
vention, swelling the streams so that
it was impossible to cross them.
The proceedings were marked by
the greatest harmony and unanimity.
Every delegate present, seeming to
vie with each other in their efforts to
show to the people that they were in
deep, solemn, and determined earnest
ness, and willing to forget self or
selfishness for the main point in
view, which they declared to be
"DOWN WITHl USURPING RADICALISM
IN LOUISIANA, AND I.ET TIlE BAN
NERS OF JUSTICwF WAVE IN TRIUMPH
OVER THE PEOPLE."
This is to be the battle cry, and if
the Radical party can stand the heavy
broad-sides that are to be poured into
it from the justly indignant masses,
then virtue is a mockery, and brazen
faced villiany an accomplishment
worthy to be imitated.
The party may now be considered
thoroughly organized in this parish
on an active working basis, and if
any one thinks they do not intend to
win this election the coming Fall,
then all we have to say is, that they
are most egregiously mistaken. The
members composing that Convention
were no idlers seeking office, or party
men for party sake;, but they were
the sturdy farmers and substantial
business men of the community, seek.
ing in the broadest sense, the good of
their fellow-citizens, thoroughly im
bued with the importance of the oc
casion that caled them together.
They all left their own private affairs
to meet and counsel with each other,
as to the best mode and. manner of
carrying on the campaign and defeat
ing the enemy, and their harmonious
acts were a full guarantee, that the
aim will be accomplished, and the
ides of Nomember will see the fol
lowers of Kellogg, Packard & Co.,
driven into merited obscurity, and
Law and Justice once more rule the
fair State of Louisiana.
Below we insert a characteristic
letter from the Hon. R. R. . Marr, to
the Picayane, and can fully endlorse
his views, as to the duties of dele
gates to any nominating Convention
To the Editor of the Picaynne :
In reference to a paragraph in your
morning paper, indicating the views
of the delegates to the National Dem
ocratic Convention, will you please
say in your evening paper that there
has been no meeting of the delegates
to the National Convention, and no
opportunity for any expression of
their chlmice f
I anm authorized by Mr. James Mc
Connell, John Tobin, Louis St. Mar
tin and Albert Voorhies to say, in,
their behalf, as I do for myself, that
whatever may be our personal pre
ferences, we deem it uonwise and in
every way improper to express them
at this time, or to do anything whiclh
would forestall publio opinion or
commit us to the support of any can
didate or aspirant.
The determination is to go to the
Convention unpledged, and prepared
to support such candidate as we may
think most acceptable and likely to
unite and command the support of
the entire opposition to Radicalism.

One of the Delegates.

The People of Natchitoches Par
ish in Convention Assembled,
by duly accredited representations
from its several Wards, make this
charge: That tihe outrages to which
they have been subjected in person
and robbery in pourse, are the delib
erate acts of time Radical party of this
State, aided and abetted by the mili
tary power of the United States, a
party to our people of proscription
and persecation, a party of vice and
ignorance, a party whose rapacity for
fraud and wrong is beyond mposure,
as the loatheosme exposures, of both,
high and low ofleials of that party,
of late prove, a party whose sins of
commission and onmission, have elici
ted for as the sympathy of the con
servative people of tie entire nation.
We charge that this party possesses
no element of reform, and from the
character of its constituent parts can
not possibly relieve us of thie burden
we bear, for it exists alone by the
eo-hesive power of plunder. In our
parish and State, in this contest there
ean be no intermediate ground; it is
a battle between virtue and vice, be
tween intelligence and ignorance, and
between honesty and thievery. Be
lieving that thIe Demerantic-Conser
vative party of this 8tate to be the
only party possessing the elements
and desire to relieve us, we solemnly
pledge to it our nodivided, vigorous
and anyielding support, and to this
end, will set aside and frown down
all jealouasies and all measures
tending to divide our people. We
assert and will fearlely maintalin
the right to emntrol our local ffalirs,
free from Illegal Interferensee of Fede
ral or State oiclals, or individuals,
of any party whatsoever. We tfar.
ther ssert that honesty anud itelli
gnee, should be quoalleations esmen
Sial for political preferment, uad we
ped a ourselves to support no others
p.risb sad Stats oiciale, than
such-as truly represent the ta-payr
in; and honest maeas of the peaOple.
In that view we cordially invite all
persondand classes to unite with us
in the effort to overthrow the jagger
naut of IRadicalism desolating our
State; and we declare that those who
do not join in this effort, in this hour
of great gloom, are more dangerous
enemies to intelligence and virtue, to
the public good and general prosperi
ty of our people, than the most avow
ed of our open enemies.
On motion, it was Resolved that the
People's Vindiaentor and New Orleans
Democrat, be requested to publish the
proceedings of this Convention.
On motion, it was Resolved that
this Convention earnestly request the
voters of this parish to subscribe for,
and use every effort to increase the
circulation of the People's Vindica

the people's wishes
On motion, it was Resolved that the

Our Washington Letter.
Washington, D. C. May 1, 1876.
THE CANDIDATES.
Senator Thurman's Ohio friends are
becoming very active in his behalf,
and while they anticipate a sharp
fight in their own State, they claim
to have secured a considerable
strength for him in other States, and
if they can control Ohio, they expect
to present the Senator at St. Louis
with a good backing. The New York
men are jubilant to-day over the
unanimous declaration of the New
York convention in favor of Tilden.
Just what the friends of Governor
Hendsricks are doing is not apparent;
but it is to be presumed that a strong
backing is being organized for him.
Speaker Kerr is pledged to his sup
port, and the House was organized
in his interest. If he is not nominated
at St. Louis, it will not be for want of
friends. I do not think, however,
that personal popularity will influ
ence the convention unless it be ac
companied by absolute strength with
the people. The Democratic party
were never more thoroughly in earn
est and determined to nominate a oman
they can eleet, than now. All the in
dications point to an harmonious ac
tion at St Louis, in the interest of the
party as a whole. Sectional differ
ences are less prominent every day ;
anid good feeling, and a willingness to
sink personal preferences for the gen
eral good, are expressed on every
side.
THE LAST OF THE CORIPET-BAG SEN
ATORS
is probably George E. Spencer of Al
abama, whose election was recently
investigated by a Republican Sen
atorial committee. The bucket of
a hitewash has been duly prepared,
and will probably be dumped into
the Senate by Morton, Chairman of
the Committee on Privileges and
Elections, within a week or ten days.
That Spencer procured his election
by corrupt means no one dorubts i but
the Republican members of thre com.
mittee strenuously objected to any
other testimony than would be ad
mitted in a court of lawi, and tire re
suit was that Gen. Morgan, the cro
sel for the Alabama legislature, found
himself hampered at every turn, and
was not rernitted to' introhuce any
testimony, even tlmnagh conclusive in
its nature, which could be excluded
by the strict rules governing legal
evidence. Time majority of the eom
mittee went so far, also, in their ef
forts to protect their radical coleague,
as to peremptorily declhie to summon
several witnesses named by the prose
cution. Of course the minority,
blessrs. Bayard, Merrimon, and
Cooper (Democrats) dissented from
the arbitrary and unjust rulings
of Morton and hIis confreres; but their
protests wore of no avail, and tihe
result will be two reports-one in
favor of, and one against, thie carpet
bag Senator from Alabama. A mdan
of no ability, and believed to be
thoroughly corrupt, Spencer is des
pised not only by thie Democratic
Senators, but by the Republicans who
profess to be his friends. The latter
will continue Spencer in his position
not because they believe that he is
entitled to it but because their major
ity in the Senate is so small that the
loss of a single Senator, just now,
would deprive tlhem of a vote which
they need on many occasions, when
party lines are not rigidly adhered to,
and some of their number, Edmunds,
Christiancy, Paddock, and others, fall
into line with the Democrats.
LOUIsLANA'S SCALAWAG SENArTOR.
Since investigations and personal
explanations seem to be the order of
the day, it is somewhat strange that
thie notorious Senator from Louisiana,
J. R. West, has not followed thie ex
emple ofthe illustrious Blaine, and
denied the long list of charges that
have been made through the press
against his honor and integrity as a
man and a Senator. These acceusa
tions have remained nurefuted for
months, and the public begin to be
lieve tley are true in every respect.
From the New Orleans Democrat,
however, it waould appear that West
proposes to resort to thie courts for
redress, and bas instituted a' suit for
libel against thatpaper. In referring
to this courne of the Senator, the Dem
oarat says:
Our WVaebhington correspondent tele
graphe ns that West proposes to sue the
Duc,-.t for libel. We are not informed,
however, for what specifice truth we have
told we are to be sued. Will West sue
us because we proved him to be a forger,
and published the evidence of the fact?
Or will he sue us for printing the trnth
about his villainous life el California dur
ing the war Or will he sue us beaesuse
we exposed the fact that he co-operated,
for a prime, with Babcock and Port r, to
have Billings appointed judge ? Or will
he sue us because we have told of his
running off with the faunds of the New
Orleans fire company before the war? Or
will be mae as beeause we stated, what
every man in Louisiana believes to be a
feet, that he bought his election in the
United State. Senate for thirty-six thoe
and dollars ?
It will be seen, by the above par*
agraph, that the Deauocrat is not
mueh alarmed at the prospect of the
threatened law soit.
THe BELNAP IMPEACHMENT TBIAL
promises to be a tedious affair. Al
though time defendant's counsel failed
in thleir efforts to get tihe ease post
oaned to Deciht lber y do not nP.
pear to have lost confidence that the
result of the trial will be favorable to
their client, through legal technicali
ties. Ex-Senator Carpenter, the
senior counsel for Belknap, is thor
oughly interested in the case, and
will avail himself of every technicali
ty to prevent the conviction of his
client. Judge Jere. S. Black and
Hon. Montgomery Blair are associa
ted with him in an advisary capacity,
but Carpenter being on friendly terms
with all the Senators who were form
erly his colleagues, and knowing just
how to handle themr to the best ad
vantage, is put forward as best cal
culated to influence the decision of
the Court. Carpenter, while a favor
ite with the Republican members of
the Senate, secured the respect of the
Democrats by speaking and voting
with them on many important ques
tions-notably the question of the ad
mission of I'inchback, the dusky as
pirant for Senatorial honors from
Louisiana. lie was not in the Sen
ate, however, when the final vote was
taken, but his constitutional argu
ment against Piuchback's admission
was one of the most powerful protests
that came from either side of the
chamber. If allowed to do so, he
will introduce much testimony of a
negative character. Major General
McDowell and other prominent army
officers will be introduced to testify
that they have always regarded jGen.
Belknap as an honest man, and nev
er knew of a dishonest act on his part;
in fact the defence will be long and
elaborate, unless the Senate confines
itself, as it should do, to the only
relevant question. "Did Belknap,
while Secretary of War, sell post.
traderships ?" If the Senate allows
the counsel for Belkuap to introduce
a massof negative testimony, the re
sult will be
A LONG SESSION OF CONGRESS.
The Senate Ihs already evinced a dis
position to non-concur with the llouse
in its recommendations in regard to
reducing the expenses of the Govern
ment, as embodied in the various ap
propriation bills. The House is de
termined to insist on economy, and
the Senate seems as fully set on de
feating all redactions. The result of
this must be a session ertending far
into the summer. Aside from this,
there are many other important ques
tions before Congress which will elicit
extended debate, and necessarily pro
long the present session. C. D.

An Open Letter.
BATON ROUGE, April 18th, 1876.
Hon. J. Henri Burch :
DEAR SI--Having severed my con
nection with the Republican party,
and as you have long been consider
ed a Representative man among our
race, and a Republican "of the first
water," in Louisiana polities, I feel
that I have a perfect right to
address you this an open letter and
give some of the reasons why I have
felt it my duty to sever my connec
tion with you and those who for the
last twelve years I have labored po
litically, for what I then thought to
be the best interest of my people.
Immediately after the Reconstruction
Acts of Congress, passed by a Repub
lican Congress, for the sole purpose of
securing the Southern States the right
of suffrage was vested in our race;
before, however, this was given, and
immediately after thie shackles of
slavery bad been stricken from our
limbs, by thie results of the war, we
were recognized as the nation's wards,
or more properly the Relpublican par
ty's wards. Emissaries were sent
uamong us, as agents of thie Freed
man's Bureau, had and wicked men,
who, under the gathb of charity, be
gan systematically to poison tihe
minds of thie colored people against
tle old white citizens, ignorant and
illiterate they knew nothinig of the
relative merits of the two great po
litiealparties, their prejudices were
stimulated( their suspicions excited
and their cupidity worked upon.
When the right to vote arrived, they
were readily arrayed against their
former masters. They never stop.
ped to consider or inquire into tile
antecedents of a man, where Be came
from, whether he was capable of fill
ing the ofbee or whether his moral
chlaracter was good 'or bad; his de
claration that hlie was a Republican
and an endorsement by you and other
leaders was all that was necessary.
You well remember your predecessor
thie notorious Gee. WIV. Regan twice
elected to the Legislative branch ot
tile State, a prominent candidate for
Congress and the recognized leader of
the Republicna party in this parish
for a number of years, caught with
stolen property in his possession and
publicly exposed on lthe streets of our
city, an adept in tim string game by
which he frequently victinized e'olor
ed men, during the war, and a white
man, who deserted his white wife in
his Northern home, and lived here in
open conenbinage with a well known
lewd colored woman and dying while
a senator ill thle city of New Orleans,
from mania potu in a low brothel.
When you were nominated by the
Republican party to fi81 thie place of
Regau, I was a member of thie State
Central Coomr.ittee, I urged your nom
ination and worked faithfully for your
election, you were tlien a poor school
teacher and had thie entire confidence
of our race, I rejoiced at your elec
tion, for I felt that a worthy colored
man would fill thie place left vacant
by the infamous Regan, having been
educated yourself, I believed you
could appreciate thie necessity of edu
cating our race, for by education alone
must they expect to be elevated to a
standard of respeetability, and as the
majority of us were without the
means of educating our children, our
only hope was in the public schools.
Have our hopes been realized ? Let
the children running wild throughl tihe
streets answer! let the unpaid teach
ers answer. The old law which in
better days made the public school
s3 satem of Louisiana thie pride of her
citizens has been abolished, and tile
substitute presented by the Republi
can party, is nothing but a magnifi
cent humbug, intricate, cumbersome,
and with some few Honorable excep
tions, managed by a band of political
bummers, by whom the poor children
of the State are deprived of an edu
eation atd tlie property holders are
anonually robbed. You have had
yourself elected keeper of thie school
funds, have moved the books, papers
and money, if any, to the city of New
orleans, and when thie tax-payers, in
convention assembled, attempted to
iustitute an investigation of your of
fcial management of the schomol founds,
yeou though as bhumble citisen and
only th aervant of thle people, pre
dtecnded to bco nit, ighly jmlil- "
declared ynu'self" ihlnstelt ad vand
attempted to detract attention,
attacking the personal characte o
your predecessor. Notwitislftas
the fact that you have long b1leen
sidered the particular pet of the.
publican party of this parish, bar
time and again been honored wit
offices of honor and trust, yon ha6
never seen fit to provide youRselfie
with one foot of land, or pay one eet
of taxes. It is true you app e
one time in our midst, Sporting a f
horse and fancy buggy; how ye
came in possession of them it is
my business to inquire, but I remea.
be it was juslt after the session of t
Legislature of '70, which was render.
ed infamous by the large number of
monopolies fostered upon the
of the State and the wholesale
out of the members. Our ex-Colle
tor, better known as "old Fox," a
your recognized partner in the Rd&.
cal tub mill, the Tax Collector's og
had you assessed in the sum of two
hundred and fifty dollars for this
turn out, charged you on the Stte
tax Roll $3 f"2-1(N) and "2 81.00 on
the parish roll, making the sum dLu
by you to the parish and State $6 4.
100, which of course you never pli
and was regularly returned, and now
appears as a delinquent tax-pays.
With these, among a thousand other
short comings, can you wonder at mn
loss of faith in the Republican party
and her leaders in Louisiana, ea
you blame me for quitting the peati.
lent ship, reaking with corruption,
and sooner or later destined to sink
forever from the sight of honest e,
and live in memory as a hidiosmnight
mare, that well nigh destroyed a
large and glorious State.
C. Z. LANGE.
We expect soon to be able to
lay before our readers, the com.
plete organization of the party in
all the North Louisiana parishes,
and with this view, would respect.
fully ask them to send notice to
ns, so soon as the work of organi.
zation is perfected.
The Amite City Demoarat came
this week on a half-sheet, eans,

it is one of the ablest papers pub.
