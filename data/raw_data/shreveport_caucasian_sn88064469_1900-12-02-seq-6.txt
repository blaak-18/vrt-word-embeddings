A movement to lnterest the public 1
school teachers and public school pupils (
In the Pan-American Exposition to be c
held at Buffalo next summer has been -
started. It originated in some of the
public schools of Pennsylvania and is I
being taken up elsewbhre as the wis- I
dom of the plan becomes apparent. The I
idea is to have the teachers in the Ipubl
lic schools write essays for vnrtous oc
casions of an educational character on I
the objects and alms of the Expositlon I
and the bearing that such a display 1
will have on the comlmerce of the I
world. A similar plan regarding the 1
Paris Exposition was found quite suc- 1
cessful and resulted in the attendance I
of a large corps of teichers at that fair. I
The plan contemplates also essays by I
pupils. It is believed that in this way I
much information can be spread re
gardlug the benefits to be derived from I
cultivating closer relations with the
different countries of this bhemispbere
and that it would result in greater in
telligence anlong the public school
teachers and pupil on this subject, as
well as a larger attendance almong this
class of the population at the.Exposi
tion.

be utnperstood that the trouble with
this arid land does not 11e in many to
entities in n lark of rainfall Terte is it
suffidlency of the latter, but the nature
of the soil does not pt'r'.tit of its reten
tion. From thifs and other causes the
arid region Is almost without lakes or
other natural reservoirs. The topogra
'ph'y of the country is. however, such
that the construction of artiliiial reser
moire would 1st comparatively easy if
undertaken under proper direction and
annervision
In many lnstances the arli land of I
the west Ihas bee r.e rclaimed nland m:odel 1
fertile by irrigatick' securedl by private
Individuals and c(rporaiions. The di- -
advantage to the n*l:on at large of al
lowing thii imnportaul work to be dlone 1
by privatle parties is that they thereby
scu-re control of the water Isu)PIY. I
They then forever afterward hold the
key to the situation,. and, looking only
to their Immediate beneit, the work Is
not dlone as well as it carried out by
the government on a comprehensive.
well balanced plan. Private irrigation
is apt to become a monopoly and the
water rates excessive. Unless the work
of Irrigation is dlone by the govern
ment. local. state or national, it is more
apt to be a hindrance than a benefit to
a locality. For this reason, those inter
ested in irrigation are seeking the aid
of the national government.
Both of the great Iparties itn their na
tional platformis are comlniltted to the
support of mneasures looking to the ex
tension of irrigation by the govern
ment. The department of agriculture
has already done much work In the
way of preliminary surveys of reser
voir sites and forest preservatiotn. It
is hardly necessary to exllai:i that the
preservation of forests exercises a cor
respondingly benelicial effect on the
water supply of a region.
The arid region of the United States
lies in Arizona, southern (California.
('olorado., Ildaho, Montana, New Me xi
co. UItah, WyomIing andl the portions
of Oregon and Washington lying ea:st
of the ('ascade range. It is much
smialler than fornIerly, for there have
been thousalnds of Iattempts, moiore or
less successful, at Irriaition and the
sinking of artesian Wells.
Thle motto of tihe irrigattoi congress
Is. "Save the foristS and store the
floods." The c(irc-l:ir which was sent
throughout ithe country read: The
magic touch of waiesr will work this
transfornimation. The conservation of
the water supplies miIust therefore be
first accomplishedl. The forests. which
are nature's storag$ reservoirs, must
be preservedl. and thie waters thait now
go to waste in destrulctive floods must
b le stored in great reservoirs and saved
for beneticial use. The national gov

After Doctore Fail
Baton Rouge, La., Feb. 12. 1900.
I was a sufferer for seventeen years. I had three family doctors in consultation and they decided that my
health would remain bad until I had a child. They continued to treat me for four years with no success except to
get our money. There were two more years with a great expenditure of money with no satisfactory results and we
abandoned all hope. Finally our cousin, Jane Jones, of Woodville, Miss., paid us a visit and finding my health very
bad, introduced Wine of Cardul and Thedford's Black-Draught and we decided to give them a trial. My husband then
wrote for a copy of Home Treatment of Female Diseases. After studying its contents. I found all my complaints
outlined, word for word, and sent for a bottle of Wine of Cardui and a package of Thedford's Black-Draught. After
the use of the first I found relief. I re-ordered untV ' had used eleven bottles and found my health very
much improved. To our surprise a baby soon appearee. ,h is just as fat as a pig. Such a thing had not hap.
pened in seventeen years. I would urge all ladies in poor health to use your medicines. They are more than you
claim they are. I have not had any use for a doto, sine using the first bottle of your wonderful medicine My
health is all right in every way. Mrs. L F. GERMANY.
WINE OFCARDUI i
Thinr of her suffering the agonies of female complaints for seventeen years and the suffering all
unnecessary. Mrs. Germany could have been cured years ago just as well as now had she only taken
Wine of Cardui. She need not have had those harrowing pains and grinding aches. her experience
should induce every sufferer who reads this paper to give Wine of Cardui a trial. Instead of wasting
time and money with doctors when no benefit is being received from them, get a bottle of this great
rrmedicine from your druggist. Wine of Cardui will annihilate those monthly pains which make your
life a torture and will bring you a permanent cure. Don't decide you cannot be well even when
doctors have failed. Try Wine of Cardui. All druggists sell $1.00 battles.
