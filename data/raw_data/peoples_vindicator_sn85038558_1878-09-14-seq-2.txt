NO50 LAW.
We understand that a large num
ber of colored men in this parish are
preaching a crusade against law.
They have been put up to it no
doubt, but we complain nevertheless
that they are most susceptible of be
ing "put up" to believe and do bad
things.
This preaching for "no law"
amounts to a violent tirade against
the courts for convicting negro thieves
and ridding honest communities of
them by putting all such in the
penitentiary. To this, the average
Radical negro objects, and he is sue
tained in the objection-onay, encour
aged in it-by Blunt and his army of
preachers. The white people don't
intend to be eternally ding-donging
into the negro what he ought to do.
He knows well enough already. Nor
do we intend to apologise for the
courts. They have done their duty
fearlessly and impartially, and we
intend to sustain their decisions. We
refer to this argument now being
used against the whites simply to
show that the negro is determined to
be a bad citizen if he can possibly do
so-and that on the lamest excuse.
He insists that he has the right to
steal without punishment; he insists
he has the right to vote for and elect
all manner of liars and felons to of
fice, and he insists there shall neither
be moral or legal restraint on him in
either of these rights--and all the
time he knotws he is doing wrong.
Where innocent people do harm
through ignorance it is all well, but
when they do it from blind hatred
and with a determination to injure,
they deserve and will receive pun
ishment.
As the negro has selected to do in
jury, not only to the material inter
eats of his employer and superior,
but is determined to suppress all law ;
as he is determined that license is
what be demands, not liberty, he will
be treated with such rigor as will give
him a lasting lesson in citizenship.
Spurning the advice and tuition of
those who would be, his. friends; de
termined to destroy, all honor and
virtue, that he may riot in barbarism,
be must take the consequences. The
white race are determined on honest
government, lie is determined on the
contrary-then let him asseme all the
responsibility of his acts. He will
have no child's play to indulge in,
and a lesson will be taught him this
year he'll not forget soon.
Begister.
Every spark of manhood should
urge the whites of this parish to thel
registration and the polls. The Rad
icals will make their last and great
est efforts this year, and every white
man must be on the alert.
A Good Ticket.
We want a good ticket; of good
men, good Democrats, and all in safe.
To the Registration.
Every white mans duty is plain for
the next sixty days--it is to register.
If he neglects it, he deserves to be a
slave to a negro master. r
Attentiont
You must register ! Your old pa
pers will not do. ..

1s it a Tidal Wave.
The result of the election in Maine
on Tnesday last, an tlhat in Vermont
on the Monday pirevious. most pro
dnee the utniost consternation in Re
publican ranks. Their mnajority in
the former State has been swept to
the winds. Their vote for Governor
this year has fallen behind that of
last election over ten thousand, while
their Congressmen are elected, when
elected at all, by a plurality of votes.
Hale, one of tile bitterest and most
spiteful of di ty New England Radi
cals, line been defeated, while the
State, and Holostue of Representatives
is in the hands of the I)emocrates
and Greenbackers.
This looks to us like a tidal wave,
more terrible than 1874.
The Fourteenth.
To day should he set apart fort tholy
observance. The day upon which
fell, in the cause of freedom, those
gallant souls of the White League of
New Orleans.
To-day, four years ago, the death
blow was struck Radicalism and Ne
groism in Louisiana. From the m.
ment of the sharp crack of the first
gun of the brave Ogreu' beand, thait
monster of iniquity drooped, wither.

that we should bold in reverence this
day. Not in ostentation, parade or
show, but in our qniet }ontea, from
around our hearth-satones should as
send silent and fet.vent prayers to
Heaven for the repose of the spirits
of the gallant dead of the 14th Sep
tember. Let the rernemberance of
them and their deeds live forever in
our hearts, fresh and green.

The Rev. Dalzell telegraphs as fol

Tile magnitude of the ealamity to
day is so awful that the wildest con
sternation and contausion prevail.
The dead cannot be buried. I have
juet sent a wagon with one box to
take tlhreeo dead children from one
house that the bodies may lie on the
giround out of doors until sonletlling

er is so ilnclement, totmorrow will be
worse than to-day. Our afftliction in
1873, was nothing to this. Send us
all the help you can. I am well.
The Scourge.
The yellow fever still prevails to
an alarming extent in New Orleans
and throughout Mississippi. At
Hickman, Ky., there has been 40
eases, while Memphis, Tenni., has
been almost delpopulited. The deaths
on Friday and Saturday last were
418. The towns anrd cities where the
disease prevails are nilfeliiig for want
of food, mlledicines, nurses arid Phv
