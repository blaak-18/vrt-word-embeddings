RED WING GOVERNOR
CANDIDACY PUSHED

J. K. Grondahl, Newspaper Man,
Former Legislator, Held Able
to Unite Party
—K-K-K
Red Wing, Minn.—Claiming that
Jens K. Grondahl, publisher and edi
tor of the Red Wing Daily Republi
can, is the only gubernatorial possi
bility, who could allign all the fac
tions of the Republican party in the
state, friends are launching a “Gron
dahl for governor” drive in all sec
tions of the state.
Plans are under way to organize
county and township Grondahl clubs
throughout the southern part of the
state, within the next few weeks, and
backers of the editor’s candidacy for
the Republican nomination are now
traveling through the state, working
up favorable sentiment for the move
ment.
Mr. Grondahl, although not making
any effort to stop this movement,
says he does not desire to become a
candidate, but followers of the for
mer legislator say that, if the nomi
nation is placed before him, he will
accept.
They point out that their prospec
tive candidate is the only possibility
in the Republican field who could weld
that party together, and that his work
in the legislature years ago would
carry him through a successful fight
against any candidate the Farmer-
Labor or Democratic parties could
produce.
They also say that Southern Min
nesota has no representation in the
state constitutional offices, and that
the section of the state is entitled to a
“chance the governorship.”
Among those who are active in
launching the candidacy of the editor
are: R. W. Putnam, Albert and Bar
ney Seiz, Harris F. Anderson, H. L.
Hjermstad, W. L. Bakkela, S. L. Kal
dem, N. C Lien, E. H. Lidberg and
H. E. Ulm, all of Red Wing; Dr. W.
J. Cochran, Lake City; Louis Carl
son and Ed Ackerman of Frontenac,

Arthur C. Townley founder and late
head of the Nonpartisan league, may
take a flyer in Minnesota politics on
his own account next year, according
to a report current among his friends.
The story is that he plans to run for
governor, but there is some question
whether ht would file in the Farmer-
Labor primaries or try for the Re
publication nomination.
Mr. Townley always has opposed
third party action and made a fight
last year both in Minnesota and North
Dakota for his “balance of power”
plan of working within the old par
ties. In a brokeif field of several Re
publican candidates for governor, he
would stand a chance of winning, it
is believed, even though most of his
political kind were in the Farmer-
Labor primaries.
Another report is that Mr. Townley
hopes to induce Senator Magnus John
son to run for governor next year and
in that event will run for the senator
ship himself. He is in Colorado
working on his new farmers’ organi
zation, and could not be reached to
affirm or deny the reports.
When he organized the Nonpartisan
league, Mi. Townley was a citizen of
North Dakota, but he was born and
brought up in Minnesota and for the
last three or four years has been a
resident of the Twin Cities. Though
more than once he has been declared
down and out in the affairs of the
Nonpartisan league, he has come back
each time and whenever there was oc
casion for it, he has shown his power
over the rank and file of the league.

PAPAL DELEGATE AT WHITE
HOUSE
By GILBERT O. NATIONS, Ph. D.
Washington, D. C.—The delegate
of the Pope to the United States,
Pietro Fumasoni-Biondi, recently
called at the White House and the
hierarchy of Rome is giving out to
the Roman press in its clip sheet
service at the National Capital the
Doastful statement that many con
gressmen, who were here before the
hyphenated Papal delegate had to
wait while he was immediately shown
into the President’s office and very
graciously received in an extended
audience. The statement of the hier
archy is in part as follows:
“When the delegate and his party
arrived at the White House, there
were many members of Congress
waiting to see the Chief Executive,
out the delegate was ushered into the
President’s office without delay.
President Coolidge received him most
graciously. He asked the Archbishop
regarding his previous service, and
on being told that he had served in
China and India, the President ques
tioned him concerning both of those
countries. On leaving the White
House the Papal delegate and his sec
retary posed for several photographs
in front of the mansion.”
Pope Leo XIII established the
Papal delegation at our National Cap
ital as a diplomatic station, but so
far our government has never offi
cially recognized the Papal envoy,
though it is accustomed to accord the
delegate many attentions and prefer
ments approaching perilously near to
recognition. The Pope now has reg
ular diplomatic relations with more
than half the civil powers.
The only possible reason for loca
tion of the Papal delegate in an im
posing mansion at 1811 Biltmore
street in the diplomatic section of
Washington is because the Pope re
gards him as a diplomatic envoy.
Washington city has no ecclesiastical
importance to the Church of Rome.
No Roman prelate is enthroned in the
Capital City. That city is a mere
suburb of Baltimore in the Papal sys
tem and all its Roman churches and
priests and institutions are subject
to the Archbishop of Rome enthroned
at Baltimore. But Washington is the
center and headquarters of American
politics. That is why the Pope lo
cated his delegate in the Capital City
instead of a Papal stronghold like
New York or Baltimore or Boston or
Chicago.

IT DOESH'T SURPRISE

—K-K-K
DO “CASEY’S” DEFRAUD THE
GOVERNMENT IN FINANCING
THEIR OFFICAL ORGAN?
—K-K-K
Since the Knights of Columbus
claim that they are law-abiding peo
ple, we are interested in getting at
die exact facts in what appears to be
a neat get-away with Uncle Sam, in
an evasion of the postal laws, says
Shuler’s Magazine.
We note in a recent number of
“Columbia,” the official organ of the
Knights oi Columbus, a statement of
their financial record during the past
twelve months. They announce a cir
culation of 775,000 in round numbers.
Their subscription price is SI.OO per
year. If these are bona fide sub
scribers, as the law requires, their
treasury would have received from
subscriptions the sum of $775,000.
The, law provides that in clubs not
less than 50 per cent of the subscrip
tion price must be charged.
Let us suppose that every sub
scriber on their bodks has been thus
obtained—then they would have re
ceived $387,500 in that manner.
The publishers of “Columbia” de
clare in their financial report that
they took in during the year $82,-
380.31 for advertisements carried in
the publication. Adding to this the
amount they would have received for
subscribers at the 60 per cent rate
which is the minimum the law allows,
they would have a total on their
books of $469,880.31. And yet the
financial report in question declares
that the total amount taken in dur
ing their entire legiimate operaions
was only $100,299.86.
The publishers concede in their re
port that they took in for subscrip
tions only $1,293.68. Here is some
thing for the United States postal au
thorities to look into—that is, unless
Rome has a special understanding
with the government by which she is
permitted to evade the law.
Certainly, some clever Casey might
have swiped $369,587.45. In that
event the publishers of “Columbia”
might write me a vote of thanks for
the suggestion. We observe that they
claim their entire expense for publi
cations for the year to have been
$405,916.49, which would leave them a
neat balance of $63,916.82, which they
could have used in combating the Ku
Klux Klan—that is, if they had real
ly received 50 cents for each sub
scriber, which is the least that the
law permits, and the advertising
amount which tfiey publish.
But whether it was poor business
methods or evasion of the law or
clean-cut graft, they announce a de
ficit of approximately $300,000. Evi
dently there is something as crooked
as a corkscrew somewhere. If we did
business that way, we* would be in
jail inside of a week.
Anyway, what’s a $300,000 deficit
to Rome, if she’s putting over prop
aganda? Why she can take it out
of the amount still on hand from the
war chest fund she collected from
Protestants, jsut before the war
closed, by the aid of the government.
And yet it would be interesting to
know whether Uncle Sam has been
“horn-swoggled” in the matter of the
taking- of these 775,000 subscriptions,
or whether some bright lad has laid
by a few' plunks out of the treasury.

The CALL OF THE NORTH
FORTY PROTESTANTS ARE DISCHARGED
BY U. S. SHIPPING BOARD. '
-k-k
Catholic Ax Is Wielded in Great Fury—Admiral
Benson Has Part—Same Tactics Used as
When Joe Tumulty Packed Board With
Men of Own Religion.
-k-k
WASHINGTON, D. C., Jan. 5.
Forty-six employes of the U. S. Ship
ping Board were separated from
their jobs last Monday and the Cath
olic ax was wielded with great fury.
In the number were five or six K.
C.’s, just enough in the big bunch of
Protestants to make it appear that
it wasn’t just a religious decapita
tion. Of course, the few Catholics
let out will find a way to be rein
stated, as has been the case so many
times, when their parish priest gets
busy with the powers that be. It’s
no secret that Catholic priests do
visit the shipping board offices
every time there are any favorites
let out and they invariably find a
way to get them back in again. In
the bunch let out this week were
eight good Masons; they will have
a hard time to secure reinstatement
for there is no secret that the ship
ping board is dominated and con
trolled by Catholics and Jews, just
as it always has been from the start
in the days when one Joe Tumulty
ran things in the White House and
had his brother Felix Tumulty scout
ing around daily in the shipping
board offices finding places for Joe.
to fit Catholics into fat jobs.
Admiral Benson Might Know.
The wholesale decapitation came
this week as a result of the decision
to make a $90,000 reduction in the
force and Department Chief D. A.
Burke just had to let them go in
bunches. Just why the shipping
board always manages to let the ax
fall on the necks of so many Prot
estants and so few Catholics is one
of the questions that one must guess.
Of course the fact that Admiral Ben
son is a Catholic and the head of
the Knights of Columbus in Wash
ington might have an important bear
ing on the situation. Then there is
Mr. O’Connor, a nice Irish name, with
Catholic written all over it, that
greatly assists the others on th'e
board; of course we must not over
’ook Mr. Lissner, who is a prominent
Jew member of Lhe board. It is a
fact, however, that there is one Pres
byterian member of the board and
still another member is said to be a
Mason, but there never was a time
when two could outvote three.
What a bloody time this Catholic
ax has had in the shipping board
since the World War. The Tumulty
crowd in its palmiest days had the
place packed with 15,000 employees
and now it is whittled down to about
3,000 of which number the writer is
assured is about 75 to 80 per cent
Catholic. When a Catholic is let out,
as a blind, he manages to get back,
for his priest is on the job within
a few cays. He makes no secret
about it; he goes right down to the
shipping board and demands action
and gets it. But when a Protestant
finds himself on the outside he is
out of luck.
Rip Snorting Masons
There was a time when the Masons
of prominence in the shipping board
were rather chummy; in fact, they
organized the Anchor club, and do
you believe it those fellows got into
the habit of going out to lunch to
gether? When Admiral Benson got
wind of it he said such a thing must
stop immediately. The iron fist came
down hard and the Masons had to go
to lunch one at a time and they were
lonely.
There was Commander J. G.
Journes, who is regarded as one of
the strongest Masons in the District
of Columbia. He was an ex-com
mander in the navy department and
down in the shipping board he was
made chief of the vessel distress sec
tion. His activities down there in
calling a spade a spade got him in
bad with the Benson crowd and the
first thing he knew his head had
dropped - into the basket. It’s still
there.
Former Acting Controller L. M.
Stevens was another Mason to go
and Ed Linz was another member
of the Masonic club to be on the out
side looking in. These fellows knew
too much of the inside workings and
now they have gotten better jobs
on the outside working where only
merit courts. They can go to lunch
with all the Masons in Washington
if they want to and no one to chop

off their heads. They now rank as
top notchers among the C. P. A.’s in
this city and wear no man’s collar.
Activities Were Too Many
Elmer Rogers was another active
Mason whcse activities yrere too much
for Tumulty and Benson. This good
old Hoosier from Logansport is now
making.big money working for him
self as a contractor on the outside
and he is piling up a bank account
which cannot be taken away from
him.
Oh, yes, Ray Worsham was an
other member of the Masonic club,
but he is lunching uptown now
adays where Masons can gather to
gether without being ousted from
their jobs. Mr. Worsham has gone
into business for himself and is mak
ing more money now than he made
in the shipping board.
Here’s another fellow, but the
writer isn’t going to divulge his
name for he is still on the job inside
working every day but Sunday. He
isn’t a Mason, but he is a good fel
low, anyway. His trouble is that
favorite Catholics are promoted
right over his head every now and
then. He has had several years’ ex
perience at sea in loading ships and
handling same. He knows his busi
ness. But that doesn’t count, espe
cially if he is a Protestant, which in
this case he is. The other day a
Catholic was put over him who has
never been on the ship and doesn’t
know the slightest thing about ships
or the shipping business. He ad
mits it and says:
“I don’t know anything about this
business; you go ahead and act, get
out the letters and I'll sign them;
you know this work and I don’t.”

NEW LIGHT SHED UPON
SISTER MARY ETHEL
—K-K-K
Klan Failure to Support Her After
Fight Shows Facts
—K-K-K
“The case of the reputed ex-nun
Sister Mary Ethel, which attracted
some attention several weeks ago,
in Kansas City, has been brought
again into the limelight by the ac
tion of her attorney, a prominent
Klansman of Kansas City, in'resign
ing from the Klan, alleging that the
Klan is fighting his client,” says the
Menace.
“Mrs. Steep, otherwise known as
Sister Mary Ethel, was attacked by
a Roman Catholic* woman named
Ghio, apparently without good cause,
and the newspaper reports at the
time stated that the Ghio woman was
tjie aggressor. Later inferential re
ports indicated that Mrs. Steep not
only defended herself but did a little
hair pulling on her own account. The
Menace was friendly to the lecturer
in our first and only notice of the
affair, basing our stand upon the evi
dent fact that the Romanist was of
fered the opportunity of speaking
from the platform in her own behalf
but refused and preferred to conduct
her side of the case with her nails
and fists.
“Subsequently it developed that the
alleged ex-nun did not claim to have
ever been an inmate of any convent
in this country, making it doubly
hard to disprove her claims to hav
ing been a real nun, but she did
claim to have been in a convent in
Burmah and in Manchester, England.
It also developed that she is in a
sense a protege of a certain profess
edly patriotic paper published in
southwest Missouri, and has been
conducting a Question and Answer
department in that paper intermit
tently from time to time.
“The Menace is receiving inquir
ies regarding his alleged ex-nun, to
none of which it is able to reply de
finitely. It is possible that she is
what she claims, but it is worthy of
note that prominent anti-Romanists
of England claim to have never
heard of her. It is just as well for
patriots to carefully consider the
possibilities which has resulted in
arraigning the Klan against her, be
cause it does not seem possible that
the Klan would oppose and assist
in the prosecution of any legitimate
ex-nun, unless such a person were
dangerously nihilistic and anti-Amer
ican.
“This ‘ex-nun’ may be working in
the interests of the circulation de
partment of the paper referred to,
and in that case the paper’s well
known anagonistic attitude towards
the Klan might also be considered.
It should be remembered that the
main owner of the paper in question
came out against the Klan a few
months ago and launched its own so
called ‘American Clan,’ accusing the
the head of the Klan of attempting
to turn the organization over to
Rome by admitting Roman Catholics
to the Order. Although this state
ment on his part was absolutely de
nied and he himself branded as a
traitor to the organization; he has hr
some time been trying to placate the
general membership and Sister Mary
Ethel seems to have been selected as
a fitting lieutenant to do the work.”
K-K-K
WHY THE ALARM?
Frost, in “The Outlook” for Decem
ber 26, continues his expose of the
Ku Klux Klan. He says, “the Giant
now strips for action.” He means by
this that it is insisting on its love of
peace, order and lawful redress of all
wrongs. He claims Evans has done
this to place the Order right with
the outside world, but doubts if* the
“reformation” be real. He intimates
that Imperial Wizard Evans is an ar
bitrary despot and the rest of the
Order blind followers.
Mr. Frost, however, says it is a
good plan we have followed, and
doubts if there is any good way to
break up the Order. He has learned
that the senseless propaganda of
Rome has brought us in more mem
bers than any other agency. He
fears the political powgr of the Klan.
We have but to close ranks and stand
firm for real 100 per cent American
ism to cause many moi*e of the oppo
sition to “see the strong man grous
ing himself from sleep” and prepar
ing to care for his own.

Dear Mr. Kerfoot:
I regret very much to note the fact
that you, as a representative Protes

ahead to realize the smallness of
your action in allowing your name
to be used in connection with such
an organization as The National Vig

While attending Hamline I al
ways thought of you with the deep

ing you discuss various subjects in
Chapel and elsewhere, and was great
ly surprised tq. learn from the daily
papers that a man of your calibre
and intelligence should be so easily
led by the un-American forces that
oppose the KU KLUX KLAN. I still
believe that there must have been
some misunderstanding, or that you
must have been misinformed as to
the work of our great organization
or you would not have taken the
stand that you have.
As a member of The Invisible Em
pire for some time, I am in a posi
tion to know whereof I speak, and
I say to you in all sincerity that I
have never seen any instance of law
violation or dishonesty in the work
ings of the Ku Klux Klan. If any
thing of the kind had happened, I
would certainly have discontinued my
membership.
Be fair, Doctor. Study up a little
on this organization and also on the
ones that are opposed to us, and I
know you will see the light and be
as great a booster for the Three K’s
as am I.
Yours truly,
