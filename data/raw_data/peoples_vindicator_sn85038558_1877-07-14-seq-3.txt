Editor People's Vindicator :
Quietly curled up in my corner with
my head between my paws, apparent- C
ly asleep, much that goes on in thei
world comes to my ears, and although
our owners regard domestic animals
as senseless olbjects, yet i assure yo i
that the superior race, so called, are 1
often severely criticized by those
creatures before whom no disguise is
thought needed. If you will hear a
with me, I would like to purr a little
concerning that class of humaun be
ings that my own race receive small
favor from, yet I bear them no t:al
ice, but would like to help them for
ward in their career. It was with
much gratification that I learned
through your columns, the prohibi
tion of minors drinking in bar rooms, t
saloons, &c. Your unwearied efforts t
having procured this result, do not
let the good work stop here. Pruge
the community to unite in winning
these youths to find pleasures in
higher and nobler pursuits. 1 do not
believe thatblovs are naturally vicious, I
despite the old time doctrine of total k
depravity. I aver that the majority n
who go to places of dissipation, do so
from lack of something better to do,
and from the perulicious examlple of
older men, These embryo sovereigns y
think it manly to swallow alcoholic
poison, and to strangle themselves
with the acrid fumes of tobacco. The
nature of youth craves vat icty,
amusement, change, and must have
it at any price ; they seek it as blind
ly as the Cuttlefish its prey in the
ocean, waving its deadly tentacles in
all directions,, closing upon all it
touches, and conveying to its ever
hungry mouth. flow wise then in
the ehlders of the people, the good 1
mothers and fathers, the loving sis
ters, to provide such innocent pleas
nres as shall make home the "dearest
spot on earth."
The narrow interests of small towns
and country neighborhoods are soon
exhausted, the dreary monotony cre
ates a tiger-like appetite for some ex
citement to break the stagnation, the
victim insensibly yields to the first
attraction that offers, often of a na
ture that makes the after life a via
concis. One potent cause of boys
going to the bad is, uncongenial
homes! Give an average boy a good
home, not merely a place to eat and
sleep, and change clothes in, but a
place where his society is liked, his
tastes appreciated, his affections
drawn out, where lie has the privilege
of inviting "the other fellows," a ref
uge in time of trouble, a spot where
lie may shout and sing if merry, or
sigh if lie he sad, and my word for it,
as a cat of experience, lie will love
his home better than any where else,
and make at good tman, perhaps a
great one. flow many unhappy
wretches, think you, have had their
swift descent to Avernus, arrested in
time to turn back on the perilous way,
by the remembrance of a happy home
-a father's pride, a mother's love ?
Boys shioutld hltrained to love their
own sister's better than other boy's
sister's, and gills s hould ble very kind
and sympathetic to their brotlhers.

VERNON.
PARISt OF VERNON,
July 1st, 1877.
I Dear Vindicator :
A press of business produced ciremn
stances which prevented tme from writing
to you last week, I hope that the same
will not occur againm. At my last writing
we were having entirely too much rain,
which continued through the entire week
sueeding my last letter. The crops of
this neighborhood were considerablly in
jured by so much rain, and niow, although
we have been scarcely ten days without
rain, I notice some corn wilting and
twisting up in mid day, on good landtl
too, but the ground was aso thoroughly
packed and beaten dlown by two weeks
heavy and almost daily rain, that a very
short time of dry and excessively hot
weather (such as the week just past has
been) will suffice to make corn wilt and
twist up. and that which is forward
must soon have rain again, or be injured.
F The crops throughoat Vernon parish
have been thought to be promisint, and
so far as my rnformation extenls, are
Scertainly good, particularly the corn on
sandy up-land, the blackland cotton is
also good, and some that I have seen is
tine, taken as a whole, I do not know
that the Vernonites have any right to
seriously complain at the outlook.
There was a shocking and terrible
shooting affray in the Eastern portion of
Vernon a few days since, in which one
man was killed and two more severely
wounded, perhaps mortally. The facts as
I obtained them, are as follows: A young
man by the uname of Bass eloped with
Sthe daughter of Jacob Ounter, who is a
resident of Rapidles. Bass brought the
girl across into Vernon, and left her at a
frieuns house and cmie up to Leesville

steal him." "You can't do it,"
said the clerk, "take hin out."
"Well, stranger, that's cruel ; but
you's both dispositioned alike, and
he's kinder company for you."
"Take him out !" roared the clerk.
"Stranger, I don't think you're
honest, and want watching. Here,
Dragon," he said to the dog, "sit
down here and watch that fellow
sharp," and turning on his heel,
said, "Ptt him out, stranger, he's
troublesome." The dog lay there
till the boat started, watching and
growling at every movement of
the clerk, who gave him the bet
