FINANCIAL MEASURE.
The Consideration of the Subject is
Expected to Bring Up Payment
of Chinese Indemnity in
the White Metal.
Washington, Jan. .0.-President
Roosevelt sent the following message
to congress:
"I transmit herewith a report from
the secretary of state with accompany
ing notes from the Mexican ambassa
dor and the Chinese charge d'affairs ad
interim, which ask co-operation of the
United States in such measures as will
tend to restore and maintain a fixed
relationship between the moneys of the
gold standard countries and the silver
using countries. I recommend that the
executive be given sufficient powers to
lend the support of the United States in
such manner and to such degree as he
may deem expedient to the purposes of
the two governments.
"THEODORE ROOSEVELT."
The message was referred to the com.
mittee on finance.
In his communication, Secretary
Hays says:
"It is not asked that the United
States modify its monetary system and
It is distinctly disavowed that any
movement is contemplated for the re
storation of international bi-metallism.
The opinion is expressed by the rep
resentatives of both governments that
consultation between the United States
and the European powers having de
peqdencies in the Orient and the in
dependent countries where silver mon
ey is in general use, may result In the
adoption of a monetary system which
will -prevent the great fluctuations in
exchange which now occur In trade
with the silver-using countries. If such
a result can be achieved, and it is point
ed out that at least a partial solution
has been proposed in the United States
in a bill now pending in the senate in
regard to the Philippine islands, great
benefits will follow to the trade of the
world by making easier the access of
the products of manufacturing nations
to the markets of China and the other
silver-using countries.
"The consideration of this subject
may have an important bearing also
on the -payment of the iademnity dure
-by China to certain European powers
and to the United States by enabling
atse Chinese empfre to put her monetary
#iem'- upon a bais' which will make
it ` BVsible for her to meet these pay
ments i .t manner sati factry to all
the, pwers. This result. it it eoUld be
asearylished. wotld ie of the arst im
Vti nee, rnot only to~ the United States
adto the other powers having a shya.
i9 the indemnity payments;. but to
China herself and her future develop
ment."

STOOD UP FOR QUAY.
Senator Foraker Said Ile Had a Right tc
Pursue Course Taken.
Washington, Jan. 30.-The senate
proceedings Thursday were unmarked
by any lively debates such as occurred
Wednesday. When the Rawlins resolu
tion calling on the secretary of war fog
the evidence in certain courts martial
cases in the Philippines was laid before
the senate. Mr. McLaurin of Missis
sippi urged its adoption.
He detailed certain acts of cruelty
on the part of the American soidiers
toward Filipino men and women, and;
said the senate should have the evj
deuce in such cases.
He remarked that it was easy to
say there was a syndicate of sla^der
and defamation in the senate toward
the army, but when the army was slan
dered, the American officers were slan
dered by showing them to have beau
guilty of outrages, and he argued that
they should be weeded out of the ser
vice.
The statehood bill was then taken up.
but Mr. Quay yielded to permit Mr.
Proctor to report the army appropria
tion bill, which he said he would call
up at the earliest possible moment.
A message from the president was
read in which he asked for the neces
sary power to co-operate with Mexico
and China regarding the restoration of
the parity of silver and gold. It was
referred to the committee on finance.
Mr. Lodge then concluded his re
marks in opposition to the omnibus
statehood bill, and Mr Bard of Cal:
fornia also spoke in opposition to it.
At tale conclusion of Mr. Bard's re
marks and just before the senate ad
journed Mr. Foraker, having the state
hood bill in charge in the temporary
absence of Mr. Quay, said from state
ments he -had received the action of
Mr. Quay Wednesday in Introducing
the statehood bill as proposed amend
ments to the agricultural and sundry
civil bills was regarded as an unheard
of proceeding. It was not unheard of
at all, he said: It was simply a ques"
tion whether a majority of the sen
ate could do a thing It wanted to.

Mr. Patetrson (Dem.) of Tennessee
took advantage of the latitude' allowed
in general debate on the poptofiwce bill
to "make. a set speech for. an hour And
a half on the trust ques1xiou.
