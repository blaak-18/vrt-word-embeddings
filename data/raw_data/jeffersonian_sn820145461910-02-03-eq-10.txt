light complexion; am five feet tall
and weigh eighty pounds. I am go
ing to school at Bethel now, and my
teacher’s name is Mr. Robert Alli
son. I study Geography, Arithmetic,
Word Book, Physiology and History.
I had a nice time Christmas. My
father is a devoted admirer of Mr.
Watson. We live on the farm. I
like to live in the country. My fath
er and myself each had a knife, and
liked them very much. I lost mine
at school, and was very sorry. lam
going to try to get up another club,
and get another knife. I like to read
The Jeffersonian very much. I have
four sisters and one brother. I am
Mr. Watson’s namesake. With best
wishes to Mr. Watson, The Jefferson
ian and Daddy Jim, I am—Guy Wat
son Harper, Murrayville, Ga., Rt. 1.
A VALENTINE BOY.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here I come
for the first time. I was born on
the 14th day of February. I will be
fifteen years old next February, so I
was my mother’s Valentine, fifteen
years ago. Washington was born on
the 22d day of February, and he was
a great man. I was named for Tom
Watson. He is a great man, always
has been, and will always be, so I
expect to be a great man also. I am
going to school and I am in the fifth
grade. My teacher’s name is Miss
Annie Shepard. I like her very
much, and am learning fast. If I
see this in print, I will come again.
I hope the waste-basket is covered
up.—Warner Watson Blakely, La
nett, Ala.
WRITE AGAIN.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Will you allow
a little country girl to join your hap
py band? My father takes The Jef
fersonian, and I like to read it very
much. I am ten years old, and I
have two brothers and one sister. I
go to school and like my teacher.
Her name is Miss Columbia Mann.
For fear of the waste-basket, I will
close. —Delma Sauls, Lyons, Ga.,
Rt. 1.
LIKES THE LETTERS.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I am a little
girl fifteen years of age. My father
is dead, and I live out in the coun
try. I like country life very much.
I go to school every day that I can.
My teacher’s name is Mr. Edwards,
and I like him very much. I am in
the seventh grade. We play ball
every day, and have a nice time. We
live about three miles from the
school-house. I also go to Sunday
school. I have three brothers and
one sister, and they are all older
than I, except one. I have light com
plexion, dark hair and blue eyes. My
stepfather takes The Jeffersonian,
and he likes it very much. I like to
read the letters from the little girls
and boys. We live about eight miles
from Choudrant, La. I will close.
Hope to see this in print.—Your
friend, Eula Sisemore, Choudrant,
La., Rt. 2.
ANSWERING MISS LURA.
Hello! Daddy Jim:—Here I come
again. This is my second time. I
am going to school every day. My
papa takes the weekly Jeffersonian
and thinks there is no other paper
like it. He says Mr. Watson is the
best friend we common people ever
had. I hope to see the day when
Mr. Watson will be elected President
of the United States. I will answer
Miss Lura Fields’ letter through The
Jeffersonian. I have dark complex
ion, black hair and eyes, and weigh
eighty-one pounds. Yes, it sort of
hurts my feelings to go to the field
when the sun is hot. I didn’t hang
up my stocking Christmas, as it had
a hole in the heel. It seems that you
Ghe □effersonlan
and I are twin sisters. We are the
same age. We ought to give one an
other a birthday present, the 15th of
April, oughtn’t we? I am not able
to answer your riddle, but will ask
you one: “Round as a nickel, and a
white spot in the middle.” I hope
to hear from you soon.—Jewell Ow
ens, Ellaville, Ga.
MORE RIDDLES.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here comes a
little Georgia girl to join your hap
py band. My papa takes The Jeffer
sonian, and I enjoy reading the chil
dren’s page. I thought I would write
a letter and answer some of the rid
dles. I will answer Bascom’s first.
It is a pair of shoes, and a wasp and
bee. Now, I will answer Jewell Ow
ens’. It is a broom. I will ask some
riddles; “Round as a biscuit, deep
as a cup, and all the king’s horses
can’t pull it up”; “Black and white
and red all over”; “Whitie in Whitie
and Whitie run Whitie out of
Whitie”. Now, if any one can an
swer these riddles, I will send them
a pretty post-card, and if I answered
the others right, please send me a
card. Daddy Jim, I will close for
this time. —Bertie Moon, Lawrence
ville, Ga.
ANOTHER NEW MEMBER.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here I come
for my first time to the Club. I am
eleven years old. My papa takes
both of Mr. Watson’s papers, and I
certainly enjoy reading them. I go
to school, and like it. I am in the
fourth grade, and have six studies. I
live in the country. I have seen so
many letters from the boys and girls,
until it makes me want to write. If
this letter does not reach the waste
basket, will come again.—From your
friend, Bertha Nunnally, Baldwin,
Ga.
A PRIZE-WINNER.
Hello! How are you? Daddy
Jim, I received my post-cards all
right, and am pleased with them.
They were so nice and had such
lovely verses on them. I received
them on Christmas Eve night. What
a good fellow you must be. The rea
son I say so, that you read all of the
letters you receive and I know that
must be. a lot of trouble. I won one
prize, and if I didn’t get the first, I
am glad to be on the winner’s list.
Bye-bye.—Eula Roberts, Tazewell,
Ga.
HAS SEVEN SISTERS.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I am a little
girl, nine years of age. Am in the
fifth grade, and my teacher’s name is
Miss Mattie Tyus. I have seven sis
ters, and we all like to go to school.
I think all girls should strive to get
an education. My papa is a farmer
and takes The Jeffersonian. I like
to read the Post-Card page. I will
now answer Bascom House’s riddle.
The first is a shoe, and the second
is a bee. —Yours very truly, Mattie
Pearl Lindsey, Forsyth, Ga., Rt. 4.
LIKES TO HUNT.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I am a little
boy, thirteen years of age, and this
is my first attempt to write. Uncle
Jeff takes The Jeffersonian and likes
it verv much. I have a fine hound,
and like to hunt very much. I will
ask a riddle: “I have a sheet of
checkered work, neither worn nor
spun, been a sheet for seven years
and not a thread begun.” I think
the answer to Miss Jewell Owens’
riddle is a broom. I will close with
much love to Daddy Jim.—Horace
Williams, Farmington, Ga.
WELCOME TO THE CLUB.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Hello! here
comes a little brown-eyed eight-year
old girl. I never saw my papa. He
died before I was born. I live in the
city, but I am visiting my grand
father in the country. He takes The
Jeffersonian. Mamma says that I
nearly go crazy about reading the
little folks’ letters. We all think a
lot of Mr. Watson, and mamfha used
to try to vote for him, when she was
little, like me. If you want to hear
from grandpa, let The Jeffersonian
get lost. Mamma has heard Mr.
Watson speak three times. I wish I
could hear him some time. I hope
that I will see this in print, and get
a prize of some kind.—Ben Irene
Salter, Bartow, Ga., Rt. 3.
IT ESCAPED.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here comes a
South Georgia girl to join your band
of boys and girls. The old year has
gone with its sorrow and gladness,
and the new year has come again. I
like the South fine for farming, but
there is one time in the year I do
not like, and that is the winter, when
the people burn off the woods, and
there is such an awful smoke. We
came from North Georgia. I like to
ramble among the hills and moun
tains. I go to school, and mv teach
er’s name is Professor J. Stems. I
like him, but think he is too plain in
some things. Mv papa takes the
Magazine and Jeffersonian, and I
like them both. How many of you
hoys and girls like fruit? I do. We
have two pear orchards, a plum and
peach orchard, so I pat a lot o F fruit.
With best wishes to The Jeffersonian
and honing that this will escape the
waste-basket. —I am, Mary L. Pat
rick, Tifton, Ga.
A BAD ACCIDENT.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here I come
again. I had a bad accident the oth
er day. I mashed my thumb between
the cogs on pana’s rinsaw machine.
The doctors bad to give me chloro
form, so that it would not hurt while
they were fixing it up. It was fortu
nate that it was mv left hand. I can
not go to school, so I thought that I
would write, to pass away the time.
I have a riddle to ask; “Luke has
it in fmnt. Paul bad it behind, ladies
and girls have it, men and bovs have
not got it and never will have it; but
the old man McMnlligan bad it bad
in two places.” Wishing The Jeffer
soninn much success.—l am, Weaver
