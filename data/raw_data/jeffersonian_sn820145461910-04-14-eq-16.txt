The Duties of a Democratic
Committee
Below is a sensible editorial. It’s
democratic, like Pleas Stovall always
writes. But it cuts such men as
Charlie Edwards and Bill Brantley
to the core.
That’s not all. Congressmen can
desert the Democratic party like
those fellows did in the organization
of Congress and thus help old Joe
Cannon, but cannot lead these Geor
gia crackers into the Republican
party. When these farmers wake up,
as they now will, they will leave the
bolters at home.
The following is an editorial from
the Savannah Press:
The Macon Telegraph scores some
one in the County Democratic Execu
tive Committee, of Ware for intro
ducing resolutions condemning Con
gressman Brantley’s course in Con
gress.
So far as we remember the reso
lutions read before that committee,
too late for any action, referred only
to Mr. Brantley’s vote in the House
last March to sustain Speaker Can
non, when Democrats and Insurgents
commenced their fight upon the
Speaker. It was the same fight which
has just been fought with such tu
multuous consequences in Congress,
and this time Mr. Brantley stood up
with his party and voted with the
Democrats. If he had done so then
there would probably have been the
end of Cannonism before he injected
so much harm into the tariff bill.
Mr. Brantley is a leader in Con
gress. He is a man of force, experi
ence and ability. There was more
surprise and regret over Mr. Brant
ley’s position than over any other
Southern vote because of his promi
nence and influence in the South.
The Press expressed that sentiment
at the time. Hundreds of Democrats
said so in Georgia. So far as we
can see or hear no one in this sec
tion has any other criticism to make
of Mr. Brantley’s course in Congress.
It is not condemned. His speeches
and votes have voiced mature states
manship. If the Macon Telegraph
will read the Ware county resolu
tions as they were printed in The Sa
vannah Press it will note that the
protest was as clear-cut as it was
emphatic. The Cannon vote was the
piece de resistance pure and simple.
The Macon Telegraph, which does
not print the resolutions at all, dis
misses them as entitled to no more
weight than the opinions of one man.
And yet the Macon Telegraph gives
them an editorial of half a column.
We have heard it said that their
introducer showed them to several
members of the Democratic Execu
tive Committee; that a majority of
the members seemed to approve of
them; but that before the resolu
tions were read a number of mem
bers of the committee had left the
room after attending to the details
of the coming primary elections and
a quorum of that committe was not
on hand.

utive committee. Let us see. The
County Democratic Executive Com
mittee met for the purpose of fixing
the date for the county primary and
for the transaction of such other
business as might come before it. It
was a Democratic committee. It pre
sumably had the good of the party,
State* and National, at heart. Mr.
Brantley was elected as a Democrat
to Congress and his vote in the
House March 15th, last, has been
challenged as not in line with the
Democratic minority in Congress.
We can see no impropriety in calling
upon a Democratic committee for a
Democratic expression. It may be a
vital matter. The Macon Telegraph
insists that the functions of a Demo
cratic committee are to execute the
will of the party in the matter of
rules and regulations. If a Congress
man, for any reason, has failed to
execute the will of the party in the
House in the matter of rules and
regulations, what then? It is true
that the Ware county Democratic
Executive Committee took no action.
But such action would not have been
improper or ultra vires. Democracy
has ceased to be an empty name and
executive committees are no longer
dummies. The importance of keep
ing Democrats in line has just been
shown in Washington. The party
has won a great victory in the House.
It can win a greater victory at the
polls next November. Once more we
ask the Macon Telegraph:
Who shall stay the coming of
Philip if Athenians abandon Greece?
A week before this action in Way
cross the Democratic County Execu
tive Committee of Wayne county
met in Jesup and endorsed Congress
man Brantley for re-election. We did
not see any protest from the Macon
Telegraph against this action as im
proper or revolutionary, did we? —

Pertinent Vaccine Points
The Pro-Vaccinators —those who
advocate vaccination may be divided
into two classes:
1. Those who do not know any
thing about it.
2. Those who make money
through it.
The anti-vaccinators —those who
oppose vaccination are all in one
class:
1. They know all about it, and
spend their money to get rid of it.
Those who are ignorant of the
subject, but who support it, because
it has become the custom and they
are told it is the right thing to do,
are to be pitied, and require educa
tion —they are simply like a flock of
sheep being driven to the slaugter
pen.
Were it not for the vast financial
gain derived from vaccination, it
would not exist.
The tremendous income derived
from this practice by its advocates is
beyond conception.
So great is the money value of
this practice, that it has become
THE one great and only medical (?)
prescription that has received the
support of legislative enactment
throughout the civilized (?) world,
and compulsory laws have been
made to increase this money value,
and support the hungry horde of
Grafters.
A few years ago it was estimated
that not less than TWENTY MIL
LIONS OF DOLLARS was invested
in the so-called “vaccine farms” of
the United States, and there is no
telling how great it is today.
This vast investment must pay
dividends.
Therefore!—every possible IN
DUCEMENT is made to ignorant
and (or) mercenary Boards of
Health (?), Boards of Education (?)
and other “influential” or “useful”
organizations to vaccinate.
Now, the “Common People” at
large do not want vaccination —
hence, Compulsion!
Gift SJftfferjsonian
The famous Col. Sellers, with his
wonderful “Eye Water,” was not a
patch to the Vaccine Fiend.
Eighty millions of people in this
country alone —eighty millions of
vaccinations —millions more born
every year—millions more to be vac
cinated every year. Think what this
means! And then the revaccina
tions!
Every vaccination costs the peo
ple of this country from $5.00 to SSO
in cold hard cash, and God alone
knows how much more! How? In
the first cost of the vile stuff. In
payment of the vaccine doctor’s fees.
In medical attendance afterwards.
In loss of time, service and labor of
the victim. In undertakers’ charges.
In graves and tombstones.
The cost of vaccination to the peo
ple of the United States would more
than pay all the profits of the Stan
dard Oil Trust, the Steel Trust and
the Sugar Trust combined.
Is it any wonder that those who
are supporters of this stupendous
Poison Trust should stand together
and oppose every effort to destroy it?
That the compulsory vaccination
laws are illegal and unconstitutional
is unquestionable—but the fact re
mains that the are enforced, because
the victims —the “Common People”
—have permitted their “public serv
ants” to become their “masters.”
Once let the compulsory laws be
abrogated—and vaccination will fall
into desuietude —in ten years there
will be no vaccination and NO
SMALLPOX.
This is w T hat the Poison Trust —
the Vaccine Fiends fear.
That vaccination will prevent
smallpox is nothing but a supersti
tion. ,
More than one hundred years of
practice of this vile superstitious
rite has failed to show a single in
stance where vaccination has pre
vented smallpox, except when it kill
ed the victim before he could be at
tacked by smallpox!
This statement is absolutely un
qualified, and the advocate of vacci
nation is challenged to show PROOF
to the contrary.
Not a single claim or statement
that has ever been made in support
of the rite of vaccination, as to its
benefit in preventing or getting rid
of smallpox, has ever been substan
tiated —but has been refuted time
and time again, and the Falsity,
Fraud and Failure of the horrible
thing is writ large in history.
