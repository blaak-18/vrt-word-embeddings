Paramaribo, Surinam. Jan. 5.-In 1595
Valter Raleigh, knight, poet, explorer
tnd enthusiast, lunded on the north
east coast of South America and jour
leyed many weeks through the land of
?ulana, called after the name of a
treat Indian tribe in that region. There
Were many hundred thousands of these

suiana, British, Dutch and French.

Brave and gallant Sir Walter sailed up
:he fivers of this great Guiana to find

Sir Walter Italeigh and his fearless
crew found swalImps. mountain tor
rents, sunkes, venomous insects by the

a snake or mosquito could penetrate,
but not El I Iorado, never El D)orado.
Broken in healith by the hardships of
their quest, they gave it up and re
turned to Emch:lnd. Fifty-seven years
later the EnlTlish made a settlement in
this Guiana territory. They called their
coloney Surreyhlani. shortened soon to
Surinam, and that is the official name
today of the o4idinv planted by the
English, tradetd by tlym to the Nether

after a prolonged absence from the
United States. No one who did not
know his habits would have suspected
him of being a successful author re
turning from a trip abroad. He wore a
wrinkled sack coat, the pockets of
which bulged with letters and papers.
His trousers were bagged at the knees.
He was minus a vest, and his outing
shirt was far from immaculate. A
leather belt around his waist took the
place of suspenders. On his bead le

A Home Dellwht and How to Have It
In Perfection.
The tea table habit is it gracious one
to cultivate. The influence of this t:ny
board makes for rest and meditation,
for hospitality, for friendship and( heor
in the daily journey. If madam comes
in late from shopping or calling, cold
and tired, what is so refreshing and
comforting as a cup of the hot amber
liquid? It the witching ten hour is thie
appointed time for the meeting of a re
fractory committee, do not the ideas
flow with the tea, and under the grace
inspiring influence of the goodly aroma
do niot differences and Irritations steal
awtry? If the day is dark and dreary
and duties press, and you feel I that
your doll is indeed stuffed with bran.
try a cup, my dear! 'Tis a great re
storer of serenity, soothing in effect
like unto a man's after dinner cigar.
But-alas, there are always "buts"--do
not rush through the ceremony in a
"one more thing done" fashion. Let the
busiest woman lay aside her work. re
lax body and mind. take an easy chali
between the softly crackling fire and
the little table and whether alone or in
the company of family, friend or book
sip a tranquilizing cup of the orient's
best. It is blessed "lost time!"
A fine quality of black tea is consid
ered best for general use. iii c'uring
green tea the leaves are' steamed as
soon as gathered. In the case of black
tea the leaves are allowed to ferment
before drying. The result is that the
finished black tea contains far less tan
nin than the green. The original t-at
leaf possesses an oxidizing principle
which is destroyed in the steaming
process. but which oxidizes the tannin
during the curing of black tea and
gives it its color. -But, whether hyson
or souchong, orange pekoe or English
breakfast, do not use cheap tea or
dusty tea, or tea whose bouquet you
cannot enjoy. Do not allow it to steep
till instead of the -essence and fra
grance the deadly bitterness and black.
ness are "yours for indigestion." And
above all never conduct your gentle
ministrations with a metal teapot as an
alIy, solid silver excepted. Any other
metal kettle is permlssible for heating
the water alone. The chemiieal action
after the tea is added is what makes
miie ef--and poison.
