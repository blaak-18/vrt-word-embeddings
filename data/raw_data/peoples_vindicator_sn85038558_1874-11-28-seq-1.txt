Sister! we have longed to speakitI
We have waited long to save i
We have yearned to speak the welcome
' "Enter-.be no more a slaver'
Every tear. that full, we saw it,
As we braced to meet the shock ;
Now! Come in-the door is open,
Sit thou here by Plymouth Rock I
We have seen thee all disheveled, .
Seen thee bend with trembling lip,
When the men who should have loved
thee
Raised again the lrutal whip.
But we knew their day was coming;
As we know their day has come ;
Ring their doom, Louisiana I
Massachusetts drives them home!
Queen then wort is all thy sorrow;
Qtteet4thou shalt be yet in pride,
Many4throned Columbia calls thee
When her queens sit side by side.
And thy regal robes are ready,
And thy crown is on the throne,
For we knew our Cinderella
Would comeback;to claim her own.
Nevermore shall one be driven
To the desert: nevermore
Shall the children of the Union,
On their brethren bar the door.
God be thanked for love grown stronger;
Heart and hope go hand in hand,
WVe are North and South no longer
But a great United Laud !
Origin of the Maxseillaise.
The story of the origin of the Mar
seillaise hymn has frequently been
told, and is probably generally known,
but the romance with which' it is in'
vested is so well rendered by Lamar
tine that it will bear repetition par
ticularly at a time when the world is
interested in everything belonging to
the nationality of the country
of which it is the national hymn. La.
martine tells as that "there was at
this time-1792-a young officer of
artillery in the garrison at Strasburg.
His name was Rouget do Lisle. He
was born at Lons-le-Saulnlo r in the
Jura, a country of reveries and euer
gy, as mountainous regions always
are. Thistle young man loved war as
ened the tediousness of the garrians
Generally sought on account of his
double talent as a musician and a po
et, he became a familiar visitor to
the house of an Alsatian patriot, Diet.
rich, mayor of Strasburg. The wife
and daughters of Dietrich shaied his
enthusiasm for patriotism and revo
lution. They loved the young of
ficer. They inspired his heart,. his
poetry, and his musicle and 'trusting
to the early lispings of hit genius,
they were the first to execute his
scarcely expresed thoughts. It was
in the winter of 17t2; famine reigned
in Strasburg, the Dietrich' family
were poer, and their table was frugal,
but it was always hospitable to Roe.

cAN CorP.-We copy as foflows from
Watts & Co.'s Liverpodl Circular of
the 23d nit. Ii will be seen that they
don't think auch of our staple this
year in England.
We have this week examined a
sample of cotton from Northern Tex
as, which is but little, if any, better
to point of staple than Bengals. the
lowest quality of East India cotton.
Thissample *as bright and clean, and
fronm appearance would have classed
nearly good middling but the staple
was so very short and woolly that its
nominal mtrket value was td to 7id.
We fear that much of the crop grown
in all those sections where the drought
was so very severe in August last
will prove to be somewhat similar.
We would advise our friends to ex
ercise great caution in handling such
cotton. Last season we heard a good
deal about "the excellent quality of
the Anmerican erop, its redloed waste
and better expending value," that is,
the large per entage of yarn which
it would yield in proportion to the
weight of raw material, The crop of
1873--4 certainly was a good stapled
one,bbat If the erop of thie season is
as poor as we now bare reason to be.
lieve it is, this should he taken into
account in future calculations. -
