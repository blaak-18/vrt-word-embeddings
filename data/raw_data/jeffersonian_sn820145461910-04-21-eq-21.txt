THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE OTHERWISE
AND A FEW LACONICS
: By L. A. L.
BASE BALD, ATHLETICS AND
MORALS.
The “Great American Game,” base
ball, began its official season last
week in nearly every city of any
size in the different leagues.
As a money-maker for the men
who finance the game, it is running
the theatrical trust a good second;
and as a health giver, to those who
witness it and to those who play it,
all the other health-givers are wind
ed at the post.
Athletic prowess of any sort de
mands perfect physical condition.
A glance at the star players of
base ball, shows many men beyond
their fortieth year.
The point is obvious.
The average business man of forty
is fat, puffy under the eyes, flabby,
nervous and, as a rule, dispeptic—
which means irritable.
The professional base ball player
is bright-eyed, clear-skinned, alert,
good humored and hard as nails.
The man who smokes cigarettes,
drinks everything, from near beer to
gin-rickeys, tarries on the great
T ”’ Lc way and eats lobsters with
chorus girls, couldn’t last one in
ning of a ball game.
And the people who go to see the
ball games—how much could their
benefit be assessed at?
Every little rooter able to raise
the price or gouge a knot hole in the
fence, is filled with the desire to
grow into a Delahanty, a McGraw, or
any other of the “stars” who have
made base ball what it is today.
And the old players, those who
have retired because of dropsical
pocketbooks and cumbersome real
estate, they will tell you how, in
their professional days, they laid the
foundation of the healthy, happy
middle age they are now enjoying.
And every school and college
whose “track team” is the glory of
every scholar, is the means of devel
oping better physical conditions and
a desire for better moral living, than
all the theologues who ever came
down the pike.
The people of the United States of
America head the statistical list in a
large number of undesirables, but it
also leads in the percentage of suc
cessful athletes, and it is in a class
by itself on base ball.
So, to every employer whose office
boy kills a dozen or so grandmothers
each season, to every parent whose
son forgets to do the chores;
to every teacher whose pupils
“forgot” to get their lessons; to
every man and boy who is interested
in this great game, we would say:
Realize its value as a giver of health,
an incentive to high morals, and as
standing for all that is desirable in
American citizenry, and the interest
on the money laid out, either in sal
aries for the players or tickets of ad
mission for the spectators, will be
more than trebled in its returns.

Milwaukee is famous again, and
some more —it has resurrected Eu

What do the tariff tinkers think of
Canada putting the ban on pulp wood
exportation?

And the joyous sound of “play
ball” was heard last week all over
this great and glorious U. S. A.

Queer what a change of heart some
Congressmen have had since the anti
railroad pass law became effective.
“Pittsburg grand jury takes a
slight rest,” says a news item. Yep,
they need it, but tonics are what
they’ll be taking later on.

Chinamen in New York are keep
ing the coroner busy; that is, the
live ones are providing dead ones for
the officials.

Uncle Joe Cannon wants to have
an automobile; all right, let him
have it, and use the hot air he’s
been wasting on Congress to run it.
* * * *
Another thing about these bribery
cases is, a lot of men are becoming
famous who would rather have re
tained the violet’s shrinking modesty.
* * * *
A newspaper speaks of “the hu
morous side of Cannon’s career.”
Some folks would need a microscope
to find it, but he’s a joke now, all
right.
* * * *
Mr. Cannon emphatically declares
he will not resign, and dares the in
surgents to vote him out. Which
shows the old man’s fighting power
is at par.

Birmingham, Ala., has struck the
proper gait when it demands more
five and ten-acre truck farms near
the city. Other cities would do well
to follow the suggestion.

Mr. Peary has decided to quit “ex
ploring.” As Dr. Cook doesn’t seem
to be willing to remain in the lists,
even as an alsQ-ran, this looks like a
wise move on Mr. Peary’s part.

Mr. Roosevelt has doubtless had
an unabridged version of the Pinchot-
Ballinger controversy, and it’s quite
possible President Taft’s ear burned
during the telling.

To show their resentment for any
revision of old foot ball rules, a
squad playing “revised” foot ball
broke several ribs of the tackle, just
to show it could be done so easily.

Mr. Hotchkiss, superintendent of
insurance, of New York, in a recent
speech demands better political con
ditions. If they ever are better, its
a cinch the insurance graft will
shrink.
* * * *
Under the Taft regime, social af
fairs affecting any part of the house
are regarded as important; so the
engagement of the Taft cook and a
policeman on the beat is duly chron
icled by the Washington press.

A Minnesota preacher condemns
“rag-time preaching;” i. e., preach
ing on sensational topics; now if an
other would condemn the vaudeville
features some churches have adopt
ed, maybe they’d save more souls.
* * * *
Senator LaFollette is “dead set”
against consolidating railroads. To
some of the unenlightened it seemed
as though they had all been consoli
dated as much as the water in the
stock would permit.
* * * *
The determination of railroads to
exclude women hereafter as em
ployees isn’t a reflection on the
ability of the women as workers, but
because most of the women get mar
ried just when their efficiency makes
them most valuable.
* * * *
An English High Brow has stated
that some women read a novel a day.
Huh —if that man only knew that
the average woman “skips” till she
reaches the pages where “he said”
and “she replied,” and “her gown
was,” etc., he wouldn’t be alarmed
nor uneasy.

Two farmers, brothers, in West
Virginia, have met death in the same
manner; each lay down on a railroad
track to sleep. Five years ago the
first brother tried the stunt —success-
fully from the undertaker’s point of
view.

We are told John D. Rockefeller
was greatly shocked recently because
the little boys were playing marbles
on the street on Sunday. Has it been
recorded yet that John D. has piously
refused to accept the interest on his
money which gathers on the Holy
Day?

Chicago and New York have a
fresh topic to fight on; the butter fac
tories declare New York gets all the
first-class butter, and the Windy City
gets the second grade. Great suds,
we poor little fifth-rates must be eat
ing candle grease then.

The Boston Herald solemnly ad
vises thus; “Whether you are male
or female, be careful how you an
swer the census enumerator, espe
cially as to whether you are head of
a family.” And right there is where
many a poor henpecked man is going
to loom big, for the first (and only)
time.

The peculiar sight of an open air
auction sale of liquor in a “prohibi
tion” city, and a “prohibition” State,
was witnessed in Atlanta recently.
Uncle Sam’s deputies w'ere the auc
tioneers, and the liquor was contra
band. But it’s a queer state of af
fairs, isn’t it?
* * * *
Some of the Senators in Washing
ton have begun to “view with alarm”
the tremendous amount of unfinish
ed business before Congress. One
member plaintively stated he “hoped
to get home by the fifteenth of June.”
This will probably give an inkling of
the sort of legislation we may ex
pect.

No one can accuse us of being
finicky in the matter of speech, but
the sainted Codfish on Boston’s City
Hall must have lost its scales could
it have read this, in the Boston
Herald of recent date:
“Now let the one-armed veteran
have a larger appropriation and more
assistance, so that he can deal out
adequate relief with both hands —to
his needy and deserving comrades of
1865.”
