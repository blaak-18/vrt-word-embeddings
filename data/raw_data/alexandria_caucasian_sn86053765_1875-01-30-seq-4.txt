eccentrie rtf.iU Vïîjtl hud a passion
for collecting strange animals nrid
domesticating (hoin(bii his fand. Hit)
HdcccsH wrthHi'e or fs rf hUirlr
iildo. A fmv yojirs ago lio bonglit.
one of those reptiles of a noa captain,
who JtfFotiglit it North
yodng. Being frilly accliVnrttodn,
snow storm only amuses tlio reptile,
whilu the cold air of tho North great
ly adds to tlio toui;hnofj3 ol Mb bitle.
The hoys have often struck it with a
pixaxc with «bout as unich effect as
if bad beeu a«tdeam boiler.
This alligator is as cccentric as il h
master ; but it is the best disposed
animal in tbo world. It will work
in a threshing maeliiiio ten hours u
day, but if overtaxed . its mouth
opinis sarcastically.
Next to eating barn, its chief de
Jight js,to go wilb tbo boys-to the.
rivor, where il waits, j ntitit they dis
robe ; then it plunges in and allows
them to rido on its back. Onco a
water moccasin bit a lad and lied to
its bolo. The alligator throw the
boy out on tlio bank with his tail,
then turned its attention to that se -
pent's abiding phtco with its 'mouth
wide open and its eves red with rage.
Not less thuu eighteen.» moccasins
were lying dead at the boy's feet be
fore ho could eonut six. Tlie-nlW^n
tor sot, up a terrific bowl of exulta
tion. Putting tiro boy astride ilf<
biutk, and the "snakes in its jaw if
started for the house at. the top of
its speed. Fortunately the lad was
not dtingervtnljjlinjured. '< M Töilip
pins rewarded the feptilo with a box
of soap grease and a young pig.
K#cltppjr|ng itfi scales anV renova
ted wifh h cold chisel. Tliis little
feature in> its toilet, please« it im
mensely, and it capers around fur an
hour afterwards. It lifts a singu
lar fancy for a mule belonging to the
Colonel, and the mule returns the
feeling with ardent sincerity. 'J hev
often feed together in the nunc past
ure. AVbilo the mule searrfces f r
thistles and briar brushes, Iho alli
gator rega'lefi itself with toads and
fence lizards. Once the mule mired
in a marsh watching it catch a black
snake. He was on the point of
perishing when the alligator pried
him out, with its tail. Sioce then be
b is the alligator ti.de ( on his back,
and they are as fond of each other as
a couple of calico Fittens.
Children are great favorites with
the reptile. They pive him cl#cse
and cranberries, mid bits of roast,
chicken on their way to,.school, while
it keeps a sharp look-out for tlx;
cross dops that may follow them.
The blacksmilh'p boy avJio trims
its scales, is : a particular friend.
Last March w hen they were unusu
ally thick he chiseled circular places
in its hide and insertçd a cheap,bull's
eye clock bn either Wfi? of it, and
wedged ttieirf fast,. At first the, ani
mal was uucasy, brtt when it heard
the licking, its delight was unbound
ed, and it waddled oil to show itself
to the school girls.
Recently its teeth became so dull
that it could hardly chew, and it
whined piteously. Tlio blacksmith's
boy gave it a couple of torn cats and
led it to the shop, where lie filed the
tenth to a keen <dge. The animal was
so overjoyed, tlilit* it rim out, and
gnawed down a bitching-post, and
gobbled up a stray pog that Was pas
sing. Since then the alligator makes
monthly visits to the shop for repairs.
When its lower teelh are done, it
turns over 011 its back and opens its
mouth like the gulf of despair, while
the boy puis a buzz-saw finish on
the upper row.
Strange is it that we find in the
columns of tlio Inter-Ocean and
Tribune of Chicago, statements that
this and that citizen is poing to New
Orleans " with bis family" to spend
the winter months, or "attend the
Mardi Gras festival." These papers
describe New Orleans as possessing!
" an atmosphere of blood and assas- i
sination," the streets are described!
as full of assassins, and after dark, |
i] is reiterated, it is positively unsafe
unsafe to be out. Is it passible that
Chicago families can go to such a
desperate community with a view to
health and pleasure ?— [ÜQHric'rJour- :
