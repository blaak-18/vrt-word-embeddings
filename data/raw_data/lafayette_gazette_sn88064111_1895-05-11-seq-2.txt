lums in Patterson. Right, brother,
hoodlumism should not be tolerated.
: It belongs to a past age.
President Cleveland has decided to take
the U. S. mints out of local politics, by per
a nting all mint officials.-New
Whenever an old politician gets
- too pure to appoint other politi
t. cians to office with the ostensible
S'purpose to take the office out of
;politics, he will bear watching.
Some papers and politicians have
-: a great deal to say about ballot re
.form. Among the latter we find
some of the most brilliant election
thieves in the country. Men who
-have always excelled in the art of
billot-box stuffing are posing to
day as political purists. This is all
bosh; there is not an honest man in
the State who is not an advocate of
fair elections.
As usual before an election
the question of representation has
been brought up. No matter how
thoroughly or how satisfactorily
that question pnay be and has been
settled, there are always some who
think that they can do it better, or
else work it to their advantage.
However, at present, the representa
tion is fixed, and so it will stay, at
least until the next election is over,
so there is no use kicking.
To kiss or not to kiss is a ques
Ltion at present agitating the fair
!t1dies -of the Viennese stage. A few
".. `days ago one of the most beautiful
and accomplished actressess in
Vienna was discharged for refusing
to give a real kiss while on the
stage. Iquiry among the ladies
has shown that those in favor of
the real article are very much in
the majority.
The killing at New Orleans of
Dr. Hiriart by Dr. Schwing of
Plaquemines was a most deplor
able. affair, but our sympathy goes
to the slayer who acted like any other
man would have acted under the
same circumstances. Men like Dr.
Hiriart should always be prepared to
meet a violent death. No punish
ment is too severe for the man who
wrecks his friend's home.
The tfact that the use of rice as
feed has passed the experimental or
probationary stage, as evidenced by
the Jennings farmers' experience, it
ought surely to become the rule
with all Louisiana farmers, at any
rate those in the rice districts, to
give up the importation of the most
costly grain feed, and to confine
themselves to the home growth.
If this were done, the Westlake
News vouches for it that Southwest
Louisiana would save at home an
nually $ioo,ooo more or less for
feed stuffs.-Times-Democrat.
Great Britan has occupied the
port of Corinto for the purpose of
collecting the customs in order to
force Nlicaragtra to pay $75000 in
demnity for expelling Consul Hatch
from her territory, besides offering
indignities to other British subjects.
Nicaragua has protested against it,
and declared Corinto a closed port,
at the same time cutting Corinto off
from all communications with the
interior. This move has compli
eated matters very much, and the
next move of Great Britian is
awaited with much interest.
The New York Sun nominates
Senator John T. Morgan for the
Democratic party's candidate for
President iu x896. Senator Mor
gan is one of the greatest of Ameri
can statesmen, one of the greatest
of American patriots and would
make one of the wisest of American
presidents. But he could never
hope that the Northern people
whom he fought in the war of seces
sion, would lay aside old sectional
animosities long enough to vote for
him to be one of Lincoln's suc
cessors. The Sun is- in dead
earnest, but it is simply off its base.
-Minden Signal
"The crime for being a bachelor"'
says the States, "is to be punished
in several States, and among them
Olinois. It seems that the purpose
of the law recently passed by the
Illinois Legislature is to encourage
,matrimony and iucrease mtisery.
A bachelor, however, who can
prove that he has proposed, mar
riage- three times, but was; rejected
in each case is exempt from punish
Smeat. There is a good chance for
'some enterprising women in Chica
i go to ~pake money hand over fist by
s blishing a Bureau of Female Re
- on, to which the bachelors
aply and get their clearance
in the event that they are
for not complying with the
IT IS WIROAG.
The Gazette believes that it will
be unfair to compel the people in
the additions to pay back licenses
and taxes. The members of the
Police Jury are all intelligent and
fair-minded men, and we have no
doubt that whenAthe matter is prop
erly laid before them, they will act
with the same fairness which has al
ways characterized their actions in
the past. It would be inflicting a
heavy burden on the people living
and doing business in the additions
if they were forced to pay the par
ish taxes an'd licenses for the years
1893, 1894 and 1895. Like people
in all sections of the country they
have suffered very much from the
general business depression, and
this is a most critical period for
them as well as for others. To
hold one's head above water to
day, is as much as the most pros
perous can do, and few, are there
who can do more. The merchants
and liquor dealears in the additions
should not be compelled to pay the
back taxes and licenses, and should
not be made to suffer for somebody
else's mistake for which they can
not be held responsible.
DUDOUSSA 7'S CONVICTION.
Numa Dudoussat will go the
penitentiary, the Supreme Court
having refused to grant him a new
trial. Dudoussat will be the first
alderman sent to the penitentiary
from New Orleans. If it takes the
courts of the Crescent city as much
time to convict each of the bood
lers as it did to convict Dudoussat
very little can be expected in the
way of municipal reform. Dudous
sat is a: poor man and is said to be
ignorant and was an easy prey for
the trap laid by the notorious Do
minick O'Malley. There is no
doubt as to his guilt, and he
should be punished, but if
the more influential of the
boodlers are allowed to go unpun
ished it will be an everlasting shame
to the officials of New Orleans that
they have singled out an insignifi
cant individual when others more
intelligent and more wealthy are
permitted to pursue their base and
corrupt avocation without even
being brought to trial. Let not this
be construed as a defense of Du
doussat for he has received nothing
but his just dues. He should have
been in the penitentiary long ago,
and while all will sympathize with
his unfortunate family, and regret
that he has placed himself in such
a sorry plight, every lover of good
government will hail will pleasure
the decision of the Supreme Court
which sends him to Baton Rouge
to expiate his crime. Let the good
work go on until every boodler in
New Orleans, iirespective of social
or financial standing, has joined
Dudoussat in the State penitentiary.
Let the juries speak. Let it be
known that ,bribery, committed by
the high or the low, is a crime pun
ishable by a term at hard labor.
Let it be known that the bribe-taker
and the bribe-giver are no better, if
not worse, than the horse-thief or
the defaulting cashier. Let the
crime of bribery be exposed in all
its horrors and the briber-giver be
pointed out as an enemy to society,
as dangerous as the highwayman
and the burglar.
While The Gazette does not wish
to take issue with or against the
women who wear bloomers, the fol
lowing verse from the Bible is given
simply for information:
"'The women shall not wear that which
pertaineth to a man-for all that do so are
an abomination unto the Lord, thy G(;od."
A bright contemporary remarks
that this does not apply to bloomers,
for no sane man has ever been
known to wear bloomers. Some
time ago a lady-writer in the Arena
claimed that breeches were original
ly worn by woman who have a per
fect right to wear them when they
see fit. Between the silver issue
and the bloomer questibn it is hard
to say which is the hardest to solve.
SUGAR.
The outlook for a considerable
improvement in the price of sugar
is very bright. The present dis
turbances in Cuba will undoubtedly
inter:ere very materially with the
sugar crop and thus curtail the
amount that is usually imported
from that island. Since Cuba is
one of the chief sugar producing
countries that furnishes sugar to the
United States, it can be readily seen
that a failure or short crop there,
means a raise in price for the
Louisiana growers. Besides, the
tariff will necessarily add that
amount to the value of the product
here. And since the large stock
bought by the Sugar Trust just
prior to the passage of the tariff, is
now all used up, the demand for
home sugar will therefore be
greater, and sugar must command a
better price than last year. Al
together the prospects a e very en
coura1ing for can..-grwcrowr.
A SPLENDID RECEPTION.
*The reception tendered the Louis
iana Press Association by the pen~
ple of Donaldsonville was marked
throughout by such an open-handed
hospitality that the members of the
association were made to feel per
fectly at home as long as they re
mained in the beautiful little city.
It is no exaggeration to say that no
town or city in Louisiana could
have given a more fitting reception
to the newspaper men. The peo
ple of the town, headed by the in
defatigable editor of the Chief, L.
E. Bentley, ably assisted by
Messrs. Kline, Vega, Simms and
others, had left nothing undone to
make the stay of their guests one of
pure pleasure, and how well they
succeeded need not be told. The
fair ones did their part so well that
we fear some of the bachelor mem
bers of the association will long
cherish some pleasant memories
of their visit to the historic town on
the Mississippi.
The Gazette will not give an ac
count of the meetings of the asso
ciation, the New Orleans papers
having alreadly published the entire
proceedings, We will only express
our thanks to the people of the
town for the splendid way in which
they received and entertained the
association. The visits to the pa
latial plantation homes of Hons.
Henry McCall and Jas. A. Ware
were a source of much pleasure to
all. The members of the associa
tion from the different parts of the
State were enabled to see the sugar
fields of Ascension and Iberville
parishes, thereby obtainring much
valuable information concerning the
cultivation of cane and its manufac
ture into sugar.
The reception at the home of Mr.
and Mrs. Bentley was a most bril
liant affair and will never he forgot
ten by the country editors, who,
for a time at least, were oblivious
of their troubles, and gallantly led
the fair daughters of Ascension,
keeping time to the music of the
dance with most exquisite grace.
The theatrical entertainment and
concert at the Opera House shows
that Donaldsonville possesses his
trionic and vocal talent of a high
order.
The editor of this paper returns
sincere thanks to Mr. an d Mrs.
Kline to whose home he had the
good fortune to be assigned by the
committee.
THE END OE PRIZE FIGHT
ING IN L 0 UISIAANA.
New Orleans States.
No decision in years has pleased the peo
ot this city and State more than that of the
Supreme Court yesterday which declared
that the glove contests given by the Olympic
and other alleged athletic clubs were in con
travention of the law prohibiting prize fight
ing in Louisiana. The decision, to the great
satisfaction of the community, will put an
end to the brutal pugilistic "carnivals," as
they are called, which have done so much
to disgrace New Orleans and to bring down
upon our people the sneers and the re
proaches of the whole country.
For the past three or four years the pr s
has protested earnestly and emluhaticaly
against these prize fights. because they were
degrading and demoralizing the youth of
our city, and cultivating in them the spirit
of tae hoodlumt and thug. Thanks, how
ever, to the Supreme Court New Orleans
will never again he advertised abroad as the
"'Mecca" of pugilists and the "Paradise" of
sports. and be overrun as it has been in the
past by the horde of murderers, thieves and
hoodlums who were attracted from all sec
tions of the country by the Sullivan-Csrbett
brutal, bloody and disgusting exhibitions
of slugging.

RECIPROCITY MIUST BE
PRA CTICED.
St. Martfnville Messenger.
An animated discussion occurred
in our presence a few days since
over the question that one will in
zvariably buy in the cheapest mar
ket, every article of household use
for the family. So far as it relates
to our home merchants, we say cor
rect. But when it is made a pre
text to buy away from home, we
emphatically say it is wrong, and
should not be done.
Why?
Because, primarily, it reduces
our money circulation, and, there
by, in its many ramifications, works
a loss to and injuriously effects sev
eral lines of bustness.
Let us illustrate: Suppose a dry
goods merchant, to save a few
cents, sends to Solari or some
other New Orleans merchant a $50
bill of groceries for the family use,
that is just that much taken away
from our local grocery men; with
that money the grocery men could
buy dry goods for their families,
and would, perhaps, buy from this
same merchant. So that in sending
that money away it goes out of home
hands, and is lost to local cirt:ula
tion Now the New Orleans mer
chant, does not spend a cent here
-he has no family, no clerk hire,
no rent, and benefits no one here.
On the other hand- our local
grocerymen, buy their dry goods
and other necessities from their
home merchants and keep that
money going from merchant to
merchant, and all get a slice of it;
and, in consequence, business is
moving right along.
Now, suppose, for family use, the
dry goods man should buy his gro
ceries in the city; the hardware man
should buy his dry goods in the
city; the druggist should buy his
groceries, dry goods, hardware, and
funiture in the city; the grocery
man should buy, also, all these
things in the city; and the general
buyer would go to the hardware
man to order his groceries from the
city, or, the grocery man would be
requeste l to order some dry goods
from Holmes' for his customers,
-s-il.l .?)t. 1 O, iS Qr e= .1 1 , ,.:-!:o r,: I!, h :::,
to the town, and its business, would
come in?
To keep our town in its present
prosperous state, as well as for its
further progress we must preach,
and above all, practice reciprocity
in our business relations.
