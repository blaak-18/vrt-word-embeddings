Y Thin hair is thickened, falling hair

Y ing can restore the hair where the
Sfollilehs are destroyed, or the glands
atrophied and decayed. But such as

by this application. Instead of foul

will keep it clean and vigorous. Its
Soccasional use will prevent the hair

consequently prevent baldness. Free
from those deleterious substances
rwhich make some prel)aratious d:m
