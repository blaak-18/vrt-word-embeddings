The concert given at the Firemen's
Hall on Wednesday evening last was not
as well attended as the performance mer
ited. Of course the exhibition is not a gi
gantio affair but what was done was well
done. The music was excellent, the sing -
ing, and particularly the "old log cabin
in the lane" in character, was particular
ly charming and the glees, jokes and
comedies, new and refreshing. The young
men propose giving another performance
thie (Satarday) evening, in which Mr.
Tom Laithan, the renowned banjoist will
positively appear in several of his
specialities, and we ask for them, what
they certainly merit, a full house. The
object is commendable and our people
will not regret the pleasant hour speat at

Brown, the murderer of Evans, who
was hung yesterday at Many, made a
confession to a VINDICATOR reporter just
before leaving our jail for the place of his
execution. He said: That Goodloe ask
ed him to assist in arresting Evans, and
conveying him from the Louisiana side to
the jail at Hemphill Texas. That he ac
companied Goodloe for that purpose, and
asethey were returning with Evans, Good
loe shot him (Evans) in the back, and he
(Brown) finished the job by killing him.
Brown is a young man 23 years of age,
and has from long confinement, become
pale and bloated. The story he told our
reporter is about what he has told others,
and he tried to impress the listener with I
the idea that he and Goodloe were justifi
able, because, "Evans quarreled" and
said he had a "right to marry as many i
women as he choee." All of this does no
eredit to Brown, and shows him the
young, hardened crlimnal and cold-blood. 1

Our Town and Parish.
Natchitochaes is a town of about 4000 inhabi
tantO, situatedl on Cane river, a stream navigable
tiring the winter season by the largest class of
steamboats, and withinj four miles of Red River,
which is navigable during the entire year. The
New Orleans Pacific Railroad, now in course of
construction. will pass within ten miles, South
n,ld West of us : efforts have been made to se
o:e a tap road whieh we are certain will be
effectedt. At present we are within 40 hoursn
run of New Orleans, per steatmer, and within lI
hours of Shrerveport, where raiiroad cornrlunlri
cation is open to all WVestern and Northern
markets.
Our town has three churches,. Catholic Epie
hopal and Methodist, (the latter in course of
constratinn;, attended by large and growing
congregations, while niutonrens churches of the
smaie denominations, and the Baptist, are scat

facilities as good as in any section. We have
three handsome school buildings. and numerous
private and public schools in the town, whilst
over 404) public schools were sustained during
the past year in the parish, through the public
school fund.
Public ednucation is attracting great streation,
ant during the one year which the niative citi
zen has had control of them it has IbeenI shown
that the importance of a good common school
edttestion is not to be overlooked. Some tron
ble has been had in securing the services of
cumpetent instructors but in a short titme all
difficulties now attending our public schools
will be overcomer
Natchitoches has over 40 stores and business
houses, blacksmanith shops, and wagon and cart
shops; while there is a great demand for mann
factories none have yet sprong up. A Foundry
would pay well there, as also would wagon antd
plow factories, cotton and wool mille, planing
machines. etc.
The town and parish are growing some in
population, and recuperating from the long role
of thte crrpet-bagger and $ignoraut negro; as in
f ct the Slate andi the whole South. The poput
lation of the parish is about 2(,000. while there
is ample room for ten times that onmber -not
mere than one-tenth of the areable land being in
cultivation. The soil'around this town is alu
vial and as rich as any in the world, while it is
inexhaustable. Farmers raise Cotton. Corn,
Oats, Sungar Cane. Rico (highland) Grasses, To

genial for the yield of grains of all kinds. As
a stock country this is unsurpassed. Our win

part of IDecember. and rarely continuing later
than the last of February. Much attentioa has
been given, within the last two years, to the irum
proving and rearing of cattle, horses, sheep and
hogs, and within a short time this section will

The Overshadowing question.
Congressional Action Must be Taken
-Hayes's Complicity in the Frauds.
From the Philadelpia Times.
The crime confessed by McLin and his
accomplices is the greatest political crime
known to the history of thits country, a
crime so heinous in itself and so far
reaclting in its effects that there is no
greater of its kind.
A Frand's Self-Complacency.
From the Utica Herald.
None of these things seriously trouble
Mr. Hayes. "'Now I am in, they can't
get me out," is one of the phrases Se na
tor Hamlin quotes frol the President,
as said, March 1877, with something of a
cneer. It expresses Mr. Hayes's position
toward both parties.
The Time has Come for Action.
From the Indianapolis Sentine).
The time has come for action. The
overthrow of these miscreante must in
augurate a new era in American politics.
Subserviency now meane submission to
the greater wrongs that will surely fol
low. Let the cry be raised, "Down with
the traitor."
Hayes Had Full Knowledge of the
Fraud.
From the Savaunah News.
These confessions show conclusively
that the treason of the Florida officials
against the Constitution and the rights
of the American people was but a part
ofa deliberate scheme of villainy con
cocted in Washington, and carried into
execution at the inmtigation and with
the full knowledge of Hayes.
Hayes is a Usurper.
From the New Orleans Democrat.
Mr. Hayes is a fraud; he holds his
oflice in violation of the Constitution
and the laws; he was placed in offlee by
a conspiracy which trampled upon the
legally~expressed will of the people; he
is a nusrper, pure and simple. It is
strange language, therefore, Democrats,
or, for that matter, American citizens of
any political party, use when they speak
of the policy of acquiescing in his ueur
pation.
Hayes will Dodge the Issue.
From the Baltimore Sun,
The personal friends of Mr. Hayes will
direct their efforts in case of investiga
tion to enlarge iho scope, so as to in
clude various collateral questions, the
purpose being to protract the investiga- 1
tion that it may be made practically
useless. The anti-Administration Re
publicans will doubtless find it to their
Interest to assist in this plan of tactics.
New Jersey on the Fraud.
From the Morris County Chronicle.
That true Democrat, John R. McPer- a
son of New Jersey, who is solitary and i
alone of the Senators openly in favor of
the Blair bill, says:
"I do not believe in condoning fraud,
whaturer it may cost the country to blot
out the most infamous record of our his
tory. I would1 favor any measure that I
would proppee to unearth the greatest I
political crime in the annals of the is- i
tion." '
TIHE BOY SUICIDE.
Tired of Life While Yet on the Thresh.
hold.
As Stoical as an Indian.
A sad and terrible occurrence took
place at St. Maunice, on Friday, April
26th. I was summoned to attend a lad
(Ramnie Duprey) 13 years of age, nephew
of Alcide Helbert, who had deliberately
;hot himself with the intent to colummit
muicide; of course, 1 was impressedl that
had Ireatinen'. inhuman treatment, alone
culdl drive one of so tender years thus
to take his life'. I found the boy upon a
blanket in tinr tent of a traveling Artist.
with a pistol wound inmmediately above
the crest of rhe right itlism, (hip hone)
the ball ranging square across t'he ab
ldomen andul lodging just below the stom
ach. He was rational; suntfring no pain,
a little pale and self-possessed; the pis
tol used was a Remmiugton double bar
rel. Nickle plated, carrying quite a large
hIll. After administering a dose of mor
phine and applying wet cloths to the
wonud, I deemed it my duty to inquire
into the true cause for his commnitting
such a deed. I approached him kindly;
my son, what has indluced you to do
this? have you been abused, ill treated
to such an extent that you were driven
to this i His answer was "'No, they make
me mad." Waiting a moment for hin
to reflect, I repeated the question, guard
ing hint to tell me the whole truth. he
answered as before. "No, they make me
mad." Do you know this is a terrible act
for a man, much less a boy t He made no
answer. I was then introduced to his
Uncle, who was shedding bitter tears,
and he assured me no ill treatment had
brought it about; as did another mem
ber of the famuilly, that nothing of the
kind had occurred. It appears some
words had passed between the boy and
his Aunt, and. he told her that belore
three days, hlie would he dead. Why
Ramie, are you not ashamed to talk in
that way --"You'll see." He took a skiff
belonging to a neighbor, and boldly
pushed out into Red River from the Mc
Tyre place, where his Uncle keeps a
store, and pulled up at St. Maurice, some
15 miles below. Being absent, his Uncle
he an to search for hlinm, and found he
had taken the skiff', and so followed on
down the river inquiring for him; when
bhe came to the bank of the Saline Bayou
he saw the lad, and before hlie could cross
over, the boy went into the tent took
up the pistol, looked around and put it
to his side and fired, the Artist was out
of the tent at the time, some distance
off, but saw him when he fell, hlie stood
bent for a moment or two, then stagger
ed and fell. His mother is a widow and
requested her brother to take this boy
and control and try to make a man of
him, to punish him if necessary; he had
lived 3 years with his Uncle, and his
mother could not control him. Ilearn
that lie had tried to obtain strychnine
befliore coming to St. Maurice.
Hlie manifested no concern abount his
conditio , was as stoical and indifferent
as an Indian. He said to his Aunt, "I
will die by night," this he said the morn
ing of the 27th, and at 12 o'clock that
day hlie died.
This statement is made by me simply
in justice to the family as they are rela.

MEMORIAL DAY IN MACON.
Ex.President Davis' Letter on the Con
federate Dead.
[Macon Telegraph.]
Col. S. P. Fort introduced Mr. J.
L. Saulebury, Jr., the gentleman se
lected to lend tihe letter of ex-Pres
ident Jefferson Davis. Mr. Saulabury
rose and in an eloquent manner read
one of the grandest letters ever pen
ned by human hand. The selection
of the reader was peculiarly felicitous.
In a voice modulated to great perfec
tion and in a manner which showed
how deeply the reader felt the een ti
ments of glowing patriotism of the
great ex-President of the Confedera
cy, Mr. S. executed the trust assigned.
The letter was read as follows:
LETTER FROM PRESIDENT JEFF. DAVIS.
MIssrslzPrl CITY, Miss., April 11, 1878
Gentllmena:-I sincerely regret my
inability to be present at the laying
of the corner-stone of "a monu
ment to be erected at Macon, Ga., in
honor of our dead Confederates sol
diers."
The event possesses ever'y attrac
tion to me; it is inspired by the La
dies' Mlemnorial Association; the mon
ument is to be located in the Key
stone State of the Confederate arch,
and to commemorate the sacrifices of
those whio died in the defense of our
inherited and "inalienable" rights.
What though we were overborne
by numbers, and accessories not less
etficient, truth is not to be measured
by success in maintaining it against
force; nor is the glory less of him
who upholds it in the face of onequal
odds, but is it not more to his credit
that he counted all else as dust in the
balance when weighed with honor
and duty ! On many a stricken feld
our soldiers stood few and faint, but
fearless still, for they wore the pan
OPY of noquestioning confdeoce in
the rectitudle of their cause, and
knew how to die but not to surrender.
Let not any of their survivors impugn
their faith by offering the penitential
plea that "they believed they were
right."
Be it ours to transmit to posterity
our unequivocal testimony to the
justice of their convictions, to their
virtues, and the sanctity of the mo
tives by which they were actuated.
It is meet that this monument
should have originated with the la
dies of the land, whose self-denial
was conspicuous through all the tri
als and sufferings of war, whose gen
tle ministrations in hospitals and at
wayside refectories so largely contrib
uted to relieve the sick and wounded,
and whose unofaltering devotion to
their country's cause in the darkest
hours of our struggle illustrated the
fidelity of the sex which was last at
the cross and frst at the eepolchre.
I am profoundly thankful to them
for inviting me to represent them,
as their orator, on the approaching
occasion. Had it been practicable to
accept, their request would have been
to me a command, obeyed with no
other reluctance than the conscious
ness of loability to do justice to the
theme.
Thanks to the merits of our Con
federate dead, they need neither ora
tor nor bard to commend their deeds
to the present generation of their
countrymen. Many fell far from
home and kindred, and sleep in on
marked graves; but all are gathered
in the love of those for whom they
died, and their memories are hallow
ed in the hearts of all irue Confed
rates.
By the pious efforts of our people,
many humble cemeterielL such, as,
in their impoverishment, tore posei
ble, have been prepared, and the Con
federate dead have been collected
in them from neighboring battlefields.
There annually, with reveratial af.
fection, the grave, alike of the known
and the rnkiou n, are decked with
ve'n:dl flowers, ex plessive of grati
rude renew, ble forever, and typical
of the hope of a resurrection and re
union where the wicked cease from
troubling and the weary are at rest.
To be remembered, honored, belov
ed iby their people in the rewardnt be
stowed on our Confederate dead. It
is the highest which a good and pare
ly patriotic man could desire. Should
it be asked, why then huilil this mon
ument I the answer is, they do not
need it, but prosterity may. It is not
their reward, but our debt. If the
greatest gift a hero gives his race is
to have been a heiro, in order that
this gift may he utilized to coming
generations its apprecialtion by con
temporaries should be rendered as
visible andr enduring as possible. Let
the moniiument rising from earth to
ward heaven, lift the minds of those
who) come after us to a hrigher stand
ard than the common test of success.
Let it teach that man is born for
duty, not for expediency ; that when
an attack is made on the community
to which lie belongs, by which lie is
protected, and to whliich his allegiance
is due, his first obligation is to de
fend that community ; and that under
such conditions it is better to have
"fought and lost, than never to have
fought at all." Let posterity learn
by this monument that you comme
rmorate meni who fought in a defen
sire war; that they did not, as has
been idly stated, submit to the ar
bitiament of arms the question at is
sue-questions which involved the
inalienable rights inherited from their
posterity ; but that they strove to
maintairn the State sovereignty which
their fathers left them, and which
it was their duty, if possible, to trans
mit to their clhildren.
Away then with such feeble excuse
for the abandonment of principles,
which may te crushed for a while,
but which, possessing the eternal vi
tality of truth, must in its own good
timne prevail over perishable error.
Let this monument tenach that he
roism derives its lustre from the jus
tice of the cause in which it is dis
played, and let it mark tire difference
between a war waged for the robber
like purpose of conquest and one to
repel invasion-to defend a people's
hearths, and altars, and to maintain
their laws and liberties. Such was
the war in which our heroes fell, nod
theirs is the crown which sparkles
with the gems of patriotism and right
eousness, with a glory undimmed by
any motive of aggrandisement or in
tent to inflict ruin on others. We
present them to posterity as examples
to be followed, and when knowledge
shall have dispelled misrepresenta
tion and delusion. It is unreason
able to hope that mature reflection
and a closer study of a political his
tory of the Union may yet restore the
rights prostrated by the passions de
veloped in our long and bloody war I
If however, it should be othet wise,
then from our heroes' graves shall
come in mournful tones the
"Answer fit:
And if our children must obey,
They must, but thinking on our day,
'Twill less debase them to asubmit."
Yours, faithfully,
JEFFERSON DAVIS.
Daring the reading, almost at each
sentence would fall, the applause of
the assembled multitude would rise
upon the air.
Never will those who heard it for
get this letter. But stored away in
the treasury of memory it will remain
a diamond never to tarnish, sealed
with the signet of immortality. The
reader, too, who so eloquently gave
otterance to the words of the absent
patriot will not be forgotten by those
for whom he once offiered his life as a
sacrifice.

The Railroad Decision.
Pluck Wins.
[Shreveport Times.]
Editor Shreveport Times:
The supreme court through Chief
Justice Manning rendered decision in
the case of the State of Louisiana ex
rel. New Orleans Pacific railroad com
pany vs. F. T. Nicholls Governor, and
others, reversing the decision of the
lower court and ordering mandamus
mdae peremptory, and two millions in
bonds to be signed and delivered to
relator.
Thus, by indomnitable perseverence
and pluck, E. B. Wheelock has
brought this grand home enterprise to
the high road of soccess. The re
joicing is great over the action of the
supreme court. G. W. DUPREE.
New Orleans May 6.-The Supreme
Court decided the great bond case in
favor of the New Orleans Pacific rail.
road. It declared the two million is
sue to be legal and ordered the Audi.
tor to issue $250,000 immediately in
compliance with the conditions.
When all the present valid debt is
funded, including 3506,551 of consoli
dated planters' asscemated bonds, the
debt will be only $12,089,128, leaving
more than enough loom for tIle two
million dollars for thb railroad before
the limit of fiften million dollars is
reached.

Election Riot.
New York, May 6.-Special from
Weldon Noith Carolina, says the elec
tion of county commissioners was the
occasion of a serious riot here this
morning between whites and negroes.
Both races had candidates in the field
and great excitement prevailed.
About 10 o'clock a riot began and
clubs, knives and pistols were freely
used. Quite a number of persons
were shot, cut and bruised. One man
a negro, will die, it is thought of iDja
ries and several others are regamuod
dangerous. A military company has
been telegraphed for to Norfolk, as
indicitions of a fresh outbreak are inl
minent. The presencefof the Virgi
nia military on the other side of the
river may have a quieting effect.
The Radieat Jrogrammie.
[Morehouse Clarion.
From what we can gather fiom oar
State exchanges, the Radical pro
grammoe in the next campaign will be
about as follows: No State organ
ization will be effected, but in the
strong Republican parishes full paro
chial tickets will be nominated. In
the Democratic parishes no contess
will be made. In those parishes,
however, which are considered any
ways doubtful, they will place in the
feld what they are pleased to call
"independent" tickets, which will be
composed mainly of old, broken down
Radical politicians, with a good man
mixed isl now and then to give it res
pectability. The candidates for Be
presentatives on these tickets are in
every case to be Radicals of tihe deep
eat dye, and they thus hope to elect
enough strait-out Republicans and
so-called independents to give them
control of the lower branch ofthe
General Assembly.
