the trusts? Could I prove by their
platform that they are held together
for the purpose of enacting legisla
tion which will enrich the few at the
expense of the many? Could I prove
from their platforms that whenever
the Republican party in Congress
can not swing their representatives
solidly in favor of class laws, they
can go to the Democratic party and
get the necessary votes to carry out
their damnable program? You
know I couldn’t, and yet see what
serfs of plutocracy both these old
parties are! Socialism can not be
judged by a platform framed by a
few American leaders who desire to
hoodwink and to trick the people in
to believing that Socialism is not as
bad as it is.
When the Populist party was on
deck, it was easy to tell what it stood
for by examining its platform, for
the reason that it did not contend
that our whole system should be de
stroyed, and a new one built, but
simply pointed out what was wrong,
and what ought to be remedied. So
cialism is revolution: it proposes to
supplant the existing order with an
other one. Consequently, in study
ing what Socialism is, you must go
about it as you would study what
Christianity is, or what Buddhism is.
It is a cult; a new science; a new
order of things entirely, and, just as
I would go to Darwin’s books to tell
what Darwinism is; just as I would
go to books written by the founders
-of Christian Science to tell what
Christian is, so I have honestly and
industriously sought the meaning of
Socialism in the books which were
written and published by those who
founded it.
If Debs, Warren, Wayland, Victor
Berger, Joseph Medill Patterson and
Richard LeGalliene were not afraid,
they would meet the challenge which
I have flung in their faces,, month
after month, on the back cover of my
Magazine, daring them to prepare,
sign and publish a declaration show
ing what Socialism means as to the
marriage relation, private ownership
of land, racial and social equality,
and the home. Why couldn’t they
do that, if they haven’t got some
thing they mean to hide? Why
shouldn’t they frankly publish to the
world a statement on those subjects?
I will tell you why, they don’t dare
to do it. It is because they are
preaching one gospel in Europe and
in the American cities, while they
are publishing an entirely different
doctrine, in the rural communities of
our country. If they were to sign
and publish a statement to the ef
fect that Socialism is w T hat yon think
it is, they would lose their millions
of fanatical followers, (mostly com
posed of ignorant, lawless, immi
grants) in the big cities. You could
not, for a million dollars, get Eugene
Debs, and those other leaders of So
cialism, to face an audience in New
York or Chicago, and declare that
Socialism is what you think it is.
On the other hand, if they were to
sign and publish a statement to the
effect that Socialism is what its
founders and its chief apostles, said,
and continue to say, that it is, Social
ism would lose at once such mis
guided men as yourself.
Very truly yours,
THOS. E. WATSON.

AN APPRECIATION FROM JUDGE
TWIGGS.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson:—Your ar
ticle in the February number of your
Magazine, entitled, “A Gross Insult
to the Scotch,” is a masterpiece. It
is one of the most powerful articles
you ever wrote-—besides it is a gem,
sparkling with wit and eloquence. . It
should be hung in every Southern
man’s house in a frame of gold.
Bravo, Tom! I hope you sent the
old Scotch fraud and brute a marked
copy for his edification.
Sincerely yours,
H. D. D. TWIGGS.
Savannah, Ga.
ENDORSES BROTHER DUNBAR’S
STAND#*
Rev. William Dunbar, Atlanta, Ga.
Dear Brother: —In The Jefferson
ian of Decmber 23d, I saw a letter
from you to Watson, and his com
ment on game,
I want to say, as a brother in the
M. E. Chruch (byway of encourage
ment), that I admire any man that
has the backbone to stand by what
he believes to be right, especially a
preacher in the church I belong to.
Like you, I’m a believer in Tom
Watson, and that he is the man that
standi for the right as he sees it. He
will meet any one honestly.
May God keep you, and may you
always stand for the right, as you
have in the past. May you live to see
many good years yet to fight for the
right.
Yours for the right,
J. P. MAYOR.
McLean, Texas.
A WOMAN WHO SEES HER DUTY
AT HOME.
Dear Sir:—Enclosed please find
$2.00 for the renewal of my sub
scription to both the Jeffersonians.
* You may send them and the premium
knives to the same address, N. M.
Hollingsworth, Terry, Miss., Route 1,
though the dear one who bore the
name has passed over the river and
is now at rest. I feel that I am do
ing honor to his memory by taking
the Jeffersonians in his name. He
was a subscriber to every one of
your publications, from first to last,
and worked for reform, attended al
most every reform convention, and
voted for you a§d reform.
To say that he was a great ad
mirer of yourself is but to express
it mildly. He busied himself as long
as he lived to extend the circulation
of each of your periodicals, from the
People’s Party paper to the Jeffer
sonians, and was a firm believer in
the immortal principles advocated by
you in your valuable publications.
From first to last he has sent you
dozens of subscriptions, but would
never accept an agency or receive
any remuneration for his services,
but sent all at his own expense, for
his love of Yight and the cause for
which you are laboring. As long as
he lived, we both read your papers,
and in my lonely widowhood I still
read every word of them and anxi
ously look forward for the mail that
brings them.
How any man or woman, who
prizes valuable facts and informa
tion, instructive lessons well arranged
and ready for digestion, can do with
out the Jeffersonians is more than I
can understand. I would part from
any publication that comes into my
family (fifteen come) before I would
give up the Jeffersonians. I am not
blessed with a surplus of this world’s
goods, and I have two more children
to put through college (I have put
four through), but I will eat and
wear less, and cling to the Jeffs.
I am with you on the Foreign Mis
sion question. Like yourself, I am
a believer in, and a supporter of,
missions according to the scriptural
plan. I have been president of a
missionary society for fourteen years,
but have never believed in, or work
ed for, the building of schools in for
eign countries as a part of our mis
sionary work. I have always advo
cated “sweeping before our own
doors” before undertaking to clean
up the premises of others.
I have passed the sixty-second
Jeffersonian
milestone along life’s pathway, and
in all these years, excepting my first
eight, I have been in and connected
with schools, either as pupil or teach
er, and what has stirred my soul
most was to see so many deserving
girls and boys without the adequate
means of acquiring an education. Oh,
how I longed in my girlhood, how
willingly I would have toiled,, and
did toil, for the opportunities that
are now GIVEN to the Jap and Chi
nese girls by our missionary work
ers! But the opportunity was not
afforded me, and it was not until
after I was married, and began to
feel the responsibilities of a family,
that I had the chance, —and I em
braced it—of acquiring a college
education, and I have made it a part
of my life work to help, to encour
age and to point upward those who
are thirsting for that which was de
nied me in my girlhood. I am still
teaching, and have-lately taken into
hiy home and am instructing one
who has aspirations but has small
hope that those aspirations could
ever be realized in her own home;
and I feel that I am doing God’s will
more in helping this little sixteen
year-old Baptist white girl than in
sending the same amount abroad to
the yellow or black girls.
I know I am writing too much, but
I can not close without thanking you
for the lucid explanation of the Ship
Subsidy, as well as for the manner of
so clearly handling the many other
subjects, making them so plain that
there is no necessity of research on
my part, but, above all, for the R. F.
D. that you fought for and gained
for us,
I promise to return the favor in
part by furnishing—should you ever
need them—five votes, four from my
own noble, intelligent sons, and one
from my loved son-in-law, law stu
dent, linguist and literateur—votes
of which any man may be proud on
account of the personnel of those
who, I hope, may some day have the
chance to cast them for you.
Very truly and respectfully,
(Mrs.) M. E. HOLLINGSWORTH.
Terry, Miss.
WANTS TO SUPPRESS THE JEF
FERSONIANS!
Deal' Brother:—ln the absence of
the pastor at the Baptist church in
Bremen, a Saturday or two ago, Bro.
John Quincey Riggs rose and took
your position on “Foreign Missions”
as his text, and what he said almost
1 roze my blood—he was so earnest
and eloquent (.?). Surely, your ears,
on that particular Saturday, must
have burned—if so, you know now’
the cause, because one of z your Bap
tist brethren was unlimbering on you.
He actually said that'your papers
should be suppressed and not allow’ed
the use of Uncle Sam’s mails. Horri
ble! Horrible! And that, too, when

AN ATLANTA STENOGRAPHER’S
TRIBUTE.
Honored Sir:—l believe it my
duty to enclose you the slip you will
find attached. It was taken from the
Dallas Laborer of January 1, 1910,
and as it does a great injustice to a
noble character; and as it hurt me
when I read it, and as I thought it
might deceive some poor w’orking
man that believed in you, as I do,
who w'orks for his living ten hours
of each day as a stenographer, and
take these few moments to address
you and express the love and confi
dence I. have in you. If people do
not see' you as a great man now,
some day they will.

cialist paragraph.)
