In addition to its enterprise as a news.e

The public journal mostly deserving of
Democratl s5uPlmEt is the one that, in
additiou to being a full and faithful bend
consistent advocate of Democratic prin
uiiles. A Democratic newspaper is the
newspaper for Democrate to support, and
the idea sometimes sought to be imculewa
a! by those who have an interest of their
ewa in doing so that the people must go
sateide theimir party organ to "find the

WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
, Clampion "American Comic Paper !
t Illnstrated by a corps of the.best A meri
can artists, and contributed to by the
nmost popular humorists and satirists of
t the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfully up
t on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the established humorous and
t satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as a
t monthly, then, to satisfy the demand of
the public, it was changed to a fortnight
t ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
t the political and social shams by its
masterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater success than
before, and was recognized as the, ablest
and brightest of itsclass. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
Smng the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnis! illustrations for Wild Oats are
t Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth. Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels
t Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, aud several
others who are yet known to fame.
t In its literary departments Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one firs-eclass
serial story will always be found in its
Spanges, by the best humorous, satirical.
I and character writers in the United
S States; while its sketches and squibs
f will be sparkling, original and pointed.
t Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be
t taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fas
t tidions.

n Dr. J. WalkerE's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
1 etable preparation, made chiefly from
* the native herbs found on the lower
t ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
t talus of California, the medicinal
~- properties of which are extraeted
h therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
s, The question is almost daily asked,
s " What is the cause of the unpar
z alleled success of VINEGAR BIT
', rns t" Our answer is, that they
e remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
Is vatoe' and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos.
e sessing the remarkable qualities of Vis
a soAR BITTERS in healing the sick of
- every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
P- relieving Congestion or Inflammatibn of

bly so during seasons of unusual
t heat and dryness, are invariably ac
n companied by extensive derange
s ments of the stomach and liver, and
r other abdominal viscera. In their
- treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
t ous organs. is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to DR. J.'WALKER'S VIXEuGAR
BIrrsas,. as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
1 stimulating the secretions of the liver.
and generally restoring the healthy func

Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
whenever you tind its impurities bursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,

strucneted and sluggish in the veins; cleanse
it when it is foul your feelings will tell
Syou when. Keep the blood pure, and the
