“TURN ON THE EIGHT.”
Esteemed Friend:—With pleas
ure and intense interest I am read
ing your articles in the Jeffersonians
on the great subject of “Foreign
Missions.” It is surprising to me
that any intelligent person,—espe-
cially one who is truly American in
principle—could find any fault in
your investigations of this very im
portant subject, unless it is one who,
like the Catholic priest, desires to
keep the common masses in ignor
ance in order that they may feast
themselves at the expense of the peo
ple.
Again, it is strange that any honest
person could find fault, when you
introduce (only) witnesses who pro
fess to be advocates of the mission
work. If your articles are untrue,
then who is at fault?
Now as your paper seems to be the
only medium open for the “airing”
of this great question, to-wit, mis
sions, I just want to ask a few ques
tions. These questions are open for
anybody, and I hope that through
the columns of your esteemed paper
answers may be given.
First. What is the difference be
tween the spirit that prompts foreign
missions by the Protestants and the
spirit of Catholicism? Now don’t
get mad, like the Rev. Mr. Scoville,
but just give us plain, respectable
answers. Let us remember that this
is no personal issue, we want light.
That’s all. Our missionaries (irre
spective of name) tell us that it is
through the efforts of the preacher
that heathen are saved. Don’t
Catholics claim the same for their
priests? Are they not entitled to
claim as much merit for their priests
as Protestants do for their preach
ers? If not, why not? Did the
Lord endow Protestants with saving
power and withhold it from Catho
lics? If so, please give book, chap
ter and verse.
Mr. Watson has said in one of his
articles that in heathen lands “That
the contention becomes so great be
tween Protestant missionaries and
catholic missionaries that the mili
tia has to be called into service.”
Yet, and still, both Protestants and
Catholics claiming to be the disci
ples of Jesus. Shame! Tell me, is
it not a spirit of rivalry and pride
that’s moving the great mission
wheel? As proof to support foreign
missions they quote, “Go ye into all
the world and preach the gospel to
every creature. He that believeth
and is baptized shall be saved.”
Mark 16:15-16. According to the
theory as preached by the advocates
of the mission system, the above text
contains two essential conditions, be
lief and baptism. Now, in the event
one believes and dies without bap
tism, what about their salvation?
Seeing that one essential (baptism)
is lacking. Again, if the claims of
our Baptist missionaries be correct
(that immersion only is baptism),
what about the thousands who pro
fess to believe and are still without
baptism? Let us remember that, ac
cording to the theory, belief and bap-
tism are essential conditions that
merit salvation. Then it naturally
follows that in the absence of bap
tism, salvation is not secured, be
cause baptism is just as essential as
belief, and, as a condition, merits just
as much. Again, the advocates of
the mission theory tell us that the
Lord wants our money and assist
ance in sending the gospel to all the
world. Isn’t it strange that a God
who is able to create a world, and
people it according to his own choice,
would then suffer a desire just be
cause man is not willing? Is it not
strange that prior to 1792 that his
desire to send the gospel (by man
and money) into all the world was
not discovered?
Finally, does man carry the gos
pel, or does the gospel carry the
man?
Turn on the “Light.”
Yours sincerely,
A. L. RAY.

A TRIBUTE SINCERELY APPRE
CIATED.
Dear Sir: —I have just read an
extract, quoted from your “Water
loo,” in the Charlotte Observer of
today, and I confess I did not know
you had a book with that title. I
have worn out one copy of the “Story
of France,” which, in my opinion, is
the greatest contribution to history
made by any American. Your “Na
poleon” I have read half a dozen
times. No book on this great man
pleases me so much, and I have read
more than a thousand about him.
Your “Jefferson” is more than good
—it is great and good. Now, I want
your “Waterloo.” Will you kindly
write me where I can procure a copy?
While in Philadelphia some time
since I was at a dinner party at the
home of Hon. Chas. F. Wornick, ex
mayor, and author of “Robespierre,”
“Danton,” and “Mirabeau,” and the
remarked that your “Napoleon” was
the most satisfying book he had
ever read on the subject.
1 am an ex-school man who retired
from that work because of a nervous
break-down. I now devote my
spare moments to the Revolutionary
Period of French history, and have
collected quite a number of books,
points, etc., on the subject. I wish
your busy life might be devoted ex
clusively to writing. I do not know
how many distinguished men I have
heard make the same statement.
I trust you will not think me pre
sumptuous for having said so much.
When I began this letter I only in
tended to write you for the informa
tion.
Thanking you in advance, I am,
Sincerely,
DRED PEACOCK.
High Point, N. C., Aug. 23, 1909.
(Note: Mr. Peacock and “the
many distinguished men” evidently
do not know that my “busy life is
devoted to writing.” They have
never heard of the two Jefferson
ians, the Andrew Jackson serial, the
volume on Southern Oratory, the
Handbook, and a few other books
and things.—T. E. W.)
“WHO IS REV. J. R. LAMB?” OR
“WHAT IS THE ORDER OF
TRUE AMERICANS?”
We the undersigned, deacons of
the First Baptist church at Aragon,
"Jeffersonian
Ga., do hereby certify that Rev. J.
R. Lamb came to our town in March,
1908, well recommended by the Bap
tist church at Trenton, Ala., where
he had been pastor during the last
ten years preceding his move to this
place. He is now our pastor, and
his conduct since he has been among
us has been that of a Christian gen
tleman in every respect. Bro. Lamb
is a very plain, but scholarly minis
ter, and an able writer.
He is also president of the General
Order of True Americans, and we
regard him as fully competent for
this important position in every re
spect. He has organized a local
lodge of this order here in our town,
and its members are all good citi
zens, and the order has not caused
the slightest disturbance in any way.
We hope to see such great men as the
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, and others,
in the leade ship of this young but
promising order with Bro. Lamb.

WHAT THE FIRELESS COOKER
REALLY IS.
By an Expert Cook.
If all housekeepers thoroughly un
derstood the merits of the fireless
cooker, they would no more be with
out one than they would without a
sewing machine or a cooking stove.
Some one has said that they should
not have been called fireless cooker,
as the name is calculated to inspire
mistrust. Heat retainer would have
been a better appellation, as the
principle upon which they cook is the
retaining of the heat by perfect in
sulation after the food has been
brought to the boiling point on the
stove, or, as in the case of the roast
ing attachment, the heat is furnished
by the use of two hot radiators, one
of which is placed under the pail and
the other on the rack inside the pail.
By the use of the ftreless cooker
the housekeeper can start her meat,
vegetables, soup, etc., to boiling on
the coal or flame stove while she is
preparing breakfast and transfer
them, still boiling, to the cooker to
be finished. It is now generally ad
mitted to be the most perfect and
healthful way of cooking meats, ce
reals and all articles of food which
require long, slow heat, and its pos
sibilities in the way of pot pies,
stews, puddings, etc., are almost in
numerable.
It not only saves fuel, time and
labor, but by rendering cheap cuts of
meat palatable and nutritious it will
also be found an actual saving in
meat bills and in many other ways.
Imagine on a hot day having the din
ner all packed away in the fireless
cooker, the kitchen cool and straight
and the busy housewife with the
much coveted time for sewing or
reading. Yet this is no fairy tale,
but the actual conditions which ex
ist in the progressive kitchen where
the tireless cooker is used. No run
ning back and forth to keep up fires,
no ashes nor dirt, no smoked uten
sils to wash; the tireless cooker
works the same night and day and
does its work more perfectly than an
ordinary stove.
For 25 cents we will send you The
Jeffersonian for 3 months and a piece
of music worth 25 cents in any music
store.
