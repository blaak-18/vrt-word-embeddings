h ow l'º Make a Well.
Mr. J. W. lFilkhaill, has al paper on
'Wi 'ls and Ciseencs" in Sct ihner's
Monthlly for Septlhm'lber, from "thich
we ex tact the follow ing:
First, of conu csi, te well tluist be
so constrllcted that it ca iniot l"t as it

this part of the raill .,'gthill,.1. The
first can be acco,;iut Ilii-d by having
the wall froms a p,,int twoi or three
feet f'rom the bottim ttadte of brick
with a coating of hI diaalie cemnent
on its exteritt, ,1 of hydraulic well
tubing tith the joinin gs well pro
tecti wfith c.'.nett ; in either case
the earth should be thoroughly pack
ed amound the wall, and a slight enm
liankment should lie made around the
orifice to prevent the iu- low of sus -
face or storm water.
uI such ai well the draining sur
face is so ri dileed, and placed at such
a distance below the surftiaco of the
grountld, that iii the great majority of
ilstances the introduction of forcig.
matter becotues imtnossiile, exc'ept in
so far as theire is a chance that sub
stances o ill fll into thle well from
above. To prevetnt this the well
should be kept covered whlen tiot itt
use. In miost cases, however, it is
better to orit the uhpper part otf the
wall iltogether. After the ex'cava
tion is completed, the wall caui be
hbuilt i n the usual iatiier fur a dis
tance of two oi three feet, more or
less, as citttitislanaces may deanito;
the service pipe can then be placed
in position, and the well arched over.
The lentaitider tf the excavation ca,
then be filled with earth, well packed

several layets of stones successively

Thle workmien will probably stig

There is a plrevalent notion tihat a
tell should be ventilated for the Iur
,,ose oef allowing noxious gases to
escape; and that water is better for
heintg exposed to tohe aiir. I hardly
need state that the only noxious gas
ias in a well (i. e., gases which render
the wat r anwholesonie), are the pro
ducts of lue decomposition of orguanic
niattter which has founid its way itito
the well it ways which have beenl
described above, and that water, as
it flows in its subterranean passage,
is mlore perfectly terated than it can
be in any other way.
PreTentlon of Vermin.
I give below my receipt and treat
ment for young chicks, by which I
hrAe always been successfual in keep
ing tlemn free from vermin and
gapes: "Tamkj fouir ounces of lard
ind melt in an earthen vessel ; add to
this half a teaspioonful of counton
carbolic acid, stirring well until cold.
When a brood is ready to leave the
test I grease the lieu with this mix
ture, under the wings, between the
li~ghs, and around the vent; also,
with the finger, rub a small portion
in the toip of the htead, and along the
throat of the chicks, being careful
flat none gets in the eyes. Carbolic
acitt mixed with air slacked lime
timkes a splendid powder for dusting
the soot fnd crevices of the hen
mouse, desttoying vermin atid all nox
ious odors, anti adds much to the
wholesomeness of the al)artmenets.
For scaly-leg 1 use the following:
lHalf pint each ot colntnon fish oil
and kerosene oil; one-half an ounce
of sulphur with a small qautity of
catholic acid, mixed together. Ap
ply with'a smalt brush such as paint

allowing two days to intervens be.

A Xeatey for Bed Bugs.
A correspondent writes' tin the
British Medical Journal as follows:
"The best remedy for bugs in hospi.
Jals is & ldg-trap made by boring a
setleS of holes in & piece of wood
with a ghmlet, and placing this under
(he mlttrass of eafti' cot. The piece
of wood is to be pliced perioditally
iunt a basiu of boiliig water. This
it an lndian hospital plan."
