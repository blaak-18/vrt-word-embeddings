One starry night, in fiecker'd shad,
Of rose bush and of viine,
The fierce Grinialkin, crouching "laid"
Wit h head and tail in hIc
'Adowun his back, dim grizzl'd hair, 'i.
His brindle length did trace ;
Whilst eyes of i:ie, with steady glare,
Lit up his iottled l'ace.
No thought of love, or chase, or rest,
Possessessed rinialkiu's mind,
lBut Anger tossed his pided breast,
And twirl'd his tail behind.
Young Tholmas of a neighb'riug lot,
Weill grown and full of life,
Was wont to seek this fated spot,
And challcuege him o strife.
Long taunted, now Grimallkin's wrath
liad kindled into flaue ;
Thus crouched Ire on the very path,
Where Thomas nightly canic.
lhBtimes, lithe Thomas did appear,
All-spry, and dingy white,
(tlick cast he oil his foe a leer,
Then squatted for the light.
Grimualkin growl'd, bat steady kept,
His-well-alipouiated place ;
Whilst loot uy tiout, young T'honias crept,
'Til they were face to lace.
Then came a burst of startling crieb,
That, fairly rut thu air;
Whilst hair and tails alternate rise,
beneath each other's stare.
A moment mory, and tooth and nail
Were bared in horrid seen ;
lioth gave a liual twirl of tail,
Anas then they buckled in.
Now clinch'd, a spotted ball, they seeml'd
To roll through mists of hair ;
Whilst each the louder, shriller, screamn'd,
At each successive tear.
Yea ! but for oscillating tails,
That now in circles sluu ;
'Twere hard to tell, but that these males
Were welded into one.
At length, there caine a piteous wail,
'That told the work was doun ;
Young Thonmas, riplp'd from head to tail,
Hladt made its lie run.
'Twas over, but the ground and gtass
Disclosed th fat, full wull,
That lierce Grimulkin did, alas!
Give ploor young Thomias hell.
Be True to Yourselves.
Last week we published an iterest
ing eomniunication from Mr. Todd, a
planter in St. Mlary's parish, to the
|Irashcar Aeiws in which he says he
will not employ next year, any man
black or n bite, on his plantation,
who does vote to retain in office men
who are either incompetent or dis
hoznest.
We feel that Mr. Todd has solved
the great problem that has so long
agitated the public mind, viz : "how
to redeem the State from the rule of
ignorance, duplicity and dishonesty ;"
and we feel that it only lacks united
action upon the part of plautert, mner
chants, boss mechanics and the good
people generally to make-this plan a
successful one, even to the uniting la
bor and capital hereafter upon the
solid basis of co-operation against po
litical ignorance, umewdicacy and thiev
ery. There can be no doubt of this
if the taxpaying people will but re
main true to themselves and the true
interests of their State.
This suggestion by Mr. Todd has
naturally brought down upon his head
the great radical weapon, not unlike,
in its substance, a certain Chinese im
plement of war, butt such warfare is
suggestive of the true character of the
mighty warirors against whom we
have long and persistently battled.
It is their jugglery we wish to defeat,
and so long as we permit themn to play
their own favorite game so long will
they be able to find the aces to defeat
us with. Therefore, it it proposed to
change from this game of chance to
a solid and honest plan whereby he
who plays fair and does not pollute
the cause he espouses shall be the
winning man.
But this is not their forte ; so averse
are the thieves and demagogues to an
honest deal and an honest game, that,
like John Chinaman, they bounce, up
as if stung to the bone, cry out their
threats of blood and devastation,
brandishing all the while a fire bradd
and cold steel. Such, we say, let us
meet with a firm, a decisive determi
nation. Their strength is wholly
made up of an impertiient impudence,
which, when sounded by a good sound
stroke of manly policy, proves to be as
thin and as vaporons as the clouds
that hover beneath the skies and as
easily dissipated as these clouds are
by the warm glow of old Sol's solar
rays.
The whole secret of our future suc
cess and final triumph over wire pul
ling demagogues, who rule and .ruin
the people who pay the taxes, lays in
a close alliance of this people with a
fixed determination to. stand firmly
and faithfully by each other. And
we do not know of any better plan
for the achievement of this gladsome
result than an immediate organisation
by the tax payers.. Let the tax pay
yers call a public ipeetiug in each
ward and resolvo to stand by the plan
suggested by Mhr. Todd and stand by
letter and spirit of their resolution.
Every man has a right to employ
whom he pleasies; no power on earth
cantake this right from hint, and weO
call upon the people to stand by this I
right, and to ignore every species of 2
demagoguery or cajolery but to carry
this plan into effect for the purpose of i
scuring bettetr men in public posi- t
tio- ý:i.f trust and to put down extra
a ,,ee  n o i it,e anld the use of thesel t
,sii,,,:ºul; to control elections and to I
t'ak ,kb thleo unildes thecreof fortunes
to be used iln corrupting those who
have the lprivileges of franchise.
Such grievous wrongs as this lmust be
checked or we are a ruined people.-
Batton Rouge Adrocate.
We commend the above to the care
ful attention of our planters and oth
ers interested ; and if .at preonucertedI
move be llade now, our success for
all time will be secured.

IN DIxAN"r DARKEY.--Our friend, Col.
S., residing not a th'tusand miles from
here, informs us that he has a colored
youth in his employ who has been
with him for some considerable length
of time, and for whoin, as lie has pro
ven himself faithful anld trustworthy,
lie naturally feels sonic attachment.
The yontig luan colneluded a shortrt

the wages due him, amounting to
aboult one lluidlred aud fifty dollars,
departed on a trip up the country.
After being ablsent for solne weeks'
and spending all his money he return
ed and reported for dutty. In a few
days afterwards lie solicited an in

that during his trip Ihe had met with I
it dusky damsel who had captured hi 1
affections, and lie wished his employ

lluest was comiplied with, and in due
course of mail an answer came, writ-,
ten in a very leat female hand, the
boy's sweetheart having evidently
secured as amnauensis it young lady
of culture and relinement. The cor
respondence was kept 'up for some
time, our friend, Col. 1. enjoying it
as well as the parties most intimate

as lnearly as cuall be recollected, as fol
lows :
"I think of you the first thing in
the morning, and I think of you the
last thing at night, as 1 fall into tllh

when the boy suddenly sprang up,

A Good WIESTERN Hi.--We think
the following too good to be lost, and
if not founded on fact, it ought to be:
The funny man of the House this
winter is said to be Mr. Nesmith o
Oregon, who tells on himself some
very amusing stories. Ie served one
term in the Senate several years ago,
and a few days after heo was sworn in
he was passing one of the cloak rooms,
and inside vwere Veessenden, Morrill,
and several others whose names we
can't recall. They hailed himn, invi
,ted hiii in, and after conversing for a
few monments, they asked him very
abruptly.
"MIr. Nesmith, you have come from
a very wild country, where you say
the greater portion of your life Ihas
heen passed. Will you tell us what
first struck you on coming to the Sen
ate?
"Well, gentlemen, when I took my
seat in this august body, esld to be
composed of the brains of our great
country. I was overwhelned with
the strangeness of this one idea, how
I came to be here."
"Oh! Ah! Ugh! So!, And then,
Mr. Nesnmith,. what tfhen-what was
your neit cause for wonder?"
"'Theinext thiing, gentlemen anlswer'
ed Mr. Nesmith, slowly gathering up
his great length, "that came to tme
and pulzled me more than the firpt
thought, was how in the deuce all yop
othler fellows got here ! '
There was a shout, and from that'
day the solemn old fellows, who had
thought to overawe by their pomposi
ty this crude young Senator, were his
sworn friends and never neglected au
opportunity to tell his story.
"Would muy little Ezra,n asked a
fond mother, "like to be a mrissiona
ry, and go preach to thlte poor, suflfr
ing little heathen ?" Tears- bright,
pearly drops of feeling-glistened in
little Ezra's eyes as he muttered:
"Naw, I wouldn't: but I'd like to be
on the perlico long enough to put a
tin roof on the big lummax that stuck
shoemaker's wazx oil my seat, to-day ;
you here ae."
SAn idle young man was comnplain
ing to a prosperous friend that, al
though hlie had tried hIris luck'in all
sorts of fairs and lotteries, lie had
never been able to draw anything.
"Indeed," said his frientld. "Well,
slippose youll try ia hLanld-cart ? You
can diraw that."

handed out a lone woman and led her 4
around to the chalk-niark.

grave, land yet so drunk that you had

-Well, there is at dliltlrcece betw~'een
a hand-cart and a wheelbarrow," he
went on, "hut it doesn't make any dif

cart was the easiest tiling to dtaw
you ,on, and more small bouys couldt
gather around it. I will alter the
complaint to imake it read 'handl--arl,'
and now I want to kniow what you
have to say about it ?"

five pairs of out boots and shoes in
his possession, besidos chair legs, and
cakes of soap, and hair brushes, and
match safes, and towel racks. And
he never had the mnanliness to offer to
give them hack. On thle contrary he
trained that dog to sit f the front
gate, and to seize us by the leg when
we came out three or four times a
week, appare5ntly for the purpose of
securing somle more boots. But we
poisoned him one night, and the next
morning Gumbs threw the carcass
over into our yard. We threw it
back. Gumbs returned it. We both
stayed at home that day and spent the
time handing that dog to one another
over the fence. Then we hired an
Irishman to stand there night and day
to return the deceased to Gumbs'
yard. Then lie hired an Irishman. It
was exiliarting work. The corpse
probably traversed that fence six or
seven thousand times in every twenty
four hours. He became familiar with

Irishmen whiled away the hours by

"In 1871 I cut the vines froin the

dug and housed the potatoes the same

POULTRYIIAISI(xu Iron LADItSK.-
One young etantry girl, Miss Annie
Kirk, of Bethel, I'a., is entitled td
the praise of belug the best lady
,poultryist on record. In 1872 she
cleared $330, after paying for all the
feed, frcight, etc. She commuenled
with cihty fowls-Cclhin, Chinas,
i'trahlauas and other varieties-and
foulnd the Cochin and Brahmnas the
most profitable, being healthier and
of speedier growth for the miarketl
e She fed from seven to ten bushels of
corn per week, and the young ones
s with cracked corn. She is also keep
ing an account of stock this year-an
acconnt which shows every itemeof
e exlpewse and profit-and expects to
r realize as much, if not more, than last
year. When attacked by the pre
, vailing poultry disease, last year, liss
Kirk speedily checked its spread by
t the free use of lime, scattering it all
about and giving lime-water to d:ink.
r An example was given last year of at
lady at Concord, Mass., who raised a
gross value of $350 worth from Dom
iniques and common breeds; but this
was exceeded by Miss Kirk, whose
Sprofits alone are $330. Such efort.s

Screditable in the highest degree, a3n1i
are worthy of general :emulation.--

t. IAiliex CLOVER SI.EU.-A very
B intelligent farmer, born and raised ii
a district where clover seed is a lead
ing crop, writes to the Country Gen
i tleaun:
A point lhere is worthy of special
remark: Where the land was rich,
pl Ipaster used, and the season a grow
- ing one, no that the clover grew rank
' and lodged badly, the seed did not
If seem to suffer, but yielded a goodm
1 crop. The only objection was the
Smowinug. This trpuble, however, only
e happened when plaster was used. It
scseemed to add vitality and give hatr
Sdliness to the plant. There was moro
I "substaucmee,n it was thbught--cer
It taiily more seed. The yield was
t generally from twvo to five bushels, per
t acre and upward, depending mtuch
it ulpon thIe thickness of the stand and
: the nature of the season. Those whio
- ( did not spare their seed (in sowing)
a were the fortunate ones. Those who
had a thin stand, and neglected sow
ing thleir plaster in time, or omitted it
altogether, were among tihe unfortu
nato ones.
SThe medinoum clover Ihas almost so
. perseded the large. Instead of pas
tturing the land, it often, with the
niedium, hasacrop taken tfor hay; this
is done in timne to have the field clear
