When this reaches you, kind reader, if Mr.
Bryan has been defeated, reflect for a moment.
In 1896 it was Mr. Bryan’s radical “Crown of
Thorns’’ and “Cross of Gold” speech which
swept the convention off its feet, nominated
Bryan, and adopted the POPULIST platform.
We all know how his agent, the late Senator
Jones, then chairman of the National Demo
cratic Executive Committee, tricked the Popu
list convention by promising that if the Popu
lists would nominate Bryan for President, the
Democrats would withdraw their nominee for
A ice-I lesident, and accept the Populist nomi
nee for the same office.
\ on have read a history of this in former is
sues of this paper; how Mr. Bryan and Senator
Jones refused to keep their pledge; how Mr.
Watson stumped Mr. Bryan’s home state, Ne
braska, (by the way, Mr. Bryan carried Ne
braska this time, the only time before or since) ;
how Mr. Bryan repudiated the Populists and
Mr. Watson.
At that time, 1896, the Populists were 2,000,-
000 strong.
They held the balance of power.
One hundred thousand votes scattered in a
few different states would have elected Mr.
Bryan, and the Populists had three times that
many votes in those states, but they had been

He gave very explicit directions as
to where we could obtain water, and
then eyed me critically, extended his
hand, and said in minor tone, with
voice and manner somewhat timor
ous :
“John Wilkes Booth.”
No, I couldn’t have been more in
timidated if a thousand Banquos, or
like spirits,, had surrounded me.
For there he was, my old friend.
And I thought he had long been dis
patched or transferred.
“Yes,” he said, “the greatest gov
ernment in the world has killed me.”
He further stated that his identity
was known to but one person in that
part of the world. And that person
was the woman who accompanied
him. “And she,” he said, “is my
wife.” She was extremely dark, but
had a pleasant face, and as graceful
in her movements as a queen. I took
her for a foreigner of mixed breed.
As for him, he seemed considerably
the worse for wear. But there lin
gered traces of his distinguished per

air of a veritable personage bred be
fore the footlights.
And in a minor key he talked long
and earnestly—telling things most as-

Mr. Bryan was defeated.
In 1900 Mr. Bryan was again the Democratic
nominee on a semi-radical platform, —one which
half pleased the reformer and half pleased the
Eastern Gold Democrat, the conservative.
Defeat again.
After 1900, comes another flop on Mr. Bry
an’s part.
Before the Democratic convention of that
year convened we expected him to bolt the al
ready fixed Belmont-Parker convention and
carry the radicals with him.
He could have done it and regained the con
fidence of every reformer in the country.
He even sulked and went to Yellowstone
Park with a sore throat after Judge Parker was
nominated.
But his throat soon healed, and he was
stumping the country calling Parker “the Mo
ses of Democracy.”
After the election of 1904 Mr. Bryan went
abroad, and in London declared that he was
more a radical than ever.
Soon after this declaration of Mr. Bryan’s
he returned to New York, and, in a speech to
an immense throng in Madison Square Garden,
declared himself in favor of Government Own
ership of Railroads.
We radicals were De-e-lighted, and we re
gained confidence in Mr. Bryan,—forgiving him
tonishing’. Wonderful was the de
scription he gave of the thirty days
spent in Washington after he com
mitted that diabolical crime. He did
not say how he effected his escape
from the United States. But told of
his nomadic existence, with identity
sealed, through the land of the Mon
tezumas, Africa, Turkey, Argentine
Republic, Peru, Brazil and in short
the whole of South America, and oth
er notable parts of the world. But
he lost his trump when he went to
China.
There he entered the Imperial ser
vice (incognito) under Ward, an
Irish-American, who for a while com
manded the Emperor’s forces against
the rebels of Tartar extraction.
Booth, as a militay man, rendered
efficient service which soon won the
Emperor’s good opinion.
Well, at this late day, it matters
not how, or what, but something
termed “an accident” caused Ward
to one day tell Booth to lose no time
in getting out of that country.
But he went no further than Shang
hai, which then, as now, was smartly
settled with an intelligent class from
some of our representative nations.
And (still most carefully veiling his
identity) he assiduously cultivated the
acquaintance of a large coterie of the
most cultivated people among the for
eign element. And there Booth’s in
herited love for the stage returned in
seemingly redoubled force.
And as time wore on, he, in con
junction with others, organized a
dramatic club which soon formed one
of the most attractive features in
Shanghai for the entertainment of
the foreign population there.
Booth proved the inspiration for the
entire body, and was the controlling
spirit of the organization—the in
stant he stepped upon the stage was
always the signa] for storms of ap
plause.
But once, while playing the part of
King Richard in Richard 111., he
played one time too much for his
own peace.
Jeffersonian
Walking towards the vast audience
he said in his inimitable way:
—“There is no creature loves me,
And, if I die, no soul will pity me:
Nay, wherefore should they? Since
that I myself
Find in myself no pity to myself.”
Soon the part reached was that
marking the final appearance of King
Richard, and where he and Richmond
clash arms.
And again the applause rang loud
and long. And again the people’s ad
miration was alternated in an exhi
bition of silence—a silence deep and'
death-like, in the depth of which a
voice from the audience, in the most
piercing, startling, distinctive tones,
rang out the ominous name:
“Booth! Booth!”
The voice was that of a late ar
rival—a gentleman who had heard
and knew Brutus Booth, and his two
sons, Edwin and John Wilkes.
The audience caught on and all was
excitement. The pellmell order among
the people —the feelings and recollec
tions awakened by the utterance of
his name, the name he realized was
branded in infamy and heralded over
the world—all together was no doubt
the cause of his becoming uncontrolla
bly excited.
The curtain was rapidly lowered
upon an unfinished play, and with a
living Richard behind the scene.
Next day Booth left China.
His movements seem to have been
mysterious. The last I heard of him
is that he was supposed to have been
sighted on a steamer along the coast
of Africa.
That was years ago.
But before I left the Palaos he
handed me a token which he said his
brother Edwin would instantly recog
nize. ,
The token was a gold medal, and
from the inscription thereon, I
learned it had been first presented to
Brutus Booth while at the summit of
his histrionic greatness, and at the
apex of his fame.
for past sins, and, hailing hijcn as our “Moses
of Democracy,” we expected to see him win a
grand victory for us in 1908.
The day after this Madison Square Garden
speech, the conservative, Democratic papers be
gan to roast Mr. Bryan; soon after this roast
we heard very little from Mr. Bryan on Gov
ernment Ownership.
It was not long before he had become con
servative to the extent of Government CON
TROL.
From one “extent” he went to another “ex
tent” until he reached the Denver-Bryan con
vention.
There he was the Conservative personified.
He was no longer a radical.
He was a CONSERVATIVE, backed by
Ryan, Belmont & Co., the same crowd that
backed Judge Parker in 1904.
There we heard very little about anything
except what is considered conservative by the
Eastern Democrat.
And here let me repeat, the Eastern Demo
crat, today; he was twelve years ago; his
views are exactly the same.
But back to the beginning, the year 1896.
Suppose you had “toted” fair with your Pop
ulist running mate that year, Mr. Bryan, what
would you now have accomplished?
You would have been elected President, and
your name would have gone down in history
as a second Thomas Jefferson. J. D. W.
SOLDIERS IN BATTLE.
A narrative of the battle of Sol
ferino as told by a veteran survivor
to Robert Shackleton appears in Har
per’s. It is, word for word, a chapter
of history as seen by a man in the
ranks. Incidents which impressed
him are curious:
“We halted, and a Tyrolese lying
on the ground cried out: ‘I am dying.
Give me to drink.’ Whereat my com
panion stooped to offer him a flask,
and as he stooped the Tyrolese struck
savagely at him with his bayonet, but
my companion jumped back, and it
missed him, and he said, ‘You Tyro
lese, you said you wanted a drink be
fore you died, and now you shall die
without the drink.’ And he stuck his
bayonet through him as a boy would
stick a pin through a fly.
“The fighting soon began again,
and it was very fierce. It was soon
that we came to know that we were
to capture a little village and the hills
about the village. The village was
named San Maritino, and there were
walled barns and gardens, and the
Austrians were very strong there.
“The bursting of the shells was
very bad. Sometimes all of us close
by would be thrown down and be cov
ered with mud and earth, but most of
us would jump up again, not wound
ed, but always there were some who
would not jump up again, because
they were wounded or dead.
“At the beginning of a battle a sol
dier feels afraid. At the beginning
of this battle I felt afraid, and I
know that other men felt afraid,
though it was not our first battle, and
we knew what it was to be under,
fire.
“So it was that at the beginning
we commended ourselves; we felt like
death, but soon that passed away, and
we thought no more of death, but on
ly of the killing of the Austrians.
“All around me men were killed.
There were heads and arms blown off,
and men flew into pieces like the
smashing of a jug, But we did not
