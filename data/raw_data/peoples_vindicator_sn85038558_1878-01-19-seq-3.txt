It will be seen from a notice to be g
found in another column, that the Catho- c
lie Ladies' Aid Society will give an en- 9
tertainment on March 4th, 1878, for the c
benefit of the Catholic Cemetery and Ii

Chicken thieves are again on the war
path. They recently entered the premi
ses of a widow lady of this city, liviu- in
the house with her daughter and ab
stracted several hens and a rooster. Such
cowardly thieves deserve a mnore severe
punishment than a cattle or hog thief.-
Those persons would ca'bbage the last
cent from a decrepit grandmother, or take
the last morsel from a blind and starving
brother.
Last Wednesda'y there was a general

that yotng hearts beat merry time to

Old Ctr. Merriman had been married
forty.three years, when his wife died the
other week. He didn't appear to miss
her very much until bedtime, when he
sat down and stack out his foot for some
body to come and pull of his boots. And
then when hisson-In-law coldly handed
him the boot-jack, the full weight of the
irreparable loss hti had sustained broke
upon the old man, and he gave way to a
flood of tears. As for the bootjack, it
had ieen so long since he had seen one
that he didn't know tow to use it:
Onr enterprising young townsman bMr.
J. P. Johnson, uiia tappily eonsnmated an
enterprise long spoken of in this city as
practicable but not before undeitaken,
within our recollection. Mr. J., has had a
raft of logs floated from Bayou Pierre and
safely lauded in front of this city, he has
these logA aiwed into flrewood, and is now
prepared to supply .the citi ens of this
plgcb with the bebt of ash cord ii'ood. Joe
is only running a circular saw at piresent,
but we understand he intends to run a
etosacut also. Hldwever we don't believe
the rnmot that he has contracted with
the United States (3overnment, for clear"
ing the gredat ift from Red river, on con
dition that he may have the logs for his
sawitg machine. That's too much.
In another column will be found our
advertisement relative to the establish
ment of a Land Ag3sgy for the purpose
of leasing farms and vaean lands to' re
eponsible, energetic aMd inuustrious set
- tiers. It is scarcely necessary to impress
upon our people the well known fact that
*every branch of business and industry
hinges upon the agriciultural 'prosperity
B and success of our planters and farmers.
There are toneasnde, yea, tens of thou'
sands of acres of as rich, prolific and
splendid land in this parish, as God's sun
ever shone upon. A steady, industrious
population is needed to cultivate these
lands, to make them. bloom, blossom and
become productive, instead of being idle ell
wastes, year after year.
The Land Agency which we propose ioi
will become a decided success, if it but
meets that encouragement which it de- is
serves at the hands of those most 'inter
ested-the land owiners stir up this sub- l
ject thoroughly; come forward with a
spirit of liberality and generosity lwhich
shall exhilbit a desire !br ihl,1rovemnent is
and a determination to climb upward,
not retrograde-a spirit that will encuour- in
age the agriculturist and farmer, and our
word for it this enterprise will prove ne
more beneficial than all immiinigration
schemes, and till our Parish with a robust. all
indl:strious and happy population. See
our advertisement, and respond promptly. IM
