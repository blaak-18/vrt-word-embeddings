OFFISIAL JOUIlAL OF TIIS PAMSH.
luseted at the Lafayette La. PosoOSce as Second
Clams Matter.
SATURDAY, MAY 29, 1897.
The editor who will steal.another
man's editorial is not a fit person to
accuse people of dishonesty.
It is mid that Mrs. Cleveland
wgs , total abstainer during her
stay in the white-house. Now that
this is known, no one but a fool
will blame Grover for going fishing
.so often.
The Gazette congratulates its
friend, John J. Darrieu, of New Or
leans, upon his admission to the
bar of Louisiana. Mr. Darrieu is
a young man of ability and will no
doubt make a successful lawyer.
The City Council of Ruston is
legislating against blind-tigers.
Blind-tigers are a sure product of
prohibition and the only way to
destroy them is to abolish the law
restrictilng the sale of liquor.
Few people will believe Henry
Watterson's latest that Cleveland is
training for a nomination. Per
haps if the impetuous Kentuckian
had not said anything about it
some might believe it to be true.
Yes, knock the stuffin' out of the
civil service. It is an outrage
in every respect.-Morgan City Re
view.
So long as Cleveland was in of
fice Republican editors agreed that
the civil service law was an excel
lent scheme to keep their friends in.
Now it's all changed.
No one should be surprised be
cause the sugar trust controls legis
lation at Washington. Nothing
else can be expected of a Republi
can Senate. It was with that un
derstanding that the trusts put up
the stuff to elect McKinley.
Considerable surprise was caused
by the election to Congress of a
Confederate veteran in Kansas, but
when Arkansas elected a Union
soldier governor it was thought
that the millennium had come. Now
that Kentucky has sent a life-long
temperance man to the Senate, no
one can tell what the future will
bring forth.
A Philadelphia man visited
Louisville the other day and tried
to steal a steamboat, says the
Shreveport Journal. That fellow
is not quite as bad as the man who
dropped into Lafayette three years
ago and was on a fair way to steal
the whole town, but he got into a
fight and had to leave in painful
haste.
Holland, of the St. Helena Echo,
must be a brick. In a recent num
ber of his paper he said:
"Judging from the tone of a
letter we received from Mrs. Hol
land last Wednesday, she is surely
cutting a wide swath down in the
city. Wouldn't we laugh in our
sleeves should the levee up about
Carrollton tear loose and a crevasse
shoot down St. Charles avenue and
scatter her pleasures about knee
deep all over Canal street? But,
if that river knew her as well as we
do, it would break on the other
side and flow west."
Immortal fame awaits the
founder of a political party that
will be able to hold the editor of
the St. Martinville Messenger. It
must primarily espouse the cause
of protection. Everything, that
grows in St. Martin parish from the
waving cane to the luscious dew
berry must be protected. It must
bring under Federal surveillance
every alligator that swims the
placid waters of bayou Capucin
and guarantee to every denizen of
Grand Marais from the sweet ba
trachian singer to the toothsome
crayfish the precious boon of a free
vote and a fair count. The party
that will earn the support of the
Messenger must declare bayou
Millien a national stream and Cou
lee Kini a fit subject for the atten
tion of the Congressional committe
on harbors and rivers. It must be
a party with a platform that will
spoil unless frequently changed.
POSTAL WINS ITS SUIT A
GAINSrT THE L OU ISIANA
WESTEIN ROAD.
The Poital Telegraph and Cable
Company has finally won its expro
priation suit against the Louisiana
Western Railroad Co., in the Su
premne Court through Chief stice
Nicholls. The decision was
handed down this morning, and
while it gives the telegraph conm
pany judgment it increalld the
amount the plaintiffs were origi
nally decreed to pay the railroad
company for the use of its right oi
way from the city of Lafayette to
Sabine river, a distance of xos.r
miles.
The plaintiff won the case in the
lower court and also in the Su
preme Court. The latter court held
that the act of x88o gave the tele
graph company the right of way
prayed for. Concluding the opin
ion read:
"We have reached the conclu
sion that the amount awarded to
defendant is too small and that it
shall be increased. For the reason
herein assigned, it is hereby ad
judged and decreed that the judg
ment appealed from be and the
same is hereby amended by order
ing and decreeing that the rights
described in plaintiff's petition be
and the same is hereby condemned,
expropriated and adjudged to the
petitioner the Postal Telegraph
Cable Compady of Louisiana as a
right of. way for the purposes, and
subject to the conditions set forth
and prayed for in said petition, the
same to rest on petitioner upon
payment by plaintiff to the defend
ant of the sum of $2boo"
This decision is of considerable
interest to the railway, telegraph
and legal public. - States, May zo.
From the above it will be seen
that the decision of the Supreme
Court has considerably raised the
price per mile. When the case was
tried in this parish the jury fixed
the valuation at $8.5o per mile. It
was considered a fair and equitable
verdict, but from the opinion of the
Supreme Court it seems that it was
not. Verdicts of juries in suits for
damages and expropriations are
generally reversed or amended.
The opinions of juries are evidently
not held in high esteem by the
Supreme Court.
Broker Chapman has very luxu
rious quarters in the Washington
jail. He occupies a suite of two
rooms, one of which is handsomely
furnished, as a parlor, in which he
receives distinguished guests, and
the other is used as a bed-chamber.
If he were a poor man blankets and
a bucket of water, and when he
conversed with friends, provided he
was fortunate enough to secure that
privilege, he would have to poke
his nose through an iron grating.
Daily States.
It is an outrageous shame.
Sometimes an accident happens
and a rich man is convicted of a
crime, but he is either pardoned or
granted privileges which are denied
the poor man who seldom escapes
punishment. There seems to be a
set of laws for the rich and one for
the poor. The United States is
fast becoming a country where the
rich man may violate the laws with
impunity at his own sweet will; and
yet some people do not seem to see
why it is that socialism and anarchy
are increasing with alarming rapid
ity.
Let the servants of the trusts and
monopolies continue to trample on
the rights of the citizen ! Their
cringing obsequiousness to the rich
and contemptuous disregard for the
rights of the poor will not always
be tolerated, but it will serve to
hasten the day of reckoning which
is sure to come.
The Sugar Belt Vindicator speak-s
of the "WWilson robber tariff." It
would be interesting to know what
the Vindicator thinks of the Ding
ley abnormity.
There is Nothing So Good.
There is nothing just as good as
Dr. King's New Discovery for con
sumption, coughs and colds, so de
mand it and do not permit the
dealer to sell you some substitute.
He will not claim there is anything
better, but in order to make more
profit he may claim something else
to be just as good. You want Dr.
King's Ngw biscovery because you
k'now it to be safe and reliable, and
guaranteed to do good or money
refunded. For coughs, colds, con
sumption and for all affections of
throat, chest and lungs, there is
nothing so good as is Dr. King's
New Discovery. Trid lrotVle free,

Ex-Senator J. J. Ingalls, of Kan
sas expresses himself in his charac
teristic style on the questions of the
day. He let himself out on the
senate sugar schedule, of which be
said:
"From the Republican point of
view, it would be better that the
tariff bill should fall thana that the
senate sugar schedule should stand.
It is the most brazen and audacious
hold-up of the century. It makes
train robbing respectable. It has
no excuse, except the insatiable
greed and rapacity of the most
shameless squad of plunderers that
ever escaped the penitentiary.
Ordinary marauders are content to
rob a bank or swindle a community.
These brigands propose to. pillage
the nation and to compel congress
ty become their accomplices. The
trust schedule will destroy competi
tion, annihilate the beet sugar in
dustry, and add to the oppressive
burdens of eyery citizen of the
United States for the avowed pur
pose of swelling the already inordi
nate gaids of a remorseless mono
poly. These are the performances
that explain populism, and which,
if not restrained, will make anarchy
possible."
Morgan Lodge No. 371 of Rail

sion from Lafayette to Houma dur

fare and schedule will be made
public later.

Every indication points to a most
successful occasion at the com
mencement exercises of the State
University to take place on the 16th
of June. These occasions are always
full of interest to the people of
Louisiana and our most prominent
citizens from every section of the
State come to participate in the
gayeties that mark the occasion or
to witness the interesting exercises
always held at such times. Besides,
there are boys here from almost
every parish in the State and these
all have friends or relations who
take an interest in the Unversity
and are glad to be able to witness
the events of which their friend
may be one of the central figures.
The old University is fast becoming
in fact as well as in name a State
University and its circle of friends
is gradually widening and extend
ing. The grand work it has done
in the past is its best advertise
ment and to this it looks for its
substantial support in the future.
The commencement will probably
be the most brilliant in its history.

June Ladies' Esome Journal.
The-June Ladies' Home Journal pre
senti an infinite variety of strikingly inter
esting, timely and practical features. It
opens with an article by William George
Jordan on "What Victoria Has Seen,:'
which graphi:ally recounts the progress of
the world in the past sixty years, since the
coronation of the English Sovereign. Com
ing on the eve of the Queen's Jubilee it is
especially timely. The establishment of
Methodism in America is told in an inter
esting article by Rev. W. J. Scott, D. D.,
on "'Wen John Wesley Preached in
Georgia. It narrates Wesley's great work,
his forceful preaching, describes the first
Methodist sermon in America, which was
delivered by Wesley and his Sunday
School, which was the first in the world.
"Uncle Sam's Confessional" describes how
the money paid into the Conscience Fund of
the United States Treasury is received, and
how its guilty senders carefully avoid re
vealing their identity.
Edward W. Bok makes an appeal that
the poor children of the cities be given an
outing in the country during a part of the
summer. He vigorously denounces "be
Offense of the Colored Shirt" also discuies
the "Itch to be Seen." -Lovers of fiction
will read with delight Ella Higginson's
short story, "One o' Them Still, Stubborn
Linds," and Alice S. Wolf's romance, "Her
After-Fame." Charles Dana Gibson's
drawing-"The People of Dickens"-most
interestingly pictures Mr. and Mrs. Micaw
ber, David Copperfield and Traddles, and a
page of Mr. Woolf's waifs gives a most
touching insight into what summer means to
the children of the poor in cities. A song,
'Wake Up! Cupid," by Willard Spenser,
author of "The Princess Bonnie," "The
Little Tycoon," etc., will be welcomed by
every lover of music. Dwight L. Moody's
contribution to his series of Bible Class
articles discusses "Hope" in the Evange
list's characteristic, lucid manner, and
",Droch" chats of "Humor and the Humor
ists."
Among the more practical lines are Mrs.
S. T. Rorer's "Cooking Lessons" on veg
etables and their preparation; "A Simple
way to Swim;" "The Back Yard as a Sum
-mer Retreat;" Lamp-Shades for Summer
Cottages;" "The City Woman's Garden;"
"For Wear in Summer Travel;" "What to
Expect from a Young Man," by Ruth
Ashmore, articles on dress, needle work,
etc. The June Journal is attractive, inter
esting and instructive from cover to cover.
