B longed Rheumatic condition of the blood interferes with the Heart’s functions and is the 7/ ■
I principal cause of Organic Heart Troubles. The history of cases of sudden deaths from BE /Tvr'
Heart Failure proves that ninety per cent of the persons stricken had been afflicted withW swim / k/I
B Rheumatism. All the blood in your body must pass through the Heart, over and over again, U /I 7/1
hundreds of times during every twenty-four hours. Rheumatism is caused by the P vumlHAX* J""?: 1 #/> /I
of Uric Acid Crystals in the blood and such a condition of the blood irritates the valves of V'®)/lV A zj
[ Heart, upon which life depends If the Rheumatic condition lasts, the injury gradually grows more /■
extensive year after year, until the entire structure of the valves is changed.
It is the same as the hands of workers become hard and calloused, the skin in places like pieces
B of horn, from continual contact with irritating substances. The Heart Valves become hard and stiff, the ~y mB
B same as Rheumatic joints, instead of soft and pliable, are unable to work properly, and in time this
inability causes sudden death. If you are afflicted with Rheumatism, you must drive the Uric Acid from
