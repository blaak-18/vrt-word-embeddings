WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
Champion American Comic Paper !
Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
can artists, and contributed to by the
most popular humorists and satirists of
the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the established humorous and
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as ia
monthly, then, to satisfy the demand of
the public, it was changed to a fortnight
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
the political and social shams by its
masterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achioved even greater success than
before, and was recognized as thi ablest
and brightest of its clss. Since thou we
have yielded still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
ing the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Amoug the artists especially engaged
to furnis'h illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton,.Wolf, Jnmp, Keettols,
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to fame.
In its literary departmeuts Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one fitt-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best hunmrous, satirical,
and Character writers in, the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class In every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fas
tidious.

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR BIT
TERS 9" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of VIx
EROA BITTERas in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
•a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of Dn. WALK
ER'S VINEGAR BITTERS are Aperient, Dia
phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious, Laxa
tive, Diuretic, Sedative, Counter-Irritant,
SuJorific, Alterative, and Anti-Bilious.
Gratei'f l LI3. ,, .. .... .
VINEGAR d ITTEnRS the tmost wonder
ful Invigorant that ever u~stained
the sinking system.
No Per-son cat take these Bit
ters according to directions, and re
main long unwell, provided their
bones are not destroyed by mineral
poison or other means, and vital or
gans wtstet fbeyond repair.
Bilious, Remittent, and In
termittent Fevers, which are so
prevalent in the valleys of our great
rivers throughout the 'nuited States,
especiarly those of the Mississippi.
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, Arkansas, Red, Colo
rado, Brazos, Rio Grande, Pearl,
Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companuied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to DR. J. WiLKERa'S VINEGAR
BrrnERs, as they will speedily' remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the samue time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy func
tions of the digestive organs.
Fortify the body against dis
ease by purifying all its fluids witTa
VINEGAR lITTERS. No epidemic cal
take hold of a system thus fore-anrmed.

Erectations of the Stomach. Bad Taste
in the Mouth, Bilious Attacks, Palpita
tion of the Heart, Inflammation of the
Lungs, Pain in the region of the Kidnoeys,
and a hundred other painfil synptoms,
are the offspringsof DI)yspepsia. One bot
tle will prove a better giUrantee of its
4nerits than a lengthy advertisement.

Sore Eyes, etc. In these, as in all other
constitutional Diseases, WALKR:S VIN
tGARIBITTI-Rs have shown their great cur
ative powers in the most obstinate and
intractable cases.
For Inflammatory and Chronic
Rlleumnatism, Gout, Bilious, Remit

of the Blood, Liver, Kidneys and Bladder,
these Bitters have no equal. Such Dis
eases are caused by Vitiated Blhad.

lnking in the system of so many thou
sands, are effectually destroyed andl re

that improvemenat is soon perceptible,
