OF WINN.
Populist Speeches at Natchito
ches.
On Monday last our candidate, I
Prof. C. Vincent, and State ('hair
nman B(ooth, tilled their appoint
nments in thisi city.
'The goodt weather for cotton
picking and the day of the week,
kept nmany farnmers from attending,
hut some of the "old stand bys' t
were on hand, and the citizens of I
the town turned out as well as (
usual-hetter than they (lid to hear t
Judge Watkins, Democratic can- I
didate. t
AIr. Bailey was the first speaker I
•and made, we think, the best speech
he has yet made in the campaign. I
His expression was choice, yet for
cible, his comparisons vivid, his i
raasoning logical and terse, and a
his scope broad enough to cover I
the platform and meet the claims r
of his opponents. His address was c
-elhi received, and the impression I
Ike was good, even with the
Democrats.
Prof. Vincent of Indianapolis,
that inveterate reformer, who was
-the first t, "hreak the ice" fora a
new party in the South, was next c
introducel. and in one of his in
imitable, masterly arguments, he C
held the audience spell-bound for
am hour. His definitions of politi- V
lcoeeoomic terms were the beat
we have ever heard, and his deduc
tiOs of the laws of society and
government, were from indisputa
hie premises and unanswerable.
Instead of leaving the Populist
platborm subject to the charge of
bulag impractical, visionary and
unomnstitutional, the Profteeor cited
lb. practices of some of the high
eat civilizations in the world for
thes use of silver as money, theb
-ovrWna ownership of rlatlrads
nd telegraphs, and government
loam on goqd lauded security, and

Rally in Ward Five of Natchi
toches.
The Plopulist canldidtlte for ('on
gress, Ihon. B. W. Bailey, dlrev
over 4i,0 l l)eol'h to Beulah churc]
in Ward 5, of this parish, on Satur
day las.t.
Elaborate preparations had heei
made for the meeting. and( every
Ibsdy found a hearty welcome an(
seats tinder the old campl) grioun(
shed, where for two hours the,
listcned, with best of order anm
marked attention, to Mr. Bailey':
able defense of Populist lprinciplsh
From time to time, the speakec
was warmly aplauded, and his dis
course seemed to be acceplted~ I
almost the entire audience. Squirt
.1. .1. Horton, the dignified andt ca
pablle chairman, then announces
dinner, which was ample and ex
cellent, and gave evidence of the
ability and taste with which the
fair daughters and nolle matron:
of that vicinity support the cauis
of freedom. Ah! it is wonum thai
has been the pioneer and the d(I
fender of civilization.
After dinner the chairman intro.
duced ('apt. A. B. Booth, of SeNo
Orhlans, who is chairman of tht
State central committee of the Ipar
ty, and one of the best stu(lents of
political economy in the State. Fox
over an hour Capt. Booth enter
tained the audience with one of his
masterly arguments to the satisfac
tion and edification of all present.
Even the one l)emocrat left on the
ground that afternoon, hung his
head in silence.
'Twas a great day for the party
in old Natchitoches, and those from
a distance will long remember the
hospitality and courtesy of the
good people around old Beulah
church. That ward is safe for the
Populists by a two-thirds vote.
B.
Judge J. T. Watkins of Minden,
Democratic candidate for congress
against H. W. 'Ogden, present in
cumbent, spoke at the court house
last Friday to a smill, but appre
ciative audience.
The Judge claimed to be in fa
vor of silver under certain circum
stances, and thought that possibly
Cleveland and congress had done
wrong, but believed them to ibe
honest, conscientious and actuated
by right motives.. Strange ano
maly!
He thought the last congress
had enacted many reforms, but
seemed to have forgotten them all,
save the "odious" federal election
law repeal, and the income tax,
which latter he mentioned at length
three different times, without know
ing perhaps that it was a Populist
measure wrenched from congress
by the Populist balance of power
in the senate, and is not mentioned
in the Chicago Democratic plat
form.
The Judge turned a great laugh
on the Populists by giving a rich
illustration of bow they had rmun
of from the Democratic party just
about '" time," but we would
rdvse the _ not to laugh too
heatil until he gets the teat out
We are very much afraI the
Jdge won't be "in it," though it

is almost inlpassIble within three
miles of this great city, where
mercihants are advert ising for traide
and where a great institution of
learning is ofl'erini inducements
for patronage. We speak of a
section of road from Natchitoches
to St. Maurice. and especially that
)portion from the city to Red river.
There may Ie 1 , e extcuse for the
condition of the road from there to) h
St. Maurice, on accoIunt of the
caving of the river bank. We
make this conmment in a spirit of }
kindness to those who imay te con
cernecl, but as the traveling pub- tl
lie will judge the pullic spirit of a h
country by its roads, we fear the n
road in qluestion may unjustly re- 1
fleet ulnm the public pride of our h
lp'ople. We censure no one, but Y
Imerely call attention to the matter
with the view that it may
i not hie longer overlooked, as we are r
inclined to think it is an oversight. r.
Club Organized.
Pursuant to call the people of
Oak Grove and vicinity, in Natchi- f
toches parish, met in mass meeting
on the 22d inst., for the purpose of
listening to an address from lion.
1I. L. Brian. At the hour alp
pointed a very good crowd had as
sembled. MIr. Brian having been
called to another al)l)ointment could
not be present, but his apl)ointment
was filled by Judte AM. F. Machen,
who entertained the meeting for an
hour and a half with a telling ad
dress on the financial issues of the
day. Everybody was deeply in
terested in his talk, which was well
received. After. the speaking a
c!lu was organized by electing 'Mr.
J. M. Stokes chairman, and J. N.
Arrington secretary... After the
routinc business the club adjourned
t:b meet on the first Saturday in
October next.

Sovereign Delivers a Rousing Ad
dress to Workingmen in
New York. i
NEW YORK, Sept. 23.-General
Master Workman Sovereign de
livered a rousing address before
)D. A. 49, Knights of Labor, at
No. X Union Square to-night. In
the course of his remarks he called
attention to promises which he
claimed the D)emocrats had made
two years ago to "give prosperity
to the country." fo
"Congress was in session almost o
continually for more than eleven P
months, and during that time
starving labor was taxed to sustain
the lives of our famishing poor as
it was never taxed before.
"But during that time three rem- t.
edies were evolved. What were hi
they? There were a single gold by
standard, interest-hearing bonds he
and 'Coxey, keep off the grass.' eCl
"Then they passed a tariff bill,
which no one would father and lit
which the President was ashamed in
to sign, and had not the courage to th
veto. -
"Yet there are still some work
inftmen who do not know from
where the next meal is coming, wl
will shout themselves hoarse from
moraing till night for some old di
prty that is -"aring the' fabric of
soial life on the enslavement sad do
aerdom of God'a homeless poor,t
while the nobler qualities of mind i
and heart slumberr in undeveloped to

renter with the san.li' size farml and
fat.i!iy as the farm owiwr that has 3(

children in family. The renter iutually
has to plant his crop lI, ltly in cotton,

Of which he pays half for land,

He works two months outside his
crop, providned he can get the work to I
do, which ,adds $20 toward paying his
expenses. We find him $71 20 in debt
at the end of the first year. At that i
rate, it only takes a little over two years
to get the amount of one years labor be
hind.
We find over half of our land renters I
in even worse condlition than this. The
day laborer on farms with the same
size family expenses, is the same, only
ihe gets his go(als at cash prices, say :
4 bhis flour, $16 00

He can only get regular employment
for about neven months in the year, at
50 cents per day, which means $12 50 a
per month, counting one day in ea~ch
month for rain, $87 50 t
For odd jobs dluring the other
five months, which he may
get if he is a hustler, 5000
$137 50,
We find him $43 45 short at the end of
the year. Now the only alternative for d
him is to starve it out, as the word goes, a
by leaving off his tobacco and his wife
her coffee and a part of their shoes and
clothes, and live on still scanter rations,
neglecting the education of his children
and all the pleasures and recreations of g
life, bearing heardships, and at last go- t
ing to a premature grave. Now any
thinking man will realize in a moment i
that such conditions have not always i
existed, if they had, the great common
people would have ceased to exist. The
people will naturally ask the question, p
what is the camuse of the depression that a
is brought to bear on labor and the pro
duct of labor? We nd cotton ruling r
in the local markets at 6 to MS cents a
per pound, and wheat the leading pro- tl
duct of the Wr at a price that is cer- d
taluly far below the cost of production. n
