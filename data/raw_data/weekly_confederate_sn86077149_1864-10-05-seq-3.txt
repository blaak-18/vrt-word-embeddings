Reinforcing the Army.
The FayettsviUe Observer fligbtly aiaap
irt!jerided fne .jiat ou which we stated that
the papers of the State, save only the Char
lote Democrat, had not responded faros
to our sug- rtion. It was with reference to
toe tail oi tiie L?i;k-iature that we made the
aoovc rc:r
ci- ftavc v 0 argued at r.ny time in favor
of depicting the n otary producms; c.lassei
to strengthen t;e fighting class. But who
ever will c .-:t his eyes about -him, will easily
discover abundance of material, of which we
have dtrectiy spoken, out ul which the "fight
ing class can be sirengthened." And for one
printer, or -editor, the writer expresses a
cheerful willingness to g ., whenever in the
opinion of otheis, not his own, he can tlo more
good with a racket than he is now dois.
And he thinks the time about come, when
the Press of the conntry, as well as other oc
cupations, should be more in the haads of
tbse not capable of military service for he
thinks that the war might be speedily closed,
if all the available strength of the nation
could be summoned rapidly to one or two
poiuts.
The concentration of the enemy upon Rich
mond and Atlanft, if rightly used by us, is
the bst policy for our speedy success that
the enemy could have employed. A rapid
concentration of onr people in arms, even for
a short time, might end the war. If we can
not meet the i,cmy when thus assailing "us
iu the heart of the Confederacy, it is a sad
misfortune for us.

, , For the Confederate,
j Messrs. Eeitors : I have noticed your
several artie'e upon tb.3 extortion of farmer?,
fhe action of the State Commissioar-rs, etc.,
&c.j and while I do not propose to take issue
'with you in all you say, and while I admit
that prices j-re much Uo high, yet I will,
with ynr permission, call your attention to a
few points upon the other .U ot the picture.
j, 1 ,, , , . , , , . ,
For really, if future -eaerati rs should judge
the precentby newppaper articles alone, thy
would be apt to conclude that the farmers of
the present day were the rno.t heartless set of
extortioners that ever lived, and had done
more to embarras ur cause and oppress cur
people than al others in the Confederacy to- I
gether V. hereas, wniie I do not claim for
farmers an overVnare of p?trioiism, I under
take to say that they have exhibited a much
in this stmsgl as any other c'as ot onr cit
izens, and that the conduct of the government
ncd of the people has been more oppressive
to the farmer than to anv other portion of the
community. And this too, whn all will ad
mit that sonnd policy ami who leaisUiion
would have f&steted agriculture, as .of the
most vital itjteregi to th1 public.
"What ar the facts ?' Last year, in addi
tion to the one per cmt. which all had to pay
on theii cafijal, the, firmer was required to
pay the tenth of ail he raised, even though
he should rftt raio enough to sapprt his
family, to s.ar nothing of profits after paying
expenses ; while the speculator, who left his
borne and -business and went prowling about
the country, not doing anything that would
add to the. wealth of that country, but seek
ing how best he might cheat his neighbor out
of his hnnt labor, hs 1 to pay the tenth of
hi 3 profits, increased by an additional ten per
cent, by a subsequent law. And I have
known persons (o pay their tenth to the gov
ernment, who afterwards had to pay $50 per
barrel for corn . to support their families.
Then this practice of impressing provisions at
a fourth of tbeirvalue, has worked hard upm
the farmers and tends greatly to iiseourago
agriculture. If a farmer will so far disre
gard the necessities of his country as to raisi
cotton and tobacco, he may sA i I them for as
much as he ea.n g?t. but if be raise provisions
aione, they are seized st a fourth their value
aud a hue and cry raised all around him lo
calise be has not more.
Nw, Messrs. Editors, the truth is, a farmer
cannot live .t government prices unless he is
a very lucky man. People talk as if there
was no txuease about 1 .farm as if every
thing the far aier sold was clear profits. They
seem to forget that there is any capital invest
ed, or any expense .incurred in carrying on a
firm. Leaving out el view the cnpiti-I in
vested although the woild seems willing that
eveiybody bat the farmer s-houid realize
something from his capital, ar.d thev seem to
know very well how to tax-farmers but
Jeaviprj the capital out of view, and even then
t! farmer must be lucky if, wnh such sea
socs as wu have had for several years pa:-t,
he can sell, at government prices and pay
his taxes. Lock through the catalogue i
prices, and I ti:iak you will hud provisifi'T, to
