From last week's Enterprise it
is "War to the.knife and knife to
the hilt."
How many charcoal beauties vo

Shreveport is putting a move on
herself preparing for the coming
convention in December.
Rake up another war measure
anad issue more bonds. Another
deal will finish what is left of the
Democratic party.
We venture to say that our pa
per contained more election news
than our neighbor, even though it
accuses on of having been silent.
Oh! may we live until the Demo
cratic party elects a president.
We'Ull be quite wining to pass in
our checks theu.
The Democratic primary for
this pariah has been ordered for
January 11th, 1896. If every
Democrat in the pariah votes, the
total will not reach 700.
They have cheek and plenty of
it. Ordered a primary instead of
having a convention.
If the Enterprise is in favor of
white supremacy why does it ight

Sad pries.i'
_ nder the above caption the En
te terprise of last week worked itself
into a frenzy over the fact that the
Populists "have not excluded the
negro suffragans In express terms,"
and that said Populists "intend,
or. therefore, to accept their votes."
True, we have not refused the
negro votes in 'ex.press terms,"
on and we defy the Enterprise to show
5"0a single instance where the D)emo
cratic party ever did; but the Peo
ple's party had the nmanhoodt and
the honor to be the first party in
this State to offer its ticket against
:ai the field in a purely white primary,
I'o and thus forever settle the impor
tant question of white supremacy.
0o The People's party has not re
ifused the negro vote in "EXPREss
pri TERMS, neither has it elected a ne
gro for City Judge with Supreme
Court powers, as the )Democratic
PCr party did in New krk on the 5th
Sinst.
The People's party has not re
fused the negro vote in "EXPRESS
I«: TERMS," neither has it nominated
its parish ticket in any parish with
negro votes, as did the Democrats
in DeSoto the other day. and as
me they are preparing to do in Red
River and Richland.
It has not refused the negro vote
A- in "EXPRESS TERMS," neither has
it voted enough negro votes to con
vert a 2000 white majority into a
5000 black majority, as the )emo
cratic party did in the 4th and 5th
Congressional Districts last Novem
ber.
It has not refused the negro vote
in "EXPRESS TERMS,' neither has
it registered 1200 negro youths as
21-year-old voters, in a single city
to save a Congressman, as the
Democrats did in Augusta, Ga., Ia
few week's ago.
It has not refused the negro vote
in "EXPRESS TERMS,' nor has it
ever bribed or bullied them for
their votes, perjured its commis
commisioners by voting the grave
yards, the cotton fields and the, tax
it rolls, perjured its returning offi
cers by signing tally sheets which
had never seen the polls, and fill
ing them with more negro votes
a- than the registration-books or cen
1ll cus-rolls showed, like the Demo
crats have done all over the South
, according to the sworn testimony
of leading Democrats themselves.
There are a good many things,
neighbor, that the People's party
,e has not done and will not do, and
r to-day it stands proudly on its
me record made by every member of
State or National government elect
ed by it, and floats the only ban
ner of pure, honest, unadulterated
white supremacy in the South, and
challenges the poor old decrepit,
disgraced imitator of Repubhlcan
.ism, the Democratic party, to
. meet it squarely upon that issue
n and forever drive ignorance, cor
ruption and oppression from our
sunny Southland.
r But the Democratic party, cow
r ardly in the sight of its own evil
Y practices, cringes before the intel
* ligent white people of this State,
and hides its face in shame behind
g mixed primaries, stuffed ballot
j boxes and suborned and perjured
hirelings.
& If our neighbor's editor would
It acompany as through the prish
e we will wager the expenses of the
e trip that we meet more Pops. than
SDems. (towns excepted on msaid
trip.) If you believe we are dy
ing out take us up. Every ward
in the parish to be visited. If you
believe your own columns back
' your judgment, for according to
a your paper we are dying out.
If our neighbor has any thing
more to say about any party want
iug negro votes, it's whole space
can be devoted to denouncing the
Democrats.
We refer it to some clippings
from the Journal Democrat, of
Are tbhe Pope responsiblel BRe

his Lion's dead and we are living.
From the drift of that pretended
article, we are unable to gather but
one fact-that we are.called a fice.
We have labored hard to follow
his erratic orbit of thought, but
d gave up in despair. We know a
n little about three unknown quan

many unknown quantities as that
articles contains completely luz
zles us. We must confess our in
ability to follow him through ob
scurity and oblivion into the do
e main of absurdity. In that par
c titular he is far our superior. It
h takes a mind as obtuse as an angle
of 179 degress, and an intelligence
as opaque as an Egytian darkness
to produce such an original would
d be article. If we were unacquaint
i ed with the writer of that "Epluri
:s bus Unum" article, our fancy
would lead us to the conclusion
d that he'd been drinking-such,
however, is not the case. An ac
e cident must have happened to that
galley. The printer must have
"pied" the article and then picked
a it up and left out the sense. Per
. haps his prolific pencil must have
h been left too long in a solution of
_ whiskey and water, and is respon
sible for the overproduction of
words and scarcity of ideas. hon't
use it any more, such a pencil as
that might cause you to use such
sinile words and paulwrisms of ex
e pressions that there would be (Ian
ger of lankruptin_ our insane asy
lunis: it may lead you to believe
e that had you been in the place of
t Judas Iscariot our Savior would
r have been sold for half the money,
or it would lead you to advocating
the sending of a box of tooth picks
to a famishing community. Throw
your pencil away. If that is the
b best production of which you are
capable and you insist on remain
s ing in journalism you would con
fer a favor on your suffering read
ers by following the example of
the aforesaid Judas. "And he
went off and hanged himself."
Tirxo, LA., Nov. 11th, 1895.
Editor Populist :
I hear that it is circulated that
my brother )David G. Freeman, is
in the retail liquor business, and
that the opposing parties are using
this against him as electioneering
timber. I wish to say to his
friends in the 19th Senatorial Dis
trict, that he (1). G. Freeman) has
never bought or sold any whiskey
- in his own name. That he is su
Sperintending a business for me,
that belonged to my husband, (G.
8. l reeman) before his death,
which has in connection with a
stock of general merchandise, a
stock of whiskey, and that my
brother David has often expressed
himself as being opposed to hand
in g whiskey, but it is rather a ne
cessity with him, as he is a cripple
and not able to do any kind of
manmmal labor. Now this is no elec
tioneering scheme, I am not in pol
ities and would rather David had
stayed out, but as he has been so
faithful in discharring his duties
toward me, I feel it my duty as a
sister to defend him when misrep
resented.
Yours respectfully,
MRS. H. I. FREEMAN.
Other Reform papers in fhe Dis
trict please copy.
The Winafleld Excelsior m com
menting on our statistics of two
weeks ago, wants to know what
became of the votes which the
Democratic and Republican par
ties lost, and the People's party
did not gain.
We would gently whisper to
him, that they staid at home, and
that men who ask for such simple
information ought to stay at home.
Par Tear mteerspaum.
If you haven't paid your sub
scription it's your fault, not ours.
Don't he bashful, but come by and
see us, and while you are comming,
bring your dollar along.
, Sensible.
We want every P,,,puli't notui
nee for an office in this pariaIh,
at from constable upi to senator, to
at act as an agent for this pibt ltwr du
e. ring the camlpaign, and secure one
or morre Slubserilwrs.
<tl Every old liner, who stood lby
it the cradle of the People's party in
Sthis parish should also take up the
W fight and assist us now, when every
it prospect is so bright and the chan
a ces of landing our whole ticket
never will be better.
b- Don't lose your labor of the past
o andi your hopes for the future by
t Ilagging now, but do youri duty and
Z_ all will he well.
It is your duty to help this pa
per because it is your organ in the
parish and the State. because it can
r- and does help you, and because if
It it fails your party iiust fail.
Ile t shoul, he your pleasure to
help this palapr, because the first
ss camlpaign it fought for you was
1- won, and la'eause with your help
t- it will win the next one.
i- You should help this paper he
cause It is worth all it costs you,
in both fronm a Iusiness and an educa
tional st:andlpint, as well as lKxliti
- cally.
t There are three ways to hell) us.
e and each one of you can help us in
each of these three ways.
r- First. sul,scril yourself and
e pay your subscription.
,f Second, get others to subscribe
and pay their sulbscriptions.
f Third, buy something from the
t men who advertise with us, and
tell them why you bought of them.
h There is nothing difficult in any
of this work-none of it half so
hard as the work we are doing.
_ So we have a holx, as we l:aor on
that you will do what we have
f asked you to do. tf.
Id Certain democrats who are a
,' week older than they were seven
g days ago are very busy explaining
s how it all came about, and it sounds
W something like this:
"It was all due to the obstinate
asininity of Grover Cleveland. I
think it will effectually lay that old
fraud on the shelf."-Altgeld.
if "It is because all the democrat
e ic farmers went wild over that 300
pound pumpkin raised in my State
and they forgot to vote."-Bill
Morrison.
"We have met the enemy and
we are their'n-bar'i and all. I
might have known better than to
s bunco Foraker."-Calvinass Brice.
"It was because (iorman was
loyal to genuine denmocracy."
David B. lHill.
"It is because he wasn't."--' ena
tor Hterst.
"About all I can see in it is a re
Spublican occupying my seat in the
senate after March 4, 1897."--IDan
iel W. Voorhees.
a "It was the fulfillment of my
a prophecy that the democratic par
y ty would march through a slaught
I er house ateo an open grave."
- Henry Watterson.
"The immutable rank-scented
b many Hardined their hearts against
I us."-Joe Blackson.
"It is a vindication of 'sound
money."-J. P. Morgan.
"Too many republicans in the
,democratic party." - Allen W.
Thurman.
"It was because I didn't write a
personal letter to the old farmers."

Editor Populist :
', JIr. Freeman, Populist candl
date for. State Senator. spoke at
e Many, on the 19th. 'Mr. Freeman
while speaking received many man
ie ifestations of approval, and at the
d close of his remarks, he was greet
. ed with a perfect storm of applause.
y lie is making a good fight, and I
o feel safe in predicting for him a
. rousing majority in this parish.
n lie spoke at Belmont on the 20th,
e and his hearers were perfectly de
f. lighted with the masterly way in
which he handled his subject. We
a cannot all go with Mr. Freeman
n and help him make speeches, but
we can aid him with small contri
butions. If each Populist in the
I)istrict will contribute a small
e sum, it will help Mr. Freeman
I greatly in his work, and they
d would never misx it.
In helping Mr. Freeman, we are
helping ourselves. If we expect
those we send out to fight our Int
e ties to go empty handed and gain
Il a victory, we will be disappointed.
Then Pop's. let us see who will be
first to send to the Editor of the
POPULIST a small contribution to
be used as above mentioned, and I
would propose further that the
POPULIST publish the amount sent
each week, and by whom. lie
gives twice, who gives quickly.
