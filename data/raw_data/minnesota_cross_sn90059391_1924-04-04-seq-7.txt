WASHINGTON, D. C., April I.
This congress seems to have turned
into a grand jury instead of acting
jus a legislative body as it was elected
t>y the people. Investigation after
investigation proceeds while legisla

yourself as to what this congress is
doing.
The senate oil committee is still
jtilling and grinding away on its in

Over in the senate another com

Klansmen in that state voted for him

surgent Republican group.
In the senate, Senator Caraway, of
Arkansas, goes after Speaker Gillett,
of the house, and charges him with
breaking congressional courtesy rules
because of a recent speech he deliv
ered in Boston. The speaker and
others from Massachusetts get back
at Caraway because he dares to criti
cize the speaker on the floor of the
senate. Its a regular cat and dog
fight at the capitol every day. If it
isn’t one thing of that nature, its
two.
Those who are good at figures, and
that includes senate officials, are
busy nowadays figuring up what all
these inquiries and investigations are
costing tne people and it is estimated
right now that it is going to total
somewhere around $250,000 before
June 30, 1924, the end of the present
fiscal year.
There is no question but that it is
holding up legislation as next week
brings us into April and congress will
have been in session practically all
of December, January, February and
March, four months, one-third of a
year, without doing much of anything
except making investigations and
playing politics.
Injurious to United States
Representative Fred Britten of
Chicago, has just returned from n
two-weeks inspectation trip in Cuba,
and he reports that so much muck
raking by congress is hurting the
prestige of the United States in oth
er countries.
So that the cost to our reputation
and the total sum of a quarter of a
million of dollars a session of con
gress is making our national house
cleaning an expensive luxury.

American Legion Joins In
It will be good news bo Klansmen
to hear that the American Legion
has joined in the fight on the immi
gration question. The Legion agrees
upon the desirability of absolute
stoppage of immigration for the
present, but, in the absence of abso
lute stoppage, demands the strictest
possible limitation, according to an
article by John R. Quinn, which will
appear in the April isue of the Amer
ican Federationist.
“The joining of these two forces,
viz., the American Federation of La
bor and the American Legion to com
bat propaganda for unrestricted im
migration is offered as an indication
of the fact that the great masses of
American people are entirely out of
sympathy with the attacks being lev
elled at the Johnson bill or at any
proposal to restrict the inflow of
Europeans," said a statement from
the federation.
Commander Quinn declares the
melting pot has become impotent
and that in order to keep America a
true democracy, “We should suspend
immigration for whatever period may
be necessary until we provide ma
chinery to teach immigrants how to
live up to the American standards
of living, to our ideals and our trad
itions.”
What Gompers Says
Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, says:
“American must not be overwhelmed.
Every effort to enact immigration
legislation must expect to meet a
number of hostile forces, and in par
ticular, two hostile forces of consid
erable strength. These are composed
of corporation employers who aesire
to employ physical strength at the
lowest possible wage and the racial
group in the United States who op
pose all restrictive legislation be
cause they want the doors left open
for an influx of their countrymen re
gardless of the menace to the peo
ple of their adopted country.”
Opposes Immigration
The national association of manu
facturers is out and out opposed to
restrictive immigration and has so
gone on record. The immigration
committee of that organization has
recommended that congress re-enact
the 3 per cent quota law, expiring
next June 30, with added provision
for administration of the act in such
manner that immigration might be
gauged to suit economic require
ments and meet the nation’s ability
to assimilate newcomers. A perman
ent government policy towards immi
gration was advocated and the ap
pointment of a commission to com
pile data for use in the adoption of
such policy.

Present-Day Boyhood and
America’s Future
There need be little hesitation in
acknowledging that the Order of De
Molay is accomplishing a great pur
pose in America. Taking a boy at a
critical period of his life, just as he
is passing the Boy Scout age, it
guides him until he reaches matur
ity, instilling into his consciousness
ideals of loyalty, Americanism, and
a lofty morality which cannot but re
bound to the benefit of the United
States as a nation and the world
itself as a whole. The speakers at
the sessions in Kansas City, Mo., of
the grand council of the order, which
have just closed, made it quite clear
that in their opinions this organiza
tion is filling a vital need in the
youth life of the nation. And they
showed that they felt that in the fu
ture it would militate to a still larg
er degree for the good of the boys
themselves and those with whom
they came in contact years after
they had ceased to be members of
it.
In this connection, John H. Glazier,
the grand master councilor, of New
York City, emphasized in his address
to the conference the fact that the
fundamental idea of boyhood is
faith—“faith in humanity, faith in
itself, and faith in the future.” And
he added, “What a tremendous
amount of faith it takes in this era
of the United States of America.”
Very evidently, indeed, in the stress
and turmoil of business life in Amer
ica, there is needed a greater
strength of faith than ever before,
and any organization which can in
culcate into growing thought of its
youth and young manhood such a
faith is fulfilling a mission, the im
portance of which cannot be lightly
esteemed.
Of course, the Order of De Molay
is not affiliated directly with any
religious denomination. It does, how
ever, teach in a practical manner the
ethics of Christianity, and thus seeks
to make religion, in a higher sense
than mere doctrine or dogma, at
tractive to its members. It is in
stilling a greater love and respect
for parents and home life, and It is
making for a nobler type of citizen
ship than has been easily attainable
heretofore. From such a standpoint
there is little doubt as to its future
as an organization, for it contains
within Itself the seeds of progress
and success. Its growth should have
nn appreciable effect upon the future
of America for good.
. THE FIERY CROSS
26 WINDY CITY
KLANS FORMED
INTO ONE DODY
Action Taken Following
Conference of Exalted
Cyclops in Chicago
Protestant Americans Now Are
Linked Like Allied Armies
in War •
CHICAGO, ILL., March 31.—The
moat constructive step taken by the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in this
metropolis since the first fiery cross
was burned here more than threi
years ago, was effected last night
when the Exalted Cyclops of the 2(*
organizations within the city limn*
voted to unite their strength in on<
gigantic Klan.
This action was in keeping with a
plan suggested by the Grand Dragon
and is considered a great persona
victory for him as well as a fat.il
blow to those malcontents who havt
worked almost from the beginning
to bring about from within that di*
ruption that the “foreign” enen >
could not achieve.
Chicago has been the scene of a
bitter contest between American.*
and those who would combine the
functions of the church and state
That Protestantism could not always
be victorious goes without saying
when the Klan was open to penetra
tion on all of its 26 Klavern fronts.
The plan of uniting all the strength
of the Chicago organizations into one
giant “flying wedge” of “shock
troops” is not only designed to bring
about results desired by the Klan.
but to make possible an intensive
membership campaign, impossible
with scattered forces.
The dissension within the ranks
here engendered by enemy propa
ganda will be eliminated with the
consolidation of forces and the sur
rendering of the several Klan char
ters. These thousands of loyal mem
bers who have remained untainted
will be brought into the giant Klan
while those unfortunates, who have
listened to the seductive voice of
personal ambition, or who have fall
en victims to greed or subservience,
will be both literally and figuratively
“men without a country.”
Under the plan proposed by the
Grand Dragon, the several Klans in
the city will continue to function as
separate organizations in so far as
their meeting places, social diver
sions, fraternal relations and com
munity programs are concerned.
Their membership is in the giant
Klan, however, and under its mili
tary formation their constructive
activities will be guided by its gov
erning board. This governing board
is made up of the several Exalted
Cyclops. In this way all Chicago
Klanaom will have the counsel of
concentrated leadership, much as the
army has the benefit of a general
staff.
Individual units here fighting val
iantly but hopelessly for “lost
causes” have been likened to the al
lied armies in he world before their
strength was united under a supreme
command. “In unity there is
strength," and under a centralized
command the “shock troops” of Chi
cago Klandom will inevitably sweep
on to victory.

SIDES OF KLAN NEWS
Continued from page 6
is a well-known fact that the greatest
enemy the law violator has in Ameri
ca today is the Klan. The increase of
crime in America was one of the
prime factors that called this move
ment into existence. An d until homes
are safe, and the law violators have
either reformed or gone to Lincoln
to he guests of the state and help
work on the rock-pile, the Ku Klux
Klan is going to continue to wage a
relentless war on those who mistake
liberty and license.
When it comes to publicly criticis
ing a Protestant minister who failed
to administer a proper rebuke to men
who entered the church, asked that
the Naatonal Anthem be sung and
the Lord’s Prayer prayed while they
themselves knelt and made a conse
cration and dedication of their lives
to the Criterion of a Klansman’s char
acter, it savors of impudence or in
tolerance on the part of the criticiz
ing party.
The right to worship God according
to the dictates of a man’s own con
science is distinctly American.
And when Rev. F. R. Stevens is
publicly attacked, for granting a sim
ple request, advanced by men who
have a sincere admiration for his
work aand faith in his Christian char
acter, even though Rev. Mr. Stevens
is not a member of the organization
of which they are a part, it becomes
necessary for this organization to
make a public statement of their
principles.
We are an organization of men who
are native-born, white, gentile and
Protestant.
We believe in the tenets of the
Christian religion, the protection of
a pure womanhood, the maintaining
of white supremacy, upholding the
constitution of the United States
the separation of church and state,
the freedom of speech and press, the
limitation of foreign immigration,
the much-needed local reforms, and
law and order.
Having made such statement, and
organizing to make this program op
erative and effective, we ask all men
to at least investigate this movement
before taking up the cudgels against
it.
Thanking you, we are,
Yours for America,
North Platte Klansmen.

12TH OF ROMANS IS
KLANSMANS LAW
Continued from page 3
Go to the rescue and assistance of
an enemy in distress, as quickly as to
a friend. Serve your enemies and
win them over. Let nothing deter
you from doing good, rot even your
enemies.
Verse Twenty-one
“Be not overcome of evil, but over
come evil with good.”
This last verse sums up the whole
matter in ten little words. Do not
let evil control your life, dominate
your actions, or in any way get the
upper hand of you; but overcome
evil inclinations and influences by
filling your life with good. Be so
occupied by, and so interested in
doing good that there will be no
place in your life for evil.
The Summary
In the language of Solomon, the
wise preacher: “Let us hear the
conclusion of the whole matter;
Fear God, and keep his command
ments; for this is the whole duty of
man.” (Eccl. 12.13.)
As applied to Klankraft this
wonderful chapter teaches us the
following practical lessons and prin
ciples:
1. Sacrifice and service.
2. A transformed life to meet
God’s will.
3. Humility and modesty.
4. The necessary of many members
in one body.
5. Unity of the body and relation
of its members.
6. Definite work of each indivi
dual member.
7. Service of ministering and
teaching.
8. Simplicity, wisdom and cheer
fulness.
9. Abhorance of evil and love of
the good.
10. Unselfish fraternal fellowship.
11. Industry, activity and spiritual
service.
12. Joyous hope, patience and
prayer.
13. Benevolence and hospitality.
14. Returning good for evil.
16. Sympathy in both joy and sor
row.
16. Unity of thought, harmony and
equality.
17. Avoid evil and be honorable.
18. Strive to live in peace with all
men.
19. Seek no vengeance. Leave
that to God.
20. Treat your enemies with kind
ness.
21. Overcome evil by doing good.
What a wonderful chapter! And
this is a Klansman’s Law of Life.
It has kept thousands of Klansmen
from resenting insults, from recom
pensing evil for evil, from cursing
those who curse them, and from us
ing force to meet force.
May God help us, and Christ
strengthen us to walk daily by this
sublime law of the Divine will, that
we, as Klansmen, may prove to our
enemies, “what is that good, and
acceptable, and perfect will of God.”
The unselfish aim of Klankraft is
to make America safe for Americans,
physically, morally, politically and
spiritually. We are building a bridge
for coming generations:
An old man traveling a lone high
way
Came at evening, cold and gray'
To a chasm deep and wide.
The old man crossed In the twilight

The sullen stream had no fears for

your building here.
You never again will pass tills way.
Your Journey will end with the end-

You have crossed the chasm deep and

Klan W ishes to Preserve
Historic Maulsby Bridge
SHINNSTON, W. VA., April I.
Will the old Maulsby bridge be razed
and sold for a few paltry pennies; or
will it remain standing where it has
for more than half a century as a
slient monument to the romantic
days of the Civil war?
The Harrison county court has de
creed that the old bridge must go.
A handsome new viaduct has taken
its place and Maulsby’s bridge has no
further commercial value. The Jun
ior Ku Klux Klan seeing Custer Post
No. 8, Grand Army of the Republic,
fast drifting into the gray gleaming
of oblivion, has written the county
court asking them to spare the bridge
that it might stand as a silent monu
ment to tbe gallant boys in blue and
gray who met on the bloody battle
fields of the sunny southland. And,
not only the Junior Klan, but scores
of other persons are interested. One
appeal has come from as far as Hot
Springs, Ark.
A copy of the letter written by the
Junior Klan to the Harrison county
court follows:
“Members of the Harrison
County Court, City.
“Gentlemen:
“In conformity with our ideals
and principles, we the Clarks
burg Klan No. 1, Junior Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan, believing
it our duty as the future citizens
of Clarksburg, most vigorously
oppose the salvaging of the old
Maulsby bridge located on the
Clarksburg-Shinnston highway,
near the small village of Gypsy.
“We have heard numerous com
ments made upon your action,
and firmly believing that this
time worn monument to the
past generation and to the Civil
war should remain standing as a
fitting structure to remain as it
always has been for the future
citizens of Harrison county.
