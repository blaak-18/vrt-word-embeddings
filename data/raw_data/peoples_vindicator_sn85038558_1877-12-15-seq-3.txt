Mr. II. R. Stevens:
Dear Sir :-Fift.ee years ago last fall
I was taken sick with rheumatism, was
unable to move, until the next April.
From that tlne tuntil threei years ago
this fall I sutlcred everything with
L rheLotiliaistl. Soumetimes there would be
w,eeks at a time that I could not step one
l step; these attacks were cquite oftten. I
siufltred everything that a man could.
Over three ears ago last, spring I conm
- nienced takling \egetine ul tfotllowed it
up until I hatl taken seven Iotties; have
1had1 no rhematisIm since that tie t. I
always advise ev'erylone that is troubled
i with rhenuiatisnm to try Vege.tine, and
not slutfi'r for years as I have done. This
state,i nt is gratuitouls as far us Mr.

Mr. IH. It. Stevens-:
Dlear Sir, My daughter, after having a
severe attck of Whooping Cougllh, was
- left in a tielbe state of lealth. Being
1- ad vised by a frieind she tried hllb, \'ege
t- tine, and after using ita few bottles was
11 fully restored to health.
'- I have been a great sufferer from
- Rheumatism. I have taken several bottles
of the Vegetine tfr this copllaint, and
amu happy to say it has entirely nrued me.
'l I have Ireonollteded the \Vegettine 'to
others with the samie good results. It
ir is a gre:at cleanser anl d puritier of th11
n blood; it is pleasant to take and I can
cheerfully reconmm'end it.

RHEUDATISM IS A DISEASE OF THE
tra BLOOD.
l- The blood in this disease is found to
Li) contain an excess of librei. Vegtino
id- acts by converting the blood from its
ub diseased condition to a healthy circula
tion. Vegetino regulates the bowels
which is very imllortant. One bottle of
00 Vegitine will give relief, but to effect a
tr ermanent cure it must be taken: regu
ad- larly, and may take several bottles. es
SlIb ecially in cases of long standing. Vege.
tine is sold by all druggists. Try it, and
your verdict will be the same as that of
thousands before you, who say, "I never
age foundlll so much relief as fron the use of
0.00 Vegotiie." whiceh is cntionsed exclusive

"Vegetine," says a Boston physician,
2 75 "has no equal as a bloohd purifier. Hear
ing of its many wonderful cures, after
8 00 all other remedies had failed, 1 visited
the laberatory and convinced myself of
4 25 its genuine merit. It is prepared from
barks, roots and herbs, each of which is
2 25 highly effective, and they are compound

tonishing results."
