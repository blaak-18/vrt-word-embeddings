There was something worthy of at

to the convention. HIe expressed 1
himself "profoundly gratified at the
ordlelly and amiable condition of af
fairs at the South, under an excite
nient so general over many States of
the Union." It is our turn now, it c

may sometimes be to keep excitable a
populations in good order. It is pos
sible that our own experiences may

A Lady Killed by Lightinug cWhile
Drawing a Baby Carriage.
[Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.]
During the recent severe thunder
storm which passed over this section
a yoIng lady named Carpenter, a
daughter of David Carpenter, of Ilol.
ley, was struck by lightning and in
-rtatly killed. Miss Carpenter in coin
pany with another young lady, lier
sister-in-law, was walking along the
i oad some distance west of the village c
when the storm canme up. The ladies
were drawing a baby-carriage, each
of them having a hand upon the han
dle of the carriage. They were hnr
yin·D forward as fast as posile to,
reach the nearest farm-house to es
cape the rain, when a bolt of light
ning fell upon the group and iustant
killed Miss Carpenter. The fluid
struck her upon lhe side of the face,
and, passing downward, cut her,
clothes enticely froi her body and
tore the shoes and stockings upon
her feet to shleds. Her companion
was stunned, but received no serious
injury. The baby was thrown from
the carriage and flung several feet
into the center of the road without
receiving even a scratch. The body
of the unfortunate lady was taken to
a farm house near by. She was
about nineteen years of age.
A little girl, w ho has been ipiport
unato for a baby, came down to
breakfast, the other morning, with a
very self-satisfled and important air.
"Now," said she to her mother, "I
guess we'll havo one pretty soon."
"Have what t" asked the mother.
"'A baby," pronlptly lreplied tlhe
soung illncent. "I prayed to the
Lord I;at night to 'selnld ol one, but
of all tlhings not to ecnd a red-haired
one, for we all. hate red hair," Break
fast was resumed amidst a profound
and solemn silence.-N. B.-The
prayer is not yet answered.
A Portlaind Chinanuan became the
fatlher ofan American-born son, and
as he danced aronid, swinging lhis
pigtail and knocking over the opium
jars, he exclaimed: "Me Mellicani

Many young fruit trees, especially
pears, are burned to death durilng the
Ihotlseason. Even when the groind
is kept O'et and their roots are moist
boduglh, young and newly-set trees
uipon whicht the bark is thin and ten
,ler arecooked by the sun as by a
fire, and the branches and trunks die
while the roots remain alive. This
may often be prevented by winding
the trunks. with cloths, which shuts
out rhe -son.

antywhere you please." "Well," said
hle "I will take yon either to Cedar

'Sir, your offer is both grave and

A little gill, where a minister had
bleen iliiied to dinner, was privately
placedon her good behavior. Find
ihg a lull in the conversation at the
t.ble, she folded her hands and said,
"Oh God, please pass the butter."
[Cincinnati Commercial.
Oh, the flies! tlhe horrible flies !
Buzzing around like electiou lies;

Over the butter and into the cream;

Crawling,

The best time to kill a weed is
as soon as it is born, before you
can see it. When the seed has
germinated, and if just ready to
,reak through the ground, then
t'mo least disturbance of the soil

ru dies mn.a hot sun; but if it
rows until it makes roots, if it
Stdisturbed considerably you do
inot kill it; it bia hold upon the
