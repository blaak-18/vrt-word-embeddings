OURt WAIINVITON LETTER.
WASnINGTON D. C., June :l, IN7. \\
collh,
The addition in the Senate of a con- A. II
siderable sum to the Postal Appro- ton,
priation bill as a subsidy for two Wa1l
lines of steamships to Brazil-one mira
from New York and thb, other from
New Orleans-was c.lrir l mainly by
Senator Blaine. HIe made on this E
subject the best of all his speeches for Wel
the session. It is believed the hIouse \VW
will agree to the subsidy. lot
In the Senate yestedt.ay the Senate
disagreed to most of the economical
provisions of the Illonse in the ArmAy
Till. There will he conference cornI
inittees on this bill, of couirse. and rig
the House will prolbably yield many says
of its proposed refornms, metainiug, let carr
I,w hope, that which puts the Army p1'11
;,t not more than twenty tlhousand "y s
men. The Senate did not decide "'"
whether to accept or reject the sec
tion of the House bill transferring the
Indian Bureau to the War Depart
ment.
On the other appropriation hills of l
there is little contest between the
Hlouses except as to matters of ex
pense. The Senate. in every instance, hdue
insists upon increasing and the House sue
upon diminishing the amounts to be Alit
wrung from the tax-payers. a:011
Upon that unmitigated swindle, the M01
river and harbor bill, it is a question >
of comparative guilt, for the Demo me i
eratic lHouse was weak and wicked tliei
enough to propose seven or eight til
millions, of which five millous were pea
unnecessary, and the Senate added wer
only a million or so. This is the bill Mil
upon which the average Senators and 1''
representatives bnild their hopes of c
re election. Zack Chanller and H lan
nibal Hamlin have enosthe Govern
mnent in the course of their long ser
vice in Congress uncounted millions
of money. I mention them only be
cause they are two old and hardened ext,
offenders. Others will he as had Flal
when they have had experience. The '
whole system is one of plunder, and ly 'V
its tendency, besides, is undemocratic.
It ought to be done away with. i c
In the Hlone an agreement was get
reached that the tax on manufactured Cle
tobacco should be sixteen cents per g'
pound. There will be strong oppo. r
sition to this in the Senate. Tobacco tllis
produces more revenue, with ope e- fra
ception, than any of~t t>;p p by
and a reduction and miaputn u ala
would seriously effect the renae i n. w
It would seem to be "dfiidt ft f~
two Houses, in the few days left of pp
the session-from this to the 17th Coi
day of the month-to do what seem rin
to be necessary, and to do it well. It ca'OI
