RECKLESS SHOOTING.
A hection Man Killed From a
Passenter Train
Tbursuav arteruoon asectlon hand,
a colored miiun, while at work on the
roadway of the Sherman, bbreveport
and Southern, .htout six miles from
Jeflereon, Tex , was killed by one ot
two youug men who were on the
train, on whibch were excursionists
going from their bomes in Texas to
visit relatives and friends in Missis
sippi and Tennesbee.
When the train reached Shreveport
Thursday night, Chief of Police Lake
bad several young men under arrest
and a little later Sheriff Ward re
ceived a telegram from Sterifl Hay
wood of Marion couuty, Te;, charg
ing several persous unknown, witb
murder. Amnoun the yonog men ar
rested were c E Rutledge and W H
McDonuald, who were held, but later
McDonald was released by col Waid
on the statements of gentlemen who
were with liii in the car and were
positive he was in his seat aäleep
whe- the pistol bshots were tirtd and
the man wap killed. McDonald waj
greatty rejoiced wheu relrased from
jail as he was en route to Missiassippi
1o be married.
A singular incident of this arrest
Is that Rurhledge and McDonald held
cummisions as deputles of the sherifl
of dill cnuuty, and neither were ac
quainted nor did either, until that
night, know their official connections
Among the party were several v bo
were compelled to lay over ai'd mis
cd the train. The social standing of
these people gave the arrest a sensa
tional tthuge with more or lees inter
eat. Rutledge is held on the state
ment of a young manu who saw bim
pulling the cartridges from the pia
t >s after the shots had been ired.
Friday afternoon Rutl.Jge was plaeed
In Lbohe eaatody of theriff Haywood,
