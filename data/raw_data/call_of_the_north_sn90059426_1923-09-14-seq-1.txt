The Story of Tulsa=-
A Fiction Masterpiece
Tulsa, Okla.—lt is going to
be a hard winter for the poor writers
of fiction now that Governor Jack
Walton of Oklahoma has announced
to the public that he will write the
“Story of Tulsa.” It isn’t every
year that a state capitol is converted
into a fiction factory, but Walton
has did gone and done it. We move
that donations be received at every
book store for the relief of starving
novelists who will shortly need aid
from charity now that a governor of
a state has started banging out a
story —EXTRA, ALL ABOUT TUL
SA. Walton’s brain children are
certainly going to be interesting, es
pecially to the Koons, Kykes and
Katholics. Already the Musty Steers
are shoulting for joy—“ Jack Walton
is with us.” ,
Walton Politically Deader’tu a Coffin
The Governor of Oklahoma has
known for some little time that po
litically he is deader than the pro
verbial coffin nail, but only lately
has arrived at a conclusion that
brought forth the attack on the Ku
Klux Klan. The Governor of the Oil
State is accusing the Klan of killing
him politically, and in his wrath is
venting all the spite in his system
on the Invisible Empire. Maybe His
Highness has figured-that it is pos
sible to unite the anti-American ele
ments in his state so that he may
continue to eat from the public
trough. If so, he is as foolish as
calico kitten chasing his tail.
Governor Walton ha s accused
the Klan of being back of a series of
whippings and said many “very un
kind” things about the movement in
glowing terms. The Ku Klux Klan
has demanded that the Governor prove
his accusations. As one Klan offi
cial put it, “We are more than tired
cf meaningless prattle and insist
on proof.” The Klan won’t accept
blanket statements unless based on
absolute truth. The Governor of
Oklahoma is turning heaven and earth
in a frantic effort to prove some of
the things he has given to the press,
but so far has failed. In no way has
he succeeded in connecting the Ku
Klux Klan with the lawlessness in
the state of Oklahoma. Freely has
he sent forth statements to the world
so worded that the press of the
country can feature his Mstuff and
sell a bunch of papers. But we
come back to the query, why doesn’t
the Governor play his cards? Possi
bly he is holding five aces and can’t
get rid of one of them very easily.
Five aces in a hand won’t look just
right—we’ll bet the Governor is po
ker player enough to know that and
is uneasy. THE KLAN IS
THROUGH BEING THE CENTER
OF UNJUST PERSECUTION AND
WILL THEREAFTER DEMAND
THE SQUAREST KIND OF A
SQUARE DEAL.
No Excuse for Martial Law in Tulsa
That there was not a single excuse
for martial law in Tulsa is a well
known fact in Oklahoma. The Gov
ernor is beginning to realize that he
slobbered on his shirt when he called
out the soldiers and ordered them to
Tulsa. Most of the whippings re
ported in the press were conceived in
the minds of fools. They just sim
ply didn’t happen at all. However,
in the few actual cases of violence no
Klansman has been proven guilty.
But if a Klansman forgot his oath
and took a part in any of the whip
pings, he should pay the full pen
alty of the law and the Ku Klux
Klan will do all in its power to see
that law rules supreme.
That Governor Walton- will 4o
whatever hei ean to connect Klans
men with the whippings is a forgone
conclusion. It can’t help but make
him bitter to know that his rosey po
litical future has changed to black
night. We can expect every wire
pulled to convict a Klansman, even
though he may be absolutely inno
cent. Politicians must never forget
the elusive vote, don’tchernow. Then
think of the publicity the man is

getting. He ought to be able cash
that with some vaudeville circuit for
a thousand smackers a week. Elec
tric billboards would herald Walton’s
coming—THE HERO OF TULSA.
The Governor wanted to join the
Klan and did apply for membership
according to the Grand Dragon of
Oklahoma, N. W. Jewett, but got
only as far as the back door and
then received the information that
he couldn’t be permitted to join the
Great American Protestant Organi
zation. Like a spanked boy who,
when locked in the closet, spit on
everything in sight hanging from the
hooks. Some people never do get
over their kiddish ways.
Just to be real spiteful, the Gov
ernor of Oklahoma issued an order
forbidding the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan to wear masks during
the remainder of the time he (Wal
ton) is in office. There is no law
against the wearing of masks in Ok
lahoma, but that didn’t trouble the
governor in the least, he issued an
order setting himself up as an abso
lute ruler in American Common
wealth. The Klansmen will obey
until the autocratic acts can. be le
gally taken care of. Already a
movement is underway to bring about
the impeachment of Jack Walton.
However, the fact still stands that
politically Waltoh is dead.

-K-K-K
Eyota, Minn.—The Reverend F.
Fry of the United Brethren Church
spoke in his church on the Ku Klux
Klan last Sunday. With a courage
that is an inseparable part of the
everend Fry’s make-up, the Protes
tant minister opened the eyes of
many in his congregation. Conclu
sively he pointed out the great place
the Invisible Empire holds in the
United States today.
More than 16,000 Protestant mini
sters are now members of the Ku
Klux Klan and doing a wonderful
work in their various communities for
America and Protestantism. The
Reverend Fry is not a member of the
Klan, but still sees things with a
clearness that is most heartening.

Daly, Calif.—More than 5,000 per

Klux Klan initiation held near here
recently, when it is reported that ap
proximately 2,000 candidates were
taken into the order.
In the Black Hills, two miles east
of Daly, and in a natural bowl of the
valley the actual “naturalization”
took place. A heavy fog hanging
over the scene lent an air of unreality
to the whole proceedings, and made
the ceremony even more impressive.
Attention KJLansmen
The Imperial Night Hawk will receive contributions for the
purpose of establishing a trust fund for the support of Mrs.
Thomas R. Abbott of Atlasburg, Pennsylvania, and her child
ren (two little tots). As you know, Thomas R. Abbott was
murdered while participating in a Klan parade at Carnegie,
Pennsylvania, on August 25th. This trust fund will be admin
istered by Sam H. Venable, Imperial Treasurer, Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan and checks should be made out in his name.. All
contributions should be mailed to the IMPERIAL NIGHT HAWK,
P. O. Box 1204, Atlanta Georgia. The contributions will be ac
knowledged in the columns of the official publication of the
Klan. Klansmen, here is a chance to do something very worthy
ndeed.

MOWER COUNTY
FAIR BOARD ON
ANTI-KLAN MOWER
In Spite of Opposition
a Good Meeting Place
Has Been Secured.
COMMERCIALIZED AMUSEMENTS
THAT SAVOR OF VICIOUSNESS
MAY USE FAIR GROUNDS, BUT
NOT GOD-LOVING AMERICANS.
Austin, Minn.—The Mower County
Fair Board in official session refused
to grant the Austin Klan the use of
the fair grounds for a religious and
patriotic program. If a cheap, taw
dry, questionable, money-grabbing
outfit sought the use of the fair
grounds, little difficulty would be
experienced in securing the same? A
circus with all its camp-followers,
(lewd women and bunco-steerers)
rented the fair grounds and used the
grounds in various ways, but the
great American, Protestant organiza
tion known as the Ku Klux Klan was
told flatly that it was useless to ex
pect the use of the grounds. Out
side men and women organized to get
easy money by appealing to deprav
ity have had little /trouble getting
fair grounds for their nefarious
business, where Christian men band
ed together for a most noble purpose
have been scorned and ridiculed. We
will wager that a “colored,” suggest
ive “animal-dance” aggregation would
find little trouble in getting the
Mower county fair grounds. We
may be mistaken, but are drawing
conclusions from the past records
showing the kind of attractions that
have used the grounds. We have yet
to see a carnival that was fit to ad
mit to a town, yet a carnival com
pany did use the Mower county fair
grounds. It is possible that the car
nival company which rented the
grounds was’ different than the gen
eral run of these vicious, money
grabbing concerns, but we doubt that
very much. The average carnival
company is “pedigreed” in Hell and a
menace to the morals of any commu
nity. The members of the Mower
county Klan are clean, wholesome,
Christian men, standing well in their
communities and seeking only that
which is best, yet they have been
coldly turned down by the Fair Board
When they sought the use of the
grounds for a laudable purpose. That
two-for-penny outfit traveling around
presenting “Uncle Tom’s Cabin”
most grotesquely was granted per
mission to use the fair grounds. We
can’t quite grasp the kind of a pea
nut that accepts a Wild .West show
and rejects a Protestant organization
composed of the best elements In
Mower county. Isn’t there a “nig
ger” in the woodpile somewhere?
As it happens all the members of
the Mower county fair board are
Protestants. We have seen men
classified as Protestants that didn’t

dare to say that their souls were their
very own when a question of any
kind was raised. We would like to
know if fear of an organized relig
ious minority drove the Mower coun
ty fair board to act against the Ku
Klux Klan. It would be very Inter
esting to learn the truth about the
matter, to say the least. In the
meantime there is nothing to do but
draw conclusions.
Here is the situation. PROTEST
ANTS HAVE BEEN DENIED THE
USE OF THE MOWER COUNTY
FAIR GROUNDS FOR RELIGIOUS
AND PATRIOTIC PURPOSES. At
the same time rank outside concerns
have been permitted to occupy the
grounds using same in a way that
certainly was of no benefit to any
body except the “fleecers.” The
Mower county people support the
county fair and now when they seek
the use of the fair grounds for a
splendid program that is both Christ
ian and American, and nothing else,
they get a turn-down. The Mower
county people are up in anger against
the action of the Fair Board. It is
a satisfaction that memory will re
tain facts for many months.

Pipestone.
—K-K-K
Pipestone, Minn. —At an open meet
ing Dr. W. S. Harper, National Klan
lecturer, spoke to more than 300 pecf
ple here. From those who attended
the meeting we get statements that
classify Dr. Harper’s address as one
of the finest lectures on Americanism
that has ever been given in this city.
A local Klansman donned a rebe
and went into the street annoucing
the K. K. K. lecture. One of the
local policemen, member of the Ro
man Catholic church, made it a point
to speak to the robbed Klansman and
shouted in a nasty way loud enough
so that many heard him—“ Get the
hell out of this town.” Some cab
bages in a garden think that they own
the whole garden because of an inner
swelling. It was so with the Pipe
stone policeman. If any Red-neck
thinks that a bellow of profanity
scares a Klansman, he is badly mis
taken. The Klan and Klansmen have
had all the abuse from the cross
backs that should be stood for.
There are legal ways to reach these
blow-pigeons and they will be used.

FOUR RECENT ANTI-KLAN MOBS
POINT TO ORGANIZED HATE AS
INSTIGATOR OF LAWLESSNESS
Carnegie, Pennsylvania, Perth Am
boy, New Jersey and Steubenville,
Ohio, as the result of mob violence
during the past month are either
mourning their dead or nursing their
wounded.
Klansmen in company with all
other law-abiding Americans, are
wondering why.
In these three towns the Constitu
tional right of peaceable public as
semblage, the right of free speech,
the right to openly advocate the
decent and better things in life ap
parently are mere theories to be
combatted by the black jack, bomb
and automatic pistol.
Some powerful influence, sojne
malign, submerged and secretive pow
er is at work, so it seems, to crush
the greatest movement for patriot
ism, Protestantism and law observ
ance which has swept this country in
a century. Its present and startling
method is organized mob violence.
Out In the Open
_ Propaganda has failed, bribery has
failed, lies, slander and newspaper
slime has failed and now anti-Klan
fanatics are out in the open with
knife, torch and revolver.
Because men dare gather to praise
God, to sing the national anthem,
to clasp hands in the sacred cause of
reverence to the flag of their country
and their national ideals, are
beaten, slain and spit upon..
To don the white robe, regalia of a
great Protestant American order, in
some parts of the United States dur
ing the past few weeks seems to have
become a summons to sudden death
at the hands of hidden assassins.
A peaceable meeting of Klansmen
in certain sectarian-controlled cities
in America means a riot call.
Since the quaint old trades guilds
trudged beneath their banners along
the cobblestoned streets of medie
val Europe secret societies have been
granted the public and indisputable
right to parade.
Every fraternal order in this coun
try, since America was gloriously
founded, has by right of Constitution
been permitted the unhindered priv
ilege of peaceable assemblage.
All but the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan in this enlightened year
of our Lord, 1923.
Frenzied crowds don’t shoot Shrin
ers because they march in Oriental
and peculiar garb. They don’t kill
Knights of Pythias because they meet
secretly and quietly in their own fra
ternal halls.
But Klansmen are being killed and
beaten on the public streets and
mobbed and pummelled in their own
private meeting places.
Organized Violence
No curiosity seeking crowd of
American men, women and children
is stirred to resentful violence by
the appearance of white-robed figures
carrying the American flag, led by
the blazing emblem of their religious
belief and singing the same hymns
with which years ago their mothers
moulded music into their chiK&ood.
But in several crowds of recent date
watching Klan parades the elements
of violence have been there, carefully
posted on the side lines by the pow
erful forces which have determined to
stamp flat this true American move
nient which menaces their schemes to
control and rule America and set its
laws aside at will.

Local leaders of certain religious so

week by forcing their way into a

members and hounding them across
the roof tops of adjoining buildings.

At Steubenville, Ohio, suspected
bootleggers ahd police court char
acters were in a mob which assaulted
Klansmen as they left their hall after
a quiet and private meeting, over
turned their automobiles in the
streets, kicked them, beat them and
overwhelmed them through sheer
weight of numbers. At Steubenville
also, a man said to be a leader of the
Klan, there, was ambushed in the
darkness by % dozen cowardly thugs
as he was on his way to his home.
Badly wounded himself, he drew his
pistol and fired. When the smoke
cleared away three foreigners, some
of Ellis Island's choicest crop from
Sunny Italy, were bound for the hos
pital.
It is circumstantial happenings
such as these which make the think
ing public wonder what is behind the
recent series of assaults upon lawful
and peaceful gatherings of the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
Autumn Fruit
While this newspaper does not cast
suspicion on any person or persons,
yet it is well to rememer that sum
mer seed brings forth autumn fruit.
Two conventions of so-called Am
erican societies, known as being the
closest oath-bound orders on earth,
were held this summer on foreign
soil. They met in Canada where
probihition laws irk not and the call
to the thirsty is a lure to lawlessness
and inflamed and radical thinking.
These two big societies, whose mem
bers are all of a creed in anti-pothesis
to the Klan’s determined attitude of
keeping separate church and state, in
public meetings announced that the
Klan must be crushed.
It was told to the world through
the press that the Knights of Col
umbus and the Ancient Order of
Hibernians, gathered north of the
Canadian line, would fight the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan to a
finish.
The messabe of the Knights of Col
umbus was couched in better gram
mar than that of their Fenian com
patriots, but it meant the same thing.
War to the knife!
If this ultimatum was so boldly
heralded from the convention floor,
what happened in the privacy of com
mittee rooms where ways and means,
policies and resolutions were worked
out?
Action Is Decreed
Clever men, veterans of many a
political campaign for their religion,
discussed from all angles the rising
menace of a United American Protes
tantism to their cause. They intro
duced resolutions decreeing a fight on
the Klan and these were adopted with
vim and enthusiasm by the rank and
file of dusty throated, green badged
delegates anxious to break away from
convention hall and get their feet once
more on a bar rail. ' 1
The resolutions, we may be sure,
were not passed as mere child’s play
nor as a meaningless gesture of hate
and contempt. They were submitted
and adopted as a part of a carefully
thought out plan of attack.
Possibly the attack is directed
through the press or through the
properly constituted courts of the
land. Such efforts to disrupt and dis
perse the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan are welcome. The order has
been officially probed and counter
probed and found always consistent
with its high American ideals. It
always will be.
But such lines of attack have
been intensified since the Canadian
meetings. - Mob violence, well organ
ized, has broke out in many sections
of the country since that time.
Therefore, Klansmen must draw
their own conclusions as to who and
what is back of the martyrdom m ot
their brother Americans.
