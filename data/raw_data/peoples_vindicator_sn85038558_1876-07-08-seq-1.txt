The Negro in the Presidential E
Campaign.
I New York Srn ]
As a factor in the comning contest P
for the Presidency, the blacks, as a 1i
race, will not play the part they have ni
hitherto done for the Republicans. Af- bh
ter being used ahd abused since the el
close of the civil war, and while re- d'
leased from one form of slavery re- n'
-nanded to other evils, they at last rt
have had their eyes opened, and will ''
-o longer obey the orders of their 'I
late political masters.
The thievery of the carpet-baggers, al
hvbo stole from white and black '
Fromiscuously, and the plunder of the ti
Freedman's Bauk by Grant's Wash- ry
ingt.ouing and their pious confede- is
tatci v ae' Jienated this confiding n
people' im their accustomed lead- ti
brs, and brought them to a sense, of ti(
the frauds and villainy of which they pi
have so long been the victims. They
have come to see that the policy of in
eRnpnubhcans in exciting prejudice in
..gainst their old masters, and inspir- ar
Slog them with distrust of their best in
friends, was only a part of the symt- 611
tem for capturing their votes while cu
stealing their earnings and labor. th
Consequently there has been a great Ci'
teaction all over the South, and at no in
time since the rebellion closed have pC
the relations between the two races Pc
been as good as they now are. an
The dal that the army was with- i"
drawn from the South as a ruling ele- fei
ment by the loud demand of North- mI
ein opinion, the carpet-baggers, seal- an
awags, and adventurers, who held Pa
their power by the support of the th
toihtary alone, were crushed out be- n°
yond any hope ot recovery. So long th
as they could call for troops from so
Washington, and hold themn subject P°
to the, orders of partisan marshals tri
'Ind managers, the negroes supposed Ra
niaturally enough that they represent- in
ed the Government, as they were a I
backed by it. When that symbol of tel
*uthority was removed, the whole in
fabric of knavery and violence fell ty
to pieces. The blacks are timid, gre
garious, and superstitious, and it re- de
auired nothing more than this ensud- th
den change ofcircumstances to eman- ri¬
cipate them from their political bon- th
dage, and to open tip to their limited I"
horizon new and better prospects for P"

How to Secure Good Nominees. T
(From the Now Orleans l)emocratl
Nearly every man in the State ex
presses the opinion that the material
interests of the State imperatively de- he
mand a reform administration. La- tic
borers; mechanics, merchants, bank- pr
ers and planters aflirmn their earnest ,n
desire for the election in November of
next of honest and capable men, and ti,
re-establishment of legitimate and ha
economical government in Louisiana. sil
This desire is proper and common te,
dable, but it does not seem to us that foi
all classes are pursuing that end by till
wise and practicable means. The i:.
time is approaching when the prima- If
ry conventions are to be held, and it oi
is the primary conventions which will th,
most largely influence the itnila- fal
tions. let we do not find a disposl- cai
tion among certain classes of our pee- lni
pie to enter cordially with their fel- th.i
low-citizens into these important pri- let
maries. On the cantrary, we tind
men talking down the conventions ca
and those who take sufficient iqterest eit
in the welfare of the State and the firs
success of the Democratic party to titl
organize and attend them. We hear !tl
the saute old pulaver about politi. un
cians, ward bummers and stocked col
meetings, and notice the same dis- ott
position to stand aside and let the ref
politicians and ward bnummers stock e
and control the conventions. If it be
indeed true that the' class of men re- tihe
ferred to control our politics, it is Im
more solemnly the duty of nerclytnts (lal
and others industrial classes to take the
part in our public affairs to prevent hlit:
things from going to the bad. It is tli
not creditable to men, however rich
they may be or however high their be
social standing, to affirm that the It
politics of the State are being con
trolled by impure men, and at tie lhe
same time to refuse to aid good men of
in reforming the party. We live inact
a free country were all men are vo
ters, and the men who attend meet- el,
ings and conventions, and do the par- bai
ty work, are apt to make nominations bia
to suit themse'ves ; and those who tni
decline a just and honorable share of tir
the labor and responsibility, have no doi
right to censure. We do not pisume tle
that there is any class in the coml
munity so week and foolish as to sup- chi
pose that the working men are going
to concede them the privilege of
holding private meetings in back
parlors and private counting-rooms
to dictate the. nominees for whom we
are all to walk up and vote. All this l
twaddle about politicians and bum
mers is wrong, because It is idle; it tile
will eform no evil and it will ac the
complish no result, If any man is nii
sufficiently interested in the welfare

charge his duties as a citizen, and 'Th

tihe piimarics, and thus secure a con- its
vention which will nominate lion- ot
est and capable men to govern the tie

When all classes of onr community
shall adopt this advice a better era mi
will dawn upon us; our people will
understand each other better; bum- col

honest working men will co-operate fat

Lc
In his speech on Hayes before thie lot
lateRepublican Convention, ex-Gov- TI
ernor Noyes said lie had defeated snc- t
cessfully 'Ihuraiam, Peindleton and si
William Allen. This was true, butno
not a good point. If any one chlooses rel
to investigate he will find that Hayes lou
is not a strong candidate even in his an
own State, and each time that lie tl
hls been elected it has been by the
"skin of his teeth." He first ran fqr 1
governor against Judge Thurman in
1867. The year before the Republi
ecan candidate for Secretary of State gl
had been slected by a majority of 42, f,
696. Iayes received about thirteen li
thousand votes lessi and Ihis majority tr
was only 2,983 while the excellent
leadership of Thurman gave the De
mocrats the legislature for the first to
time in ten years. The next year tle t
Republicans carried the State by 17,- di
383, and Grant had a mojority of.41,
429. Thie year afterj 1869, Hayee gs
was again a candidate for Governor
when the Republicano majority drop- to
ped to 7,517, but the succeeding sear,
when Hayes was not on the ticket, it
rna up to 13,831. Last year wlhen
nly5le was on t. tioet-  ain. A
len he got through with the meagre a
majority of 5,544 in an aggregate vote
of W!),6833 Daring fifteen campaigns fa
in Ohio, when Hayes has not been on
the ticket, the average Republican '
mqjority has been 28,915 Jin the tlhree bI
electtions when his name headed the
ticket the majmelty has averaged but
5,118. His majorities have been 33,
567 lees than the average of his party.
Tlhere is nothing about such a can- a
didate hard to beat. Under tile d
changed condition of things it is not
mlaprobable lie ma, be beaten in his
own Republiash LState.

The Independents Don't En
thuse.
From the W'estliche Post.
The abominable way they have
here In this country of running na- tl
tional political conventions almost h
precludes the possibility of the nomi- t
nation of a manu of prominence and
of universally recognized ability for 1
the presidency. For years this fact tl
has been patent to every one, and b,
sinlce the Cincinnati Convention yes- .(
terday perhaps more so than ever be- o
fore. Of all the candidates before tl
that convention, the one least known, P
Hayes, of Ohio, bore off the victory. o
If the man was ever heard of at all Ct
outside of his own State, it, is due to ,
the remarkable campaign in Ohio last of
fall, in wlidch le, as the Lýr.a-nTrey th
candidate, was, by I the help of the at
Independents, elected Governor over cl
the inflationist, Bill Allen. 11ayes' i,
letter of acceptance has not been
published yet, and until it is, we don't si
care about taking a decided stand ti
either for or against him. We must si
first know the position lie expects to sl
take on the leading questions of the fu
day. If he declares himself in clear, fa
unmistakable language against the fe
corruption in the civil service depart- lJ
ment of the nation and folr thorough ty
reform there, then we might in some e
measure reconcile ourselves with his bi
nominlation, and particularly in case tl
the Democrats do no better, and the
Indepedependents should place no candi
date of their own in the field. That
the Republican National Convention hlt
has not come up to the demands of
the times, must be admitted by every R
one, but the nolination could have th
been worse, and that is something. tit
It is evident that we are not to have l
1 Centennial campaign after our own to
hearts. Mr. Hayes is neither a man fr.
of much talent nor of force and char- th
acter. He was not born to be a lead- to
er, but, on the other hand, he re- bq
quires one. and were he to fall into in
bad hands, lie would probably be pl
misled. A man of such a weak na
ture is hardly the man for the great lit
need of the timnes. They might hIave gr
done worse at Cincinnati, but, too, in
they might have done much better, t.
and we're afraid they've let a good Li
chance slip.--Carl Shur,'*s. on
_-- th
War Prejudice.
From the Baltimore San.
The Philadelphia Enquirer, a Re
publican journal, says that "the VC
newspapers of the country-those of iD'
the North, East and West, as wetl as is
those of the South-very generally an
and very properly denounce the ma- ,
ju lent &4 Tirterseip tRime "of'llie
battle of Gettysburg to occupy a of
place in the American department." cli
The Enquircr gives two excellent rea- P
sons why it should not be there-one, y'
its want, of merit as a work of art, ki
and the other, its offensiveness to `
thousands of guests who have been bt
invited to join the Exposition. a
It seems that Rothermel was com- t
missioned by a committee ot the
Pennsylvania Legislature to paint av
commemorative picture of the battle
of Gettysburg, paying him a price
far beyond any that lie ever before or C
since received for his work, or more I
than his work, in this instance, was ct
worth, Indeed, the Inquirer states, 0
after it was painted and paid for, the P
Legislature partially declined to re- d
ceive it, atjlit never had a place al- ft
lotted to it by the Commonweatllth. P
The artist seems to have the thought l
that hlie could best accomplish his mis- S
sion by mnaking his picture express 0
nothing but sheer brute force, and by 51
representing those who fonught on the
losing side as men of the most brutal Y
and ruffianly type, and all those of 8
the winning side as of the pohlest and 3
most heroic type. The Inquirer con- o
siders its presence in the Art Gallery
as "an insult to all our Southern I
gnests," and that, in addition to itsl
glowinga hd monstronus defeats as a
work of art, "the Art Comfmittee pub
licly declared that no picture illus
trative of scenes in tihe rebellion r
would be accepted for exhibition." s
So far, however, as the Soutlhern visi- I
tors are concerned, wehardly suppose
them to be so thin-slkinned as to be
disturbed abount thie picture on other
grounds tihan that it is a poor work of I
art. If it were really a god'pieture,
we have no doubt they would be in- a
terested in its study, -
There is a cheering sign noticeable I
with aii Jltti,4w' downar ln ,mtit'!
land, in connection with the uonifia
tion of Hayesi which is, the entire I
failure of the radicals to enthuose.
Such a nomination falls like a wet
blanket on the carpet-bagger and
scalawag i a doubt is raised in his
mind if he will be permitted to steali
the will and the way they still have,
and consequently they have been
e dumb and calm since the Cincinnatti
Conventio,.

Cows for the Farm,
The Pr;atle Farmer sums ins up
the matter of what sort of *ws to
have on the farm: The pai'ular
breed beslt suited for genert farm
purpposes may be a matter of tinion ;
but whatever breed may be dected,
there is still a piaterial distittion to Sill
be observed between the lon of a
cow intended for th0i dairy ad that
of one intended for ~tteuning. While
the latter should posess as early as
possible all the pdints of :o best

contrary, be thin and hollM in the

chin, nor showing in any part much

should be full and round, yet thin to
the touch, and should e of equal
size and substance tlrouonut. If it
shows more behind than t does be
fore it is deemed a sign of the milk
falling off soon after caling, and if a

be found not to contain a arge quan

equal distances and shodd neither
be very large nor very thick towards
the udder, but nearly equa, yet end
ing in a point.
How to Set Out Roses.-Make a
hole so large that the iootl may be J
.spread out nicely. Cover the roots Al
with fine soil, rather deeper than
they were grown, and paik down
tightly with the hand. It is general
ly best, though not always mcessary,
to protect the plants for a few days aGl
from the sun and chilly wiuxws-until st.
they become somewhat :iccnstomed
to their new position. Paper grocery P..
bags are nseful flor this purpose, turn
ing the bags colmpletely over the M
plant, and supporting this with one
or more small sticks--heping on a
little earth to keep it in place. If the
ground is dry watet thoroughly, soak
ing the earth down to the roots of
the plants. Do not water too often. M
Like persons, rose plants want water
only when thirsty. Let them get
thirsty before giving them drink.
Red Clover.-The Holly Spring Re
porter has this to say of the red clo- Al
ver crop, which was once considered
impossible to raise in Mississippi. It V
is only another evidence of the fact Re
announced years ago by Galileo- Su
"theWPMº% ee. i inriant lots
of clover. It grows as well in this
climate as in Kentucky, when pro
perly sown amid taken care of. The
yield this season has been large. We
know of one plot of ground from
which three cuttings have already
been made. O.,e acre of clover will
afford feed for ten horses, ten cows,
twenty hogs and thirty sheep, from
the 1st of May until the 1st of No=
vember.
Orange, Peach or Fruit Padding.-
Cut up five good, sweet oranges of
what is better, some nice peaches; of [
course they must be free from seeds
or stones and the skins be removed;
put them in a very large pudding
dish ; pour over them one-half a cof
fee cup of white sugar. Now set a
pail containg a pant of milk into a
kettle with a little boiling water.
Stir together the yolks of two eggs,
one-half a cup of sugar, two table
spoonfuls of corn stnich and a little
cold milk; when your milk boils in
your pail stir this in and add a little
rsalt, let it thicken, pour this oirer
Syour peaclhes. Now beat the whites
of the two eggs to a stiff froth, add a
Stablespoonful of pulverized sugar,
Spour over your pudding, and set in a
hot oven just long enough to brown.
Eat cold.
Good Miolasses Candy.-2 pounds (I
white coffee sugar, 1 quart molasses
Ssirup, 3 tablespoonfuls of vinegar; .
- pat in a small piece of butter. You r
Sdcan tell when it is boiled enoughli by '
Sdipping your finger into a cup of cold
r water, then into tihe candy, quickly
f back into the water, and if that
whichl sticks to your finger is hard
- and snaps, the candy is done, and
should be poured upon a greased
marble or tin-pan; add a little es
s sence of lemon, then pull it till it
r becomes white,
1oney-liio or Mmid.-'Io a gall
e laon of water, put 2 pounds of honey
and I ponod of ensugar; boil for an
i hour, put in the whites of four eggs
to clarify, aind skim it quite clear, 0
while boiling; then put into a clean c
s tub, and let it stand for a week, put
ring in a toast with honey to make it u
work; then prit in a dask, adding the
peel of three or four lemons, let it
a stand for a month, and then if it is
Ii not soufficiently fine put in more honey,
and let it stand longers,
s Cold Slaw.--Cat up the cabbag t
b very fine with a sharp kaife, and
sprinkle over it a teaspoonful of salt.
SFor a large dish, say a quart of cut
n cabbage, use 2 eggs, a piece of butter
f- the size of an egg, j teacup of water,
fand f teacup of good vinegar. Beat
the eggse, whites and yolks together,
very light, add the water; vinegar
and batter, and pdt all in a tin on
the fire, stirring all the time until it
is of a creamy thlickness. Poar it
hot over the cabbage, stir up well
with a fork, amid leate to cool.
