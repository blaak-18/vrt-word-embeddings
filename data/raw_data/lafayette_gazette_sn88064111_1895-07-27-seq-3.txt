An Ice Factory.
Now that it is a settled fact that
we are to have a refinery, there is
something in the air which may de
velo-p into a movement that is likely
to result in the erection of an ice
factory. That we have not already
an ic:e factory is a puzzling question
to every one who has given the
matter thoughtful consideration,
for a. rich harvest awaits tho:ýe who
will be the first to invest some
money in such an enterprise in La
fayet te. Some days ago the
Messrs M'oresi were in Lafayette
with a view of ascertaining the
probable support an ice factory
would receive from the people of
this to' in. The (;azette thinks that
the B,tsiness Men's Association
,h.)ould. act upon this matter. The
pronuIl )t and intellig._nt action of
this oiganization was to solve ex
tent instrumental in enlisting the
assistance of the people toward tl'e
refinery and we believe that it can
do as much in the present instance.

MURDERED
By a Band pf Masked Men.
Last Sunday morning . news
reached here that during the night
before a negro named Ovide leli
zare had been killed at his home in
or near the town of Royville. The
news was that a band of masked
men had called at Belizaire's house
in search of a negro named Sou
loque and were fired on by Belizaire
who was subsequently shot and
killed.
Coroner Gladu laft Saturday
morning for Royville in company
with Deputy Sheriff Mouton, Sheriff
Broussard being in Baton Rouge on
business connected with his official
duties. Coroner Gladu swore Jno.
E:. Primeaux, Julien II. David,
Nelson Higginbotham, J. O. Blan
chet and Adam Primeaux as a jury
and proceeded to hold an inquest.
WVe give below the evidence ad
duced at the inquest, which showsI
that a most cowardly and horrible
murder has been .committed.
Jean Tabarlet testified that heso
saw several persons pass on horse
back and about five minutes later
saw them return. He heard the re
ports of about forty pistol shots.
Cilia Burns being sworn, said:
"Last night.I saw some ten or more
persons masked, and on seeing
them I was too frightened to notice
what was going on. I heard shots
from the masked men. I do not
know if my father, Ovide Belizaire,
sh ,t and returned the fire for I was
too excited. I believe he was sit
ting on the bed when he was shot."
Wilson Belizaire said: -'Last
night at about zo o'clock some
twelve men entered my father's
(Ovide Belizaire) house and asked
for Soulouque. My father then
told them that Soulouque was not
there and they could look for him.
They then struck me on the head
with some blunt instrument and
then the firing began. I found the
gun near my father in the yard."
Honore Burns said: "Some I2 to
13 men masked with handkerchiefs
entered Uncle Ovide Belizaire's
house and made inquiries about
Soulouque. Uncle Ovide said Sou
louique was not there and they
could look for him. They (the
masked men) then shot at Ovide
and he returned the fire. After
having been shot he jumped through
the window with his gun in his
hands, and this morning we found
the gun near him."
S-arah ..clizare, wife of the mur
c:. ri lm.nn, gave the same testi
'r w.)y as above.
Corneiius Belizaire said: "Last
r:ai!.t about io o'clock some t2 or
mor e men entered my father's house
and asked for one Soulouque. The
men were masked. My father told
them that Soulouque was not there
and they could look for him. They
then shot my father (Ovide Beli
zaire) and myself in the thigh."
After hearing the evi-ence the
jury rendered the following verdict:
"Said Ovid- Belizaire came to his
death by the hands of unknown
parties who feloniously entered his
house and shot at him inflicting
wounds of which he died."
