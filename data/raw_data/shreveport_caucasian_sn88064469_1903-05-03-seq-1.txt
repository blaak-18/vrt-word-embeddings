1For the Vicksburg, Shreveport any
&?acific Railroad--. Difference Over
a "Scoop" by Rival Papers.
The Caucasian will admit that Ai ha!
no inclination to intermeddle in o* *
interject its views in any controversy o,
difference arising between its contem
poraries, the Times and the Journal
but it can not restrain an expression oi
its enjoyment from the perusal of local
newsy articles, in which the fourna.
announced that the Vicksburg, Shreve
port and Pacific had acquired front the
Shreveport Compress and Warehouse
Company valuable property in the two
blocks bounded by Mdarket, .ake" and
Marshall streets, and the tracks <$ the
Vickslhrg. Shreveport and Pacific, in
cluding the warehouse. preperty of the
company. ~c.. excepting the :nmachinery.
whiclh is te be. removel, and which
statement led the Times, in a figurative
sense, to jump on the Journal with both
feet. The Times not only challenged the
allegations but defied the allegator, who
has met the issue with facts, to which
the Times agrees by the publication of
about the same matter which it an
nounced was incorrect and which led it
to an attempt to paralyze the Journal.
In this controversy there is a central
feature, around which the elements of
discord gravitated, and that element is
Mr. Ford, superintendent of the *icks
burg, Shreveport and Pacific, who when
approached on the subject riot only de
nied defiantly the allegations but was
about to sit dow1 on die allegator. And
now for the sequence which is of gen
eral interest to the public. The facts are
that the Shreveport Warehouse and
Compress Company sole on Friday 4
the Vicksburg. Shreveport and Pacific
Railroad Company the unexpired lease
on the "property and all the lots owned
by the compress company in the two
blocks bounded by Market, Lake, Mar
shall streets and the tracks of the Vicks
burg. Shreveport and Pacific. Included
in the sale is also the warehouse prop
erty of the compress on the east side of
Market street and adjoining the railroad
tracks. The amount paid by the railroad
for this property and for the lease re
ferred to was $67,500. The money was
paid in cash, all the popers transferring
the title were signed up, and it is in
tended that the deed will be offered for
record at the istrict celrk's office this
afternoon."
Which transaction is of record.
The next proposition is speculative.
Of course it could not be expected that
Mr. Ford, who defied the allegator and
denied the allegations, in this case would
admit anything or give the minutest in
formation or even an inkling of the
future, but any man possessing the
brains of a pea fowl will readily con
clude that the Vickburg, Shreveport and
Pacific investment is more significant
than a man "full of prunes.", The last
man on earth to whom--the Caucasian
would ever apply for information is a
"know nothing" or a "know all" con
nected with a railroad or express com
pany or corporation, who, standing on
the dignity of .their position, would, if
they could, "sit down on" the newspaper
man except when he would have "a bou
quet," and whc as a rule soar, in their
own esteem, so far above the common
herd that a man possessing less than a
million or "diked out in tinseled tog
gery" should feel flattered in any con
descension which these self-inflated dig
nitaries would concede in their recog
nition and sometimes circumscribed
civilityj. But it is unfortunate that some
men can not be purchased at their, self
estimated valuation and resold at their
real worth. Indeed there would be a
marked difference such as astounded
and made speechless "Hunlpty I)umpty"
when he tumbled from the wall. But to
the proposition speculative. As alleged,
there may be a depot, a regular passen
ger "dapo" which may cost ,--- , but
being speculative we would hesitate to
name or even intimate the amount.
However, from our point of view we
have enjoyed immeasurably the little
difference in the statements of the two
newspapers, but a fact is a fact, and
nothing on earth' can distort a fact when
applied to logical reasoning and positive
conclusions. The Journal in this in
stance is entitled to the cake, the bou
4uet and the chromo.

S entitled to a special notice of commen
I dation for the completion of a job of
book-binding which had long exercised
I and perplexed the officials of Claiborne
parish, the clerk in `articular, who. to
gether had discussed how to compil
and bind the records, which are invalu
able. so valuable that no money consid
F eration could replace them if lost or de
stroyed by fire. It was when in this
quandary, figuring at one time on the
transportation .to Homer of a bindery
outfit to do this work which could go
longer be delayed, that Mr. O. P. Ogil
vie visited Homer and after a pleasant
interview with the clerk of the court
and other officials of the parish of Clai

execute the work expeditiously and
satisfactorily, and offered such indem
nity bond as would be named, but the
officials well knew, as we have said, that
no amount of money could replace the
records if lost or destroyed. Having the
fullest confidence in the integrity and
the reliability of Mr. O. P. Ogilvie-the
kind of asset which outweighs money
as instanced in this case-the work of
the compilation and binding of these
records was entrusted to Ogilvie
Harper on their honor, a pledge, which I
to gentlemen, should not be forfeited.
even in the face of death. Having been
complimented with this confidence, they
assumed their obligation which has been 1
discharged honorably and satisfactorily,
the last of the records having been
shipped Friday afternoon.
No one can imagine the care and the
attention given these old recdrds, some I
being visibly discolored with age, and
as a safeguard there was always an at
tendant at night, a faithful man, who a
was pledged to not permit a single re
cord to be destroyed in case of fire.

thle requisite essentials, are prepared to
execute expeditiously and in the best
