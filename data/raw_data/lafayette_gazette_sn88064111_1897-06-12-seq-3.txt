PUBLIC OPINION
Redlected in the Papers of this
Great Stsite.
B There are now i8,ooo New York
tailores on a strike, with hourly
prospects of the number being in
creased to 32,ooo. For this condi
tion of affairs the Atlanta Constitu
tion believes the cause may be ex
plained in a very few words. Dur
ing the late campaign, the New
York tailors were given to under
stand that as- soon as the Republi
can party came into power times
would materially improve and
wages increase. On the strength
of these pledges many of them were
induced to vote the Republican
ticket; but instead of realizing the
hopes which they were led to en
tertain before the election, they
have since been required to do ad
ditional work without extra com
pensation. Unable to endure the
situation longer and seeing no re
lief ahead, they decided to strike,
with the results which have just
been noticed. Until the principles
of sound Democracy are restored
to the government there can be no
relief from the burdens under
which the country is now suffering.
-Lake Charles Press, Dem.
There is not a decent man in
Louisiana who will believe that
:Senator McEnery has been actuated
in any vote he has or may cast, by
dishonest or corrupt motives.
There is no Democrat in Louisiana
who is more at variance with Sena
tor McEnery than the editor of the
States. Yet we would pledge our
right arm for his absolute incorrup
tibility. We do not think we will
ever support him for any public
office again. We do not believe he
can ever again claim to be a Demo
ciat, or asp ire to honor or emolu
anents at the hands of the Demo
cratic party. But we are as con
vinced to-day of his absolute and
incorruptible integrity; of the sin
cerity and patriotism of his motives
as we ever were.-Daily States,
D)em.
I~ets see now, how many news
papers in this State will promise
and obligate thenselves to support
no man-no matter what party
who is not morally and politically
honest; and who has not received
his nomination fairly and squarely
by the votes of the legal suffragans
of h s party ? The Progress is will
ing to do this if its breth:en of the
Louisiana Press Association will do
likewise. Come out and show your
colors brethren ! Be either for
honesty and fairness, or corruption
and ring rule. Speak out, how
many will unite wi:h The Progress
on this proposition ? - Shreveport
Progress, Dem.
If the good men of Louisiana
could be taught that there were
great moral responsibilities resting
on them as citizens, political cor
ruption in our State would die an
ignominious death at the next elec
tion.-Shreveport Progress, Dem.
Moss & Mouton are stocking up
extensively while lumber is cheap,
so that their customers at Scott and

benefit of lowest prices.
