in rent, and the burden is so deli
cately distributed that all pay their
part of it, whether they know it or
not.
For it must be true that if I get
an income, somebody, somewhere,
must pay it.
The ones who do not own the
house pay it to the ones who do own
it.
And the people who pay it have no
control over it whatever.
Is that clear to you?
Isn’t that a fact with all property,
no matter what its character, that
produces an income for the owners?
Well, now, suppose that your town
would build such a house, and go
into debt a million, wouldn’t there
be a howl?
But isn’t my building just as much
a debt on you as would be the public
ownership of it, built on bonds?
I would draw an income in the
shape of rent, and the other would
be a smaller income to some one in
the shape of interest, and some time
you would get it paid for, and stop
interest, while if I own it the tax on
you will never stop, but get greater
the more your town grows.
Now, every rented house in your
place, or every house used for busi
ness, is a debt upon you.
The people recognize only as a
debt some public bonds, but all the
income property in the nation is a
public debt upon its people.
The income property of the nation
is something like one hundred bil
lion dollars. The public debts are

great desire for Confederate inde
pendence.
In my inaugural address 1 assert
ed that necessity, not choice, had led
to the secession of the Southern
States; that as an agricultural peo
ple their policy was peace and free
commerce with all the world; that
the constituent parts, not the system
of government, had been changed.
The removal of the troops from
Fortress Moultrie to Fort Sumter,
the guns of which threatened the har
bor of Charleston, and the attempt to
throw re-enforcements into that fort,
thus doubly breaking a pledge that
matters should be kept in statu quo,
constituted the occasion as well as
the justification of the opening of fire
upon Fort Sumter. Speedily follow
ing this event came the call for a
large army by Mr. Lincoln and the
secession of other Southern States as
the consequence of this unmistakable
purpose of coercion.
Virginia, which had led in the ef
fort by a Peace Convention to avert
national ruin, when she saw the Con
stitution disregarded and the pur
pose to compel free States by mili
tary force to -submit to arbitrary
power, passed an Ordinance of Seces
sion and joined the Confederate
States.
Shortly after this, as authorized by
the Provisional Congress, I removed
the Confederate capital from Mont
gomery to Richmond.
Among the many indications of
good will shown when on my way to,
and after my arrival at, Richmond
was the purchase of a very fine resi
dence in Richmond by leading citi
zens. It was offered as a present;
only four billions. But one is just
as much a debt as the other, so the
income property is a debt upon the
people twenty-five times greater than
the public or bonded debt.
So we are slaves whether the debt
is an income debt, privately owned,
or a bonded debt.
Every building built for income is
an addition to this debt for you and
your children to pay.
The richer becomes the nation, the
greater becomes the debt upon you
and your posterity.
The income on this property is
greater than the net income of the
nation, and hence the property now
held by the many is fast going into
the hands of the few to pay this in
creasing income.
The total annual interest on the
public debt of the Government is
about twenty million.
But you pay Rockefeller seventy
million a year profit on oil, and think
you are not in debt.
You see, Rockefeller is nearly four
times as great a debt to you as the
obligations of your government.
And the same is true of every oth
er industry that you do not own.
How is that for a skin game?
How can you and your posterity
escape the damnation of slavery?
If you can get that into your head
clearly you will never be deceived
by any political haranguer. You will
know the truth —and the Bible says,
“The truth shall make you free.”

but. following a rule that had gov
erned my action in all such cases, I
declined to accept it. I continued to
live in Richmond until the Confeder
ate forces were compelled to with
draw from the defenses of the capi
tal.
That event was not quite unex
pected, but it occurred before the
conditions were fulfilled under which
General Lee contemplated retreat.
After General Lee was forced to sur
render and General Johnston consent
ed to do so, I started with a very few
of the men who volunteered to ac
company me for the Trans-Mississip
pi; but, bearing on the road that ma
rauders were pursuing my family,
whom 1 had not seen since they left
Richmond, but knew to be enroute
to the Florida coast, I changed my
direction, and after a long and hard
ride found them encamped and
threatened by a robbing party. To
give them the needed protection, I
traveled with them for several days
until in the neighborhood of Trvin
ville, Ga., when 1 supposed 1 could
safely leave them. But. hearing
about nightfall that a party of ma
rauders were to attack the camp that
night, and supposing them to be pil
laging deserters from both armies
and that the Confederates would lis
ten to me, I awaited their coming,
lay down in my traveling clothes, and
fell asleep. Late in the night my col
ored coachman aroused me with the
intelligence that the camp was at
tacked, and I stepped out of the tent
where my wife and children were
sleeping and saw at once that the as
sailants were troops deploying around
the encampment. I so informed my
“Gfyi Jeffersonian
wife, who urged me to escape. After
some hesitation I consented, and a
servant woman started with me, car
rying a bucket as if going to the
spring for water. One of the sur
rounding troops ordered me to halt
and demanded my surrender. I ad
vanced toward the trooper, throwing
off a shawl which my wife had put
over my shoulders. The trooper
aimed his carbine, when my wife,
who witnessed the act, rushed for
ward and threw her arms around me,
thus defeating my intention, which
was, if the trooper missed his aim,
to try to unhorse him and escape
with his horse. Then with every
species of petty pillage and offensive
exhibition I was taken from point to
point until incarcerated in Fortress
Monroe. There I was imprisoned for
two years before being allowed the
privilege of writ of habeas corpus.
At length when the writ was to be
issued the condition was imposed by
the Federal Executive that there
should be bondsmen influential in the
“Republican” party of the North,
Mr. Greeley being specially named.
Entirely as a matter of justice and
legal right, not from motives of per
sonal regard, Mr. Greeley, Mr. Gerrit
Smith, and other eminent Northern
citizens, went on my bond.
In May, 1867, after being released
from Fortress Monroe, I went to
Canada, where my older children
were with their grandmother, my
wife as soon as permitted having
shared my imprisonment and brought
our infant daughter with her. From
time to time I obeyed summonses to
go before the Federal Court at Rich
mond, until finally the case was
heard by Chief Justice Chase and
District Judge Underwood, who were
divided in opinion, which sent the
case to the Supreme Court of the
United States, and the proceedings
were quashed, leaving me without
the opportunity to vindicate myself
before the highest Federal Court.
After about a year’s residence in
Canada, I went to England with my
family under an arrangement that I

was to have sixty days’ notice when
ever the United States Court required
my presence. After being abroad in
England and on the Continent about
a year, I received the offer of an ap
pointment as president of a life in
surance company. Thereupon I re
turned to this country, and went to
Memphis and took charge of the com
pany. Subsequently I came to the
Gulf Coast of Mississippi as a quiet
place where I could prepare my work
on “The Rise and Fall of the Confed
erate Government.” A friend from
her infancy, Mrs. Dorsey shared her
home with me, and subsequently sold
to me her property of Beauvoir, an
estate of five or six hundred acres,
about midway between Mobile and
New Orleans. Before I had fully
paid for this estate, Mrs. Dorsey died,
leaving me her sole legatee. From
the spring of 1876 to the autumn of
1879 I devoted myself to the produc
tion of the historical work just men
tioned.
Since settling at Beauvoir I have
persistently refused to take any active
part in politics, not merely because
of my disfranchisement, but from a
belief that such labors could not be
made to conduce to the public good,
owing to the sectional hostilities
manifested against me since the war.
For the same reason I have also re
fused to be a candidate for public of
fice, although it is well known that I
could at any time have been re-elect
ed a Senator of the United States.
I have been twice married, the sec
ond time being in 1844 to a daughter
of William B. Howell, of Natchez, a
son of Governor Howell, of New Jer
sey. She has borne me six children
—four sons and two daughters. My
sons are all dead; my daughters sur
vive. The elder is Mrs. Hayes, of
Colorado Springs, Colo., and the
mother of four children. My young
est daughter lives with us at Beau
voir, Miss. Born in the last year of
the war, she became familiarly
known as the “Daughter of the Con
federacy.”—Copied from the Confed
erate Veteran.
