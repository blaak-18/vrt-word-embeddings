read as follows:

Our Nominee. -
If Captain Pharr is gaining o
friends throughout the State as P
rapidly as he has in this vicinity hi
there can be no doubt as to result P
of the election. Men who have q
Ibeen Democrats all their lives re- .
cognize that a change is necessary pI
in our affairs of State, that cor
ruption has held sway long enough.
SThey see in Captain Pharr an hon
est man who has nothing but the
good of the people at beart. A
- gentleman who will if ele. ted have i
the laws enforced, and that justice ý
shall be meted out to the rich and i
poor alike. He has nothing sel- e
fish about him, nothing to desire ii
for self. With him as Governor h
Louisiana will flourish as she has
never done before.-Morgan City h

State Platform
People's Party of Louisiana.
1. We affirm our allegiance to
the pure principles of popular Qov
ernment, as enunciated by Wash
ington, Jefferson and Jackson, and
embodied in our National platform,
and we uphold the principle em
bodied in the immortal declaration
that this should be "a Government
of the people, by the people and
for the people."
2. And especially do we de
mand the free and unlimited coin
age of both gold and silver, at the
ratio of 16 to 1, with equal debt
paying power as primary money,
and a full legal tender monetary
system for the people of the Unit
ed Stated, without consulting any
foreign nation or money syndicate.
3. We demand for Louisiana we
industries equal protection to that 'n
afforded the industries of other
States. An American, not a Brit- E
ish system of commercial laws,
that no discrimination against our
agricultural and industrial classes
may be made.
4. We favor a just and liberal
system of public schools for the
benefit of all classes of our people,
and we deplore the fact that for
many years the management of
our public school system has boon T
so defective that the party now in
power seeks to disfranchise a large
number of our citizens on the
grounds of ignorance.
5. We denounce the disgrace- A
ful and infamous election frauds
- which have prevailed in Louisiana,
and we demand and are determin
ed to have a perfectly honest and
Y fair election, at which each citizen
I qualified to vote, shall cast his bal
lot freely and secretly, and the
! vote shall be fairly counted as they
Sare actually cast. This is the su
- preme issue in this campaign, and
in -its success the honor, manhood
and prosperity of Louisiana are 1
° involved. The foul and loathsome
° methods which have brought the
t ballot box stuffer to the front, and
° placed him in power in Louisiana,
must, in the name of liberty jus
tice, morality and common decen
cy, be suppressed.
6. We oppose and denounce the F
proposed suffrageamendment, con
g cocted by political schemers, not to
s purify and elevate the ballot box
y but to subserve their selfish pur
it poes by providing contradictory
qualifications, to suddenly difran
e chise large masses of worthy citi
z ens, by deluding the people with
y romises of changes i the next
S egislature. We denounce the
whole amendment as a vicious
fraud which proposes measures and
'- methods that are un-American and
Sdestructive of free institutions.
A 7. We favor the utmost eoono- ]
re my of expenditures, in State, city
and parish, and pledge our candi
d ates to a strict and impartial en
d forcement of all laws, and the pres
I- ervation and promotion of every
re interest in Louisiana, whose wel
fr fare is broader and more sacred
than party lines or partisan poli
cies; and we invite and urge the
ty true men and honest citizens of (
oisiana, without regard to past
party affiliations to join with us in
a noble, patriotic and powerful ef
fort to relieve our people and to
elevate the standard of polities
re nl public morality in our beloved
in State.
