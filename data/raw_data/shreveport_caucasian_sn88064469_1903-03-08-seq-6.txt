SPE(IAL SESSION ISON
Called to Order at Noos Thursday
by Mr. Frye.
SENATORS SWORN IN.
Twenty-Six of em Enter on Theit
Term of Six Years, Among Themj I
Bcing the Much Discussed
Smoot of Utah.
Washington, March 6.-The' United
States senate at noon Thursday met
in special session called by the pres
ident. It was an interesting event, as
such sessions do not usually occur ex
cept when a president of the United
States is inducted into office, at the be
ginning of each new congress, and this
was the first session of the senate ol
the Fifty-eighth congress. The oath
was administered to twenty-six sena
tors, who take office for six years.
The senate being a continuous body
its officers hold until their successors
are chosen, so promptly at noon the
body was called to order by President
pro tem Frye. The scene was a bril
liant one and not unlike the opening
of every cession of congress. The gal
leries were filled at an early hour and
in the family and reserved galleries
were friends and relatives of the new
senators. The desks of the new sen
ators could be distinguished by the
wealth of flowers which had been pro
vided. The lavishness of the admirers
was shown by the fact that desks and
even chairs In some instances were
completely buried under huge floral
eisLes and hoan utihl .ha,.na*
After the invocation Mr. Bennett,
the secretary of the senate, read the
proclamation of the president conven
ing the senate in extra session..
The names of the newly elected sen
ators were called alphabetically, and
each was escorted to the desk by his
colleague. As soon as the names were
called there was applause In the gal
leries. That given to Mr. Gorman was
especially noticeable.
It is the custom, to rebuke appause In
the galleries, but Mr. Frye, the presi
dent pro tem, overlooked the demon
stration.
"The chair," said he, "is especially
lenient to the galleries this morning,"
and then be received a round of ap
plause.
Messrs. Spooner and Allison receiv
ed generous applause as they were es
corted to the desk.
Mr. Smoot of Utah su-bscribed to the
oath with an emphatic "I do." No ob
Section was made to his ,taking the
oath.

SHOT STEPDAUGHTER.
Melton When Wounds Mrs. Culver and
Takes His Own Life.
Henderson, Ky., March 6.-Allen
Melton, a well-to-do farmer, who Wed
nesday night fatally wounded his step
daughter and shot Mrs. John dulver,
committed suicide Thursday in a
barn when he found the building sur
rounded by bloodhounds which had
been sent in pursuit of him. Melton
Wednesday night went to the home of
John Culver, where his step-daughter,
Mary Melton, sixteen years old, was
spending the night. Culver was away
from the house. Melton entered and,
seeing his step-daughter, drew a re
volver and fired two shots at her. Mrs.
Culver ran into the room and Melton
fired, the ball passing through her
lungs. He went to home of Dr. Lat

all night. Early Thursday morning he
went home and Morganfield's blood
hounds trailed him to a barn. When

large amount of paris green and then
shot himself through the head, falling
dead. Two weeks ago, it is said, he
tried to hang his divorced wife, and

LEGAL BATTLE.
This Is -the Course the Wabash Katter
Seems to Be Assuming.
St. Louis, March 6.-The Wabash
strike situation is resolving itself into
a legal battle for dissolution of in
Junction granted by Judge Adams. At
torneys for the firemen and trainmen
are still at work on affidavits to be
filed in the court showing why the
injunction should not be made perma
nent. The possibility of the firemen
and trainmen of the Wabash striking
as individuals without waiting for the
word from their leaders is now being
discussed. It is stated that men are
ready to go out at a moment's notice.
Unless President Ramsey yields it
is further declared that engineers,
conductors, telegraphers, brakemen
and trackmen to the number of 50,000
may become involved in the struggle.
Rumors of secret compact between the
men and leaders to go out even if the
dissolution of Judge Adams' injunction
is not granted, are abundant.
ON GUARD.

Non-Union Men.
Colorado Springs, Colo., March 6.

mills and there has been a clash with
strikers. The city appointed a com

is working. Brigadier General Chase
sent a Gatling gun section and infan
try men to tell Uride, upon receipt of
an affidavit, that attack had been
made by strikers' orders to oust em
ployees and gain possession of the
property.
PLACES FILLED.
Two Important Appointments for the De.
partment of Justice.
Washington, March 6.-Two impor
tant appointments in the department
of Justice were agreed upon by Presi
dent Roosevelt and Attorney General
Knox. William A. Day of the District
of Columbia is made to be assistant
attorney to the attorney general at a
salary of $7000 a year and Milton D.
Purdy of Minnesota is to be assistant
attorney general. Mr. Day has been
for a long time attorney for the inter
state commerce commission and Mr.
Purdy is a prominent lawyer of St.
Paul. He-was formerly assistant Unit
ed States district attorney of Minne
sota. These places were created by
a recent act of congress.
Gamlna at Moete Carlo.
Sir Hiram Maxim has been investi
gating Monte Carlo. Quoting the words
of M. Blanc, the organizer of the bank,
"rouge gague quelque-fois, noir son
vent, mats blanc toujours," he says that
in the long run the best of systems can
do little more than reduce the loss
which is eventually inevitable owing to
the heavy percentage in favor of the
bank. The official guidebooks of Mon
te Carlo represent the average relations
between the bank and the player as
about sixty-one to sixty and that the
annual winnings of the bank are about
$5,000,000. This would indicate that
about $185,000,000 was taken to the
bank every year and $180,000,000 won
back from the bank. Sir Hiram was
naturally staggered by the magnitude
of these figures and looked into the
matter. He concluded that the amount
staked each year was about $5,500,000
and that the bank, instead of winning
the guidebook's 1% per cent, kept about
90 per cent of the money. In other
words, the chances against the player
coming out even are about ten to one.
Venes.ela.
Venezuela has a larger area than the
combined areas of the great states of
Texas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma and
Arkansas. In figures its area amounts
to about 590,000 square miles. The
population is 500,000 less than that of
Massachusetts. In 1891 it was 2,323,
527. The capital, Caracas, ias 75,000
inhabitants, Maracaibo 35,000, La
Guayra'15,000 and Barcelona about 13,
000. About one person out of every
hundred is pure white, while the oth
ers are descendants of black slaves,
mulattoes, etc., and Indians.
The republic has three zones - hot,
temperate and cool-according to the
elevation of the land. The lowlands in
the northwest are very torrid. Here
great quantities of coffee and cacao are
raised, which form the largest agricul
tural exports of the country. The ca
cao is sent mainly to France, Germany
and Spain and the coffee, which aver
ages a yearly crop of 55,000 tons, to the
United States. - National Geographic

Would Not Sell a Napoleonic Relcl.
Mme. Napoleon Ney, widow of the
late Napoleon Ney, who was one of the
committee of Frenchmen se'nt to the
United States to present the statue of
liberty to the sister republic, has been
offered a fabulous sum for a unique
Ney-Napoleonic relic.
It Is the official document issued by
the second republic rehabilitating the
memory of the great Marshal Ney. He
was the grandfather of Mme. Ney's
husband.
Marshal Ney was shot after the bat
tle of Waterloo, when the English and
Prussians held Paris and brought back
Louis XVIII.
He was shot because Louis sent him
out to capture Napoleon when return
ing from Elba, and instead of trying to
capture he embraced his old leader.
ine. Ney refuses all offers for the,
preous document, for it was the wish
of her ababd that it shouald be left to

*o matter where theireomeeaPlng*
to be or where they pass othe seasons
of the year, most popular authors
spend a large part of the winter af
New York. Thomas Nelson Page is am
exception. He is rarely seen here. o)
his winter home is in Washington.
Mr. Page has made a fortune Irom
his books. He married Mrs. Field, the
widow of Mr. Leiter's partner, who is
also possessed of very great wealth.
Their home is one of the &hrgest and
finest at the capital, and both Mr.
Page and his wife, being tond of gay
ety, entertain frequently. Their din
ners are noted not only for the menus,
which are prepared with taste and
judgment, but for the bright people
one is'sure to meet at their mahogany.
The Page lining room is extremely
handsome, and the living rooms are so
homelike and attractive that a noted
clubman said he disliked ever to go
there, for it pained him to come away.
Mr. Page is the president of the Chevy
Chase club, which is devoted to hunt
ing and outdoor sport, and a fading
spirit in the Metropolitan club.
The editor of the reformed.anE Haa
perized Metropolitan Magazine, Mr.
John Kendrick Bangs, like the rest of
humanity, suffers occasionally from the
vagaries of parlor maids. Not long ago
it was decided that his library shelves
should be thoroughly dusted. Accord
ingly the books were carefully removed.
Now, Mr. Bangs had a grandfather
who wrote quite as voluminously as
himself, though upon a rather more re
ligious range of subjects. All these pi
ous volumes had been carefully and re
spectfully segregated: Mr. Bangs sup
posed they always would be.
But he had failed to reckon with the
agency of the parlor maid. When he
next entered his library, he was pained
to observe his grandfather's volume of
"Letters on Sanctification" standing
shoulder to shoulder with his own
"Houseboat on the Styx."
Mr. Bangs is said to have murmured,
"And the sins of the children shall be
visited upon the fathers."
Miss Beatrice Harraden in a recent
interview makes some rather interest
ing revelations of her methods of work.
She could not, she says, write with oth
er people around her, so she retires in
the morning to a studio standing in a
delightful old garden. Here she com
poses her story. Two hours of steady
labor is all she requires of herself at
one sitting. She recognizes that some
may consider she escapes rather easily,
but she says she has a way of thinking
'out her stories beforehand, so that the
actual writing is done very swiftly,
without hesitation, and at the end of
the two hours she has produced a con
siderable quantity of work. She points
out also that with all her facility she
has not been prolific and speaks of hav
ing spent five years on one book.
