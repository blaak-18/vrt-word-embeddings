The Road to Breaux Bridge.
Ve learn from the Valley of the

this town and Breaux Bridge is now
completed, the contractor having
finishe' work last Wednesday.
This road considerably shortens the
route to our sister town and it is
with much pleasure that the news
of its completion will be received
by our people. As it seems that
we cannot have railway commnuni
cation with our neighbors, let us, at
least, make the route overland as
short as possible, and it is of mnu
tual interest that it be always kept
in good traveling condition. 7 he
people of Breaux Bridge and Lafa
yette have always been on friendly
terms and it is to be hoped that the
same brotherly feeling will continue
to exist. During the last two or
three years a large number of fami
lies from Breaux Bridge have moved
to Lafayette, and now form part of
our population. By curtailing the
distance between the two towns,
cultivating a spirit of goodfelloar
ship, encouraging commercial inter
course and adding i', every possible
way to the already friendly relations
much good will be sure to follow.

A Monkey on the Wlarpath.
Quite a commotion was caused in ,
the neighborhood of the Catholic
church last Wednesday by the ap
pearance of the monkey which is I
kept caged up at the presbytery.
I t seems that this much spoken-of
animal escaped from his cage and 1
male things decidedly lively in that!1
usually quiet section of the town.
A swell colored marriage was about I
to be solemnized and the news that j
the monkey was out soon spread
terror among the attendants, the
the feminine portion of the assem
bly making desperate efforts to make
themselves as scarce as possible.
It would seem that this monkey en
joys a very unenviable reputation,
if we are to judge from the warlike
demonstrations that his escape ap
pears to have occasioned. It is in
the neighborhood where be is best
known that this feeling seems to
prevail. Whether this enmity is
based merely on prejudice, or not,
he is regarded with suspicion by
his closest neighbors, some of whom
told The Gazette man that had he
given them an opportunity he would
have been severely dealt with. Af
ter surveying the grounds around
the church and frightening the wo
men and children, sonime one sicked
the dogs at him. He is very much
afraid of the dogs and got out of
their reach in less time than it takes
to say Jack Robertson. He next
gave his attention to two children
of MIr. MIayfiell who were playing
in front of their home. We are in
formed that one of the children was
either bitten or scratched -Tbout
the back by the monkey. Needless
to say that the little ones were nat
urally much affected, though the
wound is not painful. The faithful
dog was again brought into service
and Mr. MIonkey made a straight 1
shoot for his cage for protection.
It is to be hoped that those ini
charge of this monkey will not allow
himn to escape in the future. He is
not only a positive nuisance but he
is absolutely dangerous. Just as
well have any otiher wild beast roam
at larbe as to let this vicious brute
terrorize won-en and children.

S nlec Good Work.
A\t i t o'clock Saturday night TMr.
Alcide Ilegnautl called upon Sheriff
Broussard anti informed him that
a:t about 8:30 o'clock the same
nighlt, while on tlhe publlic road near
Scott and eaccefully going to his
home, he was shot at by one of a
gang of negroes who were coming
toward Iafayette. Mr. legueaud
related tliat hel was positive theyc
were negroes. but he could nrot
identify any of tlhem. lie met
them near Sott. awl.. Icinr i aa
the negroes, who were in two gigs,
ample room to pass. It seemed to
SMr. BLegnaud, however, that one of
the horses was bring driven directly
toward his buggy. -ce cricel aloud,
'Hold on !" in order to avoid a
collision. Thereupon, one of the
negroes drew a revolver and fired
at him, causing his horse to become
frightened and unmanageable, mak
ing pursuit impossible.
Sheriff Broussard, Danton Vea
zey and Hebert Biliaud, acting up
on this information, started in pur
suit of the culprits. When it is
considered that Mr. Begnaud had
failed to recognize anyone, and that
the shooting occurred early in the
night, the task of the sheriff to ar
rest the right parties was an under
takin.4 which required no small
amount of energy and considerable
detective skill. But, with that us
ual dauntless spirit which has al
ways characterized "'Ike" and made
him a terror to evil-doers through
out Southwest Louisiana, he and
his deputies went to the spot where
the shooting took place and waited
there, in the hope that the negroes
who had done the shooting would
return that way to their homes dur
ing the night.
At about 3 o'clock in the morn
ing the sheriff spied a negro coming
up the road. He placed him under
arrest and proceeded to question
him. It was learned from him that
during that day there had been a
game of base ball played at Duson,
and that some parties from Lafa
yette had gone there in gigs.
Among the party he mentioned the
names of Joe Andrus, Joe Cheva
lier and two Derousselle boys. The
sheriff's long experience with the
criminal classes of this parish served I
him well in this case. He imme
diately came to the conclusion that
Joe Andrus was the man he wanted,
but as a precautionary measure he
first located the Derousselle boys.
They denied having shot any one,
but told the sheriff that they knew i
something about the shooting.
They made a statement which cor
roborated with that of Mr. Beg
naud, and said that they rode in a
gig; that immedir, tely behind them
waos Joe Andrus and Joe Chevalier,
driving in a gig, and that one of
th:em dli the shooting. In answecr
to a iqujStioin from the sheriff, t:;ey
sa:tid it was the one seated on tihe
ri; ;t sitle of the gig who had fired t
the s:!ot. A1ndrus and Chevalier
were later located, and it was ascer
tained that the former was the one
,z lat on the right side and drove.
c:hevni.r gave the whole thing
away, and said that Joe Andrus was
ihi;. comnainion in the gig and was
tic I nc wiho had done the shooting.
Bloth were charged with complicityt
in the ciinme, and the Derousselle
boys were released.
W\e complimenti Sheriff Broussard
upon this fine piece of work. At
iI o'clock he heard of the shootng
and started out without a single 1
clue, and at daylight he had his 1
game behind the bars, peacefully
meditating upon a gloomy future.
-Creole-American.
The grand jury having been dis
charged District Attorney Gordy
filed a bill of information against
Andrus who was tried by a jury
Wednesday and convicted. An
drus is considered a bad character.
Judge Allen sentenced him to two
years in the penitentiary.

The year's cotton crop has been
raised on a 4. cent basis, :he farmer
has been taught the lesson of his
life, and he should rejoice. This
section of the parish of Lafayette
was sorely crippled last fall as the
disastrously low prices weighed
heavily on seven-eights of our farm
ers who were unable to settle their
debts. The spring af 2895 will also
be long remembered, as fuel was
added to the burning embers, by
the refusal of the merchants to ad
vance food and clothing to the
farmers, after having "swiped" in
all the crop of '94. Does there not
exist sonime gratitude for an honest
man who has toiled the whole year
and who falls a victim to circum
stances? Many a farrmecr was given tihe
umost unsympathetic "No" a man can
tell a another. 'The only excuse the
merlichant gave was that he was in
Sfavor of killing the ''credit system."
None desired thie abolishment of
the credit syse l: more than
"Cherokee," buit hIe believed that
othel; than the "(Crushing System"
should ihave been doptetl. It is in
de ed fortunate that our people are
-ndov1 d with undaunted courage,
a' there is no telling what they
would ihave siuffTrcl. Now, a word
to the farmers. Bic careful as it is
easy to - rimis,- the meaning of the
'1,- ",' - e(:. ',[ -,. c . 1 ,, . ,e 
is baited. Your crops are short,
but they are bringing very good
prices and you will easily pay the
little bal ince due since last year,
and some hard-earned dollars will
be left you. Bear in mind that
those dollars were made under
trying circumstances, and by re
membering the stigma cast upon
you at the beginning of this year,
you will not be baited nor will you
be lured. Farmers, it is now in
your power to slaughter this credit
system, but then kill it humanely,
and in a manner worthy of an hon
est farmer.

There is one medicine which
every family should be provided
with. VWe refer to Chamberlain's
Pain Balm. WVhen it is kept at
hand the severe pain of a burn or e
scald may be promptly relieved and r
the sore healed in Iluchl less time
than when medicine has to be sent i
for. A sprain may be promptly c
treated hefore inflammation sets in,
which insures a cure in about one
third the time otherwise required.
Cuts and bruises should receive inn
mediate attention, before the parts
become swollen, and when Cham
berlain's Pain Balm is applihcd it
will heal them without matter being
formed, and without leaving a scar. t
A sore throat may be cured in one
night. A piece of flannel dam
pened with this liniment and bound
over the seat of pain, will cure
lame back or pain in the side or
chest in tweniy-four hours. It is
the most valuable, however, for
rheumatism. Persons afflicted with
this disease will be delighted with
the prompt relief from pain which
it affords, and it can be depended
upon to effect a complete cure.

never tires, says the Canton Press.
A father may turn his back upon
his child, brothers and sisters may
become inveterate enemies, husbands
may desert their wives, wives their
husbands, but a mother's love en
dure's through all; in good repute,
in bad repute, in the face of the
world's condemnation, a mother
still lives on and hopes her child
may turn from Its evil ways and
repent ; still she remembers
the infant smiles that filled her
heart with raptux e, the merry laugh,
the joyful shouts of his childhood,
the opening promises of his youth;
and she can never be brought to
think him unworthy.
