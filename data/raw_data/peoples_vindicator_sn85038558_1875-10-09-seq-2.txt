The issue of the Shreveport Tiles
of the 24I Oct', ,er contains a remiark
able correspondenCe, to say the least
,f 1i, betwen Marshal Packard,
Chairman of the RIadical State Ccn
tral Cormmlnittee, and A. ! . Leonard,
Esq., of Shlumveport. lWe are struck,
first with the pitiable condition, to
which P'acka;d and his crew are rI,
dtleed, to have called forth such a
whining appeal from him, so lately
lord of all h'i surveyed--the holder
of Empleror Grant's great seal in
louisiana-thle chief head in viola
l;otions of constitutional freedom and
distriction of civil liberty, as well
as all the traditions of tfie Republic
that lihe should cry out like Ctasar,
huffletiln, the Tyher: "'Ih.lp me Cs
sius or' I sink," muist have been in
dnuced by some mighty calamity
in the prospective, disturbing the
mind of the head and front of Radical
offenlin gin Louisianna.
The chairman of the Central lladi
cal Committee of this State, the
highest authority we can quote, has
admitted the fact, which we have
charged upon his party for the past
eight years, of its . utter inability to
bring about reform, the moral degra
dation of its leaders and the rotten
ness of the whole structtue. How
does this sound in the cars of the
"small fry" press of the State? We
think they will, with haste, denuunce
Mr. Packard's statements as false.
What means this ap1peal to the
Whig, Conservative and Liberal le
ment of the white vote of Louisiana ?I
And who aie they, and what are they f
'Thalt Mir. P'ackardtl should say scli
things of them as, that they do not
like joiiung in with the Democratic
party to save the State.-from .just
such a future as the past ACTS, in tihe
openi fae of dcclarations,.as Mr. Pack
ard and his party are responsible for.
Are the Whig, Liberal and Conser
vative elements, granting there are
such here for sake of argument, any
more virtuous, any more intelligent,
than those of New York, Massachu
setts or other Northern States I Not
one whit, and the Northern wing has
gone to the Democratic party, the
only Constitutional party in this
Union, with the hope of saving the
country from the ruin which must
surely follow a continuance in power
of those whom Mr. Packard repre
sents. The Liberal element, to whom
this christian Chairman so feelingly
appeals, are in this State what they
are elsewhere outside the Democrat
ic party at this late day, "office
seekers," who, under the thin guise
of those men of wisdom that Hamlet
describes, answer queries with "pro
found nods," are attempting to make
silence a virtue, that "good may
come of it"-to them. We pub
licly declare, and that to witllout
fear of contradiction--that the man
who has no words of denuncia
tion for the Radicals of the Union
-for tihe carpet, bag-scalawag gov
ernments South, and particularly
his own State, Louisiana-is as vile
as thie vilest of the radicals, aud a
more dangerous man to us, as a peo
ple, than all the open foes in the
State, from Packard down to the
mneanest viper who does his biddilg.
They are the wolves in sheep's cloth
ing-the lired assassins of radicalism
-that stab to the heart their counntry
men under the sacred name of friend
ship for theircause-they are cowards
all, who, as the vultures of the bat
tie field, eat what brave men slay
they hang like the whining begger
upon the outskirts of the armies to
pick up, under the name of Con
servatism, what spoils may be gained
in the fray. Show us a Liberal or a
Conservative, or a Whig in Louisiana,
who ,has no word of condemnation for
Kellogg, Packard, and their past acts
and government, and we will show
you a traitor in disguise, a Judas
ready for .the opportunity to sell his
people for price, else already count
ing his value obtainled, at the sacrifice
of honor and principle.
Packard shows tile weakness of his
plarty by' this whining letter; ihe
shows to the world that our ;charges
have been true; lie stands himself
selfconvicted before the bar of pub
lic opinion-he pleads guilty to the
indietment found against him by the
wllite people, for him and his party,
-nd has tlhe cool assumption to ask
us to reprove the robber by approv
ing the robbery-asks us to overcome
error by ceasing to combat it, that by
truckling to men of base motives;
men in whom no confidence can be
reposed, we subject our honor to
a trembling fear, give up true man
hood and honest principles, to secure
an end already wtithh our owa accom
plishmentl--that lie and his party may
claim virtt for anets which it was in
their power to commit for the past
eight years.
Why this sudden repentance t Is
it not because weak and trembling,
covered with guilt like leprosy from
crown of head to sole of foot-it' ap
proaches the death-bed and blubber
ingly exclaimse, peccavi, with the hope
of forgiveness-with a hlope of an op
portunity being vouchsafed it, to bring
about a recurrence of those same- sins.
No death-bed repentance for us-let
it rather lid 'as the Celt, when lihe
doused the Jew in the British Chan
ael until he abjured Jndenism, and
thlen drowned hiim, that he might not
perjure his sodl by recanting christi
\anity--let the. Packard party be killed
Upon the moiwnt of its confession-
let it die in the hour of its repncutance
and then, if not forgetting, we can
forgive its past-bu;t to hope for a
longer lease of power.under any form,
is ut:erly--nutterly impossible.
It is useless for MIr. l'ackaid to "drop
lines" to Mr. Leonard or any one else
--11r. Leonard is our ftiiend, but lihe
represents no one but Mr. Leonard
should lie join cause with Packard,
or airy of that ilk. We never can be
brought to admit that our own race
and color-the proud conquering Caun
casian, is not superior in virtue to all
others. We will not, by word or
deed, infer that the people, the white
people, ar , not more capable of re
form, of oI,.nest government, than all
the negroes from Virginia to Texas,
headed by all the Carpet-baggers,
and Scalawags in the Iliion,
however much MJr. Leonard may
desire their co-operation. Hle and
all men of his virtue, will find
among his own elan and race, a peo
ple well capable and willingly anxious
to redeem our ibloved State, without
wandering to the army of our con
querers for the sake of an unsub)stan
cial Ipolicy--which can work lno good,
save to the time-server. The whole
demand is fior life, life that they maay
continue to plunder, murder and out
rage us-shall we grant it ? Forbid
it Heaven.
The Ilomer Iliad after a scathing
denunciation of the Conservative
Democracy placidly proposes to heal
the breach after the following style:
The whole qunestion thus resolves
itself into the haind of the individual
ulenlbers of the D)emocratic party
who are truly conservativ-e, and who
are not in favor of murdering men for
a political difft recice of opinion; and
who, on aetcount of their ability and
good character, can wield a most
wholesome balance of power--hoth
as to their own party, and the 1Repib
lican patty also. Surely there may
be found sullficient honor and tolera
tion and incorruptibility in the two
parties to save the State trom such
continued disgrace and ruil as we
have long been lingering under. And
in looking around through the Dem
ocratic ranks for an assisting element
of this sort, public attention and hope
are naturally attracted to such names
as those of Hon. J. J . Eustis, Judge
J. B. .Elam, Gen. John Young, Hon.
J. C. Moneure, Col. John S. Young
and we will add the name of Senator
A. B. George ; for which all his sup
posed ultraism, we will not believe
that his personal honor and individ
nal integrity could be found at tault
on an issue of this sort, or on any
other issue when the test is fairly and
squarely and tangibly made.
What say you gentlemen I Shall
we have peace or war ? Shall we
have a rule of law and order, with
prosperity; or shall we have contin
ned uncertainty and languishinug,
with occasional murder and assas
sination for opinions sake ' Shall
the majority rule paeceably at the
polls, or shalltthle turbulent minority
rule by means of the bhludgeon andl
the assassin,'s dagger and bullet
'"We pause for a reply !" anud we do
not care if you '"all speak at once !"
And thiis too, in the Mansfield Report,
er, which did not reply. Well, we
propose to "speak ours out." If the
rule of "law and order" is to come by
our tamely submitting to the rule of
the negro headed by Blackburn, or
any of the men he names and calls for,
we say wAR!
The article is one that implies a
threat and we candidly call upon the
Homer Iliad and its clan to do their
worst. We have yielded sufficiently
to the unreasonable demands of thle
negroes and we propose to "stop
short" now, No one has -yet been\
killed for "opinions sake" in this see
tioD, bat we believe that many de
served it for utterances and acts which
they claimed as their opinions, and
its followings.
Ten sheep is no majority to a lion,
and the wealth, virtue and iutelli
gence of Lonsiana have stood the tax
ation, rule and legislation of the ig
norantand vicious as long as they
intend to, and we are constraiued to
enquire, what Mr. Homer Iliad is
"going to do about it."

Louisiana, in her present down
trodtlhn contdition, presents a pieture
that calls a throb of sympathetic feel
ing in the hearts of tihe lovers of
freedom and constitutional lilwrtty
from evecry state in the Ulnion. 'That
this is so, the elections of last fall
and those held this year amply testi

and we can congr'atulate ourselves
upon having at last awakened a sence
of justice towards the South, in the
hearts of the Northern i,ople.
Robbled of every.jight at the bayo

most insatiate set of thieving seoun

Is it inot enough to call forth the
energies, the will and mind of every

fion the cursed thr:ildom ! What a
spectacle of virtuous self-denial have
we presented for the past eight long
and gloomy years. What great for
titude and forbearance have we not
summoned to our aid, that we might
not rise in our might to vindicate our
rights as a people, and assert the
great birth right .of resisting the ty
ranical oppgission of the vandals who
have ruled us with a rod of iron; and
have we not sunbmitted like cravens,
withont a show of resistance. What
has been our reasons for thus snbmnit

But, my countrymen, do we do our

not somne hidden spring that prompts
our action l Do we go into the con
test for the salvation of our homes
and firesides, for our wives and little

Far be it from us to doubt the mo

questionably conceive that of the ma
jority to be pure ; but,-we must say
tihe acts of many belie their protesta

that "small still voice" within them,

grand, a glorious opportunity, is now
presented to repeat the undying his

their country and its people I Have
we such among lthe sons of Louisiana ?
Has she no child born from the womb
of these stirring events; sprung rea

Ihead of Jove, to do battle and achieve
victory for her? Those grand old
days tlhat gave birth to heroes, have
not certainly past, and we feel happy
in the conviction that some one yet
lives to win his country and his coun

sonal ambition. What if we should
lay all this feeling aside for once,
cominig up to the line as patriots
slhoull, nmeeting and organizing as a
people, thllrowing aside every tainted
politician, taking hold ourselves;
what a noble and lastidg sueccess, un
sullied with persounl regrets, would
be the next election.
Let us appeal to every impulse of
our nobler Lature, sink the gross feel

those God-like attributes, with which
the great Creator has endowned the
fairest work of his hand. Let the
people, the real, true people, take the
matter in hand, and reviving the
memories, tihe feelings, of those pure
patriots of thie revolution, strive .by
all means in our power to imitate
their illustrious example.
Select your own representatives;
discard thile man who attempts to

Packard-Leonard Correspond.
ence.
We do not agree with our friend,
the Shreveport 'l/ijne., in its sum wing
up o)f Packard's meaning in his letter
to Mr. Leonard.
To us, the U811 and ºslhstance ap
prears to he about this: Packard pro
poses to "infuse" a few more new of
ficials into Its radical party; to "re
ward" them with office; to break
down the white vote with specious
promises, and thereby give -life and
vitality to an lready dead party.
Thi whole move is intended to
beInefit the lnegro alone ; tecontinuell
legislating and taxing that good may
come to himil and his. The white
property owner is not considered at
all, on the contrary, it is plainly stated
that this new departure is intended
to "promote the interest ;" to "pro
mote the welfare" of the negro by
"insuring a government honest and
scrupulous to protect his (the negro's)
person and property,"' and to be, at
the same time, "in accord with the
National IRepublican party."t If we
coinmprehend the spirit of the letter, it
means, that we shall embrace the
creed and party, that has for eight
long and dreary years, done every
thing in its power to crush us out,
and in this grand and glorious frater
nal exhibition, Mr. Leonard is asked
to be one of the figure-heads.
Packard asks us to relinquish the
reins of victory to such men as lie
may select, (whom the negroes will
reward, for thus betraying their cause
and people) and IIE promises reform
reform to benefit the negro, and pro
tect his person and property--when
the cause for all the evils we now
labor under, is just such reform ; too
much legislation to protect the negro,
and none to benefit the State-too
'much rewrard to those who are the
"scrupulous" friends of the African
citizen.
This is what Mr. Packard mCeans to
do, all his promises are like "ropes of
sand"-easily made and as easily bro
ken.

The position of the New York Sun
is to-day sounder on all Democratic
questions than that of even the boast
ed l'orld. In its issue of Ilth Sept.
in an article in relation to the Penn
sylvania Democratic platform, it says,
with regard to the currency plank:
The ideas and the policy here set
forth are fallacious in theory and will
be intjurious in practice. We repudi
ate themn, and denounce them ; anid
the violent struggle which attended
their adoption by the Convention,
proves that a very large minority of
the Pennsylvania Democracy repudi
ate and denounce themt also.
But what shall this minority do?
What shall independent voters, look
ing to the best good of the State and
of the country, do I Slhall they turn
against the ticket inomilateld by this
Convention with Judge Pershing at
its head, who has just inlticted con
dign punishenwt utponl the public roh,
hers in Schuylkill county t Shall they
support thle Cameron-Mackey-Kema
ble ticket in preference f Can any
sensible man take such a course ? We
say No.
Trhe currency question to-day in
Penosylvania is an abstraction; but
the existence of the Treasury Ring is
a pernicious, far reaching reality.
Another reality, worse nod more per
nicious, is Grantism in the national
Administration, and this the Treasu
ry Ring is identified with and repre
sents. The first duty is to expel and
reform these great and actual evils.
No believer in hard money, and no
friend of ihonest government, should
fail to support the Erie ticket because
of anything objectionable respecting
this abstraction that is contained in
the platform.
The position of the Southern States
under radical rule is the same as
above expressed. We clre not for a
fight on currency, tarriff, &c., and do
not propose to make any. Our efforts
will be directed to the overthrow of
Grantism, and the rule established by
him South.
Louisiana, Mississippi and South
Carolina, are the only States that re
main to-day under the grinding rule
of radical thieves; our ideas are, of
course, for more money, but we also
have a great desire to keep it-keep
it from being swallowed up in taxes
keep it from being deflected from
legitimate purposes when put in the
State Treasury. To rid ourselves
ofsuclh men as Chamberlain, Ames
and Kellogg, with all their followere,
will be the key note of the political
contest in these States next year,
leaving thile subjects of currency, and
other legitimate topics, to regulate
themselves when we have first regula
ted our internal affairs.
DELANO, not having been able
to stand the pressure, has con
cluded to resign. A Democratie
House of Representatives in the
dim distance, possesses no little
terror for "Indian ring" short-com
ings and Marsh's charges having
been verified, Delano, like a good
statesman, seeks the classic shades
of retirement. Grant closes his
acceptance of this worthy's resig
nation pretty much as follows:
"You can take with you the assur
ance of my esteem and firm belief
ofyour honesty. You only yield
to the clamors of an ignorant and
ungreatful public who don't know
a "good thing when they see it."
"Gone into the Red Blanket and

Prepare for Action.
The Packard-Leonard correspon
dence lays bare the whole plan of the
radical party in Louisiana and the
time for action on our ,part 1,has atrired.
Hlow this gamea came to light we will
not now stop to enilrire. Som; good
men inl New Orleans evidently got
hold of the matter and brought it
before the people. We, who have
heretofore opplosed the assenmbling
of a convention of the D)emocratic
party in Novenmhler in this State, have
had our motives entirely miscon
strued, at least the Vindicator has,
and now we consider the time for ac
tion is at hand, and no journal hold
ing the respect and confilence of the
white people, should give factious op
position to this imperative dlemand.
The situation requires it ; our people,
since seeing that Packard, Kellogg
and others construe their silence into
subnmission ; our opposition, for iuat
etial and good reasons to the pro
posed convention, into an antipathy
to the Denmocratlc party ; or that the
plmrpose of the 'cli)alrbioni," as Pack
ard terms theml, "are distasteful to
Whig elements as as well as the Con
servative or Liber;d party." Our peo
ple, as we said, demand, and that
instantly, that we give the lie to
these utterances. Our office has been
visited thismorning by many pure,
true and tried gciitlemen--gen:tlemeu
formerly Whigs, Liberals and Con
servatives, and all are in favor of res
ponding to the call of the Democratic
party, and that immediately.
Let us show to Packard that he has
reconed "without his host"; that he
may offer the bribe of office, of high
places, to some men, but that the great
body of Louisiana's people, her true
sons, not the vile sneaks that snuff
spoils and are ever ready to make
footstools of themselves for paltry
pay, are not to be thus tampered with.
Let us show to them that the short
time from January to this, has not
been sufficient to eradicate from our
hearts and minds the great wrongs
they have committed against us ; that
the reverance for our dead of the 14th
September-dead in the holy cause
of freedom, is too pure to be sullied
with the foul touch of the political
associations of such as Packard, Kel
logg, Longstreet, Wells, Anderson.
We will convince them in a short
time that our bitter feeling against
them has not ceased to exist, but only
slumbers. Let us all come to the
front and with one mighty effort kill
effectually the damnably punjured
radical party of Louisiana.
YELLOW FEVER.-Our city has
been in a state of much excite
ment during the past week from
the report that yellow fever exist.
ed at Cooshatta.
Tlelegrams front the Post Sur
geon of the U. 8. Army there sta
tioned, developed the truth of the
report.
Two deaths had occurred amnbug
the soldiers, and four cases were
under treatment at last accounts.
This excitement was greatly
augmented wifth the news, nupon
Wednesday last, that Mr. J. J.
McCook, merchant, of' the firm of
J. J. MeCook & Bro., who lately
returned front New Orleans, was
down with this dread disease. In
quiry developed the fact that that
report was also true, as the report
of the Physicians to the Board of
IHealth, hereunto appended, will
show. The case was very light,
and the patient now doing well.
Every precaution has been takem
to prevent the spread of the dis
ease, and no apprehension exists
of its becoming epidemic, or that
there is any .danger at all from it.
Should there be, the public can
rest assured that they will be
promptly notified.

Your Health Officer has the honor
to report, having seen Mr. McCook,
and no doubt from all the evidlenace
gathlered, hlie has aniferred with an at
tack almost identical with a mnildi ease
of yellow fever. Would recommend
that his preOmises be thoroughlly dis
infected with a pure article of Carbol.
ic Acid. Particularly in the rear,
where the night glass has been empti
ed in the open street, since his illness.
Public privies clean and contain lime.
Large ditch in good order; market
house cleanu. Would recoaaumend Mr.
McCook's partial isolation for a few
days, and laave for him a good ex
perienlced nurse, who has had yellow
fever, to attend him, &c.

F. J. Stokes, Parish Judge of Grant
parish, has becan arrested upon requis.
itioji from the Governor ofTexas, and
left New Orleans Wednesday, charg.
ed with awing a defaulting tax collet..
or fnrom that State.
This is the same man who was em.
played by the fusionists in 1872, to
swindle the voters of Terrelonne par.
ish. We have never been able to
understand how Governor Kellogg
came to appoint him to a judicial
position, knowing full well his char.
acter and general reputation.-St.
Jam,,es Sen ine!l.
It is rather strange that Geo.E.
Borce "has never been able to as
dcrstand" why Gov. Kellogg appoint.
ed Stokes. If "any other man" had
expressed surprise at these little short
comings of Kellogg, we might be as
tonished thereat.
Kellogg is judged in this section by
the average atficial he appoints, anad
as Borce himself has in time enjoyed
the honor (1) of Kellogg's politial
preferment, we see no reason to esom
plain of the honored Governor's (t) ap
pointment of Stokes, a jail bird frog
Texas, as parish judge of Grant par
ish.
He will compare favorably, not
withstanding this slight (?); defect,
amazingly well with all of Kellogg's
appointees as far as we know.
As far as the "fusionists" are con
cerned, we believe that the great
majority of the great (?) leaders have
gone into the party of Kellogg and
the usurpers, either as hangers on or
"pap bottle suckers."
Warmoth and his part of the party
are about "played out," unless the
radicals want material for a new Gov.
ernor, then wer will see an exhibitios
of "dog eating vomit," on a first cla -
scale; Bovee will gulp his abae
without salt.
Should justice be meeted out even
hianlded, the meleneholy fate of Stokes
wohl Ibe that of ye average Radicals
from Maine to Texas.
Let one thing be remembered by
our legislatoms when they assemble
next January, and that is, the tax
payers expect them todo their duty.
We want no higgling over mileage sad
per diem-no vote taken on appe
printion bills until all measures of s
fori. are introduceed, passed beth
houses and received the Govermn'
signature.
If Mr. Kellogg and his Senarm
refuse to enact, let the diaum be withL
them. Our members must thee ad
journ the house sihe die and dead leek
the government.
Let us have reform or nothing.
