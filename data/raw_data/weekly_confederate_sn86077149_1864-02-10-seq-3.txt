V. "e mentione I yesterday, very concisely, the
m:; :.-i:ii'u bj thee Officers in the late move

t. vcrod i'i the tone and tenner of their cora

Tac-e two eScers are strikingly dissimilar to j

If we hear aright, the tJuiiford meeting of
agitators was a loisterous and disorderly
concern, in which the hootings, howlings,
screechings and, whistlings, of the toy was not I
the least sensible of the performance.
Verily, when men are run mad with fo'.ly and
passion " out of the mouth of babes and
sucklings, wisdom is perfected." But the
wonder is extraordinary, that all the oratory
of that distinguished political debater, Mr. II
V. Dick, could nut produce harmony ! Where

ia a caddidate for Congress from the Stat'3 of
Kentucky. As ho weighs about five hundred
pounds, the presumption is, that if elected, he
will be able to Gil his seat, lie is much bet
ter qualified for Cougrcss than fjr Light Infantry.
We are glad to announce the arrivaj, a daj
or two since, in this city," of Capt. Alfred'
Stanly, of Beaufort County. Capi. Stanly
was taken prise ncr by the enemy srne time
during last summer. About 10, o'clock in the
uiglu he hrard some noise, and taking his gun,
went out in his yard to see what was ihe mat
ter. On reaching the corner of the house he
was called on to surrender ; " whereupon he
immediately raised his -uu to fire at the Yan
kee demanding it. The cap unfortunately
burst, and while attempting a second time to
fire off his gun, he was seized by twenty-five
or thirty Yankees, who were "secreted under
and around his house. lie was taken and.
carried to Washington and placed iu the dun
geon of the jail, where he remained eight days ;
after which ie was sent to F. rt Mcllenry, near
Baltimore, when; he re named ia closo con
finement until a few days since, when he was
exchanged.
dpt. Sta dy's sufferings were very severe,
having to sleep on a bard l'oor, and with but
one blanket, (which he furnished himself.)
He bore them, however, with the most heroic
endurance, evincing during the whole time,
gre-t determination and boldness, and openly
manifested upon every occasion his hatred for
the enemy, and his disregard and contempt
f r their malignity; and though now nearly
sixty years old, he looks as well, if not better,
than before his long imprisonment. A man
of his indomitable spirit and conscientious de
votion to his country, can never hrt subdued.
Capt. Stanly has been of great service to our
cause in the Eastern part ol the State: long
may he live to enjoy the reward to which his
mcri'ed services entitle him. He is a brother

Gen. Magruder has issued -a general order
that all non-commissioned officers and privates
who distinguished themselves in any engage
ment in his command shall be presented with
a suitable badge, with the cross of the Legion
on Ihrnor engraved on it. Tie badge is
similar to those presented b3'theGreat Napo
leon to his veterans, and which was considered
the highest mark of esteem a soldier could
wear bv the entire French nation.
The rumor that Snhn.lk was being again
occupied by Yankee troops, is, we are assured,
wholly without foundation. A gentleman
who was there Tuesday , states that there is
not a Yankee soldier, white or block, in the
place.

The following is an account of the
CAFTCllE OP A YANKEE AUMY TRAIN aEVERE
FIGHT IN HARDY COUNTY, VA.
The following dispatch is telegraphed to
the New York papers :
Headers Dep't Western Virginia, 1 .
January 31, 1864. J
Ag;iin we are in the midst of excitement
and activity, caused by a severe conflict that
took phice ylsterdiy afterno-n in the neigh
borhood of Witliamsport, Hardy county, aud
which lasted, with considerable persistence
and severity, for four hours.
- Ou Thursday night a train of about eighty
wagons was sent oat from New Creek, heavily
ladtn with comn-issary stores for the garrison
at Petersburg, and accompcanying the train
was an escort of 800 men, being detachments
from the 231 Illinois, (Irisa 15-igade,) 4th
Virginia infantry, .and 100 of the Ringgold
cavalry battalion, the whole under command
of J. W. Snyder.
Nothing unusual occurred until the train
got about three miles south of William sport,
when it was suddently set upon at different
points by open aud concealed forces of the
enemy.
Although somewhat surprised by the sudden
ness of the attack, the guard at once formed
and deployed for action, Then it was that a
hand fight ensued, commencing at 3 o'clock in
tlie afternoon and lasting for over four hours,
at the expiration of which time it was fuuud
taat we had about 80 in killed and wou dtd,
rank and file. The. enemy's loss is said to be
about 100.
Iu the early part of the fight the rebels
opened fire from four f ieces. of artillery. The
superiority of the enemy's strenh there
being iu all about ',000 men also gave them
an advantage in our hanking movements, and
the enemy exercised his ingenuity simultane
ously to operate on the fimt, rear and flanks of
Coh rfnyder's command.
The enemy, however, completely failed of
his object, which se ined to be to try io sur
round, and, if possible, to capture the wlele
tarty. Several times the reb"l lines were
broke.., and several times the u-bel char 1:03
were repulsed.
At last, as night close !, the superior num
bers of the rebels, and not their great lighiiuir
qualities, gained them a success.
At one time the train was in a fair way of
being entirely saved ; but owing to the excita
ble ki ".dadlii'i: propeositii s of soir e few of the
teamsters, and ihe eil'c t of their induct on

Reproof to the Doubters. .
The Richmond correspondent . of the London
Times refers to the uudoubting -faith of the
North that the Stars and Stripes will ultimately
assert their ascendancy over the seceded States,
and contracts this firm assurance with the
absurd -aud irrational despondency, and douVt
which all our marvellous military successes
have not been able to dispel from some minds
in (he South.
The Timea'a correspondent will do us a sertice
if he can shove the croakers arid jy-umblcrs into
a more hopeful and manly attitude ; but we
submit that they are not the true exponents of
thespirit and sentiment of the country. Coining
in contact chiefly with citizens, and not with
soldiers, it is natural that a stranger should ex
press tjie opiuions we nud in the letters of the
Times. Lut the country is now to be fouud in
the army, not among those who stay at home.
The heart, the brains, the bravery, the patriot
ism, the chivalry of the Confederate States are.
to be found in front of the foe, and not in the
pursuits of civil life. We must look to the army
if we want to know whether the faith and hupe
of-the South are equal to the hope and faith of.
lue .oriu in rue issue ot the co'utest. An J
never did hope and faith burn brighter iu
hu man hearts than in those which are readv to
shed their last drop of blood in the cause. It
is stated by those who h ive recently visited the
army that it is really a relief to get away from
the gloomy atmosphere cf tradeand speculation
and mingle with the fighting men ; it raises the
spirits, strengthens the faith, and animates the
hope to come in contact with the veterans who,
for three yVirs, have f ught triumphantly
against the greatest odds the North cWld
bring, and who feel as sure that they can whip
her again as that they have whipped her .
hundred times before.
We do not consider that all the non-combatants
of the country are faithless and des
pondent. But many of them are old men
and unmanned by the infirmities of age, and,
many more so immersed In the pursuits of
money -getting, that tin- sentiment f patriot
ism bus; nearly died out. Others are naturally
timid, and have the instinct of self-preservation,
which has kept them out of the army,
unduly developed. Others are faultfinders
and factionists, who are more iutc-ut upon
gratifying their personal prejudices than so
licitous tor the success of the cause, 'flu 11
there are the constitutional croakers, the frogs
and bats and owls, who de!i-.;ht in daikm.-s.
and who are never so happy as when t: ey
are miserable. The smallest cloud in the sky
is magnified into a coming thunder storm,
ami a regular thunder storm into the end o'
the worid. liven when w a e victorious,
their utterances f exult, iM ..i arc as Itiguhii
ous as iho cio.ving of a Shmghea cock, -in l
intimate in every t ne a donht ff th; perma

for anything, if they were even tit to be eaV:,

The Standard on the lilght or Secession.
We have rccci?cd a letter from a eubscriber
in Franklin county, of whieh the following is
aa extract :
"As the adherents cf the Standard are try
ing, for effect, to blend the present friends of
Southern liberty with the original constitutionnl
secessionists, and also asser the converse, viz:
that the Standard's party ia coniposed'of those 1
who denied the constitutional right of secession; 1
and as, to this end, they deny your charge that .
the Standard erer advocated and taught the !
doctrine of secessdon, I retpiest that you publish 1
such extract from your files of that paper as !
prove its advocacy of that doctrine not to .
sitisfy me, or anv intelligent reader of the
StHt-dird, but to silence unscrupulous dema
gogues, and enlighteu the credulous ignorant."
It is probable that these Franklin county
followers of the Standard have been misled by
thut paper of the 8th pit., in which it is said:
41 Nor is it true that we "educated the people
in the doctrine of secession," ami then "voted
them" into the present war." We never main
tained .the docttine of secession as practiced by
the cotton States, and we resisted secession up
to the last moment."
In reply to this a contemporary very pcr
titiently asks. " if the Standard did not main
tain the doctrine as practiced by tho cotton
States,'' what sort of doctrine of s cession was
that it did maintain ? To this i f ciur?e tho
Standard has not ventured to reply, for il is
not easy to conceive of more than two kiuds
of secession, viz : peaceable secession, aud se
cession with war as a consequence. The
cotton States, as is well knowii, always con
' tended f r tho riht of peaceable scces.-do.i ;
and we think the Stan. .aid will' hardly 'pre
tend that it went for the other sort cf seces
sion. But wc intend to comply with our corres
pondent's request, by showino that the Stan
dard il 1-i maintain " the right f secession,"
without any p.ta:iticatit)n ab.mt the cotton
States or anything the. And what is very
remarkable, it maintstined this d ocMitie for -eleven
years, viz: from 1850 to 1S01 how

and the Stand im wue careful to h.ve it tsn
dtitood that it was not revolution ("not re

ferson calls it ''separation from our compan

had not bircn "educated" in the doeliuc of
stccsi.-ioi) and therefore avproached it cau
tiously, gingerly. Fifty years afterwards
the Standard calls it the right to "withdraw
or secede."
Well, this was in 1851. Ten years later,
in O.tobtr 1SG1, (-co Standard, Oct. CO,
18G1.) the Standard says lint North Carolina
seceded in May" not revolted, but necelad
The Kditor vi the Standard was a member o
the Convention which thus '"seceded," and h
voted for iho Ordinance of Focesidon. JJi

the gamo paper . (October SOth 1801.) toj
Standard said : ..,. ,
"As soon as Lincoln called for troop" to
make war on tho South; Arc denounced .him aj
a usurper, and turned our tack on tho out
Union without end. We did this, toOvi h
die most entire consistency, for wx iiad aij

A right to Bccedo for cause' was the iden
tical doctrine taught by the " Cotton btate
politicians. And it was that very " right to
Lcedo for causa" which the .Cotton States ex
ercised in 1 SCO. Tbe"caso" which tb f
assigned (an iosnfficicnt one tee thongnt lot
destroying tho Union,) was the election o. ft
Eiack Uepublican, sectional ticket to the chief .
o.Uce of the Union. It was the identical caiuci
repeatedly assigned by tho Standard as suf

not think the Standard will have the hardi
hood to deny this. 13t if it bo denied, why
wc have befuro us another search through lia
tiles in 1S50 when Freaioutaud Dayton wero
Candidates. .
We have made thos-e extracts from .tho
Standard's more cautious leading article.,
they were written when secessionists and se
cession were somewhat under ft cloud, its ad
vycates havinjj been forced by the people to
" acipiitwe " (such was the cant language ot
that day and used by the Standard itself abov-)
in the Ccmpramisc measures of 1850. v o
have not taken a single extract from tho uv-nr
violcn; and unguarded dclarations ot thu
.StandarJ in tho hot political campaign be
tween 1S1U an l 1800, in which it was tho
lea ling iritof the secession party of ortli
Carollua, and deiiotuiccd as uusouud or trai-
torous every distinguished man of the old wins
and ai.ti-seeessh'n'party. - Wo think wo Lav.-,
given the information desired by our corres
pondent ai d tvtablis-ied our own opinion that .
" flic Standard had educated tho people Uho
dm tiinc of secession." Dot if any one sliouM
preiend that tho above is not sufficient evi-u-i.ce,
tl.irc is pleiity more to be had. ,
