DAMAGES FOR LIBEL.
A lirglla Taper Brought to Terms i,r
the American Book Company.
A dispatch from Norfolk. Va, says:
"The American Book company of .New
York bas just gained asignal victory in thbs
courts of Virginia and has received an ab
solute and complete vindication after a long
and exhaustive trial by special jury in the
Circuit court of this city. The Pilot news
paper of this city. upon the awardilng of
the contract for school books to the Amer
loan Book (ompany, printed a long article
written and prepared by It. E. Byvrd. an
agent and attorney forGmnn & Co.. of New
lork, in which it was charged that the
state superintendent had been bribed by I
the American Boos company. The Pilot
was immediately sued for libel, and, after
a five weeks' trial, which create' an im
mense amount of interest throughout the
state, a verdict for punitive damagte was
recently awarded, and the jury found that
the statements made were false and a
deliberate libel. Not only so, but the C
bompany, upon uniml exchable evidence, c
was proved to havedealt honorably and up t
rightly in every particular in their negotia
tions with the state officials. It was furtb
er proved at the trial that no better terms I
had been made with any ther state for t
school books. In fact, the attorney-general
of Virginia stated that the American Book
company seemed to throw open their whole
business to us,' and, after full and complete c
examine' ion of all the original contracts s
made wl .b the various states he expressed t
himself as absolutely satisfied that the
prices were the same in all cases and that I
lno discrimination whatever had been made i
against the state of Virginia. Furthermore t
he mentioned that none of the statements
of the American Book company had been
accepted until every one of them had been t
absolutely verified by direct reference to E
the governors of some fifteen states, with
whom contracts had been made. This c
proved conclusivelythat the representations
of the American Book company were cor
rect in toto. This celebrated case has thus I
ended in a complete triumph in every re
spect for the American Book company, and
has shown in clear contrast the clean and
business-like methods in which they carry
on their great industry as compared with
the attempted use of political pulls and
misstatements by their opponents."--Gh t

I.lttlejohn and His Mule.
A worm will turn, and so will ac
mule, as Muledriver Littlejohn found s
to his cost in an Ohio coal mine. He t
was, ordinarily, very cruel to the ani- s
mal, and when it became refractoryv
the other day as he was bringing it v
out of the mine he began to beat it t
with a club. The mule became des
terate and assaulted him in a vicious
manner. Littlejohn turned and fled t
down the dark entry, his light be- a
coming extinguished as he ran. The r
mule chased him through the entry s
and penned him up in a dark room, li
where a hard-fought battle took t
place, the mule climbing on Little- n
john's body and biting off his left
hand near the wrist. Littlejohn's a
cries brought assistance, but he was e
nearly dead when rescued. n
Passed Away.
The hermit of the old-fashioneu t
mansion at the corner of Broadway t
and Nineteenth street, New York. is b
sleeping her last sleep. She was Mrs. a
Hannah E. Gerry. daughter of the
late Peter P. Goelet and mother of
Comodore Gerry, and leaves her heirs a
at least $10,000,000. The venerable r
old lady's demise will probably soon t
be followed by the passing away of 1
the ancient landmark at the spot a
mentioned, which has long been the
only relic of rurality in the heart of the
great city. _

HOW HE ROASTS THEM
4 DEMOCRAT AFTER HIS STUPID
BRETHREN.
He Pointes Out, With Undealeble Correct
mess, the Many lumaders of Our I.egis
Intors, and Shows la Plain Words the
Humilliatig Statae of Our Laws.
The Austin correspondent of the
r Dallas Nets, who is a Democrat of
t the strictest sect, writes that paper
under date of September 21 as follows:
" In Texas for many years the com
plaint of all concerned bas been the
law's delay. From this timo the un
certainty of the law is added to the
causes that make the citizen regret
the very existence of legislatures,
courts and governmental agencies.
s Here this past week we had the spec
r tacle of a chief justice declaring a law
inoperative, a governor declaring he
would execute that very law if he
" could get enough men to back him,
and an attorney general upholding
the same law, while turning out of the
t law mill two opinions declaring the
a futility of two other laws passed at
the same session. An act of the leg
islature runs the gauntlet of guberna
torial veto, clerical blundering, attor
ney general's analysis and judicial
construction nowadays before any
I body can safely trust it as having any
place or authority. The legislature
" may turn it out of committee all right
and after approval by the governor
some fatal defect is found. A clerk
may have murdered it by leaving a
word out of the caption, by omitting
the enacting clause or by inserting
a word or words which had been
stricken out. Let it safely pass the
careless committees and the deadly
s clerk, pass the governor and prove
I acceptable to the people then comes
a the attorney general with theories of
strict construction and declares it in
! valid. Then the people accept the
t verdict and it is no law for anybody
t to respect or obey.
Later a litigous citizen, whose in
terests are affected, brings it before
I the court and it is declared valid by
a civil supreme court. No appeal is
taken and for years the law is re
spected as authority. Finally another
litigant has the question submitted to
the supreme court and it Is declared a
nullity.
t These are acts the validity of which
may be adjudicated by this latter
court and also by the court of crimi
nal appeals, both being courts of final
resort and independent of each other.
For instance. this prize fight legisla
tion will doubtless be adjudicated by
the court of criminal appeals and may
be brought before the supreme court
any day by application for mandamus
against the comptroller. These courts,
it is understood, have not always
agreed as to what is the law. As a
rule it may be assumed that
there is some defect of greater or
less importance in every statute
adopted by recent Texas legislatures,
and when the validity of one
of these experiments are seriously
questioned, as often happens, the
chances are overwhelmingly in favor
of its invalidity. There are radical
defects and errors and grave ques
tions of validity involved in numerous
acts of the last three legislatures.
Game laws, road loads and land laws,
tax laws, the special courts, as that
at Texarkana, the laws regulating
public printing, laws to refund money
paid on school lands, laws giving re
lief to purchasers of school lands and
various other acts in the operation of
which a great many people are direct
ly interested are yet of uacertain va
lIdity and likely to be condemned by
the attorney general, by some justice
of the peace, or county judge. or
som district court or some court of
last resort Heads of bureaus and de
partments are in the same business.
The laws are assaulted all along the
line up to the highest courts and
r even thes in future years will over
role their predecessors' opinions and
I deoisions.
SHence the people have been edu
c ated to regard the decapitation or
suppression of statotes by clerks,
committeesu, governors, state omcials
and the oourts without surprise, and
a ln fact the surprise is that any act
is foaund to stand the fusillade and to
a men what it was Iatended by the
r legislature. This shameful uncer
Stalnty as to our laws is due to legis
I lative stepidity in the maln, and this
a stupidity is the nlaevitable result of
I seadtng incompetent and ignorant

The learned chief justice had a dif
ficult problem to decide, but then
there was the unquestioned law prob
abilities which required him at the
outset to follow the rule that any re
cent act is presumed to be invalid un
til everybody is satisfied that it will
stand. It was first doubtless pre
sumed to be defective, then it was upon
inspection found to be incongruous
and uncertain, and was finally dis
covered to have been repealed by
another somewhat shaky brother act.
Whether Justice Hurt was correct in
his decision I would not undertake to
say. Whether Gen. Crane is correct no
man can say for certain during this
century. The disagreement is no just
occassion for intemperate abuse of Jus
tice Hurt, such as one hears in the gov
ernment offices, nor is it any justifi
cation for the criticisms of the gov
ernor and attorney which prevail on'
the streets. The judge, as public
coroner, simply declared the defunct
law demised by inanity and the
other side proposed to try the case
and demand further tests as to the
status of the legislative stiff. The
judge has no more concern about it.
This situation does not call for hys I
terical denunciations of an honorable
and conscientious judge, nor for im
precations against the crown offMers
and their legal advisers. It is a situ
ation which may arise any day under
the glorious uncertainty of Texas
laws. If it be unpleasant to the pub
lic, let the public proceed to correct
the system responsible for it.
Who is to blame for this state of
affairs? Beyond a question the Dem
ocratic leaders, for they have been in
power in this state uninterruptedly
for 19 years. It goes to prove the
charges made all along by Populists,
as to their incompetency and
stupidity.

Hon. Bryan T. Barry admits **that
there rests upon a candidate who ac
cepts the nomination of a party an
obligation to defend and carry out as
candidate and officer the declarations
and promises of the party," but says
,"that obligation does not extend to
the citizen and has never been held
to do so. No party has ever asked
more of the voter than to vote for its
nominee." Mr. Barry seems to con
sider this generous and considerate
of the party, but it implies very clear
ly that the party regards the voter
as merely a headleas jackass to be
used at the ballot box and then turned
out to grass.-Dallas News.
Why, bless your soul, that is good
Democracy. All the leaders want is
for the people to vote the ticket, and

A Â·orrespendent of the D)allas News
from Galveston. speaking of the con
fused condition of our laws. says:
But the attorney general and the
governor are not the only ones who
have doubts, and serious ones. as to
the validity of the law. Eminent ju
rists from one end of the state to the
other, before and since the Hurt opin
ion, have declared the law invalid,and
this in itself is enough to condemn it
on constitutional grounds, for the
reason that the constitution provides
uncertain as to be of doubtful con
struction. or words to that effect, it
is inoperative and not to be ecforced.
It is suggested that not only
this prize-fighting statute. but many
other acts of the Twenty-fourth leg
islature, if not its entire
code.- will ultimately be found
invalid. It has also been
intimated that the governor is hold
ing up the contract for printing the
codes because of the troublesome
doubt as to their validity, and the
bearing such a conclusion would have
on the status of the acts relating to
glove contests. If he is not holding
up the contract for this reason why is
he holding it up at all? Not because
there is no money with which to pay
for the printing, as a special act was
passed by the last legislature appro
priating $25,00t for that purpose -an
act entirely separate from the general
appropriation bill, in which errors
were detected. All things considered,
it looks very much as if his excellency
was somewhat afraid of the law him
self.

of John C. Calhoun. John Sherman

Should Blake, for instance, or Sam

able circumstances, any man making
the race in the Seventh district next
year under Democratic colors must
have from t300U to $1).,00J to spend
if he means to win. for without the
negro vote he can't win, and it costs
money to control the elusive African

Walter Baker or Seth Mills might
be nominated with a reasonable ex

scratch around pretty lively without

The principles of modern Democ
racy are '.spoils" and place hunting.
When a Democrat gets an office his
,,principles" are carrieu into effect
as far as he is concerned. But there
being an insufficiency of offices to go
round only a very small per cent of
the brethren ever see their ,,princi
ples" carried into effect, but the av
erage Democratic patriot is a very
patient kind of a being and he lives
in constant hope that he will live to
see his *"principle" go into effect.
However, the outlook now is some
what discouraging, as there is dark
ness coming over the '.grand old
party." It looks very much like its
