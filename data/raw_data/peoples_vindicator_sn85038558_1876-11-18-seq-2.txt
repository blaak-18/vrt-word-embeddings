NOTICE.
All parties indebted to
this paper are requested to
settle up at once.
SMr. Alex. Simmons is
authorized collecting agent
and will call upon all our
country friends for the
money due the Vindicator.
A prompt attention to
this call will be thankfully
appreciated.
Go to Mc~ook & Bro., for fresh
drugs and medicines.
The River is dead low. and no pros
pects of good water. Navigation is
in a measure suspended.
Democratic majority in Sabine, 8SG.
Well done, noble Sabine.
Will nothing he done to repair the
public road from this to Grand Ecore ?
Fancy scarfs, shawls and cloaks at
McCook & Bro.
We give elsewhere a full statement
of the vote of Louisiana as east at
the polls, and our friends can rest as
.crred it will be so counted.
There is more involved in the Re
turning Beard of Louisiana this time
thn the mere State officials, and our
friends in tjhe Union will not submit
to see us and themselves outraged.
Call at McCook &Bro., for every
thing in the Dry Goods and Grocery
tine, you will certainly find it there.

The Radicals of this place look as
blue as any set of men we ever saw.
It is certainly time that other men
should win, after a ten years outrage
from Radical thieves.
The weather turned quite cold on
Tuesday last, and we had a good rain,
the first in five months, of any mo
:ment.
Cotton conies in now with a rush
and we hope our country friends w ill
• ot forget us when they settle irp.
Try the fresh Texas tlour of Mc
Cook & Bro.
"That coat is nice, where did you
get it"l At McCook & Bro., plenty
of them and cheap!
Mayor Dranguet and his newly
elected Board will take charge of thea
aftairs of our city in a few weeks we i
suppose. Right now we have this-to
suggest. Three thousand dollars is
amply suffteiant to defray the ex
penses of this city. Under the Frank
Nicholls State government the pro
perty valuation of the city will be
boMut $400,000. This will be a tax
t:ien ofI of 1 per cent instead of two
,lCr cent.
Thou cllect all future city taxes ill

What Work Is To B. Done
The lpople of Louisiana, long cheat
cd of those rights which are dealer
lba li'fe' to a leophl' orn of Replb
lices adml nitured in fieedmn, have
heltu c them, upon the sneicss of free
1a1;!!t, a wlfi k in magnoitrudle as great
:I, that of dragging vicltol from the
ilws of pafl izan frauds and radical
rascality.
We have learmned since I(5 l that
% e are of. a "new order of things'
nld imlst adapt ourselves to the sur
roundings.
A new factor, both as a voter and
a citizen, has been created by law
in oir midst and it first becomes us
to adjust all differences between thern
:1114l uis, ulipon the solid basis of equal
rightsl. beobre the late.
We find the colored people on our
handlls as volters, after eight years of
persis!tent aplpeal to their passions and
frilljdices ilW the party we hb- -,just
defeated, and it now hecomes our
dut to I:ake thorn in hand and ednli
cate them to a higher, more m1(al
anil .c\ ated standing.
The question of poulllar edueation
must be agitated amrl the chiilren of
all classes antld all colors of our State
must be educated at the public ex
pellee.
We are emplhatieally in favor of a
vi..nlou1 s public school s'stem. (O r
it hire a.d ciil (,rc1l y11uh have grown
u1p in lainentable ignoranice, to ren
der them reasoning citizens, w itholut
which ni government ,an prosper,
their education becomes a1, imlpea'l ive
necessity, and tue feel assured the
co-operation of every citizen will
be heartily elicited. Then comnies
the eradication of had laws, of class
legislation and immoral monopoly en
ctments. 'I'hese particulars in our11
civil code will be looCked to with close
attention.
The vigoronn enforcement of crim
inal law and the suppression of crime
must and will have the support of all
classes of good citizens. Then conies
the question of immigration and its
twin sister, public improvements,
upon which our people are somewhat
divided-that is, they are all in favor
of the improvements but upon the
manner of building them up there
exists some difference of opinion. We
feel assured, however, that all these
nmatters will in time meet the atten
tion of our Democratic officials ; that
thecy will be fully and thoroughly in
angurated no one doubts ; that they
will be vigorously carried to triumph
ant snccess every one feels assured.
The past andt with it afl things that
are of the past, all men that savor of
and represent the past must step aside.
They have had their day which was
a night to virtue and civilization ; but
now coimes the REFOR.M party withl
its intelligence and capital and it
imust liit and will not hie tramnmellced
with the frands and outrages ofthe
ipast.

Regira.
Quite an amnusing spectacle was
presented to our people on Tuesday
asut, and thle mirth of the affair has
its point as well.
As soon as the troops departed,
Blunt, Bredn, Myers, and other hith
erto "bold and out-spoken Republi
cans," took flight with them.
\VWe have seen no danger that should
be apprehended by these fellous; no
one has threatened them, and their
flight can only be the departure of
the "goilty, when no man pursneth."
And thlese are the men that would
act as public offieials. These are tlhe
men tlhat would correct abuses and
reform society-would protect the
public and enf;orce law and order.
Men that flte firom their own guilt
when not a word us spoken or an arm
!rised algainist them.
SIt is a mirthful commentary, but a
sad one, and shows to what a depth
we have descended under Republican
rule in Louisiana. From this flight
thile fiilhful can reckon the return of
order and prosperity.

It should be remembered that just
at this time the New Orleans Bulletin,
withl certified copi's of all returns of
election accessible to its reporters,
ihas not ventured an opinion as to
who has probahly carried Louisiana,
but is busily engaged in' lampooning,
in a feeble and disgAsting manner,
the distinguished Democratic gentle
men from the North who have in res
pnse to MLr. HI-witt's call come to
Louisiana to see to a fair count.
Remember that McCook & Bro.

Grant's Order,
We have for soime years borne lo
caly the military usurpations of tihe
radical adininistration, not without
indignant protest, however, but with
out, we are pained to admit, that
moral and phIysical force which a peo
ple who ate so loud spoken of their
love of liberty and fair play as the
Northern citizen, should have freely
and promptly given us. However,
thl' scene has changed and to-day we
look uip a spectacle well ealeul ated to
shake the confidence of the patriot in
the stability of Repilbliean institu
tionis.
I'lon the heels of the recent elec
tion and upon the triumphant sue
c(ss of the reformn President, Mr. Til
den, the military ,f the Repullic steps
in and attempt. to overthrow the will
oJf the people cerprc'.se(l at the ballot
bor.
Grant's order has indeed "nation
alized" Louisiana, and tlihe INON will
now taste the cffet of a tadical South
erm Ietturning, Board be bhkedy Gran(h't's
bayonclts ; that the e.fetct to elect
HIyves without votes will thil ! ex
traets frotm leading Northeli n journals
in this week's issue amply testify.
Northern citizens have seen the
lilberties of the citizens of (lour State
cru::shd itandi their Iights overriddet
by (Giant's hivrniidous hlt the intense
indi-inatiou in the North created by
Grant's utnlheard of ordler shows con -
clsivtilyv they will not tamely submit
to this outrage themselves. The eon
test is now between the Northi and
Grant : the latter will go down.
Shall it be war or Tilden ?

Kello_n says that the repuhl.ieans
have enarried this State-it-you count
outthe I)emocratic parishes, and he
wants somne one to coime down froni
the North and exatnimue for them
selves how the radicals have been
abused.
We were of the opinion that two
Congressional ('m imittees, both re
publican, had given Kellogg quite
enough of "Northern men ,otning
down here" to look into his style of
running the governmetnt ofthis State.
Kellogg's "ifs" are like what the Trib
une says of the Radical organs North-
"if they could have east votes enough"
Hlayes would have heen elected. Not
doing that, sensible people and honest
people cannot see wherein he is elect

THE VINDICATOR.
After the war of politics, and when
the lately coIltending hosts are tlhei
one shouting over victory anid th
other routed f'rot del'at, tihe VINDII
(CAT'lR leing of thi winners, calls
atten'lltion to itself.
Owing to the small income of the
lapelr, we will hie compelled to cut
down expenses to the lowest figlure,
and our first step will he the issue
from this to the 1st of January, of a
II.ALF SHEET.
Then we must insist upon the pay
ment to us of all that is due, and tl.e
amoiint* in the nggreg.ate is coisid
eralle.
Nearly all who owe us owe small
a olll(ullts 111111 are apt to say, that
"its only a dollar or two, and I'll pay
u!) at any time." Now, three or four
hund(red people are just in the same
condiitiin, and the aggrlegate amount
would he to us six or seven hutndred
dollars.
Let every noan who owes ns a dol
lar come ii'p and pay at once. It
rnist he dohne, o'r else we will Ihe colm
pell'd to resort to the law, much as
we deplore it.
After the 1tst of January we will go
on with the publication of the VIN

An Honest Count Demanded
lPhiladelphia, Nov. 10.-The New
York Tribune says : Iet it be borne in
mi ind, in the intense moments o(f this
waiting' for the final results :; the
lPresidential election, that there. is
one thing of vastly more illportanl(
Sto the peolple of this cllUntry tha:n
i the choice of either of these two can
tlidates or thie success of either party,
anld that is, that whoever is declaredl
Selected shaill be honestly el'ectld.
I Neither Gov. Tilhten nor' Gov. |laye.,'
Scan afforid to b' declahed elected, or
take the offlice of President of the
4 United States, unless hlie has been
fairly and legally chosen by honest
I ballots and anu honliest count. More
I tlhan this, no private citizen can af
2 tord to have, at such a time ais this,
Sany tall1eriug with ballots or returns.
SThe Tribune's habit is to speak
plain. Theru is already a great deal
of loose tall;, not in the pool rooms
anid tile ward coinnittee rooms, but
higher illp and aong -)ronine)t in
fluentiail men of both Iartites, of elect
inig one or thle other of these two can
didates by doctoring the returns in
7 some of the Southein States. The
talk itself of this is shamieful, that
without openly saying so, suggests
doing that which would be a crime
3 against free government, and tile Tri
iNeC here and now protests against it.
Let partisanship cease for a Imoment,
and all honest citizens unite in tile
ldemiand for an hIlonest count and
honest declaration of the vote.

Tilden's Election.
Philadelphi:a, Nov. 10, 10:50 p. m.
The New lYork Herald this morning
says: "Itf tile Democrats have car
ried Louisiana, the people will not
allow Gov. Kellogg and MIr. Packard,
with a too convenient Returning
Board, to kuklun the vote; they
were allowed to do it in 1872, so far
as tile result had only a local imupor
tance, but tile Senate refused to ad
mit thle Senator elected by their
tirauds. They did it again in 1874,
I bt public opinion forced a Republi
) canl Congress to condemn the fraud in
the tmost positive and conspicuous
manner by unseating some of the
memblers of tile Legislature who were
kukluxed in by the Returning Board.
We beg the New Orleans Repnbhlcan
managers to remember that their plre
vious frauds are well known here in
thIe North, and that as men already
Sdetected and exposed in kukluxing
election returnis, they hIlave a need to
be conspicuously fair and upright
this time. All tlheir acts and pro
ceedings will be watched with tlhe
most jealous eyes by honorable men
of both parties in the North, and
they slhould remlember that tile pIre
sumption lies fairly against tiiem bc
cause they have already been detect
ed in the same trick of which tlhey
are now suspected."
Forney's Press says: "We tieat
our readers precisely as if MIr. Tilden
was elected. Even at thie worst, the
National Congress is practically
a,,ain.t hin. Thle Illouse may be
l)cnlocratic by five or ten, the Selnate
i i c rtlaiinily i l'lic an ill bll y six or1
;iglit. No such spectacle lias ever
been known efore. Here collies
Tilhen, still supposing he has been
choeil, with the S(elinate against hiiii
and Ia House so close that it will re
