SOMETHING ABOUT
DIAMONDS
Every one interested
should know. Do you
know---every one should
know---that dealers in

$90 per carat he can sell
them at a profit for $106

Passenger Arsoelation Consolidation.
New York, Aug. 14.-An attempt
will be made to consolidate the South
western, the Western and the Tranecor'- 1
tinental Passenger associations. The t
reason assigned fir such action is that r
through the financial rearrangement of
the ownership of the various lines com
prising these associations, the existence
of so many bodies, composed practically
of the same men, involves an unneesia
ry expense. By consolidating these as
sociations a material saving could be
be effected. Another reason is stated P
to an easier settltuent of disputes, rate 5S
matters and other affairs by one associ- h
ation than could be accomplished by t(
two or more associations uovering partly o0
the same ground. It is understood that d
the higher -traffic officials favor this a
plan. _1
