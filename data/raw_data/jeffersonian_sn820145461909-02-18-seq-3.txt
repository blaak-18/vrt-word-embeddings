The Son of a Wan With Drains
By 'Ernest Pojle.
OUNG Mr. Riggs was
the son of a man with
brains. The man with
brains had used them well,
down in the Wall Street
world, and had recently
died, leaving a tidy for
tune behind 'him. And his
son and heir, becoming the
1 1 *
head of the family, grew suddenly sol
emn, impressive, severe. Over his of
fice desk he eyed the world with
shrewd, conscientious, conservative
eyes.
One morning*a card was brought in
bearing the name of Tipton. ‘‘ I once
did work for your father,” was
scrawled hastily under the name.
Some moments later a quiet little
man, with an open frank kindly face,
was ushered in.
“Mr. Riggs,” he said at once, “of
course I know* you are busy.” The
son of a man with brains looked busy.
“So I shall be brief. The plan I sub
mit is simple. Here it is.” He lean
ed forward and spoke low. “My
father, who is dead, had a chum —a
mining engineer, who is now slowly
dying, in his rooms at the Manhattan
hotel. He owns five hundred shares in
the C — and L — Mining company.
These shares dropped two years ago
from ninety-three to ter. Six months
ago they had a boom, and since then
they’ve jumped to a hundred and
twenty. But the old man —doesn’t —
know it. Alone in the world, for
years sick in bed, his mind has grown
weak, he never looks at a paper—just
dreams of old times in the West. I
am his only visitor; the son of his old
chum. He likes me, trusts me. That
is all. I don’t ask you to take my
word for anything. I have a cab wait
ing. I want you to come with me
to see him, buy a few shares; then
come with me and sell them. It can
all be done within an hour. And then
we’ll talk business. My commission
is ten per cent.”
The son of a man with brains ask
ed many uneasy conscientious ques
tions, but at last decided to go.
“By the way,” said Tipton, as
they started, “you need cash.. He
is cranky about checks —even with
me. ”
Riggs drew five hundred dollars.
Twenty minutes later they stood in
a handsome, quiet hotel corridor. At
Tipton’s soft knock, a trained nurse
opened the door. In the little parlor
a solemn, frock-coated physician was
scanning the nurse’s report. On see
ing Tipton, he smiled approvingly.
“Come again to cheer him up a bit,
eh* He has just come out of a doze.
Go in.”
In the bed room, propped up on
three pillows, they found him —a deli
cate, feeble old gentleman, his cheeks
hollow and grey from long suffering.
But on sight of Tipton, his faded blue
eyes twinkled.
“Well, young un,” he said, “fresh
and dudish as ever, I see. What’s the
fun today?”
“No fun,” laughed Tipton. “Busi
ness —of the fattest kind —for you !
Here’s a friend of mine, Mr. Riggs,
who wants to buy twenty-five of those
shares of yours — at twenty each!”
As the old man with a low cry started
up out of the pillows, Tipton smiled
kindly. “Yes, sir, they’ve gone up.”
He motioned Riggs to draw back; he
leaned over the bed and ‘his voice sank
to an earnest whisper, of which Riggs
could hear only snatches. “Always
been your chum —better trust me —
sell before it drops again.”
The feeble invalid fell suddenly
back in the pillows; and his face
stared up bewildered and twitching.
“'Pretty sudden, my boy—pretty
sudden for an old hulk like me! Yes
—l’ll sell—l’ll sell.” His breath
came hurried and uneven. His bony
'hands fumbled nervously. “I’ll sell,”
he repeated. From under- his pillow
he drew a bunch of keys; and as Tip
ton unlocked a. trunk in the corner,
drew out a tin box and unlocked it —
the old man smiled. “I never hoped
for such luck,” he chuckled.
Riggs cursed Tipton—under his
breath —but bought the shares.
“Now,” said Tipton, down in the
cab. “Now for the test.”
In a huge building near Wall street
they entered a large and prosperous'
office, with typewriters clicking, clerks
at desks, messenger boys coming in
and out —headquarters of the C —and
L — Mining company. They went in
to the room of the third vice-presi
dent. He looked up annoyed, as they
entered; but when Tipton quickly ex
plained their business, the man’s face
flushed eagerly. Then he grew cau
tious.
“Why, yes,” he said, slowly.
“We’ll give you a hundred and twen
ty. ’ ’ He examined the papers, started
slightly, kept silence. “By the way,”
he said at last, “do you mind telling
me where you got them?”
“From my father, who is dead,”
said Tipton promptly.
“You —have more?”
“A few.”
“Well,” the vice-president yawned.
“Better bring ’em to us. Can’t tell
what’ll happen these days. Stocks
have tumbled.”
Ten minutes later Riggs had his
three thousand dollars. Outside in the
hall they looked at each other.
“He seemed kind of eager, didn’t
he?” asked Tipton, with a grin. Riggs
drew a deep breath.
“Yes, he did.”
Tipton started off.
“Here,” cried Riggs. “What’s
wrong?” The other turned and
sneered:
“My scheme nets twenty-five hun
dred dollars. I get only two hundred
and fifty.” His voice was husky with
excitement. “I’m off to find someone
who’ll give me a bigger share, that’s
all.”
“But hold on! Do I look like a
man to skin anyone?” Riggs stopped
and colored slightly. “How about
twenty per cent?”
“Won’t do,” said Tipton, sharply.
“You’ll have to make it thirty.”
Riggs hesitated.
“All right. Come on.”
“Remember,” said Tipton in the
cab. “The old man won’t take checks.
You must show him the money.
Counting in my commission, yon need
$23,750 —in cash,” and as he saw
Riggs wince, he added in sharp, low
tones, ‘ 1 There isn’t any time to waste.
He excited now. He may send out for
o>be Jeffersonian.
then it’s all up. So if you don’t want
to do it, say so, and I’ll get someone
who will!”
Riggs went to his bank and drew
the money—in twenty-four crisp, tight
packets. On the way to the hotel,
neither spoke.
“By Jove,” muttered Riggs, “I
hate to do it!” And he looked in
disgust at this companion. Tipton
looked surly.
“Who loses?” he growled. “The
old man has no friends, no relations.
Won’t ten thousand last him two
months? The doctor says he can’t live
longer. ’ ’
Oh! ’ ’ The reputable young man’s
face relaxed. “Why didn’t you tell
me that sooner?”
“Because,” said Tipton with a
grin, “I didn’t think I had to.”
Riggs glared and they drove on in
silence.
At the hotel, the nurse said her pa
tient had sunk into a stupor. She
kept them waiting for over an hour
—till Riggs grew very nervous. Sud
denly he rose.
“Can t you give him a stimulant?”
he asked, sharply. The nurse looked
at him a moment. She had rather a
hard face.
“You seem to be very anxious,”
she said. “Is it worth so—very
much?”
“It won’t do him any harm, will
it?”
“No—. No harm—. Is it worth
so much?”
With a slow look of disgust, young
Riggs took out a ten dollar bill and
laid it on-the mantel. The nurse smil
ed.
.The patient was roused, and seemed
dazed. Rut Tipton’s soft, cheery
voice, and then the sight of the crisp
yellow bills which they tumbled in a
loose pile all over the bed—seemed to
clear his mind. His eyes gleamed and
his hands trembled. His hurried ques
tions were childish and easily an
swered. And the transaction was soon
effected—47s shares for $9,500.
Riggs threw himself into the cab,
and leaned back and closed his eyes.
His face set tight, in remorse. Tip
ton nudged him.
What do you want?’’ asked Riggs
savagely.
“Fourteen thousand, two hundred
and fifty.”
Riggs opened his eyes.
i ‘ Oh, no! Not yet. ’ ’
“Oh, yes! You are safe; you have
seen the office; your money i s wait
ing—But what security have I?
Either you settle right here now
or I go to the C— and L— office and
tell the whole yarn. That wouldn’t
be nice, would it?”
The son of a man with brains—
thought a long time. The cab rattled
on.
“Well? ’ asked Tipton, impatient
ly, “which do you choose?”
Riggs jerked out the money.
“Now,” he said, contemptuously,
“you ‘trusted chum’ of an old man,
would you mind leaving me to my
self?”
Not at all,” said Tipton, cheerily,
stopping the cab. “Just what I was
about to suggest. ’ ’ He got out. 1 ‘Glad
to have done you a service, Mr.
