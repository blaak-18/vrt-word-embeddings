THE CAMPAIGN.
v
The candidates of the White Peo
pie's Party have made a thorough
canvass of the Parish, and at many
of the most important points, have
addressed large numbers ot our fel
low citizens. Every where they
have teen met with a cordial wel
come, and at every point the people
have exhibited great enthusiasm in
their cause, which was in the great
est degree encouraging. The white
people of Rapides are now thor
oughly alive upon the great issue
and each one feels the responsibili
ty resting upon liitn as au individu
al co-worker, in the grea cause.—
It is true that we have a few lag
gards, louts and croakers, but the
tidal wave will bear them on for a
while, and then if they fail in their
duty the just ind gnation of a peo
ple w ho are battling for every thing
near and dear, will brand them us
cowards and traitors.
There are various ways by which
men can injure us who are un
it ieudly to the cause, and who are in
the interest of the Radical party. —
But the most plausible, the most
insinuating, and at the same tima
the most effective way, is by at
tempting on all occasions to throw
a damper oil the feelings of those
around them,and trying to convince
them that our cause is hopeless,
and all our efforts vain. This class
of political enemies are greatly to
lie feared as one of them can do more
harm decidedly than ten open ene
mies. A man that is on all occa
sions prophesying defeat, is expres
sing only a wish that it may be so.
Beware theu, of this class ot secret
emissaries, drive them away, and
listen not to their false prophecies.
There is only a few men belonging
to this class, for in all parts of the
parish the greatest confidence and
enthusiastic determination to carry
the election, seems to pervade the
mass of the people. The patriotic
voters of the l'ine Woods on both
sides of the Red River, are united
almost to a man, and what few are
not yet registered, will do so before
the election, and we may safely
count on a full vote for the white
people's ticket in the Pine Woods.
So far then, the canvass has been
entirely satisfactory and our can
didates have made the very best
impressions on all occasions. They
are able, honest and determined
men, worthy of the support of any
party or class of people. They have
inspired confidence in the minds of
all, and from what we hear, a large
number of colored voters will give
to them their cheerful support.—
There is a great deal of work to bo
done yet, before the election, and
particularly to keep alive the inter
est and enthusiasm of the people,
to inspire courage and fortitude in
the hearts of the weak and falter
ing. Let the candidates continue
in the good work, let every one do
his duty, and success is certain.

We request the attention of
onr readers to the notice of the
Butchers at the Market House, pro
posing to sell beet at 8 cents per lb
and obligating themselves to keep it
down to that, price. They deserve to
be supported at this price, as no one
should desire them to sell fot any
thing less than a living price. We
are assured by them that this is the
very lowest figure at which they can
make anything, and we now suggest
to Mr. Calvit to put his price up to
that, figure, and let. him who sells the
best beef get the mos? custom. This
arrangement would be fair all around
and we would like to see the matter
arranged upon this basis.
The Live Stock Journal —
This is a popular and deserving
monthly periodical published in
New York city, at $1.50 per year.
It is a Jourual which every farmer
should have as it treats of an incer
est we desire to see developed here
to the fullest extent, the rearing
and care for all kinds of live stock.
Mr. E. Vallery is the ageut at this
place and will be pieased to send

The white people are not ignor
ant of the evil designs ot the lead
ers of tlte Radical party, who pro
pose to collect the negro voters
from all parts ot the Parish on the
day ot election at Alexandria. If
the leaders in this dark move of
iniquity imagine that we are asleep,
we will try and convince them,
that their nefarious purposes con
cocted, as they may beat midnight,
in secreted places, and around a
dark lantern, are not unknown' to
us. The scales have long sii.ee
fallen from our eyes, and we will
faithfiAly watch and expose the
schemes ot fraud, that have already
been so exultingly cftncocted.
The white people demand a fair
election, and they have the courage
atid manhood to see that there is
one. The five or six petty poten
tates of the Radical party in this
patish, need not imagine that they
can again surreptitiously steal into
power and lord it over a people
: that have already, beyond ineas
jure, submitted to their wicked
usurpation. The people do not
. propose that the Paish of Rapides
j at least, shall longer submit to the
I disgraceful rule of a few white
j men, renegades from society, whose
public acts of immorality, and
j known vices, are such as to pre
clude them from a return to vir
tue—and who lor the last several
years have been making the wealth
of the parish a source of their
graudeur, while the impoverished
white people, of all classes, have
been made the victim of their vices.
Few in number, they have beeu en
i abled to divide the spoils of office
j satisfactorily among themselves,
I remain united, and thereby control
J the ignorant horde of negroes,
making theui the unconscious in
jstruinents of our ruin, and degra
, dation.
The negro is not so much to
blame, and let alone, would soon
find his level, and become perhaps
'ait useful element ot society. If
therefore, the negroes are instrnct
1 ed to assemble at Alexandria, from
all parts of the Parishon the day
j of election, let the white people
I from the whole palish be prepared
; to meet them, and should any
ifraud b* attempted,or disturbance
I threatened, let the leaders alone
then made lespousiblc, ami suffer
j that punishment, at the hands
|an outraged people that they so
justly merit. Watch ! Wait ! and

are wanting in that determination
that solemn, serious earnestness,

well known fact that over one half
of the property holders in this Par

exacted In the way of taxation, to
the Radical cormorants. And
should the Tax gatherer enforce
strictly the law, over one half of

Rapides, would be homeless in less
than sixty days. Let the Radical
party succeed, and the taxes will
be collected to the last dollar, or
the iauds be forfeited to the State,
to be parceled out to your enemies.
If the White People's Ticket suc

We give below a it attract from a
lengthy address of colored peo
plè in Pew Orleans. It is a very
significant document, and exhibits
the fact that the colored people, or
at least their leaders,^e beginning
to awake to the conviction that
their carpet bag allies have used
them merely as tools—and that
there is a deeply seated distrust
pervading their ranks. The lead
ing colored men are to blame some
what, for the present condition of
afiairs in Louisiana, and they at
last perceive that it is to the inter
est of their race, and the common
good of all to make alliances with
t'e white people of Louisiana. The
following extract contains: '

We print in fnll the following editor*
i«l from Harper'$ Weekly. Emanating
from the leading Administration paper
in the contry, it may be regarded as
extremely significant :
the president and Louisiana.
Notwithstanding all lira sharp cen*
sure ol the President in many onarters
for Iiis »riüinal recognition of Kellogg
in bmisiiinii, his duty in the late event*
ws* pref ?thr plain. It waa to suppress
the revolntioii promptly and peremp*
torily. îhe bifeWfcftftrt Wat evident
was tlnrt wv were mfÉbo#HrltV tbs
beginning of a Mexican method in nor
politic*. Had it received the slightest
countenance, or any rldng hntÜHi short
and summary summons of CMp. vpint,
with Hiejnstant movement of troops,
Tlie doctrine of "honte rnlsf liight
iv* ptvpleftei a Ypss'spnnd heed than
wt M the victor over ''liotnfc Tnle" or
ga ni fed as secession and rebellion;
while the telegrams sent to Washington
by Penn and variona tarife« 1n New
Orleans argued , gravely that because
not many officers of the law had been
killed, the insnrrecthm should be
acknowledged. lé tlii» Rhode Island
ruse Dorr allowed an ütMlinpnted ma*
jo rity of voters in favor, of his const i
tiMion, but the whole proceeding waa
irregular, and the Administration did
not hesitate to sustain the actual Qov*
ernor
The situation in Louisiana lias be*»
moat wretched ; but let the President
lie judged by the facta. After the el
ect ion in 1872 Inith Kellogg and
McEnery claimed to lie Governor, and
two Legislature« assumed to Im valid.
Appeal waç made to the President, but
lie declined to intefere until resistance
wa« made to judicial process.
The Hi «aident says, nor is there any
reason to suppose that lie deliberately
tells a falsehood in a state paper, tha 't
he did not think that he had any right
lo revie«.the judgment of the'court.
This seems to as a most aérions error,
not only liecanse the Constitution in
the view of the Supreme Conrt makes
him the sole judge, but because under
the act of 187ÏI he waa made responsi
ble for using the whole foicë of the
Uni' n, and it was clearly his duty not
to ose it outil he was satisfied that it
ought to tie used. Under the circum
stances, the j'ld-.'inentofa conrt should
not have satisfied him. But there ia
no doubt that he acted in prefect good
taith. The court* have decided the
Lynch returning twuird to be lawful,
and action lieing imperative, the Presi
dent recognize«] Kellogg.
This lie did. so far as has been shown,
with entiie honesty, and the pi oof of
it is that when further investigation
developed eveiy kind of fraud, and
threw the whole question into the ut
most niicei tniuty. he referred the who!»
question to Congress, stating frankly
that if it did nothing he should wdher«
to the government that he had already
recognized. Congress declined to act,
not withstanding Iii« urgent request,
and its refusal was regarded by him s»
a virtual approval of his action. From
that moment, obliged to consider on*
of the contestants as Governor, ho giia
tnined Kellogg; and an inMirrection a
gaiiiftthe Kclioog administration was
•' tin-domestic violence" »gainst which
the United States gtia rati tees every
State. Meanwhile a committee of Cou»
.•less repotted, after in relitigation, that
Kellojjg had not l>ee» lawfully elected,
biitCoiiijicss refiisd to order a new elec
tion. It has been a wretched business
Itoiu the beginning, f»>r which Congress
is mniiity responsible. But the Mexi
can solution sought by the McEnery
men u:;d it e White League made it
only worse, and it, has been most sati*
t'actorilt trnd promptly disposed of.
Of corse the only remedy is an honest
election; but Kellogg liolda his otliico
for two years more. The President,
we presume, will not insist upon Con
giessional attention to Louisiana. lie
may justly icniind Congress that Iiis
previous message was not uncalled for.
And as even he, who recognized Kel
loyg. presently said that it. was doubt
ful whether he were elected, and as
the Congressional Committee declared
that he was not elected, and as the in
Kimection has clmnii how slight a pop
ular suppoit he has, it may be quite
worth while to consider whether there
is nothing to do for Louisiana but to
uphold a Go» eiior w hom nobody be
lieves to have been elected, ami who
is apparently sustained solely by the
national power.
ty President Porter, of Yale
gave the following advice to the
students of that institution, the
other day: >
•'Young men, yon are the archi
tects of your own fortunes. Rely
upon your own strength of body
and soul. Take for your star seif
rel.ance. Inscribe on your own
banner, "Luck is a tool, Pluck is a
hero." Don't take too mncli advice
keep at your own helm and steer
your own ship, and remember that
the great art of commanding is to
take a fair share of work. Think
well of yourself. Strike ont. As
«nine your own position. Put po
tatoes iu a cart over a rough road»
ami the small ones go to the bot
tom. Rise above the envious and
jealous. File above the mark you
intend to hit. Energy, invincible
determination, with the right mo
tive, are the levers of the world.-r
Don't Drink. Don't chew. Don't
