Old Nat Banks lived on Big Terra
pin Creek. Had he been as much no
ted for industry as he was noted on
account of a disposition to dodge ac
tive work, he would have taken a po
sition in the front rank of Terrapin
Creek agriculture, but, as it was, he
occupied the unenvied position of
crop thermometer —that is, when he
had a fair crop, it was generally be
lieved that all of the other crops in
the neighborhood were of unusual ex
cellence. Old Nat was a widower. It
was once cruelly hinted at Webster’s
watermill that Mrs. Banks had been
starved to death, but the inhumanity
of this reproach will be recognized
when I solemnly affirm that the old
lady, on the day before she was strick
en with her fatal illness, was seen
fondly hovering over a large stew
pan full of cold potatoes and wild
mustard. Old Banks’ daughter, a girl
of seventeen, would have been the
belle of the community had her fath
er’s farm been in better condition. In
oppositiin to the advice of people
more intelligent than himself, he had
burdened the girl with the name of
Anthracite. He had heard the word,
in a vague sort of way, and was much
struck with it, declaring that a girl
with such a name could not help mar
rying a lawyer, or a circuit rider with
a good nag and a new saddle. Bill-
Dick Belsher, a sort of “harum
scarum” young fellow of the neigh
borhood, had fallen in love with An
thracite, and had asked her to marry
him, which, as there was nothing- bet
ter in sight, she had consented to do.
Bill-Dick, dressed in a suit of cordu
roy —which, indeed, was the wardro
bial wonder if nearly every young
man in the community—had called at
the house and asked for the girl, when
the old man denounced him, as above'
set forth.
“Oh,” the old man continued, “I
know all about your clothes, but you
don’t know nothin’ about law, an’,
besides that, whar’s your nag an’ new
saddle? Anthracite kain’t afford to
throw herself away on a common man,
’specially one that ain’t no more ac
count than you air, Bill-Dick Bel
sher.”
“You are a fine man,” Bill-Dick
replied, “to be talkin’ ’hout a nusson
bein’ no account. W’y. eadfound
your ugly pictur’, Nat Banks, you are
too lazy to bresh a hoss-fly offen your
nose in August, an’ you ain’t more’n
got sense enough to grunt when a pain
strikes you. Mont live two hundred
years, Nat Banks, an’ you couldn’t
have a suit of clothes like these here.”
“You wouldn’t have ’em es you
hadn’t found ’em summers,” the old
man replied; “but that ain’t nuther
here nur thar; you ain’t goin’ to
marry Anthry, an’ that clinches it”

By Ophie 'Read
“S’pose we run away?”
“S’pose I foiler you?”
‘‘ S ’pose you kain’t ketch us ? ”
“S’pose lead ken?”
The reference to lead had its effect.
“Come, old man,” said Bill-Dick,
“don’t come talkin’ about shootin’ a
feller.” *
“Ain’t said a word about shoot
in’.”
“No, but eadfound your ugly pic
tur’, that’s whut you meant. You
must recolleck you ain’t got more’n
enough sense than to shoot these
clothes full of holes.”
clothes full of holes.”
“Wall, then, go on away, an’ find
a man that won’t shoot, an’ marry
his gal. That’s about the safest way
for you to do.”
“Never mind, old man; I’ll git
even with you.”
“Yes, the turkey gobbler got even
with the mus’rat.”
“An’,” said Bill-Dick, “mebbe the
coon didn’t get even with the craw
fish.”
“He mout a done it,” replied the
old man, “but he got his skin power
ful wet.”
“That’s all right, but he eat the
crawfish. Well, I must go, but I’ll
see you agin.”
'Several weeks later, during an over
flow, Bill-Dick sought the
old man and excitedly exclaimed:
“Say, Mr. Banks, I don’t kere how
much I’ve got agin a man, I kain’t
b’ar to see his dumb brutes suffer.
Three of the best hogs you’ve got air
out on an'islan’ in the creek, an’ es
you don’t go airter ’em the water’ll
sweep ’em off in another ha’f hour.”
“My stairs, you don’t say so, Bill-
Dick!”
“Didn’t you hear me say so? Es
you didn’t I’ll say it agin.”
“Os cou’se I hearn you, but what
am I to do?”
“Go airter ’em.”
“How?”
“I’ve got a boat down yander.”
“Will you let me take it?”
“I’ll go out with you.”
While they were rowing toward the
island, Bill-Dick said: “Old man, you
mout let me have Anthry, airter I
have dun been so ’commerdatin’?”
“Bill-Dick, whar’s your nag an’
new saddle? Whar’s your law
books? Bein’ ’commerdatin’ is one
thing, an’ givin’ up a gal is another.”
“Hon out,” said Bill-Dick, when
the boat touched the island. The old
man jumped out, and Bill-Dick, shov
ing off into deep water, caught hold
of a sapling to hold the boat steady,
and said:
“How do you feel, old man?”
“All right. Say, row her in, an’
le’s git the hogs. Come on, for the
water is risin’ powerful fast.”
“What hogs?”
“W’y, dog my cats, my hogs—the
ones you said was out here.”
“Old man, yon ain’t got no hogs
out here. I was jest a-jokin’ with
you.”
“That ain’t no joke, Billie. Come
up an’ let me git back into the boat.”
“No, I reckon you’ll have to swim
out.”
dje Jeffersonian
“W’y, man, I kain’t swim a lick.”
“Then I reckon it’ll far’ bad with
you, Good-by. ’ ’
“For ther Law’s sake, hold on,
Billie.”’
“Would, but you see I ain’t got
time. Got to go an’ marry a gal
that’ll soon be a orfun.”
“Wush I had my gun,” said the
old man.
“Stay here till I fetch it.”
“Blame your infernal lyin’ hide, I
could shoot the top of your head off.”
“Blaze away.”
“Nevr mind. I’ll git you yit, Bill-
Dick/’
“Not in this here world. Say, do
you obsarve how peart the water is
risin ’ ? ”
“Oh, Lawd!” supplicated the old
man, “whut am I to do?”
“Ride out on your nag and new
saddle,” replied Bill-Dick.
“You blame lunatic, don’t you see
I ain’t got none?”
“Then float out on your law
books. ’ ’
“Come, now, Billie, would you see
your ole friend —a friend that nussed
you when you was a little boy—
drowned this way?”
“No, Uncle Nat.”
“Thar, now, I didn’t think you
would, Billie.”
“I couldn’t stand to see you
drowned, so I’ll go away so I kain’t
see it.”
“Oh, you wretch!” the old man
howled “You ought to be dead.”
“You will be putty soon.”
“W’y, you pore fool, don’t you
know that Anthry wouldn’t marry a
man that has drowned her pore, hard
workin’ father?”
“I’ll tell her that you fell in the
water.”
“.She won’t believe you.”
“Yes, she will, fur I’ve dun told
her that I wouldn’t be s’prised if you
didn’t fall in.”
“Oh, you unfeelin’ wretch!”
“Yes, that’s whut the circuit-rider
said.”
“You ain’t got no more soul than
a buffalo-gnat, Bill-Dick.”
“That’s whut the lawyer said.”
“Hold on thar, now!” Bill-Dick
had begun to row away. “Say, Bil
lie.”
“Wall.”
“Tell you whut I’ll do.”
“Nominate your pizen.”
“You know that I have had my eye
on your sister Tildy for some time.”
“Which eye?” *
“Blame it, both of ’em.”
“Wall, whut es you have?”
“W’y, jist this: Es you’ll git her
to marry me, I’ll give you Anthry.”
Bill-Dick hesitated a moment and
then replied:
“All right.”
“Shore pop?” asked the old man.
“Shore pop,” Bill-Dick replied.
11.
Old Miss Tildy lived with her broth
er. She was a “finiky” old maid,
with a wisp of hair that • jsembled a
bunch of sedge grass. She was such
an enemy to man in general that Bill-
Dick, as he walked toward home, re-
gretted that he had not exacted easier
terms from old Banks. When he en
tered the house old Miss Tildy was
putting a plate full of corn-bread on
the table.
“Jist in time,” she said. “Fetch
up a cheer.”
Bill-Dick sat down, wondering how 7
he should proceed. “Tildy,” said he,
“I hearn a man compliment you
mighty high today.”
“Who was it?” she eagerly asked.
“One of the nicest gentlemen in
this country; Mr. Nat Banks.”
“He’s an old fool!” she snapped.
“I hate him, an’ he better not fool
’round me.”
“Oughtn’t talk that way, sis.”
“Yes, I will talk that way, an’
more’n that, he better never come
whar I am. I’d throw b’ilin water
on him in a minit.”
Bill-Dick’s heart sank, and, deep in
his soul, he cursed himself for making
such a contract with old Banks. Now
his last chance was gone, for he knew
that never again could he place the
watchful fellow 7 under such contribu
tion. Suddenly an encouraging idea
occurred to him.
“Tildy,” said he, assuming an air
of most complete satisfaction, “you
don’t know how much good your
