the payments had no cause of com- c
plaint. In 1874, another colnpromise ii
wakeffected, the understanding was
that' the Democrats were to have c
picked orit two Police Jurors, and ii
the Republicans two, and the other
one by Gov. Kellogg. There were h
tgly five Police Jurors appointed. rr
Two were picked out by the Demo- tl
crate and two by the Repunblicans and I
the ,fifth man, a colored man, was a
picked out by the Democrats and b
commissioned uqder the agreement. b
This man did not serve. This agree- a
ment gave them every facility and tl
control of the Board. 'The great li
item of the trouble with them seems I
to be the question of taxation. The n
real part of which I expect to show p
to the contrary, net only from Re- t
pablican, hut also. from Democratic C
swurces. There is a 'State law per p
mTittibg pesoas who h. ave claims e
again4t the parish to ste Miid obtain e
Judgmenets. The' Judge is require i
to allow the. Assessor to assesbs a Cer I

perty in the parish to pay those .otg- to
ments. A large aotbunt of warrants gl
havdr4been' ieaed in the parish of d
Natchitoches. The only time the n
Republicans were in control of the ti
parish government was in 1870. They c
served their time out which expired a
in November, 1872. In 1871, an in. a

criminal expenses, some of them arose 1e
in that way. Si
Q. Did the Court of your parish de
cost more than that of any other plar- It
isl for the same duration f hi
A. No, sir, prior to 1870, in fact, bt
before the war, some of these war- lit
rants had been issued promiscuously; ai
there were plenty of them on the tI
matiket. Somue of thenm were dated
as far back as 1859; they were for 18
building a Courhause; they were hi
bought lip and sued on in 1874, with eli
an immense amount of initerest upon di
them. I lhave already stated that ia 18
meeting of the tax-payers was called. pa
I suspected that the object of that th
meeting was not alone called for the 18
purpose of reducing taxation, bnut to
that it was for some political move. an
One week before this meeting took ce
place a list of twelve tax-payers call- do
ed upon the Police Jury to reduee the of
I odinarj .tx two per citt, which had
I been IlviTil by a formes Police Jury, th
10 Mi8ls. Trie )~arney tax was re- Ii
pealed, and the 'school tax reduced, ea
so that every. thing wais reduced be- Di
lfore the. meeting took.place. hnme- TI
diately after the adjournment of the is
Imeeting, the White I ague organista- ef
tion began to form; this meeting was ce
called for the f5th of July, an article 'ma
appeared in the paper, and at the
same time that notice appeared on th
I the 27th. I refer to the article in Nl
the (Natchitoehes Vindicator.) You le,
mnost bear in mind that the taxes were pa
reduced at least before the meeting:; u
I -was sick that week the meeting th
took place. I laid there in my bed is
two or three weeks' before the meet- lei
ing took plate. A friend came to see de
me and said that they intended to th
umake the Republicans resign, and jf pii
they would not resign, they weald am
kill'the'n. ' ''" wi
A id my 'wif i sait etaom although ap
the little, ;baby' ;i: a* the. poidt of pt
death ; although your fatbp .is d ".
ing at thie other end of totwn, would dE
rathesr you would go away stud I In- $(
suit upqon your going'a-way, .,o at le
five, o'clock that evening .1, got off di
my .ick bed and took a little sat
chlel. A Democrat of Natchitoches, de
*whem Ic'onsider a good elnservative fo
nams asid a friend of minel told. me;
"yoii must go away, it is n~ safe for. to
you to renmalo Isey.. I wil 'lend you
myf boggy t6i go'as \ as y6tihave to
Igoto tget.ab bt." I excepted 'mtheio- to
I vi atina,ad left atalp outive o'clock a
yip the.eveuin. . , p pdeabout twenty, 18
miles. It is a tio sh glar fact that It
that the momeT"I'i atrived at Mr.
Wolfie's door kid.told hini who I an
was, 'he come and said to tee, "hash,
you are saf here, there is no dauger, ?I
here. ". 1di inot want to say I was at
I'eFimg the' parish, and I said what ai
r d yoea meant He said, "I nnderstand is
it ll,. you will be safe here." How as
ihe knew about it, I cannot tell. I staid ti
at his house all night, and the next yi
" day I reached Coushatta. and remain- id
led about two hiours when I took a ca
sateanmer for Sh 'eveport. I was told
lit was imposs ble togo down the pm
Iriver. I 'proceeded around by way
! of Memphis an< thence to New Or- ec
'leans. When I arrived here, I got a
letter from my wife and the imprint ti,
of her tears were plainly visible upon iI
f the sheet. She said that the lit- i
itle child had died the neit day after of
I had left and that there was not a m
er sul that would go there to help her cl
I dress it. My father died two days af
Sterwards. I waslhi only support; I se
iefnsed' to let any society eontribnte pr
' any relief toairds hti support at all. El
I He had been sick foaT, somel time; he qi
' died in my absence. I had not the n
Sconsolatioi of remaining there to b
Iclose his eyes in death. I knew when
SI left hlume he could not live long;
I but I knew it was impossible for me
ito wait that length of time.

the parih of Natlahitoches, the 8tate

for : this lti sttatement eatlhe speial
Sppiah t ex collleated from the Irstoof
i April. 1873 to the ftrt f Dee.mber,
1873, amounting to twelve thousand
six hundred and! forty three 251100
dollar's. From the first of December,
1873, there was forty thousand sit
hnodred and ninety-nine dollars due
by the parish to creditors with a de
linquent tax list of twenty thousand
antid seventy one dollars and seventy
two cents to pay this balance.
Collected on current tax of 1872,
1872, and 1871, nine thousand four
hundred and seventy two dollars sad
eleven cents; leaving a parish tas
dues by the parish in all, January Ist,
1875, of sixty-six thousand dollars,
payable in currency. To pay that
there is a delinquent list of 1878.
1872, 1871, 1870 and 1869, amounting
to sixty-nine thousand seven hundred
and thirty five dollars and sixteen
cents, for some three or four thousand
dollars over the amount required
of the delinquent list was collected.
I have a statement here showing
the amoont paid, and the balance doe.
I suppose it is unnecessary to itemisi
each one. Both the Rlepublicansand
Denmocrats agree on the figures..
The total amount of new judgments
is seven thousand five hundred and
eighty nine dollars and sixty seven
cents. Total $9,472 of new judg
ments.
Now I will state, that in some of
these, for instance in the town of
Natelhitoches, there is no parish tbi
levied. The town is exempt fromes
parish tax; so that persons owning
no property outside of. the city, In
the parish, pay no parish tax. There
is no gentlemen, who represents aly
largo :per centage of this judgienet
debt who pays any parish tax, and
the amount of paper bought up and
pit in judgments is largely over the
amount necessary to pay their eases
'wirh, in pther, words, it is a matter of
spsIulatibn tfor whoever buys the pa.
per to get tiseejudgments.
'ghat is the state of facts, sir, the
,debitf the parish amounts to some
$66,000 and aginqt that the uneol
lected tableau is sufficient to pay the
debt, when collected. ." -
Q. By Mr. Field. What was the.
debt of the parish prior to 1868, he-.
fore this State was reconstructed f

tell.

tempt'thdo that, beeause there was
a large amlount of paper -issued from
1863 to the end of the war, by tb,
prihrf 6 - .
Q. Do you know whether it was a
supall prlarge amount I
'A. I heard it was a large amount.
?Sr this reason, there were a large
namlper of persoas who went in the
army, who left their families behind
them in the parish, and the parish s
sued a quantity of paper to suppoer
these poor families. I eannot tell
you the amount; I have not the least
idea what it was. I don't think is
can be ascertained.

parish during the wart
A. I doubt whether this statemeat'
could be made accurately.

tion of the debt contracted prior ..to
1868, was contracted and issued du
ring Confederate times, for theinsm
of the Confederate a,rmSy, or for the.
use and support of their women and
children ?
A. In 1869 the Police Jury attempt.
ed to biod and fund the debt of the
parish, add issued bonds to take up
this paper. I know there was a
quahltity of this paper like pauper
mloney issued by the parish, sad ais
by the town of Natchitoehes.

Jury?
