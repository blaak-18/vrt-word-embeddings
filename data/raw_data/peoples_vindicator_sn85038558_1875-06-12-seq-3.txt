flames and strong nervous sys

the feeble need not despair.
By adopting the right means,
they may live as long and enjoy
life as much as their more robust
neighbors. Physicial invigora

It is asserted as a fact that every
eanvasser who has turned his atten
tion to the introduction of the New
Family Sewing Machine in his local
ity, or who has been fortunate enough
to secure an agency, has outstripped
the best efforts in making money of
the old and tried Agents of the high
priced machines, which latter they
S'now replace. The demand is enor
monus, and sales so rapid and money
~msde so readily with so little effort
,that Farmers, Tradesmen, Specula
itoep &c., are focking into the busi
,as as fast as they can secure terri
:tory and get their goods on the
ground to supply anxious customers.

WEEKLY AND DAILY FOR 1875
The approach of the Presidential elec
tion gives unusual importance to tile
,venits and developments of 1875. We
shall endeavor to describe them fully,
faithfiully, and fearlessly.
THE WEEKLY SUN has now attain
ed a circulation of over seventy thou.
sand copies. Its readers aid found iin
every State and Territory, and its quali
ty is well known to the public. We
shall not only endeavor to keep it fully
up to the old standard, but to improve
and add to its variety and power.
'IllE WEEKLY SUN will continue to
be a thorough newspaper. All the news
of the day will he found in it, condens.
ed when unimportant, at full length
when of moment, and always, we trust,
treated in a clear, interesting and in.
structive manner.
It is our aim to make the Weekly Sun
the best famlily newspaper in the world.
It will be fuill ot entertaiining and ap
propriate reading of every sort, but will
print nothing to offend the most scrupu
lous and delicate taste. It will always
contain the most interesting stories and
romances of the day, carefully selected
and legibly printed.
The Agricultural Department is a
prominent feature in the Weekly Sun,
and its articles will always be found
fresh and useful to the farmer.
The number of men independent in
politics is increasing, 8a1nd the Weekly
Scn is their paper especially. It belongs
to no party, and obeys no dictation, con
tending for principle, and for the election
of the best men. It exposes the corrup.
tion that disgraces the country and
threatens the overthrow of republican
institutions. It has no fear of knaves,
and seeks no favors from their support
ere.
The markets of every kind and the
fashions are regularly reported in its
columns.
The price of the WEEKLY SUN is one
dollar a year for a sheet of eight pages,
and fifty-six colmans. As this barely
pays expenses of paper and printing, we
are not able to make any discount or al
low any premium to friends who may
make special efforts to extend its circula
tion. Under the new law, which re
quires payment of postage in advance,
one dollar a year, with twenty cents the
cost of prepaid postate added, is the rate
of subscription. It is not necessary to
get up a clubnh in order to have the Week
ly Sun at this rate. Any one who sends
one dollar and twenty cents will get the
paper, post-paid, for a year.
We have no traveling agents.
THE WEEKLY SUN.-Eight pages,
fifty-six columnns. Only $1.20 a year,
postage prepaid. No discount from this
rule.
THE DAILY SUN.-A large four-page
newspaper of twenty-eight columns
Daily circulation over 120000. All the
news for 2 cents. Subscription, postage
prepaid 55 cents a month, or $650 a year.
To clubs of 10 or over, a discount of 20
per cent. Address.

THE
People's Vindicator,
FOR 1875.
We take pleasure in announcing to the
numerous friends of the VINDICTOR,
that we have perfected arrangements for
the continuation of its publication upon
a firm basis. The public are well aware
of the difficulties under which the Con
servative press ot Louisiana labor; the
infamous printing law passed by a parti
nraln Legislature, solely to foster antd up
hold, at the expense of the tax-payers,
journals entirely antagonistieal to their
interest, and at war upon their lib.!rties,
and by forcing, under the forms of law,
our citizens to advertise in these official
papers, to break down their power, the
Conservative and Democratic press; eon
sequently we are compelled to depend
for support upon the generous contribu
tion of a people already poverty-stricken,
but we feel assured that they w'll not
fail to sustain their main power in the
wvar of virtue against vice
The Fearleum White Ian's PrI of
Loauisian.
The futnre tone of this paper ecn be
judged from its past. We will continue
to advoeate to success, the rights of the
TAXED, that honesty and eapability,
ALONE, shall constitute grounds for po
litical pretferment, and a continued and
never eeasing war upon Kellogg and his
corrupt officials--knowing them 'to be'i
common with their Chief, both usurpers
and thieves.
We can assure the public that we will
not hesitate to attack the acts of any po
liteical organization, when we believe
them to be antagonistic to public good.
We are the servant of no clique or party,
and intend solely to protect and defend
the rights mand liberties, in our honest
way, of the whole peoplile-believing that
we lhave done suflicient service in the
cause of the PEOPLE in the past, we
confldently expect their support in the
fnuture.

A Representative and Champion of American
Art Taste !
5 Frospects for 187I--Eighth Tear.
STilE ART JOURNAL OF AMERICA,
ISSUED MONTHLY.
"'A Magnificent Conception, wonderfully
carried out."
. The necessity of a popular medium for
the representation of the productions of
dtr great artists, has always Iwen recog.
nized, and many attempts have been
Snrule to meet the want. The successive
Sfailures which so invarihly followed eo-"h
I atteimpt.in this country to establish an.
art journal, did not prove the inditftr
ence of the people of America to the
claims of high art. gn soon as a proper
appreciation of the want and an ability
to meet it were shown, the publlic at
once rpllied with enthusiasm to its sup
port. and the result was a great artistic
and commercial trinmph-TifE ALl)I\E.
TIlE ALDINE, while issued with all the
regularity. lihas none of the temporary or
timely interest characteristic of ordinary
perioldieals. It is an elegant miscellany
of pure, light and graceful literature; anml
a collection of pictures, the rarest speci-d
mens of artistic skill, in black and white.
Although each succeeding number atords
a fresh pleasure to its friends, the real
valve and heanty of the ALDINE will be
most appreciated after it has heen lumind I
up at the close of time year. While other i
journals may claim snuperior cheapness, as I
compared with r7rals of a similar class, i
the ADINE is a nnique and original conll
caption-alone and unapproached - abso
lutely without compltition in price or I
character. The possessor of a complete
volume cannot duplicate the quantity of i
fine paper and engravings in any other a:
shape or number of volunes for ten times 1
its cost; and then, there is the Chromo I
besides! e
National feature of' THE ALDINE I
must be taken in no narrow srnse. Tre 1
art is cosmopolitan. While THE AL
DINE is a strictly American institution,
it does not confine itself entirely to the t
reproduction of native art. Its mission a
is to cultivate a broad and appreciative v
art taste, one that will discriminate only t
on grounds of intrinsic merit. Thns. t
while placing before the patrons of TlHE
ALPINE, as a leading eharaetcritic, the 3
productions of the most noted American e
artists, attention will *always be given to u
specimens from foreign n:uters, giving a
subscribers all the pleasure and instrue- )
tion obtainable from home or foreign t
sources. I
The artistic illnstrntion of American i
scenery, original with THE ALDINE, is I
an important feature, and its magnificent r
plats are of a size more appropriate to
the satisfattory treatment of details I
than can Ibe afforded by any inferior i
page. The judicious interspersion of 1
landscape, marine, figure, and animal
subjects, sustain an unabated interest, !
impossible where the scope of the work
confines the artist too closely to a single
style of subject. The literature of THE 1
ALPINE is a light and graceful accom
paniment, worthy of the artistic fea
tures, with only such technical disqrisi
tions as do not interfere with the popu
lar interest of the work.
Premium for 1875.
Every subscriber for 1875 will receive
a beautiful portrait, in oil colors, of the
same noble dog whose picture in a for
mer issue attracted so much attention,
"lWAYS UTYNELFISII FRIEND"
will be a welcome in every home. Eve
rybody loves such a dog, and the portrait
is executed so true to the life, that it
seems the veritable presence of the ani
mal itself. The Rev. T. De Witt Tal
mage tells that lii own Newfoundland
dog (the finest in Brooklyn, barks at it!
lthough so natural, no one who sees I
this preminm chromo will have the '
slightest fear of being bitten.
Besides the chromo, every advance
subscriber to THE ALDINE for 1875 is a
constituted a member, and entitled to
all the privileges of
THE ALDINE ART UNION. 1
The Union owns the originals of all i
TlE ALDINE pictures, which, with
other paintings and engravings, are to
be diastribu:ed among the members. To
every series of 5.000 snbseribers, 100 dif- I
ferent pieces, valued at over $2,500 are
distributed as soon as the series is full,

The Saturday Evening Post.
The Oldest and Best Story Paper Pub
lished.
Founded August 4, A. . 1821.
For more than half a beetary the
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARt WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever borne a
widespread and nnblemished reputation
for the unsurpoased purity, reinement <
and excellence of the Serials. Sketches
and Miscellaneous reading matter.
It Is pre-eminently
The Best Family Paper
thht is published in thiscountry, from its
never containing anything that would
offend the feelings of any one, either in
a religious or political sense, ior that -
could not be read at any flreieh withoutI
objection from the most fastidious.
The circulation of the Saturday Even
ing Post, through not quite so large
perhaps, as its younger contemporaries,
is not, like that of some of them, fluctu
sting, and too often short-lived, but
SURE, SOLID AND SUBSTANTJ!AL,
based upon the intrinsic merit of the pa
per itself ad, not dependent on any ex
trancons influences, such as the poplularl
ty of individual writers, &e.
Good, however, as the Saturday Even
ing Post has been in tihe past, it is our
intention to make it still better in the
future, and with this object in view we
will effect a marked improvement in eve
ry department of the paper, and will
call to our assistance writers of admitted
ability and known reputation.
By increasing its former attractions,
and adding many judicious and pleas
ing novelties, by studying how to please
and cultivate the popular taste, by in
creasing Industry and enterprise, and by
enlarged thcilities, we hope to niake new
friends with each and every iaene, and
contiune to maintain the claim of the
Satllurday Eveing Poet to its title of Tli
OLDEST AXND ''U BEST of Family Story
Papers.
