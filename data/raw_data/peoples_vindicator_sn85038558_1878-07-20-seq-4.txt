PRESS GLEAMNGS.
How the Country Paolp ta-!k -
a Constitutional Convention,
[Opelousas Coytier,
offer a reward of tine yei11s sub
tion to our paper for the discove
i,, a man opposed to a constitu
tional convention, that is not direct
ly or indirectly interested in some
office, or that has not a lively expec
tation of some personal advantage
thereby. .
The men of the country that are
not drawing salaries or controlling
government patronage demand a con
stitutional convention.
[Union Record.]
There are twenty-six papers in the
State, says the New Oi leans Democrat,
that are in favor of a constitutional
convention, and in the list givep'by
that paper, it will be seen that the
very best and oldest Democratic pa
pers are engaged on that side of the
question.
Avoyelles Par;Lg.' s.* 4
Resolved, That we regard the as
sembling of a Constitutional Conven
tion at the earliest op p ijlg o
ment as a measure of paras i pli
lie necessity, and one to which the
Democrati, party of this State stands
pledged by every consideriti~n 4't,
ty and public faith to see carried out.
Resolved, That we recomu ud,.to
the State Convention soon fto i
ble at Baton Rouge the proptitof
adopting a resolution favorable ti
immediate calling of such conventiop,
and we hereby declare our conviction
that nothing less will satisfy the peo
ple, nor ought they to be satisfied
with anything less.
Resolved, That the power which
belongs to the Legislature of amend
ing the Constitution, is a vicarious,
exceptional and necessarily restricted
power, to be delicately and sparingly
exercised when not abused, and we
deny the right of the Legislature, urr:
der the form of pretended amend
ments, to substitute what would be
virtually a new Constitution for the
old one, as an usurpation of a vital
and inalienable right of the people
which can only pass without rdbake
when it passes without notice.
Resolved, That believing, a we. ,
that the reforms to which l't l df#
cratic party has committed :tself can
not be effected without aW4 14
change of our organic la* atbdi&on4 i
ing, as we also do, the great I i odf
the people to establish their own con
atitution of government, a right on
which all popular representative gov
ernment rests, we declare our firm
purpose to support no man for repre
tative or Senator whowUill pqtaI p
bimself in advance to :.adtoi e' ,
calling of a Constitutional Conven
tion by the next Legislature as one
among its first acts. ; ,

AGRICULTUIBAL. ,
Early Potakebi " a
The crop of early potatoes this ,ear
finds but a poor market, and, rnetA' with
very slow sale. Prices reeeivwd here
tofore were so good bs to Ov* estimate I
production; staill the crop, jfold as low I
a 15 cents a bushel, will4ore than pay
expenses, if it has been 'well cared for.
Farmer have made so much money from I
this crop inpast years, that they scorn a
t1ir price now. In Eaisrtern New York
and Vermont, where ifour 1i"nieae- '
bor is expended in preparlng'the pgro~d
that is done m Illinois, the potator-grow
