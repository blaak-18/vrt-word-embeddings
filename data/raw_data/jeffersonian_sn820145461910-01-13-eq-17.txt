Its theological department is a

The Story of the New York
“ Watson’s Magazine ”
Dear Friend: —Please inform me
if you can possibly furnish me with
a complete file of “The Jeffersonian”
(Magazine) for 1908 and 1909?
Have been informed that one number
in 1908 file was not to be had. Will
you not kindly advertise for same
for me? With that one exception,
have a copy of about everything you
have ever published. Please do this
for me. Is your “Watson’s Maga
zine” a separate publication apart
from The Jeffersonian? When was
it first published, and may I please
obtain a complete file? Please ob
tain these things for me if you can,
as I am very anxious to complete my
file. Again, I ask you; please do
this for me if you possibly can. An
early reply will be thankfully appre
ciated. Sincerely wishing both you
and yours, a thousand times, from
the bottom of my heart, all the good
that you can possibly wish of good
for yourself and those most dear to
you, throughout the coming New
Year, I am most sincerely .
Your admirer and friend,
OTTO LIPPERT.
Chicago/111., 224 E. Huron St.
Ed. Comment.
Can any of our readers supply Mr.
Lippert’s demand? Our office can
not. We have on hand a few bound
volumes of the 1907 Magazine; and
it is a large repository of an im
mense variety of good stuff, but we
are out of the sets for 1908 and
1909.
The “Watson Magazine” to which
Mr. Lippert refers died a dishonora
ble death, in three months after it
was stolen from me by Colonel W. D.
Mann and Mr. C. Q. De Fraunce.
Through Gordon Nye, I told Colo
nel Mann, that if he’d turn the man
agement of the shebang over to me,
I would continue to edit the thing,
without salary, until the Magazine it
self was able to pay me.
That queer old codger and (as it
transpired) blackmailer, said —“No:
Mr. Watson is no business man.”
So, Nye came down to Georgia to
live with me; and we opened up on
Mann and De Fraunce in away that
laid them out in three months.
Nye had his doubts of our ability
to do it, and he said, “Colonel Mann
is a great fighter.”
I laughed and answered, “Well,
that makes a couple of us.”
To run a Watson Magazine with
out a Watson, was such an obviously
impossible enterprise that there nev
er was. the slightest doubt on my
mind as to the outcome of the skir
mish.
Those two rascals kept on pocket
ing subscription money, to the very
last. It was of course.
When they saw that the jig was up,
they sold the Magazine for $2,000,
and divided the spoil. De Fraunce
went to Kalamazoo to work for the
graphophone people—carrying along
the mailing list of the defunct Maga
zine. I have been told that he made
good money peddling copies of it.
No man ever betrayed another more
perfidiously than this scoundrel be
trayed me. I lifted him from an ob
scure position, where he was getting
sls per week, and made him man
ager of the Magazine at S6O per
week. He was* my sentinel —put
there to safeguard my personal in
terests.
Colonel Mann, “the business man”,
©be Jeffersonian
lost SBO,OOO on the New York “Wat
son’s” —lost it by utterly unbusi
ness-like extravagance, and the in
competence of his men. Although
greatly injured by the failure of a
magazine bearing my name, I have
been able to make a complete suc
cess of two magazines, at an expense
of only $20,000.
There is another publication not a
thousand miles from here, that has
been handled by “business men”,
and which has benevolently assimi
lated about a quarter of a million
dollars.
Without outside backing, and with
no loud blowing of horns, I have
kept pegging away, and both the
Jeffersonians are in a healthier con
dition than the magazine which has
blown in so much money.
The weekly paper and the monthly
Magazine, are now my lifework.
There is no office, and no amount of
money that would tempt me to part
with them. In a sense, they are my
children. If they were creatures of
flesh and blood, I could not love
them more. Through them, my mes
sage goes to my fellowman, and his
answer comes to me. Through them,
I lay my hands on the reins of pub
lic opinion, endeavoring to guide it
right. No man is so rich as to get
anything into the Jeffersonians that
ought not to be there. And no man
is so poor that he can not get a hear
ing and a defender, if some one has
done him a wrong.
It is most gratifying to know that
the influence of the paper and Mag
azine is rapidly widening. Our cir
culation has increased wonderfully,
and we now have a steady and grow
ing revenue from advertising.
By the way, I will give you an ex
ample of how the plutes and grab
bers “fix” papers and magazines:
One of the “power” companies
was solicited for an ad. by our busi
ness manager. The president of the
company offered a contract which
would have paid us handsomely—
but there was a string to it. The
corporation president wanted to pre
sent the power company side of the
question of power-site grabbing.
Our manager passed the matter up
to me, and I said —“Yes, let him
write anything he likes, but I will
reply to it.”
That didn’t suit the corporation
man, at all. What he wanted, as it
finally appeared, was a personal in
terview with me. Was sure he could
so present facts, figures and argu
ments as to change my mind, on that
subject. I told Lanier to write him
that he could come and talk; but
that I was in favor of the public
ownership of those power-sites, and
that the man didn’t live who could
change my mind about it.
We did not get the advertisement.

PROVEN BY TIME.
Don’t fail to read the large Vitae-
Ore announcement and thirty-day
trial offer on the last page of this
issue. Vitae-Ore is proven by time,
by over twenty-five years of success
ful cures. It has succeeded because
of the work it has done. You can
test it without a penny payment and
you ought to do it.
$8,760,000,000!!
That’s the Value of Farm Prod
ucts for 1909 —Isn’t
It Great ?
Think of producing on the farms of the
United States twice as much new wealth in
one year as is represented by all the gold
money in the world outside of this country!
No wonder our esteemed friend, Secretary
James Wilson, of the Department of Agri
culture, is jubilant.
It is a showing that every citizen is proud
of, whether he had a hand in the production
or not.
The most gratifying story told by these
figures is that they represent a gain over the
previous year of $869,000,000.
We are going ahead—going ahead rapidly.
That is the best message we gather from
tliis report of our results for 1909.
But, instead of being content with these
figures, let us take them only as an indica
tion of what our real possibilities are, and
let us use them merely as a mile post in our
climb to better things.
Let each of us, for instance, look back over
our operations of 1909 to determine whether
or not we did our share toward making this
showing possible.
We all know that there are about6.ooo,ooo
farms in this country. Did 6,ooo,oooadvance
improve, produce more wealth —or did one
million, two million, or three million do all
of this pushingand improving of methods to
make a gain of $869,000,000 possible?
We ought to stop and think of what has
made the gains of former years possible.
We must stop to realize that this gain of
$869,000,000 for 1909 is not due to so much
more land under cultivation, but has been
brought about primarily by better methods
of cultivating the same land that has been
cultivated before; by better methods of
preparing the soil, sowing the grain and
harvesting tiie crops.
Without the wonderful strides made in
the development of farm machines, an
$8,760.000.000-crop would be entirely out of
the question.
And yet there is room for progress—the
rules of 1909 farming are not the rules for
1910. New machines mean new advances
and new wealth, Do you keep abreast —are
you posted about these things?
About traction plowing—how to plow
more acres, in less time, with less expense,
for better, bigger returns:
How a good disk harrow will enable you
to make better seed beds;
Why it’s to your advantage to spread ma
nure the right way—as soon as you get it—
instead of spreading it alter half its value
is gone.
About the money-saving and money-mak
ing advantages of having a good, reliable,
dependable gasoline engine on your place;
how it will help to keep the boys at home;
how it will save you a hired man’s wages—
and how it will more than pay for itself in
twelve months:
What the right kind of a cream harvester
means to you in increased mhk and butter
profits—and skim-milk calves:
Why a good feed-grinder means fatter
stock;
How greatly to increase the value of the
1910 hay crop by using the right mower,
tedder, baler, etc.:
How to know all about harvesting ma
chines ;
How to get the most possible profit out
of the stalks as well as out of the ears by
harvesting your corn in the right way—at
the right time:
How to know the ear marks of a good
wagon.
If any of these will help you please secure
a copy of our book “Glimpses of
Thriftland.” That tells the whole story
briefly and in verses that you’ll like. Then
we have some books that are still more
business-like—the I H C Almanac and Ency
clopaedia, and Farm Science. Say which
you are most interested in. All are free for
the asking.
There is an International dealer near you.
He will be glad to see you to hand you one
of our new 1910 calendars, posters, cat
alogues or pamphlets on harvesting and
haying machinesand tools, and tillage im
plements, or any of the machines mentioned
above.
