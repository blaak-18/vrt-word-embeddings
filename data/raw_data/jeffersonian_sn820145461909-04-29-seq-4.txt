Summary of Ebents as They Happen
Instead of having become more re-
assuring, the reports all week
from Turkey have been
steadily growing worse. The
only cheering thing is the ap-

Crisis.
parent victory of the Constitutional
ists, or Young Turks, and the com
plete downfall of the Sultan, whose
fate hangs in a most precarious bal
ance. Whether he will be permitted
to reign as a constitutional monarch
—a mere figurehead—or whether his
real head will adorn some post in the
realm, is impossible to predict. In
the Young Turks party divided coun
sels prevail and the leaders have be
fore them a task that successfully to
accomplish requires measures at once
firm and drastic, reasonable and con
ciliatory. To decapitate Abdul would
certainly be possible, since the city
is now in their hands and Yildiz
Kiosk could not rally around it suffi
cient defense to save him; and to
many who have suffered at the hands
of the despot, the prospect of turning
the tables completely must be rather
an alluring one. Yet the Turk is essen
tially conservative with his own. He
has been bred to loyalty toward his
rulers, however desperately he fought
against his foes. And the idea of
personal violence toward Abdul
Hamid, notwithstanding his crimes, is
one that would perhaps be more re
volting to many of the soldiers and
citizens there than to the outside
world, which takes high delight in
retributive justice—at a distance. So
the question with the Young Turks
probably is simply a choice of two
evils —whether the Sultan, dead or
deposed, would do their cause more
harm in inciting revolt against them
now, than to allow him to retain a
shadow of his authority and glory.
Five thousand killed in and about
Constantinople is the report following
the skirmishes there. The il blood

The most depressing dispatches
come from Turkey in Asia, the out
come of the wave of fanaticism
which started in Adana some two
weeks ago. It is strange to read the
ancient Bible names in such reports
as these:
The Christian villages in the vila
yets of Aleppo and Bivias have been
attacked by Kurds, Circassians and
Nomads, and the inhabitants are im
ploring the porte to send troops for
their protection.
Grave news is received from Er
zerum, the principal town of Turkish
Armenia. The transports of delight
of the people at the proclamation of
constitutional Government are now
being supplanted by a movement in
favor of the Sheri laws, and the
sultan which, it is feared, may lead to
a conflict between Christians and
Moslems.
According to advices received from
Asiatic Turkey, 25,000 Armenians
have been massacred at Adana and in
the vicinity of that city.
The government has sent urgent
commands to the Vali of Adana that
the mobs be put down and the leaders
harshly dealt with. The attacks on
the Armenians appear to have been in-
stigated solely by the reactionaries.
A dispatch received from Mersina
says the Armenian town Hadjin in
the northern part of the Adana
vilayet is beleaguered by Moslem
tribesmen, who are only awaiting
sufficient numerical strenght to rush
the impoverished defenses erected by
the Armenians. The Armenians,
however, are well armed and will put
up a vigorous defense. Up to the
present time two persons have been
killed at Hadjin.
Another message from Tarsus,
said the missionaries at Tarsus, who
were giving shelter to 3,000 refugees,
were well protected. Martial law has
been declared and the situation was
showing improvement. Five hundred
houses had been burned in the Ar
menian quarter where fifty persons
had been killed. Others had been
killed in the surrounding villages.
Aleppo, under today’s date, re
ports the situation of all Americans
there to be dangerous. No mention
is made of any casualties. There is
great insecurity even in Aleppo
owing to the arrival in the city of
bands of ferocious tribesmen. Col
lective consular representations have
been made to the governor-general of
the district urging him to relieve the
situation in the terrorized territory.
The governor-general promised to do
all in his power, but he admitted he
was unable to accomplish much as
there were only 400 soldiers in the
city.
The situation in the country north,
east and west of Alexandretta arising
from the anti-Christian outbreaks, is
most serious. There have been mas
sacre and pillage at Antioch and riot
ing at Birejik. Aleppo is in a state
of panic. There are only four hun
dred soldiers in the city. Business is
at a standstill and there is every rea
son to fear a serious outbreak. The
city is full of Bedouin Arabs, Kurds
and Circassians.
The town of Kirikan, a short dis
tance east of Beiian and southeast of
Alexandretta, has been sacked and
burned.
At Ayas, on the west coast of the
Gulf of Alexandretta, four hundred
and eighteen murderers have been re
leased from prison. They at once
joined the mob and began committing
depredations.
The Turkish government officials at
Mersina have done everything possi
ble 'to check the trouble, but the re
sult of their efforts was limited.
That is pretty bad for a revolution,
but in time of peace the
United States can do
about as well. The sta

have wiped out the population of a

difficulty in keeping the dollar duty
in the bill. To increase it would, I
feel sure, do vastly more harm than
good, for, no matter how some or us
in the East may feel about it, there
is probably more practical politics in
the lumber schedule than in any other

It is not expected that this reduc
tion from two dollars to one dollar
will benefit the consumer, however,
for as is clearly understood, rough
lumber is not used. The result will be
that the saving will go into the pock
ets of the manufacturer, while through
the cleverly drawn “sliding scale”
on the finished product, the consumer
■will pay as much for every plank and
board as he did under the Dingley
rate. Notwithstanding that one op
eration, through improved machinery,
does the work that it required several
processes to do when the high tariff
duties were olriginially imposed, no
common benefit results from the sav
ing in cost of production. The manu
facturer, as usual, gets a double bene
fit, in being able to employ less labor
than formerly, thus materially cheap
ening the cost of his manufactures
to him, while the public is obliged to
pay the same high prices as before.

been reduced but slightly, the whole
