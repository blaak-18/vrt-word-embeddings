"DROUTH BROKER"
Long Dry Spell Followed By
Rain.
The drouth in Shreveport and victnity
was broken last evening and last night.
The drouth baling been broken, who
will mave and preserve "the iragments?"
The lorg dry spell was ended with a
gentle rain-a riodnrate root searcher and
root soaker-which was weicon id.
The raitisli was not sumilent to ill
empty cisterns but the dust was laid and
the temperature rooieu, oonsaderably.
The drouth was broken too late fir corn,
which, except in spot%, is a failure, as a
crop. Cotton in the bills has suffered, but
will be revived and stimulated with more
rain, for which the prospeotb are enoonrf
aging.
Cotton in low laads, streams and bot
toms, has been doing fairly well and will
be greatly benelted by the rain, but the
readers of the Caaossian should bear In
mind that trade will be aleoted in the
proportion of the iees, or the limited yield
of the crop in the bills.
The rain will stimulate the growth of
sweet Potatees and .eld peas, and it will
give opportunity to the gardenerm and the
farmers to tora over snd prepare some
land for early turnips and hardy veg
stables.
There is general rejolelag ever the
broken drouth and there should be rejoln
tag, since the drouth is ended for this
season, at least, although September is
generally a dry meeth.

coolness ast Diet Do Great Thigss
In Keeping Them Well. rA 41
For every adult life destroyed by er
cesslve hot weather there are destroyed
at least ten childish lives.
Babies die like wilted flowers, and igf
norance combines with unusual beat
to sap their feeble strength.
We want to impress on the mothers
and fathers of children a few simple
rules.
Flist comes coolness. Keep your chil
dren cool, dress them lightly and don't
put warm covers on them at night.
Sponge them every day at least once
with a weak solution of alcohol and
water.
If they are on a milk diet, dilhte their
food, giving them the same amount if
they appear to crave it, but adding wa
ter sufficient to make digestion'easier.
Remember that it is important to
give children pure drinking water when
they are thirsty.
The youngest child should be taught
as early as possible to drink plain wa
ter.
The child cries because it is thirsty,
the mother gives it milk to drink and
perhaps destroys its life by overloading
its stomach when the heat makes eves
ordinary digestion difficult.
Moderate diet-dilutedstood.
Light clothing, with the thinnest pos
sible flannel at night.
Frequent drinking of water, pure and
not very cold.
A thorough bath in the morning, with
good, pure soap to keep the pores open.
A sponge off every evening in diluted
alcohol or witch hasel.
No feeding betwees meals, no irreu
lar feeding of any kind.
The above simple rules will keep your
child healthy and may save its life.
Remember that beat affects children
as it does you. Heat sends the blood
rushing to their brains, excites them,
makes them nervous and irritable. They
must lose their tempers, for they are
little and cannot reason. But you
should not lose your temper. Don't
scold, don't whip the child because
Providence has seen At to send the mer
cury up to 100.

tion of death is one of great impor

The professor is said to iave "discov

some interveulaf ebstacle prevents the

He has. repeatedly made a test of this

DISCOVERED BY ACCIDENT.
Kathematlean Learned His Own I
Talent by Means of a Cow.
The retiremtut of Professor Thomas
C. Mendenhall froni the puesidenCty ofu
the Worcester Polytechnic institute
has been a matter of extreme regret to
educators, for he has long been regard
ed as one of the best mathematicians
in the country. He was himself long
ignorant of the possession of this talent
and only discovered it by the merest
accident.
Professor Mendenhall was the son of
a poor farmer in Ohio and was at work
on the farm one day when a resident of
a distant village drove up and struck
a bargain with the elder Mendenhall
for the purchase of a cow.
"Now," said the visitor, "I must get
this cow home, but I can't take time to
drive her 20 miles ahead of my team,
and she can't go fast enough to be led
behind. My lad, I will give you a dol
lar to drive her over to my place."
Thomas jumped at the chance and
the next morning started on his walk
barefoot before daylight. Arrived at
his destination, he received his dollar,
the first money he had ever owned, and
was invited to stay overnight before re
turning. On his way to his room he
passed a book shelf on which lay a Eu
clid. He had never seen a geometry be
fore, and something prompted him to
take this one down and look inside. He
carried the book to his room and pored
over it as long as his candle held out.
Then he dreamed of it for the rest of
the night.
In the morning he timidly asked his
host if his dollar would buy that vol
ume. His joy was so great at learning
that it would that he could scarcely eat
his breakfast, and he trudged home
perfectly happy with his precious vol
ume under his arm.
That was his first step in science, and
his accidental Introduction to Euclid
inspired him to work his way through
school and college and enter upon the
life of research which has placed him
in the front rank of American scholars.
He now has the right to place a long
string of honors and titles after his
name and is a member of half a dozen
scientific associations.-Saturday Even
ing Post.

The oat crop was a failure, and all

THI CROrS AND TKADE I
The Droith the Most Severe in I
Tears.
This season has been one of the 4
most severe experienced in many
years, and the drouth which bas
wrought destruction to the crops is
not confined t) this section alone.
Corn is a failure except in few
localities, and cotton, while suftering,
will recover somewhat, but the yield:
mnst necessarily be limited, notwitt
lug the prognostications of the spec -
ulators.
At any rate there is, unfortunately,
a cirtainty that the farmers will not
have such a crop as last year, when
cern was plentiful and cotton sold
from 9 to 10 cents. List Fall in par
ticular, and last winter were the most
prosperous sinue many years and
men realised more money from their
erops than they had possessed in
years. The colored people from the
country had so much money that
they spent it lavishly and the trade
generally profited from the abund
ance.
Last Fall and Winter were noted
for prosperity, but during this Fall
and Winter there must necessarily
be a limitation ip keeping with the
yield of the crops now growing.
These lines are suggested not in a
eroaking spirit, but rather as an ed.
monition. The merchant and busi
nees man who follow safe and con
servative methods, will not overstock
himself when he knows that the sup
ply at the big centers is always with
In reach, and he can order and recelvc
on short notice whatever he may
need for his trade.
