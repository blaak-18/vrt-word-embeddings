TIIE STOCK LA IV.
As may be seen in another col
amn the City Council of Lafayette
has instructed the mayor to call an
informal election to be held on
Nov. 9, to obtain the sense of the
white voters on the stock lawv.
This action was taken by the Coun
cil at the request of a petition, signed
by a 20zo voters, alleging that a ma
jority of ihet voters are in favor of
amending the law, so that stock be
prohibited from roaming at large in
the night time only. We believe
that the petitioners are mistaken in
this allegation and we are confident
that the law will be maintained as
it now stands. We have failed to
hear of a single reasonable argu
nient against the law, while we
could advance, if necessary, any
numbe: of valid points in its favor.
In this article we will confine our
selves to only a few of them, leav
ing the balance for future issues.
The first and foremost reason
wby the law should stand is-pro
tection to the ladies and children.
With cows, mules and horses graz
ing along the gutters it is dangerous
for them to venture on the street
without a protector. They are of
ten compelled to wade in the muf!
across the street to avoid coming
in contract with some ferocious
looking brute, running the risk of
being hooked by a cow or kicked
by a vicious mule. This alone
should be sufficient to convince the
voters of the unwisdom of the move
to aepeal the law. Who would not
prefer to do without milk and suf
fer the high weeds forever, than be
responsible for the death of a single
woman or ehildP And it is no cx
aiggeration to say that the repeal of
the sto'k law may lead to such a
serious calamity. And again wha\t
right have we to endanger the lives
of the ladies and children? They
too, have rights as well as men and
stock.
Taking a cold, business view of
the question we see nothing against
the law and everything for it.
What would be the use of building
plank-walks to be broken down by
horses and cattle ? The Police Jury
Irhas built a brick-walk around the
court-hause square. It is a rather
poor piece of work, but it is im
measurably better than none, and
should be protected; to allow stock
to roam on the square will be prac
tically turning the brick-walk over
to our brute population, transform
ing the grounds around our temple
of justice into a sort of Pawnee
Bill Wild West Show.
As the law is rigidly enforced in
the arish we are informed that
persons living near town are anx
iously w;siting for the repeal of the
law to drive their stock to the
corporate limits for grazing pur
poses. Our town will then be a
vast pasture for the horses, mules,
cows, sheep of the country peo:le
as well as those of the townspeople.
Tl'he repeal of the stock law would
be a step backward, and Lafayette
can not afford to retrograde. She
is already too slow in the march of
progress.
OPENI7CG TIE IFIGIIT.
N.. O. States.
An anonymous card is printed in
the morning papers which reads as
fvllows :
A mass meeting of the Demo
crutic voters of this city and State
who are opposed to the administra
tion of Governor Foster, and to the
machinery and combination by
which it is proposed to secure his
renomination, will be held at Wash
Lngton Artillery Hall on the 22d
inst., at 7:30 p. m. All Democrats
who are in favor of preserving the
purity and integrity of their party.
who tavor a free election and fair
count, and who are opposcd to ring
rule and combinations, and :he use
of machinery to subvert and defeat
the will of the people, both in the
city and State, are invited to be
present and assist in a movement
for the control of the approaching
Democratic State Convention in the
ifterest of the people. Able speak
ers will address the meeting.
The hope has been very gener
ally expressed that the approaching
campaignr would be conducted with
Out asperity and without vitupera
fetin. We have - ad so much of po
iica! v cfeitcOcllt' in thi, State d:,r
ing thgr- past few years that
conservative men have grown weary
if not thoroughly disgusted with the
incessant turmoil. But this card
indicates that a hot campaign is
projected by the opposition to the
present Governor.
Of course, every good citizen
and true Democrat is opposed to
ring rule and machine methods, and
will vofe against them. But the
question arisies: Does the defeat
of rings, and machines in Louisiana
depend upon the defeat of Govern
or Foster or the election of any
other particular individual ? Ve
think that experience will show that
they do not, and, further, that sup
port of men foe high places solely
on their personalities have always
tended to strengthen such methods
and such institutions.
Louisiana, and New Orleans es
pecially, have long been the victims
of ring rule; and in every election
the ,Reform" cry has been raise4,
but in the end the rings have been
more powerful, and the corrupt
election devices more ingenious and
potent than ever.
In this election we should, in our
opinion, seek for relief in reforms
in our election machinery and the
limitation of the franchise, and if
the Democratic convention shall de
clare for such measures, it is to us
of little consequence who is the can
didate, so long as he is pledged to
carry out the declarations of the
platform.
The States is at this time sup
porting no particular candiaate for
Governor; but it can see no inher
ent objections to Governor Foster.
He has made a wise and just execu
tive; the finances of the State seem
to have been ably administered;
twice he has intervened in the se
rious troubles that threatened this
city with riot and bloodshed, when
the city authorities were unable, or
unwilling, to do their duty, and
brought order out of threatened
chaos'; law and order and general
prosperity have prevailed, and, in
deed, we know of no obstacle at
present in the path of our State to
happiness and prosperity. Why,
then, should we precipitate the
State into a hot and acrimonious
contest over the State offices and
patronage, or over the merits of
prrticular individuals ? Those of
the gentlemen engaged in this anti
Foster movement with whom we are
acquainted are citizens of the high
est respectability and public spirit,
and they have given their time and
their money to the reform of our
municipal government. We do ,aot
believe they are seeking office or
glory ; but the spectre of a combine
between Governor Foster and the
city ring haunt their dreams, and
has inspired their hostility to the
Governor, and if it were true that
the re-election of Governor Foster
nmans the continued domination of
this city by the present corrupt mu
nicipal oligarchy, they would be
entirely right; but the Govcrnktr
has emphatically denied that such
is the case, or that he is in any
combine inimical to the very best
interests of Louisiana and New Or
leans ; and there is evegy reason to
believe that in so far as it lies with
in his power and influence he will
seek to secure to this city a clean,
able and incorruptible government,
that will be an honor to the city
and an honor to the Democratic
party.

LAFAYETTE, LA., Oct. 7. 1895.
To tAe Ho. Mayor and members of thA
City Comtnil of the tomn of Lafayette.
Since the enlargement of the boundaries
of the town I have thought proper to secure
the services of a good person to act as
deputy constable, who under section I1 of
act No. I i hDf 986~. have to appoint, and
for whose acts I, am responsible. - I have
selected, Mr. A. Bourg. Mr. Bourg is a man
of good and sober habits, for whose acts I
feel I can well assume the responsibilities
imposed by the charter. But as my salary
will not justify me to pay for his services,
I would ask that your honorable body pro
vide therefor, as the services 3f a deputy
are now indispensible, I have secured him
at a monthly salary of fifty dollars, with the
understanding that he must give 18 hours
service a day, and that he be mounted when
necessary. Yours respectfully,
I). J. VEAZEY, Constable.
Moved by T. M. Biossat that the appoint
ment of A. Bourg be and is hereby approv

There is one medicine which
_every family should be provided
with. We refer to Chamberlain's
Pain Balm. When it is kept at
hand the severe pain of a burn or
scald may be promptly relieved and
the sore healed in much less time
than when medicine has to be sent
for. A sprain may be promptly
treated before inflammation sets in,
which insures a cure in about one
third the time otherwise required.
Cuts and bruises should receive im
mediate attention, before the parts
become swollen, and when Cham
berlain's Pain Balm is applied it
will heal them without matter being
formed, and without leaving a scar.
A sore throat may be cured in one
night. A piece of flannel dam
pened with this liniment and bound
over the seat of pain, will cure
lame back or pain in the side or
chest in tweniy-four hours. It is
the most valuable, however, for
rheumatism. Persons afflicted with
this disease will be delighted with
the prompt relief from pain which
it affords, and it can be depended
upon to effect a complete cure.
