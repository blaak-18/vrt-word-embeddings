Wanted for Burglary.
In its last issue The Gazette an- t]
nounced the arrest by Marshal Vig- 0
neaux of a suspicious negro named
George Washington White, in whose t!
valise the officer found four watches
and a small clock. White was de- f
tained awaiting identification. On
the 55th Marshal Vigneaux received o
the following telegram frem the ma
yor, of Thomasville, Ala., who had ni
probably read of White's arrest in ei
the New Orleans Picayune which
contained an account of his arrest ui
and detention. Here is the telegram: H
"Hold George W. White for requisition o0
papers. J. N. CAMMACK, Mayor." so
On the next day Marshal l'
Vigneaux, received a telegram from fo
Sheriff Wakite, of Clarke County, al
Ala., stating he was coming with the
requisition papers to- take White to h
the scene of his -crimes White is p
charged with burglary and grand lar a'
ceny of some watches and some tl
money. When informed of the ex- s
pected arrival of the sheriff, White ex- h
pressed his willingness to go to S.
Thomasville without the requisition st
papers. He claims that he will be
able to prove his innocence. a
Should be Stopped. li
This week while at the depot wew
were surprised to see a number of
people carrying in their arms stalks le
of sugar cane, some having as many
as six and seven stalks, and upon
inquiry we were informed that they m
were taken from the cars of cane in to
transit to the refineries. We were told C'
that a certain negro had taken
enough of them to sell to the e
passengers on one of the excursion
trains which passed here Tuesday.
Thirty-five stalks were counted near
the waiting room and, if our inform- m
ation is correct, this is only a re- ti
petition of what has been going on
for a long time. It appears to us of
that therailroad companyought to put Vt
a stop to this reprehensible practice.
The planters ship their came to the t
refineries and they expect to get paid
for them, and it is certainly doing in
them an injustice to allow this thing
to go on. Sc

The young man mentioned in the follow

"Wednesday night at the splendid hostelry to
of Mrs. Charles Gross, a number of invited sti
guests, friends of H-eyman Plonsdy, assem- to
bled to assist in the celebration of his six- Oj
teenth anniversary. Young Plonsk); is a Ri
clerk in the Red Star store of Cougenhem & M
Bendel, and by his close attention to business, on

Is ATTEMPTED ROBBERY.
Wednesday night, at about 1p o'clock,
Sheriff Broussard received a telegram from
B Mayor Dimitry of Carencro, stating that Mr.
SLouis Deleglise, a merchant at that place,
had been robbed of some $15oo or_ $sooo.
The sheriff inmediately went to Carencro,
I began an investigation of the case,and after be
I ing advised of allthe facts, informed Mr. De
leglise that it was his belief that the money
had been stolen by some one familiar with
the surroundings, and that the money was
either hidden in the store or not very far
from it. With his usual activity and skill,
Sheriff Broussard started to work and ex
amined a number of witnesses. On the next
day, when the sheriff was still at work try
ing to unravel the ipysterious disappearance
of the money, he was informed that his
belief of the day before was well founded,
as the money had been found under the ice
box near the desk from which it was stolen.
Evidently the money was placed there by
some one who intended to take it away at a
more convenient time. Mr. Deleglise kept
his money and valuable papers in a tin box
which during the day was placed in the desk.
Much credit is due the town authorities and
c.tizens of Carencro for their prompt and well
directed efforts in trying to find out the per
petrator or perpertators of this robbery.

cil No. zo55 of the American Legion of

"Heywood's Celebrities."
In order to secure this splendid
company for the patrons of his
Opera House, Manager Falk has
guaranteed to the management $x5o
for the two nights, and for this
reason it is hoped that the theatre
goers of Lafayette will show their
appreciation of Mr. Falk's efforts, in
securing a good show by attending
the performances advertised for
Dec. 28 and 29. We give below
the opinions of competent judges
on the character of the troupe:
Rev. Thos. R. Markman of New Orleans
says: "It would be difficult to exaggerate
the excellence of the entertainment given by
the Heywood Celebrities. To this the en
thusiastic appreciation of the audience gave
full testimony. All, from the oldest to the
youngest from the most refined to the rough
seaman from before the mast, uniting with
one voice in expression of the strongest ad
miration."
Times-Democrat of Dec. 12th: "Last
night there was a very delightful musical
entertainment by a company of singers and
players known as the IHeywood Celebrities.
The company had come here with a fine rep
utation, and the character of last night's
performance fully sustained it. * * *
Heywood Celebrities inaugurated the series
of really first-class entertainments which,
some time during the course, will include a
lecture by the Rev. T. )e \Vitt Talmage."
Picayune of Dec. 12th: "The entire per
formance was one of great merit and far
above the ordinary."
Governor Lewelling, in defending
his action in protecting the unem
ployed men in Kansas from arrest
and punishment on the ground that
they were tramps, declared that his
sympathy went out to them because
he was once a tramp himself. He
said that in i865 he tramped the
streets of Chicago without a cent of
money in his pocket, but anxious
and willing to do any kind of work
that would enable him to earn his
living, and he realizes now how he
would have felt had he been arrested
and sent to the rock pile, for no I
other crime than that of being penni
less and out of employment.
