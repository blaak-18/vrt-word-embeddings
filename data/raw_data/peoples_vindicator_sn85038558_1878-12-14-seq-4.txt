WENDELL PHILLIPS,
PH talks to a Reporter about Poli
tics and party matters-The
State of Greenbackism in Mas
saghusetts.
[Cleaveland Herald.]
"Ah, these interviewers are a nu
isances" said Wendell Phillips to a
Herald reporter last evening, as the
latter requested an interview itn the
office of Weddell House. The good
natured old gentleman led the way to
the parlor, took a seat, and at once
put himself into position for a short
talk.
"*'What do you think of the late
elections?" was the reporter's first
question.
"As a Greenbacker, I see nothing
to discourage our ranks. The party
has more than trippled its vote during
the last campaign. I am no judge of
the meaning of elections outside of
New England, but in New England
the victory for the ]Hepublican party
is only apparent. Apparently they
have had a very decided victory, hut
when you come to analyze it you will
find it surface ice, so thin that it won't
bear walking on. If the leading Re
publicans alter the policy of the p'ar
ty from any idea that the late elec
tions justify any change in party lines,
they Rill find themselves much mis
taken. For instance, if Blaine, Cok
ling, or any other man is so mirrch
encouraged by the late result that
they think they can afford to dispense
with
ORANT AS A C(ANIIATE
And earry the country without him,
they will be sadly disappointed, un
less affairs should materially change
within the next t'welve imoths. Thre
South, bidding for the support of the
West by advocating soft money, they
will surely name the next President,
unless their young unadcaps let the
cat out of the bag too soon. My rea
sons for this are as follows: Take
Massachusetts for instance. There
was really no lhepublican victory
there at all. The lines were not dia wu
on any issues that were distinctly
Republican. If Blaine had gone
tieouglh Massachusetts, as lie didt
through Penns3 Ivlania, making bhlood
thirt speeches, lie would have Iet( a
laughed at by Iris audiences and ridi
euled by the press.
THE ONLY ISSUES
That divided Massachusetts were the
money question and the hatred felt
for Butler by the money kings. Many
a man who aided that victory dir it
to beat Butler-not to support the
Republicans. There are men who
would-have drawn their checks cheer
fully for $25,000 to whip Butler, who
wouldn't have given 85,000 for any
mere Republican issue. What be
tween the popularity of Butler and
the strength of the Greenback idea
be, although defeated, got 20,0MrH nmre
votes than elected Governor Rice
last year. When you analyze the
state of: the Republican party in IMas
sachusetts, take for instance tihe Es
ser District, so, overwhelningly Re
pbliean that aiobody doubted Dr.
Loring's election, yet the Greenback
ere nompinated a young lawyer of only
io4$ fame, and he lacked but forty
t$* ''votes of carrying the district
over Loring. That certainly is not a
Republican victory. Massachusetts
ma a body in the State called the
ouncilors, thirteen in number. This
I wnomnposed usually of ren of age
9nd wealth, and men who have for.
merly held distinguished offices. The
Oreenbackers nomiunated a young
plasterer for this otlice, and hie was
elected over his wealthier oplponerit
by ibout thirteen thorisanrd mrajority.
When this state of things is to Ie
found inside tie State the Republican
victory is only pl ipparent. With prop
or organization the Greenback ipalrty,
with Butler at the head ot it, is able
to cortrol the State. I think that
If KEARNEY HAD NOT COME
lato the State Hutler would have been
elected. ThereA never can be more
theia two great parties; the third
Prty is only a tr:mporary expedient,
the Republicau party had miet the
Greenback need and demrand half
wAy, it could, on thle Southern ques
tin and finoance, have built a power
that would have held the country for
the nezt twenty years. The real
ispue is Whether banks shall own and
r1Qe us by regulating thire currency,
or-whether the Nation shall resume
ltctvereginty and control thre cur
rency. England is almost as nntch
agitated by tile question as we are.
All free commercial nations are nec
essarily drawn up to this critical is
adr. It can't be evaded, and tihe
party that assumes its leadership will
inevittably have a very controlling
lioaeece in thire affairs of the nation.
