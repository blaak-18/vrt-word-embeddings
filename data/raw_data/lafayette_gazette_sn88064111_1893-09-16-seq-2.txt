to atspecitl in
aq =ritait striking, riehitecturally
ng buildings IN the tooa .of
afayettq is the Conpent. B.,-des
the main structure, tels ama*averal
outbuildings, including a large class
room devoted to the exclusive use
of a boys school, and, also, a fine
chapel where, religious services are
held every Friday morning. Con
tractor Fred Mouton has just com
pleted the erection of an extension
rendered necessary by want of addi
tional room, which will be used prin
cipally as a class room for girls in
the first and second grades. Here
tofore the commencement exercises
were witnessed by only a limited,
number of people because there was
no available room to accommodate
them, but now this new hall will
give ample room, and hereafter the
class exhibitions will be opened to
the public.
All the buildings have been erect
ed with the single view to compass
the best results. This is noticeable
in the main building where spacious
galleries afford the girls ample play
room during rainy weather. The
class rooms are large and airy, furn
(shed with automatic desks and
other accessories necessary to a
thorough course of instruction.
The buildings are nearly sur
rounded by huge and magnificent
oaks casting a perennial shade over
the neat and attractive playground.
This well kept lawn. forms a fine
recreative spot which is fully ap
preciated by the children, and it is
indeed a pleasure to the passer-by.
during recess hour, to hear the
peals of merry laughter, and so
hearty and happy it rings out, that
it becomes contagious, clearly indi
cating the existence of the most
cordial relations between teachers
and pupils.
For the pleasure of the boarders,
during evening recreation hours,
there is a large play room in which
are several pianos, where the time
can be most profitably and enjoya
bly spent until the retiring hour.
The course of study is broad and
liberal and the constant aim is to
employ the means best adapted to
enable a steady advancement in all
departments. The faculty em
braces eight sisters of the order of
Mt. Carmel, with Mother Patrick as
superioress. The present atten
dance is about 3o boys, and too
girls of which the latter num
ber 32 are boarders, the boarders
being mostly from the adjoining
parishes, and a few from New Or
leans.
A writer in Current -'opics, who
visited the place not long since, ex
presses the subjoined impression:
The convent, a fine educational institu
tion is as picturesque as it is deserving of
note. It covers with its several hbildings
and wide lawns and gardens a large area of
ground.and is presided over by Mother St.
Patrick and the sweet sisters and uuns who
hold such a loving place in the hearts of all
Louisianians.
In a hasty newspaper article it is
possible to mention only a few of
the main features of an institution
of this kind, therefore necessarily
very incomplete. However this we
wish to impress upon the mind of
the reader : This splendid education
al institution is located in a most
healthful locality, and the rates of
tuition and board are decidedly low.
The people of Lafayette are, and
have every reason to be, proud of
this noble institution.
WIfA T IS CLAIMED.
The New York World has been
publishing a poll of the South upon
the question of repealing the pur
chasing clause of the Sherman law.
In Lousiana, the report says,
"about forty towns have been
reached, atnd a very strong free sil
ver sentiment was disclosed, yet
only five towns are reported as be
ing opposed to repeal, while twenty
one are for conditional repeal."
The World's report from New
Orleams is as follows: "The senti
ment in the State of Lousiana as to
repeal of the S~ermaaact is divided.
The feeling was pretty accurately
demonstrated by the vote of the
Louisiana Congressional delegation
when the House took action on the
Wilson bill. Then the representa
tives of the cotton and grain sections
of the State and that territory lying
north of Red river and including
the Florida parishes voted against
the unconditional repeal of the bill
and are in favor of free coinage.
The people of the city of New Or
leans, as nearly as can be ascer
tained, are equally divided."
We are inclined to think the re
port sent out from New Orleans re
presents about the true feeling in
regard to this question.

and- that they will return to their

A PROTECTORATE.
Now we are assured with some
ostentation of authority that the
long dritwn out pother over Hawaii
is finally to be wound up by a spe
cial message from the president
recommending the establishment of
an American protectorate. This
seems to be a rational conclusion
in view of the condition of Hawaii
and the practical importance of the
dominance of American con
trol. It may be the initial step to
ward actual annexation, and to all
intents and purposes Hawaii will
hereafter be a province of the United
States. This decision is a virtual
endorsement of the action of the
American minister in placing Ha
waii under the protection of the
American flag, and the mission of
Minister Blount ends in the ratifi
cation of the procedure of Minister
Stevens, which the administration
disclaimed at the outset.
TAXATION FOR SCHOOL
PURPOSES.
Times-Democrat.
The Lake Charles Echo joins the
other papers that have spoken out
for an amendment to the Constitu
tion which will allow a ward or dis
trict of a parish to levy taxes for
school-- purposes? It says on this
point:
The committee on revision of the
Constitution has a duty to perform,
and it is in order for everyone in
terested in the State's welfare to
offer suggestions, and ours is to
allow the taxpayers. of the several
wards or school districts throughout
the parishes to vote upon them
selves a school tax in proportion to
their needs the money to be ex
pended in the wards where it is
raised. This is fair and works no
hardship on anyone. If ward one
cares nothing for the education of
its children it refuses the tax; and
ward two, more alive to the duties
imposed upon it, can have the pri
vilhge of exercising its right to assist
the meagre sum wrung from the
State treasury by another coutribu
tion from its own pockets. Limit
this right to vote on the question to
the property helders of the ward; as
the man who owns nothing should
not have the right to levy upon his
neighbors' means. This or some
similar plan should be promulgated,
that our public school system may
attain something of tangibility and
be no longer a farce.
The proposition ought to be
adopted, as no possible objection
can be urged to it. We allow the
levy of taxes for levees, the cons
truction of public buildings, roads
and various other purposes, and it
should undoubtedly be granted
for the schools as well. Such a
privilege, as a matter of fact, is
granted to the parishes, and the
proposition is simply to extend it to
the wards, so that the latter can
raise money in addition to that given
by the State should they desire to
do so. If the people of a portion
of a parish want good schools the
fact that those of other portions do
not should not stand in their way.
The taxpayers will be sufficiently
protected by the amendment, and
can and will raise no objection to it,
as it is one wholly in the interest of
education. The Times-Democrat
has already approved the proposi
tion, which is one demanded by the
more progressive parishes *of the
State, and it should be adopted.
It may appear a small affair, but
anything that will help the cause of
education in Louisiana and stir up
an interest in it is a matter of the
greatest importance to the whole
State.
LOUISIANA PLANTERS.
The New York Times, in a re.
ceat article on Louisiana sugar
planting, has the following to say:
There is a big colony of Chicago million
aires who always spend a part of the winter
over on the Teche.
These Chicagoans, to amuse themselves,
thought they would try a little sugar plant
ing. That they have succeeded goes with
out saying. McLaury, one of them, who
owns the Belleview plantation of 7500oo acres,
has made in two years 5,ooo,ooo pounds of
white sugar. He received from the govern
ment in bounty, for two yearsalone,$Soo,ooo,
or more than he paid originally for the
property. Daniel Thompson, another Chi
cago man, who owns a plantation he has
christened Calumet, made last year 4,287,
ooo pounds of sugar. His crop and bounty
yielded him a little over 30o,ooo. So his
amusement has paid.
About fifteen years ago, or may be a
little longer two youeng men from Ohio
came down to Louisiana to look at the
country. They were farmers at home, but
farming in Ohio was not a paying business
then, and it did not promise any better.
heyt went overf the ayes Tiee , and=

years ago 3,048,960 pounds, and last year
4,y5oooo pounds. The crop of last year,
without the bomety, sold for sasoioo. The
htouesty was 9gem maser. The cost of man

IMPOR TANT /UR YSER VICE.
New Orleans Piceayme.
The importance to public order and the
welfare of the whole country'of jury service
by the best classes of citizens cannot be ex
aggerated. It is the jury at last that is the
conservator of the public peace and the ex
ecutor of 'gc laws. Whom the jury acquits
of a criminal" charge is absolutely released
from all responsibility in the case, whether
he he innocent or guilty, and if the juries,
disregarding the facts and the law, shall
persist in setting criminals free, then the
country is in a bad way.
Thus it will be seen that there is scarcely
any public duty so vitally important as that
of the jury service, and it is a good sign
when the people everywhere are waking up
to the fact. .The Grand Jury of Baltimore
has just made a deliverance on the subject,
which is worthy of attention. Itis heregiven:
*It should not be regarded as a burden,
but as a pleasure to all citizens, to be called
upon to assume their portion of the respon
sibilities and to perform the duties incident
to their citizenship. None of these duties
is more important than the duty of jurors
necessary in the various courts of our- city.
To those tribunals come all questions aris
ing from the conflicts of interests and the
violators of all laws- made fur the protection
of our health, life and property and the pro
gress and prosperity of our city. If it is in
the interest of our citizens (and no one will
deny it) that the equity in all questions
arising from the conflicts of interests should
be passed upon by as intelligent and expe
rienced a class of our citizens as possible,
it is much more important to the interests
and good name of our city that the services
of this class of citizens should be had in
meting out justice to the offenders and as
sisting the constituted authorities in sup
pressing vice and maintaining law and order.
With such services, aided by a watchful,
fearless, but just press, if we do not attain
to that righteousness that exalteth a nation,
we at least will be able to keep in subjection
some of the sins that are are a reproach to
any people."
Wants Drainage.
To the Editor of the Lafayette Gazetto:
The undersigned has, some time since,
called the attention of both the Police Jury
and City Council to a certain volume of wa
ter coming from under the Louisiana West
ern Railroad tract that inundates the Scott
road from my place to the coulee on Mr. A.
Greig's place,a distance of about six arpents,
fronm to to t5 inches deep. Said volume of
water, which runs at every bag rain, comes
from the north side of the Louisiana West
ern Railroad, a radius of four miles through
the part of the public road known as the
Opelousas road, of which a piece has been
lately worked, the ditches deepened undler
the tract to the level of said road, bringing
the water into the corporation limits, which
is high prairie land, then its course conti
nues to the Scott road in the corporation
ditches. I have called several times the
attention of both City Council and Police in
vain to remedy the above since two years
and as yet no step has ever been taken to
relieve the above mentioned annoying case
and if left much longer the writer at hand,
very soon it will be impossible to travel said
road (Scott road). I would suggest that a
committee of three be sent to ascertain prop
er means to convey said water through its
natural course and not artificially as is the
case since several years.
