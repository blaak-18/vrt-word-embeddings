RE Rev. Cle
I ment Wright di
vested himself
of his cassock,
left the church
wardens to
- count-the coins
collected in the
offertory and
stepped forth
Into the foggy darkness. His parish
was not, either in point of situation or
in point of emolument, a desirable one,
and it looked more than usually cheer
less on that chill November night; but
Rev. Clement was in pretty good
spirits, because he felt that he had
done his duty. Dreading and disliking
the subject of eternal punishment, he
had more than once shirked preaching
upon it, in defiance of the behests of
his conscience: but this evening, with
all the impassioned eloquence that had
drawn crowded congregations to listen
to him, he had laid down the orthodox
doctrine-the doctrine which "who
soever will be saved" must needs ac
cept
"'That was a fine sermon of yours,"
remarked a tall and very seedy-looking
old man in a battered, greasy hat, who
had apparently been waiting for him to
emerge from the vestry and who now
joined him without ceremony.
"I am glad you liked it," answered
the preacher.
Pt was no new experience to him to
be accosted in the street, and the only
thing about his present interlocutor
which aroused his curiosity was that
the man's intonation was a good deal
more refined than might have been ex
pected from his extremely disreputable
appearance.
"Oh, I didn't like it; no human being
could like a sermon of that kind. Unt
it was scholarly and well put, and.you
spoke as if you awereiit earnet. I was
wondering whether you had really edu
cated yourself to believe in endless tor
ment-that was all."
"We are bound to believe in it. We
are bound to believe in much that we
cannot understand."
"Yes, to be sure-the Trinity in
unity, baptismal regeneration-cterni
ty itself, if you come to that. Still,
there are cases which bring the ab
surdity of this particular dogma home
to a man; my own case, for examplc.
"Once upon a time I had an only son
who went to the devil as straight as he
could go. Personally. I have always
been a bad lot-drunken, unprincipled.
absolutely without belief in any form
of revealed religion, so that I didn't de
serve to have a good son. I am not go
ing into the detalls of the story, but I
may mention that I was fond of the fel
low, that he was ungrateful, and that
he practically ruided me.
"Now, supposing that, after the lapse
of some years, I had met with that son
of mine under circumstances which
placed him at my mercy. I have, or
had, great muscular strength; and sup
posing that I had fallen in with him in
some lonely spot; that he had crawled,
exhausted with fatigue and hunger, to
mny camp fire; supposing that I had said
to him: 'Now you shall be minade to suif
fer a little of what you made me suf
fer;' supposing that I had bound him
hand and foot and thro n him upon
the top of that fire to roast slowly to
death, with nolbody to rescue him from
what hlie had well earned. What then,
Mr. Wrighit?"
"1 cannot believe that any mortal
man would be such a monster!"
"Well, you needn't believe it, because
nothing of the sort ever took place. I
was meuly making use of a parable."
"My dear sir," interrupted the cler
gyman, eagerly, "you are falling into
the common error of applying human
experience to what is superhuman. I
should like to talk this matter over
more fully with you, and if you will
come and eat supper with me-" F
"Do I look like thie kind of a person cl
who could be taken home to supper in t
a respectable house? No, no, Mr. a
WVright; you are welcome to your v
creed, since it makes you happy. I
didn't wait outside the church in order o
to discuss theology with you. I began t
as I did partly because it wasn't Vbad t
way at opening a conversation, and e
partly because my little allegory has ti
afoundation in fact which may interest c
you. I daresay you haven't forgotten
that you once had an uncommonly ras- r
cally uncle, Alfred Warren by name, b
whom your people were compelled to ti
disown." o
"I had supposed that my uncle was n
dead." Mr. 'Wright answered, with a h
somewhat uneasy glance at his ti
questioner. "1 sent him a little money a
once, ir response to an appeal which c
reached me from America; but that t<
was a good many years back, and 1
have heard nothing of him since." iv
"Don't be alarmed; I am not about I
to reveal myself as yomr long lost rel- '
ative. What I wanted to say to you m
was this. I knew Alfred Warren out
in Nebraska, and I assure you that he
had his good points. Perhaps you sc
never heard that he married a widow
in Nebraska shortly after circum
stances had rendered it advisable for tI
him to quit his native shores? WVell. sI
he did; and t e result of his marriage
was an onlon, who grew up to rob
him and ruin him. Now, Mr. Wright,
I will frankly confess that, if I were
poor old Alf, I couldn't bring myself to
forgive that young prodigaL But Ia
take it that your religion commands ai
you to exercise a good deal more
mercy than you ascribe to its founder,
and if you knew that your nephew was sq
ill and almost starving within a
stone's throw of you. I don't see how
yen could reconcile it with your con- tr
victions to pass by on the other side."
"Is this the 'case?" asked Mr. Wright.
"If so, I will go to him at once and do sv
phat I can for him." w
"It is the case. I chanoed upon the di
rPyc asse l a 81thy ciredgla-housesi
where 1 slept last night, and, knowing
his history, I thought I would try to do
him a good turn, little as he deserves
to be befriended by any friend of his
father's."
"What has become of his father? I
never saw my uncle. All I know about
him is that he dissipated his small for
tune and disgraced himself by stealing
by money long ago. Still he is my own
flesh and blood. Where is he now?"
e- "In endless torment, I suppose, it
li. your views are correct. You can't do
If anything for him; but it is just possible
l, that you may be able to save his son,
. at least from temporal torment."
S Rev. Clement five minutes later was
is conducted into the miserable tenement
1e where his reprobate nephew lay toss
id ing in the first stages of typhoid fever.
h WVhile he was satisfying himself that
ih lie had not been the victim of a hoax,
r the man in the battered hat disap
e, peared.
r- It was not until nearly six weeks
it later that Clement WYarren was in a con
Sdition to relate his story to his benevo
d lent relative. Sitting up in the conval
escent ward of a fever hospital, he
e made full confession. It was true
ig enough that lie had been a great black
I guard; he did not attempt to make ex
h cuses for himself; yet he could not help
id pleading that hle had not had half a
n chance. IBoth his parents had been
x given to drinking; his mother had died
o- before his eyes in the agonies of de
lirium tremens; his father, who had
risen suddenly from the extremity of
Sindigence to wealth, had treated him
with a certain cynical indulgence, but
o had never taught him to discriminate
;0 between honesty and fraud, nor ever
v expressed the slightest wish that he
should curbhis naturalpassions. WVhen,
d in order to pay a gambling debt, he
had helped himself to a large sum of
,o money which he knew to be upon the
y premises, hlie was quite unaware of the
.r magnitude of the catastrophe which he
t was thereby bringing about.
LI "iBut the consequence was that fa
_ ther went bankrupt, so lie cursed me
and kicked me out of doors. Then I
went to sea, and for the last two years
g I've had a roughislh time of it. If you
it want inme to say I'm sorry, I'll say so to
Splease you. I am sorry, a'Ii- y'q:-5a.a
Smuch to father, too, if I knew where
to find him."
S "Your father is dead," Mr. Wright
answered, with a sigh. "No doubt lie
ewas to blame; but, then, he was pun
e ished. As for you, you are young, and
life still lies before you. You must
n make your home wvith me until we can
i see our way alittle more clearly. After
a time an opening will doubtless be 4
Sfound for you, since you have had a 1
e good education. No; don't thank mni.
I am a childless widower, and al
Sthough I am.not a rich man my imeans 1
Sare ample for my wants. By the way,
s I wonder who the unknown friend was
who brought me to you. Ie also was
evidently an educated maln, though lie
Sdescribed himself- and, I am afraid,
only too accurately-as a drunken
Lscamp."
Bulint Clement WVarren could throw no
t light upon the stranger's identity.
Only after the lapse of a month, (lur
ing which time his nephew had become I1
domiciled in his household, and had
gladdened his heart by showing signs i
of a sincere desire to reform, did the
eye of Rev. Clement light upon a news

paper paragraph which recorded the v
discovery of a body in the river. That P
the corpse was that of a suicide was e
placed beyond doubt by the following h
written paper found upon it:
"Alfred Warren, having had enough a
of this life, and being short of money t'
to spend on drink, proposes to ascer- a
tain whctlher there is a future for him
elsewhere or not, lie feels pretty sure 64
that there is not, but remains open to

Poor Mr. Wright hurried off to the
riverside tavern where the inquest was
being held, and arrived in time to iden
tify the man in the battered hat. WVhen
orthodox consolations fail one must
needs clutch at the best that come to
hand. "Anyhow, his conduct proved
that he forgave his son before lie died,
and that is something," was all the
comfort that the theologian could lay h
to his soul. I
But the coroner's jury took an even
more optimistic view, and found that Y
the deceased had destroyed himself "

Lo The frames for screens are best made
le of pine or spruce, two inches wide by
. three-quarters of an inch thick. If the
corners are mortised, they will be
L stronger; but if they are nailed against
it each other with long wire nails, when
s. the covering is stretched over them,
r. they will not be likely to pull apart.
it For the Japanese screen in the illus
, tration, make three frames six by twc
Sfeet each, with
a crossba.r
Is through the
i middle of each
. for extra sup
I. port.
1 Cover one side
Sof each with
. burlap, tacking
Sit over the edges
P with small, flat
a headed tacks.
n Now cover the
d other side of each with burlap, this
Stime tacking the top and two edges of
d outside wings with round-headed brass
,f tacks. Give both sides a thorough coat
n ing of thin carpenter's glue.
it For hinges cut eight pieces of thin
,e leather, two inches by two and one
r fourth inches. Fold these three times,
Sas in Fig. 3. This will make each fold
s, three-fourths of aninch wide.
a Now tack or glue folds one and three
,f against either edge of two wings of the
e
I screen, as in Fig. 2. This will leave
a fold two of Fig. 3 as a hinge, and allow
a the wings to swing free of each other.
o But by placing another hinge, re
Sversed, directly under the first, the
e effect wil1 i --t -ke1f tlb tCi..b viose
together, and yet allow them to swing
t perfectly free.
e If the edges of the screen are to be
- covered with'some molding, the flap of
i hinge can be tacked on the outside, as
t In Fig. 1.
a I You can decorate this by using oil
r color thinned with turpentine. For a
e design you can purchase a Japanese
L book for fifteen cents, and enlarge the
drawings that please you.
- Use soft colors, never trying to make
s them "naturalistic." The burlap makes
, a good tone for a background. If the
s screen in treated in one color, as indigo
or burnt sienna,
the effect will
be very pretty.
iSoften your
lines by running I
one thing into
Sanother, so that
thcey will not be
too distinct. Half the pleasure of dec
oration is not to tell all the story, but I
s leave something to the imagination.
The effect is what you want.
Another way to make this screen is
to cover it with coarse cotton and, after
I it is stretched and tacked on, to sponge
it. This will cause it to shrink, and it
will draw very tightly. Then with
flour paste cover it with some fancy
paper.
Or cover only the edge with figured
paper, and paste a piece of gold paper
choosing the
lemon gold
rather than the IFL5 -
pink golds-all iiS
overexcept fora c
margin of one
inch on the sides and five inches at top c
and bottom. 'This gold can then he c
decorated with water colors mixed with r
Chinese white, using the Japanese dc
signs as before.
For the other screen make the frame I
as befofe, but shape the top as shown n
in Fig. 4. Stretch the cotton cloth as
before, and then you can either cover itt v
with figured cloth, tacking it on, or
pasting the figured paper. Let the low-1
er part be darker andi of a slightly tj
heavier design.
Now get a thin molding (Fig. 5). one a
and one-half or two inches wide, anda
tack it on all around except at the top. I
as you see in the cut. i
To make the design at the top, get iý
some modeling material that can be
purchased at any
art store, ands
model the de
sign in imitation d
e', 'ci ,
*f S Si of rococo. It is
s s I i better to draw
* your outline on
board and a
model it there, 0
tacking it on the
frame when it q
has hardened. To finish, paint the mold- e
ing and top ornament with enamel
white. When this is dry, mix some thin
yellow oahre and go over the white, ,
wiping off carelessly with a rag. This ti
will leave the yellow inthe corners, and ,
give a good ivory effect.-Vesper L. pc

ARTISTIC CABINET.
1ow a Woman Managed to Construct One
at slightl Expense.
There are women who can no more
resist the possibilities of a packing box
than they can write immortal verse.
b For the benefit of all such the follow
ing story is told. It concerns an Eng
lish woman whose one passion wvas cup
boards, and whose life work consisted
in the manufacture of these cupboards
.e out of soap boxes, starch boxes, and the
y raw material thrown in her way.
e "Cabinets do not go far toward pro
e viding storage room," remarks this con
d fiding person, "but they are better than
na nothing. It was this reflection that in
,. duced me to -close with the offer of a
singularly tidy and healthy-looking
Spacking case which for a long time
c had persistently tried to draw me into
controversy respecting its fitness for a
higher sphere.
"Tha embsyn "abinet. consisted then
of a box which, when placed upright,
measured twenty-seven inches high by
nineteen inches wide and fourteen deep,
the lid being used as a door. Behind
the box I nailed boards to form a back
forty-five inches wide and fifty-four
inches high in the center, but dropping
to thirty-six inches at each side. This
back I strengthened with battens top
and bottom. The next additions were
a the little upright pieces rising from the
f sides of the box. They do not come
5 forward quite to the edge in front,
a space being left for the small 'quad
rant' pieces which fit into the angles at
I the foot of these. Between the up
- rights a shelf was placed, and the tri
angular shelves were next fixed at each
I side. This finished the skeleton of the
cabinet.
5 "Before adding the spindles, the back
a was faced with Japanese paper, and at
this stage two little shelves were in

troduced into the cupboard, the interior
and the door of which were lined with
maroon cloth. The door was provided
with ornamental brass hinges, and the
front was paneled with lincrusta, the
same material decorating the higher
portion of the back.
"Mly cabinet I ebonized. The rich
color and large surface coveredl by the
Japanse paper seemed to leave me no
alternative if I wished to obtain 're
pose.' After enameling, however, I
wiped over- the raised ornamnent very
lightly with a turpentine cloth, and
this has given a lovely effect of dull
ebony carving on a bright ground.

A cheap-stimnulating liniment which
will be almost odorless and yet effec
tive for outside application can be
made as follows: In one quart of tur- ul
pentine mix one quart of coal oiL Pack
half an ounce of allranet root and two
ounces of pulverized capsicum in a
large, ordinary funnel. Over this mix- he
ture pour the turpentine and oil, al
lowing it all to percolate through the aI
cmpsicum and alkanet root. In this ti
way -it will extract the substance of
the capsicum and take on a beautiful
-ed from the alkanet. After this has
teen done, add one ounce of the oil of 7'
peppermint and four ounces of gum it
camphor. To make it more fragrant
add a little oil of pepper grass. This pE
liniment thus completed is a strong,
efficacious one to rub on the skin, and
so clean and fragrant that even the o
most fastidious would not hesitate to
use it. he

THE TIN DUTY.
.0 Good Illustration of tihe Madness of the
McKitnley BIllL
It may have been altogether acci
Sdental that the report that the duty on
block tin hiad been repealed was ex
tensively circulated for two or three
ndays after the adjournment of con
gress. The confusion which prevails
in the last hours of a dying congress,
the manner in which conference re
ports are written, referring to amend
ments by numbers, tender it impossi
Sble to tell precisely what has been
n done, without a careful comparison of
a reports with the bills to which they
relate,a work for which there is scarce
ln ly time in the prevailing hurry and con
fusion.
5 It is probable, however, in spits of
Sthese drawbacks, for one whose inter
eats prompt him to look after a partic
ea ular bill or amendment, to the neglect
of all others, to keep track of it and to
be able to know its fate as soon as it
is determined. In point of fact, it is
is in this way that the fate of many
1- measures first become known to the
- public. It is obvious, therefore, that a
person thus keeping track of a partic
ie ular measure, which is of great im
)f portance to him and those he repre
sents, but of comparatively little to the
general public, may easily have it in
te his power to mislead others with ref
erence to the matter, if his interests
wivll be forwarded by such a course.
VWhatever may have been the origin
tr of the incorrect information, it hap
pened that the adjournment of con
l- gress was followed by considerable
U speculation in tin. After the report
e that the duty had been removed was
contradicted a rapid advance in prices
Lit of tin occurred. The advance was not
ias confined to New York; at London also
the price rose about three dollars per
ton (12 shillings Od). This increase of
d price was directly contrary to what
was demanded by the statistical posi
o tion of the metal. Rumors were also
in circulation that several hundred
" tons of tin stood in the names of per
sons active in politics, and that these
pr ersons hlad been active in throwing
Sobstacles in the way of a repeal of the

THE SUGAR TAX.
Hlow the Country Is 1liundered Through
the MeKinley tll0. S
ThIe McKinley bill retained a tax on 0
refined sugars of half a cent a pound. t
For the year ending last December
there were imported only 24.000,000 4
pounds of refined sugar, and there t
were exported over 15,000,000 pounds. h
There were imported 3,5O0.000,00 n
pounds of raw sugar free of tax. 'le ii
comparatively small amount of refined C
imported shows how fully the sugar
trustcontrolsour market. The fact that It
we export refined sugars shows that no S
protection, not even that of half a cent ci
a pound, is needed. Asa revenue tax 1I
it amounts to nothing. As a means of ti
plundering the consumers of sugar in V
this country its power will be seen by
a few facts. to
The stock of the sugar trust, still a a
trust notwithstanding its reorganiza- It
tion under the flexible laws of New ti
Jersey, is $75,oo000,000, very largely rr
water. It declared a quarterly dividend a
recently of 3 per cent.. and an extra di
dividend of ten per cent A dividend o!
was paid in January of $1,7.i.0,00, and qi
the official statement is made that it
now has a surplus of $5.000,000. The "
profits of a little less than a year are tl
thus seen to be about 816,00,000. m
These figures are given by the Com- Ii<
mercial bulletin, of New York. ol
The import price of raw sugar is F<
about 3.37 cents a pound; that of re- tli
fined 4.56, a difference of 1.10 cents a of
pound. Deducting 5 cents a pound, di
the tax, and there remains .69 cent a ti
pound, to cover the cost of refining, fi
which is more than ample. Allowing
for loss in refining, and the tax of half Iv.
a cent a pound on the quantity im- Cl
ported nearly equals and accounts for pc
the abnormal profits of the trust. In he
o' her words, the country is taxed some th
$15,000,000 for the benefit of the sugar fti
trust.-St. Paul Globe. nc

tt THE PASSING OF RAUM.
r Fitting Close of a Malodorons Omletl
Career.
Lt The announcement of the acceptance
i- by the secretary of the interior, Boke
o Smith, of the resignation of Pension
d Commissioner Green B. Raum is glad
news.
e Secretary Smith has not waited for

e has summarily relieved the nation of
the disgrace of having Raum occupy an
- official place. For this he isentitledto
,public thanks.
The people do not need to be told
how unfit Raum is. More than once

Sdrag on the administration and a scan

But he is out of office. lie was put
out. The acceptance of his resignation
before a successor is appointed was a
mark of want of confidence. It is an
act that will gratify all good men in
every party. It ends Raum's public

again to the surface of affairs. He is
as dead as Keifer.-N. Y. Vorld.

with the services of the head of one of

obtains in all other departments of the
