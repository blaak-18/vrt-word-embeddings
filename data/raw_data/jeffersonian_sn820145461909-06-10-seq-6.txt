POPULIST PLATFORM EMBRACES
ALL NECESSARY REFORMS.
Dear Sir: —I received my knife al
right and am as proud of it as a wo
man is of her first baby, and am well
pleased with all the books that I
have received as premiums.
I shall continue to work for the
Jeffersonians as long as I am able,
but I can’t do much now, as my crop
needs all my time.
I expect to make some speeches
this summer in behalf of the Peo
ple’s party. I know that the people
are getting tired of this fool Democ
racy, and all they need is education
and calling their attention to the
principles contained in the Demo
cratic platform before the War and
comparing them to those that are
now advocated. If the principles of
Jeffersonian Democracy were incor
porated in the Democratic platform
today as it was before the War there
would be but little need for the
Farmers’ Union, because the party
platform would contain about all the
principles that the Farmers’ Union
are now clamoring for, and if the
Farmers’ Union and all other labor
unions had voted at the polls for
what they wanted or were contend
ing for, they would have been
obliged to vote the Populist ticket,
for it did contain the very principles
for which they are striving, and the
Democratic platform, in the main,
contained the very reverse. It is
strange but true.

A QUESTION FOR UNCLE SAM.
Dear Sir: —What I have to present
to you, I’m sure, is nothing new to
you; but the thought is original with
me, and it seems to me that the
thought which I have under consid
eration, were it in the hands of one
capable of handling it, should cause
an alarm something like a “fuss.”
Here it is: As I understand it those
who fought for the South during the
Civil War don’t get any pension only
what is paid to them by the Confed
erate States. The Union soldiers
who fought in this war receive a pen
sion, paid them by the U. S. Govern
ment. If we belong to the Union,
there is not one who will say that
we are not citizens of the United
States. Why is it that the soldiers
of the North receive a greater
amount of pension money than do
we? And if justice was meted out to
them would not the soldiers in grey
receive a pension equal to that of
the Union soldier, paid by the U. S.
Government? And if we are to pay
them a pension out of our own pock
ets, shouldn’t they have this, plus
what the soldiers of the North re
ceive? Yours sincerely,
MARSHALL LEWIS.

THE PROHIBITION QUESTION.
Editor of the Jeffersonian: —I
quote from the Commoner, May 14,
from the letter of Wm. J. Bryan’s to
“Governor A. W. Gilchrist and Mem
bers of the Senate and House of
Representatives of the State of Flor
ida: I will not discuss the liquor
question because different phases of
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
the subject are presented in different
states, and I am not sufficiently well
acquainted with the situation in
Florida to offer advice.”
Did you ever know a case of dark
er ignorance in regard to the princi
ples of popular government, or a
more abject case of crawling in the
dirt than that?
Has it come to such a pass that “a
great party leader,” a “peerless one,”
even “the greatest American Christ
ian statesman,” as Geo. W. Berge of
this city called Mr. Bryan in a public
speech, years ago, can have no prin
ciples whatever that apply to so im
portant, so vital a question?
Do the “different phases of the
subject” create different principles
of government by which the rights,
privileges and powers of the citizen,
as of the public, shall be determined
in Florida, Maine or Nebraska?
Did the Democratic party, the par
ty of Jefferson and Jackson, fighting
for the rights of the people by abol
ishing everything in the shape of
special privileges; or, later the party
of Davis, Toombs and Lee, ever sanc
tion the right of the people to rule
in regard to what a citizen might or
might not drink, by trying to prevent
him from having the right, or the
privilege, to buy what he wanted?
If it were not for party strife and
churchianity strife, no people could
be found that were mean enough to
keep such a censorship over their fel
low citizens as is necessary to have
any prohibitory law half way en
forced; and no such law can ever be
more than half way enforced. The
exceptions, “for medicine and the
sacrament,” are enough to stamp any
such law as an absurdity; as an idea
born of idiocy.
Respect for law requires that po
litical law shall be kept within its
legitimate province, conducting pub
lic institutions and affairs, and pro
tecting the individual in the enjoy
ment of the legitimate results of his
industry or calling; but not of mak
ing both horse stealing and buying a
glass of beer equally a violation of
law.
No herd of cattle on the plains
ever exhibited less sense when on a
stampede, than prohibitionists do
when urged on by a set of “leaders”
controlled by fanaticism and looking
for “graft.”
Perhaps, some day, Mr. Bryan will
explain under what “phases” prohi
bition and Christian statesmanship
can form a harmonious union or
“fusion.” But then, “Charity for all,
and malice toward none” is always
right, for Robert Ingersoll told the
truth when he said, “Every one is as
he must be.”
“He prayeth best who loveth best,
Both man and bird and beast.
He prayeth well who loveth well
All things, both great and small;
For the dear God that loveth us,
Hath made and loveth all.”

MONOPOLISTIC BUYING.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: —I am a constant reader
of both your publications, and get
Tilje 3effersonidit
more information out of them than
from any other source. Please an
swer just one question through both
your weekly paper and monthly mag
azine; in brief here is the question:
In our town, Jackson, Ga., there is
one cotton firm that buys and con
trols every bale of cotton between
Juliet and Stockbridge, on the South
ern Railroad; they send out orders
every day up and down the railroad
telling these buyers what to pay for
cotton that day. The name of this
firm is Smith & Ethridge. In the
fall in the busy cotton season there
are several cotton buyers in Jack
son, but when the sun goes down all
the cotton bought that day belongs
to Smith & Ethridge. Now this thing
has been going on for several years,
as open as a bootjack. Isn’t all this
in restraint of trade? Has the Geor
gia Legislature the power to pass a
law to put a stop to one firm con
trolling the whole cotton market for
75 miles up and down one railroad?
These are facts that I don’t think
even Smith & Ethridge will deny.
Is there any way to break up the
cotton trust that is now going on in
the South?
Yours to the end of the world,
S. J. SMITH.
Jackson, Ga., May 14, 1909.
Answer.
Unless the firm mentioned prac
tices some scheme which keeps other
buyers out of this field we do not see
how it is to be reached. The farm
ers could ship their cotton to Athens,
Atlanta, or Augusta if local prices
are unsatisfactory.
PERMANENCY OF OUR REPUBLIC
RESTS UPON POPULIST
PRINCIPLES.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson:—Pardon me
for this little inkling. I suppose you
have hundreds of friends writing to
you, expressing their admiration of
such sentiments as are contained in
your Jeffersonians, and perhaps you
think it is silly correspondence. But
we of the “Old Guard,” old Veterans
of ’62 to ’65 (and the 10th of June
marks my 75th mile post, a reform
er from 1890) have nowhere else to
go only in the middle of the road po
litically.
Was in the House of Representa
tives three terms, from ’9O to ’95.
Fought, bled and suffered to defeat
the Tom Jones fraud, but the Bour
bon Democracy was rotten to the
core. lam proud to know that lam
yet ready to stand and defend our
Populist principles, for upon these
depends our Republic. After reading
so much from different journals, the
old question presents itself: “Are
the American people capable of self
government?”
Sometimes I fear we- are not after
seeing or hearing of so much weak
ness in mankind, so easy to drift off
from honesty and catch on to graft
(as it is now called). Oh, how de
plorably weak is human nature!
What a digression from true great
ness, from patriotism, from right,
from good common sense! We can
only hope that some higher power,
by divination, will cause a halt in the
minds of the people, begin an inno
vation of the regime, that one by one
men may begin to think.
With best wishes for you and
yours, I remain,
E. B. LANGLEY.

My Dear Sir: —I am a reader of
the weekly Jeffersonian, a registered
Populist 74 years old, and an old
Confederate. I had the honor of
casting the first vote after the polls
were opened last November at Ster
ling City, and it was a straight Tom
Watson ticket. I was honored be
cause of getting to vote for a South
ern man that has the nerve to advo
cate and defend the rights of the
down-trodden people both North and
South.
I have no education and am no
writer, but feel it my duty to hold
up your hands as best I can while
you fight our battle. Sample copies
of your paper will be put in proper
hands. Some men will not read and
that is our great trouble.
Yours till the last bugle calls,
Sterling City, Ga. W. J. JOLLY.
HOPE TO BE ABLE TO PAY TEX
AS A VISIT SOME TIME.
Dear Sir: —The book “Bethany”
came all right. I read it two or
three times and passed it out to my
neighbors. I was .well pleased with
it.
I get the weekly Jeffersonian reg
ularly, and I believe it has more
good reading than any paper its size
I ever saw. I give it to my neigh
bors to read. They all like it, but
when I mention subscribing for it
they say they have all the papers
they can pay for, but I will keep try
ing and do what I can for you.
Mr. Watson, you have many fol
lowers in Texas, but the people seem
to be unconcerned. If you could
come to Texas and make some
speeches and let the people hear
more of you, I believe it would do
lots of good. I see one man sug
gests that you buy land in Texas. I
would second that motion, for I
think we have a great country and
comparatively new.
Would' love to see you and shake
your hand, for you are doing a great
work. It takes a man of rare cour
age and ability to combat the com
bined forces that are pitted against
you. I glory in the way you dispose
of those brimstone peddlers that are
butting in.
For the dollar enclosed, send the
weekly to J. H. McLeod at Big
Springs, Texas, and the knife to me.
Joe is a brother of mine, a Demo
crat and a great Bailey man, but he
thinks lots of Mr. Watson.
Yours truly,
J. C. McLEOD.

Hon. Thos. E. Watson.
Dear Sir:—l have got a rural
route that brings ffiy mail to my
door. It has just been established
two weeks, and I am delighted with
it. I want to thank you for giving
the farmers this great convenience.
You will always have a warm place
in my heart. O. A. HUGHES.
