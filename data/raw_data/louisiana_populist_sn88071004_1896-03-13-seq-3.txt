It now becomes our painful duty
to tell our many readers that our
city is infected with small pox.
Messrs. Dodd, Denis, Devereune
and others were taken with some
breaking out. Our Doctors niot
being accustomed to treating this
disease, were unable at first to
give a postive opinion. However,
as the cases were auspicious, an
expert was sent for from New Or
leans, be pronounced the cases
genuine small pox.
We trust the authorities will be i,
able to control the disease, and an
epidemic plevented.

NoI orn' can 4ii-pute this ipropo- in:
sition unhl,.,s a party is a mere in
name, without any siniic ne or an
princilhls. It a man is a l)em i
erat Iwcause he calls himself one, o
no matter what he blelieves or ad- fo
vacates, then it is not olbligatorv
on him to support the suffrage
amendient; but if he is a Dlem- '
ocrat beItause he 1lieves in the
lpri.acipls advocated biy the party. an
le iioust support this measure. s
passed by a Demoeratic Legisla- e
ture and approved by the Demo- fo
cratic convention. As a matter of ins
fact, no principle is more thor- aI
oughly in aecord with the doctrines St
and teachings of Democracy than isi
the suffrage amendment, which th
means good governmient, honest n
elections, white supremacy and
Democratic rule. sy
The Boyce Enterprise includes be
an
those who oppose the amendment n
in the Pharr fusion movement, for, o
while some of them still claim the so
name of Democrat, they are, it PC
declares, really in alliance with I
the enemy in opposition to Demo
cratic doctrines. fu
This seems very well understood wi
in the country parishes except in ar
St. Landry and Acadia, where the fa
politicians of ail grades are ma
king a bid for the illiterate white lo
votes by opposing the suffrage v(
amendment. It is only there and at
in New Orleans that the doctrine is Pi
taught that a voter can vote against In
every plank of the Democratic in
platform and yet remain a regular m
Democrat. The convention left
the financial question to the indi
vidual preferences of the voters, ti
to be determined at the congress- c
ional and presidential election, but
it declared its position on the suf- P
frage amendment in clear and un
- equivocal terms, and made that
amendment a part of the Demo- p
- cratic doctrine and belief.-Times- q
Democrat. ci
If any doubt that the Democrat
t ic party is pledged to carry through
I the infamous suffrage amendment i
I by fair means or foul exists, the f
f above ought to remove it. If Fos- n
L ter succeeds in counting himself
in, the machine will never risk the n
Y whole people again, but will count a
Sin and manipulate the suffrage d
s amendment at all hazards. Fos- f,
ter's defeat is its only defeat. e
S'Oh not in cruelty, not in wrath,
The reaper came that day c
e T'was an angel Visited the green earth, t
, And took the blossom away." I
On March the 7th, the Reaper p
garnered in his sheaves a precious a
° bud of maidenhood, Lu. MAY, f
Seldest daughter of John W. and e
SElizabeth Bbers. a
S Her illness was so brief that 6
the icy handl was upon her, before
Sthe loving ones around the bed
Sside, realizhed that Lula was in a
e serious condition.
e Scarce one short week ago she S
was at her accustomed desk in our I
Sschool, wminning the admiration a
and love of the teacher by her 1
ever ready obedience; and by her a
t diligence, and great ambition to
strive onward in our most advanc
ed class.
Sadly we miss the pleasant corn- i
panmon and willing helper, and i
are loth to enter the school-room a
where so great a void is felt. Oh I
E that vacant desk ! with dimmed
eyes we look upon it. Reverently I
rwe gather away the books whichi
rare bedewed with our tears. On
t playground, no longer is her
ga laughter to be heard, but her t
voace still echoes in our hearts.
s Though Lula is dead, yet sea
shall live forever in the memory
ot all who knew her, as she was a
loving and devoted daughter, a
a kind and sympathetic sister; truly
the very sunshine of her home.
It is meet that one so pure sshould
leave the earth in her sixteenth
year, ere sin's polluting breath
would reach her, and like the
sprn flowers, rise from a darker
aabode to one of golden light above.
ge May the Christian faith sustain
n- the bereaved parenmt and relatives
' In their hour of affliction, and lead
r. them to say "Thy will be done,"
ad whilst believing that
at "All is light and peace with Lula."

industries equal protectI ,n to that
afforded the industries of other
States. An American, not a Brit
ish system of conmmercial laws,
that no discrimination against our
agricultural and industrial classes =

4. We favor a just and liberal
system of public schools for the
benefit of all classes of our people,

many years the management of
our public school system has been I
so defective that the party now in
power seeks to disfranchise a large
number of our citizens on the
grounds of ignorance.
5. We denounce the disgrace
ful and infamous election frauds
I which have prevailed in Louisiana,
and we demand and are determin- T'
ed to have a perfectly honest and
fair election, at which each citizen
qualified to vote, shall cast his hal
lot freely and secretly, and the
e vote shall be fairly counted as they
are actually cast. This is the su
preme issue in this campaign, and
in its success the honor, manhood

t ballot box stuffer to the fUont, and
placed him in power in Louisiana,
must, in the name of liberty, jus
tice, morality and common decen
- cy, be suppressed.
t 6. We oppose and denounce the >
proposed suffrageamendment, con
cocted by political schemers, not to
purify and elevate the ballot box
t but to subserve their selfish pur
-poses by providing contradictory
t_ qualifications, to suddenly disfran
chise large masses of worthy citi
zens, by deluding the people with
promises of changes m the next

it whole amendment as a vicious
C, fraud which proposes measures and
methods that are un-American and
destructive of free institutions.
7. We favor the utmost econo
1e my of expenditures, in State, city

interest in Louisiana, whose wel
fare is bioader and more sacred
than party lines or partisan poli

,. true men and honest citizens of
Louisiana, without regard to past
