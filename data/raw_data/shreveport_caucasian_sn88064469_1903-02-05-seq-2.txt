LAST OF THE HUGUENOTS.
Few Traces of the Community In
the East End of London.
When Princess Charlotte entered
London for her marriage with King
George and the coronation revels which
followed It, she passed from White
chapel to Islington through a prosper
ous French section known as Spital
fields. It was the settlement of the
Huguenot refugees, who carried their
Industries as well as their religion from
France and planted mulberry trees In
large gardens where silkworms could
be fed on home grown leaves.
The descendants of these weavers
were rich and prosperous in the days
of George III., and they lived in fine
old houses, with oak paneled rooms
and high latticed windows close under
the eaves, where they could have light
for working their looms. There were
as many ad a dozen Huguenot churches
In the east end of London during the
Georgian reigns, and when the beauti
ful Spitalfields church was built, with
I Its lofty spire, its bell early after sun
rise and again at curfew was the sig
nal for thousands of industrious weav
ers to begin or end their labors for the
day. The industry has disappeared,
the houses have fallen Into decay and
the gardens are neglected. Spitalfields
has lost its French aspect and been
converted into a swarming ghetto.
In order to find a distinct trace of the
Huguenot community, which Lad so
honorable a history in the east end, one
must now go farther out in Hackney
and visit the French Protestant hos
pital near Victoria park. It is a beau
tiful modern structure designed In imi
tation of an old time French chateau,
and It stands in spacious, well kept
grounds which offer a marked contrast
to the ordinary east end environment.
The institution owes its origin to a be
quest made by a French- Huguenot
refugee two centuries ago and to- lib
eral contributions from weavers and
merchants in London. Work was be
gun near Peerless Pool, In the northern
suburbs, where a hospital for poor
trech Protestants and their descend
sits was opened and wos long known
afectionately aamong the refugees as

A MEAT ITEM.
Ham Very Useful In Cold Weather.
"Pan Broils" and Other Wrinkles.
Through the cold weather the house
hold financier will find her meat bil
considerably lower If she keeps part of
a ham oti hand.
For a small family the larger end of
a medium sized ham is better than an
entire ham. At the time of purchasing
have the butcher cut several slices
from. your purchase. These may be
rubbed with lard or suet fat and will
keep in prime condition for a week at
least. The grease Is easily wiped off
when frying time comes.
Ham may be broiled, but for most
families It is best to "pan broil" it, for
in this way the fat is kept for frying
purposes. Pan cooked ham should be
cooked slowly, drawing the pan back
from the fire after the first few mo
ments. Always freshen the first slice
cooked, and then use judgment. Some
ham Is fresh enough for immediate
use. It is unnecessary when having
boiled ham and vegetables for dinner
or baked ham for the principal meat
dish to boil the entire amount of ham.
Especially is this undesirable In small
families, where one soon tiles of a dish
often repeated. Cut off four or five
pounds of the ham in a compact chunk
and boil or bake It, leaving the rest to
be used later on in the same or a differ
ent way. One should remember that
the ham will keep if the sliced side is
rubbed with lard or cornmeal almost
indefinitely during the cold weather.
Do not use It so frequently that the
members of your family tire of the
name ham. Remember it is only to sup
plement and eke out the purchase of
other meat, more especially for break
fasts and luncheons.
If the ham has not been skinned,
pour boiling water over it and when it
Is cool enough to handle scrape and
wash clean. If the ham is a large
whole one, It will require a wash boiler
In which to boll. For the small piece of
ham mentioned above use an agate ket
tle. When the cold water with which it
was covered comes to the boiling point,
draw the kettle to the back of the
stove, where it will cook gently until
soft enough to pierce with a fork.
Change the water twice while it is
cooking, ladding boiing water each
time. A cupful of vinegar added to the
last water improves the flavor wonder.

) [Special Correspondence.]
a Kansas City, Mo., Jan. 27.-The
Missouri river has performed many
strange and erratic feats, but the
ý recent abandonment of Nebraska City,
Neb., in a single night must be
regarded as its star performance.
t Between suld :va and sunrise this
most remarkable of rivers left its
bed in front of Nebraska City and
t found another for itself two miles
r distant. When the good people of the
town arose in the morning, they were
e appalled to find that the river that had
k been running past their doors for a
score of years had suddenly taken its
e departure, leaving only the bed of dark
t gray sand and silt where twelve hours
e before had coursed the turgid waters of
the "Big Muddy."

Missouri, which is a stream of innu
" herable bends and turns. Twenty-five
years ago the river was comparatively
straight in front of the site of Nebras
ka City, but it suddenly swerved in
against the Nebraska bank and estab
lished there a channel fully two miles
from the, bed in whise it had been
wont to flow. It looked like a perma-u
neat change. The founders of Ne
braska City were without doubt of its
permanency. The city was built, and
the river was made the source or water
supply'.
Of course all this it bad for Nebraska
City, involving some serious losses and
mwch nlconvenience and giving rise to
perplexing questions affecting riparian
I;rights and real estate titles. However,
to an enterprising and progersive town
like Nebraska City the damage iso not
irreparable. The troublesome thing is

WITH THE AUTHORS.
Humorist Dungs' New Editorial Job.
How Elinor Glyn Writes.
[Special Correspondence.]
New York. Jan. 20.-The Harpers re
cently purchased the Metropolitan
Magazine, a periodical whose chief
specialty was the printing of half tone
pictures of chorus girls in tights. It
is announced that Colonel George liar
vey, who is the directing spirit of the
reorganized Franklin square house,
does not intend to continue the present
character of the publication. He
means to mn:tke it a magazine for New
Yorkers, and he has installed as editor
John Kendrick Bangs.
It will be interesting to learn which
of Mr. Bangs' literary activities will
be the mort drawn upon in editing the
publication-his term as editor of Hor
per's Weekly or his more prolonged
and doubtless con amore chronicles of
the world of idiocy. There are not a
few, however, who think Mr. Bangs
can he trusted with the leading strings
-or is it the whip?-of a serious and
wide awake magazine, into which no
doubt the Metropolitan will evolve.
Elinor Glyn, whose new book, "The
Reflections of Ambrosine." has stirred
up a tempest in a teapot, has been
questioned regarding her literary meth
ods. She said she hadn't any. "I have
never met any literary people." added
the young lady, "and do not belong to
any 'societies,' so I have not a notion of
the manner in which real authors write
books.' I only wrote 'The. Visits of
Elizabeth' to amuse myself, without
any idea of publishing it. I was ill
with rheumatism and felt sad, not be
ing able to walk, so wrote to divert
myself, taking my ideas from old Jour
nals of mine that my mother had kept,
which I used to write for her when vis
iting about when I was a girl."
While returning to his home in Grand
Rapids, Mich., recently Stewart Ed
ward White, the author, fell into con
versation with an elderly man in the
smokinig room of the parlor car. The
man, as he afterward found out, is one
of the most prominent lawyers in Ohio.
The talk turned upon the timber inter
ests of the north, -and several other
men took part. Mr. White has lived
half his life in lumber camps and
showed a familiarity with the subject
that greatly Interested the Ohio law
yer, who presently turned to him and
said:
"Young man, do you know of a book
called 'The Blazed Trail? "
"Yes; I know of it," said White. "In
fact"
"If , you haven't read that story,"
broke In the man, "you ought to get
out at the next station and get it. I've

The early life of Charles Wagner,

mountains. His natural inclinations
kept him out of doors the greater part
of the time, and so the worship of na

proselytes.
It is told of him that once when to
