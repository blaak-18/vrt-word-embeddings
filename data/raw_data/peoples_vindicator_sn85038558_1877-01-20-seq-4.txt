D)avid Dickson says that,"''when
cotton is below 16 cents, the ten
ant and landlord, in four cases
out of five, lose money," and
produces his own examples with
an average of three bales to the
hand, which is a good one, to
prove his staterient," astonishintg
as it seems,
In view of these facts no one
will say that the great staple has
been remunerative, on the contra
trary, it has been ,produccd aind
sold at a positive loss.
This is in Georgia, mind yon;
but will not firmers now try the
estimate, and let us see what it
costs us to produce a pound of
lint cotton.
We invite letters from our
fartner friends, from this and ad
joining parishes, and will take
pleasure in pubilishinig actual sta
tistics with regard to this imnpor

In Doluwnaro Counlty, Ponn.,
a farmer's ldaughtcr commenced in
the Spring of 1873, with ti) com
mon hens and two Cochin cocks,
and firom themi raised 350 chick
ens. D)uring the season she sold
eggs to the value of 8$90, and from
September 20th to January 17th,
she fattened and sold 150 pairs of
fowls for $260, making the total
sales $8530. About two hlours
daily were occupiedc in caring for
the hens. Will not some of our
Natchitochesu, Sabine, Red River~,
Winn or Vernon farmers' wives
Sshow us that they can do as well.
Let somelody contribiute to the
VINDiCATOR her experience with
fowls.
A Sad Picture.
How well this picture shows our
situation, and it is from a way off
Southern State, at that.
"We have excellent pasture,
both Summer and Winiter for
stock, but it does us very little
good. When thie war ended, we
had on the place 400 hogs, and
onily one dog. In a year after the
war we had four hogs and twenty
three dogs. We had also 175
head of good cattle--now we have
10, We had good fruit and plen
ty of it, but now barely get enough
for our own use,
Ift we push the negro off' our
place, our neighbor will be glad to
take him, and then hIe will raid on
us more tihan if we lhad him at
home. If we succeed in getting
one up for misdemeanor or theft,
some- sympatising neighbor, or
liberty(f)loving lawyer who has
either cotton to chop or pick, or
wants a fee, is delihated to go on
or get bond to keepl him from con
viction or pilferiung. Since 1867,
this )plantation has paid thirty
thousand dollars fior meat and bread
all of whic ought to have been
produced at home, but it was im
possiblq."
There are hnndreds right among
us of farmers that the above ap
plies to with truth. lBut this can,
and must be cured, How ? is the
question. We answer, by simply
abandoiing the old way of ma
king mneat and bread a serious
part of fiarm work, and first begin
that by stopping the exclusive
cottoa cultivation, which cannot
nor never will pay, and by so do
ing, give more tine, more atten
tion to tirnm work. If pasturing

CA PROT1S.
'The people of the Smith neglect
the c,'rrot ,as a crop, and yet is one
anrong "h'st crops that c1d1 be
grown. It succeeds well in our cli
rmate and Ilourishes in any soil that
will bringII good turnips. A popular
iwriter siays it is the most vabl'thle
eseluilent in the entire range of I:rac
tical hulblandry on account of its su.
p1(rior properties as a general article
of foodl for several descriptions of
animals usually kept ou a treIn.
Where onrce introduced it will evcr
remain piopular as a valuable article
of food for horses, pigs and poultry
of all description. Butter ot the
lrost agreeable appearance and ex
quisite flavor may be obtained for the
table ,by feeding milchi co)Ws on car
rots, and if stored for them during
winter there will be no dimlinution in
quantity or deterioration in the qruali
ty of their produce.
In establishments for trotting or
racing horses, carrots are especially
benreficial. Toward spring, when the
horses have been fed for many months
on dry fiood-o-jts, corn anrid hay-
they are extremely serviceable, irn
deed necessary. Amlong hlorsemneni
they have gained the character of
l;( ig good for the wind; but we sus
peet the only merit they can claim in
this respect is that they keep the
bIodly cool and open, by which they
condlec greatly to health antd condi
tion, and consequently to clearness of
wind. Albouit the sarme thing mray be
,;a oft their claims to producing a
ilie CUoRl , iUluhLt,V i ,t u %.o i t
health does so; consequently carrots
do. To anly one who has been in a
racing stable, or any stable where
carrots are fed, it moy serrem almiost
useless to say that they slihould be
sliced in very long slices. It is dan
getolls to give them cut crossways,
as horses are extremely fond t(f them,
and, if at all greedy, would be apt to
bolt pieces of them whole, whichr
would be quite likely to cause somine
of themu to stick in thie throat. Car
rots, if kept in a dry place, in sand,
will keep a long timne; or, in sanid,
they wiill keep out of doors, if cov
ered sufficiently uvith straw and then
ibanked up with earth.-Mobile Reg

FIELD NO(TES.
Of all persous thie farmer should
study hIris profession. By stndy I do
not rmean simply suchl things as are
learnedi in books; but lie shoutld stludy
at the plow-handle and in the field,
among hris flocks, in his orclrard, and
particularly in his barn-yard.
In one sense thie farmer is also a
manufrractrer. He changes hris grass
1and corn into beef, pork, wool, but
ter, cheese and a nariety of products.
In anrotler sernse ie is a cremnlist; lie
so) corriounds nanlrare with his soil as
to rmake both available plant foond.
lie should be an artist of artists, so
as to be able to produce tihe beautiful
groves, orchiards and lawns, for the
iiteirior artists to paint, sketch and
engrave. And above all, hIe should
be a brain worker. Aid yet how
iany tlrCere are who thiirk any sini
lieton can bae i farmner! What is tIhe
trourlle witlh nine-teiiths of the far-nis
in tIlne lInd I I will venitue an aln
swel : Want of brain plower n'po
perly imanaged.
Ask thIe average westecl'n farmer
lwhat is his systeml ofrotation of' elnips,
arl, if lie e hionest, lie will tell you
ie has nInie. You need inot ask what
:re Iris p!ius for iallking and saving
rrrnnllinre--a glanrce at hIis tfiumin will
shliw you tiiut lie has none. Such a
marrni may bie successful in raising ar
few C-rrlps of corn anid wlleat on new
rlindl, buit what will ie do when Iris
lindrl will not produce P3ayilg cr'ops ?
Probably hie will take hreeley's ad
vice, sell oat anrd "lgo west." As a
pranlctical, lifeo-fong farmer, this year
completing my fi-st hIalf century, and(
twenty-seven .yearrs' experience of
farrming in thIe west, I ami more than
ever inripressed that it is a life long
work to make a good flarmin. A farml
er ineed not always work like a slave
-in fact, never like a slave, but like
a free man. He should hrave an edru
cated, active brain; hie shliouht have
books and agricultural papers as a
part'of hisi stock in trade, as well as
hiis fine stock and imnproved farming
iriplenients, and, alove all, he sihoull
remnember tliat riches may "take to
theinselves wings and fly away," but
thie accumulations of brain and heart
are imperishable.
Says a cattle-raiser :-"Salt should
be furnished to all animals regularly.
A cow, an ox, or a horse needs two to
four ounces daily. Salt increases tire
butter in mnilk, helps thie digestive
and nutritive processes and gives a
goeod appetite. Thie people of interi
or Europe have a saying that apound
of salt makes ten pounds of flesh.
Of course salt only assists in arssiolu
lating the food, it does not make flesh,
nor bonerC, nor musclcle
