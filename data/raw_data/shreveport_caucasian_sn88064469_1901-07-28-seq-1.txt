A REWARD OFFERED.

The International Council of the World

ceatiun, with headquarters at Seattle, State
of W aebington. whi ch fters '"a reward of
:oo.u for the apprereonson and convic
non of each and every person whatsoever

* * of good mental and poisical health,

of the association. The apparent purpose
of this concern hiving been mode plaio,
the query is, waat inteleat can they have
in 1" 1) MoLand, a negro, lynched ii
Boasstr with Prophet Smthb, who, if not
directly, were indirectly responiable for
the assasesnation of John Gray Foster.
A, a way have the council Ignored
Smith, the Prophet, the negro wh> barely
escaped lynchIng in Texas, woo, with
McLaed, was hanged in Bossiei ?
It is assumed that r D Mct.and was
insured and the Prophet was not, and if
MoLand Was, then the company must pay
over to his beneiclary the amount of hia
policy. Toe ooncern could not consist.
eatty avoid or evade payment because
MeLand was lyocned, but the anlmas of
the concern is plain. While the men at
its heau know full well teast no reward, be
it everaso tempting, would lead to the ap*
preheasion and conviction of say one con
nected with the lynchnt, their purpose is
to ltensify racial prejudice and to secure
notoriety which may be stimulated to their
Ananc'ai advaat.ge. The aeion of the
concern may Oe approved in Seattle and
other portions of tae North where the
negro is regarded as goon as a white man,
and, is some lnstances may be better (has
some white men in Seattle and eleiwhure
In tas great aisaes of the West as well as
the Slates of toe North, isoluding the New
Magland States, but such manileatatlon
can only arouse a resentment whion must
operate against all the colored people and
all socetees and _orgaalzatUns of colored
people.
Too lynching of MeLand, together with
Prophet Smith, was dictated by a sense of
ianecurity, resulting from a diabolical
crtme-the murder of a most timnable
Jonig man, whose death had beon ordsaind
by a number of eoasplratoro-aegroes
banded and controlled under a reUigous
frensy, of which Prophet Smith was the
recognised head and McLand was his
ready and willing tool. I Ia true that
Priaee Biwards is the negro who fired
deliberatelyshe gun with whioa Mr oseter
was murdered, but Prophet Smith san
MoLhand were near by, antuoipatiag what
happened and made no effort to stay the
hands of Edwards or to ;warn Mr tnster
of his doom.
.1 he conspiracy was lear and the fnger
of guilt pointed directly and unerriagiy at
Propuet Smith and McLand. Perhaps the
law should have been permitted to take lea
coure, but the otizsns of Booster bad
ieceme it rased over the murder and hau
uoesmaaned on a speedy exampie which

General Hughes cahlls the news of
the first surrender of insurgents it the
island of Samar, 500 men with 2 field
guns, 30 rifles and 70 bolos, giving them
selves up to the authsrities.
The opinion prevails among United
States officers that it will take years to
accomplish the economic progranmne of
General Corbin. The civil and educa
tional authorities hold that the contin
uance of protection over minor posts is
necessary, aside from that afforded by
the constabulary. It is generally ex
pected that concentration will be more
gradual than anticipated in Washing
ton.

the ceremony on the gaound that their
pay is in arrears. These men have ad
dressed letters to King E award, point
ing out that they cannot submit to be
decorated while their wives and fam
ilies and some of their number are starv
ing. Claims of men who say they have
not been paid vary from £83 to £127.
Some of the claimants say they have
had to pawn their earlier medal in or- -
der to procure food for their families.
