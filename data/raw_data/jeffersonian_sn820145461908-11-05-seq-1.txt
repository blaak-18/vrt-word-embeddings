Summary of Ebents as They Happen
By Tom Dolan
The Jeffersonian is a little late this
week, but similar tardiness will prob
ably not occur again in four years,
so our readers will pardon us. We
are human—and we wanted to see
how the thing came out, before going
to press. It is as yet too early to
know all about it, but Wm. Howard
Taft will be the next President. Mr.
Bryan probably did not receive as
many votes as did Mr. Parker. The
next Senate will have about a two
thirds Republican majority.
* * *
As nearly as can be told, Taft has
carried the following states, many of
which were classed as “doubtful”:
California, Connecticut, Idaho, Illi
nois, Indiana (Kern’s stronghold)
lowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachu
setts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New
York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South
Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington,
Wisconsin, Wyoming. West Virgin
ia and Maryland are still doubtful,
while the others went for Bryan.
* * *
•
Gov. Hughes, of New York, was re
elected. Gov. Folk, of Missouri, was
defeated by Senator Stone, for the
Senate. The cont-est was close in In
diana and West Virginia, with slight
Republican gains, while in Ohio a
Democratic governor is probable.
* * *
In Georgia, the vote by counties
shows Air. Bryan’s popular vote to
have been cut down to small propor
tions. All the precincts over the
state have not been heard from, but
it is certain that the Tenth district
went pretty solidly for Mr. Watson,
while a heavy vote has been polled
in many other counties. Mr. Taft
received a large vote in several
counties. The vote polled by the
other parties—lndependents, Prohi
bitionists, etc., was negligible. It
was altogether a remarkable situa
tion, and the strength shown by the
Populists in many places where hith
erto Populism has been an unknown
quantity, more than anything else
affords encouragement to those who
fought so goad a fight.
* * *
The heavy rain and vile roads in
Georgia yesterday kept hundreds of
country people from getting to the
polls at all, which gave the cities and
towns a considerable advantage.
Much gratitude is due the unselfish
men of our party who braved the ad
verse conditions and were on hand
from early in the morning until night
fall, striving for the success of prin
ciple.
A Weekly Paper Edited by THOS. E. WATSON and J. D. WATSON
Nationally and Locally—two facts
are apparent. The Bryanite party
is not only defeated, but put to utter
rout, while Jeffersonian Democracy,
as represented by Populism, is the
livest issue before the masses today
and will sweep the country like a
flame before the next presidential
election.
J. S. Coxey, of Alt. Vernon, Ohio,
who has been speaking throughout
Georgia during the past week, has
won many friends to himself and the
cause. His explanation of the cur-

rency question is wonderfully clear,
and his abiding faith in the princi
ples of Populism is an inspiration.
He has had fine meetings, the rallies
at Villa Rica and at Columbus being
notably successful.
Charles F? Barrett, President of
the Farmers’ Union, lias issued a call
for a great convention of cotton
growers, including not only union
men, but those who do not belong to
any organization, to meet in New
Orleans on November 11.
On November 1, 1858, Queen Vic
toria was proclaimed Empress of In
dia and in commemoration of that
event King Edward has just issued
a lengthy message to the people of
that country, which meanders through
the usual platitudes as to the peace
and progress of India under Eng
land’s beneficent administration, com
mends the “loyalty” of the Hindoo
soldiers and subjects in general and
holds out the promise of gradual rep
resentation by Indians in the govern
ment of their own nation. What es-
Atlanta, Ga., Thursday, November 5, 1908
feet this ponderous document will
have on India is highly problematical.
Great Britain’s hold on India grows
slighter every year and the aforesaid
“loyalty” is the merest necessary
sham.
At a recent peace conference in
North Carolina, Congressman Hobson
took the position that the army is
possibly large enough but that a
larger navy is needed to keep down
militarism and unjust demands by
foreign powers. How he arrived at
■ this luminous conclusion only Hobson
could tell.
The creation of immense navies in
nowise diminishes the demand for
tremendous armies. Instead of the
one taking the place of the other, the
two evils grow together like Siamese
twins and woe is to that country
which gives way to the Jingo spirit.
Taxation, industrial slavery and
insolent military oppression are in
store for posterity if America does
not wake up to a realization of the
rocks upon which she is drifting.
President Castro of Venzuela is
reported as a very sick man. There
is not much wonder that the tremend
ous strain of governing his country
under the exciting conditions which
have existed for the past many months
should have broken him down. It is
not unfair to believe that Castro is
as brave as he is picturesque. The
world wonders what will be his
answer to Holland’s second note
which is believed to have set the
date for the annulment of Castro’s
transhipment decree which has been
objected to by the people of Curacao,
at November 1.
The Canada elections have just
taken place, resulting in the re-elec
tion of Premier Laurier for the en
suing five years.
It is announced that Dr. A. M.
Soule, President of the State College
of Agriculture at Athens, will re
sume at once the farmers’ institutes,
as held last summer, the dates being
as follows:
Cedartown, November 5; Buena
Vista, November 5; Lawrenceville,
November 6; Arlington, November 6;
Lexington, November 7; Pelham, No
vember 7; Mcßae, November 12.; New
nan, November 12; LaGrange, Novem
ber 13; Baxley, November 13; Barnes
ville, November 14; Lyons, November
14; Dublin, November 19; Statesboro,
November 20; Meldrim, November 21;
Madison, November 28.

The Conservation League of Amer
ica, whose, purpose is to stimulate in
terest in the preservation of our na
tural resources, is receiving pledges
of active support and co-operation
fiom nearly all the Congressional
candidates in the various States, and
expresses itself as highly pleased with
the result of their first efforts to ob
tain such support and co-operation.
The Gulf Coast Inland Waterway
Association will hold a convention in
Columbus, Georgia, November 9 and
10, at which the improvement of many
impoitant Southern rivers will be
considered.
About 8,000 farms in South Dakota
recently passed into the hands of the
lucky drawers for freeholds from the
Government. The tract partitioned
vas in the Rosebud Indian Reserva
tion. Over a hundred thousand per
sons attempted to draw the prize of
a home in this great lottery.
The jury in Springfield failed to
convict in the case of the recent riots
there.
Prof. Alaxime Kovalesky, member
of the Council of the Russian Empire,
makes the hopeful statement that the
great emancipating movement of his
people is steadily progressing. He
states that the peasantry are acquir
ing more land, that the radical Prot
estant sects are gaining in influence
over the bigoted Greek Catholic
Church and that enlightenment of the
people is growing.
The American fleet, after a joyous
time on the shores of Japan, has re
sumed its sail around the world.
The French are opposing an enter
ing wedge of the American Meat
Trust, in the proposed establishment
by an English and American Com
pany of markets which would com
pete with those of native firms and
are demanding that the laws be
amended to prohibit importation of
American cattle.
Judge Bethea, of Chicago, has es
tablished an admirable precedent in
the fine of $2,500 and sentence of two
years’ imprisonment imposed on Jo
seph Ochsner, convicted of connec
tion with the “white slave” traffic.
If the judges throughout the big
cities, wherein this execrable traffic
flourishes, would take a similar stand
and administer justice no less spar
ingly, a wholesome lesson would be
learned.
