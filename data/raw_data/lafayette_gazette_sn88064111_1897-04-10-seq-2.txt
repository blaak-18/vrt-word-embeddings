:j : just:
On the six of October, 89o, t
when the Treasury statement b
showed a surplus revenue for the
fiscal year ending June 30, of $85,
ooo,ooo, a tariff bill went into oper
ation under the title, "'A bill to i
reduce the revenue and equalize cc
duties on imports and for other e
purposes." In January, 1897, when w
a statement for the fiscal year end- d
ing June 3o, 1896, shows a defi- d
ciency in revenue of over $s,o000oo,- re
ooo, certain to be very much m
greater for the current year, a tariff tw
bill is introduced under the title, m
"A bill to provide revenue for the in
government and to encourage the del
industries of the United States.", ili
These bills are so nearly identical net
in general structure and particular wh
items, exceptmg as to the sugar its
schedule, that it may be well to of
consider the effect of the first bill
on the revenue of the country. inc]
Both bills are vast and voluminous gov
schemes of class taxation, the pro- revs
duction of public revenue being an spic
incident, and entirely subordinate, plis
to the purpose of taxing all the wit'
American people for the benefit of less4
a small part of the people. pros
The protectionist has but one and
remedy, which he applies whether duc
the revenue be redundant or defi- enhi
cient. If times are prosperous, and with
more money than is needed pours amo
into the Treasury, he increases that
taxes by a scheme that turns the they
larger parts of their avails into pri- the
vate pockets; and this reduces ate
public revenue.. If times are de- invam
pressed, and less money than is prote
needed pours into the Treasury, he Th
seizes the pretext of increasing cond
public revenue by adding enor- ultra
mouly to the amount of private ex- to
action, Any tax that passes di- plain:
rectly, and is controlled by some Dingl
favorite interest, from the tax- on th
payer to the government, is an year
abomination which he will never reven
permit, if he can help it, to remain it wol
upon the statute book. portal
The act of 189o, whatever its port
other effects, did reduce revenue. sum
From a large surplus it swept us nearly
headlong to a deficiency, although custor
it weighted the people with heavier one ye
taxes and although another law, And to

;es that the larger part of the taxes
he they pay are for the benefit, not of
ri- the government, but of the corpor
:es ate and consolidated wealth that
le- invaribly writes the schedules of a
is protective tariff.
he That the Dingley bill, present
ng condition considerated, is the most
ultra protective tariff ever proposed
to be enacted. in this country
li- plainly appears from Chairman
ie Dingley's statement that if levied
on the importations of the last fiscal Bro
n year it would have increased the
r revenue $112,ooo,ooo; that is to say
it would have gathered from an im
portation of $775,724,264 of im
:s ported merchandise the enormous
sum of $272,ooo,ooo, which is
s nearly fifty millions more than any
customs revenue ever collected in
r one year in this country in the past.
And to say that its rates will proba
bly check dutiable imports to the
extent of reducing the estimate of Do
$70oooo,ooo is only another way of
saying that to that extent such rates
are prohibitory.
American consumers are shut in
the home market, to be preyed
upon- by combinations and trusts, Gen
without possibility of relief from
outside competition. Such com
binations, by joining to keep up
prices and to curtail production,
wage more merciless war against
employment, opportunities and
the comp.ensation of American At th
labor than any possible competion That
from abroad could do. W W
The falling off of importations nd
under the present law dispels the marg
illusions that the American laborer
is anywhere deprived of employ
ment by the importation of foreign
products. The gratifying increase
in our exports of manufactures is
equally strong proof that those laws
are helping us to enter and com
mand new markets, which means
not only larger employment for our
artisans, but more home consumers
for our farmers.
