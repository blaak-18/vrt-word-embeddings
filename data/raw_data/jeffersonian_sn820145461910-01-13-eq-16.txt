Death of Comrade Mallett
Cleburne, Texas, Dec. 28, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson,
Editor Jeffersonian,
Thomson, Ga.
Hon. Sir: —By order of our Camp
I inclose you a copy of the memorial
adopted by our Camp at its last reg
ular meeting to the memory of our
dead comrade, Colonel J. M. Mallett.
Yours truly,
R. W. FERRELL,
Adjt. Pat Cleburne Camp No. 88,
U. C. V., Cleburne, Texas.
Under the order for the good of
the camp the following memorial
resolution was offered and adopted:
“To the Officers and Members Pat
Cleburne Camp No. 88, U. C. V.:
“Whereas, Death has again entered
our camp and removed from our
midst our esteemed friend and com
rade, James M. Mallett, a true friend,
a wise counsellor, an upright Chris
tian, and faithful soldier. Captain
Mallett entered the army as private
in Company E, Forty-first Brigade,
Sharp’s Division, Hindman’s Corps,
Army of Tennessee, and rose through
all the grades to captain and was
continuously with that army and in
all of its battles from Corinth to
Greensboro, N. C., when the star of
the Confederacy went down to rise
no more.
“When peace came, the war, with
Captain Mallett, was over, and from
that time to the close of his life,
every talent and power he possessed
was exerted for the rehabilitation of
the Southern country by the promo
tion of those policies and practices
that make a section or a nation
great.
“He was a conscientious man; he
strove to be right; having carefully
weighed a proposition, he formed an
opinion, and stood by it regardless of
the popular opinion; he was willing
to be with the minority if the mi
nority was right.
“He was an unobtrusive Christian,
observing the rule of dealing "with
men as he would have men deal with
him; therefore be it
“Resolved, That in the death of
Captain Mallett, the camp has lost
one of its truest and most valued
members and each of its members a
devoted friend, and that the sympa
thies of the camp be extended his
widow and all surviving relatives.
“C. V. CYRUS,
“R. W. FERRELL,
“H. W. BARCLAY,
“Committee.”
On motion the Adjutant was in
structed to send a copy of the above
resolution to The Jeffersonian, after
which many members spoke of their
love and respect for our dead Com
rade J. M. Mallett, and with sad
hearts all submitted their will to the
will of Him who doeth all things
well.
By order of the Commander the
camp was closed with a prayer by
Comrade C. V. Cyrus.

THE KETTLEDRUM ENJOYS AN
AFTERNOON WITH THOMAS.
WATSON.
The Kettledrum’s last meeting was
one of unusual interest and charm,
the hostess being Mrs. L. O. Dawson
and the subject, Thomas E. Watson,
the noted Georgian and a literary
light of the whole country. There
was a large attendance and the meet
ing was exceedingly pleasant.
The house was handsomely deco
rated with ferns and palms and cut
flowers and presented a most pic
turesque appearance. Mrs. Dawson
is a notably clever and gracious
hostess and her affairs are always
characterized by much individuality
and charming elegance. She was as-
Gbe 3effersonlan
sisted in receiving on this occasion
by her house guests, Mrs. Goodhue
and Miss Lurine Goodhue, of Gads
den, and Miss Sallie Lou Walker, of
Camphill.
The program consisted of a paper
on “Watson, a Literary Character,”
by Mrs. Henry Bacon Foster. The
other notable paper of the afternoon
was one on “Watson in His Home
Life,” by Mrs. J. Calhoun Harrison.
Both papers were greatly appreci
ated and gave a clear insight into
the life of this noted man. A per
sonal letter from Mr. Watson was
read to the club and was ordered
placed in the archives of the society
for preservation.
The delightful music for the after
noon was provided by Mrs. Harry N.
Eddins, who sang a couple of songs
in her most beautiful manner.
After the program a hot lunch
eon was served and greatly enjoyed
by the guests. The occasion was no
table in every way and will long
dwell as a pleasant memory in the
minds of all the Kettledrum and
their guests.—Tuscaloosa Times-Ga

A Novel of the Old South.
A Love Story of a Confederate Volunteer.
Jefferson Davis, Toombs, Hill, Yancey and
Stephens are living and breathing people in this
book. We hear them talk; we see them as they
really were.
“Bethany” was the name of the old church
where the town of Thomson, Ga., now flourishes.
This true story of love and war bears out the
proverb that “truth is stranger than fiction”.
