Minnesota Klorero Plans For Progress
WALTON OFFERS TO RESIGN
THE OKLAHOMA SWASHBUCKLER IS STILL
TRYING TO KEEP IN THE PUBLIC
Oklahoma
Cleared by Justice; Legislators
Ready to Impeach.
—K-K-K
Oklahoma City, Okla., Oct. 10.
—Rioting charges against N. C.
Jewitt, grand dragon of the Ktf
Klux Klan in Oklahoma, and two
other men were dismissed late
today by Justice of the Peace,
Leo B. White after a prelimin
ary hearing.
The charges grew out of the
flogging here more than a year
ago of E. R. Merriman.
The Oklahoma legislature
completed final arrangements to
night for launching impeach
ment proceedings against Gov
ernor J. C. Walton.
In separate caucuses, both
houses of the assembly chose
their leaders for the special ses
sion which begins Thursday and
afterwards the legislators an
nounced they were ready for the
fray.
K-K-K
Oklahoma City, Okla. —Governor J.
C. Walton wants to show his good
faith in his fight against the Ku Klux
Klan. How does he want to show
his good faith? The despot feels
himself slipping on the plank which
the people of Oklahoma greased most
plentifully, and in one last frantic
effort shouts for a “chance to show
good faith.” Being a very “bashful”
man, “Jack” just couldn’t say it loud
enough—-well, anyway, he will step
down from his throne, providing the
legislature passes an anti-Klan law.
Dictator to the last breath of his po
litical life, he will be—that now is
clear.
With the legislature in special ses
sion by rights from the people, now
an absolute certainty, Walton knows
that on the tomorrow he’ll need a job
and wants his anti-Klan supporters
to believe that he was sincere in his
“bulldoggery,” and, therefore, enti
tled to a splendid position. * Not for
a minute did he expect Oklahomans,
as a whole, to pay much attention to
his “dictation,” as laid before the
legislature; the legislators are
laughing right out loud, for the man
is actually getting “funnier” every
day.
Walton Burning Midnight Oil
The Oklahoma governor must be
taking a correspondence course in
“bill-writing.” We are quite sure
that Alcohol Smith of New York is
seeing to it that “Jack” gets the
course absolutely free. It is hard,
perhaps, to learn who agists King
Jack I in his lessons, but it is evi
dent that he has learned a little
about the “New York Way” which
was born in the mind of foreignism
now dominating New York.
Walton’s Bill a la K. C.
Briefly, the governor’s bill pro
hibits the use of the mask by secret
organizations in Oklahoma and pro
vides that all such orders shall file
complete membership lists with the
regularly appointed civil authorities.
Walton knows very well that his
bill will not, as a law, “kill” the Ku
Klux Klan in Oklahoma any more
than a similar law in New York end
ed the Klan there. It is, therefore,
apparent that the Oil State execu
tive is still “acting” for the benefit
of the “outside.”
The members of the Oklahoma leg
islature seem to be unanimously op
posed to accepting the executive’s
terms or taking any dictation fronl
him from now on.
-K-K-K
Oklahoma City, Okla.—Oklahoma
has spoken—and in no uncertain
tones. The citizenship of this state,
represented and lead by the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan, demands the
impeachment of Governor Jack Wal
ton and the end of “Waltonism.”
The people still rule. A republican
form of government still prevails and

the vast majority of Oklahomans will
not be denied their inalienable rights
as Americans by a few demagogues,
politicians and self-seekers.
At this moment Walton is trying to
find some legal loophole through
which he may jump and so escape the
indictments of a righteously enraged
people. His injunctions, appeals, and
other legal maneuvers mean nothing,
however, except that he would con
tinue to act the despot by refusing to
bow to the will of a constituency
that demands nothing less than his
immediate removal from the political
arena of the state to which he al
most brought disgrace.
His impeachment will be brought
about immediately.
It is conceded here that had it not
been for the Ku Klux Klan Walton
would have intimidated the citizen
ship into submission to his tyrannical
mandates. The Klan’s Lincolnian
slogan that this is “A government of
the people, by the people, for the peo
ple” was made manifest here Tuesday
when thousands of emergency officers
sworn into duty from the one hundred
per cent Americans of the Klan, made
possible a public election that the
despot would have prevented by
force of arms because his “throne”
was at stake.
The election, recognized as legal by
the Secretary of State and practically
every state and county official, with
the exception of a few of the Gover
nor’s personal appointees only indi
cated the public’s attitude as to the
desirability of Walton’s impeachment
by a four to one vote, but showed that
his financial integrity was questioned.
A bonus bill that would have plac
ed $55,000,000 in the governor’s
hands for expenditures was also de
feated. Of this total $30,000,000 was
to have been used in making loans
for home building, etc., and it was
generally understood that only those
who were “right” would receive loans.
The governor had hoped to get his
hands on the $55,000,000 before the
Federal government voted a bonus
for all veterans.
Another question which, if carried,
might have cost $15,000,000, was
state question No. 125, refunding to
depositors all the money stolen or
lost by incompetent bankers in the
state banks which failed. The ad
ministration of this fund also would
have helped to build up a political
machine.
Both measures were defeated.
Arouses Bitter Feeling
The Governor’s fight against the
Klan has not only kept this state un
der martial law for weeks, but has
aroused a bitterness betwen racial
and religious groups that will result
in strife and bloodshed for a genera
tion to come. Before he launched his
publicity-seeking’ campaign against'’
the Klan this state had few trou
bles other than those caused by the
immune ans pardoned criminals who
operated under the protection of
“Waltonism.” Now the public is de
termined to use aggressive measures
to wipe out “Waltonism.” The hon
or of the state will now be preserved
even if some one is hurt in the effort”
say the best citizens and most loyal
Americans. <
The keynote of the situation was
sounded by Rev. H. C. Williams, pas
tor of the University Place Christian
church, who said:
“When the facts are known, as they
surely will be, the present governor
will be found only a tool of an in
visible government which seeks to de
stroy American institutions, the pub
lic schools and the right to worship
God according to the dictates of con
science.
“He ruthlessly has trampled under
foot rights which the Constitution
has guaranteed should never be de
nied; he has attempted to bring
odium upon our courts and law-en
forcing officers by releasing men
charged with contempt of court; he
has nullified their efforts to bring
criminals to justice. Without reason
or necessity he has engaged in riot

—K-K-K
Reading, Pa.—Emulating the spirit
of the Carnegie mob rioters, who
caused the death of one Klansman
and wounded many others, a bi
goted mob waited to attack members
of the Ku Klux Klan and others who
were invited at a public meeting of
the order last week, assembled in
Odd Fellows Hall, Bth and Franklin
streets.
During the progress of the meeting
a big crowd of aniti-Klan sympathiz
ers gathered in front of the building
in which the meeting took place. They
were waiting for the close in order to
make the attack on those inside.
Some o*f the law violators, unable to
restrain their impatience, hurled
bricks and stones through the win
dows. One man was seriously in
jured and several women fainted.
Mob Waits Outside
After the assemblage was dismiss
ed the real trouble began. Those who
had been waiting outside the hall
stood in close formation at the en
trance to the building and began
hooting and jeering the men leaving
the meeting. At the same time some
of the mob began following those who
had been in the hall.’ So intent was
the vicious mob on administering
physical punishment to the Klansmen
that many leaving in automobiles
were pursued by vindictive Roman
Catholic sympathizers. Those who
left the building on foot were follow
ed also. From the time the meeting
disbanded until long after midnight
the vindictiveness of the mob held
fulls way. Many of those who were
eyewitnesses marveled that the cas
ualties were not even greater than
the Carnegie affair. It required the
full power of the police force of the
city to control the situation.
Excitement Prevails
The meeting itself was he scene of
some considerable excitement. The
Rev. Fair, who Klansmen say belies
his name, .attended the meeting for
the purpose, it is said, of creating
trouble and making himself conspic
uous at the same time. This minis
ter recently spoke at the annual ban
quet of the Lions club, at which
time he took occasion to assail the
Klan and in his remarks stated that
he hoped if the Klan attempted to
parade in Reading that the citizens
“would give them the same treat
ment they received in Carnegie, Pa.,
last month.” Despite his known op
position, to the Klan, he was invited
tb make a prayer. He declined the
invitation. Later, during the course
of the main speaker’s talk, a man
who sat behind the Rev. Fair asked
his opinion of the actions of the mob
when a brick was thrown through the
window. The supposed man of peace
replied to the question that “there
would be more than that happening
if the meetings were not discontin
ued.” This man then called Rev.
Fair “yellow,” which greatly aroused
his ire. H$ jumped to his feet, ex
claiming that he had spilled his life’s
blood in France and from his actions
indicated that he was going to spill 1
some more of it in America. Level
headed persons in the audience suc
ceeded in quieting the parties to the
controversy. At the close of the
meeting the speaker asked for some
minister to offer prayer. The/ Rev.
Fair showed his respect for his
brother of the cloth and religion by
remaining seated while the prayer
was offered.
Under the historical old elm at
Corydon, in the shade of which was
framed the Constitution of Indiana
more than one hundred years ago,
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
held a meeting last week that was
attended by thousands of patriotic
Americans. That the Klan is growing
there was seen in the large attendance
and the enthusiasm displayed by
those present.

PIPESTONE (LAN
ISSUES K MONTHLY
“KALUMET KLAN KRONICLE”
MADE ITS INITIAL APPEAR
ANCE ON OCTOBER 1
—K-K-K
A small but “peppy” monthly pub
lished by the Pipestone County Klan
made its initial appearance, October
first.
It is needless to say that the antis
became somewhat bewildered when
they first picked up a copy of the
“Kalumet Klan Kronicle.” We can
hear the “haters” talk in whispers,
as they look nervously in every direc
tion, “The men who sent out that
darn sheetlet ought to be driven from
our county.” Of course, it would be
natural to expect that the “snappers”
will do everything in their power to
intimidate any and all real Ameri
cans actively applying the principles
of Klankraft. Pipestone County
Klansmen, however, do not fear the
devil and all his co-workers, so will
go ahead ever mindful of what it
means to be a militant American and
Protestant.
On the front page under the head
line “Pipestone County Keep Faith”
we read, “Pipestone county has kept
faith with the pioneers of old, join
ing hands with a' pioneer cause—the
Ku Klux Klan. This summer has
witnessed the burning of four crosses,
each one of which gave out in its
fiery light the message of Pipestone’s
progress.”

A class of 26 candidates were natural

from live gas wells. This wonderful

Bloomingdale, Mich. A large

week to hear a well-known speaker

Ku Klux Klan in which the principles
of that organization were explained
thoroughly, much to the approval of
the crowd.
Membership in the order here is
on the rapid increase and was fur

speech.
A fiery cross was burned and

KLAN DELEGATES FROM EVERY PART
OF MINN. ASSEMBLE AT ST. PAUL
Klansmen Leave Convention Determined To
Place The Gopher State High
in Klandom.
Klans in all parts of Minnesota
send delegates to state Klorero called
at St. Paul, October 7.
On the evening of the 6th the dele
gates then in the Saintly City were
invited to a frolic, where St. Paul
Klansmen royally entertained their
visiting brothers putting on a series
of “stunts” that brought continuous
uproars of laughter. It is rumored
that many Klansmen spent the “wee”
hours of the “‘morning after” sew
ing vest buttons to their proper
places on the quite useful part of a
man’s clothes. Klansmen present at
the Saturday evening session all
agree that they had a “crackajack”
of a time and look forward to the
next statewide meeting of hundred
percenters.
The Sunday all-day session began
at 10:30 A. M. The morning meet
ing was devoted to introductions, so
that Klgns officials and laymen might
get better acquainted with one an
other. At this meeting it was re
vealed that twenty-seven fieldwork
ers were now acive in the state and
that many more were ready to begin
work in a few days, thus bringing
the number of organizers in the state
considerably over thirty. We heard
many delegates state that they were
much pleased to learn that men of
weight and manly fiber were serv
ing the Great Movement as field
workers. And it’s a fact that there
isn’t a scapegoat in the ranks of the
K. K. K. organizers active on the
“battle front.” We certainly are
glad that real men answer the call
for service in the cause of Klankraft.
The afternoon meeting was one
filled with inspiration. The King'
Kleagle for Minnesota went into
detail on matters pertaining to or
ganization, laying out carefully the
machinery necessary for ani active
Klan. Many were surprised to learn
how simply and effective an intricate
organization can function when
Klansmen are alert, and aroused to
the tremendous demands of Ameri
canism. v
The King KlEagle pointed out
that the Invisible Empire calls for
unselfish service. He said, “The
Klan is not a one-man organization,
but a movement made effective
through co-operation.” The King
KlEagle emphasized the importance
of a membership which understands
fully that many real men can accom
plish more than a few. He urged the
need for a united Protestantism
overflowing with love for God, Home
and Country. Throughout his ad
dress the head of Minnesota Klan
dom stressed the need for a vision
clear enough to bring the realization
that the Ku Klux Klan as a move-
WILLMAR HEARS
KLAN LECTURE
—K-K-K
Willmar, Minn.—Mr. Orn, editor of
the “Call of the North,” spoke to a
large audience of men and women at
the Basonic Temple here, last Thurs
day.
It is estimated that twice as many
people had to be turned away as
were able to find room in the Ma
sonic Temple auditorium. Mr. Orn
was persuaded to remain for a meet
ing on Friday and was again greeted
by a filled auditorium.
Several “rank outsiders” came to
the Friday evening meeting for the
specific purpose of causing all possi
ble trouble, but were “politely” in
vited to leave and did so “frothing
at the mouth.” When these “Snoop
ing Snuts” gained the street, they
cursed most “beautifully,”, damning
the speaker and the Klan most “de
lightfully.”

unite with the many Klansmen now

ment overshadowed personalities and
beautifully crystallized the elements
that make the United States a great
and powerful nation.
Plans were laid before the Klan
convention for a strenuous winter
campaign. When the challenge of
Klankraft was expressed by the King
KlEagle, the delegation answered
emphatically • with an enthusiastic
outburst of applause, indicating in a
convincing manner that big things
could be expected from Minnesota
Klansmen. At this time, a Novem
ber meeting was discussed, that
should embrace the Klans of the en
tire state. On the eleventh day of
November (the Bth anniversary of
the Klan), the next statewide K. K.
K. meeting will take place. By No
vember 5,000 or more men will be
ready for initiation into the myste
ries of Klankraft. The place for the
meeting has not yet been definitely
decided.
An official letter was read before
the convention stating that the Sim
mons and Evans factions have been
brought together on an amicable
basis, thus removing an internal dis
cord, which enemies of the Klan have
sought to capitalize by making a
mountain of a molehill. At the con
clusion of the letter a wild stampede
of cheers and handclaps burst forth,
indicating the happiness which came
with the news that conciliation had
been at last brought about.
A committee was appointed to
draw up a formal expression of the
convention’s delight on learning that
the Imperial officers were once more
working together peacefully and har
moniously. The formal expression
which was unanimously adopted fol

Klankraft.
At six o’clock the Klansmen dele

subjects of special interest to Klans
men, but not intehded for those not
concerned.
Shortly after 9 P. M. Klansmen
began getting ready for their home

no man left the convention without a
greater enthusiasm for the move

result in wonderful strides forward

Minnesota Klansmen are more fully

MONTANA IS LATEST
REALM IN EMPIRE
—K-K-K
Following on the heels of Arizona,
Indiana and Illinois, Montana is the
latest state to become an organized
realm of the Invisible Empire.
The Realm of Montana was con
stituted and organized September 16,
last, at a meting of Montana Klans
men held at Livingston with the
Imperial Klazik presiding. The
growth of the Klan in this western
state has been rapid during the past
few months tand under the direction
of its own state officers the member
ship is expected to increase more
speedily than ever before.
At the Livingston Klorero, dele
gates were present from Klans at
Helena, Boseman, Kalispell, Glas
gow, Red Lodge, Bute, Lewistown,
Havre, Terry, Harlowton, Missoula,
Great Falls, Miles City, and Roundup.
The Grand Dragon of the Realm
of Montana and his Great Titans and
Hydras were chosen at the meeting.
Montana is divided into four prov
inces. The Grand Dragon is a well
known business man of Livingston.
The gathering was a most enthusias
tic one.
