WASHINGTON, D. C., April 17
Representative La Guardia, an Ital
ian congressman from New York, who
is fighting the Johnson immigration
kill with all his might and main, is
evidently a reader of the Fienr
Cross, for he knows what is being said
In various editions of The Fiery Cross
and he put a lot of it in the Con
gressional Record in his speech on
April 8.
Just bear in mind as you read what
he says, that La Guardia is of Italian
stock, he himself is a member of the
•rder Sons of Italy, which is in itself
un-American, redictic, requires the
Italian language to be spoken in its
lodge rooms, etc. Representative
Raker, of California, asked him about
this, and La Guardia lied when he
said what he did in reply, just as he
lied recently on the flooor of the
house to Congressman Johnson, au
thor of the bill, and as a result the
house considered his (La Guardia)
changing his remarks before printing
same in the Record, so that he falsi
fied the Record in making the
changes
After the Ku Klux
Mr. La Guardia in his April 8 speech
said in par.: “A great deal has been
said about the foreign press. The
foreign press is not the only kind of
press taking an interest in this prop
osition. I nave here in my hands a
publication which ‘has featured re
strictive immigration legislation for
a long time. If you will read The
Fiery Cross of January 18, 1924, you
will find there an alarming headline
entitled: ‘Americans’ Heritage Men
aced, Says Dr. Evans;’ and who is Dr.
Evans? Why The Fierv Cross says
that he is no less than their Imperial
Wizard, Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan, and a five-column article car
rying the Imperial Wizard’s views,
opinions, and instructions to Con
gress printed in detail in the Fiery
Cross publication of the hooded
knights. Then the Irnperial Wizard
says (quoted from Dr. Evans’ article)
• * •, etc.
Reads Fiery Cross
“And in The Fiery Cross of Friday,
March 28, 1924, we find that the ener-
Eetic gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Ca
le, put the floor leader of the ma
jority on record and required him to
do so in writing, according to the
news report in the flaming paper, and
I read:
“ *Congressinan Cable one of
the sponsors of the immigration
bill, was determined that a vote
be urged with the least possible
delay, so he obtained the follow
ing written statement from Mr.
Longworth.’
‘Then we find the written promise
was the statement given to the press
by Mr. Ijongworth in outlining the
legislative program of the house some
ten days ago, and I quote from the
so-called written promise as contained
in the paper:
“The immigration bill will be
considered immediately follow
ing the passage of these bills.’ ”
The bills referred to being the
regular appropriation bills.
Crack* at Dayton
‘Then turning the pages of The
Fiery Cross to the editorial section,
we nnd this startling pronunciamen
to:
“ ‘For those wno might not be
aware of it, it might be stated
here that Ohio is one of the chief
strongholds of the Klan, ranking
next to Indiana, which at this
time leads the nation in Klan
dom. Taking Ohio as a single
unit, Dayton is one of the strong
est Klan cities in Ohio. Dayton
is “Klan all through.’”

“And then let me read the next
editorial criticizing one of the great
New York dailies. The Brooklyn
Eagle, and it is not necessary for me
to go to the defense of that great
daily. There is no better, more loyal
nor square daily in this whole coun
try than The Brooklyn Daily Eagle.
That paper is not of bi-political faith
not of my school of politics. It often
criticizes me and does so squarely,
but I will say right here that its own
ership. its editorial staff, is of the
very highest type of Americans, and
nothing that may be said by the Fi
ery Cross can in the slightest affect
the standing of that paper or its per
sonnel. But let me read:
'“The entire country is aware
that the Catholic and the Jew
are for unrestricted immigration.
Americans, however, are not.
They see the deadly menace that
faces America at this critical
time. It is possible that the ed
itor of The Eagle, too, sees the
menace; but with less than 1.000.-
000 people who are of white,
Protestant. Gentile, American
extraction in a city of approxi
mately 6,000,000 souls, it is only
natural that The Eagle should
play to the overwhelming ma
jority.
“ There is hardly any doubt
but that the editor really meant
the people of New York City are
not for it. Some kind person
should send the Eagle editor a
map of the United States that
he might learn that America on
ly starts in New York and runs
clear to the Pacific ocean before
stopping. Also inform hirn that
the opinion of “the average New
Yorker” is not necessarily the
opinion of the millions of Ameri
cans west of Jersey City.’
“I read these quotations to show
the warp-minded attitude of the of
ficial organ of the hooded organiza
tion and to demonstrate the one-sid
edness of its argument; why, gentle
men. every member of this house
knows that the word of the floor
leader is his bond.
New Yorker Badly Stung
"The Fiery Cross of April 4, 1924,
states that thousands of letters are
being received by Mr. Johnson from
New York, and that New Yorkers
complain that they have to depend
upon Congesstnan Johnson and upon
the efforts of the Ku Klux Klan, be
cause their representatives in Con
gress are going to vote against the
bill.
I.a Guardia Scared
“Why, gentlemen, I have a whole
file full of the publications, and I
say to you that the leaders responsi
ble for the activities of the Ku Klux
Klan are doing more to divide the
country and to divide the people of a
country than any agency that ever ex
isted in the history of the world.
These arguments are read all over
the coutnry. You cannot prevent the
people of the east forming their opin
ion of this organization.
Lu Guardla Haves
‘They cannot understand how you
can stand up for Americanism, how
you want to shut the doors against
those who you believe do not under-;
stand American traditions and how,
in the darkness of night, these same
people, with masks or hoods, will
take some poor defenseless negro and
chastise him by corporal punishment
or by hanging him, and burning down
the houses of the poor undefended
negro they cannot understand why,
in order to create law and fear, to es
tablish brutal dominance, it is neces
sary to burn the very symbol of Chris
tianity which they have been brought
up from infancy to worship; they can
not understand why it is that this
organization has directed its activi
ties and the power of its organized
force at a group of people, at races,
and religions who are defenseless,
who want to take their place in the
one big American family. Do you
not see the harm that is being done,
what irreparable harm is being done,
and in the name of the same God we
all worship and for the glory of our
flag? I ask the Ku Klux Klan to
take off their mask and to meet us
in the light of day to talk these
things over and to act in accordance
with the best interests and in accord
ance with the tradition and spirit of
America.”
La Luanda Trapped
Just as Mr. La Guardia closed ti
above speech. Representative Raker,
of California, popped up. and this is
what happened:
Mr. Raker: Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. La Guardia: Certainly.
Mr. Raker: Would the gentleman
mind telling the committee, if he
knows, about an organization com
posed of about 1200 lodges with about
150,000 members to which you cannot
belong unless you speak and write a
foreign tongue?
And La Guardia. the Italian con
gressman from New York, dodged the
question.
ALIEN QUOTA FIXED
AT TWO PER CENT
(Continued from page 1)
corner of the country have answered
the call, and the fight has been prac
tically won so far as congress is con
cerned. Coagrees refused to bew the
knee to alien influence. It certainly
is notice to the outside world that no
interference from other nations or
powers will be tolerated. America is
to be kept for Americans.
At the same time this newspaper
wants to be fair to all concerned and
to give praise where praise is due.
Six Catholics and a Jewish member
of congrees voted for the bill in the
house. Mrs. Mae Nolan, Catholic,
from California, and Representative
Rosenbloom, from Weet Virginia,
proved that they are real Americans
and good patriots when they cast
their votes for the immigration hill.
They ignored the fact that their
church and religious societies were
the most active opponents of the 1890
census. They voted for the bill be
cause they believed that the 1890 cen
sus was the best thing for America.
The other five Catholics voting for
the bill were Ben Johnson, of Ken
tucky; James O’Connor and I^adislas 1
Lazaro, of Louisiana; Sydney E. Mudd,
of Maryland; and Nicholas J. Sinnott,
of Oregon. The efforts of these pa
triotic men and women to safeguard
the American people will be appreci
ated and revered by all Americans,
regardless of race, creed or color.
Americans on Guard
WASHINGTON. D. C„ April 18
“Let none but Americans De placed
on guard,” is holding true in the sen
ate just as it held true in the house
of representatives when it comes to
the immigration measure. Americans
are on guard in both houses of con
gress and are controlling the situa
tion perfectly. Alien congressmen
and senators are getting the licking
of their lives in the immigration
fight, and Americans are winning at
every turn.
The New York-Chicago delegations,
most of whom represent alien con
stituents, who have been making the
fight for them on the immigration
question are going down to defeat on
every vote. Dr. Royal Copeland.
United States senator from New
York, who recently declared in a
speech delivered in his home city
that the Johnson immigration bill
would never pass the senate, got what
he was not looking for yesterday in
the senate when he introduced an
amendment to fix the immigration
quota at 3 per cent on the basis of
the 1910 census. The senate turned
him down cold, to the tune of 72 to 8.
Wanted One Per Cent Law
At one stage the senate had gone
on record for a record low immigra
tion total of 80,000 —represented by
1 per cent on the census of 1890.
This was later reconsidered and 2
per cent upon the census of 1890 was
approved by the senate as the basis
of immigration apportionment, thus
bringing the senate bill into exact
agreement with the Johnson bill as
it passed the house. This was the sec
tion of the bill which it was felt
would produce the most controversy
in conference, but now both houses
are agreed upon this fundamental
provision and it looks like clear sail
ing for immigration in the senate
just the way the 100 per cent Ameri
cans want it.
As it now stands, the senate bill is
exactly similar to that of the house,
even to Japanese exclusion and other
important provisions. Two items will
have to be threshed out in confer
ence, however, the authority for cer
tain “exceptions” from quota re
strictions given in the house bill, and
the senate provision for a national
ity group survey to be made by a de
partmental commission by July 1,
1927. The latter would have the ef
fect, senators said, of limiting the
life of the pending bill to three
years.
In Memoriam
WAHKON, MINN, April 16.—Will
iam Robertson of this place was hur
led here today with the Reverend Mr.
Fink officiating, using the Ku Klux
Klan burial rites. During the funer
al services, the Presbyterian church
of this village was packed to the
doors, and many were unable to get
beyond the door of entrance. Friends
nnd relathes of Klansuian Robertson
came from near and far to pay trib
ute to his memory. This Is the first
time In the history of Minnesota that
a Klansman was hurled by the Invls
lble Empire.
The Rev. Mr. Fink preached a ser
mon which penetrated to the hearts
of all the people who were gathered
In the church. Many men who have
been walking the trails that lead to
darkness were awakened by the mes
sage of the Klansman-mlnlster and
have openly expressed themselves as
ready to forsake the service of Satan
and turn to the living Christ and beg
of Him a complete forgiveness of
their sins and an opportunity to serve
worthily. Perhaps there has never
been as Impressive a funeral service
In or near Wahkon as conducted by
the Klan here today.
Mr. Robinson was born In Bath
connty, Kentucky, on October 12,
IN2H. He came to Minnesota 12 years
ago. He has lived In retirement for
a number of years. Although well
along In years, Klansman Robertson
was abreast of the times and ever
took a keen Interest In the affairs of
the nation. Those who knew the de
ceased Intimately, say that for his
years he possessed a mind of unusual
virility. He was a member of the
Methodist church and Is known to
have always recognised the necessity
of Hi lug lu accordance with the prin
ciples of the Man of Nasareth. He
leaves to mourn his departure four
teen children, and many relatives liv
ing In various parts of the United
States. We extend to those who
mourn the departure of Mr. Robert
son our deepest sympathy.
The plan of this commonwealth was
Islu on the shores of the blue Lake
of Galileo, when the Savior of the
World made it clasr that in God's
■(lint sil human baings coma under
the some laws of common fairness
and spiritual equality.

LABOR WEEKLY IS
AGAINST THIRD PARTY
(Continued from page 1)
M lf both old parties surrender to
Wall Street, the Cleveland convention
will know how to meet the situation.”
In connection with the warning
sent out by “Labor” the Pioneer Pres#
says editorially:
“It should be noted here that the
part of the Farmer-Labor movement
which opposes the federation and Mr.
Mahoney do not favor the June 17
convention, but propose to join the
Conference for Progressive Political
Action at Cleveland on July 4; that
is, proposes to wait and see what the
old parties do, to work through them
if possible, to go it alone if not. The
third party movement therefore is
already badly disrupted.
“Labor, the weekly newspaper
owned and edited by the sixteen chief
labor unions, and which speaks for
organized labor, has flatly repudiated
the June 17 convention and with it
the Farmer-Labor federation and Mr.
Mahoney and all that goes with them.
“This movement/ says Labor, ‘has
been launched under most unfortun
ate auspices. A small but very act
ive band of communists is in control
of the arrangements, and, of course,
that means that the recognized labor
movement will have nothing to do
with the affair/ It stands strongly
for the Cleveland convention on July
4. and warns organized labor that the
backers of the June 17 convention
are not its friends.
“The Minnesota Daity Star repeats
the advice of L*oor. ‘Stay away from
the St. Paul convention/ says the
Star. ‘What then,’ asks The Star,
‘will be the iesult if the farmers of
the northwest fall for the trap the
communists have carefully baited and
set for them. They will find that
they have lost the support of many
thousands of working men and wom
en who would otherwise go with them
and have taken aboard a soviet crew
of a few hundred whose announced
purpose is to steal the party from
those who formed it?’ ”
The Minneapolis Tribune also ex
pressed itself editorially in regard to
the statement of “Labor.” We are
reprinting the Tribune editorial in
its entirety:
“Sixteen railroad labor organiza
tions are warned in ‘Labor,’ a publica
tion owned by them, to keep them
selves and their skirts clear of the
convention of the so-called third par
ty to be held in St. Paul beginning
June 17. The editorial admonishment
has it that arrangements for this
gathering are in the hands of ‘a
small but vey active band of com
munists/ and a little further on the
editor says:

AMERICAN BLUE FRONT
322 East Fifth Street Dee Moioee. lowa
“‘Americans are prepared to make
a winning fight against the dictator
ship of plutocrats, but they have no
patience with rattle-brained gentle
men who talk silly twaddle about a
dictatorship of the proletariat/
“It is interesting to note, as Labor
informs us, that ‘the conference for
progressive political action has called
a national convention for July 4 in
Cleveland/ which, we are told, ‘will
be a thoroughly representative gath
ering and authorized to speak for
large groups of organized farmers
and industrial workers/
“Both the Republican and Demo
cratic national conventions will have
been held before the Cleveland con
vention here referred to. This sched
ule opens up quite a bit of political
cogitation. It is well to bear in mind,
for instance, that the big railroad la
bor organizations have been very
friendly to William G. McAdoo, be
ginning with that gentleman’s war
time railroad administration when
wages of railroad employes went up
sharply and the payrolls were great
ly enlarged in membership. Mr. Mc-
Adoo has made more headway toward
the Democratic presidential nomina
tion to date than any other man.
How far he will be able to carry his
cause in the New York convention is
problematical, but his following will
make a lot of noise from the outset.
Organized railroad labor will watch
with keen interest the development
of events in Madison Square Garden.
It is also noteworthy that Senator
I.aFollette has not tied himself up
in any public way with the St. Paul
convention of June 17. which comes
just after the Republican convention
and just before the Democratic con
vention. From the senator’s head
quarters in Washington has gone
forth a platform with enough planks
in it to accommodate all the forces
of discontent, including what Labor
calls the ‘small but very active band
of communists’ in charge of arrange
ments for the St. Paul gathering.
The LaFollette group is shrewdly
holding itself free to formulate a
party of its own. It prefers for the
time being to speak vaguely of ‘an
independent party’ rather than the
more specific term Farmer-Labor par
ty used in connection with the St.
Paul convention. This group is well
aware of the kindly feeling which or
ganied labor entertains toward Mr.
McAdoo and it is the logic of things
political that it should wish to see
what are the line-ups of the two old
parties as to candidates and plat
forms before it formulates its own
political medium for popular appeal.
“Still another thought is that there
is no common rallying cry as yet
to which labor or the opposition to
one or both of the old parties re
sponds.”
Friday, April 25,1924
CONGRESS RESENTS
JAPANESE NOTE
(Continued from page 1)
ate still claims that the Japan am
bassador’s letter contained a veiled
threat, and the U. S. senate does not
propose to be threatened or coerced
by anyone. It even resents the us*
of the Big Stick which President
Coolidge is trying to wield on the
upper branch of congress in order Up
move legislation aad stop all thi»
investigating business that has taken
up all the time for over four month*.
Trie senate takes the attitude that
it is not going to permit any foreign
power to tell us what to do about
our own immigration business. And
it is not going to yield to any threats
Only one voice was raised in thw
senate in behalf of Japan, and that
was that of Senator Sterling, of
South Dakota, who was recently de
feated for renomination. He took
the position that the Japanese am
bassador did not mean his protest aa
a threat, and argued that our position
taken in the senate would tend tn
disturb business relations between
the United States and Japan. Sen
ator Sterling and Chairman Colt, of
the senate immigration committee,
of Rhode Island, were the only two
negative votes cast in the senate.
No one can say just what is going:
to happen, but the writer is not an
alarmist in any sense of the word,
and does not believe that Japan will
construe this exclusion act as un
friendly. Secretary Hughes tried hi*
best to stem the tide more than m
month ago, but failed, as the big ma
jorities show. California insists that
the Japanese immigration has be
come a menace to the Pacific coast,,
and that instead of Japan carrying
out its contract to see that the Unit
ed States was not deluged with Jap
anese that the immigration from that
country has more than doubled pre
vious figures under this so-called
“gentleman’s agreement.” Naturally
they are sore, and resent this viola
tion on the part of Japan.
The next move in this controversy
is up to Japan. Dispatches f?om To
kio indicate that there is grave con
cern there over the matter. Con
gress has spoken, and there is some
talk that the Japanese ambassador
may be recalled by his country oi»
the theory that he pulled a “boner’*
in his threat letter.
At any rate there are mighty few
people in Washington who profess to
see anything like severing of diplo
matic relations or going to war over
this matter. Japan’s heavy losse*
from the recent earthquake, to say
nothing of her crippled condition!
financially on account of other war*
in which she has been engaged, will
likely say her hand if she is likely
to get aroused over this Japanese ex
clusion act.
It all reverts back to the original
question. If the United States, feel
ing as it does about this immigrations
question, seeks to put a stop to it or"
slow it up so as to protect America
herself, what’s wrong about thatT
And why haven’t we a right to have
our say about who shall come here
and how many? There are too many
foreigners in this country anyway,
and we have too many men in con
gress of the La Guardia type who
