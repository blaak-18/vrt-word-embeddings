FOR A WHITE MAN’S PARTY.
To the Publishers of the Jeffersonian,
Atlanta, Ga.
Gentlemen:—l enclose herewith
$1 for Watson’s Jeffersonian Maga
zine. I am already a subscriber to
the Weekly. Heretofore I have de
pended on getting the Magazine from
the newsstands, but they no longer
keep them in this unenlightened
burg.
I wish to thank you for at least
three articles appearing in the Week
ly of April 8. I refer to Mr. Mc-
Chandless’ article, “The Solid South,”
which should be reproduced by every
Southern editor and should be read
by or to every Southern boy and
man.
Then that short letter from the ex-
Federal soldier of Hines Ala., J. M.
Allen. How I would love to clasp
hands with that old Yank. It cer
tainly does an old man like me good
to meet up with an old Yankee who
sticks to principles regardless of pen
sions and censure of the so-called
“loyal.” Why, I wouldn’t mind be
ing licked by them half so badly if
all Federal soldiers were J. M. Allens.
The third article was “Southern
Womanhood,” an editorial copied
from the Rip Saw. Talk of paying
SIOO for a “prize essay” of “perfect
English” insults and eulogizes. A
present of SIOO from Southern peo
ple to the Rip Saw would be but
small appreciation of a Northern ed
itor honest enough and fearless
enough to attack one of the many lies
published by enemies of the South.
I have before called attention to
the advisability and actual necessity
of a systematic attempt to answer
and expose the infamous articles con
tinually appearing in the Northern
press. What’s needed is to answer
the lies and remove the ignorance of
things Southern that prevails at the
North; that would eventually bring
“true history.” For forty years
nearly every Northern paper seems
to think its duty is to educate the
people to hate anything and every
thing Southern. Every one who has
traveled at all extensively in the
North knows how thoroughly their
teachings have taken possession of
the masses. Even so-called Demo
cratic papers freely give their space
to any renegade who can write a
scurrilous article about the white
people of the South. Every day we
are humiliated by having to read mis
statements, insinuations, slurs and
infamous lies without the privilege of
reply, unless it be in a Southern pa
per, which but few Northern people
ever see, and our people continue to
ignore the effect of such articles and
fail to answer the lies as did our
fathers forty years before ignore and
refuse to answer attacks upon them
and slavery until forced to arms in
self-defense —all over a horde of be
ings a few degrees above the mon
key that the South was as anxious to
be rid of (and would have been rid
of by gradual emancipation) as was
the New Englander to steal them
from the African jungles to sell, or
from the South to set free.
I only wish some one with more
influence and ability than I would
take up the matter of answering our
enemies with the Daughters of the
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
Confederacy, for I know if they once
see the necessity of an organized
movement to stop the wrong teach
ings by answering and exposing those
slanders daily appearing in the pa
pers and take the matter in hand
they will devise a system that will
soon cover the entire country. If
space can be bought in a number of
Northern papers and used for an
swering every attack, in a short time
a wonderful change will be wrought
in our favor. I certainly believe
Southern people will gladly respond
with plenty of money for such a pur
pose if the Daughters or other prop
er parties will take it in charge.
And, to show my confidence in the
success and great benefit of such a
movement, I will be one of one hun
dred to give five, ten or twenty-five
dollars to help start a systematic
movement of the kind.
As I once before stated, I believe
there is not a man in the entire
South better adapted or more capa
ble of managing the matter than Tom
Watson, and I only wish he could
be induced to drop national politics
and devote himself to purely South
ern interests.
I see his friends want Mr. Watson
to “call a convention” of “all re
formers.” Mr. Watson, don’t do it.
You are almost the one and only
man to organize a Southern party,
and now is the time to do it. Make
the first and strongest plank in your
platform “American Suffrage for
White Men Only”—demand the re
peal of the fifteenth amendment. Mr.
Taft says it will never be done, but
even he is not “all wise.” Twenty
years from now, when every buck
nigger can read, write and quote
Yankee history, what purely white
people left in the country will thank
you, even if some do cuss you now,
for as sure as the present party re
mains in power, so sure will the ex
clusion laws be done away with and
the country is to be flooded with, not
thousands but hundreds of thou
sands, of the colored races of the
Orient. The powers that be delib
erately lie about the number now ar
riving, and that number is insignifi
cant, indeed, to the hordes of Chi
nese, Japanese and Indians waiting
for the rush when the gates are open
ed. Think of the millions of Mexi
cans, a mongrel race, that never has
been controlled except by one man,
and he will soon pass away, with no
prospects of a successor capable of
control. Those millions of mongrels
will comparatively soon mix with the
hordes of the Orient, and then the
millions of negroes of the South, ever
ready to mix with anything, to say
nothing of the many Indians and
renegades whites who favor and en
courage amalgamation, as many,
many preachers and newspapers of
the North and the Northwest do,
with laws against it in but a few
states —those of the South.
What kind of a conglomerated pop
ulation will inhabit this country in a
few generations? It looks to me like
in another hundred years most Amer
icans will be mongrels.
We are yet proud of the pure blood
of the South, and should it not be
our wish and duty to protect and per
petuate that purity?
‘Gfye Jeffersonian
Can’t Mr. Watson believe by or
ganizing a Southern party, or white
party, if that will scare some of our
Southern money bags less? He would
soon hold the balance of power po
litically and be of more service to the
people of the South and to the white
people of America than by organiz
ing a National party composed of all
so-called reformers, including the So
cialists, whose mouth-piece the Chi
cago Daily Socialist declares: “No
branch of the Socialist party in the
United States or in any other coun
try refuses to admit negroes and
Chinamen to a real equality.” That
“there are large numbers of negroes
already in the party. Some are or
ganizers and officers. They have
been sent to the national convention
of the party,” etc., and emphasizes in
black caps the assertion: “The So
cialist party is today the only party
that is insisting upon justice to the
negro and is helping him in his fight
for suffrage,” etc.
Helping the negro where? It must
be in the South. Do we want to join
with that kind of a reform party?
Not much. What we do want is a
Southern party, hold our own conven
tions and make use of our balance of
power. Say to the old Republican
party and to the Demorcrat-Republi
can party: adopt our principles and
you can adopt us and our vote—re
fuse and we will bust your old party
—we can do it.
With the hope of yet seeing Tom
Watson at the head of a Southern
party with a department for answer
ing false teachings and the dissemi
nation of Southern truths, that will
soon hold the balance of power, po
litically, I am, Very truly,
E. T. BASYE.

WHY WAS THE PRESS SILENT
ABOUT THE ITALIAN
APPROPRIATION ?
My Dear Friend:—A cousin, Mrs.
Martha Derr, R. F. D. No. 7, Tiffin,
Ohio, was with us a few days since.
I read to her some of your editorials
in the weekly Jeffersonian. She be
came interested and pleased, espe
cially with your views on the ques
tion of “Foreign Missions,” and ex
pressed a desire to read more from
your pen. Find herewith her $1 for
a year’s subscription to the weekly
Jeffersonian to her address as above.
I need scarcely to assure you that I
endorse your position on this ques
tion, as I. do most heartily on the
folly, injustice and unconstitutional
ity of taxing the homeless American
fathers and mothers to send 3,000
ready-made houses to foreigners.
Where is the American press that
boasted “Palladium of Liberty” that
it does not cry out against this vi
cious usurpation of authority? Has
a confidential understanding be
tween Washington and Rome any
thing to do with it? God knows, and
the taxpayers of our country ought
to know. Whither are we drifting,
anyhow? When SBOO,OOO is donated
to foreigners without warrant of law
or justice, and the press with one
noble exception is silent. Where is
the great orator and “Commoner”
of “The Platte” on this question?
Does he fear to speak out as he does
on the question of Bank Control of
the “Life Blood of Commerce”—
Money? God pity a people which
depends on such watchmen to guard
its liberties’ Now with one of those
“Watson pocket knives to show” the
“Old man,” will take pleasure in
showing it and telling of the excel
lence of the Jeffersonians.
With abiding confidence and grow
ing esteem, I am,
Sincerely thine,
JOHN SEITZ.

TELLS HER EXPERIENCE AT THE
SANATARIUM.
Dear Sir:—l am not a subscriber
to the Jeffersonians, but by chance I
have read a sketch of the cruelty that
was imposed on George Bell during
his stay at the Georgia State Sana
tarium at Milledgeville, and as I have
just undergone such cruel treatment
there, and for no cause, I wish to say
that everything he says is true.
I have been to the Sanitarium
twice. The first time I was there
they treated me fairly well, and the
last time I went of my own volition.
My health was so bad before I went
back the second time that I thought
I was incurable, and I became so de
spondent that I implored Mr. Beck
to send me back. This he opposed
because he abhorred the name of an
insane asylum. However, after
much persuasion, I gained his con
sent and went there the first of July.
Fortune favored me, and I began to
improve rapidly and was perfectly
well in a short time, though this was
not due to the medical treatment, for
I had had the special attention of the
leading physicians of our town, and
had been to Atlanta and consulted a
number of specialists. The first three
months I was there I was treated
considerately. Mr. Beck came after
me in November, when I was perfect
ly well, but the Superintendent would
not hear of my leaving without a per
mit from the Ordinary, and Mr. Beck
left with the understanding that he
would return in a few days with the
papers required to secure my release.
Immediately after my husband’s de
parture, I was locked in an empty
room, without even a chair to sit
upon, in my night clothes only, and
all communication between Mr. Beck
and me was stopped, and he was told
the worst kind of tales about me. I
have the letters to him which will
prove this. I was kept up this way
for three months and had no word
from my husband or little girl, and I
had every imaginable notion concern
ing them, fearing that either one, or
both, was dead and that my people
were keeping it from me, thinking
that I might not be able to survive a
sorrowful blow.
No such treatment as this ought to
be allowed. I see nothing right in
the officials being allowed to destroy
the inmates’ private mail, as well as
to read the mail that goes out from
the inmates before it is sent to the
postoffice.
I have not said anything about the
treatment that is meted out to some
of the poor unfortunate inmates of
this place. Without over-estimating
myself, I think I might say that I
