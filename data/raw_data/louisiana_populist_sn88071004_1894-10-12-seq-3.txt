and yet the roads are not worked.
We are glad this road question is
assuming a prominent place in pub

thing that serves as an index to the
public spirit of a country good
roads certainly are one. We hope
this question will not rest here.

band, seven children, a brother and
two sisters, as well as a host of
friends to mourn her loss, to whom
we extend the sympathies of tihe

on this market, anud they will not a& c:pt
the Imitatious when taevy can help thran,

My experience with the use and sale of
Dr richenor's Antiseptic has been indeed
batisat'ct.ory. I can str'ngly eulortse it
uIs a good uedicine.
tV. O. HItRRISON.
I have been using Dr. richenor's An.

GEO. L. ETHRIDGE, P. M.
For cuts, burns, bruises, etc.. there is
nothihg better than Dr. a'ichouor'a An

Dr. Tichenor's Antiseptic is so well and
favorably known throughout this section
that it hardly needs any recommendation.
I always carry it in stock and find it the
best seller I handle in that line.
J, W. DYSON,
I have handled Dr. fichenor's Antisel
tit for seeeral years, and found it decid.
edly the beat seller of its kinl I ever
saw. 1 have also handled the isnitations
but the large majority of my trade pro
ferred Dr. I ichenor's.
B. A. FORTSON.
ST. MAI:RICE, La., June 9, 1894.
I can strongly recommend Dr. Tiche
