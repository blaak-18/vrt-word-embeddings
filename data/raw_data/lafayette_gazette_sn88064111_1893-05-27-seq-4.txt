"German

I mustsay a word as to the ef
ficacy of German Syrup. I have
used it in my family for Bronchitis,
the result of Colds, with most ex
cellent success. I have taken it my
self for Throat Troubles, and have
derived good results therefrom. I
therefore recommend it to my neigh
bors as an excellent remedy in such
cases. James T. Durette, Earlys

Mr. Mivart, the great naturalist, in
an article in the Cosmopolitan Maga- o

his island, after, she had concealed her rie
nest by covering, was able to return to be
it very directly; but if it were uncov- w
ered for her by some one else, she was
not able to recognize it at all. She a
seemed to have no conception of it by
sight. Apropos of this, a subsequent
observation on our common mud wasp
may not be uninteresting.

closed. Behind these I heard the in

dustrious hum of one of these creatures, pc
and on opening the left leaf I exposed T]
her to a strong light, which did not s
seem to disconcert her. In a few min- gi
utes she flew away for a new mud ball. tI
nut 4 her return, although her nest i
was stuck against the red sash, in a
strong contrast, in plain sight, she ci
seemed unable to recognize it. She had
been approaching it at a point where hi
the movable slats were tilted downward d,
(when closed); but of course, now that
the blind was open, these all inclined 1
upward. On the pther leaf, however, at
though much lower down, were some a
slats tilted much as the others had been, b4
and through these she made repeated tl
entrances, only to crawl out into the ii
open light some distance from her nest, at
though she always started in the same rn
relative direction that it lay from the as
other slats when in place. She was evi- w
dently much confused and distressed. qi
She would fly out a little further each bi
time, seeming to think that she had not D
made the right approach, sometimes bi
going out from under the porch and re- p,
turning. At last she dropped her pellet fl
and began a crawling investigation, ri
passing often within a few inches of the it
unfinished cell, but appearing to have p.
never seen it. After much of this she p
went away and came no more that even- al
ing, for it was getting dark.
I failed to think of the incident for a c;
few days, and some one closed the blind
in the meantime, so that when I again tl
examined it the single cell was com- d,
pleted and sealed. On breaking it open o
I found within a small greenish-white al
spider, on the side of which was glued o
the single egg. I send you a shadow b
photograph showing, in exact size, the
relative positiofs. Of course, most of n
your readers know that it was the re
mother's provision for the young larva C
when it should hatch out. I might add co
that the spider showed the usual signs ii
of life in a cataleptic state, showing the ti
wonderful instinct that enabled the o
wasp to sting it at just the right point b
and to the proper extent to allow life p
enough to' remain to preserve it for
food, while it was dead to all efforts at
resistance or escape. Mr. Mivart
stresses this contrast between the want r
of intelligence, in being unable to ap
proach its nest by any route but one g
(and exhibiting such a small amount of s
reasoning wower), and the instinct that "
makes it so skillful in its providence a
and foresight. To his mind it argues a
wide breach between intelligence and
instinct.--James Newton Baskett, in F

Who New selea
The favor with whobhthe new bread,
msade with Royal Baking Powder in- O.
stead of yeast, has been received by
our best housekeepers and most expert
breadmakers, is really wonderful. "It 1
saves all the hard and tedious work of or
knaading and moulding," writes one. C
"Less than an hour from the dry flour an
to the most perfect loaf of bread I ever ml
paw," writes another. "Fresh bread th
every day," says another, "and that a
the lightest, finest and most whole- m'
some, is something to live for." "We rit
relish the bread better than the old F
kind;" "it is ahead of any yeast to
bread I ever baked;" "the bread was st'
whiter and softer." "Best of all,"
writes an enthusiastic housewife;. "we hs
can eat the Royal unfermented bread it
when freshly baked, or even when to
warm, with perfect impunity. It is as
actually an anti-dyspeptic." bi
"This bread has a 'nutty' taste, that on
is peculiarly pleasing," writes still an- tl
other. This is owing to the fact that it
the active gas-producing principle of cc
the Royal is derived from the pure in
grape acid.
The great value of this bread arises to
from the fact that in it are preserved bi
all the most nutritive elements of the to
flour, some of which are decomposed a
and destroyed by the action of yeast. ei
The loss of these properties is what i
makes fresh yeast bread unwholesome. "
The use of the Royal Baking Powder q'
instead of yeast is found to make a h
finer, lighter bread, devoid of all dys- vI
peptic qualities. The same gas-car- o
bonic--is produced as waere yeast is
used, but it is evolved from the baking
powder itself and not from the flour. ii
Thereby the bread is made more whole
some and actually anti-dyspeptic. The
greater convenience where a batch of p
the finest bread can be made and baked ii
in less than an hour with no danger of p
a sour or heavy loaf, must be appre- p
ciated by everyone. h
The receipt for making this bread is t'
herewith given, and housekeepers will t
do well to cut it out and preserve it. a
To make one loaf: One quart flour, s'
1 teaspoonful salt, half a teaspoonful fi
sugar, 2 heaping teaspoonfuls Royal
Baking Powder, half medium-sized cold
boiled potato, and water. Sift together
thoroughly flour, salt, sugar, and bak
ing powder; rub in the potato; add
sufficient water to mix smoothly and
rapidly into a stiff batter, about as soft
as for pound cake; about a pint of
water to a quart of flour will be re
quired-more or less according to the
brand and quality of the flour used.
Do not make a stiff dough, like yeast
bread. Pour the batter into a greased
pan, 434x8 inches, and 4 inches deep,
filling about half full. The loaf will
rise to fill the pan when baked. Bake
in very hot oven 45 minutes, placing
paper over first 15 minutes baking, to
prevent crusting too soon on top. Bake t
at once. Don't mix with milk. I
Perfect success requires the most n
careful observance of all these details. t
The author of the receipt emphasizes c
the statement that Royal Baking Pow- I
der only can be used because it is the
only powder in which the ingredients
are prepared so as to give that continu
ous action necessary to raise the larger i
bread loaf.
To every reader who will write the
result of her bread making from this
receipt to the Royal Baking Powder 1
Co., 106 Wall street, New York, that
company announce that they will send
in return, free, a copy of a most prac- d
tical and useful cook book, containing '
one thousand receipts for all kinds of I
baking, cooking, etc. Mention this
paper.
-All the telephone, girls at Decatur,
IIl, suddenly went on strike one day i
recently, and walked from the office in i
the afternoon, leaving the bells a-jin- 1
gling and subscribers hallooing into
space. They wanted an increase in
wages of from fifteen to twenty dollars
a month. The request was refused, 1
and the manager and superintendent I
had to turn in personally to take their
places, and try to placate the wrathful
public. They had a harrowing- time,
and the service was crippled for a day
or two until new help could be secured.
-The late Samuel E. Adams, of
Richmond, Ind., was fond of telling of
a remarkable coincidence which hap
pened several years ago. During a
severe thunderstorm a canary bird flew
into the house. Within a few minutes
a shivering and badly frightened span
iel was found begging for admission.
The dog was let in. Less than an hour
afterward a child was heard crying on
the outside and the door was opened to
admit a little tot scarcely two years
old. The child, dog and canary were
never claimed. Mr. Adams found a
comfortable home for the little one,
while he continued to care for the dog
and bird.
-The United States navy was almost
annihilated at the close of the revolu
txonar.y war. Of the thirteen frigates
ordered to be built by congress in 1775,.
two had been destroyed on the Hudson
river and three on the Delaware with
out getting to sea. The remaining
eight, together with most of the pur
chased vessels, had been captured by
the British, some at Charleston, some
at Penobscot, and others on the high
seas. The only American ship of the
line ordered by congress and finished,
the Alliance, vwaos presented in 1782 to
the king of France, to supply the place
of a smaller vessel lost in Boston har
bor by an accident.
e -Said a woman recently: "I spent
Sseveral days a short time ago in a little
d towvn in New Jersey not many miles
e from New York. It is just off from the
k railroad, to a station of which, how
ever, a stage goes every day, and it is
very near a large summer hotel, filled
n during the season with boarders. Yet
e in that town I could not buy a single
, New York paper, Sunday or daily, nor
e could I learn of any being taken. I
d found one man who took a weekly edi
r tion of one of the papers, and he stood
Sout as very different from his neigh
d bor. 'But how,' I asked, 'do you know
e what is going on in the world?' and the
h answer I got was, 'We don't care.'"
S -Some fortunate persons have seen
Soccasionally in midsummer a reallyper
r feet mirege on the Delaware coast, be
* tween the breakwater and a little
watering place called Rehoboth, five or
six miles below. Shortly after leaving
Rehoboth by land one seems to see,
Sthree or four hundred yards inland from
the beach, a glassy sea reflecting in its
still waters the hotels at Rehoboth, the
trees to the north beyond and the spires
of Lewes, five miles away. So perfect
is the illusion that persons who know
Sthe place can scarce believe the evi
Sdence of their eyes, as the shore of the
sea appears to be only a few hundred
feet away. It slowly melts at one's
he approacbh, however, until only clear
‚Ä¢ puddles appear in the hollows, and
S-these; too vanish as one drnwvs nlarer.

id Proceeding westward from the Irish
- coast the ocean bed deepens very grad
nally; in fact for the first 230 miles the
of gradient is but 0 feet to the mile. In the
is next 20 miles, however, the fall is over
9,000 feet, and so precipitous is the sud- 1
den descent that in many places depths
r, of 1.200 to 1.600 fathoms arc encoun
Y tered in very close proximity to the 100
n fathom line. With the depth of 1,800
-, to 2,000 fathoms the sea bed in this part 1
to of the Atlantic becomes a slightly un
in dulating plain, whose gradients are so
rs light that they show but little altera
d, tion of depth for 1.200 miles. The ex
at traordinary flatness of these submarine
ir prairies renders the familiar simile of
ul the basin rather inappropriate. The"
e, hollow of the Atlantic is not strictly a
ty basin, whose depth increases regularly
d toward the center; it is rather a saucer
of or dish-like one, so even is the contour
of of its bed.
p- The greatest depth in the Atlantic has
a been found some 100 miles to the
w northward of the island of St. Thomas,
es where soundings of 3.875 fathoms were
n- obtained. The seas round Great Britain
n. can hardly be regarded as forming part
ur of the Atlantic hollow. They are
)n rather a part of the platform banks of
to the European continent which the
rs ocean has overflowed. An elevation of
re the sea bed 100 fathoms would suffice to
a lay bare the greatest part of the North
le, sea and join England to Denmarlk, Ilol
og land, Belgium and France. A deep
channel of water would run down the
st west coast of Norway, and with this
- the majority of the fiords would be con
es nected. A great part of the Bay of
i, Biscay would disappear: but Spain and
on Portugal are but little removed from
h- the Atlantic depression. The 100 fathom
og line approaches very near the west
ir- coast, and soundlings of 1,000 fathoms
by can be made within 20 mniles of Cape St.
ne Vincent, and much greater depths have
gh been sounded at distances but little
he greater than this from the western
d, shores of the Iberian peninsula.-Nau

' that I tell then o sell-afd of course
, I tell them to sell the goods on which I
make the most money. If they
can't do it, I won't have them.
That's whit I hire them for."
This is an actual fact related
/ by a grocer to our salesman
-and it's a common fact;
we have it daily. So, you
see, when they tell you that
some worthless or dangerous
washing-powder--is "' the same
as" or "as gp¬¢l as" Pearline,
that's because it pays a larger profit. Too largc, altogether,
if clerks can be hired on purpose to make peppletake things
they don't want and know nothing of, instead qa tried and
proved article like Pearline. If your grocer s ds you what
you do not order, be honest-send it back. - an
