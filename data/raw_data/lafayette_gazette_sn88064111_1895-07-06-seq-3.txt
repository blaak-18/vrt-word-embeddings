The Fourth of July celebration in
afayette,- was a success despite the
clement weather, an-i it is no ex
people as well as the guests were
pleased with the way the day's pro
gram was carried out. Celebrating
the Fourth was a new thing in Lafa
yette, hence the many expressions
of surprise at the success which has
crowned the efforts of some of our
public-spirited citizens. To the
committee on grounds, headed by
Dr. Felix E. Girard, are due the
thanks of the community for their
prompt and intelligent co-operation
toward making the celebration what
it was-a signal success. With
only a couple of weeks in which to
work, and handicapped by the daily
rains, they succeeded in construct
ing a park, with a stand, grounds
and a track, that would do credit
to any town.
Early in the morning hundreds of
people began to afri ein town un
til our streets were well nigh filled
with visitors who 'soon wended their
way to Falkis Opera House, where
speeches . ere-. to be. made, after
which the Ai bii talked-of baby show
was to take pliae.. 'e opera
house was cro to it utmost
capacity there -tig o .standing
room. In the- ^qdi could be
seen an unusually large number of
babies, who behaved well at first;
but later the confoundedly sweet
little things grew impatient and gave
the old bachelors present an object
lesson of the dark side of married
life.
At ro o'clock Mr. Chas. O. Mou
ton, president of the Business Men's
Association under whose auspices
the celebration was undertaken and
carried to successful conclusion,
addressed the vast audience in be
half of that organization. He spoke
briefly and to the point and closed
his address by introducing the ora
tor of the day, Judge Conrad De
baillon, whose appearance was greet
ed with applause of a most pronoun=
ed description. The judge spoke
with a strong, clear voice, and it.is
well that he did, as he had a full
accompaniment from the dozen ill
natured babies who seemed to take
special delight in making all the
noise they could. Judge Debsillon's
address was not of the spread-eagle
kind; it was' patriotic, thoughtful
and concise and was couched in
pure, strong English. It was re
ceived Iwith marked attention.
At the conclusion of Judge De
baillon's address, Mlr. Win. Camp
bell announced that the baby show
would take place immediately. The
stage was soon crowded with proud
parents and their petted offsprings.
Messrs. W. B. Torian, Omer Mar
tin and Will Webb were requested
to serve as judges. They kindly
consented and at once entered upon
the performance of their onerous
duties. After weighing the claims
of all claimants thoroughly and
conscientiously, they decided to
award the medals as follows:
One day to 6 months-Nora
(Cotter, prettiest; Eddie Lacour,
finest.
Six months to r year-Corinne
Voorhies, prettiest; Ruth Couvil
Ion, finest.
One to 2 years-Berthumrn Cayard,
prettiest; Alphe Broussard, finest.
Two to 3 years-Frank Debail
Ion, prettiest; Beverly Earl Clark,
finest.
That the baby show was a suc
cess is putting it mildly. Among
the competitors for the prizes there
were babies from different parts of
the parish, and some hailed from
other parishes-one little fellow,
who.canxe from a distant point in
the Lone Star State, was brought to
the hall a few minutes too late to be
entered in the "show," but- his
grandfather assured The Gazette
that he would have captured the
first prize beyond doubt; the idea of
his inability to do so was preposter

It is really amusing to see how
deeply concerned the average poli
tician is about the people's welfare.
As each election rolls around he is
put to his wits end to invent some
scheme, or present some so-called
vital interest, regarding which he
expects the people to entertain the
same opinion as himself. Occasion
ally it is the tariff, sometimes the
negro question, now it is the money
question. It is always something.
If the people ever expect relief
through such channels, then they
will be a sadly "left" set. A shoe
maker would certainly not consult
a law} er as to how he should work
his leather; and there is less reason
why the commercial and agricul
tural classes should permit a lot of
politicians to run the country, the
real interests of which they are as
ignorant as "Adam's off ox." Any
man with common sense should be
able to form an opinion of any ques
tion, no matter how complicated or
complex, it may appear, and not
permit any man or set of men to
dictate to him, what that opinion
should be. There are two sides to
every question, and both should be
studied or heard, before a conclu
sion is drawn.

BAY ST. Louis, Miss., JUNE 25, z89;.
In reckoning the annual celebrations of
this institution for the past few years, none
in my memory seem to surpass in laughter
as well as in solemnity this year's. This day
will linger long in many glad hearts. The
programme opened with an overture march
by the brass band and a serenade by the
far-famed orchestra.
When the curtain first rose we beheld a
stage n~;gnificently decorated, and in the
middle of it a table with eatables and a bot
tle of wine. This apparatus well became the
piece that followed "tDans I'Elmbrras,"
one of the most renowned French selections,
specially chosen for the occasion. The
principal character in this are "Plumet"
"â€¢ocrisse," "ScOcctte" and "Griflard."
The next piece was entitled "So Near and I
yet so Far." It is an operatta and is very I
comical. The principal characters in this
are "Sponge." a hungry man, "ioulor, ,"
.11r. Dalton," "'.Mr. L)urich," ".1rs.
Measureton."
While oil cars were attentively catching
tile last notes of the orchestra all cyes were
dazzled to behold thle beautifully decorated
stage re1rcesentiig the Alps in Switzerlanl
for the play of "\Vm. Tell." Tell and
his little son, Albert, appeared in the moun
tains, leading a Ioor blind maln. Another
interesting scene is where Tell shioots an ap
ple off the head of his son at the distance of
a hundred p.ces. In the end Tell coln

To The Lafayette Gaaettle.
This is truely a land of plenty. Such a
crop of corn I believe we never had bef.Are.
Cotton, rice, peas, potatoe.; and sugar-cane
promise a fine yield, while fruit, vegetables,
fat beef, mutton, hogs, and all the neces:sa
ries of life we have iin abuntdance. So when
you visit us again you will n, t have to bring
anything to eat as you did bIefore.
The pear crop in my orchard is heavy,
especially the Keifer pear tree. are very full.
L.ecomptes do not bear so well but ripen
much better; about the tenth of Autl;st they
should be gathered carefully and will in a
few days after ripen ldeliciously. Thl'
Keifer is intended to can and are fine when
properly put up.
The second ward will have ten thousand
barrels of corn to sell if no storms interfere.
Since cotton and rice went so low it has
learned us to raise our own hog and hominy
and will tend hercatter to make better
farmers of us; make us raise all our hornme
supplies and as well we will raise less to sell,
and have less to buy.
With our rich productive soil we should
earth. I have traveled extensively, but I
never saw land produce so, much riI:h
grass for hay as Lafayette parish, but we
save but very little hay, not half enough for
home use. It was claimed by old stock
raisers that cattle did not thrive if fenced up
in pastures, but ten years' experience proves
quite the contrary with me; my stock in the
last three years have increased a little over
one hundred per cent, while I have been
able to much improve the breed.
Can some one through your valuable
journal tell us how to destroy the briar that
is taking possession of our pastures. I can
cut an acre level with the ground in five
minutes by draging a barbed wire through
them where there are no trees, but they
come up again thicker than ever. Succes
sive cuttings tend to enlarge the patches and
the berries are worthless when raised in the
hot sun. OBERON.

The conference in Memphis of
citizens of the United States who be
lieve that silver should be restored
to the place it occupied in our cur
rency system prior to 1873 was suc
cessful in the highest sense. The at
tendance was actually large, and in
its representative capacity enor
mous. The expectation of those
who brought about the conference
were more than realized. Over
nine-tenth of the delegates were
Democrats, though the predetermi
nation was that the conference
should be non-partisan in its charac
ter. Hence, everybody who chose
to come was admitted, and thus the
conference was Democratic in the
true-sense. There were Republi
can and Populists :n the throng, and
they were accorded consideration,
because all were citizens filled with
patriotic purpose to rescue the coun
try from the financial evils that be
set it. A convention more notable
for its significance was never held
upon the soil of tree American, and

The Necessity For Conscisentlous
Rulers.
[As this valuable contribution to
the Symposium of Oct. 2, was re
ceived too' late for mention then,
we give it place now.]
VW. Jennings Demoresti
The multifarious character and
magnitude of the interests that grow
lout of the demands of a large com
munity for protection from appoint
ed guardians, make the obligations
and .selection of these guardians a
matter of the greatest possible im
portance.
As the highest good and welf'ire
of the people can only be secured
when the wisest, best, and most
conscientious ien are selected to
guard and direct the affairs of a
large community, to put the lives
and properties of the people in the
hands of unscruplous men, especial
ly men whose education, instincts
and interests are associated with the
vilest dens in the community, is to
invite crime, jeopardize every home,
and degrade every department of
the people's interests.
This is too evident to need any
argt*ment; yet we find our country
is, in all its political aspects, now
under the dominion and control of
the liquor dealers, a class of men
whose very business has become a
synonym for the most abject degra
tion, a business that not only de
moralizes the whole people, but has
not one redeeming feature of moral
character; a business that blights
and blasts the whole community
with the mildew of crime, pauptr
ism and debauchery.
What wonder that we have vice
and corruption pervading the whole
field of politics, that chicanery and
plunder in puolic office is the rule,
and not the exception?
Wnat wonder that 8,ooo dens of
vice and crime are legalized in the
city of New York, and in like pro
portion in other cities all o"'er the
land? What wonder that labor ele
ments are everywhere disturbed, that
anarchy, distrust, trainwrecking,
uiurlcrs, and other high crimes are
so prevalent all over the world?
IBut why these terrible scenes in
,o- callc'd civilized communities?
The answer comes back with fear
ful truth: Alcoholic poisoning,
justified by law, is responsible.
iThe whole country is in a state of
unrest, property is jeopardized,
lives endangered, communities
flooded with crime, misery, and
pauperism, and all to gratify a vic
ious, degraded appetite, and in sub
serviency to the most dastardly and
wic:ckd selfishness.
