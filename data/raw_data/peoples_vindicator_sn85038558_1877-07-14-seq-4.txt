"Men of Straw."-The Origin of
the Phrase.
It would seem that the al oe de
signation is not exclusively applina
hie to the particular class of men who
have borne it in morlce mIodernl time'S-
in other- words, that the despicable
class of individuals who, in ages gone
by, have constituted the "men of
straw," equally flourished, andl were
patronized tu the courts of modern
Europe and ancient Greece. We are
assured, indeed, by a clever writer ill
one of the London(l quarterlies (the
number we forget) that, in the courts
of ancient Greece, even;, a class of
men answei ing precisely to the lcd
scription given in our caption was to
be found; and froim the fact (noto
rious as it would seem) that "Athens
abounded in straw shoes," the infer
ence is pretty plain that Ieon'CeicI
witnesses were by no Ileians scarce
amuong tihe highly cultivated citizens
of Athens. The writer % 4ouhl seemlu to
intimate, also, that, as in \'estaini
ster Haltl, formerly, "these 'Mien of
Straw' walked openly in court, with a
straw in one( of their shoes, to signify
they wanted employment as witness
es," so the probability would seem to
be that, while in the Greek courts
dowuright perjury was manifestly
connived at by the judges, so, in
Christianized England, manay years
ago, men could easily be found to
give any evidence upon olath thlat
mlighlt be required--and lhence origi
nated 1the saying, "he is a 1an 1 of
Straw." The custom, however, has
high antiquity, and, as coIInIentled
upon by the writer ill the Quarh'rhl
heriew, assumes an intelest (we htad
almost said a fascination) not easily
to be resisted. We coply his concllid
iIg remarks, verbatiml, leaving to
the reader to infer how lull of novel
and exciting matter thile quarterl
eorlvespondent's conmmuuicatnion luist
Le. "We have all heard of a race of
men" (so the writer concludes his
article) "who used, ill former days,
to ply about our own e,,urts ot
law; and who, from thleir manner of
making known their occupation,
were recognized by the name of straw
sboes. An advocate or lawIyer who
wanted a conrenient witness, knew by
these signs where to find one; and
the colloquy between thile parties was
brief. 'Don't you reniemiber ' said
the advocate-(the party looked at
the fee, and gave no sign; but tilhe
fee increased, and the powers of
memory increased (with it)-' To be
sure 1 do.' 'Then tome into court
and swear it!' and straw shoes went
into court and swore it." Only we
might be supposed to be dealing in
that mean weapon, flattery, we
could mention .he naunes of some of
cities niearer home where straw
lshones could be found as well as in
Athena.

They are worth their

READ WHAT HE SAYS:
DR. TuTr:--Dear Sir: For ten years I have been

piles gone, and I have gained forty pounds solid flesh.
They are worth their weight in gold.

Road the Answer
It is a plant that grows in the South, and is spe.
cially adapted to the cure of diseases of that climate.
It is
NATURE'S OWN REMEDY,
Entering at once into the blood, expelling all scrof
ulous, syphilitic, and rheumatic affections. Alone,
it it a searching alterative, but when combined with
Sarsaparilla, Yellow Dock, and other herbs, it forms
Dr. Tutt's Sarsaparilla
and Queen's Delight,
The most powerful blood purifier known to medical
science for the cure of old ulcers, diseased joints, foul
discharges from the cars and nostrils, abscesses, skin
diseases, dropsy, kid'ney complaint, evil effects of
secret practices, disordered liver and spleen. Its use
strengthens the nervous system, imparts a fair coin
plexion, and builds up the body with
HEALTHY, SOLID FLESH.
As an antidote to syphilitic poison it is strongly
recommended. Hundreds of cases of the worst type
have been radically cured by it. Being purely veg
etable its continued use will do no harm. The best
time to take it is during the summer and fall ; and
instead of debility, headache, fever and ague, you
will enjoy robust health. Sold by all druggists.
