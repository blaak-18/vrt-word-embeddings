SHALL THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY DIE?
There are no elements of surprise
in Mr. Bryan’s iSan Antonio inter
view.
Os course he will take the nomina
tion for President again if he can get
it. What is a fourth defeat to a man
who has already been thrice defeated,
but who has so successfully capital
ized the prestige of his leadership
that it yields him an income of $50,-
000 or $60,000 a year in profits from
his newspaper, his writings and his
lectures? Deprive Mr. Bryan of his
perpetual candidacy for President
and he might say with iShylock:
“You take my life
When you do take the means whereby
I live.”
Much as we may deplore Mr.
Bryan’s selfishness and his cold
blooded disregard of the interests of
his party, the fact remains that if he
is again the Democratic candidate for
President the responsibility will rest
wholly upon the Democratic politi
cians and more particularly upon the
Democratic leaders in the South.
Mr. Roosevelt is boasting that “if I
had been a candidate for President
this time I would have carried Geor
gia and broken the 'Solid South.” As
against Mr. Bryan he undoubtedly
would. With Mr. Bryan again the
Democratic candidate it is likely that
any man the Republicans nominate
can carry Georgia and break the
Solid South. With the Democracy all
but exterminated as a national or
ganization in the North, what would
be left of the party with the Solid
South broken ?
There is only one answer to Mr.
Bryan’s complacent announcement
that “if the Democratic party and
the contingencies demand it I would
again be a candidate.” That answer
is embodied in The World’s question,
“Shall the Democratic party die?” —

AS TO THE FUTURE OF CHINA.
The Associated Press telegram says
there was no moaning at the bar, or
words to that effect, among the Chi
nese when the Emperor of China “put
out to sea.” Neither was there re
joicing, as very properly might have
been had political conditions in the
flowery kingdom been otherwise than
they are. The death of the imbecile
Emeperor, followed immediately by
the death of the senile Dowager Em
press, implies no change of regime for
the better, and in all probability will
give a free hand to the worse ele
ments of Chinese officialdom, so long
held in restraint by the clear head and
firm hand of one of the most remark
able women of this or any other age.
It is yet a remote future when the
yellow peril which haunts the German
Emperor’s imagination will material
ize if China is to be an important
factor in it. As for a constitutional
government for China, it is neither
to be expected nor desired at this
time. —Petersburg Index-Appeal.
PARCELS POST BOUND TO COME.
We cannot see how any man with
fair intelligence can fail to see that
a parcels post must come in time.
There is every fair largument to show
that such a postal service would bene
fit the people. Other nations have it
and our people suffer without it. It
has got to come eventually, and will
come just as soon as the people un
derstand their rights. Those who
fight so to oppose it will get out of
the way and prepare themselves for
the change or get run over. —Win-
chester Star.
JUDGE HINES AND HIS JOB.
'Some papers think Governor Smith
should get rid of James K. Hines as
attorney to the Railroad Com
mission at $2,500 —and simply be
cause Hines voted for Tom Wat
son. We do not think the Gov
ernor should do anything of the
kind. Hines didn’t receive the ap
pointment under false pretenses. He
was the same Hines politically then
that he is now and Governor Smith
knew it. Let us be fair and honest
about political matters as we go
along.—Greensboro Herald-Journal.
OBJECT LESSON.
There was an object lesson last fall
for those who believe that the tariff
protects the American laborer, in the
exodus of foreigners at the beginning
of the panic. As soon as they were
thrown out of employment they pack
ed their grips and sailed across the
Atlantic to their various European
homes. It is authoritatively stated
that they took with them no less than
$100,000,000 in gold. Can the ad
ministration be serious in its solici
tude for the American laborer when it
permits hordes of “cheap” laborers
from Europe who never expect to be
come citizens, who care nothing for
our institutions, and who cannot be
forced to fight under our flag, to come
to our shores in unlimited numbers,
and enter into competition with our
native-born citizens?
The Cincinnati Enquirer says edi
torially :
American employers of labor should
see to it that all those who are now in
America be fully employed before one
man of these transient hordes is given
a pl ace.
“Let our own laboring men, Ameri
can citizens or alien residents alike,
have the preference of employment
in every way over those who desert us
at the first whistle of adverse winds.”
The trouble is that “American
employers of labor” are not doing
business from philanthropic motives;
they are in business for the money
there is in 4 it for themselves, and it is
one of their cardinal business princi
ples to buy their labor just as cheap
as they can, just as they buy their
raw material. So the American la
borer must go into competition, right
in his own dooryard ,with the “pau
per” labor of Europe, while at the
same time he must pay the additional
cost of living which, it is contended,
is the result of the protection to
Jeffersonian
American labor that we hear so much
about. —Woodsfield, Ohio, Sentinel.
HE WENT WRONG, POOR
FELLOW.
He went wrong; what a pity.
Brainy? Yes. Brilliant? Yes.
Endowed with a mind colossal in its
wonderful power; fitted to be a star
in the firmament of civilization; in
the world of letters and literature,
equipped by nature to shine with
resplendent glory, —yes, he possessed
all these, yet he went wrong, poor
fellow.
Born into the world amid scenes of
plenty, a scion of the old South’s
aristocracy; thrown upon the cold
mercies of the world by the devasta
ting calamities of the Civil War at
an early age; reared in the terrific
struggle for foothold in life’s path
way. That is the story of so many
of the 'Southern youths’ downfall.
Snatched from a home of modest
competency to battle with the wolf at
the door. In this school of poverty
he saw millions of his fellow toilers
bowed down by unjust laws, oppress
ed by special privileges to the other
fellow at the expense of his co-work
ers. Dreaming of becoming the leader
of the masses, he gave unselfishly of
his great talent to a line of work that
he hoped would help his fellow toilers
to regain lost liberties—thus it was
that he went wrong. Ah! the pity of
it. Had he chosen to become the
servile tool of the powers that be, his
success would have been so great
no office would have been so high but
what his party would have been de
lighted to honor him with it; no so
ciety so aristocratic but that he would
have been its brightest ornament; no
honors great enough for him. This
was all known to him at first. Then
why did he go wrong?
If he had only stayed in the Demo
cratic party he could have had every
thing in its gift for the asking. They
needed him in the Democratic party.
When special favors were to be
granted to the participants of Demo
cratic pie, what voice could plead
more eloquently for the than
his? When some corporation
wanted a decision handed down
that would protect their interest
what lawyer could array irresist
ible, logical facts clearer before
the court than he? None. Had he
so desired his great talent could have
been given to plutocracy instead of
to the masses and another Pactolus
of gold would have flowed into his
coffers. Riches beyond the dreams of
avarice would have been his. Then
why did he go wrong politically? Oh!
the pity of it. At the first he saw
the two paths. Which would you have
taken ? The one led to untold wealth,
position, wordly honors; the other
to a life of toil, of sacrifice, of misun
derstood zeal, of ridicule and abuse
even on the part of those for whom
he toiled. Elected to office early in
life upon a platform of definite prin
ciples, the caucus dictations of his
party demanded that he repudiate the
platform upon which his constituency
elevated him from the ranks. Others
placed in congress as he was obeyed
the caucus dictation and today are
still recipients of the party’s liber
ality towards traitors.
With him the question fairly pre
sented itself. To go with the others
and stay in the party or be true to
the platform upon which he was
elected and be driven out of the
party. What would you have done?
Would you have gone with Living
ston and others of his ilk, or would
you have gone wrong politically?
Yes, he went wrong, how foolish!
By going wrong he is forever doomed
to go through life with the eternal
enmity of those for whom he toils;
to meet the jeers and hisses of the
people above all others that he loves.
Never, while he lives, is the to know
that his battle has not been fought in
vain. Not until his eyelids are kissed
down in the last eternal sleep by the
faithful and loving few, will the peo
ple awake to the injustice of it all,
the awful inhumanity of it all.
Not until it is too late for him to
enjoy, will the just tribute be paid.
Not until he can no longer disturb
existing conditions; expose the graft
and greed of robber thieves, will one
and all bend their pilgrim feet to the
mound where his ashes rest, and on it
drop a rose and a tear for one of
the nation’s greatest souls.
Then, the bitter strife will have
been forgotten. The unselfishness of
his life’s work will be apparent.
Those who now condemn will be the
loudest in thetir praise. Then the
busy brain will have ceased to think;
the busy hands will be folded and the
busy life at rest. Then, too, will the
intelligence of the world bow at the
shrine of his bier; the toiling mil
lions weep bitter tears of regret, not
because he went wrong, but that in
going wrong he went right, and they
refused to see it; refused to try to
learn it!
Yes! He went wrong, politically,
but in doing so was right. Ah! the
pity of it! The awful cruelty, the in
humanity of it all! —Royston Record.
H. Clay Pierce, president of the
Waters-Pierce Oil Co., and under in
dictment, at Austin for false swearing
in connection with the re-admission
of that company to do business in
Texas, came to Austin Monday and
gave bond in the sum of $20,000 for
his appearence in January for trial.
The country awaits with interest the
next subterfuge to keep this wealthy
malefactor from behind prison bars.

Guess Tammany got her money’s
worth. The Democratic Governor
was given 60,000 —Mr. Taft got the
rest. Tammany plays politics for
keeps, and such organization is a real
disgrace to any party. —Talladega

That South Alabama Cuba tobacco
is said to beat the real stuff. The
Democrats of Brewton scratched the
name of W. J. Bryan off of a box of
cigars made of it, and sent them to
Taft. It may be a little mean, but
Taft is swiping lots of Bryan’s pres
ents! —Talladega (Ala.) Reporter.
