Emergeneies like these bring men to the
rout and Captain Foster was a product of
that era.
He and the MuanY ;ethers associated in
the movement for the restoration of the
government of the State to the hands of
her own people, the intelligest and prop
erty holding classes, wrought well their
part, for to 1877, after nine years of carpet
bag despottsm and corruption, the liemc
oracy triumphed. Nicholls became gov.
ornor, a new oenstitution otllowed, and
again did Louisians, regenerates', assume
her rightful place in the sisterbood of
Sta'ce.
He was a conspicuous uitre in every
Democratic corventior; his judment w.s
s'iu1ht and his counsel carried grea
weigot. He had much to ssy as to the
men who should be chosen toiht limporiant
stations. but so'.ght not office for himneelf.
Thus, for more than a quarter of a' c'i
titry he was..a power in the State. Hi
