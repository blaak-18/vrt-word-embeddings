WATSON IN ATHENS.
On Wednesday, September 16, Hon.
Thomas E. Watson, candidate for
president of the United States on
the People’s party platform, deliv
ered a most able and convincing ad
dress before a audience in the
court house. The hall was packed
to its utmost capacity and many
were turned away on account of there
not being sufficient space in the
building.
Many prominent ladies from this
and adjacent counties were present
to hear the distinguished Georgian.
A large portion of the audience
■were Democrats, many of whom were
interested and deeply impressed with
the eloquence, the powerful and con
vincing arguments used by the
speaker.
Promptly at ten o’clock Mr. Wat
son began his speech. He first ex
plained to the members of his party
his attitude in regard to the renom
ination of Hoke Smith, as it had been
reported to him that they were not
pleased With it.
He spoke at length upon the cam
paign of 1906, the agreement between
Hardwick, Hoke Smith and himself,
and the pledges Hoke Smith had
made, which, after he became gov
ernor, he failed to carry out. He
Xsl)e 3fcffersortiaii
said the first thing Hoke Smith’s
paper, the Atlanta Journal, publish
ed editorially was that Hoke would
have been elected without the aid of
himself and the Populist party, which
was ingratitude of the grossest na
ture.
He scored Hoke, and justly, for
the part he took in to
take from the country counties their
|tower, and to concentrate it in thh
cities. He explained the danger Slid
debased methods which would be the
result.
The next point he took was in ref
erence to Bryan and Kern. On the
whiskey question he said Kern’s rec
ord smelled like an empty beer-keg,
and Bryan’s like a full Christmas
jug. Ho said Bryan had never voted
the prohibition ticket, but had voted
for open saloons and that Kern was
the attorney for a big brewery. He
declared that Bryan was catering to
the negro vote; that he had given
the negro delegation satisfaction
which they didn’t get from. Taft, and
that delegation left Bryan with shouts
for the “Peerless,” and were now
sending circular letters through the
Southern States in his behalf, which
were malicious and an outrage, and
no newspaper had referred to them;
no effort had-been made to .suppress
them. He produced one of the orig
inal letters. He asserted that in
1896 he and Bryan were darned on
the same ticket, had stood for the
same principles, and since then Bryan
had shifted his position several times,
and that he still stood on the plat
form which every Democrat in the
South said was good democracy
eighteen years ago.
He reiterated the charges made by
Alfred Henry Lewis that Bryan
threw awav his vote in the Demo
cratic caucus because he said he
could not afford to vote for Crisp
on the grounds that Crisp was an
ex-Confederate soldier.
The meeting was a notable occa
sion, and a victory for the Populist
cause.
Spain has announced that she will
act in unison with France in the

A. IL S. Moore, R. F. D. No. 1,
Brooks, Ga.:
“I write to say that I am glad that
in you we have one statesman who
stands on just principles for the
masses and not the classes. I am in
the ring to stay until our party passes
away, and if it should, I will quit
voting, for there is no relief in the
two old parties.”

R. M. Brown, Lake Butler, Fla.:
“W. J. B.’s attempt to entice the
negro vote has lost many a white
vote for him in the South. ” ✓
The more pleasing and pleasant our
government can make farm life the
better it is for the government. Our
cities are overcrowded with worthless
lotafers that might be honorable and
respectable farmers. The rural route
is one of the things that has been
provided to make farm life more
desirable and attractive, and as we
all have to live off the farmers noth
ing should be left undone that could
be done to make the farm inviting.—

Among th® ingenuities of im
