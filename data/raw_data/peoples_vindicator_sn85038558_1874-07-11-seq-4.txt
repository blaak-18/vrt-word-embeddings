Cherry Pectoral,
For Diseases of the Throiat and Lungs,
.euch as Coughs, Colds, Whooping.
Cough, Bronchitis, Asthma,
and Consumption.
Among the! great
discoveries of mnl
ern science. fiw are'
jof more real value
to mamnkind thian
" /this eflcttu:d cem
'elv for all diseases
of'the Throat and
Lungs. A vast tri
il of its virtues,
throughout this andl
other countries, has
shown that it does
' surely andi effectunlly control them. The tes
r timony, of our best ciiens, of all cltasses, es
1 tablislies the fact, that CIIi.ltY PCltrorAL
will and does relieve and cure the atllicting
disorders of the Throat and Lungs beyond any
other medicine. Th'le most (dagerous .flb+e
tions of the l'ulmona:ry Organs yield to its
power; and c:ecs of Consumption, cured
by this preparation, are publiclv kinown, so
t remarkable as hardly to he believed, .'ere
they not proven beyond dispute. As a renm
e edy it is adequate, on which the public may
a rely fir full protection. By curing Cotughs,
the forerunners of :lore serious disease, it
saves unummIbere!' lives, and an amuontt of
sntli'ring not to be computed. It challenges
trial, and convinces the most sceptical.
Every tLunily should kep it on hand as a
protection against the early and unperceived
attacks of l'mnlmonarv Afiections, which are
easily met at first, but which become incula
i ble, and too often fatal, if neglected. Tender
lungs need this defence; and it is unwise to
be without it. As a safeguard to children,
amid the distressing di.c.ices which beset the
l'ihroat ;nd hllest of childhood, CHERRun
I'Ec'ronA is invaluhable; for, by its timely
use, multitudes are rescued from premature
graves, and savel to the love and affection
centred on them. It acts speedily and surely
against ordinary colds, securing soulnd andil
health-restoring sleep. No one will suffer
troublesome Influeuza ::al painfil DBron
chitis, when they know how easily they can
be cured.
Originally the product of long, laborious,
and successful chemical investigation, no cost
or toil is spared in making every bottle in the
1 utmost possible perfection. It nmay be confi
1 dently relied upon as possessessing nil the vir
tues it has ever exhibited, and capable of
producing cures as memorable as the greatest
SIt has ever etlbeted..

ENEWER.
Every year increases the polulari.
ty of this valuable Hair Preparation;
r which is due to merit alone. We
r can assure our old patrons that it is
t kept fully up to its high standard;
o and it is the only reliable and perfect
ed preparation for restoring GRat
o FADED HAIR to its youthful color,
making it soft, lustrous, and silken.
The scalp, by its use, becomes white
e and clean. It removes all eruptions
and dandruff, and, by its tonic prop
erties, prevents the hair from falling
out, as it stimulates and nourishes
e the hair-glands. By its use, the hair
grows thicker and stronger.w In
baldness, it restores the capillary
glands to their normal vigor, and
will create a new growth, except in
extreme old age. It is the most eco
c nomical HAIr DPRESSING ever used,
as it requires fewer applications,
and gives the hair a splendid, glossy
a appearance. A. A. Hayes, I.D.,
State Assayer of Massachusetts, says,
"The constituents are pure, and care
filly selected for excellent yuality;
and I consider it the BEST YREPA
,aTIoN for its intended purposes."
