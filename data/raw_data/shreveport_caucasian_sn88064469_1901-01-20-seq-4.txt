"OLD MAIDS.
Why are old maids like the angels
in heaven ? (uerried a small boy o!
his maiden aunt. Not being honored
with a reply, the young hopeful said:
B causethey neitherna.rrv nor ar
given in marriage.-Boyce (Lf.;. E:
terprise.
Old maid@.' There is associate
with the name of "old maids' a rev
erenee which commands the respec
and esteem of all true men. To
often and thoughtlessly is :the nam
of "old maid" held in derision. Better
be "an old maid'" than the slave or
the servant of a man, who could no'
appreciate the full worth of a noble,
loving woman. Who can tell the
self-sacrifice, the self abuegation cf
"the old maid?" equally as heroic
and sublime . as the va'orous
warrior on the field, mwved
by the ambition of winning fame and
renown. Js it because the "old mail,'
unlike the warror bold, has held in
reserve the secret of her self-sacrifice
that she is less sublime? Let no idle
no frivolous thought be associated
with the name of "Old Maid." If the
records of the courts be a guide,
more than one good woman would be
happier today can old maid,? Bless
the "old maids." Around them and
absout them is a hallo of loye whic e
is relected from Heaveu and in
Haven will be found the "old maidsn
ant becnase they "aeriher married nor
are given in marriage," but because
