ir. NEw ORLEANS COTTON EXCtIN.IGE, d(
lit New Orleans, Sept. 8, 1l77.
Allowance for Side Pieces.
Attention is called to annexed ac- R,
n- tion of the board of directiors of th' of
New Orleans cotton exchange, in re- pt
lation to a resolution adopted at the di
fourth day's sesssion of the national ell
s- cotton exchange convention, fixing an n,
allowance for side pieces in all iAc L,
American markets, viz: St
"Whereas, The national cotton ex- w;
change convention on its fourth day's re
ty session at Greenbrier, White Sulphur Ili
Springs, Va., during July, 1877, pass- pa
ed a resolution to the effect that on w
Jy all bales of cotton with side-pieces, pr
an allowance of three pounds per to
ad lale he umade to the buyer, and Fe
Whereas, There no longer exists el
any legal necessity for the use of
silde pieces on bales of cotton, and pt
, Where(as, Part of the cotton crop is
now marketed with and part withodt
side-pieces, thus making a relative 18
li- difference in weight of bales that
cannot be properly allowed for by the
buyer, tlherefore be it
Rlesolved, That from and after the
st first lday of October, 1877, all bales
of cotton delivered in New Orleans-
the sides of which are covered with Nu
IS strips of bagging denominated "side- pe
3, pieces"-shall be subject to an allow. er
td ance to the buyer of three pounds So
te per bale for each and every bale so de
covered." on
The modification of the law enforc- ev
ing the use of side-pieces, left it op
tional with planters whether their tal
use should be continued. The trade nt
generally here and abroad are oppos
ed to such continuance. It is urged
Ic that with proper handling, cotton can 0
s- be brought froml plantations to mar- an
dl ket in as good condition without as tai
o with side-pieces; and the customary tit
compression in our seaports of the cll
bales for export to other markets,
reduces their size so that side-pieces
are worse than useless, being abso- wi
t lutely in the way. hi
It is the common custom of buyers tr
for export, to make allowance, ii
their calculations of the actual cost of
cotton, for the weight of the bagghing O0
and ties, manufacturers basing their on
contracts for supplying cotton-yarns in
and clothes upon the net price of raw
cotton laid down at their mills.
i The three pounds per bale for side- bi
pieces, have hitherto been allowed w
r for in their calculations asfully as has te
been the weight of the rest of the
d bagging and the iron ties, all of whIich i
o are of no use to them after they cease .
d to be a covering to the cotton. of
Hence, the omission of side-pieces,
for which they have only apparently
t (and not in realhty) been paid in the
sale of their cotton, will be a direct w"
and positive saving to planters. Es- ga
pecially is this the case, as the use
of side-pieces increases the consaump- se
e tion, and consequently, aids in the til
enhancement of the price of bag-ca
gitng.

City Item. tir
The following cards of Major ia A: t
y Burke and his indorser, H. C. Brown,
e we find in the New York Suw of the
fifth instant. It will be seen that
Major Burke confines himself exclu- Pt
sf eively to an explanation of what he
said to the SUN's reporter relative to p
the production of the necessary evi
Sdence to convict the members of the
Returning Board. We must confess,
however, that we do nos see that the a
explanation materially alters the thi
main statement contained in the SUN.
- Whatever is lacking, Ihowever, in the
1- Major's rejoinder is fully contpensa- let
d ted for by the enthusiastic, unre- tlh
:- served and unqualified indorsement i
u of Mr. Brown. That settles it:

STo the Editor of the Sun i
. SIn--Major B. A. Burke, of Niew "
- Orleans, never was a Republican,
k- never held office under Warmothb, and
to was never connected with the plun. g
derers of Louisiana. In 187$ Major t
sh Burke was a candidate of thie Demo. Y4
ri- cratie party for the most iilportant to
of position In New Orleans, and was '
re the most active member of the Mc- st
d- Euery Campaign Comnmittee. lu
Ds 1874 he was elected Aministrator of
k- Improvements of New Orleans, a po- r
an sition combining the duties of the gi
od New York Board of Public Works,
and served until December, 1576. i
The Radical administration of this
office cost the city in 8lll to 187
over three millions; in 187:-74.over
two millions, and in 185 and 1~7t:
under Burke, the expenditures weru
but seven hundred and twenty thou
ualnd dollars, lie showing more workl
d,,w than his predecessors.

A Sporting Editor it d Coilert
[Chicago llerald.]
The musical critic of one t'f the
New York papers having been conm
pelled to leave town suddenly on thed
eve of a concert by the Philharmonid
Society, a confrere on the sporting
department of the journal kindly vol
unteered to takb li!. place for thd
evening. His work, whatevei hiis
shortcomings in an artistic sense, cer
tainly lacked nothing in originality;
and we commend his style to some of
thie i)ancaster critics. Hear him :
Time was called exactly ait eight
o'clock, and about fifty bugles, fifed
and fiddles entered for the contest.
The fiddles won the toss, and took
the inside with chandeliers right iii
their eyes. The umpire, with a small
club, acted as starter. Just before the
start he stood upon a cheese box;
with a small lunch counter before
him, and shook his stick at the en
tries to keep them down.
The contestants first socked it il
Landliche Hochzeit, by Goldstiark,
Op. 36. They got off neatly evens
one of the sorrel fiddles gently lead
ing. The man with the French horn
tried to call them back, but they set
tled down to a sogging gait wtith the
big roan fiddle bringing up the rear:
At the first quarter the little black
whistle broke brdly and, went into
the air, but the fiddles on the left kept
well together, and struck up a rat
tling gait: At the half pole the mad
with the straight horn showed sings
of fatigue. There wits a bob-tailed
flute which wrestled sadly with thd
sorrel bugle at the half mile; bnut lid
was Wind brokefi and wheeted. The
galoot with the big fat bugle kept
calling "whoa" all the time, but hl
seemed to keep up with the rest un
til the end of the race. They all
came under the string in gobi order;
but the judge on the cheese box seem
ed to reserve his opinions He seemed
tired, and the tobitestats Went out
to find their bottle holders, and get
ready for the Beethovan Handicap.
It was a nice exhibition, but a little
tiresome to the observer. All bets
ate off.
