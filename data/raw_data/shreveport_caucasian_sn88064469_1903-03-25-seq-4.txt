Why
Embarrassing.
A settlement worker. i:tl ring been re
quested by anxious mothers to address
the younger women of the settlement
clubs on "heart interest" topics, decid
ed to do so. She talked with the girls
earnestly, urging upon them the deep
and intrinsic sacredness of all love and
marriage relations, the coarseness and
vulgarity of indiscriminate flirtations.
the great and growing need for high
ideals, standards and action on the wo
man's part. Then, just as she took her
seat, it occurred to her that she might
have talked a little bit over the heads
of her listeners, and she sprang to her
feet with an added remark:
"Please believe that what 9 say is
true, my dear friends," she exhorted
earnestly, "and please don't think i
don't understand my subject. I know
what I'm talking about, girls-- really
do."
Once more she took her seat, delight
ed with the air of general interest, and
from the reas of the room came the
question :
"Please, Mrs. S, how many times
have you been in love?"-New Y6rk
Commercial Advertiser.
The Word "*Jolly..
On the adoption of the word "jolly"
into the English it had the meaning of
beautiful, as it has among the French
today. The English dramatist Beau
mont of the sixteenth century speaks
of our first mother as "the jolly Eve."
In time, however, it came to mean hi
larious, regardless of physical beauty.
But this latter meaning is probably
the right one after all, as the word
doubtless comes from Yule (Yu-le). the
pagan Christmas, so to speak, for be it
known that what we now observe as
Christmas day was a heathen holiday
called Yule, and the Yule festival was
one of noisy demonstration.
Yule indeed means noise or outcry,
praising in loud voice, chanting, sing
ing, making outcry in honor of their
god. From yule, then, to jolly the step
is short and easy, both meaning revel
ry, rejoicing. Ours is a risen Lord,
theirs the same. The words are identi
cal. So, too, in large degree the Christ
mas jollities, praises and those of hea
then Yule. Into such close relation do
simple words sometimes connect the
present with the past.
A Chinese Joke.
In his book on "China and the Chi
nese" Dr. Giles gives a specimen of
Chinese humor which, if the source
were not known, might well be mis
taken for American humor.
There is a Chinese story which tells
how a very stingy man took a paltry
sum of money to an artist-payment is
always exacted in advance-and asked
him to paint his portrait. The artist at
once complied with the request, but
when the portrait was finished nothing
was visible save the back of the sit
ter's head.
"What does this mean?" cried the sit
ter indignantly.
"Well," replied the artist, "I thought
a man who paid so little as you paid
wouldn't care to show his face."
Great Natures.
Great natures are always generous.
They are fountains not only of vitality,
but of bestowal. However great the re
wards they receive may be, these re
wards are but a fraction of the worth
of the service rendered, and no man
ought to be satisfied, whatever his po
sition or work, unlesrt e can feel that
he is giving far more than he is re
ceiving, that a very large part of what
he does is not returned in money, that
however successful be may be on the
practical side he must still be counted
one of the benefactors of his kind be
cause of the generosity of his bestow
al.--Outlook.
PeaeC Pits.
The statement has been made that
prossic acid was made from peach
stones. This is altogether a mistake,
for, although under certain conditions
a trace of the main principle of the
deadly poison can be found in peach
stones, there is not sufficient to pro
duce the acid without other essential
lngredients. Indeed, without the proe
ess of fermentation there is no evidence
at all of prussic acid in the stones.-Ex

to the mayor, city attorney and city en
gineer. Said propositions to be present-,
ed to said committee in writing. )Decis
ion of committee to be binding on this
council. Adopted. Several councilmen
stated they favored'the paving of the
street.
Mr. Foster objected to the paving of
Lacy, Jacobs, Winstni and other short
streets in suburban districts, on the
eround that the same was unnecessary,
but was voted down.
Mr. Busbey objected to paving of
Stoner avenue. His objections were re
moved by the following proposition
made by him to the council, which was
-tccepted by the latter:
I hereby agree to donate to the city
of Shreveport a strip of ground thirty
feet in width running the full length of
my property from Louisiana avenue to
Creswell street on Stoner avenue, in
consideration that the city of Shreve
nort shall - ave and curb the full lengthl
of - said property on Stoner avenue
without expense to myself, I agreeing to
lay a sidewalk the full length of my said
property and make the necessary water
connections.

Following petition was presented:
To the Mayor and Council of the
City of Shreveport, La.: Gentlemen
We, the undersigned, property owners
and residents in your city, believing
that the welfare of the city demands it,
do respectfully petition your honorable
body, that you cause a street to be
opened for traffic-through the property
of Mr. E. Laenger, beginning on the
west side of Texas avenue at a point
onposite Gary street in the Cagle sub
division, being a distance of about 200
feet: Your attention is also called to the
memorandum attached hereto. Respect
fully submitted.

MEMORANDUM
t. The strip of land which the city
is asked to purchase or expropriate is
only 60 feet by 2oo feet.
2. The cost should not exceed $3,oco.
t. Gary street, with this single ex
ception, is already open from Pierre
avenue on the west to the J. B. Smith
succession property on the east.
4. Jordan street, west of Texas ave
nue. being only 3o feet wide for a dis
tance of 15oo feet before it becomes a
full width street, and Murphy street
being only 25 feet wide for a distance
of I8oo feet, do not furnish adequate
facilities for traffic for the people in
this section of the city.
5. It will be cheaper to open Gary
street than it would be to widen either
Jordan or Murphy streets.
6. The increised valuation of the
-rooerty in this section thus made more
accessible and the consequent increase
in the assessment will justify this ex
penditure by the city.
7. The property to be expropriated is
constantly- increasing in value. The
work will have to be done in time. It is
economical to do it now.
8. It is a right which the people who
live there possess by reason of the po
sition of their-property.
. Each and every member of your
body is requested to make a personal
investigation of the situation, for we be
lieve that such an investigation will
show the absolute necessity for this
work.
