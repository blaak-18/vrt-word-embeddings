Walter Jackson Grills Bryan
Claims the Commoner Stole Campaign Scheme He Had
Copyrighted—Jackson is Writing a Book in Which
He is Laying Bare Bryan*s Double Dealing
and Theft of Ideas—lncident Fair Test
of Bryan's "Greatness.”
Walter Jackson, manager of the
World’s Desire Bureau of this city, is
writing a book to prove William Jen
nings Bryan stole the logic of the
1908 Democratic campaign and cam
paign methods from the World’s De
sire Bureau.
Long before the Democratic con
vention Mr. Jackson copyrighted a
scheme to help elect Bryan, and sub
mitted it to Mr. Bryan and to every
Democratic senator and congressman
and to every member of the Demo
cratic National Committee. The Trib
une is thoroughly familiar with Mr.
Jackson’s case against Mr. Bryan.
The scheme in question was printed by
the Tribune. Here in Chillicothe the
close friends of Mr. Jackson watched
Mr. Bryan take up one idea after an
other, and commented on the in
justice being done Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Jackson has issued the follow
ing statement:
“Mr. Bryan and the Democratic
National Committee are indebted to
the World’s Desire Bureau for the
pillars of strength of the 1908 Dem
ocratic campaign, to wit:
“First, Shall the people rule?
“Second, True measure of reward.
“Third, Heir to Roosevelt.
“Fourth, Permanent prosperity.
“Fifth, A period of fasting in the
'rilderness is necessary to reform the
Republican party.
“Sixth, Relying on the common
people.
“Seventh, Appealing directly to
the people for campaign funds.
“Eighth, Promising to be loyal to
the common people to whom Bryan
will owe his election.
“This logic of the campaign was
originated by the World’s Desire Bu
reau and combined in a movement
the object of which was to array the
masses against the classes. The dif
ferent phases of the campaign were
developed by letter. Over ninety
pages of single-space typewriting
were directed to Mr. Bryan and the
committee.
“The chief difference between the
way the Democrats are carrying on
the campaign and the way I outlined
it before the Democratic convention
is I had the voters join the Solar
Sphere Society, while Mr. Bryan has
them join a precinct club. I dressed
the logic of the campaign in a non
partisan garb, Mr. Bryan stole my
logic and put Democratic clothes on
it.
“Mr. Bryan apparently looked up
on me as a competitor and proceeded
to eliminate me by the cut-throat
methods attributed to Standard Oil.
I have invested over three months of
hard labor and about SSOO in cash.
Instead of calling me to Lincoln and
making a satisfactory settlement or
arrangement, Mr. Bryan took up one
idea after another until he had stolen
the whole of my logic. While this
absorbing process was going on I tried
to make nwsplf believe Mr. Bryan
was merely outlining the campaign to
fit mv scheme preparatory to taking
it up. I think Mr. Bryan’s program
£>l)4 Jeffersonian
was to rob me and keep me pacified
until he could have his committee say
it is too late to make a deal with me,
I have all the evidence I need to
prove Mr. Bryan guilty—guilty of the
smallest and meanest act ever com
mitted by a presidential candidate.
“My experience with Bryan was a
fair test of his greatness. Great men
are quick to recognize merit and give
credit. Bryan never gives credit.
Bryan not only wishes to be elected
president, but he wants the world to
think he elected himself president.
Consequently Mr. Bryan gathers
around him no brilliant men. Brains
disqualify. Bryan is jealous of abil
ity. His lieutenants are servants.
Bryan’s colossal egotism and un
natural vanity force his intoler
ance, selfishness, prejudice, unfair
ness, and dishonesty. It therefore
would be a great mistake to elect
him president, for his egotism and
vanity would cause the whole nation
to suffer as I have suffered.”
The World’s Desire Bureau is a
national institution. It has about
5,000 friends throughout the United
States and it is known to several
million people.

One thing is certain, Democrats

It seems that one millionaire is
getting his due for his dishonesty.
Morse, the high financier, who ap
pealed against the decision of the
trial judge in refusing him bail, be
cause he could easily pay any bail the
court could name and go free. The
court of appeals, Judges Lacombe,
Ward and Cox, says Judge Hough’s
grounds were well taken and refused
to reverse the decision. This leaves
Morse in jail where he ought to be
until December 3, when his case
comes up on a writ of error. It is
hoped that the sentence of Judge
Hough to 15 years imprisonment at
hard labor may be enforced as there
is no doubt of his guilt.—St. Johns
(Oregon) Review.
CANNON’S CONSTITUENCY.
“Uncle Joe” is doubtless a sinner.
But he is a very frank, open r.nd‘
above-board sinner. He is also a fight
ing man in politics. He went bes ire
his constituents and, despite his recor l
of sinfulness and tyranny, they gave
him a vote of confidence and a com
mission to represent them in the house
for another term. Either they did
not believe that he is totally depraved,
as he was represented to be by his op
ponents, or else they are themselves
wicked and depraved men, enamored
of tyranny and proud of their owr.
unworthiness. —Baltimore Sun.
