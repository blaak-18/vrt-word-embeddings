curred to me that tlhe Indian g*irl had
taken a fancy to one of them, and not
realizing that I would particularly
care ®bout its loss, had appropriated
it to her own use.
“ 1 Annie,’ I asked, ‘you sure didn’t
take that pin?’ I hope I may never
see a woman as angry as the meek
and amiable Annie was the next
minute. I had offered her the last
word in the language of insult—the
suggestion that she would steal, and
from a friend, at that ’ She talked in
Indian and English at the same time
and the way in which she dressed me
down was a work of aboriginal art.
For a little while, it looked to me as
if she would tear my hair out or go
after me with <a knife. Probably she
would have used the knife, if one had
been at hand the moment when her
anger blazed up the fiercest.
“But, after a little while, I calmed
her down and inside of an hour she
was singing a had learned
at the mission. Os all the mercurial
temperaments I’ve ever come in con
tact with that of poor little half-sav
age. Annie could show the swiftest
fluctuations.
“Before spring opened up in good
earnest, I had managed to bring about
a separation between Bill and myself
and to do it without opening up any
bad blood—which was something of
an accomplishment considering the
fact that Bill’s blood was decidedly
" tainted and always on the point of
eruption. Beside, he was as undesir
able as an enemy as he was as a
partner.
“I moved my belongings into a
shack about a mile away. The first
night in my new quarters, while I was
busy arranging ray things, I heard a
soft knock at the door. I opened it
and there stood the frousy-headed,
shapeless little waif of the wilder
ness, her straight, black hair hanging
in strings, but her shoe-button eyes
blight with the light of high resolve.
“She edged timidly into the room
and sidled along the wall until she
could stand behind the stove. From
this half sheltered point of vantage
she watched me in furtive, abashed
silence. I knew tfoe had something on
her mind that would come out in her
own time and in her own way. Evi
dently, she was laboring under a great
strain of basfalfulness as well as ex
citement. Mental exertion was an un
familiar form of exercise to Annie
and she made decidedly hard work of
it. To give her time to gather her
wits, I continued my work and whis
tled as I pottered about the room.
“This thing of having a woman call
at my solitary cabin in the evening
was decidedly unconventional, and I
realized it fully; but I also realized
that it might be decidedly important
for me to know what had created
an agitation in her simple mind.
It might be possible, I said to myself,
that Bill’s bad blood had suffered an
unusual eruption and his thoughts
had taken a sudden turn in my di
rection, becase I had not stuck with
him. In fact, it was quite possible
that he had gone off on a rampage
and that Annie had come to warn me
to look out for him. Her first words
had. a suggestion of this for she sud
denly blurted out the question:
“ ‘You —Bill—quit?’
“ ‘Yes; we’ve quit,’ I answered.
“ ‘Bill no good, me no like,’ she
responded with conviction. I waited
for the next installment and it finally
came in the first proposal I ever had
put to me by a young woman.
“ ‘You take it?’ she asked sol
emnly.
“I knew perfectly well what she
meant, for she always spoke of her
self as ‘it,’ but J pretended not to
understand and replied:
“ ‘Take it? Do you mean take
you ? ’
“She nodded.
“ ‘No,’ I answered. ‘I don’t care
to marry.’
“ ‘What’s matter —you no like it?’
she persisted, as if she were asking
my opinion of the morning’s pan
cakes.
“ ‘Yes; 1 like you all right, An
nie,’ I responded, ‘but I don’t care to
turn squaw-man like Bill. I don’t
like squaw-men.’
“She thought this over for a long
time, blinking solemnly from her post
behind the stove. Just as I was con
vinced that my first misplaced leap
year proposal was over she broke into
tlhe next round of argument
“ ‘Me plenty work—all time cook.
Plenty 'wood chop; no eat much. You
take it?’
“ ‘Nothing doing, Annie. No
squaw-man!’ I answered with a
solemnity and conviction which finally
carried home. After my meaning had
at last been absorbed, she slid along
the wall as shyly as she had entered
and made her escape out of the door.
When she had been gone for some
minutes the absurdity of the whole
situation came over me in such a wave
that I rolled on my bunk and laughed
as I hadn’t laughed since I came into
the country. Solitary men, in a soli
tary country, do most of their laugh
ing inside —but the comicalness of the
whole affair came over me so that I
fairly yelled and groaned aloud. Per
haps I didn’t feel quite as heartless
and as flattered as the girl who turns
down a.n awkward and ill-sorted
suitor, but it was near enough to it to
suggest it to me.
“After that I fell in with a jolly
Irishman and we went to work a
claim way up the mountain side on a
high bar —about a thousand feet above
the creek bottom. One end of our
cabin burrowed its nose into the side
of the mountain while the other looked
out over the tree tops. We had a
hand-made front yard which might
have suggested the hanging gardens
of Babylon to a stray sky-pilot. It was
made of logs laid up in the shape of
cribbing filled with dirt —the founda
tion of the cribbing being a rocky
shelf about thirty feet below our front
door steps. It was a good stiff day’s
work to climb from the creek bottom
to our nest up on the mountain side
and we were fully ten miles from
town.
“In tihe we were practically
prisoners, for, in Alaska, at that sea
son of the year the ground is so soft
and mushy that a man breaks through
at every step. Well, one night that
spring, as Mike and myself were sit
ting in the cabin smoking and reading
a couple of last year’s newspapers, I
was startled by a scratching sound at
the door. We listened a while and
finally I exclaimed:
“ ‘There’s certainly something or
somebody outside there, trying to get
in.’
'Glje 3effersonian
“‘Can’t be a person,’ returned
M'i'ke ‘Nobody could make tlhe climb
up here in a. night like this. ’
“But the scratching began again
and Mike called out: ‘ Come in! ’
“After a moment’s suspense the
door was softly opened and I saw one
gleaming black eye peering in. We
sat quietly and a moment later the
door opened a little wider, revealing
another bright and beady eye and a
copper-colored nose. Then the head
of Annie the Amiable poked itself
into view.
“ ‘Come in, Annie,’ I called.
‘What in the world brings you here at
such a. time?’
“Edging along with her back to the
wall she reached her retreat behind
the stove and stood there, flattened
against the wall, her hands nervously
twisting into her coarse skirt which
was soaked nearly to her hips. At a
glance it ‘told the stoiy of the creeks
she had waded, of the mire through
which she had floundered, of the climb
up the face of the mountain in the
darkness. I felt that she must have
been in deep trouble to have made
such a journey—a trip which the
hardiest prospector would have under
taken only when driven by some ur
gent necessity.
“‘You sick?’ she finally asked;
‘you send for it?’
“ ‘No; I’m all right, Annie. I
didn’t send for you.’
“ ‘Man say so.’
“While she was eating the supper
that Mike cooked for her I managed
to get at tlhe truth. Some thought
less acquaintance of mine who knew
that Annie regarded me as her pro
tector, had said to her that I wanted
to see her. That was enough for her.
1 had stood between her and the bru
tal mutineer and, believing that I was
sick or needed her, she had unhesi
tatingly started out for the cabin on
the high bar. Every step she had
taken in that ten-mile tramp had been
in mire up to her knees and two or
three times she had been obliged to
wade swollen streams. And then, in
the darkness, she had climbed the side
of the mountain.
“She was only an ignorant, un
couth little savage—just a little higher
in intellect and morals than an ani
mal —but the intimation that, some
how, I stood in need of her had been
enough for her; she had endured an
amount of hardship and exertion that
would have been a test of the strong
est friendship between men. I’m not
ashamed of the fact that it made a
lump come to my throat as I thought
it over.
“We made her comfortable for the
night, gave her a present of a few
ounces of gold and the next day she
trudged back to town —without a sign
of regret that she had come on her
mistaken errand. She had simply be
lieved me to be in trouble, had found
that I was safe and well and was
satisfied with the results of her in
vestigation. ’ ’
Here the young man from the wild
north paused a long time, and finally
broke the silence with the remark:
“Tomorrow night I’m going to un
dertake a proposal myself; if I win
I will get a wife who would go
through what that absurd Title savage
did —and did it just because she
thought that the man who had pro
