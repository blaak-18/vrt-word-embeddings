It is utterly impossible Fo'
dreamers or theorists to cotlteuid
that Louisiani, or any other State
for that matter, can Ihe riled by
ai liixtilre of 'races, whlen those
races relres't'siit the extrel'mes ill
char'acter, class andl cast, as in
the white ant black races. The
bitter e(x''riencle of te('n yars is
an irrefiutablel answer to thet milk
sop who woul argue for any
other concluslion than thle cor
iplete dominance of the white race.
All iwhite men are a unit, how
ever, on that point, and the black
man must learn it sooner or later
-the sooner the better for him
and his. Blunt and his crowd
must know, and know fromn this
on, that the intelligent white rmian
intends to rule IAouisiana: in Camp
and Court, and that the last ves
tige of negro dominance must ie
stamped out. No white malin in
tends to deprive or curtail the nie
groes rights. Ile is a citizen he
ftre the law, and will be held and
esteemedl(l as seluch y the white
race. But there are pririlehge
whlich the whlite( race will never
accord an intferior race, and that
is the privilege to rue theim.
The neg'o (ot' courll'se we eak of
the masses) is ilot fitted by edlu
cation to rule himislf, nmuclh less

sorrowful exaimple of the utmlost

Some doubt existed in the early
of the sitting of this Court as to
whether a negro charged with the
crime of larceny could lie convicted, I
that doubt from twlo weeks trial has
Sdrown to a solid, substantial con vic
tion that lihe or she cannot be. 11Mr
der, manslaughitcr or asault, theI
t. average negro juror is open to law I
and evilde nce upon, but in a case of
he hog, corn or cattle stealing, the thing
COIcomes e(ntirly too near home, and he t
will not entertain fol a moment facts
or law, but summarily acquits every
s- person so charged. That this criticisem
is not overdrawn, we beg to submit
tl three cases as samples ; and we ven.
tlre the assertion that no Philadel

bles to acquit, that these predeter
