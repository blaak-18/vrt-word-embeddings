A Third Party.
As the time approaches nearer and
uearer for political parties to organ
ize and look around, to gather togeth
er their friends, and learn the whlere
abonts of their enemies, notice is nec
essarily called to those wanderers and
nonderscripts, who cannot be placed
in either category. They have been
droped from the rolls of the Demo
cratic-Conservative party, principal
ly by their own acts, or utterences,
and either from false pride or selfish
motives, cannot get their own con
sent to ask reinistatement, or they
have been coquetting with the Radi
cal party, and learned there is no
chance for them there, consequently,
in this loneliness and dejection, they
propose in, their strength and high
minadedness, to organize a New Party!
I A great Reform Party. A party un
der whose broad wings every shade,
color, and complexion of politicians
n may gather, and find a safe refuge in
peaceful security in this mighty cas
r tie of Reform. Of course, all this is
- coming out on the hand bills, and
will form the main feature in the
published programme. Everybody
k, ill be invited to the feast, and a
0 Ulorious feast will it be. A regular
pot-pourri, originating within the
narrow circle of disappointed politi
cians, grumbling malcontents, politi
cal bummers, and general disorgani
zers, it will form a medly, curious to
behold, and in this stage of Louisiana
, politics, will form a mass of incon
gruons elements, and in the place of
being venerated and deified, as they
hope, will only excite ridicule and
. contempt.
But what do they care for the pres
ent or future welfare of Louisiana
What interest have they in her pros
perity i Nothing! absolutely nothing I
They do, however, care for one thing,
and that is their ownselves. They
propose to get up some disaffection
! among the white people, and draw
off with them a few voters, they also
, propose to flatter a few colored voters
by promises of reward, that they
never expect to fulfill, and by these
means' to get enough foolish persons
. to follow them, so as to make suf
ficent numbers appear on paper, as to
give the claim of being styled a party.
After this recognition, then they will
be opened to propositions, "compro
mises," "half the offices," and "di
visions of spoils" &c. This will be
their game, and by this means they
hope to work themselves into power,
and into office r According to our
humble judgment, they will be utter
ly disappointed in their calculation,
for onereason alone, if none other,
and that is this, they have nmistaken
r entirely, the character of the coming
campaign, and the temper of the peo
ple who will engage in it, for every
man will be brought face to face with
the fact, "whether he is for us or
against us?" and as sure as the time
comes, there will be no middle ground.
For those who desire to stand incon
veniently in the way and obstract the
march of events, they will get one
thing, if nothing worse, the lasting
contetnpt of their fellow men.

The Killing of Regieter,
The plain facts in this case, are
about as follows: Frank Moore, who
Idone the killing, had just returned
from New Orleans, and called on
Register for the payment of a School
Warrant, amounting to one'hundred
and fifty dollars. In the place of re
"ceiving the money tor his warrant,
he received insult and abuse; Regis
ter using such language to him, can
cerning a young lady of this parish,
Sas would justify any gentleman re
sorting to violence. Register added
blows to ipsult, and attempted to
draw his pistol; then it was that
Moore struck him with his knife, in
flicting a slight wound, they elosed
with each other, and when Moore
freed himself, hlie struck thie fatal blow,
which was some where in the neck
They were then separated and Moore
gave his knife to a bystander. From
a letter read from a. gentleman living
in Colfax, we see it stated "that eve
ry one who witnessed the affair re
gard it as a case of justifiable homi
cide."
SPrank Moore was a Confederate
soldier, and is well connected in this
parish. From a severe wound re
ceived in the army, had lost the use
of one arm, and depended upon
school-teaching for a livelihood.
Judge (t) Register came to this
State soon after the war, and was at
first engaged in the tanning boasies,
at Shreveport; soon afterwards he
became a Radical .olice-holder, and
in that capacity has made himself,
both, odious and notorious in this
State.
By reference to the card of Mr. L.
H. BtDaDoc, published in to day's is
suee it will be seen that he has opened
a Boarding House, in the Narciase
Prodhomme building, where he is
prepared to accommodate the pub
lie with bed and board in a fine and
elegant manner.' All the delicacies
the, market and country affords will
be found.on hise table, and the "string
of his lateh will always be on the
viiside." Give him a call, and we
are certain you will not want a better
table, ~leaner beds, or more polite at

Organization.
Time is passing, we are marching
on to important events, and still we
take no steps towards organization.
Is it possible that our people have
lost their nlaterest in the importance
I of the coming election t Now gen
I tlemen of the country wards, you
p have as much at stake as any of us,
and as the complaint has been made
that the town always wants to con
trole everything, and every body.
I You can come forward and shape this
canvass to suit your own ideas, for
the "Town clique" has no disposition
to absorbe all the offices, nor are they
disposed to undertake all the work.
There exist throughout the country a
feeling of antagounsm to the town,
which is all wrong, and without any
Sjust cause. The town does not de.
sire to arrogate anything to herself,
nor does she wish to dictate any
a course of action for the gentlemen of
the country to follow, but she does
- desire to see the party thoroughly or.
a ganize and put on a sound footing,
I prepared for the work before them,
B and in expressing this desire, they
r can all truthfully say, "They have
s no friends to reward, nor enemies to
r punish, in their own ranks," but are
a willing to meet the gentlemen from
the country to freely discuss the plans
Sof the campaign, allowing no seldahi
motives, for a moment, to tinge or
a tincture then acts, and with an eye
a single to the great aim in view, they
will work, earnestly and harmonious~
f ly to the final completion of the task
y set before them.
j We would, therefore, beg of the
country gentlemen to .disard any
idea they may have of the "town"
? wishing to appropriate anything to
its self, for it is certainly doing a
I great injustice.
Sow Wheat.
n We would recommend our farmers
r to plant a few acres in wheat, this
o year, and try the experiment. Al
a though we have no Flouring Mills in
s this section, the wheat will make the
e more nutritious bead without the
a bolting, and the mills in common use
F- throughout the eauntry will serve
0 the purpose until more complete ap
·. paratus can be constrgcted.
II It is a curious fact, and one that
- house-keepers may be disposed to
- disbelieve, it is nevertheless, a fact,
e that the bran rejected from the floor
9 is nearly four times as nutritious as
, the flour. "Wheat flour," says a eel
r ebrated Chemist, "from the Mill,
consists mainly of Starch, the blood,
, flesh, and bone, forming materials or
elements of the grain, are rejected in
a the bran, because of the ignorat opin
g ions of other generations." Accord.
lug to this authority, the bran from
y the wheat, which is carelessly thrown
Saway, is of more importance than the
r flour itself. Any farmer in this sec
e tion could plant three or five acres in
. wheat, and with a little care and at
tention, he would have suficient for
e all his wants. It is true, the bread
a made in the manner spoken of above,
gI would not suit the fastidious tastes of
boose-wives, who have been accus
tomed to bread blane comme la aaiqe,
yet after they would get into the harb
! it of using unbolted floor, nothing
would induce them to change, for or
Sdinary daily use. Try it.
Burmuda Hay.
I This is the time of year for our
-farmers to prepare the feace aund
, grounds for the making of Burmuda
SHay.. There is no place in the South
where this grass grows to such per
ufection, as in this parishi, yet, strange
to relate, the hay is being imported
I from a neighboring parish! On a
Sgreat many of the plantations here,
t nothing but Barmnda grass grows,
- but ihe proprietors have not the eno
1 terprise and industry to gather it,
a and make hay of it, which requires so
Slittle out-lay of labor and capital.
As to the quality of the hay, it baa
been acknowledged by all whe have
I sed it, to be superior to Western
Timothy, for feeding to any kind of
cattle, borses, &.c . Mules are par
ticularly fond of it, and can be "kept
-up" on it, through the entire winter.
Still, for all that, our farmers sit
Idown here, and thbleMesy mee its
I brought to our very doomrs for sale,
from the parish of Bspides I When
'if they would go to work' now, build
I fonces, level the groiund, cat Qi the

Iand vast quantitis of this bay can be
taken off, with comparatively little
expense, and it ean always be sold at

A Few of the Late Frauds.
For nine years the Committee on
War Expenditures, had been in regn
lar session, and found nothing "crook
ed," until a majority of Democrats
were appointed, and in less than no
time, they unearth the celebrated
Belknap swindle, which was duly ac
knowledged by him, when brought
before the Committee. The charges
were unlawful trading in the Fort
" Sill and other post-tradership. For
I money paid to him by one Caleb P.
rMarsh, the Fort Sill tradership was
disposed of, out of which large sums
of money could annually be made by
extortionate prices, charged for all
things in common use, and could not
be procured elsewhere. He, (Belknap)
sent in his resignation, which was
immediately accepted by the President
Gen. Schenck, American Minister
at the Court of St. James, was forced
to resign, in consequence of the part
he took at "promoting" the Emma
Ming busfess, and by whose influence
the British people were swindled out
of large sums of money, and his re
signati'on had to be accepted, and he
e was forced to leave England, w'ithout

S PLAXT Cons.-It is not too' late
n for farmers to plant corn and make a
n good crop, and if they will go to work
e determined to succeed, they will be
astonished at the resu.t. Just think
"of it? one acre of good land, well
Stilled, will yield corn enllougl to make
r bread for an entire family through
out the year, then the calculation is
easy how much it will require for the
stock on the place, and how much
surplus is wanted. Cotton will not
be any more remunerative this year
than it was last, and how our farm.

Memory of Animals.
We had related to us one day this
week, a curious case of memory, as
exhibited by two cows belonging to a
gentleman of this city, whose word
cannot be called in question. Seve
ral years ago lie had in the city, a
cow with a calf, and after the calf had
grown to be a respectable yearling
and able to do for itself, he sent said
calf to his plantation in the country,
where she thrived, and like all other
calves of the female gender would do,
in the course of time she had a calf.
However, not coming up to the stand
ard of "town cows," she was kept on
the plantation, while the mother cow
was still enjoying the love and con
fidence of the family in town. Time
passed on, and the country cow gave
birth to another calf, and this time
she won the favor of the family, and
I was in due course of events, brought
up to town to have the satisfaction
and pleasure of affording milk to the
family, as her mother had done, du
ring her calf-hood, and, in fact, was
performing that pleasing duty at the
tiimn of the arrival of the country
cow, her worthy offspring ; as a mat
ter of course, they met, and after
three years of painful separation,
they recognized each other, and as
the one idea lingered on memory's
record in the mind of the daughter
cow, which was prominent when she
was cruelly torn from her maternity,
so it was made manifest in their
meeting, for she inmmediately seized
the teat of the mother, and began
that pleasant operation she had so
fondly enljoyed when she was yet in
f the "ropes and cowpens" of her et
istence. The mother cow fully recog
nised her offspring, and fondly "cow
licked" her, as was her wont in days
of yore, thus establishing beyond a
doubt, that the recognition was mu
tual and instantaneous.

A Great Outrage.
SThe Democratic majority in the
SLower House of the General Assem
. bly of the State, at the last session,
succeeded in passing a bill remitting
Sthe penalties on back taxes, sent said
.bill to the Senate for its eoncurrence,
. and thought everything was perfect,
i except thie signatures, when the mat
ter was examined it was discovered
F that some rascally member of the ring
had got hold of it, and after the bill
had passed, interpolated an amend
ment. The New Orleans Democrat
of the 25th nit., speaking of the vile
frand, in concluding a long article on
the subject, says:
A flagrant fraud has been perpetra
ted which will rob the taxpayers of a
million of dollars; the journal of the
Senate has been doctored to sustain
the fraud; the court rules the journal
is conclusive. Freemen of America,
contemplate with pride and admira
tion the edpleteness of infamy!
The people of Loaisiana lhave but
one remedy against such a villainy as
this, and that remedy is to swing
those implicated in it to a lamp post.

WASr!IXGTON, D. c. March 21, 1676.
Hon. Sam. J. Randall, Chairman of
the House Committee on Appropri
ations, has more than fulfilled the ex
pectations of the people, in reducing
expenses in every department of the
Government. Af course he is round
ly abused by the republican press,
and, to some extent, as I am sor
ry to see, by democratic papers. This
is very unfair. The press and the
people have been for years, howling
for retrenchment, reformn, the cutting
down of salaries, etc., and now that
we have at length got a man in the
chair of the Committee on Appropri.
atious wkh nerve enough to perform
an unpleasant but necessary duty,
many papers and persons that screech
ed loudly for reform, are abusing him
for having Inasgutated it. The fact
is, every nan is anxious to have his
neighbor's salary cut down, and will
even mildly approve of a reasatiable
percentage being lopped offlfrom the
salaries of his wife's relations, for the
public good. I have to meet, how
ever the first man in government erm
ploy who thinks that he, himself,
gets too much for his setrvices. But,
far better than a reduction of salaries
is the reduction of the force that Mr.
Randall proposes in nearly every de
partment. The Heads of Depart.
ments called for 4,015 employes. Mr.
Randal cuts this number down to 3,
G;I, thus saving to the Government
the salaries of 1,001 employese.
A "TIIOUGHTFUL BROTHERI."
The National Republican has an ar
ticle to-day, in which it says, of Pres
ident Grant : "He is a kind husband,
a tender father, thoughtful brother,
and a most loyal friend. His nature
is a generous one." This cannot be
denied, whatever else may be said
against him. A "tender father!"
Did'ut he make his sun, just from
West Point, a Lieut. Colonel over the
heads of vaterans of twice his age,
and send him to make the tour of
Europe ? What was it to him if he
violated law and regulations f Was'nt
he a "tender father f" and, as for be
I ing a "thoughtful brother,'" did'nt he
write to his dear brother, Awful Grant
all about those post-traderships that
were "going to be' Vaeant," so that
Awful could make the necessary ar.
rangements for selling the places ?
And his "nature is so generous." He
knew that Awful would make a good
thing of it, and he did'nt even whisper
"halves," once. Ands with the whole
a family "on the make,"s ad evetryldy
around him gettingrich, he ha. never
even noticed it--mach less demanded
his "rake." He's so "generoUs.'f And,
I as to being a "loyal friend--well,
l Babcock, and imes Shepherd, and
Delano, Tom furphy, esl, know all
about that. And Belknap knows,
too-Grant stands b'y Ielkanp yet
for the Republican says that the Pres
ident is entitled to all the credit ot
bringing Marsh back-that he did it
of his own accordv and not because
the House Judiciary Committee asked
him to, and that "Bekhap's esoasel
is teceedingly auto., that Marsh shall
come back, and sagy that if Marsh can
be secured, Belknap's inuacenee of the
charges can be faly establishedr" And
so the President bas promised Marsh
Iumunity, and he is coming. If this
had been in an anuti-admtnistration
Spaper, I should'i have believed it;
but the Republican is as "organ.
A RULE TAf ADON'' WORK O81 WATe.
The same people who blame Mr.
Clymer and his committee lfr letting
Marsh go, after he had answered
- every question pnt to him, and when
there was no apparent reason for hol
.ding him, and no legal right to do so,
are now howling with rage'at the im
prisonment of Hallett Kilbourne, by
order of the House, becas he re
fuses to produce the evidence de
I manded. It makes a great deal of
difference whose foot "the shoe pinch
Ss." It is now proven, beyond a
question, that Grant was interested
in the Real Estate Pool, and that it
was to conceal that facet, among oth
era, that Kilbourne refused to produce
his books. But the records show the
facts, and Mr. Kilbourpe will dad it
, useless to attempt to suppress them.
The same questions were asked him,
during the District of Colombia in
vestigatiqu by a House Committee of
Sthe Forty-Third Congrees, that are
I asked him now; and he refased to
answer them, as be does now. But
no notice was taken by the House of
[ his refpsal. While there was a major

Sof involving any high ofcial in the
scandal that the Washisgton Real
SEstate Pool had brought on the Ad
Sministration.
THE GENERAL OUTLOO.
If there be any truth in the com-rn
monly received idea that the darkest
hour precedes the dawn, ire moust
surely be standing upon the eve of a
revelation which will clear up mueh
of the mystery and gloom ia which I
the nation is now enveloped. For a
darker day, or a more painful and
Ihuomilating position, has never be
fore fallen ,to the lot of the United
States. With corruption at the seat
of Government, and distrust and fear
among the people, the whole land
seems to be thrown into the horrors I
of a crisis from which it will emerge
debilitated and disgraced, or with
stronger principles nd purer morals,
and therefore all the better prepared
for aworthy celebration of its Cen
tennial, and for the responsibilities
of its futuie career.
The recent proceedings in Wash
ington have not added very much to
the information already possessed on
the all absorbng topics. Matters ino
deed seem to remain ia stats qgo;
and there is, after all, danger that the
prosecution or impeachment of ex
Secretary Belkuap will end in a meto
dramatic farce, in which the principal
actors have already begun to fall foul
of each other. In the absence of the
article of impeachment, the prepor
ation and presentation of which are
unaccountably delayed, General Bel
knap bas been placed under arrest,
cited before a court, and admitted to
bail. He is now awaiting the farther i
action of his accusers. When it will
be taken, or what it will be, nobody
can determipe. The plea is that the
resignation of Belknap reduces him to
the position of a private citisen, and
renders null and void the action ten
ding toward impeachment, and, as a
result of the whole, there is at least a
probability that bhe will escape with
the loss of osffice, and the disgrace at
taching to his character. I
aMR. HESTER CLYManR'S COMMITrrTEE,
to which the country already owes
so much, is making developments iun

with advantage. Such a states
if well substantiated, will prove-
damaging to the President as ton

is to establish a prima facie groe

His narrative was not satisfaetey

admitted much of what has been
charged against him, even to i
the telegram, in connection with -ms.

upon the English people by making
them believe that the mine was on
of fabulous value. He said he regret

In * letter subsequently addressed to
the Chairman of the Committe, he hea
tried to explain away the bearing of
