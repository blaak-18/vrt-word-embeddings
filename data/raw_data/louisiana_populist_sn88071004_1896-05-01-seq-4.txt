Spring
Medicine
Your blood in Spring is almost certain to
be full of impurities-the accumula
tion of the winter months. Bad ven
tilation of sleeping rooms, impure sir
in dwellings, factories and shops, over
eating,.heavy, improper foods, failure
of the kidneys and liver properly to do
extra work thus thrust upon them, are
the prime causes of this condition. It
is of the utmost importaIce that you
Purify
Your Blood
Now, as when warmer weather comes and
the tonic effect of cold braeing air is
gone, your weak, thin, impure blood
will not furnish necessary strength.
That tired feeling, lossof appetite, will
open the way for serious disease, ruined
health, or breaking out of humors and
impurities. To make pure, rich, red
blood Hood's Sarsaparilla stands un

A Womaerful CAve.
A cave alleged to rival in extent sd

Ky., in which Mammoth cave is situ.

tell many stories of the remarkable
character of the new cave. It wasdis
covered by a traveling photographer of
Bowling Green several weeks ago. He
stumbled across an opening in the rocks
and following it downward 60 bet
found himself in an immense cave. He
got others to accompany him in an ex
ploration of the cave, and it is alleged
that more than sixty miles of subter
ranean avenues have been explored.
It is said that a company has bees
formed to exploit the cave; that it will
be lighted with electricity, and that as
electric railway will be built to it,

IA 'UNi LIFE-SAVER.
WILLIE DANIELS HAS RESCUED
THREE PEOPLE.
I. 13 Years Old and Very Madeot-He
Clung to a Pier While a Man Hung
to His Leg - Reluctantly Tells Ills
Own EPory.
ILLIE DANIELS
is about 13 years
old and a hero, but
the fact does not
fill his young soul
witb Joy, says the
New York Herald.
lie is rather un
comfortable about
it, and he wears his
honors as awk
wardly as though
they were the clothing of a prize fat
man. That is perhaps due to the fact
that Willie is an extremely modest lad.
He has saved three persons from
drowning and wonders in a rather un
sentimental way why other folks
should make such ado about it.
He made his third rescue recently.
He rescued 4-year-old John O'Keefe,
at the foot of East 122d street. Willie
is a straightforward, honest lad, and in
telling of this does not try to take all
the credit to himself, but generously
pushes his chum and neighbor, Eddie
McFadden, to the fore. The two losi
rowed a boat that went to the rescue of
the drowning lad.
Willie's mother is a widow and lives
in the top flat, east, of 414 East )234
street. Her married !ife and widow
hood have been passed in that neigh
borhood. Her husband d;ed when Wil
lie was only 18 months old. The life
saver, however, is not the only child.
There Is John, who is 19, and James,
who is three years younger, both of
them bright boys.
When a visit was paid to Mrs. Dan
lels' flat Willie was out on an errand
for his mother. "I don't know whether
Willie will do much talking," said she.
"He's such a curious cort of a lad."
"Yes," said a neighbor, who was sew
ing near one of the windows. "the
youngster is so modest like that when
either of the young wen who board
here are at the table Willie won't sit
down and take a bite; no, niot he."
At that moment the Juvenile life
saver entered the room with a package
in his hand and gazed suspiciously at
the visitor. Then he took off his hat,
handed the package to his mother and.
seating himself at the window, placed
his chin in his hands and gazed in
tently out upon the yards.
"Come, Willie," said his mother,
"this gentleman wants you to tell him
in your own words about the people
you have taken from the river."
The boy did not turn, but his voice
was qita respectful as he said: "I
don't ears to talk about it any more,
mother. I've told it already. What's
the use of telling it again?" And he
lapsed into a determined silence.
Mrs. Daniels went over to him and
there was a short whispered confer
ence. Willie abruptly rose from his
seat and walked through the flat to
the parlor, followed by his mother. In
a few minutes she returned, saying:
"You can see Willie in the parlor. He
won't talk out here," she added, look
ng significantly at her neighbor, sew
ing at the window. Willie sat looking
out of the parlor window, probably the
most uncomfortable lad in the nelsh
borhood Just thean. He answered ques- I
tions in momosyllables until, thawlag
out, he told his story.
"I learned to swim when I was 9
years old," said he. "I can swim over
hand and I ean float, too. All the tel
lows around here are good swimmers.
They ought to be. They play down oe
the float nearly all the year.
"Now I want to tell you something
that is all wrong, The papers said I
saved four people. I dldn't, and I never
said so. There are only three, and the
'kid' that was shed out the other day I
was the third oe. Say, what's the

Then I went in and grabbed him just

A PITIABLE STORY.
One That Exceeds In P.thos the Balled
of "Mltherlri Hlrair."
Little Anne's mother, says the Lon
don News, died within a few days after
her child's birth, and the Infant was
handed over to the tender services of
Grandmother Holberry, who, in the
words of the prosecution, systematical
ly neglected and underfed her and
drugged her with laudanum every
night. Ten drops at bedtime were the
regular dose, and under Its effects the
poor infant was it. a constant rtate of
stupor and able to take but little nour
ishment. Her miserable condition and
"the way she waj being treated" ap
pear to have at racted the attention
of relatives, for the Infant was trans
ferred for a whila to the keeping of a
woman named Rollinson, at Butter
wick. There the child's health rapidly
improved, and a correspondence be
tween the Holblrrys and Mrs. Rollin
son took place on the subject, in which
the former endeavored to exculpate
themselves, the man by throwing the
blame on the grandmother, and the
grandmother by denying that there
was any groun'd for complaint. "I am
glad," wrote the father, "that she has
started eating. I have told them a:
home many a time that I thought she
could eat it they would only treat her
properly." But it did not appear that
he had taken any step t+, secure for his
child the proper treataent which he
confessedly knew to be lacking.
When the child returned to its home,
the old system of drugging and neglect
were resumed, and when at last the
case was taken up by the Society for
the Prevent ion of Cruelty to Children,
the child, then 19 months old, was
found to %aigh only 8% pounds. It
was then, a;,cording to the medical
evidence, in a filthy and emaciated con
dition and suffering from some nar.
cotic. Although there was no organic
disease, the, medical witness expressed
the opinioa that if the treatment had
continued it could not have lived many
days longer. Yet once more under
proper care, little Anne began to re
cover, and to lacrease in weight at
the rate of Ifty-feour ounces a month.
Mrs. Holberry denied the neglect and
attributed the emaciation to the etaect
of teething, but she was found guilt;
and sentenced' to six months' impris
onment, with hard labor, while the
father received the'more severe sen
tence of twelve months' imprisonment
under slnmilar conditions,
