Yesterday a member of the Colora

and do what they can for the good

out the resolution owing to the lan

the member explained that he had
done nothing more than quote the
words used by the governor. The
Western style is vigorous to say the
least.-New Orleans States.

".ty ud aidepend of
farmer cod 1~tter bea&ttiar!ed by
producin articles of home consump
tion than by planting cotton exclusi
vely. Millions of do'lars are sent out
yearly for the purchase of lard and
bacon when we have every advan
tage at our doors to preduce these
indispensable articles. Many farmers
work hard for months to raise cotton
which they often haul to the nearest
store and with the money derived
from the sale, buy pork and other
articles of home consumption,
which, with very little exertion,
could be made at home. The time
expended in raising, picking and
hauling this cotton, if applied to the
production of pork, would have
furnish several times the amount of
meat of as good if not better quality.
The Gazette is pleased to observe
the active interest recently mani
fested by some of our farmers in
this matter. The glut of the rice
and cotton markets and the high
freight tariffs over long lines of trans
portation, should impress everyone
with the necessity of adopting more
economical methods. The one
practiced by our fathers years ago
when the locomotive was unknown
and when there was very little if any
transportation facilities-produce
more of the necessaries of life and
send away less of the fruits of our
labor might not be amiss at the
present time.
THE SUGAR QUESTION.
Times-Democrat.
At the recent conference of sugar
planters held in this city it was re
solved, inter alia, that a committee
representing the sugar industry of
this State should go to Washington
and do what they could to enlighten
Congressmen as to the ruin that
must inevitably be wrought to the
industry in the event of the Wilson
bill becoming a law with the sugar
clause in it as originally drafted.
The committee will point out to
Congressmen the absolute injustice
of the mutilated bounty proposal of
the Wilson bill. It will impress
upon Congressmen the bad faith
that is intended to the sugar planters
in the proposed receding of the
government from the strict letter of
the fifteen years' bounty contract
imposed upon the sugar raisers
their will in 189o. It will show to
Congressmen, by figures which can
neither be gainsaid nor disputed, that
sugar cannot be raised in this State
for less than from 4 1-2 to 5 cents
per pound; that, in fact, as we men
tioned several days ago, the average
cost of raising sugar in Louisiana
for the last six session has been
5.027 cents per pound. It will point
out to Congressmen that sugar equal
in quality to Louisiana sugar is sel
ling in New York at 2 3-4 cents per
pound; and it will ask the simple
question of Congressmen how it
could be possible for the sugar plan
ters of this State, with sugar which
cost 4 1-2 cents per pound to raise
in Louisiana selling at 2 3-4 cents
per pound, to continue the industry
with a bounty or a duty less than 2
cents per pound.
The committee will make it clear
to Congressmen that the mutilated
bounty proposition of the Wilson
bill is not only a glaring breach of
contract on the part of the govern
ment, but that it will mean inevita
ble and irretrievable ruin to the
sugar raisers of this State, we have
sunk their all, and have everything
they own in the world at stake, in
the industry. It will convince, or,
at least, it will do its best to con
vince, Congressmen that nothing t
short of the entire bounty contract t
for the fifteen years, or in its place I
2 cents, per pound duty, will save t
the sugar men from the ruin with I
which the WVilson tariff bill threatens t
them.
And if the committee fail to con
vince Congressmen to that effect, if '
it fail, in spite of its reasoning, to
induce Congressmen to alter the
present proposition back into the C
original fifteen years' bounty con
tract, or to have a duty of a cents C
per pound, put in lieu of that orig- -
inal bounty contract, then will there t
be nothing left for the committee to '
do but to use all the influence they I
are capable of, not only with the
Louisiana delegation, both in House i
and Senate, but with Congressmen C
from other States as well, to vote F
against the bill to its defeat.
The Louisiana delegates to Con- C
gress, both Representatives and Sen
ators, will be, of course, expected
to act in harmony with the commit
tee in this matter. The very life of
the State is bound up with the sugar c
industry, and the first and chiefest i
allegiance of Louisiana's Represen- t
tatives in Congress is to Louisiana's
people. The Representatives from
Louisiana must absolutely refuse, c
therefore, to caucus on the tariff I
bill with the sugar schedule in its i
present condition, and they must
resolutely decline to be bound by E
caucus rulings. Either the original
bounty contract of the tariff bill of,
x89o must-be reinserted in the Wilson t
bill, or, failing that, a duty of a p
cents a pound, must be put on im- ti
ports of sugar. If neither of these
propositions be accepted by the
Congress, then have Louisiana b
Representatives and Senators but -
onp+ duty to perform in the prelises C
4ll 9athat the-biert t, last af
I duty which be disa
eo thea as eocrats to I
, lut its a dt rwhich they
owe to their people and their State, i
and from it we are sure' they will
not shrink.
Grabbing and Bragging
We remember having read a ser
mon with the caption of this arti
cle as a text.
We remember distinctly some pas
t sages even to the very words: -'When
t you hear a person repeating
I the wind-mill language," said the
parson, "that comes like froth to the
growler of untenable averments,
spiced with a lump of jealousy, he
! knows that there are onions in the
I sass," and added "that this ped
dling of adulterated goods is about
the slough-of-despond-est business in
which any but aprofessional Ananias
could engage.
Don't Grab !
"Grabbing," he continues is a bad
egg." It don't pay to grab all you
see. There are men, in the mucila
geousness of their desire, hanker
after everything they see." In busi
ness pursuits, you sometimes find
the "grabber" Grabbing is a
born instinct with him, and his
grabbing propensities are developed
until it becomes a mania. To leave
a trifle for his neighbors would be
an act of generosity which he does
n>t believe should exist.
It is gratifying to know that the
American press 'is outspoken in its
condemnation of the secret methods
which have been adopted touching
momentous national questions. Such
action is thoroughly reprehensible.
An open knowledge of acts affecting
the whole nation is preferable to
strained expectancy, which is apt to
result in worse than denunciation if
public opinion is averse to the course
pursued. Neither President Cleve
land, Secretary Carlisle or the Sen
ate have any right to enshroud public
affairs in mystery, nor will this
people long tolerate such a course,
which is that of kingly and imperial
despotism. The American people
have a right to know everything
touching their foreign relations and
important domestic affairs. Ameri
ca is not an autocracy but a demo
cratic country.--Shreveport Times.
The western whangdoodle govern
ors are having a hard time of it at
present. Mr. Dolph in the United
States senate has just denounced as
false the calamity letter of Governor
Pennoyer to Pres;dent Cleveland,
while the same epistle has been re
pudiated by the Portland, Oregon,
chamber of commerce as "erroneous,
misleading, injurious and not war
ranted or substantiated in any man
ner by facts er conditions." At the
same time the senate of the legisla
ture called in session by Governor
Waite of Colorado to set creation
right side up refuses to print his
message or to take any action on
his recommendations and threatens
to adjourn at once. The reign of the
dog star is on the wane.-Courier
Journal.
Judge Charles Parlange's nomina
tion as United States judge was con
firmed by the Senate on the 17th.
Rose From the Ranks.
The best engineman has been a fireman;
the best conductors are made of brakemen;
the best officials are promoted fromn the ranks.
Mr. John M. Toucey, general manager of
the New York Central, was once a trainman.
President Newell, of the Lake Shore, used
to carry a chain in anengincering corps on
the Illinoas Central. President Clark, of the I
Mobile and Ohio, was a section man; after
wards a fireman. Another man who drove
grade stakes is President Blockstand, of the
Alton. Allen Manvill, the late president
of "the largest road on earth," was a store
house clerk. President Van Horn, of the o
Canadian Pacific, kept time on the Illinois
Central. A man named Town, who used to
twist brakewheels on the Burlington, is now
Vice President Town of the Southern Pacific. P
President Smith, of the Louisville & Nash
ville, was a telegraph messenger-lboy. Pres
ident Clark. of the Union Pacific, used to
check freight and push a truck on the Omaha
platform. The Illinois Central, I believe,
has tnrned out more great men than any
other road. President Jeffery, of the Denver
Rio Grande, began in the Central shops at
forty-five centsaslay.-McClure's Magazine. r
The President hras done his full v
duty in demanding of the Hawaiian
provisional government the restora- -
tion of the government overthrown
a year ago by the unwarranted aid
of a United States minister and
United States troops. The provis
ional government has declined to
permit the act of restoration. The
President can do no more. To do
more would be an act of war, and
the declaration of war rests with
Congress, to whom the administra
tion now submits the case. Now let
those statesmen whose brains have c_
been bursting with solutions of the
Hoawaiian dficulty have full swing. o
