Cavalry Raid on Coushatta !
WIIOLESALE ARRESTS OF PROMINENT
CITIZEN48-NO WARRANTS, NO LAW
THE INTIMIDATION GOES BRAVELY ON.
At an early hour on Saturday morn
ing, the town of Conshatta was sur
rounded by U. S. troops in charge of
U. S. Deputy Marshal,4itockton, and
an indiscriminate arrest of the citi
zens began.
Major Ahney and twelve other pro.
minent citizens were taken in custody
and lodged in the court-house in
charge of the Infantry troops station
ed there.
Stockton, the Marshal, refused to
show any authority for the arrests
and they were made twithout warrants.
No one knows of the charges upon
which the arrests were based, as the
officials were also reticent upon that
point.
Thus the work of intiaidation goes
bravely on, while at one end of the
line we are asked to disband the
White Leagues, at the other, we are
vigorously attacked by the Federal
autho ities in charge of U. S. Marshal
Packard, President of the Central
Committee of the Kelloggites.
Get up another compromise Com
mittee, and we suppose hand-euffs
will be used. Who says Geni. Emory's
troops are not used for political pur
poses I
White men of Natchitoches, to-day
closes the registration of voters, and
now our duty at the.ballot box is to
be done. We wish to keep green in
your minds the remembrance of your
wrongs, the memory of the outrages
perpetrated upon you and yours by
the power of such creatures as Myers,
Bonilt and Blunt. The taxes piled
upon farms, your sustenance wasted,
snd the very efforts of your industry
thwarted; and to impress upon you
that unless you desire s centinuation
of these outrages, you must each and
every one repair to the polls and cast
your vote for the PEOPLE'S ticket.
Our lines are formed-our banners
unfurled-Onward, the enemy is be
fore us.
Some of Morey's Laee.
A reporter of the New Orleans
Timiws, having interviewed Brigadler
General Morey, presents the follow
ing report of what that very distin
guished and very honest warrior has
to say of the election in North Loa
isiana:
The General states that the cotton
crop of that section compares favora
bly with the past yield, and that the
latter crep will ba very much better.
So far as atral violeswus concern.
•ed none existed of which he had been
informed. On the contrary entire
tranquility prevailed so far as he
knew. Buel thIn padshes of Union,
Jackson, Lincoln ad Franklin, a very
bad feeling existed, which might at
ay atimbe tproduective of serious re
ilts.. This condition of safm Was
d-o to the continuous eforts Ibqing
put forth by the more ultra to pre
vent a fall and fkee registration. In
fact, the entire teanor of his Informsa
Lion, derived fira reliable sourees,
wasu that intimidatioin was employed I
in the parishes inadicated. The Coin
promise was bping generally accepted
by the Eeppblicans, who sapported it
beauase its terms only qamanted t
that full registration and free eleqtion f
which under any direummtances the
Republicane of his disrt section
of the Stte of which he proeesmed- a
thorough knowlede-were deeralhed

Collision Between the U. S. Na
val Forces and Metropolitans.
VICTORY FOR TRll MARINE-SIX PEE
LERS SEE BOTTOM OF THE
MISSISLIPI.
Abouthalf-past 11 o'clock this morn
ing, some half dozen Metropolitan po
,f lice, belonging to the Harbor Precinct
arrested on the warf a deserter, be
longing to the sloop-of-war Shawmut,
now lying opposite this city.
They were fired with paitriotie ar
. dor and vailiantly charging the jolly
old tar who had, spliced the main
y brace several, times this morning,
n they succeeded in getting him into a
hired boat and launched out to take
Jack on board the vessel. Gaily the
little bark danced on the waves of the
old Mississipi.
a The strong arm of the Kellogg gov
i. ernment was showing how it could
, protect, in this insurrectionary city,
:the weak and defenseless marines of
a Federal Government. The boat
. sped on, and tears came into the eyes
of the crowd assembled on the wharf
- to see the maguinimity of the chival.
Srous police.
Old Jack seemed to take everything
in jolly humor, and smiling as only
ean old salt can, he waited until the
i boat was some 300 yards out in the
I river, when there was a rolling, a
turning, and six guardians of our
peace were turned out on the bosom
of the Father of Waters.
Jack, leaving the sinking ship, man
fully struck out for shore, followed by
the scions of Pitt. After a race of
five minutes Jack reached shore and
Stuarning.upon his pursuers, derisively
gave one of those main-top-gallant
grins and went off.
This evenihg it is expected Kel
7 logg will open on the fleet for this in
d suit to his legion.-N-. 0. Bellefis.
Prominent among the radical pa
pers of the North that have occupied
a great deal of space, and spent some
I money in publishing our recent trou
I bles to the world, is the Chicago
Inter-Oceas. This paper sent a cor
respondent to this city to write up
Sthe new rebellion. As the Inter.
Oeean wanted something sensational,
this "regular" correspondent proceed
ed to satisfy his employer, sad after
getting through with the city, he
goes to various other cities, and towns,
Sand gives his experiences there. It
was evidently his misfortune to meet
with the worst class of people in the
country. He saw more outlaws, and
heard of more murders, and his life
was risked on more occagions, than
any man we have lately heard of
travelling through the South. He
must have impressed the people gen
erally that he .was a very important
individual, in order that such eminent I
attention should be paid him, and his
life be in suech great demand by the
blood thirsty Southerners. Ordinari.
ly a correspondent of a Chicago pa
per is not considered by the people
so far South a very eminent person
age, however high he may stand in
his own estimation, and when he re
hearses such conversations as appear
in his correspondence, the people en.
erally conclude that his associations
have not been with gentlemen, but
rather with the bummers, legislative
robbers and lobbyists, thatare ar curm
to the South, and whose success de
pends entirely on keeping up the re
belion.-La. Register.
A hateful paragraphist says:
"Whenever a person sitting alongside
of a" woman in the street-car gets up
to leave, in nine eases out of ten the
woman will immediately try to spread
heresaelf so as to cover the.vacanet set
as well as her own. In the pretdnt
scant skirt fashion the effort to:o
this from mere force of hahit is more

Platform of the White People's
Party.
We, the white people of Louisiana, em
bracing the Democratic Party, the Con.
servative Party, the White Man's Party,
the Liberal Party the Reform Party and
all others opposed t he Kellogg usur
upation do solemnly resolve and declare:
1. That the government now existing
in Louisiana originated in, sand has been
maintained by force and fraud, in oppo
sition to the will of a large majority of
the voters of the State; in opposition to
the pnleiples of the Constitution of the
United States and in violation of every
principle of justice and liberty.
9 That the dominant faction of the
Radical party in this State has, by fale
and fraudulent representations, inflamed
the passions and prejudices of the ne
gree sa race, against the whites, and
has thereby made it necessary for the
white people to unite and acset together in
self-defense ardthe preservation of white
civilisation.
3. That the rlihts df all men under the
Constitution and laws of the land must
,be respected and preserved inviolate, it.
respective of race, olor or previous con
ttif.. buat we deny that Cyongre can
Constitationally enset laws to "orce the
two races into social union or equality.
4. That the white people of Louisiana
have no desire to, eprive the colored
people of any rights to which they are en
titled, but we are convinced that the re
forms imperatively demanded, can be
effeeted only by electing to oliee white
men of knowt capaecity and integrity,
and we believe that large numbers o_
colored eitizens will vote with us to se
ore a government which must be bene
Scisil hktq'tgbgth races. ,
5. That we disclaim earnestly any in
tention of carrying, or attempting to ra
y, the approaching election bY~yolepe,
hnd that chg to this effet emanating
from our Radal enemies, are without
foundation sand are falsely made for the
prpose of obtaining the aid of the mUi
it force of the United States in order
ito over-awe the people, perpetuate the
existin ust ng n tad salver` -the tue
prtnipes on d he government.
6. " That WP. Heloj is mere usurp
er and we denounce hm as such, taLt is
government is arbitrary, unjust and op
pressive; and that it can maintain it
self only through Federal interference.
7. That the election and registration
Iaws under which this eleetion is bein
conduoeted were intended to aperptu
the uesrpatioe by depriving te o
pd esply ouar natrranlild eltisem of
an opportunity to register nd vote, but

Mar sad f ree eletion and to e that the

every clime the risht ban I ofello whip

with ours.
SI 9 That while we are in favor of meet
ing punctually the payment of the legit.
imate debt of Louisiana, we are imuliu.
Svably opposed to he recognitions issued
in the name of the State, and we pledge
ourselves to tmake a searching investiga
i tion in the tmatter.
We advise ounr people to vote against
thejamendments to the Constitution pro
posed by the usurping Legislature and
a pledge ourselves on the restoration ofthe
government to honest hands, to provide
for the payment of all honest indebted

The Saturday Evening Post.
The Oldest and Best Story Paper Pub
lished.
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821. ti
For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of thb, Country, and has ever borne a
1 widespread and unblemished reputation
for the unsurpassed purity, refinement
- and excellence of the Serials, Sketches =
and M31 iscellaneous reading matter.
It is pre-eminently
The Best Family Paper
. that in published in this country, from its
never containing anything that would
offend the feelings of any one, either in sF
a religious or political sense, or that
could not be read at any fireside without
objection from the most fastidious.
The circulation of the Saturday Even
ing Post, through not qtuite so large
perhaps, as It. younger contemporaries, *
is not, like that of some of them, lucta
ating, and too often short-lived, but
SVRE, SOLID AND SUBSTANTIAL,
based upon the intrinsic merit of the pa
per itself and not dependent on lany ex
traneous influences, such as the populari
ty of individual writers, &e.
Goodl, however, as the Saturday Even. r
ing Post has been in the past, it is our
intention to make it still better in the
future, and with this object in view we
will effect a marked improvement in eve
ry department of the paper, and will
call to otr assistance writers of admitted
ability and known reputation.
By increasing its former attractions,
and adding many judicious and pleas
ing novelties, by studying how to please
and eltivate the popular taste, by in
ereasiung industry and enterprise, and by
enlarged facilities, we hope to make new
friends with each and every issue, and
continue to maintain the claim of the
Saturday Evening Post to its title of THE
OLDEST AND THE BEBT Of Family tor'y
Papers.
