Ti"e School Board met in regu
lar session Monday, and owing to
the scarcity of funds, but little '
was (lone. p
.Just now that the children, par- It
ticularly in the country wards, td
have nearly finished picking cotton Ih
and would be able to attend schools I
if there was money to establish
them. Why not petition our Po- e
lice Jury to levy a tax of three
mills to be used solely for school
purposes ! It would surely nllhet
with the approval of the public, I
sch(ool patrons, as well a-4 the pub
lic in general. II
While we are on this line, let ut,
call attention to the condlitioni of
the public school ,builling in thi
cily. It is sadly in need of re
pairs and should be attended to as r
soon as possible. If neither the 1i
School Board nor the city will take
the matter in h:nd, why not start o
a subscription. Our peopll will
resl)n(d liberally, and we will soy in
have the building in thorough re- I
pair and an ornament to our city. I

The stench arising from our
streets in certain localities after a
rain, wouhl make a full fledged
pole-cat pale with envy. Some at
tention should be given to better
drainage, as under present condi

cannot be good. Our city has L
been making good efforts, and will
we hope, eventually secure good
and quck drainage. t

An Early (onvenllon.
i Sole of our exchant:g are ad
l vocating a postlponelent of the
national convention of the People's
party to next Ith of July rt,\cen
later.
While they present what may
be considered some very good rea
sons for such postlponement, there
are far IMtter and m,)re urgent
reasonl why we should hnve an
early conuvention.
Contditions are not the same n;)w
that they were four years ago.
The grand union of rformn ftirces
effected at Om() ha, July 4, 1s9"2,
Sw:as the culmination of union ef
fotrts which had been put forth
among different reform organiza
tions for several months plrevious
e to the Omaha meeting.
i It was a work of l)reparation,
. and so thorough and satisfactory
was that work that it does not
have to be repeated for the cowing
camplign.
Our forces are united and com
paratively harmonious.
The work of agitAtion, edui'a
tion and organization has been go
ing on steadily and continuously
for the past four years.
The irinmiples of the Omaha
platform are now uuderstood andi
approved by all ; every true Pop
uHst has them by heart.
It is not at all plrobable that any
new and important issue is likely
to arise which has not already re
ceived due consideration by the
Ameriican people.
The next campaign will be a des
U perate struggle of the people for
political supremacy.
e The People's party has no
schemes or tricks to foist upon the
U public by which they can hope to
profit by a short campaign. We
must win on the merits of our
cause, or not at all.
Our forces are even now ready
and eager for the light.
The sooner we get into line and
Smarch upon the enemy, the better
r will be our chances of scoring a
" victory.
" The convention should be hold
d not later than the 22nd of Februa
ry.
This will secure a better attend
ance of delegates than if held in
Sthe spring or mid-summer when
g the far mners and planters, amoong
r, whom our greatest strength lies,
- will be too busy to attend or even
d give the subject proper attention.
An early convention will give
Stime for ratification meetings to be
Sheld in every schoolhouse and town
Shall before the busy season sets in,
e and opportunity for the great ms
jority of the party to give candi
- iLates and platform a grandi send
off before the "Spring's work"
claims their undivided attention.
e An early convention will be in
P time to facilitate club organization
)e preparatory to the "Spring elec
- tions" and give us many a short,
sharp and decisive victory on the
skirmish line, long before the great
battle commences.
d. An early convention will head
t off and give their quietwr such
rs movements as the "new silver
he party," anm will force into hue or
ke of the party those ambitions
POpulists who advocate leaving the
at middle of the road to take some
short cut through the bushes to
e the White Hpuse.
, An early conventior wilH enable
SPopulist publishers to map out
their work for the caplagn in
he time to sow broadcast double the
an amount of Populist literature that
d they could if the campaign were
Sshortened by half.
