LETTERS.
Charlotte, N. C.» Feb. 25, 1907.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Atlanta, Ga.
Dear Sir —I watch for the arrival of
each number of Watson’s Jeffersonian
Magazine as eagerly as the boy and
girl watch for old Santa Claus. Aft
er reading the February number 1
said it was worth a year’s subscrip
tion. Since looking over the March
number I will say it’s worth two years’
subscription. It’s a hummer. Would
to God that every voter in this state
who is not bound hand and foot, body
and soul to party stakes would read
the magazine.
North Carolina is fine missionary
ground at this time. The old parties
in many sections are clawing at each
other’s throats and we are saying
amen. Very respectfully,
J. P. SOSSAMAN.
For the middle of the road.
Blue Hill, Neb., Feb. 11, 1907.
Mr. Watson:
Dear Sir —Enclosed you will find
money order for $1.50 to pay for Mag
azine one year. 1 would like to have
a copy of your weekly paper. 1 sup
pose your paper treats mostly on state
and local news. The magazine is
more on the line of national politics
that is the reason I prefer the latter;
if you have copies at hand please
start me out with the January num
ber. Yours respectfully,
R. ARMSTRONG.
Cleveland, Ga., Feb 12, 1907.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir —I send you four subscrib
ers for your magazine, have the prom
ise of several more. I will continue
to work for the magazine and paper at
leisure times when the ground is wet
so I cannot plow.
They want the magazine as soon as
you can send it. Yours truly,
WATSON HULSEY,.
Nettleton, Mo., Feb. 25, 1907.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.:
Dear Mr. Watson —I wish to congrat
ulate you on the splendid work you
are doing through your two publica
tions, in educating the people in the
principles of Jeffersonian Democracy.
I may not exactly agree with you on
every point. Your editorials are time
ly, to the point, and are very instruct
ive. Your “Reverie and Suggestion,”
in the Christmas number of the Jeffer
sonian, met a responsive chord in my
heart, for I think I love my wife bet
ter than I did thirty-four years ago
when we were married. Please do not
falter, but keep steadily on, and, the
day is not far distant when the people
will honor themselves and the nation
by putting in practice the principles
for which you have so long contend
ed. Sincerely your friend,
WILLIAM CURP.
Eastville, Ga., Feb. 1, 1907.
Hon. T. EJ. Watson, Thomson, Ga.:
Dear Sir —I received the first copy
of the magazine on Christmas eve and
I assure you that no Christmas pres
ent was ever received with more pro
found gratitude.
A speech of yours, delivered at
Milledgeville, and published in The
Southern Alliance Farmer about fif
teen years ago, was my first introduc
tion.
I was then a lad of nineteen, and
president of a local Farmers’ Alliance
of one hundred members.
vMy father, then a man of sixty,
was lecturer of the same local and
I had him read your speech to the
brethren.
Today the same father and son are
true believers in you and your theory
of government
Through all the chequered vlcissi-
tudes of your career, we have been
constant sentinels on the watch tower
ready to come at your command.
May God bless you and yours, and
give you many years in which to de
fend the cause of true Democracy
and the cause of humanity.
Brisbane’s comments upon brown
eyes hit met all right but it had its
redeeming trait after all. Her eyes are
grey. R. W. HAYNIE.
Deland, Fla., Jan. 21, 1907.
Hon T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.:
The magazine came all right. Would
have written sooner but an engineer
like an editor takes all the time he
can rake up and little more if possi
ble. I am only getting in 16 hours per
day. I read every number of the
New York Magazine. But when you
quit I did also. I enclose you $1.50
for magazine. Tom Dixon can put up
with terrapin stews, but I think life
without the magazine would be kind
er blank. Hoping for you all success.
I am yours truly,
W. A. MORRIS.

Oxford, Ga., Feb. 27, 1907.
I have just been reading your piecp
in magazine, “Not Quite.” 1 read all
you write that I can get. 1 take both
Jeffersonian and Magazine.
When you are gone if there are
enough good people to change the laws
you will live as no other mortal has.
I am going to think for myself and
die believing I am right. And I do
hope you may live on until you can
say well done, I have not lived in vain,
yet we know often that we never see
our good works finished.
May God guard and protect you and
yours and shower upon you every
blessing, is the prayer of your hum
ble servant, W. A. ELLINGTON.

Collinsville, Tex., Feb. 8, 1907.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson:
Dear Friend —Yes, you are a great
friend of the great mass of the people.
Well, Mr. Watson, I am writing you
this letter for the purpose primari
ly of making you a proposition or
in other words to make a request
which 1 do with hesitancy and that
is, that you add a new department to
your Jeffersonian Magazine that is,
a department for young and inexpe
rienced writers. I am sure this would
be popular and of very great benefit
to boys of literary bent. I can’t write
a very legible hand and on that ac
count I can’t get my articles printed
in the body of the magazines. But I
know I have the energy and ambition
and I believe I have the brains and
the talent to make a success in the
great literary field if I had a depart
ment like this to develop the dormant
faculties and there are thousands of
young men of the same opinion and in
the same condition, so you see I have
a selfish, but very laudable motive
in making the request. Now, Tom, do
not consider this matter lightly for
there are a host of young of literary
aspirations struggling to get on their
feet. I sincerely hope to hear from
you on this matter. Respectfully,
J. E. REED.

New York City, Jan 29,1907.
My Dear Mr. Watson:
Here is a helping hand across the
miles. I have bought the January
number of the “Watson’s Jeffersonian
Magazine,” on the newstand, so please
enter my subscription with the Febru
ary number.
I didn’t ask to have my money re
funded, though I had just subscribed a
few months before you left the Wat
son Magazine, because I knew better.
In the Watson Magazine I only read
your editorials, your life of Jackson,
and your answers to questions, in
your new however, I have
read everything and want to say that
THE WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
your “Survey of the World” is as good
as any review which charges $1 a
year and Ann Boyd is certainly a
great story.
I wish you would write more of the
editorials like that on Legare, that on
going to the woods in autumn, up in
the mountains, convalescent.
The lawyers today are playing a
greater part in history than at any
previous time, good and bad, and I
wisH* you would write at times some
thing of the great lawyers of the past,
the idols of the profession then and
today. 1 think it would be interesting
and instructive to all, and especially
to those who, like myself, are study
ing law.
Ending with good wishes for ths
brave fight you are making, 1 am,
Your friend always,
HARRY WEINBERGER.

COST OF CRIME.
in the United States is More Than a
Billion Dollars Yearly.
(From Harpers’ Weekly.)
The cost of crime to the government
reaches the enormous sum of $140,-
000,000. Os this sum $80,000,000 is ex
pended in a certain percent
age of the maintenance of the
supreme and federal courts, United
States district attorneys, United States
marshals, and the' secret service bu
reau; part of it is the cost of crime
to the treasury department to prevent
smuggling, the cost of crime to the ar
my and the navy and to the postoffice
and to allied departments. The gov
ernment losses by smuggling and pos
tal frauds, etc., add the $6,000,000 to
make the aforesaid total. In the last
statement, which is only an estimate
of what the national government pays
for crime, it should be remembered
that there are no reliable figures on
the subject. In estimating the govern
ment losses at $60,000,000 a year for
smuggling, fraud, etc., the writer has
endeavored to keep strictly under the
mark. It is estimated that the govern
ment loses from $75,000,000 to SIOO,-
000,000 a year by smuggling alone,
while the postoffice frauds are believed
to have cost the government some
thing like $40,000,000 a year.
The detailed cost of crime in the
United States presents some astound
ing figures. In 1906 the cost of crime
in Greater New York was $35,562,-
133.24. The state, county, and city
authorities outside of Greater New
York spent for it $42,605,472.75. In
forty-five states (New York exclud
ed) the expenditure was $697,080,000,
Criminal losses by fires totaled SIOO,-
000,000. By customs frauds the nation
al government lost $60,000,000. Dur
ing this one year the loss in wages to
100,000 state prisoners was $28,080,-
010, while the loss in wages of 150,000
prisoners in city and county jails was
$33,000,000. The grand total, there
fore, of the cost of crime in the United
States reaches the stupendous figures
of $1,076,327,605.99.
The cost of religious work in the>
United States is enormous. The cost
of foreign missions, comprising all de
nominations, is $7,000,000; home mis
sions expend the same sum. We spend
for education $200,000,000; for church
expenses and ministers’ salaries, $150,-
000,000. Hospitals and dispensaries for
the sick poor cost us $100,000,000; for
sanitariums of all kinds we spend $60,-
000,000. City missions and rescue work
of all kinds demand and receive $3,-
000,000; humanitarian work of every
kind, $12,000,000. Our Young Men’s
and Young Women’s Christian Asso
ciations cost $5,000,000, while all other
moral and social work in the United
States requires an expenditure of $5,-
000,000. The total expenditure for hu
manitarian and religious work is, then,
$549,000,000. As against this, the to
tal cost of crime in the United States

say, we spend more than $500,000,000

PALMA BRIBED U. S. SENATE.
Remarkable Story Published in Spain
—Cost Just $37,000,000.
By Associated Press.
Madrid, Feb. 28. —A sensation has
been caused here by the publication
of a story credited to the Diario De
La Marina, of Havana, which pur
ports to show by documentary evi
dence that the United States congress
was bought in 1897 by Thomas Estra
da Palma to insure war being declar
ed against Spain.
According to the Havana newspaper
bonds to the value of $37,000,000, re
deemable when Cuba should become
independent, were issued in Washing
ton to senators, and a contract exists
which contains phraseology like that
of the joint resolution of April, 1898,
voted by congress.
The article says further that the
value of the bonds fell heavily in 1899,
and, therefore, a new contract was
made between Palma and the Ameri
can senators. Count Salazar, minis
ter of foreign affairs, has telegraphed
to the Spanish representatives at
Washington for the fullest informa
tion.

months.

shave it off —Prlneeton Tiger.
