cants were after 13,000 claims it is but
natural that there should be thousands
of disappointed persons. And many of
these are more or less inclined to tind
fault. Some of them assume a highly
Smoral attitude and rail loudly against

Sthe allotment. Had the same plan been
Spursued as at former allotments, they
r would have stood less show of getting
a claim than now, for the "sooners"
and "boomers" would have rushed pell
mell across the border and by sheer
force gobbled up the who!e tract.
It was the purpose of the government
to distribute 13,000 quarter sections to
that number of needy home seekers in
line with homestead policy, which has
been very beneticial in dervehing the
west, and furnishing at nominal rates
lands of the punmlic domain to a.1tual
settlers. In so far as possible tinder
the circumstances this has been done
in this instance, and when the claims
are all proved up and the undesirab!e
element, which was naturally attracted
by the allotment, has drifted away, I
think it will be found that there has
been added to the population of the
territory a large and desirable body of
permanent settlers who will honestly
develop the land with which Uncle
Sam has supplied them. That is the
thing In which Oklahoma Is principally
Interested. What the territory. which
It is hoped may soon become a state,
wants is good, usneful and thrifty peo
ple, who come withi the honest pur
pose of making homes and tilling the
lands.
Under this allotment hundreds of
women were enabledul to secure desir
able tracts of lard, a thing which
would have been impossible if the
"sooners" and "boomers" had had their
own way. At the drawing places there
were booths for women, and many of
thenm drew early numbers and got good
claims. No married woman or any
under age, however. coultl register, the
purpose being that only one claim
should go tb any one family. But
there were a few notable exceptions in
allowing married women to register.
For instance. one woman came to the
boothli wheeling an invalid's chair. In
it was her husband, whom she had to
support. On these grounds she was
allowed to register. Another woman
lately divorced asked to register, but
was disqualifed becanse her divorce
had not been granted long enough.
"But," she said. "what am I to do? I
have been married six times, and every
man of them was unable to support
me. I want to get a farm and make
my own living." She was allowed to
register.
The work of filing on the claims is
now going on in both the Lawton and
El IReno districts, and this will con
tinue for 60 days. Undoubtedly a large
portion of the 13.000 who draw puum
bers entitling them to file on claims
will not exercise their rights. While
those familiar with the country say
that most of the claims are good
enough for improvement by real bome
steaders, thare are thousands that are
not good enough to warrant a man giv
ing up position or business to move
thereon and make improvements. The
result wRi be that thousands drawing
claims especlally those with numbers
higher thas 4006, will aot dle on their

claims. A considerable t utihnr of tilts'
imumigrants have iractically nothitg
with which to make improvements or
to live on while waiting for the crotts
to grow on land that is flow merely
*od. On the poorer farms they will
give up the struggle to those hotter pre
pared or those who can lease indian or
school land in connection with their
own claims in order to have room for
stock.
Oklahoma and the Indian Territory
get fully one-thirdl of the clain'9
owing to the unanimity with which the
eligible portion of the population regis
tered.
Many changes will take place before
the reservation becomes a settled coun
try. In the first place it is all west of the ,
meridian of Wichita. Buflalo grass is
common over much of it, and buffalo
grass country Is not generally good
farming country. It can he farmed on
the creek bottoms and the uplands
used for pasture and bay. With plenty
of rain, of course, all can be farmed.
but rain is not always plentiful. The
Indlians will rent their land at 10 to 5O
cents an acre and spend the money.
Ihe whites will virtually use the en
tire reservation, and when once the
population has adapted itself to the
climatic conditions it will prosper.
There will be not a little hardship and
distress, but that is always a contin
gent in pioneer experience, though in
the end the Kiowa and Comanche
reservations will be transformed Into
fruitful farms and happy homes.
Thousands who came here with the
speculative idea that they were going
to strike it rich and mnake a big stake
have "folded their tents. like the Arahb.
and silently stolen away." There are
still here. however. people enough to
constitute a pretty goodl sized city. and
doubtless many of them will remain.
There is a population of 10.00() or
12(.00' here and. considering its varied
an(l unique character and primitive and
unorganized conditions of society. fair
ly gootld order has prevailed. Of course
there are salouns. gamblinr houses anl;"
all sorts of vice here. That is to ibe
expected in a frontier town,. andl this
Is certainly a typical frontier comn
munity. The wonder is how thousands
of people from all parts of the IUnited
States, east and west. north and
south. rich and poor andl high and low.
all thrown together in one conglotuera
tion without any laws or city oficials
could have maintained any semblance
of law and order. It Is true the United
States marshals had a large force of
members here, but they have made
only a very few arrests, and these
were bootleggers and violators of long
standing and bad reputations. Munici
pal government is now. however. fair
ly organized, and I look to see Lawton
dev lop into a staid, orderly and pros
perous city.
Two newspapers have already put
up their presses and are doing job
work, and one enterprising sheet, the
HOME BEEKEXS OUTFrIT.
Lawton Republican, has been issuing
an evening daily for some time. Al
though Lawton is 23 miles from the
nearest railroadl point and the freight
ers' rates are high, provisions and the
necessities of life are very reasonable.
Any one can get a good meal for 23
cents ,and other things in proportion.
Altogether the government land allot
ment, which drew to this section some
thing like 200U,000 people. in which
there were a considerable number of
the adventurous, the lawless and the
disreputable, has been conducted
squarely, and its results, when the ex
dtement has died out, will be bene
ficial to the territory. As the territory
becomes settled the demand for state
hood increases. There are few more
orderly communities In the United
States than Oklahoma as a whole, and

The men who fu nd him starr.4 b.atc k
with him by way of Doxter. New, of
his capture seemed to be borne to the,
wind, for the three menh became a dluzenu
then a score, then a hun tred--anl whets
they crossed the river a was a big, ruwti
mob.
It was the intention to bring the pris
oner to Whiteshoro, but, the mooh heard
that a body of officers had startel to ine
tercept them. Knowing that a fight
would be inevitable-for the mob wwer
deterniined on its vengeance-st weav
deemed prudent to destroy the murdscer
at once and with as little formality a
possible.
He was tied to a tree with chains and.
wires. Faggots and dry leavers were
Leaped about his body, sufficient to ig
nite his flesh, and then the natch wa
applied.
The story of the lynching is tmlit b
Constable Davaolpvrt as follows:
"Myself and M. W. Witt arrested Abe'
Wildner on Mud Creek today a:
little before noon. We arrested himisa
a corn field, and afterward a mob of as
hundred men gathered and forced as-t>
take the man out of the field. I told
them I wanted to know whether or not,
the man under arrest was guilty.
"I warned him that anythiang- hi
should tell might be use' against him a
as evidence, and asked him if he was
guilty. He told me the story as fol!
Itws: 'I murdered Mrs. Ijdwell- ITl
laid in wait until her hnuband left home,
and went to the house. I tried to as
a sault her and she was too strong for ma,
and I cut her throat. I went tharo fqr
the purpose of assaulting her."
"'That was all the unegro wI oa say,
except to confess to other mischief that
he had done in Whitesh,ror. He wasw
very stoical, and when the mob told hinm,.
they were going to burn hin. he unid '
nothing. There was some talk of lynch
ing in the Territory, but I got i , pris
oner in a wagon and s:arted for T-txaM
with him.
* After we crossed Red rrer and gro
acro-s to Grayson county line the cit)
zens' poise Over)lr;oere niu, ni I the
Otner utlicers ant took the pris.. r frorsr
us and burned hin."
Governor Sayers ordered on th istate
troops to protect the negro, but ie was
burned before the scene could tbs
reached.
