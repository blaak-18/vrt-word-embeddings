'onldeinsed Apple Culture.
Pr'of. Beal, of the Michigan Agri.
Ciliturel College, gives tile followiig
al niable tdileetiois f'or tapple grow
ing: A young tree should be treatedi
very imuch is you would treat a hill
of corn. lhed crotps will answer in
a young orehllard; sowed crops will
do nuch harmt to young trees. I
thitk it a good plan to keep young
trees tnclihed, and I am not sure but
it is the best of all ways to tecat large
or old trees as long as they live.
Maulch prevents the rapid evapratitn
of moisture from the soil, keeps the
surface mellow, prevents the soil
fi'onm often freezing and thawing in
winter and becouting overheated in
sulumer. Wvllether or not to culti
vate trees which have become well
estabilished depends upon circumstau
ces. I have never seen an apple or
chard which I tholight was injured by
too frequent shallow culture, but this
may be the case in some places, es
pecially in warm climates or where
the soil is deepand very rich. Wheth
or to cultivate or not can be told by
the looks of the tiecs. If the color
of the leaves is good the growth al1
right, and the trees bear well of fine
fruit, they are doing well enough,
even if in the grass. But if the leuves
are plsle, the growth of the annual
twigs much less than a foot it length
on trees set twelv's years, and the
fr'it small and poor, something is the
matter, and they are suflfering for
want of llow, harrow or cultivator,
or a heavy mulch or coat of manure,
or two or wore tif thleos combined.
'l'he upper twigs if tIree's se t tu n l
r y.caI's itilght to groi w six t o t 'lve or'
f muore inches eaclh ncar. To j nlge of
the cadlition ofl app. l leie is much
like judgintg of Ith co ldition oif sheet,
