KLAN IS NOT PARTISAN IN POLITICS; SEEKS
ONLY GREATEST INTEREST OF ALL AMERICANS
You no doubt have noticed through
the press the propaganda that is be
ing Droadly disseminated throughout
the country that the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan is engaged in a con
spiracy to get control of the local,
state and national government. This
is but the beginning of propaganda
that is to be nation-wide, and is in
tended to put the Klan in a whole in
the matter of political affairs, and
because of this fact, it is necessary
that our position be definitely stated
and understood. As American citi
zens we are interested in matters per
taining to our government above ev
erything else, and every real Klans
man must appreciate the value and
worth of citizenship with all that it
stands for, and for what it means, not
only to himself, but to his children
after him.
This is a “Government of the peo
ple, by the people and for the people”
and to that end we desire serious con
sideration and action on the part of
every real American. The organiza
tion is not partisan in any sense of
tthe word. It is made up of men of
different political faiths, but, as
American citizens and members of
this great organization, we have a
right to demand of our political par
ties absolute loyalty and inteerst to
American principles and ideals, and
we have a duty to see that political
parties enunciate in their platforms
those principles so clearly and defi
nitely that they can be understood
by all; and to that end we should be
constantly vigilant and active in par
ticipating in the conventions of the
several political parties. We should
see to it that principles embodied in
resolutions should find expression in
political platforms, so that when they
are enacted into the laws of our state
and nation they will adhere to the
benefit and welfare of our people in
the maintenance of Americanism.
We are not interested in the suc
cess of any particular party or indi
vidual, but we are deeply interested
in the making of just laws and in the
selection of men of such type and
character as will give us a -guaranty
Conferees ou the soldier bonus bill

Bishop Brent, of the Episcopal
church, Walker D. Hines, George W.

States to the League of Nations.

i heir liquor.”

passed over by the conferees
The Military Affairs committee re

THE FIERY CROSS
of the enforcement of the same in
the interest of good citizenship.
Therefore, it is altogether fitting
that those men who are affiliated
with the Republican party and the
Democratic party, or any other par
ty, are of the type and character that
can be depended upon to do their
whole duty without fear or favor.
Therefore, we must give attention to
the primaries and conventions to the
end that we may have men to select
from as our officers who will meas
ure up to the highest standards of
efficiency.
There are certain elements that we
have a right to expect to find in those
men whom we select for service.
Ist. They shall be clean men in
their lives and habits.
2nd. They shall be honest and de
pendable.
3rd. They shall be capable.
4th. They must have a knowledge
of the motives and purposes of our
government.
sth. They must know how to ap
ply the principles of Americanism to
the problems of America.
6tn. They must have a thorough
understanding of the responsibilities
and obligations of the office which
they aspire to hold.
7th. They shall be loyal to the
great fundamental principles of our
government, our ideals and institu
tions, and this loyalty shall be abso
lutely beyond question.
If American citizens will give prop
er attention to the above suggestions,
we will have no reason to regret the
outcome at the polls.
The matter of government is the
most important thing that touches
our lives as citizens, and if we are
negligent, we cannot expect the best
from governmental administration.
As Klansmen, we have rights, duties,
and obligations, and no real Klans
man can afford to be indifferent or
recreant to political affairs in his lo
cal community, state or nation. We
have no desire to dictate political
preferment when it comes to the mat
ter of political party; neither would
we have our members dissociate them-
to acquire all the helium gas bearing
fields in the country.

Before the committee investigating
the facts connected with the indict
ment of Senator Wheeler, Montana,
witnesses who investigated allegations
submitted to the grand Jury aaid
Wheeler had promised be would
handle land grants before tbs depart
ment, but Commissioner Hpry, of the
land office, testified the files did not
selves from the political parties of
their choice to the extent that they
become non-partisan, as this would
make impossible participation in
those affairs that are of supreme in
terest to us; on the other hand we
would have every Klansman to be so
jealous of his party that he would not
suffer it to be used in any way against
the highest interest and greatest good
of his country, and we would have
him so determined that he would see
to it that men of the proper type and
character are the standard bearers of
his party. When these two elements
do not obtain in his party, a Klans
man should possess that hardiness of
manhood and sturdy devotion to
Americanism that he would not hesi
tate one moment in casting his bal
lot in the interest of those ideals
which we believe and for which we
stand.
Under our present form of govern
ment, political parties are virtually
a necessity, but they are only instru
ments to be used by the people of
our nation as means of service, and
as American citizens, we are inter
ested in seeing that that service is
rendered and the common good ob
tained.
It is not to early for us to begin
scanning the political horizon. In
fact, we should make a survey of the
situation and constantly bear in mind
the type and character of men that
we are going to call into service. We
want and must have men who can put
the common good above self and self
ish interests, and who will put the
common welfare of our people above
the mere matter of party success. If
we have and maintain this idea and
adhere to it as our ideal, we will ren
der a great service for all the people
of our great country.
