thority to hire as many nurses as
might be necessary for the fever pa

every one here would have the fever
who had not had it before. The Sur

him: "Hire as many nurses as you
may need and any assistance this of
Iee can give you is at your disposal."

INCIURABLES RESTORED.-Do notl
despair because your physician th:ak ees
his head. Professional opinions are
not infallible; and they are never
wider of the mark than when they
pronounce Chronic Dispepsia an in
curable malady. To mitigate its
pangs, the faculty usually prescribe
air, exercise, and lrandy. The first
two are God's medicines; tile last is
a satanic poison. The only medicine
needed in Dyspepsia and its concomri
tants is Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters, the great vegetable
tonic of the age. july.
Grant is at Long Branch, and the
country is sloshing along without his
help.
Kellogg, so says the New Orleans
Times ,will in a few days issue a pro
clamation calling upon all good citi
zens of all parties to forl a posse comn
-nitatus to aid the officers of the law,
in Grant and other parishes, to pre
serve tie law. Better far, appoint
officials who can execute the law than
in thus attempting to saddle a corm
munity with their official shortconl
mings.

WEEKLY AND DAILY FOR 1875
The approach of the Presidential elec
tion gives unusual importances to the
events and developlments of IS75. We
shall endeavor to describe them fully,
faithfiully, and fearlessly.
TIlE WEEKLY SUN has now attain
ed a circulation of over seventy thon
saund lcolies. Its readers are ftound ill
every State and Territo,ry, ant: its (jalli
t.y is well known to the public. We
lshall not only endeavor to keep it fully
up to the old standard, but to improve
and add to its variety and phwer.
THE WEEKLY SUN will continue to
be a thorough newspaper. All the news
of the day will hl foºund in it, condetns
ed when unimlortnut, at full length
when of omenlcet, and always, we trust,
treated in a clear, interesting and in
structive mllnler.
It is oar siln to imake the Weekly Sun
the best famiily newspaper in the worl.
It will he till of eintertaining and ap
propriate reading of every sort, but will
"riult nothing to offend the most scrupn
lons and delicate taste. It will always
contain the niost interestin. stories and
romances of the day, carefully selected
and legibly printed.
The Agricultural Department is a
prominent feature in the Weekly Sun,
und its articles will always be found
fresh and useful to the farnmer.
The number of men independent in
poiitics is increasing, and the Weekly
Sun is their paper especially. It belongs
to no party, and obeys no dictation, con
teuding fur principle, and for the election
of the best Ilmenl. It exposes the corrup
tion that disgraces the country and
threatens the overthrow of republican
institutions. It has no fear of knaves,
and seeks no favors from their support
ers.
The markots of every kind and the
fashions are regularly reported in its
col umns.
The price of the WEEKLY SUN is one
dollar a year for a sheet of eight pages,
and lifty-six columns. As this barely
pays expenses of paper and printing, we
are not able to make any discount or al
low any premium to friends who may
make special elieorts to extend its circula
tion. Under the newt laws which re
quires payment of postage in advance,
one dollar a year, with twenty cents the
cost of prepaid postate added, is the rate
of subscription. It is not necessarytto
get up a club in order to have the Week
ly Sun at this rate. Any one who sends
one dollar and twenty cents will get the
paper, post-paid, for a year.
* We have no traveling agents.
THE WEEKLY SUN.-Eight pages,
fifty-six columns. Only $1.20 a iyear,
postage prepaid. ' No discount from this
rule.

Pcople's Vindicator,
FOR 1875.1
We take pleasure in announcing to the
numerous friends of the VINDICTOII,
that we have perfected arrangements for
the continuation of its publication upon
a firm basis. The public are well aware
.of the dillienlties under whiich the Con
servative press ot Louisiana labor;. the
infamous printing law pased by a parti
san Legislature, solely to foster and up
hold, at thile expense of the tax-pa,yers,
journals entirely antagonistiecal to their
interest, and at war upon their liberties,
:and by forcing, under the forms of law,
our cititzens to advertise in these official
papers,' to break down their Ipower, the
Conservative and Democratic press; con
scquently we are comipelled to depend
for support upon the generous contribu
tion of a people already poverty-stricken,
but we feel assured that they wll not
fail to sustain their main power in the
war of virtue against vice
The Fearless White Ian's Press of
lonisiana.
The future tone of this paper can be
judged from its past. We will continue
to advocate to success, the rights of the
TAXED. that honesty and capability,
ALONE, shall constitute grounds for po
litical preferment, and a conltinued and
never ceasing war upon Kellogg and his
corrupt official--knowing themi to be in
comnmon with their Chief, both usurpers
and thieves.
We can assure the public that we will
not hesitate to attack the acsets of any po
litical organizafion, when we believe
them to be antagonistic to public good.
We are the servant of no clique or party,
and intend solely to protect and defend
the rights and liberties, in our honest
way, of the whole people-believing that
we have done sufficient service in the
cause of the PEOPLE in the past, we
confidently expect their support in the
future.

A IRepresentative and Champion of American
Art Taste !
Frospctins for ISh--Eiglhtl Year.
TIHE ART JOURNAL OF AMERICA,
ISSUE!)D 1MOXTIILY.
"A. Magnificent Conception, wonderfully
carried oult."
The el essity of at populai:r mndimn for
the Ieprienltation (If 1, l pro lIloductions of
our great artists, 1h1s alw ays been rccog.
,ized, and many attempts have been
initati; to meret the want. The suc.cessive
failures which so invaril.y followed e.'lh
attempt in this coulntry to establish an
art journal, (lid not prove the inditlTr
ence of the people of America to the
claims of high art. So soon as a proper
appreciation of the want and aul ability
to meet it were shown, the public at
once rallied with enthusiasm to its sup
port. and the result was a great irlistiec
and commercial triumph--Tll E AIDINE.
THE ALDINE, while issued with all the
regularity. has none of the temporary or
timely interest characteristic of ordinary
peri dicals. It is anll elegant miscellany
of pure, light and graceful literature; and
a collection of pictures, the rarest speci
meuns of artistic skill, in black and white.
Although eacnh succeeding numnter affords
a fresh plalsure to its friends, the real
value and be:uty of the AI.I)In will be
most appreciated after it ;has been hound
up at the close of the year. White other
journals mlav clainm superior cheapness, as
compared with rrrals of a, similar class,
the AI,DINE is a unique and original con
eeption--alone and iunapproached-abso
lutely without competition in price or
charaeter. The pIosse.ssor of a complete
volune cannot duplicate the quantity of
fine paper and8l engravings in any other
shape or number of volumes for ten times
its cost ; and then, there is the Chronm
besides!
National featurenof1 THE ALDINE
must be taken in no narrow sense. True
art is cosmopolitan. While THE AL
DINE is a strictly American institution,
it does not contine itself entirely to the
reproduction of native art. Its missin;,
is to cultivate a brouad and] appreciative
art taste, one that will discriminate ontly
on grounds of intrinsic merit. 'Thus,
while placing before the patrons of THE
ALDINE. as a leading ehaeracneritie, the
productions of the most note.d American
artists, attention will 'lwa ys he riven to
specimens fron foreign ma:ster@, giving
subscribers all the pleasure and instrue
tion obtainabie from home or foreign
Sources.
The artistic illustration of American
scenery, original with THE ALDINE, is
an important feature, and its magnificent
plates are of a size more appropriate to
the satisfactory treatment of details
tithan can be afforded by any inferior
page. The judicious interspersion of
landscape, marine, figure, and animal
subjects, sustain an unabated interest,
impossible where the scope of the work
confines the artist too closely to a single
style of sulbject. The literature of THE
ALPINE is a light and graceful accom
paniment, worthy of the artistic fea
tures, with only sunch technical disqrisi
tions as do not interfere with the popu
lar interest of the work.
Presniaun for 1875.
Every subscriber for 1875 will receive
a beautiful portrait, in oil colors, of the
same noble dog whose picture in a for
mer issue attracted so much attention,
"MA ~'S UNSELFISII FRIEND"

rybody loves such a dog, and the portrait
is executed so trite to the life, that it
seems the veritable presence of the ani
mal itself. The Rev. T: De Witt Tal
mage tells that his own Newfoundland
dog (the finest in Brooklyn, barks at it!
Althotgh so natural, no onel who sees

The Oldest and Best Story Paper Pub
h lished.
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Poet has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever borne a
widespread antd unblemishee reputation
for the unsurpassed purity, refinement
and excellence of the Serials, Sketches
and Miscollaneollus reading matter.
It is pre-eminently
The Best Family Paper 1
that is published in this country, from its C
never containing anything that would
otffend the feelings of any one, either in
a religious or political sense, or that
could no t he rand at any fireside without
objection from the meeot fastidiops.
The circulation of the Saturday Even
ing Post., through not quite so large
perhaps, as its younger eontemporaries,
is not, like that of some of them, fluctu
ating, and too often short-lived, but
UnBE, 80LID AND SUBSTANTIAL,
based upon the intrinsic merit of the pa
per itself alnd not dependent on any ex
traneous influnences, such as the popllari
ty of individual writers, &c.
Good, however, as the Saturday Even.
ing Post has been in the past, it is our
intention to make it still better in tlhe
future, and with this object i view we
will effect a marked improvement in eve
ry department of the paper, land will
call to our assistance writers of adinitted
ability and known reputation,
By inereasing its former attractions,
and adding tmitany jldiciouI and pleas
ing novelties, by studying how to please
and cultivate the popular taste, by in
creasing industry and enterprise, and by
enlarged facilities, we hope to make new
friends with each and every issue, and
continue to maintain the claim of the
Saturday Evening Post to its title of TnH
OLDES.T AND T111 IIErT Of Family 8tory
