Each one of our speakers has been
supplied with tickets and will dis
tribute them to such men as apply at
every meeting. The electors in ev
erv District have tickets.
The Jeffersonian printed a legal
ticket last week, and does so again
this week, in the form of coupons
which may simply be cut out of the
paper and used.
The Executive Committee, at 708
Temple Court, Atlanta, will send
tickets to all who write or wire for
them. If they have sent you some,
but not enough, call for more. They
are sending them out in quantities ev
ery day.
We are taking every pains to in
sure every voter and worker tickets'.
Get them from any of the above
sources, go to the polls on election
day and stay there until your pre
cinct goes for “our Tom!”
TO OUR MANY FRIENDS—
GREETING.
We cordially invite each one of you
to visit our headquarters, at 709 Tem
ple Court, corner of Alabama and
Pryor streets —just one block from the
old deput. You will find congenial
spirits. Y r ou will hear the latest news
of the campaign. You can help the
workers here with suggestions; you
can carry home with you tickets and
literature that will promote the cause.
Don’t miss the chance of getting in
touch with the work in a vital and up
lifting way. Mr. Watson will drop in
whenever he can, and his lieutenants
will be on hand at all hours.
Say, with us, “Georgia for Wat
son!”
Yours to that end,
J. J. HOLLOWAY,
Chairman.
J. E. BODENHAMER,
Secretary.

The above is a real, genuine ticket. In every
respect legal and usable. All you need to do
is to cut it out and vote it at your regular poll
ing place.
In 1904 there were thousands of men who
could not vote because for some reason no tick
ets were to be had. This year no such condi
tion need exist. We take this method to abso
lutely insure that every subscriber of the Jef
fersonian can have a ticket in his vest pocket
if he finds none at the voting place. And for
the readers who are not subscribers —we want
to say, and to emphasize:
That we have thousands of tickets and a large
force of people sending them out. We want
each of you to ask for as many as you can use.
They will be sent, and at once.
The matter of having plenty of tickets on
hand, so that our principles may be vindicated
at the polls, is of the most tremendous impor
tance. We can not pay for “workers.” Our
party is not made up of mercenary hirelings.
But every manly man who reads this is asked,
for the sake of the cause of Truth and the
rights of his country, to do his part to get every
man he knows to vote with us on November 3d.
