PA.RIS[ OF VFERNsN,
August 26th, 1877.
Dear Vindicator :
The cotton of this section is complete
ly eaten up by the worms. The yield
cannot far exceed one third of a crop,
and it miighlt hayv. been saved by the
timely application of Paris Green. Mr.
San'l. Avard used the distroyer on his
cotton, and he intrmeld me the other
dlay that lie siiceded in thoroughly
erntlicating the worms, iand saved his
cotton.
"Big meetings" is the order of thle day
here; only two weeks ago there was a
live days tt .tin;,g at thle Anaroco Baptist
(huirch, anId another is now in tull blast
at the same pilne ; truly, two nmch of a

also being lectured on Temlti raince, 'ii nd
general morality, by the Rev. l)r. Hlar
nmon, of New Orleans, .weho is llling an
applointment mlade for last year. So
yon see Mr. Editor, the mloral man is not
likely to suflfer fir support in Vernui.

There has been an increase of sickness
since I wrote you last, still, however.
I conftined to the children, though as yet,
I hut little mortality has resulted.
A severe drouth is prevailing here, to
the injury of the potat)oe, race, and cane
crop. Hunting is all tile go now with
r those who have the tine to spare from
business. My friend Billy, the indefati
gable Clerk of the Court, has just re
Sturned from a weeks lhunt, inll which he
1 "thined em," '"fact, Sir," killed three, or
rather all of them but two. Billy is go
ing regularly into the business, has es
t tablished a line of hunting posts from
Leesville to the Sabino. D)eer are ve.y
fat. Mr. W. killed one the other day,
which hle says was three inchies (solid tt
B on the brisket. If he had only extracted
ithe bone from its tail, and inserted a:
Swick, I expect it would have made a
good candle.

PanE, Aux CLEns,
Sept. 4th, 1677.
J. IH, COSGROVE.
Dear Sir-On retarning home after an
absence of a few days, I findl that cotton
on which I put Par is Green two weeks
since, full of blooms, and showing very
little effect of the worms. which appear
ed in this cut first-adjoining it is a cut
entirely eat up, on which no poison was
Splaced. It is strange so great a variety
of opinion should exist regarding the
effect of paris green on cotton. In my
Sopinion it is harmless to the plant andl
deadly to the worm, when properly mixed
Sandl put on. In 1873, I killed cotton
j with it mixed according to the then
popular formula, since, I use flour
alone with tile poison, 25 to 30 pounds of
Flounr to one of Paris Green, andt I prefer
to put it on after the dew is off, so that
t it will scatter more generally and evenly
over the plant. I have no doubt of its
n efficacy thus used.
SMy crop is not greatly damaged, the
r larger portion is untonched, particularly
the back or stiff lands, but as we lhadl
Sseveral hours of hard rain this morning
and every appearance of more, I suppose
the wormswill develop everywhere.
As it is only hy exchanging opinions
and experiments we can hope to stay the
- ravages of this pest. I have written
- this in the hope that others will do like
wise. Yours, &c.,
F L.
