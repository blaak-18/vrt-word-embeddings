_ Budweiser's Lead $3,633,591
Further:
The sale of Budweiser exceeds that
of all other bottled beers combined
. . and it is therefore justly entitled
-.. to the term

AN INTERESTING COMPARISON.
It would naturally appear that owing
to the price for which imported cham
pagnes are sold, the combined revenue
for the sale of all these wines would be
in excess of the amount paid annually
for any single brand of bottled beer.
But such is not the case, as the United
States custom house statistics clearly and
definitely prove.
Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser not only
etceeds in sales all other bottled beers
combined, but has proved itself the
mightiest competitor of imported cham
pagnes by exceeding their annual reve
nue more than three and one-half gpillion
dollars.
The sales of Budweiser during the
year 0g9a were 83J90,3oo bottles, aver
aging 25 cents per bottle, amountiqg to
$2,4947,575.
The United States custom house re
cords prove the importation of all cham
pagnes fo rthe year Io0e tp be 36o,708
cases. Figuring on a basis of 12a quart
bottles per case--4,3r 6 bottles, and
if sold at the maximum, $4.oo per bottle,
to consumers amounted to $17,313.591.
From these figures it will be seen that
Budweiser's lead was $&633,591.
It is a noteworthy fact that this pure
and wholesome beverage is fast sup
planting imported champagnes upon the
banquet table, just as it is supplanting
the- decanter upon the sideboard in
American homes.
This is as it should be, and marks a
perceptible advancement in the direction
of true temperance.
Budweiser is a brew that is known the
;world aroud, and is not only prefefred
by discriminating customers because of
its rare flavor, fine effervescence and
perfect maturity, but prescribed by phy
sicians everywhere on account of its ab
solute purity, nourishing and-upbuilding
effects.
