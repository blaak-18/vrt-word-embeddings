The Farmers 3 Union and Duck
worth, Ladson and Bodenhamer
We are in receipt of a letter re
questing the publication of the fol
lowing:
“Resolved, by Wesley Local Union,
No. 76 (Taylor county, Georgia),
That we are unanimously opposed to
sending representatives to the meet
ings of any organization that will not
seat an actual farmer.
“Resolved further, That we ask
our officers, State and national, to
retain legal counsel only whose char
acter is beyond suspicion.
“Done in session October 16, 1909.
“W. L. COSEY, Pres.
“W. E. BAZEMORE, Sec’y.”
Ed. Comment: Mr. J. E. Boden
hamer himself told a member of The
Jeffersonian staff that he had been
elected, by the Birmingham conven
tion, a delegate to the convention of
Union Labor to be held at Toronto,
Canada. He made the statement
twice. It was reported to me, as
something that I ought to know.
My friends will remember that Mr.
Bodenhamer secured the election of
himself as Secretary and Treasurer
of the Populist State Executive Com
mittee for Georgia. They will also
recall that Mr. Bodenhamer, on his
own motion and without any author
ity from me or Chairman Holloway,
or any one else, went before the
Republican committee, of which the
national banker, R. J. Low r ry, is
chairman, and proposed some sort of
deal. Mr. Lowry, so it was said, de
manded his credentials, and of
course Bodenhamer could not pro
duce any. Mr. Bodenhamer had in
timated to me something of this sort
in my room at the Kimball, and I had
virtually put him and the Republi
can who accompanied him, out of
my room. The Republican—once
high in Populist ranks —remarked to
me, “You need not say a word. Just
sit here, and let me and Boden
hamer arrange it.”
I replied, “No! You and Boden
hamer can’t even discuss such a mat
ter in my presence.”
Then they left. Comparing inci
dents and dates, when the papers got
hold of Bodenhamer’s visit to the
Republican committee, it became
clear to my mind that his purpose in
coming to me was to get the creden
tials which Lowry had demanded,
and which would have opened Bo
denhamer’s way to the Republican
campaign funds.
The Atlanta Journal got the story
from Grier; discovered also that I
had spent the same night at the
Kimball; and they began that cow
ardly and villainous series of edi
torials in which they accused me of
being a party to what Bodenhamer
had done.
A fouler slander was never invent
ed. I was paying my own campaign
expenses, mainly out of my own
pocket, getting comparatively little
aid from any source.
Bodenhamer’s attempt on the Re
publican funds did me an immense
amount of harm, for people were so
excited that thousands of men who
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
ought to have known better, were de
ceived by Hoke’s organ’s lies.
Bodenhamer himself published a
full statement taking all the blame
on himself, and exonerating me, but
it could not undo the harm that had
already been done. I lost thousands
of votes by it.
At that time he was publishing
my Magazine; but he grew very an
gry because of my refusal to pay for
a lot .of them which he could not
show were ever delivered. He had
agreed to take a receipt for all copies,
as they were delivered; and our At
lanta office was under instructions to
give such receipts. The lady man
ager declared that she had invaria
bly given the receipts, and that the
numbers in dispute had never been
in our office. As Bodenhamer could
not produce the receipt, nor offer a
bit of evidence to sustain his claim,
I declined payment. Therefore, when
he got the management of Duck
worth’s paper, he had it in for me.
(1) Because I refused to give him
the paper that Mr. Lowry required.
(2) Because I had refused to pay
for those alleged Magazines.
Duckworth and I had been on
friendly terms —almost as long as he
had been in Georgia. His paper and
mine had also been friendly.
Bodenhamer changed this. He
gave other papers better clubbing
terms than he gave The Jefferson
ian. He refused to give us the News
at less than seventy-five cents, al
though he clubs it with other papers
at fifty cents and sixty-five cents. In
other words, he shut me out with a
prohibitive rate.
Not content with that, he repub
lished —or Duckworth did —on the
editorial page of the News, an attack
made on me by the Augusta Herald,
in connection with the Sully ware
house plan. In this attack, the facts
were not correctly stated, and Duck
worth knew it.
Duckworth knew very well that
Charley Barrett had come down here,
to my house, to see me in reference
to the Sully plan and to ask me to
go to Atlanta to have an interview
with Sully. I did not know Sully; had
never even seen him. Going to Atlan
ta next day, Charley came for me at
the Kimball, took me to Sully’s room
fn the Piedmont, and I was present
throughout the interview. At its ter
mination, we both told Sully that his
plan, if it was what he claimed it to
be, would be of vast benefit to the
cotton-growers. Sully requested me
to put such an opinion in writing,
and I did so.
Almost any other man would have
“gone for” Duckworth about the un
derhanded way in which he used
against me an editorial attack that
another paper had made, and which,
as he knew, did me an injustice.
If Charley Barrett had not asked
me to do it, I would not have gone
to Atlanta to see Sully. And the
very same opinion that I had put in
15b*
writing, Charley had expressed ver
bally.
Although greatly provoked at the
manner in which this gentleman,
who had so recently become a citi
zen of Georgia, had so flagrantly
gone out of his way to assail me, I
remained silent. For fear that the
Farmers’ Union might be hurt by a
fuss over the matter, I swallowed an
injury which was personal to myself
alone.
But when Bodenhamer stated twice
that he was to be the official repre
sentative of the farmers at a labor
union convention; and when Duck
worth, who denounces the ship-sub
sidy thieves in his paper, went over
to his native State, and in the Gal
veston Farmers’ Union Convention,
made “an enthusiastic speech” in fa
vor of those artfully worded ship
subsidy resolutions, the camel’s back
broke.
So long as it was merely a ques
tion of boycotting The Jeffersonian
and republishing an unjust attack on
me, I could, for the sake of the
Farmers’ Union, keep silent. But
when the crookedness of Bodenham
er and Duckworth threatened damage
to all the farmers, and the betrayal
and ruin of the Union —I felt that
to remain silent longer would be un
just to the farmers themselves.
A man who acted as Bodenhamer
did in the campaign last year, is too
dangerous. He acts on the sly, pur
sues secret aims of his own, and
gravely compromises those with
whom he is officially connected.
It was the smooth-tongued Boden
hamer who persuaded Charley Bar
rett to name C. T. Ladson “General
Counsel of the Farmers’ Union.” (See
Ladson’s professional ad. in the Union
News of October 20, 1909, page 10.)
He gets the benefit of the valuable
endorsement of the great Farmers’
Union. To select him as official at
torney of all the splendid men who
compose the Union, is the same as
giving him a certificate of good
character.
He is not the man whose official
connection with the Farmers’ Union
can do it any good.
He lured certain officials in the
Neal Bank, of Atlanta, into the dis
tant fields of Cuban speculation. He
knew that he was doing wrong, and
seducing officials to betray a trust.
He was bound to know that the spec
ulation might be a failure;that the
bank might be wrecked, and thou
sands of innocent men, women and
children beggared.
It happened that way. The specu
lation did not pan out as expected.
The bank failed. And nine thousand
troubled faces were seen that morn
ing, gazing dolefully on the doors of
she gutted bank.
Is it not a shocking thing to mis
appropriate trust funds? The law
so considers it. Is not the tempter
as bad at heart as his victim? We
think so. M'any a home, in Atlanta
and elsewhere, was filled with gloom
and distress because of the wrecking
of that Neal Bank. Many a poor man
and poor woman suffered during the
two winters since their little all was
swept away. There’s no telling how
much misery Ladson and his con-
federates brought upon those nine
thousand depositors.
Can the farmers of the country
give a certificate of good character to
a lawyer like that? I did not think
so; and when I saw that he had been
chosen “General Counsel” of the
Farmers’ Union, I wrote to Duck
worth a strong protest. He was
State president at that time. He an
swered, curtly, that the Neal Bank
transaction “had been explained.”
How can a thing like that be “ex
plained?” How could Ladson “ex
plain” away the facts? I have pub
lished them time after time, and he
enters no denial. Nor will he make
any denial, for he can’t.
If the National Farmers’ Union
has need of a “General Counsel,”
don’t you think you are entitled to
have one whose recent record is not
so bad?
I am glad to see the resolutions
which precede these comments, and
hope that every lodge, South and
West, will take the matter up. Very
earnestly and repeatedly have my
best efforts been employed to get
these things straightened out without
any publicity. But having utterly fail
ed, I am now laying the full story be
fore the people. I can not bear to
see the Farmers’ Union made the
dupe and cat’s-paw of a small coterie
of designing men. Charley Barrett
is pure gold, but he has much to con
tend with; has to be on the go most
of the time, and has been naturally
reluctant to believe that he is being
betrayed by men who possess his
confidence. It is for the good of the
Farmers’ Union, and to aid Barrett
in keeping things going right, that
I am exposing certain men.
You don’t want any official rela
tions with bank-wreckers; nor with
men who almost ruin their candi
dates by attempts to get Republican
money; nor with men who in Texas
advocate a measure which in Georgia
they classify, properly, as a steal.
Speak out in your locals, and don’t
rest satisfied until your wishes have
been respected.
THE HONESTY OF TAFT.
Dear Sir:—ln your editorial in the
issue of The Jeffersonian of October
14, “Your President”, you say: “Mr.
Taft is a good-natured, honest, com
panionable man.” Do you really and
truly, honest Injun, consider Mr. Taft
honest? Your editorial in the same
issue of The Jeffersonian, “Trying to
Pacify the West” would seem to a
man “up a tree” to qualify his hon
esty by extracting its qualities, and
had you said “Mr. Taft is a good
natured, dishonest, companionable
man” your sentiments would have
been nearer expressed.
Truly,
J. P. TAYLOR.

Answer.
What I meant was, that I did not
believe our Presidential handshaker
and professional soft-soaper would
steal.
As to politics, I would not trust
L att any further than I could sling
an elephant by the tail. He’s a poli
tician, all right, and is as tricky as
they make ’em. He even fooled Ted
dy; and Teddy himself is as slippery
as a dozen eels.
If the truth were known about the
