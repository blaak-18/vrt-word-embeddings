not been removed. In this ease the
connection is definitely established and
the disease and cause are well known.
Then improperly cured wheat gives
rise to a disease known as acrodyma,
while kakke, or beri-beri, comes from
lating bad rice.
So improperly cured corn produces
pellagra. The condition of the grain,
it appears, becomes favorable to the
culture of germs, or possibly yeasts or
moulds, the product of which is a poi
son that accumulates in the system
and causes the disease.
Pellagra and like diseases, Dr. Har
ris states, are found, as a rule, among
the poorer classes, whose bodies, of
ten insufficiently nourished, are more
susceptible. Some physicians who
have investigated the subject, hold
that, once the disease has got a start
jrom eating bad corn, is may be ag
gravated by eating perfectly good
corn, or corn meal in which it is
stated, there is a small percentage of
rhe poison responsible for it.
It may occur, however, and has not
infrequently been found in persons
in better circumstances in life, and a
very remarkable fact in connection
with it is that instances have oc
curred, both in the acute and chronic
forms, where the patients could not
recall having eaten corn or corn meal
at all, and sometimes stated positively
they had not done so.
It is apparent, therefore, that pel
lagra is one of the interesting and im
portant problems toward a solution of
which the medical profession must
work.
No way of detecting the poisonous
substances formed in the grain which
gives rise to the disease has yet been
discovered, although the connection
between the eating of bad corn and the
disease seems to have been established
beyond all question. But there is no
known test which can be applied to a
sack of corn meal, for instance, which
will determine whether or not the eat
ing of it will cause pellagra. In fact,
where the poison is present it might,
cause the disease in one person and
not in another who might be better
prepared physically to resist it.
Wilh a view to the prevention of
the disease in so far as is possible,
the Italian government, in whose do
main it has been most prevalent, has
issued certain instructions with regard
to the harvesting and curing of corn,
which, it is believed, have had good
effect in’prevention. Co-n should not
be gathered until it is thoroughly ripe,
and it should be housed and sheltered
so as to be kept perfectly dry, as
moisture may set up the fermentation
necessary to the production of the
disease.
Since pellagra has undobutedly
made its appearance in Georgia, Ala
bama and other Southern States, and
numerous deaths have already result
ed from what appears to be the acute
form of it, medical officials and boards
of health feel that the public should
become as thoroughly informed re
garding it as is possible under present
circumstances.
Atlanta has had a number of deaths
recently from this disease, and there
are records of many deaths from the
acute form in the insane asylums of
this and neighboring States.—Atlanta,

GOOD READING. ,
The Jeffersonian is pleased to note
two bright new publications among
the host of more familiar on the ex
change list. These are:
‘‘The Common Herd,” of Dallas,
Texas. According to a reply therein
answering a query as to what per
sons are interested in the magazine,
it appears that the promoter, pub
lisher, editor, proprietor, treasurer,
secretary, genera! manager, grand
mogul and WHOLE CHEESE is
Richard Potts. This being the case,
all elements concerned should har
monize beautifully and evidently
they do, for the May number is ex
ceptionally well written, well printed
and attractive. We are ever glad
to extend the hand of good fellow
ship to the independent editor. Mr.
Potts has an excellent editorial upon
government ownership this time, and
hints that he has in store for his
readers a brand-new solution of the
liquor question.
“Fuss” is another sheet lately es
tablished and published “whenever
the moon is right, provided the
ground is not too wet nor too dry.
and the wind is from the other di
rection and the baby is asleep, and
the “Dear Widow” is gone from
home,’ by our loyal old Populist
friend, R. E. Thompson, of Toom
suba, Miss. “Fuss” is all right; it
is quarrelling at conditions, and in
justices, and silliness, but attacking
such things from a standpoint of
common sense and reason, not vitu
peration or petty personality.
FISHERMAN’S LUCK.
There was once a comedian who
went out with a fishing party, and be
gan to suffer from thirst. One of the
crowd took pity on the sufferer and
fastened a bottle of beer to his fishing
line while he was on a voyage of ex
ploration.
When the actor returned he found
his line heavy, and started to haul in
what he thought was the biggest fish
of the day.
Gleeful over his changed luck, he
shouted to the captain:
“Hey, captain, this is the place.
Anchor right herec we’re sailing over
a brewery.”—Tit-Bits.
EUREKA FISH NET.
Eureka Fish Nets are a new pa
tented article made of galvanized
steel wire, and will last from twelve
to eighteen months.
They catch all varieties of fish that
inhabit our rivers, creeks, and ponds.
The fish go into them at times until
they are in a perfect jam. They are
<he finest things in the world for eels,
and will soon clear a stream of that
menace to gill-net fishermen, the musk
rat.
They only require being baited with
few pieces of corn bread and dropped
into the water. Full printed direc
tions are sent with each net for the
benefit of persons who have no expe
rience in this way of fishing.
They are very easily handled, only
weighing three or four pounds, and
can be used by any one and without a
boat.
See their advertisements in this is
sue and write to Eureka Fish Net Co.,
Box 1, Griffin, Ga., or Box 1, Dallas,
Texas, for booklet of price ffiid testi
monials.

The Anti Usury League publishes a
book dealing with the injustice of in
terest. The book is called “Usury”. It
contains 300 pages, is neatly bound in
cloth, and is sent prepaid for one dol
lar. This book knocks the from
indev the national banks /U shows
their infamous origin, their grip and
their danger to the republic. It shows
the remedy for the social and industrial
evils which unpractical reformers are
seeking. It is not pessimistic, though
it treats of oppressive injustices; but
is emphatically hopeful of the complete
victory over giant wrongs when the
new-old remedy here advocated is ap
plied. Whether you be a Christian or
a pagan, write for it today. It will
make you a wiser citizen; it will give
you a higher conception of what true,
noble manhood should be. It will give
you a higher ideal for your own life,
and of the fraternal relations that
should prevail among men.
