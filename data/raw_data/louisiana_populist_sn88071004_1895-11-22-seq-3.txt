The many friends of Mr. P. F.
Bouis, will regret to learn of his
death on Sunday evening, Novemi
ber 17th. i
Mr. IBouis had been ill for sometl
months, having resigned his posi- h
tion with Meesrs. Ducourneau &
Son with whom he had been asso- s
ciated for thirty years.
Deceased espoused the Confede I
rate cause in '61, and serving until
discharged, returned to business in
Natchitoches.
A large concourse of friends
and sorrowing relatives sttended
the funeral at 4 o'clock Monday "
evening from the C.thedral to the
Catholic cemetery. We extend
our sympathy to the bereaved fam
ily.

The stone walk in front of the gate t
is smooth and durable, and should

From the Catholic Cathedral a
large following of friends and rel
atives attended the interment in
the Catholic cemetery. To his sor
rowing brother and sisti r. we ex
tend our he:rtfelt sympathy. May
he rest in ipeace.
The Single Tax meeting took
place Monday night, and was at
tended by about fifty persons. The
r speeches were well delivered, and
one and all showed that the efforts
I of the orators were aplreciated.
- We hope that a large meeting will
I soon take place, for nothing awa
kens the sluggish channels of
- thought like a Single Tax argu
mient. If you do not understand
the Smngle Tax, come to tihe next
meeting with your (juestions.
On Tuesday, Nov. l9th, there
l.assed away one of the iLst known
residents of Natchitoches, Mr.
George I)elmas.
l)eceased was a native of France,
but for a numbler of years lived t
among us, he being the leading
ba:ker of this city.
His resting place is in the Cath
olic cemetery, where he was inter- e
red with Pythian honor, he hal - f
ing been a nmember of Lodge No. c

Many friends attended the last
sad rites over the lifeless clay of '
one of Natchitoches best citizens. t
His family has our sympathy in i
their sad loss.
Our genial friend P. L. Pru- 3

Mixed Primaries. c
If a DIemocratic paper has the t
following to say about a Democrat
ic primary election what can they
expect the Populist papers to say :
The sale of votes was confined t
to the brother in black.
Whiskey played an important [
part in the election yesterday. .
The colored brother was more C
in demand yesterday than usual.
It was an open field and a fair d
fight, but it was disgusting to the a
voters who cast an intelligent bal- i
lot.
Some of our dusky citizens have a
mnade more money out of politics i
this year than their cotton crop a
brought them. I
There are more ward heelers
and political bums in DeSoto than
was ever known in the dark days
of reconstruction.
How long can white supremacy
be maintained where the negro a
Republican leaders are as promi- 9
nent at the polls as they were yes
terdayt r
The election was "mixed" in r
every sense of the word. Shall e
we ever have another like it? Can't t
nominations be made in a more de- a
cent wayi i
Be it said to their credit, the c
better element of the colored peo
ple denounced the conduct of the
illiterate and irresponsible of their
race whose votes were for sale yes
terday, and the denanciation is not
confined to the preachers either.
A great deal of distust was
manifested by the white Democrats,
many of whom vowed they would c
never participate in another mixed c
primary. We have heard this sort r
of talk before, and have noticed a
that the mandates of the execu- ,
tire committee are always obeyed. ,
Bepublican negroes were not even c
challenged. All the negroes voted c
that were of age and wanted to t
vote. Several Populists also vo
ted, but one of the most promi
net of their leaders was not al
lowed to do so. It was an exam
pIe of practical politics, miinus
principle.
There is a law on our statute
ibooks prescribing penalties for
bribery at primary elections. Will
the next grand jury consider this
matter. Hais not this thing of sel
ling and buying votes openly gone
far enough Some imen in the
parish think it has, and they are
tired of having their votes, which
were cast from motiv\es of princi
ples, nullified by those of mien
which were bought.--lD)emocrat
Journal, Mansfield. La.
If the Shreveport Jiudige will
- look closer home. s.y in l)eSoto,
it will se, Republicans comnbining
with Democrats, who by voting in
a Democratic primary, allied them
selves with D)emocracy. It's charge
about the Pops and Repulblicans
fusing, is so absurd that every
reader of the article, "They will
Combine," in its issue of I1th Inst.,
has considered that it is another
one of those brilliant say-nothing
and mean-nothing productions for
which the Judge is noted. It ar
Srogates unto itself, the I)emocracy
and the Republicans, all the polit
ical wisdom imaginable, and would
lead the masses to believe that the
Populist party manages its cam
paign without leadership, and by
sheer force of numbers. The
most sensible thing the Pops have
ever been guilty of, was their quit
ting the Democracy, an example
which the Judge is no position to
follow. Now that the campaign
has opened, our speakers and lead
e,rs will take the stulmpl against the
field, and it will rest with the hear
ers as to whether or not our party
has any sensible leaders.
In regard to the suffrage Amend
iment we will have more to say la
ter on. "Suffi:ient unto the day
is the evil thereof."
TAE NEW ILLUMINANT.
Acetylene to Revolutionize Our
Methods of Lighting.
Prolbably the nmost startling dis
covery of this decade has been that
of producing acetylene gas so
cheaply that every indication points
to it eventually replacing all other
illuminants. It has long been
known to science, but as a labora
tory production only. About two
years ago the discovery was made
that lime and coke dust fused in an
electric furnace produced what ap
peared to be ordinary slag. This
when thrown into water was de
composed, the oxygen of the wa
ter uniting with the lime, the hy
drogen with the carbon, thus pro
ducing the hydrocarbon known as
acetylene. That this is the finality
in illuminants sounds reasonable,
when the composition of sunlight,
as it is now known, and the strik
ingly similar qualities of acetylene
gaslight are compared. It is near
ly pure carbon vapor. The most
delicate colors under it show in
their natural hues. The same soft
shadows are cast under its rays,
showing ifs diffusive qualities. It
has at least fifteen times the illu
minating power of ordinary gas,
and photographs can be taken by
it. A burner using three quarters
of a foot an hour will light a large
room so that the smallest print
may be easily read. It is produc
ed from the two most widely dis
tributed minerals, lime and coal,
so that the supply is therefore
practicably inexhaustible. The
candle power of a thousand feet
of ordinary gas oan be duplicated
with acetylene gas at a cost of fit
teen cents less. It is compressible
into the liquid state at about the
pressure qf a soda water flask
366 feet of it occupying one cubic
foot making it possible to deliver
it at houses in cylinders, as soda
water is at present. The simple
connection with the ordinary pipes
of the house is all that is necessa
ry. One cubic foot Will last an
ordinary family for a month. It
will be an admirable street lamp
illuminant and compressed into
cylinders it can be used for byci
cle lamps, burning anywhere from
ten to twenty and fifty hours.
