Custer.
The 1R'1e nltlat neivspapers have, '1
with great unanimity, seized upon abe
thie dimsaster which befell General Cus- ici
ter and his troops, as a reason for the
urging a policy of exteliuinatlon. thr
They are perfectly right; Wis a, war gra
of extermination, thorough andi coi- stoi
plete, that should be carried'on. But heI
they are altogether in error 's td the bor
object upon whom the Operbtion exj
should be performed. It itnot the Loi
Indians who should be swept from wit
the face of the earth, but hinm ir his kir
minions who renldered the dalamity tile
and its cause possible. gAl
The sooner we view in its proper put
light a transaction of this nature, the ali
better it will he for is. A.re~"I the
w.idoi, s one slue 11 a Atiuggle, do
would be a glorious victory-a mang- foo
nificent exploit, an evidence of heroic Oal
spirit and hardihood, a specimeun if Th
indomitable pluck iand contempt of er'
danger, cannot upon the other side be the
a brutal and horrible measure plan- the
ned and carried out with devilish
malignity which calls for vengeance at
upon every member oif the tribe which int
has perpetrated it. The fact is that ryi
the Indians have, under provocations se'
the most atrocious, conducted them- pre
selves--no doubt through the force of as
circumstances-with a placidity of exl
delmeanor hti'lt would have charact- aga
eticid very few more "civilized" peo- thO
ple similarly beset and imposed upon. in
When, a few years since, an attack I
was made, under tI orders of Gen- thi
eral Sheridan, upon Red Holse's vil- in
lnge, and upwards of 170 of the tribe, tIh
mlost of them old men, women and fl
childreun were slaughtered in cold ale
blood, the village destroyed, and 300 tin
horses stolen, the event was not a t
horrible massacre, but a great victory.
This Red ,Horse band, ba it reinemlt- wa
ercd, was not a lhostile tribe ; the stc
villaige was a quarantine settlemnent, D
occupied by victims of small pox, yet, sit
without any reason but that the hands Ge
of our soldiers niuSt Ie kept in the air
practice of murder, that the flahiciou8 y
instincts of human nature might be fat
fed and stimnlated by the taste of ize
human blood, the, whole of the in- he
halbitanlts, 173 in nutmber, of whlm er
.but about two do2eu were able l'd
bodied men, were butchered and we
destroyed; The less we say about mi
tile barbarit3 of the [ldians the better. 1Ia
But still the fate of Gteural Custer BI
and his men calls loudly for ven- si
geance. They were murdered, bar- th
baroursly and ruthlessly inurdered. wi
But not by the Indians was the das- sti
tLodly deed performled ; they simply Sd
did what we should have done under go
the circumstances, defended them- TI
selves anlid theirs fromi hostile attack. w;
No, the responsibility for the attro- of
cious murder, the assassination, rests tl
upon the shoulders of the President ce
ianld his horde. It is the laascally Ad
iniuistration that shouild be externi
nailted, not the Indians.
In what manner have we, under
the rule of Gralnt, been in the habit ti
of dealing with the various tribes of
Indians, whose lands we batte stidil d
and appropriated to our use and oe- f
cupation ? Simply in a way that is a
disgrace to civilization and hamanity.
It We have pretended to treat with c'
- them as independent nationsh and ti
I- and have made treaties with ithem. sl
t Then, with the brutal codecoudnesa of
d bullies eualtingin their strength, we
o have without cause, other than the w
'r pursuit of our own advantage, broken j
those trepties, and Ifrcdeeded to mur
. der the defraudded if they should pre
e sume to resent the injury. W*e have t
r efteoatlraged the .men of odt dice arid p
e color to look upon them as wild '
h ioimals, and kill theor whenever they
toald get da liad~ee without danger
to to tiieselves. We have held every
nmurdeter of ai Indian as a benefactor tl
of to his race and w'orthy of reward,
st every londian mourderer. of a white P
4. man as an unclean beast, who with 8
n. any dthers of his rae that we could i
eatchl; lbould be swept fHon the face
of the earth. The detestible creatures
in whomse haunds the arios tribes
Shltve been placed, biute for the sake
of personal gain, even suppiled them
with tie most approved weapons of
warfareg and nowv when we have ex-:
asperated theem beyonad endurance by
oar villaig, we cry "exteromination"
because they have oRed uponi s the
iostrmumeats we have placed in tlheir
hands. The wholesale murder' *f
d Caster and his men is one of the most
deplorable of tile result.
Anid this is Ihb way in which every
branch of the public-servlce is coilt
Sducted. Yes, extermination shotit
*be the eryi Let aus tti'st from us
every man wiho has had a hand in
bwilding up the system. Grant, and his
MlUni!lsttration are the murderers of
the 'uoble Custer and his brave band

poir the execrable deeds of one of his
