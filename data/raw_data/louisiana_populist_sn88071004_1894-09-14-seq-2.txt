,.·.·]~EMMrr elawnsu45re .m a
think of Dan Voorhies, (Dem.)
cheek by jole with John Sherman,
(Rep.) in the effort to demonetize
silver, and to still further extend
government favors to national
banks. Think of Republican ilu
tocrata heartily endorsing the Dem
ocratic administration. Think of
the lucid terms in which the Mc
Kinley tariff law was denounced
" (before the election) as the culmi
" eating atrocity of class legislation
as robbery of the great majority of
American citizens for the benefit of
Sa few. Think with what placidity
the same democratic administra
tion permitted this atrocity to re
main on the statute books with all
of its atrocity, and even now the
pretended makeshift for a tariff law
is but very little better if any.
Think of the issuance of $50,000
000 in interest-bearing bonds in the
, time of peace and when there was
. 183,000,000 of gold and silver in
* the United States treasury and that
' these bonds were contemplated and
arranged for by the Republican
party and even the plates engraved
* and the plan carried out to a letter
by the Democratic party.
Think of the fraternization of the
! Democrats with the Republican
methods. Think of Cleveland ap
pointing Republicans, black and
white to important positions of
honor and trust. Think of Cleve
land violating sacred rights of State
sovereignty, and how he has been
landed, therefor by Republicans
, and Democrats alike. Think how
by machine politics each State that
has held a convention has been
forced to endorse the Cleveland
- administration when it is a well
known fact that the majority of
the people regard it as the most in
famous administration that has
been inflicted upon the people.
Think of the manner in which
the Democrats of the State of Lou
isiana denounced the high protect
ire policy of the Republican party.
Think of how the Democratic party
Shas been pleading with the negro
to endorse the Democratic adminis
tration and to come to its support.
Think of how the Democratic party
of the fourth congressional district
rejected the proposition of the
People's party to maslly settle the
much looted question of white sn
premacy, and that too, after the same
Democratic party has been howl
ing 9egro duomintion for twenty
years or longer. The bottom is
blling oat of Democratic preterts
in a hurry, and it is all owing to
the great system of education that
Is waged by the People's party
press, it is true, that any system of
education which has for its object
the enlightenment of the masses g
the people must of necessity be
slow, but i is the only sare course
to purse, among the many eviden
ees that we are right, is the contin
ued renewed vigor with which the
eduestio of the maes me so perd
sistently opposed. It is an indis
lpetable logical concleasion that if
thei system of edueation that is now
beaing earried on by the People's
party was not msterially endanger
lng theb s of the od pluto
eratic parties, there woald ot be
aso muh oppo.itiou and o many
efortsto destroy it. Now let ua
say to every intelligent man in this
country that there tIs beyoand anay
quwestion a movement on foot to
erush oat the reform movement
thatis now going on, and if it is
neeesary to do a., the two old par
ties will be aslie la i ch eothera
arms. They are determined top kee
the people divided. Youa bhave evi
decse that al carporations ad
tnrast doate money to carry elec
timh by had or otherwise; and
remember, particularly, that thiq
boodle had is given, not to one of
the old parties, bet both, and not
thnregh "seatheat" or "patriot
ism," bet as a "'uias" matter,
and nla aorder to "lame" hgsla
tton tia favor of the great moey
Spowae, and how well thoey have
s eeeaded, the hismry e oer egis
Ilate hr the last thirty yearn too
plainly shows. The oely mans of

I i the goed work, and the South is
git halng that wayq, the money
peaers se their doe pily writ
ten and their only chance to sare
themselves is the e dt to tarn the
ilslrheer te ttherepablsms, aad
It~' - ~ ~aea
sion is shown by the boldness in t1
which the southern portion of the a
State has completely floped over. o
I They as Democrats have always c
I told the cotton farmer to seek re
lief inside the Democratic party;
the utter absurdity of such a course
is now made plain by their own ac- tb
tion. Are the intelligent people of ti
this country who have been fight- C
ing for Democratic supremacy for I
twenty-five years, and at last suc- C
cessful, only to be flopped over n
body and soul to the Republicau
party, going to be made the pliant t4
tools of those political schemers, t
for no other reason than, that mon- a
ied plutocracy may succeed t This n
deserves the serious consideration
of every thinking man in this coun- b
try.
Now is the time to act. Have
the intelligent people of this coun
try become so demoralized and de
graded that they are willing to be
come as so much commercial pro
duce, to be. bartered and sold to
any political party by a few design
ing political boese? ,
We can not prevent these bosses r
from making the sale, but it is the
duty of every patriotic American
to see that the goods are not deliv
ered. We can do this by going to
the polls and voting for the Peo
r ple's party.
In order to further bear out our i
conclusions we will quote some of
the expressions used in a meeting
in the lower part of the State of 1
Louisiana on the situation.

The Old Parties Disiategratlag.
CLEVELAND, Ohio Sept. 8.-Af
ter a hot fight in the twentieth dis
f trict democratic convention, the
Chairman announced that H. B.
r llewington, Populist candidate for
Congress had received the endorse.
r ment of the convention.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Sept. 8.-Af
t ter being in session five days and
taking 571 ballots, the Democratic
convention failed to make a nomi
nation.
Gen. Weaver has been endorsed
by the Democrats.
Senator L. H. Pngh of Calcasieu
parish, resigned his position as
member of the democratic execu
tive committee of the 3rd congress
ioual district, and severed his con
nection with the democratic party.
Senator John P. Jones of Neva
da, who has for over twenty years
represented his State in the United
States Senate, has formally an
nounced his withdrawal from the
Republican party and allegiance to
the People's party. teuator Jones
is a great addition to our ranks.
This gives the People's party a sol
id delegation from Nevada, which
was formerly Republican.
The Argonaut, a Republican pa
f per published at San Francisco,
Cal., has quit the Republican ranks
and joined the People's party.
FRANKFORT, Ind., Aug., 28.
In convention here to-day the
Democracy of the ninth district
endorsed Alonzo G. Burkhart, the
Populist nominee for Congress.
The Chieftain of Lacrosse, Kan -
sas, has been a leading Republican
paper for sixteen years, but has re
nounced all allegiance to the grand
old party, and joined forces with
the Populists.
J. H. Clawson of Kansas, has
purchased the Weir Citizen, and
will run it in the interest of the
People's party. It was formerly a
Republican paper.

The great Democratic leaders
have been howling Democracy for
thirty years, and the brat eAhmoe
they got at it the dadgumed stuff
made 'em sick. The masses of the
people have been sick for some
.time from taking the same medi
Sine, but every time they complain
ed, the political quacks prescribed
more democracy (so called). It is
evident that this is the rast dose of
the nostrum that the leaders have
ever had, and from the amount of
squirmming they are doing it has
made them mighty sick, and see
ing that the great masses of the
people are seeking to establish a
remedy that will give esrtain re
lie1, the same leaders are trying to
delude them into patreiainla the
Republiean quacmks. Bat it will not
work, gentlemema, no, ano.

The telepraphic announeements
that Hos. Newinn Bland haslur
found it necesary to go to Earope
for his health will be cheerful read
ing to those of his eonstituents
who have to s9ene areond peartly
to get a quarter to buy a box of
Wright's pills to work the malaria
out of their systems. There is
something remarkable about the
promotion of men to ofie; the big
ger the omee one gets the farther
from houe he has to go to lnd
hiisbeslth. A littl wee bit of a
constablie or justce of the peaee
may manage to go to a neighbor's
out in the country for a week's rest
but when the exalted position of
United Btates Benator is reached
nothing less than the watering
plaes of foreign countries will do.
We hope, however, Newton will
have a good time and will ome

start by paying almost New Orleans pri- i
ceo for same. We trust our merchants
L1- will be able to hold up at paying out
an side figures on cotton, as the farmers
re- need more than they will be able to get

Our school opened up on the first Mon,

ad Up to this writing our musical depart

Misses Ruth Patterson and Fannie J

Mr. W. H. Latham, your genial pub

of It is reported of him that he has found I
a new route to Montgomery, by
coming all the way down on the west
SO side of the river.
Quite a crowd of Montgomeryites at- I
Sa tended religious services at St. Mauries

of listenaing to a very interesting and in.
straetive sermon delivered by Re.. Joy
ner, of your eity, at 11 a m. There

a highly ecomplishemd young lady of our

me many womanly christian graces preslded
at the organ, assisted by a few gentle

tly, it was good to be there.
ly I cannot forbear mentioning a anus
of ing, ad which came near being a seri
one incident, that took place on our
streets early BSuday morning. About a
desen of our yong gents rigged up a
four mule teem for the purpe s of on
ig- vraying all of their erow6 to St. Maurice,
er and had improvised seats by ploeing two
ad long planhk full length la the cuter edgo

Jest each a tambling out of the wagon
yea never sw, sme fell on their backs,

fll I ately no one was seriously hurt, and
the males was checked upbefore running
down to the ferry landing. The boys,
