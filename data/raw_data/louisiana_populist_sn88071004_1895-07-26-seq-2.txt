FRIIlAY, JULY '6, 1!95.
The meeting of the State Alli
ance will take place on Tuesday,
6th of August, and not on Thurs
day the 1st of August as anno|nced
in my circular to the Alliance.
JOSIAH KLEINPETER,
President F. A. & I. U. of La.
.July 20th, 1S95.
The Free Silver democrat who
urges that the fight be made inside
the )Democratic party is a simple
ton, an office-seeker or a goldbug
in disguisc.
The only hope for free silver in
1896 is in the uniting of all silver
nmen, either in a non-partisan move
ment or in the People's party, the
only free silver party in America.
Will the La. Populist please
explain to its readers how it is
that it can consistently join hands
with Adunams & Co., on any issue
after its editor has repeatedly said
that they were traitors of the first
water.-Demands.
In the same way that you join
hands with Bro. Goodwyn and
Monk Wells in supporting the gold
standard.
'lhe true Populists of Grant
arish want Judge Machen for
District Jge and you may put it
down as a fact that they will go
into nothing that they think will in
jure his chances for judgeship, as
they consider any move that would
injure Machen's chances of elec
tion as anti-populist.-Domands.
Then why don't you take down
the Omaha platform in the adjoin
ing column, and stick up your
true one, "Machen for Judge."

I .eV"r In'1e ) t'e4l to any lan oplelt to ihe
'onllme rosrosl~l us .itizens, and re
tlklt thbe genius of our lilberal ^ov
ei'rnimenl, we are encomIlassed with
destitution and want among our
fellow-citizens, t4K agonizing to
describe. Production in every de
partment of agriculture has, for
ten years, Ilten the most ibuntiful;
indeed, it would suggest to ration
Sal men the greatest plentitude of
every necessary that a state of
comfort could appiropriate or even
wish. But instead of plenty we
are Imiade to want, instead of an
availiable surplus in the homes of
our i~oplle, those homes are mark
ed by a cruel destitution. Not
only this, our indebtedlness has as
sumed such awful proportions that
nothing short of a change of cir
cumstances or repudiation can ever
relieve our condition. None would
wish to repudiate, and none can
hope to pay.
What must be done ? Nobody
will say make more, and to make
less wouldl be fatal to our families.
The fault is not with our produc
tion, neither our economy, but to
the infamous laws of exchange and
distribution, is traceable the germ
of our ills.
These, it is not only our prov
ince, but our duty to reform. This
can only he done by our votes.
We can never prosper so long as
the laws remain as they are; no
never, twenty years of declination
is enough to show that. To change
the laws we must necessarily change
the officers. Not the men as offi
cers, but the principle upon which
they are elected, and on which they
invariably act. What can our
people ever hope to accomplish
under existing conditions?
How can we overcome our pres
ent indebtedness and livef l oes
not the fact stare us in the face
that our indebtedness is to-day
greater than our worth? Our
yearly productions of every class
of marketable things sold at the
present prices would not meet the
annual interest charge on our 32
billions of debts. Do we realize
the fact that there is, on an aver
age, in the United States scarcely
30 per cent of the people who own
their homes free of incumbrance.
If so, and we know as we do,
that values are gradually sinking
on our products, superinduced by
the ruinous policy of the monied
classes who are interested in dear
money and cheap products, how
can we succeed? What force yet
undiscovered can we expect to in
ject into our system to change in
our favor that which has brought
our ruin. All rational men agree
that volume and not the value of
money is the regulator of prices.
Plenty of money is cheap money,
and hence, good prices for that
which money is to buy. A scarci
ty of money is dear money, and
therefore it requires but little of it
tolbuy a large volume of produce.
We are interested in cheap money,
and hence high products. At the
close of the war money was plen
tiful and every kind of produce
high, and so continued till the ruin
ous policy of contraction origina
tel by IHugh McCullough,
its crusade agaiat the peoe's
money. It culminated in the h
mo-s crime of 'T7, that struck ail
ver from our coinage laws, as they
stood, and provided a clear field
for bank aotes and gold to appreci
ate in value. A liberal sentiment
among all chases created a change
that canaed the rehabilitation of
silver in 78.. From then till the
call amion of gre in August
1898, it w prctiay recognised.
It rmaned for this deogratic
adminlstratio., pretending to rep
reeat the oa Jeferson and
Jacks0o, tBrmer, who stab
lied the aliver dollr as the stuad

can at once sete that it has already
cost the people allot *13.00 per
capita to preserve that awful "par- i
ity" IBtween gold and silver, which t
''"p:arity" all know has never Ibeen
disturbed. Who ever heard of an
American dollar selling at a dis
count Still, an imaginary fear
that soniithine, not only improba- I
blo, but absolutely unlikely, might (
occur, has made the theives now in
government harness involve you I
in an increased llndedl indel,ted
ness of One IInndred and Sixty
Million dollars, running from 1u
to 30 years.
We have no need to state all the
iniquities which have completed
the record of this so-called demo- 1
cratic administration. It stands I
out in history as the blackest piece t
of political demagoguery that these 1
United States has ever experienced.
The annals of republican fraud 8
sink into nothingness in com pari- t
son. A Congress of cowards, a t
cabinet of pliant agents of Mor- c
gan and Belmont, and a President I
guilty of pnrivately contracting a
government obligations to a com- a
pany of Europeans, at a price that I
lost to the people 9 millions of 1
money, while hundreds of Ameri- c
can investors were knocking at the
doors of the Secretary of the Trea
sury, asking for the bonds at a
better price. This, all by the par
ty that pretended to reflect South- t
ern sentiment and the laboring t
classes, and Who sung in plaintive 5
notes from one side of this Union i1
to the other: "Only give us a
chance."
And to this class you will still E
look for reform? How can ration- t
al men expect it4 How long will t
the long suffering people have pa- f
tience with such deception? How
long will the mere name of that C
party tie the people to its ghost, b
when the virtues have fled to a tl
purer sphere. P
We don't believe that patriotism
is wholly extinguished in the breast
of our fellow citizens. Their no- 0
bler manhood though crushed by n
oppression and stinted by suffer- p
ing, will reassert itselt, like it did o
in the trying moments of our rev
olutionary fathers.
Cleveland has left. vou no
room to ask for leadership; you n
must follow or he banished. He
has drawn the line between what tl
he terms the friends of sound mon
ey (gold standard) and the silver- -
ites. You can follow Cleveland
and the gold standard to ruin, or
jyou can ask for the restoration of
bimetalism, and the standard of
the fathers that never become dis
paraged by the assaults of conspi
rators.
Plenty of money, the govern- 1
ment control of oppressive mono- t
polies, and the consequent pros- pr
perity of those who labor is the W
slogan of the People's party. Will
you do for us what you have done
for the others--give us a chance.
There is now an attempt in con
templation by the party schemers
of the Bryan, Bland and Sibley
wing, to divert our attention from
every salutary feature of the Pop
uiist platform, and to persuade the e
people to make this campaign on
silver as a single issue. For what l
isall this? Can the English lan- n
guage be made more positive than B
our platform on this question? We
have fought for the free and un
limited coinage of silver at the ra
tio of 16 to 1, ever since the pro
mulgation of our platform. Why
surrender the platform that has B
won us two million votes in one
campaign, and is to-day winning
ground, and even driving the pests
of corruption out of the cities, B
electing mayor's and councilmen to
control them.
Why desert our lsag to-day toB
gooff with these criers for one s
sue, who traduced us for organi
zing a "third party" as they were
pleaad to cal it, -and who are to- Ds
day engaged in a flimsy effort to
organize a "fourth party."
They would use us to elect their
design, and they would then do - c1
they have previously done-leave
us i the lurch.
LIet our platform remain invio
late. Let our cry be more money
-not better money. Let us con
leal for the abolition of land mo
mopolies, which is the only promise '
_- people has to acquire homes.
We can never aford to surrender
that plank, for its importance is
rasedent to us. Let us clamor C

NATCIIEZ. LA., July 23, 1895.
Ed. La. Populist :
I feel that I must say something
in regard to this silver movement.
I am sorry to see the want of har- 1
Inonv or concert of action in the
Po ulist ranks.
I want to find out how you, who
are jIpulists. are going to go with
the 1 iemoratS anii I form a new iar
ty. We, down here in ward 9,
don't uinderstand how things are to
be arranged l are we to get the
denloorats together in mleetings
and thenll induce themn to join the
People's party ! Or are we to go
into some new party, and abandon
our principles .
WARD NINE POPULIrT.
Answering the above we will I
say that all we have ever proposed
to do, or would have been willing
to do, was to have our Populist L
State nonlinating convention of
delegates elected fresh from the
people, and instructed by them,
meet, and if they liked it, indorse L
the "free silver and fair elections"
ticket, which it was supposed the
free silver democrats and republi- I
cans would put up against the gold
bug tickets that will be put up by
the machines in each of the old
parties. D
This would not affect in the least
our parish and district nominations, E
nor the organization of the Peo
ple's party, which would go right
on educating the masses of the
people upon the three great princi
ples of the Omaha platform-ti
nance, land and transportation.
No populist has ever suggested H
the idea of leaving the People's
party.
