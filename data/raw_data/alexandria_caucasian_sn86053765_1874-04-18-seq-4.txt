Tlio Orange and the
CATHOLIC FARHKR«.
DECISION OP TIIE POPE.
THE ST. LOUIS GLOBE of tlio 10th
iilt., makes tho following impor
tant announcement:
Roman Catholic farmers desirous of
joining tho order of tho patrons of
husbandry,, have hitherto had in thoir
way tho laws of their church, forbid
ding its members to identify them
selves with secret sociotios. Of our
American prelates wo believe that
Archbishop Alemanry, of San Fran
cisch, has hold that tlio Catholic far
mer will do well to ere on the side of
safety, und so not join tho gratigo un
til the Pope has cvproHsod Iiis approv
al of ifs objects, while other, liishops
have forbidden members of thoir flocks
from becoming patrons upou any con
sideration.
Tho matter has been finally adjudi
cated on by Pious IX, as uppears by
tlio Norisk Volkeblad, tho Scandinari
au organ of Minnesota.
A Catholic member of tho State Leg
islature was desirous of joining the
grange, but had conscientious scruples
about doing so, arising from his reli
gious belief.
Ho consulted Father Ireland, of St.
Paul,* who referred him to llishop
Uraco. Roth these clergymen ex
pressed themselves as -possessing a fa
vorublo impression of the principles,
objects and methods of the grange, but
neither of them could break though the
alisoluto rule of tho church, and they
recommended the legislator to appeal
to Rome.
Ho accordingly laid tlio matter bo
foro the Pope, to whom ho transmitted
at tho name time full particulars as to
tho objects contemplated by tho order,
and the means by which it was pro
posed to attain them.
A reply has been received from his
Holiness, stating that the Pope allows
tho petition to join the Grange oj
Patrons of Husbandry, and ho n. mem
ber thereof, if he find nothing there in
conflict with his conscience, or tho
creed of the Catholic Church.
As a congregation, the ordor lias
received a largo accession in Minnoso
ta, and whori the news of tho Pope's
decision has reached other States, its
effects will be largely to increase tho
numbers of tho patrons, and to remove
the interdict laid upon Catholics do
sirious of becoming such? by prelates,
who have disapproved of the Grange,
and been doubtful as tho consistency
of its obligations with those of the
Church.
Notice !
To all who arc Afflicted
with Chronic Oiwca*cw.
DR. JAMES PORTER, Magnet
ic and Medical Physician, will re
main in ïs r ew Orleans at No. 107 St.
Charles Street, until tho coming
June" and all who are suffering
from Chronic Rheumatism, or any
Chronic complaint, should immedi
ately, place themselves under his
treatment, as, from niy own expe
rience, he is sure to afford relief,
and if the disease is not too far ad
vanced, a permanent cure.
His charges aro very moderate,
and 1 am glad to certify that, after
nearly eight years of constant suf
fering from Chronic Rheumatism,
(the last three years of which time
the torture both day and night has
been excruciating), and after being
treated by many of our most emi
nent and skillful Physicians with
out relief. I placed myself under
the treatment of Dr. PORTE It,
about the 1st of last February and
remained about five weeks, during

reason to believe he has effected a
