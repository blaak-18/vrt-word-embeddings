Considerable Excitemant.
Considerable excitement was caused I
Sihreseport Tuesdas by the discovery of
metalic collin ccntaiilng the body of
you- g woman in a fair state cf preserva.
tf Lion, in the west end of the city. A gang a
d eo:cred laborers employed in trading wore
a ucear:hed the cfin. While the corpsi
t was app renly weil preserved it crumblec
to pieces a, soon as the air touched it
t There is abso:u:elv no way to account fo!
the presence of the body in that section cl
bhe cit). for it was never ued as ouria~
groitd. Authcrities are puzzled over thb
afftir, but have no doubt but the woman
S'ied a natural death.--Manbfeld Journal,
The '"(xceiment" was limited to tie
SdJournsl and to the Times, w: In their
'fforts at sen.ation gave the unear:hing of
the cottia a;1 :he gryW'ome eftect and col
oring ac their command.
The coffin coctaine l the body of a white
gir!, aged perhaps 1t years, wh) was
buried Irom 1854 to 1t58 in an iron coffin
i|t which there was a patent r'ght covar
lar these years, and these were sold in
Shreveport in limited qiantit.es to Deople
at means residing In this State, 'i,
Arkansas and in Texas. The deceased
was no doubt the daughter of wealthy
parent., but when did the burial take
place and who were her relatives is not
known. There are very iew of the olUzens,
,hen adults, who are living to ay.
Not long since, in an exeavation tr a
street, a lot of bones of human beings
were uncovered. Theeo Wlre placed in a
sack and relaterred. There was no lurid
sensation over this discovery.
Not many weeks ago, in another excai
vation, mops human bones were .dug and
bhese received considerate and reepecttul
attention.
No raention in grewsome lines we-e
alven to satiate the eraving for sensation.
Not many years ago, a great number of
grave were unoovered in a spot in the
heart of this city, where a street was being
graded, but all the bones and remains were
gathered and were reburied. There was
no sensation then, only a bare mention of
the dhsovery-a ten or fifteen liaes oeal
told the story, but this is the age of sensa
tione, and of exaggerations, when truths
and facts are not held at a premium.
We held that the unearthlng of the iron
seol, contalning the remains of a girl,
auried a balf a century ago, did not war
rant the grueseut stonres given in orist,
out as we are not attending to other peo
