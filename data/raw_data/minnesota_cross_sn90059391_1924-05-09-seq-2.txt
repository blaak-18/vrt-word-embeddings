(Rurrau »f Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., April 30
A letter written on stationery of the
Associated Shorthand Reporters, 801-
803 Federal Reserve Bank Building.
St. Louis, and addressed to Luke E.
Hart, La Salle tfuilding, St. Louis,
makes interesting reading. Hart is
the naan who replaced Pellitier, the
deposed Knight of Columbus official
whom Senator James A. Reed, of Mis
souri, defended some time ago. It is
interesting because it outlines the re
action which is taking place in the
minds of the opposition towards the
Ku Klux Klan. The writer and au
thor of the letter are known, and it
is unnecessary to say that both are
non-Protestants. The letter is as fol
lows:
“St. Louis, Mo., Apirl T 7, 1924
“Mr. Luke E. Hart,
“la Salle Bldg..
“St. Louis, Mo.
“Dear Luke:—
“You. no doubt, read in the papers
yesterday the details of the debate
at the Democratic convention at
Springfield on the Ku Klux Klan res
olution, and were impressed no doubt
by the strength the organization
showed in defeating the resolution
as prepared. I firmly believe that it
is high time some offensive movement
is undertaken to stop their activities
and prevent their misleading the
American public.
“When you consider the great harm
they are doing, and the powerful
force behind a properly organized
combination of tne Catholics, Jews
and negroes, if properly directed, you
cannot help but realize we ought not
lie dormant.
“I suggest you foster a movement
towards this end and in my humble
way have outlined a rough manner
for its accomplishment. This idea
can be greatly improved upon by you

and other men of brains. The work
ing basis is as follows:
“First, that representatives be ap
pointed or elected by each of the
three, viz.: Catholics, Jews and ne
groes to carry on this work.
“Second, that an affidavit, be pre
sented to all candidates for public
office by these represenfatives, said
affidavit being substantially that: ‘I
solemnly swear that I will never in
any way, shape, manner or form, di
rectly, or indirectly, oppose, oppress
or show’ preference for or against any
man or group of men on account of
their race, color or religion.' That
every candidate refusing or neglect
ing to sign said affidavit have his
name published as broadly as funds
will permit, stating that he had re
fused or neglected to sign affidavit,
and calling on every Catholic, Jew,
or negro to scratch said candidate.
“Third, that funds be solicited
among the three for the purpose of
publishing the harm being done by
the Ku Klux in stirring up strife and
citing their records in Louisiana and
recent occurrence in Pititsburgh, etc.,
the graft in order and records of
their heads.
“There are many rich Catholics and
Jews, and many also that are not
rich who would contribute generous
ly to this fund; and I believe if a
systematic plan is worked out you
can wipe this organization from the
land.
"Kindly give the matter your seri
ous consideration, as you are in a
splendid position to start and foster
this movement through the Knights
of Columbus.”

CHARLESTON, S. C., May 2.—The
wide-awake chaps who are at the
head of the local Klans in Province
No. 3 are planning for a public nat
uralization to be held at some con
venient point in the near future.
Nearly every Klan in the province
has a class ready, and it is planned
to have these consolidated and given
the secrets of the organization at the
same time. Committees are already
working out the details, and it is ex
pected that a definite announcement
can be made in the near future aa to
the time and place.

COOLIDGE FACES HARD
KNOT IN ALIEN BILL
Endeavoring to Please Congress
and Church Faction and
Secretary Hughes
(Bureau of Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., April 29-
President Coolidge is squirming to
beat the band on the immigration bill
m account of the Japanese exclusion
clause, and he is seeking a respite of
60 days in which to try to find a
way out of the perplexing situation.
It is reported on pretty good au
thority that the president has about
decided not to accept the bill as it
is with the Japanese exclusion legis
lation a part of it. He also knows
that the present bill passed both
houses of congress by overwhelming
majorities, and it begins to look like
a test of strength between the exec
utive/ and legislative branches of
government.
President Coolidge no doubt wants
to do the right thing, but he is con
fronted on one hand by the insist
ence of Secretary of State Hughes
and subjected to enormous pressure
being exerted by the organized
church interests of the country that
some method be found to soothe Ja
pan’s wounded pride. In this man
ner, Secretary of State Hughes is
hopeful of hitting upon a solution
of the question that will satisfy the
exclusionists in congress and at the
same time apply a poultice to Japan
ese feeling. Whether it can be ac
complished or not is extremely prob
lematical.
As originally drawn, the house bill
would make Japanese exclusion efc
fective July 1, when the present im
migration law expires. Smarting
under the sting of Ambassador Hani
hara’s “grave consequences” letter,
the senate passed a bill making ex
clusion effective immediately.
The two bills are now in confer
ence. President Coolidge has asked
and probably will obtain an agree
ment on the July 1 date fixed by the
house for the exclusion clause to take
effect.
WASHINGTON, D. C., April 28.
If you want to know just how the
people of the Pacific coast feel about
the immigration bill and the Japan
ese exclusion clause, read the follow
ing editorial from The Seattle Star:
“At last, it seems, the white man
is to have a chance in his native land.
Both the United States house of rep
resentatives and the senate have in
no uncertain terms called Japan’s
bluff. The immigration bill, with the
Japanese exclusion clause, has gained
the approbation of both bouses of
congress, in spite of Jap threats and
traitorous pro-Jap action on the part
of some Americans who poee as
statesmen.
“For years The Seattle Star, almost
single handed, has been fighting for
just that thing. Barring of oriental
immigration marks victory.
‘There is ne doubt concerning the
danger of an restricted Japanese im
migration. There is no qaeetion of
the Mitsui chicanery, as evidenced in
the Standard Aircraft cases. These
things being aa they are, jest why did
a lot of newspapers betray the white
race? Failure to take ep and fight
the white man’s battle for ownership
of his native land was just that.
“We have a moat excellent exam
ple of it right hare in Seattle."

THE FIERY CROSS
Events in the Lives of Little Men
Wig Wags from^Washin&ton
(Bureau of Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., April 29.
Counsel for former Governor J. C.
Walton, of Oklahoma, in a brief filed
with the United States supreme
court, announced that they enter
tained “faint hope” on favorable ac
tion by the court upon the appeal in
which the former governor sought a
review of his impeachment by the
Oklahoma legislature.
When the case was called for ar
gument, counsel for the former gov
ernor was granted further time in
which to file a brief, the court re
fusing, after having advanced the
case at the request of the former
governor, to postpone its considera
tion.
The brief which has just reached
the high court covers substantially
the same grounds for appealing to the
federal courts as were given in the
brief filed when the appeal was dock
eted. It alleged conspiracy on the
part of the Ku Klux Klan to get him
out of office after he had declared
martial law in his fight against that
organization. In closing the brief,
counsel said that “with great re
spect” for the supreme court, they
had submitted the case for final de
cision “with faint hopes” of success.
Difficult to Pronounce
Picked at random from today's list
of appointments to commissions in
the officers' reserve corps at the war
department, appear tne following
names:
Harold Simmelkjaer, Johann Cissna,
Adrien Ferdinand Le Tarte, Thor
Wangberg. Robert Goeltz, Abraham
Lazarus Kushner, Simplicimo Var
gas, Carl Kapka, William O'Leary,
Solomon Goldstein, Carl Lohr and
Heber Sotzin. '
These fellows think they are Amer
icans; perhaps they are by adoption,
but the point is tnat they are com
missioned to enter the great citizens’
army of this country and will fight
the next war if it comes. This list
of names smacks of almost every na
tionality in the world.
Is it any wonder the Klan and oth
ers are fighting for restricted immi
gration laws?

First Division Monument
First division men (the Rainbow
division) of the American army that
went overseas is interested in know
ing that the 35-foot marble shaft of
that division has been raised in posi
sition on its base just south of the
state, war and navy building in
Washington. It is going to be a mag
nificent monument when it ia fin
ished.
A solid piece of marble, 36 feat
long and weighing 56 tons, ia said to
be the largest block of stose ever
taken out of an American quarry.
Private Daniel Edwards will unveil
the monament on October 4 of this
year. Edwards was selected aa the
First division’s outstanding hero. He
lost his right arm and the use of his
left leg in overseas flgfcth*. His
last exploit was to go AWQL from
his hospital te join the division in
the Soissons offensive.
President Coolidge will have a part
in the dedication of the abaft.
Washington Stato Wants
School Law Like Oregon
(Scottish Rite News Bureas)
WASHINGTON, D. C., May 6.
Ibat the voters of Washington will
have a chance to determine whether
or not they want the so-called Ore
gon school law on their statute books,
ia the statement made by proponents
of the Oregon law, regardless of the
fact that the Oregon law has been
held unconstitutional in that state.
It ia the belief of those who want
Washington’s school children sent to
public and not private or parochial
schools as a matter of law, that the
supreme court will reverse the deci
sion of the iewer court and that the
Oregon law will finally become effect
ive la Oregon, aad therefore, if U te
passed, in Washington also. Several
other states are understood to be
planning the submission of similar
•els to their electorates, if the ap
peal which baa bees taken to ths su
preme court Is secceasfut.
Challenges klan Leader
Edward E. Carroll, past chancel
lor of the Barrett council, Knights
of Columbus, whose membership em
braces northern Hudson county. New
Jersey, has announced that he had
challenged Joseph L. Harvey, exalted
cyclops of the Hamilton hlan of the
Ku Klux Klan, which also holds forth
in North Hudson, to a debate on
“Americanism.”
In a letter which he mailed to Mr.
Harvey, Carroll offered to meet the
Klan leader on 24 hours' notice to
debate with him in public the posi
tion of their respective organizations
on the subject topic.
Think of a K. C. wanting to talk
on “Americanism.”

SENATOR BORAH DENOUNCES CORRUPT
INFLUENCES IN AMERICAN POLITICS
In a forceful speech in Washington
recently Senator Borah declared that
huge campaign funds were a corrupt
influence in politics. Large contri
butions from corporate and financial
concerns, he asserted placed a polit
ical party under obligations to pri
vate interests and made honest, pub
lic-spirited, efficient government im
possible. The seriousness of the sit
uation is greatly enhanced when cam
paign managers openly solicit these
contributions.
Students of political conditions will
readily admit the force of Senator
Borah's criticism. Immense cam
paign funds are a demoralizing influ
ence in public affairs, .and drastic
laws properly made may be enacted
to curb the eviL
But while we are discussing demor
alizing factors, why not tell the whole
truth and point out that another
class of interests is menacing demo
cratic institutions in the United
States. They are the racial and sec
tarian groups, well-organized, well
financed, following an unscrupulous
and astute leadership, and who are
persistently seeking to undermine and
to vitiate American ideals by the in
terjection into our national life of
principles foreign to our American
ideals and culture.
The restlessness and lawlessness
prevailing in this nation at the pres
ent time are not the result of eco
nomic injustice and social inequality
so much as the logical consequence of
continual agitation by clerical and
racial propagandists, who, in order
to promote the interests of a church
or to maintain an alien racial cul
ture, carry on sinister campaigns of
criticism and condemnation of Amer
ican institutions. By means of emo
tional sermons and addresses and by
cleverly worded pamphlets, an effect
ive appeal is made to the prejudice,
passions and ignorance of the people,
and wide-spread dissatisfaction and
turbulence are inevitable.
This ferment is capitalized through
organizations and propaganda and is
used as a club over the heads of leg
islators and administrative officials
for the purpose of controlling legis
lation and the execution of the laws.
I ike the sword of Damocles, the
threat of defeat hangs over the heads
of the fearful public officials. Usu
ally the menace is greater than the
actual peril, but the timid politician
DAVIS URGES NATION
REGISTER ALL ALIENS
Secretary of Labor Talks Before
Chicago Lodges of B’Nai
BKith
(liareau of Publirntlon and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., April 30
The United States must Americanize
the alien before the alien alienizes
America, James J. Davis, secretary of
labor, declared in an audress the oth
er day before the Chicago lodges of
the Independent Order of B’Nai
B’Rith.
The need, Secretary Davis said, is
for a system that will give the alien
honestly desiring to become a citi
zen the help which he must have to
accomplish this end, and “to clear the
way for the elimination of the alien
who is here in defiance of our laws,
or who seeks to abuse our hospital
ity by preaching the downfall of our
institutions and the destruction of
our form of government.”
Secretary Davis proposed a plan of
enrollment for the registration of
every alien entering the United
States, requiring him to make an an
nual report to the government. By
giving him an identification card en
titling him to the benefits of an ed
ucational system already established,
Secretary Lavis said, every alien
would be given an opportunity to be
come a citizen under a simplified nat
uralization plan, while it would be
easy to weed out the undesirables.

is prone to take the threat at its face
value. A loud voice, a bulldozing
manner, a hundred well-directed let
ters, and the sectarian or racial men
ace assumes in the imagination of
the worried office-holder overwhelm
ing proportions.
The average legislator may well ex
claim: propaganda doth make cow
ards of us all. At a recent dinner
in Washington a well-known states
man declared that the average con
gressman was honest, but lacked
eourage.
A baptism of moral courage and a
passion for American principled
would enable our legislators to boldly
challenge these sectarian and antf-
American agitators and under a brave
attack their boasted power would
collapse like the Spanish fleet under
Dewey’s guvs. Their propagandas
are mostly noise, pretense and fus
tian, and their influence all out of
proportion to their actual strength.
But meanwhile their influence up
on our state and national law-maw
ing bodies is demoralizing and uttei>
ly subversive of those principles of
righteousness and even-nanded just
ice that must prevail in a well-or
dered and progressive democratic
commonwealth.
So we recommend that while con
gress is investigating the influence
upon current legislation of large con
tributions to partizan campaigns, it
also take up an investigation of the
activities of those religious and oth
er organizations whose character and
objects are frankly alien to Ameri
can institutions and culture.
