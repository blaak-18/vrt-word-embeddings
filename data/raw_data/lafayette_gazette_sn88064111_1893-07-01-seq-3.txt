A Little Hero.
Tuesday last, Aleck, the Itttle 8
year old son of Dr. H. D. Guidry,
with his chum Tombadie, a little
negro of the same age, escaped from
the parental toof and went down
to the bayou to take a swim. Now,
let it be known that whatever Aleck
would do Tombadie would join in
a kind of Robinson Crusoe and
Friday partnership. Aleck can
swim like a fish and Tombadie can
not. Aleck started out for the op
posite shore and when in midstream
turned his head and to his horror
saw that Tombadie had tried to fol
low him, and had got out of his
reach and was. making desperate
efforts to keep afloat. Aleck know
ing Tombadie could not swim,
turned and swam back, reaching the
shore threw a piece of wood to the
negro who made a catch for it but
missed. Nothing discouraged Aleck
got another piece of wood, threw it,
and this time hit Tombadie, who
was fast sinking, but in his wild ef
forts managed to grasp the piece of
wood, and held on with grim des
peration, and it kept him afloat.
Aleck hallooed to Tombadie to keep
cool, and started off for help, which
secured, they returned to the scene.

Marriage.
* An event which called forth gen
eral interest in our little town, was
the wedding, last Tuesday, of Miss
Marie Robert, only daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. J. R. Robert, and Mr.
Charles Heicheiheim, of New Or
leans, who is now assistant in the
public school at this place. The
marriage was solemnized in the
presence of. a large concourse of
friends, at a grand nuptial mass at
.St. Peter's Church, Carencro, by
the pastor, Rev. F. B. Laforest.
The altar was beautifully decorated
and illuminated for the occasion,
and the music furnished by the choir,
of which Mr. Heiclethein has been
for years the efficient and faithful
organist, added brilliancy to the
occasion.
The sweet young bride never ap
peared to better advantage than she
did in her costume of pale, pink
China silk. and white lace, with the
bridal veil and flowers upon her
head, and as the sun, which burst
forth after several days of rain,
shone upon the bridal couple
at the altar, it was the opinion of
loving and admiring friends that the
handsome groom while choosing his
help-mate for her sweet womanly
attributes was, nevertheless, well
mated, even in appearance.
"All the world loves a lover,"
says some old author, and during
the beautiful ceremony the hearts
of young and old beat in sympathy
with the happiness of these two, be
cause they were new representatives
of the noble estate of Christian
marriage. and, again, because they
are both so highly esteemed in our
coinmunity.
Mr. and Mrs. Heichelheim start
ed a couple of hours after the cere
mony for New Orleans, on a visit to
the groom's mother, and upon their
return, a few days after, took pIos
session of their cozy little home in.
Carencro. Their friends wish them
heartily bon voyage through a long
and happy married life. L. D. R.

There must be something wofully
deficient in the existing drainage
laws, or some people are pe-r- itted
to do pretty much as they please.
"Good roads" is the popular cry
of the day, not only in :his State,
but throughout the country. Any
one with reason can readily see that
they can hope for little or no im
provement until certain . laws are
enacted, or the present ones, if any
exist, are enforced. Laws that will
direct or compel each planter to
drain his own farm or plantation,
and not depend upon diminutive
road ditches to convey water, that
a canal many times their size could
not adequately do. And people
should not be permitted to throw
up levees, or cut trenches across
public roads, where and when their
fancy dictates! In a rolling coun
try like this, drainage could be
properly and easily maintained,
if only a proper regard was shown
for the law of nature. It is a ques
tion whether the Police Jury would
have any authority in the matter,
but their is no doubt that the Grand
Jury could afford relief if the matter
was properly brought before them.
There is something wrong some
where, and no doubt there is a reme
dy, if the authorities would only
apply it.

Mr. Chas. Valot; ofstur vicinity,

at poisoning during the last week,
and really we are lead to believe
that a "suicide club" is in full blast
in our midst. It appears queer to
us that these parties should take
just enough poison to nauseate them.
Probably a bluff. At all events, our
physicians and druggists are bene

It may be recailed that when C.
F. Clark (who was apprehended in
Vicksburg, and is now in jail here),
made his rounds in Lafayette, some
time since, recklessly appropriating
his neighbor's goods, * among
the articles stolen by him was a val
uable case of surgical instruments
belonging to Dr. Frank Mouton.
The prisoner has persistently refused
to say what.had become of them;
but the following letter received by
Sheriff Br9ussard shows where they
are at:

S. Rasin,Wallis was born in Terrebonne
parish, December 22, 1843, and died in great
peace at his residence near Lafayette, La.,
June 27, 1893.
Consumption, that great human destroyer,
had been gnawing at his vitals for months
past, and finally frail nature fell dead under
its withering power.
The custom is too prevalent to heap ex
travagant eplogies upon the name of almost
any one after death, but too much will not
be said in the praise of the deceased. We
are told that he was a model husband and
father, the very embodiment of truth and
honor, and in all his business intercourse
with his fellowmen he was just, and his
name was without a blot. In addition to I
these sterling qualities, he was a devoted
anp consistent christian. Not in name and
form merely, but in deed and in truth. The
writer questioned him relative to his chris
tian experience before he became confined
to his house and bed, and again when ap
proaching the end, and when only able to
.tac in a ishiper, and he said, first and jast.
that he was perfecitly resigned to tihe' Divine
will, and that there was not a cloud betaween
him and heaven." He talked and sent back
words of cheer from the brink of the last
river. It is a trial to as all to lose such a
man, but it is comforting to know that he
has gone to a more genial clime where there
is no death, nor wasting disease, but ever
lasting health and life. II. ARMSTRONG.
