P rZsanable Metals - ew TWrinkles
In the Dinner Service.
One of the marked features of the
present is the use in table and toilet
wares of metals other than the white.
Right royal has been the road of
burnished copper to favor. Its rich hue
strikes the eye strongly: its soft luster
strengthens the first pleasing impres
sion. In its splendid color there is a
depth and yet a delicacy that arrests
and holds the fancy.
Burnished copper with silver orna
ment appears in vases, desk and smok
ing sets, tankards and range, umbrella
handles and numberless small things,
but the new combination is handsomest
on the toilet table. Imagine a Watteau
plaque in gray silver enlivened and
warmed with a decorative frame of
shining copper, the whole forming the
back of a hand mirror. Silver deposit
work in copper is most effective.
Silver gilt is also now much used and
is not at all confined to purely decora
tive objects, but enriches all sorts of
table silver from spoons to complete
tea sets.
The small and odd wares of the table
offer much qovelty. Here for elegant
service are the ramequins of decorated
French porcelain set into a pierced sil
ver frame, with the one long side han
dle characteristic of the cruder proto
type, and there are silver entree dishes
with ears and a cover resting upon a
small plate.
Bouillon cups of decorated china in
silver frames with loving cup handles
form a charming array.
Peculiarly attractive are slender choc
olate cups of French porcelain deco
rated in pink and provided with frames
whose base of pierced silver is a square
instead of the usual circle.
Quite a pleasing wrinkle for the host
ess abreast of the times are the dainty
little individual almond dishes that
fdrm a set with the regulation almond
dish.
The oyster cocktail glass has become
a thing of importance i he past year.
One example of it in porcelain on a
silver standard takes the form of the
ordinary champagne glass and indeed
might serve either purpose.
Highball glasses -are tall, tempting
affairs of crystal set in a circular frame
with handle.
Russian tea glasses to accompany the
samovar rest upon a small silver plate,
with a fixed circular cup in the center
for the reception of the glass.
A fashion of the day among many
good diners is the serving of mineral
water directly after coffee, and a tum
bler of approved size, placed in a rather
heavy gray silver base, is the silver
smith's provision for this custom.
Decidedly Unique is the, plan of a sil
ver cracker bowl where the center of
the wide, shallow bowl is arranged for
the reception of worcestershire sauce.

All Sorts of Wash and Thin Silk
Fabrics-Chic Spring Models.
Wash fabrics for midsummer wear
are already being shown, and experi
enced shoppers declare that now is the
time when selections should be made.
as every line is complete and exclusive
novelties are soon exhausted. One of
the daintiest of diaphanous fabrics is a
light, sheer gauze striped with mer
cerized liies" of more solid weave, also
in white. At intervals are ribbon stripes
of dre sdeln pattern and the price is GC
cents a yard. The colors in which this
last effect is obtainable include blue,
pink and 11:(-k and white.

serviceable mnatorials for shirt waists.
as it washes and wears very well.
Nothing looks more fresh and clean
than the white grounds with small
mercerized stripes of self color set with
tiny blocks of the same. Figures, dots
or wee little squares of color in broken
lines are showered over the entire sur
face. The price is 2S cents a yard, and
the material exceptionally tine and
nice. One of the best designs is a tri
angle of tiny dots in blue, black or red.
French canvas is a new material es
pecially adapted for shirt waists, and
has a good, strong body and smart
weave. Stripes of color defined with
an edge of black are alternately solid
and lacy in effect. The price is 55
cents.
Oxford shirting is again to the fore
and costs but 18 cents a yard. A good
pattern is of tiny squares made of
triple half moons centered with a dot.
Mercerized cheviot is still another va
riety of these wash fabrics and can be
recommended for shopping or walking
costumes in a pretty design of broken
checks. The effect is not unlike the
shepherd's checks used so much last
summer, but yet sulfficiently different
to be new-price, 39 cents a yard. This
comes in different sizes and in black
and white or blue and white. Large
solid spots are a favorite design for
plain materials, a rose silk and linen
pongee being patterned with these diots
in a less definite shade of the same
colors and costing 18 cents. This comes
in blue and other light shades as well.

seat and the staircase of white painted
wood, with a contrasting note of color
brought in by the adoption of cherry
spindles. The square panels and the
Ionic capital and column add to the
architectural value. The side lights at
each side of the front door and two
side windows (one on the stair land

wall paper is a cherry red in the dull

STwlee Wake d*U xead4-Good Fer the
Teeth and the Digestion.
The Custom of twice baking the
bread is becoming quite a common
thing with a great many housekeepers.
This is most frequently due to the ad
vic$ of a physician, for zwieback is a
standard remedy for indigestion and
lbenleficial inl some kinds of kidney trou
ble. But the greatest good to be derived
from its use is its .ff.ct u1upo1n the
teeth. This should ci:dear it to every
mother who has the welfare of her
children at heart, as a child cati have
few better inheritances in the shape of
bodily perfection than a set of heatl:y
teeth.
It is said that the habit of eating s,
much soft, sloppy food is the reason so
few have perfectly sound, strong te th!.
Even more terrifyillg consequellces ar
predicted. We are told that if this same
practice is adhered to a toothless race
will be the result. Though such a ca
tastrophe is highly, improbable, we arc
faced with the fact that the great ma
jority of the people of the present age
have not half as good teeth as did their
grandsires. The teeth, like every other
portion of the human system, have a
given amount of work to perform to
keep them in a healthy condition.
Food which requires but little mastica
tion deprives them of their appointed
tasks and makes them weak.
Consequently children should be giv
en all the zwieback they will eat, and
adults, too, will find that the health of
their teeth can be improved by its con
sumption. But of course all this hy
gienic inducement which is held out
would probably prove fruitless if it
were it not for the fact that the taste
for zwieback i? an increasing one.
Few people who have eaten it, even
but a short time, care to go back to
common bread, for it seems soft and
insipid after the crispiness of the re
baked.
The Vienna bread makes the best
zwieback, although any other kind of
baker's bread will do if this is not ob
tainable, but homemade bread will not
give satisfactory results. ,In preparing
if is a good plan to cut up several
loaves in slices of medium thickness.
Place them in the oven and allow to
remain there overnight subjected to a
moderate temperature for twelve hours.
Bread h'eated in this way will be supe
rior to that which is baked in a quicker
oven in a shorter period.-Table Talk.

our grandmothers and great-grand
mothers delighted, mounted as one of
the pretty little reticules, which are a
fashion of the present almost as much
as of the past. On either side of the
bag is worked a garland of old world
flowers, the "polyanthus bright and

poem, snowdrops, double pink daisies,
convolvulus, hawthorn, wild strawber
ries with their blossoms. auriculas,
lilac and jonquil, shadled with the deli
cacy almost of brush work. The fine
canvas is left, unworked, as back

that (on what is presumably hbe Out

blespoonfuls of milk, three well beaten
eggs, one heaping teaspoonful of bak

of sifted flour. This amount of dough
will be enough to generously cover the
bottom of four layer cake pans of ordi
nary size. The rule is an excellent one,
and by -using different fillings an al

may be obtained.

Embroidered letters for marking uin
en ue no new device, but now that,
crochet work is so popular again the
clever idea has o('nurred to one worker
to utilize it in the makin:; of these let
ters. The letters are done in what is
known as Iriilh crochet. which is so
pretty anl lcelike, that it hears a
great r'ese-.: lance to Venaetian rose and

needle occasionally, but not to any
great extent. A stitch here and there
has been employed to give the correct
expression to the leaves, and the orna
ments are all made separately and
sewed on.
The skillful worker should be able to
construct her own designs for such let
ters, those sketche4 here being only in
tended as suggestions.
The round ornaments of various sizes
are all made on the same plan, either
with or without an edge. The cotton is
wound round a knitting pin until the
required thickness has been attained,
and single treble then worked all
round. They are all made round and
pinched into the shape required.
The Figure of Today.
Tall, slender women have it all their
own way. The perfect figure has been;
discussed of late, and the fiat seems to
be that slenderness combined with
good lines is essential. But it is no
good being thin unless you are willowy
and graceful. The taller, the more
slender, the better; the shoulders,
broad, the arms long, the waist line at
the front long, the hips well shaped,
neither flat, nor hollow. The line must
be straight from under the arms to the
ankle. There must be a slight outward'
aurve at the back of the waist. It is,
the greatest mistake to pad over the'
hips. One of the artifices of a fashion
able corsetlere is to lace the hips into a
fat line. Stays grow longer and conse-,
Quently far less comfortable, but while!
they lengthen below the waist they be
come shorter above.
A Good Batter Pudding.
A good batter pudding is made by
beating two eggs, adding one cupful
of milk, three and a half cupfuls of
sifted flour, three tablespoonfuls of
melted butter, one-half of a teaspoon
ful of salt. one tablespoonful of sugar,
two teaspoonfuls of baking powder and
one scant cupful of canned cherries or
any small fruit. Turn this into a well
greased mold, cover and place in a
steamer or pot of boiling water for
two. and a half hours. Serve with it a
creamy sauce.
A Short Coffee Coat.
The original coffee coat, which did
not attain to much favor, has grown
shorter and shorter, so that smart
models are now practically boleros as
regards their length and shape, and as
