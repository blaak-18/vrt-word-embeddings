If the Town Council cannot af
ford to have the grass cut in all the
streets of the town let it make a a
desperate effort to raise enough
money to cut the high weeds that
adorn the gutters along Lincoln
Avenue. A stranger facetiously re
marked the other day that it looked
as if the town allowed the grass to
grow so luxuriant on the streets
to advertise the salubrity of our
soil as an inducement to prospective
settlers.
It is to be regretted that every I
person on whose land the proposed
railroad switch or branch would be
built did not see his or her way clear
to signing the paper giving the right
of way. It requires very little think
ing to see the great benefit to be
derived from the proposed branch
to every land owner along the route.
Without such a branch cane produ
cers in that section are compelled
to haul their cane in carts, which is
well-nigh impossible in rainy
weather.
We understand that Col. Breaux
has a large cane crop on his planta
tion which would be the terminus of
the branch. The construction of
this road would greatly facilitate
the shipment of the Colonel's crop
as well as that of the other planters
on whose land the track would pass.
Firsc Trial.
The new cotton gin recently
erected at Broussard by a company
composed of Messrs. St. Julien Olih
vier, Girouard and Reaux was given
a trial last Saturday, when four
bales of cotton were ginned. Every
thing in the mill is of the latest im
proved kind, guaranteeing first-class
and prompt service to cotton plan
ters. Broussard can now boast of
two large cotton gins which can not
'fail to increase the town's trade.
At Alexandria.
A number of people from this
town took advantage of the low ex
cursion rates last Sunday and visited
the city of Alexandria. The excur
sion was given by the excursion
club of Franklin and everything
connected with the train showed
fine management on the part of the
members of the club. The excur
sionists spent most of the afternoon
at the Alexandria base ball park
where a game was played by the
club of that place and one from
Franklin, resulting in a score of z6
to 2 in favor of the former. Another
attraction was the leap of an Italian
from a steamboat chimney4ofeet high
intothe red river. This daring jumper
is on his way to New York where he
will make arrangements to jump
from the Brooklyn bridge. He says
he will soon rival the famous Steve
Brodie.
The Sunday law in the "Central
Queen" is an unknown quantity as
far as the saloons are concerned.
It had been said by some that it
t was. only in Southwest Louisiana
that the people were wicked enough
to break the Sabbath and violate
the Sunday law, but those who
visited Alexandria last Sunday were
convinced of the utter falsity of
this statement. At any rate all un
t p'ejudiced people will readily admit
that a glass of cool beer was a vast
t1 improvement on the circus lemonade
' sold at the park.

A Negro's Sudden Death.
1 Dick Bartlett, a negro, died sud- d
denly during the night of Saturday
- and Sunday in a cabin in the lum
i ber yard of Moss & Mouton.
s Sunday morning Mr. Mouton, the
r junior member of the firm, went to
Barlett's room to see what was the 1
matter with him as he had failed to 1
show up for breakfast. Mr. Mou
ton called at the door, but no an
swer came from Bartlett. He then
e suspected that Bartlett had left, but
P imagine his surprise when the open- i
s ing of the door disclosed the dead
body of the negro lying on a bed.
The man had been dead sevetal
y i hours as the body was rigid. The
Y cause of his death is purely prob
lcmatical as the night before Hart
n lett had eaten a hearty supper and
sr showed not the least indication of
- sickness. Near his bed was a but
I- tie of patent medicine, which it is
s said contains violent poison. Some
entertain the belief that an over
if dose of this medicine was the cause
it of his sudden death.
After the customary inquest by
the coroner the body was given to
is the town authorities for burial.
- Mr. Mouton says that Bartlett
d had been in his employ since a
r- month and was a good workman.
,n He hailed from Grand Coteau where
g he claimed to have worked three
d years at the convent of the Sacred
e Heart.
r- A Thief Runs Against an Officer.
n Last Tuesday a strange negro
k arrived in Broussard with a cow and
te calf which he tried very hard to
m sell. The people of the town sus
6 pected that there was something
-r -'rotten in Denmark" and sent a
.n courier to inform Constable Mala
;h garie of the suspicious actions of
ar the negro. The officer was found on
te his way to Broussard, but before
p that place was reached he met the
's negro coming along the road driving
re the cow and calf. Upon inquiry
the officer was informed that the cat
al tle were for sale. The officer told
as the negro that he woud buy them if
1. he (the negro) would return to
it Broussard to get the money. To
Ia this the negro readily consented,
h but after a few steps were made in
te the direction of the town the niegro
o suddenly stopped and told Officer
re Malagarie that he would go no
of further and demanded his money
a- then and there. The officer, who
it was going to town on private busi
st ness, was unarmed, and did not
le know what was the best thing to do,
but he realized that something had
to be done and caught the bridle of
n- the horse and placed the negro
er under arrest. The latter pulled out
r. a large knife and made a pass at the
O officer, who being unarmed, had but
e one thing to do and that was to let
le go the cattle thief, wrho left his
a booty behind and started at full
Sspeed. The plucky officer was not
discouraged; he armed himself with
a gun and in company with two
Sdeputies went in pursuit of the fugi
he tive whose escape was made easy by
ad the night which had set in and the
thick cane fields of that section..
y- His horse was found in the road.
