VICTORIA-19 PARLIAM.NT tDUITDINO.
Sbanded together against the world so
far as their prosperity is concerned.
The new government has some won
derfully novel plans for the betterment
of the people of the country. Under
these plans Austraha will be pre-emi
nently a land for the workingman. Ac
cording to the constitution of the co !,
nmonwealth, parliament is given the
tight to pass laws for invalid a old
age pensions and to legislate in any
way that will develop a viore and
more ideal social organization.
Furthermore, the government will
have control of the telegraph, tele
phone and postal services. Talk of
governmental control of railroads is
heard on every side. The labor ques
tion is not ignoLed, parliament being
given the right by thy constitution to
pass conclliation and arbitration meas
ures dealing with labor disputes. Tak
en all in all, it may safely be said that
the workings of our legislative body
will be watched with interest by the
civ4ilzed world.
This city, which will be the capital
for at least a year, is the finest in the
country, and zealous patriots are try
Ing to prove that it is the finest in the
world. In any event it is a city with
a remarkable history.
In the year 1837 Melbourne consisted
of five small wooden houses and eight
huts of turf. Now it has a population
of 500,000, 20,000 business buildings,
500 schools, 300 churches, over 1.100
hotels or saloons and is one of the rich
est cities of its size on the earth. There
are men yet living who can look back
to the days when Melbourne was In its
infancy and to whom the change must
seem nothing less than the work of
magic.
The site of the present city was
once owned by an individual, John
Batman by name, who bought it from
the natives by the payment of 40 pairs
of blankets, 42 tomahawks and some
knives, scissors, shirts and looking
glasses. If John Batman's heirs were
now in possession of it, they would
own ground worth in the neighborhood
of $100.000,000. But even John Bat
man himself was not allowed to re
main in undisputed possession. The
natives had been trafficking with oth
ers, and there were many people who
contested Batman's claims.
In the end the governor came from
!Sydney and laid out the town, selling
the lots at auction. These lots sold for
from $150 to $2.500 apiece, the land
that brought the latter sum now being
worth $15,000,000. The highest bid
ders that bright morning in 1S37 laid
the foundations of fortunes. The auc
tioneer took out his pay in land which
be lived to see worth $1.250,000.
Within five years the town had 6.000
inhabitants, and it was then incorpo
rated. Ten years later came the dis
covery of gold in Ballarat. and Mel
bourne grew by lea'ps and bounds as
the gold fever took bold of the world.
That, in brief, is the story of the birth
and development of this greatest of
Australian cities.
In everything Melbourne sets the
pace for the other cities of the federa
tion. It has spent $10.000.000 for har
bor improvement, and that the money
has been wisely spent is evident to
any one who will take the trouble to
Investigate. The city is at the bottom
of eastern Australia. near the mouth of
Yarra river. For six miles one can
walk along Melbourne's wharfs and
can count fully 40 bridges crossing the
Yarra and other streams in the city
and suburbs. The harbor is beyond
criticism. Steamers of 8.000 tons bur
den, drawing 23 feet of water, can
come right Into the city. while vePsels

the large hall is an organ, which was
until recently th , biggest in the worMl.
and the city pays an organist a salary
just to play it twice a week for the
amusement of the people.
And this brings me to the considera
tion of the dwellers in the gates of
Melbourne. They know how to live.
They are not wrapped up in business
cares, but have an eye to pleasure as
well as to fortune building. In and
around Melbourne are 1,000 acres of
race tracks, 12 football and crick.s
grounds, 100 parks and public ,gar
dens. Of course the great sport f the
public is cricket, but they ar. evoted
to horse racing of the runn g, not the
trotting, brand. The c)P claims to
have the finest racini( park in the
world. It is known cf the Flemington
course, has an area/of about 300 acres,
and the track is a mile and a half
around. The whole area, except the
iround given over to grand stands,
bracks and stables, is covered with a
velvety green lawn. At the great races.
notably on Melbourne Cup day, hun
dreds of thousands of people go out to
Flemington.
There are two tracks, one running
inside the other, the outer being for
races on the fiat, the inner for the "lep
pers," or steeplechasers. The inclosure
within these tracks is a f'.e field-that
Is to say, Is for the benefit of thc se
who would like to see the races and
cannot afford to pay for their fun.
The grand stand is built on a hill at
one side of the course, and the seats in
it cost $2.50 each. Directly behind it
on the hill itself are equa'ly good places
for 62 cents ea2h. From either of these
locations a man can have a view of the
horses for the entire route and need
not lose sight of the race for a mo
ment, being just where he can clearly
see the finish.
As I said above, the great game of
the Australians is cricket, the national
game of the motherland. The .Mel
bourne Cricket club was founded al
most coincident with the beg.nning ot
the city and now has more than 3,000
i ETJOUrnI I [ CO
MtzTafoxmR LAW cOUETS.
members on its rolls. Twenty men are
kept at work caring for its property,
and for this purpose the club expends
about $350 a week in salaries. Already
more than $500.000 has been spent on
the cricket field, which covers about
nine acres, half of this being used for
playing.
The city, as has already been hinted.
takes great pride in providing places of
amusement and instruction for its peo
ple. T'here are all sorts of public in
stitutions, such as art galleries, muse
ums, baths and technical schools. There
Is also a workingman's school, which
has several thousuuad students, and
there are many night schools. The city
also maintains an aquarium and a
splendid zoo.
Melbourne is in many respects lil:e
an American city. It has grown rapid
ly in the past, and there seems to be
no reason why it should not grow rap
Idly in the future.

The revival of polo in this country
will bring back into prominence the
many characteristic and attractive fea
tures of the game for which it was
formerly distinguished.
Polo is pre-eminently a game for soci
ety folk. The excessive cost of the
paraphernalia required for the diver
sion-as in yachting, horse racing and
automobiling-debars the majority of
sport lovers from participation therein.
The scenes at a popular polo ground
while a match is on are fascinating
and kaleidoscopic in the extreme. Tal
lyhos, smart traps, blooded horses,
beautiful women gayly attired in
many hued summer gowns and hosts
of lesser lights surround the spacious,
green carpeted, oblong inclosure.
The efforts of the players to drive the
wooden ball between the ,oal posts at
GUARDING TH1 GOAL.
the ends of the scene of conflict pre
duce intense excitement. Accidents
are frequent. Broken legs and arms
are commonplace injuries to the vet
eran poloist. The ponies, game little
fellows, take their punishment like
stoics, never ceasing their slmedy dash
es, headlong plunges and quick turns
while the 15 minute periods are in
progress.
The pony is one of the unique fea
tures of polo. He must have capa
bilities, the lack of which renders him
entirely unsuited to the purpose. The
pony bred for the game has to be
trained and broken for the game. IHe
must learn to turn in his own length,
to stop quickly, to start instantaneous
ly from a walk to a canter.
In England, where polo is a favorite
recreation among the well to do, the
players "make" their ponies them
selves. A poloist wilt!l buy a colt and will
train him with the greatest of care.
Here in America, however, the "mak
ing" of polo ponies is in a large meas
ure left to the breeder, who has not the
time to bring them to perfection.
The American polo ponies have a
much harder life than their English
counterparts, because the major part
of their training Is administered to
them at a time when they are much
older. Oftentimes they are wild ri'on
chos, lassoed out of an unbr ken herd,
saddled and bridled by force and the
next day started at guarding cattle.
After a pony has had several n.onths'
experience in herding, "cutti:ng" and
driving cattle he becomes a good candi
date for the ranks of polo. If he is
sound, under 14 hands 2 inches and has
done commendable work among the
cattle in Texas or Mexico, he is shipped
to the east, the polo center of America,
where he becomes acquainted with
shoes and also finds out the meaning of
docked tails and clipped manes. An
English saddle and bridle are placed on
him, and there is an American polo
pony ready for action.
He is not so fast perhaps, neither so
good looking, as his English cousin, but
he is handier, able to carry more
weight, hardier and much cheaper.
Naturally a pony in England, with
breeding, care and training, is woith'
considerably more than our American
animal thrust into the game in a hap
hazard manner. Frequent'y $3,000 is
paid for a really good pony by John
Bull, whereas here $1,000 is far above
the average price.
