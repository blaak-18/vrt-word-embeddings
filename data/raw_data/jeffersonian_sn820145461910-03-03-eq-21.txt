Sad Plight of the Homeless
Verbatim Copy of a Letter Written
by One of the “Bread Line.”
The following letter from a typical
member of the “Down and Out” Club
at the Bowery Mission, recently visit
ed by President Taft, throws a flood
of light on the hard experiences of
the homeless in the great metropolis.
The letter was addressed to the Fi
nancial Secretary of the Mission.
New York, Dec. 20, 1909.
Dear Sir:—The writer of these
lines, a German office clerk, is with
out employment since about August
1, 1909. Last Saturday night an
other poor man, who slept beside me
in the park, said that Mr. John C.
Earl, of the Bowery Mission, w<|uld
help me, if I told him my wife was
sending me money from Germany to
come back home. I had eaten noth
ing that day, and the police put me
off the seat, so I lost the other man
and walked about all night by my
self. I could get nothing on Sunday
to eat, and if you had not given me
that food on the Monday I think I
would have died.
From about August 10 I have
been walking from office to office,
from factory to factory, without re
sult. My money, saved during the
time I had been working, is now al
ready about ten days gone, and only
with the greatest economy I could
keep me so long. Since I am “down
md out,” I only was eating “free
lunch.” At noon time I would ven
ture into a crowded saloon, where
the lunchman was too busy to see if
you had a glass of Deer or not, and I
would take a plate of soup and some
bread, and in the evening I eat cold
“free lunch.’
The hardest thing for a poor man
without a home is how and where to
spend the night. A.fter about 5:30
P. M., when the offices were closed, I
went to the reading room in Cooper
Union and stood there, usually till 10
o’clock. When there was any service
in a German Protestant church, I
went to church; sometimes I have
also been in a Gospel meeting of the
Wesley Rescue Mission or the Bow
ery Mission. When it was too cold
to walk the streets, or ’raining, I
would spend 5 cents for beer, if I
had it, in a saloon on the Bowery,
where you can have free lunch and
sit the whole night for that 5 cents.
In those saloons you can see all class
es and characters of people—poor
men of all ages, sitting sleeping on
a chair, or laying on a newspaper on
the floor, who I do know would pre
fer a bed to a drink, and who were
anxious to obtain work of any kind.
I have been in the Bowery Mission
Bread Line several times. We would
stand about one hour or more out
side, until the doors opened, and me
and the other poor men were all so
glad when it was one o’clock; hun
gry and freezing men, all waiting for
a cup of hot coffee and rolls. You
can believe me that it is not so
agreeable to stand one hour or long
er outside on the street in this win
ter time, without anthing in the
stomach, freezing and shaking on the
whole body. Some in this Bread
Line are well educated, and have
seen better times, like me. Most of
the men praised the Bread Line, and
a few were making fun about it. I
fp say, for my part, that no poor
•Aian can be thankful enough for this
institution; and how different you
feel after having had a hot cup of
coffee, that makes you feel better
and warmer! Out of the conversa
tions of some men I heard that, after
having had their cup of coffee and
rolls, they would try to get back on
the end of the line to secure another
portion. I can not say if they have
been lucky in their trial; I never
was. I went , after having had my
portion, downtown for to get me the
first morning paper and look for a
position, the same as the other men
did.
I repeat once more that I praise
the Lord for the night that I heard
of you. In my country, Germany,
are not so many poor men as there
are here in this city. Every poor
man has a home or a bed; also there
is more work. I have been employed
in the greatest cities of Germany—
in Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne, Bre
men, etc.—but have never seen so
znany men without work as in New
York; also, I imagine that it is easier
to secure a position in the old coun
try, therefore I wrote home to my
wife for a ticket to go back to Ger
many. Thanking you for kindness
done me, and begging your pardon
for disturbing you so long, I remain,
very respectfully yours,
W. ERDELEN.

Why Men Desert Wives.
A Large Per Cent of the Wife Deser
tions and Divorces Due To
Female Weakness.
I should have taken better care of
myself, I suppose. I was sick and suf
fering. No one but a woman can ever
know how I suffered. I was irritable.
I couldn’t be to my husband the wife
that I ought to have been. He, being
a man, couldn’t understand. We drifted
apart. He sought his pleasures else
where. Finally there was nothing but
the divorce court that could settle our
differences. i
That’s the sad story that eight out
of every ten women who have passed
through the ordeal of the divorce court,
as well as the countless thousands of
deserted wives who are not divorced,
know deep down in their hearts was the
real cause of their troubles.
