WASHINGTON, D. C., March 31.—The political situatio in
Washington this week is still being discussed in terms of oil and
ire are breathing the fumes that have filled the air for the last two
aionths. This certainly is a “winter of discontent” in Washington,
and the men on Capitol hill are still plugging away on scandals or
alleged scandals, one by one. These scandals apparently touch all
three branches of the government, the legislative, judicial and
even to the executive, or at least a studid effort is aimed at the
executive which it is believed the country is going to resent, for
ap to the present time President Coolidge has escaped unhurt and
mharmed.
Messrs. Pomerene and Roberts, spe-
rial government attorneys, are on the
job in the far west, where they have
tied action at Cheyenne and in Cal
ifornia to place the oil fields in the
hands of a receiver, as it were, and
looking to expulsion of the Doheny
and Sinclair interests from same.
Also steps are indicative of prosecu
tion of all who are found guilty of
corruption and graft. The American
people are expecting just this sort of
expulsion and prosecution and will
be satisfied with nothing less. They
want the government attorneys to go
to the roots of the evil and dig them
ap clear to the last end. There must
aot be one law to protect the rich
sad another law to convict the poor.
Borah‘.Makes Suggestion
On the other hand, Senator Borah,

tbs senate and asserts that the peo
ple will hold congress responsible for
aay failure to enact tax legislation
and other relief measures. He inti
mates that all of this session must
net be ken up with investigations
and declares the time has arrived
when the senate should dissolve it
self “as a grand jury” and resume
tbe business of legislation.

al is not considered very good here.
We have been getting stuff second
hand, third hand and by intimation
from men and women accused of or
at least indicted as murderers, black
mailers and conspirators. The Ameri
can people do not like that sort of
witnesses, even though the attorney
general might be guilty. It has all
been juicy reading, but everyone
knows it would not go for one min
ute as evidence in any well regulated
court in the country. It all goes to
show what a mud-slinging campaign
we are approaching. That is why our
presidents are having a hard time in
getting good, clean, honest men to
serve in public office for the reason
that good people do not relish put
ting themselves in position where
they can so easily become besmirched
with mud and rubbish, no matter how
innocent they may actually be. How
ever, the old saying holds true, we
must have people in public office
who will regard such a position as a
public trust and not as a private
snap and who will conduct them
selves accordingly. That is an Amer
ican idea that holds good today as it
has in the past.
The thing that the public is think
ing of is, that if Daugherty and Den
by are guilty, they should be im
peached, and not merely covered over
with mud and then requested to re
sign from office. That savors too
much of the game of playing politics.
Here’s More Politics
President Coolidge is no slouch
himself when it comes to politics;
Democrats admit and charge that he
is a past master at the game. Look
at his latest California appointment.
The new secretary of the navy, Cur
tis D. Wilbur, is said to belong to the
Hoover wing of the Republican party
in California, and of course Senator
Hiram Johnson does not like that.
Johnson and Hoover are not on speak
ing terms. While Hiram goes bob
bing over the country scoring the
Coolidge administration, the presi
dent in turn appoints a Hooverite to
the cabinet. Mr. Wilbur himself is
returning to his first love, the navy;
he graduated from the Naval Acad
emy at Annapolis in 1888, and ought
to make a good man for his new job.
Yes, it begins to look like a third
party in 1924. Senator LaFollette
has passed out the word that he is
willing to head it if certain things
are not done by the Republican par
ty in its platform in Cleveland in
June. And you and I know right now
that the Republicans are not going
to do the bidding of Bob LaFollette
!n June or any other old month.
The Democrats can hardly contain
themselves over this announcement.
They may laugh too soon. They ought
to keep still until after the thing is
done, but they can’t do it. They are
immensely pleased over the outlook
and can’t conceal their attitude at
all, for they well remember that the
third party movement in 1912 was
what put Woodrow Wilson in the
White House and made a Democratic
administration possible. They seethe
same thing happening again to their
advantage. In this congress, LaFol
lette and his crowd unquestionably
hold the balance of power in both
branches, and a LaFollette revolution
this year may throw the November
election results into the house and
senate for settlement. Senator Mag

J. L. Stack Testifies
Before Oil Probers
nus Johnson, of Minnesota, is a La-
Follette follower, and he said on the
floor of the senate the other day that
he didn’t care what happened to the
Republican party. That so far as he
was concerned he would like to help
give the Republicans the licking of
their lives. That reflects the LaFol
lette sentment right now as it exists
in congress.
Bonus l’p to Coolidge
It is a well known fact that Presi
dent doesn’t like the idea of a bonus
baby being left on his front door step
one of these days, and he sees it com
ing up the White House driveway.
Congress seems to be the wet nurse
and the president is wondering what
to do with the thing when it arrives.
It is now thought in Washington that
if the president vetoes the bill as he
has indicated that he would, that
congress can muster up the necessary
strength to pass it over his veto.
Judging by the overwhelming vote
by which it passed the house 353 to
54. the house can make it jump the
veto all right, and presently we shall
see what the senate does with it.
The country is at that stage where
it is getting anxious as to what leg
islation this congress is actually go
ing to put through. There is the
taxation question, immigration and
hundreds of other good things yet in
the background and we are almost
p to the first of April. Perhaps con
gress is going to play an April fool
joke on us and get mighty busy next
month. There may be such a thing
as this congress becoming actually
fatigued at its own apparent idleness
in getting down to real legislative ef
forts and stop all this investigation
business that has consumed all the
time or the past three or four
months.
Georgia Needy Aided
By Members of Klan
Education of Two Small Girls Will
Continue Because of Klansmen
LAWRENCEVILLE, GA„ April I.
(Gwinnette County Journal) —Dis-
crediting the black reports that
have circulated about the Klan and
its members, Klansmen here are set
ting up an enviable record as friends
to the needy and seem to be always
ready with financial assistance for
those who need their help.
While around the fire was a widow
and six small children with no one
to earn their bread and clothes but
two small girls of school age, who
must give up the greatest of all
things—an education—to work for
the others, out of the darkness came
a number of white-robed figures, sup
posed to have been Klansmen and ex
tended to them a helping hand.
Mrs. Marlowe, a resident of Law
renceville. is a widow to whom the
Klansmen carried money.
On Saturday night a number of
white-robed men were seen to leave
Lawrenceville; it is understood these
men went to the aid of another wi
dow, a Mrs. Wilev, of near Gloters,
a widow who has had sickness in her
home for over two years, and who
has no means of support whatever.
These two are happier for having
received a visit from these commit
tee of men, which visits are but a
part of what has been done in this
manner in this vicinity in the last
few months, and it is generally un
derstood as the work of the some
times dreaded Ku Klux Klan.
Primary schools of the capital city

OF IMMIGRATION
Stickler Is 1910 or 1890 Cen
sus as Basis of Quota
Law Says Johnson
LAW EXPIRES JUNE 30
More Japanese Come to United
States Than Any Other Eng
lish-Speaking Nation
(Bureau of Publication aud Kdiirnt t»i> >
WASHINGTON. D. C., March 31.-
“The big fight coming in congress
next week is on the immigration
question,” declared Representative
Albert Johnson, of Washington state,
chairman of the house immigration
committee in a speech which he
broadcasted to the country last night
over the radio.
“Two main points will stand out in
that fight, viz., whether we shall he
governned by the 1890 census or the
1910 census in determing the quoto of
immigrants to be admitted,” contin
ued Mr. Johnson. “If we take the
1890 census there will be admitted to
the United States 180,000 persons per
year, while iif we have to adopt the
1910 census it will mean admitting
355,000 persons annually.
Percentage Tangle
“Then the other point which will
be fought will be whether the quota
shall be fixed at 2 per cent or 3 per
cent. I have always contended that
the United States cannot be forever
an asylum for Europeans who seek to
flock here in great numbers. I favor
the 2 per cent quota and the 1890
census and the majority of the house
committee feel the same way about
it, although, of course, there will be
a minority report on the matter
Which will have to be threshed out
on the floor of the house. I also
favor a strict examination of all ap
plicants overseas before they under
take to depart for this country.
“The present law expires on June
30 next. That is why we are pushing
for this new law to go into effect at
that time. If, by any chance, the
new law should not be made effective
then you will see the greatest influx
of immigrants this country has ever
known in its history. Such an influx
of immigrants would only be limited
to the carrying capacity of all
steamships plying the ocean, as the
pressure is terrific to come here.
“The house committee contends
that there is sufficient labor here
now to take care of the demand for
labor by manufacturers and others in
the employment line. There has been
no shortage of labor in recent years.
At any rate our gain in population
has been large; it has amounted to
10,000,000 in the last ten years. The
gain last year alone was over 1,500,-
000; and the last six months of last
year it amounted to over 500,000.
And of that number 120,000 people
came into the United States through
Canada alone.
Time to Call Halt
“Many of our states on the U. S.
receiving end of this problem are
being bunkoed and it is time to call
a halt. The great mass of immi
grants who came into this country
after 1890 was too great to be as
similated if individual liberty is to
endure. It must maintain a correct
basis.
“I claim that the 1890 law is not
discriminatory, if we are to look at
this thing in the interests of the peo
ple of the United States and why
should we not determine who we want
and how many we want of the people
seeking admission to our country?
Persons found to be ineligible for
citizenship should not be admitted.
“The United States acquired more
Japanese than any other English
speaking country in the world be
cause of that so-called ‘gentlemen’s'
agreement which has not worked out
to the interests of either country.
Former President Roosevelt’s mistake
ought to be rectified now. There is
no question.about that ‘gentleman’s’
agreement being broken by Japan.
That nation has not carried out its
provisions at all. Japan is the only
oriental country enjoying such spe
cial privilege and the Pacific coast
country is heartily sick and tired of
it.
“Much interest in the debate next
week is predicted on account of so
much religious feeling being worked
up about it and the feeling becoming
so in tense. I think we ought to
solve this problem by asking our
selves the question: ‘Who shall in
herit this land of our fathers? ”
The Rev. Thomas Rhondda Williams
of Brighton, England, who will sail

MacDonald, the British Prime Minis

that t is the great desire of the Labor
Party to know that, when it leaves
office, it has beeen able to draw the
American people nearer to the Brit
ish people, not for the purpose of di
viding the purpose of dividing the
material spoils of the world between
them, but as partners in establishing
peace and good will on earth.
Paul and Minneapolis could teach it

enterprises, and the people are get

so-called lawmakers was made.”

PROBE DROPPED ONCE
Read Correspondence Into Rec
ord Between Federal Depart
ments and Creager
(Bureau of Publication and (education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 31.
R. B. Creager, of Brownsville. Texas,
Republican national committeeman
for the Lone Star 3tate, who pro
poses to fight the Ku Klux Klan in
both national conventions and have
inserted planks in both national
platforms declaring against the Klan,
now has a warm fight on hands try
ing to shield and protect himself and
his Almo Land and Sugar company
before a senate subcommittee of the
committee on post office and post
roads of the senate.
Mr. Creager and his company stand
charged by Senator Heflin, of Alaba
ma, and others with having defraud
ed mafiy persons during a period of
years out of money through the sale
of land in Cameron and Hildalge
counties, Texas, in the Rio Grande
valley.
Mr. Creager also stands charged by
Senator Heflin with being instrumen
tal through conferences here with of
ficials of the postoffice department
and the department of justice in hav
ing an investigation of the alleged
frauds dropped. Senator Heflin is
being assisted in his role of “prose
cutor" by James R. Page, of Kansas
City, Mo., an attorney who has in
vestigated the matter and also by a
number of postal officials who are to
give testimony.
Voluminous correspondence be
tween the postoffice and justice de
partments and their field branches
and between federal officials in
Washington and individuals outside
who were interested in the several
development companies in the Rio
Grande valley were read into The
Record. These dealt mostly with ef
forts made in 1921 and 1922 to ob
tain a “continuance” of cases pend
ing in Kansas City against the W. E.
Stewart company and with the suc
cessful move of R. B. Creager, Re
publican national committeeman for
Texas, to have the investigation
which was being made into the Ala
mo Land and Sugar company by a
postal inspector from tne Kansas
City district transferred to the jur
isdiction of some other agent.
Mr. Creager charged that J. M.
Donaldspn, the inspectator who
started the inquiry, was prejudiced,
and Creager used his influence to
have the case taken away from him
and given to a Philadelphia man. Be
ginning in October, 1921 soon after
Mr. Creager and other land company
officials nad called at the postoffice
to ask, according to tesetimony, that
no action be taken until the new in
spector had completed his investiga
tion, the correspondence covered a
period of some four months.
When Attorney Page told the com
mittee about the inquiry being drop
{>ed Mr. Creager was at once on his
eet with hot protest.

for the Ku Klux Klan, Realm of West

great Amercan organizaton and its
prnciiples

ALLEGED DUPLICATION OF GOVERNMENT
BONDS TO BE INVESTIGATED BY HOUSE
(Bureau of Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 31.
The house of representatives has or
dered an investigation by a special
committee of the Brewer charges re
garding duplication of bonds and
other negotiable government paper
at the bureau of engraving and
printing.
The house passed the Snell resolu
tion, which is a substitute for the
King resolution, ordering that this
investigation shall be made by a
special committee of five members
to be appointed by the speaker.
Chairman Snell told the house that
he had consulted with Secretary Mel
lon who advised him that the govern
ment had not lost any money by. du
plication of bonds, but that he favor
ed the investigation in order that the
entire controversy which had de
veloped into a scandal might be
cleaned up.
Representative Watkins, Demo
crat, of Oregon, questioned whether
this special committee would go in
to the summary dismissal of officials
at the bureau of engraving and
printing by order of the late Presi
dent Harding. Chairman Snell re
plied that an inquiry into the dis
missals was not necessarily contem
plated in the resolution.
Representative Garrett, of Ten
nessee, minority leader, explained
that if in the investigating the du
plication of bonds the trail led
across that of the dismissals from
the bureau so that the subject be
came Interwoven, the investigating
committee had authority to inquire
into the question of dismissals.
Chairman Snell agreed with this in
terpretation and others argued for a
real investigation that would clarify
the matter.
The investigation ought to also go
on and disclose the purpose and the
Visit to Klan Robe
Factory Interesting
THOSE who have never visited the
Klan robe factory in Buckhead,
Georgia, have missed a most
fascinating and enlightening sight.
Not only are Klansmen welcomed,
but all interested persons are invited
to visit the factory and see the much
talked-of Klan robes in the making.
And their time will not be wasted.
Over 10,000 yards of cloth go into the
making of 1150 robes daily. It is
an example of the perfect co-ordina
tion of effort that has made the Klan
the most talked-of organization of
all time.
The factory’s motto is, “Twenty
four hours service.” And that motto
is no idle threat. They are working
night and day to maintain a surplus
of 20,000 robes—and doing it. But
it has proven no easy task. It has
been found necessary to install ev
ery conceivable modern appHance to
keep up the required output and, at
the same time, to put tne cost of
robes to individual Klans, at as low
a figure as possible.
The factory will probably be in
stalled in its new three-story build
ing within the next 30 days. The ad
ditional room should relieve the pres
sure of maintaining this production.
At that time the old building will
be utilized entirely for the Klan

SENATOR REED OUT OF

Trimming Received at Hands of

(Bureau of Publication and (education)
WASHINGTON, D. C.. March 31.
Senator James A. Reed, of Missouri,
has announced that he will not ask
his Democratic state convention to
support him for the Democratic
presidential nomination and neither
will he ask the convention to confer
any favors upon him whatever. The
trimming he received at the hands
of his own voters takes him out of
the presidential race this year.
“I expect to abide by the decision
of the people of Missouri rendered
at the August primaries,” he said,
“and to heartily support our ticket.”
Senator Reed said that when he
asked the Missouri Democratis to in
dorse him as a presidential candidate
he “had hoped no considerable anta
gonism or bitterness would be
aroused,” but these expectations
“were not realized.”
He urged platform planks reaffirm

of civil and religious liberty and de

Managers and employees of both
