People's Party Platform
1. We demand, a ntional cur
rency, safe, sound and flexible, is
sued by the general goveirunent
only, a full lehal tender for all debt
public and private, and that with
out the use of banking corpora
tions ; a just, equitable and efficient
means of distribution, direct to the
people, at a tax not exceeding 2 per
cent, be provided, as set forth in
the sub-treasury plan of the Farm
ers' Alliance, or some better system
also by payments in discharge of
its obligations for public improve
menots.
a. We demand free and unlimit
ed coinage of silver and gold at the
present legal ratio oft 16 to 1.
b. We demand that the amounn
of -circulating mtediumin be speedily
increased to not less than $04) I-er
capita.
c. We demand a graduated in
come tax.
d. We believe that the money
of the country should be kept as
much as possible iin the hands o,
the people, and hence we demand
that all State and national revenue
shall be limited to the necessary
expenses of the government, eco
nouically and honestly administer
ed.
e. We demand that postal sav
ings banks be established by the
government for the safe deposit of
the earnings of the people and to
facilitate exchange.
2. Transportation being a means
of exchange and public necessity,
,the government should own and
operate the railroads in the inter
est of the people.
p. The telegraph and telephore,
like the poet office system, being a
necessity for the transportation of
news, should be owned and opera
ted by the government in the in
terest of the people.
3. The land, including all the
national resources of wealth, is the
heritage of all the people, and
should not be monopolired for spec
ulative purposes, and alien owner
ship of land should be prohibited.
All land now aeld by railroads and
other corporations in excess of
their actual needs, and all lands
now owned by aliens, should be re
elimned by the government and
held no: actual settlers only.

ing at any time, than the cost of
the silver bullion and the standard
dollars coined therefrom, then held
in the Treasury. Therefore, these
dollars must either be held in the
Treasury or paid out for coin notes
which must be cancelled. They
are not wanted for the redemption
of coin notes, and, therefore, they
will be held in the Treasury. The
Secretary of the Treasury is con
sequently incurring the expense of
changing a certain amount of sil
ver bullion into the form of coin.
There is certainly no objection to
coining this silver. For my past,
I wish it were all coined and the
coin notes all redeemed with it, for
there would then be none to be re
deemed in gold. The money vol
ume, however, would not thereby be
at all increased. But if these dol
lars, coined in 1894, are being used
on the stump, as is claimed, to
prove to the people that silver is
itill being coined and the currency
volume thereby increased, it is
downright deception; that is all
there is to it.
What have you to say about the
statement of the volume of money
in circulation put out on the first
of each month i
I have simply to say that they
are official misstatements of facts.
This may seem to be a broad user
tion, but it is no more than those
who maske up these statements well
know and would doubtless, private
ly admit. There is no such volume
of money in circulation in this
country as is contained in these
statements; nor is there any such
volume of money in the country at
all, ad those who make up these
statements know this perfectly well.
For instance, they give as the vol
um e of greenbacks still in exis
tmes, 8,681st,0o. They do not
admit thtt there Ims been a single
note burned up, detroyed or lost
in y way during the war or sice.
The sem e is true of ati e l bak
ot. ad oft other Srs of paper
aurm ey. They rSe albo thet
*ry tr atieaal pies. et silver
coined since 1553, $21,0o0,)00 of
which were coined before the war,
alhnost every piece of which left
the country during the war, has all
co,me back and is now in circula
tion! But worse than this is the
reported stock of gold in the coun
try. According to the treasury
statement for January last, there
was $66,(6K1(Wk) of gold, coin and
bullion, in the country, of which
$5863,000,ol( was in the banks
and in the hands of the people.
But the gold holdings of the banks
altogether. according to the last
full bank report up to that date,
was only $175,(N)0,000, leaving as
in actual circulation, in the pock
ets of the people in the tills of
merchants, etc.. $411,(N,O(000 in
gold, or $i per capita in gold ac
tually in the hands of the people!
Now the treasury officials do not
claim to have any evidence what
ever of the existence of any such
stock of gold coin in circulation
nor of half of it, and yet they put
this statement out without any ex
planation as if it were the truth.
All in the world they have to show
for it is an estimate made years
ago by director of the mint. Burch
ard, which was merely a guess to
begin with, and to this they have
added imports and production, and
deducted exports without attempt
ing to give the amount of gold
that has gone into the melting pot,
or that has been carried out of the
country by Americans traveling
abroad or by Chinese laborers re
turning home. Hence, the black
faced figures in these reports, claim
ing to show monthly the true per
capita circulation, to say the least,
are culpably deceptive.
Secretary Foster, a few years
ago, put out a statement of the
volume of circulation at the close
of the war, which contradicted the
statement of every secretary made
during the war, or within ten years
subsequent to the close of the war,
and yetthis oficial misinformation
is till repeated from time to time
by the present secretary. This
sort of information given to the
public as true and reliable has been
tolerated about as long as it ought
to be.
What have you to say about the
estimate of the production of gold
for 1493, by the present director
of the mint.
Well, the present director of the
mint seems to be about as accom
modating as the Indiana school
master, who said he would teach
that the world was round or flat,
just as they preferred. Mr. Pres
ton was made director of the mint
to make estimates and get up sta
tistics for the gold trust, and he
has proved a faithful servant to
them. I see he estimates the total
production of gold for the world
last year to be $155,000,000 which
comes up to the production of 1853,
the largest ever reported before.
But in order to make this out he
raises the estimate of almost every
body else, especially where figures
are not perfectly certain, and re
stores the estimated production of
China of $8,000,000, which his
predecessor, Mr. Leach, dropped
out after an investigation which
showed to him that it had no foun
dation. Mr. Preston in order to
get this $8.000,,000 for China,
which nobody else knows anything
about, assumes that all the gold
taken into or sent to China by Chi
nese gold diggers from all parts of
the world has all remained in Chi
na, and that therefore China's ex
poTts of gold must have been pro
duced within the limits of China
itself. Del Mar makes the pro
duction of gold for 1893 $182,000,
000, but I am inclined to think that
this is an under estimate. With
out going into details, my own judg
ment is that the production of last
year reached something like $140,
000,000. This increase came large
ly from the gold fields of South
Africa, where gold is found under
exceptional conditions in conglom
erates, as diluvial gold. That there
has been a great stimulus to the
production of gold in recent years
,rte y Y
there is no 'loul,t: Iit that this ex
cessive plrtoduction of ,gold can be
kept up for any con.i(eralle length
of time no complxetent geologist he
lieves.
Prof. Suess, in a very positive
umanner reatffirms in his recent tes
timony before the (Germ:an Silver
('ommission, his previous state
ments as to the certain decline in
the production of gold in the near
future.
MIr. Preston has also redlucel
the estimate of gold consumpltion
in the arts. without any data what
ever to base it on. from i5,s5. NI,
INH) down to $5S ,oon,,1l n,. 'T'hese
things show so plainly that these
estimates are nmadle to serve a pur
pose, that they become worthies.

Workinzmen's Party.
The following was furnished for
publication yesterday:
"I have noticed the statement of
the Board of Supervisors in the
press of this city, claiming that
the Independent Workingmen's po
litical party is an adjunct to the
Republican party, and I wish to
stamp the utterance as a falsehood,
gotten up for the purpose of in
juring myself and associates in this
movement. We are as much a
bona fide party as any who have
ever asked for representation. I
also find that we will have to prove
"to the satisfaction of the board
that we are a legitimate party, but
we are also told at the same time
that a private individual has the
right to petition for a representa
e tive at the polls. We can show,
and if we are not counted out on
election day, will prove, that we
are not as small a faction or club
as is now spoken of by this board.
e This is an honest move on the part
n of the working people of the First
it Congressional District to send a
representative to Congress who
e will secure legislation that will re
d dound to their benefit. They have
r tried both parties for years and
found them wanting, and now that
e they are trying to follow the ad
_ vice given them for years by the
)l press-to resort to the ballot box
h for the amelioration of their con
, dition, instead of strikes and blood
shed-they are confronted with an
It obstacle in the shape of the Board
I of Supervisors telling them they
e think that they represent nothing
o that is bona fide.
il "The Independent Workingmen's
d political party have not considered
h who they were injuring in this mat
1, ter, and it will be clearly demon
. strated on the 6th of November
e that we care less. The board it
self acknowledges that they have
Is discovered names on our list pre
- sented to them who have always
f been good Democrats. That is
isvery true, and if they will inves
d tigate they will find that I have
h never voted any other ticket but
I- the Democratic ticket in my life:
o but I, along with the workingmen
I, of this city, have concluded that
g the Independent Workingmen's po
d litical party, if successful, will
i- benefit our cause a great deal more
f than either of the old parties.
i- "In conclusion of the above
C- facts, and fearing that perhaps we
- may be ignored by this board, I
a wish to give notice to my friends
- and the general public that these
,- false and malicious statements will
it not deter this cause of the work
I- ingmen in the First Congressional
r- District, but will keep up the good
at work that has been started, even
,- though we be unable to prove 'to
- the satisfaction of the board' that
i we are entitled to Our rights as
!r American citizens; that is, that we
- are a legitimate party; and in con
1e elusion will state that on the morn
oe ing of the 7th we will prove to the
l stisfaction of all honest citizens
that the workingmen intend to bo
recognized In the near future by
casting their votes to suit them
selves, irreslec(tA, e aof .onsepquen

EDITOR POPULIST:
I think if Mr. Brian would come
down into this country he could
get a great many subscribers for
your paper. Maj. M. R. Wilson
spoke in our town to a large an(l
attentive audience. There was
people from all over the parish
here. The Major held his audience
spell bound for more than two
hours, and even the old line I)em
ocrats expressed( themselves as well
pleased. The People's party is
gaining ground rapidly every day
in this part of the State, and if .,';
just had the speakers here tilp the
election, we would roll up a won
derful vote. Tell Mr. Brian if he
can come down here and make us a
few speeches, I will arrange the
first appointment about the 27th,
at Amite City. If he can come let
me hear from you at once.
Yours for reform,

Must Withdraw His Name or Re
sign His Position.
C'HEYENNE, Wyo., Oct. 17.---J.
F. P'ierce, candidate for State Aud
itor of the People's party ticket,
has been notified by George L.
Black, assistant superintendent of
the Union P'acife Coal Company.
that he must either withdraw fronm
the ticket or leave the employ of
the company. The order, it is
said, comes from the receivers of
I the road.
The law of the State makes it an
offense, punishable by a fine of
I $100 to $500 for any individual or
I corporation to interfere with their
Semployes, or in any way prevent
tthem from becoming candidates
a for office.
Chairman Merritt has decided to
serve notice upon the coal compa
ny not to violate this law, and will
- offer a reward of $1000 for the
Sconviction of any person guilty of
a such violation.
