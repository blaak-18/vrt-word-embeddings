Throw Stones at 8treet Car, Badly
Wrecking the Same.
MOTORMAN MAY DIE.
A Large Majority of the Men Are
French (anadians and They Have
the Sympathy of That Por
tion of Community.
Montreal, Feb. 7.-Rioting by strik
ing employes of the Montreal street
railway and their sympathizers began
early yesterday.
A car was wrecked in less than two
hours after a mass meeting held after
midnight, at which the action of the
union in ordering a general strike was
endorsed.
More than 1000 street railway em
ployes attended the meeting. and an
equal number of their friends waited
outside the hall to hear the result of
their delibcrations The news that aý
general strike had been declared wa
received with three cheers, and the
strikers, accompanied by their friends,
marched toward the different car barns
shouting and singing. A large crowd
assembled at the head of the barn in
Cote street. The word was passed
around tha* a car was running on one
of the principal srre' ts The crowd of
strikers and friends went to meet it
When the car reached Comer street it
was met with a volley of stones. The
motor nan was roughly handled and
forced to leave the car. The mob
hurled stones and bricks at the car,
completely wrecking it.
A hurry call was sent for the police.
A patrol wagon was loaded with offi
cers and dispatched to the scene of the
riot, but before they arrived the crowd
dispersed and there was no further
trouble at that point.
Later, a motorman who attempted to
run a car out of the barn was assault
ed and so badly injured that in all
probability he will die.
The majority of the strikers are
French Canadians, and have the sym
pathy of that portion of the commun
ity. It is said between 1000 and 1500
men are out.
NO STRIKE.
Allen Says Katy's Differences With Her
Men Have Been Settled.
St. Louis, Feb. 7.-Vice President
and General Manager Allan of the
Missouri, Kansas and Texas is consid
ering the request of the 1000 conduc
tors and trainmen of the road for an
increase of wages of 15 per cent. .
Just before General Manager dard
ing of the Missouri Pacific went home
the Missouri Pacific grievance com
mittee waited on Mr. Harding de,
manding 15 per cent.
Grand Master Morrissey of the
trainmen and Assistant Chief Garrett
son of the conductors have-issued a
statement to the public. They say the
men voted for an increase of pay to
20 per cent, and. with that authority
the concession was made, the great
est ever made by men similarly situat
ed. The concession was reduced to
15 per cent, the Missouri Pacific made
an offer of 11 2-3 per cent increase
and the Missouri Kansas and Texas
of 11 1-2. The address says:
"We are not altogether ignorant of
'the fact a refusal will cause a shrink
ing of values in railway securities in
one day that more than equals the
amount necessary to meet the increas
'ed cost of operating involved for a
period of years and that itf it should
embrace any great extent of mileage.
Wall street will be the proper place
to consult the financial barometer and
an obstinate refusal may serve as the
best corrective that has yet been
so popular .of late and for which a
legal mtedy has- been vainly sought.
Frotn Sitt to last we have given full
coesideratie- to the rights of others
and If the aWbllc cannot accept the
baiaing that all the obligation lies on
to comseere the itterest of both,
e- propose. that others 1hall bear
ther share of the white man's bur
den."
General Manager Allen of the Mis
sonrit Kansas and Texas railroad
stated ' ltat the differences between
his company a nd the tralamen had
been settled and that there would be
n~t strike.

to The Hague So Regarded.
Washington, Feb. 7.-In -enezuelan
administration andediplomatic circles
the reference of the questions to The
Hague is regarded as a victory for
Minister Bowen as Venezuela thereby
is enabled to recover from the dis
tressing effect of the blockade before
starting upon the payment of her
debts. The cumbersome machinery of
The Hague, it is expected, will delay
matters considerably and the pay
ment of creditor nations cannot begin
until the important question of prior
ity payment for the allies is decided.
The finding of The Hague tribunal
may not be handed down for several
months. The tribunal also will decide
the vital question to South American
states as to whether blockades and
bombardments entitle powers to pre
ferential treatment at the hands of
their debtor. Coming from The Hague
it will establish a precedent while a
decision on the point from President
Roosevelt would have carried no such
weight as decisive of a point of in
ternational law.
Consildered l,,osed.
London. Feb. 7-At the foreign office
it was said that the officials regarded

OPEN D!SCUSSION.
For a While it Looked Like There W'ould
He No Executive Sessiou.
Washington, Feb. 7.-For a time in
the senate it looked as though the
question of the construction of an
isthm.an canal would be discussed
openly. Mr. Morgan spoke on his res
olution, introduced Thursday, calling
on the secretary of the navy for cor
respondence regarding the military oc
cupation of bay of Panama and Col
on. He explained the object of the
resolution, and said if adopted, it
would prove or disprove all allegations
made in the press that the time of the
settlement of the insurrection the gov
ernment of Colombia had proposed it
should pay the insurrectors $3.000,000
for peace, the money to betaken from
that obtained from the United States
for the isthmian canal concessions. He
.declared that .no organized govern
ment existed in Colombia but that it
was under a dictator. He read from
the correspondence leading up to the
negotiation of a canal treaty and said
that in the opinion of the president
a satisfactory bill could be given by
Colombia and an agreement had been
reached fixing a price of $7,000,000
and $250,000 per annum. Senate final
ly went into executive session.

Rock Island will share control of the

It Is Brittbh Aa1bsesador's Fault Nege
tiatlons Were BrokenOff.
Washington, Feb. 7.-Confirmation
of the London dispatch Thursday to
the effect that Mr. Bowen and the Brit
ish ambassador at an interview Mon
day had a somewhat heated argument
obtained here. Indeed, it is stated
that should the character of the ca
blegrams that the British ambassador
has been sending to his government
regarding the attitude of Minister
1,owen became public the country
would be furnished with sensational
diplomatic incidents.
It is the opinion of Venezuelan me
gotiators other than the British am
bassador that the latter is directly re
sponsible for the abrupt breaking off
of negotiations with Mr. Bowen.
It is the opinion in official circles
here that Minister Bowen has an ab
solute right in acting for Venezuela to
object to President Roosevelt's acting
as arbitrator. To do so would cause
pain to Bowen, whose admiration for
Roosevelt is well known, but he feels
obliged to keep wee' in mind the fact
that, he is here not as an American.
but as the representative of Venezuela.
The British ambassador's conduct
has resulted in several impertinent de
tails of the momentous conference
laking out. 'and these now substntia
ted by other negotiators present. It
seems that when the British ambassa
dor. who took the lead at this confer
ence, had finished reading the cable
gram of I.ord Lansdowne containing
his last proposition for 20 and 10 per
cent division of custom receipts of
Porto Cabello and Laguayra between
the allies and other claimant nations
respectively, Mr. Bowen at once re
markld in emphatic tones' that the
proposition was but another scheme to
trick Venezuela into abetting an
alliance against her for six years and
probably longer. He added that he
would not consent to any scheme for
continuing the triple alliance one day
longer than he was forced to.
The diplomat stated afterwards: "It
was Mr. Bowen who exploded the
bombsnell the moment the- prposition
was made."
Herbert is said to have cabled Lon
don that he would no longer deal with
Bowen.
Italian and German ministers say
Bowen treated all courteously.
"Mr. Bowen must stand up for Ven
ezuela," said the Italian and German
ambassadors. "If he did not he would
forfeit our respect."
Herbert received, it is stated, , the
past few hours, a tart cablegram from
Lanadowne. It informed him he was
at Washington to obey orders.
