MRS. BLYSIER'S ROMANCE, t.
Mr.'. Stiuff' h atrdling qsitll was a
high builtling and it, stooad on a hill. o
Mly room was il its third-story, and I t'
had often sat -looking out over the
city from its "sightly" windows (as b
i'oggy, the maid, c li.-d them.). The f
hill was nearly 'cnical in eshape and 84
terraced on two siles, my side being b
one of Ihem. At the foot of the hill A
ran a broad, hianbdsome street, and ft
on a prominent corner of this street, it
in plain sight from mly windows, stood b
a lrge, rambling old mansion, about A
which we girls had woven many ad
romance. We wondered who lived
there. Ladles and geutlemnen pro- P
menadrll through its pleasant if
grounds; carriuges rolled up to its R
wide gateway many times every day; u
professional-lookin r gentlemen went
in and out of It. What could it be ? I
One day I found out. There was a
great excitement that day in Mrs. ti
Sims' boarding-school. I had been
feeling ill for some days. My head
ached and my tongue was dry and G
hot. The doctor said at last that I
had the scarlet fever and must be a
removed at once. ,"Better take her ti
"home," he said. She Isn't fairly ti
sick yet." o
"Home!" groaned Mrs. Sims. a
"Doctor, she lives to India!" a
"Good gracious!" said the doctor,
and he scratched his head thought- ,
fully. At last he said: "I have it I!
Here's Dr. Dolby's hospital right
down here just the place for her." 1
So 1 was wrapped up and driven to y
"Dr. Dolby's hospital," which prov- 1
ed to be no other than the dear, ramb- s
ling, romantic old house whi3b, with a
its widly overgrown but delightful b
shrubbery, bhad so long been the ob. ,i
ject of our speculations.
They put we to bed in a largee t
quiet room. The open fire lookedJ
wonderfully pleasant. A quaint, old.
fashioned tea service, with cherubs v
and gillyflowers and various other a
incongruous designs on it in blue, I
sat appetizingly on the round table P
at my bedside Three or four easy.
habars were mingled among the d
otherse, and in one of them, after I ft
was nicely "tucked up" and ready to M
go to sleep, I beheld-yawning al- a
ready and casting wishful eyes to. d
ward her own white eot near by-my I
buxom nurse. Mrs. Blyster, who had
been engaged expressly for me. .
How fat and good-natured she look- "
ed And how the white cot creak
ed when she finally sought repose!
The next morning I was worse, and
for several days I tossed in delirium I
and pain, but by a week more the '
fever began to abate and Mrs. Blya
ter said, reassuringly:
"You haln't 'dead yet, miss, and 1
what's more you haln't a goin to be
-not with Sarah Blyster to see to
ye!" Then good Barah Byster gave
me a motherly kiss on y Ifathead, 3
fumbled over my alreG. painfully
tucked in bed clothing in an attempt 1
to express still more foroebly her af
feetionate zeal for my welfare, and I
sat down with a sort of good-natured 1
grunt at the back window.
I closed my eyes and was justl
about falling asleep when I was
aroused by a half-suppressed sob
"What's the matter ?" I said, faint- t
ly. To see happy Mrs. Blyster In a
tears was too much for me.
"She's dead miss; the woman 't f
lives In the little house back, They're '
a havin' her funeral this blessed t
.minute."
"A friend of yours ?" I was Im- I
,rmsed almost to tears myself by s
prh Blyster's manner. 9
"Law, no!" slid that lady, strt- e
lag up and assuming her own radiant :
countenance again. "And what I'm I
a whinln' around here and givin' her I
the blues for, I'm sure I don't know.
Cheer Up, Barah Blyjrster, cheer upt" I
I smiled falintly and sono dropped I
off into the nap whichlob Mrs. Blyster's a
sob bad interrupted.

this "crusher" Mrs. Blysetr went il
out to take my tray. I
The next lay the doctor sent her ra
Sout to take a walk and she came in

"I went by the front o' that little
house, you know, where she died a pi
fornnit ago. Jest as clean, you never es

bed the steps and front theirselves. ai
An'such a nice raw carpet on the de
front room floor, an' the clock a tick- p
in' on the mantlehoelf. My! it must
he awful lonesome without her!" Ic
And Mrs. Blyster drew her face "
down dolefully.
Ah, lta Mrs. Blyster's heart was al
getting enlisted. The dear old house, c
if it was only a hospital, was not m
going to be without its romance B
after all. o
"He goes to his shop every morn- a
in' "said Mrs. Blyster, irrelevantly, di
as she brigtened up the fire a day or al
two later. tc
"Be ? Who?' I asked, stupidly.
Mrs. Blyster started like a child ai
caught at the cookies.
"I jest see that man over there," p1
and she nodded in the direction of ri
the back window. "I see him split- w
tin' some kiln'lins an' then a goin' T
off to his work. I rayther guess he's
a earpenter, but mebbe its a mason, le
or mebbe itsa shoemaker." a
"Sure enough!" I rejoined. "But
what difference does it make to you,
Mrs. Blveter ?"
"Iaw L" said Mrs. Blyster, brid
ling; "you haven't no nlaterest in
your fellowbeln's. Now here's a
poor man, as likely a man as rvye
seen this many a long day, gone and
a-lost his wife-the derest oreetur to
him prob'ly In the world." And it
Mrs. Blyster'es voice choked up.
"And yon haven't no more iympa.
thy with him than nothin' in the ti
world."
There was an eloquence of re- ti
proach in this which quite silenced d
me-though I feebly protested my i
innocence-and the suueot was drop- o
pod,
eunday however, was the grand o
day for irs. Blyster's observation,
for then the "inexpressive he"-it b
was a real trial to her that she did n
not know his name-was at home All ti
day. She speculated on his name a ti
graed deal. e
.".There's a beris' about his tnlea," c
samid that lady with some sentiment, o
"thatesms to sorter show he haln't 1l
got no common name; bow I know o
he haln't got no name like Smith." a
"I'm afraid we never shall know,"
I said, quberly; "I'm getting well v
1es you bo!" said the good soul, b
giving mean affectionate hug. "Yes to
you be; an' I'm glad enough If it do
Iput me out of a Job. But likely the
doctor '11 get me here aain." I
"Oh, yes!" I said; 'but what do a
you think that man's name is now ?"
Mrs. Blyster returned to the sub- a
Sjest with evident alacrity. I
"Likely 'talnt nothin' like Per- e
klas ?" she said, nlaterrogatively. t
The Perkines were a great family, 1
who lived near by in a grand man- l
slob.
"You know I haven't seen him," b
I said, half ashamed of drawing out h
the dear, old eature Just for my a
own amusement. "Perhape it might a
be Crippen." The Crippen's lived ti
further down the street and, though b
not so aristocratl as the Perkinaes, a
had still eaims to ooasuderation a
''That just about suits him," said b
good Mrs. lyster, with some epthu I
siasm. "r. Orpen i ThatMsonds d

I couldnat hel lauIghiag. "Mr, a

Something Is my manner quite In- a

"But what's his name ?" I inter. dA
