COTTON IS AWAY UP.
THu4 FARMERS SHOULD NOT
HOWL ANY MORE.

Downfall of the People's Party. IBut

()n every side we hear our Demo
tratic friends trying to hoodoo the
od farmer about the over-production
chbsuut. Cotton has gone way up
and knocked the props from under all
Populist doctrine. We would like to
see an honest. sensible Democrat who
will say the price of cotton is -.way
up". The price is not .'way up.'
Eight or nine cents is not a high
price; it is only a moderate price
when we have a good crop.
We heard a lawyer say., 'the pres
ent price of cotton is a Jonah to the
Populist:; they are sure dead now
their arguments all out of date; they
won't be in it anymore." Now, this
lawer, though a Democrat. is a good
honest man, but his zeal for his party
and his contempt for the People's
party has led him to make some pe
culiar assertions. Now, Mr. Lawyer,
we will suppose you are a farmer. Of
course it is hard to suppose a lawyer a
farmer, but here goes anyway. You
begin about Christmas to plow and
prepare to grow a crop of cotton.
You fed your horses all the hay and
corn you raised last year and went in
debt for a little more. You bought
all your floor, coffee, sus~ar, etc., on
credit, Clothes-well, you wore your
old ones just the same as you have
been doing and your wife and the
girls worked early and late chopping
cotton, and later on picking cotton.
They wore rags because last year you
raised too much cotton. Your daugh
ters stayed at home on Sunday, because
if they went to church they would be
snubbed by the daughter of the city
lawyer, who wore nice clothes. Your
wife not only did not have decent
clothes to wear to church Sunday,
but she was not able to go; her back
was almost broken from dragging the
cotton sack up and down the rows all
week. At last you have got your cot
ton all picked and thanks to provi.
dence, you have no overproduction
this year. You gota whole bale from
six acres and you sold the bale for the
big price of $42, and you have twenty
acres, and, at i7 an acre you get $140
for your entire crop. Twenty acres
for you and your wife and two grown
daughters is a good big field for you
to cultivate in cotton.
Every lawyer in this or any other
town will admit that one dollar a day
is a small sum to feed and clothe a
family of five, but then you don't
wear much and you eat less. so your
expenses for an entire year would only
be $66. No lawyer and his family
could live on that amount, but you
are a farmer and you can.
Well you got 0140 for your crop.
Good price for cotton, you say, and to
town you come to pay your debts.
You pay out the $140 and still owe
#g26. You sever paid your taxes and
did not get the old woman a new
dress or any shoes for the girls.
You have nothing to eat, no clothes
to wear and winter starlng you in the
faoe. The merchant won't credit you
for anything, because you have not
paid him the one-half you already
owe.
SNow. Mr. Lawyer, do you think
yen got a big prloe for your cotton?
No, you don't think it, and the man
who tells you so is either a fool or a
oasamate politiooal fraud, his ka
guage is as Ialt to you and the poor
woman and girls who tolled, starved
and west half clad to raise that little
me.sley crop of 8-eoot cttona.-Pitte

WINO PAT'S WEDDING.
A Notable Function in High Chinese
Soeety in San Francisco.
Wing Fat, a well-kno-.n member of
the Chinese colony, wae married at 5
o'clock Sunday morning to Miss Mow
Sing Yu, niece of Li Hoy fHung, presi
dent of one of the Six Companies. Last
night the bride and groom entertained
their friends at dinner at the Hank
Fer Low restaurant on Dupont street.
Some 200 Chinese and between thirty
and forty ladies and gentlemen were
present. The bride is a demure little
Chinese woman, just 18 years of age.
She is but a recent arrival in San
Francisco, having come from her Ori
ental home to marry Mr. Fat, who is
the foreman for Louis Meyerstein &
Co., and is worth over $100,000, says
San Francisco Examiner. There were
but few at the wedding, and the pecu
liar Chinese ceremony was performed
in one of the temples of the Six Con.
panies. When the bridal company ai
rived at the restaurant last night there
was a great display of colored lightu
and a perfect fusillade of bombs and
firecrackers. The banquet room was
decorated in brilliant colors and aglow
with the light of many Chinese lan
terns. The white guests were seated
at a different table from the Chinese,
and at the table where the latter were
seated the groom presided with his
bride. Mrs. Fat had on a light green
silk costume trimmed with gold bro
cade and many precious stones. The
groom was arrayed in a silk suit suit
able to his rank and fortune. The menu
was most elaborate and there was
nothing to mar the festivities of the
evening in the least. The white guests
enjoyed the affair as much as any who
were present, and the groom was fully
equal to the occasion, both in the dig
nity of his bearing and the mannner
in which he welcomed the guests in.
true Oriental style. After the Chi-'
nese fashion, the speechmaking and the
popping of champagne corks openedI
up the wedding dinnner. Li Hoy Hung,
the bride's uncle, made addresses both
in Chinese and English. A Chinese ,
dinner of choice and rare dishes was
then served. But these many and va- 1
ried courses did not conclude the repast
for to the surprise of many of the Chi
nese and white guests a dinner cooked
and served in the American style fol
lowed. .Each lady in the party was
presented by the bride with a fan, a
pair Of ivory chopsticks and a Chinese
bracelet. Every gentleman received as
a memento of the occasion a handsome
pipe. At the conclusion of the dinner
the guests repaired to one of the Chi
i nese theaters, where a performance by
Chinese children was in progress for
the entertainment of Mr. and Mrs. Fat.
The latter and their relatives to
gether with all the white guests, occu
pied boxes and seats on the stage.

BEAUTIES OF OUR PRESENT i
BOND SYSTEM.
Mew American and Foreign Bankers are
Sapping the Existence of the People cl
Through the Corrupt RLulings and g
Practices of Democratic Officials
By the 1st of October the time dur
ing which the Rothschild bond-syndi
cate hired itself to the government
to keep our gold reserve in repair will
have expired. ii
Then what will we do:
Rotchschild and among 'em charg
ed us only $1),000).Il, to keep our
gold reserve in repair from February ti
to October.
The time will soon be out and our
gold reserve will need more carpen- r,
try. Will it take ten more millions
to repair it eight more months? tl
And will it take ten more millions t
another eight months after that?
We had to borrow the money to pay
the first ten millions. We will have a
to borrow the money to pay the next n
ten millions, and so on from term to c,
tterm. e
What will the end be?
Sixty-seven million of people, worth w
$60,000,000,000, sold to a dozen or so ii
bankers, and bound hand and foot by c
a written contract drawn up by the tl
president's law partner. That's the t1
situation'
Are you proud of a gov'ernment o
which thus sells its people? u
Are you certain of your future lib
erties when you can thus be handed a
over to the servitude of an insolent b
syndicate of bankers?
It needs no prophet to tell your fu- e
ture. 8i
On and after October 1st the Wall ti
streeters will begin to raid your gold ri
reserve once more. a
SThe treasury notes of 1890, issued b
to pay for silver bullion which bullion
the law said should be coined in sulf- i
cient quantities to redeem said treas- b
ury notes, will be carried to the treas- y
ury by the raiders. They will de- tl
mand geld for said treasury notes. ti
The law says they can only demand a
*'coin." Cleveland says that "coin" a
means gold, only. o
Therefore the men whom the law
contemplated as getting silver dollars
in exchange for the notes issued to jl
pay for the silver, will get all gold
and no silver. Then the government
having paid out gold where the law c
contemplated silver, finds itself short
on gold. e
The raiders have taken out the gold k
with the silver purchase notes.
The government having paid out f,
the gold, must get it back again-else I
our precious gold reserve would r
shrink.
A "shrinkage" of our precious t
gold reserve cannot be thought of f,
without a shudder-a simultaneous, ,
unanimous and enthusiastic shudder. r
A shudder of this particular sort y
can only be cured with bonds; non
taxable, banking privilege, interest e
bearing bonds.
The moment these bonds are issued a
the shudder quits. In fact we never a
knew of a shudder which was more
amenable to treatment than the Wall ,
street shudder about our gold re- r
serve.
It's like thunder and lightning in a
play at the theatre-it'll stop when
ever it is properly requested so to do.
Bonds having been issued and the
Wall street shudder having been o
cured, what next? t
Another raid on the gold reserve,
and another well regulated shudder t
in financial circles-duly chronicled
by the hireling editors of the old r
party papers.
This shudder, like the other, can j
only be cured by issuing more bonds t
to get the gold back once more from
the raiders.
The government having got the b
gold back from the raiders, the raid
ers gather up another lot of silver
purchase notes and get the gold back
from the government again. t
Every time this game is worked it s
means a bigger debt for you and your a
children. It moans higher taxes, and t
darker homes. These bonds are your t
debts, and the taxes you pay are the g
ppoflts the raiders have made by hid- ,
ing away their wealth where it pays
no tax, draws interest from your c
taxes, and forms a basis for banking t
by which another profit at your ex
pense is reaped. r
When will this monkeying with the a
gold-reserve stop?
When will the government and the e
raiders quit playing into eacb other's t
hands? d
Not until the bonds have been run
up to a sum so enormous that your I
taxas can no longer meet the intereL.
To this limit they are going to go.
Beyound it they do not care to go. I
They are not such fools ias to kill the a
goose.
The syndicate whieh would not ap

copiously Idliote goose as the Amer. C

What will be the rext move. after t

they want?'
The retirement of the greenback:
The paper money of the go\ern
ment is to be destroyed, and the mo
nopoly of issuing currency and of
controlling its volumes is to be hand
ed over to the national bankers. Sil- 1
ver will be token money only; gold
will be the money of reserves and
final payment; bank notes will be the t
currency of the business world, and
the national bank monopoly will set
their own price upon that.
Take a broad view of the tendency
of events, and see if this isn't the sit
uation which threatens us:
First-The nation's public revenues'
mortgaged to Wall street syndicates
by means of bonds.
Second--The nation's private rev
enues put at the mercy of the WallI
street syndicates by means of the
transportation taxes levied by the
railroads; and the taxes levied on the
medium of exchange by the national I
bank monopoly.
Now bear in mind that the Wall
street syndicate which own your
bonds also own your railroads and
your national banks, and remember
that if these three agencies of extor
tion be powerful in the hands of sep
I arate owners, they are simpiy irre
sistible when united in the hands of
one gigantic combination!
Isn't your future rather perilous?
