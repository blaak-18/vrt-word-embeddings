islands was a manifold one of a mhill

Caracas. Venezuela. Dec. 20.-This
city, to which the eyes of the civilized
world have been so long directed. Is
one of the prettiest towns onl the west
ern hemisphere. At present, however,
it is more interesting on account of its
being a storm center of political and
diplomnatie activity than on account of
its beauty. Daily and nightly it is
the scene of patriotic demionstrations,
the populace joining in fervid out
breaks against what are ilrmed the
high hand(ed proceedings of Germany
and ;rent Britain.
Should worst come to worst and the
allies, as is feared in some quarters.,
attempt an invasion of the capital in
orlder to calpturte Castro and hold him
as a hostage for paymentof their claims.
it is safe to say they will have some

ted alike but even with this distinctih
the architecture remains monotonous.
The unpleasant impression ths madin

effaced by the beauty and strength of
the location and merica nt of the
city, and when one enters a typisca

is located a splendid statue of the great
patriot Bolivar. Next to him the Ven
ezuelans have the greatest reverence
for George Washington, alld in the sec
ond principal square in Caracas have
erected in his honor a statue of almost
equal magnificence to that of Bolivar.
The pride of the city. however, is
the beautiful tomb of Bolivar. This
tomb was originally in Trinity church,
but in 1870 was changed into a nation
al pantheon. In addition to the re
mains of Bolivar the pantheon contains
those of all the presidents of the repub
lic from 1870 and a few of the leading
men.
American enterprise has 4uade itself
felt throughout the city and is largely
responsible for the progress Caracas
has made in recent years. There are
two American telephone companies,
and an American corporation operates
the Bolivar Tramway company.
While Caracas is not the hotbed of
disease which so many Americans
popularly suppose it to be. it is far
from being a healthy city. Bad sew
erage renders it susceptible to fevers of
all sorts. Yellow fever is always spo
radic, but does not prtduce the panic
that it does In the United States, for
with careful nursing a Venezuelan has
a better chance of recovery than wouldi
an American stricken with typhoid:
fever. Another thing that tends to
make Caracas unhealthy are the aud

THUNDER -
MOUNTAIN GOLD
DISTRICT
[Special Correspondence.]
poise, Ida.. Dec. 30.--To the deter
mined and always hopeful prospector,
ever accompanied by the meek and low
ly burro, must be given the credit for
the discovery of the Tonmbstone, Tona
paugh,F!rass Valley, Ilomestake, Tread
well, Leadville. Ophir. Mercur and Crip
ple Creek gold mines. 'Twas the men
behind the burro that discovered Thun
der mountain. Three men. Ben. Dan
and Ed Caswell, with their little pack
train of burros, first entered and discov
ered what is now being claimed by
many western men as the greatest gold
district of them all.
Thunder mountain! There is some
thing tremendous in the words-a dis
trict mineralized for over 40 miles in
length by 20 miles in width, with its
g;'eat ore dikes showing almost as plain
ly as the rive-r bedls below them; a
worthl'>s w\iidilrnEss four years ago.
and now,. it is clnimeltl, millions of dol
i' s o;f '.i- yelliw are in sight.

cently that the real truth has drifted
east of the mountains. The first nota
ble fact was the sale of the Caswell
brothers' great find to Colonel Dewey
for the sum of $100,000 and his refusal
but a few months thei~eafter of $4,000,
000 for the property, the Dewey mine.
But where is Thunder mountain? In
Idaho, 200 miles north and a trifle easi
of the city of Boise. How to get there?
From Boise you take a pack train load
ed with your outfit and start on a 200
mile tramp through beautiful valls,
up over the roughest of mountains,
down steepest declivities, over deepest
canyons and trailing by purest crystal.
streams till you reach Roosevelt.
Roosevelt in July last was a city of
tents, shacks and log cabins, with not
a wagon track in sight. The streets
were alive with big, brainy and braw.y
men, there to reap their fortune, what
ever it might be. There was one lone
Texas girl; the only woman in the
camp. She, with her father, tramped
the hills day after day hunting for the
"yellow." She succeeded. .By a sale
of a fourth of her holdings to Pittsburg
people she derived a goodly fortune.
Every one but a few drones followed
the same occupation. That was all they
w-ere there for, and in.no such space of
time were as many hills irospected as
were those in the Thunder mountain
country during July, August and Sep
tember last.
First the discoveries. we'r made on
Trap creek, then on Smith creek, next
on Sugar creek, and only tomorrow per
haps the richer reports may come fran
other streams. The rush in the middle
of the night to locate claims was un
precedented. Occasionally some pros
pector sneaks into the assay office with
his little bag of "rock," and after the
result of the assay has been announced
he gives the tip to a few of ?is inti
mates. In an incredible space of time
that night the "trail" is covered by
scores who somehow learn of the new
prospect. The efforts of 2,500 prospect
ors to cover 500 square miles produced
restlts.
A group of Pittsburgers had their
forces at work on Rainbow mountain,
Fairview hill and Lightning peak. To
the Pittsburgers' energy and persever
aInce this section owes its early devel
opment and establishment as a perma
nent mining came. They own the
Fairview. Sunnyside. Lava creek and
Dewey group of mines, and the sea
son's development in all those proper
ties has revealed veins or dikes of ore
running from $6 to $1.200 per ton in
free gold ore.
And yet the great district has hardly
been touched. Thirty tunnels are being
run this winter, and by March or April
the strikes made will astonish the min
ing world. Nature has been lavish in
her distribution of gold on Thunder
mountain. The great dikes are 30 to
100 feet in width, and the gold is thor
oughly disseminated throughout the
vein or dike fillings. The vein Oilling
is a porphyry rock--soft, easily worked,
yet solid enough to stand well in the
excavations. There are already eight
tunnels driven to a depth of over 100
feet, and there is enough ore in sight
to justify the erection of a "reduction
plant.
The facilities for, 1eduit t the ores
of the district and the Â° extraction ol
the values are unusually good. Timber
abounds everywhere. There is not a
mile square that will not afford water
for 100 to 1,000 horsepower. Elec
trical power can be obtained at a min
imum cost. The expense of producin
a dollar's worth of goh? Is the yard
stick with which to i, 'sure a mine.
Should it cost a dollar and a rent the
mine is a failure. There is .,i district

"fake." Yet experts sometimes guess
right. They are now guessing right in
the Th~under mountain country ever
since the famous strikes of last July.
No tribute has to be paid to the smelter
or the railroad in Thunder mountain.
The ore Is mined and reduced to bullion
on the ground and sold at the assay of
flce in Boise City.
Thunder mountain has in embryo a
dosen homestakes today, and it has
only taken a few mopths of prospecting
to bring about the results. In the great
rush doubtless many valuable acres
have been passed over. It all could not
even be scratched. Great strikes will
be made during the coming summer on
ground overlooked, for that has been
the ease oftentimes in nearly every min
ing camp discovered. The rush of peo
ple to the Idaho mining country next
spring is bound to be phenomenal. All
over the west preparations are already
being made, and before springtime the
fever will be in the blood of the eastern
speculator and investor.
But a word to all. Do not start before
the 20th of May. The altitude of the
district is only 6,000 feet. but three to
five summits must be crossed, and till
May 20 the snow banks are high and
deep. The pack animal cannot pass
them, and without the pack animal
