NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

Washington. D. C. September 2 '9(.
Political Club organization has
proven one or the most effective ad
'. juncts to campaign work that has
s- ever been devised. The present
camnllaign has brought into exis
i- tence more clubs than any otner
"" known in the history of the coun
, try, Thie I'eople's P'arty must not

- shiould be a i'eoplle's Party Club in
evenlry towniship iii Anreiea andll,
where the l;party is strolng, in e(\r'
- school district. There sliouldl be
i oe ill elch village. andl in each
city clubs souldhi be organized by
swa-dsl. These clubs cain be niot onl
"- ly an ilmportant help in thie pres
ti' cut campaign, but they can also be
a permaunent good to tlie party.
Here is the plan: Let each
il State ('Committee recomimenil
In through the public ]press andil
a through the regular or'ganlization)
the starting of Populist
Clubs in every precilnct in the
ý State. No organizers atre ileccssa

camipaign iiandl after that as often
as they see fit. They are to report
the names of their officers (Chair.
man; Secretary and Treasurer) at
once to the National Commlittec.
together with a nominal charter ftr
of, say, one dollar. The National
SConummittee will in turn forward a
charter and enill tihe club as a
member of the National Associa
tion of People's Party Clubs.
These clubs rce to have public dis
cussions, are to distribute litera

are to do quiet work, to make con

every way practicabl :to lend en
thusiasm, energy and affectiveness
to the campaign. No iuitiation fee
shall be charged, and no dues oth
I er than those voluntarily coutribut
d ed. No dues shall be paid either
t to State or National Committees
other than voluntary contributionts,
i except the charter fee, which is to
c be turned at once over into the Na

n will be sent out from National
Headquarters to every club organi

Ic responsible for its proper distribu

All present organizations, such
as legions, alliances, Silver clubs,
popullist cluns. Bryan clubs and
other organizations which endorse
the pinciples of the People's Par

efoflicers, together with charter
fee, direct to these Headquarters
and become at once enrolled in the
National Organization.
All Peoples Party papers should
advocate this plan of club organli
e ration. It has the sanction of the
I- National Executive Committee and
will be handled directly from Na
tional Headquarters. All reports
and correspendence concerning
0 this matter should be directed to

)Dear Sir and Friend:--I am no

as drop you a few lines just to let you
l- know what wardi I; of Sab:ne par
I ish is doing.
nt We have organized a free silver

iv every ward in this State will or
be ganize and show IMr. Sewall that
he don't take much in Loiuisi:an;,
,. and that we will not support limu
s- under any circ;umstances.
be I hear plenty of men say that if

a- Mr. M. C. Ilamblin, of Star
1i1 light, an oil G(rant parish friend,
le added hif name to our subscription
s. list this week.
to
lie The Maine Election.
rt Every one expected Maine to go
r- Repullican. In fact, it is to be cx
it pected that all New England will
e. go stronger Republican this year
al than ever b:-fore, in as much as the
al gold men and monopoxlists in that
a section are all uniting on the Re
a publican party,
This is what made it .so unwise
for the l)emocratic party to go to
New Enzland for a Vice-Presiden
- tial canlidate, even if that ca:ndi
date had stood on the p!atform,
and represents what DMr. Bryan
- represents. But it is extremely
Lb uifortn.t' for the Chieago con
in vention to have gone not onily ,o
i. that section for the candid.&cd, but
ss in addition to that have selected a
ee candidate more in harmony with
h- the privileged plutocratic senti
it- ment of New Engladd than with
er the sontiment and interests of the
es great masses of the people in three
s, fourths of the states in the Union.
to Therefore, it was to be expected
a- that Maine would go even strong
re er Republican this year than ever.
al In short, Mr. Sewall seems to have
i- been a great load to the ticket in
ig Maine, his own State. The inoon
n- sistency in piutting such a man,
with such business associations and
h with business interests so directly
antagonistic to the platform, dis
Susted and demorclizlA even the
silver men in Maine. Mr. Sewall's
r own town of Bath went Republi
can by an increased majority.
M Mr. Sewall's personal unpopulari
ie ty among all thos2 who know him
and come in cont:act with him, had,
Id no doubt, a great deal to do with
. the zeault in his own town and
1e ward. If Mr. Bryan is unfort
id unately defeated, Sewall will be
a. the millstone about his neck.
t8 WATSON CAPTURES THE WEST.
'g Hon. Thos, E. Watson, People's
to party candidate for Vice Presi
I. dent, is making.a very strong im
pression in the West, where he has
been canvassing for the last two
weeks. ie is quoted as putting
the defeat of McKinley above ev
ir ery other consideration in this
Sfght,which is truly the highest
and most patriotic position that he
ic could possibly take. He and Bry
K an are two of the finest stump
a speakers in America, and represent
the people's side in this fight as
well as any other two men in Amer
ica could.
A telegram receivedl at People's
- party headvuarters from' lon. J.
a- H. Edmisten, chairman of the Peo
d ple's party State committee of Ne
brsks. says:
"Hon. Tom Watson, of Georg;la,
Smade the strongest speech at Lin
in coln to-daythat has cver been
at made on Nebraska soil."
S Your correspondent understands
that a complete union of the silver
forces has already been made min
about two-thirds of the states, and
that the outlook is 'good for accom
* plishing the same results in nearly
, allthe other atates. These combi
r. nations aremade notonly in the
South and West, but also in the
North and in New Englandl,

we passed the following reso lu
tions,
TIe Populi..ts in imass-nmettinl
assem len.i at Providence church. H
Sept, IstO, 1P-9%.
f Resolved, that we believe fusion
with the free silver democratic
Sparty on an electorial ticket will -
be of great benefit to Bryan and .1
Watson in regard to carrying the
State of Louisiana.
That we have the utmost confi
dence in the chairman of our State
committee. II. L. Brian and the
zentlemen he appointed as an aux
i!ary committee to settle this mat
ter of fusion, to do everything in
their power to adjust this matter
in an honorable way, for the bene- 2
fit of our party, and our ticket,
Bryan andt Watson.
That we promise our unswerv
ing support to whatever electoral
ticket male ,y our State and aux
iliry committee to meet at Baton
Rouge, Sept. 21t.
D. G. FnREE: MAN.
Scwall's Candidad y.
The press dispatches from the
West indicate that the rank and
file of the Populist party will not
be bound by the trades a:l(le by
the leuders in those states where
the d ,~n.dcrats were willing to give
tha state and county ofees for
Populist support of Sewall. As T
between §ewall and Hobart the
Populists have no choice, and they
will not support the one any soon- ht,
er than they would support the
other.
In Kansas a middle of t':e road T
electoral ticket will be put out, r*
pledged to Bryan and Watson. In
Kentucky and Indiana the same
thing will be done, also in the
West *Virginia. None of these p'
states can be carried by the Demo
crats alone, and keeping thoSewall o0
electors in the field simply amounts
to giving their electoral votes to
McKinley.
No Watson, no Bryan is then
Populist slogan, Not because a
they regard men more than. mess- lil
ures, hut because they hold meas
ures above men. and the course of
tbh democrats has plainly shown
that Sewall was nominated and is in
kept on the ticket as a pledge to at
the North and East that their sec
tional domination shall not be in- o
terrupted. al
The Chronicle says that the ex
pectation of the Populists that Se
wall will be withdrawn is doomed to
to disappointment. The Popu- th
lists do not expect it. They un- ti
derstand very well that he was put ar
on the ticket to keep the Populists ly
from giving their support to the te
Democratic ticket, just as Bryan lii
was nominatedl to prevent the sil- in
ver Democrats and Republicans
from going over to the I opulists. th
To nominate a Populist Demo-he
crat and a Goldbnug I)emocrat on fo
one ticket was a cunning plari to
prevent a union of anti-goldbtug p
forces. It is working to perfec
tion just as it was designed. Se
wall was put on the ticket to make e
sure the election of McKinley, and i
he will not be withdrawn.
The present issue is a sectional b
one. It is the North and East
against the South and West- The
re ent elections in Vermont and o
Maine have shown how solidly Re
publican that section is. McKin
ley and the Shylock conspiracy can
be defeated only .by the Union of
the South and West, which have ve
hitherto been always divided. The Bi
nomination of Bryan and Watson a
upon the same ticket offered a bond
of union. That ticket idopted by J*
the Democrats and Populists, as
representing both parties, woitld
nave united the Sauth and West, at
and resured their election upon a 1
tidal wave of enthusiasm: With
Arthur Sewall in the way as the
block cunningly interposed by the
Wall streeters, the opposition will
be split, enthusiasm is damponed,
the close states will be lost, and
McKinley and Hobart will be
elected by a large majority of the
electoral tote, just as Lincohl was
in 1800.
It is said that tfools will only
learn in the dear school of expen-r
ence, but nobody has yet ventured al
to msay what sort of a school the
Democrats would learn in.-Au

The Droutl Sufferrs Of Uraant
Parish,
Colfax Chronicle: Toe sufferers
by drouth in Grant parish will
numder about 1O) families in all,
say 500 men, women and children.
This is less than 10 per cent of our
resident population, but the indi
cations are that the drouth has
borne so severely upon the entire
parish that the resident citizens
will be able to afford but little help
to their stricken ncighbors. It is
only a question of a short time now
before aid will have to be extended
to some of the people. Let our
police jury take steps to ascertain
who are really needy and deserving
and let sonie systematic, business
like meteod be instituted to pro
cure help before actual distress be
gins to be felt by suffering women
and children. The rot that is be
ing printed in some of the papers
about state aid disorganizing labor
will not apply in Grant parish.
Our sufferers by drouth are nearly
all white people. The negroes live
in the bottoms almost altogether,
where tolerably fair corn and cot
ton crops have been made. In
the hills is a very ditferent condi
tion of things, There the people
are nearly all white farmers of on
ly moderate lmeans, aInd not one in
ten of them has made anything
like a crop. But they are a sturdy.
independent set out that way, and
even if aid is extended the bulk of
them would scorn to receive any
help. However, some will be
forced by neceesity to accept it.
