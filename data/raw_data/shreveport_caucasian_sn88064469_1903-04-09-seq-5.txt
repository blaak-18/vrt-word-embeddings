An Up to Date Chieago Church.
Religion and, art have joined hands
in St. -P'ul's Evangelical church at
Beverly Hills. W. M. It. French, di
rector of the Art institute, who is one
of the pillars of the new house of wor
slihip, has demonstrated that rstheti

'4£he church will house members of
twelve deanominatlons.
When one enters, a vista of beauty
greets him. Instead of the psual som

How One Iatnsa Wrote.
"A-Creek Indian gave me the neatest
solar plexus one day," says Deputy
Story in the Wagoner Record during a I
brief period of respite from Uncle t
Sam's duties. "About fifty witnesses c
were packed in behind the iall in my i

pulled the book toward himw-pude'

on, not to sign it upside down, and tried
to turn the book around. We are not
gllowed to have erasures on the reeord, !I
and the govnerent is mighty partee- j f

book and held It and said. 'Its all

If a man had sued the broker on ac
count of losses in the market. notiiin;
would have been thought of it. lBui
nass would have gone on as usual. But
one woman proved herself a fool; there
fore in the mind of this perslpie:iou-l
masculine reasoner all women ari e fools.
Women who have small or large
Sums ,of money to invest may learn
from the above case the important les
son that when they meet with loss-s
they must bear them "like a man" and
not whine or go into hysterics. To
meet adverse fate of all kinds wits
courage and calmness is the first step
toward success of any kind.
Having decided that she will bear
losses without squealing, the next con
sideration in the successful inv\'estmient
of money by a woman is to bewa're
with perfect horror of get rich quick
schemes. IIn at least ninety-mile (cases

.:nd the! conec(;etors of tihe plot were ar

to hold the cheated women ii order,
and then it was not done f ny too well.
The unfortunate victims tried to do
bodily violence to the rascatls. "Just
let us get at them:' they shouted.
They crowded, they walked over each
other. they ,hook their fists and
screeched. t nd one cr two tumbled over
in as pretty a make believe feminine
faint as you ever saw. Whatever you
do. never do that. I)on't be a fool. "
Here is another don't-never lend any
money for sentimental reasons to
brother, uncle, friend or great-grand
falier. You will be almost dead sure
to rue :t. Not long ago a widow with
some money met a sweetheart of her
youth: He appeared to be engaged in
magnificent money getting schemes.
He seemed to be more than ever de
voted to her. He got $20,000 cold cash

ant -of her "to invest." He swindled
her as cleanly as even a woman's near
est friend or old sweetheart can do,:
and that is saying much. Now the
woman has actually to do without
proper food and lodging. Forget not
this: Itusiness is business. Never asso
Idate it with sentiment. If you do, it
Swill be to your sorrow.
Once more: Never nlatrust your cap
Ital to an agent who is going to take it
far away1 and "inpst" It in ways that
will bring you in a million dollars a
minute. New mining regions are full of
these so called agents who are spend
nag money like water and reveling in
dispatio~n on the money that has been
pat into their hands by small owners
to be invested. If those,who have givr
en them the money could see them
Sporting on it, the deluded investors
womld be esred for good and all.
Where then shall women trust their
money?- T -begin, let them learn to
save maney. She who can spare only
$i may put it into a savings bank and
get hS to.4 per'cent oil it. A reliable
savings banrk is certailyone of the
best placees fr the deposit of small
anms. As these get larger there are
state, city and county bonds, which are
in nearly Ail cases to be depended on.
The absolutely best thing, however.
Ifor a woman to do is to learn business
and investmeut methods for herself.

somntimes to give plausible
ieasons for endeavoring to
hold all the money and the
power in their own hands. If they
- would come out square and say. "We've
got the power, and we mean to keep
it," one could have some respect for
their honesty at least. But when a
city board of education gives among
its reasons for steadily discriminating
I against women in the distribution of
t the higher and better paid place's for
teachers that women are unwilling to
serve under women principals and su
'perintendents this may be considered
a little too much. Plainly, as a gen
eral statement, it is not true. If there
over was a time when women had this
haremlike jealousy of one' another,
that time is happily gone by. Women
now know that the advancement and
happiness of each depend upon all of
them standing together as one. "I
looked and saw that all the women
held one another by the hand." says
Olive Schreiner in one of her marvel
Sous mystical "Dreams." With here
and there a lone, blighted exception,
women are standing tog(ether. They
know that womanly sympathy, help
and friendship are priceless to women

Beautiful garments were meant orig
inally to adorn the body, but in all
cases to be secondary to the body's own
beattty. Many women apcpear to have
lost sight of the originnl Intention and
to regard clothes themselves as the end
Instead, of m 'rely tile means. So long
as they have the clothes, everlastingly
the clothes. they apparently consider
that any so"'t of an old body will do to
hang these on. It is the worst mistake
that even a woman can make.
"I wonder." said the absentminded
professor. "what is the reason womnen
don't marry nowadays?" "They don't
have to," promptly responded the girl
bachelor.
The more splendid. and beautiful
clothing there is piled upon an ugly,
ungraceful body the more hideous it
looks by contrast. If women cared less
for elaborate clothes and more for
beautiful bodies to hang them on, the
human race would rgpidiy grow to
ward perfection. Every woman not
positively deformed can make her body
beautiful and graceful by industriously
and perseveringly usihg means within
the reach of all. Natural and hygienic
phykic31 culture is the means. Ameri
can women are born queens, and they
ought to look it.
Do something. Be of the noble army
of those who do things.

A young wife lately tried to commit

Never mind, young woman. Just'stay

Easter miorning and you'll s(, t.h,:
smart people dressed exactly as they
are every other Sunday. Time was
when there was a wild scramble to got
into new clothes on Easter day. No
matter how inappropriate the clothes
or how inclement the weather, the two
had to go together willy nilly. Airy
creations of tulle enveloped necks that
yearned for furs, and openwork straw
tilted itself coq uettishly over noses
blue with the raw wind. To wear one's
whinter clothes, one's felt hat above all,
was a disgrace almost beyond exl,res
sion. Mothers slaved that their daugh
fers might have an Easter outfit; girls
worked, stitched/away patiently into
the wee small hours of holy week and
even denied themselves necessary
things that they might dazzle their
neighbors and rivals on Eastei day.
From Grand street to Fifth avenue the
craze was the same. Thank the Lord.
that is over! If it's warm on Easter
day, you see straw hats and silk gowns.
If it's warm before Easter, you see the
i same hats and gowns. On the other
hand, if it's cool on Easter day, for a
fortnight after Easter you will see
heavy garments. We are no longer
swayed by a certain day."
"But you can't put the florists out of
style!"
"No: they have remained over from
the old Easter. People don't send the
ridiculous and useless Easter gifts they
used to. Instead they give a pot of
blossoming plants or a little bunch of
cut spring flowers just to herald the
coming of the spring. These floral
gifts are more elaborate this year than
ever, by the way, and it's quite a fad
to send with the flowers an odd vase,
Into which the stems are slipped. For
instance, a bunch of violets should be
placed in a little copper bowl of the
sort displayed in the florist's winnows,
orchids should rest in a dainty holder
of opalescent glass, etc. Even the sim
plest pot of spirnea which goes out Is
wrapped in pink and white tissue pa
per, plaited after the fashion of a dan
cer's skirts and tied with a big bow of
ribbon. And, speaking of spiraeas, I
want to say that one kind hearted rich
woman sent a thousand pots of these
pretty white blossoms to the sick peo
pie In the hospitals last year, which
shows that we still do have an Easter
feeling, but it's a sensible one instead
of a silly, extravagant one"
"And the children's Easter?"
"Oh, that's always with us- the
wonderful sugar eggs, with a peephole
through which one can catch glimpses
of fairyland; the rabbits, the wee
chicks, and, above all, the wonderful
eggs so popular for children's parties!
These are covered with artificial flow
ers and open by means of a spring, dis
closing as many smaller eggs as there
are little guests present, each small
egg being filled with candy. Take It
all in all, I think the children get the
best of Easter, just as they do. for that
matter, with every holiday throut:thout
the year." MAUI' ItO INSON.
