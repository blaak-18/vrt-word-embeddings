AM very much impressed with the
value of the sketches of the
great American triumvirate of
the 19th century, Calhoun, Clay
and Webster, as given in the
I
June number of Mr. Watson’s biog
raphy of Andrew Jackson. He was a
leader of so great passions and idio
syncrasies, of various kinds, that
without the prefix of an impartial es
tate by the biographer, he can not
be understood.
Undoubtedly it is very important
to American history that Calhoun
should be correctly represented in its
annals. He received more popular
votes for Vice-President, in 1824,
than John Quincy Adams got for
President in New England in that
memorable contest. He would have
succeeded Jackson in the Presidency
had he been less of a man than he
discovered himself to be.
The mightest demonstration of na
ture is the evolution of the prophet.
The evidence is abundant and over
whelming that Calhoun’s interpreta
tions of Jefferson, however little it
may be recognized in Taft or Bryan,
is the essential rallying point for the
Jeffersonian principles, in all this
time of storm periods.
Let us consider the decisive ques
tion of the Federal debt: Mr. Cal
houn had only been in Congress five
years when the matter of paying off
the public debt, incurred in the war
of 1812, with Great Britain arose.
To provide means to pay this debt, he
advocated the tariff of 1816. It was
a revenue tariff. He was a relentless
opponent of the public debt. What
part does the present enormous and
ever augmenting debt of the United
States play in the fearful concentra
tion of wealth in private hands and
in the resultant building up a mighty
no-property class? Undoubtedly the
public debt is the very foundation of
private monopoly of industries, which
we call trusts. Pay the debt, as Cal
houn proposed, and place upon the
Government itself the duty of supply
ing all the paper money required by
e business of the people as he pro
posed, to the final extinction of all
classes of banks of issue, as he pro
posed, and no trusts would ever ap
pear. Calhoun’s theory, if put into
force, would move the peril iminent
now from class government. It is
not possible to propose a single fun
damental principle of the Jefferson
ian creed that Calhoun failed to ex
pound and apply to the conditions
precedent to life of the American
idea.
I recur to the first protective tariff,
the act of 1816, Calhoun was chair
man of the House committee on cur
rency. While at his desk, absorbed
in the work of that committee, a
member from Pennsylvania came to
him saying, the House appeared to
be in inextricable confusion on the
tariff bill, suggesting that he should
go upon the floor and address the
body. Thus the speech of April 6,
1816, was delivered without a mo
ment’s preparation. Webster declar
ed years afterwards that this was the
ablest protective tariff speech ever
heard in Congress. It acknowledged
the duty of Congress so to raise a
revenue by tariff as to favor the in
dustries which Congress had encour
aged and relied on to support its
army and the country during the late
war and which could not survive a
sudden withdrawal of protection in
that way. But every item of the bill
produced revenue. The Act of 1816
bore no relation to the McKinley tar
iff or the Dingley tariff or the Payne-
Aldrich tariff. These late tariffs are
intended to perpetuate the public
debt; the Act of 1816 was intended
to pay off the war debt. I will quote
a paragraph from Mr. Calhoun’s
speech as an amusing incident in the
light of subsequent events. It was
delivered about two years after the
Hartford convention, where New
England met to make an organiza
tion for seceeding from the Union.
The South Carolinian said: ‘Tn my
A Study of Calhoun John Witherspoon Dußose
opinion, the liberty and union of the
country are inseparably united. The
destruction of the latter would most
certainly involve the former, so its
maintenance, with equal certainty,
preserves it.” Fourteen years later
Calhoun was Vice-President, presid
ing over the historic debate between
Hayne and Webster. Then he heard
in the chair Webster close his reply
to Hayne with this paraphrase upon
his own tariff speech of 1816 —■
‘‘Those words of delusion and folly,
Liberty first and Union afterwards,
but rather Liberty and Union now
and forever, one and inseparable.”
The coincident of language becomes
of historic importance: the arrange
ment of the words, first by the lo
gician and next by the rhetorician,
is suggestive of the mental processes
of the two men. Calhoun never let
fall a superfluous word. He went
straight to his meaning by the plain
est avenue of approach. Hence, he
seldom spoke more than 4 5 minutes.
His only jesture was with right hand
wide open held near and in front of
his body, cutting the air with a quick
nervous stroke, often repeated. An
Attorney-General of Virginia, one of
the four distinguished brothers, Bo
cock, told me, many years after Cal
houn’s death, that he often heard
the Carolinian in the Senate. He de
clared the mental strain in following
the speech was painful; before the
auditor could take in and revolve in
his mind a proposition laid down, an
other was heaped on it, and thus the
rapid flow of thought proceeded to
the end.
Within two years after the delivery
of this speech, as Secretary of the
War Department, he reorganized the
army upon military principles so ad
vanced that no change was made
under the test of the Mexican war
or the constant contact of the troops
with Indians until 1862.
While Secretary of War, Mr. Cal
houn established the system of gov
ernment observation of the weather.
No such function of government had
ever been exercised before. All the
enlightened nations of Europe heard
of it and adopted it. Conmmander
Mannery enlarged the scheme, ac
cording to his increased opportuni
ties, but these two men of the South
may justly claim the imperishable
honor of the introduction to all the
nations of government weather re
ports.
There are two instincts of the ge
nus homo peculiar to that genius.
They are the same, except in degree,
whether in the jungles of the Congo
or amidst the forests of the fair
skinned Germans. They are the in
stincts of religion and the instinct
of organization in forms of govern
ment. The mightiest demonstration
of nature, I repeat, is the prophet.
There have been prophets of God be
cause of the need. There have been
prophets of civics because of the
need. Nature reopens and acts.
Zoroaster, Buddha, Confucius,
Plato, Mahomet, the author of Magna
Charta, the author of the Declaration
of Independence, Napoleon, Calhoun,
stand as outward and visible signs
of the human instincts of religion
and organized government. They
are demonstrations of the processes
of nature. They appeared on earth
in their generations, respectively,
and in their locus, respectively, when
and where the economy of nature de
manded them. They survive in their
works today as indispensable fea
tures of God’s plan of the world
throughout all time.
Webster for want of argument to
meet Calhoun, pronounced the utter
ance of the Caralinian “metaphys
ics,” as in derision. Calhoun in re
ply delivered an apostrophe to the
science of metaphysics so lucid,
chaste and eloquent that it should be
read by educated people. Indeed, the
first text-book that Calhoun is known
to have read was Locke on “The Hu
man Understanding.” He was then
a mere lad, but so assidulously did
'dje Jeffersonian
he apply himself that the book had
to be put out of reach to save his
health. There is no doubt but that
his reasoning faculty was thus cul
tivated. When later his class at
Yale was called on to discuss orally
a proposition presented by the presi
dent, as Calhoun closed his deliver
ance the president exclaimed: “That
young man has talent enough to carry
him into the Presidency of the Uni
ted States.” Calhoun was ill when
the examination of students for
graduation was held and did not
graduate. A man who became an
old-field school teacher took first
honor.
Mr. Calhoun was Secretary of War
when Congress set aside several sec
tions of public lands in the western
part of Alabama to be sold at low
price to the exiled Bonapartists, who
bad then landed at Philadelphia.
They were several hundred, among
them Marshal Grouchy, General Da
vide, Col. Raoul and others.
The lands were of exceptional fer
tility. In his official capacity, Mr.
Calhoun became aware of this fact
and remembered it. So when this el
dest son, Andrew Pickens, married
a daughter of General Duff Green
and expressed a desire to become a
cotton planter, about the year 1835,
the father recommended the Ala
bama lands to him. An investment
in several thousand acres was made.
Andrew Calhoun brought his young
wife from Washington City to live
on it. He built a double log cabin
for her, furnished it handsomely, and
lived there like a prince. Many
slaves from the “Fort Hill” farm
were brought to the Alabama cotton
plantation.
I have already wearied you, but I
will venture a little more. Mr. Cal
houn came to the Marengo County,
Alabama, plantation twice; once in
1 844 and next in 1846, when on his
way, via the Western rivers, to pre
side over the Memphis convention, to
agitate the question of government
improvement of rivers and aid to
railroads. In his speech at Memphis
be advocated aid to a railroad to con
nect Memphis with Charleston, S. C.
He said the road must pass by
a little place place in Georgia called
Marthasville, and that a city of great
importance would rise up there—now
Atlanta!
The rich pioneer young planters of
Marengo county received the states
man with open arms. For many
years his dinner talk was repeated.
The lands there are rolling, wooded
prairie, then covered with dense cane
growth. There were no creeks, no
springs, no wells. Cisterns must be
excavated from the underlying soft
limestone rocks. At dinner, a large
company present, Mr. Calhoun re
marked, “You gentlemen have the
best watered farming country in
America.” How so?” The reply
came, “Your supply may be equal to
the demand, and the location is en
tirely at your discretion; you may
have cisterns of any desired capacity,
at all convenient places.” It was a
plain case, the country was well
“watered,” but news had long before
gone abroad that the Bonapartists
had abandoned their allotments, in
part, because there was no water.
Mr. Calhoun’s foresight relating to
the rule of the majority sections of
the Union, if accomplished, was early
developed, and was so marvelously
accurate that I must trespass on your
time to give two examples. Closing
speech in opposition to the pending
“Force Bill” in the Senate. The bill
of March,, 1832, which gave Presi
dent Jackson arbitrary power to set
aside the civil government of South
Carolina, just as President Johnson,
in 1867, was forced by Congress to
set aside the governments of eleven
Southern States, the Senator from
South Carolina delivered the follow
ing warning to the country:
“Every Southern man true to the
interests of his section, and faithful
to the duties which Providence has
r
allotted to him, will be forever ex
cluded from the honors and emolu
ments of this government, which will
be reserved for those only who have
qualified themselves by political
prostitution for admission into the
Magdalen asylum.”
May a Southern man become Presi
dent, Vice-President or Chief Justice,
or Commanding General of the army?
May any candidate for President or
Vice-President stand for restoration
of the government exclusively to the
white population, by whom alone and
for whom alone it was erected? Cot
ton, exclusively from the South, is
the controlling export of the coun
try: how many American consuls to
cotton importing foreign countries
go from the South? None. Why
did President Cleveland follow in the
tracks of his Republican predeces
sors by appointing negroes to high
Federal offices? Because the inter
ests of the Northern section required
that much of him, a Northern man.
I venture to say very few men in
the States which composed the
“Southern Confederacy,” now living,
ever read of, or ever heard of,.the
"Address to the Southern People”
written by Calhoun and published in
February, 1849, from Washington.
It was signed by Senators Jefferson
Davis and Foote of Mississippi, Fitz
patrick of Alabama and by many
others, and by Representatives Lump
kin, Iverson and Wallace of Georgia,
and many others. It was an appeal
to the South to unite, to convince the
rapidly developing revolutionists of
the North that the peaceable institu
tions of slavery should not be driven
out by fanatics. The address recited
that England had emancipated the
negro slaves of her West Indies colo
nies, but had not only paid the own
ers a liberal compensation, but main
tained troops on the plantations, in
the cities, to prevent disorderly con
duct in the freedmen. Very differ
ent, the address prophesied, would be
the course of the government of the
United States in the hands of a North
ern majority, toward the Southern
planters in the event of sudden eman
cipation of their slaves. It prophe
sied:
“The blacks and profligate whites,
that might unite with them, would
become the principal recipients of
Federal offices and patronage and, in
consequence, would be raised above
the whites of the South in the politi
cal and social scale.” Does not Mr.
Bryan, a candidate for the Presi
dency, educate his children along with
negroes? Does not President Taft
declare that the 15th amendment can
never be repealed? What do Mr.
Bryan and Mr. Taft mean except the
equality of the negro in the political
scale?”

The prints of feet are worn away,
No more the mourners come;
The voice of wail is mute today
As his whose life is dumb.
The world is bright with other bloom;
Shall the sweet summer shed
Its living radiance o’er the tomb
That shrouds the doubly dead?
Unknown! Beneath our Father’s face
The star-lit hillocks lie;
Another rosebud! lest His grace
Forget us when we die.
