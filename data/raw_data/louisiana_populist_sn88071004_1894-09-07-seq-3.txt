owns a five months old Jersey heif
er that gives a pint of milk every
day, from which he makes butter.
A well known and reliable deputy
clerk of that parish vouches for
the truth of the assertion by say
ing that'4e has "seen the heifer,
the milk and the batter." We
give it up. Shreveport cannot sur
pass that bovine curiosity. It is
entirely too warm to ran down a
wonder superior to this freak of
the animal species.-Shreveport
Times.
As Texas is greater than Louis
iana we know she's got its dupli.
cate, but she's too big to hunt over
now while the thermometer is set
tied in the 90's.-Jimplecute.
Having more curiosity than our
contemporaries, we hunted down
the prodigy, and had the surpris
ing satisfaction of seeing Mr. Gre
neaux milk the heifer, which was
calved on the 5th of I'ebruary last.
We saw no batter, but she gave
rich milk, and is certainly a ine
specimen 6f tbe co* kind.

the imitations when they can help them

My experience with the use and sale of

satisfactory. I can strn,gly endorse it,
as a good medicine,

I have handled Dr. Tichenor's Antisep
