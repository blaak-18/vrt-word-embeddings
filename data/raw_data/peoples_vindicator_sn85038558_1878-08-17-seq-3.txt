We learn that wild rumors have ben
circulated throughout the parish that
yellow fever exists in this city. Such is
not the case, for the fact is we have but
few cases of any fever at all. What
sickness prevails is among children and
we will in future puiblish the causes of
the deaths so that our country friend can
be assured of the health of this city and
its freedom from epidemical diseases.
The Shreveport Standard owes us a
subscriber. We published its reporter's
interview with the "210-bushels-to-the

from said individual was this: "You will

PINE VALL.EY, Alug. t10, 1878,
Mr. Editor :
Dear Sir-In answer to the Sunday
Bh~iald (Shreveport), the Grappe's Bluff
debating society is very sick. The boss
speaker made an awful spludge on both
sies and whiskey knocked him down.
The chair gave its decision in favor of
whiskey. That is the last of Grappe's
bluff dlebating society for the present.
Yours truly,
Fr'TUR HOPE.
A woman put herself in the hands of a
Boston dentist to have her teeth reorgan
ized. He found them in a very had
plight and asked her why she had al
lowed them to become so decayed with
ut coming to him or some other dentist.
She replied that she had not had time.
"But, be insisted, "It would not have
taken long, and you could have come in
almost any time." She saw that he was
bent on an explanation, and she fired this
at him like a cannon ball: "Well, I
guess if you had had a baby every year
for the last ten years you would think it
was about enough to tend to." He ac
knowledged that he should.
We have received a poem by "Ophelia"
which p aces nus in a rather embarnraing
position. Opheliasays: Kiss no one but
me, darling, Kiss no one but me: And 1
vow as I live. I'll kiss no one but thee."
This proposition is fair enough, certainly.
But we have never seen "Ophelia." Her
lines are not accompauied by her photo
graph as a guarantee of good faith. She
may have red hair, a celestial nose, and
poor teeth. We might be hugely sold if
we were to swear off indulging in oscula
tory exercises with the fair sex in gen
eral, and kiss no one but Ophelia. Be
sides. we are married, and our wife would
probably not give her consent to such
arrangement. "Ophelia" had better ap
ply to some other shop.--[Norristown

Chairman, Col. Wm. M. Levy, H. V.
Teesser, W. B. Powell, C. Hamlin and
Wm. French was held on Sunday eve

Levy adopted the following resolution :
"That no person or persons coming

in communication with any teamboats
or water crafts from an infected district
be allowed to come or remain within the
limits of this parish; norshall any per
son coming from any point where any of

That the )lidstrateSand Constables of

Captain 8inanott of Bart Able, ad the
commanders and officers of all other
stealonloats or water crafts which may
come within their limits, with an official
notice of ordinance of the Police Jury
relative to Quarantine; and to enforce
the prohibition contained in said ordi
nauces relative to the lauding of steam
boats and other water crafts within the
limits of this parish.
Overtasking the Energies.
It is not advisable for any of us to
overtask our energies, corporeal or Iental
but in the eager pursuit of wealth or fame
or knowledge. how many transgress this
salutary rule. It must be a matter of
great importance to all who do so to
know how to regain the vigor so reckless
ly expended. The remedy is neither cost
ly or difficult to obtain. lostettor's
Stomach Bitters is procurable in every
city, town and settlement in America. and
it compensates for a drain of bodily or
mental energy more ettf'etually than any
invigorant ever prescribed or advertised.
Laboring men, athlete,, students, journal
ists, lawyers, 2lergycmen, physicians, all
bear testimony to its wonderously reno
vating powers. It increases the capabil
ities for undergoing fatigue, and counter
acts the injurious effects upon the system
of exposure, sedentary habits, unhealthy
or wearyinug avocations, or an insalubri
ous climate, and is a prime alterative, di
uretic and blood depuront.
Ob i tu a r y.
D)ied, on the 11th of Augunt, 1878, of
1)iptheria, ARTHUIR JOSEPH, aged
four years and three days. Son of P. F.
lonis and Mary lHartman.
The subject of this brief nlemoir was
truly a bright and promising little boy.
Indeed he only seemed lent his parents to
show of what the Kingdom of Heaven is
composed. When he bowed his beaute
onus head at his mother's knee, to recite
his infant ' Pater Noster," and raised his
eyes aloft to earniestly beg God to "bless
all"-he seemed the personification of an
Angel -heo is one now, and their heart is
like the void that iomies, "When a
strain of music di.es."
Dear sorrow-stricken friends, your
darling little Arthur has hut "gone he
fore" you.
'Tho' you never more behold him.
Never hear his winning voice again,"
Remember, while you weep that he is
gone-he awaits you in the "BOautiful
Beyond" where he will greet you-to be
reunited evermore. L.
DIED
In Nltchlitoehes, La., August 11th, 1878,
KATE LILY BOULLT, youngest daught
er of D)r. W. II. Boullt and Maria A.
uinthnanee, age 4 years, 8 months and
15 dal s.
Death has been busy in our midst of
late but among the number whom he
has garnered with his sickle keen was
n,,t one purer, brighter, or more affee
tionate than little Katie At home, as
well as among her playmates, she was a
favorite. A constant attendant and
member of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, her winning ways and gentle
manners mnade her beloved by teachers
and her fellow pupils. But now she has
gone from their midst and become one of
the immortal choir in the tmple of the
New Jerusalam, forevermore to sing an
thems of praise before the Great White
Throne of the blessed Redeemer.
Folded the tiny hands
Across the peaceful breast,
Closed the beautiful eyes,
In Eternity's rest.
Hushed now the merry voice,
Faded the smile so sweet,
Silent forever now
The patter of her tiny feet.
Missed the beauteous smile.
Vacant the I ttle chair;
Ah, how our bruised hearts
Yearn for her presence fair!
Laid in the silent tomb
To her eternal rest,
Away from earth's deep gloom.
She lives among the blest.
Diedc,
August 2d, on the plantation of Mr.
George G. Sompayrac, Mrs. JENNY
WILLIAMS, f. w. c., aged 100 years.
It is sometimes pleasant to turn
from the exagerated honors paid the
great and noble, to study "the short
but simple annals of the poor." Few
of that class merit more honorable
mention than this old colored woman.
Hler life was rounded to a full centu
ry, the longest portion ot which was
passed in the family among whose
descendants she died. Her faithful
services extended through three gene
rations.
In the dark days of "the raid," she
indignantly rejected all overtures of
otlicers and men, and clung faithfully
to the family with whom her fortunes
had been cast. In the many helpless
years which preeeeded her death,
nothing pleased her more than to
gather around her a bevy of dark
skinned listeners, and dilate upon the
prodigal hospitality of the olden time,
and her own triumphs in the culinary
art, though not prepared perhaps like
tihe celebrated Freochlman, to commit
snicide because a conleve salted his
soup, she was very justly proud of
her skill, and our little town may yet
unmber somne who remember her
ragouts, as well as her name.
Poor old Jenny! her life slipped
peacefully away, kindly cared for by
those who appreCiated hier past servi
ces. Thie little fingers of fair young
children filled her pipe with the fra
grant weed shie loved, and looked up
wonderingly into her dark face as site
told her dreamy visions of the better
land, a place, by the way where the
Fifteenth Amendment was not enfrc
ed for "the cullud people, and tirhe
white people had each their own
place." ShIe was one of those who
"faithful in a few thrir gs" lhas doubt
less entered into her rest.
