"I believe Hood's Sarsaparilla is one of the
most wonderful blood purifiers ever placed on
the market. In the fall of 1890 I took a severe
cold at harvest-time and it settled in my limbs
and in a short time developed intotnflammatory
rheumatism. After trying different remedies

The r wader of this paper will be pleased to
learn that there is at least one daraded
disease that science has been able to care in
all its stages, and that is Catarrh. Hall's
Catarrh Cure is the only positive cure
known to the medical fraternity. Catarrh
being a constitutional disease, requires a
constitutional treatment. Hall's Catarrh
Cure is taken internally, acting directly on
the blood and mucous surfaces of the
system, thereby destroying the foundation
of the disease and giving the patient
strength by building up the constitution
and assisting naturemn doingits work. The
proprietors have so much faith in its cura
tive powers, that they offer One Hundred
Dollars for any case that it fails to cure.

The utilization of old furniture in
furnishing the home has not received
the attention to which as a measure of
economy it is entitled. The possibil
ities of an old chest of drawers that
has outlasted its usefulneas as such,
have seemingly remained undiscovered
to many persons. While the new uses
to which it can be put are manifold,
space will only permit pointing out a
few of the most useful.
A very good hall seat may be fash

shown in figure 1 was made from one
of those swell front affairs, so familiar
in New England homes of the past,
but of course any similar shape or pat
tern would be equally fitting. To
make the change it is necessary to re
move the upper drawers, upholstering
the space left thereby-seat, sides and
back. The fiat top of the bureau, of
course, will not be required as such,
and can be utilized as a seat by cutting
to the proper size and nailing in place.
The cushion may be removable and
can be covered with denim, jute, vel
our or corduroy to suit one's purse.
The back and sides should be padded,
covering with the same material as
cushion. Finish the edges neatly
with gimp of suitable color or small
brass headed nails. Should the wood
be dark mahogany any of the shades of
denim now offered will answer admir
ably. and the pillows and bolsters, if
used, may be decorated to advantage
with outline designs. The suggestion
of using so humble a material as denim
is with a view to economy; more costly
material may be used when desired.
A very handsome little settle may be
fitted up in the parlor in much the
same manner. Figure 2 illustrates
what may be done in this direction.

evenly, finishing off with one or two
coats of white enamel. The settle as
shown here has been decorated with
papier mache or composition orna
ments, wlich can be applied with glue
and nailed in place to suit one's fancy.
When hard, these ornaments may be
softened by wrapping in a cloth.wrung
out in hot water, afterwhich they may
be twisted to any design required.
House decorators and picture framers
are large users of such material, and
amateurs may purchase of them. When
such ornamentation is attempted it I
should always be previous to the
painting, and may after this latter
process is effected be further touched
up with gold paint. A beautiful
white and gold divan of small dimen
sions, particularly well adapted for
placing against the back of an upright
piano, can be gotten up in this manner
at small expense. Upholstering of
silken texture and cushions of India
silk will complete the ensemble.

How to Make Powder Stick.
If you must use powder and it won't
stick on, try this: (let an ounce or two
of cocoa butter-costs about ten cents
an ounce and looks like tallow. Rub
it on your face briskly until the skin
is well greased. Take a soft linen
cloth and rub the butter off-and you
will wonder where all the dirt came
from; then repeat the process, this time
rubbing the skin well after applying
the butter. Again rub the face with
the cloth and apply it vigorously.
After that rub on the powder and your
skin will feel like satin. You can use
it on the neck and arms the same way
and it is not likely to rub off and make
your skin look shiny. Cocoa butter is
a good skin food and is harmless.
The cewest Piacashlaon.
The newest and daintiestthing in
pincushions is the following: A
wicker basket, about the size and
shape of the bowl of a clay pipe, is
flled with finely cut curled hair. Then
a bit of blacke velvetis used as a cover
ing for the top, and black pins are
stuck over the top in graduated rows
till it is entirely covered. If the round
heads are used it will look like a great
blackberry. Now narrow lavender
ribbon is tied around the basket and
long ends with bows, by which to
hang it up._ _
For Wardrobe and Chlonles.
A delightful recipe for scent-powder,
to be used for wardrobe, boxes, etc,
far finer indeed than any mixture sold
in the shops, is the following: Cori
ander, orris root, rose leaves and aro
matic calamus, one ounce each; laven
der flowers, ten ounces; rhodium, one
fourth of a drachm; musk. five grains.
These, after being thoroughly mixed,
are reduced to a powder. Placed
among feminine finery, this sachet has
the same effect upon clothes that
ewould be produced by fragrant fow- i'
era, if pressed between the folds.

Dress Tem as.
It often needs only a few intervean
lug years to obhange our most oommon
place surroundings into the most ro
mantle; often in but a few years we
learn to oherishanything which recalls
to us old associations. I am certain
that to a friend of mine no work of fio
tion could ever suggest so much gen
uine comedy and tragedy as a unique
little album which she showed to me
I recently. The* book itself was a very
ordinary one, of the sort generally
used for receiving clippings, but the
pages, instead of containing bits of
fugitive verse, stamps or signatures,
were filled with an odd collection of
dry goods. In the upper left-hand
corner of each page was fastened a
fragment of dress material; opposite it
a clever pen and ink sketch of the
completed garment had been drawn,
and below was given a written biog
raphy of the same, containing all sorts
of interesting items in regard to it;
its price, its date of purchase and the
occasion of its first appearance. The
owner of the book was an artist and
had supplied the sketches herself, but
itoccurred to me such a book would
be interesting even without the
sketches, as the beauty of the pages,
to my mind, lay quite as much in their
suggestirveess as in their artistic ar
rangement.
Several other friends who have heard
of this book have been pleased with
the idea and have started similar
books. A young girl who is about to
be married has decorated her first
pages with bits from a very dainty
trousseau. She intends to put in her
book a piece of every dress she may
own.
A young mother has just commenced
such a collection for her baby daugh
ter. Should the child live to woman
hood the book ,will be to her a com
plete record, not only of her vanished
youth, but also of the mother-love that
guarded and glorified it.

HOW TO KEEP ICE.
A ek-eRoom Blnt WYhleh Certainly Is
Worth Knowing.
A very simple but little known meth
od of keeping ice is to draw a piece of
thick flannel tightly over some deep
vessel, like a bowl, for instance, and
fasten it there. The ice is placed on
top of this drumhead and covered
loosely by another piece of flannel.
In this condition the ice keeps cold
and even freezes to the flannel. Thus
a small piece of ice can be kept near
the patient all night, so as to avert
many weary marches up and down
stairs to the refrigerator.
To break the ice a sharp needle or
I hat pin is the best thing. Force it in
and you will be astonished to see how
easily it will divide the ice.-Vesper
L. George, in Youth's Companion.
A N'egro Superstitlon.
"*While I was in Florida I was a
great deal amused at an incident I wit
nessed which illustrated a supersti
tion that appeared to be prevalent
among the negroes," said a tourist.
"One day an old negro who ihad been
out rabbit-hunting care home, bring.
ing with him an immense rattlesnake,
which he had killed. He exhibited his
trophy with pride to a ecowd of tour
ists who were standing about in front
of the hotel. The reptile measured
six feet three inches and had twelve
rattles and a button. One of the
guests ofered the negro a dollar for
the rattles. The negro did not seem
to think that was enough for so valu
able a trophy, and said he would not
sell them for less than two dollaras
Just that moment another old negro
came upon the scene, and, upon hear
ing what was going on. said to the
owner'of the snake: 'Doan yo' cut off
dem rsattles.' 'Wharfo' won't I cut off
dem rattles, ef I kin get two dollars
for um?" demanded the other. 'Dean
you know dat ef yo' eat of dem rattles
yo' go blind? When yo' cut 'em off, de
milk ob de snake dy up in yo' eye and
blind yo'.' The owner of the rattle
snake pondered for a moment and then
he said: 'Ef any gen'lemamn give me
two dollars for dem rattles, he can
have 'em; I cut 'em off, 'nd if I go
blind, all right. I'se seen enurt any
how.'"--Stl. Louis Globe-Demorat.

Don't Blame the Cook
If a baking powder is not uniform in strength,
so that the same quantity will always do the same
work, no one can know how to use it, and uni
formly good, light food cannot be produced with it.
All baking powders except Royal, because
improperly compounded and made from inferior
materials, lose their strength quickly when the can
is opened for use. At subsequent bakings there
will be noticed a falling off in strength. The food
is heavy, and the flour, eggs and butter wasted.
It is always the case that the consumer suffers
in pocket, if not in health, by accepting any sub
stitute for the Royal Baking Powder. The Royal
is the embodiment of all the excellence that it is
possible to attain in an absolutely pure powder.
It is always strictly reliable. It is not only more
economical because of its greater strength, but
will retain its full leavening power, which no
other powder will, until used, and make more
wholesome food.
