RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION.
A few days ago that broad
minded journal, The Times-Demo
crat, commented upon a fresh case
of religious : periecution reported
from Monroe-county, Miss. With
a few more papers like the T-D. re
ligious fanaticism and ;puritanism
would soon be at a discount in this
country. It never misses an ap
portunity to speak words of con
demnation of the fanatic's work,
thereby calling the attention of
fair-minded people to the outrages
which are -committed in the
sacred names of religion ;tnl of law.
The following is the special which
casled forth the timely editorial
from The Times-Democrat:
,"Aberdeen, lss., May ag.
Mr. John Nash, a Seventh-Day Ad
ventist, was yesterday arraigned in
Justice Rye's court, at Amory, in
this (Monroe) county, on the
charge of working in his field on
Sunday. Nash pleaded guilty and
undertook the management of his
own case, using the Bible for his
law book. He keeps Saturday as
religiously as a priest keeps Sunday.
The case was continued until the
second Saturday in June.
"The Mississippi statute bearing
upon the subject, in section a2g9,
provides that -'Any one who shall
labor on the Sabbath day at any
other than household duties, works
of necessity or charity, of an rail
roads or steamboats, shall, on con
viction, be fined not more than $2o
for every such offense."
By working in his fie!d on Sunday
John Nash has invited the deadly
enmity of a few sanctimonious fools
who have a peculiar style of serving.
the Lord. It will hardly meet with
the approval of sensible people who
are Christians at heart as well as in
name. If the Seventh-Day Adven
tists choose to keep Saturday as the
Sabbath and do their farm work on
Sunday, inrWhat way do they inter
fere with the rights of the other
creeds? Things have reached a
pretty pass when a man can not hoe
his corn or plant peanuts on Sun
day without being dragged before
the courts as a common criminal by
a lot of religious cranks.
WVe do not know any of the peo
who are persecuting the Seventh
Day Adventists in Mississippi; but
we will venture to say that they
have not half as much religion as
the victims of their hell-born
hatred. The man who presecutes
his neighbor on account of religion
is mpse dangerous than the anar
chist. The latter is an open enemy
go society and is an outlaw, while
the former pretends to be a meek
follower of Christ when in reality
he is an emissary of the devil.
The Supremne Court's Decision
Agaiust the Income Tax.
Springfield Republican (Ind.)
The newspapers of the large cities, the
centers of wealth from which radiate
the great influences of wealth, with
very few exceptions, hail the
decision of the supreme court in the income
tax case as a triumph of liberty and justice
over an attempt to distribute some part of
the federal taxes according to wealth. They
also as a rule treat the decision ss a finality.
This is strangely overlooking the final source
of political power in tuse nation. The su
preme court, it needs hardly be said, is but
one of the branches of a government estab
Slished by the people. What the will of the
people is in regard to the income tax has not
yet been determined. We only know that in
both houses of Congress the tax proved to be
perhaps the strongest feature of the tariff
law. Republican conventions were signifi
cantly silent about this act of an opposition
majority in Congress.- If the tax was odious
only a very few people appeared to think so
strongly enough to say so. It it was social
istic the mass of the people represented in
these State conventions seemed to be
socialistically inclined. Laws in the end
will shape themselves agreeably to the senti
ment of the mojory of the people. They
make a great mistake who think to fina in
- the decision of the supreme court the final
word against the so-called socialistic tenden
cies or the moment. The people, whether
for gool or ill, will speak that word. The
constitation.of the ,United Statq as it has
been left by the income-tax decision of the
t supreme couwtt cannot sa ly be 1peraited to
stain." There a're two good adid sfficient

Intemperance and the Catholic
Church.
SRev. James M. Clcary.
g During the past twenty-one years
the Catholic Total Abstinence Un
ion of America has done n,;ble and
Sheroic work in the cause of sobriety
and public decency. But with our
.' ten millions- of Catholics, this grand
association should number instead
of sixty thousand, six hundred thou
Ssand members. If our church coun
e cics are to be heeded, if the utter
i ances of the sovereign pontiff are to
be respected, if we will not turn a
deaf ear to the repeated appeals of
our best and wisest prelates, there
must be a new awakeningamong oiii
Catholic people against the wither
1 ing curse of drink.
Our Catholic people expect too
much from the church if they enter
tain the delusive notion that the
Schurch can save weak men f im
Sruin while her own children, by
their voices or their ballots, do not
aid in diminishing or removing the
occasion of sin. There is not much
p consistency in applauding the de
crees and admonitions of our church
- councils in theory, and in practical
life withholding our suplport from
the influences that make for the re
alization of what the church incul
cates.
The church, by the united voice
Sof our bishops- assembled in the
5 third plenary council of Baltimore,
warns its members against the
dangers of the dritok habit and the
- temptations of the salooer. The
V same council warns our pCatholic
e people against the business of sa
loon keeping as "an unbecoming
· way of making a living." A man
Scannot be a good.Catholic, a loyal
followsr of the teachings of the
church of this country, and be a
n good friend of the saloon. Much
less can a Catholic be a saloon
· keeper and a dutiful child of the
church. We should at least have
h the couruge to follow wrere our
C chief pastors lead, and our Catho
, lic loyalty is not above supicion if
f we are not as ready to condemn the
y drink evils as our bishops, who
have been placed over us ",to rule
the church of God."
t The drink curse shields itself be
hind false theories of science, and
C many have been deluded by - the
' false notion that alcohol is bene
ficial to health. forty-four states
of this union have by law made the
i teaching of Irue principles of tem
perance compulsory in our common
o schools. Too- mpch importance
I- cannot be attached to the practice
" of inculcating -habits of total .ab
d stinence among children and our
boysanrid girls -during the danger
y out and trying period of youth..
-If our prelates, priests and people
join .hands together to work in har
in mony and- strenth for the realization
e of .She admonitions of-,our plenary
councils, the-kwful curse of intem
~.perance Ca. ibe - almost entirely
