impression throughout
the State. Those who understood
his election to mean that the reform
ers in Georgia had taken the back
track, now know better. Time and
again the Jeffersonian has combatted
that view, and Governor Brown’s
message to the Legislature warns the
corporations to make no mistake on
that point. He tells them plainly
that they, like other citizens, must
obey the law. For political effect,
laborious efforts were made in 1908
to convince the people that “Little
Joe’’ belonged to the railroads, —
body, boots, and the other things,
—but there never was the slightest
foundation for these outrageous in
sinuations. The message proves
what the Joe Brown supporters be
lieved all along,—that his purpose is
to make a good Governor for all the
people.
By a vote of 55 to 18, the Senate
defeated the proposed duty of ten
cents per pound on tea.
TiHmand and
the Tea Duty
favored this tax on the
ground that they “wanted to see pro
tection extended to the people of the
South.” The people of the South
who would have been benefited by
this increase of ten cents per pound
on tea was the South Carolina gen
tleman who has a grove of tea plants
somewhere in Tillman’s State. This
gentleman produces a few thousand
pounds of stuff that is politely called
tea. In order that he might pocket
a few hundred dollars per year ad
ditional on the output of his grove,
the effort was made to compel the
millions of tea drinkers in the Uni
ted States to pay ten cents more on
each pound that they bought from
those who import tea from abroad.
The absurdity of the claim that such
a tax would have extended the bene
fits of the protective system to the
Southern people is glaringly self
evident.
Senator Bailey supported the Till
man proposition upon the ground
that such a tax would be a revenue
producer, bringing in about nine
millions of dollars a year.
The way the tax would have
worked would have been this: all the
people who consume imported tea
would have been mulcted in the sum
of nine million dollars, and the
South Carolina gentleman who owns
a tea patch would have increased his
income by SI,OOO.

only reach that portion of the wealth
of the country which is to be found
in the corporated companies.
Senator Aldrich admitted that he
was using the corporation tax to
sidetrack and defeat the income tax,
and that the corporation tax was
meant to be effective for only two
years. With cynical candor, he de
clared that he opposed the income
tax because that would prove an ene

absurd to claim that
the leaders of that party meant that
the voters should understand that the
taxes were to be increased. But be
cause the platform was ambiguous,
Mr. Bryan very naturally made the
point on it that it did not promise a
revision downward. This was in the
heat of the campagn, when the Re
publican forces had not been given
that injection of White House ginger
which stirred things up and started
the tide swiftly Taftward.
Consequently, the Republican can
didate for President felt the force of
Bryan’s point, and knew that it had
to be met. Therefore, he lost no
time in putting himself on record in
the most public and positive manner
as construing the platform to mean a
downward revision. The country
took Mr. Taft at his word. Such Re
publicans as Aldrich, Lodge and Gal
linger, who have been framing the
tariff bill which violates the pledge
of Mr. Taft, must have read his
speeches, as all others did, but they
were very careful to keep their
mouths shut until the election was
over. It may not embarrass those
New England Senators to violate the
contract upon which Mr. Taft was
elected, but it will certainly embar
rass Mr. Taft when he seeks re-elec
tion; and it will prove a terrible
handicap to Republican Congressmen
when they go before their constituen
cies next Fall. The President is fully
cognizant of this, and he has taken
occasion in his address delivered last
week to the 1,800 graduates of Yale
to warn his party that unless they
keep faith with the people they may
expect repudiation and punishment.
