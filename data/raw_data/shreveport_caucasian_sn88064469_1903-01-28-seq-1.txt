JUDGE PORTER'S CHARGE.
A Protest Against Lynching-An Ap
peal for Law and Order..
The charge of Judge Porter to the
rand j cry of Natchitoches will leave
Its impress on every citizen favoring not
only lair and .rder but justice. Unfor
tunately there are beings who assume
that a nigger, like a wild beast, may be
shot and killed at will for any provoca
tion. Judge Porter condemns the mob.
He upholds the law. There can he no
excuse for lynching except the nameless
crime. The case to which Judge Porter
calls special attention is the lynching of
a negro near Robeline. This negro had
resisted arrest. "I am informed," says
Judge Porter. "that about the Ist of
this month a negro man was taken from
the lock-up in the town of Robeline and,
as am informed, after being beaten in
the most inhuman manner, was stran
gled to death by being hung to a tree.
The victim of the mob in this case was
not charged with that nameless crime
w . ch sometimes plunges whole com
munries into a frenzy of rage and
brogs swift justice upon the perpetra
tor. So von observe that the mob in this
case-not only assumed the right to exe
cute the law, but actually exercised the
highest power of the sovereign, the
power to make the law. The community
in which this helpless prisoner was
murdered-and it was murder, in the
sight of God and man-is noted for its
schools and churches, its Christian men
and women. and its cultured society;
and I am happy to say that the sub
stantial people in that community are
united in condemning the outrage."
It is not expected that the grand jury
will find a bill against any one connect
ed with this mobbing but Judge Porter's
charge will have a good effect. It will
at least stand as a protest against this
act of the lynchers-a condemnation of
an unwarranted, an illegal assumption
of authority on the part of citizens who
should uphond the law. Lynching can
not be excused, except for the nameless
crime, in a civilized community where
courts and juries can dispense even
handed justice and mete out punishment
commensurate to the crime committed.

THE LUCKY MAN.
3. The Sun Milling Company's Sack of
Flour.
ie The sack of flour donated to the Gen
'e evieve Orphanage and which was on ex
tt hibition in a show window of Ben Holz
man's dry goods store, was awarded by
e number to B. F. Oneal, United States
e marshal. The sack contained a $io gold
piece and realized $446.3o. Mr. O'Neal
>. has returned the sack of flour and the
n ten dollars to the ladies who have had
s the management of the fund realized
r and who no doubt will again offer the
f sack of flour and the gold piece to a
I generous public. Mr. Oneal's action is
s most commendable. To help the father
f less is a duty for which the reward
must he meted out in a glorious here
after.
CLOTHES AND THE MAN.
A Boy Taught a Valuable Truth
Which He Stil Remembers.
"You can't judge a man by the
f clothes he wears," said Edward H.
Hill. "Twenty years ago my father
had a jewelry stare hI Smithfield street,
and I was employed aa'boy of all work.
One evening a poorly dressed, rough
looking man came into the store, and
my father, thinking he was after alms,
told me to see -what he wanted. I
stepped up and was about to tell hind
we could do nothing for him, when in
a gruff voice he asked to look at a
gold watch," says a Pittsburg ex
change.
"I * was completely surprised and
thought I would cut his cutkiosity short
by showing him one of the most ex
pensive timepieces we had. He took
thelwatch, examined it in detail amti
asked if that was the best we had. On
being told it was valued at $1i50 he
said it would do. You can imagine my
surprise. I had never made a- big sale
before.
"'Now, sonny,' said the man, 'have
you $ot a chain to-correspond with the
watch? I showed him one of our heav
lest gold chains. He then wanted to
look at watch charms and selected a
good locket. He put the locket on the
chain; fastened the chajp to the watch,
put them all In his pd het and asked
mn what the damages were.
"'Two hundred and fifty dollars,' 1
replied, expecting to see bhin band
back the goods. Instead be loosened
his vest and, rieaching into 'a leather
belt around his 5ialst,- drew-out a num
ber, of large old nuggets, gold coins
and several valuable stones. He cotit
ed the amount of his bill and -started
to leave the store. Upon- reaching the
door he turned and in a grftf but ear
nest voice said:
" 'Say, my boy, Kinney is my name
". P. Kinney. I am a miner just re
turned to the east from diggin's in Cal
Itornla. I have been In Pittsburg all
day and tried to buy this outfit at sev
eral jewelry stores, but you .are the first
person who has treated mee like a man.'"
A gray haired man, bowed with age;
whose wrinkled face showed the ef
fects of exposure 'to sun and wind,
stepped from a Baltimore and Ohio i
train from the west the other morning
and walked slowly up "Smithfield
street. Stepping Into Mr. Hill's stane,
he laid a gold watch on the cowater. .
"Say, mister," le said In a feeble 4
voice, "my name Is Kinney,-M. P. ,Kim
net of Califrnia.. Here's a watch 1
bought here twenty years ago, andsbe- I
In' aroand these parts again, I thought 1
I'd just drop in and see if the piece
needs cleanin'. I have been all over the 4
country since -I bought that watch, and I
it's more'n likely got a little dust in it."
Mr. Hill took the watch and; shaking I
hands with the old man, told him of I
how, twenty years ago, in the garb at
a California miner, he Impressed upes I
him the truth of the old sayIg"Yau
can't Judge a man by thus clothes he
wears."

MAGIC MIRRORS.
f fow Instruments Used by Magicians
and Swindlers Are Made.
The aphorism of Barnum that the
public loves to be humbugged finds 1
lustration in the success of the oculirsg
in this country who sell "magic mL -
rors" to credulous individuals for $C
y and $10 which cost one-tenth those
s figures.
d Some of these charlatans with sub
lime assurance have called the law to
e their aid to protect them from rivals
or, it may be, to add prestige to their
merchandise, as several of the mirrors
are, or claim to be, covered by letters
e patent, copyright or trademarks.
3 The mirror makers can justify their
s calling with precedents numberless.
- The belief that a bit of bright metal or
I glass could be so charged by the black
art that it would reflect in visible form
the invisible things or beings about us
is as old as civilization. Egypt and
Babylon, Persia and India, Japan auid
China, have made and used these oc
cult Instruments from early times.
Those which are made in the far east
possess qualities which at one time
were puzzling, but which, when the
secret was discovered, were found in
genious utilizations of optical laws.
The simplest is the Japanese lucky _
mirror, a fair model of which the writ
er saw in a Broadway shop a couple
of days ago. This is. a flat plate and
handle made of a metal resembling
steel. One side Is-so highly burnished
that it reflects as well as the best sil
ver backed looking glass,. The reverse
is chased in low -relief with figures of
vines, bhirdi, clouds and ideographs or
talismans. When employed in the usu
al fashion, it does not differ from an
ordinary mitror, but when a large
beam of tght is thrown upon it and re
flected upon a dark wall or ceiling in
the reflected circle appears a luminous
face, Ideograph or other figure. The
result is secured in the original weld
ing or casting of the mirror, when a
piece if metal of d4lleredt composition
shaped like the figure ,it is to produce
Is fused Into the. clrcumijacent mspas.
A similar effect is produced in sil
vered mirrors by Just laying on the re
flecting character in one kind of tinfoil
and filling In the rest of the surface
with a fell of the same appearance, but t
different reflecting quality. Akin to
this style of work are the magle lac
quers which at certain oblique angles I
disclose figures-and lines which are in
visible when looked upon at right an
gles4o the laequer's surface. Oddest
at t ode tai-ntirrers are those set at
tho bottom of a cylinder or truncated
cone *bosewnurface toIwaved or undu
lating. The base reflects in ordinary
manner; the sides in such a fashion as
to produce fed or focal girces at vari
ous points. -Froi oe. pint of view
the looker sees a faint halo about his
face at the bottom of the cylinder;
from a second pptht -a misty human e
face alongside-at his own; from a third
a face looking at him through his re- p
flected eyes. a
The principle which anderlies these
odd images is the .dame as that used J
by COoke and Maskelyne in London in J
producisrtb " ialbo" and seems to
have been employed with great skill

tury.-New York Post. .
