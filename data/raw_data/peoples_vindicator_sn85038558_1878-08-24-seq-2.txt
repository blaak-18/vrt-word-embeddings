ANNOUNCEME N T S.
We are requested to announce W. S.
CAMPBELL ESQ., as aº candidate for
Sheriff of the parish of 'Natchitoches.
subjoct to the action of the Democratic
Convention.
For Sheriff.
We are authorized to announce L. A.
DEBLIEUX as a candidate 1 or Sherif,
subject to nomination by the Decmocratic
Convention of this parish.
Candid Talk.
Our colored people are certainly a
very incredulous people, not to say a
bad lot, if they should persist in sup
porting the same class-in fact the very
same men-which reduced this commu
nity to utter beggary in eight short
years.
We expect colored people to be igno
rant; that is a misfortue not only to
them, but to us. At the same time we
expect them to learn something by ex.
perience, and not stumble on in blind
passion, hatred and prejudice to our and
their material ruin.
Our most Conservative citizens have
strenuously exerted their influence in
order to give, the colored people an op
portunity to judge of our professions, of
our promises, by our acts, should we
ever achieve political power. That, we
have done, and we assert nothing but
the truth when we say that the only
two years of peace, contentment, justice I
and liberty enjoyed by the colored peo
ple since 1865, has been during Demo- t
cratic rule in 1867 and 1878.
The stories of the wrongs the white
men would inflict upon the negro, should
they secure the government of Louisiana,
have been fully exploded by the logic of
events. No slavery has been fastened
upon him or his by the white people,
and the public schools, from which he
was taught to believe his children would
be driven, have been more open, better
conducted than ever before; still, we are
sorry to learn that the great body of t
colored people are still joined to their
political idols, and are "waiting for or.
ders" from the same lot of bnummers who
plundered this parish for so long a time
No one desires the welfare of the col
ored people more than we, because we'
know them to be essential to the devel
opemett of wr agricultural wealth if
they can be taught to act concert with
us, but their is a point to our endurance
which can be speedily reached-and not
more speedily than by their supporting
this crowd of Natehitoches thieves for
office.
The white people have had enough of
that, and the colored people will commit
a sertious and to them disastrous crime
a blunder they may have cause to ever
regret-should they attempt it.
The beet citizens of this parish are de
termined to wipe out the whole gang of
Radical plunderers now In office here,
and nothing shall stand in the way of
such a virtuous el mation. TldA is as 1
true as gospel, and the colored people
had better come with us or stand aside.
No more Blunts or Boullts or Barrons or I
Bredas, will ever strut officially through
this parish. They must retire to pri
vats life, from which they emerged dn
ring an upheaval of society long singe
quieted. They were the creatures of an
age of debauchery and villainy, now
happily past never to retnrn, and their
efforts only serve to irritate and, retard
sooiety-possbly to- so outrage it as to
invoke summary justice to rid the com
munity of their evil presence.
Local Ollers.
Police Jurors form this and all other
parisebee are elected in faitnre form
their respective wards as in the good
old Democratic days. Wards 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, irr each er ti.

in their resident wards. Let the
DemoOitb torn out and elect good
men to those oilces.

The VIoNDJoA10 will annouance
Ward Candidates for $3, which siai
will inoelade the cost of prtnting their

Yellow Fever.
()1ur reports front thie Shrevceport lien.
and S(tadard, show increase of th lie fiver
in numerous towns and cities along the
Mississippi and in the interior. Min.
phis, Port Gibson, Vicksburg andt Grena
da, are anflicted terribly. In New (hr
hlans, the increase is slow and thlie total
lnlumber of cases to this dlate does not
showv, in comparisonl)iou with other years
when yellow fever prevailed, a very Iad
state of allairs. Our parish is now thor
oughly quarantined; we learn that
Rapides and Avoyelles propose to follow
our example. It they do, and all coil
munication with New Orleans and the
Mississippi river is cut oil, there will be
no danger from the scourge in our valley.
We learn that persons on the East
side of Red River went to St. Man ice
last week and hauled into this pari. h
the goods put off there by the Bart Ab:e
last week. Such conduct may smack of
personal bravery to those who don't
know true bravery when they see it,
but to expose a whole parish of 20,000
souls to the ravages of so dreadful a
scourge as yellow fever, and in violation
of law, shows a depravity utterly ap
palling. No good citizen would do such
an act, when every one was striving, at
every sacrifice, to protect the parish and
its people from the introduction of this
disease.
If yellow fever comes, it will be the
fault of those who violate the quarantine
regulations, and they will be morally
responsible for its consequences. Is
there a personl among them who. in that
sad event, which God forbid, will stand
up and face the wrath of this outraged
and mourning parish . The friends of
victims, the good citizen, will hold all
such to a fearful account-why, if the
fever comes, not only have we to fear
death, but the crop of the valley of Red
River will be an entire loss. The whites,
who are able will abandon their homes,
while the colored people will follow in
I[rge numbers.
Guards have been stationed at all
those points where communication with
yellow fever d;stricts is had, and we
look to the moral, manly and vigorous
snpport of all our good citizens to sus
tain us in this battle against di ease and
death,
Louisiana Republicans.
The great body of miscreants who
ruled Louisiana through fraud and
force for ten years, have been
pronounced by the northern people,
who supported them heretofore--as a
hand of most unmitigated scoundrels
with whom it were moral death to
associate. Notwithstanding this fact
these people are preparing to contest
this State against the great body (of
its material citizens. They have
called a convention for the 16th Sep
tember, and we suppose a full ticket
will be put in the field. Locally, the
same "old gaong," with the same "old
crowrt" of "bummers" are coming to
the front, and here even the proven
theives, liars and robbers have the
cheek to talk glibly with respectable
citizens of their "convention" and of
this nomination and that candidate.
if our people propose to allow
these fellows to rule them as tlhey have
in former times, they can do so by
apathy and by growling, but if they
propose to win the parish, which we
assure them is in the cards, let them
nnite solidly and go to the polls and
vote.
All over the State radical prepar
ations are maniflest. .There has been
no new names put to the front-the
battle will be between thie same con?
tending hosts-and it is the height of
folly for as to murmur. Natchitoches,
we are satisfied, will give a good ac
count of herself, and we hope the
same from every parish in this State.

t As Confederate war enminiscences
are the order of the day, here is one
D too good to lie buried. The hero of
Sthe joke we will call Jim. Ile was
attached to Rosser's Cavalry, in
Stuart's conmmand. Jim was noted
for his strong antipathy to shot and
shell, and a peculiar way he had of
t avoiding too close a communion with
dl the same, but at last all his plans
a failed to keep him out of the "row," c
and he, with his comrades, under a
Iientenant, was detailed to suippott a
Sbattery that composed a portion of
e the rear guard. The enemy kept
Y pressing so close, in fact, as to emhin
s ger the retreating forces, and the
t troops covering the retreat had or
I der's to keep lthe enemy ill check, for
1 a given periiod, at all hanz;ids, and
the orner was obeyed to the letter,
LI though under a galling tire. Our d
friend Jim grew desperate. He stuck
e behind trees that appeared to his ex
r cited vision no larger than ram rods
I He then tried lying down. In filet, c
, he Iplaced himself in every position
ºthat his genis could ilnvent, bit the
"hiss" of tl'e bullet haunted him still.
At last in despair, hle :,lled ito his
comlanding officer. ''Lieutenant !i
let's fall back !" "'I can not do it .li !"
h replied the olice'r. "Well I'll lie
h drat if we don't get cionned oult if we
s stay here !" "1My orders, Jim, are
to hold this place and support that
battery of guns," pointing to the at
tillery close by. "If we fall back the
enemy will rush in and captut e the
guns." Just at that time a well di
rected bullet impressed Jim with tile
i fact that a change of base hecanme
ii necessary. Jim found another ap
n parently protected spot, anl, as soon I
ats he recovered his Iin(l, he sang I
out: (i) ! Lieuntenant! what do yon
1 think them ere, canlnonls cost" "I
S don't know, Jim : I suppose a $l,NlOn."
"Well." said Jim, "let's take tp a
collection and pay for the d-d guns,
t and let the Yankees have em."
