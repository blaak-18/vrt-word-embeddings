Our batchers are beginning to wear
long faces-the advent of Lent is
the canuse.
Several prominent matrimonial
event will occur in this city after the
enten season has passed. So said.
Mrs, Galenie's gin-house with 100
bhales of cotton was consumed by fire last
week. Our reporter has been unable to
learn the particulars.
Get around to the polls bright and
early Tnesdly morning, challenge every
body you don't know and vote early and
as often as possible.
Our young friend Squire James Cald
well, was in town last week as one of
the delegates, representing Sabine in the
convention. Jim looks as fine as split
silk with them side boards be wears.
We call the attention of our City Fathers
to the side-walk in front of the old court.
house building. The Conncil should ap.
ply the remedy to that side-walk by
causing the loose bricks to be removed
if nothing more.

The demses of the city should clean
out their back-yards sand not wait for

THE WICED ONES&
F A Puglllstle Female-Too Much Love
for Shce Leather Causes a Lady
of Much Color to Jump the
Town-A Loud Mouthed
o Female.
Mary Elizabeth, a copper colored fe
male of too much lip, was pulled in by
n Officer Iludson, for using language nn.
becoming her sex. She tried to give his
honor a version on "Mary's Little Lamb,'
e but it didn't seem to have the soothing
etlect on his honor's mind that Mary
t thought it would have as he fined her
r $1.50 and costs just the same. She be
ing too high-toned refused to take quar
ters in the "cooler" by paying her fine.
This will cause prices in the laundry to
go up.
Josephine Burr, no relation to Aaron
Burr, but a genuine ginger-cake colored
female, for attempting to put a mule's
face on one of her sex, was collared by
Officer Hudson and brought before his
honor for trial. The prosecution having
failed to put in an appearance the afore
said Josephine was discharged.
Ester Thomas, a gazelle, as black as
cold tar, and by profession a performer
on the washboard and tub, appropriated
to her own use a pair ot bran new shoes
belonging to Mrs. Carter Burr. Com
plaint being made to his honor, officer
Hutson was ordered to bring the afore
said Easter before his tribunal. That
lady having been informed of the charges
against her jumped the town for parts
unknown to the police.
The Crops.
I To Farmers-Farmers in this section
of the country are requested to send in
a letter regarding the crops, weather, etc.
to enable the editor to give a correct
weekly report.]
The weather this week has been very
dry, at present writing it is cloudy and
warm with good prospects of a rain be- 1
fore morning which will be a blessing to
corn, which has not come up in some lo
calities, Mr. John R. Williams reports
his corn all up on his place and doing
tine. He carried the horns last year and
again be wins them this year. Reports
from tht Timon place state that the corn
is all up and the stand good.
In some parts of the parish farmers
entertain fears of having to plow up the
seed corn and of replanting if they are I
not blessed with a good shower this a
month.
We are glad to hear that work is going
on well, and the laborers have settled a
down to active and honest exertions to 4
make a crop, and put some money in (
their pockets, in which we cordially wish i
them great success.
Garden truck about town is not doing
very well owing to the numerous old
hens about the city.

united sentiments in saying: We are n

and heartfelt welcomes. Although her hand
could not aid you, her heart was with a

that are passed, has been oppression, de a

effort; with you and for you have onr
anxieties, our sympathies and our prayers
been blended dauring the trying ordeal
through which you have trinumphantly
passed. In the sacred eaunse of liberty *
we are alike interested with you. In its
preservation and perpetuation we with
you are equally identified, and for your
noble efforts in its cause which is alike T
the cause of woman, her garlands of af

of her heart-ever cherishing yaour mem
ory as noble defenders of the right and aI
brave aveogers of the wrong. C
Yo-you--Brave men, true to your qi
trust were the marked victimsof a cor- gl
rupt and partisan government. You ti
were the targets at which power, cor
ruption and persecution aimed. But
you were too high to reach-there was w
not enough strength in the bow to bring of
the arrow to the mark. IMenial and o
perjured hirelings have failed to attach
to your honored names the stigma ofl1
crime, and to your persons the odium of
punishment. The fair daughters of our

Before the presentation Mr. M. L. Dis

Prof. W. C. Jack delighted the audience
n with an address which was received with

s Esq., and Dr. G. E. Gillespie also made
remarks, and the pleasure of the evening
closed with the presentation of a hind

Buard to Mr. Charles Porter who res

We hear that our ladies are to present
banners to the Orleans and Washington

the motive and hope they will succeed.

Pedestriulsm.
I want to be a walker,
Yes, this is now the thing,
I want to get my muscles' up
And sail around the ring.
I want to win a champion belt
And make the people talk,
I want to hear the fellows shout
"Oh, golly, can't he waik?"
I want to beat O'Leary
t And wear a victor's smile,
For walking is, I understand,
All the latest style.
It seems that this city is about to
, be infected with the pedestrian ma
nia. A prominent young man in
this city who is well-known in social
circles informed our reporter that he
would wager be could walk 1,000
miles in 1,000 consecutive quarter
hours. Some of our young men
having heard of our young man's re
marks requested our reporter to
state through public print to the
, gentleman that a purse of $500
y awaits him in the way of a prize if
he thinks be can complete that task.
; Our young man will have to put him
I self in training, by taking long walks
every day at 5 a. m., and exercise on
I dumb-bells. We publish the follow
ing menu, which al! pedestrians apply
themselves to, for the benefit of our i
young man : "Jack-slaps buttered
with honey; mutton chops stuffed
with caper-sauce; shadowed soup
very thin; peeled rib roast, a la Se
cond street market. Drink very lit
tle Seltserewater-particelarly if it is
too highly colored."
The Lacoste Hall, we learna, has
already been spoken for, and shabould
"onr young man" accept the hebal I
lenge we will in oar next issue give '
the entire programme. The admis
sion will be 25e. Gate money to be

We notlee in the Vindicator a card t
signed by Mr. J. H. Pierson, u Chair- (
auan of the Senatorial Executive Com
mittee, whieh says that a meeting of
that Committee was held ina Coashat, t
ta on the 20th of February, and fur- 1
ther states that Messers. Breseale, of e
'Natchitoehes, Pierson, of Bed River,
and Presley of abline were present.
Now we have seen a private letter '
from Mr. Presley which says he was i
not present, so there is a mistake
somewhere. The action of the mem
bers from Natehitoches and Red River
are not binding opon the District, I
and thie Democrats of DeSoto do not a
recognize their authority in the pre- t
mises. Therefore, ano Convention
will be held to nominate candidates
for this Senatorial District.
In reply to which we submit the
following letters. We think comr

vindictiveness of the witnesses, was

lence and infamy of the District At
torney, Mr. Leonard. This popy,
cock. born of the South, and a Judas
to his section without his virtue, act,
ed throghout in a spirt of pure and
unadulterated viciousness. His ven
om culminated only with the verdict,
and that verdict was "His Country's
Curse-his chdldrens shame, and made
him the out-cast of virtue, peace and
fame."
Mr. Leonard, you had your brief
hour on the floor of that Court room.
You treated your people with the ma
levolence and brutality of a savage ;
you insulted them with the infamy of
a coward of power. You made your
self the persecutor for, the aider and
companions of house-burners, and of
those who would have deluged our
hearth-stones with the blood of our
women and children.
We will remember you for it, and
as sure as God lives, that hour of
your brutality will be revenged to
your sorrow.
May yea live execrated and die
damned.

Complexion of jury, eleven colored,
about three black, others mulattoes;
five whites, one democrat, four republi

no ease. Judge charged directly for ac
quittal. Jury stood, eight for acquittal
and four for conviction without evidence.
Jury discharged till twenty-fifth when
Teasas case is fixed. It may be tried but
I am satisfied no other case will be.
Leonard authorized me to telegraph
Scruggs' party not to come as case would
not be tried. Dranguet is authorized to
