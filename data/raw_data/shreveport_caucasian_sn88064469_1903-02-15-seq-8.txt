MANAGER SHARP.
Arrested and Charged With Intent to
Kill.
There was much excitement about the
headquarters of the Cumberland Tele
phone Company yesterday. Early in the
day a man named Sam Norris, a striker
who had been dogging Manager Sharp
and had applied rough epithets to him,
was finally ordered to desist, but con
tinuing his ugly remarks Manager Sharp
armed himself with a pistol, crossed the
street, met Norris on the sidewalk, with
whom he exchanged but a few words
when he hit Norris a blow with his fist.
As Norris made a motion as if to draw
a weapon Sharp was ready and then and
there ended the trouble. Sharp was re
leased on bond.

LAW AND ORDER.
Citizens Aroused to Action As
semble in Mass Meeting.
DENOUNCE UNLAWFUL ACTS
Whereby The Lives and The Property
of The People are Threatenued.
A Demand for the Resigation <(0 Fdge
C. i). Htick. Was Adopted ° nani
:;cu-l- by h lany Citizens.
The citizens cl Sltrevepore wire
moved yesterday to the highest degree of
resentment, and it was a resentmentaris
ing from the realization of the danger
they had escaped from the unlawful acts
of miscreants which threatene* their
property and their lives.
Until Saturday morning :* citizens
knew that the initial step to anarchy had
been inaugurated in their city, and when
citizens belated at their offices or their
clubs Friday night relate) their experi
ence with tangled wires this gesentment
was intensified. 14 was such an outrage
as had never been experienced in the his
tory pf this city. One gentleman, an eld
erly friend of the Caucasian, stated that
he reached his home in the nick of time
and believed that if he ha* been later
his home would have caught fire from a
wire which had become charge* with
deadly electricity. When this outlawry
was made known citizens were called h
the Board of Trade at noon where this
dastardly work was denounced in un
measured terms. The Boar* of Trade
room was crowdet and from there it
wits adjourned to the opera house at 5
p.m. It should be stated that at this
meeting of the Board of Trade there was
introduced a resolution, unanimously
carried, demanding the resignation of
Judge C. D. Hicks, and at the same
meeting there was presented a list of the
names of men who are alleged to have
aided and abetted'in this outlawry. The
citizens in a body, numbering a hundred
or more, headed by Captain Peter You
ree, president of the Commercial Na
tional Bank, followed by leading busi
ness men, march to the headquarters
of the Cumberland Telephone Company,
from the porch of ihich Captain Youree
read a list of men who were ordered out
of town. It may be said that the excite
ment increased at every step. Nor did it
allay until late in the afternoon.
The meeting at the opera house, with
Peter Youree chairman, was a flemon
stration for law and order agains dis
order and anarchy. Hon. E. H. Railolph
and -Hon. J. H. Shepherd made telling
speeches becoming the occasion. The
president of the. Electrical Workers
Unieon desired to speak and explained
that his men have had no, connection
with the outlawry, but when questioned
he admitted that he had no interest in
the Cumberland Telephone Connpaiy or
in the city but was interested in the
union's welfare. He may n:,t have meant
it in the spirit in which he spoke his
words but he left an impression on many
of his hearers which was not favorable.
The meeting at the opera house wafmied
up to the adoption of ai resolution pro
viding for the immediate organization ot
"A Law and Order League," and there
w-as distributed a number of badges in
dicating the spirit and the purple for
which they are to be worn. Such is the
gist of what occurred yesterday as a
demonstration by citizens aroused to
ac! on.
But how was the plot to deal dlestruc
tion discovered ?
Fortunately, Mr. Querbes. in his ca
pacity as mayor, was advised through a
mysterious medium of what was design
ed. At first he was incredulous, but he
started on an investigation arnd when he
reached West Shreevport he was con
fronted with the cowardly, the dastardly
work of destmuction. It should be said
that as soon as he was advised by the
mysterions medium of this scheme (f de
struction, he communicated with Chief
of Police Jones who was ready for ef
fective work in a few'minutes. and hav
Dr. HIumphreys.
After fy years Dr. Humnphreys'
peeiflca aejoy the grestast popularity
and largest sale ip their history, due to
intrinsea merit. They care the sick.

i-.ies holding the bigstcavy poles of the
Cumlnterland Telephone Company had

ptrcr at th. plant of the Shreveport
! r::Ction C ntpany. It wa a nm'ove which
e h: fully appreciated onIy by tiuoe
i, can reach the rcali ati:tn. tf the dan
perhaps fatally. And then think of the
tires, of the death of innocent people
from contact witlt*lephone wirestet
ing on or hanging from trolley wires
chargedl with deadly electricity.
"1"o Mayor Querhes and his mysterius
adviser all credit is due: due to the
mayor i*r his prompt action, his Dili
geitce alitd his vigilance; due to the ntvs
teriousltan who realized what threaten
ed an. wiho while unwilling to divulge
lhis name would not permit the destruc
tion of property, the danger ireatening
the lives c$ innocent men and women
1 ant children.
I is this mysteriaus adviser a lineman?
he a union man ? f he(new did oth
ers know, and if others knew why did
they not do as hlie did? Or why did they
not raise theirfands again.a crime the
contemplation of possible4sults so dire
as@~ make one's flesh ti\*fort he
t thinking over 0
Alnd yet only onelian was caught, red
handed, at this diabolical, this dastardly
t work of destruction, and that man is 9S
1 Huckles. He was arrested by #ficer
r George Hull and a hill of inforllation
SIas been fil. again: him f)r cutting
wires +i the poles of the tunmberland
Telephone Sompany l Huckles is an elec
trical worker who. while a@nion mlan.
ihas, it has been alleged, ni connection
with the local Union. WVill the local In
ion denounce, his act ? Will the local
Union assist in his prosecution, in their
own vindication as law-abiding citizens?
E Will the local Union repudiate this act
of anarchy ?
The fight between the linemen and the
Cumberland Telephone Company is no
concern of the Caucasian. We believe
1 that all men should strive to better
- their conditions within reasonable
- bounds. In the contentions bet een the
- strikers and the Cumberland we have
s had little to say and have left to the
legal authorities the settlement of per
sonal disputes and fights, but when a
t crisis such as confronts the good law
- abiding citizens is reached there is then
t but one course to follow, and that is the
course suggested to every honest man,
I Law and Order. Before this violent
demon trations public sentiment was
with the strikers, hut this kindly feeling
I has been reversed by one of fear and
apprehension.
Unionism is not outlawry. It is not
s anarchy. ,Union measures have won in
I lawful pursuits of legitimate ends. Un
i ions which will not stand for law and
I order must be repudiated. That at least
I is one of the cardinal principles which
have given power and influence to the
leader Mitchell in his fight agaifist the
t coal barons. It Unionism will ngt de
Inounce outlawry it should perish as it is
not entitled to or is worthy of the sup
port of men who favor law and order
I over ouitlawry and anarchy. Peace, law
and order must and shall prevail. The
loyal, the lawful citizens of Shreveport,
bankers and merchants, the clerks at the
counter .or desk. andi the ditchers and
'day workers as well are in favor of law
atldorder. Law and order shall triumph
I and must he niaintained at any cost.
