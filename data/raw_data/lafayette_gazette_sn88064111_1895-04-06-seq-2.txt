REDUC'TION OF TAXES.
i One way to reduce taxation is to
~educe expenses and this latter is
'the subject of the present article.
-The running expenses of the parish
.has been for several years $So,ooo
sund a reduction is demanded by the
stringent times. It is true the bud
get committee has made a splendid
step in this direction by cutting the
estimates for the current year some
$2300oo, yet The Gazette would sug
gest that the good work be carried
cn still further. The keeping and
feeding of criminals in the parish jail
is one of the heaviest burdens im
posed upon the people, and if pos
sible, steps should be taken to cur
tail expenses along this line. The
jailer's fees sometimes amount to
over $aoo per month-always in
neighborhood of $xoo. Pris
must be cared for, the jailer
s be paid, but the people must
: protect themselves in the adminis
. Atration of their affairs. To this
;-send let the Grand Jury consult the
district attorney next week and if
=legal, call every justice of the peace
in the parish, and instruct them,
that whenever a person accused of
breach of contract, carrying con
-cealed weapons, or any other minor
offense, shall fail to furnish bond
for appearance before the district
court it shall be the duty of the
justice to allow the prisoner the
privilege accorded by law, of sign
ing his own recognizance. It
does not seem reasonable or fair
that a man should be cast into
prison on some trivial charge
oftentimes upon mere suspicion,
and kept there for months, at the
expense of the parish not to say
anything of the demoralization to
the prisoner himself. Instances are
too common of prisoners kept for
months on petty charges only to be
discharged by the Grand Jury or
some light sentence imposed for a
trivial offense. The writer has in
mind, a case where Judge Allen
very properly so passed sentence
upon a prisoner as to provide for
his immediate discharge. Should
the proposed method of dealing
with prisoners be inaugurated and
established, there can be no doubt
as to its efficacy in reducing ex
penses, probably to the extent of
$rooo per annum. No harm can
result trom the possible escape of a
few petty criminals who might
evade punishment. The matter is
submitted to the serious considera
tion of the Grand Jury.
With an approximate reduction
of expenses say of $3000, plus $3000
revenue from licenses, the total
taxes on property would be reduced
from $z8,6oo to about $13,000.
Assuming that the total assessment
remains at $2,ooo,ooo it is very
plain that the rate of taxation may
be safely reduced to seven mills on
the dollar-a reduction of three
mills. Some complaint has been
made as to the assessment being to
high, but a careful examination will
prove otherwise. There may be a
few instances of excessive assess
ment but very few indeed. The
trouble is that large property-owners
do not give in all they possess.
Equalization is of far greater im- 1
portance. Almost the entire re
sponsibility rests upon the assessor,
who, as a State Officer, should be
above dictation He should fix
valuation and include everything
from the records, and if there be
any disagreement the owner may
appear before the Board of Re
viewers (Police Jury) and have
rectified any injustice inflicted.
Let this be done and the property
valuation instead of being two
mnilhlons will shortly be double that
amount, thus enabling the author
ities to reduce the rate of taxation
-:to a minimum.

efor The Gazette. 0
Woman uffrage.
Suppose suffrage to be secured.
r What would follow its train? Giv
ing the matter casual considerationi
only, one thinks that the great cen
ters of wrong-doing would be
purified, that woman's presence in
- great political gatherings, her influ
ence in legislative halls, her ballot
against-the crying evils of the day
and her united and legalized effort
for the salvation of the young,
would work such reform as to thrill
and regenerate the world from cen
ter to circumference. But look
deeper. In the home, the source
of all good to the State, would
surely come sooner or later dis
cussions, divisions and dissensions.
There would inevitably be two sides
and these, in many instances, hotly
contested. It is an old saying that
a man and his wife should not play
chess. Surely it is a graver ques
tion whether they should play at
the dangerous game of politics.
Aside from the vital considera
tion and others 'which will suggest
themselves, lurks one which seems
to have attracted little attention.
The admission is universal that the
ballot, in its present state of abuse,
with its votes bought and sold and
controlled by other corruptinginflu
ences, has had the most demoraliz
ing effect upon men; their standards
of morality have been lowered,
their ideals contaminated. What
of woman? Is she human and yet
utterly impervious to temptation?
The glory of womanhood has been
her purity, her superiority to man
in the possession of a higher moral
sense and standard. Why risk this
precious certainty for a doubtful
good, when the superiority claimed
and admitted by all is the result of
protection from the temptations
which this doubtful good would en
tail? Unmolested her instincts and
feelings would undeniably lead in
the right direction; as a class her
predilections would be upward
tending. But vest her with a power
of marketable value, a power of
immediate importance and offering
a motive to man, and how many
a weak woman would be dominated
by a stronger nature.
This may appear harsh and cruel
as an argument advanced by a
woman against women. But let -it
be distinctly apprehended that it
is a reflection not upon woman but
upon human nature, a sad and re
gretful admission that in so many
instances it cannot or does not
withstand temptation, and that in
this matter, added to many other
weighty reasons, that of protection
from corrupting influences should
be seriously considered. Then, it
may be asked, if political equality
of the sexes be not a remedy for
ills known and deplored, where
shall one be found? And the an
swer would be, in the regenerating
work which is going forward with
rapid stride in all parts of the
world; in the higher education of
women which fits them to apply
and utilize in their homes, in their
influence with husbands, brothers
and sons, the intelligence gained;
in their power to direct the votes of
those nearest and dearest for the
accomplishment of the uplifting of
society. This may seem slow in
method and practical results, but it
is safe. Only an intel:igent woman
could hope so to influence, and she
who is not intelligent had best have
no influence either to exert or to
barter.-Annah R. Watson, in the
Arena, Boston, February.
The Autocrat and Dr. Johnson.
Walter Blackburn Harte, whose
book of genial lively essays, "Mled
itations in Miotley," is having a
considerable vogue among book
lovers, contributes a vivid and fan
ciful paper in the March Arena
called "'The Autocrat at the Old
Fogies' Club," which will attract
wide attention on account of its
subject. It pictures the introduc
tion of Dr. Holmes to Dr. Johnson
and the wits of the Club at the
Mitre in Elysiumrn, and includes a
racy criticism of The Autocrat's
literatur:e which is put into the
mouth of Dr. Johnson. It is a
most dainty and novel compliment
to the memory of The Autocrat,
and will satisfy his warmest ad
mirers as an artistic bit of Imagina
tive work.
Here is the Secret.
"How do you account for the
success of MUNSEv'S MlAGAZINE?" is
a question everywhere asked. It is
asked among publishers, in the
club, in the home. It is asked of
us every day. The secret is simply
this: TUc a-re m:.ki,,bg a m,,ag',zine

COULD GET DRUV.NK EV.ERY
DA Y.
Gen. Armstrong, Assistant Com
missioner of Indian Affairs, thinks
that Andrew Jackson was one of the
greatest men this country ever pro
duced, and has a number of stories
which were told him by his uncle,
who was an intimate friend of Old
Hickory. One of them is very
characteristic of the man.
Lewis Cass, Secretary of WVar
was over at the White House one
day with some important papers for
the President to sign, among them
being a court martial findings.
"Cass, what is this?" inquired
Jaskson, as he was about to write
his name to the document.
'"It is a court-matial," answered
Cass.
,"What have I to do with it?"
asked the Pressident.
SIt dismisses an officer from the
service, and the President must
sign such orders."
Jackson toyed with the paper and
said, musingly: "Dismissed from
the army, eh?" Why?"
,"Drunkenness; getting drunk
and falling, down on parade, or
something of that kind," answered
the Secretary.
"Who ordered the court?" asked
Jackson.
*"Gen. Scott," answered Cass.
"'Who is it?" inquired the Plesi
dent, with more interest.
"Inspector General Kraum," re
plied Secretary Cass.
"'What?" shouted Jackson, "my
old friend Col. Kraum! Cass, just
read what that paper says."
The Secretary read the usual
form of the court martial sentence
in such cases. The President then
took the paper and wrote across the
bottom where he was about to sign
his name:
"The within findings are disap
proved, and Col. Kraun is restored
to his duty and rank."
He passed the paper back to Se
cretary Cass, and said with his
usual vehemence:
"By the eternal Cass, when you
and Scott serve your country as
well as that man has you can get
drunk on duty every day.
Marvelous Results.
From a letter written by Rev. J. Gunder
man, of Dimondale, Mich., we are permit
ted to make this extract: "I have no hesita
tion in recommending Dr. King's New
Discovery, as the results were almost mar
velous in the case of my wife. While I
was pastor of the Babtist Church at Rives
Junction she was brought down with
Pneumonia succeeding l.a Grippe. Ter
rible paroxysms of coughing would last
hours with little interruption and it seemed
as if she could not survive them. A
friend recommended Dr. King's New
Dsicovery; it was quick in its work and
highly satisfactory in results" Trial bottles
ree at \Vm. Clegg's lDrug Store
There was a time when lie wh'i would
keep informed of the progress of kno wl ed ge.
the record of discovery and inventiton, and
the currents of h,lmn:n thought, cou.bl and
indeed must rely chicily if not wholly upon
books. That day has passed:. IBooks we
must still read, as the crystallization and
permanent embodiment of huma.n thought
and knowledge. But to-day it is the news
paper, the magazine, the p-rio~dical review,
upon which we nlust chiefly dlepcn-I if we
would follow closely the intellectual move
ment of the day. And now a new dilicnulty
has arisen. This newspaper and periodical
literature has become so multitu.iinouts and
bulky as to be a heavy hberlcn to the busy
man or woman, while even the person who
has leisure and inclination to read widely
is often unable to get access to the curre'nt
publications. Especially in the smaller
cities, villages, and rural districts is the
lack of such opportunity felt. It is felt by
the clergyman, the teacher, the lawyer, the
physician, the merchant, the artisan, the
farmer and the cultured and thoughtful
practical literary question is: With all
these and many other classes of persons the
great practical literary question is: I-low
can I best supplement my indispensiltle
home papef? It was to answer this ques
and meet this demand that PUBI.C OPIN
ION (now published in New York City)
was founded nine years ago. It selects the
best, condenses it to the last degree, and
serves it in convenient and attractive form.
