the opening of the world's fair early

the press clubs of New York. Boston
and various cities and states of the
United States and of the authorities of
the LIuisiana Purchase exposition.
At the eighth annual press congress
held at Berne last summer Walter
Williams, the editor of the Columbia
(Mo.) Herald and press commissioner
for the St. Louis world's fair, being
given full authority, invited the editors
from all countries then assembled in the
federal palace of the Swiss republic to
hold their next meeting on American
soil. The invitation was accepted with
enthusiasm.

quite natural that St. Louis should fol

*aines 1' Connolly, author o**ie
volume of sea stories entitled A)ut of
Gloucester," seems to be conling in for
a deal of attention. It may be said, in
deed. that Mr.*'onnolly has literally
leaped into fame. since that renowned
jump of his whlichi won the highest
prize in the first athletic event at the
Olyminli ii ganes in Athens several
years ago higures so prominently in the
conteimplation of his person(iity anod
achievemienits. The combination of an
international athlatie champion and a
successful writer of hetion is apparent
ly irresistible to the-bookish world.
U'ndoulte ily the physical prowess of
the young Bostonian was not without
its effect in commending lhim to Presi

national executive loves brain and
brawn with an equal love. it is easy
to believe that more than a passing
thought of the record breaking Olym
plan leap made by Connolly was in the
president's mind when. after a delight

wrote a letter of warm congratulation
to the author.
Henry Seton Merriman (Hugh Scott),
author of "The Vultures," will not per
mit the publication of his portrait, and
the nearest idea the public has of his
appearance is gathered front the state

Stevenson.
"Really," remarked a friend of this
author. "if Scott would turn down
his collars and his hair (which he
.'years boot brush fashions. the likeness
to it. L. S. would be striking."
He Is further described as "tall and
long limbed, careless is regards clothes,
lazy as regards movement. with the
same sharpness of feature and bril
liance of eye that suggested delicacy in
Stevenson: the same humorous curve
of the month. nad in rare moments of

look of doom."
