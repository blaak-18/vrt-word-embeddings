not force us to have confidence in
him. John must go. We have had
enough of him.
That he will go, is a foregone con
clusion.
But the next question of impor
tance is: Shall Duckworth name his
successor?
Boys, get ready, we must fight, or
else we are on the western slope of
time.

• A UNION MAN.
ANOTHER FARMERS’ UNION MAN
INTERESTED.
My Dear Sir:—Allow me space
enough in your paper to express my
thanks for your weekly, of which
1 subscribed for a short while ago;
my only regret about the paper is
that I did not subscribe sooner. You
have in this short length of time put
me on to some things that before I
knew nothing about, and I feel un
der a debt of gratitude to you for
having enough regard for right to
put it in its true light before the
people. I admire greatly the way
in which you are hammering some
of the Union officials. Keep it up!
We farmers need all the information
that you can give us about the offi
cial crookedness and unwise, hurt
ful and deceitful ways in which they
are practicing upon the poor and in
nocent farmer. I am glad to say
that you have lifted gently the cap
of ignorance from my clouded eyes,
and it is only a question of time
when all the farmers of Georgia will
have to lend a hearing ear to the
doctrines you are so faithfully and
untiringly pursuing, because you are
right in denouncing those guilty offi
cials. The reason that I give for
thinking so is simply this: the si
lence that they are enduring under
your hard hitting attacks is sufficient
to warrant my steadfast belief. Ido
hope that you may be successful in
running these officials to earth, and
ridding the Union of all unclean
officers. You are setting the pace
which will have its effect.
May you be enabled to keep up
your persistent attacks upon all
measures that are not for the wel
fare of the people. You are running
hot the trail of Catholicism, Social
ism and Missionism, and all other
isms that you can, with your mighty
foresight, see that are not what will
prove of value to your people. Some
may curse you, but time will vindi
cate you in the sight of your unbe
lievers. Time will crown you as the
“champion of these issues’’ that you
are denouncing. All hail your teach
ings, is my earnest desire.
I remain, with the highest esteem,
JOE L. SULLIVAN.

BRO. JOHNSON WANTS TO KNOW.
Dear Sir: —An article in The Jef
fersonian, Thursday, February 24th,
says, “We want things put right at
the next State Convention,” signed
by F. M. Smith, secretary. What do
you want put right? You should
have named some things you would
have put right, Bro. Smith; I think
you had better come back in the
fold and serve your country and
children, or get from astride the
fence. Stick to your obligation. One
man in the Union kicking can do
more harm than ten on the outside.
Remember, my brother, you can not
hold God in one hand and Mammon
in the other. Stand for home, stand
for country, honor; stand by your
guns, let others say what they
please.
Your brother in the Union and
friend in the work,
J. J. JOHNSON.
Sylvester, Ga., Rt. 1.
ADDRESSES OF SEVERAL ASKED
FOR BY BROTHER.
Dear Sir:—The following request
was sent to our (?) “Union News,”
but being a paper that has a “Na
tional Circulation,” of course it could
not afford to burden its columns with
such “local matters,” consequently I
beg of you to allow me to endeavor
to secure the information through
your columns.
The Union News, Union City, Ga.
Dear Sirs:—Desirous of obtaining
the address of the following parties,
I ask you to kindly allow me to ask
for the same through the columns of
your paper.
The following brethren are re
quested to send me their addresses:
E. O. Gunn, W. E. Coker, R. L. Bar
ron, C. G. Pressley, J. L. Cowan and
G. M. Davis.
Yours for business,
S. J. COWAN.
Swainsboro, Ga., Feb. 14, 1910.
Not hearing anything from the
above letter I sent the following, and
to date have received no reply, not
even gotten my stamp back.
Swainsboro, Ga., March 1, 1910.
The Union News, Union City, Ga.
Dear Sir and Brother:—About ten
days ago I sent you a notice to insert
in your columns, and I am herewith
enclosing stamp for the return of
said notice, provided you are not go
ing to publish same.
Yours truly,
S. J. COWAN.
THE LETTER OF I-WANT-IT
AGAIN.
(You’d never suspect from this
letter that Thetus is not now in Con
gress.)
My Dear Sir: —I am sending you,
under separate cover, two speeches
—one delivered by myself on the
Supremacy of the Constitution, and
one by Representative Sims, of Ten
nessee, on the “Value of Long Serv
ice in Congress.” I hope these
speeches will reach you in due
course, and that you will find them
interesting.
Early in December last, I ordered
some vegetable seed sent to your ad
dress, and I trust you have received
them before this. If for any reason,
however, you failed to receive them,
let me know, and I will order an
other assortment for you. Within
the next few days, I will have some
of the publications of the same de
partment sent to you.
Hoping that these will prove of
value and interest, and assuring you
of my readiness at all times to serve
you, I am,
Yours sincerely,
I-WANT-IT-AGAIN.
Washington, D. C.
Comment: Speeches on the Constitu
tion; the newspaper-clipping of
Thetus; some vegetable seed —there
you are. That’s all such M. C.’s are
capable of.

“BOLL WEEVIL” IS THE ACORN
WEEVIL.
Dear Sir: —Seeing so much said
about the boll weevil, that is so
much dreaded by the cotton growers
of the Southern States, and through
all the investigations that have been
made by the Government and noth
ing definite discovered as to his ori
gin or where he came from, I want
to say he is here to stay, and I will
give for the information of all con
cerned his origin. The boll weevil
is the common acorn weevil that
ruins our sweet acorns very often. I
had heard so much said about the
boll weevil and his destruction in
the cotton fields of Texas, and as I
made a visit to my brothers in Lime
stone county, Texas, two years ago
last fall, and I examined the boll
weevil to find out what he was and
where he came from, and I found he
was no stranger to me as I had seen
many of them among sweet mast.
And now for the cause of them tak
ing the cotton fields of Texas: it be
came almost a cotton field and those
weevils must have something to sub
sist on, used that little spear that
they spiked the sweet acorns with
and spiked the bolls of cotton and
drew all the life out of them and
was called the boll weevil. I will
just ask old men, who have lived in
3ejfersontan
the rural districts and have had ex
perience with the acorn weevil, to in
vestigate and they will soon be con
vinced of the truth of what I have
said. If you think this will be of
any benefit to the farmers and Union
men, you can publish it in your pa
per. I can make proof if needed.
