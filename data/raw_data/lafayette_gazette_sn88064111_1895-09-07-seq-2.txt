` yWhen a Democrat is afraid of

what is the natural conclusion It
can not be that he is strong in his

support what is the irresistible
conclusion ?
The New Orleans States con
cludes an able editorial by wisely
stating that the missionaries had
better stay-at home to pursue their
-laudable work there than to go to
>thina and get their goverment in
trouble in attempting to christianize
a few rat-eating heathens.
The latest news from our editor
who is now in Salt Lake City, is to
the e-ect that he has, up to date,
receIved twenty-seven proposals to
save the souls of these respective
Mormon maidens. In a postcript
he adds that their ages range from
19s to 79years. We always felt that
if be ever had the opportunity he
woukld demonstrate his "fetchiness"
--the older the subject the greater
his power.-St. Martin Messenger.
From the above it will be seen that
our friend, Bob Bienvenu, has been
p aying the very mischief in the
Mormon country. While we are sor
ry that he has not yet learned to
behave when away from home, we
are extremely happy to see that he
has not lost that "fetchiness" which
has never failed to make him a fa
vorite among the softer sex.
It is not s ". All politicians are
not dishonest. Unfortunately too
many can not be trusted, but it is
unreasonable to say that as soon as
a man enters what is commonly
kaown as politics he must be
branded with infamy. Some of
them are dishonest, but then there
are some dishonest merchants, dis
honest doctors, printers, and even
dishonest ministers are found some
times. We hear too much of this
skeptidism when politics or politi
clatss are in question. Look around
you, and think of the men who have
been politicians and you will readily
see the injustice of this general de
nu|ciation. When you hear a man
denounce all politicians, perhaps a
passing glance at his own career
might not be altogether fruitless.
A VICTORY FOR IARfMONY.
By an overwhelming majority the
silver Democrats of Caddo parish
have decided-that the financial ques
tion must be kept out of State
politics. Out of 6oo voters 5oo were
of the opinion thino at Blanchard, the
brilliant young senator, was right,
a.jd that our good and plucky
friend, Cal Hicks, was wrong. The
victory, which was won under the
mastchless leadership of Blanchard,
i indeed a hopeful sign; it shows
that the Democratic voters are afraid
Sthe disastrous consequences that
will surely follow in the wake of
party division. The tenor of the
ueeptutions and the large majority
btwhich they were adopted evince
bejond doubt that the sturdy Demo
craqeof Caddo is not disposed to
inject a purely national issue in
State politics and thereby endanger
*the success of the only party that I
San be depended upon to give to the
.-people of Louasiana a government
~i der which it is possible for a
wbrt man to live. The Democrats
i ccnddo have joined those of La
-t e and other parishes in refus- i

i Bhianchard, who is a con
i lst, spoke to the 3
he votd on the
aistaken. He called
oto the condition of i
fortress of a
ei t danger
hley, whoi in a speech theaothe ay,
ý" declared himself in" favor of the
passage of a law similar to the one
recently enacted by the New York
Republicans, guaranteeing to ne
groes equal rights in hotels, restau
rants, barber-shops and bath-houses.
The Democratic party in the blue
grass State seems hopelessly split
on the financial question and the
wrangling between goldbugs and
silverbugs continues with increasing
intensity, regardless of the serious
consequences that invariably fol
low such a suicidal policy. What
is going on in Kentucky we will see
in Louisiana, unless the Democrats
take a commonsense view of the
situation.
POLITICAL.
There was a political meeting at
Falk's hall last Monday. We do
not know its purposes and inten
tions; but suffice to say that it was
profoundly "anti," being opposed
to everything except "a change."
This latter was, it appears, one of
f the stringent necessities of the fu
5 ture. Some Democrats were not
t allowed to enter the hall while
5 others were received with open
d arms. This struck some people as
s peculiar and was vary much com
c mented upon. The meeting was
evidently not held to "save the
Democratic party" but it was prob
ably called to "save the country,"
I which, they would have-us- believe,
r is going to the ,"demnition bow
, wows" since a certain number of
gentlemen are "out of jobs" as
Ingalls would say it. One present
office-holder, in particular, is held
responsible for all the ills imagin
able, and of course, if the political
scalp of this unfortunate individual
is not tomahawked, nothing short
of an old-time miracle will save the
t republic from complete dissolution.
Some Democrats were denied
admittance because they were not
'opposed to the re-election of Sheriff
Broussard. ",Pro-Isaac" or "anti
Isaac"- seems to have been the
pass-word. It did not matter if
your Democracy was as white as
the lily and pure as that of ,"Old
Hickory," you could not gain ad- I
mittance to the sacred domain of
Faf's hall unless you possessed the I
additional qualification of being
"agin Ike." Why the sheriff is
made the object of so much fierce
opposition the majority of the peo
ple of Lafayette do not understand.
It seems that the speakers dwelt
particularly upon the crying need
of "a change." It would have
been interesting perhaps to have
had the speakers suggest the names
of those they desired "changed in,"
if we are allowed the expression.
It is rumored that the object of
the meeting is to nominate a ticket
for district, parish and ward officers,
independently of the action of the
party. The Gazette refuses to be
lieve this rumor as some men con
nected with the move have always
been warm advocates of party
nominations, especially by prima
ries.
As this paper had no representa
tive present we take the following
account of the meeting from the
Picayune:
Lafayette, La,. Sept. 2.-(Spe
cial.)-- The first open demonstra
tion of the anti-administration fac
tion was made at Falk's Hall to-day, I
when some fifty men from various I
parts of the parish held a
meeting to formulate a ticket for all I
parochial and ward officers. The I
meeting was he:d behind closed
doors and none but anti-adminis
tration men were admitted. Judge
Debaillon called the meeting to or
der. Organisation was perfected -
by electing A. ~. Labbe as chair
man and Dr. F WV. Courtney and
A. Bacque as secretaries. Several S
speeches were made by Messrs.
Wim. Campbell, Jos. A. Chargois I
and others, expressing very strong U
convictions as to thie success of the f,
movement at the next general elec- a
tion.
An executive committee, consis- '
ting of Jasper Spell, W. J. Harris
son, D. Arcenaux, Edward Jenkins,
D. A. Cocnrane, Sosthene Breaux,
A. Primeaux, Lucien Broussard, A. P
D. Girouard, Norbert Reaux, Dr.
J. P. Francez, Jacques Gilbert, Wm. n
Beadle, S. Bernard, C. Doucet, u
Alcide Judcie, WVm. Campbell, W.
B. Torian, P. B. Roy, Em le Pre
jean, Hen Avant, Mi. Melancon and
Judge C. Debaillon, were appointed r
to formulate a ticket, to be sub- A
mitted to a mass meeting in the fu
ture. T'he committee will meet
Monday next to effect the desired L
object. The Lafayette Advertiser N
was chosen the official journal of "
the faction, and the meeting ad
journed.
STRAIGHT DEtMOCRACY. A
In these days of dickers and com- w
blunes when men are willing to
Wtr into unholy alliances for the
sak.c of office, it does good to bne's
r heart to read such sound Demo
a cratc doctrine as will be found in
t' following letter recently pub
.Iced in that straightest of all
e Democratic journals, The New Or
e leans States:
c Editor States--With reference to
the recent exhibition of rowdyism
in Cuffy's headquarters, the office of
Major Andrew Hero, in Commer
cial place during which the sable
- statesmen (?) Demas and Blount
t pummelled each other in true hood
lumistic style, ,[ would ask the
Populists and other malcontent
Democrats, whether the henchmen
and followers of these political free
5 booters and parasites are to be
- taken, metaphorically, to their
t bosoms as auxiliary in their insane
efforts to defeat the Democratic
party and relegate our beloved State
in the tender mercies of the negroes
and their mercenary blood-sucking
allies, the carpet-baggers, from
whose ruthless domination of mis
rule and plunder we escaped only
t by the sacrifice of precious blood
and untold treasure ?
Although much has been said and
written in disparagement of our
present State and city adminstra
tions, and granting, for argument's
sake, that much that is charged is
true, yet it were far better tq en
dure for eternity, if need be, the
evils we have than resort to any un
t holy alliances or combinations that
would tend in the slightest degree
to the restoration to political con
trol of the old time, ever to be
anamathized Radical Republican
cohorts.
If we have grievances-and I
grant we have-let us settle them
ourselves,, within the ranks of the
Democratic party and without seek
ing or accepting extraneous aid.
Within its ranks is safety and
honor; without, danger to institu
tions, oppression, rapine and po
litical ruin. Truly your,
STRAIGHT DEMOCRAT.
