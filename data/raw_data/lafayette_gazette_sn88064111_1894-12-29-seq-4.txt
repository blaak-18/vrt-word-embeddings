THE NAPOLEON REVIVAL.
Why the iEmperor to the Most Pepalas
Character tI Miiatary.
Within the past year there has been
a revival of interest in the career of
Napoleon Bonaparte that is almost
phenomenal. In literature he has flg
ured in the pages of memoirs and rem
iniscences by those who came into
more and less intimate contact with
him. In art not only has he been a po
tent inspiration to modern painters
and sculptors, but he has made price
less all pictorial recordsof his time. In
the drama he poses as the most pictur
esque figure that has been brought
upon the stage within the century.
P'ersonal relies of the man are held as
sacred and beyond all price. As Paul
BIourget aptly says, "'Napoleon has
hypnotized the French people again."
In France the sting of defeat after
tihe Franco-Prussian war turned the'
thoughts of all to their period of great
est glory. and so it needed but time to
see Napnlscon enshrined as an idol. An
equally logical explanation is found
for the most niotable feature of the Na
poleon revival in this country.
7The (Cet-,trty'a life of the emperor was
projected fire or six years ago, before
anyone could have foreseen the pres
ent attitude of tile public mind. It
was undertaken solely with the idea
that Napoleon was one of the greatest,
most forceful and picturesque charac
ters in the entire range of history, and
that hitherto he had been inadequate
ly re-presented. For that reason Prof.
William M. Sloane. the greatest Amer
ican: student of IFrench history, was
coiullnissioned to write the life. and
his. years of study among unpublished
Sarcaliv..-s h;ave brought out his com
pleted llabor at the nmost opportune mo
un-ut. And Prof. Sloane shows us a
nme\" Napoleon, a devourer of books. an
unnulce~ssnl literary aspirant, an iuef
eetual Co(um-iemn political agitator. but
the new Napoleon certainly nmakes the
old Naplcon more easily compre
hended.

THE FARMING WORLD.
GOOD DAIRY RATIONS.
ise Thant is Oaietlaetod s lacase a
Oeed loew of IMlk.
The best ration is generally the one
that induces a liberal low of milk. Jt
has not been found praotieable to take
a cow giving thin milk, and by select
ing her ration ebonge this into rioh
milk. Of course, very sueeulent food
is favorable to an increased yield.
with-a larger increase in fluids than in
solids. The way to get a herd that
will give a paying yield of rich milk is
to select cows giving rich milk and
then feed for an increased yield. Any
cow not giving milk up to the legal
standard is unfit for the herd. Use
the Babcook test and discard the skim
milk eows.
Here are some rations that have
proved satisfactory in Pennsylvania:
Forty-five pounds ensilage, 7 pdunds
hay. 6 pounds bran, 9 pounds cotton
seed meal. A Mount Pleasant dairy
man feeds this. His herd con
sists of Holsteins and Shorthorns.
yield is 7.000 pounds of milk each per
year, testing 3.08 per cent. of fat. The
ration contains about 2 pounds of pro
tein. 10.6 of carbohydrates and 0.7 fat.
nutritive ratio, 1.6.
A Meadville dairyman with a Jersey
herd makes an average of 870 pounds
butter per year. His ration is: 24
pounds corn fodder, 5.1 pounds bran,
5.1 pounds corn Ineal, 3 pounds cotton
seed meal, 2 pounds oil meal. This
contains more digestible nutrients
tihan the first ration. The nutritive
ratio is 1.7.
A dairyman at 1New Hope reports a
yearly.test of 6 per cent. from a highly
carbonaceous ration. It is: 10 pounds
hay, 5 pounds cornfodder. 6 pounds
corn meal, a pounds wheat bran. The
nutritive ratio is 1:9.8. The yield of
milk was but 8.000 pounds per cow.
Corn meal, oats and bran-equal parts
by weight-will be found an excellent
grain ration. Feed what the cow di
gests well, but not to excess It takes
an expert to make more than twelve
pounds of grain pay unless the price
of milk is high.
The effect of the ration fed by the
New Hope dairyman favors a moderate
yield of rich milk, if the cows give rich
milk. The effect of the other rations
is more favorable to a larger yield, be
cause there is more protein in them.
But protein foods are most expensive.
Many Pennyslvania and other east
ern dairymen buy, cows in the west
that were bred and raised out of doors.
They have strong constitutions. The
now owners feed them all the bran
they can possibly get them to eat and
soon use them up. then buy others. A
horse worked to his utmost will soon
break down. So will a cow. Milk
giving is work. For this reason mod
erate rations are given above. If any
dairyman wants to get the most possi
ble out of his cows,in a year or two
years, he can feed for an immense
yield and take the chances.-E. C. Ben
nett, in Orange Judd Farmer.
VALUABLE FOR COWS.
Some )Dalrynucn Prefer Alstke Clover to
All (ther Varleties.
We are asked to describe alsike
clover and to state if it is valuable for
dairy cows. We give an illustration
of this clover. It grows from one to
two feet high: the leaves are oblong
and toothed: flowers are pinkish.
This clover was first cultivated in
Sweeden. It is a valuable plant for
the bee-keeper, and is first-class fox

cows. and when irrigation: or natural
nmoisture can be relied upon it is a
valuable plant. In the report of one
of our experiment stations it is said
that as a rule it does not reach full de
rel,pment the first year but keeps im
provi-g with age. rall rescue. tim
othy. smooth brome a,-I other strong
g.*rowing grasses are u - .'al'y sown with
this clover in mxeadot-s as its stems
are rather w-eak and it does not stand
up well when alone. In a recent cnt
versatioe with an Illinois dairyman lihe
told u that he preferred it to any
other kind of clover. -Farmer's Voice.
Mtlaking the Io Westal.
Mannulel F. de (osta, who resides si.
mnile$ south of Sacramento. Cal., on the
RiverÂ·ide road, has built an ingenious
machine for irrigating his fiower
:garten and his orange and lemor
Lr-ee. It cnsists of a wooden whee!
ten feet w-ide. A dog is placed insidt
the wh~eel. vhich is turned by his
,-eight. as he gallops in treadmill
fashion. The revolution of the axle
turns a crank which operates the
handle of a pump set in a dug well.
After half an hour's exercise the dog is
taken out and a fresh dog put in for
another half hour. Thie dogs seem to
enj~oy the work. for they bark and wag
their tails when they are brought to
the wheel. They know that it means
something good to eat at the end of
the half hour's work.
