"The Psychology of Crime," by
Henry Wood is a notable feature in
the October Arena, which also con
tains able contributions on religious,
social, political and economic is
si:e.i, The Arena fully maintains its
position as the review which most
clearly voices advanced thought and
progressive ideas.
O. J. Young, deputy sheriff of
Hazelhurst, Miss., was in Lafayette
Wednesday and left on Thursday
morning's train for his home, hav
ing in charge the negro thought to
be Jeff Gibbs, who was captured by
Sheriff Broussard some time since
and was held until the arrival of
the arrival of the Mississippi officer.
Among timely questions ably dis
cussed in the October Arena are "A
Ready Financial Relief," ."Silver or
Fiat Money," and "Irrigation."
The last subject is discussed by Ri
chard J. Hinton, and will be read
with interest by thousands who ap
preciate the growing importance of
this great question.
Mr. Ernest Francez, of Carencro,
and Miss Nydia Guchercau, of this
town, were married in the Catholic
church last Tuesday. Quite a large
number of people assisted at the
ceremony, and many are the good
wishes made that the young couple
may have a long life of unalloyed
happiness.
Joseph Andrews, a gentleman
of African descent, was arrested
by Sheriff Broussard, held under
the charge of horse stealing in St.
Landry. Andrews admits hisguilt,
and further admits that he has been
engaged in this line of business for
some time, and it has proved quite
successful. It is said that several
horses have been recovered through
his confession. He might have
continued his depredations a while
longer, had he kept out of Lafayette
parish. Sheriff Broussard gets
them every time.
Basket Picnic.
Last Sunday, after low mass, the
members of the Magnolia Base Ball
Club, of Carencro, (who are also
members of the string band) and
their friends, assembled at Mr. F.
A. Guilbeau's residence, and then
started for the Couvilion grove, with
music at the head. Reaching the
place a nice spot was selected, and
the party proceeded to enjoy a bas
ket picnic. The day was most
agreably spent, and games of tennis,
croquet, ball, etc., were among the
features that afforded amusement.
The contents of the many baskets
being emptied into a commun fund,
as it were, when spread out on the
snow white cloths, made a most
tempting and elegant feast, which
was thoroughly appreciated. At
sunset the merry party left the pic
nic grounds and wended their way
to Mr. F. A. Guilbeau's residence,
and spent the balance of the even
ing in dancing. The party was
composed of some 7o people, and
all expressed themselves as having
had a most enjoyable time.

The lovers of sport, it goes with

for they'll want to see what the finest
bred two year old colts in south
western Louisiana are capable of
doing. The accommodations at the
track are ample and good so that

Robbed of $175.
Tuesday's Picayune says:
Yesterday W. E.Bowen, of Lafayette,La.,
employed as yardmaster of the Southern Pa
cific road, and delegate of Morgan Lodge
No. 317, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen
to Boston. called on chief Gaster and report
ed that he had been robbed of his pocket
hook containing $175. The man stated that
he reached the city from Lafayette on Mon
day and secured a room at Fabacher's and
that he went out to see the sights.
At about I o'clock in the morning he en
countered a negro, who conducted him to a
house near some square. and while there he
fell asleep, and when he awoke he saw the
negro standing over him. The case was
placed in the hands of detectives Kerwin
and l.ittleton, and these olice's, after inves
tigating the matter, located the house at the
corner of St. Peter and Basin streets and the
negro who had Bowen in charge was William
alias Steve Johnson. * * * Officcr Walsh
arrested Johnson and locked him up on the
charge of grand larceny.
It is due to Judge Bowen to say that he
denies most emphatically being unler the
influence of liquor. His version of the rob
bery, reported in the Times-I)emocrat of the
5th instant, is that "he went out that night
to the Grand Opera HIouse and later retired
to his room at Fabacher's. When he pulled
off his vest to go to bed he found that his
money was missing. He then went direct to
the Central station and acquainted Su perin
tendent Gaster with his loss."
