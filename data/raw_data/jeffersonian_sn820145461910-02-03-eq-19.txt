Brother Stockard’s Editorial
Rev. McClaren, as do most preach
ers, objects to “letting the heathen
rage,” and he even thinks a person
who would voice such a sentiment
“has no thought of humanity,”—a
rather puritanical idea, for thou
sands of good men in this country
who give much to charity at home
draw the line on supporting several
million heathen in the Orient, who,
it seems, will make any profession
or pretension, or join any church or
“mission,” so long as they can loaf
around them and eat free grub, wear
free clothes, get free medicine and
have their every want satisfied. But
if Brother McClaren thinks it is trea
son to “humanity” to “let the hea
then rage,” we will not quarrel with
him. Many people in this country,
however, have lately had their eyes
opened to the extent of this Foreign
Mission craze, or fad, and the riotous
extravagances being practised by
“our missionaries” abroad. Os course
they do some good—a great deal
of good. It does not take Colonel
Denby, or Colonel Seward, or Colo
nel John Barrett, or Colonel Con
ger, or all the ministers’ testi
mony cited by Brother McClaren to
prove that the millions of dollars
sent yearly across the water is not
absolutely wasted. Certainly it helps
civilize, educate and “take care of
the helpless thousands.” The mis
sionaries surely would not misappro
priate the money. But while ignor
ance, misery and distress, nakedness
and hunger stalk abroad throughout
our own land so alarmingly, would
it not be much more patriotic, and
more charitable, to take care of our
own “helpless thousands” first and
help the heathen afterward, than to
shut our eyes to the pitiable need of
our own people while we rush mon
ey, free clothes and free grub to the
Slant Eyes of Asia, —who would turn
upon the hand that feeds them at
the first opportunity? It has scarce
ly been fifty years since we sent our
first missionary to Japan, and we
have poured millions of mission
money into that country since, yet it
was all the “little yellow devils”
could do a year or so ago to keep
from raising a big racket with us and
forcing us to battle. We had to send
a great fleet thousands of feet across
the trackless Pacific, at a cost of
$1,000,000 or more, to let our little
“converted” heathen see the size of
our gun! It is a notorious fact that
99 per cent, of the “converts” made
by our foreign missionaries are the
low-class, lazy, ignorant, wretched
poor, who know nothing of the Bible
and can understand less, until they
hear the pans a-frying in the mission
kitchens.
Brother McClaren quotes Sir
Bartte Frere as saying the teaching
of Christianity among the millions
of Mohammedans in India is effect
ing “extraordinary changes.” About
sir months ago a native Chaldean
came through Carthage soliciting
funds to bring the children of his
four brothers —who had been massa
cred by the Turks, he said, —to this
country to educate them. This man
in conversation >with the editor of
the News, said that all the natives
who were converted by the mission
schools were the illiterate, poor
classes, and that it was impossible
to convert any intelligent, educated
Mohammedan from his religion; that
he had never heard of one being con
verted. We, therefore, believe with
Mr. Watson, that it is the free
clothes, free medicine, free food,
etc., that appeals to these poor peo
ple, more than it is the religion they
are induced to espouse. And relig
ion that has to be bought isn’t worth
much.
We believe in taking care of the
folks at home before seeking charity
jobs among strangers. Cl a side of
the monument erected in Atlanta,
Georgia, to the memory of Ben Hill,
the great Georgia Senator, is a quo
tation from one of his speeches,
which reads something like this:
“He who saves his country, saves
XSfye Jeffersonian
himself and all things saved do bless
him; he who lets his country die,
dies himself and all things dying
curse him.” For our part, we are
for America and Americans first and
forever. One good honest, honora
ble American man or woman is
worth all the Slant-Eyes from New
York to San 'Francisco. Almost
within the shadows of the slums
where Elsie Sigel lost her life were
thousands of poor American men,
women and children in rags, out of
work and without food. Why did
Elsie Sigel pass her own people’s
physical sufferings by, to minister to
a hypocritical heathen gambler and
seducer? Because of false notions
drummed into her head by mis
guided and overzealous missionaries.
Talk about those Chinese rascals be
ing “our own destitute country
men!” Every one of them ought to
be driven into the Atlantic Ocean or
be made to hot-foot it back whence
they came. We have overdone the
immigration business as badly as we
have overdone the Foreign Mission
business. If we must send mission
aries abroad, let us furnish them
enough to live on and keep them
comfortable, and no more. To rush
frantically around with collection
baskets, to buy food and clothing
and medicine, et cetera, for several
hundred millions of heathens, as a
bribe to get them to accept our re
ligion, is not only wilful neglect of
our own people, but it is going
against the laws of God and man.

The Story of a Murder
(Concluded from Page 2)
most overcome by excitement.
Snapmup looked sheepish, but still
foxily triumphant. He laughed un
easily as the bystanders eyed him,
and said;
“Uncle Jimmy, business is busi
ness. Every feller fer himself in
trade, you know.”
“I know you’re a low-down dog
and thief!” old Jackson burst out,
and the quarrel might have become
serious if the auctioneer had not at
that moment begun again in a loud
voice:
“Now, gentlemen, I’m going to be
gin this sale by offering you the lot
that’s marked with the flags. It is
on the corner of Broadway and
Washington streets, and right in the
business center of Boomburgh. It
belongs to Mr. Snapmup, who bought
it from the company. Terms, one
fourth cash; balance one, two and
three years. What am I offered for
this magnificent piece of property—a
business lot 25 by 150 feet!”
The bidding began briskly, and in
ten minutes the lot was sold at three
thousand dollars!
Jackson turned deadly pale as the
whole truth flashed with paralyzing
force upon his brain. He had sold
his one hundred acres for a paltry
fifteen hundred on the very eve of its
rising, temporarily at least, to the
height and dimensions of a great for
tune! His shrewd neighbor would
realize for two acres probably
fifteen times as much as he had ob
tained for the entire tract! Forty
five thousand dollars! And the
chance was gone forever!
The wretched old man rushed wild
ly toward the platform, crying
hoarsely:
“Gen’lemen, you’ve killed me!
You’ve killed me!” and fell dying
upon the grass.
There was considerable excite
ment, and much sympathy expressed,
and a physician went through the
useless form of pronouncing him
dead. But as soon as the corpse had
been borne into the sad farmhouse,
the auctioneer proceeded to cry the
lots. And if any person present real-
ized, no one gave expression to the
truth that Jimmy Jackson was a mur
dered man. A trampled victim of
the godless system which makes a
necessity, and causes men to rend
each other like ravenous beasts in
the deadly conflict for its possession.
Prevent and
Relieve Headache
"It gives me great pleasure to
be able to refer to Dr. Miles'
Anti-Pain Pills as the best rem
edy we have yet had in our
house for the prevention and
cure of headache. My wife who
has been a constant sufferer for
a number of years with above
complaint joins me in the hope
that they may fall into the hands
of all sufferers.”
JOHN BUSH,
Watervleit, Me.
Used Them Four Years.
“Dr. Miles* Anti-Pain Pills
are the best I ever tried for the
relief of headache. I have used
them for nearly four years and
they never fail to give me relief.
I have tried many other rem
edies, but have never found any
better.”
JOSEPH FRANKOWICK,
854 Trombly Av., Detroit, Mich.
There is no remedy that will
more quickly relieve any form
of headache than
Dr. Miles’ Anti-Pain Pills.
The best feature of this re
markable remedy is the fact that
it does not derange the stomach
or leave any disagreeable after
effects.
Druggists everywhere sell them. If
first package fails to benefit, your drug
gist will return your money.
