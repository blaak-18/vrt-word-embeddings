A LOVER’S SERENADE.
One night, a long, long time ago,
While I was sweetly dreaming,
And through my open casement came
The moonlight, softly beaming;
The sound of music, low and sweet,
Upon the night came stealing,
A tuneful, soulful serenade —
And oh, so full of feeling!
A passion plea, a song of love,
With melody abounding,
Accompanied by a sweet guitar,
That kept so softly sounding,
An interlude of sacredness,
It almost set me praying;
And well I knew, no other hand
But Cupid’s, did the playing.
A declaration, sweet in song,
Os love, so deep, abiding;
Then coldness of my truant heart
So softly, kindly chiding;
That tears began to fall, like rain,
Upon my snowy pillow,
And love came rushing, with the
song,
Much like a bounding billow!
The weary years have come and gone,
And death has come, and sorrow;
And he who sang that serenade,
Is eighty-five, tomorrow;
But still his voice is low and sweet,
Its cadence soft, persuading;
And I —his wife for sixty years,
Still love his serenading!

The Lost Pattern
HE morning air swept across
the waters and the golden
sunshine gilded sea and land,
tree and plain. Fresh, sweet
T
flowers grew on every side, and She
bent to touch them as She passed.
“This morn,” She said, “I will
weave my web, my beautiful, per
fect web, with warp and woof so soft
and fine, whose pattern is known to
none but me—ah, to none but me,”
and She laughed softly to herself.
A swallow flew up from the road
side, and with glad, bright eyes She
watched it fly away—away. Then
She gathered the morning flowers
with their hoards of sweetness and
and the dew still on them till her
hands were full, and She murmured:
“Yes, while fresh and strong this
very morn I will begin my web,
known only to me. I will weave it
fine and fair, and the colors will glow,
fadeless and rich. Strong shall it be,
that it may last even after I am
dead.”
Then She waited in the sun and
She sang a blithe, sweet song while
the blue sky bent over her and the
dewdrops dried. Morn had sped ere
She began work, and the glowing
heat of the long June forenoon told
her that the day was passing, fad
ing, dying. But She sang and She
waited in the warm sun. Great, full
blown flowers grew about her. Her
cheeks and lips reflected their per
fect redness and her gentle, happy
eyes were the color of the noonday
sky. As She plucked her radiant
flowers in the sun her heart was full
of joy—joy—joy.
“Ah, life is so rich and full,” She
cried. “Morn is short, though the
days are so long and glorious. This
noon I will weave my web. I will
make it beautiful and strong.”
But some nesting birds were near,
and She paused to hearken to their
happy chatter. Then She came to
Under the Vine and Fig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
a laughing stream, in which She saw
her own fair form, in its beauty and
prime. And while her gorgeous
roses shed their petals in the stream
—the stream that rapidly bore them
beyond her sight—She hummed a
lullaby gentle and crooning, and the
tangled threads of her wonderful web
were forgotten.
Long afternoon shadows fell over
the grass and withered flowers, no
longer bright and sweet, but faded
and dying. The glowing sun sank
farther and farther down toward the
tree-tops, the birds had ceased to
chatter and the noisy stream had
widened to a broad river, swift and
strong. But She watched the har
vesters in a far field, through half
shut eyes, flooded with afternoon
glow. She said slowly and dreamily:
“Ah, life was so busy at noon —
the birds and stream —and now the
haymakers. Till the other things of
the day are done, after the heat and
the sun, when my heart grows
stronger and my hand steady in the
eventide —I will weave my web—my
wonderful, beautiful web, with the
pattern known to none but me. All
the morn, bright and blue, I waited.
All the noon, glorious and warm, I
lingered. All the long dreamy after
noon I smelled bruised flowers and
heard far-off songs—delicious, gra
cious. Now, in the eventide, after
the long day, I will weave my web.”
One by one the hours passed, calm
and full. The breezes died. The
birds were all hushed, and softly,
darkly, fell the dusky night-time,
star-gemmed and dew-spangled.
“Now, while the stars glow I will
begin to weave.”
She laid the faded, withered flow
ers aside, some falling from her hair
and her gown, and with hands that
began to tremble, she reached for
the threads for her web. She turned
to her loom to set them, but those
trembling hands would scarce obey
her will, while afar —afar —there
were voices and faces, strangely fa
miliar —like those known long ago,
seen through a misty veil.
“I am not so strong as I was,” She
said. “And how faded the colors of

NO. 8557—A NATTY LITTLE SUIT.
Nothing is smarter for the little boy
than the pretty little tunic suits, simply
finished by machine stitching or narrow
braid. Such a model is here illustrated
in white serge. A shaped trimming
band outlines the neck and front edges,
and a deep pleat is arranged the full
length of the front and back, extending
out over the shoulders in a very becom
ing manner. The little knickerbockers
are~ shaped by the usual outside and in
side seams, the fulness at the knee be
ing adjusted by an elastic inserted in
the hem. The top is finished by an in
side waist band. The mode is equally
suited to the firmly woven wash fabrics,
such as linen and pique, as well as the
flannels and woolens. For a child of 6
years 2 1/8 yards of 54-inch material will
be required. Sizes, 2-4-6 years.
A pattern of this illustration will be
mailed to any address upon receipt of
10 cents in stamps or silver. Address

my beautiful thread. And the pat
tern known only to me is blurred and
indistinct. I am tired, too, oh, very
tired, and I must rest, and leave this
longer—yet awhile. Tomorrow I
shall surely weave my web. I will
wait till then. Oh,” She sighed, and
looked far away, “this morn—this
noon —and now—night. I will wait.”
And it grew very dark, and She
slept. And when the morrow came
there stood the useless loom and the
tangled, faded threads. The eyes of
the weaver were closed, the hands
were quiet and the singing lips were
silent.
And the wonderful pattern, known
only to her, was lost—lost —lost.
The beautiful pattern was lost.

A MODERN PARABLE.
By Florence Williams Brantley.
He was not responsible for his be
ing; he was a child of accident, con
ceived in sin and brought into the
world under wrong conditions. His
mother hated him before he was
born and deserted him soon there
after. He never knew the love of a
single human being, the influence of
one gentle soul. He became a thief;
he was sent to prison many times and
each time he came away more hard
ened, more bitter towards all man
kind. He went from bad to worse
and finally he killed a man, and in
turn a man, or a set of men, killed
him. The first was murder, the last
—was also murder, but it was legal.
And the lawyers who tried him,
the jury who rendered the verdict,
the judge who passed the sentence
and the sheriff who sent his body
swinging into space were all modern
Christians, so-called followers of the
Christ who repudiated the Mosaic
law of an eye for an eye and a tooth
for a tooth nearly two thousand
years ago—the gentle Nazarene
whose dying words were: “Father,
forgive them; for they know not what
they do.”
Thus it came to pass that in a
Christian country in the year of our
Lord 1900, this poor, ignorant, mis-
guided man was hanged by the neck
until he was dead, dead. And being
a murderer, and not having repent
ed, he was sent to a place called
“Hades ” where, it is said, he will
be punished forever and forever,
world without end. Selah!
ABOUT CLOTHES.
All womankind should heartily fa
vor the inexpensive cotton crepons
which come in all the dainty colors,
and are so marvelously easy to make
up. Requiring virtually no trim
ming, the soft, crinkled stuff lends
itself beautifully to any simple de
sign, and when soiled it is but the
matter of washing out and shaking
before being ready to wear again.
Os course the stuff can not be ironed,
which is a most blessed relief to the
pocketbook that is drawn upon so
heavily for summer laundry. Not
only frocks, but all manner of lin
gerie can appropriately be fashioned
from this material. One exquisite
dress was made for a young girl from
this fabric in peachblow tint, with lit
tle Frenchy touches of black velvet,
and a nightgown was made from an
other piece, in creamy white, with
heavy torchon lace and palest blue
briar stitching at the yoke and
sleeves.
As the summer wanes, the float
ing veil comes on again, just
when it became necessary to buy a
new hat, or freshen the old one a
bit. As a veil must always be free
from the slightest suggestion of
grime, it is well to buy one that will
wash, even at larger first cost. The
way most becoming to the individual
face is preferred, and the softening
effect of a well-adjusted veil is always
desirable. This can be accomplished
without wearing it over the face, a
practice that is often hurtful to the
eyes.
Dutch collars and elbow-sleeves
have won a glorious victory over the
hideous high stocks and long sleeves
of yore. The fashion is sensible and
pretty and the effort to introduce the
long, tight Directoire sleeve failed
with the girl and woman who has a
pretty forearm and a taste for com
fort.
While the wise woman will not
waste much time embroidering gar
ments by hand, the fad for such or
namentation has wrought a pleasing
change from the over-trimmed and
too much peek-a-boo shirt-waist and
corset cover which offended good
taste for so long. The former, in
deed, has been scarcely noticeable,
because where worn it has been made
generally to match the skirt instead
of being so glaringly separate; and
the latter riots no more in excessive
beading and ribbons. One of the
prettiest corset-covers seen was made
of snowy linen, simply button-holed
at the rather high neck and the arm
holes. Over it, the sheer waist had
a depth and whiteness indeed ex
quisite.—A. M. P.
