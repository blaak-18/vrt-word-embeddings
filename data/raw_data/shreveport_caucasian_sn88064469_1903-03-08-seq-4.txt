THE CAUCASIAN.
Official Journal of the
City of Shreveport.
: friend. has fCit at hand for
R:ce P'robm in the South by Samuel
1.)ouih, M1cEne-ry. United States Sen
ator from Louisiana. The subject is dis
cused interestingly and with logical
force, based on facts and conditions, a
knowledge of the inferior race by close
contact and study. Who better than the
white man, who from the earliest in
fancy has come in daily contact with
the negro, first as when children, then
as boys playing together, fishing and
hunting and indulging in all the sports
of youth? Is not such a man a better
and safer critic than the man raised in
the North, where he has acquired more
or less partisan and prejudicial theories
and vagaries of the negro? Senator Mc
Enery has well said of the negro: "He
holds no office in Northern states of
dignity and imporance where his vote
is in certain localities the balance of
power. Why should the South accord
him privileges which are denied to him
in other sections of the Union?"
In his review of the race problem
Senator McEnery has delved into the
historical records of the antiquity and
in every instance the proof is that the
Caucasian has dominated over all the
inferior races. It is as possible to elim
inate these racial distinctions as it is to
remove the' leopard's spots by which
this ferocious animal is distinguished at
a glance from all the wild beasts of the
forest or the jungle. After a careful
perusal of this article we must com
mend Senator McEnery's presentation
of a subject that should impress favor
ably the minds prepared to be influ
enced with reasonable facts and ready
to receive the truth, but the editor of
The Independent: in a caustic editorial
reviews Mr. McEnery's .article, the logic
of ,w.ich he-attempts in vain gto min
inmu rhy a4dressing hgimself to -his
raadersief tdaoe and temper which in
ditaweS that lhe has not outgrown the
prejudiced, the fanatical impressions
left on his mind by Uncle Tom's Cabin
and.- similar sensational stories, sug
gested at a time when the Puritanical
spirit at the North dominated and led
to an internicene war the like of
which is without a parallel in history
and which shocked the civilized worth
with horror. Unfortunately the editor
of The Independent is afflicted with
negroism from- which he can never re
cover, and therefore he is not compe
tent to criticise so serious a subject,
which in its consideration sihold have
enlisted his best thoughts and miost
liberal views. This man, however, is a
fair sample of millions in the North,
prejudiced in mind and body, who in
sist on the social and political equality
)f the African and the Caucasian in the
South but would abhor, revolt at thel
very suggestion of a negro son-in.law,
or of the negro bejng introduced' hand
entertained in the company of his wife
and daughters and their lady friends.
In words indefinite, this man holds to'
ridicule the declaration of Mr. McEn
ery, the truth of which supported by
Divine authority, is "that the amalga-a
tion of. the races is improssibl,," and to
sustain his vagaries as to negro equal
ity and the "paroxysmal impulse now
taking possession of the negro race in
this century," he points to the last half
ce.tury during which, he says, "the
Japanese nation with the Caucasian
take a front rank among the strong and
intellectual nations of the world." It is
true the progress of the Japanese has
been wonderful, but they are of the
_MfngoHaIa race and can, never rise to
the Caucasian, who must dominate, in'
negro will advance and progress (if let
alone by the Puritanical fanatics of the
North) he can never expect to teach a
plane of the superior races first of
which is the Caucasiat, then the Mia~o
gowan and., the other :races in thir
order, but with all his caustic criticism
and tart words, The Independent's ed
itpr could not conceail his .iganorance,
tbhid ~s hawpariouable in one of his ta

Of which The Independent's editor is no
doubt one, are not fit counsellors or ad
visers or guides and should cease their
intermeddling with the negro.
Let the negro alone.
In the South the negro is receiving
all the advantages of public schools;
he is fully protected in all his rights and
property, and the same bar which rules
and fixes the social relations of the
classes of the Caucasian race, governs
the negro in the selection of his asso
ciates in his home. There can be no
social equality and in a political sense
the man qualified under the law, Cau
casian or African, can vote. The safety
of good government has demanded the
restriction of the ballot, under provis
ions fixed by law in each State of the
South, and these limitations of the suf
frage; fixed as they are in Massachu
setts and Pennsylvania, operate to the
disfranchisement of white men because
they can not comply with the legal re
quirements o the law. But, seriously,
it is not possible to reason with any
man, hide-bound with prejudice, these
"holier than thou" men who in a politi
cal sense would rip up a Southern man
in the back with the right hand while
handing him a Bible with the left. The
South should expect no fair treatment
from the canting, sanctimonious hypo
crites at the North. The South's safety
must rest on the preservation at all
hazards of the present relations between
the races, which insures the rule of in
telligence and white supremacy; the
political and the social prominence in
all things which are sacred to and con
cerns the South alone. This is plain.
But here is Mr.. McEnery's views on
the race problem in the oSuth, and
which will be endorsed by all Southern
men:
"The negro is here to stay. He can
not be deported. It would be a cruel
and harsh measure and would be im
practical. The South as' a unit is op
posed to his deportation. He is needed
because .he is a very valuable laborer,
and, treated with impartiality and jus
tice, he will be a potent factoar in the
development. of, the South, in all field
and industrial occupations open to him
and suitable to his mental, moral and
physical training. The question is a
daily one, What to do with the negro?
The answer is let him alone and let him
work out his own destiny on lines fixed
and unchangeable."
"Ten cents .for July cotton." That is'
what the New' Orleans papers say. It
is good news and may, be an indication
of the price the staple will bring next
season--M'ansfield Journal.
How many of the growers and the
broducers will have cotton for sale in
July at io cents? This price '. no indi
cation that cotton will range next sea
son at the present quotations. The pru
dent and practical planter or farmer
will grow all the corn and feedstuff pos
sible, including a few hogs, etc., and'
then plant all the cotton he will be able
to gather during the picking season.
With a full supply of such products as
he can grow and if not grown he must
buy, he will b4 ready to take advantage
of the cotton market.

true tht, nominahlly w'e hatve an inde
pendent party organization, but in real
ity it is not true, as is witnesse- by the
formation of our State Central Com
mittee. Our party organizatiin is built
up and maintained on the theory that
administartion exercise and control of
the State patronage is necessary for its
success.
"Let us review the origin and more
salient features of this plan:
"It had its origin in the reconstruc
tion period and was adopted as a means
of depriving negroes of as many of the
rights and privileges conferred by bal
lot as possible.
"No one will deny that it accom
plished this result.
"Now two important facts will be
noticed in this connection:
"First, there was opposition to the
Democratic, or white men's party, of
this State!
"Secondly, this opposition was of such
a character that it was considered neces
sary to deprive it of all political privi
leges possible-the ballot paritcularly.
"Wnhat are the conditions and results
today?
"The common enemy has been, long
since vanquished, but the iniquitous sys
tem, which can only exist uizfairly in the
interests of one party or faction, at the
expense of another, has built up an op
position within, its own party ranks.
Thus we have the administration and
anti-administration parfy ot this State!
And we are bound to have them as long
as the system remains. It distinctly or
ganizes and maintains with -the unfair
advantage of government patronage,
one faction within the party at the ex
pense of another. No matter ho* wisely
or efficiently the government may -be
administered, an administration and
anti-administration party is the in
evitable result. So that, as a matter of
fact, it maintains factional organization
and breeds discord within the party
ranks.
"But this is not the only anomaly
presented by this method of party or
ganization or machinery. B3y disfran
chising the white voters of the State
with the same methods and laws em
ployed in disfranchising the ignorant
and vicious negroes of the reconstruc
tion period, and other equally undemo:
cratic methods, it controls the true
democratic sentiment 'and majority of
this State.
"This is the most important question
that confronts the people of Louisiana
today. When any element or, issue of
discord exists within the party it should
if possible be removed. True, the ques
tion is much larger than one of. party
merely, but for the sake of party and
party harmony alone it should be
changed. This great State can no longer
afford to claim or maintain a pate.nt
right to dabble in petty politics--to en
fore against its honest, intelligent white
citizens reconstruction extremes and
subterfuges that were designed only to
check deluded negroes and unprincipled
whites.
"Until this patronage is entirely de
stroyed there will be no political free
dom in Louisiana. It is not enough to
ask of gubernatorial candidates how
they stand on this issue. The fight must
begin at home. No man should be elect
ed to either branch of the Legislature
henceforth who is not unequivocally
pledged to work and vote for the aboi
tion of the last vestige of this patron
age."
The Felicianas is right. The fight is
now on and must be pressed forward.
For years the Caucasian, single-handed,
has been urging the return of all power
to the people. The government by the
people and for the people must triumph
over the schemings of the few who have
dominated the Democracy in their self
ish interest--for personal aggrandize
ment. This movement for the reform of
an abuse, to!erated for years on the plea
of a necessity which ng longer exists, is
growing, growing and becoming power
ful because it is as just as it is right.
The duty of every citizen is plain.
In speaking of Teddy Roosevelt's
negro policy, Sam Jones says "most
every man is some kind of a fool, but
