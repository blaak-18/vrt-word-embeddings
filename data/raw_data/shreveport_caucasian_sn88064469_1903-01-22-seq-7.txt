WILL RECIPROCATE.
Wells-Fargo and Pacific Express Compa
nies Give Each Other Preference.
San Francisco, Jan. 16.-The Exam
-iner says the Wells-Fargo Expres:
company has ordered its agents to give
preference to the Pacific Express com
pany over all other express companies
in routing through business. The Pa
cific Express company has issued simr
ilarinstructions to all its agents. This
is in pursuance of a plan recently de
tided upon by E. H. Harriman of New
York. The Southern Pacific is a large
holder of Wells-Fargo stock and Mr.
Harriman is director in the latter and
chairman of its executive committee.
The Union Pacific, Mr. Harriman and
George Gould own Pacific Express
company. While there is no consoli
dation of offices of stock or finances
there is to be a community business.

Austin, Jan. 16.-The house finally
decided to have eleven pages. Mrs.

In the senate Senator Arch Grinnan
of Brown county was sworn in. Fol
lowing general committee clerks
were announced: W. A. Shaw, Jr., Dal

Chaffee of Bexar was appointed sten

CARDINAL DEAD.
Monsignuor Parrochi Was Considered Most
Likely to Succeed the Pope.
Rome, Jan. 16.-Cardinal Lucido
Mary Parocchi. sub-dean of the sacred
college and vice chancellor of the
Roman Catholic church, died of heart
disease.
He was born in 1833 and was of
Italian nationality and created a car
dinal in 1877.
The death of Cardinal Parocchi re
moves one of the prelates considered
to be most likely to succeed Pope
Leo. There was always considerable
friction between the pope and Cardi
nal Parocchi on this account and led
to unprecendted steps of the pontiff in
removing the cardinal from the post of
vicar of Rome, because he thought
that he too openly posed as the future
pope. Nevertheless the pope was deep
ly affected by Cardinal Parocchi's de
mise. He knelt in prayer and exclaim
er: "These frequent deaths have made
me feel quite an old man."

Washington. Jan.. 12. - Among th

hend all the "evidences of civilization'"
as they appear in the art and aruhite"
ture of the ('apital ('ity. their si;glili
cance and mIanling are not wholly lost
upon hiim.
Not long ago there was visiting in
the city one of the old chiefs of the
onc e p iaverful
Six Nations. tie

and wals for the

The thoughts
which the study

"UGH!" HE REMARKED. awakened in his
mind may be Inferred from his terse
and epigrammatic comment.
Loaking first at "'The Landing of the
Pilgrims." the Indian said:
"Ugh! Indian give white man corn."
Next he turned to "William Penn
Making a Treaty With the Indians."
"Ugh!" lie remarked. "Indian give
white man land."
Following this, his glance fell on "Po
cahontas Saving the Life of Captain
John Smith."
"Ugh! Indian save white man's life."
he commented.
Last he gave a keen, brief look at
"Danlel Roone In Conflict With Indi
ans."
"Ugh!" he said dryly. "White man
kill Indian."
A somewhat unusual incident has oc
curred in the pension bureau which
g quite took,. the breati
S n away from COtpmis
e Man Who loner Ware and bhi
SRefaed a clerks.
Pension it sedms that some
time age John A. Daley
of Topeka. Kan., who is a veteran of
the Fourteenth Indiana. filed a petition
for a pension. Investigation Justified
his claim, the bill was passed, and he
was informed that his name was on
the government roie!for $12 a month.
Imagination fails to picture ,the aston
Ishment at the pension bureau when
Daley replied with a letter declining
the pension.
Conlnoed that he had to deal with
a crazy muan, Commissioner Ware sent
a man to Topeka to investigate the sit,
nation. The clerk found there an 'il
man, bent double from, disease tr
tracted in the army, suffaering. frg
many bodily allments. but still keepi)
a keen and vigorous intellect.
"Some of my kind neighbors ques
tioned my army record." the old man
told the clerk. "But now my record has
been cleared. I am 'satisfied. The gov
ernment is paying too many millions
for pensions now."
Fabulous as it may seem, the story is
vonched for by Commissioner Ware,
though the attaches of the pension 'bu
reau are somewhat cynical and, are
keeping Daley's money Tor hini. await
ing a change of mind.
While Dr. Wiley of the agricultural
department is feeding his victims on

Colonel Charley. Ed

Edwards the -Democratic con
I t R gresulonal committee
of the late eampaign,
is getting his digestive apparatus in
trim for eating a hat. During, the cam
paign Senator Elkins and Colonel Ed

elections. The colonel offered to eat
the senator's hat if the Democrats did
not carry one or more congressIonal
diltri. t I n West Virginia. The Dem
oerats did not carry nay of the dis
trieta. and Elkins insists that the
sagreement must be carried out. Earnest
people who have -learned about the
matter- are making suggestions, and
those who want to advertise digestive
medicines are iffertng their wares.
Fro-n Cincinnati Senator Elkins re
eCaed a letter which says:
Hako Stephen B. Elkins:

A New York man who is recognized
as something of a sartorial authority
was in W\ashington the other day and
observed an incident which caused him
to riiarl'k:
"Who dictates the style of dress for
this :ul linistration?"
"Why,'" a bystander :si kd.
"It would he interesting to know, for

"What!" blankly remarked I)r. Hill.
"The press and the department with.

"'Cap.' said the nmute. 'we shall have

Several congressmen were sitting in
the room of the committee on military
affairs the other day discussing the
possibilities of war when General Hull
of Iowa remarked:
"I see that Adjutant General Corbin
has recommended that the younger of
ficers of the army should not marry."
"Humph!" remarked a grizzled mem
ber of the committee on the other side
of the table. "Then they will never
know what real war is."

What has been knofwn all these years
as Lyons velvet, or velvet with a pure
silk back, has taken on for cloak and
gown wear a new departure. This new
gown velvet has been called chiffon
velvet, and the heavier quality of the
same is used for the making of richest
cloaks of all lengths and is also madetl
up into gowns, when they are to be

wide border -of embroidery in colored
silks, whieb-may be Persian, Chinese
or Turkish, as oriental coloring la alto
gether to the fore for this kind of deco
ration. The lightness of cloaks made
of this new velvet is a pleasing cqp
trast to the velvet garments in the past.
This chiffon velvet'in evening colors is
of surpassing beauty and lightness and
the craze of thie hour.
Motor driving has made a hit in all
fur suits. Modish and brought into
fashion also is the use of dressed pony
and donkey skins for long coats, their
trimming of moleskin or natural beaver
as well as otter. Felt. beaver.and glazed
kid are the proper hats to wear with
them. and soft silk drawn in curtains
is attached and, as well mica masks,
thought indispensable for long jour
neys.
The extravagance of past years in
fine handkerchiefs has been fully re
vived. Real laces are employed in great
beauty and manufactured for that ex
press purpose. The lace worker's skill
turns the narrower lrces into designs
of great attractiveness, while the gm
brolderer's art stands out in marvel
qgt wars with and without combina
tions of lace. Less elaborate, but of
great beauty, are the narrow needle
work bordered handkerchiefs, as well
as costly machine wrought, which has
reached a perfection that is admirable.
Fine colored cambric lawns are modish
to a certain extent with forenoon suits.
but need to be carried judiciously.
For street suits and general wear
nothing is more popular than heavy
rough mixed cloths. They have become
prime favorites rather than the same
rough cloths in solid colors. Suitings if
flecked with white, black and mixed
colors make up very becomingly.
