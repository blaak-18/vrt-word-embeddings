The Grant Parish Case.
Woods Has a Little Say.
The Motion for a New Trial Overruled,
From the-New Orleans Bulletin.
Wood» had hi« say this morning
on the motion for a new trial in the
Grant Parish case.
lie tame into.court at about 9:30
o'clock, ascended the bench,- and
.proceeded to speak.
• IIE STARTED
out by tolling what he was going
to pass upon, (as if everybody xlid
not know) and then took up the
several grounds in tjie motion.
lie bunched"the first seven ; -he
said they may be.taken together, as
they are âll to the effect that "the
verdict ® as not In accordance with
the law.
He had bpen an attentive listen
er, he mildly informed everybody—
of the testimony. He had listened
through two trials and he could see
noVl Tffercnce between the evidence
in the one and the evidence in the
other. Tie related what he consid
ered the facts, as established by
this evidenca It was
A NICE STORY,
in which were detailed the terrible
doings of the white men, and the
meekness of spirit, and the fear of
the black Si
In speaking Of the surrender lie
said that the negreos had capitula
ted, and when after this tTrey threw
down their arms a volly was poured
into them by the white men, which
not o<8>» r wounded a nimber of tlie
negroes but brought do.wn
TWO OF TIIE WHITE MEN, 0
(Hadnot and ILiyis) who'were try
ing to prevent bloodshed, [Jupiter
Pluvius.] He said that Nash had
acted without any warrant or au
thority, and that after, he had con
quered Ward never demanded the
Court House, (reason why, it was
burned dqjvn), but that lie had with
Cazabat, made a pretense of hold
ing court. lie said that notwith
standing the threats of the negroes,
no white man had Jbecn injured [the
outrage on Rutland's house to the
contrary notwithstanding].
The evidenee showed that Irwin
and Cruikshank were, with the
banded men, and all in all he
thought there was strong evidence
in^support of # the counts as to ex
tent, and the seven grounds were
not well founded.- 6 '
THE EIGHTH GROUND,
which relates to the convict Kelly.
lie did not consider the simple fact !
that Kelly was a convict, a gUkid |
ground for setting aside the ver
'0
opinion expressed by him as to!
n hal the évidence had established,
embodied only such facts as had !
been admitted to be true, bat that ;
afterwards that .he, by" request ofj
counsel, charged that the defence,
admitted nothing, and that they !
must not be ^overiieil by what hojbe
hid pr^id.
diet. He overruled it".
THE NINTH GROUND,
was overruled,-because thereüwas —
in the learned Judge's opinion—no
„d-oubt that the Mulvey who served
on the jury was the Mul vey wanted
by the commissioners. [No one
doubts it.J *
ON THE TJBNTH GROUND,
after citing a number of authori
ties, he wisely.decided J,hat neither
the law of England nor" the'com
mon law of England hor the com
mon law of tne * nited States gives
the jury the right to pass upon tlie
law, and that, therefore when he so
so instructed thejuryin this case,
he was right. He overruled it.
THE ELEVENTH.GROUND
lie disposed of by saying that the
THE TWELFTH GROUND
could not stand, because the law
did not require the_\erdict to be
written. It migbt be the rule or.the
State courts; but the United States
courts need uOt be governed by
that. (It lays with the Judge.]
The thirteenth ground he rapped
on the head by. sayiug that the
statements were'not true in point
of fact, aud that under tlie true
state of the case it -could not stand.
It related to the. second • charge of
his Honor, delivered, after the re
ceipt of a message not received iu
open court.
He thought the separation of the
jury, as set toiuth.in the fourteenth
ground, was all right so long as the
men fi ho went out Were in charge
of the seven bailifls.
The. fifteenth, sixteenth, seven
teenth: and eighteenth counts he
disposed of by sayiug that his
charge to the jury was strictly ac
cording to the law ami the'evidence
he overthrew.
He wound up by saying that the
prisoners had bad a^fyJJ. and fair
trial, which had been couducted
with'great hberalityou the part of
the prosfcetuting ofliutr. - [Good
enough.] And then sorrowfully—
or s<? sorrowfully, overruled, the
motion.
Grant Parish Prisoners.
Another Turn in the Tide -!
Justice Bradley Orders an Arrest of
Judgment and Releases the Priso
•' ners on Bail-! 4
From the New Orleans Picayune.
Judge Bradfey retuîned To the
city yesterday. At 12 o'elock lie
took his seat on the bench with
Judge Woods and announced thât
he had prepared-a decision upon
the points raised Jby Mr. M a it , in
arrest of judgment and testing the
constitutionality of the -Kn-Klux
act. " •
justice Bradley then read Iiis de
cision, a most lengthy,* exhaustive
and »intelligent one. • . •
Under the indictment, the priso
ners were charged ;witb : : L Con
spiracy to take away certain rights
from eitizens of African descent. 2.
The commission of murder whilst
engaged in this conspiracy ; ami
found guilty of sixteen counts.
That Congress hjS' tlie right to
pass laws to carry out the provis
ions of the „thirteenth, fourteenth
and fifteenth amendments, no one
will deny. The qnestioji'jw, how
*' 11 ' thj&ïight extends. •
Tlio thirteenth amendment; de
clares that all persons in the . Uni
ted States shall not be disqualified
from voting on-account of. race,
color or previous condition." The
United States is givêu no power to
pass laws relative to elections or
voting, but simply to see that the
States do not interfere with these
rights. The United States has on
ly the power to see these rights en r
torced. The moment the-State tails
to comply with the/duties, enforced
upon it, the United States is called
on to interfere; ami the interfer
ence of Congress. when the State is
ready to punish violations of these
rights, is unnecessary! injudicious
aqjl illegal.
To constitute an offense ot which
the United States has jurisdiction,
1t must be shown that a conspiracy
was formed to take away certain
rights from- a person on accoonrtt
of his race, color or previous condi
tion.
The fifteenth amendment declared
tliat the right of every «itrzei) of
the United" StafeSThJ vote shall -not
deirietl by tlie United States-or
aiiv Sitate on account of hi* race.
r* f . i f*; i
color or previous eondition. When
• V, . -, irpi .. 9 é ■ . * - •
a State refuses this right, Congress
has power to pass Jaws to tyiforce
the amendment. Congress h «iffy 1
so the power to secure these fights
against violeuce and outrage on the
part ot individuals; therefore, T am
unwilling to ^affirm the unconstitu
tionality of tii is act»
But, le.t us examine the counts of
this indictment:.
The first count -charges the prison
e/s with conspiring. to prevent Cer
tain perüoug-of African descent Iroœ
peaceably assembling. The. consti
tution of the United States declares
that Congress shall -not interfere
with the right of . peaceable assem
blages. *. Does this &moun.t -to
,an affirmative law, giving the United
States the jurisdiction over all per?
sons ^irho shall interfere with thf
right of - peafiéable* aseemblage?
Clearly not. • - -
The second count is.the sntüe as
first. ; . ■ *
Th® third cormt declares .that a
Conspiracy ^ns formed to take the
live® of certnin-oitizens Of African de
cent, and withoutdue process of law.
All.murderers do.this . Has the Uni
ted States jurisdiction of all murders?
The fourth count is too vague and
general; so are the 'fifth and eighth.
Their-vagweness is- s'nch thai 'thiiy
cahnot stand. * * i **'
The sixth -and seventh counts
charge the prisoners With.conspiring
against certain persons because they
had voted, or xiërè going to vota
Not a w(?rd is snid that this was done
because of race, color or„ previous
condition. -T^is i'd vital'y necessary."
The mere interference with the sight
of voting is no offense nflder. thejn.
risdiétion of the United States. ' •
The following eight counts are j fi
erai copies of the. first eight, - and
must fall with therm
I nm accordingly - ot the opinion
that the indictment is fatally defec-"
tive.
Judge Woods than iu a few words
announced that'he differed in ôpii®
ion with Justice Bradïey, and that
they had resolved to certify to a dlf
ference of opinion so that the Su
preme Court of the United States
cpuld" pass upon the-question'.
As, however, th& Superior Judge
had decided against the validity cf
the indictment., it could not stand—
for the present, and the prisoners
were therefore entitled tr> bail. -
Bail in the sum of $5000 for each
prisoner was finished, and Ifndnot,
Cruikshank and Irrçin set. at liberty,
and surrounded and congratulated
by their friends. ®
