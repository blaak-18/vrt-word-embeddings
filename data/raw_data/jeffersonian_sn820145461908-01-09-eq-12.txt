ment of the notes of the national bank.
The Government, of bourse, stands for all
the .people. Consequently, the curious
situation is brought about in which the
people furnish the credit which makes the
national bank note good, and they furnish
it free of charge, and they pay a high
price to get the use of it. A more one
sided, unjust system of currency it would
be hard to conceive.
The national banker not only puts his
money where it does not have to pay any
tax, national, city, county or municipal,
but he puts it where it is at no risk what
ever from fire or flood, chance or change.
He draws interest upon it, which is paid
in advance. He gets the privilege of the
free use of the tax money which belongs
to his less favored fellow-citizens. He
gets in paper currency an amount equiv
alent to the sum he has invested in his
bonds, and he draws compound interest
from his fellow-citizens upon this money
at the same time that he draws interest
on the same sum represented by the bond.
Thus, he is drawing interest twice on the
same money, and his less favored fellow
citizens are paying interest twice on the
same sum of money.
(Note —By a late act, a national bank
can now be started on a capital of $25,-
000.)

A Glance at the Past.
Sir Harry Vane!
Who remembers the name? Not one in
a million; yet he was the first English
Statesman who ever distinctly proclaimed
the doctrine of Liberty of Conscience;
just as he was the first Statesman who
contended that the people should be pro
tected from government encroachment by
a written Constitution.
This was more than three hundred
years ago.
We today enjoy the fruits of his
thought, his labor, and his sacrifice.
For preaching the doctrine that the peo
ple were the real rulers, and the govern
ment a mere servant of the people, vested
with certain limited powers, Sir Harry
Vane was tried for treason, and, in defi
ance of law, was condemned to death.
Here is the sentence which a venal
court passed upon him:
“That he should be hanged, cut down
while living, his body cut open, and his
bowels burned before his face; that his
head should be severed from his body
and his body cut into four quarters.”
Out of his tender mercy, his Gracious
Majesty, King Charles the Second, re
mitted all the sentence except the part
which required Vane’s head to be cut off.
Yes, you carelessly enjoy and carelessly
lose precious rights of self-government
which cost your ancestors their lives tn
win.
THE JEFFERSONIAN.
They went gladly to prison, to the tor
ture chamber, and to the headsman’s
block, rather than surrender the principle
that the Will of the People should be the
supreme law of the land.
We, puny and degenerate descendants
of the heroes of freedom, calmly look on
while a few masters in the great money
centres dictate our laws and violate our
written Constitution; and we fold our
feeble hands in abject discouragement be
cause our very first efforts to regain con
trol of the Government are not crowned
with success!
Miserable cowards that we are —we de
serve that our bosses should despise us,
just as they do despise us.
They cut off the head of Vane because
he said that God, Law and Parliament
were superior to the King.
They cut off the head of Sydney be
cause he wrote that the governed should
have a voice in the government.
But they couldn’t cut off the head
truths these brave men uttered, and the
Creed lived though the Apostle was dead.
All honor to the heroes who with their
sufferings and their blood won us our lib
erties.
All shame to us if we basely go back
to the serfdom we left.

Editorial Notes.
• By J. D. WATSON.
Wall street has evolved another plan
to force the western bankers into further
submission. Their game is to force the
commission houses to refuse checks
drawn on western banks and they think
that will force western bankers to send
more money to New York. When that
money is sent to New York and drafts
are drawn against it, it will be paid in
clearing house checks, which are from 1
to 5 per cent discount. Will the western
bankers submit to this further tyranny?
—T. H. Tibbles, in The Investigator.
Until the present banking system is
changed, the Western banks, like the
Southern banks, may have to submit to
such tyranny. The only way to put an
end to it is to put an end to the system
that permits it.

Thomas W. Lawson, of “Frenzied Fi
nance” fame, promises to run a presiden
tial ticket of his own in 1908.
Roosevelt for President, and Johnson
for Vice President is the way Mr. Law
son has it planned. As Mr. Roosevelt has
announced that he will not be a candidate,
and Mr. Johnson is a Democrat, Mr. Law
son’s ticket is not apt to materialize.

After careful consideration, the Jeffer
sonian lias located the biggest fool, the
veriest ass, that ever lived.
It is that New York preacher who re
fused to take the new twenty-ddllar gold
piece. because Teddy had dropped off
those silly and irreverent and out-of-plare
words “In God we trust.”
To our beautiful fellow citizen, Harvie
Jordan:
Now, Harvie, when will it be time to
have grower and spinner hug one another,
again ?
You dear man!

As Brother Tibbles reminds us, in his
Investigator, the British have had to low
er their prices on steel products, to meet
American competition in the English mar
ket.
Lovely, Tariff.
It protects us from the pauper labor of
England, you see.
The Steel Trust, by reason of its mo
nopoly of the American market, can
charge us such tremendous profits that it
can carry its surplus across the ocean,
dump it in England, and thus give Eng
lish consumers cheaper goods than they
can get from their “pauper labor.”
Beautiful situation, isn’t it?

The Jeffersonian is deeply gratified by
the active cooperation which so many of
our friends are giving us. We now receive,
each day, about as many subs as we re
ceived during the whole week, a year ago.
Both Jeffersonians are here to stay,
friends, and they mean to do good work
for sound principles, many and many a
year to come. In fact, there is no reason
why they should not stand, useful and
flourishing, generations after their found
er is dust.
They are built on the rocks; their prin
ciples are eternally true; and they should
be here, stronger than ever, a hundred
years from now.

INDIRECT TAXATION.
The comptroller of the state of New York
promises to show in his annual report that
the state has experienced one of the most
promising years in its existence. His claims
are based largely on the fact that the receipts
from indirect taxation have broken all rec
ords. The claim suggests a fallacy common
in official and popular circles, that revenue se
cured by indirect taxation is net gain to the
state and no increase of burden upon the peo
ple of the commonwealth. Ordinarily, legis
latures think they have solved a financial
problem when they discover some new means
