That Nlinerlty aport.
The principles laid down in the
miarity repoer of the Committee on
State Debt, of the Convention, are
about as equally subversive of law
and liberty, as the majority report is
of fair dealing and justice. It in
sought by this remarkable doeument
to convey the doctrine, and prove it,
that sovereils States are ad greater
in autonomy than earporated bodies
of law; that they are sabject to the
same statutes, patin and penalties;
ia faet ate mere ereatures of law.
With this do trine, destraetive
alike of the prineiplee of the sover'.
eilgty of States, and through that of
individual liberty in these United
States, we take distinctive and em.
phatic ihue.
That doctrine has had its advocate.
all along during the discussioa of the
questions growing out of the advoca.
cy, and call of this Constitutional
Convention. Their arguments have
been sueecesfully met in these col.
umns, and in thei New Orleans Desmo
eral; it would be mere tautology to
repeat those answers, and our read.
ero are aneiently well acquairted
with them at any rate.
We had hoped that the dissenting
report, however, would have oan.
tained some woe plan for the settle..
aient of the vexed debt question.
We are paeied to say we have not,
from a careful study of it, been able
to glka a shadow for that hope. The
question then, must be left for set
tlement to the Conservative men of
the Convention who will doubtless
propobs, befoetre the diseausslo ea these
reports is had, some equitable plah
upon whicb all having the weldfre of
the people and of the State at heart
ee join. If not, we do not hesitate
to say that the destrucetion of State
credit Is an evil of ees magnitude, is
et a far rehinbig in efect as the
aubversio of the 8tates to the rule
of Federal Courts.
