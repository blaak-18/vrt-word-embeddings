MORPHINE
Causes the Death of Mr.
Dallas McDaniel of
this Town.
The Unfortunate Young
Man Swallows Thirty
Grains of the
Poison.
Mr. Dallas McDaniel died Thus
day morning at 12:40 from the
effects of an overdose of morphine
taken at about 10 o'clock p. m.
It appears that Mr. McDaniel was
at Crouchet's saloon with a number
of rien s when he swallowed the
deadlS$, poison which caused his
death. As he was in the habit of
taking morphine, which was gener
ally known among his acquain
tances, nothing was thought of the
matter until he walked out of the
saloon and showed much weakness.
He was assisted by his friends to
his room-.-at. the Nicholls' house
where he received medical attention
at the hands of Drs. Tolson, Mar
tin and ,Gard; but despite the
efforts of the physicians the unfor
tunate young man expired two
hours and forty minutes after the
fatal it-*tf ttered his stomach.
After swallowing the morphine
Mr. McDaniel said to a companion:
"I think I[have taken too much,
but don't send for a doctor and
doti't let any one use a stomach
pump on me."
The physician were not called
until s t o'clock and it was then too
late to save his life.
Judging from the size of the vial
which contained the morphine and
the' quntity that was left in it, he
swallowed about thirty grains.
1p " fgDpniel's remains were
interred in the Catholic cemetery
Thursday evening. A large num
ber of relatives and friends attended
the funeral.
The Grandest Remedy.
Mr. R. B. Greeve, merchant, of
Chiiqmie., rea., certifies that he
had co nptiun, was given up to
die, sought all medical treatment
that money could procure, tried all
cough remedies he could hear of,
but got no relief; spent many nights
sitting up in a chair; was induced
to try Dr. King's New Discovery,
and was cured by use of two bot
ties. For past three years has been
attending to business, and says Dr.
King's New Discovery is the grand
est remedy, ever made, as it has
done so  uch for him and also for
others in his community. Dr.
King's New Discovery is guaranteed
for coughs, colds and consumption.
It don't fail. Trial bottles free at
WVm. Clegg's drug store.
The Donaldsonville Chief, the
ablest Republican journal in Louis
iana, says:
Sheriff Isaac Broussard, of Lafa
yette parish, has been completely
exonerated by the grand jury from
the accusations of financial shortage
and irregularity in his tax accounts
recently given currency by a New
Orleans paper. Mr. Brousard has
show, li ip eWifone of the most ac
tive ahd flicient sheriffs in Louisi
ana and his vindication is gratifying
not only to his personal friends and
parishioners, but to all citizens who
appreciate ability, faithfulness and
zeal in a public officer.

Last Tuesday'a large number of

TOWN POLITICS.
The Cry Against Rings and Bosses
Will Deceive no One.
Now that it s all over with the Blanc
brothers let us talk politics. The
public mind has been so occupied
with the hanging of the young
murderers that for the past two
weeks the question of municipal
government has been in what the
ex-president would designate -"in
nocuous desuetude." But since the
unfortunate young foreigners have
been swung into the undiscovered
country, and the interest in the
case has died out, the folk of the
town are once more discussing the
municipal situation, but if the di
rection of a few straws recently
caught floating in the political air is
to be taken into account, there is
no "-situation" at all. It's a cock
sure thing for the Democrats.
When the intelligent people put
their thinking caps on it is sate to
say that they will not act unwisely.
And in this case they had just to
think a little bit, look back a short
while and only one conclusion
could be reached. It is not neces
sary to go into details to show the
incompetency of certain gentlemen
to govern the town. They were
tried before and found wanting and
as the proof bf the pudding is in the
tasting of it, the people of Lafayette
are not likely to order the same
dish to be prepared by the same
cooks and served by the same
waiters. A change of diet was a
necessity two years ago and the
health of the municipal body poli
tic demands a continuance of good,
wholesome treatment.
The cry against ring rule, coming,
as it did, from the very fountain of
ringism and bossism deceived no
one. It was one of those thinly
disguished bluffs generally at
tempted by defeated politicians who
would welcome a return to power.
Those esteemed gentlemen talking
against cliques was like Bob Inger
soll eulogizing the Pope, Charles
A. Dana praising Cleveland or the
St. Martin Messenger compliment
ing Gov. Foster. For years those
gentlemen were engaged chiefly in
the manufacture of cliques and
bosses and at this late day their ter
rible enmity to ringism and bossism
is suspiciously sudden and clearly
insincere.
The town election has resolved
itself into one thing. It is: "'Will
we have a good, strong intelligent
Council? or will we not ?"
On the 3d of May the voters of
the town will answer this question
and judging from appearances they
will answer it in no unmistakable
terms.

A GREAT
TRAVELER.
Charles -Everetts, 14 Years
of Age and a Native'of
!Tampa, Fla.,
Has Visited Every State
and Territory Without
Paying a Cent to
Railroads.
Charlie Everetts is a bright, blue
eyed boy. He speaks English well,
and having traveled extensively, is
quite an entertaining little fellow.
He is a native of Tampa, Fla., but
has not visited that place since the
day he boarded a freight train with
the determination to see as much of
the world as he could. Charlie is
only z4 years of age and has been
traveling four years. During that
time he has visited eery State and
Territory in the Union, with the
exception of Washington. And
strange to say he never found it
necessary to buy a railroad ticket.
Being asked how much money he
had contributed to the wealth of
railroad corporations, he replied
with a smile: "'Not a cent. They
have enough glue without getting
mine."
Charley Everetts is by choice a
jockey and when in luck he makes
lots of money, but he is inclined to
be a sport and spends his earnings
with unstinted liberality. He rode
horses in Portland, Brooklyn, Phil
adelphia, Boston, Des Moines, New
Orleans, and in all the large cities
in the United States. When he gets
tied of riding horses he rides freight
trains.
About a year ago he secured a
menial position on a steamship and
visited England, returning to
Boston, and then went around
to Galveston and finally landed in
Verra Cruz.
About six months ago Everetts
was in Lafayette where he enjoyed
the hospitality of his friend, Mr.
Paul Demanade, of whom he thinks
a gret deal. After leaving here he
went West visiting a number of
States and spending a couple of
months in California. The famous
prize fight was a great attraction to
him and nothing could have kept him
away from Carson City. He was
a Corbett man and the defeat of the
Californian was sorely disappoint
ing to him. While out West he had
occasion to see Bryan and heard
him speak. He has never lost an
opportunity to see a celebrated
character, having seen three presi
dents-Harrison, Cleveland and
McKinley.
Being questioned about his rela
tives, he said that his father and
mother were both dead, but he had
some relatives living in Florida,
but he did not know when he would
ever see them again.
He is an inveterate cigarette
smoker; but expressed his intention
of quitting the use of tobacco as it
was proving injurious to his system.
It is doubtful if there is to be
found anywhere in the country a
boy of x4 years with such a record.
Although having never attended
school, he reads English and is well
informed on general topics.
Dyes of all kinds for coloring
Easter eggs. 5 cents a package at
Moss Pharmacy.
Play Ball.
A number of gentlemen interested
in the organization of a base ball
club will meet at Oak Avenue Park
Sunday afternoon at 5 o'clock. A
practice game will be played after
which a club will be organized. An
invitation is extended to all to be
present. Admission free.
Now that Lafayette has a crack
tactician why not have a military
organization? The boys in and
around town could muster a fine
company.

A CAR-LOAD
Of Corn to be Shipped to the
Drouth Sufferers by the
Farnsers Near Brous
sard.
The Farmers' Alliance met at
Broussard last Saturday and inaugu
rated a movement which will result
in the shipment of a car-load of
corn to the drouth sufferers in
North Louisiana. Messrs. Adolph
Girouard, Jules Langlinais and Au
relien Olivier were appointed on a
committee to solict donations from
the farmers of the neighborhood
and ship them to the drouth
smitten section. The Gazette has
been informed that about a car-load
of corn has been obtained and in
a few days it will be shipped to
Capt. J. L. Bonds, at Ruston, for
distribution.
Something to Know.
It may be worth something to
know that the very best medicine
for restoring the tired out nervous
system to a healthy vigor is Electric
Bitters. This medicine is purely
vegetable, acts by giving tone to
the nerve centers in the stomach,
gently stimulates the liver and kid
neys, and aids these organs in
throwing off impurities in the blood.
Electric Bitters improves the appe
tite, aids digestion, and is pro
nounced by those who have tried it
as the very best blood purifier and
nerve tonic. Try it. Sold for Soc
or $r.oo per bottle at Wm. Clegg's
drug store.
The last donation to the High
School library was made by Mr.
John S. Rand. It is a volume on
",Travels in Mexico."
Rev. Dr. Morton began a series
of meetings in the Presbyterian
church Thursday and will continue
for one week. Dr. Morton is an
eloquent divine, and all are cor
dially invited to attend.
Mr. Frank Lenormand and sis
ter, Miss Vidia, of Patterson, were
here this week the guests of Mrs.
Alfred Chargois.
About the Roads.
To the Lafayette Gazette.
A few lines about the unpardon
able condition of the roads in the
third ward will no doubt meet with
the approval of the traveling public.
Last Friday people coming from
several parishes could be easily
singled out. Persons with their
faces and clothing besmeared with
mud could be seen on every road.
Broken vehicles in the various bog
holes near town showed how bad
the roads are.
Will there ever be a time when
road-overseers will perform their
full duty? One has only to leave
Lafayette and travel over the Caren
cro road one or two miles to be
convinced that not even an attempt
was made to repair the worst and
most dangerous bog-holes, the like
of which can hardly be found in
the lowest swamps of the State.
It is conceded that money is
scarce, very scare, this time of the
year and that Lafayette abounds in
fine goods to be sold at low prices.
It is also equally well-known that
Lafayette has a number of first
class, up-to-date stores. But
should any one living in the first,
fourth or sixth ward desire to come
to town to make his purchases he is
confronted with the impassable con
dition of the roads. He knows that
unless the good people owning pro
perty along the road allows him to
pass in their fields he can not come
to town, and in this way the mer
chants of Lafayette lose a consi
derable amount of trade to which
they are entitled.
Let our police jurols do some
thing to repair the roads, and parti
cularly the third ward police juror,
who is no doubt not fully aware of
the condition of things.

"*What Can We Do?"
The following is found floating in
the provincial press lately:
"Editing a, paper is a nice bus;
ness. If we publish a joke people
say we are rattlebrained. If we
publish original matter, they say
don't give 'em selections. If we
give 'em selections, we were too
lazy to write. If we give a man a
puff, we are too partial. If we
don't compliment the ladies, we are
publishing a paper not fit to make a
bustle out of. If we remain in our
office, we are too proud to mingle
with the common herd.
"If we are on the streets, we are
not attending to business. If we
run with poor folks, people say we
are running in jim-crow society.
If we run with rich folks, people say
we are stuck up. If we wear poor
clothes business is dull. If we
wear good clothes, we never paid
for them. Now, what must we do?
Some say we stole this from an ex
change-and we did, and that ex
change stole it front another, and
so on ad infinitum."
Promoting Immnigration.
The Louisiana Immigration Asso
ciation is a chartered institution
formed for the purpose of securing
desirable immigrants to this State.
The association will keep a book
in which lists of lands with their
description and price will be en
tered for the inspection of such
persons as may visit our State with
the view of purchasing lands for
homes. The office at Shreveport is
in a suitable portion of the city,
close to all hotels and depots.
The association will also answer
all questions by intending home
seekers who may correspond with
its officers. It will also advertise
Louisiana abroad, especially in the
States of the northwest. The asso
ciation is an organized effort to set
forch the advantages of Louisiana
as a home and to bring together the
land-seeker and land-seller. It re
lies on the patriotic, public-spirited
citizens and land-owners to take
stock which is $5.oo per share.
Its charter provides that it shall
pay no dividends, hence all stock
holders understand that they are
uniting int a collective capacity to
develop the State. The present is
the most suitable time for this
work as the completion of a
great trunk line railway to Shreve
port from the great gra;n producing
centre, whose commercial emporium
is Kansas City, brings Louisiana in
close touch with Nebraska, Kansas
and the great Northwest. The as
sociation earnestly requests land
owners, particularly those having
large bodies, to send on their lists
with postage for correspondence.
There will be no fee for entering the
lists of lands or correspondence
relative thereto.
