ie took great pride
As a citizen ir. eetitall was alway
in line of (eites. Ie was always aming
the foremost in responding to every
call. During tihe ra of reconstruction,
whetn Louisiana's fonue was datrkcned
by the infamies of political aliens. he
was it the front aiding in the resistance
of the hordes who threatened to engulf
civilizatingii into 4rredeemable ruin and
disaster. "These were trying days whit
°men with stout heart', arrested the tid^
of ignorance and vettality and upheld
the rule of intelligence and white sit
premacy. ¶
As a soldier D)r. Kenidall won di -
tiction for hi courage, which was
noted in a personal mention of the gen
eral commanding for gallantry on the
field. lIe left Shreveport when the
South called her sons to rally to her
defense. in the Shreveport Rangers' a
company of the Third Louisiana, on
whose battle flag were inscribed gh
rious victories, and on his return home
he resumed the peaceful pursuits of the
good citizen.
As a friend and a companion I)r.
Kendall was noted for his loyalty and
his sincerity. He was always gentle;
no man could be more patient: he was
liberal and kind: he would rather suf
fer an injury than to inflict one. He
never complained and in all the vicissi
tudes of life he was cheerful and hope
ful. He would share readily his last cent
with any one in need, and no man or
woman or child ever appealed to him in
vain. He was no double-dealer: lie was
honest and while lie was as sympathetic
as a woman, yet. in any emergency he
was cool. fearless and determined. He
could not be made to quail, and he
wo"td have faced hell itself to maintain
hi, ior or his integrity, which, after
all. as the most' valuable asset a man
can leave as an heritage to the world.
But Dr. Kendall is no more. He has
fought the good fight: lie has been re
lieved from duty; he has crossed over
the river: he has joined his comrades
on the other shore. "those choicer spirits
who, holding their conscience unmixed
with blame, have been, in all conjec
tures, true to themselves, their country
and their God."
