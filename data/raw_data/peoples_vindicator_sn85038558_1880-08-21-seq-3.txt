The new School Board did not as
same control as it was decided that
under the law, i. e. late decision of
the Supreme Court regarding ap
pointments made during adjourn
ment of the Senate, the old Board
held over. As these Boards are not
confirmed by the Senate, nor are
they appointed by the Governor
even, we cannot see how the quoted
decision covers the case. Neverthe
lees, we hope the old Board will reor
ganize the schools of the pearish and
open them to the public as soon as
practlcable. We suggest that Ward
I be canvassed with a view of the
founding of a first class public
school, to be maintained by the ex
tra taxation we are allowed to la
dulge ourselves in under the law.
The monied apportionment is too
meagre to hope that it will in any
way, keep open a good school for the
time requited, and we hope our sug
gestion will be acted upon at once.
Jewish Analversaries.
Our Jewish friends should bear la

The eotton, asu we mentioned list

the yield will be small. In tact,
this is what alarms the farmer more
than the worm. We have heard
many theories advanced other than
the rainfall for this bad fruiting.
These theories are at least worthy of
some consideration. We understad

BrusN, Grocers, New Orleans. was
with us a few days last week and de

As the host of friends of our popu

anxious to know of his whereabouts

uing notice of him from the New Or

Mr. J. F. SHANSY. business mana
ger of the Natchitoches i'tndicator,
and a well known newspaper man,
having been for many years con
nected with the press of New Or

comes in the interest of the Vind ca
tor, and will present the merits of
that sterling paper to the commer
cial community, with a view to the
renewal of business relations with
some and the beginningof those re
lations with others. The Vindicator
has a large circulation and influence
In the Red river valley, and no bet
ter medium of communication with
that section of the State can be se.
cured. It is with peculiar pleasure
that the DEMCeRA commends Mr.
SHANY to the business men of New
Orleans, feeling satisfied that they
i cannot do better in the way of coun
try advertising than by giving the
Vindicator their patronage.
The City Item, of the 13th, with
the proprietors of which Mr. 8HANSv
has bben agm ated for a quarter of
a century, t nh welcome him:
We had a pleasant call this morn

RichaRD McLEAN, Esq. The Genius
of Liberty may inform its readers
that Mr. Mc LEAN, during a residence
of fifty odd years here, has won and

all who have been honored with his

ABSENT FIFTT-Two YStus. - Mr.
Richard McLean of the State of Lou
islana, Is on a visit in this place and
vicinity, having arrived in Union.
town last week. Mr. McLean ln a
brother to Burgess McLean of this
place and a grand son of Col. Alex
ander McLean who was Register and
Recorder of PFtyette county from the
organization of the county In 1783 to
the day of his death in 1834, a period
of 61 years. Richard McLean the
subject of this memoir was born in
1810, and Is therefore 70 years of age.
In 1828 he emitratted to Louisiana
and located on Bed river at Natch
Irochee, where he hbs since resided.
His place of birth was hi a log house
which stood near the present reel
denceof BRuston Craig in North Union
township, this county. Samuel,
James and George McLean of North
Union township, and Miss Alsv and
Miss Elizibeth Hadden, of Union
town are his nearest relatives In this
vioinity except his brotherabove men
tioned. Mr. McLean is well preserv
ed for one of his age, and perhaps
the only native of Fayette Co., living
or dead, who resided continuouely
for 52 years elsewhere and afterwards
returned to the place of his birth.
Shortly before leaving home he met
Major George F. Dawson, the young.D
er brother of Bon. John L., Dawson,
dee'd, who resides 4( miles from
Natohlitooboe, and the Major sends
his kinld regards to the editors of
this paper for which we "return
thanks." Mr. MoLean after visiting
the few persons yet living that he
resiollects in his early yoUth will re
turn t hlahome.

State is fli'er lr,,l.
It seems to us that the Louisiaoa
public are entitled to some little
light regarding this University diff
cult:. Now that Prot. Born has been
di.placed--that Is, as sentence has
been passed and executed upon the
one man who has, through personal
exertion, kept alive this institution
of learning--it would be well to put
him on trial.
The air has been full of charges
but we fird no proofs.
Will the Board please explain ?

That Unifrersity Again,
(ovt. MicEnery returned yesterday
from Baton Rouge, where he bas
been attending the meeting of the
hoard of auperviaers of the State
Tlliveralty. He brought with him a
copy the petition that had been serv
ed upon each and every member of
the board, excepting the governor,
euprentendent of public education
and president of the faculty of the
University, who are ex-officlo mem-.
bers of the board. The suit was filed
in the Seovnteenth Jodlelal District
Court, parish of East Baton Rouge,
and is brought by G. A. Oraham
and others, against Leon Jastremaki
and others. The plalntiffs alledge
that, although their term of offiee
expired in January, 1880, yet they
are entitled under the law to continue
In office until their successors in of
lice are appointed. The board is en
trusted with the receipt and diaburs
menrit of over $20.000 annually, which
the defendanta are seeking to con
trol. The plaintiffs urge In support
of their suit, matters similar to those
which decided the Supreme Court
to give judgement in favor of the old
Board of Flour Inspectors. They
alno contend that the defendants are
intruding into the ofioe which right
Fully belong to them.- [N. O. Times.
