NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL.
The people of Latayette, who had
learned to admire Catherine Cole's
talent, were surprised and pained in
reading last ,Sunday's Times-Dem
ocrat to find an article written and
signed by that gifted writer, who
seems to take especial pleasure in
speaking disparagingly of those,
who, in the past, were glad to extend
her that open-handed hospitality for
which they are justly famous.
Since the talented lady has visited
the unpretentious villages of Louis
iana, she has had occasion to spend
some time in the highly cultured
society of American and European
cities, and she may have become a
trifle too esthetic, but it appears to
us that she could afford to be a
little more lenient toward the peo
ple of her own State, even though
they have not attained the dazzling
eminence in the intellectual world
enjoyed by their distinguished
censor.
Not many years ago, Catherine
Cole exerted her facile pen in eulo
gizing the people of South Louis
iana; now she out-Cables Cable in
an attempt to belittle them in the
eyes of the world. Her dismal
picture of the Louisiana town
would do credit to the most malig
nant and malevolent South-haters
of the North.
Nothing has ever been more ex
aggerated than the reports sent to
the daily papers by their represen
tatives at the execution of the Blanc
brothers. The crowd, though a very
large one, was exceedingly quiet
and orderly. There was not a dis
turbance of the peace and not a
single arrest was made by the police
on that day. The fence was torn
down only after the execution, and
the "woman who took an active
part and was one of the first to
reach the awful altar" is not a na
tive of this country, but is of im- t
ported stock, being one of that
class who always serve their appren
ticeship on the foul-smelling streets
of New Orleans before venturing
into the rural districts of the State.
This, in a measure, accounts for
their toughness.
Everything connected with the
crime, the trial and conviction of
the Blancs made this case a very
sensational one, and the people of
this section were naturally inter
ested in their execution; but to say
that they displayed any blood
thirsty disposition is to say that
which is not true. It is doing al
grave injustice to people who have j
shown themselves to be law-abiding,
peaceable and humane citizens.
The Blanc brothers were the self- t
confessed perpetrators of as foul and
fiendish a crime as ever darkened
the criminal annals of any country.
They were arrested, tried, and, af
ter beingdefended by the best legal
talent of the land, were convicted
and sentenced to be hanged.
During their imprisonment they
made a murderous assault on the
sheriff, but despite this attack on his
life the sheriff treated them with un
remitting kindness. This fact was
attested by the murderers them
selves when the fatal noose was
about to be adjusted around their
necks. Even the family of the man
they murdered sympathized with
them in their unfortunate predicpa
ment and tried by several beneficent
acts to lessen :the horridness of the
giLbbet. A benevolent clergyman
attended them* in their last hours
and accompanied them to the scaf
fold. Men condemned to die
were never better and more
humanely treated.
It was a quiet, well-managed ex
ecution, and there was nothing in
the condact'of the vast throng which
showed the existence of a blood
thirsty sentiment. If thdre was an
inhuasa feeling it existed only in
the vivid minds of the newspaper
_eporters and Catherine Cole. After
the execution' - the bodies of the
rjothers were taken to the Catholic
church and given Christian buriail.
And It: nlkghtrplehse Cathetine Cole
y to know :thnt since the intermeat
some good-hearted -_women have
caused a requiem mass to be said
for the souls of the unfortunate
young men.
Before holding up a community
to public view as an aggregation of
semi-civilized brutes and "blood
thirty leeches," the distinguished
member of the Times-Democrat's
staff should first have inquired into
the truthfulness of the reports
spread broad-cast over the country
by men whose business it is to deal
in sensational rot.
It is to be hoped that some day
the laws will be administered in
New Orleans as they are in Lafa
yette parish. Although *"more or
less remote from the contagion of 1
the great city's civilization," the
people of Lafayette have never
found it necessary to kill inno
cent men in their cells by shooting
them down as if they were mad
dogs; and, too, after they had been
vindicated by the courts.
It is true that there is not
a free circulating library in
Lafayette, but thank God our local
government has not been in the
hands of blacklegs and boodlers and
our criminal courts are free from
the contaminating influence of jury
fixers and corruptionists of the
blackest type.
The fact that a few unthinking
men scrambled for pieces of the
rope is pictured in ghastly colors
by Mrs. Fields, who would create
the impression that the people of
Lafayette behaved in a manner that
would shed lustre upon the unenvia
ble fame of New Orlean's petted and
favored hoodlums. If this action
of a few over-grown boys 4
is to be taken as evidence
that the people of Lafayette
have a murderous taste, will Cath
erine Cole please use her great de
scriptive powers to tell of the
cruelty of the people of the city
of New Orleans, who tore down
the doors of the old parish prison
and butchered eleven defenseless
Italians and hung one to a lamp
post and swung another to a tree?
The morbidly inclined did not only
"'cut the hemp in small bits,"
but proceeded to cut the
three in little pieces which
they carried away as trophies of
their ugly work. And this exhib
ition of what Catherine Cole would
call a "taste for murder" did not
take place in a "railroadless, thea
terless, streetcarless, libraryless"
country settlement. It was on a
beautiful, sunlit day in the very heart
of the great Southern metropolis
which claims the brainy Catherine
Cole as one of its brighest lights
and the Times-Democrat as its
greatest journal.
A TARIFF ABOMNA TION.
The Springfield (Mass.) Repub
lican, an influential Republican
journal, says:
"And what for, if there is no
straw matting industry in this coun
try to be developed? The ingrain
carpet manufacturers demand the
change in their interests. They
want people to be compelled to buy
their goods instead. The market
for ingrain carpets has been re
duced somewhat by the preference
for mattings. This must be
stopped, and so Mr. Dingle} pro
poses to stop it by doubling the
Iprice of straw anattings. Mean
time, also the prices of ingrain car
Spets are to be advanced-must be,
because of the demands of the wool I
Sgrowers not produced in this coun- I
rtry, and if people who prefer straw
Smattings are taken by the throat
I and compelled to prefer ingrain
carpets, the ingrain manufacturers
t can the more easily overcome the
Sdisadvantage of high wool duties.
i There is method in all tariff mad
Sness, and here is the method of this
particularly mad and unconscion
able proceeding. It is a case of
taxing a popular preference into
submission to the wishes of a single
selfish interest. It is like taxing
wheat to compel people to eat
I corn, or meat to compel them to
eat fish, or wool clothing to compel
Sthem to wear cotton, or wooden
]houses to compel them to build
r brick and so profit the brickmakers.
r It is an unmitigated outrage, and
Sought to cost the Republican party
thousands of votes."
