The platform of the Jackson,

"Good graveled road, diversified

Because some people in Bienville
parish resolved to support only bi
metallists for legislative offices the
Banner-Democrat says they are fa
natics. By what process of reason
ing our esteemed contemporary has
come to such a conclusion will per

who are sincerely in favor of a bi
anetallic currency vote for goldbug
legislators they may earn the good
opinion of the Banner-Democrat,
but the balance of the world will
look upon them as the most pictur
esque idiots in the union.
It is an emphatic fact of the
times that the despondency of
Dem crats at the close of last fall's
election has measurably disap
peared. The victors of x894 have
qaite as many troubles of their own
as those which afflict the van
quished. Their success at the polls
has been followed in every state
and locality by factious strifes, by
notorious and disgraceful quarrels
over the distribution of the spoils,
and by the jealous rivalries of
:; "liques and candidates for future
~promnotion.-Acadia Advance.

"4 eVTOL T7JNG ,MURDER.
In Our local cilumnis.is an ac
count :of the killing of' a negroQ
named Ovide Belizaire by-a band
of masked men. The evidence
brought out at the examination held
by Coroner Gladu while placing the
guilt on no one, shows beyond the
shadow of a doubt that a cowardly,
" premiditated and unprovoked muz i
dea has been committed by a gang
of desperate hoodlums bent on the
shedding of human blood. The
evidence shows that this negro was
shot down in his own house where
he had a perfect right to be; that
he was peaceably at home with his
family when a number of armed
men forced their way into his hum
ble cabin and killed him under the
- very eyes of his wife and children,
5 who unfortunately were too fright
ened to recognize any of them.
IAfter being shot and fatally
wounded with a bullet in his .head
and one in his lungs, he jumped out
of his house through the window
r and walked a few feet away where
he was found the next morning a
corpse with his shot gun near by.
It appea s from the testimony of
the coroner's inquest that the party
of men were searching for the negro
Soulouque who seems to have given
offense to some people in that sec
tion, but we have failed to hear
any excuse advanced for the killing
of Belizaire. What this poor ne
gro had done to deserve such pun
ishment no one seems to know.
What crime was he guilty of that
he was shown so little meroy?i
None that we know of. He was
probably killed for trying to defend
himself in his own home. Every
thing connected with this horrible
midnight tragedy points to it as a
most barbarous and revolting crime.
In cases wherein negroes are guil
ty of great crimes the people are
justified in dealing out summary
justice to them, but when the ne
cessity exists these extreme meas
ures are carried out in the day light
and without masks. People who
cover their faces with masks to
I avoid identification accomplish no
good. The simple fact of masking
themselves shows unmistakably
that they are afraid to face the
consequences of their acts-and no
well-meaning and honest man
should.
The Gazette hopes that the par
ties responsibl: for this murder will
be brought to justice and will re
ceive condign punishment.

In the matter of the sugar bounty
the United States government is
certainly not pursuing a course cal
culated to inspire the people with -t
a very high opinion of its sense of
justice and fair play. From the be
ginning the sugar planters of Louis
iana have been treated in a very
shabby manner. After months of
wrangling Congress decided to pay
the planters a small portion of
what they were honestly entitled to.
Upon this promise they went brave
ly to work, anticipating no further
trouble in the collection of the
bounty, but recently Comptroller
Bowler, of the treasurey, seems to
have been suddenly seized with an
inordinate desire to discover some
comstitutional points which will
again necessitate the postpone
ment of the bounty payments. The
planters have been granted an ex
tension of time until Aug. 7 to ap
pear before the comptroller and
present their side of the case.
Withthat end in view they have
employed the well known attorney,
Hen. Thos. J. Seminmes, who will
endeavor to show the constitutiona
lity of the bounty payments. The
Louisiana representatives and sena
tors in Congress have been re
quested to be on hand as it is be
lieved that their co-operation may
prevent a conspiracy on the part of
government officials to postpone
the payments, as it is claimed that
the treasury department is unwilling
to pay out much money owing to
the bad condition of the finances.
Should the comptroller decide
against the Ilanters an appeal will
doubtless be made to the Su
preme Court, where the constitu
tionality of the law will gbe fianlly
tested.
'W\Ve had an epidemic of dysentery

Times-Democrat. -"
F The next Congress will have to
issue a warning to the railroads in
regard to the law requiring them to
use safety appliances. This law
.was passed some time ago in re
sponse to the demands of both
Democratic and Republican parties,
and the railroads were required to
have train brakes and automatie
couplers within a certain number of
years. It was hoped that the rail
roads would proce d to carry out
the law at once, but they have so
far refused, leaving the improve
ments to the last minute of the time
- allowed them, when it will be diffi
cult to put them in operation.
The report of the Inte state Com
merce Commission shows that 75
per cent of the total equipment of
r the railroads is without train brakes
I and 73 per cent without automatic
t couplers, both of which are essen
tial to the safety of the employees,
and the absence of which is respon
t sible for the large number of acci
dents occuring daily. The delay
f of the railroads to carry out the
law would indicate that they have
no intention to obey, and when the
time finally comes for its enforce
- ment will find some way of dodging,
as they have done so often before.
Congress would do well, therefore,
- to make the punitive part of the
law as strong as possible and stop
the frightful slaughter of the rail
road employees which now goes on,
and which exceeds in a year the
losses of any of the world's, great
battles.

Scandalous Charges Itefuted.
Great deal of excitement was
caused in Houma and surrounding
towns during the week over the arrest
of Rev. Father Charles Richard of
Chacahoula, La., who was charged
with outrages committed on the ix
year daughter of Mr. G. G. Aucoin
of that place. The Rev. Father
was arrested on Tuesday, but was
not '"brought up and put safely in
jail," as was stated in Wednesday's
Picaytune.
Lately it seems a hobby to slan
der priests, and some papers take
a delight in condemning a man
without hearing any defense.
Father Richard spent the night
in the court-house, with Sheriff Con
nelly, hut received kind and cour
teous attention. A preliminary
trial was held on WVeenesday before
Hon. L. P. Caillout, in which sev
eral witness were examined, and
the result was that tUe reverend
father was discharged and exone
rated. Never Defore was such a
scene witnessed when the honora
ble jugde discharged the. wronged
priest. Pandemoniuti, reigned,
hats was thrown in the air, and
everybody in the court room came
forward and shook the hand of the
kind priest. It was proved beyond
a doubt that the charge was a slan
derous and false one, and totally
without foundation. The reverend
father is a zealous and p;ous priest,
and has done more for that commu
nity that any other priest. The en
tire population of Hlouma is rejoic
;ng overthe vindication of Father
Richard, as well as his many friends
here and elsewhere.-Morning Star.
