Court, which would be'forwarded 1i.
mediately. I
The action of the grand jury in i
failing to bod a true bill againles Mr. t
Alston was a complete surprise to
.tery one. It will be seen by I
reference to the report that the
jury stood nine for a true bill I
and six against. There was no
question in the minds of all the jurors s
about Mr. Alston shooting Mr. Flan t
agan, and how six jurors could vote I
againtst naking a tree presentment, I
is muore than the 'public are able to
understand. Their action is without 6
parallel in the annals of the grand t
juries of Louisiana. t

SOne of the matters which mast
S come up before the Constitutioqsl
Convention is the reorganisatioJrof
d the Judiciary. The present arrange.
ment is generally considered to be a
bad one, and sveral substitutes are
proposea.
It is to be hoped that whatever
system is adopted, it will be so de.
r vised as to be not only economical I
D but also it to secure its object-- :
R wlich is the rendering of "speedy I
- justice." The word justiee by itself
I implies careful investigation, enlight
- ened Judgment, correct and unbiased
application of the law, accessibleness
to all, and uncostliness to the honest
B litigant; but all this is lost or defeat- I
ed if justice is not speedy.
I It is proposed by some to abolish
all the Parish Courts without increase I
log the number of District Judges; I
and they support this ,priucipally on
iconsiderations of economy-not r- e.
A ecting that such a measure would I
prevent justice itself from being I
speedily rendered. The Disrtict
Judges having so many more cases I
to try, would not be able, to get
through with them as fast as institu
ted; and therefore the numober await.
iog rial would becontinually increas
ing, so that at last eases woul4 not
come to their turn, on Ae calander,
till years elapsed. Tlrei when the
eases would be reached, they would
be tried in a hurry-not fully and t
deliberately discussed and considered a
-and wrongly decided, to the great I
disgrace of the judiciary, and the t
disrepute of the law itself. *We have
an example of this in our own Su a
preme Court, and another in the Sou t
peams Court of the United States. IIt
appears clear to all refecting mindsa
that, in leatters of this nature, the
point of econorey should be merely
secondary. We must havefirst of
all a sufficient number of eaopetent r
Judges; or give up the institution of
so-called courts of justice ns shaem.
By such a plan even economy is de
feated. It may be easily shown that
the eatra costs expenses and losses t
occasioned by the putting off of cases '
is ten times greater than the salary of
two or three more judges would
amount to. Every time a case is
postponed, the witnesses must be aem
moned again; and it often happens i
that cases, in which there are a con
siderable number of witnesses, are
continued as or eight times in a seae
sloo. Then when a long cas is on
trial, the witnesses In al the other
cases, after waiting for hours, are
dismissed; but afterwards summoned
again and again, only to suffer the
same inconvenience anew. This bi
swells the Clerk's and Sheril's fee i
bills enormously; but what is even
worse, the time of the witnesses is tl
wasted; and they suffer great detri- ,
meot and loss of wages, salary or bu. tt
siness. The parties and their law. C
ers suffer from the same cause. it
Debtors and their sureties fail; p
witnesses die or go away. All this
amounts, in the parish of Orleans, to to
at least three handled thousand del- Cs
lars per annum. True, the State pl
Treasury, by the fewness of Judges, Is
seaves Atiteen or twenty tbousad del. tI
larss, but the people spend or lose he
twellty timaes more.
To diseuncomber the docket of the d
Supreme Court, it is proposed that "1
appeals be allowed only in eases in t
which the amonot exceeds two or
three thousand dollars. This is sub- a
astitoting a total denial to the lw ow
attainment of justiee, ina r reat ms.
jorihy of ases. The luaury of ma
appeal eould only be enjoyed b tile
ric; for th coummon rum of people
hardly ever bhave suits for two or in
three thousand dollars. There was
a atkling lnstaneo of this in the fa
mona Gaino ease. Ilouadreds of the
defendants could not appeal from the
deieien, rendered by Judge Billings,
because the property they were die Ti
poesased of resapectively w valued
otless tbhn P0G0. _ Only a few of a
tie defendants hell pieee worth

sad here is a plan to thateffet:
Abolish the Parish Courts.

Preserve the Supreme Court.
Create Mree intermediate Courts of
Appeal, each eomposed of three
judges, to whibch all. appeals shall be

leans. Let the one for the country $
have sessions in Batoo Bouge, Opo
loers and Monroe; and let each of
the two for Orleas have appellate
juridicetion over an equal nuoomber of
ibe District Courts of that parish.
Make the Juriediction of the Courts
