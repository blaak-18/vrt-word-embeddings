Symptoms of a Diseased Liver. o
DAIN in the right side, under the W
1 edge of the ribs, increases on pres- H
surly sometimes the pain is'in the left to
side; the patient is rarely able to lie er
on the left side; sometimes the pain hi
is felt under the shoulder blade, and a
it frequently extends to the top of the a
shoulder, and is sometimes mistaken til
for rheumatism in the arm. The stom- a
ach is affected with loss of appetite et
and sickness; the bowels in general .,
are costive, sometimes alternative with tb
lax; the head is troubled with pain,
accompanied with a dull, heavy sen- di
sation in the back part. There is gen- r,
erally a considerable loss of memory, a
accompanied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done. A slight, o
dry cough is sometimes an attendant.
The patient complains of weariness le
and debility; he is easily startled, his i"
feet are cold or burning, and he com- p1
plains of a prickly sensation of the *
skin; his spirits are low; and although ra
he is satisfied that exercise would be "l
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely It
summon up fortitude enough to try it. al
In fact, he distrusts every remedy. pI
Several of the above symptoms attend ta
the disease, but cases have occurred

[London News, November 21st.] ii
John Ward, otherwise Charles ih
Peace, is a person of some distinction -
in his line of business. Like many a
other people, be has at last fallen a u
victim to that reckless practice of i
overtrapling, which has done so mcih h
mischief in every branch ofeommerce. i
Ward's transactions, it is true, were I
of the sort which Aristotle describes M
as "Involuntary" on one side-he i
was, in fact, a professional burglar. I4
He did not fly at the high game core tl
ted by aristocratic robbers. He net- Ii
er, as far as appears in the report of
his trial, laid hands on the jewels of Ii
a bride or went of with the dressing- i
case of a Coniitese. He never seised i
the plate of a Cathedral, like thel t
celebrated elacekmsonen of the last len- li
eration,. His lhusinesns was almost f
cintiely cotlited to the de spoilinlg of ti
the middle classes, which he executed I
with pmro.ptriude. punctuality and "
dispatch. Thlien the story of his ca. li
reer, as far an it has been revealed, v
casts little light on what may be I
called "the higher burglary." We i
have still to learn how the Duchess i
of Devonshire's portrait was spirited a
away, what beeame of Lady Dudley's a
jewels, and what manner and what v
number of men and women were d
concerned in these great and, to beor. f
row the expression of Gothe, these Ii
"typical plants." After all, though I
the scientiec consciousness may be t
allowed to play freely round those a
problems, they only personally con- t
cern a comparatively limited class. I
'People at large have no possessions a
valuable and portable enough to r
tempt the puofeasors of the higher i
burglary. Very few people (even; i I
these days of commercial shiftiness p
and suspicion) imitate the worthy I
couple who kept £16,000 in their t
bedroom, and £400 in a watch-pocket g
pinned on to their bed curtains. They i
were robbed of these sums, but they a
were quiet unusual people. It was a
ordinary people, pegtons "to mid4le I
fortune bore," that Ward plundered, a
and this fact gives his style, his fai,
a very wide interest. When brr
glaries are common in a whole dls
trict, in the town, or in the suburbs I
-as they generally are-if is usaaLto r
suspect the existence of a large gadg.
Very often, no doubt, a gnag ddes
exist. The ingenloui thids, who
dress themselves like footmen or ber
glars (just as Mr. Consul Fawcett's
Cossacks disguised themselves as
Bulgarians) to win the hearts alid ~
confidence of trustful ladies' maids we
have always with us. The plumbers I
out of work, who climb through the I
pipes; the glaziers without employ- !
ment, who enut through the windows; i
the desperate chimney-sweeps, whoe I
descend by the familiar fines, are IllI.
members of tie dangerous classes i
whose proceedings are familiar. They I
are only half professionals; thio I
have the timidity of the amateur, and I
they ran away when they hear a sql
on the stairs. We may com plrei
tihet to Maitre Frauoeois Villon, who e
was only a housebreaker whein he .i
could not help himself, when he hld'

for the mere delight is destroying
human life. Ward esaetbietween the
two cateaoriestfmere thieves and of
homicidal miscreants. He went arm.
ed, and was ready to shoot rather
than let himself be taken. An ordi.
nary robber, detected by the police
in the bouse of Mr. Bbrneia, in Black
heath, would have tried to run, and
would at most have defended himelft
with a crowber when hamigl were laid
ab-blar. Ward was detected by the 1
glimmer of the candle which lighted I
him in his search through the draw
iog-room of No. 2 St. John's Park.
He at once retreated by thelpar, and
was making for the lawn ihen Po. I
lies Constable Robinson encountered t
him. Then the desperate character of
the thoroughb-oing villain asserted
Itself. He Bred fve or six abots at
Robinson, who, nevertheless, rubshed
in and closed with him. It was pro
bably to the darkness, and to Ward's
want of skill, not to hLi. desire only I
to terrify, that Robinson owed his
life. When Ward eas ieized it was
found that his tevotver "was strapped
to his wrist. Probably the owuet of
the house and Iis' sIats were so
Inear a violent dd b as they 't. ever
likely ts be, and Yo s Ward

feat as courageous as any for which
war ofers an oppotunltyj. He re
deemed the character ofthe polies

over his earlier life, the polide must

er of a farmer residing near Fort
Edward, Washlington County, New
York, 'attracted muclh attention by
pretending to live without eating.
Her friends aided her in the decep
tion, their object being to secure cons
tributions of money from the pumer.
ous visitors who came from many
miles around to see her. Among
those who took an especial interest in
the case was Dr. Seoville, one of the
most prominent physicians of North
ern New York. This young woman
did not admit that she ate any thing
at all. It was claimed by herself and
friends that she lived on particles of
animal and vegetable matter which
floated in the air. This absurd claim
was so plausible to the mind of Dr.
Scoville that be wrote letters to seve
ral medical gentlemen in various
parts of the country describing to
them what he termed "one of the
most wonderful cases recorded in the
nineteenth century." Those who
visited the young woman found her
upon a feather-bed Ia one of the
farm bolaes with which the
country in that notion abounds. Alt
though she appeared weak and eam
lated, her limbs were not contorted
and her muscles were in their normal
condition. The parents were some
what ignorant country people, 'and
imagined that theycould impose upon
the redulity of educated physicians
with as much ease as they had de
ceived their farmer neigbors. The
only physician that they are said to
have misled was Dr. 'Scoville, and
there were parties who at the time
were uceharitable enogh to say that
he was privy to and sanctioned the
deception.
It was decided to establish a watch
at the bedside of Miss 'Briggs, and
thu prenlide the possibility of her
takinlg food without detectioe. The
watchers took turns in doing g$ard
duty, and the young eman wias
watched so closely that the eligbst
move she made eould not escape de
tection. Daring the third nigi flerv
the watch waset she was eosve .
to steatbily move one of her hands
toward the caroer of one of het pali
lows. The watchers pretended not
to noties bot sand she, growin more
bold, teac .inside the pillowcase
and took saiething therefrom, which
shhastily threat into her mouth. 1
An examination of the pillowease
wa made, and concealed theriin
were found 'a numbers of piles of
sodas crakers. Mise Brigge enfeesed
that, to please her fattier 'who ddeo
aired to Obtaei ,money from viittrs,
she had cgotp d to tlee tb.ede'.
ception., 'he aeknowdgedtt, a %,
ring all the :time of her pretended
faste, she .had "partaken of more or
less food.
