Are You
Sick?
Much sickness is due to
a weak nervous system.
Yours may be. If it is,
you cannot get well until
you restore nerve strength
Your nervous system is
nature’s power house; the
organs of your body get
their power from it. If
the power is not there, the
action of the organs is
weak, and disease (sick
ness) follows. Dr. Miles’
Nervine cures the sick
because it soothes the
irritated and tired nerves
and gives the system a
chance to recuperate.
Try it, and see if you do
not quickly feel its bene
ficial effect.

FARM AND RANCH, Dallas, Texas.
Says Tabored Class Controls Money
To the Editor of The North American.
At the present moment we are suf
fering from such a “money stringen
cy” as has never before been felt by
this country, at first sight, at a time
when it would seem that such a con
dition should be an impossibility, for
outside of “money” there is a con
dition of general plentitude.
“Demand and supply” are at high
tide; but, seek as we may, the mon
ey to purchase with and as well the
money to manufacture with are be
yond the reach of almost every pro
ducer and every consumer.
I venture to draw your attention to
the following facts taken either from
the latest Abstract of Statistics pub
lished by the government or from the
Twelfth Census:

Here we have a total 0f... 70,309,000,000
With annual transaction of. 177,346,000,000
A total of $247,655,000,000
♦lncomplete. IClearlngs.
Upon what amount of “cash” has
this been conducted 1 ? Less than
$3,000,000,000.
In other words, these United States
have been endeavoring to make a cir
culating medium or currency of $3
take care of an asset of S7O, exclud
ing the annual transactions of busi
ness.
What business man with $7,000 of
plant (excluding his output) could
hope to conduct a business justifying
that amount of plant investment on
S3OO of cash?
What business man with an annual
transaction of business to the amount
of $177,346 could hope to “pull
through by some hook or crook” had
he but $3,000 of cash?
What business man with a com
bined investment and annual transac
tion of business to the amount of
$247,655 could ever live with hut
$3,000 of cash?
Yet this is exactly what the pres
ent system of “currency” DE
MANDS the citizens of the United
States shall do.
What must be done in order to
meet the conditions as they EXIST?
In the first place it must be no
ticed that, large as th ©above amounts
appear, they ar n very far from indi
cating the actua> disparity between
“cash” and “necessary outlay,” for
these figures leave out the value of
a very large portion of plant equip
ment, personal property and AL
MOST ALL of the land values of
unmined coal and minerals or of un
cut timber; nor does it in one iota
recognize he v.iluof of existing water
powers or waterways.
That whi* h must be done is to
raise i i rculating medium or cur
rency I he point of providing for
each $! V invested or existing value,
and for each $1 of annual transaction
the amount necessary for their prop
er ’ n as demanded by their exist
ence n the hands of a private indi
vidu I.
3effetsonlan
In other words, the currency
MUST, in order to treat ALL with
that degree of similarity guaranteed
by the conditions of the individual
states and that of the United States,
provide the amount of CASH needed
by one individual who, with a plant
costing $70,309,000,000, has an an
nual transaction of $177,346,000,000,
or a total basis for “demand” of
$247,655,000,000.
Why is this not done?
In absolute defiance of the consti
tution, the present monetary system
has created a “preferred class” to
whom alone “money” shall be is
sued, viz., the class who can “pur
chase” United. States bonds, them
selves WORTHLESS as a means of
currency.
This has resulted in limiting the
issue of currency to EXACTLY THE
AMOUNT THIS PREFERRED
CLASS CAN HANDLE, and they,
therefore, are able to raise rates of
interest to 20 per cent, 40 per cent,
80 per cent, or even 120 per cent, per
year, and refuse to deal with any
person who will not pay them these
exorbitant rates.
Moreover, it has fostered that
method of “gambling” which allows
men who hold NOTHING to deposit
“certificates” therefor in the hand
of the “preferred class,” and it en
ables these “high financiers” to do
business on ONE FIVE-HUN
DREDTH of the cash needed for the
continuance of the lines of business
upon which these “nothing-worth
certificates” are issued.
A condition in which the purloiner
of merely the “name” of the asset
is able to realize, while the actual
owner of the asset goes into bank
ruptcy.
How may a proper currency be es
tablished?
We have in the government al
ready, the power to issue.
We have in the banks and trust
companies the power to scrutinize
the collateral offered and act as the
disbursing agents.
And we have in the incorporated
railroad, the manufacturer, the grow
er and the laborer all the necessary
collateral.
Moreover, while the prevalent idea
is that the “name” makes the “se
curity,” we have the real fact that
the SECURITY is made by the earn
ing power of the collateral.
True, this appears not to be so, so
long as the “preferred class” can
refuse to accept security other than
that upon which they can obtain usur
ious rates of interest; but behind this
“play upon the truth” the FACT re
mains.
We, therefore, need but to remodel
our laws to achieve this end, as fol
lows :
First—A “borrower” shall be enti
tled to a loan of 66 per cent of the
value of his collateral; that value to
be determined by the earning capacity
of the collateral on a 10 per cent an
nual basis.’
Second —A “bank” or “trust com
pany” shall be entitled to receive up
on deposit of such collateral, be it a
note, stock or bonds —or LABOR —
