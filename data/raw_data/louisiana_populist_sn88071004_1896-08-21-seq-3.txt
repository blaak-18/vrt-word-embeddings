Your presence encourages every
other man who attends, and a large

Intcrest of free silver by gdlllug
The hutigry democrats claim a
monoply of office-seeking and bit
terly denounce any polpulist who
would seek an ottice.
The leading deinoerats in this
State opetily declare that'they sup
port Bryan simply to hl,11 their
grip on the throats of tlhe State
government in the soulth. Yet
they expect Populists to follow
them.
Comrade.
The big grocery firm of John I.
Ada1ns & Co., of New Orleans,
have filed a petition asking for a
respite from their creditors of 28
months. Yet this is a glorious sys
tem of competition-for the few.
The Texas Populists have noipi
nated for governor Jerome C. Kear
by, and the famous "Stump" Ashby
for the second place, and they will
b? elec.ted. They also declare in
the most positive terms "no Wat
son, no Bryan."
Nonconformist.
Bryan makesa crushing argun
mont in nearly all his speeches,
which in a few lines completely
knocks out his adversary. It is
this: If the gold standard be a good
thing why not keep it permanently f
If it is not a good thing, why ask
the permiision of foreign nations to
let go of it I The republican pl)lat
form takes the position that it is
only to be adhered to until, by in
ternational agreement, the double
standard can be obtained. This
admits that bimetallism is right.

Cures Nervous Troubles and
Indigestion.
Mr. W. T. Nelson, president of
the second National Bank, of Jack
son, Tenn says: "For indiges
tion and nervous trouble, I ivould
rather give up any remeay than
King's Royal Germetuor. As a
nerve tranqluilizer and restorative,
it is all that can he desired. It is
not a narcotic in any sense, but
produces the happiest effects upon
the disordlered nervous system. I
consider it an savaluable remedy,
and have for several years been
recoommending it to my friends."

"I believe that my party is lbund

'1 congratulate the people on
the fact that the name I'opulist, inl

that party represent the basis of
true manhood in Georgia, alike
with the agricultural untsses that
5 form the great and conquer ing
Democratic column. Now is the
time to make one magnificent uti
I conquerable army of the people of

"If we can applaud the eloquent
young orator of the Platte, sutinly
it would not be discreditable in us

"Let us electrify th e union with

this is a battle otflpatriotisi against
money-a tight of boul against

"I believe in being sincere.
