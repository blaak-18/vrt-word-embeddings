St Martinville Messenger.
- The Messenger would have us
i, believe that talk of negro rule is al
aowsense. Our confrere is not so in
young that he has forgotten the ut
-edorous times of the last years of n
ie sixties. What kind of rule was a
t when Pinchback was lieutenant c
jgovernor of the State; when the m
#iuky-headed Dunn and C. C. An
toine held the same office, and m
later when several negroes held im- t
portant offices in St Martin, Lafa- s
yette and the other neighboring par- w
ishes. Our own parish had a bit- P
ter taste of it and only a few years t
can not efface from the minds of if
our white people the dark figure of q
black radicalism. s:

The Advocate has all along been
the staunch friend and defender of
the sugar planters of Louisiana. b
During the late furious fight made
against their interests we have con
sistently stood up for the sugar
planter and opposed a policy fz
which we deemed would be unjust l
to them. We have made an intelli
gent, consciencious figlt for a, duty T
on sugar on the Democratic theory a
of a tariff for revenue. This theory T
has triumphed and no sooner does In
this become an accomplished fact hi
than the planters meet and repudiate o
the efforts of all their friends by de- 0I
lfaring for protection as a principle,
and claiming the right to regulate p
their politics by their private inter
ests. Right here we part company. n
The Advocate is a friend of the su- b
gar interests of Louisiana but it will c
never consent to become an apolo- a
gist for such an obnoxious system
of political brigandage. We are a
Democrat, not for revenue, but as a
matter of principle founded upon T
honest convictions.-Baton Rouge
Advocate.
Carroll D. Wright, who went out t
to Chicago to investigate the Pull
man strike with a Pullman 1 ass in
his pocket, is having lots of fun
with the Western papers and with I
the laboi leaders, who seem to think
that the United States commissioner
of labor ought not to be a dead
head. There was certainly no
evidence of partiality in the examina
tion of witnesses by Mr. Wright and
his associate commissioners, and
there is no reason to expect any
partiality in their report; and yet
it would have been better not to
travel as Mr. Pullman's guest. But
Carroll D. Wright is a thrifty per
. on He is probably the highest
" id civil officer, except the Pres
- ldnt, in the service of the United
-attes. He is commissioner of
ls-bor with a salary of $5000 a year;
qprintendent of census, at $3ooo
yyiear, and chairman of the special
commission on the Chicago strike
,t So a day-say 3650o per anunm
--and expenses. There is ucques
Fionably room for the suggestion
-that out of this accumulation of
alrines Mr. Wright could afford to

with any opposition within the pi
party. An able and faithful service w
d of two terms in the lower house of w
Congress has endeared him to the ce
people of this district, who will show sa
their-approval of his course by re- ii'
s turning him to the Federal Con- it
r gress, of. which he has been an vi
honorable and useful member. It bi
g cannot be said that he has or will R
sacrifice sugar. His votes and o0
t speeches on that question show tc
t how true he has been to this, Louis- tt
te ana's chief industry. He is one of p1
the largest sugar manufacturers in d,
the State, and if a man cannot be al
e depended upon to look after his R
ao vn interests, upon whom can we fa
depend? Not only to sugar, but w
- to all the other interests concerning to
s the people of Louisiana he has been
v keenly alive. He has never failed
e to respond when called upon by his
constituents for small as well as D
it large favors. He is 5oung, vigor
ous, able and popular, and with c<
k him as the Democratic nominee, f
after the ides of November the dis- o1

is a national Repuolican, State Demo- C
crat and parochial Populist. He a
te may belong to no party and be a
1_ mugwump, but he cannot be a
d member of two or three parties at
the same time. Our sugar friends
started out as protectionists; they C
were next heard of as national Re- c
t_ publicans, and now they appear in
rs the role ot full-pledged Rads. And I
, if we may judge by the clippings -
) quoted below they will soon out
s:rip Kellogg and Warmoth and
read them out of the Republican
party as political heretics. -
The City Item, the organ of the
a. bolting planters, published the fol
le lowing editorial, whose unparalleled i
mendacity and gross absurdity will
ar cause every decent man to turn
y from it sick at heart. Says the
st Item:
' It is said, and truly at that, t'ltt the
ty Third Distract cannot he carrie:l unless th
Governor and his henchmlan convert it into
ry a slaughter pen, as they didl in day; of yor.^-.
ry The bye-word or phrase of the great clnti
lottery chieftain's bailiwick has heÂ·r '-if that
es nigger won't vote SUch and su:ch a ticket kill
ct hi. ':' The hands of many politicians fro11
the Third l)ictrict are crimson with the bo.lo
te of some poor innocent colored man, whose
e- only offense was that he had voted for the
party which caused his einancipataion.
e, Governor Foster's capi i.l, i ihis last comn- I
te paign, was the fact of hi; being a glorious
anti-lottery leader and a great nigger slayer.
'r- The times have changed si;ce then and
y. now the anti-lottery cry is dead and cinn:ot
be resurrected.
tt Owing to the recent split in the D)emo
ill cratic party the question of killing the ne
gro has got to be a two-edged sword. Sen
ator Caftery, who is a near and dear relative
:n of Governor Foster, is the recipient of a
diploma for the loyalty displayed by him to
a the nigger killing cause. On his hirth h:
s a carries many scalps taken from the hteatls of
the black men who had the audacity to op
on pose him in politics.
ge The next in line is the following
resolution adopted by the conven
)ut tion which nominated Mr. Kerno
ll- chan. It doubtless refers to the
in anti-mis-cegenation bill, the Jith
un Crow Car bill and the other bills
ith passed to keep the two races sepa
ink ate. Here is the resolution:
r "We condemn the reactionary legislation
e of our last and preceding Legislatures dis
ad- criminating against citizens of the State as
oppressive, unjust and humiliating to one
class, breathing the spirit of caste and tend
na- ing to establish permanent distinctions and
Lnd inequality in our free republic in violation
of the spirit of the Federal Constitution."
nd Another resolution adopted at the
Lny same meeting is the following:
yet "We denounce the Democratic .adminis
tration, national, State and municipal, as
incapable, treacherous and venal, and no
But longer deserving the confidence or support
Sof the people, and to their combinedl in
fluence must we ascribh the manifold ills
iest from which the people stuffer."
res CLASS LEGISLA TION.
ted Our worthy confrere of the St
of Martinville Messenger takes us to
tar; task because we said that the "boun
0 ty was too palpable class legislation
'ial to be endorsed by the masses," and
adds that "'to be consistent with the
nm party's policies we must advocate the
es- income tax, the most abnoxious kit d
o of class legisations; it is more," cor -
o :inues 2ur Bayou Teche brother,
t " it is a for-,m of persecution and
dge blackmail upon the industrious and
an, thrifty." Our friend is so mad with
the Democratic party because it
es abolishedthe bounty that he can't
see anything good in it. The
bounty money was extorted from
the the masses and given to a few hun
Exe- dred sugar manufacturers in this
the and'other states. The income tax
rew will be collected from wealthy per.
atic sons and the money will be used tc
.. .tt t2he goernment. Unlike the
'Wl4Od .lks<Y- it ncs taken from Tort
to"be more fos tate. If the
tax w c ted fro
nd en t e poor
ldl be c leg tion an h
emonoatic party oufd not have
passed a law so grossly inconsistent
with its principles. The people lan
who will be called upon to pay the in- by
come tax are atle todo so. For the not
sake of argument we admit thait the ta
incometax - is class legislation, but
it has the rare merit of being in fa
vor of the poorer class, who have 5
bourne the chief burden under the
Republican tariff and bounty laws, M
of which our erring brother seems
to be so fond. In order to relieve
the poor the Democratic party has ba
put a tax on the immense incomes po
deriving from the colossal fortunes of
amassed under laws enacted by the so,
Republicans. Just as a matter of in'
fact, how many of your subscribers la,
will be made to pay the income t
tax ?
