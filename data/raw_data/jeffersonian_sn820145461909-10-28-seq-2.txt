“THE HALF-CROPPER.”
By Mrs. B. F. Kennedy.
YING before me is a copy of
The Jeffersonian, in which
Sallie T. Parrish speaks pret
ty plainly of the “Half-Crop-
E
pers” of South Georgia.
This article may be found in vol
ume six, number eighteen, of The
Jeffersonian, bearing date October
14, 1909, and is on page two of that
paper.
Miss Parrish has put me to think
ing, and as the Hon. Thos. E. Watson
stands for truth and right, I am bold
to write about this matter, hoping
that we may see the facts as they
exist down here among us. I feel to
know nearly as much about our peo
ple, as a rule, as any one can, for I
have labored in Middle and South
Georgia among the poor and the
rich as a public school-teacher for
thirty-seven years, having taught
both in town and country, though
mostly in the latter, and I can but
feel sure that the writer of the
above-mentioned letter to The Jef
fersonian has been most unfortunate
ly placed as a teacher and observer.
I feel that she has not had a broad
and fair view of South Georgia as it
is, in that her paper on the subject
misleads. Since Tom Watson’s pa
pers and other printed works have so
wide a circulation, going as they do
everywhere in the United States and
into Canada, I think it is our duty to
give our dear Southland a fair dis
play—to let the light shine on the
clean bright spots as well as on those
that are dark. As teachers in the
schools of the State, we are employed
to serve this very people of whom
Miss Parrish speaks so unkindly.
We are expected to go among them
without prejudice, impartial in our
views and with an eye single to our
duty. This we can not do if we have
no faith in them.
Let us put our heads together, and
with our hearts in the work face the
charges against our neighbors and
candidly look at them.
Firstly, then, she says: “There
are hundreds, yes thousands, of half
croppers and wage-hands in South
Georgia.’’
We admit that. What would our
schools do without them? God bless
their bright boys and girls, for they
keep the schools running.
She says: “They are shiftless and
lazy.’’
Not all of them are, by a big ma
jority. We have drones among
teachers, preachers and “well-to-do
farmers’’ as well as among tenants.
As a rule a poor man has to hustle
to live, and Christ hath said: “The
poor ye have with you always.” So,
we had better be careful how we deal
with them, some of whose sons are
destined to become our lawmakers.
I have seen as much intelligence
displayed among the children of the
“Half-Croppers” as I have ever no
ticed anywhere else. The landlord’s
son does not outstrip the tenant’s
son in energy or interest in my
schools. As a rule the landlord’s
son looks to help from his father to
start him in business, while the ten
ant’s son looks to his own efforts for
his betterment in life.

She says further that “they never
learn from observation”.
Well, it does not always pay to
learn from observation.- Unless we
can observe something in the people
more fortunate than ourselves worthy
of calling a lesson, we had better not
learn from them. As to cooking and
housekeeping, I have visited among
all classes in my capacity as teacher,
and among the tenantry I have found
as clean beds and good food as I have
met with elsewhere, and always in
close company with an honest wel
come where the teacher is ever be
loved if he or she be true to “the
calling”.
And now I come to a charge
against my people that startles me.
She says: “In many cases less desira
ble than negroes!” If Sallie T. Parrish
could look into the homes of many
a tenant today she would see bright,
sturdy boys with flashing eyes,
clinched hands and trembling lips
looking at that. She would see the
A SONG IN A UTUMN
By Theodosia Garrison in Cosmopolitan
Autumn, Autumn, give me of your crimson,
Give it me for courage, for the year has left me meek;
And your crimson banners flying, as the sign of your defying,
Shall dare my heart’s denying the patience of the weak.
Autumn, Autumn, give me of your yellow,
Give it unto me for hope—the hope I could not hold;
For where your gold is burning I feel the dream returning,
The darling pain of yearning, whose passing left me old.
Autumn, Autumn, take me to your heart so,
The bold heart, the singing heart, whose strength shall
make me strong;
Send my healed life faring in colors of your wearing,
Your gold and crimson bearing, against a grief too long.
scornful curl of the daughter’s lips
and hear the derisive laugh of the
mother at the ridiculous picture—
and she might see a frown on the
father’s brow and a gleam in his eye
that would not speak well for her
safety if she were a “man”. But
chivalry is alive in the heart of a
Southern tenant as well as in that of
his landlord, and either of them will
pass a woman’s insult by where he
would strike a man. Woe unto the
"Beautiful Southland” when a wom
an can tell our sons and daughters
that they are inferior to a negro!
Will our boys and girls bow their
heads and say, “It is true?” We
teach them in school that they are
white, that they are to be citizens of
a free land, that they are of good
stock, that they are descendants of
the grand Confederacy, and above
the negro, and we expect them to
learn the lesson and to profit by it.
As to public dinners, if a dinner is
public is it not true that the public
is expected to eat it? If we are not
going to make everybody welcome to
our “dinner” we should not say
51)4. 'Seffcrsonian
everybody will be welcome, or the
dinner will be public, but should
serve our dinner at home, with those
present who will be welcome.
I admit that children do not go to
school as regularly as they should,
but the blame does not at all times
rest properly with the father and
mother. Sometimes they are so ham
pered they can not do as they would.
This is an open question which I
hope to live to see settled in away
which will better the school life of
our children.
Miss Parrish says: “Their mor
als are lax.”
Look out! Be mighty sure you
are right. This is a serious charge.
I have not found a laxity of morals
among the “Half-Croppers” more
than among the landholders, but I
have found as good morals, as pure
virtue, as fine principle, as much truth,
honesty and uprightness among the
tenantry as I have seen among the
so-called “upper classes”. The ten-
ant will compare advantageously in
this respect with the “well-to-do”,
and they do not all move every year,
either. I have neighbors who are
tenants and have remained in the
same houses for seven years, which
speaks well for both sides, and I
have a sister who has had the same
families on her farm for thirty years.
I have seen both men and women
with plenty of pride and ambition.
If their children wore “red dresses”
what of it? Why not red, if they
like it? There is economy in cutting
four dresses from the same piece, as
the scraps come in and help. I teach
my pupils as my mother taught me,
that it is not good taste to criticize
people’s clothing, and that if we can
not speak well of our neighbors, to
be silent. I would not be talking
now but that I feel somewhat hurt
at the charges laid against an hon
est, noble class of people, many of
whom are my friends.
“Half-Croppers’-’ do read, and some
of them read lots. Tom Watson’s
books and papers go into many of
their homes, along with other good
up-to-date reading-matter. I know
personally a girl of twelve years of
age who is a daughter of a tenant
and who won the prize in a contest
of three counties for the best essay
on the naming of the new counties.
She wrote the essay without help,
and the prize was sent to her by the
superintendent of one of the coun
ties.
We had better know what we are
doing when we step down to belittle
folks, for it is a dangerous thing to
do —and it speaks poorly of us as
leaders and teachers.
I can say with joy and humble
thankfulness that boys, the-sons of
poor men too, have gone from my
schoolrooms to become in after
years doctors, teachers, school super
intendents, and even “well-to-do”
farmers; and girls have gone forth
and made fine teachers and fond
mothers, with plenty of pride and
ambition. I have had the privilege
in some cases of teaching their chil
dren, and when it was so I felt like
I was teaching my own grandchil
dren.
WOMAN’S BEST AGE IS PAST
THIRTY.
I have been studying and writing
for some years on age and those
things which oppose it and render
it not only endurable but enjoyable,
and everything which touches upon
it is of interest to me.
Recently the editor of the New
York Evening Journal, discussing a
prominent actress and her play,
makes some good points on youth
and age that are worth thinking
about.
He says: “The play impresses
upon the public two valuable les
sons —one is due to the playwright,
one to the strong, consistent, con
scientious personality of the actress.
“A woman of sweet character has
j passed her earliest youth. She set
tles into old-maidhood. Her admir
er takes her at her own valuation,
and apparently ceases to care for her.
She decides, wisely, that she will be
young again. She abandons demure,
unsightly dress, gives nature a
chance, and—but see the play for
yourself.
“The play proves what every wom
an should know: That not years,
but lack of mental freshness, makes
a woman old.
“The highly-prized girlish years,
from eighteen to twenty-five, are
really years of babyhood.
“The most beautiful women in the
world, able to attract and hold the
greatest men, have almost invaria
bly been women past thirty—very
often they have been past forty.
“A woman lacking full mental de
velopment is like a green peach. She
may be very pretty to look at; but
that is all. Os course, if she is to
spoil before maturity, better take her,
as you would take the peach, when
it is a little green, rather than after
it has spoiled.
“And that fact—that women of
maturity attract men worth while—
is very unimportant compared with
this other fact: The mature woman
is the best mother.
