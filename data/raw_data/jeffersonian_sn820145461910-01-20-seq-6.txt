THE STATE TREASURY MUDDLE.
My Dear. Sir: —Will you please do
the people of Georgia the kindness
to tell them why it is that there is
such a loud dispute about the condi
tion of the State Treasury? The ad
ministration says its financial status
is one thing, and the anti-adminis
tration people say it is another. The
Atlanta Journal says that there is a
surplus in the Treasury, and the Sa
vannah Morning News says there is
a deficit. The books have been au
dited and still there is a dispute.
Why is it that figures tell one tale
for one crowd, and another tale for
another crowd? Why did not the
auditor know “where he was at”
when he got through with the job?
We were able last night, when we
closed, to tell the exact status of our
bank: how much cash, how much
assets, how much liabilities, etc. If
we had not been able to do this, our
president would have thought that
something was wrong with our bank,
our directors would have thought so,
and everybody else who had heard
such news would have had the right
to think so. Really, we are some
what puzzled about this dispute over
the financial condition of the State
Treasury. We can’t understand it.
Even the wool-hat boys are intelli
gent enough to see that definite in
formation ought to be at hand on
this subject.
I write you at the request of some
friends with whom I discussed this
today, and we hope I have not in
truded on your valuable time.
Very truly,
SUBSCRIBER.
Wadley, Ga.
Answer.
Your favor received. In my judg
ment, the dispute over the condition
of the State Treasury is a question
of bookkeeping. If you charge up
against the actual cash on hand, the
obligations which must be met out
of it, there is no surplus: if you
mentally obliterate those overhang
ing obligations, there is a surplus.
That seems to be about the size of it.
Very truly yours,
THOS. E. WATSON.
BELIEVES IN A DIRECT TAX.
Dear Sir: —I wish I could write my
appreciation of your writings. I have
been a reader of your papers since
the first issue of the old People’s
Party paper, and fully agree with
you on most all questions but the
tariff. I believe the National Gov
ernment should be supported just
like the State Government, by a di
rect tax. I think we should have
free trade in everything but men,
women and children, and I think
those should have a tax of SSOO per
head on every one of them that is
landed in the United States. I think
if we will stop foreign immigration,
we will knock out the recruiting sta
tion of the Socialists and the Anarch
ists.
Hoping that you will give these
questions some thought, I am
Your friend,
A. R. SANDERS.
Sweetwater, Texas.
Ed. Comment: I, also, believe that
the Federal Government should be
supported by a direct tax. If every
family could see just what enormous
indirect taxes it pays there would be.
a revolution. Estimating the aver
age family as numbering five souls,
it pays, yearly, to the Federal Gov
ernment, about $30.00 tax; and in
doing this, pays a tribute of $150.00
to the manufacturers, over and above
a fair price for the goods bought.
In all, therefore, the Tariff costs
each family SIBO.OO per annum.
WISH OTHERS WOULD DO A LIT
TLE WORK ON THE SIDE.
Dear Sir: —I have just mailed a
check to the Jeffersonians for three
subscriptions for three of my friends.
I have been handling your Magazine
at my stand for some time, but lately
I have become so much enthused
with the work you are doing until I
just got out and did a little work “on
the side”. It took but a moment to
show them the Magazine, and it did
the rest. All are impressed, and
many have become acquainted for
the first time with the infamous
teachings of Socialism. Go after
them, for if the people fail to heed
such warnings as you are giving,
then God help us. And many, hav
ing read your articles on that sub
ject, are impatiently awaiting the
commencement of the expose of Ca
tholicism. Sound the warning, for
you MUST be heard.
My first acquaintance with you
was when, as a plowboy, I read your
“Napoleon” as it was published in
the Sunny South or the Constitu
tion, have forgotten which. And one
of my first purchases in the book
line, after leaving home, was “Napo
leon”. I have it now, and would not
part with it for anything.
Pardon a suggestion: Can’t you
give us ia little editorial on the re
volting murder of Ferrer? Was it
Catholicism? I think so. And what
of Clemenceau? Has clericalism si
lenced forever his mighty- voice?
And, in conclusion, I have en
closed an article from the pen of
Ella Wheeler Wilcox, in which she
quotes a speech made by a negro. I
have marked a paragraph, and
would like you to say how that
sounds to one who KNOWS.
Now a personal word or two: I’m
a South Carolina Democrat; i. e., a
“near” Populist. Have never voted
anything but the Democratic ticket,
and will continue to vote that way,
unless, well —unless Tom Watson
runs again.
Best -wishes to you—long life to
The Jeffersonian.
Very truly yours,
J. E. KING.
Sumter, S. C.
Ed. Comment: The first “Napo
leon” referred to must be the story
which I sent to the Sunny South in
1876. It began with a description
of a grand ball in Napoleon’s palace
—the Tuilleries.
I did have editorial on the murder
of Ferrer. He was the victim of
Catholic priests. Those fanatics are
capable of any crime.

AN INDEPENDENT CONGREGA
TION.
Dear Sir: —I have been reading
your Jeffersonians for nearly two
years, and have learned more from
them than from reading all other
papers for twenty years.
I have never voted in the National
elections because I could not vote
the Republican ticket, and would not
vote the Democratic. If I can find
out the way you vote from this time
on, I think there will be two votes
alike in old Georgia.
Your Foreign Mission articles are
fine. I nearly got turned out of the
Baptist church because I did not be
lieve in Foreign Missions; but I have
never given anything to them in my
life, and never will for that pur
pose.
They have now put Mexico, Cuba,
Panama and the Isle of Pines on the
Home Mission Board, so that leaves
nothing for us but State work, —but
there is enough of that to keep us
busy as long as you and I live.
Our pastor said that Tom Watson
was a very dangerous man. It was
Dr. J. M. Brittain. We had to ask
3effersonlan
him to resign, so we will not have
to listen to his beloved Chinese talks
any more.
Yours truly,
GEO. E. BARRETT.
Atlanta, Ga.

will leaven many a down-trodden,
hen-pecked congregation, this year.

DID HE VOTE RIGHT?
Dear Sir: —You will find enclosed
one dollar bill, for which send the
weekly Jeffersonian to E. M. Mad
dox, Haynesville, La. lam not much
of a writer, wish I were, i would help
you out with your fight against class
legislation, but I can• say this, that I
am forty-one years old and have
never voted an old party ticket, and
never expect to as long as I keep my
right mind. Well, keep putting it
to the Socialists and Foreign Mis
sions and both the old parties. Say,
Bro. Watson, where can I get the yea
and nay vote in the last Congress?
I would like to have it and see how
our Mr. Ransdell voted.
This subscription entitles me to
the Handbook on Missions, I guess.
I think I will send in some more
soon.
Yours for all the good I can do,
M. A. WINN.
Haynesville, La.
Ed. Comment: The Congressional
record fills many large volumes, and
the yea and nay votes are scattered
all over the series.
Will look up some of Mr. Rans
dell’s votes. Am under the impres
sion that he voted right. T. E. W.
A GEORGIA BOY IN OKLAHOMA.
My Dear Mr. Watson: —I am
writing to inquire as to the subscrip
tion prices of your Weekly paper and
Jeffersonian Magazine.
Oklahoma is a Democratic State
by a good majority.
There are quite a few Southerners
and a number of Georgians in our
town, Claremore; occasionally I dis
cuss politics, Populist, Democratic
and Republican, with the men com
ing in the office, and find few are
ignorant of, or not in sympathy with
“Tom Watson”.
I have read all of your books and
am especially fond of the Story of
France and Bethany, and I wish to
thank you again for your kindness
in presenting me with your books—
remember several years ago, you
made me a present of all of the
books you had written up to that
time.
I am doing the stenographic work
for the above law firm and studying
law at the same time.
Trusting that I may have the pleas
ure of hearing from you at an early
date, with kindest regards and best
wishes, I am,
Sincerely yours,
FRANTZ J. HOLTZENDORFF.
Claremore, Okla.
ANOTHER VOLUNTEER GUARD.
Dear Sir: —I am a thirteen-year
old boy who reads your paper every
week. In looking over your paper I
saw a letter from my cousin, R. H.
Tootle, of Manassas, Ga. His letter
read like the good old Pops might
have to guard your home; if so, my
friend, call on me and my father, for
he is as strong a Pop as there is, I
think, and if I could only vote you
would have got one more vote in
1908 than you did. I will try to
follow in your footsteps when I am
a man.
Wishing you and your paper all
success,
I am,
ARLING TOOTLE.
Glennville, Ga., Rt. 4, Box 30.
AFRAID WE’LL BOTH GET TIRED
X* LIVING THAT THOUSAND
YEARS.
Dear Sir: —Will you allo-w me
space in your valuable paper for a
letter. I am a thoroughbred “Watson
ian,” and greatly admire your writ
ings. I am writing about the char
acter of Napoleon Bonaparte.
We may now pause before that
splendid prodigy, which towered
among us like some ancient ruin,
whose frown terrified the glance
its magnificence attracted. Grand,
gloomy, and peculiar, he sat up
on the throne a sceptered her
mit, wrapt in the solitude of
his own originality. A mind,
bold, independent and decisive; a
will despotic in its dictates, an en
ergy that distanced expedition, and
a conscience pliable to every touch of
interest, marked the outline of this
extraordinary character; the most
extraordinary, perhaps, that ever
rose, reigned, or fell. Flung into life
in the midst of a revolution that
quickened every energy of a peo
ple who acknowledge no -superior,
he commenced his course a stranger
by birth, and a scholar by charity.
With no friend but his sword,
and no fortune but his talents, he
rushed in the list where rank, and
wealth, and genius had arrayed
themselves, and competition fled
from him as from the glance of des
tiny.
He knew no motive but interest,
acknowledged no criterion but suc
cess; he worshipped no god but am
bition, and, with an Eastern devo
tion, he knelt at the shrine of his
idolatry. Subsidiary to this, there
was no creed that he did not profess,
there was no opinion that he did not
promulgate, tn the hope of a dynasty.
He upheld the Crescent, for the sake
of a divorce he bowjed before the
cross; the orphan of St. Louis, he
became the adopted child of the re
public; and, with a parricidal in
gratitude, on the ruins both of the
throne and tribune, •he reared the
throne of his despotism. -
A professed Catholic, he imprison
ed the Pope; a pretended patriot, he
impoverished the country; and, in
