tOOSEVELT AND HIS COLORED
BROTHER.
A great deal of space, is being wasted
5 over the criticism of President Roose
velt who persists in entertaining nig
gers in his private or official capacity.
It is a matter of taste which concerns
Roosevelt, who may be left alone to the
enjoyment of his relations with his col
ored brother. Southern men, especially
the accredited representatives of the
- South, should maintain the dignity of
their positions and their self-respect as
gentlemen, by giving Mr. Roosevelt all
the latitude he may desire in his asso
ciation with his colored brother. Why
should any gentleman attend a gather
a ing where the guests invited are not
congenial? If left to his own selection
f associates and there are niggers of
high or lew degree, Roosevelt will soon
ealize that while he is "strenuous,' a
'self-willed" man, a man of great and
resourceful energy, that he can not,
after all, alter the leopard's spots, nor
the laws of nature. Let Roose
welt enjoy to the fullest his relationship
and companionship as his taste and
fancy may suggest. Give him full swing
in the enjoyment of his receptions and
his recognition of the negro as his so
ial and political equal. The negro is
fectly right in accepting every re
nition from Mr. Roosevelt and he
shuuld insist on greater considerations,
t let it be borne in mind that men
- r powerful than Roosevelt have
Bed in the impossible.

D A FATAL AFFRAY.
4 One Man Killed and Four Wounded
Near Nacogdoches.
. On Sunday afternoon an affray occur
s red at Manton, a camp thirteen miles
e below Nacogdoches, Tex., where several
l_ hundred men are employed in clearing
;y and preparing land for an orchard.
e Among the men are a number of Mex
If icans. The camp was in charge of a
s young man, Nathan McGee. A dispute
11 arose among some Mexicans over a
.. game of cards. When McGee attempted
y to restore order he was assaulted by two
Mexicans. In defending himself he shot
4 one of the Mexicans and was shot at the
n. same time by one of the assaulters. As
,f he fell he shot a third .man and before
n expiring he mortally wounded the
a fourth assailant, who will die. The ne
d groes in this camp have been aroused
, against the Mexicans, but no further.
r trouble is apprehended.

ORIGIN OF FAMOUS HYMNS.
Storees About the, Writing of Some
of the Greatest Favorites.
Every one perhaps has his or her f^
vorite hymn, yet few know its author
and under what circumstances it was
composed. Hitherto there has been no
good book on the subject, but that de
feet is now remedied, thanks to the
patient industry of Mr. Francis A.
Jones, whose volume, "Famous Hymns
and Their Authors," has just been pub
lished by Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton.
It is full of, curious and interesting in
formation. Take the Christmas-hymns,
for example. "Hark, the Herald An
gels Sing!" when originally published
by Charles Wesley in 1739 began
"Hark, how all the welkin rings."
"Christians, Awake!" was composed
by John Byrom In 1745 as a carol for
his little daughter Dolly, "for her and
for no one else." In the original the
manuscript Is headed "Christmas Day
For Dolly." It was first published in
1746 in Harrop's Manchester Mercury
and was set to music by the organist of
the Manchester parish church, John
Wainwright. "While Shepherds Watch
ed," another carol, was written by
Nahum Tate 200 years ago. The pop
ular "Abide With Me" was written by
the Rev. H. E. Lyte in 1847 at Brix
ham. He had become so ill that he
was ordered to Nice. On the Sunday
evening prior to his leaving he walked
by the seashore alone for half an hour
after service, fully convinced that he
had spoken to his congregation for the
last time. When the sun had set, he
went back to his study, and an hour
later the hymn was finished. Dr. Monk
composed its beautiful setting in an in
spired ten minutes.
Canon Ellerton's popular "Saviour,
again to thy dear name," was com
posed so recently as 1886, but has since
then been translated into nearly every
language and dialect. The story of
how Newman wrote "Lead, Kindly
Light," in an orange boat while be
calmed In the strait of Bonifaclo is well
known. "Rock of Ages," probably the
most popular hymn in the English lan
guage, was written by Toplady when
caught in a thunderstorml near Blag
don in the Mendips. As the London
went down in the bay of Biscay in
1866 the doomed passengers- sang this
hymn. It was once translated into
Hindoostanee by an enthusiastic native
convert, and his rendering, literally
translated, read thus:
Very old stone, split for my benefit,
Let Ine absent myself under one of your
fragments.
Many stories are told of the hymns
of Isaac Watts. It is said that he
wrote "Not All the Blood of Beasts"
after a visit to Smithfield market, while
the charming hymn "There Is a Land
of Pure Delight" was suggested by the
view of Southampton water as seen
from the Isle of Wight. He is believed
to have written 500 hymns. Many are
mediocre; a few will last as long as
the English language. "Jesus, Lover
of My Soul," was suggested to Charles
Wesley by at sea bird flying to him for
protection during a storm. It was one
of the earliest that he wrote. A good
story is told of Keble and Dr. Neale,
bouth writers, of hymns.
Dr. Neale was Invited by Mr. Keble
and the bishop of Salisbury to assist
them with their new hymnas; and for
this purpose he paid a visit to Hinsley
parsonage. On one occasion Mr. Keble,
having to go to another room to find
aMe papers, was detained a short
timse. On his return " Dr. Neale said,
"Why, Kebel. I thought you told me
that the 'Christian ear' was entirely
oelginall" "Yes," be answered, "it cer
tainly is." "Then how comes this?"
And Dr. Neale placed before him the
Latin of one of Keble'a hymns. Keble
professed himself utterly confounded.
He protested that he had never seen C
the originaL After a few minutes of
pilet eitto-ment Neale relieved him by
twnisg that he had Just turned it into

When Patti Says Farewell.
In connection with the report that
Mme. Patti contemplates one more
American tour next summer this story
is told: Baron Cedaretrom, the diva's
youthful husband, called on an Amer.
lean manager in London some months
ago and said he thought it would be a
good Idea for Patti to tour the country
in concert, adding that it might be an
nounced as her farewell appearance.
The manager gazed mildly at the
young man and seemed making a men
tal calculation. Then he said: "I was
going to say that your wife must have
made her last farewell tour of the
United States before you were born.
