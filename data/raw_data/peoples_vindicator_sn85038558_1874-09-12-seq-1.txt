attempted to be assassinate by two
notorious and desperate negroes near
Brownsville, in the lower edge of the
paallh--4e, having been. fired at by
them with double-barreled shot guns.
On last Tltprsday night, a small party
of white men went to.the cabins of
these negroes with the view of ar
resting : and lodging them. in jail,
when.thfy,were fireed upon, froan the

for this'cit@k' Not long afterwards a
party of between forty and fifty men,
supposed to be all Texans, who had
comeainto Conshatta, started in pur
suit with the avowed- purpose of
lynching tire prisoners. Later in the
day Mr. Carr iv:s apprised of this
fact, and plIt his horses and those of
the prisoVers to the top of their speed
to avoid being overtaken. While
nearing the Hultchison plantation on
lied river some thirty miles below

to prevent further pursuit, lhe was

PI'EACI ON ,PI r.--The question
has been agitated whether the ,peach
is mad",llalrdier when grafted or bud
ded on plurm stocks. The 'duity change
effected in- the peach is to slightly
dwarf its habit, and like a dry anud
poor soil, to nasse it to ripen its wood
earlier in artuan., It may therefote
render it somewbat bettei adapted to
withstand intense cold when the tree
itself, or the young shoots are killed.
The great difficulty, however, with
the peach is tnotin the killing of the
tree but of the fruit- buds in winter.
We have never been able to discover,
after much eamination, that the
maturity of-the wood had anythind4
whatever to:do with the Iirdiness of
the fruit Judis, It may therefore hI
set down .that workiug the. apeneh on
