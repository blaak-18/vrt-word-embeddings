HAVE YOU NOTICED IT?
You have noticed how different
people shake hands, haven’t you?
One fellow will grasp your hand,
and make you wish he hadn’t.
Another will lay his hand in yours
as if it were a cold fish or a ham.
There is no more worth to it than
there is to a clam.
As they shake you size them up
for their sincerity and various other
traits of character.
The preacher who stands at the
church door, after the service, and
shakes hands with the members of
the congregation as they pass out,
soon has every single member of the
flock, and strangers, sized up. He
knows handshakes, and can tell you
just which people resemble one an
other in their method of attack for a
shake.
Disappointments
One of the greatest disappoint
ments to a person is to hear a speak
er of renown, who is known as a
Christian leader, and get all full of
enthusiasm over his speech, only to
shake hands with him after, and have
him lay his hand against yours as if
to say, “I don’t know what it is all
about, but here is my hand, and it
might as well be a false one, as a
thing of flesh and blood. No life to
it, no grasp to it. Disappointing in
the extreme.”
Watch This
When a man unconsciously, and
without purpose in mind of twisting
your hand for fun, or without design,
takes your hand for a shake, and
turns the bgck of your hand down
ward, that man thinks himself to be
your superior. The man who re
verses this action, and raises the
back of your hand, thinks you his
superior. The man who places his
hand in yours and grasps it, holding
the backs and palms of yours and his
own perpendicular thinks you his
equal.
Handshaking in Klandom
Outside of the church there is no
place where handshaking is more
generally observed, or where it is
more sincerely indulged in. The
Klansman naturally feels kindly
toward his brother Klansmen. Are
they not brothers in Christ; are they
TEACHERS’ POOR PAY BLAMED FOR BAD
CONDITIONS
Sante Fe, N. Mex.—The United
•States census of 1920 states that
approximately 10,000,000 children
live in rural communities, 9,000,000,
of whom are enrolled in the
schools, with an average daily at
tendance of 7,000,000. Commenting
on the rural school situation in the
country the Scottish Rite Bulletin,
published here, says:
“While the large cities have been
voting large bond issues to provide
school sites, buildings, and equip
ment and approving greatly increas
ed tax levies for the development of
their school systems, the small schools
in rural districts, in most instances,
have languished.
“As a symbol the little red school
house is sublime, as an actuality it
leaves much to be desired. There are
190,000 one-room schools of the
country. In these schools are enroll
ed approximately 4,000,000 children.
“John J. Tigert, United States Com
missioner of Education, says: ‘The
average city school is open 182 days
in the year, the average rural school
is open 142 days in the year.’
Inefficient Teachers
“Perhaps one of the most serious
phases of the country school prob
lems is the inadequate preparation of
the teachers. The good intentions
and the public spirit of these teach
ers are beyond question, but it is a
deplorable fact that these young peo
ple are without proper training. In
New York state, out of a total of
8,400 teachers in one-teacher schools,
not more than 420 have had the
RUM RUNNERS RUSY
AS POLICE QUARREL

—K-K-K
KEANSBURG, N. J.—While the
town is all heated up over the police
war, the rum runners are having a
busy week landing valuable liquor.
Nobody seems to care, as they work
ed unmolested, taking their time.
The police fight started over the
dismissal of Charles Wilson by Chief
Shears. Wilson refuses to turn over
his badge and defies anyone to take
it away from him. The chief is back
ed up by the town council asserting
that the administration, headed' by
Mayor Thomas J. Gilmour, shall gov
ern the town.
Tales of graft continue to flow in
regard to the political situation. Dia
mond' smuggling, dope smuggling,
rum running, all have their share in
the gossip of the day. One minister
has applied for a transfer to another
chnrch because he believes that
Keansburg is not a fit place in which
to rear children. To the general at
titude and beliefs of the community
is added the fact that there are fifty
seven applicants for three vacancies
on the police force. Each pays sllO
a' month for a Job that is filled with
pany dangers.
not attempting to emulate the exam
ple of Christ the great Criterion?
Does not a sincere handshake mean
that each shall stand by the other,
and that altogether they will stand
by the downtrodden, even as their
Criterion and Elder Brother has
shown them they must do? Does
not the world need a champion for
its wrongs, and does not the hand
shake bind brother to brother in de
fense of the right?
Sons of Benjamin
It is said of Benjamin, his mother,
who died at his birth called him
Ben-Oni, but his father called him
Benjamin, “Son of my right hand.”
Of the sons of Benjamin, it appears
that they were like their father, left
handed men, who could at a hundred
paces throw a stone from a sling, and
with it hit a mark the width of a
needle.
As the “Son of my right hand,” he
is a type of Christ our Great Crite
rion, and as a son of a tribe of left
handed sure-shot warriors, he is a
forerunner of men whose thoughts
all crystallize in one thing, the de
sire to right the wrongs of the world,
thus making them warriors; and who
will train their hands to be cunning
in hitting the mark of unrighteous
ness, by using against it the things
of righteousness.
So then Klansmen place great
stress on the handshake. It must
carry with it the sincerity of the
heart, with the intelligence of the
head. It must be warm and cordial,
without guile or malice. Among
Klansmen there is a keener and finer
understanding—for each calls the
other his equal in all points—and
each is willing to immerse self in the
work of making the other and the
whole body better and more efficient
and dutiful. When Klansman grasps
the hand of Klansman, the thought is
for my brother, my Klan, my home
and my country, in the name of the
Klanman’s Criterion, Jesus Christ,
through the mercy of God, who makes
it all possible.
• “If you haven’t noticed the good
will, and the loving service promised
in the handshake in your Klans, get
your Klan right.”

“The apathy and indifference of
the rural populations constituted a
very great difficulty to be met and
overcome by educators who were
seeking to correct the deficiencies of
Country district education. Appar
ently there was an entire failure to
appreciate the need of properly equip
ped schools. It is gratifying to
know that in recent years the farmers
of the nation are coming to realize
that the uneducated and poorly edu
cated child suffers a serious handi
cap, and there is a nation-wide awak
ening to the unique advantages of

“This revival of interest is seen in a

The salaries of country teachers have
been an open scandal. The last place
for perundiousness is in that depart

on which the whole future of civil

PRO-ALIENS SHOW CON6ERN| OVER TREND OF
NEWS WRITERS
WASHINGTON, D. C.—Consterna
tion has seized those who are fighting
to keep American gates open to the
flood of immigrants and with the
leading publications of the oountry
taking up the fight on unrestricted
immigration and which was started
by the Ku Klux Klan, there is much
hurrying and scurrying among the
pro-alien interests.
In the World’s Work for January,
in an article entitled the “Immigra
tion Peril,” it is pointed out that it
taxes only a sixty months’ residence
in this country for “an Anatolian
shepherd or a Russian mujik to be
entitled to sit in judgement as a
‘peer’ in an American court.”
Magazines and newspapers are
each daily bringing forth new and
vital reasons why the gates of the
United States should be closed
against the great influx of foreigners
who do not only bring themselves
to America but bring their theories
along with them. The pro-alien in
terests are now realizing more than
ever that the battle started by the
Ku Klux Klan, to keep America clear
of European ideals and practices, is
one that can not be stopped.
Thousands of Alien Lawyers
In citing the fact that out of more
than eleven thousand lawyers in
New York City, more than 50 per
cent are of foreign birth, or foreign
parentage, the writer in the World's
Work says:
“Not so long ago, Elihu Root,
speaking before the American Bar
Association, dwelt on the many and
complex Questions of vital interest
before the conutry, such as the ef
fects of taxation, the social struc
ture, justice to the poor, and injus
tice to the rich. He hoped that those
and divers other important questions
would be solved by the ‘application
to the new conditions of the old prin
ciples of justice out of which grew
our institutions.’ But to do this, he
observed, we must have men who
‘understand thona ur incudes. their
history, their reason, their spirit,
their capacity for extension, and
their right application.’ .In other
words, we must have a Bench and
Bar of the highest intellectual and
moral integrity, deeply - versed—
steped one might say—in the learn
ing and the spirit of our laws and of
our jurisprudence. Yet, as he
pointed out, a very large part of our
new accessions to our legal profes
sion, particularly in the large cities,
are of young men who have come
from the countries of eastern Eu
rope, from countries where there
was a highly developed jurisprudence,
and having necessarily, by inherit
ance, all those predilections and fund
amental ideas which differentiate the
Continental systems of jurisprudence
from the Anglo-American system.
* * * These young men come here
—and they are coming to our bar by
the tens of thousands—with contin
ental ideas bora in them. No cram
ming for an examination will get
them out. They are not to be learn
ed or dislearned out of a book. Those
ideas can be modified or adapted to
our ideas only by contact with life —
contact with American life—taking
in, in the processes of life, some con
ception of what the American thought
and feeling and underlying basis of
honesty and justice are.

ALIEN HURLS COAL
FREESOIL, Mich.—An attempt to
start a riot and cause serious person
al injury to many Americans came to
pass last Wednesday evening when a
large hunk of - coal was thrown
through a plate glass window where
a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan was
being held.
The coal was thrown by a member
of the organized opposition to all
things American, but the name of
the miscreant could not be learned.
A number of women and children
narrowly escaped injury from the
flying glass of three window panes
that were demolished.
It was reported that the piece of
coal thrown, weighed about ten
pounds. This was doubted by some
as it was said that a ten pound ob
ject would be difficult to hurl with
such force as was the missile pro
jected from the alien hand.
An eminent scientist once said,
however, that a man’s trength all

FIERY CROSS OF KU KLUX
EMBLEM BLAZES FORTH
Eau Claire, Wis.—Hundreds were
startled to see a blazing cross some
30 feet high on the bluff south of Al

At first it was supposed to be an
ordinary fire, but the sight of fig
ures moving in the radiance and the
peculiar shape of the fiery object led
to the conclusion that it was the
typical Tallying symbol of a local
Ku Klux Klan. The cross was erect

tower and was first noticed to be afire

ed in New Jersey, translated as fol
lows: ‘We pride ourselves on having
a Polish judge here, and a Polish clerk
there,’ followed by an appeal for the
Polish voters to ‘stand together* if
they want more offices. Contrast the
warning spoken before the highest
national assembly of American
lawyers with the situation in some of
our largest cities and states where
many of the magistrates in our low
er courts and not a few of the judges
in our higher tribunals are either
foreign bora or of foreign extraction.
Contrast it with the fact that in the
richest and busiest metropolis of the
United States of some eleven thous
and lawyers, more than 50 per cent
are of foreign birth or of foreign par
entage.
“No less a careful and judicial body
than the Committee on Legal Edu
cation of the Association of the Bar
of the city of New York, under the
chairmanship of the dean of the Co
lumbia Law School, has gone on re
cord with this finding which I have
emphasized in part: ‘Many of these
men come to the bar with little know
ledge of American institutions and
with little or no appreciation of those
ideals and traditions which have in
the past dominated the spirit of our
Anglo-American legal system * *
*. The result is that the bar is car
rying an almost insupportable bur
den of a large membership unfitted
by education or experience to bear its
responsibilities and without the incli
nation which comes .naturally .from
familiarity with our institutions, to
maintain its traditions. * *
Jury Box Important
“But what shall we say of that
other burden of alienage upon our
legal system—the burden of mental
and moral alienage upon the system
of trial by jury? let us bear in mind
that the ultimate enf or cement of the
law rests upon the jury box; that
under the constitution of every state
in the Union, no member of the state
can be deprived of any of the rights
or privileges secured to citizens ‘un
less by the law of the land, or the
judgment of hia peers.’ It is a seri
ous problem enough when the ‘law
of the land’ is becoming subject
more and more to ‘interpretations’ by
lawyers and judges culturally alien
to our juridic life and traditions; but
a subtler danger is developing
through the cultural alienage of vast
masses of foreign born or foreign
minded ‘peers’ who today sit in
judgment in the jury boxes of Amer
ican courts. It takes only sixty
months’ residence in this country
(and that residence may be in the
non-American environment of a for
eign “colony” in our midst)’ and the
most simple of tests in the veneer of
‘Americanization ’to make an Ana
tolian shepherd or a Russian mujik
entitled to sit in judgment as a ‘peer’
in an American court. It is enough
to state it to show not merely the
absurdity but the grave danger of
such a free and easy system. And
those well-intentioned, but thought
less, Americans who are so anxious
to ‘naturalize’ the newcomers as
quickly and in as great numbers as
