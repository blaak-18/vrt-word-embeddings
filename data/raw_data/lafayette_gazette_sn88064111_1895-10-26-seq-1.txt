FROM COO ROCK.
BY 31 AY D. IIATCH.I
it was' vkftotisly desighated the
"T'urtle back," the "Turtledove," and
sometimes merely the "'Dove." The old
salts of the island knew it taily as tha
Turtlebtckt rock, named for its decided
resemblance to the shining browni shell
of a monster tortoise protruding from
the water; but nl acco :nt of its charm
ing cecurity for a tete-a-tete and for
the appreciation it met with from those
who were strong enough swimmers to
enjoy its advantages the name whicb
had been given to it for its crustacean
lii~oncss was usually perverted into the
simple, mnelodious appellation: "Coo
rock." Indeed, so general had this
term become that even the Venerable
go"i'sts of the Shlawkemo house, dis
cussing the tide which covered it pretty
well at the full, would call it so in all
seriousness, possibly confusing it, men
tally spelled with a K, with the various
Indian names with which the island
abounded, or believing it had refer
once, spelled with a C. to the gentle
lapping of the waves about it.
It was Monday morning. Most of
the men who had come to spend Sun
day on the island had returned to
town, three hours distant by rail; and,
although the day was exquisitely clear
and beautiful and the bay rejoiced in a
thousand shifting blues in the sun
shine, the bathers were few-a half
dozen boys at the school age turning
iback-somersaults off the float, some
children paddling around in the wet
sand with their clothes tucked up be
hind out of the wet like cock feathers,
and a staid matron or two near shore,
mildly bobbing up and down incased
in flannel and bathers' hats.
As Marie Trask walked down the
fltoat for her morninag plunge she
nodded to the boys, looked out over
the water, and sat down a moment on
tile edge to try its temperature. She
fe.lt a little lonely, a little depressed;
she swung her feet-irreproachable in
size in shape, and in black silk stock
ings-lazily in the water, and medi
tated.
She wvas a comely object for the wa
ter to reflect; a trim, svelte, girlish
figjure in a well-fitt.ing black bathing
suit, her blonde skin browned by the
outdoor life she was leading, her eyes
clear gray, a small nose which had a
tendency to be Roman, a sweet. happy
mouth that. was quick to smile and
show the white teeth that hail not yet
lost their baby unevenness at the
edges, and. crowning all, her sunny
blonde hair; not so much of it, but it
:'rinkledl and rippled over her head in
ilch a fashion that no one came near
h:.ur but wanted tolay a Ihand on it and
mi,,oth it down a bit, just to feel how
.•ft and silky it was.
l he looked over toward the rock; it
wa-s iquite a distance out in the little
harbor, and the tide ran rapidly there
at the turn. It was about full now,
lbut it would be slack water for some
time yet, and she thought she would
try it. l.te had beqn out there often,
but never alone. She was a strong
swimmer for a girl. and destitute of
fear; but always before to-day there
had been someone to go with her.
She slipped off the float; the water
was perfectly clear and just cooler
than the air. With strong, quiet
strokes she started for the rock as a
goal; half-way out sie grew a little
tired, floated a few Ininutes to rest,
and then swainm on. It seemed much
further than usual; but always before
•ho had been diverted on the way with
manly covcrsee, or given a friendly
hand if sihe were tired. At last she
reached it, pulledherself eagerly up to
the highest bulging point of the rock.
and gave a sigh of satisfaction. She
turned her back to the shore and
looked out at the hill-clasped harbor.
What a perfect day it eras! She was
irritated with herself for being blue,
but how could she help it when other
people made idiots of themselves?
Vhlat a stupid thing for her not to
have looked through thile book, any
\vay, before she had lent it to him; but
atleast she had discovered in time
what a jealous, doubting friend she
had almost consented to marry. She
remembered every word of the letter
she hIad found waiting for her that
morning. It ran:
"DEAr lIaRIE: When you loaned me Dob
son's poems last night,. I do not think you
knew you had ltft the inclosed verses in the

Certlinly he should not. Marlo thoucghtl., but

Jarck Edgerton, and that he must have written
them to you when you left the Edgerton Oamp

were called:
"So mlnv eyes meet mine each day

I think of you who hare go:ne a Way.
"I long so to look in youir eyes, dear.

A. I draw you so near.-so near.
She had never known Jack could
msake it i'hymno till these verses had
come to her. L)ear; honest dacki !ho
sorry hld would be if he know all the
trouble he had brought aborit. No;
site could scarcely hold him resionsi=
'Oe for her present discomfort-it was
all her own carelessness; and the next
time she indulged in the exchange of
literatris:e she would shake the volume
to its foundations to exoreisd all !iftle'
ing imps that might do her ill: One is
so apt to tuck things away in a book
and then forget all about tlent: Yeti
after all, he might have given Ihf
chance to explain.
She vas aroused from her reverie
by the soft rush of waters parted by
the even stroke of strong iitrhii: M.a~ri
turned her head shoreward; a man *as
rapidly swimming toward her. The
heed looked tefy familiar; but lie hitd
written her he was going on the eight
ten. A few more strokes and there
was no doubt of his identity; she
turned her gaze iigaiii boit to sea. He
clambered up on the rock beside hei:
He was a superb creature, with limbs
bronom and shinintg as one of berome's
Arabs. lie looked like some radiant
river god with a dash of water on his
chestnut hair, his eyes as blue as the
niording sea, and with that beauty in
his face that dornes from conlsciotls
strength and kindliness and the glory
of youth and Vigorous, overfloding life;
"Good-morning, Marie."
She had not yet looked at him, but
she met his gaze now with a half smile.
"I thought you were going on the
eight ten."
':I started," he answered, "cifossed
the ferry, went to the station; and
came back. TWhy did you come out
here alone? You should have known
better, the tide is reitning moit now,
and the swim back will be a hard pull
all the way."
"I am quite capable of taking care
of myself," she answered, somewhat
stiffly. "and if you are afraid of the
tide you would better go in at once."
Ile wag astonished to find her adopt=
ing an injured tone; if anyone had a
right to be hurt, he surely was the one
to enjoy the privilege of that position.
He looked at her despairingly; the lit
tie curls, dried b3 the sun and wind.
beckoned maddingly. lie forgot his
grievance for a moment.
"When Venus came ashore on the
waves," lie said, keeping his eyes on
the curls, "Zephyrus blew her theore,
and before he left her he hovered about
and kissed her until her hair, which
the sea had wet. was dry and shining
like silk; but it always kept the crinkle
the motion of the waves had given it,
and all true daughters of Venus have
inherited that ripple of the waves ever
since. That is the story [ always think
of," lie finished, seeking now her clear
gray eyes, "when I see your hair in the
sun. Marie.'
She langho:l gayly. "It seems to me
some one else i. dipping into poetry
besides poor Jack."
Ills brow darkened. "Don't make a
joke of it," he said; "the blood has
been boiling in my veins ever since I
read it. I don't blame Jack for loving
you, nor for wr'iting it to you. I ought
not to have read it; but the thought of
his having his arm about you, as it
clearly implies, and that you have
cared for him, perhaps care for him
still, has driven inc almost beside my
self. If you have any pity for inc tell
me the truth, or let me go."
".You may go," she spoke coldly; "I
will not keep you."
"See; we are here.'' he said, "ulider
the free sky. with the pure clear water,
all about us, close to honest nature,
and life would be so good to me if-is
there alwvays to be an if?-if only I
knew the truth and that it is not what
I thought-that you do not care for
hini."
"I ant very fond indeed of .lack; and
as for the verses, I think they are
clharming, and that any girl should be
happy to inspire a man like that."
D)arrell groaned. "You are more
frivolous than I believed, and you have
not been true to either of us."
"I think I will swim in," she said.
She slipped off the rock and struck out
for the shore. lie followed her silent
ly, keeping his eyes upon her, for the
tide was making hard out to sea.
"Don't try and buck against the
tide," he called; "let it carry you
down. TJust swim for the shore: you
waste your strength that way." lie
was swimming close beside her now.
"If I needed it." she asked. "would
you be strong enough to tow me in?"
lie laughed grimly. "Try me," he
answered.
lhe took both her hands in his, swim
ming easily on his back; to this hlealthy
young giant her added weight was
nothing. They went rushing through
the water at 'what seemed a terrifi~e
rate of speed to the girl whose endur
ancc had already been taxed by the
swimming, and the sense of security
and strength it gave her was a deli
cious relief.
At last they reached the float; the
little boys were tearing up and down
the sand doing jumping "stents."' She
let go of his hands and hlie lifted her
easily to the float. She was quite pale;
perhaps there hlad been some nervous
strain in her unusual exhaustion.
"Don't you feel well?" he asked, as
he stood be.idc her, taking long, deep
breaths after his exertion.
She put out a small, wet hand to
him which hlie gladly took in his own
damp grasp. "I ahould never have
gotten in alone." she said, catching her
breath a little, "so I cannot.be horrid
to you any more. That book belonged
to my Cousin Mollie. but she does not
want to announce her engagement to
Jalck till the fall."-l)emorest's MIaga

A handsome young woman with a
be.utiful I ittle girl of four years sat in
a crowded Market street car.
"'You've got on mamnma's dress,
haven't you, Aunt Alice?" remarked
the child.
Aunt Alice flushed and called atten

"Yes. the last time mamma wore that

'"Yes. if you'll be good."

"There, be a good girl. See that
woman out there with a little girl."
There was a period of silence and
Aunt Alice breathed a sigh of relief.
'lThen the child inquired:
"'l)id mamma say you could wvear her
