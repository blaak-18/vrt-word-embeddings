Our Commissioners.
The oficers appointed on our side
for the purpose of conducting the
election next Tuesday should first ac
quaint themselves perfectly with the
law and then determine to do their
duty, their whole duty and nothing
less. They should take a copy of the
instruetions home with them and
study all of its parts until they ate
perfectly familiar with all the details,
it is then and only then, that they
can feel assured in the steps they
take. Ignorant of the law they may
listen to, the advice may some times
be preiudicial to our best interests :
but if they ate well instructed no one
can mislead them. Heretofore com
missioners have in the distant wards
committed grave errors simply fromn
the fact that they were unacquainted
with the law governing their acts, but
this time wew hope no such mistakes
will be found.
No fears ot low water at McCook
& Bro., during the fall season, for
their stock is ample to supply the
wants of the people as long as they
favor themi with their calls. The
stock on haud is complete in every
particular. Give themn a call if you

IRadic:lwrm Crushed-Democra
cy Triumphant.
As W 'ide lanmplton, of South ('aro
liun, in his recent addrless to the as- 1
senibled citizens of Pockv ille, on the
12th (October, so we, the Vindicator,
to oIir i plitical anit:agonists, and to
thlie wld "Yes., you might as well
bid the Suin stand still in its course,
or try to stop the Atlantic from rising
on Sillivan's Island, as to try to stein
the tide that is rolling us on to victo
ry oil the 7th November, 1r76i. We
will tighlt the libattlo under the Coni
stitution, and if Iineed he in the
('Conrts. We will see that the rights
of every citizen are Irotected, with
out distilction of race or color, wheth
er he lie for us, or agaiinst us. No
riot ; no plrovocation to riot, or to
blooidshed. This canimpaign will and
iiust lie carried on to its close peacea
bly, if we can, and as far as in Ius
lies. To etlect and insure this end,
our organizaition is all that can be
Ie, ired; and when the Sun of the
hIi November gilds the horizon, the
flag of freedom, our National flag
and that of our beloved Louisiana,
the Stars and Stripes, and the Pelican
shall be seen unfurled, tloatilng to the
breeze, anlr waving over hill and
dale, in e very city, town, village and
hamilet, from the Gulf that washes
our Soiuthern shore, to the far lNolth
erni British Possessions, and from the
wild Atlantic onl the East, to the wile
waters of the great Pacific on the
West. Then anthems of praise annd
tlhankisgiving, will ascend like sweet
iincense front the millions of our land ;
fioin fatihers, nlothers, sons, and
dlaughlters, white and "olored,.to Hillt
who has vouchsafed to deliver us
froml the tyrannous grasp of a mnerci
less foe. '"As for me," said the pa
triotic lHentry ; "Give mie liberty, or
give mle death." Yes, the time is
come ; the day ; the hour, which will
fix our dlestiny for weal or woe.
C'onme then, fellow citizens, one and
all to the rescue; come to the front
take your position in ;line, and let us
tmarch on together to certain victory-
the day is outs. For eight long years
we have felt the lash of the oppress
or; we have been taxed until there
is about nothing more in our hands
to lie taxed-robbed, plundered, spoil
ed, and under a government claiming
to be Republiclon-Yes, it is the Re
public, the ('ormm nonwealth ofa Croni
well, withi his Roundheads, his praise
God-harelones, and his lpuritanic
crew : it is the government of the
thirty Spartan tyrants that ruled over
conqluited Athens ; eiualllling the
Neroes and Caligulas of Rome-and
this in thle 19th ceniitury--the boasted
era of civilization, enlightenment and
of civil and religious liberty. We
had hioped, for "''lope springs eternal
in lhe hliiiman breast ;" we had hoped
thalt a better seinse of justice woullh
prevail. We hlopcd, hoped on, hoped
ev.r--uit hoped in vain. At leingth
the day, the hour is near where uin
der tIhe ;Egis of our Constitution, our
fellow-citizen nwill have, and we trnst
will exercise their Constittionhal lire
roga:tive to hurl these lirould tsur
pers froml their seats of power, no
niore to disgrace the high positions in
which they havre been placed--pecu
;lators, thieves, robbers-enriching
theiiselves, but inmpoverishiitg the
nlation. Thiuk of it, fellow-citizens
--Giranlt and his 80,001) minions filling
every otfcial position, at home,
abrond, in the army, in the navy, in
the Treasury, The country has been
made to bleed at every poro--Vul
tures, eormoranllts, Iharpies are they
all; leeches suclking the lifo blood of
our country. To such a deg;ee of
inant1 and corrulnption has our boast
ed Relpublic fallen headlong, that it
- hIas become a hiss and a bye-word
among tihe civilized nations of the
. world. They stand to.day, Grant
and his mniyridons, exposed ill their
nakedness, a spectacle of foul cor
rulption, loathing to thie sight. The
e worhld ttus away from beholing it.
e Corninled such a Govrnluent to any
other people under tlhe Sun, tlhey
would spurn at it, reject the proffered
boon with loathiing, disgust and ab
horernce. BUnt their fate is seanled;
tllheir dlay of power, peculathion, rob
bery and corruption soonii will set for
ever. "Renleniber the ides of March,"
isaid the prophetic SeCer to Julius
e Casar; Remeinber the 7th ot Novem
hIer, say we. Ye Grants, ye lIilkalps,
ye Blaines, MIorlon, Garifieldls; ye

Sye Bredas, ye Blnutis, Myers, Raby.
V'anDlosen, Lewis, "el id qenus omm,,"
Sand ye others of tliut ilk, alt; vile
train. Thliink, oil think of it ! the
,. proud, the intelligent, high-luini ded,
talent, and mnoiril worth of Natcliio
Sches pa lish, ruled over alnd Iinilpled
undler foot by sulch contcrlptiole spec
imneis of the huiniai race. What has
thie ohylporitical Gospel preacher
Blunts, answered to the public charge
Is of his adulterous life-what has been
SLewis' answer to his outraged father
1 in-law. Tailk of ostracismn; such men
have ostracised themselves. Apart
, from their piolitical enmity and hos
tility to thie people among whom they
live, anld are suffered to live-they
k have been long since ostracised.
r Come out fromnt among them ye, our
c colored fellow-citizens; come, go
y with us, "for the Lord has spoken
C good commading Isinel." They have
Y deceived you, lo, these long years
II look at the Freedman's Bureau, with
its $t:i,0)00,00 the hard ealtnrhl and
the honest fruits of your toil that had
been speciously, but delusively held
out to you as a fitrnl, bearing interest,
as a re,,ort in the day of need for you,t
your children and your posterity ; all
gone into the pockets of your deceiv- t
ers-think of the ^,t0,000 tax money
of the parish of Natchitoches, for the
eitmbezzlement of which the elder
Boulit was indicted by your Grand
Jury, and whom after a patient hear
ing of days, nay weeks, a special Jury
was called, not a white rman on the
roll, condemned in a verdict of ~ t),
1OO--where is this vast sum of money
that had been collected to pay your
parish indebetdness and liabilities ?
All gone-where is your School mon
ey designed by our laws for the edu
cation of your children ? Let Myers,
Bl3unt and Lewis answer-they know.
Come out from among them--they
have long deceived you; lo, these
eight, ten or twelve years they have
deceived you, robbed you: us, they
have rlobbed i:s commron ni ih yon,
but deceived, never. Come then
with us; our interests are yours,
yours are ours. If we Iprosper, you
also prosper; if we go down, you al
so go down, and that beyond redemrp
tion. Be wise ther efore, and beware.
fIe that is not for us, is against us.
We extend to you the right hand of
fellowship-should you madly refuse,
bear in mind that we who have so
manfully borne up under the weight
and malfeasances of a corrupt, heart
less administration so long, have de
termined as one man, that the pres
ent state of things shall cormie to an
end. We will have railroads, we will
have them-a tide of immigration
will set in, and we shall have an in
dnstrious people to help us till those
fertile fields-the richest and most
productive soil on this, our terrestrial
ball ; a land of Citrons and Olives, of
melons and pomegranates, of corn,
cotton, and of every product neea
ry, healthful and useful to the raits
and the desires of mankind. We of
fier to share its adv~ ntages with you.
The land is ours-the labor yours as
well as ours; the profits and pro
ducts we shall share in just scales.
You shall have homes for your fami
lies-every thing around you to con
tribute to your comlfort and that of
your families - your sick and distress
ed shall meet with christian sympa
thy.
Comeo then-your wives, your chil
dren cry out to you, if not, their in
terests properly and wisely consider
ed cail upon you to fraternize with
us. You cannot take to your
selves wings, and fly off to some dis
tant region--shonhl yvou even do so,
that country would not be your home
Here onu have been horn, here you
have lived, here you are bound to die.
Next TI'lsday will decide your fate
whether for vweal or woe. Be wise,
therefore, and beware of the 7th of
Noverrmber. BIetter our fields should
lite waste for a year longer than bear
up a day, au hour lounger under the
hreavy lohind oif oppression and misrule
thalt has thus ground us down to al
most annriihilation. No comrpromise
-Victory or death.
\Ve mean what we Ihave said. This
contest will and must be carried out
to its close peaceably under thire con
stitution and the lains enacted for our
guidanrce and protectioa. Courage,
countrymen-Adien, an eternal adieu
to Grantism--to Kelloggism and Pack
ardism, IHuzza, and cheer for Tilden
anrd Hendricks; for Nicholls and
Wiltz. Our country, our peoplo are
again all one and indivisible. Elso
pecrpeflls. Be it so; for ever and for
ever be it so.
Call at McCook & Bro., for every
thing in the Dry Goods and Grocery

To the Polls.
On Tuesday we meet the enemy.
When that day arrives let every man
in this parish repalr to tihe polls and
there remain until the votes are i
counted. Let every white )Democrat c
pledge himself to rote one' colored p
manl on that day. l
Let no threats or attempted viol- r
ence force you to resistance. Curb
your anger and your vengeance for
one day' t
Devote Tuesday, November :th to s
Louisiana, your beloved State, and o
the centennial sun of that day will f
set upon a free and happy people.
Vote the STIFAIGIIT TICKET.
No white man worthy the name will
dare do otherwise.
You are now making history and its t
sublimest pages will record the hero
ism, the dervotionr of the sons of Loll- t
isiana. Those who hate corrupt rule ,
and labor for the Ipeople will be re t
nlilembered long after the dust of the f
disreputable mercenaries in Louisiana
has been blown to the winds of Ieav
en ! They will be heralded to the
ages s asexamples worthy of honorable
imitation, while the parasites of cor
rupt power, who bave lived without
virtue and died without repentance,
will have neither script, nor picture,
nor marble, only the universal detes
tation of mankind to embalm their
infurny. To the POLLS, country
men, and the enemy are ours.

Those who would at this late day
skulk into the Radical camp for the
hope of getting a petty little oflice,
must remember that they are attach- I
ing themselves to a sinking ship, and
they will remain hereafter as marked
men, unworthy of trust or confidence.
The hlonet people of this parish
f and State, are doing all they can to
wrest fromti the hanlds of ithe spoiler
our beloved Louisiana, and those
who to-day stand in the way of such
a movement, will hereafter be looked
upon as no better than the evil-doers
themselves. They must never hope
for sympathy or countenance from
our people again ; they have deserted
us in the hour of our nered, and they
mlust abide the consuequenrces ; if they
are so weak as to be caught by the
small bait of Police Juror, they have
no strength inl our ranks, and can
carry, no force to the Republicnns. It
is for their goodl that we pen these
words of warning, antd if they per
sist in their course, let their folly
rest oel their heads.

Independent Candidates.
We see that the C'oushatta Citi:ce
supportS Stringfellow for the Legis
lature, notwithstanding it has claim
ed heretofore to be a good Democrat
it-Conservative paper, but how it
can reconcile its acts with former
pIrofessions, is certainly a mystery
beyond the comprehension of ordina
ry Wortals. And this is not al!, for
we are informed that a prominent
S'gentleman in tile parish, who took
part in the January Convention, par
ticipated in all of its acts, sympathy
sed with all of its mnovemlents. colies
out now in support of Stringfellow.
One of the mnainl qluestions then pro
imlgated and iunanimnously endorsed,
was "TITIT TIu:REr SiOUIID BE NO
DIVI"ON Is OUR RANKS." A. II.
Leouard, from Shreveport, was the
tony man in that Cotnvention who at
tempt ited to cast a fire-brand, and lie
was utterly squelched, completely
annihilated, so to speak, so nmtch s5o
that lie pluntlg(d right into the Iltdi
cal camp, but we cannot believe our
t'tiend in Red River will follow in his
footsteps. We write this more in
sorrow than anger. Deeply regret
ting the strange rental aggravations
that should prompt such unwarranted
acts in one who has been hitherto so
steadfast in well-doing.

Day of Election.
SNext Tuesday, voters of the parish
of Natchitoches, you will be called
upon to do all you can for the good
cause of free government and Reform.
Next Tuesday will bed a mnomen
tons day for our State, for upon the
result of that day's election all fu
ture hopes of good government de
pend.
It is now plain that we cannot stand
four more years of Radical corrnp
tion and thievery here, and this is the
1 day for all to do the work of redemp
1 tion. Eight years of Radical rule
should be enough to satify any one
SIthat it is not for our good it should
o continue, for in these eight years we
r have gone from peace and plenty, to
e distress and strife.
Ii We have reached the lowest depths
d of woe, and now if every manl will
x do his duty on next Tuesday, we will
e begin a new era of good feeling
n among our peoplo which will lead us
di on to happiness and contentment.
y In order, however, to win this
y fight, every voter, old and young,
e must constitute himself a Committee
e of one, to mnarch on to victory. Let
n no one imagine that going to the hal
t lot box and depositing his ballot is
ae tll of his duty. After hlie has done
this, he is only prepared for the bet
v ter work.
Put apathetic feelings aside and go
at them with a vim; leave offdignity
for this day, and work for the suc
Scess of our ticket.
Soften starchy stiffness and go
among your friends and acquaintan
ces and show them the way to vote.
S If every one will do this on the day
d of election, our success is as certain
das any thing can possibly be.
Remember the watch-word, work
work ineessantly.
