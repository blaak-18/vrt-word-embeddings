FARMERS HERE AND THERE.
Old Uncle Hi limps out and says,
“This weather may be fine
Fer farmers’ scorn, but I’ll be derned
Es it is good fer mine!”
(Kansas City Times.
Old Uncle Hank then clumps along,
Says he “It’s good for onions,
But I kin testify, b’gosh,
It’s mighty rough on bunion’s!”
(Chicago Tribune.
Then Uncle Ezra with a twinge
Remarks that in all his
Experience he’s never seen
It worse for rheumatiz.
(Indianapolis News.
The Kansas farmer’s foot is sore,
And yet without a doubt
Bunions and corns are not to blame —
He’s suffering from the gout.
(Kansas City Star.
Out here the farmer’s feet hurt, too,
But he cares not a blank,
He’s worn the skin off packing cash —
Hard cash —down to the bank.
(Denver Post.
To hear an Oklahoma farmer talk,
There’s much to make him tame.
His corn’s a popping on the stalk —
But he’ll get there just the same.
(Oklahoma Farmer.
In Tennessee, your Uncle Tom
Has no patches on. his seat;
Says he never saw such corn grow,
Both on stalk and feet.
(The Southern Fruit Grower.
In North Carolina, your Uncle Pete
Goes limping ’round the field;
He has no corns upon his feet,
But a stone bruise on his heel.
(The Mocking-bird.
We’ve got cotton here in Georgy,
Yams and goobers —peaches, too.
We don’t want no corns in ourn;
Corn we scorn and leave to you.
SORGHUM.
The value of sorghum for forage
has only of recent years begun to be *
understood. Both as pasturage and
as hay it furnishes a very large
amount of feed, and especially for
pasturage it is not equaled by any of
the other annual forage plants in
amount of feed produced. Unfor
tunately, it cannot be planted early
and is not available for pasture until
July. However, it is in the lattei’
part of July and in August that
permanent pasture is most likely to
be poor, and a field of sorghum can
be used to great advantage to supple
ment such pasture.
The early amber variety is generally
used in the Missouri valley. For pas
turing or soiling, it is planted with a
press drill at the rate of two to two
and a half bushels to the acre, after
corn planting. It grows very slowly
at first and if put in when the weather
is cold is apt to get very weedy. For
hay, it may be seeded in the same way
or in double rows six inches apart and
thirty inches between these double
rows. It is then cultivated like corn
and harvested with a corn binder. In
regions of small rainfall this method
is particularly satisfactory.
It may be pastured when about
eighteen inches high, but for soiling
should be allowed to grow somewhat
higher, if the greatest amount of feed
is to be produced. It makes a very
rapid growth after being eaten down
or cut. Under some conditions it is
fatally injurious to stock and its use
for pasturage when injured by drouth,
or perhaps frost, cannot be said to
be safe. For soiling this objection
does not hold if it be allowed to stand
for a few hours after being cut. —

ECONOMY ON THE FARM.
The saving of many small things
will make one large one. The great
rivers are composed of many small
streams, which have trickled down
the various mountains and valleys
and emptied their contents together
into one great channel, on whose
waters our great ships of war and
commerce can trade.
It is the accumulation of small
things that counts. The saving of
small things is only adding strength
to your pocketbook and bank account,
and making you more and more day
by day able to stem the storm of
life and overcome the many obstacles
tha; we have to encounter.
Take notice of our merchants, for
instance. Their success in business
is due principally to the saving of
the many small profits. I have
actually seen them save the nails
they draw from the opening of their
goods boxes and throw them into
their nails cases to sell.
Suppose we were to make a careful
investigation of our farms, and see
how many things we have already
let waste this season, and count its
value. We would be surprised how
it would count up. This is all clear
loss out of our profits.
It is a very true saying, that we
must save our hay while the sun
shines.
The writer had six acres of coni
this year that failed to make any
thing except small nubbins, which,
with what good corn I will have,
would not run me the coming year.
Instead of letting the corn dry up
on the stalk, I went into the field
and cut it down and shocked it up
green, and it cured as nice as you
ever saw, and the :e ”!t is, I have
plenty of feed for my mules (two)
to last me till the heavy plow season,
after which my corn will run me
through the rest of the season.
Many of us have grass patches
that could be mowed and stored away
to feed the good old milch cow
through the winter, and save our
money that otherwise would have to
be used to purchase hay at a very
high price.
There are various other things
that can be saved profitably. Do
not buy anything from the merchants
that you can grow on the farm. Find
out what you will need and plant a
patch of each sufficient to supply
Jeffersonian
your needs. Don’t buy anything
unless you are in actual need of it.
It is a matter’ of poor economy for
a farmer to try to raise cotton to buy
everything he needs on the farm,
especially if he is living in a country
where he can raise all kinds of
fruits and vegetables.
When we come to the point where
we can depend on ourselves for a
living and not the merchant, we will
be the happiest and most independent
class of people on earth.
I have seen a good deal in Home
and Farm on the saving of planting
seed, so I will give my ideas on the
question, which I expect to follow in
the future.
Go through your cotton and select
the best stalks, those that are best
formed, and pick the best bolls, near
the center of the stalk. Never pick
the ends of the limbs. Have it
ginned separately, and you have a
good quality of planting seed, and
will surely have less barren stalks the
coming season.
For corn, my plan is to leave the
stalks as I pull my fodder, leaving
the fodder on them, which serves as
a mark for the seed stalks and also
fully matures the ears. ’ln selecting
we should select well matured ears
and see that there are no barren
stalks nearby or smut or any other
diseased stalks that are liable to
adulterate your seed stalk. This can
be gathered in a basket or sack as
you see fit and stored away free
from dampness. It is a very good
idea to select the best of this then
and plant a separate patch in good
soil to select your seed from again
for the next year. This will enable
us to always improve our variety of
planting seed each year. —H. W.
Young, in Home and Farm.
THOROUGH CULTIVATION MUST
PRECEDE FERTILIZATION.
The soil is made up of thousands
of little grains, and the finer these
grains are the greater the power of
the soil to hold moisture, since it
forms a film around each little in
dividual soil grain. Moreover, the
finer the soil particles, the smaller
the opening between them, and hence
the greater the power of the soil to
draw moisture from one section of
the land to another and lift it close
to the surface of the soil, where it
may be utilized by the growing crop
or permitted to escape into the air,
according to the skill and ingenuity
exercised by the farmer in the cultiva
tion of his land. Since plants can
only take their food up when dis
solved in water, the importance of
the soil being in a good physical con
dition becomes instantly apparent. It
is easy to see that a soil which is in
a lumpy, rough condition can not
absorb and hold the proportion of
water necessary to tide over drouth
periods, and to convey the plant food
which may be added to the soil in a
soluble form to the roots of growing
plants. Hence, it frequently occurs
that a large amount of fertilizer
added to a soil in bad physical con
dition is never brought in contact
with the growing roots and fails to
benefit the crop. Moreover, it was
never anticipated nor even advocated
by the strongest believer in com
mercial fertilizers that they should
supply the entire needs of the grow
ing crop. It was expected that a
portion of the plant food placed in
the soil by nature would be rendered
available from year to year through
the corroding action of plant roots,
through fermentation resulting from
the free movement of air through the
soil,, and by the dissolving action of
the water surrounding the soil parti
cles.
Land that is only cultivated three
inches deep can not absorb and hold
moisture; neither can the air readily
penetrate it to do its work in setting
free plant food. It is needless to
point out that the roots of plants
can not forage through it in every
direction to drink up the mineral
laden moisture of the soil and so
build up their tissues with rapidity.
For these reasons the mere applica
tion of commercial fertilizers with
out proper soil cultivation will never
prove a profitable practice, and ac
counts for a majority of the failures
to obtain a profitable return from the
use of fertilizers so frequently men
tioned by farmers.
This picture of the situation is not
overdrawn, yet it emphasizes very
clearly how great has been the neg
lect of putting the soil in a proper
physical condition by deep, thorough
and persistent cultivation, and yet
what a determining influence this
matter of cultivation has on crop
production and on the proper utiliza
tion of the larger or smaller stores
of commercial plant food which may
be added to the soil from time to
time. It is necessary that we add
nitrogen, phosphates and potash to
the great majority of our soils in
liberal amounts in order to gather
profitable crops therefrom, but it is
folly to depend on fertilizers to do
a work which they simply have no
ability to perform. The farmer must
understand that the direction of his
energy towards putting the land in
proper physical condition is as much
a part of successful crop production
as the mere application of commercial
Plant food.—Andrew M. Soule in Cot
ton Journal.
