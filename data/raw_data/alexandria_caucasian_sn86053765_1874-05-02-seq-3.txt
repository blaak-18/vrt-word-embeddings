The ièénHWâ Pant and
Future.
The negro has been the Central %ure in
Knrone anil AnietUm for mom tliau a quar
ter or a century. That lie should have ur
quired that importun«» i» one of the most
curions episodes in the history of mankind,
ludeed, fats whole history is a paradox. A
nation without heroism, which has never
known or eijeit |due4 for liberty, his slave
ry in America lias excited more sympathy
tint» the slavary ofCLreeco or the falLof
heroic Polau«. A mere savagA whenever
left to himself, with the lowest instincts,
whether in Africa or Sen Domingo, and
eveu in America scarcely in ore than a neriii
barbarian; without refinement and with
out genius, he has had attributed to him,
the tact, the refinement and the nspira
tion» of the highest civilization. Hyster
ical old maids and school niarms from [the
North in their sentimental moods dream
of his smiles as Don Quixote did of those
of bis Dulceuia, and insane bigots seek to
propitiate tbe wrath of Heaven by preach
ing crusades and parading their sympa
thies in his behalf. Without a will of his
own and a mere instrument in the hnmls
of others, be has nevertheless developed
■one remarkable facility, that of running
every body crazy who lias bait anything to
do witb him: Whether it Uo hiH master
at the South or his worshippers, the Abol
itionists, at the North. He lias absolutely
reversed the order of induction and fuels
are made to prove in regard to him exact
ly tbe reverse or what'they would prove if
applied to other races Domestic slavery
is made the cause of his ignorance, and his
barbarism apd his want of capacity, and
yet domestic slavery with all its odious
features was a parildise compared to his
condition in Africa. One of the oldest na
tions, Africa, is without a history, and
oven its traditions tell no story of a negro
hero. There, be is the same to day that
be was* 3000 years ago, without letters,
without, art, without science and without
a government. He was cotemporary with
Etfypt in the days or her civilization and
lier glory and yet no Cadmus was aMo to
engraft ner letters n non the sons of Africa.
He lived to see the rise and decline of the
civilisations of Palestine, of Ninevah of
ltabylon, of Greece, of Rtfine, of Arabia—
but they failed to light up for one single
moment tho darkness of li if» barbarism.
Drought to America nearly 200 years ago,
and reared iu the midst «if the dnvelope
liient of the most wonderful civilization
thé world has ever knowii^bis race is yet
without an inventor, without an author
without a philosopher ami even without
a skillful executor ot other men's ideas
But his admirers with an idolatry w hose
blindness romiuds us of that of the wor
shippers in tho Pagodas of China and Tom
pies oflndili. refuse to see in their idol
anything but the evidence of divinity ami
xti 'l) attribute bis ignorance to the effects
of slavery. They forget that Hparticns
■and Hertorins and Ksopand Terence, were
slaves in the midst of a slavery more cruel
And barbarous thau any known in oi.-c age.
They forget to compare I lie civilization of
the American negro with that of hi" an
cestor, and inquire the cause oH'ie great
change. It is trfie that the civilization of
the American negro when compared with
that of tho Anglo-Saxon, is low wideed—
but it is iiumonfiurahlo in advance of any
civilization iii Africa, and we believe in
iidvanee of that oCäan Domingo and lla.v
ti, where lie has heeu left to his own geni
us for ninety years. That one should sym
pathise with intelligence and genius and
Tedneinrnt in the tramels of slavery anil
mourn with them over their loss of liber
ty is what we flan readily comprehend —
but, we cannot appreciate the sentiment
which mourns 0 the loss of the liberty of
u people, who never were free, but taken
irom a slavery of whose cruelty and deg
nidation we have, no conception a n d
placed in one infinitely more mild and
gentle. Neither can we appointe the sin
cerely of those who believe that the Afri
can, a hideous, naked savage, ignorant of
every art lias lieuu injured and kept in ig
norance by being clothed and placed iu
the midst of civil izstion anil taught the
arts of civilized life; although his school
room was that of domestic slavery. Do
mestic Slavery had many evils and many
blessings; but as paradoxical as it may
sound, its evils were almost entirely visit,
cd upon the white man and its blessings
Upon tho negro. To him it was a par
odist«; true it was not a paradise entirely
free from evil, but still one iu which the
good preponderated so much over the evil
ns to mako its blessing to him full to over,
flowing. It can almost say to him iu the
language of scriptare"you were naked and
I clothed you, you were hungry and I fed
you, you were sick and I visited you." It
found him a naked hideons savage and if
it has not left him as civilized and 6 iiitel
ligent as hysterical old inaulso.mil corrupt
politicians claim lilm to be, it has done
more for l :im than any other system has
done for him for3000 years. It has left him
clothed and in his right mind and iipnu
the threshold of civilization. What other
school has, or could liaTé-ilono so much !
Perhaps Wendell Phillips and others would
have built hiur school-houses and sent, him
the school master and Webster's spelling
book, hut if our ancestors had made such
an attempt, history would surely write
them down as insane. We doubt "if thero
is an abolitionist in the North except Mr.
Phillips, who would bo willing to thus un
dertake the education of a cargo of these
naked children of Africa even iu the iniilst !
ot this age of primnieis and spelling books
and school masters: but we have no doubt
that there are thousands of carpet-baggers
at tho South and political demagogues at
the North who would be more thau wil
ling to undertake tho education not only
of a cargo lint of a thousand cargoes of
these naked Africans iu the science of
American statesmanship, and how to vote i
the so-called Republican ticket. I kit our,
ance sto rs thought otherwise. dVhou laud- 1

years of experiment he has made does not
promise well. So far from improving, lie
lias nearly dragged down the civilization
of tlie people among whom he lives. Iiis
influence has been evil and only evil.
He has been the in ere tool of the
vicious and depraved—and through theui
inaugurated a system of plunder and po
litical corruption Hpequaled in Klimpe. In
Louisiana he has tilled the legislature with
men from the lowest haunts of vice, among
whom theft, and bribery are no dishonor,
and the grossest igiiora®e:e no shame. The
halls of legislation he has made to rival iu
disorder anil bilingsgai,o,»tlie cockpit, and

once the regarded as the palladium of lib
erty, he has biirlesqtied into an absuidity,
mid tho ballot lu x. the fountain of pow
er, he has taken from the people and com
mitted to t he keeping of fraud and perjury.
Integrity and intelligence and honor un
der Iiis rule have been its thoroughly pre

nrNow it is! our time to "chop
logic." Tito Gazette wants to get us
into a controversy with Mr. McGim
sey, notwithstanding our remarks
of last Saturday, and taking up the
two words "forced" and "malicious"
ufjcd by us iu reply to what "that
patent, outside" and dry inside sheet
had formerly said, pwiceeds thnsly:
1. The Gazette was offended at
the use of "ifsurper."
2. The.Caucasian used the wards
'forced." and "malicious" to the Ga
zctte.
;5. Mr. MeGimsey was aggrieved
at the use of "Usurper."
4. Therefore what the Caucasian
says .about the Gazette it saya
about Mr. MeGimsey. .
And the 1 Otrisal ]fj Gazette lias
Hie elFrontry to challenge us or "any
other man" to "controvert this il he
can." All we have to say about
Mr. MeGiinsey's thanking the edi
tor of the Gazette, is that he dis
played very had judgment in rely
ing on the Gazette to <lo him jus
tice, without lirst finding out where
Kelso was and when he was com
ing home, for likivthat lîarlow Ks?
Kltix article, he might have got
"lclt out in the cohl." 8 ° *
The fallacy of the logieftl £?| argn
ment is fourni itf'the fact that wo
did not intend to offend .Mr. Mciiiiu
sey and never knew that he Was of
fended until the Ca/ette told us so,
this morning. Wo had his state
ment to tho contrary some time ago,
wherein he said that he himself had
<»n reflection not attributed any
such motives to us, and that lie
had told others of our assurance
to Ii im on tho boat coming from
New Orleans and that he was sure
we meant him no disrespect.
We presume that he was moved
to thank the Gazette for its '-equiv
ocal support" by tiyi same feelings
of "common courUxi/" that induced
our first noticf of the Gazette that
we see paraded jit the iiearl ol'^ls
leader this nio|ning, when as in our
case, it had i£i hin — volunteer* <1 its
"equivocal support." The course
generally of the Gazette is as "equiv
ocal," as its logic is always b;id.

The liiiy Straw. and Grass lie
porter lid* an article on tlie source
of Buy supply from wljick we make
the following extract :
"We will add, in regard to tho busi
ness of hay shipping in tho West, that
it is increasing iu -proportion to the
rapid growth of the cities and tho de
velopment of tho lumbering and min
ing interests along the hikes as well fts
tho increased southern, demand. To
the importance of the latter market,
however, Texas anil Tennessee seem
to have been awakened, at id uid fair
to becotnu formidahto rivals to the
West as a so ù ice of Southern supply.
With a market in .New ^rleans und
Mobile for liny, at from £25 to §40 per
ton, it indeed diflicult to understand
why Texas has so long produced noth
ing but stock, which at the age of three
or foiir 0 years, sells at the price of a
ton of hay in the same market."
The'Value of the Hay crop in this
country exceeds by far, the value
of the cotton .crop. 4' is strange
that the tanners and planters of
this parish.have so long neglected
this great source of revenue, which
has proven so profitable in other
sections, that are not-so well adapt
ed to growing hay ns this. The far
mers of the West and East grow
rich of © less fertile soils, wlii^ the
average, cotton planter in Louisi
ana looses money every year, or
just clears -expenses. There is no
section id'the Union better adopted
to hay and stock raising than this.
The ityligeiious grasses, the Bermu
da for instance, will produce from
two*to four tons of hay per acre—
worth 0 in the market from twenty
to lorty dollars per toil.
The Lucerne will easily produce
from three to five tons per acre;
Mlith the lands properly prepared
before sowing the seeds, Timothy
and Red Clover and other
' l . K li, ' , ses
will grow here, as Well asm Ken
tucky, with a little C'/vt'C—and yet,,
we have not a single farmer in thisi
whole section of the istate enga"ed
in this profitable business. We
cultivate cotton, when we know
tliat the average, cost of producing
is Irom !?.'».> to sio per bale, and the
average crop is i>ne bale to three
acres, besides a very uncertain crop
at, that. We need a new departure
iu this parish, and©the sooner it is
made by the farmers, tin© sooner
they will become independent, both
of Commission Merchants and ir
responsible negro laborers. With
the markets of Xew Orleans and
Mobile at our doors, with cheap riv
er transportation and \?ith a cli
mate and soil far superior to the
à\ est for hay and slock, we have
permitted tho West to supply this
demand.

MORTGAGE.
A mortgage is ono of tho means of
securing a debt. Only immovable pro
perty, or property immovable by des
titution is suscepiblo ot being mort
gage. A vnlid mortgage is good lor
ten years, when it inust be re-inscribed
by hfiviug tho Recorder - write it over
again in its proper {dace upon the
mortgage book of the time. The
indrtgago is generally given to secure
notes which aro paraphed Ne Varie
inr v by the jiotary to identity them
with the act, aud to show that they
aro mortgago notes. " JSe" l r #retur n
means,," let it not bo. altered." The
first mortgage spread upon the records
takes the first rank and must be paid
in perference to other mortgages that
conm after it. Any mortgago creditor
whoso debt is due, can sell the Mort
gaged property, by paying the prior
mortgages. A mortgage which imports
a confession of judgment or contains
the pact de non uliendoy not to sell, may
be enforced by executory process, with
out a regular suit, e
The mortgegés is lost by tho 'pre
scription of tho notes. À failure to
re-inscribe a mortgage within ton years
does not destroy it, provided the
notes are kept out of proscription, but
if there are other mortgages, it loses
its rank.
