AMERICAN CONSULS.,
Congressman Payee Declarse Them the
Most esicleat In the World.
New York, Dec. 26.-Oongressmau
Sereno E. Payne, chairman of the ways
and means committee, who is spending
Christmas at his home in Auburn says:
"One of the gratifying things to the
experienced observer of national affairs
is the growing efficiency of our consular
service. A few years ago the service
was rather inefficient and a consular
post was looked upon as a berth for a
politician who wanted an easy job. Of
late years all this has been changed.
"Our consuls now are probably the
most efficient in the-world. Their re
ports on conditions and manufactures
abroad are in many instances models of
comprehensive intelligence of the sort
that is needed by our manufacturtrs.
One of the best testimonials to their ex
cellence is the oritloism in the leading
countries of Europe that our oonsujs tell
too much about the secrets of foreign
manufacturers. This is particularly
true in Germany, where the German
press is quite wrought up about the
cleverness of many of our consuls in
getting hold of the Inside facts."

company as a tremendous stroke of Brit
ish enterprise. Ormap will, is declares,;

holders. This newspaper in another
column at the same time appeals to Eng
lishmen to wake up to save the threat
ened industries of the country.
The Times, dealing with the same
subject, concludes that there is urgens
need for a thorough national system of
technical and commercial education. g

DENIES THE CLAIM.
Malted States Will Not Recogetse Setls
Agalnat the Cubas. War.
Washington, Deoc. 26.-The German
embassy has laid before the state depart
ment the clains of a number of (erman
subjects for damages to their interests
In Cubaas a resultof the Spanish-Amer.
lean war, and the insurrection which
led up to the war itself. This action of
the German government has raised a
most important issue and the depart
ment 8! state has given it the olosest
consideration. It has been concluded
that the United States government can
not accept responsibility for the claims.
They are regarded as priotically the
same in principle as the claim of Porto
Rico against OCba for $2.500,000 on ac
count of a war loan. Although ip that
case Governor Allen of Puerto Rico rep
resented the United States in preferring
the claim, that government was obliged
to deny its liability, or the liability of
Ouba under present conditions. The
answer to the German presentation will
be based upon the reply to Governor
Allen, recently made.
It is known that other govern est's
besides Germany have claims aggregat
ing a very large sum, all based on the
Cuban insurrection and succeeding
events. They will not be abandoned on
account of the attitude of the United
States government, but on the contrary
will be held in abeyance until such time
as Cuba shall have become independent
when they may be presente44ireotly to
the government of the island.
