To the Land of Enchantment
By Lena Zeilman
E
AURA had a caller one after
noon. It was the day before
she started on her trip to the
land of enchantment. Some-
thing which Mrs. Melvin Reed said
made her decide quite suddenly to
take the journey. What Mrs. Reed
said was this: “Laura, you ought to
marry. It is too bad that you will
persist to waste your youth in sin
gle blessedness. I have often said
that you were missing the high mark
for which you are fitted. What a
fine wife you might make some good
fellow! What a sweet mother you
might be to little children.’’ Laura
laughed softly. “My youth is quite
gone, Nannie, for I am twenty-nine,
you know,’’ she said. “Twenty
nine, but lovely still,” said Nannie,
touching with loving fingers her
friend’s abundant brown hair.
Mrs. Reed’s words seemed to cast
a spell over Laura, for she sat a long
time in silence, gazing absently
through the open window, lost in -a
dream of the past. Into her thoughts
came the written words of a man,
whom she had never seen. He was
a Southern gentleman, and once,
when he had visited friends in the
North, had seen her photograph and
heard much praise of her. Laura
had been away from home at that
time, so failed to meet him person
ally; and shortly after his visit, his
Northern friends went abroad to
live. So the years rolled on and
they did not meet. But romance
had prompted the man to write a
letter to the fair Northern lady.
Cupid tried to pierce their hearts
with his love-darts, and several let
ters passed between the two. The
man in true, warm, Southern style
declared his love, and the girl’s
heart responded. She was about to
have him meet her in her home,
when she heard indirectly that the
man was a widower, had been mar
ried twice before. The news shocked
her exceedingly, and when he again
wrote, begging to be permitted to
the pixie-folk were going to be even
kinder than that to her, for in the
evening she saw the same man and
dog pass leisurely along the street,
as she sat on the veranda resting.
“Pray who is that splendid-looking
person?” she asked of her landlady;
and the woman answered, “That is

eyes; removing adenoid growths
that make the young creatures
suffering therefrom stupid, ugly,
“mouth - breathers”; looking after
congenital deformities, and the ills
which are the result of improper liv
ing—trying to bring out the best that
is in the individual. Caring for chil
dren is specifically the duty of the
home, but since thousands of homes
are too ignorant to do this, the
school must assume the responsibil
ity, and send the inspiration of its
suggestion and care back to the
home. The opportunity of the school
teacher for doing good is simply
boundless, and, happily, all of them
seem to be measuring right up to the
opportunity.
visit her, a revulsion of feeling had
taken her heart by storm.
In his letter he called her his
“fairy princess”, and implored, “Oh,
let me come nigh unto thee.”
But Laura took a decided step,
without due consideration. She
wrote to him without delay, refusing
his plea. “No, no; do not come to
me. You must stay in your beauti
ful Southland, the land of enchant
ment, and I must remain in the
North. Let me be truly but a dream,
a fairy princess to you, and by and
by you will forget, since dreams
are easily forgotten. So I hope the
dream of myself will soon fade from
your heart. I have no explanation
to make to you. I can only say that
I shall immediately go on a visit to
friends in a distant city, for an in
definite time. It will please me to
know that you have soon forgotten.
Please write the word ‘Kismet’ to me,
when you no longer care.” Five years
passed, but Laura had not received
the message, and Nannie’s words
brought the bitterest love-dream
back to the girl’s heart again. “The
man might be dead. Five years is a
long time to wait and still care,” she
thought. Then, as she sat gazing
absently before her, a wild desire to
go to the land of enchantment came
over her. She suddenly longed to
see the man who had withheld the
message she had waited so long to
receive. If he were alive she wished
to find him. So she resolved to go
alone into that beautiful land, to his
native city, on her strange mission.
She aroused herself from her rev
erie, to find Nannie putting on her
wraps preparatory to leaving. “I
must go now, darling,” said that
little lady, “for Ralph will be disap
pointed if he does not find me there
when he gets home from the office.”
So the two friends kissed each other
affectionately, and Laura said, “I am
going away, Nannie, and may not
see you again very soon, so take good
care of your sweet self.” “But where
are you going?” asked Nannie, in
surprise. Laura smiled. “If I tell
you, you will not understand, but I
will tell you, just the same. I am
going to the land of enchantment.”
“Are you quite crazy, at last?”
gasped Nannie. But Laura gently
pushed her out of the door.
For a time Laura’s circle of friends
were left without news of her. Only
Mrs. Melvin Reed knew of her
strange assertion about going to the
mystical land, and that lady had re
solved to say nothing, since anything
she might say regarding the matter
would surely sound absurd. Ah,
that journey! Laura would never
forget its beauty, nor its strange,
sweet influence. The train moved so
slowly southward through the bright
sunshine, and the fragrance of flow
ers and other growing things floated
in through the open windows. She
liked the lingering mode of traveling.
It was a pleasant change from the
bustle and rush of the Northern rail
roads. Mark Twain’s quaint idea
came to her, with the full force of
its drollery. How, when he once rode
on a Southern train he was so lup.

pressed with the slow movement of
things that he suggested to the con
ductor the advisability of placing
the cow-catcher on the back of the
train, lest a cow should stroll into
the car and bite a passenger. But it
was all lovely to her. The orange
and pomegranate trees were beauti
ful. The magnolia, with its many
flowers and rich glossy leaves, was
exquisite. Even the colored folks,
with their vividly gay bandannas,
made strikingly fine points in the liv
ing moving picture that spread it
self out before her all the way to
the land of enchantment.
She arrived at her destination in
the dusk of the early evening, when
the whole earth seemed steeped in a
soft but odorous languor, and the
cooing call of the wood-dove fell
like a benediction cn the hushed
evening air. The gray twilight
shadows seemed to embrace her
caressingly. The scented night
breeze fanned her cheek and ruffed
the hair on her brow. She felt as if
unseen fairies were hovering near,
and with lavish bounty were pouring
into her veins fountains of ecstasy.
“O elfin people! O lovely lotus-land!”
she sighed, “if the treasure which I
seek is here, I pray you yield it to
me.”
When the flush of a new-born day
was tinting the East with a roseate
glow, Laura arose from her bed, and
parting the curtains looked out of
the window upon the yet quiet street.
The people in this Southern city were
in no hurry to begin the business of
the day, for there was not even a
milk-cart in sight, neither an ice
wagon. The cool stillness of things
was delightful to her. The rush of
life seemed left far behind, with its
clamoring noises; and here she was
experiencing one of its pauses, and
the morning hush of nature, broken
only by the sweet songs of the birds,
was to her a boon of delight, a rav
ishing interlude of joy and rest. She
dressed herself slowly and went out
on the street. “This is his street,
as well as mine,” she said softly to
herself. “I’ll walk to his old-time
number and view the house,” and
she sauntered slowly along. The
old-time number indicated a large
white house, with wide verandas and
cool, green blinds. It sat well back
from the street, in the center of a
smoothly-clipped lawn. A man stood
on the front steps, as though about
to start out for a walk, and a beau
tiful English setter was waiting
eagerly to make the start. Laura’s
heart throbbed excitedly. “Could
that be he?” she asked herself, and
strove to give but a casual glance as
she passed by. That glance revealed
a tall man, neither old nor young,
with a smoothly-shaven face, and
hair that appeared thick and tawny
in color. She could not see his cast
of features, as he stood too far back
from the sidewalk. She retraced her
steps to her boarding-place, re
joiced at such a favorable opportuni
ty of sightseeing. “The pixies’ in
fluence is abroad in the early morn
ing, evidently,” she thought. But
