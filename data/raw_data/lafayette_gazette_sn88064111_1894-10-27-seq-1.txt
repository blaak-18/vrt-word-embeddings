IT CHANGED TWO LIVES.
A Pathetic Inpident of Gen. Bragg'
Retreat.
The 18th of December, 1868, was a
sad day to the confederate army. com
manded by Gen. Bragg, in winter quar
ters around hIalton, for on that day
thirteen men who at one time be
longed to that army had been sen
tenced to be shot.
Some had been caught by our cav
alry fighting against the armny they
had once belonged to, some had en
listed as teamsters in the federal
army, and some were to be shot for
insubordination. Among the number
was gallant little Charley Hudson, a
beardless youth, but as brave a soldier
as ever went to the front. Wherever
the bullets flew thickest Charley was
to be found, and in the charge on some
battery he always led; so it was often
said that he bore a charmed life.
His father, who lived at a small sta
tioni on the railroad, along which we
had retreated after the battle of Mis
sionary ridge, was a very old man. He
was a great union man, with no sym
pathy for the southern cause.
The subject of Charley's joining the
confederate army had often been dis
cussed. The old gentleman at first
strongly opposed it, but finally, see
ing that hie son was determined to go,
he gave his consent with one proviso:
If ten. Bragg's army retreated beyond
their home he was to return. To this
Charley acceded, never for a moment
dreaming that such a thing would
happen. But the army did leave his
home behind, and, true to the vow he
had made to his father, he returned
home.
He found that everything had been
destroyed and his people destitute; so
to help them to live he enlisted in the
federal army as a teamster, as he
thought in that capacity he would not
have to fight his old comrades.
That act changed my whole life, and
caused thorns to grow where I ex
pected the sweetest roses. I was de
tailed to command one of the squads
assigned to inflict the awful penalty
upon our former comrades-in-arms on
that fatal 18th of December. We
were ordered to be at the place of exe
cution promptly at twelve o'clock.
The whole army had been ordered
out to witness the shooting of these
men, so, after placing my detail in
front of No. 4, I turned it over to the
sergeant and joined the group of of
ficers who were standing in the rear
of the squads discussing the painful
duty each had to perform.
Hearing my name called, I turned
anxd was called one side by a brother
officer, who said: "Do you know, lieu
tenant, whom you are to execute to
day?"
"No," I replied; "all I can tell is
that I was assigned to No. 4. Can you
tell?" I asked.
"Yes," he answered. "No. 4 is poor
Charley Hodson."
f felt my legs giving way and I
should have fallen had he not caught
iuc. Instantly I recovered; then, for
the first time in many years, tears
came to my eyes and rolled down my
cheek.
It was appalling to give the com
mand that would end the life of my
comrade and best friend, for I had
learned to love the boy as a brother;
he was so kind, so gentle and so brave.
Capt C-, of the - Tennessee
regiment, came up to me and asked
what thle bad news was. I told him
and, like the gallant fellow that he
was. he offered to exchange places,
thounh he knew it might cost him his
commission. We had no time to think,
for at that moment we heard the
strains of the dead march and look
ing upl saw the condemned men ap
proaching.
WVe ran hurriedly to our details,
told the sergeants of the change, and
then exchanged places.
In front of each squad stood a stake
and a cogin, and as the line ap
proached each man was halted before
a cofin.
Justbefore they were to be bound
andblindfolded I heard a voice say:
"~Kiss Eugenia and my father for me,
lieutenant, and tell them that the last
throb of this heart was an echo of my
love for them."
"'Great Ood!" I exclaimed aloud. "I
dadn't know it was you, Paul."
T'he next moment my mind had gone
back to a little more than a year be
fore, when our army had been In-Ten
nessee and Kentucky.
On that campaign I had met and I
loved the most beautiful woman I had
ever seen. She. waQ perfect ii every
way. A eultuared min l~ tender heart,
·* ilovida·n~ngaiftos.ad a Lottah ra
s~hr vluje
She had soft, dreamy black eyes, and,
when excited, they were brighter than
the dewdrop on the rone,
I visited her hhfime oft42 fnd was al
W:'ays wveldomed with a sunny smile;
but time passed rapidly and soon orders
canme for us to plepare to march--tl.
fvet thing I dreaded.
I left t*amp and went to pay my last
visit to i er with a heavy heart.
Sitting in the shadow of a large ar
bor vitn tree. with her hands in mine,
I told her of my love. It was needless,
though, for me to have spoken one
word of thlat love, for she knew it long
be fore.
For a moment she hesitated, and
I then told her of net orders to move
and possibly this Would be oulr last
meeting Uintil the strife Was Over.
That seemed to decide it, fdr; look
ing up into ifi tI&c, site -said: "It is
useless be tell you of my love for you,
for you must know that it is as true
and pu. , as ever a woman gave to
man."
Reaching up to a branch of the tree
under which we were sitting, she
pulled a tiny sprig and gave it to Ind;
saying: "'That tree is green as long as
God permits it to lir?. It is green for
ever; and so shall my love for you be.
Only be as true to me as I shall be to
you, and when this cruel war is over
hasten back to mesand then there shall
be no more parting. My prayers shall
be for you and my darling brother;
for, next to you, I love him. Should
you ever meet him again and he should
in any way need assistane, be good to
him for the love I give you. .Take this
sprig to remind you, if need be, of my
love. I shall wear one like it every
day until you feturn."
I could not speak, but folded her to
my heart and gave the first golden kiss
of love.
While young Hlammond belonged to
the same army as myself I had never
seen him. except once, until the day of
the execution, when he sent the last
loving message to his sister-my in
tended bride.
When I saw him standing before me
it was too late, for in a moment the
command: "Ready, aim, fires" was
given and Paul Hammond lay dead be
-fore me, by my command.
W'ho can picture my utter despair at
that moment? As I saw the fire flash
front the muzzle of those muskets I
bade farewell to all hope of happiness
in this life.
Some weeks after the execution I re
ceived a letter and I instantly recog
nized Eugenia's writing.
Enclosed was a clipping fromn a Dal
ton newspaper, with my name and her
brother's marked, and a long account
of the affair. There was also a notice
of the death of her old father caused
by the shock of his son's death.
She wrote just a few lines; I shall
never forget them: "May God forgive
you as I do. This gulf can never be
bridged-not even by an idolatrous
love."
I never wrote to her, for I felt it was
useless. So time paised, and in the
summer of 1879 1 went to the Green
Brier white sulphur springs.
The first evening there I saw a mag
nificently-dressed woman whirling in
the waltz that somehow attracted my
attention. Nearer and nearer she
came and at last our eyes met.
Instantly she sank to the foor, and
just as quickly was she surrounded by
her friends.
I saw pinned to her left breast by a
beautiful diamond heart a piece of ar
bor vitas. and I recognized Eugenia,
my lost love.
1 left the place that night and have
never seen her since. I sometimes
hear of her through friends, and never
has a December passed since the war
that I did not get a sprig of arbor
vite--the emblem of our love.
I still have her letters in a little
casket, and sometimes when I am
vexed with the cares of this life I read
them over s.nd over. In one of them I
meet the lines:
'" have another life I long to meet.
Without which life. this life is incomplete.
Oh! sweeter self. like me, art thoum astray,
Trying with all thy mind to find the way?
Striving with all thy might to find the breast
On which alone can weary heart b nd rest?"
The mystery of Eugenia's fainting is
told here for the first timb. Should
she read this, let her know that the
love of 1894 is just as strong as that of
1862.
Through the influence of strong
friends Charley Hudson was pardoned
while at the stake, and he is to-day a
leading citizen of our state.

Napolon as a lMarksman.
Although Napoleon was a great gen
eral, beyond dispute, it appears from
some recently published recollections
of two of his favorites that he was a
very poor marksman. Yet he was fond
of hunting, and something had to be
dlone to eater to his vanity. It seems
that whenever a stag vas brought to,
bay, it was usual to leave the animal
to be killed by the emperor. On one
such occasion he could not be found,
and the master of the hounds did the
business. Suddenly, Napoleon was
seen approaching, and the stag was
hurriedly propped up on his legsvwi h
tree boughs. The gun was handed to
the emperor, and he fired at the stag,
wh-h~rcupon the master of the hounds
slightly disturbed the boughs, and the
stag fell to the ground. Napoleon was
completely deceived, and observed,
complacently: "After all, I em not so
bad a shot aos they try to mkke out."

HUNTING THE CHAMOIS.
An Animal That In Very Keen-Scented and
TVary.
Speaking generally, I am inclined to
think that the chamois is not the pre
ternaturally wary beast he is usually
represented to be. Of his comparative
indifference to noises, as long as they
are not too loud, I have already spoken.
Nor, in my opinion, is his eyesight any
thing remarkable. Judging from his
failure to distinguish objects. such as
a man's head or hand, as long as they
are motionless, I should say that the
organs of vision of chamois are scarcely
more acute than those of human beings.
•On the other hand, their sense of smell
is quite extraordinary; hence the wind
is by far the worstenemy of the hunter.
The shifting eddies and currents, blow
ing now this way, now that, now up
hill, now down, multiply tenfold the
chances in favor of the game.
I have often asked friends of mine
who have hunted in various countries
as to the distance at which deer and
other wild animals can scent a-human
being, and most of them seem to be
agreed that they will wind you more
than a mile off. I have certainly seen
chamois over half a mile distant make
off in alarm when they could not possi
bly have seen anything to disturb them.
It is curious, too, how much more the
hunter's odor seems to terrify them
than the mere sight of him. In the
latter case, unless you are quite close,
they whistle and move off quietly.
turning round every few hundred yards
to look; while if they get your scent
they will throw up their heads wvithlan
expression of utter disgust that is high
ly diverting, and, without hesitating a
moment, gallop away at top speed.

PUNISHED FOR CURIOSITY.
A Learned Chinese Doctor Pays Dearly
for a Little Innocent Silghteecing.
It is dangerous to gratify curiosity or
to violate precedent at the Chinese im
perial court. The empress dowager is
a great stickler for etiquette. Recently
she required the services of Dr. Li
Te-ch'ang, vice-president of the impe
rial academy of physicians at Peking,
for one of the members of her suite at
Eho Park palace. The learned doctor
had never been inside these famous
palace-grounds, and his curiosity was
fired to see the many curious objects of
which he had heard wonderful tales.
So he bribed a palace eunuch to show
him around the grounds.
While the two were leisurely walk
ing about and enjoying themselves, the
empress spied them. She at once die
patched servants to punish theireffron
tery. The eunuch was seized, thrown
on his face, and accommodated with
fifty blows with the bamboo on the
calves of his fat legs. The' doctor was
docked three months' pay and received
a severe reprimand, while his assistant
was ordered never to venture again
into the empress's presence.
The affair created a sensation, be
cause of the high position of the physi
cian and of the humiliating punishment
dealt out to him.-N. Y. Sun.

with which he may restore the wasted
fertility of his long-abused soils and do
it in the sway that nature intended
it should be dnne. Very few of our
farmers have studied the subject
suffilcently to be able to recognize
even a fraction of the long list that
nature offers to hima for the combined
purpose of stock food and soil fer
tilizer. It is quite trite that if he
would make full use even of the few
that he is familiar with he would suf

adapted to his use. There are few
farmers who are ignorant of Bermuda,
crabgrass. lespedeza, sorghum and the

make stock raising an abundant suc

along with their forage corn and field

And yet there should be little diffi

establish improved pastures or mead

is best to use from six to a dozen dif

several growing while others are in a
measure dormant, deferring their best
growth to another season. No two
plants, probably, are just alike in their
needs or demands upon the soil. One
plant will suffer from too much rain or
too much dry weather, wthen another
would be just suited. One is attacked
by insects where another escapes. One
yields to rust or mildew under certain
conditions of weather, when another is
not affected at all.
In the older countries of Europe,
where time has had its opportunity to
prove most things relating to agricul
ture, farmers never think of establish
ing a meadow or pasture with only two
or three plants, but use from six to
twenty different kinds, and such pas
tures and meadows actually rent for
more yearly than our best lands are
worth; in many cases more than 650
per acre.
Are not many of our readers contem
plating doing something in this direc
tion? Now is the time to begin the
work. Near our cities and large towns
a good -pasture is an investment that
pays more than most of our cultivated
crops. Think about it! - Southern

WINTERING HOGS.
Seome Saggestons In Regard to Doing It
Eeonoalcai!y.
One of the mott important items in
making fall pigs profitable is to winter
economically. In doing this. growth
must not be sacrificed. The idea must
be to make a steady growth at as low a
coast as possible. If growth were not to
be considered, they might be wintered
wery economically so far as feed is con
cerned, yet all that is given to stock as
feed and no gain is secured, is so much
added to the cost, without any possible
income. One of the essential conditions
ih securing the best profit with hogs
is to push the growth from the start,
and secure a quick growth and an
early maturity. One of the principal
reasons why so many fail to make fall
pigs profitable is because sufficient
care is not taken to push the growth
in good season.
One of the most mhnportant items in
wintering pigs economically is a com
fortable shelter. The saving secured
with good shelter in feed alone will
make a fair profit of itself, besides se
curing rather a better gain. Maintain
ing animal heat through the winter by
feeding grain adds to cost of keeping
the hogs very materially-in fact, in
many cases it destroyes any profit. Of
course, in the south, where the winters
at best are short, and not at any time
severe, the cost of wintering without
shelter is much less than further north.
Yet the better comfort provided by
supplying good shelter, securing at all
times a better, thriftier gain for the
amount of food consumed, will make
the cost of supplying good shelter a
profitable investment. It is not neces
sary to have the hog house expensive;
in fact, it is not advisable, for the rea
son that as usually managed it is not
good economy to allow the hog house
to remain in one place too long, and
this makes it best not to invest too
much in a house than can not be moved
conveniently.
Three items are essential; one is to
have dry. There are few things more
injurious to the health and thrift of
hogs than to eat or sleep in damp
places. Another item is convenience,
botl for feeding and for keeping elean.
More or less work is necessary if the
proper cleanliness is secured, and a lit
tle care in arranging will make little
difference in work necessary to keep
clean. Warmth, with proper ventila
tion, is the third essential. One ad
vantage with good, dry earth pens is,
that warmth is easier maintained than
with almost any kind of an earth floor.
Some ventilation should be provided,
marranged so that in case of severe
storms or cold they can be closed up if
considered necessary to secure proper
warmth. The general plan or arrange
ment can be made to suit the individ
ual taste. It is always best to arrange
for plenty of room, as good health can
not be easily maintained when the hogs
are crowded.

what cause are all these untoward

Keep down these and the greatest bet

a clean, fresh dust bath where every
chick and mature fowl on the place
can dust itself without molesta

placed around in various spots
on a large poultry farm. Good strong
tobacco powder is as good as anything
to put in the feathers of the birds.

COTTON-SEED MEAL.
A South Carolinian Wants to Learn It
Value as Howg eed.
I have been thinking for a long time
that I would write something for the
inquiry department of your paper, as it
seems to me that if this was done more
generally by the farmers it might be
made the most profitable part of your
paper. So I send you a few inquiries,
as I am very anxious to learn the value
of cotton-seed as a stock food, in all its
forms.
It has occurred to me of late years
that, perhaps. the south was wasting?
annually millions of dollars by not
using all the cotton-seed made on the
plantations. In the first place to grow
and fatten stock for market and home
cansumption.
I have been very much pleased by
your efforts to teach the farmers of the
south how to raise hogs. I trust ypu
will continue this thing. It is one of
the problems the south is bound to
solve. It have no doubt that when it
is solved it will be seen that the month
can raise her own meat as cheaply as
the northwest. because we have so
much better climate. The only reason
it is not done now is because our peo
ple have not learned how. They nmust
be taught. The only plan has been to
raise hogs upon what they could find
in the forest and some corn, principal
ly, however, upon such food as they
could obtain in the forest.
The increase of population and stock,
and settlement of the country, with
destruction •of the forests, have made
the old plan a thing of the past; but'
the great majority of our people have
not learned much beyond it. And corn.
is too expensive a diet upon which to
grow hogs exclusively.-Cor. Southern
Farmer.
HERE AND THERE.
-It is said that "it is hard to get
blood out of a turnip," this may be true,
but if fed to poultry it is not a difficult
matter.
-Ducks and geese should not be
overlooked in the poultry yards. They
are both profitable and can be com
bined with other fowl raising to ad'
vantage.
-If your supply of fodder is short,
you will find a fall crop of -.Hngarian
