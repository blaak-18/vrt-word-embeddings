The Cause of Causse.
We are all striving to fnd out
the real moving cause of the great
agricultural depression in the
South. Every honest man. every
true iatriot want= to di-cover the
true causie and the true remedy.
heaven know- that we are willihi
to, wrk fir theli reedil . nllo maittoer
what is the cau'e. We w'ant to
build up. not pull hdown. We are
realdy to. accelt any s elution that
furnishes relie f.
But i(ndir41ig the lisicussion, we
-te constrained to adhere to
the oioion that the two great
:minses of leL.r4s.-ion inl cotton art

the preicrst agricultural crisis in
thie So"uth. hi:: assigned due ii,
portance to the currer.rc question
in its issue of Oct. 21. It demnen
strates what we have always said,
that the disease from which the
conmmercial and agrricultural world
has been suffering for twenty years
is the apl'rcciatinrg kold standard of
mo:iyv which has made slaves of
the debtor class, which Las increas
ed their burdens from year to year,
which has made mon,,y dear and
labor cheap, which has decreased
the price of farms and farm iro
ducts and rai~ld the rates of inter
est. Savys the Times-Demnocrat:
"With ,c,tton at 5c, and whent
at 50 cents iper bushoel. there seems
to be a growing conviction that the
world's tinancial system is Iaboring
under some general and deep-l.-at
ed disease. The malady is gene
ral. Therefnre is is ain to attril,
ate it to any loal cause. Over
production will not explain it. If
we take cotton as an example, we
fnd that middling was selling at 7
cents at the close of the season of
18 9:;-94 while it was still unknoi wn
whether the crop of 15,4-9.5 was
to be very small, moderate or very
larg6. `tie ` visible supply was
then equal to fifteen weeks' con
sunmption. -If we go back ten
ears from that late, we find mid
it1ln selling at 10k, with a visible
Supply equal t'- fourteen weeks'
consumnption. The difference in
the exchangeable value of silver
and gold at the two dates mentiP n
ed explains the matter. Any other
exjilaation is merely an attenll.t
to ~'y the existence of a disease
fi ordor to refuse the patient the
r.medy he demands."
This is true as Lespel. :It is
strange that our people so vitally
interested cannot understand it.
The Tarl-I)emocrat lpoints to the
:Let tllht priCes have not fallen in
silver standard countries and that
thb6 price pai4 for cotton to-day in
Inmii is the srime s was lpid when
-middling was selling at 19 cents in
New Orleans. Yet England fixes
the I.rice tn both markets. All
over the world there has been a
sbrinkage of values where the gold
sfandard has prevailed. The
Pares-Democrat well says that the
repeal of the Sherman law intensi
