oMiivcnvkHott Of Hie printers in um

the taprftaton that tliey t»a»l tliwn
m *I v <«1| m 4 engaged in (he affair,
bcinpàt ike time employed in the
offlo* & l\à 'D<**<xr*t Wo wore
certainly uuiler that impression at
the time we gave our testimony be
fore the Congrfw»ional Committee.
W« learn from them now that I hey
mere MOT engaged in the affair and
that there were only two of the
employee* of the Democrat concern
eil in it. So much for the explana
tion.
Our recollection of the way the
matter eaine up in the testimony is
aboutaa follows : we being in the
witness stand under oath.
Q. Mr. Frye Was the Repub
lica n paper, called the Kapides Tri
Urne , over mobbed and the materi
al destroyed I
Alia. Some portion of the mate
rial and a partot the press was des
troyed.
Q. By a mob I
A. No.
Q. Then who did it 1
A. I believe that it. was done by
the employees of another paper.
Q. A Democratic paper f
A- T«i.
That was about the substance,
whether or not it was the exact
words used by us. We were under
oath and compelled to state tin
tacts as we believed them whether
foi or against our side Having as
certained that there were l»»it tiro
of tho employees of the, Democrat
engaged in it we make this explan
ation for what it worth to satisfy
tho Democrat.
CT* Lest one of Mr. F rye's ques
tions to us on our examination; before
the Committee, lis published in the
testimony this morning, should lend
to any misapprehension we explain
the mntter as it actually occurred.—
The report of the newspaper from
which we have tnkeu the testimony
is very meogro und not ahvnys cor
rect. He pressed ns to know whether
in oar opinion there hud been frauds
in Rapides snd Natchitoches in '72.
As to the Istter palish we referred
him to Mr £. L. Pierson, who had
boen on the stand as a radical wit
ness. As to Rapides we told liim
that wo bad taken no part in the
campaign and know nothing of it of
our knowledge, that the negroes said
they had n< t been allow k I t j register
and that was ail we knew about it.—
The report has it that we said that
if there had been nil over the State
such frauds as were practised in Ita
pides and Natchitoches that Kellogg
would have been elected. We did
not say that there were any! fraud
in either Rapides or Natchitoches.
Cy* By reference to his card in
this morning's issuo it will be seen
that Mr Joseph Bouilliotte is pre
pared to deliver the very best of lum
ber on the shortest notice, and in
anj quantities.
We bespesk for Mr Bouillotte a
fair share of the patronage of the
publie and wo can assure all who
need lumber that by ordering from
biui they will escApe tho annoyance
of delays attendant upon the delivery
of bills ordered, which is no small
item, snd that they will always get
first class lumber.
Ö*" We would remind those who
occasionally take a " smile " that
the Jewel is the place to get it.—
Don't take our word lor it, but go
and see for yourself.

ALL ABOUT THE COMPEOIIISE.
Saturday Morning'* Bulletin.
There were many rumors current
off the streets last night about the
action of the Conservative caucus,
then in session, debating the sub
ject of {effecting an adjustment of
the present political dilllculties.
Up to 11 o'clock these was a
heavy debate in which all the prom
j lient leaders of the Conservative
partv took part. The proposition
offered, as stated by our informant,
was that the Conservativ.es should
have a majority of about ten in the
House ami that the past action of
the Kellogg government should not
be inquired into.
. The debate was kept up until
about midnight, and when a vote
was taken as to the proposition of
fer red, the v.ote stood thirty eight
in favor of this compromise to
twenty seven against it. After the
ballot had been taken that sterling
patriot, L. A. Wilt/,, announced
that he tendered his resignation -
for the reason that he believed his
constituents elected him to repre
sent them truly and fairly.
Alter this, (jov. MeKnery who by
courtesy was allowed to he present,
stated that lie had borne the ban
ner of the Democracy for two years
as proudly to the Iront, as his abili
ties permitted him, but the action
of the caucus was evidence, to him
that, it was time to lower it, and he
wished to retire.
]| we are correctly informed, (lie
action taken last night is, in a de
gree, au acquiescence in the gov
ernment, of t hat faaud and usurping
trickster, by the grace of the, vice
gerent Diirell, called <î >v. Kellogg.
Hnliudiiy Evening's Bulletins Extra.
The announcement made iu the
liulletin this morning that the Con
servatives members of the Legisla
ture, in caucus assembled, had last
night accepted the proposition
tendered by the Republican mem
bers of the < 'ongress onal Commit
tee, which contemplates the recog
nition of the Kellogg usurpation
and Michael Ilahn as the legal
Speaker of the House, created lite
most profound amazement and dis
gust.
The fact that the announcement
was not made iu any other paper
led many to hope, that it wis un
founded—a sad and horrible mis
take—but iufjiiirics soon proved
that the liulletin had not even told
half ihe dreadful and humiliating
truth.
it appears that the matter is even
than we imagined—that , t h illy
eight, persons elected by the people,
to represent their interests and to
combat to the death the infamous
usurpation set up by Grant, Wil
liams, Morton, Dareil & Co., have
solemnly agreed to vote for a joint
resolution
RECOGNIZING TICK KELLOGG USUR
PATION,
and acquiescing in the same the
balance ot his term. They further
have solemnly agreed to abstain
from arraigning Kellogg for any of
Iiis actions iu the past; iu other
words, they have consented to con
done his crimes, however out
rageous they may be, and great as
we know them to be, and to walk
into the the ;
BARRICADED STATE nOUSK
virtually hand-jHiftcd to take, scats
iu a House presided over by .Michael
Ilahn. These are the plain, mi
varnished facts; this is the shame
fill action of men iu whom the peo
ple oi Louisiana reposed failli, and
in whose keepii g she believed her
fair fame and honor were safe. TI m»
thing—the odious thing—which the
Radical caucus in Congress declined
to do by an overwhelming vote—
the recognition; of Kellogg as the
Governor ot Jliouisiana—has been
done by the majority of the Con
servative members of our House.
The people will not submit to
this action, but] will
RKjfclATK IT
and hold tho'm;tMi who have done
this thingaccotjutablc for their acls.
It is gratifying;to know that Gov.
.John MeKnci'i - , Speaker L. A.
Wilts?, and Representative l^Évard
Booth fought sSrenously ngaieat the
humiliating action and pleair with
tho members earnestly to recede
from the position they had taken.
In the name of the whhc people
of Louisiana, ijji the name of the
fair-minded piffiple of the country,
who have nobly made the cause ot
Louisiana the» own, in the name ot
all that we liojd dear, we demand
that the AGTljON SHALL BE RK
COXSIDERElJ, ami that Louisi

Preparatioiyire making for
a gran'l) mass m k kt i no
to protest against this, the most
monstrous outrage of the age, and
there will be such an outpouring of
the people we h re convinced as will

individual repfesentutives îaay act,
that the people, nl least are

the shameless authors dare main

are at etake, and an act is about to
be consummated which if sanction

the plummet of a whole people's
contempt can never reach as.
Those you trusted have failed you
in the hour of your extremest need,
and from the proud position which
you have occupied before the world,
a position won by long suffering
and by the blood of your fellow
citizens, you aTe about to be cast

and disgrace.

as a determined and free people
and utter a protest which will ling
over the the country and tell to our
biet In en of other States that we
have had no part in this monstrous
business, and whatever a few of
our serra u ta may have done iu de
fiance of our known wishes, we
pledge them undying opposition to
depotism and usurpation in what
ever form they my present them
selves.
It is the voice of the people which
we echo—not merely our own
thought and .sentiment. The ac
tion of the. betrayers of the citadel
and central stronghold of civil lib
■
, ■ I , . ,
Cl't> IS beyond expression ignoble
and unmanly. I' rom the Spartan
band, who, as we thought, stood
ke a bra/en wall, (irm as adamant
and pure as snow, such a retreat
from their nobie stand, such a la!
j bug away from their lolly and elo
quent declarations, such a bowing
down before the, sceptre and pat
ronage ol the usurper, was the last
thing^dreanied ot hy their country
men.
TIIK ACTION OP THE CAtiVs Dors NOT
00 110 WN—TIIK I N DIliN AT ION THIS MOftNINO.
The news that the Conservative
caucus last night had accepted and
condoned the past action of Kel
logg, was received this morning
with indignation.
The people when they elected
representatives to the Legislature
j at the last election, thought that
j this time they had sent men who
would maintain the people's long
crusade against flic usurper, but it
seems lor reasons best known to
the members who voted in the
allimative oil the question, the ma
jority concluded to accept the usur
pation and put out a flag of truce.
The representatives of the Hulk
tin circulated amongst people ol
every class this morning for the
purpose of ascertaining the state of
teeling over the compromise, if it
can he called such, and without a
single exception those conversed
with were loud in their denuncia
Iion ot the whole affair.
From the humble yet intelligent
laborer to the wealthiest banker,
every man ol them, not. simply con
fining himself to a condemnation of
the course, openly advanced his
firm determination not to abide by
the action of the caucus.
H i* have never known so strong
a feeling on any question as that
everywhere exhibited this morn
ing, and we are satisfied the true
people will not accept the proffered
treaty.
TH AT CA reus.
The biow has fallen, and the
chosen representatives of the peo
ples rights have accepted the situa
tion. Our citizens have fought the
battle for years with that persisten
cy which only a sense of all that is
noble in so great a cause can in
spire. Alas! that wc should live
to tell the tale!
The debate in the Conservative
caucus last night was prolonged
until after midnight, and our efforts
to obtain the full particulars of
this disastrous truth were crowned
with but partial success. But now
it has gradually leaked out. and
the names which hereafter shall ap
pear prominent in this great wrong
will be accepted by all lovers ot
true poliitical rights in the light
which their actions, and their ac
tions only, can justify.

ing the. hnlel Jitdyo Wheeler was waited
upon hv the Committee from the caucus,
and was handed the iiroiiosed nuTceiiient
„»itious decided upon late Monday
night by the caucus, hut no formal consul
elation was had, nor was the propositions
discussed before Mr. Wheeler left. What
the basis proposed by the caucus is, cannot
be dclinately stated at present, but enough
has leaked out, however, to justify the
prediction ami statement that the lirst
modification of the original terms propos
ed.by Mr. Wheeler was not embodied in
the agreement, decided upon Monday night,
in caucus. That modification was t» the
ellect that instead of the joint resolution
pledging both branches of the Legislature
'Dot, to permit articles of impeachment
against Kellogg, Ihe Democratic members
should give an in lividua! guarantee writ
ten I hat no measures would be taken hy
them having for their object the over
throw of the Kellogg Government, and
that, as was t he case with the joint resolu
tion proposition, was rejected by tho cau
cus; some of the members favored it, how
ever, as t he only basis that could be agreed
upon by the Congressional Committee and
tht> Democrats, and iu secret aession on
Monday urged its adoption, but no effect,
and Unding that the oyposition was strong
against any recognition of Kellogg, even
though it, gave them control of the Legis
lature, a few members of the majority
bolted ill the midnight session on Monday
and voted lor the proposition that was re
ferred to Judge Wheeler previous to his
departure. As that, proposition fails to re
cognize the legality of Kellogg'. s election
it is safe to expect that it will not be
agreed to by tho Committee, and they pes
sibly may not submit it to the cutire Com
mittee uf seven, upon their at rival at
Washington, though requested to do so by
the Democrats, w ho expect to secure the
influence of Phelps and Foster. /r may be
possible however that the ent ire committee
will agitate the subject before the sub-com
mittee present their report, though the
prospect for such agitation is not in the
least flattering.
We learn from a very prominent, mem
her of the Démocratie caucus that the re
port published in Ihe 'June* of Tuesday
.Morning was a correct statement of the fi
nal action on the subject of an adjustment.
From several sources we have ascertained
that the proposition finally adopted was
almost unanimously agreed to, ami th*t it
contains a full statement of the position
and demands of the Democratic party as
any fair minded man would regardas be
ing necessary ; on the other hand, it, con
cedes to the Republicans all they can rea
sonably expect. The vote to appoint a
committee to prepare the plan stood -ill to
:>. r >, but the vote on the adoption of their re
port was nearly unanimous
The caucus met at the appointed hour
on Tuesday, and immediately went into
executive session, and so remained during
the residue of their meeting.
Jhas been given out that, having adop
ted a plan of adjustment and submitted it
to the Congressional .Committee, nothing
more remains for tliein todoon that sub
ject, until action of some kind has been
taken by the arbitrating committee.
Under these circumstances it, is possible
the caucus will suspend its.sittings for the
present.
