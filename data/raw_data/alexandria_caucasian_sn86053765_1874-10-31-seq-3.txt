The Lee Memorial Monument
f. The latest news trom the Lee Me
morial Association is that Prof. Ed
ward Y. Valentine, the sculptor, has
oprocured from Vermont a block of
pure white marble, from which he is
now fashioning a recumbent figure
of Gen. Lee, to be placed on the
grand monument that is now being
erected at his tomb, at the Washing
ton and Lee University, Lexington,
Va. The figure represents Gen. Lee
reposing in an easy position upon a
coach, his head and shoulders slight
ly raised above the body, his left
arm outstretched by the side of his
sword, his right arm laid across his
breast. He wears full Confederate
uniform, including boots and gaunt
kts.and a light drapery covers nearly
the whole form. The appearance is
natural and graceful, indicating peace
ful slumber rather than death.
This monument., when surmounted
with such a fine work of art, will be
n lasting memorial to ono of Vir
ginia's noblest sons and patriots.—
The members of this Association are
gentlemen well and favorably known

INTIMIDATION.
[From the Shreveport Tini<-s.l
The arrest of thirteen prominent
citizens of Coushatta by a fellow
named Stockton, holding a commis
sion as Deputy U. S. Marshal, and
supported in his infamous work by
a body of Federal troops, was as
vile a piece of business as men
wearing the uniform of a great na
tion were ever guilty of performing.
Of the thirteen men arrested, and
whose names we gave yesterday
morning, not one of them had any
thing to do with the killing of the
six Red River carpet-baggers, or
with any conspiracy looking to
their deaths. Their arrest was as
arbitrary and lawless a proceeding
as could be carried out under the
Turkish despotism. On being ar
rested they asked the fellow Stock
ton to show the warrants for their
arrests and ho declined to do so,
saying they should see them in due
time ; and the gentlemen arrested
are at this moment confined under
a guard of United States troops—
kept from their business, deprived
of their liberties, and separated
from their families without a knowl
edge of the authority by which they
are thus treated and without a
jknowledge of the crime of which
the .? me accused. Is this republi
!
eanism 1 is it justice? is it common
humanity Î Can it be possible that
the Administration is a party to
this scandalous proceeding ?
Perhaps it is ; indeed we have no
doubt that it is. President Grant
violated every principle of honesty,
of law and common decency in set
ting up the Kellogg usuipatiou, and
lr\ through his dirty henclunen, is
determined to justify that action by
using such brutal means as will in
tiinidate the white people ; prevent
thorn from voting or working in this
election, niul thus leave the negroes
to carry the Shite to vindicate, his
judgment, that Louisiana was and
is radical or negro in politics.

If'I . S. Deputy Marshals, or
Marshais, and Federal troops may
arrest citizens, as they have done
in this instance, without producing
their authority to do so, then there
is an end to civil liberty; nay there
is an end of law, and men must re

S. Deputy Marshal Stockton or any
officer of the Federal army to arrest
citizens of this or any other State
without producing warrants for
such arrests ? None, whatever,
and the proceedings at Coushatta
was an unmitigated outrage; a dis
grace to the army and a disgrace to
the Federal government. Indeed
tho whole proceeding was simply a
measure of intimidation, in the in
terest of radicalism ; in the interest
i °f P°Dtio a l robbery, aud designed to
vindicate the infamous action of

Any persons in Red River, or

Significance of the Lati Eleotions.
[From the Baltimore (M«l.) Sun.]
The significance of the late elec
tions in Ohio and Indiana seems to
have proved a fjifficnlt problem for
the party press to solve. Not only
do democratic and republican pa
pers take different views of the cau
ses which bave led to recent results
in those States as well as same oth
er portions of the country, but even
journals of the same political pro
fessions are found drawing diame
trically opposite conclusions from
the same state of facts A collec
tion of the "opinions of the press"
upon the "recent elections" would,
therefore, throw but little light up
an the subject. The one patent
fact which is more apparent than
anything else is the remarkable vi
tality which still animates the body
of what has been so frequently pro
nounced the moribund, if not dé
funt democratic party. Despite of
a long period of enforced absti
nence from the flesh pots of office—
despite of repeated reverses an 3
much abuse and ill repute—despite,
too, of what some people peisisted
in regarding as tho deliberate act
of feto de se perpetrated in the nom
ination of Horace Greeley for the
presidency, the democratic party is
not only still alive, but "alive and
kicking." This shows that when
the President in his message last
December felicitated Congress upon
tho gradual extinction of party
lines, "particularly in the agricul
tural regions," he was somewhat
premature in his congratulations,
it further shows that tho time is
not ripe for the formation of new
parties, and that the new battles
will probably continue to be fought
out under the old party names. The
probabilities are that the year 187G
will see the old parties again ar
rayed against each other as in
times past. The truth is that is
sues may change aud men may
charge with them, but there are
certain cardinal principles applica
ble to the construction of the feder
al constitution which are coeval
with the instrument itself, anil
which, despite of many short com
ings and some inconsistencies, the
democratic party professes to have
handed down from the foundation
I of the government, and to keep in
jtaet to tli is day. These principles,
particularly those which relate to
the powers of the federal govern
ment over the States, and to the
itruo canon of constitutional con
j struction, have been lately grow
ling again in popular favor as the
j need of returning to them as bar
riers against usurpation and cen
tralization has been more and more
! pressingly felt. Beyond this and
j the evidence furnished of increas
inir dissatisfaction with the repub
lican administration of affairs,
there is nothing specially marked
about the late elections. The re
publicans have gone into the State
canvass in different States heavily
weighted with the Louisiana busi
ness. the, Arkansas business, credit
mobilier and back pay. People
have grown tired of hearing merit
claimed for the investigation of
abuses and scandals which the par
ty in power itself originated. Even
upon the currency question men
have probobably voted not so much
as their inflation theories or hard
money preferences inclined them
as to mark their disgust with the
failure of the republican majority
in the two houses of Congress to do
anything. The elections indicate
not so much, therefore, a conver
sion ot the people to democratic
principles, or their abmlonirient of
the republican platform, as their
willingness to accept a change in
the hope of reform and their pref
erence for sound practice over any
platform. They are \ery far from
foreshadowing necessarily a return
or the democratic party to power,
unless the warning should be so far
lost upon tho republican party and
improved by the democratic as to
make the chances of an honest and
faithful administration of the gov
ernment upon strictly conservative
and economical principles more
probable under the rule of the lat
ter party than of the former.

M onroe , Li., Oct. 26— N. J.
Scott, Parish Judge, and S. W.
Ramsey, Recorder of Claiborne
Parish, Dr. Richardson, Mayor of
Homer, and James Huey, S. May
field, and P. L. Phillips of Lincoln,
were brought hero this morning
under a cavalry escort. Huey and
Richardson were handcuffed to
gethcr. The prisoners were impris
oned under a close guard in the
Sheriff's office. Their counsel were
admitted on a written order.
The Claiborne prisoners are charg
ed with an attempt to break up a
peaceable assemblage, on the 11th
of July, in Homer, when Mayor
Richardson, Ramsey and Scbtat
were active in preventing a riot.
The Liucoln prisoners are.charg
ed with an attempt to compel Jew
ett, by whom the warrants are is
sued, to resign as Uuited States
Commissioner in Lincoln. The
prisoners declare they did uot know
fie was a Commissioner aud never
made such a demand.
The prisoners were arrested with
out resistance, but hurried from
home without time to consult their
families or get a change of clothes.
When Huey asked for the anthori
ty for his arrest, Lieut. Hodgson,
in charge of the cavalry, drew a re
peater, saying: "This is my au
thority."
A squad of soldiers were brought
in with loaded carbines, when Dep
uty Marshal Selye drew out a pair
of handcuffs aud placed them on
Huey's wrists with his hands be
hind his back.
The entire party were lodged last
night in Lincoln jail.
A room in the jail here is prepar
ing for tho prisoners' accommoda
tion, with niueteen prisoners, most
ly negroes aud felons, already con
fined in tho three small rooms.
Claiborne and Lincoln are Demo
cratic parishes. Marshal Selye in
sultingly refused to obey the writ
of habeas corpus issued by District
Judge Trimble, a Republican.
The telegraph wires were cut af
ter leaving Homer.
A prominent Granger and minis
ter states that tho Lieutenant gave
the order to cut the wires and bring
him pieces of them. Great indig
nation is felt here at the airest and
harsh treatment ot tho prisoners,
but the feeling is to submit to the
course of the law.
The belief is general that the ar
rests were made for political effect.
The prosecution is represented by
Col. John Kay, the defense by
Judge Richardson and Capt. Cobb.
A preliminary trial is fixed for to
i morrow before Jewett, of Lincoln,
now holding court here.
The affidavit for the arrest of the
Lincoln prisoners were made by one
Fountain, a white officeholder.
ShrkvepoUT , Oct. 20—The ex
amination of the gentlemen arrest
ed on Saturday has been postpon
ed until to morrow. No additional
arrests have been made here, and
Gen. Merrill now says there will
not be.
The officers of the No 10, which
arrived from below to-night, report
that tho greatest consternation pre
vails at all points below here and
Alexandria.
Tho cavalry are now coming up
the river from Natchitoches, arrest
ing men as they progress.
At the time the Era passed up,
fifteen or twenty men had been ar
rested between Natchitoches and
Grapple's Bluff, and the planters
above the last named point were
expecting to bo taken when the
troops arrived. The officers of the
Era confirm the statement of Capt.
Seovell, of the Bryarly, and state
further that many planters have
fled from their homes, and that the
negroes have gathered in large
numbers at the towns along the
river, leaving unpicked the fiuest
cotton crop in several years.
N ew I beria , Oct. 26.—The St.
Martin prisoners were brought here
to-day by a U. S. Deputy Marshal
and a squad of cavalry. The pre
liminary examination was held be
fore TT. S. Commissioner R H. Rid
dell, District Clerk of Iberia. The
arrests were made under the Ku
Klux act. Two of the prisoners
were bold to bail in $6000 each,
and one in $1000, to appear before
the U. S. District Court. The
fourth, A. Hebert, was discharged.
Prominent citizens of ht. Martin
parish were present to sign bonds
for any amount, but were refused
until they furnished certificates of
property, which prevents the bonds
bei g signed before to-morrow. A
promiuent official of that parish
gave the information that a great
many more arrests would be made

The SrLENCE Broken —A corres
pondent of the New York Sun from
Chanutc, Kansas, October 14, reports
that the President was directly asked
at that place, on his recent visit to tho
Indian Territory, whether fie was a
candidate for a third term. As he did
not seem inclined to reply, the inter
rogator said to those in attendance:
"Boys, silence gives consent." The
President then quickly remarked:
"I'll leave this to the people."
It would seem therefore, that the
President is not willing to have it un
derstood that he "consents" to a third
term, but leaves that question to the
decision of the people. This is ati
adroit answer, and while he does not
deny his aspirations, there can be no
exception to the tribunal to which he
defers. Hitherto the popular tribunal
has given au unvarying series of de
cisions in favor of the precedent set by
General Washington of two terms;
but if President Grant has become
more necessary to the public welfare
than Generai Washiogton was, doubt
' less the people will reverse their old
truie. The late elections, however, do
not seem to indicate any Fenso of the
' necessity to the safety of'he republic
lof a third tum.

sou of Lewis and Pleasant Texada.
It is our melancholy duty to record
above the decease of a bright and gener

awl sorrow to a household whoso idol ho

him for the quickness and brightness of
his intellectual faculties. Cut off thus early

and credit to his family is lost forever.—
He was named after Governor Allen and
with him for a model and his natural in

He leaves a void which can uot be filled
and a place in that happy family circlo
