The nnprecedented snuccess with whichl
the Times has met, since its establish.

preeilate the effbrts of a jon'hal, which,

ofu.it political faith.
1:The public journmal mostly deserving of
1Dmocratic support is the one that, in
ardlition to being a full and faithful and
incsisterit advocate of Dcnoelratic plin

nekspaper for Democrats to support, and
the idea sometimes sought to be nillca-e.
ted,by those who have an interest of their
nwhf h doing so that the people must gp
a' outside their party organ to "tind tihe

WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUIS FOR P175.
('lha',pion, m meritcan Comic Pf pe) !
Illustrated by a corps otthw best Ameri
can artists, and contributed to by the
most popular tnntori$t$s and satirists of
the day.
Wild O(ats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existencc, and
has become the established humuoromns and
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and coitinuicd e he tirt year as a
monlthly, then1, to satisfyt the dienmand of
the public, it was changed to a fortnight
iy. Still conltining its goid work of
hitting hilly as it flies, and showing upl
the political and social shams by its
nasterly cartoons anRlp-pugent editorials,
it achit ved evenii l gr'l;lter sulICCess thallll
lbefore, and was recognized as lth ablest
and brightest of its class. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsie merits, be
ing the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnish illustrations for Wil( Oats are
Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keel tels,
Stuekhardt, Day, Poland, andil several
others who are yet known to falme.
In its literary departments Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will hbe first-class in every
particular, and on this account nay 4,e
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offlnd the most fas
tidions.

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chietly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VIEGAR BITr
TERS " Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life'-giving principle, a Perfeet Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of Vtx
AGAR BITTERS in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of Drn. WALK
.an's VISoAUt IHTT~rts are Aperient. Dia
phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious, Laxa
tive, l)iuretic. Sedative, Counter-Irritant,
Sudorific, Alterative, and Anti-Bilious.
