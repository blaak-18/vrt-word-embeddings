We here have one of the secrets of
this gentleman's success If it Is de
ared to obtain a good supply of but
ter and of the rset quality, the grase
must be cut while it is grasm; it will
not do to wait till it has matured Its
seed. It were better to cut It before
it .blossoms, for then a larger per
centage of butter can be obtained,
and then It will have the aroma of
June butter, though made in Janu
ary. this cutting two crops, if no
more is obtained In weight than
when only one crop Is harvested, has
a declded advantage, for it contains
a larger percentage of digestible
matter, which is more valuable than
that produced from the older ut hay,
because of the larger amount of but
ter it contains and of the essentials
for making a first-class article,
The cutting of grass while it is
grass gives this leading Vermont
dairyman an average of 413 pounds
per cow of frst-elass butter, while
the average production of the State
Is only98 pounds per cow, and only
5 per cent. of this is ranked as first
class. Againla, if the increase of the
average quantity and also the Io
cq~e~ai the percentage of first
lqaalister Is desired, before we
begin to consider the propriety of
purchasing improved utensils for
setting the milk and churning, we
must commence with the feed, and
the first essential is to cut the grass
while it is grass, even if we cut it
three times a year and then only
obtain the same weight that others
do whoeut but once a year. There
is little doubt, however, but that a
larger weight of hay will be obtained
where it Is cut twice than where it is
out but once. In dry seasons like
the present the general idea is to let
the grass stand to fill up, particular
ly if there is an appearance of rain,
and there is no doubt there is a
filling up after a rain comes, in
June, and even later, but that which
fills up is new grass, and while we
are waiting for it the matured grass
is becoming every day of less and less
value.
The most profitable way is to cut
the first, though light, while In
bloom and before rather than after;
then cut that which would fill up if
waited for, and thus obtain twoorops,
which would make first-class butter,
in place of one. The half of two.
thirds of this would do little more
than sustain life, while it would be
the latter growth that would make
the small amount of butter obtained.
Orchard and June grass and clover
are coming forward rapidly, and will
beready to out the first week in June.
Wherever these grasses are cultiva
ted they afford te farmer an oppor
tunity of gettingbis bay while In th3
best opndition, for where timothy
and red-top are the only varieties
grown, some will, as a consequence,
be over-ripe before it can be cut but
when a part of the hay crop consists
of these early grasses they can be se
cured before the latter are ready to
out, and so the farmer can harvest a
whole crop of hay, every part of
which will make art-claes butter.
Clover sown with 'timothy and
red-top is almost worthless be.
fore the grasses are headed out.
If it is desired to secure good bay
for butter, it would be better to cut
even the timothy and red-top while
the clover Is in bloom, than waste
the clover by waiting for the grass.
Where the hay crop is to be sold, the
grower will no doubt consult his own
interests It preference to that of the
purchaser, but even in this case he
might cut early and secure a good
seond erdp, which would be excel
lent for his miluch cows.-[Amerla
