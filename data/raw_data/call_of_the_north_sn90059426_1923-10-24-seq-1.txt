RILEY EXPLODES AT KLAN MEETING
Walton’s* Feet Frost Bitten
The “Four*Flush” Governor of Oklahoma Lays
Down His Hand and Quits Tough Game.
MISFIT HAS ENOU
JACK WALTON’S LITTLE
BUBBLE HAS BUSTED
The four-flush governor of Okla
homa has laid down his hand, and is
ready to quit the game.
He will go down in history as the
monumental misfit in the political
life of Oklahoma.
He moved into the state about eight
years ago, gained a little notoriety
and then sought to bulldoze the entire
state, but he didn’t know his people.
The militia has been called off, but
not paid off.
Money is being mooched all over
America to hire Oklahoma soldiers to
shoot down their own people.
Walton has offered to resign if cer
tain things were done.
The offer was made about twenty
minutes ahead of his being kicked out.
His gunmen have sneaked back to
their stills, and his soldiers have
swapped their guns for deficiency
warrants.
Walton is ready to quit. He is
anxiou° to quit. He has one eye on
the grand jury and the other on
Honduras. He realizes that his bull
dozing tactics and idiotic effrontery
have alienated every man in Oklaho
ma whose friendship is worth having.
He stopped a meeting of the state
legislature with bayonets one week,
and then called them together the
next week. If that isn’t the convul
sions of a diseased brain, I am no
judge of small matters. He spent
SIOO,OOO of Catholic money in assemb
ling the militia to prevent the legis
lature from assembling, and then
called them into session after they
had rushed home.
But there is a joker in his act of
calling the legislature together in spe
cial session.
In a special session the body can
consider no legislation except that
which is submitted to them by the
governor.*
Cunning Jack Walton thinks he has
led the body into another snare, but
wise old Mcßee of Stephens county in
thinking about three jumps ahead of
the governor, and he will ignore the
governor’s call altogether. The body
is going to meet, and it is going to
apply the state boot to the bust of the
governor’s breeches, and land him in
o the junk yard of disgraced gov
ernors along with Sulzer of New York
and Jim Ferguson of Texas.
The broadminded and statesman
like manner in which the leaders of
the Ku Klux Klan handled the situa
tion in Oklahoma has won millions of
friends for the great organization.
Instead of injuring the klan as it was
intended it has proven the greatest
blessing to the order. The Catholics
have again collapsed in their efforts
to put a great “coup” over on ..ue
klan. The Oklahoma sensation has
collapsed on the heads o# the pro
moters, and takes rank with Mer
Rouge, and other fiascos of the
Catholics in their futile fight on the
Ku Klux Klan.
Old Sheriff Cavnar started the Wal
ton gang to running when he drove
the gun specialists, post haste, from
the court house when they came for
the ballot boxes. That one act blew
up the governor.—Mayfield’s Weekly.

Texas newspapers report that a
pink wild cat has not only been seen
but actually captured in Zapata coun
ty. Don’t blame it on the Klan. It
is not the Klan’s fault that such
beverage conditions exist. They be
lieve in putting tequila traders in
the hoosegow.

Will be Greatest Procession Ever
Held By Klansmen At Any Time

Speakers—Officials to Attend
—K-K-K
Fort Wayne, Ind.—Never before in
the history of Klandom will a parade
have been held such as that which is
being planned for this city on Nevem
ber 10, when the hosts of Klandom
meet in this city at the gigantic Ku
Klux Klqn Klonvocation scheduled
for that day. Plahs for the huge
parade are now well under way as
well as the plans for the rest of the
program.
Tens of thousands of Klansmen will
be in line and the procession will
hold many features. Scores of bands,
drum and fife corps and floats will
take part in the parade which will be
the outstanding feature of the day.
The line of march has not been defi
nitely settled upon as yet. All the
prominent Klansmen in the United
States will be a part of the giant pro
cession.
The event, which will last all day
and long into the night, will be a
monstrous affair and reports from
all points tell of large delegations
already having been formed. Thou
sands upon thousands of individual
Klansmen have arranged to be in
Fort Wayne on that day. While it
was first planned for Indiana Klans
men in celebration of Indiana having
attained one-half million chartered
members, and having set a goal for
1,000,000, it is now seen that Klans
men from the surrounding states will
be present.
From each of the states bordering
Indiana word has come that Klans
men from there will be at the Klon
vocation. Michigan, Kentucky, Illi
nois and Ohio will be represented.
Hardly had the word gone out that
the great meeting was to be held on
Armistice day, which will be cele
brated on November 10 this year, ow
ing tp the fact that the eleventh falls
on Sunday, than Klansmen from other
states notified of heir intention of at
tending.
Among the more prominent Klans
men of the nation who will attend
the celebration are “The Old Man,”
The Imperial Wizard, Dr. H. W. Ev
an’ and Grand Dragons from many
points. All the Indiana Klan state
officials will be in attendance also.
Many Features For Day
Included in the list of speakers
for the day are some of the country’s
best known 'patriotic'* speakers. The
best of everything will be had for the
occasion and while the parade will
prove the great feature of the day,
there will be many‘other features in
cluded in the day’s program.
Many committees are hard at work
carrying out plans for the demonstra
tion. Among them are committees
which will perfect parking arrange
ments and provide space for the thou
sands of Klansmen who will motor to
the event

WASHINGTON LATEST
REALM OF THE HAN
Another western state has reached
a sufficiently numerous and active
Klan membership as to warrant its
establishment as an organized realm
of the Invisible Empire under its
own state officers. This is the Realm
of Washington which held its initial
klorero or state convention at Seattle
a few days ago.
The Klan is stronger than ever in
Washington as was evidenced 'by the
enthusiatic gathering which was
presided oveV by the Imperial Klazik
from Atlanta. Klans were represent
ed at the meeting from Seattle, Van
couver, Yakima, Tacoma, Colfax, Bell
ingham, Walla Walla, Hoquiam, Port
Angeles, Spokape, Bremerton, and
Olympia. «*
A well known Seattle business man
was chosen Grand Dragon and Hydras
and Great Titans were also named.
The realm is divided into three pro
vinces, each under a Great Titan.
The Great Titans are located at
Spokane, Hoquiam and Seattle.
Plans were outlined for a great
membership campaign throughout the
new realm with a view of doubling
the number of Klansmen in Washing
ton in six months’ time.

—K-K-K
Arkansas City, Kan.—The local Ku
Klux Klan holds two and three meet
ings each week to take care of the
naturalization of new members. Good
classes are represented at each of
these meetings. The organization is
“getting results” in cleaning up the
law violators in this community and
is co-operating with the “law” to the
fullest extent. Bootleggers and hi
jackers operating in Oklahoma have
found Arkansas City a very unde
sirable haven. Several noted “crooks”
have been turned over to the peace
officers recently by this Klan. The
Arkansas City Klan is proud of its
organization and its class of mem
bers—the better class of members—
which makes it evident that the
“power for good” in the Klan is be
ing felt here.

KU KLUX SPEAKER
AT FERGUS FALLS
—K-K-K"
St. Paul Editor Gives Interesting Lec
ture on Principles and Ideals
of Klan |
—K-K-K
P. J. Ora, editor of “The Call of
the North,” a St. Paul weekly publi
cation, outlined the principles and the
ideals for which the Ku Klux Klan
organization stands at a meeting at
Bayley’s Hall last night.
Mr. Ora appeared in Klan garb and
gave a powerful lecture o 4 Klancraft.
He stated that the organization is
orderly and law abiding -and has for
its object the betterment of the hu
man race. It is a Christian institu
tion. Members must take oath that
they believe in Jesus Christ and that
the Bible is the word of God. It be
lieves that every child should attend
the elementary public schools and
that parochial schools though wel
comed must not be in session when
public school is in session. It believes
that the public school is the bulwark
of civilization and the security pf
American ideals. It honors and re
spects the Stars and Stripes and true
Americanism. It believes in a single
standard of morality. It believes in
the separation of Church and State
and the freedom of speech and press.
Mr. Ora assailed unmercifully the
metropolitan press for its disregard
for facts and the truth. He cited the
expression of the press on new move
ments and showed how the facts and
conditions were distorted, misrepre
sented and sometimes buried or ignor
ed. He pleaded most effectively for
the purity of the home and for a
closer association of parents with
their children.
Mr. Ora pleaded for the Bible in
the public schools and in libraries
and urged everybody to read the won
derful Book. He stated that the or
ganization is opposed to mob action
and mob spirit. They advocate strict
racial lines and are opposed to inter
marriage of the White and Colored
races. He treated that subject from
a biological viewpoint also. “The
Klan has done more for the Negro
than any other organization,” he said,
“but we want the Negro to stay with
in his racial bounds.”
The meeting opened and closed with
prayer.—Fergus Falls Free Press.

DETROIT, MINN., WHOLESALER,
“SNORTS” WHEN FACTS ARE TOLD
“Irish” Riley and “Sidekicker” Eagen Ought to Read
Something Beside “The Sunday Visitor” When
Seeking Facts of History.
Detroit, Minn.—At a Ku Klux Klan
meeting held here, Friday of last
week, Michael Riley of the Detroit
Grocery Co. (Wholesalers) became so
“riled” when the editor of the Call of
North, P. J. Orn, presented facts per
taining to the parochial school and
the achievements of Protestantism,
that he jumped to his feet and shout
ed at the speaker, “You are giving us
nothing but damnable lies.” Know
ing from experience on a farm that a
calf will hang himself if given enough
rope, Mr. Orn let the hot headed K.
C. “rave on” for a time. Sure enough
Riley “opened his mouth and put his
feet in.” Straighway he admitted
that he was a Casey and more.
Then he wildly made a “weak-sisters”
effort to' “prove” somethings in favor
of the parochial, but failed most
tragically. One of Riley’s employees,
a salesman by the name of Eagen,
came to the assistance of his “boss.”
Eagen’s knowledge of history, how
ever, was even worse than that of
Riley s, if that could be possible, and
the “pair” made history “as inaccur
ately farfetched as “might wildmen
from the Solomon Islands. Riley be
gan to wax oratorical after the first
“pop-off” and paid tribute to Christ
opher Columbus as “the discover of
America.” The “Irisher” began to
feel his “oats,” and so gave the mis
information that “Lord Baltimore
wrote into the Constitution the part
which gives religious freedom to all
Americans.” Holy smoke of Prince
Albert, how some “birds” know “hist
ory wat ain’t history atall, atall.” It
was Eagen’s turn now.. The “feller”
on Riley’s payroll had a notion in his
“gizzard” and advanced the informa
tion that “revealed” an Irish woman
as Lief Ericson’s wife. Holy Saint
Jackass, what may we hear next.
Facts About Columbus
Let’s read accurate history for the
benefit of Riley and his fellow co
workers. Columbus (rightly named
Colon) discovered some islands in the
West Indies, but died thinking San
Salvador and other nearby islands
were off *he coast of Asia. Columbus
was not an Italian, but a Morano,
that is, a converted Jew. Lief Eric
son discovered North America, near
ly .500 years before Columbus set
sail on a voyage which he hoped
might result in the discovery of a
mew route to Asia. (Can’t help it
Riley, that’s history.)
Michael Riley Should Study History
Lord Baltimore (nor any of the
Baltimores) did not have anything to
do with the framing of our federal
Constitution. Riley says he did, we
insist he didn’t. If blusters and bel
lows could down historical facts Riley
could possibly make some believe that
he is right. The first Lord Baltimore
died in 1632 and the Cinstitution was
fromed in 1787—a hundred fifty-five
years after Lord Baltimore’s death.
(Tut, tut< Riley,, do we hear you
shout, “damnable lies?”) However,
it was evident that Riley wanted to
emphasize the word “toleration,” and,
jumping shades of the Hibernian con
vention, how sweetly “tolerant”
Riley spluttered. Eagen at this point
had to push a sentence into the tir
ade of his “meal-ticketer” so as to
make sure “barbs” aplenty were
twisted onto the anti-Klan whip-lash.
He said, “Baltimore, a Roman Catho
lic, was the first man in America to
grant religious freedom.” We don’t
know why this bit of historic inaccur
acy was offered—no, we don’t know.
Well, history shows that Lord Balti
more had been brought up a Protest
ant, and, it is very evident that his
early education made a deep impres
sion for he as a Catholic was tolerant.
Anyway read accurate history, Riley
—“Thirteen years before Lord Balti
more’'* act of toleration, Roger Will
iams founded Rhode Island on prin
ciples of religious toleration more
complete than those of the Maryland
Act, for the latter excluded Jews and
freethinkers.” (Can’t help it, Riley,
that’s accurate history.)
Out Of Their Own Mouths
Riley ran true to form. Oh, how
the men like “Mike” love Protestants
—yes, yes, Protestants.
Out of their own mouths we learn
ed how much Protestants are “loved”
by Riley’s crowd. Can’t you see why
Riley stuck his “nose” into the Klan
lecture when Mr. Orn had the plat
form by every right that is legal?
Michael Riley was a buttinsky, pure
and simple, and jumped to the floor
with a bellow, evidently hoping for
some anti-Klan activity on the part
of the many of his kind that attended
the Klan meeting at Detroit, Minne
sota. i.*i •.

Some Views Of Protestantism Ex-
pressed By Eminent Prelates
and Priests.
“Why I am a Catholic. It is be
cause the very perpetuity of this
great country depends upon its pro
fession of the Catholic faith. If this
country is to maintain the proud and
noble position it has already achiev
ed, such a happy result can be
brought about only by the profession
of the Catholic faith, and the practice
of Catholic principles,”—Priest T. F.
Coakley, in Michigan Catholic, Jan

“The most despicable thing outside
perdition is Protestantism; and to

“Cursed be those who assert liber
ty of conscience and of worship, and

“Protestantism has not, and never
can have, any right where Catholicity
has triumphed. Therefore, we waste
the breath we expend against bigotry
and intolerance and in favor of reli
gious liberty, or the right to be of
any religion that best pleases him.”

“The Pope is not only the repre
sentative of Jesus Christ, but he is
Jesus Christ Himself hidden under
the veil of the flesh. Does the Pope
speak. It is Jesus Christ who speaks.
Does the Pope accord a favor or pro
nounce an anathema? It is Jesus
Christ who pronounces the anathema
or accords the favor. So that when
the Pope speaks "fre have no business
to examine. We have only to obey.
We have no right to criticize his
direction or discuss his commands.
Therefore, everyone who would wear
the crown ought to submit himself to
Divine Right.”—“Archbishop of Ven

“As a religious system, Protest
antism is in a hopeless dissolution, is
utterly valueless as a doctrine or
moral power, and no longer to be con
sidered a foe with which we must
count. The Catholic Church is the
sole living and enduring Christian
authority.”—Archbishop Ireland.

Protestantism is not a religion—
never was a religion. The most that
could ever be said of it was that, it

the seven deadly sins in. We must
not forget that three-fourths of the
people of the United States are un

“What right has a Protestant
