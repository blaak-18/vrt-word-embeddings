.d The New Orleans Democrat "layed it
onto" the other city papers badly in her
a Ist September edition, and especially did
as her river reporter come out ahead bean
nt tithlly.
a. We clip the following from his section
ws relating to
.r- THE NEW ORLIANS AND RED RIVER TRANS
r PORTATION COMPANY.
This company was organized in the
spring of 1875. For the previous few
years the owners of boats engaged in the
n- Red river trade got nothing but disaster
,e and los in return for their labors. They
saw that the trade of North Loaisiana
and Texas was being diverted to other
cities, and that other than crude indivi
un dual efforts must be made to retain what
was already left to New Orleans of the
business of those sections. Hence the
organisation, which has realized all the
is expectations of its projectors, sad at the
same time greatly benefited the people
whom it serves. One of its Brat acsts was
'to place traveling agents in Texas to so
licit bnusiness and establish through rates
n. and bills of lading between all points
reached by the Texas and Pacific Rail
road and its connections in that State
and New Orleans. Rates during good
navigation were established between
is this eity and all important points in J
Texas, at an average of about one quarter I
lest than from St. Louis, which is oar
chief competitor, and the average 1
tr time from New Orleans about one day
Sles t bhan from St. Lonis to the ssme points.
The effects of all this soon began to he :
visible, and the eompany elaims that the
SITexas freight carried from here by their
IsI sonts during the past season more than
, doubles the quantity taken in any pre
vions seasons for years. In the single s
.article of salt alone, the company has
' during the past two seasons sold some a
w thinglike 75,000 oeks. Previously the c
greater portion of the salt for Texas had
been supplied from Galveston. When q
the number of ships required to bring
this quantity of salt to this port is con c
uidered, and the fact that each vessel
ex ends thoesands of dollars in one way It

Noeitj of tha North or Wes would t
have st quietly ndlhave seen the richl'

yet too late, and even if we were to have "

sr, of what may be done South with like

on and we certainly think their made of

ter ample we learn.
py Our farmers will admit that under the
nd present systemn of till,,ge a hale of cotton
it per acre, even upon our richest lands is a
as fair average yield, and are satisfied with
it. In this very particular we desire to
it see inlprovementa If ten acres of land
or can he made to produce twenty or more
Id hales, (and we assert that it can,) is it
u- not a waste of time, capital and labor to
work twenty acres which produce no
in more, and require double the amount of
force to cnltivate t
s- In Oeargia, where lands are not nat
nrally near an fertile as those of the Red
he River valley, cotton planting has ad
w vanced to a science, and from two and a
or half to four bales of cotton have been
y produced from one acre. If this be done
' in Georgia, why not in Louisiana ? Will
not some of our planters try it t And
t in trying it we would suggest they keep
re a correct secount of the manner of break
10 ing up, planting and cultivation, which
ewe will publish, in order that our farmer
le friends may benefit by their experienee.
s We see from intercourse with our farm
ers thathat they have no well defined sys
tem of corn cultivation, and to the end
that they may. educate themselves in
te that science we will publish the views of
d any farmer who will write us on the sub
o jees. Let as hear from the successful
ir corn planters!
r A miller, of Halliday, Illinols, who
e has lost many ogs bycholera, states that
y dry bran, slightly lted, is a good rem
. edy for it. If the hogs refuse to eat it,
o starve them until they do. Another i
i farmer claims that if hols are given
wr hat salt they need in a clean pasture,
n it will have the desired offect.
Every family fnds more or less bones
e accumulating. Burn them with your
wa ood, and the ashes thus enriched is one
of the most valuable of fertilisers. Money
connot buy any article which so enriches
d your soil. Bones thus consumed will c
n quadruple the value of wood ashes,
g which in themselves are the beat of soil a
Senrichers.
8beep's pelts can be twed anad not
I tanned. Tawlig is done by scraping the
I flesh side ofthe pelt eleau from all a ble
t or fat, then sprinkling it with a mitaure I
of finely powdered alum and salt in equal I
Spart. Two skins are then laid with the
lesh side together, or a single one don.
k bled lengthwise and tolledl up for a h
week or ten days; then opened, scraped
and washed and rubbed dry with a piece
of chalk, and worked and pulled until
the skin is soft.
On the subject of keeping eggs the fol.
lowis g has been contributed to a country
paper: "I would say the eggs could be
kept the year round. Pack them in a
box with oats (ends down), and nail a
r cover on nicely when full ; thea take
another box four incheslarger each way,
put about two inches of plastera the
bottom of this box and fill all around
and on the top with plaster, then put a
cover on this box sad put sway in a cool
place. Turn the box each alternate day."
fALL PLOwIao.
The better the preparation ofthe ground
the betterthe ersp. The high avsrae N
yield of the Lnglish farms Isno daoubt
largely due to the thoreugh preparation
of the ground before seedng. Our eli
mate l superior to that of England for
wheat growing; yet a yield of sixty-four
bashels per acre i not t a all infreqaeont
among farmesrs there, while here torty
*bushels per acre is an unuasl yied. Two
plowing, several harrowings, and inu
mrany eases, rolling and crushing, sad
the excellent preparation of the sil by
p revouons ot crop, must bhave a much
better effect upoa the soil than one plow- I
I ing. very poorly done, beease of the
bardness sd dryaes of oaur soil in mid
sumamer, and very imperf et barrowing. Tb
It might be well for us to lay oat more
labor on our wheat crop, and so prepalre
the groand better, and raise our average
from twelve to it least twenty baubshels
per aere. The diferease in th amunt
of wheat at bharvest waould pay or a m
goed dea of etra work in glowin, sete.,
Sand yet leae a proft; beside t soil
wouldi not forlget the generous treamat
in one year nor two.-St. Loais Er.
CANE OF PASTUIN.
Very many pastuaes i the West, es-I
pecially new ad thinly seeded ones, be
come overgrown late ina the summer with
weeds that have found a lodge.st. or
are left by stok. They are not only aun
sightly, brt if allowed to remain they H
continually reseed the land. When
them - ocar, a mower, better a reaper, 11
shounldbe rau over the land before they
heeou toonha, anrdd the whole taken
of when driead ad baorned. Weeds are
espeially found where the laud hasu been
sededl to timoathy and clover, the only
pasture we are sorry to ay in many
parts of th West. The reseon of this
