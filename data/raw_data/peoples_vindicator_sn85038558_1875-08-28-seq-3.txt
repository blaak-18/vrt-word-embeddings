T'1 ALB 191t:
TIHE ART JOURNAL OP AMERICA,
ISStUE'! MIONTIHLY.
"A Ma'gnifctcnt Conception, wonderfully
carried out."'
Tine lccessity of a popular medlimn for
the replresentation of the ptoductions of
our great artists,loas always been recog
nized, and imany attempts have been
made to meet the :tant. The successive
failht'es *Whelt so tuvaribly tollowed eA'h
attempt In this contitry to establlsh an
art journal, did not prove the indiffer
ence of the people of America to the
claims of high art. 8o soon as a proper
appreciatioi of the want and an ability
to meet it wets fltow*,, the public at
once tall'ed With enthusiatn to its sup
port, and the result was a grenat artistic
and commercial triumph-TiHE ALDINE.
TftH ALDINE, while isuted with all the
regularity, has none of the temporary or
timely interest characteristic of ordinary
periodicals. It fs ani elegant miscellany
of pure, light and gtaceful literature; and
a collection of pictures, the rarest speei
mens of at'fisfic skill, in black and white.
Although each succeeding number affords
a fresh pleasure to its friends, the real
value and beauty of the At.rINE will tie
most appreciated after it hausbeen bound
tp at the close of the year. While other
journals may claim superior cheapnless, as
compared with rn .als of a simflar class,
the AtLD~t is a unique and original con
coption-alone and unapproached-hso.
Intely without competition in price or
character. The possessor of a complete
volume cannot duplicate the qnantity of
fine paper and engravings iu any other
shape or number of volumes for ten times
its cost; amid then, there is the Chromo
besides!
National feature"'oft THE ALDINE
must he taken lin no narrow sense. True
art is cosmopolitan. While THE AL
DINE is a strictly American institution,
it does not contine itself entirely to the
reproduction of native art. Its mission
is to cultivate a broad and !appreciative
art taste, one that will discriminate only
on gronnds of intrinsic merit. Thus,
while placing before the patrons of THE
ALDINE, as a leading characteritic, the
productions of the most noted American
artists, attention will always be given to I
specimens from foreign masters, giving
subscribers all the pleasure and justrnq
tion obtainable from home or loteigu
sourcnies.
The artistic illustration of American
scenery,.original with THE ALDINE, is
pn important feature, and its magnificent
jilates are of a size more appropriate to
the satisfactory treatment of details
than can be afforded by any inferior
page. The jndicions interspersion of
landscape, marine, figure, and animal
subjects, sustain an unabated interest,
impossible where the scope of the work
uonfinet the artist too closely to a iingl
style of subject. The literature of THE
ALDINE is a light and gracefidul aceom
paniment, worthy of the artistic fen
aures, with only such technical disqrisi
lons as do not interfere with the popu
lar interest of the work.
Premium for 1975.
Every snbstriber for 1875 will receive
a beautiful portrait, in oil colors, of the
same noble dog whose picture in a for
ncr issue attracted so much attention,.
MAN'S8 YSEELFISI1 FRIEND"
will be a welcome in every home. Eve
ybody loves such a dog, and the portrait
a executed so trte to the life, that it
seems the veritable presence of the ani
nal itself. The Rev. T. Do Witt Tal-i
mage tells that his own Newfoundlhld
og (the finest in Brooklyn, barks at it!
.lthough so natural, no one who sees
this premium chromo will have the
slightest fear of being bitten.

The Saturday Evening Post.
The Oldest and lRist Story Pdper Pub
lished.
FoundedAugusnt 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Post haa been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever borne a
widespread and unblmtishel reputation
.orathe nnnprpsmed pnri~ty, rseoment
and excellence of the Serials, Sketches
and Misoellaneonus readiig matter.
It is pre-eminently
·The Best Family Paper
that Is published in thiscnontry, from its
never containing anythipg that would
offend the feelings of anyone, either in
a religions or political sense, or that
could not be read at any flireside without
objeetion from the most ftheidloes.
The circulation of the Satantay Even
ing Post, through not fuite so large
perhaps, as its younger contemporaries,
is not, like that of some of tlhen, fluctu
sting, and too oftenasbort-it-ed, but
SUIt, so8ID AitD SUSTANTIAT.
based upon the inutinaie meritof the pa
per itself and not depelmlent on any ex
traneous !intlnenes, nsuch as the populari
ty of individual writers, &e.
Good, however, as the Saturday Even
ing Post has been in the past, it is ouear
intention to make it still better in the
unture, and with this object in view we
will effect a marked inmprovement in eve
ry deparltment of the paper, and will
call to onr samiatanee writers of admitta
.ability and known repntation.
By increasing its former attra6tions,
and adding many jadiiouo mmn plse
ing novelties, by studying how to please
and cultivate the popular taste, by in
eressin; industry. em enterprise, ind by
enlarged facilities, we hope to atake new
kiends with each sand every isrne and
oantinue ·to maintain the elira td the
