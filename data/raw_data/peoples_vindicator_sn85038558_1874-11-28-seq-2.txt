A BIG BEAR DISCOVEIDI), IN ''A
: CANE-BRAKE.
TUNSUCcCiSsFUL lHUNfT FOR HIM.
One'day last week two colored men
were out choppling fire-wood in what
is known as Blanehard's Point, leis
urely bitting three licks and speaking
t¶n wsrds, when one of the tmen
tltinling, perhaps it was pbout twelve
o'clock, and casting his eyes heaven
ward to consult the 'sit'uhtion of the
sun as to that fact, was heard to ex
claim suddenly,. 1,y his cowupaiuou;
'fore God if dar is'nt a bar."
The' iforemeiitioned coWpdaniOn oet
heating thl:follpwed with, his eyes
the! direction o the spiaker, and he
soon discovered',s.big ugly looking
bear lazily reviewinig them frotmhis
elevated position rtp a tiree, and in
the. excitement of the moaueult,, ie
could but esolaim, "A bar," and then
thekeo'*aI no disenasion as to the 1iert
step to be ttaken by them,". 4 rr did
they stand upon the, order oftlieir
going1 but rthey went at once." Soon
afterivards they aroused thb neigh
hiorhood by the bear story, and all
determined "to, .go or him." Any
quantity ..of small dogs were put in
reqilsitiou asid all. the gnmis in. that
sectibn examinted as to their"bear
killing capacity.,
So much time was. consumed in
cleaning, greasing, and leading the
fire-aims, that it was thought best to
postpone the bunt until' next day,
whea tflw would certainly capture
the- wonder of the *oods. On the
following' morning'
"Up roso the sun o'dI nioore and 'iead,
Up robe with the sunt"--

ed by' their betr dogs. One hunter
a lile imore. ibrave than .te others,
having confidence in the speed,of his
horse, pursued the bear closely, calil
ing to a person, he saw at a distance
"head him !" a1?ead 'him!" ghere
qopn the person so addressed "head.

curred in New Orleans. The Empire,

5 ,o'clock . we heard a. great noise,
shoutiog. sce4aams, shrieks and, bell
ringing and running down the wharf
a short distance, we' sa tire cause,
the boat had gone down, the passen
gers, forty-four of whom were drowned
in their beds. The Captain of the
boat lost four children, seaing his
wife and one child, and thus it seems
Providence punished him for a crimi
nal s ud willful act in overloading his
boat' and even not discharging her
immediately upon her arrival in port.
you will see full particulars of .the
sad affair in the files I send to-day.
Our case.has not yet come up.- Our
attorneys yes4~ay bad an aiterview
with Woolfley, the commissioner,
and had a sight of the affidavit, which
was signed by one Smith said Vaen
Dumsan charging us with having en
tered into a conspiracy upon the 26th
day of August, 1874, to murder one
Dewees and Twitclell, at +or near
Coushatta, on the 29th of said
m o u t h. The affidavit embraced
the names of near seventy citizens, of
our patishl, heAded by Col. D. Pierson.
As yet, no movehas been made: to
force a trial, Col. Marr does not wish
us to do so, unless' Judge Durell ~as
in th cit y fii mfcli ii'eIilev cliild
be assured Jnstice. So yoliliP -'Du
roell makes some ..dinstinct between
a citizens and a State, he will destroy
a omoda nwealth without compunc
tion and protect a citizen with jbst~le.
At all events, we will not be surrend
ered by our bondsmen. unless assured
of a speedy trial,'which; with the pres
eat U. S. bench atd Beckwith to head
them, Col. Marr says most positively
we will never, have. The case has as
yet advance but one step, vis t "'we
have seen `tie 'daffl~t.:" '

As many parents are anxio;us to
their children taught drin-itg,
l $iseer's of Mercy have decided ol
olpeng a special ap artment at their
Convent, in which, flat, perspective,,
and geometrical drawing will be
taught to pupils, on the fdlowirn
terms:
For thlmce Bcssou a week of an hour
eaºci. ....................... .g0
For five lessons a week of an hour
each ........... .... ...5,0.
On the same termS,.the Sisters will
'tlso tea"h.fit'T"Ttldns of emibroieiry,
flo0wer-m jglge .4 trav-works.
Their charge fr music is $5.00 l
month. Ali for the ordinary courah
of tuition, inelumding sill ging in the
English; French and Latin languages
$M.00 per month.
The above refers only to the acade.
my attached to the Convent of Mercy.
As it has been rumored (to the
prejuadice of religion) that the labors
of the Sisters of Mercy in the eduea.
tion of the colored children, are conm
pulsory, I, in the name of the eom
aunity, beg to state, that such re.
port is' utterly false. We have wil.
lingly aiidtcheerfully offered ouselve,
to second the designs of our good
Hishop in the education and religious
triiningAof the eolored childkeo of his
cogregatilo, who,' from motives of
respect and .fideity to their religion,
refuse toy attend the Government
sehools. '
