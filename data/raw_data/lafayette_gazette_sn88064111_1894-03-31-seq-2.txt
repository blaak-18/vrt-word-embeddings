It is said that when Thomas B.

him "sissy." One day, the story thi
goes, while he was churning, some rol
of the boys stood around and guyed ex]
*"sissy." He finished his work, do
took off his apron and administered as
to them a sound thrashing. Need- so
less to say that this was the last the

PRIMARIES.
As the Democratic Eiecutive
'committee meets, to-day to devise
means to select a caijditate for re
S. presentative to fill the vacancy
,md caused by the resignation of Hon.
Sverton Cade, it might not be amiss
to present our views as to the best
- method.
A -Democratic primary election
,r is a sure way of reaching the wish of
•ns the voters, because every one who
'desireg to express his preference
does so individually by casting his
ballot for his choice after selecting
among the candidates in the field.
th He does not depend upon the action
of another, as in the case of a con
vention. He exercise his own judg
ment and forms his opinion from
.n his knowledge of the candidates,and 4
their position upon the issues that
- will present themselves for solution.
it The great hindrance to the efficacy
d of party organization is, that the
p~liticians will always endeavor to c
U capture and control it, without any I
e regard for the voice of the people.
z By "bossism" or "machine poli
tics"the politicians gain control of the I
organization and provide such
g methods to select candidates with
,r out consulting the wish of the peo
Y ple who are supposed to be repre
' sented by them. Sometimes
3 a convention is called for the
ostensible purpose of allowing the
n people to act, but often the result
e is that the very object aimed at is
t defeated.
The objection to a convention,
by those who desire to follow the c
a true principles of Democracy, are r
e manifold. Fur instance, under such c
e a method, the parish is divided and 1
subsided in certain portions; each r
portion is given the right to elect so
many delegates (according to the
number of voters there) to attend a (
convention aE a future day. Some e
of these precincts have more dele- e
gates than others. It often happens °
that some places are closely con- v
tested, while others are virtually
one-sided, giving a large majority I
on one side or the other. The re
sult is that the people have expressed C
their choice in no uncertain tones;
but this is done away with. The C
delegates from the closely contested
polls, although representing a I
minority when the whole vote of the
parish is considered align themselves v
by combinations and other political
tricks and vote as a unit on all ques- I
tions before the convention, and
with a majority of the delegates on C
the floor control the nomination and
pervert the will of the actual m a- C
j ;rity.
Primary election directly for the s<
candicates has been the uniform
rule in this parish since the Demo- n
cracy has been selecting its candi
dates through the party organization, di
and believing that the members of t
the executive committee are desi
rous of having the will of the people -
expressed and respected we have no
doubt that they will decide upon it
as the best method to adopt. By
so doing they will demonstrate that
they will not allow any tinkering with
the organization or give an entering
wedge to political machinations.
Henry Grady's Arraignment of
Whisky. c1
Tonight it enters a humble home
to strike the roses from a woman's
cheek, and tomorrow it challenges p
this republic in the halls of Congress. St;
Today it strikes a crust from the lips i,
of a starving child, and tomorrow it P
levies tribute from the government -
itself. There is no cottage humble
enough to escape it, no place strong tii
enough to shut it out. It defies the 'h
deo
law when it connot coerce sufferage. sta
It is flexible to cajole, but merciless cal
in victory.
It is the moral enemy of peace
and order; the despoiler of men and
terror of women, the cloud that
shadows the face of our children,
the demon that has dug more graves H
and sent more souls unshrived to
judgment than all the wars since 171
Joshua stood beyond Jericho. It
comes to ruin, and it shall profit
mainly by the ruin of your sons and wi
mine. It comes to misleads human Ju
souls and to crush human hearts an,
under its rumbling wheel It comes ha
to bring gray haired mothers down pi
in shame and sorrow to their graves. La
It comes to stifle all the music of
our home and fill it with silence and '
desolation. It comes to change the
wife's love into despair and her et
pride into shame. It comes to still ish
the laughter on the lips of little d
children. It comes to ruin your
body and mind to wreck your home, of
gnd it knows it must measure its of
prosperity by the swiftness and te
certainty with which it wrecks this a
world. eig

A Strange Story.
Felix Steiner is the name of a man who Th
has recently dtsappeared, and it is thought be
that he has committed suicide. His story is a
a sad one, and one of the strangest on record. A
He was divorced from his wife in 1873,
the woman taking their only child, a daugh
ter, and going into retirement. She changed
her qpme, hoping to blot out the past by so
doing.
Se YVrs afterwards her husband that was
e- fel-in love with a. beautiful young girl, and
;y was married to her.
M. After the wedding he told her the story of
his life. She was equally communicative
and told him her story.
st Steiner heard the tale, said nothing, but
quietly disappeared.
in He had married his own daughter.
-f How Much Rain Will Fall ?
The Weekly Courier-Journal has struck a
popular note in its weather guessing contests.
A wonderful amount of interest was taken in
is its offer of $I,ooa for the closest guesses to
ig the coldest day and temperature auiing Feb
i. ruary, at Louisville, and much valuable in- .
n formation was gathered by subscribers on the
subject. This contest has just been decided,
there being twenty-eight lucky guessers.
The Weekly Courier-Journal now makes
n another offer on the same line. For the
d closest guesses to the amount of rain that will
Lt fall at Louisville during the month of May, I
the Weekly Courier-Journal will give $1,ooo. i
This money will be devided into nineteen r
Y presents-one of $5oo, two of $0oo each, two
e of $5o each, four of $25 each, and ten of $to
o each. Each guess must be accompanied by
S$, to pay for one year's subscription to the
Weekly Courier-Journal, the best Democratic
paper published. The rain-fall is scienti
fically measured, to the hundredth part of an
e inch. The heaviest rain-fall in May during s
the past twenty years was seven inches and
forth-six hundredths of an inch. The lightest
was one inch even. The measurements are
made by the Government officials of the
Welther Bureau at Louisville. Sample f
copies of the paper with full particulars of
the contest, will be sent free to any address.
Write at once, as under no circumstances h
e will any guesses be received after April 30.
