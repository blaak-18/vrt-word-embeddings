Old Whigs.
It is not uncommon in these days
of political talk, to hear men say that
they are not Democrats, but Old Line
Whigs! Wonder if they have ever
thought how perfectly ridiculous and
absurd such an expression is I How
can a man at this present time be an
"Old Whig ;" he had better say at
once, and we think lie would come
nearer the mark, that lie was and
"'4111 fossil." What in the name of
all that is good, can old Whigism
have to do with the living issues of
the age I Their doctrines might have
been good, they may have been bad,
but, whether the one or the other, it
has no more to do with the present
contest, than the controversy over
the meaning of the. hieroglyphlcs on
thie Egyptian pyramids.
Who cares any thing about what
was taught and believed by the men
of the passed generation, unless it
be to take guidance by some wise act
or word left by them, as sign-posts
on the high road of life. It is possi
tively unbearable to hear a man sit
down and talk of being "an old
Whig," and feeling no interest in the
present contest from that fact alone.
In the first place why was lie a
Whig! Is a political party in these
United States such an entirety, that a
man can become so thoroughly im
bued with its principles as to partake
of its doctrince to such an extent that
lie will become inocculated, and act
as.he may ever afterwards, this prin
ciple, like vaccination, will remain
in his system, protecting hiiln from
any thing like intillectnal progress,
or political advancement? The ma
jority of 'systems will outlive the
very best vaccination, and to insure
immunity, they have to nndergo re
vaccination, and this must be re
peated from time to time, for fear
they are not properly protected, but
in the case of the "old whig," it ap
pears le has got it for life, and no
renewal of the operation is at all
necessary for his case.
The proof of this thing is that the
Radicals in this State presuming on
the known weakness of "old whigs,"
have been coquetting with them, and
attempting to lead them to join their
ranks. Here is what the Mansfield
Reporter of the 13th inst., says: "We
are in receipt of a pamphlet address
ed to the old whigs of Louisiana, by
Mr. J. R. G. Pitkin, Corresponding
Secretary of the Republican State
Central Committee. We presume
this campaign document has been
sent throughout the State, and is an
appeal to the old Whigs of the State,
to unite with the Republieans in the
coming contest. We propose giving
a few plain reasons why this appeal
will fall still-born upon them, and
we dirso, because we were one of the
old faith ourselves. Mr. Pitkin is
wasting his eloquence and sweetness
on the desert air." And then the Edi
tor proceeds to give those good and
sufficient reasons why the "old
Whigs" cannot join Radicalism in
this State, in the coming contest.
This places the Reporter positively
under the Democratic-Conservative
banner for the campaign, and those
who hoped to class it as independent
or doubtful, will find themselves mis
taken.
The Reporter is now doing noble
work in the cause of the intelligent
and honest people of the State, and
is determined to assist in redeeming
her from her present troubles.
Farmers wishing information on
the subject of tanning leather in Cali
fornia, will find valuable hints in a
paper published by. the authority of
the Secretary of War. Ordinance
Notes, No. LII, Washington, May
2nd, 1876.
There, will be found all the particu
lars minutely described by Lieut. D
A. Lyle, U. S. A., trom aetual obser
vation at the tanneries. There Js no
good reason why this branch of in
dustry shlould not be persued here in
this country, as profitably as any
where in the world, for here, every
thling can be found necessary, and in
the greatest abundance.
These papers can be had by ap
plication to the War Department, for
they have been printed for general
distribution and information. The
success of any undertaking -in life
mainly dependa upon two things,
viz: The proper remuneratioo, and
the pleasure afforded to thie one en
gaged in the business; and to accom
plish these ends it is absolutely es
sential to intelligibly understand tihe
umodw operandi of all the different
bhanches of any particular enter
prise.
If any one will read these notes
carefully and undeistandinogly, lie
will cprtainly know more about tihe
tanning business than hie did before,
however perfect he may have con
:sidered himself in theart. Hides in
this country, like cotton, are ship
ped at great expense, and to long
distances, there manufactured into
either shoes or leather, and brought
back to us and sol at great progt,
when it we would only exhibit
the least particle of enterprise, all
this could be avoided and as good
leather, boots and shoes, made right
here at our very doors, as are made
in any other plade` on the eontioo6t.

The Judgment Creditors.
The parties to whom the parish of
Natchitoches is indebted, whether
justly or unjustly lltust look to the
Courts for final adjustment and set
tlement of their claims, and the at
tempt to lug this question into the
present canvass, as belonging to it, is
simply absurd, and bears falsehood
on its face, and stamps those engaged
in trying to do such a thing as ma
licions falsiflers, and not entitled to
belief in any commtunity of respecta
ble people. What has the Judgment
Tax to do with the political issues
presented to the people of this parish,
this yrear Does it enter into any
part of the subject matter for their
consideration 1 Does any one pro
pose to discuss this sublject, which
alone the Courts can decide? Is it
an apposite question to be settled by
disputation before the people, in a
great and impol taut election like
un ii to the one we are preparing for t
FIor what have Courts been created,
if not to take cognizance of just such
vexed and complicated aflftairs as the
onel above ?
This attempt of the Radical leaders
to interject this Judgment Tax busi
ness into the canvass for the purpose
of dividing our peoplle will prove a
very vain and futile movement, and
will in no way lead our people from
the track of their vile deeds, but on
the contrary, lmust make them more
determined than ever, to put such
men where they will be forever pow
erless for harm again.
There is not a single honest judg
ment holder in this Iarish, who is not
perfectly willing to submit his claiml
to the arbitration of the Courts, and
abide their decision, annl whether
such decision may be for, or against
him, lie will quietly submit as a good
and law-abiding citizen should.
Therefore, it is a slander upon the
intelligent voters of this parish, for
these Radical harpies to endeavor
to get up this discussion in order to
excite the people of the country,
against a few gentlemen here in town,
who happen to be Judgment-holders;
but we say to them now, and time
will prove our prediction to be true,
that they are mistaken in the feel
ings and temper of the people, and
more interesting questions than the
Judgment Tax have to be settled,
before any each extraneous matters
can be forced upon the attention of
those so deeply and vitally concerned
in the triumph of our cause.
Amusements.
It is very natural for the human
mind, however constituted, to seek
amusement of some kind occasignal
iy, and this proclivity is more es
pecially peculiar to the young and
joyoeus youths, who have little to re
strain them in their waywardness and
ftrolicsome notions. That which
amuses and causes laughter for the
moment is readily undertaken by
them, and often an amount of labor
accomplished, which, if required of
them as frnitfol employment, would
be unhesitatingly refused. Different
beings require different entertain
ment for the mind, and in the matter
of pleasuMrable occupation one will
commnuit this folly, while another will
play that prank, which is best calco
lated for the time being to afford him
the greatest amount of sport. This
has been fully exemplified within the
last week in our town to a character
istic extent; sonme have been amu
sing themselves at night by blocka
ding the streets with all kinds of
lumber and rubbish, that could be
Sfound, no doubt, to -the great disgust
Sof those early walkers and drivers,
whose duties or necessities called
them forth;c others again have amus
ed themselves by placards and cari
catures, posted in various public
places, and have been considerably
amused, no doubt, by the aptness of
their representations, and the unex
pressed chagrin of those to whom the
ridiculous and grotesque pictures
were at all applicable; others again
have felt their marshal spirits arous
ed, and have given expression to it
by congregating on the commons and
undergoing the military drill, and in
all probability, derived their share of
amusement therefrmn.
Now, all these thiings are harmless
in themselves, amid provided, no one
is injured in person or ,. property, or
seriously incommoded in their daily
avocations, we can see no reason lwhy
individuals should not indulge, to
their hearts content, in these inno?
cent diversions. In all these things
a decent respect and thoughltful con.
sideration, should be paid to the mor
I al tendency of such pastimes, and if
at any time there is danger that they
may be carried to far, then it will be
becoming on the part of participants
to seriously refleet, whether or not
there is likelihood of the "games of
sport" ending in "frays of blood,"
and if there can be aroused any such
suspicion, then they should be given
up, and more innocent and less has
ardous recreations engaged ro, during
these times of such extraordinary
developments.

A 1.o000oo MURDER.
TIIOMAS BEAN ALLEGEI) TO RIE THE
ASSASSIN OF TWITCIHELL AND) KING AT
COUSHATTA.
From an officer of the steamer C.
HI. )Unrfee which reached here from
Red River on Tuesday, it is learned
that Senator Twitchell, who, with
one King was shot at Coushatta a few
days ago, charges the commission of
the crime upon Thomas Bean, who,
it will be recollected, was connected
in the spiriting away of the election
returns of one of the polls of DeSoto
parish in 1874, when Twitchell and
Elain, were contestants for the State
Senatorship from thlat district.
The Times' informant states that,
according to Tivitehell's story, the
latter promissed Be:lln a thousand
dotllars for the service of suppressing
the returns, but that this money hoe
subsequently refused to pay, on the
ground that Bean had failed to per
foirmi the task according to the strict
letter of the contlact. Twitchell
says that, failing to obtainl the money,
Bean threatened to kill him, and this
threat--although not sought to be ef
fected during a nlapse of three years
-clhninrated in the shooting of him
self and King.
It is said that the assassin used a
Henry rifle-a sixteen shoter-and
not only emptied it at his victims, but
also emptied his revolver, firing
twenty-two shots in all.
Directly after the shooting, and es
cape of the-shooter, the sheriff organ
ized a n0iRee'and started in pIursuit,
but after proceeding about three
miles abandoned the chase, on the
plea that to take the mtan would be
certain der.th for somebody, and he
did't think it would pay. At last
accounts the assassin was still at large.
The above is taken from the New
Orleans limes of the 10th inst. :
And now after our people have
been abused and villified, all the Rad
ical papers throughout the United
States detailing in the most outrage
ous manner the killing of King and
the wounding of Twitchell, setting
forth how they were the victims of
Southern malice and proscriptive
hate, arousing all the bitter feelings
possible against us; the New Orleans
Republican, howling as if mad, over
the White League assassination in
Coushatta, the Chicago Inter-Ocean
eatehing uir and re-echoing the cry,
and all the other lesser lights follow
ing in the train, it turns out that the
main who did the work was one of
his own gang of thieves, from whom
Twitchell had withheld promised re
ward for some dirty work performed
two years ago to insure hie (Twitchell)
seat in the State Senate. We all re
f memeniber the DeSoto election re
turns difficulty,. and how tite waman
having them in possession wanted one
thousand dollars before she wookl
give them tip. This is the price
Twitchell agreed to pay Bean for
withholding them, but after he found
out the Returning Board could man
age his case regardless of returns, he
Sturns his back on hris "pal" and re
fasesto pa him the snum agreed upon
for his raseality. Whereupon the
I said Bean swears eternml vetgeance
, against Twitchell and waits his op
Sportunity.
What a tale of dark deeds and bloody
f acts Twitchlell could unfold before tile
SCongressional Investigating Commit
t tee if ie was pat on the witness stand
and made to tell all he knows about
r his transactions in and around Con.
Sshatta for the last five or six years.
SAnd since the demand has been made
by a Republican member of Congress,
SMcDougall, of New York, that a full
Sinvestigation of the outrage should be
Shad, and the HIon. Wm. II. Levy on
bechalf of the people of thtis section,
insista.thatit should be done, we
hope for tire good name of our people,
tthat the Committee will spare no
Spains in getting to the "bottom facts"
t in the case,'and if they do not uneartlh
, things that will astonish every one
Shaving any respect for decency and
propriety then we are mighttly mista
ken in regard to tire misdeeds of this
Sman Twitchell and his co-adjntore in
Red River parish.
'f The people of the United States
w-ill not remain ignorant of these
SI thilgs this year, for all parties will be
i on the alert to hear the news from the
SSouth, and light must shine on these
dark corners, which have been so
.[long shaded ~by professed rogues
Sand accomplished thieves. They must
Sknow and understand how we have
,g been plundered by men who were all
the time sending forth word of our
Sdisloysaty ad ~exeiting the bittetest
• feelings of animosity againslt us, that
r they might plunder as the more. We
think it very fortunate for our people
that the Gibson Committee will soon
. begin its labors in thlis State, and that
this particular ease will be called up
before them, mor certainly our people
have nothing to fear from a free in
vestigation of every thing connected
with this whole affair.
SThrough the kindness of Ja. A.
Gresham, Bookseller and Stationer,
No. 92 Camp Street, New Orleans,
we received Daniel Dennett's work,
entitled "Louisiana As It Is." We
have not had tire time to read it
through, but glancing over its pages,
we find he has classed Natolditoches
patisla as one of thle "Piny woods
Sparishes," and nothing extra in that
classlifation. No doubt the work is
very aceaurate in regard to Sounthern
SLouisiana, but when he calls Natehi
toehes a "pinoey woods parish," we
are at once seized with the idea that
t hedoes not know what be is writing
abaot, and would advise him to make
a trip through this seetion of constry,
isad rewrite this part of his other
wae, ltttecesrlatv book.
More Radical Rascality !
The Records of the Court Pur
loined!
LET NO GUILTY MAN BE PUNISHED!
The District Attorney, J. Ml. B.
Tucker, looking over the records of
the Court, in the Clerk's Office, was
made aware of the fact, that the in
dictments against Van Dusen, II. C.
Myers, and fifteen others, had been
feloniously abstracted from the of
fice, and no account could be given of
their whereabouts!
District Court is to begin here next
month, and these worthies have ta
ken this step to escape legal conse
quences, of which they stand in some
dread. The disappearance of these
indictments are not fatal to the pros
ecution, we presume, and it is to be
hoped that the officers of the law
will put them to the benefit of a vig
orous criminal suit.
Judge Chaplin should remove the
incompetent Clerk, and appoint some
one who will do his duty according to
the oath of office taken on assuming
its functions.
Weather and Crops.
This week has been rather favora
ble for our planters, and they have
been busy "scraping cotton" and get
ting rid of the troublesome grasses.
The weather has been warnm and clou
dy most of the week, the .ind stand
ing from the rain quarter, (South
East) but up to present writing, we
have had no rain worth mentioning,
only an occasional shower now and
then, not sufficient to stop work in
the field.
The stand of corn and cotton
throughout the parish, is reported
goiod, laborers working well, com
plaining of hard times, and thorough
ly determined to make a crop, polli
ties to the contrary, notwithstanding.
We have really flattering prospects,
almost a good crop in sight, and
Louisiana certain to be redeemed
from Radical rascals this fall! what
more could human beings ask for, to
cause them to celebrate joyfully, the
Centennial T
Let no Northern man be deterred
from going South by the partisan hue
and cry of Southern hate and intol
erance toward Yankees. This is one
of the devil's own slanders. Nothing
promises such immediate aid, to the
depressed South as the influx of
Northern energy and Northern capital.
This is perfectly understood and
freely acknowledged. Every intelli
gent person you meet and all the
leading journals in the South are vy
ing with one another, each in his
special way, to encourage immigra
tirn. They do not want Northern
politicians to come down there and
run their State and municipal gov
ernments, but they do want working
and business men fromn the North to
settle among them. All such are
sure of a cordial welcome. I ant
quite inclined to think that farmers
ma:,y do hetter to go South than to go
West; hence I send this brief state
ment, founded on personal observa
tion. No one has employed the wri
ter to say or not to say anythfuing
whatever concerning time South or its
people, and hie has not the slightest
interest, except that of having the
facts known. J. S. PATTERSON,
Erie County, Ohio.
The above is an extract from a cor
respondence of the Loumville Coi
rier-Journal, and speaks the plain
truth. Let Northern men read it,
and if they will come among us, they
will soon find out how much we have
been villified and traduced by dl.s
honest place-seekers, political bum
mers, and thieving carpet-baggers.

TIHE COTTON BUREAC.
An attempt is being made to inves
tigate the Bureau of Captured and
Abandoned Property," in the Treas
ury Department, and should it prove
even moderately successfil, there iaust
come therefrom what even in ordina
ry times woul dbe called "astounding
disclosures," Ibt what, in these (ldays,
will only add more names to the
thieves' catalogue, and more portraits
to the Rogues' Gallery. Rotten as
was the Internal Revenue Department
with Whisky Ring rascality, it is i
doubtfull it it approached the measure I
of that which was perpetrated under i
cover of picking up captured and I
abandoned property, by which men,
with permits, traversed the South, I
with car and steamboat, and wagon,
and earried off hundlteds of millions
worth of cotton, and other things be
longing to I iivate parties. Tlhere is
one Camp who ought to be called be- :
fore that committee, if he has not o
been-a man who had permits to l
bring cotton and tobacco through-
who made it $400 ,0tl haul of the
latter in Arkansas, in which it is said
an Assistant Secretary of the Treas. I
uiry had ia third interest, and a prom- 4
inant railroad man ill Ialtimore, now
deceased, another third. If Treasury t
officials were partners of the agents,
it may readily be inferred that the
temptation to wrong doing was strong;
and when a man on $3,500 a year I
salary manages to save several hun- i
tired thousand dollars in a few years, f
the world is apt to think that lie
has either "struck a Bonanza," or has I
been very econamical. It is also said t
that a proprietor of a Washington
newspaper managed, as chief clerk
of that Cotton Bureau, to amass a
large sum through the skillful man- c
ipulations of one of the proprietors of r
Willard's Ifotel, who roped in the I
claimants and secured the diry.
TRICKS OF TRADERS.
It is a pity that the bill of Mr. Par
sons, of Kentucky, to regulate com.
merce among the States has not been
pushed through Congress yet by the
appropriate committee. It was an
efolrt to correct tihe rascalities of
traders which lie at the basis of the
general demoralization of the country.
The trading politicians are the tit re
presentatives of the trading popula
tion. What with scant measures.
short weight, adulteration, and tl e
like, the people are cheated in every
thing they buy. Mr. Parson's bill
required the use of standard articles
and full weight and measure, inflict
ing penalties for fraud in either.
While we are trying to reform the
country, and make the politicians
honest, let us also try to make their
constituents honest, by reforming the
morals of trade.
POLITICAL.
The Northern Republicans, how
ever willing to-subject the intelh
gence, culture, and all that is good in
the South to the domination of car
pet-bag thieves and ignorant negros,
have still among themselves a decent
regard for public opinion, and are
becoming generally ashamed of their
party nlallgement. Hence, they
have organized a reform Club in Boa
ton, and now New York follows snit.
There has been a secession of ich
respectability from the Union League
Club, and an address to the public
calling for the formation of a Repub
liean lReform Club, signed by Judge
Ernott, Hlon. W. E. Dodlge, Johni
Jacob Astor, Isaacn Shlernman, A. A.
Low, and a long list of others equal
ly proinllent names. Although these
men think a legislature of negro field
hands, a majority of whomi cannot
read, and never handled ten dollars
at a time in their lives before their
election, good enough for a Southern
State, they want what they call
gentleman for home iule and person
al association. So they take a crack
at Conkling, Morton, Blaine & Co. in
I the following neat style by resolving
"To signalize the opemung of the new
century of our nationaul existence by
having noeainated by the Repulblican
party for Vresident not a mere political
partisan, but a statesman of tried clar
acter, in sympathy with the best senti
ments of the people on all public ques
tions, conversant with the affairs of gov
ernment, discriminating and independent
in the choice of public servants, one who
will thoroughly reform the public ser
vice, and whose name alone will be a
guaranty ofofficial integrity, of wise and
prndent administration, and of fearless
enforcement ofthe laws."
t So they are getting sick of Grant
ism, at last, althionghl they have cod
died the President. drunk or sober,
and, to be near him, have abased
3 themselves before him and associated
Swith low fellows like Tom Murphy,
and his gang. But Jayne and Butler
were too much for Dodge and res
pectability. How would they like a
black carpet-bagger as collector of
Boston or New York This move.
ment is opposed to the Custom House
Ring and Conkling, and is suppposed
to be in sympathy with the call of
Bryansot, Schiur and Woolsey for the
15th inst. Mr. Bryant's paper, the
Evetnig Post says the conference
"designates Bristow, or Evarts, or
Adams as plainly as ever sign post
at a cross road designates the way to
I town. It does not designate Conkling,
Morton or any other mere politician.
If Cincinnati puts forward a name
worthy of the Centennial year, they
will support it; but if it does not,
then they will look elsewhere for a
Sstandard bearer." This means bus
iness.
Judge Blair's letter appears to have
produced a great impression in Mary
land, and the Baltimaore Auerican ex
presses its surprise at the unanimity
of thIe country press in indorsin; Mr.
Blair's views, and thinks that with so
much growing strength .all over the
ceountry, Tilden will be likely to ear
ry off the prize at St. Louis. There
seems to be little doubt of it. Tilden
is gaining in strength every day. lHe
is a man who will bear talking about.
THE CONNECTICUT SENATOIISIIP.

Barnum will be the successor of Sen

most valuable member of the Senate.
He has been long considered one of
the most indefatigable work 're in the
House. A man of wealth and high
social position, lie has no interests to
serve except those of his constituents.
His valuable serviees to the Demo
