lish all offers lor tlie sale of lauds
ou easy and favorable terms to
white immigrants freeof any charge
to the land owner, "no sale, no pay"
lias met with a response from our
public spirited fellow citizen, Mr,
Hobt. W. Bringhurst, who adver
tises three hundred and odd acres
for sale at $ G 00 per acre Cash, or
$7 00 on one and two years credit
This is the right spirit, and if our
large land owners who have thou
sands of acres of uncultivated open
laud will follow Mr. Bringhurst's
example, we are confident that we
will very soon have a population
here which besides increasing the
quantity and value of our staple
products, wili forever settle the po
litical status of Rapides.- Wo in
tend to follow this matter up until
we awawen an interest iu the sub
ject if it takes us all the year. It
is a question of too much impor
tance to the welfare of our parish
to be lightly passed over, and we
beseech our land owners to give it
the atteution it deserves.
Senu in your advertisements
gentlemen ! We will keep no ac
counts against you and unless we
secure a sale tor the land or lease,
wo will make no charge at all. If
we succeed in doing either, we
shall exact only our regular and le
gitimate rates for advertising. We
take all the risks. Send them i n !

Those enterprising merchants are
out in our issue of to-day with an
advertisement which informs the
citizens of Rapides and all the world
that they have on hand allow and
elegant stack of Jewelry, Silverware
Notions, &c., which they have just
opened to be ready for Christmas.
A visit to their elegant store in Lev
in's Brick How, Front Street, will re
veal the fact that they have really a
most handsome Btock on hand.
They can suit the most fastidious of
tastes and sell goods on reasonable
terms. These gentlemen are public
spirited and alive to the business
wants of our community, and have
selected their goods with a great
deal of care. Parents and others
who propose to make nice Christ
mas presents should at once give
Messrs Ferguson & Schnack a call
while they can select from the whole
stock.
M bs E. S. Hetherwick 's Store
—Mr. Duke returned on Monday
from New Orleans and brought up
with him a full, new aud complete
stock of everything iu the Dry
Goods, Grocery and Hardware
lines which he is uow opening and
otiers for sale cheaper than any of
the other merchants can sell tor,
as ho purchased his goods for con
siderably less than they did. There
will be a perfect rush for these
goods and Mr. Duke has the ad
vantage of the other merchants be
cause he has the only new stock in
town. We refer our readers to the
advertisement under its appropri
ate head and we advise our lady
fiiends to give Mr. Duke an early
call so as to have the choice of all
the new and pretty goods which
nre now exposed for sale on his
shelves. Mr Duke proposes to sell
cheap and to exact cash payment.

THE POLITICAL OUTLOOEM
The Returning Board have at
last completed the count of the city
vote aud we see it promulgated.—
They have counted it fairly and so
far their acts are satisfactory. Our
latest advices which we give else
where from Tuesday evening's Bid
letin inform us that they were on
that day just ready to take up the
vote of the parishes in their alpha
betical order, the returns of Ascen
sion parish being then before them.
We leave New Orleans with nearly
thirteen thousand majority iu our
favor. It the returns from the
country parishes are honestly made
up the radical majority in the coun
try will be only about eight thou
sand leaving us a clear majority in
the whole State of about five thou
sand. The evident purpose of the
Board was to delay the count until
after the assembling of Congress on
the first Monday in December.
The fact that they refused to en
tertain technical objections to the
returns from some of the Wards in
New Orleans, although they were
strongly pressed to do so by their,
own side, would seem to indicate au
intention on their part to act fairly.
It will not do, however, tor us to
rely upon any such seeming dispo
sition of theirs, nor should the fair
ness of the count of the city vote
lull us into any fancied se
eurity. It was intimated some
time ago that there would be an
honest count of the city vote and
that they would reserve their fraud
ulent practices for the country par
ishes. If our friends in New Or
leans abate one bit of their sleep
less vigilance, now that they have
come through the mill safely, we
will most certainly be defrauded in
the country. We are assured that
there is no danger of their losing
their interest in the doings of the
Board, and the pledge of the city
officers elect, not to take their offi
ces until the whole vote shall have
been counted was in the proper
spirit and proves that the men of
New Orleans are made of the right
sort of stuff.
They will stand by us undoubt
edly, but the country people should
not leave it entirely to them. Eve
ry parish in the State should have
representatives in New Orleans
right now to keep the gentlemen
!
right now to keep the gentlemen
composing the Committee acting
tor us informed as to the details of
the election in each parish. There
may be sprung upon them ques
tions which without the knowledge
of local affairs in every parish they
would not be prepared to meet. To
illustrate, they might not know if
they were confronted with the
charge of intimidation in Rapides,
that a company ofU. S. Soldiers
was on the day of election camped
iu our Court House yard all around
the ballot box of this precint, that
squads of soldiers were at Cheney -
ville, Lecomte and Cotilo where
the heavy negro vote was polled
and they might not be so well vers
ed as our honorable representative
on the Board, in the locality, com
plexion, distance etc., of the other
boxes. As in alphabetical order
the name of our parish comes rath
er low down on the list it is not too
late for us to send down some rep
resentative whose duty it shall be
to watch the count of Rapides.—
We apply here the favorite maxim
of our friend the Democrat. "When
you dance with a bear, keep your
eye on your partner."
It is intimated that their advices
from Washington are far from sat
isfactory to the Radicals, having
staring them in the face their
recent tremendous defeats in the
North; with an opposition House
in Congress coining iu on the 4th
ot March it is hardly probable that
they will make any serious attempt
to swindle ns out of victory in the
State. A just fate has at last over
taken this party of fraud, corrup
tion, contempt for law and defiance
to the will of the people aud its
day of plunder is over. Louisiana,
free and redeemed is prepared to
enter upon the career of prosperity
which awaits her aud after a long,
dreary night she hails with joy the
breaking ot the clear, bright and
sunny day that heralds her future
wealth and influence.

9 Returning Board.
This body unknown to our laws
under the good old system before
it was thought possible to swindle
the people of their voice in their
government, are at work compiling
the returns. They have completed
the count of New Orleans aud their
figures agree with those already
published by ns, as claimed by our
side, «and foot up a majority for our
side of about 13000. The count
thus far has been fair, but there is
a general impression that they will
not be equally fair in the count of
the country parishes. Extensive
frauds have already been perpetra
ted in the returns from some of the
parishes, notably in Carroll. At
tempts to doctor the returns from
some of the other parishes have
been made by outside parties who
were caught in the act and arrest
ed. Our city friends are wide
awake and they are keeping a close
watch upon and scrutinizing all the
acts of the Board.
On dit has it, we know not how
truly, that judications front Wash
ington do not suit the radicals and
that it lias been plainly intimated
to them that they must take care
of themselves. The fact that Gen.
Emory was asked from Washing
ton whether he thought it safe to
withdraw the troops from Louisia
na would rather go to verify the ru
mor. Without strong assurances
of help from Grant aud Williams,
we do not think the Returning
Board will dare to attempt to swin
dle us out of our victory by count
ing us out. If it should be true
that "the powers that be" at
Washington have turned their
backs upon Kellogg and Packard
we may reasonably expect a fair
count all over the State.
We had a fair election and won,
and now we are resolved to have
an honest count or make things
lively for such defeated candidates
as may attempt to usurp the places
for which they kuow they were
fairly beaten. As far as Rapides
is concerned the Board a d Kellogg
may save themselves the trouble of
counting in DeLacy, Cor.aughton.
Sullivan, Clements & Co., for the
people of this parish are resolved
not only that they shall not exer
eise the functions of the oil ices for
which they ran, and were fairly
beaten, but that our candidates
who were honestly elected shall
have their offices.
Geo . P. Rowell & Co.—This
Advertising Agency, 41 Park Row,
New York City, do a large business,
are the most enterprising of all the
Agencies in the United States, and
are thoroughly reliable in all their
business transactions. Rowell's
Reporter published weekly by them
is a welcome visitor to every print
ing office aud their Amytal News
paper Directory, is a marvel in the
way of neat and elegant printing,
besides being invaluable to all who
advertise. Our relations with them
for the year past have been highly
satisfactory to us and we most
heartily commend them to all who
have need of the services of a first
class, reliable Advertising Agency.
Iu another column will be
found the advertisement of Mr. A.
G. Thompson, who will open a day
school on Monday next at Dr. St.
John's school house.
We commend Mr. Thompson to
our citizens who have boys to send
to school as an efficient teacher and
thoroughly educated gentleman,
aud hope tlifft they will patronize
him. We are sadly in need of a
first class permanent school and
Mr. Thompson proposes to supply
the want.
The Survey of the upper and
lower Ealls under the appropriation
of Congress was completed some
time ago, and we may confidently
expect Congress at its approaching
session to order the building of
suitable works to throw the force
of the water from off the Alexan
dria front. Unless some such ac
tion is taken soon the whole of
Front Street will wash away.

RAPIDES.
its CLIMATE, FRUIT, VEGITABLES.
We are favorably situated as re
gards climate. Our Summers are
not generally too hot nor are our
Winters too cold. For a short time
during the Summer it is oppressive
ly hot, but it does not last longer
than two or three weeks. In Win
ter it sometimes snows and freezes,
but as a general thing our Winters
are mild. Such tropical fruits as
the banana, orange and japan plum
do not come to perfection here, al
though tiie trees grow* finely. The
early frosts generally kill the fruit.
Apples, peaches, plums, pears and
etc., grow here to the greatest per
fection. We have all varieties of
vegitables and grow them here as
fine as they can be grown any
where. £Our cabbages, tomatoes,
egg plants, turnips, aitichokes, on
ions, beets, radishes, beans, peas
etc., can not be beat anywhere.—
In the berries w% have wild the
blackberry and dewberry, and cul
tivate the strawberry and raspber
ry which can not be excelled any
where in the world. The hardy
varieties of the grape flourish luxu
riantly and come to full perfection
on our pine hills and the culture of
the grape may yet be as important
a crop as that of sugar and cotton.
Au industrious, enterprising man
can buy pinewoods lands at from
$2.00 to $3.00 an acre and by cul
tivating grapes can make a fortune

a years.
pasturage, grasses etc.
We have some of the finest pas
ture lands in the world. There is
in spots all over the parish vacant
places without a shadow of a fence
which fnrnish abundant pasturage
to the stock of every neighborhood.
Our swamps are grown up with
switch cane anil as a Winter range
afford great facilities for the rais
ing of cattle. We have all the va
rieties of mast for the hogs, includ
ing beech nut and all the acorns.—
Numbers of hogs are raised in the
Creek and Bayou swamps who are
not ted at all an'd do not know the
taste of corn.
For grazing hogs, sheep, horses
and goats we have the bermuda
and wire grass or crop grass and
as a grass for pasturage the bermu
da is fully equal to the celebrated
blue grass of Kentucky. The pas
turage of Texas cattle and ponies
has now grown to be a very impor
tant and respectable branch of in
dustry in the neighborhood of Al
exaudri.i, and is the source of much
profit to those who devote lauds to
that purpose. One gentleman here
is extensively engaged in cutting,
curing and baling hay and his hay
compares most favorably with that
brought from the West. There is an
unlimited field in that direction and
we hope to seo it more generally
pursued.

its soil.
As we intimated in our last arti
cle the soil of Rapides is diversified
in the extreme. On the river you
have clay, clay and sand mixed or
all sand. The general characteris
tic of the soil on the river is clay
and sand mixed. This is a rich
soil and yields abundantly. Upon
the bayous, the principal ones of
which are Rapides, Boeuf, Robert
and Cotile the soil is a rich alluvial,
easily cultivated, yielding abun
dantly of the strongest and most
exhausting of crops and seeming to
be almost inexhaustible in its fer
tility. The average yield from an
acre of this land well cultivated or
even with only moderately fair cul
tivation, is a bale of cotton or a hhd
of sugar. A bale atid hhd was the
standing crop befoie the war.
In the pine woods the soil is pret
ty much the same as pinewoods
soil the world over. Uncultivated
it grows a kind of sedge grass upon
which the cattle all get seal fat in
the Spring. The creek bottoms in
the piuewoods give a fine, rich soil
which produces abundantly of cot
ton ant! corn, makes the best pota
toes in the world and grows cane,
for a while at least, finely. It has
not the depth of the bayou or river
lands and of a consequence cannot
stand the heavy drafts upon it that

ITS TIMBER.
In timber Rapides is richly en
dowed. Her pine forests would
ran all the saw mills in the United
States for a considerable time.—
Turpentine orchards can just as
readily be made a source of wealth
here as well as in Washington par
ish on the Pearl River, in Alabama
near Mobile, or even on the Tar
river, in North Carolina. Bed Riv
er is convenient as a means of ship
ping and we wonder that nobody
has ever thonght of making "tar,
pitch and turpentine" in the pine
woods ot Rapides.
Upon the low lands we have the
oak, ash, hackberry, cotton wood,
a few scattering maples, poplar and
magnolias etc. In some of the
swamps there are cypress brakes
which if sawed into lumber would
make its owner richer than Roth
child.

The Lieutenant is a perfect gentle

high sense of honor of the regular
Army officer. We are pleased to
say that he was well treated while
here and that when he left on the
Sabine, to join his Company in New
Orleans it was with sincere regret
that many ot our citizens saw him

evidence of the great change which

that officers who commit outrages

[From the N. O. Bulletin, 21st.]
The Chamber of Commerce will
meet this eveuing for the purpose
ot-receiving and couferriug with
the gentlemen who compose the
committee from the Dallas Board
ot Trade, who are now in onr city
for the purpose of takiog such
steps as may be necessary to in
sure rail road connection with Tex
as.
We need scarcely say to onr citi
zens that this is a matter which is
not only worthy of their attention,
but which demands prompt and
vigorous action on their part. Wo
have been talkiug about a railroad
to Texas tor so long a time that we
hope the present enterprise will bo
distinguished from all other efforts
of a similar character by its works.
It takes money to build a rail
road, aud 110 man, not even Tom
Scott, ever constructed so much as
a foot of track with his tongue.
Let onr citizen* ponder #vell up
on the interest involved iu this
matter and then, instead ot meet
ing to pass long winded preambles
and high sounding but meaning
less resolutions, meet to nnbncril>c
whatever sum they can afford for
the construction of the road.
Our friends in Texas mean bwri

tion by rail with tile great metrop
olis of the South, aud they have
sent gentlemen here to talk bmines k
to our merchants not to join them
in flights ot oratory or in writing
well turned periods to tickle tliu
ears of tin' publie. The question is
one involving dollars and cents,
and, if it shall appear, as it unques
tionably will, that a rail road will
pay , then, as progressive business
men, atd as men anxious to bnild
up our own interests and fortunes
as well as those of our neighbor,
we should be willing to put out the
requisite amount to prosecute tlio
enterprise.
It is certain that the Texans will
do their share, let not our people
be found wanting. We trust there
will be a full meetiug at the Cham
ber this evening and that the prop
er spirit will be evinced iu this
most important matter.
