Louisiana Republicanin m.
Col. David Pierson in his sppeeh
on Saturday night said some true
things with regard to this mercenary
body that had t:ickedl themselves upon
the body of the Republican party. No
t tne namen i conld te given them than
that by which he most eloquently T
tdesignated the horde-"mercenaries.
'rThe New York Trthnne, a leading
.a13yes paper, says of them:
"The objects which these fellows
in Louisiana have in viewr are widely
separated from what we conceive to I
be the purposes of the honest body of
Republicans in the nation. They
thenmselves are, indeed, if we may
judge front their previous record, in
direct and positire antnagonism t tohe
party which they prelend to represent OL
They mean all manner of mischief
and combing only for gain and plan
ter,"
Now this is what the 'Tfibune Says Or
of these "fellows," mark the name, zen
· and no one will say that that language crit
is not strong. It is not as strong, her
however, as this: "No one that mn
knows anything of the political his. F
P tory of Louisiana since its reconstrue- wili
tion can have any doubt as to what the
course should be taken with the whole IIU
tribe of conspirators who call them
wlves the Republican party of that wat
State. They wold not he toleraccd real

So we see that names for these fIel. 1
lows are freely bandied by even the ant
New York Tribine. What more do --1
we want to convinc us of the truth of 1
these bold accusations, than a simple coti
look at home f Who are the mena
that constitute the parishl ticket of
the party of "unmitigated scamps in

Independents.
Tihe Independenlt movement can he
y well judged by the ITdian Indepen- I
. dent candidate for Governor, who
B sold himself out for money, to the Ile
,_ publicans.
lie Independents in politics are men
of no convictions, and a man of no
le conviction is "open for a trade ;" is
tl in the market, and the highest bid
rO der pays for and takes him. We care
not who the man is, these remarks
apply to him and none can escape
xi that judgment.
y. In Louisiana an Independent is
le, simply a traitor, to which is added
al the degrading vice of coartrdie
cowardlice of the rankest kind. It is
ue, lhe who betrays with a smile and a
Ji. kiss; who is a Hadical and a thief at
heart, and with his lips cries "Inde
rs pendence and honesty."
es We have several of that class of
bipeds in our State-some in our par
'as ish, but they are too contemptible
here to ripple the suntmface of a deent
organization. They practice the dodge
rdI of getting up letters from admirers to
n- become candidates for positions, or
si. else announce themselves as candi
dates oklens rvoens, and to show that
they are enemies to the people, the
rO Radical :Conventions either endorse
or nominate them. No donbt thsc
0o- Independents (?) think all this sharp,
but, to an honest people it is utterly
ti- disgusting.
Pretending to be sick of party and
party fi ands and trickery, of which
Ith they daily and hourly prate, their
1l- first advent before the people is char
no acterized by a trick so palpable and
o.- disgusting that every politician per se
would revolt at it for fear of being
dubbed a fool.
Ing Independents are wolves in sheep's
bill clothing, and having shammed the
nd people to get in, will sham them af
terwards.
If the radicals can find consolation t5
in theit victories in Ohio and---; s.
well that is all, they are welcome to in
the small comfort. The mannjority
against them in West Virginia is over "1l
12,000 and they dl1im it. They are al
behlind 6000 in Indfana and it is a tl
radical victory I Colorado goes Dem- ne
ocratic to the tune of 500 and still is
I radicals carry the State-so they say. ci
A few more such "scoops" as In- O
Idiana, West Virginia Colorado and ai
I even Ohio, and the rvictories to the 1
Sradicals will undo them. b
If any one ever doubted that the
"slop organ" on Front street was not
a liar, the last issue should convince b
them. C
The radical meeting increased from i
snumbers on the ground to fiOgures inc
that paper in the aggregate from 2000
to25(). No one knows better than
i' that radical writer that not Brea 500
a were present, and that paper says
- that the crowd was variously estim
I ated at from 2501) to 3000. This
- taken with the radical victories in
k Indiana and West Virginia as given
- by that paper, although those 8tates
wont the othler way at the polls, will
ºf set the organ up as big a liar as its
i- nanoeake in New Orleans and a big
. ger one for its age. Give as some
n more radical victories like those in
h Indiana and West Virginia please.
Tlt Demonstration on Tuesday
was enough to satisfy the most san
. guolne and fastidious of the radical
bummers of Natclhitoches that the
Diemocrats were "up and doing" And
id from the looks of their faces defeat
would lie but a small portion ok the
ills the future had for them.
n. For eight years rain and rascality
,have joined hands through the rad
' ical party of our parish lin prostrating,
not only a noble and good people,
ty but in stifling every honest and moral

Consistency i said to be a jewel, lir,
if so, the Budll(in lachks tha:tt glorious tlr

In its issue of one day last week
there appeared an article written 'I
against WVard, whlich,judging it light- and
ly, was a simple invitation to the in r
people of the Red Hiver Valley to who
kill Ward. Marked copies of the sinu
paper contaitning that article were
sent up to this sectioln, either by the not
writer of the article, or some friend, par
who longed for blood, and the blood has
of Ward particularly. wi
We are a snmall journal, with a cir- thr
(culation not as large as the ,llctlin, sana
and published but once a week, but the
with trembling fear we once called hlo
the "smart Alex" of that journal to ter
account for solnC expressions he had (
Susedc in relation to the blood-thirsty isti
-proclivities of the "Ilted iver valley res
Sbullhuoozers.t' Jii
We miiildly ns1ested that t1 Edi
tor of the J Iletin was not sfflicient=
l y acquainted with the people of the
Sled IRiver country to pnss judgment
is upon them in such a manner, and tirn
1timidly intinmated that we had gentle- Re
0 men as well as good, loyal, Confede
R rate soldiers, from "Avoyelles to Cad- l"'
' do," who would insure peace in this atl
section, and keep it at all hasards.
i The BIlletis bristled up amazingly t
d at our impudence in presuming to ai
- criticise its expressions, and arrogated ti
is to itself a knowledge of Louisiana
wI
a and its people, that would have made of
it a stranger gaze and gape with won- of
fvol
' der. e
Therefore we approach this quces
f tion of the "lalletin and Ward" with ar
arT
considerable anxiety for our safety-- e
he in a journalistic sense. tai
it The article to ,which we refer is col
te ill-timed, in the first place, and in the 8l1
Ssecond place, it is an invitation, aso
r we before stated, for some one to kill ,p
SWard, and thereby furnish the But- 4
Jt eli an opportunity to hold up its pe
1C innocent hands with holy horror at g
a our blood-thirsty scoundrelism, and sh
denounce us, as it has done, as law.
P breakers and villains.
SThe Balleti, it seems to us, do
sires only such killing as it wonld lei
esuggest. Twitchel, to whom a thou- wi

Swould be Salgts, was not to be touch- px

f. not to benefit Ward or his race, but e
to help Packard, Kellogg and the il

ty month ago, would have swooncd t(
rer "like a gentle lady in a dainty varlor P

a that Ward shall be killed. lWard didl
'- not rob as-Ward did not rush trobps *

Iy. eitizeas, insulting white women and "
It,- outraging liberty. Who did it f Pack- a

Ward did not, with Iis armeu bandR
at Colfa-r-enlisted, organised, and
equipped at Kellogg's suggestion, in
vade the home of the Ianocent at the
dead of night, and rape a beautiful,
accomplished, and delicate lady. C
Who did t
Packard's Chief Deputies, Stockton a
and Decline-DeCliuine, whom God In Di
e his wrath struck down with the most V
loathsome disease the human family I
is afflicted with; Stockton, whom a
Packard hugs to his bosom to this
f hour, as his friend.
1- Does the BslUetis say any tMig about
it ;
e Not one word; it is too busy get
d ting Ward killed to attend to such
it matters.
le We desire to say to the BUlleti,
that there are Badical negroes living
y in this parish to-day, and we name n
I- two of them-Blunt and Lewis-that
g, a thousand Ward's, with the sins of
e, the one a million times intoensifed,
al would be Saints in comparison too. i
n. Does the Bulleta want these men
to killed! Oh! no. Ward~he efect, and
it nout Blunt and Lewis the cause, is
e- the Baletes logic.
at We have stood by and seen this 1
Bsiletis insult the people of this val
ley until patience has ceased to be a
k- virtue; but this "last straw"n is
" enough.
'F We are not defenders of Ward, but
a) insist the asims w i w hist he s 5har

Those little symbols tell Almazingtly
and the few we indulged in last week ist
in regard to registr:ation changed the C
whlole Iaspect of the radical slate, ID
Ssmanshed it to atoms, as it were.
D We claimed that the lnegro vote did ,
e not exceed the white vote 7(0) in this ii
, parish and we claimi it still. There 'I
i has been a constant immigration of
whites since 1874, that year we
threw off radiecalism like a rope of
, sand ; with the hope on Ithe part of tc
t these itmmigrants that the whites anld i
i honest Imen 1had at last become man
o ters of the richl Natchitoches parish. in
i On Saturday last, RIuss, the re'g- i
Sistrar, went over the books and the tl
v result no little dismayed the radicals.
Hisi count now showns hi

The figures for the blacks are len
tirely out of proportion, for even wien
Red Hiver parish was attached to (s
we, had no suck black rtole, and there t'
has been no immigration of blacks to -
ithis parish since 1870.
We claim that the negro vote in
1870 is less than in 1874, for in ward
nine, which we cite as an instance,
Sthe registered colored vote in 1874
was 178; now, after a careful canvass
Sof the ward, there are ibut 120 colored
voters to be tond in it; 58 having
left the parish.
SSeven hundred registered majority
are tall figures and any one can get
bets taken on their not going beyond
that. Haby concedes live hundred
is colored Democratic votes in the par
e ish ; we claim one thousand. Any
'one who desires can "figure it up" by
ll splitting the difference and see who
will win. There will be registered and
ts polled nincteca hundred white Demo
lt eratic votes in this parish beyond thie
id shadow of a doubt.
