SCORCHING WEATHER.
Ee"t Ia the Middle West Breaking Be
eerde at Nigh Teaspernstre.
Washington, July 2.--One hundred
degrees temperatures were common
throughout the great corn belt Mon.
day according to reports to the weather
bureau here. In various places all pre
vious heat records were smashed. There
appears to be no prospect of relief from
these exhausting conditions for the next
two days at least, except such as may
some from the always present possibili
ty of scattered thunderstorms which are
predicted for some portions of the ou
pjrheated area.
Absolutely no rain fell in the corn
belt. In western Iowa it was a trifle
cooler while in the central portions of
the state it was warmer. There was a
little belt of high pressure over the
great lakes and another over the mouth
Atlantic coast, but it offers no prospect
of relief in the west.
The warm weather was again general
throughout the entire country except on
the Pacific coast. Thunder showers
have continued from the south Atlantic
coast westward into Arisona and a con
tinuation of them is predicted for the
south and southwest.

Washington, July 34.-The weather
bureau officials find nothing in the con.
ditions to justify any prediction of a
change of temperature in the heated
section uf the country. The principal
weather bureau stations in the middle
Mississippi valley show a slightly lower
temperature, but forecasters say there
is absolutely no permaeas change in
