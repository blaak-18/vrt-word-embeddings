"I hope the time will come when

"But what are they going to do if
they need the money?" put in his sis

"Oh. half of them don't. They have
parents who could just as well sup

frills."
'If they want the good things of life
and ho ve brains enough to secure them,

It is the Worst possible policy to c(A;
a child naughty.
"You are such a naughty child!"
"I think you are the naughtiest little
boy I ever saw!"
These are expressions which not odny
rouse a passion of resentment in a
child's breast, but harden him as welt.
The child's point of vie'.w is the right
one too. He may hive ebrokeIn a vsý
or he may have been ddishedient, but
does this one fault make him wicked
and depraved': If so. 1{" might as witl

or pride should be appealed to. Punish
the child, but make your punishment a
logical one. Never punish,without ex
plaining.
Children, even the tiniest ones, are
more capable of reasoning than we give
them credit for being. If your child Is
bad tempered, selfish or a story teller,
in nine cases out of ten it Is your own
-fault. If you had taken these faults In
their very beginnings, when the child
was perhaps a mere baby, you would
not have to keep correcting him now
and devising new forms of punishment.
The trouble with the average mother is
that she waits until the child is "old
enough to understand." When the
child 9k old enough to show signs of a
fault, then he is old enough to be re
strained from committing that fault
and to be helped to that end In the kind
est and most patient of ways.
''dry few children need herole han
dling, 'but all need watchful and con
stant care, together with advice suited
to their small understandings. Never,
if possible; break 'a child's spirit or
pride. Do' not'scold or reprove him In
the presen a of company. Speak to him
quietly afterward.
Above. all, be just in your treatment
of the little ones. Let your "No" be a
"No" and your "Yes" a "Yes," and do
not let circumstances or the presence of
Other people make you relax your laws.

with a proper amount of firmness, no

~ashion Notes.
The Monte Carlo coats continue to
be, well liked, and they are dressy.
But for the rough stuffs the two piece
blouse suit is the best style. Hats
seem to have grown flatter than ever,
but -somehow they all manage to re
main quite as becoming as ever.
Toques of dress material are undenia
bix stylish and not so very econom
ieal as one might think, for though
the body of the hat Is made of the
pleces of stuff left over it requires a
master hand to make a toque look -well,
and some fine trimminng must be found
to go on, though probably it will look
ao thouxh it did not cost much. Still
the toque has a reason to be, and that
Is ftlt a Whole suit of anytling is the
vogue. One todue was made of nub
cloth as to crown and brim, though this
last was almost hidden under a thick
wreath of velvet autumn leaves. The
effect was 'rich and seasonable.

Miss Wantrell, the city w-e
man. "They don't talk anything but
personalities, and they make fun of one
another constantly behind backs. It
makes me think of Flipton, where I
used to teach school. There were X co
men in that town whin knew every
movement of their acquainta n-e. ame
twisted the most innofent icts into
somethin; to be criticised or ridiculed.
They watched the postotiice to see how
often people got letters. They peeked
out behind their closed blinds to study
their neighbors' clotheslines. If patch
ed garments were displayed. these
gossips did everything but publish the
fact in the village newspaper. If a
man, married or single, c.lled at a
house of an evening, the town knew of
it next day, andi motives were imputed
to the man which he in his wildest
moments could hardly have dreamed
of."
"ittt ire country people worse gos

"Indeed they are. In tie city there
is always somewhere to go and some
excitemient to occupy the thouglht. The
city woman ,Aho untdertook) to lee:P

Flatly, I do not believe it.
Of old humility was considered the
virtue of women and slaves.
No new woman is ever found in an
old woman's home.
If men, law and custom do not stop
discriminating against and persecuting
the feminine sex for being wives and
mothers, the feminine sex will in time
cease to be either. Men may as well
know now that this is the ultimate of
that finncial independence for wom
en *hlch is coming as fast as time
can bring it. Normal woman naturally
likes man, but now that she is able to
earn her own living it will have to be
a tolerably fine man who can woo and
win her. She more and more looks at
the man himself, not at the "support."
Let the man- take notice accordingly.
Isn't It about time some women
learned to mind their own business?
Do not glory In weakness and cow

That n{hte organization, the National
Council of Jewish Women, has now
more than ;,000 members. Its presi

Pathetic Is the story that a grand
daughter of Patrick Henry, Mrs. Vir
ginia Hienfy Beasley. aged, penniless
and friendless, is now waiting to die
in a charity home at Ithaca, N. Y. She
is eighty-seven years old, but apparent
ly as able to earn her own living as
she was at twenty, for she says: "My
father was a son of Patrick Henry.
He owne4 a great plantation on which
there were 4000 slaves. The war
wrecked my father's fortune." Mrs.
Beasley was brought up' in the old
helpless, useless way to do nothing.
That was her greatest misfortune.
The-southern woman of the new school

Two ablebodied widows, mother and
daughter, advertise in a Long Island
paper for husbands, one apiece, to take
care of them. Those two ablebodied
widows will find themselves much bet
ter -off if they hustle and take care of
themselves. Men in these days are
not marrying women to take care of
them.
The writer of a letter printed in the
Philadelphia North American says she
is a widow. eighty-seven years old.
that she reads without glasses and
does her own housework. That is the
right sort of widow. Let us have more
of them.
Women's clubs, especialy woman

his wife regularly a fixed sum for her

pleases? If so, what pet cent of Ija In

2. What do- you considEs the duties *1 a

3. Are you willing Ib allow *ou9 wife
the same liberty of personal action that
you claim for yourself-for instance. in

abe lack of it. In the girl cPild it is the
beginning of a false education; in the
grown wonman it is the distressing re
suit of that education. Women have
been trained to regard the tout ensene
ble of mere physical appearance as
bhe all in all of the female being; con
sequently they are always in a stew
in regard to that appearance.
This eternal self consciousness crip
ples a woman when she would speak in
public. It peeps out evermore in the
oratory of clubwomen. It is the direst
enemy to their success in that field.
Get rid of it, then. But bow? Well,
resolve once for all that you will get
rid of It or die. Make yourself cease
to think about the Impression you are
making on others. If you find you are
doing this: in spite of good resolution.
check yourself instantly. Think of
sowething else. Do this in all the af
fairs of life. In proportion as you do
It, in proportion as you can merge your
petty personality into the infinite life,
to that exact degree you will really be

Would you like to make a speech?
Sit down first, quietly and alone, and
think very earnestly with all your pow
ers of concentration on what you want
to say. Don't for one second let the
chilling, killing, accursed thought of
whether your audience will consider
you, Jane Smith, brilliant aiti wise, re
main in your mind. Just think of what
you, Jane Smith, desire to say in all
good will and modesty. Make a per
fect picture in your mind of yourself
standing before the audience speaking
this matter.
Then prepe re your speech, Never
read it if you can possibly avoid it, but
speak It. Stand up like a man and look
people In the eye and let yourself go.
Hutt your sentences winged with the
magnetic force of your soul. Women's
clubs will fall to pieces if women do not
stop reading those long, stupid papers.
If you have only a rive or ten minute
address to make, do not write it at all.
Put upon paper the heads of what you
would say, then talk the speech over to
yourself in your mind till you are fa
miliar with it as with A B C. That is
the best way of all to make a speech.
Then speak distinctly. in a clear
voice. How acquire this clear, distinct
voice? Bring your voice forward from
your throat and issue it from your
lips. opening your lip-s moderately wide
so it can get out. To understand ex
