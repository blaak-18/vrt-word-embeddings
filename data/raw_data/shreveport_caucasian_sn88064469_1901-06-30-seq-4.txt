Na Use Trying to Live.
Uuder this ca;t:o'_, in a review of
the enemies of ianukiid in the torui
ut germs and othel torrible things
wuica are developitng, says the New
Orlesns S!atea, in such va4t tumbers
and with ,uch startling rapidity that
a great many ;eopie are beg.nuing
to ice! Ibtt there is very little sense
in tryuig to live, !d. ashout the best
they can do is to fold their bauds
becomingly and go in search of a
heavenly harp. The wmoquit i. whose
s.ft rouudlays have often been heard
in the cttlly hours of the languorous
nights, has recently acquiredl the rep
rehensible thabit of injecting a cargo
or yellow lever bacilli into the Luman
system. 'lhe little bohse fy which
ceuturies ago dallied with the bald
pates and the crimhou beaks of our
lamented forefathers and was then re
garded as entirely harmlcsa, now
duds steady employment as the dis
tributtug agent of typhoid germs
and sore eyes.
"This i. bsd enough, bu' there is
worse to cme'. A di-tinguIshed
aember of the Masss~usetta Medi
cal Society declares that paper money
which has been in circu'ati3u any
length of time fairly reeks with dee
perate and deally germs; that the cur,
rency issud by Uncle Sam is the great
oat menium for the spread of fatal in
fectious diseases that ha e beext dis
covered by medical scieuce up to the
present time, yet we have observed
that every doctor will receive lu
paym"' t for his professiaonal service:
old bank bills or treasury notes that
look as though they hau been
dragged through a lard barrel or a
charnel house and pocket them with
eat the slightest hesitation, his
thoughts at the time no dou.t being
far away from carnivorous bugs of
all descriptions. The statement of the
Aembtr of the M .ssachtsetts medieal
Society troubles our conscience
sarely, for we are aware that we have
ItaocentlY unloaded on worthy medi
eol not fewer than two hundred
thOusand billions of the worst kind
ot germs, but so far as we know the
doetors are still alive and still col
leetlng more billions of begs from
eotdiU.g friends. For fear, however,
that we may be the means of placing
some doctor in direct connection
with a vicious microbe and causing
hia untimely death we deem it a duty
to pay no more of their bills in the
future."
A Good Resolution,
The anuou~ctmeut that Miss Vi
visa Sarloris will not marry thb
Tuglishmao, Blttour, shows that the
yroung lady is capable ot a good res
olution.
Per mother tried a 'oreign alliance
to the sorrow of her frieutd. Miss
Sartoris would do well to return to
the United States and eultiyate the
acquaintance ot some hardy youug
American who could give her his
love sad fidelity and who would not
bang around awaiting remittances
from her rich relatives.
The foreign husband has become a
trayed out matrimonial subject-At
lata GConstitutiou.
Tbq love and ndelity of a good
Amerlcan citisen, a "hardy young
American,' is at greater value, of
iMebtlmable worth to a yonag woman
who is not itdinsed to buy a tite
with a frayed oqt husband thrown in.
If the ambitioUs womat could get-the
titli 1tbout the foreign subject,
4*ere would be, some consolation n
'theit*ietioa that in her t der
sire to gratify ambition abe has
beel relidved of a burC'n, a frayed
out, no count husband. Bit t'imab

T! e Republicans with all their pre

It is possible that a congress with

menasure providing the reduction of

Stat.s which have restricted suffrage,
and if suce a bill were passed, it

of President McKinley, but whether
the proposed iuterferaice with the
suttrage law of any of the States or
the South be "oluff" for political
efiect or not, the States of the South
will be drawn Into a closer compact
than ever.
There are some good men in the

proteetioe and self-preservation will
resist every encroachment of the tLe

and their blauaisbments-their re

allured by fair promises and tat

to greater and more determiuea
action in their resistance of Mc
Kinlevism and Hannaism.
SKleptomania
There Is a manifest disposition to
translate kleptomania ,into plain
stealiog.-Commercial appeal.
Plain stealiug applies to niggers
asd the white trash. A man or
woman who will appropria'e a loai
of bread to appease hanger is a thief
it is plain stealing, but the "gentle
man" who. with well laid sobemes
hab relieved some confiling friend of
oli money or has abstracted lands
from a bank is a kleptomaniac. Com
mon, poor people steal; the high
toned, the "slick" do not. Klepto
maniac can never be translated to
apply to the thief who Is a "gentle
man." The slicker the thief and the
bigger his wad, the greater is his
safety irom the pen. There Is little
hope and little sympathy for the man
or woman who has stolen bread to
eat when hungry.

In many American cities women
have opened bootblacking rooms for
their own sex and for chhldren and are
making a good living. A young lady
of excellent family. Miss Parkhurst,
has established such a place in the
most crowded 1tart of New York's busi
ness section.
It Is not worth while for commence
ment orators to recommend marriage
as a life vocation for young ladles.
They will go In for It fast enough,
never fear.
". Rt It
In one court in one day recently in
New York city there were 119 applica
tions for divorce. Worst of all. . larg
majority of the cases were undefended,
showing that one partner in the Arm
was as anxious to be free as the other.
Best of all means to bring to time the
man who deserts his family is that law
proposed by the Illinois board of asso
ciated charities. It recommends that
such a husband and father be sen
tenced to hard labor at some trade in
the state prison. Wages shall be al
lowed for his work meantime, the
wages to be turned over In every In
stance for the support of his wife and
children. Excellently well done, 1111-i
nols board of charities! A woman has
a perfect right to earn her own li, ing,
but she cannot do it with little children
to take care of.

Among other things to which the c
twentieth century will point with pride'(
will be the improved physical status of
civilized women. The consumptive,
protected female betolne is already
rapidly giving place to the heroine who
can protect herself. Woman's physical
weakness is a gigantic blunder to be <
blamied not 3n the Creator, but on wo- |
mqn herself and on msan, who has en
couraged her In It. While man has s
moved heaven and earth to develop
and improve 'himself physically woman
has simply let herself Sliump alohg, flab- f
by of duscle and growing flabbier.

The chief item of our great m
production in quantity, value and
nomnc importance, was coal, the
duction of which in 1900 was 26S,

tons, or six per cent over 1899.
Pig iron was second in order of rvalt
