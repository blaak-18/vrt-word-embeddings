BY PRESIBENT OF
MILITARY SCHOOL
Moral Weakening and Ef
feminacy Charge Against
Modern Youths
PARENTS ARE BLAMED
Boys Must Re Given Real Re*
sponsibilities if They Are
to Develop
(Special Correspondence)
MILWAUKEE, WIS., March 10.—
Effeminacy, moral weakening; their
.opposite extreme, vicious lawless
ness —these are not mere words, says
Col. Ferrand of St. John’s Military
academy, Delafield, Wis., but very
real and present dangers.
Speaking recently before the Grand
avenue Men’s Congregational club of
Milwaukee, Col. Farrand in no uncer
tain terms called attention to an in
creasing tendency toward immorality
and aimlessness on the part of a
large portion of the younger genera
tion.
Nor were his warnings mere gener
alities, for, one after the other, he
xited instances and statistics, gather
ed from throughout the country,
that made his hearers gasp. Grade
-schools in a city of 100,000 with 95
eases of social disease in one year.
Fifteen girls compelled to leave a
high school in one term because of
approaching motherhood. Banditry.
Trie increasing number of so-called
lounge lizards with their sleek-hair
ed, girlish prettiness. All of these,
not isolated cases, but more or less
typical throughout the country.
Blame* Parents
Col. Farrand laid the blame square
ly and bluntly at the doors of par
ents and educators. Of the younger
generation he said:
“I sympathize rather than blame,
I condone rather than condemn.” But
of parents and teachers, “I think
that never since time began have
parents been so incompetent, or
teachers so indifferent. There is
where the blame lies, and if our
country goes down to ruin and decay,
it will be because the parents of to
day have miserably failed.”
Col. Farrand seriously suggests that
one of the needs of the age is a
school for parents—to teach the ac
tual job of fatherhood and mother
hood. , ,
As a solution of the present boy
ond girl problem, Col. Ferrand offer
ed many suggestions, the first of
which was the abolition of co-edu
cation at least in secondary or high
schools. _
Girls Develop Faster
‘‘Not only is propinquity a power
ful influence toward the present
-widespread immorality, but boys of
less virile type become persistently
more feminized. Those more virile
are driven out of school by teachers
who fail to understand them and
cover up their own failure by stamp
ing a boy as unruly, vicious or back
ward.” “In addition,” said Col. Fer
rand, “boys in the early teens are
not on a mental parity with girls ol
the same age. It is not fair to the
"boy to force him to compete with his
mental superior, and then drive him
from school by undeserved criticism
when he fails to measure up.”
Another point the colonel brought
out was the necessity of communities
giving greater, intelligent attention
to their schools. “They must be will
ing to pay enough to make teaching
attractive to able men and women,”
he said.
“But most important of all, the
boy must be trained —mentally and
morally. He must be given responsi
bilities for which he will be held res
ponsible. They must be adapted to
nis age and ability, but they must be
responsibilities, nevertheless.”

Klan Is Active in
Kansas Town of 100
RICHLAND, KAN., March 11
Calling at the local Methodist church
last Sunday while the farewell serv
ice for the Rev. Mr. Bell was in prog
ress, 12 robed Klansmen presented
the pastor with a sum of money. He
was complimented for his good work
in a note accompanying the gift. Af
ter kneeling at the altar while the
pastor offered a prayer, the knights
departed.
Klansmen recently visited a rural
school entertainment and presented
the teacher > with a cash gift to be
used in purchasing a Bible. The
teacher plans to read the Bible
daily. Although located in a town
of not more than 100 population, the
local unit has achieved the reputation
of being one of the most active or
ganizations in eastern Kansas.

ST- PAUL’S 75TH
ANNIVERSARY IS
HELBONMARCH4
Said to Be Fastest Growing
Municipality in United
States
HAS MANY INDUSTRIES
Fort Snelling;, Founded in 1820,
Termed One of Rest in
Country
ST. PAUL, March 4.--St. Paul today
celebrated its seventy-fifth anniver
sary as the capital city of Minnesota.
It Is a far cry from the present
time to the time of the first real es
tate transfer to Jonathan Carver in
1767 when Hawnopawjatin and Otoh
tongoomlisheaw, chiefs of the In
dians of the Sioux nation surrendered
the tract of land “from the Falls of
St. Anthony running on the east bank
of the Mississippi, nearly southeast,
as far as Lake Pepin, where the Chip
pewa joins the Mississippi and from
thence five days travel, accounting
twenty English miles per day and
from thence again to the Falls of St.
Anthony on a direct straight line.”
City property values today furnish
tangible proof of the city’s develop
ment.
St. Paul ended 1923 as the second
fastest growing city per capita in
the United States, according, to fig
ures compiled by Mayor Nelson.
It was the thirteenth city in the
United States in actual volume of
building permits last year and yet is
but the thirty-fifth city in point of
size. In South St. Paul a great pack
ing industry is growing rapidly; with
in a radius of 250 miles from St.
Paul is contained the greatest dairy
section in the world, the automobile
industry is well developed, and, last
but not least, St. Paul is the scene
yearly of the greatest state fair in
the world.
In 1820 the corner stone for Fort
Snelling was laid. On the last visit
of General Pershing it was termed
“one of the best in the United States.”
In 1838 Pierre Parrant, first settler,
built a log cabin near Fountain Cave.
This year there will be $6,000,000
spent in school construction alone.
In 1840 Joseph Rono purchased Ed
ward Phelan’s claim for S2OO. This
year St. Paul will spend $5,000,000
for trunk line sewers and $8,000,000
will be spent for streets, roads, and
bridges in the city and county.
The first balloon ascension was
made in 1857 by W. Markoe, S. S.
Eaton and H. H. Barnes, and today
St. Paul boasts of the first National
Guard aero squadron in the world.
On April 13, 1861, the first call for
troops in the Civil war was received,
and four days later the first company
of the First Minnesota Volunteers
was organized. This year the na
tional convention of the American
Legion will be held here.
“St. Paul has grown and is still
growing.”
AGRICULTURAL NEEDS
OUTLINED IN ST. PAUL
Farmers are “Rig Rusiness” of
Nation, Says Frederick
Renz
Farmers are really the “big busi
ness” of this country, and “when they
realize that fact agriculture will
gain its proper place in our econom
ic life,” Frederick Benz, agricultural
agent of the Northern Pacific rail
way, declared Tuesday in an address
before the St. Paul Transportation
club at its weekly luncheon meeting
at the St. Paul hotel. Mr. Benz was
for many years a successful Wash
ington farmer.
“Note that our agricultural indus
try,” said, Mr. Benz, “with a valua
tion of $77,924,100,336, is worth more
than all our coal mines, banks, rail
roads and factories, which have a
combined value of $72,358,479,027.
America is primarily an agricultural
nation. The American agricultural
college should be our foremost in
stitution of learning.
“The needs of agriculture today,
as I see them, are simply education,
legislation, representation, organiza
tion and elimination. Unless we rec
ognize and grant these just needs, we
face a national crisis more threaten
ing than we have ever faced before.
The greatest need of America to
day is a thoroughly educated and
well trained agricultural population
fitted for scientific production and
scientific marketing, and if this were
provided, many present farm prob
lems would disappear.
“Organized farms would help the
situation. Investments, depreciation,
costs of operation and management
should be known and a record kept.
“The untaxed wealth of our coun
try should be taxed to relieve the
tax burdens now borne by the farms.
A lot of pernicious laws which lead
to universal hardship and extrava
gance should be repealed. Our gov
ernment should be simplified to make
it more efficient and reduce its cost.
Farmers should be represented in our
law-making bodies by statesmen, not
by politicians.”
TUNNELTON, W. VA., March 11—
A national lecturer for the Ku Klux
Klan delivered an address to members
only at the local klavern a recent
evening. The lecturer, who, in ad
dition to making a talk investigated
the condition of the local organiza
tion and reported that it in "in line
shape.” The speaker was accorded a
hearty ovation by local Klansmen.
THE FIERY CROSS
MINNESOTA POTATO
GROWERS ORGANIZE
Stops Taken to Incorporate 31
Gopher State Associa
tions
MINNESOTA, March 3.—lnitial
steps were taken today for incorpor
ating 31 associations in connection
with the organization of the new
Minnesota Potato Growers’ exchange.
A meeting for this purpose was
held in offices of the general state
organization committee, 319 Com
merce building. Attending were
Aaron Sapiro, California attorney
and nationally known co-operative
marketing specialist; S. G. Rubinow,
Minnsota campaign manager; J. F.
Reed, president, Minnesota Farm
Bureau federation; N. J. Holmberg,
state agricultural commissioner; F.
W. Peck, state agricultural college;
J. A. Monson, chairman of the state
committee; Walter Oby, treasurer:
Edward Barr, secretary; Marius Wal
dal, vice chairman and other agri
cultural leaders.
The meeting followed the close of
the successful campaign when more
than 12,000 Minnesota farmers sign
ed contracts, covering an acreage of
more than 155,000, to market their
potatoes co-operatively through the
new exchange.
Mr. Sapiro arrived yesterday from
Winnipeg to aid in the work of in
corporation of the various county as
sociations.
The 10-months* organization cam-
Eaign ended Saturday with quotas
eing passed for both members and
acreage.
The new exchange will be the larg
est co-operative marketing body in
the United States.
“The potato campaign in Minneso
ta,” said Mr. Sapiro, “is among the
most outstanding successes in the
history of co-operative marketing in
this country. In no other campaign
has the quota been so far oversign
ed within the time limit.”
There was such a rush of contracts
as the campaign closed that it will
be several days before the exact
membership is known.
CUT $1,031,600 FUND
AMONG SCHOOLS
(Continued From Page 1)
most steadily since 1864-65 when the
first semi-annual distribution was
made according to Christopher Lin
dahl, accountant in the department
of education.
For that year 64,330 pupils were
included for apportionment and the
rate was 63 cents in the fall and 13
cents in the spring, off a total of 76
cents for the year.
Since that time, Mr. Lindahl said,
up to the present date, more than
$67,500,000 have been distributed to
the schools of the state from the in
terest on the permanent school fund
and the one mill state school tax in
approximately equal amounts.
The money for this recent appor
tionment is available to the several
school districts just as soon as the
county treasurer makes his March
tax settlement to the state.
Following are some of the counties,
number of pupils and amounts paid:
Benton county, 2,852 pupils, $5,-
989.20.
Blue Earth county, 5,638 pupils,
$11,839.80.

Changes in state aid to assure dis
tribution so that rural schools and
high schools will derive greater bene
fit were under discussion late today
by the Minnesota School Board asso
ciation, as it wound up its two-day
session at the state capitol.
State aid was the main issue in a
discussion of proposed legislation for
schools, as the association went on
record for a committee to assure
closer co-operation with the Minne
sota Education association, and pre
pared to elect officers.
The question of financing educa
tion of pupils in districts away from
home was debated, some members ar
guing that the state should continue
its practise of paying $7 for the sup
port of pupils in other districts and
others arguing that the cost should
be borne by the district in which
they live.
Methods of distributing state aid
were discussed by J. M. McConnell,
state commissioner of education, who
explained that the purpose of aid
was to assure equal opportunity for
all children, to stimulate progress,
to provide teacher training depart
ments and to aid school districts with
high tax levies.
Speakers today included George E.
Susens of Alexandria, who discussed
taxation us a means of obtaining
funds for ud\ancement of education,
and A. P. Ritchie of Bemidji, who
discussed transportation of pupils.
KIEVESVILLE, W. VA., March 10.
Approximately 100 robed Klansmen

on the payment of a church bell re
cently purchased.

T)ERHAPS one of the most
highly perfected sins of our
modern civilization is “grafting.”
Wherever you turn, you see men
who have been led astray by Sa
tanic influences. The subtle
whispers of the Graft-Devil made
them think that “nobody would
find out.” So they took the long
chance, jeopardizing thereby hon
or, position, reputation and the
happiness of those who are near
and dear. The first step seemed
to prove the Graft-De\il’s lies.
Deeper and deeper the victims
of delusions wandered into the
dark caves of the Graft-Devil.
Truth will out. A day of reck
oning inevitably comes and, alas,
the fearfulness of the penalty.
The victims of the Graft-Devil
pathetically insist that they did
not intend to steal. Maybe not.
They stand, however, guilty of
the prostitution of a place of
public trust, for personal and
selfish ends. In a heap of wreck
age falls a life, once carefully
lived. A black stigma is placed,
not only upon the grafter, but
his family. Bitter waxes the
struggle of re-establishment as
the victims of the Graft-Devil at
tempt to live down the past. We
can hear them sigh as they say,
“It might have been ditferent.”
The Church of Scotland and the
United Free church have sent a com
mission of inquiry to South America
to determine the best means for pro
viding churches for the thousands of
Scottish people engaged in the wool
trade of Patagonia.

McADOO*S CANDIDACY
STUMPING QUESTION
out that was based on the Indrehus
vote. R. C. Bell, McAdoo manager,
proposed taking the vote for Mrs.
Oleson, which would give rural coun
ties more delegates, he said.
“Mr. Bell came over and whispered
to me that the Oleson vote would
give Minneapolis more delegates,"
Mrs. F. A. Kingsley announced.
Z. H. Austin of Minneapolis de
clared the Indrehus vote was the
fairest test of Democracy. In Min
neapolis and elsewhere, he said, Mrs.
Oleson fell down in Democratic pre
cinct and got her big vote in Repub
lican strongholds.
John E. Regan of Mankato said that
the “propoganda” that “a vote for
Indrehus was a vote for socialism"
cost Indrehus heavily in the southern
counties, and they would be penalized
by using his vote as a basis.
Chairman Wolf misunderstood the
remark and challenged the state
ment.
“He didn’t say that was so,” James
A. Carley called out. “You’ve got a
chip on your shoulder that you’ve got
to get off.’’
Clash With Regan .Next
Mr. Indrehus himself came to bat
then.
“Did you help save the Republican
party, too?" he asked of Regan.
“No," Regan shot back. “I’m too
good a Democrat for you to make
such a crack as that. But I don’t
think you helped the Democratic par
ty any when you filed."
Chairman Wolf displayed the “chip”
again as the meeting closed. He olb
served that during the campaign he
had billed Mrs. Oleson and Mr. In
drehus to speak together at Mankato,
and had been told they didn’t want
Indrehus, as he would hurt the tick
et.
“I’m the man he is talking about,”
Regan told the committee. “I told
him what everyone was saying, that it
was hurting both candidates when
they appeared together, and that Mrs.
Oleson was carrying the load. Any
one who heard them in the cam(>aign
knows that is true.”
Committee Tangled
When it came to a vote, the com
mittee was tangled up with a series
of motions and finally called the roll,
members answering “Oleson” or
“Indrehus.” Mrs. A.. K. Gault, the
secretary, gave the vote 14 for Ole
son and 12 for Indrehus.
“No,” two or three members de
clared, “it was a tie.”
She was about to call the roll over
when Z. H. Austin announced that he
and T. J. McDermott had agreed on
a compromise, using the Cox vote.
The roll call was stopped to put his
motion and carry it, while R. C. Bell
protested this would cut down the
rural counties.
Scottish Christians have united in
opposition to the smuggling of lio
uor into the United States by vessels
flying the British flag. The Scottish
Christian Union in a resolution, just
received in this country, declares
this to be “a scandalous traffic en
dangering the friendly relations of
two kindred Christian countries."

1200 People Hear Klan Address
At Muscatine
MUSCATINE, I A., March B.—Dr. G.
C. Minor of the national lecture bur
eau of the Knights of the Ku Klux
ITiain gave a public address at the
armory here one evening the past
week, when the principles of the or
der were explained to all who cared
to listen.
It is estimated that 1200 people
filled the armory and were well
pleased with the lecture.
Following the public gathering, Dr.
Minor talked to the members of the
local Klan in their Klavern.
After the lecturer’s visit, many
Americans in this city expressed
their desire to become members of
the Klan.
Although two reporters of local
newspapers attended the meeting,
not one line concerning it or any
thing that was said, appeared in the
press.
Rumor has it here, that the Klan
was successful in the recent election
in putting over the mayor by a ma
jority of more than 1600 votes.
