SAY OF OTHER EDITORS
The Blackshear Times says that
Tom Watson is a howling success. In
the Foreign Mission discussion he
had certainly made that Philadel
phia professor howl. —Coffee County
News, Douglas, Ga.
Vardeman, of Mississippi, in his
contest for the United States Sena
torial toga went down in defeat be
fore the combined attack of the
representatives of greedy corpora
tions and predatory trusts, but like
a true hero he doesn’t give up the
fight for the common people, but
gave notice that next year in the pri
mary for the long term he would
carry his case to the people them
selves, instead of having it decided
by friends of the trusts, elected to
represent the people, but who in
reality betray their constituents to
further the interests of the exploit
ers of the people. The intelligent
voter will watch with interest to see
if Senator-elect Percy, who is the at
torney for a number of large cor
porations, will align himself with the
Bailey-Standard Oil-Aldrich element,
and use his influence to “squelch”
every measure that is in the interest
of the masses of the people.—Blade
and Bludgeon, Fort Gaines, Ga.
Ask the reason for the political
unrest throughout the entire coun
try and but one answer will be given,
the undue influence exerted in
America’s affairs by a small com
pany of leaders representing a small
area of the United States. The re
volt in the Republican party is due
mainly to the unwillingness of the
rank and file to serve longer under
the Aldrich standard. Political bosses
instead of steering the course of
legislation in accordance with what
the people really want, lay it out in
accordance with what they believe
the people should want, and have
shown both contempt and indiffer
ence to the express promises of their

Some preachers have so run en
tirely out of Scriptural argument for
modern methods in Foreign Missions
that they are actually arguing that it
raises the price of cotton. Therefore,
and consequently, since it opens up
new fields of commerce, we ought to
spend our hard-earned money saving
the souls of the heathen so when
they are converted they will want to
buy more clothes to wear. Such a
beautiful Christian spirit in which to
convert the innocent creatures to our
religion. Some how it always sound
ed to us like there was a commercial
spirit back of all this pleading for
the poor, destitute heathen.—Tal
botton (Ga.) News.
Editor McGinty, of the Whigham
Journal, and Mr. T. M. Whigham,
president of the Grady County Local
Farmers’ Union, are having quite a
lively controversy as to the charge
of corruption against the State offi
cers of the Farmers’ Union which has
been made by Hon. Thomas E. Wat
son in The Jeffersonian. We are
obliged to side with Editor McGinty
in the view that if the Union offlcals
are guilty they should be removed,
and if they are not guilty they should
court an investigation of the charges
in order that they might be vindi
cated. The matter seems to have
gone too far now to be smothered.
A thorough investigation is the only
reasonable solution of the affair.—
Moultrie (Ga.) Journal.
A man’s life is about as valuable
as a Texas steer in the opinion of the
Cherry mine owners, who are set
tling damage claims of the widows of
the miners who perished in the Cher
ry disaster at the rate of SIOO a
head. —Turner County Banner, Ash
burn, Ga.
Hon. Wm. Murray, while in Nor
man Monday looking after his candi
dacy for Governor, remarked that
Hon. Thos. E. Watson’s articles on
“Socialists and Socialism” were the
best articles ever published by any
one on the subject, and that same
should be in every school in the
State. Hon. Thos. E. Watson is a
top-notcher on every subject he takes
up; in fact, we regard Mr. Watson
as the greatest living American. His
writings will live in the libraries of
the nation and the world. At the
present time he is doing the best
writing of his life and it appears in
Watson’s Magazine, which we are of
fering to new subscribers for one
year, together with the People’s
Voice, to January 1, 1911, for only
SI.OO. —The People’s Voice (Okla

Ugly looking women wear loud

Should the Wall street gang to
whom this Government has gracious
ly turned over the fiscal affairs of the
people, decide to bring on a panic,
they could knock the stuffing out of
this high priced land in a month.
What is the thing to do? Evidently
the thing to do is to get get up and
let your Congressman know that you
will hold him accountable for any
part he has in destroying or retiring
the greenbacks, melting down our
silver dollars, establishing a wildcat
asset currency to be issued by banks
or giving support to the central bank
idea —or any other measure which
puts into the hands of stock jobbers
power to manipulate the money sup
ply of the country. It is the duty of
the country. It is the duty of every
American to be on guard and to see
to it that he does the things that will
benefit the people rather than the
money lords. —Better Way, Minne
apolis, Kan.
One Jeflcrsoniurk
Thos. Watson makes a strong de
nial to Wm. T. Ellis in Sunday’s Con
stitution. Evidently the gentleman
did not know much of the debating
power of the brainy Georgian, else
he would have been very slow in
challenging him. A joint debate
with Watson is an honor not often
sought by men prominent in public
affairs, for he stands ready with all
the facts and figures, and his oppo
nent generally comes out a little
wilted. His reference to the gener
osity of Jesse Mercer is appreciated
by all Georgians.—Tri-County News,
Chipley, Ga.
Those recalcitrant Democrats who
voted with Joe Cannon at the last
session of Congress have at this term
stood as a man against Cannon and
Cannonism. Thus they seek to wipe
out the disgrace of desertion hereto
fore. Well, better late than never,
but voters, who will soon have the
opportunity of retiring these Con
gressmen, must not lose sight of the
fact that the repudiation of Cannon
comes too late to save us from the
Payne-Aldrich bill. Had these same
Democrats and insurgent Republi
cans stood together when the great
tariff fight was on, we could have,
and doubtless would have, had a bet
ter tariff -measure. The best evi
dence that this is true is the fact that
they won hands down at this session
of Congress after the tariff measure
had been saddled upon us. If it had
not been for the twenty-five Demo
crats, all of whom belonged to the
Georgia delegation, they could just
as easily have won before the revis
ion of the tariff, as they -won in the
House a few days ago.
Keep this in mind when you cast
your ballot for Congressman.—Roys
ton (Ga.) Record.
“The Democratic party stands for
Democracy,” is the declaration of the
last National Democratic Convention.
Ask those who are seeking your suf
frage if they are this kind of Demo
crats or the Cleveland-Cannon kind.

All honor to the insurgents; for
while the party man is all right in
the ordinary, it requires men with

IS GEORGIA FITLY REPRE
SENTED?
We stand like the two-headed
Janus. With one face we survey the
past—with the other we gaze into
the future. We study the history of
Georgia’s past Representatives in
Congress—we see the doings of her
Representatives there now. To our
doubtful mind comes the question, is
Georgia fitly represented? We weigh
the importance of this body—we scan
over the past and find such names
as Toombs, Stephens, Cobb, Lump
kin, Crawford, Colquitt and Watson.
Further on down the records we
come, we can’t find her present
Representatives associated with
measures and deeds that would war
rant their return to Congress. They
know it themselves—they are be
coming restless —they are resorting
to every means in an effort to again
fool the people of this great State.
Where are our worthy successors
to Robert Toombs and Alexander H.
Stephens, “the Castor and Pollux of
Georgia politics”? Where are our
worthy successors to Crawford and
Lumpkin, to Cobb and Watson? All
these have served in Congress, and
their footprints are upon the nation’s
legislation. Georgia may have some
men in Congress who are worthy of
the position, but among her Repre
sentatives are some of those traitors
who helped re-elect Cannon as
Speaker of the House. Among them
can be found some of those who
voted a goodly raise in their salaries.
They can be found on the pay-roll,
all right, by a big majority.
Is Georgia fitly represented in the
House of Representatives? This is
a grave question that the voters of
Georgia should consider in the com
ing elections.—Laurens County Her
ald, Dublin, Ga.
