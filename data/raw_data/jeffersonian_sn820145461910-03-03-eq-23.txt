The Public Domain
It is remarkable how many differ
ent journals, and of what diverse
kinds, are denouncing President
Taft’s atrocious proposal to bond the
country for millions and millions of
dollars in order to help the Govern
ment give away, faster and faster,
our public domain, the one national
resource that should be far more
carefully conserved than any other,
for the simple reason that no part
of it once given away can ever be
recovered or replaced. We quoted
last week the New York Sun and the
Outlook, papers about as different
from each other and from the Coun
try Gentleman as possible, as com
ing to the support of the Country
Gentleman view that all this sort of
thing should be stopped; and now
we have a paper of a very different
kind from either of the first three,
The Jeffersonian, published by Mr.
Thos. E. Watson, of Georgia, and
generally recognized, we believe, as
the organ of the Southern “Popu
lists.” This paper says:
“President Taft is doing his ut
most to disarm the suspicion and dis
satisfaction of the West. What does
he do out there, to catch the crowd?
Why, he proposes a national bond is
sue of $10,000,000, to carry on the
irrigation of the dry lands of the
West. Now, isn’t that a flue example
of the absence of the principles of
justice from the policies of the Fed
eral Government? The millions of
merchants, farmers and artisans
throughout the land are to be taxed,
in order that a few thousand West
ern farmers shall have water on
their crops whenever it is needed!
The average agriculturist of the
country has to depend upon the
clouds for rain. Sometimes he gets
too much, and his crops are drowned
out. Sometimes it is just the other
way—they are destroyed by the
drouth. These men must take the
good and the bad crop-years as God
pleases, and do the best that they
can. But Mr. Taft declares that a
bonded indebtedness shall be piled
oh all the people, and that the money
must be applied to irrigating a few
thousand farms, in order that these
favored few shall have water on the
land whenever they want it! For
your supply of farm water, you must
depend upon the weather; for his,
the arid-land farmer will apply to
your pockets. There’s justice for
you! Already those Irrigated farms
get the proceeds of the public land
sales. That money belongs to all;
a few get it. Already those irri
gated arms are a serious menace to
the planter who must depend upon
the clouds for rain. Immensely big
ger yields are taken from the land
which never suffers from too much,
or not enough, moisture. It seems
most unjust, cruelly unfair, to tax
the ordinary farm for the benefit of
the beneficiaries of irrigation. In
fact, the proposition is so monstrous
ly inequitable and selfish that we are
amazed that it should be made. But
the West has got to be soothed, you
see.

“Tens of thousands of farmers are

never a year when hundreds of thou
sands do not have their crops cut off
one-fourth, or one-third, or one-half.
Now, what will be the feelings of

it all —as Adam Sliger has done —if
the Government makes them furnish
all the water needed by the irrigated

A Maligner of Missions
Mr. Toni Watson continues his
diatribe against missionary work, in
his Jefferonian Magazine. Not satis
fied with his quixotic assault on mis
sions, he attempts to attack the char
acter of the missionaries. When con
sidering the animus of this man, it is
well to remember that our dear Uncle
Tom is a discredited and discarded
politician, and as such is naturally
“agin the government.”
Uncle Tom has come about as near
hitting the truth on the mission ques
tion as he did in naming his Populist
paper the Jeffersonian. Uncle Tom is
about the only man we know who
takes Mr. Tom Watson seriously. We
are strongly inclined to look upon
Mr. Watson’s missionary deliverances
as we have always looked upon the
man and his magazine—a huge joke.
Mr. Watson is himself the best argu
ment for the necessity of the mis
sionary.—Western Recorder.
It is so easy to belittle a man
whom you can’t answer, and that is
what the convention papers are try
ing to do with Tom Watson and his
exposure of Foreign Mission meth
ods. The Recorder may think that
Mr. Watson is the only man who
takes him seriously, but he hasn’t
had his ear to the ground if he thinks
so. There are thousands on thou
sands who are satisfied that Mr. Wat
son is telling the truth and the
strongest proof of it is the conduct
of the Baptist papers in maligning
him and then refusing to let him be
heard. Why don’t they refute or
deny what Mr. Watson says of their
conduct of Fuveign Missions? Be
cause they know tliaChe is telling
the truth, and that there is not a
hint in God’s Book for such methods
as theirs. No doubt Mr. Watson will
feel very small when he reads the
opinion of the editor of the Recorder
of himself. Mr. Watson has forgot
ten more than the Recorder man will
ever know and besides he has what
the Recorder man does not carry in
stock, and that is open fairness to
ward every question affecting the
weal or woe of mankind. Oh for a
thousand Watsons to battle against
the wrongs in Church and State. —
Arkansas Baptist.
The Jesuit’s Oath
“I, A. 8., now in the presence of
Almighty God, the Blessed Virgin
Mary, the Blessed Michael the Arch
angel, i the Blessed St. John the Bap
tist, the Holy Apostles St. Peter and
St. Paul and the saints and Sacred
Host of Heaven, and to you, my
Ghostly father, I do declare from my
heart, without mental reservation
that the Pope is Christ’s Vicar Gene
eral and is the true and only Head
of the Universal Church throughout
the earth, and that by virtue of the
Keys of binding and loosing given to
His Holiness by Jesus Christ. He hath
power to depose Heretical Kings,
Princes, States, Commonwealths,
and Governments, all being illegal
without his tiered Confirmation, and
that they may safely be destroyed.
Therefore, to the utmost of my
power, I will defend this doctrine
and His Holiness’s rights and cus
toms against all Usurpers of the
Heretical or Protestant Authority
131) e Jeffersonian
whatsoever, especially against the
now pretended Authority and
Church in England and all Adher
ents in regard that they be Usurped
and Heretical, opposing the Sacred
‘Mother Church of Rome.
“I do renounce and disown any
Allegiance as due to any heretical
King, Prince or State, named Pro
testant, or obedience t oany of their
inferior Magistrates or officers.
“I do further declare the doctrine
of the Church of England, of the
Calvinists, Huguenots and other
Protestants, to be damnable, and
those to be damned who will not for
sake the same. I do further declare
that I will help, assist and advise all
or any of His Holiness’s agents, in
any place wherever I shall be; and
to do my utmost to extirpate the
heretical Protestant doctrine, and to
destroy all their pretended power,
regal or otherwise. I do further
promise and declare, that notwith
standing I am dispensed with to as
sume any religion heretical for the
propagation of the Mother Church’s
interest to keep secret and private
all her agents, counsels as they en
trust me, and not to divulge, direct
ly or indirectly, by word, writing or
circumstance whatsoever, but to exe
cute all which shall be protected,
given in charge or discovered unto
me, by you my ghostly father, or by
any one of this convent.
“All of which I, A. 8., do swear
by the Blessed Trinity, and Blessed
Sacrament which I am about to re
ceive, to perform, on my part to
keep inviolably: and do call on all
the Heavenly and Glorious Host of
Heaven to witness my real inten
tions to keep this my oath. In testi
mony whereof, I take this most Holy
and Blessed Sacrament of the Eu
charist and witness the same further
with my hand and seal, in the face
of the holy convert.”
