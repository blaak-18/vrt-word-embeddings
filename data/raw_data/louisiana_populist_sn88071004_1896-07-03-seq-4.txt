Blood Poison.
Contagious Blood Poison has been ap

It is the one disease that physicians can.
not cure; their mercurial and potash
remedies only bottle up the poison in
the system, to surely break forth in a
more virulent form, resulting in a total
wreck of the system.
Mr. Frank B. Martin, a prominent
jeweler at 926 Pensylvanis Ave., Wash*

I was for a long

of blood poison,

SANG AT AN INDIAN'S GRAVE.
rome Sweet Home" Was First Chanted
Under Peculiar Circumstamees.
When the boundary line between
Tennessee and Georgia was established
it passed half a mile south of the
spring Tuck-a-lee-chee-chee, among
the foothills of the Unakas, and as it
crossed one of the principal Indian
trails it became a place of much im
portance, says the Atlanta Constitu
tion. There had already grown up a
strong rivalry between the Tennessee
tribes, headed by Chief Ross, and the
Georgia tribes, headed by Major Ridge,
both half breeds, and men of extraordl
nary ability as leaders. The etsablish
ment of the new boundary line fixed the
limits of their respective territories,
and to try and harmonize as far as
possible the contending factions the
government established a trading post
there. John Howard Payne appeared
upon the scene and was accused of in
citing the Indians to insubordination.
He was placed under arrest as an in
cendiary and carried to the council
house. The name of the place was
changed from the euphonious appella
tion of Tuck-a-lee.chee-chee to the
one more easily pronounced of Red
Clay because of the color of the soil in
that. vicinity. While Payne was held
there one of the first bands arrived,
and among the Indians was the chief,
Oo-chee, or Rattling Gourd, a broken
hearted man. He was moody and ab
stracted and refused all invitations to
the council house and would partake
of no festive enjoyments whatsoever,
but spent the most of his time at the
graves of his wife and child farther
up the valley. At last one morning
he was missed from his accustomed
place by the camp fire and an alarm
was immediately raised that Rattling
Gourd had escaped. The patrol scat
tered in every direction in search of
him, and some of them bethought them
of his fondness for the spot where his
loved ones slept and went in search of
him there. And there they found him.
Weltering in his own blood, his body
lay between the little mounds that cov
ered his squaw and papoose. In some
way be had secreted a bayonet when
the Indians were being disarmed, and,
brooding over his removal, he became
desperate, and, seeking that lone spot,
he chanted his death song, fell upon
the point of the bayonet, which pierced
his heart, and died on the spot where
he had often expressed a desire to be
laid for his last long sleep. The affair
caused great excitement and indigna
tion. The malcontents took advantage
of the distressing occurrence to stir up
strife and fears were entertained of a
mutiny. A grave was dug on the spot
where he lay, and the chief was buried
by the soldiers, one of the Moravian
missionaries officiating. After the ser
vices were over John Howard Payne,
who had been a silent witness of the
pathetic scene, began singing softly to
himself the song which has since been
echoed through every land on earth.
Gen. Bishop, who had kept a close
scrutiny on his actions, heard the song
and called Payne to him.
"Young man," said the stern old
Indian fighter, "where did you learn
that song?"
"I wrote that song myself," replied
Payne.
"And where did you get the tune?"
"I composed that also."
"Would you let me have a copy of
It?"
"Certainly I will."
"Well, a man who can sing and write
like that is no incendiary. Appear
ances may be against you, but I am
going to set you free. I write out
your discharge immediately d a pass
to anywhere you choose h the
nation."
Payne had been housed the home
of a family living near by.'nd on his
retarn there he exhibited . pass and
related the clrcumstances. That was
the first time that "Home, S..eet Home,"
had ever been sung in publie.

FINALI DISEASlL
Caused by Catarrh of the Pelvie Or-I
gans, Dr. Hartman Says.
If there is a disease which is more
prevalent than all others it is chronic
catarrh. Over half the people have it
in some form or another; and yet prob
ably not a tenth of these people know
that their disease is catarrh.
One person .has dyapepsia; another
bronchitis; another Bright's diseas?;
another liver complaint; another con
gumption; another female complaint.
These people would be very much sur
prised to hear that they are all suf
fering from chronic catarrh. But it is
se. nevertheless. Each of these troubles,
and a great many more, are simply
catarrh-that is, chronic inflammation
of the mucous lining of whichever or
gan is affected. Catarrh of the pelvic
organ is a very common kind of
catarrh which leads to a condition
known as female disease. Nearly
every woman who has female com
plaint is a victim of catarrh of the
pelvic organs. These women should
write to Dr. Hartman, Columbus, Ohio,
a description of their symptoms and
he will gtvo prompt answer with direc
tions for treatment free.
Any Internal remedy that will cure
catarrh in one location will cure it in
any other location. This is why Pc
ru-na has become so justly famous
in the cure of female diseases. It
cures catarrh wherever located. Its
cures remain. Pe-ru-na does not pal
liate; it cures. Send to Dr. Hartman
for a free book on female diseases.
Cheap Eggs.
Eggs are selling at 20 cents a dozen
at Tucson, Ariz..and it is the first time
in the history of the place that they
have been so cheap. From 75 cents to
$1 has been the ruling price.
There is something pleasant in being
innocently accused.
A most effective remedy for sheep
scab and ticks is a preparation of pure
nicotine prepared from tobacco. Own
ers of sheep generally are using it in
stead of lime, sulphur and arsenic and
seem unanimous in believing that sheep
ticks and scab will soon be totally ex
terminated. Nicotine is a deadly poi
son to insects, but when diluted for
dipping does not affect animals. In
this respect it differs from the mineral
poisons. The Skabcura Dip Co. of Chi
cago are the largest manufacturers of
nicotine in the world.
Edison's Latest.
'r. Edison has invented an appa
ratus which changes the X ray into
light. He says that the light so pro
duced is exactly the same as the sun
light. He thinks that he has found a
better and cheaper light than the in
candescent lamp.
The New England Conservatory of Music, in
oston,Mass., has furnished instruction to over
60,000 pUpLs since 1858,and its popularity as an
institution of the highest excellence is con
stantly increasing. Its curriculum is not con
Lxed to music alone, but Oratory and Modern
Languages have finely equipped departments
and the best instructors mosey can procure.
Special sttention also is given to instruction in
pianoforte tuning. The charges are low when
compared with those of other musicalschools.
