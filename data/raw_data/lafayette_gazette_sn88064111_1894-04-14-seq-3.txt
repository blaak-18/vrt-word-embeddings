pleasing satisfaction of kno Ring that
he has done his duty well, possessing

also due much credit for the syste

which the office has been conducted
under its present management.
e The Lake Charles Exoursion.
To say that the excursion last
Sunday was crowded is putting it
to mildly, fully two-thirds of the excur
sionists being compelled to remain
standing. Seeing that it was impos-. 1
r sible to get a seat many people got ju
d off the train at this station and a
number went as far as Jennings, but t
refused to go any furtherand returned
to theit houses on the regular pas
senger. There were so many peo- as
ple on board that the conductor a
failed to collect fate from quite a
number of them, but enough was col- Uo
lected to make the excursion a very
h prfitable enterprise for the Hook
and Ladder company of Franklin, C°
i under whose auspices it was given. se
In one of the coaches there was not ha
a particle of light during the trip PC
' coning back. Upon being informed
of this the conductor replied that wl
the lamps would not stay lit as long
as the doors were left open. Be it
as it may, it is certainly very incon- r "
venient and disagreeable for people
to ride 80o or 90 miles standing inr
a car as dark as the infernal regions. so

our people will remember as a fill
highly interesting piece, abounding fra

Several cases of hydrophobia Mr

The Judge's Charge.
11 Monday mornial the session of I
the jury term of c~urt commenced
and the Grand Jury being organized,
h- Judge Allen delivered his charge
reviewing the imlprtant part the
Ul grand jurors were talled upon to
e take in the administration of the
a criminal laws of the State and in
the investigation, which it was their i
duty to make in tht condition of
n the public schools, of the public
roads and in the disbursement of the -
it public moneys, and in the
financial condition of the parish: t
In clear, forcible and impressive
words the judge shtuwed how futile h
the efforts of the state attorney
s and of the court wOuld be to bring |
the violators of the law to trial and Y
E of those charged vith the exercise I
;d of public trusts to the bar of public '
opinion for neglect of duty or for
violation of theit trusts, if the grand
jurors were derilict in the discharge
of the importait duties, which
Utnder their oath they are called a
upon to perform.
We regret that We can not pub- iv
t lish in extense the charge of the L
judge to the grand jury. Those
a who heard it were impressed with al
it the idea that this government was n'
intended to be a government of law,
and the safest way to maintain it, t
and secure the liberty and the right tc
of property of the citizen was to
upheld obedience to the mandates a=
of the writen law of the land. in
We were much pleased with the lii
comments of Jdtige Allen on the th
semi-barbarous habit that some men to
have of carrying on or about their
persons concealed weapons. out of di
which springs most of-the homicides of
which annually occur in the State. m
The constitution of the United
t States guarantees to every man the C;
right to carry weapons but let him
do so openly., In the carrying of se
a concealed weapon on one's per
son there is something that smacks PV
of cowardice and treachery. la!
