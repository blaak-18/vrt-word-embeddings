Some of the men who an't steand
the work are dying by Inches. There
Is George Hart, in for ten years for
highway robbery, and Bebe Lacoste,
who are perfeet skeletons. John
Patterson, a healthy man about
twenty-five years old, who went up
for two years for petty larceny, died
from tII treatment.
Ben Berkery was killed some time
ago, He came up with the last batcb
of convicts, in August, I think. He
had been sentenced to ten years'
hard labor for forgery, hut the sen
tence was commuted to one year.
He was put to work to clear land on
Judge Cordoell's plantation on a
Tlhrsdav.
Monday he asked Lieut. Wallace
if he could stop work for ten minutes
as he was broken down. Wallace WI
said he would get the strap if he did. COI
IBerkery said it did not matter as he 1I1
would die anyway. H4 tried to run I
and a guard snapped his gun at him.
He was captureil, and got .;4 lashes.
They put a chain on him and made
him work. On Tuesday Berkery
asked Wallace again if he could rest.
Wallace said he would be killed if he
did.
"You will have to do it, then; nla
the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost, amen!" ried
Berkery, and he ran about lfta NUT
yards and fell dead, has body riddled 0
with buckshot from the gun of one
of the guards.
I The ex-convtlt said thes were MIY
some examples of the way the coo.
vioets were treated. They were com.
polled to work from sunrise to sun
I set. Their food was sufficient in Am
uantity, but such things as knives. late
forks and spoons were unknown.
The narrator said the work was of a
most laborious kind, and that some
r times the men were up to their knees
in the mud. He pointed out the sores
on his legs caused by this kind of Ia.
bor. The system, he thought, was
calculated to make desperate erimi
nals of the best inclined men, as they A
were east among thieves, murderers
and utterly corrupt felons, and those of A
who desired to reform could not es- by h
