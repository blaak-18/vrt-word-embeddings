peoile, it has flotislhed amnid t'own

leading colntry jonrn;il of the State.

the rate of H per cent were dlmand

payers had been pinndered to the ex

dared not lift their voices, even in re

robbery being perpetrated shameless

for sale under the tax gatherer's ham

ed tearfully in the ganut eyes and

its voice cheered the lpeople ; bade
thenm take courage and led the ran to
victory, a victory priceless beyoind
name, and which was won by the few
patriots of this parish and State des
pite the open opposition of enemies,
the treason of seeming friends and
clamois of timid cowards.
It is hat reasonable that the PEO
Pr.E's VIN~DI'ATOR should feel a just
pil, int its share of the noble wormk,
ian it i- .A+l!l mIore than honest and
honorable exnitationl of heart that we
refer to it. IIn that dark hour tihe
VINDICATOR was the people's friend
-it was fearless in its denunciation
of men and nets. It never for a mo
ment faltered in the good work.
What it then was, it has been, is to
day and will be to the end of its ex
is'ence. We are fully aware that
there are men who do not ridmire the
VINDIC.\Ton and the lack of their ap
plause is a value to its influence anti
an evidence of its honor. Those who
are our enemies are well known; how
they became so is chronicled in the
history of radical villainy.
It shall be our aim to endeavor to
continue them in the roll of enmity,
and to that end we will on all occa
sions that may arise endeavor to "im
mortalize their infamy."
To our good people; people who
have bourn with our shortcomings
and trusted us for'our patriotism, we
extend a cerdil greeting on this our
4th anniiVers:iry; from them we ask
the continuance of that noble and
disinterested confidence hlitherto re
posed in us. With that the Vrsr)c.\
TO'rll hopes in time to stand, in the
journalistic fiolhl of Louisiana, a pow
er second to none in the State.
Whlat a contrast between Governor
IlHampton amnl P. MI. Gen. Keys ! The
nobleman anil the flunky are strik
ingly illustrated in the two men.
Governor HIamptonu tells tilel Illinoise
people, lie fougit themn and has no
apologies to makefor rt, while Keys
pleads tile bnhSy act on every stump.
Our frienlds must not think us set
fish because we must in future tle

After we have pernsed andi scissored
them we have no objectiom to their
being taken firom thle office; in the
mean time any and all our friends are
invited to read in our office to tlhes
heart's content.

We were utterly astonnded at the
N. O. Democrat in advocating such a
achemeni as a commission to draft a
constitution or amendments thereto.

of Tom Anderson to be general

TlE man who would attempt to
talk of Hayes as a b,-ight particular
deity after ihis having retained Mat
WVelle in, and appointed Tom Andtr
son to office, is very easily eatisfied
with his style of gods,
The stream never rises higher than
its source, consequently there can be
no good government in Louisiana
until we have a pure foumtdation.
Reforms with a rotten constitution
are impossible !
IT is not so much in high salariet
paid to officials thai reins us as it is
the multiplicity ofoffices. This par
ilh has now 391 ward and parish of
ticials, including all. A good gov
craument could be earried on with less
than half that number. .
" ..l pi'f !e oft . is. p:i is! have l.ean
n, used to seeing a P'olice Jury in

per ty or naferiai interests, that they

U ho could he selected, the prloperty,
: virte alnd intelligence of this cum
tnIun ity.
VWe still see good, well meaning men
talking., (f, and acting towards this
l'olive JiurV, as if they were i hods of
alien rnlers, or one of the nsann ladi
cnl 'Police Bodies that have hitlierto
disti:nced, as well as pillaged the
pai kh. It is certainly wrong that
i've ry ant, intended solely for the
public good, ~hould be uret with bit
ter and hostile attack; that every
policy innugurated for the benefit of
Sthe parish, should be made the sub
ject of opposition without trial. If
the Ipeople of .atelhitoches, patient
and long suf ti ing under ills which at
Iatst cul nii;iated u i resistance withl
:t its, and evenrr then patriotic iand
honest, propose to be sneering, cap
tions, and in opposition to their own
friends, then no man who va'dlues his
honor w nt iconsent to sErve thein.
We find onistlves loaded with
debt, incurred, it is true, by hadieal
thieves, and for no apparent good or
pnrpose; we find our household tnrn
ed topsy turvy upon our return to it,
and the Police Jury propose to do all
they can to pay off the one and set
the other to rights. Not one single
tdishonest debt will be paid; not one
c single dollar will be expended in pay
n Irent of ought but honest, legitimate
expenses, and all the Police Jury asks
is the honest, faithful, cheerful co
operation of the Democratic tax
payerls of this parish--all they de
sire is, to at least give those measures
proposed for thoe public good, an
honest, fair trial before condemnation.
If this be done, each member of the
'Police Jury will pledge himself that
there will be no complaint in the
e end, and the taxpayer can rest as
a sured his welfare is in the safe keep
ing of honest gentlemen, the wisdom
of whose policy and acts time will
fiully vindicate.
-Grant Parish.
Our Special Correspondent from
t it3 above named parish, a gentleman
Sof standing and varacity, tellsus some
Sstartling news relating to official
I abuses practiced by those who are
o supposed 'to be the servants of the
people. As the District Attorney
c pro tern seems mixed up in the mat
ter, would it not be well to have
Jurdge Blackman, of Rapides, give
the Governor some official hint of
this malfeasance. We feel assured
- thie Judge will do so when hris atten
tion is called to it, and we have no
a doubt that Governor Nicholls will
s lift thie Grant parish rolilihers out of
>their boots-officially speakinrg.
r Seriously, this is a grave charge,
k and it should at once be looked into.
I Grant parish has been a "sore spot"
- for years, aniid we think the Govern
- or, Jtdgt IBlackman, or District At
e torniey lun!ter, shonld investigate at
once, and bring theso parties, if guil
ty, to punishment. If Democratic
officials are allowed to rob tihe people
they will not lie long in ridding them.
selves of Democracy, and we demand
that thie party shall at least disown
tire robbers.
SWHAT must we think of a journal
5 that favors the education of thIe negro
but opposes the white man teachling
htim. Tile Enuterprise, published in
thie parishl of St. Laudry, says in re
gardt to teaching:
"Educating thn negroes is some
I thing that we are in fiavor of, bullt we

thie ''degradation" but in thire "sillrir"

eyes of thiis "lender of public opinl

ilg it for nothing a "degradation."

A (Good Point.
The telegraph, not long since,
was imade to say that, "Senator
Spefford, of Louisiana, was ar
Sranging for a conltest for his seat
Sin thie United States Senate, at his

paper not a thousand miles from
this, remarked, "that Senator

We think the object of those who
propo.lse the plan above stated is plain
lv discernile,. As to the plan it is
lundeinocratic, as totally inpllr'actic
able as any \e have yet heard of. As
to the 1notives which actuated its
proposal, th'hey are apparent.
For a long time many reiall good
and well nitafiling men in Louisiana
thought. and for that matter still
think, that we should so triml our
conduct in this State as to wiln at
least the silence of the Northern Iad
ical. The States of the South that
had the preponderating number of
these mlen renmainled longer ntlder
railical boil)dage anld Ilwhen out will
lie longer reachiig honest govern
nment and prosperity.
IAt any person in every day life so

Now these meni object to a consti

as long as we continuel thus in lead
ing stRlilgs, thus shin thling ailolt in
order to temper aniid tine ourselves
to tile capriciousness of tlihe kllaves of
that party, just so long will tlhere be
mnllrlurs and complaints at home.
The constitution effects Louisiana
alone and her people are made or un
made by it. Then what is the use of
this eterinail truckle to "what the
North says," or any one else oultsile
the State for that matter.
We favor a constitutional conven
tion because there ca:n lie no such
thing as reformi, tcv,,i,:m v and good
governnleit hoped foi in this State
until we have an honest constitution I
As well might we expect figs to grow
on thistles.
Let the coun try press cease not in
their efforts to Iring about this con
vention. If we fail with the present
Legislatlre we will elect one in 1878
which will truly represent public sent
imient.
E. A. llitKl:, in his denial, simply
confli nts what the Sun's corl'espol
dent charged hin with. It appears
that lie did talk to the correspondent
with regard to his visit to the Pres
ident, and ) to the eorrespondent withl
regard to Wells and Anderson's trial
andl the spiriting away of witnesses.
Mr. Burke says that hlie told the cor
respondent that the "'spiriting away;'
was "rumored" in New Orleans. This
is strange, when the city press is thlere
to report such grave rumors if they
were current.
Mr. lnike hald just dined with the
President when tile Sun'a correspon
dent came upon him anid we have an
exhibition iln rino rerits. Mr. lirke
should have reported these runmors to
tile nearest magistrate befora he left
New Orleans, as heli must have believ
ed tliey were founded on something
more than idle gossip else lie would
have not repeated them, and that
magistrate would have ordered an in
veetigation at once. Brown's fulsame
card settles the matter. Who in tlhe
nlmlle of IHercules is Brown I exclaims
nine-tenths of Louisianians.
Public opinion is all but strength
ened in its first expression and will
be clamorous for an investigation,
which they are filly satisfied will
never be accorded. Hlowever, the
people can patiently wait until they
can be heard in propria persona.
Keyes-the Gallant Warrior.
Kcves' war record is something
like Bill Arp's story of the last
Confederate Congress, the mem
bers of which Arp heard were to
hav-e been disfranchised by the
Fedtleral government for hlaving
"aitded and abettedl those who
were in rebellion." Bill Arp said
there was certainly a mistake in
thile charge, for if the last Confede
rate Congress had ever aided the
rebellion or the rebels, nobody
down South had ever heard of it
So it is with Keys, if he ever
killed any Yankees with that rip
snorting East Tennessee regiment
of his, there is no record of the
fact in history. The harm he did
the "Uniiion and the flag" "ain't
worth 'poligizin for."

Bradley Not the Sun's Mfeat !
'I'lThe last sensation is that it is pro
posed by the I)emocrat s to appoint a

Maleanley tells us, that the reaction
in 'f vor of (Chales I of Etigland, aft
ter Parliament had partly corrected
the abuse of power b"y mncn repr'e
senting the tyrant Charles, was so
great that the Englishl people came
near losing their liberty thereby. In
other words, Macanley, Nugent and
Clarendon, leave us the impression
that virtue in office in those days had
begun to bie sneered at as a sentiment
unworthy of cultittion; happily,
however, for mankind, and more so
for (onstitutional government, ilamp
den and l'ymm, were powerful enough
to check this growing tendency to
embrace the monster vice, whose
frightful mien had been so often be
held as not to terrify.
Are we not very unOtly in the same
condition as England, so far as re
gards Constitutional ahnses, was in
those days i And is not this reaction
dangerous to our liberty and to so
cietyv
We know the Editor of the Demo
erat too well to implgn his motives,
but we must beg to differ with hillm,
when lie says the "South has more
inmpo tan t topics on hand ,just now"
than the punishment or disgrace of
vile oflicnals. No more important
mission could or can be assumed by
a people than a correction of Con
stitutional abuses, or the punishment
of those who, h igh in o flicial position
have violated the laws of the land,
:;ind the rights of thle people. The
effolrts and success of llampden and
his colleagues will be referred to with
pride and honor so long as time lasts;
the!j resisted the King in his viola
tion of the Constitution, when, had
they consulted their case and per
hops listened to the promptings of
personal interest, it would have been
best to have yielded.
Bradley is not "the ,nn's meat ;" on
the contrary, he, and all connected
witll him, deserve, not only the exe
cration of Americans, but condign
punishment for the foul wrongs per
petrated ly tliem under the guise of
an honorable compact. Let Bradley
be the "meat" of all honest citizens
of this country ; let us, while build
lig uip our fmtunes, bnild up at the
same time a pure and honest civil so
ciety, for we can rest assured there
will be no real prosperity until thlis
purity in government takes place.
Above all, we beg Southern jour
nals to discard this growing tenden
cy, confined hitherto to the "'loyal
North" to sneer at virtuous patriot
ism, and to laugh down any thing
that is not based on money. VWe
least expected such expressions from
the DT'wrel, hence our protest, ut
tired :lmore in sor'row than in anger.
Prl:;ident Hlayes, d(1iJeto, is
toiiing South to give us an op
lportunity to show him a little
(Confederate '"gush." The 'repub
licaniism of our fathers is sadly
degenerated when "all creation"
turns out to pIay homage to a man
who takes an office through a
violation of the Uonstitution and
the rights of a people--and who
appoints snuch carcasses as Tom
Anderson to office. But then he
is going to give us the Pacific
Railroad and the Mississippi
Levees, and that is the modern
salve for "lacerated liberty and
wounded honor."
We tlhink the Tribune is wrong
in its abuse of Stanley Matthews
and the Communistic Republican
plantform of Ohio, A careful
study of the State platforms of
all the parties, Rei)ublican, DI)em.
ocrat, Greenback, Workingmen,
&c, will show them to be specious
utterances to catch votes, and
without an iota of principle to
stand upon. In one State the
party calls for free trade, and in
another for protection ; in one the
demand for the dollar of our dads
is vociferated with a vimm which
is perfectly deafening, while the
roar for speedy resumption and a
gold tender, is equally loud in
another. There seems to be a sad
lack of plrincilples in all parties
and their platforms are to all ap.
pearance, things of "shreds and
patches."
We will continue to publish the
receipts of cotton tlhis, as we have
done in previous winters. An epi
tome of market doings-the stage
of the River, with rates of freight,
will be carefully compiled each week
and our friends can rest assured they
will find the market column of the
VINDICATOR useful and interesting.
The majority for the Republicans in
Maine is reported instanter, while the
Democratic majotity in California is
