TIlE SIiIEVEPORT TIM'I.
MEMPHIS, August II.--A special
dispatch to the Appeal from IHeleena
(Ark.) received at 8:30 a. m., says:
At 11. o'clock last night three lAdiBes
and two :gentlmen arrived here from
Aastip in a skiff, audi reported that
considerable fighting occarregl yeste
day evening. The coinaudmer of the
post, whose name we did not learn,
dispatched a stout of twenty-five men
on the madiaoCold Waeor Station, on
the Mississippi and Tennessee road,
and captured a picket of negroes, who
were stationed about two miles from
town, and brought them in as pris
oners. They were being put into the
court-house yard when one tried, to
make his escape. lie was fired upon
and killed, and in the melee which
followed another negro was wounded,
but no fatally.
In the evening a larger body of ne
groes advanced fromi the south and
attaekbd the town, driving in the
white skirmishers to the court
house, where the main body of whites
were stationed. ci hawrg. was ange'
by the whifes, hnid 'te negroes wero
repnlstd, with a loss of several killed
and wounded. The fighting was go-
ISgison when our informant .left, and:
they were .ired upon a thfy creosed
over to Chip Island.

vea hIaadre4,l the whites1. have
abo~ut:two hunred. Both parties are
expecting reinforcements. At present
the whites have the best of it. The
negro hands, on the plantations op
posite, in Agkansas, are arming and
marching on Austin in largoe 'numbers;
Memphis, August 12.--A aliecial to
the Avalanche from Helena, dated
noon, says in a .fight at Austin last
night eightor ten negroes were killed.
Rein forceiudtit ' are coming in to
the'*hites, and'the negroes are being
ref teed from the hurrounding coun
; tr hp., ,T'!h' whites have Austin bar
rjicaed'iad will probably be able to
liee~the negroes of, libat they need
assistance in provisions and ammuni
tion. Several officials from 'runica
county have been here since yester
day morning and telegraphed to Gov.
Ames at Jackson for assistance, but
up to this time have heard nothing.
This special also states that the whites
have taken O K Landing, somen three
miles below Austin, the only landing
in that vicinity at this stage of water.
This is corroborated by the officers
of the H. C. Yeager, which arrived
here to-night and who saw a body of
armed white men there as they passed
LATpsT. - Captain James Lee, of
the steatmer St. Frances, which ar
rived from below this morning, says
that after the negroes who lhad Austin
surrounied were repulsed yesterdav,
they di d eared, and the story soon
circulhted that they were rpnrdering
women and children left unpirotected
on the suriounding plantations, which'
caused the men who had been defend
;i the ldcee to start for their homes
toprotect their families, and Austin
was soon left without defenders,
except one or two white wen .,and
the negroes came in and took' posses- 1
sion and proceeded to break open the 1
saloons and stores and help thiem
selves. At last accounts they had
committed no acts of violence towards
c the fetw whites who were unable to
getaway, but they were becominig
drunk, and fears' were entertained
that 'they would burn the village.
Messengers were sent to Capt. Lee
asking him to land there, but he had
ts' large number of recruits on board;
somd of whom the negroes had thdeat- t
ened to kill, Dr. Phillips, late Repub.
lican member of the Legislature being
one of the number, and as they beg.
ged him not to do so, he passed on I
'p without4landing. Gen Chalmers
canto up od the steamer St. F'rancis
to Peter's landing where the Saint .1
Francis met the White with reinforce
ments from here. He was requested I
by the deputy sheriff in tirhe absence 1
of the sheriff, ,to take conmmand of
the men and he went back with them. e
They will land at 0. K. landing and
endeavor to cut off the retreat, of the
negroes from the hills and doubtless f
ere this the whole force has been cap- t
tured. The negroes had no suspicion It
of the .opproach of this force and c
were t6o busily'engag ed iii debauch
to'be prepared to meet themi Gen. t
.Calmers is a man of well known coar- c
aogetad ouolness and his being in .
Qoopand gives assurance that no a
blood Will be 'unnecessarily shed. It
Is "proper to state that politics has i
nothing to do with this trouble.

.The excitement hero in regard to C
the rit at Austin is becoming more
intense, owing to unfounded rumors
that young men of this city have been
killed in an attack on the place. The C

Vicksbarg has fallen a second time.
Out of the hands of white 1adicant

The use of the house, which lie dLcs

ty of their use is part of his inlcoume
