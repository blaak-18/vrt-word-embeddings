Taxes ought not to be *uid, in

is needed to defray the expenses of

It is better and safer to leave
their money with the people than
to take it and hoard in the treasury,
for it is always time to get it when
it is needed for the public good.
It is preferable to have a rich
people and a poor government,
than to have a rich government,
and a poor people.
Thomas H. Benton said that
protection by the government of the
Unite States, made the North rich
and the South poor, and this is true,
because protective legislation can
not make one class of people rich,
without, at the same time, make
another class poorer in proportion;
because the government has no
money to give except what it gets
from the mass of taxpayers.
The essential characteristic of a
free man is that independence which
results from a reliance upon his own
resources and labor, and his inde
pendence weakens as he suffers him
self to depend on another to supply
his wants; likewise with a free peo
ple, whenever they seek and crave
the patronage or protection of
Government to enrich themselves,
they lose in proportion that charac
teristic independence, which distin
guishes a citizen from the subject.
When priests and preachers, in
this land of unlimited liberty
of conscience, forsake their
calling to go into politics, they gen
erally turn ignorant statesmen and
broilers of the peace of the country,
by sapping with the infernal doctrine
of intolerance, that fraternal feel-
ing,whichaccording to philosophy as
well as christianity, is the corner
stone of human felicity.
B. 0. Flower's paper on "*Early Environ
ment in Home Life" in the September Aresna
is a plea for a larger measure of common
sense and justice being exerci.ed toward
young folks growing into maturity by
parents and guardians in regard to the
proper.functions of their bodies, and the
relations of the sexes. It also shows the
destiny-shaping force of the moral ideas in
the atmosphere in a child's early years, and
loving care and intelligent sympathetic home
surroundings and education can overcome or
mitigate even bad hereditary tendencies.
Beauty and truth, high ideals and example
and candor about all those physicial facts of
life so freighted with moral perils is MIr.
Flower's ideal, of education for children.
He believes parents do not feel their respon
sibilities enough; they think the whole of
education is school books and the Sunday
school. The greatest influences of all are in
the daily lives and thoughts of the parents.

On the 9th instant there will be
an excursion from Thibodaux to St.
Martinville where elaborate prepar

place who wish to visit St. Martin
ville on that day can go to New
Iberia on the early train and then
take the excursion train, returning to
the latter place in time to board
the night train for this town.
Hon. Thos. S. Adams, Secretary
of State, is prominently mentioned
as a candidate for Congress in the
sixth district. There is not a public
man in Louisiana for whom The
Gazette entertains a higher regard
than the present secretary of State,
and should the voters of the Sixth
district elect him as their represen
tative at Washington, they will have
a Congressman who is a sintcere
friend of the masses, and one who
has the ability and honesty to make
a good representative.
