Governor WILTz has, sine his re.
turn from the North, developed his
pleas ass Governor, whloh aut com
mend themselves to the right-thblnk
lIg public, as well a eniot their
hearty support. Muh has been said
of "rnlog men sad f poitlcal admials
tratln;" It has all been said for a
political purpose, however, and Gov
ernor Wutz will convince all men,
except those who proposed to fight.
him from the start, that hbis promises
and pledges have been and will be
kept.
On the 25th Instant, the Governor
issued a call to the steamboat men
requesting them to meet him In con
ference nla order to lower the rates of
freights and passage. Afterwards he
calls upon the railroad men, and all
other classes of busineas men aIn New
Orleans, so as to bring about a per
feet understandinag between shippers
and traasportatlon liaes, and between
the merchbants and planters of the
country and the merohants of the
olty.
This is a new and important ro-e
for theGovernor of a State to assme,
and must convince the material Inter
sets of "Louisiana that Governor
Wm rz Is alive to their needs.
The people of LouIsiana have been
educated to believe that their mate
rdal prosperity depends up6n political
legislation, and so long as they con
tinue to act upon that assumption
there will be discontent, and nothing
but discontent. That bad legislation
will nlajure clvil communities no well
read person will deny. but, tosuppose
that an extreme of what is called by
political harples, "people's legisla
tion" will not produce bad effects, lI
to fly In the face of all erperlenae.
The New Constitution needs no leg
islative Interpretation. Every artlole
has received all the vitality which an
Ausembly san lvelt. All that is now
required is Judicial intefpretation,
and our courts should at once apply
themselves to the task.
Meanwhile the Governor propomee
to add the mightof his posldtln and
experience to that of the private eiti.
Iasuof the State In advanlcng private
eterprises by private means; of
blteing and encouraging agricl
stre, commerce and manuatures,
to the end that Louisiana may reach
material greatness, as other States
have reached it, through the efforts
of eldtsens whom the law does not re
strict In anything, save and except to
Interfere with the right of other eltlh
seas to pursue the race for wealth In
their own way.
The Virginta Squabble.
Our Democratic friends In Virglnla
have not secured any advantage with
right-thinlaing men In their recent
conference with the AdJusters. Our

Spirit of theamatry Pr..', a
Some of our confreres grow elo.0
quent over the Press Oonvention.
Our much loved contemporary the
Gretna Courier, says in relation 1
thereto: a
Provisional President H. J. . ams
of the West Baton Rouge _Suja
Planter, has h ed the second Jon
day of October--eing the 11th day of
that month-for the time of asemb- I
lng of the Press Oobventlon of Lou
slans, at Baton Rouge. Let every
paper In Loistana, oity and corny
be represented In that body, either In
person or by proxy. It is or the most
vital Importance to the newspaper
interest of the country. We should
all meet as a band of brothers -as I
we are-without distinction of party
and adopt measures that will te
dound to our interests, and serve to
build up a press within the borders I
of our State. that will reflect credit 4
on the profession and each individa- I
al member. Let the city and coun
try unite in their efforts to make the '
coming press convention a grand
success, and then we will all be hap
py, prosperous and can work with a
will in restoring our State to her
former good standing in the great
confederacy of States.
Our rural friend of the Blenville
Times should, from his nrroundings,,
"loan to virtue's side," but alas, he
Isike the majority of mankind-who
take assertions for proof. The
"evils" whclh have reduced taxation
from al mills to 6 mills aur very hard
to bear It is true-but we digress
The Times has this to say on the side
of Butler, of Blenville." Ogden's say I
will be in its next issue:
Our Representative, Mr. Butler is
about the ony man who has sooken
out "openly and above board" re
lative to the rottenness and corrup
tion of the Rings in New Orleans
and also of some of the omielals of
the State. We are pleased to see
that his remarks at the mass meet- I
lag here meet the hearty approval of
some of the leading papers of North
Louisiana. Wherever the lines are
as closely drawn as Mr. Butler drew
them here, men are compelled to
take a stand either for or against
the evils that have weighed us down,
lo these many years.
Col. Hay's Guardian, whose "watch
and ward" le' between us and the
Arkanmaw repudiators, has an eagle
eye to the good of the poor publish
ers of newspapers throughout the
State. To that end It winds up may
truthful statements with this idea:
There is no oncertof action among
aublishers, and we doubt if anry an
be baid. There are thosnd of l
manufacturers who are getting all
their country advertising done for
nothing by the due bill swindle; not
a swindle either, for a publisher need
not accept unless he wishes. Thbi is
the way tl goes: An organ firm, for
instance, propose to advertise with
as to the amount of ifty dollars.
They give a due bill for fifty dollars,
which when presented with seventy.
Ave dollars ln cash, will be taken for
what they call, in their circular to
you, a one hundred and twentyfive
dollar organ. A cash purchaser can
buy that organ from them for $75.
Thbis is the fact ,,bout all the due
bill advertisements. The idea of a
publisher ilinag his paper with these
tblhgs to the prejudice of his readers
is an outrage.
We need to protect ourselves. A
mntinuation of the practices that
have prevailed for so long will put
the coautr press beneath coatempt
,from flmnss pointL of view. We
have eoeavored to stem the cnrrrent
and have always found that when we
were Arm, yet reasonable, the ado
vertiser came to terms.
OCa a Pres Assoclation regulate
Smatters of this klind 9? If we are at
the meeting we sbhall make a trial to
elevate the aountry press and to pro.
vide some way to punish the rats.
