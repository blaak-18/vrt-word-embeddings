RSJTOLATO ,O.,
MR. OAWLISLE* wOlit. V
Nolas". Pralepls Appued to atolese"
The seeret.ry of the treasury, in the tl
brief period for w ~loh he has had con
trol of the department, has conducted 1
it in a manner that has . distinctly -
strengthened publi confidence as to his e
financial poliJy, while his general ad- t
ministration has been marked by ahigh R
degree of intelligence, sound judgment
and practical capacity. He entered C
upon his task with peuliar difficulties
left by the late administration, thechief i
of which was a general uneasiness in 0
the "public mind created by the varied 0
and confused talk constantly issuing .
from the officials of the department, to R
which it must be said that the late see- a
retary contributed his share. These 0
utterances gave the impression on the r
one hand, that the departmedt officers s
felt themselves in a trying and possibly
a serious situation, and, on the other,
were quite at sea as to how it should be 1
dealt with. To this Mr. Carlisle has put
a stop. He is known to have a clear
idea of his responsibilities to the pub
lie arising out of the unsound condition c
of the currency laws; but he recognizes a
no responsibility for the effect of chang- E
ing ponditions in the money market,
does not worry about them, does not C
talk, especially in public, of them, but :
quietly pursues his own way. keeping
the requirements of the treasury and
those alone in mind. He has, of course, 1
been fortunate in that the demand for
currency in the west has brought gold '
into the treasury, while the higher '
rates for money here have checked the
export of gold, but he is to be credited
with the quiet, sensible and reassuring
spirit in which he has met the situation,
for that has gone far to help on the res
toration of confidence.
In the matter of appointments and
the management of the department
service it is not unfair to Mr. Carlisle to
say that he has shown a clearer under
standing of the principles which Mr.
Cleveland represents and a firmer ad
herence to them than might have been
expected of him. He was the first, and
so far he is the only, head of depart
ment to cause the record of all applica
tions for appointment to be opened to
the public, and that is a measure of
great importance, and one that might
well be adopted throughout all branches
of the executive departments. The ap
pointments made under him have been
of a high character and some of them
have shown a conspicuous devotion to
purely public interests and inde
pendence of partisan claims. His
prompt and firm announcement that
the lighthouse and life saving services
should be kept entirely free of politics
and that those employed in them should
be judged entirely by their merits was
an impressive lesson in sound business
administration. The plan he is clearly
pursuing, gradually and carefully to
weed out unnecessary or unfit em
ployes, to cut off extravagant expendi
tures and to hold the various branches
of the service to a strict business ac
countability is in the same line. We
gave an instance of it recently in the
information furnished by the treasury
department as to the "allowances"
made in connection with the Behring
sea arbitration.
It is particularly fortunate that we
have the evidence which we possess of
the conservative and practical adminis
tration of the treasury department, be
cause it indicates that Secretary Car
lisle knows how to organize his work so
as to leave him free for the proper study
and consideration of the more important
duties that he will have to perform.
These will be complex and difficult.
The forces that tend to embarrass and
threaten the treasury in the mainten
ance of gold payments have been
checked, but they have not been de
stroyed, and cannot be by any executive
action. Later Mr. Carlisle will have to
deal with them. The tariff question,
both as to the effect of changes upon
the revenue and as to the safe and
thorough application of the principles
by the people, is one as to which the
guidance of the secretary of the treas
ury will be at once necessary and valu
able. Mr. Carlisle will be able to meet
the requirements of his high post in
these regards much more satisfactorily
to himself and with greater advantage
to the administration, the democratic
party, and the country, to the extent
that he succeeds in applying business
principles to the organization and con
duct of his office.-N. Y. Times.
REPUBLICANS RALLYING.
The 0. 0. P. Is Now Doing AU the Shout
ing and Perspiring.
As long as Harrison was in the white
house threatening the country with his
policy of radicalism the democrats were
united and aggressive all over the
United States. But now that they have
in the white house a man in whose hon
esty of purpose they have entire con
fidence they are devoting much less at
tention to politics and more to private
business.
The result is clearly seen in the late
western town elections. There is no
mistaking the meaning of them, as it is
everywhere plain on the face of the re
turns. The democrats are not taking
nearly as much interest in politics as
they did last year, while the republic
ans are taking more.
This was to be expected. It is pos
sible that in the west at least the re
publican party might have been finally
demoralized if in its national policies
the democratic party had been pre
pared to assert its principles and vindi
cate its traditions at every point of the
line. This, however, it was not prepared
to do. Its national policy is thoroughly
and positively democratic in the matter
of tariff reform, but in nothing else in
that practical way that enlists the en
thusiastic cooperation of democratic
voters who have no axes to grind and
who are not applicants for office. The
theories of the party platform are all
that theories ought to be, but until
they become the vitalizing spirit of
party policies they are mere barren
idealities.
They are foolish who expected that
the republican party could be disor
ganized on the single issue of tariff
reform. That is a great issue, it is
true, but to give the rank and file of
the democratic party the enthusiasm
Ihat wins great and lasting victories it
must have one of two things--either an
opponent in power who tramples in the
most ruthless way on all it holds sacred,
or else a leader who is in thorough
sympathy with it, who has a quick and
intuitive perception of its thoughts,
desires and aspirations.
In Harrison, democrats had an op
ponent calculated to stir them to their
utmost exertion. The result was ap
parent last year. Now the republicans
are rallying, as it is easily possible for
them to do when they are not con
fronted by that determined opposition
that democrats will offer when their
art is Ina ehdministraltion only in osee
they are led by men who instnetsUveb f
,lpathise with them and think. they
are doing the highest possaible service to
the cause of humanity in leading them
where they wish to go. Under such 2
leadership the democratic party is at
all times irresistible, but it is idle to
expect that it will display the same e-]
thusiasm now that it did while en
gaged in the work of evicting Harrison
from the white house. Having in Mr.
Cleveland a president they can trust to
do his best for the country, and know
ing that, whether they understand him
or he understands them, they can rely
on him to do al in his power for the
welfare of the country, democrats are
going about their business, leaving the
affairs of government to the members
of the administration, and leaving the
republicans to do the shouting and per
spiring in politics.-St. Louis Republic
A SIGNIFICANT SHOWING.
Public Oplmlom Still in Favor of the Dem
ocratlo Party.
On the whole, the democrats have
done well in the spring elections. Chi
cago elected a democratic mayor in
spite of the formidable revolt in the
party against the nominee. In Cincin
nati and other Ohio towns the demo
crats divided the offices with their op
ponents, and got a fair share. In St.
Louis the republicans got all the offices
but one, and this is about the only via
tory of which they have a right to
boast. Rhode Island has given a dem
ocratic plurality for governor, and has
elected two democratic congressmen,
both of whom were in a minority at the
November election.
These results are all the more signifi
cant when we compare them with the
April elections four years ago. The re
publicans had then just succeeded in
displacing the democrats, who had had
control of the executive branch of the
federal government for four years. The
distribution of patronage was in active
progress then, as now, only repubicans
were taking the places of democrats,
instead of democrats succeeding repub
licans. The spring elections of 1889
showed a remarkable revolt against the
party that had just succeeded to power.
Chicago, which two years before had
elected a republican mayor by 20,000
majority, chose a democrat by 12,000.
Cincinnati, which had given Harrison a
big majority, divided the offices. St.
Louis went democratic, and a majority
of the town elections in Ohio, Indiana,
Illinois and Iowa showed democratic
gains. Rhode 1sland, which had given
Harrison 4,436 plurality in November,
1888, gave a democratic plurality of
4,419. It is true that the conditions of
suffrage had just been changed in that
state, and a number of new voters ad
mitted, but the republican vote, which
had been 10,768 in April, 1888, fell off
to 16,870 in April, 1889, while there was
a large increase in the democratic vote.
All these things, taken together,
were construed by democrats to mean
that the people were not well satisfied
with the new administration. The re
publican press tried to ridicule this in
terpretation, but mark what followed.
Ohio elected a democratic governor in
the November following. Indiana,
which went republican in 1888, has
been carried by the democrats every
year since. The same may be said of
Illinois. Iowa elected a democratic
governor in 1889, and reelected him in
1891. The symptoms of dissatisfaction
were, therefore, correctly interpreted
in the spring of 1889, by the democratic
press, inasmuch as subsequent events
fully supported what it then said.
The elections of this spring are sig
nificant to this extent, that they fail to
i show any marked change in public
opinion since the November election.
The democratic party retains the con
fidence of the masses of the people,
which is a good deal more than could
be truly said of the republican party
four years ago.-Louisville Courier
Journal.
