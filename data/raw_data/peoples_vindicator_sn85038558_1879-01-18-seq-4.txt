Lap In a valise and I started. Sev
alo the men accompanied me to
the lane of Mr. Levy's place and then
lefklae. This was between midnight
saI o'clock. After I had followed
th road a abshort distance I got fright
ened and took to the woods. I after

No complaint or charges have been
unadeagainst ae; Cunniughana's band
told me they had nothing against me
eacept my politics.
I was nominated for the legislature
by the Republicans against my own
isclinations io 1870.
I have never seen any inclination
e the part of the mass of the negroes
to act with the Demoerat!s.
There were not less than 250 men
belonging to the band which sur"
rounded my house; they belong to
the body nowas "s298."
The night before this a band of
muasked men came to my house; they
had eon black gowns, and it was im
possible to tell who they were; they
ld anet enter the house. They whoop
.d and yelled and said "Keep low or
we'll dill you." What Cunningham's
oap sold me was : His crowd would
idpse if Idid not leave the United
tats..as well as from the parish. On
may way down here I always told tihe
egree. to abstain from voting, as I
knew the "298" would discover it I
old the negroes anything but what
they instreucted me. The crowd stole
'verything in the way of arms in my
house. I own property, whico is
valaed at about $7000; I have been
compelled to leave it to take care of
itself.
The reason I surrendered without
iring was that may wife and dauglh ter
wersis the house, and if as.he haf

No force other than the United
