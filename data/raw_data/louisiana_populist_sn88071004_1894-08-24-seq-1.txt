public and private, and that with

means of distribution, direct to the
people, at a tax not exceeding 2 per
cent, be provided, as set forth in
the sub-treasury plan of tlhe Farm
ers) Alliance, or some better system
also by payments in discharge of
its obligations for plublic inmlprove
men ts.
a. We demand free and unlimit
ed coinage of silver liud gold at the
present legal ratio of 16 to 1.
b. Woe demand that the amount
of circulating medium be speedily
increased to not less than t +) I -er
capita.
c. We demand a graduated in
come tax.
d. We believe that the money
of the country should be kept as
amch as possible in the hands of
tihe people, and hence we wdemand
" that all State and national revenue
shall be limited to the necessary
expenses of the governmuent, eco
a' aomically and honestly administer
ed.
e. We demand that postal sav
ings banks be established by the
government for the safe deposit or
the earnings of the people and to
facilitate exchange.
2. Transportation being a means
of exchange and public necessity,
atghe government should own and
inrate the railroads it the inter
Sst of the lpople.
a. The telegraph and telephot:e,
likte the post office system, being a
necessity for the transportation of
news, should be owned and opera
ted by the government in the in

3. The land, including all the
S tional resources of wealth, is the
S ritage of all the people, and
~ - nhould not be monopolired for spec
alative purposes, and alien owner
ship of land sbonl'l be prohibited.
All land now held by railroads and
other corporations in excess of
eir actual needs, and all lands
now owned by aliens, should be re
claimed by the government and
held for actual settlers only.
Letthe People have the Truth.
The Democratic press is almost
Iunanimously inclined to agree up
on one fact, that is, that the pres
nt bnsiness depression is princi
ly due to the contraction of the
Sulating medium, but either with
intention to mislead, or for
at of better information, they
attempt to attribute it to the Re
publican party alone. We are in
alined to be liberal to our brethrl
of the quill driving persuasion, and
of ment,
bowa that the act of C
which lhad uch a terrible
destroying the circulatinl
lpassed the Semste by a

is avote were castd, and

Yeas 83, Nays 54. 28
v oted yea, and once nay. .
putblicans voted yea, and same
number voted nay. Had the Dem
ocrats been the friend to the peo
pie as now claimed for them, this
vote would have stood 82 against
a:rd .3 for, and this villainous leg
islation in favor of the bond holler
and against the interest of the
people would have been defeated.
But inste:d, only one lone Demo
crat in the Hlouse, and none in the
Senate had the manhood to stand
up for the rights of the people.
This is a recorded fact that cannot
be blotted out nor covered up, and
the I)emocrars are responsible for
the destruction of over one thou
sand nmillions of dollars of the peo
ple's money that bore no interest
but circulated freely as a medium
of exchange for labor and produce,
and instead thereof an issuance of
the same amount of United States
bonds bearing six a:nd seven per
cient interest in gold. These are
the facts as they exist, and the
I)emnowrati party can offer no e.t
cuse for its perfidy, and therefore
they try to keep the truth in the
back ground in order that the poo
ple may be mislead into the foolish
absurdity of again supporting a
party that has surrendered their
sacred rights to the money power
of the world. Now we have no
ipology to make for the Republi
can party, for a close investigation
into the facts fails to disclose any
dlittflerence in the two old parties.
The People's party is the only par
ty that offers to correct these evils
and restore this same class of non
interest bearing money to the peo
ple, and to abolish the National
banks of issue that control the
volume of money by issuing their
promisory notes at a high rate of in
terest to the people, these are the
immortal principles advocated by
Jackson and Jefferson. how our
liberality will not permit us to de
nonnce those who differ with us as
anarchists, cranks and fools, but
we do think it our right to ask all
to let their reason and judgment m
stead of their prejudices rule them.
Every laboring n. an, farmer,
merchant, lawyer, doctor, and all
others that do not make their mon
ey from venal legislation in favor
of despoilers, are interested in a
system of government that will
gve them a just reward for their
labor. This can only be had
through the success of the People's
party. Let us reason together and
give that party our united support.

WAStINciTON, August 8.-Rob
ert G. Still, as chief of the burean
of organization of the Democratic
Congressional committee, has is
sued an address to the Democrats
of color of the United States. The
address in part says: "The 14a
tional Negro Democratic League
will convene in Indianapblis, Ind.,
on the 14th inst. It is hoped that
negro Democrats from every State
and locality will be represented, to
evidence by their presence and
voice their loyalty to the policy and
prindples of the administration.
At no time in the history of negro
Democrats has there been greater
need for counselling together to
determine the future cause and
policy of the negro Democrat in
Amaerica. It is a matter of con
gratulation to note the loyalty
shown to tihe Democrat in Ala
bama in the recent election. Pos
sibly for the first time was the ne
gro vote directly appealed to and
emponse was evidenced by re
of large Democratic majorities

but at last the intelligent white
man has become determined to act
for himself, and finding that the
D)emocratic party is either unwil
ling or unable to carry into law
any of its plelges, they have de
cided to form their forces with the
I'eople's party-a new party whose
banner has never been besmijched
by deals with trusts, combines, cor
porations and money kings. The
D)emocratic party plainly recogni
zes this fact, and is now plealding
with the negro to save it. There
are many men that are honest in
their fears of negro domination,
and to those we we would ask the se
rious question-how can you follow
the Democratic party any further
after the acknowledgement that it
must look for its success in the fu
ture to the ignorance of this race
whom you so much fear t This is
a serious question, and it deserves !
your serious consideration. Why i
not act now, and helJp to build up
and carry to a success a party com
posed of the intelligent white ele
ment of the country !
If you want white supremacy
Join the I'opulists, if you want to
go into a party that acknowledges
its failure to even exist, without
uniting with the negro, then follow
the modern so-called l)emocracy.
Notice the language : "It is hoped
that negro Democrats from erery
8tate and locality wtill be represent
ed, to eridence by their presence and
roice, their loyalty to the policy and
principles of the administration."

the negro to crush white suprema

Too late Grover.
CAN'T WIN ON THEIR OWN
HAND.
Their Old Platform Worn Threadbare
-Wen't Stead Another Washing.
The Daily Picayune of the 16th
inst. says: "The ikifications that
tfree silver coinage is going to be
the chief issue in the November
Congressional eleeoions are con
stantly growing stronger. Both
Democrats and Republicans recog
nize that they have got to face it,
and in the West and, the South
both of the old parties are accept
ing and adopting it rather than
submit to the Populists." The evi
dent intention of the old parties is
to adopt some of the Populist plat
form planks for the purpose alone
of defeating the Populists not that
they intend to carry any of them
into force. This is more evident
from the fact that every Democrat
ic speaker in the last campaign as
serted and affirmed that the Nation
al Democratic platform contained
a plank that pledged the Democrat
ic party to free silver, it was so
recognized by the people and many
Congressmen. Yet such a bill was
absolutely voted down by the Dem
ocrats in Congress. Now a leading
Democratic organ tells us that the
Democrats will hare to adopt the
free ooinage of silver to defeat the
Populists. If they were not honest
in the last campaign have we any
assurance that they will be in this.
Tlake either horn of the dilemma, the
people whor are suffering from the
consequences can not alfford to wait
another two years and risk it. And
besides, the Democratic party will
never again have any better oppor
tunity to carry out pledges than
this time. The Democratic Con
gres has been in session for eleven
months, and the very papers that
advocate their retarn to Cougress
boldly tell us that they have been
controlled in the interest of the
trust, and against the interest of
the people. Aside from this evi
lence, we have tile platfourm adopt

Now we would like to know if
the pIeople have ever heard this
illatbortn spoken of or advocated
sinlce that election. It has been
buried. No doubt the people have
lorgotten it. Was it the duty of
that servant who pledged himself
to use his efforts to carry it into a
law; to keep it before Congress
until an issue was forced upon it,
or was it the duty of the people to
do so'
Now answer this question fairly,
ainll see if' you can determine what
the politicians mean when they tell
the farmer Ao keep out of polities.
They clearly lmean that they are
not going to do what they were
hired to do, and therefore it is bet
ter for the farmer not to know
what his servant, who is receiving
big wages, is doing. Now, who
hires Congressmen and other offi
cials The masses of the people.
Who pay them i The masses of the
people. Whose business is it then to
see that they discharge their duty f
The masses of the people. Then
it must certainly be a business
proposition on the part of the peo
ple, and we are morally certain that
the intelligent man of this country
would not retain a man in hiis eim
ploy after lie had absolutely refus
ed to do what lie was employed to
do, nor would hlie re.employ him af
ter lie had once deceived him. Now
if this is a fair proposition (and we
think it is) every laboring man in
this country must of necessity be
in politics in order to protect the
interests of his country, as the
interest of the National Govern
ment is a whole, made up of the
individual interest of each and
every person in the land, whether
he be great ortall, and the soon
er each individual recognizes this
tact, the better it will be for his
country. Now the effort to steal
planks out of the People's pa'ty
platform is only an evidence that
the-old parties recognize the fact
that the people have at last struck
the key note to the situation, and
unless the Populists can be defeat
ed, these measures will be carried
itto law. This they do not want,
and it is only to defeat those meas
uresat at they are so anxious to de
feat the Populists, and there is no
surer way of defeating reform
measures than to elect a so-called
Democrat on that platform. We
have already tried it and it is no
longer theory, but sad experience.
The Pullman Car Company has
decided to evict 3,000 people, resi

of the way things are Ieang carried on

'"Power had produced wealth and wealth
had produced corruption, The tribes of
Rome were bought and sold at the va

either of this faction or of that, divLided
among themselve, the places of trust and
honor and power, and did so with hands
ever open for the grasping of public
wealth. An honest man with clean
hands and a conscience, wilh scrnphls
and a love of country, became undttedi
for public employment. Cato in these
days was simply ridiculonus, and even
Cicero, though he was a trimmer, was
too honest for the times. Laws were
wrested from their purposes. and the
very Tribunes, [ofcers elected annually
to act on behalf of the people as checks

become the worst of tyrants. It was
