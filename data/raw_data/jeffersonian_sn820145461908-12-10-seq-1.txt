Summary of Ebents as They Happen
By Tom Dolan
In 1906 there were 30,613 children
dependent upon institutional charity
in New York City. In 1907 the num
ber had increased to 31,943. Enough
childish unfortunates in one State
alone to fill a good sized city.
The prohibition law of the new
State of Oklahoma has just been de
clared Constitutional by the Supreme
Court of that State.
Sereno E. Payne, the standpat
Chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee which is considering tar
iff schedules, has invited Andrew
Carnegie to come before the Commit
tee and express his ideas on revision.
This would be interesting, in view of
Mr. Carnegie’s recent alignment with
tariff reformers. Inasmuch as Mr.
Carnegie built up his overpowering
fortune by means of a protective tar
iff, and inasmuch as many of his so
called benefactions are to be main
tained by the income from steel bonds,
which income would fail if the tariff
for protection were removed, it is a
queer position for him to be in, but
an instructive one withal. It is as
though a well gorged hog should
leave the trough and advise its re
moval, certain that enough other pigs
will squeal against it to insure that
the old trough will remain.
“Dick” Croker, for many a long
and unsavory year the Democratic
“boss” of New York, and who has
more recently been resident of Eng
land and Ireland, is back in his old
haunts for a six months’ visit.
The South Dakota divorce laws
have been amended so as to require
applicants to have resided at least
one year in the State, and to present
their petitions only at the regular
terms of the Court.
On November 30 the government
applied to the Supreme Court for
a writ of certiorari in the famous
Standard Oil case, wherein the fine
of $29,000,000 was levied against the
corporation for the illegal practice of
rebating by Judge K. M. Landis,
whose decision was afterward re
versed by Judge Grosscup.
It is said that the coffee trade is
in a bad way, owing to the persist
ent advertising of its bad qualities
and the booming of its various riv
als. Here, then, is something dis
tinctly new. In this country there
are approximately 80,000,000 souls,
among whom the majority of those

who have reached the talking age
may any morning be heard confiding
that “they could not get through the
day without their coffee.” Is the
dread, then, to be lifted of that possi
ble day wherein nearly eighty mil
lions would lie prostrate without their
matutinal cup?
French scientists have succeeded in
making artificial sapphires that are
chemically identical with the natural
stones, and as beautiful in appear
ance.
An English Railway has provided
boxes of toys for the little passen
gers on its trains. American rail
ways are still busy furnishing all
their passengers with a need for nice,
artificial limbs.
After 36 years of blindness, Miss
Alice Hollis, of Port Huron, Michi
gan, has her sight restored through
the use of X-rays. This case holds
out hope that many another sufferer
may be saved from this worst of all
afflictions.
The Tennessee Copper Company has
recently completed the largest sul
phuric acid plant in the world and the
Ducktown Company is following this
with another large establishment, thus
utilizing the heretofore poisonous
fumes to vast industrial benefit. The
suit against the Ducktown companies
to force them to abate the fumes from
the copper works which were devas
tating large regions in Tennessee and
North Georgia has resulted in this
outcome. Germany has up to this
time been the home of the sulphuric
acid, perhaps the most indispensable
agent of civilization. There is almost
no branch of manufacture, art, or
science, which does not need sulphuric
acid and even farming is dependent
to a great extent upon artifiial fer
tilizers which require the use of this
wonderful acid. It is a veritable nec
romancer. By its use trash unspeak
able may be converted into glucose,
which, strange to say, is just as pure
and edible as though formed from the
nicest of sugar cane. So that the
manufacture of what was formerly
not only a waste, but a dangerous,
gas into an acid of enormous value,
means not only great profits to the
owners but should be of extreme ben
efit to the country which has been
forced to import so much of a for
eign product.
In no other smelters in America are
there such acid plants as those of the
Atlanta, Ga., Thursday, December 10, 1908
Tennessee companies. The enormous
cost of erection, in addition to the
difficulties to be overcome, prevented
development in this line until Geor
gia, by her suit, forced the research
experiments and heavy outlay re
quired. The state, in following the
suggestion of the supreme court, has
given time for experiments to war
rant the building of the plants and
opportunity for their erection.
Ignace Paderewsky, the world
famed Polish musician, has just given
out a rather remarkable interview
which touches upon the American im
migration question. As a foreigner,
from our standpoint, and as a man
of wide travel and culture, it is
strange that he should take the view
of so many of our own people that
they “should guard themselves
against this inrush of non-Anglo-
Saxon element. ’ ’ Continuing, he says
of Americans:
“They are spoiling their pure, rich,
Anglo-Saxon strain with a new vin
tage that comes from the waste prod
ucts of the old world. It is slowly
but gradually spoiling them. No great
or permanent harm has been done
yet, but it is beginning, and if they
go on like that, instead of progress
ing, their culture will retrogress and
in a few years they will find the pen
dulum has swung back to where they
were a hundred years ago. The An
glo-Saxon race is one of the finest

the world has ever seen, and the more
they dilute it the worse it will be
come. It is the only race that is dis
tinctively developed. You see this in
traveling from the Continent of
Europe to England. It is only on
reaching the island that you find in
dividuality. Before, on the Conti
nent, all the nations were more or less
alike to you. Some had dirtier hands
and dirtier clothes than others, and
there their individuality stopped. Not
so with the Anglo-Saxons. They are
a magnificent race.”

It is stated that the common squill,
or Sea-onion, a plant heretofore con
sidered entirely harmless to all things,
is a fatal poison to rats. Mixed with
ordinary food and distributed where
rodents are a nuisance, it will quick

will also help to solve the problem of
dealing with certain Asiatic diseases
which are conveyed principally by
rats.
