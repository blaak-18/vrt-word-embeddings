FORMER MEMRER
MAKES CHARGES
AGAINST KLAN
Dorr Says He Joined When
Mind Was “Immature,”
Three Years Ago
NOT AWARE OF AIMS
Makes Baseless Allegations As
to Aims and Purposes of
American Movement
DES MOINES, IA.. Feb. 20-
“Never let patriotism interfere with
basiness,” seems to be the tone of a
letter received by the Des Moines
headquarters of the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan from a local business
man, withdrawing his membership
from the organisation.
It is quite evident that during the
time the gentleman in question was
affiliated with the organization he
failed utterly to understand the aims
and purposes of the Klan. He says,
“to an immature mind, such as mine
was at the time I was initiated three
years ago . . " I thought the or
ganization could accomplish good.
Probably it was because his mind
was immature, that he failed to see
the real purpose of the Klan.
In the communication the charge
la made that “unscrupulous persons”
take the law into their own hands in
the name of the Klan. Newman Dorr,
for he is the author of the communi
cation, can not bring forth one proof
that the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan, as an organization, or any of
its members, ever assumed the au
thority of the law and carried it into
execution.
Took Law-Order Oath
The Klan is forever back of the
duly constituted authorities of the
community in which it exists. Three
years ago, Mr. Dorr took an oath to
uphold them in the execution of
their duty. And unless Mr. Dorr has
himself taken the law into his own
hands, there has been no such at
tempt in the name of the Klan, for
no true Klansman ever has done
such.
Neither has the Klan at any time
placed a “slur of un-American” on
Catholics and Jews. The Klan's en
emies have endeavored, time and
again ,to make the organization ap-
Sear as an anti-Catholic and anti
ewish order. This, because it re
serves unto itself the right to select
its own membership.
Were there chaos throughout the
land, says Mr. Dorr, there might be
a need for such an organization as
the Klan. He does not seem to real
ize that there is “mental chaos” ram
pant in the nation. And that is the
next thing to physical chaos. The
Klan is a movement of patriotic, na
tive-born Americans, who seek to
prevent a condition in this nation as
recently came to pass in Italy, for
instance. It seeks to do this solely
through legal, constitutional chan
nels. If the United States was in a
condition similar to that of Italy a
few years ago, the Klan might be a
violent order and take the law into
its own hands as did the T acisti, and
as Mr. Dorr falsely claims it now is.
as Mr. Dorr falsely claims it now is
and does.
Failed to Get Vision
But the author of the letter has
failed to get the vision of his native
land today. He has failed to see
what there is in store for the future
of America. “There is no failure,
but failure to serve the purpose,
says The lowa Fiery Cross slogan.
And that purpose is restoring the
United States to the plane where its
founders hoped to have it, and from
which it has, in recent years, fallen
away.
The full text of the letter is as
follow's:

Associated with
H. E. Rumsey, General Agent
Penn Mutual Life
Dear Mr , , .
From the letter I received from
you the other day, I take it, that in
spite of never having paid any dues
to the organization, I am still consid
ered as having some sort of member
ship in the Ku Klux Klan.
“I am writing this to inform who
ever it may concern that I do not
feel that I have any connection what
ever with the organization, and that
I regret exceedingly that I ever had.
“To an immature mind, such as
mine was at the time I was initiated
three years ago, it would seem from
the high sounding expressions of pur
pose that your society could accom
plish a great deal of good. And I
have no doubt that in certain chan
ties, and in causing the rank and file
to wake up and think, you have done
some good.
“But a maturer mind contemplates
the very serious evils that are apt to
result from the activities of your so-
“Unscrupulous persons taking the
* law into their own hands in imita
tion, class and creed hatred, and dis
agreement of the processes of our
constituted government. Further
more, a mature mind resents the des
picable slur of un-American thrown
upon thousands and thousands of up
right, law-abiding, thoroughly patri
otic Catholics and Jews who have
helped make our country fit to live
in
“Were our States face to face with
chaos, such an organization as yours
might be the last hope and worth
trying, hut until that time comes
there is no room in America for the
Ku Klux Klan.

POCAHONTAS, VA.—Klansmen in
full regalia recently visited all the
Sunday schools of different denomi
nations in the surrounding territory
and presented each school with a $lO

New Senator Voted
For Hawkeye Solon
SENATOR BRUCE
William Cabell Bruce quickly be
came one of the most talked-of men
in the Sixty-eighth congress, and no
wonder. For he is a Democrat and
he voted for Senator Albert B. Cum
mins, Republican, of lowa, for chair
man of the interstate commerce com
mittee. He unqualifiedly indorsed
Secretary Mellon’s tax program. He
as unqualifiedly put himself on rec
ord against the bonus.
Within a week of his entrance this
junior senator from Maryland had im
pressed upon Washington the fact
that he is a new type of public offi
cial—the kind the radicals anathema
tize and the rock-bound regulars
fight shy of.
RELIGIOUS RALLY IS
HELD AT DUBLIN, GA.
Grand Dragon Assured of Sup
port in Spreading
Klankraft
DUBLIN, GA., Feb. 19.—The first
of a series of religious ceremonials
to be held over the state under the
auspices of realm headquarters, was
observed here Sunday afternoon when
the Laurens county court house was
filled to overflowing with Klansmen
and their friends of Dublin.
The meeting, which, was purely a
devotional one, was open to the pub
lic and was honored by the presence
of the Protestant ministry of the
city, who occupied seats on the ros
trum with the Grand Dragon and his
staff. Many aliens were present,
among whom were several score of
colored people, who occupied seats
in the balcony throughout the serv
ices and blended their voices with
those of the Klansmen in singing
“America," “Onward Christian Sol
diers,” and other patriotic and re
ligious songs.
Many state and county officials par
ticipated in the meeting, at the close
of which the Grand Dragon was as
sured of the support of the better
element of the state in his undertak
ing to carry the gospel of Klankraft
to the people of Georgia.
GOOD CITIZENSHIP
FOSTERED BY K. OF P.
Newton, lowa, Chapter Offers
Prizes to Junior High
Students
NEWTON, I A., Feb. 20—Delta
Lodge, Knights of Pythias, has offered
three prizes to members of the junior
class in the Newton high school who
will write the best papers on Ameri
can citizenship. Their papers will be
based on work taken in civics during
the second semester of the year, and
the prizes will be awarded at com
mencement time.
The Pythians are very desirous that
every member of the junior class
studying civics participate in the
event, for the lodge officers and mem
bers want to aid in impressing on stu
dents the responsibilities of good cit
izenship.
The plan on which the Newton
Knights are working was suggested
by the Grand Lodge of lowa, and has
been adopted by 25 different lodges
of the order within the state.
MARION, ILL.—Rev. Charles D.
McGhee, grand titan of the Ku Klux
Klan in Illinois, was the principal
speaker at the First Baptist church
here January 24. The meeting was
open to the public and was given for
the purpose of disseminating true in
formation regarding the purposes and
practices of the Ku Klux Klan.
ACTIVITIES OF WOMEN OF KLAN
GROWING THROUGHOUT IOWA
ftty ONLOOKER)
The Women of the Ku Klux Klan
are spreading throughout the state of
lowa.
In city, town, and hamlet and coun
tryside, the native-born, Protestant
American women are coming to the
standard of the unfurled stars and
stripes and the uplifted fiery cross.
Reports reaching the head of the
women’s organization in bes Moines,
are to the effect that great stri> es
in membership and upbuilding of or
ganization work are going on.
In the capital city, Albia. Perry
and Marshalltown, especially, are
large numbers of new cam.idates be
ing initiated. Next week, the bes
.mines women will naturalize one of
the largest classes that has been held
for many weeks.
AMERICAN HOMES
AT CROSS ROADS,
DECLARES EDITOR
DES MOINES, IA,. Feb. 18
“The American home is at the
cross roads,” declared P. J. C}rn, edi
tor of The Call of The North, the
Ku Klux Klan newspaper for Minne
sota, in an address on “The Ameri
can Home" at the Capitol Hill
Church of Christ, Des Moines, Sun
day evening.
“The home is the basis of all civ
ilization. Upon it our nation stands or
falls,” declared the speaker. “The
American home today is not all that
it should be. Divorce figures are
piling up too rapidly; there is not
enough love in the home.
“Love is the basis of the home;
without it, the home is not com
plete. There must be the right co
operation between all members of
tne home. Today that seems to be
lacking, with parents following many
outside attractions and putting the
children to one side as of secondary
importance.
Bible at Table
“Today the Bible is not found on
the libarary table. People seem to
be afraid of being called religious.
In my home our mother read the Bi
ble and prayed every morning at
breakfast. Although that little ser
vice at the time seemed tedious and
unnecessary, it has been of the
greatest benefit through life."
Mr. Orn related that on visiting
the Minnesota State penitentiary at
Stillwater, he found the Bible much
in evidence. Upon asking a guard
if the Good Book helped in the work
at the penitentiary, he was assured
that it greatly did so. “But in Min
nesota, it is against the law to read
the Bible in the public schools,” he
continued. “In some parts of the
state where school teachers have
read it, it has been ordered out.
What is good enough for the crim
inals of Minnesota, is good enough
for the school children of that
state!" the speaker emphasized.
Need Old-Time Homes
“We need old-fashioned homes,
where the Bible is read and taught
to the children. The parents can
turn to the old Book to find that
which they need to make them the
right kind of parents; which will en
able them to carry out their duties
of parenthood, as they should be
carried out.”
That the father of the home should
not be a dignified aristocrat, but a
pal and a companion to his boys and
girls, was pointed out by Mr. Orn,
who is the father of two boys and a
girl. Many a child’s life has been
ruined because of the wrong atti
tude of the father. The parents should
teach their children the right atti
tude toward the sexes. Only in that
way can the proper foundation for
future homes be laid. “I have seen
thousands of wrecked boys and girls
whose parents are solely to blame
for their children, because they did
not teach them the proper things
at the proper time,” declared Mr.
Orn.
“The solution to the problem, is
for the parents to turn to the Master
for their inspiration and guide, to
turn to the Bible, for it contains
things for all clean tastes.”
The service w r as conducted by Rev.
Thomas S. Humprey, supplying for
Rev. N. C. Carpenter.
Bolsheviks Turn
Patriotic Under
Klan “Influence”
PITTSBURGH, PA., Feb. 9.—One
more example of the influence for
good the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan are exerting was enacted here
last Sunday when a group of Klans
men, scattered throughout an audi
ence that was listening to a bombas
tic speech on the merits of Nicolai
Lenin, he of Bolshevistic fame, in
the Lyceum theater, arose to their
feet at the height of the tirade on
American principles, and induced all
present to bow their heads in silent
tribute to the memory of Woodrow
Wilson.
Following this constructive action,
the Klansmen, aided, it is believed,
by members of the American Legion
that were present began singing.
“America.” Further alleged “red”
activity was impossible and the
meeting adjourned shortly thereaf
ter. .
Not a trace of riotous action mark
ed the stand taken by the patriotic
men present, and, although Pitts
urgh newspapers carried the story
next morning, it was not generally
known, nor published, that Klans
men were responsible for the placing
of an American touch to what would
have otherwise been a radical un-
American meeting.
Charity work is being carried on
by the women. In Des Moines and
many other cities, the memoers mbet
through the week, on some day other
than their regular scheduled meet
ing day, and sew. Quilts, clothing,
and other necessary articles of living
are prepared.
All women’s organizations have
their committees to visit poor and
needy families, and report to the
general body. Material assistance is
given, either by distribution or by
money donations.
At the last meeting of the Des
Moines ivlanswomen Thursday night,
the ivleagle of the Des Moines Klans
men spoke. He talked on the neces
sity of secrecy in the activities of
the order and of the practice of
odanishness.
THE FIERY CROSS
POLITICIANS SEEK ONLY OWN
SUCCESS, NOT COMMON GOOD
Continued from page 2
as that there was a six per cent Il
literacy In America. The army tests
revealed that 54.9 per cent of the
drafted men were “unable to read
and understand newspapers, and write
letters home In the English lan
guage.”
Remember that a majority of these
young men were less than a decade
removed from their educational days
This evidence is of failure, not re
mote, but almost immediately relat
ed to the civilization-destroying in
adequacies of the present public
school system.
Today, in the United States, there
is thirty times as much absolute il
literacy as in Germany and Denmark;
there is twelve times as much illit
eracy here as in Switzerland; six
times as much as in Norway and
Sweden, more than three times as
much as in England, Scotland and
Wales.
At the present rate of diminish
ment, it would take eighty-four years
to eliminate illiteracy in this coun
try, taking absolute illiteracy fig
ures, instead of the more depressing
army tests. If we accept the latter
as a basis, fully five hundred years
would elapse before illiteracy were
stamped out of our national life.
In the face of such facts, I main
tain that no citizen can oppose demo
cratic education in America unless
he be an un-American enemy of our
institutions.
There are in this country approxi
mately 25,000.000 boys and girls of
school age. Were those of university
years to be included, the number
would reach above 33,000,000. In
1920, according to census statistics,
we had 25.042,637 children between
the ages of seven and seventeen. The
grade and high schools, then, should
be providing the best of educational
opportunities for at least that num
ber.
In 1920, 4,405,437, a total of nine
teen per cent of our children between
the ages of seven and seventeen,
were not attending any school.
Between the ages of seven and thir
teen, no less than 9.4 per cent were
not attending any school.
At the ages of 14 and 15, 20.1 per
cent were not in school.
Among those 16 and 17, 57.1 per
cent were not in any school.
The teachers in the public schools
of America number 555,586. Fifty
four per cent of them have not had
normal school training. In the ru
ral schools, 23 per cent of these
teachers have had less than two years
of education above the elementary
grades. Thousands have had no train
ing beyond the eighth grade.
The Hierarchy Opposing Democratic
Education
It is apparent, then, that from ev
ery point of view, except that .of
selfishness, the educational doctrine
of Horace Mann should be written
into the laws and into the life of
this nation. Patriotism demands it,
common sense sanctions it, every
consideration of individual and na
tional welfare pleads its necessity.
Why, then, has this fundamental
program not been adopted.
It Is because of the opposition of
one of the oldest and most powerful
special Interests in the world today.
The hierarchy of the Roman Cath
olic church stands against America
on this issue, the public school, in its
every phase, aspect and result is re
pugnant to the Pope and all his
priesthood. After a most thorough
and unbiased examination of the
forces for and against this program,
I can say to you with absolute cer
tainty that excepting only civic self
ishness, the Roman Catholic Hierar
chy is the one Influence that Is suc
cessfully obstructing adequate pub
lic school education In America. It
is pursuing that course because the
hierarchy that has both its govern
mental and religious headquarters at
Rome is now, always has been, and
perhaps always will be, opposed to
the public sponsorship of institutions
of learning. From its point of view,
education is a prerogative of the
church. It refuses to accept secular
control or to countenance any re
sult that can or may subordinate the
recrultlTe objects of parochialism.
Therefore, through its political pow
er, this alien hierarchy says to Amer
ica, “You shall not establish an edu
cational system that sets up in that
field an exclusive authority higher
than that of the church; public
schools shall not be legalized into a
standing superior to those of the
church.”
The hierarchy does not openly, hon
estly and frankly define either its op
position or the objects of that oppo
sition. Instead it resorts to camou
flage. What it really says to you is
that our educational program for
America would be unconstitutional;
that national aid to public schools
would violate states’ rights; that such
a system as we propose would be at
tended by bureaucratic and politi
cal perversions. What the spokesmen
of the Vatican in America really
mean is that the further advance
ment of democratic education with
in this republic would be an insur
mountable impediment to the papal
dream of world-wide temporal do
minion.
It is not possible to find a single
intelligent citizen, whatever his or
her preferences, who does not un
derstand that the hierarchy is unal
terably opposing democratic educa
tion in America. Therefore, in order
more clearly to comprehend the
causes and effects of that opposition,
it will be well at this point squarely
to face the fundamental differences
between Catholicism and Protestant
ism.
The Vatican for Church and State
The hierarchy believes in the clos
est connection between church and
state. We demand, in the name and
in the interest of democracy, that
they be completely separated.
Throughout the centuries this atti
tude of the Vatican has never
changed. It never will. With the
hierarchy, and all its priesthood, al
ways the church is the primary con
sideration. Even today in America,
a hundred and thirty-five years after
the adoption of our constitution had
made it the basic law of the land
that government should not interfere
with religion, nor religion with gov
ernment, neither in the pulpit nor
in the press of Catholicism do you
ever find country mentioned apart
from the church. It is always “churcf,
and country,” with the “church” com
ing first. That is their idea, not to
have the church auxiliarate the
state, but to have civil authority and
political power serve the church. I
do not criticise those who adhere to
that doctrine. I only state the truth
as it is, in the conviction, as hrinh
founded as their opposing belief can
possibly be, that no religious organi
zation can even seek, much leOs at
tain, temporal character without ir
reparable injury both to church am
state.
Church Control of Education
Throughout the domain of educa
tion, it is the theory of the hier
archy, as it is their practice, t«
teach what to think. We desire that
the young be taught how to think
that they may be encouraged to
delve deeper and deeper into all the
hidden mines of information, in the
hope and assurance that the result
will be an ever-increasing output of
helpful human and divine attain
ments; that it will bring, at least
within the range of possibility, a har
monizing of humanity upon the rock
of eternal truth; that finally “peace
on earth, good will to men” may be
come a glorious reality, to atone foi
the long darkness of misery and
strife.
Not even in matters of religion
does the hierarchy encourage its sub
jects, either innocent children, or hab
ituated adults, to exercise real inde
pendence of thought or action. Bi
ble-reading by the laity is discour
aged. I have here a flippant and
rather offensive reference to this tra
ditional attitude, by the Catholic
News, as follows:
“We Catholics have no apolo
gies to make for our church’s op
position to private interpreta
tion of the Bible. Every Tom,
Dick and Harry isn’t allowed by
the United States government to
interpret the Constitution as he
sees nt. The U. S. Supreme Court
says the Constitution means thus
and so. But r.o minister de
nounces Uncle Sam because of
that fact. And the Constitution
of the United States is much eas
ier for the ordinary mortal to in
terpret than the Bible. If Prot
estantism had a supreme court,
there wouldn’t be so many vari
eties of religion among the breth
ren.
Catholics regard education as the
prerogative of their religion. We be
lieve that the agencies and objects
of education should be publicly spon
sored and controlled; that the train
ing of the young is the first duty,
the most fundamental function of
the state.
Here in another statement of it:
“The Catholic church towers
above the ages, above nations,
above men, mistress of all the
forces of education morality.”
Those are the words of Clare Ger
ald Fenerty, from an address before
the Knights of Columbus Dining
Club at Philadelphia, as quoted in
the Catholic Standard and Times.
But there is something far beyond
the ethical and moral in the Catho
lic attitude. Just as the hierarchy
3eeks political influence in order that
more recognition and greater bene
fits may accrue to the church, so
does it have no identical motive in
demanding church-controlled educa
tion. Here it is, as given expression
in the magazine called Ave Marla:
“Every Catholic school today
means a dozen flourishing par
ishes thirty years from today.”
The Hierarchy, as a religious or
ganization, demands the temporal
right to dominate education, high
and low, because that control would
facilitate the spread and acceptance
of its own sovereignty in every coun
try affected and finally throughout
the world.
The assertion of that attitude is
tempered only by the measure of its
E resent power to enforce it. The
ierarchy in America today does not
make an open stand against all non
religious instruction because it does
not at this time dare to go to battle
on that issue. What the hierarchy’
does seek to accomplish, through
camouflage, is the prevention of any
further advancement of public school
education and of any curtailment of
the privileges of parochialism. With
the first opportunity, having recruit
ed the necessary prestige and power,
the Catholic hierarchy of this coun
try would dethrone democratic edu
cation entirely. They would do that
here, as certainly as the process is
now going on in church-and-state
countries, because the Vatican desires
it, and to them all that is good and
holy is inseparably associated with
papal desires and decrees.
Hie Monarchist Idea
There is another fundamental dif
ference, the most basic of all. Catho
licism is built and maintains itself,
in all its temporal and religious ra
mifications, upon the monarchical
idea of the individual as subject in
stead of citizen. The doctrine of de
mocracy in its every relation to hu
manity is exactly the reverse. It ex
alts the individual, clothing him
and her with all the attributes of
sovereignty, culminating in civiliza
tion’s greatest glory and most mng
nificant triumph, her only final, un
failing safeguard, “the consent of
the governed” in all that pertains
to public affairs. Every theory, ev
ery condition, every hope of demo
cracy centers in the development of
the individual, the sum total of
which shall be social strength, intel
ligence and morality,
Here is the issue. Public school
education is democratic education.
The fight against that system is be
ing waged bv and for Catholic par
ochialism, which is the essence of
monarchy.
Fundamental American Principles
On Trial
How is it possible for any paro
chial power to obstruct public
schools in America? The answer goes
deep—to the very vitals of our insti
tutions. The truth, terrible and ter
rifying, is that our institutions have
not yet been solidly and lastingly
established. The basic principles of
Americanism are yet on trial. The
failure to provide, adequately and
democratically for public school edu
cation lies so much in the strength
of the opposition as In our own na
tional weakness.
God knows that the cause of edu
cation, standing alone, is sufficient
to justify a life and death struggle
with the hierarchical elements anta
gonizing its attainment; but thi?
controversy involves other fundamen
tals; our triumph over parochialism
and propoganda must Include other
and eTen more foundational van
qnfshments.
In the present crisis we ara con
fronted by conditions rather thar
theories. Theoretically, at the very
beginning, this nation safeguarde
its institutions through the separa
tion of church and state. Actually
that was never acompllshed.
The pioneers who made America
had before them the tragic conse
quences of church control of govern
ment. They, at least their immedi
ate ancestors, knew from personal
experience the perils and persecu
tions of religious controversy. They
saw clearly the faithful truth that
religious warfare was always the
culminating result whenever and
wherever a powerful church left the
spiritual field and entered the gov
ernmental. They knew that every
temporal invasion by a religious or
ganization had invariably left a
blood-stained trail of selfishness,
cruelty and oppression.
Therefore, in founding this Repub
lic, they intended that there should
not be then or ever, any religious
interference with the government,
nor any governmental interference
with religion. Somehow, the em
hasis came to be placed upon the
second, leaving the first more a mat
ter of implication. The Constitu
tion provides for the utmost religious
freedom, which was wise and just;
it did not, however, in specific, iron
clad language, guard against reli
gious license in the field of govern
ment. It was no more and, no less,
the intention to do one than the
other; but the fact remains that the
basic law was left too open, too
much subject to abuse, witn respect
to churchly encroachments upon sov
ereignty. For generations, little
harm resulted. Now, suddenly, after
half a century of unperceived growth,
the un-American power that develop
ed out of the one-sided freedom has
arisen to curse and confound our ef
forts in behalf of democratic educa
tion.
In other words, we hare not yet
brought about the separation of the
church and state in this country. If
you want proof, undisputable, unim
peachable proof, it exists in the fact
that today, there is a parochial pow
er than can and does say to the elec
tors and legislators of America:
“Thus far shall you go, and no farth
er on this issue of education. Propa
ganda and propagation through the
schools, are prerogatives of Pope and
priesthood. Public welfare is subor
dinate to the temporal interests of
the hierarchy.”
I say to you then —I say to all
America— that the winning of this
fight for democratic education in

volves more than the immediate re
sult of such a victory. Standing be
tween us and that achievement is
the reactionary, repulsive principle
of church and state, the civilization
destroying, war-engendering power
of church over state. The very idea,
and every influence of that align
ment must be broken and buried
beyond resurrection. In and around,
above and below, this question is the
Vatican attitude of super-human,
super-national sovereignty. Tb that
extent the cause of democratic edu
cation is inseparably linked with the
issue of church and state. Both bat
tles must be fought, and won, to
gether. Otherwise all our efforts for
an adequate public school system
will be transient and futile.
The only soil in which free schools
ran flourish Is that of a strictly
