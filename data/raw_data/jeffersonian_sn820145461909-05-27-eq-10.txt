The Andrew Carnegie Society be
stows medals for bravery in rescuing
life. It seems to me t'hat no matter
what the conditions may be, or the
place where hum'an beings are suffer
ing, Hie same effort should be made to
restore lives, and especially is this
true of the unfortunates of insane
asylums. However, it is true that this
class is particularly neglected. A life
can be saved on land as well as at
sea; why should not this be done, and
as much credit given as though we
risked the raging billows of the
ocean ?
I have witnessed many a young wo
man. likewise men go down in de
spair and become complete wrecks
mentally and physically by improper
management in Hie istitivtion, —undis-
covered legions within the heart of
civilization are let die through wilful
egligence and in’huiman treatment,
•s [ write this document, January
3, 1909, this state of affairs exists.
'I seems incredible to believe, but so
cip me God, it is true, absolutely.
The polished manner of officials in
meeting visitors would make the aver
age man or woman believe that the
sylumris conducted on splendid dis
ci- line—nothing lacking for the eom
“ort of its inmates. They admit
visitors to a few of the best halls—
principally women’s wards, and the
19th Hall Male building. But seldom
Io they admit them to visit the tor
tures of hell that reign in the Twin
’’uildings. This is the place where
the principal slaughtering of hu
manity is done. T 'have witnessed
patients being knocked down without
cause.
One morning as I stood up to get
’ mop, or rub, which is used on the
floors, —furnishing daily exercise for
t'he patients,— an inmate by the name
of Thompson failed to take his rub.
The 'attendant immediately knocked
his feet from under him, and the un
fortunate’s face hit the floor, face
foremost, and the blood gushed from it
like water thrown from a pail. The
attendant stood him up again, and
Thompson hadn’t time to reach for
'his rub before the attendant knocked
him down again. This time his feet
were kicked from the rear to the
front and the patient fell with fear
ful fence, striking on the back of his
head. I spoke up, saying that the
man would be killed, and in reply was
told that 1 would get some of the
same treatment if I didn’t stop talk
iii'r. That same day, Thompson was
amble to be at his meals, and was
confined on the same hall with me for
over a week. His skull was injured by
the severe blows which he got from
being thrown to the floor. After
wards he was removed to the sick
ward, where 1 heard he 'had died.
Now this is only one instance where
the real cause of a patient’s death
was hidden, and another cause
assigned for his demise.
At this writing, I had much cause
to make known existing laxity and
abuse, but knowing how useless it
would be, and that it would probably
make my stay prolonged, I concluded
to keep silent. I have witnessed
enough crimes perpetrated on the poor
unifortunates to make any strong man
'leffersonlan
or woman have cold chills thrill 'their
system. I, myself, have been worked
up to such nervous tension that it
produced neuralgia of the heart, and
these attacks were brought about by
being compelled to put up with and
see inhuman treatment, which I re
sisted many times, but when I re
ported to the managing officials, no
action was taken and things con
tinued on the same plane.
A patient is transferred from one
ha’ll to another when he makes com
plaint. The employees at a lunatic
asylum are seldom discharged and if
they should be, in a few weeks they
are taken back. 1 could never
believe such outrages existed, and
horrid punishment was perpetrated
flfpon unfortunates, until I witnessed
it myself and tasted its bitterness.
Scoundrels of the blackest nature of
humanity are employed at Georgia
Insane Asylum; the most ingenious
and resourceful of inventive minds
could not distance or improve the
methods of concealing the fraud and
deception that the managing power
of the Asylum exhibits in hiding the
true state of aftiairs. Conditions as
they exist are disguised in malignant
form. Trustees are primed down
with several coats of prudential oil
of falsehood. This honorable body
of distinguished and selected men,
eespecially chosen for looking after
the institution’s inmates never ap
proach any of them and ask as to their
treatment. This is straight goods.
How is it possible to find out any
wrong acts unless they enquire from
those who are capable of giving in
formation ? Employees will not in
form upon one another, but conceal,
and the physicians 'believe them
always in preference to inmates.
There is no chance to assist yourself.
Every effort is made to prevent let
ters from reaching the outside unless
they are passed through the office.
This rule has existed during my clos
ing seven years —in hell alive. If 1
had been able to inform my family
of the severe hardships 1 suffered and
the excruciating strain but forcibly
upon me, without cause, I know they
would have made arrangements
for my leaving. 1 have borne
my severe tortures in silence
with the hope of letting the
public know later. 1 never dreamt of
witnessing such deception in my
life as I have seen made use of by
officials.
On December 26, 1908, Saturday,
two ladies from Savannah, called at
( enter Building - office to enquire
about and see me. They informed me
when I met them afterwards, that
an official, who is employed by the
State, told them that he didn’t know
of my whereabouts. Afterwards, I
was shown the official who made this
assertion, and he knew me well. I
told my 'lady friends that this was a
common occurrence, as officials de
prive .many people of the pleasure of
seeing their friends by such false
pretences as these. Christmas day
they asked for me and got no infor
mation, but these ladies had deter
mined to see me, only for this they
would never have succeeded.
It would undoubtedly be true that
more patients would be taken a wav
from the sanitarium jf people
