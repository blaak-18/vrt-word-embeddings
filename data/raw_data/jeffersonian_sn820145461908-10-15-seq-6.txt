“Marionl Marion Lindsay, hurry!
The barge will start in five minutes! ’ ’
Ethel Saunders darted into the
Lindsays’ cottage, carefully hugging
a basket which contained sandwiches,
cake, cookies, bananas, and, in fact,
everything necessary for a delicious
luncheon.
“Mar”—
Ethel stopped at the foot of the
stairs, the -word broken off short in
her throat by the sight of Marion
coming down in the dark-blue cotton
frock and the big apron which she al
ways wore when helping her mother
with the housework.
“Why, Marion Lindsay, you’re not
dressed!” she gasped. “Oh, hurry,
or we’ll be late!”
“I’m not going, Ethel.”
“Not going? Not going to the Sun
day school picnic?” Ethel could
hardly believe her ears.
Not going? Marion’s lips quivered
a little in spite of all she could do to
keep them steady. “Mamma has one
of her headaches. She can hardly lift
her head from the pillow. And baby
cried nearly all night. I suppose it
was the heat And Willie’s tooth
ache is w’orse; his face is all swollen
this morning.”
Ethel’s eyes widened in dismay at
this list of woes. “I’ll stay—at home
with you —if you like,” she brought
out with brave self-sacrifice.
“Indeed you won’t!” Marion al
most pushed her outside the door for
fear she would seriously think of such
a thing. “You can tell me all about
it afterward,” she called out cheer
fully as her friend, with a very dis
appointed face, hurried away.
But when Ethel was out of sight
Marion ran to the back of the house
and, sinking down under shelter of a
dense vine on the back piazza, shed
some very sorrowful tears into her
apron. For weeks and weeks she had
looked forward to the Sunday school
picnic. Inside, on the kitchen table,
were the hard-boiled eggs for sand
wiches, the cake, and bananas, all
ready for the luncheon she was to
have taken, and now —
A faint moan coming through th®
open window from where poor little
six-year-old Willie sat nursing his
swollen face reached her.
“I ought to be ashamed, crying
here when I’m not in pain,” Marion
thought as she rose quickly and hur
ried into the kitchen to wash away the
traces of tears.
It took only a moment to fill the
hot water bottle and get Willie to lie
down on the couch in the sitting room
with the soothing heat against his
face. Then she stole up to her moth
er’s room. Mrs. Lindsay was trying
to sit up in bed, one hand supporting
her aching head.
“Oh, Marion, dear,” she said
feebly, “I don’t know what to do
about Miss Dean’s shirt waist! She’s
to call for it at eleven, and it isn’t
finished.”
Mrs. Lindsay had been a dress
maker before her marriage, and since
her husband’s death, a year ago, had
taken up her old occupation in order
tp support herself and children.

“What has to be done to it, mam>
ma?” Marion asked.
“Only to be hemmed up around the
bottom. Maybe I could do it if” —
Mrs. Lindsay pressed one hand to
her temples, which the effort of speech
had set throbbing afresh.
“Indeed you won’t do anything of
the kind! ’ ’ Marion laid her mother
gently back on the pillow, smoothing
the hair away from her forehead with
soft, cool fingers. “You know I can
hem very neatly, mamma, for you
taught me yourself; and if I take
plenty of time and very small stitches,
I’m sure I can do it all right.”
Mrs. Lindsay’s lip quivered as she
put up one hand and held that of her
thirteen-year-old daughter against her
cheek. 11 Mother’s blessing, ’ ’ she said
softly.
Having seen that the baby was
sleeping quietly after her wakeful
night, Marion closed her mother’s
door and stole downstairs. Tying on
a very clean apron, she brought Miss
Dean’s waist and her mother’s basket
from a closet, and sat down to work.
It took her over an hour to finish the
waist, she was so careful to take short
stitches. Then she folded it up care
fully, all ready for Miss Dean when
she called.
There "were several other customers
to be seen during the forenoon, and
this, with the housework, kept her
busy until dinner time. When she
had dressed the baby and brought the
little thirteen-months-old girl down
stairs looking very sweet and pretty
and changed her own frock, she began
to feel very tired. But just then there
■was a sound of wheels, and who
should drive into the yard but Grand
ma and Grandpa Davis?
Now, Grandpa Davis usually drove
in from the farm about onee a week,
bringing butter, vegetables and fruit
to his daughter and her three chil
dren; but grandma did not come so
often, and when she did it was always
cause for great rejoicing. So Marion
called out delightedly: “Here are
grandpa and grandma!” And Wil
lie, whose face was too swollen to
admit of calling anything, ran out to
show grandma how bad it was and
get all the sympathy he could; while
the baby pounded the sides of her
carriage, crying, “G’an’ma!” at the
top of her feeble voice.
Mrs. Lindsay, who had had a long
nap—the only thing which did her
any good when she had one of these
attacks—came downstairs feeling bet
ter; and they all sat out on the back
piazza, where it was cool and shady.
Grandma cuddled poor little Willie up
in her comfortable lap, where he cried
a little more —but not “painy” tears
now, as he told her, for the tooth
ache was better.
“You come along with me, Mar
ion,” grandpa said, leading the way
to the wagon with many mysterious
nods and winks. There, amongst oth
er things, he gave into her keeping a
basket covered with a clean, white
towel. Beckoning her around to the
other side of the cart, away from the
house, grandpa lifted one corner of
the covering and displayed a largo
sponge cahe, beautifully broxyn and
3eff«rsonlaa
light, a bottle of cream, and two box
es of red raspberries. “It’s your
grandma’s surprise for supper,” he
whispered. “The raspberries are the
srst we’ve picked this year. Put the
cream down in the cellar right away. ’ ’
Marion danced off to do his bid
ding, though she could hardly keep
from whispering the secret to mam
ma.
At five o’clock grandma arose.
“Well, I guess I’ll go in and get sup
per. Marion has done about enough
for one day,” she said quietly.
“Oh, no, indeed, grandma! I can
help. ’ ’ Marion sprang up with a mer
ry twinkle in her eyes.
But her mother caught her hand
and held it fast. “Grandpa,” she
said huskily, “what do you think of
a little girl who gave up the Sunday
school picnic that she had been look
ing forward to for weeks in order to
take care of her sick mother, brother,
and sister, and has worked hard all
this hot day bravely and cheerfully,
without a word of complaint?”
Marion put one hand over her moth
er’s mouth. “Oh, mamma, I cried
at first!” she said contritely.
“Don’t blame ye,” grandpa put in.
Grandma Davis was standing near
the back door. “I think I remember
a little girl onee, many years ago,
•who did something like that,” she
said softly, and there were tears in
her eyes.
“I know. It was mamma!” Ma
rion cried.
“Yes, dear, it was,” grandma ad
mitted.
“Now, look here, grandma’’—
Grandpa Davis was always practical
—“we’ve got to do something for
these children. Here’s Billy Boy been
suffering with that old toothache and
Marion had to give up her picnic.
Let’s see. We’ll be all through hay
ing by Friday. How would it be if
Hen and I (Henry was the hired man)
drove in with two wagons, and plenty
of new, sweet hay in ’em, bright and
early Saturday morning? You young
uns get a round dozen or so of your
classmates together and •we’ll have a
‘Sunday school picnic of our own out
at the farm.”
“0! And I’ll bring Ethel Saund
ers. She offered to stay at home with
me today!” Marion exclaimed de
lightedly.
“Sure! Bring ’em all!” grandpa
agreed.
Never was there such a super as
that which grandma had ready when
they went in. Not since her father’s
death had Marion seen her mother so
cheerful and bright. And never did
Marion feel any happier than when
she got into bed that night; for the
sweetest of all joys is that which
grows out of self-sacrifice.—Child

THE PETTIGREW DISPATCH.
A dispatch says that Ex-Senator
Pettigrew of South Dakota while
traveling with W. J. Bryan in that
state Monday of this week, publicly
announced that in 1904 he had been
approached by a representative of
the Republican national committee
and offered SIO,OOO dollars if he
would make ten speeches for Watson.
He says he wrote a letter asking
twenty thousand dollars and the com
mittee refused to give it. All of
which goes to show that Pettigrew
tried to pull the Republican leg for
twenty thousand and failed. His
alleged talk about an offer having
been made him he could easily fabri
cate, but his letter is in cold black
and white and .we presume he is afraid
it will be published on him and he is
burning the grass between him and
exposure. All the Western Populist
states went back to the Republicans
when the people quit voting the Popu
list ticket. What would the Republi
cans want them to vote the Populist
ticket for? The Populists carried
Kansas and Nebraska and North Da
kota and elected a U. iS. Senator in
South Dakota. Then when the Demo
crats scattered the People’s party to
the four winds those states went Re
publican by stupendous majorities.
The last thing the Republicans’ want
to see is a Populist revival in those
states. No wonder they turned down
Pettigrew’s offer.
It is well known that in 1904 Jim
Ferriss the Populist national chair
man, advanced money for campaign
expenses and never got all of it back.
The entire expenses of the Populist
national committee were less than
four thousand dollars and this w’as
collected in dribs from Populists, ex
cept about five hundred dollars which
Ferriss advanced and has never been
repaid. This year the Populist
national committee hasn’t enough
money to keep open headquarters,
even though it might be done for
SIOO a month. Only yesterday the
editor of the World got a letter
urging him, as Secretary of the
national committee, to remove the
Populist national headquarters from
St. Louis to Chillicothe, but to do so
he would have to go down in his own
pocket, and hire an editor to run the
World. In my thirty years as editor
and committeeman in the reform
party I have never known of a dollar
of old party money to be used by
Populists. If anything of the kind
has been done it has been by indi
viduals on bheir own responsibility
and kept very secret. Os course in
1896 when the Populists fused on
Bryan there was a considerable fund,
furnished mostly by Democrats, but
even then this editor didn’t see a
dollar of it nor did he want to.
The great trouble with the People’s
party has been it has never had funds
with which to put organizers and
speakers in the field. Right now a
great harvest of votes is going to
waste for the lack of money to make
a campaign with.
Pettigrew, who is trying to throw
a cloud on the People’s party, is a
former Republican and went with the
Bryan movement because he thought
it would have the electing of a U. S t
