I read somkwhere In a newspaper, that
Mr Edison asked a rather tnqurisiltv lady,
who was in his offi<, if one knew the
three quickest modes of ecmmrntcattion to
the outside world, and the lady said stis
knew two, telegraph and telephone; tic
cold her she was imminently corect, but
there was an older one, viz: telegraph,
telephone and tel'-woman. I expect she
got mad, but the story stops there. Ano I
must add some tellermar, Just as some
women, along that line we are vurnulug
cow, to, lengthen out our story, and
not make it too plain and Insipid to read at
all. Now. 1 never said this, so n dear
lady friends must not fall out with me. for
1 love them al'. Fir the B ble says, love
everybody, so 1 will never miss Glory by
not loving somebody, "tor somebody'e ei es

we love "this here state," and its prom
salog future, which lies ahead. "'ts sweet

these, is the Brst and passlenate love. It
