Whenever and W'herever
Diseases of a choleraic type prevail, or si
there is cause to appIrehend a visit from el
them, the syvhten should be toned, regu- d
lated and reinforced bv a course ot Hos- a
tetter's Stomach Bitters. Perfect diges- t
tion and a regular habit of ,body are the a
best safeguards against such maladies, s
and both are secured by this inestimable v
tonic and alterative. The Bitters are c
also extremely serviceable in remedyinug
Ssuch disorders. If promptly taken in
t- bilions colic, diarrhwia and cholera mot
|ibus, the disease is usually frustrated. i
Y In diiarrhlua cases, it is only necessary to
it restore' tlhe tonei of the relaxed hIowels,
and this is one of the specific effects of
Sthis meudicire. Wind on the le stomach
heart brim, liionsness, nausea, headiache
and other symptoms of disturbance in
the gstriCe and hepatic regions are also
wspediily relieved by this excellent renie
adl. As a family medicine it is invalua
ble, sinle it promptly and completely
remedies those alimients which are of
most frequent occurrence.

REPORT OF FINANCE COMMIT
22 00 TEE.
2500 NATCHITOCHES, LA.,
July 9th, 1878.
To the Hon. President and Members of
342 30 the Police Jury.
2500 GENTLEMEN :
You Committee, to whom has been
referred by you, several claims which S. B. Croc
have been passed upon by former Police Powell &
Juries for services rendered by several W. B. PoH
parties in former years, deem it proper Peo.le's V
3 to submit our views in full on these and People's
all other claims which burden your de.
3 liberations,. with the hope that the pub
lic will understand your power in the
premises, and the utter imposibility
0 within the law, which you are bound
and sworn to obey, to render them aid lfred
o by acting on these said claims or others Alfred Hi
of like import. Passing over. the fact W. A. Hi
b that these claims have been submitted John M.
to, acted upon, and approved by several A. P. Bri
former legal bodies legislating for this
parish in your present capacity, which Ho
vests them with as much legal power J . Ho
and fojce as they would have if you Jno. Caun
Do acted upon them a hundred times in as Numa Dc
many days; they occupy the impreg- F. A.Me:
50 nable position of legal and authentic Clerk's 0
obligations, which the parish in its cor- William'
00 porate capacity owes. The justice of John Col
these claims is not for us to consider any M. C. Bro
20 more than to sympathise with the
claimants. The facts, however, which
estop us from rendering aid, are such as
30 to render any effort of ours to that end John Col
impossible; these facts are embedded in H. H. H
33 law which controls our actions, and z. T. w
which we cannot subvert. W. B. C
00 Act No. 30, Sections 1, 2 and 3, Gen H. B. N
eral Assembly at its Session of 1877, P. L. P
states in terse terms, "that the reve
00 nues of the several parishes and muni.
cipal corporations of this State, of each
150 year, shall be devoted to the expenditures Cha
of that year, provided, that any surplus On m,
S00 of said revenues may be applied to the Tuesday
i payment of indebtedness of former (Sign
years.
We simply refer these several claim
6 ants and the public generally to this
2 law, which we consider wise indeed. If
we allowed and paid claims of former
8 40 years from the revenues of this, then
the expenses now incurred would submit
0 00 to the same delay as those now under
attention, and the financial condition of
7 our parish, instead of being bettered, I
000 would become more confused and inter
minable than they are at pres at. The
5 00 poverty of our people speaks louder On N
than we possibly can, as a reason why 1878, tl
5 00 we cannot levy taxes to meet this large chitoch
floating debt (had we the l1al power to the hot
500 do s,) left us as a curse by our late '
Radical opplressors. We judge that at H
some future time, when our citizens have
155 recovered from their present extreme The
financial depression, they will provide and on
750 means to meet these claims. But at On r
present, we consider it our duty as leg- Ann B
250 islators, representing, as we do, the the Pi
00property in erests of this parish, to im of two
pose as little taxation as possible upon I.
0 the present overburdened interests of our let, O
eople. With that view, we respect- ordain
2500 fPlly submit that it is not within our oil of
power legally to use the current funds passe
25 00 now being collected for current expen- tive t
sea for the settlement of these claims. cit li
1666 nor will the property of the citizen at
this time bear any additional burden. origin
12 M Your Committee would respectfully relati
recommend the return of the Claims to lihios
the parties in ownership, with these force
10 00 reasons assigned. sag
