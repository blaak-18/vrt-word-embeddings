"A UMagnificent Conception, wonderfully

SThim necessity of a popular medium for
the representation of the productions of
our great artists, hlus always heen recog.
i7zedl, and malny attempts have been
made to nimeet thlt want. The successive
failures which 14o invaribly followed e:'t:h
attemnpt in this country to estab;lish an
art journal, did not prove the inllitfl'r
ence, of the pelllile of Americ to the
claims of high a;;,. So soon ai a proper
appreciation of the waint aid an ability
to meet it we!ie shown, the public at
once rallied with enthd!silisiu to its setp
port, and the reuiilt witd a great artist ic
and commereil;cil.ln, thn ITHiE.ALIN 1,.
THE ALDINE, whil iaiued with adl the
regularity, has ntone df the temp|,orary or

peat .dicals. It Is idi elegant iuiscellhly
of pure, light and, graceful literature; slid
a collection of iliatures, the rarest spec:i
ncens of artistic skill, in black and white.
Although each stieeding.unmber affolrds
a.fresh plleainre. tl its friends, the real
value andll beauty of the Ar.ltI,i r'ill be
-most appreciated afii; !it h; he11en bound

Intely without competition in price or I
character. The possessor of a completet
volume cannot duplicate the qualnt!ty of
fine paper and engravings in an Q] thiltlr
shape or number of volumnes for ttji fhlues
its cost ; and then, there is tie Uhrnulo
besides!
anthioaai feature of. TIl ALDINE
must he taken in no narrpw sense. TrLiue
art is cosmiopolitan. Whili THE AL
i)INE is a strictly Atlericiln Institutin,on
it does not coflute Itself entitely to the t
reproduction of iiiilti e art. Its mission
is to cultivate a bio:ltd mid t ljlpreciativ\e
strt taste, que that will discrimimnate onli
di gronaids of intrinsic merit. Thus,
while placing before the patrons of THE
ALDIHE, as a leading characteritio, the
productions of the most noted Amelricanl
artists, attention will ,ilways he -iven to
specimens from foreign masters, giving
subscribers all the pleasure and instrne- 1
tion obtainable from home or foreign
Sources.
The artistic illustration of American
scelnry, original with THE ALDINE, is
an important feature, and its magniticent
plates are of a size more appropriate to
tihe satisfactory treatment of details
than can be afforded Iby any inferior
page. The judicious interspersion of
landcape,. marine, figure, and animal
subjects, sustain an unabated interest,
impossible where thet scope of the work
confines the srtiat,too closely to a single
style of subjects The literature of TIlE
ALDINE is a light aldt graceful accom
paniment, worthy of tie. artistic fea- i
t!ires, with only such techlicaitl disqrvisi
tions as do not jilterfere trith the lopn
lar Interest of tlib work.
