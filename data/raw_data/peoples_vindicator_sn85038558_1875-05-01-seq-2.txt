Time Wasted.
The action of our members in the
lower house in being led into the
impeachment of Auditor Clinton,
however guilty he may be, at this 2mo
ment, can be looked upon only with
Csispicion. We are well aware that
the whole extreme Radical party
were loudly clamorous for the politi
cal death of this individual, and un
der the specious cry of dishonest ac
tions, have at last succeeded in bring
lug about his impeachment. But the
honest citizens of Louisiana will stop
to inquire if this. action, which could
only be consumated with the assist
ance of the Conservatives, was not a
trick of the faction now in the Gene
ral Assemblly, which represents the
remains of the thieves and robbers
that have so long and so well stripped
our fair State of her resourses and
her wealth, to deter the real men,
pure in purpose, from inaugurating
those measures of reform so essential
to the well being of our society and
government. In other words, could
not this impeachment of Auditor
Clinton have been delayed, along
with other measures of political leg
islation, until the regular meeting of
the Assembly next January, and the
valuable nmoments spent in this trial
used to pass beneticiary and reforma
tory laws for Louisiana. We think
so, and as the question now presents
itself, we are of the opinion that the
Conservative members of the Legis
lature have shown but little wisdom
to say the least of it, in allowing
themselves deterred from acting up
on such legislative matters as the
exigencies of our situation demand
ed. The people at home are clamor
ous for relief; bad laws are to be
repealed and good ones enacted, and
we cannot conceive how the members
of the legislature are to satisfy them
with such acts as the impeachment of
Clinton. Better far we had had noth
ing to do with our State affairs ; had
left it all in the hands of Kellogg's
4crowd, than had us charged with such
unsatisfactory reasons for so much
sacrifice.
The Conservative element in Lou
isiana have suffered themselves led
into the belief that real practical
good would come of this compromise;
we ourselves have labored to the ut
most of our humble ability to bring
about submission and quiet our peo
ple to a trial of its virtue, but when
put upon its probation and the men
who were its advocates and were to
act as the champions for relief, turn
aside from the cries of their own
people for succor, and spend the pre
cions hours, which shopld be devoted
to them in useless and idle acts, (for
the time at least) of four days spent
in organizing, and four more spent in
seating members with the remaining
two flitted away in impeaching Au
ditor Clinton, it will require some
thing more than ithis to answer the
opponents of Compromise, or even
decently satisfy any one in Louisiana.
As the case dow presents itself
some one has been made a precious
ass of, either the people or their rep.
resentatives in New Orleans, and as
we have tod· much respect for, and
confidence in the whole body of Lon
isiaua's citizens to charge them with
such as being their fate, a regard at
least for these members, compel us
to the belief that the "onsiervative
l egislture has "done fl1e deed." It
seems strange.. "'yet 'tie true," that;
our country suffers ais much from the
imbecility of its friends as from 'thie
spoliation of its enemies, and. such
to-day is our sublinme condition. Sad
fate for poor Louisiana which leads
us to exclaim, "save us from our
friends.".
A bill has boen passed during
the call session of the Legislature
to' 'relieve from taxation, all lier
sons whose lands were overflowed
last year. This is d good lai4hnd
will be beneficial to- a Itirge class
of our impoverished citizens.

The Last and Lout Hope.
To whom can the people of Lou
isiana now turn for assistance I We
have been asked to yield our convic
tious; convictions fixed by all the
precedents of the past six years, and
to enter into an agreement with the
Republicans for the sake of peace
and immediate reform in the future.
Gov. Kellogg in carrying out this ad
justment called an extra session of
the General Assembly and the ten
days during which they have been
convened, has been flitted away in a
most shameful manner. The blamh
for all this can only be attached to
our own mIembers, who, instead of
going to work to pass reformatory
laws, suffered themselves to drift into
useless contests and idle acts, over
the election of a Speaker, seating
members and the i'utieachlmuent, at
tempted "rather, of the Auditor.
Meanwhile Louisiana, the sick pa
tient, whose ailment cries aloud for
immediate attention, is suffered to
.languish and perish. Remedies which
could now be applied with benefit
are left unprescribed, and our poor
deluded citizens must bear and be
strong yet many days. This is sim
ply outrageous, and we consider it
to be one of the most damnable in
sults ever offered a sutfTring people.
Tricked, deceived, insuilted by our
own law-makers, our chosen reprosen
tatives; who will we next apply to
for succor or assistance I Has virtue
fled our citizens also, and is there no
patriotism left in the hearts of our
people I
Hlope has been held out to us as a
precious balm to our ills, and now
that glimmering light has been ex
tingnished. It is useless to argue
I that "the reform" will take place
s next session, this would be more out
Srageous than the death of our late
r wishes; it is useless to argue that
the principles of party demanded that
I our representatives should act as
º they have done during this extra ses
sion, we abandoned all parties; all
a precedents of political orglanizations,
wlten we accepted the adjustment. And
here arq we to-day in a worse condi
I tiou than at any time within the past
Itwo years, for we have yielded all
opposition with the hope, alas ! how
vain, that reliance could be placed in
our own representatives who "would
control at least the command of the
I situation.
SWith the present lights before us
we are compelled to the admission
a that we have been surrendered to the
enemy, horse, foot and dragoons, by
the weakness and imbecility of our
I own commanders.
By what system of reasoning these
eesolons will attempt to satisfy their
I constituents, we care not to know;
sophistry and fair promises will be
but poor logic with which to soothe
the feelings of deep-seated conviction.
Our people are ruined well nigh,and
no excuse can be offered for this
shameful abandbnment of succor to
f them. Themeasures which we de
a oranded were few and reasonable,
Sand should the Republicans have re
I fused their assistance in the enact
I ment of such laws, upon their heads,
Sand tlheirs along, would rest all the
a blame. Instead of this we are rede
Sced to the hopteless task of defending
I our owli membhar from thle imputa

There'seems to be great feelings

It makes no differance whether the
Hahn IIouse passed a law, or what
purports to be a law, or net, our duty
is to vote and elect oflicials of our
choice, and then let the Governor get
them out if he can. We have sub
mitted to Ilia'appointments without
a word thus far, but tlkis thing must
be compromised with us now; last
year all our troubles sprung from in
ferance with the city government and
the Governor and his frinds may pro- :
fit by that example.
We are aware that we may be con- I
sidered obtrusive in speaking of the
city government of Mayor DeVargas
for the past year, as all are willing to
award to him and his able city Coun
cil, just praise. However, as we hear 1
f that a ticket is being- placed iii the
- field by the "party Republicans," for
no reason that we can see, save to be
factious, we would beg to call the
3 attention of our citizens to the names
a upon that ticket, and ask themselves
the question whether they are enti
tied to consideration t Does not in
competency sit prominent at its head.
- Joseph Ezernack may be a good citi
" zen; a good farmer, but lie can only
write his name meehanicallyr; is ana
ble to read, and therefore is totally
a incompetent for Mayor, or any other
Sofficial position. We do not say this
- in anger or insult, but simply as a fact,
a and further that we understand the
- tax-payers as unwilling to allow any
one to legislate or manage their af
' false who is not fully competent. The
- city now suffers the loss of $4,300
from one of the shining lights of the
R6publican party, and we are all
q. quite cured of them as a party in our
city afftirs. We fail to see the name
of a single person upon the Radical
ticket that can cotlnand itself to'tlhe
consideration of the city tax-payers,
while no one can advance one objec.
- tion to any one upon thie people's
e ticket. They have been tried, and
I have made good and eficient officers,
and we feel assured our people do
- not intend to excbange them for un
n known and incompetent parties.
e C. Chaplin has been appointed judge
I the 17th Judicial District nod M. J.
h Cunningham District Attorney. We
have notliing to say in opposition to
I, the qualifications of Mr. Chbaplia, he
- is a gentleman in every way qualified
and acceptable to our people, still thi
; injustice and Ilagtnt violation of the
d voice of the people is what. we cear
plain of. Mr. Jack waselected b a
. large majority to this position, and
, as a matter of right anit justice, should
have had it; but is seems that he has
Sbeen classed by some of our "step
ins" as violent in polities to which
,. clams the Governor assisted by the
u "moderates" will give ne preferment,.
Mr. Chaplin joined in a petition to
insist upon Mr. Jack's appointment
- but the prayer ifae peremtorally re
- faused.
We opine that next year. demand
. willbe made for Conservative strength

quite a funeral to the tax-payef.

that this ofice is rmun at lees <epei"'
