AMERICAN WOMEN SURPASS IN
BRAINS.
The quality that is most striking
in American girls is their intellig
ence, says Mr. Mucha, the artist, in
the New Idea Women’s Magazine for
August. This is a form of .femininity
to which we foreigners are not ac
customed. Your women think with a
mind as clear as the average man’s.
That comes from training.
Through careful study I have
concluded that the American woman’s
brow is higher than the brow of wo
men of any other country This is
the result of generations and genera
tions of women who have thought,
and it is the desire of the men belong
ing to this country to have women
for their good companions that have
developed this thought and brow. The
man of your country loves and de
mands intellectual response in his
womankind.
I have found a delightful com
bination in your men and women.
This is a recognized commercial
country. The man must think on
commercial subjects. He has but
little time for art and the idealistic.
He deals with cold facts and reality.
This has developed iir him a strong
jaw; he had a bull-dog tenacity
which luas made his country what it
is today, and the effect of ..this
thought, effort and determination
has developed this square, strong
jaw.
This turning of the man’s thoughts
to commercial pursuits has left
music, art and literature to your wo
men They have been forced to
develop these arts, which the men
love but have no time to cultivate.
With the developing of them and the
thought and brain power necessary
for their accomplishment, you have
a high brow and a clear, refined brain.
This combination is glorious, and one
found in the women of no other
country.
Croker, 1 i Tammany’s Prophet,” is
supporting Bryan this season. Noth
ing strange about? that. Croker made
his pile working the people. So has
Bryan. “A fellow feeling makes us
wondrous kind.” —Col. George.
IT IS TO LAUGH!
It gives us a pain to see papers,
like the Sparta Ishnjaelite and Way
nesboro True-Citizen foaming at the
mouth, concerning Tom Watson’s
attitude in Georgia politics. When
Hoke iSniith and his Democratic
allies, two years ago, swallowed the
Populist platform, including Mr.
Watson, bag and baggage, it was all
right. Not a dissenting word did we
hear from the Istmaelite z or True-
Citizen when the Miller executive
committee let down the bars and
asked every white man in Georgia to
come in and participate. Not a word
said about future loyalty. On the
other hand, the Smith papers were
terribly wrought up when the Yeo
man’s executive committee, of four
years lago, attempted to have a real
Democratic primary by putting a
caption on the ballot, endeavoring to
force the real thing. It is a matter
of history, as to what happened to
the faction to which the Yeoman’s
committee had allegiance. The Ish
maelite and True-Citizen together
assisted in putting that committee out
of business. In its place arose a com
mittee that absolutely fawned, pan
dered to and swallowed the Populists.
Now, that the present executive
committee, the members of which
were taught a few political tricks by
the other wiiig, propose to profit
thereby, a great howl goes up.
However, the present committee is
setting “steady in the boat,” and
propose to feed the other fellow out
of his own spoon.
Ha! ha! ha! It is to laugh.—-
Greensboro, (Ga.) Herald.
Greensboro Herald-Journal: Won
der if Yancey is any relation to the
“more than Carter had oats” man.
* * * AVith the legislature, Yan
cey Carter and the high waters on
hand, Georgia is in a devil of a fix.
It is a curious medley of affairs
when one section of Democracy is
seeking to disfranchise the negro
while another section, under the di
rect leadership of Bryan is fishing to
catch the negro vote to insure the
election of the National Democratic
ticket. —'Randolph Bulletin.
