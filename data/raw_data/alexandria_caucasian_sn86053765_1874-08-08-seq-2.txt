The Agricultural Fair Association.
This Association is now putting
up additional and much uecdcd
buildings upon their Fair Grounds,
and are much in need of a small
amount of oasb. Thoy therefore
earnestly appeal to all Stockholders
who owe for Stock, to come for
ward and pay up at once. They
reqnest all liberal oitizens to assist
them by taking new stock and pay
ing for the same. If any libera)
gentleman has, say, Five Hundred
Dollars to loan them on good secu
rity, they would be glad to borrow
that amount for a short time.
It will aid them greatly if per
sons will buy ai once their Lottery
Tickets, which are now out and for
sale. These gentlemen deserve
great credit, and should meet with
every encouragement at the hands
of our people iu whose interests
they are laboring.

The Mass Meeting to-day of the
people in their sovereign capacity
is of great importance to the wel
fare of Rapides, ami it behooves all
who attend, to have before them
the idea of this importance, that
they may act discreetly, judge
wisely and decide the questions
that come before them in a quiet,
ihgmfled and cnlm spirit. The
meeting is called by the people<~it
is the {icoplc'd meeting, and the
people themselves are to decide
what particular li'ie of policy they
will pursue. It is emphatically a
people's, and not a political meet
ing iu the ordinary sense ot the
word. Political clap trap and po
litical axe grinding must have no
place in the deliberations of the
meeting. Foreusic d if play of bom
bastic eloquence is not needed and
ought not to be indulged. There
will be there men of different ideas
and holdiug fust to divergent views
as to the necessity of the hour and
the course to be pursued, and as
they arc all equally honest in their
opinions, it is of the' utmost impor
tance that all should be actuated
by a conciliatory spirit, and that
all should be anxious to lind some
name or plan upon which we can
make the ooming campaigu as a
on it. No man should be so wedded
to his particular views and ideas
as that he will not be ready and
willing to sacrafice them for the
sake of peace and harmony.
A captious condemnation of or
factious opposition to the Demo
cratic party will embitter feelings
and perhaps bring about an oppo
sit ion that will lie fatal to us in the
coming campaign. Any such course
towards the White Man's Party
would certainly arouse indignation
and drive from the ranks of any
other party that might bo adopted,
some of the best and most patriotic
of our people.
There will be there some of our
staunchest men, who will advocate
the adoption of the name " Con
st native," with the line of policy
indicated by that name, for the
adoption of the meeting. Now it
is evident that only a conciliatory
spirit can deal with these opposing
views ; and it is earnestly to I ks
hoped that that spirit will prevail
throughout the deliberations of the
meeting.
Besides the adoption fif a name
and a line of policy, it will be the
province of this meeting to call a
Convention of delegates from the
different wards to nominate a par
tali ticket, and also to appoint
Parish Central Committee to con
duct the campaign. This last will
be a delicate task, as it is absolute
ly necessary that the committee
should be men who have the confi
dence of the entire community, and
who shall besides be men of firm
ness and resolution, prepared to
take prompt and effective steps to
preveut and punish any attempt at
any fraud or chicanery on the part
ot our radical opponents. They
will, doubtless, attempt to take ad
vantage ot the uew registration to
swindle us, if we do not evince a
détermination not to be swindled.
Wo suggest in this particular in
stance a departure from the general
rule, so as to elect the Committee
instead of appointing them. Let
the proceedings be harmonious, the
deliberations quiet, and all efforts
be to secure unanimity and enthu
siasm iu the coming campaign.
As for ourselves, we have only a
word to say. We have given to the
advocacy of the cause of the White
Man's Party our undivided time
and the whole of whatever talent
we may have had. We have
thought all along, and we see now
no reason to change our belief, that
that party will liest unite the white
people of this parish, and will be
most certain to secure our succès*.
We have no means of knowing
what the majority of the people of
the parish think upon the subject,
but wo will advocate its adoption
in the Convention and if it is
adopted we shall be proud and
elated, but if some other name
should be taken, we pledge our
selves to support it, to battle for
and with the people and their
rights to the bitter end. We are
uot so wedded to our idea as that
a failure on the part of the people
to endorse it will dampen onr ardor
or diminish our labors in their be
halt. The Caucasian wiil be ever
in the front ranks. Will stay uutil
the enemy are routed, and will
count no sacrifice of time or means
iu defense of the true and honest
people of Rapides. Organize and
let us at the «nemy together!

i'stttle is Akts. ..&» mi>i* it 6e,

We intend to fight the particu
lar Rail R om ) proposition now be
fore the Polite Jury and which they
are called upon to present to the
people, to the last gasp. We will
d e mighty hard in the last ditch if
that scheme ever gets through. The
Democrat asks ns why we are un
willing to have it pnt to the peo
ple if they are opposed to it, and
why not let it go before them and
let them vote it down. Wo answer,
for three reasons. First. Because
It is an insult to their intelligence
for the Police Jury to submit any
such outrageous proposition to
them. Second. Because these are
days when it is possible by chican
ery and fraud to cheat the people
out of their will. The ballot boxes
might somehow get stuffed or there
might be made a big mistake in
counting the votes. Third. Be
cause of the useless expense of
holding the election. We can very
readily understand the anxiety of
the Rail Road men to get this prop
osition put to a vote. They think
that with their interest in the prop
osition they could and would get
out the votes of every advocate of
it ; it would be their businessjo see
to this; but no body would make
it their special business to get out
all the opponents and the election
would be carried by default. It is
this nice little "heathen Chinee"
game that we want to nip iu the
Police Jury, but if it should go
through that body, we will see that
every man in the parish shall know
the importance of voting against
this scheme. They have got the
two other pa|K»rs here yoked up in
Rail Road harness, but we reach as
many readers in one issue as both
the others put together, and we
have got a job office that can turn
out anti Rail Road circulars as fast
as they can. "Lay on McDuff 1"
Come on now gentleman and we
will have a nice lively time ou this
particular scheme.
The Democrat says too, that we
gave the Police Jury bad advice.—
We do not admit its right to set it
self up for Judge. We except to
the jurisdiction of the Court, ratione
materiae et ratione ■personne. We are
arguitig before the people and for
them. Answer our arguments if
you can, Mr. Democrat , but do not
set yourself up as Judge and jury.
The same Rail Road authority says
also that it is a gratuitous assump
tion of ours that the principal would
aihave t 0 be paid vearly or even pro
.. , , ' ., . , '
vided for at all at prosent. Now
let see. Ray's Revised Statutes p.
545, Section 278G, says:
"The Police .juries of the several parishes
and the constituted authoiities of incor
porated towns and cities in this State
shall not hereafter have power to contract
(my délit, or pecuniary liability, without
fully providing i- the ordinanse creating the
debt, the means of paying the principal
and interest of the «lebt contracted. The
italics are ours.
Now how about paying the prin
cipal !
We have tried our best and can
not get the Rail Road gentlemen
off of the glittering generalities in
which they indulge so lavishly.—
They have scrupulously avoided
meeting ns upon the question of a
quaranty that tliey will build any
more of the road after we have
given them as they ask. #480,000 or
#30,000 a mile tor building the six
teen miles from Alexandria to Le
coinpte. That is a question they
do not like to talk about, but how
they do glory in talking about
"fields blooming as the rose," "#100
an acre," "work for poor mechan
ics" and all such bosh. We don't
wish to discuss tho benefit« of a
Rail Road, if built, but the ques
tion, do you really intend to build
the roadl
Let the Police Jury make some
such counter proposition as this to
these gentlemen: The Parish will
give you lier bonds bearing 5 per
cent interest, for Five Thou
sand Dollars per mile for every
mile you build through the par
ish, to be delivered when you have
completed every mile or ten miles,
Provided, that your road is in com
plete running order from the lower
line of the parish to New Orleans
or fiam the upper line to Shreve
port, before you commence in this
parish ; and provided further that
the^A bond? shall b* secured by se.
cowl mortgage on the road or by
pledge of Stock of the road to a suf
ficient amount to cover them.
This is only a suggestion, bnt
some such proposition would meet
with a favorable reception from the
people. We are opposed in toto to
any absolute donation. If these
gentleman are poor and want to
borrow money, the parish will lend
it to them upon proper security
or it will take stock, but the peo
ple are uot ' willing to give their
money away.
If they are unwilling to accept
some such proposition, and are de
termined to have jnst what tliey
want, then let the Police Jury treat
them as they deserve and refuse to
have anything to do with them,
tliey can't force the Jury nor will
they try it. The beggar who says
he will only take a ten dollar gold
piece and won't have greenbacks,
would be treated with scorn and
contempt. Tliat is just the attitude
of these gentlemen. Let tbetn study
the wisdom of the old saying:
"Beggars must not be choosers."
New Orléans aad a State Convention.
From the Onchita Telegraph.
It makes no difference to us
where the Democratic State Con
vention shall assemblo. except that
it ought to meet at some piace, no
matter where, where the fullest at
tendance can lie had. We wn nf
the people's delegates gathered to
gether from evqjy parish in the
State. If tho people select good
men, their delegates can be trusted
to deliberate either oil the Missis
sippi or the Onacliita or Red river,
or iu the deepest recesses of the
backwoods. The objections urged
against New Orleans, as the place
of meeting for the Democratic
State Conveutiou, seem to us not
onM a confession ot weakness on
the part of .lie country parishes,
c bnt tho act does New Orleans a
great injustice. There are many
bad men and bad influences there,
it is true ; but which is predomi
nant, the good or the bad T
Let ns recall the fact, that of the
Fusion legislature the memb.rs
from New Orleans have a better re
coid for devotion to the people's
cause than the members from the
country. New Orleans, to-day,
if she would, tell the country, it
was your representatives, not ours,
who went into Kcllogg's legislature.
New Orleans might ask the coun
try, who sustained the cause of the
people at Washington, and extend
ed thousands of dollars ill the ef
fort! Who furnished the talent,
who kept up the contest, who has
maintained the fight?
And when the case of the Grant
Parish Prisoners came on, and they
were confronted with a trial for life,
without means to employ lawyers
or pay witnesses, it was New Or
leans that supplied them. The
Committee of Seventy in New Or
leans has raised and expended
thousands of dollars to maintain
the opposition to Kellogg, and has
presented to the country a mass of
facts in newspapers, in pamphlets
and addresses, the good effect of
which has been seen throughout the
whole Union. The country parish
es cannot forget these things. New
Orleans has done a noble part, and
deserves the gratitude of the peo
pie ot the entire State.
Pious But Human .—There is a
wealthy, selfish, somewhat arro

Chester County, who, understand

a little earlier tba:; his neighbors,
thus getting the pick of hands and
plenty of time. His farm is on an
elevated range and comprises 200
or 300 acre«. Last summer stand
ing on the bridguof his barn as the
last load of hay was taken in, he
took off his hat, passed his hand
kerchief over his face, pnlled down
his vest, and gave it an extra
smoothing, then, casting Iiis eyes
over the landscape where hundreds
of farmers were mowing and cur

and satisfying tone. "A little rain

—— «
We pnblish below in their order,
tbe action of Governor McEnery
and others In reference to tbe State
Convention ; tbe reply of tlie Dem
ocratic Central Committee; the let
ter ot Governor McEnery to tbe
Committee ; and finally tbe resoln
♦ion s passed by the Committee of
Seventy, advising the Central Com
rnittee of tbe Democratic Party to
change the place to Baton Rouge
and to so modify the call as to
leave the shaping ot tbe whole
course of the campaign as to name,
enunciation ot principles etc., to
that Convention when it shall have
assembled.
We endorse the action of the
Committee of Seventy without re
serve or hesitation. That has ull
aloug been our idea as to the char
acter of a Convention that we ought
to have and we stand fair and
square with thé Committee of sev
enty. We presume that the Dem
ocratic Central Committee will com
ply with the request of the Com
mittee of Seventy and if they do
tbe muddle is over and ull will be
plain sailiug. If they do not we
shall oppose the present call for the
4th Monday of August at New Or
leans, if for no other reason than
because tbe Central Committee
shall have been Go stubborn about
a matter upon whioh it is now so
easy for them to gracefully yield.

a convention op representa
tives of the people
asked for.
Monroe, La ., July 21, 1874.
The action of tbe Democratic
Central Committee, calling a con
vention to assemble at New Orleans
on the 4th Monday in August next
has certainly been unfavorably re
ceived by the neople of the country
parishes. Several papers published
at different points have repudiated
that action and called for a conven
tion to be held out of New Orleans.
It seems probable that dissension
will arise, unless steps are immedi
ately taken to prevent it, which
may prove fatal to the hopes of
those who desire to see the State
of Louisiana redeemed. We think,
however, that all the differences
can be reconciled,» and all those
who wish to rid the State of the in
cubus of radical usurpation can be
uiiited and their combined efforts
made irresistible if those who differ
only as to the means by which to
attain that result will make some
mutual immaterial concessions.
In onr judgment a convention of
the people composed of delegates
chosen by all persons in the State
who arc opposed to carpet-bag gov
ernment should be assembled at
some place iu the country, say Ba
ton Ronge, on 1st of September
next. That convention should be
limited in its numbers, its member*
carefully selected and to it should
bo remitted tbe oiganuation of the
people, and the adoption of a poli
cy for the present campaign.
We believe that the action that
may be taken by a convention so
selected and so held will be nnaui
ftiously endorsed by the white peo
ple of the State, and that unless
such a convention is held, they
cannot be so united.
Satisfied that tbe views herein
announced are those entertained
by a large majority of the white
people of Louisiana, we deem it our
duty to request the Democratic
Central Committee to withdraw
tbeir call for a conventiou at New
Orleans and suggest that they join
in a call for a convention such as
we have herein indicated, and if
this request is complied »itb, we
request all papers throughout the
State which have published calls
for a convention to join also in the
call which may be so made.

COMMITTEE.
CISTUl
July, 23,1874.
Gor. John McEnery, Monroe. La.i
Dear Sir— The Democratic State Central
Committee met yesterday for tlie puroore
of advifing npon the suggestion mane to
change the place for lioldinir the Demo*
cratic 8tnte Convention from New Orleans
to Baton Rouge or some other place.
Yon remember that at the finit meeting
of the committee In Jnne last, the
tion was discussed as to the locality most
advisable, and the city members nniver*
willy ex preened their preferences for tbe
city of Baton Rouge. At thla meeting—
however, the ouly aetlon taken waa to
chII a general meeting of the committee
for the purpose of inaugurating the earn*
PHtgn. Measures were taken to aeenre »
full attendance: notices were given
throngh the press for the meeting of Jnly
7.1874, and personal notices were forth
with forewarned to every delegate la the
parishes.
At this general meeting a country del*
Kate, seconded hy another,moved that the
Convention lie held at New Orleans. Six
conntry delegates sp»ke earnestly in favor
of the motion, and the city delegates yield*
ed to their desires
It can lie only a matter of convenions*
to hold the convention at on* pi ice rather
than ot another ; and the New Orlenna
people wonld, at any time, cheeifuHy
adopt any locality that Is mots acceptable
to their conntry friends.
Bnt, coupled with the snggestion for a
change of locality, there is a formal do
mand npon the Democratic State Central
Committee to prononnce the dissolution of
the Democratic party and to assume to
join in sn informal call for a convention
to organize another party
This committee has only mandatory
powers ; it has no right to pursue the
couine suggested ; and, besides after ma
ture considération, it lias come to the con
clusion that tli« suggestion is not aonnd.
The docainent alluded to suggests mutual
"immaterial coHceeeion»'' liut concUvlex with
a $tne qua non that, the Democratic Stat«
Central Committee countermand its call
for a Democratic State Convention, and
"jaiu to a call for a Convention, tuck at «es
(the eignere » have herein indicated."
Tlie Committee unhesitatingly declined
tlie proposition, although not unwilling
in the least to alter the call for another
place to hold the Democratic State Con
vention.
The Committee expccts that, npon fnr
ther consideration, ti.e opposition mani
fested to the policy of cvnductiiig this
campaign under thu anspic s of the Dem
ocratic party, will snhssde snl tliat as in
14(18, all thecoiiservntives will rally nnder
it» banner. I remain, very respectfully,
your obedient servant,

LETTER FROM GOV MCBNEBY.
The following letter will he read
with interest, as it shows how en
tirely in earnest our people are in
this crusade ngainst the enemy, atul
how united all sections of the State
are concerning the means of accom
plishing their purpose :
M onroe , La., July 29,187 4
Dear Sir—1 am glad to learn tliat every
thing is prospering so well politically In
the City. 1 am sure that the white peo*
tie all through the State will oe thorough
y united and organized and tliat we will
carry a majority i" the Legislature.
Everything in this section is moving
smoothly anil well, the only division be
ing as to the place of holding the Conven
tion. Iu itself this is an unimportant
matter, but tlie pcop]« in many of the par
ishes have attaolied great importance toit.
Tili« question, though, will be satisfacto
rily settled, and whether tho Convention
meets in or out of New Orleans, the whito
people will not lie divided on an issue lik«
this, but to insure the most perfect har
mony, I was in hopes the committee
would adjourn the Convention to some
accent,able point in tbe country—say Ba
ton Kongo. Hut, however, the question is
settled—the people will acquiesce, and go
steadily to work to clear out Radicalism.
Yours, J .\o. M c K .nkiiy.
THE COMMITTEE OF SEVENTY
RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED AT ITS
LAST MEETING.
We give below a letter from R.
FI. Marr, Esq., chairman of the
Committee of Seventy, and a copy
ot the resolutions offered by him
and adopted at the meeting of tho
committee held ou Thursday even
ing, the 30th inst :
I deemed it proper to withhold from
publication the resolutions adopted by the
Committee oi Seventy at the meeting on
Thursday night, until tliey ha.l been acted
npon by the Democratic State Central
Committee, but, us incorrect versions of
these resolutions have fourni their way in
to the public press, I think it proper now
to give them publicity precisely as tliey
were adopt et 1 tiy the Committee,' by a vote
of 43 yeas to 7 nays.
The resolutions must speak for them«
selves, and I shall not attempt now to
offer either comment or explanation as to
their scope and purpose.
R. II. M aimi.
Chairman Committee of Seventy.
Whereas, Objections have been made to
tlie call of tho Democratic State Central
Committee for a Convention, to lie held at
New Orleans on the fourth Monday of Au
gust, 1874, which objections, it is under
stood, are based in great part on tlio se.
lection of New Orleans as tbe place of
holding the Convention ;
And whereas. It is of the utmost impor?
taiico that the said Convention should
meet the views, and be n full and fair rep
resentation of the people of Louisiana op
posed to the existing usurpation ; there«
fore be it
lte»olved, 1. That this committee docs,
most earnestly and respectfully, request
the Democratic State Central Committee
to modify the oall for a Convention, so as
to have the Convention, meet at lia ton
Kongo instead of at New Orleans, and to
remit to that Convention the shaping and
conduct oj the ensiling canvass.
2. That a committee of three be appoint
ed to wait upon the Democratic State
Central Committee to present these reso
lutious, and to nrgo this modification.
3. That we approve tbe address of the
State Central Committee, and this commit,
tee will issue an address to the p eupla <if
Louisiana opposed to the existing usurpa
tion, inviting and urging tliein to send del*
égares to that Conventiou upon the basis
of representation as stated in the address
of the Democratic State Central Commit
to* R. II. MARK. President.
