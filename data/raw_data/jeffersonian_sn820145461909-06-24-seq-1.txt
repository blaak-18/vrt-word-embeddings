SPIELING FOR A SHIP SUBSIDY.
According to program, Hon. C. B.
Landis, of Indiana, delivered yester
day his address on “An American
Merchant Marine in its Relation to
Southern Prosperity,’’ before the
Georgia Industrial Association in
session at Warm Springs. As the
Herald had predicted, it was a plea
for the subsidizing of steamship
lines.
Mr. Landis as a member of Con
gress was one of the strongest ad
vocates of ship subsidies, but unlike
his great speech in Congress on this
subject, in his speech yesterday he
minced no words. He called the
spade a spade, and in plain terms
argued that our government shQuld
subsidize certain steamships, which
he claimed was necessary to secure
for our country its proper share of
the ocean carrying service.
Like all advocates of a ship sub
sidy, Mr. Landis finds it necessary
to state his premises incorrectly in
order to make them fit as a founda
tion for the arguments based upon
them. He asserted that “while the
word ‘subsidy’ does not appeal to
American enthusiasm and while it is
to be regretted that any industry
should have to be supported arti
ficially, yet it would seem that if the
United States is ever to have a mer
chant marine it will have to be by
the subsidy method.” Does the his
tory of the past bear out this asser
tion?
There was a time when the Ameri
can merchant marine was inferior
only to England’s, when the Ameri
can flag was seen on every sea, and
the famous American clipper ships
sailed to every port. And it must be
remembered that no subsidies were
then paid to ships. In competition
with the world the American mer
chant marine was acknowledged the
best and secured our full share of
the world’s carrying trade—without
being subsidized. Our country is far
richer now than it was then, and
what our people did then they can
do now if the proper effort is made.
Mr. Landis artfully tried to appeal
to the self-interest of Southern man
ufacturers, to incline them to favor
ship subsidies. He said: “In the
year 1907 Southern cotton mills sent
to South America manufactured
products to the value of $11,313.18.
During the same period England sent
to the South American countries cot
ton cloths and yarns to the value of
$46,083,423. The figures analyzed
show that the export trade of Eng
land to the South American countries
in cotton cloths was nearly six times
greater than our own, while on cot
ton yarns and threads it was fifty
times greater.”
A Weekly Paper Edited by THOS. E. WATSON and J. D. WATSON
Certainly this trade condition
should be reversed, and our country
should supply the bulk of the cotton
goods consumed in South America,
instead of England getting the most
of this trade. But would subsidizing
fast steamships get this trade? Cot
ton goods as a rule are carried in
tramp steamers and sailing vessels,
neither of which are to be sub
sidized; and simply because the gov
ernment paid each American mail
steamer sailing to South American
ports a bounty for each ship sailed
this would not sell our goods in those
markets. The trade must be got by
selling the best goods for the least
money, and whenever our manufac
turers are in a position to do this,
and bring this fact properly to the
attention of foreign customers, they
will sell their goods. And when they
do, the goods will go in unsubsidized
ships, whether these ships fly our
flag or some other.
A ship subsidy is a monstrous evil.
Just like the protective tariff, it
taxes the people as a whole to en
rich a few favored ship owners, who
under the stimulus of a subsidy
would speedily organize themselves
into a shipping trust. It is worse
than the protective tariff because it
is not a revenue measure. It would
bring no money into the national
treasury; it would only take money
out, money collected from the people
and given to a few favored individ
uals. —Augusta Herald.
TAFT AND GRAFT.
The party of Taft and Graft has
decided that the voters of the North
will not stand for another betrayal
by the G. O. P. under Cannon and
Aldrich, they are accordingly using
the tariff to get some of the Southern
States into line—buying them so to
speak with promises of tariff protec
tion on cotton and its bi-products.—

ADVERTISING THAT COUNTED.
An Oklahoma boy put up what he
considered a good joke on his moth
er by advertising in her name for a
busband. He is now being walloped
by a good, stout stepfather, the sur
prised but not at all frustrated moth
er having annexed the first man that
came along, and doing well at that,
as the neighbors all allowed. You
can do anything in this world that is
doable by proper advertising. Let
our Mr. talk with you about
it. —Minneapolis Journal.
DEARER BREAD.
The report of an advance in the
price of bread as a result of the rise
in the values of wheat and flour was
Atlanta, Ga., Thursday, June 24, 1909
to be expected. Wheat being the raw
material of flour and flour the raw
material of bread, an increase in the
cost of the first, whether natural or
artificial, necessitates proportionate
advances in the more finished prod
ucts. The only queston is whether
the upward tendencies have not been
used by combinations and manipula
tors to fill their own pockets out of
the needs of the people. There is no
doubt that a considerable part of
the advance in wheat is due to the
small amount of last year’s crop still
available for marketing. There is
general belief that this legitmate ad
vance has been exaggerated by spec
ulators, says the Pittsburg Chronicle-
Telegraph. As far as this is the case
we may hope that it will be tempo
rary, and that the harvesting of a
good crop this year will restore
prices to a fair basis. There are also
■ indications that a combination of
milling interests has increased the
old margin between the prices of
wheat and flour, and thus established
another squeeze on consumers. These
means of enhancing the cost of prod
ucts cannot be carried very far with
out inevitably increasing the cost of
bread. —Smith County Messenger.
THE IMPERVIOUS MR. ALDRICH.
Nearly anyone except Mr. Aldrich
would have lost composure under the
remarkable denunciations that were
made of the chairman of the Finance
Committee in the Senate on Satur
day, but Mr. Aldrich met it all with
his sarcastic grin. First Mr. Dolliver
and then Mr. LaFollette told him
face to face that he was no longer to
be trusted, and that they could not
accept his statements. Mr. Dolliver’s
attack on Mr. Aldrich was little less
than sensational. The lowan was
even more bitter and vigorous than
in his speech a month ago, which
exceeded in vitriolic power anythng
heard in the Senate in recent sessions
of Congress. Saturday he warned
Senator Aldrich of his intention to
attempt to discredit him and his com
mittee before the country, and de
clared, as the Rhode Islander left the
chamber, that he did so at the peril
of “taking the moral consequences”
of the situation. Bui Mr. Aldrich
has the backing of the trusts and
that makes him impervious to crit
icism.—Alexandria Gazette.
WHAT IS OUR JAPANESE POPU
LATION?
How many Japanese are there in
the United States; and is the num
ber increasing or decreasing? These
are questions that naturally arise
when a recent statement sent out
from Tokio is compared with the
United States census report of 1900.
Then the total number in the United
States and Hawaii was 89,986. The
largest number was in Hawaii, 61,-
111; California came next with 10,-
151; Washington with 5,617; Ore
gon with 2,501; Montana with 2,441;
Idaho with 1,291; the next state had
only 393; five states had one each,
and ten states had none.
According to the statistics recent
ly compiled at Tokio there were in
December, 1906, 59,100 Japanese
subjects in the United States and out
of that total no less than 53 per cent,
were in California and neighboring
states. It is in agriculture alone that
anything like signal success has been
attained. There are 14,000 Japan
ese farmers in California, and they
own an aggregate of 102,000 acres,
devoted mainly to the cultivation of
fruits and vegetables. An important
feature is their contribution to trade
with Japan, but much more remark
able are the sums remitted by them
to the home country. In 1904 they
sent to Japan $3,750,000, in 1905
nearly $5,000,000 and in 1906. $5,-
633,000. Nothing is said here about
Hawaii, so we may presume the Jap
anese population is growing on the
Continent.
The acting consul-general of Japan
at New York furnishes the papers of
that city with the statement that the
Japanese are moving homeward.
During the month of April 2 6 first
class and 17 second-class cabin and
210 steerage passengers returned to
Japan; 25 first-class and 3 6 second
class and 133 steerage passengers en
tered the United States. For the
same period one first-class and 368
steerage passengers returned to Jap
an from Hawaii, three first-class and
72 steerage passengers entered Ha
waii. Thus it is apparent that dur
ing this period 59 more Japanese re
turned home than entered the main
land of the United States, and 195
more returned home than entered
Hawaii. The largest proportion of
these were of the working class, as
shown by their mode of travel.—Ma
con Telegraph.
