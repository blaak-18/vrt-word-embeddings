THE ONLY WAY OF ESCAPE
HEN you were not looking, the
two old Trust Twins changed
your militia system. The new
name is the National Guard,
W
and the President will soon have the
power “to call out,” which the Gov
ernors had for a hundred years.
You see the object, don’t you?
As The Jeffersonian has tolvx you, the
President (after January next) will
be authorized to march New England
troops to Atlanta (the band playing,
“Marching Through Georgia’”) and
they will have the pleasure of in
dulging their hatred of us by shoot
ing us down in some collision be
tween us and the negroes—such as
that w r hich we had when Messrs.
Scott and Brand, of the Georgia Rail
road, were making their gallant stand
for the coons against the Caucasians.
In like manner, the President will
be empowered to order Georgia
troops to quell Northern workmen in
Pennsylvania and New England, and
our people will have the pleasure of
making the Yankees learn how it
feels to be shot down and crowed
over.
Oh, the Trusts know how to play
the game. They’ve got you tied,
hard and fast. They can now play
one section against another —the
„East against the West, the North
against the South, and vice versa.
Not only that, the new system admits
of the negro being used against the
white, the country against the city,
the Catholic against the Protestant,
the conservative against the Socialist,
and vice versa.
Brother Brand Again
Dear Brother Watson: —Inasmuch
as your reply to my letter in the
weekly Jeffersonian of September 30
contains some erroneous statements,
I feel constrained to reply to same.
I am a recent convert to Social
ism—particularly on the land ques
tion. My idea is just this: The title
to all lands should have forever been
held by the national government, and
a life tenure granted to every man
enough land to support his family
and no more. The individual to pay
a small yearly rental —not thirty per
cent., as renters are now compelled
to pay.
This plan would have eliminated
land speculation, which, I repeat, is
the crowning trust in this country
today. You scout the idea of a land
trust or monopoly, and yet more than
seventy per cent, of Texas farmers
are renters, and pay something like
thirty per cent, of all their earnings
to some other man for the right to
live upon the earth which a just

Isn’t it something fearful to con
template? The Governors will be
powerless. They will have to look on
helplessly as Federal troops from a
hostile section back up the usurpa
tions and nullifications of the lower
Federal judges!
Where were your “statesmen”
when this prodigious stride in cen
tralism was taken? Why did none
of the editors of the city dailies
arouse democracy to its danger?
That, same law was fought and
thrown out of Congress by me in
1892, but the snake was only scotch
ed, not killed. When it crawled
back, under a new name, some years
later, I was down and out, with no
way of reaching the public ear, and
had no confidence that anything com
ing from me would do any good.
But let me tell you how you can
yet defeat this conspiracy bf the
Trusts against democracy:
Don’t organize under the new Fed
eral law. Don’t join the National
Guard. Don’t give the Federal law
any material to operate on. Just
stick to your old State militia and
State law. In that way, and in no
other, your Governors will keep con
trol of the calling out of the State
troops.
You need not expect Congress to
repeal the fatal law which national
izes your State militia. The Trusts
have Taft, the Cabinet and Congress
in the hollow of their hands. Any
body can see that. T. E. W.
God created for the free use of every
man and beast.
Again, a single firm of New York
bankers own five hundred thousand
acres in western Texas, which of
course deprives other men of the use
of said lands, and yet you fail to
see anything like a land trust, al
though the same thing is going on in
your own State. In Georgia the per
centage of renters is even greater
than in Texas.
The land plank of the Populist
platform declares land to be “the sa
cred heritage of all the people,” but
land sharks have cheated seventy
per cent, of all the people out of their
birthright. Your platform also op
poses the alien ownership of land, but
I could be quite as happy while rent
ing land from an English landlord
as I could in renting from my home
merchant, the terms of rental being
equal.
You point to what Wayland does
in land speculation. As to that, Ido
not know; but we should not try to
justify our wrong-doing by point
ing to the other fellow.
Brother Watson, if you actually
have farms “lying out” in your State
which are offered free to actual set
tlers (no thirty per cent, wanted),
please advise me at once, and I will
undertake to colonize a few Texas
renters on them.
You point to the fact that private
ownership of land began in the ear
liest ages of history. The same can
be said of murder and other crimes,
but I would not undertake to justify
them on the score of age alone.
You use the phrase, “personal in
centive.” Now, I have heard that
speech used by old partyites in try
ing to justify legalized robbery until
it gives me that “tired feeling” de
scribed in the almanac.
A man who would not improve a
farm on which he could remain
during life would not improve it
even if he owned it.
Please locate the “hundreds of mil
lions of acres” open to settlers. Tex
as has several millions of acres of
semi-arid land, where man could not
possibly earn a support for his fami
ly, but the farm lands were all gob
bled up long ago. If farm lands are
so “free and eary,” as you claim, why
has the price doubled and often
trebled in the past ten years?
Brother Watson, I do not blame
you or any other man for owning
large bodies of land; but I do blame
the system of government which al
lows such a practice. You say, “Land
ownership is not unlimited.” Please
point out what the limit of owner
ship is, then, as I have never yet
been told.
No I would not, if I could do so,
f
take a single dollar from any man
without giving a full equivalent in
return.
The immortal Jefferson said, “All
men are created equal, with certain
Inalienable rights,” etc. Why do
you not accuse him of preaching “ne
gro equality?” You have been
preaching the doctrine of “a common
brotherhood among men” for years,
but I am not mean enough to say that
you meant social equality between
whites and negroes.
Finally, you say, “There’s nothing
wrong with our government, it is
perhaps the best man ever devised.”
Then tell us what you have been
“howling” about all these years? Is
it only to create a disgruntled ele
ment who will pay for and read your
publications?
The percentage of renters grows
larger year after year, farm lands
rise higher in price and get farther
and farther away from the poor man.
The first land that you bought is,
perhaps, worth ten times the price
you paid for it.
Is it right, is it just, to make men,
simply because they are poor, pay an
average yearly interest of thirty per
cent, on all their earnings in order
to have a shelter for their families?
While a man could buy and pay
for land thirty years ago, the time
when he can do so is almost passed.
This fact is attested by the great
number who buy land, make a pay
ment or two, only to lose the land
and also the amounts paid on it in
the end.

Reply.
Brother Brand alludes to that
“tired feeling.” Well, I have it my
self, occasionally.
When a correspondent refuses to
see the difference between a system
and the abuses which have crept into
it the ease is somewhat fatiguing.
The old Greenbackers, Knights of La
bor, and Populists made no attack
ppon our republican form of govern
ment. The attack was made on the
abuses, the class - legislation which
were transforming our equal-rights
republic into a special-privilege plu
tocracy. Our government, prior to
she Civil War, recognized State’s
rights, practiced economy, and re
sisted New England’s clamor for
confiscatory laws. The empire of the
corporations had not been establish
ed. Inferior Federal judges did not
sieze the government of the States
within which they hold jurisdiction.
There was no system of national
banks. There were no title-mad
heiresses, prodigal tourists, and mis
sion cranks draining off our national
resources into foreign countries. The
people did not have to pay a handful
of manufacturers two or three prices
for almost everything that they were
compelled to buy. Consequently,
there were no paupers. In Australia,
at the present time, they are in about
the same state that was ours, before
the War. They have very few large
fortunes and they have very few des
titute p’eople.
In making historical studies, I
have been impressed by the frequen
cy with which evidence is found to
the effect that we, as a nation, had
no “poor” in those days.
But any old Peter Cooper man
could explain easily and unanswera
bly how a change of the laws worked
a change on the people.
The statesman can tell you what
is the condition of any country, if
you will show him the laws of that
country. When Congress favors one
