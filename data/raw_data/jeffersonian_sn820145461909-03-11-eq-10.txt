CAPTAIN JACK CRAWFORD
(Continued from Page Three.)
But always'keep rememberin’ when
cares your path enshroud,
That God has lots of sunshihe to spill
behind the cloud.
Captain Crawford is one of the
most unique and delightful entertain
ers of the present time. Poetry, pa
triotism, history, wit and religion are
all blended in what he modestly calls,
. a medley of frontier experiences in
terspersed with his verse and once in
a while a bit of song. His entertain
ments possess a charm that wins 'his
audience, whether he addresses a hall
full of boys or the leading spirits at
the nation’s capital. Elbert Hubbard,
who is himself a brilliant writer, an
original thinker and one of the most
captivating and forceful speakers on
the American platform, says of him:
44 Jack Crawford is an orator, a poet,
a. man; and I’ll go you a Stetson
against a stogie that Harvard, Yale,
Columbia and Princeton have not a
man on their roster who can hold an
audience of 2,000 people for two
hours and not have a person leave or
want to leave. Captain Jack can do
it, and moreover can adapt himself to
any kind of an audience, from Chicago
newsboys to a parliament of religions.
The man is a marvel of manly
strength, fluid intelligence, flowing wit
and oratorical grace.
“Who taught Captain Jack to throw’
the lariat of his imagination over us
and rope us hand and foot and put his
brand upon us? Yes, that is what I
mean —who educated 'him? God edu
cated 'him.”
Casual acquaintances sometimes are
surprised that Captain Craw’ford is
such an advocate of teetotalism. But
the reason is not far to seek. His
father’s intemperance deprived him
of even the rudiments of an education,
and when his mother died he gave her
a solemn promise never to touch a
drop of liquor. How faithfully he
'has his word to her everybody
who knows him is aware. She knew
his wild nature, and realized better
than he could what a temptation drink
might become to him. And he con
siders that he owes all that he has
accomplished in life to that sacred
promise.
Captain Crawford’s temperance
principles are so well known that he is
not often asked to drink. But one in
stance is recorded, when he offered a
toast which all women should read.
It was at a-banquet in Boston when
one of the young ladies passed a glass
across the table with the request that
he “drink a toast to the ladies.” The
poet scout’s hand and voice trembled
as he took the glass from the jeweled
hand, but looking into the laughing
eyes of the girl he said:
“Miss, this a difficult task
you have given me, but a soldier’s
duty is first to obey orders —and I
shall try to drink a toast to woman —
not in that, 'however, which may bring
her husband reeling home to abuse
where he should love and cherish —
send her sons to drunkard’s graves,
and perhaps, her daughters to lives of
shame. No, not in that, but rather
in God’s life-giving water, pure as her
chastity, clear as her intuitions, bright
as Jier smile, sparkling as the laughter
of her eyes, strong and sustaining as
her love. In the crystal water I will
drink to her, that she may remain
queen regnant in the empire she has
01)4 3effersonlan
already won, grounded as the universe
in love, built up and enthroned in the
homes and hearts of the world. I
will drink to her, the full blown
flower of creation’s morning, of which
man is but the bud and blossom to her,
who in childhood clasps our little
hands and teaches us the first prayer
to the great All-Father; who comes
to us in youth with good counsel and
advice, and who when ©ur feet go
down into the dark shadows, smooths
the pillow of death as none other can;
to her w’ho is the flower of flowers, the
pearl of pearls. God’s last but God’s
best gift to man —woman, peerless,
jfure, sweet, royal woman; I drink
your health in God’s own beverage—
cold, sparkling water.”
Captain Jack Crawford possesses a
striking personality. He is a big fel
low with iron gray moustache and long
hair flowing over his shoulders. The
long hair was originally worn for its
effect on the Indians, who believe that
a man who is fighting and cuts his
hair is a coward. He is a Scotchman,
born on Irish soil. He was brought
to America when a child, but com
pelled by poverty to work in the mines
of Pennsylvania, where the family had
settled.
But the war broke out and his fath
er enlisted, for, notwithstanding his
drinking habits, he wrns a born soldier
and he fought bravely and gave his
life for his adopted country. The
spirit of the father was strong in the
boy and he ran away and enlisted in
the same company. Twice wounded
in heavy battles, he received his first
in hospitals, from the sis
ters of charity, who nursed him back
to health.
After the war he returned to Penn
sylvania, where he again worked in
the mines until his mother’s death.
Finally he drifted westward and even
tually entered the service of the gov
ernment. He was captain of the
Black Hills Rangers and served as a
scout during the Sioux campaign.—By
a woman who has known Captain
Crawford twenty years.
