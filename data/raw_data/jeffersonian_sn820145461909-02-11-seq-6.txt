ZEZTERY T'HOTI THE PEOPLE
EFFORTS OF MR. WATSON PART
LY RESPONSIBLE FOR BRY
AN’S DEFEAT.
Dear Sir: You will please discon
tinue my subscription to the Maga
zine, as I have no longer any interest
in politics, and care but little who
is president, now that the country is
rid of the one who has in my opinion
forfeited the respect of every level
headed citizen.
Besides, I regard the efforts of Mr.
Watson as responsible for the defeat
of Mr. Bryan, who was the only man
that could hope to wrest the Govern
ment from the control of what I be
lieve to be the worst party that ever
existed in any civilized country on
the face of the earth.

WILLING TO START REORGANI
ZATION MOVEMENT WITH
LIBERAL SUBSCRIPTION.
You said before the last election
that you would call a national confer
ence of the People’s Party after the
election, and asked the members of
the party to say what they thought of
it.
I have been looking for the call,
but have not seen it up to this time.
As a member enlisted for life for the
principles, I think the conference
ought to be called, and by February
22, 1909. Later than that will be too
late for the farmers this year, and that
is where the most of our votes come
from. St. Louis or Oklahoma City
ought to be the place for it.
It seems to me that we should be
able to organize every state in the
Union by next November by putting
an efficient organizer out in '"every
state, he to organize every county, and
every county to organize every town
ship. In order to do this in Missouri,
1 will give ten dollars, and if 99 more
will give the same amount it will or
ganize Missouri. I believe there can
be found 100 people who will give the
amount, for I know that there are
more than that number that are able
to do so.
It seems to me that the present ten
dency of affairs is sufficient to move
every Populist to action, for under
the present conditions we can not get
the votes we cast counted. I have
been in possession of the fact that I
received fifty votes more than were
counted to my credit in this city. I
do not suppose that I have seen half
of the number of men who voted for
me for Secretary of State. In the
contest going on in St. Louis between
the candidates for Lieutenant Govern
or, between the two old parties, I see
that the same thing was perpetrated
on the Socialist candidate by counting
his vote for the other two candidates
of the old parties. They have been
doing this all the time, is my opinion.
If this will not arouse us, I fail to see
what will. They even tried to keep
me from voting the People’s Party
ticket at the primry election; refused
to give me a ticket, telling me that
they didn’t have it, that the contest
was between the two old parties.
Let these sets be one of the
means of reconsecrating our lives to
the principles that we were taught by
Jefferson, Jackson and Lincoln to be
lieve are right.
I send you two dollars for the Mag
azine and Weekly Jeffersonian, to be
continued to my address.

FROM ONE OF THE ’‘OLD
GUARD.”
Meisler, Texas.
1 am <Bl years old, was born in
North Carolina, moved to Alabama in
1845 and then moved to Texas in 1876.
I served three years in the Confeder
ate Army, and am yet fighting corrup
tion in low and high places, boll wee
vil in the plantation, and boll weevil
in commerce. When it comes to only
making one bale of cotton on from 5
to 10 acres oft land, and sometimes 16,
I sometimes feel like I would like to
write to seme or all of the papers
that I take. I take the Jeffersonian,
thc**National Co-operator, the Galves
ton News, and Bryan’s Commoner.
Funny, is it not, that a man will vote
against a man every time he runs for
President and yet take and read his
paper? Time has been that I would
have liked to venture an opinion upon
a man of that stripe, but I am too old
now. J. D. Baker.
SEVENTY-TWO BUT NOT WHIP
PED YET.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson:
After the battle is over and smoke
cleared away and dead counted, there
is one missing and he is from Nebras
ka, and the Peerless one at that. Where
is he and what will he jump to next ?
Don’t know. Our ballots were thrown
out in many places. Here they would
give no account of them. All right;
I am proud of our vote any way and
of our leaders. God bless them! I
am not whipped yet. People will get
their eyes open after awhile, and say,
“On with the fight till the last ditch
is crossed. ’ ’
Your suggestion about a conference
suits me all right. It is a good idea,
and after that conference if a new
name is proposed, I would suggest it
be called the JEFFERSONIAN DEM
OCRAT PARTY. I keep my re
form papers all out among my friends.
My age keps me from doing much —
72 and almost blind, but my heart is
in the cause to stay.
Ever your friend in the cause of re
form. J. 8. Jones.

A THOROUGH MISSIONARY.
Madisonville, Ky.
Dear Mr. Watson: Accept my con
gratulations vou have made for the
much needed reform at so great a sac
rifice on your part. I am a constant
reader of your valuable paper, The
Jeffersonian, and would be at a great
loss without it. I am going to try
to get as many subscribers as I can
as soon as I have a little time. I have
been sending my paper out to others
as soon as I read it and I am going
to call on those parties and get them
to subscribe. I note that my time ex
pires and I will send in my renewal.
May God and the people help you
in the reform work. I am an old
tSfce Jeffersonian
green-backer. Don’t intend to give
up hope. Yours in the cause,
J. A. Davenport.
A PLEA FOR CONSTITUTIONAL
MONEY.
Hucal, Texas, Jan. 23, 1909.
Thomas E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Please find enclosed copy
of a letter that J wrote to our repre
sentative in Congress. If you think
it worth the space in your weekly, you
may publish it. Yours,
F. 8. Taylor.
Hucal, Texas, Jan. 4, 1909.
The Hon. O. W. Gillespie, Washing
ton, D. C.
Dear Sir: Pardon me for again
writing you touching the financial con
dition of this nation. Roosevelt has
recommended a revision of the mone
tary laws, and it seems to me to be a
most appropriate time for you to
make a record in defense of govern
ment money, —the money of the con
stitution, the money for the masses,
and not the classes. It is time for
our Representatives to rise in their
might and condemn the robber bank
ing system, stop the issuing of bonds,
and all other methods of robbing the
people under the guise of law. If
government bonds are good, govern
ment money is better.
I realize that you are aware of the
fact that this nation can not stand
long under such a financial system as
it is under now. There may be some
thing more infamous than the Aid
rich bill as passed by the last Con
gress, but it is hard to think of. We
will eagerly wait for the next move on
the money question.
Respectfuly yours,
F. S. Taylor,
Viee-Pres. U. S. Monetary League.
“MAN’S DUTY TO MANKIND.”
Melmore, 0., Jan. 25, 1909.
As we are entering upon the duties
of another year, we can not forget
that in addition to personal and home
affairs, we have social and civic du
ties. To qualify us for the discharge
of these duties, we must understand
the relations of each social, commer
cial and political factor to every oth
er factor. To secure a “square deal”
between them, not only intelligence,
but eternal vigilance, is imperative.
This is the lesson of all human expe
rience in all history,—the tendency
of the strong to oppress and enslave
the weak is a fact beyond question.
Hence, now, as in the past, lust for
power leads to unholy methods and
combinations to secure it.
No more diabolical pretense was
ever set up for enslaving men and wo
men than this: “It is necessary for
the salvation of souls and the glory of
God.” All honor to the faithful
watchmen —Watson* and Wayland—
for exposing the unholy alliance be
tween Rome and Washington. But
king-craft and priest-craft have ever
had a common object,—the industrial
enslavement of mankind. The Frank
lins and the Jeffersons thought to in
augurate a new era —an era of free
dom. But, alas! instead of crowned
kings and titled aristocrats, an aristoc
racy of wealth with 11 the divine rights
of property” (however acquired) for
its slogan, sit complacently iff the
seats of government.
God pity a people inheriting liberty
and equality of opportunity who suf
fer deceitful Delilahs to soothe them
to sleep, while stealing their birth
right.
The jumping-jack at the White
House, facing about so fast as to ac
complish no reform, will soon vacate
and hie him to “darkest Africa”—
perhaps to “spy out the land” and
eventually make use of our battle
ships to hold possession. Who shall
fix a limit to this “World Power”
craze ?
It is a grand work, Bro. Watson,
in which you are engaged in exposing
the follies and crimes of our economic
systems, and better still pointing out
a “more excellent way.” Not a mere
fault-finder, but a practical reformer
and statesman I bid you God speed.
John Seitz.
“DEMOCRATS FEEDING TAFT
WITH TAFFY.”
It is with much pleasure that I am
permitted to drop you a few lines on
this my birthday. This date, Jan.
26th, brings me up to the 78th mile
post. I can do nothing that will give
me more pleasure thant ot alk to you a
little while on paper, as I have lost
all hopes of seeing your face in the
flesh, but I hope to see you in a better
world.
I see the Georgia people have been
feeding Mr. Taft on taffy, in big
chunks at that, and the Democrats
took no back seats either. It seems
that our Southern people have lost all
self respect. Take the masses today,
and they are all things to all men.
Well, I stood in the middle of the
road and saw Bryan’s last brigade
go by all tattered and torn, and his
rear guard of negroes with Bishop
Turner in the lead. It was truly a
sight for an American to look upon.
Please let me know if the reform
forces are doing anything more than
talking. I am so anxious to see some
thing done. I will send you some
subscribers soon. Everything is at a
standstill as far as the farmers are
concerned. Those that can hold their
cotton are holding it and not buying
anything, and they say they can see
no encouragement as to a higher price.
I think that is a good idea of yours
to employ Sully to bull the price.
You are at liberty to publish any
part of this you see fit.
J. P. Alexander.

I have been with and for you 18
years, and see no change in you. Am

you deviate from your own teaching.
It was through our friend and neigh

ever lived, who edits the Hannonizer

your paper.
