abides in Wolfville, I was pesterin'
'round Vegas with Bill Lockridge, who
was workin' a small bunch of '7-bar-k'

been slashin' 'round the Plaza all day,
findin' fault with the whisky an'
amoosin' ourselves at our own ex

is some free an' various an' liable to
mix him into trouble. Not that Bill is
bad; none whatever, but bein' seven or
eight drinks ahead of that Plaza
whisky makes him feel gregar'ous and
friendly, an' he's cap'ble of goin' about
a-elaimin' of acquaintance with peo
ple he don't know at all, an' foelin'
'way hostile when the stranger has
symptoms of doubt.
"*So I goes along; Bill a-warblin'

that's all All at once, while we're
prowlin' up one of them spacious al

comes up on a I-talian with an organ
which he is grindin'. This yore organ
ain't so bad an' I've heerd a heap worse
strains. As soon as Bill sees him he
tries to figger on a dance, but no one'll
dance with him.
"'*In which event,' says Lockridge, 'I
plays a lone hand.'
"So Bill puts up a small dance, like
a Navajo, accompanin' of himse'f with

'Gimme the music for a Kreen corn

"'This yore man can't play no green

" 'He can't, can't he?' says Bill,
mighty scornful. 'Wat till he taries. I
know this man of yore I meets him
two years ago in Drunee's, an' me an'
him has quite a time.'
" 'Whatever is his name then?' I asks.
"'Antonio Marino,' says the dag

" 'I aeer see you,' says the dago.
" 'Yes, you did,' says BilL 'You jest

"But the I-talian insists he never sees

"'Thls yere's good enough for a

organ. 'Where WMerino? Whatever is
the matter with him? Why didn't he
stand his hand?'
"But Merino ain't here no more, so
Bill allows it's a shame to lot it go that
way, an' Mexicans sufferin' for musie.
So he strape on the tune-box and goes
round from one 'doby to another
a-turnin' of It loose.
" 'How long did this yere Merino
turn out his tunes,' says Bill, 'before
he collects? However, I makes new
rools for the game right yere. I plays
these cadences for five minutes anad
then I gIte action on 'em for five. I

"So Bill twists away for five minutes
an' me a-timin' of him, an' then leans

to colleetin'. He'd go up to some
household a-whirlin' his gun like&

him the members gets that generous
they even attempts to negotiate loans
and give 'em to Bill, they're that am

"One time he runs up on a band of
towerists, who was sorter trackin'
'round an' lookin' .t things, and they
comes up an' listens awhile. They was
turnin' to go away jest before collect

" 'Hold on,' says Bill, pickin' up his

but you bet you can't jump no game of
mine that way. So jest you all line up
agin' the wall until I tucks the blank

I'm workin on, an' I'll be with you.'
"So when Bill winds up he goes
along the line of them tremblin' tower
ists an' collects eleven dollars.
" 'They was aimin' to git away with
all them nocturnes an' peggios, an'
arias, an' not say nothin',' says Bill,

'but they can come no twist like that
an' me a ridin' herd. Nono what

"Bill carries on this away for three
hours; and what on splits an' what on
bets he win, he's over a hundred dol
lars ahead. But at last he's tired, an'
allows he'll quit and call it a day. So
he lugs the old tom-tom down to
Franklin's ofice. Franklin is marshal,
an' Bill turns over the organ an' the
money, an' tells Franklin to hunt up
Merino an' give him the whole shootin'
match.
" 'Where is this yere dago?" says
Franklin.
" 'However do I know'' says Bill.
'Last I sees him he was a-goin' up the
oalle like a jack rabbit.'
"Just then Merino comes in view
feelin' some pensive and fearful about
that bullet in his organ; but when he
gets Bill's donation his feelin's com
mences to rise a lot. In fact, he be
gins to regard it as quite a scheme.
" 'But you'll have to round up to the
alcalde, Bill,' says Franklin, 'I ain't
shore none you ain't been breakin'
some law.'
"Bill grumbles an' allows Vegas is
gettin' a heap too reserved for him.
" 'It's gettin' so,' says Bill, 'a free
American citizen don't get no en
couragement. Here I puts in half a
day amassin' wealth for a dago ys is
sittin' in bad luck; an' elevatin' Mexi

am layed for by the marshal like a

"Well, we all goes over to Steele's'
Franklin an' Bill and old Steele, the
alcalide, goes pokin' about to tee what
ever crimes Bill's done anyhow. They

up the towwrists didn't worry 'em none,
but the question of the music ites'f

" 'I'm shorely sorry to say it, Bill,'
says Steele, 'but you've been m-bustin'
of a ord'nance about playin' music on
the streets without no license.'
" 'Can't you beat the game no way?'
says Bill.
" 'I shorely don't see how,' says
Steele.
" 'Mi tamblen,' says Franklin.
" 'Whatever is the matter with tack

OUT OF THE RUT.
rae sarag"e ate 1aeesesatl bspsrtare of
a se$shesa isatmer.
A young farmer in the southwest,
having come into posseselon of t small
plantation through the death of his
father. determined to introduce some
radical changes. The farm had not
been profitable for several years. His
father had borrowed money of mer
ehants and put every scre into cotton,
.buying his food supplies every year
and running every year more deeply
into debt. Thie son was anxious, as be
said, "to get out of the rut."
He decided to abandon cotton-plant
ing, and to raise strawberries and oth
er fruit on a large scale, and, so far as
possible, to make a living from his
farm by producing his own food sup
plies. He began with a few seres of
strawberries, and put the remainder of
his land in corn, oats, grass, potatoes
and vegetables, increasing his supply
of poultry and pork.
All his neighbors remonstrated with
him. A southern plantm.ethey said,
?rho did not raise cotton, but who de
voted his energies to small fruit and
"trucking," would be of no account
socially, while inviting financial ruin.
The young farmer was warned that in
breaking away from the customs and
traditions of the cotton belt he was
lowering his dignity and degrading
himself to the level of "the poor white
trash."
One critic was even more outspoken.
He was the father of the young woman
whom the young farmer had been
courting, and who was engaged to him.
"You are acting like a lunatic!"
growled this veteran. "What can you
do without a cash crop like cotton?
Where can you find a market for your
strawberries? You are as mad as a
March hare!"
"The finest varlelies of berries will
grow here to perfection. I can make
arrangements to send them by rail
north, where I shall be ahead of the
season, and also south for the latest
varieties when the home crop is ex
hausted. As for cotton, it is impover
ishing the planters here, as you well
know. Why should I raise cotton
without profit for the sake of what you
call social prestige?"
"Well, sir," was the angry reply, "if
you are bent upon going on with your
crazy schemes, you shall not drag
down my daughter with you. She is
a cotton planter's daughter, and shall
not be a truck farmer's ;rife."
As the daughter sided with the
father, the engagement was broken
off. The young man, undismayed by
the disapproval of his neighbors, car
ried out his plans with resolute deter
mination. The experiment was suc
cessful.
He was obliged to be patient as well
as determined, and the result was that
lie was soon obliged to double his
strawberry acreage. He then intro
duced raspberries as a crop to follow
the strawberries. The result has been
that he found his profits warranted
the purchase of another farm, and the
enlargement of his fruit business.
Meanwhile the planters around him
were many of them impoverished by
low prices for cotton. The veteran
who had called him a lunatic was re
duced to such straits that one or two
of his children went into the fruit
farmer's fields to pick strawberries in
their season for the wages they might
receive. Everyone now is convinced
that there was method in the young
planter's madness. - Youth's Com
panion.
NAPOLEON'S DREAM.
He Longed to Follow Ia the Footsteps of
Alexander the Great.
Bonaparte was a child of the Medi
terranean. The light of its sparkling
waters was ever in his eyes, and the
fascination of its ancient civilizations
was never absent from his dreams of
glory. His proclamations rang with
classic allusions, his festivals were
adorned with classic ceremony. In ina
fancy he had known of Genoa, the
tyrant of his island, as strong in
the splendid commercial enterprises
which stretched eastward through the
Levant, and beyond into the farther
orient; in childhood he had fed his
imagination on the histories of Alexan
der the Great, and his conquest of ori
ental empires; in youth he had thought
to find an open door for his ambition,
when all others seemed closed, by tak
ing service with England to share the
renown of those who were building up
her eastern empire. Disappointed in
this, he turned with the same lack of
success to Russia, already England's
rival on the continent of Asia.
It is perfectlg comprehensible that
throughout his early manhood his
mind should have occasionally revert
ed to the same ideals. The conqueror
of Italy and Austria might hope to
realise them. Was he not master of
the two great maritime common
wealths which had once shared all
eastern trade between them? En
gland's intrusion upon the Mediterra
nean basin was a never-ceasing irrita
tion to all the Latin -powers. Her
Scommercial prosperity and her mastery
of the seas aggravated the exaspera
tion of France, as threatening
even her equality in their an
ceient rivalry. From the days of the
first crusade all Frenchmen had felt
: that leadership in the reconstruction of
Asia belonged to them by virtue of
preoectlition. Ardent republicans.
