.. . PUBLIC OPINION
Reflected in the Papers of this
Great State.
Whatever might be said against
Senator McEnery for advocating
protection, he has never yet de
serted the Democratic party as did
the senior Senator in the last cam
paign. It was well known that the
election of McKinley and his con
trol of Congress meant the speedy
enactment of high tariff la-vs, and
yet Mr. Caffery did all in his power
to make that result possible, while
Senator McEnery took the stump in
support of the candidate and plat
form of his patty. Those who wish
to forgive and forget this break of
allegiance on the part of Mr. Caf
frey, because forsooth, he is now
against the tariff measure of the
party he assisted in electing, can do
so, but as between the two senators
'we will have a greater admiration
for S. D. McEnery. - Catahoula
News, Dem.
Some gushing admirer or toady
of McKinley speaks for his '"iron
will." That is the height of irony.
-Daily States, Dem.
Senator McEnery stated to a sub
committee of the Finance Commit
tee of the Senate the other day that
he favored protection for all the in
dustries, including a tariff on wool,
and that he had been a protection
ist for a long time. This announce
ment of the senator was news to his
political admirers in Louisiana, for
it contradicts his professions fcr
the past twenty years. It has al
ways been held that he was a Demo
crat in every sense of the word, but
he is not in line with his party on
the protection idea. - Mansfield
Journal, Dem.
When Senator S. I). McEnery
lends his support to the I)ingley
tariff bill and declares himself a
protectionist, he parts company
with his Democratic constituents
and disregards the first and founda
tion principle of the party, in which
the -has so long been enlisted. -
Houma Clipper, Dem.
The new tariff bill is )et hanging
fire in the Senate committee rooms.
The Democratic members are
throwing every obsticle they can in
the way of its passage and the peo
ple of the country will hold them
responsible f 'r the delay.-Frank
lin Vindicator, Rep.
It is only a question of time till
the South becomes as strong an
advocate of a protective tariff, as
she is now of free trade. Condi
tions will soon be reversed as re
gards the standing of the East and
the South, upon these questions.
Franklin Vindicator, Rep.
Senator S. D. McEnery's name is
being very liberally used by his
staunch Democratic friends in
North Louisiana in connection with
the Dingley tariff bill. It is af
firmed that he will vote for it. He
has not so asserted. The Times
does not believe that Senator Mc
Enery will sanction such a robber
enactment, much less strike the
-Democratic party of Louisiana such
a cruel blow in the face. His
fealty to principle has been phe
nomenal. It would astound his
loyal adherents to find him
sanctioning such an undemocratic
Republican measure as the Dingley
tariff bill.-Shreveport Times, Dem.
Blind though he is, there is noth
ing in the way of current events
that escapes the venerable chap
lain of the United States Senate.
He knows the contents of the
morning papers by heart. When
he comes to address the Throne of
Grace, in his morning invocation
with which the Senate is opened, it
always contains some reference to
the latest news. He is indeed a
wonderful man.-Shreveport Jour
nal, Dem.
Louisiana politics are peculiar,
for the Republicans are quarrelling
over spoils while the Democrats are
waiting to see which way the cat
will jump. The machinery of this
cat is wonderful and when the
proper time comes will round up
its kittens, who are inclined to
wander from the told. Populists,
beware of the paw of this old ma
chine pussy. The Populists of the
Congressional District held the bal
ance of power and voted for Mr.
Broussard and will give him all the
aid and comfort we can. For his
good deeds we will rejoice and over
his mistakes will lament.-People's
Party Department, Iberia Enter
prise.
It is not strange that the people
of the present day do not have the
respect for the decision of the
highest courts of the land which
they formerly had. Our State Su
preme Courts frequently decide the
most important cases by a majority
of one; and the Supreme Court of
the United States has twice, in the
recent past, decided cases of the
gravest interest and of the most far
reaching public importance by a
majority of only one; and in one in
stance-the income tax case--the
court sustained itself by one of the
judges changing his mind. Such
occurrences are not calculated to
increase the respect of the public
for our courts; and in the face of
such decisions it certainly cannot
be held that our highest courts are
above criticism.-Homer Guardian,
Dem.
The vote of Congressmen Brous
sard, Davey and Meyer, in favor of
the Dingley infamy, has been the
cause of much unfavorable com
ment by the Democratic press of
the State. And it is no wonder.
The Dingley bill is an infamous
measure, a robber tariff to enrich
the rich and grind down the poor;
a law apparently drafted in the
special interests of trusts and mon
opolies. It is indeed astonishing
that such Democrats as Senator
McEnery and Congressman Brous
sard should aid in saddling upon
the people such an undemocratic
measure. - St. Landry Clarion,
Dem.

High Water in Louisiana.
To The Lafayette Gasette:
The direful calamity that has threatened
the planters and those living along the
shores of the Mississippi river, seems to be
drawing' to a terrible crissis. The high
water of that great river has destroyed, and
is on the verge of destroying, vast acres of
cultivated land, the mainstay of the pros
perity in our State.
For many years the Mississippi river has
been a means of apprehension to our people,
and the government has tried to allay these
fears by putting up levees, that only serve
to increase and hasten the terrible catastroa
phy that they are striving to avoid"
I am no engineer, nor am 1 in search for
a polemic, but the present disaster that
threatens our State, causes all thinking men
to look deeper into the subject than mere
newspaper perusals; the great peril that is at
the very walls of New Orleans, the metrop
olis of our State, must hasten our actions, if
any steps are to be taken, and free our
minds from any prejudice. I, who place
myself among those whose interest lie only
in saving, from utter ruin, the most prosper
ous and beautiful part of Louisiana, do ven
ture an opinion upon that most important
question that holds the public mind to-day:
'Can the overflows of the Mississippi be
checked by an all-levee system ?
High levees are not a means of checking
the Mississippi from overflowing its banks.
We see, by the force of reason and cir~um
stances, the higher you raise the banks of
a river, the higher you raise its bed. To
prove this, we will only have to take into
consideration the friction of the river
against its banks, causing a deposit upon its
bottom.
What Iras these levees done to prevent
the water from breaking through or running
over them ? If we but count the number of
times the levees have been raised, at once
we know the number of times the river has
broken through or overran its banks.
High levees only serve to keep the sur
plus water within the river, and this it ac
cumulates until it overflows its banks or
otherwise seeks its natural relief in making
outlets or crevases, which cause utter ruin
to the places where such a calamity happens.
Now, why not avoid this inconvenience by
digging artificial outlets ?
Nature never destroys herself, is an
axiom that we should bear well in mind.
Nature in her great benevolence has pro
vided a means of counteracting the evils
wrought by her own hand. The frozen
earth in winter is made to bear fruit until
the sun in his beneficence shines forth and
prepares the ground to be tilled again, the
sun in turn pours his mighty rays upon our
fields, and the flowers of the earth seem to
shrink and wither away, when the heavens
open its fountains and the repeated rain
falls upon these sickly flowers and strength
ens and invigorates them again, while they
lift up their drooping heads, looking up to

their Preserver in grateful thanksgiving.
The human heart, the most active machine
which nature has provided us with, for the
carrying of the nutritive fluid through
our bodies, in some cases grows weak, and
again nature meets the deficiency by caus
ing an envelope, so to speak, to grow
around it and strengthen its actions again.
And so on could I quote innumerable ex
amples of nature's great work, but for the
space I will unnecessarily occupy. Now
nature did not go back on itself when it
took under its kind care, the Mississippi
river, but to throw off the surplus water
that the river receives, nature's great anti
dote is outlets. At present we have two of
the natural outlets of the Mississippi closed
up. Now nature's course has been stopped,
and now can we expect to ward off the
calamities that naturally follow when a
natural course has been obstructed by high
levees, the very antithesis.
In the pioneer days of this country,
stately forests covered nearly the entire
space now occupied by the United States.
These forests were means of preservation to
rivers, by k-eping large quantities of water
from them, by absorbing billions of gallons
of water from the freshets. Now, these
forests stand no more, the mighty oaks and
other trees that once rendered so much
service have fallen by the hand of man;
villages, towns and cities have been erected
in their stead, and water that they once
kept from our rivers, now falls into them
almost unobstructed.
Look at our position; the Mississippi re
ceives more water than it ought to and be
ing blocked up on all sides by hight levees
and not being able to run out at its mouth
on account of the back waves of the gulf,
can do nothing else than break its banks
and render thousands of human beings
homeless.
It is evident that the only means of stop
ping crevasses and any more scares from
high water is to open all the natural outlets
of the Mississippi, and on account of the
extra supply of water caused by the cutting
down of the forests, build artificial outlets,
or in other words canalize it in the northern
part of the State so as to carry the surplus
of waters of the Red river into the gulf by
the streams in the western part of our State.
Now these artificial outlets need not re
ceive the waters the year through, they can
be made to have locks which are closed or
opened according to circumstances.
This done, I think we will have finished
with all such experiments as high levees,
and will in the long run save our people and
our State a great deal of money.
