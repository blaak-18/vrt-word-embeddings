My soul was weary. My heart
fainted within me. I could not un
derstand. If God were good, why was
it so? My soul doubted, and my
heart was full of questionings.
In the great unequal, unending
struggle of Right against Wrong, why
was Wrong always triumphant? Why
was “Truth forever on the scaffold,
Wrong forever on the throne”? I
could not understand.
And the men who have given their
lives for the uplifting of their broth
er man, why is it that the world has
ever treated them as failures, and
killed them on the block, or tortured
the life out of them by its hatred and
neglect ?
All down the vista of the ages since
history’s dawn, I beheld them —the
men to whom the world owes its prog
ress, its liberty; the men who have
dared to oppose the established or
der of things and point to the Bet
ter Way; the men who have been
brave and fearless enough to stand
by principle even unto death; the men
who have championed the cause of
the weak against the strong —and the
story was ever one of suffering.
One, the Holy One, was crucified.
Some were beheaded, some met death
on the scaffold, some wasted away in
dismal dungeons, some sang their
songs and died in poverty and obscu
rity. Some have done their work
amid and delivered their message to
a people that misunderstood, despised,
rejected, and broke the Reformer’s
heart by its jealousy and indiffer
ence through the weary length of long
years. It was always so. The
thoughtless, selfish world has never
recognized its great men until they
wjere dead.
And again I could not understand.
Did not God care? If God were on
the side of Truth and Right, why did
not Right triumph? Why not give
the Proclaimers of Truth the sweets
of victory while they lived? Why
must these glorious, inspired ones
bear all the ridicule, all the reproach,
all the cruelty, all the weariness,
while the indifferent, the opportunists,
the slaves of puiblic opinion, reap all
the honor, all the ease, all the praise?
Are the truly great never to have any
reward? Is there no joy for them?
And then I knew that the power,
the privilege, to live for the Truth—
to die for it, if need be —is to the
brave, courageous heart its own re
ward. He who defends the Right
only after it has become popular and
easy to defend is* but a coward at the
best. He who is not a disciple, an
apostle of Truth for Truth’s sake,
without respect to the reward, is not
worthy. The brave, unconquerable
spirit of the martyr, the Reformer,
scorns to accept ease and position as
the price of surrendered principle.
The inspired Helper of Humanity
walks proudly, unfalteringly, everlast
ingly the path of Duty as he sees it,
no matter how hard, how cruel the
way, no matter how many bitter,
heart-crushing wounds. In no other
way could he be true —true to himself
and God. No other course would sat
isfy his soul. Nothing else would
Under The Vine and Tig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
bring him peace—peace within —peace
even in the midst of battle. Is not
his joy, after all, the highest joy?
And now, although I can not under
stand, I know that God does care,
and my heart is brave again!

NO SEX IN POLITICS.
In our generation women have
forced their way into almost every de
dartment of life. After you have let
them work in your factories, in your
fields and mines, in your bars and
workshops, in your gardens and post
offices and counting houses, after you
have let them practice medicine and
study law, it is too late to turn back,
or to refuse them the rights of their
new position. Those who object to
female suffrage, who say that wom
an’s sphere is the home, should have
kept her there. Too late to turn the
key on her now —she is not at home.
The fact is, that, important as is
the sex-division in some things, it
does not stretch across the whole of
life; sex has no meaning in politics
any more than in dinner parties.
Men and women pray in the same
church and dance to the same music.
Both sexes have far more in common
than they have points of difference.
Why should one sex be shut out of
the polling booth? Why is Florence
Nightingale’s opinion of the candi
date for her constituency less valua
ble than the chimney sweeper’s? We
suffragettes demand votes for wom
en. not because they are women, but
because they are fellow-citizens. It’s
nobody’s business to inquire what sex
a voter is, any more than what color
the voter’s hair is. Once get into
your head that the claim of women
rests not upon their petticoats but on
their purses, not upon their being
women, but on their being taxpayers,
not on their being our rivals, but on
their being our comrades, and you
will escape tangling yourself in a
whole network of fallacies. —By Is
rael Zangwill, in Texas Farmer.
HOW TO GET PLUMP.
The fat-producing foods are prin
cipally milk, cream, eggs, butter, olive
oil; the sweets —sugar, honey, sweet
desserts, jams, sweet fruits; the
starchy vegetables—potatoes, peas,
beans, corn, beets; wheat bread, rye,
cereals of all kinds, rice, sago, etc. Os
the fruits, peaches, grapes, bananas,
prunes and figs are especially recom
mended. The only foods cut out of a
thin person’s diet are the condi
ments —pickels, pepper, mustard, cur
ry, salt, etc.; the acids, including acid
fruits, the vinegar in salad dressing,
etc.; and the stimulants, tea and cof
fee. It must not be forgotten that
although the tissue-making foods,
such as meats, fish, etc., are not fat
producing, they are required for their
own especial functions. Some of the
green vegetables and fruits are not
fat-producing, but they are needed
for other purposes. The fat-produc
ing foods should be indulged in prin-
Jeffersonian
cipally, but not to the exclusion of
others. —Harper’s Bazar.
SAYINGS OF MRS. SOLOMON.
Translated by Helen-Rowland.
Lo, my daughter, hast thou met
a homely man who charmeth thee?
Then cleave unto him with all thy
might. For a Greek god conquereth
easily, but he with the face of 4 mud
pie and the legs of a piano pleaseth
only by taking great trouble, and he
hath a winning way. Yea, he under
standeth women.
He doeth the sympathetic - and run
neth thine errands. He studieth thy
taste in flowers and quoteth thy
speeches accurately. He remember
eth the necktie thou didst admire and
weareth it always.
He noteth the fine points of thy
dress and speaketh definitely concern
ing them, saying, “A pink ruff be
cometh thee and thine ear is of a fas
cinating cuteness.”
He consulteth thee tenderly con
cerning the soup whether it pleaseth
thee and passeth thee the salt solici
tously. He putteth sugar in thy wine
and the clams which thou despiseth
will he not offer thee.
He playeth the devoted with great
skill, vet he forceth not his attentions
upon thee. Behold how he wrappeth
thy boa about thee adoringly and gaz
eth at thee long and hard when thou
art supposed not to be looking. Yea,
he spreadeth down a mental cloak for
thee to walk upon, even as did Sir
Walter Raleigh in the time of Queen
Bess, and secretly thou knightest
him.
For 10, he hath had much practice.
He treateth every woman in this way.
And it shall come to pass that in time
this shall become a “habit,” and he
shall treat even his wife with some
little courtesy.
Then, consider, my daughter, how
other women shall envy you and
speak among themselves, saying:
“Beold this woman’s husband
listeneth when she talketh. Verily
he appeareth to hear her —even to see
her. And is it not wonderful?”

SURE TO ACCEPT.
If you’d have a girl pin her faith to
you,
A girl that’s worth the winning;
Just give her a diamond pin or two —
And watch her do the pinning.

The Rubicen was the small stream
separating ancient Italy from Cisal

been allotted to Caesar. When Caes

an armed force he passed beyond the
limits of his own province and legal

A LULLABY.
You go to sleep, young feller,
This ain’t no time of day
To set up straight and solemn,
An’ stare around that way.
Them moonbeams on the carpet
Ain’t nothin’ you can git,
Them’s just to show the angels
Has got their candles lit.
You want ’em? Well, tomorrow
I’ll git ’em if they kekep,
But now it’s nearly mornin’,
So you jus’ go to sleep.
No, sir! You can’t be hungry,
You needn’t jerk and fret,
I’m certain sure it wasn’t
An. hour sence you et.
There, now, I ketch you smilin’
You little rascal, shame!
To try to work your daddy ,
With such a low down game.
No, never mind explorin’,
You ain’t no call to creep;
You stop here an’ be quiet,
An’ try an’ go to sleep.
You see them stars out yonder?
Well, all o’ them is eyes
That belongs to little angels
’Way up there in the skies,
An’ all them little angels
Ain’t got a thing to do
But jus’ set up in heaven
An’ keep them eyes on you.
They’ll see your eyes wide open,
An’ starin’ when they peep
In through the window at you —
You better go to sleep.
I don’t know what you’re sayin’,
Your lingo’s Greek to me,
But you know what I tell you,
That’s easy fur to see; •
An’ I’m jus’ gettin’ tired
O’ rockin’ you all night,
An’ talkin’ while you listen,
A smilin’ with delight.
I got to work tomorrow,
An’ tain’t fur you to keep
Me up all night a-tryin’
To make you go to sleep.
There, there, don’t feel that way,
I jus’ soon do it! Gee!
I know there ain’t nobody
To love you ’ceptin’ me.
You set up all you want to,
You needn’t close an eye, >
Fur dad is mighty sorry
He made his baby cry,
You need your ma, poor feller,
But she’s a lyin’ deep
Beneath the trees out yonder—
There, there, now go to sleep.
