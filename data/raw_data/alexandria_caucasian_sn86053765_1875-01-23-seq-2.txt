In response to Ilm demand of flic
Senate for information as to inter
ference of the military i:i Louisia
na a flairs,U.S.Ciant, the would-be
Dictator, responds iua message of
nearly four columns of solid mat
ter and lie gives them a rehash of
.-ill the slamh rsaml base falsehoods
that have been ground out of the
Southern Outrage Miil for tho last
four years. As a State paper it is
exceedingly weak and as an argu
ment it is only a fair sample of what
lawyers call special pleading. lie
argues the case from tho itndicul
stand point and makes the most, he
can out of if for the radicals, with
out so much as intimating that
there is any excuse or arguments
on the other «de. lie says that
the Colfax a Hair was a horrible
butchery on tin* part of tho whites,
but he siippr«'. -ses any intimation
of tho fact that flie negroes had
gathered there two or three hun
died stroig, with arms in their
hands, with murder in their hearts
and with threats of the rape of
white women ami tho ex termina
tion of white children upon their
lips.
He says in just so many words
that the, killing of tho six while
radicals at Coushalta, winch we
have, never justified, was wholly
without cxeuso or provocation,
while it was actually tho ease that
the negroes had gathered therein
numbers tiiieatening to burn, kill
and rob and that (hey had actually
tired upon the white citizens, be
sides having announced their pur
pose of attacking a house when! the
yoilng people of the town and
neighborhood were having a. party,
with the expressed intent of mur
«Ici ing the men ami raping the wo

tually the fact, that nine out ot (un I

This is the caption of a «lander
" Christian Charity Exemplified. "
ous, HheiliotiK^nnd untruthful arti
clo ill the llapidcs Gazette ot last
week which demands some notice
at our hands in justice to Ilm com
munity from which we derive our
support. We were disposed at
first to pass over this malignant ti
radons we have done other slurs
and slanders from that source, in
contemptuous silence ; but the uni
mux of the wiiter is so apparent
and his petty hatred of all that is
decent shows itself so plainly that
we cannot refrain from telling him
of it.
We have good reason to know
that but few persons will see his
mendacious effort for to our knowl
edge; tiro <piirc:t ol printing paper
published his last two issues on
half sheets, making the total for
each week fin'ty <i(/lit jtapcrx, but
still this is no excuse for the pub
lication of slanders, to call tlmm no
harsher names, on a whole commu
nity noted for its hospitality and
"christian charity."
The burden of complaint of this
pitiful scribbler whose jaundiced
vision con jures up a mountain of in
hospitably ont ot a molehill of un
intentional neglect, is that the wife
of one of the soldiers iu camp in the
Court Mouse yard had or did under
go a certain tiial in a tent, at the
time the Annual Conference of tlm
Methodist Church was being held
in tlm Court room up stairs, and
with this for a text lie proceeds to
reail the Conference in particular
and the community in general a
moral lesson on Christian Charity.
Ii«- lashes himself into a fury of vir
tuous indignation and finally winds
up with a ^notation from the Scrip
tures which has us much applica
tion to tlm case as common sense
has to <lo with his own imbecility.
I'lio facts are that the. members
I Ilm matter
I'lio facts are that the. members
<>f the Conference knew no more of
than we did ; and had
they known ail about, it, they were
themselves strangers here, depend
ent upon the hospitality ot our ci t
izens and without the information
as to vacant houses that would have
enabled them to have rendered any
assistance had they known all about
the circumstances and been ever so
ready to have given the necessary
aid. On the other hand, Mr Vose,
the soldiers, has been here since
October, and has had both the op
portunity and ample time to have
made all tho necessary arrange
ments long iu advance of tho first
week iu January, at which time
there is a demand for houses for
tim whole year and a disinclination
on the part of landlords to rent.l
iiouses fora short time, for the very
obvious, reason that by renting for
oim month they might lose the
lease for the o'her eleven months.
We know to whom reference is
made as "one of the most promi
nent and wealthy members of the
Methodist Church," to whom ap
j plication was made "for a room in
oneot his vacant buildings" and as
we had but a few «lays before mov
ed our office out of t Im same build
ing we are thoroughly acquainted
with all the facts. The gentleman
referred to, refused to lease us the
whole, of the upper story of his
brick building for all of the next
year, much less "for a few days on
ly," because he had propositions to
rent the whole building ami he
could not, as a matter of course,
lose the rent of the whole to rent
llio upper story at a much smaller
price. "The "friend who interced
ed" has a very comfortable room
■that he might have given up "for
a, few days only" at much less risk
of loss than the owner of the build
ing would have incurred by renting
a portion of his large brick store
"for a few days only,'' when lie
might thereby have lost a lease ol
| it for the whole year.
The writer of this malicious arti
cle tor the indignant Gazette might
himself have taken an interest in
this matter and out of his abundant
charity have provided suitable
apartments for the accomrnonation
ot Mr. Vose and his family. As
even a vindictive Ishmaehtc, he is
a part, though a most unworthy
one, of this community and the ob
atiun was as binding upon him
as upon any other member thereof
to play the good Samaritan to this
traveller from Jerusalem to Jericho
"
who ha«l fallen among thieves, "one
of whom he is which."
So much for this vile slander.—
If Mr. Vose, had made his wants
known properly he would have
been provhled for. > o far from
there being any prejudice against
liini 011 account of the uniform ho
wore, the contrary is tho case.

D kak S ik :—In tho interest of the
country, I desire to ask if any deci
ded efforts lms yet been made to pro
cure means to enable Mr. It. Ii. Marr
to go to "Washington to represent
the Colfax enso.
If one thousand dollars has not
been raised, nome active canvassers
•»light to be at work without any de
lay. In view of recent events in this
State, it becomes more and more im
portant that Justice Bradley's viow
of the constitutionality of tho En
forcement. Act should bo maintained.
Almost the whole of tho Federal in
terference in the Southern States has
been under this Act, and must, if the
Act is pronounced unconstitutional,
at once cease. Our people will see
how essential it is to have this case
properly presented to tho Supreme
Court ; not only iu tho interest of
our friends who aro direct,Ij concern
ed, but also in the general interest of
the State of Louisiana, a S ..vreign,
throttled by what should have been
its servant.
Wo aro expecting Messrs. Hoar,
F rye and Vv"heeler, of tlm Congres
sional Committee this w< eh—nil rall
ied*. What their purpose is can on
ly be surmised. The Uadicals lu re
think that this part of the Commit
tee will arrange for a partisan coun
ter report. If the action of the Gov
ernment is lo he sustained by even
one fourth part of the American peo
ple a strong "bloody shirt" report
must, be had from some quarter.
Whatever may be their purport« we
shaT, if a'lowed, endeavor to gfti the
truth before them.
Our Legislature is still firm, but I
think they may adjourn this week.—
Rapides is ft mi if. against, compro
mise wit It the illegal and depraved
body at tiie State House. Nothing
short of being recognized rh the le
gal Legislature will be entert aine 1
by us. A minority no matter how
large, would be poWeiless fur good
in siicli a body as thin would be, and
there is no question in my mind us to
our duty. I am opposed to legali
j z '"o their infamous body but think
il bost ,u u at its bta
' ,u present bta
is
j
Ins—the whole affair from Governor
down being u more Bot <;f puppets
sustained alone by TJ. S. bayonets—
holding their places not by the will
of the people, but directly in opposi
tion to such will—such a blot upon
republican institutions cannot exist.
Wo are upon the ridge and must
slide off on the side of Centralization
and Imperialism, or else on the side
of Constitution and Slates Lights.—
I have no doubt as to the side, and
would say to our people, as Senator
Thnrman said to us the other day,
"be patient," very"hard advice to fol
low. Under all circumstance« we mux/
keep the pnblic peace—and trust
to God and the American people for
relief, at the same time, relaxing no
individual efforts in any possible di
rection. It will never do to give up
the ship.
I hope our colored friends and ad
herents may be in no respect discour
aged—wc mean thorn good, and the
day is not far distant when pcaco
and good-will shall pervade the land.
Yours truly,

WOMAN'S CSUSASS.
The crnBado against the bar-rooms
in the. West, seems to havo died out
entirely. A year ago every newspa
per and periodical teemed with enns
tio article« upon tho all-absorbing
topic. Even »ho Review of Keviews
the London Saturday deemed this
extraordinary episode in American
im», worthy a column. Like ofhel*
phases'of [fanaticism, it woro itself
out, and very quickly, though tho
evil which gave rise to anch an un
precedented measnre on the part of
.the women, must have indeed been
grave, and deep-rooted. Christiani
ty we aver, and believe has placed
woman on a more elevated pedestal
than any she occupied before its be
ricficent light shed its glory on the
world, and yet to-day, there are
many insfunees of^harsh, and cruel
treatment by chribtian husbands,
which rival tho brutality of tho sar*
age. Unfortunately, tho excessive
use of spirituous bquors i$ not con
fined to tho West. It covers the
length, and breadth of this laud.
Them are men, and naturally good
hearted men loo, who by habitual
drunkenness, entail upon therr fami
lies nil tho care, slid misery, and
poverty which must ensue when the
man,' who shonld be the head, and
sristainer of his family, actually sells
the bread out of their mouth to ob

comes a settled habit, and sho works,
and pinches, and atarves to keep her

This piclnro may appear over
drawn, but it is sadly true. I have
before mo two instances, (how many
more there may be in this very Par
ish God only knows) where u»«n well
to -do in ante helium days, now spend
every day of their lives loafing and
drinking in a country shop, while
their wives actually build fences,
plough, plant, drive up the cows, and
milk them, besides of course doing
their own cooking and washing.—
This, iu an enlightened ago, and
among Southern men, whoso boast
has always been, that they united
bravo, and gallant deeds, with chiv
alrous tenderness to the weaker sex
In saying thnfl, we would not have
it supposed that wo are advocating
helplessness, or luziness în a woman
—far from it—a wellJ;orga»ized wo
man has so much occupation in the
sphere ordained for her, in the sweet
duties of life, As daughter, sister,
wife and mother, that there is no
need for her to overstep the bounda
ry assigned to her, nnd appropriate
tho vocations that properly belong to
man. Nor do we wish her to be so
busied about her Kights, as to forget
her duties, in ssreaming for more
Liberty.
We never knew one of those who are
fur upsetting the Christian order of
man's precedence, who was not a rest
less discontented being und more un
happy than the timid shrinking wo
man whose nerves have been shat
tered by the loud voice, and midnight
orgies of a brutal husband, because
they are forgetful of the duty they
owe even a bad husband, and with
peevish discontent would invest
God 's order of things, and fancy they
can more rightly perform man's duty
than man himself.
"Those who rock tho cradle rule
the world." In roaring her children,
and keeping her "house in order,"
sho should remember that it is possi

that only twenty -Ave colored men voted
tho Conservative ticket. The meeting
was addressed in good, plain, sensible homo

RESOLUTIONS:
R ssolvsd, That this Meeting of Color
ed Conservative voters of this Parish de
nounce the action of the Returning Itourd
at New Orleans in falsifying tbe election
returns.and retarding the defeated candi
dates for the Legislature and Sheriff and
Coroner as elected, and we declare that ac
tion unjust and a violation of the will of
the people expressed at thé ballot-boxes.
üksoi.vki », That we personally declaro
there waa no intimidation attempted in
tbi* parish except the intimidation of
white voters by the V. S. Cavalry, and tho
Deputy Marshal from New Orleans.
UKSOl.vKD, Tbnt wo joined the white
people of this Parish at the late election in
their honest efiort to sccure good govern
nient and it was through us in part, that
the Conservative Candidates were elected
and we hereby sleclare that we intend and
are determined to continue to set with
them, as long as they are true to- their
promises to protect men of all color iu
their rigbte.
I y We had the pleasure of meet
ing in onr Sanctum last week, Mr.
Clifton It. Breckenridge, a son ol
Gen. John G. Breckenridge, who
visited our parish on business for
the honse of G. G. Glaiborne & Co.,
of New Ortafchs; of which hé is a
member. We were College mates
at Washington College, under tho
Presidency of Gen. Lee, and it
gave us great pleasure to meet Mr.
Breckeuridge again, and talk over
our College days. He is a worthy
son of a noble sire, and his short
stay alone prevented the extension
to him of numerous œurtesies that
were proposed as expressive of tho
esteem iu which his father is held
by onr people, as well as of his own
sterling qualities.
BP The Congressional Commit
tee is investigating tbe condition
of affairs of Louisiana, and numer*
ous special Committees are calling
upon our friend, Sara at the Jewel
to investigate the quality of his
liquors. They all report favorably.
