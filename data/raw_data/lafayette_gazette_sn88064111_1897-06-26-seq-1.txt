THE LAFAYETITE GAZETTE.
OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE PARISH AND TOWN OF LAFAYETTE.
VOL. V. LAFAYETTE, LA., SATURDAY, JUNE 26, 1897. NO. 17.
NPORMAL CLOSED.
The Peabody Summer Noranal
Holds Its Last Session.
The teachers are with us no
more.
They did their last day's work
Friday, adjourned at a2 o'clock
and left for their homes on the
afternoon trains.
No more will we see sweet school
marms promenading our streets
with text and note books. They
have done their work and gone
home better prepared to teach the
young idea how to shoot.
The sedate male pedagogue has
also bidden us good-bye. He is a
nice, pleasant fellow and we hope
he will come again. He too, has
worked hard and next session he
will be better equipped for the
school-room.
Those who believe that summer
normals accomplish no good, are
surely not aware of the work done
here during the past month.
The normal has been pre-emi
nently a brilliant success. All
helped to make it so. Acting
Institute Conductor A. L. Smith
worked with unremitting zeal, and
despite the excessive heat was ever
ready for business. He was ably
seconded by Profs. Keeny, Tru
deau and Miss Lewis and for a
short while by Miss Baer. It is
safe to say that every teacher has
received a new impetus. The in
struction has been exceptionably
practical and the teachers never
failed to show a proper interest in
the exercises. A very commenda
ble spirit made itself felt through
out the course.
At the closing session Friday,
P'rofs. Smith and Keeny paid a
high tribute to the personel of the
normal and expressed their pleasure
in having spent a month in Lafa
yette.
Before adjourning the teachers
unanimously passed the following
resolutions;
WHEREAS, We, the teachers of
Lafayette and adjoining parishes,
have had the advantage of attend
ing the Lafayette State Summer
Normal School the past month;
Therefore, be it resolvesd, That,
we, the teachers attending the said
summer normal school, do hereby
express our high appreciation of
the ability and courtesy of the fac
ulty, Messrs. A. L. Smith, J. E.
Keeny, C. F. Trudeau, Misses
H. Lewis and Clara G. Baer, as
in their management and conduct
of the*school at this place, we
have found them pleasant in all
our relations with them and hope
they may long retain pleasant mem
ories of Lafayette and the teachers
here assembled.
Resolved further, That we ex
tend our sympathy to Prof. Himes
in his recent afflictions. His visit
here will ever be remembered by us
as a pleasant event in our school
experiences; and his advice will
encourage and strengthen us in our
various duties as teachers.
Resolved also, That a copy of
these resolntions be handed to the
papers of Lafayette and adjoining
parishes, also to the Times-Demo
crat and Picayune of New Orleans
for publication.

THE ASSESSOR'S WORK.
The Assessments this Year Will
Show a Considerable In
crease.
The question of a fair and
equitable assessment of property
has always been a hard problem to
solve. In this as well as in all
other parishes, the main trouble
has been that the rich man has
escaped, in a measure, the
burden of taxation, while the fellow I
who owned a few acres of land,
one mule and a cow, was assessed
to the full value of his belongings. I
Of course, this is a rank injustice
whose rectification should receive
the thoughtful consideration of
assessors. Should the constitu
tional convention be held, it is to
be hoped some means will be found
which will make it possible to
equilize the burden of taxation.
What is primarily needed is a law
that will reach the individual who
does not give the assessor a truthful
and complete list of his property.
One has only to spend a few hours
in the assessor's office to see how
reticent some folks are when they
are asked how much of this world's
goods they possess. Especially
among the wealthy is the disposi
tion to shirk the duty of paying
taxes to the government. The
poor man as a rule pays his share
without complaining.
If the large property-holder
could be made to give the full
amount of his possessions, it would
only be a short time before a re
duction of the rate of taxation
would be in order. And this
should be the aim of every assessor
in the State. Assessor A. M. Mar- i
tin of this parish started out in the I
right direction and The Gazette
trusts that he will continue the
good work he has so well begun.
Of course there is yet much to be
done to equilize matters in this
parish. It is doubtful if an abso
lutely fair and equitable assessment
can be had, but there is no question
that a great deal can be accom
plished.
By making a reasonable increase
Mr. Martin has raised the assess
ment of the parish about a quarter
of a million dollars. This he has
done, without finding it necessary
to make any perceptible increase
on the smaller property-owners.
When it is considered that the
erroneous assessments of last year
amounted to over $i oo,ooo, the
augmentation this year is consider
able.
To give our readers an idea of
the increase made by Assessor
Martin this year, we give a few
items.
The total amount of Mr. Mar
tial Billeaud's property last year
was $19,125. This year's assess
ment of this property is not yet
completed, but it is safe to say it
will reach the sum of $37,ooo.
The increase on the refinery alone
is $r 1,ooo.
Eleven thousand dollars has been
added to the Carencro Sugar Man
ufacturing Company.
The property of the Lafayette
Sugar Manufacturing Company was
assessed at $8,ooo. Last year it
was it was fixed at $4,500.
The assessment of the property
belonging to Mr. P. B. Roy and
his heirs amounted last year to $ar ,
885. This year it went up to $24,
805
The rolling stock of the Southern
Pacific Company was also assessed
at a higher figure. The augmenta
tion is $x1,86o.
Mr. Jno. O. Mouton's town prop
erty was assessed at $9,650. This
year it is estimated at $12,995.
The Gazette could go on and
cite a large number of cases where
the assessments were brought up;
but the above items will show the
nature of the work our assessor is
doing.
Mr. Martin and his assistant, Mr.
Aymar Labbe, are working on the
rolls and as soon as they will have
completed their labors, The Gazette
will give the exact increase of the
parish's assessment.
AT SCOTT
News Items Picked Up by The Gazette
Correspondent.
J. T. Mulkern, T. R. Simmons and
Leo Judice went to Lafayette last
Monday night, representing the Scott
Chess Club. They returned home
as champions, having defeated La
fayette players. Scott is always in
the lead.
Mr. Boudreaux, with J. J. Price's
Scott Emporium, will soon move
his family among us.
Our railroad agent is now occu
pying the Doucet mansion on South
avenue.
Our friend, D. Doucet, now

straw hat. Cause: young i
Doucet arrived home early in the a
morning and became a citizen of 1
Scott. Mother and boy doing well. s
Mr. A. C. Prejean has been on
the sick list during the last few
days. We are glad to hear of his
recovery.
Grand preparations are being
made for the concert and fair July
24 and 25. The ladies will com
mence Monday soliciting and we
have no doubt but what they will
be successful. The crowd will be
very large, and the Scott people
should do all they can to accommo
date as well as please.
The grade for the new switch is
complete, and in a few days the
rails and ties will be placed, giving
us more facility to handle the next
cotton crop.
Ice, fans and linen suits are a
necessity at present, on account of
the incessant warm weather.
The Lafayette boys were up to
see us last Sunday and to tackle the
Scott club. We understand the
score was 25 to I in favor of the
Scott nine. Come again, boys.
ORTON.
The Farmers' Institute.
A joint meeting of the farmers'
and teachers' institutes was held at
Falk's Opera House Thursday. A
number of farmers from the country
was present and listened to the in
structive talks of the speakers with
much interest.
The institute was held under the
supervision of Major J. G. Lee,
State commissioner of agriculture.
Judge Julian Mouton called the
meeting to order and in a few
words outlined the scope and pur
poses of the institute.
Major Lee made a strong and
clear plea for more intelligent and
thorough methois in agriculture.
The following program was car
ried out:
Elementary Agriculture in our
Common Schools, Prof. B. C.
Caldwell, president of the State
Normal School.
The Union of the Farmers' and
Teachers' Institutes, Prof. A. L.
Smith, of the Normal School.
Shall We Diversity Our Agricul
ture in Lafayette Parish ? Ben
Avant.
Economy on the Farm. Wm. R.
Foote.
Five Cent Cotton and How to
Raise It. Hon. Charles Schuler,
of Keachi.
Why We Plow, Prof. D. N. Bar
row, assistand director State Ex
periment Station of Baton Rouge.
Major Lee and his able assis
tants left Friday for Opelousas
where an institute will be held
Saturday.
Moss Bros. & Co. announce a
sweeping reduction in prices on
all summer dress goods, such as
dimities, organdies, colored lawns,
percales, duckings, etc. The ladies
may be counted on to take advan
tage of the circumstance, as this
early in the season the demand has
only fairly begun for such a match
less array of sheer and beautiful
summery weaves as is being offered
at Moss Bros. & Co.
A Farewell Reception.
On Thursday afternoon the La
dies' Five O'clock Tea Club was
delightfully entertained at the home
of Mrs. J. D. Trahan. This charm
ing lady and her attractive daugh
ters made each and eves y one feel
at home and their entertainment
will long be a "sweet memory."
A novel idea afforded merriment
for the assemblage. In a "'Floral 1
Love Tale" were hidden the names
of many of our Southland flowers,
and these were to be guessed. The
fortunate ones were the Misses
IMudd. In the tie Miss Lizzie Mudd
was the winner of the prize, a
dainty vase holding fragrant flowers.
An ably rendered instrumental solo
by Mrs. J. Davidson, a beautiful
vocal solo by Mrs. F. Mouton and
a choice selection read in a touch
ing manner by Mrs. Walter Mouton
made up an interesting programme.
Besides being a club meeting this
affair was also a farewell reception
to Mrs. Darling, who so soon leaves
for her former home, Sincoe, Can
ada. During the afternoon the
president, Mrs. Biossat, presented
Mrs. Darling with a lovely cut-glass
and silver bouquet-holder, at the
same time delivering the following
appropriate speech: "A pleasant
duty devolves upon me this after
noon. 'Tis that of presenting in
behalf of the L. F. O. T. Club, to
Mrs. Darling, this little souvenir, as
a token of their love and esteem.
You have endeared yourself to us
by your many winning ways and we
are loathe to give you up, but,
when in your far away Northern
home, surrounded by the friends of
your childhood days, we will be
pleased to think that ) ou remember
with a kindly feeling, your Lafa
yette friends - particularly the
members of the Ladies' Club, who
wish for you all the sweetest and
choicest blessings of life. 'Tis
only a little token, but 'twill serve
as a sweet reminder of happy days
spent in our sunny Southland."
Delicious sherbet and cake were
enjoyed. The invited guests were
as follows: Misses G. Fauntleroy,
J. Sealy, D. Pollard, M. Carron,
L. Cushman, L. Gonsoulin, L.
Olivier, R. DeBlanc, C. Reggio,
R. Farmer, M. Rader, P. Harman
son, Lou Mudd, Amanda Smith.
Base Ball.
Emanuel Pellerin, one of the
Dixies' many faithful backers, in
forms The Gazette that on the 4th
of July next the base ball game of
the season will be played at the
Oak Avenue Park in Lafayette by
the Washington club and the
Dixies.
The unexpected defeat that the
Dixies sustained at Washington has
not cooled their ardor in the least.
They contribute that defeat to a
concatenation of causes and they
feel that under ordinary circum
stances the Washington nine is no
match for the time-honored Dixies
of Lafayette.
The trouble is that the Dixies
have been playing in hard luck and
The Gazette is confident that on
the glorious Fourth they will regain
the championship belt of Southwest
Louisiana.
To-morrow is the excursion to
Houma. Remember the fare is
only $r.5o.
Married.
Mr. John Manville, of Houston,
Texas, and Miss Modeste Robi
chaux, of this town, were married
by Father Boulard at the St. John
Catholic church at 7 o'clock Thurs
day evening. Miss Cornelia Robi
chaux acted as bridesmaid and Mr.
Ralph Voorhies was best man.
After the ceremony at the church
a few friends and relatives gathered
at the residence of the bride's
father, Mr. A. Robichaux, where a
reception was held.
Mr. and Mrs. Manville left the
same night for Houston, where
they will make their home.
The Teachers Entertained.
Thursday evening the citizens of
Lafayette treated the faculty and
teachers attending the Summer
Normal to a fish-fry at Beausejour
Park. 4
At night a lawn patty was given
at the elegant home of Mr. A. M.
Martin. The beautiful lawn in 1
front of the house was illuminated I
by Chinese lanterns which hung to <
wires lined to the trees. A very in- 4
teresting program had been ar
ranged and was well rendered. It
was a very enjoyable affair and
would have been much more so had
not the rain interfered with the
evening's pleasures and hastened the
departure of the guests who were,
from all appearances, having a good
time.
Prenmiums Awarded.
The Sisters of Mount Carmel
convent awarded a number of pre
miums to the deserving pupils of
their school last Wednesday. This
splendid institution has just closed

BOB TAYLOR'S ADDRESS.
Governor Bob Taylor, who admirably
blends the humorous and the pathetic, thus
closed his address of welcome to the Presi
dent and party to the Nashville exposition:
"*In this land of battlefields and monu
ments, in this land of memories touching as
the soldier's last tear on the white bosom of
his manhood's bride, in this land of beauty
and of sorrow, where the white tents of 1
armies shrouded the hills, new cities have
been built in a quarter of a century,
and this splendid industrial exposition,
which is a prophecy of our glory and power
in the future, now blossoms like a beautiful
flower in the track of war, and is a token of
eternal peace and brotherhood between the
two sections.
",Tennessee clasps hands with Ohio
to-day, and the North and South are one
and inseparable. Mason and Dixon's line
is still there, but thank God, it is no longer
the open mouth of death which once swal
lowed up the best and bravest sons of the
nation. Time has closed its bloody lips,
and it is the red scar of honor across the
breast of the republic which marks the
unity of our once divided country.
"We greet our guests with the ardent
hope that every hour of their mingling with
our people may be as sweet as a song and
delightful as a glass of sparkling wine.
"I congratulate my State, and the South
and the whole country, upon the fact that
the ruler of the greatest nation of the world,
accompanied by the first lady of the land,
and by members of his cabinet and others
who are distinguished in the councils of the
nation, prompted by their zeal for the hap
piness of the people and the development of
our wealth, have stolen away from the pa
triotic Pilgrims, who are still in Washington
pining for the president's autograph, to lis
ten to the music of Southern progress.
"I pledge them the honor of Tennessee
that while they remain in our borders the
tariff question shall hb, outlawed by our hos
pitality and the money question shall be
strangled by our courtesy. And when they
depart from us we will pin upon the lapels
of the president and each one of his party a
sweet forget-me-not."
MLarried
Last Saturday at St. Peter's
church in Carencro by the Rev.
Father Laforest, Mr. Rene Durio
and Miss Celica Guilbeau. A large
number of people attended the
ceremony after which they repaired
to the home of the bride where re
freshments were served. Miss
Bertha Richard played the nuptial
march at the church.
A Divine in Trouble.
Toussaint Broussard, a colored
divine who has been engaged sev
eral times in undertakings not at all
in keeping with his high calling,
again strayed from the narrow path
of virtue, and now, instead of being
employed in ministerial pursuits, he
is enjoying the unstinted hospitality
of Mr. Thomas Mouton in the ele
gant quarters on the second floor of
the New St. Charles. Toussaint, it
seems, appropriated to his use some
tobacco that belonged to Mr. Albert
Trahan, of Scott.
A Requie, Mass.
The Catholics of this parish are

The Boas Academy gave its an
nual exhibition at Falk's Opera
House on Friday. June i8. The
large attendance was an unmistaka
ble evidence of the popularity of
this school and the manner in
which the program was presented

teachers and pupils and those who
volunteered their aid to make the
affair the success that it proved to
be.
