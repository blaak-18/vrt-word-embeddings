A'OTRIHR BOAT SIIKS
8teamer City of Golconda Goes Down
Near Paducah.
SEVERAL LIVES LOST
It Is Known That Fourteen Lest Their
rves sad the Vleitim ay
Reach Tweaty-Beat Was
ig Overturned by a Storm.
Paducah, Ky.. Aug. 21.-The steamer
City of Goloonda, plying between this
city and Elizabethtown, Ills., was struck
by a squall during a storm about 7
Monday night as she was en route
to Paducah. and turned over in 10 feet
of water, six miles above the city as
she was going into Orowells landing.
Sixteen persons are reported drowned.
The disaster occunrred as suapper was
being served and many of the 75 pas
sengers were in the cabin. The wind
struck the boat without warning and
there was no time for those inside to
escape. Captain Jesse Bauer and Pilot
E. E. Peck were the last to leave the
boat and swam ashore. They saved
several struggling in the water and left
the survivors in a house near the bank
and came to the city.
Oaptain Basuer who arrived here two
houars after the catastrophe said:
"The boat was getting ready to land
when the squall struck here and she
listed. Several persons who were In
side jumped overboard and were caught
by the boat. The women, all of whom
were in the cabin, conld not be reached.
The boat settled down in 10 feet of
water over a reef and two of the men
who werein the cabin, H. E. Wortea
and N. Quartermouse of Hampton,
broke through the glass and saved three
negro deck hands, a woman and a child,
and I think she was she only woman
saved. A yawl that had broken loose
was caught by some of those straggling
in the water and taken to the bank. We
returned to the boat baut could find no
v'gns of life and returned to shore."
The boat was valuned at $2500 and bees
n trade for several years, being owned
ay Captain Otto Baner, of Golconda,
ills.
There is no way to determine the
lanber of the names of ;he dead until
be bsts boolse are found. Captain
ianner places the number at 16
The Mary N left for the wreck soon
ifter the survivors reached the city fur
lie scene and returned at 11 Mou
lay night with those saved. It is re
xrted that 1') woman were drowned
:nd the total number of those who per
shed will reach 17 or 20. None of the
xxiies were recovered as the rescuer'
,uld not get into the cabin. The only
vman seved was Mrs. Hayden, wife
.f the engineer.

Soon Have Other Mills Ia
Operation at Pittaburg.
Pittsburg, Aug. 21.-The tienp of the
Continental and Pennsylvania tube
plants of the National Tube company in
this city wars completed during Monday
night and early this morning. The ma.
ehinists and the few other employee of
the Pennsylvania works have gone out
but otherwise the two properties are si
lent and deserted. The shutting down
of the two plants adds about 1800 men
to the force of strikers, and has cheered
the other strikers to a high pitch of en
thn asm.
Officials of the National Tube compa
my would not discuss the strike beyond
saying they had been keenly disappoint
ed throughout the strike by the attitude
of their men and they hope that in time
they will come to their senses and come
back. Another steel offcial when told
of the strike said:
"Let the good work go on. Brother
Shaffer is very rapidly getting a top
heavy strike. The larger his army, the
quicker it will break up. Just wait
until he begins to hastle money for
strike benefts. I hope Chicago does go
out. The more the merrier."
Steel managers announce another
mill was on at Olark mills and that the
property is now running in full. Other
properties they say are running as they
were Monday. They denied the story
that there had been a break at Da-i
queens.
The strikers claim they have again
erippled the IAndsay and Moutoheon I
mills by taking some of the naon-union
men and also capturing several skilled
i men on the way into the plant, bat the
managers say they are workling one
mill as nauml and will have a couple
more mills onbefore the snd of the

for the arst time. There was some dis.
