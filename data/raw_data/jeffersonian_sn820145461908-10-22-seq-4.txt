PAGE FOUR
In every essential particular, my creed
tonight is the same that it was
twenty years ago. Nobody had to
pay me to embrace it; nobody has
paid me to remain true to it.
To maintain my position through
out the bitterness of these eighteen
years has not been easy. The tempta
tion to surrender and thus escape
persecution, proscription and politi
cal isolation was very great. The
things I have had to bear, a proud
man finds difficult to endure. To see
old friends turn their backs when you
enter a hotel lobby, to avoid meeting
you; to lift your hat to ladies and
girls on the street and to have your
courtesy received with mockery and
jeers; to offer your hand to old
friends on the cars and have it re
fused; to have wagon loads of drunk
en negroes sent to your house at
night to yell and hoot their insolent
taunts, in the hearing of your wife
and children; to attempt to address
your fellow citizens on the principles
of Jeffersonian Democracy, as you
understand them, and to be howled
down, and owe your life to the in
vention of brave friends and sympa
thizing policemen; to be so menaced
in your own home that a picket of
armed men seemed to be absolutely
necessary to protect it from murder
ous attack —these are the things
which try the souls of men, and
through these things I am not the
only Populist in the Southern States
who has had to make his way.
I thank the God who made me for
the strength that sustained me dur
ing those terrible years, and which
enabled me to hold the rudder true. I
believe that the time has at last come
when the people of my State are be
ginning to appreciate the helplessness,
the hopelessness, the humiliation, of
their political position, and that a
change is at hand. I believe that the
State of Georgia will give me, on the
strength and soundness and patriot
ism of my position, such support on
the 3rd day of November that the
electoral vote of Georgia will here
after be uncertain. The moment this
glorious event is achieved the whole
political situation of this republic
will be in process of revolution. With
Hon. Thos. E. Watson
WILL MAKE ADDRESSES AT THE FOLLOWING POINTS:
ARLINGTON, GA., October 21. DOUGLASVILLE, GA., October 28..
THOMASVILLE, GA., October 22. FORSYTH, GA., October 29. “ ,
WAYCROSS, GA., (at night) October 22. LaGRANGE, GA., October 30.
LUDOWICI, GA., October 23. MACON, GA. (at night), November 2.
LINCOLNTON, GA., October 26. Speaking At All Places Begins At 10 A. M.
CRAWFORDVILLE, GA., October 27.
A regular schedule of Mr. Watson’s speeches will be printed in the Jef
fersonian during the campaign, and every voter in Georgia will be given an
opportunity to hear him.
the vote of Georgia made uncertain,
the Solid South is threatened with a
break-up, and with the breaking up
of the Solid South will come the
dawn of a better, brighter day, not
only for Georgia and the South, but
for the whole Union.
Inspired by this belief, it has been
a work of love for me to campaign
the State. I have concentrated my
efforts within her borders because of
my resolution to hew to the line of
my own purpose regardless of Taft,
regardless of Bryan, regardless of
anything except the fixed ambition to
do something that will tend to restore
the Southern States to the splendid
position which they once held in the
government of the nation.
I shall never be President myself,
but I am blazing the trail along
which some other Southern man will
take his way to the White House. I
am marking out the road along which
Southern statesmanship will lead the
South back to her former power. To
the extent that I have made the
march this year, I have shortened it
for those who will come after me; to
the extent to which I have carried
the battle line I lessen the struggle
for those who shall win the final
victory. The prophet dies, but the
world lives —can never die —continues
its message, encouraging the work of
noble men and noble women to the
end of time. The color bearer falls,
but other hands catch up the flag and
bear it on. It will not be mine to
enter the harvest field and join in
the song of those who reap the grain,
but I am sufficiently rewarded by the
consciousness that I have sown good
seed upon fruitful soil, and I care
not who garners the grain so the peo
ple get the bread.
It may not be mine to see the
standard flying in triumph over the
intrenchments of special privilege
which the masses have stormed and
taken, nor hear the glad shout of the
unprivileged millions as they enter in
to their own; but I am content to
feel that my duty has been done as
well as I could do it; that I have
fought a good fight, and have been in
strumental in making the final tri
umph certain.
‘Glje 3effarsoniart
To see the South throw off the sack
cloth of her political desolation, to
see her rise to the full height of her
strength and independence, to see her
take her confident way • toward a
brighter future, with the light of hope
in her lustrous eyes and the Miriam
song of Victory on her imperial lips
—has been one of my fondest dreams.
To see our country get over the aw
ful effects of the Civil War, section
al hatred buried, the class legisla
tion which came with the war re
pealed, the growth of plutocracy
checked, the spirit of Justice and
Equality restored to our laws and
government —Jias been another of my
dreams.
To help bring these things about is
surely a patriotic purpose. The best
years of my life have been devoted
to it. In spite of all that has befallen
me, I am neither defeated nor dis
couraged. Believing that the prin
ciples for which we Jeffersonians
stand mean the salvation of our coun
try, I am their soldier, to march and
fight at every call of the bugle—this
year, and all the years to come.
And if every man who in his heart
of hearts believes that we are right
would have the manhood to vote with
us, there would be, throughout the
South on the 3rd of November, such
an awakening, such an Easter, as war
cursed Dixie has not known since our
flag went down in the blood, the tears,
the heart-break of Appomattox.
