HAD DOGS.
' - Just before going to près« we
learned that a partybelew
Johnsons were out with guns iu
pursuit of a mad dog. On last
Holiday another esb^vd sympa
thies of bydrapliobi*, aud bad to
bo killed... We found one standing
at our gâté this moruiug that look
ed ratbur suspicious, and called
tbe attention of a geutlcmau pres
ent who coucured in oor opinion.
We called attention to, thjs sub
ject two weeks ago, and then
thought, as we now think, that tbe
Town Council onght to prohibit
dogs upon the streets for a|. le-st
30 days, until tbis disease bas; pass
ed away. We see the Gonnciï bavé
compromised by notifying éll per
sons to put collars on their dogs.
We don't know whether oue of
these collars will keep a dog frofti
going mad or not, bat if it will not,
we presume tho Council think it
better that our children and wives
and other citizen! should be occa
sionally bitten by »mad dog with a
collar on, th'^ti that the rights and
liberties of the dogs should be in
fringed upon. This point we differ
from the Utrancil'. To us the bite
of a nad dog and its consequences
is the horror of horrors. If one of
iny children were thus bitten, and I
forced to witness its raging hydra
phobia; its lucid intervals, which
come only to recall its sweet iife,
and heighten my agouy , it would
lie a sorrow whose phantom would
be ever present ; and not the less
bitter because]! thought; and be
lieved that it was caused by the
Town Council fearing they might
iitfriryre the right and libertfes of a
gang of worthless dogs.
In spite of onrself I would ever
think that &e blood of my child, or
Wife, or friend« lay at the door of
the town Council in neglecting to
take such measures as common
prudence suggest; and such will
be the opinion of this community
O ub N jbw S hketff .—Mr. rani
the candidateelected by tbe White
People at the last election, has at
last been commissioned. His ac
cession to office marks a new era in
our Parochial bistoty since 1868.
From that period tbe white people
have been as thoroughly prescribed
froin all participation in the gov
ernment as if they were political
lepers. The assessmen t of taxes,
Legislation, Public Schools, Taxa
tion and administration of law have
beeu taken control of by the ne
groes, andcommited to men with
one or two exceptions, utterly in
competent, and who had no more
interest in the moral and physical
welfare of the Parish than they had
in the welfare of China.
We have always believed Mr.
Paul would make a good Sheriff,
ami We congratulate our citizens ou
his accession to the^Sheriffalty.
T he W e A theb .—We had rain
all day on last Saturday, aud long
enough to fill the ditches. In the
evening tbe wind blew almost a
gale from the Northwest and con
tinued all night It was a true
Norther aud its birth place was
doubtless'amid the snow snmmitsof
tbe Bocky Mountains. On Snnday
morniug icicles around tl^e cisterns
were thick and long, but we saw
no ice upou the ground or i" the
ditches. It cleared off in the morn
ing, and towards evening the
weather moderated, and although
we had » heavy frost The fruit
uninjured. We have had this
week the longest clear aud dry
spell that we have had since Christ
maSf fpur day. On Thursday we
had Another cold and rainy <lay.
And » slight shower on Friday
niorning and cleared up in the
evening. .

measures as arbitrary tyrannical as
the Arkansas Message aud the
Force-Bill, and,as corrupt a$i
tax bill, but there never was a time
when tîië supporters of such WHs

of these bills deemed such preten
sions no longer necessary. The
force bill was openly advocated as
necessary to the campaign of 1876.;
It was defeated for want of tine,:
although some of the leading Be ,
publicans not only refused to sup
port it, but bitterly opposed it. |
Its defeat and the rejection of the
Arkansas Message, have very much
deranged the plan of the Adminis
tration for 1876, t)ut it is scattered
rather than destroyed. Geu. But
ler is now engaged in preparing an
address whose burden is to show
that there is »'conspiracy of th«|
rich at work to oppress the labors
ing classes and at the South to op
press tho negroes, and an appeal to
them to unite against their oppres
sors. This will be tbe first born of
American Communism and worthy
of its parent. The inouster that
has preyed npon the South until its
fields are desolate, is now to be
turned loose U]K>n the rich of the
North, and its march, of triumph
will be as sure and irresistible there
as it has been here. The tich Ban
ker and Capitalist and bond-hold
ers who nnited with the contrat
tors who last year, for the sake of
contraction united with the govern
ment instead of the agricultural!
of the West, will now find thpr
solves aiding in a contest, which
when triumphant, will/ turn
upon them with the same
remorseless appetite ' » with which
it has devoured its opponents.
We await with some curiosity the
ijext move upou the political chess
board« which is to develop the re
modeled plan for 1876..,
The Senate on jnesday night,

The 4 feet rise of the Biver last
week wos merely the result of Lo

Monday and is nqw falling. It is
falling at Shreveport and although
high enough between that point
and this for tho largest class of
boats to get along safely by day,
it was too low for the Maria Louise
with ber heavy load to run at
night Below this point we have
a fine river.
From all indications, we are to
have low ws^ter at an unusually
early period and to have it for an
unusually long one. The winters
of 1351 & 2 1854 & 5 and 1863 & 4
were winters of unusual severity.
Those ot 1854 & 5 and 1863 & 4
were followed by unusually low
water. Wfe are not posted about
the water of 1S52, but presume it
followed the same law. This win
ter bas been in severity not much ;
if any behind, either of those win

to tbe people. It was ratifietl by
an overwhelming vote. The ma

beeu at peace ior the first time

open. No class of citizens is <^is

been denied by the courts, by the
