PAGE TWO
Mrs. Marion Todd on Woman Suffrage
Editor Jeffersonians: —You say in
your weekly Jeffersonian of February
24th, in an article entitled “The Man
and the Woman,” that the very first
result of woman suffrage in the coun
try would be to augment the power
of the papal hierarchy.
We know this would be the result;
in which case I would deem it a ca
lamity if such suffrage predominated.
Your othei’ objection to the ques
tion, based upon the natural differ
ence between the sexes, it seems to
me does not at all hit the mark. Are
you not begging the question when
you base your objection upon a mere
matter of anatomy?
You say that “whenever the men
become incapable of government the
end of all things has arrived.”
One could easily be persuaded that
the end of all things had already ar
rived, judging by the reading of your
publications.
Never have facts been set forth in
such ringing, powerful and scholarly
terms, and every true man and wo
man must thank God that you live to
do it.
That you should be absolutely right
upon every question, however, would
be a marvel.
Because woman is physically dif
ferent from a man, you would with
hold the ballot from her. Why not
disfranchise man because he is dif
ferent from woman?
Upon a basis of difference in struc
ture if only one sex should vote, we
want to be mighty sure we have
struck the right sex. Thus far we
have never had a certificate from the
Almighty that man should vote. We
have had nothing higher than man's
certificate touching upon his adapt
ability for the ballot and his superior
and exalting qualifications to govern
his mother. You say if Nature
meant woman to do the same things
as man, “why should they not have
been created along the same lines?”
Indeed they are created along the
same lines in many ways. Both
sexes have to eat and drink and
sleep, both love and hate —rejoice
and suffer. If its a matter of physi
cal difference, where are you to draw
the line? Or is any difference at all
sufficient for her condemnation?
It is true she can not throw a ball
like a man, as you have charged, but
if she could would this help the case
—would it better qualify her to cast
a ballot? If so, what a pity she can
not throw from the shoulder.
You say man is built on lines of
strength—woman with reference to
grace and beauty—that the promi
nent structural features of the man
are his large head, thick neck, broad
shoulders, strong arms, etc. Now
the strength of woman, while infe
rior to man, is quite equal to the or
deal of placing a little piece of paper
in a box. The twenty-five to fifty
thousand wives and widows in New
York city who are forced to support
their families, with plenty of hus
bands thrown in to be supported,
possess sufficient strength to cast a
ballot.
You say in the normal woman the
whole physique is built with refer
ence to the womb and the nurture
of its fruit. Yes, but why should
this fact bar her from the ballot?
It should crown her queen of the
world. This most divine function
should grant her the supremacy in
government.
If the ballot must be based upon
the physical difference between man
and woman, let it be the basis of
motherhood clothed with her supe
rior moral and spiritual sense.
You ask us to consider how fully
the time of the mother is taken up
in the bearing and rearing of her
children, and what time she has for
lawmaking?
Would not her vote count for as
much, and would she not possess the
same natural right as the average
business man, who never takes the
time to inquire into political mat
ters?
It is proverbial that he votes as
some king bee votes, regardless of
the slightest thought of his own.
But think of the wife so over
whelmed with duties that she has no
time to read, think and consider
matters which so deeply concern her
as the laws of the land under which
she is obliged to live. Is not such a
wife a drudge and slave?
Does not such a condition deprive
wedlock of all romance, poetry and
divinity? When mothers possess no
opportunities for growth and ad
vancement, God pity the race of men.
The law of South Carolina which
robs a- mother of her babes when the
father pleases, though he be a drunk
en beast, is an instance where Jaw
concerns mothers, and illustrates the
great necessity for woman’s con
sideration in lawmaking.
To the mother belongs the fruit of
her body, and naught but an accurs
ed government would rob her of
them.
You say if women voted they
would have to vote with the male
members of the family or antagonize
them, breeding inharmony. If wo
men were forced to vote as their hus
bands have been voting, there would
be no advantage in woman suffrage.
It would be as bad as woman’s bal
lot controlled by the Pope, if not
worse.
Although I claim to have as good
a natural right to the ballot as a
man, yet I care nothing for the bal
lot for the sake of the ballot. It is
results that are desired.
Woman asks for the ballot that
she may overturn many laws of
man; such laws, for instance, as the
law of consent, which protects the
lecherous scoundrel when he seeks to
devour twelve to fourteen-year-old
girls.
(Mrs.) MARION TODD.
Answer.
All honor to Mrs. Marion Todd!
Her name is dear to every man who
has ever fought for Reform.
(1) I did not mean to base an
argument “upon a mere matter of
anatomy”. The difference between
the sexes is something more than
anatomical. The normal woman
differs from the typical man in every
respect—mentally and spiritually, as
well as physically. In fact, neither
is complete without the other. It
takes his mate to complete the man
—and no natural, normal, full-sexed
female was ever complete or happy
without her mate. The rule runs
throughout creation, without a soli
tary exception.
(2) If the ballot belonged to the
woman’s sphere, as the needle does,
she -would be welcome to it, so far
as lam concerned. But I resent the
intrusion of women in those activi
ties where the man should do the
-work.
War and Government are to the
strong—to the men. There have
been, and are now, Amazons; but we
Teutonic peoples do not want our
wives, mothers, daughters, and sis
ters, to become soldiers. We don’t
want lady judges and juries. We
don’t want our women making our
laws, and administering the affairs
of Government.
That’s the man’s part.
There are exceptional women, like
Mrs. Todd, whom I would be willing
to take counsel with, on matters of
the gravest public importance; but
I would feel bitterly humiliated if I
had to obey the orders of even Mrs.
Todd.
There are thousands of extraordi
narily gifted women who would vote
better than thousands of inferior
"-Jeffersonian
men—just as there are thousands of
men who can excel women as cooks,
dressmakers, and laundry operators.
But as a general thing, women are
weaker than men —in mind as well
as in body.
(3) The very word, “King”,
meant, in the original German, “the
ablest TO DO.” It was given to the
strongest man, not because he differ
ed from women, but because he was
the most masterful of the masterly
men. Once, the could only
maintain Authority by brute force.
The modern sceptre is the lineal de
scendant of the Big Stick of the tri
bal chief. How could the weaker ves
sel have dominated those turbulent,
ferocious, hard-drinking, marauding
tribesmen?
Once in an age, some Boadicea, or
Joan of Arc, might spring up and
seize on evanescent leadership; but
such a thing as this modern invasion
of man’s sphere by women, was ut
terly unknown to our free and hon
ored Teutonic ancestresses.
It is a symptom of a decaying
civilization. It was so in Rome: it
was so with the ancient regime in
France.
(5) That the man now has the
ballot, comes of the fact that Gov
ernment has changed its forms and
its instruments. But the right to
vote is exclusively that of the male
sex, as it is the duty of being the
soldier, the seaman, the road-maker
and the bridge builder.
Even such monstrosities as Mrs.
O. H. P. Belmont, would be horrified
to see the ladies digging another
subway, throwing another bridge
across to Brooklyn, or putting to
gether, hundreds of feet up in the
air, the skeleton of a sky-scraper.
No manly man would like to see wo
men doing the work of carpenters,
brick-masons, train-crews, black
smiths, or saw-mill laborers.
(6) Is Mrs. Todd correct when
she says that the Almighty never
gave man a certificate that he could
vote? When we speak of the ballot
and of voting, the question involved
is Government. Was not the male
commissioned by Jehovah to have do
minion? He had named every ani
mate creature that the Almighty had
called into existence before he even
thought about the birds and beasts
being better off than he himself was
—in that he had no mate.
From lid to lid of the Bible is the
story of Man’s superiority: he com
mands, and the Woman obeys. Moses
is leader and law-giver: Joshua is the
Sword of the Lord; Saul and David
and Jonathan go out to do the fight
ing: even the priesthood must be
composed of physically perfect men.
The mothers, wives and daughters
make the Home, keep the house,
prepare the food, minister to the
husbands and fathers, —doing the
work of Help-meet. And when the
warriors return from battle, the
maidens, garlanded and singing
peans of victory, go forth to greet
their heroes.
Throughout the New Testament,
it is the same. The world move
ment, the steering of the national
affairs, the Forward March! of the
new Faith, is the work of the Man.
It is bis to say what shall be the
Law; in his strong hands is the rud
der of Government.
If the fact that women eat, drink,
sleep, snore, laugh and talk gives
them an equal right to Govern, the
same fact will carry them to the
battle line, and the battle-ship—for
soldiers and sailors eat, drink, sleep,
snore, laugh, talk, etc. If because
women eat and sleep, love and hate
like men, they are therefore entitled
to the ballot, I don’t see the con
sistency of Mrs. Todd’s wearing
skirts, instead of—er, the other
things.
(7) It isn’t a question of wheth
er women have the physical and
mental strength to place “a lit
tle piece of paper in a box.” Mrs.
Todd hardly does herself justice,
there. Tremendous social, moral
and psychological consequences fol
low the physically trifling act of
coition —and it is even so with the
ballot. Give it to the wrong class or
sex, and revolutionary results are
certain. It was a very simple thing,
physically, when the negro went to
the polls and cast his first ballot—
but it was an awfully disastrous
thing to the South. Socially, moral
ly, psychologically, our whole situ
tion underwent a change.
So, if the ballot is ever conceded
to women, her own status, as well as
that of Man and the Home, will be
revolutionized. Pray don’t under
stand me to mean that this change
will be in any way comparible to that
made by the negroes and the infa
mous Reconstruction laws.
I agree with Mrs. Todd that modern
conditions are hard on our bread
winners, male and female. Tens of
thousands of good men are doing
their level best to create a public
sentiment that will change things
for the better. But to grant the
vociferous demands of the Suffra
gettes, would not help at all.
The women of Special Privilege
would vote with the Interests; the
women of the slums would vote with
the Sullivans, Murphys, McCarrens,
Durhams and Coxes; the women of
the reformer class would vote with
us, Mrs. Todd; and the net result
would be, Nothing, so far as politi
cal progress goes.
It is clear to my xnind that Woman
is blind to her own best interests
when she clamors for a privilege
which would assuredly disappoint
her, and which would tend inevitably
to lessen the respect and tender con
sideration for her which the higher
type of man has always manifested.

“FOREIGN MISSIONS EXPOSED.”
The demand for this book has
been so great that our first edition
is completely exhausted. Another
edition is now in the press, and will
be ready for delivery next week. In
the meantime we must ask those
who have ordered the book in the
last few days to be patient with us.
