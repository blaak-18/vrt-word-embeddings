“CONDITIONS MUST BE SEEN
TO BE APPRECIATED.’’
Swainsboro, Ga., March 2, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Sir: Pardon my delay in
extending to you my thanks for your
assistance in securing a hearing in
the courts which resulted in my liber
ation from the asylum. I am very
grateful to you for your aid, and I
shall hold myself in readiness at all
times to repay your kindness in any
way that I can. I won out very eas
ily on the attack on the validity of
the commitment, and you’re due much
credit for a publicity which will place
me in a position to greatly benefit my
fellow-man and to perform a service
to my state which, at this time, can
not be estimated.
Conditions at the asylum are inde
scribable, and “must be seen to be
appreciated.” I shall do wbat I can
to bring certain things—great evils
and abuses —to light before the com
ing session of the General Assembly.
I know it is unnecessary to ask for
your co-operation and aid.
I shall deem it an honor and a priv
ilege if I can ever serve you.
Yours very truly,
Geo. H. Bell.
THE GEORGIA STATE ASYLUM.
IT SHOULD BE INVES-
TIGATED.
Memphis, Tenn., Feb. 24, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Though a resident of Ten
nessee, I am a Georgian by birth and
feel deep interest in matters concern
ing the public weal of my native
state.
I have just been reading the pa
pers of the “Jeffersonian” on the
Bell case, and am reminded of one
somewhat similar in the neighborhood
of Marietta, Ga., where much of my
time in summer vacations is spent.
My informant was the sufferer him
self. As he is not and never has been
insane, as his character for honesty
and veracity is unquestioned, I am
compelled to believe his statements,
and they are precisely the same char
acter as those already made in your
paper. They confirm all that is said
there of atrocities committed on the
helpless inmates of this insane asy
lum.
I Wave in my possession letters
written by another person, once an
inmate of the insane asylum, all of
which testify to a horrible system
of corruption, greed, graft and bru
tality.
Neither of these men was insane
when committed. Neither has any
tale to tell of violence offered to him
self; it is of what they saw practiced
on others more helpless and afflicted,
than themsalves, that they speak,
with tihe hope of diminishing or abol
ing such conditions.
In the case of the two men I know,
the w’orst features were the unjust
detention, the confinement, poor food,
ill-prepared, and the outrage commit
ted by relations who procured their
admission to the asylum. Mr. B. per
sonally gave me the following facts:
He is or was a farmer who had al
ways been a hard-working man on
his own little farm. Finally, his
health gave way. He was down for,
XJ' TO THE SANITARIUM
months with a slow fever, and when
it left him he was too weak to work.
After some time, his family, which
then consisted of only a wife and one
son at home, grew tired of caring for
him. They probably argued that his
days of usefulness were past and that
if they could put ' him where he
would be provided for at the expense
of the State, they would have sole
charge of the property and be that
much 'better off. So six “good men
and true” (save the mark!) were
found who, as a jury, swore that they
believed this man insane, and a repu
table physician endorsed or signed
the application. Escorted by his son
and the sheriff, he was taken to Mil
ledgeville and consigned to that lim
bo that passes for a sanitarium. He
was a man of about sixty years of
age, and at that time still feeble,
though not ill. His only trouble was
that he was weak and unable to work.
His mind w r as perfectly clear, his men
tal faculties unimpaired, as his friends
and neighbors who saw him most fre
quently, testify.
He felt all this very keenly, but
realized that he was powerless to help
himself. As he submitted quietly to
restrictions, was able to care for his
person, and did what was required
of him in the way of work, he was
not harshly treated. Plain as the
fare was, poor, in fact, he would not
have complained of it had it only
been better prepared and served. Tur
nips cooked without the ceremony of
washing were put on the table un
seasoned save for the grit in them;
stale beef, very weak coffee, also un
seasoned except that once a week
some sugar was put into the pot—
these items give some idea of how
they fared. When he had been there
about a week, the physician came
around and prescribed a tunic for
him. Tliis was absolutely the only
treatment he received there. Surely
one need not go to an insane asylum
for a simple medical prescription!
Well, he watched and 'waited his op
portunity, 11 hided his time, ’ ’ saw how
other cases really serious were treated
and collected a good eal of informa
tion from the experiences of those
with whom he conversed. After tak
ing the same tonic for six months,
he remonstrated, saying that if the
food were more appetizing he would
not need any medicine.
Not to trespass too much on your
time and patience, I will only add of
Mr. B. that he finally succeeded in
getting a letter “through the lines”
to a friend at Marietta. By the uni
ted efforts of this friend and others,
he was finally restored to freedom
after some two years at the asylum.
Mr. B. has shown a most forbearing,
Christian spirit, and would prefer not
to speak at all of their treatment of
him, but he feels that these circum
sbatistics are already known in his
community, and that the whole man
agement of the asylum ought to be
investigated, for the sake of other
unfortunates.
One man to whom he talked had
been there fifteen years. Though per
fectly sane, he says, “Well, I’m here
for life; there is no one living, any
way, interested in getting me out.”
The case of a young girl who had
been there was of special interest to
me. She was for awhile out of health
and in consequence her mind was in
3effersonlan
an abnormal condition. But I infer
from what I have heard of the case,
that if her own mother had been alive
she could and wmuld have been cared
for at home. She was an heir to
some $30,000 wmrth of property, and
had a stepmother who had children
of her own. The young patient soon
recovered her health of body and
mind, but somehow was not dismissed.
She stayed on and on until finally
friends who saw the stepmother and
her children enjoying the income from
the property, grew suspicious, made
inquiries, and at last succeeded in
getting her released, but not without
difficulty.
There are other cases of this nature
I could tell you of, and if you like,
would mail you some letters from a
former inmate of the institution.
Grewsome tales arc related of bar
barities, of which these men were eye
witnesses, of atrocities perpetrated
on the sick and dying, on those hope
lessly insane; treatment which un
doubtedly has helped to bring about
the death or establish the insanity of
many a victim. Assuredly, convict
camps are not the only places where
“men die like dogs. 77
Mr. Watson, you are doubtless'by
this time in possession of a good deal
of information on this unhappy sub
ject; can you, will you not rouse our
state so that this iniquity shall be
wiped out?
Make them hew to the line. Let
them employ men who will prove ef
ficient, above all, honest; men to whom
the life and well-being of a man and
brother is a sacred trust. Then let
us have inspectors worthy of the
name, and see to it that trustworthy
employes are found.
Make what use you pleafee of this
communication, and God speed what
ever effort you may make toward les
sening this evil. Yours very truly,
(Miss) Margaret L. Scudder.

Dear Friend: I write you a few
lines to let you know how they treated
Mr. T. L. O ’Kelley in September,
1907.
They treated him like they did Bell
at Swainsboro, Ga. They did not give
him any morphine to send him to the
State Sanitarium. They tried him
with six jurymen. I understand that
they had or did not issue any warrant
for him. He was not present at the
trial on the 11th day of September,
1907. I wish you would write to him
about the following questions:
1. How many jurymen does the law
require to try a man for insanity in
Georgia ?
2. Has he not got a right under the
laws of Georgia to have counsel to de
fend him and have witnesses to prove
that he is not crazy?
3. What is the meaning of malprac
tice in office under the Georgia laws?
4. What is the law concerning es
tate that is turned over to a guardian
under the laws of Georgia, when it
was not advertised?
5. Do they have to be advertised 30
days in the county paper to be law-

Epilepsy,
Fits
Convulsions, or Spasms
and St. Vitus’ Dance are
Nervous Diseases. Most
cases can be cured by
strengthening and build
ing up the nervous system.
To do this a nerve medi
cine is needed. Dr. Miles’
Nervine will be found
efficacious and satisfac
tory. It has cured many
cases of these diseases
and w r e believe it will
cure you. We can give
you names of many who
have been cured through
its use. Write for advice.
"My son John had epilepsy for years,
and after having him treated by
specialists for over 2 years he still
continued to have spells. I had al
most given up in despair, but know
ing the virtue of Dr. Miles’ Anti-Pain
Pills for sick, headache, I concluded to
try the Nervine.' During June, 1906, I
gave him a teaspoonful three times a
day, then in July 1 gave it as directed,
and I could see that he was improving,
and he has not had a spell since
August 28, 1906, and has taken no
medicine since Jan.-07. I am writing
the case just as it is hoping it will
induce others to try it.”

TOM WATSON MELON—72 POUNDS
The best all-round melon grown in
Georgia. It has every g«od quality of
the famous Georgia Rattlesnake and is
superior to that variety in that it is
almost free from rotten ends. It is a
much better shipping melon, and it is
a much better keeper. It is superior
to the KLECKLEY MELON in that it
grows much larger and has all the
sweetness of that variety.
I have been growing melons for the
market for the past twenty-five years
and have tried all of the varieties
known in Georgia, and have no hesi
tancy in saying that the TOM WAT
SON melon comes nearer meeting
every requirement than any variety I
ever saw. I consider the seed to be
