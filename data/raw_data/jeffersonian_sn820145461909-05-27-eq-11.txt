A Champion of Lumber Trust
May 13; 1909.
Hon. Titos. E. Watson, Thomson, (jit.:
Dear Sir—The undersigned has
been a subscriber to The Jeffersonian
for some time, and generally reads
all of your editorials. Many of your
ideas I adopt as tny own, because I
think you are right. Uptfii the other
hand, thebe afe sbiiie 1 haiindt iiidoi'se.
You are eiefnaily aiid iitiaiiebiihiv
opposed to trusts, and never rieglbfct
an opportunity of lambasting- them to
a “silk finish’’—pardon the vernacu
lar of the street. Recently you have
“jumped” on what you term the
“lumber trust” with “both feet,”
and have mercilessly castigated those
southern members of oongTesf Who
voted to retain the duty oil lumber.
You probably forget that when pros
perity was “ill the saddle” in this fa
vored section of the lir'Ji’fll vineyard,
the.price of timber went lift like a tdli
of dynamite had been exploded uridei’
it. Timber that had been selling for
from seventy-five cents 'to one dollar
and a half per acre went up to ten,
twelve and in some instances, to sl7
and S2O per acre, simply for
“saw-mill privilege.” There had to
be corresponding increase in the price
of the manufactured article, else the
millmen would have been bankrupted.
Now, the prices for timber per acre
was not paid to syndicates who had
bought up all the timber; it was not
paid to a “trust” which had been
formed to Control the price of trees!,
but it went directly iillo the pockets
of the farmers who owned timber in
small tracts, and it Was the meads of
putting an eiiOrihUuS amount of mon
ey into circulation iiiid tiaiisbd tile de
velopment of other industries which
in turn put more mchlCy iiito biihula
tion, and the Wealth of our state was
increased materially. Os Uthifse the
mill men have made money; that is,
some have, while others in the faCh
of auspicious conditions have “gone
br< ke. ” But it is unneceSsal’y lb re
view all of these facts. The purpose
of this letter is to ask you what dif
ference is there between the lumber
men getting together and fixing a
scale of prices to control all their pro
duct, and the farmers of the state get
ting together and agreeing not to sell
their cotton for less than a stipulated
price per pound"? Or which is the
most reprehensible and the most im-
; <1 and the most corrupting, for
the lumber men to fix a scale and live
up to it, Or for the farmers of the
south to contribute a dollar each and
after raising several millions of dol
lars turn it over to a notorious “cot
ton gambler” and let him go “on
change” in Wall Street and boost the
price of cotton"?
Now, Mr. Watson, 1 am not criticis
ing you or your attitude in an unkind
spirit. I admire you for a great many
things. Your ability is of the highest
order; your devotion to the south is
unquestioned; your fearlessness is pro
verbial, but now make your “fair
ness” also proverbial. Accord to one
the same privilege you seek for an
other. For so many years has the
south been the prey of the north that
only by the greatest good luck do we
maintain our commercialism. Had
the south the benefit of legislation
that the north has had, we would to-
Jeffersonian
dity be the richest and most influen
tial section Os the United States, and
instead o’s seefeiiig faVffts, politically
and otherwise, we would be dispens
ing them. Unless the “bars are to be
let down” and all of the necessities
of life, regardless of which section
of our county is affected, admitted
duty free; unless our farmers have
the same opportunity that the west
ern farittet enjoys; unless our cotton
manufhCftite Is placed on an equality
with the northern fflafittfaHurer in or
der that he can compete for the trade
of the nation, then I am for a duty ovi
every product of the south. 1 do not
believe that our products should be
discriminated against. 1 do slot be
lieve in admitting Egyptian cotton
duty free and placing an import duty
on wheat. 1 do not believe that it is
right or jiust to admit lumber (soft
Woods) free, which the south practi
cally ifloiie produces, and place a
beaUy ittipb’rt duty on hard woods,
which is confined to the
northern and middle states, it is giv
ing the manufacturers of that section
an undue advantage over us.
The southern members of congress,
both branches, ought to be commend
ed for expending their energies in be
half of measures that will increase
the wealth and prosperity of the
south instead of being condemned and
villifled and accused of having “sold
out” or gome over to the republicans.
Mr. Watson, you were elected to
congress by the democrats; you were
duly nominated in a democratic con
vention, yet you admit that you took
yous instructions how to vote in con
gress from the Faliind's* Alliance, and
now you see lit io censure Mr. Brant
ley arid Other members of Congress for
voting not entirely in accord with the
platfdf-iii adopted by the Denver con-
Veiitibii: lit is flu defense for you to
say that the farmers’ Alliance was in
the majority in the Tenth district at
the time you were elected. They were
democrats aiid Voted ill ft democratic
primary, or participated in a demo
cratic convention; in either event, it
is the same thing. A platform was
adopted which, as you now argue, was
tin liistfulHidil to vote for certain
things. This you admit not having
done, but accepted instructions from
the Alliance. But now that Mr.
Brantley and other democrats have
done just exactly as you did, you call
on the people to turn them out. Be
fair, Mr. Watson. Be just.
Get the spleen out of your system,
and 1 will vote for you for the high
est office in the gift of Georgia. For
get the past. Probably you have been
villifled and politically robbed. 1
don’t deny any or all of this. It is
possible that you have been ostracised
and had contumely heaped upon you.
1 know you have, but to every cloud
there is a silver lining. You have
many years yet before you. You can
be of inestimable value to your state
and nation.
I trust you will not take offense at
the thought conveyed and suggested in
this letter, but will accept same in the
spirit in which it is written.
Yours very truly,
W. F. Way.
Do not get the impression that I
condemn your suggestion for farm-
