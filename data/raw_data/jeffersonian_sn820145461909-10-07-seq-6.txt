WANTS MORE OF THEM.
Dear Sir: —Thank you for the ed
itorials, “Is the South Glad it Lost’’
and “As to Dickinson’s Gettysburg
Address.” Give us some more like
them. This is one time we most
assuredly agree. You are doing a
great work.

ABOUT RIDING ASTRIDE.
Dear Sir: —I find a statement pub
lished in your paper that Represent
ative Wright, of Georgia, had in
troduced in the Legislature a bill
providing a penalty for any woman
who rides astride a horse.
For what reason or purpose does
he wish to stop women riding astride
a horse?
’ Riding astride is far the safest
way, besides the most comfortable,
becoming and graceful. Accidents are
frequent to women horseback-riding
upon the side-saddle. It was the
common way in old times for women
to ride astride. The Indian women
have always done so and are as
expert riders as the men.
In all countries where the travel
is dangerous or mountainous, wom
en ride astride for comfort and safe
ty. Then why should Mr. Wright
try to stop the growing fashion of
riding astride?
My father, Jonathan Gillmore,
taught school at Milledgeville, Ga.,
from 1800 until 1810, and my best
wishes have always been for the peo
ple of Georgia.
JESSE GILLMORE.
San Diego, Cal., Sept. 9, 1909.
The bill was given no legislative
consideration. Commenting upon the
history of the saddle, Jefferson Jack
son, editor National Harness Review,
Chicago, writes:
“It is said that the Queen of Rich
ard II of England, known as Anne
of Bohemia, invented the side-sad
dle. It is claimed that on account
of a deformed hip she wanted a sad
dle of this kind in order to make a
good appearance while riding. This
was about 13 88. This tale has of
ten been contradicted by other au
thorities, and so you may take it for
what it is -worth.
“It is quite plain to me that the
side-saddle is merely the pillion in
another and simpler form. Looking
at old prints and fragments of har
ness which have come down to us;
we can trace the development of the
side-saddle. It did not come into
fashion until late in the fifteenth
century, when it still was a modified
pillion, a great construction of iron,
wood and leather, padded, pillowed
and decorated. You will have to
come down to the eighteenth century
before you find the side-saddle in
anything like its present form.
“The ladies astride saddle is
growing in favor in all parts of this
country. Many ladies affirm that
the old side-saddle is out of date,
unsafe and not to be used by the
twentieth-century woman. In my
boyhood days the girls on the farm
never used the side-saddle, and rode
astride the same as the boys, and
often without any saddle at all.
“Here in Chicago the astride sad
dle is used by many of our 400. On
an afternoon in Lincoln Park the
bridlepaths are largely used by
women riding in man fashion.
“A few days ago, a woman medi
cal missionary, leaving this country
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
for Persia, bought a saddle, but not
a side-saddle.”
CLEAR AND STRONG.
I am in favor of Mr. W. S. Wil
liams’ plan for raising campaign
funds and am ready at your call to
send you my $3.00 a year for this
purpose. Yours truly,
V. G. HALL.

THE FOREIGN MISSION CRAZE.
Dear Sir: —I enclose some clip
pings from Texas Christian Advo
cate relative to collections for mis
sions. You are aware Texas people
have had a drought that has visited
almost every section of our State
and many will this year suffer be
cause of a lack of money to buy
the necessaries of life and comfort.
Amidst these conditions we find our
ought-to-be public benefactors urg
ing their sub-agents to work hard
and collect closely the pledges they
obtained by persuasion when times
were more promising. Many people
will be persuaded to give away their
small change -when their just debts
will go unpaid and their families in
want.
I think you have been doing one
of the greatest works of your life
in exposing this graft. Certainly
you have made friends where you
had none before, and I seriously
doubt if you have lost any unless it
be some of those who have been in
this missionary grafting business.
Yours truly,
W. L. SMITH, M. D.
Dallas, Texas, Sept. 24, 1909.
Ed. Comment; The clipping re
ferred to was a published letter writ
ten by one of the missionary bosses,
demanding that the Texas churches
pay up the amounts assessed against
them.
What Bible foundation have these
“assessments?” What Scripture jus
tifies them?
The Protestant clergy appear to
have picked out of Leviticus, the
money-plank; and to have convinced
themselves that while the Levitical
code is no longer binding in the mat
ter of shaving, oyster-eating and
marrying widows, it does bind in the
matter of tithes.
WARNS “TOM” AGAINST
TROUBLE.
The Jeffersonian, Atlanta, Ga.:
Enclosed please find my check for
$2.50 to pay for the attached. Please
send me the August number of your
magazine.
Will you kindly inform me of the
date of the Congressional Record
that contains the vote of the Demo
cratic Congressmen who voted with
the Republicans to sustain the Can
non Republican House Rules?
The refrigerator car people carry
thousands of car loads of goods both
to and from this State, and they do
not pay a single cent of taxes, either
advalorem or an occupation tax, and
I would like to know how our laws
could be made so they would be
compelled to pay their share of taxes.
Is there any State in the United
States that compels them to pay
“Gfa, “Jeffersonian
taxes on interstate shipments on the
part that originates in the State, etc.?
Dear Tom, as sure as you are
bound to die, so sure as you going
to get it in the neck, and lots of
trouble, too, for the show-up of the
Foreign Missionary business lately.
For, Tom, the representatives of the
church stoned the prophets of old,
crucified the Christ, and persecuted
those who differed from them, and
you are no better than they who were
persecuted, and they are made of the
same clay. So, look out, for you have
stirred up the ire of this class of
people and you will hear from them
sure.
Tom, you are doing a world of
good in showing up the wrongs of
both church and devil, for we are
now badly in need of men with the
courage and ability to show up the
evils of the day. You are “cussed”
now, but you’ll get your full re
ward, bye and bye.
Yours truly,
L. S. LIGHT.

Yes, I’m hearing from them, sure
enough. Still, they hear from me
occasionally, too.
The vote inquired about was in
March last, upon the organization of
the House of Representatives, im
mediately after the fourth day of that
month.
ANOTHER LITTLE BOY TO WEAR
THE NAME.
Dear Sir: —On the 22d of last
April a bouncing boy came to glad
den our home. He being our first
boy we, of course, think him great.
Myself and wife being great ad
mirers of yours, could not think of
a name that would be equal to the
boy but yours, Thomas Watson.
Enclosed find check to pay sub
scription price to both your papers,
and let them come along to Thomas
Watson Hill, Byromville, Ga.
Many years ago, when I was but
a bare-footed boy, I heard you speak
at Canton, Ga. You gained my boy
ish confidence then, and what is
more, you have through fifteen years
of hard struggle strengthened that
confidence, and as a champion of the
common people’s rights you stand
an uncrowned king.
We love you because you are a
Georgian, because you stand un
flinchingly for the best interests and
freedom of our people, because you
stood solid when others sold out.
If not now, some day you will re
ceive your reward, because you are
right.
With best wishes for your success
and happiness, we are,
Yours respectfully,
(Mr. and Mrs.) HOMER HILL.

THIS IS THE WAY TO HELP.
My Dear Sir:—Please find check
for which send Weekly Jeffersonian
to the following named: H. D.
Reid, Bremen, Ga.; J. W. McClen
don, Bremen, Ga.
Mr. Watson, I believe this makes
eight subscribers that I have sent
in this month. I have had but little
time outside of my own office duties
—sweeping the office, bringing wa
ter, setting type, chasing down lo
cals, entertaining friends and kick
ing a 12x15 jobber—to give to your
papers, but it is as plain as your ar
ticles on Foreign Missions, that by
a little effort on the part of your
friends, you can be made to feel
good and all humanity benefited, by
giving your publications a little of
their time. I can see the fruit of your
argument, and I am ready to pledge
you twenty new subscribers during
the months of October and Novem
ber.
Yours for Home Mission, and let
the “pig-tails” carry their own skil
let. C. F. DODSON,
Editor The Gateway.

realized that I need their help.—T.

HOW TO HELP THE .JEFFER
SONIAN.
Dear Sir: —Some time ago some
friend (or enemy) began sending
me the weekly Jeffersonian, and
it comes with printed address like
a regular subscription.
At first I glanced at it and laid it
aside, next I looked it over and was
amused, and then I read it and be
gan to get interested, until now I
look forward to its coming with a
large degree of pleasure (and bene
fit).
I particularly delight in, and en
dorse the attitude of the Jeffer
sonian on the “Southern question,”
the “race question” and the “mis
sionary question.” The pointed
truths, so tersely stated, on all these
questions as expressed in the Jef
fersonian strike with such force
that I do not see how any sensible
man who loves his country, his race
and his religion, can fail to be con
vinced that you are absolutely right.
I enclose SI.OO for the Jefferson
ian to continue to come.

MORE FACTS ABOUT THE GEOR
GIA ASYLUM.
Dear Sir: —In the weekly issue
which reached me September 23d,
the Jeffersonian contained an article
by one George Martin, who believes
he knows something about the work
ings of the insane asylums. Now,
some of Mr. Martin’s suggestions I
approve of. One is that the employ
ees should have more pay. Head
attendants receive S3O a month, oth
ers under him S2O. Three attend
ants are regularly stationed on halls,
—generally two specials—making
five in all. On each hall there are
about fifty-five men patients.
Many employees at the asylum are
good men but have been derelict in
properly carrying on the duties as-
