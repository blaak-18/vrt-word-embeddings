takes The Jeffersonian, and he likes
Mr. Watson very much. I live in the
country, and like it all right. I have
blue eyes, light hair, and fair com
plexion. I will answer Delia Cog
gin s riddle: it was a watermelon,
and I think the answer to Grady
Mangham’s was “eight cats”. I
would like to hear from some of the
Post-Card Club. I will close, asking
some riddles: When is a fowl’s neck
like a bell? If you were invited out
to dine, and found nothing on the
table but beets, what would you say?

OUR DEBATE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l am a little
Sand Mountain (Alabama) boy, and
am anxious to join the Post-Card
Club. My father is a subscriber to
Watson’s Magazine, and my eldest
brother takes The Jeffersonian. I
enjoy reading both. I have a cousin,
about my age, who is named for Mr.
Watson. His name is Tom Watson
Crockett, and they call him “Tom
Watson”. Father and brother think
Mr. Watson the greatest man living.
I hereby accept challenge to debate,
through the columns of The Jeffer
sonian, with Louis Burton, of Craw
fordville, Ga. Subject: Resolved,
that Georgia should have compul
sory education. I agree to go by the
lules. My age is thirteen years and
ten months. I will take the affirma
tive side of this great subject, be
cause I think every State should
have compulsory education laws
Barnie Crockett, Henagar, Ala.
(You will both get your letters
ready for publication next week. You
are each entitled to 500 words, and
you must stick by the rules.)
COUNT THE PIGS.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l will answer
the riddle about the apple tree for
Eula Roberts: It bore an apple (one
apple). I will ask a riddle: My fath
er came in to breakfast; he was ask
ed, “How many pigs have you”? He
replied, “I will count them for you.
One, two, three, six, seven, eight”.
All that answer the right number I
will send them a post-card. I like to
go to school, and I am in the fifth
grade. lam ten years old. I have
one sister and three brothers. I live
in the country, and like it fine. Much
love to Daddy Jim and the Post-Card
Club.—Ree Chambers, Dawson, Ga.

Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come to
join your happy band. lam a little
girl, eight years old. I have black
hair, dark-gray eyes and fair com
plexion. I -am in the third grade,
but am not going to school now.
Mamma said that it was too far for
me to walk; and I study at home. I
go to Sunday-school every Sunday
that I can. My teacher’s name is
Cousin Junie Burke, and I dearly
love her. I won the prize for good
lessons, and it was a cute little
sleepy # doll. Now I will ask some
riddles: (1) You haven’t got it, you
don t want it; but if you had it you
wouldn’t take the whole world for it.
(2) What is it that is in timber, but
not in trees; in your arm, but not in
your leg? Hope that this will es
cape the waste basket. I close with
best wishes to Daddy Jim and the lit
tle readers.—Essie Burke, Rocky
Ford, Ga.
ANOTHER ALABAMA COUSIN.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Will you per
mit a little Alabama girl to join your
happy circle. lam fifteen years old,
have brown hair and eyes, and weigh
one hundred pounds. Papa takes
The Jeffersonian, and thinks there
is no other paper that equals it. He
also has a Tom Watson knife that he
thinks a lot of. Well, as this is my
first time, and I am afraid of
the waste basket, I’ll close by asking
a riddle: There was a man that had
no eyes; he went abroad to view
the skies; he saw a tree with apples
on it; he took no apples off it, and
left no apples on it. With best wish
es to The Jeffersonian, I remain,
Mana Fnley, Lincoln, Ala.

Dear Daddy Jim:—l am a little
stranger to you. lam ten years old.

girls and boys. My papa takes your
paper, The Jeffersonian. I like to
read it very much. I live near the
little town of Faceville. I would like
to answer some of the riddles in this

that Delia Coggins asked is a water
melon.—Your new friend, Louise
Fain, Faceville, Ga.

Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come
for the first time. I am a little girl
twelve years old. I live in the coun
try, six miles from Wetumpka. All
the trees are green, now, and the vio
lets are blooming. I like to hunt
violets. How did you all enjoy Eas
ter? My Papa takes The Jefferson

is a great admirer of Mr. Watson. I
will close, hoping to see my letter in
print. With much love to the chil
dren and Daddy Jim. —Hattie Smith,
Wetumpka, Ala.

A. J. Beasley is principal of our
school, and w r e like him fine. His
oldest daughter, Bessie May, has been
very ill with pneumonia, but I am
glad to say she is much better. As
this is my first attempt, will drop
out by answering and asking some
questions: Why is a guinea pig in
the kitchen like a house on fire?
The answer to Theo. Jones’ riddle is
a churn dasher; Mamie Lewis’ is a
wheel-barrow; Lee Ware’s is an egg.
I think the answer to Mildred Jef
ferey’s is the wind. Now, I will ex
pect a card from each of you, and
will send a card to any one who will
answer my question. With best
wishes to all. —Your Mississippi
friend, A. S. Black, Ecru, Miss.
ANOTHER GEORGIA GIRL.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Will you please
make room in your happy band for
a Georgia girl? How many of you
children like to go to school? I do.
Our school closed last Friday, and I
sure was sorry. I will describe my
self: I have dark hair, fair com
plexion and blue eyes. I go to Sun
day-school every Sunday, and to
preaching too. I help Mamma in the
house and also Papa in the field.
How many of you children went to
an Easter egg hunt? I did, and we
sure did have a fine time. My school
teacher’s name is Miss Louise Lang
ford. She is from Camak, Ga. She
sure is a good teacher, and I like her
very much. You children sure do
ask funny riddles. I guess I had
better close, for fear this will reach
the waste-basket. Here is a funny
riddle: Irene and Elizabeth, Betsy
and Bess went across London Bridge
to hunt birds’ nests. They took out
one apiece. How many were there
left? To the first one that answers
my riddle, I will send a pretty post
card. Hoping to see my letter in
print.—Your friend, Rena Mae Shel
ton, Norwood, Ga., R. F. D. 1.
MORE FROM ALABAMA.
Dear Daddy Jim:—My father
takes The Jeffersonian and I like to
read the boys’ and girls’ letters. This
is my first attempt to write, and I
hope it will not reach the waste
basket. I have one brother, two sis
ters, and am thirteen years old. My
father is a farmer and we have about
sixty little chickens. I will answer
■ Mildred Jefferey’s riddle: It is the
wind. I will ask a. riddle: What is
it that never killed anything and yet
slew twelve? The first one that an
swers this will get a pretty post-card.
With best wishes to The Jefferson
ian and its many readers.—Lillian
Floyd Alston, Magnolia, Ala.
HOW AND WHY?
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come
for the first time. I live in the coun
try on a farm, and like farm life fine.
I am eleven years old, have black
hair, and dark eyes. I go to school
at Pine Grove, but it is out now.
We raise chickens, ducks, and tur
keys. I will close, asking some rid
dles: How can a man make his
money go a long way? Why are a
pig and a tree alike? I will close,
as this is the first time, -with best
wishes to the Post-Card Club.—Lou
ise Sturkey, Leverette, Ga.
