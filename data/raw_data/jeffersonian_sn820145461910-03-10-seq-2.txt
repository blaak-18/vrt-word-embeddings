ABUSES OF THE BANKRUPTCY
LAW.
At a recent session of Congress a
bill was introduced to establish “a
uniform system of bankruptcy
throughout the United States”.
Probably no law ever created for
the relief of people of the United
States has been so shamefully abused
as that relative to bankruptcy.
Dickens, in several of his w r orks,
has acquainted us with the horrors
of the debtors’ prison, and we are
told that the elder Dickens was more
or less a sufferer from the abuse
many creditors practiced on their
debtors, and had been imprisoned
several times for debt.
In the United States the abuse
grew to tremendous proportions, and
Ludlow Street Jail, in New York City
was the scene of many tragedies,
when imprisonment for debt was pos
sible.
The bankruptcy law was drafted
with two ends in view: one to make
it possible for an honest man to work
and pay off, at least in part, the in
debtedness he had incurred, at a rate
to be determined by the Bankruptcy
Court; the other, to prevent a credit
or from harrassing a debtor so that
he could not resume business.
To the honest business man who
has failed through no fault of his
own, the bankruptcy law has been a
blessing of immense proportions,
but there have been others who have
taken advantage of it, just as there
are alwmys those who will seize any
opportunity to get out of responsi
bilities, and this latter class is grow
ing.
The law itself has also provided
many excuses for generosity with
other people’s money and goods,
some States having an elaborate sys
tem of receivers, trustees, adjustors,
all of whom must be paid fees, and
the creditors, as a rule, are not bur
dened with any very great dividends.
Some merchants have deliberately
planned to “go into bankruptcy” and
to that end have first established
their credit, then bought heavily,
overstocking in every line, forcing
sales—and then “applying to the
court and praying for relief” from
their debts.
In one town there are two fami
lies related; one family consisted of
the husband, wife and four children.
The husband “went into bankrupt
cy”. After adjustment of the debts,
the business was resumed in the
name of the wife; in due time she
also “failed”.
After this adjustment the busi
ness was resumed in the name of
each of three of the four children.
By this time it is supposed the
head of the family had accumulated
enough money (and goods) to run
the business in an ordinary manner,
and at last reports was “doing busi
ness at the old stand”.
The other branch of the family
was smaller in number, but as far as
it was able followed the same tac
tics.
This plan might not have been
successfully worked in any other
State, but it proves conclusively the
need of a universal bankruptcy law
which will protect the debtors, but
protect the creditors also.
There are many other ways by
which the bankrupt evades payment:
“preferred creditors” often turn out
to be very close kin whose power to
extend credit might be questioned.
A law with the possibilities for
relief that the bankruptcy law pos
sesses should not be permitted to be
abused in the States where it has
become so important a factor of
commercial life.

Savannah (Georgia) is finding it

A young bank clerk whose salary
was sl2 per week is arrested on the
charge of $40,000 shortage which he
lost at cards. He plaintively asked:
"What could a fellow do on sl2 per

play faro successfully, anyway.

The shop windows, the calendar

Prohibition isn’t hurting liquor
importations into the United States
so as you could notice it. In 1909
the sum of $26,000,000 was placed

recorded for ten years previously.

Queer how suspicious some people
are about widows: a dear friend of

Quite a thrilling melodrama
might be written about this Pinchot-
Ballinger affair. “The pa-a-apers”
figure in it most dramatically, not to
mention the Lost Letter, the Villain,
and the Money. Maybe it is of such
stuff the “great American drama” is
te be built.

Foreigners regard the Americans
with awe, especially when it comes
to their matrimonial relations. It is
never safe to ask a visiting American
how his wife is, the foreigner avers,
until one sees the lady and recog

when he made the inquiry.

High officials in the political and
religious world have been having a
hard time of it lately. Many a fat
office is now graced by another head,
and the Grand Lama of Thibet is
about to be classed with Castro.
After centuries of mystery, Thibet is
found to be a very dirty and unde
sirable place, and with the depart
ure of mystery went the Lama’s job.
The Senator Pro Tern, from Mis
sissippi had a lot more fun out of his
short term of office than his prede
cessor had; after delivering a speech
which will go down in history as a
gem of its sort, he gave a theatre
party to all his colleagues and their
families. James Gordon may prove
to be an expert Senatorial pipe-layer.

My, my! here’s that nice, lady-like
body known as the D. A. R. in print
again because of squabbles. Young
woman won’t give up job from which
she has been “fired” and says the
reason of her being ousted is be
cause her mother campaigned for
votes for the lady who didn’t win
the presidency of the order. Sounds
like real politics, doesn’t it?

It may be that deputy sheriffs will
have to learn music. At a sheriff’s
sale recently, bidding on a piano was
very slow. Some one asked for a
tune and one of the deputies played
a few. From “Rock of Ages” to
“Georgia Camp Meeting” the price
rose, but when the deputy played
“Wearing of the Green” an Irishman
forgot his frugality and gave SIOO
for the instrument.

Hypnotism and moving pictures
figured in the police reports the past
week. Five boys tried to wreck a
train as they had seen robbers in a
picture play do. Several people in
Pittsburg parted with their money
and valuables while under the “hyp
notic” gaze (aided by a very shiny
revolver) of a smooth young man.
Immediate crusades against moving
pictures and hypnotists are now in
order.

Judge Landis has sentenced a
man to a fine of $15,000 and six
years in the penitentiary. The man
didn’t kill any one, but he sold oleo
margarine for butter. Awful; now
if Judge Landis could only be put
on the job of trying some man guil
ty of crimes against humanity,
which has been paying rather heavy
toll in lives lately, some of us would
feel more hopeful for the future of
the old Ship of State. »

Atlanta isn’t going to encourage
the brand of salvation which depends
on women going into saloons and
barber shops for its support. A so
called “Salvation Army” band which
has been operating for several years
seems to have started as a rival to
the original Salvation Army, and the
graft grew too apparent; the police
have been warned to prohibit the
women from soliciting and it looks
now as though the “Army” will have
to go to work for a living.
