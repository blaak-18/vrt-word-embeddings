R. F. Bloatert Woodworth, Wins .,
writes to the Orange Judd .atmer: My on
hen house illustrated herewith is 16xt bui
feet with a1 foot posts. This gives two 1
stories with as much Boor room above rid
as below. It stands on a stone under- an,
planing laid up solid with mortar. Th
Each story is divided into two rooms, - the
one 16x16 feet. the other 8x16 feet. The a
lower foor is of -clay and is raised 8 net
inches higher than the level of the go
ground putside. This insures its per- thi
feet dryness and in fact it is dusty di:
every day in the year. The 16x6 room
below is the roosting, laying and feed- do
ing room. WVhen the ground is not mi
frozen they are fed outside. The 8x16 lo
room is the sitting-room or hatchery. op
It is often used for other purposes. For an
instance as soon as cold weather came. tr,
we put in three stolen broods about ja
a quarter gown. It was a nice place th.
for them and they were better separat- ca
ed from the rest. The outside door of
this sitting-room opens into a yard. 10
16x24 feet, closed by pickets. So when gr
,a few cockerels are kept over to be
slaughtered for the table, the hatch
ing-room and yard make a convenient
place for them. The upper floor is
divided into the same sized rooms as
those below. The large one is used in
winter for what might be called a
calisthenic gallery or exercising room.
An inch or more of sawdust covers the
floor. - If "tailings" are fed, some are
scattered on the sawdust. Ear corn is
usually kept on the floor all the time Tm
for the hens to pick at. They seem i
to enjoy themselves scratching in
the sawdust. During. summer the rt
hens use it more or less to lay in, a few li
loose boxes with nest eggs being placed ,
around the sides. The 8x16 room above
is used as a storeroom and in winter is
a good place to jail broody hens In
summer a rectangular coop twelve feet
long and three feet wide is used for e1

my chicken-house, and the hens keep
themselves free from body lice by dust- i
ing. Neither-is there any leg scale dis- I
ease among my fowls, nor have they I
ever had cholera. My argument in
brief is a perfectly dry dirt floor, plen- i
ty of room and plenty of dust. 1 never
set hens until June and want the chick
ens hatched in July. Hot we-ather is
just the thing for them. At five months
old the pullets are laying and continue
to lay throughout the winter. The
profit is in the eggs.
TIMELY SUGGESTIONS.
Hlow lRoads Can Ite Mlade Good In a Fea
Years.
Good roads can be made in the fol
lowing manner: G(rade them to about
two feet in the center; cut a ditch on
each side of road: put tile in it large
enough to carry water from same: cut
your ditch not over two feet, deep;
have a good outlet for your tile and
your road will be dry.
,Now haul sand, gravel or crushed
stone, whichever is the nel:rest to your
roan1 hIaul two loads on top of otach
other. Lenve half of road bare so
people can drive on it when weather is
dry.
W\here there is sand or gravel within
five miles of the road it can he put on
Sat small expnse. Four mnills on every
dollar of valuation for tire years will
t pay for it, or twenty mills in all: four
mills on the doll-r the fanrmer would
not feel very much. and in tire years
d he would have all good roads.
k iet every lanldowner or taxpayer
i, haul at the rate of SI. 0 a day for team
f and driver in sutmer atnd autumn,
p when the roads are dry, say three
a weeks and three loads a day, and in
five years all roads will be good. T·et
those who have no teams payv for their
hauling.--C. L. Meinzer, in Farm, Field
and Fireside.

COIIse rtroleumn on Roosts.
Crude petroleum should be applied to
the roosts occasionally, in order to
Kuard aginst lice. During tihe few

winter, with the animal heat of the
bodies of the henPs t he house will
Ssometimes be warm enough to enable

LAROE FARM BARI.
tr
The manure gutter is 16 inches wide, 8 .
inches deep at one end, and 8 inches at a
the other end, with a conducting spout at
running to the manure pile, where the
liquid manure can be run into a reser
voir if needed. The gutter is covered
with strips of strong timber lxl3 inc- of
es, and placed 11- inches apart. They bh
are made into doors opposite each stall
so that they can be raised up to be
r cleaned. There is also a board, 10
inches wide, nailed on the side of the
gutter, under the hind feet of the ani
mals, thus making the gutter, or drain
age rather, really 26 inches wide. This
kind of gutter has many advantages
over the open drain. The cows are
kept as clean as possible, we think; w
and there is no danger of a cow, heavy tl
with calf, being injured by stepping
backward into the ditch. The ditch so
receives all the water and a great deal q
of the manure, which is tramped a
through; and it can be cleaned out a
every other day. iT
The horse stable is 17 feet wide and a;
36 feet long and 8 feet high, di-. e
vided into five 5-foot stalls and one
box stall. The floor is graded so as to n
a slope back behind the middle of the u
stall into a shallow gutter. They are s
all fed from the barn floor. C
r The barn floor is 18 feet wide, 36 feet it
long, and 14 feet high to loft. It is u
laid double: the floors overhead are e
e single. There is a platform 8 feet high t]
g running across the rear end of the'
a floor. Under this platform at one end
1, is the cistern; at the other end are the
stairs to the loft. Under the middle of
e the platform is a door 10 feet wide to g

so THE ART OF BREEDING.
1i To Ma.ter It It etiPreo slltelligence and
hlard Work.
in It seems poor economy for farmers
.n to attempt to pose as breeders and es
fy tablis)h a herd of thoroughbreds on the
ill simple knowsledge of hlow to feed hogs
ur for market, yet hundreds of men are
id doing it annually. As a rule, unless
.r they are men who have that spirit in
them that will not submit to a failure,
er they generally retire from the business
m tihe second year. To become a
n, breeder means more now than it did
ee year-s ago, says the Swine ih-ceder.
in The business has advanced, it is out of
et sight of the time in which the owner
ir ship of a pig sired by a prize winner
Id signified the breeding of fine stock. To
do this a knowledge of the entire
science is necessary. One must know
pedigree, the standard, feeding and
management, and these he must know,
not as his forefathers, but fully up to
,t the advanced knowledge of the active
men of to-day. The signs of the time
t in everything point towards a record.
iot In the breeding ring as in the speed
ring. to be a success one must have a
if record and that record must mark
vd high. The best records in the speed
ring a-e made in front of the pneu
of matic sulkies. The best records in the
the breeding ring are made by those who
employ every means to obtain knowl
get edge: no one can to-day make much
ten proress in the science of breed unless
ar- he takes advantage of all moans that
are now offered for studying the busi
a ness and.acquiring the work of the
is past vears, and upon that foundation
I-n build up a business that will be in har
is mony with the standard and progress
ins of the times.
er's onomy Is Feeding.
When dairymen feed for quantity
and quality they will get better re
I to turns from sales thtan when they try to
to economize the feed and let the result
bew be what it'may. It is t.he profit of
r in each dollar's worth of feed that a
the dairy cow makes, and the more feed
till we can get her to eat the more profit
ble we get. The liberal feeder, who looks
lng to the comnfort of his cows, that they
hat are well sheltered and well watered, is
pe sure to procure liberal returns for all
1the care he eq bestow upon theq.

What to do with Milk Pails I
Clean them with Pearline. You can't get
them so thoroughly sweet and pure in any
other way. Besides, it's easier for you
· ~ quicker, more economical.
" The box and barrel churn are not hard
to keep clean. A little hot water and a little
Pearline will clean any churn or do away
with any bad odor."- The Dairy World, Chicago.
Perhaps you think that some of the imita
tions of Pearline, that you'd be afraid to
use in washing clothes, -would do just as
well in work like this. They wouldn't
hurt tinware, certainly. But they wouldn't
clean it, either, half as well as Pearline-besides, "don't
play with the fire." If your grocer sends you an imitation,
be honest-send it back. 400 JAMES PYLE, New York.
