POOR CONSOLA TION.
The primar last Saturday did not give
the resuln: expected to the leaders of the
faction t8 t ordered them. The one who
expected to receive the most votes came out
last on the hlt.-Lafayette Advertiser.
If Bro. Van der Cruyssen can
draw any consolation from the re
sults of the itrimaries of the 14th of
December he is certainly entitled
to it all.
In 1892, after the hottest cam
paign in the history of Louisian$,
the vote received by both Foster
and McEnery was x6z8. It is con
ceded that a full vote was polled.
Adding the 40 votes cast for Breaux
--and Leonard the vote in x892
amounts to £668. Allowing an in
crease of say 75 voters we have in
this parish to-day 1743 voters. On
the r4th of December both candi
dates for clerk received r189 votes,
leaving 554 ballots uncast. Believ
r, gýrgtt every one of the 1x89 per
:isons who4oted is a Dcmocrat and
will vote the straight Democratic
ticket in April, (as The Gazett'pwill
not insult those who voted at the
primaries by questioning their party
fealty) and believing that at least
one-half of the 554 who did not vote
en the 14th, and who are all Demo
ea~ts with the exception of the 40 who
oted for Breaux and Leonard, will
ast their votes for the regular nom
inees of the party, thus leaving to
The Advertiser's friends 277 voters
as the maximum 4f, their following
in this parish. Reasoning on this
basis, which is a fair demonstration
of the results in April, the majority
of the regular nominees will be 962.
And in the face of these figures
'The Advertiser is feeling jubilant!
Your philosophy, Bro. Van der
Cruyssen, is superb. It is only
equalled b ghat of the marn who
had only one shirt. This man, we I
are told, had hung his shirt on the2
fence to dry. Suddenly his little 1
'boy ran in the house and said in an
excited manner: "Papa, the cowI
has eaten your shirt !" With stoict
;indiffegence he replied: "Nothing,
my son, a man who las property
.mtust expect to lose some." A man
who has votes must expect to lose
them, thin'ks The -Advertiser. .

The Republican State aCetral'
Comhamittee has issued asn . to
the people of Louiia. Thie Ga
sette. has always -contended that
Louis(lna Republianism did not
and could not mean anything but
negro supremacy. Three are, no
doubt, many white Republicans--a
few of whom are excellent gentle
men living in this parish-who are
opposed to the supremacy of the
black race, who are adherents to
that party because they believe in
its doctrines of protection an.d cen
tralization, but, unfortunately, those
men have jittle or no influence in
the councils of tre party, a fact
which is made clear by the charac
ter of the address of the State Cen
tral Committee.
We have read this Republican ad
dress to "the peo le of Louisiana"
and we dare say that for rank im
pudence and as an appeal calculated
to arpse the passions and preju
dices of the.negro, it will compare
favorably with any address ever is
sued by the Radicals during the
palmiest days of reconstruction.
This remarkable address is full of
niger. It is nigger here, nigger
there, nigger everywhere. There
isn't a word about the white man in
this whole niggery document. I:
should be read by every white man
in Louisiana, for it will show, better
than anything else what we are to
expect of the Republican party
should it get control of the State
government. It should convince the
most skeptical that a white man has
no business in the Republican party
as it is constituted in Louisiana to
day. It is for the nigger first, last
and always. In short, it is in favor
of putting the black man on top and
the white man under.
The outraging of white women by
negro brutes is one ot the themes
that the committee dwells upon. It
denounces, in bitterest terms, the
good white people for lynching the
black monsters who are guilty of
the most horrible of all crimes. The
Republican party of Louisiana is
guilty of many things to be ashamed
of, but taking up the cudgel for the
dusky ravisher is the most villainous
of all its infamies. According to
this address it would be their policy
to hang or send to the penitentiary
every white man who would dare lay
his hands on a black ravisher of a
white woman.
There is in the parish prison of
Orleans a negro under sentence of
death for the deliberate and unpro
voked assassination of a white po
liceman. This negro is the no
to,ious "Greasy Jim," who would
have been hung years ago had jus
tice been meted out to him. Be
cause this red-handed murderer is a
negro and his victim is a white man
the interference of the federal
courts in his behalf is warmly en
dorsed. The Republican committee
is not satisfied with defending negro
ravishers of white women, but it
volunteers its assistance to negro
murderers of white men.
The committee is also especially
desirous of compelling white ladies
and white men to ride in the same
cars with negroes, regardless of the
odoriferous qualities of the African
lily and thl mid-summer he-coon on
a warm Jury day. The anti-misceg
nation law is denounced and the
inter-marriage of the two races is
approved.
The suffrage amendment, whose
adoption means the disfranchise
ment of the bulk of the negro voters,
is fiercely attacked. The right of
he negro to vote is held sacred,
when it is an established fact that
with a pint of rot-gut whisky the av
erage negro voter can be bought
half a dozen times. I

of the Repu-blican party in Lduis

THE cA.sE OP DUDOoUSSAZ.
N. O. States.
Tbi* refusal of Gov.. Foster, after
a t otough and patient investiga
tiouj-to grant a reprieve to Nama
Dntdoussat. one of the convicted
aldermen of the city, appears to
have harrowed up the feelings of a
number of persons, who have be
seiged the Chief Executive with tel
egrams protesting against his action.
The Times-Democrat this morning
printed a number of these dis
patches, and to say the least of it
they are actually insolent in their
tone, The Governor of Louisiana,
however, is nut a man to be bullied
or driven out of any course his judg
ment may prompt him to take. He
has been grossly abused on one
hand for taking time to consider the
merits of the application of the con
victed alderman, and to inquire into
his power to deal with it; and now,
having done his whole duty, he is
to be roundly abused on the other
hand for doing what he believed to
be right. Gov. Foster canface this
double assault from contradictory
quarters. He has decided the ques
tion and the result is that the miser
able convict must serve his term in
the penitentiary.
,For this creature we have not one
particle of sympathy. Fur misery
and want and sorrow and suffering
and misfortune our heart always
goes out in pity; but never for the
criminal. It has been urged that
Dudoussat is not a man of fine intel
ligence, and hence that he has claims
upon the compassion of his fellow
citizens. But want of intellect is no
excuse for criminal acts. Human
justice must deal with the criminal
without the least mercy. Heaven
alone is the judge who can forgive
or condone acts of criminality.
Dudoussat was perfectly well aware
of the nature of the crime for which
he is now to serve a term in the pen
itentiary; he knew that he was ac
cepting a bribe, and he knew that
to accept a bribe is a violation of
the law. He knew that he was be
trayic.g a sacred trust confided to
him by his fellow citizens, and he
knew that if 1e were caught he
would be punished. There is not a
single ground on which a petition
for clemency can be laid.
But while we have no pity for the
criminal, for his unhappy wife and
children, we have the sincerest sym
pathy and the depth of that sympa
thy is as the measure of condemna
tion of him. When a man aban
dons honor and truth tor a criminal
career, dragging down his innocent
wife and children, he is to be doub
ly damned, and all human pity and
sympathy are due to them and not
to him.
In this matter Gov. Foster has
acted as an upright, fearless servant
of the people. If he had been un
der obligation to the Ringsters, he
would have been crowded into coin
pliance with their wishes; and in
deed they seem to have brought or
attempted to bring a tremendous
pressure upon him. But they utter
ly failed. The Ring and the Bosses
cannot dictate to Gov. Foster or
sway his judgment in any matter.
With them as well as w th all other
classes of his fellow-citizens Gov.
Foster will deal with equal and ex
act justice, and the claims of a fac
tion can no more deter him from
treating a city politician with justice
than the demands of the Bosses can
induce him to yield to their views
or prevent him from exercising what
political influence he can legitimate
vly exercise to secure this city first
class delegation to the Legislature.
G.v. Foster is in the saddle, and
those who seek to bulldoze him will
be apt to be ridden down.

Don't Plant Japan Rice.
As the time for planting is near
ing we think it well to say a few
words against the extension of the
culture of Japan rice. We are led
to do this as we find that there is a
considerable enquiry for seed of this '
description and it is evident that a
large number have an idea that the
re'sult of its cultivation has proven s
much more satisfactory than that
which has formerly been obtained
from the old-faphioned domestic
sorts. Our objectioa is that it is a
unlike th'e domestic aind when by
chance it is combined therewith,
depreciaths the value of the entire
baUlk.. J .Imighb seem extravagant to
liken the sntrt€duction of Japan seed
to the Canada thistle, still it has
been bad enough as it has resulted t
in a **mongrel rice,", neither one
thing nor the other. There have,
been exceptions where the onicome
was white, but iris genertally agreedd
that ninety per cent. is 6f loworder -
or more than one-half domestic red. t
-We have before us a letter from
Messrs. Dan Talmage's Sons, New ,
York, in answer to a request for
Japan seed by one of their planter k
friends in this locality. They say: ·
"Don't plant Japan rice." The dt
come as an entirety in this country
has been a fiat failure, and unless 4I
planters give it up they are simplyo
heaping up for themselves a lot of P
trouble for the future. The Japan b
rice rapidly degenerates when re
moved Irom the garden or hand
.€.
culture bihch it receives in its orn
-country. Home sorts are safe--home
sorts are best, and where one pros
pers by adopting foreign seed nine
others will come to grief the first
year and practically all by the sec
ond. Stick to either Honduras or
Carolina seed, of which the best is
none too good. These styles in
their best development certainly
give reasonable reward for labor ex
pended; witness results of the pres
r ent year in the Carolinas, where
planters are getting $3 and over per
barrel ror their best sorts; average
$zr.so, and instances rare where as
little as a have been realized.
BLAC KLJSTING U. S. SENA
TORS.
Times-Democrat.
The New York Sun of Saturday last In a
r local article, under the caption of "States
Misrepresented." says that "'the bankers
and merchants of New York City who have
extensive business relations with the bankers
and merchants of other States believe that
the time has come when at least twenty-four
United States Senators should be called to
account by their constituents for misrepre
senting them in matters of financial legisla
tion at Washington." The said bankers and
d merchants of New York t.ity, it would ap
pear, have received letters from some of the
I constituents of the twenty-four Senators in
question (sixteen of whom are Democrats
and eight are Republicans), which (letters)
state that the twenty-four Senators are de
liberately and willfully misrepresenting the
sentiments of the business men and others in
their States.
Here is a list of the twenty-four Senators
who, according to "the bankers and mer
cLants of New York" and their informers,
misrepresent their States in the upper house
of Congress:
DEMOCSATS.
Augustus O. Bacon, of Macon, Ga.; term
expires March 3, 1901
William B. Bate, of Nashville, Tenn.;
term expires March 3, 189g.
James F. Berry, of Bentonville. Ark.;
term expires March 3, 1901.
Joseph S. C. Blackburn, of Versailles,
Ky.; term exaires March3, 1897.
Wilkinson Call, of Jacksonville, Fla.;
term expires March 3, i897.
Horace Chilton, of Tyler, Ten.; term ex
pires March 3, g901.
Francis M. Cockrell, of Warrensburg,
Mo,; term expires March 3, 1899.
John W Daniel, of Lynchburg, Va.; term
expires March 3, IS99.
James Z. George, of (arrolltown, Miss.;
terms expires March 3, 1899
Isham G. Harris, of Memphis, Tenn.;
term expires March 3, 1901.
John T. Morgan, of Selma. Ala.; term ex
pires March 3, 1901.
James L. Pugh, of Eufaula, Ala.; term et-.
pires March 3, 1897.
William N. Roach, of Larrimore, N. D.;
term expires March 3, 1899.
George G. Vest, of Kansas City, Mo.;
term expires March 3, 1I97.
Daniel W. Voorhees, of Terre Haute,
Ind ; term expires March 3. 1897.
David Turpie, of Indianapolis, Ind.; term
expires March 3, 1899.
IEPUBLICANS.
Lucien Baker, of Leavenworth, Kan.;
term expires March 3, 1901.
James Donald Cameron, of Harrisburg,
Pa.; term expires March 3, 1897.
John H. Mitchell, of Portland, Ore.; term
expires March 3, 1897.
George C. Perkins, of Oakland, Cal.;
term expires March 3, 1897.
Richard F. Pettigrew, of Sioux Falls, S.
D.; term expires March 3, 1901,
Henry C. Hansborough. of Devil's Lake,
N. D.; term expires March, 1, x897.
Francis E. Warren. of Cheyenne, Wyo.;
term expires March 3, 1901.
Clarence E. Clark, ot Evanston, Wyo.;
term expires March 3, 1899.
Now "'the bankers and merchants of New
York" who, it needs scarcely be remarked,
do not accord to the twenty-four Senators in
question the same freedom of opinion and
judgment in the matter of finance as they ar
rogate to themselves, insist that the constitu
ents of the said twenty-four Senators shall,
either through the Legislatures of the States
they represent or through the boardsof trade
and the chambers of commerce in the cities
of these States, demand of these twenty-four
Senators "that they cease misrepresenting
them in matters of financial legislation at
Washington and come out hearty and strong
for sound money."
Indeed, if the constituents of the twenty
four Senators do not adopt some such action
of disciplining their Senators as "-the bankers
and merchants of New York" are pleased to
dictate, such of the constituents of the twen
ty-four Senatrs as have business relations
with the goldbug **bankers and merchants"
of the East are threatened that they shall
not receive very much consideration in the
matter of credits with New York and East
ern merchants generally.
Senators from eighteen different States of
the Union are on that black list of ,'the
bankers and merchants" of New York;
and it is something new in the political his
tory of the United States that a set of men
in the East, for no other reason which we
know than that they have some money,
should in such a barefaced and brazen way
attempt to coerce the political opinion and
action of United States Senators-and of
Senators from eighteen States, too! What
do "the bankers and merchants of New
York" take themselves to be anyway that
they should dare to embark on such an op
pressive and dictatorial crusade ? Do they
think that, because they are better fixed in
this world's goods than the constituents of
the twenty-four ~Senators, they can compel
these.onstituents to do such dirty work as
they ("the bankers and rierchaants-of New
York~"') 'lave upaped out for them ? We
very mnuh mistake the spirit of the cnsttadt.
-nts of the 'enty-four Senators, if they shall
tolerate any such dictation or put up with
any :stchmpertinent political interference,
from any, coterie of men, rich or poor, in
North, East, South or West.
The Times-Democrat does not profess to
know the political relations between Senators
and constituents in all of the eighteen States
which are said to be misrepresented-they
will no doubt be spoken to by those who
know accurately; bat we do happen to know
that the statement in which Senator George
of Mississippi is said to misrepresent his peo
ple in financial legislation is a stupidly false
statement. The informer supplied "the
bankers and merchants of New York" with
the following:
**Geo, ~, f M~ississipi, i " another _ena
tar who misrepresents the fiamacial views of
the voters of his State. The cotton factors,
lamber exporters, and the growers ofl .e.
corn and cotton, know' that George's silver
views do not represent the great business in
trests of Vicksburg. Natchez, Columbus
and Jackson, and other thriving communi
ties in the State."
This is dimetrically opposed to the truth.
Mississippl is perhaps the silver State par
excellence of the Union. Of her 66 coun
ties, there are not six which have not de
slared in favor of silver. And If goldbug
statements be so far removed from the line
of veracity in the case of Mississippi. what
on the es-ano-disce-omnes principle, is likely
to be the precise market value of the gold
bug statements with regard to the other
seventeen States "misrepresented" by thewr
Senators ?
