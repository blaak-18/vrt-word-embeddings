People's Party Candidate
FOR CONGRESS
OF THE FOURTH CONGRESSIONAL
])ISTRICT OF LOUISIANA,
HON. B. W. BAILEY,
OF WINN.
Which is Best ?
The People's party has a candi- I
date in four of the Congressional I
districts of Louisiana, and will in
all probability have one in each 1
district, while the Democrats will
also have one. A marked distinc- i
tion between the People's party and t
the Democratic party is, that each t
candidate in the People's party ]
stands squarely pledged to a plat- f
form that demands the free and t
unlimited coinage of silver at the a
ratio of 16 to 1, in such plain and 'I
unequivocal terms that there is no c
room for dodging, or even equivo- p
eating. The same platform pledges a
them to the abolition of national si
banks, (the greatest curse of the h
country) and the restoration and w
control of the volume of money to ti
the government, and that, that vol- tl
ume hbe increased to fifty dollars a]
per capita by supplimenting the ti
free and unlimited coinage of sil- at
ver with an issue of greenbacks. ti
Every People's party man in the tt
United States is pledged to see O
these laws enacted when the people al
get control of this great govern- D
ment. si
But when we come to examine fa
the Democratic side of the ques- hi
tion, we find all the candidates run- T
ning without being pledged to sup- B
port any measure under the sun. t
They are not responsible to anybody I'
fer their actions in Congr and SE
should they be elected, they will be I
free to take their own couree and
if it suits their taste they can vote in
with the trust, the gold-bug, or any tl4
ether corrupt concern, and when fr
easuaed they can with reson meet pj
the peple with the argument that fo
they were not elected on any plat- pe
form and therefore not bound to be
any particular course, and this ar- wi
gumnt is unanswerable. n
New think of this you American to
sitismos who have a vote to give. as
It will be muck better for you to of
take this into eonsideration somw be- by
fore the election and vote for the pa
man that is absolutely pledged to pa
krig about the needed reforms, me
tham it would be to discover your Og
erordaftsr the deed is done nd it Si
becoms too late to remedy it. on

Hon. H. W. Ogden's Speech.
=i
E Ioion. H . Ogdlen addressed
the citizens of Natchitoches on
SMonday. The civil court, Kpolice
jury and school board, all meeting
on that day brought out a consid
erable crowd, and when the meet
r. ing was called to order by ('ol.
Jack at 12 o'clock there was ai
so large audience.
Mr. Ogden rehashed the old tar
iff talk seasoned with abuse of the
Republican party and the glories
of the Democratic party. lie pro
' ceeded to show (as he claimed) that
0 by the new Democratic tariff law
oo the people had been saved 9,. -
S(MNI,O000 a year by the free wool
schedule, but failed to state that
r the wool growers of the U(nited
" States had lost nearly that by the
decline in the price of their wool,
and he also failed to state that the
American wool growers had been
M forced to drive their sheep to the
slaughter-pen and have them butch
ered because they could not afford
to feed them for the wool they
produced-at the present prices.
He claimed that the manufactur
er's tariff on woolen goods had
been reduced to a considerable ex
tent, but he also failed to state that
the manufacturers profit under
L even the reduced tariff would be
greater with the free wool sched
ule, than it was before under the
tariff on raw wool; he also failed
to state that under the Democratic
L tariff the profit arising from the
tax all goes into the hands of the
- manufacturer and none of it into
, the hands of the wool grower.
I He admits that the two old par
h ties will not take up more than one I
I question at a time, and that it is I
not likely that the two great par
1 ties (Dem. and Rep.) will take up
i the money question until after 189fi.
That the Democratic party had no
free coinage plank (at a ratio of 16
I to 1) in its platform, but he hoped
and prayed that it would have.
This is as near as Mr. Ogden could
come i saying that the Democratic t
party was in favor of the free coin- r
age of silver. Mr. Ogden also P
stated that a political party that
had control of the government was
wholly responsible for the legisla- u
tion of that government, and that
therefore the Republican party was ti
alone responsible for the demone
tization of silver in 1873, and he
attributed the low prices and hard tl
times to a very great extent to
that infamous act. But our friend
Ogden never once opened his mouth ci
about the infamous action of the f
Democratic party in demonetizing -
silver in 1893, by which act the t
farmers of this country have lost b
hundreds of millions, of dollars. h
The Sherman law of 1890 was a
Republican law and did give us p
about fifty million dollars a year n
whel it was uaested, and even this s
small supply was cut off by the a
Democratic party.
Now we deem it very strange hi
indeed that this distinguished gen- fc
tlemen who poses as the farmer's a
friend should seek to keep so im- t&
portant a matter in the back ground bl
for no other purpose than that the fa
people should be mislead into the a
belief that the Democratic party i
was their friend. Such as this will w
no longer work, for the people are aI
too well informed to take it down se
as of yore. (Thanks to the system
of education now bemg conducted ei
by the People's party.) Why not i
put all questions fairly before the fa
people and let them as intelligent tb
men choose for themselves I Mr. ai
Ogden also berated three Populist x
Senators for voting for the bounty or
on sugar. Suppose for the sake N
of argument we admit that every cc
Popolist voted for it. According to th
Mr. Ogden's statement, about one- in
eighthof the sugar consumed be
thes United States is raised here and eq
thes other seven-sighths are im
ported. Which is better for tbe in
poor man of this coantry, to pay N
theim onty of tao ents a pound s
on m-neighth of thebs sugar he uses io
mad get the blame fsree duty or th
pay onsad a half ents a pound wi
to tbhe eger trusts on seven- all
eights  wht he mm t The poor a'
_m got his ms r heper usder o
the McKisl bounty thaen be does of
now under Democratic tarif. This th
tariff goes directly into the coffers
of the trust which the Democrats
aý claim to have '"shattered," but as
on IMr. HIavemeyer contributes more
ice liberally to the ixxxile fund than
ng the Louisiana sugar planter, this
id- tariff can be accounted for as an
Et- indirect way of forcing the people
il. to contribute to the oxxxlle fund of
a the I)emoeratic party.
Mr. Ogden admits the money
ir- conspiracy and that millionaires
he were made just after the war and
see by infamous legislation, but
o- charges it up to the Republican
at party. The infamous legislation
ºw referred to was passed in 1s65 and
.- amended in la6t;, the vote on that
of infamous legislation was as follows:
at For, 53 Republicans and 25 I)emo
Ld crats. Against, 53 Republicans and
be 1 Democrat. Now it can plainly
b, be seen who is responsible for the
be passage of that act to substitute
bn bonds for greenbacks.
Me Mr. Ogden from a Democratic
h- standpoint endorsed the Foster ad
rd ministration, andt urged the two
'y factions of the Democratic party
in the State to harmonize. Hle
r- failed, however, to say anything
id about the Cleveland administra
K- tion, therefore we may conclude
at that by his silence he endorses it.
Nr Now we want it distinctly under
e stood that we are not using this ar
:1- gument to the disparity of Mr.
ie Ogden in the primary election, for
ad as we have nothing to do with the
ic nomination of either gentlemen
ie that is now before the people for
te nomination. That is a political fight '
:o of their own. We claim that as I
Democrats, neither of them should
r- go to congress, but as to their
1e nomination we have nothing to
is say. I
S W'Wat Congress Has Done.
The Populists love to declare that the
Democrats did nothing during the re
o cent session of Congress. Something
was done, however, but we have not 1
seen a statement of what it was so con
d cisely made as the following by Congress
man Hall, of Minnesota. It is in a nut
shell but speaks volumes :
I It has made all money equally taxa
ble.
It has restored confidence in our cur
- rency and finances. e
It has given to all our people the op- a
portunity of living cheaper and better.
t It has shattered the protected trusts of
McKinleyism.
It has placed the burden of taxation
- upon the rich man's surplus as well as '
upon every man's needs.
It has restored the freedom of elec
tions.
It has placed the transaction of the
government and its methods of account
ing upon a business basis. n
It has greatly reduced expenditures of
the government
For one solid year it has maintained o
an unrelenting fight against the trust
and monopolies which protection has r
created.
It has fought the good fight, it has
finished the course, it has kept the faith. ti
º-Richland Beacon News.
Brother Machen, is this true ? Have
the Democrats done all this ? If not, c
show up the error, if so, what reason
have you for not returning to your old
home '-Progress. a
Now Bro. Hicks we are not pre- p
pared to say that the above does n
not strike us with some degree of v
surprise, coming as it does from a
man that has a two-fold advantage a
over us from the facts first, that he n
has been running a reform paper tl
for two years or more, and al
second, that he has remained inside i
the "party" and therefore ought to
be in possession of all the inside cl
facts, and it seems to us could have is
answered them better than we can, w
but, however, we will do the Ibest al
we can with the lights before us, ay
and in doing so we will take them om
seriatim. 11
1st. "It has made all money a
equally taxable." This requires ai
but very little attention for it is ce
false and misleading; it is false as, c
there is no taxation on the million- to
aires bonds nor the interest on the sa
bonds, neither is there any taxes
on the bank note issued by the '
National banks. Those bank notes
constitute the principal money of I
the country, therefore it is mislead- In
ing in trying to make the people
believe, that the Democrats favor
equal taxation.
2nd. "It has restored confidence
in our currency and finances."
Now this proposition is too absurd cr
and ridiculous to require any ser- dc
ious eonsideration. The masses of se
the people of this country has al- pa
ways had unlimited comidence in is
all mossy of the United States, of
and the cry of "lack of eonSdence" ac
only came from the distorted brain tic
of Cleveland and his asociates in be
Sthe crime of demonetizing silver. til
ors It is an absurdity to say that one
its kind of money is not as sound as
as another kind of money. Anything
reI that has a legal tender quality is
an money and there is no unsound
lis money, but it is all put upon the
in same footing in the measure of
le value. This power to measure
of value is controlled by quantity and
not by quality.
'Y ;3d. "It has given to all our peo
es ple the opportunity of living
id cheaper and better." As the Dem
ocratic party has taken the million
in aire hankers and trusts under the
"n protection of its mighty iwing, it
(d can truthfully say that it "has
it given our people the opportunity
s: to live cheaper and better," for the
- rich millionaire is the only class
d that has been benefitted by the leg
y islation spoke k i. This third
e proposition we ..upixse refers to
the chealpening of produce by the
repeal of the purchasing clause of
Lc the Sherman law : if so let us see
I- how it effects the class of people
o represented by the LO'ISIANA
y PoPUIlST-we mean the producers
:e I (the man who earns his living by
g the sweat of his brow). The cot
- ton planters of the South on a six
e million hale crop in 1.,93 and an
t. eight million crop in ls-94, have
lost on the two crops the enormous
sum of two Anndred and ten million
dollars. This enormous sum has
r been taken from the class of people
e we represent anil turned into the
a coffers of the class of people rep
r resented by Democracy. It has
t been taken from the food, clothing
s and education of the poor man's
children and been added to the
r vast wealth of the millionaire.
1 The reduction in the volume of
money brought about by the repeal
of the purchasing clause of the
Sherman law has put more of the
poor man's labor into the rich
man's dollar and therefore enabled
t him (the rich man) to live cheaper.
This is the class of men that the
Democratic Congress represented
and therefore we suppose that the
third proposition might be consid
ered correct, viewing it from that
standpoint.
4 th. "It has shattered the pro
tective trusts of `McKinleyism."
We suppose that this has reference
to "shattering" the coffers of the
"sugar trust" by stuffing forty
millions of dollars of the poor
man's money down its throat.
5th. "It has restored the freedom
of elections." Of course this has
reference to the Federal election
law repeal. Yes, but it has turned
the State elections over to a
"double triggered" election ma
chinery that can steal the votes out
of the ballot box faster than they
can be put in. Therefore this t
proposition means freedom to com
mit frauds instead of freedom to
vote.
Now as to placing the country on
a business basis it will only be
necessary to give a few samples of
the businwe basi:. Cotton selling J
at 4f cents per pound, wheat sell
ing at 35 cents per bushel.
The Democratic party took
charge of the National government
in 1893, and during that year there
were two hundred thousand failures I
aggregating three billion dollars,
against fourteen thousand sixty
one failures aggregating $321,236
119 in the year 1892, and it has
added' three million more to the
army of unemployed. If you can ii
call this a bwuinees barsi the Demo- r
crats have certainly succeeded. As
to decreasing expenses the record
shows the following :
It has burdened the people with a t
useless indebtedness of...... $O0,000,000
Five per cent per annum in- 1
terest.................. .. . ,500,000 i
Increase of pensions....... 5,891,108 p
Increase in diplomatic sala- a
$es. . .......2, :00
Increase in clerk hire for mem
bers ....................... 48,000 i
Total S08s,44G~60s
In addition to this the Demo- t
cratic Congress spent thousands of 1
dollars in extra mileage to them- .
selves, something that no other b
party had ever dared to do. This
is about all the results in the way
of expenditures we have on hand
now, but we are gathering statie- l
tics daily from the record and will
be able to give more soon, but un
til then Bro. Ilicks we hope this may o
ne he satisfactory to you as a lihbral
as man. Want of space will not per
ig mit us to say more now, however,
is we could like to do so. No, no,
td Bro. Hicks, we will not shut up
oe shop yet. but continue in the good
of work as long as we think we are
re right. You had better help us;

Normal lehool.
g In quest of something to inter
n- eat our readers, on Wednesd.y
morning we wended our way to the
1e Normal school, where we were cor
it dially received by Prof. T. 1).
i Boyd, the genial president of the
Y school, who kindly conductei us
ec through the various departments,
is where we were introduced to the.
- several teachers. We lingered
'd awhile watching each teach
:o er in his easy, and at the same
te time forcible and effective manner
f of instruction, which so far as we
* could judge, was perfect in all of
le! the details.
A This now famous school, opened
"s on Monday the 1st inst., with 275
y pupils, and the number is increas
t_ ing by daily arrivals. It now has
xa large increase over the attend
n ance of last year, and promises to
e be by far the most prosperous ses
sion of the school since its estab
lishment. Notwithstanding the
third grade model school is a pay
department, it is now crowded to
e its fullest capacity-this certainly
speaks well for the able manage
ment of this great State institu
tion.
The faculty consists of Prof. T.
D. Bcyd, president; Prof. A. L.
Smith, training teacher; Prof. R.
L. Himes, mathematics; Prof. E.
L. Stephens, latin ; Prof. B. C.
Caldwell, science; Miss Angus
Morris, history and literature; Mrs.
M. E. Johnson, drawing; Miss Lau
cy Bates, music; Mrs. L. C. Mc
1 Voy, language and literature; Mrs.
SEmma Oswald, third grade; Miss
Bessie Russell, second grade; Miss
1 L. J. Lawless, first grade; Mr. J.
E. Reedheimer, ungraded model
school.
In conclusion we can only speak
in the highest praise of the teach
era, and we cheerfully recommend
this great institution of learning
to those who realize the great im
portance of educating their chil-I
dren.

We are pleased to report that those t
that have been on the sick list are im
proving, and we trust and hope that
they will soon be out again.
Our Christian Association was highly
entertained last Sanday by a splendid I
essay read by Miss Lula Ethridge, and I
also one by Mr. Albert Jackson. The
Association is making many good Im
pressions in our community, and is fast
developing our local latent. We hope t
it may continue prosperous. a
Rev. W. T. Rowe, Baptist minister of
Gansville, preached a very interesting F
sermon at the Baptist church Monday a
night. We heartily welcome the good a
brother in our midst.
Miss Lucy Ragan, a highly cultured y
young lady of Montomery, who has a
been spending some time in Texas, has I
returned to her home to the delight of j
her many friends.
Judge Watkins, another Democratic
candidate for congress, after extensive
advertising came here on Friday 28th
inst., to make a Democratic speech, but a
as usual, failed to get an audience. The
Democrats have not had any thing new
to tell for thirty years, and thereforeI
the people don't care about taking any b
more stale food.
Cotton continues to decline, when will
it reach the bottom? The price has al
ready stagnated business, and it is now
a serious question as to how the farm
ers will meet their accounts and pay p
their taxes.
We have received notice that Maj. A.
L. Cox, of Leaky, Texas, will speak at
this place on Wednesday night, October c
17th, 1894, upon the reforms contained
in the People's party platform. . It will S
pay all to come and hear him, as he is
an intelligent and forcible speaker. The
speaking will be at night, and you will y
lose but little time from picking your
five cent cotton.
We attended a Baptist district meet- T
ing on Cane river last Sunday. Our T
trip was a very pleasant one indeed. g
The district meeting was a grand suc- T

elegant ehurch, and are establishing aI

II Buried Their Brother.
A tonlhinig event is reported
friom Mexico. Mo. 'Two chihltdren
,a boy of I i aind a girl of lii. ap

d cemetery drawing a little wagon
with them, iand told thle sexton that
.eI they had coniiic to bury their little
brother A.\ exanuiiaIion of thet

The children said that their oiithei

Y bury the dead child. The sextor
told them that he could not alloy.
the body to be buried without
permit, so they returned home,
coming hack the next day with thl
e necessary paper, and thile body war
s consigned to the potter's iehi. Th.
father was tfond to be a laborec
and. l too 4poor to give his deceaset
infant a decent burial.
All Are Being Reached.
e -
In this great reform mhoveimen
that is now swepcing the land, wt
e ind three classes of people to con
f tend with. The tirst are those wlh
carry their blrallls in their head.
this class the reform press are edu
cating everyday. The second class
are those who carry their brains in
their stomachs, and the third are
s those who carry their brains in
their pockets. These latter classes;
the trusts, ban kers and corporatioins
are reaching every day. Therefore,
we can say that the reform work is
gaining ground rapidly. Let her
z go Galigher.
Ridiculous.
Some of our Dlemocratic friends
are still sending up the usual wail
ing sound of "negro domination."
\We think if they will state facts
instead of misleading and inisguid
ing fancies, they will see that the
People's party is the only party
that has ever tried to forever set
tie the question of white suprema
Scy, and that the proposition was
directly rejected by the Democrats.
This old worn out subterfuge will
not avail thenm.
