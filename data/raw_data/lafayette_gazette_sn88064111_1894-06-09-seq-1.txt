A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE
B J. HAROLD MOLT.
[Copyright. 189, by the Author.]
T was in the
year 181.
S _ TI was snm
moned to the
I / great city by
iý my Uncle Rob
ert's old house
keeper,. Mary
Watson. I was
my uncle's fav
orite, and had
been led to. be
lieve I should
be the inheritor
of the greater
part of his
wealth. He was taken ill in January,
and being old and infirm, the severe
weather was too strong an antagonist
for the doctors to fight against, so they
gave up the contest and told Mary Wat
son she mnst lose no time in sending
for my father or myself, as his end was
near.
So the ill news traveled very slowly
to Bolt court in Yorkshire, our
home. Snow laid very deep that win
ter, and the coaches had great difficulty
in getting through their stages, espe
cially in the north, and it was four
days from the sending to the receipt of
the summons to the death-bed of my
uncle.
What a wearying jeurney that was;
stopping time after time at the post
houses while clearings were made in
the snow, horses falling, and wheels
clogged. A long dreary time of it we
all had. At last we saw the spires and
high roofs of London, standing. out
shrouded by the leaden sky. It was
dusk when we arrived in the city; and
leaving my traveling bag at the King
Lud inn, I hastened to my uncle's
house. He lived in Lambeth, in one
of the then good old houses at the rear
of the palace. So soon as 1 reached the
house I knew that all my haste had
been in vain, for death was written in
its face.
I found poor Mary Watson in deep
sorrow, anxioitly awaiting my ar
rival, for my uncle had died the pre
vious day. I talked long with Mary
concerning my uncle's illness, and
death, and was much touched by the
good creature's relation of his anxiety
to see me-to whom, by the way, he
had left all his property, with the ex
ception of a few legacies, not forget
ting his trustworthy old servant, Mary
-his living message to me when he
was passing away, and his great wish
to see me.
All this seemed very sad to me, for it
was my first experience of taking away
one dear to me, and when I saw his quiet
and careworn face marked in death,
I felt awed and strange. Athough Mary
pressed me to stay the night, I could
not; and, though tired, decided to face
the stormy night in preference to sleep
ing in the house tena nted by death. So,
wrapping my cloak round me, and bid
ding Mary good-night, I ventured on
my way to the city.
Have you ever experienced the pre
sentiment of coming evil? Nearly all
of us have some time in our lives. A
strange and strong feeling came over
me, and a warning voice whispered:
"Turn back; do not venture!" 1 was
half-inclined to listen and obey, and
the rain and wind beat on me as if to
drive me back; but I felt it was the re
sult of excitement and the surrounding
circumstances to one unaccustomed to
change, so, pulling my cap over my
face, I battled with the storm and
passed on.
On, on, I went, heading my way
through the sleet and driving wind.
The streets in those days were but
poorly lighted. Oil lamps few and far
between and candles set in the win
dows of houses abutting on the road
way were the only lights. Part of my
way lay by the lanes close to the river,
soME N0E WAS FOLLOWOING UE
by wharves, and sheds, and hovels
where the riverside workers lived. It
was just upon midnight, and 1 heard
amidst the roar of the storm the
watchman's voice calling out the hour.
Turning out of one of these by-lanes,
I became aware that footsteps were
following me. I could see no one, the
night was tod dark, but I heard these
footsteps gradually gaining on me. I
could not hurry, it was as much as I
could do to keep my footing on the
slippery stones and in the mud, but as
these footsteps came nearer and near
er and did not attempt to pass me I
felt evl accompanying them. At
last I stopped battling with the windd
and rain- A gleam from a lamp
sliowed me just for one moment a face
at my shoulder. It was but a Sask of
light that showed it me, but that fes
is photographed on. my memory-a hid
eous face with every feature and line
marked with villainy. and the blood
shot eyes hungry for prey. Suddenly
the man sprang upon me, and throwing
me dafwn. with my-face in the mud
pinioned my arms behind me. .I was
helpless. I sbouted1 but- the - oe e

lane at the corner of which we stood,
down a flight of steps and alonga dark
passage. Taking a key from. his pocket
he unlocked a door and pushed me in,
locked it, and dragged me up a broken
and uneven light of stairs. Arriving
at the top he unfastened another door,
and, holaing it open.. pitched me into
the room. There were steps into this
room, had I stumbled and fell headlong
on the floor. Cursing and threatening
that if I stirred he would kill me, I
heard him lock the door, descend the
stairs, and look the outer door. I sat
up and listened. All was dark as Ere
bus, not -a sound could I hear but the
storm. At last, after lying some min
utes, which seemed hours, I tried to
wrench the rope whleh tied my hands.
Fear gave me strength, and at length
I got my arms free, but the exertion
was too much for me; I fainted.
Comin. to myself. I.stood up, trem
bling and in pain. All was dark around
me, and I scarcely dare move, fearing
that I should fall into some treacherous
pit or trap. Thoughts few through my
mind of stories I had read of per
sons being kidnaped for the value
of their bodies for dissection, and I
wondered what object this fiend had
for thus imprisoning me.
With careful steps and hands out
stretched, I found the wall and felt my
way. It was damp, and as if of broken
plaster. At last J found a shutter sunk
in the wall, and I knew it must be the
covering to a window. Like -lightnting
my hands sought for the bar, and with
all my -strength I wrenched it down
and flung the shutter open, but to find
a small lead-framed window. With my
trembling hands I battered out some
panes, and found it opened on a narrow
and dark passage.
Hope strengthened me, and putting
my mouth close to the broken aperture
I called for help. My voice only re
verberated through the room. I listened
-all was still as death, but for the
creaking of the old tenement by thd
boisterous wind. Again I called and
listened. I heard a sound. Was it in an
swer to my call? No, it was in the room
-a strange, unearthly moan. I looked

round,and saw, by the faintglimmeroi
light that came across the room from
the broken window, a heap of some
thing on the floor, and knew by in
stinct that that something was a hu
man body.
Terror ran through me with an icg
shudder, and creeping across the floo
I looked nearer. It was the body of
woman. A shawl was thrown over
the head and shoulders, and I could
not see the face. Fear lent me cour
age, and stooping down 1 snatched the
covering from the face. Great heavens!
Murder had been done; the face.
once beautiful, was stained with
blood. I touched it, it was warm. I
spoke, I called, but it answered not,
nor moved. I realized momentarily
the plot into which I had been dragged.
The wretch had chosen me as a victim
to be accused of the murder which he
had committed. My head reeled, the
surroundings stupefied me. Rushing to
the broken window I again and again
shouted for help, breaking the broken
casement with my bleeding hands.
Would help never come? It seemed a
lifetime of torture. At last my ear
caught, amid the roaring of the
storm, the sound of a voice. Again I
called. Yes, it was an answer to my
call. A watchman had heard my cries
and came up the passage underneath
the window. I told him as well as 1
could from my prison, that I was
forcibly locked in and begged him to
get assistance and release me. He went
away. Again suspense. I dare not
move, I dare not look round on that
fearful sight again. At last I heard
the sound of many feet, the bursting
open of a door, the tramping upstairs,
then the door of my prison was broken
open, and a light, carried by the
watchman and his fellows, shone on
me. I told them how I had been
brought to the place, and explained my
adventure as well as my dis
traught brain would allowv me.
They examined the room and
the body of the woman whom
they found to be now dead. I was de
tained by them. After this all seems as
a dream to me. I recollect that I saw
a white-haired old gentleman there. I
remember a cell, a magistrate's court
and many faces looking at me. Then
I saw dear old Mary Watson, who cried
over me and took me in a coach to my
uncle's house. I learnt afterwards that
I had told my story in a rambling way
to the magistrate, and had mentioned
my coming up to London to see my
uncle before his death. They had also
found some letters upon my person cor
roborating my statements, and had
sent a messenger to the house and
brought Mary Watson. All this so
clearly proved the truth of my state
ments that I was released unpunished
by law, but carryig awvay with me the
burden of a shattered constitution.
The terrors of that night brought on
a severe illness and for days- I lay in
delirium, fancying myself a prisoner in

TAX THE RAILROADS.
How an Iowa Farmer Weaud Raise FWnds
for Road Improvement.
At the present time there is a general
demand for better roads and. particu
larly, better highways leading into our
principal towns over which the farm
ers have to haul their produotious to
reach the stations and shipping'points.
This agitation seeks to awake a feeling
of interest in behalf of the support of
the national government by granting
substantial aid to seenes better roads.
No class has a deeper Janterest in this
question than the fawrers. ome ob
ject to the national government taking
hold of such enterpasea as not con
templated in the constitution, but this
argument lo~i $its foaj . owing to the
fact that the gov6rnment' has built
such highways and they are the best
roads in existence to-day.. One of the
principal of these is the great national
road from Washington to St. Louis,
which proved a greater boon and bless
ing to those who lived within its -reach
than any railroad in the nation. Now
the-congress has been most liberal, if
not too extravagant, in granting aid in
land and money to build up those rail
roads that are nothing but private com
panies, and don't enrich the govern
ment from the revenue they receive,
whilst those who travel over the na
tional road have to pay toll every ten

miles. Would it not be consistent in
congress to levy a tax on those suc
cessful railroads in order to create a
general fund to be used in building up
and improving the common roads?
Our present road system is altogether
out of place. All road taxes should be
collected in money and the roads
worked by contract.
The question arises: Where is the
capital to come from to secure such
roads as the farmers have a right to
demand? I would suggest the taxing
of all transportation companies, not
only on their present property, but on
all bonds issued either for actual serv
ice rendered or for fraudulent stock,
commonly called watered stock. Now
there are few who realise the amount
this fraudulent stock represents I
know of one road built in an early day
that cost 025,000 per mile to build. It
can be duplicated to-day for $10,000.
It has been valued for assessment for
taxes as low as $3,000 per mile, includ
ing all its rolling stock, but is repre
sented in the stock market 068,000 per
mile. Then the cities and principal
towns take measures to secure first
class streets by macadamizing or pav
ing with brick or stone, while the
roads leading into them are left to the
care of the farmers, and in wet seasons
are nothing but beds of mrei and crip
ple more horses and damage more ve
hicles than a tax would cover.
I live in a county where there are all
the elements to secure good roads that
a kind providence could bless a people
with; the whole county is underlaid
with limestone and an unlimited sup
ply of first-class gravel, yet till this
winter there has been little effort to
improve the streets, while the roads
are often hub-deep with mud. To re
lieve the idle, unemployed workmen,
they opened a gravel bank and com
menced graveling some of the prin
cipal streets, but as the gravel
was placed on top of two feet
of frost it was not a success at
first, but promises better results in the
future. If the friends of good roads
will only unite and try to secure better
roads it will be an inducement to set
tiers to come into the county, and thus
increase the value of the land in Iowa
as it has done in Ohio. Few can realise
the improvement in the low-lying coun
ties in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, where
they have built first-class roads where
the old mire beds used to exist. The
farmers should unite in securing good
highways.-An Old Granger, in Chi
cago Record.
Treatment for Sore Feet.
This trouble will be a certain result
of permitting a cow to stand in wet
mud or manure, as this inflames the
tender skin between the claws of the
hoofs, where blisters will then appear,
and, breaking by the rubbing, will
form sores. If this is neglected the
hoofs may be wholly destroyed and the
animal permanently injured. The feet
should be well washed with water and
tar or carbolic soap, then dried and
dressed with an ointment made of pure
lard or vaseline, ten parts, and one
part each of turpentine and acetate of
copper, stirred in the lard when it is
melted and until it is cooled, It is
well to.bind the sore feet in bandages
and to keep the animals on a dry floor.
Breedinag for the Dtiry.
There is one important point in
breeding for the dairy which is often
lost sight of even by those who mean
to be good dairymen in every particr
lag. This is having harmony in size
between the sires and the heifers and
cows to which they are bred. A long
train of disorders is directl.y traceable to
the fact that heavy sres mare allowed to
run with the young heifers and small
er cows, and unrestricted service often
alowed. Thi iss a matter which is
often permitted to go by deftaul% aim

Almost Pheoemenal Growth of the Caea

idly growing into one of the most im.
portant industries. In five years the
cheese exports have been raised from
88,500,000 pounds to double that
amount. In butter-making, too, there
has been a proportionately large in
crease. In 1890 the product amounted
to 1,147.000 pounds, and two years later
it had increased to 1,667,000 pounds.
The product both of cheese and butter
sent to Europe has enormously in
creased since 1890. The butter export
was $840,181 in 1890. The next year it
rose to $02,175, and in 1892 it was
$1,066,058.
This industry has a great dairy com
mission that reaches every part of the
dominion. It has its dairy schools and
instructors, supported by the govern
ment. It absolutely prohibits the man
ufacture and sale of oleo, butterine,
filled cheese and adulterated goods in
any form, and instead of hunting up
frauds and prosecuting them the com
mission devotes its energies to assisting
the dairymen and promoting the in
dustry. Canada enjoys the proud dis
tinction of being the only government
in the world that is free from adulter
ated dairy products and that makes no
skimmed cheese-all full cream.
Under these circumstances the in
structions issued by the Ontario col
lege to Canadian dairymen possess
great interest to those Americans who
would improve their own product utth
a view to rivaling the Canadian in the
home and foreign markete. These in
struotibns read as follows:
The maximum of profit can be ob
tained only by the clear-thinking, in
telligent dairyman, who breeds and
feeds to produce the greatest amount
of milk of a good quality at the least
possible cost.
The faithful and constant observance
of the following points will result in a
marked improvement in the condition
of the milk supplied to the cheese fac
tories, an improvement which is much
needed, and the bringing about of
which will enable the cheesemaker to
produce an article much superior to
anything that has been made in the
past, and by so doing we can maintain
our supremacy in the English market.
realize a better price for our goods and
add very materially to the profits of
the dairyman.
Nothing but pure milk from healthy
cows should be sent to the factory. To
secure this cows should have abundance
of wholesome, nutritious food and pure
water, with access to salt at all times
The greatest possible care should be
taken to prevent cows drinking stag
nant water. Mlilk from such cows is
invariably tainted, and no amount of
skill on the part of the cheesemaker
can produce from it a really fine
cheese.
Immediately after the milk is drawn
it should be strained, then aerated by
dipping or pouring, which can be done
very effectively while the milk is yet
in the pails. Be sure that this work is
done in a pure atmosphere, with clean
surroundings, away from the stables or
anything else of an impure nature, for,
unless this be attended to properly,
aeration will be a detriment instead of
a benefit
It is not necessary to cool milk at
night, unless the weather be eftremely
hot, in order to have it in the best con
dition for delivering at the factory in
the morning, providing all pails, mten
sils, strainers, etc., have been thor
oughly washed, then scalded with boil
ing hot water and well aired before
using.
It is just as important that the morn
ing's milk should be well aired before
sending it to the factory. Not only in
the summer should milk be aerated, but
also in the spring and autumn.
The milk stands should be built in
such a way as to exclude the sun and
rain, and yet allow a free circulation of
air around the cans.
The organisms that produce bitter or
tainted milk, or any abnormal change,
are to be found only where there was
filth and carelessness in handling, so
that in all cases when complaint is
made of impure milk the remedy must
be extra cleanliness.-N. Y. World.

WON BY AN OUTSIDER.
We Waited Until the Jack-Pet Maeham.
Was Well Loaded.
The two men were not intoxicated,
though a faint bouquet of cocktail dal1
lied on their breaths.
The man with the heavy red mu-
tache and the lavender tie stood with
his hands deep in his pockets and his
cigar tilted thoughtfully upward, gaz
ing at a slot machine on the cigar case.
His companion was reading the race
card on the other end of the case.
The man with the red mustache push
ed his hand a little deeper into his
pocket. Then he dropped the coin in a
slot at the top of the machine. The
nickel dropped with a tinkling sound
through a series of pegs and in a little
tin compartment at the bottom. At
the bottom of the machine there were
four little traps. Each held five or six
five-cent pieces. The man put another
nickel in the hole. He seemed more
interested now, and watched the coin's
journey with something like anima
tion.
As the coin touched one of the com
partments there was a little click, and
the bottom of the tray dropped, dump
ing a half-dozen nickels into a trough.
The man picked up the money.
"Say, Ed," he said to his com
panion, "come here. Let's beat this
thing."
Ed made an entry in a note-book from
the race-card and walked over to the
machine. The two men patiently drop
ped nickels through the hole in the box
until they ran out. Then each got a
dollar's worth of the barkeeper. The
little trays were getting heavily
loaded, when one of the men put in a
lucky coin and got back a handful of
money.
The machine stood near the street
door, which was open. A group of four
or five men were watching the game.
The two men were doing their best to
fill up the machine, and were succeed
ing reasonably well when a man step
ped'through the door and joined the
group. As to clothes, he was evident
ly the understudy of a man much
larger than himself. His coat was of
the Prince Albert variety, and showed
traces of many meals taken without
the caddish use of a napkin. The sun
and lack of blacking had helped him
out in making tan shoes of what
once were patent-leathers. By this
time one of the trays in the ma
chine was heaped full of shining
nickels and was still receiving sup
plies. The last comer had his hands in
his pockets and seemed to be hunting
desperately for something. Suddenly
he withdrew one hand with something
pinched tightly between a very dirty
finger and a thumb.
Pushing up beside the man with the
red mustache he reached over and
dropped a nickel in the hole of the ma
chine, giving it a little, peculiar twist
as he did so. The coin rattled down
into the fullest tray. There was a rat
tle of coin and a load of nickels dropped
into view. Reaching out two grimy
paws he scooped up the money and
bolted out of the door.
The man with the red mustache gave
a little gasp, swallowed once or twice
and jumped for the door. Half-way up
the alley was a man running very hard
and out behind him floated the tails of
a greasy Prince Albert. coat.-Chicage

SHE GOT HER BRIDAL KISS.
The ILridegroom Did Not Oive It at the
Altar, But Did Ills Duty at the Church
Door.
Many guests at a fashionable church
wedding a few days ago were surprised
when they saw the bridegroom stop
near the door and kiss the bride. It
was so marked a departure from the
old rule of ending the wedding ceremo
ny by a kiss that it caused a great deal
of comment
Very few of those who saw that in
teresting feature of what the bride re
garded as an important part of the cer
emony know how it all came about.
Hundreds of friends had watched the
lovely girl as she moved gracefully
toward the altar. After the ringwhich
told that she was a bride had been
placed on her finger the young bride
looked lovingly toward the bride
groom. One could see she was ready to
receive the bridal kiss.
But the bridegroom had apparently
forgotten that part of the ceremony.
He seemed interested only in getting
out of the church, and abruptly offered
the young woman his arm. With a
little pout of annoyance she placed her
hand on his arm, and they started to
ward the church entrance.
The bride did not intend to leave
that church without having obtained a
bridal kiss, which to her seemed to be
of as much importance in the ceremony
as the words of the minister.
When near the door she whispered
something to the bridegroom which he,
in his efforts to get beyond the gaze of
the throng in the church, failed to un
derstaad.
"'You did not give me my kiss," the
bride repeated in a tone which caused
her words to be heard by some of the
guests near the door.
"I beg your pardon, but I forgot all
about it," whispered the bridegroom,
and right at the door he gave the bride
the kiss she had expected to receive at
the altar.
Then the bride, complete happiness
having been restored by this rounding
out of the marriage ceremony, walked
gracefully out to the carriage and was
driven away with a face wreathed in
smiles.-N. Y. Herald.

stone, Bumbletee, Flagstaf, Defa
Horse canyon and others, concluded his
onslaught with a half-apologetic latgh'
and a good-tempered:
"But, after all, I don't know as it
matters much, Some of those names
will be changed deliberately, as the in
habitants come to -think them ridic
ulous, and most of the rest will be
time-worn into something better after
a century or so."
"Time-worn?' queried an American
listener.
"Yes timeworn. They would be
with us, and" I should suppose they
would be with you," said the amiable
Briton. Then seeing that he was not
fully understood, he added: ."There'sa .
Bloody Gulch, for instance. The ngeq
is harsh and not easily spoken, as well
as hideous in its suggestions. People
will hurry it and clip it and run it to
gether and toss it from mouth to mouth
and it will end by being something
else. If England had had a Bloody
Gulch, named in the time of the invad
ing Danes, do you suppose it would
still be Bloody Gulch to-day? Not at
all! It might be Bluggies or it might
be Blutch. The one thing sure is that
it wouldn't be gulch and it wouldn't be
bloody!
Everybody laughed at a suggestion
which seemed to partake of the nature
of the word-compressing experiments
in "Alice in Wonderland." Neverthe
less, it was founded on solid British
experience.
"English names are as smooth as
pebbles at the bottom of an English
river," said one eminent writer. "They
have been rolled on the tide of speech
till the edges are all worn away."
He cited especially the names of Eng
lish rivers, and called attention to the
large number of them which are of
but one syllable and that syllable fre
quently most expressive, quaint or
melodious, with a charm in the mere
sound. Running over rapidly those of
which he thought at the moment, he
named the Lea, the Tey, the Ouse,
Wear, Cam, Taw, Wye, Teign, Blyth,
Rye, Till, Don, Dart and Dee.
Beside these are the Exe, the Yare
are the Alne-all unfamiliar to Yankee
ears; yet from the little Exe, the En
glish Exeter, Exmouth, Exmoor-the
scene of "Lorna Doone"-together with
its seventeen American namesakes, all
take their names. From the Yare our
Yarmouth is named, and its famous
English original, upon whose sands lay
the fascinating stranded boat inhabited
by Little Em'ly in "David Copper
field."
And how many sturdy descendants
of the pilgrims have ever even hea~rd
the name of the little Plym, at whose
mouth lay the English town the name
of which, like that of stagnant old Bos
ton of the Lincolnshire fens, has risen
to newer and wider honors in the New
England?
Our harsher and longer names may
be 'time-worn to advantage. Indeed,
here and there we can see the process
beginning, oftenest with a name of In
dian origin too cumbrous for our
tongues. Lake \Vinnipiseogee, with
the spelling of which school children
had such difficulty, was once doubtless
pronounced according to that spelling.
Then the sound changed, while the
written syllables remained; and now
we see it oftenest written as it is
spoken-Winnepesaukee.
There is amply room in our geog
raphy for simplifying and abbreviating,
though it is also true that some of the
longest names are easily spoken and
are pleasant to the ear, but these have
no rough edges to wear off and we may
hope that the "tide of speech" will
carry them down unspoiled through
the centuries
Let us keep the Monongahela, the
Susquehanna and the Juniata in their
full pride; and surely not even the
flashing Dart nor the lapsing Dee have
sung themselves into a language as
sweetly as the Sawanee river. -Youth's

SASHES AND BELTS.
They Are Necessities to the Fashionable
Summer Wardrobe.
The sash, that prettiest and most
youthful of ornaments, is returning
with the spring. It is an almost indis
pensable accessory of a summer dress.
The flimsy, fluffy fabrics which we can
not make to fit tight, and would not if
we could, can only be prettily subdued
into something like conformity to the
figure by confining with belt or sash.
Last year the wide belt, which almost
resembled a peasant waist, served to
hold in check the unruly folds of sum
mer gowns. This season the wide befit
has been cut in two, and the sections
are set one above the other and two or
three inches apart, the rosettes being
placed on nearly opposite sides.
Sometimes these two sections are
very narrow, becoming mere velvet
bands of half an inch in width.
At present the big, soft bow of surah
or India silk is preferred for allsuch
garments. But before very long we
may expect to see the large moire
bows, which have recently disputed the
rights of any place in life with the
chins of the elite, removed to the waist
where they belong.
It will be entirely in keeping wlth
the erase for moire and the combias
tion of black and white to see white
dresses this summer with black noire
aashes.-Chicago News.
