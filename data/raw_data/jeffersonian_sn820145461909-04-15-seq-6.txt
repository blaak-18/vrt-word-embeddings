REV. C. A. NORTON’S CHARGES.
Ellaville, Ga., April 1, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: My attention having
been called to a card appearing in the
“Jeffersonian,” March 25, written by
Mr. T. J. Pilcher, of Schley county,
and your reply to same, has been
noted, and with due consideration;
and your personal reply, agreeing to
allow me space in your paper to reply
to same, which I appreciate.
In the first place, I wish to say that
I did not use the language as quoted
in Mr. Pilcher’s letter.
First. I stated to Mr. Pilcher that
there was an estate, principally in
money, left by a Mr. Allison, the
amount of which was $90,000, and
that $15,000 of the $90,000 was left
by Mr. Allison and his widow, a Mrs.
Starks, for educational purposes;
namely, to educate the poor children
of Green county; and that the re
maining $75,000 was to go to the
heirs of Mrs. Starks, who was the
first wife of Mr. A. J. Roberts, and
at her death it went to her heirs.
Second: I said that Mr. McDaniel,
later Governor of Georgia, was the
executor of the above estate, or
money, which was left by Mr. Alli
son and his widow, a Mrs. Starks.
Third: I said, moreover, that Mr.
A. J. Roberts did turn over to you, as
his attorney, a copy of the paper, or
papers, or deed, representing this
money or estate, to settle with Mr.
McDaniel, the executor, and that some
months after you had received the
above papers from Mr. Roberts you
reported back to him, saying, “Jack,
I am very sorry, but I have lost those
papers,” referring, of course, to the
paper or papers, or deed, that Mr.
Roberts had placed into your hands
as his legal representative.
Fourth: Furthermore, I said that
the heirs had never received or had
gotten any part of that estate; and
that the last account of the estate it
was in the hands of Mr. McDaniel, as
executor, and yourself, as the legal
representative of the heirs.
The above is, in substance, what I
said to Mr. Pilcher, and he was left
to draw his own conclusions, which
was very easy for him to do.
In your reply to Mr. Pilcher’s letter
you state, in no uncertain terms, that
“never have I lost papers that caused
the loss of any estate.” I did not
claim, nor did I say, that you had
lost any papers, but did say that you,
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, so reported to
Mr. A. J. Roberts, that you had lost
the papers turned over to you by him
(Roberts) which had been delivered
to you, representing the above men
tioned estate.
In proof of the above claim, I will
give you my author, and one that
you will not deny nor can you im
peach.
My author is a friend of yours, and
one of your warmest supporters.
Certificate.
“This is to certify, that I, Andrew
J. Roberts, did, on or about the year
of our Lord 1869 or 1870, deliver
to the Hon. Thos. E. Watson papers,
or copy of deed, representing the Alli
son estate, which estate went to a
Mrs. Starks, said estate representing
some S9O/000, $15,000 were to go
to the education of the poor children
of Green county.
“.Some months after the said Hon.
Thos. E. Watson reported to me that
he had lost the copy of said deed.
“(Signed) A. J. Roberts.”
“Norwood, Ga., 1909.”
The above is, in substance, what I
have said, and still claim, and proof
of my claim.
Now, Mr. Watson, you said that
you had never lost any papers causing
the loss of any estate. But Mr.
Roberts certifies that you so stated to
him relative to the papers that were
in your possession representing the
above estate.
No one has charged that you lost
them, but here is proof that you said
that you lost them.
Will you tell what became of them
(the papers) ?
Surely, surely, one of your mental
powers can recall a matter like the
one in question.
Os course, you can reply by saying
“that I know nothing of the matter
in question,” as you have done, or
else you can reply by saying that you
do not recall or remember anything
of the matter in question. But what
will vou say in the face of the above
proof?
We will most certainly thank, and
appreciate the fact, if Mr. McDaniel
will explain to the heirs as to what
disposition was made of the Allison
estate, as none of the heirs ever got
or received any part of it.
Thanking you for-the space in your
paper for the above,
I am, very respectfully,
C. A. Norton.
P. S. —Please give space to this in
your next issue, and oblige,
C. A. N.

editorials.)

STRONG WORDS CONDEMNING
THE GEORGIA SANATORIUM.
Webster, Fla.
Hon. T. E. Watson,
Dear Sir and Friend: I have just
read the statement of Mr. R. E. Dun
nington in last week’s Jeffersonian
and as I have read all you have print
ed concerning this institution, I wish
to extend you my heartfelt thanks
for the interest y< u have taken in
this matter.
I was an inmate of the Georgia
Sanatorium for four months and I
can certify to the truth of every
thing Mr. Dunnington says concern
ing the “Grub” and “Physical treat
ment.” I never knew any one to
get much medical treatment there.
Now, I was on Ward 7 and Ira
Hemphill and Gordon McDade were
my “Chokers.” I was making an
unusual lot of noise one night and
Gordon McDade and another, but not
Hemphill, came into my room and
while the other one held a lamp, Gor
don McDade pounced upon me and
choked me until I thought I would
die, and then asked me if I would
hush, and I could not speak for want
of breath, so he kicked my head
against the brick wall and choked me
again, and when he let go. the second
time I gasped and managed to say,
“Yes, sir,” and they went out and
left me.
1 have seen Gordon McDade sling
a patient full length of the floor three
times just because he did not have
sense enough to push a scrub broom
or mop. I saw one attendant throw
a one-legged man named Daughtry,
down on the floor and choke him and
beat his head on the floor just be
cause the patient went on another
ward next to ours.
I could tell you a lot of things like
these, but 1 don’t wish to take too
much of your time. I hope this thing
will be investigated as I would like
to be a witness before a committee
or a jury to tell on oath what I saw
and felt while there.
While T was there a committee
from the Legislature came down and
the “Chokers” had everything pre
pared and all the bad patients out on
the yard where they were out of the
way, and, of course, that “Spree”
committee just passed through and
that was enough. I don’t think they
saw very much.
Mr. Dunnington gave you a very
sad verbal picture of the sanatorium,
but I am willing to swear the picture
is “true to life.” Sad, but alas, too
true.
To give you my opinion of the S.
L. A. in a nutshell, were I his Satanic
Majesty and had all my way, I would
sell Hell to the biffbest bidder for
cash and buy the Georgia Sanatorium,
as it is more hellish than Hell itself.
Os course this is my private opinion.
With love and best wishes for your
welfare, I am as ever
Your friend,
F. Todd...
MUST BE BEST IN THE
COUNTRY.
Strip, Texas.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Thomson,
Ga.,
Dear Sir: You can consider me a
life-time subscriber to your two publi
cations. They must be the best in the
country. If the majority of the peo
ple had been reading your two publi
cations, Mr. Bryan would never have
been nominated in 1908, and I don’t
very much think that Mr. Taft would
be in the President’s chair today. We
have a world of reformers in Texas,
but they are all asleep. If they had
had a thunder-bolt over here in Texas
like Georgia had in the 1908 campaign
I think some of them would have
woke up. We need something like
Georgia has to wake up our Texas re
formers.
Let us have a conference and re
organize under the name of “Reform
Democrats.” It’s all in the name
with the most of people anyway. I
think we can unite under that name.
Let us drop the name of “Populist.”
It’s like the Democratic Party, it’s
had too much Bryanism. I will pay
one dime a month until the 1912 elec
tion, and 'will commence now. How
many old guards will do this much? I
mean what I say.
Yours for reform,
W. A. Sterrett.
WILL GO TO CAMPAIGN FUND.
Canton, Ga.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
Dear Sir: I herewith enclose you
a two dollar money order. Send me
your Jeffersonian Magazine one year
for one dollar and the other one you
can keep and apply in any way you
see fit for the good of the cause of
reform. If you wish you can use it to
fight the missionaries with. I am a
Baptist, and I think that you are
right on this subject. I am a charter
member of the People’s Party. I
commenced with it and I am going to
end with it. I never have voted in
but two Democratic primaries since
I was born into the People’s Party.
Your friend for the good of the
cause, R. B. Clark.
’‘ALMOST PERSUADAD.”
Keatchie, La.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
My dear Mr. Watson: I wish to
thank you for sending me the April
number of your magazine. Your
article on foreign missions is, alone,
worth the price of a year’s subscrip
tion. In taking up this subject, you
are doing a great favor to the church,
the missionaries and the people. It
is such fearlessness as this, that en
dears you to all true lovers of liberty.
There are thousands like myself, who,
though not entirely agreeing with you
on all subjects, yet our souls are
thrilled with admiration tor the
