HOW ACT DEMONETIZING SIL
VER WAS PASSED.
It Was Rushed Thregh Corurses With

Oh by the Previous Questlon-People
Never Reard of It.
Arkansas Gazette: It has been often
rehearsed, so often indeed that one
would think every citizen of the roun
try was familiar with the facts, but
they are not, or if they read about it
they have forgotten the facts.
The act demonetizing silver was
smuggled through congress. Less than
a half dozen members knew of it.
President Grant, who signed the bill,
was utterly ignorant of it. Judge
Kelly, of Pennsylvania, the chairman
of the committee on coinage, weights
and measures at the time, when
charged with having advocated the de
monetization of silver, said in a speech
in the house: "In connection with the
charge that I advocated the bill which
demonetised the standard silver dol
lar, I say that, though chairman of the
*nmmittee on coinage, I was as ignor
ant of the fact that it would demone
tize the silver dollar, or of its drop
ping the silver dollar from our system
of coins, as were those distinguished
senators, Messrs. Blaine and Voorhaes,
who were then members of the house,
and each of whom, a few days since,
interrogated the other: 'Did yeo know
it was dropped when the bill passed?'
'No,' said Mr. Blaine, 'did you?' 'No,'
said Mr. Voorhees. 'I do not think
there were three members in the house
that knew it. I doubt whether Mr.
Hooper, who, in my absence from the
committee on coinage and attendance
on the. committee on ways and means,
managed the bill, knew It. I say this
in Justice to him." This statement was
made in the Forty-fith oareess.
In the Forty-sixth congress the mat
ter was again brought to the attention
of the house by Judge Kelly, who aid:
"All that I can r4y is that the commit
tee on coinage, weights and measures,
who reported the original bill, were
faithful and able, and scsaned Ms pro

Exahange, but a resident of Denver for
several years. The present editor of
"The Gazette" met Mr. Luckenbazh
ofte in Denver and heard him re
hearse the matter, substantially as
given in this statement:
"In 1865 I visited London, England,
for the purpose of pleaing there Penn
sylvania oil properties in which I was
interested. I took with me letters of
introduction to many gentlemen in
London, among them one Mr. Ernest
Seyd, from Robert M. Faust, ex-treas

acquainted with Mr. Seyd and with his
brother, Richard Seyd, who, I under
stand, is yet living. I visited London
thereafter every year, and with each
visit renewed my acquaintance with
Mr. Seyd. In February, 1874, while on
one of these visit, sad while his guest

HUNTINGTON'S SCHEME.
Wants the Governmuent to Watt 100
Years Losger.
The case of the Central Pacific rail
road is one that justifies the govern
ment control of railroads. The rela
tion of the Central Pacific and the
government is thus stated by the
Twentieth Century:
"The Central Pacific railroad com
pany is bankrupt. Its immense in
debtedness includes a round $80,000,
000 to the ,United States government.
This sum represents principal and in
terest of 6 per cent bonds, payable in
thirty years from date, issued by the
government to the builders of the Cen
tral Pacific road at different times be
tween 1865 and 1872. The original
sum total of them all aggregated about
$28,000.000. The first of these bonds
became payable In January, 1895, and
the interest during all those yeans, not
compounded, came to 180 per cent of
the face value of the bonds. The re
maining bonds fall due at intervals an
til 1902. Now, the sole survivor of the
four men who built the road is C. P.
Huntington, and he is responsible for
the bills that turn up so persistently
in congress.
Mr. Huntington wishes congress to
decree that the railroad be granted
100 years longer in whleh to pay this
debt. Interest he says should be 2 per
oent, and the United States govern
ment should become responsible for
both principal and interest of these
new 100 year bonds. The bonds now
existing are to be cancelled when the
new bonds make their appearance, and
the railroad itself shall be freed from
its present indebtedness atogther.
Tbhe railroad proposes to pay principal
and interest of the new bonds in in
stallmenta, the last one falling due in
1M7.
That is a very interesting scheme.
If It smceeds Mr. HuBtington will be
the most famous money maker that
ever lived. For these reasons:
The Central Pacific railroad exists
under California laws. It is art Ia
oarperlted under the national govern
eat. Its charter expires ia 2111.
Its abilre must be wound sa then.
Should it pay its debts it may rein
cerpaste. If not, it gses late a e

WHAT IS MONEY?'
THE POWER TO CREATE VESTED
IN CONGRESS ALONE.
The Value of Money I. Legal and Not
Material-Iron and Steel lntriasotcaly
Worth More Than Silver or Gold
Some Sound Reaeoatng.
While everybody-and most par
ticularly those who have the least of
it-are talking about money and dis
cussing the money question, especially
gold and silver money, it might be
well for them. in order to better in
form themselves, to stop and ask
themselves the sober question in the
above caption--"What Is Money?"
The child will tell you that it is what
you buy candy with. Some men,
who pass for great statesmen, will tell
you that it is gold and silver and
bank paper based on gold and silver,
with nickel and copper for currency.
This is true. But these metals have
not always been money, neither are
they necessarily the only substance
out of which money may be made.
Money is a creation of law. The
constitution of the United States says
that "Congress shall have power to
coin money and regulate the value
thereof"; and it does not specify any
particular substance out of which
such money shall be coined. At dif
ferent periods in the world's history
nearly everything has been used as
money. Probably the earliest money
in general use to any great extent
were sheep and cattle. In ancient
Britain slaves were used as money
and were called "living money." In
Sparta, during the reign of Lycur
gus, iron was the medium of ex
change. Rome first used gold for i
money about two centuries before the
Christian era. Carthage used leather
bearing the stamp of government.
Cathay used as meoney the inner bark
of a certain tree, cut Into circle and
bearing the imprint of the king. It
was a full legal tender, and to coun
terfeit it or depreciate it or attempt
to depreciate it by refusing to accept
it in payment for debts was death.
Glans coin was at one time the cur
rency of Arabia, and codfish was
used as money in Newfoundland. At
one time in Massachusetts musket
balls were used as money. In 1732
tobacco was legal tender in Mary
land, and nails were used for small
change in Scotland as late as 1776.
George W. Childs stated in his paper,
the Ledger, that turnips circulated in
Philadelphia in the place of copper
cents as late as 1865. A hundred
other instances could be mentioned.
Money is a representative of" value;
simply a medium of exchange, and a
creature of law. We will quote a little
from high authority:
"Money is a value created by law.
Its value is legal and not material. It
is perhaps not easy to convince one
that the value of metallic money is
created by law. It is, however, a
fact."-Heari Cernunchi.
"To coin money and regulate its
value as an act of sovereignty in
volves the right to determine what
shall be taken and received as money;
at what measure or price it shall be
taken; and what shall be its effect
when passed or tendered in payment
or satistaction of legal obligations.
Government can give to its stamp
upon leather the same money value
as if put upon gold or silver, or any
other material."-Judge Tiffany, In
"Omstitution Law," page E2.
"Metallic money, while acting as
coin, is identical with paper money In
respect to its being destitute of in
trinsic value."-North British Re
view.
"Money is a medium of exchange.
Wbatever performs this function,
does the work, is money, no matter
what It is made oL"-Walker's Po
Ittll Mooomy.
"Gold and silver ae not intrinsically
of the equal value et frn. No meth
ods have been hitherto formed to e
tablish a medium of trade equal La all
advantages to its bills of credit made
legal tende."-Be-mlami Panklin.

It would not have been hoarded if it

question.
Cleveland and Carlisle.
The telegram of Mr. Cleveland to the
bondocrats of Louisville on the oc
casion of the notification of the bolters
that they had been nominated, was
most natural. Mr. Cleveland during
his last administration has Deen so
busy in bond deals that it is natural
he should mistake bondocrats for dem
ocrats. But it is a little odd that Mr.
Carlisle in his communication should
call the goldbug bondocrats "the old
fashioned democrats," when he de
clared in 1878 that this bondocratic
"conspiracy which seems to have been
formed here and in Europe to destroy
by legislation and otherwise from
three-sevenths to one-half of the met
allic money of the world is the most
gigantic crime of this or any other
age." Will Carlisle have the same
faith in Cleveland after the 4th of
March as he now has if he does not
get a fat place in New York for his
services as secretary? It is to be
hoped that the Morgans and the Bel
monts will retain both Cleveland and
Carlisle as long as they live for their
faithful service to them.
Why Mamufaetarers Ittimidat.
The editor of this paper has been
canvassing in Maryland, New York,
and New England for the past two
weeks, sad asserts without fear of con
tradiction that if the people could
cast their ballots without fraud and
corruption on the part of the gold
bugs and without intimidation on the
part of employers of labor, Bryan
wodid carry every section which the
editor visited by a majority of more
than two to one. The people appear to
be all one way, the banks and the
employers of labor all the other way.
It seum that the London banks di
rect the policy of the New York Lanks,
the New York banks control the coun
try banks, and the country banks have
got manufacturers and all other busi
ness men by the throat, and they dare
not either think or act for themselves.
And that explains why the &mployers
of labor are issuing circulars and mak
ing threats against their employee if
they do not vote for the perpetuation
of the gold standard.
Porrtr Dias Mm Meste.
Much has been said about the dis
astrous effects of the free coinage in
Mexico. Porfrlro Dias, the president
of Mexico, tells us just what the effect
of the use of silver is in his country,
and how the difference of exchange
benefits Mexico. His statement is
published elsewhere in this issue.
Notwithstanding the undisputed evi
dence that the silver standard coun
tries have a tariff against the United
States in the difference of exchange
which is a bounty on exports and a
tax on imports, the republican party,
claiming to be the party of protection
for the United States, Insists that
(hina and Japan shall be first pro
tected. That protection agalnst the
United States is just as much a car
dinal doctrine of the republean party
in this campaign as protection for the
United States has ever been, is now
well established.
The people of the United 8tates,
happy in the enjoyment of the bless

NOT AN EXPERIMENT.
Free Silver Colnage Would Be O~a a
Return to First Prlnolploee.
(From Denver Times, Silver Republa
can.)
One of the argumentat advanced by
the gold standard advocates is that any
change in our monetary system would
create, in our own country, a danger
ous disturbance of values and would
completely upset our business relations'
with all foreign countries.
It might be supposed from their atti
tude on this question that we are en
joying a high degree of prosperity, and
that this desirable state of existence
might be endangered by the proposed
change in the monetary system. In
view of the bankruptcy, poverty, and
distress of the people of the United
States to-day, are we not called upon
to try something, although the rem
edy we try may not be perfect? We
have tried the single gold standard for
over twenty years, and after so long
a trial we have reached business par
alysis, labor is unemployed and poverty
and want is upon every side, and we
have yet to hear of a prospect of im
provement under a continuation of the
gold standard.
Bimetallism, however, is no expert
ment. History tells us that under this
system alone the world has been pros
perous. To return to the bimetallic
standard is no new order of things, and
to wait for an international agreement
is to never return to bimetallism. It
is probable that an International agree
ment for the establishment of a ratio
between gold and silver will never be
made, even though all nations should
suddenly become bimetallistr. The rea
son for this is that each nation makes
its own laws concerning legal tender
money and banking.
An international agreement would be
a treaty between nations, and treaties
are of no other binding effect than the
willingness of the parties to them to
maintain them. It is the law of na
tions that any nation may withdraw
from any treaty to which it is a party,
whenever that treaty operates pernl
ciously upon its Interests.
A change in our financial system'
however radical it might be, would nt
prevent other countries from tradig
with us. The United States could not
build a wall high enough to prevent
John Bull from climbing over it to sell
us his goods, under whatever Snmelal.
system we choose to adopt. If may for
eign nation felt disposed to stop trad
ing with us because her people disliked
our financial system, we would try sad
get along without buying from them.
Commerce and trade do not depend
upon the uniformity of money in the
different countries. Gold Itself is not
international money. A little experl
menting by the United States would
not be out of place at the present tlm.
Under the gold standard we have been
steadily going from bad to worse, and
yet from year to .year the gold mono
metallists have insisted that trede
would soon be better and times would
mgprove-Just hold on a little longer
and all would be well.
The American people have had
enough of the "prosperity" of the gold
standard system) and propose to re
Sturn to the financial system of pros
perous times, and in doing so the coun
try will be able to withstand the shook
of the alleged experiment.
P. 8.-The single gold standard is an
experiment and the empty pocketbooks
of the people toll how costly it hae
proved.
