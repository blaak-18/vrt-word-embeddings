"A Far'lal Knding"-"A White
waush."
Prom the tenor of the Times' editorial
heade1 "A Farotal E.dlng," and the
plaint of the Journsl-"A Whitewashb," it
is olear that the fiding or verdict of :ae
committee is not to their liking.
It would seem muoh eusl r to criticise
and allege, than to submit the proofs
which are essential to conviction.
Why not be fair to the committee, at
least, if sot to the polle? r
In the alleged "poker game" or robbery
at the Union depot the polhoe committee
state:
" We, the adenlgned polloe committee,
cried together tor the purpose of loves
~tgating the charges m ,eO by the prese
agamnst a member of ie pollie force in
the (Guio bneo ease at the olin depot
some time ago, did set have any evidence
to ceavlot the oloer. . o wilines appear
ed who Aave say testimony ledlestiag that
a poloeman was Inolved. Use witnes
iM testify that the unfortunate man was
steered over to the Uleon depot hotel by
one Smiley and awa) Irom there by a
crippled man, name unknown."

It is a tasteless mineral water, soft and
delightful to the taste. As a table water it

Now that the people of Shreveport have a
