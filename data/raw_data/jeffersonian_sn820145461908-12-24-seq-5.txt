quiry, “Will doesn’t know. I made
the doctor tell me the truth —and
Will could not bear to question him.
I’m very hopeful, myself, and you
mftst not worry a mite only—we will
try to help and comfort each other
now— ’ ’
We were shaken with weeping.
Sister May! A surgeon’s knife —or
to die! We had never contemplated
such horrors. She had been an in
valid, true, since that terrible rail
road wreck, but so sunny, so dainty
in her negligee frocks, her mind so
bright and sparkling. She had just
that charm and fragility which made
men her worshippers and even arous
ed an actual chivalry toward her in
women.
I think we were going distracted,
quite, in the gush of feeling which
had swept over us like a torrent,
when my tear-dimmed eyes fell upon
a motto which I had thoughtlessly
tacked on the wall, never heeding its
meaning particularly.
“If it were not for regret for the
past, and fear for the future, the
present ills would be easy enough to
bear.” Finding a very choked voice,
I tremulously read it aloud. We
grasped it as the proverbial drowning
man a straw. Belle spoke first:
“I’m ashamed of my puny trou
ble, in the. face of these real sorrows.
But we are all on the knees of the
gods. If you won’t think me heart
less, I would propose that we dry
our tears, call in the men and the
children, forget that there was a yes
terday or will be a tomorrow and
just have one tonight—and let it be
a Christmas such as it was before
we grew up.”
“Bravo for Belle,” chimed Sister
May, gaily. “If God wills that it is
to be our last Christmas together,
we will make it the sweetest one we
ever had.”
Jim’s wife had lapsed into her
usual timidity, but I went to her and
we kissed —as sisters—for the first
time. How shamed I was that I had
misjudged her —that her little gram
matical slips had exasperated me,
her soft voice an annoyance, her very
sweetness been wasted on my prim
displeasure!
And we did have a wonderful even
ing. The tears would come to the
surface every little while, but the
spirit of infinite good will radiated
in a tenderness which filled our
hearts to the brim.

That was last year. Another Christ
mas eve has stolen upon me, moon
clear and white, as I finish my last
preparations for the morrow. For
I’m to be hostess again, and, God
be thanked, to the same little band —
and two others!
For Cousin Belle is bringing the
finest husband!
She has confided to me that
Harry’s death left her more lonely
than despairing, that they had often
quarreled, and that she herself had
doubted happiness with him. So
there had been contrition as well as
grief, to make the blow the harder.
“I shall never cease to be sorry that
Harry is dead. But, dear, I am so
glad I am Allan’s wife!”
And Jim’s wife has the sweetest
little blue-eyed daughter! She does
naot “take the place” of baby Louise,
No living child supplants the dead.
Yet she has brought a consolation all
her own to Alice, who has grown
really beautiful. I am very fond of
brother Jim, but I must own I am
glad this baby does not resemble him
or the boys.
And Sister May, the rascal! After
an age-long siege in the hospital, she
pulled through. She is the same
sunny-tempered darling she always
was, but actually growing stout and
aggressive. Yes, I am afraid she is
what they cal! a Suffragette. Will
does not reprove her as he should,
and I fear for the family traditions
—I positively do.
And I’m very much afraid the men
won’t be the only reminiscent ones
tomorrow, either. We will have no
pipes, not even May would dare so
much as a cigarette, for all her ap
palling notions, but something tells
me that, when dinner is over and the
dishes cleared away, the men off to
themselves and we women alone,
someone will be sure to say: “Do
you remember?”
****** «
Somehow I hope that all the grown
ups may have one beautiful day out
of the 365, unmarred by anxiety, un
touched by regret or fear. After
childhood, of course, we can’t “make
believe in iSanta Claus.” But we
can “make believe” that it’s a dear,
sweet old world that begins Christ
mas morning and will end happily
Christmas night.
Leave behind the pitiful mourning
for the past. There have been be
reavements which desolated; there
have been estrangements and separa
tions as hard, or harder, to bear.
Each has gone through his Gethse
mane and come out with the blood
drops on his brow. But —forget!
He or she is not here to share our
day, but would they wish us to wear
our hearts out with useless grief?
Perhaps they know a fairer Yule-tide
then we have ever dreamed. One day
we will have our own again.
And the future? Why dread it?
We will meet its conflicts as we have
met those in the past. But today
speaks “Peace!” Bear only the
present ills. God pity those whose
present ills are so bitter that life lies
grey and hopeless. To them His com
fort. But to most of us the Christ
mas day could be a day of happiness
if we would will it so.

THE OLD SOUTH.
At a Teachers’ Institute one day,
not long since, the subject up for dis
cussion was United States Elistory.
“How do you teach the Civil War?”
asked someone.
Then a man who had long been a
prominent and successful teacher,
who was then a county school eom
missoner, and who was a native Geor
gian, got up and said: “I do not
teach it. I think that period of our
history would be best forgotten. Nev
er, since when a fifteen-year-old boy,
I went with my father to our nearest
town one day not long after the war
and saw the Stars and Stripes flung
to the breeze from the top of a cir
cus tent pole, have I felt like teach
ing the history of the Civil War to
Ukffersoniart
Southern boys and girls. We just
skip that part of the book. I
don’t want to remember that my
father ever raised his sword against
the United States flag.”
■Such a speech as that, coming
from such a source, shocked me. I
was surprised and I was indignant.
So I stood up and said that the South
was fighting for a principle, that their
country was invaded, their homes
threatened, their honor at stake;
that the lives of Lee and Jackson
and 'Stephens and Davis and every
other hero who offered his life for his
country and for the right as he un
derstood it, ought to be an inspira
tion to us, and that I expected to so
teach it as long as I taught anything.
And then somebody said that that
was not a question for discussion be
fore the Institute, and I had to sit
down and keep mum —with so much
on my mind that I wanted to say.
Last Memorial Day I was in At
lanta, and as the great Memorial
Day parade passed along the streets
of that city a gentleman, a Southern
er and a well-educated, cultured man,
said to me, “This is all foolish
ness. The sooner the South forgets
all about it the better.”
One day I asked a lovable, intelli
gent literary woman, one who has an
editorial position on a prominent
Georgia paper, whether she had read
“Bethany.” She replied, “No, Life*
is too short for me to take time to
read such books as ‘Bethany’ and
the ‘Clansman.’ There is no use in
trying to keep up the old fuss. Let
us forgive and forget ” I then put
myself in the give-you-a-little-infor
mation line and told her that she
bad received a wrong impression as
to the purpose of those books —that
they were not written to open old
wounds, not in any spirit of unfriend
liness toward the North, but that
justice might be done to the South
that the present and coming genera
tions might know more of the truth
as to the South’s position in those
crucial days.

deplore the all-too-prevalent senti
ment that prompted them. The idea
that any Southerner could be
ashamed of, could wish forgotten,
that inspiring story of sublime cour
age, manly independence, genuine pa
triotism, unfaltering devotion to du
ty. What true man or woman of
the South, or any other section, does
not gladly honor these men of the 60’s
who fought with an unconquerable
spirit and a courage that won them
the admiration of the world, for
home, for country, for a right guar
anteed to them as they understand it,
in the Constitution of the Un
ited States? I am proud to call
them my ancestors. I should de
spise them if they had done less.
I love every part of our country—
every foot of it, from the Great
Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, from
the Atlantic to the Pacific, and I
never catch a glimpse of the 'Stars
and Stripes but that I feel a thrill of
patriotic pride. But can not the
South—our own sunny land —be very,
very dear to us without disparage
ment to other sections? We don’t
have to love the North any less be
cause we love the South so much.
To me the story of the 'South up
to and during the war between the
states is as glorious a heritage of
honor, of real manhood and woman
hood, of courage and loyalty and he
roic sacrifice as any people ever be
queathed to those who came after
them. *
auoii no t lovingly and rever
ently teach this story to the boys and
girls, to the men and women of our
land—this story of a glorious past?
“A past which held all that was best
and noblest of the South, an age and
condition which never had its like
on earth before, and which can never
be repeated”—a past that ought to
be sacred to the heart of every South
ern man and woman.
Is it not a noble work to do—
to perpetuate the memory and spirit
and traditions of the Old iSouth?
Let us forgive—we have forgiv
en —but let us never forget!
