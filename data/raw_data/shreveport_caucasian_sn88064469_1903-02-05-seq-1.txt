I THE DAVIS MONUMENT
CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE
REQUESTS ORDERS.
Sets of Plates Typifying the Three
Branches of Military Service-The
Cavalryman, the Infantryman

Mrs. N. V. Randolph, chairman of
the central committee of the Jefferson
Davis Monument Association, Rich
mond, Va., has sent the circular which
follows to the Confederate workers of
New Orleans. whom she hopes to inter
est in its announcement. The circular
says:
"The central committee of the Jeffer- c
son Davis Monument Association has in
press a set of three plates,, representing r
the three branches of the Confederate s
army. These plates are executed in the
best style of colored work, from de- I
signs in water color, by William L. t
Sheppard. Mr. Sheppard's service in the t
Confederate army afforded him advant
ages in the study of types, places and I
color in the life of the Confederate sol- i
dier which were possessed- by only a few a
artists.
"The figures are treated with almost c
no background, and only a few acces
sories appropriate to the branch of the a
service represented.
"The cavalryman is about to saddle
his horse; has the bridle- in his hand, 4
while the saddle is on a limb near by, I
and near it lie his " rolled blanket and
saber. I
"The infantryman is equipped with 1
rolled blanket over his shoulder, "belt, t
bayonet, canteen, etc. He has stopped r
for .a moment at the camp fire to light
his pipe, and supports his rifle in the"
Hililow. of his elbow, in order to have
both hands free,

DEATH OF S. B. PUGH.
The death of Mr. Stephen B. Pugh,
which occurred at his residence near
Dona postoffice in the third ward, last
Saturday, was a calamity to his immedi
ate neighbors and is deeply regretted by
all who knew the deceased gentleman.
Mr. Pugh was an old citizen of our par
ish, and a good one in every sense of the
word. He was a farmer and, since com
ing to the parish, has lived continuously
near where he died. He' was a consistent
member of the Baptist church' and was
governed by. the principle of letting his
acts speak for his religion. He was the
friend of the rich and the poor, t1-e
white and the black, the old and the'
young. His illness was of long dura
tion, bitt he awaited the dread summons
with patience, fortitude and Christian
resignation. The good deeds done by
him will live long in the memory of the
recipients.-Mansfield Journal.
The deceased was < esteemed sub
scriber and a friend of the Caucasian.
ROADWAY IMPROVEMENT.
The improvement and betterment of
public roads can not be lasting unless
there be drainage. This remark was
uttered by a friend and subscriber of the
Caucasian who resides beyond the city
limits and is interested in good roads.
"All I ask of you," he said in his talk,
is. to insist on drainage." This plea is
most forceful whep applied to roads
hici cross- or at the crossings of roads.

The wedding iras bi '
bride and. the popuauri~ o
At 6 o'cloek the first strains of aoen
grin's wedding march gladdened the in
vited guests and announced the coming
of the bridal party. A full vested choir,
each member bearing a lily in hand, ren
dered in beautiful tones "Faithful and
True." The bridal party were pre ded
by the ushers, Messrs. A. D. Re-dall,
J. A. Thigpen, A. J. Ingersoll, S. X,
Hicks, Dr. T. E. Schumpert and J. H,
Newcomb. Two little- maids, KOethaen

neices of the bride, lw r
ton McM xin, wife *1 I*e.i $ epp -
Millia, esgovernor ; `.inkae -
Mrs. Foster-Come s, sisters of the
bride, were the ladies in waiting. Then
came the little ring-bearer. Miss Clai
borne Foster-Comegys, and the bride
entered leaning on the arm of her elder
brother, Hon. W. L Foster, rsiilroad
commissioner. At the altar the groom
was waiting with 'his best man,. Hon.
J. M. Foster, brother of the bride. The
words spoken by Rev. Edward Mack
were eloquently impressive. The bride
robed in white ivofy satin trimmed with
chiffon and point lace was` a vision of
loveliness. As is generally known, the
bride is a daughter of the late J. M.
Foster, for years president of the police
jury of Caddo parish and a leader in
politics in this State.
The groom, Mr. Felix McWillie Wil
liams, is the commercial agent of the
Texas and Pacific in Shreveport, a
brother-in-law of Mr. C_ G. Rives,
comptroller of the city of Shreveport,
and a brother of Mr. G. G. Williams of
the G.,G. Williams Printing Company.
It may be said in this connection that
Mr. Williams is also a descendant of
Governor McWillie of Mississippi.
At thefend of. the function at the
church the bridal party were driven to
Curraghmuir, the beautiful home of the
bride's mother, beyond Fairfield, where
a reception was held and where Mr. and
Mrs. Williams received. the hearty con
gratulations of their friends. It may be
of interest, to say that Mr. and Mrs.
Williams left on the xo :o p.m. train
for New York, from which, they will
take a trip to Europe. We wish them a
pleasant journey and a safe return.
MARRIAGE OF FIRST COUSINS.

Legislature prohibiting marriages of
first cousins, parties thus related have
gone into an adjoining State to have

HE LOST HIS GOLD
a-.
HAD THIRTY-FIVE HUNDRED
DOLLARS IN HIS BAG.
He Played With Sharks and Has bue
Experience.-Adams Will Know
Better the Next Time.
On Mond :v afternoon a so-called
farmer named C. B. Adamas was te
lieved of his hand traveling satchel or
bag in which there was over S3ooo i0
gold twenty-dollar gold pieces. The
story could be lengthened into columns
but the facts abi reviate i are:
Adams is from Center, Tex. He has
been in Shreveport -cveral days. He is
not of the unsophisticated kind. He is
not what could be styled a festive coun
try jay. At any rate, he negotiated on
Monday morning at the Commercial
National Bank certificates payable at
Center. Tex.. aggregating $3500. He
demanded gold and gold was paid over
to him, excepting a few dollars in cur
rency which he placed in his bag. He
was advised to leave the money on de
posit or to have it expressed to Center,
Tex., but he wanted no safeguards; he
could take care of his money; no one
could rob him or take it away from him.
He left the bank with his gold, going,
he said, to catch the train at the Hous
ton and Shreveport depot. It was about
so a.m. and the passenger train was
gone; in fact there was no' train to
take. Adams returned to Curlee's sal
o0 on Texas avenue near Jordan street
where he had slept Sunday night, and
there he met J. W. McNeal, who until
recently was employed as a detective by
the Kansas City Southern. He was
warmly greeted by McNeal, with whom
took a drink, in fact several drinks.
A little game was proposed, but McNeal
said he could not play as he had no
money but was willing to do his best if
Adams would stake him. Adams lost;
all the money in his, pocket was gone.
He pawned or sold his pistol and this
amount, $so, was soon out of his reach.
It was then that he rose from his seat
at the card table and with his hag - e
tited a short distance and called Mc
$oinl to T and to whom he dispam
his £o4 a taken
`l~ 'u ` us Simtla ` art
with ima at the seconid opening of the
bag for more gold. Adams pulled out a
handful of twenty-dollar gold pieces,
put them in his pocket, closed the bag,
which, he placed at his feet under the
gard table and resumed the play. In a
little while he felt for his bag; it was
gone. Then the cry qf alarm was raised.
It was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
On being advised of the robbery, Chief
Jeas hastened to the scene on harse
ba& He was soon joined by Deputies
Ward and Worsham, On his way to
Ciutiess5 Chief Jones urged sev l po
leemen to meet him at the saloon where
they ""pulled" J. W. McNeal, Al .Morri
son alias Sharkey, D. P. Corpla and
Gus Strickland, against whom there is
an indictment for robbing a man named
Hamilton in St. Paul bottom. Instead of
gold the police secured the empty bag
which had held Adams' money,' which
he would not leave at the bank or have
expressed, and which he alone could
keep safe and secure, etc. There can be
no pity .or sympathy for such a man,
but in the name of law and order it is
to be hoped .that the men who have
robbed Adams of his gold will be con
victed and sent to the pen.
WILSON DEAD
His Demise Occurred at the Charity
Hospital-He. Was shot in the
Hunter Hotel.
W. S. Wilson, the man shot Monday
morning in the Hunter hotel near the
Union Depot by Sergeant Gerald, died
at the hospital Friday morning at 2
o'clock from the effects of the wound.
An inquest was held by Dr. Coty, cor
oner, and developed no facts not alp
ready familiar to the readers of the
Caucasian. When shot by Sergeant
Gerald, Wilson. who is a stout anan,
was crazed with whiskey and had at
tempted to stab Officer Byland with a
knife. Wilson is from Alvarado, Tex.
He is married and leaves a good wife
and twelve children to mourn his loss.
He was on his way to visit relatives and
friends in Alabama when he stopped at
Shreveport and went to the Hunter
hotel. The body may be forwarded to
Alvarado for interment.
Sergeant Gerald was exonerated by
the jury.
The Boston Globe seems to think
there is something remarkable in the
fact that three German warshhips could
not silence Fort San Carlos iq three
days; yet there are some women whom
theaVy cosildn't silence
