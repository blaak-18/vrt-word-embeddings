New York, November 15.-Persons
o&kpegident Hayes' personal coteries,
in this city to-day, say that the re
cent news of his abandoning the non
interfereuoe policy in the South is a
misinterpretation of his avowal to
have the violators of the election
laws prosecuted in the Federal Courts
aid sent to the Penitentiary. eI,
plJtpnes to put on foot a series of
Ku-Klux prosecution's, without the
military repressive measures oince
adopted by Grant beforo the indet
ments. Governor Warmoth, of Lou
isiana, whose friend George A. SIhe i
dan is close to the President, said on
the subject as follows:
"llayes is right, and consistent,
too. nlodignant, lnut determined to
punish in the lawful way, lihe will he
aided by a white public seltitient.
The Citizens' party in New Orlehns
has been cheated as well as the lie
pobft~ al, and want satisfaction. The
Judges of the Fedesral Courts there
are dlt~j"1 men, and both Northern-
eres.* ,tfige Wodis was an Ohio Colo
nel of volunteers, and Junige Bil
lings is. from MassalchInsetts. T''ll
Judges' pay the Comrtnissioners who
will select the julies to try the ,thfl nd
eras.. ~hte District Attorney, Albeit
Leonard, is a native, an cx-.menmlheI
of hi., wli" Lo,,g.a and a Bill
dozer, but he ran for oflice a - ,,.
publican up in Caddo Parish, and
they coonted him out, too, so that he
is nmad as a hornet. Backed by a
consdlidllp lseutiment in New Or
leans, these' offlters- will liroset'clte
withiout fear or favor the heads of ithe'
lat4 t liti ,performithe, anl I Ihae
no' tiW t will send some of them to
the Penitentiary.
"Tire election was a sweeping out
llg. . Iq Tenuas Parish there had
unrer b: a scandal. The public
foeds:il v. : ver been stolen, and theI
eidtit-'i tiie parish obligations was
at 't ptellitiom. h'le''ere were 3,500
mltlk'ksthere, and ;300) whites. Miann
of tbe beat whiles were Republicans,
yet by bringing in armed militia coni
panie~ from Mississippi and killing 100
negroes, the parish is counted Deimo
eratic by 2,500 votes. Only one white
'gl 'lr t liT t is elected to the
Legislature, pnd that is myself. They
eat. nly niajority down to one fifth,
but knew that I would not stand a
countfng'out. Ilwyes, no' doubt,
