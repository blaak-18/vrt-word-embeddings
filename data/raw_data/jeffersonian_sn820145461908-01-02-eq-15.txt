General J. B. Hood testified his devotion
to the Southern cause by losing a leg at the
battle of Gettysburg and an arm at the bat
tle of Chickamauga. (In the old arm he was
severely wounded in an engagement with the

November of that same year, he fought the
bloodiest battle of the war, and then contin

practically destroyed by Thomas at Nash
ville. General Hood died at New Orleans of
yellow fever, as did also his wife and four
sons.
