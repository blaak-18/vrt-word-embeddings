nerve and ability than nlne-tenths of
its officials. While Grant was presi

of Itlchmond. General Grant never
deserted hlits friends. But after his
time the office was taken from her to

Dark days feil upon Miss Van Lew.
Piece by piece she sold the family sil

she mortgaged and parted with the fair
inheritance her father left her, and not

she starved or fed. She died neglected
and poor. Thus It Ia to be bomrn a wo

GOLFING COSTUMES.

do not care for such games I do at least
like the dresses and capes and jackets
and the lihats and the shoes and also the
bright and brisk, ready for anything
expression on the faces of the golf
eirlk
'ie needs of this game have been
productive in working wbat some call
reform in dressing for out of door
sports, for It Is not so very many years
ago that It would have been a scream
Ing farce to see girls try to play this
game and hold up their skirts so they
could move at all. Now see the neat
and natty short akirt, the mother of the
senslble and pretty ralny day skirt,
and that made especlally for pedestri
ans. The skirt is short and wide
enough. yet not too full. and is cut no
that it hapgs to perfection. It Is quite
fully ornamented by several rowr. of
stitebing. and it fastens so tliat nothing
*hort of an earthquake could tear It
loose. It has no ugly and Irresponsible
placket to come open. hiut just an open
ing In front which is fastened witb in
vistble buttons. Ond there are pockets
met where they are tbche most needed.
Some of the golfing skirts are plaid,
and others are in plain stuffa. It is dif
flcult to may which are the prettler, for
tastea differ. The walking skirts are, I
think. more refined in rough surfaced
plain stuffs. There Is suchb a choice of
them that no one need go witbout just
wbat she liken best. The rainy day
*kirt need not differ from the otbers at
all, for the material offered espeelally
for the raminy dag Is as far as appear
ances go exactly like the other goods,
only this has been rendered aier
proof by some kind of treatment while
the wool was yet in the yarn and un
dyed. This process is called cravenet
ting. and it Is put on everytbing now,
even efapes for mourning and some
sflks. It is said to be done by electric
Ity, but no woman cares what the proc
es? Is so long as it gives her cloth just
as bandsome as any in the market,
with all the best colorings. at the same
price. This makes a garment absolute
ly impervious to water, and as It has
not, been made so by rubber it does not
smell like those horrid abominations,
mackintosbes.
The swellest of the new golf suits
may have a cape in regulation style,
but the body is fitted with the smartest
of snug habit basques, with tiny tails
in the back, and there is a vest of figur
ed wool stuff in vesting cloth. The
jacket is of some warm and sofld mate
rial and Is finished like any jacket,
with close tallor stitching, and lined
with white or very light cloth, and this
is stitched with black silk as closely as
possible. There are cuffs to match. In
side the vest is a chemisette, and to
this a high collar ar il mannish tie. The
collar and cravat are made of silk and
arw very stylish.
Can we leave the golfing girl without
saying a word about her hat? No, or
at least I cannot. for the hat is the top
knot of all the costuine. Just now the
rikkitlkkl is the very swellest of all,
and what is not said in praise of those
knowing feit hats, with their bright
and pretty scarf or dotted or plaided
slik, would not make much of a book.
Feit hats made double and stitched
together in the same close lines as
those in the decoration of the rest of
her suit are the very hbst of all. These
are seldom bound and have the crown
dented In, and the drapery of the surab
design is preferred. The Persian de
signs are much liked, and so are the
plalds. The one in the illustration is of
feit stitched and trimmed with a stitff
@elf drapery and bow with ends.
