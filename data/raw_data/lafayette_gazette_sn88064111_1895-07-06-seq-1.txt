SEEKING TOdMANOWOS.
BY ALVINt I. SYDENIIAIL
In the land of the Shoshoneg, in the i
rugged valley east of the Teton range,
at the most silent hour of a night of 1
unearthly blackness. White Bull, the 1
medicine man, sat by the smoldering
embers of his fire, considering the i
question of selecting from the young a
warriors of his tribe a new war chief 1
who would be friendly to his personal I
interests.
Red Eagle, the old war chief, who 1
had three days before succumbed to 1
the displeasure of the Bad God by
dying of a fever, and was even now 1
being mourned among the pines on the 1
hillside, as the plaintive shrieks of 1
lamenting relatives borne on the night
wind indicated, had to be relaced; 1
and to replace a warrior who has led I
his people from victory to victory for 1
thirty summers is an act requiring the 1
most mature deliberation. Among the 1
young braves the two most eager for i
the election were Whirlwind and c
WVashakie, both brave warriors, and c
both far enough ahead of their com- c
petitors in deeds of blood and prowess I
to be considered the only rivals for the
position. 1
As White Bull was peering through a
ties folds of his blanket into the dying
embers, a hand stole through the flap 1
of the tepee, which was presently fol
lowed by the body of a young warrior, i
gliding serpentlike in from the dark- t
ness. I
"Whirlwind, son of the Gray Wolf,
what brings thee here?" asked White t
Bull, not deigning to move. "Hast I
thou not found the tomanocos?" t
"No, White Biuli. Four days have I c
lain at the top of the thunder-rock, s
naked and without food, yet I have
dreamed not. The Great Spirit has I
not revealed the secret of the to- a
manowos. Since breath went out of the a
body of old Red Eagle have I string- r
gled with Bad God, who is seeking to t
defeat me. But thy magic power, I
White Bull, can aid me much. Make a
me war chief of my people, and all my i
wealth is thine. Thou knowest the a
value of the ponies, and of the arrows, a
and of the furs." I
"The Whirlwind is a brave and well- a
spoken young man. White Bull re- 1
members his endurance in the sun
dance. (Go now secretly to the grave 1
of Red Eagle and wait until the c
White Bull comes. Let none of the i
women see thee." f
The young man threw himself to the t
ground and glided out at the opposite t
side of the tepee. No candidate for 1
the chieftainship will risk the danger 1
of returning upon his trail. It is an c
action suggestive of retreat. v
After some moments the medicine v
man struck sharply upon a toantom s
and shook the rattle at his girdle vio- c
lently. lie had not long to wait be- a
fore the flap of the tepee opened 1
again and a tall young man stood be
fore him. p
"Does WVashakie still desire to be c
war chief?" he asked, motioning the
young rnan to a seat upon the ground.
"Washakie, bravest of the Shoshones,
claims the right to be war-chief." a
"But thou hast no ponies to ride in t
battle. Thou comest not of the chief's f
blood. Thou hast married no daughter b
of a chief. By what right, therefore, a
dost thou aspire to this highest honor
of the tribe?" 1
"By the right of manhood. By my u
strong arm, by my swiftness, by my a
skill with the bow and tomahawk, and t
by my stealth and cunning, I have n
slain more enemies than any warrior h
of the tribe. The Bad Spirit can't q
cheat me. I shall be war chief, and e
thou shalt aid me, White Bull." c
"Good! but what hast thou now for
thy tomanowos?" u
•"The heart of a grizzly bear, the b
brain of a panther, the arrow-thorn a
that grows on the thunder-rock, the I
eye of a lynx, and the foot of a gray b
wolf."
"Good, my son; but it is not enough. t
White Bull, wisest of the Shoshones, u
alone knows the secret of the tomano- t
acos. He can take the young warriors S
to the spot, but they have not the cour- fi
age to follow. When they goto wrench t
the secret from the bowels of the earth, n
their blood becomes like water. HIast V
thou a nerve of iron? Wilt thou fol- '
low the White Bull into the country of a
the fire arrows-into the land of the V
Fire Spirit?"
"To any spot thou namest" a
"Then meet the White Bull at the 9
foot of the thunder-rock at sunrise. lIe o
will lead thee into the land of the Fire b
Spirit and iow thee the secret of the fi
tomonoaeos. E
An hour later Whirlwind, lying se- b
creted at the feet of the dead war V
chief, became aware that White Bull a
was beckoning him apart for a confer- A
ence. By sunrise he knew that the v
medicine man had set out for the land y
of the-Fire Spirit with Washakle, his ii
rival, in search of the secret tomanowcos, fa
and that upon the skill with which ''
he followed upon their trail, without h
being seen, depended his accession to

A 1-,
A rumor reached the tribe that thse
trio had gone far to the north to do
cide their claims to preferment.
When the medicine man entered the
Fire-Hole basin of the Yellowstone,
the full moon from mid-heaven was
flooding the cindered waste with a wan
radiance. Jets of steam from a
score of craters hissed and wreathed
around them, leaping and disappear
ing like specters at play. The hot
stones and ashes beneath their feet
trembled at intervals, as if to begin a
mimic earthquake, and then subsided
amid sharp explosions and sudden
hisses of steam that seemed to burst
from every pinnacle and projection of
the whitened area.
Before a dark opening that broke
the surface and seemed to pierce down
ward to the very bowels of the earth,
the medicine man stopped. Seizing
Washakie by the wrist, he bent for
ward and pointed into the heart of the
crater.
"There. WVashakie!" he cried, "there
is the heart of the Fire Spirit! White
Bull will let thee down by his pony's
hair rope until thy feet touch the
ledge of rock. Then put thy hands
out and walk straight forward until
they touch a substance that is warm
and smells like powder. That is the
heart of the Fire Spirit. then draw
the arrows from thy quiver and thrust
them in one by one until they are all
gone. The blood will run forth, soft
and warm. Gather it in thy hands
and fill the quiver. The hot breath of
the spirit will fill thy nostrils, but fear
it not. WVhen all is done, pull on the
rope, and White Bull will draw thee
up and lead thee back over the moun
tains to be war chief of the ! hoshones.
This deed has never yet been done by
man. Thou shalt be known as the
bravest warrior that ever led thy peo
ple in battle."
The young man hesitated, looking at
the flickering jets of steam leaping
from the broken surface of the basin
beyond; then he fell upon his face and
peered earnestly into the darkness of
the hole. Superstition, dread of the
mysterious Fire Spirit that no man had
ever yet conquered, filled him with un
certainty. But he believed the words
of the medicine chief of his tribe, who
had shown so many others the secret
of bravery; and the glory of leading
his tribe in war was worth an earnest
ness dumb to fear. He had trod the
forest many miles to find his tomnanowos;
his strong heart would not fail him
now. In another moment he was glid
ing over the edge of the crater with
the noose of the hair rope bound around
him.
The medicine man braced back until
the relaxing strain upon the rope told
him that Washakie's feet had touched
the ledge. Then he coiled the free end
of the lariat fast around a projecting
rock.
Whirlwind, arrayed in paint and war
bonnet, had crept through the forest
and over the mountain as closely as
safety permitted. At night his thrice
repeated cry of a cougar had warned
the medicine man- of his presence.
Reaching the edge of the fire basin,
and screening, himself behind a rook,
he saw the medicine man standing
alone amid the floating wreathes of
steam. lie saw him turn and lift a
heavy rock, struggle under its weight
a short distance, and heave it apparent
ly into the earth.
Then there was a rumbling as if a
hundred thunders had broken loose at
once. The medicine man retreated
hastily as a dense white cloud burst
from the earth at his feet and towered
to the very sky. The earth shook, and
there came out of the cloud a pro
longed, wailing cry, that was swal
lowed in an explosion as if the bowels
of the earth were rent in sunder. The
white cloud was transformed into
water, that shot upward in one mighty
stream toward the moon, piling volume
on volume, and casting itself in steam
and spray a hundred feet on every side,
like a giant fountain of silver.
When the great geyser had ceased to
play. Whirlwind stood beside the medi
cine man.
"WVhere is Washakie?" he asked.
"Where is the would-be war chief?"
"There," answered the medicine
man, pointing to an object lying near
the mouth of the crater. "He has
found the tomanorwos; bhut he pierced the
heart of the Fire Spirit with arrows,
and the Fire Spirit has slain him."
The water had subsided and fallen
back into the earth. WVashakie lay
upon his face, crushed and smothered,
as far from the crater as the length of
the lariat to which he was bound per
mitted the water to throw him. In
his right hand he still clutched the
quiver, half filled with re d, ochreous
earth. The medicine man had taken
care that the body should not be lost.
"RHere is the secret," he said, taking
up the quiver. "It is the blood of the
heart of the Fire Spirit. Whirlwind
shall be war chief of the Shoshones.
He shall wear the tomanowoa in his war
bonnet."
Casting the body of Washakie into
the crater, they turned their backs
upon the Fire-Hole basin and crossed
the mountains into the land of the
Shoshones. White Bull at the council
fire told of a fight between the
two rivals and the Fire Spirit, in
which Washakie had been slain, but
Whirlwind had come away victorious.
Then the crafty deed of the medicine
man was rewarded by the election of
Whirlwind as war chief
That summer, when he led his people
against the neighboring tribes, Whirl
wind placed the tomanowoe in the beak
of the eagle which crowned his war
bonnet. Though foremost among the
falling braves, he received no wound.
Bullets struck away the feathers of
his war-bonnet, his pony was killed,
the wings of the eagle were torn
away, but Whirlwind was not touched.
And until the ad Spirit swept the
valleys of Idaho with a plague twenty
years later, Whirlwind remained the
invincible war chief of the Shoshones;
for his people believed the tale which
White Bull had told of the power of
his tomanmoweo.s.-Lippincott's Magazine

aele Josh Reeslls a Remarkableo torm
of the Year 1860.
"There's been a scarcity of kind
ling-wood 'round here ever since the
woods took fire last fall," remarked
the grocer.
"What's the matter with the new
growth?" asked Jackson Somers;
"there's plenty of it, isn't there?"
"Yes, but 'tain't the right sort. Now,

"'Eh? What's that? Back in 1850,"
broke in UncleJosh, suddenly waking
up. "Why, I can remember it jest ez
though it wua yesterday. An', speak

"'obody said anything about storms,
Uncle Josh,," said Jackson, hastily.
Uncle Josh gave a look that silenced
him.
"Ez I wuz sayin', speakin' of storms,

COACHEE WAS A WIZARD.
But His nMagic Couldn't Keep Him Oat of
Jail.
Belief in the magic art is by no
means extinct in the department of the
Pas de Calais.
The latest sorcerer is a coachman,
who, by some peculiar process of rea
soning, is regarded by the ignorant as
a past master in the occult sciences.
One of his victims was a girl who
was extremely anxious to be wedded
to the object of her affection.
The young man could not be induced
to come forward, so she consulted the
jehu, who told her that she would be
married in the beginning of February.
She put a certain sum of money down
as an installment, and, although disap
pointed, was returning with the re
mainder when the police interfered and
arrested the jehu.
One venerable dame declared that
she was delighted with the magician,
as he evicted an evil spirit from her
habitation.
She had called on him with her
daughter. and he had told them that
the house was bewitched.
On the receipt of the sum of eighteen
francs the coachman paid her a visit,
and, after shutting himself up in the
stable for ten minutes, he emerged
with the joyful tidings that he had dis
covered a "'fatal toad" and had driven
it off the premises.
From that moment, the old woman
declared, she had been at peace, and
she wound up with the expression of
her gratitude and of her confidence in
the great sorcerer.
In answer to the questions put to him
the jehu said that he had learned it all
in a little book he had lost. There were
spells and incantations.
"Very good. Repeat one," said the
presiding judge.
"But they are in Latin," the man re
plied.
"Never mind; go on. We shall un
derstand all the same," exclaimed the
judge, encouragingly.
The improvised magician, however,
could not get out a word, but hung his
head amid roars of laughter, and soon
afterward he was sentenced to two
months' imprisonment. - London

THE BLESSING OF DEATH.
A Cheerful View of the End of 1Mandaste
Existence.
The truth is, that death, far from
being a misfortune to the race, is per
haps even to the individual the great
est of all earthly blessings, though it is
often enough a blessing very much dis
guised. For without death for finite
beings, there could be no growth, and
still more, no means of distinguishing
the.human characteristics which need
no growth, but, on the contrary, the
opposite of growth. The most wide
minded of the Apostles declared, and
declared in no vague and metaphorical
mood, that he died daily. "I protest
by your rejoicing, which I have in
Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily."
And another expression of his, most
startling, and vet most deliberate, was
to the same effect: "As dying, and be
hold we live, as having nothing and
yet possessing all things." What did
death mean to St. Paul? It meant sur
rendering the hold on all that his great
and passionate nature eagerly grasped
at, and yet gladly and loyally surren
dering it, when he felt that that in him
which was nearest to God required it
at his hands.
The true kind of death, which is as
essential to life as-to use our Lord's
own language-the death of the corn
or wheat is to its bringing forth much
fruit, is the giving up willingly what
seems to be of the very heart that is in
you, what it makes your head swim to
contemplate giving up, at the whisper
which claims it from you in the name
of Him who gave it. As the seed ap
pears to rot before it even begins to
grow, and to draw from earth and air
the constituents of its larger life, so
the mind appears to be closing its hold
on all that is most precious at the very
moment at which it is beginning to
learn most effectually how truly inval
uable it is. Death is, indeed, by' the tes
timony of all who have valued life as
they ought, one of the most unique of
its experiences. You loosen your grasp
on what is far more than yourself, and
only when you do so does it really be
come part of yourself. The senses
reel, the heart grows giddy, at losing
that which, till you have lost it-or at
least have gone through all the panic
of losing it-you never truly gained.
What we usually call death is only
the final and full consummation of this
process of loosening the eager grasp of
the wilful heart on possessions in the
pride of which it has seemed to become
its true self, though in reality it never
becomes its true self, and never really
possesses what it thinka it possesses,
till it has achieved the triumph of re
signing them and commanding even
its own spirit into the hands of Him
who gave it If we could indeed dis
cover what is undiseoverable, the true
"microbe of death," then, instead of
invoking the power of the expert to
extinguish it, we should regard it as
the most ineatimable of God's gifts.
But then it would be priceless not be
cause it is really the brink of the abyss
into which it seems to plunge us, but

FEMININE FASHIONS.
New Notions in the Department of Wom
an's Dress.
The special ambition of the average
woman is to get into her skirts some
cord or braid stiff enough to make
them stand out so as to give her as
nearly the shape of a pyramid as pos
sible. There are little strips of closely
woven fiber that are used for this pur
pose; but these break down and get
out of shape almost immediately. One
of the best arrangements is a hard
twisted cord stitched into a thick cot
ton band. Row after row of this is
put in, making a band something like
an inch wide. With a corder in the
sewing machine this is by no means a
long or difficult task. Another home
made device is strips of fiber-cloth cut
on the bias, folded over and stitched
through half a dozen times.
There is, however, very little need to
worry about spreading skirts, for it is
said that their doom is already sealed
in Paris, and that the limp and clinging
is to follow the recent spasmodic effort
to get as near to hoops as possible.
It will be a great blessing to feminini
ty when this flaring craze goes out, for
there is more vanity and vexation of
spirit to the square inch in these
spreading skirts than in anything that
has afflicted womankind for the past
decade.
The plain skirt remains, although a
few overskirts have made their appear
ance, and some draperies are already
on exhibition. But the handsome, se
vere plain skirt is too popular to be
easily pushed aside by more elaborate
effects. The markets are full of hand
some costumes. A dress of camel's
hair has nine gores in the skirt, and
each seam has a band of inch-wide gal
loon set over it. The waist is close-fit
ting, with very wide revers and a full
length vest that buttons under one
side or the front, the joining being en
tirely concealed.
There are little. pocket-lid shaped
basque skirts-a suggestion of the re
turn of the old-time short basque that
was, in many respects, the most desira
ble style that the majority of women
have ever adopted.
Sleeves are as large as ever, and some
authorities say they are still spread
ing. A new model has a trimming of
galloon set from wrist to elbow on a
leg-o'-mutton sleeve. The galloon
meets at the cuff and spreads as the
sleeve widens; the upper ends of the
strips are either turned in to form
points or the ends are doubled over and
make a loop, which is left loose for
about an inch and a half. The sleeves
of summer dresses will be trimmed in
this same fashion with ribbons about
half to three-quarters of an inch wide.
Although a great deal of summer sew
ing is already under way, the demand
for velvet would suggest autumn rath
er than spring.
There are full waists, jackets, collars
and capes of velvet, also enormous
quantities of velvet ribbon for trim
ming. Skirts have trimming of wide
bands made up of velvet ribbon of
graduated wicths. These are set on
about half an inch apart, and are very
pretty if the material on which they
are used is suitable. Velvet ribbon on
very thin fabrics should not be used,
although this is frequently seen, but
the most appropriate trimming for
such goods would be gauze ribbons or
some of the lighter weights of satin or
gros-grain.
Figured velvet is again popular, and
a very handsome dress is made of
crepe-wool goods and velvet brocade.
The combination is unique but very
stylish, and as the materials are han d
some. is necessarily very elegant.
Plaids are one of the new fads;
whether in wool, silk or velvet, the de
mand seems to be increasing. A hand
some costume recently made to order is
of putty-colored broadcloth and black
velvet. The skirt is of velvet, a broad
cloth front covered with cut-out velvet
embroidered in jet. The bodice is of
velvet with lapels and cuffs of cloth
and cut-work. With this dress there is
a rather deep velvet cape with two col
lars-a large one of cloth and open
work, the other of velvet, both being
elabqrately trimmed with jet. A ruche
of ribbon, closely plaited, finishes the
neck, and there are very long ribbon
ends and loops falling almost to the
hem of the skirt.-N. Y. Ledger.
Inexpenslve Fancy Waists.
Fancy waists may be made of some
brilliant-colored lovely creped cotton
goods, when a collar of silk or satin to
match is added. If a wide satin rib
bon hangs loosely from the collar to
the belt and handsome bows be set on
the shoulders, the general effect will
be of a rich silken garment. while the
price will be very different. Smoky
and cloudlike lawns are made up over
gray silk, the bodice to such a dress
being of pale yellow, with miles of
frills of the smoky lawn. Very deli
cate nainsook comes gathered at in
tervals into a series of tiny tucks, the
spaces between set with little nainsook
frills A half yard of such goods will
serve for a front to a bodice that at
first look will seem to have been the
result of patient hand labor. Little
frills of closely gathered lace are set
along all edges, and the edges of the
bands of ribbon that drape the fronts
of bodices are very often thus finished.

Home-Made Planeao Lamp.
There is really nothing the Amer
ican girlcan't do when she tries. For
instance, a couple of clever Washing
ton girls have actually made them
selves a piano lamp They have wvit,
they have the best of breeding, but
they haven't- money. A ready-made
piano lamp was beyond them, so they
set to work to manufacture one. First
they took three broomsticks and tiec
them together tripod fashion. These
they wrapped lightly with coarse cord
and fastened a flower pot at the top.
The whole was covered with innumer
able costs of black enamel paint, and
when the old brass lamp was fitted
into the pot, with an overgrown shade
to top off with, you'd have said the
lamp was the finest thing in wrought.

woman's magazine, but it isn't, It'

--Pope Leo XllI.'s hands are nearly

When he writes he must hold his right

-Cornell has tested the principle of
co-education twenty years, and proved
it a success. It is stated that the num

university has increased, so that the
accommodations in Sage Hall, the wom

enlarge the dormitory at an expense of
about p50,000.

question a year ago. He did say, how
ever, "'I have never been a user of to
bacco in any form; neither do I ev

received instead of the pledge. Bishop
Merrill, in speaking of the matter,
plainly indicated his opinion that the
question was one which had perhaps
better be unasked.
