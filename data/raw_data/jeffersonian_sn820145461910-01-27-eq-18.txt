HOLY HERB
The Yerba Santa, as the old
Mission Fathers of the West
named the “Holy Herb” of the In
dians, is hard to gather in its
mountain home, and has, there
fore, never been placed on the
market as a drug. Made into a
hot tea, it is palatable, and yet a
most marvelous remedy for colds,
coughs, fever, and even pneumo
nia. It warms quicker than whis
ky, and is absolutely harmless. So
destructive is it to the microbes of
disease that the Spanish mission
aries, seeing the wonderful cure
wrought by the Indian herb,
named it “Holy”,
If you have a cough, cold, fever,
trouble with your stomach or in
testines, send me a silver dime, or
ten cents in stamps, and I will
mail you a sample of the “Holy
Herb”. It can not hurt you, and,
if you follow the simple directions,
it will cure you.

VETERANS’ CORNER
OLD SOLDIERS HOLD SESSION.
Pat Cleburne Camp No. 88, U. C.
V., met in regular session in the
county court-room December 26,
1909, Captain T. N. Lawson, pre
siding.
The camp was opened with prayer
by Chaplain W. O. Menefee.
Officers present: T. N. Lawson, J.
B. Carnehan, W. J. Godsey, R. W.
Ferrell, IV. O. Menefee and H. W.
Barclay.
Members present: Pride, Bowen,
J. M. Crawford, Pope, Wilhart, Ja
cobs, Hampton, Wright, Davis,
Cyrus, Fields and Beckner.
The minutes of last meeting were

benefit of an indigent comrade.
Under the order for the good of
the camp, the following memorial
resolution was offered and adopted:
To the Officers and Members Pat
Cleburne Camp, No. 88, U. C. V.:
Whereas, Death has again entered
our camp and removed from dur
midst our esteemed friend and com
rade, James M. Mallett, a true
friend, a wise counselor, an upright
Christian, and faithful soldier. Cap
tain Mallett entered the army as
private in Company E, 41st Missis
sippi regiment, Anderson’s brigade,
Sharps’ division, Hindman’s corps,
Army of Tennessee, and rose through
all the grades to captain and was
continuously with that army and in
all of its battles from Corinth to
Greensboro, N. C., when the star of
the Confederacy went down to rise
no more.
When peace came, the war, with
Captain Mallett, was over, and from
that time to the close of his life
every talent and power he possessed
was exerted for the rehabilitation of
the Southern country by the promo
tion of those policies and practices
that make a section or a nation great.
He was a conscientious man; he
strove to be right; having carefully
weighed a proposition, he formed an
opinion, and stood by it regardless
of the popular opinion; he was will
ing to be with the minority if the
minority was right.
He was an unobtrusive Christian,
observing the rule of dealing with
men as he would have men deal with
him; therefore, be it
Resolved, That in the death of
Captain Mallett, the camp has lost
one of its truest and most valued
members and each of its members a
devoted friend, and that the sympa
thies of the camp be extended his
widow and all surviving relatives.
C. V. CYRUS.
R. W. FERRELL,
H. W. BARCLAY,
Committee.
On motion, the Adjutant was in
structed to send a copy of the above
resolution to The Jeffersonian, after
which many members spoke of their
love and respect for our dead com
rade, J. M. Mallett, and with sad
hearts all submitted their will to the
will of Him who doeth all things
well.
By order of the Commander the
camp was closed with a prayer by
Comrade C. V. Cyrus.

AN OLD CONFED. YANKEES
SHOT HIM LOTS, BUT COULDN’T
KILL HIM.
Dear Sir: —I know you, because I
have seen your picture and read your
writings. I know how you have been
flayed and quartered, but still you
are a man amongst men, head and
shoulders above some men who have
bigger jobs.
Well, I have been a little of every
thing, too, from an ox driver down
to a mail ’carrier, but about the big
gest I ever was, was a Confederate
soldier, fighting around Atlanta,
J)efJer.suatuii
Nashville, Mobile; Chickamauga and,
in fact, anywhere Bragg,' Johnson
and Hood said fight. Johnson was
the idol of the Tennessee army.
Hood didn’t have more strategy
than a rabbit; when he came to an
obstacle he simply said, “Now, boys,
it’s up to you to charge those breast
works, or take that battery,” so at it
we went.
Well, the Yankees shot me some,
but they couldn’t kill me. The good
Lord didn’t will it so. They got
next to me at Chickamauga, when
one of my legs weakened and I went
down, but I got over that and fit
them more. Well, you see from this
scroll I haven’t got any education.
I was getting it from an Irishman,
when the war interfered. After the
war I went home with nothing, and
ain’t got much yet, except ten
healthy children able to scratch for
themselves.
I like The Jeffersonian and the Is
sue, they sound good to me. I like
to read after men who can hew to
the line regardless of the chip’s. I
don’t know but what I’ll try to bor
row the money and try them a while.
Well, I will soon be past my sev
entieth mile-stone and haven’t been
chloroformed yet. What a crank to
want men chloroformed at a certain
age. These same men are the most
intelligent, for they have the book
of experience to add to their text
books.
I guess you have read how the
boll weevil and the September storm
devastated this part of the country.
The country is still demoralized; la
bor gone, etc. Well, I believe I have
been of service to my country; fought
for it four years, raised ten chil
dren, etc., etc.
Well, I guess this enough from the
sticks in Louisiana.

CORRECTION NEEDED IN FORM
ER LETTER FROM A FED
ERAL VET.
Dear Sir:—Will you please correct
a mistake which occurred in my last
letter in The Jeffersonian for Janu
ary 6th? I don’t know whether I
made the mistake, or the printer, but
at least I meant to say that the
Catholics got from SSOO to $1,500 to
enlist, and they deserted, changed
their names and enlisted again and
got another bounty of SSOO to $1,500,
and some were shrewd enough to get
away five or six times without being
caught. And now these very same
scoundrels are drawing from sl2 to
S3O a month, and are fed and cloth
ed by the Government, besides being
furnished a fine home, which they
never had before.
I heard one of these very same
imps of Rome say that “The time
will soon come when we will wade
knee deep in Protestant blood. This
is our country and our home, and we
are going to have it.” I believe he
came very near telling the truth. Me
thinks they have got it without firing
a shot. At least it begins to look
that way to a man up a tree.
