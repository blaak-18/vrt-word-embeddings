In this day of specialists when
every man makes a specialty of some
subject, it is naturally evident to the
lay mind that a" Cancer, Blood and
Dropsy Specialist is a man that has
made a specialty of these subjects.
If you are a sufferer of Cancer,
Dropsy or any diseases of the blood
you would not consult an oculist
would you? Then, if you are afflict
ed with any of these dreaded dis
eases, why not consult a man whose
remedy first cured himself, and was
then offered to the world? This
remedy is manufactured and sold by

Some Sound Logic on Increased
of Living
Reasons are flying thick and fast
nowadays, from pedantic professors
of political economy in our colleges,
politicians and subsidized newspa
pers, as to the increased cost of liv
ing. Vacuous sophistry and glib
tongued knavery have advanced
about every theory under the sun to
explain the wild saturnalia of hold
up prices facing the consumer. Our
urban centers are attracting and de
populating the farming districts, lack
of intensive farming is creating un
der-production, extravagance and
wastefulness on the part of the
housewife is emptying the pantry,
cold storage sharks are cornering the
market, wholesalers and retailers are
hatching iniquitous combination,
gold overproduction has cheapened
its purchasing power, and the Lord
knows what not. Later on Halley’s
comet will make its appearance, and
most likely some superstitious fanat
ics will adduce another reason. And
just to think, the tariff was, REVIS
KI) but a few short weeks ago! Did
ever effect follow cause with such
lightning-like rapidity and death
like certainty? And, yet, flabber
gasted dupes that we are, we smile
at the children of the classic age,
who, in their efforts to connect cause
with effect, associated Aeolus with
the wind and Neptune with the wave.
Quite recently Mr. Henry Cabot
Lodge said there was no such crea
ture as the “ultimate consumer.” He
has once more disturbed the slumbers
of Socrates, and here is what the
oracular Henry Cabot chirps:
"There are only three countries
in the world that have edible ani
mals to export—this country, Aus
tralia and the Argentine. Now, that
being the case, the mere removal of
the duty will not affect the price of
the beef. We can not import beef
from countries that have no surplus
to export. We are the exporters of
beef.”
O, the literary charlatan and mis
erable political fraud. If there is no
beef imported into this country, then
why was a tariff duty ever imposed
and why is it now retained? As is
thoroughly known to the gentleman
from Massachusetts, there is a very
substantial reason—the CONGRES
SIONAL LOBBY maintained by the
Beef Trust to debauch the Repre
sentatives of the people and tax their
living necessities. Go, Henry Cabot
Lodge, and churn out some more of
those wishy-washy books for the
edification of New England beldames
and cease disgusting us with your
hypocritical twiddle-twaddle.
Here, also, is a cute little epigram,
“The trouble is not so much the high
cost of living as the cost of high liv
ing.” Who do you think got that
off? Why, James J. Hill! Shades
of Lazarus! this from the lips of
Jim Hill, the money-mad, railroad
monopolist, who clutches in his ava
ricious claws a public utility, levies
tribute upon a trust-ridden people,
and then hurls such a lying insult
into their teeth. Confound his in
solence.
And along comes Mr. Taft, with
his administration owls hooting in
harmony, proclaiming that the vast
over-production of gold is responsi
ble for the trouble. Alas, have all
the spread-eagle speeches of William
McKinley, Mark Hanna and the other
spellbinders about SOUND MONEY
come to this! Mr. Taft’s statement
is not only inconsistent, but it is ab
solutely false. The men who own
the gold mines control the national
banks, and any one half-way familiar
with the past history of the finan
ciers under our infamous banking
system, knows that they will never
permit the money circulation to re
spond to the natural laws of demand
and supply. No, the gold is in the
strong-box of the Money Trust. There
it will stay until Mr. Morgan slides
down to Washington, splits a bottle
of champagne with your Secretary of
the Treasury and has a sociable little
chat with your President. Then he
w|ll shake the dust of Washington
Glje Jeffersonian
off his feet, with pockets bulging out
with fat, juicy, 4 per cent, gold
bonds, lick his chops, look wise, and
quietly grease the track for another
bond issue. And we call ourselves
the shrewdest people in the world!
Would you know the truth? Well,
you shall learn it from the mouths of
—not babes—but TRUST MAG
NATES themselves. Mr. Henry O.
Havemeyer, the Sugar Trust King,,
and Mr. Charles M. Schwab, of the
Steel Trust, testified before the Con
gressional Committee, and following
are extracts from their testimony.
Said Mr. Havemeyer:
"THE MOTHER OF ALL TRUSTS
IS THE CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL.
The existing bill (Dingley) and the
preceding one (McKinley) have
been the occasion of the formation
of all the large trusts, with very
few exceptions, inasmuch as they
provide for an inordinate protec
tion to all the interests of the
country, sugar refining excepted,
in fact, the tariff bill clutches the
people by the throat, and then the
governors and attorney-generals
of the several States take action,
not against the cause, but against
the machinery which the people
employ to rifle the public’s pock
ets. Without the tariff I doubt if
we should have dared to take the
risk of forming the trust.”
Here are some responses made by
Schwab:
Q. —Is it a fact generally proved
of all exporters in this country
that they do sell at lower prices
in foreign markets than they do
in the home markets?
A.—THAT IS TRUE, PERFECT
LY TRUE.
Q. —Would you say that when
business is in a normal condition
the export prices are regularly
somewhat lower than home prices?
A.—OH, YES; ALWAYS.
We need look no further for the
cause of high prices. Here we have
it in a nutshell.

THE SPIRIT OF MARK HANNA
MARCHES ON.
The gallant Tom Watson, of Geor
gia, has called down upon his head
the vitrolic effusions of “Marse
Bunck” and the entire editorial staff
of the “Co-Operator,” because he has
turned the calcium on the merchant
marine (alias ship subsidy) resolu
tion ingeniously introduced and pass
ed at the last State Convention of the
Farmers’ Union at Galveston.
In his usual vigorous way Mr. Wat
son uncovers the real purpose of the
Merchant Marine Association, show
ing its connection with the ship sub
sidy bills which have been before
Congress, and its corrupting lobbying
methods, and then proceeds to casti
gate certain Union officials and news
papers who are using their columns
to boost the merchant marine, and
forthwith the “Co-Operator” blubbers
over in a scurrilous attack on Mr.
Watson, as an excuse for its own at
titude.
It comes with very poor grace for
a farmer’s paper to belittle and be
smirch the work and character of one
of the most constant friends the farm
ers have ever had, both in Congress
and as editor of his great Jefferson
ian.
But the name and good works of
Tom Watson will live on in history,
long after these little pygmies have
been forgotten.
Some day the farmers of this na
tion will erect a monument to the
honor of Watson, the man who was
the author of the bill which gave
them the R. F. D. system.
The attack on Tom Watson by the
“Co-Operator” is wholly inexcusable,
for Watson has for months been giv
ing the officials and papers generally
a chance to say whether or not they
stood for the merchant marine (alias
ship subsidy), but instead of plainly
stating whether or not they stood for
it, they have turned their wrath upon
the people’s constant friend.
Surely the spirit of Mark Hanna
goes marching on.—The Union
Guide, Houston, Texas.
