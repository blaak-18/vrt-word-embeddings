vertise somebody’s antidote for
drunkenness quite as promiscuously
and as well guaranteed to make him
sober as the whiskey is to make him
drunk. They print the sermons of
Pastor Russell, of Brooklyn Taber
nacle, masterpieces of their kind,
the whiskey ad. and the antidote on
the same page, a matter of business
only? Sure; a matter of money?
Certainly.
Then what matters it if my neigh
bor’s boy goes to the devil if his go
ing increases my bank account? Is
it none of my business? Don’t tell
me so, because when you want me
to subscribe you say your paper has
influence, has future public opinion
in the formative state. If that is
true as you say, and we admit it,
then your intention is for public
opinion to take the jug along. Why
argue prohibition to every subscriber
and then ask them in to have a drink
and see for themselves how mean it
is? Take a cut-rate quantity, get
extra drunk, form that habit and
thereby learn without taking my
word for it how much damnation
there is in it. It is up to your boy
to be man enough to quit, and should
he be too weak he would not be
much of a man any way—hasn’t
enough gum in him. This is the ac
tion and it speaks for itself.
Yours truly,

FROM A PRIMITIVE BAPTIST
PREACHER.
Dear Bro. Watson:—This is my
“Jeffersonian day.” The day that I
receive The Jeffersonian is spent in
reading it. It gets better with each
issue.
I am especially pleased with your
editorial headed “Men and Brethren,
we Must Organize Against the
Heathenites.” Like you, I think
that in the Jeffersonian Clubs would
be a good place to discuss these
things. I am not a member of any
Jeffersonian Club, —because I have
had no chance to join one.
I expect soon to start out to fill
some appointments, preaching alone
on the mission question.
I will mention, incidentally, that
you are almost on a Primitive Bap
tist platform in your mission views.
A great many of our people—Primi
tive Baptists—who, though they
were not agreed with you in politics,
have been reading your Foreign Mis
sion articles with great interest, and,
of course, they see your other arti
cles, and find that your theories of
government are right.
You spoke of “The Primitive
Baptist,’’ a paper published at Mar
tin, Pa. Do you get “The Pilgrim’s
Banner,’’ of Graymont, Ga., and
“The Baptist Light,” of Savannah?
They, and especially the Banner,
which is some seventeen years old,
will give you a correct idea of the
belief of the Primitive Baptists of
the South. The Banner is consider
ed the best paper that we have in
the South. Os course, I don’t mean
by this to say anything against the
“Primitive Baptist” of Martin, Tenn.
If you think that I could do any
good, in such a tour as I mentioned
above, preaching on the mission sub
ject, I would be glad to hear from
you.
Yours in earnest,
W. B. SCREWS.

LIKES TO READ LIVE ARTICLES.
Dear Sir: —It thrills me with de
light to know that the Southern
States have one editor who has the
manhood to stand up for right, de
nounce rascality and openly fight
trusts and combinations.
Wishing you the greatest success
with your work, I am

THE CHATTANOOGA PURCHASE.
Thomson, Ga., April 4, 1910.
Mr. Jas. J. Slade,
Columbus, Ga.
Dear Sir: —I submitted your se
vere criticism of the Macon Tele
graph to Mr. Pendleton, and in re
ply, he states that the only error in
the article was as to the number of
acres in the proposed Chattanooga
purchase. This mistake he correct
ed more than once. The Attorney-
General has passed upon the matter
of the Governor’s option in the prem
ises; and the construction which the
Attorney-General has given to the
law is indorsed by Senator Longley,
who declares that his intention was
to put the whole matter in the hands
of the Governor. The diagram pub
lished in the Telegraph is sufficient
proof that if the Governor had closed
the bargain for the forty acres, and
the seventeen and one-half acres,
there would have been left—in be
tween the two lots—a triangle of
land not included in the option, and
the owner of the triangle which is
necessary to the use of those two
lots, could have held up the State
for any amount that he desired.
Yours very truly,
THOS. E. WATSON.
AN ENERGETIC LETTER FROM
AN 83-YEAR YOUNG MAN.
Dear Sir: —I think now is the time
to call a meeting of committee to get
to work. Have Paul Dixon come out
as a candidate for President; let him
make his own platform; let the
President of the Farmers’ Union be
second on the ticket. Hearst will
make a stir with his new party. Let
us get ahead of him. Do as you
think best. Let Dixon be an inde
pendent candidate. We will try and
have the West and South unite on
him. Nine out of ten here is down
on the East. I have talked with one
hundred men, only found two that
favored the East. I got 150 names
to petition and question every man.
The Monetary League is dong busi
ness here, getting names on petition.
I have not been well this winter, as
my eighty-third winter is telling on
me.
Your sincere friend,
S. M. LANGDON.

THE JEFFERSONIAN WAS INTER
ESTING TO THIS MAN.
My Dear Sir:—Your weekly issue
of this date to hand, and is a gem
of the “jeems dandy” variety, and
no mistake. The scalding you give
the South Carolina Senator and his
son is a condensed classic of the
“purest ray serene” without a
break or a blemish. It is a Sunday
sermon in itself. It is worth the
cost of both Jeffersonians for a
whole year. No pure-minded man
or woman can read it without think
ing less of Tillman and more of you.
In this issue, you seem to embrace
the earth and then skim the horizon
for more material. The truth is,
your readers get more for their mon
ey than any other similar class of
readers in the world.
Please send me by express C. O.
D. the two bound volumes of your
Magazine f6r 1907, price $2.
As ever yours,
Macon, Ga. W. A. HUFF.
ENJOYS MR. WATSON’S BOOKS.
Dear Sir: —I have received and
read your books, “Waterloo”, “Beth
any”, “Napoleon” and your “Life
and Speeches”. All are of a high
order, but I wish to say to you that
your own life has more to inspire
me to put forth my best efforts, to
do good and help in the struggle
for equal opportunities to all men.
I shall pass your “Life and Speech
es” along among the young men of
my community, and feel assured that
Jeffersonian
wherever its teachings (seed) fall
upon good ground, they must bear
a bountiful harvest.
Very truly, S. C. ADAMS.

SOUTHERN MAN ENDORSES SO
CIALIST EDITORIALS.
Dear Sir:—lt was my privilege to
read your February issue of The
Jeffersonian Magazine. I must say
that your editorials on Socialism are
the best I ever read.
I am glad to know that there is
one man in the South that does not
sniggle over, and court favors, from
such degenerates, that put a negro
on an equality with themselves, and
better than their fathers. Any
Southern man that knows anything,
will readily agree that what you say
of the negro is true.
I shall be a constant reader of
your publication in future. If it is
convenient, will you send me a copy
of your reply to Booker Washing
ton’s article on the subject that the
negro had progressed more in forty
years than the white man in two
hundred. Wishing you much suc
cess, I am, Yours very truly,
Richmond, Va. LEE TODD.
FOR THE 100,000 MARK.
Dear Mr. Watson:—We are doing
our best to scatter The Jeffersonian
all over this country. We are anx
ious to see it reach the 100,000 mark,
when you and the namesakes will be
off to Yellowstone Park.
We find that wherever we can get
your publications placed, they do the
work. Os course, we sometimes find
a man who was born with more
prejudice than brains that can’t stand
your plain way of talking, but in the
main the man who has intelligence
enough to appreciate a wide-awake,
up-to-date, progressive paper, after
once being a subscriber to yours, will
always be. With best wishes, we are
Very truly yours,

LABORING PEOPLE PAY FOR
FOREIGN MISSIONS.
Dear Sir:—l have just read your
exposition upon Foreign Missions as
now practiced upon the laity of the
church, and, while I have not just
now waked up to its reality, must
say that the masses should feel them
selves under lasting gratitude to you
for uncovering the uncalled for
speculation and grinding the face of
the common laboring people of
America to build up institutions,
clothe and feed the Africans, besides
educating them to a better qualifica
tion to trample our institutions and
the prileges of our sons and daugh
ters into the dust.

THE JEFFERSONIANS, Thomson, Ga.
The common people were fully as
ignorant about what Congress was
doing before you became $ member
as the laity of the church was about
what the Foreign Missions were do
ing for both Church and State.
I don’t see you after any but
“transgressors, whose way is hard,”
and God help you to make it still
harder for them.
You can find a time when men
would not “endure sound doctrine.”
