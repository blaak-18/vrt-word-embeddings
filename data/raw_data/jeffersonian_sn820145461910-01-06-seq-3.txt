to the columns of the Union News.
But that did not down me. After
waiting patiently for a long while,
and not seeing my communication in
the Union News, I mailed it to the
Courier-Dispatch, of Dublin, Ga., and
Hal. Stanley gave it a prominent
place. There is nothing in the
above, except to show that Mr. Duck
worth is not willing to tote fair, and
has an inclination to stoop, if neces
sary to carry his points. And, again,
our quarterly dues were raised forty
per cent, at a State meeting this fall.
I am not grumbling at the raise, but
the way it was done. It was put be
fore the locals to be voted on, with the
proviso that all members who were
absent when the vote -was taken
would be counted as voting for the
raise. All of our locals that were
present voted almost unanimously
against the raise. And I guess many
locals in the State voted likewise.
And yet we learned from Union City
that the measure was overwhelming
ly carried. I do not believe,there is
an honest man in Georgia who will
agree that it was fair to count any
man for it who did not vote. I am
highly in favor of the Farmers’ Un
ion. But I am unalterably opposed
to leaders who won’t tote fair. Now,
a man who joins the Union to line
his pockets, and for nothing else,
needs to be watched. I look upon
the Union News as our paper, kept
alive by Union subscribers, and I
never will concede the right to Mr.
Duckworth, or any other editor, to
suppress, or garble, a worthy contri
bution, solely because the writer dif
fers with the editor.
I also saw a man in Adrian, not
many days since, who feels himself
under lasting obligations to you for
your letters through the Jefferson
ians on Foreign Missions. Said man
is a cripple, and is not physically
able to support a family. Some of
the cripple’s near relatives have
plenty of means, and have been lib
eral contributors to Foreign Mis
sions. They have also been reading
the Jeffs, which has caused them
to open their eyes and turn their
gifts on their poor, needy, worthy
relative at home, instead of squan
dering it among the Chinese and nig
gers. They did not only give him
freely of their substance, but they
told him what caused them to do it.
And the above are not the only peo
ple in Georgia who approve and en
dorse your missionary views. Many,
yes, very many, of us are ready to
exclaim: “Me, too;” “lay on, Mac
duff!”
Yours truly,
J. B. HOWARD.

John Lee’s Folly
Dear Sir:—The way Mr. Lee, the
President of the Farmers’ Union, has
attacked you reminds one very much
of a man defending a feeble wife
against her “brutal husband;” she
immediately attacks her would-be de
liverer, while the guilty husband
slouches away.
As soon as you exposed the guilt
of the Neal Bank defaulters, the man
Representing the very class of people
shorn you are trying to shield imme
diately attempts to take the fight on
his shoulders and allow the guilty
ones to escape behind his back.
Am right with you on the Mission
question.

They Will Not Answer
Dear Sir: —I am well pleased with
The Jeffersonian. I see you have a
hot combat with the State officials,
or a part of them. Put it to them!
I have been following them for some
time, as I did the Alliance, and I can
tell a whole lot. They are making a
big tour, lecturing and trying to
make asses of us, and not making a
failure. I have heard every one that
has come to our county, and I have
not gained anything yet. I am very
much displeased.
I have written them, and they will
not answer my questions. Put it to
them! I have been reading Duck
worth’s paper two or three years, and
am now out; I have been reading
yours for about eighteen or twenty,
and am yet in. Let her come. As I
can’t talk much, I will close. I am
chairman of Turner County Union, a
tiller of the soil.

“Wake Up, Brothers!”
Dear Sir: —I want to congratulate
you for the manner in which you are
exposing the rascality that’s being
practiced by certain would-be bosses
in the Farmers’ Union. We had a
live local of over forty members, but
the political trickster, the machine
ring, the warehouse bale-picker,
agents of the big cotton speculators,
and many other evils, crept in, so the
result is our local is dead. I hope
every reader of The Jeffersonian will
lend a hand in fighting that treach
erous Central Bank scheme; it’s no
trouble to get signers to petitions,
but if we sit idly by, old Aldrich and
his henchmen will get in their dirty
work to our sorrow.
You had better wake up, brothers,
and look after your business before
it’s too late.
Yours truly,
L. KING.

TH* Jeffersonian
I had a talk with J. L. Lee on the
19th of November. I told him that
I had never caught you in a falsehood,
and, therefore, I was standing by you
for justice. If we have got traitors
leading us, if we don’t get them out
of the Order they will ruin it. Don’t
be uneasy, for I believe our people
will see you have a fair fight. As to
my part, it has got to be done.
One of your best friends,
W. P. WHITE.

What Are They Hiding ?
My Dear Sir: —Enclosed find check
for SI.OO. Credit me with that
amount on subscription to Jefferson
ian. Mark my subscription back so
as to include all those articles con
cerning Messrs. Duck-son, Lad-worth,
and Katzenjammer. Also, keep it up.
It’s most too good to be true. A few
of us Union men have undertaken to
do the same thing that you are doing,
but have been called traitors for our
pains.
Read Clipping Attached.
I am taking the liberty of enclosing
a clipping from a letter received to
day from a friend, who is inclined to
be somewhat more conservative than
I, but who sees and knows things as
they are. When you run out of soap,
I may find soihe means of giving you
an additional supply. I am only
afraid that you have not covered
quite enough territory in your re
marks.
Very truly,
L. W. JARMAN.
A series of roasts of “the firm of
Duck, Ladson, and Boodlehamer.” I
have received only three copies yet,
but they are racy. I have clipped his
articles on the subject. Get the paper
if you do not now take it. Tom says
he is going to howl until some investi
gation is made, and I see some locals
are falling into line. If he knew of
some of the things we know of he
would raise the devil, I guess. A cer
tain amount of “raisin’ hell” enough
to cause some reformation is advis
able, but if everything could be laid
bare I am afraid the rank and file
would gag and the organization would
go to the wall. I believe in saving an
organization, if possible, even if we
have to put up with some graft and
lots of “damphoolishness.” A new
organization could not be gotten to
gether in our day and generation of
usefulness. The Union is doing some
good. That all it does is good lam
not prepared to admit. I will not
even express myself on the ratio of
the good to the evil, but content my
self with insisting that it is doing
some good. I want our people to con
tinue to receive the good, and trust
that the organization can some time
be rescued and put on a higher plane.
The task will be to keep inside the
fellows who “get wise” until there are
enough of them to influence things.
Getting disgusted and quitting is
only playing into the hands of any
grafters who may exist. “The mills
of the gods grind slowly,” you know,
and patience is one of the Christian
virtues.
