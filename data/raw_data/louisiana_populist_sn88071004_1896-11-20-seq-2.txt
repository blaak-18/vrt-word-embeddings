(Gen. E. W. Pettus has been 1
elected to the U. S. Senate from
Alabama to succeed Senator Jas,
L. Pugh, and A. S. Clay from
Georgia to succeed Gen. J. B.
Gordon. Both are free silver
Democrats.
Geo. Weyler has at last learned 1
that bluff and false reports of im
aginary victories, will not win in 1
Cuba, and his government is about '
to demand his return to Spain, or
some tangible results of the war.
So the old butcher has taken the I
Sold in person, backed by nearly 1
2')0,000 men, for the purpoee of 1

Business Revival.
We have a glorious story to tell
this week. From all over the land
conic accounts of a revival of bu
siness and industry. From Maine
to California, there is an increased
activity in all kinds of business,
trade, work, manufacturers of all
sorts. With every tick of the
wires, the glorious news comes in
and falls upon our ears like the
laughing waters of the Minnehaha.
The tin bucket brigade has taken
up its march and the hosts of want
are fleeing in dismay. We do not
know how long it will last, but
while it lasts .it will bring joy to
thousands and thousands of homes
The cloud of distress are lifting.
Town and country are putting on
a new industrial garb and smiling
confidence, like a messenger from
heaven, bids every one to the wed
ding feast of prosperity.-Mon
roe Bulletin.
We have noticed in our exchang
es from the manufacturing and
business centers, the news of open
r ing mills and business revivals that
Sis encouraging.
This is an evidence of the fact
the few financial magnates who
control the money supply of this
country, are thoroughly satisfied
= with the election of McKinley,
° and hence are investing their hoard
3 ed millions.
This will mare money matters
easier and restore a little of their
Slost value to property and labor.
If this revival to business and
employment of idle labor, and
3 consequent increased consumption
of farm products, does not raise
prices of eare in time to benefit
t our farmers this season, it will at
r least make money for farm purcha
see and for the purchase of sup
e plies and implements with which to
produce another crop so much
Seasier to obtain that business in
that direction will experience a
much needed revival and our farm
ing interets will Sourish.
While we know this prosperity
is only for S or E years at beat,
j and that then the shylock and plo
tocrats an and will make another
Spanic, and dash our prosperity to
,the earth upon the least probabili
t ty of a change in the fimancial sys
tem looking to the restoration of
this power to the people, yet we
B ought to accept this temporary
prosperity in good faith, aid it all
r in our power and make the mosat
- of it for ourselves and the coan
*try.
f It will give a breathing spell to
the people, sad enable them to
Srestore some of the losses of the
past years, and thus strengthen
them for the great struggle for
finauial freedom that must be
fought out b fore we are again a
r free psople,

Special to the P(uPrL'LrT.
Washington, Nov. 13, 1896.
In the peculiar and marvelous
campaign just closed the Relpubli
caus won by a margin so narrow
that it must be extremely unlcon
fortable to them, in view of
the tremendous efforts and imn
mense amount of money put for
ward. It is interesting to note
that twenty-five thousand more
votes given to Bryan, and proper
ly distributed in certain States
would have made him President of
the United States. It is clear that
the cause for which he stands will
gain ground steadily every day.
Therefore, the people have nothing
to do but to press forward in their
righteous cause and victory will
surely reward their efforts in 1900.
Chairman Butler says that the
People's party has come out of
this campaign in better shape than
any other party in the contest. He
points to the tact that thousands
upon thousands of so-called Dem
ocrats of the regularity stripe have
voted for Bryan, or claimed to
support him, yet, who are evident
ly glad of his defeat. These gold
bugs and monopolists in duisguse
will, of course, at once go to work
and try to capture the machinery
of the party. If they tail they
will go to the Republican party in
the next contest. If they succeed,
a very large element of the real
silver men in the Democratic par
ty will surely join the People's
party. Besides, McKinley's bare
ly won election could not have been
secured, in spite of the tremen
dous efforts and money put for
ward by the Republican party,
had the patriotic rank and file of
the Republican party who are op
posed to monopolies and trusts,
and who are in favor of the free I
coinage of sliver, not made up their
minds to stay just one more time
in the old party to which they have
long belonged, and which they
loved beeasec the name of Lincoln
is connected with its birth. This
cl as of Republicans will revolt
against McKinley before 1900, as
the patriotic rank and file of the
Democratic party have revolted
against and repudiated Cleveland
ism. These men will naturally
come to the People's party, and
thousands of them would have done
so in this campaign had the fight
against the gold standard been
made under the People's party
banner. It is very hard for a Re
publican, however strongly he may
oppose the policy of the Republi
can party to fight under the Dem
ocratic banner, however much he
may favor what it claims to stand
for. The hope of the country in
the future is in the patriotic rank
and file of the Republican party.
It is as certain as anything can
be in politics that these men will
line up solidly with the People's
party in 1900.
The People's party in this past i
campaign has risen to a beight of
patriotism and devotion to the I
cantd of good government which 7
has won for it the admiration, res
pect, and confidence of all good I
citizens. It has not only acted in I
a patriotie manner, but It has
shown the very shrewdest kind oft
political management, beeause the a
future of the party depends upon
how many aocessions it can bring
to its rankL If it had not taken
the patriotti stand in this cam
p.ign that it did, it is cl tat ita I
never could have gained reoruits
tfrom either the Democratic or Re.
publian party, bat new it stands
in a commaling and enviable po
s-tio. Besides, at has sacomplih
ed no little nr the shape of practi

and has partial control of the 8tate
government in a number of other
States. In addition to this, it
wouald have had the balance of
power in the eleetoral college in
the event of Brya's election.
Chairman Batler says that the
party will proceed to psh It or-i
ganisatioa vigorously and wills
keep ap a coastant and aauneasing
emapaign for the aext four years.
He says that headquarters will be
kept open in Washbingt, and that
the Nationali Committee and States
Committees will keep in close I
teach, and face the plans of MLark
Hanna and the gold men at ey
tarn. He says that te PeopleI
party will lead the fight in 1900

from these parishes were pitiful
indeed, and deeply affected the
Governor and Auditor Heard, wto
S accompanied him.
It was learned that 300,000) bush
I el of corn and some meat, cost
ing at least $100,000 will be requir
C ed as charity, and 400,000 bushels
r more to be furnished at a low price
to those still able to buy a little.
SGuv. Foster thinks it best fo
f the State to supply the entire
Samount, and will at once corres
a pond with the members of the
- Legislature to get their consent to
Ssan appropriation of $100,000 for
this purpose, and will send the
. Commissioner of Agriculture and
: one other person to corn centers of
the West to get the lowest possible
figures on the corn and meat nec
essary to be bought. The rail
roads have about all consented to
I bring it free of freight charges,
and thus save the State and the
people a big item.
Thus will the effects of a great
calamity be averted and actual suf
fering prevented, and Gov. Foster
f will deserve, and no doubt enjoy
" great credit for the very effective
and business like manner in which
he is handling a great question.
A Christmas Trip.
The thousands of Texans who
came from the South Atlantic
States find much pleasure in revert
ing to the happy days of long ago
when they were children, and of
ten they awake at night to recall
those scenes of yore which gave
to life a charm, and which now
come in later years as visions of
joy. There is a tender spot in
every heart for the old home, and
the memories which cluster about
the dear old spot are solaces in the
weary. weary struggle we make
day by day to build in our new
Eldorado a home to which our
children in future time will turn,
as we turn now to the old place
where our loved ones in the even
ing of life await the inal summons.
