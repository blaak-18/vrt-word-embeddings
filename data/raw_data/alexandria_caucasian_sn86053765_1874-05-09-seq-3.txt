The white people literally adopted
the doctrine of non-resistance, Urbich
has been so strenuously urged as
remedy to alleviate the evils of re

They have quietly submitted to
have their parochial, legislation and
taxation committed to hall'a dozen
negroes aid three or four white
men, suddenly concerted to repub

no one could defend them but the

_ No person can ever adequately
tell the" story, which is told by
these tax notices themselves. We
know nothing in"history that equals
it, except the proposed taxation of
the Netiicrlfrtwis by-Phillip 11. which
drove them into revolt. And it is
thus left for America alone, the
larntof Ihe free,.under the gnise of
Republicanism, to rival the great
e»t despot of modern times, lint
as bad as the story, which the face
of these notices tell, it is still half
untold. On their face they are
about 9 per.-cent, but the legisla
tiire. whose only mission has been
that of plunder, were not to be thus
cheated of their prey. The assess
ments were likewise placed in the
hands of their minions. This land
is assessed at double its value and
the taxes instead of being only 0
per. cent, are about 18 per. cent—
and it is a fair representation of
taxation in Natchitoches and of
what it lias been for.five or six
years. e
That no one will own land under
such taxation is apparent to all. To
call it confiscation, would be to
make confiscation more odious than
it is.Qfor it has at least the punish
ment of crime for its pretext. It
seems to us that when these tax no
tices are sent to thill houses ®>f (he
thousands of that Parish, that they
col we as messengers to mock at their
submission, And tell them ot gaunt
want, tnat shall g.'izo at them from
the eyes of their wiVes and little
ones. To Tell them ot their lost
homes which have been forfeit#] to
administer to the riches and ease
ami to adorn the houses of' their
spoiliators. Is their no relief? Is
thousands ot Natchitoches, when
they shall beg that a homestead
may be spared to shelter them and
their little ones from the storms and
cold of Winter '! Will there be
none, to hear when gaunt famine
shall scot at their henrth-s.oi.ies and
j mock their crifiv for bread f May
God shelter the poor 8011th from
the pityless robber» 1 « of Recoil
strnction, more desolating than the
! ravages of war.

f if a 11 act Kit op General Lee.—
The following tribute to the charac
ter of Robert E. Lee, is paid by tin*
Honorable 13. H. Hill, "in his late
Atlanta Speech. We have rarely,
if ever, read a more beautiful tribute
and rendered more beautiful by its
truth:
When the first historian comesto
survey the character of Lee, he will
find it rising like a huge mountain
above the undulating plain ot im
munity, and he will have to lift his
eyes high towards heaven to catch
its summit. He possessed eve'ry
virtue of the other great command
ers without, their vices. He was a
foe without hate, a friend °4vithout
treachery, a soldier withoutfauelty,
and a victim without murmuring,
lie was ajpHblie officer without, vi
ces, a private citizen without waging
—a Christian without hypocracy—
nnda man wi bout gmile. Ile was
Ca'sar without, his ambition, Fred
erick without his tyranny, Napole
on without his selfishness, and
Washington without his reward.
Me was obedient to authority as a
servant, and royal in authority as a
king. He was gentle as a woman
.in life, modest and pure as a virgin
in thought, watchful as a Roman
vestal on duty,, submissive to law
as Socrates, and grand in battle as
Ach i Ifl's.
Tiie II?)3ie e of Taste.-- How
easy it is to be neat, to be clean !
Mow to arrange the rooms with the
most graceful propriety! How
(Oisy it is to invest onr houses with
the truest elegance! Elegance re
sides not with the upholsterer or
the draper; it exists in the spirit
presidingo over the apartments of
the dwelling. Contentment must
always be most grateful : it shfals
sereni ty over the scene of its abode ;
it transforms a waste into a garthSn.
The home lighted by these imitation
of a nobler and brighter life may bo
wanting in much which the discon
tented desire; but to its inhabitants
if will be a palace, far outvying the
oriental in brilliancy and beauty.

Tho older boy took bis hand in a
kind and fatherly way and said:
"Oh, never mind, Jimmy don't;
fchine) it is a great deal better to
whistle k "
And he began in the merriest
way a cheerful boy whistle.

" " 1 can't whittle as nice as yon,
Charlie," said he; "my lips won't

"Oh, that is because yon have

.said Charlie ; but you try a minute,
and the whistle will drive tîio whine
away."
»So he did, and the last I saw or
heard of the 'little fellows, they
were whistling away as earnestly
as though that was the chief end of
life.
