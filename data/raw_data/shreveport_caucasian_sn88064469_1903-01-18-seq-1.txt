He Turn Up?
Max Stern, a name if not known to
fame,, is registered on the criminal re
cord on several charges for which he
has been indicted by the grand jury. It
will, be recalled -that not long since Max
Stern was arrested for having in his

a number of merchants in this city. At
the time he stated that he had acquired
these goods honestly, in the course of
legitimate -trade, and he was released
on bond. his sureties being Wm. Win
ter $85o: P. Youree $250, Justin Gras
$4oo, Before the grand jury met Max
Stern was in town, in the court house.
but he has disappeared, at least Sheriff
Ward and all his deputies have failed
to locate him or lay hands on him.
Where is Max Stern, thy persecuted
man, who would face justice when called
to trial and prove to the world that he
is an innocent man. He may turn up
and relieve his bondsmen.

ST. PETER AT THE GATE.
(Specially dedicated to hen-pecked hus
bands.)
St. Peter stood at the golden gate
With a solemn mien and an air sedate,
When up to the top of the golden stair
A man and a woman ascended there;
Anplied for admission. They came and
stood
Before St. Peter, so great and good,
In hopes the City of Peace to win
And asked St. Peter to let them in.
The woman was tall and lank and thin.
With a shaggy beardlet on her chin.
The man wars thick and short and stout:
His stomach was built so it rounded out.
His face was pleasant and all the while
He wore a kindly and genial smile.
The choirs in the distance the echoes
woke.
And the man kept still while the wom
an spoke:
"O thou who guardest the gate," said
"Vc two come hither beseeching thee
To let us enter the heavenly land, -
And pkay ;,nr harps with the angel band.
Of m:n, St. Peter, there is no doubt.
'1 here is nothing in heaven to bar me
out.
I've heeni to the meetings three times a
seek.
And almost always Id rise and speak.
"I've told the sinners about the day
When they'll repent of their evil way.
I've told my neighbors-told them all
'Bout Adam and Eve and the primal
fall;
I've showed them what they'd have to
do
If they'd pass in with the chosen few,
I've marked their path of duty clear
Laid out the plan of theilb whole career.
"I've talked and talked to 'em loud and
long.
-For my lungs are good and my voice is
strong;
So. good St. Peter, you'll clearly see
The gate of heaven is open to me,
But my old 'man, I regter to say,
Hadn't walked in exactly the narrow
way;
lie smokes and he swears, and Traie
faults he's got,
Ar.i I don't know whether he'll pass
or not.
aU -.never wadsd 'pray wi itt an:.
Or go to revival or join in- a hynnA
So khad to leave him in sorrow there,.
While I with the chosen united in
prayer;
He ate what the pantry chanced to af'
ford,
While I in nw purity sang to the Lord;
And if cucumbers were all he .got
Its a chance 't he merited thens'or ,ot.
"Bu .oh, St. feter, I love hinm s-1
Wo the pleasure of heaven please let
Ive dotaint y been.
Won't that atone? Can't 0y let him
-By my grim . d - klewi 'tis so
That the unr ie adi stint fry taow.
But isn't there _so way ydu can see
That he' may ;enter when s tear to mue?
it's a narrow l by which I wray,
$1tthe bcots t, t to find some way
or- fits. or bribing you.
that their relations can amble
throt ."
An say, t.Peter, it seems to me
This gte isn t kept as it ought to be.
Yotr otght to stand by the opening there
And not sit down in the easy chair.
At 'say St. Peter, my eyes are dimmed
I do like the, way your whiskers
tre trimmed:
They're cut too wide and outward toss:
Thyd look better Fnarrow. cut straight
aerss. -
Well, we nuit be going4' our crowns to
wi n,
Set oren, St. Peter, and ive'Il pass in."
StPrster tnd troked his statf
Thea said, wth a ls~y gleam in his eve:
'"Who' tending the gatmwv, yout Or i.
And then he ;&atose hins stature tall,
And 1 reased a button upon the wall,.
Andt said tha the idp who answered the
belL:
"Eseort this lady arottd to hell!"
The man stood still asa piece of stone
Stood sadlly, gloomily l tere alone.
tfe-kgsetleuidea ihe had
That I wife wa~ good and he was bad,
He, -ha if :the .wom1au.wetd n

Tmat he: uld certainly have t go-
That if- she went to the reeion dim
There.; was a ghbw. oft a chance for
him.
Stowly he turned by habit bent,.
To foflow 4wherever the womiant went.
St. Peter, standiung on duty there,
Observed hat the top of his head was
bare
lz aik.tke gentleman back and said:
'riend, hw long have you been wed'?"
"'Thisty yeats" Y with a. weary szili)
MAnd t `. s e fiosgitfnlty added' Why?"
Sm Pet wm sibnt. - With bead bent
Sad ut ratched his
"Thirt years with that tonwue so sharp?
Ho! Angel Gabriel! Give him a harp!
A Jeweled barn with a golden string!
Good siri pass in where the angels sing?
Gabriel. gie him a seat alone
One ith a cushion, up near the throne.
Call tip some angels to play their best.
Let hIi enjoy the music and rest.
See that un finest ambrosia he feeds.
Ilie's i'd about all the hell he needs.
It isn't htrdh the thing to do
1 o roast him on earth and in fu
ture. too."
* a* * * s r
They gave him a harp with golden
strings,
A glittering robe and a pair of wings.
And he said as he entered the Realm of
day:
"Well, this meats cucumbers, anyway."
And so the Scriptures had come to pass:
"The last shall be first and the first shall
be last."
