IAN ARTICLE INTENDED FOR
THE FARMERS.

"Willett & Grey's statistical revi-ew
places the consumption of sugar in the
United States at 1,945,406 tons during
the year 1895, against 2,012,729 tons in
1894. This means that the people bought
less sugar by 67,323 tons in 1895 than
in 1894. Yet the price of raw sugar
averaged lower during 1895 than
throughout any other year of which
commercial history takes notice."
The above is from the Inter Ocean,
and is made the basis of an argument
in favor of protection, the idea being
that the cheapness coming from free
trade will not bring prosperity.
Whether the Inter Ocean is right or
wrong upon that point, we shall not
consider. The statement is reproduced
for another purpose. In some cases
cheapness may be a good thing, but
when the cheapness is caused, not by
superabundance of the commodity, but
by a scarcity of money, it is an unmiti
gated evil so far as the masses of the
people are concerned. Under such cir
cumstances, to talk about the "con
sumer's" beneft is the very refinement
of cruelty. The source of all human
prosperity is industry, and the very
basis is that particular industry which
is applied to production. Without "pro
duction' no other business could live,
and nan himself would disappear from
the face of the erth.
Production is the primary work of
man, while everything else is secondary
and subordinate.
The producer is also a consumer, but
if he make anything more than a bare
living he must sell more than he buys.
Take the case of a farmer. Suppose
that of his crop he can sell $1,000 worth
each year, while his expenses, including
grocery bills, help on farm, doctor bills,
taxes, etc., amount to $800. He saves
$200. Now suppose that prices fall one
half all along the line. His crop for
sale sinks to $500, his expenses to $400,
and instead of being $200 ahead, he
only has a balance of $100.
This, though, is upon the supposition
that all things have fallen in the same
ratio. But we know that all things do
not cheapen uniformly. Taxes, for ex
ample, have not been reduced at all.
On the contrary, in many cases. they
have actually increased. Presidents,
governors, congressmen, judges and io- 4
cal oacers continue to draw their sal
aries as of yore, while those who pay
the salaries sell the products of their
labor for half price. Doctor's bills,
lawyer's fees, traveling expenses and
other things remain substantially the I
same.
The hired man stoutly resists (and ,
properly) a cat in his wages, while the
manufacturers, the middlemen, and the
merchants by combinations do every- t
thing in their power to keep up retail ,
rates, The great farm staples are
usually sold at wholesale prices.
Bearing these facts in mind let us n
now make another calculatlon. Sup
pose his tames, doctor bills, etc.,pmount
to $100 0 his. total expense., These
stand as before. Upon the rt maining
$700, which ineludes the hired man's
pay, grdeeries, drugs, etc., we will sup
pose that there is a reduction of say
0 per cent This represents a suving
to him of $210, leaving his expenses on
these lines $410. In the meantie his
$1.00 has fallen to $500. The account
anw stands as follows:
Ineome.--(Crop for sale .. $500.00
peases.-(T-zes, doo
tor's bills, etc. .......$100.00

Thus the wage worker comes in for his
share of the injury.
While the farmer will reduce his con.
sumption of sugar, spices and the like,
poor people dependent upon their daily
toil must reduce on aJ lines. They will
consume less bread.
Accordingly we find that in seasons
of great business depression there is
usually a reduced consumption of al
most everything that contributes to the
sustenance of man.
For example, in 1893, a very disas
trous year in business, we consumed
62.000,000 bushels less wheat than in
1892. In 1894. w'hich. as a whole, was
even worse than in 1893, the consump
tion was nearly 102,000,000 bushels less
than in the latter year.
Thus we see that the alleged overpro
duction so persistently brought for
ward by the gold people as an explana
tion of the falling prices is in fact un
der-consumption. With prices lower
than ever before, the people have
bought less, and consumed less. It has
been simply because they have not had
the money to buy with.
The idea that people can be made
prosperous by making money scarce
is preposterous, and the belief that sil
ver ean be displaced without making a
scarcity of money is equally so.
GOLD AT A PREMIUM.
And Yet Wall Street Has Survived the
Shook.
Gold is at a premium. On Thursday
last it was 1% per cent.
How Wall street survived such a
shock Is one of those mysteries that
will probably never be explained. For
two years past the appalling picture of
"gold at a premium" has been kept in
the very focus of the public gaze. True,
the gold people never specified particu
larly just how we were to be ruined by
it. They left that to the imagination.
Gold has been at a premium over com
modities and other forms of property
for more than twenty years. That,
however, has given the gold worship
per no concern. The fact that the pro
ducer had to labor twice as long or
twice as bard to get a dollar, was a
good thing--for the man who already
had the dollars. But at the idea of
some importer or Wall street specula
tor having to pay one or two per cent
lpremium In order to get gold for export,
he actually stood aghast. But the
dread moment came. Gold went to a
premium of a cent and a quarter, and
except for the telegraphic mention of
the fact we should never have known
the difference. It is now in order for
the gold standardists, whose whole
soul has been wrapped up in the idea
of "parity," "one dollar as good as an
other," etc., etc., to rise and explain.
It will probably be said that the pre
mlaum was small and that it was only
temporary. Well, how great must the
premium be and how long must it last
to hurl us down the awful abyss of
financial ruin. If 1% per cent is not
enough will 2 per cent do the work, or
$ or 4 or how many per cent must it be?
The profits of the syndicate on the first
secret bond deal, represent a premium
of 16 per cent on the gold furnished to
the government Even that, bad as it
was in every respect, did not ruin the
country. It only disgraced it. We
expect to see a premium on gold a good
many times within the next year, and
we expect to see the goldite shift his
position concerning it as often as he
has with reference to the "danger
point" of the treasury reserve. The
reader will remember that for a long
time the line was sharply drawn at one
hundred millions. Then the line was
lowered to ninety millions, then to sev
enty-five and now it seems to be alto
gether indefinite. So will it be with the
premium on gold.
MAY ACT WITH POPULISTS.
Powerful imetale Orgssatsm Would

Referring to the consolidation of the
American Bimetallic League, the Na
tional Bimetallic Union and the Na
tienal Silver Committee, the Weekly
Tribune oet Callaway, Neb., says:
"The new organization resolved to
support the party declaring In its favor;
hut deelares that in the event of non
suapport by either of the great parties,
the Union will put its own ticket In the
next caspaign."
Then that paper waxe indignant ever
the nsupposed fact that the American
Blhetalple Union bhas turned the cold
eheulder as the Popeist party.
The Natloal BlmetaUlist is anx
ious that no misapprehensions may
arise with referene to the attitude of
the ennsolidated orgamimation, and it
wl theletore say to one and all of its
readers, that it has taken no such acten
as that mentieoed habove. It has adopt
ed no such resoluttesm, made no such
!declaration and in fact has thus fa
proposed nothing In the world but a
campaign of ednestion. It hars o dis

E TERNAL VIGILANCE.
FCPU-'IS S WILL DO WELL TO
KELP THEIR EYES OPEN.
The Silver Men Have Not Yet With
drawn fror the Old Partles-The
illmetallic Convention .lay Not Step
reseat the People.
This paper has repeatedly advised the
filver men of the old parties who could
not now see their way clear to join the
people's party, to withdraw from the
gol;"ug parties and form a party of
their own, and expressed the belief
that if they would do so nothing could
keep them and the populists from com
ing to an understanding. We said that
when old party ties were severed they
would not see so much in the populist
platform that was objectionable to
them. When the single plank platform
was first advocated we asserted that
the money question in its broad sense
was alone worthy of a dozen campaigns.
But we opposed the single plank move.
The party was advancing rapidly on
the Omaha platform. The raih'oad and
government loan and postal banks
propositions were dear to many of our
people. These principles of the party
had gathered to us, we had reason to
believe, a large per cent of our strength.
They were concrete and caught the at
tention of people whose attention could
not be attracted by the abstract money
question. They were a great aid to
the party instead of a hindrance, as the
one plank men thought.
While the question was up for dis
cussion the bimetallic party was formed
at Washington City. In its platform
there was none of the alleged objec
tionable planks of the Omaha platform.
We hoped this new party would be
able to gather around its banner mil
lions of voters. But from all appear
ances it proved a complete failure. One
trip across the continent by Mr. Sibley
and little was heard of it afterward.
The silver men-most of them, who
had abandoned the old parties found a
suitable place in the people's party and
this left no room for the bi-metallic
party.
Our national committee by a majority
vote of those present, decided, last
week, at its meeting in St. Louis, to
ask those desiring financial reform but
who are not ready as yet to join the peo
ple's party, to hold a national conven
tion at same time and place as the popu
list convention with the view of getting
together.
Months ago this paper suggested that
the silver men of the old parties form a
party, if they could not come to us,
appoint their county, state and national
committees and call a convention at
same time and place as the populist
convention, and expressed the belief
that the two bodies would agree. It
would seem that we have no room for
complaint at the committee's action.
But the silver men have not withdrawn
from the old parties. They have not
formed state organizations. It is pos
sible that the bli-metallic convention
will have no constituency. That the
delegates will not be appointed by the
people. That the bi-metallic conven
tion will represent a very few people.
That it will simply serve to give the
one plank men a strength much larger
than the one plank sentiment, in case
the two bodies go together, and that
with a part of the populist convention
and all of the bli-metallic, they will be
able to dictate platform and candidatcs.
On the cther hand, there may be a
bolt from the republican convention
and there is pretty sure to be one from
the democratie convention, and it may
turn out that the bl-metallic convention
will represent millions of voters. We
hope so. But let populists bear in mind
that "Eternal vigilance is the price of
liberty."-Missouri World.

Alfalfa In Ohl.
The Ohio station makes .he following
report:
Alfalfa is a plant of the clover fam- i
Ily, and is known as Lucern in Southern
Europe, where it has been in cultivation
from the earliest historic times. It was 1
introduced into Spanish America at an
early date and has become a permanent
and most highly valued feature of the
agriculture of California, Utah, Colo- 4
rado, Arizona and New Mexico.
It is a very deep-rooting plant, which
habit enables it to withstand drouth
well, and thus adapts it to arid regions.
It grows very slowly during the first
season, making irrigation necessary to
establish it in dry climates, and ren
dering it especially liable to be choked
out by weeds or killed by frost during
Its first winter in Ohio.
The Ohio experiment station has
made repeated attempts to cultivate
it, both at Columbus and in Wayne
county, but the difficulty of getting a
stand is so great, and the plant is so
particular about its soil, that we do not
expect its culture ever to become gen
eral in Ohio, although there are some
regions of the State where it would
seem that it ought to thrive.
To those who wish to experiment
with it we offer the following sugges
tione: Select a loose sloil, prefer
ably sandy, lying above a gravelly or
porous subsoil, with, it possible, a sub
terranean water supply. The soil condi
tions which are found in many of our
river bottom lands would seem to be
most favorable.
Avoid a soil on which water stands,
or one having a hardpan near the sur
face. Prepare the land by plowing and
harrowing most thoroughly, as soon as
It can be worked in the spring. Sow the
seed 'which should be American grown)
at the rate of 30 to 30 pounds to the
acre, and cover it with a light harrow.
When the weeds have grown to sum
cient height clip them off with a mow
ing machine, with the cutter bar turned
up so as not to cut close to the ground.
repeating this as the weeds grow dur
ing the season.
No crop is to be expected during the
first season, but it should give two cut
tings the second year, and after that
about three cuttings each year. If a
good stand is secured on suitable soil it
will not need renewing for many years.
The New York State experiment sta
tion at Geneva has succeeded in secur
ing a fine stand of alfalfa, which has
thus far endured the winters, and there
are isolated instances of successful cul
ture on the gravelly loams of South
western Ohio and on the sandy lands of
the lake shore.-Farmers' Review.
Malt Box for Cow,.
Live stock should have a quantity of
salt fed to them regularly. The better
way Is to place a quantity of salt
where it will be accessible to them
at all times, and this is done in no
more satisfactory way than by the use
of a covered salt box similar to the
one shown in the illustration. The box
Ia 14in. long, 91n. wide, 8in. high at the
back and 61in. in front. The box Is firm
ly nailed to the fence board or to a
post or side of a building, as most con
ven'ent. The cover is hinged, and has
a bevel-shaped piece (E) nailed at the
top to prevent splitting, also to cause
the cover to fall back into position.
The front end of the box (A) is cut
away, exposing the salt, and in trying
to get it the cover is raised. Cattle
readily learn to raise the cover when
they are salt hungry. The stake placed
under the box in front holds It firmly
in position, and the whole makes a
cheap and convenient arrangement, as
from a weel's to several weeks' supply
of salt can be placed In the box at once.

Cost of Pork.-An experimenter says
that one bushel of prime corn will make
over ten and a halt pounds of pork, 1
live weight, and from this deduction,
with corn at 25 cents per bushel, pork I
will cut the producer 2% cents per
pound. When corn is worth 34 cents
per bushel, pork will cost the producer
4 cents per pound; 50-cent corn, pork (
5 cents per pound. He further says a
that a pig at Its birth should weigh
about three pounds and increase in
weight month after month as follows:
15, 30, 48, 63, 10, 135, 170, 210, 225,
and on the tenth month should weigh
300 pounds. Also that the cost of a
pound of pork is 50 per cent greater if
made in the tenth month than In the

The Fool and His Money.
Every one has heard about the part
ing of a fool and his money. A case
in point, except that the man was a
woman, recently occurred in a Nebras
ka town. Revival services were in
progress and were attended by the wife
of a wealthy banker. She became con
verted and one night gave her '"experi
ence." She said she had discarded her
diamonds, represented to have been
worth $50,000, because she was con
vinced it was ungodly to wear them.
and that before she started for church .
that night she had placed them all in
the bureau in her bedroom, intending
to let them remain there until she
could dispose of them altogether.
some man left the chnrch as she sat
down, and when she arrived home she
found the house had been broken into
and all the her jewelery was gone.
On the bureau was a note from the
I frglar, who said he was glad to re
move temptation from her path.
His Opinion.
A Chicago man is of opinion that
Adam was a giant, about twenty feet
high, and that Noah was about the
same sise. His theory is that a man
is about one-third of his years of life
in maturing, and men who lived sev
eral hundred years had ample time to
grow. Eve, of course, was a very tall
woman, as Adam had no chance to
choose her, after the manner of other
tall men who secure short wives.
A Novel Suit.
Ezekiel Phillips, a life convict who
was pardoned out of an Illinois peni
tentiary by Gov. Altgeld, is suing the
State for $5400 for services rendered
while in prison. It appears that in
stead of being required to do "hard
labor," according to his sentence, he
was made a gatekeeper, and says that
the Job was worth $30 a month.
