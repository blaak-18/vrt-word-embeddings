TOM WATSON MELON—72-tb. •
The very best and most attractive melon ever
put on the market, it is long and dark green
in color, and its eating quality has no supe
rior, it keeps longer than any other melon after
ripening, and is one of the best shipping mel
ons grown; it will make more money for those
who plant it than any other.
I planted a few acres of very thin land last
season to supply my home trade, and to se
cure more seed for the growing demand, and
to my surprise I not only made all the melons
for this purpose, but sold five car loads that
brought me $450.
Read what Mr. P. B. Sharp, of Oklahoma,
says of them: “I received the package of
seed in due time, and planted them rather late
in season, and hardly cultivated them at all,
but they grew a very fine crop of melons, the
finest that I ever saw in the Simerion Valley
this season, will plant no other next season,
as I consider this all that is desired in a
watermelon.”
I have a few seed from this wonderful melon,
to offer to the growers at $1.35 per pound, five
pounds for $6.50, express prepaid. Address
