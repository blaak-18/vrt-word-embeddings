LETTERS EROW THE PEOPLE
THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD PLAN.
Salem, Va.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.:
My Dear Mr. Watson —Will you
please tell me w*hy this so-called pan
ic holds on. 1 never before saw one
that prices advanced. Is it a move
on the part of capital to crush labor?
What do you think of a plan allowing
counties and cities to deposit their
bonds with the United States govern
ment and issue money thereon, guar
anteed by the United States govern
ment, these bonds to bear 1 per cent
interest, payable to said government
to cover expenses. Why should the
government increase its debt by is
suing bonds'? Not a dollar is added
(thereby, unless some, bank uses them
as a basis of issue. Yet our burden is
increased and the few made richer at
Ithe expense of many. Give us an
on the best plan to create mon
ey and get it in circulation at least
cost to the people.
Very truly yours,
W. H. Tinsley.
STILL GETTING ELECTION RE
TURNS.
Nashville, Tenn.
The Jeffersonian, Thomson, Ga.:
Gentlemen —Enclosed please find
check for sl.lO, for which please en
ter one year’s subscription to Jeffer
sonian Weekly for Dr. W. L. Dis
mukes, 418 Jackson Building, Nash
ville, Tenn., and send me one of your
photo knives, as per your “ad.” I
am a regular subscriber to both of
the Jeffersonians, and voted for the
Hon. Thos. E. Watson In the 21st

said vote was ever given.
Yours respectfully,
Jno. C. Lambeth.

LIKES TO SEE THE HOLES.
Chico Springs, N. Mexico.
Dear Sir: Enclosed find one dollar
post office order for the Jeffersonian
for one year.
Mr. Watson, keep shooting back. I
love to see the holes you make where
you shoot, for you always hit the
mark, if it is Lincoln signing away
the American people’s independence,
or in a national bank charter, or some
little upstart on the mission question
that knows it all, until you tell him
some moie. The trust and the Smart
Alex have not as good sailing as they
have had in the past, but they get
there all the same.
I have been a Baptist since 1861,
but never lined up with the money
power Baptist side of the mission
question.. Speak when you have time.
Yours respectfully,
W. H. Wilson.
THE “INS” AND THE “OUTS.”
Webster, Kansas, May 6, 1909.
Dear Sir: 1 will just drop you a
few lines to let you know that there
is a lonesome middle of the road
Populist out here in Kansas. They
are as scarce almost as hen’s teeth,
but as lang as I live here there will
be one. We had no election in this
state, so we had no ticket, and they
wanted me to vote the Socialist tick
et. I told them that I might be
crazy, but was no fool I saw some
Pops take one of the Bills. Now, 1
looked at the Bills and they said crow.
I have quit eating it. Just wrote your
name in the independent column so
they could see where I stood and let
it go at that. I can’t go the republi
cans of the democrats (1 call them
the “ins” and the ‘outs”).
Bryan is like a jumping jack; you
can’t ‘tell what he will do when the
string is pulled again.
Last June the high water cleaned
out my crops, fences, timber and gar
den. That is why you haven’t heard
more from me and had no campaign
funds sent it. You see, I was not an
Italian, so I had to go and pay bank
rates for money to go on.
1 want to see the old Missouri World
started again. I think about Septem
ber Ist 1 can call on some of these
five dollar men that took it seventeen
years.
Boys, don’t vote the old tickets.
You just cut switches to whip your
selves when you do. Tell them like I
do, that they are getting what they
voted for. But I sure do go after
them with all that hurts in all my pa
pers. Half the time 1 do not get to
read the Weekly Jeffersonian, because
I give it away to some demo-rep.
Well, here .is the best part of this
letter for you —a dollar for the month
ly Jeffersonian. Send to address at
bottom of page. 1 want them to show
to men that said the Pops were dead.
1 told them I honored the dead, if
they were brave like the Pops.

READY TO GO TO WORK FOR
THE CAUSE.
Thayer, Mo.
Mr. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.:
Please find enclosed $1 for which
please send the Jeffersonian.
Yes, I think we ought to call a con
ference of all reform factions or par
ties and try and get together under
a new name, preferably the Jefferson
ian Party. At least 1 think it would
be wise to change the name, as the old
parties and their papers have hurled
such epithets and ridicule at the Peo
ple’s or Populist Party that many
good people that would like to break
away from the old parties if they
could find a party to go to that they
had not become prejudiced against.
To pay the expense of a national
conference, 1 suggest that every one
of your following send you whatever
they are able and willing to contrib
ute to the cause. As we all expect
you to take the lead in this confer
ence business, I think we ought to
put the necessary mloney lin your
hands to do the work without any ex
pense to yourself. Then, after the
national conference, let every state
create a fund for the organization of
the party in the states.
These are only an outline of my
views. I am willing to contribute my
share to help get in working shape
as soon as anything definite is settled
upon. But there is one thing sure,
we can never do anything without
Gtje "Seffersonlan
funds. If we had the money behind
us that the old parties have, we could
have swept this country long ago.
But I am with you in whatever you.
think is the best for the cause,
Jasper Miller.
AS TO ANDERSONVILLE PRISON
PEN.
De;\r Sir: I read Newton’s in
quiry as to prisoners. Refer him to
James Madison Page's book, “True
Story of Andersonville.” Page was
a prisoner there, and his book is a
faithful story of it. I guarded
prisoners there eight months and I
know Page is just to us.
Truly,
Jas. Callaway.
WANTS TO HELP DRESS WEEK
LY UP.
Lincoln, Ala., April 30, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.:
Dear Sir —1 nute with much inter
est your editorial, “Will You Help?
in last week’s Jeffersonian, in regard
to enlarging the Jeffersonian and
dressing the Weekly up in covers.
This strikes me as an excelent idea,
and I believe your friends will lend
an extra effort towards helping you
carry out the plan. To those people
who are not acquainted with your
whitings, I think this would be some
inducement to them to subscribe. A
nice, attractive cover on the Weekly
each week would certainly add to its
appearance, and would be much more
likely to catch the eye of the casual
observer. Os course, your admirers
are going to read everything you
write, in whatever shape it may come,
but there are thousands upon thou
sands of people ‘Who think just about
like you do and who would be life-long
subscribers to the Jeffersonian if only
aware of the glorious gospel that the
Jeffersonians contain. So the idea is
to get them out in nice, attractive
shape, so that they will be on the
same footing as other large publica
tions. Then the average man will be
as likely to ouy the Jeffersonian as he
is to buy some other publication. Af
ter reading -the Jeffersonian awhile,
Hie is more than likely to find that he
can not well do without them. I for
one, intend to read them so long as
1 read anything.
If the Jeffersonians could go into
the homes of every voter in the United
States from now until next election
• lay, 1 believe that the Populists could
■win by the biggest landslide this coun
try has ever known.
You have one plan for increasing
the circulation of your publications
that 1 would like to speak an encour
aging word for, and that is the one of
employing local agents all over the
country. They are doing you a lot
of good by inducing many people to
subscribe who otherwise would never
think of doing so. Then when you
once get a fellow, no matter how in
different he may be to start with, he is
bound to become interested if he
reads your burning editorials.
I haven’t much time to help the
cause, but have already secured
oral more subscribers than I at (h-sl
expected to get' Some that I have in
duced to subscribe were, at first, hos
tile towards your teachings, but are
now completely converted and ate
your enthusiastic
I am a stranger to yoiq of edutsOj
and must ask you to pardon ffly in
trusion upon yout valuable time-.
Youts 'for giving the Jeffersonians
a larger circulation,
Geo. H. Love.
APPROVES OUR STAND ON
MISSIONS.
Baker Hill, Ala., May 4, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Sir: A friend of mine
(and yours also) sent me a copy of
your Magazine, also a copy of your
Jeffersonian paper. Words fhil to
express my delight and pleisuffe ifi
reading them. 1 must shy that you
express my sentiments, both political
artd religious, i sincerely appreciate
the fact that in this dhy of sad de
lusion ahd corruption we have one
man that has the. backbone and moral
courage to meet those questions
which are of the most vital impor
tance, and expose the deception and
corruption associated with them
Especially do I feel interested in re
ligious conditions, remembering the
fact that religion is the basic prin
ciple which shapes present and fu
ture conditions, both political and
social.
Learning that you are going to con
tinue yoiir investigations and exposi
tion of the mission question, I feel
particularly interested and desire the
benefit of the same, so you will find
inclosed $1 money order for which
you will please send me -the papers
containing your writings upon that
subject, either the Magazine or the
Jeffersonian.
It has been announced that you
would deliver an address in Eufaula
during this mouth. I sincerely hope
to meet you there. Our people are
more than anxious for you to come.
Hoping for better 'acquaintance with
yon, I beg to remain,
Your friend most sincerely,
A. L. Ray.
ALL FAIR-MINDED MEN WANT
THE TRUTH.
High Shoals, Ga., May 10, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Sir: I have been a Popu
list since the organization of the
People’s Party in 1892, and am still
in the faith, stronger, if possible, to
day, than ever.
I have 'been a reader of your va
jrtoins publications from the first is
sue of your first paper until now,
;and I have yet to find a single in
stance where you have deviated or
wavered from the true doctoine.
I want to assure you that you have
my profoundest sympathy and help
in the great fight you are making for
the cause of truth and the interests
<of humanity. The odds are greatly
against you, but there is yet faith in
man, and the people are reading as
never before.
