ed the :attentionl of ill lovers of the
New Eunland poet and plilosopher to
this town of historic hapl,enings, where
he lived until his death in April, 1852.
The people of Concord are naturally
greatly interested in the approaching
anniversary, more especially because
here commemorative exercises on a
large scale will be held.
The morning will be given over to
the children, and services will be held
in the various public schools. To chil

dren of a larger growth this part of the
Scelebration will be especially interest
ing, reminding them as it will of the
day in 1873 when the boys and girls of
Concord turned out in force to welcome
the sage on his return from a visit to
Europe. Tile main function. however,
will take place at the First Parish
Meeting HIonse in the afternoon, when
there will be addresses by Professor
Charles Eliot Norton, Senator George
F. Hoar. Colonel Thomas \entworth
Higginson and Professor William
James of Harvard. In the evening
there will be a dinner, with a number
of the old friends of Emerson as guests
of honor.
The arrangements for the affair are
in charge of the Social circle, an organ
ization founded in 1782. of which Em
erson was a member for forty-three
years. The circle has but twenty-five
members, and only in case of a vacan
cy is a new member admitted. A- com
mittee consisting of Samuel Hoar, L.
B. Macdonald, Edward J. Bartlett. Wil
itam LI Eaton and Thomas L. Ellis has
charge of the programme for th~ day.
As a matter of course the hundreds
who will visit the city for the Emerson
centenary wIll wait to pay a visit to
the house in whichfi he did jo much of
his work. The old mansion stands at
the corner of the Lexington turnpike
and the Cambridge road and is now oc
capied by Miss Ellen Emerson, the po
et's eldest, daughter, who has been liv
ing there in retirement since the death
of her father, The house is practically
in the same condition as it was when
he passed away. It stands, some little
distance fromo the road and is half hid
den by a clhimp of pine trees. To the
right of the entrance is the library, in
which Emerson spent a great part of
his life, and. u0stairs is his study, a
esy little.oom.
Another hoost or interest in connec
tion with the poet Is the "Old Manse,"
made famous by Nathaniel Hawthorne.
This was built by the Rev. William
mersonea i 1765 and was Ralph Waldo
Uimerson's home for a number of years.
It was here that he wrote "Nature."
Sleepy Hollow cemetery will also be
a Mecea for centenary visitors, for it is
here that Emeisofsa grave will. be
found, as well as the graves of such
thber ilustrlous people satThoreau, the
Al otts and Nathaniel Hawthorne.
Emerson's resting place is marked by a
huge rose quarts bowlder, to which Is
ahxed a copper tablet Inscribed with
the date and place ot birth of the pht
lelosoer.
Concord has indeed been the home of
notables. A little way up Main street

It will not be questioned that certain
individuals in this State will dominate C
and perpetuate themselves or their suc
cessors in office, if the people are allured t
into fancied security, or, when aroused
and urged to action, neglect or fail to
manifest and to exercise the power they
possess and can wield for the better
ment of the State. It will be conceded
that the people being more or less occu
pied with their affairs, business or agri
cultural, are unlike the office-holders
and have little time and inclination to
scheme politics. The politician, the !

scramble and get the most of it; but if I
it be for principles, then let the de

defined. We assert that the major
ity of Democrats who vote are opposed
to the nomination of a governor or t
other officers by a "cut and dried" con
vention in which the "cut and dried"
candidates are foisted on the people who
may be damned if they do not approve '
the' program, and being opposed to con
ventions will favor the nnminations by
a Democratic piimary election. It may I
also be asserted that the great majority
of Democrats who vote are in favor of
the return of all political power to the I
people which is now vested in the Gov- 1
ernor by appointment, through which f
his power is greater than that -of any
governor of any State of the Union, and f
no Democrat who is opposed to the
present system of appointments and of f
"cut and dried" conventions should de
clare himself' in favor of any gentleman,
candidate for governor and other offices,
who shouldi not announce manfully his
views and attitude on these questions.
No man should be nominated and elect

return of all power to the people.
