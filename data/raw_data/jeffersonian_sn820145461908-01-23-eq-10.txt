BROTHER HOWARD NEVER FAILS US.
Adrian, Ga., January 1, 1908.
Dear Friend: On the first day of the year,
before sunrise, and before breakfast, I write
to send you happy greetings for the new year
in the sum of $2, my renewal for the two
Jeffs. Mark you, I don’t send clearing house
certificates, but the genuine government pro
vender. Please change my mail from Adrian
to Hawkinsville, R. F. D. When I have been
in Pulaski county a short time, I imagine
more Jeffs will visit that section than do now.
Yours as ever,
J. B. HOWARD.
FROM ONE OF SHERMAN’S VETS.
Falls City, Oregon, November 23,1907.
My Dear Sir: Your card at hand this morn
ing, so I will renew at once. I did not in
tend to let my time run out, but you know
we have been tied up with the-banks.
Mr. Watson, it seems now is the time for
us old cranks to get in our work. This has
been a set-back for those fellows who shouted
’•'crank,” and “I told you so.” They are
now getting a dose of their own medicine.
Well, when I tell you that I am one of
Sherman *s old vets, don’t get mad at me, for
I want to be fair with everybody. I am an
old vet in the ranks ever since the days of
Peter Cooper. I stand alone, almost.
T will send you a few names: C. Hopkins.
S. Setherlow, R. Moncherly, Ira Mullen, all of
Falls City.
You will find enclosed the amount for my
renewal, so please send all back numbers.
I ask no commission for anything 1 can do
for the cause. Wishing you much success,
' 1 Jim? Yours as ever,
S. M. DENNIS.

Dear Sir: Enclosed you will find a money
order for $1 for the renewal of my subscrip

•working for your Jeffersonians. I followed
you from the Alliance to the People’s Party,
and have been with you ever since. I have al
ways admired Tom Watson. That admiration
has grown from day to day until it is now
a brotherly love that nothing on earth can af
fect as long as you hold to the principles you
have held to for the last twenty years.
Enclosed you will find order for two dol
lars for renewal of my subscription to the
Jeffersonians. I can not afford to miss a sin
gle number. You can count on me as a sub
scriber to the end. I am 65 years old, went

son and J. B. Gordon.
Yours in the fight for right,
P. S. McRAE.
