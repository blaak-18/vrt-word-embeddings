DON’T SEND ME ONE CENT
when you answer this announcement, as I
am going to distribute at least one-hundred
thousand sets of the Dr. Haux famous
‘‘Perfect Vision” Spectacles to genuine, bona
fide spectacle-wearers, in the next few weeks
—on one easy, simple condition.
I want you to thoroughly try them on your
own eyes, no matter how weak they may be;
read the finest print in your bible with them
on, thread the smallest eyed needle you

you like in your own home as long as you
please.
Then after you have become absolutely and
positively convinced that they are really and
truly the softest, clearest and best-fitting
glasses you have ever had on your eyes and
if they honestly make you see just as well as
you ever did in your younger days, you
can keep the pair forever without a
cent of pay and
JUST DO ME A GOOD TURN

and friends and speak a good word for them
everywhere, at every opportunity.
Won’t you help me introduce the wonder

OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
Among the belated pictures re
ceived since our last issue, was a
carefully drawn portrait by Miss
Mary Jones, of Prescott, Ark., three
pictures from three little girls at Har
lingen, Texas, whose letters we pub
lish; and one from Miss Manteree
Perkins, of Canton, Ga.
A VILLA RICA GIRL.
As I have seen several letters from
boys and girls, and they were so nice,
I thought I would try my luck. Hope
you boys and girls haven’t any trou
bles to tell this time. Father is a
subscriber to the Jeffersonian and
magazine. I like to be at our store
when the mail comes, so I can read
the papers. Father sure likes to read
them. My goodness, how some of you
girls talk about the boys! Some of
them sure are mean, and some of
them are not so mean. There are
several means ones around here. I
am 15 years of age, and will be 16
the 14th of November. I have light
hair and dark complexion, and am the
only girl father has. I clerk for him
at our store. The name of the town
we live in is Leatherwood. Hope to
find my letter in print.—Emma Mat
thews, R. F. D. 3, Villa Rica, Ga.
FROM A PRIZE-WINNER.
I received the fifty post-cards, and
was very much pleased with them.
1 think I will try for another prize
some time. Who has my birthday?
The twenty-second of this month I am
fourteen years old. We all think Mr.
Watson is a great man, especially my
aunt and uncle. lam going to school
now, and am in the eighth grade.
We live away out in the country. Our
postmaster died the other day; he had
no relatives that we knew of. This
certainly is a lonesome place down
here. I have a mother and three sis
ters. I will close, with best wishes
to the Jeffersonian.—Sallie O’Guin,
Rutland, Fla.
THE MONTEREY FLOOD.
Dear Daddy Jim:—We have had a
nice rain. The water that drowned
out Monterey swept over all our land,
except one and one-half acres. It
ruined our fall crop. We are going
to plant again. The overflow irri
gated our land. We take the Youth’s
Companion, the Christian Herald and
the two Jeffersonians. I like to read
and write very much. We study our
lessons at home. I don’t know
whether we will get a school this
year.—Your little friend, Lizzie
Adams, Harlingen, Texas.
GOOD AND BAD.
Dear Daddy Jim: —We had a big
overflow, and I had a nice time bath
ing and riding in the boat. We have
two doves and nine little calves. The
overflow destroyed our crops, but we
are going to plant again. lam a lit
tle girl with blue eyes and long, curly
hair. I have a very good grandma,
and I have a very bad cough. Good
bye.—Lena Adams, Harlingen, Texas.
SEVEN YEARS OLD.
My papa takes the Jeffersonian,
and I like to read Daddy Jim’s page.
Ghe Jeffersonian
I thought I would try for the prize. I
think this looks just like you. (Note
by Daddy Jim: I am very glad it
doesn’t.) I am a little country girl.
I live three miles east of Canton.
I was seven years old last Saturday.
I like to go to school. My teacher’s
name is Miss Nellie Keith. I hope to
be in the third grade soon. My pet
is a baby brother; I mind him for
mama. I think he is so sweet. I
will ring off for this time. If I see
this in print, I may come again.—
Mantaree Perkins, Canton, Ga.
A HOME STUDENT.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here is my pic
ture of you. I don’t think it looks
like you a bit; but it is the best I
can do. The overflow came and ruin
ed our fall crop, but we are going to
plant again. I study at home. I like
to go to school. I am a little girl,
II years old. We live in the country,
and enjoy it very much. —Carrie
Adams, Harlingen, Texas. P. S. I
hope this picture won’t be printed.
CARD OF THANKS.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I received my
beautiful postcards some time ago,
and was delighted with them. I in
tended writing and thanking you long
before, but was in school at that time,
and very busy with my studies.
School is out now. I was in the sev
enth grade. I did not draw your pic
ture, because I’m not much of an
artist, and I was afraid you would
laugh at it. Will probably enter your
next contest, and if I should win, I
will try not to be so negligent.—
Your little friend, Cora Funderburg,
Suwanee, Ga.
A COLORADO BOY.
Aly uncle has subscribed to the Jef
fersonian, and he received his first
copy about two weeks ago. I want to
make the acquaintance of the Post
Card Club. I am a little boy, ten
years old. We live on a farm, and
my uncle raises potatoes for the mar
ket. We ship ten or twelve carloads
of potatoes from here every season.
I like to draw, but I see you have giv
en the prizes for your pictures, so I
will enter the next contest, whenever
you have it.—Ernest Traurig, Alt
geld, Colo.
ANOTHER DADDY JIM.
I am a little boy, 11 years old. I
am in the sixth grade. My dad’s
name is Jim, too. Now I am going
to tell you what I did in my holidays.
One day we all went out in the
woods, and had games, and gathered
flowers; and on the other day the
school went to Atlanta, but I did not
go with them. 1 went out in the
country, and spent the day. On an
other holiday we cleaned off our fam
ily graveyard, and after dinner, came
home. If this escapes the waste bask
et, I will come again.—Jim Barfield,
Hampton, Ga.
Oh, you kid! Get to work, and
earn that ten-dollar prize this month.
It’s easy.

PROBABLY
There is not a reader of The Jeffer
sonian who is suffering from a Kid
ney, Bladder or Uric Acid Ailment
but what would like to get away
from costly, heartbreaking failure,
the grinding misery of it all and And
a remedy which when fixed and
ready to take would cost no large
sum, be entirely harmless, woidd
not taste very bad and withal per
fectly dependable in most cases.
So, Mr. Publisher, I will ask you
to tell every such reader (man or
woman) that if they will at once
send their full and plain address to
me I will without charge of any na
ture be glad to direct them to the
remedy I so successfully used in my
own case and right in my own home.
Respectfully,
