There is plenty of room for the peo.
pie's party.
Free silver is not a panacea for our
financial ills.
Yes, a trust is a private affair; it is
also a menace to society.
No money should be redeemable in
some other kind of money.
Teach the people that money re
deemable in specie is a fraud.
Follow up the free silver agitation
with education on a scientific money.
It seems as though it would be a
confidence game for another four
years.
A gold basis means products below
cost of production and poverty for the
producer.
Some of the fellows who voted for
a dear dollar will find it a hard matter
to get any.
The sound money democracy seems
to be another case of the "Tailors of
Tooley Street."
Those populists who want to remain
in the democratic party ought to be
given their papers.
And now comes the question which
are the prod!gals, the sound money or
the silver democrats?
No kind of money that can be con
trolled by bankers can be relied upon
for a stable currency.
It is to be hoped that McKinley will
not put out a sign in the white house
yard to "keep off the grass."
The most important phase of the
money question is to take -the control
of it out of the hands of the banks.
We will take all the good times the
republicans see fit tor give us and a
little later on we will take free silver
also.
Itf the democrats ever get the popu
list assistance Again they will have
to do some of the "rising above the
party."
Itf confidence does not exhaust itself
In the ftit gigantic strides of its buoy
ant exhuberance it may reach the
farmers.
The plutOcrats now have "confi
dence" that they will have the op
portunity to skin the people for an
other four years.
If prices go up won't that make
cheap dollars? And if they don't go
up how is McKinley's election going
to beneft the country?
Education on the questions of
ulanre, transportation and land must
all go along together. The free all
ver issa is too narrow a'pithk to
stand upon.
A burglar has the same right to put
in the plea of "trights of property" to
protect his tools that a eorporation has
to protect their means of alching from
the people.
One good way to make a start toward
goverment ownership is to insist on
the cluing of the mortgages on the
Paciba roads, and the establishment of
a posMl telegraph system.
All thia talk about war with Spain
is bosh. Spain has more war on her
hands aew than she can haadle and
is in no condition to fght even one
state of this B Plaribus Unom.
With government banks we would
never have a panic. No man ever
lot scared about not having a postal
maney order paid when he held it.
That's the kind of confidence we want.
It is useless to talk about uniting
the people under the democratic ban
ner; The neit effort 'to do so will
prove a more miserable failure than
the recent one. The recerd of the
domocratic party will condema it for.
The great republican landslide re

PROSPERITY...NIT!
ARE GETTING IT-BUT IN THE
NECK AS USUAL.
It Takes Money to Make It--ntil the
Farmers Gets Better Prices There
Can Be No Permanent Prosperity
nto This Coeutry.
The country is soon to enjoy pros
perous times.
The goldbugs say there is to be a
business boom all along the line.
Who is going to create that boom?
Is the question.
Will the goldbugs manufacture a
business boom?
If they do it will be the first one
they ever created.
Are the class of men who have a
cinch on the money going to boom
the times?
It takes the trade of consumers to
create a business revival.
Moneyed men are not going to sow
their dollars broadcast all over the
country. /
That is the Only way a rush of
money in circulation can be secured
at this time.
The masses of the people have no
money to turn into the eha0i8et of
trade.
A boom in the business of the money
loaners and usury grabbers is not an
indieatbi of good times.
`Good times and a revival of trade
can only come by the capacity of con
sumers generally to buy goods and
consume them.
The money gang will not bring
trade to the merchant. The masses of
the people must be able to buy the
merchant's goods to make mercantile
business prosperols.
How do these goidbugs intend to
get money ett ih the hands of the
farmes thnd laboring men? Do they
PtOpose to use their money to increase
the price of production and the wages
of labor?
If the money gang should do this it
will be the first instance of the kind
on record. They will not do it.
Then how is money to get into the
hands of the masses of the people
and out of the hands of the bankers
and money grabbers?
It eat only be pulled out of the
money vaults by means of loans.
Who is able to borrow money et if
they had the security to put up de
manded?
Whtt business can a person now
ehgage in that will justify the bor
rowing of money? There is no profit
in manufacture because the masses of
the people are too poor to consutme
the goods.
There is no profit in the mercantile
business for the same reasons. If the
farmer cannot get an increased price
over the present quotations for prod.
ucts he will be forced to reduce rather
than increase his epDetdithii'.
If the laborltg man cannot get an
advante bt wages he will be forced to
cotinue to live as close as he can
and consume even less than he has
for the past few years because his
expenses increase as his family in
creases.
The manufacturer cannot increase
the wages of labor because the price
on his manufactured goods refuses to
advance, for the simple reason that
there is a limited demand for them,
a result of the inability of the masses
of the people to consume them.
Now, will some goldbug take his
mind off of the yellow metal long
enough to reason on this subject and
solve the problem and tell the people
who is to be instrumental in bringing
about good times under the gold
standard?
The only solution possible is that
good times cannot come and never
did come under a contracting system
of finances and the gold redemption
policy forces a continued contrac
tion of the currency. Not only that
but a gold standard system results in
a continued appreciation of the stand
ard, the redeeming money, which is
gold only, and as that standard appre
ciates wages and products must de
cline in price. It is as natural for
gold to appreciate and for labor ~ad
products to depreciate under a gold
standard system as it is for flowers to
bloom in their season or to wither by
the "north wind's breath."
Then who is to cause the business
boom promised? Whence cometh
this prophetic boom? Wherefore will
there be a boom when the conditions
are forelign to its appearance? Will
some of these "good money people'"
please explain the cause and source
of the business boom promised if Mc
Kinley was elected? An anxious com
monality woulike to lknow.-South

The only good reason which the re
publoans seem to be able to give for
passing the Dingley )evenue bill is to
"make the receipts equal to the ex

of measures making the expenditures
equal the receipts?

NOTES AND COMMENT.
The Same Irrepressible Conflict Is Being
Waged.
The issues involved in the recent
campaign were not unlike those that
were waged with terrific force on
either side in the days of Andrew Jack
son. However much the discussion
has hinged on the silver question, no
intelligent man will deny the fact that
the money question was at the bot
tom and was the real issue in the
recent campaign.
Not only that, but it was a contest
made by the banks for the control of
the currency. A contest between those
who seek to monopolize the money of
the nation and those whose products
and labor are measured. by it. Since
Jackson's time organized wealth has
not only increased in volu,'s but in
political power and influence. Now,
as then, It regards the politician as a
purchasable commodity. But it does
not stop here; it. enters our legisla
tive halls with its paid lobbyists and
spreads the sl!me of its corruption on
the sacradotal robes of the ministry
and debauches the administration of
justice in our courts,
Thb people, too, have increased in
numbers from 15,000,000 to 70,000,000.
During and since the war the money
power, ever busy, has made its greatest
strides and strengthened its intrench
ment in opposition to the rights of the
people. This has been done so quiet
ly, so shrewdly, under the specious
pleas of "patriotism." "honest money,"
"the national credit," etc., that the
people to-day scarcely realize the ex
tent of the danger which threatens
them. Yet this great power which
tiew threatens the life of the repub
lic is twenty times as strong as it was
in Jackson's time, and its ramifica
t:ons permeate every channel of com
merce and reach to every nook and
corner ~f the land.
S " *
The deve~opments of tne recent
campaign should be enough to open
the eyes of those who have hitherto
been closed to the imminent danger
of this huge octopus. The banks, em
boldened by their successes in the
past, have openly threatened to fird
duce a panic and widespread disaster
if their demands were not acceded to
and thb "existing gold standard" main
tained. The letter of Henry Clews,
threatening to invoke "the reserve
power of Wall street," is revolution
ary in its spirit and goes to show that
the banks would plunge the country
into internecine war itf it was neces
sary in order to gain their point.
That letter stands out as a monument
of insolence and threatened lawless
ness that justifies us in raising the
black flag of anarchy over Wall street.
With increased force now come the
wariing tbf AndSew Jackson when the
saii% flght was being iwaged Sixty
years ago. Speaking of the United
States bank in his farewell address
he said:
"The immense capital, the peculiar
privileges bestowed upon it, enabled it
to exercise despotic sway over the
other banks in the entire country.
From its superior strength it could
seriously injure. if not destroy, the
business of any one of them which
might incur its resentment and it
openly claimed for itself the power of
regulating the currency throughout
the United States. In otlher words, it
asserted (and undoubtedly possessed)
the power to make money plenty dr
scarce, at its pleasure, at any time, ald
in any quarter of the Union, by con
trolling the issues of other banks and
permitting an expansion or compell
ing a general contraction of the circu
lating mediufm, according to .its own
will. The other banking institutions
were sensible of its strength, and they
soon generally became its obedient
instruments, ready at all times to exe
cute its mandates; and, with the banks
necessarily went also that numerous
class of persons in our commercial
cities who depended altogether on
bank credits for their solvency and
means of business; who are therefore
obliged, for their own safety, to pro
pitiate the favor of the money power
by distinguished zeal and devotion in
its service."
Continuing he said:
"'The result of the ill-advised legis
lation, which established this great
monopoly, was to concentrate the
whole moneyed power of the Union,
with its boundless means of corrup
tion, and its numerous dependents, un
der the direction and command of one
'aknowledged head; thus organizing
tale particular interest as one body
and securing to it unity and concert
of action throughout the United
States and enabling it to bring for
ward, upon any occasion, its entire
and undivided strength to support or
defeat any measure of the government.
In the hands of this formidable power,
thus perfectly organized, was also
placed unlimited dominion over the
amount of the circulating medium,
giving it the power to regulate the
value of property and the truits of
labor, in every quarter of the Union;
and to bestow prosperity or bring run
upon any city or section of the con-
try, as Might best eompart ith lb
own tarlet er ppUlr,"
Nor does it seem that Jackson had
any confidence in the patriotism of
the bankbrs bf that time, for he adds:
"We are not left to conjecturd liont
the moneyed power thus organized
and with such a weapon in its hands,
would be likely to use it. The distress
and alarm which pervaded and agi
tated the whole country when the
Bank of the United States waged war
upon the people, and in order to com
pel them to submit to its demands,
cannot yet be forgotten. The ruthless
and unsparing temper with which
whole cities and communities were op
pressed, individuals impoverished and
ruined, and a scene of cheerlal pros
perity suddenly changed into one of
gloom and despondency, ought to be
indellibly impressed on the memory of
the people of the United States. If
such was its power in a time of peace
what would it not have been in a sea
son of war with an enemy at your
doors? No nation but the freemen of
the United States could have come out
victorious in such a contest; yet, if you
had not conquered, the government
would have passed from the hands of
the mahny to the hands of the few; and
this organized money power, from its
secret conclave, would have dictated
the choice of your highest officers and
compelled you to make peace or war,
as best suited their own wishes. The
forms ofk your government might for
a time have remained; but its living
spirit would have departed from it."
Nicholas Biddle was then, as J.
Pierrepont Morgan is now, the leading
spirit of the money power. He man
aged to subsid:ze the leading demo
cratic papers from Boston to New Or
leans. Thousands of dollars were
loaned (?) to congressmen on no se
curity whatever. The iading papers,
both whig and democratic, arrayed
themselves on the side of the money
power just as they are doing now. A
congressional investigation showed
that government money was used to
influence democratic papers to take a
stand against Jackson. When Jackson
learned this he instructed his secretary
of the treasury to remove the govern
ment funds from the banks. His sec
retary refusing to do it, he removed
him and appointed one that did. Then
a tirid Storm btirlt over Jackson's
head. He was assailed on every aide.
Many of the leading politicians. among
whom were Clay, Webster and Cal
houn, joined in the war on Jackson.
Benton and others stood nobly by
him. The people rallied around him.
Many of the interesting details of that
historic contest is given in a lecture
recently delivered by Charles H.
Schreiner, a Lincoln elector in 1860.

Speaking of this memorable cam
paign Mr. Schreiner says:
"Nicholas Biddle was president of
the great bank. He was the money
king of that day and generation. He
was not only a banker; he was a
scholar, an author, an orator and a
democrat, and had supported Jackson
at his first election. He lived in a
marble palace on the banks of the
Delaware, fifteen miles above Philadel
phia, and there in that palace of pure
white marble, with great Corinthian
columns, this money king dispensed a
hospitality equal almost to any king
in Europe. Thousands of people
thought h4m a vastly greater man
than Gene al Jackson. I was a boy
then, 14 or,15 years old, working in a
printing once, and I remember all the
papers announced one day that Nich
olas Biddle would pass through our
village. W) had no railroads then.
People traveled in the old stage coach
or on the tanal packet four or five
miles an hour. You will hardly believe
me when I day that people came fifty,
sixty, eighty and one hundred miles
-came on fpot, on horseback, in wag
ons, any w/ty and every way. Came
for what? i Why, to see the great
money kind, Nicholas Biddle, as he
stood on the deck of the boat going
up north to take command of his party
in the fight against Jackson. These
good people wanted to tell their chil
dren that they had seen the great
money king, Nicholas Blddle, 'the man
that crushed General Jackson!'
"Of course Jackson was not yet
crushed, but they were so sure he
would be that to them it was just the
same thing. Well, some time befor9
Biddle's charter expired he took a trip
to Washington to have a talk with his
then friend Jackson about a new char
ter for his bank. The old one would
expire in 1836, and, as Jackson was a
candidate for re-election, he thought
it would be a good thing to tell him
about the vast power and influence of
his bank and its many branches. He
told Jackson that the merchants and
men of affairs through all the states
were, as a rule, largely indebted to his
banks and that through the influence
bf his branch banks he could control
the election of any state in the Union.
Then up rose Andrew Jackson, and
with suppressed emotion, said: 'Mr.
Biddle, if that is true--and I think it
.is-I tell you here and now that if
you control the election of any state
in the Union, that is too much power
for one man to have in a free coun
trf in time of peace. And I will tall
you .torthr, here and now, that i1 you
et a new chartsr from congrsss -or
tbht beak, by the Eternal I will v.ra
Ina dharter.* Thea the ght hbuua
in earnest. Then the great money
king set himself to work to defeat the
re-election of Andrew Jackson."
"1 remember very well," continues
Mr. Schreiier, "a meet:ng of this kind
that was held in Williamsport, Pa.,
near where I was born and lived.
Judge Anthony, then a democratic
member of congress, presided and made
a speech. They passed resolutions
setting forth that it was a libel on An
drew Jackson to say that he would veto
the rechartering of the great bank or
that he would remove the deposits.
These good people thought they could
head off General Jackson in this way.
But, thanks to God, Andrew Jackson
was made of sternler stuff. A great
anti-Jackson, an "honest democratic"
meeting of this kind was held in Phil
adelphia, where the great bank was t
located, at which they gave a free din- t
ner to 3,000 men-all paid for by the
great bank Benton, in his great t
work, 'Thirty Years in the Senate,'
gives an account of this great meeting.
John Sargent, with 800 democratic
vice-presidents, presided. All thet
speakers, speaking from twenty t
t:ands, were anti-Jackson democrats
-men who had voted for Jackson at
his first election, but now opposed him
because he had turned traitor and was
trampling on the constitution and the
liberties of the people. They appoint
ed a committee of 300 democrats to go
to Washington and ask Jacl:son to de
sist from his course in ruining the
country. When th!s committee got to
Washington one of these pride-swollen
bankers so far forgot himself as to
say to the president that if he per
sisted in his course the people would
rise en masse and come to Washington
with shotguns, pitchforks, and any
thing that would kill 'to expel the
Gotha from Rome.' Jackson replied:
'Do yeu tome here to threaten me? If
you men dare to put any of your big
threats into execution, by the great
Eternal I will hang you as high as Ha
man.' "
"T remember very well the long col
umns of names that were printed in
all the papers-mostly the names of
great bankers who had left the party
and each one went out with a great
flourish of trumpets as though he
owned the party. It is wonderful
what an amount of noise a few men
can make, with plenty of money and
plenty of great papers to back them!
For a time it did look blue for Old
Hickory. It seemed as if he was being
forsaken by all his old friends. But
after awhile it began to be seen that
for each great banker that left him
four or fe e honest farmers, mechan
ices and laborers came to him. Ah,
Mr. President, in those days the dem
ocratic party was democratic. No,
sir; the democratic party then was the
laboring man's friend. Well, what
was the final result? When the elec
tion was over and the vote counted,
Andrew Jackson, the hero of the peo
ple, had swept the whole country by
storm! IHe'ad more majority than the
other candidates had votes. Then
democrats tejglced with an exceeding
great joy. Bonfires were kindled on
the hills, church belle were rung and
towns, villages and cities were illumi
nated. And amid the general Joy
the Jackson men sang a song of Vic
tory. How well I remember those
glorious days' Sixty years have
rolled around since, but I can hear
that song yet:
"'Freemen, cheer the hickory tree!
In storms its boughs have sheltered
thee.
O'er freemen's land its branches
wave
It was planted on the lion's grave.'
"Yes, Andrew Jackson was indeed a
great man, and his name will live
forever with the republic. He crushed
the great money power of his day and
generation as a strong man crushes an
eggshell in his hand."

The Missouri World is one of the

papers. It favors continuing the ed
ucational campaign. In a recent issue
the World says:
"All the principles of populism
must be framed into law, and there
fore the educational work necessary
to secure such action must go for
Sward. The voters must be taught that
law creates money, that paper money
is the beacon light of an advanced re
demption money is a frand and a de
lusion; that the transportation ques
tion is one of vital interest and the
railroads should be operated as is the
postal system-by and in the interest
of the people. Then, there is the land

BANKERS'CONSPIRACY
THE PROGRAM IS TO DESTROY
THE GREENBACKS.
What Prominent Bankers Have to Say
on the Subject-A Cold Blooded Plan
to Reduce the Per Capita of the Cur
rency.
(Chlcago Express.)
Now that the election is over the con.
sviracy of the money power becomes
more and more apparent and is an
nunced with as much freedom as ever
a victorious army announced them
selves as victors with intent to despoil
the vanquished foe.
The determination to utterly destroy
the greenback currency and place the
total dependence of the country for a
c.rculating medium in the hands of na
tional bankers is too evident to admit
of further doubt.
In response to the question: "What
should congress do to improve the na
tional monetary system?" there seems
to bp a unanimity of opin:on that shows
plainly that the whole plan is pre-ar
ranged and fully understood.
John J. Mitchell, president of the 11
linois Trust and. Savings Bank, said:
"My opinion briefly is this: Congress
should retire all the greenbacks and
silver certifiates and, to prevent a con
traction of the currency, issue long
term 2 per cent gold bonds, allowing
the banks to issue curreny against
them at par. This would do away
with the reserve fund aad take the
government out of the banking busi
ness entirely."
E. S. Lacey, president of the Bank
ers' National Bank, and ex-comptrot
'er of the currency, says:
"In my opinion congress should fund
'he greenbacks and treasury notes into
tong-term low-rate bonds, increase the
issue of circu!ating notes to national
banks to par of the market price of
)onds deposited to secure the same, re
duce the tax on bank note issues to
one-four of one per cent, increase the
redemption fund maintained by the
banks to 10 per cent, provide for the
laily redemption of these notes at the
offices of the United States treasury
in New York, Chicago, and St. Louis,
and increase the customs duties to an
amount sufficient to meet the disburse
ments of the general government, levy
ing the same upon the protective prin
ciple moderately applied.
"The retirement of government notes
should be limited each month to an
amount equal to the volume of new
bank notes issued, so that no contrac
tion in the volume of circulating me
dium would result."
There now you have a complete out
line of the scheme. Let the banks is
sue the money, guaranteed by the gov
ernment of course, to the market price
of the bonds. Let speculators make the
figures, run bonds to any rate of prem
ium, and then let the banks issue their
currency to the full amount, but of
course reduce the tax from the present
figure of 1 per cent to one-fourth of 1
per cent on the issue. But here comes
Mr. Forgan with his suggestion:
"I have had thirteen years' experi
ence in the Bank of Canada," he says,
"and about the same term in this coun
try, and I certainly cannot determine
which would be better for the United
States, a development of the present
system or a radical change based on
the system of the Bank of Canada, of
which the Baltimore plan is a develop
ment."
John R. Walsh, president of the Chi
cago National, said to be the heaviest
in the city, said:
"Congress should provide for retir
ing all government paper currency by
issuing 2H per cent fifty-year gold
bonds that could be used as a basis for
national bank circulation at 90 per cent
of their face value, which circulation
should be issued as fast as the govern
ment paper currency was retired. This
done, all the silver bullion and silver
dollars in the treasury should be sold
at the market price of silver, at the
same time repealing the law that pro
vides for making silver dollars legal
tender. If all bank notes below $10
were withdrawn, I believe the country
could use at least $250,000,000 of silver
as subsidiary coin. After this opera
tion was completed we would have
three kinds of money: Gold, which
would be the only legal tender; natioan
al bank notes and subsidiary silver,"
These are merely samples of the
many answers given. All are in the
same strain and go to prove that the
bank question was the real question
at issue in the last campaign, but the
people couldn't see it and will prob
ably not understand it till too late to
avert national disaster, and the fasten
ing on the people of a financial system
that can never be thrown off except by
revolution.
The indications now are that gold
will become so plentiful that the plu
tocrats will want it demonetized
within twenty years.
The business of the banker is to use
other people's money without secUrlty.

owes,

form. He evidently wnt, to get e ig'
