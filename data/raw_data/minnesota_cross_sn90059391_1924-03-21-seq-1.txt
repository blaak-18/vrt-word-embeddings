FARMER-LABORITIES BOOST
LA FOLLETTE FOR PRESIDENT
Four Hundred Delegates Attend Convention of Minne
sota Third Party at St. Paul —Talk of “Splits” in Ranks
Proves to Be But Idle Chatter.
Platform For Public Ownership, Identical With That Adopted by
Federation in Minneapolis, Is Approved by State Organization—
Have Not Failed Farmers.
(By TWILIGHT)
ST. CLOUD, MINN'., March 15.— The many "splits” in the ranks
of the Farmer-Laborites were revealed today as being largely imag
inary. The convention worked with complete harmony prevailing.
If any threatening internal discord exists in the Farmer-Labor
party of Minnesota, it certainly did not come to the surface on the
convention floor or in the lobbies of the hotels of this city.
Four hundred delegates were pres
ent at the convention when Fred A.
Pike present state chairman, called
for order. The convention was held
in the St. Cloud armory. Banners
bearing the legend “La Follette for
President” decorated the walls ot
hall on every side.
Mr. Pikes opening address was an
appeal for harmony. He said, “Let
us go forward with united hearts,
and shoulder to shoulder, win the
battle that all the states are looking
to Minnesota to win next fall."
The resolution calling for indorse
ment of the national third party
movement was offered by Frank Fish
er and C. A. Hathaway of the St.
Paul delegation.
It stated that “the two old parties
both have been shown by the in
vestigation of the Teapot Dome, vet
erans* bureau, and other scandals
that they are completely in the
hands of big business and against
the interests of the working class,
thus making it necessary for the
farmers and workers to organize a
Farmer-Labor party nationally, as
well as in Minnesota*
The resolution was passed by a big
standing vote.
La Follette Cheered
When Mr. Pike eulogized “fighting
Boh” La Follette of Wisconsin, wild
demonstrations registered approval.
He was mentioned as the logical can
didate for president on a third
party ticket.
After a floor battle lasting ap
proximately an hour, David H. Evans
of Tracy was elected temporary
chairman. There were five others
nominated for the job but they with
drew before Evans was elected.
After the third party movement
had been approved by the conven
tion, David Shier of Minneapolis, one
of the Hennipin county delegates,
raised the question about the con
ference for pclitical action in Cleve
land, July 4, and its bearing upon
the .third party movement initiated
in St. Paul.
Mr. Mahonev answered that it is
the desire of political leaders in the
Farmer-Labor movement to give the
public assurance that there would he

SILENT ABOUT KLAN
Senator Underwood Talks to
South Carolina Legislature
COLUMBIA. S. C., March 17.
Senator Oscar W. Underwood, of Ala
bama, candidate for the Democratic
nomination for the presidency, ad
dressed a joint session of the two
houses of the general assembly la*t
Wednesday. He was heard by about
two-thirds cf the membership and
was given a respectful hearing, but
oid not arouse a great deal of en
thusiasm. He presented his views of
national political issues, but made
no mention of the Ku Klux Klan. He
has been quoted in the daily papers
as being very much opposed to the
organization.
Lull Follows in Cases
of Indicted Rioters
PITTSBURGH, PA., March 13.
The proverbial lull after a storm
seems applicable to the situation in
western Pennsylvania now regarding
the indictment of 11 persons by Al
legheny county grand jury in con
nection with the fatal attack upon
parading Klansmen in Carnegie last
fall, during which Klansman Thomas
R. Abbott of Atlasburg, was shot to
death.
Between the time that the men in
volved in the cases were held for the
grand jury by Justice Prosser, and
their hearing before the grand jury,
a veritable deluge of comment, pre
diction and counteraction emenated
from the friends and relatives of the
men. Now that the men have been
indicted on various charges of mur
der. inciting riot and rioting, their
backers seem to be cognisant of
fact that they attempted to stop
one parade “too many.”

DEMOCRAT WANTS VOTE
OF FARMER-LABORITES
Iklward Indrehus Would Take
Place of Harold Knutson
in Congress
Edward Indrehus of Foley. Demo
cratic candidate for governor in the
19?2 election, Friday announced him
self a Farmer-Labor candidate for
congress in the sixth district. He
said he had received many assur
ances of support from Farmer-Labor
delegates.
‘The Democratic party has ceased
to function in Minnesota,” said Mr.
Indrehus. “I shall file on the Farmer-
Labor ticket.” He is a farmer but,
until now, has held aloof from the
third party and was an opponent of
Magnus Johnson in the last general
election. The sixth district is now
represented by Harold Knutson.
Another party shift was disclosed
with the report that W. L. Carss of
Proctor, will file for the Farmer-
Labor nomination for congress in
the eighth district to succeed Oscar
J. Lar-on. Mr. Carss was elected i r i
1918 as an independent, but filed in
1920 as a Democrat and again in
1922, losing both times to Mr. Lar
son. He sat in the Farmer-Labor
federation meeting at Minneapolis
Thursday as a delegate.
Mayor Julius J. Reiter, of Roches
ter, another former Democrat, will
be a candidate for congress in the
first district, he told delegates to
day. He will file a? a Farmer-Labor
candidate. Mower county members
of the party are backing County At
torney Baudler.
Republicans of the first district
will stage a contest for the nomina
tion, now that Sydney Andtrson has
announced his retirement. Senator
Allen J. Furlow of Rochester, an
nounced himself a candidate Thurs
day. He is a service man and took
a leading part in the last session of

World is Getting Better
Says University Teacher
MINNEAPOLIS, March 14—Oppo
sition by Dr. W. D. Riley and other
Minneapolis fundamentalists packed
the West high school auditorium
last night for the talk by Prof. E. A.
Ross.
Where 300 had been the maximum
expected attendance, 1,000 crowded
in to hear the University of Wiscon
sin sociologist, author and lecturer
discuss the question, “Is the W’orld
Growing Better or Worse?”
He sounded an optimistic note
throughout, but said several import
ant problems, such as war, are yet
to he solved. He stressed improving
conditions of health, public and pri
vate morality, education and govern
ment.
Infantile Mortality
‘ If the babies were consulted,” he
said, “they would vote overwhelm
ingly that the world is growing bet
ter.
“In the sixteenth century the ex
pectation of life of a child born even
in the comparatively cultured city
of Genova was 20 years. Now in the
United States one-half of those born
may expect to live more* than 66
years.”
Prof. Ross considered also the
growing generosity of public provi
sions for secondary education. “When
I was a boy,” he said, “people atill
asked why they should be taxed to
educate other people’s children. Pub
lic sentiment nas so developed that
I haven’t heard that protest of stin
giness for 40 years.
Attendance Doubled
“Attendance in public high schools
has doubled every eight years since
1890. I believe that within 30 years
it will be considered a matter of
course that every child of normal en
dowment will somehow be able to go
through high school'
Prof. Ross dwelt on the institution
of marriage in this e«untry, compar-
ed with other countries. He told of
the close supervision of unmarried
youth of both sexes in eastern coun
tries, contrasting with their freedom
in America. He stressed the sanctity
of American idea that marriage
should be for love.
“In Europe,” he said, “marriage is
arranged with the idea of the bride’s
‘dough’ on the bridgegroom’s mind.
Here, a person marrying for money
is looked dow'n upon.
“There is less divorces in European
countries because people there arc
less scrupulous as to morals, and do
not hesitate to carry on clandestine
love affairs. In America, people pre

WANTS OLD CULTURE
United States Has No Real Sys
tem of lo<llira tion. B.y*
Doctor
SAN DIEGO, CAUF., March 17.
Dr. Tully C. Knoles. president of tho
College of the Pacific, at San Jeee,
in addressing a group of teachers
here, declared that while the United
States has the most magnificent sys
tem of schools in the world It has no
real system of education.
“We have not defined our objective
in education,” he explained, “but it
is necessary that we do so in order
to enable people to see that the
greatest thing In the world is ser
vice for common humanity.'*
He called attention to the fact
that the trend in the schools of to
day is toward social science, and
that the old cultural subjects of
Greek and Latin, so long considered
the foundation of higher education,
are gradually declining.
Burial of Kansas
Klansmen Marked
By Fine Ceremony
LECOMPTON, KAN., March 17-
After the funeral services for Klan?-
man I'or.ald Taylor, 19. who was kill
ed by an electric wire of the Law
rence power plant, were conducted in
the Methodist church here recently
by the Rev. H. A. Babbit, knights
from the adjoining Klans paid tri
bute to their deceased brother by a
brief ceremony at the grave in Oak
Hill cemetery at Lawrence.
Following the service at the church
a long procession, which was met on
the outskirts of Lawrence by mount
ed knights, went to the grave, where
the Rev. Mr. Babbit conducted a
brief ceremony.
After sixty Lecompton Klansmen
heard a brief talk by their exalted
eye lope, they dropped the roses or
tne casket. A fiery cross of red
carnations was added to the great
bank of floral offerings. The services
ended with a prayer by the Klan of
the Locompton unit.

Condemn Mob Rule and Lyneb
lawlessness Now in the
United States
(By TWILIGHT)
The North Star State delega
tion to the Republican naitonal
convention., June 10, at Cleve
land, Ohio, goes instrvcted for
President Coolidge and pledged
to support the soldiers’ bonus
and the McNary-Haugen bill.
Seven delegates-at-large were
elected by acclamation.
Col. Charles E. March, mana
ger of the Coolidge campaign in
Minnesota, was unanimously
elected delegate-at-large. Some
political dopesters point to his
election as an indication that all
discord in the ranks of the Min
nesota G. O. P. has been ironed
out. On the convention floor
there was prevaliing at all times
an unusual harmony, and the af
tefmath of peace seemed to
prove the contention of the
dopesters.
March the Dominates
There was only one outbreak in the
harmonic chorus of the contention,
ai*d that came whw J..H. Jacobson,
late in the tftermTM fasrlbn propos
ed from the floor a resol ition in
structing the delegates of Minnesota
to vote for March for committeeman.
Col March arose and declined the
committee post before Chairman A.
J. Rochne could place the motion.
Jacobson, however, persisted in his
motion, but w?«t almost shouted
down by the convention. After sev
eral had expressed their opinion in
regard to the Jacobson motion,
Chairman Rochne interrupted furth
er deliberation and acted against
the Jacobson motion ihiu WB6 very
nearly unanimously sustained by the
convention. A considerable number
of the delegates at the convention
wished to turn the state convention
into an indorsing convention to re
commend candidates for stale offices,
or at least arr.inge for a subsequent
convention with that purpose, but
nobody put the matter up to the con
vention and it went by the boards.
