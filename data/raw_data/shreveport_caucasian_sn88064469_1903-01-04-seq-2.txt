Colonel Ketchum, at the head of
twel e cowboys, well-armed and mount

storm. At mianight they rode forward
down the section lines, setting stakes
as they came to the corners. As the
first stakes were being driven they
were greeted by a volley of gunshots
from opposing locators, but the bul
lets all went wide of their mark.
Swinging to their saddles the party

for filing. Then, retracing their way
the found that the opposing parties
had, in many cases, pulled their stakes
and burned then in the fire. These

the space with gorgeous hues. The
crowd on the plain was composed
largely of the common people, but
among it could he seen the retainers
of the various rajahs. who had as
sembled for the function.
The attention of all was fixed upon
the white amphitheatre in the center
of the plain where the announcement
was to he made. The amphitheatre
was adorned with gilded cupolas and
surrounded by batteries, squadrons
and battalions of the Indian army. Be
youd the amphitheatre, in the dis
tance could he seen great numbers of
elephants. camels and horses. So
vast was the multitude that the
troops appeared as mere splashes of
color.
Thle arrival at the amphitheatre of
the viceroy of India. Lord Curzon of
Kesleston. and other dignitaries and
the ptrinces was one of the brilliant
episodes of the day. The princes were
clad in silts and adorned with jewels
anti their horses and carriages were
brilliant with trappings of gold.
The spectacle within the arena was
most striking and gorgeous. The Pa
than chiefs and the Sirdars were re
splendent in brilliant raiment. Sol
diers, civilians and visitors from far
distant countries were included among
those within the amphitheatre. Upon
the entrance of the veterans of the
Indian mutiny there was tremendous
enthusiasm and as the arrivals
marched to their places the bands
played national airs. The carriage of
the Duke of Connaught., who repre
sents King Edward, was escorted by
a detachment of cavalry; as the duke
and the duchess were driven arqund
the arena the assemblage gave them
an enthusiastic welcome. Amid the
acclamations of the people the duke
took his seat at the left of the throne,
while the duchess proceeded to a
place behind the throne.
When the great amphitheatre was
filled and the h.ttr -for the announce
ment drew neai the multitude within
and without awaited e-:pectantly the
first act of the proclamation cere
mony.
Then the approach of the viceroy
was heralded. Preceded by members
of his bodyguard clad in white, blue
and gold and under the command of
Major Grimston, Lord Curzon appear
ed at the entrance of the army in his
carriage. The postillions wore uni
forms of scarlet and gold and the
carriage was drawn by four bay
horses. The viceroy was escorted by
Sir Pertab Fingh. Alighting from his
carriage Lord Curzon mounted the
dais to the throne, which i-as decor
ated with golden lions and around
which were placed massive silver foot
stools. The throne itself was sur
mounted by a canopy of white and
gold. When the viceroy reached the
throne the national anthem was play
ed and a salute of twenty-one guns
was fired. When the spectators haO
resumed their seats after the anthem
there was a flourish of trumpets from
the heralds and Major Maxwell, at the.
command of the viceroy read the
proclamation opening the durbar. The
royal standard was then raised on
high and the imperial salute was
fired. The massed bands marched by
playing, bonfires were started by the
troops outside and it was announced
that -King Edward was emporor of In
dia.
There was another flourish of trum
pets and Lord Curzon arose and stood
for a moment impassive. Then in
impressive tones he started a speech
and read the message from King Ed
ward. In his address the viceroy an
nounced the coronation of the king:
he extolled the loyal Indian people
and prophesied prosperity for the In
dianempire. He said also that it har
been decided not to exact interest for
three years on all loans made or
guaranteed by the government of In
dia to the native states in connection
with the recent famine. The viceroy
announced also the abolition of the
Indian staff corps. which has long
been an army sinecure.
In the king's message, which was
then r-ad by Lord Curzon. his majes

Speaking of Germany's hostile dem

other day:
"Germany 's excthse that the Venezue
Ian vessels she sunk were old and un
seaworthy reminds me of the excuse
given by the son of a neighbor of mine
for killing a colt. The animal was
slightly deformed about the head, but
otherwise was healthy and gave pros
pect of ma king a useful horse. One
day the old gentleman came home and
found his colt lying in the farmyard
with his throat (at. On inquiring who
had killed it his son Jephtha declared,
'Why. I did, father.'
"'What did you do that for?' angrily
dema tled his father.
" 'Why. the brute was deformed and
of no use.' answered the young man in
justifeiation of his deed. Germany has
taken the property of Venezuela and
de-troyed it because it was 'deformed
and of no use.' "
