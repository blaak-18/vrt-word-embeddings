Chambers's Incyclopadia.
15 Vols. Over 13,000 Pages. Price D)uring July $6,25.
Amonug the wonderfiul things whieh have been ucomplished for lovers of good
Iooks by the "Literary Revolution," perhaps the most wonderful is the reproduction
of this great Enclycoptdia at a merely nominal onet.
It is a verbatim reprint of the last English edlition, in 15 beautiful volumes, clear
nonpareil type, handsomely bound in cloth. for $7.50; the sne prinated on fner,
heavier paper, wide margins, and bound in half Russian, gilt top, prite $S,. The
tlint ten volumes are rea dy fr delivery. Vol. 11 will ie ready July 10. The re
nmaiuing . laumes will be completed by October next.
$6,25. An Amazing Offer. $6.e5.
The more widely and rapidly these volumes are scattered, the peater is their ln
fluence in inducing other parsbasers of this and our many standard publtletions.
Aesorningly we give special terms to early subseribers.
To all, wheoe orders and money are received during the month of July we will
supply the 15 volumes, in cloth, for $6.25, and in half Russia, gilt top, tfr l.0.
To eauy one sending from any place, where we have no special agent (usally the
leading bookseller of the town), a club of live orders, we will allow a co ion
of 10 per cent. The volnmis issued will be sent at once by express, and .the remali
inug volumes when completed.
A specimen volume in cloth will be sent, postpaid, for 50 cents, or in half Russia,
gilt top, for $1.00, and may be returned at onee,lf not satisfactory.
The "Chambers's Enelvlop" eomprise the first 15 volumes of our 'Library of
Universal Knowledge," and the remainng voliumes, complete In themselves, will be.
sold separately when published.
