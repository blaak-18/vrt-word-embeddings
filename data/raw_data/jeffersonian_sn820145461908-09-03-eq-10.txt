ZSTTZfIJ' T'ROM THE PEOPLE
BRYAN SAID HE WAS IN IT FOR
THE MONEY.
Ataka, Oklahoma', August 20, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson,
Thomson, Ga.
Dear sir:—lf you want to make a
Bryan man red in the; face and then
“cuss” the Populists, just read him
the following letter, written by Bry
an to' Hon. Sterling J. Morton, of Ne
braska, before his last nomination,
and then ask if Bryan is not parad
ing himself all over the country for
the money that is in it.
This letter was brought to light by
the repeated declarations of Bryan
that “the man should be placed
above the dollar.” The repetition of
such phrases having become wearing
upon Mr. Morton, he took occasion to
remark that Mr. Bryan had said he
“desired office not for the honor it
conferred, but for the money that
was in it.” The friends of Mr. Bry
an could not let such ta discreditable
statement go uncontradicted, and 1
they lost no time in calling Mr. Bry
an’s attention to it. He promptly
branded it as a falsehood. Thereup
on, Mr. Morton, his reputation land
veracity being attacked, comes for
ward with his evidence. He gives a
sac-simile of the following letter in
Mr. Bryan’s own hand-writing:
Lincoln, Neb., Jan. 11, 1908.
Hon. J. Sterling Morton,
Nebraska City, Neb.
Dear friend:—Your kind letter to
Mr. Lease was received. I think it
well received. The postscript was ju
dicious, I think. I am grateful to
you for your endorsement. Had hes
itated to write you because I dislike
soliciting aid. I assure that it is the
money that is in the office 'and not
the honor that attracts me. If suc
cessful in getting it, it will tide me
over my beginning here.
With regards to the ladies, I am,
Yours truly,
W. J. Bryan.
Mr. Watson, I hope you will pub
lish this. Let’s let the farmers and
laborers know what things Bryan has
done.
I will write again soon.
I am for Watson and Williams.
('Signed) P. L. Dunaway.
P. <S. If this letter is denied by
any one, I will send you the letter
which I copied it from. My father
filed it away in 1899. I have it, and
this is an exact copy of it.
P. D.
W. A. Sterrett, Strip, Tex.:
“T am anxious to get the Jeffer
sonian before the people, and will do
all I can for you. ’ ’
A. A. Coggin, Brooks, Ga.:
“You will get more votes in this
section than any other of the can
didates. Bryan is all off and we can
not vote for Taft.”
J. R. Pound, Ocoee, Fla.:
“Lots of men here want the Jef
fersonians.”
Andrew V. Hogan, Cristobal, Isthmus
of Panama:
“I read all of your editorials in
Tom Watson’s Magazine when it was
published in New York City, but lost
trace of you till now. Please enter
my subscription again.”
W. B. Screws, Editor of “Flag of
Light,” Stillmore, Ga.:
“I am a Populist and of course I
am anxious for Tom Watson to be
President. He will get my vote if
he gets no more.”
S. G. Childs, Timpson, Tex.:
“My prayers will go up for you
that the people be converted to the
truth. May your efforts for the right
be not in vain.”
J. F. Humphries, Cornelia, Ga.:
“I want a copy of your speech of
July 9. I have voted for you in the
past and I am going to vote for you
this fall, if I am permitted to live
till then.”
William Plunkett, Roswell, New Mex
ico:
“Since Ridpath edited the ‘Are
na’ in Boston, which paper I be
lieve was suppressed something like
your New’ York Magazine was, for
telling the truth, I have not seen a
magazine except the Jeffersonian that
would discuss the money question and
tell the truth about it.
“May God bless you with good
health and long life so you can con
tinue your noble work.”
H. E. Brock, Brockton, Ala.:
“I am an old Pop and I would not
do without the Jeffersonians.”
V. F. Alkire, Keyser, W. Va.:
“Such literature as the Jefferson
ian is just what the voters of our
country should read. I am a Dem
ocrat and the son of a ‘rebel’ mother,
a Free Trader, but I can vote for
you and not sear my conscience in
the least. I consider you a good
Democrat, and if you are elected will
feel that no one else will be Presi
dent during your term of office.”
I
B. H. Brown, Flowery Branch, Ga.:
“Believing ours to be a righteous
cause and all honor to you, our no
ble leaders at the head of the col
umn. Let us press onward to the
final victory.”
Mr. Bryan is proud of his record,
says a Democratic exchange. His

WHAT TROOPS KILLED STONE
WALL JACKSON?
Mobile, Ala., Aug. 21, 1908.
Hon. T. E. Watson.
My dear Friend: In your maga
zine for August you stated in the
book “Bethany,” you unintentional
ly gave pain to the widow and child
ren of General Pinder. You are
right, I guess; I was in all that bat
tle; was in one hundred yards of
Jackson when he was shot. I be
longed to Lane’s, N. C., brigade,
Jackson’s own corps, and was with
him all day, Had run the Yanks sev-
Bfcc Jeffersonian
eral miles. Just about 1,100 yards
from the old tavern or hotel,, Lane’s
men filed to the left of the plank
road; Wright’s Georgia brigade filed
to the right of the road and about 100
yards behind us Lane’s troops, same
brigade, filed to the left of the road
and that line is the one that did the
firing.
J. iS. Hughes of the 33rd North
Carolina troops, Lane’s brigade, was
sent back by Col. R. V. Cowen to
tell the men that they were firing in
to their own men. I know that
Lane’s men did not do the firing, as I
saw r Jackson as he went ahead. This
was Saturday, about 6 p. m., and not
lat midnight, as Mrs. M. J. Preston
states. Sunday morning Lane’s men
were sent to the right or east side
of the road. Wright’s Georgia bri
gade and Lane ’s made the charge and
were cut up badly, but we took the
hill and gulls.
Now, Brother Watson, I love to
read your war stories. I am a Tar
Heel and a Pop for all time to come.
If I could write, I could tell much
of the war that has never been pub
lished and a lot that is published is
not true. The North Carolina troops,
Jackson’s own corps, and Wright’s
Georgia brigade were a part of his
corps in nearly all of the hard fight
ing Sunday morning.
Ever your friend and brother,
W. H. 11. DAVIS.
EASY MONEY.
A western paper offers a prize for
money that will rhyme with the
name of Mr.’Mern, the vice-presiden
tial candidate on the Democratic
ticket.
Say, tell us who is Mr. Kern,
To whom the Democrats now turn,
Who is it sits back in the stern
Os Bryan’s craft, so taciturn
And takes the place others spurn?
Whose whiskers we can all discern,
Luxurious as any fern.
With curiosity; we burn,
Some facts about him we would
learn,
But still, no matter how we yearn,
Nobody seems to show concern,
Nobody seems to care a durn,
So we may just as well adjourn.

HENPECKED SAVAGES.
The most wonderful thing in this
world is the manner in which women,
who are undeniably at a disadvan
tage, manage the men. The Ameri
can Indian, although a savage, is hen
pecked. Mahomet had a number of
wives, but they all abused him, al
though he claimed to be a prophet in
constant communication with the
Most High. The law books are filled
with laws in the interest of women,
and men put them there at the dictar
tion of the women. Every man is
made to feel that he is not doing as
much as he should for his women
folks. Where did the suggestion come
from? From the women, who have
away of controlling the men. Every
man who breaks away from a wom
an’s control is punished by the other
women and made to feel that he is a
hopeless sinner. There are thousands
of rich women who do ridiculous
things over the protests of their men
folks. The men folks simply cannot
help themselves. The more advanced
the man, the greater the certainty
that he is controlled by his women;
whenever you find a man who con
trols at home you will find a bandit,
an idler, or a man who doesn’t
amount to much. — Atchison Globe.
JOTTINGS FROM THE ELBER
TON MEETING.

be dimmed by the shadow of defeat.
t introduce to you Thomas E. Wat
son, of Georgia.
When the applause subsided, Mr.
Watson surveyed the political field,
bringing out the undeniable similar
ity of the Democratic and Republi
can platforms and policies, and show
ing that there was not any real dif*
ferenee between the two and denounc
ing them both as utterly inimical to
the interests of the people. -He re
viewed the generous offer he himself
had made in reference to the State
electors and the blind folly which
rejected it.
The address was well received and
won hundreds of friends to the
cati§e.
Much of the success of both the
Elberton and the Royston meetings
was due to the personal attention giv
en to them by J. J. Brown, the well
known Jeffersonian Democrat, now of
Atlanta, but formerly of the section
in which the meetings were held. Mr.
Brown’s devotion to Populism, his
habit of making and keeping friends
and his unwearied worn, render him
a strong figure in the State.
“My husband,” said the fair bride,
“says I am his right hand.’*
“I hope,” rejoined her mother,
-“that he isn’t like that man who nev
er lets his right hand know what his
left hand does.” —Chicago News.

poor, deluded man! I never made a
bit of bread in my life until Aunt
Rebecca took that part of my edu

serial story which is now being pub
lished in your magazine.”
They both laughed like happy chil
dren. “We lost our identities that
time,” he said, when they had talked
it all over. “I must have played far
mer right successfully, though I
haven’t been an industrious one, cer
tainly. ”
“We were both incredibly dense,”'
she returned, “and it isn’t at all
flattering to our penetration. Had
you rather have me the rustic maid

There was nothing but perfect con
