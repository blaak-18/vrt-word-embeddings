T'IkREl .COIIIMESi) 'A TIME.
There comes a time whe goldea-hearted
Wll 'rld to twilat's chill emtrace.
When slghing wnade will shed the summer's
bloom
And waft their sweetness sate space.
When looks are gray
As winter's day.
And lips of faded red will rMy:
There comes a time when we grow old."
From far across the shoreless ocean's breast
The dying sunlight faintly streams.
While unseen barks are speeding o'er ta
Crest
And rosy hope is lost in dreams
For weary hand
The day hath spanned
And feebly trace o'er sallow sand:
" There comes a time when we grww old."
There comes a time when on the viewless
tide
Is heard the boding tone of tate:
When Galen's band is summoned to our
side
To cheek the toe within the gate.
Strict guard they keep.
Yet in our sleep
A voice comes whispering o'er the deep:
" There comes a time when we grow old."
uTnbroken shades ne'er traveled by the sun.
Form barriers round a dark domain
Where time's far-reaching stream shall never
run
Or measure death's unbreathing reign.
Forgetfulness
Rath come to bless,
And pallid Ips shall ne'er confess:
" There comes a time when we grow old."
There comes a time when watchers thro' the
night
In silence wait the coming day.
When ghostly tapers give their trembling
light.
And hope and hearts alike decay.
And then how dark!
But. oh. the spark
That onward guides the phantom bark
Where we shall never more grow old.

CONSOLATION.
A Bit of Friendly Sympathy That
Was Expensive.
It was Kitty who first suggested to
me that our prescription was not work
ing well. As soon as she spoke I wis
bound to admit it. I had thought that
Jack would easily get over his unfor
tunate attachment; I expected that,
after a few quiet weeks with us, he
would forget Clara Wilkinson and her
disgraceful treatment of him. She was,
in my opinion, a worthlesp girl, and I
grieved to see him take the affair so
seriously. And just at first he had ap
peared to rally. He had lecome more
cheerful, and more ready for society.
I said as much to Kitty, but she point
ed out that there had been a relapse.
In fact, she was emphatic on the ques
tion.
"lHe's getting no good here at all,"
she said most positively. "Really, in
his own interest, I must ask you to
send him away."
"The girl has spoilt his life!" I cried
angrily. Kitty looked at me for a mo
-nent, but said nothing.
"I suppose you're right." I went on.
"lIe would be better in a livelier
place."
"Of course he would, you dear old
stupid," said Kitty.
I did not see that I had been stupid.
"There is nothing to distract his
thoughts here," I said.
-"You speak to him then?" asked
Kitty. She was decidedly in earnest
about it.
"A woman does these things so deli
cately and tactfully," I suggested.
"Oh, I couldn't think of it, Robert,"
said Kitty, blushing. I admired her
delicacy.
lie was walking up and down the
gravel walk, hitting at my flowers (of
which I am rather proud) with his
stick, and smoking one of my cigars
(I'm a judge of cigars) at a ruinous
pace. When I loined him and linked
m·y arm through his, he started.
"Jack," said I, "wouldn't you be bet
ter away from here? Come, you know
what I mean. You're no great hand at
a secret."
"'I-I-" he began stammering, and
in great confusion.
"I know all about it." said I, encour
agingly. "I thought you'd get good out
of the place, but it's clear you haven't;
quite the contrary. You want to see
new things and new people; and for
get this-" I paused for a word and
ended, "this unhappy mistake of
yours."
"Upon my honor, you are a good
chap," he exclaimed. "There's not an
other man in England that would have
treated me as you have;" and he cov
ered his eyes with his hand.
"Oh, nonsense. It's nothing. I hope
I'm always ready to do my friends a
turn. But it's no use, is it? It gets
worse and worse."
"I'll go," he said, with a sigh. "I
won't stay a minute. After what you
say, I couldn't. And, old chap, I don't
know how to thank you. Many fel
lows would have taken the way I've
been going on badly; most would-"
"Oh, we made allowance for you.
Young men mustn't be judged too
harshly."
"But you're a true friend. It makes
me feel pretty bad, I can tell you,
Bob."
"Oh you'll soon forget it when you're
on the move."
"I'll try. By Jove, I will!" he ex
claimed, earnestly.
"Do; it only needs a little resolution.
Secause. between ourselves, you
know, you oughtn't to be inconsol
able."
"Eh'?"
"In my opinion, Jack, you've had an
escape. And you ean take my word
for it. Remember I know the lady
pretty well." In fact, I'd met Clara
Wilkinson a hundred times, and had a
perfectly definite opinion about her.
"Oh, you mustn't say a word against
her," he protested. "She's been all
thbat's good and kind and-"
"Qf oarse, you say that," I inter
.tpted, impatiently. "I suppose you're
-ukaL to, but it won't go down with
me. If ever there was a heartless,
,ortbless jade-"
*"W'bt" he cried, starting away from
aM;-ls I wast dtensidar be should
daw;l t'tl t
mmI
adrlft with-a laugh-that's what she
meant with you-Oh. I know her-no
one better!"
The unhappy young man turned pale
and his lips trembled.
"Now you know the truth about her
-and I hope you'll prooeed to put her
image out of your heart," I concluded.
"I'd have staked my life on her!" hU
murmured. "She-she seemed so dif
ferent. Bob, I couldn't help it, she
never-"
" x on were only the victim," I inter
rupted, patting his shoulder.
"I-I shall go at once. I can't stay
here. This revelation-you are telling
me the truth, Bob?"
"Honestly, to the best of my knowl
edge," I answered, firmly.
- "How awful!" said he.
"Surprised, are you? Why, any of
the fellows at the club could have told
you the same thing."
"Awful!" he murmured, gazing at
me.
"Come, come," said I. "it's possible
to make too much of such a trouble as
this. When one's eyes are once
opened-" and I ended with a shrug of
the shoulders.
Suddenly he held out his hand.
"Shake hands, old chap," he said.
I shook hands. The poor fellow
was a good deal moved, and I didn't
wish to appear cold.
"1 shall go straight," he repeated.
"Well, to-morrow morning will do."
"No. To-night-the next train. And
you-you must stay here?"
"Of course I stay here," I answered,
staring in my turn.
He sighed heavily.
"It's bad for me, old chap," he said,
laying a hand on my shoulder, "but,
by Jove, what it must be for you!"
"For me?" I exclaimed. "What d'ye
mean?"
"That woman!" he gasped. "And
hows you keep it up! One would think
to see you-well, well, its brave. It
would kill me in a month. It's brave,
that's what it is!"
"What in the world are you talking
about? I haven't spoken to her for
three years."
"Except before strangers? Good
heavens!"
"Not at all. I haven't-"
"Hush! here she comes! I-TI an't
meet her:"
"She here? Bosh!"
I turned round-and beheld my wife!
With a gasp I fell back a step. Jack
tore past Kitty and vanished through
the open windows of the drawing
room.
"WVell, was he reasonable?" asked
Kitty.
I could say nothing.
"I hope you were gentle with him.
Blob. lie's a nice boy, though he's a
particularly silly one. He meant no
harm, Bob."
"Wasas-ws-as he-?" [ stam
mered. "What the dickens does it
mean?"
"Only," said Kitty, coming close up
to me,."that he's quite forgotten Clara
Wilkinson, and-"
"Well?"
"That you've got rather a nice wife,
Bob." she whispered. "Did you say
anything about me, Bob?"
I looked at her for a moment.
"Heavens!" I cried, and rushed into
the house. That young man would go
add tell all the club that my wife and
I---oh, Lord!
"Jack, Jack, Jack, you young fool!"
I yelled.
The butler appeared.
"Mr. Vincent, sir, has just jumped
into the dog-cart, sir-it was at the
door by your orders-and driven off
like mad. lie said he was summoned
to London, sir!"
I sank down in a chair. Presently
Kitty came in. She was laughing.
"Oh, dear!" she said; "and I thought
you were so nice and considerate id
pretending not to see it!" And the
silly little woman went off into a fit of
giggling.
Then I told her the opinion of her
and of our domrestic happiness which
Jack Vincent was carrying away with
him. That sobered her; and we began
to send telegrams. But the young
ruffian (he may break his heart next
time, and welcome!) had gone straight
to the club.
WVhen I go there now they ask me,
sympathetically, if matters are "any
better?" I know what they mean.-

THE REPUBLICAN CLUB ROW.
Trouble Arising L etween the East and
the WVest Over the Sllver Qeestion.
The dissatisfaction among the re
publican clubs over the action of the
recent league convention at Denver, is
said to center in the attempt to dis
criminate against southern republic
ans and the frauds in the selection of
the next place of meeting, but it is
most probable that the real trouble
ties somewhat deeper.
The republican clubs are made up
largely of the "hustlers" of the party.
In the midst of a campaign their activ
ity is highly appreciated. They help
to raise money, disburse it in bribing
voters, furnish men to perpetrate
frauds on the ballot, and, in short, do
the rough work of the campaign, in
cluding some that is not to be dis
cussed in public. But the party does
not trust the clubsvery far in the mat
ter of laying down principles, or con
structing platforms.- A league conven
tion is looked forward to with appre
hension that some ungarded utterance
will do the party a disservice. -With a
view of heading off any such action on
the part of the "boys," a close watch
is kept over them by such of the party
leaders as can afford to attend the
gatherings, and the others generally
have representatives present with in
structions how to act. With all these
percautions, it is never certain that
some indiscretion will not be com
mitted.
The meeting at Denver this year
had its peculiar perils. Besides their
desire to unload Waite and his popu
list allies, the Colorado republicans
think of nothing but the free coinage
of silver at what they believe to be'the
divinely-appointed ratio of sixteen to
one.. -Now, the republican party de
sires to flirt with the extreme silver
men and to get their votes, but it has
no idea of committing itself to any
ratio. The leaders, therefore, looked
forward with apprehension to the in
fluence which the Colorado republicans
might exert upon the impressionable
young delegates in hours of social fes
tivity.
The president of the league had
been coached with reference to this
matter. He was careful to .warn the
convention in his address that they had
not come together to make a platform.
"Whatever statements may be made
bhere," he continued, "are but the ex
pressions of the individuals, and can
not in any way bind the future action
of the republican party." This utter
ance had a double purpose. It was in
tended to head off any indiscreet
action, if possible, and to prepare the
way, should any such action be had,
for declaring that it was not binding.
The Colorado republicans had their
own ideas about the matter. They
desired a straight deliverance in favor
of free coinage at the divinely-ap
pointed ratio. The Colorado league,
which held its convention at Denver,
after declaring for the ratio of six
teen to one, made an appeal to the
national convention in these words:
"We appeal to our guests from without the
state to listen to the cry of the thousands of
unemployed throughout the laud and to heed
the murmurs of business distress and diseon
tent, and to remember that the common people
believe in the money of the constitution. and
earnestly desire the coinage of both gold and
silver at a ratio fixedby nature and experience
under which the nation accomplished its great
est material achievements and reashed its
highest prosperity."
The Denver Republican seconded
this appeal, though in more guarded
terms. It told the convention that the
way to help to redeem Colorado from
populism was to adopt strong resolu
tions in favor of the restoration of sil
ver to its historic place, and. that it is
to the republican party that the people
must look for legislation fav.orablo to
silver. In several paragraphs and ed
itorials the convention was asked to
pass such resolutions favorable to sil
ver as would help the party in Colora
do. What that should be was plainly
intimated by a declaration that noth
ing but free coinage is needed to in
sure a pirity between the two metals.
The desire to get an expression in
favor of free coinage was at the bot
tom of the contest over the manner of
casting the vote, that is, whether the
delegates present should cast the en
tire vote of their states, or vote only
for themselves. The former plan gave
the east the major'ty and headed off
a free silver plank. How it operated
will appear from a single illustration.
New York was entitled to one hundred
and sixty-eight delegates, but only
forty were present. The determina
tion of the question, therefore,
decided whether New York should
cast one hundred and sixty
eight or forty votes. The western
delegates being present in greater
numbers, would have an immense ad
vantage on the "one 'delegate, one
vote" system. The delegates, however,
were permitted to east the entire vote
of their states, and this prevented any
controversy over the platform. The
silver resolution was in favor of "the
use of both gold and silver maintained
on a perfect parity and interconvertibil
ity." From a Colorado standpoint,
this is a "gold-bug" resolution, inas
mich as it ignores the "ratio fixed by
nature," upon which the Colorado eon
vention insisted. A Denver corre
spondent says that the "action of the
league has been the most majestic
method of committing political sui
cide ever known in this section of the
country." The western states were
particularly unhappy because WVyo
ming voted with the east.
As to the frands perpetrated in
counting the votes on the selection of
a place of meeting, the "boys" seem
to take t too seriously. Republicans
must keep in practice in thte perpetra
tlon of fraudulent counts, and to do
this they occasionally exercise their
talents on one another. Nothing
oould be more natural than that-

THE SUGAR TRUST.
A Corrupt system That WNe seem Creast
by the MeElaley Tar .
A protective tax on the raw material
of any industry compels that industry
to either form a trustor go out of busi
ness. The trust may be public or pri
vate-a chartered corporation or a
mere selling agreement-but the in
dustry must control the selling price
in order to recoup from the people the
tax it pays into the treasury. It must
destroy domestic competition or sus
pend business.
When to raise revenue in 1864 a tax
of three cents per pound on the raw
material of sugar was imposed on the
refineries, the duty of five cents levied
on any refined sugar that might be im
ported (none was) did not raise the do
mestic market price, which was fixed
by the domestic competition of the re
fineries. The refineries had to unite
and agree to raise the price in order to
recover the tax. In other words, they
had to form a trust and farm the rev
enues or go out of business.
To keep them from loss they were
authorized to tax the people five cents
extra for refined sugar and protected
from foreign competition up to that
amount; but they had to protect
themselves from domestic competition
by forming a trust, by making a
selling agreement one with another,
by which the five cents could be col
lected. There was no other way to
get it..
The private sugar trust-or selling
agreement-is over thirty years old. It
has controlled the market price, paid
its, taxes into the treasury, and not
only recouped these taxes from the
general public, but made enormous
profits from farming the revenues in
addition to the normal profits of re
fining.
The public sugar trust organized five
years ago was an attempt by seven of
the forty-nine refineriea to sell their
future profits in farming the revenues
for a lunp sum-sixty million dollars.
The stock did not represent capital in
vested in plant, only the right to farm
the revenue. The other refineries were
not in it-are not now in it. But all
the refineries are in the private sugar
trust, including those in the public
sugar trust.
The objection to taxing the raw ma
terial of sugar is that it necessarily
creates a public or private trust, that
it necessarily legalizes a trust to collect
from the people the tax which the re
fineries must pay into the treasury.
The industry must have a trust in
order to "farm the revenue," and un
less it farms the revenue (taxes the
people) it would be taxed out of ex
istence by the tax on its raw material
The objection to the tax on raw
sugar applies to all raw materials.

REACHED THE BOTTOM.
Western Republicans Repudiate Thels
Own Action on the Silver uestion.
The California republicans have
reached the bottom of the hill. Mr.
Bland himself might have written the
silver plank which was adopted with
"great enthusiasm" at the recent state
convention at Sacramento. The Cali
fornia republicans declare in favor of
"the free and unlimited coinage of sil
ver at the ratio of 16 to 1, and the mak
ing of silver, as well as gold, a legal
tender in payment of debts, both pub
lic and private." To give practical et
feet to this lunacy, they pledge their
congressional nominees to the sup
port of the principles contained in the
free coinage resolution.
Here is a sad deterioration from the
position taken by a majority of the re
publican representatives from Califor
nia in the present congress with re
gard to the free coinage of silver at
the ratio of 16 to I. It may be remem
bered that last summer, when the ques
tion of repealing the silver claurses of
the Sherman act was under considera
tion, Mr. Bland tested the sentiment
of the house on this issue by offering
an amendment providing for free coin
age at 16 to I. How did the three Cal
ifornia republicans stand the test?
Only one of them, Mr. Bowers, voted
with Mr. Bland. The other two,
Messrs. Hilborn and Loud, cast their
votes against the proposal.
In the senate, on a similar test, the
result was the same. Mr. Perkins, the
republican senator for California.
voted against the free coinage amend
ment which Mr. Peffer, of Kansas, in
troduced in connection with the Sher
man repeal bill. Thus the pledge just
given by the Sacramento convention
is a repudiation of the action taken by
the republican senator and the major
ity of the republican representatives
on this momentous question. It is a
direct rebuke which cannot but have a
very demoralizing effect upon these
members of congress. If a free coin
age proposal at the ratio of sixteen to
one should come up again either in the
present session or during the short ses
sion that will follow. it seems entirely
probable that Mr. Bland could count
upon the support of the entire repub
lican delegation from California, and
that in the senate also free coinage
would gain an adherent at the expense
of the honest money cause.-Boston

VERITABLE HANGING GARDENS.
trw Ia Na Pesmi bs to save ileemies a
Tos to Ca.e "re.
Few houses which are provided with
either a balcony or a veranda are' now
left without some attempt at flokl dec
oration for the summer, and many .of
these places are veritable "banging
gardens" most delightful, even to those
who pass by them, while their owner
is also cheered and refreshed by the
fragrance and beauty of fresh flowers.
Where there are permanent creepers,
such as Virginia creepers, white jas
mine, wisteria, or honeysuckle, much
less will need to be done than where
the walls are bare,for luxuriant wreaths
of greenery are necessary as a back
ground to flowers, and where there is
iron-work to be covered it is impossible
to have too many creepers.
Many choose a single variety for a
balcony, the bright blossoms of scarlet
or purple showing to good advantage
above the green leaves of the creepers
that hang like drapery over .the stone
or iron work of the balcony. All these
creepers do best in boxes about a foot
deep, well drained with crocks and
ashes, and filled with a rich light com
post, such as that sold by the horticul
turists as potting soil.
It should be borne in mind that no
plant can be expected to make fine and
rapid growth unless it is well support
ed both by a rich soil and a plentiful
supply of water, with more room for
the development of its roots than is de
sirable in the case of flowering plants
in pots, where blossom is the great de
sideratum.
Boxes, wherever used. can easily be
hidden by an arrangement of flower
ing plants in pots (these being covered
with moss), kept in place by a strip of
wire netting, or hidden by trailing
plants round their edge. Ivy leaved
geraniums are excellent trailers, both
from a box or hanging in baskets, and
there are so many varieties that the
shade which will harmonize well with
neighboring plants can easily be se
lected. Dark blue lobelia, golden
moneywort, rich bronze lace, hanging
in festoons from "mother 'o thou
sands" (Saxifraga sarmentosa), and the
delicate spraysof Nierenbergia gracilis
(pale mauve and white), will all fringe
a balcony, fill a basket, or hide the pots
and boxes of a group of plants in a ve
randa satisfactorily; nasturtiums, too,
of the tall variety will be found very
useful, for they will grow in any aspect
and in any air, not being at all partic
ular, either, in the matter of soil. while
their bright flowers ranging from deep
maroon to pale primrose, are sure to, be
borne in profusion.
For the central groups, opposite the
windows (or at other salient points),
semi-tropical foliage plants. such as
Ricinus, Canna indica, variegated
maize (Zea japonica variegata), palms,
eucalyptus trees, and the hardier dra
ctenas-should be used as a background,
with brilliant tuberous begonias, pela
goniums, heliotrope, ealceolarias, lilies,
gladiolus, and many other flowers (in
pots hidden with moss) in front.
If stands are used they should be of
wire in preference to wood, and the
successful effort of the whole will be
in proportion to the cleverness display
ed in grouping the plants and hiding
everything except them by means of
moss, virgin cork or trailing plants.
Plenty of moss will also prevent (if it
be regularly damped daily) the too
rapid evaporation which tries all plants
when suspended, so to speak, in mid
air.--Chicago Tribune.
A Comfortable Lounge.
Any one with the most ordinary in
genuity can make a most luxurious
couch at a very small expense. Select
a good woven-wire spring, single
width or narrower than the regulation
single width if possible, and to this
fasten legs of suitable length. These
should be sawed in at the upper end to
make a shoulder on which the length
wise bar of the wire spring can rest.
Then with a three-eighth-inch hit bore
two holes through the leg and the side
of the spring. Put in bolts of suitable
size; tighten nuts with a wrench. This
last is an important item, as unless the
bolts are carefully secured they will
work loose and may split the wood.
Here is the foundation for something
comfortable. All the cushion that is
necessary is two or three comfortables
folded to the proper size and shape, or,
what is better, a two-inch-thick hair
mattress. This should be secured to
spring by straps and buckles or strong
cords. Over this throw a Turkish cov
er or any suitable drapery. Pile on the
pillows, and the article is complete.

To Iemove Whitewash Stains.
The stains of whitewash are best re
moved from glass with a knife or a
scraper. Similar stains on woodwork
are easily removed with warm water
and a brush, making little circular
strokes, instead of lengthwise ones,
and wiping up the whitewash, or soft
cloth dipped in warm water. When a
house has been plastered, after the
mason has cleaned, it will be founnd
that there is a great deal of lime and
plaster remaining behind. This must
be thoroughly scraped off and swept
up, and then the floors should be thor
oughly serubbed in warm water soft
ened by ammonia. It will require two
or three scrbbings before the floors
are absolutely elear.-N. Y. Tribune.
Arrnsement of Curtaln~a.
A new way of solving the curtain
question that is certainly convenient
and by no means ugly, is to have two
sets of sash curtains, one for the upper
and one for the lower half of a twin
dow. Both are hung on rods. and con
siast of two parts, so that they can be
parted in the middle. The upper set
should be made long enough to fall
abant an inch over the top of the lower
set They may be made of muslin,
silk, or other t6brie. with edges

SIMPLE BEDROOM.. '
A*seamueas ormmeeas 1 In
Among the .many Absurdities tma:
have crept into our houses there is .eifi
more absurd than the elaborate b-e.a
room. Copied like our elaborate-.=-'
lore, from great mansions of a1ttet,3
add nothing of comfort to our amk
life. The fashion of the elaborate.4
room descends from that aneient- ti
when it was not considered bad .tý
to make the bedroom also a rept
room, where the lady of the eas
clad in a gorgeous gown and surr id
ed by stately trappings of. rarnk,. re
ceived her morning callers. Tkus
Queen Elizabeth received messengers
of state, and it was necessary in m
eases to add a certain elabor -ion
and magnificence to the outfit of "thlis~'
room.
All this seems indelicate and coarse,
to our more refined age. The sleeping
room is essentially as it should bh, a
private apartment. Only in boarding
houses, where space is valuable, and
where we have the folding-bed, thats
piece of fuprniture that contrives
"A double debt to pay,
A bed by night, a chest of drawers by dayf"
do we have a sleeping-room made
into a reception. In a private house,
where space is not valuable, such an -
arrangement would be inexcusable.
All such polygenous furniture is simply
a makeshift to save space. In the -
country where there is ample roomats
there is no apology or excuse for it.
The best taste of the present day r
clares that bedsteads and bedding shadl
be as simple as possible to make them
comfortable. Heavy carven bedsteaýs
of wood are no longer in favor, butfIn
place of them are brass bedsteads of
simplest construction, every part of
which can be reached by a duster.
Where the brass bedstead is objected
to on the score of expense, an Iron bed
stead may be chosen, made with a
somewhat lighter frame of rods of iron
in the same general style as a brass
bedstead. These iron bedsteads are
enameled white, and are sometimes
trimmed with brass. A pure white
bedstead is generally to be preferred,
and such a one four feet -aix in widt*,
may be purchased at as low a figure as
ten dollars. The only elaboration that
is allowable about the bed is the use of
drapery or a half-tester at the head;
and this is a matter of taste. It cer
tainly gives a dainty finish to a simple '
bedstead.
All stuffy mattresses or elaboration
of mattresses are now done away with
and a single hair mattress resting on
woven wire springs is considered a
sufficient substitute for the mass of
feather beds and double beds formerly
used. Even the pillows are sometimes
left off the bed, and a single bolster,
covered with some fine material to
match the counterpane, is sometimes
used.
The washstand is another piece of
furniture that has undergone a thor
ough remodelling. The modern wash
stand, with its shut-up compartments
below, is quite often superseded by the
open washstand made of thin sheets of
enamelled white. The chest of draw
ers or old-fashiened bureau and the
picturesque low dressing-table, are al
most the only pieces of furniture, ex
cept the chairs, that are made of wood
in the fashionable bed-room. Even the
dressing-table is quite frequently an
old-fashioned Duchesse table--an affair
of muslin frills and silk ribbon.-N. Y.

PARENTS AND CHILDREN.
One View of the Oblilgatons Existing Be
tween Them.
It seems to me, said a woman who
had spent a long life battling with un
favorable circumstances, that there is
a grave misapprehension about the
obligation of children to parents. I
think the first obligation should be
from the parent to the child. If pa
rents have children, they are by the
fact of bringing them into existence
responsible for their mental, moral and
physical well-being up to their major
ity,. and they should under no circum
stances forget that such obligations
rest upon them.
In the first place, they ought to be
morally certain that they will be in a
condition to give their children educa
tion enough to fit them for their posi
tion in life. If the child shows any
particular talent, the parents are under.
just as much obligation to cultivate
this as they are to give the little one
proper food and clothing. As they
grow up, the youngsters should have
reasonably good society and the sur
roundings to give them a proper famil
iarity with the usages of the world. To
rear a child in total ignorance of the -
good graces and courtesies of life is litr
tie short of a crime. Of course, if par
ents are ignorant themselves, they
have justso much to struggle with -
and as children grow older special
pains should be taken to bring them"
into contact with other younng people
and to put them into society of. thIr.
own age.
Of all the melancholy situationa 1*E
life, that of a brilliant young pers ai'a
a community where there is nkothiig
congenial is about the worst. Schp~c
sons, especially girls, are boundi
