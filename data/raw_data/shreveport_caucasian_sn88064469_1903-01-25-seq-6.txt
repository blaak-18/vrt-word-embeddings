Washington, Jan. 19.-Senautor Pei
kins of Califolnia, who was recently
re-elected to another term in the upper
branch of congress, used to be fond of
playing the role of IIaroun-al-lt:schiod,
and many are the stories told of his
experiences in the mining camps of the
Pacific coast. where he "grub staked"
more than one struggling fellow less
fortunate and successful than himself.
He knew hew it was himself to strug
gle with adverse fate. When he land
ed on the-Pacific coast, forty or fifty
years ago, a poor sailor boy, he had lit
tie except what nature had endowed
him with-strong, willing hands, a
clear and active brain and a determina
tion to win success and fortune. With
these he surmounted every obstacle
and is now not only a rich man, but a
useful and 110on

with the red shirted mniqers and swap
ping yarns and tobacco with them. One
big fellow became quite enthusiastic in
praise of 'that fellow Perkins" who
had just [een appointed to the Utited
Stat . senate. He praised him inordi
nately,. and the new senator's curiosity
was aroused to know the reason for the

plataeqd that Perkins had once kept a
small t.ste and used 'to grub stake him
with becm antd cofee.

Senator Nelson and Representative
Eddy of Minnesota were the recipients
of a fine haunch of
Nelson and 'venison the other day
fromt friends at home.
the Although it is against
Coantraband the law to take venison
Venison out of the state at this
" season of the year, the
Minnesota statesmen had it cooked in
the senate restaurant and-invited their
friends to a good old western venison
dinner. 'Ihen all went down into Sena
tor Nelson's committee room and sat
before an open wood fire smoking pipes
and( telling stories of early Minnesota
days.
The next day the ungrateful col
leagues of the two statesmen started
the story that they, had violated the
game laws. They threatened to send it
broadcast through the state to make all
kinds of trohble for their hosts.
"I plead sanctuary," said Senator
Nelson. "The venison was cooked otn
government reservation. Moreover, if
you tell on us I will call you ungriate
ful and quote the paragraph from the
Bible about the serpent's tooth, and
that will fix you, all right."

Sence-Shattuc is partial
to gorgeous waistcoats, while Norton
affects the statesmanlike frock coat.
The other day they met in the main
aisle of the house in front of the speak
er's desk and saluted each other with a
deep bow.
"Ah, my dear Alphonse," said Dr.
Norton,-"I observe that you have no
posy today. Permit me," wherewith
he, took from his own lappel a blushing
carnation and with another sweeping
bow presented it.
"Ah, my dear Gason." said the gen
eral, "I thank you," bowing as low as
his rotund figure would permit and pin
nl'ng the flower to the lapel of his own
coat.
Then, arm in arm, they stalked out of
the door nearest the house restaurant
amid the genetml clapping of hands of
their colleagues who. l-d witnessed the
Incident.
Representative Fordney of Michigan,
who, by the way, is one of the best sto
ry tellers of the house,
was once called as a
lumber expert in a
lawsuft at Saginaw.
L. awers The trial turned on the
question whether mer
Irantable lumber had been furnished
io provided in a contract. FThe lawyer
a' the opposing side was a very voeit

Iad 'who was also much given to
s ~mding the table with his flats.
"What do you regard as merchaqt

tresent representative on the cross ex
imination.
"Why, lumber that can be sold at a
prnt," repled the wise Fordney.
'Ihe lawyer paeded o. the table, en

"Ah, ou don't, do .you? Well, what

Boedtey. "Take a lawyer, for instance,
who tries his case witth his brains. I
would ca him-a rachan table lawyeI,
-But one who tries his case with his.

That .ended the cros examination.
