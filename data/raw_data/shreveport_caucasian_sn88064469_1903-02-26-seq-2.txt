SEVERAL ARE KILLED
The Deplorable Afair Happened at
Newark, N. J., sad the Victims
Were Pupils on Their Way
to the High School.
Newark, N. J., Feb. 20.-Running
at almost full speed a train on a Dela
ware, Lackawasna and Western rail
road crashed into a trolley car load
ed with pupils on their way to the
high school yesterday morning.
Eight of nine children were killed.
and at least fifteen injured, some so
badly that it is feared they will die.
The accident occurred at the Clifton
avenue crossing, long noted as a dan
gerous spot. The trolley car was one
of the special vehicles which the
North Jersey Street Railway company
runs between 8 and 9 o'clock five
mornings in the week for the special
aecomodation of the high school pu
pils. It was crowded with young men
and women from all parts of the city.
many whom were transferred from
other lines. Immediately after the ac
cident had been reported all the police
reserves of the Second precinct were
sent to the scene to keep back the
crowd, which gathered almost imme
diately.
The train which caused the accident
wasp the Delaware and Passaic ex
press. There is some question as
whether both the crossing gates were
dow* when the ear and train ap
proached at the same time. The mo
terfman` saw the train and put on the
brakes with all his force. The car,
however, slid upea the icy rails until
the front platform projected over the
tracks. A moment later the crash

esillalon were precipitated under the

Columbia, S. C., Feb. 2O.--Chief Jun
Uee Pope reused the application for
ball of James H. Tillman. It was the
role of the court, he said* in such
eases, to make no explanation of the
reasons governing the decision.
"Murder was the taking of human
life with malice aforethought. With the
eath of omfce so recent upon his lips
he must do his duty and decline the
application without prejudice to the
case of the defendant.
A multitude of aldavits, covering
the case with an infinity of detail, were
presented by the state and a large
number in reply were read for the
defendant. The state presented a
number of afdavits from Edgefeld
people impepching the testimony of
the amant Holtzbake, and also declar
ing that the aiflant White was a para
lytic past fifty years old, the result of
paralysis being to weaken the will
power and moral nature of the afant.
The defense replied with amdavits sus
taining the reputation of Holtzbake
and the competency of v hite. The
state presented pMdavita from Repre
sentative Lancaster of Spartanburg
that he saw a pistol in Tillman's pock
et on the day preceding the shooting.
and another from a Columbia gun
smith that F. H. Dominick of New
berry. previous to the shooting,
brought him a magazine of a pistol
and that he repaired it.
F. J. Watson of The State newspa
per swore to a conversation with Till
man last summer, in which the latter
requested him to tell Gonzales substan
tdally that a continuance of the news
paper attacks would be at his peril.
Watson declined to convey the mes
sage.
0. D. Black, a railroad man, made
affidavit that Tillman told shim on a
train and again In August, that he
was going to kill Gonzales. exhibiting
the magazine pistol. Robert Lathan.
Mr. Gonzales stenographer, swore to
a statement of Mr. Gonzales taken by
him when near death, relating to the
story of the shooting.
Mr. Gonzales declared he had sent
Til1nsan no message and considered
the matter ended.
Several well-known citizens of Co
lumbia who saw the shooting testified
that Gonzales made no threatening mi

Jones ea0 the Sometimes they get ap
"Toucher" polntments in some of
the departments and
sometimes go into the practice of law
here, as most of them are lawyers.
Now and then one becomes a member
of the "third house" and occasionally
one develops into what is known as a
"toucher," with no visible means of
support other than what he is able to
borrow from his more fortunate ac
quaintances.
Apropos of the "toucher" this story is
told:
An old man who was a senator be
fore the civil war haunted the chamber
at times and occasionally succeeded in
negotiating a loan from one of his
former colleagues. Senator Jones of
Nevada, who had known and liked
him in his better days, often tided him
over serious difficulties and rarely
turned a deaf ear to his importunities.
On one occasion the ex-senator went to
Mr. Jones and said:
"Senator. I have got to go away for
six months, and it would be a great ac
commodation to me if you could let me
have $50 for that time."
"Suppose you make it a year," re
plied the Nevada senator, "and I'll
make it a hundred."
"I will do it," emphatically remarked
the "ex," and the bargain was made.
The strangest part of it is that the
man actually stayed away a year. and
Senator Jones considered the $100 rea
sonably well invested.
The status of Nevada In the Union
was touched upon in the senate the
other day in the course of the debate

art, sometimes called "Old Father
Time." promptly showed up and de
tended his state.
"Didn't the senator himself." asked
Senator Beveridge, "advocate the an
nexation of Nevada and Utah?"
"I never advocated the annexation of
Nevada to Utah," replied Sgator Stew
art. "but I was willing thatf!tah should
be annexed to Nevada."
Senator Stewart did not seem to un
derstand why everybody should laugh.

recounted the hardships he had en
dured and urged the old comradet to
vote for him.
"At the senator's fourth meeting in
the district Mr. Chaney was present
and after the senator's speech th"
chairman called upon Mr. Chaney. He
too, had a stereotyped speech, in which
he said it was the regret of his life that
his parents were not married a few
years sooner, so that he might have
been born in time to join the Union
army, and told his hearers what a leg
acy it would have been to his children
had he been able to don the blue, shoul-=
