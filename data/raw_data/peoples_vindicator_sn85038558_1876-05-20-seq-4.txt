The unprecedented sunecess with which
the Times has met, since its establiLsh
ment, is convincing evidence that the
people of the West and South, fully ap
preciate the efforts of a journal, whiich,
in addition to its enterprise as a newe
paper, has the courage to boldly declare
and constantly maintain the principles
of its political faith.
The public journal mostly deserving or
Democratic support is the one that, in
addition to being a full and faithful and
consistent advocate of Democratic prin
siples, A Democratle newspaper is the
aewspaper for Democrate to support, anid
the 1des sometimes'sought to be isculca
ted bChose who have an interest of their
owa fn doig so that the people must go
outstle their party organ to "flnd the
ews," is absurd and irrational. Thlere
lr no gort of incompatibility whatever
between the politiceal and non-political
journal as to the matter of news; many
of the papers now published thromghout
the country, and eepeciadly valuable for
gale amount anl variety of their intel
ligence, being also known for the ability
and earsnestness with which they cham
plea their peculiar party views. Hence
all1 thilgs else glang equal, ir is manifLet.
ly the duty of ~I)moerats to limit their
newspaper patronage to such as are of
their own way of thinking, and not to
squander their means on those that wage

convictions.
It is our desire to see the Times in the
band of all I)emoerats, and every well

WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1876.
Ch' mpion American Comic Paper !
Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
can artists, and contributed to by the
most popular humnorists and satirists of
the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfillly up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the established humorous and
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as a
monthly, then, to satisfy the demand of
the public, it waIs changed to a frtnight.
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
the political and social shams by its
masterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater success than
beforei, and was recognized as thu ablest
and brightest of itsclass. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
ing the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnish illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth. Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels,
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to fame.
In its literary departments Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account many be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fas
tidious.

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
"What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR BIT
rERs I" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessiug the remarkable qualities of Vnx
EsAR BITTERS in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of DR. WALK
ER'S VINElAR BITTERS are A perient, Dia
phoretic. Carminative, Nutritious, Laxa
tive, Diuretic, Sedative, Counter-Irritant,
Sudorific, Alterative, and Anti-Bilious.

Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro

with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to Dit. J. WALKER'S VINEGARlm
BITTERS, as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
aind generally restoring the healthy func
tions of the digestive organs.
