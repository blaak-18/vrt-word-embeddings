U. F. dbmerts Woodworth, Vis.W, t
writes to the -Orange ud4 Lurmer: My
hen hounse illustrated herewith is 18xt4 bui
feet with 12 foot posts. This gives two WI
tories with as much Loor room above vid
as below. It stands on a stone under- an
pianing laid up solid with mortar. Th
Each story is divided into two rooms. - the
one 16x16 feet. the other 8x16 feet The are
lower floor is of -clay and is raised 8 net
inebes higher than the level of the ,o
ground putside. This insures its per- thu
tect dryness and in fact it is dusty dir
every day in the year. The 16x16 room w
below is the roosting, laying and feed- do
ing room. When the ground is not mi
frozen they are fed outside. The Saltx f1
room is the sitting-room or hatchery. op
It is often used for other purposes. For an
instance as soon as cold weather came, trc
we put in three stolen broods about ha
a quarter gown. It was a nice place th,
for them and they were better separat- ca
ed from the rest. The outside door of
this sitting-room opens into a yard. 10
15x24 feet, closed by pickets. So when g
a few cockerels are kept over to be
slaughtered for the table, the hatch
ing-room and yard make a convenient
place for them. The upper floor is
divided into the same sized rooms as
those below. The large one is used in
winter for what might be called a
calisthenic gallery or exercising room.
An inch or more of sawdust covers the
floor. If "'tailings" are fed, some are
scattered on the sawdust. Ear corn is
usually kept on the floor all the time T.
for the hens to pick at. They seem in
to enjoy themselves scratching in th
the sawdust. During. summer the
hens use it more or less to lay in, a few li
loose boxes with nest eggs being placed v
around the sides. The 8x16 room above
is used as a storeroom and in winter is
a good place to jail broody hens. In a
summer a rectangular coop twelve feet
long and three feet wide is used for el
it

this purpose. The roosts in the lower
l6x16 are placed over a sloping plat- 14
form ten feet wide and fourteen long. 1;
A partition which reaches from the a
floor to the platform divides the living r
room into two equal parts. Under this f
platform is situated the laying-room. i
furnished with fixed nests. s
The light only reaches this from the t
open entrance from the feeding-room. d
An abundance of dust is kept stored in i
the laying-room and is used all times of t
the year to scatter under the roosts I
and prevent decay and had smell of thef.
dropping"""There is a special - box of i
i-s placed in a sunny corner where
the hens can dust themselves at pleas
ure. There are absolutely no lice in
my chicken-house, and the liens keep 1
themselves free from body lice by dust
ing. Neitheris there any leg scale dis- t
ease among my fowls, nor have they i
ever had cholera. My argument in
brief is a perfectly dry dirt floor, plen
ty of room and plenty of dust. 1 never I
set hens until June and want the chick
ens hatched in July. Hot weather is f
just the thing for them. At five months t
old the pullets are laying and continue
to lay throughout the winter. The
profit is in the eggs.
TIMELY SUGGESTIONS.
How Roads Can Is Mlade Good In a Feu
Years.
Good roads can be made in the fol
lowing manner: G(rade them to about
two feet in the center; cut a ditch on
each side of road: put tile in it large
enough to carry water from same: cut
your ditch not over two feet. deep;
have a good outlet for your tile and
your road will be dry.
Now haul sand, gravel or crushed
stone, whichever is the netlrest to your
roan1 Hlaul two loads on top of tach
other. Leave half of road bare so
people can drive on it when weather is
dry.
W\here there is sand or gravel within
five nmiles of the road it can be put on
at small expense. Fonr mills on eve-ry
dollar of valuation for five years will
t pay for it, or twenty milJs in all: four
mills on the dollxr the farmer would
not feel very much. and in five years
he would have all good roads.
k iet every landowner or taxpayer
i, haul at the rate of SI.t Ja day for team
If and driver in summer and autumn,
p when the roads are dry. say three
a weeks and three loads a day, and in
e fvre years all roads will be good. T~et
those who have no teams pay for their
hauling.--C.. L. Mcinzer, in Farm, Field
and Fireside.
AMONG THE POULTRY.
PortlTnv should have plenty ,tf grit
They cannot grind thelr food without
it.
WHEN fattening fosvls do not let
them run with the fol.s I that are not
fattening.
SKEEP the hens wartn at night. if
you wish theln to lay, and do unot crosvd
them.
ONCE in awhile stir a spoonful of
sulphur into the feed. It tones up the
system.
IF the hens show a disposition to get
too fat., with proper feeding, fatten
them to the full exteslt and eat or mar
ket them.
AN exchangs says that charcoal t" a
good fattening food for turlke"s. hr_ is
good only because it helps diges-S.n
and absorbs the gases. Charcon. is
fierst--rte for fowls, but in itself it ha-s
no fattening prc-perties. - Farmer's
Voice.
Cl edes i'etrcenm o, Roosts.
Crude petroleum should he applied to
the roostr. occasionally, in order to
guard against lice. During the few
C. warm days that are li-able to ocuenr in
winter, with the animal heat of the
bodies of the hens, the house will
sometimes be warm enough to enable
at lice to work. Kerosene is irritating
to the feet of the fowls. and for that
Sreason we suggest the use of crude P
Stroleum instead.

LAROE FAnM BARN.
The manure gutter is 16 inches wide, 68 c
inches deep at one end, and 8 inches at a
the other end, with a conducting spout at
running to the manure pile, where the ,
liquid manure can be run into a reser
voir if needed. The gutter is covered C
with strips of strong timber 1x134 inch- of
es, and placed 1,14 inches apart. They bi
are made into doors opposite each stall
so that they can be raised up to be
cleaned. There is also a board, 10 h2
inches wide, nailed on the side of the E
gutter, under the hind feet of the ani
mals, thus making the gutter, or drain.
age rather, really 26 inches wide. This
kind of gutter has many advantages
over the open drain. The cows are
kept as clean as possible, we think; w
and there is no danger of a cow, heavy t1
with calf, being injured by stepping
backward into the ditch. The ditch st
receives all the water and a great deal q
of the manure, which is tramped' a
through; and it can be cleaned out a
every other day. ir
The horse stable is 17 feet wide and at
.3 feet long and 8 feet high, di-. e
vided into five 5-foot stalls and one
box stall. The floor is graded so as to n
slope back behind the middle of the u
stall into a shallow gutter. They are s,
all fed from the barn floor. C
The barn floor is 18 feet wide, 36 feet it
long, and 14 feet high to loft. It is '
laid double: the floors overhead are el
single. There is a platform 8 feet high tl
running across the rear end of the'
, floor. Under this platform at one end
is the cistern; at the other end are the
stairs to the loft. Under the middle of
the platform is a door 10 feet wide to g
drive out at, and on top of the platform to
1 is another door 10 feet wide forguU.,'

THE ART OF BREEDING.
To TMa.ter It ItCUIPre Illstelljigence an
bard work.
n It seems poor economy for farmers
n to attempt to pose as breeders and es
Y tablish a herd of thoroughbreds on the
II simple knowledge of how to feed hogs
ir for market, yet hundreds of men are
Id doing it annually. As a rule, unless
rs they are men who have that spirit in
them that will not submit to a failure,
er tlhey generally retire from the business
m the second year. To become a
n. breeder means more now than it did
e years ago, says the Swine Hireeder.
in The business has advanced, it is out of
et sight of the time in which the owner
ir ship of a pig sired by a prize winner
Id signified the breeding of fine stock. To
do this a knowledge of the entire
science is necessrary. One must know
pedigree, the standard, feeding and
management, and these he must know,
not as his forefathers, but fully up to
ut the advanced knowledge of the active
men of to-day. The signs of the time
et in everything point towards a record.
ot In the breeding ring as In the speed
ring. to be a suneeess one must have a
if record and tlhat record must mark
vd high. The best records in the speed
ring are made in front of the pneu
of matic sulkies. Thie best records in the
he breeding ring are made by those who
employ every means to obtain knowl
-t edge: no one can to-day make much
n proercss in the science of breed unless
ar- hIe takes advantage of all means that
are now offered for studytng the busi
a ness and.acquiring the work of the
is past years, and upon that foundation
n build up a business that will be in har
is mony wvith the standard and progress
as of the times.

What to do with Milk Pails I
Clean them with Pearline. You can't get
them so thoroughly sweet and pure in any
other way. Besides, it's easier for you
quicker, more economical.
S " The box and barrel churn are not hard
to keep clean. A little hot water and a little
Pearline will clean any churn or do away
with any bad odor."- The Dairy World, Chicago.
Perhaps you think that some of the imita
tions of Pearline. that you'd be afraid to
use in washing clothes, -would do just as
well in work like this. They wouldn't
hurt tinware, certainly. But they wouldn't
clean it, either, half as well as Pearline-besides, " don't
play with the fire." If your grocer sends you an imitation,
be honest-send it back. 400 JAMES PYLE. New York.
