liff Dw lli ment to Preserve

[Special Corrcsponf.lence.]
Albuquerque N. M.. Jan. 13.-The re
cent meeting of the .Arclhaologic:al in
stitute has revived public interest in
this territory as possessing niore relics
of historic value than any other part of
the United States. The iulpetus thus
given to the study of New Mexico's
archaeological remains has been
strengthened by a statement made by
former Governor Prince, himself an
archaeologist of repute. during a visit
to New York. IHe found the people
of the east desirous of learning more
about New Mexico than they have
been taught in the past, and the state
ment given by him covers the ground
with great exactitude.
In beginning Governor Prince said
that the antiquities of New Mexico
might be divided into four classes. First
there were the prehistoric relies, which
,were in existence when Columbus dis
covered America. Then there were the
structures of the Pueblo Indians. dat
ing from the Spanish conquest to the
present time: Next tlhre were the evi
dences of the Spanish and Mexican
regimes, and. fourthly, the landmarks
of the old Santa Fe trail and the influx
of Americans from the east.
He said that the degree of interest
taken in the preservation of antiquities
and the means for their preservation
were very much less in this region than
In the richer and more advancled por
tiona of the country. Here the ener
,gles of the people were absorbed iii
their struggle for the ni emsitlCi of
life. There were few of the class, to
be fontal so numerously In New York,.
for instance. who have time; taste and
means for pursuing archbtological re
search.

On the east side of the Rio Grande
are the remains of a series of towns
which were occupied at the time of the
Spanish explorations and up to 150
years ago. In each of these was a
church, built by the Franciscan fa
thers, but they are all falling to pieces
from neglect.
Governor Prince, who had just been
reading the minutes of the last meet
ing of the trustees of the American
Scenic and Historic Preservation soci
ety, in which mention was made of the
sale of old custom house documents in
New York for waste paper, said he was
reminded thereby of the action of Gov
ernor Pyle of New Mexico, who some
forty years ago signalized his admin
istration by selling a quantity of old
Spanish archives to grocers and mer
chants in which to wrap their butter
and other goods. One merchant, more
appreciative than the governor of the
value of the documents which came
into his possession, preserved them,
and they were eventually returned to
the government. They included some
very valuable legal documents.
Foremost of the relics of the Span
lsh and i Mexican regimes is the old
governor's palace in Santa Fe. Gov
ernor Prince unhesitatingly declared
that. "barring none, this 'is the .most
historic building in the United States."
it had been the focus nod headquar
ters of all authority in the southwest
for 250 years. The history of that
whole region is coucentrated in this
one building, which ha, been in ex
Istence since the biginning of Spanish
exploration.
There are also; continued the gov
er.nor interesting relics of the days of
Genera li"earny and Kit Carson that
-aght to receive protective care. Old
F~ort, Marcy, overldoking Santa Fe,
where Kearny built works in 1846, is
in fair tcoditi. n and ought to be pre

San Francisco, Jan. 16.-Among the
passengers on the steamer Newport
from Panama and way points were
Lieutenant Arthur H. Duttpn and J. J.
Many and four enlisted men of the
American manned Colombian cruiser
Bogota, which sailed from this port
Oct. 7. They speak in anything but
enthusiastic terms of their experiences
in Colombian waters. Lieutenant Dut
ton, who was executive officer of the
Bogota in a signed statement says:
"I never heard of a courtmartial
while I wasin Columbia. Punishment
was carried out and sentences inflicted
at the sweet will of those in power.
The so-called discipline of the armies
was maintained by the bullet or the
lash. Trifling offense at timbs was
punished by 500 lashes on the bare
back with a flexible cane. Men were
shot for mere nothing. A few days aft
er peace was declared twb Liberal of
ficers who refused to acquiesce in con
ditions, were captured and taken to
Chiqui fortress and there lashed bru
tally until dead. Some prisoners, who
had been taken after a particularly
stubborn resistance had their legs
or arms cut off or their eyes or ears
removed and were then released. to
go maimed through life. Some died
from the loss of blood. One of the sev
eral schooners loaded with refugees
which the Bogota was towing sprung
a leak in deep water at sea. The
refugees were rescued and the captain
and crew of five men were about to
follow them when the Colombiah offi
cer in charge ordered .them back on
board the doomed schooner. Let them
perish with her, he exclaimed.
"Six of the unfortunates, innocent
of. any wrong doing, were left to their
fate on the sinking schoorer, with no
sails and no boats."

RANGE QUESTION.
Resolltiion Thou'ght to ieP Acceptable to

Kansas City. Mo.. Jan. I.---At the
third day's session of the National
Livestock Association convention,
many papers were read and discussed,
and a flood of resolutions introduced
and considered.
An important resolution introduced
was one which sought to heal the long
standing bitterness existing between
cattle and sheep men over the questiOn
of ranges. A. F. Roherts:n of Texas
had Wednesday introduced a resolu
tion calling for an amendment to the
laws regulating grazing on public
lands and approving leasing of such
lands in states where such policy is
desired by the people. This was re
ferred to the executive committee and
finally laid upon the table. In its
place a substitute prepared by cattle
men and which, it is said, was ap
proved by sheepmen and by many cat
tlemen was indorsed. The resolution
says the laws governing the use of
public lands in the United States have
become obsolete owing to the rapid ad
vance of civilization, and that the
time has come for action by congress
in laws recognizing changed condi
tions, encouraging settlement and of
fering protection to settlers using
land for grazing purposes. The reso
lution endorses the suggestion of
President Roosevelt that a large area
of semi-arid lands be allowed for
homesteads and that commission ex
ports be appointed' to investigate the
preset atelsting eondition and sgrest
to congress just and fair reindl-.es
that will uaasttbhe growthoft the west.

AT A STANDSTILL.
Factories In East Chicago Have No Fuel

Chicago, Jan. 16.-Business in, East
Chicago, Ind., has been brought to a

The two plants consume 200 tons of
coal a day, and the supply ran short
last Saturday, when only one carload
of coal arrived. No fuel has been se
cured since.
