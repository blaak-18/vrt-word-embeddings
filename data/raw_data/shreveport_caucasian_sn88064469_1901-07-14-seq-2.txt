moral ntd material, of the aborigines
of this country. Much has already
been accomplished in this direction by
$iie devoted men and women who have
ftiosested themselves in tehait of the
-tsell brothers whose ancestors were
treasted none too humanely by our peo
ple in the earlier years, but there still
remains a vast amoudt of arduous and
wdit sacrificing work to be done before
'the nation's wards will cease to need
speelal care and guidance. The annual
'conferences of the Indian educators
w.ave been very helpful in carrying on
the work. Through them the Isolated
gelools scattered throughout the coun
try are molded into one connected
whole, and the disconnected and lade
peadent striving of each separate
cbhool is made of benefit to all the oth.
jars, and the whole bteomes an organ
' aed and harmonious movement to
the goal for which all are striv
n g.
The work of organizing and making
'preparations for the forthcoming con
gress has been under the supervision
4D f the national superintendent of In
dian schools. Miss Estelle Reel, to
whotn much credit Is due for the sue
ssful manner In which she has per
ormed this duty and the resulting
right prospects for the meeting. Miss
I is a woman of great ability and
educator of untional reputation. Un
ier her direction the Indian schools
'lave rapidly advanced in efficiency and
asefulness. The keynote of her plan
t f Indian education is self support, and
is will be the dominant note of all
the discussions of the congress. In
ber journeys through the Indian coun
4b she urges constantly upon the In
kilans the necessity for more and better
`arming, and her persistant endeavor
is to make the school course such as
IlW prepare the pupils to support them
selves as useful citizens In their re
tlye communities. Miss Reel Is
be first woman to hold the office of
tional superluten lent of Indian
pehools and seems admirably fitted for
work. She was appointed by Pres
eat McKinley in 1898. At that time
was superintendent of schools in
yoming. In discharging the duties
that office and In he. travels in the
t she had become familiar with the
adians and their educational netds.
bhe now has under her supervision
pmethlg over 500 Indian schools,
an attendance of about 00,000
pills.
Personally Miss Reel is a very charm
x young woman, with nothing man
about her. She has that most "ex
lent thing In a, woman." the low,
voice is conversation. She has
art of gowning herseif tastefully
stylishly. She has the due regard

seen at Pompeii and the museums of
Greece. Around the bottom of this ped

dn fro, at the age of 1t yentrs, young
shurehll reteivead an appointment to
the Naval academny at Annanpolis, and
he continued to serve as a ctdet until
shortly after his graduation in 189-1.
The training which he received at An
napolis was, of course, chiefly tech
nical, but It was nevertheless a good
trainlag% for the work he was subse
quently to undertake. Apart from the
advantage of being thrown with stu
dents from all parts of the country. the
hevere mental and physical discipline
to which he was subjected has given
him a power of concentration and a
habit of persistent work which ever
since have stood him fr good stead. At
the same time it made him realize that
pe could never be permanently satis
fied with anything but a literary life.
Much against the wishes and advice
of his relatives and friends, who had
pictured for him a brilliant career In
the navy. he resigned from the service
shortly after his graduation to accept a
position on The Army and Navy aour
nal. During his brief connection with
this publication he wrote his first story.
"Mr. Keegan's Elopement." which was
publo, Ihe Century Magazine.
He then became managing editor of
The Cosmopolitan Magazine, and after
a year of editorial work he decided to
devote himself to the writing of stories
and particularly of historical novels
dealing with American life. His first
book, "The CelebritiesC" published in
18e7, was indeed written In a vein of
very lively comedy, but "Richard Car
vel," upon which he was engaged for
several years, is the first of a series of
stories nl which Mr. Churchill proposes
to cover different phases of American
social development. "The Crisis" to the
second in the sertes and has for its
principal characters the descendants of
the dramatis personae of "Richard Car
tel."
"The Crisis," as everybody knows,
deals with the civil war period, and no
better theater could have been selected
for the exploitation of Mr. Churchill's
characters. It Is interesting to note in
this connection that the novelrsts,
north and south, are beginning to deal
freely with this period, and some of the
most enterta.Mitg and well constructed
novels of the past few years have tad
the civil war for their setting. Among
these might be mentioned Thomas Nel
son Page's "Red Rock," Morgan Bates'
"Martin Brook," John U'ri Lloyd's
"Stringtown on the Ptke," Henry Bor
land's "Passing of the Chevalier," Cap
tain F. A. Miltchel's "('hattanooga,"
"Chickamauga" and "Sweet Revenge.
It is withal significant as indicating
thsit the beat of that bitter conflict has
pa-sed, that the passions have died
away and that in a true perspective,
both of time and of feeling. the old dis
cussion can be treated frankly and dis
passionately. RICuARD TrrPRa.

many galloons and so many patterns
in plain nets that one can have a great
choice.
When I say plain nets. I mean all the
meshes that come under that head,
from brussels to ltussian fish net.
These are to be made over silk of the
same or contrasting color. Flouncings,
mostly of fine black ihantilly, will be
worn to an unheard of extent. Indeed,
the whole skirt will be covered with
lace flounces, sometimes all one width
and sometimes in graduated widths.
But the design is always the same.
The white and ecru laces will have
their sway, and the string and Arabian
point, as well as the point de venise
and bruges, will all be worn. In fact,
all kinds of lace will have more or less,
vogue. Even the veilings are to be used
for evening dresses, the very same
kinds as are now worn over the face
or on the hats. Some of the colors are
very raw and striking for veils, but
they now have fallen into the position
of hat trimming. Some of these ag
gressive colors are still further assert
ive with great white dots. Some of
them indeed have green golf sticks em
broidered on a red ground.
