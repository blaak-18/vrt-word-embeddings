(Written especially for the Jeffer
sonian, By Mr. Humphries, Mayor of
Hapeville.)
A DEAR LITTLE WOMAN.
“Oh, my!’’ said, a man as he opened
his mail
And found that it brought him the
bills for the sale
Os goods that his wife had purchased,
and he
Piled them up wondering what the 5 .?
sum wjyild be.
' Noting the balance that his check
book bore,
He thought to himself he’d always
be poor;
And said as he wrote, as though it
__ were lost,
“Oh, my! what a dear little woman
does cost! ’ ’
But after the toil and the trouble of
trade
In the business world where his
dollars were made,
This man each day througn a rose
wreathed gate
JWent home to the door where his
wife -did wait.
“And he counted it gain that they
could thus meet,
And his Labor for love—he counted
it sweet;
For away from his work, when the
streets grew dim,
She made home a picture of heaven
to him.

MISTAKEN IDEAS.
The world has some mistaken ideas
about women, and while it is not my
purpose to change the whole world’s
way of thinking, but merely wish to
call attention to some of these mis
conceptions. We all know that the
honor of being the most incessant
talkers has been conferred upon wo
men, "but she does not merit it for
I don’t believe that any three women
in Georgia could be gotten together
on a corner and stand there and talk
for tw T o hours, bur did you ever notice
a bunch of men, of three or even two
men get together on a corner and
talk and gesticulate until even the
children would stop in their games
to take notice, and talk and talk until
any woman would think that certainly
they would soon exhaust the subject
of their conversation, but no! they
never exhaust the theme or become
tired.
I have listened at them while their
patient wives were waiting and try
ing to keep supper hot and occassion
ally they would seem to break apart
or tear themselves away and one
would think that they were about to
disband, and the good wife would
warm over the supper and look again
and hear something like this: “Have
you seen the old big battle ships they
have got on the Savannah division?”
- “Well the old hogs they used to have
down there could sot pull as much.

down grade and had forty loads and
twenty empties and she broke loose
and I had to do some fine running to
keep the rear from hitting us, I
just pulled her wide open and let her
have all the steam she could stand
and I tell you, Bill, the telegraph poles
looked like teeth in a fine tooth
comb.” “Well how did you make
it?” “Oh, all right, my flagman Pete
is on to his job, when he heard the
broke loose signal, he just slapped the
brakes on and she slid a little but we
got her stopped before she hit.”

“What engine did you have?”
“The 1590, w r ell she is a daisy. I had
the valves set blind and she can get
over more ground than 1680 and runs
as smooth as n ribbon, the pops work
tine.”
“Well did you hear about old ‘Bo’
getting jerked up before the investi
gation committee for laying out ‘The
‘DIXIE FLYER’? ” “Yes, but they
can’t do nothing to him, he is in the
clear, he had the 1300 ! and she broke
an eccentric strap and side rod down,
he had to put her on one side and
get in the best he could. No danger
about old ‘Bo’ getting rolled, the

C. and the B. R. T. would get busy
and tie every turn table on the system
down before they would suffer it. ’ ’
“Well that was bad about Tim
getting put off for thirty days for
3effersoniait
ringing off a journal.” “Yes, and
all the Company’s fault. They know
that a fellow cannot make the sched
ule and do the work and get over the
road and keep the rules; they expect
him to take chances, and if he gets
a hot box he can’t take time to oil
or brass her.”
“Say that was bad about D. over
looking that order and running by
the ‘board.’ If old 12 had been on
time to the dot they would have had
a head-on collision sure.” “Yes, and
they say he is the most conservative
engineer on the road and for senior-
ity stands second.”
Well these are a few stray remarks
that a poor wife catches after warm
ing supper the third time and at last
she feels like going over to the corner
and looking up a piece of that
eccentric strap and getting to the
rear end or the cabosse and running
a “'Special” home Many wivs of
Railroad men will see familiar’ things
in this.
Now if the topic of conversation
should be politics or about municipal
elections, the wife can go in and give
the children their supper and put
them to bed and let the cook go (if
she is fortunate as to have one).
One word to the silent suffering
wives; don’t question the sincerity of
your husband when he stays out or
comes in late, for he has only met a
friend and got to talking.
Next week’s issue will have an
article by the same author, on the
mistaken ideas about women having
more vanity and curiosity than men,
so look out for it.

WHY DOES MRS. SMITH GET ON
MY NERVES?
By Annie Payson Call.
(In the Ladies’ Home Journal.)
If you want to know the true
answer to this question it is “because
you are unwilling that Mrs. Smith
should be herself.” You want her to
be just like you, or, if not just like
you, you want here to be just as you
would best like her.
1 have seen a woman so annoyed
that she could not eat her supper be
cause another woman ate sugar on
baked beans. When this woman told
me later what it was that had taken
away her appetite she added: “And
isn’t it absurd? Why shouldn’t Mrs.
Smith eat sugar on baked beans?
It does not hurt me. Ido not have
to taste the sugar on the beans; but
it is such an odd thing to do. It
seems to me such bad manners that
1 just get so mad I can’t eat!”
Now, could there be anything more
absurd than that? To see a woman
annoyed; to see her recognize that
she was uselessly and foolishly
annoyed, and yet to see that she
makes not the slightest effort to get
over her annoyance.
It is like the woman who discover
ed that she spoke aloud in church,
and was so surprised that she ex
claimed: “Why, I spoke out loud
in church!’’ and then, again sur
prised, she cried: “Why, I keep
speaking aloud in church!” —and it
did not occur to her to stop.
My friend would have refused an
invitation to supper, I truly believe,
it she had known that Mrs. Smith
would be there and her hostess
would have baked beans. She was
really a slave io Mrs. Smith’s way
of eating baked beans.
“Well, I do not blame her.” I hear
some reader say; “it is entirely out
of place to eat sugar on baked beans.
Why shouldn’t she be annoyed?”
I answer: “Why should she be
annoyed? Will her annoyance stop
Mrs. Smith’s eating sugar on baked
beans? Will she in any way—
selfish or otherwise —be the gainer
for her annoyance? Furthermore, if
it were the custom to eat sugar on
baked beans, as it is the custom 1 to
put sugar in coffee, this woman
would not have been annoyed at all.
It was simply the fact of seeing Mrs.
Smith digress from the ordinary
course of life that annoyed her.”
There are two ways in which people
get on our nerves. The first way lies
in their difference from us in habit
in little things and in big things;
their habits are not our habits. Their
habits may be all right, and our
habits may be all right, but they are
“different.” Why should w.e not be
