[. O. Democrat, April 10th ]
Tihe argument in the lottery ease
was concludedl in Billings' comit
Wednesday. Tihose. J. Seames open- n
ed tle case Monday for the lottery- ;
the Attorney General and AsIsItant
Attorney General replied, and Judge d
John A. Campbell, for the Lottery a
Company, closed the following day. t
Perhaps any speech-mnaklaoo either f
side was annecseary. There is s
scarcely a man in the State who 11
knows anything about Judge Billings'
relations with the Lottery Company '
who is not fully convinced that, right a
or wrong, argument or no argument a
law or no law, he will decide aan ad t
all questions whieb may arie lao his t
court affecting the Lottery Company I
as that institution may dictate. From I
the moment we learned that the com.
pany and its attorneys had the au- J
daeity to utterl ignore the State I
courts and apply directly to the I
United States Circuit Court for a i. in
junction to prevent the execution of a t
criminal statute of the State, to the I
moment John A. Campbell closed bhis I
argument, or until this hour, we have a
never doubted that Billings would <
stand by the company.
For some years past the tendency 1
of the Federal judiciary has been to
usurp the jurisdiction of the State
courts, and more has been done I
through the subtle and insidious de- '
pisions of the courts to destroy the I
rights of the people and the States r
than was accomplished by carpet.
Imggery, the usurpations of theority t
by Grant and the army which be ca. t
trolled regardless of law or justlce.
Indeed, the eeotralisationists have I
found a peans of dostroying civil f
liberty, concentrating power and up- I
holding the oppressive privileges of (
the few, more potent than the layo. t
nets of Cesar or Napoleon; and un.
der the insidious forms of law and '
the pernicious decisions of the courts, I
the character of the government is I
being destroyed and the oligarchy of l
the money power strengthened and
established. And no Federal eourt I
has been so reekless and unscrupulous
in its eneroachmmnts upon the jari.- e
dietion of the State courts and the l
rights and funcetions of the State gov. I
ernment as the United States Court I
for the District of Louisiana. We 4
have not forgotten, and the heart of
every Louisianian burns with indig- 4
nation at the recollection of the fact
that, in 1873, the whole State gov I'
ernment of Louisiana was overturna
ed amd an odious and infamous usr- I
pation set up bIy an order signed at I
midnight by a drunken judge of that I
cotl; and that the present judge of I
the same coast was present at the I
consumation of the crime: that lie l
was the partisan and attorney of thl I
usurpation and the chief instigator of
that judicial outrage which must, so
long as men love honer, justice and I
liberty, remain a stain, black as hell, I
upon the Federal judiciary. The r
men who were Iarties to that cr imne, i
however exalted the official positions I
they may reach, can never escape I
from the cloud of infamy in which it
has enshrouded them and all their
acts. More recently we have seen
our fellowaeitizens, Ly thle hundred,
-in the name of the United States
literally laid hold of by tim United I
States marshal, dragged from their I
ihopes andt brought before the Fede I
rareoullt in this eity for doing what, I

tli athe the Vbtek eaeu;
aio of the Louisiana courts. But th e
Attorney General of Virginia did rot :
rest the can there. He. lis gone into I
the Supreme Court of the United
States to teat the question whether or
not theme subordinate Federal courtse
can administer the criminal laws of i
Virginia. When Billings renders his
decision in the Lottery can we have
no doubt that our eown able and pa
triotie Attorney General, who has
fought the usurpations so well and
nobly, will carry the essue into the
highest tribunal of the Republic. "
But in the meantime vigorous
measures should be taken by our
other State and city omcials and by
our members of Congress to rebakei
the action of Billings and put oan end
toa these dangerous usurpations of the
Federal jadiciry. Gov. Nicholls I
should issue a ringing protest against
the scandalous action of the lottery
judge in suspending a high criminal
law of this State. The chief of po.
lie of this city, and the coarts of the
s-y and State which have juriediet
ties of thil crime, should ignore the
injunction of Billings, and under the
protection of the Governor and the
mayor, and of the militia if necessarY
enforce the law to a trial in the high
eat court tht es Juriediction of it. L
In suchb a cae time Lottery Company
will have an opportunity to seek the
United States Supreme Court by a
writ of error, while in the meantime
a criminal law enacted by the Legis
lature of the State, on the demand of
nine-tenths of the people, and signed I
after long and mature deliberation of
the Governor, will be enforced, and
the dignity of the State sustained.
In this matter our repreentatives
i Congrews also have a duty to per
form. When Billings ventures, at
the dictation of Hessrs. Semmes and
Campbell, the attorneys of the Lot
tery monopoly, to usurp time funetions
of our State courts and suspend the
operation of our criminal laws,
Messrs. Ellis,. Gibson, Robertson,
Elam, King and Acklen should take
active steps to have him impeached.
Washington, Madison, Jefferson,
Webster and Calhoun, could they re
visit the earth and witness the pro.
ceedings in Billings' or Dives' court,
would shrank with horror freom the
speetarile and spurn with contempt
tihe degenerate people who submit
quietly to subch judicial outrages.
The Democrats in Congress have
done nobly so far in their eforts to
enforce the repeal of obnoxious Fede
ral election laws, and we trust that
on that imase they will defeat dth
oentralimationists. Bat ear chief dal.
ger, sad Mr. Jefferson divined it him
self, is in tihe encroachments of the
Yederal judiciary. Let this blch of
tihe Federal government also be at
tcked; let the Ire open all along
the line; let the insolent judges,
whether here or in Virginia, or else
where, who invade tim jurisdiction of i
the State courts, be impeached at tihe
bar of the Senate and their erimes
against civil liberty exposed to the
country, even if there be not patri
ots enough in that braclh of tim Con, 4
grees to convict amd degrade thenm.

Hitherto Unpmished. wi
ye
At a recent meeting of the Penn
sylvania Historical Society, its seere
tery, William Brooke Rawle, read a
letter presented to the society by R. e
Gilmor of Baltimore from General r
Hery Lee, Jr., Jr., better known as
"Lightbhons Harry," to his relative
Thomaes Lee, then a judge in South wi
Carolina, relative, to the captore of
Andre and treason of Arnold. The fr
following is a verbatim copy of the
eprductlon, and has never before been
published. A throwing light on an fri
important historbal incident, from 12
an ofliclt source, it will doubtless tbe
froned very interesting. "Light-horse d
Harry" Lee was the fathor of the W
late Robert E. Lee of the Confederate Be
army, and died in Baltimore, in 1816, e
from the elects of inljries received fri
at the hands of a moot. Following is AL
the letter :

eod two events which will bear a dis- "
tingeuihed lnstre in the annals of He

and estranged his friend, Major An- in
dre. This latter matter was, perhapes, f
un aavoidable though it is pgerally at- .e
tributable to a peilanuimety inherent
i in the villain's breast. As if deter
mined to exhibit to the world how
deep in infamy human nature is ca
pable of descending, he is now, by
violations with the coumnander-in
chief, pointing out to Sir Henry Clin
too those characters in the city of
New York friendly to the American de
cause. He lives, but le lives to th
misery and anguish. Tihe virtuous
Andre is dead, but dead with honor. th

was the ocer in his measures that

of the eptre othe spy to Mr. Ar- 1
- nold, and, conseqaently, furnithed I:
y Arnold, with time to escape. This 7l
It was erroneous, not itentional. Ar. "
nold made the best use of this notice, p
and got to the Vulture in his barnse
s under the sanctity of a dag. The 4
; poor bargemen whom he had adse t
I use on this occasion were, at his
instance, retained as prisoners of di
war. Andre and Smith were brought If
to camp for trial. The former was *l
eondemned, the latter is still under w
trial. The virtuous Andre, though di
It conscious of having become a spy m
without intention and by accident, hi
yet, in aletter which be wrote to has ah
general, he approve the propriety of 8
S sentence. Time was give for
preparation on behalf of the unfore i
ttoate Andre. General Robertson l
Scae to our advaesat with some Ie
I triliong request, and brought his v- t
Slians to prove to Genal Washing. B
Slogos that Andre was no spy, not-. t
l withetanding Andre's letter to to he w
Scontrary. In. conseqaene of this Si
m overture from the enemy,
THE EXECUTION WAS POSTPONED
from Sunday 5 o'cloek, to MondayT
S12. Nothing further was offered by
the enemy, and the eminent youth
died ender a gallows. This olicer
was the particlar favorite of his
general, and tie most promising gen.
erl la the army. How cold are the I
' friendships of men high in Power. E
i; Andre's death's does honor to human el
natare. Fer my part, I declare titp
.I would rather be Andre than dbe

of Henry Clinton's declarations since li
