Willie was iust attaining man

After a few days illness he suc

his devoted family.
The funeral took place from the
residence of his father, Mr. S.
Nelken, on Wednesday, and was
well attended by friends and rela

Populist Ticket In W'eblter.
On last Tuesday the Populists of
Webster parish in convention at
Minden nominated the following
parish ticket, which is conceded to
be a strong one: For Sheriff, A.
A. Miller, Clerk, T. T. Lowe,
Legislature, W. NM. McBride, ('or
oner, Dr. T. J. Tabor. stcps were
taken looking to the early estab
lishment of a Populist pallor at
Minden, which if done, will insure
the election of the ticket.

writes a girl. "anl instead of re
ccivcing con;gratulations I atn aware
that I need a defense, and take
this means of making it. I :mu
i 2 years old--old enough to know
ibetter and do better, but I have no
choice. The man is a widower
with'one child. He liked his first
wife better than he does me. I
liked a nman years ago better than
I like him, so we are quits on that.
He wants a housekeeper. I want
a home. I was brought up to sing
a little and play a little, but have
no trade. My parents will be glad
to see me settled. I would be
happier earning $5 or Sn a week
and taking care of myself, but I
was not taught how. There are
thousands of women in my losi
tion. Every nman who brings up
his daughters without starting
thenm with the means of ea fning a:
livelihood is responsible for just
such a mistake as I shall make next
month."-('rowley Signal.
DIED.
In loving remembrance of JAMFEs
H. McKNSGIIT, who departed this
life on Friday, October 11th, 18~5i :
aged 43 years.
A bright light has faded, 'andl
where once its radiance was shed
darkpeess reigns supreme. Death
hai mvaded our midst and in an
swer to his imperative summons:
friend McKnight went to meet his
maker, ad to dwell in that fair
bad of light and love.
Poor friend, words are unable
to express the ornrow of the writer
at thy absence. My tears, my
sympathies are with thy family to
console them in their sorrow and
despair, and while I know thou art
under the sheltering wings of the
angebi, I would fain have had thy
stay on earth a little longer. On
the suppliant knee I ask the Lord
to comfort and care for thy family
in their sorrow and distress, and
in my heart, full with loving
thoughts of thee, these words are
echoed: "G(d be with you till
we meet again."
A FRIENDI
Natchitoches, La., Oct. 14th.
At his home on Cane river, Oct.
6th 1895, Mr. Fzawx WALtRS
a aside his armor and entered
the heavenly rest; aged 24 years.
This young man was sick only
threedays, and his sudden death
was truly distressing.
Again we come with bowed heads
and saddened hearts, for death has
again invaded our ranks and taken
from as one of our brightest and
beat boys.
The master's ways are not our
ways, but we can say from over
fowing hearts, "Thy will be done."
The master called, ad he was
ready.
'Servaat ol God, well does,
Beat ero thy loved eapleoy.,
The battle's lougbt the vitoryr's worn;
Eater thy mster's joy."
