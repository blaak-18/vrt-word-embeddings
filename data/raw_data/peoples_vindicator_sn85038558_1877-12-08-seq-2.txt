If we nu derstan the Gover'nor
correctly, he is in favor of shelectingt
of aill men in the State w ithout re
aences. Il other Woids, the worthy Go.
gavlte r ias beeand so carried aitay withr
politicahe pece er" that ll ingines het
has dropped down into the Govt-) nor s
chair of the Sttye of Louiisi own-a parin the
ofidst of therl loe nilniuver wlich we
arel-hold will precede the end of the
world. Stripping this short spieech of
all verbiage, we find the Governor,
nominated by a pol, itical party, voted
for solidly and only by a political or.
ganization, and sstaine thetus far by
political "organs," endeavoring to
build up a party of his own-a party
of brotherly love and universal af
fia ion. A parn fty that will support
no paper that denounces crimes bly
their right names, but athlled f r those
danipy of anlcy sheets that will, hliee
an o ricial thief is angiht, "assuage
all diffetences," ald hel "ind ividual
conflicts."
Ifa condition of afthirs existed in
Louisiana which called for such a
display of mercy, people might see
some reason for this language, but
when we find all the virtue amd in
telligence in the State arrayed in a
solid body against corrupition and
crime backed by ignorance and bnru
tality, it is time that the "sentiment"
indulged in to such an extent as we
note, sihoul be il nuqired into by aillI
"good people." This itlquiry should,
and will extend to the ploloer under
standing of how its practical effect
will injure the "common welfare."
We are well aware that the present
administration has not reflected by
its acts the views of the Democratic
party that elected it-that it has in
fact had the siiltuppor otf ibt a beg
gerly minority of the white people,
and Ihas so far been ablte to nlove
along without protest, simply be
cause the people, although bitterly
hostile to tihe manner of conducti|ig
tihe State government, were willing
to allow its head the pleca of an hon
est intention to do right. They hald,
in other words, confidence in the mo
tives of the Governor, but were
fontded in thie belief that his idleas
were as harmless as they were im
practicable; and they were willing
to indulge himn so loig as there was
no shown te(tdegey to disintegrate
the people, the party and the ideas
for which they conlendetd.
We most iunhlesitatingly say that,
the point demanuding a plrotest on the
part of the people, who, by their vir
tine, valor and unbendinig idelity to
principle, placred Governior Nicholls
and his adminiiiistratinn in office,
against a policy ihiicll now uncovers
itselt to the extent of an attempt to
destroy their orgauization, Ihas been
reached.
Sentimentalists and dreamrers may
talk of a destruction of political par
ties, and slineer at political ideas, but
so hOng as repl)resentative government
exists, just so lung will theore be po
litical parties struggling for political
supremacy. In this country to day,
(as there has been from the founda
tion of tihe government) there is a
party for the people, their rights
and liberties, and one against theni
contending for centralization and for
spoils. The party of peace, of liber
ty of the people is the Demiocratic
party-a party which represents in
tlia State, not only what we hare
enumerated, but also tile virtue and
civilization of tihe saxon race. There
is not a tenet of this organizatioit to
which an Ihonost men can take an ex
ception, and to attempt its disintegra
tion, now that it has given freedomi to
an aenalaved people, were a erime of
the most revolitng clatacter.
But soDnse will say, "wVhat has the
ftct of retaining a political organ-of
supporting it by the patronage of the
people, got to do with the iparty, anid
how is that an attempt to destroy
the organization ?" The New Or
leans Democrat is the head and front
of the Demuocratic organization in
this State. Its Editor has the affec
tion, esteem and conifidence of every ]
manu, womani and childt in the organi- s
zation. It is looked to for help and i
tor opinionsb ; to strilte it down is to
nilrder the party. We ask in all

Principles are the Gods, men but
worshipers. C'anute tried hii eour

bhit a momentr of his position, and he
will yield fealty to the Gods.
The New Orleans Picarune (Friday
Nov. 30(th) has an article on "patty
governlICmenut" that should have been
labeled a "lecture to the Governor."
The Pic contends that a laIge ele
niet, not Democrats, elected the
present State :administration, and
insists that it sho'uld be conducted so
as to give this element, "not Demo
crats," a chance at tihe flesh pots.
This pleasant fiction of a aIrge
clemient "not I)enlocrats voting the
Democrlatic ticket and thercby elect
ing their nominees to ollice, has been
going the rounds of the press, that
press of the Pie's sort, for snlle time,
and it is a fiction of the basest kind.
We venture the prediction that not
live hundred men in the whole State
"nuot Democrats" voted for Governor
Nicholls.
We' would not insult a white Lon
isionian by inferring even, that he
could look on at the plunder of his
people--the muirder of his race, andl
the degradation of his virtue and
civilization, and not lie a Deimocrat
and one too, as Bourbon and violent
as the nature of the case deman;ltded.
People (,otside of Louisiana should
recognize the fact that the most of
the New Orleans jominals are as igno
rant of public sentiment, in the coun
try parishes of their own'r State, as
the King of I)ahoiny. And furthet;
that ithese samiie journals (io not. coll
trol a sing.le man in the country par
ishls. Their editorils aind opinions
have no weight, and receive no at
tention. We state theso as facts
which cannot be gainsayed. There.
fore it is perfectly useless to sutppose
thoise city papers that talk of a large
element "not I)Democrats" who never
theless support Demlocrlatic nomiinees
exist inl this State, know what they
are talking about. It is simply the
airey exhlalation of the brain; but the
baseless fabric of a vision.
When we hear and read of people
making such a bhal assertion as
"that the present General Assembly
contains all the eminent and able
Democrats in the State," we are
forceahly struck with the poverty of
intellect abounding in the party to
which we have the honor to yield
allegiance. A Sahara of brains, as it
were, seems to exist in that enlight
ened body, which we could well bear
with, if that august gathering did not
possess at the same time an arctic
sterility of common sense.
The Constitutional Convention will
be the issue at the next meeting of
the General Assembly-and nothing
else will satisfy our people.
Speaker Bush, is reported as op
posed to party organizations. He
belongs to the "able men" Louisiana
has in her General Assembly.
The very best family weekly paper
in America, to our idea, is the Detroit
Free Press. Every one shares our
opinion, and the more they read it the
more they want to. The yearly sub.
scription price is $2 and it should be
taken in every family in Louisiana.
Without wishing to seem disrespect
ful or flippant, we would ask that the
Hayes Deluoerats in Louisiana should
pull down their vests.
Stanley Matthews was to have been
depended upon to "stand by the Pre
sideut"-it seems the stand by wasn't
very heftv.
State Taxation.
Complaint is universal of high tax
es, and this COml jilainit is just.
We can brielly suggest how it can
he reduced.
First-'There munnst be a Constitu
tional Convention, herause the henv
i('st buirden's resting ulpon us flow
firom the present instruoment.
Secondly--lhen that C(onvention
asse'llbles, besides thle reduction ofI
s;ialirie's, the follnu ing oflie's should
be abolished : Lieut. (Governor, Snt
plinteident of Pilit' Edueation and
Secretlary of State, Parish Judges.
T'x ('ollectors and Assessors. The
S preine (''nit made 4one of lasw nid
r'edneed to tllhlee membhers. Sahivts,
+3.00l per annium for the njpretne
.Julge and "l.,0t0) for each of the as
sociates. District judiges not Ito ex
Ceed twelve in the State. Tenure of

luanch of' governm entt thiich can le
shoul he localized. Pnhlic schools.
&c., to revert to parish control as to
conduct and taxation. A $%50 poll
tax before you can vote, that tax to
go to the support of iublic schiools.
And thirdly n new mode of raising
it revenue must be devised. To this
ncud we < oihl suggest the introdue
tion of the Molli t register. For a
levee tax and to pay interest on levee
bhiids, let each hale of cotton grown,
gathered or packed in pairishes re
'quiring or having had protection by
levees, lpay a tax of -3; each larrel
of lice $1, a;d each Ihugshead of sugar
I'nless there lie such sweeping
changes as w vehave eoumerated, then
the property owner will let his prop
etty sell t hen lie can take the benefit
of the twoyears allowed by the present
law and redeem it in better times,
while the State governmeunt in the
mean time would go to the dogs,
Now. "Kellogg, the scoundrel, vil
lain, thief, fraud, a-hum, hum, has by
tlie vote of a vile partizan Senate
usurped a seat therein, to nhlich he
has not the shadow of a title."
(Indignant utterance of fMr. Buzfuz
in a late uumber of the Weekly Con
ciliator.)
'Twelve months hence. Gentlemen
of the General Assembly, (90 per cent
l)emociats.) I have the honor', ah,
of introdncing to you our Sei u tr,
WVin. Pitt Kellhgg. Alt~Gigh
having been charged with many
things diflfering in sentiment (?) from
o hat the "viohlents" (anit the bible)
thinlk right ; having failed to account
in a great measure for the 4 rge
almount of funds which the taxpayers
of Louisiana are shoit, still gentle
men, I have no hesitancy in anying
that Goveinor Kellogg has totally
and wholly reforled, and his heart
heats warmly for his native land ; as
witness, gentlemen, is vote on t'e
bill appropriating $500,O)0 to "full ap
l''one's bayou;" his efTfirts8 i Iiicl 4e
caled the adoption of the new s5o(iid
ing pole for Eads Jetties; whereby, to
get at 20 feet solid water, we dl ive
the pole four fiet in the mnud, and
conin t le top gunwale of the yawl
tlie watr line, thele by, genitleinen,
seculring the holpe of the grain trade
of the West. Look at his vote on
Tom Scott's railroadl bill, gentlemien,
and then let thlie ''"Bibois" dare de
ny that Governor Kellogg is not abusi
ed wrongfully and shamefully.
Yells, and cries of Bully; where
upon somebody moves a vote of
thanks to the able and latriotic Sen
ator (?) Kellogg, and all go'rilnd the
corner to smile-at thl nice way they
have of pulling the wool over the
eyes of the blasted rural rustics.
All this is "iassuaging political dif
ferences" and "healing individual
wonllds."
Sixteenth Psalm.-S. 1M.
"Rise, sinners rise, &c."
Brother Buzfuz of tine Conciliator
will please lead the tune.
HTas the senting of Kellogg got any
thing to do with that bar'gain. Some
body speak P. 1). Q.
Louisiana is represented or not rep
resented in the Senate by the gentle
man (!) from Illinois, Kellogg. The
gentleman from Tennessee, Spofford,
has our most heartfelt sympathy.
He sticks his head out of his warm
nest -does the democratic official, and
wants to know bega;d, what the d-1
people wanit with a new Constitution
As -,ur friend Potts of the Mansfield
Reporter says: "It's remarkable what
a large amount of good some people
suddenly found in the damned radical
Constitution any way."
David Davis, the ludependent nnm
skull from Illinois, sat in his easy
chair in the Senate when the vote on
Spoflord and Kellogg took place and
kept his mouth shut. He expressed
himself grieved over the rape of Lou
isiana. Still he sat there, a monu
ment of obesity, and the galleries
could'nt tell where the perspiration
euded and the tears began.
Louisianians, when you hear a man
say ho is an Independent, put him
down as a radical. If they don't vote
that w~ay they decline to say "aye."
