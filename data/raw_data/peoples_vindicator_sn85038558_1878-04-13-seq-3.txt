while ill colmmtand inll New Orleans. Heo
was Nicholls' classmate and friend ait a
o West Point, and the friendly relati'uts
then established hall been iaiutatted is
sine the war. Why not get Ilhaneock to at
io to New Orleans and see what could be of

' 'his line of reasoning induced the Pre- H
10 sident to send an otlieer of the army of
high rank to New York to see Ilancock.
and induce him to accept the unsolderlly "i
1 task. here began the expense t to the Go- I
vernment in carrylng out this intrigue. ti'
for, as usual when mnilitary officers are tc
n sent ott duty to one pist to another, their at
in mileage is paid by the Quartermaster's r
'h l)Department. This messenger, notwith- a
standing his hiigh rank, had some diliicul
Sty in persuading the great Democratic
e' military chieftain to aecept tlhe task.
of IIancock had very little taste for the job.
r He had known the President in the army
when he commanded a division in Han
cock's cock's corps. Finally General Hancock w
ks concluded to go. iut, only to serve his old \
d visionll cotnia; dr, iwho was now in l
great straits. He arrived in New Orleans
al- nti th ' Sth of February. The freedom of
Ils the city was oth'red to him. Gentlemen a
in. the most irominent in the State vied l
with each other in their attentions. His 1
n visit wa a mgnifictient ontlurst of the ti
r l, appreiation of the Democracy of Louisi- n
i ata of the man who, as they declared,l ,
"st combined the splendid courage of the tl
soldier with regard for right andu wrong o
le of the statesman." He called on Gover
lit nor Nicholls Tnesday evening, February
of 19th, ,ndil cautiously broached the matter
.of the intrigue. In answer to the ques- I
tion as to what he meant to do about n
e Anderson, Governor Nicholls said he re
ally did not know, that a motion for a
Ihe new trial for Anderson, which was ex- .
ts, peeted on that day (Tuesday. 19th), had
been postponed by ,Jude Whittaker un
tilTnesday, February 26th. On orl about I
Wm Wednesday, Februry, 20th, Colonel
no- Tourtellotet of General Shirman's staff,
arrived in New Orleans as the bearer of
h confidential dispatches from President t
SHayes to Hancock. The ceremoni'ls at
he tenidant upon the death of the Ptpe,
on .which were conducteld Wednesdaty, Feb
['m rnary 20th, and the parade and review of
the State Guard on Friday, Felbruary 22,
so oecnpiedl the Governior's attention that
rds he could not give the matter of Ander
ilt- son's pardon InIichi consideration ; andt it
Swas not until Friday evening. March 1st,
that Nicholls Ji, ally aoreed to pardon Ander
son, if the S:premne Court did not liber
b- ate him. Although his mission was ac
ast. complisheld, HanIcock tarried in New Or
leans nntil March 3d; Iunt in the mean
to time Colonel Tourtellote had retnrned to
hot Washington, and the President had re
>le s ceived information of the success of his
d intrigues. Whether he snhAbsequently
compimented Haneock for the delicate
- manner in which he handled his unmili
the tary duty is not known; bnt tbe release
had of Anderson by the State Supreme Court
has relieved all parties to the affair, es
pecially Governor Nicholls from much

[New Yik 31, r ry .]j
;overlt r" I iee, of 11:isschusetts,
has signalizedll his administration by
one of the most dailing and lunillshi
ig acnts ave perplletralted ; gaiist lthe
lighits of poor meni, w id , i1s and t
lophans. That such a hill as that
hioneyedly called" Au net for the bet- i
telr Irltcetion of deposito.rs in savings i
hanks" wias deliberatelyv pissed by C
the .tLegisliture, ar d signed by the
Governor of the O(l lBay State, showis b
that the CoImli onwealth of Hancllck, e
Otis and Adams has gone into an t
eclipse of disgrace and dislhonlor. This
nefarious la actuially locks tip the I
Shard earnings of the poor mlelihailics i
and laborertts andl number of helpless a
e widows and minors in the rotten sa
tvi ings bankls of the State, and is to i
ollntinue ini full force and effect forl
three years to collie. It is a stay
law which grants to thle depositor the
bare privilege of drawing but ten per
cent. of the full aniount of his bank i
r account. The depositor is at the (
miercy of ai set of commiissionels, who
are ostensibly his legal fl iends, but a
really his despots, for they can limit
or regulate the tl pittance which is per- (
m- itted to draw ; and his appeal from C
Ssuch deslpotisml is t the Surenme
Civil Cour t, should lie feel himself
e aggrieved. 'hi latter isl adding in- I
sult to injury ; for how is it possible
e for a depositor to employ counsel iand
run the risk of payinlg costs of suit,
I with his money in the hands of the
officers of saving banks ? The law is
a premium on scol ndrelismi. While
the poor depositor is denied the right
to draw his money from the banks in
such sllns as may be required for his I
wants, te offllicers can make such in
vestments as they please and revel in
luxurious salaries, and enjoy all the
Sease, comfort and elegance o(f princes.
1 There is no question of the uncon
- stitultitonality of such a law. Every
r. State Constitution has engrafted upon
g it that clause in the Federal Consti
e tution prohibiting legislatures from
11 passing any law "Impairing the obli
- gation of contracts. The contlact be
l tween the banks and their depositors
t in special, and can not he anulled by
- law-makers. But what depositor will
st be able to test the constitutionality of
the ant to which Governor Rice has
il atixed his signatulre It looks as if
t, Massachusetts had at last torn from
lher Pltritan face the mask of honor
n tad gone regularly into the business"
of higlhway robbery. No State has
een llmore blatant about "repudia
lion," and yet she is the first to re
Spudiate ianl honest contract in which
the we!fare and future prospeiity of
' lier poor men and women are 1o11nd
c- up, and to become the champion of a
lie systemn of rotten banking and peerless
a roguery that have no parallel outside
oa- f her penitentiary. Her sister States
le should be warned by her example, or
else there will come a time when the
gallows of Ilaman may be a whole
some public institution.
Digest This.
We trust our friend Hewitt will
pardon us for calling his attention to
the following excellent criticism from
his excellent paper of a late date.
We enldose every word Ihe says, but
the remarks are nevertheless very
heavy on the Supreme Court:
These nice points may be all very
clear to minds well versed in legal
lore, but it looks like a confused mass
of inconsistency, savoring of corrup
tion, to the great mass of the peoplle,
who can only see that a great out
rage has been committed, and that
the perpetiators are left unpunished.
Nothing but the unblemished charac
ter, exalted social standing, and high
reputation as men of honor and learn
ing, of the gentleman who compose
our Supreme Court, restrains the
people from such an outburst of in
dignation as was never before wit
nessed in this State.
They Continue to Kick Him.

Mr. Tilden's run of ill-luck con
tinues. First the Pry sdency was
stolen from him, then his library,
thien his overcoat, and now the Courts
have rendered judgment against him
in the celebrated Income-tax case. A
jury will now determine the amount
of income upon which he will be re
quired to pay, but the case wilt ulti
mately go to the Supreme Court and
some of us may never live to hear
the last of it.
John Young, the inventor of the
clothes-wringer, died recently at
Amsterdam, N. Y., in comparative
poverty. He once sold a conditional
right to a Boston firm for $5,000 when
he might have realizsed $100,000.
