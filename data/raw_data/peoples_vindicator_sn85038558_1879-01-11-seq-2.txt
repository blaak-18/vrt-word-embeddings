These Arguments.
The New Orleans Desocrat tells as Ke
that the enemies of popular liberty fitI'
in Louisiana, who have been disguis- terta
ed as Democrats, are yet for all we Oi
know to the contrary, and are busy Dece
with tihe same stale, insidious arg-- unab
ments they used last year to defeat a O0 tI
Constitutional Convention. TI
Those arguments are; "no politi- arril
cal agitation-the country wants
peace-we might not be able to carry TI
the State- -you couldn't elect men ed S
with suaiient ability to insure a good of L
Constitution--it will cost too much- of tI
Haype might not like it-what will lean
the Northern people say-Nicholls Hon
might he tinned out of ofi~ce-the
debt of the State might be repudiat- sum
ed-the Bourboos might play hell"- olut
and so on to the end of the chapter. held
The real reasonos these men enter-. re
tain, which they cloak beneath an C
assumed patriotism, are; fear of a enti
cheap government-that they might drib
be turned out of oiice-that monop- snal
olies will be swept away-that every viol
useless and cumbersome office wonld spe;
be abolished, and finally, that real Ilen
reform would be inaugurated, and as
their pickings and stealings stopped. pub

The Nqw Orleass Demomrat, Slt ion
December, charges' the Printing Board con
with endorsing the Lottery's attempt b
-to malign Mr. Dupre, the State Prin- eral
-ter; and with an effort to give the vote
I State Printing to some other paper, the
whether Mr. Dnpre's bid was the urn,
't lowest or not. The proof adduced to t
1 to sustain the charge of maligning is, gra
-we think, ample. We will publish it per

a of the Printing Board to give the her

per, Democrat or Republican, we fro
t, simply append what the Governor and
I himself said at a meeting of the wl
Printing Board, Januamy 3S, 1879:
a (Itallics oars.)
Gov. Nicholls-We have a duty to 1
perform, and we most close out the wit
contract and bring the parties to test. dec
t When the bid eame up for considers- wel
Stieon I was not inclined to acceept it, ma
It because the price was so loe; but as ,ne
the ,secnrities were believed to be 1
Sgod I could not object. However, I tio
eb canet believe that the contract can we
be carried out, unless the enotractinn, wa
is parties are moire- wealthy than I ime
think, a
The Printing Board calls for bids tlh
for the public printing, and proclaims
to thi world that the lowest bidder
shallt it--and ia the face of this, dil
the aovernor, a member of that lin
Board, and who voted for the lowest thi
tll
bid construetion, declares lie was not shi
Sinclined to accept the bid because itits
was "tefa low."

publican by over 2000 majority, but and
the Democrats openly took the elec- A

I companies were organized and ap- to. S
t geared under arms. At one pieeinct,
where 256 Republican and no Demo
eratic votes were cast, the box, list of A
0 voters, etc., were forcibly taken from thei
the commissioners by a large body of feat
armed men. The laws of the state ture
and of the United States with regard It
to the conduct of elections were fla- wer
b grantly violated. United States an- and
t pervisots were not permitted to do frIl
their duties, and Republican voters ple
were driven from the polls. :ve

that they should certainly be killed I)
should they ever again dare to enter Ha

This parish Is and has always been *mt

ia,'1 Jll.y 'r Ieill in this sectionl of (
the State where he has resided for
many yeirs. who will regret to learn
of his demise. The New Orleans
Times of the 1st, after mentioning the h
death of Capt. Packette says: "Ills e.
first venture, we believe, was the
Lucy Robinson, then the W. M. ºi
Levy and others. The last boat he
was on was the rapides; since then
hle has filled some public offices in
the parish to which lie belonged.
We sympathize with his family in
the loss they have met with, and si
lenldy drop a t his memory."
We infer from the following taken
from the New Orleans Democrat of
the 31st, that this committee will vis
I, it this parish at an early day:
Yesterday smonaing' Senator J. B.
t Eustis telegraphed Senator. A. H.
I Garland requesting him, if possible,
i to secure authority for the Blame
- sub-committee tj visit the parishes,
n the object lwing to prevent the pack
ing of witlie+ses.
Last eveningi Senator Enutis re
a ceived the following reply which ex
i- plains itself:
I- "Leave for New Orleans Thursday
y night. 'rue authority. 4 ill be con
u ferred.
.n A. I. GARLANS."
id The commnittee which will visit this
city, will be. ecom!posed of Messrs.
- Teller, Kirkwood, Cameron, Bailey
it and iastland.
- After csnmpleting their labors in
y this State the conlmittee will proceed
- to South Carolina.
n" The Shreveport Times says.
of As might have been anticipated,
m there will he a strong effort to de
af feat the call by the present legisla
te tare for a coinstiitionaIl convention.
d It is claimed that the amendments
-. were adopted at the recent election
i- and the N. 0. Times argues there
o fromn that, the sentiment of the peo
ra ple of the state is opposed to a con
vention. Whether the count will
al show that a mnajority of votes were in
a- favor of the amendmentls or not, we
a, are: perfectly well satisfied that a
u, majority of the people of the state
as are in favor of a convention. No
t, doubt but many p.ersons voted for the
to anendments simply because they
ot were oa.thle ticket and without re
v fleeting that their adoption would
mr militate against time call of a conven
tion--in other words, give a pretext
sy to opposing it.
