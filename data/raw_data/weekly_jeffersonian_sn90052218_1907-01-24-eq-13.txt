a furrow with his royal hands,, fol
lowing the plow along the furrow with
his royal feet. Sometimes, it seems to
me, that this country, this republic,
would be. entirely better off if those
who now follow the plow, not one day
in the year but all the work days of the
work season of the year, should deter
mine that they will mount from the
furrow and step upward to the throne.
They can do it, if they will. They
must do it if they are not willing to al
ways be the servitors and subjects of
those autocrats of privilege, which
have usurped scepter and throne.
Farmers of America! Think well of
it. It rests with you to say whether
you will drag along behind the plow,
or whether you will rise to what is
possible and TAKE YOUR SEAT
UPON THE THRONE.
