THE ATTITUDE OF THE K. K. K. TOWARD
POLITICS;AND POLITIGAL PARTIES
By the GRAND DRAGON,
Realm of Illinois
Klansmen no doubt have noticed
through the press the propaganda
that is being broadly disseminated
throughout the ‘ country that the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan is ert
gaged in a conspiracy to get control
of the local, state and national gov
• ernment. This is but the beginning
of propaganda that is to be -nation
wide, and is intended to put the Klan
in the hole in the matter of political
affairs, and because of this fact it is
necessary that our position be clearly
and definitely stated and understood.
As American citizens we are inter
ested in matters pertaining to our
government above everything else,
and every real Klansman must appre
ciate the value and worth of citizen
ship with all that it stands for, and
what it means, not only to himself,
but to his children after him.
This is a “government of the peo
ple, by the people, and for the peo
ple,” and to that end we desire seri
ous consideration and action on the
part of every real American. The
organization is not partisan in any
sense of the word. It is made up of
men of different political faiths, but
as American citizens and members of
this great organization, we have a
right to demand of our political par
ties absolute loyalty and interest to
American principles and ideals,\ and
we have a duty to see that political
parties enunciate in their platforms
those principles so clearly and defi
nitely that they can be understood by
all; and to that end we should be con
stantly vigilant and active in partici
pating in the conventions of the sev
eral political parties. We should see
to it that principles embodied in res
olutions should find expression in po
litical platforms, so that when they
are enacted into the laws of our state
and nation they will adhere to the
benefit and welfare of our people in
the maintenance of Americanism.
We are not interested in the suc
cess of any particular party or indi
vidual, but we are deeply interested
in the making of just laws and in the
selection of men of such type and
character as will give us a guaranty
of the enforcement of the same in the
interest of good citizenship. There
fore, it is altogether fitting that those
men who are affiliated with the Re
publican party and the Democratic
party, or any other party, are of the
type and character that can be de
pended upon to do their whole duty
without fear or favor. So we must
give attention to the primaries and
conventions to the end that we may
have men to select from as our offi
cers who will measure up to the high
est standards of efficiency.
There are certain elements that we
have a right to expect to find in those
men whom we select for service.
They must be clean men in their
lives and habits.
They must be honest and depend
able.
They must be capable.
They must be loyal to the great
fundamental principles of our gov
ernment, our ideals and our institu
tions, and this loyalty shall be abso
lutely beyond question. If Klansmen
will give proper attention to the
above suggestions, we will have no
reason to regret the outcome at the
polls.
The matter of government is the
most important thing that touches
our lives as citizens, and if we are
negligent, we cannot expect the best
from governmental administration.
As Klansmen we have rights, duties
and obligations, and no real Klans
man can afford to be indifferent nor
recreant to political affairs in his lo
cal community, state or nation. We
have no desire to dictate political
preferment when it comes to the
matter of political party; neither
would we have our members disas
sociate themselves from the political
parties of their choice to the extent
that hey become NON-PARTISAN, as
his would make impossible participa
tion in those affairs that are of su
preme interest to us; on the other
hand, we would have every Klansman
to be so zealous and so jealous of his
party that he would not suffer it to
be used in any way against the high
est interest and greatest good of his
country, and we would have him so
determined that he would see to it
that men of the proper type and
character are the standard-bearers of
his party. When these two elements
do not obtain in his party, a Klans
man should possess that hardiness of
manhood and sturdy devotion to
Americanism that he would not hes
itate one moment in casting his bal
lot in the interest of those ideals in
which we believe and for which we
stand.
Under our present form of govern
ment, political parties are virtually* a
necessity, but they are only instru
ments to be used by the people of
our nation as means of service, and,
as American citizens, we are inter
ested in seeing that that service is
rendered and the common good ob
tained.
It is not too early for us to begin
scanning the political horizon. In
fact, we should make a survey of the
situation and constantly bear in mind
the type and character of men that
we are going to call into service. We
want and must have men who can put
the common good above self and self
ish interests, and who will put the
common welfare of our people above
the mere matter of party success.
If we have and maintain this idea and
adhere to it as our ideal, we will
render a great service for all the
people of our great country.
Political Activities
Let each organization, Great Titan
ahd Field man immediately send in
to this office their recommendations
along political * lines, national, state
and county officers, for the approach
ing election for our careful consider
ation and investigation of the respec
tive candidates as to their qualifica
tions, experience, etc., with a view to
dissemina.ting that information to the
Klansmen with our recommendation,
indorsement or comment for their
guidance at the polls, so that they
may cast an intelligent ballot, predi
cated upon prior information, data
and investigation, showing the true
facts about the respective candidates’
qualifications or lack of ability to fill
the position to which he aspires.
Heretofore too many voters have
gone to the polls and indiscriminate
ly voted for men from ipere caprice
cr personal fancy, or because of lack
of any information at all as to the
candidate, put a cross in the party
circle and let it go at that.
Every elector is entitled to one
vote on each and every question sub
mitted on the ballot. He is entitled
to vote as a Klansman and ought to
vote. We have pledged to use our
vdte intelligently, and if we want to
better community affairs we must
take pride in our civic duty, partic
ularly with reference to casting our
ballot for men better qualified for the
particular office ’they seek than the
average politician. In this way we‘
will begin doing real constructive
work for the betterment of the com
munity in which we live. Haphazard
voting for Tom, Dick and Harry can
not be countenanced by Klansmen
who are presumed to know something
about political affairs in their com
munity. There is no excuse for the
Klansman elector going to the polls
uninformed as to who is running and
who is best qualified for the partic
ular position. This information can
always be secured from these head
quarters, as we make it our business
to know who is running for office in
this state. We are always ready,
able and willing to give authentic in
formation concerning hll candidates
for any particular office and with
such information the elector can
weigh their qualifications for himself
and act accordingly, or even accept
the recommendations of this office
with full assurance that they are
made impartially without preference
to party alliances, but solely on the
merits of the particular candidate en
dorced and a vote for such a candi
date would be intelligently cast.
Every Klansman as an elector is
admonished to register and vote every
chance he has. Don’t let the other
fellow do it for you. Every time a
Klansman stays home and neglects to
vote it is equivalent to two votes cast
by the stand-patters. The old stand
patters of the political bosses are out
bright and early every election day,
and never miss an opportunity to
vote, and they do vote at least once.'
And the Grand Dragon has known of
many cases where they have voted
as often as twice. In many instances
voted in the name of some honest
elector and taxpayer who, by his act
and neglect to vote, virtually said to
them that they could run the commu
nity to suit themselves and be satis
fied to bide the results.
Electors who are satisfied to let
just anybody at all run the Ship of
State are in no position to complain
about the mismanagement of state
affairs. The time and place to stamp
out a known evil is at its source. The
ballot box is the beginning of a good
administration or a bad administra
tion.
Every Klansman that neglects and
refuses to take part in civic affairs
not only ignores and forfeits his con
stitutional right to vote, but imperils
and jeopardizes the very community
in which he lives. The devil is con
tinually walking up and down the
earth seeking whom he may devour,
and on election day his agents are
especially out bright and early. The
trouble has been that the righteous
man, so-called, is secreted in his
closet at home praying to Providence
to save him from certain ruin and
destruction. It is all right to pray
without ceasing, but get yourself out
of the closet and pray while you are
on your way to the the Lord
to guide and direct you how to cast
an intelligent ballot for the best man
who will serve the community most
efficiently. You cannot simply pray
to the Lord to bring about results
and then sit back and wait for Him
to do it. Prayer without intensive
activity on the supplicant’s behalf is
misguided devotion. Almighty God
does not want a Klansman’s prayers
ascending on high, “God, save our
community from certain ruin and de
struction,” unless that same Klans
man bestirs himself and allows the
Lord to use him to bring about the
desired results. How preposterous it
is for a man on election day to stay
home and pray, “Lord, cause the right
man to be elected today/’ and at the
same time staying home and refusing
to go and vote, as the Lord has en
dowed him with good, sound horse
sense and judgment to vote. Klans
men, bestir your lethargy. Remem
ber your obligation.

MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE
The daily press reports that at
Tulsa, Okla., three men had pleaded
guilty to a rioting charge committed
some two years ago, and the court
gave them the minimum penalty of
two years in the penitentiary. The
reports further say that each of those
who pleaded guilty stated that he
was a member of the Klan. If this
last report be true, there was a mis
carriage of justice. Each of them
should have been given the maximum
penalty, or at least more than the
minimum. When a Klansman is
guilty of a crime he should be dealt
with much more severely than one
who is not, for he has been taught
better and obligated to obey all laws.

EDUCATION’S TASK
Education that fails to fit men and
women to play an intelligent com
manding part as sovereign citizens
in a great industrial and political
world fails of what must in this day
be its prime purpose. It is not
enough to have understanding and
good education among a few; what
we require is good understanding
and good education en masse. We
must in the mass understand the
problems with which we must deal
as a democratic people. We can ad
vance and develop democracy but
little faster than we can advance and
develop the average level of intelli
gence and knowledge within the de
mocracy. That is the problem that
confronts modern educators. Thas
is the problem that confronts democ
racy itself.

IS THERE A KOCK-ROACH
IN THE OLD KLAN KLOGK?
(Continued from page Two)
Recent Speakers
Recent, as well as more remote
speakers, for that body, who have
hurled their phillipices, and composed
their diatribes against the Klan, have
one and all made it appear that the
term INVISIBLE, as applied to the
REALM and TO THE EMPIRE by
the Klan ritual, means that the Klan
has set up a SUPER-GOVERNMENT
to control the visible government.
Those of us who will reflect for a
moment, and particularly those who
have crawled across the IMAGINARY
SANDS OF SAHARA ON OUR
BARE KNEES, or WHO HAVE
PLUNGED OUR HANDS INTO
MOLTEN IRON, to prove our fear
lessness, and our right to be entrust
ed with the secrets of the HOLI
SMOKI-BLACKROBIC - ORDER OF
SPENDTHRIFTS, are convinced that
such speakers are not only LIARS
BY NAME, but THEY - 'ARE LIARS
FOR HIRE. Such liars are not
worthy the serious consideration of
decent people.
Get Wise Americans
I trust that the American people
will get wise to the fact that IGNOR
ANCE IS NOT THE CAUSE FOR
PERSECUTION OF THE KLAN, but
rather criminality is the cause.
Personally I have made my choice,
and when it falls out that some Klans
man shall stick an application form
under my nose, I shall satisfy that
consuming curosity of mine, which
would knQW whether the KLAN HAS
A GREAT AND ABIDING SECRET,
as YOUR WRITER SANBALLAT
CHARGES IT HAS, or if it is just
another of those IN THE RUT SO
CIETIES, MADE UP OF FLUFF
AND FULBDUB, THAT SATISFI
ETH NOT. It wants to know “IS
THERE A KOCKROACH IN THE
OLD KLAN KLOCK?
Marvelous Growth
The growth of the Klan has been
so marvelous, that I am inclined to
believe that the Klan has SOME OB
JECTIVE, and A GREAT SECRET,
capable of keeping men’s minds,
hearts and hands busy.
As a secret society man, who pos
sesses the pass word, and the other
requirements for entrance—to almost
every secretr order in the United
States—excepting the N’Bai Brith,
the Knights of Columbus and the
Ku Klux Klan, I have longed for the
day to come when A REAL SECRET
ORDER WOULD ENGAGE THE
MILLIONS OF PATRIOTIC, PRO
TESTANT CHRISTIAN AMERI
CANS, and if that day has come with
the Klan, I shall be but too pleased
to take my humble sf&nd with the
other millions of Klansmqjfc and in
unison march, under the folds of old
glory, in the light of the fiery cross,
and to the tune of ONWARD CHRIS
TAIN SOLDIERS, to higher and bet
ter things.
THANKING YOU FOR YOUR

„ r . THE CALL OF THE NORTH
THE fUNDAMEfiTALDOOTRINES OF
i PROTESTANTISM VS; ROMANISM
By REV. MARK A. MATTHEWS
2 Timothy 3:16 17—All Scripture
is given by inspiration of God, and
is profitable for doctrine, for re
proof, for correction, for instruction
in righteousness. That the man of
God may be perfect, thoroughly fur
nished unto all good work.
1 Timothy 2:s—For there is one
God, and one mediator between God
and man, the man Christ Jesus.
1 Peter 2:s—Ye also, as lively
stones, are built up a spiritual house,
an holy priesthood.
' The present hour is pregnant with
the possibilities of danger due in
large measure to the neglect of the
fundamental doctrines on which our
faith, otft* constitution and our liberty
rest. We can render no better serv
ice than to reaffirm those fundamental
doctrines and call the people to rec
ognize, practice and teach them to
posterity. They are founded in
Scripture, they are written in the
constitution of templarism, -and they
have given to us our glorious herit
age. God’s infallible"'Word is the
foundation of all doctrine, righteous
ness and revelation. You cannot
build a moral character without it,
nor can you stabilize government if
you neglect it.
The Scriptures reveal to us the
only intermediary that God has ever
permitted to exist between man and
Himself. Jesus Christ, born of the
Virgin, vicariously dying upon the
cross, raised from the dead by Al
mighty God, ascended to the right
hand of the Father, and in glorious
expectation coming again to receive
His own unto Himself, is God’s Me
diator between man and Himself.
There is no other. No earthly inter
mediary has ever been sanctioned by
Almighty God or permitted in the re
gime of Greece.
Through the vicarious work of
Christ for our redemption we are
lifted by the regeneration of the Holy
■Ghost into the state of universal
priesthood. The equality, the democ
racy, and the universal priesthood of
believers is God’s decreed status of
every Christian in this world regard
less of his rank, position, color or sta
tion. *
Let us study for a moment the
march of history according to these
fundamental principles:
The first 100 years of the church’s
history were years of sacrificial
Christianity, pure and unadulterated.
Because the gospel was reached and
the brotherhood and priesthood of
saints was universally recognized.
In the second century ambition en
tered into the hearts of many and the
forces of evil began to work endeav
oring to minimize sacrificial Chris
tianity and the equality of believers.
In the third century organization
began to accumulate power and de
mand its centralization.
In the fourth century was the as
sumption of power, the dictation of
the ambitious. The Pilgrims felt and
experienced the unhloy assumption of
ambition and tyranny.
In the fifth century piety died,
persecution began, dismemberment of
the Roman empire ensued.
In the sixth century, or in the year
590, Boniface became Pope by that
bloody agent, Phocas.
From the seventh to the eleventh
century was the struggle. No pen
will ever be able to write a descrip
tion of the struggle and the perse
cution and the anxiety that were ex
perienced under the accumulating
tyranny of the combined pagan, po
litical and unholy powers that were
trying to get hold of the church and
make of her their agent.
In the eleventh century the
churches of Europe were proclaimed
to be one and under the control of
one dictator. But they did not reck
on with the forces that had never
bowed the knee to papal ambition on
dictation.
In the twelfth century the Wal
denses were discovered nestling in
the mountain fastness. They refused
to recognize the proclamation that
assumption had issued, and swore
that they would never bow the knee
to papal dictation or to priestly
tyranny.
In the thirteenth century the Pope
tried to suppress them, but it was
impossible to suppress such spirits.
They stand today as God's beacon
light of liberty on the shores of an in
destructible history.
In the fourteenth and fifteen cen
turies their work was being felt,
their resistance was making its im
press, their championship of liberty,
of righteousness, and of individual
conscience was having its effect upon
the world. And out of the accumu
lating power of their doctrine, which
was the fundamental doctrine of
Scripture, which was the decree of
God, and which is the fundamental
doctrine of Protestantism, the Refor
mation issued.
* The Reformation was not only the
result of the unmentionable, unbear
able, and indescribable hellishness of
popery, but it was also the trium
phant march of the fundamental doc
trines of Scripture «and of Protest
antism. It was the march of truth
that brought the Reformation. It
was the triumph of God’s Word that
produced the victory of the Reforma
tion. It was the dynamic energy of
the great fundamental doctrines of
Christianity that gave to the world
all that he Reformation proclaimed.
Let us study for a moment the
exact things that were founded upon
the Scriptures produced by the Refor
mation, and that are today the God
given heritages of Protestantism.
First. The mind was liberated.
Men were permitted to think and
write and speak.
Second. The Scriptures were lib
erated. They had been chained by
tyranny, suppressed by assumption,
and denied to the common people by
a cruelty and a viciousness beyond
any man’s description.
Third. Christ, God’s Mediator be
tween Himself and man, was revealed
to the world. He and His blood were
held up to the whole world as the
only means by which man could be
saved. Justification by faith was the
light that illuminated His face and
led a depressed world to fall at His
feet and beg for mercy. It lifted
the world from the doctrines and pen
ances and indulgences of paganism
and tyranny up to the htrone where
the righteousness of Christ and His
vicarious death became the ground
on which God rested the justification
of the saints.
Fourth. The . Reformation poured
out judgment on the beast. That
judgment has had its effect up to
the present minute and will have its
fruition in the future if timidity and
cowardice does not weaken the arm
of Protestantism.
Fifth. The Reformation started
the Protestant church, with its doc
trines of liberty and salvation, on its
march toward the evangelization the
world and the establishment of rep
resentative government on the earth.
In other words, the great funda
mental doctrines of Protestantism
that were pronounced by the Refor
mation are the following, viz.:
First. The absolute supremacy of
the Word of God.
The Reformation unchained the
Bible. It dethroned councils and
Vaticans.. Whatever help or illumina
tion may be in Christian conscious
ness or cultivated scholasticism or or
dained priesthood, the supreme, un
questionable authority in all matters
of faith or morals is the Word of
God. It is the dominant authority in
the soul of the Christian, the one
text book of the church, and the su
preme study of the minister. This
authority should be emphasized. The
formula of Chilling worth continues
to be the expression of our faith.
“The Bible, the whole Bible, and
nothing but the Bible is the religion
of Protestants.” The open Bible is
the chart of our American civiliza
tion. Its ethics are our efficient pro
tection for public virtue. It has been
largely eliminated from our public
schools, and our successive genera
tions have lost its training for a citi
zenship of integrity and patriotism.
It should be reinstated in its place
in the instruction of the common
schools. Both Old and New Testa
ments should be restored to a fire and
large place in pulpit reading, instruc
tion in family worship and personal
study.
What are we doing to keep the
fact of the supremacy of God’s Wofd
before the people? iLet me ask you
three questions:
(a) Are we reading it, mastering
it, believing it?
(b) Are we preaching it? Or are
we trying to emasculate it?
(c) Are we demanding that it be
come the foundation of our educa
tional system? and are we forcing
its introduction into the educational
institutions of the counry? This is a
fundamenal doctrine of Protestant
ism and fif Templarism, and upon all
these doctrines rests this Republic.
What are we doing to perpetuate
these foundations of the Republic?
Second. The absolute supremacy of
the Grace of Christ.
Justification by faith alone. The
atoning work of Christ cannot be
added to or taken from. The church
must not be put, in the place of
Christ. There can be no intermed
iary. The sacrifice of the Mass has
no Scriptural recognition. There can
be but one sacrifice for sin. The sal
vation of the soul is not by any sac
ramental agency or priestly authority
much less by character or any human
ability or experience, but by the blood
of Christ alone. There is no new
gospel. The message of the Refor
mation is the message of evangelism.
The address of the pulpit should be
direct and unmistakable. Whenever
the church fails, it is when she be
clouds or conceals or perverts her
mission. The evangelistic note is the
note of her salvation, the effective
challenge to human sin and need, and
the breath of benediction to the
homes and liberties of the nation.
Perhaps we should not stop to dis
cuss with men their shades of de
nominational distinctions. They have
no place nor part in our discussion.
But we do have the supreme place
for Jesus Christ. He is the Son of
God. It is His grace that is suffi
cient, essential and effacious. There
isn’t any other way by which men
can be saved. There isn’t any salva
tion in the church, its rituals, In
lodges, in education, or in evolution.
The salvation is in Christ. It is the
supremacy, efficacy, and vicarious
ness of His grace that makes possi-
ble the salvation of any soul. What
are we doing to teach it? Are we in
practice defending it? And are we
by precept and example presenting
the supremacy of Christ and His
grace to the world?
Third. The General Priesthood of
Believers.
The Reformation was a protest
against despotism. It reaffirmed the
liberty of the sons of God. It was a
defensfe of the personal conscience.
It proclaimed the right of private
judgment. It denounced coercion,
and enthroned in human hearts the
profound sense and recognition of in
dividual responsibility. It restored to
the soul its privilege of direct ap
proach to God. It established the de
mocracy of the church. It ordained
that separation of church and state
which has developed in its most evi
dent reality in this Republic. That
separation must be most valiantly
and persistently maintained. We are
in the presence of the insidious and
determined efforts of a dethroned ec
clesiasticism to regain its lost power
in civil legislation and government.
That way lie danger and dismay.
The state must be Christian, but not
ecclesiastical. The liberties secured
by Reformation principles must by
the same principles be preserved.
Ecclesiasticism must be rebuked in
any attempts for recognition and
power through partisan politics. The
Christian citizen should guard the
money and offices of the state against
any encroachments by sectarian am
bition, and our public officers should
be compelled to hold churches aloof
from the suspicion of such influences.
The life of the Republic lies in the
separation of church and state.
Perhaps within this division of the
doctrines lies our great militant field
of activity. There is a militant field.
There is no danger of visibly, or out
wardly uniting the church and state.
The enemies of government know
that as well as we do. Therefore,
they surreptitiously undertake to con
trol government, man bureaus, throt
tle speech, and subsidize the press.
In other words, they plan that their
pernicious doctrines and practices
may have in effect the same results
that might be obtained under a union
of church and state.
Why haven’t we passed the Smith-
Towner bill? Why didn’t we intro
duce the Bible into the schools of
the states? Why is the Protestant
church, pulpit and clergy ridiculed on
the moving picture screens of the
country? Why do they magnify the
sins, follies and mistakes of Protes
tant clergymen? There are no doubt
an equal number of mistakes made
in all branches. But why degrade
the Protestant branch of the church?
Why? Why? There is no other
reason except the premeditated one
that controls the act, namely, to strip
the Protestant church of her power
and to bring her ino disfavor if pos
sible. What are you doing? On
what do you stand? What brought
you into existence? The great fun
damental doctrines of God’s infallible
Word, the doctrines of Protestantism
brought you into existence. For
what purpose?
(a) That you might worship God
supremely.
(b) That you might serve un
flinchingly in the evangelization of
the world and in the defense of prin
ciple.
(c) That you might build for
posterity a government, a school, and
a home in which Christ is supreme,
the Bible is authority, and the priest
hood of believers before God is uni
versally recognized.
This is Protestantism. Do you be
lieve it? Will you live it? Will you
practice it? Will you defend it with
your life? If so, God grant super
natural strength to wour efforts.
Awake, the menace is at your
door, trying to contract your govern
ment and make this nation bow to its
will. Awake you sleeping Protest
ants. ‘

TRUTH
Salem L. Tyler
Truth was born in heaven
Immortal, without end.
The glory of God revelling;
Angels in homage bend,
Truth smiles in glist’ning dew drops
And breathes in every ffower;
Awes with crashing thunder,
But soothes by gentle shower.
Truth rides the flowing river,
And whispers ’mong the trees.
She chills with breath of winter,
But cheers by summer breeie.
She bleeds from many bruises,
And weeps at horror of wars;
She gleams from every sunbeam,
And shines in every star.

A new sickness has appeared re

a disease peculiar to church members.
The attack comes suddenly every
Sunday. No symptoms are felt Sat
urday night. The patient sleeps well,
and eats hearty breakfast, but about
church time the attack comes on and
continues until services are over in
the morning.
Then the patient feels easy and
eats a good dinner. In the afternoon
he feels much better and is able to
take a walk, talk about politics and
read the Sunday papers. He eata
a hearty supper, and about church
time he has another attack and stays
at home. He retires early, sleeps well
and wakes up on Monday morning re

does not have any symptoms of the
disease until the following Sunday,

And their heritage raped and taken
o’er
By they who never can understand
Aught, save that this is a fertile
land;
Where much of money is to be made
By the pirate's law of traffic and
trade;
And that of the robber-barons’ raid!
And the pirates’ and barons’ law is
theirs,
From their fraud-soaked marts
their altar stairs!
It was they who invented the “melt
ing pot;”
To accomplish that which God can
not;
Because, from his law, neither title
nor jot
Can pass, until fulfilled it be
To the last, lone atom of certainty!
With “alliance with Europe,” sur
charged with fears,
And ominous tokens of national tears,
We’ve “entangled” ourselves, for
years and years;
And if moral courage to close the
door
Be wanting we’re pitiably worse than
poor.

CUPPED WIN 6 AND
UNHOLY POLITICIANS
Whether you love him or not, you
must admit that William H. Anderson
is the head of the New York Anti-
Saloon League, and you will recall
that he has been indicted by the New
York grand jury for grand larceny,
forgery and extortion. It is alleged
that Mr. Anderson “believes that the
indictments are at least partly a po
litical plot, and that they are in some
sort the expression of the dislike of
certain Roman Catholic leaders for
the prohibition law.” Naturally, it is
a sad thing to think that religion and
politics must be mixed—Protestants
do not believe in such, a mixture. And
Mr. Anderson, we are led to under
stand, does not charge the whole Ro
man Catholic church with the respons
ibility. Among many things attribut
ed to the caustic pen of the much-be
deviled Mr. Anderson is the following
that shows his attitude and spirit:
“When the Protestant churches clean
up on the job they start by making
good on enforcement, by electing, sus
taining and retaining officials who will
use the entire power of government
for effective enforcement, the power
of these unholy politicians will be
broken and the wings of their eccles
iastical allies will have been clipped.
With the de-alcoholization of the
reigning Irish dynasty now ruling
New York and grasping for Washing
ton with the help of a recent mission
to a foreign power, it will be found
that a host of other problems have
settled themselves or “Been put in the
course of final and satisfactory settle
ment." All of which is no doubt true
—and easily understood in spite of
Mr. Anderson’s twisted grammar!
