THE STORY OF A MURDER
EN’LEMEN, you’ve killed
me! You’ve killed me!”
Such were the startling
words of the old man as
he fell to the ground in
I < B
the midst of the excited crowd.
Not many months before, old Jim
mie Jackson was living, with such pa
tience and content as a poor man can
command, upon his one hundred-acre
farm, absorbed in the spring progress
of and cotton, and vegeta
bles-- The place was only available
for farming, owing to its interior lo
cation, though a partially navigable
river bordered one side of the tract.
Land being outlawed in the financial
system of the Government, the cash
value of this farm was not more than
twelve hundred dollars. But its own
er had no wish to part from it. It
had 'dato. him from his father, and
for fcrty years he had owned the
homely old house, and tilled the mel
low fields. His three or four children
he had bred to farm labor, being too
poor to educate and lift them up to
easier and more elegant paths in life.
They married, and built humble
homes on the little home place, and
old Jimmy, and his wife, and sons,
and daughters, and grandchildren,
toiled, and produced, and consumed
in common.
The only thing that ever moved
him to think for a moment of sell
ing, was a mortgage-debt he had been
fighting for years. It had been pain
fully reduced to five hundred dollars,
and there, as he said in homely
phrase, “it stuck and wouldn’t go no
furder down.” It had come by his
falling into the hands of the supply
merchant, whose enormous profits,
and the occasional crop failures, had
consumed, from year to year, more
than the fruits of his overstrained
muscles.
One of old Jimmy’s nearest and
oldest neighbors was
Samuel Snapmup.
He was one of those remarkable
men who attract boodle as if by mag
netism. Or like afl track-bug, that car
ries away some particle of everything
it touches. There was never a neigh
borhood which did not possess one or
more of these creatures, that, like
potato bugs, suck and fatten on the
juices of their neighbors.
One day, in an apparently acci
dental way, Snapmup overtook the
old man as they were both going to
the postoffice, and “bantered” him
for a trade.
“What ’en I got that you want,
Sam?” said old Jimmy.
“I want,to buy your place.”
“Oh, you’re'jest jokin’. You don’t
need my land. You’ve got more’n
you kin ’tend to now.”
“Yes, but I need your’n fer an out
let to the big road, an’ to straighten
out my track. I’m not jokin’. If
you want to sell, and will take a fair
price, I’m your man.”
“What’ll you gi’ me?” asked the
old man, whose curiosity was becom
ing aroused by the first intimation of
Snapmup’s wish to buy the place.
“I’ll give you one thousand dol
lars in cash. It’ll git you out o’ debt
at once.”
“Yes, an’ leave me noth’n ’tall to
go on,” answered Jackson. “No, I’m
gitt’n too old to shift about. What
kin I do with five hundred dollars?
An’ what’ll the chil’un do?”
He looked with his honest eyes at
his neighbor, who was keenly regard
ing him with the “foxy” expression
which is habitual with most "sharp
men.” The old man rubbed his
stubby beard with a rasping sound,
and went on:
“No, no. Es I caint git more’n
that I’ll stick to the ol’ place, and
try an’ work out. I won’t live many
year no how, an’ es I caint pay more’n
the intrust with a few dollars on the
principul, we’ll git a livin’, an’ that’s
fcetter’n sellin’. Lan’s ain’t never
<6m**to be wuth much in these parts,
but they do to git a livin’ out’n.”
They had now reached the horse
rack in the village, and were hitching
their horses.
“The fact is, Uncle Jimmy,” said
Snapmup in the oily tone that never
failed of magnetic effect, “I would
like to help you out of your troubles
if I could. I’d like the best in the
world to own your track as an outlet
to the big road, but besides that I’d
like to do you a favor. Your lan’
ought re’ly to be wuth more’n what
I named for it. Mebbe I’ll see you
again, an’ make you a better offer.”
And the two men went each about
his errand.
After nightfall of the same day
Snapmup was closeted with three
strangers at the village hotel.
"Well, what luck, Mr. Snapmup?
Have you seen old Jackson?”
This was the question that greeted
the visitor as he entered the room
where three well-dressed strangers
sat smoking together.
"Yes, I seen ’im this evenin’,” he
answered, “an’ I’ll git ’im, but we
must offer more’n a thousand.”
“How much do you think will fetch
him?”
"I think fifteen hundred in cash
will do the job.”
"Well, you push the thing tomor
row, and try and close it up. Delays
are dangerous. Take the deed in your
own name, as agreed, and come here
at once after you get it, and deed the
tract to us according to our under
standing.”
"All right,” returned Snapmup,
“I’ll do it fust thing in the
mornin’.”
Then in a few minutes a paper
was signed which stipulated that
Snapmup was to purchase Jackson’s
land in his own name, but was to
hold it in trust for the three strange
gentlemen, and was to convey it to
them at once. And for this service,
he was, upon delivery of the deed, to
receive one hundred dollars in cash,
and afterward a deed back of two
acres of the Jackson land to be se
lected by himself.
Snapmup next morning called at
old Jimmy’s house, and after a
plausible talk in which he represent
ed how the old man with a thousand
dollars surplus, after paying off his
debt, could purchase a smaller place
in the neighborhood at low figures,
succeeded in persuading old Jackson
to sell, and the deed was promptly
executed, and the money paid down.
The old man insisted, however, upon
the right to occupy the house to the
end. of the year, and gather and en
joy the crops.
Throughout the transaction the
victim never for a moment suspected
his neighbor of having any other mo
tive for purchasing the place than the
desire to enlarge his own farm, and
secure a better outlet to the public
road. Being without guile himself,
he was incapable of anticipating and
guarding against crooked methods.
Up to the time of this land transac
tion his neighborhood had known
nothing of land speculators. He was
not a man of the world, nor a news
paper reader, and did not dream that
a school of competitive system sharks
had entered the still waters where
his uneventful life was being passed.
A month afterward old Jimmy
Jackson learned casually that one or
two other persons near by had sold
out, and gradually the strange fact
became known that almost every foot
of the river front, covering more than
three square miles, had mysteriously
changed owners about the same time
that he had parted with his tract.
And in every case it was some neigh
bor who had bought out one or more
of his poorer neighbors on the pre
text of an outlet, or for timber, or
pasture, or water for stock, etc.
Then came flying rumors that a
city was to be laid out along the river
bluffs, a railroad built, and extensive
manufactures established on those
old farms.
Full of regrets, and distressful
ISfye 3effersonlan
forebodings, old Jackson rode to the
court-house town to learn if the deed
records would throw any light upon
the matter, and to his horror he
found it all too true. There of record
was his deed to Snapmup, and Snap
mup’s deed to the land-sharks, and
their deed to the Boomburgh Land
and Improvement Company.
It was a fact, the recorder told the
anxious inquirer, that the surveyors
would be at his place very soon, sur
veying and marking the town lots.
Jackson held his tongue, but his
heart stood still, and his face blanch
ed. He saw that he had been over
reached by his next door neighbor, in
the most villainous manner. He felt
those excruciating pangs which follow
in the wake of lost opportunity. He
thought of his worn-out and faithful
wife, and his children, brought up in
ignorance for want of money, of their
struggles with poverty, and of his
grandchildren who might have been
spared the same awful fate, and he
writhed under that unspeakable an
guish which only the loss of prop
erty can bring to a loving husband
and father. Wealth, and all the good
things it would have brought to his
dear ones, had been filched from him
and had gone into the hands of cold
blooded speculators.
His lawyer told him that the
courts could afford him no remedy—
that our own Christian Government
system offered premiums to the cun
ning; that the mainspring of civilized
progress rested in the deadly con
tests of the wolves for the possession
of the lambs.
"But it’s as bad as stealin’,” Jack
son protested. "Snapmup deceived
me. He took advantage of me. Ain’t
ther’ no protection fer an honest
man?”
But the man of law firmly said no
by a shake of the head.
So old Jimmy mounted his old
plough nag and jogged homeward,
borne down by the burden of hope
less disappointment. With dry lips,
and husky voice, he told his family
what he had discovered, and gloom
settled upon all those humble house
holds.
From that day the old man’s appe
tite failed him, and he grew weaker
and weaker from day to day in body
and mind. His garden and crops
were neglected, and he wandered
feebly about as if always in search
of something he had lost.
On the tract which he had sold
there was a beautiful wooded plateau
just in front of his house, and here it
was determined by the land company
that the center of the town should be
located. Old Jimmy looked out of
his house at an early hour one morn
ing, and found the surveyors at work
laying off the streets. Then came a
large force of hands with axes, and
picks, and scrapers, and began cut
ting down the trees, and grading.
And this work continued from week
to week. And the land company es
tablished a newspaper, to be publish
ed temporarily In the adjoining vil
lage.
It was called the Boomburgh Ga
zette, and was aflame with praises of
the new city town-site, and announc
ed an auction sale of lots at an early
day, and asserted that the place
would have ten thousand inhabitants
within twelve months, and that a
thousand mechanics and laborers
were wanted at once to grade streets
and build houses, and that lot pur
chasers should have special advan
tages if they would build at once, and
promised that they could realize an
enormous percentage in the way of
rents, not to speak of the wonderful
advance that would inevitably take
place in prices.
The paper also published the
names of the originators of the en
terprise, and their lieutenants, and
lauded them in the most fulsome
manner. They were great public
benefactors. They were building up
the waste places of the country, and
HENRY_ CLAY FAIRMAN
in obedience to their wise foresight,
and sagacious management the land
lately desolated by the ruthless hand
of war would soon “bud and blossom
as the rose.” All honor to our men
of enterprise, and confusion to pes
simists and croakers!
It was with a leaden heart that
Jimmy Jackson looked upon the
booming improvements, and read the
praises of those who had despoiled
him in the names of business, prog
ress and patriotism.
A few days before the day of the
great sale arrived, some one brought
him a map of the projected city. It
was a triumph of the lithographic
art, and showed all the details of the
locality. There were the broad river,
and the future steamboat wharf, and
the high knoll where the stand-pipe
of the waterworks was to be planted.
There were the ravines, and the
creeks, and even the spring that had
supplied water to the Jacksons for
more than fifty years. It was de
lineated so clearly that to old Jim
my’s vision the water seemed to be
trickling across the paper. He had
never realized until now, when it was
too late, too late! how beautiful and
how precious those objects and locali
ties were.
A considerable number of lots
seemed to have been already disposed
of at private sale, for the owners
names were printed upon them. It
was a terrible shock to the old man
when he found the name of Sam
Snapmup on a number of the choicest
lots in the wooded plateau. He now
saw clearly through the whole
scheme, and wrung his hands in fu
tile rage and mortification. He sent
Snapmup word to come and see him,
but the successful manipulator kept
away.
The day of the great sale brought
hundreds of people and a band of
music. In carriages, on horseback,
and on foot the speculators traversed
the fields £.nd woodlands inspecting
the lots.
Old Jimmy Jackson watched the
people from his porch, and heard the
hum of their voices, and brooded
over the wrong that he had suffered.
And at length when the gray-haired
auctioneer ascended his wagon, and
began to talk wittily and eloquently
about the magnificent business blocks
that in a year or so would adorn the
spot where the assembled people
were standing, and to eulogize the
men who had been so wise as to
foresee that Providence had from
the beginning of the world reserved
those lovely bluffs and smiling val
leys as the site of a splendid city,—
the old man Jest the house and walk
ed as one fascinated to the scene.
As he drew near, the speaker was
saying that amongst those whom his
tory would remember as instrumen
tal in securing the site for the God
appointed land company, was Sam
Snapmup. And while this favored
individual was smilingly enjoying
the speech, old Jimmy suddenly con
fronted him.
"Sam Snapmup, you’ve ruined me.
You said you wanted the land for
yourself. What d’ you mean by
treatin’ me this way?”
His voice trembled and he was al
