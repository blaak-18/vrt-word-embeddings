NOTICE TO ADVERTISERS.
All ldefendants in judicial sales
have the right to select the paper1
in which the advertisement is to be
inserted, therefore we would ask
our friends to give us a bid before
a lvertisinr. The Populist is be
ing run in the interest of humani
ty, and it is the duty of all men to
support it. Also those who enter
homesteads have a right to select
their o% n lpaper for advertising.
Don't fail to give us a call and we
will treat you well.
"They tell us we are weak and
unable to cope with so formidable
an adversary. But when shall we
be stronger? Next week or next
year ? Shall we gather strength
by irresolution and inaction? We
are not weak if we make a proper
use of those means which God and
nature have placed in our hands."
Patrick Henry.

hlaving Iaen invit,.d, by the it
letter we ipubliished in I:st issue an
from ('Chaler, to :ttn.i a People''e a
party club meeting in Ward ;, we tu
ioncned all the clothes we had early rol
Saturday morning, seat,:d ,our,.lf cv
in our wife's Inuggy. behind a hir- tw
ed horse not quitVe as old as his pIl
master. and slightly backward
about going forward, and turned ltl
our back on the March wind and lot
our face to the beautiful S1,rin,_ or
sunshin'e.
After crossing ('ane river on the I
great iron bridge in front of town bi
and passing the (i. ('. Oil Mill he- t
low town. we turned our attention a
to the country.
The beautiful landlscaelws diver
:ified with field and meadow, for- t'o
et tree and orchard, eardens andt
pastures, crowned with the cozy tI
cottage or the stately plantationll
home of the owner, who on this
particular day was making good to
use of the sunshiue by lazily pull
ing the lines and drawling *out the
"gee, whoa, haw" music of the q
farm or was having it (lone by his "r
best man while he hied himnself off I
to the village post-oflice for the fn
weekly palper, formed a scenery in
upon which our eyes feasted as we 12
wound our way upon the banks of w;
the quiet, meandering river. to
high noon found us in the vi- «
cinity of Marston postoffice, where of
by going into their fields or follow- te
ing them to the postotfice we met el
our friends Messrs. T. E. Powell, tl
M. H. Holloway, 0. O'Quinn 31
and others, and taking advantage ii
of the hour politely invited Mr.
Holloway to accept the pleasure of Il
our company to dinner, where the tli
kind treatment of his accomplished w
lady and the innocent prattle of to
his four rosy-faced, stout little il
chillron made us feel quite at home ft
but the table well loaded with those a,
things which always made the far- e_
mers table the best place on earth
to kill hunger, made us feel very 01
far from home, not the least among
those things was the huge goblet of
fresh buttermilk that slaked our
thirst like "Belle of Lexington"
to the old toper from a prohibition s
town.
Accompanied by Mr. Holloway bi
we continued our pleasant journey in
down the beautiful Cane river for o
most of the afternooh. of
We spent most of the afternoon at
ride in reading aloud Morgan's to
Buzz Saw, while Mr. Holloway in
held the lines and laughed heartily ol
at Morgan's keen witticisms and
jokes on the old parties. We fre- ai
quently had to stop reading and ol
assist with the laughter, as Mr. pi
Holloway, though an expert hand at
at the business, could hardly do 01
the subject justice, and we are sure '
that the wondering natives who tl
happened tobe in hearing of our c
fun, ascribed lit to the aforesaid
Belle of Lexington rather than to "
its great enemy-buttermilk and b
Morgan's Buzz Saw.
Just before sundown we drove
up to the pleasant little home of
our good old friend W. F. Eversull,
whom we called to the gate and
demanded possession. He acquies
rcedl without argument, and we
rwere soon comfortably quartered o
around his cheerful fireplace, while I
his able-bodied, kind-hearted boys
(lost our pencil and forgot how
many) took charge of our "ambu
lance" and the animal it contained.
SAfter we had enjoyed another t
P meal of substantials prepared by
Sthe gentle, motherly old wife, who
Shas paid the world so dearly for
-all she has received from it, the
'tneighbors began to come In, and
Sbetween them and the young Ever
II saulls, we thought the club had as
II sembled, and that ward 9 was pret- I
- ty well represented.
* We all walked a few rods down
W to the village church hboase where
Sseveral neighbors had already as- I
aI embled and lighted the beautithl,
' large swinging lamps and had a

Slarge heater. After an all round I

Somewhere between 9 and 10 \\
o'clock a. . i. Mr. lollioway turned er
"right side up with care," and fo
promising our friends an early and fo
frequent return trip, we Legan to de
movegradually to the northwardand in
12:30 p. Ii. found us at Mi. Ilollo- cc
way's residence where we stopiped
to rest our horse and feed ourself. to
We chatted pleasantly for a couple tm
of hours with this happy and in- 1,
telligent fahnily, who were reinforc
t ed on this occasion by Mrs. Powell, fo
the am:iable and interesting wife of pt
z Mr. T. E. Powell, their nearest "i
neighbor. to
Of course this stop included din- R
f ncr which was an mnprovement on )
the one of the day before, but as
I we exhausted our English trying
f to describe the first and never hay- 19
Sinug learned French, we shall desist
e from all attempt at description, i
and simply say that we ate "in

When time compelled us to turn
our face homeward we did so leav
ing many assurances that we would
renew our 4lueasant visit at no dis
taut day, anid as we j,outrneyed liAz
ily along in the evening sunshine
we dreamed of the time when we
should be able to own a home on a

Bland, Bryan & Co.
After all tile jugglings and mut
terings and liow-iumbllings of the
Free Silver Denlltrats. it appears
tihat their able intellects le0 still in
a wobbly condition.
This is indeed sad.
If our recellectiou does not flirt
with us, Mr. Bland arrived at the
c"parting of the w',ys" some two
years ago; yet instead of branch
inlg of and travelling forward, lhe
eems to reer to pre he pastinme of do

ing but never going anywhere.
Billy Bryan apl'iar1s to have

ing terms with travellers passing
on each side.
These gentlemen are making
themselves ridienlous.
The )emocratie party is further

This Congress has done things
for the gold standiard which even
John Sherman could not have
No Republican President and
Congress would have dared to ca
pitulate to Rothschild and Wall
street as Cleveland, Crisp & Co.,
have done.
It is idle to say the Democratic
party is not responsible, and is not
acquiescent.
It is responsible, and it ise ac
quiescent.
The Cabinet could have chocked
Cleveland any day it chose to do
Congress could have tied his
hands any day it wanted to do so.
Dia'nt Congress bind Andrew
Johnson, hand and foot I
Didn't Congress control Grant,
and Hays-and even Lincoln ?
What has the Cabinet done to
show it difiered from the Presi.

What has Congress done to ar
rest the fateful march of the gold
standard ?
What has the Democratic party
done to put the world on notice
- that it opposed the contraction of
a the currency, the forled interpre
station which makes the word coin
t mean gold, and the one-sided poli
( cy which receives silver at the Cus

The Sub-Treasury.
It is charged that we (the Peo
ple's party) favor the sub-treasury
system as proposed by the Alli
ance, and our opponents tax their
ingenuity to build straw men to
I tear down. The dleclaration of our
platform is plain on this question.
It says that we favor the distribu
tion of money through the sub
treasury, or a better system. Our
opponents think there is a better
system, and I think so too. In
fact, I believe that nearly all of
our party think so. I believe that
Sthe Omaha convention thought so
when it put a declaration mn the
platform favoring government pos
tal banks. We had made rapid
strides, educating the people along
the sub-treasury lines. It was
thought best by some of our peo
o ple not to drop it entirely at that
Stime. The principle involved was
all right. The details of the plan
Swere never settled upon except by
Sdemocratic orators and Dr. Macune
who tried to sell the People's party
Sin 1892, but failed to deliver the
a goods. It is generally conceded
r now that the only utility about the
. sub-treasury plan is to furnish
a democratic orators a theme to talk
i- about-something they know noth
. in g of-in order to give the people
i, a rest on the tariff racket.-Speech
