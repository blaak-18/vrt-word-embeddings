Southern Troubles and the Prospsct
of Reconstruction.
If the Southern States were in a con
dition of absolute tranquility, if the
equilibrium between the two races was
maintained justly nnd life, property
and respect for rights were assured, a-*
they are in well-governed cities, these
facts would be wi.hoiit parallel in the
li'stor*' of humanity. Where has it
ever happened that, with the social
foundation Inokeii up by a war which
desolated every fireside, with millions
of slaves, not merely made free, but
endowed with political lights, of whose
limitations they could have but a vague
coinprelientioii ; with the enfranchised
class favored by the protection and
co'intfiiancf ol the conq ieror, whose
generosity is so far abused by his
functionaries that he becomes an op
pressor—where with these elements
litis it ever happened that the people
have taken ilieir places again in the
new order with such good will, such
content, such occeptance of incalcula
ble changes us to leave nothing further
in that way to be desiied f Ir lias
never happened and never will happen
while men itre affected by the common
hiimaii emotions and passions. Fur
thernioie, we do not ladieve it has
ever >et happened in the world that a
people accepted the hard consequen
ces of a disastrous defeat with even so
much of heroic patience as has been
shown by our own peop.e ill the
Southern States.
So far, therefore, from seeing any
just cause for surprise iu the occasion
al ebullitions ot fury that disturb the
South, the greater reason fur wonder
is that such events are the exception
to the general coiidititin , that the peo
ple, with such widespread unanimity,
have returned to their everyday life,
to the occupations and pursuits of
peace, and that the restoration of order
and indiistiv measured by production
is well uiuli complete, and that crimes
aie no greater in •iiiuitier anil no worse
in character than ruin and idleness
will account lor in any community

with the riiartirterisficexaggeration of
I he political rtdren'nrers with whom
it is affiliated—tji«t it expected the en
ergetic and hotitempeficd people of the
Southern States to assume. In 'the

hand of n nice Arttnffr niât a pretty

prOperlv, it is as clear as noonday that
not an event has occurred in the South
that we had not abundant reason to

faet prepared and made inevitable In

also not an event h#s occurred that
wonbl not have occurred in any North

cities. Is tins the spit ir of reconstruc
tioti that is t<> make the country o:te
(iiüinii ? This is the plan that seems
the wisest to General Grant 's Attorney
General —to the head of ijie national
department of justice. If Mr. Williams
proposes to .'limself results stich, as
were secured by a distinguished man
i another department of justice in a
former age, he chooses his means ac
curately. If he wishes that his fulmi
nation of the national justice shall lie
come as f imotis in this country as was
that of Jeffreys in England, lie will
continue as he has begun,. Already he
has narrowly missed the splendid re
ward of the Chief Justiceship—the
price of his services in such a recon
struction of Lotiisiaua as has accom
plished the worst purposes that the
worst of party plunderers could possi
bly propose to themselves. And again,
he lends himself as the ready tool ol
a further application of similar pro
jects. Grant, indifferent as he seems
to opinion, keeps himself out of it, and
stays away as if thereby the lesnlts
might, not fall on his record. And t'e
commander of the army, as clear-head
ed in politics as he is in war. though
ousted from the national capital by an
intrigue, that he might, not be ill the
way of projects to which he could nev
er assent, protests that tlieie is no oc
casion to send troops into the South
ern States, flu r the man who'•recon
structed " Louisiana, and who would,
if I- ft. alone, have reconstructed Ar
kansas, is evidently ready to recon
struct as many other States as the
wicked designs of a plundering clique
may require. But even Jeffreys, with
all his atrocities, was at last compelled
to say, '• I was not half bloody even
for him that sent nie;'' and let Wil
liams hew h re lest at last he shall find
himself unequal to the infamy demai d
ed. and so lose not merely Iiis leward,
but even the right to claim it.

Our honor as a people is pledged to
the permanency of reconstruct ion so
far as it has gone; toits immunity
from any unjust or pitiful iuterlcrtnce
on onr part. Although, to use words
iu an extieme sense, the lives and pro
petty and rights of the Southern peo
ple. as they now liohl them, may be
called tlie gift of the Northern people,
because tln-y were forfeited, yet the
mere fict of giving a thing commits
the givei to a cerfan cotu>e. We can
not withdraw f he gift at. will. There
was, moreover, an implied condition.
They were to accept xome laws thai
we proponed and live according to
them, and thus it became a compact.
By the strongest ties of political uiorali
ty, therefore, we are bound to respect
the progrès» that reconslruction has
already made. For lis there is no es
cape from t lie compact but its violation
from the other side. Has the South
failed iu any of the observances that
were implied conditions of the rehabi
litation of the Southern State T No; it
is known that the Southern people are
earnestly doing their utmost to live
peaceably—to stand loyally by all the
conditions of their restoration to politi
cal rights. But ni» people can l»e sure
of its disorderly classes. No commu
nity can give a guarantee that murder,
arson, mhlierv or other outrage will
not be committed in its midst ; neither
can the South, more than any othei
Community, gite such a guaniiitee.and
to hold that because outrages are com
mitted by the disorderly therefore the
whole people must forfeit the position
they nave gained by the progress that
reconstruction has alt end .v made, is
merely the atrocious pret- nce of those
who have ends to gam ill the general
wretchedness of the Southern people.
Because ot this fact, in our |m »litical
condition it is urgently necessary thai
the people should come to an under
standing as apart 'rom the office hold
ers ami functionaries who pretentiously
represent them, but who abuse their
own advantage and betray the cause
the nation lias at heart, which i» the
full and sound restoration of national
unity in feeling and purpose. Con
gress has utterly failed, and we see no
other hope for reconstruction such as
it should be than a national convention.

Since our last report the river
has risen nearly eleven inchea—
caused by the rise at Shrereport,
rlie observer there reports a rise of
thirteen inches,. The raius , here
with the above rise has given tf*
this little swell and enabled as to
get Cotton off at our high water
prices this week, that is $150 a
bale. , . ,
/. The Bastrop passed here on the
rfct, having been nj. lor nearly two
mouths and is the only steamer
which reached Rhreveport in that
time from New Orleans except the
Wm. J. Behau nnd Belle Rowland.
W©ot course except the mosquito
fleet Brnner, Ida Leon and Royal
George, which steamers haye. been
dnriug the same period coouecting
with our lower river boats.
The Bryarly was our last Packet
down, and left our wharves with
about 350 Bales of Cotton, à very
good trip for the season and river.
The Fleta ought to be in sight
this morning, and with a fair freight
from the. Crescent City. She wan
advertised to leave, New Orleans
on Tuesday 29th ulL, but for some
reason did not get away. <>
The weather for thé past week
has been cool and pleasant, and a
good time for picking out cotton.
We learn that iu some places con
siderably over a bale of cotton to
the acre will be made—one party
says be will gather 18 bales from
14 acres, this proves that the crops
well attended to will give an abun
dant yield if the caterpillar will let
us do the picking.

ami was left on the ßebl where be remain,
ed some time, bciii|jp iu the enemy's lines.
Contrary to the |d vice of the surgeons,
lie refused to allow Iiis leg to be amputat
ed and by his youth aud powerful consti
tution recovered, to die at lastafter twelve
long years of his old wound. On the ad
vance of flen. Danks tip Red River, Lieut.
Jackson with his wound unhealed, joined
the advance guard and was captured—
while on the way to Fort l*eleware he as
sisted iu overpowering the guard, ami
seizing the vessel, aud though unable to
walk but a short ilistance by the aid of the
gond people of the ' glorious old North
State," finally escaped into our lines.
Resigning Iiis commission in the infan
try. lie became 1st Lieutenant and then
Captain in the 6th La. cavalry, where he
remained until the end of the war. A few
years ago lie united with the Baptist
church, soon after was ordained and as a
minister ot that denomination, became
«veil known in North Louisiana. A year
ago lie went on to Greenville, S. C., to
complete his theological course at tlie
Siminary, when his many friends and rela
tives were shocked by the intelligence of
his death after a brief illness. The Rev.
Ur. Hroadus, Principal of the Seminary,
writes in high terms of our friend and
says a career of great usefulness and bril
liaucy has come to an untimely end. At
the time of his death he was a member of
Oonly Lodge, Free aiid Accepted Masons.
We. have known the deceased long and
well, as a school and, college mate, a fel
low soldier and again in days of early
manhood, and can remember no word or
thought of nnkiiidness that ever passed
between us. I'eace to his memory ! though
tar awav f p om the State he loved so well
aud served so truly, he sleeps well. To
tlie frsil and gentle being w ho early in
life linked her fate with his, uowlett alone
we extend our warmest sympathy. In fee
ble health for years, we little thought that
lie would l>e first to go, but as the grand
oak is broken by the storm while the geu>
tie violet liows its lovely head, so has the
Angel of Death passed by and summoned
the strong man by lier side; why it hath
been dis|Nised she can learn alone from
liitii "who iloeth all things well.'*
