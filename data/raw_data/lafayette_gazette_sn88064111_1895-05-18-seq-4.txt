phaving recently been honored s "p
the asubect of- a special report" . by.
one of the experiment 'Lo~a.ls of t tia
nationil 4epeas4inent of agrlpultare.
The report ·crreto' . sease ipevalent
mistakes as to this little irticle of-on
sumption, gives astolnishiag statistics
as to its value as afood i productoriad
presents many interesting facts as to
its uses. `
It is pleasant teobe infaormed, first of
aln. that the peanutis not a utatall,
but a .pe andtd I it is a
that while cotton, In n oeptae
toes and tobacco have' usually bzeen
ohis importance which- America has,
given to the world, the peanut must
be added, as the weight of authority
fixes its birthplace in Brail. The
crop has, become of -primary i.mpo t
tane sines 1866, and lrginia- North
Carolina and Tennessee produce the
largest part of it. there are seven
varieties ultivated, some of them bunch
and some running vines. The yield
of this underground pea is astois ing,
and the 'amount cosmnmed' is a'testi
monial to its popularity. The yearly.
production here . aout0 4,0000,000
bushelsiof 22 pounds. whiely suppi y the
present demand in this country. This.
however, is but a small portion of the
world's crop. nThe exportatino from
Africa and India to -Europe in 1892
amoune4d to nearly 400o000,000 pounds.
The crop of the worldh may be safely
Sestimated at 8002000,00 pounds.
The value of the homely little ground
pea, however, becomes especially .ap
parent when its use are considered.
It is sorted in the factory into four
grades, the first..second and third be
ing sold to venders of the roasted pea
nut, either directlyor through jobbing
houses. The fourth grade is sold to
confectioners, and ater tedir mhanipa
lation reappears as peaSsut candy,
burnt almonds and in cheaper grades
of chocolates. The report says in this
connection: "The extent of the use of
the peanut by the American people
will be more ninly appreciated when it
is remembered that they rise 4,000,000
bushels of nutsyrearly (at a cost to the
consumers of $10,000,000),vhich do hot
form a part of the regular articles of
food but are eaten at'odd times." The
planter uses the nut as a fattener for his
hogs and the vine- as peanut hay for
his stock, and the feeding value is in
creased when sone' of the nuts are
cured and fed wi.i 'the hay. MNillions
of bushels are 'as" in the old world
for the pi.odu of oil, w'dch is
reg::rdecl at equ jive oil. :n fact,
gr,": t -ixantities airre used, unknown to
Ite onr. rt.; the l'oa pe. 4rL. tter.
;hiarseiiles lon : irifg'- 220,0000,000
pounds a year for thie making of al
ieged clhvo oil. :i: India, Europe,
Brazil and this country the oil is used
medicinally. It is employed by manu
facturers in fulling cloth. It makes a
good lighting fluid,, and is largely
used by the manufacturers of soap
and as a lubricant in machine
shops. The oil cake is used in Germany
for fattening cattle and sheep. It is
pronounced an excellent cattle food.
A grade known as "peanut meal" i.l
made by grinding the hulls, immature
peanuts, and those of inferior grades
and a certain quantity of sound nuts
mixed with other ingredients. The
residue, known as "peanut cake,"
makes good soup, griddle cakes, muf
fins, etc., and is one of the most nutri
tive foods for human as well as animal
consumption. The report says: "Al
though the experiment made with pea
nut meal and biscuits as food for the
German army was not so successful as
to induce the authorities to adopt it as
a part of the rations, still analysis has
shown conclusively that it is a most
nourishing food for man, and as com
pared with other well-known forms of
vegetable and animal food it has a
high nutritive value." From all of
which it appears that this little nut or
pea, which hitherto has been looked
down upon as the stock in trade of the
street corner vender, the food of the
gallery god, and the luxury of the cir
cus, has other and higher uses and is
one of the important staples of com
merce and plays a dignified and useful
part in the economy of man and beast.

preferred. There is a solid prtition ,a
between the stalls and the oribs,
a hinged door admitting the head
of each cow to her crib at feeding
time. When the ration has been eaten p
the doors are closed and buttoned. C
which forces the cows. to stand back 1
until their hind feet come to the edge B
of the gutter, and to lie down also in n
that situation. When the doors are b
Sclosed any manure that has fallen p
upon the platform .-while the cows
have been standing ahead feeding is
scraped into the gutter, and the cows d
left until the next feeding.
Where the manare cellar is under
the cattle it will be' found most con
venient to have the manure traps in
the raised walk, as shown, rather than
in the bottom of the gutter, where f
they are buried beneath the manure
and filthy - to handle. Baendy shelves
that are hinged and: folded against the t
wall when not in use are shown at the d
rear of the raised walk. The doors
admitting the cows' heads to the cribs c
in front will be found exceedingly a
convenient when feeding grain, roots
or ensilage. One can then put the
ration in the crib without molestation
from the horns or nose of the animal,
eager to get at its breakfast or dinner.
The door can then be unbuttoned and
allowed to swing in against the side
of the crib, when the cow can come
forward and eat. t'he crib can be
made to fold down against the outside
of the partition if more room is desired
at any time in the feeding floor.-

GARDEN AND ORCHARD.
POULTRY for the plum and hogs feo
the apple orchard.
TREEs should never crowd one an
other in the orchard.
lMlAKE the garden long enough to
work handily with a team.
IN pruning remember that diseased
wood will never become sound.
ANNUAL manuring of the orchard
I will help in securing annual crops of
fruit.
A mEE that has plenty of room to
grow naturally needs very little trim

Ir a tree makes a slow growth it is
advisable to cut back the shoots a lit.
tie in the spring.
SUNLIHonT is absolutely necessary to
the health and growth of the tree and
the production of good fruit.
IT is a mistake to set trees in or
around the garden. The vegetables
need all light and sunshine possible.
INJU Y from borers can be prevented
to some extent by placing a mound of
coal ashes around the stem of the trees.
Arran pruning the grape gather up
all the prunings, old decayed leaves
and other rubbish in the vineyard anl

Mon benefit will be derived from
burying bones near grape vines, if care
is taken to break them up fine befor.

SWhat is endive and how is it grownal
I we are asked. Its leaves make a splen
did salad when properly blanched, and
one that is very useful, as it comes in
r after lettuce is gone. It may be grown
r at any season, but is usually grown for
use late ih the fall. For an early crop
sow in April, in drills 15 inches apart,
a and later on thin out to 18 inches in the
S rows. It can also be sown-in beds and
V transplanted to the above distance after
. attaining sufiient, size. The maih
, sowings are made in June and July
Ordinary good soil and cultivation is
Sall it requires. When nearly full
Sgrown it is blanched in the following
Smanner: Gather up the leaves and tie
them by their tips in a conical f~rm,
a thereby excluding the light and air
from their inner leaves, which then
blanch to a beautiful, yellowish white.
r Thin process takes two to five weeks,
* according to the temperature, bleach
- ing fastest in warm weather. An
other method is to lay clean boards
right over the plants which excludes
the air and light. -.Tie up at different
times ae it only keeps a short time
after blanching. For winter use take
up with earth and store in frames or a
dry cellar. One ounce sows 100 feet of
