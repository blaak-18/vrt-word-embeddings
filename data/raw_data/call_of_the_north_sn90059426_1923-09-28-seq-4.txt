KLAN LECTURER PELTED
WITH “LOVE-APPLES”
-K-K
Stillwater Ruffians Started Something That
They Didn’t Finish.
wnen xwnigm, uru uwu
speaking a few minutes a volley of
tomatoes was directed towards his
head, one tomato hitting the Klan
speaker on his breast. Mr. Om had
just finished the statement “The par
ochial school is the most mistaken
institution in America today” when
the “guns” of the enemy unlimbered
and went into action. This barrage
the speaker ignored entirely and went
on as if nothing unusual had taken
place.
Klan investigators moved rapidly
through the crowd and found bulging
pockets quite numerous. It was evi
dent that a canningfactory had been
previously robbed in order to supply
ammunition for the ruffians. The
speaker was signalled to rapidly close
his lecture, but it seemed, refused to
be easily frightened. Mr. Om went
an with blissful indifference of care
fully planned attacks. Shortly an
other volley of “love-apples” filled the
air around the lecture platform, this
time several “shot” took effect. Mr.
Om now turned on the “heroic de
fenders of foreignism” and told them
that he wasn’t going to stop speak
ing until he finished his message, in
sisting that the rank and file of Still
water people were of the kind that
would stand for no actions if lawless
ness by organized dubs that happened
to live in the community. Then the
speaker impressed the following
staten.%nt: “There are so many
Klansmen in the audience that if I
were to tell you how many, you
wouldn’t believe me.” A dead silence
fell over the crowd. One of the in
vestigators of the Klan worked his
way into the Kowardly Columns and
beard them discuss ways and means
whereby they might be more dirty
and “gloriously tolerant.” One “low
brow,” obviously a parochial school
graduate, ventured the suggestion,
NEWSITES
FROM HERE AND THERE
Larimore, N. D.—Klan No. 2 of the
Realm of North Dakota was formally
organized here last week. The cere
mony took place about a mile north of
Larimore, the exercises being opened
by Rev. F. Halsey Ambrose, of Grand
Forks. About a thousand Klansmen
were present from towns adjacent to
Larimore, a goodly proportion of them
being from Grand Forks.
K-K-K
San Antonio, Tex.—The Ku Klux
Klan held a big barbacue and public
initation here this week, when it is
said approximately 2,500 candidates
were initiated into the “Invisible Em
pire’ in the presence of a large crowd
of visitors. A large sum was realized
from the sale of tickets, which was
turned over to the San Antonio
Protestant Orphans’ home.
K-K-K-
Douglas, Wyo.—Three thousand
people witnessed the initiation cere
mony of the Ku Klux Klan staged
here last week at the Wyoming state
fair grounds. The event took place
on the day before the last of the fair,
and although it was reported that
Governor Ross had said he would not
permit the ceremony at the fair
grounds, there was no interference
with the meeting.
K-K-K-
Muskogee, Okla.—Will Richardson,
candidate for mayor of Wapanucka,
Johnson county, on an anti-Ku Klux
Klan ticket, is under arrest charged
with looting freight cars, according
to Homer Watson, of this city, special
agent for the Kansas, Oklahoma and
Gulf railway. He was apprehended
at Atoka selling commodities alleged
to have been stolen from the com
pany’s car at Wapanucka last week.
K-K-K
Burlington, la.—(Special) Bur
lington Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
have promised the other Klans of
lowa that Burlington is going to have
the largest and most active Klan in
the state in proportion to population.
Here is Burlington’s motto:
United we Stick
Divided we’re Stuck
The Tighter we Stick
The Better we KLUCK.
K-K-K-
Stubenville, o.—New interest was
added to the mayoralty contest here
when Herman Passavant, understood
to be a Ku Klux Klan member, an
nounced his candidacy on an indepen
dent ticket. He stated that he was
not a candidate brought forward by
the Klan, but was supported by “citi
zens who want the laws upheld.”
Passavant formerly was a member
■of the city council. He is a grandson
of the founder of the Passavant hos
pital in Pittsburgh. The entry of
Passavant into the field makes the
race three-cornered. The present
mayor, Frank Hawkins, is the Repub
lican candidate, and James Keane, the
Democratic. In the primaries, held
August 14, a Klan candidate, Albert
Truman Smith, opposed Hawkins for
the Republican nomination, but was
defeated. Smith, a teacher in the
high school, resigned and left town.
“Let’s all throw at once from every
side.” Someone decided that caution
m ight be inorder adding that “it is
possible the speaker is telling the
truth about there being hundreds of
night-shirters in the crowd.” The
“Kub Cats” then decided definitely
to behave themselves, more than a
difficult thing to do.
About a month ago the Mayor of
Stillwater, Mr. Coffeen, stopped a
Klan lecture after some hedging.
Then Stillwater Klansmen became
more determined than ever to fight
for the right of free-speech and. rent
ed private property for a public lec
ture on the principles of the Ku Klux
Klan. Wednesday, a week ago, her
alds appeared on the street advertis
ing a Klan lecture for the next day.
At once persistent rumors went the
rounds pointing to possible attempts
of violence in an effort to stop the
lecture. Klan officials gave little con
sideration to these rumors. When
Mr. Orn didn’t appear at the time set
for the meeting many thought that
something must have happened in
line with the rumors. About 2,000
people were waiting for the Klan lec
turer somewhat impatiently. Then
Mr. Om appeared on the scene and
with the least possible delay went
into the action.
Outside of the flurriers during the
first fifteen minutes of the lecture,
the meeting went on as well as one
could wish. Mr. Om was at his best
and for more than an hour held the
large throng in a most remarkable
way. Cheers and applause were fre
quent and spontaneous, revealing a
general acceptance of the Klan prin
ciples.
After the lecture Mr. Orn was ap
proached and said, “I wish my ad
vanceman had told the ruffians that
I like eggs much better than toma
toes.”
FARIBAULT SEES IT
FIREMEN PUT OUT
FIERY KLAN CROSS
Faribault firemen last night per
formed the unusual task of extin
guishing a fiery cross of the Ku Klux
Klan.
The flaming emblem of the hooded
order was burning on East Second
street bridge and residents of the vi
cinity called out the fire fighters who,
anticipating a burning house, found
the cross which they threw in the
river.
A second cross was burned on the
bluffs below St. Mary’s hall, about
7:30 p. m., and was watched by hun
dred of downtown pedestrians for
over 15 minutes. The cross was con
structed of wood and oil-soaked rope,
which gave a brilliant illumination.
K. K. K. SET FIERY
jCROSS NEAR FAIR
Demonstration Put On Friday Eve
ning in Sterling’s Pasture.
A fiery cross, the emblem of the
Ku Klux Klan, blazed in Lew Ster
ling’s pasture last Friday evening
right after the fireworks at the county
fair. Mrs. M. C. Grant noticed two
men come out of the pasture and told
them to close the gate after them,
or the cattle would get out. One of
the men got out of the car and closed
the gate. They were dressed in plain
clothes and gave no evidence of the
usual Klan regalia.
The people at the fair were sur
prised when they saw this large cross
flaring in the sky. Two two by fours
about twenty feet long were nailed to
gether and some crossbars were nail
ed to this. The cross was then raised
and three cans of kerosene were used
to saturate the wood and cause the
flames.
Who the men were who built and
erected the cross and where they went
is unknown. As far as we are able
to learn there is no Klan organiza
tion in Waseca.—Waseca Journal.

that the chief executive of the state
has been guilty of specific violations
of the laws and constitution of the
state.”
All three statements were signed by
the same men.
Called by Tulsa Editor
The meeting today was called by
Victor Barnett, managing editor of
the Tulsa Tribune, after conferences
extending over several days with edi
tors throughout the state. Mr. Bar
nett presided.
The public address follows:
“The Governor of Oklahoma, J. C.
Walton, has invoked martial law for
the entire state of Oklahoma, pro
claiming that a state of insurrection
and rebellion against the laws and
constitution and constituted authori
ties of Oklahoma does exist within
and throughout the state of Okla
homa.
“This declaration must not go un
challenged. We, the undersigned edi
tors of daily newspapers in Oklaho
ma, make the following statements to
the people of the United States.
Libel Against State
“The governor’s declaration is a
libel against the state of Oklahoma.
There has not been any riot, insur
rection nor rebellion in any part of
the state, nor have the civil authori
ties been defied or overthrown. No
group of citizens nor civil officers
have made a request for military
intervention.
“The criminal records qf counties
and cities in Oklahoma show that
there has been less crime during the
past year than in any year since the
war. Almost without exception the
communities of the state were as
peaceful and law-abiding as any nor
mal community in America when this
proclamation was issued. Since Au
gust 14, when martial law first was
invoked in Tulsa county, the forces of
the National Guard have not been
used in a, single instance to quell any
riot or civil commotion.
“Governor Walton by his own acts
has attempted to nullify rights guar
anteed under our Constitution and to
halt the lawful processes of repub
lican government.”
“First, he has stationed armed
guards before the legislative chambers
at the state capitol to prevent the
Legislature from peaceably assembl
ing and he has threatened to arrest
any legislators who attempt to as
semble and to keep them in jail dur
ing his term of office.
“Second, he has ordered the disso
lution of a grand jury which was
about to convene in a lawful manner
for purpose of investigating some of
his official acts and he had a machine
gun trained on the grand jury room
of the courthouse.
Suspends Habeas Corpus Right
“Third, by his own flat he ordered
the writ of habeas corpus suspended,
although the constitution of the state
specifically declares that ‘the privilege
of the writ of habeas corpus never
shall be suspended by the authorities
of the state.’ The Federal Constitu
tion also guarantees this right to
American citizens.
“Fourth, he established censorship
over two newspapers and threatened
other newspapers with the same
treatment, thus suppressing the free
dom of the press, another fundamental
right guaranteed both by national and
state authorities.
“Fifth, he has ordered the military
forces to take over the courts and the
law enforcement branches of the civil
government in Tulsa and Oklahoma
counties, in conflict with decisions of
the state supreme court, which pro
vided that the military forces of the
state shall at all times be subordinate
to the civil authorities.
“Sixth, although posing as the
champion of law enforcement, he has
released from the State penitentiary
nearly three hundred convicts, includ
ing murderers, rapists, bandits and
lynchers, during the nine months of
hi§ administration. In some instances
criminals who have been tried, con
victed and in- our courts
were immediately freed when they
produced pardons or paroles signed by
the governor.
“These instances clearly indicated
Governor Walton’s espotic conception
of his executive powers. Under his
administration our visible or repub
lican form of government has been
set at naught, our civil courts sup
planted by cilitary inquisitorial bodies,
our officers of the peace replaced, our
grand jaries charged with ferreting
oat crime disbanded under the threat
of machine gun fire, and our legisla
ture forbidden at the l point of bayo
nets to assemble peaceably.”

THE CALL OF THE NORTH
30,100 LOUDLY
CHEER KLANSMEN
Jacksonville, Fla.—Thirty thousand
people cheered wildly as members of
the Ku Klux Klan paraded through
the busines section of Jacksonville
last week, and 5,000 others applauded
the 200 new members initiated later
in the evening at the baseball park.
There was no repetition of the un
warranted Klan attacks at Perth Am
boy, N. J.,0 and Carnegie, Pa., and no
disorders were reported to the police.
The crowds who packed the streets
along the line of march enthusiasti
cally clapped their hands as the Klans
men passed by.
“Professional gamblers must go,”
was written on one of the banners
carried by the Klanmen. S “We believe
in law enforcement; clean politics;
marriage vows must be respected by
both persons; we believe in white
supremacy; K. K. K. letters must bear
Klan seal; free public schools; the
eighteenth amendment must be en
forced; confidence men must go; se
paration of church and state; and
free speech;” were on other signs in
the parade.

Walton’s “Siege of Tulsa”
The following clever article was
printed in a Tulsa, Okla. paper after
martial law had been declared there
by Governor Walton without cause ex
cept in an attempt to discredit the
Knights of the Klan:
And it came to pass that there
were floggings in the land of Tulsa
and the mighty Jack who ruleth su
preme, spake unto jhis general, say
ing: “Mark, they have been pullin’
some ‘ruff stuff over on the East Side
and as Commander-in-Chief of the
army and navy I command thee to
proceed thither—lay siege to the city
and depart not until thou hast secur
ed a Klux to the Klan that is doing
the dirt.” Mark saluated .nd remark
ed: “Master, thou knowest thy prunes
exceedingly well and before the sun
shall have gone down on another day
thine army shall ‘be entrenched on
the ‘Eastern front.’ ” Like Kaleb of
old, Mark sallied forth at the head of
his army and while the sun was still
high in the heavens on the second
day of the siege, he led his gallant
men to a room with bath. Then the
men. who beat the man who had beaten
his wife and torn the book were
brought before the high court accused
of riot. Their counsel, a man learned
in the law, spake unto “Your Honor,”
saying: “I am for my government;
I am for my country and against any
invisible empire within the confines if
our country. * * * The boys are
guilty but not most guilty and I ask
for mercy upon them.” Then Jack
spake unto Mark, saying: “Good
work, thou knowest thy merchandise
and before our reign shall have ended,
we will show these birds that they
ain’t nothin’ we can’t do.”

A fOOL THERE WAS
The Ku Klux Klan is whining be
cause one of its leaders in Pennsyl
vania has been “murdered” by a mob.
The family of the poor, prejudiced
devil who was killed by the Carnegie
mob deserves sympathy, but his as
sociates in the Klan deserve none.
The leaders of the mob which attack
ed them ought to be punished, as a
process of orderly government, but
the Klan has merely reaped what it
has dbwn. Violence begets violence.
They who take up the sword shall
perish by the sword.—Faribault Daily
News.
A fool there was, and he pounded
a typewriter in an editorial sanctum.
We didn’t think there was a man serv
ing as editor in Minnesota that would
make an effort to justify murder.
Note the quotation marks around the
word “murder.” Obviously an effort
is being made in the editorial to make
the killing of Tom Abbott by a craz
ed Roman Catholic an act worthy of
applause. The statement contained
in the editorial asserting that the
leaders of the mpb ought to be pun
ished, is entirely out of line with the
rest of the editorial. It was merely
slipped in to give a possible complex
ion of reason to the prattle of ignor
ant hate. That the editor of the
“Faribault Daily News” is absolute
ly ignorant when it comes to Klan
craft stands without argument. He
reminds us of the kindergartner who
attacked the Einstein theory. No
body paid any attention to the child
for it went without saying that ig
norance spatters piffle.
SOLONS SAY DEFEAT
IS TEMPORARY
Oklahoma City, Okla.—The Okla
homa legislature has not given up its
fight to convene for the impeachment
of Gov. Walton, acording to a “war
bulletin” issued this afternoon by
Rep. Mcßee.
Mcßee’s statement made immedi
ately after the legislature had obeyed
the military order to disperse follows:
“About 7 members of the house of
representatives, feeling it their duty
to convene to restore constitutional
government in Oklahoma to take the
place of a condition of despotism,
have met the enemy by convening
with a duly elected speaker pro tern,
and temporarily 'we are theirs.’
“We realize our constitutional
rights are in the balance just as did
our forefathers in 1776. We feel that
our cause is just and we will carry
on. Never in the history of the
American republic has such complete
dictatorship been established and car
ried on to such extent as now prevails
in the once fair state of Oklahoma.
“There is more to follow.”
A DRAMATIC MOMENT
A dramatic moment in the Ku'ldux
Klan demonstration that brought a
heavy round of applause occurred
when King Kleagle Gross, just before
the beginning of the initiation cere
monies announced to the “bootleg
gers” in the audience that the Klan
was definitely on their trail. “If the
officers need help* iff locating you vio
lators of a constitutional law, they
shall have it from the Klan, and al
ready we have an amazing amount of
evidence against the ilicit moonshine
peddlers who are selling . their vile
stuff to the booze hounds of Austin
and vicinity,” he said, but when the
Klan cracks down on law violators it
does it hard.” “We are not disposed
to stand on the sidelines and do
nothing while the honest man works
hard for a living and the bootlegger
breaks the law and cleans up a for
tune,” said the state officer to a re
porter after the meeting.—Austin
Herald.
KLANIiND RADICALISM
If the Ku Klux Klan is the thor
ough American organization it claims
to be, it is overlooking a good bet in
not putting the iron heel on the “in
visible empire” down on the neck of
red radicalism and in not using its in
fluence to prevail upon the adminis
tration to ceae liberating seditionists
and trators from prison. Why attempt
to swallow a camel and gag at a
gnat? Radicalism is the one great
menace to our national progress and
if the K. K. K. can help stamp it out,
the job is cut out for it. You can’t
make a desirable citizen out of dis
loyalist through coddling, any more
than you can make a suitable play
mate for a baby by petting a rattle
snake. —St. James Independent.
In America today there is no or
ganization that 'is as effectively com
bating “red” radicalism, as the Ku
Klux Klan. With the Klan in Ameri
ca there is no danger of our govern
ment being overthrown by the “pink
ist,” for the Invisible Empire is mil
itantly on the job and ever watchful.
The greatest danger in this country
today is not the wild ranter advocat
ing violent revolution, but the indif
ferent citizen. The Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan are arousing Ameri
cans to the point of real constructive
interest in all matters of government.
Any person who will read Klan pub
lications will find that careful investi
gations are continuously being made
in order to keep accurately in touch
with conditions. We seek to be al
ways forwarned knowing that when
we are forarmed.—EDlTOß.
