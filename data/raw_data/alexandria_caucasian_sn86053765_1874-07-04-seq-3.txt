of a high United States Court, hon
ored and respected when he lirst
came; aud having the full conti
dence of our people, that ho would
give them justice—and they asked
no more*—lending himself to a vile
persecution of innocent inen, drag
ging the »pötless ermine he brought
here in the very filth and mire, dis
pensing one side justice, while he
was reeking with the sceut of his
own pollution; prostituting the law
to the gratification of an unwarrant
ed hate; making law, justice and
right bend, unwilling victims, to the
assertion of negro supremacy over
the white man, and even glorying
in the sense of his own moral degra?
dation. Behold this partisan Judge
playing cards jvith a vile political
associate, while for all ho knew
the lives of eight men were at stake
in another room ! See him arro
gant, insolent and vile, as he sits
an unfit representative of the majes
ty of the law, and a disgrace and
foul blot upou the sanctity of the
precincts where justice holds her
court, and when equity challenges
your respect, and you know that
his name is WOODS.
See now : A calm, dignified gen

of his own möral rectitude, high
above all party considerations;
HCOvt,, "Z to lend himself to party
persecution and daring to " do right
though the heavens should fall,"
and with such .a regard for the
sanctity of his oath, and such, re

Some Figures for "Looker On."
We have polished the couimuni
cation of "Looker On" a colored
man, just as it canto into our bauds
t h<> p os t Office. We do hot
know who lie is, but would be glad
to hear from him or any otiiérs of
the colored people, as often as they
may choose to send as sych sensi
ble letters as this one. He
is mistaken iu one tliiu^,' we have
nevdr said, nor do we believe, that
all the negroes are "thieve»." But
we have said aud we tell "Looker
On" that we can prove that the re
presentativo meu of his race who
havejbeeu put forward, are as cor
rupt as the carpet-baggers and
have come pretty near, if not quite,
all been thieves. W q want to give
"Looker On" and the honest color
ed people he represents a few fig
ures to work on. flow could Har
ry Lott make money enough hon
estly, at $8 00 a day for sixty days,
to b u,y a plantation ? $480 iu
State warrants and about §200 in
mileage"would not buy a very big
plantation «ml support a man and
his family in New Orieans besides,
would it jiow, "Looker On !"
And how could Kelsoat the same
wageshonestly make money enough
to go into the Commission business,
«port fine clothes, drive fast horses,
wear big diamond pins and a big
■gold watch, drink champagne,
smoke fiue cigars, buy and set up a
newspaper, and besides all this—
loo.sc twenty thousand dollars in one
year buying cotton ? Couldn't do
it on $680 State Warrants, could
he now "Looker On !" 4 And how
could Mayo make enough in one
session at the same figures, to buy
and improvfc a lot in town' for five
hundred dollars in greenbacks? He
had to live pretty close, didn't he
now, "Looker On?" What we blame
you lor is putting such men in-of
fice. Now on the other hand we
will tell you of one honest colored
man you have had iu office, whom
we respect as such, aud that is Jes
sie Clifton iu the Police Jury. We
are rather afraid of your other man,
Bill Kelso, because he is a brother
of George's and George may have
put him up to tricks, but Bill if left
to himself would be all right, we
believe. Wo have watched Jessie
closely for three years, and if yon
will put up such men as he is and
fairly elect them to offices whose
duties they.can understand, we will
not have a word to say, "Looker
On," but will protect them in their
right to hold them.
Write again, "Looker Ou," this
is a question in which the whites
and blacks are all interested, and
the Caucasian so far from seeking
or wishing to do your race any'in
justiee, is anxious for us all to come
to some amicable understanding
about this thing and our columns
are always open to such of yon as
sincerely desire to return to au hon
«

ernment, for an expression of your
views. You will always find a
ready encouragement at our hands.

A Homicide.
On last Saturday evening a ne
gro whose name We believe is Lew
is Garty, was shot and killed on the
road a few miles troiu town by Hi ll
Nestor. We have made diligent
enquiry and can fiiui nobody who
is able to enlighten us as to the
.facts. As we understand if, the
parties were alone, and were in a
wagon where the difficulty arose.
What the provocation was or wheth
er Nestor, who was then and for
(jpme time past, a resident of Grant
Parish, was justifiable in the act,
we know not. -But this much we
do know, that for his sake if justi
fiable and iu either case for the
good of this community, white and
black, he ought to have been ar
rested and been held l'or a prelimi
nary examination. That he was
O
not, is tlie fault of our Radical Slier
ig, John DeLacy, who was inform
ed of the facts a short time after
O
the killing, and who had ample
time to have overtaken Nestor, be
fore he could have gotten off very
far. Whether it was because ho
was afraid to follow him, or because
iu his opinion the killing of a negro
was too small a matter to bother
about, we don't know, nor do we
care, for iu either case he is equally
reprehensible ; but certain it is that
he took no adequate steps to catch
Nestor, and as we are informed, in
* Q
stead of going bimself^'uo placed
the warrant iu the hands of two
negroes, shifting the danger and
responsibility on to them.
The negroes here may.be assured
ôf one fact, that if the choice of the
white people, Captain David C.
Paul, had been in the office to
which ho was fairly-- elected, iind
John DeLacy been building houses
where he belonged, not on I y
this youn$ man would have been
arrested, but every other law-break
er would be promptly arrested ;
been on the bench to which he was
fairly and honestly elected, and'
John Orsborn had been ditching
somewlfere, a work alone suited to
his capacity, they w o ti 1 d al
ways have found protection at his
hands. They all know this as well
as we do.
We have written this in no spirit
of condemnation of the young gen
tleman who has so uufortunately
stained his hands with blood, be
cause we really are utterly ignorant
of the facts, and he may have been
perfectly justifiable for all we know
to the contrary; if so, he ought to
have stood his trial.
Aiî îacendiary Article.
We publish below an editorial ar
ticle; from the New Orleans Repub
lican, so incendiary in its terms and
so menacing and insulting to the
white people ot Grant and adjoiii:
ing parishes, that we desire to pre
serve it, in order that when just
such teachings have borne their le
gitimate fruit and the ignorant but
insolent negroes ot Colfax have
again lorged upon the whites of
that parish a conflict for the safety
of their lives and property, and
what is dearer than both, the hon
or of their females, the responsibili
ty may be placed where it belongs.
An article from this same Journal
just before the last riot there, stat
ing that the negroes were well arm
ed and prepared to whip out the
whites, did more than any other one
thing to bring about that trouble,
and if there should be disturbances
there again, th qRepublican and Kel
logg, the Usurper," will be respon
ble for it
When the American people admitted
the negroes to the rights of citizenship,
that of keeping nnd bearing arms was
inclndeJ. This is a 1 ight which the
constitution says shall not be infringed.
But from the scare which has recently
been created by tho purchase of fire
arms by some of the colored people
when about to return to the conntry^
it may be fairly inferred that the cou
serV ativo whites of this State expect to
monopolize all tho lights confered by
this section. There is no more terror
in the fact that a negio has armed him
self in self-defense than there is in the
fact that a white man has done so for
the same reason, or for purposes of ag
gression perhaps. But it is an indica
tion of something wrong in the social
or political system. If there is any sig
nificance* in the circumstance at all, it
ig that tiie negroes, deeming the pro
Section of the law, as administered by
Louisiana juries, insufficient for the
p u ,-p 0se> | ia Vc resolred to invest a part
of their earnings in powder and shot.!
They have as clear a right to do this as !
ilie white man, aud it is hardly posai
'ble that they will be less discreet iu the;
use of arms. Sf there is no belter way j
jto ptottel til»' Ines vi defrti seiet« ein- ;
mÊmm
zens than a resort to thé means afford
ed by nature and aft, w« may wxpect
them to bv adopted. . We have little
fear,however, that these arms WITT ftv'er
lie required. Their possessors are not
very likely to be annoyed so long as it
is known ihéy are prepared. We rare
ly hear of ncprovoked assaults upon
those who known to lie ready.
. We do not ktipw how far this arming
process lias extended ; it may be con
fined to a very few localities or it may
he general. - So long as we concede to
one party the privilege of keeping
arms, with «1 nearly perfect certainty
that tliey wUl he used, we cannot deny
to those menaced by the practice of the
saipn libwty. Perhaps the peucemnK
era with the percussion locks are the
most effectual that can be employed-.—
Severe remedies are some times the
most efficacious. And if the negroes
choose to arm themselves we know of,
no way to prevent it short of a general
disarming of their sworn enemies. We
believe it is custoniary*among the na
tions <if Europe to insist upon a mutu
al laying down of arms, since if one
side were to throw away their gun's
while the others retained theirs, there
would be an obvious advantage and a
great temptation (o improve it. The
theory of the defease in the Grant par
ish trial lias been that a sott of war ex
isted at tho time of the. massacre. The
jury doubtless felt the influence of the
appeal to some extent, and tho -colored*
peop.e see no other recourse fur safety
than a litttè timely préparation for Hie
next campaign. We ho|»e there will be
no occasion to use these gnus, but that
is a question which the 'superior race'
must décidé for themselves. The ne
groes will never make an attack, and
their guns will be harmless in their
hands unless the tinners are put iu

Prospects seem pretty fair for a season
of extreme low water; then "kick up
