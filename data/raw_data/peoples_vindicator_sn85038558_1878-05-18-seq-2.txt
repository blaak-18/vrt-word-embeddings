"Tray, Blanche and Sweetheart." can
tall
When man, individually becomes lizE
subservient, his character is abhorred am
by all that is virtuous, but when a for,
Press, supposed to be-and very pro- r
perly-the free exponent of popular doi
sentiment, tamely submits to, acqui- c
eses in, or defends that which it er
knows to te wrong in principle, a pat
most deplorable condition of affairs me
can be said to exist. are
The true power of the press lies in ica
its independence, while perhaps its me
pecuniary advantages are the other an
way. Since the foundation of the ma
VINDICATOR it has been the earnest km
and outspoken advocate of Demo- be
cratic principles'; principles which re- shc
quire independence of thought and ac- vot
tion to successfully champion. These 1
fundamental faiths reside not in men mo
-they are eternal, and when we see Co,
our efforts ansailsld y jouZuale, uu- rra
worthy the name, we lose hope, exi
almost, in our cause.
Because the VINDICATOR saw fit to fro
criticise the action of the Supreme sal
Court in the matter of Tom Ander- for
son-because we were outspoken th
against the treason of Democrats in tai
the General Assembly to Democratic po
principles and pledges, we have been rig
attacked by every weak, cowardly and tic
pusilanimous penny-a-liner within po
the borders of our Commonwealth. tir
Power has always had its courtiers. the
Even the rude Kings of African hordes at
are surrounded by subservient and w(
applauding minions. The defender ar<
of baseness; of treason, has his ex- or
cuse in the nature of man, and his tl
example in history. The satellites of of
power that defended Jefferies had tl
their example from those who ap m
plauded Trisilian. A powerful, un- pa
answered and unanswerable writer rin
very justly said, "Some men are wil- ez
"ling to take law upon trust. They 1
"rely upon the authority of the Chief m
"Justice, because they are too indo- es
"lent to search for information; or, ti
"conceiving that there is some mys
"tery in the laws of their country, te
"which lawyers are only qualified to at
"explain, they distrust their judg- w
"ment, and renounce the right of w
"thinking for themselves. th
Were these men in the majority, it re
would be an unhappy hour for man
kind, and had their authority been as er
vast as their assumed erudition, liber- qi
ty had never been born, or been stran- ac
gled in its cradle. m
Liberty lies in free speech, and re
those who denounce the criticism of
public men are either unwittingly or
purposely the tools of power. When
this acquiesence, which is demanded W
of as, becomes the rule, we will have
reached the grave of freedom and
mounted the crown of infamy.
Courts and learned jurists haveb
ever been the easy tools of tyrants.
During every hour of Louisiana's
Iony-and her eight years of Radi
eslism is without parallel-her task- a
masters could rely for defenders from i
among the foremost members of her
bar, while "Ludeling's Court" will
live in infamy, nichbed as high as the a
Star Chamber of Charles I. To an
Executive, clothed with the power of
an anutoerat; ruiding under a centrali- d
sinag and centralized Constitution, as p
we have in our State, tgislatures will f
always be subservient; the General ,
Assembly of 1877-78, were treache
roos to the people because the Execu
tive was clothed with more power ft
than the people. f
We firmly believe with that philo- n
sophio statesman, Edmund Burke, ti
that nature cannot be so changed but P
that public liberty will be among us, a
as among our ancestors, obnoxious to
some person or persons; that oppor- I
tonities will be furnished, and sought 5
for, to attempt some alteration to the a
prejudice of our inherent rights. t
"For ambition," says this wonderful
man, "though it has ever the same
general views, has not at all times 0
the same means nor the same particu- t
lar objects." Radicalism bas left the
slime of its teaching on the bosom of i
our people, and we see evidences all 5
arenad us that centralism is deeper I
meated than we will adinit, andthat '
power has votaries more numerous
than we will allow. .
However that may be-and truth it
is-the VINDICATOR proPoseas to fl- i
l its mission unawed by the frowns '
of ittle greatnsms, and unterrified by
the whelps of "Tray, Blanche andd
Sweetheart." We are for full rights I
to the people, for liberty in the truei
semnm of the word; we are a wor- i
shiper ofpriCipfe, and such being the
faith within us the assanlts of sub
servients are like the idle wind.

WHY
The Amendments Should be Defeated. 8S
Dec
The abortive efforts of the legislature CU
of 1878, in the shape of Constitutional wl
amendments, have few if any defon- tiga
ders. It seems their advocacy is left o
to a few implacable of fossils who have the
rioted beyond their day and genera
tion and are a terror to all people be- he I
cause of their interminable, idiotic ob
talk. Public sentiment has crysta- he,
lized in democratic quarters on the thik
amendments, and their defeat is a cral
foregone conclusion. itie
Nor is it proposed to vote them tab
down simply without cause. viti
Something in their nature lies deep- ed
er than the surface. That they are in 1
patchwork upon an infamous gar-. of
ment, every one admits. That they cap
are the Lirth of a combination of rad- wil
icals, thieves monopolists and weak tod
men, no one denies. That they are cou
an insolent answer to the just do- Ha:
mands of an outraged people all ac- war
knoweldge. But there is something he I
beyond them which demands that we ori
should promptly and emphatically cob
vote them down. tie
We said a foe weeks since and }{ a
most emphatically, that the present and
Constitution of Louisiana was a e- offl,
trazc;a organic law. We repeat that Del
expression with renewed emphasis. 1
The people, it's true, suffer in purse the
from the many officials and their.high wit
salaries which it orders, but they suf- Do
for more in principle from the fact Pe'
that that infamous instrument cur- Vu
tails, restricts and strikes down their ma
power. It invades their inherent oui
rights and rudely grasps their liber- PDI
ties. The executive exercises the
power of autocrat, while the legisla- Pb
tive branch of the government usurps
the remainder of the people's rights pu
at will and unrestrained. Perhaps it
i would be well to say here, that we
r are not attacking Governor Nicholls er
or the Assembly of 1878, and we say cy
B this for the benefit of a large margin dm4
f of implacable asses who don't know
I the principles of their own govern- to
ment, and yet pretend to edit news
- papers. We are now speaking of the
r rights of a people and the powers of de
executive.
y Ale there any words in these amend
f ments which strikes at this, the great
. est evil which the bayonet Constitu- ne
tion inflicts ? Not one! to
Here then is the greatest, most po- by
tent reason wnv we should defeat the ac
o amendments. A people are not al- gr
ways right, but we are one of those
,f who believe that they will rectify 8o
their errors, while rulers will never try
retrace. A great writer has said : -
When the people do wrong it is their sh
error and not their crime, and it is ty
quite different with rulers. They
act ill as much from design as by
mistake, to them therefore, we had m
rather not trust. th
All power, not incompatible with er
r public safety and individual protection, ot
should be lodged where it belongs-- or
d with the people. No legislature ci
should legislate away the liberties of re
a people as can be done under our fl
present constitution. Vide "Return- ti
ing Board law." Noexecutive should pm
'be allowed, by an immense patron- st
age, in the way of high salaried of- vy
Sficers, to build his personal power al
over that of his masters. These pi
Samendments restrict not the one nor i
acurtail the other, and with a patch- I
Swork, a thing of shreds, we are left ti
still at the mercy of man's ambition 0
e and man's cupidity. k
n The PEOPLE understand the evil p
'' d they know the remedy. It is in
Sdefeating all compromises with their it
Sprinciples, and in forcing their rights v
ll frorp the hands of those who now is
Sretain them under the forms of law. al
- What's in a man never shines or i
r fades except when he stands face to i
face with an issue. Smooth sailing- b
Sno wind-all calm, never brings outh

a war in Europe and a good pair of
to scissors, it's clean work, and no effort.

Sat present we are having a rush of a

soutraged people on the other, and

[ banged with the staffed clubs, at every

a readychinned to death. They talked

it "honorables" returned home, then I
l- they "reacted," while now they
n whine, "that if we attempt a vigorous

a to the falfillment of the pledgee made
a. to the people, it will "cause a split

ja let the party split, In that event the
a weak and dishonest elements,"for
whose sins of omission and commie

The Conservatire is about one year

noble work for it. Now, it's singular
that no one ever heard of the Carroll
