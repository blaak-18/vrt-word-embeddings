THE ROBBER.
(By Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie.)
Struggling against a robber,, I awoke;
He beat me down, and from my grasp
he broke.
My jewels and my money all were
gone.
The fruits from years of bitter labor
drawn.
I wept and cried to God in my despair;
An angel dazed me with celestial glare.
I saw upon his face my weapon’s
mark—-
It was with God I’d struggled in the
dark.
This vision none could steal from out
my heart.
And through my loss I’d found the bet
ter part.

CORPORATION EVILS.
(From Moody’s Magazine.)
There is no question but that the
people want these evils reformed. It
is because President Roosevelt has
made efforts to right some of these
wrongs that he is popular with the
people. It is because Hearst and
Bryan and Tom Johnson and Gov. Folk
and Senator La Follette promise to
make radical reforms that they have
any standing in the political arena. It
is hardly possible that the present dis
content will be allayed until some of
the great fundamental wrongs are
righted. It behooves the party in
power to do the work that the people
want done.

A TRUE PRESIDENT.
(Address by Woodrow Wilson.)
“The president alone is elected by
the people as a whole, has no local
constituency, speaks for no special in
terest. If he truly interpret the na
tional thought and boldly enough in
sist upon it he is irresistible and the
country never feels the zest of action
so much as when its president is of in
sight and caliber. Its instinct is for
unified action and it craves a single
leader. It is becoming inclined to
choose a man rather than a party.”

THE OFFICE HOLDER.
Upon the stump he tells the crowd
He longs to do them good.
He’d labor all his life for them
Most gladly, so he would.
But when at last he gets a job
He doesn’t go to work.
Instead, he lays his duties on
A hungry looking clerk.
His secretary writes the speech
By which he wins applause
A corporation often shapes
His notion of the laws.
He doesn’t do a thing, nor does
He ever earn a cent,
And yet, you’d think it very hard
To be so prominent.
—Paul Cook.

BY ONE’S FINGER PRINTS.
The system of identification by
means of finger prints now in use in
the New York police department,
wither it was imported from France,
is now on trial in the United States
army, and if it proves effective will
probably be permanently accepted.
TOM LAWSON DID IT.
(The Atlanta Georgian.)
Nevada-Utah stock went down with
a crash- Tuesday, and under the ruins
were the lambs, small traders, men
and women who had followed the
apostle of honesty not wisely but too
well. And Tom Lawson stood afar
off, adding more millions to his bank
account and chuckling to himself.
THE WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
THE HOOSIERS AND SUNDAY.
Another attempt to repeal the law
against Sunday baseball was made by
the Indiana legislature. As regularly
as this body meets, does this bill bob
up and as often is defeated. It is safe
to safe it will be a good many years
before that state will legalize profes
sional bail on the first day of the week.

NO BIBLES THERE.
Begging pardon, but it is said that
a gentleman once innocently asked a
native Kentuckian whether Kentucky
was not a rather bibulous state, and
the reply came promptly: “Sorry to
say, sir, it’s not. I’ve been through
whole townships and haven’t found
a single Bible in ’em.”

ABOUT NEW BOOKS.
(Book Notes.)
The venerable Mrs. Braddon has
written another novel, “The White
House.” I should not advise our lit
erary president to buy it; he is not
its hero. Mrs. Braddon is the only liv
ing writer that has never mentioned
him.
“The Japanese women do not have
clubs and therefore they have babies.”
That is a syllogism of Mrs. G. Ad
am-Fisher in her new book, “A Wo
man Alone in Japan.” Her omitted
major premise, “women who have no
only partly true. Dead women haov
clubs have babies,” appears to be
only partly true. Dead women have no
clubs.

HEROISM.
(John B. Jones, Western Adocate.)
O, ’tis not heroic to enter the fight,
Knowing beforehand by exerting our
might
We surely will win in the end for the
right.
’T is heorism true to enter the fight
Determined, though losing, to still
spend our might—
To battle to the death, to die for the
right.
