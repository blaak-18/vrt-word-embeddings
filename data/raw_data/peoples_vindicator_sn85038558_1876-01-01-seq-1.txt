'jIi1Is 1s A NATI(OX.
MIr. Morton submitted the follow.
ing resolution :
Whereas, it is allehged that the late
1 election in Mississipi ,i for Inlembers
of Congress, State olfficers and menil
hers of the Legislature was character.
'ized by great fi'rauds, violence and in I
Itimidation, wherbhy the freedom of
the ballot was in a great measure
destroyed, a. reign of terror establi h
td, ballot-lhoxes stuffed, spurlious tick
ets imposed upon voters, so that n:
popular.' nmority of more than 2t6,000
\was overcoijme, aniI ill its place was:
given all apparenl t but firanndiulnt
majiority of more than 25,000, antd
Whliereas, ,i.Iio . ,i t ttnro thus
chosen will have the elect ion of a
Senator to represent that State in
this hidy, and
Whereas, if these allegatioiis ai
true, a great numbler of the citizens
of the United States have haid their
rights, under the Constitution and
laws of the lnited States, wickedly
violated, therefore
Resolrerd, That a: committee of fire
Senators he appoiinted by the Chair
to inivestigate the truth of the said 1
allegations and the circumstances at
tending the said electioi, witih power
to visit said State to make their in
re.tigations, to send for persons and i
- papers, and to use all necessary pre
I elss in the performance of their dn
ties. a:id toi make a report to the Seln
ate hefore the end of this session of
their investigations and findings.
At the request of Mr. Bayard, of i
Delaware, the resolution was laid l
over unitil to morrow.
Mlr. Morton also submitted the fol
fowing: :
Resolred b thie Senate, of the loutse
of Representarties concurring, That
the people of the United States con
stitute a nation, and are one people
in tile sense of national unity. il
Resolrcd, That the government of f,
the United States is not a compact It
between the States in their municipal s,
alnd corporate characters, but was
formled by tihe people of the United 1
States in their prinary capacity ; that tl
the rights of the States are defined n
and guaranteed by the Constitutioii, o
and not by any outside thedrv of {q
State sovereignty, and that the rights {
of the States can not be enlarged or 1
diminished except by a an utndnient tl
to the Constitution. ti
Resolved, That the rights of the si
States have the 'atne sanction and 1
security In "the Constitntion as Ilhe 04
rights and powerl of the National t
Government, and that lotial doi4'*
tic governoelnt bytfý .at' ei within
the limits of the Ctinstitu itish is aln
essential part of our free republican t
system. U
Ireaohled, That thd doctrine that a to
State has the right to secede from the bi
Union is incolsistent with the idea of el
litionality, is in conflict with the 01
spirit and structure of the Conistitn- ru
tion, antd should be regarded as hav- t
ing been forever extinguished by the go
suppression of the rebellion. tr
A CHIAPTER OF EARLY KIENTCCKT
IIIsTORo.-Capt Jack Jewett, Robiun a
Mosby, and Ben Bradshaw were I,
traveling from Virginia to Kentucky di
on horseback. Capt. Jewett was a {
large, fine.looking man, and a fair Ii
specimnen of tile kind of men that gave p
character to the period that embraces ti
thc euitly history of Kentucky. As so
the tliree riode along, tlheir attention
was attracted by angry words frlomrna
cablin on the roadside. Words were
suneceeded by blows, and Capt. Jew
ett said: "Let's ride up and see
what this fight is abouLt." T'hey gl
lopped ilup to the cadlin, where was a
mn an id his better half having ,a "set
to," andshel was getting the better
half of it.
"Hold m'y llorse," said Jewett, "and
I will teach thle---- a lesson lie will I
ihe:ei foiget." At one blow of his fi
fidt tihe man lay prostrato on the floot,
The good wife looked at lher husband d
a moment and then at Jewett And
then, reachingback she caughlt uip a
large, long-handled frying iptn ,and
let drive alt Jewett's lhead. T''he bot:
tom went out, and fie riim welnt
over his head and around his neck,
such was the force of the blow. D
All efiorts failing to get the remnant
of the frying pan frorit around Jew- tl
ett's neck, lie had to weair it about
tive miles on his road, and then a file 11
in the hands of a blacksmith released a
hin. We will not atop to point the li
moral.
THE KIND OF CARDS SilHE WANTED. t
-A smart-looking bty about twelve el
years old called into aL Detroit book- c
store yesterday and said his mother b
wanted some cards. The clerk sup- F
posed hlie meant playing cards, and ti
accordingly wrapped up a pack. The b
boy came back if thile course of half p
an hour, flnng tlie cards down, and 4
said,:. I
"Mother don't want tlhat kind-- 6
sh~s got five or six packs in the house
now: She wants.sonoh with marked
backa, so she. can deal lone hairts ti
and warm it to dad !"*
"The fllow iwho can't read . n¶an's ,
cliaraeter by looking at hiis Fites is t
no fellen at all," soliloquizei Big Jim. ,
*hlien yo1t see a man stlibiliu around e
with deried mund on litl toes, yon can l
.et it down that lie hasn't git uip in
liim. If he ltets thile mud come wiay
up his heel, youi can bet he can't earn
a dollars, day, for he's slow. If hlie's b
got dust on his bliites, lie's reckless j
and won't pay anything; bat if his :
bates catchl thie rays of the morning !

blasb6f gldry, then he is .bbdin to. a

Some Advice.
Now that the year of crops as w.ll
as general lifet is ended, it woild he
well for our farners: to ponder well
before they entcer into the next ye'"r':
'a rming oplra tiions. In this seallonl
iiof rahn, the minds of our ag.icuiltn
rdal frietnds will he in be(tter condition
to COTultiehnitd their situationi tihan at
any othe(r lite, or thti('e:oit that
the rst'n1. of Itheir theories antd sales
of prtd lce a:' ill tlheir haijs.
We t:ln trut;y say that c(otton and
its (eitur;e is the blessing as well
as the r',e of the Southern ltrnler
IL ltl .sint, whn itdutlh d in with
lmoderat ion, antil a curse when over
dotne. \We are well satisfied that all
our friends ill ni anit this as a true
iunt not to be gaiaosaid. Thiere are
laniy excuses ren rered by the farm
er for (ior crop0ip!iq himself witlh cot
ton, so many that it woubli be useless
to try and el lttier;ate Ihem. lint
these xcuses are all taillacies wlhen the
net gatis; are be!ilt conited and they
imtrn to losses. Now let our farliers
think for a ;tmoioient of the urianiy other
agricultural irodietiions tlit can be
~stnce4funlly grown with themi, and
when ha:rvicsted coinihiiiatl ready and
iproeitlalle sale. moreover that do not
require the labor thlat cotton does,
and that !briing money Io their purses
all the year round.
We do not propose to1condemnn the
cultivation of cotton but we argue
against so munch being raised. The
crop of 1875 is e(stimated at 4,100,000
bales; too much by over a million
and the reduced prhie shows ;t; It is
idle to say that "if we don't plant
cotton we cannot plant anything else
that will pay." But you can, anda
ldant things that will pay more. Sup
pose all our farmers of Natchitnchrs
agree to plant but 70 per cePnt of the
anud in cotton in 1875 as a cotton crop
for 1876, 50 per cent would be better,
and the 30 per cent of land in corn,
peas, berIns, rice, cane anti grasses.
Suppose they invest their money and
credit in cows, mares, and line hogs,
to e raised in pens and pastures as
they do profitably in the North and
V'est, not rangeit.a he "before the
war"--and then gr >tble beccause they
T-c-e.toterdta .: w 11W iRniln1 Imore i
,rofitable would that be to the counu
try at large as well as to the farmer
at home. Monucy avedr is money
nade as well as earned. We know I
a farmei in this parish who has mark
toed in this town 1500 pounds of buLt
ter this last year at an average price t
of 25 cents per pound and he fives
lixteen miles away. Does any one
.Oppose his supplies thd' nmfirket.
Not at all. We will say tilt, the
country people alto~ether furnish 15
I ioanunds liome, makiuig . 3 0O fronti
home dairies, and we venture to say
tha't not less than 10,000 Ioiunds of
Northern butter is broaught here and
oldI yearly, and sold at fromnt 35 to 60
cents per poind. Here is over forty
;ive hulindred tdollars to be made by
farmers wvthin the raduins of is
-market, and who will do it.
This is only one item, the amo i an
bb said oft rice, sugar, molasses, hay,
corn, pork, bacon, Inwf, poultry, eggs,
peas, beans, pumpkins, and other
.'irm produetions. Cannot our Grange
aIsociations bring this matter folly lt
tile minds of their memlbers. We
will do all in our power to advance
t for we feel tmore than assured that
money will flow to all thereby.
LIet at least 30 per cent less of the
:atton lands of 1875 Ip'lauidi next
year in cereals in addition to that, of I
lnst :ear. I? this shlould le done, the
zotton crop, although not as large will
be as folly renunmenirative arid that
tadded to the income of the hundred
other thingstha~ t will bie made, upon
the farm fo.i said and lhome cbr6flsmp.
tion will show to the practical fartm
er how money is made fiuruni:g with
oat this big ariry of cotton balhs anm
