A (IIOST OF THE SIERRAS. vies
Ing
[Bret Harte in the New York Sun.] ) very
It was a vast silence of pines, re. snit
dulent with balsamic breath, and The
mufflled with the dry dust of dead but
bark and matted mosses. Lying on dog
our backs, we looked upward through ken
a hundred feet of clear, unbroken "'
interval to the first lateral branches dret
that formed the flat canopy above us. on
Here and there the fierce sun, from was
whose active persecution we had just top
escaped, searched for us through the spol
woods, but its keen blade was dulled one
and turned aside by intercostal boughs, roul
and its brightness dissipated in nebu- the;
lons mists throughout the roofing of and
the dim brown aisles around us. We glis
were in another atmosphere, under dern
anothrer sky, indeed in another world and
than the dazzling one we had just "
quitted. The giave silence seemed afte
so much a part of the grateful cool out
ness that we hesitated to speak, and ore
for some moments lay quietly out- lit I
stretched on the pine tassels where his
we had first thrown ourselves. Final. fro,
ly, a voice broke the silence. mnat
"Ask the old Major; be knows all in a
about it." why
The person hero alluded to, under ope
that nmilitary title, was myself. I ed,
hardly need explain to any Califor- the
nian that it by no means followed dot
that I was a "Major," or that I was gets
"old,'' or that I knrw anything about a ri
"it," or indeed what "it" referred to. the
The whole remark was merely one of ing
the usual conventional feelers to con- one
versation-a kind of social preamble the
quite common to our slaugy camp in bee
tercourse. Nevertheless, as I was gin
always known as the Major, perhaps stel
for no better reason than that the ing
speaker, an old journalist, was al- chi,
ways called Doctor, I recognized the lool
fact so far as to kick aside an inter- ,lai
vening saddle so that I could see the con
speaker's face on a level with my see
own, and said nothing. and
"About ghosts," said the doctor, and
after a pause, which nobody broke or get
was expected to break. "Ghosts! asir. ad
That's what we want to know. What out

"Thar's that haunted houseat Cave dei

A dead silence. qu
The doctor (addressing space gen- dri
e orally): "Yes, sir; it was a mighty me
s queer story." hit
Still the same reposeful indiffer- red
Sence. We all knew the doctors skill him
as a raconteur; we all knew that a Ti
s story was comiing; and we all knew tE
that any interruption would be fatal. ere
a Time and time again, in our prospect- til
ingrexperience, had a word of polite the
encouragement, a rash expression of d
interest, even a too eager attitude of ge
silent expectancy, brought the doctor on
to a suddeo change of subject; time cv
and time again had we seen the un- TI
Swary stranger stand amazed and he- es
wildered between our own indiffer- in
t ence and the sudden termination of uF
a promising antidote through his un- cli
lucky interference. So we said noth
e ing. "The Judge"-another instance Jr
of arbitrary nomenclature--pretend- el
e ed to sleep. Jack began to twist a
,o cigarito. Thornton bit off the ends ".
of pine needles refleerively. M
"Yes, sir," continued the doctor, th
" coolly, resting the back of his head mt
on the palms of his hands, "it was w

him home to his irlatives away back ca
or to several generations, and walks off ii
with the swag. No mystery there; n
nothing to clear up; subsequent re- V
of lations only impertinence. Nothitg d
for any ghost to do--who meant bu- v
