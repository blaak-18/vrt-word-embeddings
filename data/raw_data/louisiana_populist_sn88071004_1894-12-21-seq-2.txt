NOTICE TO ADVERTISERS.
All defendants in judicial sales
have the right to select the paper
in which the advertisement is to be
inserted, therefore we would ask
our friends to rive us a bid before
advertising. The Populist is be
ing run in the interest of humani
ty, and it is the dtlty of all men to
support it. Also those who enter
homesteads have a right to select
their own paper for advertising.
Don't fail to give us a call and we
will treat you well.
MONTGOMERY, LA.
Dec. 17th 1894. F
Ed. Poru'Lar:-Before the elec
tion every democrat that you met
claimed that the grand (I) old dem
ocratic party was a friend to silver
mad that one more chance for that
party would absolutely give us the
free coinage of silver, but since
the election I have never heard
one of these democrats or their or
gans open their mouth in favor of
the measure. Even the mighty
Atlanta Constitution that raved so
much about the free coinage of
silver prior to the eleution has now
swallowed the whole Cleveland
Carlisle banking scheme, which
carries upon its face the most un
mitigatedgall ever heard of. A
contention that the Government
itself cannot create money but can
transfer the power to create it to
the banks is a most rediculous ab- 1
surdity and is too flimsy to cover
thedeep laid scheme and perfidy
of those who are eonnected with it.
Thisinfamous scheme to rob the
people has been made too plain
for ay intelligent man (who in
vestigates) to doubt it. The Daily
Pliayaune of the l10th inst, tells us
in a editorial that the silver stand
ard (or free coinage of silver)
would put wheat up to onedollar a
bdsheland cotton to 10 ad 11
cents a pound, but asays the Pie:-
when the farmer comes to pay h I
debta heo would only have a Afli
met dola,. We were hopeful
that this kIlad of demogogy hadI
faded away before the intalli

' horse and has the money to pay
for it, the vahlue is in the horse and
no,,t the money, if it was in the
1inon. he would keep it and let the
horse alone, the man who sells the
horse puts the money in his pock
ets where it lays perfectly domant
. and worthless until he sees some
thing that he desires, then the
:value is in what he (eslres and he
parts with his money in order to
obtain that which is of value to
him and so continues this exchange
of value for money. Now; the
Picayune of some date says, "in
addition to th immense bounded
indebtedness and interr' thereon
that we have to pay i) gold, we
also have a railroad nond and
mortgage indebtedness of TrIR
TEEN BI.LION DOLLARs with inter
est to pay on that." Now will old
lady Pie. please explain why the
people of the United States have
to pay this immense sunm of money
in gold to the railroads? Will ii
please tell us when the people here
a ever received a single cent in rc
o turn therefrom?
If it will do so it will certainly
he of more interest to the people
than its nonsencical jargon upon
s intrinsic value and jflty cent dollar,
and while the old lady has her
hand in perhaps she might be in
order to tell what benefit the dear
people had from the one hundred
r million dollars bond issue with five
[ per cent interest for the people to
I pay, and also the seventy million
dollars to be donated to the Nica
raugus canal scheme, also the one
hundred and sixty million dollars
to he loaned the Northern Pacific
railroad, also the sixty thousand
dollars per month that is donated
t as a subsidy to each of three steam
ship lines, also the one hundred
and ninty-one million acres of pub
lic hind donated to the railroads
of the United States. Now to the
gigantic mind of the WALL STREET
editor of the Pie. these questions
may be very simple but to the
great masses of the people they
are hard to understand, and they
are so simple we doubt not the Pic.
can explain without any trouble, as
the Pic. is a gallant democratic
journal and all these measures are
either democratic or endorsed by
the democratic party, some direct
ly, and some indirectly. Now Pic,
until you explain these matters to
the satisfa stion of the people you
had just as well hush about your
cheap dollar. The farmer wants
one dollar wheat and ten cent cot
ton, and you say that a silver
standard will give them. Let us
have the silver standard by all
means, the farmers are willing to
risk the fifty cent dollar.

City Council. Natehitoches. La.
t My Dear Sir:-Your kind invi
tation to attend the meeting of the
e Louisiana State Agricultural So
e ciety, to be held m your city Jan
u nary 1895, has been received.
, I will most assuredly accept
e your invitation and be with you,
e provided no providential hin
drances occur. I will also take
I great pleasure in responding to
n the request of your citizens to do
e liver an address on the culture of
1 either sugar cane or tobacco, and
will see that the other subject is
well handled by some one capable
and competent of doing so. Please
assure the citizens of your commu
e nity that they will have a full and
free discussion on both of thee
t subjects, sugar cane and tobacco.
e I would suggest that your May.
or and City Council select a com
mittoe on reception, as well a
some one of your number to belivl
er an address of welcome to the
Society. This should be done as
early as possible, so it may be comrn
municated to the Secretary, E. L.
Woodside, Baton Rouge, for inser
tion on the regular programme.
I sincerely trust that the meet
, ing which will be held at Natchito
ches in January next, will be as
a beneficial as those that have been
held elsewhere in the State.
Yours very truly,
Wx. C. STUBBS,
Director.

C. E. Oreneaux. Esq., Secretary and
'reasnrer, Natchitoches, La.:
I Dear Sir:-Referring again to
- your favor of the 29th ult. extend
ing the invitation to the city of
Natchitoches to the Louisiana State
Agricultural Society to hold its
next annual meeting in your city,
and stating again as then, that
while the invitation- has been prac
tically and already reoepted, and
in fact our good friend Commis
sioner Carter, is already doing all
that he can to make it a success,
I now beg leave to report the offi
cial acceptance by the executive
committee of your invitation and
would say that we shall do all in
our power to make the session at
Natchiteches a brilliant sucoess.
Our secretary and members of the
Executive Committee will corres
pond with you, and perhaps have
the pleasure of visiting you in the
interim, and I hope that the fnim
results will justify the efforts that
you are making.
Yours truly,
JOHN DYMOND.

the General Agent of the Peabody

Very respectfully,

That Contest.
M We have received several inqui
ries from our readers, whether or
not Mr. Bailey intended to contest
Mr. Ogden's right to a seat in the
next Congress, basing such contest
upon the grass frauds perpetrated
in the late election.
1 We answer that he has already
served notice of such contest upon
Mr. Ogden as the law requires and
is making every effort possible to
push that contest to a successful
issue. But his friends must re
member that it requires a sum of
money entirely beyond Mr. Bailey's
means to even decently prosecute
this eontest.
I Besides this, his triends in the
"Ave parishes of Bossier, Caddo,
I DeSots, Red River and Bapides
should gather all evidence of fraud
and forward it to the LoUJlr xA
IPoPULST which will be headquar
I ters in this Aght.
I o person who knows Mr. Bail
ey well, would think for a moment
that be had given unt the fight of
his own ;will. He is not built of
that kind of stuff. But he may be
forced to give It up unless Popu
lists rally to his support with ;their
I time and what money they can
spare.
Times are bard to mention men
sy, but we are all in the same boat
In money matters, and this line of
fighting is the only one we know
of to bring relief and we must lghtr
it out or do worse.
Wehavenot yet tasted of the
sadferiag and privations oar rev
olutionary ancestors endured for
liberty, though ouear bondage under
GroverII is ten time more op.
presivethan that of George III,
but we have the privilege of mak
ing thbi fight with ballots, while
ear neestors were eompelled to
use bullets, and hence their great
or hardships.
Let every Popualist contribute
hism ite, if it is only a dime and
we assure them that the frauds
pmreticed in this distriet will be 1
vegetilated sad the neet congress
wl begivena ehaes to, put it
self on record for or against ir
elections.
The Outlook
The result of the recent eleetion
are everyting that a ressonable
oremer ould possibly expect or
ask or. The popUlist lost eve
ral members in the lower hese of
cogress to be sure; but gained
enough seators to nearly make up
for it.
But the aggregate vote is fully
asu great asb the mosst sagplae pop.
ulist eould hope for, sad mueh lar- .
Sthat theod parties were wit. I
liag to eeaede. a
What has bue herldMed as s i
grst "usepbLican ledslide" is in
reality neare like a republ ica Ih
moral. With the ereeptioneftwo
Sthre states the o et 1I
thiryearIs mus below that of I
18". We venare the prediction
1 that the oflicial returns show that
the "overwheming majority in tlhe
house of representatives" was ob
r tained by considerably less than
f 40 per cent of the entire vote cast,
t and not to exceed 33 per cent of
i the total voting population of the
s country. If there is anything in
m this to crow over the republican
shouters are perfectly welcome to
it.
The prospects of the People's
r party were never as bright and en
couraging as now. Victory in 1896
has never been as flattering as now.
Here are some of the reasons:
First: Republicans sent emissa
a ries into the silver states solemnly
a promising free silver if republicans
won. Free silver will not be forth
coming, and the mountaineers can
I not be fooled again in 1896.
Becond : Republican speakers
and newspapers have made the
' people believe that "times would
be better" if republicans returned
to power. The times will not be
any better; mark our words for
that. In 1896 the people will not
" be fooled a second time by a prom
ise of better times. On the con
trary, they will be anxious to pun.
ish the men who misled them this
time.
Third: The "Solid South" has
been broken; and this means that
the main prop of the democratic
party is gone. Without the solid
south there can be no democratic
party. The democracy will go to
pieces; one portion of it (the Cleve
land wing) will naturally drift into
the republican fold and the other
(the better and more progressive)
will join the people's party.
Fourth: The dissolution of the
democratic party means inevitable
death to the republican party. For
a quarter of a centuary it has lived
and thrived on its opposition to
democracy. Hereafter it must
fight the people's party-and the
fighting must be upon the lines
proposed by the people's party
and not on a bogus "tariff" issue
or a "bloody shirt." Upon a
square fight upon the principles
contending for by the new party
the populists will sweep the coun
try from Maine to California like a
whirlwind.
Fifth: The bogus "tarif" issue
has played its part. Republicans
will let the tariff question stand
exactly where the Wilson bill left
it. The money question, and not
the "tariff," is the one vital issue.
And the people know it.--4hicago

Their common Enemy.
Representative Sayers of Texas,
demoerat, who has painfhlly made
his way back to Congreuu, con.
Arms the Tribune's view that the
two old parties look upon the
Popalist. as their common enemy,
as follows:
Ineverl e d to like the re
publIeans until this campaign.
That was because they aided my
re-eleetlon. It it had not been for
republican votes I should have to
go out of eongress on the 4th ot
next Marseb. I begin to believe
that there is some good in the
paurty, especially in Texas. The
republieans joined with tho demo
rate in support of the demooratic
eMandlates as against the Popu
lists. In Kansas, I have asnce
learned, the democrats voted for
the republiean eandidate as against
the Pqpllsta. The Populist is
the commeu enemy and must be

Some one has wittily said that
a nothing is so cowardly as $I,0 i,

wealth are too seltish by nature to
r be patriotic. History is full of
t wrecked civilizations that perished
only because the wealth of the
people went into the hands of a
few. A living proof of this is
s seen in the late civil war, in the
different bargains secured by thoso
3 who offered their lives and those
t who offered their money to their
country.-National Watchman.
TO THE PRESS
State Bureau of Agricultare,
Baton Rouge, La-, Dec. 7, '9.
We desire to call your attention
to the ninth annual meeting of the
Louisiana State agricultural Society
which will take place at Natchito
ches on January 23, 24 and 25,
1895.
A large and representative body
I of planters and farmers of this
State is desired at this meeting.
To accomplish this every agrical
tural organization, including plan
ters' associations, farmers' clubs,
granges and unions are earnestly
requested to send delegates.
The committee on programme
has appealed to the police juries of
the various parishes to send two
or more planters or farmers as del
egates from each parish. Favor
able action of each police jury is
not only most earnestly desired,
but will meet with the honest ap
proval of every friend of agrioul
ture.
The present financial condition
of our agriculturists calls for seri
ous thought and deliberation.
Low prices of our staple products,
unreliable labor, soil depletion and
high money rates have deprived
onr profession of much of its prof
its and all of its pleasures. Chan
ges in our methods and perhaps
in our crops are imperative, and
what these shall be can be best
determined by the combined wis
dom of assembled couventions of
oar leading men. It is therefore
earnestly desired that farmers and
planters from all parts of the State
be present at this meeting and
participate in its deliberations.
The old 01t of Natchitechee will
extend its usual hospitality, and
the farmers of Cane river will wel
come theLr brothers fom other por- "
times o the 8tate.
Respecutfully,
A. V. CATEB~,

A Washingtoa dspatch says:
The returns to the statistical divis
ion of the department of Agricul
tunre for the month of December
relate prinoipally to the average
frm price of the yarious agricul
tural products on the frst day of
tbs month. By farm pricep is
meant the price of products on the
farm, or in the nearest local town
or railway market. In compar
isons of these prices with. commer
oial quotations, allowace must 'be
mad. for cost of handling, trans
portations, prots of dealers. The
averageplatation price of ootton,
u sun by the department's re
port. on December 1, was4.9cents
per pound, against 6.99 cents for
the smDe date last year, and 4 cents
in the year 1892, a decline from
thepricesof these years repective
ly of 9.00 and 8.5 cents per pound.
The lowness of this price is with
out precedent
