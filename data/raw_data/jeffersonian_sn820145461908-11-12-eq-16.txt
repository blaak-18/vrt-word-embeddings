Some of our advertisers have asked
the question as to how the election
will affect our circulation. So far, it
is not only holding its own, but
shows signs of improvement. Sub
scriptions continue to come in at the
same old lively rate, and our agents
have spit on their hands and taken
a fresh grip, for they are sending
for more sample copies and say that
there is every indication of a big bus
iness for us this winter.
PROSPICE.
By Robert Browning.
Fear death? —to feel the fog in my
throat,
The mist in my face,
When the snows begin, and the blasts
denote
I am nearing the place,
The power of the night, the press of
the storm,
The post of the foe;
Where he stands, the Arch Fear, in a
visible form,
Yet the strong man must go:
For the journey is done and the sum
mit attained,
The reward of it all.
I was ever a fighter—so, one fight
more,
The best and the last!
I would hate that death bandaged my
eyes, and forbore,
And hade me creep past.
No! let me taste the whole of it, fare
like my peers,
The heroes of old,
Bear the brunt, in a minute pay glad
life’s arrears
Os pain, darkness and cold.
For sudden the worst turns the best
to the brave,
The black minute’s at end,
And the elements’ rage, the fiend
voices that rave,
Shall dwindle, shall blend,
Shall change, shall become first a
peace out of pain,
Then a light, then thy breast.
0 thou soul of my soul! I shall clasp
thee again,
And with God be the rest.
“FOR SHORT.’’
The names bestowed upon some of
the small Southern negroes remind
one of those of the old Roundhead
days—Hope Above Williams, Have
Faith to Be Saved John Mitchell, and
so on. Not long ago a visitor in
Richmond was having his shoes pol
ished by a little coal black specimen
about eighteen inches in height, but
• possessed of gleaming white teeth and
rolling eyes.
“What is your name?” the visitor
idly asked.
“Gen, sab,” was the reply, accom
panied by a grin of startling propor
tions. a
“ ‘Gen?’ I suppose that, is an
abbreviation of general?” the visitor,
who had some idea of the fondness of
negroes for titles, inquired.
“No, sah; don’t know as ’tis, ”
was the reply, “abbreviation” evi
dently being too much for him. “Mah

Gen for short!” —Bohemian.
A QUEER TEST.
The grocer said to the applicant:
“Your references are good. Show
me y®ur style of weighing out five
pounds of sugar. There’s the scales.”
The applicant wreathed his face in
the amiable smile all salesmen wear
and weighed out the sugar with dis
patch and accuracy. He put on too
little sugar at first; he added gently a
full half-pound before the scale bal
anced.
“You’ll do,” said the grocer. “You
understand the scale trick. It is plain
that you learned your trade in the
thorough old-school way.”
“Yes, sir,” the other answered. “I
learned in the country, and almost my
first lesson was that in weighing. You
must add, add, add, till the beam tips,
because all that adding pleases the
customer —seems to him almost like a
gift. But if, on the contrary, you sub
tract from the quantity on the scale
the customer is affected in the op
posite way—you seem to be robbing
him. He goes away convinced that
you are a stingy cheat.” —New Or
leans Times-Democrat.
BEATEN AT HIS OWN GAME.
“A few days since,” relates a
solicitor, “as I was sitting with my
friend I), in his office a man came in
and said:
“ ‘Mr. W., the livery stable keeper,
tricked me shamefully yesterday, and
I want to be even with him.’
“ ‘State your case,’ said D.
“ ‘I asked him how much he’d
charge me for a horse to go to Rich
mond. He said half a sovereign. I
took the horse, and when I came back
he said he wanted another half sover
eign for coming back and made me
pay it.’
“D. gave his client some legal ad
vice, which he immediately acted upon
as follows: He went to the livery
stable keeper and said, ‘How much
will you charge for a horse to Wind
sor?’
“The man replied, ‘A sovereign.’
“Client accordingly went to Wind
sor, came back by rail and went to
the livery stable keeper, saying:
“ ‘Here is your money,’ paying him
a sovereign.
“ ‘Where is my horse?’ said W.
“ ‘He’s at Windsor,’ answered the
client. ‘I hired him only to go to
Windsor.’ ” —Pearson’s Weekly.

Keep a soft cloth always at hand
to wipe boots and shoes carefully,
and a brush to remove the dust that
accumulates between sole and uppers;
also around the buttons, laces and
flaps. Before putting them away rub
them all over with a thin coating of
vaseline, then put them on shoe trees
and let stand where they will have
thorough ventilation. This will pre
serve the leather. Before wearing
them again rub off the vaseline with
a soft cloth and apply a little polish
ing cream, followed by a brisk rub,
sufficient to remove all grease. It is
best to buy new insoles often, and
have them pasted in, as they keep the
shoes dainty and fresh.—Woman's
