Editor Populist :
I wish to say to the Populists of
our Senatorial District that it was
with no little degree of surprise
that I heard of my nomination for
the State Senato. I have never
been an aspirant for office, but
have been a simon p)ure Populist,
andt an advocate of reform. I
have done all in my power to get
enthusiasm aroused among my
people, and have endeavored to I
make all my neighbors students of
political economy.
I see the necessity of the people
organ zing. I have watched the
movements of both the old politi
cal parties with intense interest
and have dtiscovered long since that
greed and avarice existed in their
every movement. That it is nec
essary to have a chanwge, no honest
patriot will deny. That it is im
possible to get reform through any
political organization that has nev
er advocated reform and that is led
and directed by a set of political I
bosses who are working for their
own individual interest, we all see.
Then having realized the fact that
labor produces all wealth, and that
about one fourth of the people of
this great American continent are
filching a high living off the labor
of the other three fourths, and
they,. the producers of all the great
common wealth of this great coun- I
try, are living (90 per cent of them)
in mortgaged homes or on land a
owned by aliens, taking just what
they can get, asking for nothing
only what their lords see fit to give r
them, as it is useless to make a de
mand. Seeing that such things ex
ist right here in a free country
when the individual interest of I
every citizen should be protected, t
it aroused a spirit of patriotism
within me, and as my friends have
honored me with a nomination for
State Senator, I will go to work in
deed earnest. I will make the
moat thorough campaign possible. I
Friends, I will visit you if poe- I
sible. I will speak for you on any I
mad all occasions. I will take
plemure in meeting my opponents c
