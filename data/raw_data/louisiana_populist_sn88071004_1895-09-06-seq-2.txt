We have heard that there is such
ylandr as the Shreveport Judge,
whi has hCit l om.. hin to ac
abtion.ut us, but it lacked the X an
hoih to send us a copy containing
its criticism.
Vol. 1, No. 1 of the Appeal to
Reason, a rd hno t Ponpulist paper
has reached us. Its editor is J. A.
Wayland, one of the most consist
ent journalists in our ranks, and
Kansas City, Flo.. his field of ac
tion. Weto are plaont ed to X, anof
wish Bro. Wayland success and
prosperity.
The lomeUCatic Silver League,
o o-dered by the old Democratic ma
chine, and now being urged by the
Enterprise in this parish, was or
dere! to counteract the effect of
the Bimetallic League, and hold
the old machmne together, but it
will never accomplish it. The
game was exposed at the very out
set, and laughed to ecorn.
The Enterprise of last week mis
represents Bro. J. W. Jones, by
saying that he addressed it meeting
of six men and three boys. Mr.
Jones says he did no such thing,
but that the meeting he was to have
addressed at night was postponed
at a singing convention during the
day, and that he left for home at
noon.
Has it ever struck you that it is
thirteen months after a Congress
man's election before he takes his
seat Don't you see through it?
We do. In that length of time
corporations, gold bugs-all ene
mies to our commonwealth will get
in their work and boy, yes buy
enough men to secure their ends.
Not that they expect to pas many
more laws. We are fettered hand
andM foot now, and the present sys
tem is good enough for them, bmt
by obstructing all legislation tend
ing to rqiuf, enjoy the fruits of
such damnable laws already in ope
ration.
Thirteen months in which to op
erate, sad millions of money to
sue. We would like to hear others
express themselves on this.

More ('ampaigning.
On Wetcnesda:v afternoon of la.t
week, in (Otalp'any with a: old timi'
friend. MJr. I). (. Freci:an, of
Lake E1?I, we hstarted out to till
crlt lre viously alvertisel a"l,point
went at ('oushatta.
After :, ple.:asant drive of soi,
4 hours, we reached 'I r. Freeman'
,retty hoe near Lake End, . in
lHed Hiver parish, ~ here we spent
the nighlt most p1leasantIv. Mir.
Flreeman has, hy c(lose attention
and fiir dealing built nul a nice lit -
tie nmeroelntile business there. which
is now paying hint well for his
pains lie is assisted by his broth
er-in-law Mr. *Janmes Woodruff.
Both of these young men came
from Winn parish, and have lis
played all the energy, perse er
atee and "get there" qualities for
which such stock are noted.
Mr. Freeman has only recently
taken an interest in politics. but
was clear-iheaded enough to choose
the right side, hence is a Populi4t,
and from the books and pals rs' one
tinds about his premises, it is plain
that he arrived at his decision by
close stludy. Mr. Freeman is go
ing to make one of the most ag
gressive and determined workers
in our party in Red River.
A 2 hours' drive next morning
brought us to the pretty little town
of ('oushatta, nestled among its
shade trees on a pretty piece of
bank on old Red. We were soon
shaking hands and getting acquaint
ed with the farmers and business
men of Red River, many of whom
had turned out to hear something
new on the vexed questions that
are now absorbing public attention.
About one hundred voters, 15. or
20 of whom were D)emocrats as
sembled in the Courthouse andt at
12 m. the meeting was called to
order by MIr. T. II. Hlannltcn and
MIr. Sam Pincus, one of Coushat
ta's oldest merchants, called to the
chair. We were then introduced
as the only speaker for that day,
and so we concluded after sizing
up our audience that nothing but
a lengthy speech would satisfy
them, and we turned our battery
loose for abour 3 hours, ani had
the best of order and attention
throughout. Truly those are po
lite and generous ~eople, for a!
most anywhere else we would have
had the doors to close up by our
self after talking that length of
time.
After the meeting was over Mr.
Pincus took charge of us, and in
company with Messrs. D. M. Gid
dens and T. IH. Hlamiltop, we were
soon in his pleasant and luxurious
home. Mrs. Pincus and her pret
ty daughter, Miss Gussie, served
with their own hands a repast that
did ample justice to the condition
of our appetite at 5 o'clock in the
afternoon. Mrs. Pineus assured
us, however, that we had spoiled
the dmner by keeping it waiting
so long. After the meal was over
and we had returned to the parlor,
Miss Gussie rendered some pretty
and soul-inspiring music on the
piano. Mr. Pincus informed us
that he and his children had quite
a musical turn, and we did not
doubt it as we saw almost every
kind'of an instrument, from the
elegant piano to the wel-tuned old
banjo. We were highly entertain
ed by this interesting family.
We then called on editor Clark
son, of the Conushatts Citizen, and
spent a pleasant half hour in talk
ing over the issues of the day. We
found him an iptelligent and lib
eral minded Democrat, and hope
to meet him again.
At a late bopr m the evening we
took leave of the plesuat little
townand made our way to the
more quiet, but happy little home
of T. H. Hamiltom, 4 mites away.
Here we made the acquaintanee of
his father, an intelligent old gen
tIeman aof sammers, and his
giadfather, Mr. Madison Moblaey,
me of thesldest reaideaut of that
uo.tia, and though 86 years of
age, lastill hale and hearty. We

"Free Silver at 16 to 1"
Has Never Been In The Demo
cratic Creed, or Sustained
by a Democratic Con
gress.
From the Ok ,tOna 1t. .) } -'. Mt ng r.
1To the People's party is due the
credit of ag itatiung this mon tes
lion for yetars past. It is the only
national party that 'ver dect1lared
for l14 to 1 or my oth(er ratito and
in all its etfforts to arouste the peo
ple on this vital subject it ha,, had
to contend with huoth the old par
ties. Now that the 'people' have
Ite.otme f:irlh eduEatedl, and are
beginluin, to understand not only
the ct'ause of their nlisfortunesi , but
also, who are responsible for them,
thie Itrecherous old )ltieocracy' l
ver's best andtl ,ely availablel fri'endl.
That this claim i. wholly unfton-, i -
ed any unprejutdicelj man will uin
dehrtand whein helit ex:uinesL tihe r-t'
cordtl ade by the pai'ty. lHere It
Ist. The 4Itth ('Conress having,,
a Democratic majority of 42 on
April sth, .is,;, killed a Hill pirio
viding for the free and unlinmited
coinage of silver at a ratio of 1'; to
1.
2nd. The 52nd Coniress h'avini
a I )eimoratic majority of I it, on
the 24th day of \larch 15142. killed
a free coinage hill at a ratio of 14;
to 1.
:;rdt. The same ('ong ress on Ju
ly 13th of the samne year, over
whelmningly defeated another. free
coinagt hill, 11; to 1, AFTER IT HAD
t'ASSEi) A RIiP'B.ICAN SENATE, and
when it was well undhrstood l that
Ia Relpblican President, although
individually oppos,d to free silver,
had said hxe would approve it. if
passed by the 1)enlocratic House.
4th. On the 2:rdl of Aulgust
1 `:.. the' :r'od ('ongress called in
,extra s...i n by Mr. Clevelan4d de
feated a hi il providing for the free
coinage of silver at It; to I ly a
a two thirds vote. This Congress
had a Democtratic majority over
Ioth Republicans and Populists of
Ns. but the ten Pops voted for the
bill thus making the I)e mocratic
majority, if re'lly in favor of free
silver lo t over the RepIbticans.
There were 217 lenmlo(rats on
the floor of the lhusle when this
vote was taken and ONE 1UN)IE)'
AND ONE VOTED FOR TlE M1EASURE
AND ONE IIUNDRED AND SIXTEEN
VOTED AAINtnT IT. SO theo it will
be seen, if ntheotly but l)emnwerats
had been present and voting the
bill would have been defeated by a
mfljfirity cf tifteen.t
5. t. On the saeu day, nainely
August 2ird, 1 s53, this stameo )em
ocrati: Congress vo)ted down a sec
(ond proposition to coin silver free,
at a ratio of 17 to 1 by a still larg
tith. On the same day this same
('onress voted down another pro
position, hlooking to "the parity"
of the two metals, at IS to 1.
7th. On the sanme any, another
bill providing for the free coinage
of silver at l1l to 1, WaLQ defeated.
Sth. On the same day, another
proposititon looking to the free and
unlimited coinage of silver at a ra
tio of "24 to 1 was -nowied under in
a itneoratic Houste.
And thus it was five bills lprovi
(ling for the free and unhmited
coinage of silver was beaten in a
representative body now profess
ing to be the friend of the white
metal as the clerk could call the
roll. And don't forget honest
D)emocratic reader, that in every
solitary instance, a majority of
your Dlemocratic Congressmen vo
ted awainst silver and in favor of
the single gold standard.
9th. On Nov. 1st, 1893, the
53nr Congress, with its 83 Demo
cratic majority over all, voted
down an amendment offered by Mr.
Bland to a pending bill, which
amendment provided for the free
and unlimited coinage of silver at
16 to 1.
10th. On October 27th, 1893,
the United States 2senate, having a
Democratic majority of three over
all, and when the four Populist
Senators were counted for silver,
the majority over the Republieans
was eleven, defeated Senator Stew
art's amendment providing for
free comage of silver at 16 to l.
11. In Feb. 1895 the 53rd Con
gress being in session with a Demo
cratic majority m both Hose. and
a Dethooratic (so-called) Executive,
the Finance committee of the Sen

DIED :
FRE)DIEU--()n Thurrday. Aug.
:2th, 1S..5, at his honw on Bayou
Pierre, P. W1. FREDIEU ; aged 44
years.
Like a thunderlbolt from a clear
sky came the announcement of MIr.
Fredicu's death, and it was with
reluctance coupled with sorrow
that we heard it. Apparently the
very picture of health, "Wash"
was seen on our streets a week ago,
and the news of his death was in
deed a shock to his many friends.
Deceased was a typical creole
gentleman, modest, plain and un
assuming; he won many warm
friends, generous to a fault, and
upright in all his dealings, he leaves
a record which many would be
proud of. To his sarrowing friends
and relatives, our sympaties are
extended in their hour of berdave
ment.
Our neighbor, the Enterprise, is
apparently rejoicing over the or
ganization of Democratie Silver
Leagues in the parish, but the way
those leagues have been captured
by anti-Foster men, and true silver
.resolutions passed, is not at all
relished by that paper and its
backers.
Bro. Hundley of the Olla Signal,
compliments us because he seems to
thinks we are trying to reform the
People's party. He is mistaken :
we are only trying to reform the
lawyers that have come into our
party for the fat judicial offices.
