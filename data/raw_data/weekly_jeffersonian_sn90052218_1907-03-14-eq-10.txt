Suggestion.
Jefferson City, Mo., Feb. 19. —The
senate passed the house two-cent pas
senger rate bill today, after amending

ing a penalty of a fine of SIOO to SSOO

■was added at the request of Attorney

Charleston, W. Va., Feb. 19. —The
conference committee of the house
having with one exception agreed to
the senate two-cent rate bill, with a

versity of California, and Princess
Liuab Lobanoff Rostovsky were mar

FRANCE DOUBTS ENGLAND.
Paris. —While France Is not opposed
to joining Great Britain and the Uni
ted States in a discussion of the limi
tation of armaments at the approach
ing peace conference at The Hague,
the government nevertheless doubts
the sincerity of England.
PROFESSORS STRIKE.
Vienna. —Politics In the universities
has resulted in a strike of all members
of the faculty, including the rector,
and the suspension of all lectures in
the University of Bucharest. The
minister of education Is Indignant and
threatens severe disciplinary meas
ures.
Sinecures for the Defeated.
(From the Boston Herald.)
“Why does the federal government
—or Its head, the president—deem
It the proper thing to ‘provide a place
for office holders who have been re
tired by their constituents’? Is this
practice fair toward the people?”
OLD SWET QUITS.
London.—According to an announce
ment by Under Secretary for the Colo
nies Winston Churchill, in the house
of commons, Gov. Swettenham was
given an opportunity to withdraw his
resignation of January 23, but has no
tified the home office that he has de
cided not to continue at the Jamaica
post.

AN INTERESTING CONTEST.
London. —An interesting contest is
imminent between Lord Curzon and
Lord Rosebery for the vacant chan
cellorship of Oxford university.
It has been supposed that Lord Cur
zon, who was nominated to this office,
would be returned without opposition,
but now Lord Rosebery also has ac
cepted a nomination and the matter
will be decided on March 14, when the
election will be held.
Legislative Carelessness.
(From the Long Branch Record.)
An illustration of legislative care
lessness is afforded by the situation
regarding the execution of criminals
in this state. Hangings have been
abolished and electrocution substitut
ed, but no provisions have been made
for infliction of this punishment. A
strange oversight, the uninitiated may
think. But there is no session of the
legislature at Trenton without a num
ber of such mistakes —all inexplaina
ble except on the ground of gross neg
ligence.

The Noble Army of Dodgers.
(From The World.)
The salary grab has been put
through by congress, and the sena
tors were honest enough to record
their vote on the 50 per cent increase.
The members of the house of repre
sentatives, however, dodged a roll call,
so as to evade personal criticism and
be able to say the other fellows did
it, “not I.” As the cost of living has
increased over 50 per cent under the
Republican system of protecting the
trusts, there of course must eventual
ly be a similar increase in all sala
ries, but members of congress showed
their selfishness by adding 50 per cent
to their own allowances while leaving
the army and navy and the govern
ment clerks and laborers at their
present rate, which in many instances
is none too generous under the chang
ed conditions from ten years ago.
Progress of the Jews.
(From the American Press.)
Go to the east side in New York city
and you will be astonished at the
progress which the Jews are making.
Their children are in school and are
refusing to speak Yiddish at home or
at play. As a rule they are an indus
trious, frugal and law-observing class
of people. They own things, or will,
either merchandise or some little bus
iness, and as men of property they
will be conservative citizens.
It
Six for a Quarter.
(From the Minneapolis Tribune.)
Mayor Haynes has attached his sig
nature to the ordinance requiring the
Minneapolis Street Railway Company
to furnish six street car rides for a
quarter. In returning the signed or
dinance to the council Mayor Haynes
accompanied it with a special message
recommending further action along
the same line.
THE WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
MANY BALES OF COTTON BURN IN
NEW ORLEANS.
New Orleans. —About one thousand
bales of cotton and an entire section
of the New Orleans cotton press shed
was destroyed by fire. The loss is es
timated at about $50,000.

Free Murder in Minnesota.
(From the Minneapolis Tribune.)
Fifty-six murder prosecutions in the
last two years is the record made by
Minnesota as shown by the county at
torneys’ reports listed in the biennial
report of the attorney general’s office.
Os this number thirty-nine were first
degree, fifteen second degree and five
third degree. Out of the fifty-six trials
three death sentences were imposed
and executed and thirteen life sent
ences were imposed.
The First Railway Wreck.
(From the New York World.)
On July 24, 1846, occurred the first
railway accident of note in the United
States. It happened on the Erie road,
then less than five years old. A car
went through Seaman’s bridge, near
Monroe, Pa. Three persons were
killed outright, three died later of
their injuries.
This casualty aroused great interest
at home and abroad. No columns of
matter from the railway officials
were printed explaining that the acci
dent was unexplainable. There was
no board of railroad commissioners to
certify that everything it could find in
the road’s equipment was all’’right.
In suits for damages it was estab
lished that the wreck was caused by
the collapse of a cast-iron spoked
wheel. The railroad paid the judg
ments. And straightway the wheel
with spokes gave way to the solid pat
tern used later on all the roads in the
country.
But that was sixty years ago.

Pass an Anti-Trust Law.
(From the Newark News.)
The concurrent resolution introduc
ed in the legislature yesterday by
Senator Minturn authorizing the ap
pointment of a special joint committee
to investigate the coal and ice trusts,
will add to the interest aroused over
recent developments but should it be
passed by both houses, it might not
be sufficient to correct the prevailing
abuses. What the legislature needs
to do is to pass a stringent anti-trust
law that will absolutely prevent the
formation of combines in restraint of
trade and will put out of business any
such trusts now in existence. An in
vestigation of the coal and ice com
binations will do no practical good so
long as there is no law on the statute
books of this state forbidding such
combines. Vice Chancellor Stevens,
in an opinion bearing on this very
point, has declared that there Is no
law in New Jersey adequate to deal
with trusts, and although the case has
been appealed on the ground that the
common law offers a remedy, still it
is the duty of the legislature to fore
stall any court decision that may sus
tain Vice Chancellor Stevens’ find
ing.
The Waffle.
Thus far, we believe, no evidence
has been adduced to show that the
humble waffle of commerce is danger
ous when taken internally.—Chicago
Tribune.
FAMINE IN CHINA WORSE.
Victoria, B. C. —Advices from cen
tral China report famine conditions
becoming worse. Middle aged women
are being sold for from ten to fifteen
dollars and children for three to four
dollars. Complaints are made that offi
cials are delaying shipments of flour
sent by the foreign relief committee.
In some places dogs are being caught
by the starving people by means of
traps and hooks and are eaten as soon
as captured.
PARIS ATE 45,000 HORSES.
Paris. —About 45,000 horses were
eaten in this city during 1906, the
number of those sold on the public
markets being 29,937. This would
bring up the total amount of equine
flesh consumed in Paris to twenty-two
million pounds, or eight pounds for
each inhabitant of this city.
Where Women Can Vote.
(From the Indianapolis News.)
Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and Idaho
admit women to suffrage on terms
equal with the men. Wyoming began
it in 1869 and Idaho established it in
1896. Many other states have since
been importuned, but have refused.
There is, however, partial woman suf
frage in many states, an account of
which the Kansas City Star gives
thus: “In Kansas women possess
school suffrage, established In 1891,
and municipal suffrage, established in
1887. In eighteen additional states
women possess school suffrage. In
Michigan and Minnesota, establish
ed in 1875; in New Hampshire and
Oregon in 1878; in Massachusetts in
1879; in New York and Vermont in
1880; in Nebraska in 1883; in Wiscon
sin in 1900; in Washington in 1889; in
Arizona, Montana, New Jersey, North
and South Dakota in 1887; in Illinois
in 1891; in Connecticut in 1893, and
in Ohio in 1894. Two states permit
women to vote upon the issuance of
municipal bonds; Montana, establish
ed in 1886 and lowa in 1894. Louisiana
gave all women taxpayers the suffrage
upon all questions submitted to tax
payers in 1898. In 1901 the New York
legislature passed a law providing
that ‘a woman who possesses the
qualifications to vote for village or for
town officers, except the qualification
of sex, who is the owner of property
in the village assessed upon the last
preceding assessment roll thereof, is
entitled to vote upon a proposition to
raise money by tax or assessment.’ ”
Sensational Trials.
(From the Savannah News.)
The two serials running in the
newspapers now—the Thaw case in
New York and the Strother case in
Virginia—are not calculated to create
the impression that the world is grow
ing better, morally. It is not often
that accounts of two such sensational
trials of a similar character appear
in the public prints at the same time.
It is certainly to be hoped there will
not be such an occurrence again soon.
Empire Builders of Japan.
(From the Springfield Union.)
In 1892 Japan had thirty-one Indus
trial schools. Now it has 1,954. This
throws some light on the way the lit
tle brown race is trying to huild an
empire.
