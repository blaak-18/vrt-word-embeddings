MAGNIFICENT WORK
PLAN TO CONNECT GREAT LAKES AND
THE GULF OF MEXICO.
Proposed Route Inelades Chicago
Drainage Canal. Illinoli River aid
the Mislissippl-Its Feasibility amd
Great Advantages.
[Special Correspondence.]
CHICAGO, Jan. 1.-Chicago, which is
the home of great things, is just now
considering the splendid project ,of
uniting Itself with the gulf of Me1lco
by means of a waterway. It Is not by
any means a new plan, for It has been
it contemplation ever since the famous
drainage canal was talked about. The
dlrautage canal Is to be an Integral part
of the proposed system. New Impetus
is given to the subject just now by the
discussiol of the Nicaragua canal, for
If Chicago aHd the central states were
connected by cater with the gulf and
with Latin America the Isthmlan canal
would afford them direct maritime coi
nection with the Pacific coast and Asia.

within Itself the germs of unlimited op
portunltles and possibilities for the
great central portion of our country
and Is of undoubted importance to th
other sections.
The plan briefly outlilned is to connec
Chicago and the gulf by way of the
dralnage canal, the Illinol- river and
the Mississppl. The project, though of
vast magnitude and entailing enormon
expense, to entirely feuasible. It ha.

The supportern of the project point
out the benefits thatwould accrue to the
United States through the waterway.
and they contend that the cost of the
enterprise, though undoubtedly great.
would be more than compensated. Of
course the te proposed waterway must be
under federal control, since a large
number of states are directly or Indl
rectly lnterested in It. The central
states point out that most of their
produets are shipped now at blgb rates
by rail, and it costs about 60 cents per
100 pounds to reach the seaboard. With
he new waterway In succeseful opera
tion this east would be greatly less
eaed.
It Is pointed out that this facilitation
of trade would greatly increase Amer
can commerce with our southern -neigh
bors, which rightfully belongs to qs It
we had 14 feet of water from Chicago
to the gulf, vessels could load at Chiae
go or any of the nltermediate citiee and
without breaking bulk could reachb all
South and Central Americ. With the
Nicaragua canal doug they could easily
supply the wants of the Pacific Islands
and coasts. The cities In the territory
tributary to the propeasd waterway are
entholuastl In their support of the
plan.
Much more could be written of the
advantages to be derived from the ac
complishment of the idea. The only
question,.then, Is as to ts feasibility.
As written above, the government com
alssion has reported favorably, which
disposes of the general question of the
utility and possibility of the project. It
is possible to takq each section sepa
rately and demonstrate its practlcablli
ty. The first section down from Chies
go would be the drainage canal. When
this was orglnaally planned, a depth of
14 feet was considered sufbelent, but
thbe trustees decided to make It eight
feet more with a view to this very uttl
isation of the canal besides its original
purpose of providing drainage for Chi
cago. The second section, the Illinois
river, ea be dredged to a suraeent
depth, while the third and longest, the
Mississippi, could, in the opinion of ex.
pert engineers, be rendered navigable
by the largest vessels
The M ississippi question is intimate

flsoirs. the lower floor kiiown at the first
nunl 4ry and the upper as second. Here
in were 40 children or nmore. Miss Sarah
Ashdown was in charge for the night
and with her was Miss Brad of the hos
pital ward, who was taking care of two
sick children. The explosion, though
of great force, was not loud enough to
awaken the sleeping nurses.
When the smoke began to pour into
the east wing it was but a matter of a
few seconds before the whole sleeping
population, was brought toº a realization
of the situation with suddenness which
at once woetmed to rob nearly every one
of judgment and mental faculties. A
terrible chorus of cries and groans filled
the air. It was imnpossible to see any.
thing and as the thick smoke poured in
the scene became one of indescribable
confusion. Chief nurse, Miss Ashdown,
did all within her power to save the
children and nurset. When the firemen
arrived on the seene their attention was
first turned to inmates of the hospital
ward in the west wing.
On the floor next to the top was Miss
Brad. With the flames leaping all
around hot it seemed impossible for her
to escape. She did, however, but was
so seriously injured by falling she will
not live. It is stated by the matron
that there were 75 girls in the west
wing. Besides there were two children
and two nurseifiu the hospital depart
ment which was also in that wing. It
is estimated that all thle inmates of the
west wing, have been gotten out, either
dead or alive.
Many children were taken away
early and the numlsr saved and those
dead and injured could with great dif
,f lty be countted.
The latest report is the identified dead
at the asylum had reached J6 children,
e nu nre and a cook.

Berlin, Jan. 9.-The diet was opened
today in the name of Emperor Wil

von Buelow, who read the speech from

was 1he announcement of the presenta

but also the oonstruetion of a waterway
for large ships between Berlin and Stet

BATTLE AT LINDLEY.
Ders Defeat British Near Where Other
fMattlte Were Fought.
London, Jan. 9.-The fresh affair at
Lindley, where the British already have
had many mishaps, is vaguely described
by General Kitchener. The force re
ferred to as the bodyguard is not Knox's
own guard, but a distinct organization,
either a corps recruited by (General Rob
erts for his personal protection during
the march from Modder river to Preto
ria, or from the other South African
contingents.
Military men do not understand that
Knox himself was with the force at
tiuwkedl by a Boer commando of sunprior
strength, but explain that several Brit
ish columns are cooperating in the pur
suit of DeWet and that one of them
has been sharply engaged with the
Boers and lost 40 officers and men killed
or wounded.
The fact that the wounded have been
taken into Heilbron indicattts that Gen.
Knox's mounted force has followed De
Wet from the Orange andl (olionl riv
ers in the southeastern ac"ner to the
northern edge of the ('onry toward the
Veal. lie has not ~oun diverted from
his pursuit by ra;s of marauders south
of Orange riv'-r, but has traversed the
c(ountry, kL'ping on tlhe right side of
the rail:zhy. He1. has a roving c-, on is
misailr, evidlent'v. nand hats Iwen iinoti
fil'd to follow D),Wet it., hlmg as his
r:orses are tit.
The Lindl.ey affair probably will turn
out a , pr sues.css, either on the Iart of
DeWet or ,f f,'rces whi-h have crossed
the Vaal. broken through the railway
cordon at Rhei.inter, and rea-ched Litld
