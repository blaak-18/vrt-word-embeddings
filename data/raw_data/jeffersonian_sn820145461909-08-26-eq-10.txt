‘‘By George, I never saw anything
like the effects of that new treatment,
Protone, for the building up of weight
and lost nerve force. It acted more
like a miracle than a medicine,” said
a well known gentleman yesterday in
speaking of the revolution that had
taken place in his condition. ‘‘l be
gan to think that there was nothing
on earth that' could make me fat. I
tried tonics, digestives, heavy eating,
diets, milk, beer and almost everything
else you could think of, but without
result. I had been thin for years, and
Xi
Any Man Or Woman Who is I'hin Can
Recover Normal Weight By the Re
markable New Treatment, Protone,
began to think it was natural for me
to be that way. Finally I read about
the remarkable processes brought
about by the use of 'Protone, so 1 de
cided to try it myself. Well, when I
look at myself in the mirror now, I
think it is somebody else. I have put
on just 30 pounds during the last
month and never felt stronger or more
‘nervy’ in my life.”
Protone is a powerful inducer of nu
trition, increases cell-growth, makes
perfect the assimilation of food, in
creases the number of blood-corpus
cles, and as a necessary result builds
up muscles and solid, healthy flesh, and
rounds out the figure.
For women who can never appear
stylish in anything they wear because
of their thinness, this remarkable
treatment may prove a revelation. It
is a beauty maker as well as a form
builder and nerve strengthener.
It will cost you nothing to prove the
remarkable effects of this treatment.
It is absolutely non-injurious to the
most delicate system. The Protone

Build Cotton Factories in
the South J, C. Irvine
(Concluded from Last Week)
Qn the 21st of April last Mr. R. G.
Peters, a millionaire salt and timber
manufacturer, of Manistee, Mich.,
bought 10,000 acres of iron and tim
ber land near Rome, Ga. The land
extends for 25 miles along Taylor’s
Ridge and is covered with valuable
timber and rich in iron ore. The
price was $90,000, —one-half cash.
He is soon to build a railroad and
coal smeltery and spend one million
dollars in working up the place. Ac
cording to experts, in the manage
ment of timber, iron and coal, when
owned by trusts, from 40 to 50 per
cent, of the material is wasted in or
der to realize immediate results. In
being managed in this way, while the
investor makes profits satisfactory to
himself, yet from one-third to one
half of the resources of this country
are sacrificed, and wasted, so
far as the needs of the country at
large are concerned. This will likely
be the case with the property near
Rome. The natural resources of the
country should be conserved for the
good of the country and not allowed
to be wasted by trusts, combines and
the overly rich.
Your forefathers came to this
country when it was a howling wil
derness. They labored in hewing
down the forests, grubbing the
stumps, opening up the possibilities
and making a good land to live in.
They endured dangers, hardships and
privations. They did this for them
selves and their posterity. Why
should not their descendants reap
the reward for which those faithful
old pioneers so earnestly struggled?
Why should Northerners and foreign
ers be invited to monopolize the
benefits? The plea is, we want out
siders with capital to “develop our
resources.” This development busi
ness should be more like true charity
—begin at home. The Indian once
had a foothold in this country. The
w r hite man came and developed that
foothold in such a manner that it
became too slippery for the Indian
to stand on. I once knew an old
farmer who had the finest fruit or
chard in all that country. The free
handed old man was so profuse in his
invitations to the neighbors to “come
round and help yourselves” that his
fruit soon became a thing of the
past.
This cotton business should be a
fight not alone of the farmer. All
true Southerners should lay aside
any class feeling and indifference
they may have, and join in some
plan to better our country financially.
It may be objected that the South
is too poor. When will it be any
richer? Will it be when the inevit
able effects of the tariff system have
placed the people where they can not
buy the necessaries of life? Will it
be when the national banking system
has transferred the money of the
land into the vaults of the favored in
terests? Will it be when all its na
tional resources are monopolized by
Northern and foreign capital and
factories with all the attendant evils
that characterize Northern and for-
C>be
eign methods occupying every avail
able site? Os course, it is too great
an undertaking for individual effort,
but in co-operation and combination
of means there is strength.
The South is not too poor if what
means there is were diverted into the
proper channels. Factories could be
built and operated at almost half the
expense that is required in some
other countries. Some countries with
much less means than the South have
by continued and determined effort
built themselves up in the manufac
turing industry. There is scarcely a
town with a population of five hun
dred but what has one or two banks
where the small surplus has been de
posited for safe-keeping. This is
wise policy, of course, but if it could
be shown that money invested in
manufacturing will yield a larger in
come, would it not show more busi
ness sense—not to speak of patriot
ism—to let the money be used in de
veloping the resources with which the
God of nature has blessed this land?
If a few broad-minded, patriotic,
business men would take the initia
tive, there is reason to believe that a
glorious revolution of affairs could
be brought about.
It may be objected that it is more
desirable to keep the South an agri
cultural country and not displace
quiet farm life with the evils of a
manufacturing country. In this there
will be no choice. If the people of
the South do not build factories, for
eigners will. The advantages are too
great. Os the 100 factories in South
Carolina, which work up 75 per cent,
of the cotton raised, only 8 per cent,
of the capital invested belongs to na
tive farmers.
It is stated on good authority that
at this time $500,000,000 stand
ready to be invested in Southern
mills as soon as certain preliminaries
are arranged.
It may be objected that in old
times W’hen private individuals in
vested in railroad stock and by scoun
drels getting control of a large part
of the stock, the small men lost their
money. In the factory proposition
this would be guarded against. Have
none but honorable, business men in
control. Let the amount of stock
owned by each be limited. Let each
stockholder, if he owns but one share,
have as much voice and vote as the
one who owns twenty shares.
Let the mills be run on humane
and God-like methods. Adopt eight
hours as a day’s work. Exclude
children under 14 years from work.
Let a church be built in the neigh
borhood, so that the operatives can
worship God on the Sabbath day.
Let a school be carried on for the
education of the children.
The South receives between $500,-
000,000 and $600,000,000 each year
for cotton. Manufacture at home and
this amount would be multiplied
many times.
I believe that there are enough
planters in the South financially able
to form large stock associations,
each member not taking an excessive
amount of stock, to begin the estab
