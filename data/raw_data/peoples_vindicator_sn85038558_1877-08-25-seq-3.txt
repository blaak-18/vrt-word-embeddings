The great popularity of the EAGLE
COTTON GINS is established from the
well-known filet that they are the most
reliable, strongest and best-built Cotton
(;ins ever mlade. The Eagle Cotton Gill
runs lighter than any other gin, thus
having a great advantage for planters
who wish to run by horse power. All
the ullltlerous planters who ulse thie Eagle
Cotton Gin will certify to the fact that
wlhenl tiheir cotton is sent to market it
always rilngs the highest market price, t
us nIo other gin cal prliliul e ai fner or a 11o
better sample of cotton th'il the Eagle liec
Cotton (ihsl. Over seventeenl thousand
of the Elagl" Cotton Gins have been ten
made and sold. Dur-ing 'a period of Spl
twenty yeatrs the uidersigned has had
_ the agency of the Eagle Cotton Gin ill A
Necw Orleans. lie has never had a gin
retutrtn:d or rejected out of the imullense
number sold. The saw cylinders of all
the Eage Cotton Gins are twelve itncheP
in diameter, which is two inches larger
than lost other kinds of Gins, thus giv
ing our forty-saw gin mllore teetlh, and I
they are mnor1 than equal to the fifty
saw gins of other makers, who use only
ten-inch cylinders, and the same great
adlvantage of the twelve-inch cyhnder
in large-sized gins can be easily estitma- l
ted. Phlatters who wish a reliable cot- I_
ton gi. with an establishled reputation,
can purchase iull Eagle ,Cottot Gin with
a certainty that they are not making an
tiried experilent, lut will obtain a ly
Scotton gin which is indorsed biy the oldest co
I oid largest pliters in the conttry as to
the lOst in use. A large stock of the cii
