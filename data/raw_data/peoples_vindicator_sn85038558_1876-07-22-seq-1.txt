"Moriendum est INobis:'
by W. C. J.
in my youth's joyous, halcyon hour,
When hopes were bright, and thoughts
were ,gay,
I knew a sweet, and lovly flo.wer,
That bloohmed awhile, and passed away.
Thus, Flowrets on their parent stem,
Of't wither in their earliest bloom,
And We, alas !-as frail, as them
Soon fade and wither for the tiithb.
Sad truth-"our life is but a dream,"
And swift the turbid cutrrent flows;
Light its a shade upon the stretili
Frail as the blush, upon the rose.
Pleasures are plahntomns, to bpeguile,
They yield us bu 'ta mino t 's cheer,
Life sjvery joy, and e'r'rv :,nile,
Is buI~trophetie of the tear.
The morn may break, in elo'ldless ray,
And nature smile in all it's sheetis
But ere that iorn has passed ada~t;
The storm cloud mlay oi'erspread the scene.
We live and love, but all in vain,
Earth cannot give the spirit rest,
Oh I who wdhld live life:'s dream again
The with it's byightest pleasures blest
Then let that struggling moment come,
'Tis but a groan, a grasp, a sigh,
'l'is but the friendly welcome-I-ome,
To live forever ---We mnust die.
'Tis vain to fear the chill of death,
The grave, the coffin, and the shroud.
In that last hout, triumphant Faith,
Paints her bright rainbow dn thie
[cloud.
For all of Earth--the fmnetfal kniill,
Of wasting withering tin!e niust toll,
For death will never coase to tell,
Ther'e nothing real but the soul.
And that shall live where angels are,
MIids't heaven's brightest gems enshrined
Till, Time and Earth, and sun aid star,
Have vanished freod the angels' mind.
The Germans for Tilden vi
TIHEIR StUPPORT LIKFLY TO dIVE A 01
DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY TO WISCONSIN. ei
A gentleman who stopped over f
,here on his way front St. Louis, gives tli
!interesting information, detived from 9
the Hon. Alexander Mitchell, of Mil
waukee. He has heard that gentle
man say that that State would cast
her electorill vote for Tihden dnd Re- e"
form, and that a bet had been made u'
on such a result. "I tell you, mat,," tl
said Mr. Mitchell5 "that is a good bet. T
'tihe Germans of Wisconsin and the P'
Germans everywhere are tired of the
abuses, peCal:itions and wrongs that f
exist ini the public service. They
want reform ; they are determined to Is
have it." This gentleman, was still P
inlredulous. "I tell you," said Mr b
Mitchell, "I mean what I say. iis- ti
conein will vote fur 'Itiden Trlle bet i1
you speak of is a good bet."  ti
Mr. Alexander Mitchell is one of "
the first men in Wistnhiit Anld all
the Northwest, a man of caution, pro- a
dence, sound judgment, perfect in- '
tegrity, who enjoys more of the con
fidence of the business peopl in Wis- it
consin thtan perhaps any other citi- '
zen iii that State. He is prince among
the men of bbsiness, a leafier atinng
the whole people, and everybody's a'
adviser, who has done a great deal P
to develop growth and prosperity in "
the Northwest, who holds great sway,
not odly in all business transactions
but over public opinions. Nobody tl
knows the people better, and no d
man's judgement is better to be re- e
lied npon: His opinion is confirmed a
by the following account of a cenver- 11
sation with Col. E. A. Calkins, of tile
Milwaukee News, which appears in m
one of the Western papers:
R.i-How are the Wisconsin Ger- c
I manst P
C.-All fbr Tildkii. They do hot onn
derstand why all the dishonest men a
are opposing Tilden. They do not ii
, eary that all anti-Ti.den men are ras- t
cals, but they say that all the rascals
are anti-Tilden. Not a scotundtel in i
the Penitentiary, or out of it aid on t
his way there, can be found without E
his being at once recognized as anti
I'ilden. 1
R.-And as to Wisconsin ? .
C.-That iM the only State north- t
west of the Ohio river, with the ex- I
ception of Indiana that will go Dem- i
ocratic next fall. We can carry Wis
consin for Tilden on no platform ex- I
cept his simple record as the only I
man in the Democratic party who has I
had the opportunity, and has used it, I
to take the villainous rings by the I
throat and choke them to death.
LIEUTENANTS HUDOsoN AND'MCIN
Tosn.-The names of these two men I
will be found among the list of killed 1
in the recent bloody fight between
the United Siates troops and the In
,f dians. These names are familiar to
our readers. Both played an iufam
ons part in our election in 1874. They
were the base and brutal and willing
1d tools of Dog Merrell in committing
b- the most unwarrantable outrages
upon the respectable citizens of North
le Louisiana, to frighten them from the
polls on the day of election. Hodg
son was the individual who arrested
quiet and inoffensive gentlemen, put
them in irons and hurried off to a dis
tant jail at night without giving them
an opportunity of saying farewell to
their families. He was subsequent
ly eourtmartialed but that was simply
a farce.

[ Wýshington G;azet1e.)
The thirteen reconstructed States
cast ninety-five electoral votes, or jTii
itmore lthan one-fourith of the whole li-lg
number. All these States vtoted for alns
Grant in P18O, except (Ieoi'gia and plI
LouiSiOna, which, voted for Seymnur, an
and Mississippi, Virginia and 'Texas. hil
which not being then fully restored an;
to the Union, did not vote at all. For wit
several years nine of these States den
were stronglholds of the Reptblican No
party. Latterly they have gradually ma
become Demlocratic until at the tpros- tjl
enlit time the Republicans have a hith- Ti
er feeble hold upolt onily Soith Caro- It
lian, Florida and Louisiana. Mir
In the pending Presidential cani-- amn
paignhthe reconstructed States are the Sti
key of the position ; and unless the say
Relpublicans can defeat the Demo- tin
crats in three or fainr of the States He
now held by the I;tter, they have ino fe
hope of esc:llie. Hence, they look pol
upon tississipp, Arkansas, Louis- we
istiinn anid Alabama with a covetous Ipa
eye ; andt if violent counsels prevail ilts
they will resort to the desperate ex- set
pedieut of the bayonet for recovering. not
their lost ground in the South. uill
WVell, let them try it, 'Then, when wil
it is too late to ifiotit by the fact, til
they may learn that an influential eye
body of Republicans in the North be
will not tolerate further iuttenip5 to tin
carry elections in the South by stuf- (il
ring baliot-boxes according to umartial
law, nor look quietly on while peace
able citizens are denounced as han
ditti because they protest against
such tºttiages; Nevertheless, it be
comes more and more apparent that of
the Republicans, hard pressed by the
emergency, contempiate a raid of
violence in the coming Canvass in four
or dtve cf the reconstruicted States. i
The Democrats need not be ahlarm
ed at this intervention by the sword.
'Fourevery electoral vote thus wrenched Ir
from them by terror and coercion,
they may gain two in the doubtful D
States of the North and West
The Radical party seem to have
established the precedent that the
negroes of their party are entitled to isl
the offices of Lieutenant Governor,
Treasury, Secretary of State and Su
perintendent of Edueation; and the
white branch of the party to (Gover
nor, Attorney fedieral and Auditor; an
The generosity of the white branch
is therefore apparent ; they give four ini
places-on the ticket to their colored `a
brethren and reserve only three tot is!
theriiselves. Bddle people might itay

than four, but we do not supllpos the 111
negroes will complain. The present w,
division of offices seems t Ibe tacitly fill
aecepted, and has so established it- thi
self by prescription that the negro t,
leaders in the convention did not lies
itate tio cry "The Secretaryship of pr
State is our," when somebody sug- lii
gested a white Itadical for tht office.
They seemed to. think this s s Luchl
an interference with their own
personal property as if a man had
walked off with their coat.
It can not be truthfully denied that
tlie Democratic House has already
done an imnmense deal to titect a high i
er standard of duty and to encourage Hi
and organize the people in their priv
ilege of insisting that no man of bi
questionable methods, or of arty i
shadowy record, shall be entrusted
with the highieat official powerAs. The '
case of Mr. Ilaiue is immediately tin O
point. It can not be doubted that,
while the main witnesses against hint
are Republicans, the agbticy of hiis cl
investigation and exposure has been
the Democratic committee.
And we do daot hesitate to say thnt cl
had the Commnittee of Investigation
been Radical, it would have bushed
up and suppressed thie inculpatory t
evidence, just as the directors of the c
Union Pacifile Railroad suppressed the
fact of Mr. Blatne's counnection with
thie $65,000 Arkansas and Little Rock
bond swindle, for fear it might it
Sjare his chances of re-election to the
Speaker's chair. So mueh of thantks
do the genuine lovers of refori
throughout the country, whatever
their party affiliation, owe to the ef- I
forts of the Democratic House to fer- n

The Repubtikani iia'e idleu too
long in power; in a free government
no party can be safely trusted to rule
for so long a term. They have also
had too great miajority in the country
and in Congress, leaving them aluiost
without responsibility. They haite
grown tyrannical and they have
grown corrupt beyond all precedent.
Their moral deitay tiannot bei eig
Sgerated in words. They moust be
turned out. That is the only pies
Shilptioo that is adequate to the dis
f ease. The worst Democratic admin
f istration will now Ibe better than the
best one that the Republceau party
