tn ordering primaries to nominate a

ceiving a plurality of the votes be- t

-.act~t ted by ._a.pattiOtI eQotive.
They joined the Democratic party
to fight 'fr the preservation of re
ligious freedom, but they never re
nounced the cherished idea of their
leader, the great Kentuckian, the
promoter of the American system
of protection. With -them protec
'tion by the government was an ar
ticle of political faith, which, like
religious faith, may temporarily lay
dormant, but will revive and bright
en at the least light of hope.
When the Republican party came
into existence and attained ?ower,
advocating Mr. Clay's system of 1
protection, many Southern men
would have gone to their first love
and joined that party had it not
been for its cursed policy on the I
negro question, with its allies, the
ravenous carpet-baggers and sneak- 1
ing scallawags. Patriotism agaln
kept these men in the Democratic
party; but now that the negro has
ceased to be a dangerous factor in
politics (for the present at least)
and the carpet-baggers have sneaked
back in their holes, a new state of t
things presents itself and that light
of hope is glittering before the eyes ,
of every protectionist. The na- i
tional Democracy and the Demo
cratic president don't want protec
tion for the sake of protection,
which is nothin'g but class legis
lation. They don't want to tax the
people in excess of what is needed I
to run the government. To that r
extent the Federal government has I
the right and power to tax the peo
ple; but that tax should be limited t
to a tariff for revenue only. Every- s
thing in excess, whether to protect C
or foster any particular industry, is t
extortion. The Democratic doc-o
trine has been and is to levy du- "
ties as much as practicable on for
eign goods which come in compe- y
tition with home goods; so as to
incidentally assist our industries
without making the consumers con
tribute more than is needed by the a
government; but this comes in con- d
flict with the interests of the bene
ficiaries of the McKinley law who
are howling that the Democrats have
ruined Louisiana and grim and l
hideous poverty is staring them in a
the face.
A similar condition of the public s
mind existed when President Jack- i<
son caused the public moneys to be
removed from the United States 3
Bank. Orators predicted the utter
ruin of the country; resolutions
were adopted at public meetings i
condemnatory of the President; ii
party leaders and even members of c
the cabinet quailed under the pres
sure and deserted their flag. The t,
Democratic party was threatened z
with disintegration, but Jackson I
remained firm; he had faith in the a
good sense of the people and put c
his trust in them, and they stood h
by him. The bank lingered and si
died, and its votaries were politi
cally buried with it. So it will be f'
with the McKinley bill and those
who cling to it, for the voters are a
too intelligent not to understand ti
that the aim of government is to P
secure the greatest good to the C
greatest number, and not to tax the
masses to enrich a favored class of a
citizens. s
TIE SCHOOL BOARD. a
The School Board held a special h
session last Saturday for the tran- 0
saction of urgent business, but
strange to say nothing of conse
quence was accomphlished. y
Without going into particulars it ir
would appear from the record that
the Board has acted very inconsis
tently in some matters. In the se
lection of teachers great care should
be exercised and employment given I)
to none but sober and competent 2
persons. Nepotism and favorit;sm c
should have no influence in such fr
matters especially when the efficien- of
cy of the schools is made a sacri
fice. ti
A proposition of deep importance th
to public education has been sprung FA
by certain members ot the Board. aI
It is the apportionment of funds to art
the various wards upon a pro rata vi
basis. This had been the plan gov- th
erning the Board until recently, iir
when, by unanimous vote, the funds
were placed in one general fund"
with the proviso that each ward
should be entitled to ten months
of school per annum. Several
members are now demanding that i
the old phu -of fts 4atai t*iutoil- b
e posed and in fact reduce the, tesrm
V,'in several, istandes to five months
Er thereabouts, while other wardts
will have a sunipus at the end of the
Sfull term. Tbe' Board, representing
e-,interest of the whole parish,
cannot fail to appreciate the ad
avadtages of the system which will
insure the longest term without
prejudice to the interest of any par
ticular ward or section. The rev
senues of the Board for the present
fiscal year will amount to $12000ooo
or perhaps more and with this
amount available it is very plain
that the schools can be maintained
throughout the parish for the de
sired term. Considering.that the ex
penses for all scool purposes last
year were $9g00 and making due al
f owance for increased disbursements
this year the above conclusion is
quite evident. Let the Board unite
in harmonious action for the wel
fare of the entire parish and all will
be welL Unless this is done se
rious consequences are likely to re
sult, and the cause of. education
placed in jeopardy. The Board is
composed of conservative and lib
eral minded men, and we feel as
sured will not abolish the present
system until its efficiency over the
old plan has been fairly, tested.
B. O. Flower's paper on "Early Environ
ment in Home Life" in the September Arena
is a plea for a larger measure of common
sense and justice being exercised toward
young folks growing into maturity by
parents and guardians in regard to the
proper functions of their bodies, and the
relations of the sexes. It also shows the
destiny-shaping force of the moral ideas in
the atmosphere in a child's early years, and v
loving care and intelligent sympathetic home
surroundings and education can overcome or
mitigate even bad hereditary' tendencies.
Beauty and truth, high ideals and example
and candor about all those physicial facts of t
life so freighted with moral perils is Mr.
Flower's ideal of education for children.
He believes parents do not feel their respon
sibilities enough; they think the whole of
education is school books and the Sunday
schaso'~IfThe fe51es(:atiirences of all are in
the daily lives and thoughts of the parents.
A Few Notes From Franklin.
To the Lafayette Gazette:
As turn about is fair play, I send
you a small contribution this week. a
Business, I believe, is pretty good h
for the season, and there is room
for more business men. Frankitn
will soon be the happy recipient of
a new merchant from Lake Provi- b
d-rnce, La. The gentleman's name c
is Moore, and the family will con
sist of the young merchant, ands
his mother and sister. i
It is very healthy here to date.
Mr. A. G. F ere- has been ill for d
a few days, but is up again, and
Mts. Geo. Alpha has been confined it
to her bed and room nearly all
summer from general debility, but
Iis gradully regaining her strength. I
Excursions are very frequent this 1
year, and as we have a navigable
.stream, we have a number of boat
excursions in addition to those la
given by the Southern Pacific. The
Ladies' Aid Society of my church it
in connection with the W. C. T. U.
chartered a boat and gave an excur- op
sion down the Teche via Cen- h,
treville, Patterson and Morgan City s
to Shell Island. The colored citi- S'
zens give boat excursions frequently. ,
They have an elegant brass band, of
and when they wish the black
cloud to gather, they only have to
pound their drums and toot their
horns. They are great for " 'scur- ht
sions." cc
Perhaps some of our Lafayette
friends would like to know the re
sult of our silver wedding. Not
withstanding a light rain, we had
a nice crowd present and a nice
time. Ice cream and cake in su
perabundance. T'Ihe crowd sipped
cream and ate cake from 6 to 5o
p. m. and yet did not eat it all.
The presents were silver of course,
and consisted of a sugar bowl and
spoon, a butter dish and knife, a
pair of napkin rings, a set of table
and tea spoons, and thirteen bright,
hard silver dollars. We recieved
one beautiful piece of silver coin
from Lafayette. This is certainly
a green spot in our life, which can
never be forgotten. With love for
you and "Jim," and every one else
in Lafayette, we put down a period.
Cordially, H. ARMSTRoNG.
The Cream of Current
Thought.
PUtntsc OPINION, published at Washington,
I). C., is a weekly journal devoted to the
reproduction, in condensed form, of carefully
selected magaziqe articles and of editorials
comment from the representative daily and
weekly press of all political parties, and
frio all parts of the country. The readers
of PIutLIC OPINION get all sides of every
question. It is just the paper that the f
farmer and villager need for general reading. 2
it keeps its readers fully abreast of the
times and supplies them with the' best
thought of the day in the fields of American
Affairs, Foreign Affairs Sociology, Commerce,
Finance, Religion, Science, Education, Art,
and New Books. Pu£a.lc OPINION and the
rural weekly supplement each other admir
ably. Together they give the farmer or 0
-.illager and his family more of current news,
editorial comment, and magazine literature
than can he had in any other way for five
times their cost- The price of PuatLIc
OPrINION has been reduced from $3.oo to
$2.5o per year. We have just completed
arrangements by which we can offer Ptr'lec
O-PINION and The Gazette for $3.0oo cash
per ycar.
