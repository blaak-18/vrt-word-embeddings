The Right Way.
Below we copy from the Shreve
port Time.. how to reap the fruits of
our victory, and if we cannot get
them any other way, we will do it.
r It will not take us long to go through
the list in this Parish. Look out ye
scurvy scalawagsl I Beware ye Pimps
is of usurpation, the eyes of the people
are on you :
Is Wewant no representative on the
returning board; no favors or conces
,e sions from Kellogg and Packard. Any
compromise we might make with
them in this matter, any travor we
,n might accept from them, though neith
er legally nor morally binding, would
l prompt the country, after we had been,
as we certainly will be, it we had
been swindled as we certainly will be,
if we yield an inch to reply to our
protests that we had accepted the
stake, and that having lost we have
e, no right to complain.
s. We know the results of the elec
tion in every parish ; the returning
board cannot change the count of a
of single precinct without perpetrating
4e fraud and violating the constitution
f. and the most sacred rights of the
i people. Therefore we should simply
give the members of that board to
g distinctly tunderstand that, unless
they return the elections as they were
returned at the polls, they and those
n they seek to"count in," will pay the
forfeit with their lives.
We have no appeals to make to our
efellow.citizens of New Orleans; we
's know that the men of the 14th of
September will do their whole duty
as freemen, and Louisianians zealous
e of their liberties. But throughout
e the country parishes there should be
s concert of action, and that action
s should be prompt and emphatic. In
every parish where the officers elected
0 by the people may be counted out by
the returning board, the people should
use hemp or fall on the defeated can
didates counted in. To localise the
e proposition: If Geo. L. Smith is
counted in over W. Mi Levy, or if
Twitchell is counted in over Elam,
a let Smith and Twitchell be killed ;
if Johnson and Tyler, in DeSoto, are
counted in over Scales and Schnler,
s as the New Orleans Republican thinks,
+ or if Keeting, Levisee and Johnson
in Caddo are counted in over Vaug
han, Horan and Land, then let John.
son, Tyler,' Keeting, Levisee and
a Johnson be killed; and so let every (
e officer, from Congressman down to
constable; in every district and par
ish of the State, be served whom the
people have defeated and whom the
r returning board may "count in."
We cannot afford to be defeated by
saing of political scoundrels after we
have triumphed, There is not only t
$ $250,000,000 worth of property at
stake, but also the commercial and a
agricultural interests of the State;
and above all, the supremacy of law ;
the preservation of society and of civil
liberty depended upon our action.
Human life msay be precious; but the
B lives of all these carpet-baggers and f
radical politicians in Louisiana, are
valueless, compared with the worth
of a single principle of justice and n
liberty. 1

SThe destruction of a bhmu o corpse
is notso easy a thing as might be
supposed. Dr. Welbster, in Boston,
rainly attempted the cremation of Dr.
Parkmen. reensaere, the London
murderer, threw away the head of his
victim, Mrs. Brown, in one suburb of
Ioadon, her body and arms in anoth
er, and her legs in a third locality.
They were all found, put together
and identified. Nearly one hundred
years earlier, Mrs. Catherine Itayes,
who has been given a new lease of
infamy by Thackeray, tried to dispose
of her murdered husband very much
in the same way. Eugene Aram was
brought to justice fourteen years af
ter he had murdered and buried
Daniel Clark, by the discovery of the
rermains. Colt barreled up the body
of Adams and shipped it for New Or
leans, and yet every one of tN se as
sassins was tried, convicted, and suf
fered death either by the executioner I
or by suicide.

' An Illustrated Monthly journal, universal
I ly admitted to be the Handsomest Pe
riodical in the World. A Repre
sontative and Champion of
American TJ ate,
THE ALDINE, while issued with all the,
regularity, has nono of the tempo,rary or
timely interest characteristic of ordinlary
periodicals. It is an elegant miscellany
of pure, light and graceful literature; andc
a collection of pictures, the rarest speci
ilens of artistic skill, in black and white.
Although each succeeding number affoird
a fresh pleasure to its friends, the real
value and beauty of the ALDINS will be
mllost appreciated after it has been Lonul
up at the close of the tear. While other
journals may clahuim superior cheapness, as
compared with rivals of a similar class,
the ALIuNE is a unique and original con
ception--alone and unapjroached - abhs,
nlately withhOut conlpeitieon in price or
character. The possessor of a colmplete
volume cannot duplicate thoe qnantity of
Iine paper and engravings in any other
shape or number of volumes for ten times
its cost; and then, there are the Chromos
besides !
ART DEPARTDIENT, 1874.
The illustrations or the ALDINE have
won a world-wide reputaloin, anld in the
art centres of Euratpe itis an admitted fact
that its wood cuts are exanlmples of the
highest perfection ever attained, The
comlmon prejudice in favor of 'steel plates'
is ralpidly yielding to amore educated and
discriminating taste which recognizes the
advantages and superior artistic qualty
with greater facility of production. The
wood-cuts of the ALtINE possess all the
delicacy and elaborate finish of the hiost
costly steel plate, while they afford a' bet
ter rendering of the artist's original.
To fully realize the wonderful work
which the Aldine is doing for the cause of
art culture in America. it is only neces
sary to consider the cost to the people oe'
any other decent representations of the
prodclltions of great painters.
In addition to designs by the members
of the National Acadeuty and other noted
American artists, the Aldine will repro
duece examples of the best foreign masters,
selected with a view to the highest artis
tie success and greatest general interest.
Thus the subscriber to the Aldine will, at
a trifling cost, enjoy in his own home the
pleasures and rctining inthlences of true
art.
The quarterly tinted plates for 1874 will
be by' Thus. Moran and J. D. Woodward.
The Christmnl issue for 1874 will con
tain special designs appropriate to the
season, by our best artists, and will sur
pa-s in attractions any of its pralecessors
Premiums (or 1874.
Every subscriber to the Aldine for 1874
wi 1 receive a pair of chromos. The orig
inal pictures were painted in oil for the
publishers of the Ahldine, by Thomas Mo
ran, whose great Colorado picture was
purchased by Congress for ten thousand
dollars. The subjects were chosen to rep
resent ' The East" and " The West." One
is a view of the White Mountains, New
Hampshire; the other gives the clifl' of
Green River, Wyoming Territory. The
dilference in the nature of the scenes
themselves is a pleasing econtrast. and af
fords a good display of the artist's seope
and coloring. The chromosare each work
ed from thirty distiuct plates, and are in
size (12 by 11) and apsaumnee exact fae
similes of the originals. The presentation
of a worthy example of America's greatest 1
landscape painter to the subscribers of the
Aldine was a hold but peculiarly happy
idea, and its sucncessful realization is at
tested by the 'following testimonial, over
the signature of Mr. Moran himself:
Newark, N. J., Sept- 20, 1873.
Messrs. James Sutton &, Co.,
Gentlemen--I am delighted with the
proofs in color of your chromos. They are
wonderfully successful represenutations by
mechanical process of the original paint
ings. Very Respectfully,
TuHoMAs MomLu.
These chromos are in every sense Amer-. I
ican. They are by an original American
process, with materials of American man- I
ufacture, from designs of American scene
ry3 by an American painter, and presented
to subscribers to the first successful Art i
Jonrnal. If no better becanse of all this. I
they will certaitly possess an interest no '
foreign production can inspire, and neither I
are tlley any the worse if by reason of pe
culiar facilitiea of production they cost
the puplishors only a trile, while EQUAL
in every respect to other chromos that are
sold singly for DOUBLE the subscription i
price of the AbwIsx. Persons of taste
will prise these pictures for themselves
not for the price they did or did not cost, I
and will sporeciate the enterprise that
renders their distribhtion possible1

The Saturday Evening Post.
The Oldest and Best Story Paper Pub
lished.
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever borne a
widespread and unblemished reputation
for the unsurpassed purity, refinement
and excellence of the Serials, Sketches
and Miscellaneous reading matter.
It is pre-eminently
The Best Farhily Paper
that is published in this country, from its
never containing anything that would
offend the feelings of any one, either in
a religions or political sense, or that
could not he read at any fireside without
objection firom the imost fastidious.
The circulation of the Saturday Even
ing P'ost, through not quite so large
perhcaps, as its younger contemporaries,
is not, like that of somec of thema, fluctu
ating, and too oft'ten short-lived, but
SURTE, SOLID AND SUBSTANTIAL,
based upon the intrinsic merit of the pa
per itself and not dependent on any ex
tranmeous iftlueuneces,.su:h as the populari
ty of individual writers, &c.
Good, however, as the Saturday Even.
I ing Post has been in the past, it is our
intention to mahke it still better in the
fitnre, and with this oblject in view we
will effect a marked improvement in eve
ry department of the paper, and will
call to our assistance writers of admitted
ability and known reputation.
By incereasing its former attractions,
and adding many judicious and ipleas
ing novelties, by studying how to please
and cultivate the popular taste, by in
creasing industry and enterprise, and by
enlarged facilities, we hope to make new
friends with etach and every issue, and
continue to maintain the claim of the
Satuirday Evening Post to its title of TirE
OLDEST AND TUE BEST Of Falmily Story I
Papers.
