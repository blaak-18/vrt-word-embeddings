rl ymptla of maa sLInie.
AAIN in the right side, under the
Idge of the ribs, increases on pres.
sure; sometimes the pain is in the left
side; the patient is rarely able to lie
on the left side; sometimes the pain
isefelt under the shoulder blade, and
it frequntly extends to the top of the
sho ero , and is sometimes mistaken
for rheumatism in the arm. The stom.
ach is aected with loss of appetite
and sickness; the bowels in general
are costive, sometimes alttenative with I
lax; the head is troubled with pain,
accompanied with a dull, heavy sen.
saton in the back part. There gen.
erally a considerable loss of memory,
accompanied with a painful sensation I
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done. A slight,
dry cough is sometimes an attendant.
Scuptient complains of weariness
and debli; he s easily startled, his A
feet are or burning, and he com
plains of a prickly sensation of the
skin; his spirts are low; and ahhou h
he is satisied that exercise would be
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely
snmmnon up fortitude enouglhto try it.
I fact, he distrats every remedy.
Several of the above symptoms attend
the disease, but cases have occurred
when few of them existed, yet exam.

shown the utEts to have been exten.
