PRIMITIVE BAPTIST
Martin, Tenn.
“I had a curiosity to see
whether the Primitive Baptist
was as unfair, hide-bound, ar
rogant and abusive as the pa
pers run by missionary fa
natics. ... To my agreeable
surprise I found that the
whole build and spirit of the
paper was up to my ideal of a
Christian paper. ... In choos
ing your religious reading,
you might give the Primitive
Baptist a trial, even though
you are not of that faith and
order. You’ll get some really
religious literature, if you
do.”—Thos. E. Watson in The

The Peculiar Lecture Delivered by
Northern Lecturer
On the night of Lee’s birthday, at
the leading negro Congregational
Church, in Atlanta, I heard a lec
ture on the “Gospel of Uncle Tom”
by the Rev. Charles Stowe, son of
the famous author, Harriet Beecher
Stowe, who wrote “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin.” What was the object of the
lecture I did not learn. It must not
have been money, for no admission
was charged. Just why Mr. Stowe
should be going over the South talk
ing about the “Gospel of Uncle
Tom” is not plain, although he man
ifested many evidences of good in
tentions and sincerity. Really, how
ever, I don’t think he will do much
good by coming down here and giv
ing to our Southern negroes the lec
ture that I heard that night.
As to what he said of the “Gospel”
of that famous negro character, he
made a few statements about toler
ance, forgiveness, etc. The weak
point of his lecture was not in em
phasizing the “Gospel” as manifest
ed by that character, but on the con
trary laying more emphasis on
bloodhounds, bleeding backs, rice
swamps, fleeing slaves, separation of
negro children from their parents,
aristocratic women of the South who
would not do their own work, and
the race of Northern women from
whom he was descended who were
not ashamed to do their own house
hold duties. Such unnecessary state
ments and useless statements, state
ments that can do no good, state
ments that do not fairly represent
the conditions that obtained in the
slave-holding States previous to the
War, received undue emphasis, and
the “Gospel of Uncle Tom” was left
in the background.
The speaker received loud and
prolonged applause from the big au
dience of colored folk when he said
he was proud to say that he was
descended from a race of women
who were not ashamed to do their
own work. He tried to hedge off
criticism, however, by paying com
pliments to the Southern people, ap
plauding their nobility and sincerity.
He made a good point in saying
that it was economic forces that
caused the war, forces which were
quite different in the two sections
of the country, forces which made
the negro profitable in the South
after the invention of the cotton
gin, and forces which made slavery
unprofitable in the North. He did
not emphasize the fact that it was
the unprofitableness of slavery in the
North that caused them to abolish
that institution but he laid all man
ner of stress upon his contention
that it was economic forces that
caused the Southern people to be
lieve in the righteousness of slavery.
It was the sight of fugitive slaves
in the North and her employment in
her household of fleeing slaves,
where she heard their cries of cruel
ty, that caused Mrs. Stowe to -write
her book, said the speaker. “If God
gives me strength I will write some
thing that will arouse the people
against the horror of slavery.” That
sentence is in substance what Mr.
Stowe said his mother uttered many
times before she wrote “Uncle Tom.”
Another statement, which he had
heard her make over and over
again, is this: “How would I have
felt if you, Charles, had been torn
away from me as you lay in your
cradle?” He says the book was writ
ten by his mother in a spirit of per
fect tolerance, that the book is fair
to Southern conditions at that time,
that his mother thought the South
ern people would be pleased with the
book and was astonished when she
heard of its reception in the South.
This is a peculiar thing: He says
the book was written as a blow
against slavery, and at the same time
his mother thought the Southern
people would be glad to read it, en
joy it, and believe it.
Mr. Watson: —At this lecture sev
eral negroes spoke and read Scrip
ture, but I did not hear one word
about Lee, beyond the bare an-
©be '3teffersontan
nouncement from the pastor: “This
is Lee’s birthday.” I heard a good
deal about the “pen that broke the
shackles of four million slaves”, but
I did not hear one word about the
enormous debt that ten million free
born American citizens owe to those
selfsame shackles.

Land Owners as Residents
Editor The Jeffersonian: — Cotton
has a kingdom but no king. And if
we are to judge by late manuvers of
the market, the law of supply and
demand has taken wings for parts
unknown and the gambler has his
heel on the farmer’s neck, while our
lawmakers stand serenely by and
cry, “Lay on Mac Duff; there is but
one way to handle the farmer and
that is to keep him poor.”
But a word to the wise may not be
out of place. The South has reached
its acme in raising cotton and a
“bumper” crop is far beyond the
power of the weak few who are now
tilling the soil. The land-owners by
the one-crop system have worn out
the soil. They have not cared for
their lands, but have scarred them
up with holes and gullies; have
hewed down the timber and filled up
the streams from the mountain tops
half way to the Atlantic and Pacific
with the cream of the soil. And now
Nature in all her beauty has lost all
charms for the land-owners. They
have taken refuge in the towns and
cities, where the sunshine is not so
oppressive and the days are turned
into night; where their children can
go to school, the men fishing and the
men fishing and the women to the
clubs and the farms to the d .
The land-owners are the cause of
the strained condition of the coun
try. It is they and they only who
are responsible for the depopulation
of her best citizens, and it is they
who are guilty of the sin of commis
sion and omission against Mother
Earth, unborn generations and the
Giver of all blessings to mortal man
by allowing or permitting the virgin
soil to wash away, the lands to be
come defaced with gall-sores, wash
es, deteriorated soil, dilapidated
homes, destruction of timber and the
maiming of the fountains from
which all blessings flow.
In Georgia our good, although
sick and sore “Mother Earth”, is a
world within a world. She possesses
eight out of nine of the agricultural
resources or divisions as designated
by the United States Department of
Agriculture. From her bosom grow
to perfection all things that will
grow in any other State in the
United States, except Florida, which
has only the advantage in tropical
fruit and plants. Yet our farmers
are poor. The man who guides the
plow or wields the hoe is strained
to make buckle and tongue meet
year in and year out. The wealth
of the State has migrated to towns
and cities.
Now, when you are told that our
farmers are in fine fix, growing in
wealth, living in luxury and ease, be
lieve it not. It is the fellow who
fills up at a fish fry or picnic that
writes those beautiful stories. The
truth is farmers have no money com
