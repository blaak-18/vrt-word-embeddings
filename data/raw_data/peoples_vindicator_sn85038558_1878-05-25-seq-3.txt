out We won the fight, but Wells. Anderson
& Co., would not aldmit it, and the early
oelr days of Jamnuary, 1877, found Nicholls and of

th. Where now were the "Conservatives" lette
ry and the "Extremists f" What relation
his had they to each other, and to the exist- New
isu ing status? I mean the leaders, or more man
rte properly the managers. - The fight at the disci
ci- polls had been won, but who was going the I
;' to do the work of winning the more Im
.A' portant fight before us ?
ar- The situation was plain. Packard had the
es barricaded himnself inside the Statehouse, vati
lE8 filled with armed men, and he had the best
troops of the United States to back him.
All the wiles and arts, the "peaceful" derv
and "legal" ways of so-called "Conserva- off;
tism." could avail nothing against him,
He had even filled the room of the Su- err
preme Cot rt, (his right arm, under the "vil
,ID Constitution) with armed men. We tai_
could easily inaugurate Nicholle, but we
must lop off Packard's right arm at the and
same tite Could we do it "peacefully," tiw
"legally ?" Not a bit of it. Could, or
i. would so-called "Conservatism" do it? 1itH
No, it was not in their line. How then?
This was work for "extremists," for the
ina- "White League;" and on the 9th day of
Ivo- January, 1877, they did the work well;
t is they established the Nicholls govern
n", ment at the point of the bayonet. Es- 1
LD88 tabliehted it, did I say ? Yes, but not so Col
you thoroughly, not beyond all cavil or care, the
iers as they could and would have done that pot
po- day, if so-called "Conservatism" had not ool
s of interfered again just as the Supreme Dii
and Court was taken. The military men in
' we control knew that all they had to do was
new to open one embrasure on the Packard ool
iOz fortress and demand instant surrender, to
ittle and surrender it would be; and they so for
the advised the civil authorities under whom ste
tical they were acting; but the "Conserve- an
te to tives," so-called, were at work again, and
pla- the lalfloaf was advised and accepted.
eem The idea was that Grant would be mad mu
if we troubled Packard, and then "all the de
it is fat would be in the fire;" so they called
tpec- off the troops and inaugurated a cam- fe
verb paign of so-called diplomacy. We had
set- cut off Packard's rightarm-the Supreme
elli- Court-and Grant had not lifted a tinger
.eing -'had not even growled; but terrible re- hi
,the sults at Grant's hbnds might follow if we hi
ly'- plied up some cotton bales in Ex-' es
etter change Alley, and pointed a gun at Pack- -
thtard's belly!
athrt Wonderful fatuity! Fetal lack of po
e our litical eagacity!-in Grant's utter si
e ng. lence on the subject of seizing the Sn
us in preme Court through force of arms, the
u "extremists" argued Grant's entire wil- I
ek n liUgness that Packard should fall. He
ek on had never said more than that his troops
ihhof should interpose to stop actual conflict,
asall and to the military mind there was no
des- more danger of contlict in taking the
den- State House than in taking the Supreme
ievis- Court. This was a logical conclusion.
ns of Has it ever been supported by subsequent
revelations! Yes; a gentleman of bigh
t was standing here, was informed by one of
iy fel- Packard's chief legislltors- a Louisiana
etat an nann-that for three drys subsequent to
the seizure of the Supreme Court, they
ftbioc hourly expected the demand for surren- I
force, der, and that they would surely have
itated surrendered at any time in fifteen min
't by utes. After that, as they found us fcr
Thy of bargain, instead of fight, of course, they,

ed by dtr
itseef This will be marked by the future his
hat on torian as a most important epoch in the
74, it history of our long struggle against the
reolt curse of Radicalism. It was the supreme
rardly moment of the crisis through which we
ded it were passing; it was not availed of; the
atched councils of so-celled "Conservatism"
with prevailed; we passed from the manly po
rough- sition of snecessful aggression against
te on a fiagralit wrong-aegresston that com
gt oof manded the applause of outside commu
nhim- nities-and we lapsed into the low chan
allway nel of huckstering high and undying
of our principles for a half loaf of bread.
o But even after all this, another oppor
e coe- tunity presented itself for our complete
taleeoof redemption. On the night of the 3rd of
od,bad March, our civil authorities received an
-called authoritative dispatch from Washington,
,s-the that they could go on and take Packard's
-s to State House without fear of Federal mo
mocks lestation. They did not do it, for "Con
eli lie servative" reasons. Subsequent accounts
f eeen from Washington told us that Grant's
in, evn tst question on the morning of the 4th,
was whether Nicholls had full possession
sees of of Louisiana-that is, whether he had
weight squelched Packard completely-and he
tllare.e was surprised when answered in the
b ateful h aotwas the peculiar political states
ttoiv ofat that particular mqpent? Why. clear
by the by, that Grant was more than willing to
ngth to retire from offce having the Louisiana
hgrise question settled, and that Hayes would
herre have given his eye teeth to come into of
hersod- lice with no Louisiana uestion to settle.
lustrateA happier disposition o things, for both
ep hope te parties, could not have been imug
ind; ordnlinary political sagacity would
argue directly for it; but one branch of
so-calitd "Conservatmhln" could not, and
the other branch would not see it, and
again the half leaf policy prevailed
Hayes came into otffice to findl two Gov
ernors antd two Legislatures in Louisi
ana, when, goodl Methodist as he is, he
would rather have encountered two full
fltedged devils in the White House.
Were I at all predisposedl to supersti
tion. I think I should at this particular
Snoment htave concluled that Louisiana
was irrevocably ipredesltinedtl to discord
and dlisapp!initment, anItu that bunian ef
fort could do nothing ifoir her; but there
is niot a trace of slluperstition in me, con- OV
se(u1ently I inevitably hold matt respon
sible to himself
I think it may le asserted without the
slightest fear of sucessful (contradiction,
that if the counsels of the "Extremists'
had been adopted on the 9th of January,
the state lHouse. like the Supreme Court
building, would have been taken with
out the firing of a gun. Also, that if
such counsel had been taken on the night
of the 3d of March, we should have put
both Grant anti Hayes under everlasting L
obligations to us, and have had Louisi
ana in pretty good condition for recuper
ation. But this would have been "ex
tremeism," and that did not chime with
the maclhinations of the private wire
pullers.
But it is time this letter was drawing
to a close, and I will finish it by direct
ing the readers attention to a definition
of the two terms "Conservative" and
"Extremist," as it is forced on us by the
foregoing relation of facts.
The Louisiana "Conservative" has
been always for peace when there was
and could be no peace, always for law in
when there was no law; always for or- to
f der when there was and could be no or- fu
der; always for preservation of the pub
- lie credit when by tdealing in, and sus
r taining spurious and fraudulent eviden
ces of indebtedness he was striking it a
t deadly blow; always for the compro
I miie of fundamental principles and the
f acceptance of the half loaf, never for
e the assertion of anything. Such was
e the "Conservative" before and after the
t 14th of September; such is he to-day.
i. The "Extremist" has asserted every
a thing. He asserted that there must be
s peace, that there nlust.be law, that there
t must be order, that there must be public
e credit, through fair dealing with credi
e tor and tax-payer, that fundamental
s principles must he sustained, and that
he never would divide the loaf of honest
d toil with thieves and plunderers. Fi
a nally, he took up arms and wiped out all
f opposition to his assertions.
it Your readers can answer whether Lou
is isiana would to day have been worse or
is better off under the management of the
re "extremists." I say "extremism" is the
ih only genuine Conservatism, and the so
d, called "Conservatism" of the time is
it folly or worse.
