The last has not yet been heard of the
celebrated Tiebborne case. For a gener
ation William Cresswell has been an in
mate of Paramatta Lunatic asylum. Many
people in New South Wales hold the be
lief that be is the true Sir Roger Tich
borne. When the present Lady Tich
borne was in Sydney. a few years ago,
she visited Paramatta and saw Ores
well, but what she learned never hsS
been made public. The parliamdnt of
New South Wales appo uted a commis
sion to Inquire into the mntter, and it has
reported that while it cannot pronounce
that Cresawell is Sir Roger Tichborne
there Is no doubt that Cresswell is no
longer a lunatic. He is to be released at
once, and a syndicate bas been formed to
provide funds to send him to England to
claim the Tichborne title and estates.
Memories of the Tiebborne case are
stirred hr the announceuent of the death
of Colon.-1 Naugle. who was a cousin of
the last Sir Roger. Nangle and the real

The question. "Who is the strongest
man in Waltham?" was put to more than
23 citizens, and in almost every instance
the reply was, "Martin McDonald, the
expressman."
Mr. McDonald was loath to talk about
himself, but after considerable question
ing he admitted that he had made some
big lifts in his time. Hle is a giant in
size. being 6 feet 3 inches tall and weigh
ing 225 pounds. He is built like an ideal
athlete. and he would be easily picked
out as a man of great strength. Martin.
as he is familiarly called by his friends.
has conducted a teaming and express
business in this city for years. Hle has
done about all the piano moving here
since he came, and some of his feats of
strength border on the marvelous.
his biggest lift was 1.800 pounds.
which he accomplished in a gymnasium
On another occasion be lifted an iron
drill weighing WitH) pounds. Hle was
the only man in 34)0 a h.. could accout

sitn are entered in the race and will
vie with each other in the extent
of their magnetic, meteorological and
oceanographical observations. Besides
these new expeditions. Peary, the
American; Sverdrup, a Swede, and a
German-American explorer. Stein, are
already inside the arctic circle with
Andree, the boldest of them all, if he
is still alive.
Evelyn B. Baldwin of the United
States weather bureau, the leader of
the Amnerican expedition, who Is back
ed by the millionaire baking pow
der manufacturer, William Zeigler, is
now in London. He Is here for the
purpose of inspecting ships and to con
fer with various experts on polaric con
ditions and affairs. Mr. Baldwin will
star northward during the latter part
of next summer, and he says he has
decided to proceed by the Franz-Josef
Land route, the Greenland route being
covered by Peary and Sverdrup. Bald
win has had much experience in arctic
exploration, and this, coupled with
youth, hardihood, hor', determination
and almost unlimited financial support,
will make a combination bard to excel.
He was with Lieutenant Peary in 1593
and 1894. Three years later he hurried
to Spitzbergen, hoping to go with the
adventurous Andree on his balloon
voyage. But Baldwin returned disap
pointed. There was no room In the
wicker car which carried Andre. and
his two compaelons into the unknown.
Baldwin then worked out a plan of his
own for the finding of the pole, and it
is generally believed that he is figuring
on including with his vessel's accouter
ment a gigantic balloon.
The Russian expedition under Vice
Admiral Makaroff. which Is to go on
board the ice breaking steamer Yer
mak, promises to be very Interesting.
The sides of the Termak are 15 times
as strong as those of the usual com
mercial steel ship, and she can steam
astern as easily as she can go ahead.
Her propellers can be brought up short
against the most formidable obstruc
tions with engines going at full speed
and not be damaged by the contact.
She has cut her way through solid ice
14 feet thick and through heaped up
or "hummocky" ice of more than twice
that thickness. She is 302 feet long,
with three propellers aft and one for
ward. The fore propeller Is an Ameri

can invention which Admiral Makaroff
has adopted. Its purpose is to reduce
the resistance of the lee by sucking
away the water underneath it.
The plans of Admiral Makaroff for
reaching the pole are based on his az
perience in navigating arctic waters.

't tests given the Yertnak were of a
I:t- catit terd to dtletostrate just
;Lti Iot..i!ilitits her scheme of con
strti:ntott contained. The Yermak was
con,' -ed in March, 1899, and was im
ri- tiitely put at work. April 4 of that
y3 ar she stn sltett into the ice of the
guitf of F-inland. freed six vessels that
Ital bottn hell fast for a long time and
brought thie hack. to St. Petersburg.
'iThrt-e alas after she found 23 other
voe.lt itprisoned behind an ice bank.
'hi o. 1 erttuti smashed into that bank as
a foott tOII tt-:itn assaults an ( piti sing

whieh the ietlound craft came out. A
thirt trip resulted in setting 10 more
sil ts free. while a little later she at
tat kil the ice packs at the mouth of
titt Nova and brought out 90 vessels
which had been held In the river for
wI 'ehls.
The performances surprised and de
li:thted the Itus'tan naval officers, and
Attniir:tti 1:tkaroft was congratulated
and tilt that all he had to do was to
set sail for the pole, and its discovery
would be his. The admiral was pleas
ed. tilt not tndluly elated, and simply
sail Ihat ie would require more trials
before he woutl he satisfied. So In
July. 1-!0. he took the Yernak farther
to the nortliwartd. After striking the

to 15.8 meters In thickness. The Yer
mak, nothing daunted, sailed on as
II serenely as if through tropic seas.
it Tuly 2t1 the Yermak struck a spur of
d Ice which pierced the under part of her
,s hull. She sprang a leak. The hole was
e temporarily repaired. and the voyage
a continued. In the middle of August
another and more serious setback oc
e curred. The Yermak struck bard
ih against a low lying block of Ice. The
te old hole was made larger, and Aug. 17
the voyage was abandoned. The Yer
4 mak was then taken back to St. Peters
)f burg.
Some American naval officers are in
- ciln.di to be doubtful of the success of
DUKE OF AsMRZZL
the undertaking. The chief reason as
eribed is that the ice breaker will not
be able to carry coal enough for the
voyage, and an attending collier will
not be able to go far enough north to
be of service to her. Lord Brassey, the
English naval expert, is inclined to the
belief that the Yermak will ultimately
be successful in the undertaking set for
her. His opinion is based solely on
what she has already done.
In this splendid attack the Canadian
party will be led by Captain rnler, a
seafaring man from his youth, ho has
made the study of arctic exploration
the hobby of his life. His preference is
for a steel ship, and be estimates the
cost of his expedition at about $100.000.
Captain Bernier's first objective point
will be the New Siberian Islands. The
first winter quarters of the crew will
be 500 niles from the pole. Then Per
uler expects to advance slowly, to be
carried to the litle by the gradual drift
of the iee in which his vessel will be
come imbedded. He expects to reach
the pole only during the third summer
of his expedition.
The Duke of Abruzzi. first cousin of
the king of Italy. nnd Fridtjof Nansen,
the Norwegian, will together lead an
expedition into the frozeu north. All
the world will watch them. for each
isalreadyeminent in this line. Theduke.
in his ship, the Stdlla Polare, arrived
within 241 miles of the pole,nearerthan
did any previous explore' and 23 miles
nearer than Nansen bad gone. Pre
sumably the Abruzzi-Nansen company
will start in the race of the nations by
way of Franz-Josef Land over the sue
ceesful route already followed by the
duke.
i Of next year's German route no de
tails have yet been made public. It is
very certain that characteristic Teti
ton thoroughness will make of it a
worthy exponent of the nation which
has produced many men of note in set
[ entifte research. The (ermans have
not been very prominent in investirs
I tions of the vast arctic expanse. and a
new era in the policy of the country
r will be marked by the sending @f this
rival expedition.

OKLAHOMA TERRITORIAL UNIYZRSITT Al
NORMAN.
Any objector to Oklahoma who thinks
we have only Indians here ought to
come here and talk to some of oa up
to date, progressive farmers and b aw
ness men.
Speaking seriously, Oklahoma has an
indisputable claim to admission as a
full fledged state and freedom from the
shackles of territorial government.
Within the 12 years since it was open
to white settlement the territory has
grown beyond the most hopeful expec
tations of its early settlers. Of course
they looked forward to statehood, be
ing good Americans, but they did net
think that In so short a time they;
would be able to demand it as a right.
Nothing since the admission of Caifor
nia has shown forth so well the genius
of the American people for coloniza
tion and their titness, to take a wilder
ness and make of it a civilized comma.
nity.
Figures talk. In addition to our
area and our population, which alone
should entitle t:s to admission. Oklaho
ma proudly sets forth statistics In
proof of our claim that we deserve the
right of ranking with the other sec
tions of our common country. We pre
duce annually nearly 35,000,000 bushels
of wheat 75.000,000 bushels of corn,
150,000 bales of cotton, 850,000 head of
cattle, 950.000 barrels of dour, while
our climate is particularly adapted to
fruit growing. The climate here is su'
perb andbanexcelled anywhere.
Although it is true that 12 years ago
the Indiana roamed around loose over
this territory, poor Lo cuts a very small
figure in the Oklahoma of the present
In the first place, he is outnumbered
80 to I by the whites, so be couldn't
be a danger if he wanted to be. In the
second place: he doesn't want to be.
There are only about 13,00 of them,
and the great majority are educated,
Industrious and law abiding. Along
with white men's ways, they have
adopted white men's clothes, and the
tepee has given place to the frame U
house. It Is an Interesting fact that
one tribe of Oklahoma Indians, the
Osages, are said to be the richest peo
ple in the world.
The history of Oklahoma is short.
Until 1889 whmite folks were scarce,
but in April of thnt year, when the ter
ritory was opleed to settlers, an army
of "boomers" sw' pt in. They liked the
country so well that they staid here,
and others followed their good exam
ple. From time to time the territory
has been added to with lard from Tex
as and from Indian Territory. Speak
ing of Indian Territory. the l'airiauks
bill for the admission of Oklahoma,
which is now before coneress. provides
that Indian Territory shall become part
of Oklahoma. This does away with
the objection that the admission of
Oklahoma would certainly mean the
admission of Indian Territory as a
state.
Oklahoma need not be ashamed to
compare its advance ir mnreantile and
educational matters with any of the
states. We have grown wonderfully
in these respects, and the surface of
the territory is dotted with factories,
banks and schools. Guthrie. the (spi
tal and metropolis of the future state,
has a population of about 12,0X%) and
is a thriving little city whose trade
with the adjoining states and with Ok
lahoma itself is growing every day to
greater and greater dimensions. It is
advancing in every way, and what is
true of Guthrie Is true of all of the ott
er towns that have sprung up in so
'short a time in tikishoma.
In view of all the reasons that might
be urged and of the Nft that no valid
objection ePits we Oklahomans feet
we are asking only a right when we de
mand admassion as a state.
