"Tlhe Etlete s shall n:het in t ,heir

So there is no national conven
tion, or colrlge, where the electoran
Scan meet, and the handful of Wat
Sson elect ors say to the armful of
Sewall electors : "If you don't
n vote for Watson we twon't vote for t
iBryan," Besidesl the Watsonri
electors will be honorably boun I
to vote for Bryan, and the Sewall t
electors so bound for Sewall.
noTherefore, no chance for Watson
in the Electoral college, and we'll
deadlock it and ecarry it over t.
the United States Senate, wheret
fain have us believe we could Ia:uel
Watson sure.

Bro. Clarkson.
A little over one year ago we
made our first, and to date, the last
speech we ever made in Coushatta
At that time the Democrats wore
fighting the Populists through their
platform, their candidates and
their office-holders, and m our
speech we very naturally gave
said Democrats "fits."
We called at Bro, Clarkson's
office that afternoon to exchange
the courtesies of the editorial fra
ternity.
In complimenting us on our
speech, Bro. Clarkson said he ap
proved of most all that we salid in
"skinning" the Democrats and
supporting our principles.
Now, the Democratic platform
is taken bodily from the Populist
platform, the Democratic nominee
is conoeded to be a Populist by all
the best posted Democrats, and the
Democratic managers are trying to
make the Populists believe that
they will allow Tom Watson to be
elected Vice President, and yet
Bro. Clarkson is spending the first
brain power we have ever known
him to put out on the all-patent
Conshatta Citizen, in abusing
"Hardy" Brian and the Populists,
whose votes this ticket' must have
to win.
Verily, Bro. Clarkson is a dais),
but not the free-silver emblem !

You'll Laugh
If You Read
This funny and instructive book
tells in a most humorous way how
the Angel of Liberty took Grover
Cleveland from the White House
in the dead of night, and left him,
ragged and hungry, in Oklahoma
City, to tramp home. Grover's
trial's and tribulations as a tramp
are most ludicrously related, and
his conversations with farmers
and laboring men about the silver
question are very instructive.
Everybody Should Read It.
It contains 176 pages of laugh
provoking matter, and 40 full-page
illustrations of Cleveland as a
tramp.
