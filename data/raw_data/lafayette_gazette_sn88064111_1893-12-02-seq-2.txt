of the Louisiana
rt'm an appeal taken
.aocrat frcm an ad
rendered by a low
iestined, we think. to
t-teaching in its ultimate
if it rstands.
--imes-Denocrat had com
'upon testimony given in a
a time the jury was out of
stody of the sheriff, and the
pourt held that these comments
_ 't be read by the members of
jury, and would influence their
ict, and the higher court sus
this view.
e :-City Item very pertinently
= If this decision stands and can
cited as a precedent hereafter,
iect will be that as soon as the
Sof a case has commenced in
of the courts, a newspaper must
ot say anything about the matter
M issue. Therefore, the best way
:.zzle the press would be to
e the matter it it desired to hush
into the courts,- If it is unlaw
--to publish "anything that may
ptder the eye of a jurymen rel
.'to a case on trial, then the
ic should be excluded from the
.iu'rooms, and if the newspapers
ot print comments upon a
ng that has actually transpired,
Snext natural step would be to
;r the people-the public-not
46da re utter any comment upon tes
'i aimony, or the right, or justice of
.he cause at trial. Such comment
might get to the ears of the jury
â€¢tnd influence a decision.
-" This is certainly a dangerous as
well as extraordinary condition of
society. Under such a state of af
Sfairs, if a newspaper had undoubted
e"vidence that a great crime was be
-ing .committed by perjury or cons
-iracy, or bribery, or through any
:lbeans, by which justice would be
d'defeated, the press is forbidden to
m.tter any warning to the people.
For every injustice done to any
eanse by publication of facts or
comment thereon, there have been
thousands of injustices prevented !
Were a wrong done through a
newspaper, it can be crystalized in
to a case of individual damages, but
so say that a newspaper must not
comment upon a case because a jury
Seof twelve men are supposed to be
sro weak-minded as to give more
'heed to a newpaper comment than
to "the law and evidence," is, to
say the least, rather rough on the
Sjury."
It is to be hoped that the matter
will be carried up to the United
States Supreme Court for final ad
judication, when our "five solons"
will be apprised of the fact that
they have not the power to abridge
She freedom of the press, as this
decision practically aim s to do.
CUn ON SUGAR.
In the proposed tariff bill recent
ly prepared by the ways and means
committee, a synopsis of which has
been published in the city papers,
last Tuesday, the sugar bounty is
repealed by installments by provid
isg that the bounty shall be reduced
,one-eighth part of the respective
amfounts each year, until the eigth c
year when it will cease, and then 1
sugar will be on the free list, thtt is i
if the Democrats remain in power
until that time, for it is more than 1
kliely that if the Republicans regain
th-'te reins of government, the bounty I
.lpll be restored.
While the bill appears to be not t
at all satisfactory to the sugar sec
.-tion, it might have been worse, and
:- all that the planter can in the event I
the bill as reported is adopted by
ongress, is to so adjust their af- t
as to make the most out of tld
on. However, there is hope
- - rom the fact that the bill may r
amended to the sugar producer's
tage in the Senate, if our sen
-so mind, because they can de
'and secure concessions by a
g with some of the members I
'the west, whose states are n g
in beet cultivation.

The question of abandoning the
r- New Orleans mint, as far as mint
o ing purposes are concerned, and
:e making the establishment an assay
office, is again being agitated in
Washington. "The cost of mainten
ance at present is about $xoo,ooo a
year, while to keep - it open as an
assay office would cost $*z,ooo. It
is hair ed. that the mints in San
Francisco and Philadelphia can do
the mintage of the government.
A good way to test the popularity
y of a paper is to count the number
of home advertisements carried in
n its columns, and then compare with
r, its contemporaries. Business men
e place their money where they have
n some reason to believe it will bring
r the largest returns, and if one paper
has more advertisements than an
o other, it is an indication that it can
h give wider publicity, a fact the bus
iness people are not slow to recog
nize.
e In the last issue of the Valley of
e the Teche, its ediror, Mr. Charles
a Delhomer, announces his severance
with that paper, on account of his
o removal to New Iberia. Under the
t able management of Mr. Delhom
f mer, the Valley of the Teche has
t always been one of our best ex
changes. Breaux Bridge loses a
public spirited and progressive citi
zen, and the cause of Democracy
and white supremacy in St. Martin
loses an able advocate and a stanch
- adherent.
That splendid family journal, the
Detroit Free Press, is offering to
, send its famous twelve-page weekly
four months on trial for twenty
cents-clubs of eight one dollar.
r No paper in America enjoys a great
er reputation for genuine humor
and literary excellence. Our read
ers cannot invest twenty cents to
better advantage. The address is

Because you can't see any good
in the world is no reason for wast

bad.
There is no spot on God's green
earth where the agriculturist can
reap a richer harvest for the labor
expended than in Lafayette parish.
The Gazette intends to talk refi
nery until it becomes a reality. It
is absolutely needed, the people
know this, and we hope by cons
tantly pegging away at the subject,
that it might have the same effect
as the constant drops of water
eventually make an impression.
There can be no doubt that if the
Western Union would establish an
office in the centre of town, to han
dle only their own busines, it would
prove a great convenience. As it is
now, the railroad opar.ator attends
to both railroad and Western Union
business, and the former always has
precedence, thereby sometimes de
laying private despatches to the ex
tent of time given to railroad mat
ters.
Come, gentlemen of the council,
let's have that street lamp at Pelle
rin's corner. WVe'll wager on it,
that fl you do so, more than one
will say "well done."
Gbneral Organization Desired.
To All Confederate Veterans :t
I rejoice that a general organization, too 1:
long neglected in this place or this surround
ing country, may come to an organization.f
It is a brotherhood all honorable men must
approve, and which heaven itself will bless.
I call upon you veterans, therefore, to or- r
ganize in this city, where ex-Confederates
may meet in companionship, and particular
ly rally to the support of the high and peace
fl objects to be attained in the "United
Confederate Veterans," and move forward
until by the powers of organization, and per- o
sistent effort, our benificent and (..hristian
purposes are fully accomplished.
