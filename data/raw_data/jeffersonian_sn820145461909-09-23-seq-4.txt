present control by
railways of the waterway terminals
has been restored to the public.
Almost coincident with this news,
the following dispatch appeared:
Chicago, Aug. 31. —Water-front
land valued at some $15,000,000 is
said to have been taken from the
state by railroad and ferry compa
nies of St. Louis, according to re
ports that the members of the legis
lative Investigating committee bring
back to Chicago from their trip up
the Mississippi and Illinois rivers,
where these waters border along this
state.
The charges were made by John L.
Flannigan, representative of St.
Clare county. The ground was made
by changes in the course of the river,
the original meander line being now
several miles from the water’s edge
in some places.
* * * *
Rather peculiar situation, isn’t it?
The public must halt indefinitely,
and devise some means of paying
the railroads for the land stolen from
it by them, before it can proceed to
have any river traffic!
The Mississippi and Missouri
Rivers are famous for making
both gradual and sudden de
tours from their ordinary course.
The writer was recently in a West
ern city, where the “Big Muddy’’
was leaving a wide strip of land,
that it had formerly overflowed, high
and dry. The railroads were filling
it up, ballasting it so there would be
no cutting through again, and ex
pecting to turn the strip into a big
railway yard. “But what right have
the railroads to the land?’’ was asked.
“I dunno,” was the response. Maybe
they had every right to the property,
but the striking fact about the mat
ter was that none of the citizens
seemed to know, or to care. In case
of a route from the lakes to the Gulf,
the point occupied by trackage would
be the very point that would logically
be desirable for docks and terminals.
The river touches the town on but
one side, and it will not be long be
fore the entire water-front will be
railroad property. Many other towns
and cities are in a similar situation.
Are they taking any heed to the.
future? Or are they allowing them
selves to be bottled up? If big places
cannot take of their rights, what will
happen to the little towns and vil
lages?
Instead of waiting until the state
gets control of its docking facilities,
it looks very like the Waterways
Commission was holding off until the
railroads were fully entrenched.

and to add to their larder sent out

was reached when several of them

over, and white men, South or North,
will endure him about so long, and
then clean up the quarters. Left to

have ever known” is the way

in one of those wearisome speeches
he is insulting the intelligence of the
country with.
And this, in the home of the “in
surgents” of the Northwest! Won’t
their constituents be pleased to have
the representatives who stood by
their interests thus villified gratui
tously by the self-invited Big Be
hemoth who plunges heavily “in
their midst” to tell them about
tariffs?
“I am not here to defend those
who voted for the Payne bill, but to
support them,” quoth he. A wise
choice of tasks. Their vote can’t be
defended, but he can still use the
power of Federal coercion and pa
tronage for their “support!”
Mr. Taft solemnly rebuked Gov
ernor Johnson, of Minnesota, for his
recent remarks to the effect that the
West was getting pretty tired of be
ing dominated by a few Eastern
States. This, according to our ven
erated President, was “sectional
ism” and if he could do anything
point of death, Mr. Taft might have
frowned severely upon the Govern
or’s utterances. As Governor John
son was at that moment lying at the
point of death, Mr. Taft would have
displayed a more manly and kindly
spirit by refraining from criticism
just at that time. Governor John
son is still very low and there is
small hope that he will pull through.
P. S. —The .Governor is dead.
Mr. Taft has high praise for Nel
son B. Aldrich, and indorses his
Central (Standard Oil) Bank
scheme.
Mr. Taft has set his face against
the franchise amendment to the
Maryland constitution, on the ground
that it was: “Deliberately drawn to
impose education and other qualifi
cations for suffrage upon negroes
and to exempt everybody else from
such qualifications.” Yet he doesn’t
balk at the following conditions ap
plied to the Filipinos:
“First —Those who, prior to Au-

“Second —Those who own real
property to the value of 500 pesos,
or who annually pay 30 pesos or
more of established taxes.
“Third —Those who speak, read
and write English or Spanish.”
On Woman’s Suffrage, Mr. Taft
says: “They will get it when all
the women want it.” How exceed
ingly fair to make qualification of
the individual depend upon th®
simultaneous qualification of every
one else? Did anybody wait until
all the negro men wanted to vote,
or did the Republican party thrust
the ballot upon them? Does the
Government wait until every foreign
resident wants to be naturalized be
fore allowing one of them to be ad
mitted to citizenship? Not at all.
But we’re tired of Taft. His men

part of the victorious
strikers. For several days the situa
tion again looked black, but quiet
now reigns. A violation of the
terms of its surrender was charged
on the part of the company, in re
taining some of the men who had
been imported as strike-breakers and
giving them places as bosses, the
company having agreed to discharge
these men.
There is no doubt the company
will wiggle out of every concession
it did make, as soon as it dares.

make any sort of job at a great pre

slow to take advantage of this if he
is given his way.

when his captors came: “Have I not

witness the turmoil among the lords
and gentry of England over the ruin
that will ensue if they are subjected
to a just taxation. It was always so.
Perhaps the privileged really do per
suade themselves that their privi
leges are of general benefit to so
ciety at large. Nevertheless, the
sharp cycle will occasionally lop off
some of these accursed class powers
and emoluments and afterwards we
wonder how we could have borne
them so long.
To Mr. Taft’s credit be it said that
he is speaking in favor of the P. S. B.
It is a real pleasure to give him cred
it, for in most respects he is such a
punk bunch of mediocrity it would
be a strain to find anything about
him that wasn’t rather nauseating.
Taft has shown a spirit of most
vicious tyranny and cowardice in dis
missing L. R. Glavis, one of
Glavis Ballinger’s subordinates, at
is the the request of the latter,
Goat. “for unjustly impeaching the
integrity of his superior officer”
touching the Cunningham claims to
Alaska coal lands. Mr. Taft admits
that the matter is to be investigated
further, but because Mr. Glavis has
not been able, single-handed, to in
dict, prosecute and prove his con
tention that Ballinger has done
crooked work, he has been dismiss
ed. He has done as much as one
man could, but Taft is determined
to shield the Secretary of the Inte
rior. His position in this is decided
ly similar to Roosevelt’s position in
the case of the Pennsylvania Re
fining Company and the Sugar Trust,
wherein the receiver appointed in
connection with the foreclosure of
the loan made by the second
to the first company brought evi
dence before the President and
Attorney-General Bonaparte, show
ing conspiracy and fraud, but the
heads of the government refused to
lend any assistance toward bringing
the guilty to justice. Ballinger had to
“hedge” and Taft, as well as every
one else, knows that he did so, by
virtually admitting that things in the
Department of the Interior were rot
ton, but that an under-secretary, and
not himself, was the culprit. Either
Glavis, or Frost or both were there
fore certain to be sacrificed. A
beautiful system all around, that has
the scape-goat ready. Be it noted
that it is a crime to unjustly criti
cise a “superior officer” and that any
criticism made will be decided as
just or unjust by the superior offi
cer himself. If the subordinate does
clean work, and objects to anything
shady, he will be let out. If he does
dirty work at the bidding of those
higher up, and they are caught, he
will have to go.
