M[r. C. O. Mouton, the popular

Opelousas Democrat.
Inadvertently we failed to notice
last week the adveWt of a street
sprinkler owned by and operated for
Messrs. Biossat, Moss, Tolson and
the Bank. We understand that they
get the water from the big well at
the canning factory. Now that the
first step has been taken it would be
a first rate idea for a few others to
join in the profession.
The Gazette has received a half
dozen communications this week,and
as much as we like to publish th m
all in one issue, this is impossil e
'on account of lack of space. T.e
Gazette would beg of its friends to
make their communications as short
as possible, in which case we cou'd
find room for several in each issue.
I-IHowever, in course of time, we
shall endeavor to insert them all.
A ride on a bycicle from New

nesday, looking fresh and <strong
and was confident of reaching his
destination without much trouble.
SThe city authorities are serving
notices on the public to have their
preimieCs clcaned up. This a wi:,e
mnve, inasmuch as "'n ounce of
pre'tion eis better-than a pound
cure." The health of the t6wn
iS good, and ordinary tare exercised
in safitary matters will keep it so.
In a moment of mental aberation

ting a gash under the eye, being

self. He was detained Sunday-in a

self, and his brother was written
to about his condition. His brother
came in Wednesday and took the
unfortunate man to Patouville for
care and treatment.

The Election.
An informal election was held last
Thursday to get the sense of the
property;holders for or against the
stock law recently enacted by the
city council. It had been given
out that the city council would be
guided by the majority vote cast,
which tended to make the contest
quite spirited. The total vote cast
was to7 ; 57 for and So against,
consequently the stock law will not
be repealed. Several negroes voted :
some in person and some by proxy.
The commissionners were Messrs.
Alfred Chargois and R. B. Martin.

Vigneaux asked The Gazette to state
that he would begin to enforce the

Royville Items.
From Onr Regular Correspondent.
Our town was crowded to its ut
most last Saturday; whether busi
ness is dull or not, an auction sale
will always attract a crowd. Our
jovial and popular sheriff has made
quite a reputation as an auctioneer.
You should have seen him with his
'.once !" "twice !" "three times !"
And articles disappeared like hot
cakes. We presume it is "Ike's"
popularity that made him sell his
goods so quick, and we assure you,
he obtained his prices. One of
our merchants informed your cor
respondent that the crowd was a
Broussard one, as he was selling
goods at higher prices than stores
in general.
Our popular townsman, Odilon
Bilanchet, was married last Thurs
day to Miss Lydia Theriot, a charm
ipg and lovely young lady at Ba
you I Large, Terrebonne parish.
The ceremony quietly took place
at the Catholic church, Rev. Father
Raymond officiating. After the
ceremony the happy pair received
the many congratulations and good
wishes of friends and relatives, and
and as they took the evening train
for Galveston and other Texas cities,
a shower oj..rice and old shoes ac
companied them. To the happy
couple we wish unlimited happiness,
a rose-strewn path through life, and
an. undying love, blessed by the
holy and sacred ties that make them
one.
Hon. O. Cade returned from
New Orleans Thursday; he will

we welcome you in our ranks, and
will give you the "knight of the
Pestle" grip when next we meet.
We do not pretend td be mind

is that our sports were "dead in it"
last Sunday when they visited New
