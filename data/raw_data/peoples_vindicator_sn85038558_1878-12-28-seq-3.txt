THE SUN FOR 1879.
TuE SIN will tie published every day during
the year to come. Its purpose and method will
ie tile same as in the past : To present all the
news in a readable shapo, and to toll the truth
though tile heavens fall.
The Siun has ben. is. and will continue to be
indlpendent of everybody and everything save
thei Truth and its own convictions ot'duty. That
is the only policy which an honest newspaper
need have. That is the policy which has won fio
this newspaper the confidence and friendship of
a wider constituency than was ever before en
joyed by any other American Journal.
The Sunins the newspaper for the people. It
is not for the rich man against the poor man, or
for the poor man against the rich man, but it
weeks to do equal justice to all interests in the
community. It is not the organ of any person,
class, sect or party. There need be no iestery
about its loves and hates. It is for the honest
man against the rogues every time. It is for the
honest Democrat as against the dishonest Rep
ublican, and for the honest Repsublican as against
the dishonest Democrat. It does not take its cue
from the utterance of any politician or political
organization. It gives its support unreservedly
when men or measures are in agreeauco with
the Constitution and with the principals upon
which this Republic was founded for the people
Whenever the Constitution and constitutional.
principles are violated-as in the outrageous
conspiracy of 1876, by which a man not elected
was placed in the President's office, where he
still remains-it specks out for the right. That is
The Snn's idea of independence. In this respect
there will be no change in the programme for '71
UThe Sun has fairly earned the hearty hatred
of rascals, frauds, and humbugs of all sorts and
sizes. It hopes to deserve that hatred not less
in the year 1879, than in 1878, 1877, or any yeas
gone by. The Sun will continue to shine on thf
wicked with unmitigated brightness.
While the lesson of the past should be con.
stantly kept before the people, The Sun does
no propose to make itself in 179 a im e~;iue of
ancient history. It is printed for the men and
women of to-day, wlhse concern is chiefly with
theaffairs of to-day. It has both the disposition
and abilisy to afford its readers the promptest,
fullist, and most accurate inteligence of what
ever in the wide world is worth attention. To
this end the resources belonging to well-estab
w lished prosperity will be liberally employed.
The present disjoined condition of parties in
thiscountry, and the uncertainty of the future,
- lends an extraordinary significance to the events
of the coming year. The discussions of the
press, the debates and acts of Congress, and the
movements of the leaders in every section of the
Republic will have a direct bearing on the Pres
idential election of 1880-an event which must
be regarded with the most anxious interests by
every patriotic American, whatever his politi
cal ideas or allegiance. To these elements of in.
8 ierests may be added the probability that the
d Democracy will control both houses of Con
d gress, the increasing feebleness of the frandlent
Administration, and the spread and strengthen
ing everywhere of a healthy abborance of fraud
in any form. To present with accuracy and
ciearnessthe exact situation in each of its vary
ing phases, and to expound, according to its
' well.known methods, the principles that should
* guide us through the labyrinth, will be an imr
portant part of The Sun's work for 1879.
We have the means of making The San, as a
political, a literary and a general newspaper.
my more entertaining and more useful than ever
before: andwe mean to apply them freely.
