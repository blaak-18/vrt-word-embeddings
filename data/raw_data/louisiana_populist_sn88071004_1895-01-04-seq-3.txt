Henry 8tewart, who broke jail
here and escaped last week, came
in Tuesday morning and gave up.
He got in just in time to save his
appeal which was pending, and
which together with ,the fact of
his close pursuit probably brought
him to "taw."
TheSeient and popular Olerk

The Normal School.
XWe had oc,!asiun to pay the Nor
Imal School a short informal call
Monday, and found President Boyd
and several of his teachers just in
from the State Teach# rs Associa
tion held at Monroe during the
Christnmas holidays, while a num
her of the pupils, who had spent
the, holidays at home were just
back. all looking refreshted and
ready for business. Secretary
Fuqua was at his desk, and every
thing was hummfing as smoothly
as clock-work, and with as
mnuch regularity as if no recess
had been taken.
Col. Boyd and his able assist
ants make it very pleasant for viii
tors, event h hough unexpected as
we were, and we fear they will be
troubled with us many times this~
sessioln. \e witnessed the open
ing exercises Monday morning, and
noted the expression of real pleas
ure with which President, teacher
and puplil, each pIerlormed his task,
while we know from personal ex
Iaunination of the curriculum that
these tasks wouldi ordinarily be
consihlered hleavy, on a('COnuit of
ithe thoroughuess of the courses of
study. But this school under its
present management seems to have
a peculiar tact for getting good
work out of its students and
at the same time retaining their
warmest affections.
This State institution is a source
of pride to every Louisianian who
understands it.
