In pursuance of the plan gotton
up by him and outlined in these
columns last week, Mr. J. W.
Freeman went to Monroe to com
plete his arrangements with Chair
man Millsaps in person. This
gentleman expressed himself much
pleased with Mr. Freeman's plans
and Ontured heartily into their
completion.
Besides the $lO00 raised by
himself Mr. Freeman carried 8250)
handed him by drouth sufferers in
advance. The whole amount he
invested ii corn believing if the
people could be secured in their
bread and feed for work horses
that they could make out, while
the committee would have its
hands full to do this. IEight car
loads were ordered, but since his
return four cars more have been
ordered, the 12 carloads to be
shippied as follows: 2 cars to
Marthaville, 2 to Robeline, 2 to
Provencal, 1 to Derry, 2 to Natch
itoches and 3 to Grand Ecore.
The corn ought to be here inside
of 10 days tr.d together with the
State donations for wards 2 and 3
and the parish donations for wards
1, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 0l will we hope
so far relieve the people as to ena
ble every man to remain upon his
farm and ttake a crop this year.
The work of distribution and
sale will be conducted by the Po
lice Juror and two others named
by him.

Let us organize Socialist clubs
in Shreveport. Education on that
line will be beneficial.--Shreveport
Progress.
What the de-nce can be the
matter with Bro. Hicks? As per
extract from the Progress printed
elsewhere to-day, he is found want
ing to hang his delicious Murphy
and his delectable "Bobs H," in
effegy, simply because they turn
out seducers, murderers, boodle
councilmen and such like from the
penitentiary,-as though he did
not know this Wits political neces
sity with Foster to keeli up his
following-and now we find him
preaching the rankest kind of Pop
ulist doctrine ! Watch out Broth
er; you will have the Clarion-Ap
peal's "Sweet" after you directly,
and that means death to a paper-
Peoples Tribune.
The little prodding up which we
gave the Enterprise for ignoring
the drouth sufferers has done much
good, as it now declares that the
more than $5000, now being expen
ded for them is "wholly in ade
quate" and calls for the organiza
tion of ladies relief associations at
central points throughout the par
ish, which we hope will do much
goo,.
The 11th annual meeting of the
State Agricultural Society, willbe
held in Baton Rouge, January 27th,
28th and 29th inst.
Our old friend, Mr. L; Charle
Ville, of Cloutiewrille, Was on our
streets Tuesday.
The Electors in all the States
have met and cast their votesi
Bryan received 178, and McKinley
271. McKinley's majoity 95. Not
such a big beat after all.
Mr. J. T. Moseley of Keachie
has gladdened the hearts of his
many friends by his return td the
Normal entirely recovered from
the llness which took him away
over a month ago.,
The blundering old fogy Demo
eratic press is at last realizing the
extent and seventy of the drouth
suffering, which many of them at
first ignored or denied. A writer
in Shreveport Judge said it was a
Populist craze. They are falling
over each other now to help.
I am applying for pardon.
