What Our Farmers Are Saying and Doing
GIVE THE BOY A CHANCE.
“There is no doubt,” says the Pro
gressive Farmer, “that if farmers
would make farm life more attrac
tive and less of dreary drudgery, the
boys who are suited to be farmers
would be attracted to the farm and
would return there after getting
the proper education. But the duty
of the farmer, as is the duty of every
man, is to give the boys and girls
the very best education he can. An r
education that will educate not only
the mind, but train the hands to en
able the man to do something that
the world needs having done. The
fact that a boy has been raised on
the farm does not mean that he is
always the man for the farm. His
education may open to him lines of
usefulness in which he will make a
better success than on the farm it
self, and, if he has the advantage of
a good agricultural college education,
agriculture will be all the better
if he finds that he is better suit
ed to be a scientist in the sciences on
which agriculture is founded, than if
he returned to the farm with a long
ing to be engaged in those scientific
pursuits. The experiment stations
look to the colleges to train men for
their work, and the farms need the
trained investigators in the stations
fully as much as they need farmers
on the farms.
“Give the boy a real practical edu
cation and then let him take his nat
ural bent, for if he was cut out for
a farmer he will get to the farm
eventually. It is the uneducated boys
who drift hopelessly to the cities.
The boy trained in a good agricul
tural college will always have a place
open to his abilities, for as Mr. Car
negie once said: ‘The world is al
ways on the hunt for men with edu
cated minds and trained hands.’ As
I have before said, this agricultural
,education is the hope of the South,
whether the boys go back directly
to the farm or not, for they will be
a force in the advancement of the
work wherever they go.”

4 HUMUS.
As “the world depends upon suc
cessful farming,” so successful farm
ing depends upon humus. It is the
one element in soils that plays out
first by successive cropping and sell
ing out when it lacks only humus.
Humus is decayed vegetable mat
ter. It is the “dust to dust” process
of plant life. It is that stage of de
cay at which the elements of which
the plant is made are broken up into
the original elements. Humus plays
an important part in agriculture be
cause it is the natural source of fer
tility and the natural reservoir of
the soil. It holds the water from go
ing too deep by percolation or by
escaping through evaporation. Take
a corn stalk that has lain until it is
so rotten you can easily pick it to
pieces. It is capable of holding water
like a sponge. You can not pack it
together in a ball like you can wet
dirt. This is how it plays so im
portant a role in the formation of
soils. It prevents clay from becom
ing too sticky and compact. A plant
must have air around the roots. A
heavy soil in a wet season smothers
the plant. Humus tends to prevent
this. A plant must have a constant
water supply, not in excess nor in
too small a quantity. Humus equal
izes this supply. It holds water in a
drought and assists a heavy soil in
getting rid of too much in a wet
season. —Southwestern Farmer.
BOY AND MULE.
Billie Moore, who is a mere scrap
of a boy and an orphan at that, has
shown what a boy can do when he
has pluck and grit. Last spring he
traded a game rooster for an old
plug of a mule that nobody thought
would live two weeks, paying fifty
cents to boot. Billie’s friends were
«
sure that he had gotten the worst of
the trade. But Billie himself seem
ed to know better. He began feed
ing up that old plug and rented a
small farm. As a result he will make
two bales of cotton, one hundred
bushels of corn and one thousand two
hundred and fifty bundles of fodder.
He did all the plowing with the mule
in question, and now holds the animal
at $25, and refuses to take less.—
Charlotte Observer.
STUDY YOUR SHEEP.
The feed consumed by one cow,
according to Texas Farm and Ranch,
will usually support five sheep, and,
with good care, the returns from the
sheep will often be greater than from
the cow. Those who raise sheep are
able to advise concerning the best
breeds for different localities, and can
give valuable pointers’ on the care of
the animals. Experience, however,
is the best teacher in this respect and
before investing any large amount in
sheep, it would be w r ise to obtain a
few and study their habits carefully.
Short-legged animals are best for gen
eral purposes.
ALFALFA FOR HOGS.
One of the greatest advantages of
alfalfa as a hog pasture is the fact
that it affords fresh growth through
out the grazing season. The pasture
should be moved at least three times
each season, thus taking off all the
matured stems and giving opportuni
ty for the sending up of a new, tender
growth, just the quality the hog de
lights to feed on. It is this new, fresh
growth that makes alfalfa pasture so
generally preferred by the hog and so
highly satisfactory as a flesh former.
The hog wants fresh pasture. He
does not graze like the horse, cow r or
sheep, but is best suited when he can
bite off a clover bloom or a sprig of
alfalfa, and does not from choice like
to feed on a thick, heavy-coated blue
grass sod. He objects to mouldy, wet
or soured ‘grasses, such as the blue
grass and white clover pastures so
frequently afford when not closely
grazed.—From Coburn’s “Swine in
America.”
CARE OF THE DUCKS.
“Cleanliness of the food to be fed
the ducks is very important,” says
Farn and Ranch. “Green foods are
very beneficial and should be fed at
all times, when possible, Mash made
with skim milk is highly nutritious.
Plenty of drinking water in shallow
pans must be provided at meal time.
3effer«onlan
for the ducks wash down most of
their food. In the water should be
a supply of grit and sharp sand.”
LOCATING LAMENESS.
When a horse is lame and you
can not locate the trouble, a writer
in the Horse Review suggests the fol
lowing method: “Buy a package of
common cooking soda, dissolve it in
a bucket of warm (not hot) rain wa
ter, take a clean sponge and apply
the water to the entire hind leg from
the hip to the foot. Then stand the
horse in the sun so as to permit the
coated surface to dry quickly. You
will find that all parts, excepting that
portion wherein the trouble lies, will
dry rapidly, whereas the fevered spot
will remain damp.”
MODESTY VS. VANITY.
A little hen of modest mien,
And not a whit too fat
Just went, without a bit of fuss,
And laid an egg like that:
And when she’d laid a good.sized egg,
Just like a modest bird,
She went and picked her living up,
Without a single word.
Another hen—much larger, too —
Who strutted and looked wise,
Just fussed about before she laid
A dinky egg this size:
o
And when she'd laid this little egg
She had to have her say,
So she went out and cackled, cackled,
Cackled half the day.
—Yonkers Statesman.
Unlike some other products, comb
honey keeps best if stored where it is
warm and dry, in temperature rang
ing from seventy to ninety degrees.
When exposed to frost and dampness
it deteriorates very rapidly.
