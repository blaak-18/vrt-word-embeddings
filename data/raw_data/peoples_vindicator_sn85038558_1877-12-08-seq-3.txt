This is without flattery, the most coin- e

I radical rule, during which rolbcbry, iur

all criminal cases were fixed by our able
District Attorney, Mr. IIHall.

The pIresent condition of affairs, lamIe and
shiftless, can't last always and is serious

'r should be relenbtbered that the financial

0- as to have been easily mnanaged, It only
t- rqulired vigorous action, but unfortu
nately the same old rut was clung to and
re the consequence is the proseitl deplorable
ge condition of affairs.
W. Our city will never be anything until
1i public officials make a move. Every
k- thing is tumbling down. The VFireman's
n.- all, the Market House, the drainage of

th bridges are a disgrace to any city. Pro
th pertry in consequence of all this has de

fire at Waterproof, La., on Saturday
