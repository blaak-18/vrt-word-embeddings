Peter and the Cock Cropping
Jarrar Fenton’s rendition of the
cock-crowing incident about the time
of she crucifixion is not 'borne out or
supported by the original Greek text
of the New Testament.
The Greek word translated 4 ‘cock”
iu all four of the gospels is “alektor”
and means just what the translator
intends to impress upon the reader.
The word “alektor” has nothing to
do with “bugle,” as claimed by Mr.
Fenton.
The circumstance upon which Mr.
Fenton bases his presumptuous altera
tion of the English text is no doubt
the historical fact that no cocks were
allowed to remain in Jerusalem dur
ing Passover week (the time during
which this cock-crowing incident oc
curred). The 'Romans, who had ia
strong guard in the castle of An
tonia, which overlooked the temple,
divided the night into four watches,
beginning at 6,9, 12 and 3 o’clock.
The two last watches were called
“cock Growings.”
The Romans relieved guards at each
watch by sound of trumpet; the trum
pet of the third watch was called the
first and that of the fourth the second
cock crowing. And when it was said
the cock crew the meaning is that
the trumpet or the third watch sound
ed; which always happens at mid
night. In short the trumpets sounded
at the usual literal cock crowing time,
and these trumpet sounds took their
name, “cock crowing” and “cock,”
from this sact —which is proven by
the. use of the word “alektor, ” a
cock, and not “salpigx” (Gir.), a
trumpet, or “gallus” (L.), bugle.
The word used in the original Greek
from which the New Testament is
Miss Sophia s 'Relvard
(Continued from Page Two.)
Carr is come back, and she is pack
ing up all of her things to go to live
with her sister.”
“It must have been very lonely for
her living by herself all these years,”
observed Miss Sophia.
The next morning’s mail brought
Miss Sophia a surprise in the form
of a letter from iMiss Sallie Carr. It
ran:
“Mr. Clark told me of your sending
in the roses. 1 didn’t deserve it.
\ou don’t know, but you will later,
what I did. But I have done all that
I can to put things right. 1 don’t
ask- you to forgive me. I 'hope you
will be happy. Sallie Carr.”
Miss Sophia marveled greatly. She
had not the least idea of the mean
ing of those lines.
“But Sallie was always queer,”
she reflected.
After supper that evening Miss So
phia went into the garden to gather
the last of her white roses to take
to a sick neighbor -a short distance
up the road. It was quite warm,
and she lluad put on a gown of thin
white material which brought out the
fresh tints of her skin ami the warm
brown of her hair.
She was so occupied in arranging
the roses that she did not notice a
Jeffersonian
translated is “alektor,” and means
nothing but “cock,” but there is a
derivative word “alektoro phonia, ”
which, according to Young’s Analyti
cal Concordance, is translated “third
watch,” or “cock crowing.”
Farrar Fenton’s manipulations and
mutilations are adroit —anything these
days to destroy the purity and sim
plicity of God’s Word —but it does
seem that you, Mr. Watson, ought to
be a match for this specious effort
to confuse, and not be caught by it.
I hope you attach no importance to
Mr. Fenton’s translation. The origi
nal tongues of the Bible do not sup
port 'his changes in the English text,
and all you have to do to find this
statement true is to get Young’s Ana
lytical Concordance of the Bible, and
an “Emphatic Diaglott” (two
tongued) word-for-wdrd, interlinear
New Testament. With these two in
vincible weapons of defense you can
catch Mr. Fenton in every lapse he
makes —and his lapses are “too nu
merous to mention.” The Diaglott
would be useful also in helping think
ers get right on the foreign mission
subject. By t'he way, if the foreign
mission methods, motives, men and
manoeuvres are all wrong wihy sup
port it at all? Why not have the
moral courage to “come out from
among them land be separate”? “Fal
sus in uno, falsus in omnibus.” May
be the doctrines of the church are as
false and unscriptural as are some
of her practices and methods. Let’s
poke into some of her pet “scares”
that she uses to force us into member
ship and see if they are not as un
scriptural as her missions.

man who Iliad entered the gate until
■he was half way up the walk. Then
happening to look up she saw him.
He was tall, broad shouldered, with
smiling blue eyes.
Miss Sophia turned red, then
white, and stared at him. He came
quite close to 'her.
“Sophia,” the said gravely and
with much hesitation, “I have dared
to come to you even though I know
what you must think of me. Sallie
Carr came to see .me yesterday—she
told me that all she told me years ago
was not true. She was jealous of you
—and wanted to separate us. I know
that I should not have believed (her —
I should have come to you—but I
was mad 'with jealousy and pain—
then there was my pride. It is hard
to bear—if she were a man! All
these lost years! Sophia, I have loved
you always. Will you forgive me,
■and —Oh. Sophia!”
There was a rustic bench near. Miss
Sophia had sat down on it and tears
were streaming down her cheeks.
She glanced up at her visitor. Thero
was something in her glance which
gave him courage. He sat down be
side her and put his arms around
her. And Miss Sophia did not resent
the familiarity,—National Home
