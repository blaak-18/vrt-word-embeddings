-seemed full of tongue for want of a
drink. The' first thing, therefore, was
to get. .ink. So, on entering the i
tisaber,.jte it down a small, dry tree
an4d started to make a fire to melt my
cupfi'~ if snow into water. This is
qui6ket than cutting through two or
three feet of ice to get at water.
"'Think of -iny surprise, boys, on
seasriing my pockets, to find only one
match. My box l-had forgot to. take
out of our camp the night before at the
foot of the mountain; and it must be
there to this day, amongst the saplin'
branches we laid upon.
S"Well, I thought, this will do. Once
the flie is started,-i will take partien
lar care it don't go out. I built a small
fire on two green billets laid on the
snow, and put my tin cup full of snow
on top to melt. While waiting for this
to take place, perhaps I didn't lean
against a blamed tree that grew near,
where I sat watching the 6re, and fell
dead asleep, and never wokisontil long
after the fire had burnt itself dead 'rut
and myself about froze to the heart.
"The first thing I did was to thank
God that I had awoke again in this
world; for, tired as I was, it puzzled me
to this day how I shook off that heavy
sleep.
"When I had my senses fully about
me, I judged by the height of the moon
above the tree tops that it must be
somewhere about nine o'clock, and the
way some big spruce, pine and birch
were cracking with the frost was
enough to keep weak nerves on the go.
Some of the reports were as loud as
guns going off.
"My first move was to ascertain if
the fire was really dead out. Yes, too
true, there was not a spot remaining.
Well, here I was in a pretty mess-at
least twenty-five miles from camp, and
in what direction I could not tell till
the sun came out.
"Of course, I could locate myself at
that moment'by the moon; but what
tired man would undertake to guide
himself through the underbrush dur
ing the night?
"No blanket, no fire, and nothing to
eat except dry biscuit, which looked
and felt like a stone in that cold cli
mate! Things looked dull. I knew,
to fall asleep the second time, was
death, sure, so to keep my blood warm
and to keep my eyes open, I tramped
around a large pine tree, first with my
snow shoes on and after the snow be
catne well packed I walked around in
my moccasined feet the rest of that
blessed night. And this is the way I
call this yarn 'Circulating,' because I
circulated around that tree all night.
Did I say all night? It appeared to men
like all month or all winter. I never
saw a moon take such a time to crawl
up into the heavens as the one on duty'
that night.
"It's a true saying: 'Everything has
an end.' Even that bitter cold night
came to an end at last; and, although
I was both hungry and sleepy, 1 could
not resist the temptation to follow a
couple of miles on the moose track
just to see how the fellow got along
after dark.
"I had walked about three miles, and
was just on the point of turning back,
when I perceived the trail led out to a
rocky headland or cape. Well. I said,
talking to myself, we will just see how
he slid down there, and then for home.
"You can imagine my glad feelings
when, on spying down over the preci
pice, which was about ninety feet high,
to see mny poose. planted across the
trunk of a pine tree that lay crosswise
on some other fallen trees that hung up
four or five feet from the ground.
"1 was not a great while making my
way around to the foot of the moun
tain, and there I was made acquainted
with the whole state of affairs, as if
the moose had told me the story him
self.
"In running away for dear life"
these are len's own words, and not a
punxf the author-"in his mad rush,
and in the flickering light of coming
night in the forest, he jumped clean
out over the cliff and planted himself
to the heart on a length of dry limb
standing straight up from the pine
trunk. And here I found him."
"Dead?" asked Charley.
"Why, yes," answered lien, "dead
as a last year's corpse.
"I began to skin him and cut the
meat up rough so it would not spoil,
till we could come and get it. While
thus employed, I heard a shot fired
quite close to where 1 was. I gave a
halloo; .and who do you think an
swered  Why my chum, Nick, who
was m irg his way back to camp by a
short cut, and had just fired at a
partridge. ie was just about as
hungry as I was. So we just turned to
and cooked a high pile of moose
steaks. After stowing as much of
thisas w4s good for us, we had a loud
smoke Bnd a sleep the rest of the morn
ing.
"After dinner, by taking a straight
road that Nick knew of, we reached
our head-camp just at dark. Here,
over our evening pipe, we had a mutual
jaw about our moose hunt.
"Nick was not so fortunate as to
find his moose on a pine limb, nor did
he even see him once during the day's
run.
* -" But tell me, Ben,' said he, after I
had told him my story and the night I
had passed, 'why did you walk around
he tree all night?'
"-'Why,' I answered, 'to keep from
freezing; I had no matches.'
•' You had your gun, hadn't you?'
"''Why, darn it, yes, but I never

INCONSISTENT REPUBLICANS.
Harlegla. Tticles of the Party of Bluf
sad Buncombe.
There is something amusing - or
would be if the matter were not a seri
ous one-in the republican attitudo
concerning the protests of Germany,
Austria and France against our tariff
legislation and their threats of retali
ation. For quite a quarter of a cen
tury, and in the cases of some for much
longer, the republican leaders and or
gans have been telling the people that
what we need is a "home market," and
that the great evil of the age is foreign
trade. Volumes of the Congressional.
Record and innumerable columns in
the papersot the republican party have I
been given to an elaboration of this
contention; and one result has been
that a great many of the people, es
pecially in the agricultural dis
tricts, have been led to believe -in
the argument said to .- neer at
the foreign market as utterly un
worthy of consideration in compari
son with the home market. Yet the
moment there is a faint prospect of the
farmer being permitted to keep his
grain and meat at home for sale- here,
the leaders and organs are up in arms,
lambasting the democratic party ton
irritating foreign countries into taking
the course they threaten. Another
feature, scarcely h1 - humorous, i
solicitude these same organs and Lead
ers are manifesting concerning foreign
opinion. Almost as vehemently as
they have advoeatthe home market
theory, have they. b laimed their in
difference to wli foreign countries
think of us or do in reference to us.
"'What have we do with abroad?"
was for a long tinie ilr pet cry; and
the severest char they have ever
brought against r.lolitical opponents
has been one of too much consideration
for foreign opinion or action. Yet if
they can be believed they are all in a
tremor now because two or three Euro
pean nations are dissatisfied with the
legislation of the United States, and
with one accord they are clamoring for
deference to foreign threats. It really
is a very funny case of backing down
on the part of the g. o. p.
Looking at the matter. however, in
its serious aspect, the republican atti
tude is even more indicati e of dishon
esty than of rank inconsistency with
previous professions. The pretense
they are making is that the protest of
Germany and Austria is based on the
abrogation of reciprocity; when the
fact is that it is directed specifically at
the discriminating duty on sugar for
the perpetuation of wihich the repub
lican party is just as much responsible
as anybody. President Cleveland in
his last annual message recommended
the relxal of that provision in the
tariff act-not because of any protest
from foreign countries, for none had
been made-but because the provision
was the result of domination by the
sugar ring. The republicans in the
senate could have prevented the pas
sage of the provision had they
wished-or, to put the matter ac
curately, had they not been ruled
by the sugar combine, as were
certain democrats. They could secure
the repeal of the provision now, but I
it is well known that they have com
bined in the senate to prevent such're
peal, on the flimsy pretense that they
do not mean to allow any tariff legis
lation on the part of the democracy.
Whether their attitude is due to dom
ination of the sugar ring, or partly to
that and partly to partisanship, is im
materiaL It is alike unpatriotic in
either case, and it robs the party or
gans of any excuse they might other
wise have for charging the strained re
lations with foreign countries to the
democracy. The discriminating duty
on sugar ought to be repealed, not on
account of Germany's or Austria's
threat, for we are not accountable to
either of those nations for our legisla
tion, but because it never was right or
for the public interest. Its passage
was due to the corrupt influence of the
sugar trust upon the senate, and that
body will always be disgraced in the
estimation of the public as long as the
enactment remains on the statute
book.-Detroit Free Press.

-Republcans elected to the next

the currency than to undertake that
difficult task themselves.-CKansas City
Times.
-The fact that the leading savings
bank of Connecticut shows a marked
increase in deposits during the year is
correctly interpreted as an evidence
that the state is not suffering from
democratic legislation. The time is
not far distant when there will not be
enough calamity in the country to keep
Mr. AKCinley comfortable.-X. Y.
World.
-The republicans voted solidly
against closing debate on the currency
bill, which was equivalent to voting
against the bill. Of course the repub
licans were not solid in their oppo
sition to the bill on its merits. They
would not be solid on any financial
measure which could come before them.
They are simply solid against any
measure proposed by ademocrat, what
ever be their real views of it, and what
ever be the need of the country for
sonime such legislation. Truly a broad
and patriotic party is the republican
party of to-day!-rrontarille Cou~r~7 *
THE DEMOCRATIC BEOORD,
sppenadd Work In the states Whoe tle
party Was to Power.
In everv state where democratic state
officers are superseded by repiblicans
the retiring administrations go out in
honor, leaving clean records and no
charges of financial dishonesty behind
them.
In states like Illinois and Indiana,
where democratic state officers are in
th middle of their respective terms,
they have presented to the incoming
republican legislatures creditable ex
hibits of the conditions of state affair.
It has been the policy of the repub
lican press to calumniate and traduce,
without reason or measure, every dem
I ocratic administration and every dem
ocrat in office. They could produce no
charge of misconduct nor of dishonesty
founded in truth.
Their sole object was to break down.
by the mighlt of falsehood, abuse and
slander, every public officer not of their
partisan faithu distributing the spoils
totzn and their adherents. The
icas ign of accusation without proof
erd.of denunciation without cause has
aen monstrous in its injustice and in
,U39ency.
ere is not a report.of a defalcation
-pnr of any act of maladministration in
any state that elected democrats to of
fice in 1890 and 1892. Th financial
affairs of the democratic states never
were conducted so well under r pub
lican rule.
The national administration, ma
ligned beyond all precedent and all
rules of decency, has redeemed in
Sgreat part the pledges in the platform
of 1892. The force act, the McKinley
tariff act and the Sherman silver act
were repealed.
A new tariff was framed, far from
perfect in many of its features, but
vastly better than its predecessor. Its
imperfections were forced on congress
by a republican-populist-democratic
protectionist combine more pernicious
than any coalition ever before formed
to pervert legislation in congress. The
panic, the currency demoralization and
the indications of a gold famine come
from vicious and corrupt republican
silver and currency legislation which;
began in 1893 to produce its disastrous
fruits.
These facts show that the democrat
ic party is not-as Reed and other par
tisans have charged-destitute of ca
pacity to administer national and state
affaiirs with wisdom and success.
The democrats in congress have not
been able to agree with the president
on a satisfactory currency measure.
This is not so much evidence that they
lack wisdom for the purpose as that
the condition of affairs, originating in
republican mismanagement, is desper
`at beyond ordinary means of redemp
tion. The disease, of republican ineep
tion and growth, requires a remedy of
unprecedented lowerand efficacy. That
is the cause of democratic failure to
provide a cure- not democratic weak
ness and incompetency.
When the record shall be made up
for history, the verdict will be that the
democratic party, while holding power
in the states and nation, exercised it
well in the interest of taxpayers for
the enactment of judicious laws and to
conserve the financial interests of the
country.-Chicago Herald.
THE PLUTOCRATIC PARTY.
menatorshlps So1t by the Rlepublesas to
Corrupt Corporations.
John M. Thurston is to be sent to oc
cupy a seat in the United States senate,
not because he represents the people
of Nebraska, for he does not, but be
cause he is a professional lobbyist who
has been of great service to corpora
tions interested in using the lawmak
ing power of the people for their own
enrichment.
For exactly the same reason Stephen
SB. Elkins, who is another professional
lobbyist, is sent to the senate from
SWest Virginia, and the Pennsylvania
railroad has apparently been success
t ful in its scheme for buying the New
Jersey senatorship for Lobbyist Sew
ell. If Gasman Addicks is defeated
in Delaware it will be because of the
World's exposures, and not because of
.any objection from those who now con
trol the republican party.
It is true that the plutocratic infln
ence has attempted to control the sen
I ate through the democratic party, but
Swith democrats that has been the ex
ception which has now become the
rulo with republicans. When the
Standard Oil company sent Henry B.
Payne to the senate from Ohio the
democrats of the country repudiated
him and he served his term under con
stant protest from the democratic
press. When Calvin S. Brice through
like agencies secures the succession to
Payne's purchased place it is only that
he may become more odious to demo
crats everywhere than if he called him
self a republican. But in the republican
party there is no longer any attempt to
I resistthe plutocratic influence. Corrupt
corporations are openly purchasing
senatorships for their lobbyists, and
Sare too little regardful of the decencies
Sof politics to keep up the thread
bare but useful pretense that their ao
Stion is the action of the people.
Having won a great victory because
of the protest of deaocrats against
plutocratic influences in the democrat
Sic party the republican politicians are
Susing their new lease of power to re
move all doubt that their triumph Is
the victory of usurped privilege over
right, of money over manhood.--N. Y.
WVorld.
-The friends of Thomas B. Reed,

WOMAN AND HOME.
TREATMENT FOR COLIC.
tih R]ememe of Oar Grandmothers Are
oft Lttle 1re.
Humorous sllusions to "colicky
babies" are never fully appreciated un
til the condition is observed in each in
dividual's own offspring, and then
somehow the humorous side is gone, 1
for of all rest-disturbing ailments,
colic takes the lead.
Overfeeding is a prolific cause, and
very often by reducing the food sup
ply the ailment disappears of itself.
Dut some qualities of the milk will
produce colic, so that it is as well to
have a cure ready. It nearly always
comes at night, but cannot be timed
invariably, for if the mother or nurse
count on a couple of hours of rest
through tha~dasy, it is just as likely to
arrive then. -"Total depravity" can be
applied to colic as well as other things.
The symptoms are sudden, piercing
cries and contraction of the legs. Some.
attacks are very severe, while others
are mild. Catnip tea and paregoric,
the remedies of our grandmothers, are
of the little use, for they only soothe ,
without expelling the wind which
casees the disturbance. Drops and
cordials are useless for the same rea
son. Peppermint was about the only
thing then used which removed the
cause, and that was mahe to stupefy
by adding laudanum.
The remedy now in vogue with uni
formly good results is soda mint. The
tablets are sold extensively for indi
gestion, but a liquid form is best for
babies. Get a ten per cent. solution,
and for a child up to a month old take
one-hall teaspoonful of mint to three
of warm water, slightly sweetened.
Increase the dose with age.
The effect of this simple remedy in
most cases is almost magical. The
wind is thrown off in an incredibly
short time and the after effect is to
soothe the nerves, so that sleep comes
swiftly in its train. There is nothing
deleterious in its composition, for the
the sole ingredients are carbonate
soda, ammonia and pip. menthol.
Enough water must be given to kill
the taste of the soda, which is very dis
agreeable.
Hot applications to the stomach are
of first importance in this complaint.
Flannel bands heated at the fire or
wrung out of hot water, hot salt
wrapped in flannel or a hot-water
bottle next the skin all help n speedy
cure. But no medicine is lasting.
With attention to the diet the number
and duration of attacks may become
shorter, but it will very likely be
three months before they subside.

NEAT SHAVING PAD.
A PlelanLg Present for a Stan Who I.s IIs

A sharing pad is always an accept
able present to a man who is his own
tonsorial artist. A pretty and inea
pensive one is made by taking tw-o
pieces of chamois nine inches long and
four and a half inches in width. Pink
both long sides and one short side on
both back and front pieces. Place
leaves of white tissue paper inside, a
trifle smaller than the covering. Punch
holes clear through paper and chamois,
and lace with ribbon. Tie first in a
hard knot, then in long loops so as to
hang. On one side of the cover place
an appropriate design. The one here
shown is of tan-colored chamois, em
broidered in blue forget-me-note, with
shaving mug and brash clone in outline
with the same color. "Keep your mug

ribbons are used for lacing. Designs
may be painted instead of embroidered.

a nuisance as well.-Detroit Tribune.

the meat on a hot diia and seamon with
