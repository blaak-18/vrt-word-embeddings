THE TWANG YANKEE.
The Caucasian is still 'n eclipse as to
who is responsible for the innovation
of the "Yankee Twang" in the public
schools. Harfter all our solicitude, are
we to be denied the sweet privilege of
an Harnser? Shall our Parst efforts
arouse Nider a eys or Ider a no!
It is understood that the innovation is
not on the "Twang Yankee" but on the
pronunciation and the articulation of
words, as defined in the most approved,
unabridged dictionary. Against such au
htority it would be vain and hopeless
to remonstrate, but is it possible that
our predecessors, our great grand
fathers and mothers, cited now and then
as models of intellectual culture and
refinement, were guilty of such mani
fest ignorance, as would now be heaped
upon them indircetly because, in the
plain, smooth, musical rythm of the
language they would not have said:
"John, Hlarfter milching the Keows,
help Bob to hitch the horse to the Keart,
then drive to the Dapo and ascertain
on which Root Mr. Jones' trunk may
be checked to Ni-York, and, Hafrter
receiving the Harnser, you will advise

Well, perhaps, our ancestors were not
suflicienlty Up-To-Dates, nor were they
"too utterly utter for anything."
Venezuela is in trouble because she
owes so much to so many and can not
pay, while Turkey is on Easy street be
cause she owes so much to so many and
does not have to pay. International re
lafoits develop some queer situations.

cal; it is one of race and color. Why
should President Roosevelt force on
the people of Indianalo a person who
is undesirable to them? In a spirit of
retaliation and coercion. one of the
:nmost powerful governments of the
world has closed the postoffice of a
small town and denied all the people
the privileges of mailing facilities be
cause the people have tired of the col-.
-srcd lady and want a change in color,
:i not in sex. and the citizens in the
aine spirit have accepted the gage of
defiance of an all-powerful government.
The issue is clear and plain. The Roose
velt administration proposes to force a
negress, in an official capacity, on a
community of intelligent people where
she is undesirable and not wanted.
\Vhat a spectacle!
The Standard Oil Trust has raised
the price of coal oil I cent. This will
amount to a tax of between $25.ooo.ooo
and $3o,ooo,ooo. What excuse is there
for such robbery as this at a time when
crude oil was never so plentiful as now?
-Commercial Appeal.
Excuse! Did not Mr. Rockefeller re
cently donate a million dollars to Dr.
Harper's university in Chicago! When
he gives up another million will he not
at the same time make ready to skin the
dear, good people, the consumers, to
the tune of from sixteen to twenty-five
million more dollars? Mr. Rockefeller
has an eye on the dollars. while Old
Nick has an eye on him. There is some
compensation in the reflections of the
hereafter.
The Memphis Commercial Appeal
says: "A young man in Galveston
struggling under the weight of such a
name as Hans Grafbichl von Schoffky
committed suicide. Can he be blamed?"
The Commoner: "The Washington
Post asserts that because of the low
price of silver United States silver dol
lars are worth less than forty cents
each. Has the Post any considerable
number to sell at that price?
The citizen who has paid his poll tax
is legally qualified to "cuss out" the
government. local, parochial, state and
general, if things do riot run to suit his
notions, but the man who has failed to
pay and is therefore disfranchised ha.
no right to kick.
-THE TIMES AND THE SUNDAY
LAW.
The -Cancasian is pleased to note that
the Shreveport Daily Morning Times it
in favor of the Sunday law. All doubt
;n.to its stand was cleared by the edit
oria. iir.its issu ethe Sunday. Morning
Ti.tes o'J"anuary 4, 190o3. Indeed, there
should' have been no doubt, espiecially
when it is recalled that the Shreveport
Morning Daily Times was persistent in
its advocacy of law and order, and thle
enrorcement of the Sunday law when
,Mr. Lake was chief of police and Mr,
.oitzman was mayor. It is true the
Times has not since then been so ag
gressive nor persistent on the vigorous
enforcement of the Sunday law, and
therefore, it may be said in all candor
that . its recent silence, contrasted, in a
retrospective sense, seemed peculiar, at
least. to some people who had anticipat
q4 it encouragement of Mayor Querbes
anof Chief of Police Jones, who have
been striving to enforce the laws, in the
spirit and to the letter, as was then sug
gested and advocated by the Times;
but we beg. pardon, we have digressed
somewhat and as this reticence may be
it.line of policy it would be indelicate
to pursue it further, and we drop it
rifht"hrere We started by saying that
the ~iaeasian: is pleased to greet the
Times as-a champion of the Sunday law
and congratulate all the advocates of
this law on having so strong an ally as
-the Shreveport Times. No doubt the
Journal is on the same line with the
taucasian-well, -the Caucasian never
straddles or evades an issue, and the
eopke always know whereto find it and
how it stands. It is never on the fence.

Msn. Cox Took Her Departure from In

Louisville, Ky., Jan. 7.-A special to

Mrs. Minnie Cox, the colored post

Indianola Monday night for Blrming
ham, Ala., accompanied by her mulat
to assistant. It is now thought therf
is little danger of further trouble, and
although the sentiment of the peoplel
is against the action of the govern
ment in closing the office on accot nt of
the consequent partial paralysis of bus
Iness, no violence is anticipated. Be
fore she left, Mrs. Cox made a state
ment, in which she denied that she,
had been subjected to any indignities
and stated that ho violence had been
threatened her. She said, however.
that she would not again take the of
fice of postmaster under any circuni
stances. Her husband, who is em
ployed in the United States railway
mail service, also made a statement in
which he said that his wife had not
been threatened, but that he under
stood the race problem in the south
and had advised her to give up the
place.
"There Is no doubt," he continued.
"that there is a general sentiment here
against a negro postmaster."

ate r,. on ened Monday after the 1:,'
day re-:,ess, few senators were absent
A!lmost immediately a discussion b;
gan regarding the e-)Jl situation. MAl
Lodge prefaced '-is introduction of
bill suspending for ninety days th
duty on coal with the statement tha
in New England there was much dis
tress owing to the se'arcity of coal
and that unless relit:- was afforded a
once a number of faci:ri: s would have
to shut down. He was aware, he said
that such a bill shchld originate ii
the Thouse cf represtetati ves, but i
was his intention to call the attentior
of the finance committee to the statt
of affairs. .l r. C::! ,e:-asn followet
with a resolution providing for the re
moval of the duty on coal, and askec
its immediate consideration. Mr
Platt (Conn.p objected, saying it wam
his unuderstanding that there was nc
duty on anthracite coal. Mr. Vest
took exception to this statement, ant
said that the board of general apprals
ers and President P.oosevelt had de
cided that such a auty is imposed
Mr. Vest also introduced a resolutlon
on the subject.
Another resolution bearing on the
subject of coal, introduced by Mr

combination among certain railroad:
to control the shipment of anthracite
coal, and called on the attorney gen
eral for the evidence which it was al
lowed had been secured by him. It
caused a lively debate, in which sev
eral Republican senators vigorously
resented what they thought was a re
flection on the attorney general. The
discussion continued until 2 o'clock.

displaced by the omnibus statehood
hill. Mr. Nelson (Minn.) addressed
the senate in opposition to the bill,

HOUSE RECONVENES.
UlnsLuces.ful Effort Made to Pass the Bill
for General Staff fi Army.
Washington, Jan. 7.-The house re
sumed work Monday after a recess of
two weeks, but within two hours the
machinery broke down for lack of a
quorum. The bill to create a general
staff in the army was the issue. An
attempt was made to pass it und r
suspension of the rules, which require
a two-thirds majority. Although all
the members of the minority of the
military committee endorsed it opposi
tion developed because of the hurried
manner in which it was proposed to
pass the bill, and the division 108 to
57, developed that it did not command
the support of two-thirds of those pres
ent. A call of the house followed, but
as the roll showed about thirty lees
than a quorum the house adjourned.
When the house convened DeWit
C. Flanagan of New Jersey, who was
elected to succeed the late Representa
tive Salmon. took the oath.
Mr. Hull (Ta), chairman of the com
mittee on military affairs, asked unan
imous consent for the bill to crea*e
a general staff for the army, but Mr.
Richardson of Tennessee, objected, and
Mr. Hull moved the passage of the
bill under suspension of the rules, say
ing the measure had the unanimous en
dorsement of the military committee.
Replying to a question by Mr. Bartlett
of Georgia, he said the general staff
of the army at present was a 'myth.
Mr. Hay (Va.), a member of the mili
tary committee, supported the bill.
Mr. Slayden (Tex.), argued that th
bill would greatly promote the effi
ciency of the army.
Mr. Richardson (Tenn.). appealed to
the members to vote the measure down
now so that it could come up and be
considered in the regular way.
A vote resulted 108 to 57-not a
quorum. A call of the house dsvelop d
the presence of only 150 members, not
a quorum, and the house adjourned.
DECISION AFFIRMED.
The Chadwhlel Case from New Orleans
Dismlst*ed by Supreme Court.
Washington, Jan. 7.-The United
States supreme court atfirmed the
opinion of the supreme court of Louis
inana in the case of E. M. Chadwick
versus John McKelley. Chadwick as
a property owner attacked the valid
ity of an ordinance of the city of New
Orleans, requiring city contractors to
give bond to employ only residents of
the city in the work in which they may
be engaged. He complained that the
effect of the operation of the ordinance
was to increase the cost of improve
ments to him. The ' .
held that as Chadwick was not a par
ty against whom the discrimination, if
any had been practiced, he was not
in a position to attack the validity of
the ordinance p-
plaint. The opinion, which was deliv
ered by Justice Shlras, affirmed that
decision.
