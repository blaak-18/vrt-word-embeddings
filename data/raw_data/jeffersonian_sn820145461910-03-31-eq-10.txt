By DADDY JIM
SUNNY SOUTH BROTHERHOOD.
Letters in the prize contest and
about the brotherhood will be print
ed on the page allotted to that de
partment.
LETTER FROM TENNESSEE.
A new friend, Gracie Jones, R. F.
D. 1, Guys, Tenn., who is ten years
old, and weighs sixty pounds, writes
a nice letter, but she asks and an
swers riddles which have already
been asked and answered, and we
can not spare the space to repeat
things. Won’t you write again, Miss
Gracie?
ALABAMA SCHOOL BOY.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Will you ad
mit a little Alabama school boy to
join your happy band? Papa takes
The Jeffersonian, and thinks it the
best paper printed. I enjoy reading
Daddy Jim’s page. I am a little
country boy; will be nine years old
April 23d. I go to school at Phil
campbell, a beautiful little town in
Franklin county. My teacher’s name
is Miss Myrtia Bailey, and I like her
very much. I have to walk two miles
to school, and I tell you I have had a
tough time splitting the mud in go
ing to and from school. I will an
swer Lavada Stafford’s question. The
Dutchman builds his hog-pen on the
side of the hill to put his hogs in, of
course. I am looking for that post
card already.—Remus Smith, R. F.
D. 4, Philcampbell, Ala.
SOME BIBLE QUESTIONS.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come
for the first time. I live in the coun
try on a farm. I think I like to live in
the country better than I would in
town. Papa takes The Jeffersonian,
and likes to read it. I am in the
seventh grade, but am not going to
school now. I go to Sunday-school
every Sunday. My teacher’s* name
is Prof. D. F. Shell. I will ask a
question from the Bible: What is
the longest chapter in the Bible? I
will answer Willie Lizzie Stone’s
question: Caleb and Joshua were the
only two of the Children of Israel
that reached the Promised Land. I
am another one of Mr. Tom Wat
son’s namesakes. If I see this in
print, I will try to write again some
time. I will close with love to all.
—Tom Watson Hearn, Chatham,
La., Rt. 2.
LIKES STOCK BETTER.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Is there room
for a little Arkansas boy nine years
old? Papa takes The Jeffersonian,
and he thinks he could not get along
without it. I like to read the chil
drens page. I like riddles fine, but
I like stock better. I have two fine
hogs that papa gave me last winter.
I am going to raise corn this year to
feed them on. My uncle, Otho Polk,
gave me a nice little horse last fall,
but I had bad luck with him. I
turned him In the barn with papa’s
horses, and one of them kicked him
to death. lam going to raise hogs,
and buy me another one. Well, if
this misses the waste basket, I will
give a description of the country
that I live in. Wishing you all a
happy life, I will close. —Oran May,
Prescott, Ark., Rt. 1.
FROM MISSOURI.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come
again. We are living at a different
place. We moved from Olathe, Kan
sas, to Harrisonville, Missouri. I like
it fine down here. We have a nice
school, but it is a small one. We
have but eight pupils. I think it
would be nice to get the Bible ques
tions started, and keep the riddles
going, too. How is a dog’s tail like
the heart of a tree? As round as a
biscuit, as busy as a bee, the pret
tiest little thing you ever did see.
Well, I will describe myself: I am
four feet tall, fair complexion, blue
eyes, and light hair. Well, Daddy
Jim, I wish you would come and see
Ghe
me and I could go home with you.
I would take you to some of- our
towns. I wish I could hear Mr. Wat
son speak. I think he is a great
man. I wish he could be President,
and I think he will. I hope this will
not reach the waste basket, but I am
afraid it will. So, bye-bye to Daddy
Jim and the Post-Card Club.—Thom
as H. Giffin, Harrisonville, Mo.
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?
Hello! Daddy Jim:—Here I come
to join your happy band. My uncle
takes The Jeffersonian, and thinks it
is a grand paper. I like the Post-
Card Club the best. I am going to
school at Pocataligo, Ga. My teach
er’s name is Prof. L. W. Potts, and
we all like him. I am in the sixth
grade. Don’t you all think Daddy Jim
is a kind old fellow to read and print
all the letters he receives? I think
he is, and I think Mr. Watson is kind
to let us have a page in his paper.
This is my first attempt, and I hope
to see my letter in print. I will an
swer Eula Roberts’ riddles. (1)
There was .only one going to St
Ives. (2) There are only two T’s.
Cassie Bolton, I will answer your
riddle: it is a wheelbarrow. Free
man Wilson, your riddle is a watch.
I will answer Virgil Lee Wagner’s
riddle: Because neither one are of
any account until they are broken.
I will close by asking a few riddles:
(1) As I went over London bridge,
I met a woman dressed in red; I’ve
told her name, I’ll be to blame, I’ve
told her name five times. (2) First
white and then black and then red all
over. The first one that answers
these two riddles I will send them a
pretty post-card, and I would like to
receive one from those that I have
answered. With best wishes to The
Jeffersonian and its many readers.—
Your new friend, Irene McClellan.
WHAT ON EARTH IS THIS?
Dear Daddy Jim:—l give a riddle
for the cousins in the Post-Card
Club. If any of them can unriddle
it, I will write some more later. I
am going to help The Jeff to reach
that one hundred thousand mark.
A great big little old nothing-at-all,
Came rumbling and tumbling down
over the wall.
His head it was green, his body was
yellow,
His legs were sky blue, a jolly young
fellow.
He was white, he was black, he was
all over red;
His tail grew out at the top of his
head;
He walked and he flew, he crawled
and he fell;
He ran higgle-piggle, helter-skelter,
pell-mell.
On water, on wind, and away
through the sky,
He flew and he flew, oh, ever so
high.
With a squeal and a grunt and a ter
rible groan,
A thousand went with him, yet he
went alone.
He was drowned in the sea; he died
just for fun;
He froze to death flying too near the
sun.
A gander shot him with a quill of his
tail;
He broke his neck dancing a jig with
a snail.
He played Yankee Doodle with his
nose for a fiddle;
Come read my rhyme, come tell my
riddle.
—E. B. Busbee, Jr., Ft. Valley, Ga.
FROM SHARK, ARK.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l see so many
nice letters in The Jeffersonian I
thought I would write one. I live at
Shark, Yell county, Ark., about ten
miles Avest of Danville, the county
seat. Yell county was named in
honor of Governor Yell. He was
killed at Buena Vista, Mexico. Papa
takes both the Jeffersonians, and
thinks they are great papers. I ans
not going to school now. I will an
swer Vera Baydston’s riddle: I think
it is Adam. We live on the farm;
the creek is near by. I go fishing
sometimes. Papa raises corn, cot
ton, potatoes, oats and peas. Well,
I will ask some riddles: What is it
that goes up and down the hill, and
yet stands still? I am eleven years
old. I like to read the Post-Card
Club. I think Mr. Watson is a great
man. We are having some warm
weather down here. Well, I will
close, as this is my first time, with
best wishes to Mr. Watson and The
Jeffersonian. Hoping to see this in
print, good-bye.—Clara McCall,
Shark, Ark.
THIRD TIME THE CHARM.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here I come
again to join your happy band. I
have written twice before, but guess
it happened to go into the waste bas
ket. My papa takes The Jefferson
ian, and likes it best of all papers. I
sure do enjoy reading the children’s
page and all the rest. Papa thinks
Mr. Watson is a great man. I think
Mr. Watson is Daddy Jim. I like
farm life, but I do not live on a farm.
I live in the city. My papa is a mer
chant. I go to school and am in the
sixth grade. My teacher’s name is
Miss Masie Barron. I will answer
some of the riddles; The answer to
Lee Ware’s is an egg. I will ask
one: What makes a baby and wheat
so much alike? lam going to look
for a post-card from Lee Ware. I
will close, hoping to see my letter
in print, with best wishes to The
Jeffersonian and its readers—Your
friend, Velma Browning, Rockmart,
