THE SOCIALIST LECTURER.
In our last issue we made no men
tion of the visit of A. L. A. Holman,
the Socialist lecturer, who recently
held forth here two days and nights,
'•r the reason we did not have the
space. He had fairly representative
audiences to hear him, and had he
left off his uncalled-for attacks on the
Christian religion might have created
a very favorable impression. How
ever, he succeeded in securing some
fifteen or twenty names asking for a
charter for a Socialist Local at this
place, several of whom are ladies.
We only heard one of his ad
dresses, but from what we were able
to gather from it, he does not believe
that man was created by an All
wise being, as taught by the Bible.
He advances, on the contrary, the
Darwin theory of evolution as being
responsible for the human family as
it now is, it having developed from
some low order of mere animal ex
istence. Such being his position he
made no plea for anything more than
a mere temporal existence—all that
a person needs from his standpoint,
being a good time while they live,
death ending all, as in the case of
any other kind of animal.
For our part we must confess that
we were disappointed in Mr. Holman.
We had expected to hear the ques-
THE ISSUE
EX-GOVERNOR JAMES K. VARDAKIWS
PAPER FOR THE SOUTH
Published Every Saturday Morning at Jackson, Mississippi.
Vardaman was abused at first: he was called an agitator, an
alarmist, a firebrand; but at last the sober second thought of
the people began to waken and they began to listen. Today
what he has to say on the race problem, is the word of the su
preme authority. Combining all the knowledge or writers on
this question, from dawn of history to the present time, ap
plied and measured by personal observation and first - hand
knowledge, Governor Vardaman has a message to deliver of
huge import to the American people today.

tion of Socialism discussed, but were
treated to a criticism of the Bible
and the cause of Christianity in gen
eral. The country is full enough of
infidelity without men posing as po
litical redeemers going around get
ting the people together for the pur
pose of instilling more of it into
them. As we see it, if Socialism is
to be built up in this country it w r ill
take a different “brand” of political
agitators than that represented by
Mr. Holman.
We learn that he met with de
served criticism at Hudson, Gaars
Mills, Mineral Springs and other
places where he lectured, with refer
ence to his position on religion, the
Bible, creation of man, etc. This is
as it should be, and shows that the
people do not propose to be led
astray by such men and methods. —

Tom Watson is without doubt one
of the most vigorous and forceful
writers in America. He is enter
taining, amusing, instructive and in
spiring and nothing that he ever
writes is dull or commonplace.
Whether he is writing a history of
France, describing the battle of Wa
terloo or discussing present day men
and measures he holds the attention
of every one who is interested in
Obe Jeffersonian
the great drama of life. While many
may disagree with him in his politi
cal issues and in other questions
which he discusses there are few W'ho
will deny his honesty and sincerity
of purpose. We believe that the
name of Tom Watson will be handed
down to future generations as one of
the greatest thinkers and brilliant
writers of the present age.—Weath
erford (Texas) Democrat.
Mr. Watson’s purpose is to save
the Fanners’ Union from certain
traitors WHO ARE STEERING IT
TOWARD THE ROCKS. The organ
ization itself, and the honest men
who are members of it, have no truer
friend than The Jeffersonian.
