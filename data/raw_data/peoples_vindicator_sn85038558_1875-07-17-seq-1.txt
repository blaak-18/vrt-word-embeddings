The Colored People.
From the St. Louis Republioan, (Ind.)
"MIr. Caesar C. Antoine, the color
ed lieutenant-Governor of Louisiana,
is a statesman after the administra
tion's own heart. He told a reporter
of the Galveston News recently that
the colored people of Louisiana, in
cluding, of course, himself, and of the
whole South, would be content for
Gen. Grant to have six terms if he
wanted them, though he was afraid
the North was not inclined 'to look at
the matter in that light.'
Lient.-Gov. Caesar Cassius Antoine
and his friends will ascertain before
they are much older that there are
some other things besides the third
term business which the North does
not "see in that light." They may
rest assured of that whether a Repub
lican or Democratic president is elect
ed next year, their programme will
be materially altered. Heretofore
the colored voters of the South have
done as they pleased, confiding in
the federal administration to sustain
and defend them. Hereafter they
will please to do right, or take the
consequences. The country is thor
oughly tired of the bolstering process,
and determined that the enfranchised
African shall henceforth stand fairly
and squarely upon his own legs, the
same as other citizens, or else step
dowvn and out. This sort of wind
blows strongly frgm the Nortli just
now, and those most directly inter
ested may take due notice thereof
and govern themselves accordingly.
The President's letter in the mean
ing intended, and the meaning as read,
reminds us of a letter once written
by the late Horace Greeley.
The white-headed philosopher wrote
a hand that made one cross-eyed
wit:hout .eatltlng in a deciphering of
its meaning. One day Horace was
penning a lively article that taxed
his gigantic intellect to its utmost,
when a poor printer, above expecto
rating at a knot-hole, shot some of
the fluid down upon the bald head of
the senior editor. Greeley was fu
rious lie wiped his bald head and
swore great oaths in a thib falsetto.
Then lie obtained the name of the of
fending tobacco worm and wrote him
a&discharge. The man accepted the
situation as explained to hlit, put the
note in his pocket, and pulliag on his
coat walked over to the Times build- 1
ingand demanded work. Being ask
ed for a recommendation from the
last printing office at which he had
worked, the fellow coolly produced
Greeley's discharged. It was looked
at from all sides without fetching out
a reading, and at last was pronoune
ed acceptable, and the jour. went'to
work.
He run on that letter of recom- l
mendation for three years, when
Greeley caught him at it.
The parallel to that extraordinary
event is to be found in the way the
Republican, party has taken Gen.
Grant's acceptance of a third term as 1
a note positively declining it:--[ Was.
ington Capital.
General Fitzhugh Lee is back from I
Boston. He spoke as follows at Nor- a
folk a few nights sines: I come tor- I
ward, in response to your call to thank t
Boston as a guest of your own "Ar- a
tillery Blues," not because I expected i
to have a pleasant trip and a good z
time, but I hope for a higher, holier I
purpose-for the good of our State,
our people, and all sections of a com- I
mon country. Oh! how I wish I had a
time to tell.you of the reception ac- I
corded to us by tlhose people of Bos- a
ton-of tie enthusiastic crowds that I
greeted us upon every occasion-how a
the streets were lined with people a
pouring out their welcomes to as and I
bidding us welcome, trice welcouie. a
I wish I could stop with you long
enough to give you some of the Iapany
interesting incidents of our trip. How t
a sightless soldier told me, "General, I
your boys put my eyes out, but I am a
glad to see you here in our midst ;" e
how an aged gentleman, grasping a
both my hands in-his, said, "Gernerals) i
I lost twd sons in the war-the only
two I had-but for public considera- B
tions and for the nation's good, I am
glad to see you and your peoplebere t
at this time." How my hand was g
shalken by people whose overflowing a
hearts prevented a single word of ut- t
terance. Do you know what all this I
meanset It means at that end of the ,
line precisely what the outpouring of i
your people-at this end of the line to t
meet aus upon our return means, vis: a
That the people of this country have
taken this matter of reconstruetion r
oat of the hand of the politicians; ;
that the erest which separated them ,
has been broken at last, sad -the mes a
of the North and Seuath are alast l
lowed to see each other face ttface.
Fred. Douglass says that ie col- I
ored man is as white as anow underl
the light of he~ven, and that's some t
consolation for a negro whenhis mule I

Boyton's Life Saving Apparatus
Paul Boyton has finally succeeded
in crossing the English Channel in
his Life Saving Apparatus. The
time occupied in making tlhe passage
was twenty-three hours and thirty.
eight minutes. The trip, it seenms,
was made under rather unfavorable
circumstances. A part of the time,
there was a stormy wind which made,
the sea rough and hard to navigate'
while, during another part of the
time, a heavy sea fog prevailed. He
landed in very good condition, on
the coast about a mile and a half
east of Dover.
Mr. Boyton certainly deserves the
highest commendation for the pluck
and determination which he has
shown in testing the qualities of his
invention. His course in not asking
the tonfidenco of the public in his
invention until he had thoroughly
demonstrated that it was worthy of
it, is praisworthy. There is but lit
tle doubt now that it is all that it is
claimed to he, and that Mr. iHoton
deserves all the honors which he Ihas
received. But it is a question whetIi.
er the new life saving apparatus will
r be of much practical use. Experi
ence teaches that, in times of ship
wreck and disaster at sea, such is the
terror and disorder that the means of
r saving life at hand, are hardly ever
made available to any very great ex
tent. Vessels of all kinds catty the
t ordinary life preservers, which are
very simple contrivances, and easily
adjusted, and yet, in times of disas
ter, the number who thinks to use
them is very small. This apparatus
of Mr. Bodton is a very combersome
affair and takes time to arrange it
and pnt it in a proper condition for
use. It would require more nerve
and coolness than men ordinarily I
I possess to calml' adjust one of them
while the ship is sinking or is being
consumed by fire. While Mr. Boyton
has shown that quite a little journey
can be made on the sea with his in
vention, it yet remains to be seen
whether a larger per cent of those
whIP meet with accident at sea will be
saved if this new invention come into
general use. If, however, sufficient
notice of coming disaster 'is given, it
may be the means of saving many
lives.-N. 0. Times.
What Country Papers Do.
An exchange combats with con
F siderable vigor the argument that the I
city weeklies are cheaper and better
than the country papers because they
give more columns of reading for the
money. Do the city papers, it asks,
ever give you any home news?
Never. Do they ever say anything
in regard to your own county?
Nothing. Do they contain notices of
your chools, churches, nmeetings, imu
provements, and Iundreds of other
local matters of interests, which your
paper publishes without pay. Not
an item. Do they ever say a word
calculated to drav attention to your
county and its numerous thriving
towns, and aid in their progress and
enterprise Not a word. And yet
there are men who take such contract
ed views of the matter that unless I
they are getting as many square in
ches of reading matter in their own
paper they are not getting the worth 9
of their money. It reminds me of ad
person who took the largest pair of "
boots in the box, because they cost a
the'same as a pair much smaller, "
that fitted him.--Exchange paper. I
r
The famous old racer Lexington, '
the victor over Lecomte, the grand a
old horse that in his wonderful race n
against time over the Matairie made
it in 7:191 in a daslh of four miles and
only had it beaten once and that by ,
a quarter of a second, is dead. He a
died near Lexingtoo,"Ky., on Thurs- p
day last, and no doubt was interred t'
with honors befitting his nloyal atation. Â¶
Wonder if the fact that his time had v
been beaten by a quarter of a second, d
and the further fact, that the arena b
wherein he achieved his greatest a
fame, the old Metairie, hadl been con- 0
verted into a cemetery, conuld have t$
hastened his death 9 His brilliant b
and unparalleled exploits upon the
turf, and the fact that he has been
the "getter" of more winners than
any other horse America ever pro- a
duced, will keep his name and memo
ry green for all time, and the resting- l
place of the blind old hero will al
ways be a spot at which will center a
many of the most delightfnl associ- t(
ations and memories of the ardent *
lovers of the turf sports. If our tal- '
ented poet and painter friend, Theo. t
Moise, does not immortalise his dead e
equme friend upon canvas and in
verse,,oanr faith in human friendship
for noble animals will be rudely tl
shaken. a
A DISOOVarY AaoUT CoaNx.-A wri- si
ter in the Western Rural says: An ni
intelligent and reliable neighbor of li
ours, who has for years been making W
experiments with corn, has discoved
an importance and value in replant
ing corn wrlhich is quite novel and "
worthy of publication. We have al- Pi
ways tlhought replanted corn was of "
veryllittle coUnsequence, but the gen- ei
tilean says: "it is of so much on. ai
sequence he replants whether it is ni
needed or not-or, rather, be plants,
two or three weeks after the crop is
planted, a hill every fifteen row each ol
way." He says: "If the whether tr
becomes dry during the filling time
the sdilk and tassels both become dry
and dead; Ii this condition, if it sr
should become seasonable the silk lc
revives and renews its growth, bat
the tassels do not recover. Then, for
want of pollen, the new elk ils nn- i
able to All the odle.fer whihebit was w
designed. The poll fromA the re. o1
planted corn is then reidy to supply a
the silk, and the ailing is completed." i
He says nearly all the abortive ears,
so common in all ropsl, are cased by
the wantof pollen, and he hal kqqwn h
ears to double their ~ in this second a
flling. C
a Wouldn't Marry a Mechanic.
d A young man commenced visiting
n a young woman, and appeared to be
e well pleased. One evening he calledm
e when it was quite late, which led the
young lady to enquire where ie e had
, been.
e "I had to work to-night."
"What, do you work for a living!"
e she inquired in astonishment.
o "Certainly," replied the young
e 111a11.
"3 'I1 a mechanic."
S"I dislike the name of a mechanic,
f and she turned up her pretty nose.
This was the last time the young
Smann visited the young lady. Hie is
c now a very wealthy man, and has
R one of the best women in the country
s for a wife.
The young lady who disliked the
s nnie of at mechanic is now the wife
of a miserable fool-a regular vagrant
f about grogi shops-and the soft, ver
-dant, silly, imiseralle girl is obliged
4 to take in washing in older to support
I herself and children.
You, dislike the name of mechanic.
ehl! You, whose brothers are but well

Swho is so verdant, so soft, as to think

Beware young ladies, how you
treat young men who work for a liv
ing, for you may ,ne of these days
be a menial to One of them. Far
better to dischargel the well-fed pau
per with all his rings, jewelry, bra
zenness and pomposity, and take to i
your affections the callous handed, I

Thousands have bitterly repented[
their folly who have turned their I
backs on honest industry. A fewI
years have taught then a severe les- I

People who delight in high toned
treaty making, will be happy over
the selection of F. Palmer of the lnter. I
Ocean as on; of the plenipotentiaries
of the grand Indian palaver, which is
to result in a new grab of land. Mr.
Palmer has seen nautical service, and
bears the scars of the Pacific Mail sub
sidy. He was and is of the B. F. Al
len kindred of and loose ffnanciering,
If he must negotiate, it is better that j
it should be with the primitive races.
But we caution the Black Hills pro
prietor to look well to their scalping
locks and their eye teeth, for both are
in danger when Palmer comes into I
their neighborhood. Since his suc
cessfull experiment on the farms of
honest citizens of Iowa for the benefit
of the Chicago and Rock Island Rail
road, his reputation stands deserved
ly high as a land pirate. Spotted Tail

by squatters ino order to dispose of,
at exorbitant rates during the progress
of the improvements under the jet. -
ty system, any material which maye
be found upon these lands..

3. Farm and Household Cjolumif.
ig The Pea as a Fertilizer.
A We invite the earnest attention of
e tillers of thin or worn-out lands to
d the following article from the "Sou
of the Soil:"
Not long since we were conversing
w" ith a very intelligent and successful
piny woods farmer upon the subject
g ot fertilizers, when he informed us
that during one season lie increased:
the fertility of his land fourfold by
, land turning under one crop of pea
vines. It is now claimed by experi
; euced fiarmers all over the South
s that there is nothing better than the
s common field or cow vines for enrich
a iug the soil. We know it takes great
moral courage to turn under a fine
o held of peas, especially when forage
e is scarce, but on the score of econo
t nmy, this is the best 'way to improve
any soil. The labor of scattering the
I manure on a farm is very expensive
t and laborious, though this matter
should never be neglected, so far as
manures collected on the farm is con
I cerned, but the trouble, labor antL
I exponse of fertilizing with the pea is
so little compared with other manures
that we often wonder why farmers
are so prone to neglect this cheap and
eflicient mode of enhancing the val
ues of their farms. The simple pro
cess of planting and plowing is all
" that is necessary; nature scatters the
vines evenly over the ground and
these vines collect the very elements
required to make rich soil. When
the cost is counted all will be aston
ished at the comparative low price of
the pea vine as a fertilizer, when put
on the scale with our cheapest and
best commercial manures. Even sta
ble manure cannot compete with the
pea vine, on account of the labor re
quired to haul out and distribute this
rman ure.
Our farmers have ample time this
season to give a good crop of pea
vines to their lands that require en
riching for the next summer's crop.
Ginger Beer.-One pound hops,
two pounds brow'id sugar, half pound
ginger, two gallons water. To ex
tract the strength of the hops boil in
a part of the water, and boil againf
adding enough more to replace the
evaporating. Strain and put in a
jar or keg of sufficient capacity, with
the sugar, ginger, and a pint of live
ly yeast. Keep in a warm room un
til it has worked well, then draw off,
if yon wish to keep for any time,
bottle and put in the coolest place
you can find. For immediate use it
can be strained off into a large jug .
and cooled.--Exchange.
A premium will be given to every
farmer in Cherokee, Georgia and
Alabama, at the fair this fall, who
will furnish satisfactory evidence that
he has not bought any farm product
this year for thirseuse of his family
and stock.--Rome (Ga,) Courier. -
Removing Dandruff.-The b es t
remedy for removing dandruff is to
dissolve an ounce of borax in four of
water, and then tub the scalp well.
It makes a lather that will wash per
fectly clean. Then rinse thoroughly
with clear, soft water. Ammonia
should never be used, as it is injuri
ons to the hair.
Fumigating Pounltry Houses.-A
good plan for fumigating poultry
houses, is to put sulpler upon live
fire coalsin an eartlhern or iron ves
sel; close tire house tightly for a few
hours, and tire insects will be gone.
Of course the fowls must be removed
before doing ti.

Remedy for Painful Wouands.-Take
a pan or shovel with burning coals
and sprinkle them with common
brown sugar, and hold the wounded
part in the smnoke. In a few e.o
ments the pain will be allayedl and
recovery proceeds rapidly. In my
own case a rusty nail had made a
bad wound in the bottom of my foot.
The pain and nervous irritation waus
severe. This was all remnoved by
holding it in tife smoke for flfteen
minutes, and I was able to resume
my reading with comfort. We have
often recommended it to others with
like results, Last week one of my
men had a finger nail torn out by a
pair of ice tongs. It Ibecame very
painful, as was to be expected. Htelul
in sugar smoke for twenty minutes,
the pain ceased and it promises a
speedy recovery, so says a writer iu
the Country Gentleman.
